Enophthalmos (Figs 1.2-1.3)
Enophthalmos is sinking or recession of the globe
into the orbit and has a variety of causes.Degrees of

Coated Retriever, with deep-set eyes and often

cornealreflection.
Exophthalmos (Figs 1.4-1.8)
Exophthalmos, or proptosis, is the prominence of a
normal-sized globe and associated with a retro-
bulbar space-occupying lesion. It is usually unilateral
and often, but not invariably (see later),accom-
panied by prominence of the nictitating membrane.
The degree of natural exophthalmos, and enoph-
thalmos, is related to breed differences,eg. the
Pekingese and the Pug. Obviously prolapse (dis-
location of the globe to a position in front of the
eyelids) occurs much more readily in the
brachycephalicbreedswith their prominent eyes and
shallow orbits.With a space-occupying retrobulbar
lesion protrusion of the nictitating membrane is
usual. Other clinical signs include strabismus,

Corneal foreign bodies are common in all the

nature.Corneal reaction,usuallyfollowing a sudden
onset,varies according to the size,depth and nature
of the foreign body: pain,blepharospasm or a closed
eye. The ocular discharge varies from clear
lacrimation to purulent.
Corneal trauma is also common in the horse, dog
and cat, particularly in the former with its large
prominent eyes.Trauma varies from blunt trauma
with corneal oedema to a penetrating injurywith

Clinical signs of anterior uveitis
(iritis or iridocyclitis)
The clinical signsvarywith the cause,severity
and speciesbut are not specific to the aetiology:
Pain-may be considerable and presenting
with the usual triad oflacrimation,
blepharospasm and photophobia.
Miosis (Figs 7.1-7.3,7.5).
二
Intraocular pressure low.
二
Iriscolour-in the brown iris the colour is
duller and darker,particularly evidentin the
chronic case (Fig 7.2) and a useful clinical sign
to indicate a previous iritis;in the yellow (cat)
or blue iris the congested blood vessels are
obvious (Figs 7.11 and 7.13),known as
rubeosis iridis.
Flare (Figs 7.7,7.11,7.29),hypopyon

Synechia formation-commonlyposterior
with adhesion to anteriorlens capsule

leading to secondary glaucoma.
Chemosis and corneal oedema (Figs 7.5-7.6
and 7.24-7.25).
Vascularization-usually as a fringe in the
peripheral cornea (Figs 7.5-7.6); occasionally
blood vessels extending onto the anterior lens

Islands of pigment (non-tapetal fundus) may
sometimes occur within the tapetal fundusregion
(Figs 11.5 and 11.10-11.11) and islets, or spots, of
tapetal colours may be found in the non-tapetal
region (Fig 11.10).
Changes in pigmentation and the presence of
abnormal pigment,in both tapetal and non-tapetal
areas, are further common signs of retinal degen-
erations,of both inherited and post-inflammatory
causes.

appears dark grey and pronounced myelination is

(Figs 11.165-11.184)
Retinal dysplasia (RD) is the second congenital and
inherited abnormality of the retina in the dog and
with similarities to CEA.It is usually bilateral but by
no means always on ophthalmoscopic examination.
It is not progressive and the degree of severity of
MRDvaries considerably.The types of RD and the

both eyes are affected and an infundibular type of
retinal detachment is present in young puppies

'geographic' form, retinal folds, varying in number
from one to many, occur in the tapetal fundus
usually immediately above the optic disc in the
central region. In the geographic form a large
circumscribed horseshoe-shaped to circular area,
sometimesassociatedwithseveralfine and tortuous

Other retinopathies(Figs 11.185-11.212)
Asstated above thenon-hereditaryretinopathiesin
the dog are mainly post-inflammatory, often of
unknown aetiology and rarely are active at the time
of examination.They must be distinguished from the
hereditary retinopathies as obviously they have no
significance as far asparents,progeny andrelatives
are concerned.Non-hereditary retinopathies may
affect one orboth eyes and to considerably differing
degrees. In addition,the part（s) affected are often
clearly defined and haphazard in their distribution
in the fundus. There is, of course, no breed or age
incidence. Cases of bilateral severe retinal degen-
eration may sometimes be difficult to distinguish
from a hereditary retinopathy ina breed in which
GPRA is recognized,but a history of sudden
defective vision, as opposed to progressive loss of
vision,coupledwith the age of the animal,may help
to distinguish one from the other.
Sudden acquired retinal degeneration (SARD) is
now a well-recognized retinopathy,but of unknown
aetiology. Cases present with sudden blindness and
with no changes in the ophthalmoscopic appearance,

Chapter
The Optic Nerve
Introduction
The optic nerve (cranial nerve Il),or more
particularly the optic nerve head or optic disc as
it appears as part of the fundus (Chapter 11),
exhibitsa few important conditionswhichwill be
illustrated.The normal appearance of the optic
disc in all the species is shown in the previous
section and there will be a degree of overlap
between the two chapters,as conditions of the
fundus,in particular choroid and retina, not
infrequently involve the optic nerve and are
visible ophthalmoscopically.
The degree of medullation in all the species
varies considerably and this fact doesnot help in
diagnosis.Similarly,the size and colour of the disc
also exhibit normal variations, as well as being
important factors in pathology.
Fig.12.1 Papilloedema (West Highland White Terrier,
7years old)Note the enlarged size of the disc and
congestion of the retinal veins,in particularthe fine
ones on the disc itself.The papilloedema was bilateral
and a pupillary light reflexwas present.

Congenital conditions
Congenital conditions affecting the opticdiscinclude
optic nerve hypoplasia (dog) and coloboma (dog, cat
and cattle);hereditary abnormalities include optic
nerve hypoplasia (dog)and coloboma of the optic
nerve (dog, cat and cattle).
For a summary of causes of blindness,see Table
