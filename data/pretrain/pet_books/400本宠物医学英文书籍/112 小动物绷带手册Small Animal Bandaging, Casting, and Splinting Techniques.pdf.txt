Fg. 1.1. The three layers of a bandage: primary-contact layer, secondary-intermediate layer, and tertiary-outer layer
Components of a bandage
There are three components or layers of a bandage. These are the primary, secondary, and tertiary bandage
layers (fig. 1.1).
Primary-contact layer
the stage of healing, this layer can be used to debride tissue, absorb exudates, deliver medication, or form
an occlusive seal over the wound. The primary layer plays a vital role in providing a wound environment
that promotes healing rather than a layer that just covers the wound. The properties of primary dressing
materials vary widely, and it is important to select a primary dressing that is appropriate to the wound
 im its current stage of healing and to change the type of dressing as healing progresses. Occlusiveness and
absorption are important properties of the contact dressing.
Highly absorptive dressings
Highly absorptive dressings are indicated in the treatment of wounds that are heavily contaminated or
infected, have foreign debris present, and/or are producing large amounts of exudate. Such wounds are

bandage are older techniques for bandaging and provide a means of clearing a wound of exudates and
necrotic tissue in the early days of wound management. For instance, dry gauze may be the most eco-
nomical primary dressing in a highly productive wound where absorptive bandage changes are needed
multiple times daily. However, after three to five days, a contact layer that will promote wound repair is
imdicated, for example, calcium alginate, hydrogel, or foam dressing
With wet-to-dry dressings wide mesh gauze is wetted with sterile saline, lactated Ringers solution, or
0.05% chlorhexidine diacetate solution and is placed in wounds with viscous exudate or necrotic tissue.
The exudates are diluted and absorbed into the secondary bandage layer. As the fluid evaporates, the
bandage dries and adheres to the wound. When the dressing is removed, adhered necrotic tissue is also
removed. Removal is usually painful. Thus, moistening the gauze with warm 2% lidocaine that does not
 contain epinephrine makes removal more comfortable. In cats, moistening the gauze with warm physi-
ologic saline is indicated.
Basics of Bandaging, Casting. and Splinting 
For dry-to-dry dressings, dry gauze is placed in a wound that has low-viscosity exudate. The exudate
is absorbed and evaporates from the bandage, leaving the dressing adhered to the wound. Removal of
the dressing removes necrotic tissue. Moistering the gauze with warm 2% lidocaine makes removal more
comfortable. Moistening the gauze with warm physiologic saline should be done in cats.
These gauze dressings have several disadvantages: (1) Both healthy and unhealthy tissue are removed
at dressing change. (2) The dry environment does not favor the function of cells and proteases involved
in healing. (3) There is danger of exogenous bacteria wicking inward toward the wound with a wet gauze,
and if the dressing is maintained wet tissue maceration can occur. (4) Dry gauze can disperse bacteria into
the air at bandage change. (5) Fibers of the gauze can remain adhered to the wound to induce inflamma-
tion. (6) The adherent dressings are more painful to wear and to remove. (7) Removal of wound fluid with
the dressings removes cytokines and growth factors essential for optimal healing.
Hypertonic saline dressings These dressings are a good choice for infected or necrotic, heavily
exudative wounds that need aggressive debridement. Their 20% sodium chloride content gives them an
osmotic effect to draw fluid from the wound to decrease edema and thus enhance circulation. The osmotic
action also desiccates tissue and bacteria. These dressings are changed every one to two days until necrosis
and infection are under control. The debridement of this osmotic dressing is nonselective in that both
healthy and necrotic tissue are removed at dressing change. The dressings are used early in wound treat-

help maintain a moist environment, the dressing can be overlaid with a vapor-permeable polyurethane
sheet. However, if too much exudate is being produced in the presence of the dressing, it can be covered
with an absorptive foam dressing. Because it is so absorptive, it can dehydrate a wound as the healing
progresses and exudate decreases. If it is left in a wound too long, it dehydrates and hardens to form a

wounds that are moderately to highly exudative. If an occlusive cover is needed to hold them in place or
retain some moisture, they can be overlaid with a hydrocolloid dressing. At dressing change, the polymer
is removed by lavage.
It is important to observe the exudate level in wounds being treated with copolymer starch dressings.
If exudate levels become too low, the dressing adheres to the wound. This can result in tissue damage
when it is removed and inflammation if fragments of dressing are left in the wound.
Moisture-retentive dressings
Moisture-retentive dressings (MRDs) provide a warm, moist environment over a wound in which cell
proliferation and function are enhanced in the inflammatory and repair stages of healing. In addition,

the retained fluid provides a physiologic ratio of proteases, protease inhibitors, growth factors, and cyto-

 dressing should be considered initially if there is a great amount of necrosis, foreign debris, infection, and
exudate.
 The wound environment under an MRD provides several advantages in the progression of wound
 healing (table 1.2). There are disadvantages of MRDs in that retained fluid can cause maceration (softening
caused by trapped moisture) and excoriation (damage caused by excess proteolytic enzymes) of the peri-

exudative wounds. The foam dressings maintain a moist environment and support autolytic debridement.

periwound skin, and their transparency allows wound visualization. They are nonabsorptive and should
be used on wounds with no or minimal exudate. For instance, they are suited for dry necrotic eschars, or
shallow wounds, such as partial-thickness wounds like abrasions. They can also be used on wounds in
the advanced repair stage of healing where there is need for a moist environment to promote epitheliali-
zation. Another use of the films is as a cover over other contact layers to support moisture retention and
to provide a bacteria and waterproof cover
The films should not be used on wounds that have high levels of exudate, are infected, or have fragile

With this type of dressing, the cloudy white to yellow exudate that accumulates under the dressing
should not be interpreted as infection. It is just wound surface exudate. Infection will present as heat,
swelling, pain, and hyperemia of the surrounding tissues.
Hydrogel dressings Hydrogels are water-rich gel dressings that are in the form of a sheet or
an amorphorus hydrogel. Some hydrogels contain other medications that can be beneficial to wound
healing, such as acemannan, a wound healing stimulant, and metronidazole or silver sulfadiazine,
antimicrobials.
Because they donate moisture to a wound, the hydrogels can be used in wounds with an eschar or dry
Sssaap aaisnioooas juanaupeuou e yim pienaao aq ueo jaorpay a aael alepueq Arepuosas a lou
or vapor-permeable polyurethane foam. Some hydrogels have an impermeable covering as part of the
dressing. Conversely to donating fluid to wounds, some hydrogels are able to absorb considerable fluid
and can be used in exudative wounds. These dressings can also be used in necrotic wounds to provide a
moist environment to promote autolytic debridement and aid in granulation tissue formation.
 In noninfected full-thickmess wounds, the dressings are generally changed every three days. However,
if a hydrogel containing a wound healing stimulant or antimicrobial is being used, daily change may be
indicated to maintain their activity in the wound. With abrasions that have minimal exudate, hydrogels

with gentle saline irrigation.
Hydrocolloid dressings Hydrocolloid dressings are a combination of absorbent and elastomeric
components that interact with wound fluid to form a gel. Some dressings have an adhesive layer of
hydrocolloid that contacts the wound and a outer occlusive polyurethane film. The hydrocolloid adheres
to the periwound skin, and the dressing over the wound interacts with wound fluid to produce an occlu-

ciated with hydrogel dressings.
Although the dressings are available in a paste as well as granular and powdered form, they are gener-
ally used as the sheet form that provides a thermally insulated moist environment which is impermeable
to fluid, gas, and bacteria.
Hydrocolloids can be used in partial or full-thickness wounds with clean or necrotic bases, including
pressure wounds, minor bums, abrasions, or graft donor sites. They can be used in both the inflammatory
and repair stages of healing. In the inflammatory stage of healing they promote autolytic debridement.
However, their adherence to periwound skin may delay wound contraction. The dressings should not be
used in heavily infected wounds or wounds producing large amounts of exudate. The large amounts of
exudate can lead to maceration and excoriation of periwound skin.
For application, the skin around the wound should be clipped. The pad is warmed between the hands
and cut to be about 2cm larger than the wound. After removing the backing, it is placed over the wound.
The tacky nature of the dressing allows it to stick to the periwound skin. At about two to three days, the
dressing should be changed when it feels like a fluid-filled blister over the wound and before the underly-
ing gel leaks from around the edges. After removal of the dressing, the gel is lavaged or gently wiped
from the wound and periwound skin, respectively. Use of the dressing should be discontinued when the
wound is fully epithelialized.
Nonadherent semiocclusive dressings These dressings have a low absorptive capacity. They are
porous and allow fluid to move through them into the secondary bandage layer where it can evaporate.
This porosity could also allow exogenous bacteria to penetrate toward the wound.
8Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
These dressings can be either a wide mesh gauze impregnated with petrolatum or an absorbent material
encased in a perforated nonadherent material. Although they are classified as nonadherent, they are actu-
into the meshes and thus adhere to the wound, resulting in tissue damage when they are removed. With
the perforated nonadherent material, the pad can adhere to the wound when the wound dries and exudate
dries in the perforations. Granulation tissue and epithelium can also enter the perforations if they are
large enough.
 If the petrolatum-impregnated gauze is used in the repair stage of healing, it should be used in the

ence with epithelialization. Once epithelialization starts, the perforated nonadherent material with absor
bent filler should be used.
If the perforated nonadherent material with absorbent filler is used, its purpose is to retain some mois-
ture over the wound to promote epithelialization and allow excess fluid to be absorbed into the secondary
layer. It should be used on superficial wounds with low to moderate levels of exudate. They are often

for sutured wounds.
Antimicrobial dressings
Antimicrobial agents such as iodine, silver, polyhexamethylene biguanide, activated charcoal, and antibi-
otics have been incorporated into dressings. These dressings are indicated to treat infected wounds or
wounds at risk for infection. The dressings are not moisture retentive. Thus, covering them with a poly-
urethane film dressing may keep them from drying out.
Dressings containing cadexomer iodine release iodine into the wound without having a negative effect
on wound cells. The slow release of iodine is designed to maintain adequate levels of active iodine for
about 48 hours.
Silver ions in dressings have a broad antimicrobial effect and can be effective against otherwise antibiotic-

include gauze, gauze roll, low adherent, hydrocolloid, hydrogel, and alginate dressings.
 Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) is an antiseptic related to chlorhexidine. It has been incorpo-
rated in gauze sponges and roll gauze to provide an antimicrobial dressing. It is bactericidal, and bacteria
do not develop a resistance to this broad-spectrum compound. It is tissue compatible and does not have
any apparent effects on wound healing. The PHMB has a prolonged antibacterial effect; it prevents bacteria
 on the wound from contaminating the environment and stops exogenous bacteria from penetrating the
bandage.
Activated charcoal dressings provide a moist wound environment. They also absorb bacteria, prevent
 exuberant granulation tissue formation, and reduce wound odor.

at the site of placement, while serum levels remain below toxic levels. These dressings have also been
reported to have a hemostatic effect.
Extracellular matrix bioscaffold dressings
Extracellular matrix dressings (ECMs) are acellular biodegradable sheets with a three-dimensional
ultrastructure. They are derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa or porcine urinary bladder
submucosa matrix. The dressings contain structural proteins, growth factors, cytokines, and their inhibi-
tors. Over the first two weeks of its presence in a wound, there is degradation of the scaffold, with the
degradation products being chemotactic for repair cells. The repair cells enter the wound as stem cells
that deposit a site-specific matrix. In other words, if the dressing has been placed in a skin wound, the
matrix will be like that of skin/dermis. By 30 to 90 days, the entire bioscaffold is replaced by site-specific
tissue.

sheet is cut to a size slightly larger than the wound, rehydrated with saline, tucked beneath the skin at
the wound edge, and sutured in place. If drainage is expected, it can be fenestrated. A nonadhesive or
parts of the bandage are changed except the ECM. It will have a degenerated yellow to brown appearance.
A second piece of dressing is placed over this degenerating first piece without removing it. The outer
bandage is replaced with the next dressing change, four to seven days later. After two to three applications
of ECM dressing, no new dressings are added. Typically, a granulation tissue bed is present with the
presence of a site-specific matrix that will guide the healing of the wound with tissue like that in the sur-
rounding area. Wound management is continued with appropriate bandaging of the granulating wound
as healing progresses.
Secondary-intermediate layer
The main function of the secondary bandage layer is absorption. Thus, it should have good capillarity
properties to provide for the collection of blood, serum, exudate, debris, bacteria, and enzymes from the
wound. Additional functions of the secondary layer are to pad and protect the wound from trauma,
prevent movement, and hold the primary layer against the wound.
Materials that can be used for the secondary layer include specific loose-weave absorbent wrap materi-
als, cast padding, and absorbent bulk roll cotton. One author (SFS) prefers to use the first of these as the

This layer should be applied in a wrapping fashion with about 50% overlap of layers. When wrapping
with enough pressure to hold the primary layer in contact with the wound and to have good contact
between it and the primary layer. However, excessive compression when applying this layer should be
avoided since it could impair absorption, blood supply, and wound contraction.
The bandage should be changed frequently (at least daily) on heavily draining wounds to remove
exudate that has been absorbed into the secondary layer. Bandage change should be before exudate soaks
through to the tertiary layer. This could result in exogenous bacteria wicking inward toward the wound.
To help prevent this potential for wound contamination, antimicrobial gauze roll can be used as the sec-
ondary layer. When less fluid is absorbed into the secondary layer (e.g., with use of an MRD or as healing

Tertiary-outer layer
This layer's main function is to hold the other bandage layers in place and protect them from external
contamination. Materials that are used for this layer are porous surgical adhesive tape, occlusive water-
When applying this layer, certain factors should be kept in mind. First, the tertiary layer should be
applied under the proper tension. It should hold the primary layer in contact with the wound and the
secondary layer in contact with the primary layer
 Second, care should be taken that it is not applied too tightly. This can limit the absorption of the sec-
ondary layer. In addition, overtight application on the head and extremities can result in respiratory and
circulatory problems, respectively. To help prevent this, one author (SFS) applies porous surgical adhesive
tape and occlusive waterproof tape as pretorn strips, rather than rolling the tape directly off of the roll

too tightly, the tape is secured near the bandage with one hand while pulling it off of the roll. Another
guideline for applying the tape is to apply it so that the textured patterm of the tape is distorted but still
visible.

bandages on the thorax, abdomen, and limbs.
Special considerations in bandaging, casting, and splinting
Frequency of changes
With bandages, the frequency of bandage changes decreases as wound healing progresses. During the
early stages of healing when exudate production is greatest, wound observation is very important, and
strike-through prevention is necessary, frequent bandage change may be indicated. However, with MRDs
that support autolytic debridement, bandages may be left in place up to three days. Conversely, dressings
with high absorptive capacity (e.g., gauze) may need to be changed at least daily and possibly more often,
depending on the amount of exudate production.
 Once a healthy bed of granulation tissue is present and exudate levels are low, the time between
 bandage changes is expanded. With nonadherent simiocclusive dressings, the time may be extended to
three or four days. With some of the other MRDs, the time may be expanded to five to seven days between
bandage changes.
There are times when unscheduled bandage, cast, or splint changes are necessary. These include when
there has been slippage, strike-through, wemess, external contamination, and damage to the bandage,
cast, or splint. Odor, swelling, or hypothermia of tissues adjacent to the bandage (e.g., digits left exposed
from a limb/paw bandage) and constant licking or chewing at a bandage, cast, or splint are also indica-
tions for a change.
Security
 For a bandage, cast, or splint to be effective, it must be secured in place. Security is a challenge in that
animal conformation is quite variable (e.g., a chihuahua vs. a great dane), and tolerance of a bandage,
cast, or splint can vary between animals. In the following chapters, application of bandages, casts, and
splints will be covered to include techniques to help assure security of these applications. Based on the
above-mentioned variables, the veterinarian or veterinary technician may need to occasionally modify a
technique and use it in combination with some type of restraint to maintain a secure bandage, cast, or
splint. However, if a modification is done, an adage should be remembered: "First, do no harm." Sound
clinical judgment is important in applying bandages, casts, and splints.

Pressure relief
Prevention of pressure from bandages, casts, and splints is important from two standpoints. First, there
 must be prevention of pressure-induced injury from a bandage, cast, or splint being placed too tightly.
This is particularly important in placing bandages on extremities and the head, especially when elastic

Joint immobilization
Wounds over joints can have problems in healing due to joint movement. Thus, joint immobilization is
 indicated for optimal healing. Such immobilization is attained with a bandage, cast, or splint.

 is flexed (fig. 1.2). In a sutured wound, the tension of joint flexion could result in sutures pulling out of
tissues. Thus, wound immobilization is indicated.
With a large open wound on the flexion surface of a joint, open wound healing could result in wound
contraction ending in a wound contracture deformity, whereby the joint is pulled into a flexed position
and carmot be extended (fig. 1.3). Immobilizing the joint in extension may help prevent this deformity.

cover, but contracture deformity has been avoided.
Prolonged joint immobilization may lead to disuse atrophy, joint stiffness, pressure wounds, and car
tilage degeneration. At bandage changes, the clinician should not only care for the wound but also evalu-
ate joints for problems.

Maceration and excoriation
Maceration is basically overhydration of skin around a wound. It is caused by prolonged contact of the
skin with wound exudate. This compromises the skin's barrier function.
Excoriations are skin abrasions caused by high levels of matrix metalloproteinases (enzymes) in exudate
 of chronic wounds. These also compromise the barrier function of the skin.

and excoriation. To help prevent maceration and excoriation when using MRDs, the dressing can be cut
to the size and shape of the wound so that it does not overlap onto healthy surounding skin.
Need for sedation or anesthesia during bandage change
There are several ways to decrease the pain and discomfort associated with bandage changes. Autolytic
debridement with nonadherent MRDs is less painful than the mecharical debridement that occurs with
adherent wet-to-dry and dry-to-dry dressings. However, if the latter dressings are used, the last layer of
gauze in contact with the wound can be moistened with warm 2% lidocaine for a few minutes before it
is removed to provide comfort. In cats, warm physiologic saline is used for this purpose. To remove

management when staged debridement and lavage are being done. Although there may be additional
expense and risk with sedation, the animal is more tractable, wound management is accomplished better,
and there is less stress on the animal and personnel. General anesthesia may be needed for aggressive
surgical debridement and for bandage changes when a wound is painful or an animal is particularly
aggressive.
Basics of Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting

Casts and splints
General information
Cast and splints rely on many of the same materials and layers used in other types of bandages, with a
few exceptions. Generally, cast padding, gauze and various outer layers all provide the same purposes
and are used in the manner described for each casting and splinting procedure. Because casts and splints
may be in place for a prolonged period, and because they have an inflexible component, the need to
prevent pressure wounds is critical. However, paying close attention to avoiding wrinkles, pressure on
anatomic prominences, and motion within the cast or splint is also very important.
Purposes and functions of casts and splints
The materials that set a cast or splint aside from other bandages are those that provide a degree of rigidity.
The purpose may be to stabilize a fracture in order to allow boney union or merely to allow more com-
fortable transport of the animal. Splints and casts may protect surgical repairs or support soft tissue
injuries. The rigidity of a cast will exceed that of a splint, and an intact cast provides more support than
one that has been split ("bivalved") and then reapplied. The rigidity may be achieved through the use of
or other materials that are of suitable size and stiffness, such as thermomoldable plastic.
Materials
Splint rods
Splint rods are inexpensive, but they do not conform as well to the limbs as fiberglass tapes. They must
be cut and bent to shape. Care should be taken to assure thiat the cut ends do not injure the animal
Commercial splints
Commercial plastic and metal splints are available in a variety of sizes and shapes. Some will work better
spuena go Aaea e day ch isaq si h Kerana paau pue oneoi 'aned au uo upuadap srao u
and sizes on hand in order to determine which will work best for a given case. The metal splints (e.g.
Mason metasplints) can be cut with metal cutting shears to modify them if needed. Splints should be
applied after a basic bandage is applied (i.e., a bandage consisting of a contact layer, cast padding as
secondary bandage wrap, and gauze wrap) and then fixed to the limb with a nonelastic material such as
porous adhesive tape.
Plastic splinting material
Thermomoldable plastic materials are available for molding splints. These are heated in hot water and
are then manually molded to the conformation of the area being splinted. The materials can also be cut
with shears when they are in their heated state. When cooled, they return to a rigid state.
Stockinette
Placing stockinette beneath casting material is not absolutely necessary, but it seems to help provide some
degree of comfort in the authors opinion. When stockinette is applied longer than a cast, it can be folded
back onto the cast to roll a small amount of cast padding over the edge of the cast to create a soft "bumper'
thiat will protect the tissue from the sharp edge of the cast.
14  Small Animal Bandaging. Casting, and Splinting Techniques
Castingtapes
 Casting tapes can be used to make a custom splint or a full cast. Fiberglass tape is preferable to plaster
 because it is light, durable, and water resistant. However, plaster is inexpensive and sets more slowly and
at a lower temperature. When using fiberglass tape, care should be taken to avoid stretching the tape
during application because it will slowly return to its original length. In a splint application, this will
result in a splint that is too short. In a cast application, it will result in a cast that is too tight.

Head and Ear Bandages
Emergency ear bandage
Indications
The most common use of the emergency bandage is in hunting/working dogs that sustain a laceration
of the pinna from a thorm or barb on a barbed wire. By instinct, the dogs shake their head to try to rid
themselves of the irritation of the ear laceration. The head shaking further irritates and injures the pinna
and splatters blood on the dog's surroundings. The emergency ear bandage is indicated to immobilize
 the injured pinna against the dog's head to prevent further injury to the pinna and to prevent the dog
from splattering blood on its surroundings.
Technique
 A section of a leg from a pair of pantyhose
is cut such that it is the approximate length
of the dog's head. This can be kept in a first
aid kit to be taken to the field with the dog.
A section of orthopedic stockinette could
also be used.
●When it is indicated, the section of the
pantyhose leg can be pulled over the dog's
head to immobilize the ear against the head
(fig. 2.1).

16   Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
Aftercare
 If the dog persists in head shaking and the pantyhose segment tends to slip back, it may be necessary to
tape the front edge of the pantyhose segment circumferentially around the dog's head. A piece of 2-inch
(5cm)-wide adhesive tape is used. Half of the width of the tape goes on the hair / skin of the head and the
other half is on the front edge of the pantyhose.
Advantages and complications
The emergency ear bandage is small and easily carried in a field first aid kit. It is readily available and
quickly applied in the field. It provides protection for the ear until more definitive care can be administered
to the ear.
Basic head and ear bandage
Indications
 The basic head and ear bandage is indicated for protection of wounds in this area. This includes
wounds associated with correction of auricular hematomas, total ear canal ablation, trauma, or tumor
removal.
Technique
The following is a description of the technique for placing a head and ear bandage on a dog that has had
surgery on the pinna (e.g., auricular hematoma correction) and needs to have medication placed in the
ear canal. The same bandage would be used for treatment of other conditions, except that the aperture
for applying ear medication would not be cut.
To help assure adhesion of tape to the pinna
of the ear for applying "stirrups," both the
convex and concave sides of the pinna
should be shaved, scrubbed, and allowed to
dry.
"Stirrups" are placed on the rostral and
caudal edges of the ear. A strip of 2-inch
(5.0cm)-wide adhesive tape that is long
enough to wrap around the dog's head is
used. The strip is aligned parallel with the
long axis of the pinna along the rostral edge
of the ear on the concave surface of the ear,
with the adhesive surface against the ear.
One half of the width of tape is against the
Fg. 2.2.
ear (fig. 2.2).
Head and Ear Bandages 17
 The other half of the tape width is folded
over onto the convex surface of the rostral
edge of the ear. This sandwiches the rostral
edge of the ear between the two layers of
tape with the rostral edge of the ear in the
fold of the tape (fig. 2.3).
 The length of tape beyond the distal end of
the ear is folded over on itself to form a
1-inch (2.5cm)-wide "stirrup"
Fg. 2.3.
 This procedure is repeated on the caudal
edge of the ear to provide two "stirrups"
that will be used to hold the ear over the top
of the dog's head (fig. 2.4).
Fg. 2.4.
A bolus of cotton or a thick pad of cast
padding is placed on top of the dog's head
at the base of the ear (fig. 2.5).
Fg. 2.5.
18  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
 The two "stirrups" are used to pull the
pinna up and fold it over the bolus/pad.
The "stirrups" are wrapped around the
 dog's head (curved arrows) and pulled up
 in front and in back of the ear that is being
bandaged (straight arrows). This leaves the
opening of the ear canal open. If auricular
hematoma correction surgery has been
done, the incision line is between the
"stirrup's"attachment on the pinna (dark
line; fig. 2.6).
Fg. 2.6.
● An appropriate primary dressing is placed
over the incision site (d; fig. 2.7).
Fg.2.7.
●A roll of secondary bandage wrap is used to
wrap the dog's head circumferentially. Each
time the wrap goes over the ear canal
opening, the location of the opening is
marked with a marking pen (fig. 2.8).
Fg. 2.8.
Head and Ear Bandages 19
 Each time a wrap is made with the second-
 ary wrap, it alternately goes in front and in
back of the contralateral ear (unoperated
ear). When the secondary wrap is com-
pleted, the location of the ear canal has been
marked (black spot) and the opposite ear is
outside of the bandage (being held up;
fig. 2.9).
Fg. 2.9.
Pretorn strips of 2-inch (5.0 cm)-wide adhe-
sive tape are placed circumferentially over
the secondary wrap (fig. 2.10), and the loca-
tion of the ear canal opening is marked on
the strip that goes over this area (fig. 2.11).
Fg. 2.10.
Fg. 2.11.
 20  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
A very important strip of tape is placed at
the front edge of the bandage. It is placed
such that half of the tape's width is on the
hair/skin of the head and half is on the
bandage (fig. 2.12).
●
 A similar piece of tape can be placed at the
back edge of the bandage to further secure
it and keep it from slipping forward, espe-
cially on an obese dog with a large neck.
Fg. 2.12.
After placing this last tape strip, a hand is
placed over the strip for approximately one
minute. The heat of the dog's body and the
heat of the hand help make the tape's adhe-
sive material adhere to the skin/hair for
bandage security (fig. 2.13). On small dogs
and cats, the distance between the lateral
canthus of the eye and base of the ear is
short. Thus, use of 1-inch (2.5 cm)-wide tape
to fashion the front portion of the bandage
may be necessary.
Fg. 2.13.

A marker is used to draw a square around
the dot marking the location of the ear

 Each edge of the square is taped with a strip
?
 of 1-inch (2.5cm)-wide adhesive tape to
 prevent lint/pieces of secondary wrap from
getting into the ear canal (fig. 2.17). It is
 obvious that the ear is bandaged over the
top of the dog's head when an opening has
been made over the opening of the ear
canal—an important factor during bandage
removal.
Fg. 2.17.
The following is a description of the technique for placing a head and ear bandage on a dog that will
not need to have medication placed in the ear canal. Examples would be bandaging the ear over the top
 of the head, as would be done for a total ear canal ablation surgery, or bandaging the ear down alongside
the dog's head, as with bandaging for a wound on top of the dog's head.
When bandaging the ear over the top of the
head, the technique for placing the head and
ear bandage is as described above, with the
exception that marking the location of the
ear canal opening on the secondary and ter-
tiary bandage layers and cutting an access
hole to this area are not done.

placed as described above. However, the
location of the ear canal opening is not
 marked as these layers are applied.

 of otitis externa is associated with the condition, medication can be administered to the ear canal by way
of the hole in the bandage over the opening to the ear canal.
At about seven days, the bandage is removed. This is done carefully so as to avoid cutting into the ear
that is bandaged over the top of the head. Thus, cutting the bandage with bandage scissors should be
done on the ventral aspect of the bandage (fig. 2.19), and it should be done carefully so as to leave the
'stirrups" intact (fig. 2.20).

than auricular hematoma. However, appropriate treatment of head and ear wounds is done before
bandage replacement.

the endotracheal tube is removed, the tight bandage collapses the upper airway, resulting in respiratory
embarrassment. Thus, the dog should be observed closely after the endotracheal tube is removed to assure
there is no occlusion of the airway, especially if an elastic bandage material was used for the tertiary layer
Advantages and complications
Head and ear bandages provide good protection for wounds of the head and ears. However, if the front
edge of the bandage is not adequately affixed to the hair of the head, the bandage can slip. A dog's first
response to the bandage is to try to shake its head and rid itself of the bandage. When this fails, it will

sutured wounds or open wounds. For sutured wounds, the bandage provides protection of the area from
 contamination and molestation by the animal. When bandaging an open wound, the bandage not only
provides wound protection, but the primary bandage layer can also provide a stimulating effect on the
wound healing process. These bandages are especially useful for large wounds over the thoracic and
abdominal areas, such as burm wounds.
A basic thoracic and abdominal bandage is also part of using aluminum splint rod side braces (see Side
Braces in chapter 5). The bandage is applied prior to placing the side splints. Thus, when the extensions
of the side splints are taped in place, they are taped to the bandage and the circumferential body tape
Wraps are not applied to the hair on the trunk. This makes the presence of the splints more comfortable
for the dog.
Technique
 When it is indicated (i.e., treating a thoracic
or abdominal wound), the appropriate
primary bandage layer is placed over the
wound.
● Using an absorbent secondary bandage
 wrap material, the thoracic and abdominal
 areas are wrapped circumferentially start-
 ing on the thorax just behind the forelimbs
(fig. 3.2).
Fig. 3.2.
●After several wraps, the bandage wrapping
material is taken up between the forelimbs

 region and up across the opposite shoulder
 area back onto the front of the body bandage
(fig. 3.4 [arrow]). This is done at least two
times to give layers of the bandage material
 across the pectoral area as a strap.
Fig. 3.4.
 This procedure of placing a strap of bandage
wrap is repeated on the opposite side. This
provides two straps (A and B) of bandage
across the pectoral and lower cervical areas
thiat serve as shoulder straps to secure the
bandage in place (fig. 3.5).
Fg. 3.5.
● After the two straps have been placed, the
wrapping of the secondary bandage wrap is
continued back onto the abdominal area.
Each wrap overlaps the width of the previ-
 ous wrap by one-half to one-third. Wrapping
goes to just in front of the hind limbs. On
male dogs, this goes to just in front of the
prepuce (fig. 3.6). Two to three layers of
wrap are made to cover the thoracic and
abdominal areas.
Fig. 3.6.
 28  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques 
 Starting just behind the front limbs, pretorn
 strips of 2-inch (5.0cm)-wide adhesive tape
are placed circumferentially around the
trunk to cover the secondary wrap (fig. 3.7).
Each strip of tape overlaps the previous
strip by one-half to one-third of its width.
Alternatively, elastic bandage wrap can be
used for this layer.
Fg. 3.7.
●Pretorn strips of 2-inch (5.0cm)-wide adhe-
sive tape are placed over the two straps
across the pectoral and lower cervical
region. The strips are long enough so that
the ends adhere to the body bandage (fig.
3.8). If elastic bandage wrap is used as the
tertiary layer, it is used to create the two
straps. The completed bandage provides
cover for thoracic or abdominal wounds or
Fg. 3.8.
a bandage surface along which the exten-
sions of side splints can be taped (fig. 3.9).
 To conserve on bandage material, a window
can be cut in the bandage over the wound
area, and a bandage is placed over this win-
dowed area. This bandage is held in place
by tape fixation to the body bandage. Thus,
at bandage change, only the bandage cover-
ing the wound is changed and the body
bandage is left in place unless it has become
wet or soiled, in which case it is changed
(see page 36 this chapter, Pelvic Bandages,
Windowed Pelvic Bandage).

length of the torso section, and the bandage is removed. The wound is treated and the bandage is replaced.
If a windowed bandage is used, the wound is treated through the window and a small bandage is replaced
over the window.
 The cranial surface of the elbow area should be observed for any irritation that the two shoulder straps
might be causing in the area. If this is noticed, a length of gauze can be passed from side to side under
the straps and tied. This pulls the straps together and up away from the front of the elbow area.
 On male dogs, the preputial area should be observed to check for any skin irritation that the caudal
bandage edge may be causing in this area.
Advantages and complications
The bandage provides good coverage for thoracic and abdominal wounds or a good surface on which to
fix the extensions of side splints. The shoulder straps provide security and keep the bandage from slipping
caudally. If the windowed version of the bandage is used, it conserves on bandage materials since only
the portion of the bandage over the wound is changed.
The complication of this bandage is the skin irritation that can be caused by the shoulder straps and
the caudal edge of the bandage in the bend of the elbow area and the preputial area on males,
respectively.
 If a windowed bandage is used, the bandage around the window can become wet and be a source for
bacterial growth if wound lavage is used in wound care. Thus, care must be used in cleaning the wound
surface.

an open wound.
A potential complication of the tie-over bandage is that the suture loops could cut into the skin if the
placing tape or some form of impermeable material over the bandage reduces chances of this
complication.
Pelvic bandages
 Circumferential pelvic bandage
Indications
The circumferential pelvic bandage is indicated to provide covering for wounds on the pelvic area or
wounds over the caudal lumbar and sacral areas (fig. 3.15). These could be sutured wounds or open
wounds. The bandage provides protection of the area from contamination and molestation by the animal.
When bandaging an open wound, the primary bandage layer can also fumish a stimulating effect on the

EE
Technique
 The appropriate primary bandage material
is placed over the wound.
 Using an absorbent secondary bandage
wrap material, the abdominal area 
is
wrapped  circumferentially
ywithseveral
layers (fig. 3.16). On male dogs, bandage
material is initially wrapped over the
prepuce.
Fig. 3.16.
 Wrapping  is continued circumferentially
 around the proximal aspect of one pelvic
limb for two to three wraps (fig. 3.17).
Fig. 3.17.
The wrapping goes back onto the caudal
abdominal portion of the bandage for one to
two wraps.
Wrapping is then taken to the proximal
 aspect of the opposite pelvic limb where
 two to three layers of circumferential wrap
are made, as with the first limb. On intact
male dogs the scrotum should be avoided
when wrapping the proximal limbs. The
 result is a bandage that covers the abdomi-
 nal, pelvic, and caudal spinal areas, leaving
the tail, anus, vulva, or scrotum uncovered
(fig. 3.18).
Fig. 3.18.
 34  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
Pretorn strips of 2-inch (5.0cm)-wide

Alternatively, elastic bandage wrap can be
used for this layer.

Pelvic extension splints
Indications
 Dogs that have had spinal trauma may assume a Schiff-Sherrington posture. They are in a sitting position
with the forelimbs extended and supporting the dog's forequarters while the pelvic limbs are extended
forward under the dog (fig. 3.31). Thus, the dog's weight is borne on the ischial tuberosities. With side
splints that extend beyond the pelvic area, pressure goes on the ends of the splints, keeping it off of the
skin over the ischial tuberosities and preventing decubital ulcer formation. The splints are designed for
and work best on small dogs (fig. 3.32).

Tail bandages
Indications
Tail bandages are indicated when there has been an injury to the tail and the wound is being treated as
an open wound, a sutured wound, or occasionally as a grafted wound. Bandages provide wound protec-
tion and/or protection from pressure on a tail stump.
A common wound of the tail occurs in long-tailed, short-haired dogs that are housed in a kennel envi-
ronment. When the dog wags its tail, the tip becomes traumatized as it hits against cage or kennel run
walls. The result is an open wound on the tip of the tail. A secure bandage is indicated to protect the tail
tip while it heals
When a tail has been amputated at a level such that a bandage can be applied to the remaining stump,
a secure bandage is indicated. If the tip of the stump might be traumatized as the animal sits, a splint
may be needed to protect the tip of the tail as it heals.
If a tail has been amputated so short that a bandage and /or splint cannot be applied to the stump, side
splints may be indicated to protect the stump to prevent molestation and trauma when the animal assumes
a sitting posture (see page 39, chapter 3, Pelvic Extension Splints).

 Bandage scissors will be needed to remove the bandage. The "stirrups" and "shingling" technique
provides a secure bandage. Thus, removal may require some dilligence.
 Because of this, some analgesic/sedation may be needed when manipulating an injured tail to remove

bandages is that they can be wagged off, that is, with the centrifugal force of tail wagging, the bandage
tends to be thrown off of the tail. "Stirrups" and "shingling" help prevent this.
Because the circulation of the tail becomes more tenuous as the tip of the tail is approached, circulatory
compromise could occur if the circumferential tape wraps are placed too tight. To help avoid this, pretorn
tape strips are used for these wraps. The danger of getting the wraps too tight is greater if the tape is
rolled off of the roll and onto the tail.
Forelimb bandages, casts, and splints
There is some overlap of information about the basic soft padded limb bandage and the basic paw and
distal limb bandage. However, some areas require information specific to them. Therefore, to make cover-
age easier for the reader and thus avoid refering back to areas, a section has been devoted to each topic.
Generally, information on the basic soft padded bandage will refer to injuries above the carpus or tarsus,
and basic paw and distal limb bandages will refer to injuries from the carpus or tarsus distally. Thus, the
reader should refer to both sections if there is concern about what technique to use based on location of
an injury.
Basic soft padded limb bandage
This information for the basic soft padded limb bandage on the forelimb also applies to the pelvic limb
(see page 92 this chapter, Pelvic Limb Bandages, Casts, and Splints; Basic Soft Padded Limb Bandage).

● If the bandage is to be used for covering a
 wound or wound repair area, the appropri-
 ate medication and primary bandage layer
are placed over the wound.
 Cast padding is applied by wrapping the
 limb from distal to proximal, starting at the
digits (figs. 4.21, 4.22). The width of cast
padding used is dependent on the size of
the animal. Effort should be made to overlap
 each turn around the limb approximately
Fg. 4.21.
fifty percent over the preceding turn.
Additionally, wrinkles should be avoided,
and the material should be stretched to
slightly distort the pillow texture if a tex-
 tured type of cast padding is used. Concern
about getting cast padding wrapped too
tightly is not a factor since it will tear if too
much tension is placed on it.
 If the bandage is being used to cover a
draining wound, an absorbent secondary
wrap designed to absorb wound fluid is
preferred to cast padding. The wrap is
 applied in the same manner as described for
 cast padding; however, care must be taken
not to wrap it too tightly because it will not
tear if excess tension is applied.
Fg. 4.22.
 At the proximal end of the bandage, tension
is evenly applied across the roll of cast
padding to tear the roll of padding.
Additional layers are commonly applied
(figs. 4.23, 4.24).
 When treating a draining wound, several
layers of absorbent secondary wrap are
applied to absorb wound fluid. The wrap
material is cut after sufficient layers have
been applied, usually three to four layers.
Fg. 4.23.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints  53
Fig. 4.24.
The next layer is roll gauze, which is applied
from distal to proximal starting at the digits.
There should be fifty percent overlap of
each wrap with the previous wraps. The
 gauze should begin and terminate such that
 a small amount of underlying cast padding
protrudes from under it at the top and
bottom of the bandage. It is important to
apply even tension across the roll during
 application by keeping fingers on the roll
and not on the extended portion of the
gauze (fig. 4.25). Tension is applied to
supply mild compression of the underlying
cast padding. However, excess tension
should be avoided because it could inhibit
venous and lymphatic return from the limb.
When the bandage is being used to treat a
Fig.4.25.
draining wound, this layer of roll gauze is
not used.
The tape strips of the "stirrups" are sepa-
 rated. Each one is twisted so the adhesive
side will be against the bandage. They are
then folded up onto the bandage. The
middle two digits should be visible (fig.
4.26).
Fig. 4.26.
54   Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
●The final protective layer can be applied
with elastic wrap bandage material. It is
applied from distal to proximal with fifty
percent overlap of each wrap with the previ-
 q  ou p d s
Fg. 4.27.
(fig. 4.27). It is applied with moderate
tension such that the textured pattern of the
material is slightly distorted but still visible.
There are factors that govern the amount of
pressure within an elastic tape outer wrap
(see page 56 this chapter, Basic Paw and
Distal Limb Bandage). A small amount of
 the underlying layer should protrude at the
top and bottom of the bandage (fig. 4.28).
Fg. 4.28.
Alternatively, porous adhesive tape can be used for the outer layer of the bandage. Strips of tape are

circumferentially. The strips are applied from distal to proximal with mild but not constrictive pressure
with fifty percent overlap of strips.
Aftercare
The bandage should be carefully monitored. It should be kept clean and dry, and the animal should not
be allowed to lick or chew at it. The two exposed digits should be examined for signs of swelling (separa-
tion of the digits), which would indicate the bandage is too tight and needs to be changed. A veterinarian
should be contacted if the animal's use of the limb decreases or if any of the above signs are noticed.
If the bandage has been used for treating a draining wound, periodic bandage changes will be
necessary.
Bandage remova!
The bandage should be removed in layers to provide comfort for the animal. The following is the removal
technique for a bandage covering a wound. Some of the steps will apply to removing a bandage that
underlies a cast or splint being used for orthopedic treatment.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints  55
A razor, scalpel blade, or scissors should be used to carefully cut only the tertiary bandage layer for
the length of the bandage.
 The tertiary bandage layer is then removed by peeling it away from the underlying layer. If porous
adhesive tape was used for the tertiary layer, bandage scissors will be needed to snip the attachment
between the two layers.
●An end of the secondary layer is found or created and the secondary layer is unwrapped from the
 limb. The amount of exudate in the layer should become less with each bandage change as healing
progresses. If "stirrups" are present, the position against the skin can be left intact and subsequent
"stirrups" applied on top.
 Cotton, cast padding, or primary dressing pieces in the interpad and interdigital areas are removed if
they are wet or soiled.
 The primary bandage layer is removed and the wound area is treated appropriately (e.g., debrided,
lavaged, medicated). If the primary layer is adhered to the wound surface, it can be soaked with warm
physiologic saline or warm 2% lidocaine that does not contain epinephrine. Physiologic saline should
be used on cats. This loosens the bandage for removal and provides comfort for the animal.
The layered removal of the bandage is much more comfortable for the animal than trying to manipulate
the injured limb and bandage scissors with force to cut through all layers of the bandage at one time.
Bandage replacement
●The pieces of cotton or castpadding are replaced in theinterdigital and interpad area if they wereremoved.
 Depending on the nature of the wound, the appropriate bandage material is replaced over the wound
or graft.
 Donut pads can be saved from the previous bandage and be replaced in the new bandage. After two
to three uses, these pads become compressed and need to be replaced with new pads.
If the "stirrups" have become wet with wound drainage, they are replaced.

the tertiary layer (strike-through), especially if a porous tertiary layer has been used. If the tertiary
layer becomes wet, exogenous bacteria can contaminate the wound. Bandage changes can become less
frequent as healing progresses and fluid production decreases.
 The tertiary layer is replaced using either elastic bandage wrap or porous adhesive tape. To help keep
the tertiary bandage layers dry and clean, a plastic bag (e.g., bread sack or IV fluid bag) can be placed
over the bandage when the animal is in a wet or potentially contaminating environment. Rubber bands
should rot be used to affix the plastic bag on the limb. Tape should be used to secure the bag to the
hair above the bandage. Thus, the possibility of the rubber band slipping off of the bag and going
umoticed up under the hair to cause circumferential damage is avoided.
Advantages and complications
The soft padded bandage is easy to apply, and it provides appropriate support and protection for a variety

Primary bandage layer
The advantages and complications associated with the various primary bandage materials are covered in
 chapter I, Basics of Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting. In general, the newer primary dressing materials
enhance the healing process by creating an environment that supports wound healing or by interacting
with tissues to enhance healing. The donut pads provide an inexpensive way to protect the skin over
convex prominences from pressure injury. The "stirrups" help assure security of the bandage on the limb.
However, if they become wet, they may become a source of bacterial growth and wound
contamination.
Secondarybandagelayer
The absorption of exudate and its associated bacteria away from the wound is the main advantage of the
secondary bandage layer. The secondary layer also provides padding and some immobilization of
injuries.
When a porous tertiary layer has been used, fluid can evaporate from the exudate, and this helps
imhibit bacterial growth. The 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide-impregnated secondary dressing
 has the added advantage of inhibiting wound bacteria and exogenous bacteria that may enter the second-
ary layer.
With highly productive wounds, evaporation of fluid from the secondary layer may not be as fast as
frequent bandage changes are indicated.
 If cotton or cast padding is used in the secondary layer, and if they come in contact with the wounds
and become wet, they may stick to the wound. They are difficult to see and thus small amounts are left
 on the wound and can act as foreign bodies. However, cast padding has an advantage as a secondary
layer in that it is difficult to wrap it too tightly. It will tear if too much tension is placed on it while wrap-
ping it.
Tertiarybandagelayer
This layer holds the other layers in place. If a porous material is used, it allws evaporation of fluid from
the secondary layer, which is beneficial in keeping a bandage dry. However, the porosity also can allow
exogenous fluid and bacteria to enter the bandage. Elastic bandage materials provide good conformation
of the bandage to the limb, but they have the potential complication that they can cause circulatory prob-

Secondary bandage layer
The function of the secondary bandage layer is to provide absorption of wound drainage, padding, and
 some immobilization. Specific secondary wraps or cast padding can be used (see chapter 1).
 The secondary bandage layer is wrapped
onto the limb from distal to proximal. It
should be wrapped such that there is good
contact between this layer and the underly-
ing primary bandage. However, excess
 pressure should be avoided. This layer is
placed evenly along the limb. The practice

Tertiarybandagelayer
This layer secures the other bandage components in place, keeps them clean, and helps immobilize the
bandaged distal limb, especially when the layer holds a splint in place. Several materials are available for
this layer (see chapter 1).
● Tertiary bandage material is placed over the
secondary layer.
Option 1—If porous adhesive tape is used,
strips of tape are pretorn before applying
them to the bandage (fig. 4.48). Each strip
 is long enough to go around the bandage
circumferentially.Strips oftape are
applied from distal to proximal on the
bandage, with mild but not constrictive
pressure in an overlapping fashion.

Distal Limb injuries, published by
Teton New Media (in press).
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints 
65
 Alternatively, the tape can be rolled off of
the roll as it is applied to the bandage.
However in doing this, it is necessary to
secure the tape near the bandage with one
hand while pulling more tape off of the roll.
Thus, the danger of applying tape too tightly
is reduced (fig. 4.49).

the other half of its width is on the skin at

Fg. 4.50.
 Additional pieces of tape can be placed to incorporate more skin/hair on the limb at the proximal end
of the bandage and thus prevent bandage slippage. A hand can be pressed on the tape over the skin/
hair for approximately one minute. The heat of the hand and the animal's body help make the tape's
 adhesive material adhere to the skin/hair for bandage security.
 Another means to help ensure tape adhesion to the skin is to spray polymeric solution of hexameth-
yldisiloxane acrylate (Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film, 3M Health Care, St. Paul, MN) on the skin adja-
cent to the top of the bandage. After drying, it leaves a clear film to which the tape sticks better than
omnly the skin. This film also helps prevent epidermal stripping when the tape is removed.
Option 2—When waterproof tape is used to protect the bandage from exogenous fluid (e.g., water or
urine), it is applied as pretorn strips as described for porous adhesive tape (fig. 4.48). However, it
is applied over the porous adhesive tape. Contact of this bandage material with skin and hair on
the limb is avoided. Bandage security to the skin and hair is assured by the medical-grade porous
adhesivetape.
 66  Small Animal  Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
Option 3—When elastic adhesive tape is applied, it should be done carefully over adequate secondary
bandage wrap to provide even but not excessive pressure. Use of cast padding as the secondary layer
applied off of the roll, it is secured near the bandage with one hand while pulling more tape off of
the roll. Thus, the danger of applying tape too tightly is reduced (fig. 4.49). The wraps should overlap
one-third to one-half of the tape width. Another guideline for applying this tape is to apply it such
that the textured pattern of the material is slightly distorted but still visible.

2.
 The amount of tension placed on the tape during application.
3.

4.
 The number and amount of overlap of layers applied. Pressure is additive with these, that is, each
layer may feel as if it is being applied under the correct tension. However, the pressure increases 
with each layer.
5.
 The circumference of the bandaged limb. The smaller the circumference, the greater will be the
possible pressure (fig. 4.51).
Care should be used when progressing from an area of smaller circumference to one of larger circum-
ference, that is, distal to proximal. The distal portion of the bandage should be applied with less tension
to prevent excessive constriction in this smaller circumference area. It should be remembered that there
may be some areas that are narrower than more distal areas on some dogs, for example, immediately
proximal to the carpus and tarsus and proximal to the digits. A tourniquet effect could result from tight
application in these areas. Adequate padding is important in helping prevent such pressure problems.
 If very convex areas (e.g., point of the hock or point of the elbow) are bandaged with elastic adhesive
tape, care needs to be taken to avoid too much pressure. Bandages over these areas normally produce
With placement of additional padding over these areas, pressure increases rather than decreases. Thus, it
is best to pad around these points with a "donut" pad (see page 58, this chapter, Primary Bandage Layer
"Donut" Pads, and "Stirrups").
To help assess the pressure of a distal limb bandage applied with elastic adhesive tape, the bandage
could be applied leaving the middle two digits exposed to be monitored for sensation and circulation

Aftercare
Bandage removal
A distal limb and paw bandage should be removed in layers to provide comfort for the animal. The fol-
lowing is the removal technique for a bandage covering a wound. Some of the steps will apply to removing
a bandage that underlies a cast or splint being used for orthopedic treatment.
 Using a razor blade or a scalpel blade, only the tertiary layer of the bandage is carefully incised along
the length of the bandage.
●At the proximal end of the bandage, where tape of the tertiary layer may be adhered to the skin and
● The tertiary bandage layer is then removed by peeling it away from the underlying secondary bandage
layer. Bandage scissors are used to snip the attachment between the two layers as it is needed.
●An end of the secondary layer is found or created and the secondary layer is unwrapped from the
limb. The amount of exudate being produced by the wound can be assessed as this layer is removed.
The amount of exudate in this layer should become less with each bandage change as healing pro-

they are wet or soiled.
● The primary bandage layer is removed and the wound area is treated appropriately (e.g., debrided,
lavaged, medicated). If the primary layer is adhered to the wound surface, it can be soaked with warm
physiologic saline or warm 2% lidocaine that does not contain epinephrine. For cats, warm physiologic
saline should be used. This loosens the bandage for removal and provides comfort for the animal at
removal.
The layered removal of the bandage is much more comfortable for the animal than trying to manipulate
the injured limb and bandage scissors with force to cut through all the layers of the bandage at once.
Bandage replacement
●At the time of bandage change, the pieces of cotton or cast padding that have been placed in the
interdigital and interpad areas are replaced. If wounds are present in these areas, then pieces of the
 appropriate primary bandage material are replaced in these areas.
 Depending on the nature of the wound, the appropriate bandage material is replaced over the wound
or graft. Diapering the paw may be done if it is indicated, that is, for a wound on the dorsum or
palmar/plantar paw surface of the medium-sized dog.

bandage. After two to three uses, these pads become compressed and need to be replaced with
new pads.
 If "stirrups" have been used, these are left in place and used in the new bandage. If the "stirrups"
have become wet with wound drainage fluid, they should be removed since this would be an area of
bacterial growth. The "stirrups" can be replaced or the bandage can be applied without "stirrups". In
the latter case, bandage security is dependent on tape fixation to the skin and hair at the proximal end
of the bandage.
 The secondary bandage layer is replaced. The amount of exudate being produced will govern the
frequency of bandage changes. In the early stages of wound management, when wound fluid produc-

The tertiary bandage layer is replaced using either elastic bandage wrap or porous adhesive tape. The
tertiary bandage layer should be kept dry and clean. When a porous tertiary layer has been used,
a plastic bag (e.g., bread sack, IV fluid bag) can be placed over the bandage when the animal is
in a wet or potentially contaminating environment, such as being outdoors for bowel and urinary
functions in wet grass. Rubber bands should not be used to affix the plastic bag on the limb. Tape
should be used to secure the bag to the hair above the bandage. Thus, the possibility of the rubber
band slipping off of the bag and going urnoticed up under the hair to cause circumferential damage
is avoided.

Interdigital/interpad area
The pieces of cotton or cast padding placed in these areas help absorb normal as well as exudative mois-
ture to help prevent tissue maceration and bacterial growth in these areas. With wounds in these areas,
the strips of primary bandage material can enhance the healing process.
Primarybandagelayer
The advantages and complications associated with the various primary bandage materials are covered in
chapter I. In general, the newer dressing materials enhance the healing process by creating an environment
that supports wound healing or by interacting with tissues to enhance healing.
Diapering a paw provides a smooth application of a nonadherent semiocclusive pad to the paw of a
medium-sized dog if this is the type of dressing that is indicated for the wound.
Donut pads made from cast padding provide an inexpensive way to provide protection for the skin
over convex prominences from pressure.
"Stirrups" help assure security of a bandage on the limb. However, if they become wet, they are a source
of bacterial growth and wound contamination.
Secondary bandage layer
The absorption of exudate and its associated bacteria away from the wound is the main advantage of
the secondary bandage layer. The secondary layer also provides padding and some immobilization of
injuries.
When a porous tertiary layer has been used, fluid can evaporate from the exudate, and this helps inhibit
bacterial growth. The 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide-impregnated secondary dressing has the added
advantage of inhibiting wound bacteria and exogenous bacteria that may enter the secondary layer.
With highly productive wounds, evaporation of fluid from the secondary layer may not be as fast as
absorption. Thus, wound bacteria and exogenous bacteria may proliferate in the bandage. In such wounds,
frequent bandage changes are indicated.
If cotton or cast padding is used in the secondary layer, and if they come in contact with the wound
and become wet, they may stick to the wound. They are difficult to see and thus small amounts are left
on the wound and can act as foreign bodies. However, cast padding has an advantage as a secondary
layer in that it is difficult to wrap it too tightly. It will tear if too much tension is placed on it while wrap

Tertiary bandage layer
This layer holds the other layers in place. If a porous material is used, it allows evaporation of fluid from
 the secondary layer, which is beneficial in keeping a bandage dry. However, the porosity also can allow
exogenous fluid and bacteria to enter the bandage. Elastic bandage materials provide good conformation
of the bandage to the limb, but they have the potential complication that they can cause circulatory prob-
lems and tissue necrosis if they are applied too tightly.
Paw pad pressure relief
Indications
Wounds of the digital and metacarpal/metatarsal pads can be lacerations, abrasions, punctures, burns
(thermal or chemical), or result from tumor removal. Such wounds have special requirements for adequate
healing. Pressure and movement of pad tissues must be minimized or prevented. Since pads act as shock
absorbers, weight bearing on the pads results in tissues of a wound moving apart as pressure is applied
or in sutures tearing through tissue if the wound has been sutured. This impedes healing. Thus, techniques
are necessary to relieve pressure in bandaging whether the wound is a simple laceration or a more com-
plicated pad graft. Some specific indications will be stated with portions of the Technique sections
Technique-moderate wounds on small to medium-sized dogs
Metacarpal/metatarsal pad

present. With the donut pad for metacarpal/metatarsal pad of-loading, the principle is that of distribut-
ing pressure on tissues around the wound rather than on the wound (fig. 4.55, A). With the triangular
pad placed under the metacarpal/metatarsal pad, the off-loading principle is that of elevating the digits 
by placing padding under the metacarpal/metatarsal pad (fig. 4.55, B). A complication that may be associ-
ated with the triangular foam sponge pad is that it may slip out of place as the animal puts weight on

placed on opposite sides of the bandage. On
the forelimb the splints should extend to
near the elbow. On the hind limb they
should extend to near the hock. The splints
are usually placed on the cranial and volar/
plantar bandage surfaces. However, they
could be placed on the medial and lateral
surfaces. The medial-lateral placement of
the splints is primarily indicated on the
pelvic limb where splints are placed below
the hock. The medial-lateral placement
helps avoid the skin irritation that can be
caused by the top of the cranial splint as it
presses against the skin on the cranial/
flexor aspect of the hock. An alternative to
medial-lateral splint placement is use of a
H-auo aas) pds _,as, -a
"Clamshell" Splint, below). For a large dog,
 medial-lateral placement will give more
support/stability. The splints are placed
with the paw cups facing each other and
 extending approximately 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5
to 3.8cm) beyond the paw (fig. 4.56A).
 The splints are taped in place with strips of
2-inch (5.0cm)-wide adhesive tape (fig.
4.56B). It is important that adhesive tape be
used for the tertiary bandage layer and to
tape the splints in place. The adhesion of the
tape of these two layers between the splints
provides security of the splints so they do
not slip dorsally with weight bearing.
Some form of padding, such as two or three
gauze sponges, should be taped over the
ends of the paw cups to protect them from
abrasion and to protect the clients' floors

When changing the bandage/splint on a forelimb that has a "clamshell" splint on it, the status of the

When "clamshell" splints are being used on the pelvic limb, the cranial/flexor surface of the tarsal area
should be observed for evidence of pressure injury caused by the proximal edge of the cranial splint. If
this can be used. If it is thought that full "clamshel" support is needed, such as for a large dog, then
splints can be placed in medial and lateral locations.

Dorsal paw pressure relief
Indications
A stockinette padding bandage can be used for temporary padding and coverage of the paws in small
dogs and cats. This covering is indicated to prevent abrasive and pressure-type lesions that result from

with time, that is, a neuropraxic nerve lesion (fig. 4.58). Other types of commercial splints and braces are
available. However, the author (SFS) has found this bandage to work nicely on small dogs and cats.
Fg. 4.58. An example of a dorsal paw pressure/abrasive lesion on which a dorsal paw pressure relief bandage would be
indicated.From Small Animal Distal Limb Injuries, Teton New Media.
Technique
●A length of 2-inch (5.0 cm)-diameter cotton
or synthetic orthopedic stockinette that is
used to line casts is placed on the distal limb
extending from the proximal metacarpal/
metatarsal level to beyond the digits. The
stockinette is cut 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5.0 cm)
beyond the ends of the digits (fig. 4.59).
Fg. 4.59. From Smaff Animaf Distat Limb injuries, published by
Teton New Media (in press).
●The distal end of the stockinette is folded
back onto the paw. The stockinette is folded
dorsally if the lesion is on the dorsum of the
paw or ventrally if the lesion is on the
palmar/plantar paw surface (fig. 4.60).

wide adhesive tape is used to tape the distal
end of the stockinette in place. The proximal
end of the stockinette is also taped in place
with a 1-inch (2.5cm)-wide adhesive tape
strip that is placed circumferentially with
half of its width on the stockinette and half
on the haired skin of the limb. This strip
may overlap the first strip (fig. 4.61).
Fg. 4.61. From Smafl Animal Distar Limb injuries, published by
Teton New Media (in press).
Aftercare
● The animal's exercise should be limited and preferably confined to soft surfaces. Keeping the stocki-
nette clean and dry is important.
Periodically, the stockinette should be observed for signs of wear over the area of the pressure/
abrasion lesion to determine if a bandage change is indicated.
●A piece of waterproof tape can be placed over the area of stockinette that receives the most wear to
prolong its usefulness and avoid frequent bandage changes.
Advantages and complications
This type of bandage provides three layers of stockinette coverage over the lesion area of small dogs and
cats until the animal can position the paw normally following nerve regeneration. This coverage is inex-
pensive. However, it would not be sufficient for larger dogs due to the wear the animal would place on
the stockinette.
Carpal sling
Indications
The carpal sling is indicated to prevent weight-bearing on a forelimb without having to immobilize the
entire limb. It is useful for short periods when it is important that the animal not bear weight but when
padan naaq su s a e si andxa adoo i panan po si q aa a po aqo
but is not sufficiently strong to withstand immediate walking forces. A soft tissue example is reconstruc-
tive surgery or wound management on a paw pad. The sling allows the elbow and shoulder to flex and
extend but prevents the paw from touching the ground.
76  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
Technique
 The animal is positioned in lateral recum-
bency with the affected limb up. The carpus
is palpated to assure that flexion is not
uncomfortable (fig. 4.62). Many dogs lose
mobility in the carpi as they age, and it
might be painful if the carpus is flexed for a
prolonged period.
Fg. 4.62.
● The carpus should be flexed, but not beyond
90 degrees. Excessive flexion may be uncom-

fortable for the animal. An initial layer of
cast padding is applied to the paw and
distal antibrachium  in  a figure-of-eight
manner. Excessive bulk around or behind
the joint should be avoided. The middle two
digits can be left exposed to assess for swell-
ing during aftercare (figs. 4.63, 4.64).
Fg. 4.64.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints

 A second layer of roll gauze is then applied,
taking care to avoid tension (fig. 4.65).
Fig. 4.65.
Finally, 2-inch (5.0 cm)-wide porous adhe-
Fig.4.66.
sive tape is applied in a similar figure-of-
eight pattern without tension (fig. 4.66).
Using the same type of tape, a final loop is
made around the entire bandage (fig. 4.67).
Fg. 4.67.
78  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
●The animal should then be able to stand
comfortably without the sling slipping off
(fig. 4.68).
Fg. 4.68.
Aftercare
This animal should be monitored carefully to assure that the toes are not swelling and that the bandage
is not slipping. The sling should not be used for longer than two weeks, and it should be checked twice
daily during that time.
If the sling is being used as part of the treatment of a paw pad injury, it will be necessary to remove
and replace it periodically to allow wound treatment.
Advantages and complications
Movement is important for joint health, and this sling allows motion of the elbow and shoulder
joints. This is helpful if an articular fracture of the elbow has been repaired. The sling will result in
some temporary stiffness of the carpus after it is removed. Thus, it should not be left in place for
longer than two weeks. The biggest complication is that the animal slips the sling off cranially. However,
this can be avoided with sufficient carpal flexion and proper application of the figure-of-eight
technique.
Basic forelimb splint
This information for splints on the forelimb also applies to the pelvic limb (see page 93 this chapter, Basic
Pelvic Limb Splint).
Indications
Splints are used for a variety of purposes, including to support some fractures or ligamentous instability
of e raao heio uns e se yons 1eda1 [eoibms e pnaloid ol 10
Technique
Although pictures for this technique are for a forelimb splint, the principles of the technique are the same
for applying a splint to the pelvic limb. Splints may be purchased from various companies or may be
fashioned in a custom manner using fiberglass tape or temperature-dependent plastics.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints 
79
 The initial steps in application of a splint are
 the same as for applying a soft padded
 bandage (see page 47 this chapter, Forelimb
Bandages, Casts, and Splints; Basic Soft
Padded Limb Bandage). The steps are fol-
 lowed up through the application of the roll 
 gauze. The final protective layer is not
applied.
After applying the roll gauze, an appropri-

 ate splint is selected. If a commercial product
is used, whether plastic or aluminum, assure
that it fits well with the size of the animal
and amount of padding that has been used
(figs. 4.69, 4.70). The length of the splint may
be trimmed if necessary.
The splint should then be secured to the
limb using roll gauze (figs. 4.71, 4.72). The
gauze should not be a stretchable variety

 80  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
● A final protective layer (2 inch [5.0cm] wide
porous adhesive tape or elastic adhesive
tape) should then be added (figs. 4.73, 4.74).
● If fiberglass casting tape is used, the initial
steps are the same. The width of the casting
 tape chosen should be sufficient to cover at
least one-third of the circumference of the
limb. The casting tape may either be wetted
Fg. 4.73.
as a roll and then unrolled on the limb or
unrolled on a flat surface prior to being
wetted. In either case, it is vital to avoid
stretching the casting tape when it is being
urolled as it will slowly shrink back which
may excessively shorten the splint. The
warmer the water is to wet the tape, the
quicker it will harden. Beginners should use
colder water to wet the tape. It is best to use
gloved hands while handling the fiberglass
so that the resin on the tape does not stick
to the user's skin.
Fg. 4.74.
●If casting tape is wetted while it is rolled,
the water should be worked all the way
through the roll prior to forming the splint.
Placing the roll in the water and lifting it out
 in a scooping-type motion so the edge of the
tape is facing up may allow water to be
pulled down through the tape by gravity.
After the roll is thoroughly wetted, excess
water should be squeezed out so the under-
lying bandage does not absorb the moisture
(figs. 4.75, 4.76).
Fg. 4.75.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints  81
Fig. 4.76.
 The end of the tape is held at one end of the
limb, and it is unrolled up and down the
length of the bandage several times to layer
the tape on the bandage. The layering
should continue until sufficient thickmess
is achieved, at which point the tape is cut
(fig. 4.77).
Fg. 4.77.
 The tape is then carefully smoothed and
shaped to conform to the limb (fig. 4.78).
 The splint is then secured to the limb using
roll gauze before it sets (figs. 4.79, 4.80). It is
important thiat all the layers of the fiberglass
bond to each other. Thus, movement of the
patient or splint should be avoided while
the fiberglass is hardening. Furthermore,
fingers or by table edges should be avoided
because indentations may result in pressure
sores.

tion (fig. 4.82).

swelling (separation of the digits), which would indicate the bandage is too tight and needs to be changed.
A veterinarian should be contacted if the animal's use of the limb decreases.
If the bandage and splint have been used to treat a draining wound, periodic bandage change will be
necessary (see page 47 this chapter, Forelimb Bandages, Casts, and Splints; Basic Soft Padded Limb
Bandage).
Advantages and complications
The soft padded bandage portion of the appliance is easy to apply, and it provides some support and
protection for a variety of conditions. The addition of a splint provides an additional moderate amount
of stability, and it is easy to place and remove. The bandage and splint combination are a good means of
immobilizing joints when wound management requires such immobility. General complications include
bandage and splint slipping, pressure wounds, and mutilation by the animal. If any of these are suspected,
the bandage and splint should be changed. Each area of the bandage has its advantages and complications
(see page 47 this chapter, Forelimb Bandages, Casts, and Splints; Basic Soft Padded Limb Bandage).
Basic forelimb cast
The information for casts on the pelvic limb also applies to the forelimb (see page 93 this chapter, Pelvic
Limb Bandages, Casts, and Splints; Basic Pelvic Limb Cast)
Spica bandage and lateral splint
Indications
The spica bandage and splint is a method of immobilizing the entire forelimb in extension. This bandage
and splint can be used when moderate immobilization of the forelimb area is required. It is particularly
useful for upper limb immobilization. Some indications include scapular fractures or to support surgical
stabilization of elbow luxations. Additionally, the spica bandage and splint is indicated for conservative
 84  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
treatment of lateral shoulder luxations or to provide support following surgical repair. It is not recom-
 mended to manage medial shoulder luxations.
 For soft tissue injuries, the spica bandage and splint are primarily indicated for managing wounds over
the point of the elbow, such as elbow hygromas and open or closed wounds over the olecranon. Healing
of wounds in this location require extension and immobilization, which the spica bandage and splint
provide. Extension keeps the animal from bending the elbow to get in sternal recumbency which would
put pressure on the area. Immobilization keeps the tissues from moving so they can heal.
Technique
The spica bandage and splint utilizes standard bandage material and incorporates either fiberglass casting
 material or aluminum splint rod. The bandage and splint can be applied with the animal standing or in
lateral recumbency with the affected limb up. Application is generally easier with the animal standing.
but that requires some degree of cooperation from the animal. If the animal is in lateral recumbency, it
must be frequently lifted in order to pass the bandage material around the thorax. When an animal is
anesthetized, care must be taken to avoid excessive tightmess, which might interfere with chest excursions
and respiration.
 Application of a spica bandage and splint
begins with several layers of cast padding.
 The bandage should begin at the digits and
progress up the limb as would be the case
for an ordinary soft padded bandage (fig-
4.83).
Fg. 4.83.
The cast padding is then continued over the
dorsum of the animal and around the thorax
both in front and behind the limb (figs. 4.84,
4.85).
Fg. 4.84.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints 
85
Fg. 4.85.
Care should be taken with all layers to avoid
wrapping the bandage too tightly around
the thorax. After two to three layers of cast
padding are applied, a layer of roll gauze is
unrolled over the padding to secure the
bandage (fig. 4.86).
Fig. 4.86.
 Fiberglass casting tape is the best material
to use for the splint. It may be unrolled to
the proper length to extend from the digits
to over the shoulder area prior to its wetting.
or it may be wetted and unrolled on the
patient as shown (fig. 4.87). Alternatively, a
length of aluminum splint rod can be bent 
m the shape of an elongated loop that
extends from the digits to over the shoul-
ders. It is then fashioned to the curvatures
of the lateral aspect of the limb as much as
possible.
Fig. 4.87.
 86  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
The casting tape must extend over the
 dorsum and down the opposite side of the
lize the limb (fig. 4.88).
Fg. 4.88.
● The casting tape should be fashioned in a
broad enough manner to cover the lateral
aspect of the shoulder area and extend
slightly around the cranial portion of the
shoulder joint (fig. 4.89).
Fg. 4.89.
 The casting material or aluminum splint rod
loop is then held in place with an additional
layer of roll gauze. If casting material is
used, it is allowed to dry (figs. 4.90, 4.91). It
is important that the animal not be allowed
to move during the drying of the splint if
fiberglass casting material has been used.
Fg. 4.90.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints 
Fig. 4.91.
● Finally, a protective outer layer is wrapped
over the splint, avoiding undue tension
(fig. 4.92).
 If the splint has been applied as part of the
treatment of a wound over the point of the
elbow, a window can be cut in the splint and
bandage over this area to allow wound care.
Fig. 4.92.
Aftercare
The bandage and splint should be monitored closely. Observation is important to be sure the animal is
not having trouble breathing and that there is no slippage of the bandage and splint or limb underneath.
If the limb seems to have excessive motion, the front of the shoulder may be slipping out of the cranial
aspect of the splint.
For wound care over the point of the elbow, treatment is done through the window in the splint and
bandage. A small bandage is placed over the window following each treatment. If lavage is done on the
wound, measures should be taken to avoid geting the bandage material around the window wet.
Advantages and complications
The spica bandage and splint provides a good method for immobilizing the entire forelimb. It does not
provide rigid support, so it is not sufficient to immobilize most fractures below the scapula. If an alumi-
am se rapmous a jo jun a aiqou jou e n uds jena a rog pasn si doon pon puds wmu
and may not be as comfortable for the animal.
Because of its length and immobility, the splint is somewhat awkward for the animal. Most animals
will adapt after a few days, but some will not tolerate it. Special care should be taken to assure that the
 88  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
 animal does not get into a lateral recumbent position from which it is unable to rise. This may be especially
true for animals that are obese or otherwise debilitated.
When the splint is used to treat soft tissue wounds over the point of the elbow, it provides the immo-
bilization and extension necessary for soft tissue healing. When a window is cut over the point of the
elbow, it conserves on bandage materials since only the portion of bandage over the wound is changed
daily. If the portion of the bandage around the window becomes wet during wound care, it can become
a source of bacterial growth. Thus, care must be used in cleaning the wound surface.
Aluminum rod loop elbow splint
Indications
Another method to immobilize the elbow is to use a cranially-applied splint made from aluminum splint
the healing of soft tissue wounds over the point of the elbow, such as elbow hygromas and open or closed
wounds over the olecranon. The splint does not immobilize the shoulder at all.
Technique
The splint can be applied with the patient standing or in lateral recumbency with the affected limb up.
The choice of position may depend on the animal's body shape.
●If an open or closed wound is present in the
area, the appropriate medication and
 primary bandage layer are applied to the
wound.
●A soft-padded bandage secondary layer is
wrapped around the elbow area. On animals
with long, thin legs, the bandage is extended
into the axilla and stopped. On other
animals, it may be necessary to continue this
wrap over the shoulders and around the
thorax in the form of a spica bandage (fig.
4.93; see page 83 this chapter, Spica Bandage
and Lateral Splint),
Fg. 4.93.
●A section of the appropriate-sized alumi-
num splint rod is bent into a narrow rect-
angle, and an angle is bent at the midpoint
of the long sides of the rectangle (fig. 4.94)
Fg. 4.94.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints 
68
●The splint should conform to the natural
standing angle of the elbow and fit closely
against the bandage with the bend of the
splint positioned at the bend of the elbow
(fig. 4.95). The splint is then secured using
roll gauze and an outer protective layer.
 If a wound is to be treated over the point of
the elbow, a window can be cut in the
bandage over the wound to allow
treatment.
Fg. 4.95.
Aftercare
The bandage and splint should be monitored carefully. The animal should be closely observed to note
any change in its willingness to put weight on the leg, as this could indicate slippage or formation of a
bandage sore. In this case, the bandage and splint should be changed.
If a wound is being treated over the point of the elbow, treatment is done through the window in the
bandage. A small bandage is placed over the window following each treatment. If lavage is done on the
wound, measures should be taken to avoid geting the bandage material around the window wet.
Advantages and complications
This bandage and splint are easier to apply and may be better tolerated than a spica bandage and splint
since the shoulder is not immobilized. It provides the immobilization and extension necessary for soft
tissue healing. When a window is cut over the point of the elbow, it conserves on bandage material since
only a portion of bandage over the wound is changed daily. If the portion of the bandage around the
window becomes wet during wound care, it can become a source of bacterial growth. Thus, care should
be used in cleaning the wound surface.
Velpeau sling
Indications
The Velpeau sling can be used to prevent weight bearing on a forelimb in a variety of situations. If the
 s redien e seio ped jo puad m se uns ueq am puaid ci st asodmd a
be more comfortable than a Velpeau sling since the latter places both the carpus and elbow in tight flexion
(see page 75 this chapter, Carpal Sling).
The Velpeau sling also helps to lateralize the proximal humerus and is therefore useful in conservative
management of medial shoulder luxations. This lateralizing effect makes it unsuitable for lateral shoulder
luxations and for some scapular fractures.
Technique
The Velpeau sling supports the front limb in a flexed position against the animal's thorax (fig. 4.96). The
sling is applied using standard layers of material in order to pad, support, and protect. The sling can
be applied with the animal standing or in lateral recumbency with the affected limb up. Application is
generally easier with the animal standing, but it requires some degree of cooperation from the patient.
90  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
Fg. 4.96. Front limb is being held in the position that the Velpeau sling will ultimately maintain.
When the animal is in lateral recumbency, it must be lifted frequently to pass the bandage material around
the thorax. When an animal is anesthetized, care must be taken to avoid excessive tightmess, which might
 interfere with chest excursions and respiration.
 The Velpeau sling application is begun by
using cast padding to wrap around the limb
distal to the carpus, wrapping two to three
times (fig. 4.97).
Fg. 4.97.
●While holding the limb in the desired flexed
position, the cast padding is brought up
over the dorsum of the animal and around
the thorax back to the limb to hold it in the
flexed position against the thorax (fig. 4.98).
Fg. 4.98.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints

 The cast padding wrapping is continued
until two to three layers have covered the
thorax and flexed limb, to include the front
of the carpus (fig. 4.99).
Fg. 4.99.
 A similar wrapping pattern is placed over
 this initial layer using roll gauze or white
tape (fig. 4.100).
Fig. 4.100.
Care should be taken to ensure that the
wrapping material supports the front of the
carpus so the limb carmot slip cranially out
of the sling (fig. 4.101).
Fg. 4.101.

 Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
●Finally, a protective outer layer of 2 inch
(5.0cm) wide porous adhesive tape or
elastic adhesive tape is applied to the sling
(fig. 4.102).
Fg. 4.102.
Aftercare
The sling should be closely monitored. Vigilance is important to be sure the animal is not having any
trouble breathing and that there is no slippage of the sling or limb underneath. The sling should be left
 in place only as long as necessary to treat the primary problem. However, its presence beyond two weeks
 may result in problems. After removing the sling, activity should be gradually increased over several
weeks to allow the tissues to adjust to restoration of mobility.
Advantages and complications
The Velpeau sling provides a secure method of immobilizing the forelimb. However, it is confining
and may be slightly uncomfortable for the animal initially. If it is applied too tightly, movement of the
chest wall could be compromised, causing respiratory distress. If the flexed carpus and paw are com-
uonnnsqo remosea Sunsixaaid st arat j ro 'sdigs ro suasool sus au j! 'adel ro aznea snsepa Aq passaid
of the paw, there may be necrosis of the skin and underlying structures. Because all joints of the limb are
immobilized, cartilage health is compromised, and lameness may be present when the sling is removed.
If the sling is used more than two weeks, joint contracture can occur due to the severe flexion of the
forelimb joints.
When attempting to immobilize the axillary area of a cat to support the healing of a wound in this area,
a Velpeau sling would seem to be indicated in principle; however, this sling is not tolerated well by cats.
One author (SFs) has found that immobilization of the axillary region on a cat is best accomplished
by cage rest and a cardboard box. A box large enough to accommodate the cat is placed up-side-down in

like to get in such accommodations and will sit in sternal recumbency in the box with all limbs flexed,
thus gaining some immobilization of the axillary region. A large opened paper sack will also serve this
purpose.
Pelvic limb bandages, casts, and splints
Basic soft padded limb bandage
The information for the basic soft padded limb bandage on the forelimb also applies to the pelvic limb
(see page 47 this chapter, Forelimb Bandages, Casts, and Splints; Basic Soft Padded Limb Bandage).
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints  93
Basic pelvic limb splint
The information for splints on the forelimb also applies to the pelvic limb (see page 78 this chapter, Basic
Forelimb Splint).
Basic pelvic limb cast
 The information for casts on the pelvic limb also applies to the forelimb (see page 83 this chapter, Basic
Forelimb Cast).
Indications
 Casting can be performed to address a variety of situations in which immobilization of a portion of a limb
is needed. Although a cast does not provide rigid stabilization of bones, the support is often sufficient to
allow healing of selected fractures. Additionally, casts can be used to provide support postoperatively in
cases such as arthrodeses or soft tissue reconstructions. If necessary, casts can be split longitudinally into

bilization of a wound that needed periodic treatment or to check for and accommodate limb swelling (see
Advantages and Complications, below). Half of the splint cast can be used as a splint. However, this
decreases the stability compared to a cast.
Technique
Although the pictures for this technique are for a pelvic limb cast, the principles of the technique are the
same for applying a cast to a forelimb.
 The initial steps in application of a cast are
similar to those for a soft padded bandage.
However, there are some important differ-
Ences. Tape "stirrups" are placed and cotton
pieces are placed in the interdigital and
interpad areas as with a soft padded
 bandage (see page 47 this chapter, Forelimb
 Bandages and Splints, Basic Soft Padded
Bandage).
 Regular cast: Throughout cast application,
the limb should be held in a neutral position
with each joint moderately flexed in a func-
tional manner.
A length of stockinette is cut to twice the
length of the limb to be casted. The length
used to measure should extend proximal to
the most proximal extent of the proposed

cast by two to three inches (5.0-7.6cm)
and beyond the digits by a similar distance
(fig. 4.103).

●The stockinette is doubled onto itself to

create a double thickness, and it is placed on
the limb. The author (WCR) finds it easiest
to do this by rolling half the length of the
stockinette from one end in a conventional
manner (fig. 4.104) and rolling from the
opposite end by rolling the stockinette in on
itself (fig. 4.105).
Fg. 4.105.
●The end of the stockinette that was rolled
conventionally is then rolled up onto the
limb. The remaining portion is then easily
unrolled over the first layer (figs. 4.106,
4.107, 4.108). It is important to leave several
inches of stockinette protruding beyond the
end of the digits.
Auoq 1aao paserd are Suipped jo ,sinuo,
prominences as described for soft padded
bandages. These donuts are usually placed
under the stockinette. Thus, the stockinette
holds them in place. It is important that they
do not slip out of place as the remaining
 bandage layers are applied.

 Cast padding (fig. 4.109) and then roll gauze
(fig. 4.110) are placed over the stockinette as
described for a soft padded bandage.
Generally, about three to four plies of cast
padding are sufficient (It should be remem-
bered that by overlapping fifty percent, each
"layer" of bandage material actually adds
two thicknesses of material). The stockinette
should protrude from each end of the
bandage (fig. 4.11).

Examination gloves should be donned and
the fiberglass casting material to be used
should be thoroughly wetted. Warm water
will result in the cast's setting more quickly.
Thus, beginners should use colder water to
 allow more time for application. It is impor-
tant to work the water all the way to the
innermost layers of the rol. Placing the
 roll in the water and lifting it out in a scoop-
ing motion so the edge of the tape is facing
up may allow water to be pulled down
through the tape by gravity. After it is
completely saturated, the roll should be
squeezed to eliminate excess water so the
uderlying bandage does not absorb the

moisture (fig. 4.112).
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints 97
 The casting tape is applied from distal to
proximal being careful to achieve fifty
percent overlap with each wrap and to
avoid wrinkles (fig. 4.113). Care should be
taken not to place tension on the tape as it
 is applied since that will result in the cast's
becoming excessively tight.
Fg. 4.113.
The distal ernd of the casting tape layer
should be even with the end of the digits,
with the underlying layers extending past
the fiberglass by 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5.0 cm).
 Additional rolls of casting tape are applied
until the desired thickness is achieved. The
final result should be a smooth cast with
each layer bonded to those beneath (fig.
4.114).
Fg. 4.114.
Before the cast hardens, the stockinette and
cast padding are pulled over each end of the
cast to create a padded edge over the ends
of the cast (fig. 4.115).
Fig. 4.115.
98  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
 The cast is allowed to harden. During hard-
ening, care should be taken not to allow
fingers or rigid supports (table edges, etc.)
to indent the cast as this could predispose
to pressure wounds.
 The "stirrups" are folded up against the
 distal end of the cast. A final protective layer
 of 2 inch (5.0 cm) wide porous adhesive tape
or elastic adhesive tape is applied after the
cast has hardened (fig. 4.116).

"Bivalving" a cast: A cast cutting saw can be
used to make a bivalved cast that can be
 removed and replaced periodically. A cast-

cutting saw is used to split the cast longitu-
dinally along the lateral and medial aspects
for the forelimb or the cranial and caudal
aspects for the pelvic limb (fig. 4.117). Cast
splitters are helpful to separate the two
halves of the cast (figs. 4.118, 4.119). At times
the two halves of the cast can be reapplied
(fig. 4.120).
Fg. 4.118.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints
56
Fig. 4.119.
Fg. 4.120.
Aftercare
The cast should be carefully monitored. It should be kept clean and dry, and the animal should not be
allowed to lick or chew at it. The two exposed digits should be examined for signs of swelling (separation
of the digits), which would indicate the cast is too tight and needs to be changed or bivalved. A veterinar-
ian should be contacted if the animal's use of the limb decreases.
 If the cast has been used to immobilize a draining wound, periodic bandage change will be necessary.
Thus, a bivalved cast will be necessary to allow periodic removal for bandage change (see page 47 this
of the cast can be applied to the limb as a splint, with the application on the side opposite the location of
the wound.
Advantages and complications
A cast provides the most rigid stabilization of a limb. Because it is so rigid, and because it may be in place
for a longer period, casts can result in pressure wounds, especially over bony prominences. Early detec-
tion is the key to preventing serious problems. If there is any indication that a problem is developing (i.e.,
wet or dirty cast, spots on the cast, offensive odor to the cast, decreased limb use, or licking and chewing
at the cast), the cast should be removed and the limb should be inspected. If necessary, the two halves of
100  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
the cast may be replaced after new inner bandage layers are applied. Pressure wounds that do develop
should be cared for and adjustments should be made to prevent further pressure by the cast, such as not
applying the cast directly over the wound. For example, when using the cast that has been split for
removal, one-half of the cast can be used as a splint on the opposite side of the limb, or cutting a window
in the cast over the wound can be considered.
Early placement of a cast on a limb where there has been trauma resulting in fractures with no displace-
ment can have the potential for complications. With the cast in place, there is no accommodation for the
edema that will result over the first few days following injury. Thus, the swelling of the limb that is con-
fined in the cast may encroach on blood vessels. The result can be ischemic necrosis of soft tissues. In such
cases, a bivalved cast should be considered until swelling subsides.
Ehmer sling
Indications
The Ehmer sling is used to maintain the head of the femur in the acetabulum following closed reduction
 of a cranio-dorsal coxofemoral luxation. It should not be used to support reduction after a ventral
luxation.
 Prior to placing an Ehmer sling, it is important to assure that proper case selection has occurred in order
to maximize the chances of success. Animals with chronic luxation, poor conformation, avulsions within
the joint, or other injuries are usually poor candidates for closed reduction of coxofemoral luxation.
 Additionally, appropriate technique in reducing the joint is vital.
Technique
This sling should provide internal rotation of the limb, flexion of the hip, and abduction of the limb. The
sling is usually placed with the animal in lateral recumbency with the affected limb up. The limb should
be held flexed with slight internal rotation of the lower limb.
●An initial two to three layers of cast padding
are placed around the metatarsal area to
begin the application (fig. 4.121).
Fg. 4.121.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints 
¥101
Two-inch (5.0cm)-wide porous adhesive
tape is used for the remainder of the
bandage. The tape is initially placed on
 the metatarsal area by placing it around the
caudal surface with the adhesive side of
the tape against the initial wrap. The tape is
brought cranially in such a way that the
adhesive sides meet cranially (fig. 4.122).
Thus, the tape does not completely encircle
the metatarsal area. This technique helps to
guard against placing tape too tightly
around the metatarsal area.
Fg. 4.122.
 The tape is then brought, adhesive side
against the animal, up the medial aspect of
the crus and around the cranial aspect of the
thigh just proximal to the stifle (fig. 4.123).
Fig. 4.123.
● The tape then continues around the caudal
aspect of the crus and onto the medial side
of the hock to then finish caudally on the
metatarsal area (figs. 4.124, 4.125). This layer
can be repeated. When this portion of the
bandage is completed, the lateral aspect of
the crus should be visible (i.e., no tape
should have crossed the lateral aspect
of the hock). Internal rotation should be
maintained.
Fig. 4.124.
102  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
Fg. 4.125.
 The abdominal support portion of the sling
begins with tape being applied at the meta-
tarsal region as previously described (fig.
4.126).
Fig. 4.126.
 The tape is brought up the lateral aspect of
the limb and then over the dorsum of the
animal. In order to avoid a shift in the skin,
which would let the limb slip down as soon
as the animal stands, the skin of the flank
should gently be pulled ventrally (arrow)
before the tape is applied (fig. 4.127).

side of the animal and around the ventral

Fg. 4.131.
Aftercare
The Ehmer sling has a higher likelihood of causing bandage-related wounds than some other bandages
because the skin is thin where it is applied and because tape is applied directly to the skin. Special care
should be taken to watch for slipping of the sling and the development of bandage-related wounds. One
 particular area to be observed for a pressure wound is the caudal aspect of the metatarsal area. If any
wounds develop, the sling should be modified immediately or removed.
Recheck visits with the veterinarian are advised, and the sling should not be left in place for more than
10 to 14 days. Removal of the sling can be uncomfortable for an animal since the tape has been applied
directly to the skin. Commercial products are available to help remove adhesive tape bandages. Following
removal, the animal should be confined for an additional two to four weeks while it regains range of
motion in the limb.
Upon having the Ehmer sling removed, an animal may not use the limb for a day or two because of
stiffness. The animal should not be forced to use the limb; however, it should be assured that the coxo-
femoral joint is still in place. The animal should improve consistently with each day.
Advantages and complications
The Ehmer sling accomplishes the necessary positioning of the pelvic limb that counters the tendency for
relaxation following cranio-dorsal hip luxation. Such positioning would be contraindicated for luxations
 in other directions. Bandage-related wounds can result from an Ehmer sling, so careful attention must be
paid to the calcaneal tendon area, the caudal metatarsal area, the inguinal area, and the medial thigh and
crus areas.
90/90 sling
Indications
The 90/90 sling is a method for preventing weight-bearing on a pelvic limb and/or achieving flexion of
the hock and stifle joints. Thus, it would be indicated for treating orthopedic conditions where these
qualities are needed. It could be considered for preventing weight-bearing on a paw where significant
surgery had been done on the pads, such as pad grafts.

Technique
 The animal is placed in lateral recumbency
with the affected limb up.
A length of 2-inch (5.0 cm)-wide porous
 adhesive tape is reserved for later use (fig.

ranially in such a way that the adhesive
sides meet cranially (figs. 4.134, 4.135). Thus,
the tape does not completely encircle the
metatarsal area. This technique helps to
guard against placing tape too tightly
around the metatarsal area.

 The reserved piece of tape (see above) is laid
adhesive side up along the femoral area.
With the hock and stifle flexed, the tape that
began on the metatarsal area is brought up
the lateral aspect of the crus and around the
cranial aspect of the femoral area, with the
adhesive side against the animal (fig. 4.136).
This tape should cross over the reserved
piece of tape at a 90-degree angle. The
reserved piece should extend 4 to 6 inches
(10-15.2cm) ventrally past the crossing
piece.
Fg. 4.136.
●The tape that started on the metatarsal area
is then brought down the medial aspect of
the crus and returned around the caudal

 to limit weight-bearing on a hind limb and will maintain flexion of most joints in the leg. It does not allow
Tie-over bandage
Indications
The tie-over bandage can be used to protect open, sutured, or grafted wounds on the proximal aspect of
the pelvic limb. The bandage can also be used for wounds in the pelvic area.

Aftercare
See page 29 in chapter 3, Thoracic, Abdominal Tie-Over Bandage.
Extremity Bandages, Casts, and Splints  109
Advantages and complications
proximal limb or truncal bandage are not necessary for a tie-over bandage. The centripetal force from
tying the umbilical tape or elastic strip can be considered as a supplement to wound contraction when
treating an open wound.
A potential complication of the tie-over bandage is that the suture loops might cut into the skin if the
tie-over strip is tied too tightly. Contamination of the secondary layer of the bandage is possible. However,
placing tape or some form of impermeable material over the bandage reduces chances of this
complication.

Restraint
The use of physical restraining devices to deter an animal from molesting a bandage, cast, or splint should
be considered. This is especially needed when the animal will be unsupervised.
Elizabethan collar
Elizabethan collars are an effective way of keeping an animal's teeth and tongue away from a bandage,
cast, or splint caudal to the head. They are also effective in keeping paws away from head bandages.
Appropriately sized, plastic Elizabethan collars that have loops at the base to accommodate a collar or a
length of gauze are the most effective type of collar (fig. 5.1).

Because the collar extends beyond the animal's muzzle, it may be difficult for it to eat and drink from
a bowl on the floor. The animal should be observed to see if this is a problem. If it is, several options can
be tried. Elevating the bowls may be necessary. Smaller deep bowls that fit inside the collar could be tried.
Third, the collar may be removed and then replaced after the animal eats and drinks.
For small dogs, a large plastic bowl can be modified and used similar to the way an Elizabethan collar
is used.

Rigid, plastic wrap-around collars with fasteners (Bite Not Collar, Bite Not Products, San Francisco, CA)
can be placed around an animal's neck. They are available in various sizes and extend from just behind
the ears to the shoulders. They are equipped with a fabric strap that encircles the thorax just behind the
forelimbs. This keeps the collar from coming off over the animal's head (fig. 5.5).
dog's head.
These collars are effective in keeping an animal from molesting areas caudal to the shoulders. However,
they would not be effective in protecting a head bandage. They may not protect the distal limbs from
molestation. The collars should be removed daily to check for underlying dermatitis.
Towel collar
A large terry cloth bath towel can be used similar to the way a Bite Not Collar is used.
114  Small Animal Bandaging, Casting, and Splinting Techniques
 A large terry cloth towel is folded such that
its width extends from just behind the dog's
ears to the shoulders. The folded towel is
wrapped around the dog's neck (fig. 5.6).
Fg. 5.6.
Two strips of 2-inch (5.0cm)-wide adhesive
tape are wrapped circumferentially around

muzzles that are used temporarily to protect handlers from animal bites should not be used. These become
 soaked with saliva, and they are messy and unsanitary. They could also interfere with the dog's breathing
 Or ability to vomit, following sedation, for example. Wire basket-type muzzles should be used.
Wire and plastic basket muzzles are available in various sizes and can be obtained commercially (fig.
5.8). If a dog tends to pull the muzzle off over its nose with its front paws, a strip of 1-inch (2.5cm)-wide
adhesive tape can be folded over on itself lengthwise to provide a means to help prevent this. The strip
extends from the portion of the muzzle that is over the nasal area to the strap that goes behind the ears.
Thus, it lies up between the eyes. If the muzzle rubs on the side of the face causing a lesion, a larger
muzzle should be considered. However, if the lesion is the result of the dog's activity, the area of the

Topical chemical deterrents
 Topical chemical deterrents in the form of bitter-tasting materials may be placed on bandages, casts,
splints, or around suture lines on intact skin to prevent molestation. These come in various liquid and
semiliquid forms and a tape form (fig. 5.18). For best results, a small amount of the material should be
placed on or near the dog's nose prior to its use on the bandage, cast, splint, or skin. This allows the
animal to lick and smell the substance simultaneously. The substance is then placed on the bandage, cast,
splint, or intact skin and the animal will associate the lingering scent with the bitter taste. The authors
have had limited success with topical chemical deterrents.
