Preface
The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion:SmallAnimalDermatology
is designed as a quick reference text for the clinician and student ofveterinary
medicine.There areseveral excellent texts available in veterinary dermatology and
dermatopathology.These books offerdetailedinformationregarding structure and
function of the skinpathophysiology ofdisease,clinicaldescriptions of cutaneous
diseases,diagnostic techniques,microscopic anatomy and pathology of the skin,
and current therapy.Although these are excellent reference texts and are certainly
required by all clinical and personal veterinary libraries, there was a need for a
handbook tomake thisinformationreadily accessible in theworkplace.
This text is designed to aid the veterinary student and clinician in recognizing
various skin disorders by acting as a guide through an extensive yet reasonable dif-
ferential diagnosticlist,providingdirectioninchoosing themostappropriateand
applicable diagnostic tests,and offering current therapeutic options.As clinicians,
we often have a limited amount of time during appointments and are forced to
make rapid,yet accurate decisions.This handbook is a condensed guide that can
aid in those decisions.Several of the chapters havebeen adapted from thesecond
edition of the5-MinuteVeterinary Consult,CanineandFeline,forwhichIserved
as the dermatology section editor.All of the dermatology section chapters from the
5-Mimute Consult areincluded,plus pertinent chaptersfrom other sectionsin the
text.There are several features that areunique to theHandbook including chapters
therapy,ifferentialdiagnosticlistsforcommonclnicalpresentations,andsaml
client education handouts from a specialty dermatology practice (KHR).Also,a
dermatologic drug formulary is added,and colorphotographs arecoordinatedwith
each chapter. Cutaneous disorders as a primary or concurrent owner complaint
comprise a large percentage,20-75%,of clinical cases inveterinary practicesand
the number of recognized diseases is rapidly expanding.Not only is the list of dif-
vii

The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
ferentials extensive but the variety of species presented is also increasing.For this
reason,asection describingcommon dermatologicdisordersofexoticpetshasbeen
included.
The client education handouts are a great time-saving device. Client education
handouts can offer extensive information ona specific disorder and thus act as an
adjunct to the clinician's explanation and instructions.Ihave included some of my
personal specialtypracticehandoutsfor use as a template,or theymaybegiven to
the client asis.I find that owners appreciate receiving written information that they
can study at home in a stress-free environment.
The Clinical Companion is organized into (11) sections.Section 1,Diagnostics,
includes chapters on techniques for practical cytology with multiple color plates
and an informational guide for steps in obtaining a diagnostic biopsy sample.Sec-
tion 2,Differential Diagnoses Based on Clinical Patterns,provides lists with brief
descriptions of differentials tobe considered in cases of alopecia,erosive and ul
cerativedsordercalingandcrustingdrmatoses,xfoliativeirders,papua
and nodular dermatoses,and vesicularand pustular dermatoses-all complete with
photographic examples.Section 3,Differential Diagnoses Based on Regional Le-
sions,organizes differentialsbased on bodylocation suchaspododermatoses and
nailbed disorders,nasal dermatoses,depigmenting disorders,otitis,anal sac disor-
ders andperianal fistulas,acne,and acral lickdermatitis.Section4,ParasiticDr-
matoses, addresses common cutaneous parasites such as ticks and associated dis-
eases,fleas and various control products with individual advantagesand
disadvantages,cheyletiellosis,modicosis,todectes,and toxicitiesassociatd
with common parasiticides.Section5,Allergic andHypersensitivity Dermatitis,in-
trol,anaphylaxis,inhalant/percutaneous allergic dermatitis,food hypersensitiv
ity/intolerance,contact dermatitis，eosinophilic granuloma complex lesions,
hypereosinophilic syndrome,and cutaneous drug eruptions.Section 6,Infectious
Dermatoses,covers a broad range ofagents encountered inveterinary dermatology.
Section7,EndocrineDermatoses,includeshypothyroidism,hyperadrenocorticism,
growth hormone-responsive dermatoses,sex hormone dermatoses,steroid hep
atopathy,andfeline skinfragility syndrome.Section8,Immunologic/Autoimmune
Disorders,addresses the common cutaneous diseases encountered in clinical prac-
tice （pemphiguscomplex,bullouspemphigoid,LE,LE,panniculitisvasculitis
uveodermatologic syndrome-VKH-like disease).Section 9,Cutaneous Neo-
plasias,offersclinicalphotoshistopathologicdescriptions,andtherapeuticoption
for common cutaneous neoplasias.Section 10,Exotic Pet Dermatology,covers
commondrmatologicdisordersfguineais,rretsrabbitandmiceectin
11,SelectedTopics,is acompilation ofunique dermatoses:and includesan expla
nation of the appropriate and efficacious use of topical therapy.Section12,Labo-
ratory Tests/Interpretation includes ACTH testing.The appendices include client
education handouts and a dermatologic drug formulary for quick reference.In my
practice，the handouts are selected for the individual client, completed (fill in the
blanks),and placed in a folder for the client to take home.This folder contains all
informationregardingphone/fax communication andmedical information for the
pet.Prescriptions are affixed to the folder so that all instructions arekept together
inapackage.

Cytology of Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Lesions
INDIcATIoNs: Cytology is often helpful in determining the etiology ofpustules,
papules,nodules,tumors,raining tracts,chronic ulcerations,orplaques.
MATERIALs:Cotton-tipped applicatorssyringes,22-,23-,or25-gaugeneedles,
glassmirosopeeoveicrosopeamairantruhandar
ious stainsareneeded.
PROCEDUREs-SAMPLE CoLLECTION:Several techniquesmaybe used to obtain
samples.The bestprocedure may depend on the type and location of thelesion.
Samplesmaybecollected by 1)fine-needle aspiration ofcells ormaterial from le-
sions;2)fine-needlebiopsyofvariouslesions;3)impression smearsmadefromthe
surface of intactlesions;4)impression smearsmade from cutsurfaces of surgically

excised lesions (e.g.,nodules or tumors); and 5) impression smears made after lanc
ing papules,pustules, or other lesions.
Fine-needle aspiration:
Many combinations of needles and syringesmay beused to perform this procedure.
Smaller needle and syringe combinations are used for softer tissues to be aspirated.
The authors prefer a 23-gaugeneedle attached to a3-cc syringe or a 22-gauge nee-
dle attached to a 6-cc syringe.Regardless of the combination used,the needle is
carefully inserted into the center of thelesion.The plunger is pulled back1-2mls
(or a comparableamount with larger syringes)to provide negative pressure within
the syringe.The negative pressure is released and the needle may be redirected
within thelesion and the process repeated.The negative pressure is completely re-
leasedbefore withdrawing theneedle from the lesion so that the collected sample
will remain within the needle or needle hub.The needle is then detached from the
syringe and air is drawn into the syringe.The needle is then replaced onto the sy-
ringe and the contents are expelled onto a clean microscope slide.The procedure
mayberepeatedtocollectmaterialfromvariousareasofthelesionifitisarge
enough.An adequate sample maybe collected from some tissues without the use of
anynegative pressure orvacuum,simplybyinserting theneedleinto thelesionand
then withdrawingit.This procedure works best for nodules,tumors,and for ob-
taining samples for lymph node cytology.
Fine-needlebiopsy:
A 22- or 23-gauge needle is attached to a flexible intravenous infusion line or sy-
ringe pre-filled with35ml of air.Needleswith stylets are not necessary,although
the authorusesastyletwhenpenetratingthethoracicwallduringaspiration/biopsy
of pulmonary masses.In dermatology cases,the tissue tobe sampled is immobilized
with one hand and the needle is rapidly inserted into the lesion and then moved
rapidlyback and forth with long strokes about 5-8 times.The needle tip should re-
main within thelesion.The contents of the needle are expelled immediately onto a
glass slide and then spread over the slideas describedbelow.It isimportanttohave
all the necessarymaterials at hand when performing this technique.The slide
should NOT be allowed to dry.This technique works very well for solid masses and
lymphnodes.
Surface impression smears(touchimprints):
In somecases,direct smearsmay bemadefrom the surface of the skin.Thisproce
dure is also knowas aTzanck preparation.A clean glass slide is firmly pressed onto
the skinlesion.When makingtouchimprints from the cut surface of a biopsy spec
imen,it isuseful togentlyblot excess blood from the surface of thelesion usinga
drypaper towel before making the imprint.Examination gloves should be worn to
prevent the clinician from contaminating the slidewith fingerprints,which can oc-
casionally confuse the reader of the slide.If a copious amount of materialis de-
positedonto theslide,itmayneedtobe distributedusingoneof thetechniques as
described under Techniques of Slide Separation on the next page. Otherwise,the
sample is allowed to dry for staining.This procedure works best for ulcers or
plaques (e.g., eosinophilic plaque).It is important to consider that imprints made
from the surface of the skin may only reflectchanges or pathology on the surface
and may miss underlying,deeper abnormalities (e.g.,ulcerated neoplasticlesions).
Collecting the samplefrom a pustule or papule:
Thesurface of thelesion should be gently cleanedwitha surgical scrubsolution or
alcohol, being careful not to rupture the lesion. If the lesion appears to be excep-
PracticalCytology
tionallyfriable,thelesionmaybegentlywipedoncewithalcoholandthenallowed
to dry before proceeding.Using a sterile injection needle,the lesion is carefully
lanced to expose the contents.In some cases (e.g.,large pustules),a sufficient
amount of exudate may be collected (i.e.,scooped) onto the needle for placement
on the slide.Inmost cases,a cleanmicroscope slideis pressed against the open le
siontocollecttheexudate.Careshouldbetakento avoid contaminatingtheslide
with material from the adjacent areas of the skin.Aswith other techniques,the ex
udate（e.g.,blood,cellularmaterial,pus) should be quickly spreadover the slde
(seetechniquesdescribed below)before the exudate dries.
TECHNIQUESOFSLIDEPREPARATION:

specimen on one end of a glass slide and then gently placing a second slide on the
specimen ataright angle to thefirst slide.Theweight of thesecondslidegenerally
applies enoughcompression of thesample,and the top slidegently slides off the

Thebrush techriqueallowsformoredelicatedistributionof thecells andfluid

spread out (i.e.,“painted")on the slide using a camel hair artist's brush (Fig.1-2).
Thebrush is then rinsed well with tap water and dried after each use.This tech-
niquegives singlecell layerdistibutionontheslidewithaminimumof trauma o

used to accomplish the same task,though there ismore trauma to thecells.
Slides should thenbefixed and stained.Heatfixing the slidewitha match or
lighter is beneficialwhen the slide containswaxy orgreasy exudate,such as seen
with most ear swabs orwith impressionsfrom seborrheicpatients.Otherwise,the
alcohol-based fixative used inmost stainingprocedures is adequate.One slide

MATeAs:Forceps,fungalculture media,lass lides,stains,cover slps,la

culture andmore information on thatprocedureis discussed laterin thisbook.
PRoceDuRE:Asmall amountofhyphaeshouldbegentlyremovedfromtheculture

inedmicroscopically and thefungusidentified.
Thehyphae shouldbeexaminedunder scanning(2-4Xobjectives)and high dry
magnifications tolookfor thecharacteristics of thecommon pathogenic orsapro-
phytic fungi.Several excellent reference texts have diagrams and photographs of
theidentifyingtraits of thevariousfungi.It isnot clinically essential to determine
which pathogenispresent,but it isnecessary toseparate a pathogenfrom a sapro-
phytic organism.
Anothertechniquetodistribute hyphae ontoaslideforexaminationinvolvesthe
useof a piece of clear acetate tape,whichis touched to the surfaceof thefungal
colony on the culture medium.A drop of stain (e.g.,newmethylene blue or lac-
tophenol cotton blue)isplaced on the slide,the tape pressed onto the slide,fol-
lowed bya drop ofimmersionoil andacover slip overthe drop oil.Theresulting
“sandwich"of stain-tape with fungal elements-oil-cover slip allows the slideto be

There areanumber of cutaneous disordersforwhich the biopsy is the only helpful

SITE SELECTION
It is often difficult to decide which area to biopsy.We have been taught to sample
theperiphery of thelesionso thatbothnormaland abnormalareaswillbe available
for inspection.This is a problem in many cases,and may facilitate a poor section
when only a small portion of the pathologyispresent in the tissue.Itismore pro
ductive to chooserepresentative lesions and submit multiple pieces of skin for eval-
uation.Most laboratorieswill allow the clinician to submit up tofour orfive sec-
tionsofskinforthesamefee,asmultiplesectionswill aid thepathologistinmaking
a diagnosis.Remember,if thelesion ispresent on the planum nasale then submit a
section of theplanum nasale,not the surroundingskin.Although the area bleeds
quiteprofuselywhencut,it healsnicelywithminimalscarring andincreases thelike
lihood of an accurate diagnosis.The following “rules”apply to the question of
Where to biopsy:
1. Choose several representative lesions as they may represent various stages of
the same disorder ormultiple problems.
2.Inlude lesions characterized by scale,crust,erythema,rosion,ulceration,t.
(Fig.2-1A-C)
3.It is not always necessary tobiopsy the edge of a lesion,although a sample
taken within the center of an ulcer is rarely diagnostic.
4.Pustules and vesicles should not be biopsied with a punch technique because
the twistingmotion of the punchwill rupture orremovetheroof of thelesion
and disrupt the architecture of the sample;theselesions shouldbeexcised in
toto.
5.Ulcers or deep draining lesions are best taken by excision,rather than by
punch technique,because the twistingmotion may separate thepathologic
tissue from the more normal tissue,leaving important clues behind(i.e,
vasculitis,panniculitis,etc.).
6.Do not be afraid tobiopsy a footpad or the planum nasalewedge samples
are easier to close than circular punched samples.
7.Crusted lesions are good sites forbiopsy.Remember,if the crust separates
from thelesion during samplingbe sure to includeit in theformalin jar and
make a notation for the technician to “please cut in the crust."
8.Heavily scaled areas are often good diagnostic sites.
BIOPSYTECHNIQUE
One of themost important points toremember is that cutaneous biopsy sites should
not be scrubbed and cleaned,as this will remove clues regarding the diagnosis.It is
oftendifficultforveterinarians to feel comfortable cutting through crust andscale
without scrubbing the area.Most cutaneous biopsies can be done with local anes.
thesia vialidocaine injection into the subcutaneous region.(Fig.2-2A,B)Some frac-
tious animals may need a sedative (such as ketamine/valium).Avoid the 2- and 4-
mm punches because the sections are too small for good sample size.The following
“rules”apply to the question of
How to biopsy:
1.Never scrub or cleanse the area before excision--the surface crust may contain
the pathologic changes necessary to make a diagnosis.
2.Use a surgical blade to obtain a wedge-shaped or elliptic biopsy specimen
whensectioning thenose,footpad,vesicles,bullae,ordeeplesions(vasculitis,
panniculitis,etc.).

Therapeutics
·Therapy is limited for many of these disorders.
Behavioral modification or application of a T-shirt may help prevent self-bar-
bering.
Removal of an offending dietary item may alleviate the symptoms of food al-
lergy.
·If the pet is compliant,shampoo and topical therapy may help secondary
problems,such as hyperkeratosis in sebaceous adenitis,crusting in demodi
cosis,secondary bacterial infections,and malodorfor greasy conditions.
DRUGS OF CHOICE
·Obsessive compulsive disorder—amitriptyline (10 mg/cat/day for a 21-day
trial)
·Endocrine alopecia(males)--testosterone supplementation
Allergic dermatitisantihistamines,diet,corticosteroids，hyposensitization
vaccine
·Hyperthyroidism—oral medications such as methimazole (tapazole)or ra-
dioactive iodine therapy
·Diabetes mellitus--regulation of glucose levels (insulin)
·Hyperadrenocorticism—-surgery; no known effective medical therapy
·Paraneoplastic alopeciano therapy;often fatal
·Epidermotropiclymphoma—retinoids (isotretinoin),corticosteroids,inter-
feron
Sebaceous adenitis-retinoids,corticosteroids
·Squamous cell carcinoma in situ—surgical excision,retinoids (topical and
oral)
·Alopecia areata—no therapy; possibly counterirritants
·Demodicosis-lime sulfur dips at weekly intervals for 4-6 dips;Mitaban and
ivermectin have been tried with variable success (dose and frequency of ap-
plication are questionable)
·Dermatophytosis—griseofulvin (CAUTION: idiosyncratic toxicity),ketocona-
zole,itraconazole(best choice),lym dip,lufenuron
Comments
Dermatophytosis-can cause skinlesions in humans
PREGNANCY
Retinoids andgriseofulvin should not be administered to pregnant animals.

Daniel O.Morris
Definition
A heterogenousgroup of skin disorders characterized by disruption of the epider-
mis(erosions)or,if thebasement membrane is compromised,the epidermis and
dermis(ulcers)
Pathophysiology
Varieswidely,depending on the cause；may include congenital or developmerital
disorders that compromise tissue cohesion;cell-mediated (inflammatory or neo-
plastic)injury;anoxicinjury;destructionby trauma,toxins,irritants,contactants,
microbialorganisms,orparasiticmigration;andantigen-specific autoimmune dis-
orders
Signalment/History
Age,breed,and sexpredispositionsvary accordingto thediseasein question.
·History andphysicalexamination are especiallyimportant owingto theex
tensive differential list.
·Ascertain history of pruritus(self-induced ulcers or erosions),exposure to in-
fectiousorganismstravelhstory(for somefungaldiseases）,diet,and signs
of systemic disease.

Skin scrapings-suspected parasitism
·Direct impression cytology (Tzanck prep)-identify acantholytic cells if pem-
phigus is suspected
·Fine needle aspirate with cytology-indurated or nodular lesions
·Bacterial (aerobic and anaerobic),mycobacterial,and/or fungal cultures-
suspected infectious disease (especially in cats with ulcers or draining tracts)
·Skinbiopsy for histopathologymost informative test;for cavitary lesions.

Definition/Overview
Excessive production or abnormal shedding of epidermal cellsresulting in the clin-
ical presentation of cutaneous scaling(See flowchart onpage 80)
Pathophysiology/Etiology
An increaseintheproduction,a decreasen thedequamation,oraninrease
in the cohesion ofkeratinocytesresultsin abnormal shedding ofepidermal
cells individually (fine scale) and in sheets (coarse scale).
Primary exfoliative disorders-keratinization defects,in which the genetic
control of epidermal cell proliferation andmaturation is abnormal (via en-
zyme abnormalities,etc.)
·Secondaryexfoliative disorders--from theeffects of disease states on thenor-
malmaturation andproliferation ofepidermalcells
Signalment/History
·Primary-apparent by 2years of age;characteristic in afected breeds (see
Causes)
·Secondary-any age;any breed of dog or cat

·Miscellaneous-any disease process mayresult in excessive scale formation
owingtometabolicdyscrasiaorcutaneousinflammation
Diagnostics
CBC/BIOCHEMISTRY/URINALYSIS
·Normal with primary keratinization disorders
·Mild,nonregenerative anemia andhypercholesterolemia are consistentwith
hypothyroidism.
Neutrophilia,monocytosis,eosinopenia,lymphopenia,elevatedserumalka
line phosphatase,hypercholesterolemia,and hyposthenuria suggest hypera
drenocorticism.
OTHER LABORATORY TESTS
Thyroid hormone levels and adrenal function tests if an endocrinopathy is sus
pected;see specific chapters for test recommendations
DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
·Skin scrapings-diagnose ectoparasitism
·Skin biopsyrule out particular differential diagnoses; strongly recom-
mended for most cases
·Intradermal skin testing--identify atopy
·Food-elimination trial--identify foodallergy
·Epidermal exudate preparations-determine type ofmicroflora on the skin
Therapeutics
·Frequent and appropriate topical therapy-cornerstone ofproper treatment
·Underbathing,rather than overbathing,is a common error.
·Diagnose and control all treatable primary and secondary diseases.
·Recurrence of secondary pyoderma may require repeated therapy and further
diagnostics.
·Maintaining control is often lifelong.
DRUGS OF CHOICE
Shampoos
·Contact time—5-15 min required;>15 min discouraged,because it results in
epidermalmaceration,loss ofbarrierfunction,andexcessive epidermal drying
·Hypoallergenic (soap free)—useful only in mild cases of dry scale and to
maintain secondary exfoliation after theprimary disease has been controlled
·Sulfur/salicylic acidkeratolytic,keratoplastic,and bacteriostatic;an excel-
lent first choice for the moderately scaly patient;not overly drying
·Benzoyl peroxidestronglykeratolytic,antimicrobial,andfollicleflushing;
bacterial infection and/or extreme greasiness
Ethyl lactate-less effective than benzoyl peroxidefor follicularflushing and
antimicrobial activity,butnotasirritating or drying;most useful formoder-
atepyoderma anddryscale
82
The 5-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion
Tarkeratolytic,keratoplastic,and antipruritic; degreasing,but less so than
benzoyl peroxide;use for moderate scale associated with pruritus
Moisturizers
Excellent for restoring skin hydration frequent shampooing may result inex-
cessive dryness and discomfort) and increasing effectiveness of subsequent
shampoos
·Humectants-encourage hydration of the stratum corneum by attracting wa-
ter from the dermis; at high concentrations may bekeratolytic
·Microencapsulation-recent advances may improve the residual activity of
moisturizers by permitting sustained release after bathing
·Emollients-coat the skin; smooth the roughened surfaces produced by ex-
cessive scaling; usually combined with occlusives to encourage hydration of
the epidermis
SystemicTherapy
Specific causes require specific treatments (i.e. thyroxinereplacement for hy-
pothyroidism; zinc supplements for zinc-responsive dermatosis).
·Systemic antibiotics-always indicated for secondary pyoderma
·Retinoid drugsvaried success for idiopathic or primary seborrhea;reports
of individual response to retinoids(especially cocker spanielswith a primary
keratinization defect);generally,topical therapy provides more benefits for
dogs than does retinoid administration;vitamin A analogues (etretinate, so-
riatane,and isotretinoin)used inlimited studies;vitaminDanalogues arecur-
rently being evaluated for use in keratinization defects
PRECAUTIONS
·Corticosteroids-maybe used judiciously to control the inflammation result
ing from many exfoliative disorders;will mask signs of pyoderma and pre-
vent accurate diagnosis of primary disease
VitaminAandD analoguessideeffectscan be severe;thus,patients should be
referred to a dermatologist beforebeing treated with these experimental drugs
Comments
PATIENTMONITORING
·Antibiotics and topical therapy-recheck every 3 weeks tomonitor response;
patients may respond differently to the various topical therapies
·Seasonal changes,development of additional diseases (especially cutaneous
hypersensitivity),and recurrence of pyoderma-may cause previously con-
trolled patients to worsen; re-evaluation critical for determining if new fac-
tors are involved and if changes in therapy arenecessary
·Endocrinopathies-after pill administration (routine 46-hr)thyroid moni-
toring orACTH-stimulation testsshould beused forpropermanagement
·Autoimmune disordersre-evaluate frequently during the initial phase of induc
tion;less often after remission; clinicalevaluation and laboratory data required
ZOONOTICPOTENTIAL
Dermatophytosis and several ectoparasites have either zoonotic potential or the
ability to produce human lesions.
ExfoliativeDermatoses
83
PREGNANCY
·Sulfonamide antibiotics and chloramphenicoldo not use inpregnant ani
mals
Systemic retinoids andvitaminAin therapeutic dosages-donot use in intact
females,because of severe andpredictable teratogenicity and the extremely
longwithdrawalperiod
SYNONYMS
Keratinization disorders-seborrhea,idiopathic seborrhea,keratinization defect,

Actinic conditions-seen more frequently in outdoor, short-haired dogs liv-
ing in areas with ample sunlight
Diagnostics
CBC/BIOCHEMISTRY/URINALYSIS
·Should be withinnormal range in most patients
·A circulating eosinophiliamay be present with sterile eosinophilic pustulosis.
DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
·Skin scrapings--identify possibleDemodex mites or rhabditiform larvae
·Dermatophyte cultures-identify possible dermatophytosis
Tzanck preparations-determine if bacteria and degenerative neutrophils are
present；; compatible with bacterial folliculitis;
cosinophils indicate
eosinophilic pustulosis or furunculosis is more likely.
Skin biopsy--if none of these tests has revealed a definitive diagnosis or the
lesions are nonresponsive to conventional therapy
Therapeutics
·For nearly all causes,animal can be treated as an outpatient.
·Generalized demodicosis and secondary sepsis require hospitalization.
·Alteration of activity or diet should not be necessary.
DRUGS OF CHOICE
Bacterial Folliculitis
·Superficial pyoderma—appropriate antibiotics based on bacterial culture and
·Deep pyoderma-appropriate antibiotics based on bacterial culture and sen-
sitivity should be given for 6-8weeks or more
Sebaceous Adenitis
·A50-75%mixture of propylene glycol and water once daily as a spray to af-
fected areas or bathing and soaking in baby oil weekly
·Essential fatty acid dietary supplements (PO q12h) in addition to evening
primroseoil(500 mgPOq12h)
·Refractory cases-isotretinoin (1 mg/kg PO q12-24h);if response is seen,ta-
per dosage(1 mg/kg q48h or0.5mg/kg q24h)
·Cyclosporine has also been used (5 mg/kg PO q12h).
·Most cases are refractory to corticosteroids.
86
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsult Clinical Companion
Canine Acne
·May resolve without therapy in mild cases
·More severe cases--benzoyl peroxide shampoos and gels every 24 hr until le-
sions resolve; then as needed
zoyl peroxide therapies
·Recurrent or very deep infection (furunculosis)-systemic antibiotics and
warm water soaks
Very refractory cases-topical tretinoin(q12h)or isotretinoin(1-2mg/kgPO
q24h)
Feline Acne
·Underlying cause should be sought and treated accordingly
·No underlying cause foundStri-Dex pads or benzoyl peroxide gels used
daily or alternated daily
·Cats can be sensitive to the irritant effects of benzoyl peroxide
·Refractory cases—try systemic antibiotics
RhabditicDermatitis
Remove and destroy bedding.
Wash kennels,beds, and cages and treat with a premise insecticide or flea spray.
·Bathe affected animal and remove crusts.
·Parasiticidal dipat least 2 times at weekly intervals
·Severe infectionantibiotics may be necessary
Actinic Conditions
·Sunlight—avoid between 10 A.M.and 4 P.M.; apply sunscreen with an SPF ≥
15 every 12 hr
·Severeinflammation-topical or systemic corticosteroidsmayprovide com
fort;topical,12.5%hydrocortisone usually sufficient;systemic,prednisone
(initially,1 mg/kgPO for3-5 days)
·Secondary infection-antibiotics may be necessary
·Squamous cell carcinoma—prognosis is guarded to poor,depending on the
stage of the disease; therapy includes synthetic retinoids,hyperthermia,
cryosurgery,photochemotherapy,radiationtherapy,and surgicalexcision
Other
·Dermatophytosis-see specific chapter
·Sterile eosinophilic pustulosis-prednisolone/prednisone (2.2-4.4mg/kg
q24h; then taper to an alternate-day low dosage)
·Kerion—see Dermatophytosis
·Demodicosis--see specific chapter
CONTRAINDICATIONS
dermatophytosis,kerions,anddemodicosis.
PRECAUTIONS
·Fatty acids-use with caution in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease or re-
currentbouts ofpancreatitis
Papular andNodularDermatoses
87
·Isotretinoinmay cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca,hyperactivity,ear pruri
tus,erythematousmucocutaneous junction,lethargy with vomiting,abdom-
inal distension anderythema,anorexiawithlethargy,collapse,andswollen
tongue; CBC and chemistry screen abnormalities include high platelet count,
hypertriglyceridemia,hypercholesterolemia,andhighalaninetransaminase
·Cyclosporinemay cause vomiting and diarrhea,gingival hyperplasia,B-lym-
phocytehyperplasiahirsutism,papillomatous skinlesions,andhighincidenc
of infection; potential toxic reactions include nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity
Comments
PATIENT MONITORING
·CBC,chemistry screen,andurinalysis-monitor monthly for 4-6months in
patientsreceiving cyclosporine or syntheticretinoid therapy
·Tear production-monitor monthly for 4-6 months,then every 6months in
patientsreceiving syntheticretinoid therapy
·Skin scrapings-monitor therapy in patients with demodicosis (see Demodi-
cosis)
·Repeat fungal cultures-monitor therapy in patients with dermatophytosis
(seeDermatophytosis)
·Resolution of lesions-monitor progress of sebaceous adenitis,actinic condi
tions,and all other diseases
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Actinic conditions may progress to squamous cell carcinoma.
ZOONOTICPOTENTIAL
Dermatophytosiscontagious tohumans in30-50%of cases of Microsporum canis
PREGNANCY
Synthetic retinoidsvery teratogenic; do not use in pregnant animals,ani-
mals intended for reproduction, or intact animals; should not be used by

NURSING CARE
Foot soaks,hot packing,and/orbandaging may be necessary,depending on cause.
DIET
Hypoallergenic diet-determine food hypersensitivity
CLIENT EDUCATION
·Depends on underlying cause and severity of condition
·Discuss husbandry，lifestyle,and preventative medical practices.
·For allergic,immune-mediated,or endocrine causes,clientmust understand
that condition will be managed, not cured.
SURGICALCONSIDERATIONS
·Melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas--very poor prognosis;early diag
nosisnecessitatesremoval of the digit,digits,orpaw
·Infectious-may benefit from surgical debridement of devitalized tissue be
foremedical therapy
DRUGS OF CHOICE
·Long-term antibiotics,antifungals,anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
levels of corticosteroids,chemotherapeutic agents,hormone-replacement
therapy,or zinc supplementation
·Depend on the underlying cause and secondary infections
Comments
PATIENT MONITORING
Depends on the underlying cause and treatment protocol selected
PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE
·Environmental cause-good husbandry and preventative medical practices
should avoid recurrence
·Allergic causeimportant to avoid the allergen (inhalant or food), if possible
EXPECTED COURSEANDPROGNOSIS
·Success of therapy depends on finding the underlying cause; often the cause
is unknown; even when the cause isknown,management can be frustrating
owing to relapses or lack of affordable therapeutics.
·Often the disease can only be managed and not cured.
·Surgical intervention is sometimes the only option.

Nail and Nailbed Disorders
121
Comments
·Trauma or neoplasia often affects a single nail.
·Involvement of multiple nails suggests a systemic disease.
·Immune-mediated diseases (except lupoid onychodystrophy） usually have
other skin lesions in addition to nail/nailfold lesions.
·Paronychia (infectious)—immunosuppression (endogenous or exogenous),
FeLVinfection,trauma,and diabetesmellitus
·Bacterial onychomadesis-—excessively short nail trimming(into the quick)
EXPECTED COURSE AND PROGNOSIS
·Bacterial orfungalparonychia and onychomycosis-treatment maybepro-
longed andresponse may be influenced by underlying immunosuppressive
factors
·Onychomycosis and onychorrhexis-may require amputation of the third
phalanxforresolution
·Nail dystrophy—prognosis is good when underlying cause can be effectively
treated(e.g.,hyperthyroidism,zinc-responsive dermatosis)
·Onychomadesisprognosis depends on underlying cause; immune-mediated
diseases and vascular problems carry a more guarded prognosis than do
trauma or infectious causes
·Neoplasiasome can be totally excised or removed by amputation of the
digit; others are highly malignant and may have already spread by the time of
diagnosis

is a folliculitis,perifolliculitis,and pyogranulomatous dermatitisif the olli
cles haveruptured
·Skin scrapingsidentify parasites (demodicosis),pelodera, or fungi (der-
matophytosis)
·Fecal flotation--identifyhookworm ova
·Cytologic examination of the exudate withWright-Giemsa stain-identify
yeast,bacteria,and (rarely) parasites; evaluate the type of inflammatory re-
·Culture-bacterial and fungal
Therapeutics
·Treatments are directed at an underlying cause,if determined.
·Ifabacterial causeissuspected,thenstart immediate treatmentwithabroad
spectrum antibiotic while pending culture and sensitivity results (i.e., amoxi-
cillin with clavulanate or cephalosporins).
·Antibiotic therapy mustbeused foran extended period of time(minimum of
6-8 weeks).
·Most infections are gram-positive Stapbylococcus intermedius yet gram
negative infectionsmay alsooccur (e.g.,Pseudomonas）and may be difficult
to control.

·Choice ofantibiotic depends on sensitivity:frequent options with good clin-
icalresultsinclude cephalosporins,fluoroquinolones,dicloxacillin,carbeni-
cillin, ciprofloxacin, etc.
·Draining lesions-twice-daily foot soaks with amild astringent such as Bur-
rows solution(10-15minutes)
·Shampooing the feet daily with a benzoyl peroxideproduct is often very help
ful.
·Topical therapywithmupirocin ointment or benzoyl peroxidegel tid
·Maybe beneficial to restrict activity or protect the feet
·Severe refractory casesmay require surgical debridement and removal of the
interdigital web(fusion podoplasty).
Comments
·Rifampin-use with caution for short periods(30-60 days)at 5-10 mg/kg
q24h;penetrates deep lesions well owing to its lipid solubility;must be ac
companied by a good antibiotic,because bacteria rapidly develop resistance
·Monitor liver enzymes and CBC every 2 weeks.
·Do not use with liver disease.
·Stimulates liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism and thus can influence
the metabolism of concurrently administered drugs;concentrations of anti-
coagulants,digioxin,corticosteroids,and other drugs become subtherapeu-
tic.
·When rifampin and ketoconazole are administered concurrently,both drugs
aresubtherapeutic.
●Use caution when concurrently administering other drugs.
·Monitor closely to detect the underlying cause; though often tedious,it is es-
sentialforcompleteresolution and healing.
·Medication should be continuedfor extendedperiodsof time; 6-8weeks is
oftentheminimum.
·Because of extensive furunculosis the lesions are often markedly granuloma-
tous.This granulation tissue tends to “wall off” the bacteria and “protect”
the organisms from antibiotics.Rifampin has the ability to penetrate granu-
lation tissue and may be an adjunct to therapy.

the planum nasale or mucocutaneous junctions (eyes,mouth,etc.).
·Nasal pyoderma is often very acute in onset and may be quite painful.
·A cutaneous biopsy is often necessary in cases of nasal dermatosis.Remem-
ber,if the lesion occurs ontheplanum nasale thenyou mustbiopsy the actual
tissue and not the skin around the nose to obtain an accurate diagnosis.

Definition/Overview
·Otis externa-inflammation of the external ear canal
·Otitismedia-inflammationofthemiddleear
The terms arenot diagnosticbut descriptions of clinical signs.
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Otitis externa-chronicinflammationresults in alterationsin thenormalen-
vironment of the canal;theexternal earcanal is linedwithepithelium con-
taining modified apocrine(cerumen)glands;the glands enlarge and produce
excessivewax;the epidermis and dermis thicken and become fibrotic;thick-
ened canal foldseffectively reduce canal width;calcification ofauricular car-
tilage is the end-stageresult.
·Otitis media-often an extension of otitis externa through a ruptured tym-
panum;may occur without a membrane beingruptured;can occur from
polypsorneoplasiawithin themiddleear

·Stenosisoftheexternal earcanaliscommoninsharpeis.
144
OtitisExterna and Media
145
HISTORICAL FINDINGS
·Pain
Head shaking
·Scratching at the pinnae
·Malodorous ears
RISK FACTORS
·Abnormal or breed-related conformation of the external canal(e.g., stenosis,
hirsutism, and pendulous pinnae) restricts proper air flow into the canal.
·Excessive moisture (e.g., from swimming or frequent cleanings） can lead to
infection; overzealous client compliance with recommendations forear clean-
ings common
Topical drugreaction and irritation and trauma from abrasive cleaning tech
niques
·Underlying systemic diseases produce abnormalities in the environment and
ear canal immune response.
Clinical Features
·Otitis externa-often a secondary symptom of anunderlying disease
·Infection-purulent and malodorous exudate
·Inflammationexudation,pain,pruritus,and erythema
Chronic otitis externa (dogs)—results in tympanic membrane rupture(71%)
and otitis media (82%)
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS
Redness and swelling of the external canal,leading to stenosis
·Scaling and exudation-may result in malodor and canal obstruction
Cats-hold the pinna down or tilt thehead
Vestibular signswith head tilt,nystagmus,anorexia,ataxia,and infrequen
vomiting)indicate development of otitis media/interna.
Differential Diagnosis
PRIMARY CAUSES
·Parasites (otitis externa)Otodectes cynotis,Demodex spp.,Sarcoptes and
Notoedres,and Otobius megnini
·Hypersensitivitiesatopy,foodallergy,contact allergy,and systemicorlocal
drug reaction (Fig. 14-1)
·Foreign bodies—plant awns
·Obstructionsneoplasia,polyps,cerumen gland hyperplasia,and accumula
tion of hair; may also be a secondary event
·Keratinization disorders and increased cerumen production-functional ob-
struction of the ear canal (Fig.14-2)
Autoimmune diseases--frequently affect the pinnae; sometimes affect the ex
ternal ear canal

DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
·Skin scrapings from the pinna-parasites
·Skinbiopsy-autoimmune disease,neoplasia,or cerumen gland hyperplasia
Culture ofexudate-often reserve forresistant infection,cytology oftenmore
important
·Microscopic examination of auralexudate-singlemost important diagnos-
tictoolaftercompleteexaminationof theearcanal
·Appearance of the exudate-yeast infectionscommonly produce ayellow-tan
thickexudate;bacterial infections commonlyproducea brownish-black thin
exudate;however,appearance does not allow an accurate diagnosis of the
type of infection;microscopicexamination necessary
·Infectionswithin the canal can change with prolonged or recurrent therapy;
repeat examination of aural exudate is required in chronic cases.

OtitisExterna and Media
149
MicroscopicExamination
·Preparations-make from both canals(the contents of the canals may not be
the same); spread samples thinly on aglass microscope slide;examine both
unstained and modifiedWright-stained samples.
·May need to heat-fix sample if the exudate is very waxy
·Mites-presumptive diagnosis
·Type(s) of bacteria or yeast-—assist in the choice of therapy (Fig. 14-5)
·Findings (types of organisms;WBCs)note in the record;rank the number
of organisms and cell types on a scale of O-4 to allow treatment monitoring
·WBCs within the exudate-active infection; systemic antibiotic therapy may
be warranted
Therapeutics
DIET
No restrictions unless a food allergy is suspected
CLIENT EDUCATION
Teach clients,by demonstration,the proper method for cleaning ears
SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Indicated when the canal is severely stenotic or obstructed or when neoplasia
or a polyp is diagnosed
·Severe,unresponsive otitis media may require a bullae osteotomy.
DRUGS OF CHOICE
Systemic
·Antibioticsuseful in severe cases of bacterial otitis externa;mandatory
when the tympanum hasruptured;trimethoprim-potentiated sulfonamides
(dosage varies by preparation),cephalexin(25mg/kg q8-12h),enrofloxacin
(2.5 mg/kg q12h),or clindamycin (10 mg/kg q12h)
·Antifungals-use with overwhelming yeast or fungal infection; ketoconazole
(5-10 mg/kgq12h)
·Corticosteroids-reduce swelling andpain;anti-inflammatory dosages of
prednisone(0.25-0.5 mg/kgq12h);use sparingly and for short durations
only
·Ivermectin-various external ear parasites;300μg/kg SCweekly for 4weeks

Topical
·Topical therapy paramount for resolution and control of otitis externa
·First,completely clean the external ear canal of debris;completeflushing un-
dergeneral anesthesiareserved foruncooperative patients or severe cases,in-
cluding otitis media.
Second,thoroughly clean the ear daily during initial therapy,then every37

The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsult Clinical Companion
·Not recommended-combination ointments (e.g.,Otomax,Panalog,Li-
quachlor),which often accumulate andperpetuate the condition
·Recommended—antibacterial (e.g-,gentocin)or antiyeast drops (micona-
zole), with or without corticosteroid; commercial ear cleansers with ceru-
menolytics,antiseptics,andastringents;Aloceticforroutine cleaning orwhen
the competence of the tympanic membrane is inquestion;chlorhexidine-con-
taining solutions (e.g., Chlorhexiderm Flush,Hexadene Flush) for more se-
vere cases when the tympanic membrane is intact (controversial)
·Cerumenolytics-dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate or carbamide peroxide;
emulsify wax,facilitatingremoval
·Antiseptics—acetic acid or chlorhexidine gluconate;reduce or eliminate in-
fectious organisms
·Astringentsisopropyl alcohol,boric acid,or salicylic acid;reduce moisture
·Antibiotics,antifungals,and/or parasiticidesuse only when presence of or
ganism(s)hasbeen confirmed.
·Ivermectineffective for ear mites in cats,but recurrence rates higher than
with other parasiticides;use only for large numbers of animals (kennels） or
when a persistent carrier state is suspected
·Resistance to medications-perform a culture and sensitivity of the aural ex-
udate;recently,suspensions of silver sulfadiazine and of enrofloxacin have
beenshown tobeeffective
·Generally,ingredients shouldbe limited to those needed to treat a specific in-
fection (i.e., antibiotics only for a bacterial infection).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
·Ivermectinnot FDA approved for treating ear mites;client disclosure and
consent are paramount before administration; herding breeds(dogs)have in-
creased sensitivity and should not be treated with this drug
·Ruptured tympanum-use caution with topical cleansers and medications
other than sterilesaline or dilute aceticacid;potential for ototoxicityis a con-
cern; controversial
Comments
·Use extreme caution when cleaning the external ear canals of all animals with
severe and chronic otitis externa,because the tympanum can easily be rup-
tured.
·Postflushing vestibular complications are common in cats,although usually
temporary; warn clients of possible complications and residual effects.
·Several topical medications infrequently induce contact irritation or allergic
response; re-evaluate all worsening cases.
·Uncontrolled otitis externa can lead to otitis media,deafness,vestibular dis
ease,cellulitisfacialervearalysirogressiontotitisintrna,ndrarly,
meningoencephalitis.
·Otitis externawith proper therapy,most cases resolve in 34 weeks; failure
Perpetuating factors(e.g., stenosis of the ear canal and calcification of the au-
ricular cartilage) will not resolve and may result in recurrence
·Otitis mediamay take 6+weeks of systemic antibiotics until all signs have
resolved and the tympanicmembrane hashealed

·Head tilt
Patientmaylean,veer,orroll toward thesideaffectedwith peripheral vestbu-
litis.
·Vestibular deficits-maybe transient and episodic
·Bilateral involvement—may note wide head excursions,truncal ataxia,and
deafness
·Vomiting and nausea—may occur during the acute phase
·Facial nerve damage-saliva and food dropping from the corner of themouth;
an inability to blink; ocular discharge
●Anisocoria and/or protrusion of the third eyelid (Horners syndrome) may be
noted.
RISK FACTORS
·Nasopharyngeal polyps and inner,middle,or uter earneoplasiamay pre-
dispose patient to bacterial infection
·Vigorous ear flush
·Ear cleaning solutions (e.g., chlorhexidine)—may be irritating to the middle
and inner ear; avoid if the tympanum is ruptured

The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinical Companion
·Topicalwater-based orophthalmic antibiotic solutions-chloramphenicol or
a triple antibiotic preparation preferred
·Antibiotics——long-term (6-8weeks);broad-spectrum systemic agents; select
on basis of culture and sensitivity,if available
·Penicillinase-resistant penicillin and cephalosporins—good initial drugs
·Ruptured tympanum or associated neurologic deficits-avoid oil-based orir-
ritating external ear preparations (e.g., chlorhexidine)and aminoglycosides,
which are toxic to inner ear structures
·Otitis media or interna—topical and systemic corticosteroids contraindi-
cated;may exacerbate the signs associated with infection
Comments
·Avoid rigorously flushing the external ear;may result in or exacerbate signs
of otitis media or interna.
·Evaluate for resolution of signs after 10-14 days-or sooner if the patient is
deteriorating.
·Routine ear cleaning and dental prophylaxis-may reduce chances of infec-
tion
·Signs associated with vestibular and facial nerve damage or Horners syn-
drome-may remain
·Severe infections-may spread to the brainstem
·Osteomyelitis of the petrous temporal bone and middle ear cavity effusion-
commonsequela to severe,chronicinfections
·Bulla osteotomy—postoperative complications include Horners syndrome,
facialparalysis,andonset or exacerbation ofvestibular dysfunction
·Cats-consider avoiding bilateral bullae osteotomies in patients withbilateral
effusions; may be an increased incidence of death after surgery
·Otitismedia and internausually responsive tomedical management
·When medical management is ineffective,a surgical evaluation for lateral ear
resectionshould be explored.
·Vestibular signs—improvement in 2-6weeks;more rapid in small dogs and
in cats

PERIANALFISTULA
MichaelA.MitchellandJamesL.Cook
Definition/Overview
Characterized by multiple chronic fistulous tracts orulcerating sinusesinvolving
the perianalregion
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Not known;apocrine gland inflammation(hidradenitis suppurativa),im-
pactionandinfectionof theanal sinusesandcryptsinfectionof thecircum
analglands and hair follicles,and anal sacculitis have allbeen implicated.
·Anassociationwith colitis inGerman shepherd dogs hasbeen proposed.
·Thegastrointestinal systembecomesinvolvedwhen excessive scar tissue for-
mation around the anusresults in tenesmus,dyschezia,orotherproblems as
sociatedwith defecation.
·Self-mutilation can bea major problem.
·Low tail carriage and abroad tail base-proposedriskfactorspredisposing
the dogtoinflammationand infectionbecause of poorventilation,accumu-
lationoffeces,moisture,and secretions
High density of apocrine sweat glandsin the cutaneous zone of the anal canal
of German shepherd dogs
·Hidradenitis suppurativa may be associatedwith immune or endocrine dys-
function,geneticfactors,andpoor hygiene.

Perianal Fistula
161
Signalment/History
·Dogs
·German shepherd dog and Irish setter most commonly affected breeds
·Mean age, 7 years; range, 7 months to 12 years
·No gender predisposition reported;sexually intact dogs have a higherpreva-
lence
·Ageneticbasishas beenproposed but not proven.
Clinical Features
·Varywith the severity andextent of involvement
·Dyschezia
·Tenesmus
·Hematochezia
·Constipation
·Diarrhea
·Malodorous mucopurulent anal discharge
·Painful tail movements
·Licking and self-mutilation
·Reluctance to sit,posturing difficulties,and personality changes
·Fecal incontinence
·Anorexia
·Weight loss
·Perianal fistulous tracts
Differential Diagnosis
·Chronic anal sac abscess
·Perianal adenoma or adenocarcinoma with ulceration and drainage
·Rectal fistula
Diagnostics
CBC/BIOCHEMISTRY/URINALYSIS
Usuallynormal
·Patients with inflammationmay have an inflammatoryleukogram.
Diagnostic Procedures
·Presumptive diagnosis-—based on clinical signs and results of physical exam-
ination
·Definitive diagnosismade by biopsy of the affected area
·Colonoscopy with biopsy may reveal associated colitis
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsult Clinical Companion
162
Therapeutics
·Clipping hair from the affected area
·Daily antiseptic lavage
·Systemic and topicalantibiotics
·Hydrotherapy
·Elevation of the tail
·Analgesics
·Dietary modification-stool softeners if pain/tenesmus;fiber-enhanced or hy-
poallergenic diet if associated colitis/proctitis
·Postoperative nursing care may also include warm-packing the affected area.
·Surgery is considered the most effective treatment if medical therapy is un-
successful.
·Which surgical method to use is controversial;none of those currently used
consistently resolves the problem.
·Surgical options include electrosurgery,cryosurgery, surgical debridement
withfulguration by chemical cautery,exteriorizationand fulgurationbyelec-
trocautery,surgicalresection,radical excision of therectalring,tail setting,
tail amputation, and laser surgery.
·Perform anal sacculectomy with the above-selectedprocedure.
·Each technique has advantages and disadvantages that must be weighed
whenmaking a choice.
·Primary objective of surgeryis completeremoval or destruction of diseased
tissue while preserving normal tissue and function.
·Multiple procedures may be necessary for complete resolution.
DRUGS
·Cyclosporine(2-3mg/kg POq24h×12weeks)—most dogs improve;up to
50%may clear completely；50% still require surgerybecause of inadequate
clearing of fistulas or anal stricture
·Assess cyclosporine levels every 3 weeks;appropriate levels are 200-300
ng/mL,
·Unsuccessful medical treatment can be detrimental by delaying surgery.
·Antibiotics and analgesics may be indicated in some cases.
·Corticosteroids(2 mg/kg POq12h)and a hypoallergenic diet for6weeks may
yieldpartialor completeresolution (about33%ofcases);most dogs donot
improve;corticosteroid side effects are common.
Comments
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
·Recurrence

Canine and Feline Acne
165
Clinical Features
·The area may be minimally to markedly swollen with numerous erythema
tous papules.
·Advanced stages-lesions may be exudative and indicate a secondary deep
bacterial infection
·Lesionsmaybepainful on palpation
·Chronic resolved lesions may be scarred and lichenified.
·Comedones, mild erythematous papules, and serous crusts develop on the
chin and less commonly on thelips.
·Sometimes swelling of the chin
·More severe casesnodules,hemorrhagic crusts,pustules,severe erythema
alopecia,and pain
Differential Diagnosis
·Dermatophytosis
·Demodicosis
·Foreign body
·Contact dermatitis
·Malassezia infection
·Felineleprosy
·Neoplasia of the sebaceous glands and other follicular and epidermal neo-
plasia
·Allergy (including eosinophilic granuloma complex)
Diagnostics
·Bacterial culture and sensitivity testingin patients with suppurative folli-
culitis and furunculosis that areresponsive to initial antibiotic selection
Biopsy-histologic confirmation for cases in which diagnosis is in question
·Clinicalsigns andhistopathologicfindings are diagnostic.
·Initial lesions-hairless follicular papules;characterized histopathologically
bymarked follicularkeratosis,plugging,dilatation,and perifolliculitis
·Bacteriain the early stages:not seen and cannot be isolated fromlesions;as
disease progresses: papules enlarge and rupture,promoting a suppurative fol-
liculitis and furunculosis
Therapeutics
·Depends on the severity and chronicity of the disease
·Reduce behavioral trauma to the chin (e.g.,rubbing on the carpet,chewing
bones that increase salivation).
·Frequent cleaningwithbenzoyl peroxide shampoo or gel or mupirocin oint-
ment toreduce thebacterial numbers on the surface of the skin
·Instruct owners to avoid expressing the lesions,which may cause internal
ruptureof thepapuleandmassiveinflammation.
166

TOPICAL
·Benzoyl peroxide shampoo orgel (antibacterial)
·Mupirocin ointment (antibacterial-staph)
·Isotretinoin (Retin-A) or tretinoin(vitaminAacid,retinoic acid gel)may re
duce follicularkeratosis
·Corticosteroids-maybe necessary to reduce inflammation
·Other topical-clindamycin or erythromycin solution;benzamycin(benzoyl
peroxide-antibioticgel)
SYSTEMIC
·Antibiotics
appropriatefordeepbacterialinfection-especially
cephalosporins(Cephalexin,22mg/kgPO q8h for 6-8weeks)
·May need to perform bacterial culture and sensitivity test
Systemicisotretinoin--use with caution,if animal will not allow application
of topicalmedications; CAUTIoN:inform owners thatit can have potential
deleterious side effectsinhumans(druginteractions and teratogenic)if taken
bymistake;container shouldbe labeled for animal use only andkept separate
fromhuman medications toavoidaccidental use
Comments
·Benzoyl peroxidemay bleach carpets and fabrics; may be irritating
·Mupirocin ointments-greasy
·Topical retinoids-maybe drying and irritating
·Topical steroids-may cause adrenal suppression with repeated use

matitis;varying degrees of fibroplasia
Therapeutics
·Affected animal must get plenty of attention and exercise.
Diet—no modification unless an allergy is suspected
Acral LickDermatitis
171
Difficult to treat,especially if no underlying cause is found;warn owner
that patience and time are necessary.
·Surgery-do not consider until all other therapies have been exhausted;wil
often cause increased licking and attention to the affected area,resulting in
poor wound closure;if underlying causes are not addressed,recurrence is
likely.
DRUGS
Antibiotics
·Based on bacterial culture and sensitivity
Give until infection is completely resolved,often at least 6weeks.
Systemic
·Hydroxyzine HCl (1-2mg/kgPO q8h)
·Chlorpheniramine（4-8mg/dog q12h PO;maximum of0.5mg/kg q12h)
·Naltrexone (2.2mg/kg PO q12-24h)
·Amitriptyline HCl (1.1-2.2 mg/kg PO q12h);used at the lower dosage for
10 days;if no improvement,use at thehigher dosagefor10 days
·Doxepin may also be tried (3-5 mg/kg PO q12h;maximum,150 mg q12h).
·CAUTION: none of these medications should be used concurrently.
Topical
·Flunixin meglumine and fluocinolone in dimethyl sulfoxide(combined)
mupirocin,topical5%benzoylperoxide,and products capsaicin
·Intralesional corticosteroidsmay be used in early or very small lesions;
rarely of any use in chronic lesions
·Topical medications should be applied with gloves.
·Animals should be kept from licking the area for 10-15min.
Other
·After all other underlying diseases have been ruled out or treated,therapies
for psychogenic dermatoses may be tried.
·Psychotropic drugs-fluoxetine hydrochloride(1mg/kg POq24h）or
clomipramine hydrochloride(1-3mg/kg POq24h)
·Physical restraints-—Elizabethan collars and bandaging; short-term use
Comments
·Doxepin-do not use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors,clonidine,anti-
convulsants,oral anticoagulants,steroid hormones,antihistamines,or as-
pirin.
·Antihistamines-do not use more than one at a time.
·Monitor leveloflickingand chewingclosely
·Treat underlying disease to prevent recurrence.
·If no underlying disease is detected, suspect psychogenic causes (obsessive-
compulsive or self-mutilation disorder); prognosis is guarded.
·Animalsreceiving tricyclic antidepressantsCBC,chemistry profile,ECGev

TICKS AND TICK CONTROL
Steven A.Lewy
Definition/Overview
·Dogs and catsmaybeparasitized by hard ticksof the family Ixodidae.
·Ectoparasites that feed only on the bloodof their hosts;arthropods;closely
relatedto scorpions,spiders,and mites
·Transmittedmicrobialpathogens-protozoa,helminths,fungi,bacteria
rickettsiae,and viruses
·May cause toxicosis,hypersensitivity,paralysis,andblood-lossanemia
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Hard ticksfourlifestages:egg,larva,nymph,and adult;larvaeandnymphs
must feedtorepletion before detaching andmolting;as adult female ixodid
ticksengorge,they may increase theirweightby more than100-fold;afterde
tachment femalesmay lay thousands of eggs.
·Blood-loss anemiafromheavyinfestations
·Damage to theintegument-tickmouth parts cut through the host's skin;
bites are generally painless;local irritation and infectionmay occur
·Salivary secretion of neurotoxins-may lead to systemic signs（tickparalysis);
local actionmay causeimpairedhemostasis and immune suppression.
Pathogens-acquiredwhen ticks feed on infected reservoir hosts (often ro-
dentsandsmall feral mammals);sometimestransovarial transmissionoccurs
and infectedeggshatch andproduce infected larvae；greatest potential for
systemic disease occurswheninfections acquiredin earlylifestages are trans-

system
Transmission of pathogens and toxins-oftenrequiresperiods of attachment
from hours to days; the essentially painless bite allows adequate feeding times.
Signalment/History
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION
·Strong geographic specificities exist for some tick species; thus geographic
prevalence of associated diseases
·Ixodes scapularis—Lyme disease;midwest,northeast,and parts of the southeast
·Ixodespacificus-western coastal states
·Rhipicephalus sanguineus—found throughout the continental U.S.;but ca-
nine ehrlichiosis and babesiosis most common in the southeast
SPECIES
·Dogs and cats
·Cats are thought to be quite efficient atremoving ticks,but tick attachment
and subsequent tick-vectored diseases are routinely diagnosed.
RISK FACTORS
·Large hunting breeds (dogs)considered tobe at high risk,because they are
likely to come in contact with environments harboring questing ticks
·Domestic animals-can be in close contact with ticks owing to encroachment
of ticksinto suburban environments andexpansion of suburbanenvironment
intosurroundingforests,prairies,andcoastline areas
Clinical Features
·Arttached ticks or tickfeeding cavitiesfrom which ticks have detachedmay be
seen on the skin.
·Associated tick-borne diseases (borreliosis,ehrlichiosis,babesiosis，Rocky
Mountain Spotted Fever,and others)vary with the organ system(s)affected
·Irritation caused by ticks and subsequent self-traumamay lead to pyotrau-
matic dermatitis (*hot spots") in dogs
Diagnostics
·Ticks--examine the skin for attached ticks or tick feeding cavities
·Tick-borne diseases--evaluate epidemiologic considerationsfor each disease,
history of tick parasitism,and complete clinical examination
Therapeutics
·Outpatient afterremoval of ticks
·Removaldo as soon as possible to limit time available for neurotoxin or
pathogen transmission; grasp ticks close to the skin with fine-pointed tweez-

PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE
Avoid environments that harborticks;may be difficult except forpetskept
strictlyindoors
·Tickcontrolessential torealizethat thisdoesnot always equal control of
tick-borne diseasesoftenthegoalisthe perceived absence of ticksonthehost
animal
·Pets-ownersreport complete tickcontrol even though there maybe some
periodofattachmentandtickfeedingorliveticksmay spendsometime
crawlingontheanimal aftertheyhavebeenexposed tolethal levels of an aca-
ricide;immature ticksof some species(R.sanguineus and I.scapularis)may
beundetected because of theirminute size
Tick-borne pathogensmay be transmittedvery rapidly(viruses） or may re-
quire several hours(Rickettsia rickettsi）ordays(Borrelia burgdorferi)
InsecticidesandAcaricides
·In the U.S., the EPA licenses agents as effective against various species of
pests.
Control--inferred asproviding control of diseases carried by that species;al-
though thismaybecorrect insome or all cases,veterinarians shouldbeso
ease transmission before accepting a disease-control claim at facevalue;
challenging because ticks are widely dispersed in the environment, spenda
relatively shorttimeon theirhosts,posesgreatreproductive capacities,and
have longlifetimes

wide use;ease of application is asimportant as efficacy;direct marketing to

cell,killed bacterin(since 1990)and OspA (since 1996)
·Safety andefficacy-peer-reviewed published datafordogsnaturally exposed

·Ixodes tick paralysis-keep patient in a cool,air-conditioned area; toxin is
temperature sensitive; avoid activity to prevent increase in body temperature
·Withhold foodandwater if patient has dysphagia orvomiting/regurgitation.
DRUGS OF CHOICE
U.S.if the tick cannot be found,dip the patient in an insecticidal bath; of-
ten the only treatment needed
·Australia-must neutralize circulating toxin via hyperimmune serum(O.5-1
mg/kgIV),depending on severity of clinical signs;if severe,phenoxybenza
mine, an α-adrenergic antagonist (1 mg/kg IV diluted in saline and given
slowly over 20 min) appears to be beneficial in relieving the sympathetic ef-
fects; acepromazine (0.5-1 mg/kg IV) can be used as an alternative (it has a
adrenergic blocking effects)
CONTRAINDICATIONS
·Drugs that interfere with neuromuscular transmission are contraindicated
(e.g.,tetracyclines,aminoglycosides,and procaine penicillin).
·Ixodes tick—atropine contraindicated in the advanced stages of disease or
with marked bradycardia
PRECAUTIONS
Ixodestick-administerintravenousfluids at a very slowratetoavoidfurther com-
plications of pulmonary congestion
Comments
CLIENT EDUCATION
·Non-Ixodes tickinform client that good nursing care is essential,although
the patient's recovery is rapid after removal of ticks
·Ixodes tick-warn client that signs often continue to worsen despite tick re
moval; thus,more aggressive treatment to neutralize the toxin must be un-
dertaken.
·Non-Ixodes tick-reassess neurologic status after tick removal at least
dailyshould seerapid improvement in muscle strength in animals
·Ixodes tick-monitor neurologic status and respiratory and cardiovascular
functions continuously and intensively even after tick removal,because of the
residualeffect of neurotoxin
·Vigilantly check for ticks after exposure (at least every 2-3 days); signs do not
occur for 4-6 days after tick attachment.
·Weekly insecticidal baths or the use of insecticide-impregnated collars helps.
·Short-term acquired immunity develops after exposure to Ixodes neurotoxin.
184
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinical Companion
No long-term complications if the patient survives the acute effects of the
toxin
·Non-Ixodes tick-prognosis good to excellent if ticks areremoved;recovery
occurs in 1-3 days
Ixodes tick—prognosis often guarded;recovery prolonged;death in 1-2 days
withouttreatment
·Although humans can acquire the disease bybeingbitten by the same ticks
(especially in Australia), tick paralysis is not transmitted to humans from af-
fected pets.

Definition/Overview
·Flea allergy dermatitis-hypersensitivity reaction to antigens in flea saliva
withorwithout evidenceoffleas andfleadirt
Flea infestation-large number of fleas anda large amount of flea dirt with
orwithout a flea allergy dermatitis
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Flea bite hypersensitivity (FBH)-caused by a low molecular weight hapten
andtwohighmolecularweight allergens thathelp initiate the allergicreac-
tion
High molecular weight allergens-increase binding to dermal collagen;when
bound,formacompleteantigennecessaryforelicitingFBH
·Flea saliva-contains histamine-like compounds thatirritateskin
Intermittent exposure favorsFBH;continuous exposure islesslikely toresult
in hypersensitivity.
·BothIgEand IgGantiflea antibodies have been noted.
·Immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions havebeen noted.
Late-phaseIgE-mediated response-part ofFBHreaction;occurs 3-6hr af-
terexposure
·Cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity-part of FBHreaction;an infiltration of
basophils into the dermis;mediated either byIgEorIgG;subsequent expo-
sures cause thebasophils to degranulate;manifests asimmediate anddelayed

The 5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
Signalment/History
·Dogs and cats
·FBH-—anybreed;most common in atopic breeds
·FBH—rare < 6 months of age; average age range, 36 years, but may be seen
at any age
·FBH-intermittent exposure to fleas increases thelikelihood of development;
commonly seen in conjunction with atopy
HISTORICAL FINDINGS
·Compulsive biting
·Chewing(corncob nibbling)
·Licking, primarily in the back half of the body but may include the ante-
brachial regions
·Cats-scratching around the head and neck
·Signs of fleas and flea dirt
Clinical Features
·Depends somewhat on the severity of the reaction and the degree of exposure
to fleas (i.e., seasonal vs.year-round)
·Finding fleas andflea dirt isbeneficial,althoughnot essential,for the diag
nosis of FBH; sensitive animals require a low exposure and tend to over-
groom,making identification of the parasites difficult.
·Dogs-lesions concentrated in a triangular area of the caudal-dorsal-lum-
bosacralregion;caudalaspectof the thighs,lowerabdomen,inguinalregion,
and cranial forearms usually involved;primary lesions arepapules;secondary
lesions(e.g.,hyperpigmentation,lichenification,alopecia,and scaling)com-
mon in uncontrolled FBH;secondary folliculitis and furunculosis may be
seen.
·Cats-several patterns are seen; most common is a miliary crusting dermati-
tis in awedge-shaped pattern over thecaudal dorsal lumbosacralregion and
often around the head and neck; other presentations are alopecia of the in-
guinal regionwith orwithoutinflammation oreosinophilic plaquesand other
forms of eosinophilic granuloma complex.
·Exposure to other animals and previous flea treatment should be ascertained.
Differential Diagnosis
·Food allergy
·Atopy
· Sarcoptic mange
·Cheyletiellosis
·Primarykeratinization defects
Fleas and Flea Control
187
Diagnostics
Cats--hypereosinophiliamaybe detected
·Skin scrapings-negative
Flea combingsfleas orflea dirt,but often nothingis found
·RAST and ELISA-variable accuracy;both false-positive and false-negative
results reported
·Diagnosis usuallybased onhistorical information and distribution of lesions
·Fleas or flea dirt is supportive but is often quite difficult tofind,especially in
cats.
·Identification of Dipylidium caninum segments is supportive.
·Intradermal allergy testingwith flea antigenreveals positive immediate re-
actions in 90% of flea-allergic animals; delayed reactions (24-48 hr) may
sometimes be observed in allergic animals thatshowno immediatereaction
·The most accurate test may be response to appropriate treatment.
BIOPSY
·Superficial perivascular dermatitis
·Eosinophilicintraepidermalmicroabscesses-—strongly suggestFBH
·Eosinophils as a major cellular component of the dermis—supportive of FBH
·Histopathologic evaluation-cannot accurately differentiate FBH from
atopy,food allergy,or other hypersensitivities
Therapeutics
·Corticosteroids-anti-inflammatory dosagesforsymptomatic relief while the
fleas are being controlled
·Antihistamines—symptomatic relief
·Fipronil (GABA antagonist)—monthly spot treatment for cats and dogs and
spray treatment for dogs; activity against fleas and ticks;resistant toremoval
with water; excellent safety and efficacy profile
·Imidacloprid—monthly spot treatment for cats and dogs; excellent safety and
efficacy profile
·Systemic treatments-limitedbenefit because theyrequire a flea bite that has
already initiated FBH;may help animals with flea infestation;primarily li-
censedforuseinonlydogs;lufenuron,achitininhibitor,availableasanoral
formulation for cats and dogs and as an injection for cats; permethrin avail-
able as a spot treatment andreputed to have some repellent activity;imida
cloprid (flea adulticide) available as a spot treatment for cats and dogs.
·Spraysusually contain pyrethrins and pyrethroids (synthetic pyrethrins)
with an insect growth regulator or synergist;generally effective<48-72hr;
advantages are low toxicity and repellent activity; disadvantages are frequent
applications and expense
·Indoor treatment-fogs and premises sprays; usually contain organophos
phates,pyrethrins,and/or insect growth regulators; apply according toman
ufacturer's directions; treat all areas of the house; can be applied by the
owner; advantages are weak chemicals and generally inexpensive; disadvan

·Outdoor treatmentconcentrated in shaded areas;sprays usually contain
pyrethroids or organophosphates and an insect growth regulator;powders
are usually organophosphates; product containing nematodes(Steinerma car-
pocapsae)isvery safe and chemical-free
PRECAUTIONS
·Insecticidal sprays and dips should not be used on dogs and cats≤3months,
unless otherwise specified on the label.
Pyrethrin/pyrethroid-type flea products-adverse reactions include depression,
hypersalivation,muscletremors,vomiting,ataxia,dyspnea,andanorexia
·Organophosphatesadversereactions include hypersalivation,lacrimation,
urination,defecation,vomiting,diarrhea,miosis,fever,muscletremors,
seizures,coma,and death
·All pesticides must be applied according to label directions.
·Toxicity-ifany signs are noted,the animal shouldbebathed thoroughly to
removeanyremainingchemicalsandtreatedappropriately
·Rodents andfish areverysensitive topyrethrins
POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS
·Organophosphatetreatments-donotusemore thanoneform at a time.
·Topical organophosphatesavoid in cats,very young animals (<3months
of age),and sick or debilitated animals
·Straight permethrin sprays or spot-ons—do not use in cats
·Cythioate-contraindicated in heartworm-positive dogs and greyhounds
●Piperonylbutoxide-donot use in concentrations>1% in cats
ALTERNATIVE DRUGS
·Powders-usually contain organophosphates or carbamates; advantage is
high residualeffectiveness; disadvantages are dry skin and toxicity;
organophosphates and carbamates should be avoided in cats
·Dips,sprays,powders,and foamsdips usually contain organophosphates
andsyntheticpyrethrins and shouldnotbeusedmore than onceperweek;
followmanufacturer's instructionsfor safest and best results;afterrepeated
essentially replaced theseproducts
Comments
·Inform owners that there is no cure for FBH.
·Advise owners that flea-allergic animals often become more sensitive to flea
bites as they age.
Fleas and Flea Control
189
·Inform owners that controlling exposure to fleasis currently the only means
of therapy; hyposensitization has not worked satisfactorily.
·Pruritus-a decrease means theFBH isbeing controlled
·Fleas and flea dirt-absence is not always a reliable indicator of successful
treatment in very sensitive animals
·Year-roundwarm climates-year-round flea control
·Seasonallywarm climates-begin flea control in May or June
·Approximately 80%of atopic dogs are also allergic to fleabites.
·Organophosphates-use with utmost caution in old animals;not recom-
mended for use in very young animals (<3months)
·In areas of moderate to severe flea infestation,people can be bitten by fleas;
usually papular lesions are located on the wrists and ankles.
·Corticosteroids and organophosphates-do not use in pregnant bitches and
queens
·Carefullyfollow thelabel directionsof eachindividual product to determine
its safety.

FLEA CONTROLPRODUCTS
JohnMacDonald
ProductsThatAffectFleaDevelopment
INSECTGROWTHREGULATORS
Insectgrowth hormones(insectgrowthregulatorsIGRs|orjuvenoids)are natural
chemicals in insects that controlvarious stages of the insect'smetabolism,mor-
phogenesis,andreproduction.They are important in organ development andmat-
uration andthe developmentandgrowth of thelarvaeingeneral.Maturationand
ultimately pupation of flea larvae,however,depend on theabsence ofnatural ju-
venile hormones that areessential for the earliergrowth.
Syntheticcompoundsproduced tomimicnatural insectgrowth hormonesrepre-
sent the class ofproducts called IGRs.Advantages of IGRs include safety,residual
activity,andovicidal/larvacidaleffects.
Pyriproxifen (Nylar) isa new-generationIGR currently on the market in a vari-
ety of formulations with impressive potency (exceeding both methoprene and
fenoxycarb)and requires onlyvery small concentrations forresidual effectiveness.
It alsodemonstrates ovicidalactivity.Pyriproxifen is stable in ultraviolet light and
has longerresidual activitywithout being broken down by theinsect.Products on
the market containing pyriproxifen(Nylar)include pressurizedcanistersfoggers,
andliquidconcentrate formixture withwaterforpremise application.Several on-
the-animal products are available,including a prediluted pump spray for on-the-
animalapplication.A pet collarcontainingpyriproxifen is labeled for1year of ac-
tivity andis currently available for use in the cat.A systemic formulation of
pyriproxifenmaybemarketed in thefuture.
Methopreneis still available,but ispredominantly sold throughnon-veterinar-
ianretail outlets.Itmay be useful forinside application oruse on the animal,but
it has the disadvantage of being inactivatedbyultraviolet light under some condi-
tions.It is also broken down by the natural esterase produced by theflealarvae,

limiting its residual activity. It has been formulated as a microencapsulated prod-
uct and continues to be popular with some pet owners for application on the ani
mal.Veterinarian use of methoprene is limited with more use of pyriproxifen.
INSECT DEVELOPMENT INHIBITORS
Insect development inhibitors (IDIs)are chemicals that interfere with the develop-
mentof thefleabutdonotmimictheactivityofinsectgrowth hormoneasdoIGRs.
The common IDI that is used is lufenuron,whichis categorizedas a benzoylphenyl
urea.Its activity is the inhibition of synthesis and deposition of chitin.Because nor-
malchitin development is critical for the survival of the insect ova andlarvae,
lufenuron is very effective on the developing larvae.It has virtually no mammalian
toxicity because mammals do notproduce chitin,which makes it very safe.
Lufenuron is a lipophilic compound that is stored in body fat and gradually re
leased.It is administeredonce amonthatadose of10mg/kgfor dogs and30mg/kg
for cats,and must be taken with food to obtain adequate absorption.Lufenuron
has no adulticidal activity.The major attributes are simplicity of treatment,safety.
and effect onflea development.It is available in formulation with a heartworm pre
ventative (milbemycin)and has recentlybeen approved for parenteral administra-
tion thatprovides 6months of activityfrom a single injection.One limitation of
systemic insect development inhibitors andgrowthregulatorsis the time required
todisrupt thelife cyclein a highlyflea-infested area.Anotherlimitation of systemic
insectdevelopment inhibitors concerns the flea-allergic animal because theproduct
does notreduce an active flea infestation and requires adult fleas to feed,thereby
eliciting an allergic response.Systemic products that interfere with the development
of pre-adult stages of the flea are often a good “safety net” for the flea-allergic dog,
butmay not be satisfactory as the only method of control.
SODIUMPOLYBORATE
Sodium borate compounds are used exclusively for inside premise application and
have a significant effect on ova and larva development. Certain formulations of bo
rate have demonstrated 12months of residual activity from a single application in
a clinical situation.Regular vacuumingmay be performedwithout disrupting the
efficacyhowevercarpetshampooingmaylimit theresidualativity.Toxicity stu
ieshavebeenconductedwith asodiumpolyboratecompounddemonstratinglow-
risk characterization and minimal toxicity potential. Sodium polyborate com-
pounds are consideredvery safe and some are labeled for use in schools,food
preparation areas,and nursinghomes.Sodium polyborate treatment is still an ef-
fectivemethod of flea control for theindoors and its greatest attribute isresidual
activityand safety.
Products For Use On the Animal
PYRETHRINS,PYRETHROIDS,AND ORGANOPHOSPHATES
Conventional on-the-animal products have included topical parasiticides repre-
sentingpour-onsandsprayscontainingpyrethrins,pyrethroids,orinsomelimited
use,organophosphatesTheseproductmaybeffectiveincontrollingfleanfesta
tions but have limited residual activity and have been replaced almost completely
by the newer residual products.Pyrethrin/permethrin compounds containing con-
ventional concentrations must be applied every other day to avert an activeflea in-
festation,or weekly athigher concentrations(2%permethrin).Concentrated solu-
tions of permethrin should not be used on cats and only when indicated by label
statements.Weekly pour-on parasiticidesmay alsobe included in the treatment
regimen.Effectiveness of these products is often incomplete and may not suffi-

ciently break theflea life cycle as the exclusive treatment.Premise treatment usu-
ally needs to be incorporated in the program to attain adequate control. Some
products contain pyriproxifen (an IGR)with the pyrethrin or permethrin,which
adds auseful dimension toprevent development of future generations of fleas.The
use of a water protectant (Forapearl) has been helpful to extend efficacy,particu-
larly if water exposure isprominent.These productsmaybe helpful as adjunctive
therapy but have limitations compared with other on-the-animal products with
residualactivity.
Organophosphates such aschlorpyrifos orphosmet for use on the animal have
nearlybeen eliminatedfromroutineusebyveterinarians,although some are avail-
ablein other retailoutlets(pet stores and feed stores).Some pet owners continue to
incorporate them inflea controlprograms,although organophosphates havelim
itedusefulnessbecauseof the availabilityofotherproducts.
IMIDACLOPRID(ADVANTAGE)
Imidacloprid(Advantage) is a chlorinated heterocycle insecticide formerly intro-
duced for crop pest controland structural pest control(termiticide)and now ap-
proved for on-the-animal adulticidalflea treatment.The active compound is a
member ofthe class called chloronicotinyl.It is a novelproduct-with no other
similar chemical currently existing-and has only recently been developed for on-
the-animal application to control fleas.Imidacloprid bindsto the acetylcholine re-
ceptor site on the postsynaptic portion of insect nerve cells and prevents transmis-
sion of impulses along the insect's nerve,resulting in death.Imidacloprid acts on
thenicotinicreceptor sitesspecifically,andecausemuscarinicreceptors arere
sent in mammals,thismode ofaction is specificforinsects.Itis prepared as a9.1%
solution andis applied as a spot treatment for dogs andcats,with recommenda-
tions of a 28-dayreapplicationrate.Preliminary data demonstrate both acute and
residual adulticidal activitywith98-100%fleakill within 24hours.Studieshave
demonstrated98%flea control for at least 14 days and96% control for 21 days.
Imidacloprid hasshown activity againstlarvae and hasbeen studiedinsimulated
situations that have showndecreaseddevelopment of fleapopulations in the envi-
ronment when the dog in that habitat had been treated with the product.An um-
brella effect hasalsobeendemonstratedwithyoung nursing animalswhose flea in-
festation regressed when the parent female was treated.Imidacloprid may be used
in animals asyoungas6-7weeksand applied at afrequency ofas oftenasweekly,
if necessary.Variation in effectiveness may vary depending on pets habits,water
exposure,bathing intervals,and the flea infestation. Concern for efficacy break-

have notbeen observed in dogs infected with heartworms.Attributes of imidaclo-
pridinclude acutelea-killingactivity,safety，andresidualactivity.
FIPRONIL(FRONTLINE SPRAY/TOPSPOT)
Fipronil (FrontlineSpray/ TopSpot)isaphenylpyrazolethathasbeenavailablefor
a short time in the U.S.,although it has been inEurope for some time.It interferes
with thepassage of the chloride ion through the gamma-aminobutyricacid(GABA)

tivity.The extent of efficacy for adulticidal flea control is expected tobe 28 days or
longerfromasingle applicationbutmayvary depending ongeographical location,
exposure towater,interval of bathing,and extent of flea infestation.
Fipronil is also acaricidaland is recommended in situations inwhich there is tick
infestation.Regional efficacy may be variable with regards to tickcontrol.Limited
anecdotal information has demonstrated some scabicidal effectiveness in clinical
cases.The manufacturer has demonstrated95%controlof flea infestation4weeks
after application.The advantage of fipronil is the long-term on-the-animal adulti-
cidalactivitymakingitparticularlyadvantageousforflea-allergic dogsincontrast
tosystemics,whichrequireflea feeding.Because theproduct is absorbedin the skin
andre-released,limited bathing orexposure towatermaynot significantlyalterthe
activity.Studies sponsored by the manufacturer demonstrate no significant de-
crease in the 4-week residual effect of fipronil with limited concurrent bathing.
The disadvantage of the fipronil spray formulation is the alcohol base,which
may have a drying or irritancy effectparticularly if the skin isinflamed,excori
ated,or eroded.Another limitation is the quantity necessary for effective flea con-
trol.Precise dosingis essential formaximal efficacy,whichmay require substantial
spray solutionforthelargerdog,thusincreasing expense and labor.Thicklycoated
animals may have less effective flea control because of inadequate penetration to
the skin with the spray. Cats have a shorter duration of activity lasting only 2-3
weeks.

·Ivermectin-not FDA-approved for this use in dogs,cats,or rabbits; client
disclosure and consent are paramount before administration; several dog
breedse.g,collies,shelties,Australian shepherds）have shown increased sen
sitivity andshouldnotbetreated
·Treatment failure necessitates re-evaluation for other causes of pruritus and
scaling.
·Reinfestationmay indicate contact with an asymptomatic carrier or the pres-
ence of an unidentified source of mites (e.g.,untreated bedding).
·Zoonotic potential:A pruritic papular rash may develop in areas of contact
with the pet.

It can take as long as 4-6weeks for the intense pruritus and clinical signs to
resolve, owing to the hypersensitivity reaction.
·Topical treatments are prone to failure, owing to incomplete application of
the treatment solution.
·Reinfection can occur if the contact with infected animals continues.
·Always consider sarcoptic mange as a possible cause of pruritus in allergic
dogs that cease to respond to steroid therapy.
Approximately30%of dogs withSarcoptes infections willalso react to house
dust mite antigens.

·May be mixed with mineral oil(3 mL amitraz to 30mL mineral oil) for ap-
plication to focalareas,such as pododemodicosis
·Success with the 9%amitraz collar has notbeen established,although there
are positive anecdotal reports.

POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS
Amitrazmay interact with heterocyclic antidepressants,xylazine,benzodi
azepines,and macrocyclic lactones
·Ivermectin and milbemycin-cause elevated levels of monoamine neuro-
transmitter metabolites,which could result in adverse drug interactions with
amitraz and benzodiazepines
·Multiple skin scrapings and evidence of clinical resolution are used to moni-
tor progress.
·Avoid breeding animals with generalized form.
EXPECTED COURSE AND PROGNOSIS
·Prognosis (dogs)—-depends heavily on genetic, immunologic, and underlying
diseases
·Localized—most cases (90%) resolve spontaneously with no treatment;
<10% progress to the generalized form
·Adult-onset(dogs)—often severe andrefractory to treatment
·Adult-onset-—sudden occurrence is often associated with internal disease,
malignant neoplasia,and/or immunosuppressive disease;approximately
25%of cases are idiopathic over a follow-up period of 1-2years

EAR MITES
KarenA.KuhlandJeanS.Greek
Definition/Overview
Otodectes cynotismites cause a hypersensitivityreaction thatresultsin intense ir-
ritation of the external ear of dogs and cats(Fig.27-1).
Signalment/History
Common in young dogsand cats,although it may occur at any age
No breed or sex predilection
Clinical Features
Pruritusprimailylocated around theearsead,andneck;ccasionallygn-
eralized
·Thick,red-brown or black crusts-usually seen in the outer ear
Crusting and scales may occur on theneck,rump,and tail.
Excoriations on the convex surface of the pinnae often occur,owing to the
intense pruritus.

approved for this use
·Pyrethrin-based flea spray-treat entire animal weekly for 46weeks if not
using systemic ivermectin
Environment--treat witha flea-type preparation two times,2-4 weeks apart
Comments
Ivermectindo notuse in collies,shelties,their crosses,or ther herding
breeds; use only if absolutely necessary in animals <6 months of age; an in-
creasing number of toxic reactionshave beenreported in kittens
·Amitraz-reported to cause adversereactions in cats when used topically for
generalized infestations;thus,use with caution
·An ear swab and physical examination should be done1 month after therapy
commences.
●For most patients, prognosis is good.
·Rarely,the infestation will be cleared only to find an underlying allergy that
keeps the otitis externa active.
·The mites will also bite humans (rare).

CARBAMATE
Steven R.Hansen and ElizabethA.Curry-Galvin
Definition/Overview
·Resultsfrom exposure to organophosphorous compoundsor carbamate,
which are common activeingredients inhousehold and agricultural insecti-
cideproducts
Animal products-organophosphate:chlorpyrifos,coumaphos,cythioate,di-
azinon,famphur,fenthion,phosmet,and tetrachlorvinphos;carbamate:car-
baryl and propoxur
Agricultural,lawn,andgarden products-organophosphate:acephate,chlor-
pyrifosdazinnisftnalanaratin,buoandra
bamate:carbofuran andmethomyl
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Causenervous system effects byinhibiting cholinesterase,which includes
acetylcholinesterase,pseudocholinesterase,andotheresterases
·Acetylcholinesterase-normallyhydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetyl-
cholineinnervous tissue,RBCs,and muscle,resultingin termination ofner-
voustransmission
Pseudocholinesterasefound in plasma,liver,pancreas,and nervous tissue,
mainlyin cats
·Cholinesterase inhibition-allows acetylcholine accumulation at the postsy-
napticreceptor;causes stimulation of effector organs;spontaneousreactiva-
tionafterorganophosphorouscompoundbindingisvery slowand,onceag
ing occurs,isvirtuallynonexistent；reversible after carbamatebinding
220
Organophosphate and CarbamateToxicity
221
·Nervous systemeffects result from overriding stimulation of parasympa-
theticpathways;may also result from sympathetic stimulation;acetylcholine
stimulates nicotinic receptors of the somatic nervous system (skeletal muscle),
parasympathetic preganglionic nicotinic and postganglionic muscarinic re-
ceptors（cardiacmuscle,pupilbloodvessels,smoothmusclesinlungandgas
trointestinal tract,exocrineglands),andsympatheticpreganglionicnicotinic
receptors(adrenalandindirectlycardiacmuscle,pupilbloodvessels,smooth
muscles in lung and gastrointestinal tract, exocrine glands).
·Animals with inherently low cholinesterase activity—more susceptible to
cholinesterase depression
·Cholinesterase activity-more easily inhibited in cats than in dogs
Signalment/History
·Cats and small or exceptionally lean dogs-most susceptible
·Lean dogs (e.g., sight hounds and racing breeds) and lean longhair cats--
more susceptible to cholinesterase inhibition because of lack offat;many
organophosphorous compounds and metabolites are stored in fat and slowly
released into circulation
·Organophosphate-containing dips labeled for dogs only-inappropriately
applied to cats
·Young animals-more likely intoxicated owing to lower detoxification capa-
bility
·Intact males more susceptible to some organophosphates
·Concurrent exposure to multiple organophosphate- and/or carbamate-con-
tainingproducts
·Exposure tofloors that are dampwith organophosphorouspremiseproducts
·Incorrect dilution of insecticides
Clinical Features
·Parasympathetic stimulation-usually predominates
·Sympathetic stimulation-may result in lack of specific expected signs;may
note opposite signs from those expected
·Medical history--often discloses heavy or repeated applications of flea and
tick insecticides; evidence of exposure to an agricultural product
·Carbamate insecticides(methomyl and carbofuran)—may cause rapid onset
of seizures and respiratory failure; treat aggressively without delay
·Organophosphate insecticides (cats)-chronic anorexia,muscle weakness,

·Other toxicants-chocolate;caffeine;cocaine; amphetamine
Diagnostics
CHOLINESTERASEACTIVITY
·Reduced to <25% of normal in whole blood,retina, or brain—suggests ex-
posure to a cholinesterase-inhibiting compound
·Test results-must be interpreted in context of the amount of exposure and
the clinical signs and the time of their onset
·Use laboratories experienced in handling animal samples.
·Chlorpyrifosexperimentally exposed animalsmay remain clinically normal
with no detectable cholinesterase activity
·Carbamate inhibition--reactivation may occur during sample transport and
testing,giving false-negative results
·Detection of insecticides-tissue (e.g., brain, liver, kidney, and fat); stomach
contents; gastrointestinal tract; fur or hair; negative results do not rule out
toxicosis
·May find pieces of chewed containers in the gastrointestinal tract
Therapeutics
·Outpatient—mild signs from exposure to flea and tick collars and powders;
treated by simply removing the collar or brushing excess powder from the
coat
·Inpatientcontinued salivation, tremors,or dyspnea

PRURITUS
W. Dunbar Gram
Definition/Overview
The sensation thatprovokes the desire to scratch,rub,chew,orlick;an indicator
ofinflamed skin
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Aspecific end organ hasnotbeen found.
·The sensation of itchis conducted byAfibersand Cfibers of the peripheral
nervoussystem to thedorsalroot of the spinal cord.
The axons,some ofwhich cross over,ascendvia the lateral spinothalamic
tract andsynapsein the caudal thalamus and then to the sensory cortex.
Other factors canmodify theperception of pruritus at thislevel.
Signalment/History

Clinical Features
·The act of scratching,licking,biting,or chewing
·For some animals, evidence of self-trauma and cutaneous inflammation is
necessary to make the diagnosis if the history is incomplete.
·Cats-can be secretive lickers; alopecia without inflammation may be the
only sign
·Alopeciain most cases, a clear history of pruritus is noted;without pruri-
tus,may accompany endocrine diseases; some animals may excessively lick
themselves without the owners’knowledge; demodicosis,dermatophytosis,
bacterial pyoderma,seborrhea,some cutaneous neoplasms,and unusual dis
eases (e.g.,leishmaniasis）may cause alopecia with varying degrees of inflam-
mation andpruritus
Differential Diagnosis
·Parasitic—fleas,scabies,Demodex,Otodectes,Notoedres,Cheyletiella
trombicula,lice,Pelodera,endoparasitemigration
·Allergicarasite,atopy,ood,contact,rug,bacterial hyprsensitivity
·Bacterial/fungal
·Miscellaneous-primary and secondary seborrhea,calcinosis cutis,cuta
neous neoplasia,immune-mediated dermatosis; psychogenic diseases and en-
docrine dermatosisvariable
·Uncomplicated atopy-initially very steroid responsive; originally seasonal;
often progresses to nonseasonal,pruritic disease with apredilection for the
face,feet,ars,forelimbs,axilla,andrump;leaand ood-allergicanimals
are predisposed to atopy and may show similar signs
Diagnostics
·Skin scrapes,epidermal cytology,and dermatophyte cultures (with micro-
scopicidentification)-identify primary or co-existing diseases causedbypar-
asites or othermicroorganisms
·Wood's lamp-do not use as the sole means of diagnosing or excluding der-
matophytosis,owing to false negatives andmisinterpretations of fluorescence.
ALLERGY TESTING
·Twomethods-skin testing(intradermal skin testing)and blood testing:skin
testing is the historical standard and the preferred method; some veterinary
dermatologists use both tests
·Skin testingidentify individual allergens;takes into account the important
allergy-associated immunoglobulins (IgGd and systemic as well as localized
IgE)
·Blood testingcommercial tests for allergies measure only serum IgE, not
IgGd;disadvantage,some tests determine groups or mixes of allergens
·Allergy extract-correlate positive reactions with the history; then formulate
the immunotherapy solution; contains a mixture of specific allergens,based

SKIN BIOPSY
·Useful when associated lesions are unusual and an immune-mediated disease
is expected or thehistory and physical findings do not correlate
·Results should be interpreted by a trained veterinary dermatopathologist.
TRIAL COURSES
Canine Scabies
·Can be difficult to diagnose
·Skin scrapes often negative
·Trial course （lime sulfur, ivermectin)often necessary to rule out
·Ivermectin-use caution;associated with idiosyncratic reactions and death
Food Allergy
·Blood and skin tests-notrecommendedfor diagnosis
·Hypoallergenic dietary trial most appropriate test
·Trialmust include only novel food; use a diet that has been confirmed as
hypoallergenic through clinical trials; avoid meat-flavored treats and
medicines(heartworm preventatives); continue trialuntil patient improves or
for8-10weeks;ifimprovement isnoted,reintroduce originaldiet andmon-
itor for itching for 7-14 days;return of itching may occur within hours; rein-
troductionof originaldietconfirmsfoodallergy
Therapeutics
·More than one disease may be contributing to the itching;if treatment for an
identified condition does not result in improvement,consider other causes.
Use of a mechanical restraint (e.g.,Elizabethan collar) can help but is seldom
feasible in thelong term.
TOPICAL THERAPY
·Helpful for mild cases
·Localizedsprays,lotions,and creams
·Generalized—shampoos
·Colloidal oatmealavailable in all forms;may be very beneficial;duration of
effect usually<2 days
·Antihistamines-beneficial effect not demonstrated
·Anesthetics-very short duration of effect
·Antibacterial shampoo-controls bacterial infections; some (e.g.,benzoyl
peroxide oriodine)may exacerbate the condition due to irritant effect
·Lime sulfurmay be antipruritic; has antiparasitic, antibacterial, and anti-
fungal properties; disadvantages are bad odor and staining
·Steroidsmost useful topical medication; excessive use causes localized and
systemic side effects;hydrocortisone mildest and most common; stronger
234
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinical Companion
drugs （e.g,betamethasone)more effective,more expensive,and causemore
side effects; some contain ingredients (e.g., alcohol) that increase irritation
·Sometimes the application of any substance,including water (especially
warm water),can worsen itching sensation; cool water is often soothing.
SYSTEMICTHERAPY
·Three pathways lead toinflammation and itching.
·Steroids-block all three pathways; undesirable side effects; consider drugs
that blockindividual pathways
·Antihistamineshydroxyzine,diphenhydramine,and chlorpheniramine;
block only one pathway
·w-3andw-6fatty acids-available aspowder,liquid,andcapsules;help
block individualpathways thatlead to inflammation;6-8weeks untilmaxi-
mum effect is observed; prevent rather than stop inflammation;help control
dry or flaky skin
·Psychogenics-can help control itching; amitriptyline (Elavil;a human an-
tidepressant)has rather potent antihistaminic actions in dogs,with side ef-
fects similar to antihistamines; doxepin is similar;fluoxetine (Prozac)used
with variable success in treating canine lickgranuloma(acral lick dermatitis);
diazepam(Valium)hasbeen beneficial;reports of acute hepatotoxicity in cats
·The use of nonsteroid drugs is less convenient but diminishes the potential for
serious sideeffects;ifnotttally effectiveincontrollingclinicalsignstheyf
ten help reduce the amount of steroidsnecessary to decrease itching.
STEROIDS
·Mostwell-known drugused to control itching
·Significant long-term and not always obvious side effects
·Used wisely,usually safe
·Avoid long-term daily administration of oral corticosteroids(includingpred-
nisone ormethylprednisolone).
·Avoid long-term dailyoralternate-day administration of triamcinolone (Ve-
talog).
·Short-termuse seldom causesseriousproblems.
·Avoid with a history of pancreatitis,diabetes mellitus,calcinosis cutis,de-
modicosis,dermatophytosis,and other infectious diseases.
Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g, azathioprine)—-use in extremely rare cases;
because ofpotentialprofound side effects,reserve for cases in which eu-
thanasia isbeing considered or when all other treatments have failed.
Comments
·Sometimes the application of anything topically,including water andprod
ucts containingalcohol,iodine,and benzoylperoxidecanexacerbate itching;
cool water may be soothing.
·Steroids--avoid with infectious causes
·Multiple causes（e.g.,flea allergy,inhalant allergy,and pyoderma)common;
eradication or control of one cause may not be enough to reduce the condi-
tion.

PRURITICINFLAMMATORY
SKIN DISEASE
KarenHeltonRhodes
The pruritic patient is a common problem inveterinary medicine.Many of the dis-
easesthatpromotepruritus arenotcurable andmust thereforebecontrolled over
a long duration of time.An underlying etiology must first be determined before
considering long-term antipruritic therapy.Corticosteroidsare the mostfrequently
used drugs inveterinarymedicine,yet shouldnotbe used asa maintenance form of
therapy until anetiology hasbeen determined and othermedications have been
tested.
Canineand feline allergicdermatitisisthehallmarkof pruriticinflammatory dis-
eases in veterinary medicine andwill be used as the model for the following dis-
cussion.The discussed medications are not meant to replace appropriate “diag-
nostic”procedures (ie.,food elimination diet trials,intradermal skin testing,ete.)
butrather toaugment thetherapeuticmanagement protocol chosen forthe indi-
vidual patient.
Much of the confusionin themanagement of the pruriticpatient stems from the
fact that the exactmediator(s）andpathophysiologyof pruritusareunknown.Lim-
itedinformationis availablein theveterinary literature of pruritus in the dog and
cat.Most investigatorsmake the assumption thatbecause antihistaminesare not
capableofrelievingpruritusinalargepercentageofanimalsproteolyticenzymes
must be the primary mediator rather than histamine.Because most proteases are
potent histamine releasers,this explanation cannot be entirely correct.Recent at-
tention has focused on the eicosanoids.Becauseof thisconfusion,theselection of
an appropriatemedicationis therefore difficult andoften depends on therapeutic
trials.This“trial and error”method of drug selection isbothcostly and frustrating
for the client.

Proposed Pathophysiology of Pruritus
Various stimuli that causeitchingmay elicit two distinctresponses:spontaneous
itch anitch that is localized to the siteof the stimulus and persists onlybriefly af-
ter the stimulus isremoved) andpathologicitch(an itchthat ismore poorly local-
ized or diffuse).Both itch and pain sensations are theresult of the activation of a
network of free nerve endings at the dermoepidermal junction.However,these
nerve endings alone donot determine itch sensitivity;certain regions of the skin
thathavea lowthreshold for pruritusdonot havehighernumbersof nerve endings
comparedwith less sensitive areas.Itch isconsidereda primary sensory modality
rather than subthreshold pain,as was previously believed.The phenomenon of
itchy skin isfamiliar to all physicians andveterinarians.Whether thisform of pru-
ritusrelies on specificreceptors (unmyelinated slow-conducting Cfibers rather
thanrapid-conductingAfibers)oractivation ofa facilitating circuit ofadjacent
neuronsfollowingstimulation isunknown.
Influences of the CNS on pruritus have been described as a“gate-control” sys-
tem.Simultaneous firing oflarge-diameter myelinated fibers presynaptically in-
hibitsfiringof the smaller afferentfibers sothat the sensation that theyusually
evokeisdiminishedinintensity orevennotperceived.Psychologicalfactorsareca
pable of influencing the“gate-control” system.The discovery that opioid pen-
tapeptides (enkephalins) could act as neurotransmitters has led to speculation re-
fibers.These mediators relieve pain and may subsequently cause pruritus by acti-
vatingenkephalinergicinhibitoryinterneurons,modifyingthesensation ofpain.In
addition to theinfluence on the CNS,theseopioidsmayinfluence the peripheral
nervous system aswell by potentiating histamine-induced itch.Enkephalin-like im-
munoreactivity has been identified in the Merkel cell.Systemic administration of
the opiate antagonist naloxonehydrochloride(Narcan)elevates thesensory thresh-
oldforitchand causesinitial,although unsustained,decrease inpruritus.
Perphraldiarfurituutintai
donic acid products,and serotonin.Histaminein lowconcentrationsinducesitch,
whereas larger amounts elicit pain.A superficial injection of histamine causes itch
whereas a deep injection causes pain.Histaminereceptors are classified asH1 and
H2.Via decreased cAMP,H1,butnot H2,receptors are involved in histamine-
evoked itching.H2receptors(via increasedcAMP)play a regulatory roleby acting
as anegativefeedbacksystemin some species.Thishistamine-induced pruritusmay
be initiatedviaH1receptors,andalsovia theactivationofothermediatorssuchas
substancePorprostaglandins.
Proteases,another class of peripheral mediators,include endogenous (trypsin,
chymotrypsin,fibinolysinkallikrein）andexogenous（icin,apainstrptokinas）
mediators.Thepruritogenic effect of theseenzymesisunrelatedto their proteolytic
activity.Proteases are potent histamine releasers and most likely initiate pruritus
via thismechanism.Kallikrein is the onlyknown protease to cause pruritus inde
pendent of histamine release.Peptides,such as bradykinin,vasoactive intestinal
peptide,neurotensin,secretin,and substancePare potent histaminereleasers.
Inflammationof theskinmaybeassociatedwiththetransformationofthecell
membrane component arachidonic acid in a numberof cell types,including ker-
atinocytes,into a variety ofpro-inflammatory fatty acids.These include the
prostaglandins,polymorphonuclear chemoattractant monohydroxy fatty acids,
and leukotrienes.Prostaglandins,primarilyPgEl,amplify pharmacologically in
duced itchingbyloweringthethresholdof thefreenerve endingreceptorstotheef
fects ofhistamine and proteolytic enzymes.Pro-inflammatory mediators also in
clude 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,and
leukotrienes C4,D4,andE4.Serotonin injectedintradermally cancausepruritus.

The influence of skin temperature on itch remains unclear.Empirical observa-
naleforbathing in lukewarm or coolwarm water).Itching may alsobe influenced
by diurnal rhythms of the body,whichhave been attributed to both diurnal skin
temperature fluctuations as well as epinephrine fluctuations.UVA and UVB may
influence pruritus by inactivatingpruritogens.UVB has alsobeen reported to alter
vitamin Dmetabolism,causing an alterationinions and therebyless itching.
The immunologic aspects of pruritus are also less than conclusive.Immunologic
defects associated with allergic dermatitis in the animal are under investigation.An-
tipruriticmedicationsmaybedirected ata specific alterationintheimmune system
ofthepatient.Suspected alterations include endothelial cells that abnormallyex
press adhesion molecules,increase in T-helper cells,hyperstimulatory epidermal
Langerhans cells, B-cell overproduction of IgE,increased dermal levels of
eosinophil-derivedMBP,serumIgAalterations,local stimulation ofLangerhans
cellsintheepidermisncreasedphosphodiesteraseactivity,loweredplasma triglyc
eride levels,and so forth.
This limited knowledge forms the basis behind many of our therapeutic choices
to control pruritus in animals.The exactpathomechanism of pruritus and even the
specific etiology and pathogenesis of allergic dermatitis are still a mystery.
Proposed Pathophysiology of "Atopic"Skin Disease
1.Percutaneous absorbed allergen (allergen penetration enhanced by epidermal
barrier defect)
2.Allergen encounters allergen-specific IgE on Langerhans cells
3.Allergen is trapped by Langerhans cells,processed, and presented to allergen-
specific T cells
4.Expansion of allergen-specificTh2cells,which produceIL3,IL4,IL5,IL6,
andIL10
5. An increase in Th2 cells causes an increase in allergen-specific IgE production
via IL4 (will also see a proportional decrease in Th1 cells,which are
responsible for inhibiting allergen-specific IgEproduction viaalpha-interferon)
6.Therefore,enhanced production of allergen specific IgEby B cells
Drugs Used in Controlling Pruritus
Glucocorticoids
Glucocorticoids arewithoutquestionthemost effective drugs incontrollingpruritus.
Anti-inflammatory effects of steroids include the following:
1.Decreasedmigration of neutrophils into the tissue
2.Inhibited release of inflammatory cytokines from macrophages (IL1,TNF
alpha,prostaglandins)
3.Inhibited phagocytosis by macrophages
4.Inhibitedmigration ofeosinophilsinto tissue
5. Decreased numbers of lymphocytes in circulation
6.Depressed lymphocyte activation
7. Decreased expression of cytokines from lymphocytes
8.T cells more affected than Bcells
9.Improved vascular integrity by antagonism of vasoactive amines
10.Decreased synthesis of inflammatory mediators

EssentialFattyAcidMetabolites
Essential fatty acid metabolites affect the biosynthesis ofarachidonic acid (AA) and
can bypass some pathways.Essential fatty acids for the dog are linoleic and
linolenic.Forthe cat,theyincludelinoleic,linolenic,and arachidonicacidsources
of fatty acids:GLA (gamma-linolenic acid),an omega-6 fatty acid contained in
evening primrose oil);EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid),an omega-3 fatty acid con-
tained inmarine fish oil;and ALA(alpha-linolenic acid),an omega-3fattyacid con-
tained invegetable oil (soy,canolalinseed）.Most essential fatty acid supplements
use a combination of EPA and GLA.In theory,increased quantities of EPA and
GLA may help decrease pruritus and inflammation by altering the potency and
quantity of eicosanoids (PG and LT).EPA can displace AA in cell membrane and
when the cells are activated during inflammation,moreEPA ismetabolized by cy-
clo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase than is AA.EPA breakdown products are less in-
flammatory than is AA products.
EPA - prostaglandins of the 3 series and leukotrienes of the 5 series (less in-
flammatory)
AA -prostaglandin 2,12-HETE,leukotriene 4（very inflammatory)
GLA ismetabolized to DGLA(dihomo-gamma linolenic acid)which is further
metabolized toPGE1 (anti-inflammatory).ALA can be metabolized toEPA.
Clinical trials with EFA supplementation are varied and best used in combina-
tion with other medications.Antihistamines may produce a synergistic effect with
EFAs.
Side effects:
1.Transient decreased platelet aggregation after 3 months of use (no clinical
effects)
2.Increased risk of pancreatitis
3.Fish odor on breath
Antihistamines
Antihistamines are grouped into two classes: H1 receptor antagonists and H2 re-
ceptor antagonists.(Table 33-2)
Side effects:
1.Sedation
2.Dry mouth
3.Blurred vision
4.Urinary retention
5.Appetite stimulation
Adverse effects:
1.Seizures and coma from overdose (first generation)
2.Cardiotoxic at high concentrations;ketoconazole may potentiate these effects
(second generation)(synergistic effect with corticosteroids and thus allow
lowering of the steroid dose needed[30%reduction])
PsychotropicDrugs
Psychotropic drugs are primarily used for obsessive/compulsive disorders (OCD).
Many pruritic cases may have a component of OCD.Some of these drugs can also
bind to histamine as well as serotonin receptors and are thus powerful antihis-
tamines as well (i.e., amitryptilline).These medications have varied effectiveness
and should not be the “first line of defense.”Avoid use with monoamine oxidase
inhibitors.(Table 33-3)

H2 receptors are normally used for their antisecretory effects,yet there is some evidence they
may be helpful for dermatologic disease.Tagamet and Atarax can be used in combination to
treat pruritus.Cometidine orranitidine may enhance relief from pruritus andwheal formation
in refractory cases of urticaria.The H2receptor antagonists caninhibitmetabolism of H1

HYPERSENSITIVITY
REACTION
ANAPHYLAXIS)
Paul W. Snyder
Definition/Overview
Acute manifestation of a typeIhypersensitivityreactionmediated through
the rapidintroduction of an antigen into a host having antigen-specific anti-
bodies of the IgEsubclass
·Thebindingof antigen to mast cells sensitizedwith IgEresultsin the release
ofpreformed andnewly synthesizedchemical mediators.
Anaphylacticreactionsmay be localized (atopy) or systemic(anaphylactic
shock).
·Anaphylaxis notmediatedbyIgEisdesignated an anaphylactoidreaction and
will not be discussed.
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·First exposure of the patient to a particular antigen (allergen) causes a hu-
moralresponse andresultsin production ofIgE,which binds to the surface
ofmast cells;the patient is then considered to be sensitized to that antigen.
Second exposure to the antigen results in cross-linking of two or more IgE
moleculeson thecell surface,resultingin mastcelldegranulation and activa-
tion;release of mast cell granules initiates an anaphylacticreaction.
·Major mast cell-derived mediators include histamine,eosinophilic chemo-
tactic factor,arachidonic acid,metabolites (e.g.,prostaglandins,
leukotrienes,and thromboxanes),platelet-activating factor,and proteases,
which cause an inflammatoryresponse of increased vascular permeability,
smoothmusclecontraction,inflammatory celinflux,and tissue damage.
244
Hypersensitivity Reaction(Anaphylaxis)
245
Clinical manifestations depend on theroute of antigen exposure,the dose of
antigen, and the level of the IgE response.
·Familial basis reported for type I hypersensitivity reaction in dogs
Signalment/History
·Dogs-numerous breeds documented as having a predilection for developing
atopy
·Cats--no breeds documented as having predilection for atopy
·Dogs—age of clinical onset ranges from 3 months to several years of age;
most affected animals 1-3 years old
·Cats—age of clinical onset ranges from 6months to 2years
·Dogs--atopy more common in females
·Cats-no reported sex predilection
·Previous exposure (sensitization)increases the chance of the animal develop-
ing a reaction.
Clinical Features
·Initial clinical signs vary depending on the route of exposure to the inciting
antigen (allergen).
·Shock-end result of a severe anaphylacticreaction
·Shock organdogs,liver;cats,respiratory and gastrointestinal systems
·May be localized to the site of exposure,but may progress to a systemic re-
action
Onset of signs immediate (within minutes)
·Dogs-pruritus, urticaria, vomiting, defecation, and urination
Catsintenseruritusabout thehead,dyspnea,salivation,andvomiting
·Localized cutaneous edema at the site of exposure
·Hepatomegaly in some dogs
·Hyperexcitability possible in early stages
·Depression and collapse terminally
Differential Diagnosis
·Other types of shock
·Trauma
Depends on the major organ system involvedorif reaction is localized; diag
nosis can bemade largely on thebasis of history and clinical signs
Virtually any agent;those commonly reported include venoms,blood-based
products,vaccines, foods,and drugs
·Intradermal skin testing to identify allergens
Radioallergosorbent test to quantify the concentration of serum IgE specific
for a particular antigen
Lesions vary,depending on severity of reaction,from localized cutaneous
edema to severe pulmonary edema(in cats)andvisceral pooling of blood (in
dogs)
246
The 5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
·Other nonspecific findings vary and are characteristic of shock.
·Nonspecific characteristics of localized reactions include edema,vasculitis,
and thromboembolism
Therapeutics
·In an acutely affected animal,the reaction is considered a medical emergency
requiring hospitalization.
·Elimination of inciting antigen,if possible
SYSTEMICANAPHYLAXIS
·Goal—emergency life support through the maintenance of an open airway,
preventing circulatory collapse,and re-establishing physiologic parameters
·Administer fluids intravenously at shock dosages to counteract hypotension.
LOCALIZED ANAPHYLAXIS
· Goal—limit the reaction and prevent progression to a systemic reaction.
·If a food-based allergen is suspected (uncommon), avoid foods associated
with hypersensitivity reaction.
SYSTEMICANAPHYLAXIS
·Epinephrinehydrochlorideparenterally(1:1000;0.01mL/kg)for shock
·Corticosteroids for shock-prednisolone sodium succinate (10-30mg/kg IV
q8h)or dexamethasone sodium phosphate(6-15mg/kg IVq12h)
·Atropine sulfate(0.04mg/kg IM)to counteract bradycardia and hypotension
·Aminophylline(10 mg/kg IM or slowly IV)in severely dyspneic patients
LOCALIZED ANAPHYLAXIS
·Diphenhydraminehydrochloride(1-2mg/kgIVorIM)
·Prednisolone (2 mg/kg PO)
Epinephrinehydrochloride(O.15mL SCat site of initiation)
If shock develops,initiate treatment fora systemic anaphylaxis
Comments
·Discuss the unpredictable nature of the disease.
·Discuss the need to recognize that the animal has an allergic condition that
may require immediate medical care.
·Closelymonitor hospitalized patients for 24-48 hr.
·If inciting antigen (allergen) can be identified,eliminate or reduce exposure.
·If localized reaction is treated early, prognosis is good.
●If the animal is in shock on examination, prognosis is guarded to poor.

Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Susceptible animalsbecome sensitized toenvironmentalallergensbyproduc
ing allergen-specific IgE,which binds to receptor sites on cutaneousmast
cells;further allergen exposure(inhalation,percutaneous absorption) causes
mastcell degranulation,whichisa typeIimmediate hypersensitivityreaction,

·Felineunknown; generally believed to be much lower than that for dogs
·Canine-any breed,including mongrels;because of genetic predisposition,it
may be recognizedmore frequently in certain breeds or families,which can
vary geographically
·In theUnited States（canine)Boston terriers,Cairn terriers,Dalmatians,En-
glish bulldogs, English setters, Irish setters, Lhasa apsos, miniature
schnauzers,pugs,Sealyham terriers,Scottish terriers,West Highlandwhite

·Canine—mean age at onset 1-3 years;range 3months-6 years； signsmay be
so mild the first year that they are not noted but are usually progressive and
clinically apparent before 3years of age
·Both sexes are probably affected equally.
HISTORICAL FINDINGS
·Facial,pedal,or axillary pruritus
·Early onset
·Familyhistory of atopy
·May be seasonal
·Recurring skin or ear infections
·Temporary response to glucocorticoids
·Symptoms progressivelyworsenwith time.
Clinical Features
·Hallmark sign—pruritus (itching, scratching,rubbing,licking)
·Primary lesions may occur, but most cutaneous changes are believed to be
produced by self-induced trauma.
·Areasmost commonly affected—interdigital spaces,carpal and tarsal areas,
muzzle,periocularregion,axillae,groin,and pinnae
·Lesions-varyfrom none to broken hairs or salivary discoloration to ery
thema,papularreactions,crusts,alopecia,hyperpigmentation,lichenifica
tion,excessively oilyordryseborrhea,andhyperhidrosis(apocrinesweating)
·Secondarybacterial andyeast skininfections(common)
·Chronic relapsing otitis externa
·Conjunctivitis may occur.
Differential Diagnosis
·Food hypersensitivitymay cause identical lesion distribution and physical
examination findings but should be nonseasonal;may occur concurrently
with atopy; differentiation is made by noting response to hypoallergenic diet
·Flea bite hypersensitivity-most common cause of seasonal pruritus in many
geographic regions;may occur concurrently with atopy; differentiation is
madebynotinglesiondistribution,responsetofleacontrol,andresults ofin
tradermal skin testing
·Sarcoptic mangeoften occurs in young or stray dogs;usually causes severe
pruritus of the ventral chest,lateral elbows,lateral hocks,and pinnal mar-
gins;multiple skin scrapings and/or complete response to a trial of miticidal
therapy are indicated to rule out sarcoptic mange
250

·Secondarypyoderma-usually caused byStaphylococcus intermedius;char-
acterized by follicular papules,pustules,crusts,and epidermal collarettes
·Secondary yeast infectionsusually caused by Malassezia pachydermatis;
characterizedbyrythmatous,scaly,rusty,reasyandvrymalodorou
body folds and intertriginous areas; demonstration of numerous budding

Diagnostics
·Eosinophilia-rare in dogs without concurrent flea infections; common in
cats
ATOPY-IDENTIFY CAUSES
·Airborne pollens (grasses, weeds, and trees)
·Mold spores (indoor and outdoor)
·House dust mite
·Animal danders
·Insects (controversial)
SEROLOGIC ALLERGY TESTS
·Tests to measure the amount ofallergen-specificIgE antibody in thepatient's
serum arecommercially available.
·Advantages over IDST—availability;large areas of hair do not have to be
shaved
·Disadvantages-frequent false-positive reactions; limited number of allergens
tested;inconsistent assay validation and quality control (may vary with the
laboratory used)
·Reliability in cats is unknown.
IDST
· Small amounts of test allergens are injected intradermally and wheal forma-
tion is measured.
·Most accurate method of identifying offending allergens for possible avoid-
ance or inclusion in an immunotherapy prescription
·Results are sometimes difficult to interpret in cats owing to the relatively
small wheals.
·Skin biopsy-may help rule out other differential diagnoses; results are usu
ally not pathognomonic.Dermatohistopathologic changes-acanthosis,
mixedmononuclear superficialperivascular dermatitis,sebaceous gland
metaplasia,and secondary superficialpyoderma
Therapeutics
·Essential fatty acid supplementation may be beneficial in some cases.
Atopy
251
IMMUNOTHERAPY(HYPOSENSITIZATION)
·Administration (usually SC injections) of gradually increasing doses of the
causative allergens toaffectedpatients inan attempt toreduce their sensitiv-
ity
·Allergens selectedbased on allergy test results,patient history,andknowl
edge oflocalflora
·Indicated when it isdesirable to avoid orreduce the amount of corticosteroids
required tocontrol signs,when signslastlonger than46monthsperyear,or
when nonsteroidal forms of therapy are ineffective
·Successfully reduces pruritus in 60-80%of dogs and cats
·The response is usually slow, often requiring 3-6 months to up to 1 year.
CORTICOSTEROIDS
·Maybegivenforshort-termrelief and tobreak theitch-scratch cycle
·Should be tapered to the lowest dosage that adequately controlspruritus
·Best choices—prednisone suspension(0.5 to 1.0mg/kg SCor IM);prednisone
or methylprednisolone tablets (0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg PO q48h)
·Repository injectable corticosteroids should be avoided in dogs.
·Cats may require methylprednisolone acetate treatment (4 mg/kg SC or IM).
ANTIHISTAMINES
·Less effective than are corticosteroids
·Efficacy as a sole treatment is probably in the 10-20% range.
·May act synergisticallywith essential fatty acid supplements
· Corticosteroid therapy can often be avoided or given at a reduced dosage
when used concurrently.
·Dogs-hydroxyzine (1-2mg/kgPOq8h),chlorpheniramine (0.2-0.4mg/kg
POq12h),diphenhydramine(2.2mg/kg PO q8h),and clemastine(0.04-0.10
mg/kg PO q12h)
·Cats-chlorpheniramine (0.5 mg/kg PO q12h);efficacy estimated at
10-50%
PRECAUTIONS
·Corticosteroids--use judiciously in dogs to avoid iatrogenic hyperglucocorti-
cism andassociatedproblems,aggravationofpyoderma,and induction of de-
modicosis
Antihistamines-can produce drowsiness,anorexia,vomiting,diarrhea,and
even increasedpruritus;usewithcautioninpatientswith cardiac arrhythmias
The antihistamine astemizolehasbeenassociatedwithlife-threateningcar
diacarrhythmiasinhumans when administered concomitantly with imida-
zole antifungal drugs.
ALTERNATIVEDRUGS
●Frequent bathing in cool water with antipruritic shampoos can be beneficial.
·Supplementation with -3and o-6fatty acids helps some pruritic patients;
some studies have indicated that @-3(eicosapentaenoic acid 66mg/kg/day)
may be more effective than w-6(linoleic acid 130 mg/kg/day);other studies
suggest that a 5:1 ratio of w-6:o-3 in the diet is indicated.
252
The 5-MinuteVeterinary ConsultClinical Companion
·Tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin 1.0-2.0 mg/kgPO q12h;or amitriptyline
1.0-2.0 mg/kg POq12h) have been given to dogs as antipruritics but their
overall effectivenessand mode of action is unclear;not extensively studied in
the cat
Comments
·Explain the progressive nature of the condition.
·Inform client that it rarely goes into remission and cannot be cured.
·Inform client that some form of therapy may be necessary for life.
·Examine patient every 2-8 weeks when a new course of therapy is started.
·Monitor pruritus, self-trauma,pyoderma,and possible adverse drug reac-
tions.
·Once an acceptable level of control is achieved,examine patient every 3-12
months.
·CBC, serum chemistry profile,and urinalysis—recommended every 6-12
months for patients on chronic corticosteroid therapy.
·If the offending allergens have been identified through allergy testing,the
owner should undertake to reduce the animal's exposure as much as possible.
·Minimizing other sources of pruritus （e.g,fleas,food hypersensitivity,and
secondary skin infections) may reduce the level of pruritus enough to be tol-
erated by the animal.
·Secondary pyoderma and concurrent flea allergy dermatitis are common.
·Not life-threatening unless intractable pruritus results in euthanasia
If left untreated,the degree of pruritus worsens and the duration of signs lasts
longer each year of the animal's life.
·Only rare cases spontaneously resolve.

Gastrointestinalvomiting; diarrhea;more frequent bowel movements;flat-
ulence
·Nervous-very rare; seizures have been documented with food hypersensitiv-

Diagnostics
FOOD ELIMINATION DIET
·Definitive test for food hypersensitivity
·Tailored to the individual patient
·Thedietmust be restricted to one protein and one carbohydrate to which the
animal has had limited or no previous exposure.
·It may take up to13weeks for maximum improvement of the clinical signs.
·If the patient is sensitive to one or more foods,noticeable improvement will
be seen by the 4th week of the diet.
CHALLENGE ANDPROVOCATION DIET TRIALS
·Used if thepatient improves on the elimination diet
·Challengefeed the patient with the original diet; a return of the signs con-
firms that something in the diet is causing the signs; the challenge period
should lastuntil thesignsreturn but nolonger than10 days
·Provoke (provocation diet trial)if the challenge confirmed the presence of
gredientsncludeafullrangeofmeats（beef,chicken,fish,orklamb),afull
range of grains (corn,wheat,soybean,rice),eggs,and dairy products; the
provocation period for each ingredient should last up to10days or less if
signs develop sooner (dogs usually develop signs within 1-2 days);results
guide the selection of commercial foods that donot contain the offending
substance(s)
·Histopathological findingsvariable; common findings suggest hypersensi-
tivity;a secondary pyoderma or Malassezia infectionmay be seen
Therapeutics
·Avoid any food substances that caused the clinical signs to return during the
provocation phase of the diagnosis.
·Make sure the client understands the principles involved in each phase of the
diagnostic test diets.
·Inform client toeliminate treats,chewabletoys,vitamins,and otherchewable
medications(e.g-,heartworm preventative)that may contain ingredients
from the patient's previous diet.
Outdoor pets must be confined to prevent foraging and hunting,whichmight
alter the test diet.
·Provide handouts for clients to take home.
·Advise client that all family membersmust be aware of the test protocol and
must helpkeep the test diet clean and free of any otherfood sources.
·Systemic antipruritic drugs-may be useful during thefirst 2-3weeks of diet
trial tocontrol self-mutilation
·Antibiotics or antifungal medication-useful for secondary pyodermas or
Malasseziainfections
·Antibiotics that are known to have anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., tetracy-
cline,erythromycin,and trimethoprim-potentiated sulfas)
256
The 5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
·Glucocorticoids and antihistamines must be discontinued for at least10-14
days while on the diet trial to allow correct assessment of the animal's re-
sponse.
·Chewable vitamins and heartworm medications may contain offending food
substances.
Comments
·Examine patient and evaluate and document the pruritus and clinical signs
every 3-4 weeks.
·Avoid intake of any of the proteins included in the previous diet.
·Treats and chewable toys should be limited to known safe substances (e.g.*
apples, vegetables).
·Other causes of pruritus(e.g.,flea bite hypersensitivity; atopy; and external
parasites such as sarcoptic,Notoedres,and Cheyletiellamites)can mask the
response to the food elimination diet trial.
·Prognosis is good,if food ingredients are the only cause of the pruritus and
offending ingredients are avoided.Rarely,a dog or cat may develop hyper-
sensitivity to new substances,which may require a new elimination diet trial.
·Any other hypersensitivities (flea or atopy) must also be treated.
·Animals who develop pruritus for thefirst time at <6months or>6years
of age are more likely to have food hypersensitivity than atopy.

·Best diagnostic test-eliminate contact irritant or antigen; follow with
provocative exposure testing
·Bacterial cultures to define secondary pyoderma may be performed, if
needed.
Because thehair coatcan rotect the skinfromcontact withantigen,lipping
apatch of hair in a nonaffectedregion should result in development of a lo-
cal reaction.
·Skinbiopsies-intraepidermal vesiculation and spongiosis;superficial dermal
morphonuclear cell infiltrate in ICD; leukocyte exocytosis common
Therapeutics
·Eliminate offending substance(s).
·Bathe with hypoallergenic shampoos to remove antigen from the skin.
Create mechanical barriers,if possiblesocks,T-shirts,restriction from en-
vironment
·Systemic corticosteroids-prednisone (0.25-0.5 mg/kg PO q24h for 3-5
days;thenq48hfor 2weeks)
Topical corticosteroids for focal lesions
·Recent studies report success in dogs with pentoxifylline (10 mg/kg PO
q12h).
Pentoxifyllinedonot administer with alkylating agents,cisplatin,and am
photericin B;cimetidine may increase serumlevels of pentoxifylline
Comments
ICD
·Acute condition-may occur after only one exposure; can be manifested
within24hr ofexposure
·Steroids are rarely helpful.
·Lesions resolve 1-2 days after irritant removal.
ACD
Requires months to years of exposure for the hypersensitivity to develop.
·Re-exposure results in the development of clinical signs 3-5 days following
exposure; signsmay persist for several weeks.
·Responds well to corticosteroids; but the pruritus returns after discontinua-
tion if the antigenic stimulus has notbeen removed.
·Hyposensitization is disappointing.
Prognosis-good if the allergenisidentified andremoved;poor if the allergen
is not identified,which may then require lifelong treatment

EOSINOPHILIC
GRANULOMA
COMPLEX
AlexanderH.Werner
Definition/Overview
Cats-oftenconfusingtermfor threedistinct syndromes:eosinophilicplaque,
eosinophilicgranuloma,and indolentulcer;groupedprimarilyowingtotheir
clinicalsimilaritiestheirfrequentconcurrentdevelopment,andtheirpositive
responsetocorticosteroids
·Dogs-eosinophilic granulomas in dogs (EGD) rare;not part of disease com-
plex;specific differences from catsarelisted separately
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Eosinophilic plaque-hypersensitivity reaction,most often to insects(fleas,
mosquitos);lessoften tofoodorenvironmentalallergens
Eosinophilic granuloma-multiple causes,including hypersensitivity andge
netic predisposition
·Indolent ulcer-mayhave both hypersensitivity and genetic causes
·Eosinophil-major infiltrative cell for eosinophilic granuloma and
eosinophilic plaque;leukocyte located in greatest numbers in epithelial tis-
sues;most often associated with allergic orparasitic conditions,but has a
more generalroleintheinflammatoryreaction
·EGD-may haveboth agenetic predisposition anda hypersensitivity cause
·Several reports of related affected individualsand a study of diseasedevelop-
mentinacolonyofspecificpathogen-freecatsindicatethat,inatleastsome
individuals,genetic predisposition (perhaps resultingin a heritable dysfunc-
tion of eosinophilic regulation) is a significant component of the disease.

The 5-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion
Signalment/History
·Restricted to cats-—EGC
Eosinophilic granulomas occur in dogs and other species,but arenot consid
ered part of this disease complex.
·EGD-Siberianhuskies(76%of cases)
·Eosinophilic plaque-2-6 years of age
Genetically initiated eosinophilic granuloma-<2years of age
·Allergic disorder->2 years of age
Indolent ulcer—no age predisposition reported
·EGD-usually <3 years of age
·Cats-predilection for females has been reported only for the indolent ulcer
·EGDmales (72% of cases)
·Distinguishing among the syndromes depends on both clinical signs and
histopathologic findings.
·Lesions of more than one syndrome may occur simultaneously.
·Lesions of all three syndromes may develop spontaneously and acutely.
·Development of eosinophilic plaques can be preceded by periods of lethargy.
·A seasonal incidence is common.
·Waxing and waning of clinical signs is common in all three syndromes.
Clinical Features
Eosinophilic plaques-alopecic,erythematous,erosive patches and plaques;
usuallyoccurin theinguinalerineallateral thighandaxillaryregionsfe-
quently moist or glistening (Figs.38-1,38-2)
·Eosinophilic granulomas-occur in a distinctly linear orientation (linear
granuloma) on the caudal thigh,or as individual or coalescing plaques lo-
cated anywhere on the body, ulcerated with a “cobblestone" or coarse pat-
tern; white oryellow,ossiblyrepresenting collagen degeneration;lipmargin
and chin swelling (pouting”）; footpad swelling,pain,and lameness; oral
cavityulcerations (especially on thetongue,palate,and palatine arches);cats
with oral lesions may be dysphagic,have halitosis, and may drool. (Fig.
38-3)
Lesiondevelopmentmay stop spontaneouslyin some catsespecially withthe
heritable form of eosinophilic plaque.
·Indolent ulcers-classically raised and indurated ulcerations confined to the
upper lips adjacent to the philtrum (Figs. 38-4, 38-5)
·EGDlesions are ulcerated plaques and masses; dark or orange color
Differential Diagnosis
·Includes the other diseases in the complex
·Unresponsive lesions-exclude pemphigus foliaceus,dermatophytosis and
deep fungal infection,demodicosis,pyoderma,and neoplasia (especially
metastatic adenocarcinoma and cutaneous lymphosarcoma)

Diagnostics
·CBC-mildtomoderateeosinophilia
Biochemistry andurinalysisusually normal
·FeLVandFIV-pruritic diseases have been associatedwith theseviruses
·Impression smearsfromlesions--largenumbersofeosinophils
Comprehensive flea and insect controlassist in excluding flea ormosquito
bite hypersensitivity
Food-elimination trial-for all cases;feed a protein (e.g,lamb,pork,veni
son,orrabbit) to which the cat has never been exposed;use exclusively for
8-10weeks;then reinstitute previous diet andobserve for development of
new lesions
·Environmental allergy(atopy)identifiedby intradermal skin testing(some
cases);inject small amounts of dilute allergens intradermally;positive reac-
tion(allergy) is indicated by the development of a hive orwheal at the injec-
tion site
·Invitro serum tests-available foridentifyingallergy-specific serum in cats;
tests have notbeenvalidatedand arenotrecommended
·Histopathologicdiagnosis-requiredfor distinguishing the syndromes
·Biopsy samples fromindolentulcersfrequently fail torevealeosinophils.
·Eosinophilic plaque-severe epidermaland follicular acanthosis with
eosinophilic exocytosis andspongiosis;intense eosinophilic dermal infiltrate
common;epidermiscommonly eroded orulcerated
·Eosinophilicgranuloma-distinct fociof eosinophilicdegranulation andcol-
lagen degeneration similar togranuloma formation;epidermismaybe eroded
orulcerated
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinical Companion
266
·Indolent ulcer-earlylesions may be indistinguishable from those of
eosinophilic granuloma (eosinophilic infiltration and collagen degeneration);
late-stagelesionscharacterizedbyfibrosiswithperivascularneutrophilicand
mononuclearinfiltration
·EGD-foci of collagen degeneration with palisading granulomas;
eosinophilic andhistiocyticinfiltration
Therapeutics
·Mostpatients can be treated as outpatients unless severe oral disease prevents
adequate fluid intake.
·Try to identify and eliminate offending allergen(s)before providing medical
intervention.
·Hyposensitization of intradermal skin test-positive cats-may be successful
in 60-73%ofcases;preferable tolong-term corticosteroidadministration
Discourage patient from damaging lesions by excessive grooming.
EGC-CAT
·Injectablemethylprednisone—20mg/cat,repeat in 2weeks(if needed);most
common treatment
·Corticosteroids—ongoing treatmentwith prednisone (3-5mg/kgq48h)
rarely required to control lesions; steroid tachyphylaxis may occur and may
be specificto the drug administered;maybe useful to change the formulation;
other drugs: dexamethasone (0.1-0.2mg/kg q24-72h)and triamcinolone
(0.1-0.2mg/kg q24-72h);higher induction dosages may be required but
should be tapered as quickly as possible
·Combination of oral corticosteroids and selective immunosuppressive
agents—for severe lesions; e.g.,chlorambucil (0.1-0.2 mg/kg q24-48h)
·Chrysotherapy with aurothioglucose—1 mg/kg IM every 7 days;mixed re-
sults
·Cyclophosphamide--1 mg/kgq24h for 4 out of every 7 days;another alter-
native
·α-interferon-30-60 U daily in cycles of 7days on,7days off;limited suc-
cess; side effects rare;no specific treatment monitoringrequired
Antibiotics-trimethoprim-sulfadiazine(15mg/kg POq12h),cephalexin(22
mg/kgPOq12h),or amoxicillin trihydrate-clavulanate(12.5mg/kg PO
q12h);effective in some cases;preferable tolong-term corticosteroid admin-
istration;response maybe the result of the anti-inflammatory activity of these
drugsratherthan their primary bactericidal properties
Radiation,surgical excision,and immunomodulation(e.g.,levamisole,bac
terin injections)occasional reports of success
·COlaser-newer treatment modality;may offer relief from individual or
painful lesions,especially those in the mouth
·Topical—application of potent corticosteroid ointments may helpwith iso-
lated lesionsbut israrelypractical
·Megestrol acetate-2.5-5 mg every 2-7 days; can be effective inrare cases;
notrecommended becauseof the severity ofpossible side effects
EGD-DoG
·Oral prednisone-0.5-2.2mg/kg/day initially; then taper gradually
·Cessation of therapy without recurrence is common.
EosinophilicGranuloma Complex
267
Comments
·Corticosteroids-baseline and frequent hemograms,serum chemistry pro-
files,and urinalyses
·Selective immunosuppressant drugs--frequent hemograms(biweekly at first,
then monthly or bimonthly as therapy continues)to monitor for bone mar-
row suppression;routine serum chemistry profiles andurinalyses(monthly at
first,then every 3months)tomonitor for complications （renal disease,dia-
betes mellitus,and urinary tract infection)
·If a primary cause (allergy)can be determined and controlled,lesions should
resolvepermanently,unless the animal re-encounters the offending allergen.
Most lesionswax andwane,with orwithout therapy;thus,an unpredictable
schedule of recurrence should be anticipated.
·Drug dosages should be tapered to the lowest possible level (or discontinued,
ifpossible)once thelesionshaveresolved.

HYPEREOSINOPHILIC
SYNDROME
Karen M. Young
Overview/Definition
Idiopathicpersistent eosinophilia caused by sustained overproduction of
eosinophils in the bonemarrow
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Hypothesizedto be caused by severereaction to an undefined antigen or dys-
regulation of immunologiccontrol of eosinophil production
·Multisystemic syndrome with invasion of tissues by eosinophilsand subse-
quent organ damage and dysfunction,leadingto death
·Organ damage caused by effects of cosinophil granule products and
eosinophil-derived cytokines that arereleasedin the tissues from activated or
necroticcells
·Probably includes a heterogeneousgroupof disorders
·Common sites of infiltration-gastrointestinal tract (especially intestine and
liver),spleen,and lymph nodes (especially mesentericnodes)
Lesscommon sitesof infiltration-skin,kidney,heart,thyroid,lung,adrenal
glands,and pancreas
Signalment/History
Cats-may occurmore frequently in female,middle-aged,domesticshorthair
animals than in others
268
HypereosinophilicSyndrome
269
·Dogs—rare and incompletely described
·Lethargy
·Anorexia
●Intermittent vomiting and diarrhea
·Weight loss
Less frequently—fever,pruritus, and seizures
Clinical Features
·Fever
·Emaciation
Hepatosplenomegaly
●Thickened (diffuse or segmental) intestine that is nonpainful
·Mesenteric,andpossibleperipheral,lymphadenopathy
·Mass lesions caused by eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation involving
lymph nodes or organs
·Pruritic erythroderma
Differential Diagnosis
Identifiable causes of eosinophiliaparasitism,hypersensitivity disorder,in-
fectious disease,immune-mediateddisease,andneoplasia;with these condi
tions,eosinophilia isusually limited in degree andremains confined toa spe-
cific organ, such as the lungs in feline asthma
·Eosinophilic leukemiadistinction is controversial; differentiating criteria of
this leukemia:(1)immature eosinophils seen in higher numbers in the circu-
lation and constitute a higher percentage of the leukocyte differential;(2) ane-
mia more common;(3)myeloid:erythroid ratio inbone marrow is higher(>
10:1)and blast forms aremore numerous;(4)tissue infiltrates consist of im-
mature eosinophils and may show a sinusoidalpattern in theliverwithout fi-
brosis;(5) in cats,chloroma-like masses in thekidneys reported
Diagnostics
Leukocytosis with eosinophilia(usually marked）,possibly with a left shift in
the eosinophil series; eosinophil count range:3,200-130,000 cells/μL
●Basophilia
·Anemia in some animals
·In animals with organ dysfunction,biochemical abnormalities may be seen.
Rule outidentifiable causes of eosinophiliafecal flotation,heartworm test,
fungal culture, and biopsy to detect neoplasm
·Intestinal mucosalirregularities and thickened intestine seen on radiographic
contrast studies
·Bonemarrow——hypercellularity,eosinophilic hyperplasia (up to 40% of nu-
cleated cells consist of eosinophils),lack of morphologic abnormalities,and
high myeloid:erythroid ratio(mean 7.27:1)
·Biopsyof affectedorgan or mass
270
The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
Spleen-eosinophilic infiltrate in red pulp,sometimes in white pulp
·Gastrointestinal tract-mucosal and submucosaleosinophilic infiltrates in
small intestine,sometimes incolonand stomach
·Lymph nodes-reactive hyperplasia and infiltration of cords and sinuses with
eosinophils
·Heart-eosinophilic infiltrates in themyocardium and endocardium;fibrosis
and thrombusformation
Lessrequntlysinophililtrateintheskinliver,unganreask
ney,adrenal,and thyroid gland
Therapeutics
·Use long-termmaintenance therapy to control or reduce the eosinophilia and
organ damage.
·Massive tissue infiltration impedes treatment and usually lends a poor prog-
nosis.
·High serum IgE concentration portends a good response to treatment with
prednisone and a better prognosis.
Corticosteroidsprednisolone,1-3mg/kg/day initially; then taper to alter-
nate-day administration if eosinophilia is suppressed;if eosinophilia returns,
resume higher daily dose.
·Chemotherapeutic agents-try if eosinophilia is steroid resistant,but the
paucity of case reports describing these therapies precludes recommending
their use
·Hydroxyurea(inhibits DNA synthesis)administer toreduce the eosinophil
count if not normal or near normal after 7-14 days of treatment with
steroids;most likely would beused long-termif effective in conjunction with
steroids
Vincristine and alkylating agents,such as chlorambucil,effective nhumans
·Reduce dosage or discontinue drug if bone marrow suppression or thrombo
cytopenia develops.
Comments
·Aggressive cytotoxic therapy has been deleterious in some human patients.
·Monitor eosinophil count (not always indicative of tissue infiltrates) and
myelosuppression if chemotherapeutic drugs are used.
Monitor clinical signs(e.g.,anorexia,lethargy,vomiting,and diarrhea）and
any physical abnormalities.

The5-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion
Clinical Features
·Pruritus-can be activated by awide variety ofcompounds;most common
symptom of drug eruption in humans
·Macular and papular rashes-commonly accompany pruritus as a nonspe-
cificsign ofinflammation
·Exfoliative erythroderma-a diffuse erythematous response caused by va-
sodilation;often leads to exfoliation(diffuse scaling)
·Urticaria/angioedema—results from an immediate (type I)hypersensitivity;
requires prior sensitization;increased vascular permeability leads to fluid
leakageinto the interstitium
·Hypersensitivity vasculitis-inflammation of cutaneous vasculature;results
in poor blood flow and anoxic injury to recipient tissue; in most cases,
thought to represent a type III hypersensitivity response
·Erythema multiforme (EM)-macules or plaques expand peripherally and
may clear in the center,producing a bull's-eye appearance; multiple
shapes/forms can be seen
·Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis(TEN)-extensive necrosis and sloughing of the
epidermis in sheets;results in a moist and intensely inflamed skin surface
·Drug-induced pemphigus/pemphigoid—-least common drug reaction in ani-
mals; can closely mimic the autoimmune (spontaneous)forms of these dis-
eases
Differential Diagnosis
·Pruritus,macular/papular rashes,and urticaria/angioedema-allergic dis-
eases(atopy,food allergy,contact allergy)and reactionstoectoparasites(sca
bies,fleabite allergy，stinginginsects)
·Exfoliative erythroderma-rule out cutaneousT cell lymphoma in old dogs
andcats
Vasculitisinfectious,neoplastic,andautoimmune diseases;many cases of
vasculitis are idiopathic
·EM-rule outrespiratory infections and internal neoplasms.
Pemphigus/pemphigoid-consider drug reaction whenever these diseases are
diagnosed;however, spontaneously occurring autoimmune disease is much
more common
Diagnostics
·When cutaneous vasculitis is suspected or diagnosedpotential for concur-
rent hepatic,renal,and gastrointestinal disease
·Dogs with vasculitis-rickettsial serology,ANA
·Cats with vasculitis-FIV andFeLV serology
·Bacterial and fungal cultures and sensitivity testingfor vasculitis with pyo-
granulomatousinflammation
·Skinbiopsy for histopathology-mandatory for diagnosis of most drug-in-
duced diseases (vasculitis,EM,TEN,pemphigus/pemphigoid)
Cutaneous Drug Eruption
273
Therapeutics
·Discontinue use of the offending drug.
·TENintensive supportive care and fluid/nutritional support because of
fluid andprotein exudation and risk of sepsis
·Corticosteroids-controversial
Comments
·Inpatient-if debilitated
Outpatientregular rechecks,depending on physical condition
·Some reactions appear to activate self-perpetuating immune responses.
●Some drug metabolites may persist for days to weeks and provoke a contin-
ued response.
·TEN—prognosispoor
·Vasculitis-prognosis guarded when there are systemic complications.Asso-
ciatedwith arthropathy,hepatitis,glomerulonephritis,and neuromuscular
disorders,among others

SEPSISANDBACTEREMIA
Sharon K. Fooshee
Definition/Overview
·Bacteremia-defined as the presence of bacterial organisms in the blood-
stream
Sepsis-systemicresponse to bacterial infection（e.g.,fever,hypotension）
Terms arenot synonymous,althoughoften used interchangeably
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Shedding ofbacterial organisms into the bloodstream-may occur tran-
siently,intermittently,orcontinually
·Themost critical hostresponse forelimination of bacteremia-providedby
mononuclearphagocyte system of the spleen and liver;activation leads to re-
lease ofnumerous cellular mediators (cytokines),some ofwhich are benefi-
cialandothersdetrimental;mayleadtodeathofthehost
·Neutrophils-relatively moreimportant for defense against extravascular in-
fection
Bacteremia-transient,subclinicaleventormayescalatetoovertsepsiswhen
theimmunesystemisoverwhelmed;generallyof morepathologic significance
when thebloodstream is invadedfromvenous or lymphaticdrainagesites
·With peracute developmentof septicemia-increasedor decreasedcardiac
output,decreasedsystemicvascularresistance,andincreasedvascular per
meability;ultimately,refractoryhypotensiondevelops,leadingtomultiorgan
failure and death
277
278
The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
·Endocarditis-may develop; presence of bacteremia alone is not sufficient for
induction;multiple factors involving both the host and the bacterial organ-
ismmust befavorable for bacterial adherence to heart valves
·Coagulation disorders and thromboembolism
·Kidney and myocardium especially prone to septic embolization
·With chronic bacteremiaantigenic stimulation of the immune systemmay
lead to immune-complex deposition
Dogs—gram-negative organisms (especially Escherichia coli)most common;
gram-positive cocciand obligate anaerobes also important； polymicrobial in-
fectionreportedinabout 20%of dogswithpositiveblood cultures
·Cats-bloodstream pathogens usually gram-negative bacteria from the En-
terobacteriaceae family orobligate anaerobes;Salmonellamost common
gram-negative organism cultured
·Pseudomonas aeruginosauncommon isolate from animal blood cultures
Signalment/History
·Dogs and cats
·No age, sex, or breed predispositions reported
·Large-breed male dogs-predisposed to bacterial endocarditis and dis-
cospondylitis
·Development may be acute or may occur in a vague or episodic fashion.
Variable andmay involve multiple organ systems
·May be confusedwith those of immune-mediated disease
Clinicalmore severe when gram-negative organisms are involved
·Dogs that develop overt sepsisthe earliest signs are usually referable to the
gastrointestinal tract
Cats--respiratory system more commonly involved
Clinical Features
·Intermittent or persistent fever
·Lameness
·Depression
·Tachycardia
·Heart murmur
·Weakness
·Consider other causes of fever,heart murmur,joint or back pain, or hy-
potension.
·Clinical signs of more chronicbacteremia may be confused with immune-me-
diated disease.
Diagnostics
·Identify risk factors
·Peracute—pyometra and disruption of the gastrointestinal tract most often
associated
More protracted onsetinfections of the skin,upper urinary tract,oral cav
ity,and prostate
SepsisandBacteremia
279
Hyperadrenocorticism,diabetes mellitus,liver orrenal failure,splenectomy,
malignancy,andburns-predisposingfactors
Immunodeficient statechemotherapy,FIV,splenectomy;particularrisk
·Glucocorticoids-considered animportant riskfactor forbacteremia;allows
greatermultiplication of bacteria in extravascular tissues
·Intravenous catheter-providesrapid venous access for bacteria
·Indwellingurinary catheters-maybe apredisposingfactor
·Neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift and an associated monocytosis-
mostcommonhematologicabnormalities
·Neutropenia-may develop
·Hypoalbuminemia anda highALP (up to two times upper limit of normal)
up to50% of affected dogs
·Hypoglycemia-about 25%ofaffected dogs
·With suspected catheter-induced sepsissubmit catheter tip for culture
·Urine culturemay be useful; positive culture does not determine if urinary
tract is primary or secondary source of infection
·Mayidentify source of bacteremia (e.g.,pyometra) or secondarily infected or-
gans(e.g.,discospondylitis)
BLOOD CULTURE
·Indications—any patient that develops fever (or hypothermia),leukocytosis
(especiallywithaleft shift),neutropenia,shiftingleglameness,recent-onset
or changingheart murmur,or any sign of sepsis that cannot be explained
·Essential for confirming suspected bacteremia and for optimizing manage
ment of thepatient;one study of critically illanimalsreported approximately
75%of cats and 50% of dogs had positive blood cultures.
·Clinical findings-notreliablefor discriminatingbetweenparticulartypes of
bacteria
Guidelines
· Current antimicrobial therapy—does not preclude collection of blood cul-
tures; advise laboratory that patient is receiving antibiotics; steps can be
taken to inactivate certain medications
·Anaerobic culturesspecial bottles may not be necessary
·Sets (pairs)of samples-inform laboratory that for each submitted pair of
bottles,one is foraerobic culture and the other for anaerobic
·Collect at least two(and preferably three) sets of samples-improves chance
of obtaining a positive culture and facilitates interpretation of results
·Volumethe greater thevolume of collectedblood,thebetter the chances of
obtaining positive cultures;often,only a few organisms present permilliliter
of blood;10mL of blood per culture recommended;may not be possible for
cats and small dogs;have an assortment of culture bottles available (includ-
ing25,50,and100mL);small bottlesusefulfor smallpatients formaintain
ing appropriate blood-to-culture broth ratio
·Timing-formost patients, sufficient to take three cultures over a 24-hr pe-
riod;for critically illpatients,take three cultures over a 2-hr period
Collection
·Bottles-warm to room temperature; apply alcohol or iodine to the rubber
stopper
280
The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
·Patientclip hair; thoroughly disinfect skin before venipuncture,to avoid
contamination;wipe with 70% alcohol, then apply an iodine-based disinfec-
tant;allow a minimum of 1 min of contact time with the skin
·Withdrawing blood-wearing a sterile glove,palpate the vein; draw blood
into a sterile syringe; evacuate all air from the syringe; attach a new needle be-
foreinoculatingblood into thebottles
·Samples-maintain culture bottles atroom temperature for transport to the
laboratory
Media
Commercial multipurpose nutrient broth media-recommended
·Amedium that supports growth of both aerobes and anaerobes-ideal
·Often, the laboratory that processes the culture will supply culture bottles.
Interpretation ofResults
·Single positive culture-not possible to distinguish true bacteremia from
samplecontamination
·Two or more positive cultures identified as the same organism desired
ter—probably contamination
Enterobacteriaceae,Bacteroidaceae,Pseudomonasaeruginosa,Stapbylococ-
chs aurens,Stapbylococcus intermedins,β-hemolytic streptococci,and
yeasts-nearly always clinically significant bacteremia
·Negative results from two or three successive cultures—generally eliminates
bacteremia owing to common pathogens; some less common bacteria may
take several weeksto grow
Therapeutics
·Success-requires early identification of the problem and aggressive inter-
vention; careful monitoring essential, because the status of patient may
change rapidly
·Hypotension—-intravenous fluids; isotonic fluids (e.g., lactated Ringer) at a
rate up to 90mL/kg/hr in dogs and55 mL/kg/hr in cats; use caution when hy-
poalbuminemia or increasedvascularpermeability isa concern
·Volume expanders (e.g.,hydroxyethyl starch)—may help maintain oncotic
pressure
·With hypoglycemiamay adddextrose to intravenousfluids
·Electrolytes and acid-base balance-correct abnormalities
·Abscesses--locate and drain
·External sources of infection-give appropriate attention to wound care and
bandage changes
Internal sourcesofinfectionegpyometraordisruptionofthebowel）sur-
gicalintervention essential
·Nutritional supportprovide by assisted feeding or placement of a feeding
tube
·Antibioticsusually selected before culture and sensitivity results are available;
empiric therapy acceptable while waiting for results; do not delay treatment
Sepsis andBacteremia
281
·Antimicrobialsgive intravenously; direct therapy to cover all possible bac-
terial organisms(gram-positive and-negative;aerobic and anaerobic)
dogs and cats:administer cefazolin at 40 mg/kg IV as a loading dose; then
20-30mg/kg IVq6-8h(dogs and cats)
·Aminoglycosidesadd to protocol if more aggressive therapy is warranted;
administergentamicin at 2-4mg/kgIVq8h(dogs andcats)
Comments
·Glucocorticoids and NSAIDs (controversial)）-value in treating septic shock;
do not improve survival unless given within the firstfew hours of the onset;
may complicate the clinical picture in potentially ischemic organs (e.g., gas-
trointestinal tract andkidneys)
·Aminoglycosides-use with caution with renal impairment
·Aminoglycoside therapymonitorrenal function
·Blood pressure and ECGmonitor,if indicated
·Gram-negative septicemia-highrateofmortality;death owingtohypoten
sion,electrolyte and acid-basedisturbances,and endotoxemic shock
·Suspected discospondylitis(dogs)—may need to screen for Brucella canis

ABSCESSATION
Johnny D. Hoskins
Definition/Overview
An abscessis a localized collection ofpurulent exudate containedwithin a cavity.
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Bacteriaare ofteninoculated under the skinvia apuncturewound;thewound
surface then seals.
·Whenbacteria and/or foreignobjects persistin thetissue,purulentexudate
forms and collects.
·Accumulation ofpurulent exudate-if notquicklyresorbed ordischargedto
anexternalsurface,stimulatesformation ofafibrouscapsule;mayeventually
lead to abscessrupture
·Prolonged delay of evacuation-formation ofafibrous abscesswall;toheal,
thecavity mustbefilledwith granulation tissue fromwhich the causative

Diagnostics
CBCnormal or neutrophilia with or without regenerative left shift.Neu-
tropenia and degenerativeleft shift if sepsis present
·Urinalysis and serum chemistry profile-depend on system affected
·Prostatic-pyuria
·Liver and/or pancreatic-high liver enzymes and/or total bilirubin
·Pancreatic (dogs)——high amylase/lipase
·Diabetes mellitus-persistent hyperglycemia and glucosuria
·FeLV and FIV-for cats with recurrent or slow-healing abscesses
·CSF evaluation-increase in cellularity and protein expected with brain ab
scess
·Adrenal function—evaluate for hyperadrenocorticism
·Radiography-soft tissue density mass in affected area;may reveal foreign
body
·Ultrasonographydetermine if mass is fluid filled or solid;determine organ
system affected;reveal flocculent-appearing fluid characteristic of pus; may
reveal foreign object
·Echocardiography-helpful for diagnosis of pericardial abscess
·CT or MRI—helpful for diagnosis of brain abscess
ASPIRATION
·Reveals a red,white,yellow, or green liquid
·Protein content->2.5-3.0g/dL
·Nucleated cell count—3,000-100,000(or more) cells/μL;primarily degener-
ativeneutrophilswithlesser numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes
·Pyogenic bacteria-may be seen in cells and free within thefluid
·If the causative agent is not readily identified with a Romanovsky-type stain,
specimens shouldbe stainedwith an acid-fast stain todetectmycobacteria or
Nocardia and PAS stain to detect fungus.
BIOPSY
·Sample should contain both normal and abnormal tissue in the same speci-
men.
·Impression smears-stained and examined
·Tissue-submit for histopathologic examination and culture
·Contact the diagnostic laboratory for specific instructions.
CULTURE
·Affected tissue and/or exudate-aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungus
·Blood and/or urineisolatebacterium responsible forpossible sepsis
·Bacterial sensitivity
Pathologic Findings
·Pus-containing mass lesion accompanied by inflammation
·Palpablevariably firm orfluctuantmass
·Ruptured—may see pus draining directly from the mass or an adjoining tract
Abscessation
285
· Exudate-large numbers of neutrophils in various stages of degeneration;
other inflammatory cells; necrotic tissue
·Surrounding tissue—congested; fibrin;large number of neutrophils; variable
number of lymphocytes; plasma cells; macrophages
·Causative agent variably detectable
Therapeutics
·Establish and maintain adequate drainage
Surgical removal of nidus of infection or foreign object(s)if necessary
Institution of appropriate antimicrobial therapy
·Apply hot packs to inflamed area as needed.
Use protective bandaging and/or Elizabethan collars as needed.
·Accumulated exudate-drain abscess; maintain drainage by medical and/or
surgical means.
·Sepsis or peritonitisaggressive fluid therapy and support
·Appropriate debridement and drainage-may need to leave the wound open
to an external surface; may need to place surgical drains
·Antimicrobial drugs-effective against the infectious agent; gain access to site
of infection
·Broad-spectrum agent--bactericidal andwith both aerobic and anaerobic ac
tivity; until results of culture and sensitivity are known; dogs and cats: amox
icillin(11-22mg/kgPOq8-12h); amoxicillin/clavulanic acid(12.5-25mg/kg
POq12h);clindamycin (5mg/kgPOq12h);and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine
(15mg/kgPOIMq12h);cats withMycoplasmaand L-forms:doxycycline
(3-5 mg/kg PO q12h)
·Aggressive antimicrobial therapy—sepsis or peritonitis
Comments
·Monitor for progressive decrease indrainage,resolution of inflammation,
and improvement of clinical signs
·Percutaneous abscesses—prevent fighting
·Anal sac abscesses-prevent impaction; consider anal saculectomy for recur-
rent cases
·Prostatic abscesses-castration possibly helpful
●Mastitis-prevent lactation (spaying)
·Periorbital abscesses-do not allow chewing on foreign object(s)
·Sepsis is complication
·Peritonitis/pleuritis if intra-abdominal or intrathoracic abscess ruptures
● Compromise of organ function
·Delayed evacuationmaylead to chronicallydrainingfistulous tracts.
·Minimal for pyogenic bacteria-zoonotic potential
·Mycobacteria and systemic fungal infections carry some potential for
zoonosis.

ANAEROBICBACTERIAL
INFECTIONS
Sharon K.Fooshee
Overview/Definition
Causedbybacteriarequiringlowoxygen tension
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Most commonly found generaBacteroides,Fusobacterium,Actinomyces,
Clostridium,andPeptostreptococcus
·Individual organismsvaryin theirpotential to withstandoxygen exposure.
Anumber of injurious toxins and enzymes may be elaborated by the organ-
isms,leadingoextensionof theinfectioninto adjacent,healthytissue
Signalment/History
·Usually causedbynormal flora of the body;a break in protective barriers al
lowsbacterialinvasion
Predisposing factorsbitewounds,dental disease,openfractures,abdominal
surgeryandforeignbodi
Clinical Features
·Determinedby thebody system involved
Certain areas of the body aremore commonly associatedwith anaerobic in-
fection,perhapsbecause of proximity tomucosal surfaces.
294
AnaerobicInfections
295
·It ispossible to overlook the potential for anaerobes to be involved in an in-
fectious process,leading to confusion in interpreting culture results and in se-
lecting inappropriate antimicrobials.
·A foul odor associated with a wound or exudative discharge
·Gas in the tissue or associated exudate
·Peritonitis,pyothorax,or pyometra
·Severe dental disease
·Wounds ordeep abscesses that donothealas anticipated
Differential Diagnosis
turesmay be negative; suspect anaerobic organisms
·Catswith nonhealing woundstest for FeLVandFIV
·Middle-aged and old animals-tumor invasion (e.g., in the gastrointestinal
tract) may be responsible for establishing infection
Diagnostics
·Neutrophilic leukocytosis and monocytosis common
·Biochemicalabnormalities depend on specific organ involvement.
·Appropriate samples—pus(1-2 mL in stoppered syringe)and tissue(mini-
mum 1-g sample)
·Proper handling of samples-minimize exposure to air when collecting and
transporting; appropriate transport devices should be on hand before the
sample iscollectedand include screw-top glassvialswith media that accept a
Culturette swab and syringes evacuated of all air and capped with a rubber
stopper.
Therapeutics
Thoracic drainageimportant with pyothorax (see specific chapter)
Hyperbaric oxygen—some potential use;maybe limited in availability
SURGERY
·Should not be delayed when anaerobes are suspected
·Generally indicated for all except pyothorax and CNS infections
Combined with systemic antimicrobial therapy-thebest chance of a positive
outcome
·Usually indicated when anaerobic organisms complicate pyometra,os-
teomyelitis,and peritonitis
·Cleanse the wound of toxins and devitalized tissue
·Enhance drainage of pus
· Improve local blood flow
·Increase oxygen tension
DRUGS
·Antimicrobial therapy aloneunlikely to be successful; poor drug penetra-
tion into exudates
The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
296
·Antibiotic selectionlargely empiric,owing to the difficulty of isolating
anaerobes and the delay in return of culture results; cytology and Gram stain-
ing of exudates may aid in selecting the initial antibiotic.
·Althoughmost anaerobicinfections are polymicrobial,antibiotic therapy tar-
geted against the anaerobes ismore likely to be successful than selecting mul-
tiple antibiotics because of the symbioticnature of the infection.
·Penicillin Gconsidered the antibiotic ofchoice(except for Bacteroides
strains)
·Amoxicillin-comparable to penicillin Gin spectrum of activity;convenient
and accessible;may beuseful to combine with clavulanic acid forBacteroides
·Cefoxitin—the only cephalosporin with reliable activity against anaerobes;
expensive
·Clindamycin-may be especially useful for respiratory tract infections
·Chloramphenicol-good tissue penetration;but bacteriostatic
·Metronidazole—useful against all clinically significant anaerobes (except
Actinomyces)
·Aminoglycosides—uniformly ineffective against anaerobes
·Trimethoprim-sulfa combinations-ineffective;poor penetration into puru-
lent exudates

Comments
·Antituberculosis and antileprosy drugsexamine at least monthly;monitor
foranorexia andweightloss
·Monitorliver enzymesmonthly.
·Instruct owners to report cutaneous lesions immediately.
·Clinicians aware of a human tuberculosis case in a household with dogs or
cats should counsel owners about the risk of reverse zoonosis.
·Tuberculosisguarded prognosis,but currently undefined because experi
ence withmodern drugsis limited
·Feline leprosy-fair prognosis,especially if lesions are amenable to surgical
excision
·Subcutaneous atypical mycobacteriosisgood for survival but guarded for
resolution;relapse after cessation of long-term antibiotic therapy occurs in>
40%of catstreatedwith single-agent therapy
Pulmonary and disseminated atypicalmycobacteriosisguarded,butmaybe

ZOONOTICPOTENTIAL
·Tuberculosis--affected domestic pets are possible serious zoonotic threats to
owners;publichealth authorities should be notified of any antemortem or
postmortem diagnosis (may be required by law); do not attempt treatment
without concurrence of public health authorities
·M.tuberclosisgreatest potential for zoonosis,especially with draining cu

·Organism-distinctive morphology in cytologic and histologic preparations;
cocci; chains often branching
Dermatophilosis

·Cytologic diagnosis-from impression smearsmade ofexudate from under
crusts orby preparation of minced crusts;mince crusts finely in a drop of wa
ter and allow to macerate several minutes;then dry the preparation and stain
withanyWright-Giemsastain
Histopathologic specimens-from crusts
CATS
·Histopathologic examination-biopsy of ulceratednodules;procedure of
choice
·Cytologic examination-exudate obtained from aspiration or swabbing of a
draining tract
·Culture of biopsy specimens-may yield the organism;facilitated if the labo-
ratory is alerted to thepossiblepresence ofDermatopbilus(aerobic,relatively
slow growing,and easily obscured by contamination)
·Culture from crusts-requires the use of special selective medium; generally
used to corroborate cytologic findings
PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS
·Dogscrusting and superficial pustular dermatitis; palisading of the crusts
with orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis; organismvisualized
within the crusts,generally without the use of special bacterial stains
·Cats-pyogranulomatous inflammation; central necrosis;fistulous tract for-
mation; organism visualized near the necrotic center of granulomas, espe
cially with gram stain
Therapeutics
·Dogs-antibacterial shampoo and gentle removal (and disposal) of crusts;
shampoomay containbenzoylperoxide,ethyl lactate,chlorhexidine,or sele
nium disulfide; one or two applications suffice in most cases
·Cats-for pyogranulomas and abscesses: surgical debridement;exploration
for foreign body； establishment of drainage for exudate;maintain effective
drainage andpostoperativewound care
DRUGS
·Penicillin V10 mg/kg POq12h for 10-20 days; drug of choice
·Ampicillin-10-20mg/kgPOq12hfor10-20 days
·Amoxicillin-10-20mg/kgPOq12hfor10-20days
Tetracycline,doxycycline,orminocycline—standard dosage
Comments
·Dogs--re-examine after 2weeks of treatment to ensure complete resolution
of symptoms;give an additional 7days of systemic therapy
·Cats-monitor biweekly for 1 month after apparent resolution of lesions,de
pendingon their location
·Dogs-excellent prognosis
The 5-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion
308
·Cats-prognosis varies with the location of lesions and extent of surgical
debridement；complete resolution can be achievedwith timely diagnosis and
appropriate surgicalandmedical therapy
·Veterinarians and animal care workersvery seldom infected, even after
traumatic exposure when working with farm animals known to be infected
·Dogs and cats-very unlikely to serve as a source for human infection; cau-
tion is warranted for exposure of immunocompromised individuals

Diagnostics
·Neutrophilicleukocytosis
·Nonregenerative anemiawith longstanding infections (anemia of chronic
disease)
·Chemistries-usually normal;hypergammaglobulinemia may be seen with
longstanding infections
·Radiographsmay reveal pleural or peritoneal effusion, pleuropneumonia,
or osteomyelitis
·Cytology-thoracentesis or abdominocentesis for samples; stain these or
other exudates with Romanowsky,Gram,and modified acid-fast stains for
rapid diagnosis;may revealgram-positive branching filamentous rods and
cocci; cannot be distinguished from Actinonryces spp.
Culture-diagnostic;aerobic culturing on Sabouraud medium
·N. asteroidesmore suppurative pyogranulomatous reaction than with Acti-
nomyces spp.
·N.brasiliensisgranulomatous reaction with extensive fibrosis
·Although the organism is usually present,it cannot be distinguished
histopathologicallyfrom Actinomyces spp.
Therapeutics
·Pleural or peritoneal effusions and disseminated form-inpatientuntil clini-
cally stable and effusion removed;fluid therapy forrehydration andmainte-
nance often needed
·Long-term antibiotic therapy and drainingfistulous tracts-outpatient
·Diet-encourage consumption by offering foods with appealing tastes and
smells; forced enteral feeding for anorectic inpatients essential; orogastric
tube feeding preferred
·Surgerywhen feasible,surgical drainage should accompany medical ther
apy;important to placea thoracostomytube for pleuraleffusion;attempt sur
gical drainage and debridement of draining tracts and lymph nodes;take care
to identify foreign bodies
DRUGS
·Cultured organism-antibiotic sensitivity testing
No culture or results pending—good first-choice drugs: sulfonamides (e.g.,
sulfadiazineat100mg/kgIV,POas aloadingdosefollowed by50mg/kgIV,
POq12h)and sulfonamide-trimethoprim combinations(30mg/kgPOq24h)
·Aminoglycosides—gentamicin (3 mg/kg IV, IM, SC q8h); amikacin (6.5
mg/kg IV,IM,SCq8h)
·Tetracyclines-doxycycline(10mg/kgPOq24h);tetracycline hydrochloride
(15-20mg/kgPOq8h）;minocycline (5-12.5mg/kgPOq12h)
·Erythromycin—10-20mg/kgPOq8h;orcombinedwith ampicillin(20-40
mg/kg POq8h)or amoxicillin (6-20 mg/kgPOq8-12h)
·Amoxicillin plus an aminoglycoside-synergistic combination; consider in
any serious infection when culturing is not possible or is pending
·Average treatment period is 6weeks;however,medical treatment should ex-
tend several weeks past apparent remission of the disease.
Nocardiosis

Comments
·Tetracyclines (cats)may cause fever up to 41.5°C(107°F);discontinue and
replace if fever increases during therapy
·Monitor carefully for fever,weightloss,seizures,dyspnea,and lameness the
first year after apparently successful therapybecause of thepotential forbone
and CNS involvement.

·Identify and treat any predisposing factors or diseases.
·Topical therapy-yeast is principally located in the stratum corneum
·Shampoo treatment-remove scale,exudation,andmalodor
·Topical therapies with trial data—(miconazole, selenium sulfides); twice-
weekly treatments effective
·Other topicalantifungal and antibacterial shampoo treatments may alsobe
ofvalue if given with suitable systemic drugs.
·Alternative combinations-topical keratolytic shampoo treatment with sys-
temic antiyeast and antibacterial drugs
·Localized cases-may respond to creams and lotions containingimidazole
compounds
·Ketoconazole—10mg/kg q24h for 2-4weeks;widespread or chronic licheni-
fied cases
·Chronic lichenified cases-—ketoconazole at 5-10 mg/kg q24h as a short diag-
nostic for 5-7days with effective topical antimycotic shampoo treatment;
quickresponse confirmsthediagnosis;response canbe slowin chronic cases
when yeasts areburied deep in epidermal folds
·Topicalantimicrobial shampootomaintain remission in chronic cases
Comments
·Ketoconazole—rarely may cause hepatic reaction;will mask the signs of hy-
peradrenocorticism and interfere with adrenal function tests;contraindicated
in pregnancy
·Physical examinations and skin cytology findings after 2-4weeks to monitor
therapy
·Treat until only rare organisms can be demonstrated or 7 days after a com-
plete response is achieved.
·Pruritus and odor-usually noticeably improved within 1 week
·Recurrences-common when underlyingdermatoses arenot well controlled;

Signalment
·Cats-more common in long-haired breeds(Fig.49-1)
·Clinical signs-morecommon in young animals
Althoughubiquitous,theincidence is higherin hot and humidregions.
·Lesionsmaybegin as alopecia or a poor hair coat.
A history ofpreviously confirmed infectionorexposure toaninfectedanimal
or environment (e.g.,a cattery) is a useful but not consistent finding.
RISK FACTORS
·Immunocompromisingdisease orimmunosuppressivemedication
High population density
·Poor nutrition
·Poormanagementpractices
·Lack of an adequatequarantine period
Vary from aninapparent carrier state toa patchy orcircular alopecia
Classic circular alopecia-common in cats;often misinterpreted in dogs (Fig.
49-2)
Scales,erythema,hyperpigmentation,and pruritus-variable(Fig.49-3)
·Paronychosis,granulomatous lesions,orkerionsmay occur.
Differential Diagnosis
·Cats-miliary dermatitis and almost any other dermatitis
Dogs-folliculitis,furunculosis,and most cases of alopecia

gest demodicosis;these characteristics are not consistent;concurrent bacterial
or mite infections can be seen with dermatophytosis;all three diseases can
causefocal hyperpigmentation
·Immune-mediated skin diseases-severe inflammation associated with der-
matophytosis affecting theface or feet
Diagnostics
·Reliance on clinical signs and incorrectly interpretedWood’s lamp examina-
tion results in overdiagnosis.
FUNGAL CULTURE WITH MACROCONIDIA IDENTIFICATION
·Bestmeans of confirming diagnosis
·Hairs that exhibit a positive apple-greenfluorescence underWood’s lamp ex-
amination are considered ideal candidates for culture.
·Pluck hairs from the periphery of an alopecic area; do not use a random pat
tern.
·Use a sterile toothbrush tobrush the hair coat of an asymptomatic animal to
yield better results.
Test media--change to red when they become alkaline; dermatophytes typi-
cally produce this color during the early growing phase of their culture;
saprophytes,whichalsoproduce thiscolor,do sointhelate growing phase;
thus, it is important to examine the media daily.
·Microscopic examination of the macroconidia—necessary to confirm
pathogenic dermatophyte and to identify genus and species;helps identify
source ofinfection
·Positive culture—-indicates existence of a dermatophyte;however,it may
have been there only transiently,as commonly occurs when the culture is ob
tained from the feet,whicharelikely tocome incontact withageophilicder-
matophyte
MICROSCOPICEXAMINATION OFHAIR
·Examination after using a clearing solution can help provide a rapid diagno
sis.
·Time-consuming and often produces false-negative results
·Use hairs that fluoresce underWood's lampillumination to increase the like
lihood of identifying thefungal hyphae associatedwith the hair shaft.
·Wood'slampexamination—not a very useful screening tool;many
pathogenic dermatophytes donot fluoresce;false fluorescence is common;
lamp should warm up fora minimum of 5min and thenbe exposed to sus-
picious lesions forup to5 min; a true positive reaction associated with M.ca
nis consists of apple-green fluorescence of the hair shaft;keratin associated
with epidermal scales and sebum will often produce a false-positive fluores-
cence
SKIN BIOPSY
·Not usually needed
·Can be helpful in confirming true invasion and infection
Dermatophytosis:KeratinophilicMycosis
323
PATHOLOGICFINDINGS
·Folliculitis,perifolliculitis,orfurunculosis
·Hyperkeratosis
·Intraepidermal pustules
·Pyogranulomatous reaction pattern
Fungal hyphae may be observed in H&E-stained sections; special stains allow
easiervisualizationof the organism.
Therapeutics
·Consider quarantine owing to the infective andzoonoticnature of the disease.
·Afatty meal improves absorption ofgriseofulvin.
·An acidmeal(add tomatojuice)enhances the absorption ofketoconazole
·Griseofulvin-most widely prescribed systemic drug;microsized formula-
tion:25-60mg/kgPOq12h for 4-6weeks;ultramicrosized formulation:
2.5-5.0 mg/kg PO q12-24h;pediatric suspension:10-25mg/kg POq12h;
gastrointestinal upset is the most common side effect;alleviate by reducing
the dose or dividing the dose for more frequent administration
·A fatty meal improves absorption of griseofulvin.
·Ketoconazole-not labeled for use in dogs or cats in the U.S., dose: 10 mg/kg
PO q24h or divided twice per day for 3-4weeks; anorexia is the most com-
mon side effect
·An acid meal (add tomato juice) enhances the absorption of ketoconazole.
GRISEOFULVIN PRECAUTIONS
·Bone marrow suppression (anemia,pancytopenia,and neutropenia) can oc-
cur as an idiosyncratic reaction or with prolonged therapy.
·Neutropenia-most common fatal reaction in cats;can persist after discon-
tinuation of drug; weekly or biweekly CBC is recommended;can be life
threatening in cats with FIV infection
·Neurologic side effects
·Do not use during the first two trimesters of pregnancy;it is teratogenic.
KETOCONAZOLE PRECAUTIONS
·Hepatopathy has been reported and can be quite severe.
·Inhibits endogenous production of steroidal hormones in dogs
MISCELLANEOUS
·Vaccination-product literature claims are based on clinical signs and
Wood’s lamp findings;may be useful as an adjuvant to systemic therapy; may
be valuable for treating asymptomatic carriers,which can be frustrating to
the client and veterinarian and can complicate the diagnosis and manage-
ment; studies involving dermatophyte cultures as a measure of achieving a
cure or prevention are necessary to ensure true efficacy.
·Topical therapy and clippingonce strongly advocated;may help prevent en-
vironmental contamination; often associated with an initial exacerbation of
signs after the procedures are initiated;lime sulfur (1:16),enilconazole (bot-
tle dilution),and miconazole shampoo are themost effectiveagents;lime sul-
fur is odiferous and can stain; enilconazole is not available in the U.s.
324
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinical Companion
ALTERNATIVEDRUGS
Itraconazole-similar toketoconazolebutwith fewer side effects;probablymore
mg/kg PO q12h
Comments
·Dermatophyte culture is the only means of truly monitoring response to ther-
apy;many animalswilllinicallyimprove,butreman culturepositive
·Repeatfungal cultures toward theend of the treatment regimen and continue
treatment until at least one culture result is negative.
In resistant cases,theculturemayberepeated weekly,using the toothbrush th
nique; continue treatment until 2-3 consecutive culture results are negative.
·Initiate a quarantineperiod and obtain dermatophyte cultures of all animals
entering the household to preventreinfection from other animals.
·Consider the possibility of rodents aiding in the spread of the disease.
·Avoid infective soil,if a geophilic dermatophyte is involved.
·Consider usinggriseofulvin for10-14 days as a prophylactic treatment of ex-
posed animals.
·Many animals will "self-clear”a dermatophyte infection over a period of a
few months.
·Treatment for the disease hastens clinical cure and helps reduce environmen-
talcontamination.
·Some infections,particularly in long-haired cats ormultianimal situations,
can be very persistent.
Client Education
·Inform owner that many short-haired cats in a single-cat environment and
·Advise that treatment can be both frustrating and expensive, especially in
multianimal households or recurrent cases.
·Informownerthatenvironmental treatment,includingfomites,ismportant,s-
pecially in recurrent cases;dilute bleach(1:10)is a practicaland relatively effec-
tive means of providing environmental decontamination;concentrated bleach
and formalin (1%) are more effective at killing spores, but their use is not as
practical in many situations; chlorhexidine was ineffective in pilot studies.
Inform owner that in a multianimal environment or cattery situation,treat
ment and control canbevery complicated;referral to a veterinarian with ex-
pertise in this type of situation should be considered.

generalized
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Caused by thevirtuallyubiquitous dimorphicfungusSporothrix schenckii,
which typically infects via direct inoculation;direct inoculation not are-
quirement
Signalment/History
Cats,dogs,and humans
·Dogs-more commonly seen in hunting dogs because of the increased likeli-
hoodofpuncturewoundsassociatedwiththornsor splinters
·Cats-intactmalecats thatroam outdoors andfightbecauseof theincreased
likelihoodofpuncturewounds and acquiring the disease from their oppo-
nents
·Animals exposed to soil rich in decayingorganic debris appear tobe predis
posed.
Puncture wounds associatedwithforeign bodies provideanincreased oppor-
tunity for infection in dogs;cat scratches provide a similar opportunity in
roamingcats.

Sporotrichosis
327
·Cytology of the exudate and staining-cats: often the only test necessary to
confirm infection; cigar-to round-shapedyeastmay befound intracellularly
or free in the exudate; dogs: special fungal stains (PAS or GMS) may aid in
the diagnosis; a negative finding does not rule out the disease
·Cultures of the deeply affected tissueoften require surgery to obtain an ad-
equate sample; alert thelaboratory that sporotrichosis is a differential diag-
nosis;secondary bacterialinfections common
Therapeutics
·Remember the zoonotic potential when treating patients.
·Sometimes outpatient treatment may be considered.
SSKI-SUPERSATURATED POTASSIUM IODIDE
·Treatmentof choice-dogs:40mg/kgPOq8h withfood;cats:20 mg/kgPO
q12h with food
·Continue for 30 days after resolution of the clinical lesions.
·Dogs-if signs of iodism are noted (dry hair coat,excessive scales,nasal or
ocular discharge,vomiting,depression,or collapse),discontinue for1week;
mild symptoms,reinitiate at the same dose; severe or recurrent symptoms,
consider other drugs
Catssigns of iodism（depression,vomiting,anorexia,twitching,hypother
mia,and cardiovascular collapse）are more common;if noted,discontinue;
use other drugs
KETOCONAZOLE AND ITRACONAZOLE
●Shown encouraging results for fungal diseases in cats and dogs
·Dogs-ketoconazole:15mg/kgPOq12h,preferably with an acidicmeal
(e.g,tomato juice),until 1 month after clinicalresolution;resolution should
occur within approximately 3months; side effects relatively mild,anorexia
most common;acute hepatopathy,pruritus,alopecia,and lightening of the
hair color reported
·Cats-—ketoconazole:5-10mg/kgPOq12-24h,or itraconazole10mg/kg/day
preferably with an acidic meal until 1 month after clinical resolution; side ef-
fects include gastrointestinal disturbances,depression,fever,jaundice,and
neurologic signs;may be necessary to alternate drugs
Comments
·Re-evaluate every 2 to 4weeks for clinical signs and side effects associated
with treatment.
·Although difficult,try to determine thesource of the original infection to pre-
vent repeat infections.
·Unresponsive to therapy—not unexpected; consider alternative treatment or
combined treatment regimens (SSKl and ketoconazole);itraconazole rela-
tively untested but promising
·Zoonotic; proper precautions and client education are of paramount impor
tance

Differential Diagnosis
DOGS
·Other causes of focal or diffuse neurologic diseasedistemper;bacterial
meningoencephalitis; brain tumors; rickettsial diseases; granulomatous
meningoencephalomyelitis;otherfungal diseases
·Nasal lesions,especially at the mucocutaneous junctionconsidered im-
mune-mediated
·Lymphosarcomapossible cause of the lymphadenopathy
With chorioretinitis and opticneuritis-consider other fungal infections,dis
temper,and neoplasia
CATS
●Nasal lesions-similar to nasal tumors,chronic rhinitis,and chronic sinusitis
Ulcerative skin changesmay be the result of bacterial infection,fights,or tu-
mor (especially squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal planum)
·Ocular and brain signsmay be attributed to lymphosarcoma,FIV, and tox-
oplasmosis
Diagnostics
·Mild anemia in some cats
·Eosinophilia occasionally seen
·Chemistries usually normal
·Latex agglutination or ELISA—detect cryptococcal capsular antigen in
serum;few false-positive tests;most infected animals have measurable capsu-
lar antigentiters;magnitude of titercorrelateswith extent of infection
·Lateral radiographs of the nasopharynx—cryptococcal granuloma behind
the soft palate
·Nasal radiographs (cats)soft tissue-density material filling the nasal pas
sage; occasional bone destruction of the nasal dorsum
●Thoracic radiographsnot indicated,unless signs of lower respiratory tract
disease
·Dogs with neurologic disease-additional procedures: cytologic examina-
tion,culture of CSF,and measurement of CSF capsular antigen often make
the diagnosis
·Definitive diagnosis-aspirates of the mucoid material in the nasal passages
orbiopsy of thegranulomatous tissue that protrudesfrom the nares
granuloma in the nasopharynx;identify by pulling the soft palate forward
with a spay hook to expose the mass
·Biopsy-skin lesions of the head;aspirates of involved lymph nodes;usually
identifies organisms
·Cultures-confirm the diagnosis;determine drug susceptibility

The 5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
Gross lesions-gray,gelatinous mass produced by the polysaccharide cap-
sule; usually found in the nose,sinuses,and nasopharynx of cats
·Neurologic lesionsusually seen in dogs; diffuse or fungal granulomas pro-
ducing a mass in thebrain
·Chorioretinitis with or without retinal detachment or optic neuritisdogs
and cats
·Histologicresponseusuallypyogranulomatous;inflammatory cellinfiltrate
may be mild because the polysaccharide capsule interferes with neutrophil
migration
Therapeutics
·Neurologic signsmay require inpatient supportive care until stable
·Catsnasal obstruction influences appetite; encourage patients to eat by of-
fering palatable food
·Patients treated with itraconazole—give medication in fatty food (e.g,
cannedfood)toimprove absorption
·Surgical removal of granulomatous masses in the nasopharynx to reduce res-
piratory difficulties
DRUGS OF CHOICE
Triazole antifungal agents-expensive;itraconazole somewhat economical
·Fluconazole—preferred for ocular or CNS involvement because it iswater-
soluble and penetrates thenervous system better;cats,50mg POq12h;dogs,
5 mg/kgPO q12h
·Itraconazolegive with a fatty meal to maximize absorption; cats,10-15
mg/kgPO daily; dogs,5mg/kg PO q12h;pellets in the capsule can be mixed
with food;no apparent adverse taste
·Flucytosine-100mg/kgPO dividedinto3-4 doses per day;in addition to tri-
azole;helpful when the infection does notrespond well
CONTRAINDICATIONS
·Avoid steroids
PRECAUTIONS
·Triazoles-hepatic toxicity; anorexia signals problems; monitor liver en-
zymesmonthly
·Itraconazole-ulcerative dermatitis (differentiate from the skin lesions of
cryptococcosis);new skin lesions after the disease is much improved should
be considered a drug reaction
Flucytosine-drug eruptions manifested as depigmentation of lips and nose,
ulceration,exudation,and crusting of the skin;bonemarrow suppression
POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS
·Itraconazoledo not give with the antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole
or with cisapride
ALTERNATIVEDRUGS
·Amphotericin B (intravenous)and flucytosine-dogs and cats that do not re
spond to a triazole;monitor BUN closely to avoid permanent renal damage

Comments
·Inform client that this is a chronic disease that requires months of treatment.
·Reassure client that the infection is not zoonotic.
·Monitor liver enzymesmonthly in patients receiving a triazole antifungal agent.
·Improvement in clinical signs,resolution oflesions,improvement in well-be
ing,and return of appetitemeasure the response to treatment.
·Capsular antigen titers-determine response to and duration of treatment; af-
ter2months oftreatment,the titersshoulddecreasesubstantially ifeffective
if ineffective,try the other triazole,because organism can become resistant
·The organism is ubiquitous and cannot be avoided.
·Patients with neurologic disease mayhave seizures and permanent neurologic
changes.
·Treatment-anticipated duration 3months to 1 year;patients with CNS dis-
easerequire lifelong maintenance
· Cats concurrently infected with FeLV or FIV—may have a worse prognosis
●Capsular antigen titersmeasure every 2months until 6months after com-
pletion of treatment; continue treatment for 2months after antigen is nonde-
tectable,ifpossible;ifpatientmaintainslowtitersformonths after allsigns
of disease have resolved,continue treatment for at least 3months after re-
duction in antigenlevels andresolution of clinical signs;if titers then rise sig
nificantly,resume therapy
·Not considered zoonotic,but possibility of transmission through bite wounds
·Inform client that the organism was acquired from the environment and that
he or she couldbeatincreasedrisk,especially ifimmunosuppressed.

COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS:
SYSTEMICMYCOSIS
Nita Kay Gulbas
Definition/Overview
A systemic mycosis caused by the inhalation of infective arthroconidia of the soil-
bornefungus Coccidioidesimmitis
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Inhalation of infective arthroconidia is the primary route of infection.Fever,
lethargy,inappetence,coughing,and joint panor stiffnessmaybenoticed
Disseminationmay occurwithin 10 days of exposure,resulting in signs re-
lated to the organ system involved.Asymptomaticinfectionsmay occur,and
most animals developimmunity without onset of clinical signs.Themajority
of animalsbecomesolidlyimmuneafter initial infection.
Skin lesions are usually associated with dissemination,but penetrating
wounds haverarely been associatedwith skinlesions.
Fewer than10 inhaled arthrospores are sufficient tocause disease in suscep-
tible animals.“Susceptible”refers to the animals in which extrapulmonary
dissemination occurs.Signs of disseminationmaynotbeevident for several
monthsafter theinitialinfection.
·Respiratory-the site of initial infection
Extrapulmonary spreadmay occur tolongbonesand joints,eyes,skin,liver
kidneys,CNS,cardiovascular system（pericardium and myocardium),and
testes.
Coccidioides immitisgrows several inches deepin the soil,where it survives
high ambient temperatures and low moisture.Aftera periodof rainfall,the
334
Coccidioidomycosis
335
organism returns to the soil surface where it sporulates,releasing many
arthroconidia that are disseminated by wind and dust storms.
·Aggressive nosing about in soil and underbrush may expose susceptible ani-
mals to large doses of the fungus in contaminated soil.
·Dust storms after the rainy season;increased incidences are noted after earth
quakes
·Land development where much earth disruption occurs may lead to increased
exposure.
Signalment/History
·An uncommon disease,even in endemic areas.It occurs more commonly in
dogs,and rarely in cats.
Coccidioidesimmitisis found in the southwestern UnitedStatesin the geographic
LowerSonoranlifezone.tismorecommoninsouthernCaliforniaArizona,and
southwest Texas and is less prevalent inNewMexico,Nevada,and Utah.
·Most patients are young animals< 4 years of age.
HISTORICALFINDINGS
·Anorexia
Coughing
·Fever unresponsive to antibiotics
·Lameness
●Weakness, paraparesis, back and neck pain
·Seizures

Clinical Features
DoGS
·Coughing
·Dyspnea
·Fever
SIGNS WITH DISSEMINATED DISEASE
·Bone swelling,joint enlargement and lameness
·Cachexia
·Lethargy
·Lymphadenomegaly
·Neurologic dysfunction caused by dissemination to both the central and pe-
ripheral CNS
·Skin ulcers and draining tracts
·Uveitis,keratitis
CATS
·Cachexia
·Draining skin lesions
336
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinical Companion
·Dyspnea
·Lameness caused by bone involvement
·Uveitis
Differential Diagnosis
·Pulmonary lesions may resemble those ofother systemicmycoses(e.g.,histo-
plasmosis,blastomycosis).
Lymphadenomegalymaybe seen in lymphosarcoma,other systemic mycoses,
and localizedbacterialinfections.
·Bone lesions may resemble those caused by primary or metastatic bone tu-
morsorbacterialosteomyelitis.
·Skin lesions must be differentiated from routine abscesses or other bacterial
disease processes.
Diagnostics
·Hemogrammild nonregenerative anemia,neutrophilicleukocytosis,mono-
cytosis
·Serum chemistry profilehyperglobulinemia,hypoalbuminemia,azotemia
with renalinvolvement
·Urinalysis-low urine specific gravity and proteinuria with inflammatory
glomerulonephritis
·Serologic tests for antibody to C.immitis by a laboratory proficient in han-
ding the testsmay provide a presumptive diagnosis and aid in monitoringre-
sponse to therapy.
·Radiography of lung (interstitial infiltrates)and bone (osteolysis) lesions may
aid in diagnosis.
·Microscopicidentification of thelargespherule form of C.immitisinlesion
or biopsy material is the definitive method of diagnosis.Lymph node aspi-
rates andimpression smears of skinlesions or draining exudatemay,in some
patients,yield organisms.
·Caution should be used if culturing draining lesions suspected of being in-
fected with C.immitis,as the mycelial form is highly contagious.
Biopsy of infected tissue oftenis preferred toavoid false-negativeresults.Tis-
sues involved,however,are not readily accessible and serologic testing is a
more logical approach.
PATHOLOGICFINDINGS
●Granulomatous, suppurative or pyogranulomatous inflammation present in
many tissues.
·Presence of the characteristic spherule forms in affected tissues.In some pa-
tients, the numbers of spherules present may be small.
Therapeutics
·Generally treated as outpatients.Patients treated with amphotericin B,how-
ever,will require hospitalization several times a week during their treatment
Coccidioidomycosis
337
period.Concurrent clinical symptoms(e.g.,seizures,pain,coughing） should
be treatedappropriately.
·Restrict activity until clinical signs begin to subside.
·Feed a high-quality palatable diet to maintain body weight.
·The necessity and expense of long-term therapy of a serious illness with the
possibility of treatment failure should be reviewed.In addition, the client
should bemade aware of the possible side effects of the drugs used.
·In cases of focal granulomatous organ involvement (e.g. consolidated pul-
monarylunglobe,eye,kidney)surgical removalof the affected organmay be
indicated.
DRUGS OF CHOICE
Coccidioidomycosis is considered the most severe and life-threatening of the sys-
temic mycoses.Treatment of disseminated disease requires at least 1 year of ag-
gressive antifungal therapy.
Dogs
·Several oral medications in the azole family of drugs are currently available
for the treatment of coccidioidomycoses.
·Ketoconazole (KTZ) is dosed at 5-10 mg/kg PO q12h.The medication may
be givenwith food,and there is somebelief that co-administration of high
doses of vitamin C may improve the absorption of the drug.Treatment
should be continued for 1 year.
·Itraconazole (ITZ)is dosed at5mg/kgPO q12h.The drug is administered
similarly asKTZ.It has been reported to have a higher penetration rate than
ketoconazole,but a better clinical response has not been observed.
·Fluconazole(FCZ) is dosed at 5 mg/kg PO q12h and has been noted to greatly
increase the success of treatment,especially inneurologicinfections.The drugis
extremelyexpensive,andtheclient shouldbeprepared for theexpense.Afterex-
tended use,thefrequency of dosing in some casesmaybe lowered to once a day.
·Amphotericin B(AMB)is less commonly recommended because of the high
risk of renal damagewithamphotericinBandthe availability ofeffective oral
medications.Amphotericin B can be administered at a dosage of O.5 mg/kg
IV3 times aweek,for a total cumulative dosage of 8-10mg/kg.It isgiven IV
either as a slow infusion (in dogs that are gravely ill) or as a rapid bolus (in
fairly healthy dogs).For slowinfusion,addAMBto250-500mLof5%dex
trose solution and administer as a drip over a period of 4-6hours.For a rapid
bolus,addAMBto30mLof5%dextrose solution andadminister overape-
riod of 5minutes through abutterfly catheter.Tolessen the adverse renal ef-
fects of AMB,give 0.9%NaCl (2mL/kg/hr) for several hours before initiat-
ing AMB therapy.
·A combinationof AMB and KTZmay be used in dogs that have not re-
sponded to either drug alone or have exhibited significant toxicity.It is not
clear thatcombinationtherapyis anymore effective thansingledrugtherapy
in the treatment of coccidioidomycoses.For combination chemotherapy,ad-
minister AMB as described to a totalcumulative dosage of4-6mg/kg,to-
gether withKTZ at 10 mg/kg PO divided daily for at least 8-12 months.
Cats
·Any of the following azoles may beused in cats:
Ketoconazole 50 mg total dose PO q12h
338
The5-MinuteVeterinary ConsultClinical Companion
Itraconazole 25-50mg total dosePO q12h
Fluconazole25-50mgtotaldosePOq12h
·Alternatively,AMB can be administered by rapidIVbolus ata dosage of0.25
mg/kg,3 times aweek,for a total cumulative dosage of 4mg/kg.This can
then be followed by long-termKTZ therapy, depending on the clinical re-
sponse.
CONTRAINDICATIONS/PRECAUTIONS
·Drugs metabolized primarilyby theliver should not be administered along
withketoconazole.
·Drugsmetabolized primarily by the kidneys should notbe administered along
withAMB.
Side effects of azoles include inappetence,vomiting,and hepatotoxicity.The
drugs may be stopped until signs abate,and restarted at a lower dose that
maybeslowlyincreased to therecommendeddoseif the animalisabletotol-
erate the drug.Thenewerazoles(ITZandFCZ)have fewer side effects.
·Side effects of AMB therapy can be severe and include renal dysfunction,
fever,inappetence,vomiting,and phlebitis.
Comments
PATIENT MONITORING
·Serologic titers should be monitored every 2-3months.Animals should be
treated until their titersfalltoless than 1:2.Animals displaying poorresponse
to therapy should have a 2-4 hour post pill drug level measured to assure ad-
equate absorption of the drug.
·BUNandurinalysis shouldbemonitoredinallanimalstreatedwithAMB.
Treatment should be temporarily discontinued if the BUN rises above 50
mg/dL orgranular casts are noted in theurine.
PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE
·No vaccine is available for dogs or cats.
·Contaminated soil in endemic areas should be avoided,particularly during
dust storms after the rainy season.
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
·Pulmonary disease resulting in severe coughing may temporarily worsen af-
term oral prednisone and cough suppressants maybe required to alleviate the
respiratory signs.
·Hepatotoxicity may result fromKTZ therapy.
·Nephrotoxicity may result from AMB therapy.
EXPECTED COURSEAND PROGNOSIS
·The prognosis is guarded to grave.Many dogs will improve following oral
therapy;however,relapsesmaybe seen,speciallyif therapyis shortend.
The overall recoveryrate has been estimated at 60%,but some report a 90%
response to fluconazole therapy.
·The prognosis for cats is not well documented,but rapid dissemination re-
quiringlong-term therapy shouldbe anticipated.
Coccidioidomycosis
339
·Serologic testing every 34 months after completion of therapy is recom-
mended to monitor the possibility of relapse.
Spontaneous recovery from disseminated coccidioidomycosis without treat-
mentis extremelyrare.
ZOONOTICPOTENTIAL
The spherule form of the fungusas found in animal tissues,isnot directly trans-
missible to people or other animals.Under certain rare circumstances,however,
there could be reversion to growth of the infective mold form of the fungus on or
within bandages placed over a draining lesion or in contaminated bedding.Drain-
inglesions canlead to contamination oftheenvironmentwith arthrospores.Care
should be exercisedwheneverhandling aninfected draininglesion.Specialprecau
tions should berecommended to householdswhere the owners may be immuno-
suppressed.
PREGNANCY
·KTZshouldbe usedinpregnant animals only if the potential benefit justifies
the potential risk to offspring.
·Teratogenic effects of AMB have not been identified.

RADIOGRAPHS
·Lungsessential for diagnosis and prognosis
·Generalized interstitial to nodularinfiltrate
·Tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy-common
·Changes-inconsistent with bacterial pneumonia;may resemble metastatic
tumors,especially hemangiosarcoma
·Focal bone lesions-lytic and proliferative;can be mistaken for osteosarcoma
CYTOLOGY/HISTOPATHOLOGY
Cytologyoflymphode aspirates,trachealwashfluidorimpression smears
of draining skin lesions-best method for diagnosis
·Histopathology of bone biopsies or enucleated blind eyes-identify the organism
·Organisms-usually plentiful in the tissues;may be scarce in tracheal washes
if thereisnoproductivecough
PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS
·Lesionspyogranulomatous with many thick-walled,budding yeasts; occa-
sionallyvery fibrous with few organisms found
·Lungs with large amounts of inflammatory infiltrate do not collapse when the
chest is opened.
·Specialfungal stains-facilitatefindingthe organisms
Therapeutics
·Severely dyspneic dogs-require an oxygen cage for a minimum of 1 week be-
fore lungimprovement is sufficient forcomfort inroom air;manyhavewors-
ening of lung disease during the first few days of treatment, owing to an in-
crease in the inflammatory response after theBlastomyces organisms die and
release their contents.
·Patients with respiratory compromise must be restricted.
·Removal of an abscessed lung lobe may be required when medical treatment
cannotresolve theinfection.
DRUGS OF CHOICE
Itraconazole
·Dogs-5 mg/kg PO q12h with a fat-rich meal, such as canned dog food,for
the first 3 days to achieve a therapeutic blood concentration as soon as pos-
sible; then reduce to one a day
·Cats—5 mg/kg PO q12h; open the 100-mg capsules containing pellets and
mix with palatable food
·Treat for a minimum of 60 days or for 1 month after all signs of disease have
disappeared.
ALTERNATIVE DRUGS
·Amphotericin B--O.5 mg/kg IV every other day in dogs that cannot take oral
medication or that do not respond to itraconazole(see Histoplasmosis);use the
lipidcomplexfor dogswith renal dysfunction that cannot take itraconazole
·Ketoconazole—10 mg/kgPOq12h;cheaper alternative toitraconazole;
lowerresponserate and higherrecurrencerate
344
The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
CONTRAINDICATIONS/PRECAUTIONS
·Corticosteroids-usually contraindicated because the anti-inflammatory ef-
fects allow uninhibited proliferation of the organisms; patients with previous
steroid therapy require a longer duration of treatment;for dogs with life-
threatening dyspnea,dexamethasone(0.2mg/kg daily)may belifesaving
when given in conjunction with itraconazole treatment; discontinue steroids
as soon as possible
ItraconazoleToxicity
·Anorexiamost common sign; attributed to liver toxicity;monitor serum
ALTmonthly for duration of treatment or when anorexia occurs;temporar-
ily discontinue drug for patients with anorexia and ALT activities>200; af-
ter appetite improves,restart at half the previously used dose
Ulcerative dermatitis-seen in some dogs;the result of vasculitis; dose-related
condition;temporarilydiscontinue drug;when ulcers haveresolved,restart at
half the previously used dose
·For humans,itraconazole is contraindicated with terfenadine and cisapride.
Comments
·Serum chemistry—monthly to monitor for hepatic toxicity or if anorexia de-
velops
·No teratogenic effects of itraconazole at therapeutic doses in rats and mice;
embryotoxicity found at high doses;no dog orcat studies; one dog started on
itraconazole halfway through her pregnancy delivereda normal litter.
THORACICRADIOGRAPHS
·Determine duration of treatment.
·Considerable permanent changes in the lungs after the infection hasresolved
may occur,making determination of persistent active disease difficult.
·At 60 days of treatment—if active lung disease is seen, continue treatment for
30 days
·At 90 days of treatmentif the same as day 60,changes are residual effects
of inactive disease;if better than day 60,continue treatment for 30 days;if
worse than day 60,continue treatment for30daysmore,thenre-radiograph
·At 120 days of treatmentre-radiograph.If worse,continue treatment for
further 30 days and then re-radiograph. If inactive disease, continue treat-
ment for 30 more days and then stop.
PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE
·Location of environmental growth of Blastomyces organisms unknown;thus
difficulttoavoidexposurerestricting exposure tolakesandstreamscould be
done but is not verypractical.
·Dogs that recover from the infection are probably immune to reinfection.
EXPECTEDCOURSEANDPROGNOSIS
·Death-25%of dogs die during the first week of treatment; early diagnosis
improves chance of survival.
·Severity of lung involvement and invasion into the brain affect prognosis.
Blastomycosis:SystemicMycosis
345
·Recurrence—about 20% of dogs;usually within 3-6months after comple-
tion of treatment, even with 60-90 days of treatment；may occur up to 15
months after treatment; a second course of itraconazole treatment will cure
most patients;drugresistance toitraconazole has not been observed
ZOONOTICPOTENTIAL
·Not spread from animals topeople,except through bite wounds;inoculation
of organisms from dogbites has occurred.
·Avoid cuts during necropsy of infected dogs and avoid needle sticks when as
piratinglesions.
·Warn clients thatblastomycosis is acquired from an environmental source
and that they may have been exposed at the same time as the patient； com-
mon source exposure hasbeen documented in duck and coon hunters; the in-
cidence in dogs is 10 times that in humans.
·Encourage clients with respiratory and skin lesions to inform their physicians
that theymayhavebeen exposed toblastomycosis

Therapeutics
·Emaciated, chronically infected animals—consider euthanasia; prognosis
verypoor
·Diethigh-quality protein; special for renal insufficiency, if necessary
Cats-single dermal nodulelesions are best surgically removed
Advise client of potential zoonotic transmission of organisms in lesions tohu-
mans.
Inform client that organisms will never be eliminated,and relapse,requiring
treatment, is inevitable.
DRUGS
·Sodium stibogluconate--available from the Centers forDisease Control and
Prevention;30-50mg/kg IVor SCq24h for3-4weeks
Meglumine antimonate—100 mg/kg IVor SCq24h for3-4weeks
·Allopurinolvery efficacious in treating one dog:7mg/kgPOq8h for 3
months
-interferon given with antimonials-good success inhumans
CONTRAINDICATIONS/PRECAUTIONS
·Seriously ill dogs-start antimonial drugs at lower doses
·Renal insufficiencytreat before giving antimonial drugs;prognosis depends
onrenal function at the onset of treatment
Comments
·Treatment efficacy-monitor by clinical improvement and identification of
organismsin repeatbiopsies
months after completion of treatment
·Prognosis for a cure--very guarded; antimonial therapy gives dogs some
quality of life

Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Rapidcytolysis of infected cellswith resultingtissue pathology and clinical
disease
·A small,nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus;numerous strains exist in
nature,with varying degrees of antigenic cross-reactivity;more than one
serotype;relatively stable and resistant to many disinfectants.
Respiratory-rhinitis;interstitial pneumonia;ulceration of the tip of the nose
·Ophthalmicacute serous conjunctivitiswithout keratitis or corneal ulcers

Diagnostics
·Serologic testing on paired serum samples-detect a rise in neutralizing anti-
body titers against thevirus
·Radiographs of thelungsa consolidation of lung tissue in cats with pneu-
monia
·Cell cultures to isolating the virus-oral pharynx;lung tissue;feces;blood; se-
cretions from the nose and conjunctiva
·Immunofluorescent assays of lung tissue-viral antigen
PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS
·Grossupper respiratory infection; ocular and nasal discharge;pneumonia
with consolidation of large portions of individuallung lobes;possibleulcer-
ations on the tongue,lips,and hard palate
·Histopathologicinterstitialpneumonia of large portionsofindividuallung
lobes;ulcerations on epithelium of the tongue,lips,andhard palate;mild in-
flammatory reactions in the nose and conjunctiva
Therapeutics
·Outpatient,unless severe pneumonia occurs
·Clean eyes and nose as indicated.
·Provide soft foods.
·Oxygenwith severe pneumonia
·Patients should be restricted from contact with other cats to prevent trans-
mission of the disease.
·Soft foods--if ulcerations restrict eating
·Discuss the need for proper vaccination and the need to modify the vaccina-
tion protocol inbreeding catteries to include kittensbefore they become in-
fected (often at 6-8 weeks of age) from a carrier queen.
·No specific antiviral drugs that are effective
·Broad-spectrum antibioticsusually indicated (e.g., amoxicilin at 22mg/kg
POq12h)
·Secondary bacterial infections of affected cats are not nearly as important as
with FHV-1 infections.
·Antibiotic eye ointmentsto reduce secondary bacterial infections of the
conjunctiva
·Appropriate painmedication-for transient arthritispain
Comments
PATIENT MONITORING
·Monitor for sudden development of dyspnea associatedwithpneumonia.
·No specificlaboratory tests
PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE
·All cats should be vaccinated at the same time they are vaccinated against
FHV-1;routine vaccination with either MLV or inactivated vaccines should
be done at 8-10 weeks of age and repeated 3-4 weeks later.
Feline Calicivirus
353
·Breeding catteries-respiratory disease is aproblem;vaccinatekittens at an
earlier age,eitherwith an additionalvaccination at4-5weeks of age orwith
intranasaladministration at 10-14 days of age;follow-up vaccinations at 6,
10, and 14 weeks of age
·Annual vaccines recommended;immunity undoubtedlylasts>1year
·American Association of Feline Practitionersclassifies FHV,FPV,and cali-
civirus as core vaccines;recommends vaccination of all cats with these three
agentsonthenitialvisit,after12weksofage,and1yearlater;boostersr
calicivirusshouldbegiven every3years
·Vaccination will not eliminate infection in a subsequent exposure but will
prevent clinical disease caused by most strains.
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
·Interstitial pneumonia—most serious complication;canbe life-threatening
·Secondarybacterial infections of the lungs or upper airways
·Oral ulcers and the acute arthritis usually heal without complications.
EXPECTED COURSEANDPROGNOSIS
·Clinical disease-usually appears 3-4 days after exposure
Once neutralizing antibodies appear,about7days after exposure,recovery is
usually rapid.
·Prognosis excellent, unless severe pneumonia develops
·Recovered cats—-persistently infected for long periods;willcontinuously shed
small quantities ofvirusin oral secretions
·Affected cats mayalso be concurrently infected with FHV-1, especially in
multicatandbreedingfacilities.

SuzetteM.LeClercandEdwardG.Clark
Overview/Definition
·Papillomaviruses(PVs)-group of nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA
viruses that induce proliferative cutaneous tumors in cats and dogs andmu-
cosal tumors in dogs;eachishost and fairly site-specific,with characteristic
clinicalandmicroscopicchangesininfected tissues
·Tumors-papillomas,warts,or verrucae; generally benign; spontaneously
regress;rarelymay undergo conversion toSCC
Lesions-oftenmultiple,well demarcated,and exophytic;sometimes hyper-
keratotic plaques or with papules;may be deeply pigmented (black or
brown),pink,tan,orwhite
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Infection-inoculation through breaks in the epidermis or mucosal epithe-
lium;iatrogenic transmission through use of contaminated instruments pos
sible
Signalment/History

Endocrine
Dermatoses
The 5-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion
366
·Accessory thyroid tissue in the neck or thoracic cavity usually undergoes hy
perplasia and produces physiologic amounts of thyroid hormones.
·Acquired secondary hypothyroidism is very uncommon in dogs and cats; it is
caused by pituitary dysfunction or destruction,leading to decreased thy-
rotropin(thyroid-stimulatinghormone,TSH)production.
·Thyrotropin is the pituitary hormone responsible for stimulating thyroid hor
mone synthesisand secretion.
·Increased circulating levels of glucocorticoids (endogenous or exogenous) can
leads to decreased blood levels of Ta and free T4.
·Thyrotrope secretion of TsH normalizes when blood glucocorticosteroid lev-
els return to normal.
·Tertiary hypothyroidism caused by decreased thyrotropin-releasing hormone
(TRH)production by thehypothalamus has not been documented in dogs or
cats.
CONGENITALHYPOTHYROIDISM
·Congenital hypothyroidism is very rare in both dogs and cats.
·Reported causes of primary congenital hypothyroidism in dogs and cats in-
clude thyroid agenesis or dysgenesis, dyshormonogenesis,and iodine defi-
ciency.
·Secondary congenital hypothyroidism ismost commonly observed in German
shepherd dogs with a panhypopituitarism caused by a cystic Rathke's pouch.
·A congenital deficiency in pituitary TSH production was reported in a family
of giant schnauzers.
SYSTEMS AFFECTED
·Endocrine/metabolic
·Skin/exocrine
·Behavioral
·Neuromuscular
·Reproductive
·Gastrointestinal
·Ophthalmic
-Cardiovascular
Nervous
Signalment/History
No known genetic basis for the inheritance of primary hypothyroidism in ca-
nines.
·Familial lymphocytic thyroiditishas been reported in individual colonies of
borzois,beagles,and GreatDanes.
·Primary hypothyroidism is the most common endocrinopathy of dogs;the re-
ported prevalence of hypothyroidism in dogs is 1:156-1:500.
·Hypothyroidism is rare in cats.
·Primary acquired hypothyroidism is more common in medium to large-sized
dogs.
Hypothyroidism

·Breedsreported tobe predisposed to developingprimary acquired hypothy-
roidism include thegoldenretriever,Doberman pinscher,Irish setter,Great
Dane,Airedale terrier,Old English sheepdog,dachshund,miniature
schnauzer,cockerspaniel,poodle,andboxr.
·Most common in middle-aged dogs(4-10years)
No definitive sex predilection has been identified;however,castrated male
dogs andspayed female dogsappear tobeatincreasedrisk.
Neuteringmay slightly increaserisk of developing primary hypothyroidism.
·Bilateral thyroidectomymay resultinhypothyroidism.
HISTORICALFINDINGS
Most common—lethargy,inactivity,mental dullness,weightgain,hairloss
or excessive shedding,lack of hair regrowth following clipping,dry orlus-
terless haircoat,excessive scaling,hyperpigmentation,recurrent skin infec-
tions,andcold intolerance
·Uncommongeneralized weakness,incoordination,head tilt,facial paraly
sis,seizures,and infertility

Clinical Features
DERMATOLOGIC
·Bilaterally symmetric truncalalopecia that spares thehead andextremities-
common
·Alopecia isusuallynonpruriticunlessa secondarypyoderma or otherpruritic

·Earlyin the disease course,alopecia may be multifocal and asymmetric;
alopecic lesion may have irregular margins.
·Hyperpigmentation and increased thickness ofthe epidermis are common,
particularly in friction areas.(Fig.58-2)
Seborrhea-common;can be generalized,multifocal,or localized
A secondary superficial pyoderma occurs frequently;deep pyoderma is less
common.
·Dermal accumulation ofmucopolysaccharidescanlead tononpittingedema
(myxedema),particularly in the facialarea;this produces the classic“tragic”
expression associatedwith hypothyroidism.
METABOLIC

poreflexia,headtilt,facialparalysis/paresisand ataxia.
Hypothyroidism
369
·A secondary myopathy characterized by denervation atrophy is usually pre
sent in dogswithhypothyroidpolyneuropathy.
·Some hypothyroid dogs develop a generalized myopathy without concurrent
neurologic involvement; these dogs present for generalized weakness.
·Seizures secondary to marked cerebral atherosclerosis have been rarely re
ported in hypothyroid dogs with marked hyperlipidemia.
·Laryngeal paralysis,megaesophagus,and Horner's syndrome have been as-
sociatedwithhypothyroidism,butdefinitive proof of a causal relationshipis
lacking.
OPHTHALMIC
·Corneal lipid deposits
·Lipemia retinalis
Felines-Rare
·Unkempt appearance, matting of hair, nonpruritic seborrhea sicca, pinnal
alopecia
·Lethargy

·Disproportionate dwarfism (large,broad head with short neck and limbs),
shortened mandible,protruding tongue,delayeddentaleruption
·Constipation/obstipation-particularly in cats
·Hypothermia
·Retention of puppy coat, progressive truncal alopecia (dogs)
Differential Diagnosis
·Dermatologic abnormalities are frequently the predominant clinical abnor-
mality in dogs with hypothyroidism.
Consider endocrine causes of alopecia (e.g.,hyperadrenocorticism, sex hor
mone-relateddermatopathies,growthhormone-responsive dermatosisand
adrenal sex hormone abnormalities).
·If fasting hyperlipidemia (the most common laboratory abnormality in hy
pothyroid dogs）must rule out diabetes mellitus,hyperadrenocorticism,
nephrotisyromeuteanreatitisbiliarybstrutinandrmayl
metabolism abnormalities.
Diagnostics
·Hypercholesterolemia-observed in up to 80%of hypothyroid dogs
·Hypertriglyceridemia and gross lipemia-less common
·Mild,normochromic,normocytic,nonregenerative anemia—up to 50% of
hypothyroid dogs
·Mildly elevated serum creatine kinase levels are intermittently identified.
·Do endocrine testing in dogs with clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities
suggesting hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism
371
·Inhypothyroid dogs,the Ta concentration following TSH administration
doesnotriseinto thenormalreferencerange and frequently doesnot exceed
the pre-TSH stimulationT4 concentration.
·T4 levels increase beyond the upper limit of the normal reference range fol-
lowingTSH stimulation of healthy,euthyroid dogs.
·Dogs with moderate or severe nonthyroidal illness, early primary hypothy
roidism,orearly secondary or tertiaryhypothyroidismmay show amuted re-
sponse to TSH administration.
·T4 concentrations increase but frequently not above the normalreference
range.
·Reevaluate these animals in3-4months or following resolution of theirnonthy.
roidal disease,if they still have clinical signs compatible with hypothyroidism.
Because of thedifficulty and expenseofobtainingTSHTSH stimulationtest-
ing is not commonly done in private practice; similar diagnostic information
can be obtained by evaluatingbaseline serumT4,FT4,and endogenous TSH
concentrations.
TRH STIMULATION TESTING
·Exogenous TRH is administered IV;pre-and poststimulationT4 or TSH con
centrations are measured.
·In euthyroid dogs,both T4 and TSH concentrations increase above baseline
values.
·In hypothyroid dogs,Tconcentration does not increase significantly over the
baseline T4 value.
·Changes in Tconcentration inhealthy,euthyroid dogs are smalland vari-
able,makingit difficult todifferentiatenormal dogs from hypothyroid dogs.
·Thyrotropin levels also increase in dogs with primary hypothyroidism,but
thepercentage increase over baseline concentrations isless than in euthyroid
dogs.
·TRH stimulation testing isnot recommended for diagnosing hypothyroidism;
better tests are available;evaluatingTSH concentrations followingTRH admin
istration candifferentiate primaryhypothyroidismfromcentral hypothyroidism.
RADIOGRAPHY
·Epiphyseal dysgenesis,delayed epiphyseal ossification,and shortenedverte
bral bodies are present in patients with congenital hypothyroidism; these pa-
tients frequently developradiographic signs of degenerative joint disease as
adults.
·Megacolon is a common radiographic finding in cats with congenital hy
pothyroidism.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
·Indices of left ventricular systolic function are commonly abnormal; these
changes are usually not clinically significant unless the dog has concurrent
primary heart disease.
·Electrocardiograpby--low-amplitude Rwaves are commonly observed,
bradycardia lessfrequently
PATHOLOGICFINDINGS
·Lymphocytic thyroiditis is characterized by a diffuse infiltration of lympho
cytes andplasma cellsintothe thyroidparenchyma,with eventual destruction
ot the gland.
Hypothyroidism
373
Liothyronine therapy is only indicated ifa dogfailsto achieve a normal serum
T4concentration following appropriate therapy with atleast two different
brands of L-thyroxine.
·Thisprobably indicates alack ofintestinalabsorption;liothyronine is almost
completely absorbed from the gut.
·The initial dosage is 4-6 mg/kg PO TID; final dosage is based on clinical re.
sponse and on serum T; levels in the normal range; some patients can be
maintained on BID therapy.
Comments
·Mental alertness and activity levels usually increase within 1-2 weeks after
initiation of therapy.
·Dermatologic abnormalities slowly resolve over 1-4 months,as do neuro
logic deficits that are secondary to hypothyroidism.
·Reproductive abnormalitiesresolve more slowly
·If significant clinical improvement does not occur within3months of initia
tion of therapy,with serumTlevels in the normal range,the diagnosis of hy
pothyroidism maybe incorrect.
·Check serum T4 levels after 1 month of therapy.
·Determine peak serum T4 concentrations 4-8 hr after L-thyroxine adminis-
tration.
·SerumT.concentrations should be in the normal range or mildly increased.
Patients on once-daily therapy that do not respond to therapy and have a nor-
mal orhighpeakT4concentration should have theirpre-pill T4concentration
(trough T4) assessed;if the trough T4concentration is low,twice-daily ther
apy is indicated.
·Following initial normalization of serum T4values,check them yearly, or
sooner if clinical signs of hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis develop.
·Recheck serum T. concentrations 1 month after any change in dosage or
brand of L-thyroxine being administered.
·Prolonged administration of an inappropriately high dosage of L-thyroxine
can cause iatrogenic hyperthyroidism.
·Clinical signs of thyrotoxicosis include panting. polyphagia,weight loss,
polyuria/polydipsia,anxiety,and diarrhea.
●Keep peak serum T4 concentrations at or below 7.5 mg/dL.
·Dogs treated for acquired primary hypothyroidism have an excellent prog-
nosis; life expectancy is normal.
·Patients with acquired central hypothyroidism may have a poor prognosis if
condition is secondary to a tumor or destructive process affecting the pitu-
itary or hypothalamus.
·Primary hypothyroidism has been reported to occur concurrently with pri-
mary hypoadrenocorticism and/or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in a
small number ofanimals.

Signalment/History
Considered one of the most common endocrine disordersin dogs;rarein cats
Dogs-oodlesdachshundsBostonerrierboxersandbeaglesarereor
edly at increasedrisk
·Cats—no apparent predilection
·No predilection for pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism（PDH）in
dogs;two-thirdsto three-quartersarefemale.
No apparent predilection in cats
·HAC is generally a disorder of middle-aged to old animals;PDH can be seen
in dogs as young as 1 year.
Clinical Features
Severitymayvarygreatly,dependingon the duration andseverity ofcortisol
excess.
·In some cases,the physical presence of the neoplastic process（pituitary or
adrenal) contributes.
·Polyuria and polydipsia
·Polyphagia
·Pendulous abdomen
Hepatomegaly
·Hair loss (Fig.59-1)
.Lethargy
·Muscleweakness
·Anestrus
.Obesity

·AT—use mitotane (goal is low-to-undetectable basal and post-ACTH corti-
sol levels) or administermitotane at highest tolerated dosage;give prednisone
at 0.2 mg/kg/day
·I-Deprenyl (selegiline hydrochloride; Anipryl, Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc.,
Topeka,KN)may be used as an alternative treatment for PDH; decreases
pituitary ACTH secretion by increasing dopaminergic tone to the hypothala-
mic-pituitary axis,thus decreasing serum cortisol concentrations; indicated
only for the treatment ofuncomplicated PDH;not recommended for treat
ment of PDH in dogs with concurrent illnesses such as diabetes mellirus; can-
not be used to treat cortisol-secreting adrenocortical neoplasia; initiate ther-
apy with 1 mg/kg daily and increase to 2 mg/kg/day after 2months if the
response is inadequate;if this dose is also ineffective,give alternative therapy
·The multicenter trial performed by Deprenyl Animal Health,Inc.reported
that 75-80% of dogs had a good response to therapy as assessed by resolu-
tion of clinical signs and monthly low-dose dexarmethasone suppression test-
ing; other investigators reported lower efficacy rates (50% or less in some
studies); further independent clinical trials are necessary to assess the efficacy
of this medication in controlling PDH; adverse effects such as anorexia,
lethargy,vomiting,and diarrhea areuncommon (<5% of dogs) and usually
mild; disadvantages include the need forlifelong daily administration and the
expense of the medication.
·Ketoconazole (10 mg/kg BID initially; up to 20 mg/kg BID in some dogs)
indicated for dogs unable to tolerate mitotane at doses necessary to control
HAC and preoperative control of HAC in dogs with AT scheduled for
adrenalectomy;may be useful for palliation of clinical signs ofHACin dogs
with AT; over one-third of dogs reportedly fail to respond adequately to the
drug; adverse effects include anorexia,vomiting,diarrhea,lethargy,and an
idiosyncratichepatopathy
·Feline HAC-the drug of choice for medical management is controversial;
further studies are needed;mitotane (50 mg/kg/day then 50mg/kg/week di-
vided, dosage adjustments based on ACTH response testing) or metyrapone
(65mg/kg BID to TID, dosage adjustments based on ACTH response testing)
should be considered;I-deprenyl is a newly described alternative for therapy
for canine PDH, but its use has not been described in cats with HAC; a short-
term safety study in normalcats revealed no significant adverse effects
PRECAUTIONS
·Side effects of mitotanenot uncommon;mild in most dogs;include
lethargy,weakness,anorexia,vomiting,diarrhea,ataxia,and iatrogenic hy
poadrenocorticism
·Side effects are more common in dogs with AT given high doses of mitotane.
·Side effects of ketoconazole-seem to be less common;include anorexia,
vomiting. diarrhea, and transient liver enzyme elevation
·Side effects of I-deprenyl are uncommon.
ALTERNATIVE DRUGS
·Consider radiation therapy for animals with pituitary macroadenomas.
·ACTH levels may take several months to decrease; control HAC with above
drugs in the interim.

PATIENTMONITORING
·Response to therapy-use periodic ACTH response testing (see references);
test after the initial 7-10 days of mitotane or ketoconazole therapy to ensure
adequateresponse,then at 1,3,and 6months ofmaintenancemitotane ther-
apy and every 6-12months thereafter; adequacy of any necessary mitotane
reloading periodis checkedwith an ACTH response testbefore higher main-
tenance mitotane doseinitiated;depending on the problem,clinical signsre
solve within several days to months of appropriate therapy; current label rec-
ommendations are to evaluate the efficacy of l-deprenyl therapy solely on the
basis ofresolution ofclinical signs of HAC;theACTHstimulation test is not
indicatedfor assessing theresponse to treatment
·Some clinicians choose to do low-dose dexamethasone suppression tests ev
ery 4-6weeks to evaluate for normalization (or improvement) of the pitu-
itary-adrenal axis.
EXPECTED COURSE/PROGNOSIS
·Untreated HAC—generally a progressive disorder with a poor prognosis
·TreatedPDHusually agoodprognosis;the average survival time fora dog
withPDH treated with mitotane is 2years; at least 10% survive 4 years; dogs
living longer than 6months tend to die of causes unrelated to theirHAC
·Macroadenomas and neurologic signs—poor to grave prognosis
·Adrenal adenomasusually a good to excellent prognosis; small carcinomas
(not metastasized)have a fair to good prognosis
·Large carcinomas and ATwith widespread metastasis-generally a poor to
fair prognosis,but impressive responses to high doses of mitotane are occa-
sionally seen

DERMATOSES
MargaretS.Swartout
Definition/Overview
·Uncommon dermatosesresultingfrom a growth hormone deficiency or der-
matosesrespondingtogrowthhormonetherapy
·Pituitary dwarfism-theresult of a primarygrowth hormone deficiency
·Adult-onsetgrowth hormone-responsive dermatosis-aclinical syndrome
thatresponds to growth hormone therapy;patientsmay be strictly growth
hormone-deficient;may have one or more of a plethora of hormonal abnor-
malities,includingpossibleimbalancesofadrenalsexhormones
Etiology/Pathophysiology
PITUITARYDWARFISM
·Pituitary dwarfism-mediated by an autosomalrecessive trait,whichresults
ina developmentalabnormality of the pituitary and lack ofgrowth hormone
production
ADULT-ONSET
·Adult-onset-unknown;breed predisposition suggests a hereditary influence;
pituitaryneoplasiahasbeen suggested
Although an absolutegrowthhormonedeficiencymaybenoted,othercauses
maylead to a similar clinical syndrome thatrespondstogrowth hormone
supplementation(e.g.,castration-responsive dermatosis,congenital adrenal
hyperplasia-like syndrome).

Skin biopsy-general endocrinopathy; orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis;epider-
malatrophy;follicularkeratosis,dilation,and atrophy;tlogenizationof hair
follicles;atrophy of sebaceous glands; amounts and sizes of dermal elastin
fibers are small; castration-responsive or growth hormone-responsive der-
matoses(dogs)-hypereosinophilic tricholemmalkeratinization of hair folli-
cles ("flame follicles")
Therapeutics
·L-Thyroxine-0.02mg/kgPOq12h for a 6-week trial;recommended if the
baseline total Tis low or lownormal
·o,p'-DDD (Lysodren)—15-25mg/kg PO q24h for 2-7 days;an ACTH-stim-
ulation test to evaluate the response should demonstrate suppression of the
baseline cortisol toa low-normal range; poststimulation range is 30-50
ng/mL (3.0-5.0 μg/dL); conduct ACTH-stimulation testing quarterly
·Methyltestosterone-1mg/kg(maximum dose,30 mg/dog)POq48h for a
maximum of 3months;after hair regrowth,maintain at 1mg/kg(maximum
dose,30mg/dog)PO every 4-7 days
·Bovine,porcine,or synthetichuman growth hormone0.15IU/kg SC twice
weekly for 6weeks;may repeat if noresponse within3 months
·Intact male dogs-neuter to rule out castration-responsive dermatosis
Comments
Growth hormones-monitorbloodglucose before eachtreatment;growth
hormone is diabetogenic
·Methyltestosteronecholangiohepatitis,seborrhea,and behavioral changes;
monitor liver enzymes and clinical status
·Ifpost-ACTH stimulation blood cortisols are too low,evaluate serum elec-
trolytes to determine the need for mineralocorticoid treatment.
·Growth hormone therapy-anaphylaxis with repeated dosing; diabetes mel-
litus(transient or permanent)
·Pituitary dwarfism-hair regrowthwill begin within 4-8weeks of beginning
therapy and lasts 6months to 2years;retreatment is usually necessary
·Adult-onset--hair regrowth is usually observed in 2-12weeks after therapy
and lasts 6months to3 years;retreatment is often necessary
·o,p'-DDD—gives a good prognosis for hair regrowth if imbalance of adrenal
sex hormone concentrations is suspected;may be a transient increase in epi-
lation,buthair regrowthmay benoted 4-12weeks after beginning therapy
Signs are confined to the skin,so treatment is notmandatory; owners may de-
cline therapybecause of the possible side effects.

SEX HORMONE-RESPONSIVE
DERMATOSES
Margaret S.Swartout
Definition/Overview
Uncommon alopeciasanddermatosessuspectedtoresult from animbalance of sex
hormones;oftendefined on thebasisof stimulatoryresponse tosexhormone
Signalment/History
ESTROGEN-RESPONSIVE-FEMALES(OVARIAN IMBALANCEII)
·Possible deficiency orimbalance of estrogen;serum estradiol concentrations
maybenormal
·Inadequateproductionof adrenal sexhormones
·Cutaneous defect in the sexhormonereceptor/metabolism system
·Rare in dogs
·Extremelyrare incats
·Predisposed breeds-dachshunds and boxers
·Primarily seen in young adults
Mayoccur afterovariohysterectomyinnoncyclingntact females
·Occasionally seen duringpseudopregnancy
Variant-cyclical flank alopecia and hyperpigmentation;noted inAiredales,
boxers,andEnglish bulldogs;may worsenin winter
HYPERESTROGENISM-FEMALES(OVARIAN IMBALANCEI)
·Estrogen excess orimbalance（Fig.61-1)tocystic ovaries,ovarian tumors
(rare),or exogenous estrogen overdose
387

The 5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
Clinical Features
·Alopecia--localized alopecia more common than generalized; initialy in-
volves the perineum,ventrum,thighs,and cervical areas;later involves the
caudodorsalback and flank;flank alopecia may be the first or only sign in
some patients with hyperestrogenism and may be seasonal in some spayed fe-
males
·Fur-may be soft or dry and brittle
Nipples,mammaryglands,vulva,prepuce,testicle,ovaries,andprostat
often abnormal
Secondary seborrhea,pruritus,pyoderma,comedones,ceruminous otitis ex-
terna,andhyperpigmentation-variable
·Tail gland hyperplasia and perianal gland hyperplasia with macular
melanosis-dogs with testicular tumors
·Urinary incontinence-estrogen-and testosterone-responsive conditions
DifferentialDiagnosis
·Hypothyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism-critical to rule outfirst; these
diseases generally cause truncal alopecia first
·REMEMBER: sex hormones can change the affinity of binding proteins, so that
the baseline total T4 can be normal or above normal in dogs with hyperan-
drogenemia or hypoestrogenemia.
·Growth hormone-responsive/adrenal hyperplasia dermatosis
·Follicular dysplasia
·Dachshunds—pattern baldness
·Keratinization disorders
·Allergic skin disease
Diagnostics
·Bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia are noted occasionally in states of estro-
gen excess,owing to testicular tumors in male and hyperestrogenism in fe-
male dogs.
·Serum estrogen/estradiol concentrationssometimes high(30-40%of pa-
tients)withhyperestrogenism of female dogs,hyperestrogenism inmale dogs
with testiculartumors,and castration-responsive dermatosis;rarely helpful in
estrogen-responsive dermatosis,because serum estradiol 17β concentrations
in spayed females are similar to those inintact females
·Serum testosterone and progesterone-sometimes elevated in animals with
castration-responsive dermatosis; occasionally elevated with hyperestro-
genism (ovarian imbalance) in female dogs
·Serum sex hormone concentrations-often normal; treat according to the
suspecteddiagnosisbasedonclinical signs,byrulingoutotherdisorders,nd
by noting the response to therapy
COMBINED ACTHSTIMULATION AND ADRENAL REPRODUCTIVEHORMONETEST
·Obtain plasma and serum before injection;administer ACTH (cosyntropin
0.5 IU/kg IV or ACTH gel 0.22 USP U/kg IM); obtain plasma and serum 1 hr
later (and a 2-hr sample if ACTH gel is used).
SexHormone-ResponsiveDermatoses
391
·Partial deficiency of 21-hydroxylase enzyme results in accumulation of
steroid precursors (e.g,progesterone,17-hydroxyprogesterone,androstene-
dione,and DHEAS),resulting in dermatosis of Pomeranians and other
breeds; clinically similar to growth hormone-responsive dermatosis
GNRH (CYSTORELIN) RESPONSE TEST
·Demonstrates response of gonads to stimulation
·Especially useful when basal hormones arenormal
·Determine baseline serum estradiol,testosterone,andprogesteronebeforein
jection; administer GnRH (0.22 mg/kg IV); obtain serum samples 1-2 hr
later; determine levels of the three sex hormones;values vary with lab.
·Radiography, ultrasonography, and laparoscopy-detect cystic ovaries,
ovarian tumors,testicular tumors(scrotal and abdominal), sublumbar lym-
phadenopathy,and possible thoracicmetastases of malignant tumors
·Preputial cytologymay demonstrate cornification of cells (similar to bitch
in estrus) in advanced patients with testicular feminizing tumors
PATHOLOGICFINDINGS
·General endocrinopathy findings (see above)—all syndromes,except hyper
androgenism owingtotesticulartumors
·Perivascular dermatitis-may be seen in pruritic animals (male feminizing
syndrome,hyperestrogenism of femaledogs)
·Sebaceous glands-relatively spared in estrogen-responsive dermatosis of fe-
male dogs and in testosterone-responsive dermatosis of male dogs
·Hair follicles-—hypereosinophilic tricholemmal keratinization(*flame folli-
cles")maybe seenwith castration-responsive dermatosis
Therapeutics
Cryptorchid animals—do not breed(prevention and avoidance of problems);
neuter when young
·Exploratorylaparotomy-diagnosisand treatment(e.g.,ovariohysterectomy
and castration)for ovarian cysts and tumors andabdominal testiculartumors
·Castration-castration-responsive dermatosis and scrotal testicular tumors
·Discontinue excessive exogenous estrogen administration.
ESTROGEN-RESPONSIVEDERMATOSIS
Spayed females-DES at 0.02 mg/kg(maximum,1mg) PO q24h for 14-21
days; stop for 1 week;repeat cycle until hair regrowth; then give 2-3 times
weekly to maintain hair coat； discontinue during estrus and resume mainte-
nance whenestrus subsides;if noresponse,trymethytestosterone(seebelow)
or milbolerone(at 30μg[dogs <11kgl or 50 μg [dogs 11-23kgl)until hair
regrowth and then taper to maintenance
·Intact females-DES(5mgPOq24h)until bloody discharge;if no response
after7days,double the dose; give until proestrus day 2 (maximum,14 days
total) until sanguineous vaginal discharge andvulvar edema are noted;then
for 2 days more;then LH(5 mg IM)on day5 of proestrus; thenFSH on days
9and 11 ofproestrus

STEROIDHEPATOPATHY
Keith P.Richter
Definition/Overview
Reversiblevacuolar change in hepatocytes in dogs,associatedwith glucocorticoid
treatment,hyperadrenocorticism (iatrogenic or spontaneous）,or chronicillnesses in
other organ systems;typified by highALPactivitywithout signs ofhepatic insuffi-
ciency
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Glucocorticoids-cause reversible glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes
within 2-3 days after administration;injectable andreposital forms usually
inducemore severe changes than do oral forms;topical,ocular,cutaneous,
andaural administration may also produce aneffect
·Cell swelling-leads toparenchymalenlargement andhepatomegaly
Response (dogs）-marked individual variation related to the type,route,
dosage,duration of treatment,and individual sensitivity;may develop even
with low-dose,short-term oralmedication
Maydevelopwithsystemic diseasesnotrelated toglucocorticoidexposure or
hyperadrenocorticism
Associationwith significant nonhepatobiliary health problems thatinvolve
inflammation-suggests arelationship with stress (endogenous glucocorti-
coidrelease)oracute-phasereactants
CAUSES
Glucocorticoid administration
Hyperadrenocorticism
394
Steroid Hepatopathy
395
Other adrenal gland hyperfunction-overproduction of sexhormones
·Systemic diseases associated with an acute-phase response or stress-severe
dental disease;inflammatory bowel disease; chronic pancreatitis; systemic
neoplasia (especially lymphoma); chronic infections(urinary tract, skin);hy
pothyroidism;inborn errors of lipid metabolism (lipid and glycogen accumu-
late in hepatocytes)
Signalment/History
·Dogs—common; occurs in up to 33% of patients undergoing liver biopsy;
many patients identified through laboratory and imaging studies.Catsex-
tremely rare;usually hepatic lipidosis
·Breeds predisposed to hyperadrenocorticism (dachshunds, poodles, beagles,
boxers,Boston terriers)and hyperlipidemia
·Middle-aged to old dogs-when caused by spontaneous hyperadrenocorti-
cism (>75%older than 9years);when caused by chronic inflammation or
neoplasia
·Dogs of any age--iatrogenic disease subsequent to glucocorticoid adminis-
tration
·Young dogs-idiopathic hyperlipidemia
RISK FACTORS
·Pharmacologicdosesofglucocorticoids
·Breeds atriskforhyperadrenocorticism
adrenal mass
Other systemic conditions-see Causes
Breeds atriskforhyperlipidemiaschnauzers,shelties,beagles
Clinical Features
Often related tomultisystemic effects of glucocorticoids or another systemic
illness causing stress
·Rarely note signs of hepatic disease or failure
·Glucocorticoid excess-polydipsia and polyuria;polyphagia;endocrine
alopecia;abdominal distention;muscle weakness;panting;lethargy
·Other causes-depend on the affected system
·Hepatomegaly
·Relate to glucocorticoid excess or theunderlying disease; depend on severity
oenp pue
·Adrenal overproduction of sex hormones—endocrine alopecia with hyper-
pigmentation
Differential Diagnosis
·Most other diffusehepatopathies(especially those causing hepatomegaly and
high serum hepatic enzyme activities)—passive congestion; neoplasia (primary
ormetastaticto theliver);inflammatory disease;anticonvulsant hepatopathy;
hepatocellular swelling associated with diabetes mellitus (lipidvacuolation)
396
The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
·Distinguishing features-normal serum total bilirubin concentration;normal
tomild abnormalities in hepatic function tests (total serum bile acids concen-
trations);homogenous hyperechoic liver on ultrasonography; characteristic
morphologic findings on hepatic fine-needle aspiration and biopsy
·If laboratory and clinical signs are compatiblewith the disorder and another
underlying cause is not evident or the patient is symptomatic for hypera-
drenocorticism,assess the pituitary-adrenal axis.
·Thorough physical assessment--essential; strong association with chronic ill-
ness
Diagnostics
CBC
·Depends on underlying disease
·Nonregenerative anemia-chronic inflammatory disease or hypothyroidism
·Relativepolycythemia--hyperadrenocorticism
·Stress leukogram--hyperadrenocorticism; treatment with glucocorticoids;
stress of other illness
·Thrombocytosis-hyperadrenocorticism
BIOCHEMISTRY
·ALP and GGT-markedly high serum activities;GGTactivity usually paral-
lels that of ALPand cannot differentiate from other disorders
·ALT and AST—moderate increase
·Serum albumin and total bilirubinusually normal; high bilirubin is unusual
and indicates another hepatobiliary or hemolytic disease process
·Hypercholesterolemia-hyperadrenocorticism;some inborn errors of lipid
metabolism;hypothyroidism; pancreatitis
·Total serum bile acidsmay be normal or slightly to moderately high (up to
~75μmol/L)
·Ammonia tolerance test-usually normal
·ALP glucocorticoid isoenzyme-always high in dogs with hyperadrenocorti-
cism; also high in affected dogs without associated hyperadrenocorticism;
sensitive for ruling outhyperadrenocorticismbut cannot differentiate causes
·Pituitary-adrenal axis-evaluated with ACTH-response test or dexametha-
sone-suppression tests;document and differentiate types of hyperadrenocor-
ticism
·High urine cortisol:creatinine ratiosuggests hyperadrenocorticism;lessre-
liable than ACTH-response test or LDDST (spurious increases may occur in
stressed patients)
·ACTH-stimulation test-blunted in patients receiving glucocorticoids
·Thyroid testingrule out hypothyroidism
IMAGING
·Abdominal radiography-reveals hepatomegaly and other underlying condi-
tions
·Thoracicradiography-evaluated forlymphadenopathy ormetastatic disease
when hyperadrenocorticism is not noted;provides evidence of other primary
disease process
SteroidHepatopathy
397
·Abdominal ultrasonography-reveals hepatomegaly and diffuse or multifo-
calhyperechoic hepaticparenchyma; withmultifocal disease,may observe a
nodular-like pattern;may disclose evidence of underlying primary visceral
disease,mesenteric lymphadenopathy,and adrenal size (often enlarged in
stressed dogs)
DIAGNOSTICPROCEDURES
·Hepatic aspiration cytology-—23-or 25-gauge,2.5-3.75-cm(1-1.5-in)nee-
dle;may aspirate diffusely enlarged liver without ultrasonography; aspirate
representative regions with multifocal echogenic pattern, sampling tissue
with different echogenicity
·Hepatic biopsy-verify vacuolar change; exclude primary hepatic disease if
other systemic diagnoses have not been made;method:ultrasound-guided
needle,laparoscopy,orlaparotomy
·Cytologic evaluationmay note inflammatory infiltrates,neoplasia,and ob
vious vacuolar orrarefied appearance of hepatocellularcytosol;expectbilein
hepatocytesandcanalicularcastsbetweenhepatocyteswithseveredisease
·Tissue evaluationwith suspected suppuration,initiate microbial culture
(aerobic andanaerobicbacterial;fungal,if appropriate);pecial stains:AS
with andwithout amylase to discern glycogen
·CoagulationassessmentPT,APTT,ACT,fibrinogen,PIVKA,and mucosal
bleeding time;indicated before liverbiopsy
PATHOLOGICFINDINGS
·Gross-variable;normal liver;mild to moderate hepatomegaly;mild surface
irregularity; loss of normal lobular pattern
·Microscopic-abnormalities usually pathognomonic;marked vacuolization
andballooning ofhepatocytes ina centrilobular or diffuse distribution;mild
hepatic necrosis;extramedullaryhematopoiesis;small focalaggregates of
neutrophils
Therapeutics
·Hyperlipidemia and pancreatitis-fat restriction
·Adrenocortical masses may beresected
·Piruitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticismusually treated medically once
diagnosis is confirmed;o,p'-DDD (mitotane,Lysodren),ketoconazole,or L-
deprenyl
·Management of causal inflammatory conditions that may require immuno-
suppressive or anti-inflammatorymedications-usevery low dosages of glu-
cocorticoids combinedwith other medications (see Alternative Drugs)
·Neoplasiatumor resection and/or chemotherapy
·Dental disease—antibiotic therapy; appropriate dental procedures

Comments
PRECAUTIONS
·Glucocorticoids
-use caution when administering glucocorticoids to all pa-
tients;use an alternate-day protocol to reduce the severity of the disorder and
the influence on the pituitary-adrenal axis;use caution when administering
to dogs withinborn errors of lipid metabolism (schnauzers are at greatest risk
of developing severe disease)
PATIENT MONITORING
·Hepatomegaly—abdominal palpation and radiography
·Normalizing enzymes--biochemistry
·Hyperadrenocorticism—ACTH-stimulation test to assess treatment efficacy
·Neoplasiarepeat physical examinations andimaging studies
·Control of infection-repeating cultures(e.g.,urine)
·Hyperlipidemiaplasmalipemia,triglycerides,andcholesterol
PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE
·Limit administration of glucocorticoids to confirmed conditions requiring
anti-inflammatory orimmunosuppressive therapy.
·Use alternate-day therapy and titrate to the lowest effective dose to minimize
risk.
PROGNOSIS
·Some patients do not develop disorder even with chronic glucocorticoid ther-
apy.
weeks even after short-term glucocorticoid therapy.

·Iatrogenic-secondary to excessive corticosteroid orprogestational druguse
·Diabetes mellitus-rare,unless associated with hyperadrenocorticism
·Possibly idiopathic
Signalment/History
·Naturally occurring disease tends to be recognized in old cats.
·Iatrogenic cases have noage predilection.
·No breed or sex predilection
·Gradual onset of clinical signs
·Progressive alopecia(not always present)(Fig.63-1)
Oftenassociatedwithweightloss,lusterlesscoat,oor appetite,andlackf

·Drugreactions,erythema multiforme,and toxicepidermal necrolysis-nasal
and facial lesions
·Dermatomyositis-—affects some of the same predisposed breeds (collies and
Shetland sheepdogs)
·Nasalpyoderma and nasal dermatophytosisinfectious conditions;can
mimic discoid lupus erythematosus
·Insect hypersensitivity—one form creates a nasal inflammatory disease
·Contact allergy
·Zinc-responsive dermatosis
·Metabolic epidermal necrosis
·T cell epidermotropic lymphoma—may start on the planum and rostral as-
pect of the muzzle and lips
·Squamous cell carcinoma—may affect the planum; may occur at a slightly
higher incidencein chronic discoid lupus lesions
·Idiopathic leukoderma leukotrichia(vitiligo)—may cause depigmentation of
thetissue and hair without concurrentinflammation
Diagnostics
·ANA,LE preparation, and Coombs testsusually normal or negative
·Biopsies of nonulcerated,slate-gray depigmented lesions-often character-
izedbyinterfacelichenoiddermatitiswithpigmentincontinence andvariable
degrees of dermal mucin
·Immunopathologic examination ofnonulcerated samples preserved in
Michel's solution—may reveal positive basal laminal fluorescence
Therapeutics
DRUGS
·Tetracycline and niacinamide—250 mg each POq8h for dogs <10kg;500
mg PO q8h for larger dogs
·Vitamin E—10-20IU/kg POq12h;mayhelp reduce inflammation
Topical corticosteroids—initially, a potent fluorinated product (e.g., 0.1%
amcinonide)q24h for 14 days; thenq48-72h for 28 days;if in remission
switch to less-potent product (e.g.,0.5% or 2.5% hydrocortisone)
·Prednisone-consider for severe or nonresponsive cases; 2-3 mg/kg daily ei-
ther solelyor in combination with azathioprine 2mg/kgPOon alternate
days;taper prednisone to 0.5-1 mg/kg POq48hforlong-term maintenance
Comments
·Recheck 14 days after initiating treatment for clinical response.
·CBC and biochemistry-every 3-6 months if using topical or oral corticos-
teroids for control
·CBCand platelet counts-—every 2weeks for the first 3-4 months;then every
3-6months while on azathioprine
●Avoid using affected animals for breeding.

·May createa source of trauma-inducedbleeding
·Avoid direct solar exposure and use waterproof sunblocks with an SPF > 15.
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
·Scarring
·Secondary pyoderma
·Bleeding
·Disfigurement
EXPECTED COURSE AND PROGNOSIS
·Progressivebutnot usually life-threatening if left untreated
·With proper treatment,expect remission in most cases.
·The need for chronic immunosuppressive therapy suggests a more guarded
prognosis,but remissions are common with more aggressive therapy.

Definition/Overview
Amultisystem autoimmune diseasecharacterizedby the formation ofautoanti-
bodies against a wide array of self-antigens andcirculating immune complexes
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Causeunknown
·Animmunoregulatory defect causes theproduction of autoantibodiestonon-
gens.
·Immune complexesareformedand depositedin the glomerular basement
membrane,synovialmembrane,skin,bloodvessels,andother sits.
·Tissue injury-caused by activation of complement by immune complexes
and infiltration of inflammatory cells andby a direct cytotoxiceffect of au-
toantibodies againstmembrane-bound antigens
Clinical manifestations dependon thelocalizationof the immune complexes
andthespecificityoftheautoantibodies.

Differential Diagnosis
Neoplastic disease-may be associated with circulating immune complexes;
patient may have similar signs as SLE.
·Important to rule out infectious disease, because SLE is treated with im-
munosuppressive drugs.
Diagnostics
·Definitive diagnosispositive ANA or LE cell test (or both) and two major
signsoronemajorandtwominorsigns
·Probable diagnosis—positive ANA or LE cell test (or both) and one major or
twominor signs
·Major signspolyarthritis,proteinuria,dermatitis,hemolytic anemia,
leukopenia,thrombocytopenia,andpolymyositis
·Minor signs—fever of unknown origin,oral ulcers, peripheral lym-
phadenopathy,leuritis,ricarditimyocarditis,dresion,andsizur
·CBC-anemia,leukopenia,and thrombocytopenia;leukocytosis(i.e.,mono-
cytosisandneutrophilia)resultingfrom chronicinflammation
·Anemiamoderate and nonregenerative (e.g., anemia of chronic disease） or
severe and regenerative (e.g.,hemolytic)
·Biochemical analysis—results vary widely, depending on the organ(s) af
fected
·High urine protein:urine creatinineratio(>1)indicates true proteinuria that
may be caused by glomerulonephritis.
·Patients with hemolytic anemia may have bilirubinuria.
Serum electrophoresisusually shows highconcentration of β-and-globulins
·ANA testa sensitive assay;positive results support diagnosis of SLE;false-
positive results associated with some infectious diseases (e.g.,leishmaniasis
and subacute bacterial endocarditis in dogs;FeLV,cholangiohepatitis,and
treatment with propylthiouracil in cats)
·LE test—positive result supports diagnosis of SLE; less sensitive than the
ANA test and cumbersome to perform
·Directantiglobulin test(Coombs test)positive inpatients with immune-
mediated hemolytic anemia
·Radiograpby of affectedjoints reveals nonerosive arthritis,unlike the erosive
lesions ofrheumatoid arthritis.
·Arthrocentesis in patients with lameness or swollen joints;high cell count,
withnondegenerate neutrophils andmonocytesandlowviscosityis achar-
acteristic finding.
·Bacterial culture of synovialfluid isnegative.
·Skin biopsy in patients with skin lesions; save specimen in10%buffered for-
malin(for histopathologic examination)and Michel's solution (forim-
munofluorescence testing).
SystemicLupusErythematosus
429
ALTERNATIVEDRUGS
Cyclosporine(5-10mg/kg PO q12h) may be tried in refractory patients;use with
cautionandwithdrawif sideeffectsoccur（e.ggastritislymphocytoid dermatitis,
papillomatosis,andgingivalhyperplasia).
Comments
·Weekly physicalexamination
·CBC and biochemical analysis to monitor side effects of theimmunosuppres-
sive drugs,initially weekly
·ANA remains high during remission and is not useful for monitoring the dis-
ease.
·Do not breed affected animals.
Renal failure andnephrotic syndrome secondary toglomerulonephritis a con
cern
·Prognosis guarded to poor
·Thepresence of hemolytic anemia andglomerulonephritis and the develop
ment of bacterial infectionwarrant a poor prognosis.

·Sterile nodular panniculitis-systemic treatment with steroids;prednisone
(2.2mg/kg daily）until lesions completely regress(36weeks);afterremission,
gradually taper dosage over 2weeks;occasionallymay need slower taper to
minimize chance of recurrence;many patients cured;some patients need low-
dosealternate-day treatment tomaintain remission
OralvitaminE-may controlmildcases
Panniculitis
435
·Oral potassium iodide or azathioprine (1 mg/kg daily)—alternatives when
steroidsarecontraindicated
·Immunosuppressive agents (i.e. azathioprine)
Comments
·Monitor CBC,platelet count, chemistry profile, and urinalysis if immune-
suppressing agents or long-term glucocorticosteroids are used.
·Infectious cases may require long-term therapy with high doses of medica-
tions.
·Sterile idiopathicnodular panniculitis often responds quite rapidly to high
doses of corticosteroids.Young animals have a more rapid recovery than
older animals, which may require a maintenance protocol.

·Vasculitis-pentoxifylline; published doses vary;400 mg q24-48h has been
recommended
·Alkylating agents including chlorambucil and azathioprinehave been added
to regimens to decease the need for corticosteroids.
CONTRAINDICATIONS/POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS
·Dapsone and sulfasalazine-not recommended with pre-existing renal dis-
ease,hepatic disease,orblood dyscrasias
·Sulfasalazine—not recommended with pre-existing or borderline keratocon-
junctivitis sicca;use with caution in cats; may displace highly protein-bound
drugs (e.g.,methotrexate,warfarin,henylbutazone,thiazide diuretics,sali-
cylates,probenecid,and phenytoin);bioavailability decreased by antacids;
may decreasebioavailability of folic acid or digoxin;blood levels may be de-
creased if concurrently administeringferrous sulfate or other iron salts
·Pentoxifylline-may increase prothrombin times;may decrease bloodpres-
sure
Comments
·Patients receiving prednisolone or dapsone--initially monitor every 2weeks
with a CBC,chemistry screen,and urinalysis if a specific underlying disease
isfound,thenmonitorappropriately
·If no underlying disease is found,vasculitis maybe difficult to treat and the
prognosis is guarded.
·Immunosuppressive therapies should always be reduced to the lowest possi-
ble therapeutic dose.

CATS
·Anorexiamostcommon complaintwith splenic tumor
·Vomiting-may occur secondary to both splenic andgastrointestinal tumors
Clinical Features

·Regional lymphadenopathy-may develop when ahigh-grade tumor metas-
tasizestodraininglymphnodes
·Hepatomegaly andsplenomegaly-features of disseminated mast cell neopla-
sia
CATS
·Cutaneousprimarily found in the subcutaneous tissue or dermis;may be
papularornodularsolitary ormultiple,and hairy oralopecic orhaveanl
cerated surface; slight predilection for the head and neck regions (Figs.75-1,

Diagnostics
·Anemia andmastocythemia—may find in cats with splenic tumor and dogs
with systemicmastocytosis
Abdominal radiography—may reveal splenomegaly in cats with splenic tu-
mor and dogs with systemicmastocytosis
·Ultrasonography-helpful for evaluating visceral (liver,spleen)metastasis in
dogswith high-gradetumors
·Cytologic examination of fine-needle aspiratemost important preliminary
diagnostic test;reveals round cells with basophilic cytoplasmic granules that
do not form sheets or clumps;if malignantmast cells are often agranular,oc-
currence of a large eosinophilic infiltrate may suggest mast cell tumor
·Tissue biopsy-necessary for definitive diagnosis and grading
·Staging-todetermine the extent of diseaseand appropriate treatment
·Additional tests to achieve complete staging-cytologic examination or
biopsy of local draining lymph node;cytologicexamination of bone marrow
aspirate;and thoracicradiography and abdominalultrasonography with cy-
tologic evaluation ofhepatic andsplenicaspirates
·Histopathologic examination(dogs)grading of tumor to predict biologic
behavior; graded IIl(II is themost aggressive type)
Cats—grading systemnotbeneficial;no correlation between histopathologic
appearance of cutaneoustumor andprognosis
Therapeutics
DoGS
·Aggressive surgical excision—-treatment of choice
·Histopathologic evaluation of the entire surgically excisedtissue-essentialto
determine completeness of excision andpredict the biologic behavior;if tu-
mor cells extend close to the surgicalmargins,perform a second aggressive
surgery as soon as possible.
·Lymph node involvement but no systemic involvement——aggressive excision
of the affected lymph node(s) and the primary tumor required;follow-up
chemotherapyuseful to prevent furthermetastasis
·Primary tumor and/or affected lymph node cannot be excisedchemother-
apy has minimal benefit.
·Systemic metastasisexcision of primary tumor and affected lymph nodes
and follow-up chemotherapy have minimal effect on survival time.
·Radiotherapy-good treatment optionfor cutaneous tumor inalocation that
does not allow aggressive surgical excision; if possible,perform surgery be-
foreradiotherapy to reduce thetumor to amicroscopicvolume;tumors on an
extremity respond better than do tumors located on the trunk.
CATS
·Surgery-treatment of choice for cutaneous tumors
●Splenectomy-treatment of choice forsplenictumor
companiessplenictumor
MastCell Tumors
469
SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
·Complete surgical excision with 2-cm margins in all planes--vital
·Excisional biopsyrather than incisional biopsy—necessary
·Biopsy of lymph nodes and other suspicious visceral organsappropriate
DRUGS
·Prednisone--has been mainstay; recent evidence suggests that,used alone,
achieves only short-term remission
Other drugs (e.g.,vinblastine and cyclophosphamide)add to lengthen the
remission ofprednisone-sensitive tumors
ment appropriate;in authors experience,prednisone andchemotherapynot
beneficial for aggressive tumors in cats
·Prednisone-resistant tumor--chemotherapy does not appear to be beneficial
●Intestinal tumor and systemic mastocytosis after splenectomy (cats)-pred-
nisone and chemotherapy indicated
·Measurable tumor (dogs)vincristine alone induced partial remission in
21% of patients
Combination Chemotherapy
Author'spreferred treatment
●Prednisone—1 mg/kg PO q24h; taper slowly after 4 months; discontinue af-
ter 7months
Vinblastine-2-3mg/m²IV; administer on day 1 of each 21-day cycle; ini-
tiate at a dosage of 2 mg/m²;increase by 10-30% with each subsequent cy
cle, depending on tolerance and response (e.g,check CBC 1 week after ad-
ministration); perform CBC before each administration; continue for 6
months
Cyclophosphamide-250-300mg/m²PO dividedover4days;administer on
days 8,9,10,and11 of each21-day cycle; initiate at250mg/m²for twocy-
cles; increase to 300 mg/m²for cycle 3 if well tolerated; continue for 6
months
ALTERNATIVEDRUGS
Histamine-blocking agents (e.g., cimetidine)-helpful,particularly for systemic
mastocytosis or whenmassive histamine release is a concern
Comments

PARANEOPLASTIC
SYNDROME
Karen L. Campbel
Definition/Overview
·Rare-only seven reported cases
Characterized by cutaneouslesions,which serve as markers of internal neo-
plasia
Etiology/Pathophysiology
·Most affectedcatshavehadpancreatic adenocarcinomaswith metastases to
liver,lungs,leura,and/orperitoneum;onereportofbileductcarcinoma
·The link between internalmalignancies and cutaneous lesions is unknown;
mayinvolve cytokinesproducingatrophy of the hair follicles
·Skin/Exocrine-alopecia
·Gastrointestinal-weightloss,anorexia
Other systems-result ofmetastasis of the pancreatic orbiliary tumor (e.g.,
liver,lungs,pleura,and/orperitoneal cavity)
Signalment/History
·All affected animalsweremixed-breed or domestic shorthair cats.
·Meanage,12.5years;rangeof9-16years
·Six caseswere male.
·Decrease in appetitefollowedbyrapidweight lossand excessive shedding

Pruritus-variable;sometimeswith excessivegrooming
Hair loss-rapidly progressive
Someaffectedcatsmaybereluctant towalk,owingtopainful fissuringof the
footpads.
Clinical Features
·Hairs epilate easily
Severe alopecia—ventral neck,abdomen,and medial thighs(Fig.81-1)
The stratum corneum may“peel,leading to a glistening appearance to the
skin(Fig.81-2)
·Gray lentiginesmay develop in alopecic areas.
·Footpadsmay be fissuredand/or scaly(Fig.81-3).
Differential Diagnosis
Hyperadrenocorticismpolyuria,polydipsia,andskinfragility
Hyperthyroidism—polyphagia
·Hypothyroidism-spontaneous condition rare in cats;notassociated with

·Skin scrapings-rule out demodicosis
·KOH examination of hairs and/or fungal culture-rule out dermatophytosis
Ultrasonographypancreaticmass and/or nodular lesions in theliver orperi-
toneal cavity;failure to demonstrate nodules does not exclude the diagnosis,
because they may be too small for detection
●Thoracic radiographs—metastatic lesions in the lungs or pleural cavity
·Skin biopsies
·Laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy-identify primary and metastatic
tumors
PATHOLOGICFINDINGS
·Histopathologic examination of the skin-nonscarring alopecia; severe atro-
phy of hair follicles and adnexa;miniaturization of hair bulbs;mild acantho-
sis;variable absence of stratum corneum;variable mixed superficial perivas-
cularinfiltratesofneutrophils,osinophils,andmononuclearcells
·Primary tumorusually pancreatic adenocarcinoma,one case with a primary
bile duct carcinoma
·Metastaticnodulescommonin the liver,lungs,pleura,and peritoneum
Therapeutics
·Chemotherapy or other--no reported response; all cases have had metastatic
disease at the time of diagnosis
·Affected animals rapidly deteriorate; euthanasia should be suggested as a hu-
mane intervention.
·Supportive care—only if owners refuse to consider euthanasia;feed highly
palatable,nutrient-dense foods,and/or tube feed.
Comments
·Progressive deterioration
·Supportive care—ultrasonography and thoracic radiographs may demon-
strate progression of metastatic disease
·Expect death to occur within 2-8 weeks after onset of skin lesions.

ondary bacterial dermatitis is present,treatwith topical antibioticpreparations.If
severe,systemic antibioticsmay benecessary.The environment should also be
cleaned.All materials that are disposable should be replaced.The cage and the
housing areas should be treatedwith anti-parasiticidal applications.Care should be
taken to cleanse these areas of all antiparasiticidal preparations before re-intro-
ducing theguinea pigs.If thisis anolder guinea pigthat hasan acute miteinfesta

KarenRosenthal
Definition/Overview
Whenrabbitskinisexposedtourinefor an extendedlengthof time,inflammation
of the skinwith a secondarybacterial dermatitiscan occur(Fig.84-1).
Pathophysiology
Numerous systemic diseases will causerabbits to sit for extended periodsin a
hunched position.In some cage settings,thiswill expose the perineal andventral
skin to the urine.Rabbits with cystitis and“bladder sludge syndrome”are also
prone tourine scald.
Clinical Signs
Rabbitswithurine scaldemit afoul odor.The perinealandventral skincanbe ery-
thematous andulcerated.Palpation of thisarea can bepainfulanda mucopurulent
discharge may be present.
Lab Findings
In somecases,thecompletebloodcount andplasma biochemistryfindings arenot
affectedbythis disease.Butifa severe secondary bacterial dermatitisispresent,an
increasein thewhitebloodcell countmay beobserved.Urine scald is alwayscaused
byaprimary disease and these diseases may cause abnormalities in thebiochem-
istry panel.

DiagnosticTests
Diagnosis ismade by observing thelesions.Askin biopsy shows inflammationand,
possibly,intralesionalbacteria.
Treatment
Treatment has to include therapy for the primary disease;otherwise,urine scald
cannot becured.The severity of the skin lesion dictates how aggressive the therapy
shouldbe.Inmild cases,drying agentsand topical antibacterial preparations can
beused.Inmoreseverecases,systemicantibioticsshouldbeaddedtothetreatment
regimen.Hydrotherapy,if inflammation is severe,aidsin healing ofurine scald.
However,the owners must understand that if the primary problem is not ad-
dressed,urine scald cannotbecured.

Diagnostic Tests
Abdominal ultrasound can detect an enlargedadrenal gland in some cases.Not all
adrenal glands that are diseased are enlarged.Measurement of adrenal androgen
concentrationsis a more consistentmethodto diagnose thisdisease.In ferretswith
adrenal gland disease,one or more adrenal androgens will be elevated above the
normalrange.
Treatment
Surgical removal of the diseased adrenal gland iscurrently thepreferred treatment.
Ifboth adrenal glands are diseased,the clinician has the option of removingboth
glandsoronewholeglandandpartoftheother.Ifbothglandsareentirelyremoved
then glucocorticoid supplementation isrequired.In some ferrets,mineralcorticoid
supplementation mayalsobe needed.If onewholegland andpart of the otherisre-

FERRETS:MASTCELLTUMORS
KarenRosenthal
Definition/Overview
Cutaneous mast cell tumors are common causes of skinmasses in ferrets.This is al-
most always a benign disease in ferrets.Rarely does cutaneous mast celltumor dis-
easelead to orresult from mast cell metastasis(Fig.91-1).Ferretswith cutaneous
mastcelltumorshavenoother signsof disease.
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Cutaneousmastcell tumorshavehistopathologiccharacteristicscommon tomast
celltumors in other animals.The mastcells are well-differentiated,round tooval
in shape,and are usually arranged in sheets.Because this is usually a benign dis-
ease,mitoticfgures arerare.
Clinical Signs
Mastcell tumors appearasindividual skinnodules.Aferretcanhave oneormany
noduleson different skin areas.The mostcommon bodyarea in which to findthe
nodules is the dorsum,especiallynear the shoulders.Nodules vary in size froma
couple ofmillimeters to up to3centimeters.Although they canappear just asa
nodule,typically,themassiserythematous.Driedbloodonandaround thenodule

LabFindings
Thecompleteblood countandplasmabiochemistry findings are not affectedby cu-
taneousmastcelltumors.
Diagnostic Tests
The diagnostic test of choice is biopsy of the mast cell tumor.The ferret is tran-
quilized oranesthetized andthebiopsy specimenis taken.Animpression smear can
alsobe used to diagnose thisdisease.
Treatment
Removal of the cutaneous tumors is the treatment of choice.These tumors donot
require chemotherapy orradiation therapy.In some cases,these cutaneous tumors
havebeen seen todissipatewithout treatment.
Prognosis
The prognosis for cutaneousmast cell tumorsin ferretsisexcellent.Even without
surgery,these cutaneous tumors donot appear to metastasize.Removal isstill in
dicated though.If thenodules arepruritic,removalwillimprove thequalityof life.

Definition/Overview
Sarcoptimangeirarelysennpetrrtsarcoptesscabiwhichaffetos
andcats,is the cause of sarcopticmange in ferrets.Two syndromes are seen with
sarcoptesmites,either ageneralizedinfestation or one that islocalized to the feet
only.
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Sarcopticmange israre in ferrets and thereforehas notbeen extensively studied.In
thegeneralized form,thisislikelya secondary disease process and the existence of
a primary disease shouldbeinvestigated.
Clinical Signs
Inthelocalizedform,only thefeetshowsignsofdisease.Thefeetareswollen,ry-
thematous,and the ferret may feel pain when walking.The pads may be cracked
andbleeding.Inthe generalized form,there are patches ofalopecia andthe ferret
is intensely pruritic.The skin may beerythematous and ulcerated because of the
pruritus.
Lab Findings
Typically,thecomplete blood count andplasma biochemistry findings arenot af
fectedbythisdiseaseexceptforaneosinophilia.Ifsecondarybacterialdermatitisis
present,the white blood cell count may be slightly elevated.
517
518
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinical Companion
Diagnostic Tests
This disease is diagnosed by a skin scrape revealing either the mite or ova.It can be
difficult in chronic cases to demonstrate the mite on skin scrapes.A biopsy of the
skin may show evidence of the mites and/or severe inflammation.In the localized
form,itmaybe difficult tofind areas on the foot to scrape forevidence of mites.lt
isnot uncommon to use response to treatment as a diagnostic test for sarcoptic
mites.
Treatment
Treat sarcoptic mites with ivermectin at 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg SC once and repeat in 2
weeks.Otheranimals in the housemay need tobe treated,too.This includes other
ferrets,dogs,and cats.Also,the environment the ferret lives in should be cleaned
Ifa primary problem is present,this must be addressed before successful treatment
ofsarcopticmange can be attained.
Prognosis
The prognosis for a cure is excellent in the localized form. In the generalized form,
unless the primary problem is resolved, the prognosis is more guarded.

FERRETS:CANINE
EDISTEMPER
VIRUS
Karen Rosenthal
Definition/Overview
Canine distemper virus is fatal in ferrets.One manifestation of this disease is the
dermatologicchanges.In the scheme of things,the dermatologic signs are minor,
but these changes areimportant for diagnostic purposes.
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Caninedistemperviruscausesrespiratory,dermatologic,gastrointestinal,andnu
rologicdiseaseinferrets.Ferrets diefromtheviralinfectionorasevere,secondary
bacterial pneumonia.Inclusion bodies canbe found in alltissues post-mortem but
aremostcommonintheepitheliumofthegastrointestinal tract,bladder,andskin.
Clinical Signs
The dermatologicclinical signs of canine distemper virus are mainly observed on
thechin and footpads.Thefirst signs of this diseasearea mild upperrespiratory in-
fection including ocular and nasal discharges.In some cases,the dermatologic
changesfollow the upperrespiratory signs or the skin changescan appearfirst.A
chin rash including erythema and alopecia develops.The skin in this area then be-
comes swollen and crusty.Asthe diseaseprogresses,hyperkeratosis of thefootpads
ensues.Thefootpadsbecomehard,swollen,and crusted.Inmostcases,otherlin-
ical signs of disease accompany hyperkeratosisof the footpads,includingneuro-
logicsignsandseverelowerrespiratorydisease.
521
522
The5-MinuteVeterinary Consult Clinical Companion
Lab Findings
The completeblood countmaybe elevated,reflecting the secondarybacterial pneu
monia that accompanies canine distemper virus.Depending on the progression of
the disease at the time of venipuncture,various biochemical abnormalities will be
seen,including elevated hepatic enzymes.
Diagnostic Tests
The definitive diagnosis of canine distemper virus is usually made postmortem. In-
clusion bodies are found in epithelial cells on histopathology.History of exposure
to this virus in an unvaccinated ferret is common.Serum antibody tests and fluo-
rescentantigen tests aid in the diagnosis.Biopsy of the affected areas of the skinis
usually not practical as the ferret commonly succumbs to the disease before
histopathology results are known.Very rarely,ferrets will develop atypical canine
distemper virus infection.This usually is the result of improper vaccination proce-
dures.In these ferrets,the only sign of disease may be the dermatologic changes.
In the early stages of canine distemper virusinfection,themildupperrespiratory
signs can mimic those of the much less serious disease, influenza virus infection.
Dermatologic disease isnot part of influenza viral infections.If a ferret has a mild
upper respiratory infection accompanied by a chin rash,this is a signal that canine
distemper viral infection is a more likely diagnosis than influenza viral infection.
Treatment
There is no treatment for canine distemper virus.Antibiotics can be used to treat
the secondary bacterial infections.
Prognosis
The prognosis for this disease is very poor.

EXPECTEDCOURSEANDPROGNOSIS
·Long-term prognosis-varies,depending on the severity
·Minimal disease—prognosis good;tends to spontaneously resolve with no ev-
idence of scarring
·Mild to moderate disease-tends toeventually spontaneously resolve;usually
with residual scarring
·Severe disease—poor prognosis for long-term survival; dermatitis andmyosi-
tis are severe and life-long
ASSOCIATEDCONDITIONS
Idiopathiculcerative dermatosis of Shetland sheepdogs and collies-poorly under-
stood disease; described in adult collies and Shetland sheepdogs;characterized by
well-demarcated serpiginous ulcers in the intertriginous areas of the groin and ax
illae;may occur alone or concurrently with dermatomyositis;maybe a subgroup
of dermatomyositis
AGE-RELATED FACTORS
·Clinical signs are usually first seen in dogs <6months old.
·Adult-onset-rare;more commonly seen in dogs that had subtle lesions as
puppies; more noticeable lesions develop as a result of some precipitating
event(i.e., trauma,estrus)
PREGNANCY
· Do not breed affected dogs.
·Pregnancy exacerbates clinical symptoms.

HISTORICAL FINDINGS (PRIMARY KERATINIZATION DISORDER)
KeratinizationDisorders Are Often Secondary to aPre-existing
Underlying Disease.Thus, Obtaining a Thorough History Is of
Prime Importance
·Excessive scale generally starts at an early age in primary keratinization dis
orders.
Scaling,ollicular casts,orcomedonespresentbeforeother signs suchasru
ritus,inflammation,alopecia,and pyoderma.
·Response to prior therapy for pyoderma reveals incomplete resolution of
scale,comedones,orfollicularcasts(if treatingthepyodermaresultsincom
plete resolution of signs,then a secondary keratinization disorder is more
likely).

ings will be positive for mites in acariases.Fungal cultures will be positive in
dermatophytosis,andKOH preparations orWood’slamp examinationmay
be positive in dermatophytosis.Flea combing orresponse to flea control will
be positive in the presence of fleas or flea allergy dermatitis.Skin cytologies
will be positive forbacteria or yeast in pyoderma ormalasseziasis,respec
tively.A strict food elimination diet trial can determine the presence of food
allergy.Intradermal skin testing or invitro allergy testing alongwith clinical
signs and history can help explore the presence of atopy. Secondary kera-
tinization disorders arising in environments with lowhumidity should re
spond to treatment with topical moisturizers.Histopathology will help de-
termine if an immune-mediated or neoplastic process is present as the primary
cause ofa secondarykeratinization disorder.
·Histopathologic findings will depend on the type of primary (or secondary)
keratinization disorder present andinclude varying degrees of orthokeratotic
and/or parakeratotic hyperkeratosis,follicular hyperkeratosis,follicular di-
latation,follicular casts,dyskeratosis,epidermal hyperplasia,dystrophic
hairs,pigmentary clumping,vacuolated keratinocytes,increased mitoticac
tivity inbasal keratinocytes,and other epidermal abnormalities.
Therapeutics
·In secondary keratinization disorders,treatment of underlying causes should
resolve the keratinization disorder. In very chronic cases it may take 3 to 4
months to seecomplete resolution.Secondary pyoderma or malassezia infec-
tions need tobe treated appropriately.
·In primary keratinization disorders,the specific keratinization disorder
shouldbe addressed toput thekeratinization disorderinremission orto con-
trol it as best as possible.
·Topical therapiesare generallyused,aggressively at first,and then tapered o
an“as-needed” basis.
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDED THERAPY
Acne
·Mild cases:benign neglect
·Moderate to severe cases:benzoyl peroxide shampoos or gels or mupirocin
ointment twice daily until controlled and then as needed.Warm water or ep-
som salt soaks may be needed.
·In recurrent or deeper infections: appropriate oral antibiotics for at least 38
weeks
·Short-term corticosteroids(prednisone,prednisolone）at 1.1 mg/kg q24h PO
(dogs) and 1-2 mg/kg q24hPO (cats)are occasionally indicated to help re-
duce inflammation and scar tissue formation.
·Refractory cases: topical retinoids (tretinoin）q12h or systemic retinoids
(isotretinoin)at1-2mg/kgq24hPO
·Dogs often outgrow their acne with the onset of sexual maturity.
Disorder of Cornificationin theRottweilerSimilar to CHILD
SyndromeofHumans
·Depends on severity of case and degree of systemic involvement
·Mild cases:benign neglect,topicalantiseborrheics orkeratolytic gels;advise
against breeding
538
The 5-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion
·Moderate to severe cases: no good therapies exist.Topical therapies with sul-
fur/salicylic acid or tar or benzoylperoxide shampoosmay be of temporary
benefit.
EarMarginDermatosis
·Rarely curable
shampoos or benzoyl peroxide shampoos or benzoyl peroxide-sulfur sham-
poos)to help remove the accumulated scale and debris
·More advancedcasesmay require topical glucocorticoid creams or ointments
or if severe inflammation is present,a short course of oral glucocorticoids(1
mg/kgq24hPO)isindicated.Otheroptions include pentoxifylline(Trental),
topical retinoids,EFAs,etc.
·Severe or extensive fissures may require pinnal surgery.
EpidermalDysplasiaofWestHighlandWhiteTerriers
·Often refractory to medical therapy
·In cases with secondary malassezia dermatitis,significant improvement may
be noted with a 3-4week course of oral ketoconazole at 10 mg/kg q24h PO
and1-3 times perweekbaths withketoconazole ormiconazole shampoos or
enilconazole rinses.The disease is kept controlled with topical baths or rinses
and/or daily or alternate-day oralketoconazole.A50/50white vinegar and
water rinse1 to 2 timesweekly mayprolongthe intervalbetween recurrences
of the disease.
·Early cases may benefit from immunosuppressive doses of prednisone or
prednisolone at 1.1-2.2 mg/kg q12h PO until in remission and then tapered
to an every-other-day dosage for long-term management.
FootpadHyperkeratosis
·Daily 50% propylene glycol soaks until improvement is noted (usually within
5 days),then taper to as needed
·Retinoids are postulated to help.
Ichthyosis
·Not curable; lifelong therapy is needed
·Topical therapies includingwarm water soaks and antiseborrheic shampoos,
esp. sulfur salicylic shampoos,antiseborrheic gels (esp.KeraSolv),topical
retinoids,andhumectant oremollient sprays orrinse(esp.with lactic acid or
propylene glycol),are used initially aggressively and frequently and thenta
pered to an“as-needed” basis.
·Good to excellent results are usually seen with systemic retinoids. Isotretinoin
at 1-2mg/kgq24hPOor soriataneat1-2mg/kgq24hPOmaybeused.Re
mission may take up to 3months.Some dogs may be tapered to an alternate-
day therapeutic regime.
IdiopathicSeborrhea
·Therapeutic goal is to identify best means of control with lifelong therapy
·Topical therapy with antiseborrheic shampoos based on type of seborrhea
·When presented with dry scale:moisturizing,hypoallergenic shampoos and
rinses should be used.If dry scale is severe, sulfur/salicylic acid shampoos and
moisturizing rinses should be used.

·Calcinosis cutis-changes characteristic of hyperglucocorticoidism (e.g,
stressleukogram,highALP,hyperglycemia,lowurine specificgravity)
Cutaneous xanthomasmay be glucosuria,hyperglycemia,and/orlipid pro
file abnormalities
Radiology and ultrasonography—delineate involvement of internal organs in
amyloidosis and histiocytosis
·Radiology-identify other areas of dystrophic calcification in dogs with cal-
cinosis cutis
●Ultrasonography—-identify cystadenocarcinomas in dogs with nodular der-
matofibrosis
Skin biopsies forhistopathology and cultures(fungal,aerobic,and mycobac
terial) are essential for nodular dermatoses.
Therapeutics
·Most of these disorders can be treated on an outpatient basis.
·A few of these disorders (e.g.,malignant histiocytosis,amyloidosis,and
nodular dermatofibrosis) are almost always fatal.
Dogs with calcinosis cutis may need to be hospitalized for sepsis and intense
topical therapy.
DRUGS
Amyloidosisno known therapy,unless the lesion is solitary and can be sur-
gicallyremoved
Spherulocytosis--only effective treatment is surgical removal
Idiopathic sterilegranuloma and pyogranuloma-prednisone (2.2-4.4 mg/kg
divided PO q12h) is thefirst line of therapy;continue steroids for 7-14 days
after complete remission;then taper dose;for cases that are refractory to glu-
cocorticoids,azathioprine (2.2mg/kg PO q48h) in combination with pred-
nisone or sodium iodidemaybetried.
·Foreign bodyreactions--best treated by removal of the offending substance
ifpossible;forhairforeignbodies,thedogshouldbeplacedonsofterbedding
and topical therapy with keratolytic agents should be initiated;many dogs
with hair foreignbodies also have secondary deep bacterial infections that
need tobe treatedwithboth topical and systemic antibiotics
·Canine eosinophilic granuloma—prednisone(1.1-2.2mg/kg PO q24h) pro-
duces a good response
·Malignant histiocytosisno effective therapy; it is rapidly fatal
Cutaneous histiocytosishigh-dose glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs re-
sult in remission; recurrences are common; L-asparginase has been helpful in
some cases
·Calcinosis cutis-underlying disease must be controlled if possible;most
cases require antibiotics to control secondary bacterialinfections;hydrother-
apy and frequentbathingin antibacterial shampoos minimize secondary
problems;topical DMSO is useful(applied to nomore than one-third of the
body once daily until lesions resolve);if lesions are extensive,serum calcium
levelsshouldbemonitored closely
Calcinosis circumscriptasurgical excision is the therapy of choice in most
cases
·Sterile panniculitissinglelesions can be removed surgically; prednisone(2.2
mg/kgPOq24hor dividedPO q12h)is the treatment of choice;administered

The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsult Clinical Companion
until lesions regress;then tapered;some dogs remain in long-term remission,
but others require prolonged alternate-day therapy:a few cases respond to
oralvitaminE (400IUq12h)
·Nodular dermatofibrosisno therapy formost cases,because the cystadeno
carcinomas are usually bilateral; for rare unilateral case of cystadenocarci-
noma or a cystadenoma,removalof the single affected kidneymay be helpful
·Cutaneous xanthoma-correction of the underlying diabetes mellitus or hy-
perlipoproteinemia isusually curative
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Corticosteroids and otherimmunosuppressive drugs shouldbeavoided,if possible,
in any animal with a secondary infection.
PRECAUTIONS
DMSO—handlewith care;monitor serum calcium levelsif used to treat calcinosis
cutis.
Comments
PATIENT MONITORING
·Patients on long-term glucocorticoids should have a CBC,chemistry screen,
urinalysis,and urine culture done every 6 months.
·Dogs being treated with DMSO for calcinosis cutis should have calcium lev
els checked every 7-14 days, starting at the beginning of therapy.
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS

JonD.PlantandKarenHeltonRhodes
Definition/Overview
·Group of hereditary diseases characterized by abnormal skin hyperextensi-
bility and fragility
·Also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and dermatosparaxis
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Abnormal collagen synthesis or fiber formation isresponsible for the skin
fragilityin most syndromes;however,the biochemical defects have been elu-
cidated in only a few dogs andcats.
Varying modes of inheritance have been suspected.

LYMPHEDEMA
Francis W.K.Smith,Jr
Definition/Overview
·Abnormal accumulation ofprotein-rich lymph fluid into interstitial spaces,
especially subcutaneousfat
·Chroniclymphedema causes tissuefibrosis.
·Maybe congenital or acquired
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Hereditary/congenitalmalformation of the lymphatic system-aplasia,
valvularincompetence,andlymphnodefibrosis
Excessive interstitial fluid production secondary to venous hypertension(as-
sociatedwithcongestive heartfailure andobstruction ofvenous drainage)or
increasedvascularpermeability(associatedwith infection,trauma,heat,and
irradiation)
·Secondary damage to lymphatic vessels or lymphnodes-associated with
trauma,infection,and neoplasia

DRUGS
·Benzopyrones reduce high-protein edema by stimulating macrophages to re-
lease proteases; beneficial effects recorded in experimental studies in dogs.
Rutin,50 mg/kg PO q8h,may benefit.A recent study in humans showed
combined usage of oral and topical benzopyrones to be more effective than
either alone.
·Diuretics,steroids,anticoagulants,and fibrinolytic agents have been used,
but no confirmed benefit
CONTRAINDICATIONS/POSSIBLEINTERACTIONS
Diureticsinitiallyreduce swellingbut increase protein content of interstitial fluid,
resulting in further tissue damage and fibrosis
Comments
·Puppies with severe lymphedema may die.

Paul W. Snyder
Definition/Overview
·Diminished ability to mount an effective immuneresponse
·Caused by heritable defects in the immune system (secondary disease-di-
minishedimmuneresponse acquiredasaconsequenceof some otherprimary
disease)
Etiology/Pathophysiology
The identification of a specific defect in theimmune responserequires an ad
equate understanding of the cellular and genetic basis of the immune system.
The types and causes are diverse;defects in the cell-mediated,humoral,com-
plement,andphagocytic systems have all been described in theveterinary lit
erature.

MEAN AGE AND RANGE
Primary immunodeficiency diseases typically expressed in the first year of life
PREDOMINANT SEX
X-linkedrecessive severe combined immunodeficiency disease ofBassett hounds-
males affected and females carriersfor the defect
Clinical Features
·Depend on the level at which the immune response is defective;range from
chronic respiratory and gastrointestinal signs and skin infections tolife-
threatening conditions

trointestinal systems
·Lesions of septicemia common in animals with severe defects
·T-lymphocyte defects-hypoplastic or dysplastic lesions of the thymus and
T-lymphocyte-dependent areas of secondary lymphoid tissues
·B-lymphocyte defects--hypoplastic or dysplasticlesions of the bone marrow
orB-lymphocyte-dependentareasof secondarylymphoid tissues
·Lymphoid hypoplasia or hyperplasia may be seen,depending on the overall
defect and the occurrence of infection.
Therapeutics
·Hospitalization may be necessary to control life-threatening infection.
·Outpatient management possible for some patients
·Dietary management maybe required to ensure that the patient ismaintained
at an adequate level of nutrition.
·Potential sources of infectious agents such as raw meat must be avoided.
DRUGS
·Antibiotics to control infections
·-Globulin or plasma preparations can be used in conjunction with antibi-
Otics to control infection in patients with humoral defect.
·Symptomatic treatment forsecondary diseasestates
ImmunodeficiencyDisorders,Primary
585
CONTRAINDICATIONS
-Globulin or plasma preparations should not be administered to patients with se
lectiveIgA deficiency,because many affectedpatients havehigh concentrations of
anti-IgA antibodies andmay developan anaphylactic reaction.
PRECAUTIONS
Modified livevirus vaccines should notbeadministered to patients withsuspected
T-lymphocyte deficiencies,because it may induce disease in these patients.
CLIENT EDUCATION
·Inform client that the animal cannot be cured.
·Discuss why the patient has high susceptibility to infection.
·Discuss and advise as to the heritability of the disease.
·Discuss the possibility of other littermates being affected.
·Avoid exposure to illanimals.
PATIENT MONITORING
·For clinical signs of secondary infection
·Routine physical examination to assess efficacy of antibiotic therapy in con
trol of secondary infection
PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE
·Affected animals should not bebred.
·Pedigree analysis to determine themode ofinheritance andpreventpropa
gating the defect
EXPECTED COURSEAND PROGNOSIS
·The severity of the defect determines the course of disease and prognosis.
·Patients with minor defects can be successfully managed.

Although veterinary products tend to provide excellent results,their costsmay be
prohibitive.The use of Johnson's Baby Shampoo,Palmolive,Ivory,or Mycodex
shampoo for the removal of surface dirtmay decrease costs and augment the effi-
cacy of more expensive medicated shampoos.
Antiseborrheic Shampoos
Visible scalemayresult from abnormal cell migration,increasedmitotic activityin
the stratum basale,biochemical anomalies inkeratin production,and aberrations
in intercellular lipidproduction.Antiseborrheic shampoos are primarily directed at
eliminating surface scale(keratolysis）and normalizing epidermal cell kinetics (ker-
atoplasty).Conditions thatare amenable to these shampoos include zincresponsive
dermatosis,pemphigusfoliaceus,earmargin dermatosis,and hypothyroidism.
SULFURANDSALICYLICACID
Properties of sulfur include:
·keratoplastic
cytostatic orrelatedto the formation of cystine which
is an important constituent of the stratum corneum,
thus normalizingkeratinization.
·keratolytic
primarily due to the formation of hydrogen sulfide and
·antifungal
pentathionic acid from the combination of sulfur with
·antibacterial
cysteine.
·antiparasitic
·antipruritic
Properties of salicylic acid include:
·keratoplastic
·keratolytic
decreases pH resulting in increased hydration of ker-
atin and thus swelling of cells in the stratum corneum.
As well,it solubilizes intercellular cement substance
promoting the desquamation of attached surfacecells.
·antipruritic
·bacteriostatic
A synergistickeratolytic effect is observedwhen sulfur and salicylic acid are incor-
porated in equal proportions.Examples of these shampoosinclude:
·SebaMoist(EVSCO)
—contains 2% sulfur,2% salicylic acid
-—-incorporates Novasome rehydrating technology
·Sebolux(Allerderm)

BENZOYL PEROXIDE
Benzoyl peroxide is included with antiseborrheic agents but also has superior an-
timicrobial activity.It is often formulated at 2.5% to3% in veterinary products
owing to its irritating effects at higherconcentrations.Also,the excellent drying ac-
tivity of benzoyl peroxide shampoos often necessitates the use of emollients or al-
ternating treatments with a milder product. Cases in which benzoyl peroxides are
of value include greasy pets with secondary bacterial dermatoses, dogs with de-
modicosis,cases of chin acne,and schnauzer comedo syndrome.Owners should be
warned of the potential for bleaching fabrics and hair coats.
Properties of benzoyl peroxide:
·keratlytic
·antibacterial
·follicular flushing
·degreasing
This,alongwithtar-basedshampoos,shouldbedispensedbyprescriptionON,
and shouldbepurchasedfromreputable suppliers as thebottledesignisimportant

lODINE
Iodine preparations have decreased in popularity as a result of their unwanted
properties and the development of more efficient products.Iodine has good activ-
ity against bacteria,viruses,fungi,and sporeformers,especiallywhencombined
with pyrrolidone nitrogen.Residual activity lasts 6-8hours and may cause irrita
tion and staining.
·IodineShampoo(EVSCO)

IMIDAZOLES
Imidazoles actby interfering with ergosterol synthesis of fungal andyeast organ-
isms,therebyinreasingcellularpermeability,suppressingmetabolicfunction,an
inhibiting growth.There has also been evidence that ketoconazole exerts an an-
tiproliferative effect on keratinocytes in culture.These shampoos are of value when
trying to address dermatophyte orMalassezia infections.

ETHYL LACTATE
Ethyl lactate has excellent antibacterial activity in a nondrying,degreasing shampoo
formulatedata 10%concentration,called Etiderm(Allerderm).My use for this prod-
uct has been limited to the Xoloitzcuintle breed (the Mexican Hairless), although
many colleagues have used it with favorable results.I find the shampoo extremely wa-
tery with a distinct odor,and it doesn't seem to lather as well as other shampoos.
There have alsobeen reported cases in which the shampoo seems tobe irritating.
Topical Antipruritics
Topical antipruritic therapy is gaining increasing interestin particular when try-
ingto control itch prior to an intradermal allergy test.Idealwithdrawal times for
anti-inflammatorymedicationbefore testingare asfollows:
ShampooTherapy
591
·corticosteroid injections: 8-12weeks
·corticosteroid tablets:
4-6 weeks
·topical corticosteroids:
2 weeks
·oralantihistamines:
2weeks
Thus,a 2-week interval remains in which other means of abating pruritus must
be implemented. Oatmeal-based shampoos act by ADsorbing surface allergens and
pruritic mediators to the ultra-fine colloidal oatmeal particles,which are then gen-
tly rinsed away.Several products are available.
·Dermal-Soothe(EVSCO)—2%oatmeal-based shampoo and conditioner
—also contains 1% pramoxine HCl, a local
anesthetic
·Episoothe(Allerderm)
-2%oatmeal-basedshampooandconditioner
·Relief (DVM)
-2%oatmeal-based shampoo,20%oatmeal-
based conditioner
-also contains 1% pramoxine HCl,a local
anesthetic
The luxury of these formulations is that they do not have tobewithdrawn prior to
the IDAT.A powdered oatmeal formulation to be added toa cool bath is also avail-
ableasEPISOOTHEandAVEENO.
Other Anti-Inflammatory Shampoos
Shampoos containing 2% diphenhydramine or1%hydrocortisone,omega-6 fatty
acidsand 2%colloidaloatmeal (Histacalmand CortiCalm by Allerderm)and
0.01%fluocinolone acetonide with 8%colloidal oatmeal (FS ShampoobyMerid-
ianVeterinaryProducts)are also available.Only anecdotalreports concerning the
shampoos are available.The shampoos have not proven tobe as effective asI had
hoped.Owingto theirpotentialinterferencewithintradermalallergytesting,I have
used the pramoxine HCl base products with greater frequency.With any of the
above shampoos,contact time is cruciali.e.,2-10 minutes.
Final Comments
When selecting a shampoo,baseyour decision on the active ingredients within a
product,and then consider the company's quality control measures(development,
stability trials,adherence to FDA requirements).With the advent of alternative
medicine,many fly-by-night companies are producing shampoos whose formula-
tions are not consistent with what is in the bottle,nor have they undergone any
rigid testing before they reach the market.

FINDINGS
Above-Normal Response
·Other testsused to screen for Cushing's syndrome include urinary cortisol:crea-
tinine ratio (UCCR)and a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST).
·If anACTH stimulation test indicates Cushing's syndrome but the diagnosis
is questionable（e.g.,nonadrenalillness orresults borderline),the diagnosisis
best confirmed with the LDDST,which is more sensitive than the ACTH re-
sponse; if the LDDST is normal, consider another diagnosis.
·If the ACTH response is normal but suspicion of Cushing's syndrome re
mains high,an LDDST can be performed;a positive LDDST but normal
positive LDDST result.
·If the ACTH response is above normal and a diagnosis of Cushing's syn-
dromeislikely onthebasisofhistoricalandclinicalfindings,performa high
dose dexamethasone suppression test ormeasure endogenous ACTH con-
centrations to differentiatebetween PDH and AT.
Below-Normal Response
·Measuring endogenous ACTH concentration and/or serum aldosterone con-
centrations pre-and post-ACTH injection can differentiate spontaneous pri-
mary and secondary Addison's disease.
·Measuring serum aldosterone concentrations canassess mineralocorticoid se

Above-Normal Response
·Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography can be used to differentiate
PDH from AT.
·Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) can re-

Definition/Overview
·Toperform anLDDST,administer dexamethasone(0.01-0.015mg/kgIVfor
dogs and 0.1mg/kgfor cats).
·Can usedexamethasone ordexamethasonesodiumphosphate aslong ascal-
culations arebased on theconcentration of theactive ingredient
·Drawbloodbeforeand4and8hr afterinjection.
·Atbaseline(i.e.,pre-dexamethasone),normalplasma cortisol concentrations
indogsare10-160nmol/L（~0.4-6.0μg/dL)and in cats,10-110nmol/L
(~0.44.0μg/dL).
·Anormalanimalhas a cortisolconcentrationbelow~30nmol/L(1.0μg/dL)
at both 4and8hr post-dexamethasone.(Note:normalvaluesvary slightly
between laboratories.)
·Dexamethasone should be diluted in sterile saline ifnecessary for cats and
small dogs,so thatthepatient is dosedaccurately.
·Ifpart or allof the dexamethasone isgiven out of thevein,thetest shouldbe
stopped and attemptedagain after at least 48hr.
Etiology/Pathophysiology
Used to screen for hyperadrenocorticism(Cushing’s syndrome);lack of sup-
pression inresponsetoa lowdose of dexamethasone isconsistentwith a di-
agnosis of hyperadrenocorticismbut canbea nonspecificfinding in dogswith
nonadrenal illness.

Cushing's syndrome can be caused either by an ACTH-secreting pituitary tu-
mor (i.e.,pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism,PDH) or by a cortisol-
secreting AT.
·Normally,dexamethasone feeds back onto the pituitary and turns off ACTH
secretion;when systemicACTH concentration falls,the secretory stimulus to
the adrenal cortex diminishes,andcortisolrelease decreases;thus,4and8hr
after dexamethasone,plasma cortisol concentration islow(<30nmol/L).
WithPDH,the pituitary tumor is relatively resistant to feedback,and secre-
tion ofACTHand,in turn,cortisol continues.
·Because of the continued autonomous secretion of cortisol from anAT,en-
dogenous ACTH is already suppressed,administration of an exogenous glu-
cocorticoid hasnofurthereffectonthepituitary,andautonomouscortisolse-
cretion continues despite dexamethasone administration.
·A diagnosis of either PDH or AT is supported by a 4- and/or 8-hr post-
dexamethasoneplasma cortisol concentration>30nmol/L;in addition,if the
4-hrpost-dexamethasone concentration is<30 nmol/Lbut the 8-hr sample is
>30 nmol/L or if one orboth are less than50%of baseline,PDH is likely;
however,if both post-dexamethasone concentrations are>30nmol/L and nei
ther of these values is less than 50% of baseline,eitherPDH orATis possible.
·A lack of suppression in dogs during an LDDST can alsobe an effect of non
adrenal illness and associated nonspecific activation of the hypothalamic-pi-
tuitary-adrenal axis; the effect of nonadrenal illness on the LDDST in cats is
unknown.
·A false-negative test result is seen in ~5%of patients with Cushing's syn-
drome; this may be owing to early PDH in which the tumor still responds to
glucocorticoidfeedback.
Differential Diagnosis
·Historical findings ofhyperadrenocorticism include polyuria/polydipsia,bi-
laterally symmetricalalopecia orfailure toregrowhair,abdominalenlarge-
ment,olyhagia,besity,anting,lethargy,muscleweaknessanestrus,an
heat intolerance.
Physicalexaminationfindingsof hyperadrenocorticism include thin skin,ab
dominal enlargement,bilaterally symmetrical alopecia,hepatomegaly,pyo
derma,seborrhea,cutaneoushyperpigmentation,musclewastingofextremi
ties, calcinosis cutis,bruising, and testicular atrophy.
·Historical and physical examination findings vary,depending on the nona-
drenal illness present.
Laboratory Findings
DRUGS THATMAY ALTERLABORATORY RESULTS
·Phenobarbital administration may cause lack of suppression.
·Prednisone,prednisolone,and hydrocortisone cross-react inmany cortisolra
dioimmunoassays and cause an artifactual increase inmeasured cortisol con-
centration; suppression in response to dexamethasone may be obscured.
·Prolonged glucocorticoid therapy may affect the pituitary-adrenal axis by
continuously activating normal negative feedback mechanisms.
·The LDDST is unreliable in these patients because it may not cause adequate
suppression,leading toa false-positive testresult.

bloodpressuremaybemildly levatedbut neitherare specificfindings.
·A skinbiopsy can confirm the diagnosis of calcinosis cutis,a pathognomonic
finding for hyperadrenocorticism; other skin biopsy changes maybe sugges
tive of an endocrinopathy but are not specific.
·A liver biopsy can show changes consistent with steroid hepatopathy,a sen
sitive but nonspecificmarker of Cushing's syndrome.
Treatment
Lack of suppression itself does not need to be treated.
·If the testresult is owing to nonadrenalillness,therapy should be directed to-
ward resolution of that disease.
·If Cushing's syndrome is believed to be present,therapy is directed toward
management of hyperadrenocorticism;unless a complication of Cushing's
syndrome is present that requires hospitalization (e.g.,pulmonary throm-
boembolism),patients can be treated as outpatients.
Comments
PATIENT MONITORING
·If hyperadrenocorticism is present,follow-up is done depending on the type
of therapy chosen (see Hyperadrenocorticism).
·If nonadrenal illness is present and believed possibly tobe the cause of the ab
normal UCCRresults,the illness should be treated; once the animalis stable.
the UCCR should be repeated oranACTH response test should be performed
after 4-8weeks.
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Untreated hyperadrenocorticism can lead to development of all classic signsif not
already present (e.g,polyuria,polydipsia,panting,polyphagia)as well as life-

AGE-RELATED FACTORS
·Nonadrenal illness can occur in an animal of any age.
Hyperadrenocorticism is typically a disease of middle-aged to older cats and
dogs,although it has been reported in dogs 1 year old.

STAPHYLOCCALBLEPHARITIS:ANOTHERMANIFESTATIONOF
ALLERGICDERMATITIS
Karen Helton Rhodes,DVM,Dip.ACVD
IleneKatz,Dermatology Technician
Many canine patients with allergy are extremely pruritic in the periocular region. In
some of these cases we may only see erythema or conjunctivitis,which readily respond
to antinflammatory ophthalmics.A small subset of these dogs will present with marked
erythema, swelling/induration,and a papular eruption along the lid margins.These
cases may have a primary staphylococcal blepharitis OR the infection and hypersensi
tivity may be secondary to allergic dermatitis.Some of these cases are so severe they may
mimic autoimmune disorders.A biopsy of the periocular tissue will confirm the diag-
nosis.
THERAPY:
1.Eyelid scrubs: 1 drop of baby shampoo mixed in a cup of warm water;
gently “scrub" the periocular and lid region with a wash cloth; often
recommended as a twice-weekly protocol
2.Ophthalmicointment:erythromycin ophthalmic(ocular&periocular)tid
for 7-10 days
3.Cephalexin @ 10 mg/#PO tid for 21 days
4.
After the initial 10 days of antibacterial ophthalmic ointment,I often
recommend anantinflammatory ointment(such as
neomycin/polymyxin/dexamethasone) as a preventative to be used twice
weekly during the allergy season; this step maybe avoided if the case
appears to be primary staphylococcal blepharitis rather than secondary to
allergicdermatitis

CANINEALLERGY:INTRADERMALSKINTESTINGPREPARATION
KarenHeltonRhodes,DVM,Dip.ACVD
Canine allergy is a common and frustrating problem in veterinary practice.A wide va
riety ofreedssuffer fromallergicdermatitisandotitis.Theusualyetnotexclusiveage
of onset isbetween 2and 6years of age.Pure bred dogs willoften exhibit clinical signs
at an earlier age.
Many antipruritic medications are either ineffective orinappropriate forthe individual
patient.Intradermal skin testing (IDST) is a readily available option for the client.This
procedure(IDST)is still considered by veterinary dermatologists tobe the“gold stan
dard” for evaluating allergic dermatitis in the dog and cat.Serum testing still has many
drawbacks in the veterinary patient that have not yet been overcome.The decision to
pursue allergy testing should be carefully considered by the client and the veterinarian
since the hyposensitization process requires a year-long commitment.The vaccine pro-
tocol requires frequent subcutaneous injections,withanaverage response notedwithin
6-12 months after initiation.
Preparation for the procedure is quite simple.Certain medications can interfere with the
test results and should be withdrawn prior to the test date (see the chartbelowfor guide-
lines).The procedure generally requires that the pet stay at the hospital for most of the
day. Clients may elect to “drop off” their pet for the day and return at a later time (af-
ter work,etc.).We willtry to accommodate the owner and make the procedure as con-
venient as possible.I will examine the pet and discuss all of the details of the procedure
and thehyposensitizationprocess with the owners.
Please feel free to call with any questionsyou mayhave regardingthe procedure.

1.Keep the vaccine refrigerated.
2.Syringes and needles are disposable and should only be used once. Please bring the
used syringes and needles to us or your referring veterinarian for safe disposal as
medicalwaste.
3.Insert the needle underneath the skin over the neck, shoulder,or back area. Once
in position,push the plunger and release the contents under the skin.Pull the
needle out of the skin and discard.Varyyour injection sites to avoid pain.
HOWALLERGENEXTRACTSWORK:
1.Hyposensitization (allergy vaccine) is an attempt to induce immunologic tolerance
to allergens that currently cause allergic symptoms.
2. The rate at which an animal may respond to allergy vaccine is varied and the
animal may take up to 6 months or even a year to build up enough“protective”
antibodiesto eliminate the allergicsymptoms.
3.Hyposensitization is not a “cure” for allergies. Maintenance injections must be
continued for the life of the pet.The interval between injections will vary with each
animal but is generally given on a monthly basis once a good clinical response is
achieved.DONOTSTOPTHEVACCINEUNLESSYOUANDYOUR

HOUSE DUST MITE:CONTROLLING EXPOSURE
Karen HeltonRhodes,DVM,Dip.ACVD
DERMATOLOGYCONSULTATIONS
House dust mites are microscopic and ubiquitous.They feed on human and animal dan
der,skin scale,and hair.They are frequentlyfound inbeds,matressescarpets,sofas,
andpetbedding.Mites can flourishin thehome environment because the temperature
and humidity are optimum (50-70% relative humidity).
Hypersensitivity to house dust mites is a common problem for both animals and hu-
mans.
It is difficult and even impossible to eliminate mites from the environment of an allergic
patient.An effective environmental control regimen can help to decrease the numbers
ofmites and therefore minimize the patient's discomfort.Also,hyposensitization ther
apy (allergy vaccines) can be effective in controlling or reducing the clinical symptoms
associated with mite allergy.
The following steps may help control mite populations (special attention should be
given to the sleeping areas of the allergic pet):
1.Avoid theuse of carpeting.Bare loors,suchashardwoodvinyl,or tile arebestif
carpetmustbeused,lowpileispreferable
2.Removeupholstered furniture,books,records,pilesofnewspapers andmagazines,
stuffed animals,wall hangings,and other “dust collectors” from the room.
3.Use only synthetic material in the pet‘s bedding.Feathers,wool,or horsehair stuff
ingshouldbe avoided.Remember,cedar shavings are often asource of allergic
dermatitisin the dog.
4. Wash all bedding frequently in hot water.
5.If your pet sleeps on the bed,encase mattresses and box springs in airtight plastic
and seal zippers on these casings with tape. Use washable blankets and mattress
pads.The most dust-free type of bed is a waterbed.
6.Plants can also be “dust collectors”and should be removed.
7.Change the furnace and air conditioning filters frequently.Electrostatic filters may
be more effective in filtering out dust,mites, and inhalant particles.No specific re
search has been performed on these filters and their performance in controlling
clinical signs of allergy in the dog.
8.Use air conditioning to control the temperature during warm months.Central air
conditioningispreferred,butwindowunits are alsohelpful.Try tomaintainthe
humidity levels between 30 and50%.Dehumidifiers may prove beneficial.
9.Vacuum floors,wet mop,and dust with a damp cloth daily.The room should be
properly aired after vacuuming.
10.Groom animal frequently,preferablyoutside of thehouse environment.

CONTACT DERMATITIS
KarenHeltonRhodes,DVM,Dip.ACVD
DERMATOLOGYCONSULTATIONS
Contacthypersensitivity is theresult of sensitization to an environmental allergenwith
subsequent reaction upon contact.It is classically a delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity,
which maybe the result of sensitization to any number of substances.Sensitization of-
tenresults from introduction ofnewmaterials into the animals'environment;however,
cases of hypersensitivity after previously uneventful contact with a substance for peri-
ods of time(months to years)are also reported.Fabrics and chemicals are probably the
most common offending agents.Leafy plants used for ground cover have also been in-
criminated.Very thorough investigation is often necessary to determine thematerialre-
sponsible for the hypersensitivity.Patch testing,as is used in humans,has been used in
dogs but the results have been equivocal. Isolation from suspect substances with subse-
quent challenge is the best method to detect an offending agent.

KarenHeltonRhodes,DVM,Dip.ACVD
DERMATOLOGYCONSULTATIONS
Aspecific shampoo therapy hasbeen selected foryourpet.This shampoo is medicated
and the instructionsmust be followed closely if your pet is toreceive the fullbenefit of
the treatment.Most shampoos and topical rinses are to be used as an adjunct to other
forms of therapy(oral medication,hyposensitization,etc.).Often,shampoo therapy is
recommended as amaintenanceprotocol to guard againstrelapse of the dermatologic
condition and to prolong the health of the skin.
Stepstofollow:
1.The air temperature in the bathing area should be warm; the water temperature
should be lukewarm,unless otherwise specified.Wet the coat thoroughly.
2.Pay particular attention to the affected areas of your pet's skin.Apply sufficient
shampoo to these affected areas and rub in well. Then proceed tolather the rest of
yourpet's haircoat.Some shampooswill latherbetter than otherswill,although the
active ingredients may be equally effective.
3.Allow the shampoo to remain on the coat for 15-20minutes. Contact time with the
shampoo is very important.For best results,use a timer.If bathing in the backyard,
you may allow the dog to run free while soapy for the required 15-20 minutes.
4.Rinsing is asimportant as shampooing.Unrinsed shampoomay causeirritation to the
skin.
5.Applyamedicatedconditioner orrinse to the skinandcoat,if indicated.Lightlyrinse
the coat after application.
6.Towel dry.You may use a blow dryer,but be sure that the temperature is warm,not
hot.

MALASSEZIADERMATITIS(YEAST):
KarenHeltonRhodes,DVM,Dip.ACVD
IleneKatz,DermatologyTechnician
Malassezia pachydermatis isa saprophytic yeast that iscommonly found onbothnor-
mal and abnormal skin.It is often difficult to ascertain if the yeast organisms are a pri-
mary contributor (yeast hypersensitivity) to the clinical lesions present or if they func-
tion as merely secondary invaders （underlying etiology; allergic dermatitis,etc.）of
compromised skin. Clinical lesions most commonly associatedwith malassezia der-
matitis include:erythema,scaling dermatitis(yellow-gray),greasysurface,crusting,and
malodorous.The animal is extremely pruritic(itchy)and uncomfortable.Many of these
cases have been poorly responsive to common therapeutics used to control pruritus.
Approximately 50% of affected animals have an underlying cause, which must be ex-
plored.
Specific and accurate diagnosis of malassezia dermatitis is often difficult andmay rely
heavily on clinical evaluation of the cutaneous lesions.Treatment involves a combina-
tion of oral (ketoconazole or itraconazole）and topical (ketoconazole shampoo, sele-
nium sulfide,or“malaseb” shampoo)anti-fungal medications.Many of these cases re
quire chronicmaintenance shampoo therapy tomaintain the yeastpopulationat an
acceptable and nonclinical level.
Notes:
A complete metabolic diagnostic work-up is recommended to eliminate the possibility
ofunderlying disease acting as a contributory factor.A cutaneousbiopsy and surgically
obtained culture are sometimes helpful incharacterizing this disease.
Systemic antibiotic therapy is often necessary for aminimum of 6-8weeks.Shampoo ther-
apy with a benzoyl peroxide or chlorhexidine product should be used in conjunction with
Oral therapy.Often,thehairmustbe shaved toprevent theformation ofasealingcrustand

whirlpool) with an antiseptic is beneficial in the early stages of therapy toallowfor removal

discomfort.
PODODERMATITIS:
Pododermatitis is a form of deep pyoderma that affects the interdigital areas of the
paws. Often in cases of deep pyoderma, this will be the last area to respond to therapy.
A complete diagnostic work-up is necessary to rule out causes other than bacterial (i.e.,
demodicosis,malassezia,etc.).Oralantibiotics for an extendedperiod (6-8weeks) in
ment from the owner because of theextensive protocol involved:
Step1.Shampoo thefeetwith abenzoyl peroxide or chlorhexidine product.Allow the
fet to soak in the shampoo for at least 15-20 minutes.Initial protocoldaily,
and then the interval can belengthened.
Step 2.Dry the feet and apply an astringent liberally to the area (i.e., domboros.Let air

Step 3.Apply a topical ointment or gel (mupirocin ointment or benzoyl peroxide gel).
Use a tid regiment in the initial stages,and then the frequencymay be tapered.

CANINEDEMODICOSIS
Karen Helton Rhodes,DVM,Dip.ACVD
Ilene Katz,Dermatology Technician
Canine demodicosisisaninflammatory parasiticdisease characterizedby the presence of
greater than normal numbers of demodex canis mites inthe hairfollicles and on the skin.
The reason for this proliferation is poorly understood but a genetic defect in theT-cell por-
tion of the immune system is suspected.
There are two forms of demodicosis: 1) localized and 2) generalized.The localized form is
characterizedby small focalregional lesions.The lesions associatedwithlocalized demodico
sisare typically focal mild erythemawith partial alopeciaandvariable amounts of scale.The
most frequently affected sites of lesions in this form are the periocular and perioral regions,
with the forelegs and the trunk as the second most common site. Most of the localized de-
modicosis cases are benign and regress spontaneously; however, approximately 10% of cases
will progress to thegeneralized form.The generalized form maybe divided into juvenile(dogs
less than 1year of age),adult onset,andpododemodicosis.Generalized demodicosis can be
quitesevereandthionsluryhmaalpiarustalandexudationruit
variablypresent.Some dogsmayhave pododemodicosis only,without involvement ofother
sites.Secondary pyoderma is a consistent feature ingeneralized demodicosis.
LOCALIZEDDEMODICOSISTHERAPY
Treatment of localized demodicosis is not always necessary as the majority of cases will
spontaneously cure.Treatment willnot preventprogression to the generalized form.
The general health status of the patient should be evaluatedi.e., intestinal parasitism,
diet,etc.—to ensure that underlyingabnormalities donotcontribute to the animal's pre-
disposition to demodicosis.Topical therapy for localized cases include Goodwinol oint-
ment orbenzoylperoxidegel.
GENERALIZEDDEMODICOSISTHERAPY
Therapy for generalized demodicosis requires dedication and time and may be expen-
sive for the owner.In many cases,only control of the disease may be established rather
than a complete cure.The following steps are recommended for the treatment of gener-
alized demodicosis:
1.Shave the dog (long-haired pets)if the skin is markedly crusted and exudative.
2.Gently remove all heavy crusts from the skin.
3.Protect the eyes with opthalmic ointment.
4.Shampoo the dogwith abenzoylperoxide shampoo and/orsoak in awhirlpoolbath
with an antiseptic solution.
5.Towel dry.
6.Repeat on a weekly or twice-weekly basis.
7.Systemic antibiotics should be given for an extendedperiod of time
TXOPTIONA
8.Apply Amitraz(mitaban) solution at a concentration of 5 ml/gallon water (12.5%,250
ppm) on a weekly basis—do not rinse off—let air dry (may require 6-8 weeks of therapy)
Remember**Amitraz should be applied in a well-ventilated area.Gloves should be
worn to prevent the possibility of contact hypersensitivity.Side effects ofamitraz
commonlynoted include sedation for1224hours,pruritus,andpolydipsia/polyuria.
9.Re-check every 3-4weeks to evaluate mite status.

BIOPSYTECHNIQUE
One of themostimportant points to remember is that cutaneous biopsy sites should not
be scrubbed and cleaned as this will remove important clues regarding the diagnosis. It
is often difficult for veterinarians to feel comfortable cutting through crust and scale
without scrubbing the area.Most cutaneous biopsiescanbe taken withlocalanesthesia
vialidocaine injection into the subcutaneous region.Some fractious animals may re
quire sedation such as with aketamine/valium cocktail.Excisional biopsies or ellipses
are often thebest choice.When punchbiopsies are chosen,remember to use a 6-mm and
avoid the 2- and 4-mm punches as the sections are too small for good sample size.The
following“rules”apply to the question of
How to Biopsy:
1. Never scrub or cleanse the area prior to excision-the surface crust may contain the
pathologic changes necessary to make a diagnosis.
2. Use a surgical blade to obtain a wedge-shaped orelliptical biopsy when sectioning the
nose, footpad,vesicles,bullae, deep lesions (vasculitis,panniculitis,etc.).
3.When using a punch biopsy, choose the 6-mm size.
4. When using a punch biopsy, rotate in one direction only and do not re-use the tool
as the blade is easily dulled and may cause the tissue to tear during the procedure.
5.When usinglidocaine,place the anesthesia inthe subcutaneous compartment andnot
intradermally.
6.Try not to handle the tissue with forceps (crushing artifact) but rather use a small-
gauge needle tomanipulate the tissue.
7.Place the sample immediately in the formalin.
8.Small or thin specimens may be placed on a small piece of a tongue depressor with
the haired portion on the outside toprevent curling and then floatedupside down in
the formalin.
9.Avoid freezing.
Remember to provide your pathologist with a thorough history and clinical description
of the lesions.I routinely include a copy of the referral letter with the biopsy request.
That letter outlines the history，clinical signs,differential diagnoses considered,and a
plan.You andyour pathologist shouldbecome a diagnostic team.It is unrealistic to ex
pect that the pathologist can consistently provide answers if we do not supply the ap-
propriate tissue or information.

Interpretation
Three Basic Partterns
Lack of Suppression
All cortisol values remain above 1 μg/dL (30 nmol/L). This pattern is consistent with
Cushing's disease.
Suppression
Cortisol values fall below 1 μg/dL (30 nmol/L) at 4 and 8hours. This pattern suggests
that the animal does not have Cushing's disease.
EscapefromSuppression
Cortisol value falls below 1 μg/dL(30 nmol/L) at 4 hours and rises above 1 μg/dL at 8
hours.This pattern is consistent with pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease.
HIGH-DOSE DEXAMETHASONE SUPPRESSION TEST (HDDST)
Administer 1mg/kg dexamethasone(Azium) IV or IM.Obtain serum samples before
and 4and 8hours after injection of dexamethasone for cortisol assay.
Interpretation
8-hour testing period is considered suppression.Suppression after a high dose of dexam-
ethasone is consistent with pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease.Lack of suppression (all
cortisolvaluesremain above 1.5μg/dL) is diagnostic of a pituitary or adrenal tumor.
THYROIDGLANDDISORDERS
TSHSTIMULATIONTEST
Administer 0.5 U/kg TSH (maximum dose,5 U) IV.Obtain serum samples before and
6hours after injection of TSH for T4 determination.
Interpretation
Post-TSHTlevels<3μg/dL (35nmol/L)are consistentwith hypothyroidism.
TRHSTIMULATIONTEST
Administer 0.1 mg/kgTRHIV.Obtain serum samplesbefore and4hours afterTRH in-
jection for T4 determination.
Interpretation
An increaseinTconcentration<50%afterTRH administration is consistentwith hy
pothyroidism.
TSuppressionTest
Obtain ablood sample for determination of T and T.The serum is removed and kept
refrigeratedor frozen.AdministerT(Cytomel,Smith,Kline,andFrenchLaboratories)
POat a dosageof 25μg/cat q8h for 2 days.On the morning of the third day,adminis-
ter 25μgof T3,and 2-4hours later obtain a second blood sample for T3 and T4 deter-
minations. The basal (day 1) and postoral T serum samples should be submitted to the
laboratory together to avoid interassayvariation.
Interpretation
Serum T4concentration after administration of T > than 1.5 μg/dL(20 nmol/L) is con-
sistent with hyperthyroidism.
GASTRINOMA
SECRETINSTIMULATIONTEST
Administer 2units of secretin/kg IV.Take blood samples before administration of se
cretinand then2,5,10,15,and30minuteslater.Assaythe samples torgastrin
676The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinical Companion
Interpretation
Dogs with gastrinomas have a rise in gastrin levels after the injection of secretin.In three
reported cases,rwo dogs had a rise in gastrin levels 2 times baseline 5minutes after secretin
injection, and one dog had a rise in gastrin levels 1.4 times baseline 5 minutes after secretin
injection. Normal dogs have a decline in gastrin levels after administration of secretin.
CALCIUMCHALLENGE TEST
Administer 2mg/kg of calcium gluconate IV over a 1-minute period or administer 5
mg/kg of calcium gluconate as an IV infusion over several hours. Obtain a blood sam-
ple before calcium administration and then 15,30,60,90,and 120 minutes after the
calcium administration. Assay the samples for gastrin.
Interpretation
Two reported patients with gastrinoma had a doubling of the gastrin level 60minutes
after the calcium infusion.
SEXHORMONEDISORDERS
Gn-RHSTIMULATIONTEST
Administer0.5-1.0μg of Gn-RH/kgIM.Obtainblood samplesbefore Gn-RHadmin-
istration and 1 hour later. Assay blood samples for testosterone.
Interpretation
Normal dogs have baseline testosterone levels between 0.55 ng/mL,and after admin
istration of Gn-RH the testosterone levels rise above 5 ng/mL.Animals with hypoan-
drogenism have lower values.
HCGSTIMULATIONTEST
Administer44IU ofhCG/kgIM.Obtainblood samplesbefore hCG administrationand
4 hours later. Assay blood samples for testosterone.
Interpretation
Normal dogs have baseline testosterone levels between O.5-5 ng/mL, and after admin
istration of hCG,the testosterone levels rise above 5ng/mL.Animals with hypoandro
genism have lower values.
DIABETESINSIPIDUS
MODIFIEDWATERDEPRIVATIONTEST
Rule out other causes of polyuria and polydipsia (especially hyperadrenocorticism). Be-
gin water restriction 3 days before abrupt water deprivation.
Day 1130-165 mL/kg/day
Day 2100-125 mL/kg/day
Day365-70mL/kg/day (normalmaintenance requirement)
Themorning of the fourth day,discontinue food and water. Start the test.Weigh the patient
and empty the bladder.Weigh at 12hour intervals.Monitorcarefully for dehydration and
depression.When5% of body weight is lost or azotemia develops,empty the bladder and
check urine specific gravity. Consider plasma vasopressin determination at this point.
Interpretation
If the urine specific gravity is > 1.025 (dogs) or > 1.030 (cats), stop the test. The pa-
tient does not have diabetes insipidus. If the urine specific gravity is not > 1.025 (dogs)
or > 1.030 (cats), administer 0.55 U/kg aqueous vasopressin IM (maximum dose, 5 U).
Empty the bladder and check urine specific gravity at 30,60,and 120 minutes postad-
ministration.If urine specific gravity increases <10%,nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
is indicated; if it increases 10-50%,partial central diabetes insipidus is indicated; if it
increases 50-80%, complete central diabetes insipidus is indicated.
