Chapter 2
Periodontal Probing
INDICATIONS
Every patient that is anesthetized for any dental procedure should have a complete dental examination
performed, including periodontal probing of every tooth surface.
EQUIPMENT
Periodontal Probe
Round or flat
Some marked with indentations at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 mm
Some marked in alternating 3-mm bands of black and silver
Pressure-sensitive: plastic probe with additional indicator that is depressed when too much pressure is applied 
Periodontal Explorer (opposite end of many probes)
"Shepherd's hook": sharp, slender tip used as tactile instrument to detect soft enamel (pre-carious), open
canals and enamel defects, especially feline resorptive lesions (see Figure 2.2)
PROCEDURE
Some initial probing may be done before starting the dental cleaning to identify specific areas of concern.
Complete probing and charting must be done after plaque and calculus are removed because areas will be
occluded with the debris.
After cleaning each "half mouth,”" examine and probe the buccal/facial surfaces of the "up" side and the
lingual/palatal surfaces of the "down" side.

the base (see Figure 2.3).
Note: with inflamed pockets, the probe can easily be pushed past the base attachment because the
tissue is delicate-use great care!
Eig. 2.1 Two periodontal probes, the bottom one with alternating black and silver bands each 3 mm long and the
top one with indentations at 1, 2, 3, 5,7, 8,9, and 10 mm.
Eig. 2.2 "Shepherd's hook" tip of periodontal explorer.
Eig. 2.3 The tip of a periodontal probe is gently inserted into the gingival sulcus or pocket and advanced carefully
to the base (without penetrating tissue further).
with interproximal contact points, the probe cannot be advanced circumferentially around the tooth).
Measure and record any abnormalities encountered.
Note if greater than 2 to 3 mm in dog (take size of dog into account).
Note if greater than 0.5 mm in cat (see

Record "RE" and millimeter depth on chart.
lIf additional pocket formation, mark that as well.
Attachment Loss (Al; also see Chapter 23, Periodontal Disease: Periodontitis)
AL is the combination of periodontal pocket and root exposure (see
Figure 2.5
1
Total attachment loss is the measurement from the neck of the tooth (CEJ, or cementoenamel junction)
to the depth of the pocket.

Lower first molar, mesial and distal surfaces (see Figure 2.8): Deep pockets at either aspect of this tooth
 may indicate no external problems, so careful probing is essential.
The periodontal explorer's sharp tip is very tactile, making it a useful tool in further evaluation.
Evaluate areas of tooth wear or fracture to determine if canal is exposed (see Figure 2.9).
Evaluate areas of potential resorptive lesions in cats (see Figure 2.10).
Eig. 2.7 Any attachment loss between the mandibular third incisor and canine can compromise the tooth, so
early intervention is essential.
Eig. 2.8 A 4 to 5-mm pocket at the distal aspect of the mandibular first molar indicates significant attachment
loss at the second molar, so its extraction may allow more complete treatment of the significant first molar.
Eig. 2.9 The explorer should be used on a worn tooth surface to determine whether a canal is exposed or, as in
this case, if the explorer glides along the very smooth surface of the worn tooth with reparative dentin (brown

COMMENTS
This procedure is very simple to perform on all teeth immediately after the cleaning.
This procedure can also be used at the initial exam or at the beginning of the procedure to identify teeth that
 require additional evaluation and possible treatment early in the process.
Some teeth examined will be obviously nonvital, and others will be difficult to determine.
Use this tool as one of several in evaluating the pulpal vitality of teeth.
If results are inconclusive, mark the chart as to the findings and note that further monitoring will be needed.

Intraoral Radiology
INDICATIONS
Intraoral radiology is an integral part of veterinary dentistry, from diagnostics to therapy to evaluation of response
to therapy.
Ideal: full-mouth radiographs on every patient, each dental visit
Survey: assess normal anatomy, use as baseline
Tooth abnormalities: size, structure, variation in number (absence or multiple)
Periodontal disease: assess extent and nature of periodontal bone loss
Endodontic disease: assess pulpal vitality, canal width, and presence of periapical bone loss
Acquired diseases: caries, resorptive lesions
Trauma: evaluate extent of osseous and dental damage
Neoplasia: evaluate extent of osseous involvement

PROCEDURE
Taking Radiographs
For intraoral films, the patient must be under general anesthesia; all considerations should be met
(preoperative diagnostics, patient monitoring and support).
Eig. 4.2 Commonly used intraoral films, sizes no. 4 (occlusal, pictured top right) and no. 2 (periapical, bottom
right), with no. 2 digital sensor (left).
Eig.4.3A The layers of an intraoral film include the film encased in a black paper sheath with a lead sheet on the
back side to prevent backscatter.
Always place the white surface toward the radiographic beam.
Lead sheet on back side of film prevents backscatter but will be visible if film is placed incorrectly (see
Figures 4.3a

Embossed dimple on film helps position film properly; convex side faces X-ray beam, concave side faces
the inside of patient's mouth (see
Figure 4.4
 Place the film so that the image captured will be of the roots, not the crown (see Figure 4.5).
Parallel technique places the film in a position parallel to the tooth or roots.
Position the intraoral film or sensor just lingual and parallel to the mandibular premolars and molars;
place the diagonal of the film across the position of the roots, with a corner sticking into the
intermandibular space (see Figures 4.6, 4.7).
The radiographic beam is aimed perpendicular to both film and teeth.
Shadow technique, also called modified bisecting angle technique, is used in cases where the film cannot be
 placed parallel to the tooth or roots.

Reading Films
Look at films with the "dot" coming out toward you.
Eig. 4.27 A metal clip on the film willfacilitate hand developing.
Eig. 4.28 Digital films are captured as if you were viewing the film from the outside in. You can arrange the films
during exposure or afterward to correlate with the proper teeth.
Eig. 4.29 Reading a radiograph:
1. Find the dot: place the film so you are looking with the dot coming out toward you; the surface of the film
now facing you is the facial surface.
 2. Identify if maxillary or mandibular; adjust film so roots point accordingly.
3. Determine which is the rostral and caudal extent of the film.
4. Determine left or right. This film is:
Maxillary
Front to back, from left to right, fourth premolar to first molar
Right maxillary fourth premolar and first molar
Determine whether maxilla or mandible: position roots accordingly (mandibular roots pointing down, maxillary
roots pointing up).
Ildentify teeth— premolar versus molar-to determine "nose to tail."
From there, you can determine whether it is the right or left side (see Figure 4.29).
Using a panoramic dental chart or skull may help in determining this.
Exception: extraoral film taken of feline maxillary premolars. In this case, right and left will be opposite as
compared to an intraoral film (see Figure 4.30).
Evaluation of Films
Periodontal disease
Assess the extent.
Extensive bone loss may alert you to compromised jaw strength if extractions are planned.
Assess the pattern of bone loss.
Crestai bone loss is a loss of osseous height or flattening in between teeth or in furcation; it is one of the
indicators of initial periodontal bone loss (see
Figure 4.31
1.
Horizontal bone loss is a pattern of bone loss across several roots or teeth in a flattened or scalloped
loss; if accompanied by gingival recession, it will result in root and/or furcation exposure (see
Figure 4.32
1.
Verticai bone loss is a pattern of bone loss extending down the axis of a root or roots; it often is
associated with a deep infrabony pocket; if it extends to the periapical region, pulp can be compromised
(see
Figure 4.33
1.
Eig. 4.30 An extraoral film of feline left maxillary premolars is read just the opposite of an intraoral film; right
and left will be reversed.
Fig. 4.31
1 The first indication of periodontal bone loss is crestal bone loss, usually at the height of the bone in
between adjacent teeth.
Eig. 4.32 Horizontal bone loss occurs with a linear pattern of bone height loss over several roots or even teeth.
Endodonticdisease
 Periapical bone loss is an indication of extension of pulpal infection into periapical region (see Figure
4.34).
Disproportionate canal width (larger) as compared to a similar tooth may indicate the pulp is
nonvital—that is, dentin is no longer being deposited (see Figure 4.35).
Resorptive lesions (primarily cats)
Evaluate the distinction between tooth, periodontal ligament space, and bone.
In true odontoclastic lesions, often the root structure is difficult to distinguish from surrounding bone, and 
In some cases where periodontal disease and attachment loss (gingiva, bone) have exposed roots, there

Some teeth may have resorption on the crown but not odontoclastic activity or root resorption on
radiographs. Periodontitis may occur with root exposure due to gingiva and bone loss, with erosion of the exposed
portion, but the submerged root remains intact.
Operative evaluation
Preextraction
Evaluate the integrity of the periodontal ligament space. If not present, it may indicate resorption or
ankylosis, and typical extraction with periodontal ligament elevation may not be possible (see 
Figure 4.38
1.
Evaluate any abnormalities such as extra roots, abnormally shaped roots (dilacerated), or compromised
bone.

Trauma
Intraoral films can target specific areas of traumaticdamage.
Sometimes full skull radiographs give a broader picture of the extent of damage.
Neoplasia
Any suspicious lesion should be radiographed and biopsied (see Figure 4.39).
COMMENTS
Every practice should consider implementing intraoral radiology to provide the best level of dental care possible.

Root Planing and Periodontal Pocket Therapy
INDICATIONS
Root planing is done to remove deposits of plaque, calculus, and debris from the tooth surfaces in periodontal

PROCEDURE
Provide preoperative and intraoperative (local) analgesia where appropriate.
Identify and select periodontal pockets of appropriate depth for additional therapy (3 to 5 mm; see Figures
6.2a, 6.2b).
Select an appropriate hand curette and insert into the depth of the pocket, adjusting the cutting edge to
contact the tooth surface (see Figures 6.3a, 6.3b)
With a pull stroke, bring the curette edge down the surface of the root, dislodging calculus and debris; use this

As the surface is cleaned of debris, the tactile (and auditory) sensation will go from a rough feel to a smooth
feel.
 gently debride the diseased soft tissue (subgingival curettage or debridement). There will be moderate

Gingival Flaps
INDICATIONS
This chapter discusses flap design; for additional extraction steps, see Chapter 8, Extraction Technique.
EQUIPMENT
15C scalpel blade with handle (see Figure 7.1a)
Periosteal elevator (Molt no. 2 or no. 4; see Figure 7.1a)
Thumb forceps (see Figure 7.1b)
Needle holders
Small, sharp scissors (see Figure 7.1b)
PROCEDURE
Provide adequate pain management: preoperative, multimodal, local blocks, and postoperative dispensing.
Make an appropriate antimicrobial selection.
Determine flaps for extraction.
General Concepts - Flaps for Extractions
Adequate exposure is necessary to facilitate the extraction procedure and flap closure afterward.
Full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is typically used.
Releasing incision should extend through the attached gingiva, past the mucogingival line, into alveolar 
mucosa, typically just past the edge of the tooth, in the interdental area (see Figure 7.2).
Freshen the edge of the gingival margin with the blade by removing 1mm before the flap is elevated (see
Figure 7.3).
Introduce the blade tip into the sulcus around the tooth to release the junctional epithelium at the base of the
sulcus (see Figure 7.4)
Gently elevate or stretch the palatal or lingual gingiva as well.
up on the flap with forceps; gently excise periosteal fibers until release is apparent (see Figure 7.6b). Don't go
through full thickness.
After the extraction, close the flap with absorbable suture material, making simple interrupted sutures.

Eig Z.3 The blade can be used to freshen the gingival margin edge before elevation.
Eig Z.4 The tip of the blade can be introduced into the sulcus to release the junctional epithelium around the
tooth.
Eig Z.5b Elevation is continued until the flap is released to the level past the mucogingival junction.
Specific Extractions
Maxillary canines
Make mesial (rostral) incision directly up.
Make distal incision angled caudally following the direction of the root (see Figure 7.7).
It is essential on this tooth to provide release by excising periosteal fibers, especially if an oronasal fistula
is present.
Maxillaryfourthpremolar
Mesial (rostral) incision is typically sufficient to release the flap; a distal incision may damage salivary
ducts (see Figure 7.8a).
Figure 7.8b).
Mandibular first molar
Make mesial and distal incisions.
adequate closure.
Eig Z.6a The periosteal fibers on the underside of the flap must be gently excised to remove tension on the flap.
Eig Z6b Once the fibers are excised, the flap can be extended easily so that when it is sutured, there will be no
tension.
Eig Z.Z After the mesial (rostral) incision is made, a distal incision, angled distally to follow the root, is made.
Eig Z.&a A single releasing incision at the mesial (rostral) aspect of the upper fourth premolar is usually sufficient
for release, as a distal incision could damage salivary ducts.
Eig Z.8b With proper release, the mesial corner of the flap will be rotated (after tooth extraction) to be sutured
near the site of the palatal root.
Mandibular canine
 Start incision at distal aspect of canine for 2 to 3 mm, following the linguo-distal direction of the root (see
Figure 7.9).
At the caudal extent of the first incision, make buccal and lingual releasing incisions in a Y pattern; avoid
cutting through the frenulum (the fold of mucosa on the buccal aspect; see Figure 7.10).
An incision at the mesial (rostral) aspect of the tooth can be made for additional release (see Figure 7.11).
Eig Z.9 A distal incision is made at the distal aspect of the lower canine.
Eig Z.10 A lingual and buccal/labial releasing incision (preserve the frenulum) can further provide access to the
alveolar bone at the distal aspect of the tooth.
Eig Z.11 An incision at the mesial (rostral) aspect of the mandibular canine will allow better access.

gingival flap will expose the site for adequate treatment.
As compared to extractions with interdental releasing incisions, the gingival margin around the tooth to be
periodontally treated should be preserved.
Releasing incision should be made at the adjacent tooth, at the line angle; that is, halfway between the
outside aspect of the tooth and the mid point of the root (see Figure 7.12).
Not interdentally;
Not at the furcation;
Not directly over the midpoint of the root.

Specially designed flaps, such as a crescent-shaped flap at the palatal aspect of a maxillary canine, will
expose the site for effective treatment of deep infrabony pockets that have not yet progressed to
oronasal fistula.
Attention to the palatal artery to preserve it within the flap is optimum.

In dogs, a small reverse cutting needle will help get through the tough gingiva best.
In cats, a small taper needle may cause less trauma, especially in inflamed tissues.
COMMENTS
Without flaps, certain treatments would be ineffective (e.g., root planing of deep pockets) or cause trauma to
the patient (e.g., extraction without exposure for tooth sectioning or alveolar bone removal).

The term crown amputation might not be a favorable one with clients. Call it a modified extraction
technique instead.
 Follow all general steps of local analgesia, flap (envelope), and sectioning tooth (if multirooted).
Begin elevation: the tooth crown usually will snap off (premolars). Some canine teeth will not be easily
removed; crown amputation may be necessary in those cases to avoid traumatizing the mandible.
Suture the site closed (cruciate suture).
Radiographs are essential! Some externally appearing "resorptive" lesions have intact roots that must be
elevated (see Figure 4.37 in Chapter 4).
COMMENTS
Extraction techniques should be sequential and deliberate, using patience.
Rushing a procedure or using too much force can result in:
Broken root tips,
Broken jaws,
Instruments slipping into other tissues (eyes, etc).
Perform appropriate preoperative diagnostics when indicated prior to procedure.
Apply appropriate antimicrobial and pain management therapy when indicated.

General Comments
Persistent deciduous teeth can cause the permanent teeth to erupt in abnormal positions, resulting in a
malocclusion. Early recognition and intervention are essential.

When the permanent tooth erupts, the deciduous tooth should be exfoliated.
Maxillary canine teeth erupt mesial (rostral) to the persistent deciduous canine teeth, which can narrow the
space (diastema) between the maxillary canine and third incisor, leaving no room for the lower canine tooth (see
Figure 9.2).

on the degree of hypovestibulosis.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGV
Congenital, hereditary, or developmental factors may result in tight lip syndrome.
Systems affected: This syndrome can inhibit the full growth potential of the mandible, resulting in a Class 2
malocclusion. It can also lead to a Class 1 malocclusion (anterior malocclusion) by forcing a distal or lingual
displacement of the mandibular incisors and sometimes canine teeth. In addition, the soft tissues of the lower
lip are frequently traumatized.
ISIGNALMENT ANDHISTORY
Tight lip syndrome is seen almost exclusively in Chinese shar-pei dogs but can be seen in other canine breeds.
Evidence of tight lip can be detected shortly after birth in more severe cases but is usually noticed following
eruption of the deciduous teeth. Rarely, tight lip manifests after permanent tooth eruption.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Tight lip syndrome is classified according to the extent of the condition.
Type 1 (mild): lip covers incisors only
Type 2 (moderate): lip covers incisors and canines
Type 3 (severe): lip covers incisors and canines and extends over premolars

Palatal Defects: Congenita!
IDEFINITIONANDOVERVIEW
Primary palatal cleft (palatoschisis): located at the junction/suture of the incisive bone and one or both of the
maxillary processes; may be associated with cleft lip (cheiloschisis; see Figure 18.1)
Secondary palatal cleft: defect on midline behind incisal area involving the soft and/or hard palate
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Occurs in dogs and cats
 Palatal cleft may result from failure of the developing paired palatine processes to fuse properly.
Teratogens include infectious agents, corticosteroids, excessive vitamin A or D, X-ray radiation,
griseofulvin, hormones, and nutritional deficiencies.
In many cases with a wide variety of breeds, there has likely been an intrauterine insult during feta

ISIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Gingivitis occurs in both dogs and cats.
More than 80 percent of patients 3 years of age and older have gingivitis.
Toy dog breeds show a higher prevalence earlier in life.
Cats generally are affected later in life than dogs.

Rawhide chew strips help clean the teeth mechanically and exercise the attachment apparatus but should not
be relied upon as the sole method of home care.
Hard food leaves less substrate on the teeth than soft food does; chewing also helps clean teeth mechanically.

Expected Course and Prognosis
Professional periodontal therapy followed by postoperative home care completely reverses gingivitis.
Regular oral reexaminations are necessary so the clinician can determine the proper interval between
periodontal therapies and assess the effectiveness of oral home care; these steps can cure gingivitis and help
avoid the progression to periodontitis.
Uncontrolled periodontitis invariably leads to tooth loss.

DIAGNOSTICS
Maxillary canines are most commonly affected.
The palatal root of the maxillary fourth premolar is next most common.
Inserting a periodontal probe into the pocket along the palatine surface of the maxillary canine tooth often
causes hemorrhage from the ipsilateral nostril, confirming an oronasal fistula.
Radiographs rarely diagnose oronasal fistula because the lesions are generally isolated to the medial surface.
Radiographs may show foreign body entrapment or lysis consistent with neoplasia.

Bone grafts such as PerioGlas, Consil, synthetic and natural hydroxyapatite, autogenous and heterologous
bone, polylactic acid, and calcium disulfate have been used to exclude regrowth of gingival connective
tissue and epithelium, promoting regeneration of bone and periodontal ligament.
Oronasal fistulas located in the central portion of the hard palate can be surgically repaired with a
transposition flap of the hard palate mucoperiosteum from tissue adjacent to the defect.

Enamel and Dentin Problems
Chapter 28
Discolored Teeth
IDEFINITIONANDOVERVIEW
Discolored teethare those exhibiting any change in color from the norm. The normal color varies and depends on
the shade, translucency, and thickness of enamel. Discoloration may also be called intrinsic staining, extrinsic
staining, tetracycline staining,or chiorhexidine staining.There are two basic kinds of discoloration.
Extrinsic: from surface accumulation of exogenous pigment
Intrinsic: secondary to endogenous factors discoloring the underlying dentin
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Extrinsic Discoloration
Plaque-related—black-brown stain; usually secondary to formation of ferric sulfide from interaction of
bacterial ferric sulfide and iron in saliva
Foods-from charcoal biscuits and similar products that penetrate the pits and fissures of the enamel;
Dental restorative materials-black-gray discoloration resulting from amalgam
Medications
Products containing iron or iodine give a black discoloration.
Those containing sulfides, silver nitrate, or manganese give a gray-to-yellow to brown-to-black
discoloration.
Those containing copper or nickel give a green discoloration.
Metal
Wear from chewing on cages or food dishes
Discoloration from removed orthodontic brackets or bands
Crown fragments—less translucency due to dehyd ration of fragment
Discolored restorations
Tooth wear with dentin exposure—tertiary dentin, reparative dentin, secondary dentin
Intrinsic Discoloration
Hyperbilirubinemia: discoloration affecting all teeth
bilirubin accumulation in the dentin occurs from excess red blood cell breakdown.
Localized red blood cell destruction: usually in one tooth and usually following traumatic injury to tooth
Discoloration comes from hemoglobin breakdown within the pulp from a pulpitis and secondary release
into adjacent dentinal tu bules.

Blood factors that cause tooth discoloration are hemoglobin, methe-moglobin, hematoidin,
hemosiderin, hematin, hemin, and sulfmethe-moglobin.
Teeth have a chalky appearance and a pinkish hue.
This condition can be a problem in the formation of the organic matrix, the mineralization of the matrix,
or the maturation of the matrix.
from the dentin, resulting in grayish discoloration
have many modes of inheritance: x-linked dominant, x-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, autosomal
recessive.
OThe mode of inheritance in animals has not been studied.
Infectious agents (systemic): parvovirus, distemper virus, or any infectious agent that causes a sustained 
body temperature rise; affects the formation of enamel
A distinct line of resolution is visible on the teeth and affects all teeth. It results in enamel hypoplasia
(hypocalcification), where the pitted areas have black edges and the dentin is brownish.
Dental fluorosis: affects all teeth
Excess fluoride consumption affects the maturation of enamel, resulting in pits (enamel hypoplasia) with
black edges.
The enamel is a lusterless, opaque white, with yellow-brown zones of discoloration.
Internal and External Resorption
Inte rnal resorption
Usually only one tooth is affected.
The tooth has a pinkish hue.
External resorption
Many factors cause this condition, such as trauma, orthodontic treatment, excessive occlusal forces,
periodontal disease, tumors, and periapical inflammation.
Osteoclasts resorb the tooth structure.
Medications that may result in discoloration
Tetracycline
Binds to calcium, forming a calcium orthophosphate complex that is laid down into the collagen matrix
of enamel
Results in a yellow-brown discoloration
Occurs on all teeth
Occurs only when enamel is being formed
Amalgam (as with extrinsic stains)
lodine or essential oils
Macrolide antibiotic (reported in humans)
hypocalcifi-cation giving a white discolored lesion with horizontal stripes on the enamel
From endodontically treated teeth with the mendicants penetrating the dentinal tubules
USIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Extrinsic staining is very common, especially bacterial stains; others are less common.
Intrinsic staining is likewise very common, especially internal and external resorption, followed by localized red
blood cell destruction; the other causes are rare.
Discoloration of the teeth occurs in dogs and cats.
It affects all species and all breeds.
There are no sex predilections.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Abnormal coloration of tooth or teeth
Rings or lines of discoloration around tooth or teeth

IDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Calculus on teeth
Normal tooth aging, which includes increased translucence
DIAGNOSTICS
Dental radiography is extremely useful in identifying internal or external resorption, restorative materials, or
bacterial stain from coronal percolation.
If many teeth are affected, one tooth can be extracted and sent for histologic evaluation.
 Extrinsic discoloration-all stain in enamel or exposed dentin, otherwise tooth structure normal
affected
Internal resorption-well-circumscribed enlargement of an area of the endodontic system with
osteoclasts
irregular matrix formation to the enamel and dentin); all teeth affected
Transillumination with a strong fiber-optic light can benefit the clinician by distinguishing between vital and
necrotic pulp.
Appropriate preoperative diagnostics should be performed when indicated prior to procedure.
THERAPEUTICS
Appropriate patient monitoring and support during anesthetic procedures
Extrinsic stain removal: mainly cosmetic, to remove inciting cause
Intrinsic stain treatment: functional and pain relieving
Procedures
Extrinsic stain: internal and/or external bleaching; veneers or crowns
Intrinsic stain: possible endodontic treatment (internal resorption and localized red blood cell destruction)
Restorative procedures such as crowns or veneers to protect both tooth and pulp

Dental Caries (Cavities)
IDEFINITIONANDOVERVIEW
Caries is the decay of the dental hard tissues (enamel, cementum, and dentin) due to the effects of oral
bacteria on fermentable carbohydrates on the tooth surface.

Conduct a visual examination, looking for a clean, dry tooth surface under good light and magnification.
Explore with a sharp dental explorer. The explorer will sink into carious dentin and stick, providing the
Subgingival exploration will reveal irregularities in the root surface.
Intraoral dental radiography will help the clinician examine the affected tooth carefully.

For root caries, if the periodontal disease can be managed and the restoration placed supragingivally,
restoration may be possible; however, for most teeth with root caries, extraction will be the treatment of
choice.
If only one root of a multirooted tooth is carious, extraction of the affected root with endodontic treatment of
the remaining root(s) is also an option.
For dogs at high risk of developing more lesions in the future, application of a pit-and-fissure sealant on the

Expected Course and Prognosis
Stage 1 and 2 lesions, if well debrided and restored, bear an excellent long-term prognosis.
For more advanced lesions, the prognosis depends on proper endodontic treatment as well as restoration to
maintain or reestablish the anatomy and strength of the crown of the tooth.

DIAGNOSTICS
Complete oral examination
Use a dental explorer to palpate, drawing it across worn tooth surfaces.
The surface may be worn and smooth or rough due to chips or minor fractures with brown center but
solid, indicating reparative dentin forming to protect the retreating pulp.
An open canal indicates compromised pulp.
Transillumination (see Chapter 3, Transillumination)
Shine light through the teeth to evaluate pulp vitality. A vital tooth will allow light to shine through.
Transillumination should be used in conjunction with other diagnostics.
Radiographs (see Chapter 4, Intraoral Radiology)
Evaluate the canal width. A disproportionately wider canal is indicative of a nonvital pulp.

If inconclusive at the time, reevaluate on a regular basis, especially if trauma continues.
THERAPEUTICS
Procedures
Assess the damage and then determine the course of action.
Gradual or chronic wear with vital pulp and no canal exposure
Continue to monitor and attempt to rectify the cause.
Recommend modifications to chewing habits, treat dermatitis, etc.
Recent or acute wear or fracture with vital pulp and no canal exposure
Consider a dentinal bonding agent to seal dentinal tubules.
Attempt to rectify the cause.
Extensive wear with open canal or compromised pulp
Extract the tooth or administer endodontic (root canal) therapy.
Maintain appropriate patient monitoring and support during anesthetic procedures.
COMMENTS
When enamel is worn off and dentin is exposed, reparative dentin is deposited on the pulpal side of the
exposed dentin, allowing the pulp to retreat behind a layer of mineralized tissue. If the condition is gradual and
chronic, this process can provide protection, though the quality of the reparative dentin is variable (related to
intensity and duration of stimulus).
Dentinal sealants may be considered in cases of acute tubule exposure.
These sealants prevent ingression of bacteria and bacterial by-products through the open dentinal
tu bules.

Dentinal sealants provide no benefit for chronic conditions with already-formed reparative dentin. The

In uncomplicated fractures with the fracture line close to the pulp chamber, pale pink pulp is visible
through the dentin; gentle probing with a dental explorer will not allow the explorer into the pulp cavity.
In complicated crown fractures, the pulp chamber is open and readily accessed with an explorer.
The fresh complicated fracture is associated with hemorrhage from the pulp.
Older fractures may exhibit a necrotic pulp; clinically the pulp chamber is filled with dark necrotic
material, and the tooth is often discolored.

Advise the client to avoid situations in which teeth are likely to be damaged; for example, keep the patient
from chewing on hard objects such as rocks.
To avoid complications, institute treatment within hours of injury.
Untreated pulpal exposure invariably leads to pulpitis and eventual pulpal necrosis and periapical pathology.
If the pulp is compromised in an immature tooth, further development of the tooth will be stopped.
Expected Course and Prognosis
Prognosis varies with the vitality of the pulp, location of the fracture, and whether the tooth is mature or
immature; see the previous Treatment section for a detailed discussion of these factors.

Tooth Root Abscess (Apical Abscess)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
nonvital tooth creates a root abscess or periapical abscess.
ETIOLOGY ANDPATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Acute exacerbation of a chronic periapical abscess is called a phoenix abscess.
An abscess can divide into acute and chronic phases on the basis of severity of pain and presence or absence of
systemic signs and symptoms.
Systemic spread of bacteria (bacteremia and pyemia) can affect other organ systems.
endo lesion).
Potential causes of an abscess include:
Any pulpal trauma
Direct blow causing fracture of the crown of severe pulpitis and pulpal necrosis
Chewing hard objects (e.g., bones, hooves, rocks, wood, especially with knots), most commonly affecting
carnassials
Malocclusive trauma
"Tugging" rags with puppies

Septicemia: documented in humans but not yet proven in animals
Small animals on long-term corticosteroids
Diabetes or Cushing's disease
Radiation necrosis
Extension of caries decay into the endodontic system
ISIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Occurs in dogs and cats
Can occur in deciduous and permanent dentition
Usually occurs in active animals that bite or chew a lot or chase objects (balls, cars, etc.)
CLINICAL FEATURES
Tooth visibly broken—90 percent of cases
Malocclusive trauma where there is constant trauma to the tooth is the exception.
Tooth only cracked, with pulp or near pulp exposure
Tooth appears discolored
Note: Acute tooth fracture with pulp exposure would be sensitive.
Facial swelling
Cutaneous sinus exuding pus, typically below the eye (suborbital)
Slight facial sensitivity
Increased accumulation of plaque and calculus on affected side of mouth
Patient does not want to chew, especially on affected side
Patient head-shy
Patient bites but releases quickly instead of holding on
Tooth sensitive to percussion
Putrid smel
Tooth loose and painful on palpation
Possible facial lymphadenitis
Sinusitis, most commonly affecting maxillary sinus
IDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions: Radiographs show no apical lucncy or ab-scessation (see Chapter 46,
Tooth Resorption: Feline).
Squamous cell carcinoma and fibrosarcoma: These malignencies are rapidly growing and invasive; they
displace and increase mobility of the teeth (see discussion of squamous cell carcinoma in Chapters 37, 38, and
39).
Cementoma: This condition radiographically shows enlarged apical roots with a thin radiolucent zone
continuous with the periodontal ligament.

DIAGNOSTICS
Intraoral radiographs are a key diagnostic aid.
An abscess demonstrates thickening of the apical periodontal ligament and has ill-defined radiolucency
The radiograph shows bone loss at the apex as the lesion becomes chronic.
As the lesion progresses, radiographic lesions consistent with osteomyelitis and cellulitis occur.
If fistulization has occurred, the clinician can place a gutta-percha cone into the sinus and take a
radiograph to identify the affected tooth.
Transillumination with a strong fiber-optic light can help the clinician by distinguishing between a vital and a
necrotic pulp.
Therapeutic diagnostics include:
Endodontic treatment evaluation in 6 to 12 months
Histopathologic observation is helpful.

THERAPEUTICS
Drugs
Antibiotics preoperatively to prevent systemic spread of infection
Broad-spectrum antibiotic postoperatively for 7 to 10 days
Analgesics preoperatively intraoperatively and postoperatively for 3 to 4 days
Procedures
 Drain and eliminate the focus of the infection. This may include:
Extraction of the tooth involved, with curettage of the apical infected area
Endodontic treatment of the involved tooth
Surgical endodontic treatment of the involved tooth if the apical lesion is large
Surgical removal of the granulation tissue and curettage of the tract—required for chronic conditions
After treatment, apply cold packs on the area to help reduce inflammation.
Advise the client that the patient should have nothing hard to chew for a few days.
ICOMMENTS
Recheck 10 days postoperatively.

Pulpitis
IDEFINITIONANDOVERVIEW
discolored (pink or purple to gray) by blunt trauma.
Reversible pulpitis involves inflammatory changes of the pulp with potential resolution
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Occurs in dogs and cats
Noxious stimulus to the pulp that stimulates inflammation
Blunt trauma: concussive force
Thermal trauma: improper scaling, polishing, electrosurgery or cavity pre paration
Chemical trauma: improper use of restorative material
Ischemic insult due to apical avulsion or intrusion or thromboembolism
Pulpal exposure due to fracture or caries with resultant bacterial colonization
Excessive orthodontic or occlusal forces
Pulpal edema or hemorrhage
Intrapulpal hemorrhage is apparent when blood cells or pigments enter the dentinal tubules.
Size of pulp chamber and vascularity
These factors can influence the progression of pulpitis and the prognosis.

Infective pulpitis can extend into a periapical infection with bone loss.
ISIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Any age, breed, or size
Younger patients are more likely to have resolution (reversible pulpitis).
In small animals, there is seldom evidence of discomfort or apical drainage (unlike in humans, when acute 
pulpitis in a closed tooth can initially be painful, due to the pressure, until the nerve of the pulp dies).

Epulis
DEFINITION AND OVERVIEW
An epulis is a benign tumor of the oral cavity arising from the periodontal ligament. Categories of epulides are fib
romatous, ossifying, and acanthomatous.
ETIOLOGYVANDPATHOPHVSIOLOGV
Most tumors adhere to bone and are nonencapsulated, with a smooth to slightly nodular surface.
ISIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Most common in brachycephalic breeds
Higher incidence of fibromatous epulides in boxers than in other breeds
Meanage7years
Rare in cats
History often minimal; incidental finding detected on routine physical examination
Excessive salivation

Displacement of tooth structures due to the expansile nature of the mass
Acanthomatous epulides most commonly found on therostral mandible
Possible facial deformity due to asymmetry of the maxilla or mandible
Occasionally cervical lymphadenopathy
Eig. 34.1 Fibrous epulis between right mandibular fourth premolar and first molar.
DIEFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Fibroma (see Chapter 36, Fibrosarcoma)
Benign polyp
Ameloblastoma
Malignant oral tumor (see discussion of squamous cell carcinoma in Chapters 37, 38, and 39)
Gingival hyperplasia (see Chapter 24, Gingival Hyperplasia)
Abscess (see Chapter 32, Tooth Root Abscess [Apical Abscess])
Differentiated from other types of masses by excisional biopsy coupled with radio-graphic appearance
DIAGNOSTICS
Cytologic preparations are rarely diagnostic.
A large, deep tissue biopsy (down to bone) is required to differentiate from other oral masses such as fibroma,
fibrosarcoma, or low-grade fibrosarcoma.
Determine tumor borders by intra oral radiographs.
Eig, 34.2 Ossifying epulis at lingual aspect of left mandibular first molar.
Radiographs of fibromatous epulides typically demonstrate a well-defined area of lysis with margins that
 are distinct, smooth, and sclerotic.
Acanthomatous epulides do not have well-defined borders on radiographs; tooth structures are usually
displaced, and resorption may occur unidirectionally along the lesion's edge in any epulis.
THERAPEUTICS
Drugs
Efficacy of outpatient chemotherapy is unreported; most tumors of mesenchymal origin respond poorly.
Bleomycin injected locally has been successful in treating acanthomaotus epulides.
Chemotherapy can be toxic; seek advice before initiating treatment if you are unfamiliar with cytotoxic
drugs.
Procedures
Fibromatous epulis: Surgical excision with at least 1-cm margins is usually curative. These tumors are of
periodontal ligament stromal origin, so extraction of affected teeth and curettage of the alveolar socket are

small lesions minimally adherent to bone.
Ossifying epulis: Tumors in this category characteristically have a bony matrix, and excision is often more
difficult. Techniques are similar to those for the fibromatous epulis.
Partial man dibulec to my ormaxillectomy is often indicated by the location of the tumor (see Figures 34.3 ,
34.4 ).
radiotherapy plans attempt 40 to 60 Gy over 3 to 6 weeks.
COMMENTS
Perform a thorough oral, head, and neck examination at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months after
treatment.
Take periodic intraoral radiographs, especially for acanthomatous epulides.
Expected Course and Prognosis
Epulides do not metastasize.
margins do not include periodontal structures (i.e., excision includes normal bone).
Mean survival time after surgery of acanthomatous epulides is 43 months (range is 6 to 134 months); mean
survival times for patients with acanthomatous, ossifying, and fibromatous epulides are 52, 29, and 47 months,

Melanocytic Tumors (Oral)
IDEFINITION AND OVERVIEW
Melanocytic tumors are characterized by progressive local invasion of neoplastic melanocytic cells within the
Oral cavity of dogs or cats.
These tumors arise from the gingival surface and grow rapidly.
They are generally characterized by a nonencapsulated, raised, irregular, ulcerated, and/or necrotic surface
and are highly invasive to bone.

DIAGNOSTICS
Cytological evaluation of an impression smear obtained from an incisional biopsy specimen (wedge) may yield
a diagnosis.
■A large, deep tissue biopsy (down to bone) is required to suffciently differentiate a melanocytic tumor from
other oral malignancies.
Carefully palpate regional lymph nodes (mandibular and retropharyngeal).
Immunohisto chemistry may help confirm a diagnosis, particularly if amelanotic.
Radiographic imaging also may be helpful.
Skull radiography: Evaluate for bone involvement deep to the mass.
Thoracic radiographs: Evaluate lungs for metastasis.
THERAPEUTICS
Drugs
Piroxicam: may play a role in pain control and tumor control
Chemotherapy
Carboplatin has been described for local or systemic control of oral melanoma in dogs.
No effective chemotherapy has been described in cats.
Local control (palliation) with intralesionally administered cisplatin has been reported.
Note: Cisplatin should not be used in cats.
drugs.
Procedures
Appropriate patient monitoring and support during anesthetic procedures
Radical surgical excision (e.g., hemimaxillectomy)—- required
Well tolerated by most patients
Improved survival when excisional margins are free of neoplastic cells
Radiation—optional
Course of fraction external beam radiotherapy (teletherapy) in dogs may offer considerable long-term
control if a tumor is deemed inoperable.
Current radiotherapy plans attempt 24 Gy given in three fractions at 0, 7, and 21 days; 36 Gy given in six
weekly fractlohs.
Response in cats has not been re ported.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Gingival carcinoma is highly invasive to the bone with a nonencapsulated, raised, irregular, ulcerated, or
necrotic surface.
In cats, metastasis is rare. Spread to the lymph nodes is more common than to the lungs.
In dogs, metastasis is site dependent. Rostral oral lesions have a low metastatic rate. Caudal oral or tonsillar
lesions have an increased metastatic rate.
Cause of death is secondary to local recurrence, dysphagia, and subsequent cachexia.

cisplatin after 4 hr).
Note: Cisplatin should never be used in cats.
For dogs, butorphanol (o.4 mg/kg IM) before and after cisplatin reduces emesis.
Chemotherapy can be toxic; seek advice before initiating treatment if you are unfamiliar with cytotoxic
drugs.
For dogs, piroxicam (0.3 mg/kg PO daily) may be useful to induce partial remission in some patients. Use with
caution; it can cause ulcerative gastritis.
Procedures
Appropriate patient monitoring and support during anesthetic procedures
Radical surgical excision (e.g., hemimaxillectomy)— required 
Well tolerated by most patients
Must have margins of at least 2 cm
Improved survival when excisional margins are free of neoplastic cells
Radiotherapy
Inpatient radiotherapy offers considerable long-term control if the tumor is deemed inoperable
Most radiotherapy plans attempt 40 to 60 Gy over 3 to 6 weeks.
(Cisplatin should not be used in cats.)
Combined with hyperthermia, radiotherapy does not improve overall survival.
Complications are common in cats (e.g., mucositis, anorexia, and dehydration requiring aggressive
supportive care).
Photodynamic therapy— 17 months of local control in dogs
Soft foods— may be recommended to prevent tumor ulceration or after radical oral excision
COMMENTS
Expected Course and Prognosis

The patient should be intubated. It may be preferred to place a pharyngostomy tube.
Cleanse the oral cavity with an oral chlorhexidine solution.
Inject local anesthesia appropriately.
Assess the fracture by visual, palpation, and radiographic means.
Cleanse and suture soft tissue laceration of injuries.
Reduce the fracture.

Laxity or excessive lateral movement of the mandible
Pain when masticating, yawning, and/or vocalizing
Specific
TMJ luxation or subluxation
History of trauma
Mouth locked open
Radiographic evidence of luxation
Open-mouth mandibular locking
Coronoid process of the mandible “slips" lateral to the ventral surface of the zygomatic arch and is
locked in that position (see Figure 44.1)
Large bulge palpated on affected side of face
Traumatic injury
Evidence of trauma
Mouth dropped open
Mobility of mandible (may have multiple fractures)

Masticatory muscle myositis (MMM), typically in dogs (see Chapter 53, Masticatory Muscle Myositis)
Autoimmune disease of type 2M myofibers of masticatory muscles supplied by trigeminal nerve with
necrosis, phagocytosis, and fibrosis
Trismus progresses to total inability to open jaws
Occurs most commonly in adult, large-breed dogs (e.g., German she pherds)
DIAGNOSTICS
Serum autoantibodies to type 2M myosin-to rule out MMM
Muscle biopsy-to rule out MMM
articular surfaces of the joint are inflamed
Imaging
Skull radiography—essential to perform proper radiographic technique in order to visualize TMJ
MRl—gold standard for imaging TMJ

TMJ luxation, traumatic 
Luxation often occurs in a rostral direction.
Place a dowel across the mouth between the carnassial teeth (see Figure 44.2)
Close the rostral portion of the mouth with a gentle push to reduce the luxation (push caudally for a
rostral luxation).
Chronic luxation may not reduce and may require surgery.
Open-mouth mandibular locking
This condition requires immediate attention.
Sedate the patient.
Open the mouth further, and apply gentle pressure on the bulging coronoid process to allow it to slip back
under the zygomatic arch.

be performed while the patient is sedated.
Later surgical management should be performed with the patient under
general anesthesia.
Injury or fracture at TMJ
Treatment depends on the extent of the damage.
Fixation is difficult.
Condylectomy is sometimes necessary.
Chronic osteoarthritis or ankylosis
 If severe, condylectomy may be needed
COMMENTS
especially after traumatic injury.
Avoid situations that allow for trauma (e.g., pets running loose).
Expected Course and Prognosis
Patients with surgical management in intermittent open-mouth locking often respond well.
Patients with fractures or chronic conditions affecting the osseous structures within the join capsule often
 have a guarded prognosis.

Tooth Luxation or Avulsion
IDEFINITION AND OVERVIEW
Luxation of a tooth can be either vertical (i.e., an intrusion or extrusion) or lateral.
An extrusion occurs when the tooth is dislocated vertically partially outof the alveolus.
In lateral luxation, the affected tooth is tipped in either a labial or a palatal/lingual di-rection. Luxation can
occur when trauma pushes the crown in one direction and the root in the opposite direction. It is always
associated with a fracture of the lingual or labial alveolar bone plate that allows the tooth to dislocate rather
than fracture.
An avulsed tooth is one that has been totally luxated from its alveolus.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Luxation or avulsion usually results from a traumatic incident (e.g., a road traffic accident or a dogfight).
The trauma causes injury to the periodontium, thus allowing abnormal tooth mobility and malpositioning.
The upper canine tooth is the most commonly luxated or avulsed tooth.
Advanced periodontitis will predispose luxation.
SIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
In some patients, a history of facial trauma 
Oral discomfort
Swelling
Reluctance to eat
CLINICAL FEATURES
Intrusion: tooth appears shorter than normal; no tooth mobility detected
Extrusion: tooth appears longer than normal and is mobile both vertically and hori-zontally
Lateral luxation: tooth crown is displaced in either labial or palatal/lingual direction
Avulsion: intact tooth is totally displaced from its alveolus
DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
For luxation: root fracture where the coronal segment is displaced
For avulsion: tooth lost due to severe periodontitis
DIAGNOSTICS
Radiographs are mandatory.
Intrusion: narrowing of the periodontal ligament space in the apical region

Tooth Resorption: Feline
IDEFINITIONANDOVERVIEW
Tooth resorption is defined as resorption of dental hard tissue by odontoclasts.
■ Odontoclasts derive from hematopoietic stem cells, migrate from blood vessels of the periodontal ligament
and alveolar bone toward the external root surface (external resorption), or are recruited from blood vessels of
the pulp and move toward the dentinal surface facing the pulp tissue (internal resorption).

Apical root resorption due to
 Periapical disease after pulpal inflammation and infection
 Orthodontic treatment (resorption arrests after discontinuation of tooth movement)
Apical, lateral, and/or cervical root resorption due to neoplasia
 Benign neoplasm with expansive growth causes pressure resorption along the root surface.

Other reported links with external resorption include (but are not limited to) hypoparathyroidism, drugs
(e.g., anticonvulsants), radiation therapy, oxalosis, tumoral calcinosis, and Paget's disease.

2. Infection of a few circulating B lymphocytes and macrophages that disseminate the virus
3. Replication in lymphoid tissues, intestinal crypt epithelial cells, and bone marrow precursor cells
4. Release of infected neutrophils and platelets from the bone marrow into the circulatory system
5. Infection of epithelial and glandular tissues, with subsequent shedding of virus into the saliva and urine
An adequate immune response stops progression at stage 2 or 3 (4 to 8 weeks after exposure) and forces
the virus into latency.
Persistent viremia (stages 4 and 5) usually develops 4 to 6 weeks after infection but may take as long as
12 wee ks.
All other body systems (other than hemic/immune and nervous) experience immunosuppression with
secondary infections or development of neoplastic disease.
Cat-to-cat transmission occurs in several ways.

Salivary and Other Special Problems
Chapter 50
Salivary Mucocele
DEFINITIONANDOVERVIEW
Salivary mucoceies, also called sialoceles, salivary cysts, or honey cysts, are non-epithelial-lined cavities filled
with saliva that has leaked from a damaged salivary gland or duct. They are surrounded by granulation tissue that
forms secondary to inflammation caused by the free saliva.
There are four major pairs of salivary glands: parotid, mandibular, sublingual, and zygomatic.
Smaller buccal salivary glands are located in the soft palate, lips, tongue, and cheeks.
The various types of mucoceles are listed in Iable 50.1.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Cause is rarely identified. Suspected causes:
 Blunt trauma to the head and neck (e.g., from choke chains)
Bite wound
 Penetrating foreign body
Ear canal surgery
Sialoliths (see Chapter 51, Sialolith)
SIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Occurs three times as frequently in dogs as in cats
Slight predisposition in males No age predilection
All breeds susceptible but some more commonly affected than others:

The drain site should heal by the second intention and contraction following marsupialization.
Complications are uncommon, but a few are possible.
Seroma formation
Infection
Mucocele recurrence
Expected Course and Prognosis
Prognosis is excellent prognosis with complete surgical excision.
Previous infection or injection complicates successful surgical excision.

Sialolith
DEFINITION AND OVERVIEW
Sialolith: salivary stone; formation of stone or concretion in salivary duct or gland
Mucocelestone: soft calculi or mineralized tissue within a mucocele
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Occurs in dogs and cats
Sialolith composed of magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and/or calcium phosphate
puels Aue ul unooo uen ing spuelg seingipueu ul punoy Ajuow wo json
In most cases, likely secondary to inflammation, possibly secondary to trauma
Secondary obstruction can cause swelling of gland with eventual atrophy
SIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Rare
No breed, age, or sex predilections
Swelling (often over the parotid gland)
With or without apparent pain
CLINICAL FEATURES
Sialolith
Swelling in affected area
 Hard mass sometimes palpated
Mucocele stone
Concretion within area of mucocele
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Sialoadenitis
Salivary neoplasia
Foreign body
DIAGNOSTICS
Palpation externally and through oral cavity
Complete oral exam (see Chapter 1, Oral Exam and Charting)
Intraoral or survey radiographs (see Figure 51.1; see also Chapter 4, Intraoral Radiology)
Appropriate preoperative diagnostics when indicated prior to procedure
THERAPEUTICS
Procedures
Appropriate antimicrobial and pain management therapy when indicated
Eig. 51.1 Radiograph of large sialolith in a cat.
Sialolith
If the sialolith is small, apply pressure behind the concretion. Moving forward quickly may move the
sialolith out of the duct.
Make an incision over the stone and remove.
Do not suture (scarring may occur if sutured.)
Allow to heal by secondary intention.
Atrophy if present, may be permanent.
Mucocele stone: See Chapter 50, Salivary Mucocele
Expected Course and Prognosis
The best prognosis for salivary gland functional return is early detection and sialolith removal before atrophy;
otherwise, xerostomia is possible.

Salivary Gland Adenocarcinoma
DEFINITION AND OVERVIEW
Salivary gland adenocarcinoma is a tumor arising from major (e.g., parotid, mandibular, sublingual, or zygomatic)
or minor glands.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHVSIOLOGV
sasee ewou (uenouape puela aealles lle jo juaad og ainsuon spuela ploied io seingiuen
Mandibular gland most frequently affected in dogs
 Parotid gland most frequently affected in cats
The disease is locally invasive.
Cats typically have more advanced disease than dogs at the time of diagnosis.
Sisouseip ie sop jo luaad t pue sien jo suauad e ul pazieisiau apou ydwal ieuoia
Distant metastasis reported in 16 percent of cats and 8 percent of dogs at diagnosis but may be slow to
develop
Other salivary gland neoplasms include carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and mixed neoplasia.
Epithelial malignancies constitute roughly 85 percent of salivary gland tumors.
Fibrosarcomas, lipomas, mast cell tumors, and lymphomas have involved the salivary glands by direct
extension and invasion.
Adenomas comprise only 5 percent of salivary tumors.
ISIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Occurs in dogs and cats
Mean age 10 to 12 years
No breed or sex predilection determined in dogs
In cats, possible higher risk for Siamese
Male cats affected twice as often as female cats
CLINICAL FEATURES
Unilateral, firm, painless swelling in one or more areas
Upper neck (mandibular and sublingual),
Ear base (parotid)
Upper lip or maxilla (zygomatic)
Mucous membrane of lip (accessory or minor salivary tissue)
Other possible signs
Halitosis
Weight loss
Anorexia
Dysphagia
Exophthalmus
Horner's syndrome
Sneezing
Dysphonia
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Squamous cell carcinoma
Mucocele or sialocele (see Chapter 50, Salivary Mucocele)
Abscess
Lymphosarcoma
DIAGNOSTICS
Imaging (see Chapter 4, Intraoral Radiology)
Regional radiographs: usually normal; may see periosteal reaction on adjacent bones or displacement of
surrounding structures
Thoracic radiographs: indicate to check for lung metastases
Histopathology
Cytologic examination of aspirate: differentiates salivary adenocarcinoma from mucocele and abscess
Needle core or wedge biopsy: definitive diagnosis
THERAPEUTICS
Drugs
Use of chemotherapy is largely unre ported.
Procedures
Maintain appropriate patient monitoring and support during anesthetic procedures.
Aggressive surgical resection should be attempted when possible; most salivary gland adenocarcinomas are
invasive and difficult to excise.
Radiotherapy provided good local control and prolonged survival in three reported cases.
Aggressive local resection (usually histologically incomplete) followed by adjuvant radiation can achieve local
control and long-term survival, but further studies are needed to determine the most effective treatment,
including the possible role for chemotherapy.
COMMENTS
Evaluations should be made as dictated by tumor growth; every 3 months is generally reasonable.

Pemphigus
DEFINITION AND OVERVIEW
Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune dermatoses characterized by varying degrees of ulceration, crusting, and 
 pustule and vesicle formation.
Affects the skin and sometimes mucous membranes
Types (in order of prevalence): foliaceus, vulgaris, erythematosus, and vegetans, with vulgaris being the
primary form involving the oral cavity (90 percent of patients showing oral signs)
Nearly half of patients with bullous pemphigoid will have oral lesions, frequently at the mucocutaneous
junctions
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

autoantibody deposition just above the basement membrane zone, which results in deeper ulcer formation. The
severity of the ulceration and disease is related to the depth of the autobody deposition.
Foliaceus involves autoantibody deposition in the superficial layers of the epidermis.
SIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Occurs in dogs and cats
Usually seen in middle-aged to old animals
CLINICAL FEATURES
Ulcerative lesions, erosions
Affects mucous membranes, mucocutaneous junctions (eyelids, nostrils, lips, anus, prepuce, vulva), and skin
(trunk, especially in the axillae and groin); may become generalized
Oral ulceration
Anorexia
Depression
Fever
Variable pain and pruritis
Secondary bacterial infections common
May have positive Nikolsky sign
Positive pressure applied to the edge of a lesion results in easy removal of the outer layer of the skin due
to poor cellular cohesion.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Bullous pemphigoid
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Toxic epidermal necrolysis
Drug eruption
Mycosis fungoides
Lymphoreticular neoplasia
Ulcerative stomatitis causes, candidiasis
Erythema multiforme
DIAGNOSTICS
Leukocytosis and hyperglobulinemia sometimes noted, but abnormalities uncommon
Antinuclear antibody may be weakly positive in pemphigus erythematosus only
Cytology of aspirates or impression smears of pustules or crusts—acantholytic cells and neutrophils
Biopsies of lesional or perilesional skin—acantholysis and intraepidermal clefting; microabscess or pustule
formation; surface acantholytic keratinocytes
Location of epidermal lesions varies with disease
 Pemphigus foliaceous and erythematosus have subcorneal or intragranular clefting and acantholysis.
 Pemphigus vulgaris and vegetans have suprabasilar clefting.
Such testing may demonstrate positive staining in the intercellular spaces in 50 to 90 percent of cases.

Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex
IDEFINITIONANDOVERVIEW
Cats
commonly in eosinophilic granulomas and indolent ulcers.
Dogs
eosinophilic granulomas in cats. Specific ways in which EGD differs from the syndromes affecting cats are listed
se parately throughout this chapter.
IETIOLOGY ANDPATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Genetic causes are unknown, but several reports of related affected individuals and a study of disease

ofthecomplex.
Lesions of all three syndromes may develop spontaneously and acutely.
Development of eosinophilic plaques can be preceded by periods of lethargy.
Eosinophilic plaque exhibits a hypersensitivity reaction, most often to insects (e. g., fleas, mosquitos), less
often to food or environmental allergens.
Indolent ulcers may have both hypersensitivity and genetic causes
A hypersensitivity reaction is often suspected (e.g., insect bite) in EGD.
The integument is most often affected.
Signs of the disease are visible in the oral cavity.
Eosinophilic granuloma can affect the tongue, palatine arches, and palate.

flanks also have been reported.
USIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
The true complex is restricted to cats
Sex predilection reported only for females with indolent ulcer
Age predisposition for eosinophilic plaque: 2 to 6 years old
No age predisposition reported for indolent ulcer
Predisposition for allergic disorder: 2 years old
Strong predilection in Siberian huskies (76 percent of cases)
Age predisposition: 3 years old
Typically occurs in males (72 percent of cases)
CLINICAL FEATURES
Eosinophilic granulomas exhibit a number of distinctive characteristics:
located anywhere on the body; ulcerated with a "cobblestone" or coarse pattern
Lip margin and chin swelling ("pouting")
Footpad swelling, pain, and lameness
Oral cavity ulcerations (especially on the tongue, palate, and palatine arches; see Figure 56.1)
Cats with oral lesions may be dysphagic, have halitosis, and drool.
Eosinophilic plaques also exhibit their own signalments:
Alopecic, erythematous, erosive patches and plaques
Usually in linguinal, perineal, lateral thigh, and axillary regions
Frequently moist or glistening
Lesion development may stop spontaneously in some cats, especially with the heritable form of eosinophilic
plaque.
Eig, 56-1 Eosinophilic granuloma on palate.
Indolent ulcers exhibit classically raised and indurated ulcerations confined to the upper lips adjacent to the
philtrum (see Figure 56.2).
EGD is characterized by ulcerated plaques and masses that are dark or orange.
IDIEFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Try to rule out the other diseases in the complex.
demodicosis, pyoderma, and neoplasia (especially metastatic ade-nocarcinoma and cutaneous lymphosarcma).
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete blood count (CBC)—mild to moderate eosinophilia 
FeLV and FIV—pruritic diseases have been associated with these viruses
Impression smears from lesions- large numbers of eosinophils
Comprehensive flea and insect control—assist in excluding flea or mosquito bite hypersensitivity
Food-elimination trial
 Use the new food exclusively for 8 to 10 weeks.
Reinstitute the previous diet and observe for development of new lesions.
Eig. 56-2 Indolent ulcer.
Environmental allergy (atopy)—identified by intradermal skin testing (some cases)
Inject small amounts of dilute allergens intradermally
A positive reaction (allergy) is indicated by the development of a hive or wheal at the injection site.
Note: Tests have not been validated and are not recommended over intradermal testing.
Eosinophilic plaque: severe epidermal and follicular acanthosis with eosinophilic exocytosis 
and
spongiosis; intense eosinophilic dermal infiltrate common; epidermis commonly eroded or ulcerated

Inform the client about the possible allergic or heritable causes.
Discuss the waxing and waning nature of these diseases.
Clients may choose to postpone medical intervention unless severe lesions develop.
Drugs

Alternate Therapies
reports of success
CO2 laser— may offer relief from individual or painful lesions, especially those in mouth
EGD
Cessation of therapy without recurrence common
Alternative Drugs
Megestrol acetate—2.5 to 5 mg every 2 to 7 days
Can be effective in rare cases
Not recommended because of severity of possible side effects
Patient Monitoring
Corticosteroids
Baseline and frequent hemograms
Serum chemistry profiles
Urinalyses with culture
Selective immunosuppressant drugs
Frequent hemograms (biweekly at first, then monthly or bimonthly as therapy continues) to monitor for
bone marrow suppression
Routine serum chemistry profiles and urinalyses with culture (monthly at first, then every 3 months) to
monitor for complications (renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infection)
COMMENTS
Synonyms for certain syndromes
Eosinophilic granuloma: feline collagenolytic granuloma; feline linear granuloma
Indolent ulcer: eosinophilic ulcer; rodent ulcer; feline upper lip ulcerative dermatitis
Expected Course and Prognosis
If a primary cause (allergy) can be determined and controlled, lesions should resolve permanently, unless the
animal reencounters the offending allergen.
Most lesions wax and wane, with or without therapy, thus an unpredictable schedule of recurrence should be
anticipated.
Drug dosages should be tapered to the lowest possible level (or discontinued, if possible) once the lesions have
resolved.

Chapter 57
Rodent and Lagomorph Incisor Overgrowth
IDEFINITIONANDOVERVIEW
In rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits), incisors are elodont and aradicular hypsodont teeth.
Elodont: continuously growing and erupting
Aradicular: open-rooted tooth
Hypsodont: long anatomical crown compared to the root
Incisor overgrowth occurs with excessive lengthening of the crown height, typically due to a lack of the normal
physiological attrition that would offset the continuous growth.
ETIOLOGY ANDPATHOPHYSIOLOGY
In rabbits, atraumatic malocclusion of the incisors is the most common dental problem.
Maxillary brachygnathism, autosomal recessive trait
In rodents, genetic incisor malocclusion is uncommon. Look to other causes.
Dietary influences
Inadequate roughage for attrition
Excessive selenium or deficiency of vitamin C (guinea pigs)
Impaired collagen synthesis that could impact periodontal ligament, leading to tooth mobility; mobile teeth 
can drift out of proper occlusal alignment
Incisor overgrowth may influence
Lagomorph Cheek Tooth Overgrowth).
Overgrowth may be complicated with periodontal and/or endodontic disease, which often are interrelated.
ISIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Reluctant to eat or dysphagic
Weight loss, unthrifty
Not grooming self
Bruxism: tooth grinding
Swelling or abscessation
Nasal discharge
Slobbers: excessive drooling with or without moist dermatitis(Figure 57.1 )
Eig. 57-1 "Slobbers" or wet dewlap on a rabbit due to hypersalivation.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Elongated crown or "roots" (submerged portion of crown)
Maxillary incisors may start curling into mouth with elongation
Disruption of proper occlusion
Incisor changes readily apparent 
Cheek teeth aberrations seen on further examination
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Oral mass
Oral foreign body
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete oral examination
Otoscope
Lighted bivalve speculum
Endoscopy, if available 
Radiography
 Assess apical changes; extensive root changes can lead to perforation of cortical bone or abscessation
Assess premolars and molars, occlusal surfaces
THERAPEUTICS
Drugs
Appropriate antimicrobial therapy if abscessation or slobbers present
Broad spectrum likely warranted, but limited choices
Risk of gastrointestinal flora disruption
Procedures
I reat every 3 to 6 weeks or as needed.
Use a diamond bur (with bur guard) on a high-speed handpiece, with a light touch to protect soft tissue.
Do not use a cutting disk or nail trimmers.
'aigissod h (saneuns ieeey uo aweua aou oi anpi adeus iastuo ieneu syaai aun uieia
Address dietary corrections needed (e.g., roughage, ascorbic acid).
Consider incisor extraction if it is too challenging to keep the teeth equilibrated (see Chapter 8, Extraction
Technique).
Long, curved root: surgical extraction would damage bone
 Periodontal ligament (PDL): intermediate plexus
Elevation of the PDL to fatigue the coronal aspect of the PDL often allows enough release of tooth.
Elevate carefully with small elevators; minimize rotation.
Once loose, press the tooth back into the sulcus with small rotation to extirpate the pulp completely.
Gently remove the tooth and pulp.
Incomplete extraction likely will result in regrowth of the tooth.
COMMENTS
Most cases encompass myriad conditions and complications due to the delicate balance that is disrupted.
Periodontal and endodontic problems
Abscessation
Apparent overgrowth of incisors in older patients, especially chinchillas, probably is secondary to cheek teeth
problems (see Chapter 58, Rodent and Lagomorph Cheek Tooth Overgrowth).
In rodents other than chinchillas and guinea pigs, the cheek teeth do not continually erupt, so caudal problems

Rodent and Lagomorph Cheek Tooth Overgrowth
DEFINITION AND OVERVIEW
In rabbits and some rodents (chinchillas and guinea pigs), cheek teeth—premolars and molars—are elodont
and aradicular hypsodont teeth, as are the incisors.
Elodont: continuously growing and erupting
Aradicular: open-rooted tooth
In other rodents (mice, rats, hamsters), the cheek teeth are anelodont and radicular brachyodont.
Radicular: closed root apex
Brachyodont: short crown compared to the root (similar to human teeth)
The jaws normally have an anisognathic relationship, with the maxilla wider than the mandible.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The cause of cheek tooth overgrowth is likely multifactorial, possibly a combination of genetic, dietary, and
metabolic factors.
Inadequate roughage for normal dental attrition
Excessive selenium or deficiency of vitamin C (guinea pigs)
aou gou yoon on uipeal 'uawill ieiuopoad oedui pinon ieun siauiuas uaellon paedui
teeth can drift out of proper occlusal alignment
Overgrowth may be complicated with periodontal and/or endodontic disease, which are often interrelated.
Radiographically root elongation and apical changes may occur, particularly in chinchillas.
The occlusal plane of rabbits and guinea pigs is more angled than that of chinchillas, therefore the following
 findings are generally more severe.
Overgrowth results in medial hooks of the mandibular teeth that can encompass or grow into the tongue
(tongue-tied).
ISIGNALMENT AND HISTORY
Reluctance to eat or dysphagia
Weight loss, unthrifty
Lack of grooming
Bruxism: tooth grinding
Swelling or abscessation
Nasal discharge
CLINICAL FEATURES
Elongated crown or "roots" (submerged portion of crown)
 Disruption of proper occlusion, difficulty closing mouth
Incisor overgrowth may occur secondary to cheek teeth problems.
Cheek teeth abnormalities may be seen with a closer oral exam (endoscopy simple otoscope cone; see
Figure 58.1) or radiographically

After the reduction of teeth in guinea pigs, stretched muscles may not allow for proper jaw closure.
Expected Course and Prognosis
With early detection and appropriate, regular treatment, the prognosis is fair if secondary problems can be
avoided.

Dental Home Care

Since periodontal disease is one of the most common infections in pets, it is important for you to realize what an
integral part you can play in helping to prevent the disease.

efforts, even an older pet can be taught to tolerate the care. Each pet-owner relationship is different, so we realize
that not every pet will allow having its teeth brushed daily, but we would like to encourage you to try the best you
can. By providing regular home care, you can help slow down the deposits of plaque (with bacteria) and tartar that
contribute to periodontal disease, infection, and tooth loss.

ysnugyiooi palisug-os e jo juawaaou sulysng jeinouo 'ieinsai e oi suipng uaaa pue 'fiuen
Even with the best efforts, some pets won't tolerate brushing well, and don't do anything that could cause
them to bite you or that would be overly stressful to them! Sometimes oral solutions, gels, and even waxy
materials can be applied carefully to pets' mouths to help fight periodontal disease, so determine what extent of
home care you can provide your pet, and try your best.
Remember that even with meticulous home care, this is still just one part of a complete periodontal care
program for your pet, which will also include professional periodontal cleanings when recommended by your
veterinarian. But by minimizing the amount of plaque and tartar that build up on the tooth surfaces, you can
decrease the amount of work that will be needed during those visits. Another benefit may be early detection of
examining your pet's mouth!
Recommendations:
Apply protective wax weekly

not aggressively elevate or drill out root portions that are no longer discernible. We will continue to monitor these
Rarely we will find some teeth that seem to have resorptive lesions but are causing more by the inflammation
of periodontal disease. We will be able to identify these teeth by their intact root structure on X-rays and will
remove these roots completely.
