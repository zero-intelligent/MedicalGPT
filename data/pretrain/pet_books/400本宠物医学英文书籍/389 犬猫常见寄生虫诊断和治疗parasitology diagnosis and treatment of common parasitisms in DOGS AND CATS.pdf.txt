PREFACE
The purpose of this set of Flash Cards is to provide a quick guide
to the most common parasites seen in dogs and cats, the
diseases they produce, and treatments to remove the infections.
Parasitologists tend to make keys for other parasitologists who
share a familiarity with the systematic format in which parasites
are classified. In this publication, we have collected all of the
essential information about a particular parasite on a single
review card for quick reference. The material is organized so
that information regarding the organism, its diagnostic stage,
the type of specimen required, location in the body, and
methods of control can be easily reviewed. Only those few
points of biology with a direct bearing on control are presented.
significance. No attempt is made to be all-inclusive with respect
to either pathogens that may be encountered or to treatments
that may be applied.
This information is also available as a PDA program. The plan
from the outset was to develop a set of information that could
the hand-held device will also serve as an electronic visual key to
these parasites. We think that the different search capabilities
of the PDA format will be a favorable attribute for the individual
who needs rapid access to diagnostic and treatment information
in a clinical or laboratory setting. We hope that the information
we have provided in both of these formats is what people really
do need for effective management of the commonly
encountered parasitisms ofdogs and cats.
The material evolved from a joint interest between the authors
and our editor, Carroll Cann, in developing a resource that would
work in a pocket computer format. It has been a pleasure
fruition. We have spent a good deal of time with the team at
Teton NewMedia developing various aspects of the design and
presentation. Thus, we also need to thank Cynthia Roantree,
Nicol Giandomenico, Susan Hunsberger, Anita Sykes and Sue
Haun for making this an enjoyable and productive experience.

Canine/feline hookworm common along southern Atlantic
seacoast and Caribbean. Transcutaneous infection and ingestion
Teton
of paratenic hosts.
PPP= 2 weeks.
NewMedia
Dx: Elongate, ellipsoid (60 μm
long), thin-shelled egg in feces (in
the 8-celled stage) is indistin-
guishable from Ancylostoma
caninum. Ancylostoma eggs are
smaller than Uncinaria eggs. If
eggs develop and hatch in
feces L1 (300-340μm), will have
a short esophagus with a bulb
at its base and a small genital
primordium (compare with
Strongyloides).
Adult Habitat: Small intestine.
Similar Species: Ancylostoma
caninum.
Range: Southern Atlantic seacoast
and Caribbean.
Clinical Signs: Anemia, but Ancylostoma braziliensis
causes less blood loss than Ancylostoma caninum, so
less likely to cause acute disease.
Potential Zoonosis: Cutaneous larva migrans in
the southeastern United States and Caribbean
islands.
Tx: Hookworms constantly repopulate the
intestine from larvae sequestered in tissues, so
it is possible that fecal samples collected 2
weeks after treatment will show additional
eggs. Drugs to clear the adult infections at the
labeled dose include:
Nemex TM
Panacur? Granules 22.2%

NewMedia
and radiographic findings,
markedly elevated
neutrophilia, and finding
organism on Bx of tissue.
Habitat: PMNs, schizonts in
skeletal muscle (very large
cystic form).
Similar Species: Hepatozoon
canis in other parts of the
world typically causes a

Tx: No single treatment effectively eliminates tissue stages, but
trimethoprim-sulfadiazine, clindamycin, and pyrimethamine
followed by long-term administration of decoquinate results in
extended survival times and excellent quality of life. Relapses
occur within 3 to 4 months. Palliative use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory agents (aspirin, phenylbutazone, flunixin) relieve
discomfort. Glucocorticoids give temporary improvement but,
longterm, exacerbate the disease.

Tapeworm acquired by dogs eating infected amphibians,
reptiles, birds, or small mammals.
PPP= 3 weeks.
Dx: Segment in feces (250 to 500 μm long); sometimes chains
of segments are passed. Small segments easily missed, but
identified by the eggs being
clustered in a single ball in the
middle (about 30 or s0 eggs in
the central packet, each egg
containing a larva that has 3 pairs
of small hooklets).
Adult Habitat: Small intestine.
Similar Species: There are a
number of Mesocestoides species
that have been described that
could all infect dogs including

Range: World.
Clinical Signs: Typically
asymptomatic. Occasionally,
especially in the western United
States, dogs develop severe and
life-threatening infections with
the larval stage within the peritoneal cavity which secondarily
invades other organs such as the liver There does not appear to
be any correlation between the development of the intestinal
infection and the visceral infection.

ToXoPLASMA GoNdIl
t02005TetonNewMedia
Small-sized feline coccidian acquired by eating oocyst or
infected meat of bird or mammal.
PPP= 3 to 18 days; longer when infection via eating of oocyst.
Dx: 0ocysts (11 to 13 μm long) in
feces, clear, unsporulated spheroid
Habitat: Small intestinal mucosa.
Similar Species: Cannot
distinguish oocyst from that of
Hammondia hammondi.
Range: World.
Clinical Signs: Intestinal infection
usually asymptomatic. Cats can develop
severe generalized disease and ocular
lesions; such disease not necessarily
related to shedding of oocysts in feces.
Potential Zoonosis: Oocysts not infectious when
passed in feces, but sporulate rapidly (24 hours) under
appropriate conditions. Thus, cats shedding oocysts
morphologically consistent with Toxoplasma gondff
should either be housed in clinic to protect client or
started on treatment to try and reduce shedding.
Tx: Once oocysts appear in feces, most of the
damage from development in the mucosa has already
occurred. Sulfonamides are the drugs of choice:
sulfadiazine plus 5-10 mg trimethoprim/kg, P0, q12h for
6 days; cats over 4 kg)
Albon? (sulfadimethoxine; 50 mg/kg, PO, once, then
27.5 mg/kg, P0, q24h until signs disappear)
