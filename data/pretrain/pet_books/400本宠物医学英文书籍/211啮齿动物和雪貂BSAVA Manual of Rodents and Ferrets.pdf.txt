Syrian hamstershavebilateral pigmented seba-
ceous glands (flank glands;Figure 1.3),which are
more prominent in male animals,particularly when
sexually aroused.Dwarf hamsterspossess a ventral
scent gland (Figure 1.4).The scent glands are involved
in territorial marking and mating behaviour.

The habitat of the Mongolian gerbil undergoes
wide temperature variations and gerbils have adapted
to tolerate these temperature extremes.The Harderian

High cholesterol levels are thought to be a conse-

differences in liver enzymes involved in cholesterol
metabolism. The gerbil's red blood cells have
extremely short life spans (10 days) and consequently
show pronounced basophilic stippling on blood
smears. See also Chapter 4.
Guinea pigs
Guinea pigs possess sebaceous glands along the
dorsum, rump and perianal area which are involved in
territorial marking. Despite having no tail, guinea pigs
do have four to six coccygeal vertebrae.The tympanic
bullae are large.The front feet each have four digits
and the hind feet have three.The gastrointestinal

Guinea pigs
The domestic guinea pig (Cavia aperea f.porcellus)
belongs to the familyCaviidaein therodentsuborder
Hystricomorpha. This family contains 18 species,
including Patagonian hares (or maras) and capybara.
Guinea pigs were domesticated approximately
3,000-6,000 years ago,probably from their wild
ancestor the cavy (Cavia aperea).They were
introduced to Europe by the Spaniards in the mid
16th century.
Wild cavies arecommonly found inSouthAmerica
and inhabit variable terrains such as savanna,
brushland andmountainous regions of the Andes.
They are crepuscular/nocturnal and live incoloniesof

History and physical examination
History
A comprehensive signalment and history is critical in
the determination of the disease process and often
may help to determine the exact aetiology of the
presenting complaint. Often the history can be

endotracheal tubes of 1.0-2.5 mm internal diameter
(ID) are most often needed for small rodent species.

fast is contraindicated because they are small animals

Ovariectomy:In myomorph rodents,ovariectomy
(without removing the uterus) is commonly performed
through a lumbar approach (Jenkins,2000;Bennett
and Mullen,2004a).The patient is placed in ventral
recumbency and the dorsal lumbar and flank areas
are clipped and prepared for aseptic surgery.A single
dorsal incision ismadeapproximately at the third
lumbar vertebra (Figure 7.13) or,alternatively,a
transverse incision can be made on each side.The
skin incisionon the dorsum is shifted from one side
to the other to gain access to each ovary.Following
skin incision,blunt dissection is used caudal to the

Enucleation refers to the removal of the globe
along with the nictitating membrane (in species that
have one) and the eyelid margins. There are two vari-
ations. In transconjunctival enucleation the bulbar
conjunctiva is incised at the limbus and the globe is
removed through this incision. In transpalpebral
enucleation the eyelids are sutured together and
the skin around the eyelid margins is incised to the
bulbar conjunctiva.The globe is removed without

superficial scabs and are non-pruritic; others are pru-
ritic and can result in self-mutilation. Focal areas of
alopecia orulceration aregenerallyover theneck and

have improved. Respiratory disease is one of the
most commonproblems encountered inpetmice and

guinea pigs Bordetella bronchiseptica is the most
commonrespiratorypathogen.Respiratory diseaseis

Common respiratory diseases
Infectious diseases
Infectious respiratory disease is common in rats and
guinea pigs but rare in gerbils and degus. Bacterial
respiratory infections arereported to be the second
most common type of infection inhamsters.However,
hamsters seem to be more resistant to infectious
respiratory disease than other rodents and only a
few cases are seen in the clinical situation, in the
author's experience.
Some of the causal bacteria are opportunist
pathogens,such as Bordetellainrats.Otherinfections,
such as mycoplasmosis, are acquired and animals
remain infected for life.Inadequate housing conditions

Degus
Althoughdegushavebeenwell studied in laboratory
research,information is very limited for pets.Degus
rarelypresentwith urogenital disorders,butsome are
being observed more frequently in practice.
Urinary diseases
Diabetic nephropathy
Diabetic nephropathy is well described in laboratory
degus(see Chapter 16).Degus develop spontane-
ous diabetesmellitus and isletamyloidosis(Murphy
et al.,1980).A characteristic clinical sign is cataract
formation(Figure 13.7).Predisposing factors include
an improper diet,such as fruits and pelleted diets
high in sugar. Diagnosis can be made by serum
chemistry profile,ultrasonography and demonstra-
tion of glucosuria on urinalysis.Renal architecture
can be observed on ultrasonography. Treatment
includes dietary modification (high-protein, low-fibre,
low-fat,no-sugarrat diet;vegetablesinsteadof fruit
and supportive care. Sorbinil,an aldose reductase
inhibitor,has been used in treating and preventing
diabetic nephropathy and cataract formation, but it is
currently not available in the United States or in the
UK (Datules,1989).Diabetic degus have higher
aldose reductase activity.This enzyme is involved in

Disorders associated with nutritional
deficiencies and excesses
Vitamin Cdeficiency
Guinea pigs cannot endogenously synthesize vitamin
C (L-ascorbic acid) as they lack the gene that controls
productionof L-gulonolactone oxidase thuspreventing
the conversion ofL-gulonolactone to ascorbic acid.

Lacrimal production
Measurement of lacrimal production is alsopossible
in chinchillas and guinea pigs using the conventional
6mm-wide Schirmer teartest(STT) strips(see Figure
15.4b). Normal parameters for STT for chinchillas are
quite similar to those of other small animals,at 20.00
±7.8mm/minute (Montiani-Ferreira,2001).On the
other hand,in guinea pigs,in the author's experience
theresultsforSTTs arequite lowwitha greatvariance
(around 2.5 ±2.0 mm/minute).
For practical purposes, the traditional Schirmer
test filter paper strip can be cut in half lengthwise to3
mm for smaller species. This procedure makes STT
possible in small rodents with small conjunctival sacs,
such as gerbils, mice and hamsters.Furthermore, the
a
procedure results in a longer length of wetted strip
length,improving the margin of error of the test.
However,normal values using thistechnique havenot
been established.
Examination for associated conditions
In addition to the largenumber ofprimary conditions
the eye may develop,it may also show changes
secondary to systemic abnormalities.A thorough
examination of the eyemayprove tobe a valuable
step in investigating systemic disease.For instance,
eye discharge can be associated with respiratory
diseases,and enophthalmic (shrunken) eyes can be
associatedwith dehydration.

for conjunctivitis should always be treated along with
the ocular signs.A broad-spectrum antibiotic such as
tripleantibiotic ophthalmic solution(neomycin-
bacitracin-polymyxin) or trimethoprim-polymyxin eye
drops should be instilled every 6 hours.

flanks and rump and will diminish and resolve if fur-
therbreeding is delayed and the animal's condition
(i.e.health and husbandry) is improved. If repeated
breeding with mating at postpartum oestrus occurs,
this condition is likely to progress.

This condition has recently been described in a
4-year-old female guinea pig, associated with bilat-
eral symmetricalalopecia,polydipsia,weightloss and
bilateral exophthalmos (Zeugswetter et al.,2007).

the examination. Ferrets rarely resent this, but it

anti-inflammatory drug for up to 7 days, depending on
severity of injury or surgical incision. Chronic pain, as
seen with neoplasia, may need long-term pain control
that the owner may need to administer based on
clinical signs. The clinician needs to educate the
owner on signs of pain in their ferret and what the
different medications will do, as well as work out
dosage and frequency schedules.Many owners are
in tune with their ferrets and can become astute in
recognizing the subtle signs of pain. They are very
willing to provide pain control to keep their ferret

but lateral saphenous, jugular and intraosseous
catheters can also be used.
When a juguiar catheter is necessary,a 22 gauge
venous catheter can be placed in the jugular vein. In
many ferrets a cut-down to expose the jugular vein for
catheter placement may be necessary, as the neck

Premedication
Ferrets have a strong vagal reflex and may also
demonstrate arrhythmias and apnoea inresponse to
gaseous anaesthesia.In addition,because of strong
and subsequent histamine release, and in many
ferrets pre-existing Gl ulceration, the author has found

veterinary practice.[Editors’note:Recent research
indicates that surgical neutering plays a role in the
development of hyperadrenocorticism(see also
Chapters 17 and 30).]
Anal sacculectomy
Similar to other members of Mustelidae,a unique
anatomical featureofferrets is thepresence ofwell
developed anal sacs,located in the perianal space
lateral tothedistalrectum.Theyarevery largerelative
to the size of the animal. The oily yellowish secretion
stored in the sacs from the perianal glands has a very
musky and pungent odour,which can be a concern
when ferrets are kept as pets. The primary indication
for bilateral anal sacculectomy is toeliminate the
odour when secretions are expressed,especially
indoors.Anal sac abscessation occasionally occurs in
ferrets that have not been de-scented; therefore this
represents a therapeuticprocedure as well.
However, this preventive surgery is considered
unethical and is not permitted in the UK or in The
Netherlands. It is rarely done in general practice in
the US,as anal sacculectomy is usuallyperformed
with surgical neutering prior to arrival at pet stores. In
other countries, it is a common procedure performed
at the age of puberty, concurrently with neutering or
spaying. Neutering or spaying will not cause atrophy
of the anal glands or the anal sacs and the tendency
of ferrets to express the anal sac secretion is related
to behavioural and environmental factors.
Two different surgical techniques are reported for
preventive anal sacculectomy of the ferret.Forboth
techniques the ferret can be placed inventral or dor-

Surgical treatment of salivary mucocele
The anatomy of salivary glands in the ferret is well
reported in the literature (Fox,1998).Among the five
pairs of salivary glands (in craniocaudal direction:
zygomatic,buccal, sublingual, parotid, mandibular),
some can occasionally be affected by salivary
mucocele (Figure 23.25).Pathophysiology is often
related to trauma involving the duct of the salivary
gland. Typical presentation is a large unilateral cold
side of the face, unless the zygomatic gland is involved.
Differential diagnosis includes abscessation (possibly
related to dental disease) and a fine-needle aspirate is

study,vaccination had not previously been associated
with oncogenesis in non-feline species. Wide and
deep surgical excision, possibly followed by local
radiation, is indicated (Antinoff and Hahn, 2004)
The convention is still to administer vaccines
subcutaneously in the interscapular region. Although
the number of reports of sarcomas is very small, it
maybe more prudent togivevaccinessubcutaneously

Clinical history
A detailed history is needed to determine a course of

frequency of faeces,and the durationfor which the

including breeder,mayplay a significant role in the
priority of aetiologies.Other information should

treats),toys available and incidental environmental
information (such as access to showers or sinks)

DCM should be suspected in any ferret with
cardiomegaly on radiography or evidence of CHF,
such as pulmonary oedema or pleural effusion.A
definitive diagnosis is based on echocardiographic
findings. Ferrets with DCM have a large and often
spherical leftventricularchamberwith thin wallsand
depressed wall motion.The left atrium may be
enlarged (one would expect significant enlargement
with CHF),and the right atrium and ventricle may be
affected as well.
A histopathological study of a ferret with DCM
showed multifocal myocardial degeneration,myo-
cardial necrosis and replacement fibrosis (Lipman et

Lymphoma
Lymphoma is a common condition in ferrets and may
metastasize to the vertebrae and cause osteolytic
lesions and hind limb paresis(see Chapter 30 for
further details).
Osteoma
Osteomas of the skull of ferrets present as firm hard

Ophthalmia neonatorum
Some neonatal ophthalmic disorders have also been
reported, the most common of them probably being
ophthalmia neonatorum. This condition occurs when
microorganisms proliferate at the corneoconjunctival
surface before the eyelids open,causing an
accumulation of ocular discharge in the conjunctival
sac. The eyelids appear distended, with or without
exterior drainage.Oftenmore than one individual in a
a
litteris affected.
In general, this disease is diagnosed in kits aged a
few days to 3 weeks old. In most cases the condition
is not noticed until the accumulation of infectious
exudate causes the eyelid to bulge. Several micro-
organisms may cause this condition but bacterial
infection is probably the most common.Although
details of the route for infection have not yet been
confirmed,Escherichia colimastitis in the jill appears
to contribute to the formation of ophthalmia neonat-
orum in kits.
Regardless of the causative organism or route of
infection, ophthaimia neonatorum should be treated
by manually or surgically opening the adhered eyelids

BSAvA Manual of
Rodents and Ferrets
Edited by Emma Keeble and Anna Meredith
ThisnewBSAVA Manual is a response to the
increased number of rodents and ferretskept as
petsand the demandfor appropriate veterinary
care for these patients,whose small size,
natural life expectancy present challenges to the
veterinary surgeon.
The Manual covers the most commonly encountered rodent species-mice,
rats,hamsters,gerbils,guinea pigs,chinchillas and degus-in detail,as well as
species.In recognition of thevery fundamental differencesbetween therodent
group of species and ferrets, the book is presented in two distinct sections. Both
rodent and ferret sections begin with the all-important biology,husbandry and
clinical techniques(including anaesthesia and surgery),followedby chapters on
common diseases organized by clinical system.A
useful appendixsummarizes the differential diagnoses
based on clinical signs in rodents, and in ferrets.
High-quality colour images and numerous
quick-reference tables accompany and amplify
the text,whichhasbeenwritten by an international
fieldof contributing authorswith extensive
practical experience.
