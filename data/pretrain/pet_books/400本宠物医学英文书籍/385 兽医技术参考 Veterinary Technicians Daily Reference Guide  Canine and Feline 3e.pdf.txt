Skill Box 2.1 / Cardiac Examination
Cardiac Examination
Technique
 Perform auscultation in a quiet room with a calm patient. Place the patient in a standing or sitting position. Avoid listening to recumbent animals as the change in heart
position and configuration leads to errors. The flat diaphragm of the stethoscope is used to detect high-frequency sounds (e.g., normal heart and breath sounds, most
murmurs), while the bell is used to detect lower-frequency sounds (e.g., third and fourth heart sounds, diastolic murmurs). The entire heart is examined, paying particular
attention to the cardiac valves. Begin by placing the diaphragm gently but firmly at the left apex, where the first heart sound is best heard and also the location of the
mitral valve (found on the left lateral thorax between the fourth and sixth intercostal space, behind the olecranon). From here, inch the stethoscope to the left base of the
heart, which is approximately two rib spaces cranial and slightly dorsal. Note the second heart sound and possible aortic and pulmonic stenosis murmurs. Next, palpate
the same area on the right lateral thorax and move the stethoscope to this region. This is the tricuspid region and possible location of tricuspid regurgitation. Then move to
the right base of the heart and observe for subaortic stenosis. Once an abnormality is noted, the surrounding region should be evaluated to find the point of the loudest 
sound. In this process, the entire heart region should be evaluated and a complete examination performed.

appropriate-sized cone for the patient. For ease of examination, the patient should be placed on a table or large canines in a siting position. The head should be held
in such a manner to avoid crushing the ear canal while directing the muzzle toward the thoracic inlet. Holding the pinna up and out from the base of the skull will
allow straightening of the ear canal. Gently insert the otoscope into the extermal ear canal and slowly advance while observing the canal. As the cone enters the vertical
canal, the pinna is pulled up and over the otoscope while the otoscope handle is rotated to a hori zontal position. The tympanic membrane will then be visualized in a
normal ear as a white translucent membrane. Any abnormalities such as inflammation, redness, exudate, foreign objects, mites, or tumors should be noted.

Skill Box 2.6 / Neurological Examination
 Neurological Examination
Technique
 The neurological exam begins as the patient walks into the examination room. Notice should be paid to the patient's body posture (e.g., head ti lt), attitude (e.g..
demented, semicomatose, disoriented), gait (e.g., inability or abnormal walk, dragging limbs, circling), and purposeful movement (e.g., attempt to move down limbs). This
exam also includes a thorough palpation of the animal's body (e.g., symmetry, worn toenails, ↑ or ↓ muscle tone, masses).

 Postural Reactions
The patient's ability to recognize an abnormal position and to change its position to bear weight and be able to walk. These assess the integrity of the nervous system but
do not localize the specific area of the nervous system involved. Postural reactions need to be evaluated in conjunction with all aspects of a patient's exam and
diagnostics. As these tests are assessing the same pathways, it is the clinician's preference in the selection of which of these tests to perform, dependent on the animal's
 issues, temperament, and tolerance factors.

 Orthopedic Examination 
Technique
+ Similar to the neurological examination, the orthopedic examination begins as the patient enters the examination room. Notice should be paid to the patient's
conformation, stance, sitting, standing, rising, and gait. The examination should continue with a hands-on evaluation of the area of concern, including the alternate
 side. A systematic approach should be used to cover the entire limb, often beginning distally and moving proximally. Alterations in the range of motion and rotation 
should be noted along with any crepitus, clicking, clunking, instability, swelling, muscle atrophy or overdevelopment, and pain. Begin the examination by evaluating
the nonaffected joint to assess the patient's normal response to manipulation and pressure.

 Table 3.1 / Body Condition Scoring System
Part of evaluating the pet is to perform a complete physical exam and to assess the BCs. The body condition scoring system standardizes the interpretation of the overal
physical appearance of the animal. It is an evaluation of body fat and should be a basic part of every examination and noted in the record for future comparison. This
technique can be easily and quickly taught to clients as part of weight management at home. There are two scales that are most often used, a 1-5 scale and a 1-9 scale,
with 1 being very thin or emaciated and 5 or 9 being extremely overweight. The 1-5 BCS chart is referenced below. A BCS change by one value is an estimated 10%
change in body weight.

Skill Box 3.1 / Daily Caloric Requirement Worksheet for a Healthy Animal
Many factors affect the energy requirements of animals. Understanding these factors may prevent an animal from becoming obese. Daily caloric
requirements are altered by the physiological state (e.g., adult maintenance, pregnancy, lactation, and growth), activity level, temperament,
environmental temperature, and the diet's digestibility. The calculations that follow provide a starting point, but adjustments will need to be made based
on each individual animal.
Step 1: Calculate the daily resting energy requirement (RER):
RER = 70×(current body weight in kg)0.75 = 
kcal/ day
or, for animals weighing between 2 and 30kg,
RER = (30 xcurrent body weight in kg) + 70 =
kcal/day.

PREVENTATIVE CARE
Skill Box 3.1 / Daily Caloric Requirement Worksheet for a Healthy Animal (Continued)
Adjust the kilocalorie based on visual and manual examinations and the BCS of the animal
Tip: To calculate the RER without a scientific caleulator, multiply the weight (in kilogram) by itself three times, then take the square root twice and multiply by 70.
Step 2: Calculate the daily energy requirement (DER) by multiplying the RER by the life stage factor:
DER =(RERx _-
_ life stage factor} = -

* Twenty-five percent of the RER should be provided for each pup in adition to the Damm's DER.
These calculations do not consider the type of breed and their differences in growth requirements. Adjust the kilocalorie based on visual and manual
examinations of the animal.
Step 3: Calculate the volume of food required:
kcal/day÷
kcal/cup or can of food
cup/ can of food/day.
 The kilocalorie of the diet can be found on the bag by contacting the manufacturer or by following the next equation.
Step 4: Calculate the amount of each feeding:
 cup/ can of food/day ÷ two to three feedings per day
 cup/ can of food/feeding.
 Dogs: Energy requirements typically decrease 18-24% in older dogs.
Cats: Energy requirements drop in a mature cat but rise again around the age of 10-12 years.
Note: The majority of pet owners treat their pets. Pet owners feel a connection through treating their pet and studies show owners believe treating is a way to connect with their pet and to
demonstrate love for the pet. This strengthens the Mman-animal bond. Technicians must address this during the mutritional history to find out the type of treat, the amount of treat, and potential
persons involved in treating. It is OK for owners to treat as long as the health-care team realizes and calculates the treat calories into the DER. Treats should not constitute more than l0% of

Table 3.2 / General Life Stage Feeding Guidelines
Each stage of an animal's life presents changes in nutritional needs. The overall goal of nutrition is to obtain an optimum BCS (see Table 3.1, Body Condition Scoring
System, page 67) while providing the correct balance of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Regardless of the particular life stage, the nutritional health of the animal is 
ultimately made by visual evaluation and physical examination to determine the feeding guidelines for each animal.

Skill Box 3.5 / Estimating and Comparing Calorie Count Worksheet
Once the daily energy requirement has been established, the amount of food required per day is calculated based on the particular diet. AAFCO
guidelines do not require the calorie content to be listed on the packaging, which makes comparing the calorie content of different food products
difficult. This information can often be found by calling the manufacturer, but at times, this is cumbersome and time intensive. As an alternative, the
following calculations can be done to achieve an estimate for the total calorie count. The exact calorie count cannot be established since the data used
 are the minimum and maximum and are not exact percentages.

Adjustment
 Enteral nutrition is the preferred way of providing nutrition. Providing nutri-
tion to some portion of the gastrointestinal tract allows for the health and
integrity of the tract to remain. Prolonged periods of nonuse contribute to
 its mucosal barrier failure and systemic bacterial contamination. Patients that
are umable or umwilling to eat at least 85% of their RER but are able to digest
and absorb nutrients in the small intestines should be provided nutrition by
this route. Depending on the patient's medical condition, there are many
options for providing enteral nutrition.
 Note: The French (Fr) umit measures the outer diameter of a tube with
each Fr equally 0.33 mm.

Procedure
Administer general anesthesia and place the patient in right lateral recumbency. Aseptically prepare the lateral midcervical area from the ramus of the
mandible to the thoracic inlet and dorsally and ventrally to midline. Place a mouth speculum and slightly extend the neck. Measure the tube from the
point of exit (midcervical region) to the seventh or eighth intercostal space and mark with a permanent marker. Place carmalt forceps down the
esophagus to the point of insertion and make an incision over the tips. Place the tube into the tips of the forceps and withdraw out the mouth. (The
tube can also be placed using the Eld"* feeding tube placement device; make an incision through the cervical musculature and place the tube into the
esophagus according to manufacturer's guidelines.) Secure the exterior end of the tube and then using the carmalt, stylet, or fingers push the tube
down the esophagus until the proximal end of the tube flips rostrally when the tube is in place. Suture the tube to the cervical skin using the Chinese
finger trap. An antibiotic ointment is used and a gauze bandage is placed. Radiograph (lateral and VD) to verify proper placement.
Complications
● Inadvertent tube removal by vomiting: pawing. or chewing the end
+ Distal esophageal trauma due to large-bore tubes, reflux, or excessively heated foods
+ Peristomal infection and cellulitis
● Incorrect placement with feeding into axilla or subcutaneous tissues
Removal
● Immediate or up to several months
+ To remove, cut the skin sutures and pull.
+ The exit site does not need further care; the holes will seal in 1-2 days and heal in 7-10 days.
Tip: The tip of the feeding tube can be cut at the distal end just above the holes to allow a larger diameter for the food to exit to prevent clogging. Verify the cut end does not have sharp edges

Interpretation
 Once a slide has been evaluated, the results should confirm an inflammatory
 Or neoplastic process. The distinction of inflammation alone often will enable
the veterinarian to determine an initial treatment plan. If the slide is found
to have neoplastic cells, they are then reviewed against the criteria of malig-
nancy. Often the results are sent to a cytology laboratory for confrmation
and staging.

Skill Box 4.5 / Buffy Coat Evaluation
The buffy coat is the small, white layer found between plasma and red blood cells on a centrifuged sample of whole blood. The layer afloat the red
blood cells contains mostly WBCs and some platelets. An additional white layer above the previous layer contains the majority of platelets. Visualization
of this layer is often only seen with a microscope. Evaluation of the buffy coat is useful for mast cell tumor staging, hematopoietic neoplasia, some

Table 4.7 / Effusion Cytology
Effusions are the excessive accumulations of fluid in a body cavity (pleural, peritoneal, pericardial). These cavities naturally have a small amount of fluid present, but with
an increase in volume, they become an effusion and are classified as either transudate (noninflammatory) or exudate (inflammatory). Normal fluid contains low numbers 
 of mesothelial cells and few inflammatory cells. Mesothelial cells have round, centrally located, and uniformly granulated nuclei. Their cytoplasm is abundant and
basophilic and they have an eosinophilic peripheral border. The occasional inflammatory cell is similar morphologically to those found in peripheral blood. In effusions,
neutrophils (canines) and Iymphocytes (felines) are the most common leukocyte found.

predominant bacteria may indicate it as a pathogenic organism and a bacte-
rial culture should be pursued. Some conditions may have more than one
predominant bacteria (e.g., malabsorption, maldigestion). The presence of
small numbers of epithelial cells may be found in normal animals. However,
the presence of neutrophils or eosinophils may indicate inflammatory
disease [e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter sp., eosinophilic colitis). Fecal cytol-
ogy may also reveal protozoal (e.g., Giardia) or fungal (e.g., Histoplasma sp.)
or ganisms.

Vaginal Cytology
Vaginal cytology is used in evaluating an animal's stage of estrus cycle.
Because of the constant changing of cellular structures during the estrus
cycle, the evaluation of vaginal cells should be done every few days and in
conjunction with a thorough medical history and examination (e.g., multiple,
sequential samples increase accuracy of estrus stage estimation).

Reticulocytes
 Not until polychromatophilic erythrocytes are stained with a Wright stain are they termed reticulocytes. These cells are large, anucleate cells containing RNA stained with
a supravital stain (e.g., NMB). The RNA appears as blue intracellular granules. In canines, all reticulocytes are accounted for; however, in felines there are two types of 
reticulocytes, and they should be counted and reported separately. Felines have aggregate reticulocytes and punctuate reticulocytes. Aggregate reticulocytes resemble
canine reticulocytes and have distinct dark clumps of blue granules and would appear as polychromatophilic erythrocytes with Wright stain. Punctuate erythrocytes have
 individual scattered blue granules with no clumping and would appear as macrocytic mature red blood cells with Wright stain. When performing a reticulocyte count,
 only aggregate reticulocytes are counted as they are the best indicator of regenerative anemia. An ↑ in reticulocytes is expected 2-4 days after blood loss or destruction.
A count >60,000 cells/μL indicates regenerative anemia and a count <60,000 cells/μL indicates a nonregenerative response. See Figure 4.61 and Figure 4.66.

RBC Morphology and Alterations
The normal morphology of a canine RBC is a large, biconcave disk (7.5 μm)
of umiform size with central pallor. A normal feline RBC is a slightly smaller
biconcave disk (5 μm) with only a slight central pallor. When observing the
prepared slide for RBC morphology, the cells should be evaluated for altera-
tions in size, shape, color, and inclusions.

Table 4.14 / WBC Alterations
When performing a WBC count, the cells should also be evaluated for alterations in size, shape, color, and inclusions. These changes can be attributed to the
inflammatory process, genetic disorders, viruses, or parasites.During an inflammatory response, the bone marrow releases neutrophils at an accelerated rate causing
morphological changes. These changes are termed toxic change and are seen in the neutrophil cytoplasm with their presence usually indicating acute, systemic
inflammation. The changes can be cytoplasmic basophilia or vacuolation, Dohle bodies, and toxic granulation. The degree of toxic change is noted as marked, moderate,
mild, and slight. Moderate and marked changes are often associated with endotoxemia from bacterial infections, while mild changes can be seen with a variety of disease
processes and slight changes may be a normal finding in a cat.

· Venipuncture should be atraumatic while using the largest vein
 possible.
· Catheterized veins should not be used due to potential heparin
contamination.
● Drawn blood should come into contact with the tube additive as soon
 as possible.
· The following tubes will give invalid results and should not be used: LTT,
GRNTT, and SST.
· Spun samples that are hemolyzed or have visible clots should be redrawn.

Blood Transfusions
Skill Box 4.11 / Crossmatching
Crossmatching determines the compatibility between donor and recipient blood. This procedure will identify incompatibilities that are not identified on
blood typing since blood typing only identifies the most common types. However, crossmatching will not pick up low titer antibodies, WBC antigens,
 and will not identify incompatibilities to DEA 1 blood types umless previous sensitization (e.g, prior transfusion history) has occurred. Crossmatching is
not a substitute for blood typing; both procedures must be performed on every patient (especially felines).

 DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS
Skill Box 4.12 / Blood Typing
Specific blood types have been identifed for both canines and felines. A blood type is determined by the genetic markers found on the surface of the
RBCs. These markers are antigenic, which allows the immune system to recognize them and potentially produce antibodies against them. These
antibody reactions can be life threatening and therefore blood typing is a critical step before administering a blood transfusion (see Table 8.20, Feline
 Blood Types, page 524).

Numerous types of culture media are available; however, most veterinary clinics use only a few. Samples should ideally be inoculated on both a solid media and a liquid
media. A solid media allows for isolation and differentiation of normal flora and pathogens and a rough bacterial count. Liquid media allows for the growth of small
numbers of bacteria.
The more extensive cultures are sent to reference laboratories for growth and interpretation.

Skill Box 4.15 / Staining Solutions and Procedures
 The frst step to identification of microbiology slides is to properly prepare the slide. Staining of slides is often done on an air-dried or heat-fixed slide.
 To heat fix a slide, make several rapid passes of the bottom of the slide over a flame source (e.g., matches, lighter, or Bunsen burner). While the slide is
immersed in staining solution, it should be agitated to allow fresh stain to remain in contact with its surface.

Urine Collection, Handling, Storage, and Transport Tips
Collection
· Collection before administration of any medication, if possible
● Morning, preprandial samples offer the most accurate specific gravity,
pH, and cellular components but allow for the degeneration of casts
overnight in the bladder.
· Collection containers must have a tight ftting lid, be dean, well rinsed,

collection.
Handling
· Samples should be covered immediately to avoid pH changes and
contamination.
● Samples with a delay of examination of >1 hour should be refrigerated;
 delay in examination can lead to changes in all aspects of urinalysis.
· Thoroughly mix a sample before examination.
● Slowly warm refrigerated samples up to room temperature before exami-
 nation and, likewise, allow urine to cool down to room temperature after
collection.

Bacteria
Bacteria are not normally found in properly collected normal urine samples. Its presence with WBCs often indicates a bacterial infection, whereas the absence of WBCs
typically indicates a contaminated sample (e.g., hair coat, container). A sample properly collected via cystocentesis or catheterization should be sterile and any presence
of bacteria is significant. Examined under high power and reported as rare through 4+. See Figure 4.123, Figure 4.124, and Figure 4.125.

Blood Cells
 Blood cells are classified by number per high-power field (#/hpf). Blood cells are thought to always be significant unless reviewed against other factors affecting the
animal. For example, an animal with only a few RBCs and no other abnormalities may have received trauma through a catheterization or cystocentesis procedure. WBCs
are always thought to be significant because they typically only appear with some level of an infection, unless contamination of infected genitalia takes place. WBCs do
not need to be classified into type; by the time they reach the bladder, they have degenerated to an unrecognizable state. The presence of WBCs should always result in
an in-depth look for bacteria.

Casts
 Casts, consisting of a mucoprotein matrix, are formed in the lumen of the distal and collecting tubules of the kidneys. Because of this location, they are all cylindrical with
parallel sides and rounded to blunted ends. Cast morphology is susceptible to high-speed centrifugation, rough handling, and delayed analysis (degrade in alkaline urine
or when allowed to sit for long periods). The presence of ↑ numbers of casts may indicate tubular disease, but the quantity does not suggest the duration or severity of

Epithelial Cells
Squamous and transitional epithelial cells are seen commonly in the urine of normal animals. Squamous epithelial cells are the largest of the epithelial cells and are
considered insignificant. Transitional epithelial cells only prove to be significant with a large increase in number. Renal epithelial cells, however, are typically only seen

However, this still may not produce a radiograph with the contrast and
(BCS), breed, and disease condition can produce the desired quality of
density needed for a quality image. There are many factors that affect the
radiograph.
Table 5.3 / Exposure Evaluation
To determine if an X-ray needs to be adjusted, one must first be able to evaluate the quality of a film. There are some basic guidelines to a properly exposed image, but
there is also veterinarian preference. Begin by evaluating the overall appearance (e.g., too light or too dark) of the X-ray. With film images, one quick assessment is while
viewing the X-ray on a standard viewing box, place your hand under the image. If you are able to see your fingers, yet not the wrinkles and creases, the image has the
correct exposure. If you are not able to see your fingers, the image is overexposed (too dark), and if you can see your fingers and all wrinkles and creases, the image is
underexposed (too light) If it is determined that an image is too light or too dark, further evaluations need to take place to determine why.

DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS
Density Evaluation
The density of a flm is the degree of blackness and is mostly controlled by
mAs. Begin evaluating the density by determining the degree of blackness.
The area outside the patient's body and inside the collimated area should be
 black. Lighter shades would indicate an increase in density is needed.

The scale of contrast is the shades of grays or the degree of blacks and whites and is mostly controlled by kVp. A kVp seting that is too high will give a lack of contrast,
(e.g., overall gray appearance). A kVp setting that is too low will give a high contrast, (e.g., strong blacks and whites).
Once a radiograph has been evaluated and it is determined that alterations are needed, the decision needs to be made as to what settings need to be altered.
settings. In general, mAs is altered by 25-50% to make large overall changes and to alter the density (degree of blackness). kVp is altered by 10-15% to make small subtle
changes and to alter the scale of contrast.
Altering the kVp by 10-15% is approximately the same change in exposure as altering the mAs by 50% (e.g., halving or doubling the mAs). Therefore, with proper
exposure and the need to only change the contrast, the kVp and mAs must be altered together in the opposite direction (e.g., ↑ kVp and ↓ mAs).

With radiology experience, adjustments to the mAs and kVp can be made prior to the first X-ray taken. There are certain anatomical factors (e.g., body weight, muscle
mass, hair coat) that are known to alter the image based on the technique chart. The technique chart is based on an "average" animal and alteration for normal often.

DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS
Radiographic Contrast Studies
Contrast studies are done in cases in which the area of concern cannot be
viewed diagnostically from the survey radiographs. The contrast provides the
veterinarian with a more thorough observation of the affected area. Many of
the procedures listed in the following tables are to be performed by a veteri-
narian only. However, the tables are provided so the technician can be ready
for the procedure and can efficiently assist the veterinarian throughout the
procedure. Patient preparation is of extreme importance, and the animal
should always be clean and dry for these procedures. In some cases, an enema
and fasting may be required so that the gastrointestinal tract is clear of food
or feces that could superimpose or distort the anatomic images. The techni-

cian should be aware of the possible side effects from the contrast medium
rib.
and be prepared for appropriate emergency procedures. Preparation for these
procedures as well as the dosage of the contrast medium should always be
reviewed with the veterinarian before the procedure. Positive mediums are
radiopaque and negative mediums are radiolucent.

 DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS
Additional Imaging Techniques
In addition to radiographs, the following modalities can be used to further
assist in the diagnosis of a patient's medical problem. Survey radiographs
should always be evaluated before any of these modalities.

Table 5.12 / Ultrasonography
Procedure
Definition
Cross-sectional computer-generated images created by the reflection of high-frequency sound waves
Technique
The ultrasound probe produces a high-frequency sound wave that is emited into the patient. The sound wave reflects off body structures and 
returns to the probe and a computer-generated image is created.
Indications
● Used to primarily evaluate soft tissue structures of the head/neck region, thorax/heart, abdomen, and musculoskeletal (joints and tendons)
Specialized Equipment
+Ultrasound machine
*Appropriate transducers (e.g., 5, 7.5-MHz transducers)
+Ultrasound gel
 Precautions
● Artifacts on examination can lead to misleading information and an incorrect diagnosis or treatment (experience of operator critical)
Notes
+Sedation if necessary for anxious or fractious patients
● Owners should be made aware that a large area of fur may be clipped
+ Wipe probe clean of gel as soon as possible
● Wash transducer probe with cold water (do not immerse) and dry with a soft towel

3.1
If right-handed, it is usually easiest to hold the transducer in the right hand and to use the lef hand to make control panel adjustments.
4.[
Dim the room lighting to reduce reflections from the screen and to enhance visualization of the image.
 5. Choose the highest frequency transducer possible for the patient and area under examination. This provides the best resolution but also limits the depth of penetration
of the sound beam.
6.9
Set the power setting as low as possible but so that the most distal structure in the field can be seen.
 Use the time gain compensation control to obtain an image of uniform brightness.
 8. Do not press the transducer too hard against the patient as this may cause discomfort. Simply use sufficient pressure to maintain good contact between the skin and
the transducer.
 9. Scan slowly and thoroughly to ensure complete examination of each structure, scanning organs in at least two planes to allow a three-dimensional impression to be

Congestive Heart Failure
Left-Sided
Right-Sided
Definition
Heart failure is the failure of the left or right side of the heart to adequately pump blood through the body or through the pulmonary
circulation, respectively. The causes of congestive heart failure may be mechanical failure (valve insufficiency, aortic regurgitation, or
hypertension), myocardial failure (myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, or neoplasia), interference with cardiac filling (severe arrhythmia,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or tamponade), or increased requirement for cardiac output (anemia, overexercise, pregnancy, or
hyperthyroidism).

Table 7.2 / Telephone Assessment and Emergency Transportation Recommendations
When clients call with an emergent situation, they are asked specific questions that will assist in preparing for their arrival and advising the owner on immediate care. The
goal is to minimize stress for both the owner and the patient. Questions may need to be asked multiple times to maintain the attention of the upset and distracted owner.
providing initial treatment, and moving the animal. Before beginning the assessment, determine whether the owner and the animal are in a safe place. In any traumatic
and emergent situation, it is advisable to place a muzzle on the animal if no respiratory distress is noted and mucous membranes are pink. Recommendations listed as 
follows should be altered if the animal becomes aggressive or the procedure produces additional stress. Always ask the owner what is their expected arrival time. This will
allow the staff to make any preparations necessary before their arrival.

CHAPTER 7
Skill Box 7.4 / Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
CPR is the recovery procedure for a patient who is in cardiopulmonary arest (CPA). Animals in this condition are typically of a noncardiac origin and
therefore some of the recommendations differ from those in human medicine. The prevention of CPA is much easier than performing CPR with a
successful outcome. Signs such as brady- or dyspnea, cyanotic or white mucous membranes, weak heart rate or pulses, hypotension, brady- or
 tachycardia should be identified and dealt with immediately. If CPR is determined to be needed, it should begin immediately. If the decision was made
in error, the patient will typically respond to the stimulation provided by the procedure.
Following successful CPR and a return to spontaneous ventilation and cardiac function, the survival rate of discharged patients is only 2-10%. The
care provided following CPR may be the key factor to this low discharge rate. Patients need diligent monitoring of respiratory, cardiovascular, brain,
neurological, renal, and gastrointestinal function. Administering drugs and fluids to support these systems along with intensive patient monitoring will
provide the best outcome.
 The initial ABC assessment (airway, breathing, and circulation] should be performed in 5-10 seconds beginning with circulation followed by airway
and breathing assessments. The signs of cardiac arrest include apnea, agonal breathing, cyanotic or white mucous membranes, no heart rate or pulse, no
bleeding at surgical site, and dilated and fixed pupils.
CPR should ideally be conducted on an adjustable height solid table. Depending on the size of the animal and staff, it may be necessary to provide a
stocl or perform the procedure on the floor. A surgical grated prep table should not be used for CPR as it does not provide the counterpressure needed
for chest and abdominal compressions. The steps below should be assigned to various team members for the smooth facilitation of CPR.
A.Airway
 Alert the emergency team of the upcoming arrival of patient.
Assess the airway:
● Extend the patient's head and neck and pull the tongue forward; remove any debris manually or with suction.
● Establish a patent airway with endotracheal intubation or a slash tracheostomy.
B. Breathing
 Assess breathing:
· Confirm apnea.
· Technique
· Nonintubated patient
● Hold the patient's mouth tightly closed, make a seal with your mouth over patient's nares, and blow into nares.
● Continue at a rate of two quick breaths for every 30 compressions.
(Continued)
436
DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS
Skill Box 7.4 / Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) (Continued)
· Intubated patient
● Place ET while in lateral recumbency to allow simultaneous chest compressions.
· Provide mechanical ventilation via an Ambu bag or anesthetic machine with 100% oxygen at a rate of 150mL/kg/min.
· Initiate with two breaths.
· Reassess for spontaneous breathing.
● If none, continue at 10 breaths/min (1 breath/6s) with a short inspiratory hold of 1 second.
● Each breath should have an expiration slightly longer than inspiration (2: 1) and a manometer pressure reading of
● Canine pressure: <20cm HO
● Feline and small canine (<15kg) pressure: <15 cm HO.
· Acupuncture
· A technique used in conjunction with ventilation techniques used earlier
● Place a 25-gauge needle into the midine just below the nose (philtrum) at a acupuncture point governing vessel (GV) 26. Penetrate the skin and
subcutaneous tissue from 2-4 mm. Rotate the needle up and down at this point to stimulate the site.
C. Circulation
Assess circulatory function:
● Confrm absence of heartbeat and peripheral pulses.
● External cardiac compressions
· Use
· Provides ~30% of normal cardiac output
· Positioning
● Animal weighing < 10kg: lateral recumbency and start compressions with one or two hands over the third to ffth intercostal space
● Animal weighing >10kg: lateral or dorsal recumbency and start compressions with the palm of the hands over the distal one-third of the rib cage
· Barrel-chested dogs: sternal recumbency with two hands directly over the heart
· Deep, keel-chested dogs: lateral recumbency with one to two hands directly over the heart.
·Technique
● With one to two hands, use enough force to displace the thorax 30-50%, (one-third to one-half of the width of the thorax) and then allow full
wall recoil between compressions.
● Compressions are given at a rate of 100-120 compressions/min (1.5-2 compressions/s)
● The compressor should rotate every 2 minutes due to fatigue and subsequent ↓ effciency in technique (e.g., leaning).
· Abdominal compressions can be given between chest compressions or abdominal counterpressure can be applied.
● If no improvement is seen, the compression technique can be changed (e.g, rate, depth, hand position, individual, internal compressions).

· One person or nonintubated patient: 30 compressions, then two quick ventilations
● Two people: uninterrupted compressions, 10 breaths/min (1 breath/6s)
● Three people: uminterrupted compressions, 10 breaths/min (1 breath/6 s) and abdominal compression.
· Inteinal cardiac compressions
· Use
· Provides 60-90% more effective cerebral and coronary perfusion
● Preferred method with rib fractures, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, diaphragmatic hermia, flail chest
· Initiated after 5 minutes if effective tissue perfusion is not seen or initiated after 10 minutes if spontaneous rhythm has not returned.
· Positioning
● Place in left lateral recumbency and a thoracotomy is performed at the ffth to sixth intercostal space.
· Technique
● The palm and fingers are used to pump the heart in a rhythmic fashion.
D. Drugs
· Drugs
●Vasopressors (epinephrine, vasopressin]
●Anticholinergics (atropine)
· Antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, lidocaine]
● Reversal agents (naloxone, flumazenil, atipamezole)
· Technique
● The routes of administration most commonly used are peripheral veins (cephalic, saphenous, sublingual), capillary beds (intratracheal, sublingual,
intralingual, conjunctiva, intrapulmonary], and intraosseus.
 E. Evaluation of the Patient with a Thorough Examination
● Monitoring the patient during CPR will allow adjustments in the treatment plan and also recognition of the return of cardiac and respiratory function
ECG
● Monitoring cardiac activity and rhythm during CPR (e.g., ventricular fbrillation, pulseless idioventricular rhythm, and asystole)
● Artifacts may by seen during chest compressions; brief pauses between 2-minute cycles to review the rhythm are acceptable; however, longer periods
will compromise the procedure.

 heart and resume a normal rhythm.
·Positioning
● The patient is placed in dorsal recumbency for access to both sides of the chest; altermately, the patient is kept in lateral recumbency if a
posterior paddle is available.
· Technique
· Paddles, with gel or paste applied liberally, are placed on either side of the chest at the costochondral junction directly over the heart.
● Starting dose of 4-6 J/kg with a monophasic defibrillator and 2-4 J/kg with a biphasic defibrillator
● Extreme caution should be taken to assure all staff have moved away from the patient.
● Following the first shock, at least one uminterrupted 2-minute cycle of CPR is performed before attempting a second defbrillation with an ↑ dose
of 50%.
● Precordial thump
· Use
● Best used to disrupt supraventricular tachycardia, but may have limited success with ventricular fibrillation
● Only recommended if electrical defbrillation is not available as effcacy is minimal
●Positioning
● Lateral recumbency
· Technique
● A hard blow with the heel of the hand to the area directly over the heart
● Pharmacologic defbrillation
● KCl is administered to induce asystole followed by Cat to reverse the hyperkalemia
● Only recommended if electrical defbrillation is not available as effcacy is minimal
Fluids
● Recommended in cases of hypovclemia and contraindicated in euvclemic and hypervolemic patients

PATIENT CARE
their  medical  conditions but also  tending to their  physical  and  mental
comfort. It is through continuous reassessment that changes and trends are
 seen and the appropriate actions are taken. Patient care is at the heart of our
 our ultimate goal. Patient care encompasses not only monitoring and treating
profession.
 Table 8.1 / Monitoring Levels
Established monitoring levels serve as a guideline for hospitalized patient care. It is the goal that patients will move down to level one with eventual discharge. This
movement can be rapid, over 12 hours with a young healthy dog spay, or may take days to weeks with a critically ill or injured pet. Each monitoring level builds upon the
one before it. For example, the monitoring parameters in level 2 will include all of level 1 along with some additional parameters. The parameters monitored will be
speci fic and individualized for each patient, but these provide general guidelines.
 As shifts and monitoring responsibilities change, it is critical that the LVT become familiar with their particular patients so they are able to predict problems and
recognize changing patterns. This begins with a review of all chart notes and lab work along with discussing the patient with the DVM in charge and the LVT who was
previously providing care. An initial assessment should take place to evaluate all aspects of the patient and their care. The goal is to continually reassess the patient's 
status, response to treatment, and the need for any alterations to the patient's management plan.

mental comfort will positively impact recovery. For example, noticing a patient is sitting or lying uncomfortably may indicate pain that can be remedied with a simple
position change.
Patient comfort begins with understanding their normal routine. Animals are well adjusted to their daily routine at home and change can cause additional stress and
anxiety that affects the recovery process. Providing care that incorporates some of those routines will help patients adjust to a hospital stay. Talking with the owner at
admission and asking routine-directed questions will help with patient care:
+What diet does your pet typically eat and on what schedule?
+Are feeding dishes elevated?
+
Do they avoid certain floor surfaces?
Where do they typically eliminate (e.g., pavement, grass, bark)?
+What is their typical exercise each day?

Table 8.4 / Heat Administration
Heat support is required for all animals unable to regulate their body temperature at the normal level (1 00.5-102.5). Anesthetized, severely ill, and physically
heat support is also important to ensure that they do not become overheated or incidentally burned. Hospitalized or anesthetized patients are often unable to move away
 from an external heat source and have decreased peripheral blood supply leading to sometimes severe thermal burns.
Shivering increases oxygen demand by up to 400%; additional oxygen should be provided if a patient is cold and shivering. Warming devices should be used
immediately; otherwise, cooling will continue. Bair huggers, incubators, IV fluid warmers, and circulating warm air blankets are ideal. Warmed IV fluid bags are not
trends to be assessed and should be measured regularly to ensure a return to normothermia. Esophageal temperature probes are reflective of core body temperature in
anesthetized patients.
Basic heat support that does not require additional equipment includes keeping the patient dry, keeping patients away from air vents and air conditioners, maintaining warm
room temperatures, and providing insulation materials against surgery tables and cages. Along with providing heat support, it is also important to assure heat retention. Many
quick methods have been devised, such as wrapping the patient with bubble wrap, placing the patient on foam padding, and placing baby socks on the paws.

 Procedure
A jugular catheter is placed and advanced to the cranial vena cava. (See Skill Box 8.9, Intravenous Catheter Placement: Peripheral and Jugular,
page 498.) Attach an extension set to the catheter followed by a three-way stopcock. Attach the IV fluids to the open line of the stopcock. Attach
the manometer to the upright opening of the stopcock. Place the patient in sternal recumbency and position the manometer at the level of the
sternum. Turn off the fluids to the patient and fill the manometer with fluids. Open the extension set and allow the fluid level to equalize. The
level at which the fluids stabilizes is the central venous pressure reading. Repeat twice more for accurate results.

 Tip: Jugular catheter placement can be verified by the 2- to S-mm fhuctuations seen on the manometer with each respiration.
Note: Large fluctuations may indicate the catheter tip is placed in the right ventricle; these values are not indicative of CVP. No fluctuations or a dropping meniscus may indicate the catheter

Procedure
The procedure should take place in a calm and quiet environment. All devices that may cause electrical disturbances should be
turned off (e.g., fluorescent bulbs, electrical equipment). Using a nonconductive table (e.g., formica or metal covered with a
blanket or pad), place the patient in right lateral recumbency or, if critically ill, in any position other than sitting that does not 
further increase injury or illness. The limbs should be held parallel to each other and not touching. The forelimbs should be
perpendicular to the long axis of the body If using clips, moisten the areas of attachment with conductive gel, paste, creams, or 
alcohol. Apply the clips and reapply the conductive agent.
● RA/LA: proximal to the olecranon and on the caudal aspect (electrodes may need to be positioned halfway between the
olecranon and carpus if cardiac interference is seen)
+ RL/LL: patellar ligament on the anterior aspect

Small metal plates covered with conductive gel, paste, or creams can be applied to the pads of the feet, or shave the fur and
adhere electrode pads (Holter apparatus) for Tong-term monitoring. To record the activity of the heart, begin by turning on the
machine. Position the stylus in the center of the paper and maintain that position throughout the recording. Turn the sensitivity
switch to 1 to allow 1 mV input to move the stylus 1 cm (two large boxes). (Turn the sensitivity switch to 2 if the tracing is small
and unclear or turn it to /2 if the tracing is large and extending to the top and bottom of the paper.) Turn the record switch to a
paper speed of 50mm/s and push the standardization button to record the reference size of 1mV. Record the desired leads:
●Turn the lead selector to 1 and record two sets (30 large boxes).
●Without turming off the machine or changing any other parameters, turn the lead selector to 2 and continue through to aVF

Venipuncture
Venipuncture is the technique of puncturing a vein with a needle. This pro-
 cedure is done to collect a blood sample from the venous circulation, to give
an intravenous injection, or to place an intravenous catheter. Proficiency of
these skills is a requirement of all technicians.

Preparation
 4. Drug Preparation
1. Prepare in a type 2B biological safety cabinet or a well-ventilated area.
 2. Use a closed system transfer device (CsTD) (e.g., Phaseal", Equashield) following manufacturer guidelines to add diluent
or to draw up the drug. If a CSTD is not available, the following steps should be followed with the knowledge that risk of
exposure to personnel and patient is high:
a.
 Remove plastic cover of vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab
C.
 Attach the syringe to the filter while holding the vial upright.
d. If adding a diluent, add slowly and then mix the contents of the vial completely with the Luer-Lok syringe left in place.
e.
 Turn vial upside down and aspirate the drug into the syringe slowly to avoid excess air bubbles.
Push any excess air back into the syringe before separating from the vial
g.
Wrap gauze around the connection between the syringe and the vial and gently pull apart.
h. Place a covered needle onto the syringe.
+ Do not inject air into the vial; maintaining a negative pressure within the vial reduces the risk of aerosolization.
When not using a hydrophobic filter, all the above steps are accomplished with a needle attached to the end of a
Luer-Lok syringe.
+[
 Do not fill a syringe more than two-thirds full to prevent the plunger from detaching from the end of the syringe.
●If an agent is to be administered via a fluid bag, fill the administration set with plain diluent before adding the
chemotherapy agent to reduce the risk of contamination when attaching the line to the patient.
●If prepared drugs need to be moved throughout the hospital, they should be transported in a sealed plastic bag or container.

Preparation
6.DrugAdministration
1. With an alcohol-soaked gauze around the end of the catheter, insert the needle into the catheter and administer the drug
at the correct rate but at an even pace to avoid leakage around venipuncture site.
2. Flush the catheter with 3-5mL nonheparinized 0.9% sodium chloride after administration to avoid irritation to the vein.
 3. Monitor for allergic reactions for up to 1 hour after administration of certain drugs (e.g., L-asparginase).
4. Apply a pressure wrap after removing the catheter and maintain pressure for several minutes.
● Place an alcohol-soaked gauze sponge over the injection site whenever inserting or removing the needle or catheter to
avoid aerosolization of the drug.
+[
 Do not aspirate the drug back into the catheter after administration to avoid dilution and residual drug in the catheter
injection port.
7. Disposal
1. Place all items in a ziplock bag to prevent aerosolization.
2. Dispose of the waste into an appropriate chemotherapy container.
 3. Clean the preparation and administration surfaces thoroughly with bleach or soap and water and disposable towels.
● Before removing gloves, place capped syringes and any other used products that may aerosolize into your hands, pull
 gloves off over the materials, and then dispose of them in a chemotherapy approved container.
+ A surface wipe test can be done for drug detection and removal (e.g., Chemoglo").
8.Postpatient Care
1. Wear a double layer of gloves when handling waste from the patient for the first 72 hours.
 2. Wipe down cages; avoid the use of a hose or spray to ↓ aerosolization of excreted drugs.
3. Closely monitor response to the drug (e.g., atitude, appetite, eliminations, and general behavior).
 Note: Chemotherapy administration should take place in a well-ventilated, low-traffic area of the hospital.

area and possible loss of the limb. The cause can be an improperly placed IV catheter, patient movement, or fragile veins. Due to this high risk, only a
catheter with perfect placement on the first attempt should be used for chemotherapy administration. Once a vein has been unsuccessfully punctured, a
new vein should be used. If this is not possible, proper clotting should occur before a proximal site is used. Peripheral veins should be saved for 
chemotherapy treatment with the jugular veins used for blood collection. The vein used should be recorded at each treatment and rotated.
The patient should be continuously monitored during chemotherapy administration for adverse clinical signs. Signs of extravasation injury are pain,
redness, swelling, or resistance to infusion of medication.

Table 8.14 / Chemotherapy Toxicity
 Chemotherapy is the process of administering drugs to attack actively growing and dividing tumor cells. Unfortunately, these agents are not selective for tumor cells and
will attack other cells (e.g., bone marrow cells, gastrointestinal cells). With the administration of any chemotherapy agents the patient must be monitored for adverse
reactions and toxicities. Toxicities may not appear for several days following administration or until an accumulation of toxic levels have been obtained within the body.
Most protocols are generally designed to result in <5% hospitalization rate (e.g., sepsis) for chemotherapy toxicity and <1% direct mortality rate from any particular 
toxicity.

Skill Box 8.17 / Client Education: Monitoring for Hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia is an abnormally low blood glucose level. This is often seen when there is an excess of insulin circulating in the bloodstream. This can be
caused by overdoes of insulin, missing or delaying a meal, eating less than normal, vomiting, strenuous exercise, stress, and certain medications. With a
blood glucose level <60mg/dL, most animals will show signs stumbling or staggering, and the administration of a carbohydrate source will result in a
quick recovery. Animals with a blood glucose level <20mg/dL often lose consciousness and seizures may occur; the administration of a carbohydrate
source (e.g., Karo syrup] should be immediately instituted followed by immediate medical attention.

FLUID THERAPY
 Fluid administration is necessary during times of dehydration, shock, exces-
 sive blood loss, surgery, or a disease resulting in depletion of the patient's
normal fluid, electrolyte or acid-base balances. Fluid replacement is based
on an animal's hydration status, reason for fluid loss, and its physical condi-
tion. Performing the following assessments will help determine dehydration
versus perfusion status and assist the veterinarian in the calculation of fluid
requirements for the animal.

Table 8.17 / Commonly Used Fluids
Selecting the type of fluid to administer can be as important as the selected route and rate. In selecting a fluid, it is important to know the electrolyte status of the patient
and the underlying disease. Fluids are then chosen based on what best fits the patient's condition and need.
Crystalloids are the most commonly used extracellular replacement fluid as they rapidly correct volume deficits. They contain electrolyte and nonelectrolyte solutes and

administration.
Colloids are most commonly used in shock, severe hypoalbuminemia, sepsis, SRS, and hypotension to replace intravascular fluids.Due to thelarge molecular weight,
colloids remain in the plasma compartment to expand volume. Synthetic colloids are chosen when the albumin is >2 g/dL and natural colloids (e.g., plasma, pRBCs) are

+Multiply the total time (h) by 6Omin/h = total minutes.
 Determine the amount of fluids needed per minute:
1200mL ÷ 300 minutes = 4mL/min
●Divide the total fluid amount (mL) by the time (min) = mL/min.
Calculate the rate (drops/min) based on the administration set:
4mL/min × 15 drops/mL = 60 drops/min
+Multiply the mL/min by the drops/mL.

Table 8.22 / Blood Transfusion Reactions
Despite careful attention to detail, transfusion reactions may still occur. Reactions are seen both acutely (within minutes to hours) or delayed (days to years) and are
divided into immunologic or nonimmunologic causes. Immunologic reactions are caused by an antigen-antibody response between the recipient and the donor blood
product. Nonimmunologic reactions are caused by problems with blood samples or administration techniques. Treatment for transfusion reactions are directed toward
alleviating clinical signs and basic supportive care (e.g., fluid support, oxygen support, diuretics, antipyretics, steroids, antihistamines).

Table 9.2 / Pain Scales
Pain scales formulated through research and anecdotal hospital situations provide another means of evaluating patients. Each scale has its advantages and disadvantages.
The system chosen should prove to be reliable (providing consistent results), valid (efectively measuring the degree of pain), and sensitive (able to detect small changes).
Observer training and experience is the key to using these systems appropriately and consistently.

Table 9.3 / Behaviors Suggesting Pain and Anxiety
Each behavior that an animal portrays may have a variety of meanings. Often a behavior may indicate both pain and normal behavior. When evaluating whether a patient
is in pain, look for multiple behaviors to assure a correct assesment.Research has shown that animals routinely hide their pain when in the presence of observers,
experiencing some level of pain after a surgical procedure, or during an illness or injury.
pain. Although the owner is often a better judge to the patient's pain level, it may take the asking about specific behaviors for recognition of the subtle changes. See Skill
Box 9.1, Chronic Pain Evaluation, page 538.
The behaviors listed as follows are marked based on their possible cause. Pain can be the cause of any behavior, but it may not be the only cause or the cause in a
particular patient. Evaluating a large number of behaviors will help to create a better picture of a patient's level of pain.

Skill Box 9.3 / Constant Rate Infusion Calculations
Setting up CRIs is a valuable skill and one that only requires basic drug calculations. However, due to the number of steps required and the differences
in units, the process can be tricky. Following a systematic process can help to alleviate potential errors. There are many CRI calculators available, but
understanding the logic is important for those situations when calculators do not work. Drug doses are often given in either microgram per kilogram per
minute or microgram per kilogram per hour, and depending on how the CRI is to be set up, one or more conversions may need to be performed. Be
sure to always check and recheck any calculations and units.

WOUND TREATMENT AND BANDAGING
Inevitably, pets end up with wounds, either self-inflicted or caused by another
source. These wounds may be intentional, such as a surgical incision, or an
accident. A technician plays a valuable role in the setup, preparation, clean-
ing, and the actual bandaging of these wounds. An umderstanding of the
wound healing process, supplies to use, and the expected final outcome is
necessary for proper treatment and care. These items are included in this
chapter to facilitate excellent nursing care by the technician.
Table 10.1 / Wound Healing Process
The wound healing process is not a stationary process; several phases occur simultaneously with subtle transitions. The rate and quality of the healing is dependent on
many factors, such as nutritional status, current medications (e.g., steroids, cytotoxic drugs), infection, and additional treatments (e.g., radiation).

PATIENT CARE SKILLS
 Table 10.3 / Factors Affecting the Healing Process
Factor
Effect on Healing
Age of Patient
+ An older patient requires more nursing care and good nutrition for healing to occur.
Blood Supply
● Blood supply is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and metabolic substrates that promote wound healing
●Dehydration, trauma to the area, tight bandages, or location of the wound may have an effect on this factor.
● Certain stages (e.g., epithelilization) of wound healing are oxygen dependent and require optimal blood supply.
Dead Space
● Fluid accumulation mechanically inhibits adhesion (e.g., flaps and grafts) to the granulation bed.
●Sutures and drains reduce the dead space.
Diseased or Debilitated Patients
+ Diseased, debilitated, or stressed organs hinder the healing process.
●Delayed wound healing with diabetes, hepatic disease, hyperadrenocorticism, neoplasia, and uremia.
+ Geriatrics often heal slower, potentially due to concurrent disease or debilitation.
+ Uremia/azotemia: increases the time formation of granulation tissue occurs.
 Foreign Material
Hemostasis
●If bleeding is not stabilized effectively, a seroma or hematoma may form.
● Extra fluid in a wound slows down the healing process as the body must reabsorb and break down old blood and fluid during
the inflammatory phase.
● Can predispose to sepsis of wound
Incision
● Electroscalpel or electrocoagulation can cause more necrosis.
Infection
● Overgrowth of bacteria prolongs the inflammatory phase and may lead to a systemic infection (sepsis).
 Medications
● Medications may inhibit connective tissue building and epithelial cell turmover rate.
+ Corticosteroids delay the entire wound healing process and ↑ the risk of infection.
+ Aspirin may affect blood cloting during the early phase of wound healing.
+Anti-inflammatory drugs affect inflammation.
● Chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation can drastically inhibit wound healing (e.g., postoperative interval 10-14 days desirable
between surgery and adjunct antineoplastic treatment)
Moisture
+A moist environment allows for optimal healing.

 Necrotic Tissue
+ Dead tissue prolongs the inflammatory phase and predisposes the animal to sepsis.
Nutrition
● Malnutrition and serum albumin <1.5-2.0g/dL delay wound healing and diminish wound strength.
● Vitamin supplementation (e.g., vitamins A and E) and aloe vera can ↑ wound healing.

 prevent further hemorrhage or contamination. Ideally, wounds should be treated within the first 6-8 hours before bacterial contamination has multiplied
and the wound becomes infected. Infected wounds, rather than contaminated wounds, are often covered with a thick, viscous exudate and visually
appear dirty. Before any procedure involving wound care, gloves should be worn by those in contact with the wound because bacteria may be
translocated to the wounds.
 Setup
+ Chlorhexidine solution
●Wound cleaning fluids
●Suture material
+ Surgical instruments (e.g., hemostats, needle holder, scissors, thumb forceps)
●Clippers
●Gloves
+Sterile water-soluble lubricant
Tip: Scissors dipped in mineral oil can be used so that the hair will stick to the scissors and stay out of the wound.
Step I: Wound Preparation
1. Clean out any large, obvious debris.
 2. Protect the wound from further contamination (e.g., water-soluble lubricant (K-Y Jelly"), saline-soaked gauze, or temporarily close with sutures, clamps, or staples).
 3. Remove the hair from around the wound with scissors or clippers.
 4. Prepare the clipped skin as a surgical prep; avoid using alcohol.
 5. Remove the wound protectant (e.g., water-soluble lubricant IK-Y Jelly], saline-soaked gauze, or temporarily close with sutures, clamps, or staples).
Step II: Wound Cleaning
+ Lavage the wound to reduce the bacterial count and remove additional contaminants and necrotic debris (7-8 psi of pressure with saline or LRS)
Lavage Sofutions

Step Ill: Wound Debridement
Debridement is the removal of necrotic tissue and debris that has adhered to the wound surface impeding wound healing.
Debridement Method
●Autolytic: maintaining a moist environment with hydrophilic, occlusive, or semiocclusive bandaging.
● Bandage: wet-to-dry and dry-to-dry bandages allowed to adhere to the wound surface, not highly recommended due to unselective debridement and damage during the
proliferative stage of wound healing.
+ Surgical: excision of devitalized tissue (e.g., skin, muscle, contaminated fat) and bone sequestra.

Step IV: Wound Closure
The type of closure is dependent on time lapse, degree of contamination, tissue damage, thoroughness of debridement, blood supply, animal's health, closure without skin
tension or dead space, and location of wound.
Primary Wound Closure
+ First intention wound healing; wound is sutured closed
● Used when wounds are 6-8 hours old, with minimal tissue damage and minimal contamination or cleaned wounds
Contraction and Epithelialization
● Second intention wound healing; wound is left to heal open with epitheliali zation and skin defect contraction over time (days to week)
● Used when wounds are >5 days old, have significant tissue damage and loss, or are excessively contaminated
+ Allows gradual debridement and drainage; new skin may not contain hair follicles
DelayedPrimary Closure
+ Third intention wound healing; wound is sutured closed after the granulation tissue has formed
+ Used when wounds are 3-5 days old and are heavily contaminated or infected
●Allows controlled debridement and optimal drainage
Drain Placement
Used to eliminate dead space and to provide drainage of potentially harmful fluids (e.g., blood, pus, serum).
Passive drains (e.g., Penrose drains) allow drainage by gravity and are most commonly used for subcutaneous spaces.
Active drains allow drainage with an intermittent or continuous negative pressure that is either open or closed to the environment and are most commonly used for deep
wounds and after grafting of skin.
 Ascending infection is the most common complication of drains (especially Penrose drains) and should therefore be covered with a sterile dressing; change as needed.
Step V: Postoperative Care and Assessment
Monitoring
+ Visual inspection for fluid accumulation, tension, infection, dehiscence, and necrosis
● Ultrasound evaluation for fluid accumulation, scar formation, granulation tissue, blood clots, edematous regions, and epidermis
Drain Care
● Monitor for drainage as tissue fragments, viscous exudates, or fibrin may occlude the tube

Table 10.5 / Topical Wound Medications
The use of topical medications allows direct contact of the medication with the wound bed. While each topical medication has its benefits, they can cause deleterious
effects (e.g., cytotoxicity, delaying epithelialization), and care should be taken when choosing the medication. Topical medications used on wounds heavily contaminated
will not be able to penetrate the deeper tissues; therefore, the wound should be debrided and cleaned prior to the use of the medication.

Table 10.7 / Wound Bandaging
Wound healing is a process involving many different stages, each requiring a specific environment for optimal results. Bandaging most often can provide the changing
environment needed for each stage. Bandaging provides cleanliness, immobility, control of wound environment, elimination of dead space, hemostasis, decreased edema
and pain, moisture, and warmth. Bandaging can also increase the acidity of the wound environment, resulting in an increase in oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin,
thereby increasing oxygen to the wound, which promotes healing.
The patient should be more comfortable after bandage placement. A patient that is very upset with a bandage should be evaluated for incorrect bandage placement, skin
irritation, or worsening of the wound. Some keys to successful bandaging are the following:
●Pressure should be applied over and distal to the wound as proximal pressure will impede blood and lymphatic returm with subsequent swelling and ederma.
+
Avoid wrinkles in the bandaging material as these may become areas of discomfort.
+
+ Almost all bandages and splints should be applied with the limb at a normal functional angle, seen when the animal is at rest in lateral recumbency. Wounds over
joints may need to be bandaged in extension to avoid contracture deformity and subsequent limited joint use.

1. Place multiple, loose, simple interrupted sutures (≥5) in the healthy
skin, 3-4 mm from the wound edges.
Tip: Use a large monoflament suture material with strong knot security (eg., O or 2-0).
Tip: Suture loops should be large enough to easily pass the umbilical tape (l/4in.) through
but small enough to allow enough tension when tying.
2. Apply the primary dressing [e.g., adherent or nonadherent) to fill the
open wound followed by a protective outer layer (e.g., laporotomy pad).
3. Secure the outer bandage layer by lacing umbilical tape through the
 preplaced suture loops and tying it to itself.
4. Adhesive tape or other tertiary bandage material may be placed over
the top for additional stability.
5. Subsequent bandage changes only require the removal of the umbilical

Skill Box 11.8 / Respiratory Procedures: Nebulization, Coupage, and Metered-Dose Inhalers
Nebulization is an aerosol therapy providing a fine mist of liquid droplets in a carrier gas. Nebulization is indicated to moisten respiratory tissue, loosen
secretions, and stimulate coughing. Ideally, the patient uses slow, deep breaths to allow the peripheral airways to be reached; otherwise, treatment will
be concentrated in the upper airways. Improvement with subsequent treatments willallow better treatment of the lower respiratory system. Treatments
are often followed by coupage as a way of breaking up and eliminating respiratory debris through coughing. Metered-dose inhalers are able to deliver
high drug concentrations to the lungs while avoiding or minimizing systemic side effects.

Tip: To help locate the bladder, pour alcohol onto the abdomen of an animal in dorsal recumbency and it will pool in the location of the bladder or mentally draw an X crossing over the
abdomen between the last two sets of marmmary glands. These techniques are then confirmed by palpation.
Tip: Always save ≥l mL of sterile urine for an unexpected culture.

 ANESTHESIA AND ANESTHETIC PROCEDURES
PREANESTHESIA
Table 12.1 /  Preanesthetic Evaluation
A complete review of this list should be conducted on each patient prior to the administration of any drugs. These initial assessments will prove valuable in choosing the
correct drug protocol and in monitoring the patient during and following the anesthetic procedure. Potential complications and plans to correct them are projected during
this step. Patients with known health concerns or those revealing abnormalities with the tests that follow should have a specific anesthesia plan put in place. Guidelines
for specific health conditions can be found in Table 12.15, Case-Based Anesthesia, page 661.

Parameters to Evaluate
Signalment
The species, breed, age, and temperament of the patient can have direct implications on the type of drugs used during the
anesthetic procedure along with the type of monitoring used.
History
Both recent and past history of anesthetic episodes, medications, meals, and ongoing diseases will affect the anesthetic protocol.

ASA Physical Statusa
The American Society of Anesthesiologist's classification system adapts to small animal medicine with ease. It allows a system to
evaluate the patient based on the presence and severity of systemic disease present.
I Excellent anesthetic risk; patients with no underlying disease, undergoing elective surgeries
Il Cood anesthetic risk, mild disease changes
I Fair anesthetic risk, severe disease changes
IV Poor anesthetic risk, severe disease changes that are a constant threat to life
V Critical anesthetic risk; moribund, not expected to survive without surgery

Ventilation
Table 12.4 / Ventilation
One of the key elements to successful anesthesia is providing adequate ventilation of the patient. Improper maintenance of ventilation may lead to hypoxia, brain
damage, or even death. Even though respiration can be seen by the rising and falling of the chest, this does not always ensure adequate movement of air. Assisted
performed an equipment and pressure check. Patients should also have arterial blood gas analysis or capnograph monitoring to adequately monitor the levels of CO2.
Hypocapnia (hyperventilating) can lead to respiratory alkalosis and hypercapnia (hypoventilating) to respiratory acidosis.
Determining the need for ventilation in a nonanesthetized patient is critical. Patient criteria that affect this decision are the patient's inability to oxygenate even with
supplementation, ↑ PCO2, and patient fatigue, all leading to the final outcome of respiratory failure.

this poses an additional risk to the patient:
· Release the bag and open the pop-off valve.
Note: Due to the risk of barotrauma and possibly death from failure to open the pop-off valve and release pressure in the system, it is recommended that all anesthetic machines have a pop-off
occlusion valve in place. These valves allow closing of the pop-off valve with the use of a button that, once released, immediately releases pressure and eliminates the risk of patient injury.
ANESTHETIC ADMINISTRATION
Table 12.5 / General Anesthesia Induction
The administration of anesthesia allows necessary veterinary procedures to commence without difficulty by immobilizing the patient and eliminating pain. The proper
administration of anesthesia ensures the comfort of the patient during administration, the procedure, and following the procedure. Prior to the induction of any anesthetic,
an intravenous catheter should be placed. This allows for titration of the induction agent, emergency intravenous access, intravenous fluid administration, and to avoid the
risk of a perivascular injection.

Table 12.8 / Local Anesthetic Uses
In general, local anesthetics can be used as part of a multimodal anesthetic plan to provide total analgesia to an affected area. Local anesthetics are typically injected near
a nerve bundle as they can cause nerve damage and be painful if injected within the nerve or nervous tissue. For infiltration procedures, the drug can be diluted with
sterile saline to increase the volume and decrease the concentration. This is important when larger lesions need to be blocked. The syringe should be aspirated before

Table 12.10 / Stages of Anesthesia
Anesthesia is divided into four stages depending on the physical response of the patient. Understanding these different levels and when patients should be entering or
leaving each one is an important aspect of induction and recovery. Stage I is characterized by excitement and struggling accompanied by epinephrine release with
associated increased heart and respiratory rate. Stage Il is the beginning of unconsciousness and involuntary movement. Vomiting may happen in this stage along with
breath holding and self-injury. Stage Ill consists of four diferent planes of anesthesia with plane 1 as light anesthesia to plane 4 as deep anesthesia (early overdose). Stage
IV is irreversible anesthesia often leading to death within 1-5 minutes.

Table 12.11 / Anesthesia Monitoring
There are many parameters to monitor with the anesthetized patient. They are broken up into four categories with cardiovascular and respiratory providing the most
information about how the patient is handling the anesthetic procedure. Reflexes are an excellent determinate for anesthetic depth and thermoregulation plays an overal
role in the patient's ability to handle the procedure.

In the fnal stages of PD, the tooth becomes loose due to destruction of the
soft tissues surrounding the tooth and erosion of the bony socket. This
process not only affects the tooth itself, but plays a large role in overall animal
health by allowing the accumulated bacteria to enter the bloodstream affect-
ing all other body systems (e.g., heart, lung, kidney).
Client education is the key to gaining acceptance to veterinary dentistry.
 The combination of preventative and therapeutic dental care will positively
impact the quantity and quality of life of our veterinary patients.

Skill Box 13.3 / Local Dental Nerve Blocks
Utilization of local dental nerve blocks prior to extractions has been found to decrease the amount and depth of general anesthetic used during the
 procedure, to create a smoother recovery, and to decrease the need for immediate postoperative narcotics for pain management. Dental nerve blocks
interrupt the nerve conduction to a specifc part of the body. Training on proper placement of these blocks is essential, as well as verifying that licensed
veterinary technicians are allowed to perform this procedure within the state of residence.
 It is critical to aspirate prior to injection of the anesthesia to avoid improper injection into the bloodstream. IV injection of the local anesthetic may
cause cardiac and/or nervous system toxicosis (total dose should not exceed 2mg/kg]. Neurological complications of nerve blocks are transient loss of
vision, Horner's syndrome, facial nerve palsey, unilateral deafness, and transient nerve paralysis.
 Epinephrine may be added for its vasoconstrictive effects. Local anesthetics cause a vasodilation effect, which removes the drug from the intended
area quicker. With the addition of epinephrine and its vasoconstrictive effects, the duration of the local anesthetic effect is extended. Its use is
contraindicated in patients with cardiac arrhythmias, umcontrolled hyperthyroidism, asthma or if using halothane anesthesia.
Bupivacaine has a lag time of 6-12 minutes postinjection, but provides 4-6 hours of analgesia.

Specialized Surgical Packs
 Many instruments may be used only on occasion and should be set aside in separate packs. Instruments weaken with constant scrubbing and autoclaving,
 and should therefore not be subjected to umnecessary sterilization. The instrument type and number included in each of these packs will depend on surgeon
 preference.

Endoscopy has quickly become a popular technique for minimally invasive procedures. Its primary indications are vast, and include visualization of the GIT, respiratory
diagnosis (e.g., biopsies, brushings, washes), along with performing often curative procedures (e.g., foreign body retrieval, polyp or tumor removal, dilation of strictures,

 extreme importance. Many additional steps must be taken before laser equipment is used in the operating room to assure safety of the patient, surgeon, and support staff.
Procedure
Laser Surgery (Light Amplification by the Stimulation Emission of Radiation)
Definition
Laser surgery consists of light interaction (reflected, absorbed, scattered, transmited) with tissue, causing certain effects
Indications
+Lithotripsy and angioplasty
+ Soft tissue dental procedures
+Dermatology surgery (e.g., acral lick granuloma)
+ Ophthalmic surgery (e.g, glaucoma, tumors, retinal detachment)
Equipment
+ Several different lasers (e.g., COz laser, Nd :YAG lasers, diode lasers) exist with varying wavelengths, delivery, and application techniques
● Endotracheal tubes approved for laser surgery, or less desirably, a red rubber endotracheal tube wrapped in metal tape
Technique
+ The laser tip is focused toward the tissue to be incised and discharged
● Technique is variable depending on desired outcome (e.g., focused laser location for drilling a hole)
Precautions
Exposure risk: ocular damage, burns, inhalation of viable tumor cells
+ Protective eyewear should always be worn and the patient's eyes should be shielded.
+
 Proper evacuation of noxious smoke
+ Use blackened or pitted instruments to absorb stray or reflected light.
Combustion/Fire
● Approved endotracheal tubes to avoid explosion of flowing oxygen
● A bucket of water and a CO, fire extinguisher should be within reach.
+ Use moistened gauze sponges or drapes around the surgical area.
+ Evacuate or pack the rectum to control methane gas release.
●Avoid use of excess iodine or alcohol during skin preparation.
+Appropriate warning signs and window barriers should be available.
Side Effects

Table 15.7 / Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
TCM is used as a complement to Westen medicine and as an altermative treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses four aspects: acupuncture, herbal
medicine, therapeutic massage, and nutrition. Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine are the most cormmonly used portions of this medical system. Acupuncture itself
themselves also may be stimulated in different ways (e.g., electroacupuncture, moxibustion, and manually) to assist treatment.
The goal is not always to heal the patient; it can also be used to allow the body to be better able to deal with disease conditions. Animals treated with acupuncture
may reach death more peacefully and with less suffering.
