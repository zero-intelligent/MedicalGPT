tal x-ray unit should be provided.
Dental procedures require instruments and materials.
 If the veterinarian works alone, much time is spent
 acquiring these essentials. Four-handed dentistry, prac-
ticed commonly in human dentistry, employs a dental
assistant who envisages what the dentist needs, then
hands over the instruments and materials. In veterinary
dental practice, four-handed dentistry increases the effi-
ciency of dental procedures performed and decreases
the time of anesthesia. To permit four-handed dentistry,
sufficient space must be provided for one or two veteri-
nary dental technicians to work on both sides of the ani-
mal with uninterrupted access to the head.
The dental operatory should not be located in the
same room as general surgery. Bacteria-laden aerosols
released during ultrasonic scaling will contaminate the
room and patients. Most practices perform dental pro-
cedures in the treatment area (Figures 1.3, 1.4)

prevent heat damage to surrounding tissue generated by
drilling and to remove debris. If local water contains an
abundance of minerals, a filter is recommended to
 decrease sediment collected, thereby increasing the effi-
ciency and the life of dental handpieces. Distilled water
can be used in stand-alone units where water is poured
into a holding tank. Distilled water from a distiller can also
be plumbed directly into the delivery system (Figure 1.6).
In time, a bacterial biofilm forms along the internal
surfaces of the water lines. In human dentistry, this
biofilm has been blamed for introducing pathogenic
bacteria into the oral cavity. A bacterial microfilter and
a chlorhexidine flushing system can be installed to
decrease the biofilm (Figure 1.7).

LIGHTING
 Proper lighting and magnification are fundamental to
the efficient delivery of small animal dentistry.

optimal illumination and magnification:
· When possible, the operatory should be designed
with windows to allow outside lighting.
 An overhead color-balanced dental lamp helps illu-
 minate the oral cavity. The light should be positioned
25-30 inches (approximately an arm's length) from
the oral cavity. When properly placed, the light illu-
minates the area to be treated without projecting
shadows of the operator's hands on the oral cavity
(Figure 1.15).

of dental lesions. Radiography is the most useful diag-
 nostic aid available to the veterinarian practicing den-
tistry.
 Dental radiographs may be exposed with the stan-
dard radiography unit. The location and fixed nature of
these units requires animal patients to be moved from
the dental table to the radiograph area. With endodon-
tic and some oral surgical procedures, patient relocation 
would have to be performed multiple times, which adds
time and inconvenience. A dedicated dental radiograph
unit is an indispensable piece of equipment in the den-
tal operatory (Figure 1.27).
 The dental radiography unit can be purchased with a
retractable arm extending up to 6 feet. The unit can be 
positioned to reach multiple treatment tables. Floor-

CHAPTER 1
ANESTHESIA
 By necessity, dentistry is performed while the animal is
 anesthetized. Anesthesia allows the practitioner and
technician to carry out procedures on immobilized
 patients without pain. A properly fitted cuffed endo-
tracheal tube must be used for patient safety. The cuff:
· Prevents the contaminated oral environment and
water from entering the respiratory system.
 Aids in patient oxygenation and anesthetic delivery.
● Decreases operator-inhaled anesthetic gases.
Incorporating the anesthetic delivery system in the
operatory console or mounted on the wall increases effi-
ciency and decreases floor clutter. Canister or active suc-
tion anesthetic scavenger systems are required (see
Figure 1.26).
Patient Monitoring Devices
Patient monitoring devices are essential for the mainte-
nance of anesthesia. Some dental procedures require
hours of anesthesia. Electrocardiograph monitoring,

Coronal to the CEJ in cases of gingival hyperplasia.
 In cases of gingival hyperplasia the base remains the
same, but an apparent pseudopocket forms due to
excessive gingiva.
· Apical to the CEJ in cases of gingival recession. The
clinical attachment level measurement is determined
by adding the probing depth to the gingival recession
measurement (distance between the cementoenamel
junction to the gingival margin). When the gingival
margin is located apical to the cementoenamel junc-
tion, the loss of attachment will be greater than the
pocket depth.
Following are some examples of the clinical signifi-
cance of probing depth and attachment loss:
·A Labrador retriever whose maxillary canine has a 9
mm pocket depth and an 8 mm attachment loss from
Stage 4 periodontal disease may require an apical
reposition flap to decrease the pocket depth and save
the tooth (number 1 in (Figure 2.76).
· A boxer with a 7 mm pocket depth and a 5 mm
hyperplastic gingiva (distance from the CEJ to the
gingival margin) secondary to gingival hyperplasia
should undergo a gingivectomy to eliminate the
pseudopocket (number 2 in Figure 2.76).
· A poodle with a 2 mm pocket depth and an 8 mm
attachment loss around the maxillary canine from
 gingival recession has a normal probing depth but
significant attachment loss. Extraction may be the
treatment of choice (number 3 in Figure 2.76).

tooth's support. Loose, free flowing plaque in the peri-
odontal pocket causes more disease than adherent
plaque. At one time it was thought that the goal of sub-
gingival care was to create a smooth surfaced root by
removing plaque and calculus-laden cementum. Every
professional hygiene/teeth-cleaning visit used to be com-
pleted by hand scaling the accessible root surface
smooth.
Currently, cementum removal as part of the oral
 hygiene visit is discouraged. Cementum contains cell-
activating proteins that encourage reattachment. Dentin
does not contain these proteins. The design and safety

MATERIALS FOR SHARPENING INSTRUMENTS
A variety of materials are available for proper instru-
ment sharpening. These include sharpening stones,
lubricant, gloves, alcohol soaked gauze, plastic test
stick, and a magnifying glass. Mechanical sharpeners
are also available (Figures 2.84, 2.85).
Types of sharpening stones include the following:

face.
 Methods used to determine whether an instrument
requires sharpening or recontouring (reshaping) include
visual inspection, comparison, and use of test sticks.
Close visual examination of an instrument can help
determine the need for sharpening. The instrument is
held under a bright light and examined with a magnify-
ing glass. Dull cutting edges reflect light; sharp edges do
 not reflect light.
A master set of unused instruments should be avail-
able for inspection. Visual comparison of a used instru-
ment with a new one can be used to determine sharp-
ness and retention of the original contour.
Hard plastic test sticks can be used to determine
whether an instrument requires sharpening. The instru-
ment blade is drawn across the test stick. The sharp

Regardless of the method used, care must be taken to
avoid removing too much metal, which can damage the

1. Place a drop of oil on the flat stone and distribute

 3. To determine the correct edge (lower) to sharpen in
 an area-specific curette, hold the curette with the
 toe pointed toward yourself and the terminal shank
 perpendicular to the floor.

● Sonic scaler tips vibrate at low frequencies ranging
between 3000-9000 CPS (cycles per second) and are
best used to remove plaque and fresh calculus. Most
veterinary patients are presented with chronic calcu-
lus accumulation.
● Sonic scalers have a wide amplitude (0.5 mm) com-
pared to ultrasonic (0.01-0.05 mm). This wider
amplitude may result in greater cementum removal
when the scaler is used subgingivally compared to
the ultrasonic scaler equipped with a periodontal tip
for subgingival use.

Unfortunately, electrically driven delivery units have
several drawbacks. The micromotor powered dental
unit is limited in what it can do because there is no
water for cooling. If used, an assistant must spray water
on the field to cool the bur to prevent iatrogenic ther-
mal damage. Additionally, micromotors operate below
30,000 RPM with high torque, causing excessive vibra-
tions that make accurate work difficult (Figure 2.113).

 The foot pedal starts and stops the system, and—in
some units-—controls handpiece speed.
Nitrogen-Powered
Some delivery systems use nitrogen to power hand-
pieces. Nitrogen gas can provide clean oil-free power,
which may extend the handpiece life. Because power is
directly delivered from gas cylinders, compressors and
air storage tanks are not necessary. There is no electri-
cal requirement and no compressor noise. Additionally,
nitrogen-driven delivery systems require less mainte-
nance than air-driven units. The typical cost of nitrogen
is less than $.50 U.S. per procedure. Nitrogen is not rec-
 ommended to power air-driven sonic scalers because of
the large volume of gas needed (Figure 2.119).

used for polishing teeth:
-The metallic prophy angle, which rotates 360°,
 might catch and/or pull hair around the animal's
lip. Unfortunately, metallic prophy angles are
rarely sterilized, predisposing the spread of viral
and bacterial infections between patients (951-
4635 Burns, iM3 Inc. L6700, Schein 100-7458)
(Figure 2.126).
The metallic prophy angle, which oscillates 90°
and reverses, will usually engage less lip hair
(Burns 699-3990, iM3 L6970, Schein 928- 2280).
The disposable plastic single-use prophy angle is
preferred by the author because of reduced cross-
contamination, lack of maintenance, ease of oper-
ation, and low expense (Burns 953-2598, Schein
136-2503) (Figure 2.127).
The oscillating disposable prophy angle rotates
90° and reverses. Advantages of the oscillating
disposable prophy angle include decreased heat
generated on the tooth surface and less lip hair
caught in the polishing cup (Burns 941-2205, iM3

2.130,2.131). Attaching a bur to the high-speed hand-
piece is an easy procedure. The chuck is tightened by
thumb control, built-in lever, or by using a bur insert-
 ing/removal tool (Figures 2.132-2.134).

ROTARY CUTTING
INSTRUMENTS
Rotary cutting dental instruments are used to:
· Section multirooted teeth and/or remove part of the
buccal alveolus to facilitate extraction.
 Perform alveoloplasty to smooth out sharp projections.
?
?
 Provide access points for root canal therapy.
· Provide mechanical retention of restorative material.
?
 Reduce and reshape teeth for crown preparation.
· Reduce crown height in crown reduction procedures.
· Remove part of the maxilla or mandible.
Burs are instruments placed into the dental hand-
 piece. Burs consist of two parts:
●The shaft fits into the handpiece.
· The head is the cutting end.
Operative Bur Types
FIGURE 2.132. Thumb control chuck.
Carbide steel burs (carbides) are used for cutting and
are the most commonly used burs.
Diamond points (diamonds) are burs covered with
 bits of industrial diamonds used for crown preparation,
bone smoothing (alveoloplasty), scarification, and shap-
ing teeth (odontoplasty).
Burs have three types of shanks:
 Straight handpiece burs have long straight shanks. In
dental supply catalogs, they are abbreviated as SH or
HP.
· Latch-type burs have notched shanks and are abbre-
viated as LA (latch-type-angle) or RA (right-angled).
· Friction grip burs have smooth shanks, which are
smaller in diameter than HP burs. They are used in
high-speed and slow-speed (contra-angle) hand-

pieces. Friction grip burs are identified as FG,
FG:SL, or SU (friction grip surgical), or FG:SS (fric-
tion grip short shank used for tight areas and
restorations). Surgical burs have longer (25 mm)
shanks used to reach into deep recesses; restorative
burs/shanks are shorter (20 mm).
Bur Shapes and Sizes
Burs come in several sizes, represented by numbers. The
lower the number in a series, the smaller the bur head:

EOUIPMENT MAINTENANCE
Dental handpieces are precision instruments and must
be maintained properly to ensure optimal operation and
maximum life. The veterinarian or technician should
check with the manufacture's instructions for specific
care.
A generic lubrication/sterilization process consists of
these steps:

Replacing the High-Speed Turbine
The turbine is secured in the high-speed handpiece head
by a screwed faceplate. After the faceplate is unscrewed
using the manufacturer-supplied tool, the turbine can be
easily replaced (Figures 2.148-2.152).
FIGURE 2.151. Open turbine.

 To clean and lubricate the low-speed handpiece and
attachments, use the following steps:
1. Place the working end of the handpiece into a small
 bottle of handpiece-cleaning solvent (Schein 772-
5718, CBi handpiece solvent, Burns 952-1065)

Compressor Maintenance
OLL LEVEL  Oil-cooled compressors are equipped with
a dipstick or view port to monitor the oil level. The
owner's manual should be checked for the recom-
mended replacement oil if needed (Schein 100-4746
VetBase oil) (Figure 2.158).
Condensation in the air storage tank accumulates
with each use. The accumulated fluid should be drained
daily/weekly or monthly depending on use and ambient
humidity (Figure 2.159).
Table 2.2 lists the recommended schedule for preven-
tative compressor/storage tank maintenance.
INFECTION CONTROL
Disinfection is the process of destroying microbial life
by placing instruments in a solution (Example: Cidex)
for a specified period. Chemical disinfection does not 
eliminate all viruses and spores.
 Sterilization kills all microorganisms. The autoclave
is a steam chamber for sterilizing instruments. During
the sterilization cycle, distilled water flows into the
chamber and is heated to create steam. Because the
chamber is sealed, pressure increases to approximately

Apnea monitors alert the clinician when the patient's

monitors detect exhaled airflow. The sensor is attached
between the endotracheal tube and the anesthesia

Periodontal disease is the most common ailment affect-
ing small animals. Frequently, patients presented for
"routine teeth cleaning and examination" have peri-
odontal disease. The decision to extract, perform flap
surgery, apply local antibiotics, or only clean and pol-
ish, is made by visual examination, probing depths, and
radiographs.
Logistically, when the patient is admitted to the hos-
pital for dental evaluation and care, the pet owner can-
not receive an accurate treatment plan until a thorough
tooth-by-tooth assessment is conducted. The client is
encouraged to return to the office or call at a preset time,
or is paged usually 2 or 3 hours later to discuss the treat-

The following is a sample timeline for one patient
(additional patients are fitted into the schedule depend-
ing on availability of anesthesia units and staff:

radiography machine, the tube head (without a cone)
should be placed 12-16 inches from the area of interest.
Dental lead-lined cones are available in a variety of
 lengths from 4-16 inches. The end of a 4 inch cone may
be 8 inches from the x-ray generator. An 8 inch exten-
sion (using a 4 inch cone) is referred to as short cone
technique; longer extensions result in a long cone tech-
nique. Exposure adjustments are necessary to accom-
modate different cone lengths. Generally, short cone

preferable because it uses less exposure and is easier to
position. The long cone technique, however, produces
films with increased detail (Figure 4.17).

Two types of radiation apply to operator safety:
Primary radiation comes from direct exposure from
the x-ray beam. The veterinarian or staff should
never hold film or digital sensors in the patient's
mouth with bare or gloved fingers. Film or sensors
can be positioned in the mouth using the endotra-
cheal tube, clay encased in a plastic bag, gauze, thin
wash cloth, or crumpled newspapers, decreasing
operator exposure.
Secondary (scatter) radiation reflects from areas that
have been irradiated by the primary beam. Protective

worn at all times in the veterinary office. It measures the
amount and type of radiation an individual is exposed to
in the working environment. The badge should not be

The film can be attached to a film holder (Film Tran
carrier, Bisco International, Inc.) to carry the film
through the standard automatic film processor on a
cardboard sheet. Film holders permit transport of
 number 2 and 4 dental films. The sheet is developer-
and fixer-resistant.
 The technique for using a film holder includes the
following steps:
1. Remove the film wrapper in the darkroom.
2. Remove the protective liner from the carrier win-
 dow, exposing adhesive.
3. Place the film into the window frame and press
firmly around the edges.

QUALITY CONTROL
A good radiograph is useless unless it is read accurate-
ly,and a poor radiograph cannot be read accurately.
Daily, a quality assurance film should be exposed to
verify that all parts of the dental radiography system are
working properly. Use of an aluminum step wedge helps
accomplish this goal. The step wedge is composed of
 graduated pieces of aluminum placed to produce a step
effect (Burns 998-6484, Schein 263-3389) (Figure

CHAPTER 4

To use a step wedge to establish a control radi-

1. Lay a dental film tab-side-down on a flat surface.

 Place a step wedge over the film.
 3. Use medium-dog technique to expose the film
(Figure 4.61).
 4. Process the film using new chemicals in a light-
secured area.
The processed image should show 10 shades of vary-
ing densities, from light gray to black. Using fresh
chemicals, if all 10 steps are not apparent, adjust the
exposure up or down until all can be distinctly seen. If

sure is determined, this becomes the control film. Thirty
reference films are exposed but not processed.
Reference films should be stored in a refrigerator
(Figure 4.62).
The control film is placed on the view box. Every
day, one of the pre-exposed reference films is developed
to confirm that the density (overall darkness of the
image) and contrast (number of visible steps of the
wedge) remain constant when compared to the baseline
film. If they are not identical, the correct processing
time and temperature are verified. If more than two
steps are lighter than the control film, and other vari-
ables have not changed, the developing and fixing solu-
tions should either be replenished or changed (Figure
4.63).
Film quality encompasses many variables:
· Detail is the delineation of minute structure. kVp
 and the developing process control detail.
FIGURE 4.63. Example of film processed in exhausted
chemicals—-cannot identify all steps.
DENTAL RADIOGRAPHY
83
 Definition is the distinctness and demarcation of the
detail that makes up the radiographic image. For
example, adequate definition is present when the
apical lamina dura, periodontal ligament space, and
individual trabeculae can be clearly demarcated
around a healthy tooth. Definition is controlled by
distance, focal spot size, type of film, and motion.
 Density is the degree of blackness created on film.
Density is controlled predominantly by mAs. Settings
of 10-12.5 mAs provide proper density.
·Contrast is the relative difference between densities.
High-contrast film appears black and white. Low-
contrast films demonstrate many shades of gray.
Contrast is controlled by kVp (normally between
40-75) and processing variables (temperature, devel-

was at fault, place a coin on top of an open unex-

Then process the film. If an outline of the coin
shows, there is a light leak in the darkroom.

to the mesial root of the second premolar in the dog
and distal to the apex of the canine tooth in the cat.
The middle mental foramen may radiographically

CHAPTER 4
INTERPRETING DENTAL
RADIOGRAPHS
Dental radiographs, when correlated with clinical
examination and case history, are important diagnostic
aids available to the veterinary dentist.
Periodontal Radiographic Anatomy
The alveolar margin is the cortical border of the alveo-
lar process positioned approximately 1-2 mm apical to
the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) in the dog and 1/2-1
mm in the cat. The shape of the alveolar margin varies
from pointed to flat. The rostral alveolar margins
appear sharply pointed. Normal cheek teeth alveolar
 margins appear parallel or flat between adjacent cemen-
toenamel junctions (Figure 4.90A).
The lamina dura is a radiographically visible, thin
radiopaque line that represents a layer of compact bone
lining the alveolus. The lamina dura is not a structure in
 its own right, but represents dense cortical bone contin-
uous with the alveolar margin. Lamina dura appears
dense and uniform in the younger animal, becoming ill-
defined in the aged patient or in various disease states
(Figure 4.90B).
The lamina dura of each tooth should be inspected to

animals and narrows with advancing age (Figure
4.90C). The PDLS also appears wider due to tooth
mobility in the presence of periodontal disease. With
disease, the periodontal ligament space varies, indicat-
ing that involvement is not consistent around the entire
root (Figure 4.91). When viewing the lamina dura and
the periodontal ligament, only the interproximal por-
tions are visible. The buccal and lingual areas are not
seen in the radiograph.
Radiologic Interpretation of
Periodontal Disease
STAGES OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE  Periodon-
tal disease can be classified from Stages 1 to 4 based on
severity of radiographic and clinical signs. Normally,
interdental bone appears 1-2 mm apical to the cemen-
toenamel junction.

91
cent of the bone has to be destroyed before bone loss
can be radiographically visualized. The radiograph is
used indirectly to determine amount of bone loss.
Distribution of bone loss is classified as either localized
or generalized, depending on the number of areas affect-
ed. Localized bone loss occurs in isolated areas.
Generalized bone loss involves the majority of the
crestal bone.
 Stage 1, gingivitis, occurs when the gingiva appears
 inflamed. In Stage 1 disease there is no periodontal sup-
 port loss or radiographic changes.
Stage 2, early periodontitis, occurs when attachment

Stage 2 disease appears as blunting (rounding) of the
alveolar margin. There may also appear to be a loss of

continuity of the lamina dura at the level of the alveolar
margin (Figure 4.92).
Stage 3, established periodontitis, is diagnosed when
25-50% of attachment loss occurs.
 The direction of bone loss may be borizontal or ver-
tical (angular) (Figure 4.93):
 Horizontal bone loss radiographically appears as
decreased alveolar marginal bone around adjacent
teeth. Normally, the crestal bone is located 1-2 mm
apical to the cementoenamel junction. With horizon-
tal bone loss, both the buccal and lingual plates of
bone, as well as interdental bone, have been resorbed.
Clinically, horizontal bone loss is typified by
suprabony pockets, which occurs when the epithelial
attachment is coronal to the bony defect (Figure 4.94).
FIGURE 4.94. Horizontal bone loss around the
mandibular fourth premolar and first molar.
· Vertical bone loss, resulting from infrabony (intra-
bony if three-walled) defects, occurs when the walls
of the pocket are within a bony housing. Periodontal
disease may cause a vertical defect to extend apical-
ly from the alveolar margin. At first, the defect is sur-
rounded by three walls of bone: two marginal (lin-
gual or palatal and facial) and a hemisepta (the bone
of the interdental septum that remains on the root of
the uninvolved adjacent tooth). As disease progress-
es, two-, one-, and no-walled (cup) defects may
occur Radiographically, vertical bone defects are
 generally V-shaped and are sharply outlined (Figure
4.95).

with the alveolar bone through calcification of the peri-
odontal ligament. The tooth root becomes fused to the
alveolar wall. Radiographically, there will be no peri-
odontal ligament space (Figure 4.105).
Radiologic Interpretation of
Endodontic Disease
 Radiography is essential for evaluation of a tooth affect-
ed by endodontic disease. The pulp is contained within
the pulp cavity of the tooth. Pulp tissue appears radi-
olucent. Radiographs of an endodontically affected
 tooth are examined for the following:

· Periapical lesions, widened periodontal ligament
space at the tooth's apex, and periapical radiolucen-
cy secondary to bone resorption
 Relative canal widths compared to adjacent or con-
tralateral teeth (Figure 4.106).
PERIAPICAL DISEASE
Periapical  disease  is a
pathologic process surrounding the apex of one or more
roots that occurs as an extension of periodontal disease,
inflammation, or necrosis of the dental pulp from
trauma or infection. Radiographic appearance of peri-
 apical disease includes the following:

EXTERNAL ROOT RESORPTION
External root
resorption may result from periapical inflammation,
excessive occlusal forces, or from unknown stimuli.
 Radiographically, external resorption will appear as
irregular loss of root structure, which can occur in any
area of the root surface (Figures 4.111-4.113).
ENDODONTIC-PERIODONTIC LESIONS
Class I
endoperio lesions are primary endodontic lesions which
exhibit a radiolucent halo that extends coronally from
the root apex eventually reaching the gingival sulcus,
causing a secondary periodontal lesion. The pattern of
bone loss often resembles a J shape (Figure 4.114).

occur when the loss of attachment extends uniformly
apically to a lateral canal or to the apical delta leading
to pulpal necrosis. Class II perioendo lesions often affect
the mandibular first molar and appear as one "floating"
root without alveolar support, with a periapical
endodontic lesion affecting the other tooth root (Figure

external resorption.
INTERNAL RESORPTION  Internal resorption arises
from the pulp. The cause is unknown, but trauma or
pulpal death from anachoresis (bacteria gaining access
to the injured pulp through vascular channels) are
believed to be contributing factors. Often, it is difficult
to determine whether a lesion is due to internal or exter-
nal resorption. If a normal-appearing root canal is visu-
alized radiographically, the lesion is considered external
in origin (Figures 4.117-4.120).
CONDENSING OSTEITIS Condensing osteitis occurs
in response to low-grade infection. It appears as a radio-
dense area around the apex of a tooth (Figure 4.121).

1 5/8-inch. The most commonly used gauges are 27 and
30. The 1-inch “short" needle is used for local infiltra-
tion of anesthesia and the 1 5/8-inch "long" needle is
used for deeper block anesthesia. The tip of the needle
 is beveled. During injection, the bevel is turned toward

Dosage
 Bupivacaine hydrochloride (Marcaine) with epinephrine
is commonly used in veterinary dentistry. The maximum
recommended dosage for dogs and cats is 2 mg/kg (total
dosage divided over the number of sites that need to be
anesthetized). While the recommended volume for local
anesthesia is 0.1-0.5 ml per site in the canine, and 0.1-
0.3 ml per site in the feline, an extra 0.1-0.2 ml can be
injected for the infraorbital block to anesthetize the cau-
dal superior alveolar nerve branches.

teeth. The rostral superior alveolar nerve branches off
the infraorbital nerve just before it exits from the infra-
 orbital canal. These branches supply innervation to the
maxillary canine teeth and incisors. The infraorbital
artery and vein travel with the infraorbital nerve within
the canal and should be avoided when injecting a local
anesthetic solution.
For medium and large dogs, 0.25-0.5 ml of bupiva-
caine is injected. The infraorbital foramen can be pal-
pated as a depression in the alveolar mucosa usually
found apical to the distal root of the maxillary third
premolar. The distal extent of the infraorbital canal can
be estimated by palpating the caudal ventral margin of
the bony orbit. The needle is placed rostrocaudal (hori-
zontal) to the entrance of the foramen. Before injection,
the syringe is aspirated in several directions to make
sure the tip is not intravascular (Figures 5.7-5.10).
Local anesthetic diffusion at the maxillary foramen

Subgingival calculus is preceded by supragingival
 plaque, which loosens the seal between tooth and
gingiva. Calculus is always covered with bacteria

 Calculus plays a role in maintaining and accelerating
periodontal disease by keeping plaque in close contact
with gingival tissues, decreasing the potential for repair
and new attachment. The therapeutic importance of
removing all calculus cannot be overemphasized.

THE FOUR STAGES OF
PERIODONTAL DISEASE
There are numerous grading systems used to classify
gingivitis and periodontal disease. Generally, gingivitis
is used to describe soft tissue inflammatory changes.
Periodontitis is diagnosed when attachment loss has
occurred. The patient can be “graded" by the worst
tooth (i.e., if there is one stage 4 area, the patient has
stage 4 disease). After the disease has been treated, the
 patient can be reclassified.
 Stage 1 (gingivitis) appears as gingival inflammation 
at the free gingival margin. As gingivitis progresses,
advanced gingivitis appears as gingival inflamma-
tion, edema, and bleeding on probing. Advanced gin-

nective tissue. There is no tooth mobility or attach-
ment loss. Gingivitis is reversible with proper thera-
py and aftercare at home (Figures 6.9,6.10).
 Stage 2 (early periodontitis) occurs when there is api-
cal migration of the junctional epithelium, resulting
in a deeper sulcus called a pocket, or gingival reces-
sion. In stage 2 disease, up to 25% attachment loss
occurs (Figure 6.11).
 Stage 3 (established periodontitis) is present when
25-50% attachment loss exists around a root. Slight
tooth mobility often occurs in single-rooted teeth.
 Early furcation exposure and/or gingival recession
may or may not exist (Figure 6.12).
Stage 4 (advanced periodontitis) presents when
marked (greater than 50%) attachment loss occurs.

FURCATION INVOLVEMENT
The furcation is a normal anatomical area at the trunk
of a multirooted tooth where the roots begin to diverge.
Normally this area is sealed from the oral environment
by the periodontium. Furcation involvement, invasion,

tion of alveolar bone and periodontal ligament is
intact at the furcation. Generally, there will be less
than 1 mm exposure (Figure 6.22).
· Class I involvement occurs when an explorer can
enter the furcation, but does not exit the other side.
The undermined furcation is occluded by gingiva or
bone on one side (Figures 6.23,6.24).
 Class Ill exposure is diagnosed when the periodon-
tium is destroyed to such a degree that the furcation
is open and exposed. An explorer can pass from side
to side (Figure 6.25).
Radiographs are helpful in locating furcation
involvement. The slightest radiographic change in the
furcation area should be  investigated  clinically.
 Diminished radiodensity in the furcation suggests furca-
tion exposure (Figure 6.26).
Furcation involvement usually carries a guarded-to-

CHRONIC ULCERATIVE
PARADENTAL STOMATITIS
(CUPS)
Chronic ulcerative paradental stomatitis (CUPS), also
 referred to as contact ulcers or kissing lesions, appears
as marked ulceration of the buccal mucosa adjacent to
calculus and plaque-laden teeth. Affected animals (often
Maltese, and other small breeds) may have a hyperim-
mune response to plaque (Figure 6.27).
CUPS patients should be evaluated medically, includ-
ing organ function profiles, thyroid function, autoim-
mune disease evaluation, urinalysis, and lesion biopsy
to rule out other causes of stomatitis. In patients where
elevated alkaline phosphatase values are reported, tests
to rule out Cushing's disease should also be performed.

 periodontal disease should be extracted. Antibiotics are
indicated to help control infection. Pain medication is
also indicated. Use of the CO2 laser to photovaporize
the lesions has also been used to treat the ulcers, with
mixed results. The use of steroids in control of CUPS is
controversial. Home care, including daily teeth brush-
ing; application of a gel and/or oral rinse containing
 zinc might be helpful in controlling plaque and for ulcer
care. If initial therapy and weeks of home care are not
effective, extraction of the rubbing teeth is usually cur-
ative.

Intraoral radiography provides critical information
the supportive bone mesial (rostral) and distal to the
affected teeth. Unfortunately, due to superimposition, it
is difficult to radiographically evaluate the lingual-buc-
cal plane.
 If clinically and radiographically greater than 50%
of the bone and tooth support remains, periodontal
procedures together with a healthy patient and stringent
home care will often result in a saved tooth. A guarded
prognosis is given when 50-75% bone loss exists. If
greater than 75% support is lost, the prognosis for sav-

CHAPTER 6
Before treatment of the animal, the clinician should
obtain general and dental/oral history, review pre-oper-
ative diagnostics, and interview the client concerning
expectations and abilities to provide aftercare.
STEP 1Visual oral examination on the unanesthetized
animal. The face is examined visually for swellings and
by palpation for areas of tenderness. The assessable
lymph nodes are palpated for pain, texture, and size.
The mouth is opened and closed to check the occlusion
and pain or crepitus of the temporomandibular joints.
The number of teeth is counted in each quadrant. The
lips, tongue, palate, pharynx, teeth, and gingiva are
examined for lesions. Even a small amount of plaque
trixie
 touching the gingiva is abnormal. Often, fractured teeth
have more calculus than the other teeth from chewing
on the opposite side due to pain and discomfort (Figure
6.38).
STEP 2   Visual oral examination under general anes-
thesia after the patient is intubated, cuff is secured and
inflated, and ophthalmic ointment is applied to the
corneal surfaces. The patient is positioned in lateral or

PERIODONTAL EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND TECHNIQUES

STEP 3  Intraoral radiography helps the practitioner
 diagnose periodontal lesions below the gingiva (Figure
6.40).
STEP 4  Supragingival plaque and calculus removal is
accomplished with the help of hand instruments and/or
power scaling equipment. Before the actual teeth clean-
ing procedure is started, the oral cavity is irrigated with
 0.12% chlorhexidine solution. Ultrasonic beavertail or
P-10 tips are designed for gross debridement of
supragingival calculus (Figures 6.41,6.42).
Periodontal bactericidalultrasonic debridement is a
term used to describe supra- and subgingival treatment to
remove plaque, plaque-retentive calculus, and toxic by-
products. The removal of irritants within the gingival sul-
cus is accomplished using periodontal ultrasonic scalers.
FIGURE 6.42. Ultrasonic instrument used to clean the

pressions and rarefactions. During the low-pressure rar-
efaction cycle, microscopic bubbles are formed. Through
the high-pressure compression cycle, the bubbles collapse
or implode. These implosions produce shock waves
called cavitation, which may disrupt the bacterial cell
wall and lead to bacterial cell death.
Acoustic streaming occurs when a continuous tor-
rent of water produces tremendous pressure within the
confined space of the periodontal pocket, resulting in a
decreased number of bacteria. Gram-negative motile
rods in particular are sensitive to acoustic streaming
because of their thin cell walls.
STEP 5 Subgingival periodontal cleaning and root
planing (if indicated). Periodontal disease occurs sec-
ondary to the imbalance of subgingival bacteria with
the host. The goal of teeth cleaning is to remove irritat-
ing plaque and calculus from the gingival sulcus. Calcu-
lus, coated with bacteria, left on the root surface
contributes to the progression of disease. If subgingival
cleaning is not performed, the teeth have not been ade-
quately cleaned. Subgingival root cleaning can be
accomplished with curettes or special ultrasonic peri-
odontal subgingival inserts (Hu-friedy) manufactured
for subgingival use. The Fineline tips are only for clean-
ing the root surface. Using them for supragingival calcu-
lus removal will often lead to tip breakage (Figures
6.43, 6.44).
Disclosing agents are organic dyes that reveal areas
of dental plaque. Disclosing agents are useful both diag-
nostically and in assessing the efficiency of cleaning pro-
cedures. The disclosing solution can be swabbed on the
tooth surfaces using cotton pledgets, after the teeth
cleaning procedure and before the animal is awakened.
Stained calculus and plaque are visualized and removed.
The disclosing solution may also be applied in the exam

Air Polishing
Air polishing uses sodium bicarbonate to "sandblast"
the tooth surface smooth in addition or as a replace-

 To use an air polisher, a source of compressed air,
 CO2 or nitrogen, plus water is necessary. The air mixes
with water and sodium bicarbonate crystals creating an
abrasive slurry, which removes minor stains and partic-

 ulate matter on the tooth surface. Advantages of air pol-
ishing include lack of potential iatrogenic pulpal ther-
mal damage and the ability to polish hard-to-reach
areas.
 Follow these steps when performing air polishing as
 a prophylaxis technique:
When using the air polisher, place a cuffed endotra-
cheal tube in the patient and gauze sponges in the
 oropharynx to pre vent aspiration.
+
 For patient protection, apply eye ointment and place
a towel over the eyes.
·Avoid striking the unkeritinized tissue. Air polishing
should not be used on exposed cementum or dentin
(Figures 6.56-6.58).
· Place the tip of the air polishing nozzle 3-4 mm
slightly apically on the incisal to the middle 1/3 of
the tooth. Using a constant circular motion, sweep
around the tooth. Do not direct the tip into the sul-
cus (Figure 6.59).

also be used as part of the home care process twice daily
for 2 weeks followed by daily application for patients
affected with periodontal disease (Hexarinse, Virbac

be based on the degree of disease and the client's ability
to provide aftercare. Progress visits are initially sched-
uled weekly until the owner is comfortable with the
home care process. Thereafter, advanced periodontal
cases should be rechecked every other week to monthly.
Pets that have been treated for stage 1 or 2 disease, and
whose teeth are brushed once or twice daily, could be
rechecked every 6 months. The reminder interval for
recheck can be linked by computer to the degree of peri-
odontal disease (i.e., if the patient is treated for grade 3
periodontal disease, a monthly progress reminder can
be automatically generated).

sions are structured, by the number of walls remaining
around the tooth. An infrabony defect is shaped like a
box that has no top. The floor of the box is the base of
the pocket. One side of the box or pocket is next to the
root surface that has undergone attachment loss. The
missing box top corresponds to the entrance to the
 pocket. The three remaining sides of the box are the
potential walls of the defect.
Three-wall (intrabony) defects occur when the soft
tissue that lines the pocket is surrounded with three
sides of bone and one tooth surface (example: canine
palatal defect). Three-walled pockets carry the best
 prognosis for eventual bone fill after periodontal thera-
py (Figure 6.72).
Two-wall bony defects are bordered by two osseous
walls and two tooth surfaces (Figure 6.73).
One-wall defects occur when only one wall of bone

 Laterally Positioned (Pedicle) Flap
A laterally positioned pedicle flap is an advanced surgi-
cal procedure that is indicated where a localized gingi-
val cleft exposes the tooth's root. The apical portion of
the cleft defect is usually bound by alveolar mucosa and
frequently found in an inflamed state. If the mesial and
distal interadicular bone bordering such a defect has
normal bone height, the laterally positioned pedicle
graft can partially cover the denuded root when healed.
The laterally positioned flap surgery should not be
attempted in teeth that are mobile due to periodontal

whose caregiver cannot provide adequate aftercare.
 Use the following technique to create a lateral posi-
tioned flap:
1. Make a vertical incision 2-3 mm on each side of the
defect. The vertical incisions on either side of the
defect are designed differently. The incision on the
side away from the donor site is beveled toward the
 defect to create a broad recipient connective tissue
surface for suturing. The vertical incision on the
same side as the donor tissue is beveled away from
the defect. The pedicles are elevated further than
the mucogingival line because periosteum of the 
attached gingiva does not allow stretching. The 
beveled incisions should be generous enough to
allow about 3 mm beyond the denuded root for
 placement and suturing of the donor flap (Figures

PALATAL DEFECT SURGERY
Canine palatal defect therapy is indicated in cases where
there is >25% attachment loss on the palatal aspect of
one or both maxillary canine teeth, and the periodontal
probe does not enter the nasal cavity. When deep pock-
ets are diagnosed, pocket therapy should be performed
or the tooth extracted and the defect closed. If untreat-
ed, the pocket will usually progress until it penetrates
the nasal cavity (Figure 6.120).
 Use this technique for palatal pocket therapy:
1. Make 4-8 mm mesial and distal incisions to the
bone at 20° angles palatally from the affected tooth
(Figure 6.121).
 2. Use a Molt or Freer periosteal elevator to gently
raise a full-thickness flap (Figure 6.122).
FIGURE 6.122. Palatal defect exposed with a periosteal

Oronasal fistulas result from periodontal disease of the
maxillary teeth, creating communication between the
oral and nasal cavities. Oronasal fistulas allow fluid and

Double-Layer Oronasal Fistula Repair
The double-flap technique to repair oronasal fistulas is
used where the fistula is chronic, large, or when a more
predictable outcome is needed than that with the single-
layer closure. In the double-flap technique, part of the
palatal soft tissue is used to cover the defect; the result-
ing palate defect area is then covered with buccal
mucosa to ensure a double seal:
 1. Excise the buccal mucosal edge of the fistula to pro-
vide a fresh clean surface for primary healing.
Leave the soft tissue lining the palatal edge of the

canine tooth in a dog, predisposing it to periodontal

MANDIBULAR FRENECTOMY
Frenula are tough bands of tissue connecting the inside
surfaces of the lip to the mandibular gingiva behind
canine teeth and between the lip and maxillary central
incisors. In the presence of marked periodontal disease,
the frenulum attachment may trap food and debris
against inflamed labial gingiva (Figure 6.132).
Mandibular frenectomy is indicated in patients with
gingival recession or pocket formation on the distal
labial side of mandibular canine teeth or when peri-
odontal disease around the maxillary central incisors is
caused or aggravated by a tight frenulum. By excising
the attachment, food will not accumulate as readily in
the affected areas.
Frenectomy is performed with the following tech-
nique:
1. Local anesthesia.
 2. Dissect the frenulum close to the gingival margins 
with a scalpel blade, iris scissors, radiosurgery, or
laser (Figures 6.133,6.134)
3. Suture the detached labial mucosa close to the
periosteum.
 4. Root plane the exposed abnormal cemental surface.
GINGIVAL HYPERPLASIA (GH)
Relative, pseudo-, or false pockets exist when there is
gingival enlargement (hyperplasia) without destruction
 of periodontal tissues. If gingival hyperplasia is greater
than 2-3 mm when probed, the treatment of choice to

and post-operatively to protect the tooth.
At one time, gingivectomy was the treatment of
choice to eliminate pocket depth and to allow exposure
of the root surface for cleaning. Although gingivectomy
may eliminate a suprabony pocket, healing time of
exposed tissue is longer than a repositioned flap proce-
dure. Gingivectomies should be used only in cases of
 gingival hyperplasia where there is an overgrowth of tis-
sue and at least 2 mm of attached gingiva remains after
surgery.
Use the following steps for gingivectomy afer local

1. Place a periodontal probe onto the pseudo-pocket
floor, then outside to the measured depth, making
slight indentions or bleeding points on the gingiva

HEMISECTION TO SAVE PART
OF THE TOOTH
 Furcation exposure occurs secondary to periodontal
 disease. In Class I and ClassI disease, periodontal ther-
apy together with a patient able to accept aftercare may
result in a saved tooth. Goals of furcation exposure
therapy are to decrease pocket depth, eliminate bony
lesions, and create a cleanable tooth that is easier to
 clean to decrease further invasion.

Tooth Brushing Technique
Tooth brushing should be at the same time each day.
Before dinner works well using the meal as a reward for
cooperating. Follow these steps:
1. Place the pet's head at a 4.5° angle.
 2. With the same hand used to hold the head up, pull 
the commisure of the lips backward, exposing the
cheek teeth, while keeping the mouth closed (Figure 
6.149).
3. Rub the toothbrush bristles in small circular
motions under the gum line at a 45° angle to the
gingiva. Generally, only the outside (facial) surfaces

 progress, not perfection. Reward progress immedi-

ing session.
Each pet is different. Some will be trained in 1 week,
and others will take a month or more.
In the author's opinion, scalers and/or curettes
should not be used by clients. Hand scaling without
 proper chemical immobilization and training can injure
the gingiva or tooth.
Toothpaste (dentifrice) is used to help clean and pol-
ish the tooth surfaces. Human toothpaste should not be
used on dogs and cats because it contains detergents
and fluoride, which may be irritating to the stomach
when swallowed.

Plaque Retardants
Salivary peroxidase enzyme-enhanced products (C.E.T.,
Virbac Products) bind to plaque. Peroxidases are found
in a number of biologic fluids and in saliva. The anti-
bacterial action of salivary peroxidase takes place
because of the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of thio-
cyanate. The mode of action for salivary peroxidase
appears to include inhibition of bacterial enzymes con-
 taining essential thiol groups:

ly innervated connective tissue. When traumatized, the
pulp reacts to irritants through inflammation. If
untreated, inflammation spreads up and/or down the
pulp, eventually becoming irreversible. Toxic products 
from damaged tissue and microorganisms in the tissue
sustain inflammation (Figures 7.1, 7.2, 7.3).
The pulp cavity consists of a pulp chamber located in
the crown and root canal in the root. An apical delta
containing minute openings is present at the root apex.
Soft tissues in the pulp cavity include blood vessels,
sensory nerves, connective tissue, and undifferentiated
cells. Odontoblasts, which form dentin throughout the
tooth's life, line the pulp cavity wall. Before eruption,
the odontoblasts produce primary dentin. Once the root
formation has neared completion, the odontoblasts pro-
duce secondary dentin causing the dentinal walls to
thicken and decreasing the pulp cavity size. Reparative
or tertiary dentin is produced in response to thermal,
mechanical, occlusal, or chemical trauma to the odon-
toblasts.

INSTRUMENTS USED TO
ENDODONTICALLY CARE FOR
FRACTURED TEETH
The goal of conventional endodontics is to remove tox-
 ins, microbes, and necrotic debris by thoroughly debrid-
ing the pulp cavity and then sealing the space to prevent
further infection. Burs, files, broaches, spreaders, and
pluggers are used to accomplish this goal. It is essential
that endodontic instruments and accessories are sterile
before placement into the canal. A sterilized endodontic
pack can be prepared with the necessary instruments.

Endodontic files are used to enlarge, debride, shape,
and smooth the root canal to clean the canal and pre-
 pare for obturation (Figure 7.22).
FIGURE 7.19. Barbed broach fine hooks used to grab
the pulp for removal.
FIGURE 7.22. Three 21 mm endodontic files inserted
into a maxillary fourth premolar's root canals.
Kerr (K) files cut or shave the canal on insertion and
withdrawal. K files are used in a push-in/pull-out fash-
ion, or with a 1/4 turn after the file is extended to its
apical base before withdrawal. K files are stronger and
 more flexible than Hedstrom files and less prone to
breakage. File length chosen depends on the root canal
length from tooth access to apex. Files can be purchased
in groups of five in one size or assorted sizes.
K files are available in the following lenths:
· 21 mm length (Burns #30 951-2599, #35 951-2601,

Hedstrom (H) files are sharper than K files.
Hedstrom files cut on the up (pull) stroke, and K files
cut on both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations
and on insertion and withdrawal. To prevent a
corkscrew apical penetration, Hedstrom files should not
be rotated. Hedstrom files cut efficiently and quickly,
and they are used when significant removal of dentin is
desired. such as flairing the access in the coronal third
of the tooth. H files are not intended for use in the api-

fatigue, and eventually separate (break). Should the
instrument separate within the root canal, retrieval is
attempted. In some cases, apical surgery or extraction of
the tooth becomes necessary. As instruments are pre-
pared for sterilization, they should be individually
checked for signs of wear, weakness, or fracture. Some
practitioners color-code the files with endodontic stops
relating to the number of times each file is used. The
safest practice is to use new files with each patient. To
mitigate the expense of using fresh files for each case, a
sterile endodontic surgical pack fee can be charged to
the client for each case.
FIGURE 7.31. Endodontic stops.
Rotary files are attached to a high-torque, slow-
speed handpiece of a 10:1 reduction gear contra-angle
to mechanically prepare the canal. Rotary file use is
technique-sensitive. The risk of file fracture and/or root
 perforation is increased if rotary files are not used cor-
rectly (Figure 7.30).
 Endodontic stops are small, round pieces of rubber
or plastic that act as visual references to assist the vet-
erinarian in preparing the canal. The stops are placed
toward the file handle with the assistance of a confirm-
ing radiograph before root canal therapy is initiated,
and readjusted when the file is at the internal apex, as
confirmed by a working-length radiograph. All succeed-
ing files are fitted with endodontic stops at the working
length (Burns 951-9792, Schein 100-5271) (Figures
FIGURE 7.32. Endodontic stop attached to a 60 mm

Spiral paste fillers, also called Lentulo spiral fillers,
are used to mechanically carry root canal sealer cement
into the prepared root canal before placement of gutta
 percha. Spiral fillers may be used by hand or at very low
speeds in a latch-type 10:1 reduction gear contra-angle.
The diameter of the spiral filler used should be slightly
smaller than the anticipated gutta percha size. The
loaded filler is inserted into the pulp chamber without
the spiral filler rotating. After insertion into the canal to
its full length, the handpiece is activated. A clockwise
 pumping motion is used while partially withdrawing the
spiral to unload the sealer cement. (40 mm assorted

FRACTURED TOOTH WITH AN
OPEN APEX
If periapical disease is apparent clinically or radi-

apexification procedures, or extraction should be per-
formed.
 Apexogenesis is the desired outcome when vital pulp

The tooth is examined and radiographed at 3
months and as opportunity arises during future oral
hygiene procedures. In the immature tooth, a radi-
 ographic-visible dentinal bridge should form below the
restoration. The presence of a dentinal bridge does not
guarantee success. On sequential radiographs, the pulp
cavity should appear narrower because of dentin pro-
duction. In the mature tooth, success appears radi-

closed.
1. Remove necrotic contents of the immature root
canal with barbed broaches to a point just short of
the radiographic apex (Figure 7.66). Endodontic
stops are used to help prevent over-instrumenting
the canal. If periapical lesions are present, surgical
exposure and debridement may also be indicated.
2. Frequently irrigate the canal with sterile saline.
Avoid using bleach.
 3. After instrumentation, dry the canal with premea-
sured paper points before placement of the calcium
hydroxide paste. When using paper points, care
must be taken not to disturb the apical tissue, caus-
ing additional hemorrhage (Figure 7.67).
4. Fill the canal with calcium hydroxide/sterile saline
paste (mixed with barium sulfate 8:1). The calcium
hydroxide stimulates cementum to create an apical

point where preservation of the pulp is no longer possi-
ble. Calcium hydroxide is used to bring a bony closure
to the apex. After this has been accomplished, conven-
tional endodontics can be performed. This advanced
 procedure should not be attempted if the clinician is at
 a beginning or intermediate level.
 Even after apexification in the immature patient, the
root and crown will be thin, dry, and weak, which
makes it subject to fracture. The long-term prognosis
for these teeth in large, orally oriented dogs is guarded
even with metallic crown restoration, because the tooth
might fracture between the alveolar crest and margin of
the prosthetic crown (Figures 7.64,7.65).

Accessing the Canal (Coronal Access)
Keep the following general considerations in mind:
· Local anesthetic is injected before the root canal pro-
 cedure is begun.
● Unsupported or fractured tooth components should
be removed, leaving sound structure. This includes
discarding the slab portion of the maxillary fourth
premolar fracture plus rounding of rough edges.
Cat and small dog teeth are usually entered from the
fracture site. In medium and larger dogs, an addition-

through the pulp cavity to the apex. The initial pene-
tration into enamel is made with a No. 2 round car-
bide or diamond bur in a high-speed drill at a right
angle to the crown. (Figure 7.77).
· After the enamel has been pierced, the bur is angled
toward the pulp cavity, removing a section of the 
pulp chamber (Figure 7.78).
 Incisors are accessed either palatally/lingually or
labially. The first (central) and second (intermediate)
incisors are accessed halfway between the gingival mar-
gin and incisal edge. The third incisor is entered one-
quarter the distance from the gingival margin to the
incisal edge (Figure 7.79).
Access to the canine teeth is made on the mesial
aspect of the tooth just coronal to the gingival margin
(Figure 7.80). The maxillary third incisor might inter-
fere with the ideal access to the maxillary canine pulp
chamber. In those cases, a longer surgical length bur

Preparing the Canal-Debridement
and Shaping
Cleaning and shaping procedures are designed to
remove deleterious debris from the root canal system
while producing a smooth funnel shape for complete
filling. This process is called debridement or instrumen-
tation. The thoroughness of debridement facilitates suc-
cessful dimensional sealing during the obturation (fill-
ing) phase.
 Pre-operative radiographs are important to evaluate
the shape of the root. Most small-animal root canals are
slightly curved. Sharply curved canals present a chal-
lenge to the veterinary dentist, particularly if flexible
 NiTi files are not used. If the files used to prepare the

The inside of the curve may be shaved excessively

The apex may become overly enlarged (zipping or

For debridement:
1. Use a barbed broach to remove gross pulpal tissue.
 Barbed broaches work best on intact vital or recent-
ly devitalized pulp contents. Carefully introduce the
broach into the canal until it makes light contact
with the pulpal tissue. Rotate the broach 180° to
engage the pulp and gently pull it back. Take care
 not to break the broach in the pulp cavity. Repeat
the process multiple times to remove the entire

minimal additional filing is necessary (Figures
7.88,7.89).
2. Hedstrom and Kerr files shape and clean the canals.
 Use the working length radiograph to determine the
file length needed to reach the apical terminus.
 Endodontic stops are small round pieces of rubber
or plastic placed on files at the estimated working
length (length from the access to apex). Stops are
applied to prevent placing the instrument too far
into the canal through the apex into the periapical
tissues. Establish the working length when the tip
of the file rests on the apical floor of the canal.
 3. The first file used should just barely engage the
 canal walls when it is carried to the working length.
Hedstrom files can be inserted and partially
removed without rotation. The Hedstrom file

found that does not easily reach the working
length. Then with apical pressure, cut the dentin
until the apex is reached. This file is termed the
master file.
With the step back method, the veterinarian uses 
smaller diameter files nearest the apex progressing
to larger sizes at decreasing distances. Alternatively,
the crown down method may be employed, where
the veterinarian works from the crown of the tooth,
shaping the canal as he or she moves toward the

dentinal debris, dissolve soft tissue, disinfect, and
provide a bleaching effect. Introduce the irrigation
solution by using a slot-ended endodontic needle to
 prevent periapical extrusion of dentin debris and
bleach. Bleach should be employed when the prac-
titioner knows the apex is closed. Irrigate the canal
with sterile saline between the last three file sizes to
remove the hypochlorite irrigation solution (Figures
7.96-7.98). Some practitioners alternate hydrogen
peroxide with the bleach and saline.
10. As the procedure progresses, reinsert the last file
that reached the apex to the full apical extent, to
recapitulate the canal, removing dentinal debris
that might have accumulated near the apex.

Obturation
 Obturation is the three-dimensional filling and sealing
of the entire root canal, preventing leakage and estab-
lishing an environment allowing periapical healing.
After the tooth has been successfully prepared (cleaned
and shaped) and disinfected, the root canal(s) and pulp
chamber(s) are obturated with permanent filling materi-
al. Healing the periapical tissues occurs when the nutri-
tional supply to the bacteria is stopped by the sealing
 properties of obturation (Figure 7.104).
 Use the following steps for obturation:
1. Place a gutta percha master cone (same size as the

remove for application of root canal sealer cement.
2. Use root canal cement to seal the apex, dentinal
tubules, and accessory canals and to fill irregulari-
ties in the canal. Zinc oxide/eugenol (ZOE) (Burns
952-32.50, 951-2081; Schein 100-4540, 100-1757)
is a commonly used sealer. Eugenol might interfere
with composite restoration. The trend is to use cal-
cium hydroxide-based sealers with little to no
eugenol (Sealapex-Kerr) or an intermediate (glass
ionomer, calcium hydroxide) filler if composite
restoration is planned. To merge zinc oxide and
eugenol, mix a dime-sized amount of zinc oxide
 powder and several drops of eugenol liquid to a
creamy consistency with a #5 spatula on a glass
slab for approximately 1 minute. Incorporate small
amounts of powder into the liquid and wipe over a
large area of the mixing pad. Mixing is finished

when a half-inch string of the cement can be drawn
between slab and spatula (Figures 7.105-7.107).
3. Methods used to apply apical sealing cement
include the following:
· For large canals instrumented with greater than
size 40 file, the cement can be loaded on a Lentulo
spiral filler powered by a low-speed handpiece
with a 10:1 contra-angle reduction gear. The spi-
ral is dipped into the cement mix and inserted
approximately halfway into the canal. The spiral
is rotated counterclockwise to distribute the
cement to the apex and onto the dry walls of the
canal. A spreader two sizes smaller than the mas-
ter cone is used to push the sealer to the internal
apex.
· The endodontic master file can be loaded with

apical cement and rotated counterclockwise in the
canal releasing the cement into the apex.
·Gutta percha points can be dipped in sealer
 cement before insertion into the canal carrying
the sealer to the apex (Figures 7.108-7.110).
 4. Use a plugger to vertically compact the gutta percha
apically. The plugger should be slightly smaller than
the root canal width. For canals up to 30 mm, cut
the master cone to 10-15 mm in length, place it in
the canal, and vertically compact it (Figure 7.111).
 5. Use a spreader to laterally compact the master cone
and sealer against the root canal walls (Figure
7.112).
6. Cut multiple accessory cones to 10-15 mm lengths

The SuccessFil core technique uses these steps:
1. The canals are instrumented in a manner that will
 result in a flaring preparation from access to apex.
Ater the apical portion of the canal has been
enlarged to an adequate size, use additional instru-
mentation in the coronal portion of the canal to
assure the flaring preparation. Final instrumenta-
tion should result in a canal in which a file fits
snugly in the apical 1-2 mm and loosely in the
coronal portion of the canal.
FIGURE 7.127. Notching the shaft before placement.
2. Place the SuccessFil syringe into the heater for 15
minutes.
 3. Before final placement, insert a preselected (same
size as file used for the final apical preparation)
sterile titanium core into the canal to the full work-
ing length without binding. If binding occurs, select
 one size smaller.
4. Notch the shaft with a fissure bur at the coronal
access length—enough to break at the desired time
but still maintain sufficient strength for placement
without breaking prematurely (Figure 7.127).

Injection Techniques
 Injection techniques deliver heated, softened, gutta per-

 Obtura Il (Obtura Corporation, SybronEndo) deliv-
ers gutta percha heated to 200* C. in an injection pistol.
The gutta percha is loaded as preformed bullets placed
in the heating chamber of the pistol handpiece. The pis-
tol has a finger control to allow flow of gutta percha
through the disposable applicator needles (20 or 23
gauge) into the presealed canal. Unfortunately, the
smallest-sized injection needle is 0.6 mm in diameter,
necessitating canal preparation to a number 60 file or
larger. Plugger compaction follows the gutta percha
application. Longer lengths used in veterinary dentistry
are available. Obtura II can also be used as a backfill
 after the apical area has been fitted with a master gutta
percha cone (Figure 7.129).

Lateral compaction of warm (heated) gutta percha. A
heated plugger pressed apically can be used to warm
gutta percha in the canal, creating additional room for
 more points. When the heat source is a flame, there is
uncontrolled heating. Electric heat carriers deliver a pre-
cise amount of heat for a specific time. Examples of
electronic heat carrier methods are the System B contin-

the endodontic sealer contains eugenol ( which interferes
with polymerization of composite), glass ionomer
should be applied between the obturation material and
composite:

SURGICAL ENDODONTICS
(APICOECTOMY AND
RETROGRADE FILLING)
Apicoectomy is the surgical excision of the apical por-
tion of a tooth root through an opening in the overlying
bone and oral mucosal tissues. The goal of the apicoec-
tomy is to perfect a biologic apical seal with a retro-
grade filling of the apex. Surgical endodontic care is an
advanced procedure most commonly performed on the
maxillary canine and fourth premolar, and the
mandibular canine and first molar.
The following are indications for surgical endodon-

Surgical endodontics of multiple-rooted teeth are
treated in a similar fashion. The maxillary palatal root
apices of the fouth premolar and molars cannot be sur-

ENDODONTIC-PERIODONTIC
LESIONS
Some animals are affected by both endodontic and peri-
odontal lesions in the same tooth. Communication from
the pulp to the periodontal apparatus can originate
from the tooth's apex or lateral canal(s). To be classified

have at least one root with a necrotic pulp and destruc-
tion of the periodontal attachment extending from the
gingival pocket to the lateral canal or tooth apex.
 Periodontic-endodontic lesions start as periodontal dis-
ease of the tooth, in which bacteria migrates into the
endodontic system through lateral canal(s) or through
the apical delta.
Endodontic/periodontic pathology classification:
公
· Class O lesion is primarily endodontic in origin with
minimal or no periodontal involvement (Figure
7.159).
· Class I endodontic-periodontic (endoperio) lesion is
endodontic in origin and progresses to involve the
 periodontal tissues. Clinically, there is usually a frac-
tured tooth and a draining canal that exits near the
gingival margin. Radiographically, this “J" lesion
with the typical periapical radiolucent halo extend-
ing a thin radiolucent strip coronally along the root
to the gingival margin is pathognomic for endoperio
disease (Figures 7.160-7.166).
· Class II periodontic-endodontic (perioendo) lesion is
periodontal in origin and progresses to invade the
 pulp. Clinically, a periodontal probe usually extends
easily to the apex. Radiographically, there is a
 marked uniform radiolucent area extending from the
gingival margin around the apex of the root.

· Calcium hydroxide powder or paste can be applied
 to the apex using a paper point.
A mummifying agent (Formocresol: Burns 951-
3876, Schein 102-9994) can be applied to a paper
point inserted in the canal (Figure 7.170). The access 
is then sealed with temporary filler, such as Cavit-G
(ESPE America, Inc.) (Burns 878-0360, Schein 378-
4404). Two weeks later, the canal is reopened, the
paper point(s) removed with a small file and the
canal obturated.
Overinstrumentation is the perforation of the apex,
root wall, or pulpal floor during debridement.
Overinstrumentation occurs from:
· Incorrect bur position when searching for the pulp
chamber, which may result in perforating the pulpal
floor
· Excessive pressure placed on the endodontic file,
 especially in a young tooth
· Excessive twisting of the file (usually Hedstrom), act-
ing as a corkscrew perforating the apex
Perforation can occur with chronic lesions and exter-
nal resorption of the apical delta.
Clinically, perforation usually results in persistent
bleeding. When perforation is suspected, sodium
hypochlorite used for irrigation should be discontinued

potential failure is to choose cases wisely based on clin-

resorbed, vertical root fractures, or those affected with
marked support loss are prone to failure even with
advanced salvage procedures.
Persistent hemorrhage is usually due to failure to
remove all the vital pulpal tissue or perforation of the
root. Radiographic examination can confirm perfora-

Incomplete fill is a common endodontic problem,
which occurs when the canal is underinstrumented or
underobturated. If the pulp cavity is not completely
obturated, space or tissue remains, which can lead to
further periapical disease from bacterial leakage. When
radiographs reveal an incomplete fill, the canal should
be reinstrumented to the point of the underfill and
refilled (Figure 7.171).
Overfill occurs occasionally, when sealer cement
and/or gutta percha extrudes from the apex due to

rotation.
 If the file fragment is lodged and broken at the begin-
ning of the procedure, it has to be removed to permit
complete debriding of the canal. If the file cannot be
retrieved, a surgical root canal or extraction is per-
formed. If the file separates after the canal is cleaned
 past a #30 file, it can be left in the patient and followed
clinically and radiographically throughout the patient's
life.
Options for broken file removal include the follow-
ing:
● The separated fragment is hooked with another file
 or barbed broach and gently pulled backward.
· Cancelliers are stiff, fine, hollow tubes used to gain
access to the canal for insertion and retrieval of the
separated file (eie Analytic Technology, CK Dental
Specialties).
 Mounces are channel-cut ball-ended, stainless steel
probes used to retrieve nickel-titanium files (eie
Analytic Technology Specialties).
● Fine forceps can be used to remove the fragment
(Cislak Peets Forceps #5217).
· Ultrasonic handpiece vibrations, when placed
 against the fragment, may dislodge the file.

tooth to normal size and color may not make the tooth
optimally functional because of its inability to hold up
 to repeated trauma. In cases of conflict, function should
prevail.

Light cured resins polymerize when exposed to high
intensity (450 nm) blue light generated by a halogen or 
plasma system. The composite is stored in a lightproof
syringe (compule). The paste contains a photoinitiator
molecule and an amine activator Light cured resins do
not require mixing. When using light cured composites,
the veterinarian has a prolonged amount of working
time to shape the restoration before applying the light
source (Figure 8.6).
Dual-cured composites polymerize partially as the
material is mixed. The final cure occurs when the com-
 posite is exposed to the curing light.
FIGURE 8.7. Light cure "gun."
The curing light consists of a lighted wand, protec-
tive shield, handle, and trigger switch. The light is used
to activate light cured composites and bonding agents.
Most curing lights can penetrate to a depth of 2.0 mm
into the composite. The amount of intensity reaching
composite is related to the age of the bulb, the condition
 of the light-guide and wand, distance of the light from 
the restoration, and time of application (Burns 955-
7400, Schein 100-5151) (Figures 8.7-8.9).
Surgery lights should be diverted from the opera-
tory field during light-cured composite placement.
Any intense light can initiate the hardening
process. Orascoptic (Sybron Dental Specialties)
 produces a high-intensity light source with a light
cure-inhibiting filter.

which must be rated at a minimum of 300 milliwatts per
meter square (mw/cm?) to cure properly. If the power rat-
ing drops to less than 200 mw/cm?, curing time should be
lengthened, or the bulb replaced. The curing light should
 be activated for 10 seconds before testing. Test the curing
light when it is new (Figure 8.10).
ETCHING
Acid etching is a technique wherein maleic acid or phos-
phoric acid is placed on the enamel for a short period
and then rinsed. Etching is used to increase the enamel
bonding surface area and to remove the dentin smear
layer. This allows the bonding agent to penetrate into
the dentin tubules, creating a micromechanical interlock
between the restoration and dentin. Etchants are sup-
plied in either liquid or gel form. Application of the gel
allows the etchant to be carefully placed where it is
needed (Burns 951-9192, Schein Etch gel 100-4649)
(Figure 8.11).
CURE RITE
 Basic etching procedure includes these steps (follow
specific manufacturer's instructions):
VISIBLE CURING LIGHT METER
1. The surface of the tooth is cleaned and polished
with flour of pumice (Figure 8.12).
2. After cleaning, the surface is lightly dried but not
desiccated.
 3. The prepared tooth is protected with gauze to pre-
vent moisture (saliva) from contaminating the
preparation.
4. Etchant is placed and allowed to remain for the
time recommended by the manufacturer (30-40
seconds for enamel, 10-15 seconds for dentin)
(Figure 8.13).
 5. After etching, the surface is thoroughly rinsed for
one minute and lightly dried (Figure 8.14).
6. An etched surface appears frosty white. If the sur-
face does not appear chalky, or has been contami-
nated with moisture, the etching process should be
repeated.
FIGURE 8.10. Curing light meter.

CHAPTER 8
FIGURE 8.14. Rinsing the tooth surface.
BONDING SYSTEMS
Composite resins require bonding agents; glass ionomer
cements do not. Bonding improves retention through
the creation of a micromechanical attachment between
 the tooth structure and the restoration.
Bonding systems are available as self-cured, dual-
cured, and light cured. Systems use one, two, or three 
 liquids and are either single or multistepped.
 During some bonding processes, etchant removes the
smear layer, primer opens the dentin tubules, and adhe-
sive flows into the partially opened tubules.
 Bonding agents are classified by generations:
 FIGURE 8.12. Application of pumice with a polishing
 cup on low-speed handpiece.
· First generation: The etchant is applied and washed
off to remove the dentin smear layer; primer and
adhesive are applied separately.
· Second generation: Etchant is applied and washed
off to remove the smear layer; primer and adhesive
are applied as a single solution.
+
 Third generation: Self-etching primer is applied to
dissolve the smear layer and is not washed off.
 Adhesive is applied separately.
· Fourth generation: Self-etching primer and adhesive
(total-etch technique) are applied as a single solu-
tion, and the surface is left wet to avoid collagen col-
lapse. With fourth-generation bonding systems, the
formation of resin tags and adhesive lateral branch-
es completes the bonding mechanism between the
adhesive materials and etched dentin.
· Fifth generation: There are two different types of fifth
generation bonding systems: the one-bottle system,
FIGURE 8.13. Application of etchant gel using a brush.
which combines the primer and adhesive into one
solution which is applied to etched enamel and dentin;
and the self-etching primer bonding system, which
reduces the working time, eliminating washing.

Prepare pumice polish by mixing flour pumice with

 3. Etching procedure:
a. Place a cotton pellet in a container of 37% phos-
phoric acid etching solution.
 b. Press the pellet lightly on the enamel margins of 
the preparation. Take care to avoid swabbing
acid on the entire enamel surface.
c. After approximately 15 seconds (or according to
 the manufacturer's instructions), rinse the enam-
el thoroughly and dry it with an oil-free air
 source. The surface should appear chalky white
and left dry but not desiccated. If the tooth
becomes overly dry, wet it with a cotton pledget
and gently dry.
FIGURE 8.20. The adhesive is light cured.
4. If the tooth is vital, apply a thin layer of primer to
the exposed dentin. Primer prepares dentin for the
adhesive. It is not necessary to apply primer to
 enamel surfaces. After application, gently air-dry
the dentin primer or rinse according to the manu-
facturer's directions (Figure 8.19).
5. Mix the bonding agent (dental adhesive) according
to the manufacturer's instructions and place it over
the etched enamel. Some bonding agents require
light curing immediately after placement (Figure
8.20).
 6. Using a plastic or aluminum applicator, or injection 
device, place 1-2 mm light cure resin composite in
 increments onto the restoration area (Figure 8.21).
A clear Mylar strip can be used to compress the
composite over the restoration site (Burns 951-

 reaction does not require light to occur. Examples of
these products are Ketac-fil (3M ESPE) and Fuji II

A prosthetic is used to cover the clinical crown of teeth
that have been weakened by decay or damaged by frac-
ture. A restoration helps protect the restored tooth, but
does not make it stronger. The purpose of prosthetic
crown restoration is to prevent further breakdown of
the remaining tooth structure, restore function to the
tooth, and—in some instances—create a "normal" aes-
thetic appearance. In human dentistry, crown restora-
tion is performed after most endodontic procedures,
because a significant amount of the crown is removed
for access. Human teeth are usually in occlusal contact
compared to small animal teeth, which mostly interdig-
itate. In veterinary dentistry, prosthetic crown restora-
tion is a controversial advanced procedure chosen on a
case-by-case basis.
 Indications for crown use include the following:
 Restoration of teeth subject to stress following
endodontic procedures, especially canines, maxillary
fourth premolars, and mandibular first molars 
· Crown protection in patients that chew on objects,
which continue to injure teeth (abrasion)

 Restoration of teeth affected by enamel hypoplasia

 from fracture or leakage after restoration
· Protection of vital teeth that have enamel and dentin
loss with near exposure, potentially decreasing fur-
ther damage and the necessity for endodontic care
There are several types of crowns:
· Full cast or metal crowns completely cover the
exposed portion of an individual tooth. Metal
crowns are manufactured from precious metal
(gold), high noble semiprecious metal (gold/alloy
mix), or nonprecious (nickel or chromium alloy)
materials (Figure 8.39).
Porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crowns are full
metal restorations, with the outer surfaces covered
with a veneer (thin layer) of a tooth-colored sub-

stance baked onto the metallic framework. The
porcelain veneer has the tendency to chip.
 Porcelain crowns are constructed from a thin metal
shell covered by layers of porcelain built up to resem-
ble the shading and translucence of the natural tooth.
Porcelain crowns lack the strength of porcelain-fused-
to-metal crowns (Figure 8.40).
 Sintered ceramic crowns are porcelain/resin mixtures
that are pressed into a corresponding mold and then
baked. Sintered ceramics are strong and are manu-
factured in multiple tooth colors. Examples include
In-Ceram Zirconia (Vident) and Procera AllCeram
(Figure 8.41).

crown cementation. If the crown fits, no adjust-
ments are made and adhesive is applied to the inner
crown surface and the tooth for cementation. If the
crown does not fit, minor adjustments are made to
the crown surface and/or the tooth to improve the
mount. If it still does not fit, the tooth is re-
 prepped, new impressions are taken, and the new
models are sent to the lab.
Crown Preparation
Crown preparation provides a smooth, strong junction
of the tooth with the cast surface. To accomplish this
objective, the height and contour of the tooth are
reduced, resulting in a smaller tooth than the original.
An impression taken of the prepared tooth provides the
laboratory with a negative model for prosthetic crown
fabrication.

The margin is prepared using a diamond bur pow-
ered by a high-speed drill with water irrigation. There
 are many types of diamond burs available, depending
on the veterinarian's choice of marginal finish line. For
example, if a chamfer finish line is desired, a chamfer
diamond bur is used to prepare the tooth.
Types of marginal finish lines include the following:
·Feather (knife edge) margin bevels are angled 70° or
 greater coronally. The advantage of a feathered mar-
 gin is ease of preparation and minimal tooth loss.
Due to the long slope, the fabricating lab may have
difficulty establishing the finish line to determine
crown length. In such cases, the veterinarian should
 indicate where the finish line is on a drawing or
instant picture.
●Chamfer (level) margin finish is popular for metallic
crown restorations. A chamfer finish allows micro-
movement without damage to the tooth margin. It
also permits the lab to make the crown with an
ample gingival margin, which is less technically
exacting than margins that taper to a fine point
(Figure 8.44).
 Deep chamfer finishes consist of a 6° taper with a
rounded transition area to a 45° margin at the finish
line. This prep is used primarily for subgingival fin-
ish lines, in cases of subgingival fracture. Exposure is

wall (butt) or a 6° taper (tapered shoulder) transi-
tioning to a 90° margin at the finish line. Shoulder
margins do not allow micromovement and are rec-
ommended when restoring the tooth with porcelain,
ceramic, or PFM crowns. A disadvantage of a shoul-
der margin is the loss of tooth mass to form the joint
(Figure 8.45).
Taper
The tooth should be prepared with a taper of 5-6° from
the parallel sides. Less taper makes seating and cement-
 ing the crown difficult, because air and cement have lit-
tle room to escape during cementation. Excessive taper 
reduces surface area available for retention and weak-
ens the crown.

ration without undercuts will enable the veterinarian to
view the entire tooth surface and margin while looking
straight down the crown with one eye (Figure 8.46).
Rotational Stability
Rotational stability is a concern when there is minimal
tooth remaining above the gingiva and the prepared sur-
face approximates a cylindrical cone. To prevent rota-
tion of the crown, retention grooves may be cut in the
 tooth. These grooves should be parallel to each other
and the long axis of the crown. They should be deep
enough to offer resistance to rotation while avoiding
excessive removal of the natural tooth tissue. Retention
grooves weaken the tooth and should be used only
when the first attempt at crown restoration has failed
because of crown separation (Figures 8.47-8.49).

Crown Color
 In veterinary dentistry, most crowns are made from
semiprecious metals. If the client requests a tooth-col-
 ored restoration, matching the shade of natural teeth
can best be accomplished using a shade guide.
The shade guide is held close to the tooth to be
restored and moistened to achieve an accurate match.
 The shade selected is identified by a number and letter,
which is noted on the patient's chart and on the labora-
tory instructions (Figure 8.50).

RESTORATIVE EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND TECHNIQUES

Surgical crown lengthening procedures include the
following:
1. Remove a portion of the attached gingiva and alve-
olar bone, exposing more of the natural tooth
structure.
2. Make a gingival incision with a No. 15 blade
around the affected tooth, removing 1-4 mm of the
attached gingiva exposing the underlying alveolus.
At least 2 mm of healthy attached gingiva must
remain after gingivoplasty.
 3. Remove alveolar bone from the root surfaces using
hand chisels (Oschenbein, Wedelstaedt) or a dia-
mond bur on a high-speed drill. The new alveolar
 crest should be at least 4 mm apical to the new fin-
ish line.
4. Alternatively, if insufficient attached gingiva
remains, an apical repositioned flap exposing the 
underlying alveolus and preserving the attached
 gingival collar can be performed:
a. Make an intrasulcular incision 360° around the
tooth. Vertical releasing incisions are made at the

b. Elevate a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap to
expose the supporting alveolar bone. A No. 7901
finishing diamond bur on a high-speed handpiece
or, preferably, hand chisels are used to remove
alveolar bone to the desired height.
c. Thin out edges of alveolar bone to mimic normal
anatomy. Bony ledges are removed with curettes.
d. Replace the gingiva with gingival margin located
2 mm coronal to the new bone height.
e. Place sutures to allow gingiva to lie snugly
around tooth's circumference.
Often crown lengthening procedures combine gin-
givectomy, post placement, and core buildup (Figures 
8.55-8.58).

dentition is normally arranged to create a self-cleaning
mechanism, which pushes food away from the teeth and
gingiva. If the teeth are not aligned properly, food may be
retained. Abnormally positioned teeth may impinge on
oral structures, causing the patient pain, discomfort, and
trauma, while predisposing them to periodontal disease.
Teeth that are crowded, rotated, or positioned at
abnormal angles can result in:
· Early onset and increased severity of gingivitis and
 periodontal disease.

canines might perforate the hard palate).
· Excessive wear when abnormally aligned teeth grind
against each other (attrition). Continued attrition
will lead to dentin and possible pulp exposure.
OCCLUSION
Many factors are evaluated when determining normal
occlusion in the long- and medium-muzzled dog and cat
breeds:
· The mandibular teeth should occlude lingual to the
maxillary teeth (Figure 9.1). The mandibular incisor
cusps should rest on the cingulum on the palatal side
of the maxillary incisors.

MALOCCLUSION
Abnormal tooth alignment occurs from jaw length dis-
crepancy (skeletal malocclusion), tooth malposition
(dental malocclusion), or a combination of both.
Skeletal malocclusions exist when one jaw is longer,
shorter, or angled abnormally. Examples of skeletal
malocclusions:

CHAPTER 9
Etiology of Malocclusion
Occlusion is controlled by:
Genetics
Nutrition
Trauma
·Environment
 Mechanical forces generated by an interlock of the
maxillary and mandibular teeth
To appreciate the etiology of malocclusion, an
understanding of the growth patterns of the maxilla and
mandible is essential. The maxilla and mandible are
divided into quadrants. The quadrants grow independ-

ma, or poor nutrition during one of the spurts, that part
 opmental malocclusion.
To determine whether the likelihood of a malocclu-
sion is genetic in origin, interdigitation of premolars can
 be studied. In the normal medium- and long-muzzled
dog or cat, the premolars meet in a "pinking shears"
fashion, where the tips of the mandibular premolars
point to the interproximal spaces between their
 maxillary counterparts. (Example: the medium- to long-
muzzled dog, the tips of the mandibular third premolars
 are positioned equally between the crowns of the maxil-
lary third and fourth premolars.) If the cusp tip of one
premolar points to the tip of another, or if there is an
increased space between the cusps of the maxilla and
mandible, the malocclusion probably is due to genetic
 influence. Skeletal malocclusions are generally consid-
ered genetic or traumatic in origin, and dental malocclu-

resistance. The crown moves in one direction and the
 apex in the opposite direction. It is the most common
movement in veterinary orthodontics.
·Bodily movement (translation) occurs when the
crown and apex move in the same direction.
 Rotation (torsion) moves the tooth in one direction
around its long axis.
Extrusion moves the tooth out of the alveolus.
 Intrusion moves the tooth into the alveolus.

Extrusion is the easiest to accomplish, followed by
tipping. Intrusion is the most difficult.

Alginate can be purchased as Type I (fast set) that
gels within 1 or 2 minutes after mixing with water, or
Type II (normal set) that takes 2-4 minutes to gel. The
temperature of the water and environment affect the
setting time. Heat speeds up the rate; cold slows it
 down. There is no difference in the completed impres-
sion between the two setting types of alginates.
It is imperative to accurately measure the alginate

The procedure for preparing an alginate impression
begins with anesthetizing and intubating the animal,
and cleaning the teeth. An impression tray is used to
hold the alginate material. The tray is a rigid or semi-
rigid device that is either prepurchased and reusable or
custom-fabricated to specifically match the dog or cat's

Follow these steps:
1. Before loading the tray with alginate, test it for fit
 in the patient's mouth. A proper tray fit should:

STONE MODELS
Dental models serve to permanently record occlusion.
 Dental models also help for:
· Preparation of a treatment plan
● Consultation with a collague
FIGURE 9.29. Tray placed inside of mouth, distal teeth

·  Fabricating orthodontic devices in the laboratory
· Comparison at follow-up examinations
The quality of the final orthodontic appliance can be
no better than the quality of the stone models (Figure
9.32). Any geometric defect in the impression will be
translated to the stone model and ultimately onto the
appliance, which might not fit the patient. The stone
model may be poured by staff in the veterinary office or
by the laboratory if the alginate impression can be deliv-
ered within hours after fabrication.
 Use the following setup for pouring stone models:

Stone Model Materials
Gypsum is the dihydrate form of calcium sulfate. When
the gypsum powder is mixed with water, it hardens.
Three forms of gypsum are used in pouring up stone
models (Note: Type I impression plaster is too soft and
Type V high-strength high-expansion dental stone is too
hard to use in the veterinary setting):
FIGURE 9.33. Dental stone with scoop.
· Type II model plaster, also called laboratory plaster of
 Paris, is used for pouring the primary impression, mak-
ing study models, and repairing models. Type II plaster
is weaker (low compressive and tensile strength) com-
 pared to dental stone because of the increased amount
 of space left by the evaporating water.
· Type Ill dental stone crystals are denser than those of
model plaster. Dental stone does not require as much
water to mix as the Type II plaster The resulting prod-
uct is harder stronger and more expensive than model
plaster (Burns 98.5-1690, Schein 569-3164).
Type IV high-strength dental stone requires less water
than the other forms of gypsum, resulting in a stronger
model (Tru-Stone: Miles, Inc., Schein 569-0883).

Water/Powder Ratio
the poured model.
The lower the water:powder ratio (more powder and
less water), the greater the setting strength and hardness
of the product. The optimal water:powder ratios for dif-
ferent types of dental stone and plaster differ markedly.
If less than the minimum amount of water is used mak-
ing the mix, a dry, crumbly, useless mixture results.
When the mix is too thin, more powder should be
added. If mix is too thick, more water is added.

Preparing a Base for Each Cast
Before sending the cast to the laboratory, a base is pre-
pared. Commercial rubber molds are available for mak-
ing bases, providing symmetry to the cast and reducing
the need for trimming. Alternatively, a base may be made
using boxing wax as a frame for additional plaster pour.
There are multiple methods to construct the base:

Casts should be trimmed geometrically to present an
 aesthetic appearance. The finished cast consists of two
sections: the anatomic portion, representing the teeth
 and gingival attachment, and the art portion, which is
the base or pedestal. When the bite impression 
is
matched, both arches can be articulated and placed on
the model trimmer at the same time to remove excessive
plaster or stone (Figure 9.41). Articulation can be done
 in the office or by the dental laboratory.
Occlusion Alignment Marking

Maxilla Penetration by the Primary
Mandibular Canines
Generally, any time there is a significant lesion caused
by the primary dentition, the teeth causing the lesion
should be extracted. When the maxilla is penetrated by
the mandibular primary (deciduous) canines, the
offending mandibular teeth should be extracted.
Progress re-exams are necessary to make sure that the
secondary canines do not follow the same path, necessi-

Interceptive Orthodontics
Most dogs and cats are born overshot. This occlusion
allows the neonatal animal to nurse effectively. As the
animal grows, the mandible normally goes through a
growth spurt. Occasionally the primary teeth erupt dur-
ing the accelerated growth, resulting in the mandibular
canines erupting distal and lingual to their normal posi-
tions, causing an interlock with the maxillary canines.
A dental interlock might prevent normal rostral
growth of the maxilla or mandible. Even genetically
normal dogs can occasionally develop malocclusion

allows correction of a small percentage of the inter-
erupt. Extraction does not stimulate jaw growth; it
removes the mechanical barrier to genetic control of the
growth process (Figures 9.47, 9.48).

appliances:

CHAPTER 9
Level Bite
When the maxillary and mandibular incisor, canine, or
premolar teeth meet each other edge to edge, the occlu-
sion is termed even or level (Fig 9.62). Level bite is con-
sidered normal in some breeds, although it is an expres-
sion of mandibular prognathism. A level bite produces
increased contact between the maxillary and mandibu-
lar incisors, which will lead to attrition and may lead to
 uneven wear, traumatic pulpitis, trauma to the peri-
odontal ligament, pulpal exposure, and early tooth loss.
Orthodontic correction can be accomplished using an
arch bar, attached to the maxillary canines extending
rostral to the incisors, and orthodontic buttons cement-
ed to the palatal surface of the incisors. Elastics are

Base Narrow Canines
Base narrow (lingually displaced, lingual inclined, lin-

mandibular canine teeth impinge on the maxilla. Base
narrow canines can result from:
Dental linguoversion, which occurs when the

canine, or contacts the palate. In cases of dental lin-
 guoversion, the rest of the occlusion is normal, includ-
ing the incisor relationship, premolar alignment, and
 molar occlusion. The most common etiology for lin-
mandibular canine teeth (Figures 9.69, 9.70).

 Skeletal linguoversion can occur when the mandible
is underdeveloped (mandibular brachygnathia or
micrognathia). In these cases, the mandible is too
narrow, and/or short, resulting in the mandibular
canines traumatizing palatal tissues (Figure 9.71).

maxillary canines. Mandibular canines are more
"important" than the maxillary canines for oral
function. When the maxillary canines are removed,
the mandibular canines usually fit functionally into
the void that is left. After the procedure, the dog will
still have use of the maxillary incisors, which occlude
with the mandibular canines to pick up objects.
· Cementing an acrylic, composite, or cast metal tele-
scoping inclined bite plane on the maxillary canines
to move the mandibular canine teeth labially or
facially. Orthodontic movement to treat lingually
displaced canines should start between 9 and 12
months old, before the roots are fully developed.
Over time (weeks) gradual lateral pressure usually
moves the canine(s) to functional positions. An
acrylic or composite inclined plane is useful for
minor movements. The acrylic plane is either fabri-
cated on a stone model and installed during a sec-
 ondary anesthetic event, or fabricated directly on the
patient's maxilla (preferred). (When using Jet acrylic,
an exothermic reaction takes place that may injure
the gingiva; Protemp Garant does not produce an
exothermic reaction.) Non-telescopic acrylic bite
planes restrict maxillary growth because of their
rigid nature. Food debris also lodges under the bite
plane, causing localized gingivitis. Careful tooth-
brushing, twice-daily home care, and application of

 grows in width, the appliance expands. Even if only one
mandibular canine is lingually displaced, both
 mandibular canines should be included—one incline
 plane to move the displaced canine and the other to pre-
vent shifting of the mandible (Figures 9.87-9.91). To

tooth remains stable, allowing the target tooth to move.
Healthy anchor teeth and periodontal support is critical
for successful target tooth movement. Commonly, the
maxillary fourth premolars and first molars are used
together as anchors to move rostrally deviated canines
distally.
Direct Bonding of Orthodontic

Orthodontic brackets or buttons are cemented on teeth
to provide attachment for elastics, wires, or springs.
Elastic chains are used as a source of force for many
appliances.
 Use the following setup for bracket application and
elastic placement:

Follow these steps to prepare the tooth:
1. Polish the tooth surfaces free of plaque and debris
using a rubber cup on a prophy angle and slurry of
pumice/water Fluoride paste should not be used,
because the fluoride might prevent the etching
process of the enamel.
2. Thoroughly rinse the teeth for at least 30 seconds.
3. Dry the teeth to be bracketed with oil-free com-
pressed air.
 4. Apply etching solution or gel according to the man-

 Elastics may be placed on the buttons approximate-

cases may need the addition of composite on the molars
to open the bite (bite block) sufficiently for mandibular
and maxillary canines to pass without occlusal interfer-
ence. The use of posterior bite blocks in young animals
may cause intrusion of the treated teeth. To place elas-
tics, apply light force to the elastic power chain. If the
bracket does not come off the tooth, pull the chain to
test the bond. If the bracket is dislodged, it can be reap-

EXTRACTIONS
Dental extractions are the most commonly performed
surgical procedures in general practice. The objectives 
of extractions are to:
● Remove the tooth and its root(s) with minimal trau-
 ma to the alveolar bone and surrounding soft tissues.
 Eliminate periodontal and periapical lesions.
·Prepare the alveolus for proper healing.
 Indications for extractions include the following:
● Persistent primary (deciduous) teeth interfering with
 the normal eruption of permanent teeth. When per-

lary secondary canine teeth may be diverted mesial-
ly, or the mandibular canines diverted lingually
(Figures 10.1, 10.2). When the persistent primary
teeth are extracted early, the secondary teeth usually
return to their normal location.
· Abnormal location of primary or secondary teeth,
causing trauma to opposing teeth or oral soft tissues
(Figure 10.3).
· Dental overcrowding predisposing to periodontal
disease(Figure 10.4).
● Retained or fractured root fragments (traumatic or
pathological) (Figure 10.5).
· Impacted and unerupted teeth. When left untreated,
a dentigerous cyst might form affecting adjacent
structures (Figures 10.6-10.9).

Elevators
Dental elevators are placed between the tooth's root
and alveolar bone to wedge the tooth from the alveolus.
 Basic components of an elevator are the handle, shank,
and blade or tip. Some elevators also have serrated
ridges on the cutting edge to decrease slipping during
extraction.
An elevator is used to engage the tooth through a
purchase point (a groove or hole between the tooth and
alveolus caused by periodontal disease or created with a
 bur). The elevator is grasped with a tennis racquet grip,
with one finger extending along the blade to act as a

A luxator kit is available with four instruments and
 a sharpening stone (black handle—3 mm curved blade
for general use; grey handle—3 mm straight blade for

 Luxators can be sharpened by hand by holding an
oiled sharpening stone in the one hand and the luxator
in the other. The concave surface of the tip is placed on

The process is repeated until the blade is sharpened.
Luxators also may be sharpened by using a motorized
sharpening stone (Figure 10.33).
Extraction Forceps
Extraction forceps are used to remove mobile teeth
from the alveolus. Forceps are composed of three parts:
handle, hinge, and beak. The handle enables the forceps
to be grasped to deliver adequate leverage through the
 hinge to the beak. Pressure should be applied in an api-
cal direction followed by a coronal direction to help
tear the periodontal fibers. Care must be taken not to

apply excessive pressure or torque when using extrac-
tion forceps to extract a tooth.
EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE
The veterinarian should obtain informed consent from
the pet owner before any dental extraction procedure is
performed.
 The type, amount, and direction of force applied
 during the extraction process depends upon characteris-
tics of the tooth:

tion cases.
Surgical Extraction--Flap Exposure
Surgical extraction with flap exposure is the preferred
method to remove nonmobile canines, maxillary fourth
premolars, mandibular first molars, fractured roots,
 and other teeth where nonsurgical extraction is not pos-
sible. Proper design of the flap facilitates extraction and
permits accurate closure of the gingiva without tension.
Arterial blood usually flows from distal to mesial. When
possible, either an envelope flap, which does not entail

vertical releasing incisions, or mesial (versus distal) inci-
sions are made at the tooth corner (line angle) to expose
the buccal alveolar bone. Flap incisions should extend
apical to the mucogingival line to include the elastic
alveolar mucosa.
Absorbable suture material should be used to close
exposure flaps. Monocryl (Ethicon, Inc.) is a synthetic,
monofilament suture material that combines absorption
with the strength and smoothness of nylon suture. A
swaged-on 3/8-circle, reverse-cutting needle (FS-2 or P-

Extraction of Incisor Teeth
Incisors are normally single-rooted. The first (central)
incisors have the smallest crown:root height ratio
(Figure 10.47). Third (corner) incisors have the longest
roots. Maxillary incisor roots curve palatally with
apices within a few millimeters of the nasal cavity. The
mandibular incisors have long slender roots that are rel-
atively straight with flattened sides (Figure 10.48).
Follow this technique for incisor extraction:
1. After local anesthesia infusion, incise the gingival
attachment 360° around the tooth with a #11 or
#15 scalpel blade or a sharp dental luxator inserted
into gingival sulcus.

Extraction of Maxillary Canine
Teeth
The maxillary canine root lies within millimeters of the
 nasal cavity's lateral wall. Care must be taken during
extraction not to apply force in a direction causing the
apex to move palatally resulting in penetration of the
nasal cavity (Figure 10.49).
 Use the following steps for maxillary canine tooth
extraction:
1. After infusion of local anesthesia, insert a #11 or
#15 scalpel blade into the sulcus to incise the gingi-
val attachment circumferentially around the tooth.
2. Make an incision at the line angle (corner) of the
maxillary canine and carry it distally to follow the

hand. Apply rotational torque to gently lift the
tooth away from the alveolus.

exposing the buccal alveolar bone.
 2. Using a round bur on a water-cooled high-speed
 handpiece, remove the buccal alveolar plate around 
 the exposed buccal roots. Section the crown using a
#701L long tapered transverse cross-cut fissure bur
or a water-cooled high-speed handpiece.

Molar Extraction
 In the dog, the first and second maxillary molars have
 three diverging roots arranged in a tripod configuration.
The mandibular molars have two roots except for the
most distal which usually has one root. The gingiva
overlying the molar to be extracted is flapped, and the
tooth is sectioned in a similar manner as other multi-
rooted teeth for extraction (Figures 10.66-10.69).
Feline mandibular molars have two roots.
Radiographs help visualize mesial and distal roots
before extraction.
FIGURE 10.67. Canine maxillary first molar.
Hemisection for Partial Tooth
Extraction
 Occasionally one or more roots and parts of the crown
can be saved when the diseased root has been removed,
preserving tooth function. The decision to save part of
the tooth is based on tooth importance, periodontal
support of the remaining root(s), and client consent.
Contraindications to hemisection procedures include
reduced periodontal support and/or inability to provide
an endodontic seal of the saved root(s).
 Use the following steps for hemisection technique:
1. Perform conventional endodontics, if planned,
 before hemisection; partial coronal pulpectomy
(vital pulp therapy), if planned, is performed after
the hemisection.
 2. Use a cross-cut fissure or round bur to section the
tooth, starting at the furcation entrance and contin-
uing coronally until the tooth is sectioned.
 3. Elevate and extract the diseased root(s) and associ-
ated portion of the crown.
 4. Restore the exposed pulp chamber accessresulting

CHAPTER 10
Surgical Exposure for Root
Fragment Retrieval
Teeth occasionally fracture from trauma or during den-
tal procedures. Leaving a root fragment behind, after
elevating or using extraction forceps, invites future
infection and patient discomfort.
 Fractured roots usually occur in the apical third of
the tooth. Intraoral radiographs are helpful to deter-
mine the size and shape of the root fragment. The tech
nique used for root fragment removal varies according
to the location, shape of the root, character of the sur-
rounding bone, and access. To give sufficient exposure
for removal, an envelope flap (or releasing interdental
incisions) is made over the alveolus housing the frac-
tured root (Figure 10.70):
FIGURE 10.71. Root fragments exposed.
1. When creating a fullthickness flap, keep the sharp
edge of a Molt elevator against the bone, with the
convex side of the blade held against the soft tissue.
2. Use a round bur on a high-speed handpiece to
remove part of the alveolar bone bucally, overlying
the root fragment. The root fragment will appear to
be harder than the surrounding bone. Use the bur
to outline the fragment (Figure 10.71).
 3. Use a root tip pick or elevator to remove the
exposed root fragment from the alveolus (Cislak
root forceps #4658, Peets forceps #5217) (Figure
10.72).
4. Suture the flap without tension.

failed to perforate the oral mucosa. An under-erupted
tooth occurs when the tooth erupts far enough to break
through the gingiva but most of the crown is subgingi-
val. An impacted tooth is prevented from erupting by a
physical barrier, such as thickened gingiva (Figures
10.73, 10.74), adjacent crowded teeth, or horizontal
alignment in the alveolus (Figures 10.75-10.80). An
embedded tooth is covered with bone.
The surgical removal of the mucosal flap covering an
unerupted tooth (operculectomy) is likely to be effective 
in the young animal with a tooth that has an open apex
and has eruptive potential. After 9 months of age, the
tooth is less likely to erupt even if the impediment is
removed. Extraction is recommended in the under-
erupted tooth, because a periodontal pocket will form
where debris can collect, leading to inflammation (peri-
cornonitis).
 Radiographs are necessary to evaluate areas of missing

buccal surface near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ).
FORLs can be found on any tooth, although the teeth
most commonly affected are the mandibular third pre-
molars, molars, and maxillary third and fourth premo-
lars. Some FORLs affecting the canines occur apical to
the CEJ and often are not clinically apparent. Purebred
cats, especially Siamese and Persians, appear to be more
susceptible than other cats.
The etiology of FORLs is unknown. Theories sup-
porting autoimmune mediating cellular and humoral
factors, calici virus, and metabolic imbalances relating
to calcium regulation, as well as excess vitamin D in
commercial cat foods, have been proposed.
Histologically, FORLs are filled with multinucleated
odontoclasts, which resorb dentin.
Clinically, resorptions appear as areas where the

sic gingiva. Patients affected with FORLs may show
hypersalivation, head shaking, sneezing, anorexia, oral
bleeding, or have difficulty apprehending food. The
lesion may erode into sensitive dentin, causing the cat to
show pain with jaw spasms (chatter) when touched with
a shepherd's hook explorer. Even so, most affected cats
 do not show clinical signs and many suffer in silence.
FORL CLASSES AND TREATMENT OPTIONS
There are five classes and two types of FORLs. The
resorptive lesions should be staged 1-5, and then the
roots classified as type I or I.
FORL types:
·
Type I lesions arise in the cervical area of the tooth
and extend inward and/or up and down the root.
Type I leasions are inflammatory in nature, arising
from periodontal inflammation. Radiographically,

· Class 5 FORLs lack a clinical crown (Figure 10.89),
but root fragments remain on radiographs. The deci-
sion to perform surgery to extract the remaining
root(s) is based on the patient's pain and the lesion's
appearance. If the cat feels discomfort when the
lesion is probed, the overlying gingiva is inflamed or
fistulated, or there is radiographic evidence of
pathology around the root remnant, the root(s)
should be extracted after a surgical exposure.
CROWN AMPUTATION  Crown amputation is pre-
ferred by some as an alternative to flap exposure and
full tooth extraction in the therapy of FORLs. This is a
controversial practice because it leaves the root with

up examinations are recommended, including intra-
oral radiographs when the cat is anesthetized.
Class 2 FORLs penetrate cementum into dentin
(Figure 10.86). Due to dentinal communication with
the pulp, these lesions can be painful. Treatment
options include extraction or glass ionomer restora-
tion. At one time, application of glass ionomer
restorative was the preferred treatment for class 2
 FORLs. Follow-up has shown a poor long-term suc-
cess rate, (80% failure rate after 2 years). The cur-
 rent treatment of choice is extraction.
Class 3 FORLs enter the pulp (Figure 10.87), and
the current recommended treatment is extraction.

 Use the following technique for crown amputation:

tal to the affected tooth, exposing the CEJ and alve-

 2. Using a #2 or #3 sterile round bur on a high-speed

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
FOR EXTRACTING FELINE
TEETH
Extracting feline teeth requires exacting technique. Pre-
surgical radiographs are important to evaluate root
anatomy and pathology. Teeth with dental resorptive
 lesions can be ankylosed (type I), making extraction very

difficult. Pulverizing or atomizing the root within the alve-
 olus with a water-cooled high-speed handpiece and dental
bur may result in removing excess supporting bone,
removing too little tooth, or trauma to adjacent anatomy,
and should be avoided. Removal of part or all of the facial
or bucca/labial alveolar plate around a root fragment
with a round or 701L long cross-cut taper fissure bur aids
with exposure and can help the extraction process.
 Use the following technique for extracting single
feline teeth:
1. After infusion of local anesthesia, make interdental
incisions on either side of the tooth to be extracted,
using a #11 or #15 scalpel blade (Figure 10.98).
FIGURE 10.97. Resolution of LPGS after extractions in
the patient shown in fig. 10.95.
 8. Give prednisone (l-2 mg/kg) daily and taper over a
10-day period if the cat is anorexic.
 9. Starting 2 weeks after surgery, advise and show the
client how to brush the cat's remaining teeth daily
and follow with 0.12% chorhexidine irrigation.
10. Re-evaluate the patient every other week. Within 3

DENTAL AVULSION, LUXATION,
AND SUBLUXATION
Avulsion is the complete displacement of a tooth out of
the alveolar socket, with or without a concomitant alve-
olar fracture. The most commonly affected teeth are the
canines followed by the incisors. The etiology includes
trauma from fights with other dogs or car accidents.
Time is of the essence when managing tooth luxation
and avulsion. These are true dental emergencies (Figure
FIGURE 10.118. Mandibular third and fourth premo-

lars and first molar affected by FORLs.
Successful tooth reimplantation depends on the via-
bility of the periodontal ligament. The tooth should be
handled only by the crown. Examination of the tooth
will usually reveal part of the periodontal ligament
attached. If the avulsed tooth is exposed to air for
greater than 2 hours, the prognosis is poor. If the tooth
is completely avulsed, the pet owner should be advised
 to place it in milk as a transport medium until the owner
can get the patient to the animal hospital. The owner
should not attempt to clean or debride the tooth root,
which could damage the cementum. Chilled low-fat milk
is superior to saliva or water as a temporary storage
me dium for the survival of periodontal fibroblasts.
After the tooth and patient have been examined, the

veterinarian should gently remove gross debris with
saline and, under anesthesia, replace the tooth into the
socket with digital pressure. The alveolus should not be
debrided or the clot removed before reimplantation.
After the tooth is replaced in the alveolus, it is splinted
with22G
G orthopedic wire, acrylic  (Pro-temp
Garant-ESPE), or orthodontic buttons and elastics. The
goal of fixation is to hold the tooth in place so the peri-
odontal ligament can heal. The splint should be loose
enough to allow physiologic movement. Rigid stabiliza-
tion of the tooth may result in a portion of the root
being held too tightly against the alveolar process caus-
ing ankylosis and root resorption. Short-term non-rigid
fixation for 2-3 weeks is usually sufficient for healing.

the degree of subluxation and disruption of pulpal
 nourishment. Progression of periapical pathology on
follow-up radiographs is an indication of the need for
endodontics.
 In all cases of avulsion, luxation, and subluxation,
 post-operative pain relief medication and antibiotics are
recommended.
BONE SEQUESTRA
Bone sequestra may develop when a piece of alveolar or
cancellous bone is separated from its blood supply.
FIGURE 10.130. Sequestrum surgically removed.
Clinically, the gingiva around the sequestra usually
appears denuded and inflamed. Diagnostic intraoral
radiographs reveal an island of bone partially or totally
surrounded with a radiolucent halo. Treatment involves
identifying and removing the sequestered bone. (Figures
10.129-131).
ODONTOGENIC CYST SURGERY
As a tooth develops within the jaw, the crown is sur-
rounded by a sac of epithelial tissue.
When the tooth breaks through gingiva, the epitheli-
um over the crown is lost. If the tooth never breaks

lar sequestra secondary to osteomyelitis.
through, epithelium remains around the unerupted
crown. In time, the epithelium may start to produce
fluid, causing the development of a dentigerous cyst.
A cyst is composed of three structures: a central cav-
ity (lumen), an epithelial lining, and an outer wall (cap-
sule). The cystic cavity usually contains fluid or semi-
solid material, such as cellular debris, keratin, or mucus.
There are two broad categories of odontogenic cysts
that occur in the oral cavity: developmental (dentiger-
ous) and inflammatory (periapical).
A dentigerous cyst surrounds the crown of an
impacted or unerupted, vital tooth. The cyst is usually
attached at the cementoenamel junction. The crown is
inside the cyst, the root outside. Dentigerous cysts may
 expand into adjacent bone, move adjacent teeth, and/or

CHAPTER 10
Types of Otontogenic Cysts
An eruption cyst is a dilation of the normal follicular
space surrounding the crown during eruption. An erup-
tion cyst presents as a fluctuant soft-tissue swelling of
the alveolar ridge. Treatment is generally not needed.
However, if necessary, it involves surgically excising the
cyst around the clinical crown.
 A dentigerous cyst is a dilation of the normal space
around the crown of a tooth that is unerupted or
impacted. Radiographic findings show the crown of an

the root(s) is anchored in alveolar bone. Clinically, the
enamel will be completely developed in a dentigerous
cyst. Treatment involves the thorough surgical removal
of the unerupted tooth and curettage of the cystic wall.
The defect can then be filled with an osseoconductive
material (Figures 10.132-10.134).
A periapical (radicular) cyst, also referred to as an
apical periodontal cyst, develops at the apex of an
erupted tooth whose pulp has been devitalized. The eti-
ology of a periapical cyst usually begins with trauma,
causing pulpal necrosis, apical granuloma, and cyst for-
mation. Radiographically, a defined radiolucent area
associated with the apex is noted. Treatment options
include extraction, root canal therapy, hemisection and
root canal therapy in multirooted teeth, and root canal
ent cases to permit curettage of the cystic lesion (Figures
10.135, 10.136).

Common Canine Oral Tumors
FIGURE 10.137. Marginal excision.
Epulides arise from the epithelial rest cells of Malassez
which are remnants of Herwig's epithelial root sheath
residing with the periodontal ligament. Epuli are the
most common benign oral tumors in dogs. The most
common epuli in small animal patients are classified as:
Fibromatous epuli (Figure 10.141) occur in both
dogs and cats. Ages of affected animals range 1-17
years (mean = 7.5 years). Both pedunculated and ses-
sile forms exist. Fibromatous epuli usually have a
smooth, pink surface. Marginal excision is usually
 not sufficient to treat fibromatous epuli. Removal of
the tumor, tooth, and periodontal ligament is the
treatment of choice.
 Ossifying epulis (Figure 10.142) is similar to the
fibromatous epulis, but contains an osteoid matrix.

study, tonsilar SCC was found to occur 10 times more
 commonly in dogs from urban settings compared to
rural dogs. SCC carries a better long-term prognosis
than malignant melanoma or fibrosarcoma in the dog.
SCC in the dog may be widely surgically excised or
irradiated, especially if the lesion is located rostrally.
Surgically, a maxillectomy or partial mandibulectomy
can be performed with a goal of a clean surgical margin
of 2 cm. Radiation alone delivers a median survival rate
of 15-17 months. Medically, piroxicam (orally 0.3
mg/kg/every other day), a nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory agent, can be used for palliation.

thetized, the oral mucosa is irrigated with 0.12%
chlorhexidine. Regional anesthetic nerve blocks are also
performed. Use the following steps for tumor excision:
1. Lightly trace an initial incision to provide at least a
1 cm margin for benign lesions and a 2 cm margin
for malignant lesions.

Mandibulectomy
 Mandibulectomies are classified according to the part
excised: unilateral or bilateral; rostral hemimandibulec-
tomy, central or caudal hemimandibulectomy; three-
quarter or total hemimandibulectomy. After the soft tis-
sue attachments are incised to the bone, osteotomies are
 performed, avoiding the tooth roots. The first osteoto-
my is at the mandibular symphysis followed by the pre-
planned area between the premolar teeth. A curved
mosquito hemostat can be used to locate the mandibu-
lar alveolar artery for ligation. If the artery retracts into
the mandibular canal, the canal can be packed with
bone wax to control hemorrhage. After tumor removal,
the labial mucosa is sutured to the sublingual and con-
tralateral mandibular mucosa without tension. When

Total unilateral mandibulectomy may lead to a drift
 of the remaining mandible toward the mandibulectomy
 side, although this rarely produces a functional problem
other than the mandibular canine tooth traumatizing
the palate. Crown amputation and direct pulp capping
should be considered to relieve palatal trauma, if pres-
ent.

· Intact teeth in the fracture line are not extracted if
they do not interfere with fracture reduction.
 Malpositoned teeth created by the fracture are
extracted or repositioned and splinted in functional
positions.
· Grades 3 and 4 periodontally affected teeth are
extracted or hemisected and the viable roots restored
if they are within the fracture line. Follow-up clinical
and radiographic evaluation is recommended.
 Esophagostomy tube placement may be necessary in
cases of multiple or severe jaw fractures.
 Temporary tape muzzles can be used to stabilize min-
imally displaced favorable fractures. The patient
must be monitored to ensure that the muzzle does
not interfere with normal breathing (Figures 10.159,
10.160).
· Bone plates are not commonly used in fracture repair
because of iatrogenic root trauma and the difficulty
in achieving functional occlusion.
 External fixation using pins and acrylic sidebars can
be used for fracture stabilization. External pin fixa-

JAW LUXATION/FRACTURE
Maxillary and mandibular fractures occur secondary to
 trauma or preexisting pathology (periodontal, metabol-
ic, and neoplastic). In the cat, mandibular symphyseal
separations are most common. Dogs most often fracture
the mandible between the first premolar and second
molar. Before the fracture can be fully evaluated under
deep sedation or general anesthesia, the patient must be
stabilized. Both jaws as well as the temporomandibular
joint should be thoroughly examined manually and
radiographically.
FIGURE 10.159. Support muzzle made from water-

dislocation may be responsible for a patient that acute-
ly cannot close its mouth or closes in a non-occlusal
 position. Usually, the condyloid process displaces ros-
trodorsally. The luxation may be unilateral or bilateral.
If unilateral, the mandible deviates to the side opposite
the luxated joint. Diagnosis of luxation alone or luxa-
tion with fracture can be confirmed with lateral oblique
radiographs. Treatment involves placing the animal
under general anesthesia, inserting a fulcrum (a pencil
 or tubular device) across the second molars, and closing
the jaws to insert the luxated condyle(s) into the tem-
 poromandibular joint.
 Jaw fracture repair concepts include the following:

the most critical concerns.

tion causes significant iatrogenic trauma to tooth
roots and/or the mandibular canal.
· Interdental fixation with wire, acrylic splints, and/or
orthodontic buttons and elastics is the preferred
 method to repair most small-animal jaw fractures.
· Functional occlusion is more important than cosmet-
ics.
Maxillary Fractures
Maxillary fractures occur from trauma or preexisting
pathology. Fractures resulting in minimal displacement
without a malocclusion may be treated using a tape
muzzle. Fractures resulting in instability should be sta-
bilized. General surgical and orthopedic principles
apply after physical and radiographic examination:

 provided using nonmobile teeth as anchors for splinting
material, interdental wiring, acrylic, or orthodontic but-
tons and elastics. Dental acrylic can be used to provide
support across the hard palate. Six to eight weeks
are generally recommended for healing (Figures
10.161-10.163).
Trauma may also result in palatal fracture. Physical
examination usually reveals palatal separation without
displacement. Suturing the separation leads to healing
within 2 months (Figure 10.164).
Mandibular Fractures
Pathological fractures occur most commonly in the
region of the first molars and canine teeth, caused by
marked bone loss from periodontal or neoplastic dis-
ease. Traumatic mandibular fractures commonly affect
the middle third of the mandible. Radiographic and

clinical evaluation is critical to formulate appropriate
therapeutic options.
 Fractures occurring in a rostroventral direction are
relatively stable (favorable). Caudoventral mandibular
fractures are generally unstable (unfavorable), because
of digastric muscle distraction of the fracture segments.
Interdental orthopedic wire placed on either side of the
fracture segment and stabilization using Protemp
Garant (3M ESPE) can be used to repair mandibular
body fractures.
Multiple mandibular fractures can also occur.

CHAPTER 10
Fractures of the mandibular ramus and condyloid
process are uncommon. The surrounding muscle mass
usually stabilizes the fracture segments. If unstable and
 grossly displaced, mandibular ramus fractures can be
wired. Condylar fractures will usually functionally heal
without surgery.
 Dental acrylic helps to immobilize the fractured seg-
ments. Acrylic splints are indicated for fractures rostral
to the first mandibular molar and the maxillary fourth
 premolar.
Use this technique for the intraoral splint fabrica-
tion:
1. Align the fracture segments into a functional
anatomic position. Occlusal evaluation is difficult
 in the intubated animal. To properly evaluate occlu-
sion, the animal is either intubated through a
pharangostomy or the animal can be intravenously
anesthetized and closely monitored. Suture open
lesions if possible.
2. Apply 24 gauge stainless steel orthopedic wire in a
Stout's multiple loop fashion to stabilize the frac-
ture before application of the acrylic splint (Figure
10.165).
 3. Clean, polish (using a non-fluoride polish), and
acid-etch the affected teeth in the fracture area.
4. Apply petroleum jelly to the maxillary dentition.

5. Use ProTemp Garant to fabricate the splint. Add
most of the composite resin to the lingual surface of
the mandibular teeth, so as not to interfere with
occlusion (Figure 10.166).
6. While the acrylic is still soft, close the maxilla to
full occlusion with the mandible.

 Use the following circumferential wiring technique
for stabilization of mandibular symphyseal fractures:
1. Place an 18 gauge needle behind the mandibular
 canines ventrally through the skin into the labial
mucosa (Figure 10.169).
 2. Thread 22 gauge stainless steel orthopedic wire
through the needle.
 3. Remove the needle and reinsert on the opposite
side.
4. Direct the wire toward the skin (Figure 10.170).
 5. With needle holders or wire twisters,tighten the
wire, which is cut 3-4 mm from the exit point and
bent parallel to the skin. Do not over-tighten, which
may lead to labioversion of the mandibular canine

6. The wire is removed in 3 weeks.
 Use the following figure-eight wiring technique with
caution, because this procedure may induce localized
periodontitis and cause lingual canine displacement:

ity occurs.
3. Twist the wire on the distolabial surface where the
procedure began.
 4. Apply composite material over the wire to protect
the tongue from trauma.

be unable to close its mouth. The jaw can be manually
reduced to allow normal closure of the mouth, but a
wide excursion such as a yawn may result in a locked

 Follow these steps for surgical repair:
1. Place the animal in ventral recumbency with the
head suspended by a tie around the maxilla to an
overhead support. The surgical area is disinfected
with 0.12% chlorhexidine and infiltrated with local
anesthesia containing epinephrine.
2. Make incisions to the depth of the anterior
 mandibular vestibule. In severe cases, incising the
frenula is necessary (Figure 10.174).
3. Peel away the periosteum with a Molt No. 2 and/or
No. 4 periosteal elevator (Figure 10.175).
4. Harvest a full-thickness buccal alveolar mucosal
 graft from the maxillary facial mucosa apical to the
premolars (Figure 10.176).

temperatures reach 100° C, water undergoes a phase
transformation from liquid to steam. As soon as the
pressure of the steam overcomes the strength of tissue
confinement, vaporization occurs. The classic laser
ablation crater consists of an area where tissue has been
vaporized (temperatures above 100° C), surrounded by
an area of thermal necrosis (temperatures between
60-90° C), encircled by an area of inflammation and
edema (temperatures up to 60° C).
 Heat generated in tissue seeks equilibrium and dif-
fuses from an area of high heat concentration to an area
of low heat concentration. Heat distribution in tissue
generated by laser irradiation is dependent on the wave-
length of the beam, the optical properties of tissue, the

concentration of energy deposited, and the length of
time taken to deposit that energy into tissue. Differences
in tissue content of substances-such as water, protein,
hemoglobin, and melanin—can substantially influence
the affect of a specific wavelength.
Although the influence on tissue can differ substan-
tially between different wavelengths, the influence of a
single wavelength on tissue varies, depending upon the
amount of time that is taken to deposit a specific
amount of energy into the tissue.
Lasers can be used to resect, dissect, excise, incise, or
amputate oral tissues as one would use a scalpel. One
important difference compared to scalpel surgery is that
hemostasis can be provided while the tissue is being
incised.
The cutting action depends on the type of laser and
 the tissue on which you are operating. Generally, lasers

ND:YAG LASERS (1064 NM) The Nd:YAG laser
(Figure. 10.187) penetrates deeply (several millimeters)
into oral soft tissues. In human dentistry, low-power
Nd:YAG lasers are used to provide laser-induced anal-
gesia to teeth without local anesthesia. For oral mass
ablation in human dentistry, a large volume of tissue
destruction can be accomplished using the Nd:YAG
laser. Tissue welding (apposition of incised gingival tis-
sues without sutures) is clinically performed using the
Nd:YAG laser in human dentistry using low power set-
tings (0.1-1 W). Nd:YAG laser energy penetrates tissue
 until it is absorbed by the first heavy pigment it encoun-
ters. There is litle absorption by water, moderate
absorption by hemoglobin, and high absorption by
melanin. This highly energetic beam presents potential
risk of thermal injury to pulp, periodontal ligament, and
bone when working on or near teeth. The Nd:YAG laser
may be used in continuous wave, single pulse, repeat
 pulse, and Q-switched emission modes.

with controlled bleeding and improved visualization.
 Laser excision permits histologic evaluation and estab-
lishment of clean margins by a pathologist knowledge-
able in laser-tissue interaction.
The CO2 laser can incise soft tissue in a non-contact
mode making it particularly useful for biopsy on buccal
and lingual surfaces (Figure 10.192). An excisional out-
line (Figure 10.193) can be made rapidly, using repeat-
ed single pulses (5 watts, 0.3 mm spot size) to circum-
scribe the desired target tissue. One edge of the incised
margin can be elevated with forceps and the lesion
undermined at the correct depth of dissection with the
laser. With the beam defocused, the surgical wound is

3 mm. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode lasers can also be
used for oral biopsies.
Gingival Troughing for Crown
Preparation
When preparing a tooth for crown restoration, a trough
or space between the free gingiva and crown is created
 to allow a marginal line for impression material. If pre-
pared with a scalpel blade, the incised gingiva bleeds,
generating additional surgical time for hemostasis and
potential impression inaccuracy.
The carbon dioxide or diode laser tip held in a near
parallel position to the tooth can form a trough. Care
should be taken to avoid having the beam contact
enamel or dentin. Argon lasers are not recommended
for troughing because of the wavelength's strong
absorption by blood (Figures 10.195-10.198).

endodontic therapy and acrylic resin restoration.
Operculectomy
Operculectomy can be performed with a laser for exci-
sion of thick fibrous gingival tissue over an impacted
tooth. Ten watts of CO2 laser energy with 0.3 mm spot 
size can be used to incise a mucosal flap and expose the
underlying crown (Figures 10.199-10.201).
The Nd:YAG laser can also be used at 5-10 watts in
 contact mode for operculectomy surgery.
Frenectomy
Lasers can be used to perform maxillary and lingual
frenectomies with little or no bleeding, and often with-

contact mode vaporizes the frenulum quickly. Either
continuous wave mode at 3-5 watts of power with a 0.3
mm spot size for incision, or a pulsed mode at 20 watts
and a 1.4 mm spot for ablation can be used. With the
frenulum stretched taut, a short vertical incision is made
through the mucosa at the mid-portion of the frenulum.
Horizontal releasing incisions are then developed
through the mucosa on both sides, extending to the
periosteum.
Tongue Lesions
Solitary and multiple tongue lesions (Figure 10.202) can
be excised using the CO2 laser (Figure 10.203). Laser
 parameters of 10 watts with a spot/tip size of 0.4 mm is
commonly used. Penetration into the muscularis layer
should be avoided. Sutures are generally placed if the
 post-surgical defect is greater than 3 mm.

Oral Neoplasia
 Laser use in oral cancer surgery provides advantages of
hemostasis, decreased post-operative edema, and dimin-
ished infection. Additionally, because of the laser's abil-
ity to seal small blood vessels and lymphatics, there is a
reduced likelihood of inducing tumor microemboli dur-
ing the procedure.
The CO2, diode, and Nd:YAG lasers can be used for

Gingival Surgery
Gingivoplasty can be performed in cases of minimally
lingually displaced mandibular canine teeth to remove
gingival areas of palatal impingement. For the gingivo-
plasty, 8-10 watts of superpulsed CO2 laser energy in a
defocused mode is used to vaporize sequential layers of
tissue until the mandibular canine tooth is no longer
impinging on the gingiva (Figures 10.206-10.208).

For the treatment of gingival hyperplasia, the CO2
laser can be set at 4-8 watts in continuous mode and
 applied over the incised area after blade gingivectomy to
shape the gingiva and aid hemostasis (Figures
10.210-10.212).
Removal of traumatic sublingual granulation tissue
(gum chewers lesions) can also be accomplished using
the CO2 laser. Following excision, laser power is
decreased to 4 watts with a defocused beam to seal
small blood vessels. Sutures are not usually needed
(Figure 10.213).

Feline  lymphocytic  plasmacytic  gingivostomatitis
(LPGS) is a multifactorial disease. The CO2 laser can be

 Post-operatively, an appropriate oral antibiotic and
pain relief medication is given for 2 weeks. Monthly
 rechecks are advised. Depending on response, repeat laser
 treatments are performed to remove residual inflamma-
tion 4-6 weeks apart. Nonresponsive cases should have
additional evaluation, dental radiographs, and extrac-
 tions. Approximately 20% of the stomatitis cases remain 
resistant to therapy (Figures 10.214-10.216).

the affected areas.
 Pre-operative blood testing (including screens for
FIV and Felv), oral examination with charting, and
intraoral dental radiographs are evaluated. Initial ther-
apy consists of extraction of those teeth that have feline
odontoclastic resorptive lesions and greater than 25%
 support loss. The CO2 laser can be used at 2-6 watts of
 power, with a 0.8-1.4 mm tip in continuous wave mode
to vaporize inflamed tissue. The beam is defocused to
"paint" (raster) the entire inflamed tissue area.
Rastering is repeated until there is minimal bleeding
after the char is wiped away. There may be some bene-
fit in using a scanner or a pattern generator for beam
delivery. The scanner improves tissue vaporization over
a large area and reduces heat buildup in the tissue dur-
ing ablation. Superpulse mode is not recommended,
because the decreased lateral thermal damage decreases
the fibrous tissue response.

Areas of Future Laser Applications
As veterinarians become more comfortable with the use
of lasers in the oral cavity, similar applications in
a da on pa aa m a s 
nary patients. One use under investigation is etching
enamel and dentin for bonding. Preliminary studies
show a better etch may be obtained with the laser than
with conventional phosphoric acid, leading to improved
marginal sealing and decreased microleakage of com-
 posite resin restorations.
Human dentists use lasers to remove hard dentin and
enamel in cavity preparation and sulcular debridement

sues. Radiosurgical incisions produce minimal tissue
damage due to the low level of lateral heat produced.
Lateral heat production is related to:
· Time: Less lateral heat is generated with fast passage
of the electrode through tissue.
· Intensity: High intensity carbonizes tissue; insuffi-
cient intensity causes sticking of the electrode to tis-
sue.
· Current chosen: Four radiosurgical waveforms are
commonly available. Generally, the more pulsatile
the waveform (as seen on an oscilloscope), the more
lateral heat is generated:
The fully filtered current produces 90% cutting
and 10% coagulation. The fully filtered current is

 The fully rectified current produces 50% cutting

can be used for gingivectomy, gingivoplasty, and
troughing procedures for crown impressions. The
fully rectified current should not be used when
operating near bone.
The partially rectified current produces 90%
coagulation and 10% cutting with increased lat-
eral heat and tissue shrinkage. Partially rectified
currents should not be used near bone.
Hemostasis can be accomplished using a unipole

 The fulgurating current employs a half-wave cur-

Educating
 Your Client
Most owners care deeply for their pets and want exist-
ing problems treated. For the client to appreciate the
degree of disease present, he or she first has to be able
to see what the veterinarian considers abnormal.
Unfortunately, teeth are hidden behind the lips. Instant
mouth."
Dental photography is also an education tool.
Images can present the animal's problem and allow the
veterinarian to speak about therapy using the pet's
pathology to refer to, rather than struggling with a
poorly illuminated oral cavity. Gingivitis and periodon-
tal disease show vividly with instant and digital pho-
tography. To further educate the dental client, the vet-
erinarian can compare the pet's condition with a text-
 book representation of disease. This helps confirm that
the pet's lesion is a real problem that needs care.
GENERAL PHOTOGRAPHIC
TIPS
The final product should be evaluated through the
viewfinder or digital screen before the picture is taken.
 The goal is to get a clear picture of the pathology:
 Extraneous items (fingers, tongue, endotracheal
tube, other teeth) which draw the viewer's attention
away from the pathology should not be present in
the finished image (Figure 11.1).
· The photographed area should be clean of blood and
hair.
 The highest magnification available should be chosen
 to see the lesion and adjacent normal tissue clearly.
· With single lens reflex (SLR) cameras, fine focus can

CHAPTER 11
INTRAORAL INSTANT
PHOTOGRAPHY
Intraoral instant cameras are available through the
 Polaroid Company. They are simple to use, allowing
anyone in the office to get an acceptable photo with dif-
ferent levels of magnification. There are two popular
models, which focus using infrared beams: the Polaroid
Macro 5 SLR (Schein 987-2593) (Figure 11.2) has five
 built-in enlargement options and a date stamp, and the
 Polaroid Macro 3 SLR has three built-in enlargement
options.
A slide duplicator (Polaroid) (Figure 11.3) can be
 used to make enlargements of dental radiographs to
share with clients or referring veterinarians. To convert
the dental film to a photograph, the developed radi-
ograph is placed in a slide holder and inserted into the
slide duplicator. A 3X enlargement is developed within 
one minute.
 Providing the client with before and after photo-
graphs of pathology when therapy is completed gives
readily comprehensible and visually impacting docu-
 mentation of the case and your skills. One picture set

can be inserted in the medical record and the other
given to the client to show those at home. A third set of
interesting dental cases can be placed in a Smile Book to
show new clients.
Unfortunately, sometimes needed dental care is not
performed because the owners do not realize the impor-
tance or urgency. If the client chooses to decline the rec-
ommended therapy in the exam room, the instant pho-
tograph can be given to them to share with others at
home, or to post on the refrigerator or bathroom mir-
ror until they are ready to accept treatment.
 The instant image also allows the veterinarian to
show the dental laboratory the condition of the teeth
that need repair.
Single Lens Reflex (SLR) Cameras
Single lens reflex (SLR) cameras, once the mainstay of
client photographic education, to some extent have
been replaced by instant (Polaroid) and digital photog-
raphy. The main disadvantage of slide or print photog-
raphy is time of delivery of the final picture compared
to other formats. Kodak produces a special dental 35

give true representation of the shades of teeth and gin-

is convenient, limitations of the image size are
imposed by the 1.44 MB floppy disk.
 The resolution of digital cameras has improved to
mimic print/slide cameras. Many digital cameras
offer a selection of resolution settings. A high resolu-
tion increases the quality of the image and markedly
increases the picture size (which can be adjusted)
(Figure 11.10).
● Kodak DX 4900 has 4.0 megapixel image resolution
and uses EasyShare Camera Doc II, a PC interface
 device that also recharges the digital camera batter-
ies. The dock eliminates USB cables, media cards, or
external media card readers (Figure 11.11).
Image format controls how the picture is stored.
 Digital cameras store images in many formats. The

 detachable disk or memory
stick to save the image.
 PC-cards are small matchbox-sized disks that save
multiple images. The PC-cards are placed in a cradle
attached to the computer for access. The Smart
 Media format used by Olympus and Toshiba cam-
eras allows the user to insert the card into an adapter
 that fits into the floppy drive.
