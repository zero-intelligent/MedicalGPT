Foreword
This newmanual is a verywelcome addition to the nowworld
renowned scrics of BSAVA publications. It complements the existing
Arthrology and Diagnostic Imaging manuals and will be an invaluable
help to practitioners at all stagcs of their careers.The full use of
colour in both the line drawings and photographs adds to theclarity of
the text.Practical tips and warnings arc printed in coloured boxcs to
assist theveterinary surgeon checking on a clinical case.
The manual describes the background to fracture repair, radio-
graphic assessment and the management of specific fractures.The
operative techniques are described in a novel and most easily assimi-
lated form,withcvery detaillisted,ineluding the instrumentsrequired
and the need for assistance during the operation.
The editors are to be congratulated on their choice of contributing
authors,whohavea truly international standing and abackground of
academic and orthopaedic referral practicc.This has resultcd in a
workwhich,Iam sure,will rank as one of themain components of the
practicebookshelf foryears tocome.

Preface
Ourmajorobjective in producing thismanual was tocreate an
orthopaedictext dedicated tothepracticalmanagementoffracturesin
thedogandcat.Wheresurgical treatment isindicated,we didnot
wish tomerelyillustrate anidealisedrepair,but also toguide the
and practical tips alreadyknown to more experienced surgeons.
Parts1and2provideacomprchensivebackground tofracture
managermentcoveringbasicsciencesand theprinciplestobeapplied
laterinthebook,aswellasasobcringreviewof thehistoryof fracture
treatment.Part 3describes themanagement of specificfractures by
region.In the first part of each chapter,types offracture are described
and themost appropriate treatmentisindicated.Thereaderis then
referred to therelevantOperativeTechnique at theend of thechapter.
Thesemay describea particulartechnique as applied tothat region,
e.g.bone plating,ormay describe themanagement of specific

in the first two parts of themanual.The surgical approaches illustrated
are notcomprehensive andit isintcnded that the Operative
Techniquesareread and used inconjunctionwith standard textson

Our thanks are due toall thecontributingauthorswhohave
produced comprehensive texts andwe are grateful for their patience
throughout themassive taskofreformatting textinto the current
layout whichwehopewill add to the ease of use of the manual.
We alsowishto express our appreciation toFusionDesignwhohave
played amajorrolein defining thelayout,toVickiMartinBScBVSc
whohasproducedfigures ofoutstanding clarity,and toMarion
Jowett,PublishingManagerforBSAVA,whohascoordinated it all.
ThankyoutoSimonPetersen-Joneswhoinitiallyproposed theidea of
a fracture manual and guided the development phase.
Finally,althoughwehave endeavouredtoproduce avery
practically orientated support text,wedo encourage clinicians to
recognizeparticularlychallengingfractures and toseek advicefrom
more experienced colleagues or torefer the case.We trust you will
find this book both interesting to rcad and an invaluable companion in

The results achieved were better than previously,duc

subject whichreflects a worldwideacceptance of these
techniques. Sophisticated systems may be purchased

Appreciating theseinternalforces and deformations is
important inunderstanding the limits of bone as a

The properties of cancellous bone are determined by
its densiry and by its architecture.It also displays
anisotropy. There are few conditions in animals in
which the mechanics ofcancellous bone need to be
considered.The primary concern is its ability to hold

Definition
Interdental wiring
Fixation technique used in management of mandibular and maxilary fractures.
Fragment alignment and stabilityare achievedby the placement of one or more wire
loopsthat span thefracturedregion and are anchored around intact teeth on either side
of the fracture.
Interdental splint
Uses the same principle as interdental wiring except that the wire is augmcnted with
a dental acrylic splint which also spans the fracturedregion.In some circumstances
the wire isomitted and the dental acrylic splint isbonded directly to tooth enamel.
Intraoral splint
Dental acrylic appliance placed against the hard palate and eitherwired or bonded to
the teeth of themaxilla in order to maintain alignment and support offracture
fragments.
Interarcade wiring
Intraoral placement of wirebetween the mandible andmaxilla to produce partial oral
closure.Fracture fragmcnt alignmcnt is naintained as aresult of interdigitation of
teeth of the upper and lower dental arches.

intervertebral dise spaces with a hypodermic needle. Converge screws in vertebral body to

Reduction andFixation
Towel clamps or artery forceps attached to the dorsal spinous processes cranial and caudal to the fracture/
luxation may be distracted with a Gelpirctractor.Alternatively,an assistant may apply traction and counter
traction.The tip of a small Hohmann retractor can be placed under the lamina of the ventrally displaced
(usually caudal) vcrtcbra and levered on the lamina of the dorsal (usually cranial) vertebra to aid final
reduction.Reduction may often be maintained with screws or K-wires,placed across intact articular
proccsscs.Manual reduction by the assistant surgeon is occasionally necessary.Threaded pins(pre-drilled)
orscrews are placed bilaterallyin thevertebral bodies where the transverseprocesses originate.A minimum
oftwopins orscrews,andpreferablythree,should beplaced bothcranialandcaudal tothefractureorluxation.
13.18 a-e).
PRACTICAL TIP
Placement of pins/serews in L7 vertebral body leaving sufficient implant available for
incorporation in cement is technically difficult because of the proximity of the ilial wings.Placing
serews in the ilial wings is an alternative (Figure 13.18).
WARNING
Protect vital hindlimb spinal nerves.Excessive cement may make wound closure difficult.
Ensure pins do not unduly penetrate the abdominal (orthoracic) cavity,since they may result
in vascular injury (immediate or delayed) i.e.measure,rather than eye-ball, their depth.

AdditionalComments
When using bone cement techniques the surgeon has a choice of vertebral body pins or screws.The
advantagesofscrewscomparedwithnon-threadedpins arethat theyhavegreaterpull-outresistance,areless
likely tomigrate,are interchangeable if length isinappropriate,and donot need to bebent orcut.However,
screws are debatably more difficult to insert than pins.The author's preference is to use positive profile
threaded pins(negative profile have atendency tobreak),whichcombine the advantages of screws andnon-
threaded pins.Although accuratc inscrtion is aided by their self-tapping nature it isbeneficial topre-drill a
pilot holewhose diameter approximates to but doesnotexceed theinner diameter of the pin.Thisimproves
pin loosening (Clary and Roe 1996).Pre-drilling also enables the depth of the vertebral body to be measured
accuratcly prior to pin insertion.

Sacral fracturesand caudal vertebral fractures and luxations
Sacralfractures
Sacral fractures commonly have concomitant pelvic injuries;for example,ilial fracture or sacroiliac
separation(Anderson and Coughlan,1997).Pain is often a feature and neurological deficits can be significant
(e.g.urinary and faecal incontinence),especially when fractures traverse thesacral canal orsacral foraminae.
Fractureslateraltothesacralforaminac andthosc involvingthe spinous processes are oflessclinicalsignificance
(Kuntz et al.,1995).A classification for sacral fractures has recently been proposed (Figure 13.23).

Lateral condylarfractures
Lateral condylar fracturcs arc stabilized with a
transcondylar lag screw and anti-rotational K-wire
(Operative Technique 15.8).The K-wirc is also used
for initial fixation.
Lateral condylar fractures carry a good prognosis
provided they are correctlyreduced and stabilized.
Some77%go on to regainfull limb function and the
average recovery time is4weeks (range 2-8weeks).

Surgical Approach
(See also Operative Technique 14.2.)
Tenotomy of the tendon of insertion of theinfraspinatusmuscleisnecessary to givegood exposure of the
shoulderandalsoto allowthehumeral shaft tobepulled distally usingKernforceps positionedasinFigure
15.13) during exposure of the fracture surfaces.The joint capsule or its remains are reflected to allow
inspection of the articularsurfaces.Thefracturedhumeral head usuallyloses allsoft tissuc attachments and
is found impacted in the soft tissues caudal to the shoulder.
ReductionandFixation
Atthisstagetheproximalhumeralshaftisrotatedoutoftheincision;thehumeralheadispickedupandplaced
in its correct position on themetaphysis.It can then beheld in place by oneof twomethods.In thefirst,K-
wires aredrivendownfrom thearticular surface throughtheheadintothemetaphysis;thewires arecut flush

fashionfromthecranial,craniolateral and craniomedial aspectofthemetaphysisupinto thehumeral head
(Figure 15.15a).To allow maximum purchase in the head,each K-wire is advanced until its point just
penetrates the articular surface;thewire isthen retracted until the tiplies just belowthe surface.
The distal ends of the wires are cut close to the
surface of themetaphysis.If there is fracture of the
lesser tuberosity and the fragment is unstable,K-
wire fixation can be carried out at this stage.The
humeral head is placed backinto the glenoid.The

External fixation:humerus
Pre-operativeConsiderations
The humerusissurrounded bymuscleand,with theexception of twosmall
areas on the proximal and distalends of the bone (Figure 15.21),there are no
safe corridors for the introduction of the pins (Marti and Miller,1994).
Transfixion of large muscle masses by pins results in pain and stiffness due
tomuscle fibrosis.In addition,pin tract infections aremore likely to occur.
Theseproblemscan beminimizedby using a standard craniolateralapproach
to thefracture.Once thefractureisaligned the pinscanbeintroducedeither

In comminuted fracturesof the diaphysis,theintact shaft oneithersideof thecomminutedareaisgrasped

(see Chapter10).Aunilateralexternalfixatoris applied to the craniolateral surface of thebonegenerally
with threepinsinthe proximal fragment and twoin thedistalfragment.The distalpinisplacedfirst.If the
distal segment isveryshort then thepin is placed in the transcondylar position;thispin can be safely
introduced through a stabincision over the condyle（Figure 15.22a).If the distalsegment is long enough,
thepin canbeplaced justproximal to the supratrochlearforamenbut thisshould be done as an open
approach so as to identify the radial nerve (Figure15.16b).Themost proximal pin is placed just distal to
the greater tuberosity (stabincision).Five clamps are placed on a connecting bar.The proximal and distal
clampsare attached tothepins alreadyin place(Figure15.22b).Fracturealignmentisre-checkedand,once

WARNING
The radial nerve emerges between the lateral head of the triceps and the brachialis
muscle just proximal to the incision,butprovided dissection is limited to the soft tissues
over the lateral condyle and its supracondylar ridge there should belittle risk ofnerve
damage during exposure.
Using a periostealelevator,anyremainingmuscleattachments arecleared from the adjacentsurfacesof the
fractured supracondylarridge.Thecondyleis thenrotated laterally toallowremovalofhaematomaand
gramulation tissuefrom theintercondylarfracturesite.
ReductionandFixation
The simplestmethodof reducing the condylcisto exert pressure onthecondylewithfinger and thumb and
then maintain reductionwith pointed reduction forceps (Figure 15.26a).The lateral condyle does have a
tcndency torotatecaudally and applicationofAllistissueforceps across thefractured supracondylar
ridge helps to prevent this (Figure 15.26b).Alternatively,a K-wire can be used (Figure 15.26c,d).

Fractures of the radius and ulna constitutc 8.5% to
17.3%of all fractures seen in thedog and cat (Sumner-

OPERATIVE TECHNIOUE 16.1(CONTINUED)
Fractures through the semi-lunar notch and avulsion fractures of the olecranon
PRACTICAL TIPS
It is easiest to power-drive small diameter arthrodesis or K-wires using an air or electric drill.
Larger Steinmann pins may be placed by hand, using a Jacobs chuck.
When placing larger diameter pins by hand it is often easier, and more precise,to pre-drill a pilot
hole using a smaller diarmeter drill bit.
A hole is then drilled transversely throughthe ulna1 to 2cmdistal to thefracture.Alengthof stainlesssteel
wireis passed through the hole and its freeends are crossed.Similarly,a length of wire is passed around the
caudal aspect of the olecranon cranial to the pins.The ends of the two wires are then twisted together
altcrnately until the tensionband is tight.
WARNING
The proximal loop of the tension-band wire must pass as close as possible to the bone to avoid
pressure necrosis at the triceps tendon insertion.
Finally,the pins arebent in acaudal direction close to the end of the olecranon and are cutleaving a small
hook.Eachpinis twisted180°cranially so that the bent end of thecranial pin lies overthe tension-band wire
(Figure 16.11d).
The diaimeter of thepins isbased on the sizeof the animal and the ability to place two pins parallel to cach
othcr in the ulna.In small dogs and cats,a single pin placed within theintramedullary canalanda wiretension-
bandisoftensufficient.However,if thistechniqueisused,thefractureshouldbeobliqueand interlocking
topreventrotational instability,and the pin should extend thelengthof theproximal third of the ulnar
diaphysis.
Stainless steel wire of 0.8 mm diameter is sufficicnt in cats and toy dogs; larger dogs require wire of
1-1.2 mm diameter.
WARNING
Note the lateral curvature and narrow intramedullary canal of the proximal ulna. Care must be
taken to avoid exiting through theside of the ulna or entering the elbow jointwhen drivingpins
in this area.
Care must be taken to identify and protect thebranch of the ulnarnerve that courses near the
medial humero-ulnar articulation.
Wound Closure
Routine.Periosteum and deepfascia can be closed as one layer.
Post-operative Care
A light drcssingis appliedforafew days and passiveelbowflexion/extensionexercises should be encouraged
post-operatively.Exerciscshouldbecontrolledfor4to6weeks.Onoccasionsthc pinsmayloosen,ortheir
protruding endsmay cause soft tissueirritation;thiswouldnecessitateremoval once fracture healing is
complete.
AlternativeTechnique
In medium-sized to largebreeds of dogs,place the fragnents under compression using a lagged cortical or
cancellous screw in combination with a pin and tension-band wire (seeFigure 15.33).

Reduction andFixation
Fracture reductionmaybeaccomplishedbybending thelimb caudally at thefracture site,togglingthebone
ends against eachotherand thenstraightening the limb.Wherethereis significant overridingof thefracture
aHohmannnretractormaybeused tolever thedistalfragment into alignment.Sometimes theradius cannot
be reducedwithout first reducing theulna.In these cases,it is useful to cut back the ulnarfragment.
PRACTICAL TIP
Beware of soft tissue interposition at the ulnar
fracture site preventing accurate radial fracture
alignment.
Whena plate isapplied to the cranial surface of theradius
（seeFigure16.20),it should firstbe prestressed toallowfor
thenaturalcranial curvature oftheradius andtoensure
compression at the transcortex (see Chapter9).It is best to
applytheplatetothedistalradialfragmentfirstsothatitmay
be used as a lever to aid in reduction. Once the fracture is
reduced,boncholding forceps are usedtofixtheplate tothe
proximalfraginent prior toscrew placement.Obliquefrac-
tures are stabilizedwithpointedreduction forceps,and
where possible a lag screw,or alternatively a K-wire,is
placed across thefracture.Thiswill prevent thefragments
from slipping past each other during plate application.
PRACTICAL TIP

Extcrnal fixation is usually applied to the

the mediolateral plane, making pin inser-

For trans-ilial pin technique: appropriate size pin; chuck; large pin cutters.
For both tcchniqucs: Kern bone-holding forceps; hand-held or self-retaining retractors (e.g. Gelpi).
Surgical Approach
A dorsal midline approach is used to expose sacroiliac luxation/fractures.The dorsal back muscles are
reflected laterally off the spinous processes of L6,L7 and the sacrum.The lateral surface of the sacrum is
exposed and the dorsal aspect of the displaced ilium is identificd.
Alternatively,thelateral sacrum can be approachedvia anincision over the iliac spine,with subsequent
dissection down between the epaxial muscles and the medial aspcct of theilium (Piermattei,1993).The
midline approachis the authorspreference forboth of the repair techniques described helow,but either
approach is equally satisfactory.The midline approach facilitates trans-ilial pinning.

be placed in the centre of the exposed sacral

Fixation
Althoughnon-platingsurgicaltechniqueshavebeendescribedforrepairofacetabularfracturesnoneof them
has proved tobe aseffective as bone plates or has provided the clinical results that bone plates have.Two
different sizesof C-shaped acetabular platesfrom theAO/AsIFgroup(SynthesLtd) are effectivein the
treatment of simplc acctabularfractures.Miniaturefragmentplatesand standardDynamic Compression
Plates(Synthes,Ltd)have been used to stabilize acetabular fractures.Some surgeons prefer to use the
reconstruction platefor acctabularfractures because it canbebentinseveral different planes.
PRACTICAL TIP
The bone fragmentswill shift in position as the
screws are tightened if the plate is not
perfectly contoured to the dorsal surface of
the acetabulum.
The C-shaped acetabularplates areeasy tocontour to the
acetabulum’s dorsal bone surface because of their shape.
Mini plates are easy to bend because they are thin.

Commonmistakesinplate applicationinclude:notexposing thetibia proximally enoughwhere it is easy to
believe theexposuremust be close to thestiflewhen thereis still one-third of the tibia further proximal
(especially in obese patients);andnot extending the plate distally cnough for fear of compromisingthe
tarsocrural joint.Proximal exposure is assisted by useof the groin sling described above and having an
assistant to apply traction to the limb.If the bone stock is poor proximally thenT-or L-platesmay enable
adequate screwgrouping’and thus implant purchase,although these tend tobeavailableinonlylimited
lengths and are oftcninadequate in comminuted fractures.As long as the plate doesnot extendbeyond the

Closure
Closure is achieved by apposition of the subcutaneous and/or subcuticular fascia and then the skin.
Post-operative Care
Inmost cases it is preferable to apply a Robert Jonesbandagefor3 to7 days.
Exerciserestriction should be implemented until radiographic healingof the
fracture is apparent-usually 4 to8weeks,depending on thenature of the
fracture and age of the patient.Theneedtoremove implants is a controversial
issue.Generally,he author prefers toleave theimplantsin situ unless they
causeproblems.Themostcommonreasonsforremoving the plate are caused
bylack of soft tissue coverinthisregion.Thesubcuticularimplantmay cause

Positioning
Dorsolateral recumbency with the affected limb down,to allow access to the medial aspect (Operating

twisters.External fixation equipment(see OperativeTechnique 19.5)if type I fixator is used as auxilliary
fixation (see Figure 19.15a).
Surgical Approach
The fracture site is exposed using a limited craniomedial approach (Operative Technique 19.3).
Reduction andFixation
In thecase ofreconstructablecomminuted fractures thefragments arereduced and compressedintoposition
using cerclagewires untila two-piecefracture isachieved.When applyingtheseitmust be ensured that the
fibulaisnotincluded,sincethiswillmakeitimpossibletoachieve adequate tensioninthewire.Theproximal
part of thetibial diaphysisiswedge-shaped and toprevent slipping of thewire itmaybenecessary tocreate
a notch in the surface of the bone or apply the wire in a hemicerclage fashion (Chaptcr 9). If the wirc is
tightened by twisting the two ends around one another then it is usually necessary to bend the ends over, as
there is inadcquate soft tissuc covcrtoconsidcrthec optionof lcaving them standing atright angles tothe bone
surface.It is inappropriate to place the pinfirst and then try toreconstruct thefraginents,as sonebone length
will have bccnlost and accurate anatomical alignmcnt will not be possible.Thc rcsulting fracture gaps will
create extra strain on thewires leading to theirloosening.
PRACTICALTIP
Although,with care,retrograde pinning is possible, it is generally considered that normograde
pinning is most appropriate for tibial fractures.
The pin isintroduced alongside the medial border of the straightpatellar ligament through akey-hole
incision with the stifle held flexed.It enters the bone at the base of the tibial crest,cranial to thc
intermeniscal ligament (Figure 19.13).Although a Jacobs chuck can be used,a slow-speed power drill
affordsbettercontrolof placement andis lesslikelytobeassociatedwiththe pin slippingoff thc proximal
tibia.To prevent the pin slipping off the tibial plateau during insertion,a pilot hole can bemade with a
smallerdiamcterpin(a drillbit can beusedbutthistcnds towrapupthe soft tissucs,and the limited access
prevents satisfactory use of tissue guards).Whenever possible the notch in a pre-cut pin is protected by
being kcpt within the chuck in order to prcvent prcmature brcakage.The pin is driven into the distal
metaphysis (Figure 19.13).As the pin approaches the distal metaphysis,it is perhaps better to abandon a
powcr drill (if used)in favour of a Jacobs chuck.The chuck providesbetter control,making it less likely
that the hock joint will be cntcred.

Centraltarsal bonefractures
Central tarsal bonc fracture in the non-athletic dog is
rare and generally involves avulsion fracture of the
plantar process.Due to the small size of the fragment,
the fracture should be managed by a mediolateral

Fractures of the numbered tarsal bones are almost
invariably associatedwithcentraltarsal bonefracture
in the racing Greyhound. Compression fracture of
T4 is most commonly obscrvcd.Placcmcnt of
the mediolateral screw during central tarsal bone

additional support is required,a second medio-

Dorsal slabfractures of T3 can occur in isolation
(Dce,1988).Dorsoplantar lag scrcw fixation is thc
treatment of choice.The post-operative care is as for

SURGERY
Routine orthopaedic surgical asepsisis practised but
the proximity of the nails andpads implies likely
contamination of the surgical site.Nails should be
scrubbed andshould beisolatedfromthesurgicalsite
ifpossible.The use of stcrile plastic foot bags or
adhesive drapes should therefore be considered.The
routine use ofperioperative antibiosis is advisedfor
surgery of the foot.

Fractures of the patella can be classified as either
displaced orundisplaced and as transverse,longitudi-
nal,polar or comminuted (Figure 22.1).

Non-weight-bearing lameness will be noted inmany
animals.Othersmaybesurprisinglysound,especially

thatthe orthopacdic wire is applied correctly and is of sufficient gauge (0.5 mm or0.8 mm, catand small dog;
1.0 mm,mediun-sized dog:1.25 mm, large dog).
PRACTICAL TIPS
Orthopaedic monofilament wire is used, not suture material.
Use a large hypodermic needle as a wire passer to allow correct positioning of the horizontal arms
 of the tension-band.
The horizontal arms of thewireshould passimmediatelycaudal totheK-wire and thepatellar attachments

AlternativeTechnique
Successful treatment of transverse fractures by partial patellectomy isreported(Carb,1975)butresults are
often poorer than succcssful reconstruction andfixation.Conservativemanagement of transverse patellar
fractures has been reported to have failed in the dog(Alvarenga,1973),but tohave succeeded in the cat
(Arnbjerg and Bindseil,1994).
WARNING
Until a large series of canine patellarfractures treated by conservativemanagement isreported
it is probably better to treat them surgically.

If fragment size and type or surgical equip-

elitis usually requires a combination of surgery and a
prolonged course of antibiotics.There are several
basic principlesthat apply to the treatment of the
disease:
Surgical debridement to remove all dead and
necrotic soft tissue and bone
Allow drainage and obliterate dead space
Stabilize thefracture site if necessary
Prolonged course of antibiotics based on the
results of culture and sensitivity.
These basic guidelincs should be tailored to each
individual case.Essentially, the same principles are
applied to themanagement of acutc and chronic ostco-
myelitis.However,chronic osteomyelitis is usually
characterized by the presence of avascular cortical
bone that requires removal forresolution of the infec.
tion and isusually associated with delayed fracture
healing or non-union.

Excessive gap at the fracture site
Thismaybe causedby several different factors.Thebone endsmaybe distracted bylack of immobilization or
by the fixation tcchnique used.There may be interposition of soft tissue which impedes callus formation,

General factors
Most of these do not themselves causenon-union butmay predispose toit.Sufficient amounts of dictary calcium
and phosphorus are important for corrcct mineralization of the callus. Metabolic disorders (e.g. liver failure,
diabetes,hyperadrenocorticalism) may delay healing.Dogs receiving high doses of corticosteroids or cytotoxic
drugs for other problemsmay be atrisk of anon-union.Hyperparathyroidism (nutritional orrenal) may also

Transverse
This is usedprimarilyforrotational deforimities.Conpression platingof theflat osteotomy surfaces provides
the best stability.K-wires can be temporarilyplaced in the boneprior tomaking theosteotomy and used as
markers togauge the amount of de-rotation.
Cuneiform-closed wedge
This type of osteotomy ismainlyused foraxial deformities.Awedge ofboneisremoved from the point of
maximal deformity.Compressionof the osteotomy should result inarapid healing.Thistechniqueissimple and
gives good stability.Its main disadvantage is in causing bone shortening.
Cuneiform -open wedge
A transverse osteotoinyis carried out and the bone straightened by creating an open wedge on the concave

deformity.The disadvantages include the rcquircmcnt fora bone graft, longerhealing time due to the defect and

but is then halved.The wedge is removed with its base on the convex surfacc of thebone and is thenrevcrscd
and insertedon theconcavesideoftheone.Althoughitisnot difficult toplan thistechnique,itcanbedifficult
to execute surgically.The wedge may not fit easily on the concave surface and can easily displace.The wedge
has no blood supply and is incorporated more slowly into the healing osteotomy site.
Oblique
Thissimple technique allowscorrectionof deformitiesinany ofthree planes(medial/lateral,cranial/caudaland
rotational).The osteotomy is best supported by an external fixator.Themostproximal and distal fixation pins
canbe insertedparallel totherespectivejointsurface andthereby actasmarkersforcorrectionofthedeformities.
Bone contactmaynotbegoodat theosteotomy site,resultingindelayed healing,and thus a cancellousbone
graft should beconsidered.Thetechnique allows correctionof all componentsofa deformity andsome increase
in bonc lcngth also,if necessary.The main disadvantage is an inherently less stable fixation because of less
cortical bone contact.Exact pre-operative planning is difficult and most of the correctionis doneby direct‘eye-
balling'by the surgeon.
Dome or crescentic
Theoretically this is a uscful tcchnique since the crescentic osteotomy acts as a ball andsocket,and three-plane
corrections of a deforinity can be made (Sikes et al.,1986;Stevens,1988).The osteotomy line has to be
accurately planned and is initially madewith a series of drill holes;the osteotomyis then completedwith a high
speed air diland fine burr rasmalloscillating bone saw.one platesprovidethemost secure ixation.
Unfortunately it is technicallyvery difficult to achieve thisosteotomy and itmust be done carefully.
Step
A step osteotomy allows distraction and lengthening of a bone.An autogeneous cancellous bone graft is
recommended.Lag screws can be used tosecure the arms ofthc stcp but additionalsupport in the form ofa plate
or external fixatorismandatory.The amount of bone length that can be crcatedis limited andfissure fractures
of the step are not uncommon.
Corticotomy/osteotomy and distraction osteogenesis
This concept has already been mentioned. Gradual distraction at the site of transection using a ring extcrnal
fixatorcanrcsult insignificantlengthening of thc bonc andsoft tissucs.This treatmentisthetechniqueofchoice
for the corrcction of shortencd bones but can also corrcct rotational and angular deformities.

Aetiology
There are several hypotheses but no firn conclusions on the cause of these tumours.Proposed aetiological
factors include:
Metal implants (Bennett et al.,1979;Gillcspic et al.,1988)
Corrosion (Furst and Haro,1969;Sinibaldi et al.,1976;Black,1981)
Excessive tissue damage
Altered cellular activity.
Fracturc-associated sarcomas may result from a two-stage carcinogenic event.The first stage may be
mutagenesisofthecellbybindingofmetaltoDNA,andtheactual carcinogeniceventmayoccurduringmultiple
mitoses resulting from excess callus formation,excess bone formation and the response to infections or
instability of theimplant.There arecertainly othercxamplesof sarcoma formation occurring inboncwhich has
prc-cxisting disease causing altered cellular activity.e.g.Paget‘s disease in humans (McKenna et al.,1966),
nutritional hyperparathyroidismincats (Riseret al.,1968)and infarcts of bone in humans and dogs (Riseretal.,
1972; Mirra et al., 1974).
Diagnosis
Thehistory ofapreviousfracture anditstreatmentisveryimportant.Typically these tumours are associatedwith
lameness or a gradually increasing mass which is noted by the owncr. The lameness may be of acute or gradual
onset.Painis an obviousfeature onpalpationof thebone.Oecasionally thereis involvenent of themusculature

history,clinicalexamination and radiographic appearance.Repeatradiographs at an interval of 2 to3weeks can
help to consolidate the diagnosis.
Treatment
The treatment of these fracture-associatcd tumours in the dog has all the same problems as that for the
spontaneous osteosarcoma.The fracture-associated tumours have the same tendency tometastasize as the

witha significant softtissueinvolvement,whichmakes limitedsalvageprocedurestechnicallyvery difficult.
Prevention
The overall incidence of fracture-associated sarcoma is very low and doesnot justify theroutine removal of
implants after fracture repair.However,in cases of complicated fracture repair, such asnon-union (and cvcn
delayed union)and certainlywith ostcomyelitis,removal of theinplant is justified andrecommended.

tumours is very rare (Table 26.3).
Complications of Fracture Healing339
Most of these sarcomas occurin the diaphysis of
long bones,particularly the femur.Over 85%of frac-
ture-associatcd sarcomas occur in the diaphysis of
long bones (Figure 26.18a)and not the metaphysis,as
withspontaneouslyoccurringosteosarcomas.Thebone
mostfrequentlyinvolvedisthefemur(49%),followcd
bythe humerus(24%),tibia(22%)and the radius(5%)
(Stevenson, 1991). Occasionally sarcomas develop
within6to9monthsofinternal fixationof ametaphy-
seal fracturc: thcsc are probablymanifestations of a
pre-existing spontaneous osteosarcoma; and in some
cases theoriginalfracturemayhave beena pathologi
calfracture since thetumour,eventhoughnotapparent
radiographically,may have weakened the bone.
Mctal implants,if present,are usually loose and
bacterial contamination of the tumour is often a fea-
ture.All subtypes of ostcosarcoma have been noted
andmetastases to lungs (Figure 26.18b),visceral or-
gans and other bones have becn rcported.The original
fracture usually occurs between the ages of 1 and 3
years and the lag period until tumour diagnosis avcr-
ages approximately 6years.They are most often en-
countcrcd in largcr brccds of dog and are also seen in
the cat.Fracture-associated sarcomas aremost likely
