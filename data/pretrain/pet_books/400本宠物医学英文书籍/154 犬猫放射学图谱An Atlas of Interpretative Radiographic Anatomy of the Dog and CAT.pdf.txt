Preface
In compiling the second edition of this atlas the authors
have concentrated on improving the reproduction of many
of the radiographs included in the first edition. Some
radiographs have been replaced and additional variant,
'pitfall', and contrast study radiographs are included.
New line and schematic drawings accompany a number of
the radiographs and will be seen to follow the original
format. The reader will also find a series of drawings
constructed, for the second edition, which act as guidance
for normal radiographic shadow sizes.
       g
referencing of key points in the more lengthy legends.
Additional labelling of some radiographs has been made
for text clarity.
A comprehensive contents list has been included prior to
each section and page headers expanded to detail the
radiograph illustrated.

Introduction
Aim of the book
The primary aim of this book is to provide a detailed
reference for the basic radiographic anatomy of the dog
and cat. This is achieved by the inclusion of both
radiographs and drawings.
The immature animal and, where relevant, a spectrum of
breeds have been included.
A selection of anatomical variants and a few of the more
following the‘normal radiograph.
Following the anatomical sections of plain radiography is a
series of the more commonly employed contrast studies.
Confusion can occur  when trying to interpret such
techniques, and many anatomical features can only be seen
with the aid of contrast agents. Hence these have been
included, hoping they aid evaluation of the studies
performed more regularly in general practice. In addition a
few of the less common studies are found for anatomical
understanding.
From personal experience in teaching and examining
veterinary
  surgeons  for    postgraduate   radiology
certification it is clear that a good basic knowledge of
radiographic anatomy is essential. Unfortunately, all too
often ^normality' is not recognised, especially where breed
variation has to be considered.
18
A short bibliography is in the last few pages of this book
The list includes only books and publications consulted,
and relevant, for the figures and text of this manuscript. No
individual references are cited in the text.
No index has been included as the atlas is intended to be
used as a visual reference for normality. To facilitate this a
comprehensive contents list, divided into anatomical
regions for plain and contrast radiography, is provided.
Although initially it would appear that the book is mainly
for the benefit of veterinary surgeons wanting to obtain
additional  radiology qualifications, basic radiographic
anatomy will be of value to both undergraduates and
veterinary surgeons in general practice. It is hoped that this
atlas will become a useful and well used reference book
for both the specialising and nonspecialising veterinary
audience.
Drawings
The line drawings follow tracings of the radiographs. Only
shadows seen in the radiograph have been traced, even if
anatomically more detail should have been present. Each
drawing has a detailed key.
It is hoped that the radiographic reproduction is of a
sufficient standard to allow recognition of all the
radiographic shadows that have been traced.
Where the shadows are complex, as in the skull, a number
       s
confusion of numerous lines within small regions
19
Every effort has been made not to overdraw or over-label
the drawings correlating to the radiographs. In this way it
is hoped that the reader will quickly recognise the
important shadows and become familiar with radiographic
anatomy.
Separate line drawings have also been included of soft
tissue structures surrounding bony shadows. These
structures are often overlooked when attention is focused
on the more obvious opaque shadows. Much valuable
information can be gained from the soft tissue surrounding,
for example, the stifle joint.
In addition to the line drawings, schematic drawings of
with anatomical features not visible on the radiograph. In
this way the reader will be more able to make logical
diagnosis/differential   diagnosis    when   faced 
with
radiographs demonstrating abnormal features.
Animals
Most of the radiographs in this book are original and for
the exclusive use of the authors. The remainder have been
given to the authors by generous colleagues.
The radiographs have been obtained over a period of five
  o s   s  s
The ‘normal dog radiographs are mainly from a group of
Beagle Hounds while the ‘normal’ cat radiographs are
from a number of individual British Domestic Short
Haired cats.
20
In both cases the radiographs were obtained specifically
for the book, radiography taking place in conjunction with
routine surgery or dentistry requiring general anaesthesia.
The different breeds, anatomical variants and radiographic
‘pitfall’ radiographs were either obtained primarily for this
book or were taken from veterinary college files. This was
probably one of the most difficult sections to complete for
publication as radiographs falling into ^variant’ or ^pitfall'
are not usually recorded.
The dog juvenile section was commissioned for this book
and radiography was performed on the same dog
(Samoyed crossbred entire male) from 1 month to 15
months of age at intervals of 1 month
This is probably the ideal situation for a juvenile study as
individual, feeding and housing variations are all under
control.
The study was based at University of Guelph in Ontario
Canada  under
the　watchful　eyeof　Professor
Sumner-Smith.
The cat juvenile section usually involved a different cat at
each monthly age. Individuals from a breeding group were
radiographed specifically for this book, during studies on
clinical anaesthesia based in Newcastle, England.
Although this is not ideal as some individual variation is
present, variations with feeding and housing were
eliminated. The significant advantage of undertaking the
work in this manner has been to ensure consistent
21
final radiographs. Radiography was from 4 weeks to 96
weeks of age at four-weekly intervals
All cats were entire and it was interesting to see the
differences in bone size between male and female cats.
The latter is especially relevant with the skull section.
The contrast study section radiographs were obtained from
college files spanning over 20 years from 1975 to 1995. It
medium, of any type, into a normal animal for the sole
purpose of this book.
Radiography
All radiography performed in England, specifically for this
book, was under the Ionising Radiation Regulations of
1985.
Every effort has been made to include only radiographs of
a high radiographic quality.
As a variety of X-ray machines and accessory equipment
have been used, no specific details of the equipment, nor
exposure details, are included in this book.
A comprehensive description of radiographic positioning
of the animal has purposely been excluded as there are a
number of excellent books on this subject. In addition it is
not the main objective of this atlas to teach positioning
22
Instead a line drawing, from a photograph of the live
'normal’ dog being radiographed, is to be found below the
relevant radiograph. Positioning for the ‘normal’ cat will
be similar.
The centre point for the primary beam has been indicated
on each drawing by a symbol varying with the
photographic exposure angle.
Normality
The quest for radiographs showing classic and completely
'normal’ radiographic anatomy proved to be very difficult
in a number of skeletal regions. So much so that it was
decided to include some radiographs which demonstrated
normal radiographic shadows of the bones which were to
be detailed in the keys but had evidence of degenerative
signs elsewhere.
In every case the bony degenerative changes were causing
no clinical signs. The reader is reminded that during
radiological analysis of clinical cases, over-interpretation
of obvious chronic bony degeneration can result in failure
to observe active bony changes elsewhere. In their early
stages acute skeletal lesions are soft tissue alterations
followed by subtle bony changes.
In the case of the stifle joint of the cat the absence of a
bony shadow for the medial fabella of the m.
gastrocnemius was commonplace. A craniocaudal shadow
of the femur has been included for the sole purpose of
showing this medial sesamoid bone.
23
With regards to the soft tissue radiographs of particular
note is the cat thorax which showed considerable cardiac
shadowvariation.
In addition to the cardiac shadow abnormal lung opacities
were commonly seen, especially affecting the right middle
lung lobe.
Radiographs of these lung opacities have not been
included in the book as it was considered to be too close to
seemingly clinically normal animals are something of
which the reader should be aware.
        
radiographic anatomy, plus bony degenerative changes.
Also a full range of what would be expected as ^normal’ is
included in the book.

This book could not have been possible without the
support of a vast number of people.
An enormous thank you to Dr Ray Ashdown, East Sussex.
UK, our anatomical and terminological consultant, for his
vast knowledge which has made such a vital and valuable
contribution to this book and which has been offered so
patiently during the preparation of this material.
Mr Jonathan Clayton-Jones, London, UK, has prepared the
numerous drawings, line and schematic, based on the
original tracings prepared by the authors. These represent
24
the culmination of many drafts and re-drafts to reproduce
satisfactorily for publication. Without his skill and
patience the interpretation of many of the radiographs to
the satisfaction of the authors would not have been
possible
Janet Butler at the Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, UK
has provided her expertise in preparing photographs from
many of the original radiographs.
Mr David Gunn at the Royal Veterinary College, London,
UK has kindly allowed line drawings to be prepared from
photographs of radiographic positioning prepared at the
College.
Our special thanks are extended to a number of veterinary
surgeons in general practice and academia who at the time
persevered with obtaining normal radiographs to fill the
gaps for the book.

The drawing has been included to indicate the presence of
a lateral sesamoid bone (arrow) in the elbow joint. The
sesamoid bone is more frequently seen on the lateral aspect
and is thought to be within the tendon of the m. supinator.
Occasionally a medial sesamoid bone is observed in the
collateral ligament and joint capsule.
Although both the lateral and medial sesamoid bones have
been cited as a cause of lameness by some authors, by
most authorities they are not clinically significant. Indeed
125
sesamoid cartilage is often present but non-mineralised.
hence can not be seen in a radiograph. In this particular
dog there was no forelimb lameness.

Glenoid cavity
/  variant.   Mediolateral
projection of shoulder joint (corresponds to radiograph not
included in book). Great Dane German Shepherd crossbred
dog 5 months old, entire male.
The drawing demonstrates a separate ossification centre
for the glenoid cavity (arrow). As the dog matures the
centre often forms a separate bony shadow parallel to the
glenoid cavity. This must not be mistaken for an
osteochondrosis fragment.
The variant seen here is most commonly found in the giant
breeds of dog, in particular the Irish Wolfhound.
133
A similar, separate ossification centre may occasionally be
seen at the acetabulum. Here the variant forms a separate
bony shadow parallel to the cranial effective acetabular
rim.
Care must be taken not to confuse this shadow with a
fracture fragment or ossicle. The smooth cortical outline of
the bony variant together with a normal acetabular shadow
enables differentiation from abnormality.
Retained cartilagenous core in ulna and immature
metaphyseal: Figure 79
Figure 79 Retained cartilaginous core. Mediolateral
projection of distal radius and ulna. (Corresponds to
radiograph not included in book.) Great Dane German
134
Shepherd crossbred dog 5 months old, entire male
The drawing shows a retained cartilaginous core (closed
arrows) in the distal ulna metaphyseal region. The core is
typically seen at this 5-month age, especially in the Great
Dane, although other large and giant breeds can be
affected.
Although at one time it was thought to retard growth its
presence alone is not significant and the core will
135
disappear as the dog matures. Note the normal growth
plates in this dog with the core.
Also present on the drawing is the typical irregular
cortical outline of the metaphyseal regions (open
arrows). The latter is invariably seen in large and giant
breeds of immature dogs. This together with a relatively
  s sr s an o e ao
immature dogs, must not be mistaken for a bony metabolic
abnormality such as rickets. Examination of the bony
cortical opacity, and thickness, are required to establish
normality in the immature animal.
Multipartite sesamoid bones in manus: Figure 80
Figure 80 Multipartite sesamoid bones. Dorsopalmar
projection of manus. Rottweiler dog 2 years old, entire
136
male. (Approximately 80% of original size.)
137
The radiograph shows the characteristic multiple bony
shadows associated with multipartite sesamoid bones.
The proximal sesamoid bones of the 2nd and 5th digits are
affected in this dog, numbers 2 and 7, these also being the
most commonly affected digits.
Multipartite sesamoid bones in the digits of immature, and
young, large breeds of dogs, in particular the Rottweiler,
have been reported to be involved with lameness. Such a
lameness has been called sesamoid disease but the exact
role of multipartite sesamoid bones remains unclear. In a
number of these cases attributed to abnormal sesamoid
bones, recovery was spontaneous and in others concurrent
skeletal abnormalities, known to be a cause of lameness,
were often present.
Reports of multipartite sesamoid bones affecting the
proximal sesamoid bones of the feet conclude that the
Rottweiler breed is ommonly predisposed but other large
breeds, such as the Labrador Retriever, can be affected.
Multipartite sesamoid bones are also found in the proximal
sesamoid bones of the hind foot. The variant is often
bilateral.
From the radiograph the smooth bony outline of the
multipartite sesamoid bones can be seen. This together
with the presence of a number of opaque bodies of
irregular shape allows differentiation from fractures as
seen in racing Greyhounds. Fractures of the 2nd and 7th
proximal sesamoid bones are well recognised in racing
Greyhounds.
138
Diagnosis of lameness due to proximal sesamoid bone
abnormality, be it multipartite with degenerative changes
or fractures, must be made with great caution. It is
generally accepted that the multipartite condition is a
normal variant of ossification and not clinically significant.
In addition even in fractures with racing Greyhounds it has
been shown to be unassociated with lameness.
Multipartite sesamoid bones can also be seen in the stifle
joint. The medial fabella of m. gastrocnemius (see Figure
187), fabella of m. popliteus and the patella have all been
sesamoid bodies.
Coat contamination in manus: Figures 81-82

The irregular well-defined radiopacities caused by dirt
between the metacarpal and digital pads, plus between
140
individual digital pads, in this foot show how important
patient preparation is.
Although the lumps of dirt in this case are large and
unlikely to be overlooked during radiography of the foot,
traces of dirt between the pads may easily be missed on a
routine inspection of the animal prior to radiography.
Wherever there are unusual shadows in the region of the
pads, careful examination of the skin's surface must be
undertaken. This also applies to any contamination of the
hair by solid or liquid material.

surface.  Mediolateral  projection   of  manus.  Collie
crossbred dog 10 years old, neutered male (same dog as in

The corresponding mediolateral projection to Figure 81
has been included to show that the obvious, extremely
radiopaque metallic fragment within the dirt on the
palmar surface of the foot, was not clearly seen in the
dorsopalmar projection.
Such a finding demonstrates the value of two projections
of the same region, even though one may appear to
suffice for diagnosis.

The radiograph demonstrates the unusual bony appendage
of the central tarsal bone that can be found in a number

congenital development of the 1st digit which is a breed
point for showing.

Teeth are anchored in bony sockets or alveoli. Parallel to
each tooth root is a region of clearly defined bony
radiopacity called the lamina dura (A). With age the
alveolar bone has radiopaque linear changes making the
lamina dura less obvious in radiographs.
Between the lamina dura and the tooth root is a radiolucent
shadow of the periodontal membrane (B).

and the alveolar crest (C) adjacent to the dental
cementoenamel junction. With age, some vertical bone
resorption can occur reducing this sharp angle.

resorption.  However,  idiopathic
resorption of roots in this region has been noted in
mature dogs.
G Vestibular surface roots of 1st molar (upper right)
461
In young dogs (under l year of age) root apices are
normally open.
To avoid confusion all roots have not been labelled. The
1st premolar has only one root, the 2nd and 3rd have two
roots (rostral and distal) while the 4th upper premolar, or
carnassial tooth, has three roots. Of the latter, two roots are
long and found on the vestibular surface, and the other is
much shorter on the lingual surface. The 4th lower
premolar is similar to premolars 2 and 3.
Considering the molars, the upper have two small
vestibular surface roots and one larger lingual surface
roots. The lower molars all have two roots but the lst is
very large and forms the lower carnassial tooth.

The radiograph has been included to show doming of the
cranium in toy breeds with the consequential reduction of
the frontal sinuses shadow. The sinuses in this particular
dog are almost entirely lost. In contrast some giant breeds
of dog, e.g. the Saint Bernard, have very large frontal
sinuses shadow.

The radiograph demonstrates the severe reduction in the
size of the nasal chambers found in this breed of dog. The
485
right 4th premolar tooth is congenitally absent in this
particular dog. Such an abnormality is not uncommon in
the brachycephalic breed of dog where the upper premolar
teeth are usually affected. Lower molar teeth can also be
congenitally absent.

Note that the right 3rd premolar is missing in this dog
This was a result of extraction and not a congenital
absence. The reduction of nasal chamber shadows is not
as great as in the Boston Terrier (Figure 286)

The radiograph, and corresponding drawing, demonstrates
a dorsal extension of the foramen magnum (shaded in
drawing). Such an extension is very common in the toy
breed of dog, but has been termed ^occipital dysplasia',
and hence an abnormality, by some authorities.
As ^occipital dysplasia' it has been linked to congenital or
developmental  neurological  dysfunction.  However, the
appearance of the foramen magnum, as seen in this
radiograph, can be found extensively in clinically normal
dogs and its presence in dogs exhibiting abnormal
neurological signs is not conclusive for a diagnosis. Hence
great care must be taken with the interpretation of this
radiographic shadow as it often reflects only a variant and
other conditions must be eliminated.

The radiograph shows curvature of the nasal septum, to
the left nasal chamber, at the mid chamber level. The bony
shadows dividing the two nasal chambers can be seen
midline and are intact. Positional variation of the nasal
septum, and the vomer (also see Figure 675, Siamese cat),
are sometimes seen and analysis of surrounding shadows
must be made to ensure that the deviation is not part of a
disease process such as neoplasia.
The left and right nasal chambers are symmetrical in this
dog, i.e. are normal.

Distance between numbers 9 and 10 is the caudal sagittal
diameter of the vertebral foramen.
Sagittal diameter measurements are used to evaluate
possible stenosis of foramen. Note that measurements
must always be compared cranially to cranially, caudally
to caudally, as cranial diameters are often smaller than
caudal ones in the normal dog. This is especially true for
the more caudal cervical vertebrae.
Evaluation of the relationship between adjacent ventral
foramen margins is also valuable. Measuring angles
between the margins is important to determine if stenosis
is  present.  Where  gross  radiographic  abnormality   is
523
present an obvious dorsal elevation of the cranial margin
with respect to the preceding caudal margin is seen.
Note that changes in lateral projection positions of the
cervical vertebrae will alter the relationship of all foramina
margins, as seen in the radiographic and drawing Figures
312-317.

This series of three radiographs has been included to
demonstrate the normal relationship between the 1st and
2nd  cervical  vertebrae  during extreme  flexion  and
extension of the neck. Note the dorsal space between the
1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae, or atlas and axis, which
shows little variation in the three projections. Also
593
observe the dorsal borders of the first two vertebrae to be
parallel to one another. The dens of the axis remains in a
ventral position within the vertebralcanal in all the
projections.
The atlas, axis and occipital condyle of the skull are all
of a normal size and conformation. Analysis of these
anatomical  characteristics is very  important for  this
particular region as abnormalities of this area, in toy
breeds, are well recognised. The atlas and the dens of the
axis are not reduced in size. The occipital condyle can be
seen to be a normal size and in the correct articular
position.

595
(block vertebrae - open arrows) as seen by the long
length of these vertebrae. Proximally the lst and 2nd
coccygeal  vertebrae are congenitally malformed having
wedge-shaped bodies (hemivertebrae - closed, straight
arrows).
Incomplete fusion of the 3rd sacral segment is also
present (curved arrow).

The radiograph has been included to demonstrate the
appearance of the atlas and axis after 1 week of age but
before 13 weeks of age.
611
The atlas still has a distinct separate ossification centre
for its body. This centre is not seen in the lateral projection
of cervical vertebrae of the 13-week-old Samoyed
crossbred dog, Figure 377.
Great care must be taken with interpretation of radiographs
from young animals. Knowledge of ossification centres is
essential. The ossification centre of the atlas body is
sometimes misdiagnosed as a fracture causing neurological
signs in dogs under 3 months of age.

(Approximately 70% of original size.)
The radiograph illustrates ‘rosettes’ of mineralisation
which occasionally develop in older dogs around their
costochondral junctions.
624
Mineralisation of the costal cartilages, varying from
granular stippling to uneven patches, may occur quite
commonly from a few months of age onwards. Such
mineralisations  are  not considered   of  any   clinical
significance.
In this radiograph mineralisation of the costal cartilages
extends from the costochondral to the costosternal
junctions.

Mineralisation of laryngeal cartilages is a normal ageing
process in the dog but can be present as early as 6-12
months of age. The mineralisation pattern and opacity vary
between the different cartilages and individual dogs. As in
this dog, thyroid and cricoid cartilages are the most
commonly affected and opacity will increase with age.

general anaesthesia with endotracheal tube removed for
clarity of radiographic shadows. Bulldog 5 years old,
632
entire female. (Approximately 130% of original size.)
The radiograph shows the vertical position of the hyoid
bones together with a much reduced oropharynx and
very large soft palate shadow. The nasopharynx is also
small and the endotracheal intubation has caused the
epiglottis (closed arrows) to lie ventrocranially.
On recovery from the general anaesthetic, when
swallowing reflexes return, the epiglottis will rotate
dorsocranially and come to rest just ventrocranially to the
soft palate.
Note the large retropharyngeal space (open arrow)
which is normal in this type of breed but does create an
apparent ventral displacement of the laryngeal cartilages.

Pericardium and heart
Cranial border
1 Right auricle
2 Right ventricle
In this radiograph the aortic arch is not visible but it can
often be seen as a separate structure.Very rarely the
cranial border of the pulmonary artery is seen.
Note that the aortic arch can be seen in the respiratory
system radiographs and drawings, Figures 418 and 420
A small indentation can sometimes be seen in the
craniodorsal border of the cardiac shadow representing the
junction of the cranial vena cava and the cranial border.
636
This is known as the cranial waistline. In this radiograph
the pulmonary vessels are obscuring the waistline level.
Caudal border
3 Left atrium. Dorsally obscured by pulmonary vessels.
4 Left ventricle
The junction between the atrium and ventricle is usually
marked by a definite sulcus in the caudal border as it
curves cranially. This is known as the caudal waistline
and is found at the level of the ventral border of the caudal
vena cava. Unlike the cranial waistline it is often a
consistent finding in the normal cardiac shadow. In this
radiograph the caudal waistline is not obvious.
5 Dorsal base
6 Apex
The pericardium, the fibroserous sac surrounding the heart,
is not seen as a separate structure. In very obese dogs fat
can
accumulate within the sac and the middle
mediastinum. Even so, the fat opacity may not be readily
interpreted  as  a  different tissue and without  careful
evaluation  of  the cardiac  shadow  a  misdiagnosis of
'cardiac enlargement' can be made.
Note that the right lateral recumbent projection of thorax is
preferred for the cardiac shadow as the caudoventral fold
of the mediastinum (anatomically the phrenicopericardial
ligament) acts to anchor the apex. Although small there are
637
noticeable differences in the cardiac, caudal vena cava and
aortic silhouettes in right and left lateral recumbencies (see
respiratory system radiographs, Figures 418 and 423)
Vascular
7Aortic arch.Occasionally an ill-definedshadow
representing an outflow vessel from this arch is seen in the
right lateral recumbent projection of thorax (not present in
this radiograph).
8 Thoracic aorta
9 Level of cranial vena cava
The cranial vena cava cannot be seen as a separate
structure but will be found at the ventral level of the
cranial mediastinal shadow. It is formed at a level cranial
to the thoracic inlet.
10 Caudal vena cava. (In this projection it is seen entering
the central tendon of the diaphragm just right of the
midline.) In most right lateral recumbent projections of
thorax the entry is clearly defined as right sided and can be
used to confirm recumbency.
11 Right cranial lobe artery
12 Right cranial lobe vein
13 Left cranial lobe vein
638
The left cranial lobe artery can not be clearly seen in this
u au o [nua isn iasad aq lm i inq qdeop
cranial lobe vein.
Radiolucent shadows between the paired cranial vessels
are the corresponding lobe bronchial lumen. These should
not be mistaken for the abnormal air bronchograms. Often
the bronchial walls are also visible and in this radiograph
the most dorsal portions are just seen as fine radiopaque
lines (14).
15 Artery and vein of caudal segment of left cranial lobe
cranially
16 Artery and vein of right middle lobe caudally
17 Right pulmonary artery and veins. Right pulmonary
artery when seen as a separate structure, passes ventral to
the tracheal bifurcation and is a round/oval soft tissue
opacity in its end-on projection.
18 Left pulmonary artery and veins. Left pulmonary artery
crosses the trachea, passing cranial to the tracheal
bifurcation.
The left vascular trees are located just dorsal to the right
but identification is very difficult. Also differentiating
between artery and vein is hard. However arteries usually
are more opaque, often slightly curved and are more well
defined. Veins are usually shorter and stubbier. In
addition arteries are located following the bronchial tree
whereas veins travel to the left atrium via the shortest
route.

Heart size over 10.6 may usually be considered as
enlargement.
Caution
Some breeds of dog regularly exceed 10.6, e.g.
Golden Retriever, Boxer, Pharaoh Hound and
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.
Always remember to look for signs of cardiac
failure when cardiac size is being assessed. Even if
cardiac enlargement is apparent, clinical signs will
be due to failure not enlargement.
Serial cardiac size using VHS
Although the VHS is only a guidance for cardiac
enlargement, it can act as a useful size monitor for
serial thoracic radiographs of the same dog. The
latter will aid in assessing response to cardiac
therapy.

Care must be taken in identifying arteries and veins in
this  projection   as  the   mineralised  costal  cartilage

sets of shadows one must trace the full course of the
shadows.
Shadows of the mineralised costal cartilages will be seen
to travel caudally then curve cranially at, or near, the
costochondral junctions.
To avoid confusion the mineralised costal cartilages and
bony rib shadows have been excluded from the drawing
but the reader should now identify these shadows. A

well-inflated lung lobes. Occasionally this shadow may
appear more lucent than the adjacent right cranial lung
lobe shadow.
2 Cranial limit of the right cranial lung lobe
3 Lucent shadow created by right middle lung lobe. This
lung lobe is larger than the corresponding caudal segment
of the left cranial lung lobe. Its presence at full inflation
between the cardiac and sternal shadows should not be
mistaken for free pleural gas. Pulmonary opacities can
be seen in the lucent region so confirming lung tissue.
661
Note that there is no left middle lung lobe in the dog
4 Dorsal limit of caudal lung lobes. (The limit is more
dorsal than normal, caused by positional rotation of the
dog during radiographic exposure, as seen by rib shadows
superimposed over vertebral canal.) In a non-rotated lateral
projection of the thorax the limit is at the level of the
dorsal edge of vertebral body.

Bronchial markings, as labelled above, are a normal
feature in older dogs. Also the appearance of the pleura is
not uncommon. In addition nodular, linear and circular
interstitial opacities will be found, as in this 7-year-old
dog. The lung shadows in this Figure should be compared
with the ones found in the cardiovascular system right
lateral recumbent radiograph, Figure 406. In the latter the
dog is 2.5 years old.
Opacity changes will start to appear from approximately 4
years of age but environmental factors have to be
considered e.g. town versus country (urban/rural). The
opacity changes represent fibrous tissue and, or,
mineralisation of bronchial and interstitial tissues. They
are more pronounced, and occur at a younger age, in the
chondrodystrophic breeds.

If  lung pathology is suspected in one hemithorax,
radiography must ensure that in the lateral projection that

may prove impractical if respiratory distress is severe.

thorax, Figure 420.
In addition with the ventrodorsal projection the more
lateral areas often appear more opaque due to the
presence of skin folds (19). Skin folds are distinguished
from thoracic cavity structures by following their
continuous shadows beyond the cavity limits. Folds must
not be mistaken for abnormal lung lobes.

The dorsoventral projection has been included in this
section to show that even with fully inflated lungs, the
area of lung exposed is less in this projection as compared
with the ventrodorsal. This effect is smaller in the cat but
678
with this species the thoracic cavity is greatly reduced, and
appears more triangular, when the front limbs are not
extended forwards.
The dorsoventral projection should always be used for
cardiovascular evaluation  as  cardiac  position  is not
altered, also the caudal pulmonary vessels are more
clearly defined. However the caudal vena cava is better
evaluated in the ventrodorsal projection. Note that the
cardiac shadow is wider but shorter in the dorsoventral
compared to the ventrodorsal projection.
The ventrodorsal projection is preferable for lung tissue
evaluation. It also shifts pleural fluid dorsally and cranial
mediastinal shadows are clearer. However this position
may be clinically contraindicated.
It must also be remembered that the ventrodorsal and/or
dorsoventral  projection(s)  should  be  performed first,
before the recumbent lateral projections. Hypostatic
congestion/lung
lobe collapse
  occurs   rapidly

recumbent  animals  suffering  from cardiovascular or

mediastinum in obese old dogs. Dogs of the smaller
breeds, and especially the brachycephalic breeds, are
prone to accumulate fat in the cranial mediastinum. Fat
may  also develop in the cranioventral mediastinum
resulting in a dorsal elevation of the cardiac shadow.
Fat accumulation, as referenced above, must not be
misdiagnosed as a pathological condition. Knowledge of
breed variation, plus radiographic opacity evaluation, is
required for correct interpretation of thoracic radiographs
A number of radiographs follow the ‘normal’ dog
radiographs to illustrate the above comments

is due to the anatomical shape of the chest and not a
      
throughout both areas.

The radiograph has been included to demonstrate the
normal appearance of the cardiac shadow in the Golden
Retriever. Although the breed has a normal or intermediate
shape chest, the cardiac shadow appears large and has an
unusual shape. Note the increase in sternal contact and
height at the level of the 5th rib. In addition the shape of
the shadow is more 'globular' than expected.
695
The Border Collie, Springer Spaniel, Newfoundland and St
Bernard all have large cardiac shadows. In addition they
may exhibit a more rounded outline than for the normal or
intermediate shape chest.

The radiograph demonstrates  the rounded  cardiac
shadow, with increase in sternal contact, caused by a
horizontal position of the heart within the thoracic cavity.
Cardiac measurements, when compared to a normal or
intermediate chested breed of dog, are greater in the
craniocaudal direction.
The comparatively large craniocaudal measurement
together with rounding of cranial cardiac border and
increase in stermal contact must not be misdiagnosed as
right-sided cardiac enlargement (atrial and ventricular).

seen in the short, barrel chested dog (see Figure 454)

The radiograph shows the rounded left and right cardiac
borders seen in this type of chested breed of dog.
Rounded cardiac apex is more left of the midline when
compared to the normal or intermediate chested breed of
dog. The apical level is due to the oblique position of the
heart across the thoracic cavity's midline.
700
As with the right lateral recumbent projection of thorax,
the appearance of the cardiac shadow in the short, barrel
chested breed of dog must not be confused with right-sided
cardiac enlargement (atrial and ventricular).
Also note the fat deposition mimicking a wide cranial
mediastinum and right-sided cardiac enlargement (see fat
deposition within thoracic cavity, Figure 452).

The radiograph shows the “upright' appearance of the
cardiac shadow. This is caused by the position of the heart
within the thoracic cavity being almost perpendicular to
the thoracic spine. Cardiac measurements, when compared
to a normal or intermediate chested breed of dog, are less
in  the craniocaudal direction  and
1greater in   the
dorsoventral direction.
Care must be taken when analysing this type of cardiac
shadow as the upright appearance, especially of the caudal
border, may be 
 misdiagnosed as  left-sided cardiac
interpreted.

Bulldog 18 months old, entire female (same dog as in

In the conscious dog note the very opaque appearance of
all the lung tissue, especially cranially; also the apparent
narrowing of the trachea at the thoracic inlet and the “large
globular' cardiac shadow.
In the anaesthetised dog, which is now more properly
positioned with full inflation of lung lobes, the lung tissue
has lost its extremely opaque appearance. Also the
trachea is normal in width, the cardiac shadow has
reduced in size and is less rounded in outline
Unfortunately due to rotation of the chest full analysis of
the cardiac shadow is not possible. However the Bulldog
will have a cardiac shadow typical of a short, barrel
chested breed of dog.
An enlarged aortic shadow (similar to that in the aged cat,
Figures731
1and 732) is sometimes seen in the
brachycephalic breeds, especially the Bulldog.

The radiograph confirms that lung opacity is normal in
both right and left lung lobes, as indicated in the right
lateral recumbent projection of thorax with full inflation of
lung lobes.
Note the rudimentary clavicles which are commonly seen
in the ventrodorsal and dorsoventral projections of thorax.
Also at the 12th rib level shadows of right and left nipples
709
can be seen as distinct soft tissue shadows superimposed
that nipple shadows are not misdiagnosed as neoplastic
masses.

710
(Approximately 60% of original size.)
711
The radiograph demonstrates the radiopaque appearance
caused by hypostatic congestion of the left cranial lung
lobe (cranial and more especially caudal parts). The
congestion is collapsing of dependant lung tissue while in
left lateral recumbency prior to the ventrodorsal projection
being taken.
Once collapse has occurred full reinflation for a normal
lung appearance is very difficult to achieve.
Although this radiograph demonstrates a normal
phenomena, that will occur in any dependant lung tissue,
following prolonged
1 lateral
1 recumbency, hypostatic
congestion of abnormal lung tissue can occur within
minutes of lateral recumbency. Hence in radiography of
clinical cases ventrodorsal or dorsoventral projections
should   precede
lateral
recumbent
projections
(remember    that    ventrodorsal
 projection
 may
be
contraindicated in cases of severe dyspnoea).

(Approximately 55% of original size.)
The radiograph shows changes within the bronchial walls
and interstitial lung tissue creating an opaque mixed
bronchialinterstitial pattern. The pattern has both linear
and circular opacities associated with bronchial wall
thickening. Interstitial involvement is also present in the
form of linear and micronodular opacities (unless
mineralised, nodules are only visible when 3 mm, or
larger, in size). The vascular patterm is somewhat obscured
by the increased interstitial radiopacity
Such changes can commonly be seen in dogs over 4 years
of   age (so  called
progressive and in dogs over l0 years of age the
may be difficult to differentiate from severe disease.
713
Urban dogs are more prone to the bronchial-interstitial
changes but certain breeds appear to be more predisposed.
In    particular   chondrodystrophic   breeds 
have
mineralisation of their bronchial walls as they age but
changes are often seen before 4 years of age and even at 1

The radiograph demonstrates dorsal elevation of the
cardiac shadow away from the bony sternum. Ventral to
the cardiac shadow the grey opacity of fat tissue can be
Seen.
Loss of sternal contact of the cardiac shadow caused by fat
deposition must not be mistaken for a pneumothorax. In
the latter case the black shadow of air will be seen ventral
to the cardiac shadow.
Dorsal elevation of the cardiac shadow by fat deposition is
more frequently seen in the dog than the cat.
The fat deposition has also made the ventral lung lobe
margins  appear  somewhat retracted cranially  and
715
scalloped caudally. This appearance of the lung lobes must
not be misinterpreted as atelectasis caused by free pleural
fluid.

The radiograph shows the effect of fat accumulation
within the cranial mediastinum making this area appear
wider than normal (closed, straight arrows). The grey
opacity of fat can be seen labelled (l). The soft tissue
opacity of the cranial mediastinum is labelled (2)
Also present is fat deposition in the ventral
mediastinum and pericardial sac. This is seen to mimic
cardiac ‘enlargement'. The grey fat opacity outline is
labelled (open arrows) while the cardiac soft tissue outline
is labelled (curved arrows).
Although this fat accumulation is seen more commonly in
the chondrodystrophic breed of dog, any obese dog or cat
can have fat deposits in the regions described above.
Of note is the cardiac shadow which is typical of a short.
barrel chested breed of dog. The left and right borders are
both rounded and the rounded cardiac apex is positioned to
the far left. The apex site is caused by the oblique
positioning of the heart across the midline in this type of
chest (see Figure 444).

3 False tracheal collapse. Hyperextended
lateralprojection of trachea. Radiograph taken during
general anaesthesia at full inspiration. Yorkshire Terrier
dog 10 years old, neutered female. (Approximately 130%
717
of original size.)
The radiograph shows an apparent narrowing of the
cervical tracheal lumen (arrow). The 'narrowing' is due
to an overlying soft tissue shadow of the oesophagus and
ventral neck muscles.
This soft tissue shadow at the dorsal aspect of the trachea
commonly creates a “false' tracheal collapse, especially
with hyperextension of the neck. Differentiation from
abnormality is aided by studying the pharyngeal spaces
and thoracic trachea. Pharyngeal air spaces and the
thoracic trachea are of a normal size, i.e. are not
enlarged, in this dog.
If there is doubt in interpretation of tracheal collapse
further radiography must be undertaken. This includes
lateral projections of the cervical and thoracic trachea,
with the neck in a normal extended position, both at full
inspiration and full expiration.  In cases of tracheal
collapse, collapse of cervical trachea will be seen at
inspiration while thoracic trachea collapses at expiration.
718
Alternatively, or additionally, a cross section of the lower
cervical tracheal  shadow  can be obtained by  special
tracheal positioning.  While the dog is in  stermal
recumbency the neck is hyperflexed. The vertical primary
beam is then directed tangentially to the trachea.

The radiograph highlights the atonic effect of general
anaesthesia on the oesophagus. This type of atony must
not be misdiagnosed as an abnormality of the muscle, or
even as an enlargement, ie. megaoesophagus. The

oesophagus will return to its normal size, and function,
following recovery from the general anaesthetic.

Although cardiac shadow analysis should be made from
the right lateral recumbent projection, the cardiac shadow
here is typical of a short, barrel chested breed of dog
(see Figure 442).
Cardiac shadow appears more horizontal  in thoracic
position with increase in stermal contact. This effect gives
rounding of cardiac borders and the craniocaudal
measurement of the heart is larger than compared with the
normal or intermediate chested breeds of dog
Most terrier breeds of dog have this type of cardiac
shadow.

A nipple may be large enough to produce a distinct

The radiograph shows a gas pocket depicting a congenital
oesophageal diverticulum at the thoracic inlet (arrow).
Diverticula in this region of the oesophagus are not
uncommon especially in the brachycephalic breed of
dog. Usually they are of no clinical significance.
The presence of gas in the oesophagus is normal for an
animal under a general anaesthetic. However, any evidence
of oesophageal gas in the conscious animal must be
treated with suspicion as it indicates abnormal oesophageal
function.

The radiograph shows the more opaque appearance of
lung tissue in the very young animal. This opacity is
thought to be due to fluid within the interstitial tissue not
present in the adult. It must not be misdiagnosed as
disease.
Also of note is the large cardiac shadow. Young dogs of
every breed, that is all type chested breeds, have
comparatively large cardiac  shadows with rounded
borders and increase in sternal contact. Again the
shadow must not be confused with an abnormality.
723
When adult the Weimaraner cardiac shadow would be the
normal or intermediate chested breed of dog (see Figure
406).

The radiograph demonstrates a linear radiopaque
interstitial pattern which is normal for a dog of this age.
Some bronchial markings are also present where the
interstitial fluid has involved the peribronchial tissue.
The cardiac  shadow appears to have enlargement
especially of the cranial border or right ventricle. A
ventral indentation can be seen at the junction of the right
724
and left ventricle. These signs must not be mistaken for
cardiac abnormality as a dog of 20 weeks of age normally
has a large cardiac shadow compared to the adult.
The Labrador Retriever dog is a normal or intermediate
chested breed of dog and when mature this dog will lose its
apparent right-sided cardiac enlargement.

Although the radiograph shows the radiopaque
appearance of the lung lobes, which is usually seen in the
immature animal, the long woolly coat of this dog has
725
caused an additional mottled soft tissue opacity over the
entire thorax. However the linear and circular lung opacity
of the interstitial and bronchial tissue can still be
identified
The  cardiac  shadow  appears  abnormally  rounded,
especially the cranial border. This is normal for a short,
barrel chested breed of dog at 25 weeks of age.

The extreme rounding of the borders, especially the
cranial border or right ventricle, has disappeared.
The lung tissue still appears opaque at this age but repeat
radiography, of the same dog at 52 weeks old, showed
overall reduction of both interstitial and bronchial patterms.
Cardiac shadow at the 52 weeks of age was similar in size
and shape as in this 38-week film.

In immature dogs the left lobe of the thymus is sometimes
seen, appearing as a ‘sail'-shaped area of soft tissue
opacity. It projects from the cranial mediastinum
caudolaterally and to the left (arrow). This should not be
confused, particularly when narrow, with a reverse fissure
line. The latter is a radiographic abnormality representing
mediastinal fluid.
Also of note is the wide cranial mediastinal shadow
created by the presence of the thymus tissue in this age of

ligaments supporting the liver. A right lateral recumbent
projection shows the dorsal extent of the liver to be less in
The liver shadow is slightly more caudally positioned
during inspiration but most adbominal radiography is
performed during expiration.

shadow. There is variation in the normal appearance of the
gastric shadow relative to the shape of the thorax and
cranial abdomen (see below).

recumbency.

Guidance for normal gastric size
Width of fundus and proximal body should be less
than 3 intercostal spaces wide and approximately 2
times the width of the pyloric part. Gastric size best
achieved in right lateral recumbency.
Variation   of normal  apperance  of  gastric
shadow with breed of dog
Short, barrel chested breeds of dog have a wider
fundus and body. The pyloric part is narrower.
Liver shadow in this breed of dog appears larger
due to the caudoventral angle projecting more
caudally into the costal arch.
Deep, narrow chested breeds of dog have a long,
slender gastric shadow. The pyloric part is similar
in width.
733
Liver shadow in this breed of dog appears smaller
as the caudoventral angle may only just be visible
at the costal arch.
17 Duodenal shadow (seen due to the presence of luminal
gas contrast)
18 Jejunum and ileum (seen due to the presence of luminal
gas contrast)
Loops of bowel are normally visible, their lumens filled
with gas or fluid, or a mixture of both. The mixture of
luminal gas and fluid can mimic wall ‘thickening' when
lateral recumbent projections are taken. This is caused by
the fluid lining the lumen being in contact with the wall
while gas is in the centre of the lumen. Fluid and soft
tissue have the same radiographic opacity and hence can
not be differentiated between in plain radiographs. A
bowel fluid line, i.e. a gas and fluid interface, will only be
seen in lateral standing projections of the abdomen.
In the dog radiographed for this film, very little abdominal
intraperitoneal fat was present. This resulted in poor soft
tissue contrast and has made the gas-filled gastrointestinal
shadows most obvious.
The long jejunum is indistinguishable from the short
ileum and generally the diameter of all the bowel is
equal. It has been noted that the terminal ileum can be
greater in diameter as it approaches the caecum. The
734
terminal ileum is usually located in the central abdomen.

been reported to be as high as 3.5 times the length
of the vertebral body. Both kidneys are similar in
size. Kidney size best achieved in ventrodorsal
projection.
Kidneys and ureters are retroperitoneal. Ureters are not
visible in the normal dog in plain films
25 Region of urinary bladder
Although not seen in this film, the urine filled bladder is
usually clearly identifiable. It extends cranially in a
ventral position.
The genital system of the non-pregnant normal female
dog is not usually seen without contrast material.
26 Sublumbar muscles: m. psoas minor, m. iliopsoas and
m. quadratus lumborum.
736
Also included in this shadow are ureters, lymph nodes
plus aorta, caudal vena cava and other vessels.
The shadow gradually decreases in opacity caudal to the
4th lumbar vertebra as the m. iliopsoas diverge to insert on
the proximal femora. The m. quadratus lumborum inserts
on the wing of the ilium. The caudal vena cava forms from
the iliac veins and aorta divides to form the left and right
intermal and extermnal iliac arteries.

the caudal ribs.
This layer usually serves to separate the m. obliquus
extermus abdominis from the m.  obliquus internus
abdominis and m. transversus abdominis. Unfortunately
the fat layer is too thin to clearly distinguish between the
two muscle layers in this female dog

Variation  of normal  appearance of  gastric
shadow with breed of dog
Short, barrel chested breeds of dog have more
convex caudal shadow. The pyloric part is more
medial in position.
Deep, narrow chested breeds of dog have a more
transverse cranial shadow. The pyloric part is more
cranial in position.
742
19 Duodenal shadow (seen due to the presence of gas in
the lumen)
20 Jejunum and ileum (seen due to the presence of gas in
the lumen). Prolonged either left or right lateral
recumbency will cause a displacement of a large degree
of jejunal and ileal shadows to the dependant side.
See (18) in left lateral recumbent projection of abdomen of

Although the dorsoventral projection is not routinely used
as a standard abdominal projection, comparison of the
ventrodorsal and dorsoventral projections, in the same
female dog, highlights how
free gaswithinthe
gastrointestinal  tract  changes  position.  In  addition
structures further away from the filmed cassette e.g.
kidneys (in the dorsoventral projection) are less well
defined. Also note the shape of the pelvis in the
dorsoventral projection, as opposed to the usual
appearance in the ventrodorsal projection.

Right lateral recumbent projection  of

For a routine survey radiograph of the abdomen, a right
lateral
recumbency  is often preferred by many
radiographers/ radiologists. The most important factor is
being  consistent  with  one'sradiographic approach  and
hence radiographic appraisal and interpretation.

14 Pyloric part, antrum and canal, of gastric shadow. (Seen
as a rounded soft tissue shadow due to the presence of
fluid gravitating to this part in right lateral recumbency.
The most ventral aspect of shadow is antrum.)
763
The pyloric part shadow in right lateral recumbency can
be mistaken for a ball within the gastric lumen. However,
recumbency as fluid shifts to the dependent gastric fundus.
Radiography  of both  lateral recumbencies is  very
important for all gastric region analysis.
15 Jejunum and ileum. (Seen as fluid-filled viscera with a
few lumenal gas shadows.)

descending colon. They may be termed 'redundant colon'
and are only abnormal if dilation is associated with the
curvature. *Redundant colon’ is seen more frequently in
the larger breeds of dog.)
Numbers 17 to 19 should be compared with the same
shadows seen in left lateral recumbency drawing, Figures
473 and 476. The different appearances are due to the
shifting lumenal gas contrast. Identification of intestinal
shadows may require both lateral recumbencies.

The radiograph demonstrates incomplete ossification of
the base of the os penis (arrow) which has resulted in a
roughened and fragmented appearance. This must not be
confused with the presence of urethral calculi.
Deep, narrow chested breed with long shallow abdomen:

long, shallow abdomen. Right lateral recumbent
projection of abdomen. Afghan Hound dog 2 years old,
796
entire female. (Approximately 60% of original size.)
The radiograph shows the economical use of space for the
gut viscera in this type of abdomen. This dog was also
very lean, emphasising the narrow appearance of the
abdomen.
The lack of fat contrast makes differentiation of soft tissue
structures more difficult but in this type of abdomen left
kidney shadow can sometimes be seen to cause 'ventral
displacement' of the descending colon, e.g. in Great
Danes. When seen in this type of breed, the colonic
position is due to the long, shallow abdomen and not to
disease.
When the gastric shadow is non-distended, intestinal
shadows may be seen in a more craniodorsal position,
just caudal to the diaphragm.

Figure501
Figure501
Colon variant. Right lateral recumbent
projection of abdomen. Samoyed dog 6 years old, entire
female. (Approximately 70% of original size.)
The radiograph shows extreme ventral positioning of the
descending colon. Such a ventral deviation may be linked
to displacement by an abnormal organ, especially a
neoplastic left kidney. In this case the shadows dorsal to
the colon are within normal radiographic limits and both
kidneys are visible.
798
The large amount of abdominal fat in this dog has
enhanced contrast making identification of soft tissue
shadows easier.
The retroperitoneal space also contains substantial fat
 o  s   s on o  
number of blood vessels. Note the linear and circular soft
tissue opacities (arrows).
The ventrodorsal projection of this dog has not been
included but the descending colon was in the normal left
abdominal position.
The descending colon commonly has another positional
variation. This is to be found on the ventrodorsal or
dorsoventral projections where the descending colon is
curved towards the midline and not running parallel to the
abdominal wall. Again careful evaluation of radiographic
shadows is necessary to ensure that a disease process is not
the cause of the unusual colonic position. Prolonged right
lateral recumbency and a distended urinary bladder
will predispose to a midline position of the descending
colon.

Pneumoperitoneum is occasionally used as a diagnostic
technique but it does occur naturally after intra-abdominal
Surgery. It manifests as focal areas of gas lucency,
irregular in outline but conforming to, and highlighting,
the serosal surfaces of the adjacent viscera.
patterns of gas within the intestines and elsewhere may be
seen in the absence of associated gut shadows. In this
radiograph the pooling of some free peritoneal fluid has
caused loss of intestinal serosal detail, most marked in
the mid-ventral region.

In the juvenile section of the Samoyed crossbred dog
radiography of the axial skeleton was not performed until
13 weeks of age. Note the appearance of the atlas and
axis in this dog, especially the separate ossification
centres for the atlas body and the axis dens. These must
not be confused as fractures. Compare this figure with the
4-week whole body of puppy (Figure 503).

Absence of abdominal fat tissue

 Absence of abdominal fat tissue in the

(Approximately 100% of original size.)
The radiograph shows the effect of lack of abdominal fat
which results in marked reduction of contrast within the
abdominal cavity. Most of the distinct inner surface of the
abdominal wall and serosal surface of bowel are lost.
Differentiation of viscera is only possible in this
radiograph by the presence of gas, ingesta and faecal
material. A very small amount of grey opacity, fat, is seen
outlining the caudoventral lobe of the liver separating it
from the soft tissue opacity of the ventral abdominal wall.
804
This abdominal radiograph is typical of the young animal
    s      
somewhat mottled appearance of the opaque abdomen may
be misdiagnosed as peritonitis (also see Figure 756 of the
mature animal with extreme loss of abdominal fat
contrast).

gastrocnemius. The medial fabella is commonly not seen
in radiographs. This is usually due to non-mineralisation
of the sesamoid fibrocartilage rather than agenesis.

Although this projection would appear simple to achieve
note the cranial position of the 1st coccygeal vertebra.
This cranial extent of the 1st coccygeal vertebra creates an
exposure problem when radiography of the whole
1126
coccygeal region is required. Often the caudal sacral/
proximal coccygeal area is underexposed in order not to
overexpose the thinner distal coccygeal vertebrae.
The most common error is to underestimate the cranial
position of the 1st coccygeal vertebra and hence not to
include the caudal sacrum/proximal coccygeal area in the
primary beam.

Pericardium and heart
Cranial border
1 Right auricle
2 Right ventricle
In this projection the aortic arch is not visible but a large
aortic arch is more commonly seen in the cat than the
dog. It appears as a distinct bulge at the cranial border, at
or below the right auricle level, extending into the cranial
mediastinum. Where the aortic arch covers the cranial
waist the cardiac shadow appears cranially tilted with an
increase in sternal contact.
Caudal border
3 Left atrium
4 Left ventricle
Although the cat has a cranial and caudal waistline, as in
the dog, using
gthese asaguideline for cardiac
enlargement is not as straightforward, particularly for the
caudal waistline. Separation of left atrium and left
ventricle is more difficult and enlargements often do not
affect the waistline.
5 Base
6 Apex
1157
Fat accumulation  within  the pericardial  sac is only
occasionally seen in the cat but care must be taken to
differentiate between soft tissue and fat opacities. In this
radiograph fat opacity is visible outside the pericardium
on the ventral thoracic cavity wall (7).
The right lateral recumbency is preferred for the cardiac
shadow, as discussed in the dog section. In addition the
projection should be at full inflation of the lung lobes.
This film is not as fully inflated as the left lateral
recumbent projection of thorax of the same cat, Figure
733. As such the vascular shadows are more prominent
and the cardiac shadow is slightly cranially tilted. However
craniocaudal and dorsoventral cardiac measurements for
both projections are the same.
Right lateral recumbent projection, with drawing, and left
lateral recumbent projection of thoracic cavity in forced
inflation, or over-inflation, of lung lobes, Figures
728-730, have been included to show the effect of "loss' of
shadow caused by hyperinflation.

9 Ventral limit of cranial vena cava
10 Caudal vena cava
1158
11 Cranial lobe artery
12 Cranial lobe vein
The radiolucent shadow between the paired cranial
vessels is the lumen of the cranial lobe bronchus. It should
not be mistaken for an air bronchogram. An air
bronchogram is a characteristic radiographic feature of an
alveolar pattern. The latter occurs in diseases which cause
an infiltration into the alveoli. Soft tissue opacity replaces
the alveolar air lucency. This results in adjacent air-filled
lumens of the bronchi becoming visible.
Bronchial walls are not generally visible in the cat unless
they are diseased.
13 Pulmonary artery and veins
The arrangement of pulmonary veins is different in the
cat compared to the dog. In the dog the veins are
symmetrically arranged as left and right sets of lobar veins.
In the cat there are three groups draining: the two parts
of the left cranial lobe; the middle and cranial lobes of the
right side; and caudal lobes of right and left lungs. Each of
these groups is of two or three veins and they are not
symmetrically
y arranged.
．Hence
radiographic
differentiation of veins in the cat is very difficult.

In this radiograph the appearance of the right and left
'crura’ would suggest left rather than right recumbency.
Identification of lateral recumbency is more difficult in
the cat than the dog. Often ‘crura’ are superimposed and.
as in this radiograph, are misleading.
Entry of the caudal vena cava is usually unhelpful leaving
only the gastric gas, caudal to the left ^crura', as a guide
for recumbency analysis.  In this radiograph insufficient
gas was present to show the presence of the gastric fundus
caudal to the left ^crura'.

'Variations?
It is widely reported that the cat has a fairly standard
shape and size for its cardiac shadow, compared to the
breed variation seen in dogs.
With  this  assumption  radiographically  normal  thoracic
projections, from clinically normal cats with no evidence
of cardiac abnormalities, should have been relatively easy
to obtain (see ^Normality’ in the Introduction). This was
not the case as many cats were found to have cardiac
‘enlargements’ from their radiographic shadows.

Ratio of B:C is normally 1:1
Vertebral heart size (VHS)
The VHS can be used in the cat. using the
same method as in the dog (see Figure 411).
In the cat a cardiac measurement of A+B.in
excess of 8. is considerod as cnlangemcm.
Caution
Giant brceds of cat such as the Maine Coon
may xceed the Borml VHS. In addition the
shape of the cardiac shadow in such breeds is
oflen more rounded.

lobes. British Domestic Short Haired cat 10 months old,
entire female (same cat as in Figures 729 and 740)
(Approximately 100% of original size.)
These lateral recumbent projections have been included to
demonstrate the effectof 
forcedinflation
on
radiographic lung opacity and cardiac shadow.
Although when analysing pulmonary features good
lung lobes, the contrast with forced inflation is so high
that soft tissue shadows of blood vessels, heart and
bronchial walls are less distinct when compared to films in
full inflation. The hyperlucency of the lung lobes require
bright light illumination for full evaluation of all the lung
fields and cardiac outline.
1171
The effect on cardiac shadow is also worthy of note. The
cardiac shadow appears overall smaller in area compared
to the shadow in full inflation. Also, a caudal rotation
occurs changing the cardiac outline to become “upright' in
appearance.This
 rotation  results   in  an increased
dorsoventral measurement, at the maximum cardiac depth.
while decreasing the craniocaudal measurement at the
maximum cardiac width
In addition  the diaphragmatic shadow is flattened,
especially ventrally, making the cupola indistinguishable
as a distinct part of the diaphragmatic shadow.
Radiographic shadows in this cat are normal and the
corresponding ventrodorsal projection of thorax can be
found in Figure 740

Left lateral recumbent projection of thorax. (Corresponds
1175
to original radiograph not included in the book. The
radiograph was taken during general anaesthesia and at full
inflation of lung lobes.) British Domestic Short Haired cat
14 years old, neutered female.
The line drawing corresponds to a radiograph of the
14-year-old cat showing no clinical signs of cardiac
disease which was radiographed as a routine in a study of
feline rhinitis.
Note the cranial rotation of the cardiac shadow despite
fullinflation of lung lobes and correct radiographic
positioning for the thoracic cavity. The rotation has created
an abnormally large craniocaudal measurement for the
cardiac shadow, with increase in stermal contact (1).
In addition the cranial rotation has caused apex (2) to be
dorsally elevated. The latter is not a common feature of a
diseased   heart  resulting
 in left-sided  enlargement.
Left-sided cardiac enlargement more often shows the apex
to be closer to the sternum with an overall increase in
1176
cardiac sternal contact. The horizontal position of the
cardiac shadow is further exaggerated in this film by the
enlarged aortic arch (3).
The cardiac and aortic shadows seen and described in this
aged cat are thought to be normal variations in the
geriatric cat. However, care must be taken to ensure that
cardiac disease is not present. This age group often shows
cardiac  abnormality,  most  commonly  hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. Some older dogs also develop a similar
aortic shadow.
The dorsoventral projection of thorax of this cat did not
show any evidence of left-sided enlargement. A large,
well-defined aortic arch shadow was seen but there was no
unusual curvature of the arch or descending aorta.

The line drawing corresponds to a radiograph of the

Note the aortic arch (1) which appears large. A knob or
knuckle shape (2) is seen at the junction of the arch and
descending aorta; aortic isthmus.
The appearance of the aorta, as above, is thought to be a
normal variation of the aged cat. Some older dogs
develop a similar aortic shadow.
The lateral recumbent projection of thorax of this cat
showed similar changes to the 14-year-old cat (Figure 731)
with respect to the cardiac and aortic shadows. In addition
a radiopaque appearance of the elongated aortic arch at the
level of aortic isthmus was present.

vertebra to caudal 13th thoracic vertebra levels. Such an
appearance is normal in the cat and must not be confused
with lung retraction due to the presence of pleural
effusion.

Although skin folds do not usually create the same false
effect of lung opacity, compared with the dog, it is worth
noting that the extreme cranial, and correct, position of the
forelimbs in this radiograph has causedsome
superimposition of the bony scapulae over the cranial
thoracic cavity. All bony shadows seen in a thoracic
cavity radiograph must be traced to their origin in order
to avoid misdiagnosis. The latter is extremely important
for rib shadows with their associated mineralised costal
cartilages.

years old, neutered female (same cat as in ventrodorsal
projection of thorax, Figure 736). (Approximately 80% of

Original size.
The dorsoventral projection has been included to illustrate
the cardiac shadow and the area of lung exposed when
1191
compared with the ventrodorsal. In the ventrodorsal
projection the atrial/auricular shadows of the cardiac
outline are highlighted. The latter makes the cardiac
shadow appear more *valentine’ in shape (also see Figure
741). The dorsoventral projection gives the thoracic
cavity a shorter, triangular shape rather than the longer
rectangular shape seen in the ventrodorsal.
For  lung shadows the ventrodorsal projection is
preferred. Cranial positioning of the forelimbs is
important for  both the  ventrodorsal  and  dorsoventral
projections as the thorax will appear longer and less
triangular than if the legs are positioned to the sides of the
thorax.
A short, triangular thoracic cavity, and hence reduction
of lung shadow, is greatest in the dorsoventral projection
with the forelegs at the sides of the thorax.

1195
The effect of forced or over-inflation compared to full
inflation was discussed in the left and right lateral
recumbent projection of thorax, Figures 728 and 729.
Considering   the  ventrodorsal   projection    note  the
increased radiolucency of the lung lobes and flattening
of the central and
peripheral
parts of the
diaphragmatic shadow.
Although the cardiac shadow is reduced in area with
forced inflation, evaluation of this shadow can not be
accurately made on any ventrodorsal projection. This is
because the heart rotates craniodorsally creating a space
between the cardiac and diaphragmatic shadows. The
rotation often distorts the position of the cardiac shadow
within the thorax. Also, the curved cranial cardiac
borders may become more prominent. Compare with
Figures 736 and 739 of the same cat in ventrodorsal and
dorsoventral projections.

original size.)
The radiograph shows the opaque linear pattern seen in
the young animal thought to be due to interstitial fluid not
present in adults. The opacity in this cat has considerably
reduced the clarity of the vascular pattern with the aorta
being barely visible.
The cardiac shadow is typically large and rounding of
the borders, especially the cranial, with increase in sternal
contact is evident.
A diffuse soft tissue shadow with a well-defined ventral
margin is seen in the cranial thorax, its caudal border
merging with the cranial cardiac border. This opacity is the
thymus within the ventral mediastinum. Radiographically
the thymic presence is clearly defined in the lateral
projection of thoracic cavity of very young cats.

old, entire male. Right lateral recumbent projection of

The radiograph shows a reduction in lung opacity
compared to 12 weeks of age (see Figure 742) but still a
very fine linear interstitial pattern is present.
The cardiac shadow has changed little in appearance with
the rounded border still being visible
The cranial thymic opacity seen at 12 weeks of age has
almost disappeared. Only an indistinct soft tissue shadow
is evident at the lst and 2nd rib levels.

The radiograph, compared to 24 weeks of age (see Figure
743) now shows pulmonary, ventral mediastinal and
cardiac shadows similar to those of an adult cat.
The lung opacity seen previously at the younger ages has
been lost and lucent shadows of lung tissue replace the
thymic soft tissue opacity at the 1st and 2nd rib levels.
Reduction in the rounding of the cardiac shadow has
given the cranial border a normal contour.

Cats’ kidneys are more variable in their location than
dogs' kidneys. They tend to be more caudoventral and
overlap on the lateral projections. In addition, the most
caudally located kidney is not always left, hence
requiring aventrodorsal or dorsoventral projection for an
accurate kidney analysis. Kidney shape is similar to the
dog but they are smaller in size.
1204
Guidance for normal kidney size
Length of kidney is 2 to 2.5 times the length of the
2nd lumbar vertebral body. It has been reported
that in entire cats the length may be 3 times the
vertebral body. Both kidneys are similar in size.
Kidney   size  best  achieved  in  ventrodorsal
projection.
Kidneys and ureters are retroperitoneal. Ureters are not
visible on plain radiographs.
21 Urinary bladder
21(a) Bladder neck. The cat bladder has a long narrow
neck so that the bladder's radiographic position is 2-3 cm
cranial to the pubis. This is in contrast to the dog where the
position is immediately cranial to the pubis in the female
and cranial to the prostate in the male.
21(b) Urethra located in the fat caudal to the bladder neck
The urethra in the cat is very narrow and usually
requires contrast material to demonstrate its position.
22 Sublumbar muscles.Although the muscles in the cat are

The radiographic shadows are very similar to the
corresponding dorsoventral projection of abdomen in this
cat. Kidney shadows are usually more well defined in
the ventrodorsal projection while the dorsal extremity of
the spleen is less clear.
Gastric and intestinal shadows are virtually unchanged
in these ventrodorsal and dorsoventral projections of the
abdomen. This is due to the absence of recognisable
lumenal gas shifting with alterations of abdominal
positioning.
Please see the differences in the dog ventrodorsal and
dorsoventral projections of abdomen, Figures 484 -489
and 490-495.

(Approximately 80% of original size.)
The gastric shadow shows gross distension of the gastric
lumen with recent ingesta. Notice how large the cat's
stomach can stretch without clinical signs of dilation. The
degree of distension has caused displacement of the
ventral extremity of the spleen making it appear more
elongated and readily visible. In lateral recumbencies the
ventral extremity of the spleen is often not seen (see
Figures 745 and 747).

(Approximately 90% of original size.)
The gastric shadow is grossly distended with recent
ingesta. The degree of lumenal distension has displaced
1224
the caudal body and pyloric parts of the stomach to the
right side of the abdomen.
When the stomach is empty or moderately filled the body
usually lies to the left and the pyloric parts lie in the
midline of the abdomen. This radiograph demonstrates the
changes brought about by normal gastric distension in
the cat. Gastric enlargement has resulted in the splenic
shadow being obscured at the ventral extremity but the
dorsal extremity is highlighted.
The descending colon can be seen on the left side of the
abdomen which is the more frequent anatomical position
in both the dog and cat.
Loss of abdominal fat: Figure 756

(Approximately 90% of original size.)
1225
The radiograph shows gross loss of a well-defined inner
surface of abdominal wall, serosal surface of bowel and
organ soft tissue shadows such as liver, kidneys and
bladder. Abdominal shadows are limited to gas-filled
structures  surrounded by  a homogeneous  soft tissue
opacity. The appearance is due to excessive loss of the
grey opacity fat tissue, in this case secondary to
hyperthyroidism. Identification of different soft tissue
shadows within the abdomen is only possible in the
presence of fat tissue and hence fat is vital for abdominal
contrast.
The reduction in abdominal contrast seen in this
radiograph must not be mistaken for free abdominal
fluid. The latter also causes a loss of contrast as the fluid
has the same radiographic opacity as soft tissue.
Differentiation from free abdominal fluid or ascites is
aided by the long shallow appearance of the abdomen
together with the absence of subcutaneous fat.

The film demonstrates how, in an obese cat, the small
intestinal loops become confined to the mid-ventral
abdomen, apparently bunched together
Large deposits of abdominal fat are seen as grey
opacities and serosal surfaces of abdominal organs are
well defined. The inner surface of the abdominal wall is
seen as a separate shadow and subcutaneously the
inguinal region has a pendulous appearance due to
massive fat deposits.

gastrointestinal tract. Comprises, routinely, serial lateral
recumbent and ventrodorsal radiographs of the abdomen
1233
and shows the appearance of liquid barium sulphate
passing through the gastrointestinal tract over a period of
up to 24 hours.
Restraint is by positioning aids, e.g. sandbags, and
sedation where necessary.
Note that the appearance of the stomach can vary with
species and dog breed conformation, the degree of
distension and the ratio of fluid to gas. The distribution of
fluid and gas depends on the radiographic projection being
used.
Also, the gastric emptying and general transit times
through the bowel can vary considerably according to the
temperament of the animal, the type of any chemical
restraint used, and whether there is residual ingesta in the
tract.
Barium impregnated polyethylene spheres (BIPS)
provide an alternative to liquid barium in the investigation
of suspected motility problems or blockages. They do not
give any information about the nature of the
gastrointestinal walls or mucosal linings. (See Figures 836
and 837, BIPs in the cat, 6 and 32 hours after oral
administration.)

The normal striped appearance of barium in the
longitudinal mucosal folds of the oesophageal wall is
seen, together with the dorsal elevation of oesophageal
shadow at the 4th intercostal space level over the base of
the heart (dorsal to the circular radiolucent shadow of the
left cranial lobe, caudal part, bronchus).
A
 repeat  radiograph,  approximately  10
minutes
post-administration of the liquid barium, should reveal no
traces of barium in the normal oesophagus.

German Pointer dog 7 years old, entire male.
Accidental inhalation of the contrast material is shown.
Cranially the tracheal lumen is outlined, and more
caudally the contrast has entered the right caudal lobe
bronchus. The contrast has gravitated into the smaller
1262
bronchioles and traces of this usually remain within the
lung tissue for many years.
It is worth noting that compared with Figure 778, which
shows contrast in the normal oesophagus, the deviation at
4th intercostal space level is a ventral dipping rather than a
dorsal elevation. This anomaly has been caused by
positional rotation of the thorax resulting in a “loss' of the
normal dorsal elevation of the oesophagus at the left
cranial lung lobe, caudal part, bronchus.
Incidental findings are shot gun pellets (arrows).

Small out-pouchings (arrows) of the barium column in
the descending duodenum may sometimes be seen. They
1265
are termed 'pseudoulcers' and occur where the mucosa
thins out over submucosal lymph follicles. They should not
be confused with pathological ulcers.
A finely villous appearance of the mucosal surface,
varying in extent along the small intestine, may also be
evident. This is called fimbriation and is generally
considered to be due to barium separating individual
mucosal villi. Other factors are also involved. Fimbriation
is reduced with increased bowel distension but mucus,
clumping of villi and regional differences in mucosal
movement all play a part.
Differentiation of normal fimbriation from diseased
mucosa must be made by studying other radiographic signs
and clinical history. Here the whole of the duodenal
mucosal surface is involved.

In the stomach contrast medium pools in the dependent
areas with any gas rising to the highest part of the lumen
according to the position of the patient. Thus in the right
lateral recumbency (see Figure 766) the pyloric antrum
becomes contrast filled, with gas appearing in the fundus.
Conversely in the left lateral recumbency, as illustrated
here, the contrast settles in the fundus and gas collects in
1267
the pyloric antrum. Arrows indicate 'pseudoulcers' in the
descending duodenum.

Pyelogram phase of IVU
The renal pelves and the pelvic recesses are outlined.
Tracing, and identifying separately, the individual ureters
along their length can be particularly difficult in the lateral
projection because of the effects of peristalsis and
superimposition. The right ureter is marked with thin
arrows while the left ureter is labelled with thick arrows.
1286
Normal peristaltic contractions causing segmental gaps
within the contrast columns of the ureters are indicated
by the curved arrows.
Contrast medium is already appearing in the urinary
bladder. The open arrow indicates a ureterovesical
junction of one of the ureters, more likely left from the
ventral
position, but this
requires 
confirmation.
Ureterovesical junctions are more likely to be seen in this
projection than in the ventrodorsal where the pelvis
overlies. Clarity has been enhanced by the use of the
pneumocystography.

A nipple may be large enough to resemble, on an X-ray, a

pneumocystogram, a luminal filling defect in the bladder
(thin arrow). However a similar, circumscribed soft tissue
opacity is visible (thick arrow), symmetrically, on the left
side of the abdomen. The opacity is located over the
descending colon, strongly suggesting that the “filling
defect' is one of a pair of nipples.

(Approximately 70% of original size.)
Radiography is performed immediately after filling the
urethra with the contrast media via a catheter whose tip is
lodged in the distal urethral lumen. Distension of the
lumen, particularly that of the prostatic portion of the
urethra, is aided by a full bladder. An apparently narrow
prostatic portion is not necessarily  abnormal  and
contrast may show as longitudinal streaks within the
folds of the lining mucous membrane.
In this radiograph some of the contrast medium has passed
into the bladder. The prostatic portion (l) of the pelvic
urethra is not so distended as the caudal portion (2).
1300
Although in many males the prostatic urethra shows a
regional widening of the lumen.
Small amounts of contrast media may enter the normal
prostatic ductules.

Radiographs are taken after filling the vagina, or vestibule,
vagina and urethra, with water-soluble contrast medium
via a catheter whose tip is lodged at the vaginovestibular
junction, or just within the vestibule. The length and the
diameter of the vagina vary with the body size and breed
of the subject as well as the hormonal status.
The caudal, or plicate, intrapelvic section has longitudinal
folds and is easily distended, the folds smoothing out.
The cranial, or paracervical, intra-abdominal section much
more restricted with a “U'-shaped lumen and one fold
always present, the dorsomedian fold, lying caudal to the
vaginal cervix.
With only a small amount of contrast the cranial vagina
may show simply as a fine horizontal line, whereas more
complete    filling
willdefine, caudally，the
crescent-shaped lower border of the dorsomedian fold
and, cranially, the protrusion of the cervix into the
vagina.

The subarachnoid space is at its widest through the 1st
and 2nd cervical vertebrae. The ventral column of
contrast not infrequently bends slightly dorsally, as well
as narrowing, at the 2nd to 3rd cervical intervertebral
disc space. Slight narrowing of the ventral column with
minor indentations may also occur over each of the
The spinal cord is at its widest in the lower cervical
region where it gives rise to the nerves of the brachial
plexus. Through the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae the
ventral column often appears raised from the floor of the
canal.
1311
The use of a tilting table for this contrast technique enables
positioning of the head and neck at an angle of 5 to 10
degrees from the horizontal in a dorsocranial-ventrocaudal
direction, which encourages the caudal flow of the contrast
medium along the subarachnoid space. In the absence of
such a table temporarily placing the animal in sternal
recumbency with the head moderately elevated has a
similar effect.

There is a gradual redistribution of the contrast in the
caudal thoracic subarachnoid space resulting in a
well-filled dorsal column and a thinner ventral column
Considerable tilting of the long axis of the spine in a

case to further the flow of contrast medium beyond the
caudal cervical region.

In the caudal thoracic region the dorsal column of
contrast is much wider than the ventral. Through the
cranial lumbar vertebrae the ventral column increases
again in width. From the 4th lumbar vertebra the
columns begin to converge as the spinal cord tapers into
the cauda equina. Radiolucent linear filling defects
obliquely crossing the cord at the 4th lumbar vertebra are
caused by the emerging spinal nerve roots and confirm the
subarachnoid distribution of the contrast medium
Shallow undulations of the ventral column, lifting over
the intervertebral spaces, are frequently seen in the
lumbar region, occasionally with a slight break in the
contrast.
Some widening of the cord at the 4th and 5th lumbar
vertebrae, the origin of the nerves of the sacral plexus, may
be apparent.

Caudal to the base of the heart longitudinal striations, up
to this point similar to the dog, give way to a “herring
bone’ pattern reflecting the obliquely directed folds of
mucosa. The latter corresponds to the change to smooth
muscle in the wall of this segment of the cat'soesophagus.

(Approximately 160% of original size.)
A volume of barium is present within the distal
oesophageal lumen, due to the immediate reflux of
barium from the gastric fundus into the oesophagus. Such
a reflux is sometimes seen in both the cat and the dog. It is
not considered clinically significant unless the reflux is
prolonged   and/or   the    oesophageal  shadow   shows
abnormality.

Short but strong segmental peristalsis may occur along the
proximal duodenum, resulting in regularly spaced, rather
globular expansions, *beads', of the barium column.
1343
Linear filling defects within the intervening contracted
segments represent mucosal folds indenting the narrowed
bowel lumen and are described as ‘pseudostringing
Note that the contracted portions of the bowel are
symmetrically central to the expanded portions, in
comparison with the asymmetric pattern seen in the
presence of a linear foreign body.
A roundworm is highlighted by the contrast in the
descending portion of the duodenum.

Both sized spheres can be seen, grouped together, within

no evidence of luminal spheres.

(Approximately 70% of original size.)
All the spheres have travelled to the descending colon
Figures 836 and 837 Barium impregnated polyethylene
spheres (BIPS). BIPS are supplied in two different sizes
of gelatin capsules (small-cap and large-cap option), each
containing a mixture of large and small spheres. The
capsules are given orally, with or without food, according
to the investigation being carried out.
The primary function of the large BIPS is the detection of
gastrointestinal tract obstructions. Small BIPS mimic the
passage of food. Their passage through the gastrointestinal
tract provides a relatively accurate estimation of the
gastric emptying rate and intestinal transit time of food.
