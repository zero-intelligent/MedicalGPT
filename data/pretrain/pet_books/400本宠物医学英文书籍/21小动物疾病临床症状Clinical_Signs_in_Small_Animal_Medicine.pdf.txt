lntroduction
You might look at this book and wonder what motivated me to do a picture atlas of small animal
medicine in light of all the science that constantly embraces us in the modern veterinary literature
My answers are simple. The main reason is that there is no substitute for looking at the animal and
observing its lesion or abnormal movement when it comes to making a clinical diagnosis. It is this
philosophy that I was taught by my mentors at the Animal Medical Center (AMC) in New York City in
the 1970s, and it is stillthe way I continue to teach my students up to the present day. The other
important reason is that I wanted to leave a meaningful legacy to this profession and, with so many
wonderful textbooks being published, I wanted the images in this book to complement the written
words of my colleagues
Western man's revision of the ancient Chinese proverb A picture is worth ten thousand words'
became One look is worth a thousand words', as contributed by Fred R. Barnard in the advertising
rade journal Printers'Ink in 1921. In 1927 Barnard republished this in an advertisement as 'One
picture is worth ten thousand words'. Regardless of the origin and subsequent modifications, the value
 Of actually seeing the lesion is especially valuable and irreplaceable in the learning of medicine,
whether it be worth one thousand or ten thousand words
As stated above, one of the main objectives for doing this text is to provide a graphic
representation of disorders that many clinicians will encounter in their practice of medicine. This
desire first dawned on me during my internship at the AMC in 1970, at which time my salary was
$6,500 and the unbelievably large case load made me forget that I was starving. There was no way for
me to buy the camera with a macro' lens that my more senior colleagues were using. So, with great
frustration I had to wait for my residency in medicine, at which time I was able to borrow the cost of a
new Nikon Nikormat' camera with its very special macrolens, which was subsequently paid back with
$35.00 taken from each paycheck. From that moment on my camera accompanied me at my patients?
cage side', where I recorded images that would hopefully some day enhance my real desire to teach
clinical medicine.
The images selected for this book are amongst the many thousands in my collection. They have
been selected because of the unique clinical situations they represent. At times the reader will find that
I have presented more than one version of a particular clinical sign; this has been done in order to
show that many syndromes can have several different presentations. What compelled me to show one
of certain conditions; however, the reader will find exceptions to this discretionary guideline, where
some conditions might not be so rare.
I tried initially to represent most organ systems and keep the images distributed evenly amongst
E Aid aogououa pue aroornuaose se yns suaisas ueio ip mes uoos I raaamo  
   e i     sn s n      s
various systems. At first I envisioned a book that would provide pictures of just about every topic
covered in textbooks such as Ettinger and Feldman's Veterinary Internal Medicine, but the size of
such a book would be just too unmanageable and probably too costly. So, perhaps the topics not
illustrated will motivate me to publish a 2nd edition in the future.
The organization of this text is purely to emphasize the imagery of medicine. From the very first
moment we walk into the client waiting room and the examination room, our eyes immediately fixate
on the patient after first greeting the pet owner. This is the beginning of our examination and this is
where a picture is definitely worth a thousand or even ten thousand words'. Of course we should
always be careful not to fixate on the lesion and forget about the rest of the patient. One way of
avoiding this medical pitfall is to focus on the problem only after first thoroughly examining the
patient. While mentioning the word pitfall, this might be the best place to share with you some
philosophical thoughts that I have written down over my 37 years of practicing veterinary medicine.
Some might seem rather light-hearted, but others are strong warnings of potential disasters that await
us all. The first list comes from my early experiences with Dr. Erwin Small at the University of Illinois,
where I received my degree in veterinary medicine, and then at the AMC, where I had the great honor
Of being taught by men such as Drs. William J. Kay and Steven Ettinger. I assure you I was influenced
by many more than just these three colleagues, but they are the ones who informed me and energized
me like nothing else in this world. The title Mikey's Maxims’ comes from a term of endearment that
was bestowed upon me in New York by one of my interns, Dr. Max Easom, and which has stuck to
me for many years. So, here are Mikey's Maxims':
← Treat for the treatable.
 Assumptions lead to trouble; therefore don't assume.
← Always interpret clinical information within the context of the patient's presentation.
← Avoid tunnel vision.
+Treat your patient, not just its disease.
← Avoid overmedicating.
← Be honest with yourself.
← Don't postpone today's urgencies until tomorrow.
← Think that common things occur commonly.
 Look closely at your patient; it will usually telyou what's wrong.
← Never let your patient die without the benefit of the silver bullet.
→When you hear hoofbeats, look for horses, but don't forget about the zebras.
← Never sell the basics short -- they are still the best buy in town
← If you don't think it, you won't find it
← Never let a biological specimen go to waste.
← Disaster lurks whenever a patient's problem is routine'.
+ If it's not getting worse, give it a chance to get better.
 Don't stray too far from the patient - the diagnosis will appear eventually.
→ Don't give your patient a disease it doesn't deserve to have.
← Don't let technology make you decerebrate.
← The necropsy is the clinician's trial by jury.
← The wisdom of experience should never be ignored.
 The diagnostician should always ask him/herself these two questions: where am I now, and where
am I going?
→ In order to successfully to treat a cat, you must think like a cat.
 Avoid the pitfalls of the red herring.
+ If they can't afford a Caddy, then offer them a Chevy
← Know thy patient.
+ Nobody wants to pay for a big bil and a dead animal.
→ You must have cognition to be a competent diagnostician
→ To prognose, you must first be able to diagnose
Funny as some of these might seem, I promise that each and every one is based on real life
experiences and, by offering these to you, I hope that I can spare you a fraction of the pain' that
I have experienced over the years.
About 8-10 years ago I developed a lecture titled “Clinical Pearls'. Unlike the Maxims, which are
more philosophical, the Clinical Pearls’ represent valuable lessons in actual practice that have helped
me and others to practice better medicine. I never intended for these to be included in this image
textbook, but the publisher, Mr. Michael Manson, insisted that they be included in this text. So, bowing
to Mike's knowledge and experience with the written word, I have included various lists of “Clinical
Pearls', which, again, I hope will be of great benefit to my fellow practitioners. Some are general in
nature and are shown at the end of this Introduction; others are shown at the beginning of the chapter
to which they relate. Some of these are written with American slang, which is essential for the maximal
effect of my message. I offer my apology to those who might be overly critical of my absence of style.
There are so many people that I want to thank, without whom much of my career would not have
been possible. First and foremost is my wife, M.J. (Mary Jane), who has been my faithful companion
through thick and thin over the past 33 years of our marriage. Special credit is deserved because living
with me under periods of extreme work pressure will never be described as a ^cake-walk'. M.J. is
actually the main person who made this book possible because she single-handedly and painstakingly
scanned thousands of my slides to allow for me to enter the electronic age of teaching. I might add
that she just did not scan aimlessly; instead she took each slide, cleaned it from its years of wear and
tear and made it completely usable for the many years to come. Such saintly patience I could never
have, or I probably would have been a brain surgeon instead of an internist! On the home front
I thank my children, Andrew and Lauren, for hanging in there with their Dad even though he missed
some of the special moments of their childhood, and then back to M.J, who made certain that my
work must wait while the Dad was where he was supposed to be for most of those special events.
To my parents, Teddy (deceased) and Bernice, I thank you for teaching me the principles of right
and wrong and for providing me with the best college education possible. To my late sister, Marsha,
thank you for always sharing in my triumphs and being there when I needed a friend. You left us too
suddenly. I miss you.
To my students, I leave my works hopefully for you to benefit from, because it was you who
inspired me to keep on with my teaching when everything else around me seemed rather dismal.
Remembering those moments of discovery during rounds still brings out the goose bumps, and those
looks on your faces when you realized that you could actually practice excellent medicine - priceless.
A special thank you to my colleagues who shared in those moments of learning and who offered
me their own excellent wisdom and inspiration in my search of excellence in medicine. Academic
medicine is far from a relaxing environment, but at the same time it is the only place where intellectual
challenges are made, egos are bruised, and, most importantly, where the art and science of medicine
progresses. I only hope that we share mutually in those special moments. I also want to acknowledge
my colleagues at the AMC and the University of Florida for allowing me to photograph their cases and
to share them with my students, colleagues and the readers of this text.
Last and certainly not least I want to thank Mr. Michael Manson and his wonderful staff at
Manson Publishing, located in London, England. What a tremendously gracious gentleman Mike is
and what a wonderful intellect he has, which has made him the success that he is today. My final
acknowledgment goes to Peter Beynon, who is responsible for converting my rough literary style into
one that gives me more credit than I deserve. Thank you, Peter, for doing your 'magic' to make this
book the polished finished product that we now have in our hands

CLINICAL PEARLS
Patient evaluation:
→Pallor can be caused by hypoxia, shock, anemia, and an epinephrine injection.
→ Anemic pallor plus icterus causes a yellow hue.
◆ Pink mucous membranes plus icterus causes a more orange color.
← Massive generalized lymphadenopathy usually means lymphoma.
← If it looks, smells, and tastes (?) like pus, then it must be pus.
← Chest plus abdominal fluid accumulation commonly depicts a bad disease. Common causes:
neoplasia, heart failure, diffuse inflammation, hypoproteinemia.
←Septic shock: hypotension, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia
← Skin turgor is difficult to assess with cachexia and obesity.
← Sudden facial swelling, hemorrhagic oral mucosa, subdued mentation - think Eastern diamondback
rattlesnake envenomation (in Florida).
Various causes of hyperventilation: cardiorespiratory, pyrexia, brain disease, Cushing's, metabolic
acidosis, anxiety, pain, shock, anemia.
← Fever plus immune-mediated disease - appetite can persist.
+ Fever plus sepsis - anorexia.
← Nasal crustiness, scleral injection, muddy mucous membranes - think uremia.
+ On palpation: Touch but don't squeeze the Charmin'.
← Take the patient out of the cage and look at it!
+ If something is just ain't right', think neuro.
← Look under that tongue in any vomiting cat (and dog).
+Watch those hindlimbs for the earliest sign of weakness.
← The big 6: PCV, TP, BUN, glucose, urine analysis, chest/abdominal radiographs.
 After therapeutic pericentesis, go back and repeat abdominal palpation so you don't pass the mass.
+ Have you been palpating each mammary gland?
← A lump is a lump until you stick it.
+ It's all in the history.
→ Don't just look at it (a lump) - stick it!
→ Heat stroke >43°C (>109.4*F) - look out for DIC
Fluids and electrolytes:
← SC fluid administration - isotonic, 18 gauge needle, gravity flow.
 Metabolic alkalosis plus hypokalemia common with upper GI obstructions.
← 0.9% NaCl plus KCl - best for upper GI obstructions.
← TCO, >40 mmol/l is always metabolic alkalosis (usually with hypokalemia).
Introduction
← TCO, < 10 mmol/l usually means severe metabolic acidosis.
← Potassium penicillin contains 1.7 mmol K+ /million units - take heed when bolusing.
← Treatment for hypocalcemia when IV not an option: add 2.5 ml/kg 10% calcium gluconate to 150
ml 0.9% NaCl - give SC q12h (for adult sized cat).
← When giving SC fluids avoid hypokalemia - add 3.5 mmol KCl/150 ml lactated Ringer's solution -
give SC (for adult sized cat).
←  All IV maintenance fluids should contain 7-10 mmol KCl/250 ml; exceptions are oliguria and
untreated Addisonian.
 To make up 2.5% dextrose solution increments, add 12.5 ml of 50% dextrose in water to 250 ml of
fluids.
← Rehydrate before inducing diuresis; check urine SG first.
←Volume load with isotonic crystalloid.
 Intraosseous cannulas can be life saving.
Drugs:
← Observe for drug interactions.
← Do not use theophylline with ciprofloxacin -- causes theophylline OD.
← Best avoid IV route for thiamine (better IM) and vitamin K1 (better SC)
 Rehydrate prior to using aminoglycosides.
← Prednisone for craniomandibular osteopathy.
←Cimetidine enhances metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity
← Aspiration pneumonia worse when H, blockers in use.
← Panmycin in cats can cause fevers.
 For anaphylaxis give epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg) IM and repeat every 15-20 minutes until stable.
Patient management:
+ Old dogs are poorly tolerant to tranquilization.
 Avoid sedating acutely ill patients unless absolutely necessary.
← Don't sedate at the end of the day.
 Increased spontaneity might preempt death.
Heparinized syringe might contain as much as 200 units heparin - too much for puppies and
kittens.
← Traumatic ear flush can cause inner ear and vestibular disease.
→Cats hate atropine drops (use ointment instead).
← Some pathologic bladders can leak after cystocentesis.
← Do not forget thiamine in cats.
 Glycerine suppositories for patients with pelvic fractures will be most appreciated!
10
←Three milligrams (total dose) ketamine IV - can adequately restrain the sick cat with urethral
obstruction.
← Careful with SC fluids - dogs are not cats, and they like to slough!
Manual expression of a male dogs bladder is hazardous to its health - it can rupture.
←SC fluid administration - stay behind the scapula and in front of the wing of the ilium. Use 18
 gauge needle and 50 ml/site (adult cat).
+Don't forget glucose for the babies.
← Imipenem for life-threatening infections.
←A clean cat is a happy cat.
← No Fleet enemas (high phosphate, high sodium-containing enema solution) for obstipation, unless
you want to treat a good case of hypocalcemia.
 When is the last time you hugged your patients?
+ A dynamic duo: good science and experience.
← Heat lamp and rubbing alcohol = one hot dog.
★ Nothing is routine.
← Body bandage in cats cause pseudoparalysis.
 Rapid abdominocentesis is effective and safe for chronic ascites, except when it is due to liver disease.
With the latter it is best to go slower and simultaneously administer IV plasma.
→ Best avoid IV B1 and K1 - give SC or IM.
+ Never kill'em' based on cytology results.
← Treat anaphylaxis eith epinephrine, IV fluids, H, and H, blockers, and glucocorticoids
(for delayed benefit).

Introduction
Dermatologic
disorders
DERMATOLOGY is derived from the Greek term derma, meaning skin, and
logos, meaning study or speech, word, or reason. It is an essential discipline for
the practitioner because of the high incidence of skin disease that one can
encounter daily in practice. These disorders can occur as primary lesions or
syndromes or they can be a reflection of some other internal disease process
in the body. Adherence to the essentials of obtaining a complete history and
doing a complete physical examination will be most helpful in determining the
cause of the dermatologic disorder. Perhaps the most common group of skin
diseases involve hypersensitivity states, but other important conditions might
be associated with autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, neoplasia,
nutritional disorders, and various metabolic and endocrine conditions. The
diagnostic methodology of skin diseases, after taking a complete history and
conducting a physical examination, includes general tests such as a complete
blood count, serum biochemistry profile, immune or infectious disease
serology, skin hypersensitivity testing, and biopsy. The advantage of these
tests is that they are readily available to the practitioner and noninvasive for
allow for a minimal diagnostic evaluation, thus saving the owner a substantial
amount of expense.
 Eosinophilic granuloma complex in a cat.
Dermatologic disorders
← A lump is a lump until you look at it under the microscope.
+ Don't look at it - stick it.
← Skin turgor difficult to assess with obesity and cachexia.
← Excessive SQ fluids can cause sloughed tissue.
 Puppy strangles. Otherwise
known as juvenile cellulitis, this 
 condition affects puppies four
weeks to four months of age.
Antibiotic drugs are virtually
ineffective in controlling this
condition; glucococorticoids
are the drug of choice for this
presumed hypersensitivity
 skin condition.
2  Alopecia X.
This Pomeranian has the typical
skin abnormalities of alopecia
and hyperpigmentation that was
once blamed on growth
hormone deficiency. Further
research has shown that growth
hormone blood levels can be
normal in many of these dogs,
and that the syndrome can be
 associated with various other
 causes including sex
hormone abnormalities.
14
Dermatologic disorders
3a-c  Cheyletiella mange.
3a
Examination of this very
pruritic rabbit (3a) revealed
*walking dandruff’ (3b, c),
which was actually the moving
mites. This condition is easily
diagnosed, with a microscopic
examination of a skin scraping
sample showing the large mite.
 Pyrethrin powder can be used to
treat this parasite, but do not
use permethrins because of the
adverse side-effects that can
 occur in rabbits and cats with
these compounds.
3b
3c
Dermatologic disorders
4a, b Calcinosis cutis.
4a
This dog (4a) had pituitary-
 induced hyperadrenocorticism
(PDH) and the characteristic
inflammatory form of
calcinosis cutis. Note the
mineralization in the
close-up view of the axilla (4b).
 Despite the inflammation,
glucocorticoid drugs should not
be used because these drugs
will only worsen the condition.
4b
5a, b  Calcinosis cutis from
5a
calcium gluconate.
These two images show severe
debilitating calcinosis cutis
caused by a calcium gluconate
injection that was given sub-
cutaneously to a young
Australian Shepherd Dog to
treat its hypocalcemia, which
was caused by primary
hypoparathyroidism. Image 5a
was taken during the early phase
of the condition, and image 5b
was taken 1 week later. Despite
what the veterinary literature
states, calcium gluconate
solution is irritating to tissues
16
and should, therefore, be
injected into a large vein.
Dermatologicdisorders
5b
6a, b Angioneurotic edema.
 This young Dachshund
acquired angioneurotic edema
 and urticaria shortly after being
vaccinated. This is a type 1
hypersensitivity reaction that
responds to antihistamine and
 glucocorticoid therapy, and
time. It usually does not
progress to more life-
threatening signs, but the
patient should best be
examined anyway.
6b
Dermatologic disorders
7a, b Cuterebriasis.
7a
 Cuterebra species flies will
 sometimes deposit their eggs
directly onto a dog's skin, which
allows the larvae to burrow into
the skin and cause the typical
 granuloma-containing blow-
holes' (7a). This larva was
 carefully extracted, at the
same being cautious not to
crush it while it was in the
skin (7b). Also described in case
408.
7b
8 Contact dermatitis.
This Abyssinian cat sat in
kerosene and acquired acute
contact dermatitis.
The cat's frequent licking
worsened the inflammation.
Antinflammatory drugs and
the use of an Elizabethan
collar would be indicated
for treatment.
18
Dermatologic disorders
9a, b Fire ant bites.
9a
This young Weimeraner laid
down next to a fire ant nest and
was swarmed by these wingless,
stinging hymenopterans (9a).
The lesions are papular at first
 and then develop a central
 suppurative core, which is
evident by the 'white heads'
(9b). Treatment consists of ant
removal, antihistamine and
glucocorticoid drugs, and good
general patient care.
Intravenous fluids might be
 necessary; antibiotic use is
discretionary (also described in
case 393, p. 282).
9b
10 Kerion.
10
This focal dermatophyte
lesion on the tail of a dog
has a granulomatous character.
It is usually caused by
Microsporum gypseum and is
most often located on the face
and limbs. Diagnosis and
treatment are the same as for
 any other der matophyte
infection. Treatment includes
clipping the area and topical
 and oral antifungal drugs.
19
Dermatologic disorders
11a, b Linear granuloma.
11a
 A compulsive licking disorder
might be a strong factor toward
the development of this cat's
bilateral skin condition.
 Treatment entails the cessation 
 of any particular triggers that
might stress the cat, in
addition to drugs used for
behavior modification.
11b
12 Sepsis.
12
 These dark pigmented skin
lesions were associated with
Pseudomonas species
bacteremia that involved the
end arterioles of the skin blood
vessels as well as other major
 organ systems. Microscopic
 evaluation of the skin lesion
demonstrated the
infecting organisms.
20
Dermatologic disorders
13a, b Toxic epidermal
13a
necrolysis.
This is a young Shi Tzu with
severe epidermal ulcerations
and skin slough characteristic of
 toxic epider mal necrolysis
(TEN). It usually occurs 
 following some viral disease or
it can be a complicated adverse
drug reaction. Treatment
 requires discontinuing any
 suspected drug and
 commencing meticulous
patient care, which might
involve medicated dips,
 judicious debridement, and,
sometimes, antimicrobial
treatment for any secondary
 bacterial infection.
13b
Dermatologic disorders
14a, b Hyperelastosis cutis.
14a
This kitten has a congenital
 collagen disorder that has
 caused hyperelastic skin (14a),
which can easily tear with
routine venipuncture (14b).
 Such affected cats require
 repeated wound repair, which
can be quite difficult because
the actual suture needle
insertion can cause
further tears.
14b
15
15
Dermatophytosis.
Ringworm in the cat has a
variety of clinical features. This
particular cat showed signs of
inflammation in addition to the
dry alopecia type of skin lesion.
Microsporum canis is the
common causative agent in
the cat.
22
Dermatologic disorders
16 Pythiosis.
16
Once thought of as a fungal
 Organism, this algae-like
infection is more common in
the dog than the cat. It can be
cutaneous or systemic, with
each form having a guarded to
 grave prognosis. Shown here is
involvement of the pectoral
skin area. Radical surgical
removal of the involved body
part is often necessary before
the lesion becomes too big
to resect.
17a, b Pythiosis.
17a
This dog has a more severe
form of pythiosis that involves
its posterior thigh (17a) and the
ventral venous tributaries (17b).
 It had invaded the deep
pudendal blood vessels,
thus making complete
resection impossible.
17b
23
Dermatologic disorders
18a, b Nodular panniculitis.
18a
The nodular draining skin
lesions in this English Setter
characterize the immune-
mediated skin disorder, nodular
panniculitis. The fluid draining 
from the lesions is opalescent
and contains fat droplets. Fever
and malaise commonly occur.
 The condition is responsive to
glucococorticoid treatment,
which might have to be
maintained at low doses for a
protracted period of time
(2-9 months).
18b
19  Rhodococcus species
19
infection.
This bacterial infection is
common in horses. Cats that
share common environments
with horses can also acquire this
ulcerative draining skin
 infection, which can be
 confused with atypical
 mycobacterial infection. This
 particular infection responded
well to azithromycin
 antimicrobial treatment.
24
Dermatologic disorders
 20a-c  Pemphigus vulgaris.
20a
This Dachshund has
pemphigus vulgaris, one of the
 autoimmune bullus-forming
skin disorders. Typical are the
mucocutaneous ulcerations,
 acanthocytes on a skin scraping,
 and a positive indirect
immunofluorescent antibody
test result. A guarded prognosis
 accompanies the large doses of
required immunosuppressive
treatment.
20b
20c
25
Dermatologic disorders
21a
 21a-c Eosinophilic
granuloma complex.
The cat in 21a and 21b has
 three different lesions involving
the chin, palate, and tongue.
The cat in 21c has a solitary
 lesion on its chin. The exact
 cause is still unknown;
treatment options are
 described in case 23.
21b
21c
Dermatologic disorders
2a-c Eosinophilic
22a
granuloma complex.
This syndrome causes various
types of lesions in the cat.
Shown are a granuloma on the
tongue (22a), an ulcer form
 involving the lip (22b), and a
plaque form involving the
caudal thigh (22c).
22b
22c
 23  Eosinophilic granuloma
23
complex.
This cat shows extensive lip
involvement. Treatments vary
amongst glucocorticoids and
 other immune-modulating
drugs, diet change, antibiotics,
alpha interferon, and
 megestrol acetate (no longer
recommended). The etiology is
still unknown.
27
Dermatologic disorders
24a
24a, b Urticaria in
Schnauzers.
 Urticaria (hives) is commonly
caused by a hypersensitivity
reaction accompanied by
 pruritis. Some Schnauzer dogs
 are predisposed to this lesion,
but the cause is not
always evident.
24b
28
Dermatologic disorders
25a, b Scabies.
25a
 Sarcoptic mange is a common
cause of intense pruritis in 
 dogs. This Beagle puppy has a
characteristic ear itch reflex on
 tactile stimulation (25a) and
papular dermatitis (25b). A
deep skin scraping can
demonstrate the mite and/
 Or its eggs. Sometimes this
discovery requires several
 repeated attempts.
25b
29
Dermatologic disorders
Ophthalmologic
disorders
OPHTHALMOLOGY is derived from the Greek word opbtbalmos, which
refers to the eye. Disorders of the eye occur as primary entities or they can
be manifestations of some other disease elsewhere in the body. The eye is
sometimes referred to as the 'window to the body', because it allows a
direct visualization of pathology that might have its origin elsewhere in the
body. The clinician should have a basic understanding of diseases of the
anterior and posterior segments of the eye and a basic understanding of
direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy. The lesions identified might very well
be the first step to obtaining an expedient and accurate diagnosis. Some of
the images found in this section would not have been possible without the
gracious assistance of the ophthalmology section at the University of
Florida, College of Veterinary Medicine.

This serious ocular disorder can
occur as a primary disease or it
can be only one sign of another
disorder, including various
infectious, autoimmune, and
neoplastic diseases. The
German Shepherd Dog shown
demonstrates the classic
"hepatitis blue eye′ that

30
Cataract.
30
This cataract in a diabetic dog
would typically form rapidly.
Diabetic cataracts usually occur
 in bilaterally. They rarely, if ever,
 occur cats because of their
 more efficient glucokinase
enzyme system, thus preventing
the polyol (sorbital) pathway
 from becoming activated in
the lens.
31  Chorioretinitis.
31
These retinal granulomas
belong to a cat infected with
cryptococcosis. Chorioretinitis
in the cat can also be caused by
several different medical
disorders, including various
fungal infections,
toxoplasmosis, and feline
infectious peritonitis.
 32  Corneal ulcer perforation.
32
The unfortunate progression of
 events in this kitten were upper
respiratory virus infection,
 conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal 
ulcer, and then perforation. The
left eye would probably require
enucleation; the right eye might
 require the same in the future
as well.

 36  Hypermacroglobulinemia.
36
 This paraproteinemia can cause
 blood hyperviscosity and
 coagulation abnormalities. The
accompanying retinal changes
include segmented 'sausage-
shaped' blood vessels and
retinal hemorrhages. Lethargy
is a common clinical complaint
because of the sluggish blood
flow to the brain.
37  Keratic precipitates.

 area and interfered with the
 sympathetic nerve fibers (rami
communicantes) alongside the
anterior thoracic vertebrae, thus
causing a Horner's syndrome
(miosis, ptosis, and
enophthalmos). An affected cat
with a right-sided Horner's
syndrome is shown (47a),
together with a ventrodorsal

INFECTIOUs is derived from the Latin word fectus, meaning corrupt or
infect. This group of disorders is a constant challenge to the clinician,
because a timely diagnosis can often bring about a timely treatment, which
diseases of the dog and cat, but only a small portion will be illustrated in this
section. Although the physical characteristics of certain infections are highly
supportive diagnostic tests such a culture and sensitivity, biopsy, and
serology be used to confirm any clinical suspicions. With the widespread
availability of today's modern day transportation modalities, a thorough
geographic and environmental history is an essential component in the
accurate diagnosis of many of the disorders that follow.

48 Anal sac abscess: cat.
48
Although anal sacculitis is
common in dogs, it can
also occur in the cat and
 progress to a draining abscess.
Treatment is the same as in the

49a-c Aspergillosis.
49a
Focal nasal and sinus infections
caused by Aspergillus fumigatus
are fairly common in the nasal
 and sinus regions of dogs
 in certain parts of the
 world. This dog had severe
involvement that caused
necrosis and sloughing of the
nasal bone (49a). Prior to the
fungal infection the dog had a
 nasal adenocarcinoma, which
was treated with surgery and
radiation. It was
then complicated by the
 Aspergillus infection. The defect
was successfully managed
surgically and medically (49b).

 diagnosis. The organisms will
stain with acid fast (52c) and
they require special culture
media for bacterial isolation.

This granulomatous mass
involving the ventral thoracic
skin was caused by Pythium
species infection (67a). Many
dogs infected with this organism
 have commonly been exposed
to stagnant water, which is the
source of the infection.
Treatment with antimycotic
drugs rarely controls this
disease. Aggressive surgical
resection of the involved body
part offers the best chance for
 cure. The location and large size
of this lesion would have
prevented complete removal of
67b
 the infected tissue. The dog in

hard palate; this location would
also limit attempts for complete
surgical removal. Same image

confirmed with joint aspiration for
cytology and culture (Streptococcus

well to treatment consisting of
 the appropriate antibiotic drug
and aspiration of the pus. The
 aspiration is therapeutic because
it removes the enzyme-containing
 neutrophils that would damage

disorders
CARDlO comes from the Greek word kardia, meaning heart. Cardiac disease
presents with clinical signs that vary from the subtle to very dramatic. The
physical signs can likewise vary, but when they reach a high degree of severity
the patient can have severe respiratory distress from pulmonary edema,
impaired circulating blood volume as can occur with pericardial effusion,
abdominal distention from ascites, or perhaps acute arterial occlusion as
occurs with a saddle thrombus. Most of the time the experienced clinician
can identify the significance of these lesions, but the first encounter might be
untreated heart disease demands early diagnosis, and most of these diseases
can be diagnosed with a thorough history and physical examination, chest

This heart illustrates the long-
term destruction to the aortic
valve 3 years after acute
vegetative endocarditis. This led
to the dog's demise from
fulminating conges tive

 replacement prior to the onset
of heart failure would improve
this dog's prognosis.

are relatively minor to those that are life threatening. It behooves the
clinician to have a sound understanding of the pathophysiology of these
disorders, because life saving treatment might depend on it. Above all, the
clinician should remember that the airway must be patent and that oxygen
must be available at all times. It is also essential to remember that the two
main functional disorders are defects in ventilation and defects in perfusion.
The ability to recognize this in the patient will dictate the diagnostic and
therapeutic plan. This is one group of diseases where a tissue diagnosis can
be difficult to obtain, thus making it much more important for the clinician
to use all available diagnostic information as accurately as possible
 Electric cord burn in a puppy.
Respiratory disorders
← Many die without ever showing open mouth breathing.
← Watch for the exaggerated abdominal component.
+ Muffled chest sounds: fluid, mass, air, obesity, deep chested, plugged ears'.
← Diffuse muffling - usually chest fluid.
← Dorsal muffling - air or mass in chest.
← Coughing cats: allergic bronchitis, flukes, lungworms, heartworms, hair or foreign body in
trachea, tumor.
← Sudden onset diffuse pulmonary infiltrates - think ARDS and neurogenic pulmonary
edema.
← Bacterial pneumonia plus leukopenia (bone marrow associated) - causes minimal
radiographic infiltrates.
← 3-5 mg (total) ketamine IV for a dyspneic cat can allow 'survival' radiographs.
←  Remember - good side up when radiographing dyspneic patient.
← Aspiration pneumonia can be worse when H2-blockers are used due to altered GI
microflora.

burn (arrow) on its mouth (99a)
 in addition to neurogenic
 (noncardiogenic) pulmonary
 edema. The lateral radiograph
(99b) depicts an alveolar
 infiltrate with air bronchograms,
which is typical of this disorder.
 This respiratory emergency
requires oxygen treatment and,
sometimes, diuretics for severe
cases. The ulcer in the oral
commissure is from the burn
caused by the electric cord. This
is a potentially fatal condition
that should have a guarded

Hematologic
disorders
HEMATOLOGY comes from the Greek word baimatos, meaning blood.
There is no medical disorder that does not impact on the hematopoetic
system, therefore allowing varying amounts of information to be derived
from a complete blood count. Hematology can be a primary disorder, as
seen with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia
or leukemia. It can also play a major role as a secondary disorder that can
reach life-threatening proportions as seen in disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC).
d  e  ap s  ou o 
but the primary clinician can still derive much useful information by him- or
herself, as seen with the determination of macroagglutination, the detection
of hemoglobin in serum, and, sometimes, the surprising discovery of
abnormal cells, reflecting primary disorders elsewhere in the body.
Examples of such abnormalities are illustrated in the following images.
 Scleral hemorrhage in a dog.
Hematologic disorders
→ Unclotted blood in clot tube - consider coagulopathy.
← Massive splenomegaly - splenic torsion, lymphoma, myeloproliferative or mast cell splenic
neoplastic infiltrate.
← Thrombocytopenia plus anemia - causes pale petechiae!
← Fleas plus thrombocytopenia - causes lots of ' lumbosacral petechiae.
+ Low WBCs, low RBCs, low platelets - rule out bone marrow suppression.
← Fulminant hemolysis: anemia, hemaglobinemia, hemaglobinuria, weakness, depression,
+/- vomiting.
← Bone marrow derived leukopenic animals don't make pus!
← Keep IMHA and ITP patients on long-term alternate-day maintenance prednisone for
9-12 months.
←Try danazol (Danocrine) with prednisone for refractory IMHA and ITP.
← Observe for autoagglutination and spherocytes in IMHA.
← Newly acquired bleeding - think anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning.
← A normal bleeding time ensures adequate platelet hemostasis; a normal platelet count does
not.

Gastrointestinal
disorders
GAsTER is derived from the Greek words gaster, meaning stomach or belly,
and enteron, meaning intestines. Gastroenterologic disorders compose a
number of syndromes that are commonly seen in practice. Many are easily
diagnosed, while others can be amongst the most difficult diagnostic
challenges. Although gastroenterology refers to the stomach and the
intestines, the discipline also includes disorders of the pancreas and liver,
thus causing it to have a respectable volume in any of today's textbooks of
medicine.
a thorough history and physical examination. The history should inquire
about any vomiting and diarrhea, and the details of these abnormalities
should be provided. A thorough dietary history is also important. The
routine medical work-up entails a complete blood count; a serum chemistry
panel including serum electrolyte levels; fecal examination for evidence of
parasites; and various specialized tests such as trypsinogen-like
immunoassay, pancreatic lipase immunoassay, vitamin B12 serum
concentration, and several others that can be found in any of the standard
textbooks. Diagnostic imaging commonly involves radiology, abdominal
ultrasonography, and endoscopy. It is essential for the clinician to biopsy any
tissues when the diagnostic evaluation offers that opportunity. The images
that follow illustrate the diverse pathology and the means of diagnosing
many of the disorders that involve the GI system.

 Icterus in the dog
Gastrointestinal disorders
← GI obstructions - main signs are vomiting and anorexia.
←  Acute excruciating abdominal pain (like never before seen!) -- consider bowel infarction
and intestinal volvulus.
← Causes of coffee ground vomitus: gastric ulcers (primary/ secondary), uremic gastritis.
← Causes of melena: upper GI lesion, thrombocytopenia.
+ Occult blood loss - think GI.
← Melena detection - “Let your finger do the walking'
← Black stools: upper GI bleed, thrombocytopenia, swallowing blood, Pepto-Bismol
(bismuth subsalicyclate), iron, charcoal.
← Elevated BUN plus normal creatinine - consider upper GI bleed, especially if kidney can
concentrate urine.
+ Bile in vomitus signifies pyloric patency.
← The lower the obstruction, the more feculent the vomitus.
← Sudden mental depression 2-3 days post enterotomy - rule out dehiscence and sepsis.
← Never let the sun set on a linear foreign body intestinal obstruction.
← Diffuse inflammatory bowel disease can often be diagnosed with distal colon biopsy.
+ Sepsis can cause cholangiostasis.
+ Gas in the gall bladder is bad and is a surgical disease.
← Bilirubinuria in cats signifies liver disease or intravascular hemolysis.
← J-tube feeding for managing the prolonged period of NPO in pancreatitis can be
beneficial.
← Look for pancreatic pathology when the right kidney is easily visible on the radiograph.

recognize the significance of
this pathology.
139  Acute pancreatitis and
139
peritonitis.
Note the firey red peritonitis
 that often accompanies severe
forms of acute pancreatitis, as
shown in this cat's surgical
exploratory. The cat recovered
because of good patient care,
which included intensive care
and a jejunostomy feeding tube
that was placed during the
 surgery and used for providing
vital nutrition for 2 weeks
postoperatively.

141
Acute pancreatitis in the
cat can have many of the same
features found in the dog. This
surgical view
 of acute pancreatitis in
a cat shows extensive calcium
soap formation
on and surrounding the
inflamed pancreas.
 A lymphocytic-plamacytic
form can also occur in the cat.
142  Acute pancreatitis
142
phlegmon.
A phlegmon is a spreading
 suppurative inflammatory
response. In pancreatitis
it appears as a mass of
 inflammatory tissue containing
 mesentery, omentum, and 
 parenchymal tissue. Secondary
bacterial infection can involve
this tissue.
143
 Acute pancreatitis.
143
The abdominal pain with acute
pancreatitis can be almost
intolerable, as shown by this
Poodle's tucked abdominal
posturing. Narcotic analgesics

146 Cholecystitis and
gall stones.
Gall stones had formed in this
 dog, causing an obstructed and
inflamed gall bladder (note the
abnormal tan color of the gall 
 bladder). These lesions are also
 depicted on the accompanying
abdominal ultrasound
examination (see case 147a, b).

 gangrenous. It also contained
inspissated bile. A complete
cholecystectomy was done.
Attempting to suture this gall
bladder closed and replacing it
into the abdomen is an
invitation for postoperative
dehiscence and bile peritonitis.

Apomorphine administration
allowed this Beagle to
vomit three loaves of bread,
which it had mischievously
ingested soon after the owner's
return from the food market. Its
 initial signs were restlessness,
increased salivation, and,
 according to the owner, an
‘expression of distress′ due to
 acute gastric dilatation. Passing
 a stomach tube would not have

medications such as
doxycycline and clindamycin
tablets and capsules can cause
this lesion, which can be
prevented by following the drug

10 ml of water by mouth. The
hemorrhage is the expected
outcome of a successful

The numerous erosions are
typical for this particular

severe blood loss, which is
 amenable to proton pump

are indicated for patients
suffering from substantial
blood loss.
159 Gastric ulcers.
159
These lesions occurred in a dog
that had received only one dose
 of a human NSAID, which was
 soon followed by unremitting
 melena and ultimately
 exsanguination. The erosions
 are typical of NSAID-induced
 gastric pathology. This episode
occurred before the
 development of modern
 antacid drugs.
126
Gastrointestinaldisorders
160 Gastric ulcers.
160
These two large crater ulcers
 almost perforated the gastric
wall. They were caused by
irritation from ingested
fiberglass insulation material.
 Ulcers this large and deep
 require surgical debridement 
and closure.
161
 Gastric ulcer:
161
glucocorticoid-induced.
This large crater ulcer was most
likely due to the large doses of
 dexamethasone this dog was
receiving for its immune
thrombocytopenia. The dog's
clinical signs included anterior
 abdominal pain, retching,
 and melena.
162 Gastric antral mucosal
162
hyperplasia.
A gastroscopic view of this
 condition is shown. It can cause
pyloric outflow obstruction and
require surgical resection.
Chronic vomiting of gastric

Gastroenteritis with

 Shown is a sample of sloughed
small bowel mucosa that
 accompanied a severe bout of
 gastroenteritis in a Poodle.
Enterotoxemia and possibly
sepsis are expected
complications as a result of the
breakdown of the mucosal
defense mechanism. Such
 patients usually require
intensive care for as long as 7
 days because of accompanying
multiple organ dysfunction.
168 Glossitis.
168
 Necrotic glossitis involving
 most of this cat's tongue was a
reason for a very guarded
 prognosis. There are various
causes of this condition
 including caustic substances,
viral disease, vascular
compromise through infarction
or vasculitis, and metabolic
disorders (uremia).
Glossitis can be
 accompanied by stomatitis.

gastroscopy. Hookworms
(Ancylostoma species) are
visualized on these
 gastroscopic views.

Gastrointestinal disorders
170a, b Hemorrhagic
170a
gastroenteritis.
This is a gastrointestinal
emergency associated with
a peracute loss of blood
 and plasma. The dog's PCV is
usually elevated because of the
greater loss of plasma over red
blood cells and, perhaps,
splenic contraction causing
release of red blood cells into
the circulation.
170b
171 Hepatic lipidosis.
171
Primary hepatic lipidosis in the
cat can cause death from liver
failure in approximately 50% of
cases, especially when it is
severe, as shown in this image.
 Minimal digital pressure caused
the friability seen on the
surface. The secondary form
that occurs in diabetic animals
is temporary and resolves when
the diabetes is under control.
133
Gastrointestinal disorders
172 Icterus.
172
Jaundiced mucous membranes
 appear orange when the red
blood cell count is near normal,
as shown in this dog. The
 combined red hue from
 hemoglobin and the yellow
from the icterus produce
the orange color.
173 Icterus.
173
 This dog's oral mucous 
membranes are very yellow
instead of orange because of its
severe hemolytic anemia (PCV
0.1 1/1 [10%]), which deprives
the tissues of the red
 Oxygenated hemoglobin color.
It is the combination of red
(from red blood cells) and
yellow (from jaundice) that
produces the orange colored
mucous membranes.
Appreciating this can allow the
 clinician to plan to provide the
 patient with transfused red
blood cells.
174a, b Icteric cat.
174a
174b
The intense icterus in this cat
was caused by suppurative
cholangiohepatitis with biliary

and bile duct obstruction
caused by inspissated
bile (174b).

caused by an intestinal volvulus.
 The diffuse gas-distended
bowel represents the
 gangrenous bowel loops, as
depicted in 176. This should be
regarded as a surgical
 emergency after the patient is
first stabilized with IV fluids,
 antibiotics, and vasopressors,
if necessary.
176 Intestinal

The green-black color 
 represents gangrene. The dog
was euthanized.
177 Ileal muscular

Cirrhosis is associated with
 chronic signs of liver failure,
with clinical signs that might
only consist of anorexia and

 predisposed to this disorder,
which eventually will cause the
 patient's demise. The
macronodular form is shown.
179a-c  Liver: micronodular

cirrhosis and varices.
These postmortem findings are
from a dog that died from
 progressive liver failure. It had

182 Feculent vomitus.
Brown colored malodorous
vomitus commonly occurs

 somewhere between the distal
jejunum and the colon.

 A jejunal venous angiogram
was done surgically to
demonstrate the large
extravascular congenital shunt
vessel that is shunting blood
from the portal vein into the
posterior vena cava. Portacaval
venous anomalies can be either
extrahepatic (usually in small
breed dogs) or intrahepatic
(usually in large breed dogs).
187  Small bowel infarction.
187
This small bowel
infarction (also shown in
the hematology section, case
133,p. 111) occurred as a result
 of the prothrombotic
effects of large doses of
 glucocorticoids that were being
used to treat the dog's immune
hemolytic anemia. Perforation
 and sepsis will occur if the
 infarcted segment is not 
removed in a timely
manner (first few hours).
188  Small bowel infarction.

This postmortem lesion was
caused by an arterial embolus

190a, b Small bowel linear
foreign body obstruction.
A careful examination under
this cat's tongue discovered a
 black sewing thread
sublingually (arrow). If the cat
was vomiting, as it was in this 
 case, surgery would be needed
because vomiting is a sign of
 obstruction. If the cat was
 acting normally (eating and
 defecating) after the ingestion
 of the linear foreign body, there
could be a chance for it to
 passage successfully through
the bowel.

195a, b Small bowel linear
foreign body obstruction.
This small bowel shows the
classic pleating caused by
a linear foreign body
 obstruction in a cat (195a).
This abnormality can be
detected with abdominal
palpation and on a plain
radiograph (to the trained eye),
where it appears as a gathering
 of the small bowel loops,
with asymmetrical segmental
dilatation (195b). Perforations
 are routinely found on
the mesenteric border
(arrow in 194).

foreign body.
 Note the sublingual sewing
 thread foreign body and the
circumlinear sublingual
ulcerations. The remainder of
this ingested linear foreign body
was causing small intestinal
obstruction that had resulted in
 anorexia, vomiting, and
dehydration prior to
surgical correction.
197a, b
 Small bowel
197a
 obstruction: corn
cob-induced.
These close-up abdominal
 radiographs show a gas pattern
indicative of a small bowel
obstruction. They also indicate
the cause, as shown by the air
cells in the corn cob (arrow).
The abnormally distended
loops of small intestine indicate
obstruction, and this is the
 main indication for surgery.
Some intestinal foreign bodies
will pass harmlessly through the
bowel in the asymptomatic
 patient; however, any vomiting
and anorexia will make
197b
surgery imminent.
145
Gastrointestinaldisorders
198  Oral foreign body:
198
sewing needle.
Cats that ingest a sewing needle
can have it lodge in their hard

 panic reaction during its 
removal can be a calamity. The
 sharp pointed end is usually
 pointed anteriorly.

 Migrating foreign
body: sewing needle.
 A sewing needle can penetrate
 the frenulum and migrate in the
cervical soft tissues to cause
severe cellulitis. Removal is not

assessed accurately
radiographically.

Gastrointestinal disorders
200 Stomatitis.
200
Inflammation of the oral
mucous membranes can occur
as a result of dental disease,
caustic substances, infectious
diseases, and immune-mediated
 diseases. The exact diagnosis
 usually requires biopsy and
special testing if obvious causes 
 are ruled out with the history
and physical examination.
201
 Severe ulcerative
201
stomatitis.
The palate lesions in this
cat were first tentatively
diagnosed as eosinophilic
 granuloma complex, but they
continued to erode and caused
complete penetrating lesions 
through the palatine bones.
Biopsies identified the lesions
only as stomatitis of
unknown origin.
202 Stomatitis.
202
Severe stomatitis, as seen in this
Cocker Spaniel, might be
causally related to dental
 microflora and be refractory to
treatment with antibiotics and
glucocorticoids until the
decision is made to extract all of
its teeth. Extracting normal
teeth is a very lengthy
procedure that can take as
long as 2 hours.

Endocrine
disorders
ENDOCRINOLOGY is derived from the Greek word endon, meaning within,
and krin, meaning to separate. Disorders of this medical discipline include
several interesting syndromes, a number of which involve metabolism,
including fluid and electrolyte disorders. Endocrinopathies can involve
different organ systems throughout the body, thereby requiring the clinician
to have a broad knowledge base in order to fully understand the
used to assess a patient with an endocrine disorder, but special tests are
required in order to fully evaluate the endocrine disorders.
The images in this section illustrate the highlights of several
endocrinopathies and should prove useful to the practicing clinician.

Hyperadrenocorticism.
A postmortem specimen of
bilateral adrenocortical
 adenomatous hyperplasia is
shown (209a). This is
sometimes mistaken for adrenal
malignancy on ultrasonography
(209b). The differential
diagnoses for this sonogram
would be adrenocortical
 nodular hyperplasia,
 adrenocortical adenoma,
adrenocortical
 adenocarcinoma, and
pheochromocytoma.
Depressed serum cortisol
blood levels on the post

Hyperadrenocorticism.
A 10-year-old cat with
hyperadrenocorticism caused
 by exogenous repositol
glucocorticoid treatment is 
shown (210a). Note the folded
ear tips (210b) and the
characteristic skin tears (210c)
caused by altered collagen
structure and epidermal
fragility, respectively. Many cats
with hyperadrenocorticism

calcinosis cutis.
The inflammatory form of
calcinosis cutis is shown in two
 commonly involved areas,
the inguinal and axillary
 regions. Not all dogs with
hypercortisolism have this skin
disorder. It can cause
discomfort because of its
location in regard to limb
movement. Drying alum-

Adrenocortical carcinomas can
sometimes undergo
spontaneous retroperitoneal
hemorrhage, as shown in these

peritoneum bulges into the
abdominal cavity. When this
 episode occurred the night

acute signs of weakness and
 hypovolemia and had to be

Acromegaly.
221a
The dentition in this adult female
 Irish Setter shows the gingival
hyperplasia and wide interdental
 spaces typical of acromegaly in
the dog. This dog was in diestrus 
 and had coexisting diabetes
 mellitus associated with insulin
resistance caused by the excess
 growth hormone secretion.
Acromegaly will resolve once the
hyperprogestagen secretion is
terminated. The acromegaly and
the diabetes resolved in this dog
221b
following ovariohysterectomy.
222a
222a, b Acromegaly.
 Medroxyprogesterone acetate
injections caused the acromegaly
and associated respiratory stridor
in this dog (222a). This latter
 problem is caused by the growth
hormone-induced pharyngeal
hyperplasia. The increased
pharyngeal soft tissue can be
seen on this dog's lateral
radiograph (222b - arrow).
Artificial airway support is not
always necessary. The dog also
had a mammary gland carcinoma
 on her right 3rd gland (arrow),
which might have been
influenced by the excess growth
hormone production. Growth
hormone can be an oncogenic
stimulus in mammary tissue.

This female Poodle became
 acromegalic during her estrus
cycle (diestrus). Ovario-
hysterectomy was eventually
performed to resolve the
problem. The resulting
proliferation of pharyngeal

 Diabetic ketoacidosis.
 This dog is in a terminal status
because of diabetic
ketoacidosis, acute pancreatitis,
and anuric renal failure. Note
the empty urine collection
bottle in a dog that would
ordinarily be polyuric. The
blood glucose level at the time
of the anuria was approximately
55 mmol/l (1,000 mg/dl). This
would offer a grave prognosis.
225 Diabetic cat with
225
hypercortisolism.
This cat was made “cushingoid'
iatrogenically with
glucocorticoid injections. He
also became diabetic and then
 had diabetic neuropathy, as seen 
by the plantar posturing. The
hypercortisolism signs
eventually disappeared as the
glucocorticoid levels declined
over time. The insulin-requiring
diabetic condition also resolved
 after approximately 2 years.

associated with a routine
venipuncture and caused the cat
 to go into acute diabetic

untreated diabetic's
 predisposition to infection,
which is due to impaired
neutrophil bactericidal ability as
well as impaired B- and T-cell

Urogenital
disorders
UROGENITIAL is derived from the Greek words ouron, meaning urine, and
the Latin word genitalis, pertaining to reproduction. This specialty includes
a variety of clinical disorders, because it covers the entire urinary and
reproductive systems. Although kidney disorders can be covered in its own
nephrology specialty, they can also be included in the urogenital system.
Several interesting clinical disorders can therefore be covered in this organ
system. Certain diagnostic tests are essential for urinary disorders, including
hematology and serum chemistry analysis, urinalysis, and various forms of
Abdominal ultrasonography is one of the most helpful diagnostic
tools for evaluating the internal genital organs, while a thorough physical
examination will be of much diagnostic value. Some of the images that
follow might not be that rare, but several of the others might be considered
to be highly interesting.

← Rule out pyometra in any sick intact female.
+ Never let the sun set on a pyo (Garvey, M).
+ Murky urine can be caused by: pus, chyle, crystals.
← Bilateral renomegaly means very serious disease: lymphoma, hydronephrosis, pyonephrosis,
granuloma, inflammation, subcapsular edema, polycystic kidney.
← Cats: 1 big kidney plus 1 small kidney can mean 1 fibrotic kidney and 1 compensatory
hypertrophic kidney.
← Hematuria without stranguria - consider coagulopathy or renal bleed; however, recent renal
bleed plus clots - can cause stranguria.
←  Male dog plus stranguria - must radiograph to rule out obstructive uropathy.
←  Oliguric renal failure - hyperkalemia common.
←  High output chronic renal failure - normo- or hypokalemia common.
← Emphysematous cystitis - rule out diabetes mellitus.
←I
 PD plus PU plus isosthenuria - consider chronic renal disease, even with normal BUN and
creatinine, but watch out for Cushing's.
← Careful on cystocentesis with pyometra -look before your stick!
← Prostate trends: carcinoma - asymmetrical, hard, mid or caudal pelvis; benign prostatic
hyperplasia -- symmetrical, firm, anterior displacement.
← Empty urine line: anuria, recent emptying, obstruction.
← Always assess urine SG before starting fluid therapy.
← BPH: passive penile bleed, normal urination, normal dog.
← Detection of urethral pathology in a female dog, do rectal examination.

 Chronic renal
268a
fibrosis.
The dog that had these severely
fibrotic kidneys (268a) suffered
from advanced uremia,
polydipsia and polyuria, and
renal osteodystrophy. Note the
highly irregular surface and
margins due to the tissue
contraction brought about by
the fibrosis. The latter problem
resulted from advanced
secondary renal
hyperparathyroidism. The
 hyperplastic parathyroid glands
are shown. The dog (268b)
shows typical facial features of
uremic toxicity including
 marked mental depression,
'muddy’ oral mucous
membranes, and 'uremic frost'
 on its nose. Uremic frost refers
to a crystalline deposit found
on the skin in humans
 associated with uremia. In dogs
this can occur on the nasal
epithelium.

192
Urogenital disorders
269a, b Renal hematuria.
269a
The ureteral catheter placed at
 surgery localized the right 
kidney as the source of this
dog's hematuria (269a).
The diagnosis was initially
thought to be idiopathic
hematuria, but the resected
kidney shows the cause as a
 bleeding papilloma deep in the
renal pelvis (269b).
269b
270
 Hypoproteinemia
270
and anasarca.
Glomerulopathy in this cat
 caused its hypoproteinemia and
anasarca. Note the edematous
areas under the chin,
anterior thorax, and
 dependent limb regions.

Urogenital disorders
271a
271a-c Renal
 osteodystrophy: mandible.
This dog's mandibular pliability
(rubber jaw) (271a, b) is a result
 of renal osteodystrophy
 accompanying end-stage renal
disease. The kidneys of this
same dog show a pitted and
irregular surface due to chronic
renal fibrosis, which progressed
to end-stage kidney disease
(271c). Also shown are enlarged
 parathyroid glands on
the thyroid glands due
to secondary renal
hyperparathyroidism.

 osteodystrophy: maxilla.
 Note the maxillary proliferation
involving the face of this 18-
 month-old Golden Retriever
(272a, b). This is another but
more rare form of
 renal osteodystrophy.
The proliferative bony change
even caused maxillary venous
 stasis. These small cystic,
end-stage kidneys (272c) are
from the same dog; they
are presumably
 congenital lesions.

273 Urinary bladder leak.
A cystocentesis was performed
 on this Pug about 2 hours prior
 to surgery. The dog had a
severely inflamed bladder that
had not yet sealed off the
 needle puncture site that was
 made preoperatively.
274a, b Uteromegaly: cat.
274a
This cat's abdominal radiograph
(274a) shows very large
uteromegaly. Note the
dorsocranial displacement of
the abdominal viscera. On
 surgery this was found to be a
pyometra (274b). This is not
much different from the
pyometra shown in 267a. The
 reader can appreciate the
potential danger in a blind
cystocentesis procedure in
this patient.

Urogenital disorders
275a-c
 Transitional cell
275a
carcinoma and cystitis.
 Ultrasonography of the urinary
bladder is a helpful diagnostic
tool, but it does not always
provide a confirmed definitive
diagnosis. The ultrasonogram of
a dog's urinary bladder (275a)
depicts small calculi on
 the ventral aspect of the bladder
(small arrows) and a mass lesion
 involving the dorsal aspect (large
arrow). The mass is a
transitional cell carcinoma. An 
ultrasonogram from a cat is also
shown (275b). This cat also has
275b
a soft tissue density on the
 dorsal aspect of the urinary
bladder (arge arrow), but in this
case it is proliferating
inflammatory tissue caused by E
coli cystitis, which was tentatively
diagnosed based on cytology
and culture results obtained
 from an ultrasound-guided fine
needle aspirate specimen. The
cat's problem resolved after 2
weeks of antibiotic treatment, as
 shown in the follow-up
ultrasonogram (275c).

276a, b
Pyonephrosis.
 This kidney was abnormally
enlarged, with much of the
 parenchyma replaced by
suppurative exudate (276a).
The dog's urinalysis was
unremarkable because the
involved kidney also had
ureteral obstruction as a result
of the inflammation. The
ultrasonogram (276b) is
from a cat with pyonephrosis,
showing renal pelvis
dilatation and debris and
necrotic parenchyma.
276b
277 Polycystic kidneys.
277
 Persian cats are particularly
prone to this congenital disorder.
These kidneys had progressed to
end-stage renal failure. The
pathology showing the multiple
 cysts is obvious in this image.
 Clinically, the diagnosis is easily
 made with ultrasonography of
the kidneys.
198
Urogenital disorders
278a-c Uterine necrosis.
278a
 Focal gangrenous metritis in a
 mixed breed dog caused severe
postpartum sepsis. Shown are
lateral and dorsoventral
radiographs (278a, b)
 indicating a distended gas-filled
uterus (arrow), which was
subsequently surgically
removed. There is also some
loss of abdominal detail, sug-
 gesting fluid or peritonitis. The
 postoperative specimen shows
 gangrene involving the uterine
body and the left uterine
horn (278c).

discharge or the owner
observing the penis protruding
from the vulva.
280 Hydrometra.

Hydrometra is one of several
causes of uterine enlargement
 in dogs and cats. This cat had
obvious abdominal distension.

281a
outflow obstruction.
This complicated case of feline
urinary bladder obstruction
terminated with anuric renal
failure due to severe
 hemorrhagic cystitis, which
 caused bilateral distal ureteral
orifice obstruction (281a). The
lead 2 electrocardiogram
(281b) shows aberrant
 atrial-ventricular conduction, a
 pattern compatible with an 
underlying hyperkalemia. The

Neurologic
disorders
NEURO is derived from the Greek word neuron, meaning 'sinew'. The
competent practice of internal medicine is almost impossible without a firm
 sd  a si s o   
 present to the clinician with one disease, only to be complicated by another
disorder that can involve the nervous system; for example, a dog or cat with
a bleeding disorder that suffers a hemorrhagic stroke or hypoxia causing an
epileptogenic focus in the cerebrum.
My mentor taught me that neurology is the queen that shows mastery
of a clinician's history taking and physical examination skills. This is the one
main discipline where 'A picture is worth a thousand words' comes to life,
because it demands the cognitive skills of the clinician. The images that
follow will illustrate this well.

 Left-sided Horner's syndrome in a geriatric dog
0
Neurologic disorders
← Rapid onset LMN paralysis - think ticks, organophosphate, botulism,
polyradiculoneuropathy, metronidazole, coral snake.
← Cats with dilated pupils and blank stare - think thiamine deficiency
← Coma -- diffuse cerebral, stem, but don't forget metabolic.
 282  Facial nerve pathology.
282
This cat detects enough pain on
the right side of its face to close
its right eye, indicating that the
left trigeminal sensory motor
pathway is working. The absent
blink on the left side indicates a
left facial nerve dysfunction.
 283a, b Horner's syndrome.
283a
283b
Note the Horner's complex on
the cat's right side ipsilateral to
the right forelimb weakness
(brachial palsy), reflecting
pathology involving the nerve
roots in the area of C5, C6, C7,
and T1-2. Trauma, lymphoma,
and neurofibroma or
neurosarcoma would be in the
list of differential diagnoses.

284 Horner's syndrome.
284
This geriatric dog has
characteristic features
of left-sided Horner's
syndrome (i.e. miosis, ptosis,
 and enophthalmos). The
causes can vary.
285a, b Frontal lobe tumor.
285a
This Labrador Retriever has a
 left frontal cerebral lobe tumor,
which caused its dementia, head
pressing, and circling (285a).
Seizures can also occur with
this type of lesion. A cerebral
lobe tumor is shown involving
the left side, as evidenced by the
swollen gyri (285b). The dog
would circle to the side
 opposite the lesion.
285b
205
Neurologic disorders
286a
286a, b Schiff-
Sherrington posture.
 The Schiff-Sherrington posture
shown in this dog is due to a
severe spinal cord lesion in the
thoracolumbar spinal cord
 region. The dog had an acute
 collapse caused by a bleeding
hemangiosarcoma in the epaxial
muscles (primary origin) (286a)
and the floor of the spinal
canal, as shown in the
postmortem specimen
(286b). This was the only site of
tumor involvement in this dog.
(See also images 311a-c).
286b
287 Anisocoria.
287
Anisocoria is the term used to
describe unequally sized pupils.
This cat's right pupil is miotic
due to pathology involving the
ipsilateral sympathetic nerve
 innervation, thus impairing pupil
dilation on the right side. Other
features of Horner's syndrome
 are evident as well, including
 ptosis and enophthalmos (note
the 3rd eyelid prominence).
206
Neurologic disorders
288a-c Tetanus.
288a
These three images
illustrate severe tetanus
 in a Malamute puppy.
The generalized muscle
 spasticity and the risus
sardonicus facial expression are
typical of this infection in the
dog. The recumbent posture 
was soon accompanied
by impaired ventilation
 and hyperthermia, which
offered a very guarded to
 grave prognosis.
288b
207
Neurologic disorders
289a
289a-c
Tetanus.
This mixed breed dog acquired
tetanus from a contaminated
 perineal skin wound. Being able
to stand, walk, and swallow
offered the dog a good
prognosis. Treatment at this 
stage entailed wound care and
using an antibiotic such
as metronidazole, which would
be effective against CZostridium
tetani. Tetanus antitoxin would
not reverse clinical signs that
are already present, but it would
help prevent progression of
signs from further absorption
of toxin from the site
of infection.
289b
289c
290a
290a-c Tetanus.
Classic risus sardonicus is shown
in this 3-year-old female St.
Bernard's face (290a). She also
had classic lock-jaw (290a, b),
but never lost the ability to stand
and walk, albeit slowly and
stiffly, during the peak period of
her syndrome. Like many other
patients with this disease, this
dog did not have any noticeable
wound, but she was still treated
with procaine penicillin. She
recovered well.

Tetanus: cat.
291a
Although cats rarely acquire
tetanus, this male cat was one of
the unfortunate victims. The cat
had extensor hindimb posture
 and an inability to urinate,
which required him to have a
urinary catheter (291a). He also
had spasticity involving his
 muscles of facial expression.

293  Spinal dysraphism.
293
The Weimeraner is one of
 several breeds predisposed to
 this congenital cavitating spinal
dorsal column disorder, which
 causes affected dogs to move
with a bunny-hop' gait. As the
dogs grow, joint disease from
the abnormal posturing will
complicate the clinical course.
294a, b Meningitis.

This young German Shorthair
 Pointer has steroid-responsive
meningitis (294a). She

295a, b Brain hemorrhage.
295a
Blunt trauma to the head
 of this dog caused massive
subarachnoid hemorrhage
throughout the brain. Both the
 cerebrum and brainstem were
affected. Coma and absent
cranial nerve reflexes
characterized this dog's
 antemortem clinical findings.
295b
296  Cervical rigidity.
296
This dog is showing classic
signs for cervical pain, which
can be due to any form of
pathology that irritates the
dorsal cervical nerve roots or
the meninges.
212
Neurologic disorders
297  Cranial nerve V palsy.
297
This dog was unable to
voluntarily close its mouth
because it had an idiopathic
palsy of the motor branch
 of the trigeminal nerve. The
cause is usually idiopathic and
some dogs make a spontaneous
recovery. Other differentials for
this sign would include
temporomandibular
 joint pathology, bilateral
 mandibular rami fractures,
and rabies.
 298a, b Vestibular
298a
 syndrome: feline.
The anxiety displayed by this
cat (298a) is a result of its
vertiginous state due to right-
sided vestibular dysfunction
 caused by a veterinarian's ear
cleaning procedure. There is 
also a mild Horner's
syndrome involving the right
side, as evidenced by the
narrower pupil (298b). This
resulted from an insult to the
sympathetic nerve as it
traversed the traumatized
right tympanic bulla.

 Cranial nerve VII
palsy (Bell's palsy).
This Samoyed shows facial
muscle asymmetry because of
 its right-sided cranial nerve VII
palsy. Most of these afflictions 
in the dog are idiopathic and are
characterized by weak muscles
of facial expression on the
involved side. This dog has a
right-sided lip droop with
drooling and it is unable
to retract its orbicularis
oris muscle.
299b
299c
 300   Uremic encephalopathy.
300
An extreme uremic condition
 can cause encephalopathy,
which is a near terminal sign. It
occurs because of an
accumulation of uremic toxins
consisting of metabolites of
proteins and amino acids. This
cat was in such a state that
seizures could even have
 occurred. The main clinical sign
was dementia.
214
Neurologic disorders
 301a-e Narcolepsy.
301a

Narcolepsy is a rare condition
characterized by recurrent

trigger these episodes in the
dog, as shown in this 
Airedale Terrier.

Neoplastic
disorders
NEOPLAsIA comes from the Greek words neo, meaning new, and plasis,
meaning molding. Cancer has reached epidemic proportions in human and
veterinary medicine and it should come as no surprise that close to 40% of
the cases that come into a veterinary referral facility are cancerous disorders.
Therefore, it behooves the clinician to know when to biopsy a tissue that
might be neoplastic. Cancer can involve any tissue of the body and this,
therefore, offers a clinician the opportunity to observe several interesting
disorders. The two main diagnostic modalities are imaging and biopsy, but it
is still essential to evaluate the entire patient in order to appreciate the full
scope of the disease at hand. Many of the lesions illustrated will be available
to visualization and palpation, thus making a thorough physical examination
an essential part of the diagnostic evaluation.

 Squamous cell carcinoma (tongue).
Neoplastic disorders
← Cutaneous mast cell tumors can mimic any type of skin growth.
← Assume any firm mammary nodule as carcinoma until proven otherwise.
←  Mammary tumors -- don't stick it, cut it.
←Don't miss lymphangitic inflammatory mammary carcinoma.
+ Nasal disease can do anything.
 Copious mucoid nasal discharge - think nasal adenocarcinoma.
Try gastric biopsy forceps for nasal biopsy.
← Closed mouth nasal cavity radiographs are useless.
← Cancer can cause elevated total WBCs and fever.
302a
302a-e Intestinal
carcinoma.
The annular carcinoma located
at the ileocecal region in this
dog caused stool to accumulate
 proximal to the site of
obstruction, resulting in 
the dog becoming severely
obstipated. Surgical resection
and anastomosis was necessary
to relieve the dog of his
discomfort. Shown is the
lateral radiograph (302a), the
intact and resected intestine
(302b, c), and the dissected
segment of the excised ileum
proximal to the obstruction
(arrow) (302d). The dog

305b
306a
306a, b Cutaneous
hemangiosarcoma.
What was initially thought to be a
spider bite lesion in this cat was
actually a cutaneous
hemangiosarcoma, which was
 confirmed with a skin biopsy. The
initial lesions appeared as bruises 
(306a), but the cancer defined
itself better with time (306b).
Cutaneous hemangiosarcoma
 can sometimes cause DIC.

310 Hemangiosarcoma:
310
thigh muscles.
This Beagle's right
hindlimb had a sudden onset
of swelling from the bleeding
that resulted from a
hemangiosarcoma originating
in its right thigh muscles. The
dog's history is typical for this
particular tumor in this
particular location. Fine needle
aspiration is typically
bloody and representative
sarcoma cells might not be
recognized. The surgeon will 
often mistake the
hemangiomatous muscles
as blood clots. Both DIC
and metastasis are common
complications.

 This dog (317a) presented with
 signs similar to septic mastitis,

had a leukocytosis of
 approximately 60,000/ml.
The second dog (317b)

enlarged prescapular lymph
 node is obvious.
329 Anal sac carcinoma.
329
This Dalmation has a firm
swelling at the 4 o'clock
 position in the para-anal

anal sac carcinoma. Anal sac
carcinoma is the second most
common cause of
 hypercalcemia of malignancy
in the dog.

 330a-c Lung carcinoma.
330a
The right caudal lung lobe is a
 common primary site
of pulmonary carcinoma in the
 dog. Masses attaining this size
will probably have had ample
 opportunity to metastasize, as
 seen in this patient. Surgical
 resection and chemotherapy
 might provide several months
of life.

The bilateral, distal hindlimb
 neoplastic lesions in this

the symmetrical swelling
 involving all four distal
appendages (332b) and the
radiographic demonstration
of periosteal proliferation
(arrow) characteristic of

 Sertoli cell tumor.
This male German Shepherd
Dog (334a) shows signs of
feminization from the retained
Sertoli cell testicular tumor seen
 on the accompanying
abdominal radiograph (334b).
The feminization signs include
a redistribution of body fat,
skin hyperpigmentation
and alopecia involving the
 posterior thighs and caudal
ventral abdomen, and
mammary gland thickening.
Also described in case 233.
334b
335
335 Sertoli cell tumor:

this particular area (arrows).
This is shown more clearly
in 340. The tumor cells can be
 obtained by performing a
 prostatic-urethral wash
technique using a urethral
 catheter, or they can be
obtained with an ultrasound-

Toxicologic disorders
including snake bite envenomation
ToXICOLOGY is derived from the Latin word toxicon, meaning poison. In
small animal veterinary clinical practice, cases will often present as medical
emergencies. The diagnosis and medical treatment are often fairly routine
when the history provides the knowledge of exposure, but when that
information is unavailable, the diagnosis will pose a definite challenge to the
clinician. This is why the recognition of the characteristic signs of certain
toxins is essential for making a timely and often life saving diagnosis. The
images that follow are all from true life cases representing the more
common clinical toxicologic disorders. The clinician should also remember
the antidotes for the various toxins and have them readily available in the
hospital or close-by, where access can be expedient.
The reader will hopefully excuse the author for including snake bite
envenomation in this 'picture book', but the nature of my practice in the
State of Florida has offered me the opportunity to witness the devastating
consequences that can occur when dogs and cats are envenomated by
certain species of snakes. Although the examples that follow are due to
snakes 1ndigenous to the Southeast United States, there are various other
related snakes in other parts of the world that can cause similar pathology.
Here again, modern day travel can bring animals from afar to parts of the
world where these poisonous snakes prevail, thereby justifying some
familiarization with these very interesting disorders.

← Ethylene glycol fluoresces.
← Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, succimer) - a new oral treatment for lead poisoning.
← Unexplainable radiodense particles in the bowel - think lead.
← 4-methylpyrazole 5% for antifreeze intoxication - avoids hangovers.
+ Newer anticoagulant rodenticides -- treat for 4-6 weeks.
← Newly acquired bleeding - think anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning.
342a
342b
342a-c Acetaminophen
intoxication.
The facial edema (342a)
and cyanotic mucous
membranes (342b, c) in this cat
are the result of acetaminophen
intoxication. The edema is most
likely due to endothelial space
leakage caused by the
hypoxemia. This will respond to
the antidote acetylcysteine and
 Other supportive treatment such
 as parenteral fluids, SAMe, milk
thistle, vitamin C, and oxygen.
342c
246
Toxicologic disorders
12
343a-c Acetaminophen
343a
intoxication.
 Methemoglobinemia is one of
the metabolic side-effects of
acetaminophen intoxication.
This reduced form of
hemoglobin is responsible for
the 'chocolate-colored blood’
(343a) and the clinical cyanosis.
Methylene blue would ordinarily
reverse this effect, but it
is contraindicated in the
cat because of its ability
to worsen the Heinz body
hemolytic anemia (343b) (also
shown in case 122, p. 103).
 Instead, ascorbic acid can be
343b
 given, but with less benefit 
toward this particular problem.
The green urine precipitate
(343c) is a metabolite of the
acetaminophen that accompanied
 the hemoglobinuria.

344a-c Anticoagulant
rodenticide intoxication.
These left lateral (344a)
 and right lateral (344b)
chest radiographs are from
 a dog that had ingested
 an anticoagulant rodenticide.
 The pulmonary parenchymal
infiltrate and pleural
effusion are common areas of
hemorrhage in dogs with this
disorder. A narrowed tracheal
 lumen caused by bleeding just 
above the trachealis membrane
can be seen (344c).

rodenticide intoxication.
Any dog with an acquired
hemorrhagic disorder, as
illustrated in this dog
with ventral abdominal
ecchymoses and bleeding from
venipuncture sites on its limb,
should be suspect for first or
second generation
anticoagulant rodenticide
intoxication.

its ingestion of warfarin
anticoagulant rodenticide. The
eyeball itself and its contents 
were normal.
346c
347  Bromethalin rodenticide
347
intoxication.
Bromethalin is a rodenticide that
 inhibits mitochondrial energy
 production. The clinical signs are
 neurologic, ranging from
weakness to coma caused by the
cerebral edema that can ensue
within 12-24 hours. This terrier
(5a) ingested an unknown
quantity of bromethalin. The
owner's history and their
remembering to bring the package
containing the poison (5b) were
very helpful to the clinicians
caring for this dog. Its signs never
worsened beyond mild weakness
following anemetic treatment.
Hospitalization for observation
 and timely treatment is important
249
 for this particular intoxicant.
Toxicologic disorders
348
348 Cholecalciferol rodenticide
intoxication.
 Many rodenticides are easily
accessible to the pet owning public,
which unfortunately makes these
poisons similarly accessible to the
dog or cat waiting to ingest them.
Cholecalciferol is a rat poison. It 
works by causing severe
hypercalcemia that can go on to
cause organ mineralization and
subsequent failure. The
radiographic image of the kidney
 shows a damaging degree of
 nephrocalcinosis. Treatment with
calcitonin, glucocorticoids, and
intravenous fluids can benefit the
cholecalciferol intoxicated patient.
349a
349a, b Lead intoxication.
This 11-year-old neutered male
 domestic shorthair cat was
examined for the primary
complaints of mental dullness
 and decreased activity since its
return from New York City,
where it had resided during
 apartment renovations. The
 possible exposure to lead dust
was a cause for suspicion for
lead intoxication and a
subsequent blood lead
 measurement was 10x normal.
The cat responded to calcium
EDTA treatment. The cat,
shown in the illustration (349a),
349b
had very subtle signs, which
made the case that much more
of a diagnostic challenge. The
history was of key importance
in this instance because
environments, such as the one
shown in the picture illustrating
the peeling paint (349b), can be
a major source of intoxication.

Toxicologic disorders
350a-d   Lead intoxication.

 This Poodl puppy acquired lead
poisoning from plaster
ingestion. Shown is the painful
abdominal posturing caused by
lead colic (350a), lead lines' at
the growth plates (350b), and
the lead containing plaster
fragments within the stomach
(350c). The blood smear (350d)
shows nucleated red blood cells
and basophilic stippling (also
shown in case 123, p. 103),
which are common hematologic
effects of lead poisoning
(plumbism). The puppy
responded well to calcium 
EDTA treatment.

 This kidney belonged to a cat
 that went into progressive renal 
failure from ethylene glycol
intoxication. The kidneys were
palpably enlarged because of
the subcapsular renal edema
associated with acute renal
failure (arrows). The urine
specific gravity was isosthenuric
 and the renal failure was
progressive.
351c
352  Ethylene glycol
352
intoxication.
Oxalate crystalluria is a
metabolic by-product 
after ethylene glycol is ingested
and metabolized by the liver
enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.
 A dihydrate crystal resembling
an envelope or a Maltese
cross in shape is shown.
The crystals are harmful to the
renal tubules. The prognosis for
recovery is guarded to grave.
252

 in some cases of ethylene glycol
intoxication.
354a, b Ethylene glycol

 Black widow spider
356a
envenomation.
 This cat presented with a
sudden onset of exquisite pain,
 especially on its abdomen
(356a, b). It had been lying on
the porch where the owner
professed to seeing various
 spiders, including a black
widow. Based on the signs,
including a focal suspect bite
356b
wound on the ventral abdomen,
356c
and history, Lactrodectus
mactans antivenin was adminis-
tered intravenously. The cat was
normal within a few hours
(356c).

Toxicologic disorders
357a, b Coral snake bite
357a
357b
wound site.
The dark bleb on the inner
aspect of this dog's right upper
lip (357a) represents the site of
envenomation by an Eastern
coral snake. The bite of a coral
snake is always small and
benign in appearance. It can
 also appear as small punctuate
wounds, as shown (357b). Coral
snake bite wounds are only
evident 50% of the time.
358
Coral snake bite
358
neuropathy.
The bite delivered by
an Eastern coral snake to
this dog caused a paralysis of
the left cranial nerve VII, as
shown by the lip droop. Coral
snake venom contains a
 neurotoxin and a hemotoxin,
which causes lower motor
neuron paralysis and hemolysis
in dogs.
359a, b Methylene blue
359a
hemolysis
(Also shown in Hematology
section, case 122,p. 103). This
 male Siamese cat was being
treated with methylene blue-
 containing medication for his
urinary disorder. Shown are the
cat's blue stained mucous
membranes (359a) and a
microscopic image of Heinz
body formation on the red
blood cells (359b) that caused
359b
 the hemolytic anemia typical of
 methylene blue intoxication in
the cat. It is for these reasons
that methylene blue should not
be given to cats.
255
Toxicologic disorders
360
360 Iron intoxication. This
Schnauzer ingested a container
filled with iron tablets that the
 owner was using as a
supplement. The immediate
oral administration of
 magnesium hydroxide
prevented the absorption of
the iron from the dog's GI
tract, thus sparing it from life-
threatening iron toxicosis.
361
361  Water moccasin
(cottonmouth) bite to the paw.
This dog's paw was struck by a
water moccasin, which is a pit
viper with a very harmful
venom. The hemorrhagic
lymphedema is typical, although
the bite site is not. Seventy per
cent of the dogs in Florida are
bitten in the face in this author's
experience. Although the venom
from a water mocassin can kill
a dog, it is not as potent as the
venom from an Eastern
diamondback rattlesnake.
362a
 362a, b Organophosphate
intoxication.
This kitten presented with signs
of pronounced neuromuscular
weakness characterized by
collapse following minimal
exercise, as shown in the
illustrations. This was caused by
exposure to OP insecticides
that were deposited as a house
362b
spray. This nicotinic sign was
 the only abnormality present in
 this patient. There is no specific
antidote for this form of OP
intoxication. Some sources
have recommended the use of
 diphenhydramine, but the
proven scientific basis of this
treatment is lacking. Time by
itself and removal of the toxic
256
substance from the
environment can lead to
eventual recovery.
Toxicologic disorders
363a, b Organophosphate
363a
intoxication.
 This puppy was treated for
sarcoptic mange with an
 organophosphate (OP) acaricidal
 preparation that was supposed to
be safe' for puppies. However, 
soon after the diluted solution
was applied, the puppy
experienced most of the
 muscurinic signs of
organophosphate intoxication
 including vomiting, hyper-
salivation, and diarrhea. These
were followed by the nicotinic
363b
signs of tremors, weakness, and,
eventually, generalized seizures.
Emergency treatment consisted
of bathing the dip residue from
the puppy and administering the
antidotes atropine sulfate and
pralidoxime chloride. Supportive
treatment consisted of
intravenous fluids and diazepam.
Shown is the puppy at the time
of admission (363a) and after its
successful treatment (363b).
364 Lye burn.
364
The severe caustic injury
involving the oral cavity mucosa
 Of this German Shepherd Dog
was likely caused by lye (sodium
hydroxide) that was
 surreptitiously given to the dog
while it was in the owner's back
yard. Esophagoscopy and
gastroscopy are important
evaluation procedures with this
type of injury in order to assess
 any ulcer formation involving
the esophagus and stomach.
These procedures will also
enable insertion of either an
esophagostomy or a gastroscopy
tube to allow for essential
 nutritional support.

 Most regions of the world have
their own indigenous
 population of venomous
 snakes and the interesting
medical problems that result
from envenomation. This
 Florida cat was bitten on
its lateral thorax (common
target for the cat) by an Eastern
diamondback rattlesnake.
 Shown is the typical soft tissue
 hemorrhage (365a) and the bite
marks that occur (365b). Cats
are commonly bitten on the
lateral and ventral trunk
365b
because of the way they spring
backward and upward when the
snake strikes.

This Boxer (366a,) was
envenomated by a 6 foot
Eastern diamondback
rattlesnake. The systemic
 hypotension, local hemorrhagic
 lymphedema, and somnolence
are common signs. The bite
occurred on the left side of the
face and the persistent bleeding
is due to the hypofibrino-
 genolysis that occurs with this
particular snake.

The sago palm (368a, b) is
 indigenous to Florida and other

the seeds found in the fruit can
cause severe vomiting and liver
necrosis when they are ingested
by a dog. Treatment is
 supportive, consisting of milk
thistle, SAMe, nutrition, and 
368c
parenteral fluids if needed. An

 Zinc intoxication.
369a
Metallic zinc intoxication can
occur in pets that ingest coins

signs in the dog are mainly a
hemolytic anemia that will
respond following removal of
the coin from the GI tract. The
Poodle shown (369a) presented
for hemolytic anemia and the
diagnosis of zinc-induced
hemolysis was made after the
 abdominal radiograph was

371 Septic shock.
371
The marked hypoperfused

The intraosseus route of
 parenteral fluid therapy is very
effective for delivering fluids to
a critically ill patient when a
vein cannot be isolated for
 cannulation. A 20 gauge needle
can be used effectively as a
bone marrow needle in very
small patients, such as this
kitten. It is important to make
a small skin incision with
a scalpel blade before inserting 
the needle in order to avoid skin
 plugging the needle opening.

375 Burn injury.
375
Iatrogenic skin burns
are commonly caused by
 hospital warming devices that
are used to maintain normal 
 body temperatures. Lying on
 these pads for too long a time
can cause combined pressure
and temperature-related skin
tissue injury and eventually
 major tissue sloughing.
 The dorsal region of this
dog will eventually slough
 most of the skin and
require extensive repair
with skin grafting.
376a-c
 Burn injury.
376a
 This Schnauzer was trapped in a
house fire and suffered facial
mucosal and extensive burns
involving its trunk. At the time
of admission the extent of such
burns might not be appreciated,
but with time the heat injured
skin will marginate and slough.
 In this case, meticulous surgical
management allowed for
 complete healing.

 Burn injury.
377
This dog suffered extensive lateral
torso burns after being struck
 by an automobile and being
dragged while trapped beneath
the muffler. The initial main
threats to this dog are fluid
balance and protein loss and
bacterial infection. The uncapped
 jugular vein catheter is a medical
management mistake, as it serves
 as a portal for bacterial
contamination and possible sepsis.
 The surgical repair procedures
will entail numerous skin grafts,
topical pig skin, and, perhaps,
 correction of any adhesions that
might restrict the range of
motion of the right forelimb.

 Burn and smoke
378a
378b
injury.
The hair of this cat has
been singed from having been
too close to the flames in a
burning apartment (378a).
Other lesions included burn
ulcers involving the paws and
exposed mucous membranes
and pulmonary smoke
 inhalation. Close watch must be
kept on these patients for
 secondary complications such as
 bacterial pneumonia and acute
respiratory distress syndrome.
Thoracic radiographs are
 advised initially and 3-5 days 
later in order to detect severe
378c
378d
hng pathology such as
a secondary pneumonia.
The radiographs shown
are from a different cat that
 experienced a similar insult. On
day 1 (378b) the lungs had no
infiltrate, but on day 5 (378c) the
infiltrate was diffuse, which led
to the cat's demise. At necropsy
this second cat had diffuse and

383a, b  Craniomandibular
osteopathy.
 This young Cairn Terrier (383a)
 is severely painful from the
early stage of craniomandibular
 Osteopathy. If caught early, this
 author has stopped its
progression using long-term
prednisone at a starting dose of
1.0 mg/kg per day and then 
 slowly tapering to where a dose
is given on alternate days until
383b
approximately one year of age.
The radiograph (383b) shows
another dog with the advanced 
stage of this disease. This is the
stage prednisone treatment will
 prevent from occuring.

 Chylous peritoneum.
These three large bottles
 of chylous abdominal effusion
(386b) were drained from the
abdomen of a miniature
Schnauzer (386a). The cause
was never determined in this
dog, but it can result from blunt
abdominal trauma, tearing of
the lymphatics, congenital
malformations, and various
causes of lymphatic
obstruction. Periodic repeated
drainage procedures on an out-
patient basis became necessary
for this dog. The owner
declined the offer for a surgical
exploratory.

hypothyroidism, primary
hyperlipidemic disorders,
and others.

Hyperlipidemia.
391
This lipid-dense serum sample
was from a severely
hypothyroid dog. Further
 diagnostic tests such as
cholesterol measurement and
lipoprotein electrophoresis will
further define the nature of the
 problem. This same
phenomena can occur in any
normal dog if serum is taken
soon after the ingestion of a

393a-d Fire ant bites.
 In the southern part of the
 United States, puppies and 
kittens can become victims to
fire ant (Solenopsis invicta)
envenomation. A massive
swarm can even kill the victim.
If it survives, the typical skin 
lesion is initially papular (393a)
and it then converts to a pustule 
 as shown in images 393b-d.
(See also case 9, p. 19.)
Treatment is supportive,
consisting of intravenous
crystalloid, glucocorticoid, and
antihistamine drugs. Also seen

osteodystrophy.
This syndrome affects young
dogs and can cause severe
debilitation because of
 accompanying fever, pain, and
inability to use the affected
limb(s) (394a, b). Metaphyseal
osteolysis is a typical
radiographic feature of this
disease (394c, d). Dietary
oversupplementation is thought
to contribute to its occurrence.
There are reports describing
bacteria playing a role in this
syndrome, similar to
osteomyelitis, with some
cases being responsive to
antibiotic treatment.

 Skin slough.
 Subcutaneous isotonic fluid
administration over the scapula
predisposed this Doberman
 Pinscher puppy to substantial
tissue loss. A large deposited
volume can compromise the
blood supply in the
hypodermis, leading to skin
necrosis and slough.
396
396   Hypocalcemia.
The general seizure in this cat
was caused by acute
hypocalcemia that occurred
after it received a hypertonic
 enema solution containing
 sodium and phosphorus for its 
obstipation condition. These
hypertonic enema preparations
are contraindicated in small
animals, and in particular in 
those with chronic renal
insufficiency, because of the
hypocalcemia and
 hyperphosphatemia that can
occur if the solution is allowed
to be absorbed through the
 colonic mucosa, which will 
certainly occur with obstipation.
397 Hypocalcemia:
397
eclampsia.
 Paraparturient hypocalcemia
usually occurs postpartum and
 is common is small breed dogs.
This Poodle is showing signs of
tetany. It was reversed with a
slow intravenous infusion of
10% calcium gluconate solution
(1-1.5 ml/kg) over a 30 minute
time period.

398a, b  Hypokalemic
398a
398b
 myopathy.
 Both cats and dogs can
have severe muscle weakness
with hypokalemia. The
weak neck muscles are typical
and result from the
hyperpolarized muscle cell 
membranes caused by the
hypokalemia. This cat
 had hypokalemia with
diabetic ketoacidosis (398a).
Treatment initially was with
intravenous fluids with added
potassium chloride before
beginning insulin treatment.
This would prevent further
lowering of the serum
 potassium level by insulin by
 moving it into the intracellular
space. This condition will
respond to potassium
 replacement treatment, in
addition to treatment for
 the primary underlying
disease (398b).
399a-c
Hypokalemic
399a
399b
myopathy.
The marked cervical
muscle weakness in this Poodle
was caused by hypokalemia that
occurred from excessive doses
of desoxycorticosterone pivilate.
The dog had Addison's disease,
but was only glucocorticoid
deficient. Shown are images of
the dog while it was
hypokalemic (399a, b) and after
399c
the serum potassium level had
returned to normal (399c)

400a-c Splenosis.
 Sometimes, ectopic splenic
 tissue is discovered during
a laparotomy. It is usually due to
fragments of spleen that are
 broken off the organ because
of a previous trauma. Shown is 
the spleen (400a), the splenic
fragment (400b), and the site
where the fragmentation
occurred (400c).

402a-c Pansteatitis.
402a
 Feline pansteatitis (also known
 as yellow fat disease) is a painful 
inflammatory syndrome
involving body fat deposits
caused by the ingestion of
 rancid fats found in poor
quality tuna. This cat is painful
 and anxious and resisted being
handled (402a). The
radiographs (402b, c) show
diminished fat radiographic
density and loss of abdominal
contrast as a result of the
inflamed abdominal fat. There
is also a pleural effusion caused
by the steatitis, which worsens 
the prognosis. The effusion
 characterizes as a sterile exudate
402b
with a neutrophilic
 predominance.

Vitamin E and prednisone were
used to treat these cats, along
with diet change. The diagnosis
can be more easily reached by
simply taking a biopsy of the
subcutaneous fat, thus sparing
403b
these patients any added insult.

404a-c
Polyarthritis.
Inflammatory polyarthritis
in the dog is probably due to an
immune-mediated process. It 
can have both erosive and
 nonerosive types. The
radiographs of the tarsus
(404a, b) show soft tissue
swelling and severe
joint destruction causing bone
subluxation and a loss of
the interarticular spaces.
The radiograph of the carpus 
(404c) shows osteophyte
formation and some collapse of
 the intercarpal spaces.

 Immune polyarthropathy in this
 Irish Setter was accompanied
by a diffuse painful joint
swelling (405a, b) and fever as
high as 40.5°℃ (105°F).
The radiograph of the carpus
(405c) shows periarticular soft
tissue swelling with
preservation of the carpal
interspaces. The arthrocentesis
sample was watery and
serosanguineous (405d); the
joint fluid cytology was
 predominantly neutrophilic
(405e). Diagnostic tests should
first eliminate a possible
 infectious origin before treating
405c

with any type of
 immunosuppressive drugs.

406a, b
 Thiamine deficiency.
406a
The blank gaze (406b) and
cervical flexion seizures (406a)
are characteristic of brain
dysfunction from thiamine
deficiency in the cat. Other
 signs include ataxia and
dementia. Certain thiaminase-
containing fish diets can cause
this condition, but prolonged
thiamine deprivation can also
cause this deficiency state and
syndrome. Early treatment can
 be curative, while delayed or no
 treatment can have severe
consequences. Thiamine
hydrochloride injection should
406b
only be given IM or SC, because
it is anaphylactogenic when
administered by IV push.
 407  Thiamine deficiency.
407
Cats are very susceptible
to thiamine deficiency because
they have high dietary
requirements and there are no
body stores for this vitamin.
This cat (407) shows the
characteristic demented stare
with mid-dilated pupils before
treatment. Clinical signs and an
index of suspicion form the
 most practical basis for making
this clinical diagnosis.
284
Miscellaneous disorders
408a, b
Vasculitis.
408a
408b
The petechiations in this cat
were caused by vasculitis that
 occurred as an adverse drug
reaction to vincristine. The cat's
platelet count was normal.
Fever was also present. Skin
biopsies were taken in order to
confirm the diagnosis. The cat
responded to glucocorticoid
treatment and discontinuation
of the vincristine treatment.
409a, b Hypoglycemia.
409a
Anorectic pediatric patients are
particularly prone to
hypoglycemia and associated
weakness and mental
depression, as shown in this
Maltese puppy (409a). Its
response to an intravenous
bolus of dextrose solution 
(0.25-0.5 g/kg) was immediate
(409b). Care must be taken to
avoid overdosing the dextrose
solution because excess
amounts can cause life-
threatening hyperosmolality,
 with accompanying adverse
effects on the brain.
