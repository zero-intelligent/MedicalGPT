SUTURE NEEDLES
Suture needlesareused tointroduce suture materialinto tissues.They come inavariety
of sizes,shapes,and thicknesses;the particular one chosen is determined by the type of
tissue tobe sutured and type of suture material tobeused.
Half-CircleTaper-PointSutureNeedle
INSTRUMENT
(Ferguson)
FUNCTION
To suture organsandvessels.
CHARACTERISTICS
This needle isround from point to eye.The rationale is to select
suture material the same size in diameterasthe needle.When
the needleispushed through the tissue,the suture material fills
theresultinghole.Thisreduces trauma to the tissue and helpsto
prevent leakageif the organ orvessel happens to have a lumen.
These needles are available in/-and%-inch diameters.Sizes
start at2,thelargest,and decreasebyincrementsof2;20isthe

Surgical instruments are designedto correctphysical problems thatrequire surgery.

Beforeusing new instruments,it isimportant to take the time to inspecteach one
toascertain that it is in good shape.Thatway,ifone is defective,it can be sentback
to the company for an exchange orrefund.Any instrumentthat doesnot meet the

shouldnotbepossible to turn the needle with one'sfingers.
Soiled instrumentsmustbe cleaned assoon aspossible after use.Within 10 minutes,

Thiscauses the instrument to become stained,pitted,orrusty.If instruments cannot
be cleaned within that time frame, they should bekept moist by being placed in a wet
towel;however,they should notbe soaked,because thatonlyhastens the breakdown
ofinstruments.
with cleanser.Cleaning detergents and solutions must have a pH of 7 to 8.5and must
be diluted properly toprevent instrument breakdown.All the instruments in a pack
are tobe cleaned,even if they have not been used.
The scrubbrushesused should be designed specifically for medical instruments.
Too hard a bristle can cause damage and fail toget into the cracks and crevices that
exist in individual instruments.The instruments should beopened and placed inthe
cleaning solution.Each instrumentmustbescrubbed,withattention to thegrooves
in thejaws,the boxlocks,and thejoints.Then they should be rinsed in water and dried
thoroughly,again with attention to the boxlocks and joints.The moving parts,such as
joints,boxlocks,and ratchets,should belubricated,using a lubricant that is specially
designed for surgical instruments and issteam penetrable.
An ultrasoniccleanerprovidesrapid and thorough cleaning of an instrument.
It works by producing bubbles that implode against the instrument,“blasting” the
debrisfrom the surface.Thisactioncleans the instrument in placeswhere brushes
cannot reach.Before using this type of cleaner,all the instruments should be divided
intotwo groups:sharp and nonsharp.Then they should be separated according to
typeof material,such asbrass,stainless steel,and so forth.All ratchets should be
opened,and any instrument designed to be taken apart should be separated.
The instruments areplaced in therack provided,without overfilling it.The cleaner
be specifically designed for an ultrasonic cleaner.The timer is set for 10 to 15minutes.
The tray should be removed promptly once the timer has gone off,and the instruments
should berinsed thoroughly with water,then carefully dried and lubricated.
Many elements contribute to the breakdown of instruments.The top three are tap
water,surgical wraps,and moisture.Bylearning about them,it ispossible to prevent
quality instruments from becoming stained,pitted,orrusted.
An improper water source for an autoclave can be an instrument killer.Tap water
contains minerals that,when vaporized,become concentrated and form layers on an
CHAPTER23·Careof Instruments711
712
instrument.As the instrument dries,the minerals cause pitting and corrosion.
An autoclave should alwaysbe filledwith distilled watertoprevent thebuildup
ofminerals.If an autoclave is supplied by a direct line,it is important to check the
owner'smanual forinstructions on cleaning the steam-line filter.
Surgical wraps also cause instrument breakdown.Most detergents are alkaline-based
andmostwashingmachinesdonotrinsewellenough toremove themetallicionsthat
remain in materials.Theinstruments are wrapped in these fabrics and placed in an
autoclave thatproducessteam,whichvaporizes these metallicions and deposits them
onto the surgical instruments.For thisreason,an autoclave should be cleaned on a
weekly basis to prevent the buildup of minerals andmetallic ions.Also,surgical wraps
shouldbe sent through tworinse cycles.It isalsoadvisable to avoidoverloading the
washing machinewhencleaning surgicalwraps.
Moisture also damages instruments.Moisture damage can occur if the autoclave
isnot allowed to go through the drying cycle and if theinstruments arenot allowed
to dry on a rackbefore being put away.Both of these practices cause the wrapped
packages to develop condensation,which notonly contaminates the packbutalso
causes the instruments to rust or corrode.Soaking instrumentsin cold-sterilization
solutions for extendedperiods also causesrust unless arust-prohibitor solution is
being used.
