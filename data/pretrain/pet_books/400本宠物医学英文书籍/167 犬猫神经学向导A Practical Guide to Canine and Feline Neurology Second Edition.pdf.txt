DEDICATION
KennethR.Pate,MD
1958-2003
My brother-in-law, Ken, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2001. Of all the people affected by this diagnosis,
Kenhandleditbetter than anyone,stating thatifhewere aNeanderthal,hewould alreadybeconsideredanold
man at 43. Although he stolidly accepted what was happening to him, Ken fought to stay among us. The cancer
that was projected to remove him from our midst within 6 months took 2 years to do so. Ken was brilliant,
kind, compassonate, articulate, and extremely brave. Ken strengthened his bonds with his family following his
diagnosis and,in so doing,brought everyone in his family closer together.Ken taught me the valuable lesson that
the peoplein our lives are farmore important than any of our plans or aspirations.When I forget this lesson
(which happens more often than I would like to admit), I think of Ken and redirect myself. We who knew and
loved Ken miss him fervently and remember him fondly. Ken is pictured here with his beloved cat Waldo, who
went to heaven before him.Ken's smile always made me smile in return. I hope it does the same for you.

PREFACE
Fortunately,A Practical Guide to Canine and Feline Neurology has become a well-recognized andrespected
textbook in our profession in the 5 years since the publication of the first edition.The second edition retains the
same intent and organizational approach as the first, but there have been extensive modifcations and additions.
After deciding to assemble a second edition, I knew that I needed to create something better than the first,
not just update sections with new information and new references. To make the second edition better, I had to
critically evaluate the first edition and decide where I thought the“holes”were. I had initially rejected the idea of
an extensive all-cncompassing breed table because I did not want readers to depend upon it, and such tables
necessarily change over time. I thought about it for a while and decided that I had been wrong. Breed tables can
be useful guides, and they can be updated in subsequent editions. After this epiphany, I added a few more tables
throughoutthetext.
Although I still feel that neuroanatomy is best “digested” when presented in a clinical contexr and that too
muchneuroanatomic detail can sometimes be overwhelmingto thereader,I decided that the second edition
nceded to have a bit more depth in this area. This has, I think, been accomplished with a number of new
illustrations, short descriptive sections in the neuroanatomy chapter, and (cspecially) the inclusion of Dr. Thomas
Fletcher's beautiful color atlas of canine brain anatomy and its accompanying index of terminology.
other chapters. I also came to the conclusion that this edition should have more images, especially more MR
images, than the first edition. If you fip through the book, especially the encephalopathy chapter, you will fnd
quite a few new figures that are an amalgamation of cases I have had over the years and cases from colleagues who
have been kind enough to provide some of their case material.
I was surprised and more than a bit discouraged at the magnitude of new information regarding canine and
feline neurology that had amassed since the first edition. Don't get me wrong—I think that it is fantastic that our
knowledge base is expanding so rapidly, and I am very proud of those individuals responsible for this expansion.
Sitting down and summarizing all of this new knowledge can be very daunting, however. I hope that you will
agree that this new edition isvery current and offers a good overview of most of the information available
regarding canine and feline neurology.As before,I have attempted toprovide fairly cxhaustivereference sections
to guide the reader to additional resources, if necessary.
A lot of people have told me how rmuch they liked the first edition of A Practical Guide to Canine and Feline
Neurology. This affirmation from my peers (and by peers, I mean everyone in my profession) of an effort into
which I really put my heart means a lot to me, especially now that I have reassumed the role of teacher. I think
that the second edition is much better than the frst, and I hope you willthink so as well. But don't worry about
me becoming complacentI am already looking for more “holes" to fill for the next edition.

SIGNALMENT, HISTORY, AND THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
THE FIRST CONSIDERATION
Curtis W. Dewey
Kerry S. Bailey
Introduction
When presented with a patient that is suspected of having a neurologic disorder, the signalment (i.e., breed,
age, and sex) and history are ofen helpful in guiding the clinician toward the most likely diagnosis. It is
important to recognize, however, that this information is adjunctive to the neurologic examination. Properly
weighting the importance of signalment and history will help avoid “tunnel vision" when devising diagnostic
plans and implementing treatment strategies.
II.
Signalment1235
The information in Table 1.1 provides a summary of suspected and confirmed breed predilections for
various ncurologic disorders. Knowledge of breed predilections can be very helpfil when considering
diffrential diagnoscs, cspecially for uncormmon presentations (e.g., ncuropathies in juvenile patients). The
clinician should be aware of the limitations of breed predilection tables, however. Newly discovcred or
ndiscovered breed predilections will not necessarily be rcpresented in a table. In othcr words, brccd prcdi
lection tables tend to increase in sizc with succcssivc tcxtbook edirions. Also, breeds other than those
reporredly predisposed to a particular disorder may occasionally be affected by that disorder. Finally, certain
rare disorders nay have only one or a few memhers of a certain breed reported in the literature. Since some
of these disorders are inherited (eg., lysosomal storage diseases), it may be asumed tha the breed is at risk,
despite low numbers of actually confirmed cases of the disorder.
Cerrain discase categories tend to be more likely with specifc age groups. In general, neoplasia (e.g.
brain rumor) is more common in older patients. Congeniral disorders (c.g., hydrocephalus) are more
commonly encountered in juvenile patients. As with other aspects of patient signalment, therc arc no
absolutes in regard to age for thc various neurologic disorders encountered in clinical practice. Some con-
genital disorders tend to cause clinical dysfuncrion in adult patients (e.g, caudal occipital malformarion
po esu ea) sd  u r aed sre sdo s pe (s
spinal cord).
There are very few neurologic disorders that are more common in one sex than the other. However, one
example would be muscular dystrophy in Golden Rerrievers, an X-linked heritable disease.
Hlistory
Obtaining a concise and accurate medical history as it pertains to a specific neurologic complaint is often
crucial to guiding the diagnostic plan. It is important to allow the pet owner to elaborate on pcrtinent
historical derails; it is equally important to dissuade the pet owner from delving into historical derails that
have lirtle or nothing to do with the chief clinical complaint. For example, an intricate account of events
concerning a cranial cruciate ligament repair from 10 years ago is unlikely to be of value in a patient that
presents for head pressing and generalized scizure activity. Alternatively, pet owners often omit pertinent
historical details. A pet owner may not necessarily think, for instance, that a change in the sound of their
seek medical advicc. Although definitely related to the chief complaint, dysphonia may be rcgardcd by thc

disease. Ischemic/vascular and traumatic disorders tend to have peracute onsets (within minutes to a few
hours) and often progress minimally or not at all after the initial 24 hours of onset of clinical signs. Infam-
matory/infectious disorders tend to have acute onsets (hours to days) with fairly rapid progression if not
aggressively treated. Neoplastic and degenerative disorders often display insidious onset of clinical dysfunc-
tion (days to several months) with slower progresson of clinical signs. Some degenerative disorders (e.g,
type II disk disease) may progress slowly over several years. Many anomalous disorders are characterized by
static disease courses-that is, the clinical abnormality is recognizcd at a young age, and the disease is non-
progressive. Finally, there are some neurologic disorders thar are typically episodic in nature, such as idio-
in ranking the likelihood of differential diagnoses for a specific patient, but it should be considered as a
rough guideline only. There are numerous and notable exceptions to the expectations outlined above. For
example, spinal lymphoma in cats is characterized by acute onset of clinical signs.
II.
The Differential Diagnosis ("Rule-Out")List6
Once inforimation regarding signalment and history is collected, it is combined with results of the neuro-
logic exarnination (see Chapter 3) to develop a list of potential disease processes that may explain the
patient's clinical signs of dysfunction. Although this list of differential diagnoses should be ranked from
most likely to least likely, it isvery important that all the disease categories that could explain the patient's
clinical signs be discussed with the client. In order to facilitate both the thought processes behind gcnerating
a differential diagnosis list and discussing these possibilities with pet owners, the authors prefer to use the
DAMNIT scheme (Table 1.2). There are some disorders that may fit into more than one category of this
scheme (e.g., intervertebral disk extrusion could be considered cither degenerative or traumatic), and which
category is chosen for such disorders is up to clinician preference. The clinician should focus discussions on
the most likely disorder or disorders, but omitting other possibilities may lead to unnecessary and emotion-
ally stressful “surprises” for the pet owner. For example, although a 4-year-old Golden Retriever dog with
recent onsct of generalized seizure activity most likely has epilepsy, thepossibility of abrain tumor should
be discussed with the owner prior to acministering imaging tests.Alternatively, the possibility of late-onset
idiopathic epilepsy in an 8-year-old Golden Retriever dog with recent onset of generalized seizures should be
discussed with the owner in addition to the more probable diagnosis of a brain tumor.
As with signalment and history information, the differential diagnosis list should be used as a guide in
planning a diagnostic approach and an. eventual treatment plan.

Introduction
Mastering canine and feline neuroanatomy is a formidable task. The complexity of the subject matter often
Although understanding clinical neurology depends upon a worlking knowledge of neuroanatomy, an
functional neuroanatomy necessary to understand the neurologic cxamination (discussed in Chaprcr 3) and
to interpret clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction. Normal functions of specific areas of the nervous
system, as well as clinical signs of dysfunction, are described concurrently.
II.
The Brain
The brain includes the cerebrum, the brain stem, and the cerebellum (Fig. 2.1). The brain stem includes the
diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus), the midbrain (mesenccphalon), the pons (ventral metencephalon),
and the medulla oblongata (myelencephalon). Although the diencephalon is technically the rostral-most
aspect of the brain stem, it is functionally (and dysfunctionally) more similar to the cerebrum than the
remainder of the brain stem (midbrain through medulla). In this text, the term forebrain will be used to
describe the combination of cerebrum and diencephalon. The cerebellum (dorsal metencephalon) is the final
brain subdivision and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. The upper motor neurons originate
from various regions of the brain.The term upper motor neuron (UMN) refers to the neurons of the brain
that control motor activity of the body. The UMNs exert their effects by stimulating or inhibiting the
neurons that directly innervate the muscles. The actual neurons that innervate the muscles arc lower motor
  N  (   n  T  , N  s   (N) 
responsible for (1) initiation of voluntary movement, (2) maintenance of muscle tone for support against
 gravity, and (3) the regulation of posture. The UMN systerm is often divided into pyramidal (mainly located
in the motor area of the cerebral cortex) and extrapyramidal (mainly located in the brain stem nuclei)
neurons. In primates, the pyramidal system plays a very important role in control over the LMN and thus
cats. Gait is generated in the brain stem of dogs and cats. The exact location of the brain stem center for
 gait generation in dogs and cats is unknown, but the midbrain is thought to play a major rolc.
1. Functional regions of the cerebrum may be conceptually divided into lobes (Fig. 2.4). These include
frontal lobe (motor area-origin of corticospinal and corticonuclear tracts); parietal lobe (somatosen-
sory area or somesthetic areareceives afferent conscious proprioceptive and nociceptive informa
tion); temporal lobe (receives afferent input from both auditory and vestibular systems); occipital
lobe (termination of optic tract fibers for visual interpretation); and pyriform lobe (termination of
olfactory tract axons for perception of smell). This is an oversimplification (e.g., the motor area of
the cerebral cortex is actually partially represented in the parietal lobe as well as frontal lobe), but it
is often helpful in understanding cerebral function or dysfunction in the clinical patient. In addition
to these general functions, the cerebrum is the seat of consciousness and is important for cognition,
interpretation of afferent input, and memory.

2.The descending tracts to the limbs (corticospinal tracts) are mainly (about 75%) contralateral (Fig.
2.5) and are located primarily in the dorsolateral funiculus of the spinal cord (lateral corticospinal
tract). Similarly,cerebral cortical influence over cranial nerve nuclei (corticonuclear or corticobulbar
tracts) is predominantly contralateral. These cerebral cortical tracts are of minor importance in dogs
and cats, compared with humans. However, damage to cerebral cortical neurons or their associated
white matter tracts may result in subtle, contralateral hemiparesis.
3.Conscious proprioception (position sense),tactile sensation,and some nociception (face)are
represented in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Conscious proprioception refers to position
sense as perceived at the cerebral level.The modality of conscious proprioception is conveyed to the
cerebrum primarily via the dorsal column/medial lemniscus pathways (e.g., fasciculus cuneatus for
thoracic limb, spinomedullary tract for pelvic limb; Fig. 2.6) and is best evaluated with the animal
in a standing position (i.e., proprioceptive positioning; see Chapter 3). Note that some texts attri-
bute the sense of pelvic limb conscious proprioception to the fasciculus gracilis and associated
nucleus gracilis. There is evidence that the fasciculus gracilis conveys primarily discriminative
touch perception, whereas the spinomedullary tract (whose afferent axons synapse on nucleus Z,
rostromedial to the nucleus gracilis) is responsible for conveying the modality of conscious
proprioception.
4.
The combination of conscious proprioceptive deficits (usually contralateral to a cerebral lesion) with
a normal or near-normal gait is a hallmark of cerebral dysfunction.
5.Lesions of the cerebrum often cause behavior change, altered mental status (e.g., obtundation),
seizure activity, walking in wide circles (usually in the direction of the lesion), head-pressing,
and menace deficits. The deficits in the menace response are primarily contralateral.
Contralateral deficits of facial sensation may also be appreciated (see the note in the discussion of the
pons).

Note: Patients with structural lesions of the cerebrum occasionally exhibit anisocoria, which may be subtle.
They may also exhibit mild facial muscle paresis, often demonstrated best by observing asymmetry of the lip
commissures with the patient's nose held in a vertical position.The cerebral cortex normally has a facilatory
infuence over the contralateral facial nucleus and an inhibitory infuence over the contralateral parasympa-
thetic oculomotor nucleus.Therefore, a unilateral cerebral lesion may cause contralateral miosis (disinhibition
of the oculomotor nucleus) and contralateral facial paresis.
6. Patients with structural disease (e.g., tumors) of the cerebrum, or any area of the brain, may exhibit
neck pain. This phenomenon is thought to be due to factors such as meningcal stretching and
referred pain.It is important for the clinician to recognize that structural brain disease can cause
neck pain and that this clinical finding does not necessarily indicate multifocal or diffuse disease
(i.e., another lesion in the cervical spinal cord area).
7.Hemi-inattention syndrome, or hemineglect syndrome, refers to a phenomenon in which a patient with
a structural forebrain lesion ignores input from one-half of his or her environment. Since most

Signs of dysfunction are often similar to those associated with cerebral disease.In fact, all of the
clinical signs of dysfunction listed above for cerebral diseasc may be observed in patients with

dicncephalic disease (see Table 2.1). One fairly consistent feature of patients with diencephalic
disease is that they often will circle to either side. If a patient alternates to which side he/she circles,
based either on hospital observation or owner-supplied history, this may point to a diencephalic
lesionversus a cerebral lesion.
2. Patients with diencephalic dysfunction may also exhibit evidence of endocrine dysfunction (e.g,
polyuriapolydipsia), abnrmal eating paterns, and problems with tmeraure regulationUcm
monly, animals with diencephalic disease will show nonspecific pain (thalamic syndrome).Absence
of these signs does not rule out a diencephalic lesion, however.
3. The optic nerves or their relays with lateral geniculate nuclei may be affected, resulting in visual
impairment and deficient menace responses.
4.Large lesions of the diencephalon may produce stupor and coma as the diencephalon is part of the
ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) projecting to the cerebral cortex. The ARAS is respon-
sible for maintaining the awake state in normal animals.
5. Although uncommon, peracute and acute diencephalon and midbrain lesions may cause a head tilt.
(See Chapter 5.)
Note: The sensory modality of vision (Fig. 2.8) is carried by the optic nerves (CN II),which are associated
with the forebrain (cerebrum and diencephalon).Axons of the optic nerve arise from the ganglion neurons of
the retina. The majority of axons in each optic nerve carrying visual information for cerebral cortical recogni-
tion cross to the opposite side at the level of the optic chiasm (65% crossing in the cat, 75% in the dog).
These axons then synapse on neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the diencephalon. These
24
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
LGNneurons,in turn,relay information to the occipital area of the cerebral cortexfor theperception of sight.
Focal lesions of the diencephalon and/or cerebrum may result in menace response deficits that are primarily
contralateral to the lesion. It is important to note that the menace rcsponse involves cerebral cortical integra-
tion and interpretation and therefore is not a reflex.The pupillary light reflex (PLR) involves optic nerve axons
not destined for cerebral cortical recognition and is discussed in section (II.C) concerning the midbrain.

1.Lesions from the midbrain through the medulla are more likely to produce severe disturbances of
consciousness (stupor, coma) due to impairment of the ARAS.
2.Lesions from the midbrain through the medulla typically cause obvious gait abnormalities (UMN
paresis or plegia). These may be unilateral or bilateral, depending on the size and rate of develop
ment of the lesion. On each side of the midbrain,ventrolateral to the mesencephalic aqueduct, is a
collection of neurons called the red nucleus. Each red nucleus gives rise to axons that cross the
midline and become the rubrospinal tract (Fig. 2.10). The rubrospinal tracts are thought to be
important in gait generation in dogs and cats.If the midbrain lesion is focal cnough (unlikely due to
the small size of the midbrain),an ipsilateral (caudal midbrain) or contralateral (rostral midbrain)
hemiparesis with postural reaction deficits may predominate. The anatomic landmark for focal
lesions that will produce ipsilateral gait and postural reaction deficits appears to be in the vicinity of
the caudal midbrain and rostral pons. Lesions rostral to the midbrain cause contralateral postural
reaction deficits and mild or inapparent contralateral paresis. Midbrain lesions seen in clinical
practice are often large enough that the signs are bilateral and sevcre (e.g., decerebrate rigidity in
brainstem herniation).
3.The oculomotor nuclei (motor to extraocular muscles and parasympathetic to pupil) and trochlear
nuclei are located in the midbrain. Axons from these nuclei comprise cranial nerves (CN) II and IV,
respectively. Cranial nerves II and IV indent and traverse across the cavernous sinus at the base of
the brain. Other cranial nerves that traverse through the connective tissue overlying this sinus
include the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of CN V (from the pons) and CN VI (from the

medulla). Cavernous sinus syndromc refers to dysfunction of more than one of these aforementioned
cranial nerves. In addition to thcsc cranial nerves, the sympathetic pathway to the eye courses in the
vicinity of the cavernous sinus fora short distancebefore exiring through the orbitalfssure with the
ophthalmic branch of CN V. Therefore,Horner's syndromc may also occur with lesions in the
region of the cavernous sinus.
4. The origin of the tectotegmentospinal tract (sympathetic innervation of the eye) is in the midbrain
(tectum refers to the dorsal aspect or roof of the midbrain; tegmentum refers to the body of the
midbrain). The diencephalon has inffuence over this part of the midbrain.
Note: Axons of CN II that are involved in reflex activity (rather than cerebral cortical recognition) do
not synapse at the level of the LGN of the diencephalon (Fig. 2.8). Those axons involved in the PLR
to the opposite side and synapse on neurons of the parasympathetic oculormotor nucleus (CN Il). These
latter neurons give rise to the parasympathetic portion of the oculomotor nerve, which mediates pupillary
constriction. Since there are two levels of crossing in this pathway (chiasm level and pretectal level), the
direct PLR (pupillary constriction on the side in which the light is shone) tends to be a bit stronger than the
indirect (pupillary constriction on the opposite side in which the light is shone). The other reflex pathway
for CN II axons also involves the midbrain. Some of the axons that bypass the IGN will synapse on neurons
in the rostral colliculus, located in the roof (tectum) of the midbrain.These neurons project to various areas
of the brain stem to mediate reflex movements of the eyes, neck, head, and limbs in response to visual
stimuli.

(Fig. 2.12).
3.The major respiratory centers are located in the pons and medulla (mainly), so abnormal respiratory
activity may be apparent with damage to the pons.
Note: Sensory information from the face (Fig. 2.13) travels to the brain via branches of the trigeminal nerve
within the petrous temporal bone of the skull. Once these axons traverse thc trigeminal canal of the petrous
termporal bone to reach the brain stem, they form the sensory tract of CN V, which extends from. the midbrain
level,through the remainder of the brain stem,to reach the most cranial aspect of the cervical spinal cord.
Medial to the spinal tract of CN V is the nucleus of the spinal tract of CN V. The axons of the spinal tract of
CN V synapse somatotopically on this nucleus. The neurons from this nucleus (second-order neurons) project
axons to neurons of the contralateral thalamus (quintothalamic tract). These thalamic third-order neurons ther
project axons to the cerebral cortex for conscious recognition. Brain stem lesions caudal to the diencephalon
therefore may lead to ipsilateral deficits in facial sensation, whereas forebrain lesions produce contralateral
deficits.

1.The nuclei of CN VI (abducent nerve); VII (facial nerve); IX (glossopharyngeal nerve); X (vagus
nerve); XI (accessory nerve); and XII (hypoglossal nerve) are located in the medulla, so dysfunction
of one or more of these cranial nerves (discussed in Chapter 3) may be evident.
2.This is also the location of the vestibular nuclei (rostral,medial,caudal,lateral).The functional
neuroanatomy associated with the vestibular system is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.
3.Lesions of the medulla can cause alterations of consciousness,respiratory disturbance,and autonomic
dysfunction (heart rate and blood pressure).
4. Axons from the medullary reticular formation give rise to the medullary reticulospinal tracts (Fig.
2.12). Damage to the medulla often results in UMN paresis/plegia from interference with these and
other UMN tracts from the brain stem.
5. Abnormal respiration is possible, since the major respiratory centers are located in the medulla The
neurons of the medullary respiratory centers can be thought of as the UMNs of respiration, which
send axons to the LMNs. The LMNs for respiration are located in the gray matter of the caudal
cervical (CCC7-phrenic nerve) and thoracic (intercostal nerves) spinal cord segments.
Note:Connections between the extraocular nuclei (III,IV,VI) and vestibular input (VIII) are essential for
appropriate ocular movements when the head moves. The connections are maintained by a tract in the brain
stem called themedial longitudinal fasciculus(MLF).

1.The cercbellum does not initiate movement.It coordinates and regulates the rate and range of
movement by acting as a comparator. Lesions here tend to cause exaggerated movements (e.g
hypermetria).
 2. Lesions of the cerebellum can cause ataxia (unconscious proprioceptive loss) without paresis.
3.Intention tremors, which are tremors initiated by a voluntary movement (e.g., reaching for a treat)
may occur and are often most notable in the head region.
4.
There are direct connections of the cerebellum with the vestibular system, so evidence of vestibular
dysfunction may accompany cerebellar disease.

responsible for this phenomenon is unknown.

Cerebellar lesions may also lead to anisocoria. In this scenario, the abnormal pupil is dilated with a
sluggish pupillary light refex. Other associated ocular abnormalities (in addition to mydriasis) may
include a widened palpebral fissure and protrusion of the third eyelid. These ocular abnormalities
can be either ipsilateral (interpositus nucleus) or contralateral (fastigial nucleus) to the lesion.
Note: Innervation of the striated muscle of the larynx, pharynx, and esophagus is provided by neurons in the
nucleus ambiguus (Fig. 2.15). This is a large, poorly demarcated nucleus in the ventrolateral medulla contain-
ing somatic motor neuron contributions to cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), and XI (accessory).
All of these cranial nerves exit the skull via the tympanooccipital fissure. The nucleus ambiguus fibers in the
glossopharyngeal nerve primarily innervate pharyngeal muscles. The nucleus ambiguus fibers in the vagus
nerve have a variable distribution. Some leave the vagus nerve shortly after its emergence from the skull to
either innervate pharyngeal, palatal, and cervical esophageal musculature, and some axons form the cranial

laryngeal nerve that innervates the cricothyroid niuscle of the larynx.Theremainder of thevagal somatic
cfferents travel with somatic efferents from the nucleus ambiguus contributions to the accessory nerve
(internal branch of CN XI) distally in the vagosympathetic trunk in the neck. At the level of the aortic arch
and right subclavian arteries, these axons leave thc vagosympathetic trunk to form the left and right recurrent
laryngeal nerves, respectively. The recurrent laryngeal nerves ascend the neck region close to the trachea. The
recurrent laryngeal nerves innervate the entire esophagus (striated musculature), as well as the remainder of the
laryngeal musculature (inchuding the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis, which is necessary for inspiratory function).
The external branch of CN Xl is of minimal clinical importance. Axons of this external branch are not
supplied by the nucleus ambiguus, but by neuronal cellbodies in the lateral region of the ventral gray
column (motor nucleus of the accessory nerve) from the cervical spinal cord segments (up to the C6 or C7
segment).Axons from these neurons leave the cord laterally and ascend in the external branch of CN XI
This branch enters the cranial vault and briefy joins the internal branch from which it separates before exiting
the skull as the only contribution to CN XI as it cmerges from the tympanooccipital fissure. The external
branch of CN XI innervates the trapezius muscle and parts of the sternocephalicus and brachiocephalicus
rmuscles.
I11.  The Spinal Cord .9,11,16,17,19,28,33.36
With the exception of the first one or two cervical scgments and a few segments at the thoracolumbar
junction level, most spinal cord segments are positioned cranial in the vertebral canal relative to the vertebra
of the same number (Fig. 2.16). In medium- to large-breed dogs, the spinal cord terminates at the L6-L7
vertebral level.In small-breed dogs,this spatial relationshipis shifted caudally by one-half to one vertebral
segment. The termination of the spinal cord in cats is usually over the body of S1.
The spinal cord white matter is conceptually divided into dorsal, lateral, and ventral funiculi (Fig. 2.17)
The axons or tracts of brain UMNs descend through the spinal cord, synapsing on lower motor neurons of
the spinal cord gray matter. The UMN tracts, mainly facilitory to limb exor muscles and inhibitory to
extensors, are located in lateral funiculi of the cord (corticospinal, rubrospinal, medullary reticulospinal).
Those facilitory to limb extensors and inhibitory to flexors are located in the ventral funiculus (pontinc
reticulospinal, vestibulospinal). Ascending sensory tracts for proprioception (spinocerebellar tracts, spino-
tract) are located mainly in the dorsal and lateral funiculi (Fig. 2.18). Interference of the UMN infuence
over the LMN (ie., the upper motor neuron lesion) typically results in a “release” of muscle inhibition
(disinhibition), usually more apparent in the extensor muscles.The resulr is paresis with normal to increased
reflex activity and increased extensor muscle tone. Occasionally, a patient is encountered with decreased
muscle tone (hypotonia) and intact reflexes; this may represent a relatively greater disturbance to UMN
facilitory pathways versus inhibitory pathways. The reffex activity is at least normal if not hyperactive
because the reflex arc is not affected by the UMN lesion. ensory pathways travel cranially up the spinal
cord to the brain mainly in dorsal and lateral funiculi. Conscious proprioception is represented in thc
contralateral cerebral cortex, and unconscious proprioception (spinocerebellar tracts) is mainly ipsilateral.
Pain sensation is functionally bilateral. Although the terminal spinal cord segments are technically part of
the spinal cord, they also supply the nerve roots of the cauda equina. In this text, the cauda equina will be
defined as the nerve roots derived from the cord segments L7 and caudally.
It is vitally important to understand that pain perception means cerebral cortical recognition and
response to a noxious stimulus. The withdrawal refex is not pain perception. The patient must show some
behavioral response to the noxious stimulus (e.g, vocalization, attempting to bite) for pain perception to be
judged intact.
The spinal cord is divided conceptually into segments, primarily based upon the location of LMNs
supplying appendicular (limb) musculature. Although there are LMNs throughout the length of the spinal

cord, the LMNs of clinical importance are those supplying the limbs and urinary bladder, as well as anal
and urethral sphincters. The LMNs of clinical importance are located in the cervical intumescence
(C6-T2 segments) and the lumbosacral intumescence (L4-S3 segments) of the spinal cord. Damage to
these segments will cause LMN paresis or plegia, characterized by weak to absent reflexes and decreased tone
in the associated muscle groups (Fig. 2.19). Damage to areas of the cord without LMNs of clinical signifi-
cance (C1-C5 and T3-L3) will interrupt descending UMN control over the LMNs, leading to UMN
paresis or plegia. With UMN paresis/plegia, refexes and muscle tone will remain either normal or be
exaggerated.

1. This area of the spinal cord can be divided into cranial (C1-C5) and caudal (C6-T2) cord seg-
ments. Lesions in this area of the spinal cord can cause hemiparesis, hemiplegia, tetraparesis, or
tetraplegia. Some patients exhibit neck pain only, with no proprioceptive or motor deficits.The
clinical signs depend both on the location (i.e., unilateral, dorsal, ventral) and the extent of the
lesion.
2.C1-C5 lesions should cause UMN signs to the thoracic limbs and pelvic limbs; C6-T2 lesions can
cause LMN signs in thoracic limbs (if involving the gray matter of C6-T2) and UMN signs in the
pelviclimbs.

Note: Thc sympathetic inncrvation to the eye (lig. 2.20) continues from the synapses at T1-T3 (thc pregan-
glionic nuclei), The axons of thcse nuclei join the vagosympathetic trunk in the dorsal thorax, travel up the
neck with the vagosympathetic. trunk, and leave the trunk near the base of the skull to synapse in the cranial
cervical ganglion. Axons from these postganglionic neurons project from here through the tyinpanooccipital

fissure, subsequently travel through the petrous temporal bone in the vicinity of the middle ear cavity, and exit
the skull as components of the ophthalmic nerve, a branch of the trigeminal (CN V). The pathway followed
by the postganglionic sympathetic axons in the petrous temporal bone is not well-defined, but does not appear
to involve these axons directly entering the middle ear cavity as commonly believed.Nonetheless, disorders
involving the middle ear (e.g., otitis media/interna) do tend to involve this pathway, so there is likely very little
tissue physically dividing these sympathetic fibers from the middle ear cavity. Another important point is that,
as these postganglionic sympathetic axons pass through the petrous temporal bone, they follow a brief intracra-
nial course before joining the ophthalmic branch of CN V and exiting the skull through the orbital fissure.So,
from the level of the cranial cervical ganglion, postganglionic sympathetic axons to the eye are initially extra-
cranial,then intracranial,and then extracranial.Horner's syndrome(ptosis,miosis,enophthalmos)can be

B. Thoracolumbar spinal cord (T3-L3)4.15.34
1. This area of the spinal cord can be conceptually divided into T3-L3 segments.
2. The thoracic limbs are neurologically normal. T3-L3 lesions cause signs of UMN dysfunction in the
pelvic limbs.
3. Border cells in the dorsolateral border of the ventral grey column of L1-L7 (mainly L2-L4) are
neurons that project to the cervical intumescence, providing tonic inhibitory activity to muscles of
the thoracic limbs. Disruption of these neurons or their ascending processes can result in disinhibi-
tion, usually manifested as thoracic limb extensor rigidity. This posture is known as the Schiff-
Sherrington phenomenon (Fig. 2.21). It is important to note that a patient with Schiff-Sherrington
posture has normally functioning thoracic limbs that have increased extensor tone (most readily
appreciated when in lateral recumbency). The two most common clinical errors made when this
phenomenon is encountered are (1) to incorrectly assume a C1-C5 lesion based on the increased
thoracic limb extensor tone and (2) to assume a poor prognosis based on the presence of Schiff-
Sherrington posture; this is a anatomic phenomenon and does not connote anything regarding
prognosis for return to function.
4. Lesions of this area of the spinal cord may result in a “UMN bladder” (see Chapter 13).
C. Lumbosacral and caudal spinal cord (L4Cd5)1,15,193,34
1.This section of the spinal cord comprises the L4-caudal (Cd) segments. Lesions anywhere along this
large area will lead to signs of LMN dysfunction. Because lesions in particular areas of this large
region can lead to distinctively different types of neurologic dysfunction, there is some clinical utility
in dividing this area into L4-L6, L7-S3, and caudal (Cd1-Cd5) segments.
a.L4-L6 lesions cause signs of LMN dysfunction in the pelvic limbs, as the neurons in these
segments give rise to the femoral nerve. Decreased to absent patellar reflexes and intact to
42
A PRACTICALGUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
diminished withdrawal and gastrocnemius refexes may be observed. The L6 spinal segment
contributes to the sciatic nerve (L6, L7, S1, variable S2), so decreased withdrawal and gastrocne-
mius rcflexes are also possible.
b. Lesions primarily of the L7-S3 area of the spinal cord cause signs of LMN dysfunction in
distriburion sites of sciatic (decrcascd to absent withdrawal and gastrocnemius reflexes); pudendal
(decreased to absent perineai [aual] reflex, poor anal tone); and pelvic (atonic LMN bladder)
nerves. Patellar refexes may appear hyperactive if the sciaric nervc or its contributing cell bodies
tive lumbosacral stenosis). The quadriceps muscle group is usually opposed by the caudal thigh
muscles; the latter tend to dampen the parellar rcflex (they cause stife fexion) in the normal dog
and cat.
C. The terminal spinal cord scgments are referred to as caudal or coccygeal segments (Cd1-Cd5).
These segments contain the LMNs supplying tail muscularurc, so their dysfunction is manifested
by paresis or plegia of the tail.
IV.The Peripheral Nervous Systen
This neuroanatomic localization includes peripheral nerve, skeletal muscle, and neuromuscular junction
(NMJ). Neuronopathies are diseases in which premature degeneration of neuronal cell bodies occurs. Since
dogs and cats with neuronopathies display clinical signs similar to or indistinguishable from animals with
of this category are not as common as brain and spinal cord disorders, they are not rare as a group. Many of
these disorders have a diffuse disribution (e.g, polyradiculoncuritis), whereas others may appear relatively
and spinal cord problems. Ir may be difficult to distinguish neuropathy from myopathy from neurormuscular
junction disorders. This is not of major importance, as the diagnostic tests used to furthcr characterize al of
these disorders are similar. Refer to Table 2.4 for clinical signs of peripheral nervous system dysfiunction.
A. Periphcral nervel1.29
1. Thcre are often reduced or absent reflexes, with variable proprioceptive deficits.
2. There is often rcduced or absent muscle tone.
3.Depending on the specifc disorder, there is a variable distribution of deficits; both mononeuropa-
thies and polyneuropathics arc possible (see Chaptet 14).
4.
Neurogenic muscle atrophy is common. This is rapidly developing muscle atrophy (over 1-2 weeks)
due to disruption of nerve supply to the muscle.
5. It may be difficult to discern peripheral nerve disorders from some NMJ disorders.
B. Skeletal muscle3.21.39
1. Spinal refexes and proprioccption are usually normal.
2. Generalized weakness is frcquently evident, often with exercise intolerance.
 3. There is usually a bilaterally symmetrical distribution of clinical signs (see Chapter 15 for specific
myopathies)
4. Muscle pain on palpation (myalgia) may be appreciated with some myoparhics
C. Neuromuscular junction*6
1.Clinical signs of weakness are due to interference of nerve-muscle communication at the levcl of the
ncuromuscular juniction (see Chapter 16).
2. Refexcs may be normal, depressed, or absent, depending on the specific disorder and severity.
 3. There is a rendency for diffuse distribution of signs.
4.Exercise intolcrance may be noted.

V.
Anatomy of the Spinal Reflexes
In the normal animal, spinal reflexes operate under the influence of descending UMN influence from the
brain. However, spinal refexes remain intact, somctimes even exaggerated, if UMN infuence is attenuated
or abolishcd. An extreme example of this concept is spinal walking. Occasionally, weeks to months after a
complete transection injury to the T3-L3 region of the spinal cord in a dog or cat, the patient will develop
rhythmic walking movements in the pelvic limbs. The walking movements are due to coordinated refex
patterns that develop within the spinal cord, without any input to or information from UMNs. This
"walking” can be induced by stimulating the patient's pelvic limbs and sometimes by stimulating nearby
areas (e.g., tail, perineum). These animals have no deep pain perception (nociception) to the pclvic limbs,
and the pelvic limb movements are not coordinated with the thoracic limbs.7 The following is a simplifed
description of the anatomy involved in withdrawal and tendon (stretch) reflexes.
A.Withdrawal reflex3s
1. The withdrawal reflex is a coordinated polysynaptic reflex in which all the fexor muscles of a limb
contract in response to a noxious stimulus.
2.During the withdrawal reflex, alpha motor neurons to the limb fexor muscles are stimulated, while
those to extensor muscles are inhibited. This phenomcnon is called reciprocal innervation.
3. The force and duration of the withdrawal refex are proportional to the intensity of the noxious
stimulus applied.
B.Tendon (stretch) reflex35.38
1. The stretch refex (e.g, patellar reflex) is primarily a monosynaptic refex. Afferent axons from a
muscle stretch receptor directly synapse with spinal cord alpha motor neurons, which cause contrac-
tion of that saime muscle (Fig. 2.22).
2. The stretch receptor for the tendon reflex is a structure called the muscle spindle, located deep
within the main muscle belly. The muscle spindle contains specialized muscle fibers called intrafusal
fibers, which are arranged in parallel with the main muscle (extrafusal) fbers.
3. The intrafusal muscle fibers of the muscle spindle are made up of polar contractile cnds and a
central, noncontractile region. Sensory endings of Ia afferent axons contact the central regions of the
intrafusal fibers. When the central region is stretched (i.e., striking the tendon), action potentials are
generated in the la axons. The Ia axons enter the spinal cord synapsing with and exciting alpha
motor neurons innervating the extrafusal muscle fibers. Collaterals of Ia axons within the spinal cord
also excite Ia inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons synapse with, and decrease activity of,
alpha motor neurons that inncrvate antagonistic muscle groups. When the muscle contracts, the
central region of the intrafusal fbers relaxes, decreasing the firing rate of Ia axons.
4.The sensitivity of the muscle spindle can be altered by UMN input to gamma motor neurons.
Gamma motor neurons are excitatory neurons that directly innervate thc contractile ends of intra-
fusal muscle fibers. UMN excitation or inhibition of gamma motor neurons can increase or decrease
respectively, sensitivity of the muscle spindle to stretch.
5. The duration and force of muscle contraction associated with a tendon reflex is mitigated to some
sensory nerve endings intertwined with collagen fibers at the musculotendinous junction. These
sensory nerve endings give rise to a Ib afferent axon.The sensory endings are sensitive to muscle
tension, increasing their firing rate when the muscle contracts. The Ib afferent axon stimulates a
spinal cord Ib inhibitory intcrneuron, which inhibits the alpha motor neuron, causing the muscle
contraction.

6. It has been demonstrated that older dogs (>10 years old) are significantly more likely to lose their
patellar reflex in one or both legs, in the absence of any other sign of neurologic disease,than
younger (<10 years old) dogs. This is considered to be an age-related phenomenon, rather than an
indication of spinal cord disease. Hypotheses for this age-related finding include degeneration/
atrophy of extrafusal muscle fibers, degeneration of intrafusal muscle fibers (responsible for the
afferent impulse propagation via Ia afferents), and degenerative changes of the lumbar spinal nerves.
The finding of decreased to absent patellar reflexes in anolder dog should be considerednormal in
the absence of any other signs of neurologic dysfunction.
VI. The Autonomic Nervous System and Associated Visceral Functions,10,12-24,30.40
The anatomical andfunctional complexity of the autonomicnervous system often causes clinical evidence
of its dysfunction to be misunderstood or ignored. A basic understanding of this .involuntary “visceral”
system and associated structures is more than sufficient for clinical application. Because the autonomic
function and dysfunction associated with pupillary size and bladder control are discussed in detail clsewhere
in this text, they will not be mentioned here.The autonomic nervous system is functionally and structurally
divided into parasympathetic (cholinergic) and sympathetic (adrenergic) systems. Because the preganglionic
neurons of the parasympathetic system are found primarily in the brain stem and sacral spinal cord, this
system is sometimesreferred to as thecraniosacral componentof the autonomicnervous system.The
46

preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system arc found primarily in the thoracic and lunbar
spinal cord (approximately 11--L5 segments), which cxplains why this aspcct of the autonomic nervous
system is called the thoracolumbar componcnt. Although orgaus are generally innervated by both systems,
sympathctic output is the controlling influencc facilitating cardiac output and blood pressure; parasympa-
(e.g., lacrimation, salivation) function. Ir should be noted that the gastrointesrinal tract has its own intrinsic
and somewhat autonomous nervous system. Although a gross oversimplification, the sympathetic nervous
system has been referred to as the fight-or-flight division of thc autonomic nervous system, with the para-
sympathetic system occupying the role of the resz-and-digest division.As with other functional divisions of
the nervous system, the autonomic nervous sysrem normally maintains a state of visceral homeostatic
cquilibrium by adjusting efferent output in accordance with afferent inpur,
A,Afferent input
In general, afferent input from the periphery to brain steim centers for autonomic control are transmitted via
the solitary tract (ST) in the medulla oblongata (Fig. 2.23). This sensory tract is organized sinilarly to the
the solitary tract (NST). Aferents from the peripheral nerves (CNs VII, IX, and X) travel to the ST and
synapse on neurons in the NST. These neurons will subsequently synapse either on brain sterm or spinal
cord centers for involuntary visceral functions (see section B, Efferent output) or project to the thalamus for
conscious perception (solitariothalamic tract). The ST conveys information regarding blood pressure and
tissue oxygenation levels from baroreceptors and chemoreceptors in largc arteries (e.g., carotid, aortic arch)
via CNs IX and X and the modality of taste from gustatory nerves via CNs VIl (CN V in the periphery):
autonomic responses to smells and emotional reactions, respectively. Refex functions associated with the
viscera also involve afferent input into the solitary tract.
Visceral pain does not appear to be primarily represented in the ST. Rather, this mode of visceral
sensation travels retrograde via sympathetic nerves (Fig. 2.24). Once at the spinal cord level, this visceral
nociceptive pathway follows a route similar to that for somatic pain perception (spinothalamic tract), At the
dorsal horn level of the spinal cord, there are interneurons that receive input from both visceral and somalic
afferent nerves. In essence, these interneuron relays for pain scnsation are shared by somatic and visceral
structures; this anatomic organization may be a possible explanation for the clinical phenomenon of referred
pain.
B.Efferent ourput.
The hypothalamus infucnces both parasympathetic and sympathetic output centers in the medulla oblou-
gata, with che rostral hypothalamus facilitating parasympathetic output and the caudal hypothalamus
facilitating sympathetic output. The hyporhalarus probably plays an integrative role in autouomic responses
rather than providing the primary efferent output for thcsce responses.
Both parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent systems consist of a two-neuron pathway, with a pregan-
intermcdiolateral grey substance of the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. The axons of these ncurons Icave
via ventral rootlets, join the spinal nervc of that cord segment, and then travel ro synapsc in a ganglion (the
postganglionic neuron) via one of three routes: a sympathetic chain ganglion along the lateral aspect of the
vertebral column; splanchnic nerves ro a visceral ganglion in the thoracic or abdominal cavities (e.g, celiac,
cranial, and caudal mesenteric ganglia); or the adrenal medulla, which is structurally and functionaly a large
collection of postganglionic sympathetic neurons. With some notable exceptions (e.g., adrenal medulla),
preganglionic sympathetic axons synapse some distance from the ultimate target organ or structure. In
contrast, preganglionic parasympathetic neurons generally have long axonal processes that synapse on
there are three clinically important parasympathelic nuclei that contain the preganglionic neurons that

project to parasympathetic ganglia to regions other than those associated with bladder function, the para-
sympathetic nuclei of CNs VII, IX, and X (Fig. 2.25). (This topic is covered in detail in Chapter 13.) These
parasympathetic nuclei are located dorsolateral to their somatic motor counterparts. This is an important
distinction to make, especially for CNs IX and X. The parasympathetic nuclei of CNs IX and X are struc-
turally and functionally distinct from those neurons found in the nucleus ambiguus. In some texts, the
parasympathetic nuclei of CNs Vll and IX are referred to as rostral and caudal salivatory nuclei, respectively.
The parasympathetic nucleus of CN X, or the parasympathetic nucleus of the vagus nerve, is referred to in
some texts as the dorsal vagal nucleus. The parasympathetic nucleus of the facial nerve (VIl) supplies
preganglionic axonal input to the pterygopalatine ganglion as well as the mandibular and sublingual ganglia.

Postganglionic axons from the pterygopalatine ganglion join the maxillary branch of CN V to supply the
lacrimal glands,nasal glands, and palatine glands.Postganglionic axons from the mandibular and sublingual
ganglia join the mandibular branch of CN V to supply the mandibular and sublingual salivary glands,
respectively. Preganglionic input to the otic ganglion is provided by the parasympathetic nuclcus of the
glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Postganglionic fibers from the otic ganglion join the mandibular branch of
CNV to innervate parotid and zygomatic salivary glands.The parasympathetic nucleus of the vagus nerve
(CN X) provides parasympathetic input to the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal smooth muscle and glands, as
well as several other organs (e.g, galbladder, pancreas, liver, etc.). The postganglionic neurons are located
near orwithin theorgansbeinginnervated.

C. Blood pressure control and the Cushing response
Although the preceding discussion concerning autonomic functions should provide adequate understanding
for application to clinical situations, one further level of complexity needs to be added to explain the
interrelationships between the brain and blood pressure. (Specific information regarding intracranial pressure
dynamics can be found in Chapter 6 and will not be discussed here.) The sympathetic outflow from the
preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral gray column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord is the main
driving force for maintaining normal blood pressure, as well as increasing systemic blood pressure as needed.
The parasympathetic system plays a comparatively minor role in affecting vascular tone. The thoracolumbar
sympathetic efferents are innervated and driven by higher brain centers, most importantly a vasomotor
center in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The RVLM supplies constant facilatory input to the
spinal cord preganglionic sympathetic neurons and can be thought of as the UMN of the sympathetic
nervous system;these neuronshave also been referred to as presympathetic.A constant inhibitory infuence
to the RVLM is provided by a group of neurons in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). As discussed,
both baroreceptor and chemoreceptor afferents from the peripheral vasculature reach the medullary centers
via the ST and NST; however, there are some important differences in the organization of the medullary
pathways for these two modalities (Fig. 2.26). In situations of mild hypoxemia and/or hypercarbia, afferents
from chemoreceptors synapse on ncurons in the NST. These NST neurons then directly synapse on and
stimulate neurons of the RVML, increasing sympathetic outlow.Baroreceptor afferents also synapse on
neurons of the NST after joining the ST in the medulla; however, these afferents are stimulated by increased
systemic blood pressure. The NST neurons stimulated by baroreceptor afferents then synapse on and cxcite
neurons of the CVLM, which in turn provides inhibitory synaptic input to the neurons of the RVLM
region.Thus,hypoxemia will have a fairly direct stimulatory effct on increasing medullary sympathetic
outflow, whereas hypotension will have a more indirect, disinhibiting method of causing increased medul-
lary sympathetic outfow (via decreasing baroreceptor input to the tonically inhibitory CVLM region). In
addition to these peripheral inputs to the RVLM, the neurons of the RVLM also are able to directly sense
and respond (by increasing sympathetic outflow to the periphery) to local brain ischemia/hypoxemia. In
such ischemic situations, RVLM neurons have also been shown to cause regional vasodilation in cerebral
arteries/arterioles in order to improve blood fow to the brain (mechanisms are unclear). This cerebral
ischemic response is a very effctive and powerful mechanism to increase blood ow to the brain by simulta-
neously incrcasing local blood fow via vasodilation of cerebral vessels and increasing systemic blood pressure

 and causing vasoconstriction in peripheral vascular beds (e.g., skin, muscle, mesentery) not cssential to
survival. In general, the chemoreceptor pathways for sympathetic excitation and the cerebral ischemic
response are more potent physiologic phenomena than the counterbalancing disinhibiting response from the
baroreceptor system. In addition, the baroreceptor pathway is more effective in influencing cardiovagal
responses to hypoxemia than in counterbalancing sympathetic elevations of vasomotor tone. These various
responses to brain ischemia help our understanding of the Cushing response. In cases of brain ischemia/
hypoxemia,it is common tohave the seemingly odd combination of systemic hypertension and bradycar-

diathe Cushing response. Although historically thought of as an invariably acute, typically fatal, “last-
ditch" physiological response to brain ischemia (which it can be, in head trauma patients for example), it
probably rcprescnts in many patients with more slowly progressive intracranial disease (e.g., intracranial
meningioima) a tonic resetting of the vasomotor tone via the mechanisms previously discussed.

Introduction
A thorough neurologic examination can be performed in 10 to 15 minutes.The main components are
evaluation of mental status and behavior, gait and postural reactions, cranial nerves, spinal refexes, palpa
tion, and pain perception. General observation of mental status, posture, atitude, and gait is peformed
while taking the history. Once the history is clarified, the remaindcr of the examination is completed. Based
on the presenting complaint, it may be necessary to modify portions of the examination. For cxample, a
patient with nonambulatory tetraplegia after being hit by a car is not subjected to postural reactions for fear
of exacerbating a posible unstable cervical injury. Start with procedures least likely to upset the patient.
Disagreeable or painful procedures, such as palpating painful areas, are left until the end of the examination.
If the clinician upsets the patient early on,it may be difficult to complete the examination.Also,once pain
isclicited,the patient will often anticipate further painful stimulimakingit difficult to determine if other
cxamination proceeds. This lessens the client's distress when he or she observes unfamiliar procedures
performed on a pet. Some abnormalities will be blatantly obvious, whereas others will be subtle. A subtle
abnormality is still an abnormality. There is a tendency for subtle abnormalities to be chalked up to any-
thing but a neurologic lesion; trust your neurologic findings.
11.
Tools forPerforming the Neurologic Examination
A pleximeter (rubber hammer) is used to test myotatic reflexes. Other instruments, such as scissors, are not
recommended because these do not provide a consistent stimulus and appear less professional to the client.
A hemostat is often useful when testing for nociception or eliciting a cutaneous trunci reflex. A strong light
source is necessary to elicit pupillary light reflexes in excited dogs and cats. Finally, a moistened cotton
tipped applicator stick is recommended for performing the corneal reflex. A light rouch with your fingertip
is acceptable, but if a client is watching you, it may appear that you are poking the pet in the eye.
I.Performing the Neurologic Examination-12
A.Mental status and behavior
1.Before handling the patient, let the animal have the run of the examination room, if ambulatory,
and observe its reaction to the surroundings.
2. Mental status should be evaluated both in terms of level and content of consciousness.

(2) Depressed/obtunded—the animal is drowsy but is able to be arousable. Depressed/obtunded
dogs and cats are typically inattentive and display little spontaneous activity.
(3) Stuporous--the patient is in a sleep state but arousable with a strong stimulus.
(4) Comatose--the patient is unconscious and cannot be aroused even with painful stimuli
b.Content of consciousness
(1) Content-refers to the quality of consciousness.
(2) Dementia/delirium-the patient has an alert level of consciousness, but it exhibits abnormal
behavior and responds inappropriately to stimuli.

A PRACTICAL GUIDETO CANINEAND FELINE NEUROLOGY
3. Abnormal behavior is identified by comparing the patient's behavior to expected bchavior for animals
of a similar breed and age. The client is often able to bring subtle changes in bchavior to rhe veteri-
narian's attention.
B. Attitude/posturc
1.Attitude refers to thc position of the eyes and head in relation to the body. Abnormal head position
is often manifested as a head tijr or a head turn. In a patient with a head tilt, one ear is held lower
than the other. Unilateral vestibular dysfunction will often cause a head tilt. When an animal
develops a head turn, the head is held level, but the nose is turned right or left. Animals with
forebrain lesions may tend to turn their heads and circle in one direction.
2. Posture is che position of the body with respect to gravity. Abnormal postures, such as a wide-hascd
stance, are common in dogs and cats with neurologic disease. Several classic abnormal postures
indicative of neurologic dysfunction have been described.
a.Dccerebrate rigidity ~due to a brain stem lesion and characterized by extension of all limbs and
somctimes opisthotonus (dorsifexion of the head and neck). A decreased level of consciousiess
(often stupor or coma) usually accompanies this posture.
b. Decerebellate rigidityduc to an acute cerebellar lesion and characterized by opisthotonus,
thoracic limb extension, and fexion of the hips. Consciousncss is not innpaired due to lack of
brain stem involvement.
C. Schiff-Sherrington posturefrequently encountered in veterinary practice and caused by a
Icsion in the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord scgments. Extension of the thoracic limbs (best
appreciared in lateral recumbency) with paralysis of the pelvic limbs characrcrizes Schiff-
Sherrington posture.
C. Gait
1. Lameness
a.Limb pain can cause a limp when the patient tries to bear weight on a painful limb and then
quickly plants the contralateral limb to relieve the pain. As a result, thc stride of the painful limb
is often shortened. When a single limb is severely painful, it is often carried, This is in contrast
t0 a paretic lirnb, which is often dragged. Lameness is usually caused by orthopedic discase, but
some neurologic lesions, such as attenuation or infammation of a nerve root or spinal nerve by
intcrvcrtebral disk extrusion or ferve sheath tuumor can cause lameness. This forim of lameness is
often refcrrcd to as a root signature.
   an p o  d se ns d q  m s 
walk at all or have short-strided, stilted gaits. This can mimic weakness due to neurologic
disease.
c.Lower motor neuron weakness cafi cause a short-strided gait in the affected limb(s)
2.Ataxia
Ataxia is the inability to perform normal, coordinated motor activity thar is not caused by
types.
a.Sensory ataxia
(1) Loss of the sense of limb and body position due to interruption of ascending proprioceprive
 pathways (primarily unconscious proprioception).
(2) Characterized by clumsiness and incoordination, resulting in. a widc-bascd stance and a
swaying gait. The stride of the affected limb(s) is often longer than normal, and the toes may
drag or scuff the ground.
(3) Caused by a lesion affecting the general proprioceprive pathways in the periphcral nerve,
dorsal root, spinal cord, and brainn stem.
3/ PERFORMINGTHENEUROLOGICEXAMINATION
55
b.Cerebellar ataxia
(1) Inability to regulate the rate and range of movement (unconscious proprioception).
(2) Characterized by dysmetria, especially hypermetria—an overreaching, high-stepping gait.
(3) Cerebellar ataxia is caused by cerebellar disease or selective dysfunction of spinocerebellar
tracts (less likely).
c.Vestibular ataxia
(1) Unilateral vestibular lesions cause leaning and falling to one side. Other signs of vestibular
disease, such as head tilt and abnormal nystagmus, may be evident.
(2) With bilateral vestibular dysfunction, the patient maintains a crouched position, is reluctant
to move, and exhibits side-to-side head movements.
3.Paresis/paralysis
Paresis is a partial loss of voluntary movement. This is manifested as a decreased rate or range of
imotion, increased fatigability, decreased muscle tone, or limited ability to perform certain motor
acts. Paralysis (plegia) is a complete loss of voluntary movement. Paresis or paralysis indicates a lesion
not possible to discriminate betwcen UMN weakness and LMN weakness based solely on the
scverity of the weakness.
4. Abnormal movements
a.Tremora rhythmical, oscillatory movement localized to one region of the body or generalized
to involve the entire body. A terminal tremor, or intention tremor, occurs as the body part nears
a target during goal-oriented movement. This is most evident as a head tremor when the patient
attempts to sniff an object, eat, or drink. A postural tremor occurs as the limb or head is main-
tained against gravity.
b.Myotonia-delayed relaxation of muscle following voluntary contraction. Myotonia is manifested
as muscle stiffness that is relicved by excrcise. Attacks of myotonia may culminate in rcumbency
with rigid extension of the limbs. Some patients with myotonia will display “dimpling” of
sustained indentation of affected muscle when percussed.
C.Myoclonus-a brief, shocklike muscle contraction producing a quick, jerking movement of a
body part.
D. Postural reactions
Postural reactions test the same neurologic pathways involved in gait, namely the proprioceptive and motot
systems. Their main value is detecting subtle deficits or inconspicuous asymmetry that may not be obvious
during the observation of gait. Postural reactions are also useful in discriminating between orthopedic and
neurologic disorders.
1. Proprioceptive positioning
sassposaod oe q n   
contact with the ground. The patient should immediately rerurn the foot to a normal position
(Fig. 3.1).
b. When properly supported, most patients with orthopedic disease will have normal proprioceptivc
positioning. On the other hand, proprioceptive pathways are often compromised carly in the
course of ncurologic diseases, so defects in proprioceptive positioning may be detected before
there are obvious signs of weakness.
2. Placing responsc
a.The nonvisual (tactile) test is performed first. Cover the patient's eyes, pick the animal up, and
move it toward the edge of a table. When the paw touches the table, the animal should immedi-
ately place the limb forward to rest the paw on the table surface (Fig. 3.2).
b.Visual placing is tested similarly, except thc patient's eyes are not covered.The normal response is
to place the paws on the surface as the table is approached, before the clinician allows the paws
to contact the table. This test may detect visual deficiencies.
56
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
Fig. 3.1.Proprioceptive positioning is evaluated with the animal supported in a standing position. The dorsal surface of
the paw is placed on the foor. The patient should immediatcly replace the foot to a normal position. (Illustration by Anton
Hoffman)
3.Hopping
a.
Hold the patient so that all of the patient's weight is supported by one limb and move the
animal forward or laterally (Fig. 3.3). Normal animals will hop on the limb while keeping the
foot under their body for support.
b. Each limb is tested individually, and responses on the left and right are compared. This is a
sensitive test for subtle weakness or asymmetry.
4.Hemiwalking and wheelbarrowing
a.
These tests can be performed if other postural reactions are equivocal, or in large dogs, when
eliciting the hopping response is physically diffcult for the examiner.
b.For hemiwalking, hold up the limbs on one side of the body and move the patient laterally
(Fig. 3.4). The normal reaction is as described for the hopping response.
C.
Wheelbarrowing in the thoracic limbs is done by supporing the patient under the abdomen
so that the pelvic limbs do not touch the ground and moving the patient forward
(Fig. 3.5). Normal animals will walk with symmetrical, alternate movements of the thoracic
limbs.
E. Cranial nerves (Fig. 3.6, Table 3.1)
1. CN I (olfactory nerve) is not routinely tested. After ascertaining patency of the nostrils, cover the
patient's eyes and present a morsel of food beneath the nose, observing for normal sniffing behavior.
3/PERFORMINGTHENEUROLOGICEXAMINATION
57
Fig. 3.2.Tactile placing is tested by covering the patient's eyes and moving the patient toward the edge of a table.Normal
animals will place their paws on the table as soon as they contact'the edge of the table.(Ilustration byAnton Hoffman)
Irritating substances, such as ammonia or isopropyl alcohol, should not be used because they stimu-
late trigeminal nerve endings in the nasal passages and produce false results.
2. CN II (optic nerve)
 a. Note pupillry size and any anisocoria. There should be a direct and consensual pupillry light
reflex in each eye (Fig. 3.7).
b.Menace response.Move your hand toward the patient's eyes in a threatening manner, observing
for a blink response (Fig. 3.8). By covering the contralateral eye, you can test the nasal (medial)
and temporal lateral)visual felds of each eye.The efferent part of this reaction is controlled by
the facial nucleus and nerve (CN VII). The menace response may be deficient in puppies and
kittens (less than 12 weeks).
c.Visual following. Drop cotton balls or move a toy or ball in front of the patient and observe if
the patient's eyes and head follow the object.
3. CN II (oculomotor nerve), IV (trochlear nerve), and VI (abducent nerve) are considered together
because they control eye movements. CN III also mediates pupillary constriction, which is evaluated
by the pupillary light reflex.
a.Strabismus may be obvious or can be detected by shining a light on the cornea.When the eyes
are aligned, the light reflection is on the same area in each eye.
b.
Observe spontaneous eye movements when the patient looks about. Move the patient's head
from side to side and up and down to induce horizontal and vertical nystagmus.

Fig. 3.3. The hopping response is tested by holding the animal such that most of the animal's weight is borne on one
limb.The patient is moved laterally. (Illustration by Anton Hoffman)
C. To induce the corneal reflex, touch the cornea with a cotton-tipped applicator moistened with
saline (Fig.3.9).Corneal sensation depends on the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.
The normal response is a retraction of the globe, mediated by the abducent nerve (CN VI).
4. CN V (trigeminal nerve)
a.Motorportion—The temporalis andmasseter muscles are visualized and palpated to detect any
swelling, atrophy, or asymmetry. If there is bilateral weaknes, the patient may notbe able t
close the mouth.
b. Sensory portion
(1) Ophthalmicbranch—This branch of CNVcanbeevaluatedvia the corneal refex(discussed
above) and by specifically touching the medial canthus of the eyelid region during the
palpebral refex. The efferent part of this refex depends on normal function of thc facial
nucleus and nerve (CN VII).
(2) Maxillary branch—-Pinch the upper lip lateral to the canine tooth. A normal response is a
wrinkling of the face and a blink, which also depends on motor supply by the facial nerve.
Some animals also turn or withdraw their head,indicating a conscious response mediated at
the level of the forebrain.
3/PERFORMINGTHENEUROLOGICEXAMINATION
59
Fig. 3.4.Hemiwalking is tested by lifting the limbs on one side and moving the patient laterally. (Illustration by Anton
Hoffman)
In patients who do not respond topinching the face,gentlyinsert the tip of a hemostat
into each nostril (Fig. 3.10). The normal response is to withdraw the head. The mucosa of
the inner nare is innervated by both maxillary and ophthalmic branches of CN V.
(3) Mandibular branch—Pinch the lower lip lateral to the canine tooth.The patient should show
a behavioral response.
5.CN VII (facial nerve)
a.Observe the patient's face for asymmetrical eyelid closure, a widened palpebral fissure, spontane-
ous blinking, or a drooping ear.
b.The ability to blink is tested by eliciting the palpebral refex (Fig. 3.11).
c.The facial nerve also mediates tearing, which is evaluated with Schirmer test strips.
6.CNVIII (vestibulocochlear)
a.Cochlear portion
(1) Alert patients should orient their head and ears toward a loud or unexpected noise, such as a
squeaky toy, whistle, or pager/beeper.

(2) The client may notice signs of subtle hearing loss. For example, the animal may sleep
soundly or not respond readily to being called.
b. Vestibular portion
(1) Signs of vestibular dysfunction include head tilt, abnormal nystagmus, and an ataxic, broad-
based stance.
(2) Physiologic nystagmus is elicited by rotating the paticnt's head. Normal physiologic nystag-
mus has a fast phase in the direction of the head rotation.
(3) Putting the head in different positions is done to elicit positional nystagmus or positional
strabismus (both are abnormal).
7. CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) and CN X (vagus nerve)
a.Ask the client about any dysphagia, regurgitation, voice change, or inspiratory stridor.
b. Touch the left or right side of the caudal pharyngeal wall with an applicator stick or finger and
watch for elevation of the palatc and contraction of the pharyngeal muscles, called the gag refex
(Fig. 3.12). An asymmetrical response is more significant than a bilateral loss of the gag reflex
because this reflex is dificult to elicit in some normal animals. If the patient's demeanor pre-
cludes stimulating the pharyngeal mucosa, a similar reflex may sometimes be elicited by exter-
nally palpating the pharyngeal region dorsal to the larynx.

the ipsilateral (direct pupillary light reflex) and contralateral pupil (indirect, or consensual pupillary light relex). (Illustration

8.CN XI (spinal accessory branch) supplies motor innervation to the trapezius muscle.A lesion in this
nerve results in atrophy of the trapezius muscle.However, this is difficult to detect in most patients,
and lesionsrestricted to thisnerve arerarelyrecognized.Theinternal branch of CNXIis structurally
and functionally part of CN X.
9. CN XII (hypoglossal nerve)
a.Inspect the tongue for atrophy, asymmetry, or deviation.
loss of innervation may be able to lick only one side of the nose, with the tongue usually deviat-
ing toward the side of the lesion when actively protruded.
c.Watching the patient drink water also helps assess tongue function.
F.Spinal reflexes
1.S
Spinal reflexes assess the integrity of the sensory and motor components of the reflex arc and the
infuence of descending UMN.motor pathways.
2. Reflexes are graded as follows:
a.Absent
b.Weak (present but reduced)
C.
Normal
d. Exaggerated
c.Clonus (repetitive fexion and extension of the joint in response to a single stimulus)
D川

3.Causes of weak or absent reflexes are as follows:
A lesion affecting any part of the reflex arc, including the peripheral nerve, nerve roots,
spinal segments, neuromuscular junction, and muscle. Other signs of weakness are usually
apparent.
b.Severe rigidity or muscle contraction that limits joint movement, such as fbrosis of a joint or
muscle.Absent muscle stretch refexes can also be seen in normal animals that are excited or
unable to relax. In these patients, other signs of LMN weakness are absent.
C.S
Spinal shock,which can occur immediately after severe spinal cordinjury.This is characterized
by paralysis and absent refexes caudal to the level of injury.In dogs and cats, spinal shock is
generally considered to be short-lived, with reflexes returning within about 30 minutes after
trauma. However, there is evidence that pelvic limb withdrawal reflexes may be decreased due to
spinal shock following a UMN spinal cord lesion for periods of 12-48 hours. In the authors
experience, this phenomenon occurs most frequently with ischemic/vascular diseases (e.g
fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy in dogs).
3/PERFORMINGTHENEUROLOGICEXAMINATION
65
Fig.3.11.The palpebral reflex is elicited by touching the skin either medial or lateral to the eye.Normally, this will
induce a blink.(Illustration by Anton Hoffman)
4. Causes of exaggerated reflexes or clonus are as follows:
a.A lesion in the UMN pathways cranial to the spinal segment involved in the reflex. Other signs
of UMN disease, such as paresis or paralysis, are also evident.
b. Patients who are excited or anxious. In this case, other signs of a UMN lesion are absent. Never
diagnose a UMN lesion in a patient with exaggerated refexes, but with normal gait and postural
reactions.
(pseudo-hyper-reflexia). This is due to decreased tone in the muscles that fex the stifle and
normally dampen stifle extension when the patellar reflex is elicited. Such lesions also cause other
abnormalities,such as a decreased fexor reflex.
5. Patellar reflex
 a.With the patient in lateral recumbency, place one hand under the thigh to support the limb with
the stife in a partially fexed position.With the other hand, briskly strike the patellar ligament
(located between the patella and tibial tuberosity) with a reflex hammer (Fig. 3.13).
b. The normal response is a single, quick extension of the stifle.
C.
The patellar reffex assesses the integrity of the femoral nerve and L4-L6 spinal cord segments.
d. As discussed in Chapter 2, unilateral or bilateral loss of the patellar reflex in older (more than 10
year old) dogs is a common nonspecific age-related phenomenon and is not necessarily indicative
of spinal cord disease.
6.Gastrocnemius reflex
a.Grasp the metatarsal area,extend the stifle,and fex the hock.Strike the common calcanean
tendon above the calcaneus (Fig. 3.14)
b.A normal response is contraction of the caudal thigh muscles.
C.
The recumbent leg tends to have a better response than the nonrecumbent leg.
d. The gastrocnemius refex assesses the integrity of the sciatic nerve and the L6-S2 spinal cord
segments (primarily L7, S1 segments).
e.
.The gastrocnemius reflex may be difficult to elicit in normal animals.

7.Biceps reflex
a. Grasp the antebrachium, extend the elbow (forelimb pulled caudally), and place your index
finger on the tendinous insertion of the biceps on the radius. Lightly tap the dorsum of your
finger (Fig. 3.15).
b.A normal response is contraction of the biceps brachii muscle.If this is diffcult to judge (e.g., in
a long-haired patient), let up with your left hand and observe for elbow fexion as you tap the
tendon.
C.
It is easier to test the recumbent leg.
d.The biceps refex assesses the integrity of themusculocutaneous nerve and the C6-C8 spinal
cord segments.
8. Triceps reflex
a.
Grasp the antebrachium, fex the elbow, and rotate the shoulder medially (inward), so that the
elbow joint is abducted.Strike the triceps tendon on themedial surface,above the olecranon
(Fig. 3.16).
b. A normal response is contraction of the triceps muscle mass.
C.
The triceps reflex assesses the integrity of the radial nerve and the C7-T2 spinal cord segments.
d. The triceps reflex may be difficult to elicit in normal animals.
9.Withdrawal(flexor)reflex
a.With the limb extended, pinch the interdigital skin lightly with your finger (Fig. 3.17).
b.The normal response is fexion of the hip, stifle, and hock (pelvic limb) and the shoulder, elbow,
and carpus (thoracic limb).

If pain perception is intact, this may also elicit a behavioral response.
d.Observe the contralateral limb for extension (crossed-extensor reflex).A crossed-extensor reflex is

e.
The withdrawal reflex assesses the integrity of spinal cord segments C6-T2 for the thoracic
limb and L6-S2 (primarily L7, S1) for the pelvic limb. The specific nerves that are assessed
depend upon the specific area of skin stimulated (see Chapter 14 for autonomous zones). The
efferent arc of the thoracic limbwithdrawal refex ismediated by the musculocutancous,axillary,
median, ulnar, and radial nerves. In the pelvic limb, the efferent arc is mediated by the sciatic
nerve.
10. Perineal (anal) reflex
a.Lightly touch or stroke the perineum (Fig. 3.18). Test the left and right sides.
b.The normal response is contraction of the anal sphincter and tail fexion.
c. The perineal refex assesses the integrity of sacral (S1-S3) and caudal (tail fexion) spinal cord
 segments, as well as perineal and caudal rectal nerve branches (both are branches of the pudendal
nerve).

11.Cutaneous trunci (panniculus)reflex
a.With the patient standing or in straight sternal recumbency, lightly pinch the skin just lateral to
the spine (Fig. 3.19). Start over the lumbosacral region and proceed cranially, one vertebral level
at a time.The opposite side is tested similarly.
b.The normal response is a bilateral contraction of the cutancous trunci muscle,resulting in a
twitch of the skin over the thorax and abdomen.This refex is present in the thoracolumbar
region and is absent in the neck and sacral regions.
C. An obvious cutoff point suggests a spinal cord lesion 1-4 cord segments cranial to level of the
cutoff.
d. A lesion affcting the brachial plexus may cause a loss of the ipsilateral cutaneous trunci refex
with a normal response on the other side, regardless of the level at which the skin is stimulatd.
The cutaneous trunci refex asscsses the integrity of the lateral thoracic nerve and C8-T1 spinal
e.
cord segments.
G. Palpation
1. Light palpation helps detect swelling or atrophy.
2. Deep palpation and manipulation detect painful regions. If crying, whimpering, or muscle tensing
occur on palpation, more vigorous maneuvers, such as manipulation,are unnecessary and may be
dangerous in patients with unstable fractures or luxations. Also, palpation is usually more specific
because manipulation of one region often produces movement in other areas.

the cutaneous trunci muscle,resulting in a twitch of the skin ovcr the thorax and abdomen.(Illustration by Anton Hoffman)
3.Head
a.Check the calvarium for masses, defects, or persistent fontanelles.
b. After palpating the muscles of mastication, gently open the mouth to detect pain or reduced
range of motion of the temporomandibular joints.
c.Retropulse the globe by gently pressing on the closed eyelids to detect pain or a retrobulbar
mass.
d. The authors have found that lightly squeezing the head by grasping above the zygomatic arch
often elicits a painful response in dogs and cats with structural brain disease (Fig. 3.20).
4.Spine
a.
Lightly palpate the spine to detect any curvature, displacement, atrophy, masses, or swelling.
b. Deeply palpate the paraspinal muscle for pain.
c.Palpate, extend, and fex the tail.
d.Downward pressure on the sacrum often elicits pain in animals with lumbosacral lesions.
e.When palpating the thoracolumbar spine, lightly place one hand on the abdomen to detect
tensing of the abdominal muscles as the affected area is palpated.
f.The spinous processes, articular processes, and transverse processcs or ribs are palpated separately.
g.If palpation is not painful, the spine can be gently manipulated by applying ventral and lateral
pressure to extend and fex the spine, respectively. To extend the lumbosacral joint, place one
hand under the pelvis while the animal is standing. Raise the pelvis and press downward on the
seventh lumbar vertebra with the other hand.
h. Cervical pain is often manifested by tensing of the cervical muscles and twitching of the ears
during palpation or manipulation.If palpation does not induce pain, gently extend and ex the

head with one hand while placing the other hand on the cervical muscles to detect muscle
tensing. Caudal neck pain can often be detected by gently rocking the large transverse processes
of the sixth cervical vertebra. A very sensitive method for detecting cervical pain is by gently
pushing aside the soft tissues of the ventral neck (trachea, esophagus, etc.) and pressing against
theventral aspect of the vertebral column while supporting the dorsal neckwith the opposite
hand (Fig. 3.21). The advantages of this technique are that subtle pain can be detected, presum-
ably by applying pressure more direcly to the problem area, and anatomic landmarks (e.g..
caudal ventral midline protuberances, lateral processes of C6) can be readily palpated.
5.Limbs
a. Limbs are initially palpated with the patient standing. Contralateral limbs are compared for
symmetry.
b.
The limbs are more closely examined with the animal in lateral recumbency, when the spinal
reflexes are tested.
C.
Palpate specific structures, not general regions. Carefully move overlying muscles to palpate bones
without compressing adjacent structures. Palpate muscles without compressing or moving
adjacent bones and joints.
H.Pain perception (nociception)
In addition to evaluating the patient for areas of hypersensitivity (hyperesthesia),it is important, especially
in nonambulatory patients, to determine whether noxious stimuli applied to the limbs are traversing the
3/PERFORMINGTHENEUROLOGICEXAMINATION

poses, nociception is divided into superficial and deep pain perception.
1. Superficial pain, also called fast pain, is sharp, well-localized pain most commonly originating in the
skin.
a.
With a hemostat,lift and grasp a small fold of skin at the test site.When the patient is quiet,
gradually increase the force of the pinch until a response is elicited.
b.
Two types of response may be seen:
(1) Reflex fexion of the limb or skin twitch indicating the sensory neurons and spinal segments
are intact.
(2)A behavioral response, such as crying or biting,which indicates the ascending pain pathways
in the spinal cord and brain stem to theforebrain areintact.
2. Deep pain, also called slow pain, is felt as burning, aching, poorly localized pain originating from
the skin or deeper structures.
a.The pathways that carry deep pain sensation are more resistant to damage than other pathways,
including those responsible for proprioception, motor function, and superficial pain.Therefore,
b. When there is no response to pinching with the fingers, use a hemostat to compress the digits or
tail (Fig. 3.22). The degree of compression is gradually increased until a response is elicited.
C.
Withdrawal of the limb indicates only an intact reflex arc (peripheral nerve and spinal segments).
A behavioral response such as turning thehead or vocalization indicates conscious perception.

such as crying or turning the head,indicates perception of deep pain.(Illustration byAnton Hoffman)
d. In patients with severe spinal cord injuries, the presence or absence of deep pain perception is
important in assessing prognosis for recovery. It is critical not to confuse reflex withdrawal with
consciousperception.

Introduction
Once the neurologic examination is cornpleted, a list of differential diagnoses is formed based on the lesion
localization, the signalment, and the history (e.g., onset, progression, painful vs. non-painful). In order to
include a minimum database (e.g, complete blood count, biochemistry panel, urinalysis); radiographs;
cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) analysis; contrast radiographic studies, such as myelography or epidurography;
advanced imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging; or electrodi-
agnostic studies, such as electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies, or brain stem
auditory evoked response (BAER) tests. Occasionally, muscle or nerve biopsy or exploratory surgery is
indicated. Diagnostic tests commonly used to evaluate dogs and cats with suspected neurologic disease are
discussed in this chapter. For purposes of both patient safety and diagnostic accuracy, the procedures
described in this chapter should be performed by appropriately trained individuals or under the direct
guidance of such individuals. Most general small-animal practitioners will not be performing the procedures
described in this chapter. However, maintaining a general knowledge basc in regard to these procedures will
assist the primary clinician in communicating effectively with both clicnts and specialists involved in
managing patients with neurologic disease. This chapter is mcant, therefore, to provide the reader with a
brief overview of neurodiagnostic procedures; more in-depth descriptions of individual tests may be found
by consulting the references at the end of the chapter.

The CSF bathes the brain and spinal cord. It is produced mainly by the choroid plexus of the lateral, third,
and fourth ventricles but also by brain capillaries, parenchymal cells, and ependymal cells. Carbonic anhy-
drase is an enzyme important in the formation of CSF; drugs that inhibit carbonic anhydrasc may decrease
CSF production. The normal rate of CSF production in dogs ranges from 47 to 66 ml/min, and in cats,
20-22 ml/min. The CSF is drained by the arachnoid villi, which are small projections of specialized arach-
noid cells,into thevenous sinuses that surround thebrain.Abnormalities in the color,cellularity,and
protein level of the CSF may contribute to, or, in rare cases, confirm the diagnosis. It is rare for tumor cells
or organisms to be visualized in CSF samples, but when it does occur, a definitive diagnosis can bc made.
The cell count and protein level of the CSF can be thought of as the central nervous system analog of the
complete blood count (CBC) and serum protein level for the systemic circulation, respectively.Abnormal
CBC and serum protein results often assist in the diagnosis of systemic illness when viewed in the context
of other laboratory abnormalities, as well as historical complaints and clinical findings; such abnormalities
are typically not indicative of any spccifc disease when viewed as isolated test results. Similarly, results of
CSF analysis often contribute to a diagnosis, but rarely by themselvcs do they support a specific diagnosis.
CSF analysis is very sensitive,in that it is often abnormal in patients with neurologic disease;it is vey
nonspecific, however, in most cases.
A.Indications for cerebrospinal fuid collection (CSF “tap")
1.Encephalopathies often are an indication for CSF analysis. In particular, infectious and noninfectious
infammatory diseases can be best characterized by evaluating the cellularity and protein levels in the
CSF Different infammatory diseases lead to an accumulation of different types of cells in the CSF
75

APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
and variably affct the amount and type of protein that is present. Degenerative,metabolic, tra
matic, and neoplastic brain lesions may also alter the normal CSF Any disease affecting the brain,
including seizure disorders, should lead the clinician to consider CSF analysis as parr of the diagnos-
tic plan.
2. Any spinal cord lesion, or myelopathy, that is not readily diagnosed on spinal imaging, should be
evaluated by CSF analysis. Focal, multifocal, and diffuse spinal cord lesions wil lead to changes in
the CSF. Cerebrospinal fuid collection should be done prior to myelography, since myelographic
contrast agents will change the character of the CSF and will frequently produce a mild inffamma-
tory response. These changes are believed to influence CSF analysis for at least thrcc to five days
following the myelogram. In one study of normal dogs, the CSF white blood cell (WBC) count
returned to normal within 72 hours of myelography, and CSF protein elevation resolved by 7 days
after myelography.
meninges enclose the nerve roots distally until they become the peripheral nerves. Thus, any disease,
especially those inflammatory in nature, that affects the spinal nerve roots may alter the CSF.
B. Relative contraindications and risks of performing a CSF tap
1. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to mass lesions or inflammatory disease increases the risk of
brain herniation (and subsequent death)when a CSF tap is performed.Typically, this is herniation
of the cerebellar vermis and brain stem caudally through the foramen magnum. Ccrcbral herniation
past the osseous tentorium caudally, or past the falx cerebri laterally, may also occur. The incidence
of brain herniation following a CSF tap has been found to be slightly higher in cats than dogs.
Mannitol, corticosteroids, and hyperventilation may be used to decrease the risk. Because of the
increased risk of herniation, CT or MR imaging should be performed prior to a CSF tap when mass
lesions are suspected. There is probably no advantage of lumbar versus cerebellomedullary cisternal
CSF collection in terms of brain herniation risk.
2. Inadvertent penetration of the parenchyma at the cerebellomedullary angle may lead to temporary
signs of brain stem disease, such as vestibular abnormalities, or cessation of voluntary respiration and
death.
 3. Performing CSF collection in small animals requires general anesthesia, as a rule. If the patient is an
unacceptable anesthetic risk, lumbar puncture may be attermpted with sedation and local (epidural)
ancsthesia.
C. Areas of cerebrospinal fluid procurement and collection technique
1. One milliter per 5 kg body weight of CSF can be safely removed at one time for analysis. Usually,
1-1.5 ml are collected (about 10 drops). The fluid should be collected in a sterile glass tube, prefer-
ably without EDTA (e.g, red-top tube). EDTA may cause falsely elevated protein concentrations, as
well as false low cell concentrations in small samples. Since EDTA is bactericidal, it may interfere
with CSF culture results in cascs of CNS bacterial infections. However, EDTA may help preserve
cellular morphology. The authors routinely collect both a red-top and purple-top (EDTA) sample for
analysis.
Cerebrospinal fuid is most commonly obtained from the cerebellomedullary cistern (cisternal
tap; Fig. 4.1). CSF collected from this site may be more representative of lesions involving the brain
than CSF collected from a lumbar puncture. Anatomic landmarks useful in performing cisternal
CSF taps include the external occipital protuberance, the cranial aspect of the dorsal spine of the axis
(C2 cervical vertebra), and the transverse processes (“wings") of the atlas (C1 cervical vertebra). The
patient is placed in lateral recurmbency, and the neck is fexed by an assistant.The animal's nose must
be kept parallel with the table. A non-collasing endotracheal tube should be used to avoid occlud-
ing airfow during the procedlure. Red rubber endotracheal tubes should be avoided because it has
been. shown that these tubes are much more prone to complete kinking with neck Hexion when

compared with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) endotracheal tubes. The assistant should “tuck in” the
animal's chin and push the external occipital protuberance toward the individual performing the tap.
Placing some form of support under the neck (e.g., rolled-up paper towel) will help keep the spine
of the axis and the external occipital protuberance in line.
The skin in the region of the tap is shaved and aseptically prepared, and a 22-gauge spinal
needle with a stylet (20-gauge is acceptable in larger patients) is inserted on midline, directed toward
the occipitoatlantal space. Sterile gloves are worn for the duration of the procedure. The proper
location for needle insertion can be estimated in several ways. The authors prefer to locate the cranial
aspect of the C2 spine with an index finger, then press firmly with the finger tip as the finger is
simultaneously advanced cranially. In most patients, a ridge or “divet” can be palpated approximately
one-third of the distance between the cranial aspect of the C2 spine and the external occipital
the ridge should allow entry into the occipitoatlantal space. An alternative method is to draw an
imaginary line across the cranial limits of the wings of C1 and a perpendicular line from the external
occipital protuberance caudally. The needle may be inserted at the intersection of these lines. The
skin is punctured first, then the index finger and thumb of one hand (left hand for a right-handed
person) is used to stabilize the needle against the skin surface, as the other hand is used to slowly
advance the spinal needle.After every few millimcters of advancement, the stylet is removed to

observe for CSF Aow.Typically, the clinician will be able to feel the needle pass through fibrous
tissue planes, producing a “popping” sensation. If the needle abuts bone, slight cranial or caudal
redirection of the needle tip may allow entry into the dorsal subarachnoid space.
2. Lumbar puncture for CSF collection (lumbar tap) is usually performed at the L4-L5 space in large
dogs or at the L5-L6 space in smaller dogs and cats (Fig. 4.2). Lumbar CSF may be more represen-
tative of lesions involving the thoracolumbar spinal cord than CSF from a cisternal puncture.The
patient is placed in lateral recumbency, and an area is shaved and aseptically prepared for CSF
collection. The patient's pelvic limbs are advanced cranially to open up the interarcuate space. The
authors prefer to face the ventral aspect of the patient and bend over the patient to insert the spinal
needle.The spinal necdle is inserted just lateral to midline,adjacent to the caudodorsal limit of a
spinous process (L6 for L5-L6 puncture; L5 for L4-L5 puncture). The needle is inserted at a 30°-
60° angle from an imaginary line drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the spine.
After the interarcuate space is entered, the needle will pass through the dorsal dura mater. Often,
at this point, a twitch of the pelvic limbs and/or tail will be noted. The needle is advanced to the
floor of the vertebral canal, and the stylet is withdrawn. CSF is allowed to drip into a collection
tube. Although the spinal needle penetrates the spinal cord during a lumbar CSF tap, this does not
appear to cause any clinical problems.

D. Cerebrospinal fuid evaluation
There arc a variety of tests that may be performed on CSF. Typically, a total cell count, differential cell
count (after cytocentrifugation), and a protein level are ascertained. A glucose level is occasionally obtained,
and it is normally 60%-80% of the blood glucose level. If infectious disease is suspected, appropriate
culturcs or serology can be performed on the fluid. Electrophoresis of CSF may help to characterize the
type(s) of protein present in the CSE For some diseases (e.g., canine distemper virus, feline infectious
peritonitis [FIP; coronavirus] CNS infection in cats), amplification of genetic material via polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) may be indicated. Ideally, cell counts should be performed within 30 minutes ofCSF
collection;however,thereisrecentevidence thatreliablecell countsmay beobtainedupto48hours later
when the CSF is preserved through the addition of autologous serum. Prior treatment may alter the expected
results of CSF analysis, especially in patients with infammatory disease treated with corticosteroids.
1.Color and clarity
Normal CSF is clear and colorless, with the consistency of water. Prior hemorrhage (occurring a
minimum of 10 hours prior to CSF collection) in the CSF may result in a yellow tinge, referred to
as xanthochromia.This discoloration can persist for 2-4 weeks following hemorrhage into the
subarachnoid space, but it is usually resolved in 48 days. Other potential causes for xanthochromia
are severe icterus and markedly elevated CSF protein levels.
Gross blood contamination may be iatrogenic or due to ongoing hemorrhage in the subarach-
noid space. Iatrogenic hemorrhage is more common with lumbar taps compared to cisternal taps.
Although iatrogenic hemorrhage interferes with interpretation of CSF results, the extent to which it
does so is controversial. It has been suggested that each 500-700 red blood cells (RBCs) per millili-
for 1 WBC/ml in cats. However, it has also been demonstrated that RBC counts in CSF as high as
15,000/ml may occur with minimal elevation of the WBC count. The effect of hemorrhage on CSF
protein levels is typically low, with approximately 1200 RBCs/ml needed to increasc the protein
concentrationby1 mg/dl
Increased turbidityof CSFisusually due to an elevatednumber of cells(over200WBCs/ml,
ovcr 400 RBCs/ml) and occasionally due to increased protein levels. Elevated protein levels in CSF
will also cause the fluid to be more viscous. CSF that tends to clot is rare and is caused by markedly
increased amounts of protein.
2. Total and differential WBC count
Though the actual number may vary with the lahoratory used, there are typically fewer than five
nucleated cells per mililiter of CSF In normal dogs and cats,lumbar CSF typically has fewer WBCs
per milliliter than cisternal CSE The distribution should be predominantly mononuclear cells with.
only occasional neutrophils
3.Protein level
Quantitative determinations are the most accurate.Although each laboratory will establish
normal ranges, normal protein concentration for cisternal CSF is less than 27 mg/dl in dogs and
cats. Normal protein levels will be higher when the CSF is collected from a lumbar puncture
(approximately twice that of cisternal CSF, or less than 45 mg/dl).
E. CSF in disease
1. The greater the meningeal or cpendymal involvement, in general, the greater the number of WBCs
expected in the CSF. Deep-scated parenchymal lesions may be associated with mildly increased or
normal cell counts, often with elevated protein levels. Incrcased nucleated cell counts in the CSF are
referred to aspleocytosis.Anormal cell countwith anelevatedproteinlevelis oftenreferredtoas
albuminocytologicdissociation.
2.S
Suppurative means a predominance of neutrophils. A neutrophilic pleocytosis is often associated with
bacterial infections and corticosteroid-responsive (aseptic) meningitis. Other diseases in which
neutrophils may predominate in CSF include some viral encephalitides (e.g., acute canine distemper
4/ NEURODIAGNOSTICS
81
infection, FIP meningocnccphalitis in cats), fungal infections, meningiomas, and fibrocartilaginous
embolic myelopathy (FCE). Neutrophils associated with infectious diseases (e.g., bacterial meningo-
roid-responsive meningiris) disorders.
 3. Mononuclear cell pleocytosis refers to a predominance of either lymphocytes or macrophages in the
CSF This is the most cominon pleocytosis encountered and is usually associated with granulomarous
meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) in dogs. The necrotizing encephalitides (Pug/Maltese encephalitis,
phosarcoma involving the CNS may also be associated with a lymphocytic pleocytosis. A predomi-
nantly mononuclear pleocytosis can be caused by fungal, viral (e.g., canine distemper virus),
protozoal, rickctrsial, and chronic bacterial infections.
4. Fosinophilic pleocytosis is rare. It has been associated with aberrant parasite migration in the CNS,
rabies virus, cryptococcal, protozoal, and protothecal infections.Ihere is also a rare idiopathic
condition called cosinophilic meningoencepbaliis, which is characterized by a substantial proportion of
eosinophils in the CSF.
II1.Neuroimaging
The realm of neuroimaging typically includes survcy ("plain") radiographs (e.g., skull, spine), myelography,
epidurography, diskography, CT, and MR imaging. General anesthesia is often recommended for survey
radiography and is required for contrast radiography (e.g., myelography, epidurography), as well as CT and
MR imaging studies. On some occasions, ultrasonography is also helpful. Ultrasonography may be used in
the diagnosis of hydrocephalus and for intraoperative imaging of brain and spinal tumors. Ultrasonography
perforined for veterinary neurodiagnosis due to the wide availability of CT and MR imaging and the
higher-quality images thesc tools provide. However, rectal scintigraphy is often performed to diagnose
patients with megaesophagus) and parency of surgically placed shunts in hydrocephalic patients.
1, The main use of survey radiography is as a rapid screening tool for obvious bony abnormalities. Soft
tissue structures of the CNS are poorly visualized, if at all, with survey radiographs. A minimum of
two views (e.g., lateral and ventrodorsal) is required.
2.Survey radiographs of the skull may reveal fractures and osseous neoplasia, or may suggest soft tisse
or fuid densities in the nasal passages, sinuses, or middle ear canals. Appropriate positioning for
these purposes.
3. Survey spinal radiographs in the unanesthetized patient are often of questionable diagnostic quality duc
to poor patient positioning and patient moveiment. Ohvious osscous tumors (Fig. 4.3), advanccd
diskospondylitis (Fig. 4.4), displaced fractures orluxations (Fig. 4.5),and congenital verrebral anoma-
lies (c.g, hcmiverrebrae), may be appreciated on survcy spinal fims in the unanesthetized patient. If the
patient is likely to undergo anesthesia for myclography and/or surgery (e.g., acutely paralyzed Dachs-
4. High-quality spinal radiographs under anesthesia may reveal a number of abnormalities. In patients
with intervertebral disk disease, collapsed disk spaces, decreased size of the intervertebral foraminae,
or mineralized disk material within the vertebral canal or intervertebral foraminae may be appreci-
ated (Fig. 4.6). Subtle vertebral fractures or subluxations with minimal displacement may be more
readily apparent on radiographs performed with the patient anesthetized versus radiographs procured
when the patient is awake. Other radiographic abnormalities that may be more evident in the
anesthietized patient include subtle bony lesions associatcd with rneoplasia (e.g., mild bone lysis),

abnormalities associated with articular facets (including small fractures), and subtle bony changes
suggestive of early diskospondylitis (e.g., small regions of vertebral end plate lysis). In general, survey
radiography is less sensitive than CT for identifying subtle bone lysis and small fractures.
B. Myel0graphy12,43,1,62,69,71,8,109,10
1.Myelography is a procedure in which spinal radiographs are obtained follwing the injection of a
radiopaque contrast agent into the subarachnoid space. Nonionic, iodinated, water-soluble contrast
agents are used, iohexol and iopamidol being the most common.

disk space, decreased size of the intervertebral foramen, and calcified material in the vertebral canal are apparent at the L1-
L2 intervertebral disk space.
2.Themyelogram is performedvia a cisternal or lumbar tap.CSF should be collectedprior to contrast
injection, as the contrast will change the composition of the CSF and may prevent accurate analysis
for a minimum of three to five days. The authors prefer lumbar versus cisternal injection of contrast,
regardless of the area of interest. Lumbar myelography often results in better image quality and is
safer than cisternal myelography. The dosage of contrast used for a regional study (e.g., cervical
myelogram with cisternal contrast injection) is 0.3 ml/kg body weight. For fullstudies (e.g., cervical
myelogram with lumbar injection), the dose is 0.45 ml/kg body weight. The contrast is injected
slowly, approximately 2-3 ml per minute. The authors prefer to administer a test injection (e.g.,
0.5-1.0 ml, depending on patient size) to ensure the contrast is in the subarachnoid space before
administering the remainder of the calculated contrast dose.
3.Myelography is used to assist in the diagnosis of myelopathies. It is indicated for cases in which
survey radiographs are either normal or inconclusive, despite neurologic evidence of myelopathy.
Myelography is also often helpful in estimating the location, extent, and severity of spinal leions.
The ability to easily and rapidly visualize the entire spinal cord is an advantage of myelography over
other imaging procedures (e.g., CT, MR). Myelography is also generally less costly and may be more
readily available than CT or MR imaging in certain situations (e.g., emergencies). As more veteri-
nary referral centers acquirehigh-fieldMR imaging systems,myelography and other contrast radio-
 graphic procedures (e.g., epidurography, diskography) are assuming a less important role in
neuroimaging of dogs and cats.
4. Despite the advantages of myelography, it is a somewhat invasive procedure and is associated with a
low level of inherent risks. Overall, postmyelographic seizures occur in approximately 10%-20% of
dogs undergoing the procedure; this adverse event is more likely to occur in larger dogs (more than
20 kg) and is also more likely to occur with cisternal versus lumbar contrast injections. In addition,
the likelihood of postmyelographic seizure activity increases with increasing total volume (not dose
on a milliliter per kilogram basis) of contrast injected. In one large study, 21.4% of myelogram
patients experienced seizure activity after the procedure overall.Dogs over 20kg had a seizure
prevalence of 34.17%, whereas dogs less than 20 kg had a prevalence of 11.65%. Also in this study
it was found that 35% of dogs with cisternal injections had seizures following the procedure, com-
paredto5%ofdogswithlumbarinjections.Finally,this studydemonstratedthat each5-mlincrease
in injected iohexol volume equated toa30% increase in seizure likelihood.Dogswith andwithout
scizure activity after themyelogramhadmean total contrastinjectedvolumesof16.8ml and9.1ml,
respectively. In another report, male Doberman pinschers with caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy
(CCSM; “wobblers” syndrome), were found to be particularly predisposed to postmyelographic
seizure activity. Most patients that seizure will do so only once or twice in the 24 hours following
the procedure, and the seizures usually cease with an intravenous diazepam injection (0.2-0.4 mg/kg).
84
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEAND FELINENEUROLOGY
Maintaining slight elevation of the patient's head during and after the procedure (until the patient is
awake) and assuring hydration with intravenous fuids during and 24 hours after myelography are
recommendations that limit the occurrence and severity of postmyelographic seizure activity.
All dogs rcciving a myelogram should be under close hospital observation (e.g., in an ICU) for
the first 24 hours following the procedure. Parenchymal damage from insertion of the needle is rare
in myelography, but may occur, especially in the cervical region. Worsened neurologic status follow
ing the myelogram is usually caused by transient chemical myelitis secondary to contrast injection.
The risk for this may be higher in patients with preexisting infammatory disease, or chronic spinal
cord compression (e.g., chronic type II disk disease). In the authors expcrience, the risk of transient
logic status within 72 hours. Inadvertent contrast injection into the parenchyma or the central canal
of the spinal cord may cause worsened neurologic status. In most cases, patients recover from this
iatrogenic trauma, but permanent deficits may occur in a small proportion of animals, Myelography
is contraindicated for patients with known or highly suspected infammatory disease of the CNS, as
it may cause worsened neurologic status.
Myelography is also contraindicated in patients that may have elevated ICP Since cervical
hyperesthesia occasionally is associated with forebrain lesions, any historical or clinical indication of
an underlying encephalopathy should prompt consideration of an alternative imaging modality (e.g,
CTorMR)
5. There are four basic myelographic patterns: normal, extradural, intradural/extramedullary, and
intramedullary (Fig. 4.7). Normally, the contrast columns parallel each other and conform to the
vertebral canal, except at the cauda equina region, where the subarachnoid space tapers. The spinal
cord ends at about the L6 verrebral region in most dogs and at the first sacral vertebral region in
most cats, although there maybe quite a bit ofvariation between brecds.
The spinal cord is normally wider at the cervical and lumbosacral intumescences. The ventral
subarachnoid space is often less prominent than the dorsal subarachnoid space in the thoracolumbar
rcgion in dogs. The dorsal subarachnoid space in the atlantoaxial region is often wider than the
remainder of the spinal cord. The cervical spinal cord region in cats often appears wider on myelog-
Intervertebral disk extrusion/protrusion is the most common cause of an extraduralmyelo
graphic pattern. Other causes of extradural patterns include vertebral fracture/luxation, congenital
vertebral anomalies,hypertrophied soft tissue structures(e.g.,interarcuate ligament, synovialmem
branes),extradural hemorrhage,vertebral neoplasia,and soft tissue neoplasia (e.g,feline lymphosar-
coma). It is important to realize that the nature of an extradural compression is best appreciated
when viewed tangential to the direction of the cord deviation. For example, if a disk extrusion is
compressing the cord from ventral to dorsal, with no lateralizing component, the myelographic
partern as viewed from a ventrodorsal view (parall with direction of compression) could be misin-
terpreted as intramedullary. With interverebral disk extrusions, which are often ventrolateral (i.e.,
ventral but somewhat lateralized), it is usually helpful to obtain oblique views in addition to stan-
dard dorsal and ventral views, in order to ascertain the correct side of disk extrusion for purposes of
surgical planning. In one study, the accuracy of correctly identifying the side of disk extrusion was
significantly higher for obliquc versus ventral views, but the accuracy was higher still when informa-
tion from these views was combined.
An intradural/extramedullary pattern is produced when there is a lesion within the subarachnoid
space (intradural),but not invading the parenchyma of thc cord (extramedullary). As the contrast
fows around the obstructive lesion, it may be outlined, appcaring as a “flling defect." Sometimes,
the filling defect is incompletely outlined and resembles a golf tee, hence the term golf tee sign (Fig.
4.8). Intradural/extramedullary patterns are most often associated with neoplasia, primarily menin-
giomas and nerve sheath tumors. Much less commonly, intradural hemorrhage may lead to this

that contrast is excluded from the region of the mass. In such cases, the myelographic pattern may
appear to be intramedullary. In such cases, a CT is often performed through the abnormal region, as
contrast is better visualized on CT images.
An intramedullary pattern is typically associated with spinal cord edema, expansile parenchymal

C. Epidurography1,2,47,73,78,82,8.91,95
Myelography is often inadequate for the cvaluation of cauda equina lesions in dogs because the subarach-
noid space ends at the conus medullaris, which is in the L6 region in most canine patients. Epidural
contrast injection may help delineate compressive cauda equina lesions, particularly those at the L7-S1
intervertcbral disk space (e.g., degenerative lumbosacral stenosis). Epidurography is associated with a lw
level of morbidity.Due to the irregular contour of the epidural versus subarachnoid space,the contrast
columns of an epidurogram appear comparatively rough and uneven in comparison with the contrast
columns of a myelogram.
Iohexol or iopamidol is used. The volume of injected contrast is 0.1-0.2 ml/kg body weight. After
aseptic preparation of the chosen site, injection of contrast material may be performed at L7-S1, at the
sacrocaudaljunction,orbetween one ofthe caudalintervertebralspaces.Thedisadvantage toL7-S1 con-
trast injection is that injection artifact may produce an unsatisfactory epidurogram in some cases.
Multiple radiographic views are helpful.These include lateral films taken with the coxofemoral joints in
neutral, fexed, and hyperextended positions. In a normal epidurogram, contrast fills the epidural space
evenly with the pelvis in any position.
Potential abnormalities that may be appreciated on an epidurogram include complete obstruction of
cranial fow of contrast media past the L7-S1 space or dorsal deviation of the ventral contrast column over
this space (Fig.4.10). This deviation may be exacerbated on extended views and alleviated on flexed views.

D. Diskography13,73.78,82,95
1.Diskography is used less often than epidurography for evaluation of L7-S1 disk lesions. Similar to
epidurography, this procedure is associated with a low level of morbidity. Diskography involves
injecting iohexol or iopamidol (0.1-0.3 ml/kg body weight) directly into the nucleus pulposus of the
disk, after which radiographs are procured.
2. After aseptic site preparation, the spinal needle is placed directly into the L7-S1 disk, prcferably
under fuoroscopic guidance. In a normal disk, it is very diffcult to inject contrast. In a degenerative
disk, 2-3 mls of contrast is often readily injected into a large-breed dog. Compression of the cauda
equina region by the contrast-delineated L7-S1 disk is often readily evident (Fig. 4.11).
3. The authors prefer to perform a combination diskography/epidurography procedure using a single
needle puncture. After the diskogram is performed, the needle is withdrawn from the disk into the
epiduralspace andadditional contrastisinjected.Additionalradiographs arethen obtaincd afterthe
epidural contrast is administered (Fig. 4.12).
1. In CT, X-rays and computers are used to provide cross-sectional images of the patient. The final
images are composed of many small image squares called pixels.The thickness of these image squares
(voxels) is determined by the chosen image thickness. The patient is placed in the opening of the CT
gantry (Fig. 4.13). The gantry contains the X-ray tube, X-ray collimators, and X-ray detectors. The
X-ray tube and detectors are on opposite sides, and the patient is between them. Slice thickness is
controlled by the collimators.TheX-ray tuberotates around anobject ofinterest asX-rays are

tissue attenuates the beam to a different degree. The different attenuating abilities of different tissues,
or linear attenuation coeffcients, provide thebasis of tissue contrast.The attenuated beam of X-ray
photons is received by the detector, and the information is fed into the computer.The computer
assigns grayscale numbers (Hounsfield units) to the tissues that the X-ray beam passed through,
based upon theirlinear attenuation coefficients.
2. The resultant image reflects the different grayscale numbers of different tisue types, and therefore
their respective abilities to attenuate X-rays. As one would expect from conventional X-ray proce-
dures, bone appears white, air appears black, and fuid is somewhere in between (gray). The corre-
sponding Hounsfield unit numbers for these tissues are +1000, -1000, and 0, respectively.
3.The human eye can discern approximately 20 shades of gray. The number of shades of gray in the
image, as well as the central gray color (above which tissues are brighter, below which they are
darker) can be manipulated once the image information is received by the computer. Choosing the
central gray color, above which tissues appear brighter, and below which darker, is referred to as
setting the window level (WL). The Hounsfield unit of the tissue of interest is typically chosen as
the center of the window level. The number of shades of gray assigned to a particular image repre-
sents the window width (WW). A narrow WW is chosen for soft tissue (e.g., brain parenchyma) in
order to improve contrast resolution (the ability to discern differences in composition of tissues in
close proximity).AwideWWis chosen for tissues inwhich goodinherent contrast already exists

(e.g, air in the frontal sinus region) or when imaging a region where a wide range of tissue densities
is displayed (e.g., bone/brain parenchyma interface). When imaging brain parenchyma, a WL of
approximately 35 and a WW of 150 may be assigned (Fig. 4.14). In contrat, when imaging bony
tissue, a WL of 420 and WW of 1500 may be used (e.g., a bone window; Fig. 4.15).
4. After obtaining CT scans of the brain, non-ionic iodinated contrast is often given intravenously and
the patient is rescanned. The contrast agent will often demonstrate areas of blood-brain barrier
disruption (Fig. 4.16).
5. With appropriate computer software, tissue voxels may be combined to produce a three-dimensional
image (3-D reconstruction; Fig. 4.17) or to produce images in other planes.
6. Computed tomography is most often used to help diagnose brain disorders. Computed tomography
is also occasionally used in cases of spinal disorders, often in conjunction with myelography

(Fig. 4.18). Disorders of the cauda equina (e.g., degenerative lumbosacral stenosis) are also effectively
imaged by CT.
7. Advantages of CT over other imaging modalities are numerous. Computed tomography provides
superior soft tissue contrast in comparison with conventional radiography. The cost of CT is typi-
cally less than MR imaging. Computed tomography is a more rapid imaging modality than MR
imaging, and bone and acute hemorrhage are better visualized with CT versus MR imaging; these
attributes make CT preferable to MR imaging in acute head trauma patients. Other advantages of
CT imaging are the ability to alter window settings after data acquisition and the ability to form 3-
Dreconstructed images.

exposure to ionizing radiation (X-rays) whereas MR imaging does not. Magnetic resonance imaging
provides superior soft tissue detail in comparison with CT. Computed tomography is usually adequate
for visualizing mass lesions in thebrain and spinal cord. However, subtle parenchymal lsions (e.g
inflammatory foci in GME), as well as brain (especially brain stem) and spinal cord lesions in very small
dogs and cats, may be more appreciable with MR imaging than CT. Image artifacts are typically more
of a problem with CT imaging versus MR imaging. In particular, beam hardening, which appears as
black streaks, is a common CT artifact produced when imaging the caudal fossa (Fig. 4.19). This

artifact is due to the dense bone in the petrous temporal region. The average energy of the X-ray beam
that traverses this thickbone and reaches the detectors is very highbecause photons of lower energy are
absorbed by the bone.The computer interprets the high average energybeam asX-rays that have passed
through alow-density structure, ncorrectly assigning the tissue a low Hounsfield unitnumber (black
streaks). Beam hardening does not occur in MR imaging.
1. Magnetic resonance imaging is based upon the magnetic properties of living tissue, primarily protons
of hydrogen atoms. The proton has a spin and a charge and therefore produces a tiny magnetic field.
in a magnetic field will rotate much like the wobbling of a spinning top as it begins to experience
the effects of gravity (Fig. 4.20). This wobbling or rotating motion is called precession; the frequency
of this precession depends on the strength of the static magnetic field (Bo) and inherent characteris-
tics of hydrogen protons. Normaily, the individual magnetic fields of the body's protons are ran-
body's protons will align themselves longitudinally with that feld, precessing along the field's axis;
this produces a net magnetic vector in the direction (the +z direction) of this static magnetic field
(Fig. 4.21). Although this magnetic field is technically uniform, there are intrinsic and extrinsic
inhomogeneitics within the field that will lead to individual protons precessing at slightly different
of clocks on a wall in a hotel lobby; typically, cach clock has a different time, corresponding to the
local time in a different major city (e.g., New York, Paris, London). All clocks have the same fre-
quency, but they are out of phase. If all the clocks were set to the local time in the city in which the
hotel was located, they would be in phase. This concept of phase coherence is important to the
understanding of signal gencration, especially when considcring T2 relaxation.
Radiofrequency (RF) pulses are administered to the paticnt while in the magnetic field.This will
increase the energy state of some of the protons, causing them to displace away from the main

direction of the magnetic field and precess at an angle to this field. These displaced protons produce
a net magnetic vector in the direction of the displacement. Radiofrequency pulses that result in a 90°
to 180° displacement of protons are typically applied. The precise pattern of these pulses depends on
the specific MR imaging sequence of interest (i.e., T1-weighted, T2-weighted, etc.). These displaced
protons will, as a group, produce a net magnetic vector at an angle (the vector is in the zy plane-
longitudinally displaced from the original magnetic field or Bo) to the static magnetic field with
RF pulse applied to the patient. It is important to realize that displacement of the net magnetic
vector away from the z axis is necessary for a detectable RF signal to be produced. Vectors aligned
with Bo will not produce a detectable signal (whether in the +z or -z direction). As before, following
displacement by an RF pulse, the protons will again precess around the new magnetic vector.
However, in addition to displacing the net magnetic vector of the precessing protons to a higher
energy level, the application of an RF pulse also tends to rephase the individual protons, bringing
them back into phase coherence (Fig. 4.23). After a 90° RF pulse, however, protons tend to quickly
lose phase coherence again or dephase, a process referred to as free induction decay.

magnetic field. In addition, the protons will lose phase coherence. As they relax, they release the
previously applied energy as radio waves. These radio waves are picked up at different rates and
receiver coils in the MR imaging machine,which convert the energy to electrical signals.The
T1and T2relaxation—that occur concurrently after
xation are related to the return of the displaced net
and theloss ofphase coherence
ce among individual protons (T2 relaxation).Different tissues have
different T1 and T2 relaxation times.
.Differcnt tissues in the body have varying proton densities
(i.e., number of hydrogen protons in a given volume of tissue), and the hydrogen protons in differ-
ent tissues have varying levcis of mobility. These tissue differennces account for the variation in signal
intensities generated by different tissue types in MR imaging (e.g., fat vs. CSF). The variation in
relaxation timesbetween different tissues in thebody is far greater than the variation in tissue
density, so soft tissue contrast resolutionis superior in MR images compared with CT images.
T1 relaxation refers to the return of excited protons to the original energy state of the static
magnetic field. Since this represents energy exchange between spinning high-energy protons and the
molecular lattice from which they were excited, it is also called spin-lattice relaxation. Because this
energy transfer occurs as the displaced net magnetic vcctor relaxes back to the z or longitudinal
direction, it is also referred to as longitudinal relaxation.
T2 relaxation describes cnergy exchange between the magnetic fields of individual protons before
and after the application of a RF pulse. It also includes cnergy exchanges between protons and local
fuctuations in the static magnetic feld. These magnetic field inhomogeneities tend to dephase
proton spins, decreasing the potential signal that can be generated after an excitatory RF pulse. T2
relaxation is also called spin-spin relaxation. Because this type of relaxation occurs in a transverse
direction (the xy plane), it is also referred to as transverse relaxation. The phenomenon of T2 relax-
ation is primarily related to the loss of phase coherence among excited protons as they relax back to
the equilibrium or ground state.
The time it takes for 64% of the protons in a particular tissue to regain the original energy state
following the application of a 90° displacing RF pulse is that tissue's relaxation time (T1 or T2).

3. The time interval between successive applications of RF pulses during a scan (repetition time or TR)
and the time interval between RF pulse administration and collection of the resultant radio wave
signal by the receiver coils (echo time or TE) are manipulated in MR imaging. These manipulations
are based on known T1 and T2 relaxation properties of tissues.The basic MRimaging sequences are
referred to as T1-weighted and T2-weighted studies.Bothof these sequences beginwith an initial
90° RF pulse. Because of the problem of dephasing or free induction decay, the second pulse in T2-
weighting is 180°, which serves to rephase the protons, minimizing much of the magnetic field
inhomogeneity influence that tends to decrease the T2 signal.
Imaging a patient using a short (e.g., less than 800 msec) TR and short (e.g., less than 30 msec)
TE will lead to hyperintense signals (i.e., white) from tissues with short T1 relaxation times.This
type of imaging is called T1-weighting. Tissues with long T1 relaxation times will not have enough
time to release much radiofrequency energy between successive excitation pulses (tissue saturation)
due to the short TR, and much of what is releasedwill not be received by the coils because of the
short TE. This occurs because the tissues with long T1 relaxation times are repeatedly displaced
away from the main magnetic field and therefore are prevented from releasing as much RF energy
for signal generation as tissues with short T1 relaxation times. Selecting a TR close to the T1 of a
tissue ofinterestwill maximize the signalfrom that tissue.Water has averylongT1 and T2relax-
ation time,whereas fats have short T1 and T2 relaxation times. On aT1-weighted image,water
(e.g., CSF, edema) will appear dark, and fat will appear bright. Since white matter has more myelin
than gray matter (i.e.,fatty tissue tends to have short T1 relaxation times),white matter will be
brighter than gray matter in a T1-weighted image (Fig. 4.24). With T2-weighted images, a long
(e.g., more than 2000 msec) TR and a long (e.g., more than 60 msec) TE are used to emphasize
tissueswithlongT2relaxation times.Althoughitmay seem counterintuitive,tissueswith short
T2 relaxation times give the least amount of signal.Such tissues rapidly lose phase coherence,
resulting in small signal production. Free water protons (i.e., CSF protons) maintain phase
coherence for long time periods and therefore will give the greatest signal on T2-weighted images.
For T2-weighted images, a TE closest to the tissue of interest (i.e., free water or CSF) is chosen.
On a T2-weighted image, water will appear bright (white), and fat willappear intermediate in
matter (Fig.4.25).

Depending on the specific disorder suspected, additional imaging scquences such as FLAIR
STIR, or FATSAT (fat saturation) studies may also be performed. The term FLAIR stands for fuid
attenuation inversion recovery. The term STIR is an acronym for short time inversion recovery.
Inversion recovery sequences utilize an initial 180° RF pulse to displace (invert) the net magnetic
vector to the negative z axis (parall with Bo). Since the MR imaging computer registers magnitude
that remain along or near the z axis. As the tissues begin to relax from the initial 180° RF pulse, the
time until application of a subsequent 90° RF pulse is manipulated according to which tissue type is
to be suppressed. In FLAIR imaging, a long inversion time (a specific variant of'TE, the time
between the 180° and 90° RF pulse) is chosen. This will allow tissues with relatively short T1 values
to relax enough to generate a strong signal to the receiver coils. However, free water, with a long T1,
will have only partially relaxed before the 90° pulse pushes it back to the -z axis, effectively nullify-
ing its signal. FLAIR studies are typically used to suppress the signal from free water (e.g., CSF) in
order to discern this from tissue-bound water (e.g., edema), which has a considerably shorter T1
value (Fig. 4.26). FLAIR images are particularly helpful in distinguishing infarcts from cystic struc-
tures and delineating periventricular lesions as distinct from the neighboring ventricular CSF. Both
be suppressed (e.g, discerning optic nerve edema from neighboring periocular fat in optic neuritis).
In STIR imaging, the inversion time between 180° and 90° RF pulses is short. This causes tissues
with short T1 values (i.e., fat) to be inverted to the -Z axis, nullifying its signal, while the magnetic
vectors of other tissues (with longer T1 values) will be displaced from the z or Bo axis, resulting in
signal generation. In STIR imaging, the TE (that is, the time between successive 180° RF pulses, not
the inversion time) is kept relatively long, soCSF stillappears bright (T2 effect), though fat tissu s
other tissues with very short T1 relaxation times, such as gadolinium-enhanced tissucs. FATSAT
imaging is a method of applying a tissue-specifc pulse frequency to selectively saturate fatty tissuc.
This general method of using narrow-band frequency pulses aimed at suppressing specifc tissuc
types is also referred to as chemical selective saturation. This sequence may be applied to T1-
wcighted contrast (see below) images in order to discern contrast enhancement from neighboring
fatty tissue (c.g., peripheral nerve sheath tumor).

administered contrast agent used in MR studies. Similar to iodinated intravenous contrast adminis-
tration in CT imaging, Gd-DTPA is used to demonstrate abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier
(e.g., tumors, infammatory lesions). Gd-DTPA shortens both T1 and T2 relaxation times of tissues
in which it localizes, leading to greatest signal intensity on T1-weighted images (Fig. 4.27).

spinal cord disorders. It is also a very sensitive imaging modality for cauda equina disorders (e.g.
degenerative lumbosacral stenosis). For most brain- and spine-imaging studies, T1-weighted images,
T2-weighted images, and T1-weighted images with Gd-DTPA contrast enhancement are obtained.
IV.Electrodiagnostics
Electrodiagnostic examinations take advantage of the body's electrical properties to help characterize neuro-
logic disorders. These tests require both specialized instrumentation and individuals trained in performing
the tests. There are numerous electrodiagnostic machines available, the majority of which are capable of
performing most or all of the procedures discussed below (Fig. 4.28). There are two main categories of
electrical signals that are produced by the body in the absence of an externally applied stimulus. Evoked

testing is performed with the patient under general anesthesia.The authors prefer the use of a
concentric needle electrode for EMG studies. The needle clectrode is inserted into muscle tissue,

andmuscle activity is recorded.The needle is repositioned several times to sample different areas
of the muscle, and multiple muscles are evaluated. Both the sound and appearance of spontane-
ous muscle activity are evaluated during EMG studies.Abnormal muscle activity from EMG
evaluation is sensitive,but not very specific.Muscle fbers often become hyperexcitable with both
denervation (due to neuropathies) and more direct damage (myopathies). Therefore, abnormal
EMG activity confirms the presence of either a neuropathic or myopathic process, but not
specifically one or the other. Electomyographic abnormalities may not be detectable for five to
seven days following denervation. It should also be kept in mind that not all myopathies or
neuropathies are characterized by abnormal EMG activity.
b. In general, muscle tissue is silent on EMG evaluation (Fig. 4.29) of the anesthetized patient.
Small deviations from baseline (monophasic potentials) are occasionally recorded from muscles,
especially near motor points (sites where major nerve trunks connect with muscle bellies). This
normal activityis called end plate noise or end plate potentials andreflects small depolarizations
(miniature end plate potentials) at neuromuscular junctions (Fig. 4.30). End plate noise sounds
similar to small waves breaking at the seashore or the sound heard when one listens to a seashell.
Immediately after insertion of the needle electrode into a muscle belly, there is typically a short
burst of electrical activity, called insertional activity.This is due to mechanical irritation and
damage to muscle fibers by the needle and is normal unless it lasts more than one to two seconds
after the needle stops moving. Replacement of muscle tissue by fat or connective tissue in
chronic denervation or myopathies may lead to the absence of insertional activity.
In addition to prolonged insertional activity, abnormal EMG activity includes fibrillation poten-
tials, positive sharp waves, and complex repetitive discharges. In general, all of these abnormal
potentials indicate either neuropathy or myopathy, but are not specific for either.
Fibrillation potentials are biphasic or triphasic spikes of short duration that are thought to
arise from individual muscle fbers (Fig. 4.31). They sound like popping noises. When occurring
as a train or continuous run, the sound is like eggs or bacon frying or a heavy rain falling on a

Electroencephalography (EEG) refers to the recording of spontaneous electrical activity of the
cerebral cortex and the interpretation of these recordings. Hlistorically, EEG had many practical
applications, including its use in localizing seizure foci. In modern veterinary neurology, the
clinicalutility of EEG examination is limited.The likelihood of an EEG examination contribut-
ing substantially to the management of a patient with an established generalized seizure disorder
is low. As a localizer of focal brain abnormalities, EEG is fairly inaccurate and provides no
structural information. The increased availability and use of CT and MR technology has been
102
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
Fig. 4.33. Typical scalp clectrode arrangement for EEG recording
associated with a decrease in the use of EEG examinations. However, EEG remains an important
diagnostic tool.
Electroencephalography is often helpful in cases of focal seizure disorders, in which the
diagnosis of thecondition is sometimes equivocal.The authorshave also found EEG examina-
tion useful as a determinant of brain death in comatosepatientswhohavebeen resuscitated
following cardiac arrest. When EEG examination is performed in this latter context, it is usually
done so in conjunction with a BAER examination.
b. Electroencephalography is performed using small recording scalp electrodes. These electrodes are
placed in specific areas so that electrical activity in multiple regions of the cerebral cortex can be
simultaneously recorded (Fig.4.33). Each channel (derivation) represented on the EEG recording
represents electrical potentials occurring between two scalp electrodes, the frst of the named pair
being the exploring electrode and the second being the reference clectrode. The arrangement of
multiple derivations of electrode pairs is referred to as a montage.
There are multiple ways to perform an EEG examination. Since abnormal EEG activity is
likely to occur during physiologic sleep, and since general anesthesia may induce spike activity
(associated with seizure disorders) in normal patients, it is not recommended to perform EEGs in
anesthetized patients. The authors prefer to perform EEGs in a quiet, darkened room with the
patient lightly sedated (e.g., meperidine, 5 mg/kg intramuscularly). The patient typically will
become drowsy and fll asleep, alowing the measurement of both awake and sleeping EEG
activity. A full EEG recording takes approximately 20-40 minutes to perform.
C.
 Normal background electrical activity recorded on EEG examination primarily reflects the
algebraic summation of oscillating resting membrane potentials and subthreshold postsynaptic
potentials (PSPs) of cerebral cortical neurons (Fig. 4.34). Electrical activity of cerebral cortical
neurons is influenced by the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) of the brain stem,
primarily the diencephalon. Fluctuations in membrane potentials of glial cells in the cerebrum
high-frequency, low-voltage activity. The frequency slows and the amplitude of measured poten-
tials increases with drowsiness and non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. The EEG pattern of
REM sleep is similar to the awake EEG pattern.
There is often a high degree of subjectivity in the interpretation of abnormal EEG record-
ings. In general, frequencies and amplitudes that appear either inadequate or excessive for the
in an awake patient) are indicative of brain dysfunction. Spike and spike-wave activity (Fig. 4.35)
are indications of a seizure disorder.

in the medulla. Wave IV likely represents action potentials from the larcral lemniscus and
lemniscal nuclei of the pons. The caudal colliculi of the midbrain and medial geniculate nuclei of
the diencephalon contribute to the generarion of wave V.
To perform the BAER, place the patient in ventral recumbency, attach the scalp electrodes, and
C.
inscrt the ear plugs. Each ear is stimulated separately, typically at 80 and 100 decibels (dB). The
nonstimulated car receives a masking or “white” noise 30--40 dB below that of the stimulated
side. Similar o an clectrocardiogram or an EEG, the BAER can bc recorded with different
arrangements of recording electrodes. The authors prefer a vertex to mastoid recording (VM)
and occasionally record additionally with a vertex to first thoracic vertebra (VT1) lead arrange-
ment. These two types of recording can be accomplished concurrently. Wave IV is oftcn
indistinguishable as a separate wave on the VM recording and may be complexcd with cither
wave III or V.

Fig. 4.37. Flat line BAER recording from a puppy with congenital sensorineural deafness.
d.The appearance of four or five recognizable waves on a BAER recording confirms hearing ability
on that side. A fat line is evidence of deafness (Fig. 4.37). Dogs with congenital sensorineural
deafness (see Chapter 7) typically have fat BAER recordings at both 80 and 100 dB, either
unilaterally or bilaterally. A.fat line, or relatively decreascd amplitude of waves at 80 dB, and a
detectable response at 100 dB sugest a conduction disturbance of hearing (e.g., fuid in the
middle ear cavity due to otitis media). Similarly, a prolonged latency from sound stimulus to the
appearance of wave I at 80 dB that improves at 100 dB suggests a conduction disturbance of
hearing. For evaluation of brain stem integrity, interwave intervals are calculated by the computer
for peak-to-peak latencies between waves I and II, waves III and V, and waves I and V. These
intervals should be within reference ranges and typically do not differ from right to left by more
than about 0.1 ms. More spccifically, the mean difference in interwave intervals between left and
right sides in normal dogs stimulated between 70 and 100 dB have been reported to range from
0.07 ms to 0.13 ms. Because of this range and the standard deviation on either side of the mean
values, the authors feel that a left-to-right difference of 0.2 ms or greater should be regarded as
abnormal, with values between 0.1 ms and 0.2 ms being thought of as suspicious of a brain stem
abnormality. Brain stem lesions (e.g., tumors) will cause a conduction delay, which will be
measured as a prolonged latency that corresponds to the anatomic location of the lesion (Fig.
tude of less than O.5 is indicative of a brain stem lesion. A patient that has experienced brain
death will typically exhibit a fat BAER or have only wave I present on the rccording.
2. Motor nerve conduction velocity25,27.30.34.75.79
Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) studies are performed primarily in animals suspected
of having neuropathies. For MNCV measurement, an electrical stimulus is applied to a nerve with
subcutaneous electrodes, and the resultant depolarization of a muscle supplied by that nerve is
recorded with a recording electrode. The depolarizing cvcnt is a large biphasic or triphasic muscle
potential formed by action potentials of many muscle fbers from many motor units. It is usually
referred to as a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) or an M wave. The latency, or time,
from the stimulus to the onset of the M wave is measured by the computer. A minimum of two sites
of a ncrve must be stimulated in order to calculate a MNCV. The distance between the two stimula-
tion sites (in meters) is divided by the difference in latency from stimulus artifact to M wave appear-
ance for the two sites (in seconds) to arrive at MNCV in minutes per second. The M wave is the
result of (proximal to distal) propagation of nerve depolarization.
When a nerve is artifcialy stimulated, as in MNCV testing, it also depolarizes antidromically
(distal to proximal). Recording conditions may be set to measure one of two smaller waves—F waves
or H waves. F waves result from antidromic motor nerve depolarization causing depolarization of
lower motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.This depolarization leads to a secondary
orthodromic nerve depolarization back down the axon. The subsequent muscle responsc (F wave) is
of much smaller amplitude and longer latency than the M wave. Similarly, the H wave is due to
initial antidromic, then orthodromic, propagation of depolarizing events. However, the H wave
represents an electrically elicited stretch reflex. Rather than clirectly causing motor neuron

depolarization from an antidromic volley up the motor axons, the H refex involves antidromic
depolarization that follows the sensory axons (e.g-,
, Ia axons) into the spinal cord gray matter, leading
to motor neuron depolarization. This motor neuron dep
polarization leads to a secondary muiscle
depolarization (H wave) of smaller amplitude and greater latency than the M wavc. A smaller
stinulus intensity than that used for F wave recording is necessary for H wave mcasuremcnt. F and
H waves are used primarily to evaluare diseases with nerve root pathology (e.g..
polyradiculoneuritis).

imulated at two or three sites, and
the MNCV is calculated after manually measurir
electrodes (Fig. 4.39). This measurement is
source of error in this test. Norrmal MNCV is at least 50 m/sec in older patients, and is typically
greater than 60 m/sec in young to middle-agcd animals. Decreased body remperature may affect
MNCV. The MNCV decreases by 1.8 m/sec for each drop in degrees Celsius from normal. Proximal
 nerve segments have faster MNCVs than distal netve segments. In general, dernyelination is more
likely to cause slowed MNCV than is axonal loss. Small amplirudc M waves or polyphasic M waves
are often indicative of neuropathy, but they may result from myopathies also.
Sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) is typically measured in dogs and cats by stimulating
a distal cutaneous nerve branch and measuring compound action potentials (CAPs) over proximal
sites on the parent nerve. The technique is siimilar to that used for MNCV, but the depolarization

events of interest are antidromic, and CAPs from axonal depolarization are of much smaller magni-
tude than the CMAPs or M waves recorded in MNCV studies. Sensory nerve conduction velocity
recording is primarily used to evaluate patients with suspected neuropathies, especially if MNCV
evaluation is normal or equivocal. It is generally thought that SNCV is more sensitive an indicator
of early neuropathic processes, compared to MNCV.
By placing needle recording electrodes near the interarcuate space over selected regions of the
spinal cord and/or over the scalp region, evoked activity of the CNS can be recorded follwing
stimulation of a peripheral sensory nerve. This latter type of electrodiagnostic testing is referred to as
somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). Depolarizing events recorded on an SSEP recording are
duc to axonal CAPs in the cauda equina region or spinal cord white matter (similar to the CAPs of
peripheral nerves) as well as from gray matter field potentials. Field potentials refer to depolarization/
repolarization events occurring in a group of neurons (e.g., interneuron pool) following excitation

from an incoming volley of action potentials (i.e., from peripheral stimulation). Recording over the
cervical and lumbosacral intumescence areas often results in a high-ainplitude, long-duration poten-
tial, primarily due to these depolarization/repolarization events, These potentials are referred to as
cord dorsum potentials. SSEP studies are used primarily to evaluate the fiunctional integrity of the
spinal cord ascending pathways.
The setup for SNCV and SSEP is similar. Thesc studies are also performed under general
anesthesia. The authors prefer to stirmulatc thc distal branches of the peroneal nerve and record over
proximal scgments of the peroneal and sciatic nerves. Recording is usually accomplished by leaving
the stimulating clcctrodes from the MNCV in place and converting these to recording electrodes.
Additional recording clectrodes may be placed along the spine or scalp, and SSEP recordings may be
made simultaneously with SNCV recordings (Fig. 4.40).
4. Repetitive nerve stimulation33474.75.89
T'he repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test measures successive CMAPs (M waves) induced by
repetitively stimulating the nerve that supplies the muscle from which the potentials are rccorded.
With stimulation rates of five per second or less, thc scquential M waves should be of equal ampli
tude and area as the first. A decremental responsc of 10% or greater indicates a problem with.
neuromuscular transmission. Though not spccific for the discase, a decrementing RNS is usually
indicativc of myasthenia gravis (Fig. 4.41).

myasthenic dog. (Reprinted with permission from Compend Contin Edu Pract Vet3).
General anesthesia is required for RNS in dogs and cats. The authors prefer stimulating the
peroneal nerve at the kncc or hock level and recording from a digital muscle. The serup is the same
as for MNCV, but only one stimulation site is necessary for RNS. In cases of focal myasthenia gravis
(MG), the limb RNS is sometimes normal. In suspect cases of focal MG with normal limb RNS,
the authors have often dermonstrated a decremental responsc in facial musculature (e.g., orbicularis
oculi muscle) following facial nerve stimulation.
The use of magnetic motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to evaluate descending motor pathways
cerebral motor cortex, and recordings of CMAPs (M waves) are made from limb muscles. Record-
ings of depolarizing events can also be obtained from the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Mag-
netic MEPs can be recorded under sedation.
Single-fiber electromyography (SF-EMG) has also been described in dogs. This procedure makes
usc of a specialized needle electrode that records evoked action potentials from individual muscle
fibers. The variability of neuromuscular transmission time for individual muscle fibers, referred to as
"jitter,”" is recorded. This test is both sensitive and specific for acquired MG in people (incrcased
"jitter") and may hold prormise as a diagnostic test for that disease in dogs. Single-fiber EMG can
also be performed under sedation,versus general anesthesia
V.
Biopsy and Exploratory Surgery1858
A. Nerve and muscle biopsies are often performed in conjunction with electrodiagnostics. These should be
uscd to help characterize and diagnose neuropathies and myopathics.
B.Exploratory spinal surgery is performed when imaging techniques do not adequately charactcrize a
compressive spinal cord lesion or when biopsy and debulking or resection of a neoplastic lesion is
indicated.
C. Exploratory craniotomy is indicated for biopsy and debulking of neoplastic lesions seen on CT or MR
imaging. Stereotactic brain biopsy is becoming more widely available for diagnosis of intracranial lesions
without exploratory surgery.

ENCEPHALOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE BRAIN
Curtis W.Dewey

 Introduction
This chapter focuses on brain diseases other than head trauma and cerebellar disorders. These latter subjects
are discussed in detail in Chapters 6 and 9, respectively. There are a large number of diseases thiat can affect
the brain, the majority of which are discussed in this chapter. Seizures will be mentioned where appropriate,
but the important subject of seizure disorders and their management is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.
Many of the disease processes that affect the brain can cause dramatic clinical signs that can be very upset
ting to the owncr and even the clinician. However, many of these diseases can be successfully treated. The
clinician should be cautious not to rush into making prognostic decisions based primarily on clinical
appearance.

Clinical Signs of Brain Dysfunction (see also Chaprer 2)
A.Cercbrum/diencephalon (forebrain)
Dogs and cats with forebrain dysfunction may exhibit clinical signs tbat include altered mental status
(obrundation more likely than stupor or coma), behavioral changes, circling in a wide arc, head-pressing.
visual irnpairment, focal and/or gencralizcd scizure activity, and hemi-inartention (unilareral hemineglect)
syndrome. Conscious proprioceptive defcirs with. a normal to near-normal gait is characteristic of forebrain
dysfunction. Neck pain may be appreciable in patients with structural brain lesions.
B. Brain stem (caudal to the diencephalon)
Lesions from the midbrain (mesencephalon) through the medulla myelcncephalon) may lead to altered
mental status (stupor or coma more likely than with forebrain lesions), proprioccptive and gait abnormali-
ties, deficits in cranial nerves II-XIl, and central vestibular dysfunction.

a.This disease category comprises a wide variery of inherited (most are autosomal recessive)
abnormalities, which have in common the intracelular accumulation of one or more products of
an. inrerrupted degradative metabolic pathway. In the normal animal, substanccs that nced to bc
specific lysosomal enzymes. If one or more than one enzyme (acid hydrolase) in the chain of
degradation is absent or defectivc (c.g., deficiency of an activator protein for that enzyme,
deficiency of a lysosomal transport protein for the substance to be degraded), the substance prior
to that enzymatic step accumulates. The accumulated by-product(s) will lead to cellular dysfunc
tion, presumably due to cellular swelling, a toxic effecr of the accumulated material(s), or both.
In globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease), the deficient enzyme leads to the accumulation
of a sphingolipid called psychosine. Psychosine is toxic to oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, so
white matter in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems is
affccted. The lysosomal storage diseases are subdivided into groups in the table provided,

b. For most of these diseases, affected animals are normal at birth and develop a progressive multi-
focal to diffuse encephalopathy within the first several weeks to several months of life. Many of
the storage disorders have the common feature of cerebellar dysfunction as an early sign of
disease. Examples include mannosidosis, the gangliosidoses (GM, GM), globoid celeukodys-
trophy (Krabbe's disease), glucocerebrosidosis (Gaucher's disease), and sphingomyelinosis
(Niemann-Pick disease). Forebrain dysfunction predominates, at least in the early disease stages,
in neuronal glycoproteinosis (Lafora's disease), ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten's discasc), and

dementia) within the frst year of life. Ceroid lipofuscinosis and fucosidosis are unique among
the lysosomal storage disorders in their relatively late onset of clinical signs. Although clinical
signs of neurologic dysfunction occasionally occur in dogs less than 1 year of age for these two
diseases, disease onset is typically in young adult dogs. Encephalopathic signs of ceroid lipofusci-
nosis initially manifest at 1-2 years of age, although the age range of disease onset is 6 months
10 years. Behavior changcs and visual deficits are usually the first abnormalities noticed. The
disease typically progresses over one to several years to include neurologic abnormalities such as
seizures, ataxia, tremors, and hypermetric gait. Both cats reported with ceroid lipofuscinosis
exhibited rapid deterioration of neurologic status. A form of ceroid lipofuscinosis that selectively
involves neurons in the cerebellum and thalamus of adult dogs has been described. These dogs
logic dysfunction in fucosidosis is 4-24 months, most dogs begin to exhibit signs of an abnor-
mality between 12 and 18 months of age. Forebrain dysfunction (e.g., behavior change, circling)
is evident initially and progresses over 23 years to include signs such as ataxia, dysphagia, vision
and hearing loss, nystagmus, and dysphonia. Enlargement of the ulnar nerves is often palpable in
dogs with fucosidosis. The cnargement is due both to edema and infltration of the nerves with
lipid-filled phagocytes and Schwann cells.

Tentative diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease is based upon clinical signs of a progressive,
spinal fuid analysis is usually normal but may reveal increased protein levels with a normal cell
count.Abnormalities of the brain may be evident on CT (computed tomography) or MR
(magnetic resonance) imaging (e.g., ventriculomegaly, brain atrophy, abnormal brain tissue
density). Definitive diagnosis of a specific lysosomal storage disease is typically made by identif
cation of the storage product (antemortem or postmortem; Fig. 5.1), documenting the deficient
enzyme activity, and/or emonstrating the presence of the defective gene responsiblefor the
disease. Whole blood leukocytes, tissue biopsy samples (e.g., liver), or cultured fibroblasts can be
used to demonstrate storage material and assay for deficient lysosomal enzyme activity. In some
of the storage diseases (e.g., mannosidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis, fucosidosis), accumulated
storage product can be identifed in urine by using specific assays.For many of the lysosomal
storage diseases identifed in veterinary patients,the specifc geneticmutations responsible for the
enzyme deficiencies have been identified and sequenced. It is now possible to diagnose some of
the lysosomal storage diseases in dogs and cats by demonstrating the defective gene using a blood
sample.
5/ENCEPHALOPATHIES:DISORDERSOFTHEBRAIN

d.Treatment of lysosomal storage diseases is directed at rcducing the accumulation of cellular
storage products. Various methods are used in pcoplc to incrcase the specific deficient enzyme
activity in order to achieve this effect. They include bone marrow transplantation (transplanting
cells that produce the deficient enzyme), enzyme replacement therapy (recombinant enzyme
administered parenterally to the patient), and gene therapy (transferring normal copies of the
malfunctioning gene to the patient's cells for the specifc disease using a viral vector). It has been
shown that, in general, only about 5% of normal enzyme activity is necessary to prcvcnt or
reverse clinical signs associated with lysosomal storage diseases.Substrate reduction therapy
(administering drugs that inhibit enzymes that produce the accumulated product) is a method to
reduce the amount of substrate that should normally be degraded by the deficient enzyme. All of
these options are associated with problems such as autoimmune responses to a transplanted
foreign material, transient duration of effect, and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The
gene directly to the paticnts brain (either intrathecally or intraparenchymally) using a viral
vector. The functional copy of the gene becomes incorporated into the target cell, which then
begins to produce the deficient enzyme (cell transduction). This therapeutic approach has
recentlybeen shown tobeeffective in the treatmentoffeline Q-mannosidosis.
At present, the prognosis for animals with lysosomal storage diseases remains poor. For the
majority of these disorders, affcted animals are euthanized due to progressively worsening
neurologic dysfunction within the frst year of life.For the more slowly progressive disorders
(e.g., fucosidosis, ceroid lipofuscinosis), continuous neurologic dysfunction leads to death or
euthanasia usually within 1-2 years of diagnosis. Recent major advances in both molecular
diagnosis and gene transfer therapy for these disorders will probably lead to a more favorable
prognosis for lysosomal storage diseases in the near future.
2. Ieukodystophy/sp0ngy degeneration6282,26239,91,33,405,9,51.60.62631
a.The leukodystrophies are thought to be due to abnorimal synthesis (by oligodendrocytes) and/or
maintenance of myelin in the CNS. This is a diverse group of rare, poorly understood, suspected
heritable, progressive diseases. However, some of these enigmatic disorders are either suspected or
have been proven to be mitochondrial encephalopathies or organic acidurias (discussed in this
chapter). Some of these diseases produce clinical signs of a myelopathy rather than encephalopa-
thy, and these are discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 10). Leukodystrophy/spongy degeneration of
the brain has been described as primarily affecting the white matter in Labrador Retrievers,
Dalmatians, Silkie Terriers, Samoyeds, Shetland Sheepdogs, Bullmastiffs, a Scottish Terrier, a
Miniature Poodle, and Egyptian Mau cats. The white matter leukodystrophy in Bullmastiffs is a
unique disorder that appears to represent an oligodendroglial dysplasia, an inherited primary
disorder of oligodendroglial cells. Primarily, gray matter spongy degeneration has been described
in Bullmastiffs, Salukis, Malinois/Shepherd mixed-breed dogs, Cocker Spaniel littermates, and
Birman kittens.
b. Neurologic dysfunction typically begins within the first 6 months of life and progressively
worsens. Clinical signs are variable, depending upon breed, but may include visual defcits,
behavior changes, obtunded mental starus, seizures, cerebellar dysfunction (tremors, araxia),
dysphagia, paraparesis, and tetraparesis. Similar to lysosomal storage diseases, a multifocal/diffuse
disorder may be evident.
C.Tentative diagnosis is based upon typical clinical signs of dysfunction in a breed previously
reported with leukodystrophy/spongy degeneration.Since these are progressive,fatal diseases,
definitive diagnosis is based upon postmortem histologic findings of extensive CNS white matter
loss, often with attendant vacuolation of the brain tissue (spongiform change). In some cases (e.
g, Scottish Terrier, Miniature Poodle), astrocytic inclusion bodies, referred to as Rosenthal fbers,
are identified. These latter cases have been termed fibrinoid leukodystropby and are similar to a
leukodystrophy in people called Alexander's disease. Histopathologic findings in Sherland

unknown cause. Potential trearments and prognoses for various mitochondrial encephalopathies
and organic acidurias are discussed in those sections, respectively. The prognosis for the majority
of leukodystrophy/spongy degeneration disorders is typically grave.
3.Neuronal vacuolation and spinocerebellar degeneration in Rottweilers and Boxer
a.'This is a progressive, multifocal degenerative CNS disorder of unknown etiology. It has been
reported in 15 Rottweilers and 1 Rottweiler/German Shepherd cross. A nearly identical disorder
was recently reported in two Boxer dog littermates. In addition, a very similar disorder has been
reported in a mixed-brced dolichocephalic dog with no apparent parentage from either Rottwei-
ler or Boxer dog brceds. The hallmark of this disease is the histopathologic finding of intraneuro-
nal vacuoles primarily in the brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord gray matter. The vacuoles
are reminiscent of scrapic-associated spongiform change, but there is no evidence for an infec-
tious cause for this disease.In addition to widespread neuronal vacuolation in the CNS, axonal
necrosiswasdemonstratedprimarily affectingthedorsolateralandventromedialfuniculiofthe
cervical and thoracic spinal cord. Similar axonal necrosis has also been shown in the lumbar
wecks of age, most within 2 months of age. The Boxer dogs were presented at 6 months of age.
Affected puppies typically exhibit generalized weakness and ataxia (more prominent in the pelvic
limbs), with a hypermetric gait. Proprioceptive placing reactions are abnormal. With the excep-
tion of one dog with hyporcflexive patellar reflexes, the spinal reflexes remain intact. A consistent
clinical feature of the disease is inspiratory stridor, due to laryngeal nerve dysfunction. Other
frequent abnormalities include positional strabismus, intention head tremor, and nystagmus.
Pharyngeal dysfunction has also been reported. Some dogs with this disorder had concurrent
congenital ocular abnormalities (cataracts, persistent pupillary membrane, microophthalmia,
retinal dysplasia). Clinical signs progress over several weeks to include worsening of the paresis,
laryngeal and pharyngeal dysfunction, and development of behavioral changes (in some dogs).
C.A tentative diagnosis is based upon the typical clinical signs and progression in a young Rottwei
disorder.
d. There is no treatment, and the prognosis is grave. With the exception of one dog who survived
for 9months following onset of clinical signs, these dogs were all euthanized within several
a.A number of breeds have been described with suspected neuronal abiotrophy. Abiotropby refers to
premature death of cells, presumably due to the lack of some factor necessary for celular sur-
vival. Most of the abiorrophics described cause signs primarily or exclusively related to cerebellar
dysfunction. A group of related, red-haired Cocker Spaniels has been described with suspected
neuronal abiotrophy. These dogs exhibited signs of both forebrain and cerebellar dysfunction.
b.The reported dogs developed clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction at approximately 1 year of
age.The clinical signs refect both forebrain and cerebellar dysfunction and include behavior
change, generalized seizures, intention tremor, ataxic and hypermetric gait, circling, vision lss,
and proprioceptive deficits. The disease progresses slowly over several months.
C.Tentative diagnosis is based on clinical signs of a progressive multifocal/diffuse encephalopathy in
a Cocker Spaniel dog. Definitive diagnosis is attained histopathologically. Widespread neuronal
cell loss is evident throughout the brain in affected dogs.

d.Although this disorder is slowly progressive, there is no treatment,and the prognosis is
grave.
5.Cognitive dysfunction
a.An age-related syndrome similar to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in people occurs in elderly dogs and
cats. Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) is best described for the dog, and this species
appears to be the best animal model available for hurman AD. Similar to AD of people, the
pathophysiology of CDS is uncertain. There are pathologic similarities between the brains of
humans with AD and dogs and cats with CDS. Cerebral vascular changes, meningeal thickening.
gliosis, and ventricular dilatation occur in brains of both AD and CDS patients. More specif-
cally, the progressive accumulation of a neurotoxic protein called beta-amyloid in the brain (in
and around neurons) is a consistent feature in both AD and CDS. These accumulations coalesce
to form plaques (neuritic plaques) and are most prominent in the frontal cerebral cortex and in
the hippocampus in both human and veterinary disorders. In both disorders, the degree of beta
amyloid accumulation correlates with the extent of cognitive impairment. In addition to the
accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein in the aged canine and feline brain,
intraneuronal accumulation of a hyperphosphorylated microtubular-associated protcin (tau
protein) has also been demonstrated. Tau protein is the precursor to neurofbrillary tangles
(NFT), another prominent histopathological feature of human AD. The absencc of mature NFTs
in the brains of dogs and cats with CDS has been argued as evidence against CDS of dogs and
cats being analogous to human AD. However, the absence of NFTs in dogs and cats has a
number of potential explanations. It is possible that dogs and cats do not live long enough for
thc tau proteins to develop into NFTs as they do in people. While the amino acid sequence of
Aβ protcin is identical between humans and dogs, this is not the case for tau protcin.The amino
acid sequence of dogs and cats differs from that in people; this different sequence may affect the
ability of tau protein to form NFTs. Other structural abnormalities found in the aging canine
brain that are similar to those in humans include cerebral atrophy, ventricular enlargement,
blood vessel wall fibrosis and amyloid deposition (meningeal and parenchymal), microhemor-
rhages and infarcts, axonal degeneration with myelin loss, astroglial hypertrophy and hyperplasia,
and intraneuronal accumulation of several substances (lipofuscin, polyglucosan bodies, and
ubiquitin). The pathophysiology of CDS and AD is multifactorial and complex. There is evi
dence in both diseases that increased oxygen-free radical-mediated cellular damage, dccreased
endogenous antioxidant defenses, infammation (from various processes), decreased mitochon-
drial function, DNA damage, vascular compromise, and neurotransmitter imbalance are all
Neurochemical changes that occur in the aging brain are thought to contribute to progres-
sive cognitive impairment. An age-associated decline in the brain neurotransmitter levels of
acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been
documented in CDS and AD. Of these abnormalities, cholinergic dysfunction appears to have
the highest and most consistent correlation with age-related cognitive impairment. Other neuro-
chemical abnormalities identified in brains of CDS and AD patients include increascd acetylcho-
linesterase levels (associared with cholinergic decline), increased monoamine oxidase B (catalyzes
the breakdown of dopamine, with subsequent formation of free radicals), and elevated cerebro-
spinal fuid (CSF) levels of lactate, pyruvate, and potassium.

These categories are successful aging, mild cognitive impairment, and severe cognitive impair-
ment (dementia). The third, most severe category is consistent with a diagnosis of AD. Standard-
ized cognitive testing of older dogs (almost exclusively done in a research setting) has enabled a
more objective determination of the extent of cognitive dysfunction in individuals, as well as the
response to therapeutic interventions. In addition to the classic behavioral abnormalities indica-
tive of CDS in dogs, the author has occasionally encountered suspected CDS dogs with either
transient central vestibular dysfunction or seizure activity of recent onset.Although not yet
reported as a clinical feature of canine CDS,vestibulocerebellar dysfunction and seizures are
reported as a potential consequence of AD in people.
C.
Similar to AD in people, a diagnosis of CDS in a dog or cat is based primarily on historical
diagnosis of CDS, the clinician should rule out other potential causes of cognitive dysfunction,
such as metabolic disorders (e.g, hepatic encephalopathy) and structural brain disorders (e.g.
brain tumor). In AD, CT or MR imaging of the brain is usually performed as part of the
diagnostic workup and should ideally be part of the diagnostic plan for CDS patients. Brain
imaging of AD patients can be normal, but may reveal brain atrophy, ventricular enlargement,
and lesions in the medial temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 5.2). Age-related changes
appreciated on MR imaging of the brain in CDS patients are primarily reflective of brain
atrophy and include ventricular enlargement, widened and well-demarcated cerebral sulci, and
diffuse and scattered areas of T2-hyperintensity in periventricular white matter. Although these

progression of cognitive decline. The use of oral L-deprenyl (selegiline), an irreversible inhibitor
of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), has been purported to improve cognitive function and slow
progression of the disease in the majority of dogs and cats with CDS. There is considerable
variability in the degree of response achieved among patients, however. L-deprenyl is thought to
exert its beneficial effects in the brain by restoring dopaminergic balance, as well as enhancing
catecholamine levels and decreasing levels of damaging free radical species. The dosage for dogs is
0.5-1.0 mg/kg q 24 hours. Cats are administered 0.5 mg/kg q 24 hours. Most patients will
exhibit a positive response within the first month of therapy. Despite apparent positive responses
of both canine and feline CDS patients to selegilene, there is some evidence that this drug does
not have a significant effect on cognitive function in these patients or in people with AD.The
clinical efficacy studies supporting selegilene use in CDS are based primarily on owner response
to questionnaires rather than on standardized comparative cognitive testing procedures of treated
and untreated patients. Since selegilene may produce nonspecific low-level hyperactivity by
increasing brain catecholamine levels, the “response” observed by owners may not truly be
representative of improved cognitive ability. Selegiline is not considered an effective drug for
human AD due to variable responses and overall minimum improvement of cognitive function.

drugs that theoretically can improve cognitive function by improving cerebral blood How. There
is little to no evidence of efficacy for thesc two drugs. The noradrenergic-enhancing drugs

thc use of GABA-ergic drugs, such as gabapentin. Because infammatory changes have been
identifed in the brains of CDS dogs, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g, carprofen) has
also been proposed. Finally, a large nunber of complimentary therapies have been suggested for
the treatment of CDS, with the primary goals of calming the patient, reducing anxiety and
normalizing the sleep/wake cycle. Thcsc include mclatonin, valerian root, dog-appcasing phero
mone (DAP), phosphatidylserinc, ginkgo biloba, DHA (an omega 3 fatty acid), and various
antioxidants and mitochondrial cofactors. The evidence for efficacy of all these complimentary
therapies is cntirely anecdotal.
There is convincing evidence that providing a diet fortified with antioxidants, mitochondrial
cofactors, and essential faty acids improves cognitive function and delays cognitive decline in
dogs with CDS. This commercially available diet (Hills b/d) contains a mixture of fruits and
vegetables, in addition to vitamins C and E, and mitochondrial cofactors (L-carnitine, DL-Q-
lipoic acid).
Environmental enrichment, such as regular exercise and introduction of new toys, has also
been demonstrated to iinprove cognitivc function and delay cognitive decline in dogs with CDS.
Progresion of CDS appears to be more rapid in castratcd versus intact male dogs, suggesting a
potcntial role for hornmone replacciment therapy in this discase. The prognosis for CDS is
guarded. Most affectcd patients are euthanized within 18-24 months of onset of clinical signs,
either due to progressive cognitive impairment or unassociated medical prohlems.

'The pathophysiology of CNS darmage associated with hydrocephalus is complex and involves
destruction of the ependymal lining of the ventriclcs, ncuronal injury in the cerebral cortex,
compromise of cerebral vasculaturc, and damage to periventricular white matter. The phenom
cnon of cxcessive CSF in the ventricular system of the brain occurs commonly in young dogs,
especially of the toy and brachycephalic breeds, and less commonly in cats. Congenital hydro
cephalus is most commonly reported in dogs, especially snall breeds (c.g., Chiuahua, Yorkshire
Terrier, Maltese, Boston Terrier, English Bulldog, Toy/Miniature Poodic, Lhasa Apso, Pomera-
nian, Pekingese). Congenital hydrocephalus may bc an autosomal recessively inhcritcd trait in the
Siamese cat. T'he list of potential causes for congenital hydrocephalus (i.e., evident from birth) is
divcrsc and cxtensive and involves disturbances to the developing fetus or the neonate, including
the following: intraventricular hcmorrhage (e.g., dystocia relatcd); viral infections (e.g. parainflut-
A); and heritable malformations. Ventriculomegaly results from obstruction of CSF How within
CSF into the venous system at the arachnoid villi level.
It is the rule, rather than the exception, that a specific cause for congenital hydrocephalus is
not apparent at the time of clinical presentation; this lack of an active causative process (e.g.
inflammation, hemorrhage) helps define this form of hydrocephalus. Hycrocephalus, especially if
progressive, can cause neurologic dysfunction from compression and stretching of brain paren-
chiyima, as well as from brain ischenia and intcrstitial cdema. Many animals, especially of the
predisposed breeds, have hydroccphalus based upon ventricular enlargement yet have no discern
iblc ncurologic dysfunction. Therc is generally an inconsistent relationship between the extent of

ventricular dilation and clinical signs of diseasein most of thesebreeds,so clinicalhydrocephalus
should not be diagnosed on imaging findings alone. One study, however, evaluated both ven
tricular-to-brain ratio (VB ratio) and basilar artery resistive index (RI) via Doppler ultrasonogra-
phy in dogs with ventriculomegaly and varying signs of neurologic dysfunction. It was found
that RI and VB ratio were both significantly higher in clinically hydrocephalic dogs compared
with dogs having ventriculomegaly and no signs of neurologic dysfunction. Combining these
measurements provided a sensitivity and specificity of identifying clinical hydrocephalic patients
of 77% and 94%, respectively. In addition, it was found that RI changed with changes in
ratio of more than 60% eventually developed clinical hydrocephalus. Although hydrocephalus
typically denotes dilation of the internal ventricular system, external hydrocephalus occasionally
occurs in people and has been described in dogs and cats. In this text, a patient is considered to
have congenital hydrocephalus only if all three of these criteria are met: (1) ventriculomegaly is
demonstrated; (2) there is no active, potentially causal disease process identifiable; and (3) the
patient exhibits clinical signs of brain dysfunction.Hydrocephalus may exist concurrentlywith
other anomalous conditions that affect the CSF pathways, such as Dandy-Walker syndrome
(DWS), caudal occipital malformation syndrome (COMS, also termed Chiari type I malforma-
tion), and syringomyelia (typically associated with COMS).
b.Dogs and cats with congenital hydrocephalus typically are presented for signs of neurologic
dysfunction within the first 6 months of life. The rate of clinical progression of congenital
hydrocephalus is highly variable, and a considerable proportion of hydrocephalic animals may
not develop clinical signs of encephalopathy until adulthood. Common physical characteristics of
hydrocephalic patients include a large, dome-shaped head, open fontanelles or larger calvarial
defects, and bilateral ventrolateral strabismus (Fig. 5.4). The strabismus may be due to orbital
skull malformations rather than to vestibular dysfunction and has been referred to as the “setting
sun sign." Clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction usually reflect a forebrain disorder and include
obtundation, behavior abnormalities, circling, pacing, restlessness, and seizure activity. In the
author's experience, seizures are not commonly associatedwith congenitalhydrocephalus as
compared with behavioral abnormalities and abnormal mentation. In one report of hydrocephalic
Maltese dogs, less than 20% exhibited seizures. Some hydrocephalic patients may also exhibit
vestibular and/or cerebellar dysfunction. Concurrent congenital abnormalities of the brain (e.g.

for cerebellovestibular dysfunction.
c.Diagnosis of congenital hydrocephalus is based upon a combination of characteristic clinical
features, demonstration of ventriculomegaly, and the absence of other causes of encephalopathy.
Ultrasonography (through open fontanelles or calvarial defects) and advanced imaging (CT/MRI;
Fig. 5.5) have largely supplanted more invasive methods of documenting ventriculomegaly (e.g.,.
contrast ventriculography). Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used historically to assist in
the diagnosis of congenital hydrocephalus,with affected patients typically exhibiting slow-
frequency, high-voltage activity. However, these EEG findings are relatively nonspecific and
seldom contribute much to the diagnosis of congenital hydrocephalus.
d.Medical treatment of congenital hydrocephalus is aimed at reduction of CSF production. Oral
prednisone, at an initial dosage of 0.25-0.50 mg/kg, q 12 hr, may decrease CSF production.
Prednisone should be reduced over several weeks to the lowest possible dosage required to control
clinical signs.Furosemide,a loop diuretic,decreases CSFproduction via inhibition of the

weight PO, q 12-24 hr.The diuretic acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and is
typically dosed at 10 mg/kg body weight PO, q 6-8 hr. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor,
has been shown to decrease CSF production in dogs by 26%. The oral dose for dogs is 10 mg/kg
(dogs weighing less than 20 kg) q 24 hr and 20 mg/kg (dogs weighing more than 20 kg) q 24 hr.
For all of these drugs,it is recommended that the dose be tapered to the lowest dose needed to
control clinical signs of disease in order to avoid serious side effects. Anticonvulsant drugs are
administered if the patient is experiencing seizure activity. Medical therapy of congenital hydro-
cephalus may provide some level of disease palliation in mild cases, but often fails in the long
term.The potential side effects of long-term corticosteroid and/or diuretic therapy should be
considered along with the questionable effcacy of medical therapy for congenital hydrocephalus
when making treatment decisions. Electrolyte depletion (especially potassium) and dehydration
are concerns when using diuretics for prolonged time periods,particularly when combined with
corticosteroids.Thegoal of surgical treatmentofhydrocephalus is to continually divert excessive
CSF from theventricles of the brain to either the peritoneal cavity or the right atrium of the
heart.Bothventriculoatrial andventriculoperito
neal shunts (Fig.5.6)havebeen successfully
cally more feasible than ventriculoatrial shunt placement, especially in very small patients (Fig.
5.7). The prognosis for dogs and cats with congenital hydrocephalus is variable but is generally
guarded.Medical therapy may be effective in some patients,whereas others require surgical
improvement in neurologic status after surgical shunting procedures varies in the literature from
50% to 90%for dogs.In the author's experience,the success rate is approximately 75%-80%.
Potential postoperative surgical shunt complications in dogs and cats include shunt obstruction,
shunt dislodgement, mechanical damage to the shunt, and shunt infection.
2.Caudal occipital malformation
a. Caudal occipital malformation syndrome is the canine analog of Chiari type I malformation of
people. Although only recently described in dogs, COMS appears to be a very common neuro-
logic disorder in this species.This disease is almost exclusive to small breed dogs,with the
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) being the most overrepresented. There is convincing
evidencein the CKCSbreed that COMS is aheritable disease,although the exact mode of
inheritancehasnotbeen determined.Otherbreeds commonly encounteredwith COMSinclude
Miniature/ToyPoodle,Yorkshire Terrier,Maltese,Pug dog,Pomeranian,and Pekingese
130

Anecdotally, the author and colleagues have encountered a similar condition in an American
Staffordshire Terrier and three cats (one Persian, two exotic shorthair). The disorder is a congeni-
tal malformation of the caudal occipital region of the skull, leading to overcrowding of the
caudal fossa and compression of the cervicomedullary junction at the level of the foramen
magnum (Fig. 5.8). The vast majority of dogs with COMS have syringomyelia (usually in the
cervical spinal cord), an accumulation of fuid within the spinal cord, as a consequence of the
malformation. In patients with COMS, there tends to be some level of cerebellar compression as
well as constriction of the cervicomedullary junction in the vicinity of the foramen magnum.
With chronic bony compression at the cervicomedullary junction, and probable turbulent CSF
fow and pressure changes in this region, it is thought that the underlying meninges become
hypertrophied with time. In both humans with Chiari type I and dogs with COMS, there is
pathological evidence of dural fibrosis in the region of the malformation. In COMS, as in Chiari
type I of people, the caudal aspect of the cerebellum is often projecting into or through (hernia-
tion) the foramen magnum, contributing to obstruction of CSF fow between intracranial and
spinal compartments. Progressive alterations in pressure dynamics between the intracranial and
spinal compartments are believed to be responsible for the development of clinical signs of
COMS.Although aberrant pressure dynamics due to obstruction of CSF pathways at the level of
the foramen magnum are generally agreed to cause syringomyelia in COMS, the exact mecha-
nism of this development is unknown, and there are multiple theories proposed to explain it.
Many of these theories operate on the probably incorrect premise that the syringomyelia fuid is
CSF that is forced into the central canal of the spinal cord. The newer theories suggest that the
syringomyelia fuid is actually derived from extracellular fuid from the cord itself, either driven
into the central canal via a pulse pressure wave from behind the foramen magnum obstruction
and/or drawn into the central canal via a centrifugally directed hydrostatic pressure force within
the spinal cord. In normal dogs, there is pulsatile CSF fow across the foramen magnum from
intracranial subarachnoid space to cervical spinal subarachnoid space and back again during
systole and diastole,respectively.With an obstruction at the foramen magnum as occurs with
COMS, CSF does not fow well in either direction. In this scenario, the pressure exerted during
systole may drive either CSF or a pressure wave from the intracranial compartment into the
central canal region of the cranial crvical spinal cord, causing it to progressively expand. This
has been referred to as the“water hammer”effect.Another theory proposed is that CSF is
“sucked” into the central canal region of the cervical spinal cord, especially during maneuvers

that lead to sudden incrcascs in intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure (e.g, coughing,
sneezing, exercising). These Valsalva maneuvers lead secondarily to increased intracranial and
intraspinal pressure via epidural venous distension. Because intracranial pressure is higher than in
the cervical cord region, CSF fuid is drawn into the cervical cord when there are rapid increases
in pressure. Pressure within the spinal compartment tends to increase more rapidly in the lumbar
versus cervical regions, further promoting CSF movement into the cervical cord via this “suck”
effect. The “slosh” phenomenon may also be involved in expansion of a syrinx. With distension
of epidural veins during Valsalva events, CSF fows more freely within the syrinx than in the
compressed subarachnoid space.Therefore, sudden CSF pressure waves cause CSF within the
syrinx cavity to “slosh” around, fissuring surrounding parenchyma and enlarging the syrinx. The
combination of spinal cpidural vein distension (and resultant pressurization of the subarachnoid
space) and obstruction to CSF fow from the cervical spine to the intracranial compartment may
also result in forcing subarachnoid CSF down perivascular spaces into the spinal cord paren-
chyma, progressively enlarging the syrinx. It has also becn proposed that the displaced caudal
cerebellum acts like a piston. The piston theory proposes that the displaced cerebellum moves
further caudally during systole, obstructing the subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum and
exaggerating the systolic pulse pressure wave that is transmitted from intracranial to spinal
compartments; this further forces CSF through perivascular spaces into the syrinx.Although all
of the above theories may contribute to the development of a syrinx,none of them are adequate
explanations for this phenomenon.It has been shown that the syrinx usually has a higher
pressure than the subarachnoid space, which would argue against theories that propose CSF is
being forced or sucked into a low-pressure system from a higher-pressure system. In addition,
syrinx fuid is not identical to CSF Auid; it has a lower protein concentration and is more
consistent with extracellular fuid. Several related theories have been proposed that are more
likely to adequately explain the pathogenesis of syringomyelia formation with COMS or Chiari
type I malformation. The intramedullary pulse pressure theory proposes that the spinal cord
parenchyma distal to the foramen magnum compression is subjected to distending forces that
tend to pull the tissue in an outward or centrifugal direction.The combination of transmittal of
the systolic pulse pressure wave to the spinal cord parenchyma (due to obstruction of the sub-
arachnoid space) and decreased subarachnoid space pressure in the spinal cord region (due to
obstruction of the subarachnoid space rostral to the foramen magnum) lead to this mechanical
distension. Over time, the distension leads to a cavity formation (syrinx), which is filled with
extracellular fuid.TheVenruri effect describes a similar mcchanical spinal cord distension caused
by increased CSF velocity distal to an obstruction. The obstruction (i.e., foramen magnum
occlusion in COMS) causes a narrowing of the subarachnoid space and a resultant increased
fuid velocity distal to the obstruction. This increased velocity lowers the hydrostatic pressure,
producing a centrifugally directed suction effect and leading to spinal cord distension. This
thcory also assumes that the accumulated fuid in the syrinx is extracellular fluid and at a higher
pressure than the subarachnoid space. Finally, there is a vascular theory to explain the develop-
ment of syringomyelia in COMS cases. With increased CSF pressure in the intracranial compart-
ment versus the spinal compartment due to forarnen magnum obstruction (especially during
Valsalva maneuvers and systole), the venous and capillary beds become collapsed in the intracra-
nial region and distended in the cervical spinal cord region (caudal to the obstruction). This
occurs because CSF and venous pressure normally remain closely matched in both cranial and
spinal compartments, and the venous system does not become obstructed as does the subarach-
noid space with foramen magnum obstruction. With foramen magnum compression,the trans-
mural pressure (difference between intravascular and interstitial pressure) of the venous and
capillary system on either side of the obstruction is no longer uniform throughout the spinal
cord. The uneven vascular expansion and contraction that ensues causes damage to the surround-
ing spinal cord. This hydrostatic stress-mediated damage to the spinal cord disrupts the blood-
133
spinal cord barrier, promoting the accumulation of extracellular fuid within the spinal cord (i.e.,
syrinx development). Common to all theories of syrinx development in COMS is the causative
factor of obstruction of normal CSF fow at the foramen magnum.
b. Most dogs with COMS are presented for evaluation as young adults, between 3 and 6 years of
age. However, the age range for this disorder is very broad, ranging from less than 6 months to
more than 12 years of age. Dogs that are present
nted at lessthan 2yearsofageoftenhavemore
severe clinical signs than older dogs. Similar to Chiari type I of humans, there is a wide spectrum
of possible neurologic presentations for dogs with COMS,including cervical myelopathy,
cerebellovestibular dysfunction, and forebrain dysfunction (e.g, seizure activity).By far, evidence
ofcervical dysfunction andcerebellovestibular dysfunction are themostcommon and are often
both present (e.g., multifocal CNS disease). Most of the COMS cases that the author encounters
subtle signs of central vestibular dysfiunction are apparent on neurologic examination. Occasion-
ally, dogs with COMS and cervical syringomyelia present with a specific variant of cervical
myelopathy called centralcord syndrome.In this syndrome,the outwardly expanding syrinx causes
more lower motor neuron (LMN) damage to the thoracic limb musculature than white matter
damage (to pelvic limbs); the result is thoracic limb paresis (often LMN in nature) that is
notably worse than pelvic limb paresis. In some cases, the pelvic limbs may appear normal. Some
specific clinical findings in dogs with COMS include cervical and cranial hyperesthesia, decreased
menace responses with normal vision,positionalventrolateral strabismus,thoraciclimb weakness,
pelvic limb ataxia, persistent scratching (at the head,neck, and shoulder region--often without
making skin contact), scoliosis, facial nerve paresis/paralysis (unilateral or bilateral), and hearing
abnormalities. The persistent scratching activity and scoliosis are fairly unique clinical signs
associated with syringomyelia. In the author's experience, these are more commonly encountered
in the CKCS breed than in other breeds with COMS and syringomyelia. The scratching activity
is believed to be due to the syrinx interfering with spinothalamic tracts and/or dorsal horn
neurons, resulting in abnormal sensations (dysesthesia/paresthesia). Scoliosis (torticollis) is most
likely due to asymmetric syrinx damage to sensory proprioceptive neurons innervating cervical
musculature; an alternative, less likely hypothesis is syrinx damage to LMNs innervating cervical
musculature.Scratchingactiviry andneckdiscomfort oftenare exacerbated by abruptweather
changes, stress or excitement, and physical contact with the neck/shoulder region (e.g., collar).
'The presence of both pain and scoliosis has been shown to be significantly correlated with syrinx
width in CKCS dogs with syringomyelia secondary to COMS. It is important to rcalize that,
cspecially in the CKCS brecd, other conditions may account for some of the clinical signs. An
enigmatic ear problem of the CKCS breed, called primary secretory otitis media (PSOM) has been
described. Clinical signs of PSOM include apparent pain around the head and neck area,
scratching of the head and neck, facial paralysis, and head tilt. Idiopathic epilepsy is also a
prevalent disorder in the CKCS breed. Seizures have been reported to occur in 10%-12% of
humans with Chiari type I malformation; in the author's experience, seizure activity is an infre-
quenr concurrent occurrence in COMS cases, and it is usually not possible to distinguish
whether this is due to COMS or concurrent idiopathic epilepsy. Congenital deafncss is also well-
described in the CKCS breed. The severity and rate of progression of COMS in dogs is variable,
ranging from asymptomatic (i.e., finding evidence of COMS while imaging for some other
reason) to extreme pain and debilitation with rapid worsening. In addition, some dogs with
COMS have other concurrent disorders (e.g., disk extrusion, infammatory brain disease) that
could explain observed clinical signs.In such situations, it may be difficult to discern if the
COMS is the main problem, is contributory, or is an incidental finding.
C.Diagnosis of COMS is made by MR imaging (Fig. 5.9). Magnetic resonance imaging is also the
visualized on a midsagittal view (preferably T2-weighted), which includes the caudal fossa and

cranial cervical cord. Consistent findings on MR imaging indicative of COMS are attenuation/
obliteration of the dorsal subarachnoid space at the cervicomedullary junction and rostral
displacement of the caudal cerebellum by the occipital bone. Other common MR imaging
findings in COMS include syringomyelia (usually C2 level caudally), herniation of the caudal
cerebellum through the foramen magnum, and a *kinked” appearance of the caudal medulla.
Phase-contrast MRI (cine-MRI) is often used to measure CSF fow in humans with Chiari type I
malformation and has recently been evaluated for use in dogs with COMS. Occasionally, dogs
with MR imaging findings consistent with COMS will have evidence of other congenital disor-
ders such as intracranial arachnoid (quadrigeminal) cyst, malformation of the C1 and/or C2
vertebrae, and hydrocephalus. In the author's opinion,most small breed dogs normally have large
lateral ventricles as a breed characteristic (ventriculomegaly) and are not hydrocephalic. In the
absence of concurrent disease processes, CSF analysis is usually normal; occasionally, a mild
mononuclear pleocytosis will be apparent, however. Because of the prevalence of COMS in the
CKCS breed and the high cost of MR imaging, there is a need for screening tests to evaluate
litters of puppies. The author has found brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) testing to
be a useful screening test in adult dogs with COMS. It is unknown how well this test will
perform in screening young animals with the disorder.
d.Treatment of COMS can be divided into medical and surgical therapy. In people with symptom-
atic Chiari type I malformation, surgical therapy is considered the treatment of choice,with
foramen magnum decompression (FMD) being the preferred surgical procedure. Adjunctive
surgical procedures are occasionally performed in people who have had a suboptimal response to
FMD; such procedures usually involve placement of a shunt to divert syringomyelia fuid from
the spinal cord region to another location for absorption (e.g., pleural or peritoneal cavity,

type I malformation in people, there is a re-operative rate varying from 8% to 30% for FMD;
the most common problem necessitating re-operation is excessive scar tissue formation at the
FMD site causing compression at the cervicomedullary junction, effectively recreating the
original disease state.
Medical therapy for dogs with COMS generally fall into three categories: analgesic drugs
(implies relief of dysesthesia/paresthesia also), drugs that decrease CSF production, and cortico-
steroid therapy. By far the most useful drug available for relief of scratching activity associated
with syringomyelia is gabapentin (10 mg/kg body weight PO, q 8 hr). It has been shown that
gated calcium channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons and dorsal horn nociceptive neurons of
the spinal cord. Gabapentin, and the newer gabapentin analog, pregabalin, are believed to exert
their antinociceptive effects by selectively binding to the Q28-1 subunit and inhibiting calcium
influx in these neurons. Side effects of gabapentin are minimal, usually restricted to mild

sedation, pelvic limb ataxia, and weight gain.There is no information available conccrning the
use of pregabalin in dogs. A dose of 24 mg/kg body weight PO, q 8-12 hours has been sug-
gested, based on preliminary pharmacokinetic data in normal dogs collected by the author and
colleagues. Whether pregabalin is more effective or has fewer side effects compared with gabap-
entin is unknown. Orally administered opiate drugs are sometimes helpful in alleviating neck
and head pain in COMS dogs. The author has had success using oral tramadol (24 mg/kg, q
8-12 hr). A number of drugs aimed at decreasing CSF production have been used in COMS
patients in an effort to diminish the CSF pulse pressure. All information regarding efficacy of
these drugs is anecdotal. They include omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor), acetazolamide (a
carbonic anhydrase inhibitor), and furosemide (a loop diuretic). More specific information
regarding these drugs is covered in the congenital hydrocephalus discussion. Corticosteroids are
often used in medical management of COMS. Potential benefits include anti-inflammatory
effects, decreased CSF production, and decreased substance P (a nociceptive neurotransmitter)
expression in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. An initial anti-inflammatory dose of 0.5 mg/kg
PO, q 12 hr is often effective in controlling clinical signs. This dose should be tapered, if at all
possible,to an every-other-day schedule within the first month of therapy.In most cases of
COMS, medical therapy will diminish the severity of clinical signs, but resolution is unlikely.
The preferred surgical procedure for treatment of COMS in dogs is FMD. Based on two
similar reports, short-term surgical success rates with FMD in dogs with COMS are approxi-
mately 80%. One report found an inverse relationship between the length of time clinical signs
were present prior to surgical intervention and the cxtcnt of postoperative improvement. Unfor-
tunately, there appears to be a disease relapse rate ranging from 25% to 47% of cases; most of
these relapses are suspected to be due to excessive postoperative scar tissue formation at the FMD
site. In most cases, clinical signs of pain are routinely relieved with surgery, but scratching
activity tends to persist. Reccntly, the author has adapted a cranioplasty procedure used in
human FMD surgery to discourage excessive postoperative scar tissue from recompressing the
operative site (Fig. 5.11). Although results are preliminary, the cranioplasty procedure appears to
have substantially decreased the re-operation rate for this disorder in dogs.
There is litle information regarding the prognosis for COMS in dogs. Most dogs with
COMS will respond favorably to medical therapy, although in many cases this response is
temporary. In one group of 10 COMS dogs treated medically, 5 dogs were euthanized within 2
years due to disease progression and diminished responsiveness to therapy. In another study, 36%
of COMS dogs treated medically were euthanized due to clinical signs of their disease at a mean
of 1.7 years from the time of diagnosis. Although the surgical success rate is generally favorable
for COMS in dogs,the rccurrence rate due to excessive postoperative scar tissue forrmation is
unacceptably high. It is hoped that refinements in surgical technique, such as cranioplasty, will
ameliorate this problem. In general, the overall prognosis for COMS in dogs is guarded to good
for sustained improvement in clinical signs.
3. Intracranial arachn0id cyst 1.118.19,14125.35,38,447,494,602,603
a.Intracranial arachnoid cyst (IAC; also termed intra-aracbnoid cyst and quadrigeminal cyst) is a
developmental brain disorder in which cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) is thought to accumulate within
a split of the arachnoid membrane during embryogenesis. The developing neural tube is sur-
rounded by a loose layer of mesenchymal tissue called the perimedullary mesh; this tissue eventu-
ally becomes the pia and arachnoid layers of the meninges. In normal development, pulsatile
CSF fow from the choroid plexuses is thought to divide the perimedullary mesh into pia and
arachnoidlayers,effectively creating the subarachnoid space.It ispostulated that some aberration
of CSF fow from the choroid plexuses during this stage of development forces a separation
within the forming arachnoid layer, eventually leading to the creation of an IAC. The intra-
arachnoid location of IACs has been demonstrated via light and electron miscroscopy in people.
The mechanisms by which an IAC continues to expand with fuid are unknown, bur several

theories have been proposed. Fluid may be secreted by the arachnoid cells lining the cyst cavity.
There is evidence that cells lining the IAC may have secretory capacity. There may also be fuid
movement into the cystvia an osmotic pressure gradient. Considering that the fuid within the
IAC is nearly identical to CSF, this theory is unlikely.In addition,there have been documented
cases in people in which small slits exist between the IAC and the subarachnoid space; these slits
act as one-way valves, diverting CSF into the cyst during systole, which cannot return to the
subarachnoid space during diastole.
Although IAC has been reported to occur in several locations in humans, all reported canine
cases have been in the caudal fossa. Because IAC is typically associated with the quadrigeminal
cistern in dogs, these accumulations of fuid are often called quadrigeminal cysts in this species. A
similar structure was reported in a 1-year-old cat, based upon MR imaging of the patient. The
author has also observed a similar cystic condition in a kitten.Also termed intracranial intra-
arachnoid cyst, IAC accounts for 1% of all intracranial masses in people and has been sporadically
reported in dogs. Intracranial arachnoid cyst is often an incidental finding in humans; it has
ture, there have been nine clinical reports of IAC in dogs, with a total of 53 cases. The IAC was
suspected tobe an incidental fnding in approximately one-third to over one-half of the reported
cases. The vast majority of reported IAC cases in dogs have been small breeds, with a predomi-
nance of brachycephalic dogs. The breeds reported to date include Shih Tzu (12), Maltese (4),
Pug (4), CKCS (4), Yorkshire Terrier (4), Lhasa Apso (4), Chihuahua (3), Staffordshire Bull
Terrier (3), Buldog (3), Pekingese (2), West Highland White Terrier (2), and one each of Bichon
Frise,Pomeranian,Cairn Terrier,JackRussell Terrier,terrier mix,Beagle,Miniature Schnauzer,
and German Shorthaired Pointer.
b. There is a wide age range at clinical presentation for dogs with IAC (2 months to 10 years), with
forebrain (including seizure activity) and/or central vestibular (cerebellovestibular) dysfunction.
C. Diagnosis of IAC is typically made via CT or (preferably) MRI. Intracranial arachnoid cysts can
also be visualized using ultrasound imaging (via foramen magnum, temporal window, and/or

is a large, well-demarcated fuid-filled structure, isointense with the CSF spaces and located
between the caudal cerebrum and rostral cerebellum (Fig. 5.12). Because IAC may be an inci-
dental finding, it is important to rule out concurrent infammatory disease (i.e., CSF examina-
tion). In the author's opinion, it is often diffcult or impossible to discern whether IAC in the
presence of another brain disorder is purely an incidental finding. Since the presence of a large,
uid-filled structurewithin the cranial vault likely decrcases intracranial compliance,some of
these IACs may be contributory rather than an incidental finding.As this disorder is believed to
represent a developmental abnormality of the intracranial ventricular CSF system, it may occur
concurrently with other fuid abnormalities (e.g., congenital hydrocephalus). The cyst may or
may not communicate with theremainder of theventricular system.When facedwith evidence
of IAC and another disease (e.g., granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis [GME]) in the same
patient, optimal response to treatment may entail treating both conditions.
d. Medical treatment for IAC is identical to that described for congenital hydrocephalus (e.g.,
corticosteroids, diuretics,anticonvulsants if indicated).Dogs with IAC tend to respond initially

to medical therapy, but the response is often temporary. Surgical management of IAC in people
istypically either achievedvia cyst fenestration or cystoperitoneal shunt placement (Fig.5.13).
Both procedures have been reported in dogs with IAC. There have been five reported fenestra-
tion cases in which IAC was considered the primary disease. Three were re-imaged afer surgery;
two of the three dogs had evidence of cyst persistence on MR imaging. However, only one of
these two dogs required re-operation. The author has reported successul cystoperitoneal shunting
humans and dogs, and whether fenestration or cystoperitoneal shunting is the preferred proce-
dure remains controversial for both species.
a.
These are uncommon,probably heritable disorders thought to be due to abnormal cerebral
cortical neuronal migration during fetal development. Lissencephaly/pachygyria is characterized
by reduced numbers or absence of gyri on the surface of the cerebral hemispheres and an abnor-
mally thickened, histologically disorganized (loss of the normal laminar arrangement) cerebral
cortex.This disorder ismost commonly encountered in the Lhasa Apso breed but has also been
described in the Wire-Haired Fox Terrier,Irish Setter,and Korat cat.In Irish Setters,cerebellar
hypoplasia and dysplasia occur concurrently. Polymicrogyria is characterized by excessive, small
gyri on the cerebral cortex, This condition was described in a group of four related Standard
Poodlesthatalsodisplayedasymmetricdilationofthelateralventricles.Disorganizationofthe
cerebral cortex was also evident histologically in these Standard Poodles.

b.Clinical signs associated with these neuronal migration disorders are typically evident within the
first several months of life. Animals with lissencephaly/pachygyria may have behavioral abnor-
malities and seizure activity and may be difficult to train. The dogs reported with polymicrogyria
and ventriculomegaly exhibited blindness as the major clinical abnormality. Other clinical signs
included a hypermetric gait in three of four dogs and seizures in one dog.
C.The diagnosis of these disorders is tentatively based upon characteristic clinical signs in a suscep-
tible breed. Diagnosis may be aided by advanced imaging (Fig. 5.14). Although it has not yet
been investigated thoroughly in dogs and cats, MR imaging is used to diagnose children with
these disorders and would be preferable to CT in demonstrating abnormal gyral architecture of
the cerebral cortex. Computed tomography and MR imaging revealed asymmetric ventricular
migration disorders depends upon gross and histopathologic findings of the brain via biopsy or at
necropsy.
for these disorders, animals with lissencephaly/pachygyria may be acceptable pets, if provided the
appropriate home environment. Seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medication (see
Chapter 7). The same may be true for animals with polymicrogyria; however, the only dogs
reported to date with this disorder were euthanized at an early age.
5. Dandy-Walker syndrome76,470,508,.54
Dandy-Walker syndrome is a developmental malformation described in dogs and has been seen
in one cat.The most striking abnormality is thepartial or complete lack of a cerebellarvermis.
Cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle, hydrocephalus, and other malformations of the brain and
spinal cord often accompany the vermal defects. In humans, three separate developmental disorders
involving cerebellar vermal hypoplasia are described: DWS, rhombencephalosynapsis, and Joubert's
syndrome. A more inclusive term, such as cerebellar vermis bypoplasia (CVH), may be more correct to
usein cases that do not entirelyfit the category ofDWS.Thisdisorder leads primarily to cerebellar
dysfunction and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
6.Mis
a.There are a number of rarely reported malformations of the brain, most of which are not com-
patible with life. Exencephaly is protrusion of brain tissue through a calvarial defect without a
meningeal or skin covering. Meningoencephalocele refers to a similar protrusion that maintains
both meningeal and skin coverings. Hydranencephaly describes the absence or near absence of
cerebral cortical tissue and may be difficult to discern from very severe hydrocephalus. Anenceph-
aly is the total or partial absence ofbrain tissue and calvarium.Porencephaly is a condition
142
APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINEAND FELINE NEUROLOGY
characterized by cystic cavities in the cerebrum, which may communicate with thc ventricular
disorder has been described in a Miniature Schnauzer and has been associated with hypodipsic
hypernatremia in this breed. Cyclopian malformation refers to the development of a single,
Inedian-positioned eye. Numerous etiologies have been proposed for these disorders, including
loceles have been described in Burrmese kittens as part of a heritable craniofacial malformation
syndrome. Feline parvovirus (panleukopenia virus) has been implicated as a cause of hydranen-
cephaly and porencephaly in kittens. Agenesis of thc corpus callosum and cyclopian malforma.
rion have been described in kittens exposed to griseofulvin during gestation. Exencephaly may
occur when kittens are cxposed to griseofulvin, merhylmercury, or hydroxyurea during
gestation.
A number of cystic intracranial developmental lesions have been. reported in the vcterinary
literature. The najority of these reports have been of epidlermoid cysts; dermoid cysts, choroid
plexus cysts, and epidural mucocele havc also bcen rcported. Epidermoid cysts and dermoid cysts
have bcen reported primarily in thc cerebellomedullary angle region of dogs of various ages. Most
of these dogs had clinical signs of cercbellovestibular dysfinction, though a few were incidental
necropsy findings. Epidermoid and dermoid cysts are thought to be due to a failure of complete
separation of neuroectoderm from non-neural (epithelial) ectoderm during crmbryogenesis (i.e.,
neural tube closure). Epithelial ectoderm with (dermoid cyst) or without (cpidermoid cyst)
adnexal structures (e.g., hair follicles, sebaceous glands) becomes entrapped within thc CNS and
forms a slowly expanding cystic mass. The lumen of an epidermoid cyst contains a mixture of
cholesterol, keratinocytes, and keratinaceous debris; dermoid cyst lumens contain combinations
of fat, hair, and sweat secretion. Leakage of cyst contents into the surrounding tissue can lead to
ascptic meningitis, termed Mollaret's meningitis in pcoplc.
b. Dogs and cats with these miscellaneous brain malformations are usually either scillborn or die or
are euthanizcd shorly after birth. Epidermoid cysts are usually diagnosed in mature dogs, usually
young adulrs. The rcports of derrmoid cysts in dogs have also becn adults. The CI' and MRI
appearance of epidermoid cysts have been described in dogs, as has the MRI appearance of
T1-weighted MRIs, and hyperintense on T2-weighted MRIs; there is also peripheral or ring-type
enhancement of the cyst wall with contrast administration. Sustained hyperintensity of the cyst
lumen on fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging for epidermoid cysts (due to
lack of free, unbound water protons within the cyst) helps to distinguish then from other cystic-
appearing diseases such as intracranial arachnoid cysts (Fig. 5.15). Dermoid cysts tend to be
hyperinrensc on T1- and 'T2-weighted MRIs, due to the fat content within the cyst lumen. To
date, afl of thc histopathologic descriptions of epidermoid. and dermoid cysts have been necropsy
reports. The same is truc for thc report of a choroid plexus cyst in the dog. The one cat with
intracranial epidural mucoccle recovered fully following surgical removal of the cystic structure.
'T here are no effective treatments for the majority of these disorders, and the prognosis is usually
guarded to poor.
C.Mctabolic
Because the brain has cxtremely high metabolic dcmands, systemic abnormalities that interfere with normal
energy metabolism of the CNS may result in clinical signs of encephalopathy. Since the cerebral cortical
neurons are most susceptible to alrcrcd cncrgy metabolisn, most of these merabolic diseases lead to signs of
forebrain dysfinction. If not corrcctcd, however, brain stem dysfunction and ultimately death of thie patient

following disorders dependsprimarily on treatment of theunderlyingmetabolic disease.Thebasic treatment
strategies for these underlying diseases are discussed, but an in-depth discussion of specific therapies for
these metabolic conditions is beyond the scope of this text.

a.A major function of the liver is to filter out potentially toxic substances received from the
gastrointestinal tract (via the portal venous system) to prevent these substances from gaining
access to the general circulation.When this function is compromised due to hepatic failure or
portosystemic shunting,or both,clinical signs of encephalopathymay result.The pathogenesis of
hepatic encephalopathy is complex. Proposed causative factors include: gut-derived toxins, such
as ammonia, skatoles, indoles, and short-chain fatty acids that reach the systemic circulation and
causeneurotoxicity; alterationin brainneurotransmitterbalance and/orproduction of“false
neurotransmitters" due to increased circulating levels of aromatic amino acids; and circulating
benzodiazepine-like substances that act on brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors.
There are several documented neurotransmitter imbalances associated with hepatic encephalopa-
brain serotonin metabolism haverecentlybeen described inhepatic encephalopathy.These
aberrations involve increased serotonin production from tryptophan (probably related to hyper-
ammonemia), increased serotonin turnover (metabolism by monoamine oxidase system), and
decreased levels of serotonin transport proteins and neuronal binding sites. The overalleffect is
thought to be a reduction of serotonergic neurotransmission.
Most cases of hepatic encephalopathy are due to congenital portosystemic shunts (PSS),
which are aberrant vascular communications between the portal and systemic venous systems
(i.e., bypassing the liver). The majority of these shunts are extrahepatic (located outside the liver
parenchyma) versus intrahepatic (within the liver parenchyma). Extrahepatic shunts typically
144
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINEAND FELINENEUROLOGY
occur in small and toy breeds of dogs (e.g., Yorkshire Terriers, Miniature Schnauzers) and less
commonly in cats, whereas intrahepatic shunts arc more common in larger dog breeds (e.g.
PSS was 12 months, and over onc-third of the cases were over 2 years of age at diagnosis. The
Yorkshire Terrier is the most commonly reported breed with extrahepatic PSs. There are a
number of breeds that arc predisposed to PSS, including Havanese, Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese,
Dandie Dinmont Terrier, Pug, and Miniature Schnauzer. There is probably a hereditary basis to
PSS, and there is evidence to that effect for Yorkshire Terrier, Cairn Terricr, and Irish Wolfhound
breeds. Multiple acquired extrahepatic shunts can form as a result of chronic portal hypertcnsion
in dogs and cats with long-standing hepatic disease.
A congenital disorder termed bepatic microvascular dysplasia (HMD) has been described in
which there are suspected to be multiple microscopic shunting vessels within the liver that bypass
the hepatic sinusoidal system, rather than a grossly visible anomalous vessel. This appears to be
most common in small and toy breeds of dogs (e.g., Cairn 'Terriers may be predisposed) and cats.
Animals with PSS may also have HMD concurrently. Other causes of hepatic encephalopathy
include congenital arteriovenous fistulas and acquired hepatic disorders (e.g., toxin-induced,
infectious, chronic active hepatitis, neoplasia).
b. Clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy include obtunded mental status, abnormal behavior,
compulsive pacing, head-pressing, visual deficits, and seizure activity. Other clinical signs consis-
tent with hepatic failure (e.g., weight loss or failure to gain weight, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhca,
polyuria-polydipsia {PU/PDl) are often present. Cats with PSS are more likely to seizure than
dogs and often exhibit ptyalism as a characteristic clinical sign. Patients with PSS usually develop
clinical signs associated with hepatic insufficiency within the first year of life, bur adult animals
Although seizure activity may be a component of the hepatic encephalopathy displayed by
PSS dogs, it is infrcquent. In one large retrospective study of 168 dogs with single extrahepatic
shunts, only 1 dog had evidence of seizure activity. However, an uncommon (approximately 5%
of cases) yet often fatal postoperative complication of PSS attenuation in dogs is scizurc activity,
which is often severe (i.e., clusters, status cpilepticus). Most of these patients do not have seizure
histories prior to surgery, typically begin seizuring within the first few days postoperatively, and
usually are profoundly encephalopathic. A similar phenomenon has been described in a small
number of cats following PSS surgery. Following shunt ligation in some dlogs, abrupt changes in
C.Diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy is based upon documenting hepatic dysfunction in a paticnt
with neurologic deficits typical of a metabolic encephalopathy. Bloodwork. abnormalitcs (micro-
cytic red blood cells, low blood urea nitrogen [BUN], low albunin, etc.) often point to a liver
problem. Liver enzymes (e.g., alanine aminotransferase-ALT, serum allkaline phosphatase-SAP) are
typically normal to slightly elevated in PSS and HIMD patients, but they are often elevated in
acquired hepatic disorders. Arnmonium biurate crystals may be evident on urinalysis in PSS
patients. Liver function tests, such as serum bile acid and ammonia levels, are often abnormally
clcvatcd.
Although there are multiplc methods (e.g., Imesenteric portography, abdominal ulerasound)
available to demonstratc thc cxistence of PSS, the preferred method is per-rectal scintigraphy. A
radioactive compound called technetium (PmTc) is aclministered rectally, and the patient is placed
under a gamma camera to measure radiation activity as the substance is ahsorbed from the colon.
If the radioactivity is first detected in the heart and lungs, rather than the livcr, this indicates the
presence of PSS (Fig. 5.16). Hyperintense lesions in the basal nuclei (particularly the pallidum
and putamenthe lentiform nuclei) on T 1 -wcighrcd MRls are well-described in humans with
heparic cncephalopathy. The hypcrintensc regions arc believed to be due to manganesc deposi-

tion in these regions of the brain. Similar MRI lesions have been described in dogs and cats with
PSS (Fig. 5.17) in addition to widened sulci.
Animals with HMD may be difficult, if not impossible, to diagnose without performing a
liver biopsy. These patients tend to have normal or slightly abnormal bloodwork results com-
pared with PSS patients (e.g., serum albumin and cholesterol levels, mean corpuscular volume).
Also, serum bile acid concentrations in HMD patients, especially postprandial concentrations,
tend to be lower than in patients with PSs. Per-rectal scintigraphy results are also normal in
animals with HMD. Other hepatic disorders also typically require liver biopsy for a diagnosis.
d. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is directed at reducing the level of gut-derived toxins and
controlling seizures, if present. A diet with a low amount of high-quality protein (e.g., K/D diet)
is usually instituted to minimize ammonia production by gut bacteria. Oral medications such as
lactulose, a synthetic disaccharide, with or without oral antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides), are
administered to decrease colonic bacterial production of volatile fatty acids and other potentially
neurotoxic substances. Lactulose is hydrolyzed by colonic bacteria to produce organic acids (e.g.
lactic, acetic, formic acid) and carbon dioxide. The organic acids lower the pH of the colon,
trapping colonic ammonia in the form of nonabsorbable ammonium. Lactulose may also lead to
a favorable alteration of the colonic fora and accelerated intestinal transit time and may exert
some antiendotoxin activity. Lactulose is administered at an initial dose of 0.5-1.0 ml/kg body
weight every 8 hours. The dose is adjusted, if necessary, to result in two to three soft stools per
day. Neomycin sulfate is poorly absorbed when administered orally but is active against urea-
splitting bacteria in the colon. The dose of neomycin is 20 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours.

Oral ampicillin (22 mg/kg body weight, q 8 hr) and metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg body weight, q
8 hr) are also commonly administered to hepatic encephalopathy patients for their effects on
colonic fora and as protection against sepsis.
In severely encephalopathic paticnts, dilute betadine and/or lactulose enemas have been
recommended. Because of its caustic nature, the author prefers not to use betadine enemas in
these patients.A lactulose enema is prepared using three parts lactulose to seven parts of water.
The enema is administered at a dose of 20 ml/kg and retained in the colon for 15-20 minutes.
This is repeated every 4-6 hours, if necessary. Some patients with hepatic insufficiency may be
hypoglycemic and need supplemental parenteral glucose. It is important to prevent or reverse
conditions that may exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy, such as alkalosis, hypokalemia, and
gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
In cases of postsurgical PSS intractable seizure activity, the author believes that brain swelling
should be assumed and mannitol therapy should be instituted. In addition, although bromide is
a sound anticonvulsant choice in the PSS dog (no hepatic metabolism), it does contribute to the
often obtunded mental state in these patients.The author has had success using intravenous

Anticonvulsant mcdication needs to be tapered to the individual patient and gencrally adminis-
tered at lower than standard dosages if metabolized by the liver.
Treatment of the underlying disorder in hepatic encephalopathy cases is the key to control-
ling signs of neurologic dysfunction. In HMD and most acquired hepatic disorders, medical
management involving dierary modification, lactulose, and other medications (e.g-, prednisone,
anti-cholestatic, and antifibrotic drugs for chronic active hepatitis) form the basis of treatiment.
For PSS, surgical artenuation of the shunting vessel(s) is usually recomimended. Shunt attenua-
tion using a device called an ameroid consirictor is commonly practiced; the ameroid constrictor
allows for progressive attenuation of the shunting vessel following placement. Some PSS patients
will develop refractory generalized seizures after shunt ligarion/attenuation, which can be fatal.
This phenomcnon has been suspected to be due, in part, to an abrupt decrease in brain benzodi-
azepine-like substances following shunt ligation; however, this phenomenon likcly involvcs a
more complicated constellation of neurochcmical aberrations.
Clinical signs of hepatic cncephalopathy can often be reversed with appropriate medical
therapy. The prognosis for each patient depends on the specific underlying disease responsible for
the cncephalopathy. Most extraheparic PSS dogs arc succcssfully treated surgicaily with partial or
complete shunt attenuation. In addition to the am
croid constrictor, cellophane handing and
intravascular thrombogenic coils have also bccn used in artempts to achieve gradual closurc of
portosystemic shunts. Most recently, a percutaneously controlled hydraulic occluder device has
been developed to provide gradual postoperative occlusion of shunt vessels; preliminary data
from this device are encouraging, In general, postoperative complications of PSS surgery are
PSS. The prognosis for cats with extrahepatic PSS and both dogs and cats with intrahepatic PSS
is guarded. HMD patients can be well controlled long tcrm with medical therapy. The prognosis
for dogs and cats with other hepatic disorders is highly variable.
2. Renal-associated encephalopathy9,1*8,162.205,308,618
a.
This category of metabolic cnccphalopathy encompasses uremic encephalopathy (UE), dialysis
dysequilibrium syndrome (DDS), and posttransplantation encephalopathy (PTE). Similar to
hepatic encephalopathy, there are numerous proposed mechanisms to explain uremic encepha
lopathy, which include the folowing: circulating neurotoxins, such as high levels of parathyroid
hormone (PTH), which may lhiave a direct toxic effect on rieurons in addition to secondary
effects ffom increased extracellular calcium levels; ionic imbalances, particularly hypercalcemia,
which can lead to neuronal mineralization; hyperosmolality, causing cerebral neuronal dehydra-
tion; hypertension, which may lead to tortuosity, intimal proliferation, and necrosis of cerebral
vasculature; urcmic vasculitis affecting cerebral blood vessels; acid-basc imbalancc, specifically
acidosis depressing cerebral function; and uremia-induced neurotransmitrer imbalance in the
brain. Low-grade anemia in some renal failure patients fmay contribute to these aforementioned
processes in producing encephalopathy
Dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome is thought to be caused by an osmotic gradient between
thc hrain and the extracellular fluid environiment due to ovcrly rapid hcmodialysis. The brain
remains relatively hyperosmotic to the blood, perhaps due to production of intrancuronal
idiogenic osmoles during the uremic state. Thc gradient causes the neurons to imbibe water,
leading to cerebral cderma.
In PTE, described in cats after renal transplantarion, uncontrolled hypertension is thought to
play a major causative role.
D.
Clinical signs of renal-associated encephalopathy are similar, whether due to UE, DDS, or PTE,
although chey tend to be most severe with the latter disorder. Abnormal mentation, ranging from
obtundation (with or without signs of dementia) to coma, and seizure activity are typical abnor-
malities. Other clinical signs may include muscle tremors, generalized weakness, and irregular

respiration. Thc abnormal respiratory activity is thought to be due to decreased brain stem
receptivity to chemoreceptor stimulation. Other clinical sigus (dehydration,nausea/vomiting.
PU/PD, etc.) are reflective of renal failure.
C.
Diagnosis of renal-associated encephalopathy is based upon typical clinical signs of neurologic
dysfunction in a patient with renal failure, with no other obvious cause of brain disease. Devel-
opment of encephalopathic signs soon after hemodialysis or renal transplantation provides
compelling evidence for DDS and PTE, respectivcly.
d. Treatment of renal-associated encephalopathy depends primarily upon managcment of the
underlying kidney discasc. Electrolyte and acid-base imbalances should be corrected, if indicated,
and seizures should be controlled with anticonvulsant drugs. Managing arterial hypertension in
cats before and after renal transplantation with propranolol, hydralazine, and/or acepromazine
may help prevent the development of PTE.
The prognosis of renal-associated encephalopathy is variable and dcpends mainly on the
specific renal abnormality. In most cases, the encephalopathy can be ameliorated or resolved with
control of uremia. The development of P'TE is best avoided, as these cats tend ro have severe
signs of neurologic dysfunction and a high mortality rate.
3.Hygymic nchaloah232345
The brain has an absolute requirement for glucosc. Glucose enters the brain via a noninsulin-
a，
dependent facilitated transport mechanism. This transport mechanism requires a minimum
blood glucosc lcvel to opcrate effctively. There are limited glycogen stores in the brain, and the
neuronal energy depletion associated with severe (usually less than 45 mg/dl) hypoglycemia often
results in clinical signs of encephalopathy.
There are multiple causes of hypoglycemia, inclurding overproduction of endogenous insulin
or insulin-like substances (e.g., insulin-like growth factors) by pancreatic insulinomas or other
neoplasms, glycogen depletion in neonatal/juvenile puppies (usually of toy and miniature breeds)
and kittens, sepsis, and exogenous insulin overdose (i.e., diabetes mellitus patients, especially
feline). Other less-common causes of clinically significant hypoglycemia include hypoadrenocorti-
cism, liver failure, glycogen storage diseases, and the so-called hunting dog hypoglycenmia syn-
drome, the later of which may represent the combined effects of strenuous exercise with
inadequate caloric intake.
b. The nature and severity of clinical signs produced by severe bypoglycemia depend upon the rate
of decline of blood glucose, the absolute degree of hypoglycemia, and the duration of hypoglyce-
mia. Rapid decreases of blood glucose rcsult in a systemic adrenergic responsc, with typical
clinical signs such as pupillary dilation, tremors, irritability, vocalization, and cxtrcne hungcr
Slower decreascs in blood glucose levels, as is common with insulinomas, typically result in signs
of encephalopathy, such as behavior changes, altered mental status (typically obtundation, but
coma can result if hypoglycemia is untreated), seizure activity, and visual dysfiunction. General.
ized weakness is also a common characteristic feature of dogs and cats with progressive
hypoglycemia.
 The diagnosis of hypoglycemic encephalopathy is based on documenting hypoglycemia in an
encephalopathic patient whose clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction improvc or resolve with
normalization of blood glucose levels. Specific diagnostic tests (e.g. insulin/glucose rario for
insulinoma, identifying circulating insulin-like growth factor II for other neoplasms) for the
various causes of hypoglycemia are not covered in this text (consult the appropriate references
listed in the notes at the end of this chapter).
P
Symptomatic therapy for hypoglycemic cnccphalopathy involves intravenous administration of
0.5-1 ml/kg of 50% dextrose, diluted 1:2 with sterile water. This may need to be repeated and/
or the patient may rcquire a continuous infusion of 5% dextrose. Concentrated dextrose solu-
tions should be given through large-bore veins such as the jugulat, especially if repeated adminis-
trations are performed. Specific therapies for individual causes of hypoglycemia are covered in the

references at the end of this chaptcr. The prognosis for short-term correction of hypoglycemic
cncephalopathy is usualy cxcllent. The long-term prognosis varies with the underlying disease
process but is generally guarded to good. Pancreatic insulinoma, probably the most common
causc of hypoglycemic encephalopathy in dogs, is associated with mean and/or median survival
times of 12-18 months with a combination of surgical/medical management. In a recent report
of 28 dogs with pancreatic insulinoma, survival times appeared to be substantially higher than
previously describcd, especially for dogs trcarcd surgicaly. The median survival time for the 19
a.  Imbalances of sodium (Nat) and calcium (Ca) may cause clinical signs of encephalopathy, the
severity of which tends to correlate directly with the rapidity of development of the particular
inbalance. There are numerous potential causes for these electrolyte disturbances. Hypernatremia
and hyponatremia are, for all practical purposes, synonymous with hyperosmolality and hypoos-
molality, respectively. Hypernatremia caa lead to shrinkage of brain parenchymal cels. A poten-
tial secondary effect of this parenchymal shrinkage is stretching and tearing of small intracranial
blood vessels with resultant hemorrhage. Both intracellular dehydration and intracranial hemor
rhage may contribute to brain dysfunction in the hypernarremic state. With chronic hypernatre-
mia (more than two or three days), brain parenchymal cells will produce osmotically active
intracellular substances called idiogenic osmoles in an attempt to compensate for the increased
extracelular osmolality. Hyponatremia can result in swelling of brain parenchymal clls with
subsequent brain ederma. Brain parenchymal cells will compensate for chronic hyponarremia
(more than 2 or 3 days) by actively extruding osmorically active intracellular components, such
as potassium and amino acids. Overly rapid corrcction of either a chronic hypernatremic or
alopathy is duc to brain edema (associated with the idiogenic osmoles), whereas in the second, it
is likely due to axonal shrinkage (due to relative lack of intracellular osmolality) and subsequent
dermyelination in the brain stem (particularly the thalamus), similar to central pontine myelinoly
sis in people.
Hypercalcemia can cause decreased excitability of ncuronal cell membranes, as well as direct
toxic damage to neuronal intracellular energy-producing systems. Hypocalcemia may lead to
increased cxcitability of neuronal cell membrancs, as well as abnormal neurotransmission.
b. Clinical signs of elcctrolyte-associated encephalopathy (EAE) typically indicate forebrain dysfunc-
tion but can progress to involving the brain stem. Dementia, behavior changes, altered mental
status (obtundation that may progress to coma), seizures, and visual deficits are likely clinical
signs of EAE. Patients with hypocalcemia may also exhibit muscular tetany.
C
 Diagnosis of EAE is based upon demonstrating an abnormal electrolyte status ini an encephalo-
pathic patient that improves or normalizes upon correction of the abnornal electrolyte level. In
overly rapid correction of hyponatremic states, bilaterally symmetric thalamic lesions may be
evident on MR imaging (Fig. 5.18).
d.Treatment of EAE involves correction of the electrolyte disturbance, as well as invcstigation and
potential treatment of the underlying cause for the elecrolyre abnormality. Correction of hyper-
natremia is achieved by administering fuids that are hypoosmolar to the patient. This can be
achieved via using 5% dextrosc (basically free water), half-strength or normal saline, depending
upon the degree and chronicity of the hypernatremia. The amount of water to administer can be
calculated according to the following formula:
Water deficit (L) = 0.6 x lean body wcight (kg) × patient's Na*/normal Na* -1
With relatively acurc hypcrnatremia, the deficit can be corrected quickly using 5% dextrose.
With chronic hypernatremia, the deficit should be corrected gradually over 48-72 hours, starting

with half-strength or normal saline, eventually switching to 5% dextrose. The chronically hyper-
natremic patient's sodiumlevel should not be lowered faster than 0.5 mEq/l/hr.Hyponatremia is
corrected by administering sodium-containing fuids such as normal or hypertonic saline (in
acute, severe cases). The amount of sodium to be replenished can be calculated as follows:
Sodium deficit (mEq/l)=0.6× lean body weight (kg)×(normal Na+-patient’s Na+)
As with chronic hypernatremia, chronic hyponatremia should be corrected slowly over 48-72
hours, raising the patient's sodium level by no more than 0.5 mEq/l/hr.
Hypocalcemia is corrected in the emergency situation by slow intravenous infusion of 10%
calcium gluconate at a dosage of 5-15 mg/kg over 10-30 minutes; this should work out to be
0.5-1.5 ml/kg. It is extremely important not to confuse the two ways of expressing dosage of this
drug,as overdosage can befatal.While administeringcalciumgluconate,thepatient'selectrocar-
diogram (ECG) should be continuously recorded. The infusion should be stopped if premature
ventricular contractions,shortening of the QT interval,or bradycardia are observed.Once the
patient is stabilized, maintenance oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation can be initiated.
Emergency therapy of the hypercalcemic patient usually involves diuresis with 0.9% saline (two
to three times maintenance fuid rate) and furosemide (2-4 mg/kg intravenously, q 8-12 hr, or a
5mg/kg IV bolus,followed by5mg/kg/hr continuous infusion).Other therapies may include
glucocorticoids and calcitonin administration.The prognosis for reversing encephalopathic signs
due to electrolyte disturbances is generally favorable. The overall prognosis for the individual
patient is highly variable and depends upon the specific disease process responsible for the
electrolyteaberration.
a. In addition to pancreatic insulinoma and disorders of the parathyroid glands, there are several
endocrine disorders that can lead to brain dysfunction. Hyperthyroidism (in cats, rarely dogs),
hypothyroidism (in dogs, rarely cats), diabetes mellitus, and hyperadrenocorticism may each
signs by altering brain neurotransmitter balance; thyroid hormones may also directly increase
membrane excitability of brain parenchymal cells. Systemic hypertension is a common feature of
hyperthyroidism and may also contribute to encephalopathic signs. Low thyroid hormone levels
in hypothyroidism may cause encephalopathy by a number of proposed mechanisms, including
diminished neuronal oxygen consumption, accumulation of water-retaining extracellular muco-

polysaccharide subsrances in the hrain (myxedema), and vascular compromise to the brain due to
atherosclerosis of major blood vessels. Both ketoacidotic and nonketotic hyperosmolar diabetes
mellitus miay lead to cncephalopathic signs. The pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy is
thought to be due primarily to hyperosmolarity in both forms of the disease. Excessive circulat-
ing glucocorticoid levels in hyperadrenocorticism may lead to brain neurotransmitter imbalance;
vascular compromise of the brain.
b. Dogs and cats with endocrine-relared encephalopathy typically exhibit signs of forebrain dysfunc-
tion in addition lo other clinical signs relating to the underlying endocrine disorder (e.g., PU/
PD, polyphagia, etc.). An obtunded mental status is commonly appreciated with hypothyroidism
and diabetes mellitus. Central vestibular dysfunction has recently been associated with hypothy
roidism in dogs also; in that study, three of eight dogs imaged (five with CT, three with MR
imaging) had cvidence of brain infarction. Since ischemic lesions (especially in the caudal fossa)
are difficult to detect on CT imaging, ir was suggested that the role of vascular infarction may
have been underestimatcd in thesc dogs. Hyperthyroid cats are more likely to appear restless and
irritable, and may exhibit aggressive behavior. Hyperadrenocorticoid-related encephaloparhy can
manifest either as obtundation or hyperexcitability. Other clinical signs of cncephalopathy such
as aimless pacing, focal and generalized seizure activity (rare with these endocrinopathies), and
vocalization, may be appreciated in patients with these endocrine disorders. A rare, yet life.
threatening, form of hypothyroid encephalopathy, called myxedema stupor or coma, produces
severe alterations of consciousncss, as the name implies. Doberman Pinschers appear to be
predisposed to this syndrome.
Diagnosis of an endocrine-relared encephalopathy is made by documenting clinical signs of brain
dysfunction in a patient with an endocrinopathy that improves or resolves with control of the
endocrine disorder. The references at the end of this chapter should be consulted for specifics
pertaining to diagnosis of endocrine disorders.
d.Treatment of endocrine-related encephalopathics involves successfully controlling the underlying
endocrine disturbance. The specifics of treating each of the above-mentioned endocrinopathies is
beyond the scopc of this rexthook. In gcncral, severe ketoacidotic and nonketotic hyperosmolar
diabetes mellitus are trcated with fuid/clectrolyre replacement and intravenous or intramuscular
insulin administration. Hyperthyroidism is treated either by surgical removal of the hyperfunc-
tional thyroid gland(s) or via radioactive iodine therapy. Hypothyroidism is typicaily treated by
oral administration of thyroid replacement hormone at a dosage of 20 μg/kg q. 12 hr. Hypothy-
roid myxedema stupor/coma is treated via intravenous administration of thyroid replacement
hormone (0.066-0.11 mg/kg) and intensive supportive care, followed by maintenance oral
thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Other less severe forms of hypothyroid-associated enceph-
alopathy afe treated with oral thyroid replacement therapy. Hyperadrenocorticism is usually
treated with oral lysodren, the amount titrated based on results of adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) stimulation tests. T'he prognosis for cndocrine-associated encephalopathies is quite
variable and depends on the underlying endocrine disorder. Except for the rare hypothyroid
imyxedema stupor/coma syndrome, the prognosis for both reversal of encephalopathic signs and
control of the endocrine diseasc is typically good.
6. Encephalopathy associated with acid-base disturbances28,22,123
a.Acid-base disturbances are uncomrnon causes of enccphalopathy. There arc multiplc causcs for
the various acid-base disturbances, and the suggcsted references pertaining ro this subject should
be consulred. Of the four main types of acid-base disturbance (respiratory acidosis, metabolic
acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and metabolic alkalosis), respiratory acidosis is themost likely to
cause signs of encephalopathy. Alkalosis is very unlikely to result in encephalopathic signs and
will not be discussed. Rcspiratory acidosis is usually due to poor ventilatory ability, but it can
also occur with severe pulmonary disease. Carbon dioxide diffuses readily across the blood-brain
152
barrier (BBB) and can affect brain function in several ways. Carbon dioxide can affect the brain
both directly and through decreasing brain pH levels. Carbon dioxide narcosis may occur both
through alterations in brain neurotransimitter balance and increases in brain blood volume
(leading to increased intracranial pressure). The hypoxia that typically accompanies hypercapnia
may exacerbate the effects of hypercapnia on the brain. Merabolic acidosis may also lead to mild
encephalopathic signs, but this is less likely due to the patient's ability to compensate through
hyperventilation.
b. Encephalopathy from respiratory acidosis typically results in alteration of level (obtundation to
coma)and/or content(dementia/delirium)of consciousness. Such patients will also display
obvious respiratory difficulty.When encephalopathic signs result from metabolic acidosis, they
tend to be much less severe than those experienced with respiratory acidosis. These patients may
be hyperventilating as a compensatory response, but they are not usually in respiratory distress.
C.
Diagnosis of acidosis as a cause of encephalopathy is based upon reversal of clinical signs of brain
dysfunction concomitant with correction of the acid-base disturbance. The nature of the acid-
base disturbance is elucidated from arterial blood-gas analysis, as well as measurements of pH
and bicarbonate levels. The underlying cause for the acid-base disturbance should be investigated.
d.The reader should refer to the references at the end of this chapter for specific treatment of
individual patient's nceds. Overzealous administration of intravenous bicarbonate to a patient
with encephalopathy due to acidosis may cause a transient worsening of brain dysfunction. The
carbon dioxide produced afrer administering bicarbonate to an acidotic patient will rapidly cross
the BBB, whereas the bicarbonate itself will not. This may lead to the so-called paradoxic CNS
acidosis. If this phenomenon does occur, it is rarely of much clinical consequence. The prognosis
for reversing encephalopathic signs due to acidosis is usually favorable in the short term. The

a.Abnormal mitochondrial respiratory enzyme function, due to a number of potentially heritable
defects, is believed to be the pathophysiologic basis for a number of recently described encepha-
have been reported in several breeds, most notably Alaskan Huskies, Australian Cattle Dogs and
Shetland Sheepdogs. It has been determined that the spongiform leukoencephalopathy of both
the Australian Cattle Dog and Shetland Sheepdog is due to a maternally inherited missense
mutation of mitochondrial DNA.This disorder is now thought to be more siinilar to the human
mitochondrial disorder called Kearns-Sayre syndrome than to Canavan's disease, as prcviously
described.A similar disorder has been reported in an Fnglish Springer Spaniel and was suspected
(based on pathologic findings) in a Yorkshire Terrier and several kittens. Clinical and pathological
features of six Yorkshire Terriers with a suspected mitochondrial encephalopathy (ME) were also
recently described. A 10-month-old female Jack Russell Terrier was reported with a progressive
history of cerebellar dysfunction, blindness, and deafness beginning at 10 weeks of age. At
necropsy, lesions similar to human ME with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)
syndrome were identified. In addition to severe,bilaterally symmetrical regions of neuronal
degeneration in several areas of the brain, mineral deposits were found within the brain paren-
chyma and associated with vascular myocytes. Finally, some of the previously described idio-
pathic vacuolar or spongiform encephalopathies are currently suspected to be MEs or organic
acidurias (see next section). Clinical and pathologic findings in many of these animals (especially
Alaskan Husky,Springer Spanicl, and Yorkshire Terrier breeds) are similar to a human disorder
called Leighs syndrome, or subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (SNE). Leigh's syndrome repre-
sents a group of heritable neurodegenerative diseases, the majority of which are due to defects in
themitochondrialrespiratory enzyme chain.

b.The majority of reported dogs initially developed clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction in the
first year of life (most between 6 and 12 months). However, there appears to be a wide age range
for the onset of clinical signs. T'he six reported Yorkshire Terriers developed clinical signs of
neurologic dysfunction between 4 months and 1 year of age. One Alaskan husky was 2.5 years of
age at onset, and another was 6 years old. The English Springer Spaniel was approximately 15
months old at the time of onset of signs. Seizures and/or generalized ataxia of acute onset are
typically the initial clinical signs. Clinical features supportive of a diffuse, symmetric cncepha-
lopathy (Alaskan Husky) or encephalomyelopathy (Australian Cattle Dog, English Springer
Spaniel) develop within weeks to months. Other signs of neurologic dysfunction in Alaskan
Huskies with ME include behavioral abnormalities (e.g., anxiety, obtundation, propulsive
exploratory behavior), diffculty prehending food,visual defcits,facial hypalgesia,head tremor,
hypermetric gait with loss of balance, delayed proprioceptive placing, and varying degrees of
tetraparesis. Clinical signs in both Australian Cattle Dogs and Shetland Sheepdog puppies were
indicative of multifocal CNS disease and were progressive in nature. In the Australian Cattle
Dogs, signs of progressive cerebellar dysfunction predominated, starting as a whole body tremor
at about 3-4 weeks of age. Other signs in severely affected pups included jaw drop, hypersaliva-
Australian Cattle Dogs include progressive spastic tetraparesis with weakness and extensor rigidity
of thoracic limbs (sometimes culminating in tetanic contraction), head tilt, and nystagmus.
Progressive seizure activity was described in the Shctland Shcecpdog pups, in addition to signs of
cerebellar dysfunction. Clinical signs in these dogs developed between 1 and 3weeks of age.The
English Springer Spaniel exhibited loss of menace response with some visual deficit, positional
vertical nystagmus, and cxcitement-induced hypermetria and balance loss. The disease tends to
be episodic in Alaskan Huskies, and slowly progressive in Australian Cattle Dogs. Clinical signs
in theYorkshireTerriers included cerebellar dysfunction,blindness, sizure,deafnesand
pharyngeal and laryngeal dysfunction.
Leigh's syndrome; increased CSF levels of lactate and pyruvate were documented in the Austra-
lian Cattle Dog puppies. With the exception of one Australian Carttle Dog with a mild pleocyto-
sis and elevated protein concentration, CSF evaluation has been normal in affected dogs.
Advanced imaging (CT, MR) has been performed on a limited number of dogs. Bilaterally
symmetric, cavirary lesions in the brain and/or spinal cord were evident upon imaging, which
corresponded to lesions discovered at necropsy. Bilateral cavitary lesions were evident on CT
imaging in the thalamus and medulla of the Yorkshire Terriers; electron microscopy of these
lesionsrevealedabnormally shapedneuronalmitochondria.Similar toLeigh'ssyndrome of
humans, MRI lesions associated with ME in dogs are characteristically hypointense on T1-
weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and non-contrast enhancing
(Fig.5.19).
Definitive diagnosis of these disorders is based on gross and histopathologic features of the
CNS at necropsy. Bilaterally symmetric, spongiform/vacuolar lesions, primarily affecting gray
matter, are the pathologic halmark of these disorders. Histopathologically, multiple areas of the
CNS are affected in ME dogs, but some regions are grossly abnormal on gross inspection.
Spongiform brain stem lesions from thalamus to medulla are prominent in Alaskan Huskies, the
thalamic lesions being most conspicuous.Australian Cattle Dogs tend to have cavitary lesions in
cerebellar and brain stem nuclei, as well as in both the cervical and lumbosacral intumescences.
The English Springer Spaniel had similar lesions in the accessory olivary nuclei of the brain stem.
Abnormal mitochondria in neurons and astrocytes have bcen demonstrated ultrastructurally in
several cases of ME.
d.To date, all cases of ME have been euthanized due to either progression or recurrence of neuro-
logic dysfunction. Most have been euthanized two to seven months from the onset of neurologic

dysfunction. In people, therapies for mitochondrial encephalopathies are usually ineffective.
There has been some small degree of success with dietary management and supplementation
(e.g., B vitamins, vitamin E, coenzyme Q, succinate). Such therapy has not yet been described in
veterinaryMEcases.
a.
The organic acidurias represent a number of diseases in which there is a defect (typically a
deficiency in one or more enzymes) in cellular metabolism, leading to the accumulation of one
155
or more organic acids; these organic acids accumulate and are often detectable in the serum,
CSF; and/or urine. Most of thesc disorders are due to inherited (usually autosomal recessive)
deficiencies of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, although some involve cytosolic
enzymes. In many ways, organic acidurias overlap with the previously described nitochondrial
encephalopathies, differing primarily in the presence of identifiable accumulared organic acids in
the urine and other body fuids. Since organic acid screening of the urine was not performed for
many of the previously reported cases of ME, it is possible that soime of these dogs had organic
acidurias. As mentioned with the MEs, some of the previously reported idiopathic spongiform/
vacuolar encephalopathies may eventually be demonstrated to be organic acidurias. T'he deff-
ciency for a specifc organic aciduria may be due to lack of an essential enzyme or lack of
function of an enzyme due to a cofactor insuffciency (c.g., cobalamin-vitamin Byx is required for
normal functioning of methylmalonyl CoA decarboxylase). Occasionally, an organic aciduria is.
an acquired disorder, due to either a malabsorptive problem (e.g., exocrine pancreatic insuff-
ciency) or a toxin (e.g, propylene glycol toxicity). Clinical signs of encephalopathy are due to
abnormal cellular energy metabolism, toxic efects of the accumulated organic acid(s), or a
combination of these rwo processes In addition to these factors, altered oxidative cellular energy
mcrabolism may leadl to a shif toward anaerobic encrgy pathways. This may lead to other
metabolic dcrangements such as ketoacidosis, hyperammonemia, hypoglyccmia, and lactic
acidosis, which may contribute to the cncephalopathic state. The amino acid carnitine serves two
across the inner mitochondrial membrane for oxidation and cellular energy production. Carni-
tine also serves as a buffer for accumulated organic acids. Since the accumulation of organic acids
interferes with mitochondrial function, carnitine will bind with the fatty acids, and these conju-
gates are excreted in the urine. With organic acidurias, it is cominon for a secondary carnitine
deficiency to develop due to loss of carnitine in the urinc.
A number of organic acidurias have been reporred in people, including maple syrup urinc
disease (defciency of oxo- or keto-acid dehydrogenase), methylmalonic aciduria (deficient
methylmalonyl CoA mutase activity), malonic aciduria (malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency),
propionic aciduria (propionyl CoA carboxylase deficiency), glutaric aciduria (glutaryl CoA
dehydrogenase deficiency or elecrron transport favoprotein dysfunction), and L-2-hydroxyglutaric
aciduria (specific defect unknown, thought to involve lysine metabolism). Although classified as a
leukodystrophy, Canavan's disease is an encephalopathy due to deficiency of aspartoacylase
activity, which leads to the accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid.
Organic acidurias have been reported in a number of dogs. These include L-2-hydroxyglu-
taric aciduria in Staffordshire Bull Terriers and a West Highland Whire Terrier, malonic aciduria
in Maltcse dogs, a suspected primary organic aciduria in Standard Poodle dogs, a suspccted acyl-
CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and a Labrador Retriever dog
wih combined methylmalonic and malonic aciduria. A Labrador Retriever with clinical signs.
MR imaging findings, and histopathologic lesions sinilar to human Canavan's disease was
described; it has been theorized that previously reported cases of leukodystrophy/spongy degen-
eration in Labradlors may represenr a canine form of Canavan's disease. The same was suspected
for a prcviously reported leukodystrophy in Shetland Sheepdogs. More rcccntly, howevcr, it has
been suggcstcd that the Shetland Sheepdog disorder is more analogous to the human mitochon-
drial disorder called Kearns-Sayre synzdrome than to Canavan's disease (see MEs). A cat with a
suspected acquired organic aciduria has also been described. This cat developed D-lactic acidosis,
presumably due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and subsequent intestinal bacterial over-
growth. Bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates was thought to be the source of the
D-lactic acid. Another cat was diagnosed with organic aciduria, which was associated with
cobalamin (vitamin B deficiency). This cat was suspected to have sorme inborn error of cobala-
min absorption, leading to accumulation of inethylmalonic acid and its precursors.

b.Reported clinical signs of neurological dysfunction with the organic acidurias are variable in their
severity and progression,even within a specific disorder. In general, these diseases tend to cause
signs of multifocal or diffuse CNS dysfunction and may be episodic in nature. The L-2-hydroxy-
glutaric aciduria described in Staffordshire Bull Terriers and one West Highland White Terrier
was slowly progressive. In the former breed, six dogs presented between the ages of 4 months and
7years with clinical complaints of seizurcs, ataxia, dementia,and head/neck tremors.The West
Highland White Terrier had visual impairment, dementia, episodic head tremors (stres-related),
King Charles Spaniel with suspected acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency displayed episodic ataxia
with thoracic limb hypermetria,as well as altered mentation and seizure activity.The propositus
case for the Maltese dogs with malonic aciduria exhibited seizure activity starting at 6months,
and later exhibited progressive alteration of consciousness. Twenty-five Standard Poodle puppies
with an unclassifed organic aciduria had severe and progressive clinical signs that included
generalized weakness, ataxia, obtunded mentation, neck muscle weakness with head ventroflex-
ion, generalized tonic/clonic seizures, and tremors. Thosc puppies that survived longer than 4-5
weeks progressed to lateral recumbency and opisthotonus. The 3-month-old Labrador Retriever
with combined rmethylmalonic/malonic aciduria exhibited signs of diffuse forebrain, brain stem,
and spinal cord dysfunction that progressed over a 5-month period. This dog also had severe
hydrocephalus and syringomyelia. The 7-month-old Labrador Retriever with lesions similar to
human Canavan's disease exhibited progressve tetraparesis and cerebellar dysfunction. The 2-
year-old cat with suspected acquired D-lactic acidosis displayed episodic weakness, ataxia, leth
argy, and obtunded mentation over a 4-month period. The 4-year-old cat with suspected
cobalamin malabsorption had displayed multiple episodes of forebrain dysfunction (e.g.,
obtunded mentation, blindness) and balance loss, supportive of multifocal/diffuse brain disease.
c.Diagnosis of organic acidurias is accomplished by demonstrating abnormally high levels of
There are several reports of MRI lesions in patients with organic acidurias. Similar to the mito
chondrial cncephalopathies, these tend to be bilaterally symmetric lesions of white or gray matter
structures (depending on the disorder) that are hyperintense on T2-weighted images (Fig. 5.20).
These lesions tend to be slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images and are not contrast
enhancing. Cerebrospinal fuid cytology and protein concentrations are normal.
d.Treatment of organic acidurias is based primarily on manipulating dict and adding vitamin
supplementation to compensate for abnormal metabolic pathways. In addition, anticonvulsant
therapy is necessary when seizure activity is part of thc clinical picture.Although specific dietary
manipulation should be tailored to specific needs of a patient, general recommendations typically
include a high-carbohydrate, low-fat (with the majority of fats being medium-chain triglycerides),
low-protein diet, and supplementation with L-carnitine (50 mg/kg BID) and several B-vitamins
(e.g, cobalamin, thiamine, riboflavin).
The prognosis for organic acidurias is variable but is guarded overall. The dogs with L-2-
hydroxyglutaric aciduria appear to have a slowly progressive disorder that may respond to dietary
aciduria resolved with institution of a low-fat diet high in medium-chain triglycerides. Neuro-
logic dysfunction also resolved in the cat with D-lactic acidosis following pancreatic enzyme
replacement therapy. The prognosis for the remaining disorders, especially the neonatal Standard
Poodle encephalopathy, appears to be poor.

a.Primary brain tumors are commonly encountered in dogs and cats.Primary brain tumors include
those neoplasms that originate from brain parenchymal tissue (glial cells and neurons), cells that
make up the outer and inner lining of the brain (meninges and ependyma, respectively), as well
as vascular elements (e.g., choroid plexus). In both spccies, meningioma is the most commonly
reported tumor. Multiple histologic subtypes of meningiomas are encountered in dogs, whereas
the spectrum of histologic subtypes of feline meningiomas is somewhat limited. Gliomas (e.g.
astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) are frequently reported in dogs and occasionally reported in
cats. Other primary brain tumors less commonly reported in dogs include choroid plexus
tumors, primary CNS lymphosarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET; which
typically includes neuroblastoma), primary CNS histiocytic sarcoma (also termed malignant
histiocytosis),ependymoma,and vascularhamartoma. Other primary brain tumors occasionally
encountered in cats include, in addition to gliomas, ependymomas, olfactory neuroblastomas,
and choroid plexus tumors. In both dogs and cats, thcre are case reports of medulloblastomas,
usually involving the cerebellum. Microglial tumors arc also considered rare in dogs and cats.
Meningioangiomatosis is a rare proliferative disorder, primarily of young dogs, involving the
leptomeninges with inyasion along parenchymal perivascular spaces. This enigmatic disorder
tends to affect the brain stem and/or cranial cervical spinal cord. Although technically not a
neoplasm, it is included here because it behaves as such. Similar to primary brain tumors in
people, the causes of these neoplasms are uncertain.Brain tumors exert their pathologic effects
both by directly encroaching upon and/or invading brain tissue and by secondary effects such as
peritumoral edema, infarnmation, obstructive hydrocephalus, and hemorrhage.
b.1
Primary brain tumors can occur in any breed of dog or cat of either sex. Dogs and cats with
brain tumors are typically middle-aged to older (over 5 years), with the majority being older than
9 years of age. The median age for dogs to develop brain tumors is 9 years, and for cats it is over
10 years. There appears to be a predilection for male cats to develop meningiomas, with no
obvious breed predilection for this species. Dolichocephalic dog breeds (e.g., German Shepherd
dogs, Collies) are more likely to develop meningiomas, whereas brachycephalic breeds (e.g..
Boxers,BostonTerriers) seem more prone to gliomas. Golden Retrievers and Boxer dogs appear
to be particularly predisposed to developing primary brain tumors. Golden Retrievers are prone
to developing meningiomas, whereas Boxer dogs and other brachycephalic breeds are more likely
to be diagnosed with gliomas. In both dogs and cats, patients with meningiomas tend to be
somewhat older at diagnosis than those with other brain tumor types. In dogs, astrocytomas are
more likely to occur in the diencephalon and cerebellum than are other primary brain tumors.
Choroid plexus tumors may occurinthe lateral,third,or fourth ventricles.Clinicopathologic
features of choroid plexus tumors in dogs have recently been reviewed. Choroid plexus tumors
comprise choroid plexus papillomas (CPP) and choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC). Choroid
plexus tumors in general tended to occur in the fourth ventricle in this report, and only CPCs
occurred in the lateral ventricles. The two tumor subtypes were differentiated based upon the
presence or absence of local or distant metastases, as well as on histopathologicfeatures.In one
large study, it was found that half of canine primary brain tumors occupy more than one ana-
tomic region of the brain; this could lead to the false conclusion based upon neurologic examina
tion that a patient with a solitary brain mass has multifocal disease.Also in thar study it was
found that 23% of dogs with primary brain tumors had concurrent, unrelated neoplasia (e.g,
pulmonary carcinoma, hemangiosarcoma), most of which involved the thoracic or abdominal
cavity. This finding underscores the importance of screening for concurrent unrelated neoplasia
(via thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasonography) prior to pursuing advanced diagnos-
tics and definitive therapy for the brain tumor. In cats with primary brain tumors, nonspecific
presenting clinical signs (i.e., signs not bviously referable to neurologic dysfunction) are fairly
common, occurring in over 20% of cats in one large case study. These clinical signs included
5 / ENCEPHALOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE BRAIN
159
lethargy, inappetence, and anorexia. Also in that study, it was found that approximately
19%of feline brain tumors were considered an incidental finding. Multiple intracranial menin-
giomas have been rcported to occur in cats with some frequency (approximately 17%). In one
study, 10% of cats were found to have two different types of intracranial neoplasia
concurrently.
Historical and presenting clinical signs are variable and refect both the location and the
presenting clinical sign of neurologic dysfunction in dogs with brain tumors, occurring in
approximately half of the cases. In one study of feline brain tumors, thc overall incidence of
seizure activity was 23%, occurring more commonly with glioma (26.7%) and lymphoma
(26.3%), ini comparison with meningioma (15%). Cats with brain tumors most commonly
present to the veterinarian with a complaint of behavior change. Cats will occasionally have
multiple meningiomas, so the clinical signs of dysfuncrion mmay reflect more than one intracranial
mass lesion. Cerebral tumors are more common than tumors of the brain stem or cerebellum.
Cerebral and diencephalic tumors tend to cause clinical signs of dysfunction such as seizurc
activity, behavior changes, circling, head-pressing, visual deficits, and hemi-inatrention syndrome.
Proprioceptive placing deficits and neck pain are oftcn appreciable upon neurologic examination.
Tumors of the brain stem from rnidbrain through medulla often cause alterations of conscious-
ncss, dysfunction of cranial nerves (other than CN I and CN I), and obvious gait/proprioceptive
abnormalities. Cerehellar tumors may result in clinical signs of dysfunction such as ataxia,
dysmetria, intention trcmors, vestibular abnormalities,and menace reaction deficits with normal
vision.
In most cases, clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction occur slowly and insidiously over time,
especially with meningiomas. Owners of pets with meningiomas will often retrospectively realize
that their pet had a behavior change for months to over a year prior to diagnosis. The subtle
behavior changes are often attributed to old age. However, brain tumor patients can have
subacute to acute developmenr of neurologic dysfunction. These patients may experience sudden
cxhaustion of hrain compensatory mechanisms or may suffer hemorrhage or acute obstructive
hydroccphalus duc to the tumor.
The diagnosis of brain tumor should be highly suspected in an elderly dog or cat with slowly
C.
progressive signs of brain dysfunction. A brain tumor should also be suspected in aninals that
experience a recent onset of seizure activity after 5 years of age, especially in certain breeds (eg,
Golden Reriever). Depending upon the location and size of the tumot, such patients may appear
neurologically norimal interictally
A definitive diagnosis of a brain tumor cannot he made without a biopsy sample; however, a
very confilent tentative diagnosis can often be made by imaging the brain tumor in a suspect
patient. Before pursuing advanced imaging, basic bloodwork (complete blood count, or CBC,
and chemistry profile) and a urinalysis should be performed. Thoracic radiographs should be
taken to hclp rule out the possibility of mctastatic cancer. Computed tomography and MR
imaging are commonly used in the diagnosis of brain tumors, with MRis being the preferred
imaging modality. Alchough specifc types of brain rumors can vary in their appcaranc with
these imaging modalities, there are some characteristic fcarurcs that help distinguish meningio-
mas from gliomas. Meningiomas tend to have a broad-based, extra-axial attachment (they arise
from the periphery of the brain and move inward, or axially), exhibit distinct tumor margins,
and uniformly contrast enhance (Fig. 5.21). Meningiomas tend to displace, rather than invade,
parenchymal tissuc. Some meningiomas will calcify, which can be appreciared on a noncontrast
CT image (Fig. 5.22). The “dural rail sign is an MRI feature typically associated wich meningio-
mas in which a contrast-cnhancing meningeal-associated “tail" is seen extending from the main
tumor mass (Tig. 5.23). Meningiomas also may occasionally have a cystic component (cystic

meningioma) extending from the main tumor mass (Fig. 5.24). Gliomas tend to arise from an
intra-axial location (from within the substance of the brain, moving outward), often lack distinct
tumor margins (they tend to infltrate,rather than displace normal tissue), and typically contrast
enhance poorly and nonuniformly (Fig. 5.25). Choroid plexus tumors and ependymomas tend to
be intraventricular in location and often uniformly contrast enhance (Fig. 5.26). The phenom-
enon of “ring enhancement,” in which a circular ring of contrast enhancement surrounds nonen-
hancing tissue (Fig. 5.27), is nonspecific and has been associated with several neoplastic and
non-neoplasticbrain diseases.However,ring enhancement is often associatedwithgliomas.

Meningeal contrast enhancement evident on MRIs of the brain has been described but is not
specific for brain tumors. These typical imaging features are guidelines only. Meningiomas
can arise from the falx cerebri or the choroid plexus and appear intra-axial. Gliomas can be
peripherally located and contrast enhancing. In a recent study, the accuracy of predicting primary
tumor type based on MRIs of 20 dogs was 65%. Stereotactic CT-guided biopsy of brain tumors
is now available at several veterinary referral centers. With this new technology, a definitive
diagnosis may be obtained at the time of imaging without the need for major intracranial
surgery.
The utility of CSF evaluation for the suspected brain tumor patient is controversial. Cere-
brospinal fuid is often abnormal in patients with brain tumors, but the white blood cell (WBC)
162

counts and protein levels are variable and nonspecific for ncoplasia. In fact, dogs and cats with
meningiomas tend to have CSF with predominantly polymorphonuclear (neutrophilic) WBC
counts. The author often does not pursue CSF analysis if the CT or MRI strongly suggests a
brain neoplasm. Although the risk of CSF procurement in the face of elevated intracranial
pressure (ICP) in a brain tumor patient is often not great, the potential benefit of a nonspecific
CSF result may not outweigh even a small chance of harming the patient with the procedure.
Although CSF analysis tends to yield fairly nonspecific information in brain tumor cases, it may
be useful in helping to distinguish whether a choroid plexus tumor is a CPP or CPC. In one
study, the more malignant CPC was significantly more likely to be associated with a CSF protein
whether CSF analysis is performed, imaging should always precede CSF analysis when a focal
neoplasm is highly suspected. Anesthetizing a patient who is most likely to have a brain tumor
solely for the purpose of obtaining CSF is generally contraindicated, as the resultant information
is unlikely to assist in either planning treatment or estimating prognosis.
d.
Treatment of primary brain tumors is divided into the categories of supportive and definitive.
Supportive therapy is aimed at alleviation of the secondary effects of the tumor, whereas defini
tive therapy is directed toward diminishing tumor volume or eliminating the tumor. Supportive
therapy typically consists of an anti-infammatory dose of oral prednisone (0.5 mg/kg, q 12 hr)

that can be increased or decreased, dependent upon patient response. The prednisone should
decrease ICP by relieving tumor-associated brain edema and decreasing CSF production. If the
tumor results in seizure activity, anticonvulsant drugs are also prescribed. The author has found
that administering standard doses of phenobarbital to dogswith rostral forebrain tumors tends to
cause profound sedation. There are several relatively new and effective anticonvulsant drugs
available for dogs that do not have appreciable sedative effects.The author preferentially chooses
felbamate, zonisamide, or levetiracetam for use in dogs with brain tumors, unless it is cost-
definitive therapy for their pet.
There are numerous definitive trcatment modalities available for canine and feline brain
tumors,but surgical removal/debulking and megavoltage radiation are most commonly used. In
addition to removing cancerous tissue, surgical debulking/removal allows for a histologic diagno-
sis as well as potentially providing an immediate decompressive effect (decreasing ICP). Feline
meningiomas are typically located over the cerebral convexities and tend to “peel away” from
normal brain tissue at surgery (Fig. 5.28). In most cases, feline meningiomas can be relatively
easily removed en masse.Although meningiomas are believed to be radiation sensitive in cats,
information concerning radiation therapy for this tumor is lacking, probably due to the success
of complete surgical removal. There are no reports describing definitive therapy of feline gliomas.
The use of both surgery and radiation therapy have been described in a small number of cats

with intracranial cpendymoma. Descriptions of definitive therapy for canine brain tumors other
than meningiomas and gliomas are largely anecdotal. Canine meningiomas are also often located
over the cerebral cortical surface and are surgically accessible. However, meningiomas in the
cerebellar and brain stem regions are frequently encountered in dogs. Cerebellar meningiomas are
often surgically accessible; meningiomas in the brain stem may not be accessible. Meningiomas
in dogs are much less predictable than those in cats in terms of ease of surgical removal. Unlike
cats, there are multiple histologic subtypes of canine meningiomas, and nearly one-third of these
tumors are invasive. The author has successfully used intraoperative ultrasound (Fig. 5.29) to
assist in locating brain tumors and to judge completeness of removal. Canine meningiomas are
generally thought to be radiation sensitive. A combination of surgical debulking and radiation
therapy is often pursued for canine meningiomas. Surgically inaccessible meningiomas are often
treated with radiation therapy alone. Some canine gliomas are surgically accessible, but surgical
infltrate normal brain parenchyma, and it is often difficult to discern tumor margin from brain
tissue at surgery. Although gliomas are not thought to be as radiation sensitive as meningiomas,

radiation therapy is often pursued as either a primary or adjunctive therapy for canine gliomas.
The current standard protocol for definitive megavoltage radiation therapy of brain tumors is
administration of fractionated daily doses of 2.5-4 Gy on a Monday-through-Friday (once a day)
schedule for 3 weeks.Protocols vary,but most involve the administration of a total cumulative
dose in the range of 40-50 Gy.

Chemotherapy has traditionally been regarded as ineffective for canine and feline brain
tumors, mainly due to the poor ability of most drugs to cross the BBB, even when disturbed by
the presence of a tumor.However, there are several reports of usingnitrosourea compounds such
as lomustine (CCNU) and carmustine (BCNU) for canine gliomas. These highly lipid-soluble
alkylating agents cross the BBB readily and are used to treat human intracranial gliomas. Oral
lomustine, at a dosage of 60 mg/m² every 6-8 wccks, is recommended for dogs. Since lomustine
can cause severe neutropenia, weekly to biweekly CBCs should be checked during treatment,
beginning 1 week after drug administration.Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated if the
ncutrophil count drops below 1000 cells per milliter. If myelosuppression is prolonged, admin-
istration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (Neupogen) is recommended. The dose for
Neupogen is 5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously for 3 to 5 days. The same hepatic microsomal
enzymes necessary for generating antineoplastic metabolites from lomustine are also involved in
the metabolism of phenobarbital. In order to minimize the possibility of reduced drug cffcacy of
lomustine, it is recommended that alternatives to phenobarbital be used in scizurc paticnts
receiving lomustine therapy. In addition to the potential for bone marrow suppression with oral
lomustine use, delayed dose-related hepatoxicity has also been reported to occur in approximately
6%ofcases.
Hydroxyurea is an oral chemotherapeutic agent with efficacy against intracranial meningio
mas in people. Proposed mechanisms of action of hydroxyurea include induction of tumor cell
apoptosis and inhibition of ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase (with subsequent interference
with DNA synthesis). The dose of hydroxyurea used in people is 20 mg/kg SID. The author and
colleagues have adapted this protocol for dogs with intracranial meningiomas. Dogs treated with
only hydroxyurea and prednisone (i.e., no surgery or radiation therapy) have had an average
survival time of approximately 7-8 months in the author's experience. Mild to moderate bone
marrow suppression is a potential side effect of hydroxyurea use in people. To date, this side
effect has not been an issue in dogs.
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often applied directly to the tumor in human brain
tumor treatment. Such focal therapy offers the advantage of administering a large dose of
treatment to the tumor, while minimizing toxicity to normal tissue. These focal therapies have
notbeen extensively evaluatedindogs andcats.With therecentavailability ofstereotactic

poor. The majority of these animals will die or be euthanized due to worsening neurologic
dysfunction within 1-4 months of initial presentation. Other than feline meningioma, prognos-
tic information regarding individual primary brain tumors is highly variable and somewhat
conflicting. This is probably due to the lack of controlled studies with large numbers of patients
for each of these tumors, as well as the diverse biological behaviors of these tumors compared to
feline meningiomas.The prognosis for long-term survival in cats with intracranial meningiomas
is typically good to excellent with surgical removal. Median postoperative survival timcs based
upon two studies were 21.7 and 27 months. Considering the advanced age of some cats at the
time of meningioma removal, it should be kept in mind that not all deaths are attributable to
Regrowth of intracranial meningioma in cats is usually in the original tumor location. In the
author's clinical experience, the success rate of re-operation of feline intracranial rneningioma is
similar to the reported success rate of first-time operation of these tumors. In other words, re-
removal ofrecurrentfelineintracranialmeningiomas shouild beconsidered a logical therapeutic
option.Simultaneous removal ofmultiple intracranial meningiomas in catsis also associatedwith
prolonged survival times. Three cats with intracranial ependymoma were treated with radiation
therapy, and one of these three also had surgery performed. One of the cats (treated with radia-
tion alone) lived for approximately 4 months; the other rwo survived for well over a year.

in comparison with the feline disease.The prognosis for readily resectable meningiomas in dogs
is considered fair,but canine meningiomas are not commonly as easily resectable as feline
meningiomas. In one report of 4 dogs with intracranial meningiomas, the median postoperative
survival time was 4.6 months. In another report of 14 dogs, the median postoperative survival
time was 6.6 months. In onc small case series, three dogs with surgically excised intracranial
meningiomas lived an average of 6.7 months following surgery. A fourth dog was euthanized 2.5

days.
Results of megavoltage radiation treatrment of primary brain tumors are also variable. In one
study,radiation therapy for caninemeningiomas as a sole therapy resulted in median survival
times between 5 and 9 months. In a more recent report, hypofractionated radiation therapy was
associated with median survival times of 12.5 months and 10 months for dogs with extra-axial
(probable meningiomas) and intra-axial (probable gliomas) tumors, respectively. In one study of
29 dogs with primary brain tumors treated via megavoltage radiation therapy, the median
survival time was 250 days. In a more recent study evaluating megavoltage radiation therapy as a
sole definitive therapy for 46 dogs with brain tumors, the median survival time was 699 days
(23.3 months), and the median survival time attributed to neurologic deterioration was 1174
days. In a study that evaluated stereotactic radiosurgcry for delivering a single focused high dose
of megavoltage radiation to a tumor using advanced imaging, the median survival was 426 days
overall and 584 days if corrected for patients dying from unrelated disorders. In this report, there
was no significant effect of rumor type on survival time.
Survival times of dogs with meningiomas receiving surgical debulking/removal followed by
megavoltage radiation therapy range from approximately 16 months to 3 years. The limited
168
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
information concerning definitive therapy of canine meningiomas suggests that combination
surgery and radiation therapy may be necessary for prolonged survival in many cases. In a recent
report of 21 dogs with olfactory bulb/frontal lobe meningiomas, mean/median survival times for
supportive therapy (6.5 months /3.8 months), surgery alone (8.3 months /6.7 months), surgery
plus hydroxyurea (18.3 months /18.4 months), and surgery plus megavoltage radiation therapy
(18.7 months /16.9 months) were described. In a report of 10 dogs with choroid plexus tumors
(8 CPP 2 CPC), the median survival of 8 treated dogs (6 via supportive care, 2 via surgical
debulking) was 8 days. Four of the 10 dogs had megaesophagus and 2 of these 4 had aspiration
pneumonia. The eight reported cases of meningioangiomatosis are all necropsy descriptions.
Reported cases of primary brain histiocytic sarcoma (malignant histiocytosis) are also confined to
 pathological descriptions. The author removed a primary cerebral extra-axial histiocytic sarcoma
from a Labrador Retriever, who subsequently received megavoltage radiation therapy; at last
recheck examination, ovcr 2 years after diagnosis, the dog was still alive and doing well.
Gliomas are associated with a poor prognosis. Data concerning surgical therapy for canine
intracranial gliomas are almost nonexistent. Radiation therapy as a sole treatment in 10 dogs
with gliomas resulted in a median survival time of approximately 6 months. Several reports on
the use of nitrosourea compounds (carmustine, lomustine) suggest an important role for this
form of chemotherapy in the treatment of gliomas; survival times ranging from 7 to 11 months
have been documented. There is no information available concerning the prognosis of other
primary canine and feline brain tumors.
There have been sevcral rccent reports focusing on molecular aspects of canine brain tumors
for purposes of both predicting prognosis and devising novel therapeutic approaches. Tumor-
specific genes have reccntly been identified for dogs, many of which are similar to those
described in humans. Several types of receptors and ccllular proteins have also been identified in
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and a nuclear protein called MIB-1. 'The majority of
canine and feline meningiomas appear to have progesterone receptors. There is a positive associa-
tion with PCNA level and likelihood of tumor recurrence and a negative association with PCNA
degree of malignancy and increased expression of VEGF and MIB-1 in canine brain tumors. In
addition, elevated CSF levels of uric acid (an indicator of oxidative injury and potential gluta-
mate excitotoxicity) and glutamate have been demonstrated in dogs with primary brain tumors.
There is currently work underway aimed at targeting brain tumors using viral vector-mediated
genetransfer.

Secondary brain tumors include metastatic
oplasia aswell as tumors that affect thcbrain by
prostatic carcinoma,hemangiosarcoma,malignant melanoma,and lymphosarcoma.Tumors that
may extend into the brain from the periphery include nasal and frontal sinus carcinoma (adeno-
carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma), calvarial tumors (e.g., osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma,
secondary brain tumors in dogs, the most common sccondary brain tumor was hemangiosarcoma
(29%), followed by pituitary tumors (25%), lymphosarcoma (12%), metastatic carcinoma
(11%), and invasive nasal tumors (6%). In one recent repor, secondary (multicentric) lym-
phoma andpituitary tumors were the second and third most common intracranial neoplasms
found in cats. Other reports suggest that lymphoma/lymphosarcoma is the most common
secondary brain tumor type encountered in cats. An intracerebral (intraventricular) plasma cell
tumor has been reported in a cat (necropsy report), but it was not determined whether this was a
primary or secondary (i.e., multiple myeloma) tumor. A dog exhibiting clinical signs similar to

human pituitary apoplexy (acule onset of headache, vomiting, altered mentation, and hormonal
ropsy, the dog was found to have a pituitary adenoma with intra- aind peri-tumoral hemorrhage.
Similar to primary brain tumors, secondary brain tumors produce clinical signs of neurologic
dysfunction both by cncroaching upon/invading brain tissue and by secondary effects such as
hemorrhage, inflammation, and ohstructivc hydrocephalus.
b.As with primary brain tumors, secondary brain tumors are primarily encountered in middlc-aged
to older dogs (usually) and cats. Medium-sized to large-breed dolichocephalic dogs are prone to
developing nasal/frontal sinus carcinomas and calvarial tumors, whereas small and brachycephalic
study mentioned carlier, the mean age of dogs with sccondary brain tumors was similar to that of
primary brain tumors (9.6 years). Mixcd brcds were most common, followed by Golden
Retrievers and Labrador Retricvcrs. On postmortem examinarion of thesc dogs, mctastatic Icsions
were found in the lung (47%), kidney (35%), and heart (31%). Thoracic radiographs were
abnormal in over half of the cases in which chest films were perforned. Only 30% of secondary
brain lesions were reported as multifocal in distribution. An additional, unrelated neoplasm was
found in 18% of the dogs. This study also found that secondary brain tumors were slightly more
common than prinary brain tumors for the tine period evaluated. Since all the evaluated cases
were confrmed by postmortem examination, the higher number of secondary brain tumors may
rather than a truly higher incidence of secondary brain tumors in thc dog population.
Clinical signs of ncurologic dysfunction rcfect tumor location(s) within the brain as well as
the degree of secondary cffccts of the tumor(s). Unlike primary brain tumors, sccondary brain
tumors are often associated with rapid developrnent of neurologic dysfiunction. Patients with
(c.g, collapse due to hemorrhage from a splenic hemangiosarcoma). Dogs with nasal carcinomas
often, but not always, have historical/clinical evidence of epistaxis. Obvious skull deformities may
be appreciable with nasal/frontal carcinomas and calvarial tumors. Most dogs with pituitary
macroadenomas largc enoughi to cause neurologic dysfunction display clinical signs of hyperadre-

 Similar to primary brain rumors, definitive diagnosis of secondary brain tumors depends upon
tactic biopsy may be potentially helpful in diagnosing some secondary brain tumors. In the case
of metastatic neoplasia, identifying an extraneural neoplasia (e.g., pulmonary mass) in a patient
with sigus of encephalopathy is strong evidence for a secondary brain tunor. Ie must be kept in
mind, however, that older animals may develop two or more primary tumors concurrently. A
solitary pulmonary niass ini a dog exhibiting signs of focal forcbrain dysfunction does not
necessarily equate to metastatic disease. Although rare, intracranial meningiomas have also been

Nasal/frontal sinus carcinomas tend to cause bony destruction, which is readily visible on
Similarly, calvarial tumors are often readily visualized with radiographs or CT/MR imaging (Fig.

of invasion into the cranial cavity (Fig.5.33). Imaging a calvarial osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma,
or multilobular osteochondrosarcoma with CT can be invaluablein both diagnosis and treatment
planning.
In addition to typical historical and clinical features of hyperadrenocorticism, diagnosis of
pituitary macroadenomas is based upon results of endocrine testing (e.g., ACTH stimulation,
dexamethasone suppression tests) and identifying a mass in the region of the pituitary on a CT
(Fig. 5.34) or MR image.

d.Supportive treatment of secondary brain tumors in dogs and cats is identical to that for primary
brain tumors.Also, as with primary brain tumors, surgery and radiation therapy are the main
definitive treatment modalities available for secondary brain tumors. Definitive treatment of
metastatic secondary brain tumors is rarely attempted due to the poor prognosis associated with
these tumors, even in the absence of brain involvement. In some cases of single metastases (e.g
pulmonary carcinoma), definitive treatment of both the primary and secondary neoplasms may
beindicated.
Nasal/frontal carcinomas with invasion into the cranial cavity arc also rarcly treated, as the
prognosis for cven short-term control of neurologic dysfunction is considered poor. Patients with
calvarial tumors (e.g., multilobular osteochondrosarcoma),if aggressively treated with surgical
resection,are likely to have prolonged survival times.Theseneoplasms are slow to recur and
metastasize. In one report, the median survival time for multilobular osteochondrosarcoma of the
skull was approximately 26 months.
Pituitary adenomas are felt to be radiation sensitive, and median survival times afer mega-
voltage irradiation are reported to be approximately 1-2 years in dogs. In one report of eight cats
with pituitary tumors (six adenomas,two carcinomas), the median survival with megavoltage
radiation therapy was 17.4 months. Although traditionally rarely pursued due to technical
complexity, excellent results of hypophysectomy via a transsphenoidal surgical approach have
recently been documented in dogs with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. This proce-
dure is primarily intended for removal of fairly small pituitary masses (i.e., as a treatment for
hyperadrenocorticism) rather than as a mode of treatment for large pituitary tumors causing
signs of cncephalopathy.
In a report of trigeminal (CN V) nerve sheath tumors in dogs, the median survival time of
nontreated cases was 12 months. Two dogs treated with surgery were alive at the time of publica
euthanized due to progressive neurologic dysfunction 5 months after surgery.

E.Nutritional
a.Thiamine deficiency is rarely a clinical problem in dogs and cats. Thiamine must be provided in
the diet, as dogs and cats are unable to produce it endogenously. Thiamine (vitamin B) is a
necessary cofactor for normal carbohydrate oxidation, and its deficiency results in insufficient
ATP production in the brain, with subsequent neuronal dysfunction and death (if not treated).
Fish is high in thiaminase, and feeding an all-fish diet to cats can lead to thiamine deficiency.
Overcooking canned food or meat, causing heat destruction of thiamine, has led to thiamine
deficiency in dogs. Feeding meat preserved with sulfur dioxide to dogs and cats may also result in
thiamine deficiency. There is a report of seven related Kuvasz puppies (from two litters) with a
degenerative encephalomyelopathy that may have been due to amprolium-induced thiamine
deficiency. Alternatively, these puppies may have suffered from a heritable metabolic neurodegen-
erative disorder.
b. Neurologic dysfunction due to thiamine deficiency tends to be acute and rapidly progressive. In
both dogs and cats, signs of neurologic dysfunction due to thiamine deficiency typically include
vestibular ataxia, decreased mentation (obtundation leading to coma, if not treated), ventrofex-
ion of the head and neck, seizure activity, pupillary dilation with absent menace responses, and
head tremors. Left untreated, affected animals progress to a comatose state with opisthotonus
(decerebrate posture) and ultimately death.
C.Antemortem diagnosis of thiamine deficicncy is typically based upon characteristic clinical signs
of thiamine deficiency in a dog or cat receiving a thiamine-deficient diet. A positive response to
thiamine administration also supports the diagnosis. Elevated blood pyruvate and lactate levels
and decreased erythrocyte transketolase activity are supportive of the diagnosis, but these tests are
rarely done. There are reports of MR imaging in dogs with thiamine deficiency; similar to other
metabolic encephalopathies, bilaterally symmetric brain lesions (hyperintense on T2-weighted
images) were evident. In animals that die due to thiamine deficiency, characteristic bilaterally
symmetric lesions (petechial hemorrhages) are appreciable throughout the brain at nccropsy,
especially in the caudal coliculi of the midbrain.
d.Treatment of suspected thiamine deficiency is thiamine hydrochloride via the intravenous,
intramuscular, or subcutaneous route. The dosage for dogs is 5-50 mg/day and for cats, 1--
20 mg/day. If recognized and treated early, the prognosis for survival of thiamine deficiency is
good. If not treated rapidly in the early period of neurologic dysfunction, the prognosis for
survival is guarded to poor.
F.Inflammatory/infectious
A wide variety of inflammiatory brain conditions affects dogs and cats. For some of these conditions, an
infectious agent is identifable. For others, no infectious agent has been found. Some of the inflammatory
brain diseases may have an autoimmune etiology. Diagnosis and trcatment of infammatory brain disorders
can be frustrating. The classical description of a dog or cat with an inflammatory/infectious brain disease is
a patient with a multifocal/diffuse encephalopathy, often with sevcrc cervical spinal hyperesthesia.With
infectious etiologies espccially, fever and abnormal CBC results are often expected. In many cases, the
affected patient will not follow the classical description of an inflammatory/infectious encephalopathy.
Historical, clinical, and laboratory data are typically combined in an effort to arrive at an antemortem
diagnosis and institute appropriate therapy. Cerebrospinal fluid results may be particularly helpful when
diagnosing diseases in this category. In one report, a specific diagnosis was not ascribable to at least one
third of canine infectious/inflammatory disorders of the CNS. In the majority of canine and feline inflam-
matory brain diseases, especially those of confrmed infectious etiology, the prognosis for survival is poor.
Prognostic data for many of these diseases are based mainly upon casc reports and publications that focus
on the pathologic aspects of the specific diseases. Considering the wide variety of potential clinical presenta
tions for infammatory/infectious brain disorders and the frequent requirement of timely and aggressive

treatment for successful outcomes,the clinician should maintain a high index of suspicionforthese diseases.
The pathophysiology of infectious meningoencephalitis is complex and is briefy reviewed below in the
discussion of bacterial meningoencephalitis. There are numerous treatment regimens for the various infec-
tious agents discussed below, and this text is meant to provide an overview of these treatiment options. The
suggested references should be consulted for more detailed information.
a.In general,bacterial infections of the nervous system are felt to be uncommon.It is not clear
whether these infections are truly rare or are rarely reported due to high early mortality. Bacteria
can gain access to the brain via the hematogenous route or by extension of infection from a
neighboring focus (e.g., extension of otitis interna into the brain stem). The BBB and absence of
a lymphatic system in the CNS help prote
ct it from microbial invasion, Once the BBB has been
successfully breached by an infectious agent, the immunologically privileged nature of the CNS
represents an advantage to the invading organism and a detriment to the host. The CNS is
poorly endowed with immunologically
active cells and complement, the lack of which provides a
favorable environment for bacterial growth. Once cells from the systemic immune system are
recruited into the CNS,the infection is often well established.
Bacterial infections of the brain may result in neurologic dysfunction by producing a mass
effect (i.e., organized abscess) or release of bacterial toxins.However, the main cause of neuro-
logic deficits is the secondary inflammatory response induced by the bacteria. Inflammatory
mediators, such as interferons, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), prostaglandins, and kinins are
produced by WBCs in response to bacteria. These mediators result in edema, vasculitis, and
infarction.By attracting additional WBCs to the infection focus or foci (chemotaxis), a sclf
perperuation of tissue damage cnsues. The most comimonly implicated organisms in canine and
feline bacterial meningocncephalitis have been Staphylococcus and Streptococcus specics, Pasteurella
multocida (especially cats), Aclinomyces and Nocardia species, as well as anaerobes (e.g., bacteroi-
des, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium). In a rccent report of canine bacterial menin-
and Klebsiell species.Gram-negative infections were most common, and single versus multiple
organism infections were equally likely. Bartonella species have recently been implicated as
potential causes of CNS disease in dogs and cats.
b. Dogs and cats of any age, breed, or sex may develop bacterial meningoencephalitis, but it is more
dogs were purebred, with a median age of 5 years at presentation. Clinical signs of neurologic
dysfunction are ofen acute and rapidly progressive. Fever and cervical hyperesthesia are consid-
ered classical features of bacterial meningoencephalitis, but they may not be evident. Fever and
cervical hyperesthesia have been reported to occur in approximately 40% and 20% of canine
bacterial meningoencephalitis cases, respectively. As with other diseases, clinical signs of neuro-
logic dysfunction depend upon the location(s) and extent of the lesion(s). Both focal and multi-
focal encephalopathies are possibilities, involving the forebrain and/or brain stem. Some patients
C.A tentative diagnosis of bacterial meningoencephalitis is based upon historical and clinical data,
as wellas results of laboratory tests. A positive response to antibiotic drugs also supports the
diagnosis. CBC results may indicate a systemic infammatory response, but this is often not the
case. Abnormalities such as leukocytosis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported
to occur in approximately 57% of canine bacterial meningoencephalitis cases. Abnormalities on
serum chemistry profiles (e.g., elevated alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and serum alkaline
phosphatase [SAP] levels, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia) are apparent in over 70% of such cases.
Advanced imaging (CT, MR) may be helpful in diagnosing mass lesions (Fig. 5.35) or obstruc-
tive hydrocephalus. The most valuable information is obtained from CSF analysis, which is
abnormal in over 90% of cases. With acute bacterial meningoencephalitis, a suppurative CSF

empyema) from a dog bite wound.
pattern, often with degenerate and toxic-appearing neutrophils, is typical. Protein levels are also
often elevated. The presence of intracellular bacteria in the CSF sample confirms the diagnosis.
Extracellular bacteria may represent causative agents but may also be contaminants. Positive CSF,
blood, and/or urine culture results also support the diagnosis of bacterial meningoencephalitis.
Since these culture results are often negative (approximately 80%) in confirmed bacterial menin-
goencephalitis cases, a negative result should not be overinterpreted.
d.Ideally, antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis is based upon culture/sensitivity
results of the causative organism. As this is often not obtainable, antibiotic therapy is often based
organisms are not seen. Appropriate antibiotics for bacterial meningoencephalitis should ideally
be bactericidal, have low-level protein binding, and be able to cross the BBB. Intravenous
therapy is recommended for at least the initial 3 to 5 days of therapy. High intravenous doses of
ampicillin (c.g., 22 mg/kg, q 6 hr) have been recommended as an appropriate therapeutic choice
for most cases of canine and feline bacterial meningoencephalitis. Ampicillin crosses the infamed
BBB relatively well and is bactericidal. If a gram-negative infection is suspected or confirmed
enrofloxacin (e.g, 10 mg/kg IV, q 12 hr) or a third-gencration cephalosporin (e.g., cefotaxime at
 25-50 mg/kg IV, q 8 hr) are good choices. Meronidazole (10 mg/kg IV, slowly, q 8 hr) is an
excellent antibiotic choice for most anaerobic infections. Intravenous metronidazole should be
administered over 30-40 minutes, as rapid infusion can lead to hypotension. In severe cases of
bacterial meningoencephalitis,it may be prudent to institute combination antimicrobial therapy
while awaiting CSF laboratory results (gram stain, culture results). Based on information con-
cerning causative agents in canine bacterial meningoencephalitis, inclusion of antibiotics with
strong activity against gram-negative bacteria is highly recommended. Although chloramphenicol
is broad spectrum and readily crosses the BBB, its use in human and experimental canine
bacterial meningitis has been associated with a high relapse rate, presumably due to the bacterio-
static nature of this drug. Once a positive response to intravenous antibiotic therapy is achieved,
the patient can be switched to oral therapy. Trimethoprim-sulfonamide (15 mg/kg PO, q 12 hr)
is broad and bactericidal, and it readily penetrates the BBB, even when the BBB is not infamed.
Oral formulations of enrofloxacin and metronidazole are also available. Recommendations for the
length of oral antibiotic therapy vary.Discontinuation of antibiotic therapy is ideally based both
on clinical signs as well as normal follow-up CSF tap results. However,the latter-mentioned
information is often not available. In general, antibiotic therapy should be administered for 10-
14 days after resolution of clinical signs of disease.
Although glucocorticoid use in the face of infection is usually contraindicated, there is
abundant evidence that transicnt (maximum of 4 days), anti-infammatory doses (e.g-
176
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone, IV, q 6 hr) of glucocorticoids improve outcomes in people with
bacterial meningitis. Such therapy should be considered for dogs and cats with this disorder. If
CT or MR imaging localizes a surgically accessible abscess, surgical intervention may play an
imporant role in the management of bacterial meningoencephalis.
Unfortunately, there are no reports describing large groups of dogs or cats treated appropri-
ately for confrmed bacerial meningoencephalitis. Thc sparse information available sugests a
poor prognosis overall. Hlowever, survival rates in peoplc appropriately treated for bacterial
meningitis are over 70%. Thierc are isolated reports of successfil outcomes in cases of canine and
feline bacterial mcningocncephalitis. Similar to human bacterial CNS infections, the key to
successful therapy of dogs and cars with bacterial meningoencephalitis is carly diagnosis and
rapid, aggressive therapy.

a.There is a wide variety of fungal organisms that may invade the CNS, including the genera
Cryptacoccs, Coccidioides, Blastomyces, Histoplasma, Aspergilus and the phaeohiyphomycoses (e.g
with meningocncephalitis in dogs and cats. Meningoencephalitis due to coccidioidomycosis has
recently been reported in 36 dogs. Fungal disease is typically contractcd by dogs and cats via
inhalation of fungal spores, Infection of the CNS can occur via local extension (e.g, nasal/frontal
sinus) or hematogenously. Similar to bacterial CNS infection, clinical signs of neurologic dys-

with fungal CNS infections, an underlying state of immunosuppression is usually present. While
this may also be the case in some canine and feline CNS fungal infections, an uderlying
inrmunodeficiency state is often not identificd in dogs and cats with fungal meningoencephalitis.
b. As with bacterial mcningocncephalitis, dogs and cats with fungal meningoencephalitis are
typically young to middlc-aged (e.g., 1-7 years). American Cocker Spanicls and Siamese cats
appear to be predisposed to developing CNS cryptococcosis. Although clinical signs of neuro-
logic dysfunction may be acute in onset and rapidly progressive, fungal meningoencephalitis is
often characterized by slow progression (weeks to months) of neurologic dysfunction, often
preceded by a period of nonspecific illness (e.g., lethargy, anorexia). Focal and multifocal enceph-
alopathy are possible, affecting the forebrain and/or brain stem. Clinical evidence of extraneural
fungal infection is common in cases of fungal meningoencephalitis. With cryptococcosis, extra-
neural infection around the head region (eycs, nasal, and frontal sinuses) is most likely. With
coccidioidomycosis, initial infection of the pulmonary systcm is typical.
C.The diagnosis of fungal meningocncephalitis is based upon idenrifying the presence of a fungal
 organism in a patient displaying signs of ercephalopathy. Finding a fungal organism in an
extraneural site in a patient with brain dysfunction is strong evidencc for fungal meningocnceph-
alitis. Brain imaging (preferably MR imaging) is likely to demonstrate intra-axial lcsions that
perilesional edema. Identifying the organism in a CSF sample is the strongest evidence to
support the diagnosis, and this is morc likely to occur with Cryptococcus infections (93% in dogs)
than with othcr fungal infections. Spccial stains are available to help identify specific fungi on
cytology specimens. CNS fungal infections typically cause a mixed-cell pleocytosis with elevation
of protein on CSF examination, The nature of the pleocytosis is bighly variable, but usually
includes a large proporrion of both mononuclear cells as well as neutrophils, typical of a granulo-
matous disease. In the report of dogs with intracranial coccidioidomycosis, mononuclear pleocy-
tosis was most commonly demonstrated, followed by mixed-cell pleocytosis. Eosinophils may
also comprise a large proportion of CSF WBCs in fungal meningoencephalitis patients. Testing
of CSF and/or serum for antibodies to fungal antigens can also be performed. These tests are
very reliable for Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces infections, less so for Aspergillus

infections,and unreliable for Histoplasma infections.No such tests are available for the phaeohy
phomycoses. The various fungi can also be cultured from bodily fuids, using special growth
media; this can be hazardous to human health in the case of coccidioidomycosis and
histoplasmosis.
Blood work abnormalities are variable and nonspecific. Nonregenerative low-grade anemia,
neutrophilia, and hypercalcemia (due to granulomatous disease) are examples of such abnormali-
ties. Fungal elements may be identifiable in urine samples. Ophthalmic examination may reveal
evidence of inflammatory disease (e.g, uveitis, chorioretinitis). Pulmonary lesions may be
identifiable in some cases (e.g., Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Coccidioides) on thoracic radiographs.
178 
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
Cats with suspected or confirmed fungal meningoencephalitis should be tested for feline lcukc
mia virus (leLV) and feline immunodefciency virus (FIV).
 The treatment and prognosis for canine and feline fungal meningoencephalitis are poorly
defned.Although antifungal drugs constitute the rmainstay of treatment for these cases, surgical
rcmoval/dchulking of large intracranial granulomas may sometimes be indicated. Similar to
bacterial meningoencephalitis, data describing large numbers of dogs and cats with CNS fungal
disease treated with appropriate antifungal agcnts are lacking. Meningoencephalitis caused by
Aspergillus or phaeohyphoinycosis species is likely ro be fatal. Fcw antifungal drugs are able to
cross the BBB effectively, even whcn it is inflamed. However, fucytosine (5-fluorocytosinc) and
the triazole drug fuconazole are two antifungal drugs that readily cross thc BBB. There arc
sevcral rcports of sustained remissions or cures in CNS cryptococcosis patients trcated with drug
combinations that inchuded fucytosine and/or the newer triazole drugs (itraconazole and fucon-
azole). Flucytosine use alone may lead to the development of drug resistance. In a report of 36
dogs with intracranial coccidioidomycosis, 84% of dogs improved or resolved with Huconazole
therapy. Once clinical signs of disease are controlled, most patients with fungal meningoencepha-
litis will require long-term antifungal therapy (months). ln the author's experience, fuconazole
therapy for fungal meningoencephalitis cases may nced to be very prolonged, often exceeding a
year. In the report of 36 dogs with coccidioidomycosis meningoencephalitis, the iminimurm
treatment time was 1 year. The decision regarding when to disconitinue antifungal therapy should
be based upon clinical signs, repeat CSF resules, and CSF/serum titers for the organism (if
appropriate). Since fuconazolc penetrates the BBB well and itraconazole does not, fuconazole
for CNS fungal infection is the preferred antifungal agent (5 mg/kg PO, q 12 hr). The main
drawback of fuconazolc use is the high cost of the drug. Although controversial, it may be
beneficial to administer low doses of oral prednisonc (c.g., 0.5 mg/kg BID) in the early treatment
period (l-2 weeks) in order to combat perilesional edema.

is associated with a high mortality rate due to severe systemic illness. Surviving dogs may have

rabies from ingestion of infected raw pork meat. FlV may also be spread via bite wounds. There

b. As with other CNS infectious diseases, afected animals are often young to middle-aged. Viral
CNS infections typically run an acute to subacute course but may be peracute (e.g., pscudora-
bies) or insidious (FIP) in onset and progression. Clinical signs of multifocal cnccphalopathy arc

(polioencephalopathy), with predominant signs of forebrain dysfunction. Seizures are common

possible exposure to wildlife or other nonvaccinated dogs or cats should alert the clinician to
consider rabies. The typical “furious" and “paralytic” forms of rabies have been described. The
furious form is more common in cats and is characterized by apprehension and aggression,
suggesting primarily forcbrain dysfunction. The paralytic form, encountered more frequently in
dogs, is characterized by LMN dysfunction of brain stem nuclei, leading to a dropped jaw
(CN V) and swallowing difficulty with artendant ptyalism (CN IX-XI). Respiratory difficulty
and gait abnormalities may also be apparent. Focal and/or generalized seizure activity may
occur with either form of rabies. Dogs and cats with rabies may present with a wide variety of
clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction, and the above-mentioned forms of rabies should be
viewed as very rough guidelines. It has been aptly stated that the only typical feature of the
clinical signs of rabies is that they tend to be atypical. A young dog with rapidly progressive

reported.

FIV-associated encephalopathy has recently been reported and may be more common than
previously thought. Encephalopathy may occur in as many as one-third of FIV-infected cats.

C.Definitive diagnosis of viral meningoencephalitis is usually accomplished at nccropsy. Identifica-
tion of causative virus in brain parenchyma through various methods (e.g., visualizing inclusion
bodics, immunocytochemistry, viral isolation) and thc appearance of characteristic histologic
patterns (c.g-, Pyogranulomas in FIP, demyelinating brain stcm lesions in canine distemper) help
to confirm. a diagnosis of a specific viral-induced encephalopathy. In the case of an unvaccinated
dog or cat that has died or was euthanized because of brain diseasc (of recent onset) and has had
exposure to people (especially bite wounds), examination of the brain (c.g., direct fuorescent
antibody test) for rabies is mandatory. The antemorten diagnosis of viral meningocncephalitis is
often difficult and relies on combining characteristic historical and clinical findings with several
diagnostic tests. Specific and reliable diagnostic tests for viral mieningoencephalitis are lacking.
Intuitively, identifying the presence of a viral agent in a patient displaying encephalopathic signs
would support that virus as being the causative factor. Hlowever, identifying virus of viral antigen
in body tissues or fuids is usually unsucccssful.
The indirect fuorescent antibody test for canine distemper, usually performed on conjuncti-
val scrapings, buffy coat smcars, and/or urine sediment, may produce too many false-negative
and false-positive results to be of much use. ldentification of circulating antibody against various
viruses in the blood and CSF can be readily accomplished. Since thc patient may have been
cxposedl naturally or intentionally (vaccination) to a suspect viral pathogen in the past, a positivc
scrum antibody titer often has little clinical mcaning. Similarly, in a patienr previously immu-
nized for a specifc viral disease, demonstrating a positive titerin theCSF for that viral agent has
little meaning. If the BBB is disrupted for any reason, the serum antibodies can passively move
to the CSF. Demonstrating a gradicnr of titcrs (i.c., CSF titer for an antiviral antibody higher
than the scrum titer) is more definitive evidence of that virus as the causative agent. More
recently, the use of a one-step, reverse transcriptase. polyimerasc chain feaction (RT-PCR) test to
amplify canine distemper virus-specific RNA products in serum and CSF has been described.
This PCR procedure appears to be a specifc antemorterm test for caninc distemper virus infec-
tion. The author has had a number of positivc RT-PCR results for coronavirus from CSF
procured from cats with suspected or proven neurologic FIP ln one study, RT-PCR results from
brain tissuc wcre posirive for coronavirus in 13 of 17 cats (76%) with histopathologically con-
firmed neurologic FIP Thc scnsitiviry and specificity of RT-PCR for CSF in neurologic FIP are
currently unkoown. However, it is likely that this test is sensitive but not specific for neurologic
FIP.
Some basic laboratory tests may provide supportive evidence for specific viral infections, if
abnorimal. Lymphopenia may occur with canine distemper infections, and hyperglobulinemia is
common with FIP infections. Ophthalmic examination may provide valuable clinical evidence in
some diseases (e.g, hyperreflective retinal Iesions in canine distemper). CSF values are often
abnormal with viral meningoencephalitis. Immature dogs with distemper affecting primarily gray
disease consists of predominantly mononuclear (lymphocytic) pleocytosis with elevated protein
The exception to this rule is CSF from FIP patients. The coronavirus tends to induce an intense
inmune response in this disease, and the predoiminant cell type in FIP meningoencephalitis is
usually the neutrophil, with variable numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages (a pyogranulo-
matous response). In one report, many cases of neurologic FIP had normal CSl results. A high
CSF lgG titer to feline coronavirus (greater than 1 :25) was predictivc of FIP as the cause of
neurologic dysfunction in that study. In a more recent study, however, corcnavirus titers were 11ot

image. Periventricular contrast enhancement has also been described in MR brain images of cats
with FIP meningoencephalitis (Fig. 5.37). In one small study of cats imaged with MR, half of
the cats with confrmed FIP meningoencephalitis had normal MR brain images.
d. There are no effective antiviral agents available for viral meningoencephalitis, and the prognosis
for these diseases is generally poor to grave for survival. Rabies and pseudorabies are rapidly
progressive and invariably fatal (often from respiratory failure) within 1 week and 48 hours,
respectively. FIP typically progresses over several weeks and is also invariably fatal. Most dogs
with CNS distemper infections die or are euthanized due to progressive neurologic dysfunction.
However, clinical signs of disease may remain static or improve in some dogs, and survival is
possible with proper nursing care. Anti-inflammatory doses of prednisone are often prescribed to
lessen the secondary effects ofviral infection on CNS tissue in these cases.FIV-associated
encephalopathy appears to have a chronic course without progression of clinical signs in many
cases. Although not yet reported in clinical cases, the use of zidovudine (AZT) at a dose of
50 mg per os, every 12 hr, has been recommended. Since this drug can cause myelosuppression,
regular CBCs should be performed while a cat is receiving this therapy. Cats with feline Borna

disease typically exhibit progressively worsening neurologic dysfunction, necessitating euthanasia
within 6 months of onset of clinical signs.
Toxoplasma gondi and Neospora caninum are protozoal agents known to occasionally cause
meningoencephalitis in dogs. Toxoplasma has also been reported to cause meningoencephalitis in
cats. Experimental infection of cats with Neospora may lead to meningoencephalitis, but no
naturally occurring cases have been reported. The life cycles of Toxoplasma and Neospora are
similar, the definitive hosts being cats and dogs, respectively. These protozoans are similar in
many respects. Host infection is believed to occur transplacentally (tachyzoites), via ingestion of
fecally shed oocysts (cats are the definitive hosts and shed oocysts) and/or ingestion of intermedi-
ate hosts containing the organisms (tachyzoites and bradyzoites). Neurologic dysfunction is
thought to be caused by intracellular proliferation of tachyzoites. Recently, canine and feline
b. Protozoal meningoencephalitis can occur at any age, but young animals seem more susceptible.
The onset and progression of CNS dysfunction may be acute or chronic. Clinical signs reflecting
either focal or multifocal encephalopathy are possible, Although these protozoal organisms tend
to affect multiple organ systems, clinical signs are often refective only of CNS disease. However,
clinical evidence of a concurrent myopathy may be present in dogs with protozoal
meningoencephalitis.
C.1
Diagnosis of protozoal meningoencephalitis is based upon providing evidence of active protozoal
infection in a patient with signs of encephalopathy. Further support of the diagnosis is obtained
if the patient responds favorably to antiprotozoal medication. Identifying protozoal organisms in
the living patient is unlikely, but there a
several reliable tests to identify IgG antibodies against
both Toxoplasma and Neospora in dogs and cats.Therc is no cross-reactivity between the antibody
tests for these two organisms. Since dogs
andcatsmay
ybe exposed to these organisms(and hence
produce a titer against them) without developing clinical disease, a single positive antibody titer
does not establish a causal relationship. A fourfold incrcase in serum antibody titers over several
weeks is supportive of active infection. CSF titers can also be performed and compared with
serum titers (see Chapter 4). Also, IgM antibodies can be measurcd for Toxoplasma in addition to
IgG. A positive IgM response with a negative IgG response suggests active infection.
Bloodwork may or may not reveal evidence of an inflammatory disease. Clinical proof of
ophthalmitis may be evident in some cases. Brain imaging should be performed (preferably MRI)
and may reveal evidence of contrast-enhancing lesions (Fig. 5.38). CSF abnormalities are likely
and tend to be quite variable. Typically, a mixed-cell pleocytosis, primarily composed of neutro-
phils and mononuclear cells, with increased protein levels, is apparent. Predominantly mono-
nuclear plcocytosis and normal CSF WBC counts with abnormal cellular distribution have also
been reportcd with protozoal CNS infections.
d.
Clindamycin, or sulfonamides in combination with trimethoprim or pyrimethamine, are recom-
mended for treating suspected or confirmed cases of protozoal meningoencephalitis. Clindamycin
is advised as a frst-choice therapy for toxoplasmosis. A suggested dosage recommendation for
clindamycin is 10 mg/kg per os, every 8 hours, for 24 weeks. Trimethoprim-sulfa can be
tion of sulfonamide (30 mg/kg, q 12 hr, for 2 weeks) and pyrimethamine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg, q
12 hr) for 2 weeks can also be implemented. Pyrimethamine is thought to be morc effective than
trimethoprim against Toxoplasma. Cats may develop myelosuppression while receiving prolonged
(more than 2 weeks) trimethoprim, sulfonamide, and pyrimethamine therapy and may require
folinic or folic acid replacement therapy The prognosis for protozoal meningoencephalitis is
guarded. Dogs and cats may survive if diagnosed and treated early in the course of the
disease.

5. Rickettsial meningoencephalitis197,209,22314351,378.397,404
a.Neurologic dysfunction from rickettsial meningoencephalitis may occur in as many as 43% of
dogs with ehrlichiosis or Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), with the latter disorder being
more commonly diagnosed. The causative agents of these disorders are Ehrlichia canis and
Rickettsia rickettsi, respectively. These organisms are obligate intracellular parasites transmitted to
dogs via the bites of infected ticks. Clinical signs of ncurologic dysfunction may be due to
vasculitis and/or hemorrhage in the CNS. Intracranial hemorrhages may be due to the vasculitis
as well as thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction characteristic of rickettsial disease. Feline
rickettsial meningoencephalitis has not becn reported.
b.Dogs of any age,sex, orbreed can develop rickertsial meningoencephalitisbut German Sh
herd dogs appear to be predisposed to ricketsial infection. There is often a history of potential
or confirmed tick exposure. Onset of neurologic dysfunction is often acute and rapidly progres-
sive. Focal and multifocal signs of encephalopathy may occur. Central vestibular disease is a
common presentation. Clinical signs of systemic illness (e.g., fever, anorexia, lethargy) are
common withrickettsial meningoencephalitis.
C.A tentative diagnosis of rickettsial meningoencephalitis is based on characteristic historical and
clinical signs in a thrombocytopenic patient. Other bloodwork abnormalities may be appreciated,
but thrombocytopeniais themost consistent.Antibodies toEhrlichiacanis andRickettsiarickettsii
can be measured in the serum and/or CSF. There is little cross-reactivity between the two
organisms.A single,markedly elevated serum titer,in association with other supportive data,is
highly suggestive of active rickettsial infection. Demonstration of a rising titer after several weeks
is recommended, especially for RMSF. Appropriate treatment of echrlichiosis may result in a
decreased convalescent titer. CSF titers can be compared with serum titers, as with other infec-
tious diseases. CSF may reveal mainly mononuclear, mainly neutrophilic (suppurative), or a
mixed pleocytosis. Because of the risk of hemorrhage in these patients, the procurcment
of CSF may not be advisable, especially if all other clinical evidence suggests rickettsial disease.
 A positive responsc to therapy also supports the diagnosis of rickettsial
meningoencephalitis
d.Doxycycline, a tetracycline drug, is recommended for rickettsial meningoencephalitis, whether
due to Ehrlichia canis or Rickettsia ricketsi, at an oral dosage of 10 mg/kg, every 12 hours, for 3
weeks.Chloramphenicol is a viable alternative in very young lessthan 6months,but witha
danger of teeth discoloration) dogs, or when doxycycline is ineffective. Enrofoxacin may be
cffective in RMSF cases,but it appears to be ineffective in cases of ehrlichiosis.The prognosis for
dogs with rickettsial meningoencephalitis is guarded to good, depending on the scverity of
neurologic dysfunction and the timeliness of therapeutic intervention.
a.There are several reports describing aberrant parasitic migration to the brain of dogs and cats by
organisms such as Diroflaria irmmitis, Baylisascaris procyonis (raccoon roundworm), Cuterebra,
and Taenia serialis (cystic coenurus formation in cats). Other parasites, such as Ancylostoma,
Toxascaris, and Angiostrongylus also have potential for aberrant migration to the brain. The route
of access to the host for most of these parasites is fecal-oral. In the case of Cuterebra, the small,
first-stage larvae gain access through mucous membrane-lined areas (e.g, the nose) or directly
pcnetrate the skin. These parasites may cause neurologic dysfunction through a variety of mecha-
nisms, including direct tissue damage and vascular compromise from migrating through brain
parenchyma, inciting an intense inflammatory reaction by their presence, and the producing and
releasing of neurotoxic and vasospastic substances. In general, these aberrant migrations are
considered to be rare clinical phenomena. One potential exception is feline cuterebriasis. Recent
data concerning Cuterebra migration in the brains of cats support this disease entity as the cause
of feline ischemic encephalopathy (FIE), as well as a potential cause of other, poorly dcfned,
feline seizure disorders.

b.Although there are no age limits for verminous rneningoencephalitis, it tends to occur in young
to middlc-aged animals that have access to the outdoors. Clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction
tend to be acurc to peracute in onset anid may reflect focal or multifocal encephalopathy. ln cats
with cuterebriasis, asymmetric signs of focal forcbrain dysfunction (e.g., behavior change, sei-
zures, visual defcirs) predominate, bur clinical signs of a multifocal encephalopathy were appar-
ent in 5 of 1l cases. A history of upper rcspiratory disease was also common in these cats,
possibly reflecting thc migration of the parasite through the nasal cavity roward thc cribriform
plate. These cats tend to present with signs of neurologic dysfunction between the months of
July and September. HIyperthermia or hypothermia are common clinical findings in cats with
CNS cuterebriasis. The rate of progression of feline cuterebriasis is not clear fron the recently
reported case series. Other case reports of verminous meningoencephalitis support a rapid
progression of neurologic dysfunction,
Dcfinitive diagnosis of verminous meningoenicephalitis depends upon identification of the
causativc parasite in the brain of an encephalopathic patient. Io date, this has been accomplished
the organism was not found, but other histopathologic
evidence of its presence (parasite track,
gliosis, infarction, laminar cerebrocortical nccrosis) was apparent in the brain. Cuterebra organ-
isms are most commonly locatcd in the olfactory area of the brain in cats. Thc antemortem
diagnosis depends primarily on clinical suspicion. Bloodwork abnormalities are often nonexistent
or nonspccifc. CSF evaluation has been reported in only a few cases; in two of three cats with
CNS cuterebriasis, the CSF was abnormal,
with mononuclear pleocytosis and elevated protein.
One of these two cats had 8% eosinophils in thc CSF WBC differential couint.'Ihe use of
advanced imaging (CT/MR) has been reported in one definirively diagnosed case of feline CNS

is grave. The prognosis for feline cuterebriasis is unknown as antemortern diagnosis is difficult
and reports of definitive treatment of tentatively diagnoscd cases are limited. The recently
reported case scrics was based on retrospecrive evaluation of necropsy cases, so these cases may
refect the most severcly affected cats. Cats with seizure disorders and CSF evidence of nonsup-
purative meningoencephalitis gencrally rcspond favorably for long time periods to trcarmcnt with
anticonvulsants and prednisonc. Cuterebra larvae are thought to be susceptible to ivermcctin, and

intravenous dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) adiministered at the time of ivermectin injection are
fecomimended to prevent or mitigate allergic/anaphylactic reactions to dead or dying larvae. A 2-
week course of prophylactic antibiotic therapy is also recommended to help prevent secondary
bacterial meningoencephalitis. Although not yet reported, surgical renoval of intracranial
Cuterebra in cats may be another viable therapeutic option for feline cuterebriasis-associared
meningoencephalitis, alone or in addition to ivermectiun therapy.

a.There are a number of infectious agents that have been farely reported to cause CNS discasc in
dogs and cats. Included among these are Prototbeca spp. (an algae), Borrelit burgdorferi (the
spirochere responsible for Lyme disease) in dogs, and suspecred scrapie infection in cats in the
United Kingdom (feline spongiform encephalopathy). Prototheca is an environrmenral contami-
nant rhat may invade imrnunocompromised animals. Borrelia is transmitted via Ixodid ticks in
endemic areas (c.g., New England). Felinc spongiform encephaloparhy (FSE) is thought to
develop after cats ingest food contaminatcd with the bovine spongiform cnccphalopathy (BSE)
agent.

A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
b.Because of the paucity of reporred cases, little is known about typical signalment and historical
findings in dogs and cats with CNS protothecosis or borreliosis. Collics may be predisposed to
disscminared protothecosis, and dogs with suspected borreliosis may have a history of tick
cxposurc and/or of having lived in or visited a Iymc-cndemic area. Reports of cats with FSF
have becn primarily limited to the United Kingdorm. Thesc cats tend to start exhibiting clinical
signs of neurologic dysfunction at about 5 years of age. As with other animals infected with
scrapie, a long incubation period is suspected for FSE. Animals with protothecosis and borreliosis
tend to exhibit clinical signs of extraneural disease. Bloody diarrhca and ocular abnormalities
(e.g, chorioretinitis) are frequent findings in disseminated protothecosis, and arthritis involving
one or more limbs is a hallmark of borreliosis. Focal and multifocal/diffusc, progressive encepha-
lopathy can result from protothecosis, borreliosis, and FSE.
c.Antemortem diagnosis of these infectious diseases is uncommon and depends primarily on
historical findings and clinical signs. Prototheca may cause a mixed-cell (neutrophils and lympho.
cytes) CSF pleocytosis. FSE is a noninfammatory disease, and CSF pleocytosis is unlikely CSF
findings in CNS borreliosis are poorly defined. In one dog suspected to have CNS borreliosis,
CSF valucs were within normal limits. Demonstration of CSl antibodies against Borrelia in
excess of those found in thc serum is highly suggestive of CNS borreliosis. Prototheca may be
identified by examining body fuids or tissue aspirates/biopsies and/or by culturing these samples
for the organism. Definitive diagnosis of CNS protothecosis and FSE is typically made at
necropsy.
d. Thcrc is no known effective treatrnent for FSE, and the disease is uniformly fatal. Efforts to
eliminate BSE in the United Kingdom willikcly rcsulr in disappearance of the feline disease.
Although a number of antifungal agents havc bcen advocated to treat disseminared protothecosis,
this disease is typically fatal, despite therapy. Antibiotics such as doxycycline, amoxicilln, and
third-gencration cephalosporins have shown activity against Borrelia, but their efficacy in treating
dogs with. CNS borrcliosis is currcntly unknown.

a.A common idiopathic inflammatory disease of the CNS in dogs (extremely rare in cats), GME is
characterized histologically by perivascular infltrates of primarily mononuclear cells (lympho-
cytes, macrophages, and plasma cells) in the brain and/or spinal cord. The characteristic perivas-
cular celular infltrates of GME both define the discase syndrome and account for the neurologic
deficits. Although the undcrlying cause of this disease remains a mystery, there is cvidence that
GME represents an autoimmune disorder, specifically a dclayed-type (T cell-mediated) hypersen-
sitivity reaction. Lesions predominate in the white matter with GME. Autoantibodies ditected
against astrocytes have been cemonstrated in GME cases, fiurther supporting the suspicion that
this is an autoimmune brain disorder. It remains unclear, however, whcther these anti-astrocytic
antibodies represent a primay or secondary immune response. Recent PCR studies have failed to
detect viral genetic material in brain tissue frorm dogs with GME. There are thrce recognized
clinical forms of GME: focal, multifocal (disseminated), and ocular. The ocular form is the lcast
conimonly encountered. In the author's experience, multifocal GME is the most common form
ofthedisorder.
b. GME can affect any breed of dog of any age and cither sex. However, young to middle-aged
(median age of 5 ycars) femalc dogs of small breeds (c.g., poodles, terriers) appear to be predis-
posed. Clinical signs of either focal or mulifocal CNS dysfunction are possible. Multifocal GME
is characterized by acute onset and rapid progression of CNS dysfunction, whereas dogs with
focal GME tend to have a more insidious onset and slower progression of clinical signs.Whether
alone (focal GME) or in combination (multifocal GME), seizures, cerebellovestibular dysfunc-
and optic neuritis are relatively uncommon clinical presentations of GME. Patients with GME

may occasionally be febrile upon presentation. A group of young (4-18 months old) Greyhounds
from Ireland has been described with a nonsuppurative meningocncephalitis very similar to
GME, but with more gray matter involvement. These dogs exhibited a combination of forebrain
(e.g., circling, blindness) and central vestibular (e.g., head tilt, ataxia) dysfunction.
C.A definitive diagnosis of GME is based upon characteristic histopathologic features of affected
brain and/or spinal cord tissue. Although there are reports of biopsy-confirmed cases of GME in
dogs with focal cerebral lesions, the vast majority of confirmed GME cases have been diagnosed
via necropsy. Antemortem diagnosis of GME is based upon characteristic signalment, historical
and clinical findings, as well as results of diagnostic tests. CSF evaluation usually provides the
mostimportantinformationinthe antemortem diagnosis of GME.Amainlymononuclear
pleocytosis, with a variable percentage of neutrophils (mean of about 20%) and elevated protein
level, is characteristic of GME. Uncommonly (10% or less), GME patients will have primarily
neutrophilic or normal CSF results. Results of imaging studies are highly variable in dogs with
GME. Computed tomography and MR images of the brain in GME patients may be normal,
may show solitary (Fig. 5.39) or multiple (Fig. 5.40) circumscribed mass lesions, or may reveal
areas of contrast enhancement with indistinct margins (Fig. 5.41). In one study evaluating MRI
findings in dogs with intracranial disease and inflammatory CSF results, 24% of cases had brain
images interpreted as normal. Conversely, dogs with multifocal contrast-enhancing brain lesions
consistent with GME and normal CSF results have also been reported. Some dogs with GME
have secondary hydrocephalus evident on CT/MR images of the brain.
d. Immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy (e.g., oral prednisone, 1-2 mg/kg, q 12 hr) has long
been the standard treatment protocol for GME. The dose may be slowly reduced over time if the
lifelong immunosuppressive therapy.Megavoltage radiation therapy has shown some efficacy in
cases of focal GME.
The prognosis for GME remains guarded to poor, but has improved dramatically in recent
years due to new treatment protocols for the disease. In a report of the survival times of GME
focal GME had significantly longer survival times (median of 114 days) than those with multifo-
cal GME (median of 8 days) in that study.Dogs with clinical signs of focal forebrain dysfunction
had the longest survival times (more than 395 days). Due to the variable and often poor response
to glucocorticoid therapy as well as frequent glucocorticoid-related side effects, a number of
immunosuppressive drugs have been evaluated as adjunctive treatment options for GME
patients. The three most promising drug options include procarbazine, cytosine arabinoside, and

cyclosporine. Survival times exceeding 12 months have been reported for each of these three
drugs. In addition, the use of these drugs appears to allow for successive decreases in glucocorti-
coid dosages, thereby minimizing adverse side effects associated with steroid use. Procarbazine is
an antineoplastic drug that crosses the BBB and has some specificity for T cells.The cytotoxic
effects of procarbazine are thought to be primarily via methylation of DNA bases. In one study
of presumptive GME dogs, the use of procarbazine as an adjunct to prednisone was associated
with a median survival time of 14 months, regardless of the clinical form of GME (the majority
were multifocal). The dose used by the author is 25 mg/M² PO, SID. Myelosuppression is the
most likely adverse effect,although hemorrhagic gastroenteritis may also occur.A CBC should
be checked weekly for the first month, then monthly thereafter to monitor for myelosuppression.
Cytosine arabinoside is a synthetic nucleoside analog that crosses the BBB. This drug inserts
itself into DNA molecules after enzymatic activation, causing premature chain termination in
mitotically active cells.The protocol used for dogs with GME is a subcutaneous injection of
50 mg/M, q 12 hr for 2 subsequent days, repeated initially every 3 weeks. The drug should be
diluted 2: 1 with sterile saline (to prevent tissue irritation) prior to injection, and gloves should
be worn when handling cytosine arabinoside. Because myelosuppression is a potential side effect
of this drug, a CBC should be checked weekly for the first month or two, then every 2-3
months thereafter. Myelosuppression appears to be very infrequent with this protocol. In one
case report, a dog with presumptive multifocal GME treated with cytosine arabinoside was alive
and doing well at a 12-month follow-up. In another report of 10 dogs with noninfectious
encephalitis of undetermined etiology, cytosine arabinoside treatment was associated with a
median survival time of approximately 1.5 years. In 2 of these dogs, tertiary treatment (procarba-

zine, leflunomide) was also administered. Anecdotal reports of cytosine arabinoside use in
suspected GME patients concur with the limited published material. Cyclosporine (cyclosporine
A) is a lipophilic peptide that does not readily cross the BBB.Despite this, it is thought that the
drug may become trapped in endothelial cells in the CNS and that the inflammatory nature of
GME may allow more cyclosporine to cross the BBB than would occur in the absence of inflam-
mation. The mode of action of cyclosporine is the blocking of gene transcription in activated T
cells that lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines.There are two clinical reports of
three dogs each describing the use of cyclosporine for presumptive GME. In one report, dogs
were administered a dosage of 3-6 mg/kg body weight PO, q 12 hr; in the other report, the
initial dose was 10 mg/kg body weight PO, q 24 hr. One dog did not respond, and necropsy
confrmed the diagnosis of GME. The other five dogs improved on cyclosporine therapy. Two

tory brain disease in three dogs. I'he dogs responded favorably to leflunomide and were still alive
more than 12 months after starting therapy It was not determined what specifc infammatory
brain disease(s) the dogs had.
9. Necrotizing encephalitis (necrotizing meningoencephalitis, necrotizing
a. This category of noninfectious inflammatory encephalitides includes two pathologically distinct
disorders referred to as necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME) and nccrotizing leukoencephali-
tis (NLE). These are thought to represcnr autoimmune disorders. Autoantibody directed against.
astrocytic antigens has been demonstrated for NME. Both disorders are similar in that they are
characterized by multiple cavitary necrotic nonsuppurative infammatory brain lesions that
involve both gray and white matter. In NME, the lesions are typically found in the cerebrum,
with consistent involvement of the leptomeninges.Extensive ccrcbral cavitations with a loss of
demarcation between gray and white matter are typical for NME. Necrotizing leukoencephalitis
is characterized by similar lesions that often involve the brain stem in addition to cerebrum, with
less consistent involvement of the leptomeninges and cerebral cortex (i.e., mainly whitc matter).
Initial reports of these diseases in predisposed breeds led to the terms Pug encephalitis or Pug/
Maltese encephalitis for NME and Yorksbire terrier encephalitis for NLE.Although Pug and
Maltesc dogs are most commonly affected by NME, other breeds reported with this disordcr
included Chihuahua, Shih Tzu, Pekingese, and Papillon. The author has also encountered a
NME disorder in a Boston Terrier. Yorlkshire Terriers appear to be the most common breed
aflicted by NLE, but this disease may also affect other small-breed dogs. In one report, a Pug
dog and a Maltese dog with lesions more typical of NLE than NME were described. In addition,
in a report of five Chihuahua dogs with NME, two of the five dogs had small lesions in the
medulla, a feature more typical of NLE. In addition, a disorder very similar to NLE was
described in a 20-month-old French Bulldog. It is very possible that NME and NIF represenr
variants of the same disease process. It is expected that more breeds will be reported with idio-
pathic necrotizing encephalitis (NE). As with GME, the necrotic lesions observed on brain
histopathology both account for the clinical signs of dysfunction and define the disease syn-
drome. Although the cause is unknown, the brain lesions are reminiscent of alpha herpesvirus
meningoencephalitis of pcople. However, as with GME, PCR tests have failed to identify viral
DNA associated with thcse disorders.
b. Necrotizing encephalitis tends to occur in young, small-breed dogs, although a wide age range
has been reported. In one report of 36 dogs with NE, the age ranged from 6.7 months to 13
ycars (median, 2.5 years). Clinical signs reflect the distribution of brain lesions. Seizure activity is
frequent with NE, representing the most common clinical cornplaint in one study. Pug and
Maltese dogs with NME have varicd in age at presentation between 6 months and 7 ycars. The
onset and progrcssion of clinical signs of neurologic dysfiunction may be acute (disease course of
2 weeks or less or chronic (disease course of 46 months). Clinical signs of forebrain dysfunc-
tion (seizures, circling, obtundation, visual deficits with normal PLRs, head-pressing, etc.)
predominate. Neck pain is also common and may be due to the meningitis and/or the forebrain
disease.
5/ENCEPHALOPATHIES:DISORDERS OFTHEBRAIN
191
Yorkshire Terriers with NLE have been reported bctwccn the ages of 1 and 10 years. These
dogs typically experience a chronic, progressive worsening of neurologic dysfunction over several
Ionths. In addition to clinical signs of forebrain dysfunction and neck pain, Yorkshire Terriers
with NLE often display clinical signs of brain stem dysfunction (e.g., central vestibular
disease).
In one report,it was found that dogs with NE tend to have clinical onset of disease most
often during the summer months, between May and September.
at necropsy. A tentative diagnosis is based primarily upon signalment, history, and findings of the
neurologic examination. Blood work results are typically normal. CSF findings are often abnor-
mal; most commonly, a predominantly or exclusively mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated
protein levels is evident. The mononuclear cells in NME arc usually primarily lymphocytic,
whereas a mixture of lymphocytes and monocytes is usually seen in the CSF of NLE
patients. In one Maltese dog with NME, one-half of the cells in the CSF differential were
neutrophils.
Computed tomography/MR findings have been described in several cases of NE. Lesions on
MR imaging are usually iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-
weighted and FLAIR images, and inconsistently and nonuniformly contrast enhancing. Asym
metric ventricular dilation and areas of radiolucency in the brain (corresponding with malacic
brain parenchyma), sometimes appearing continuous with the lateral ventricles, are consistent
findings (Fig.5.42).
d. Treatment of suspected NE patients with glucocorticoids and anticonvulsant drugs (if seizuring)
should be attempted, but the drugs often have little to no appreciable clinical effect. The progno-
sis for NE is poor to grave. Although one Yorkshire Terrier with NLE survived for 18 months,
the majority of dogs die or arc cuthanized due to progressive neurologic dysfunction within 6
months of onset of neurologic dysfunction. In the report of 36 dogs with NE, the median
survival time was 1l.5 days. The same drug protocols used in recent years for GME have been
suggested for use in cases of NE. Due to lower case numbers compared with GME, as well as
lack of distinction in some reports between GME and NE, it is unclear whether thcse drugs are
effective for NE or not. In the author's experience, procarbazine does not appear to be as effec-
tive in suspected NE cases as it is with GME cases. The prognosis for this group of disorders
remains poor. The author and colleagues have had anecdotal success treating several suspected
NJ).
a.A rare, idiopathic meningoencephalitis, characterized by cosinophilic pleocytosis of the CSF has
been described in 10 dogs and one cat. No infectious agents were identifed to account for the
meningoencephalitis, and a type I hypersensitivity rcaction is suspected. Eosinophils can release
substances that are directly neurotoxic, which may explain some of the clinical signs of dysfunc-
tion in these patients, as well as the variable response to treatment.
b. The dogs reported with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis varied in age at onset of clinical signs
from 4 months to 5.5 years. Three of the 10 dogs were Golden Retrievers, 2 were Rottweilers,
and 1 was a Rottweiler cross-bred dog. The reported cat (domestic shorthaired breed) was 6 years
old at the time of clinical disease onset.All reported cases weremale.Neurologic dysfunction
developed over one to several weeks in most of the animals, although 1 dog had a 6-month
history of intermittent seizure activity. Nine of the 10 dogs exhibited clinical signs suggesting
forebrain dysfunction (e.g., circling, obtundation, seizure activity). Three of these dogs also had
evidence of brain stem disease (gait deficits, facial paresis, decreased gag refex). One dog demon-
strated cerebellovestibular (head tremors, hypermetric gait, head tilt) and spinal cord (diminished

forebrain andbrain stem dysfunction.
c.The diagnosis of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is based upon demonstrating an eosinophilic
CSF pleocytosis in an encephalopathic patient, with no apparent inciting cause. In people, a CSF
pleocytosis is considered eosinophilic if the eosinophils comprise more than 10% of the WBC
differential. The eosinophil percentage in the reported veterinary cases varied between 55% and
100%. Since histopathologic lesions have been described for only 2 dogs with eosinophilic
meningoencephalitis,thereisno defined histopathologicpattern uponwhich tobasea definitive
diagnosis. Eight of the 10 reported dogs had peripheral eosinophilia evident on a CBC evalua-
tion. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in one case, and loss of signal from the cerebral
cortex area with widened sulci was appreciated.

the cat recovered with glucocorticoid therapy. One of the dogs recovered after treatment with
chloramphenicol, and 1 dog improved with a combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and
prednisone. From this lirnited information, it appears that the prognosis for survival is fair with
eosinophilic meningoencephalitis.
a. A rare form of meningoencephalitis has been described in puppies. This idiopathic disease is
characterized by hydrocephalus and intense infammatory and hemorrhagic lesions in the brain
parenchyma, especially in subependymal locations. Although the etiology of this syndrome is
unknown, a bacterial cause is suspected.
b. This syndrome tends to occur in puppies 2-3 months of age. A wide variety of breeds, including
large-breed dogs, have been reported. Onset of eurologic deficits is acute, and the progression is
typically rapid. Clinical signs of forebrain disease (e.g.
, behavior change, blindness, circling)
predominate, but signs of brain stem dysfunction (e.g., head tilt, ataxic gait) are also ofen
appreciated. Progressive enlargement of the skull may also be appreciated in these puppics.
C.A definitive diagnosis of hydrocephalus with periventricular encephalitis (HPE) is based upon
gross and histopathologic examination of the brain at necropsy. A presumptive diagnosis is based
upon typical signalment, history, and clinical signs, as well as evidence of hydrocephalus.CSF
analysis may reveal a mixed-cell pleocytosis, increased protein, and xanthochromia.
d.The sparse literature pertaining to this disease syndrome is primarily based upon pathology
findings. This appears to bc a rapidly progressive, usually fatal disease. However, in some dogs.
of antibiotic/corticosteroid therapy, with or without surgical shunting for hydrocephalus, should
be considered in puppies with this disease syndrome. The author has reported successful medical
and surgical (i.e., ventriculoperitoneal shunting) management of a suspected HPE case with
external hydrocephalus (Fig. 5.43).
1. It has become apparent in recent years that focal ischemic events to the brain (i.e., infarcts, strokes)
are common occurrences in dogs. The increased availability of MRI in veterinary medicine is the
most likely reason for this realization. There are multiple potential causes for brain infarcts, includ-
ing systenic hypertension (primary/essential hypertension or secondary to an underlying disease such
as chronicrenal failure,hyperadrenocorticism,or pheochromocytoma),cardiac discase,hypercoagula
bility, increased blood viscosity (e.g. polycythemia vera,multiple myeloma), inravasular ncoplasia
(e.g, lymphoma, hemangiosarcoma), infectious disease, and atherosclerosis (e.g, associated with
hypothyroidism, diabetes melitus, or hyperlipidemia). In people with strokes, an underlying cause is
not identified in about 40% of cases; these infarcts are termed cryptogenic. Recent evidence suggests
that the percentage of cryptogenic strokes in dogs is similar to that in people. In contrast to humans,
atherosclerosis appears to be rarely associated with canine brain infarcts; when it does occur in dogs,
it is most likely to be associated with hypothyroidism. Brain infarcts are often categorized in terms of
size (e.g., lacunar, territorial) and whether or not they are associated with appreciable hemorrhage
(i.c., hemorrhagic, non-hernorrhagic). Brain infarcts in dogs are typically non-hemorrhagic and are
most common in the cerehellum, cerebrum, and thalamic/midbrain regions.Multifocal brain infarcts
have been reported, but they are comparatively uncommon. Cerebellar and cerebral infarcts tend to
be territorial, involving the territories of large arteries such as the rostral cerebellar artery and middle
cerebral artery, respectively. These territorial infarcts tend to primarily involve the gray matter, with
variable levels of white matter involvement.Thalamic/midbrain infarcts tend to be smaller lacunar

temic hypertension was documented in nearly 30% of those dogs whose blood pressure was
documented. In another study of cerebellar infarcts in dogs, systemic hypertension was identified in
over 40% of those patients in which blood pressure was measured. In one study, and in the author's
experience, there is usually an underlying disease present that could potentially explain the presence
of hypertension in these dogs, with chronic renal disease and hyperadrenocorticism being the most
common disorders. Global brain ischemia is much less commonly encountered in dogs and cats
compared with focal brain infarcts. Global brain ischemia refers to hypoxia/anoxia experienced by
the entire brain, usually associated with either cardiopulmonary arrest or anesthetic-related
complications.
2. Although the age range for dogs with brain infarcts is wide, the majority are middle-aged to older
dogs, with median and mean ages of 8-9 years. There is some evidence that brachycephalic breeds of
dogs and cats may be predisposed to global brain ischemia, especially when ketamine is used in the
anesthetic protocol. Cerebellar infarcts appear to be most common in small breed dogs, most notably
the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). It has been postulated that this predisposition may be
195
related to this brced's propensity to develop heart discase, inherited platclet abnormalities, or to local
aberrations in rcgional arterial (e.g., basilat artery) blood Aow due to caudal occipital malformation
(COMS), which is common in the breed. In pcople with atlantoaxial instability, basilar artery
compression has been associated with cerchellar infarction. In the author's experience, the combina-
tion of COMS and cerebellar infarct is common in the CKCS, whereas combinations involving
cardiac disease anid platelet abnormalities are nor. Large-breed dogs appear to be predisposcd to
developing lacunar thalarmic/midbrain infarcts. Greyhounds may be predisposed to brain infarcts;
onc proposed reason is thie tendency for Greyhounds to have higher resting mean arterial blood
pressures than other breeds.
vascular evenrs to the hrain. In some cases of focal infarcts, there may be mild transienr paroxysmal
prenonitory signs prior to thc infarct that may represent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). For
example, some dogs with territorial crcbcllar infarcts have had historical complaints of transicnt
vestibular dysfuinction prior ro presentation for the infarct. Also, in some cases, progression of signs
reflective of the area of the brain experiencing the ischemic dainage. Paradoxical vestibular syndrome
appears to be a common phenomenon with cerebelar infarcts. Although nost MR images of
territorial cerebellar infarcs in dogs suggest pure cerebellar involvement of the infarct, the majority
of these patients have signs of medullary dysfunction (e.g., nonambulatory status) as well. This
apparent discrepancy is believed to be explained by secondary medullary compression from the
cdema around the infarcr at the time of the ischemic cvent. By the time the patient is imaged, this
swelling is typically not apparent on the MRI. Another unusual clinical prescntation common in
dogs with thalamic/midbrain infarcts is the prcsence of central vesribular dysfunction, Dogs with
infarcts in this area of the brain have had clinical signs such as ipsilateral head tilt (often in addition
[0 a head turn, which would be expected with a forebrain lesion), strabismus, and nystagmus.
Potential explanations for this unexpected phenomenon include darnage to the thalaimic relay centers
associated with the cerebellum and vestibular nuclei; damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus
(MLF) pathway in the midbrain and/or input of vestibular information to the thalamus (brachium
of caudal colliculus); and the presence of concurrent small medullary and/or cerebellar infarcts that
are not cvident on MR imaging. The author believes that thc vestibular signs are due to the tha-
lamic/midbrain lesions not due to medullary or cerebellar lesions inapparent on MRIs. Because these
aforementioned vestibular pathways associated with the thalarnus and midbrain arc morc concerned
with conscious recognition of balancc, rather than efferent vestibular nuclei input to brain stem
nuclei and LMNs of appendicular muscles (i.e., coordinated execution of gross motor movements),
it may be that the peracute interruption of these typically less imporrant pathways is the key to their
clinical manifestation in stroke victims specifically. In other words, there is likely more time for the
brain to compensate for danage to these less utilitarian vestibular pathways in most other disease
stares (e.g., ncoplasia) than with infarcts. Seizure activity has been reported in dogs with cerehral
infarcts exhibited seizure activity as a presenting complaint; 2 other dogs in this group developed
recurrent seizure activity at a latcr date.
3. Although many cases of brain infarcts in dogs will not have an apparent underlying cause, the
potential presence of such a cause should be investigated both for treatiment and prognostic reasons.
Depending on the particular case, diagnostic tests (in addition to basic bloodwork and urinalysis)
rmay include thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, serial blood pressure measurement, blood
coagulation profile (including measurement of D-dimers and antithrombin IHl levels), endocrine
testing (e.g, ACH stimulation, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, thyroid hormone
profle), and echocardiography. The ideal imaging modality for suspected brain infarcts as well as
suspected global brain ischemia is MR imaging. Computcd tomography may be more sensitive in

detecting acute hemorrhage in early hemorrhagic stroke, but it offers no other advantagcs over MR
imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging allows for greater detail (including detailed multiplanar
images) and fewer artifacts (such as beam-hardening artifact with caudal fossa images) compared
with CT. There are some functional MR imaging techniques (diffusion weighting, perfusion
imaging, and MR angiography) commonly employed in humans that can be used to improve the
few hours). Table 5.3 summarizes the characteristic MRI appearance of non-hemorrhagic brain
infarcts in dogs over time following infarction, using standard MRI sequences. Overall, non-hemor-
rhagic brain infarcts tend to hc hyperintense on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, hypointense on
T1-weighted images, and minimally to non-contrast enhancing (Fig. 5.44). Contrast enhancement,
usually at the periphery of the infarcted region, is typically appreciated 1 to 8 weeks after the
ischemic event, presumably associated with disruption of the BBB. The appearance of hemorrhagic
infarcts on CT and MR images also varies with the time from the ischemic event and is dependent
upon the oxygenation state of hemoglobin. The “aging” stages of hemoglobin molecules progress
scquentially as follows: oxyhemoglobin (peracute stage), deoxyhemoglobin (acute stage),methemo-
globin (subacute stage), and finally hemosiderin and ferritin (chronic stage). Within the first several
hours of a hemorrhagic infarct, the lesion is relatively isointense on Tl- and T2-weighted MRIs but
may show some hyperintensity on T2-weighted images due to edema surrounding the infarct.
Deoxyhemoglobin subsequently forms over the next 24 hours, which is associated with low signal
intensity on T1- and T2-wcighted images. Intracellular methemoglobin predominates next, which is
hyperintense on T1-weighted, but hypointense on T2-wcighrcd images. Subsequent accumulation of
extrtacellular methemoglobin leads to a hyperintense signal on both Tl- and T2-weighted images.
weighted images. Both MRI and CT findings associated with different stages of hemorrhagic infarcts
are summarized in Table 5.4. Hemorrhagic infarcts are also more likely to exhibit contrast enhance-
ment compared with non-hemorrhagic infarcts (Fig. 5.45). With global brain ischemia, there is
usually hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images in the watershed zones of major arteries,
indicating diffuse edema. These regions represent hypoxia-sensitive regions of the brain with the
lowest cerebral perfusion pressure and include the cerebral cortex, basal nuclei, thalamus, hippocam-
gadolinium (T1-weighted with contrast; Fig. 5.46). Cerebrospinal fuid results in nost cascs of
ischemic/vascular encephalopathy are either normal or characterized by nonspecific abnormalities
consistent with a vascular event (e.g., mild neutrophilic or mononuclear pleocytosis, elevated protein
concentration, xanthochromia).
4. Treatment of dogs with ischemic events to the brain is largely supportive. In the acutc stage, manni-
tol should be administered to combat any associated brain swelling and edema. Other specific
trcatments should be directed against any underlying, potential causative disease, if such is identifed.
For example, treatment with enalapril, amlodipine, or a combination of these drugs may be indi-
cated if systemic hypertension is documented.

HEADTRAUMAMANAGEMENT

1.
Introduction15.18.34.5]
Severe head trauma is associated with a high. degree of morbidity and mortality in humans and animals
Death typically results from progressive increases in intracranial pressure (ICP). Brain injury in dogs and
cats is most ofen due to automobile trauma; other causes include missile injuries (e.g, gunshot wounds),
animal bites, and falls. Considerable controversy exists concerning thcrapy for severely brain-injured

Opinions differ concerning what constitutes appropriate therapy for the severely brain-injured pct.
However, few would argue that treatment needs to be expedient and aggrcssive for thc majoriry of these
patients.'The first veterinarian the brain-injured pet encounters after the traumatic incident will likely
dictate the cventual outcome for that patient. Dogs and cats can function well with considerable loss of
agement is to return the paticnt to the role in socicty occupied prior to the injury. It is of utmost impor-
tance to alleviare brain swelling and prevent damage to vital brain stem structures.

Pathophysiology of Head Trauma457,15,18.23.24.29.34,44.51,58
Brain injury can be conceptually divided into primary and secondary injury. Primary brain injury occurs
immediately following impact and iniriates a number of biochemical processes that result in secondary brain
injury. Both primary and secondary brain injury contribute to increased ICP A basic understanding of the
mechanisms of brain tissue damage following injury and ICP dynamics is essential to logical therapy of the
scverely head-traumatized paticnt
A. Primary brain injury
Primary brain injury refers to the physical disruption of intracranial structures that occurs immediately at
the time of the traumatic event. Such injury includes direct damage to brain parenchyma, such as contu-
sions, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injury Damage to blood vessels may result in intracranial hemorrhage
(Fig. 6.1) amd vasogenic edema. Skull fractures can contribute to continued trauma to the brain parenchyma
 e s   o          ss 
of the force of impact. Acceleratory and deceleratory forces of both the impacting object(s) and the intracra-
nial contents will affect overall tissue damage. Direct parenchymal damage associated with primary brain
injury is generally beyond the control of the clinician. However, stabilizarion of skullfractures and evacua-
tion of intracranial hemorrhage may decrease the morbidity associated with these primary injuries.
B. Secondary brain injury
In addition to continued hemorrhage and edema, the daimage caused by the primary brain injury activates a
and subsequent increases in ICP Adeuosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion disrupts the maintenance of
cellular ionic homeostasis. Sudden, uncontrolled intracellular inffux of sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca')

occurs. Cellular swelling (cytotoxic edema) and depolarization result. The uncontrolled depolarization leads
to large amounts of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, to be released into the extracelular environ-
ment. Glutamate causes further increases in intracellular Cat+ levels. Elevated Ca+ levels activate a number
of tissue-damaging pathways, including the arachidonic acid cascade (phospholipase A activation) and the
xanthine oxidase (free radical-producing) pathway. Iron (Fe) is a vital cofactor in the xanthine oxidase
pathway, and free radical species generated via the Fenton reaction (e.g., hydroxyl and superoxide radicals)
are preferentially damaging to cell membranes containing high levels of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) and
cholesterol.Brain tissue is rich in bothFet+ and membranes with high levels of PUFAs and cholesterol.

223
Intraparcnchymal hemorrhage also increases the amount ofFeavailableforperpetuation ofoxidative
damage. Free radical species are thus particularly damaging to ncuronal membranes and probably play a
major role in secondary brain injury Their production is also induced by ischemia, arachidonic acid metab-
olites, catecholamine oxidation, and activated neutrophils. Other secondary autolytic processes induced after
severe head trauma include the complement,kinin, and coagulation/fibrinolytic cascades.Elevated levels of
nitric oxide (NO) and various cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor, interleukins) also contribute to paren-
chymal injury in the damaged brain. Most of the mediators of tissue damage produced by these various
reactions perpetuate their own continued production as well as the production of other mediators. The
maintenance of an ischemic environment perpetuates the above-mentioned processes and also leads to the
accumulation of lactic acid (via anaerobic glycolysis). Lactic acid accumulation leads to further damage to
brain tissue. Hypotension and hypoxemia, extracranial conditions that are common in the traumatized
patient, can worsen brain ischemia and thereby enhance the events rcsponsible for secondary brain injury.
The end result of these secondary processes is increased ICP Unlike primary brain injury, the clinician has
some control over secondary brain injury.
C. Intracranial pressure dynamics
Intracranial pressure is the pressure exerted by tissues and fuids within the cranial vault. Normal ICP values
for dogs and cats range between 5 and 12 mm Hg. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is a primary determi-
nant of cerebral blood fow and hence brain oxygenation and nutritional support. CPP is defined by the
CPP=MABP-ICP
The normal contents of the cranial cavity include brain parenchyma,blood, and cerebrospinal Huid
(CSF). In the healthy animal, these components exist in equilibrium with each other and ICP remains
within normal limits. Between the MABP extremes of 50 and 150 mm Hg, ICP remains constant. This
phenomenon is called pressure autoregulation.Pressure autoregulation serves to link systemic blood pressure
changes to brain vasculature tone.If MABP rises,vasoconstriction occurs in the brain; if MABP falls,
vasodilation occurs in thebrain. In the normal animal, the former scenario prevents ICP from rising by
decreasing cerebral blood fow (CBF), and the latter prevents ICP from falling by increasing CBF. Chemical
autoregulation refers to the direct responsiveness of brain vascularure to the partial pressure of carbon
dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2); elevated PaCO2 levels cause cerebral vasodilation, whereas decreased
PaCO levels cause cerebral vasoconstriction. Both forms of autoregulation often remain intact in people
with a severe head injury, but pressure autoregulation may be compromised in approximately 30% of
patients. In some of these individuals, the lower MABP extreme may become “reset” to a higher value,
resulting in significantly decreased blood fow to the brain with even mild systemic hypotension. With
severehcadtrauma,bothintracranialhemorrhageandedemacan add to thevolume of theintracranial
compartment. Due to the inexpansile nature of the skull, one or more components of the cranial cavity
must accommodate the increased volumc or increased ICP will result. This accommodation orvolume
buffering is accomplished by fuid shifts in the brain vasculature and CSF pathways and is referred to as
Intracranial compliance has limitations and decreases as ICP increases. If intracranial volume increases
beyond the abilities of compensatory mechanisms, then progressively larger increases in ICP result per unit
of volume increase (Fig. 6.3), CPP is compromised, and ischemic death of brain tissue occurs.In cases of
especially in combination with hypoxemia, the brain vasculature will vasodilate in an effort to preserve
blood fow. The increase in blood volume increases ICP, but CPP remains inadequate. In addition, the
secondary autolytic processes occurring in the injured brain are enhanced by hypotension and hypoxemia,
and further brain injury and edema occur with a resultant rise in ICP

Initial physical assessment of the severely brain-injured patient focuses on imminently life-threatening
abnormalities. Many patients suffering severe head trauma present to the clinician in a state of hypovolemic
shock. Do nor be in a rush to focus initially on the patient's neurologic status; it may well improve once the
shock state is corrected. Remember thar traumatized, hypovolemic patienrs with no appreciable brain injury
the ABCs of trauma management (airway, breathing, cardiovascular status). In doing so, the brain will
benefit as well as the rest of the patient. Quick assessment tests (QATs), incltuding packed cll volumc
(PCV), total solids (TS), azostix (AZO), and blood glucose (BG), are part of the initial patient asscssment.
Since hypovoleinia and hypoxemia are strongly correlated with elevated ICP and increased mortality in
human head trauma victims, they need to be addressed immediately.
A.Fluid therapy
There is often concern that aggressive intravenous fuid thcrapy to counteract hypotension in the brain-
injured patient may aggravate brain edema. Therc is both evidence to support and evidence to refue this
concern. Because of this concern, therc havc been recommendations to limit the volume of fuid for victims
of severe head trauma. Such recommendations are not only unfounded but strictly contraindicated. There is
no debate over the disastrous consequences to the injured brain if hypotension is allowed to persist. Hypo-
tension has been repeatedly shown to be a reliable predlictor of sustained elevations of ICP and increased
mortality in human head trauma victims. Blood pressure must be restored to normal levcls as soon as
possiblc. A paticnt with a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg is to be considercd hypotensive. Somc
volume replacement fuids (hetastarch, hypertonic saline) aford somc protection to the edematous brain,
even if used with large volumcs of crystalloids (Jactated Ringer's solurion, O.9% NaCl). Herastarch and
hypertonic saline can improve MABP and thus CPP without exacerbating brain edema. If the patient is
anemic, whole-blood or packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion may assist in maintaining normovolemia
as well as adequate tissue oxygenation by improving blood oxygen content, thc major determinant of which
is hemoglobin concentration. Fluid support may include one or more of the following choices.
1.
 Synthetic colloids: 10-20 ml/kg to effect (up to 40 ml/kg/hr) for shock. This can be given as a rapid
bolus in dogs; give it in 5 ml/kg increments over 5-10 minutes in cats. Hetastarch is the author's
6/ HEAD TRAUMAMANAGEMENT
225
fluid of choice in restoring normal blood pressure in the euhydrated head trauma victim. Dextran-70
is an acceptable alternative, but when given as a sole fuid support, has not exhibited the beneficial
effects demonstrated with hetastarch and hypertonic saline. Dehydrated trauma vicrims should.
reccive isotonic crystalloid resuscitation.
2. Hypertonic saline (7%): 4-5 inl/kg over 3-5 minutes for shock. Hypertonic saline is also availablc as
23.4% solution, which cannot be administered undiluted but may be mixed 1 :3 with hetastarch. or
Sodium does not freely cross thc blood-brain barrier; therefore, hypertonic saline can reduce cerebral
edema via an osnotic pull of fuid out of the brain parenchyma and into the intravascular space. It
also has positive inotropic effects and immunomodulatory effects, and ie reduces endothelial swell-
ing. Although hypertonic saline has been shown to improve MABP and CPP and protect against
increased ICP, sodium has recently been implicated as the major osmotic agent contributing to brai1
edeina. Hypertonic saline may have a global protective effect on the brain, but theorelically it may
lead to increased compromise to focal areas of damaged parcnchyma due to compromise of the
blood-brain barrier in these regions.
3.Isotonic crystalloids (LRS, 0.9% saline): 20-30 ml/kg bolus over 15-20 minutes for shock. The dosc
may be rcpeated as necessary after reassessment. Since overhydration with subsequent worsening of
brain edema and incrcased ICP is a concern with. crystalloid administration, the “shock dose
(90 ml/kg in the dog. 60 ml/kg in the car) of crystalloids should be given incrementally to efflect, as
described above. If the entirc volume is not necessary to restore euvolemia and normal MABl fhid
adininistration shiould be tapered when these physiologic goals arc mct.
4. Blood products: Adminisirarion of 1 rml/kg of pRBCs or 2 ml/kg of wholc hlood will increase the
PCV by 1%. The severity of alieinia will dictate thc total dose to be administcrcd, but 10-15 ml/kg
of pRBCs is a rcasonable starring dose. Blood products are typically administercd over 4 hours, but
they may be given faster (to effect) if the patient is unstable. Boluses of blood products arc accept-
able in the severely anemic trauma patient. Goals of therapy wich blood products are a PCV bctwcen
25% and 30%. Paticnts with demonstrated coagulopathy sliould also be treated with fresh frozen
plasma (FFP) at a dosc of 10-15 ml/kg two to three tirnes per day until coagulopathy has resolved.
B. Oxygenation and hyperventilation
trauma victim can be initially assessed based upon breathing rate and pattern, mucous mcmbrane and
tongue color, and thoracic auscultation. Pneumothorax and pulmonary contusions are common sequelac of
trauma and necd to be addressed, if present. It should be noted that in the face of increased respiratory rate
and cffort, lung sounds may nor consistently be dccrcased on auscultation in patients with pneumothorax. A
rapid, shallow breathing pattern, pale oral mucous membranes, and evidence of respiratory distress should
raise the clinician's index of suspicion for the presence of pneumothorax. Thoracocentesis should be done in
 any trauma patient in whom there is a suspicion of pneumothorax and should be considered a diagnostic
test as well as a therapeutic intervention. If negative pressure cannot be obtained via thoracocentesis, a chest
tube should be placed immediarely. If arterial blood gas analysis is available, the PaO shoud be maintained
at or above 90 mm Hg for dogs and 100 mm Hg for cats. Pulse oximeters are extremely useful and relatively
accurate estimators of oxygenation status.However, the reliability of pulsc oximeters varies with the model
used, with the PaO level (pulse oximerers may overestimatc oxygenation status at lower PaO levels), and
with the patient's hemodynamic status. In general, oxyhemoglobin saturation values (SpO) from pulsc
oximeters should be interpreted as shown in 'Table 6.1.
Patients who are conscious and not obviously dercriorating neurologically should be administered
supplemental oxygcn via face mask, nasal cannulac, nasal oxygen catheter, or transtracheal oxygen catheter.
Facc masks tend to stress dogs and cats and should only be used temporarily, until another form of oxygen
(O) delivery can be instirurcd (e.g-, nasal O). The use of an O2 cage is generally an ineffective method of

administering supplemental O2 to the severely brain-injured patient, as most of these patients require
frequent or constant monitoring. Oxygen cages do not allow for concomitant close patient observation
(requires opening the cage door) and maintenance of a high-oxygen environment. With nasal (Fig. 6.4) and
transtracheal O2 catheters, an inspired oxygen concentration of 40% is provided with fow rates of 100 ml/
kg/min and 50 ml/kg/min, respectively. Oxygen concentrations as high as 95% can be delivered with
proportionally higher fow rates. Nasal O catheters must not be placed farther than the level of the medial
canthus (to avoid entering the cranial vault through a fracture site), and inadvertent jugular vein compres-
sion should be avoided while placing a transtracheal O catheter. High fow rates with nasal O2 catheters
may induce sneezing, which has the potential to raise ICP Patients who are losing or have lost consciousness
should be intubated and ventilated. In the patient with oscillating levels of consciousness or airway obstruc-
tion secondary to trauma, a tracheostomy tube may be indicated for assisted ventilation.Arterial blood gas
measurement is the best way to monitor PaCO levels. End-tidal CO measurement is a useful monitoring
tool, but tends to underestimate the true PaCO levels.Venous CO levels (PvCO2) are also helpful and are
usually less than 5 mm Hg greater than PaCO. However, in patients with perfusion deficits, peripheral
PvCO2 levels can be significantly higher than arterial values and should be interpreted cautiously. Ventila-
tory rates of 10-20 breaths per minute should keep PaCO2 levels between 25 and 35 mm Hg in the absence
of significant pulmonary parenchymal disease. While this has been the recommended range of PaCO2 levels
to prevent cxcessive brain vasodilation, recent evidence suggests the PaCO less than 30 mm Hg may lead to
excessive vasoconstriction with subsequent impairment of CPP. Hyperventilation may be deleterious to
patients whose ICP clevation is not due to hypercarbia-induced dilation of brain vasculature. Indiscriminate

use of hyperventilation to decrease ICP should be avoided, as excessive vasoconstriction of brain vasculature
can decrease CPP.
IV. Secondary Assessment and Diagnostic Procedures,10.15,1,40.69
 Once normovolemia and appropriate oxygenation/ventilation are attained, the patient should be more
carefully assessed for other injuries to the nervous system (e.g., vertebral fractures/luxations), as well as to
other body systems (lungs, abdominal organs, musculoskeletal system). A complete neurologic examination
should be performed at this time. Specific medical therapy for brain injury should begin coincident with the
secondary assessment. Additional blood work, as well as radiographs, may be warranted. Imaging of the
patient's head is often indicated, especially in those animals that fail to respond to aggressive medical
therapy or deteriorate after responding to such therapy. Skull radiographs are unlikely to reveal clinically
useful information in cases of severe head trauma,but on occasion they may reveal evidence of depressed
fractures of the calvaria (Fig. 6.5). Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred modality for imaging the
head in cases of severe brain injury. Computed tomography is prefered over magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging in head trauma cases for several reasons. Computed tomography images are obtained much more
quickly than MR images (MRIs; an important advantage in the critical patient scenario), patients may be
more closely monitored with standard monitoring systems during CT than during MR because of the large
magnetic field required for MR, and acute hemorrhage and bone are better visualized with CT than with
MR imaging (Fig. 6.6).

A number of medical therapies have been recommended for the head trauma victim, most of which are
controversial and not definitively proven to affect outcome. In addition to these treatments, proper physical
therapy and nutritional support are vital to a positive outcome. In the recumbent patient, the head should
brain. This should be accomplished using a slant board that prevents lateral fexion of the neck, which can
impede jugular venous fow.
A.Mannitol (20%-25%)
Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing brain edema and 1CP in cases of
severe brain injury. There are multiple proposed mechanisms of actions by which mannitol decrcases ICP,
including rcfex vasoconstriction of brain vasculature via decreasing blood viscosity, reduction of CSF
production, scavenging free radical species, and osmotically drawing extravascular edema fuid into the
profound effects on ICP is reflex vasoconstriction. This response of the brain vasculature to the decreased
blood viscosity caused by an intravenous mannitol bolus is linked to the brain's pressure autoregulation
mechanism; it allows for improved CPP at a lower brain-blood volume (decreased ICP). The effect of refex
vasoconstriction on ICP occurs within a few minutes, whereas the osmotic action has an effect within 15-
30 minutes. Mannitol's effect on decreasing brain edema lasts berween 2 and 5 hours.
Mannitol is administered intravenously over 10-20 minutes at a dosage of 0.5-1.5 g/kg. Recent evi-
dence in the human literature supports the concept that higher doses of mannitol (1.4 g/kg) arc associated
with better outcomes than lower doses (0.7 g/kg) in patients with severe brain injury; this conccpt, however,
has bcen subsequently challenged by other investigators. Serum osmolality and electrolytes should be
monitored with repeated mannitoluse; osmolality should be maintained at or below320 mOsm/l (to
reduce the risk of renal failure due to renal vasoconstriction), and electrolytes should be kept within normal
limits. It is important to note that measured (by a technique such as freezing point depression), not calcu-
lated,osmolality should be monitored,as the increased osmolality is due to an unmeasured osmol (manni-
tol). Although monitoring measured osmolality and osmolal gap (the difference between measured and
calculated osmolality), and avoiding large changes in either is recommended, a recent retrospecrive study of
95 human patients with head trauma showed that neither was correlated with the development of acutc
renal insuffciency in patients with head trauma, A useful guideline to follow to prevent possible unwanted
side effects of mannitol is to limit administration of mannitol to three boluses in a 24-hour period.
However, due to the conficting evidence in the literature regarding the potential for patients to develop
renal failure secondary to mannitol infusion, the authors recommend that mannitol be aggressively adminis-
tered to those patients with progressive neurologic signs that are responding to it. Since mannirol tends to
through an in-line filter.A frequently raised thcoretical concern about mannitol administration is the
unfounded clinically and should be ignored. Another concern about mannitol use in the head trauma victim
involvcs the concept of “reverse osmotic shift"; with prolonged contact time (multiple doses or continuous
infusions),the extravascular concentration of mannitol in the brain can accumulate and excecd the intravas-
cular concentration.The result of this phenomenon is increased brain edema.With appropriate use of
mannitol, reverse osmotic shift is extremely unlikely to occur. In general, once the head trauma victim is
hemodynamically stable, mannitol should be considered first-line therapy for decreasing ICP and improving
CPP. Although previously proposed as having a synergistic effect on reducing cerebral edema when adminis-
tered with mannitol, recent experimental evidence suggests that furosemide does not reduce cerebral edema
alone or in combination with mannitol. Given that administration of furosemide causes a reduction in
intravascular volume, the authors do not recommend administration of this drug in patients with head
trauna.
6/HEADTRAUMAMANAGEMENT
229
B.Hypertonic saline (7%)
Hypertonic saline is a hyperosmotic solution that may be used as an alternative to mannitol in patients with
head injury. Because sodium does not freely cross the intact blood-brain barrier, hypertonic saline has
similar osmotic effects to mannitol. Other beneficial effects include improved hemodynamic staus via
volume expansion and positive inotropic effects, as well as beneficial vasoregulatory and immunomodulatory
effects.Rebound hypotension is uncommon with hypertonic saline administration because,unlike mannitol,
sodium is actively reabsorbed in the kidneys, especially in hypovolemic patients. This makes it preferable to
mannitol for treating patients with increased ICP and systemic hypotension due to hypovolemia. Combin-
ing hypertonic saline with a synthetic colloid can prolong this volume expansion effect. It is contraindicated
in patients with hyponatremia,as it can cause rapid rises in serum sodium concentrations,leading to central
pontine myelinolysis and delayed neurologic signs. In euvolemic patients with evidence of intracranial
hypertension, both mannitol and hypertonic saline can have beneficial effcts. If an individual patient is not
responding to'one drug, the other may yield a beneficial response.
C. Glucocorticoids
Despite their traditional role in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) trauma, there is little
evidence to support the use of glucocorticoids in victims of severe head trauma.“Standard” dosing protocols
of prednisone and dexamethasone are particularly unlikely to benefit brain-injured patients. Limited experi-
protocol involves the intravenous administration of a 30-mg/kg bolus of methylprednisolone sodium
succinate (Solu-Medrol) at time 0 and 15 mg/kg boluses at 2 hours and 6 hours. The high-dose protocol
was suspected to provide therapeutic benefit via free radical scavcnging action rather than by activation of
steroid receptors. Recent evidence from a large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial
showed significantly increased mortality in people with traumatic brain injury treated with this high-dose
protocol. Givcn the evidence of a detrimental effect in head-injured people and the potential side effects of
these drugs in dogs and cats, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, immunosuppression, and hyperglyce-
mia, the authors do not recommend the use of corticosteroids in patients with head trauma.
Because large doses of glucocorticoids can exacerbate hyperglycemia, the patient's blood glucose should
be checked before administering the high-dose protocol. The increased lactic acid levels cause further brain
damage. There is insufficient evidence to support glucocorticoid use as a standard therapy for head trauma
victins. High-dose methylprednisolone therapy should be considered as adjunctive treatment in non-
measures and mannitol administration.
D.Anticonvulsant therapy
In people, seizures are common after head trauma, with reported incidence rates of up to 54%. Patients
who have at least one seizure after traumatic brain injury have an 86%risk of having additional seizures
within the next 2 years. Post-traumatic seizures are divided into three groups: immediate, occurring within
24 hours of the trauma; early, occurring 24 hours-7 days after trauma; and late, occurring more than 7 days
after trauma.Several controlled clinical trials have been undertaken in human medicine to investigate the
efficacy of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy after head trauma.A meta-analysis showed an overall reduc.
tion in the risk of immediate and carly seizures with prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy (relarive risk [RR]
= 0.3; 95% confidence intervals [C1] = 0.21-0.52), but no effect on risk of late seizures (RR = 1.28; 95%
CI = 0.9-1.8). Given these data, short-term prophylactic therapy for 7 days after trauma may be indicated
in patients with head trauma, and anticonvulsant therapy should always be instituted for all patients with
head trauma who develop immediate or early seizures.However, there is little evidence to support the utility
of long-term anticonvulsant therapy to prevent late seizures in these patients.
E.Miscellaneous therapies
A number of free radical scavenging agents have been investigated for potential use in victims of scvere head
injury. Some examples include lazaroids, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), allopurinol, deferoxamine mesylate,
230
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY

efficacy for these drugs, clinical evidence to support the use of these agents in the head trauma victim is
currently lacking. Similarly, there exists some experimental, yet not clinical, evidence of effcacy for antago-
nists of opiate and glutamate receptors, as well as several calcium channel blockers. Induction of a barbitu-
ratecoma with pentobarbitalhas beenadvocated as a“last-ditch”effort to decrease metabolicdemands of
the injured brain,thereby mitigating effects of ischemia and decreasing ICP.In addition to limited evidence
of clinical efficacy, induction of a barbiturate coma in a brain-injured patient may be detrimental to sur-
vival. Barbiturates may lead to hypotension and/or hypoventilation, both of which will cause increased ICP
Recent experimental and clinical evidence in human head-injured patients supports the induction of
moderatehypothermia(32°C-34°CC,89.6°C-93.2°CF)as ameans todecreaseICPandimprove outcome.
Although traditionally thought to decrease ICPvia decreasing brain metabolic demands, induced hypother-
mia is now thought to provide beneficial results mainly by inhibiting release of inflammatory cytokines and
glutamate. Hyperglycemia (over 200 mg/dl) has been associated with increased mortality in severely head-
injured people. In one veterinary study, the degree of hyperglycemia was found to be correlated with severity
of neurologic dysfunction in brain-injured dogs and cats; however, an association between level of hypergly-
cemia and outcome wasnotfound.It ispostulatedthat theprovision ofextraglucose to theischemicbrain
helps tofuel anaerobic glycolysis, with resultant increases in brain lactic acid. Intensive insulin therapy to
maintain euglycemia in patients with head trauma has recently been proposed; however, a small prospective
clinical trial failed to show an outcome benefit from intensive insulin therapy. Larger clinical trials will be
required to determine the utility of insulin therapy in hyperglycemic patients with head trauma.
In general, indications for surgical intervention are clearly defined in human head trauma management. The
nial hemorrhage. Measurements of focal hemorrhage and accompanying midline shifts of the falx cerebri
from CT images are combined with ICP measurements in making surgical decisions in people with severe
head trauma. Surgical intervention has traditionally played a relatively minor role in canine and feline head
trauma management due to the belief that clinically significant intracranial hemorrhage is rare in these
species. There is some evidence that brain-injured dogs and cats may experience surgically manageable
intracranial hemorrhage, similar to people (Fig. 6.7). With the incrcased availability of CT facilities for dogs
potential indications for surgery in the brain-injured dog or cat include open skull fractures, depressed skull
fractures (with associated neurologic impairment), and retrieval of potentially contaminated bone fragments

or foreign material lodged in brain parenchyma (Fig. 6.8). While surgical removal of focal intracranial
hemorrhage is an accepted and proven aspect of human head trauma management, the use of decompressive
craniectomy in human patients with traumatic brain injury is controversial. A large-scale, randomized
human clinical trial is currently underway (the RESCUEicp trial), which will compare aggressive medical
management with decompressive craniectomy in 500 patients with traumatic brain injury.Until the results
of this trial are available, current recommendations in the human literature are to consider decompressive
craniectomy within 12 hours in patients with sustained, increasing ICP that is refractory to medical therapy.
has been demonstrated,however, that in normal dogs and cats combined craniotomy/durotomy results in
dramatic decreases in ICP. Surgical intervention should be strongly considered in head-traumatized dogs and
cats that are deteriorating neurologically despite aggressive medical therapy.
Medical and surgical decisions based upon ICP measurements, rather than on gross neurologic findings,
have decreased morbidity and mortality in human head trauma victims. In general, recommendations for
human head trauma victims are to maintain ICP below 20 mm Hg and CPP at a minimum of 70 mm Hg.
Prognostic information can also be obtained from ICP measurements. Intracranial pressure monitoring is a
standard procedure for human head trauma management, but has only recently been investigated in dogs
and cats. A fiber optic ICP-monitoring device has been shown to be both technically casy to place and
extremely high cost of the fber optic systcm will likely limit its use in veterinary medicine.An inexpensive,
easily implantable epidural ICP-monitoring system has been evaluated in normal cats; this system was found
to be comparable in accuracy to the fiber optic ICP system.
VII. Prognosis and Complications9,15,17,49,50.65
The overall prognosis for victims of severe head trauma is considered guarded to poor. However, the recu-
many apparently hopeless cases. Predicting the outcome of an individual patient is difficult, but several
factors may assist the clinician in estimating prognosis. These factors include level of consciousness, presence
or absence of brain stem refexes, age and general physical status, and presence and extent of other concur-
rent injuries.A dog or cat that is comatose with absent brain stem refexes from the time of impact is
generally less likely to recover than a patient who is obtunded with intact brain stem function. The

Modified Glasgow Coma Scale (MGCS) scoring system, adapted from a human coma scale, has been shown
in onc rctrospective study to predict survival to 48 hours in dogs with head injury. Table 6.2 describes the
components of the MGCS. The score in each domain is summed, yielding the overall MGCS, which ranges
from 3 (severe neurologic deficits) to 18 (neurologically normal). Table 6.3 provides three categories of coma
scale severity and the suggested prognosis for each. It is the authors opinion that severity of neurologic
deficits at admission is poorly correlated with outcome in most dogs and cats with head injury, especially in
neonatal or juvenile patients. Even patients with severe neurologic signs at admission can show dramatic
improverment in the first 24-48 hours. Trends in neurologic status over the first 48 hours are likcly more
predictive of outcome in these patients than isolated evaluation of neurologic status at a singlc point in
time.The MGCS provides a quantitativc method for monitoring trends in neurologic status over time.
Potential complications associated with brain-injured patients include coagulopathies (e.g., disseminated
intravascular coagulation, or DIC), pneumonia, fuid/electrolytc abnormalities (e.g., central diabetes insipi-

dus), and sepsis. Seizure activity may develop around the time of trauma (suggesting intraparenchymal
hemorrhage) or months to years after trauma (development of a glial scar-seizure focus). Most of these
complications are treatable and/or preventable. Client education is of paramount importance, as persistent
or permanent neurologic deficits in patients with head trauma are common.

Seizures
I,
Introduction
Seizures are the most common neurologic problem in small-animal medicine. Clients are often emotionally
distraught because of the violent,unpredictable nature of seizures.An accurate diagnosis is the first step in
management. The underlying cause of the seizures is identified and treated if possible. In the case of idio-
pathic epilepsy, there is no cure, and managernent usually entails daily administration of medication.
Optimal management of this syndrome depends on the veterinarian and client working together as a team,
with the client actively participating in decisions. With proper treatment, the patient and client can usually
maintain a good quality of life.
11.1
Pathophysiology26,4,80,108,18
An epileptic seizure is the clinical manifestation of excessive and/or hypersynchronous electrical activity in
the cerebral cortex.Brain neurons are inherently excitable. Defects that alter the excitability of a group of
neurons can lead to marked and prolonged depolarization, called a paroxysmal depolarizing shif."This can
involve neurons in a specific region of the brain (leading to a focal scizure) or involve the entire cerebrum
(leading to a generalized seizure). Exccssive depolarization can also spread from a focal hyperexcitable area
(seizure focus) and induce other areas of the brain to seizure.Although the precise mechanisms involved are
incompletely understood, theories include the following:
A. Inadequate neuronal inhibitionmajor inhibitory neurotransmitters include gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) and glycine.
B. Excessive neuronal excitation—major excitatory neurotransinitters include aspartate and glutamate
C. A combination of A and B.
I
A. Primary generalized seizures
Primary generalized seizures are those in which the initial clinical signs refect involvement of both cerebral
hemispheres. Impairment of consciousness is common and may be the initial sign. Motor manifestations are
bilateral. Generalized tonic-clonic scizures, formerly called grand mal seizures, are the most cormmon type of
seizures in dogs and cats.
1.Generalized tonic-clonic seizures
The first part of the seizure is the tonic phase, during which there is sustained contraction of all
muscles.The animal suddenly loses consciousness and fallstoits sidein opisthotonuswiththelimbs
extended. Breathing is often irregular or absent, and cyanosis is common. The patient often salivates,
urinates, or defecates. The tonic phase lasts for a minute or so and then gives way to the clonic
phase, during which there is paddling or rhythmic jerking of the limbs and chewing movements.
The clonic phase lasts a variable period of time but usually no more than several minutes. Some
animals suffer milder generalized tonic-clonic seizures in which consciousness is maintained.
237
238
A PRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
2.Tonic seizures
 During a tonic seizure, the abnormal motor activity consists only of generalized muscle rigidity
without a clonicphase.
3. Clonic seizures
These seizures consist of paddling and jerking with no tonic component.
4. Atonic seizures
These rare seizures are manifested as sudden, often bricf losses of muscle tone. There may be a
5.Myoclonic seizures
These are characterized by brief, shocklike contractions that may be generalized or confined to
individual muscle groups. There are other causes of myoclonic jerks; not all myoclonic jerks are
seizures.
6.Absence seizures
Generalized absence seizures in people are defined as abrupt, brief losses of consciousness
associated with a specific pattern on electroencephalography (EEG). These were formerly called petit-
mal seizures, although this term is often used erroneously by veterinarians to refer to any sort of mild
seizure.True absence seizures are rarely recognized in veterinary medicine.
B.Focal (partial) seizures
Focal scizures are those in which the initial clinical signs indicate abnormal activity in one region of a
cerebral hemisphere. Simple focal scizures do not impair consciousness, which is defined as thc ability to
respond normally to external stimuli, such as sound or touch.When consciousness is impaired,the seizureis
classified as a complex focal seizure. Any portion of the body may be involved during a focal seizure
common.
1. Focal seizures with motor signs
Motor signsincluderhythmic contractions of facial ormasticatory muscles,abnormal move
ments of one limb, and turning the head to one side.
2. Focal seizures with autonomic signs
Autonomic signs include hypersalivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and apparent abdominal pain.
3.Focal seizures with abnormal behavior
Focal seizures in human patients can cause scnsory symptoms such as abnormal skin or vision
sensations. Such subjective sensations are difficult to verify in animals, but seizures manifested as
licking or chewing at a region of the body and *fy-biting” are probably caused by similar sensations.
Complex focal seizures may be manifested as impaired consciousness and bizarre behavior, such as
unprovoked aggression or extreme, irrational fear (psychic or psychomotor seizures). In some cases, it
is difficult to discriminate between a focal seizure and other types of episodes, such as syncope,
narcolepsy, and behavioral disorders.
4. Focal seizure evolving to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure
A focal seizure may progrecss to a generalized motor seizure. The secondary spread can occur so
rapidly that the initial focal component is missed.In fact,in the past,focal seizures were rarely
recognized in animals, but with more detailed history and review of videotaped seizures, it is clear
that many dogs with idiopathic epilepsy suffer focal seizures with secondary generalization.
Occasionally, animals will display episodic involuntary movements of one or more body parts
without an alteration of consciousness. It is unclear in these disorders whether or not the underlying
cause is actually simple focal seizure activity or some other abnormality.English and French Bulldogs
and Boxer dogs tend to display rhythmic side-to-side wobbling of the head (a “no” movement),
whereas Doberman Pinscher dogs tend to have an up-and-down motion (a "yes” movement). This
enigmatic yet innocuous disorder (typically non-progressive) sporadically occurs in other dog breeds
as well. This “head bobber” disorder may represent an abnormality with the stretch mechanism
7/SEIZURESANDNARCOLEPSY
239
involving neck musculature. Other dogs have been reported with episodic repetitive limb move-
ments. These movement disorders may represent simple focal seizures, but some are more similar to
human dyskinesias. Dyskinesias are involuntary movements due to abnormalities of the basal nuclei.
Still another potential cause for these disorders is an abnormality of neuronal ion channels (ion
channelopathies). These movement disorders are discussed in more detail in Chapter 15 (episodic
muscle hypertonicity) as they involve repetitive involuntary contraction of skeletal muscle. There is
the possibility also that the head bobber disorder may also represent a dyskinesia or ion channelopa-
thy.Episodic movement disorders have been described in the following breeds:ScottishTerrier,
Bichon Frise, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Norwich Terrier, Wheaten Terrier, Boxer dog, Chinook
dog, and Border Terrier (Spike disease). Discerning betwcen an involuntary muscle contraction
disorder and focal seizure activity is sometimes based on EEG results and/or response to antiseizure
there is overlap between diseases and underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for those dis-
eases), a positive response to one of these drugs does not necessarily provide a diagnosis of focal
seizure disorder.
IV.Stages of a Seizure10.,26,59,137
A. Prodrome
A prodrome is a long-term indication of a forthcoming seizure. The patient may exhibit abnormal bchavior,
such as restlessness, clinging to the owner, and uncontrolled vocalizing during the hours to days before a
seizure. Prodromes are not always recognized.
B.Aura
An aura is the initial sensation of a seizure before there are observable signs. Auras usually last seconds
to minutes and are caused by the initial abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In other words, the
aura is the start of a seizure. Affected animals may hide, sck their owners, or seem agitated just before a
associated with abnormal EEG activity, while auras are short lasting and caused by abnormal electrical
activity.
C.Ictus
The ictus is the seizure itself.
D. Postictal stage
Postictal signs are transient abnormalities in brain function that are caused by the ictus and appcar when the
ictus has ended.These may include disorientation,restlessness, ataxia,blindness, and deafness.Postictal
abnormalities usually resolve after several minutes,but theymaylast for days,especially after prolonged
seizures.
V.
Epilepsy 10.26,107,137
A. Epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures over a long period of time. From a practical
standpoint, a useful definition is two or more seizures at least 1 month apart. Epilepsy is not a specific
disease; it is a clinical sign.
B.Provoked seizures,also called reactive seizures, are seizures that occur at the time of a systemic
disorder or brain insult.If the seizures stop when the underlying condition resolves,the patient
does not have epilepsy because the condition is not chronic. Seizures caused by acute toxicity are an
example.
240
A PRACTICAL GUIDETO CANINEANDFELINE NEUROLOGY
C. Idiopathic epilepsy, also called primary epilepsy, refers to recurrent seizures in which there is no
identifiable brain abnormality other than seizures.It is likely that most, if not all, idiopathic epilepsies
have a genetic basis.
D.Symptomatic epilepsy, also called secondary epilepsy, refrs to recurrent seizures that are caused by an
identifiable lesion or other specific etiology.
E.Causes of symptomatic epilepsy
Seizures can be caused by a primary lesion of the brain (intracranial disorders) or by a process outside the
brain that affects it (extracranial disorders).
1. Intracranial
Intracranial disorders that may cause seizures include degenerative discases (e.g., storage diseases),
hydrocephalus, neoplasia, infectious/inflamimatory disease (e.g., meningoencephalomyelitis), trauma,
and ischemic/vascular disorders.
2.Extracranial
Extracranial disorders that may cause scizures include hepatic encephalopathy, hypoglycemia,
In general, young animals are prone to infectious diseases, developmental disorders, and storage diseases
Young animals also aremore likely to ingest toxins, such as lead. Older animals are at increased risk of
neoplasia and vascular disorders. Extracranial causes are usually identified by laboratory analysis and histori
cal evidence of toxin exposure. Diagnosis of intracranial disorders usually entails brain imaging and analysis
of cerebrospinal fuid.
VI.Idiopathic piy,222,31,8,9559,6465,,686,2,10,110,11,1,137,141
Idiopathic epilepsy is the most common cause of epilepsy in dogs. Most cats with seizures have an underly-
ing identifiable cause, although idiopathic epilepsy does occur in cats. There are several consistent features of
idiopathic epilepsy in dogs.
A. The age of onset in dogs is usually I5 years of age, but occasionally seizures begin at a young age (less
than 1 year; juvenile epilepsy) or at an older age (late-onset epilepsy).
B.Idiopathic epilepsy is inherited in some breeds, including the Beagle,Belgian Tervuren,Bernese
Mountain Dog, British Alsation, Collie, Dachshund, English Springer Spaniel, Finnish Spitz, Golden
Retriever, Irish Wolfhound, Keeshound, Labrador Retriever, Shetland Sheepdog and Vizsla, but it can
occur in any breed of dog or cat.
C. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal seizures with secondary generalization are the most common
types of seizures, but other types of generalized or focal seizures can occur.
D. Seizures usually occur spontaneously and are more common at night or when the patient is resting or
sleeping.
E. In a few patients, seizures are regularly elicited by a specific stimulus, called epilepsy with reflex seizures.
The most commonly recognized stimuli in dogs are loud noises (typically lawn mower or snowblower
engines) and visits to the veterinary hospital or groomer.
F.Initially, seizures are usually infrequent (every 4 weeks or so), but without therapy or with inadequate
therapy seizures tend to increase in frequency

VII. Diagnostic Evaluation7,73,85,137
A.Differential diagnosis
The diagnostic evaluation is designed to determine if the patient is having seizures, and, if so, the cause of
the seizures. Seizures are recognized by their spontaneous onset, stereotypic signs, self-limiting time course,
and exclusion of common imitators. ldiopathic epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis based on the typical age of
onset, lack of interictal abnormalities, and exclusion of other causes. Symptomatic epilepsy should be
suspected when seizures start before 1 year or after 5 years of age, the patient suffers focal seizures, there is a
sudden onset of multiple seizures, or there are interictal abnormalities detected on history, examination, or
laboratory tests. Several disorders can be mistaken for seizures:
1. Syncope is characterized by partial or complete loss of consciousness, lack of violent motor activity,
short duration and lack of postictal signs.It is often associated with exercise and caused by cardiac or
respiratory disease.
2. Narcolepsy is usually manifested as episodes of flaccid paralysis or loss of consciousness precipitated
by excitement such as feeding, greeting, or play.
3.Myasthenia gravis can cause stiffness, tremor, or wcakness with normal consciousness. Clinical
signs of myasthenia gravis may be induced by exercise. Some myopathies can cause similar clinical
signs.
4. Peripheral vestibular dysfunction is characterized by ataxia, head tilt, and abnormal nystagmus with
no impairment of consciousness.
5.Episodes of encephalopathy can cause disorientation, ataxia, blindness, and abnormal behavior.
Hepatic encephalopathy is an example.
6. Normal or abnormal movements during sleep consist of twitching, paddling, or vocalizing
while the patient is asleep. Waking the animal can interrupt these, and there are no postictal
signs.
7. Behavior disorders, such as stercotypy, can cause specific patterns of bizarre behavior. These episodes
can usually be interrupted, and there are no postictal signs.
8. Pain, especially neck pain, can cause episodes of muscle rigidity or stiffness and crying. Conscious-
ness is not impaired.
B.History
1. A derailed and accurate history is the cornerstone of diagnosis. A description of the seizures should
be elicited from the client, including seizure frequency and duration, as well as if there are any focal
signs at the start of the seizure, such as turning the head to one side or jerking of one limb. In some
cases it heips if the client videotapes the episodes.
2.Ask the client if the events occur at a certain time of day or in association with situations such as
feeding or exercise.
3. Also inquire about any known or suspected familial history of seizures, significant injuries or ill
nesses, vaccination status, diet, and potential exposure to toxins. Clients should be asked whether or
not any interictal abnormalities, such as changes in behavior, gait, appetite, weight, or slecp habits
have been observed.
C. Examination
A thorough physical examination is important to detect signs of systemic illness that might suggest an
underlying cause for the seizures. The clinician should perform a complete neurologic examination to
detect any persistent neurologic deficits. Cerebral lesions often cause focal, relatively subtle deficits
such as delayed proprioceptive positioning on one side or blindness in one visual field. Be careful when
interpreting the neurologic cxamination shortly after a seizure because of the possibility of temporary
postictal deficits. Repeating the examination at a later time may be necessary to determine if any deficits
persist.

D. Laboratory evaluation
1. A CBC and serum chemistry profle are indicated to screen for metabolic causes of seizures.
2. Serum bile acids are tested in young animals to identify porto-systemic shunts.
3. Blood lead determination should be performed in patients with possible exposure to lcad, patients
4. Thyroid function is evaluated in adult dogs because hypothyroidism may complicate seizures and
 phenobarbital can affect thyroid testing.
E.Ancillary diagnostic testing
Cerebrospinal Auid analysis and computed tomography or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are indicated
in dogs with interictal neurologic defcits, seizures refractory to drug therapy, or an onset of seizures at less
than 1 year or greater than 5 years of age. These tests are also indicated in any cat with seizures because
idiopathic epilepsy is less common in this species. Although patients with idiopathic epilepsy characteristi-
cally have normal MR imaging results, transient MRI brain lesions sccondary to seizure activity are occa-
sionally encountered. These lesions tend to be hyperintense on T2-weighted images, do not cause distortion
of surrounding brain parenchyma, and tend to occur in several brain regions (e.g., pyriform, temporal, and
frontal lobes, and the hippocampus). Electroencephalography may be helpful in confirming epileptic activity
when the veterinarian is unsure whether the events are seizures or non-epileptic episodes.
VII.General Aspects of Treatment4,27.37,7,11
The goal of therapy is to reduce the frequency and severity of the seizures to a level that does not substan-
infrequently addressed in the veterinary literature, there is one study of epileptic dogs treated with pheno-
barbital or phenobarbital/bromide combination that determined that epilepsy does have a negative impact
on life span for dogs with the condition. Similar data exist for human epilepsy. The most common reason
for euthanasia in dogs with epilepsy was inadequate seizure control. Serious adverse effects of phenobarbital
and phcnobarbital/bromide treatment were reported as an important contributing factor in the decision to
euthanize in the veterinary study.
Therapy is started once the risks of further seizures outwcigh the risks of treatment. The risks of seizures
include the seizures themselves as well as the emotional effects on the family.The risks of therapy include
drug side effects and the effort and expense of daily medication and monitoring.
Patients with a single seizure, provoked seizures, or isolated seizures separated by long periods of tme
generally do not require treatment. Trcatmcnt is indicated for patients with any episode of unprovoked
status epilepticus (SE), multiple seizurcs in a short period of time, or an underlying, progressive disorder
responsiblc for the seizures. Patients treated early in the course of epilepsy may have better long-term control
of thcir seizures compared to those that have multiple seizures before treatment is started.Establishing an
arbitrary number of “acceptable” seizures per month (e.g., one scizure per month) to apply to epileptics is
not recommended by the authors for several reasons. One reason, already mentioned, is that untreated
once a month will not benefit from this approach. In the authors experience, clients often do not consider
monthly seizure activity an acceptable endpoint of therapy. In one study evaluating owners' perspectives
concerning epileptic dogs treated with phenobarbital and/or bromide, a seizure frequency of lcss than one
seizure every 3 months was perceived as adequate control. A more realistic measure of success of an antisei-
zure drug is a reduction of seizure frequency by at least 50%, with minimal drug side effects. The client
needs to understand the goals of therapy, potential side effcts, and cost and effort associated with treatment
and monitoring.They should appreciate the importance of regular administration of medication and need
to know what to do if a dose is missed (in general, the missed dose is given as soon as the mistake is
recognized, then the next dose is given on schedule). Having the client keep a log of the time, date, and
characteristics of each seizure and any side effects helps in the assessment of therapeutic efficacy.

243
Because of the variability in pharmacokinetics among patients, initial dose recommendations are a
general guide only. ecause of sensitivity to side effects and lack of prior metabolic induction,most new
patients are started at the lower end of the dose range.Autoinduction of metabolism will often require an
increase in dose in the weeks to months after starting therapy. On the other hand, patients with frequent or
severe seizures are often best managed by starting at the higher end of the dose range or using a loading
dose. Once the seizures are controlled, the dose may need to be adjusted downward to minimize side effects.
Any drug used should be given an adequate chance to work and should not be discarded prematurcly.
Antiseizure drugs often must be administered for scvcral weeks or longer before obtaining maximum effects.
Furthermore, it may take several months or more to adequately evaluate seizure control in a patient that has
seizures separated by long periods of time. A common cause of poor seizure control is failure to maximize
the dose before discarding a particular drug. This may lead to the nccd to backtrack at a later date for a
second, more aggressive rial. This can be diffcult,however, because once a client is convinced a particular
drug is ineffective, they are often reluctant to agree to a second trial.
Therapcutic monitoring of serum drug concentrations can be helpful in determining the optimal dose.
Indications for therapeutic monitoring include the following:
A. When steady-state blood levels are reached after starting treatment, changing dose, or immediately after
aloadingdose.
B. When seizures are not controlled despite an apparently adequate dose. This hcips determine the need for
dose adjustment before the drug is changed or a second drug is added.
C. When signs of dose-related toxicity occur, to deterimine if a dose decrease is necessary.
D. Every 6-12 months to verify that changes in pharmacokinetics or compliance have not caused blood
concentrations to drift out of the intended range.
A.Phenobarbitall.32-40
1. One of two first-choice drugs for dogs, phenobarbital is the initial drug of choice for cats. Proposed
mechanisms of actions include increasing neuronal responsivity to GABA, antiglutamate effects, and
decreasing calcium flow into neurons. Phenobarbital is metabolized primarily by the liver.
2. The elimination half-life is 40-90 hours in the dog and approximately 40-50 hours in the cat after
oral administration.Ten to 15 days are required to reach steady-state kinctics.Phenobarbital is a
accelerated administration of itself as well as other hepatically metabolized drugs.
3. The initial dose is 3-5 mg/kg orally q 12 hr in dogs. The range is similar in cats, but a lower initial
dose of 2.5 mg/kg orally q 12 hr is typically administered. After that, the dose is tailored to the
individual patient based on seizure control, side effects, and therapeutic monitoring.
4. Serum levels should be checked 2 weeks after initiating therapy or changing the dose. The target
range is 20-35 ug/ml (85-150 umol/l). Traditionally, it has been recommended to obtain a “trough”
sample immediately before a dose is due. Thcre is no clinically significant impact of the timing of
blood collection (i.e., trough versus peak level) on the serum phenobarbital level measured in the
majority of dogs; however, it is diffcult to identify the minority of dogs in which sample time is
important. Serum separator tubes should be avoided becausc the silicone will bind phenobarbital.
5.Sedation, ataxia, polyuria/polydipsia, and polyphagia are common dose-dependent side effects.
idiosyncratic adverse effect in dogs that necessitates withdrawal of the drug. Superficial necrolytic
dermatitis (SND) is a le-commonly reported side effect associated with phenobarbital use in dogs.
244
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
Unccmmon phenobarbital-associated side effects reported in cats include facial pruritus, generalized
pruritus with distal limb cdcma,thrombocytopenia,and leukopenia.There is one report of a cat
with severe cutaneous eruprions and lymphadenopathy associated with phenobarbital use; the
suspected hypersensitivity reaction resolved shortly after discontinuing phenobarbital therapy.
6.Elcvation of liver enzymes, especially alkaline phosphatasc, is common. This does not necessarily
indicate clinically significant liver disease or the need to stop thcrapy.A common mistake is to
withdrawphenobarbital based only on laboratoryfindings of elevated liverenzyme activity.Therisk
of liver toxicity appears to be greater with blood concentrations higher than 35 ug/ml or when
multiple, potentially hepatotoxic drugs are used. Bile acids may be a better test for hepatotoxicity
and are checked every 6-12months to screenfor liver disease,which is reversible if detected early
and the drug is stopped.
7. Phenobarbital decreases thyroxine (T4) and free thyroxine (fT4) and increases thyroid-stimulating
has no measurable effect on adrenal function tests in dogs.
B. Brom ide14-17,26,3,51,105,106,13,13,140146
1. Bromide is one of the initial drugs of choice for dogs. It is also added to phenobarbital when the
seizures are not adequately controlled despite serum phenobarbital levels of 20-35 ug/ml. The
bromide ion is believed to hyperpolarize neuronal membranes after traversing neuronal chloride
channels. Bromide is renally cxcreted and is the preferred antiseizure drug for dogs with liver disease.
2. Bromide may be effective in some cats, though it appears to be considerably less effective in cats
than in dogs. In addition, berween 35% and 42% of cats taking bromide develop pneumonitis (an
idiosyncratic bronchial asthma-like condition) characterized by coughing and a bronchial pattern on
chest radiographs. These signs typically resolve within 1-2 months of stopping bromide. Because of
questionable effcacy and the potential for severe side effects, bromide is not recommended by the
authors for use in cats.
3. Bromide is administered as potassiurm bromide or sodium bromide in solution or capsules. Use of
the solution is typically less expensive and makes it easier to adjust the dose. There is no difference
in cfficacy for the potassium or sodium salt, although potassium bromide is preferred when sodiurm
intake must be restricted (for example, congestive heart failure). Sodium bromide is preferred when
potassium intake must be restricted (for example, hypoadrenocorticism). Bromicde is not rmanufac-
tured for medical use in North America, but it can be compounded by many pharmacists.
4. The elimination half-life is 24 days in dogs, 11 days in cats. It takes approximately 80-120 days to
reach steady-state kinetics in dogs, 6 weeks in cats.
5. The initial maintenance dose for potasum bromide is 20-35 mg/kg, orally once daily, or divided
twice daily. If sodium bromide is used, the dose should be decreased by 15% (i.e., 17-30 mg/kg) to
account for the higher bromide content of the sodium salt. The dose is subsequently adjusted based
on clinical effects and therapeutic monitoring.
6. A loading dose is used if faster control of seizures is necessary.
a.Twenty-four-hour loading dose
(1) A total dose of 400-600 mg/kg of potassium bromide is administered orally over 24 hours.
(2) This is divided into doses of 100 mg/kg (the lower end of the range) q 6 hr, for a total of
(3) If the patient appears obtunded prior to a dose, skip it and resume when the patient is alert
again.
(4) After loading, begin the regular dose the next day.
(5) This schedule is used in patients that need adequate seizure protection immediately.
(6) The patient should be hospitalized for this loading procedure.
b.Five-day loading dose
(1) Administer 450 mg/kg of potassium bromide over 5 days.
7 / SEIZURESAND NARCOLEPSY
245
(2) I'he daily loading dose (90 mg/kg) is added to the maintenancc daily dose (35 mg/kg) for a
total ural daily dose for each of the 5 days of 125 mg/kg/day. This dosc should bc divided
BID to avoid gastroinrestinal irritation.
(3) On day 6, the maintenance dose is started.
7. A serum bromidc level is checked within 1 week after loading or 3 months after starting a mainte
nance dose. Timing of sample collecrion is unimportant because of the long half-life. The target
range is I--3 mg/ml for paticnts taking bromide alone and 1-2 mg/ml for those taking bromide and
phenobarbital.
8. Bromide competes with chloride for renal elimination. High chloride intake increases bromide
elimination, which increases the dose requirement. Thus, the chloride content of the diet should not
be drastically altered during treatment.
9. Renal insufficiency decreases bromide elimination, so in dogs with persistent isosthenuria or azote-
mia, the initial dose of bromide should be halved and serum bromide concentrations monitored
closely.
10. Whcn adding bromide in dogs taking phenobarbiral, the phenobarbital dose can be gradually
tapered if the scizures are well controlled oncc the serum concenntration of bromide is at least
1.5 mg/ml,
11. Side effects of bromide are usually dose dependent and include pelvic limb stiffness and ataxia,
sedation, vomiting, polydipsia/polyuria, polyphagia, hyperactivity, and pruritic skin rash. Uncom
Pancreatitis has been associared with bromide usc, cither alone or in combination witb. phenobarbi-
tal. Chloridc levcls are often artificially elevated on serum chemistry panel results because some
assays cannot distinguish berween chloride and bromide ions. Anecdotally, the authors have encoun
tered several canine seizure cases in which the dogs developed a persistent cough that seemed to be
associated with bromide thcrapy. Coughing activity resolved shortly after bromide discontinuation in
these dogs. If a bronchial asthma-like condition is a potential side effect of bromide therapy in dogs,
it is likely a comparatively rare development in contrast with cats. Development of a persistent
cough in a dog receiving bromide therapy should alert the clinician to the possibiliry of a bromide-
relared side effect, especially if other diagnostic tests do nor lead to a cause for the cough.
C. Diazepam 14,15,25,3,61,10,137
1.Benzodiazepines are believcd to exert anticonvulsant activity by enhancing GABA effects in the
brain, Benzodiazepines are merabolized primarily by the liver. The short half-life of diazepam in dogs
(24 hours) and development of rolerance limits the use of this drug for maintenance therapy.
Diazepam is used in dogs and cats intravenously or rectally for emergency treatment of seizures.
 2. In cats, diazepam can be used as a maintenance drug (0.5-2.0 mg/kg/day, PO, q 8 or 12 hr). Fatal
hepatic necrosis has been associated with oral diazepam in cats. Liver eiizymes are checked at 1 week
and 1 month after starting therapy.
X.
Second-Line Drugs
Several other drugs are used, typically when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital and
experience, there is no clear consensus on the order in which second-linc drugs should be rricd, but in the
althors' experience, zonisamide and levetiracetam in dogs and lcvetiracetam in cats may offer thc best
combination of efficacy and tolerability in patients refractory to first-line therapy. With additional clinical
experience and controlled trials, some of these drugs may become suitable as first-line therapy, especially as
thcse drugs become less expensivc. In particular, zonisamide appears to work very well in dogs as a first-line
drug (in the authors' experience), with minimal side effecrs. Since zonisamide has become a generic drug.
cost concerns have diminished considcrably.
246
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
A. Clorazepatel4.15.21,37.39,122,137
1. Clorazepate is a benzodiazepine that is sometimes effective when added to phenobarbital and/or
bromide in dogs. Clinical experience in cats is limited.
2. Clorazepate has an elimination half-life between 3 and 6 hours in dogs after oral administration. The
initial dose is 0.5-1.0 mg/kg orally every 8 hours. Sustained-delivery tablets are available but offer no
advantage over regular-release tablets in dogs.
3.Serum levels of the active metabolite (nordiazepam) tend to decrcase with time, so subsequent dose
increases are usually necessary. Long-term use of clorazepate may lead to the development of toler-
ance to antiseizure effects. Hepatotoxicity is also a potential side effect of clorazepate use.
4. Clorazepate often increases phenobarbital concentrations, which can lead to side effects, so pheno-
barbital levels should be closely monitored.
5.In the authors experience, the main indication for oral clorazepate use is as a short-term at-home
treatment for dogs having cluster seizures.
B. Primidone37,124
1.The efficacy of primidone is similar to that of phenobarbital in dogs. However, clinical experience
suggests that primidone carries a greater risk of liver disease compared to phenobarbital. Therefore
there is no reason to use this drug in dogs.
2. Primidone may be toxic to cats.
C. Felbamate23,13,26,34,3,37,3,42,1,1,127,137,151.12
1. Felbamate improves seizure control in some dogs refractory to phenobarbital and bromide. Anecdot-
ally, it also appears to be effective as an antiseizure drug when used alone. There are several proposed
mechanisms of action for felbamate, including interfering with voltage-gated sodium channels,
antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-preferring glutamate receptors, and interfering with the
binding of glycine. Approximately 30% of the oral dose of fclbamate undergoes hepatic metabolism,
the remainder being excreted in the urine.The elimination half-life in dogs is typically between 5
and 6 hours (range: 4-8 hours). Felbamate may also offer some protection to neurons from hypoxic
or ischemic damage. Felbamate is well absorbed after oral administration in adult dogs, but bioavail-
ability in puppies may be only 30% that of adults. The half-life of elimination has also been shown
to be much shorter in puppies than in adult dogs (approximately 2.5 hours). There is no clinical
information available concerning the use of felbamate in cats.
2.The initial dose is 15 mg/kg evcry 8 or 12 hours. This can be increased in 15 mg/kg increments
every 2 wecks until seizures arc controlled, side effects occur, and/or the drug becomes cost-prohibi
tive. Doses as high as 70 mg/kg every 8 hours are required and tolerated well in some dogs. The
toxic dose of felbamate in dogs is 300 mg/kg/day. The reported therapeutic range for felbamate in
people is very broad, ranging from 20 to 100 μg/ml. Because of this factor, the high cost of felb-
amate assays, and the low toxicity potential of felbamate, drug monitoring is usually not pursued.
 3. Side effects are uncommon, and this drug is typically not sedating. Nervousness, hyperexcitability
and decreased appetite can occur at high doses. Felbamatc may increase the risk of liver dysfunction,
especially in dogs taking other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Other side effects atributed to felb-
amate use in dogs include reversible blood dyscrasia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), keratocon-
junctivitis sicca (KCS), and generalized tremors in small-breed dogs (considered to be rare)
4. Caution should be exercised when felbamate is used with other drugs metabolized by the liver,
especially through the cytochrome P-450 system. For example, felbamate may increase plasma levels
ofphenobarbital.
5.Because of the potential for hepatotoxicity, it is recommended that serum biochemistry analysis be
performed every 6months for dogs receiving felbamate, especially if it is given concurrently with
phenobarbital. It may also be advisable to evaluate CBCs every few months in the unlikely event
that blood dyscrasia develops.
7 / SEIZURESAND NARCOLEPSY
247
6.Due to the problems of hepatotoxicity and blood dyscrasias (typically aplastic anemia in people)
occasionally associated with felbamate usc in people, a new derivative of the drugfuorofelb-
amate--has been developed and is undergoing clinical trials for human usc. A reacrive aldehyde
intermediate that is formed during felbamate merabolism has bccn linked to the drugs hepatic and
hematologic side effects. This toxic interinediate is not produced during the metabolism of Auorofel-
bamate. In experimental animal epilepsy models, fuorofelbamate has been shown to have equal or
supcrior anticonvulsant potency in comparison with felbamate.
D.Gabantin1-15,2636,37,39,42597,02,12,3,13
1. Gabapentin, a structural analog of GABA, is sometimes beneficial in dogs with seizures that are
refractory to other drugs. Previously suspected mechanisms of action for gabapentin include
inhibition of voltage-gated neuronal sodium channels and enhancement of the release or actions
of GABA in the brain, Recent evidence supports the main mechanism of action to be through
inhibition of volrage-gated neuronal calcium channels via specific binding of the drug to the 028
subunit of these channels. The inhibition of calcium fow rcduces excitatory neurotransmitter release
(e.g, glutamate, noradrenaline, substance P). Although gabapentin is excreted completely by the
kidneys in pcople, about 30%40% of the dose undergoes hepatic metabolism in dogs. Despite
undergoing some hepatic metabolism in dogs, there does not appear to be any appreciable induction
of hepatic microsomal enzymes in this specics. The elinination half-life for gabapentin in dogs is
3-4 hours.
2.  The recommended dose range for gabapentin in dogs is 25 to 60 mg/kg body weight, divided into
doses administered every 6-8 hours. The authors rccommend an initial dose regimen of 10 mg/kg
body wcight q 8 hr. The suspected therapeutic range for dogs is 4-16 mg/l, but drug monitoring is
seldom pursued for gabapentin.
3. Side effects appear to be uncommon and are typically limited to mild sedation, pelvic limb ataxia,
and incrcased apctite with attendant weight gain.
4. Gabapentin appears to be a moderately effctive antiseizure drug for dogs. In one study evaluating
gabapentin as an add-on drug for dogs with. refractory seizures, there was no significant decrease in
overall seizure frequency over a 4-month evaluation period. Despite this, 3 of 17 dogs were seizure-
free during this tire period, and 4 others had expcrienced a 50% or more decrcase in seizure
frequency. In a similar study of 11 dogs, 5 dogs experienced a 50% or more reductrion of seizures
after starring gabapentin, and there was an overall significant decrease in seizure frequency.
5. Therc cxists only anecdotal information regarding gabapentin use in cats. An oral dose of 5-10 mg/
kg body weight administercd every 8-12 hours has been suggested but is not based on any published
data. To the authors knowledgc, there are no data regarding the safety or effcacy of chronic gabap
entin administration to cats.
6. Pregabalin, a new gabapentin analog (effectively the next generation of gabapentin), has recently
been approved for human use and is commercially available. Pregabalin has an increased affnity for
the 028-subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, compared with gabapcntin, and is purportedly
more effective in people than its predecessor. Kinetic data from normal dogs (unpublished data)
suggest a canine dosage of 24 mg/kg body weight, q 8 hrs, with doses in. the upper end of this
range most likely to keep plasma concentrations within the therapeutic range (reported for hurmans).
It may be possible in some dogs (based on kinetic data) to use a q 12 hr dosing interval for this
drug. Therc is as yet no published clinical information available regarding the efficacy of pregabalin
as an antiseizure drug for dogs. However, preliminary data from a small number of dogs (unpub-
lished data) suggest that pregabalin is an effective add-on drug in some dogs with scizure activity
sse  
that dosing should start at the low end (2 mg/kg) and be increased weekly, as needed, in order to
avoid obvious side effects (e.g., sedation, ataxia).

E.Zonisamide82636.37,3941,283,95,120,5,.48
1.The sulfonamide derivative zonisamide has scveral potential mechanisms of action,including block-
age of T-type calcium and voltage-gated sodium channels and binding to the chloride channel
associated with GABA.
2. Zonisamide is metabolized primarily by hepatic microsomal enzymes and the half-life of elimination
in dogs is approximately 15 hours. In people, it has been shown that the elimination half-life of
zonisamide is dramatically shorter in patients already receiving drugs that stimulate hepatic micro-
somal enzymes (e.g., phenobarbital) as compared with patients who are not receiving such drugs. A
similar phenomenon appears ro occur in dogs also. In a feline pharmacokinetic study (D. Hasegawa,
unpublished data), the half-life of orally administered zonisamide was 34.5 hours.
3.When used as an add-on therapy for dogs alrcady receiving phenobarbital, the recommended dose
regimen is 10 mg/kg PO, q 12 hr. This dosing schedule has been shown to maintain canine serum
70nisamide concentrations within the therapeutic range reported for people (1040 μg/ml) when
used as add-on therapy. For dogs not receiving phenobarbital, it is recomimended to start zonisamide
trations after approximately 1 week of zonisamide treatment.
4. Zonisamide has a high margin of safety and is well tolerated in dogs. Mild side effects (e.g., transient
sedation, ataxia, vomiting) may occur and are more common when the drug is used as an add-on
therapy (about half of the patients will experience some level of side effect).
5. Zonisamide appears to be a very efective add-on antiseizure drug in dogs. In one study, zonisamide
was found to dccrease seizure frequency by at least 50% in 7 of 12 dogs with refractory idiopathic
epilepsy. In this responder group, the mean reduction in seizure frequency was 81.3%. In 6 of the 7
responder dogs, phenobarbital was able to be reduced by an average of 92.2%. In another similar
study, 9 of 11 dogs receiving zonisamide were responders, with a median seizure reduction of
92.9%
6.Zonisamide has been shown to be effective as a sole antiscizure drug in people. Anecdotally,
zonisamide appears to be effective as a sole antiseizure drug in dogs as well In addition, side effects
are typically minimal to absent with zonisamide when used as the sole antiseizure drug in dogs.
7. There are no published data regarding clinical safety or efficacy of zonisamide use in cats. The
authors have treated several cats with zonisarmide as an add-on drug (cats receiving phenobarbital)
with apparent success. In one chronic-dosing pharmacokinetic study in cats (D. Hasegawa, unpub-
lished results), three of six cats dosed orally at 20 mg/kg SID for 9 weeks exhibited somnolence and
ataxia. Further data are needed regarding the clinical use of zonisamide in cats before it can be
recommended for use in this species.
F. Levetiracetam ,9,13,26,3- 39,56.60,627274,79,84,91,12,13,142
1. Levetiracetam is a pyrrolidine-based antiseizure drug. Previously suspected modes of actions include
inhibiting voltage-gated calcium channels and ameliorating allosteric inhibition of GABA and glycine
to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) in the brain. The mechanism of action related to this binding
appears to be related to neuronal calcium fow, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Levetiracetam
has demonstrated neuroprotective properties and may ameliorate seizure-induced brain damage. Thc
drug has also been reported to have an “anti-kindling” effect, which may diminish the likelihood of
increasing seizure frequency over time.
2. The halflife of elmination for levetiracetam in dogs is approximately 4 hours, and the drug is nearly
100% bioavailable following oral dosing (data on file at UCB Pharma Inc., Smyrna, GA). Despite
the short half-life, there is evidence that the anticonvulsant actions of levetiracetam may persist for
some time after serum drug levels have dissipated. Approximately 70%-90% of the drug is elimi-
nated unchanged in the urine, the remainder being hydrolyzed in the serum and other organs. There
is no hepaticmetabolism of levetiracetam, and it is very safe in dogs.Salivation,restlessness,vomit-

ing, and ataxic gait are observed at doses exceeding 400 mg/kg/day. These side effects resolve within
24 hours of drug discontinuation (data on file at UCB Pharma Inc.).
3. At 20 mg/kg, every 8 hours, levetiracetam improves seizure control in some dogs and cats with
epilepsy refractory to other drugs and maintains serum drug concentrations within the therapeutic
range reported for humans. Side effcts at this dose are uncommon, though sedation has been
reported rarely. The effective scrum levetiracetam concentration in people is thought to be between 5
and 45 μg/ml, though the clinical rclevance of this range is somewhat in question. The authors
currently recommend checking serum levetiracetam concentrations in dogs and cats receiving the
drug. In one report of dogs with refractory epilepsy, the use of levetiracetam as an add-on drug
rcsulted in a significant reduction (54%) in seizure frequency, with no apparent side cffccts. In
another report in which the drug was used as add-on therapy in dogs, seizure frequency in the
responder patients initially decreased and subsequently increased over time, suggesting a possible
"honeymoon effect” asociated with leveriracetam use.
4. Levetiracetam is well tolerated and apparently effective in cpileptic cats when used as an adjunct to
phenobarbital. The serum half-life for levetiracetam in cats is about 3 hours. In one report, the
responder rate was 70%, with an average reduction in seizure activity of 92.4%. Two of 12 cats were
transiently (1-2 weeks) lethargic and exhibited inappetcnce after starting oral levetiracetam; these
side effects resolved without changing the dose of levetiracetam.
5.A stcrileinjectable form oflevetiracetam is commercially available.The pharmacokinetics and
tolerability of this form of the drug have been evaluated in normal dogs for both intravenous (IV)
and intramuscular (IM) administration. Intravenous bolus injections of 20-60 mg/kg over 5 minutes
were associated with no obvious side effects and resulted in rapid achievement of plasma levetirace-
tam concentrations within or above the therapeutic range for at least 8 hours. Similarly, IM injection
in dogs had no side effects, had a 100% bioavailability, and achieved drug concentrations within the
therapeutic range shortly after adrministration. Anecdotally, the authors have found the injectable
form of levetiracetam to be very useful in the clinical setting for treating dogs and cats with cluster
seizures and SE.
6.Since the discovery of levetiracetam's unique binding site in the brain, two related antiscizurc
drugs-brivaracetam and seletracetam—with higher affinity for the SV2A receptor than levetirace-
tam have been developed. These drugs appear to have improved antiseizure activity over levetirace-
tam in experimental animal seizure models and are currently being evaluated in human clinical
epilepsy trials.
There are several older drugs used in human patients that are ineffective in dogs, usually because of short
elimination half-lives.These include phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine,valproic acid,and cthosuximide
These drugs are also either known or suspected to be toxic to cats.More recently introduced drugs that have
There are limited data regarding the use of these newer drugs in canine seizure management. However, their
short elimination half-lives in combination with their expense make it unlikely that they will be useful drugs
for the management of seizures in dogs. One study investigating vigabatrin as an add-on therapy in refrac-
tory epileptic dogs found it to be of questionable efficacy; also, 2 of the 14 dogs receiving the drug devel-
oped hemolytic anemia. Lamotrigine has an elimination half-life of only 2-3 hours in dogs and undergoes
significant hepatic metabolism to a potentially cardiotoxic compound. Oxcarbazepine appears to induce its
own hepatic metabolism in dogs, having only a 1 hour elimination half-life after 8 days of repcated oral
dosing. The half-life of tiagabine in dogs is about 2 hours; in addition, this drug has been shown to result in
marked sedation and visual impairment at fairly low doses. The elimination half-life of topiramate in dogs is
 24 hours. None of these newer antiseizure drugs are recommencded for cats, as toxicity data for this species
are nonexistent.

XII. Other Treatments
A. Surgery4
Surgery is an accepted alrernative for hurman patients with certain typcs of refractory epilepsy. Focal cortical
resection is based on using electroencephalography or other techniques to idcntify the region of the cortex
where the seizures originate (the seizure focus) and surgically resecting the focus. Bccause the abiliry to
in dogs with idiopathic cpilcpsy Surgical division of the corpus callosuum is designed to prcvent a seizure
originating in one cerebra! hemisphere from spreading via the corpus callosum to the other hemisphere.
This technique has been used in a small number of dogs with refractory seizures, but long-term results in a
large nunber of dogs have not been reported."s
B. Vagus nerve stimultion26.88.130.136
Electrical stinulation of the vagus nerve by an implantable puise generator, similar to a pacemaker, is an
effective adjunctive therapy for medically refractory focal and generalized seizures in humnan patients. The
mechianism of the antiseizure effects is not complctcly Aunderstood, but. stimulation of afferent fbers in the
vagus nerve probably acts to modify electrical activity in the brain to lcsscn seizure susceptibility. This
techniquc improves scizure control in some dogs with epilepsy poorly controlled with medication.Adverse
ing digital ocular pressure (ocular compression) may have some clinical utility in the emcrgency setting; this
maneuver is believed to provide an anti-epileptic effect via vagal stimulation.
C. Acupuncture6.70.39
Several reports describe acupuncture to treat dogs with epilepsy. Techniques vary, but they include implanta-
tion of gold beads or acupuncture needles at specific locations. Although controlled trials assessing safety
and efficacy are lacling, the use of acupuncture by a veterinarian trained in this technique can be considered
in dogs with mcdically refractory idiopathic epilepsy.
D. Ketogenic diets6.93,96
The beneficial efects of fasting in people with epilepsy have been recognized for centuries. In 1921, Wilder
proposed that the ketosis and acidosis resulting from minimal caloric intake produced an antiseizure effect.
As a result, he introduced a high-fat, low-carbohydrarc, and low-protcin diet that induced a metabolic
condition similar to fasting. T'he ketogenic diet is used primarily in children with medically refractory
are from fat, 6% from carbohydratcs, and 7% from protein. The major drawback is compliance, as the diers
are unpalatable and require precise caculation and close monitoring. It is important to rcalizc that a keto
adding a source of fat to a standard diet does not constieute a ketogenic diet.
A trial of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet (57% fat, 5.8% nitrogen-fre extract, 28% protein) in dogs
with epilepsy failed to show improved seizure control compared to a control diet.
XI Refractory Epilepsy7,16,124.13
Epilepsy is refractory when the patient's quality of life is compromiscd by frequent or severe seizures despite
appropriate drug therapy. Approximately 25% of dogs with epilepsy are believed to be refractory cases. In

treatment errors. Therapeutic monitoring is helpful in identifying low blood concentrations caused by
insufficient dosage or poor compliance. Referral to a neurologist should be considcred if seizures are not
controlled after 3 months of diligent therapy or if thc diagnosis is uncertain.
XIV. Status Epilepticus and Cluster Seizures40,7,82,98-01,10,14,10,9,.132.147
A. Status epilepticus
Status epilepticus is (1) a continuous seizure lasting at least 5 minutes or (2) two or more discrete seizures
without full recovery of consciouisness between seizures. This severe forrn of seizure activity is relatively
frequcnt among dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, but it can occur with seizure disorders of any etiology.
Approximately 60% of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy require admission for emergency treatment of status at
s s r  es s  p e are sppq e d s
activity of 30 minutes or longer may cause systemic dysfunction, including hypoxia, altered blood pressure,
and hyperthermia and can lead to temporary or permanent brain lesions. The most common type of SE is
generalized ronic-clonic status. With a prolonged scizure, the clinical manifestations can eventually bccome
subtle, with only altered mentation and small twitching movements of the face or linbs. This situation is
called clcctromcchanical disassociation and should srill be treated.
B. Cluster seizures
Cluster seizures (serial seizurcs, acute repetitive seizures) arc two ormore scizures occurring over a brief
rence of more than three seizures in a 24-hour period should be considered an emergency condition that
may evolve into SE and should be treated.
C. In-hospital treatment
1. Stop the scizure
a.Administcr diazepam ar 0.5-1.0 mg/kg, IV. Repeat for a total of three doses as necessary to stop
the seizure. Thc duration of antiseizure effects is 30 minutcs or lcss, so a longer-lasting antisei-
zure drug should also be administered (see bclow). Other injectable bcnzodiazcpine drugs have
been suggested for clinical use for the cmergcnt management of canine and feline scizurc
activity, though data are currently limited to pharmacokinetic information. Midazolam has a
rapid onset of action and short elimination half-life after IV or IM administration. This drug
may be more effective and somewhat safer than equivalent doses of diazepam. A recommended
dlose for IV or IM midazolam for dogs and cats is 0.066-0.22 mg/kg body weight. Lorazepam
has more potent activity than diazepam at the benzodiazepine receptor and lasts longer than
diazepam after IV administration. Intravenous lorazepam use has become preferable to IV
diazepam in human ernergency seizure management. In dogs, an IV lorazepam dlose of 0.2 rng/
kg body weight is welltolerated and results in serum drug concentrations within the therapeutic
range reported for people. Both midazolam and lorazepam are wcllabsorbed after intranasal
administration to dogs, but apparently nor with rectal administration. Inrranasal administration
of drugs to a dog during scizure activity carries some risk of being inadvertently bitten by the
paticnt.
b. If thrce doses of diazepam do not stop the seizure, there are several options:
(1) Administer propofol at 1-2 mg/kg, IV. Be prepared to place an endotracheal tube and assist
ventilation. Antiseizure effects can be mainrained with a constant infusion of propofol at
0.1-0.6 mg/kg/min, tirrated to effect.
(2) Administer pentobarbital intravenously at 2-15 mg/kg, IV, over scveral minutcs, to cffcct.
This drug enters the brain slowly, compared with diazepam, so allow several minutes to assess
effects. Endotracheal intubation will be necessary.
252
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
(3) Administer phenobarbital ar 2-6 mg/kg IV, to effect. This inay take even longer to effect
anticonvulsant action (15-20 minutes). However, some prefer this drug becausc it has more
anticonvulsant activity than pentobarbital at doses that do not induce anesthesia.
(4) Induce general anesthesia with isoflurane,
2.Provide supportive care and initiate diagnostic evaluation
a.Administer oxygen, usually by face mask in conscious animals or by endotracheal tube in uncon-
scious patients. Assist ventilation as necessary.
b. Place an intravenous catheter and obtain a blood sample to check glucose, calcium, packed cell
volume, and total solids. Hydration and blood pressure are maintained as necessary with fuid
therapy.
C.Monitor temperature and treat hyperthermia if necessary. Wet towels and a fan are helpful in
cooling patients. Active cooling is stopped once body temperature falls to 104°CF to avoid
hypothermia. Cool water enemas are cffective but make it more diffcult to monitor rectal
temperature.
3.Prevent further seizures
a.Start phenobarbital. Approximately 20 minutes are required for phenobarbital to enter the brain
and exert antiseizure effects. If the seizures have stopped and the animal is conscious enough to
swallow, initiate oral phenobarbital at 3-5 mg/kg, q 812 hr. If the patient cannot swallow or has
a weak gag reflex, administer IM until the animal is awake enough to swallow.
b.Some status/cluster patients may not be conscious enough to swallow orally administered drugs.
Also, some patients may already havc an adequate phenobarbital level at the time of the status/
cluster episode and need to be started on another drug. In thesc situations, intrarectal bromide
can be administered as a loading dose over a 24-hour period. Thc loading schedule for liquid
potassium bromide (KBr) by rectum is 100 mg/kg, q 4 hr, for six doses (total of 600 mg/kg body
weight). The bromide is administered via a syringe and red rubher feding tube. This dosing
schedule will effectively achieve a serum bromide level in the lower end of the target range.
Rectally administered bromide is nearly 100% bioavailable. Side effects of this protocol include
mild sedation and transient diarrhea.
C. Seizure activity may resume. This is common because of the short duration of antiseizure effects
with diazepam.After again stopping the seizure activity, there are several options:
(1) Diazepam infusion at 0.5-2.0 mg/kg/hr in 5% dextrose or 0.9% saline.
(2) Propofol infusion at 6 mg/kg/ht.
(3) Infusions are titrated to effect to control seizures. Blood pressure, body temperature, tissue
oxygenation, and hydration are kept within normal limits.The patient is turned at least cvery
4 hours. Palpate the urinary bladder and express if needed at least three times daily. Thc
patient is kept warm, clean, and dry. Some patients require heavy sedation for 2472 hours
yet will still recover. Overall, about two-thirds of dogs hospitalized for SE recovcr and leave
the hospital.
D.At-hometreatment
seizures that require emergency treatment. The resulting financial and emotional drain on the client
is a common cause of euthanasia.Rectal administration of diazepam by the client is effective in
decreasing the need for emergency veterinary trcatment in these patients.
2. Rectal administration results in higher and earlier peak serum concentrations compared with either
oral or IM routes. T'he client administers I mg/kg diazepam parenteral solution by rectum using a 1l-
inch teat cannula or rubber catheter attached to a syringe. A dose of 2 mg/kg is recommended for
dogs on chronic phenobarbital therapy, which increases benzodiazepine clearance. Treatment is
administered at the first sign of a seizurc and can be repeated for a total of three times within a 24
hour period.
7/SEIZURESANDNARCOLEPSY
253
3. If seizures continue, or the patient appears excessively depressed, the client is instructed to seek
urgent veterinary care.
 4. Some pharmacists can compound diazepam suppositories, and a gel formulation of diazepam
(Diastat) for rectal administration has recently become available for human patients. Howevcr, the
absorption of these products has not been studied in dogs.

Introduction
Narcolepsy is a syndrome characterized by abnormalities in the sleep-wake cycle, including excessive sleepi-
ness and cataplexy. Excessive sleepiness is manifested as waxing and waning drowsines and abrupt onsers of
falling asleep (sleep attacks). Cataplcxy is a brief episode of flaccid paralysis, usually brought on by excite
ment or emotion.

III. Clinical Signs
The onset of signs in familial narcolepsy can occur as early as 4 weeks of age, but in mild cases signs nay
not become apparent until 6 months of age. Sporadic narcolepsy typically occurs in adult dogs. Cataplexy is
usually the most prominent sign. There are several characteristics of cataplexy.
A. Episodes are typically elicited by excitement, such as that caused by food, water, or play, but they can
occur spontaneously.
B. 'T'here is abrupt onset and termination of attacks.
C. The duration varies from a few seconds to 30 minutes or more.
D. There is partial to complete paralysis that may involve all muscles or bc restricred to certain limbs or the
head and trunk.
E.Consciousness is preserved at the onset, but prolongcd episodes can lead to REM sleep.
F.Touching the dog or making loud noises can often terminate an attack.
Excessive sleepiness is recognized in many affected dogs and has several manifestaiions.
A. Prolonged periods of otherwise normal sleep.
B. Difficulty arousing the patient during sleep.
C. Apparent drowsiness throughout the day.

eyelids and often has mild twitching of the face and distal limbs.
IV. Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on the history, clinical signs, and the exclusion of other paroxysmal disorders, such as
V.
‘Treatment
A. Cataplexy is usually trcated with antideprcssants. The tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine,
protryptiline, amitriptylinc) act via blocking cellular norepinephrine reuptake in thc CNS. Imipraminc
also blocks serotonin reuptake, Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Dose
recommendations for these drugs are listed below:
1.  Imipramine (0.4-1.0 mg/kg PO, q 8 or 12 hr)
2. Protryptiline (5-10 mg PO, q 24 hr)
3.Amitriprylinc (1-2 mg/kg PO, q 12 hr)
4. Fluoxetine (1 mg/kg PO, q 24 hr)
B. Excessive sleepiness is usually treated with stimulants. Methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are
syimpathomimetics. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that acts to increase CNS
dopamine levels, Dose recommendations for these drugs are listed below.
1. Methylphenidate (0.25 img/kg PO, q 8 or 12 hr) often improves sleepiness and cataplexy.
2. Dextroamphetamine (5-10 mg PO, q 8 or 12 hr) may help with sleepiness and cataplexy.
3. Sclegiline (1 mg/kg PO, q 24 hr) is also effective for excessive sleepincss, but not for cataplexy.
VI. Prognosis
Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, medication is often effective in minimizing signs. The dose is
titrated to effect. Some dogs improve without treatment.

Functional Neuroanatomy of the Vestibular System20.29,57,72,103
The vestibular system is a component of the nervous system responsible for the maintenance of posture and
balance of the head and body. This system fiunctions in close coordination with the cerebellum, with
portions of the cerebellum providing functions similar to the vestibular nuclei. The components of the
vestibular systerm can be anatomically and functionally divided into those found peripherally (outside of the
brain stem) and those found centrally (within the brain stem and cerebellum). Separation of diseases
affecting these two main areas is important both for differential diagnosis and prognosis in animals with
vestibular system abnormalities.
The vestibulocochlear nerve is the only cranial nerve that does not exit the skull.The sensory neurons
of both the vestibular and the auditory portion of cranial nerve (CN) VIlI are bipolar neurons with cell
bodies located in either the spiral ganglion (auditory) or the vestibular ganglion (vestibular) deep within the
bony labyrinth of the petrous temporal bonc, The dendritic zones of these neurons are in synaptic contact
with specialized hair cells in various receptor organs of the inner car. The “hair” bundles of these specialized
cells are actually stereocilia that function in transforming mechanical deformation (from fuid movement
within the membranous labyrinth) into neural signals.
Three components make up the bony labyrinth within the petrous bone (Fig. 8.1). These include the three
semicircular canals,a vestibule,and thecochlea(which originates in the vestibule).The latter is mportant for
auditory functions. The components communicate with each other and are filled with a fuid resembling
cerebrospinal Auid, known as perilymph.Ihese organs comprise mernbranous structures filled with another
type of fuid, known as endolymph. Collecrively, the organs are called the membranous labyrinth.
The semicircular ducts are locatcd in the semicircular canal and are involved with vestibular function.
The utricle and saccule are also involved with vestibular function and are located within the large vestibule.
The vestibular labyrinths detect either static or kinetic positional signals.
movements of the head. The receptor of the semicircular ducts is the crista ampullaris. Like the macula, the
cupula.As the endolymph in the semicircular canals moves in relation to outside forces, the cupula moves
and deforms the hair cells,which then stirnulate the dendritic endings of sensory neurons of the vestibular
portion of CN VII. The crista ampullaris is a “kinetic"” labyrinth because it senses the position of the head
in any plane and rotational angle.
The static labyrinths are the utricle (utriculus) and saccule (sacculus). The receptor of the utricle and
saccule is known as the macula. The macula is covered by hair cell, which are the actual receptor cells.
otolithic membrane. The otolithic membrane contains otoliths known as statoconia.As the otolithic mem
brane moves relative to gravitational forces, the hair cells are deformed. This generates an action potential
that is propagated through the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). The utricle and
saccule are responsible for localizing the static position of the head in space and in linear acceleration or
deceleration,

Axons from bipolar neurons within the petrous temporal bone (i.e., spiral and vestibular ganglion
neurons) enter the cranial vault through the internal acoustic meatus at the cerebellomedullary angle (rostral
medulla oblongata). The combination of vestibular and auditory axons at this level compose CN VIII.
These axons enter the brain stem at the level of the trapezoid body and caudal cerebellar peduncle.
Vestibular axons enter the brain stem and travel in several different pathways. The majority of the axons
will synapse on the vestibular nuclei. A small number of axons will bypass the vestibular nuclei and ascend
into the cerebellum via the caudal cerebellar peduncle. Some of these axons will synapse on the fastigial
nucleus and some of the axons will ascend into the cerebellar cortex into the ipsilateral flocculonodular lobe.
There are four vestibular nuclei on either side of the brain stem located in the ventrolateral wall of the
fourth ventricle (Fig. 8.2). Axons from these nuclei project to the spinal cord (vestibulospinal tracts) and
rostrally within the brain stem (themedial longitudinal fasciculus,or MLF).Fibers that descend the spinal
cord are found primarily in the vestibulospinal tracts (primarily lateral vestibulospinal tract) and mainly
influence limb extensor tone.The lateral vestibulospinal tract projects from the lateral vestibular nucleus to
all levels of the spinal cord in the ipsilateral ventral funiculus (see Fig. 8.3). These axons will then synapse
on interneurons in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord to mediate facilitation of extensormuscles and
inhibition of fexor muscles on the ipsilateral side.
The MLF travels both rostrally to influence eye position and caudally into the spinal cord. The caudal
or spinal limb of the MLF is sometimes referred to as the medial vestibulospinal tract. The group of axons
that course rostrally will terminate within the nuclei of CNs III,IV, and VI.This circuit influences the

position of the eyes relative to the head in space and is responsible for the oculocephalic reflex. The
oculocephalic reflex is the physiological nystagmus that is generated when the head is moved from side to
side.
Within the spinal cord, the medial vestibulospinal tract, is located in the ipsilateral ventral medial
portion of the ventral funiculus. These fibers, in conjunction with the lateral vestibulospinal tract, are
responsible for maintaining the position of the body and limbs relative to the head.Finally,vestibular
informationis projected to other areas in the brain stem and cerebrum.The vomiting center,located within
thereticular formation of the medulla,will receive afferent input from thevestibular portion of the vestibu-
locochlear nerve. These afferents likely play a role in motion sickness. A final pathway of the vestibular
portion of CN VIlI will ascend to the cerebrum (involving synapse in thalamic relay nuclei) along with
portions of the cochlear nerve to provide a conscious awareness of the body's position in space.

three compartments. The two outside compartments contain perilymph. They are known as the scala
vestibuli and the scala tympani. The middle compartment, known as the scala media or cochlear duct, con-
tains endolymph secreted by the stria vascularis (the vascular endothelium lining one wall of the middle
compartment of the cochlear duct). Between the cochlear duct and the scala vestibuli is the fexible vestibu-
lar membrane (Reissner's membrane). The cochlear duct contains the basilar membrane, along which the
organ of Corti lies. The organ of Corti houses the receptors (hair cells) necessary for audition. The cochlear
duct does not communicate with the outside compartments (scala vestibuli and scala tympani); however, the
outside compartments communicate with one another through an opening at the apex of the cochlea
known as the helicotrema.At the base of the scala vestibuli there is an opening to the middle ear. This
8/DISORDERS OFHEARING AND BALANCE
265
opening is called the oval window or vestibular window (although it has nothing to do with vestibular
function). The three ossicles (Latin for “little bones") are located in the middle ear. The first of these bones,
the mialleus, is attached to thie tympanic membrane.
As thc tympanic membrane vibrates from sound waves in the outer ear, the vibrations are transferred to)
thc mallcus. The malleus is attached to the second ossicle, the incus. The incus is attached to the third
ossicle, the stapcs, which is attached to the oval window. Because ultimatcly the goal will be to move the
Auid in the cocblear duct, and because fuid resists movement much more than does air, the ossicles act as
an amplifier of the sound waves traveling through air fo overcome the increased pressure ncccssary to move
the fluid. 'The muscles of the middle ear, the rensor tympani (innervated by CN V) and the srapedius
(innervated by CN VII) will refexivcly contract in. response to loud noises to dampen rhe activity of the
ossicles and prevent damage to the inner car. Ir is also thought that these muscles are active during vocaliza-
the oval window, pcrilymph in the scala vestibuli rnoves toward thc helicotrcma and deforms the vestibular
mcmbrane. Deformation of the vestibular membrane leads to a deformation of the basilar membranc
secondary to compression of the endolymph within thc cochlear duct. The distance that the compressive
fuid wave travels along the basilar membrane will depend on the frequency of the sound. The basilar
membrane is stiffand narrow at the base of thc cochlear duct and becomes foppy and wide as it extends to
the apex, A high-frequency sound will dissipate quickly at the stiff narrow end of the basilar membrane,

branes than humans and are therefore able to “hear" higher-frequency sounds (such as a dog whistle). The
afea of the basilar membrane that is maximaly deformed by the fuid wave will establish a place code for
that frequency and produce maximal activation of the hair cells sitting atop the basilar membrane. The
deformation of the hair cells will activate the dendrites of the auditory portion of the vestibulocochlear
nerve.
Fibers from the cochlear portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve leave the spiral ganglion and enter the
brain stem at the level of the junction of the medulla oblongata and pons, synapsing in the cochlear
nucleus. From the cochlear nucleus, axons will either ascend the brain stem through the acoustic stria or
cross midline in the trapezoid body (Fig. 8.4). In the medulla they rmay synapse in the dorsal or ventral
trapezoid, and soine will continue on in the lateral lemniscus pathway (pons) to its termination in the
caudal colliculus (midbrain). Efferents from the caudal colliculus will cross midline and descend to brain
stem lower motor neurons as tectobulbar projections to help mediatc brain stem refexes. Some fbers will
join the tcctospinal tract, which originates in the rostral and caudal colliculus and descends to the cervical
spinal cord in the vcentral funiculus. These fibers contain refex information from both visual and auditory
inputs in order to provide refex movements of the hcad and neck in response to auditory and visual stimuli.
The caudal coliculus is involved in reflex auditory finctions. Auditory efferent axons wil project from the
caudal colliculus to the medial geniculatc nucleus in the thalamus to mediate conscious audlitory perception.
'The thalamocortical projections travel from the medial geniculate nucleus in the thalamus through the
internal capsule and into the auditory cortex of the temporal lohe (cercbrum). The projections are prcdomi-
nantly contralateral; however, multiple areas of crossing of the pathways occur, so thc reprcscntation of
sound on each sidc of thc cerebral cortex from the auditory system. is rather diffuse.
IUI.Clinical Evaluation of the Vestibular System5,14,2729,49.5772.75,.107
The vestibular system fiunctions normally to maintain the animal's position in space, This coordinated
activity of sensory input and reffex output is performed at a subconscious level. The maintenance of balance,
posture, and tone contribute to normal equilibrium. The vestibular system is also intimately connected with
the extraocular muscles responsible for reflex ocular moveiments and tracking objects in space. Signs of
vestibular disease are usually manifested as unilateral or asymmetric ataxia. With pure vestibular disease, the
strength of muscle contraction is normal.

Careful observation of the patient in a relaxed environment is very helpful when evaluating an animal
for vestibular dysfunction. Allowing the patient to walk around the examination room and become accus-
tomed to its surroundings may provide the investigator with important clues. Excessive barking or meowing
may be appreciated in deaf dogs and cats. Of primary importance is the differentiation of peripheral from
central vestibular disease. Behavioral changes (fear, aggression) or mental status changes (depression, demen-
tia) are signs that indicate a central lesion. A thorough history along with a complete physical and

neurologic examination are some of the most important diagnostic tools a clinician can have; however,
without an adequate understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the vestibular system, even the most
expertly performed neurologic examination is useless if not interpreted correctly.Additionally, false interpre
tations of a neurologic examination without additional diagnostic tests may lead to the unnecessary cuthana-
siaofanimals.
A.Clinical signs ofvestibular dysfunction
The vestibular apparatus can be thought of as contributing equal, tonic input to each side of the head.
When the vestibular nuclei are excited in the brain stem, there is ipsilateral facilitation of extensors and
contralateral facilitation of fexors in the muscles of the limbs and trunk mediated via the vestibulospinal
tracts. When the system is functioning correctly, the two opposing vestibular systems (left and right) balance
each other out and the body's position in space is maintained at equilibrium. If a lesion prevents the
activationofne sideof theestibular apparatus,then thepsilateralvestibularnucleiwillnotbeexcited s
much as the functioning, contralateral side. The imbalance in the system will cause relative facilitation of
extensors on the normal side and lack of facilitation of extensors on the side of the lesion.Therefore, the
body will be“pushed” by the normal extensors in the direction of the abnormality. This is manifested
clinically as a head tilt, circling, leaning, falling, or rolling to the side of the lesion (Fig. 8.5).
Because the vestibular system also contributes to the generation and maintenance of the oculovestibular
reflexes, abnormalities of movements of the eyes can be very helpful clinically when trying to localize a
lesion. When the head is rotated, the brain will try to keep the eyes focused on the visual field in order to
keep the visual stimulus centered on the retina for optimal visual acuity.To perform this refex activity, there
isvestibular input to the brain stemnuclei of cranial nerves III,IV,and VI.As the head isrotated,the
extraocular muscles opposite the direction of rotation will contract to“pull" the eyes back toward the center
of the desired visual field. Once the muscles reach their limit, the eyes will quickly release and snap back in
the direction of rotation and then again slowly move back toward the center of the visual field. This refex
activity is known as the oculocephalic reflex and represents a form of physiologic nystagmus. Nystagmus is a
rhythmic, involuntary oscillation of the eyes. In the description above, the slow phase of the nystagmus was
opposite the rotation. Nystagmus can have equal movements (no fast or slow phase), which is then referred
nystagmus. Pendular nystagmus is not a sign of vestibular disease. It is often observed in normal Siamese,
Himalayan,and crosses of these breeds as a congenital defect in the visual pathways.When the vestibular

appararus is damaged on one side, there is an imbalance of neural activity in the vestibular nuclei because
the vestibular apparatus on the normal side continues to supply the vestibular nuclei with a constant signal.
This imbalance is “interpreted” by the brain stem as rotation or movement of the body. A nystagmus will be
generated, even though the body and head are stationary, with the slow phase directed toward the side of
the lesion. By convention, the nystagmus is described by reference to the fast phase. A nystagmus can be
characterized by the position the animal is in when the movement is generated and by the actual movement
of the eyeballs themselves. For a postural description, the nystagmus may be spontaneous or positional.
With a spontaneous nystagmus, the movement is present when the animal is in a normal postural position.
With positional nystagmus, the involuntary eye movements are elicited when the animal is placed in an
abnormal position, such as turned on its back or held upside down. The nystagmus may also be described
based on the plane in which the eyeballs are moving. The movements can either be horizontal, vertical, or
rotary. The nature of the movement (horizontal, vertical, or rotary) is dependent on which semicircular
canal is affected. The vertical semicircular canals cancel each other out; therefore, horizontal or rotary
nystagmus is scen with peripheral vestibular disease. Because injury to the peripheral vestibular apparatus
rarely involves one semicircular canal, usually there are components of both rotary and horizontal nystag-
mus, and the character may change between examinations.Finally, nystagmus can be described as either
conjugate, in which case both eyes are moving in the same direction, or dysconjugate, in which each eye is
moving in a different direction.
Strabismus is an abnormal position of the eye. Strabismus is often present in dogs and cats with vestibu-
lar disease. This is usually seen as a deviation of the eye ventrally and laterally on the ipsilateral side (Fig.
8.6). This strabismus may be positional (induced when the head is rotated dorsally) or spontaneous (always
present). In some cases, the strabismus may be induced upon rotation of the head dorsally, and then the eye
slowly rerurns to the normal position of looking straight up at the examiner. This may be sen with careful
observation of both eyes while looking for subtle differences in the position of the globe. This type of
strabismus is not due to paralysis of any of the cranial nerves that innervate the extraocular muscles of
theeye.
Motion sickness is rarely reported in dogs and cats, but probably occurs, especially in cases of acute
vestibular dysfunction. Vomiting and salivation secondary to vestibular disease have been treated with

various medications. Some are thought to have weak anticholinergic activity and therefore decrease the firing
rate of the neurons at the vestibular nuclei.The vomiting center is located within the reticular substance of
the medulla, and there are direct connections from the vestibular nuclei to the vomiting cenrer. It is thought
that by suppressing the activity of the vestibular nuclei, relief from motion sickness may result., Drugs that
have commonly been used are the phenothiazine derivative chlorpromazine (at a dose of 0.2-0.4 mg/kg SQ
q 8 hr in dogs and cats), and the antihistamines diphenhydramine (Benadryl), dimenhydrinate (Drama-
mine), and meclizine (Antivert). A suggcsted dose for diphenhydramine is 2-4 mg/kg PO or IM q 8 hr in
the dog or cat. Dimenhydrinate can be given at 4-8 mg/kg PO, q 8 hr in the dog or cat. There are several
suggested dosing regimens for oral meclizine: the authors recommend 25 mg q 24 hr for medium- to large-
breed dogs and 12.5 mg q 24 hr for smaller dogs and cats. As always, contraindications and adverse side
effects of each drug should be reviewed before administration.
B. Clinical localization of peripheral versus central vestibular disease
There are numerous clinical signs that can help the practitioner in localizing a vestibular lesion. The primary
goal is to decide if the problem is within the peripheral vestibular system or the central (brain) vestibular
system. An accurate history and physical and neurologic examination are essential to success. The first
priority is to determine if vestibular disease is a likely candidate for the animal's presenting signs. A key
component in the diagnosis of central vestibular disease is the presence of neurologic deficits that cannot be
attributed to the peripheral nervous system alone. Seizures, neck pain, tremors, and myasthenia gravis are
often mistaken for vestibular disease. Animals with vestibular dysfunction will usually present with a
primary complaint of head tilt, nystagmus, or ataxia (or combinations of all three). The key to differentia-
tion between peripheral and central vestibular disease is to try and isolate the clinical signsto eitherinvolve
only components of the peripheral vestibular system or include deficits thar could only be explained by a
central (brain) lesion. The deficits that may point the examiner in the direction of central vestibular disease
include cranial nerve deficits (other than CN VII and CN VI), vertical nystagmus, positional nystagmus,
behavioral changes, seizures, and the presence of proprioceptive deficits (Table 8.1). Dogs with central
vestibular disease are significantly more likely to have nonambulatory tetraparesis compared with those with
peripheral vestibular disease. Clinical signs of resting nystagmus and veering or leaning to one side arc
significantly more common in dogs with peripheral vestibular disease.
A head tilt may be present with either peripheral or central vestibular disease. In the case of peripheral
vestibular disease, the head tilt is always toward the side of the lesion.In the case of central vestibular
270
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
disease, the head tilt may be toward or away from the side of the lesion (see discussion below of paradoxical
vestibulardisease).
Nystagmus that is eithcr horizontal or rotary in nature could indicate cither central or peripheral
vestibular disease; however, the presence of a vertical nystagmus is highly suggestive of a central disease
process. With peripheral vestibular disease, the fast phase of the nystagmus is away from the lesion. With
central vestibular disease, the fast phase may be in either direction (toward or away from the lesion). The
nystagmus is usually not positional with peripheral vestibular disease. Because animals are able to compen-
sate rather well for peripheral vestibular disease, the nystagmus may only be present for a few days. With
central lesions, the nystagmus is often positional, and it may change character (for example vcrtical to
rotary) when the head position is altered.Another factor that may help with the differentiation between
central and peripheral vestibular disease is the number of beats per minute (BPM) of resting nystagmus. It
has been found that dogs with a resting nystagmus rate of ≥66 BPM are significantly more likely to have
peripheral vestibular disease (mediai rate = 90 BPM), compared with thosc with central vestibular disease
(median rate = O BPM). Additionally, the longer the clinical signs are present, the slower the rate of resting
nystagmus (inverse correlation). With bilateral peripheral vestibular diseasc, a nystagmus (or head tilt) will
often not be present. These animals will appear as if they are getting ready to collapse. They will walk very
tentatively, with a low, crouched-down stance. Such patients may also display wide, side-to-side head
excursions when ambulating.
The presence of strabismus is more of a “soft finding when trying to differentiate periphcral from
central vestibular disease. With peripheral lesions, the strabismus tends to be ventral or ventrolateral on the
same side as the lesion (ipsilateral). Strabismus is often positional, regardless of whether the causative lesion
is peripheral or central. Extending the patient's neck (moving the head dorsally) often elicits a ventral or
ventrolateral strabismus in patients with vestibular dysfiunction.With a lesion in the central vestibular
system, the strabismus may be deviating in various directions.Dysconjugate strabismus describes deviation
of both eyes but in different directions. This is an uncormmon finding and is usually associated with central
vestibular disease.
The facial nerve (CN VII) enters the internal acoustic meatus of the petrosal bone and courses through
the facial canal to the point where it exits the skull (stylomastoid foramen) dorsal to the tympanic bulla.
Because of its intimate contact with the peripheral vestibular system, disease processes such as otitis may
affect facial nerve function. This may be manifested as complete or partial facial nerve paralysis or spasm.
The sympathetic innervation to the eye also passes in close contact with the structures of the midle and
inner ear. Therefore, the sympathetic system may be affected by peripheral vestibular disease and clinical
signs of ipsilateral Horner's syndrome (ptosis, enophthalmos, miosis, and protrusion of the third eyelid) may
be present. Deficits in facial nerve function or sympathetic innervation to the eye suggest a peripheral lesion,
especially in the face of otitis or trauma to the same side.
The presence of cranial nerve deficits other than the facial or vestibulocochlear nerve is suggestive of a
central problem. Alterations in mental status or level of consciousness may support a diagnosis of central
vestibular disease based on the notion that vestibular projections to the reticular substance in the brain stem
may be affected along with the neighboring ascending reticular activating system. The single strongest sign
of central vestibular diseasc is the presence of conscious proprioceptive deficits. It is common to mistake
ataxia for proprioceptive deficits. Ataxia may be present with both central and peripheral vestibular disease.
Because the proprioceptive pathways do not come into contact with the peripheral vestibular system,
alterations of conscious proprioception are consistent with a central lesion.Portions of the cerebellum add
to themaintenance of sture; thereore,cereellar signs,lng with vestbar igns, suggest eithen
stem and/or cerebellar dysfunction. Clinical signs attribured to the forebrain (e.g., seizures, vision loss,
behavioral changes), along with vestibular signs, suggest a multifocal or diffuse disease process.
Paradoxical vestibular disease refers to lesions of the central vestibular system in which the head tilt is
away from the lesion. The cerebellum normally sends inhibitory efferent projections through the caudal
cerebellar peduncle to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei. If there is a lack of inhibition to the vcstibular nuclei
on the same side as the cerebellar lesion, the vestibular nuclei will be disinhibited,and through a mechanism
8/ DISORDERS OF HEARING AND BALANCE
271
similar to that discussed previously, there will be greater facilitation of the extensors on the ipsilateral side
and facilitation of the contralateral fexors. Therefore, the body will lean away from the side of the lesion,
and the head tilt will be in the opposite direction. In these cases, the fast phase of any resulting nystagmus
will be toward the lesion. In many cases there willalso be asymmetric conscious proprioceptive deficits. The
lesion can be localized to the same side as the worst conscious proprioceptive deficits. Paradoxical vestibular
disease can be seen with lesions of the focculonodular lobes of the cerebellum, the caudal cercbellar pedun-
cles, and the rostral and mcdial vestibular nuclei in the medulla. Occasionally, abnormalities in the dorsal
nerve roots of C1-C3 will producc a paradoxical head tilt, and if present, conscious proprioceptive deficits
will localize the lesion to the most sevcrely affected side.
IV. Clinical Evaluation of the Auditory System29,63.75.98
The ear canals of dogs and cats open within the second weck of life; however, the complcte maturation of
the auditory system does not occur until 6-8 wccks of age. Some estimates have put the maturation date at
4-8 weeks. When assessing hearing in dogs and cats, it is better to err on the conservative side and wait for
tions, is probably not completely matured until 12 weeks of age. The clinical assessment of a suspected deaf
animal can be difficult. Bearing this in mind, it is importanr to remember that all animals may react to
vibratory clues (slamrming a book on a table or shutting a door) or visual cues (clapping hands). Therefore,
one should endeavor to stay out of the animal's visual field when trying to elicit an auditory perceived
response. Complete hearing loss can be a challenge to assess clinically, and partial or unilateral hearing Ioss
is cevcn morc difficult to ascertain. Central deafness, or deafness duc to an abnorimality in the brain stem
without concomitant sigas of diffuse neurological diseasc, is rare. Because therc are multiple points along
the auditory pathways from the cochlear nuclei to the thalamus that cross, the auditory pathways are well
represented bilaterally within the brain stem. It would therefore take a severe injury or disease process in
order to completely disrupt auditory funcrion. A process of that degree would certainly manifest itself with
other signs of severe brain stem disease. Therefore, complete bilateral deafness is usually caused by an
abnormality with the auditory receptor (the organ or Corti) and more specifically with the hair cells thenm
selves. 'T'he history and signalinent of an animal suspected of having auditory dysfunction is very important.
Especially pertinent are the breed of the dog and the age of onset when thc owner frst suspected a problcm.
This may help differentiate congenital deafness from acquired deafness, which may affect breeding pro-
grams.Oher signs ofncurologic disease, especially vestibular disease, are important to document, as well as
any history of trauma to the head or ears, use of potentially ototoxic drugs or compounds, and any previous
or current clinical signs of irritation (such as head shaking, odor, or exudates from the external ear canal).
'There are rwo types of deafness in dogs and cats: conduction deafness and sensorineural deafness.
A.Conduction deafness
When the middlc or cxternal ear is responsible for hearing loss, such loss is due to a problem with the
actual conduction or transmission of the sound wavcs from the external environment to the cochlea.
Blockage of sound wave transmission may bc due to occlusion of the external ear canal by ceruminous
debris, tissue, or foreign bodies. These blockages may be congenital, as in the case of birth defects, or
 or exudate, excessive tissue growth, foreign body, malformation of or darmage to the ossicles, and stiffening
of the ossicles with age.
B. Sensorineural deafness
If the inner car auditory structures or auditory pathways are compromiscd, scnsorineural deafncss may
result. Abnormalities of the cochlea, cochlear portion of thc vestibulocochlear nervc, auditory pathways in
the brain, thalamus, and crebrum all have the potential to lead to a blockage of the auditory signal trans-
mission and subsequent dcafncs. In all practicality, almost all cases of pure sensorineural deafness are due to
272
a functional problem with the hair cells of the organ of Corti. There are no degenerative, congenital, or
acquired conditions that specifically target the auditory pathways and projections in the brain.
V.
Diseases Affecting the Peripheral Vestibular System5.8.10,4,1729.31.364047515456.58.61,6869,72.87.8.95.101.303,109.16
A.Degenerative/anomalous
Peripheral vestibular disease may be evident in young animals and attributed to a congenital malformation
or degeneration of the inner ear structures. If the abnormality is bilateral, these animals may not have a
head tilt or nystagmus; however, they willfrequently have a symmetrical ataxia, a wide-based stance, and a
side-to-side movement of the hcad in the horizontal plane. The vestibular disease may be prescnt in associa-
tion with deafness. The clinical signs will usually present when the animals begin to ambulate. They may
consist of head tilt, nystagmus, strabismus, ataxia, circling, falling,rolling, and abnormal head movements.
Clinical signs associated with the vestibular disease may resolve; however, a head tilt or head tilt that shifts
from side to side may persist. Many of the reported animals with this congenital peripheral vestibular
disease will compensate for the abnormalities in balance. It is thought that any compensation is centrally
mediated, likely through visual mechanisms. If the animal is deaf, the hearing abnormality is pcrmanent.
The abnormality has been known to affect German Shepherds, English Cocker Spaniels, Doberman Pin-
schers, as well as Siamese and Burmesc cats. In a report of Doberman Pinscher puppies affected from
multiple litters from the same dam, a lymphocytic labyrinthitis was discovered on histological examination.
An in utero viral infection was hypothesized to cause the degeneration. No other.abnormalities have been
documented in affected animals. There is no treatment for the condition.
B. Metabolic
Hypothyroid-associated neurological dysfunction is well recognized. Specific involvement of the peripheral
vestibular system may be the primary presenting clinical cornplaint. It is usually seen in oldcr animals as an
acute onset, non-progressive presentation. Nearly all animals will have a head tilt and positional strabismus.
Many animals also have decreased mcnace responses and decreascd palpebral reflexes. More obvious signs of
facial ncrvc paralysis may also be present. Other clinical signs may be an abnormal gait and circling. Brain
stem auditory evoked response testing may be abnormal. There may be other clinical and clinicopathological
signs of hypothyroidism (hypercholesterolemia, abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone response). Other
potential causes of vestibular disease must be ruled out, paying special attention to posble structural
disease. Because the clinical signs associated with this disease may suggest central vestibular diseasc, thc
clinician should be certain a poor prognosis is not given to the owners of the animal without first evaluating
and ruling out the possibility of hypothyroidism. The diagnosis may be challenging in that many animals
are mistakenly thought to have euthyroid sick syndrome. With adequate supplementation of levothyroxine,
the majority of these animals will return to normal.
C. Neoplastic
Neoplastic processes affecting the peripheral nervous system may result in peripheral vestibular disease by
compression or invasion of the vestibulocochlear nerve. Peripheral nerve tumors (i.e., schwannomas) may
initially present as peripheral vestibular dysfunction; however, with time they can invade the brain stem.
Tumors of the ear (e.g, ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma) may invade the middle and inner ear and cause
vestibular disturbances. Other tumors such as chondrosarcoma, ostcosarcoma, fbrosarcoma, and squamous
cell carcinoma have the potential to invade adjacent tissue, resulting in vestibular disease. Treatment is
directed at the primary lesion. Supportive treatment for vestibular dysfunction may also be necesary.
D. Idiopathic
A condition of idiopathic vestibular disease is wellrecognized in dogs and cats. Cats of any age can be
affected. Dogs tend to be older, and therefore the disease is often referred to as idiopatbic geriatric vestibular
disease.Thiese vestibular episodes are often confused with vascular accidents (“strokes") or seizures. The key
8/DISORDERSOFHEARINGANDBALANCE
273
to this diagnosis is the absence ofany detectable structural,metabolic,orinfammatory discase,as well as
lack of evidence of central disease. The onset is acute or peracute, and animals may present with. signs of
dysfunction ranging from a mild head tilt to severe imbalance and rolling. The clinical signs are usually
unilateral, with a horizontal or rotary nystagmus (fast phase away from the side of the head tilt) and an
asymmetrical ataxia. The ataxia may be confused with proprioceptive deficits. Animals with idiopathic
vestibular disease maintain their strength and mental status. The vestibular signs can be so severe that the
affected animals are often incapacitated,making the initial neurologic exam difficult, especially in cats.Most
animals will improve rapidly, although complete recovery may take 2-3 weeks in a typical case. Improve-
ment is often appreciated within the first 72 hours. In some animals, clinical signs may persist for up to 5
weeks.Oasionally, amildhead tilt will persist aferotherclinical signshave resolved.Theconditioncan
be relapsing. It is thought that this syndrome may result from abnormalities with the endolymphatic fuid of
the inner car structures, a mild intoxication of the vestibular system, or autoimmune disease. There is no
specific treatment for the disease. The use of corticosteroids has not resulted in more rapid clinical improve-
ment. Care should be directed at supportive treatment, which may include sedatives, and therapy directed at
relieving motion sickness. There is debate as to whether or not central signs (such as proprioceptive deficits)
may be present with this clinical syndrome. Occasionally, in geriatric dogs with this disorder, pelvic limb
conscious proprioceptive deficits will be demonstrated on neurologic examination. In many of these cases,
the placing deficits are suspected to be duc to chronic, subclinical disk protrusions unrelated to the vestibu-
lar disordcr. However, until there is substantial improvement in vestibular function, or cenrral nervous
system (CNS) disease is ruled out, pelvic limb conscious proprioceptive deficits should be considcred
potential evidence of a central vestibular disorder.
E.Inflammatory/infectious
The most common cause of peripheral vestibular disease in dogs and cats is otitis media/interna. It has been
associated with approximately 50% of the cases of peripheral vestibular disease in older animals. The
incidence is much lower in cats. Thc ctiology of this condition is multifactorial. Otitis media/interna may
develop from extension of otitis externa across the tympanic membrane, from the nasopharynx via the
Eustachian tube, orhematogenously In most cases, otitis externa is thought to develop as a sccondary
complication of various disease processes; such disorders include hypersensitivities (e.g, atopy contact
allergy, food allergy), parasites (e.g., Otodectes cynotis, Demodex canis), foreign bodies, and tumors. The most
common infectious agents are Stapbylococcus species, Streptococcus species, Pseudomonas species, Protes
species, and Malassezia pacbydermatis. In addition to infectious otitis media/interna, an apparently non-
infectious form of otitis media has been described in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. This disorder has been
termed primary secretory otitis media (PSOM) and denotes the accumulation of a viscous mucus plug within
one or both middle ear cavities. These dogs do not have evidence of otitis externa and display clinical signs
of discomfort around the head and neck regions, as well as other indications of otitis media (e.g., head tilt,
that increased production of mucus within the middle ear cavity, decreased drainage of this mucus via an
abnormal Eustachian tube,or a combination of these two factors may be involved.A complete,deep
Otoscopic exam is imperative. Additionally, a myringotomy with associated histopathology, antimicrobial
culture and sensitivity will direct the clinician to a proper treatment regimen. Radiographs or advanced
imaging, that is, computed tomography (CI) and magnetic resonancc (MR) imaging, may confirm involve-
ment of middle and inner ear structures. Occasionally, cases of otitis media/interna may extend centrally. In
these cases, advanced imaging techniques such as MR imaging may help the clinician to prognosticate,
depending on the character of the lesion, and evaluate potential success of treatment (Fig. 8.7). A combina-
tion of surgery (ventral bulla osteotomy) and antibiotic treatment appears to be associated with a favorable
prognosis in cases of bacterial otitis media/interna that extend into the brain in dogs and cats. If myringot-
omy samples are not successful in the diagnosis of an etiologic agent and the animal does not respond to
broad-spectrum antimicrobials, a bulla osteotomy may be indicated both as a treatment modality and to
arrive at a definitive diagnosis of the etiologic agent. Most cats with polyp-associated otitis media/interna

will require a bulla osteotomy for rcsolution of clinical signs. General treatment of otitis media/interna
consists of removal of any offending foreign bodies, adequate control of parasites, and usually long-term
antibiotics or antifungalsspecificallydirected at the offending organism(s)for3-6weeksoruntilresolution
of clinical signs. Occasionally, animals may need to be treated with medications directed at improving signs
associated with motion sickness (e.g., diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate). Any predisposing anatomic
conditions may have to be addressed if the condition is chronic or relapsing (surgical resection or ablation of
the ear canal). The prognosis for recovery is good if the damage to the receptor organs is not severe. Many
animals will be able to centrally compensate for any residual vestibular deficits.
F.Toxic
The same toxic substances that may result in hearing deficits will affect the labyrinthine receptors of the
vestibular system (see below at section VII C on disorders of hearing). Animals will usually present with
signs of unilateral vestibular disease, although bilateral involvement is possible. The most common com-
pounds are antimicrobials that belong to the family of aminoglycosides, loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide,
ethacrynic acid), and ear-cleansing compounds. If toxicity is recognized early, and the offending compound
is discontinued, vestibular signs may resolve.
G. Traumatic
Although uncommon, trauma to the petrous temporal bone may cause unilateral vestibular signs. Disrup-
tion of the bony and membranous labyrinth will predominate; however, if the injury is severe, other adja
cent structures may be affected.It ismuch more common to have associated brain stem,cerebellar,or
supratentorial signs with trauma to this region of the skull. Ipsilateral facial nerve or trigeminal nerve
dysfunction may also result. If the injury is mild or confined to the petrous temporal bone, or the animal
heals from associated areas of trauma (brain stem or cercbellum), the prognosis for recovery from peripheral
vestibular disease is good, providing central compensating mechanisms are adequate.
VI.1
Discases Affecting the Central Vestibular
Any disease process involving the brain has the potential to manifest itself with vestibular dysfunction.
Alterations of normal vestibular pathways as a direct result of ischemia, compression, or infiltration will be
secondary to the primary offending lesion. There are no recognized diseases of the central nervous system
that specifically target the vestibular pathways; however, some of the disease processes that affect the vestibu-
lar structures do so preferentially.

A.Neoplastic
Any neoplastic process, whether primary or secondary, may afect portions of the nervous system involved
signs associated with the tumor may have an acute onset or be slowly progressive. They may result from a
tumor in the immediate vicinity of the brain stem or supratentorial masses that compress the diencephalon
andcausesccondarycompressionofthebrainstem(eitherdirectlyfrombrainparenchymaorviahernia-
tion).Tumors of the fourth ventricle such as choroid plexus papillomas, ependymal tumors, as well as
epidermoid and dermoid cysts, may cause compression of adjacent brain stem structures. Medulloblastomas
originating from the cerebellum may affect the brain stem or the vestibulocerebellum. Oligodendrogliomas
and astrocytomas may involve parenchyma directly associated with vestibular pathways.The most common
brain tumors of dogs that affect vestibular function and associated brain stem areas aremeningiomas and
choroid plexus tumors (Fig. 8.8). Meningiomas and lymphomas are common neoplastic lesions in cats. The
prognosis depends on many factors, including location, tumor type, size, and systemic status of the animal.
Treatment options include glucocorticoids to alleviate any peritumoral edema, chemotherapy, surgery,
radiation therapy, or a combination of all of these (se Chapter 5 for more details concerning brain
tumors).
B.Inflammatory/infectious
The canine distemper virus (CDV) may cause a distemper encephalomyelitis. Older dogs that develop
distemper encephalomyelitis may present with an altered gait and vestibular disease.These dogs usually have
an adequate vaccination history and diagnosis of canine distemper encephalomyelitis can be diffcult.
Cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) may be characterized by a moderate mononuclear pleocytosis that is positive for
the antibody directed at the CDV. It is important to realize that a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier
information regarding diagnostic testing for CDV infection can be found in Chapter 5. Young dogs affected
with distemper encephalomyelitis may recover from their systemic disease. In these cases,resolution of
vestibular signs may follow. Cats infected with the feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus will often develop
vestibular signs.Cats diagnosedwithFIPusuallyhave the dry form of the disease.A diagnosis isbased on
history, potential exposure, clinical signs, and the demonstration of a high CSF antibody titer directed at the
feline coronavirus (see Chapter 5). There is no treatment for the disease, and the prognosis is poor.

APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
Dogs infected with the rickettsial agents causing Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) or ehrlichiosis
may, among other clinical signs, devclop vestibular dysfunction.The diagnosis of rickettsial infection will be
based on potential exposure to ticks, hematological and biochemical abnormalities, clinical signs consistent
with rickettsial disease, a single high titer, and/or a rising titer. Most cases will present between April and
October, with the highest incidence in the month of June. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is typically an
acute onset infectious disease.Characteristic abnormalities may include anorexia,lethargy,fever,cutaneous
lesions, ocular lesions, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and other signs referable to a vasculitis
Vestibular signs may include a horizontal nystagmus and ataxia. Early recognition and treatment with
doxycycline will often result in complete resolution of the disease and vestibular signs.
Meningoencephalomyelitis resulting from primary bacterial infections is an unconmon occurrence in
dogs and cats. When suspected, a CSF tap followed by antimicrobial culture and sensitivity is indicated. A
combination of antimicrobials should provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against most organisms
if a specific etiology cannot be determined. Animals with an inffammatory CSF sample may benefit from
low doses of prednisone (0.5 mg/kg BID). The anti-inflammatory activity of the prednisone may alleviate
some of the infammation responsible for the clinical signs. The dose is low enough that it should not
severely inhibit the immune response and may be discontinued early in the course of treatment (see Chapter

information on the diagnosis and trcarment of toxoplasmiosis and neosporosis. Fungal infections involving
the nervous system may be isolated to neural tissue; howcver, most animals will show other systemic signs of
fungal disease, including cutaneous, ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disease.The most common
cosis may be suspected in dogs with recent respiratory signs. Animals will often recover from a mild respira-
tory tract infection.In order to make this diagnosis, the animals history should indicate that it has been in
the Southwest United States. Another fungal infection that usually affects multiple organs is blastomycosis.
Multifocal disease, along with any indication for potential fungal infection (travel history, unresponsiveness
to antimicrobials, etc.), should give the clinician cause to investigate possible fungal infection with attempts
at direct visualization of the organism from infected tissues, CSF analysis, and serology. The prognosis
depends on the duration of the infection and severity of clinical signs. Fluconazole is the antifungal of
choice for cases of cryptococcosis and coccidioidomycosis.Very few animals show improvement with
antifungal treatmcnt for nervous system infection of blastomycosis. Disseminated protothecosis has been
reported to cause vestibular signs in a dog. Prototheca wickerbarmmi and Prototheca zopfi have been identified
as pathogenic species of algae. Although an uncommon infection, other clinical signs of multi-organ
involvement are usually apparent. The prognosis for animals infected with protothecosis is poor.
It is thought that granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) is a primary autoimrmune disease.
This disease may represent an immune response to an as yet unidentified organism. There are disseminated
(multifocal), focal, and ocular forms of the disease. The distinction between autoimmune disease and
neoplasia has been debated. This disease typically affects middle-aged, small-breed dogs. Brain stem signs
including vestibular dysfunction are the primary signs associated with the disease; however, clinical signs
would be referable to that portion of the nervous system that is most severely affected. In the vast majority
of cases, a definitive diagnosis of GME can only be made on postimortem cxamination of affected tissue.
The histologic lesions consist of perivascular granulomas comprising primarily dense accumulations of

analysis, by ruling out infectious etiologies, and by demonstration of focal or diffuse contrast-enhancing
lesions on CT or MR examination. Lesions may not be evident on CT/MR images in GME cases. On CSF
examination, there is usually a mixed, predominantly mononuclear pleocytosis and moderately elevated
protein.Most animals will initially show a response to systemic corticosteroids; however, the remission of
disease is usually short-lived. Radiation therapy may provide an effective treatment option for dogs with

focal GME. Improved survival times for GME have been obtained in recent years with the use of several
new treatment options, including procarbazine, cyclosporine, and cytosine arabinoside (see Chapter 5).
C.'Toxins
Metronidazole has been associated with vestibular disease.'The onset is acute and usually occurs when
animals feceive high doses of the medication for a long duration. However, signs of metronidazole toxicity
have been scen with treatment for as little as 1 week and as long as 46 wecks. There is much debate as t0
the toxic dosc of metronilazole in the dog. Both dogs and cats are susceptible to metronidazole roxicity, and
the toxicity is well rccognized in hurnans. Clinical signs of metronidazole toxicity usually show up 7--12
days after conrinuous high doses (greater than 60 mg/kg/day), but they have also been reporred to occur at
lower doses. The exact mechanism of the toxicity is unknown. It has been hypothesized that it may interfere
with RNA synthesis or possibly inhibit the actions of the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
cerebellum and vestibular systems, Y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The onset of clinical signs is likely depcn-
dent on the dose the anirnal is receiving. However, clinical signs can also devclop after long-term, low-dose
mental starus, scizurcs, and opisthotonus may be present. Cats are typically affected by altered mental status
and supratentorial dysfiunction (seizures, blindness, and ataxia). Clinical signs will usually resolve within 1-2
weeks after discontinuation of thc drug. Clinical recovery has been shown to be more rapid in dogs that
were treated with injectable and oral diazcpam compared to those that were not treated. In a treated group.
m  s  s i'ii o   o p su   a 
not treared. Some changes to the CNS may result in permanent neurologic defcits. Although a very effec-
tive antimicrobial, metronidazole is not innocuous. It is recommended that the dosage schedule be individu-
alized for every animal, dependent upon the intended target of the drug. For most applicacions of
metronidazole, a total daily dose of 30 mg/kg body weight (e.g., 10 mg/kg body weight, q 8 hr) is
sufficient.
D. Miscellaneous
There are no degenerative processes that are known to specifically affect the certral vestibular system.
Vestibular dysfunction may result secondary to ischemic changes or direct traurma to the vestibular path-
ways. Hydrocephalic animals may have vestibular deficits that are part of the constelation of clinical signs
that are commonly present (see Chapter 5). Metabolic disturbanccs such as hepatic cncephalopathy, altered
electrolyte balance, or renal disease may also cause secondary vestibular signs; howcver, these abnormalities
would not likely cause isolated alterations in vestibular function. Rather, they would result in multifocal.
signs, of which vestibular signs may be part.
Thiamine deficiency is a nutritional disorder that cat affect the vestibular system. Ihe deficiency may
result from a diet that is deficient in thiamine, an all-cooked diet, or a diet that contains large amounts of
thiaininase (fish viscera). Thiamine is neccssary for the completion of the citric acid cycle and therefore is
particularly important in tissues that rely on glucose for energy (brain),. Thiamine deficiency primarily
resulrs in bilatcrally symmetrical areas of necrosis, spongiosis, and hemorrhage in the brain stem. In cats,
the vestibular nuclci are often affected, resulting in vestibular signs. Cerebellar signs consisting of ataxia,
glucose as a fuel source, it too may be affctcd. Bradycardia, tachycardia, and arrhythmias may be appreci
ated with thiamine deficiency. If diagnoscd carly, many animals will respond to parenteral administration of
thiamine hydrochloride (vitamin B). Many animals will have complete resolution of clinical signs if treared
early.
Hypothyroidism has been associated with central vestibular dysfunction in a limited number (10) of
dogs. Whether the pathophysiology of hypothyroid-related central vestibular dysfunction involves infarction,
abnorinal neurotransmitter release, or some combination of these and other factors is unknown. All dogs
responded favorably to thyroid supplementation.

A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINEAND FELINENEUROLOGY
VII.Diseases Affecting the Auditory
Due to the close anatomical relationship between the auditory and vestibular receptors, abnorimalities of
hearing may be observed in conjunction with clinical signs of peripheral vestibular disease. As previously
mentioned, a presumptive diagnosis of deafness is casier to make if bilateral disease is present.
A.Degenerative/anomalous
1. Congenital aplasia/hypoplasia of auditory receptors
Loss of hearing receptors cither in utero or shortly after birth is a very common cause of deaf-
ness in dogs and cats. This is a pure sensorineural deafness due to degeneration of the hair cells in
the organ of Corti. It is thought that an abnormality of the stria vascularis leads to a secondary
degeneration of the hair cells. Once lost, hair cells are gonc forever. Dogs and cats can be either
unilaterally or bilaterally affected with partial or complete hearing loss, respectively. This form of
dcafness often affccts white-colored dogs and cats and merle or piebald-colored dogs. Nonwhite
breeds of dogs, such as the Doberman Pinscher, can also be affected. High-incidence dog breds
include Dalmatian, English Cocker Spaniel, English Setter, Australian Shepherd, Australian Cattle
Dog, and Bull Terrier. Deafness may also be associated with blue eye coloration. White cats that
have two blue eyes have a 50% chance of being born either unilaterally or bilaterally deaf. The
incidence of deafness in Dalmatians is reported to be nearly 30%. Congcnital deafness has been
reported in many breeds (see Table 8.2), although not all have been shown to be hereditary. Because
the degeneration of the organ of Corti may not take place until 3 weeks after birth, it is important
to delay testing of young animals until their auditory apparatus has matured (6-8 weeks). There is a
syndrome of congenital deafness and vestibular dysfunction that has been reported in Beagles.
Congenital deafness may also be the result of exposure to ototoxic drugs in utero.
2.Age-related hearing loss
Older animals may be affected by slowly progressive hearing loss. This senile degencration may
affect the osicles of the middle ear, resulting in conduction deafness, or the auditory receptor (organ
of Corti), resulting in sensorineural deafness. This may be mistakenly interpreted as cognitive
dysfunction syndrome (see Chapter 5). A brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) test will
confirm the dysfunction, usually seen as an attenuation of all waveforms and increased latency from
stimulus to appearance of wave I (hearing impairment) or the absence of waveforms (complete
dcafness). Senilc ossicle or receptor dysfunction usually has a slow progression, and there is no
treatment for the progression of the condition; however, hearing aids may be used in animals. The
success of a hearing aid is dependent on the tolerance of the animal to having a foreign body
constantly in its ear.Placing inexpensive foan earplugs in the animal's ear to see is a good way to
test potential tolerance to a hearing aid.
3.Structural anomalies of the brain
Hydrocephalus and other anomalous structural conditions that affect the brain may affect
auditory function. These dogs may have difficulty localizing sound due to poor development of
higher auditory centers. Structural brain anomalies are discussed in Chapter 5.
B.Infammatory/infectious
Peripheral vestibular disease is often a result of otitis in dogs and cats. It is one of the most common
conditions diagnosed as causing secondary vestibular disease. Otitis may affect the external car (otitis
externa), the middle ear (otitis media), the inner ear (otitis interna), or combinations of thesc three loca-
tions. A thorough otoscopic examination is essential for diagnosis. A normal otoscopic exam does not rule
out otitis as a potential cause of either hearing loss or vestibular disease. Otitis externa or media may cause a
conduction block, resulting in a hearing deficit of the affected ear. Otitis interna may be severe enough to
cause sensorineural hearing deficits. Some of the more common isolates from the car are Streptococcus spp.,

Pseudomonas spp., and Staphylococcus spp. Treatment should be based on results obtained from culture and
sensitivity testing. Long-term (e.g., 4-6 weeks) treatment with systemic antimicrobials is often necessary. In
addition to systemic antibiotics, otitis cxterna may be treated with topical antimicrobial preparations and
canal resection, total ear canal ablation, and bulla osteotomy. Nasopharyngeal polyps are often associated
andoften grow toward the path of least resistance, the pharyngotympanic Eustachian)tubehey canfn
be seen within the nasopharynx. Cats will usually have clinical signs referable to a nasopharyngeal mass (e.
syndrome. They may be plucked from the nasopharynx or, preferably, removed surgically via a ventral bulla
osteotomy. Nasopharyngeal polyps are much less likely to recur if removed via ventral bulla osteotomy.
C. Toxic
There are numerous known and suspected ototoxic agents that may cause vestibular signs and deafness.
Often the vestibular dysfunction is reversible upon withdrawal of the compound; however, deafness is
usually permanent. The most commonly incriminated compounds are the aminoglycoside antimicrobials
and ear-cleaning solutions. Many of the suspected ototoxicities are anecdotal. Ototoxic substances may gain
exposure to the inner ear via a ruptured tympanic membrane when applied topically or hematogenously.
Once in the middle ear, the substance enters the inner ear through the oval or round window. Toxin-
mediated destruction may involve the cochlea, the semicircular canals, or the vestibule and typically affects
the hair cells cither directly or indirectly via alteration of the stria vascularis. Many commonly used ear-
cleaning solutions may be ototoxic if applied in an ear with a ruptured tympanic membrane. Possible
substitutions for ceruminolytic agents are dilute acetic acid (white vinegar) and saline at a 1: 3 ratio or saline
alone. If hearing loss or vestibular disease is suspected due to a potential ototoxic agent, the use of the
compound should be discontinued immediately. Prognosis for recovery will depend on the age, species,
breed, general health status, time of use, and application of usc.
D. Traumatic
temporal bone may fracture and injure the vestibulocochlear nerve. The higher auditory centers may also be
affected by cranial trauma; in these cases there would likely be signs of diffuse and severe neurologic impair-
ment. (see Chapter 6),
E.Miscellaneous
A rare condition called otoacoustic enmission (OAE) has been reported in several dogs and one cat. This
disorder is similar to tinnitus of people. In addition to their normal fuinction of converting sound waves to
mechanical vibrations, the outerhair cells of the cochlea are apparently able to generate sound by vibrating.
The etiology of OAE is unknown.Typicaly, a continuous high-frequency ringing tone can be heard ema-
nating from the affected ear. Behavioral responses to sound are normal in affected patients, as are BAER
tests. There is no known effective trcatment for OAE, but the disorder does not appear to pose any adverse
effects on health.

A.Peripheral disease
When a suspected peripheral nerve disease is presented, a thorough otoscopic exam should be performed to
completely evaluate the outer ear. An otoscopic exam may also give clues to the examiner regarding the
integrity of the middle ear. A bulging, discolored tympanic membrane may be indicative of otitis media. If
so equipped, an otoscope with a side port may be used to subjectively test the compliance of the tympanic
membrane with a gentle puff of air. The authors use a short piece of rubber tubing attached to the port on
8/DISORDERS OFHEARING AND BALANCE
281
the head of the otoscope. While visualizing the rympanic membrane, a gentle puff of air is blown into
thc tubing and the tympanic meimbrane is observed to see how much deformation occurs. lf the middle ear
is fuid filled or occluded by tissue, the compliance of the tympanic membranc will be decreased. A thor-
ough otoscopic exam almost always requires general ancsthesia. This examination can be performed in
conjunction with other diagnostic tests that require gencral anesthesia (e.g., radiographs, CT, MRI, CSF
(ap).
Indirect evaluation of the auditory system is possible using electrodiagnnostics. The BAER test (see
Chapter 4) is one rnethod of evaluating the auditory pathways. 'This test is usually perforimed in awake dogs
and cats; however, it can also be performed with mild sedarion or anesthesia, if necessary. Ihe poteritials
that are mcasured result from a far field recording of an evoked rcsponsc. To perform this test, clicks or
tones are generated in the ear of the aninal, and the response of the brain stcm and auditory pathways is
recorded using needle elcctrodes placed on the scalp and near the ear. The test gencrates an carly latency
waveform within I--10 ms, indicating various activitics within the brain. With peripheral discasc, therc
would be attenuated or absent waveforms. This does not differentiate between conduction block and
sensorineural block. However, a bone resonator may be used to stimulate the cochlea directly by placing it
on the mastoid process of the temporal bone (junction of nuchal crest and caudal aspect of the zygomatic
arch). A conduction block may be differentiated from sensorineural block because the mechanical vibrations
generated by the resonator will themselves activate the receptor organ directly, effectively bypassing the
external and middle ear cavities. The BAER is able to evaluate both ears. Most animals with bilateral
deafness can be diagnosed with confidence based on a thorough physical and neurologic exam. An animal
with unilateral deafness will often appear normal clinically and therefore can only reliably be diagnosed by
pcrforming a BAER test.
testing of the acoustic reflex. Tympanometry can be used to evaluate rhe size of the intcrnal car, the inregrity
and compliance of the tympanic membrane, and the function of the middle ear components (ossicles and
muscles). In chis test, a tube is inserted into the external auditory canal that delivers both an auditory
tympanic membrane inside the sealed cavity are measured. The curve of the tympanogram will tell the
examiner information about the compliance of the tympanic membrane. An abnormally high compliance
(Habby tympanic membrane) would result from damage to the ossicles. An abnormally low compliance (stiff
tympanic membranc) may result froin otosclerosis. The acoustic refex is a protcctive mechanism to prevent
damage to middle and inner ear structures. The refex is mediated through the affcrent arm of the cochlear
nerve. The efferent portion is generated via both the facial nerve, which innervates thc stapedius muscle,
and the trigeminal nerve, which inervates the tcnsor tympani rmuscle. When a loud noise is received by the
inner ear, the refex contraction of the middle ear muscles prevents excessive displacerment of the ossicles,
which could damage the ear. Of course, there is a delay in the reflex; very loud, sudden noises may cause
significant damage.
Imaging techniques for evaluating the peripheral vestibular system and auditory components are rather
limired. Radiographs of the skull may provide the clinician with che “foorprints? of discase, such as sclerosis
of the external acoustic meatus and bulla. These may prompt the examiner to take a closer look at thc
problem; however, laclk of evidencc of bony changes does not rule out the possibiliry of disease. Compured
tomography greatly enhances the cvaluation of the bony components of the peripheral nervous system by
providing transverse images through the area of interest. Magnetic resonance imaging can be performed and
provides the abiliry to look at changes in the bulla, alowing the clinician to distinguish between Huid and
soft tissue abnormalities (including the presence of polyps). On MR imaging, the air-illed bulla would
appear hypointense (black). Refer to Chapter 4 for more information concerning MR imaging.
If a case of otiris media/interna is suspected, a myringotomy may be performed. This diagnostic test
requires general anesthesia. A needle is used to puncture the tympanic membrane, and fuid, if present, is
aspirated and evaluated through cylology, culture, and antimicrobial sensitivity. The tympanic mernbrane
will heal from this procedure, if it is performed correctly.

A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
B. Central disease
The BAER rest can be helpful in differentiating central from peripheral vestibular disease. If the sound
waves can gct to the organ of Corti, and the animal is not deaf, then the evoked response should be visible
as a series of wavcs that represent brain stem activity. The cxact locations of the generation of the waves in
the brain are not completely known. It is agrced that the gcnerator of the first wave is the vestibulocochlear
nerve. The other waves typically visualizcd (waves I-V) represent various nuclei and pathways for auditory
function in the brain (see Chapter 4). The Jatencies (tirne necessary for thc generation of the wave following
a stirmulus), amplitude, and morphology (right vs. left) of the waves are evaluatcd. T'he first wave will often
be present, followed by abnorrnal waves and increased interwave intervals (latencics), in cases of central
vestibular discase. The BAER test has also been used to cvaluate brain death, often in conjunction with
clectroencephalography (EE(G)
Radiographs may be of benefit when cvaluating an animal for suspected skullrrauma. Becausc of
anatomic variations and diffculty with corrcct positioning and interprctation, skull radiographs do not
provide a high level of diagnostic information regarding central vestibular disease. Computed tomography
will allow the clinician to evaluate the skull and brain in the transverse (axial) plane. Contrast may be added
to demonstrate any break in the blood-brain barrier, Computed tomography may hc a better diagnostic tool
for evaluating bone; however, an MR exam will allow for adequate evaluation of bonc and superior evalua-
tion of soft tissue, and it will potentially save the animal from undergoing a second anesthctization if no
abnormalities are seen on CT examination. It is the best test for the evaluation of structural brain discase.
Magnetic resonance imaging will give a multiplanar evaluation of brain strucrures, is noninvasivc, and is
rapidly performcd in the hands of a skilled technician. The drawbacks to MR examination are both a
paucity of facilities in which the test can be performcd and the limited access to personnel adequate in their
evaluation. Most major citics and universitics will have access to animal-dedicated MR facilities within the
next few years. A diagnosis of infammatory brain disease can only be made with CSF analysis. The authors
typically perform this test following MR evaluation of the brain. It has been. hypothesized that in the face of
increased intracranial pressure, a cisternal tap may alter the homeostasis of pressure relationships in the
brain, which may lead to secondary brain stem herniation (transtentorial or foraminal). In cases of large
structural abnormalities (mass effect), a lumbar tap rnay decrease the chances of herniation (although it is
not eliminated). This potential advantage of performing a lumbar versus cisternal CSF tap remains to be
provcd. Although many cisternal taps have been performed wirh no complications in the face of large,
compressive brain masscs, caution shouild be used. Evaluation of CSF is discussed in Chapter 4.

The cerebelluin is unique both structurally and functionally within the central nervous system (CNS).
efficient and accurate processing of motor function. A basic understanding of the cerebellum's role in the
nervous system is helpful when considering how pathology within the cerebellum affecrs clinical functions.
The cercbellum is responsible for modification, rather than the initiation, of movement. The cerebellum
functions to coordinate segmental movenents so they are fuid in nature and to aid in ensuring movements
are achieved in an efficient manner. The cerebellum helps to regulate posture, unconscious proprioception
(the position of the body in space),and muscle tone.The cerebellum is also believed to infuence conscious
thought processes, such as judging the timing of events and solving spatial and perceptual reasoning
problems.

Divisions 0f the Cerebellum 13.32,59,81,95.107,127,18
The cerebellum can be conceptually divided in numerous ways, according to developmental, anatomical,
and functional features. Depending upon the clinical situation and clinician preference, an understanding of
the cerebellum can be framed in the context of these different categorization schemes.
Phylogenetically, the cerebellum can be divided into three parts. The archicerebellum is the oldest part
and is composed of the focculonodular lobe. The paleocerebellum is next in line and consists of the most
rostral portion of the cerebellum, rostral to the primary fissure. Finally, the neocerebellum is the newest and
largest portion of the cerebellum and is composed of the hemispheres and paravermal portion caudal to the
primary fissure.
Anatomically, the structure of the cerebellum contains the two lateral hemispheres, a median portion
（the vermis),and a small ventral portion, the focculonodular lobe.The superficial surface folds of the
cerebellum are known as folia (Fig. 9.1). On the cut section, the cerebellum has many branching, infolded
sections known as arbor vitae (meaning “tree of life"). Embedded within the deep white mattcr are the three
paired “roof” nuclei. From medial to lateral, these are known as the fastigial, interposital, and dentate nuclei
(Fig. 9.2). The dentate nucleus is also referred to as the lateral nucleus in some texts. These nuclei are
synaptic centers for both afferent and efferent information. The cerebellum makes up the dorsal half of the
metencephalon, with the pons comprising the ventral half. The cerebellum is attached to the brain stem by
the three paired cerebellar peduncles, which act as conduits for both afferent and efferent information
related to cerebellar function.
Finally, and probably most importantly, the cerebellum can be functionally divided into the cerebrocer-
ebellum, spinocerebellum, and vestibulocerebellum.Each functional division is related to its associated
anatomical structures (Fig. 9.3).The cerebrocerebellum consists of the cerebellar hemispheres, is associated
is necessary for the coordinated implementation of voluntary, planned, multijoint movements. Additionally,

synaptic contacts with Purkinje cell dendrites that extend into the molecular layer.

The Purkinje cell layer contains the highly ordered and uniformly arranged large cell bodies of the
Purkinje cells. This layer, located between the molecular layer and the granule cell layer, contains the cells
responsible for the output of the cerebellum. Purkinje cells are large, highly metabolically active, and
therefore very susceptible to ischemic or toxic damage. These inhibitory neurons utilize gamma-aminobu-
tyric acid (GABA) as their neurotransmitter. The myelinated axons of Purkinje cells leave the cerebellar
cortex to synapse on the deep cerebellar nuclei. Along the way, these axons willsend collateral projections
offin the granule cell layer to synapse on neurons located there. Additionally, the Purkinje cells will send
fanlike dendritic processes into the molecular layer. These projections run perpendicular to the parall fibers
in the molecular layer. The parallel fbers run through the dendritic processes of the Purkinje cells much like
electrical wires running through a bushy tree, making cross synapses with the Purkinje dendrites as they
travel throughout the molecular layer.

layer where they function as parallel fibers making cross synapses with the Purkinje dendrites (the electrical

are inhibitory neurons that utilize GABA as their neurotransmitter.Dendrites from the Golgi cells extend
throughout all layers of the cerebellar cortex.Their axons form specialized synapses at the cerebellar glom-
eruli.The glomeruli are chiefy madeup of axonal endings of mossy fbers (one of the two types of afferent
projections into the cerebellum). Dendrites and axons from the Golgi cells, as well as dendrites from the
granule cells, will synapse in the cerebellar glomeruli.

The cerebellum receives sensory information from the entire nervous system yet projects its regulatory
information to specific areas of the brain and spinal cord. The ascending and descending spinal cord tract
related to cerebellar function are summarized in Fig. 9.5. The three different functional subdivisions of thc
cerebellum cach receive primary information from specific portions of the nervous system (Fig. 9.3). The
main contributions to each subdivision will be discussed; however, it is important to realize that afferent
information to the cerebellum is distributed to all subdivisions in varying degrees. The cerebrocerebellum
(hemispheres) receives input from the cerebral cortex via the pons (corticopontine fibers). Axons of the
corticopontine fibers originate from the cerebral cortex, synapse on the deep pontine nuclei, cross midline as
the transverse fibers of the pons, and ascend through the middle cerebellar peduncle. This information
assists the cerebrocerebellum with motor planning.
The vestibulocerebellum (focculonodular lobe) primarily receives afferent projections from the vestibu-
lar labyrinth indirectly via the vestibular nuclei in the medulla and directly via conncctions from the ves-
tibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve [CN] VIl). It also receives information from the lateral geniculate nuclei
and rostral colliculi via the pontine nuclei (corticopontine tracts). All information entering the cerebellum
from the pontine nuclei ascends through the middle cerebellar peduncle. This information will help the
cerebellum with balance (both while standing and ambulating) and eye movements.

The spinocerebellum (vermis and intermediate zone) receives afferent information regarding joint
position and lower motor neuron status from the spinal cord (spino-olivary tracts, spinocerebellar tracts, and
cuneocerebellar tracts).
The neural pathways names are a combination of their place of origination in the nervous system and
their place of termination.For example, the spinocerebellar tracts originate in the spinal cord and terminate
in the cerebellum; therefore, they are termed spinocerebellar. In general, the spinocerebellar tracts convey
information from the limbs and body to the ipsilateral cerebellum.Proprioceptive information from the
lower body and pelviclimbs is conveyed to the cerebellumvia the dorsal andventral spinocerebellar tracts
(Fig. 9.6), whereas such information from the cervical region and thoracic limbs is conveyed to the cerebel-
lum primarily via the cuneocerebellar (spinocuneocerebellar) and rostral (cranial) spinocerebellar tracts (Fig.
9.7). The dorsal spinocerebellar tract sends information from cutancous, muscle, and joint receptors regard-
ing proprioception from the pelvic limbs and caudal region of the body.This tract is located in the dorsal
portion of the lateral funiculus.The information is projected to the ipsilateral cerebellum and enters via the
caudal cerebellarpeduncle.Theventral spinocerebellartract,which also conveys informationfrom thepelvic
limbs and caudal body region,is also located in the lateral funiculus,ventral to the dorsal spinocerebellan

tract.It sendsinformation frommuscle receptors and Golgi tendon organs,which ultimately reaches the
ipsilateral cerebellum (after crossing midline twice) via the rostral cerebellar peduncle. The spinocuneocer-
ebellar tract (cuneocerebellar tract), located in the lateral portion of the dorsal funiculus (fasciculus cunea-
tus), primarily sends proprioceptive information from cutaneous, muscle, and joint receptors from the
ipsilateral thoracic limb and cranial part of the body.It projects to the cerebellum via the caudal cerebellar
peduncle. It is named by its synaptic connections with the lateral cuneate nucleus in the medulla (rostrolat-
eral to the medial cuneate nucleus), where spinal projections synapse prior to entering the cerebellum. The
rostral spinocerebellar tract (medial to the ventral spinocerebellar tract) also conveys information from the
thoracic limbs and cranial aspect of the body. Axons of this tract enter the ipsilateral rostral and caudal
cerebellar peduncles.The cervicospinocerebellar tract is a pathway conveying proprioceptive information
from the neck region (first four cervical spinal cord segments) to the contralateral caudal cerebellar pedun-
cle. The axons of this tract synapse in the rostral vermis. The cerebellum indirectly (via the pontine nuclei)
receives visual and auditory information through the collicular nuclei via the middle cerebellar peduncle and
vestibular input from the vestibular nuclei via the caudal cerebellar peduncle. This information is organized
somatotopically and represents entire maps of the body projected in the region of the vermis and intermedi-
ate zone of the cerebellar hemispheres.

All of the projections to the cerebellum are either mossy fibers or climbing fibers (Fig. 9.4). These
excitatory fibers alone control the activity and therefore the output of the Purkinje cells. For the most part,
afferent axons enter the cerebellum through either the caudal or middle cerebellar peduncles. In general,
information from the pons (metencephalon) enters the cerebellum through the middle cerebellar peduncle
and information from the medulla (myelencephalon) enters through the caudal cerebellar peduncle. Excep-
tions include the ascending proprioceptive information from the pelvic limbs coursing in the ventral spino-
cerebellar tract and a portion of the ascending information from the thoracic limbs conveyed by the rostral
spinocerebellar tract. These axons enter the cerebellum through the rostral cerebellar peduncle.
Mossy fibers primarily originate from the spinal cord, reticular formation, vestibular nuclei, and pontine
nuclei. They indirectly influence the firing of Purkinje neurons through their interactions with granule cells
in the granule cell layer.The granule cells are cxcitatory interneurons.The interaction of mossy fbers and
granule cells occurs at the cerebellar glomeruli where mossy fiber terminals come into contact with Golgi
cell axons and granule cell dendrites. A single mossy fiber will typically activate a cluster of granule cells, the
axons of which will ascend into the molecular layer. Along the way, the granule cell axons will send off
collaterals to Purkinje cells. Once in the molecule layer, these granule cell axons will become parallel fibers
where they then again have the opportunity to interact at cross synapses with the Purkinje dendrites that
extend into the molecular layer.

Three additional fiber types innervate all areas of the cerebellar cortex.All of these fibers enter the
cerebellum as mossy fibers. One of the fiber types originates from the locus ceruleus and releases norepi-
nuclei and contains serotonin. These fibers do not synapse on Purkinje cells. Both of these fibers are
thought to possibly play a role in emotional states and cerebellar function.A third fiber type originates from
undefinedbrainstemnuclei andreleases acetylcholine.
Climbing fibers originate from a single source, the olivary nucleus (rostral myelencephalon). The olive
receives descending input from the cerebral cortex and brain stem upper motor neuron centers, as well as
ascending input from the ventral spinocerebellar tract. Information from the olivary nucleus projects to the
cerebellum,sending offcollateralstothecerebellarnuclei,and continues intothePurkinjecell layer toform
direct excitatory contact with Purkinje neurons. A Purkinje neuron receives input from a single climbing
fiber, and a single climbing fiber will interact with several Purkinje neurons. Of all the excitatory synapses in
the CNS, the climbing fiber's interaction with the Purkinje neuron is one of the most powerful. An action
potential from a climbing fiber will produce a prolonged depolarization of the target Purkinje cell. While
mossy fibers rely on temporal and spatial summation to excite a Purkinje neuron, the climbing fber can
accomplish this with a single action potential.

Efferent Projections from the Cerebellum1,131.3259.81,86
As stated previously, the only output of the cerebellum is via Purkinje axons. The Purkinje neurons exert an
inhibitory influence on the tonically active deep cerebellar nuclei. As with the afferent organization, the
9/ CEREBELLARDISEASESAND TREMORSYNDROMES

efferent projections from the cerebellum cann be categorized based upon the three major subdivisions (Fig.
9.3). Purlkinje neurons from the most lateral subdivision, the cercbroccrebcllum, project ro the most lareral
cerebellar nuclei, the dentarc nuclei. From the dentate nucleus, fbers desccnd through the contralateral
rostral cerebellar peduncle to rhe ventral lateral nuclcus of the thalamus. By crossing back to the contralat-
eral rostral peduncle, the cerebroccrcbellar projections will project to the ipsilateral ccrcbral cortex. As
described earlier, the corticoponrinc fibcrs, which project to the cerebrocerebellum, cross in the pons ro
project to the contralateral cerebrocerebellum; the efferent projections cross back to mainrain an ipsilateral
circuit. The thalamic projections influence the motor and premotor areas of the cortex. Additionally, the
dentate nucleus sends projections to the red nucleus in the mesencephalon. These projections form a.
complex feedback circuit back to the cerebellum through the olivary nucleus. They do not make up any
portion of the rubrospinal tract (a descending spinal projection thiat originates from the red nucleus). The
effercnt projections of the cerebrocerebellum are responisible for the coordination and planning of limb
movements. Somc of the vestibulocerebellum's Purkinje neurons project directly to the vestibular nuclei in.
the medulla. These arisc primarily frorn the focculonodular lobc. Neurons of the fastigial rucleus also
project to the vestibular nuclci. The vestibular nuclei givc rise to the lateral and medial vestibulospinal
tracts, which ru in the ventral funiculi of the spinal cord white matter (Fig, 9.5), The main output is
necessary for control of axial and proximal limb muscles in order to maintain balance.Vestibulocercbellar
projections are also responsible for coordinated eye and head movements, as well as vestibular refexes.
The spinoccrchcllum's output is projected through the fastigial and the interposital nuclei. The fastigial
nucleus receives ourput from the vermis. Some of these fibers asccnd to the cerebral cortex; however, most
efferents descend to the vestibular niclei and the reticular formation, both of which contribute fibers to the
medial descending motor systems. The inrerposiral nuclcus receives output from thc intermediate zone
(medial hemispheres). Axons of thc intcrposiral nuclei continue on to infuence lateral dcsccnding motor
tracts. The areas of the cerebellum contributing to the medial descending motor pathways are responsible
for the regulation of axial and proximal musculature. Axons from the interposital nuclei descend through
thc rostral cerebellar peduncle to the contralateral red nucleus.‘They continue to the ventral lareral nucleus
distal limb muscles by cxerring their infuence on both the corticospinal and the rubrospinal tracts, which
are two of the lateral desccnding motor pathways. Efferents of the spinocerchellum coordinate the actions
 of axial and limb muscles to smooth out intended movements and dampen oscillations of ongoing
movements.
VI.Functions 0f the Cerebellum110,13,15.20,21.25,45,53.59,96,100107,12126,132,137,141,194
The cerebellurn has traditionally been thought of as a modulator or regulator of movement initiated by the
cerebrum. Experiments have shown that neurons in the dentate nucleus (cerebrocerebellum) acrually begin
firing before neurons in the cerebral motor cortex that are responsible for the intended movement. Neurons
in the fastigial and intcrposital nuclei (spinocerebellum) fire after the movement has begun, and their
activity is directly relared to the velocity and force of the movement. This suggests that the cerebrocerebel.
lum is actually involved with the intention to move and therefore linked to cognitive funcrion at some level,
whereas the spinocerebellum rmonitors the consequcnces of the evolving movement. It is wcll acccpted that
the cerehcllum plays a inuch greater role in an animal's cognitive awareness and output related to its
cnvironmcnt.
The roles of the cerebrocerebellum and spinocerebellum in the initiation and execution of moveinent
can be hypothetically mapped out (Fig. 9.8). The upper loop involves the cerehrocerebellum, which, along
with the premotor cortex, is important for the programming of furure movemcnts. The lower loop involves
the spinocerebellum, which, along with the cerebral motor cortex, regulates evolving movements.

neurons to generate a new response.
VII. Clinical Signs of Cerebellar Dysfunction,1,3.15,59.81.9,11.140
Clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction can generally be referred to as abnormalities in the rate, range,
direction, and force of motor movements. Lesions of the cerebellum typically result in ipsilateral deficits.
This physiological phenomenon is due to the fact that output through the rostral cerebellar peduncle is
crossed and primarily acts to modify movement generated through the corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts,
which are also crossed. Pure cerebellar disease docs not result in paresis (weakness). There are usually no
conscious proprioceptive deficits; however, during a neurologic evaluation, it is important to consider that a
specific lesion may involve multiple areas of the nervous system. Therefore, a cervical lesion may affect
spinocerebellar tracts and conscious proprioceptive pathways (such as cervical vertebral instability in young,
large-breed dogs). Disorders of cerebellar function may result in specific alterations in motor function.
These deficits may exhibit themselves as hypermetria or hypometria, ataxia, dysmetria, and
tremors.
It is more common for dogs and cats with cerebellar disease to exhibit signs of hyperinetria. This results
from the delay in the cessation of the intended movement and typically manifests itself at gait as the animal
takes on a toy soldier” appearance. The limbs are stiff and frequently overreaching. There is usually a
broad-based stance, and the intended movement will overshoot the goal with an excessive rebound. Ataxia
can be thought of as the manifestation of a constellation of signs resulting from hypermetria, dysmetria, and
coordination in the execution of multisegmental movements. Since the cerebellum is usually affected in a
diffuse manner, the clinical sign of ataxia is a common one. Ataxia simply refers to the “lack of an axis” or
can be thought of as movement away from the axis of the body (a straight line drawn from the nose to the
tail). The animals will have a broad-based stance and sway from side to side at gait. The head will often
297
oscillate, as the vestibulocerebellar function is also affected. Affected patients tend to have difficulty main-
taining their balance and are easily tipped over.
Since the spinocerebellum is somatotopically organized, a lesion of the vermis or fastigial nucleus will
produce titubation. Titubation is a shaking of the trunk and head while sitting or standing, which is com-
monly referred to as the drunken sailor's gait. Tremors of cerebellar origin are referred to as intention
as the to-and-fro movements or oscillations of the head and neck, which become more severe as the animal
begins to reach the goal (such as a food bowl). Intention tremors imply a lesion of the cerebrocerebellum,
the more lareral areas of the cerebellar hemispheres or the dentate nucleus. This is the area of thc cerebellum
primarily influencing the application of voluntary movemcnt. Lesions of the vestibulocerebellum (flocculo-
nodular lobe), vestibular nuclei, or fastigial nucleus may cause nystagmus, strabismus, loss of balance, and a
head tilt either toward or away from (paradoxical) the side of the lesion.
Lesions of the rostral cercbclar peduncles and deep cerebellar nuclei produce the most severe clinical
signs. An abnormality in the region of the fastigial nucleus in cats may produce contralateral pupilary
dilation. The affected pupil will not be completely responsive to lighr (miosis), and there will be partial
protrusion of the ipsilateral third eyelid. With lesions of the interposital nucleus, the same pupillary light
abnormalities will occur as in a fastigial nucleus lesion; however, the affected pupil is ipsilateral to the lesion.
Paradoxical vestibular syndrome and decerebellate rigidity are two classic signs of cerebellar disease.
Occasionally, animals will present with a head tilt and paresis on thc opposite side of the hcad tilt, and they
may or may not have other signs of cerebellar dysfunction (e.g., nystagmus or tremor). Lesions of the
focculonodular lobe or caudal cerebellar peduncles will produce these signs. In these cases the head tilt is
paradoxical in that it is away from the side of the lesion. The lesion can be localized to the same side as the
most severe conscious proprioceptive deficits. This paradoxical vestibular syndrone is likely due to an
abnormality in the vestibuloccrebellum, which contains many crossed and uncrossed pathways and, depend-
ing on the location and severiy of the lesion, may result in the contralatcral head tilt (see Chapter 8).
Decerebellate rigidity is seen with severe cerebellar abnorinalities. It is characterized by rigid extension of the
forelirnbs, alternating fexed or extended hind limbs, and opisthotonus. If damage is confined to thc cercbel-
lum, consciousness is maintained. The classic differentiation thcrcfore, between an animal with decerebrate
posturing and decerebellate posturing is the animals level of consciousness. A deccrebrate animal will be
stuporous or comatose.
Occasionally, animals with cerebellar disease will have absent or decreased menace responses ipsilateral
to the lesion. The menace deficit is produced despite normal visual pathways and facial nerve function. The
cerebellum is known to play a rolc in the inhibition. of micturition, and diseases of the cerebellum may
therefore play a part ini disorders of micrurition (see Chapter 13)

suspected to be autosomal recessive traits. The etiology for this group of disorders is unknown. Lack
of a metabolic component necessary for cellular survival may be involved. Some of these abiotrophies

described in Old English Sheepdogs. These dogs exhibited primarily gait abnormalities (beginning
between 6 and 40 months of age) that were mild and slowly progressive. A late-onset (more than 1
year of age) cerebellar abiotrophy has also been reported in a number of cats, including two feral
cats,a Persian cat,a Siamese cat and a domestic shorthaired cat.The latter cat also exhibited retinal

Neurodiagnostics have generally not been beneficial in the antemortem diagnosis of this condi-
tion; however, in several breeds there are gross structural abnormalities of the cerebellum (hypoplasia

transportable products in the distal ends of the affected axons. The disease is genetically transmitted
in cats and is thought to be hereditary in dogs as well. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is
suspected. The onset of clinical signs relating to the cerebellar syndrome is typically within the first
few months of life in the Chihuahua, Collie,Papillon,Jack Russell Terrier, as well as the Siamese
and domestic shorthaired cat. Boxers may be affected between 1 and 7 months of age. The Rottwei-
lerisaffectedwithin1to2years,andtheGermanshepherdmaybe affected at around15months
In the case of the Rottweiler, there maybe severe degeneration of the dorsal columns of the cervical
spinal cord. These dogs often have conscious proprioceptive deficits, as well as cerebellar dysfunction.
Neuroaxonal dystrophy is usually slowly progressive, ultimately leading to multifocal CNS dysfunc-
tion,and thereis no treatment.
3.Cerebellarmalformation
It is thought that a genetically transmitted condition of cerebellar hypoplasia exists. This condi-
tion has been reported in a Chow Chow,Boston Terrier, Airedale Terrier, Irish Setter, Wire-haired
Fox Terriers, and Bull Terrier. The reported malformations vary from complete absence of the
cerebellum or parts of the cerebellum (agenesis), abnormal development of the cerebellum with no
differentiationoftissue(aplasia),and abnormal developmentofthecerebellumwithsome differen-

tiation of tissue (hypoplasia). The condition is present at birth and likely represents failure of normal
cerebellar development. The condition is not progressive, and clinical signs may improve as the
animal matures.
4.Dandy-Walker syndrome
 Dandy-Walker syndrome is a rare congenital malformation that shares similarities with the
human form of the disease.It consists of a triad of congenital anomalies,including cerebellar vermis
hypoplasia (Fig. 9.12), a communicating hydrocephalus, and the presence of a fuid-flled cyst
(syrinx) within the posterior fossa. In humans, Dandy-Walker syndrome is one of several congenital
syndromes typified by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. It has been reported in several dogs with no
breed or sex predilection and in a kitten.The clinical signs are typical of cerebellar disease (ataxia,
hypermetria,absent menace,and tremors).Some dogs have also displayed a head tilt and circling.It
isunknownif thevestibular signs are due to thecerebellardisease ormanifestations of the other
developmental abnormalities. The clinical signs are typically not progressive, therefore surgical
intervention may not be rewarding. The condition has been reported in one kitten. Affected animals
usuallypresentearlyinlifearound3monthsof age.There isnotreatment.
5. Foramen magnum-associated malformations
Malformation of the caudal aspect of the skull, similar to Chiari Type I disorder of people, has
been described in small-breed dogs. These “Chiari-like” malformations, also termed caudal occipital
include rostral displacement ofthe caudal aspect of the occipital bone,withcaudal displacement of
the caudoventral aspect of the cerebellum into or through the foramen magnum. There may be
meningeal fibrosis at the cervicomedullary junction in dogs with these malformations. Overcrowding
of the caudal fossa region is believed to lead to hydromyelia/syringomyelia, especially in the cervical
spinal cord region. Concurrent hydrocephalus may also be present. Some patients with Chiari-like
malformations may display evidence of cerebellovestibular dysfunction. Medical therapy (e.g., low
doses of prednisone) may be successful in some cases of Chiari-like malformations. Foramen
magnum decompression (FMD) is usually successful in people with the disorder, and the authors
have had some success in dogs treated similarly.
Occipital dysplasiais a controversial anatomical abnormality of the occipitalbone.The contro-
versy centers primarily on whether occipital dysplasia simply represents anatomic skull variation or is

an actual disease state. This condition also primarily affects small-breed dogs. In cases of occipital
dysplasia, the region of the occipital bone comprising the dorsal boundary of the foramen magnum
(supraoccipital bone) is malformed and replaced by a membranous band of tissue. This abnormality
   e n   p e n   s e  n 
dorsal to the foramen magnum. Often, the caudal aspect of the cerebellum and the dorsal aspect of
the cranial cervical spinal cord-caudal brain stem are exposed. It has been proposed that fuid-filled
cavities in the brain stem and cranial cervical spinal cord seen on MR examination of dogs with this
condition are secondary to abnormal pulsation of cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) through the foramen
magnum. However, concurrent COMS (Chiari-like malformation) and occipital dysplasia have been
documented in dogs. In addition to the possibility that occipital dysplasia, by itself, does not repre-
sent a disease entity it has been suggested that the decompressive effect of this defect may actually
delay the development of clinical signs related to COMS in dogs that have both abnormalities
prescnt. The authors have surgically removed this band of tissue in several dogs and have seen an
improvement in clinical signs relating to ataxia and cerebellovestibular disease.
B.Neoplasia
1.Primary brain tumors
Numerous primary neoplasms can affect the cerebellum. Typically, adjacent structures such as
the brain stem and associated cranial nerves are affected as well.Not all neoplastic process may be
histologically considered invasive or malignant; however,because of the limited space for expansion,
they are not considered to be benign, from a clinical point of view. Meningiomas are the most
common brain tumor of dogs and cats. Unlike the meningiomas of humans and cats, dog meningio-
mas tend to be invasive to surrounding tissue and therefore difficult to remove entirely surgically
They usually form at the cercbellopontine or cerebellomedullary junction and grow toward the path
of least resistance,which is usually into the fourth ventricle.For this reason, they can be mistaken
for choroid plexus tumors, which arise from the ventricles. They may also arise from the dural
covering adjacent to the tentorium cerebelli. Advanced imaging techniques such as computed
tomography (CT) or MR imaging are necessary to aid in accurate diagnosis. The CT and MRI
features of meningiomas have been described (sce Chapter 5). Briefy, they are strongly contrast-
enhancing, well-circumscribed masses that arise from the covering of the brain and, therefore, have a
broad-based appearance (Fig. 9.13). There can often be thickening of the bone adjacent to the

tumor (hyperostosis). Choroid plexus tumors are also strongly contrast enhancing;however, these
the dog. A broad-based, contrast-enhancing rim of tissue, filled with fuid, characterizes these tumors
(Fig. 9.14). Feline intracranial meningiomas are benign growths in that they do not invade sur-
rounding tissue. They are usually well encapsulated and therefore good candidates for surgical
resection (Fig.9.15).When meningiomas extend into the fourth ventricle,they can be more difficult
toremove.
Gliomas are neoplasms that originate from the supporting cells of the CNS (astrocytes and
in a confined spacc (the caudal fosa) compresses surrounding brain structures.They are usually slow
growing, have poorly defined margins, and have a heterogeneously contrast-enhancing patern that
may also have ring enhancement. Oligodendrogliomas are round-cell tumors that invade surround
ing tissue and are highly destructive. The incidence of gliomas is greatest in brachycephalic dogs.
Choroid plexus tumors and ependymal tumors arise within the ventricles. These tissues are
related embryologically and function in the production and movement of CSF Tumors of ependy
mal origin are rare. The fourth ventricle is a common site for choroid plexus tumors. The choroid
plexus is a very vascular tissue and therefore strongly contrast enhances on MR examination. Both of
these tumor types can shed cells into the normal CSF pathways, and therefore a multifocal neuro-
anatomic localization is possible.Metastases of these tumors via CSF pathways are referred to as
"drop” metastascs ("drop mets").
Medulloblastomas are highly metastatic brain tumors, typically occurring in the cerebellum of
dogs and cats, usually between 3 and 10 years of age. These tumors share many characteristics with
thc same tumor type in people. They are classified as primitive neuroectodermal tumors. They arise
from a population of cells thought to be present during the development of the cerebellum. Animals
may present early or later in life with signs of cerebellar disease and possibly signs of brain stem
305

was succcssfully removed.
compression. As the tumors grow into the fourth ventricle, they will often cause obstructive hydro-
cephalus. Tumor cells will invade the adjacent meninges. Metastasis along CSF pathways is also
common.
Epidermoid and dermoidcysts arestructural abnormalities thatmayresultin cerebellar dysfunc
tion. These masses of tissue are not technically classified as neoplasia; however, because of their
location, they create similar clinical signs. It is thought that they arise from an embryological invagi-
nation of neuroectoderm. During embryological development, portions of ectoderm destined to
become skin become entrapped in the closing neural tube. Because the neural canal closes from a
caudal to cranial direction, the fourth ventricle and cerebellomedullary junction is a common site for
these abnormalities. They are present at birth; however, the onset of clinical signs usually occurs later
in life. Because they are invaginations of tissue destined to become skin, they are filled with keratin
and desquamated epithelial cells. They cause cerebellar signs due to the slow compression of sur-
rounding structures.More information on primary brain tumors and epidermoid/dermoid cysts may
be found in Chapter 5.
2. Secondary brain tumors
The CNS is a common site of metastatic tumors. The cerebellum may be affected through
hematogenous spread or spread through the CSF pathways. The extent and nature of cerebellar
dysfunction will be referable to the site of the metastatic tumor (i.e., it may involve other surround-
ing structures). Common mctastatic tumors include mammary adenocarcinoma, prostatic adenocar-
cinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, melanoma, hemangiosarcoma, and
lymphoma.
Tumors of surrounding structures of the CNS may also compress the cerebellum. These include
tumors of the skull, such as osteosarcoma,chondrosarcoma, and multilobular osteochondrosarcoma.
More information regarding secondary brain tumors may be found in Chapter 5.
3.Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration
Although relatively rare in humans, there are multiple reports of paraneoplastic cercbellar
degeneration (PCD) in people, and this is the most common paraneoplastic disorder of this species
that affects the brain. The immunopathogenesis of this phenomenon is complex, but it generally
involves aberrant peripheral (i.e., not CNS) tumor expression of neuronal antigens (usually of
Purkinje cells), antigens that normally are sequestered from the immune system via the blood-brain
barrier. The resultant autoimmune response against these tumor antigens leads to a secondary
autoimmune degeneration of cerebellarneurons (primarilyPurkinje cells).Cerebellar dysfunction in
such cases is typically acute or subacute in onset and precedes detection of an obvious neoplasm in
306
up to two-thirds of cases. A wide variety of tumors have been associated with PCD in people, but
the most commonly reported are small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, breast carcinoma,
and Hodgkins lymphoma. Diagnosis can be very challenging, especially in the absence of a detect-
able neoplasm. Brain imaging is often normal, though evidence of cerebellar degeneration may be
appreciated. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may also be normal, though a mild pleocytosis may be
cvident. Definitive diagnosis depends upon the identification of serum and/or CSF antibodies
directed against specific neuronal antigens (e.g, anti-Yo, anti-Hu antibodies). These antibody tests
are not available for dogs and cats. Though not yet reported in dogs and cats, the possibility of
paraneoplastic cercbellar degcncration should be considered in some paticnts (e.g., older dogs
and cats with obvious cerebellar dysfunction and normal or equivocal brain imaging and CSF
findings).
C.Infectious/infammatory
1.Feline (panleukopenia) and canine parvovirus
One of the most well-rccognized disorders of cerebellar development is the in utero infection of
feline ermbryos with the feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). Kittens infected with FPV either in utero
Infections resulting in clinical signs of cerebellar disease cause inflammation of the brain and destruc
tion of cells in the external germinal layer of the cerebellum.This layer is highly active prior to and
in the first few weeks following birth. This active division leads to the fully functional cerebellum.
Disruption of the division of these cells leads to hypoplasia of the granule cell layer and gross
cerebellar hypoplasia. Purkinje cells that are actively growing may also be affected. Kittens typically
present with a non-progressive, symmetric cerebellar ataxia usually noticed at the onsct of ambula
tion. Occasionally, other areas of the CNS will be affected. With time, most cats will compensate for
paraffinized brain tissue of two dogs with congenital cerebellar hypoplasia has been performed that
implicates the in utero infection of canine parvovirus as a possible cause of the malformation. The
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique has also been successfully performed in cats with
congenital cerebellar hypoplasia.
2. Canine herpes virus
The predilection of clinical signs related to cerebellar dysfunction secondary to viral infection is
likely due to the developmental nature of the tissue affected.The Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum
are exquisitely susceptible to all types of injury. This, when considered with the fact that the granule
cell layer is continuing to develop well into the perinatal time period, provides a plausible explana-
tion as to why clinical signs of cerebellar disease would predominate. Puppies exposed to canine
hcrpes virus cither in utero, during parturition, or within thefirst 2 weeks of life can developa
herpes virus meningoencephalitis that can preferentially affect the cerebellum. Nearly all puppies
with an active infection early in life will succumb to the infection.However, a few will live and have
residual lesions in the CNS. Although other organs may bc affected (lung, kidney, and liver), signs
diferential diagnosis. Surviving puppies may also be affcted with retinal dyslasia, as this tissue is
also undergoing active differentiation at the time of the infection.
3.Canine distemper virus
Canine distemper virus may affect dogs of any age; however, there is a pattern to the destructionn
of nervous system tissue that is age dependcnt. Those dogs affected with the disease early in life
suffer from a polioencephalomyelopathy (gray matter disease), usually have a history of seizures, and
rarely survive.Dogs affected bythe diseaselater inlifemay haverain stem,cerebellar,andvestibu
20
lar signs. They typically have a leukoencephalomyelopathy (white matter disease) or a combination
of gray and white matter disease, and in most cases the disease is less severe. The cerebellar peduncles
are commonly affected; however, distemper virus can affect all segments of the nervous system. A
common sequela of an infection with canine distemper virus is a rhythimic myoclonus of a single
muscle group that may be mistaken for tremors.
4.Feline infectious peritonitis
The pyogranulomatous (dry) form of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP) can affect the CNS
and may result in infammation of the ependyma, choroid plexus, or meninges that surround the
brain stem and junction of the cerebellum and medulla. This disease can be a challenge to diagnose,
as definitive antemortem tests to prove a cat has the disease are virtually nonexistent. In one report,
it was found that a high CSF IgG titer against feline coronavirus (greatcr than 1:25) was predictive
of FIP as a causative entity. However, in a more recent report, CSF IgG titers were not found to be
predictive of FIP, but rather suspected to be nonspecifically derived from the systemic circulation.
Similarly, it is unclear whether or not PCR testing of CSF for coronavirus in cats is predictive of the
existence of CNS-related FIl: It has been reported that over 45% of cats affected with the dry form
of the disease will have signs of CNS dysfunction. This results from an inflammatory response to the
virus and a lack of a protective cell-mediated immune response. Becausc the disease occurs as a
multifocal pyogranulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis in the CNS, the neuroanatomic localization
can be diverse. Various guidelines have been suggested for the clinician to follow in order to make a
presumptive diagnosis. They include history of possible exposure, clinical signs, high CSF coronavi-
ral titers, and concurrent infection with feline leukemia virus. The disease is usually fatal, except in
rare cases.
5. Granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis
Granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME) has been reported as primarily affecting the
cerebellum; however, the condition typically affects multiple areas of the CNS.Three forms of the
discase have been described: thc disseminated (multifocal) form, the focal form, and the ocular form
The disseminatcd form usually has a much more rapid onsct and progression than the focal form.
This disease is typically characterized by a massive perivascular infammatory response consisting of
histiocytes,plasma cells, and lymphocytes,occasionally mixed with other leukocytes.It primarily
affects the white matter, but it can affect the gray matter as well.The condition most commonly
affects young to middle-aged small-breed dogs and has a higher incidence in females than males.
Lesions in the region of the cerebellomedullary angle are cormmon. Affected animals will present
with clinical signs referable to structural discase of the cerebellum (i.e., ataxia, tremors, nystagmus).
The cxtensive accumulations of infammatory cells are at times so proliferative that they compress
surroundingtissue.Antemortem diagnosis of GMEis basedprimarily on demonstrating characteris-
tic contrast-enhancing brain lesions on CT or MRI (Fig. 9.16) and the presence of a mixed, pre-
dominantly mononuclear pleocytosis on CSF examination. Treatment of GME is covered in detail in
Chapter 5. Corticosteroid therapy may relieve clinical signs, but this is often for a short period of
time(weeks to months).When the histiocytes are admixed with inflammatory cells,thc distinction
is one of a nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis. If histiocytes are the predominant monomor-
phic form, then the classification is more akin to neoplasia. It has been suggested that the nonsuppu-
rative form of thc disease may be a form of neoplasia as well. Because the predominant cell types
appear to originate from the monocyte-macrophage cell lines, radiation therapy has been proposed
and has been uscd successfully in the treatment of focal GME.
6.Fungal diseases
All of the commonly encountered mycotic organisms may infect the CNS; however, the most
frequently seen infections are Cryptococcus neoformans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Coccidioides
immitis. They typically result in a diffuse or multifocal meningoencephalitis. The CNS may be
infected through systemic dissemination (i.e.,hematogenously),local extension(e.g.,nasal,frontal

sinuses), migrating foreign bodies (e.g., grass awns), or surgical procedure (iatrogenically). CNS
infections may involve the junction of the cerebellum and the medulla,resulting in cercbellar,
vestibular, and other brain stem signs.Additionally, because of the typical multifocal presentation of
these infections, signs of cerebral and spinal cord involvement may be apparent along with cerebellar
signs. Fluconazole is the treatment of choice. Additional information regarding CNS fungal infec-
tions can be found in Chapter 5.
7.Rickettsial disease
The vasculitis caused by cither Rocky Mountain spotted fever or ehrlichiosis may cause a
meningoencephalitis in dogs. Dogs neurologically infected with a rickettsial disease commonly
present with vestibular dysfunction, usually afer a history of lethargy, depression, and fever. The
hematologic abnormalities secondary to a rickettsial infection or vasculitis may pass without the
owners being aware that the animal was infected. Cerebellovestibular signs may be appreciated in
combination with clinical signs referable to other areas ofinvolvement in the CNS.Rickettsial
diseases are rare in cats. Additional information regarding CNS rickettsial infections can be found in
Chapter 5.
8. Protozoal disease
The nervous system of both dogs and cats may be infected by the coccidian protozoan Toxo-
plasma gondi.Neosporum caninum,a protozoal organism related to Toxoplasmais known to naturally
infect the nervous system of dogs only. These infections typically present as multifocal disease and
are supported by systemic illness. They can infect animals of all ages and breeds. Immunocompro-
9/CEREBELLARDISEASESANDTREMORSYNDROMES
309
mised or immunosuppressed animals are more susceptible to infection. The infections cause necrosis
 and a nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis of both gray and white matter. Infectious foci can form
granulormas, which may result in signs consistent with focal disease. Clinical signs of cerebelloves-
tibular disease would be expected if the lesion caused compression or inflammation of the cerebel-
lun, cerebellar peduncles, or brain stem.
Additional information regarding CNS protozoal infections can be found in Chapter 5.
9.Algal disease
Prototheca wickerhami and Prototheca zopfi are species of ubiquitous algae that have been
reported to cause CNS disease. The disease is rare, and it is thought that an abnormality of the
animal's immune system must contribute to the pathogenesis of the infection. Animals will present
with systemic signs of illness and multifocal neurologic disease, the clinical signs of which will be
dependent upon the area of the nervous system affected. The pyogranulomatous lesions seen in the
brains of dogs with protothecosis may cause signs of cerebelovestibular dysfunction. In one case, an
eosinophilic pleocytosis was reported. The organism has a predilection for the eyes, so ocular changes
may accompany signs of multifocal neurologic disease.
D.Trauma
Trauma to the brain is discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Trauma involving the cerebellum is uncommon
due to the fact that the cerebellum is in a particularly isolated environment. It is almost completely
surrounded by bone. Dense bone surrounds three-fifths of the cerebellum as the cranial vault at the
caudal, lateral, and dorsal aspects. The rostral aspect of the cercbelum is separated from thc ccrebrum by
the partially osseous tentorium (tentorium cerebelli). Additionally, in dogs there is a large mass of muscle
that surrounds the caudal skull.
Trauma to the cerebellum may be divided into primary injuries such as skull fractures, blood vessel
physiological changes, such as increased intracranial pressure, ongoing hemorrhage, ischemia, and
cerebellar edema.In the second class of injuries are the injuries that may benefit from medical or
surgical therapy. Primary cerebellar injuries are irreversible. Of major concern is the decrcase in cerebellar
perfusion secondary to increased intracranial pressure. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum are exqui-
sitely sensitive to ischemic, as well as compressive (edema) injury. There are two types of edema associ-
ated with cerebellar injury. Cytotoxic edema results from the failure of membrane transport systems in
the cell secondary to a decreased production of ATP. Decreased ATP production is due, in turn, to
hypoxia and disruption of the electron transport chain.This cascade of events eventually leads to
accumulation of water and solute in the cells themselves. Vasogenic edema results from the damage to
membranes secondary to free radical production and lipid peroxidation. These damaged membranes
then leak protein and other simall solutes into the interstitial space.In general, vasogenic cdema is more
responsivc to medical therapy than is cytotoxic edema.
Corticosteroid therapy is a focus of great controversy in the treatment of brain trauma. The Brain
Trauma Foundation does not recommend the use of glucocorticoids in people. There is conclusive
evidence that the use of glucocorticoids does not lower intracranial pressure or improve the outcome of
humans with severe head injuries.The beneficial effects of corticosteroids in the treatrment of brain
trauma may be limited to their ability to treat vasogenic edema (edema most commonly associated with
brain tumors and other masses). Unfortunately, the major edema associated with brain trauma is cyto
toxic. The basics of treatment for brain trauma include adequate fuid resuscitation and support, oxygen-
surfacc, rotation), adjunctive treatment (moderate hypothermia, free radical scavengers, etc.), and
surgery,if necessary.The pathophysiology of brain trauma is very complex.Additionalinformation
concerning brain trauma can be found in Chapter 6.

E. Miscellaneous causes of cerebellar disease
1. Lysosomal storage diseases
Lysosomal storage diseases of the CNS represcnt a group of disorders that have in comrnon the
accumulation of metabolic by-products within the periksaryon, axon, dendrites, or surrounding
neuropil. Storage diseases can primarily affect the cerebellum; however, thcy usually are very diffuse
in their localization, affecting multiple areas of the brain and spinal cord. Animals with lysosomal
storagc discases affecting the ccrcbclum will typically present at a young age, due to the fact that
these diseases are congenital. However, there are few reports of animals presenting with signs of
cerebellar disease later in life. Numerous storage discascs may have the potential to affect the cerebel-
lum. A few of the more commonly documented discases are discussed here. More information
concerning lysosormal storage diseases is provided in Chapter 5.
Lafora hodies are polyglucosan deposits within the CNS. They have been associated with discase
of thc CNS in various small animals, including a 4.5-year-old cat that presenred for hcad bobbing
and whole-body trcmors. The Lafora bodies were most numerous in the granule cell layer of the
cerebellum and in Purkinje neurons. Neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis has been most commonly
reported in the dog. A similar condition affects cats. The disease results from intraneuronal accumu-
lations of ceroid-lipofuscin granules, and it can result in gross cerebellar atrophy. It has been related
to primary cerebellar disease in the dog. Dogs with this storage disease will usually present at less
than 1 year old; however, they may not show clinical signs until they marure. Niemann-Pick disease
type C in the cat causes neurologic deterioration and hcpatosplenomegaly. This disease is caused by
an accumulation of sphingomyelin and other lipids in the CNS and reticuloendothelial tissues (e.g,
spleen, liver). Neuroaxonal dystrophy is the primary histologic featurc of the disease. Cats affected. by
this discasc will usually show signs of tremor by 812 weeks. The disease will slowly progresuntil
thc cat is unable to stand. Evcntually, the menace responses may disappear as well. In people, those
children who have the late infantile form (35 years old) have primarily cerebeilar signs. Although
these storage diseases are rare, they should be suspected in young animals that present with slowly
progressing cerebellar signs.
2.Ischemic/vascular
Because of the cerebellum's sensitivity to ischemic changes sccondary to hypoxia, clinical signs of
cerebellar disease may be evident beforc signs related to other areas of the brain following ischemic
cvents. A definitive antemortem diagnosis of cerebellar infarct is usually not possible.With advanced
imaging techniqucs such as MR imaging (Fig. 9.17), however, a presumptive diagnosis can usually
be made by combining imaging resulrs with history, signalment, and results of ancillary diagnostic
tests. Clinical signs of cerebellar disease will typically bc ipsilatcral to the area damaged in the
cerebellum. If the damage to the cerebellum is minor, one would cxpect the animal to have a good
prognosis, with typical improvement in clinical status seen within thc initial 72 hours after the
ischcmic cpisode. Causes of thrombocmbolic disease such as hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism
(athcrosclerosis), bacterial cndocarditis, hearrworm disease, hyperlipidemia, and ncoplasia must be
ruled out as potential causcs. Sporadic cases of post-anesthetic cerebellar dystunction have been
observed. Clinically normal animals undergoing routine anesthetic procedures have been affected
with a cerebellar syndrome. Brachycephalic breeds (e.g., Boston Terriers, Persian cats) may be at a
higher risk of developing this anesthetic-related complication. In a retrospective stuidy involving 11
Persian-cross cats affected with cerebellar signs following routine anesthetic procedures, ketamine was
used in each case. Although there is no direct implication of ketamine, it is hypothesized that a

Pathophysiology and Classification
Tremors in dogs and cats can be caused by a variety of conditions affecting the nervous system.A tremor is
animals. Much of the understanding of the pathophysiology of tremor in humans has been elucidated in the
last 20 years. It is important to remember that many of the experiments that have generated the current
conclusions regarding the pathophysiology of tremors in people were performed on animals. It is diffcult to
categorize tremors of dogs and cats in the same groupings as human tremors. In people, tremors are charac-
terized by their frequency in Hertz (Hz; or cycles per second), the location of the tremor (e.g., fingers, legs,
head, etc.), and the condition in which the tremor occurs (e.g, at rest, standing, goal-oriented behavior,
etc.). The origins of tremors are uncertain.The activity of the brain is intensely rhythmic. Oscillators are
systems that have the ability to produce rhythmic activity.These are not necessarily discrete anatomic
structures.They may likely be neural circuits or connections between subsystems that have an inherent
ability to function in this manner. Neurons have the ability to resonate and set up oscillatory firing. The
subcortical oscillations of neurons occur through electrical coupling via gap junctions. These neurons
resonate at 7-10 Hz, which is the typical range for physiologic tremors.
There are four basic modes of tremor genesis in humans.First, mechanical tremor is due to the reso-
nance frequency of the activated muscle,which can be changed based on the load against themuscle

APRACTICAL GUIDETO CANINEAND FELINENEUROLOGY
example, when a limb is extended, there are impulses that allow the antagonistic muscle to cause fexion.
to cause extension (this is a compon
nt of fuidity of movement). The muscles will have synchronized
frequency peaks that are cquivalent to the frcquency of the portion of the limb that generates that move-
ment. Third, in central oscillation, trcmors occur either through the rhythmic activity of a group of neurons
in a nucleus (the electro-tonic coupling of oscillatory activity through gap junctions) or through oscilations
created by neural circuits between different nuclei or different populations of neurons. Fourth, is trcmor
that is the result of malfunction of feedforward loops. This occurs within the CNS and mosr commonly in
the cerebellum. It is commonly recognized as intention tremor. In this case, a deficit of cerebellar function
causes a delay of the antagonistic movement, which results in a decreased braking of a ballistic movement
and an overshoot movement. Compensation then leads to a correction movement, which causes hypermetria
in the opposite direction. Eventually, the abnormality will crcate an oscillatory movement that is intensifed
during goal-oricnted behavior.
The following will be a classification of tremors in. animals based on current human classifications,
realizing that certain descriptivc aspects and therefore classifications arc not possible in animals. By exclud-
reported occurrence in animals (e.g., Parkinsonian tremors), we may limit the futurc identification of animal
models of tremors.‘Therefore, although specific examples of tremors in animals that arc recognized in
humans may not be discussed (because we have not documcnred them), the categories will hc mentioned
noetheless.
Tremors can be divided into two broad categories: physiologic tremors and pathologic tremors. Patho-
logic tremors are those that impair motor function. Physiologic tremors are present in norimal animals at a
low-amplitude movement that is diffcult to discern with the naked eye. Therc arc three components to a
systole, referred to as the balistocardiogram. The mechanical component may be augmented by sympathetic
refexes (e.g, epinephrine enhancement of muscle spindle activation). Finally, a ccntral component is
hypothesized, wherein synchronization of motor neurons by the brain is responsible for the amplification of
at as “physiological tremor of pathological amplitude” is known as cnhanced physiological tremor. These
tremors are an exaggeration of the normal physiological tremor and may be caused by merabolic abnormali-
ties (electrolyte disturbances, hypoglyccmia, etc.), stress, exercise, certain medications (e.g., metoclopramide,
diphenhydramine, etc.), and toxins (c.g., lead, organophosphates, etc.).
The pathologic tremors consist of cerebellar tremors, Parkinsonian tremors, Holmcs's tremor (formerly
known as rubral or midbrain tremors), tremors due to peripheral nervous system disorders (e.g., neuropa-
thies, myopathies, junctionopathies), dystonic tremors, palatal temors, orthostatic tremors, and psychogenic
trermors. Cerebellar tremors (intention tremors) were discussed previously and may result from any pathol-
ogy that affects cerebellar function. They have been associated with lesions involving the lateral cerebellar
hemispheres, the vermis, and the interposital nucleus. These tremors wilf be bilaterally symmetric if due to a
toxin or dcgcncrative condition that affects the cerebellum and ipsilateral to specific lesions of the cerebel-
lum such as an infarct or neoplasia. Cerebellar tremors can be presumed when there are other signs of
cerebellar dysfunction (c.g., ataxia, nystagmus). Parkinsonian remors are specifically due to an abnormaliy
in the synthesis of the neurotransmittcr dopamine. These tremors are duc to alterations in the circuitry of
the basal nuclei motor loop. Dopamine plays a very important role in the proper function of this motor
cells in the midbrain responsible for the synthesis of dopamine. Terminal fields of the substantia nigra are
located in the caudate nucleus and globus pallicdus, where dopamine exers some of its major effects. This
degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway is also seen in horses that ingest the toxic wceds yellow star thistlc
(Centaurea solstitialis) and Russian knapweed (Centaurea repans). This particular type of tremor has not been
recognized in dogs or cats.
9/ CEREBELLARDISEASESANDTREMORSYNDROMES

Holmes's tremor is a combination of cerebellar tremor and basal nuclei tremor. They rmay result from
lesions in the cerebellum/midbrain and thalamus. These tremors have an erratic, uneven appearance with a
relatively low frequency (less than 4.5 Hz). They are often the result of Icsions of the cerebellar outfow
pathways. In people, there is a delay between lesion onset and activation of the trcmor of four wecks to two
years.
Disorders of thc pcripheral nervous system, especially those resulting in demyelination, may cause
tremors. These can have an insidious onset and may result from congenitral, inherited, metabolic, toxic, and
inflammatory etiologies. Dystonic tremors involve muscles affected by abnoral muscle tone; however, it is
thought that the origination of thc trcmor in people is in the basal nuclei.These tremors are typically focal,
high-frequency (less than 7 Hz), and of inconsistent arnplitude. A rhythmic oscillation of the soft palate in
people is a rare condirion known as palatal remor. This condition is known to occur with abnormnalities of thc
inferior (caudal) olivary nucleus. It develops seconcdary to lesions in the cercbello-olivary projcction from thc
cerebellum to the contralateral olivary nucleus via the supcrior (rostral) cerebellar pedunclc. The lesion causes
a disinhibition. of the inferior (caudal) olive neurons, which become electronically coupled via gap junctions.
It has not been recognized in dogs or cats. Orthostatic tremor is a form of postural tremor reported in people
as a sensation of unsteadiness or quivcring when standing up. This tremor is a fine tremor (approxinately 13-
16 Hz) of the legs and is only apparent when standing. It is hypothesized that this tremor disorder originates
 isn  e  (r s e  n  s   
regulating stance or muscle tone. There is an animal model of this disorder in pigs. Most recently, orthostatic
tremor has been described in young, giant breed dogs, most norably Great Danes and Mastiff. This disorder
is described in more detail under postural tremors (section ll E below). The condition referred to as myokymia
is characterized by episodic wavelike undulations of the skin, due to contractions of smallsubcutaneous
muscle fbers. This novement has also been described as “rippling” and “vermicular” (wormlilkc) and may
appear clinically as a form of tremor. Myokymia is probably a manifestation of a more inclusive disorder called
neuromyotonia,Neuromyotonia refers to episodic muscle contraction secondary to hyperexcitabilitry ofmotor
nerve axons. Myokyimia/neuromyotonia is discussed in more detail in Chapter 15.
In people, several crireria must be met before a diagnosis of psychogenic tremor can be made. Essen
tially, it is a tremor generated as voluntary movement that requires litte attention to be maintained. The
trermor may be associated with clonus of the affected body part.'I'he amplitude of a hand tremor will
usually decrease when a load (weight) is applied to the hand. With psychogenic tremor, the amplitude of
the tremor increases when a load is applied. This is interpretcd as ncccssary co-activation of the muscles in
order to maintain the reffex activity that generates the tremor. Other clinical signs of psychogenic trcmor in
people include a history of somatization, which is multiple physical complaints that suggest a physical
disorder without any physical impairment to account for them; the sudden onset of the condition or
remission of the condition; other unrelated. neurologic signs; and a decrease in the treinor amplitude or
frequency when the subject is distractcd or performing rnovements of the contralateral hand. Obviously,
from this description, it is unlikely that this tremor disorder exists in animals. Many of the tremor classifica-
tions described above have not been recognized in animals. It is hoped that with a better understanding of
tremor disordcrs (through those documented in humans), we may better recognize thc abnormalitics in
animals. Based on frequency and circunstance (resting, posture, or intention), a general neuroanatomic
localization may be made.

Tremor Disorders in Dogs and Cats
A. Hypomyelination/dysmyelination (dysmyelinogenesis)
but rarely in the cat. The condition is known to affecr the Chow Chow, Weimaraner, Bernese Mountain
Dog, Samoyed, Springer Spaniel, Dalmatian, Lurcher, mixed brceds, and the Siamese cat. In the majority of
congenital tremor syndrormes attributable to disorders of myelin formation, thc defect is confined to the
CNS. Peripheral nerves are unaffected. This discrepancy most likely arises from thc difference in the cells
314
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TOCANINEAND FELINENEUROLOGY
for the myelination of many axons within the brain and spinal cord. Once the axons lcave the CNS, the
Schwann cell takes over the responsibility of myelination; however, a single Schwann cell will only myelinate
 singlc axon. Dysmyelination, stricly defined, refers to decreased myelination due to an abnormality of the
myelin itself. Hypomyelination implies that the myelin is biochemically norinal but present in decreased
amounts. In almost all cases studied, the clinical signs appear within the first several weeks of age; however,
cases of delayed onset have also been described.
In the recessive X-linked hypomyelination disorder of Springer Spaniels (“shaking pups"), a severe
generalized tremor is first appreciated in the second week of life in affected male dogs. These dogs are
unable to stand or walk, and do not improve over time. Femalc carriers of the dlefective gene rmay display a
mild generalized tremor during the second week of life, which resolves by 4-6 weeks of age. Dogs with this
disorder may develop seizure activity as they maturc. The Samoyed breed is affccted with a hypomyelination
disorder very similar to that of the Springer Spanicl dogs. Other breeds with hypomyclination/dysmyelin-
ation disorders tend to have less-severe clinical syndromes, in comparison wich Springer Spaniels and
Samoycds. In thcse brceds, thc disordcr is suspected to be inherited as an altosornal recessive trait, with
incomplete penetrance. Clinical signs of dysfunction often plarcau berween 6 and 8 months in these anirmals
and then gradually dissipate. The remoring resolves in many such cases at approximately I year of age.
that worsens with excitement and exercise and resolves with sleep, a “rocking horsc” stance, and a bunny-
hopping gair when ambulating (in those dogs able to do so). Histologicaly, the abnormalities appcar to
have a somcwhat consistent involvement of the ventral and lateral columns of the spinal cord white matter,
In somc cascs, there are normal numhers of oligodendrocytes, and in others there are altered ratios of
or the functional cause of the myelin abnormality. Numerous hypotheses have been postulated as to the
tion, defects in oligodendrocyte metabolism, and alterations in the genctic code (mutations) responsible for
proteins required for normal oligodendrocyte or myclin function. The ctiology is likely different for each
separate clinical syndrome. Most current rescarch focuses on specific proteins neccssary for the normal
architectural stability of myelin and terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes. It is important to remem-
ber when prescntcd with an animal thar is suspected of a congenital tremor syndrome thar numcrous
ctiologics may account for thc disordcr: These include infectious/infammatory agents, inherent abnormali-
ties of metabolism, or genetic mutation. Animals affected with congenital hypomyelination or dysmyelin-
ation may improve with age and lead acceptable lives.
B. Central axonopathy of Scorttish Terriers
A tremor syndrome has been described in three Scottish Terricr puppies. The etiology of this disorder is
unknown. Axonal loss was evident throughout the CNS upon histopathologic examination. The affected
dogs developed severe generalized tremors and ataxia at 10-12 weeks of age. Two of the three dogs were
paraparetic. The clinical signs worsened with cxercise and exciterment and abated with rest or sleep. The
disorder is felt to be progressive and is associated with a poor prognosis.
C. Corticosteroid responsive tremor syndrome
Corricosteroid responsive tremor syndrome (CRTS) is a wcll-rccognized, fairly common disorder. Although
white dogs (e.g., Maltese, West Highland White Terricr) appear ro he overrepresented, the term “white
shaker dog” syndrome is misleading. Approximately onc-half of dogs with CRTS do not have white coat
coloring. Most dogs affected with this generalizcd tremor syndrome are young (lcss than 5 years old), and
most weigh less than 15 kg. The prevailing clinical sign of dysfunction in CRTS is a fine, whole-body
tremor; other reported signs of neurologic dysfunction include decreased menace responses, head tilt,
nystagmus, paraparcsis, tetraparesis, ataxia, and seizure activity. Dogs with CRTS ocasionally havc slightly
315
immunosuppressive dosages of coricosteroids. In one report, 80% of affected dogs responded to immuno-
suppressive corticosteroid therapy within 3 days. The condition can be separated from other inflammatory
causes on the basis of CSF examination. This syndrome is characterized by a minimal to moderatc nonsup-
purative (i.e., lymphocytic) pleocytosis, in contrast to the polymorphonuclear pleocytosis associated with
mycotic and bacterial infections and the mixed-cell pleocytosis typical of granulomatous meningoencephali-
tis and protozoal diseases. Cerebrospinal fuid white blood cell counts are often normal (sometimes with
abnormal distribution of cell types) or mildly elevated (typically mononuclear pleocytosis). Histologically,
mild perivascular cuffing and lymphocytic infiltrates throughout the CNS (i.e., mild, diffuse meningoen-
cephalomyelitis), especially in the cerebellum, characterize CRTS.It is thought that CRTS may represent an
autoimmunedisorder.
Prognosis for treatment of this disease with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids is excellent.
Dosages of prednisone may range from I to 2 mg/kg body weight, every 12 hours. Once clinical signs have
resolved, the corticosteroid therapy should be gradually discontinued over a l- to 3-month time pcriod.
Occasionally, dogs may need to be kept on low doses or alternate-day therapy to control the trcmors. Some
dogs with CRTS benefit from adjunctive oral diazepam therapy (0.2 mg/kg body weight, q 8 hr).
D. Tremorgenic toxins
Numerous toxins are known to either influence cerebellar function rcsulting in tremors or produce tremors
as one of the clinical manifestations of the toxic exposure. Mechanisms of toxin exposure include accidental
ingestion, dermal contact, and iatrogenic administration (medications). The mechanisms for the generation
of tremors secondary to toxin exposure are not all known. Hexachlorophene, a germicide present in disin-
fectant solutions, soaps, and shampoos, may produce spongy degeneration of the white matter in the brain,
spinal cord, and cerebellum. The ingestion of moldy food containing the mycotoxins penitrerm A and
roquefortine, produced by Penicillium species, may cause clinical signs of ataxia, tremors, and far-off gaze
(staring), possibly due to halucinations. Organophosphates and pyrethrins/pyrethroids (fea collars, dips),
of tremors in dogs and cats. Less common are 5-fuorouracil (chemotherapeutic), macadamia nut ingestion,
theobromine (chocolate),and strychnine.A single case ofKentucky coffee tree seed ingestion has been
implicated in causing cerebellovestibular signs, including intention tremor in a dog.Many of these toxicants
will have other concurrent neurological signs such as seizures and ataxia. Treatment may be specific for the
underlying causc or generalized decontainination. Prognosis is variable. More information regarding these
toxicitics can be found in Chapter 20.
E.Postural Tremors
There are a number of enigmatic tremor syndromes described in dogs that are associated with maintaining
the tremoring body part(s) against gravity. These disorders can be confusing because they are all of unknown
andprobably disparate etiologies, and each disorder has multiple terms to describe it. One thing that all of
these disorders havein common is their relatively innocuous nature.
Orthostatic tremor (OT), also called primary orthostatic tremor and orthostatic postural myoclonus tremor,
has been described in young (12 years old at onset) adult giant-brecd dogs, including Great Danes, Mas-
tiffs, and one Scottish Deerhound. Thesc dogs exhibited tremors of all four limbs while standing, which
appeared as a constant “quivering” or “shivering" of the limbs. On close inspection of limb muscles, fine
rippling of the musculature was apparent while the dogs were standing. Less commonly, facial and head
to limb and have difficulty lying down from a standing position. The tremors disappear when affected dogs
are recumbent, while walking or running, when leaning against objects, or when picked up (to remove all
weight support). When a dog with OT is in lateral recumbency, if an examiner pushes against a paw
(causing isometric limb muscle contraction),the tremor can be induced. These dogs do not demonstrate
fatigability with exercise, and no deficits are apparent on neurologic cxamination. Blood work (including
lactate, pyruvate, creatinine kinase, acetylcholine receptor antibody concentration), brain MR imaging, CSF
316
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
examination, motor and sensory nerve conduction studies, repetitive nerve stimulation, electrocncephalogra-
phy (EEG), electromyographic (EMG) examination under anesthesia (with a concentric needle elcctrode),
and nerve/muscle biopsies have all been normal in the dogs in which these tests were performed. During
auscultation with a stethoscope over an affected muscle during weight bearing, a characteristic low-pitched
repetitive noise (tremor) is heard, which sounds like a distant helicopter. Surface EMG recordings taken
while thcse dogs wcre fully awake and standing demonstrated a characteristic continuous muscle discharge
with a frequency of 13-16 Hiz, which occurs concomitantly with the visible tremors during the recordings.
The clinical characteristics of caninc OT fit very well with those of human OT, which was briefly discussed
earlier in this chapter. This disorder appears to be very slowly progressive in dogs and also tends to respond
to oral phenobarbital therapy. Other suggested treatments for people with OT include gabapentin and
clonazepam. Clonazepam is actually the preferred drug choice for people, but it is probably ill-advised for
caninc usc duc to the rapid development of drug tolerance to this drug in dogs.
Older dogs, espccially terrier breeds, occasionally dcvclop a rapid tremor of the pelvic limbs (while stand-
tremor may also worsen during excitcmcnt and following exercise and tends to disappear as the dog ambulates
and during recumbency Though the pathophysiology of this disorder is unknown, it may involve an age-
related dysfunction of the stretch mechanism. Other terms for this condition include cssential tremor, senile
tremor, and benign postural myoclonus tremor. No treatment is recommended for this tremor syndromc.
Repetitive, intermittent head bobbing (vertical or horizontal) is a poorly understood movcmcnt disorder
which is often encountered in dogs, particularly young adult Boxer dogs, English and French Bulldogs, and
Doberman Pinschers. This is also a benign condition for which the underlying mechanism remains elusive.
Among the posibilities for causes of this disorder is a potentially heritable disorder of the stretch mecha-
nism affecting thc neck musculature. As with other postural tremors, the tremors tend to subside if the head
is supported (i.e., not supported by neck muscles). The tremors also tcnd to stop if the dog is distracted
(e.g., calling patient's name, offering a toy or food). Neurologic exanination is characteristically normal, as
are diagnostic tests (including brain imaging and CSF examination). This is typically a non-progressive
disorder and does not adversely affect quality of life in affected dogs. Other terms for this condition include
head-bobber, postural repetitive myoclonus, and essential tremor (a term also used for pelvic limb tremors in
aged dogs). 'This disorder is also discussed in Chapter 7.

MYELOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE SPINAL CORD
Curtis W. Dewey
1.
Clinical Signs of Spinal Cord Dysfunction
The clinical signs associated with spinal cord dysfunction depend upon the location, size, and rate of
development of the lesion. A small lesion on one side of the spinal cord without a great deal of associated
cord swelling (e.g., a slowly growing tumor) will likely cause signs predorminantly on che side of the lesion.
However, a large lesion or a lesion associated with substantial cord swelling (e.g., al acute disk herniation in
the thoracolumbar region), will likely result in bilateral signs of dysfunction. In most spinal cord disorders,
bilateral deficits will be observed, but the deficits are often more pronounced on the side of the lesion.
Proprioceptive and nociceptive information traveling toward thc brain, as well as voluntary motor impulses
traveling from the brain, can be affected with spinal cord discase. With progressive spinal cord disease,
proprioception is usually the fist deficit observed, followed by deficits in voluntary motor abiliry and finally
deficits in the ability to perceive painful stimuli (nociception).
The clinical signs listed hclow for cach of the anatomic subdivisions of the spinal cord represent all of
the possible abnormalities that may be encountered with lesions in thesc respective areas. The clinician may
for example, encounrer cases of cervical myelopathy in which scvcrc neck pain is the only clinically dctect-
able ahnormality. Alternatively, cases may be encountered with more extensive Jesions in the same anatomic
location in which the patient is tetraplegic, with minimal pain perception to the limbs and respiratory
difficulty. There is a spcctrum of possible clinical prcsentations between these two extreme examples. A topic
that is somctimes confusing to clinicians is that of UMN fecal incontinence. Although it is apparently less
common than with cauda equina lesions (see Chapter 1l), fecal incontinience may result from cervical or
thoracolumbar spina! cord lesions (particularly dorsal lesions, commonly of a cystic nature). This may be
due to interruption of ascending information from the rectuin to brain stem and cerebral centers responsible
for a normal, coordinated defecation rcflex, interruption of descending inhibitory influence from such
centers on the local spinal cord sacral defecation reflex, or a combination of the two. Sincc fecal inconri
nence in these cases does not directly involve the lower motor neuron (LMNs) innervating the anal sphinc
ter musculature or the sensory neurons or nerves innervating the perineum, perincal sensation (in patients
with intacr pain scnsation), as well as anal sphincter tone and perineal reflexes (e.g., anal reflex), are typically
normal. The clinical information regarding upper motor neuron (UMN) fecal incontinence in veterinary
patients is limited, but it suggests that it may be more responsive to surgical intervention than LMN fecal
incontinence.5356.9 In this text, the cauda cquina is defined as the nerve roots derived from the cord seg-
ments L7 aund caudally. Damage to the spinal cord segments supplying the cauda equina will produce the
same clinical signs of dysfunction as disruption of the respective nerve roots. Disorders of the cauda equina
with spinal cord disease are discussed in Chapter 17. Neuronopathies, although technically disorders of thc
spinal cord, appear clinically as neuropathies these disorders are discussed in Chapter 14. Tetanus is also
technically a spinal cord disorder. Because the sustained musclc rigidity characteristic of tetanus more closely
tesembles a myopathy than a myelopathy, it is discussed in Chapter 15. Finally, the important subject of
spinal trauma will not be covered in this chapter; rathcr, there is a separate chapter (Chapter 12) devoted t0
the subject of spinal trauma in dogs and cats.
A. C1C5 spinal cord segments
1.Cervical pain (hypercsthesia).
2.Proprioceptive deficits ipsilateral to the lesion (thoracic limb and pclvic limb) or all four limbs.

3. Voluntary motor deficits ipsilateral to the lesion (thoracic limb and pelvic limb) or all four limbs,
gia) is UMN in nature, with normal to hyperactive refex activity in all limbs.
4.Horner's syndrome ipsilateral to the lesion or bilateral.
5. Respiratory difficulty (severe lesions) involving both chest excursions and diaphragmatic
movements.
6.UMN bladder dysfunction (see Chapter 13).
7. UMN fecal incontinence possible.
8. Nociceptive (pain perception) deficits possible in all four limbs
B. C6--T2 spinal cord segments
1.Cervical pain (hyperesthesia).
2.Proprioceptive deficits ipsilateral to the lesion (thoracic limb and pelvic limb) or all four limbs.
3. Voluntary motor deficits ipsilateral to the lesion (thoracic limb and pelvic limb) or all four limbs,
varying from paresis to plegia. The paresis or plegia is classically LMN in nature in the thoracic
limbs (involvement of the gray matter of C6-T2 or the efferent axonal processes from that gray
matter) and UMN in nature in the pelvic limbs. In some instances (e.g., caudal cervical spondylo-
myelopathy), caudal cervical lesions may result in obvious signs of UMN paraparesis, with subtle or
clinically inapparent thoracic limb deficits.
4.Horner's syndrome ipsilateral to the lesion or bilateral.
5.Decreased or absent cutaneous trunci (panniculus) reflex ipsilateral to the lesion or bilateral. The
deficit is due to impairment of the efferent arm of the reflex arc.
6. Respiratory diffculty with severe lesions. The respiratory pattern often differs from that sen with
C1-C5 spinal cord lesions. Since the phrenic nerve arises from spinal cord segments C5-C7, there is
usually enough phrenic nerve function to provide diaphragmatic movement, but impulses from the
medullary respiratory centers can't effectively traverse the damaged cord segments to stimulate the
cell bodies of the intercostal nerves. This is the reason for the “abdominal breathing” pattern seen
with severe caudal cervical myelopathies. The thoracic cage moves minimall, if at all, and the
cxaggerated activity of the diaphragm causes the abdominal contents to move passively.
7.UMN bladder dysfunction (see Chapter 13).
8.UMN fecal incontinence possible.
9.Nociceptive deficits possible in all four limbs.
C. T3--L3 spinal cord segments
1.Thoracolumbar pain (hypcrcsthesia).
2.Proprioceptive deficits in the pelvic limb ipsilateral to the lesion or both pelvic limbs.
3.Voluntary motor deficits in the pelvic limb ipsilateral to thc lesion or both pelvic limbs. The paresis
hyperactive refex activity in the pelvic limbs.
4. The thoracic limbs neurologically normal (normal proprioception, normal voluntary motor activity).
Schiff-Sherrington posture may be seen in the thoracic limbs (see Chapter 2) and should not be
confused with a cervical spinal cord problem. Schiff-Sherrington posture is an anatomic phenom-
enon, not a prognostic indicator. Depending on the nature of the injury, spinal shock is also a
possibility (see Chapter 3).
5. Horner's syndrome possible with very cranial lesions (T3 spinal cord level), but less likely in com-
parison with cervical lesions.
6. Decreased or absent cutaneous trunci (panniculus) refex, approximately one to four vertebral levels
caudal to the spinal cord lesion. The deficit is due to impairment of the afferent arm of the refex
arc.
7. UMN bladder dysfunction (see Chapter 13).

2. Proprioceptive deficits in the pelvic limb ipsilateral to the lesion or in both pelvic lirmbs.
3.Voluntary rnotor deficits in the pelvic limb ipsilateral to the lesion or both pelvic limbs. The paresis
Or plegia (monoparesis, monoplegia, paraparesis, paraplegia) is IMN in nature, with a decreased to
abscnt patellar reflex ipsilateral to the lesion or bilateral. The withdrawal and gastrocnemius reflexcs
may be normal or decreased, dcpending on the extent of damage to the I6 spinal segment (L6
contributes to the sciatic nerve).
4. Decreased or absent panniculus (cutaneous trunci) reflex possibly appreciable one to four vertebral
levels caudal to the lesion, because the last three or four lumbar spinal nerves do not give off dorsal
cutaneous branches.

a.Dcgcnerative disk disease is a common problem in dogs, but a relatively infrequent clinical
disorder in cats. The anatomy associated with both normal and extruded intervertebral disks is
illustrated in Fig. 10.1. There are wo basic types of disk degeneration, referred to as chondroid
and fibroid degeneration. 'These two types of degeneration typically cause two distinct types of
disk disease. In chondroid degeneration, the normally gelatinous nucleus pulposus loses water-
binding capacity, undergoes degradation of the glycosaminoglycan components, and often
becomes calcified. The dorsal annulus often weakens, and the abnormal nucleus pulposus
contents extrude through the weakened annulus into the vertebral canal. This type of disk disease
is called Hansen rype I, or simply type I, disk extrusion. The severity of spinal cord damagc
caused by type I disk extrusion is believed to be related to the rate of extrusion (force of impact
Or concussion), duration of compression, and amount of disk material extruded. Fibroid degen-
eration involves a progressive thickening of the dorsal annulus fibrosus, which protrudes dorsally
protrusion.
b. Clinical features of both typcs of disk disease are listed below:
(1) Hansen type I extrusions typically occur in small-breed dogs, particuarly the chondrodystro-
phic breeds (Dachshund, Beagle, Bassett Hound, Shih Tzu, Pekingese, Lhasa Apso, etc.). The
Dachshund is by far the most commonly affected breed. Within the Dachshund breed,
certain physical characteristics (e.g., short T1-Sl and TC-PT [tuber calcaneus to mid-
patellar tendon] distances) have been correlated with increased likelihood of disk extrusion.
Hansen type II disk protrusions typically occur in nonchondrodystrophic, larger-breed dogs.

Either type of disk discase may occur in any breed of dog, however, and both types have been
reported in cats. In one report of thoracolumbar disk disease in large (more than 15 kg)
nonchondrodystrophic dogs, 92% of the cases were found to have type I disk extrusions.
Large dog breeds that seem tobe most commonly encountered with type I disk extrusions
include mixed-breed,German Shephcrd dog,Labrador Retrievers,Doberman Pinscher, and
Rottweiler.

(3) Hansen type I disk extrusion usually causes rapidly developing clinical signs (minutes to
days), whereas Hansen type I disk protrusions typically cause chronically developing clinical
signs (weeks to months, sometimes years).
(4) Both types of disk disease may affect cervical, caudal thoracic, and lumbar disks. In small-
breed dogs, type I cervical disk disease usually affects cranial cervical disks (C2-C3 most
commonly), and typically causes severe neck pain, usually with inapparent or mild neurologic
deficits. In large nonchondrodystrophic dogs, the most common site for type I cervical disk
extrusions is at the C6-C7intervertebral disk space; these dogs also tend to present with
acute onset of severe neck pain. The patient often adopts a“nose-down” posture with an
arched back (Fig. 10.2). When turning, these dogs tend to move the head and the neck as
one unit, rather than bending at the neck.Fasciculations of the neck musculature can often
be appreciated, especially upon palpation of the neck. Occasionally, these dogs will scream in
apparent pain and fallver.This may bemistaken for seizure activity by the owner. ameness
of one thoracic limb, referred to as root signature is exhibited sometimes and is thought to be
caused by irritation of cervical nerve roots by laterally extruded disk material.Pelvic limb
root signature is less commonly encountered. In many cases of root signature, the abnormal
limb will be held in a fexed position, and caudal extension of that limb elicits a painful
response (presumably due to stretching of irritated nerve roots).
Type II cervical disk disease may result in clinically appreciable neck pain, but rarely to
causes slowly progressive paresis. This can occur as an isolated process or as a component of
caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy (discussed later in this chapter).
(5) Disk disease in the thoracolumbar region is more frequently encountered than cervical disk
disease. Disk problems cranial to the T10-T11 disk space are uncommon, probably due to
the stabilizing influence of the intercapital ligament. This ligament passes over the dorsal
annulus from rib head to rib head in all but the first pair and last two pairs of ribs. Type I
disk extrusions usually occur between vertebral levels T11 and L3. The T12-T13 and T13-
L1 disks are the most common sites for type I disk extrusions to occur in small-breed dogs.
 In larger dogs, the L1-L2 and L2-L3 disk spaces are the most common sites for type I
extrusions. The L4-L5 intervertebral disk space appears to be the most common site for
thoracolumbar disk extrusion in cats.
While patients with signs of back pain with minimal to no neurologic deficits are
occasionally encountered, type I thoracolumbar disk extrusions more typically result in acute
paraparesis or paraplegia (Fig. 10.3). This may be due to the limited epidural space in the
thoracolumbar vertebral canal, as compared to the cervical region.These patients often
protrusions typically cause progressive signs of paraparesis, often with some degree of back

 Diagnosis of disk disease is based upon signalment, history, clinical signs, and results of diagnos-
tic tests such as cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) analysis, and imaging of the spine. Traditional spinal
phy, both performed under general anesthesia (Fig. 10.4). Computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have been found to be useful imaging modalities in the
diagnosis of intervertebral disk disease (Fig. 10.5). In some instances (e.g., lateralized type I

extrusions), CT or MR imaging may be preferred (Fig. 10.6). Magnetic resonance imaging is
rapidly becoming a standard imaging modality for dogs and cats with suspected intervertebral
disk disease. In addition to providing superior anatomic detail in disk disease patients compared
with myelography and CT, MR imaging is the best modality for diagnosing other spinal disor-
ders that may have clinical presentations similar to intervertebral disk disease and is associated
with fewer side effects than myelography. Normally, the nucleus pulposus has high signal inten-
sity on T2-weighted images (the annulus is hypointense). The nucleus pulposus of a degenerative
disk is hypointense, and the distinction bctween the nuclcus and annulus fibrosus may be lost.
The decision of what diagnostic tests (if any) to perform for an individual case usually depends
on the expected treatment protocol for that patient. For example, a young Dachshund with acute
onsct of neck pain and no neurologic deficits is likely to have a type I cervical disk extrusion and
illogical to anesthetize this patient and perform spinal imaging to confirm the most likely
diagnosis if surgical therapy is not the treatment protocol of choice at that time.
10 / MYELOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE SPINAL CORD
L.EE
1'he typical myelographic (or CT/MR) finding in disk extrusion/protrusion is focal extradu
ral spinal cord compression centered over a disk space. Sometimes, a disk extrusion will lacerate a
venous sinus, leading to largc extradural accumulations of hemorrhage (in addition to disk
material), which can cause extensive cord com
and/or swelling. Occasionally, a type I
disk extrusion will be lateral enough that myelograp
phic results are normal: In such lateralized
extrusions, hyperesthesia with or without unilateral limb lameness (ipsilateral to the extrusion)
are more likely clinical signs of dysfunction than overt
roprioceptive or voluntary motor deficirs.
Another important consideration in such a clinical scenario is the presence of syringomyelia,
which is usually not evident on myelography (requires MR imaging). In some cases of high-
velocity concussive disk-related injury, there can bc scvcre motor deficits (duc to a small amount
of rapidly extruding disk material) with minimal evidence of extradural coinpression on imaging
studies; in such cases, there is typically cvidence of spinal cord swelling. This may be diffcult to
distinguish from a vascular event (see fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy discussion below) if
an imaging modality other then MR is used. There are several reports of intramedullary disk
exrrusions (two dogs, one cat). In this scenario, nuclear material extrudes with cnough forcc to
penerrate the meninges and enter the spinal cord. A charactcristic MR imaging featurc in such a
case is a linear tract extending from the affected disk space into thc spinal cord.
d.Trcatmcnt of acute and chronic disk disease is a subject of considerable debate, but there are a
number of cstablished guidelines. The guidelines center around whether or not to include
with surgical and nonsurgical management of disk disease patients, and the clients need to be
informed of the benefits and risks associated with either approach.
Patients with suspected type I cervical or thoracolurmbar disk extrusions are often successfully
treated nonsurgically initially if they exhibit mild to no neurologic deficits (i.e., mainly neck or
back pain) and have not had repeated episodes of pain. Medical management tradirionally
consists of strict cage confinement for 3-4 weeks, with or without. anti-inflammatory medication.
Thc cage or crate should be of such size that thc patient can changc posirions, but cannot walk
around or jump. Activity should be restricted-to short walks to urinate/defecare, ar which times
the owner can asscss the progress of the patient. If the patient fails to improve or worsens at any
time during the confinement period, surgical options should be pursued. If necessary, it is
acceptable to administer an anti-infammatory dose of prednisone in a decreasing regimen, such
as the following:
(1) 0.5 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hr, for 5.7 days.
(2) 0.5 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hr, every other day, (i.e., skip a day) for the following 5-7 days.
(3) 0.5 rmg/kg, PO, q 48 hr, for the final 5-7 days.
It is unacceptable to administer anti-inflaminatory drugs to a patient exhibiting signs of an
extruded disk without concurrenuly confining that patient. The anti-inflammatory drugs alleviate
thc patient's pain, and most dogs will subsequently bccomc morc active. Incrcased activity is
thought to cause more pressure to be placed on the abnormal disk by the adjacent vertebrae;
subsequently, more disk material is extruded into the vertebral canal, and clinical signs acutely
worsen. It is also unacceptable to concurrently administer steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-
inflarmmatory drugs (NSAIDs) to disk disease patients, as this combination increases the chanccs
of severe gastrointestinal complications. It is inportanr ro realize that subclinical gastroduodenal
ulceration is likely to be present in dogs with type I disk cxtrusions, cven without thc adminis-
tration of potentially ulcerogenic drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, glucocorticoids), so the use of such drugs
should be minimized if at all possible.
The rraditional recommendations for mcdical management of dogs with type I disk extru-
sions havc reccntly been called into question, especially the recomimiendations dealing with cage
confinement and glucocorticoid administration. In two retrospective reports evaluating medical
332
APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
sions, one on thoracolumbar disk extrusions), no association was found between duration of cage
confinement and success of medical therapy. In addition, there was no beneficial effect of
negative effect of glucocorticoid administration on success in the thoracolumbar cxtrusion group
of dogs. However, the use of NSAIDs was positively associated with successful outcome in the
dogs with cervical disk extrusions. These findings suggest both that an extended cage confine-
ment recommendation is often not adhered to by dog owners and that it may be an excessive
recommendation in the first place. In the retrospective studies discussed, the average confinement
period was approximately 2 weeks, which may be a more realistic recommendation. In addition
to anti-inflammatory medications, the author often prescribes an oral opiate drug for dogs
experiencing discomfort (e.g, tramadol). Various pain-relieving drug options are discussed in
detail in Chapter 18. In one report, the use of electroacupuncture as an adjunct to traditional
medical therapy in dogs with suspected disk thoracolumbar disk extrusions was more successful
in alleviating clinical signs than was traditional medical therapy alone.
Many dogs will respond favorably to medical management. In the author's clinical experi-
ence, 50%-70% of ambulatory patients with presumptive type I disk extrusions (cervical or
thoracolumbar) will have an initial positive response to medical therapy, though many of these
dogs tend to have recurrence of clinical signs. In the retrospective reports discussed in the
previous paragraph, sustained success was achieved wicth medical management in approximately
half of the patients (48.9% for cervical extrusions, 54.7% for thoracolumbar extrusions), whereas
initial success with subsequent disease relapse was experienced by about 30% of the dogs (33%
for cervical, 30.9% for thoracolumbar). Medical failure was considered a failure from the onset
of its institution in 18.1% and 14.4% of cervical and thoracolumbar cases, respecrively. The
mean follow-up time from onset of disease until collection of data was approximately 3 years in
these two retrospective investigations. In another retrospective study concerning medical treat-
ment of ambulatory dogs with suspected thoracolumbar disk extrusions (back pain with mild
neurologic deficits), all 78 dogs had an initial positive response to medical treatment, but 50% of
them (39 dogs) subsequently experienced recurrence of clinical signs (median follow-up time of
25 months). In this study, recurrence was more common in dogs receiving glucocorticoids than
those that received NSAIDs. However, fewer recurrences happened in dogs initially treated with
high-dose methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS; discussed later in this section) than dogs
treated with other glucocorticoid protocols, and there was no difference in the recurrence rates
between MPSS and NSAID dogs. Other reports of medically treated dogs with presumptive
mately 30%-40% as well.Enforced rest is thought to minimize further disk extrusion into the
vertebral canal and allow tears in the annulus fibrosus to heal (preventing further disk extrusion).
The inflammatory reaction caused by the extruded disk material is thought to subside during this
enforced resting period. If confinement therapy is successful, the patient should be gradually
allowed to return to a normal level of activity over a period of 4-6 weeks. The owners need to be
informed that the patient may acutely worsen during confnement and, especially with thoraco-
lumbar disk disease, may bccome a surgical emergency.
Type II disk disease that is not associated with cervical spondylomyclopathy or degenerative
lumbosacral stenosis is typically managed medically with restricted activity and anti-inflammatory
drugs. The injection of proteolytic enzymes (e.g, chymopapain) into type II disks to dissolve the
nucleus pulposus and cause fattening of the protruded annulus has been recently evaluated and
may hold some promise as a treatment for this disease. When surgical intervention is indicated
for a disk disease patient, spinal imaging and CSF analysis is typically performed on the anesthe-
tized patient immediately prior to surgery In this text, surgical intervention for disk disease
specifically refers to those procedures that allow for decompression of the spinal cord and
removal of disk material from the vertebral canal (e.g.,ventral slot,hemilaminectomy, dorsal
lamincctomy). There are miultiple variations of decompressive procedures in the literature, which
can be found in the reference section and will not 
be discussed in detail here. Disk fenestration is
rather than into the vertebral canal. The fenestration is performed in the ventral aspect of the
disk in the cervical region, and the lateral aspect of the disk in the thoracolumbar region. Disk
fenestration is considered to be a prophylactic measure. The efficacy of fencstration remains to be
dcfinitively proven. Therc are sevcral reports claiming decreased postopcrative discase recurrcnce
associated with fennestration procedures. However, these reports lack control groups for compati-
son (i.c., patients not fenestrated) and differ in types of fenestration procedures (both berween
and within studies), numbers of fenestrated disks within individual reports, and whar is consid-
ered a recurrencc (i.e., clinical signs that resolve with mcdical therapy vs. reoperation). In one
study, dogs with single disk fenestration (at the site of the hemilaminectormy) were compared
with those that also rcccived fenestration at adjacent disk spaces; thcre was no significant differ-
ence in operative recurrencc rate betwcen groups. Fenestration is generally a safe procedure, hut
canal during the procedure). There is also some concern that fenestration may predispose neigh
boring, nonfenestrated disks to rupture, leading to a recurrence of clinical disease. At the present
time, fenestration remains a potentially effective but unproven method of decreasing recurrence
of disease for type I extrusions and is a matter of clinician preference.
Surgical intervention is the preferred treatment modality for the following scenarios:
(1) Suspectcd type I cervical or thoracolumbar disk disease patients with minimal to no neuro-
ode  dsai nu si ei ud ro ued go sposda pdi iq syp oo
medical therapy.
(2) Suspected type I cervical disk disease patients with moderate to severe neurologic deficits
(retraparesis, tetraplegia). An acutely tetraplegic patient should be handled as a surgical
emergency,
(3) Suspected type I thoracolumbar disk disease patients that are nonambulatory. This includes
patients that are nonambulatory paraparetic (voluntary motor ability to hind limbs present,
but unable to walk umassisted) and those that are paraplegic (no voluntary motor ability to
pelvic limbs). These patients are considered to be surgical emergencies, as many will continue
to dereriorate to the point of losing pain perception to the pelvic limbs if surgical interven
tion is not pursued quickly. The success rate of medically managing nonambulatory dogs
with type I thoracolumbar disk extrusions is based on older litcrature, but it appears to center
around 50%. For dogs with absent dcep pain perception (DPP), a 5%-10% recovery ratc has
been suggested with medical management. Obviously, medical management is not ideal for
rhcse patients, but should still be considered (as an alternative to eurhanasia) if surgical
intervention is not an option (e.g., financial issues, precluding concurrent healh

monly performed in both the cervical and thoracolumbar regions, usually concurrently with a

severity from vomiting/diarrhea to fatal colonic perforation have been reported. In one study of
dogs with surgically confirmed thoracolumbar disk extrusions, the consequences of preoperative
dexamethasone administration (within 48 hours of hospital admission) were compared with
those associated with administration of other glucocorticoids (within the same time frame) and
no administration of glucocorticoids. There were no differences in neurologic outcomes between
groups. However, dexamethasone-treated dogs were 3.4 times more likely to have postoperative
complications than the other two groups.More specifically,dogs treated with dexamethasone
were 11.4 times more likely to develop a urinary tract infection and 3.5 times more likely to
develop diarrhea. The only glucocorticoid treatment that has been demonstrated to be of some
potential benefit in spinal trauma is the high-dose MPSS protocol. This protocol is discussed in

Chapters 6 and 12. The therapeutic efficacy of high-dose MPSS in human and veterinary spinal
[rauma has bcen questioned, however, and is generally thought to be an ineffective therapy. In
one retrospective report, high-dose MPSS therapy had no beneficial effect on outcome in surgi-
cally treated Dachshunds withi type 1 disk extrusions compared with Dachishunds that did not
receive this treaimcnt protocol; MPSS therapy was associated with a significantly increased level
of gastrointestinal complications in that study, in. addition to incrcased cost of hospitalization. In
a prospective stucly of nonambulatory dogs with type I disk extrusions that had surgery without
the usc of high-dlose MPSS, che surgical success rate was similar to previous reports that had
included high-dose MPSS as an adjunct to surgery. While evidence is steadily mounting against
the efficacy of high-dose MPSS in acute spinal cord injury, another novel treatment is being
scrurinized for cffcacy in spinal trauma. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic polymer that
has demonstrated efficacy in improving function in cxperimental spinal cord trauma models. In
one clinical study, intravcnous PEG was demonstrated to be cffctive in treating dogs with no
DPP following acute intervcrtchral disk cxtrusion. Since historical controls were used in this
investigation, it remains uncertain whether or not PEG is truly effective for spinal trauma. The
author has used intravenous PEG extensively in dogs, with no evidence of side effects. This
therapy is discussed in more detail in Chapter 12.
The prognosis for functional recovery

is expected in roughly 80%-95% of cases (reports range from 72% to 100%). In one study of

thoracolumbar disk extrusion is approximately 2 weeks (10-14 days). Return to ambulation

Most neurologists and surgeons would agree that surgical intervention should be pursued in
a timely manner once a dog with a thoracolumbar disk extrusion has become nonambulatory in
thc pclvic limbs. However, the literature regarding timeliness of surgical intervention and its
effect on time to return ro ambulation in such cases is conflicting. In one srudy of dogs with
type I thoracolumbar disk extrusion and intact DPP, an inverse relationship was found between
the time from nonambulatory status to surgical intcrvention and the time from surgical interven-
rion to regaining ambulatory function. Thcse results do not necessarily diminish the need for
expediency in operating on paticnts wirhout voluntary motor function. However, they may
suggest that parients with more rapid loss of motor function sustain more severe spinal cord
injury than those dogs with more progressive loss of moror function. The former animals likely
sustain more severe concussive (force of impact) spinal cord injury at the time of disk exrrusion,
voluntary motor function regained ambulatory ability significantly sooner postoperatively than
thosc without motor function (7.9 days vs. 16.4 days). Ninety-six percent of the dogs were
walking within 3 months. In another sirmilar study of paraplegic dogs with intact DPP, the rate
of development of paraplegia had a negative association with outcome, but not with the length
of recovery time in those dogs regaining ambulatory function. In this same study, the duration of
clinical signs prior to surgery (i.e, time from becoming paraplegic to surgical intervention) did
not significantly affect outcome, but was associated with longer recovery timcs; dogs paraplcgic

for longer time periods prior to surgery took longer to regain ambulatory status compared to
those with shorter time periods to surgical intervention. In nonambulatory dogs with thoraco-

to surgical intervention has not been associatcd with eventual outcome. In one report of thoraco-

I thoracolumbar disk disease and is associated with a guarded to poor prognosis. In this subset of
patients, the amount of time elapsed from the loss of DPP to surgical decompression has been
inversely associated with prognosis. Unfortunately, anl accurate estimate of when DPP was lost is
not always attainable in clinical practice. Most reports suggest a functional recovery rate in the
vicinity of 50% (between 25% and 78%) for paraplegic dogs that have lost DPP to the pelvic
limbs. Peracute (less than l hour) loss of voluntary motor function has been associated with a
hours) or gradual (more than 24 hours) loss of volunrary motor function in these dogs. Similar
to the situation in dogs with intact DPP, acute concussive spinal cord injury in dogs without
DPP seems to be more related to evenrual outcome than duration of spinal cord compression.
T here is a tendency for berter functional results when dogs with absent DPP are opcrated on
within 12 hours of losing DPP. The contention that thc absence of DPP for more than 48 hours
precludcs a chance for functional recovcry after surgery is probably inaccurate. The development
of focal or diffise myelomalacia (liquefaction. of the spinal cord parenchyma) is a conicern withi
dogs that havc lost pain pcrccption and can usually be ruled in or out only at surgery (via a
durotomy). Occasionally, myelomalacia will be evident on myelography (c.g., contrast medium
infiltrating spinal cord parcnchyma). Unfortunately, even with surgical confirmation of myeloma-
lacia in dogs with no DPP, there remains some level of subjectivity. Dogs with focal myelomala-
cia may stil recover funcrion, though the likelihood of this is unknown. In one study of
thoracolumbar disk extrusion patients with no DPP ro the pelvic limbs, the performance of a
durotomy had no effect on outcome. The author rourinely performs durotomies in dogs wich no
surgery that evcntually rccovcr ambulatory function tend to do so over longer tirne periods than
dogs that had DPP prior to surgery.

cases are likely to recover ambulatory function within 2-3 months.
In general, it appears from the available literature that recurrence of clinical signs of type I
disk extrusion is substantially higher for medically treated versus surgically treated cases.
Reported recurrence rates for surgically managed dogs with type 1 disk extrusions vary in the
literaturc, as do the definitions of recurrence. Recurrence of clinical signs of disk extrusion for
surgicaily trcatcd type I disk discasc patients is reported to be roughly between 10% and 25%,
but the vast majority of thesc recurrences do not require repeat surgical intervention (i.e.)
transient neck or back pain that responds to medlical management), In onc report, the reopera-
tive rate for clogs with thoracolumbar type I disk extrusions was found to be 6.4%. Most (83%)
recurrent disk extrusions occurred more than 1 month from the time of the initial surgery, and
thc majority of these (88%) were from a separate disk site. All recurrennt disk extrusions occur-
ring less than 1 month after the initial surgery were from thc initial disk extrusion site. Dogs
were found to he just as likely to achieve functional recovcry following repeat surgery as they
were afer the initial surgery. Dachshunds were thought to be at highest risk for reoperative disk
extrusions comparcd with other brceds (almost 10% in this study). In another stuly evaluaring
10/ MYELOPATHIES:DISORDERSOFTHESPINAL CORD

surgically managed dogs with type I thoracolumbar intervertebral disk extrusions, the recurrence
of clinical signs of disk extrusion was 19.2%. Among thicse cases were 24 reoperative recurrences
(10.5%) and 11 dogs euthanized because of recurrence (4.8%). Fifty percent of all dogs with
recurrence in this study were Dachshunds. Also in this study, risk of recurrence increased by 1.4
times for each opacified disk evident on thoracolumbar radiographs; dogs with five or six opaci-
fied disks evident at the first surgery had a 50% recurrence rate. In one study of small and large
dogs with surgically managed type I cervical disk extrusions, recurrence of cervical spinal hyper-
esthesia was documented in 10% of patients (8% in small dog group, 13% in the large dog
group). However, only 4% of dogs required a second surgery (2.1% in the small dog group,
8.7% in the large dog group). In one study of large-breed dogs with thoracolumbar disk extru-
sions, the reoperative recurrence rate was 12%.
Postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in dogs with thoracolumbar disk
often subclinical and may occur prior to surgery and up to several months following surgery.
These findings emphasize the need to routinely monitor such patients for UTI and to treat them
accordingly. Commonly incriminated organisms include Escherichia coli, Enterococci species, and
Stapbylococcus intermedius. In one study, several predictive factors were identified. Fernale dogs
were three times more likely to develop UTI than males, and dogs not administered periopera-
tive antibiotics were three times more likely to develop a UTl. Other factors that were signifi-
cantly associated with an increased chance of UTI included nonambulatory status (especially
with advancing age), inability to urinate voluntarily, and Icngth of time the body temperature
was below 35°C (95°F) while under anesthesia. In yet another study that evaluated postoperative
disk disease patients (cervical and thoracolumbar disks) with indwelling urinary catheters, 42%
had UTIs, and the odds of developing a UTI increased by 20% for each year of patient age and
27% for each day of catheterization. Antibiotic administration during the catheterization period
increased the odds of developing a UTI by 454%. The isolated organisms were similar to those
found in the other two studics. In all of these reports, the majority of UTls were not character-
ized by multiple drug-resistant organisms. The anatomic and nursing care principles associated
Patients with type II disk disease are often controlled adequately for long periods of time
guarded, as compared with type I disease, especially for lesions in the thoracolumbar spinal cord.
Substantial,sometimes permanent,neurologic deterioration after surgery ismore likely in these
patients. The reason(s) for this phenomenon is(are) unknown but may be due to such factors as
reperfusion injury and lack of spinal cord functional reserve capacity (due to chronic compres-
sion and atrophy). Despite the prevalence of type II disk discase in dogs, the literaturc regarding
surgical success for these patients is relatively sparse. What is available, however, suggests a much
lower success rate compared with type I disk extrusions. In the author's clinical experience, even
with minimal manipulation of the spinal cord at surgery, dogs with chronic type Il disk protru-
sions are often (at least 30%) permanently worse after surgery. A surgical procedure termed
disk protrusions. This procedure involves creating a lateral slot in two adjacent vcrtcbral bodies
and the intervening （protruding)disk,the dorsal limit of the slot being the Hoor of the vertebral
canal. With this procedure,the protruding disk material can be removed from the ventral aspect
of the spinal cord, minimizing spinal cord manipulation.

protrusion accompanied by a variable level of intervertebral instability. A congenital bony
stenosis of cervical vertebrae occurring in young (less than 2 years), primarily large- and giant-
breed dogs (e.g., Great Dane, Doberman Pinscher, Bassett Hound, Boerboel [South African dogs
similar to a Bullmastiff l) can also cause signs of cervical myelopathy.Although the terminology
is confusing,this disorderis sometimes called cervical stenotic myelopathy.This latter disease
processiscomparatively uncommon and often affectsmore cranial cervicalregions in addition to
caudal cervical sites.The following information refers mainly to the syndrome usually seen in
middle-aged to older dogs. This common syndrome principally affects adult Doberman Pin-
schers, but other large-breed dogs are affected as well. The C5-C6 and C6-C7 disk spaces are
most commonly involved. Caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy has also been reported in small-
breed dogs, most notably following ventral slot procedures. Instability in these dogs may have
been due to excessive ventral slot size,with subseqlent intervertebral instability.
b. Clinical signs are consistent with a caudal cervical myclopathy, with the pelvic limbs usually
more obviously affected than the thoracic limbs. If ambulatory, these patients typically exhibit a
stiff, choppy, shuffing thoracic limb gait and an ataxic, wide-based, pelvic limb gait. A thoracic
limb posture characterized by elbow abduction and internal rotation of the digits (toe-in") may
be appreciated in some dogs. Proprioceptive deficits are usually more appreciable in the pelvic
limbs than in the thoracic limbs, and it may be dificult to distinguish these patients as having a
mildly extended position may accentuate thoracic limb proprioceptive deficits. These dogs may
display neck pain, but it is often subtle. Low head carriage (fexed neck position) and resistance
to lateral movement and extension of the neck may be appreciated. The author has found that
direct dorsal digital pressure applied to the ventral aspect of the vertebrae see Chapter 3) usually
elicits discomfort in the caudal cervical region of dogs with CCSM. Onset of clinical signs is
typically slowly progressive over weeks to months,but it is occasionally acute and associated with
someminor traumaticevent.
C.
Diagnosis typically depends on spinal imaging, with MR imaging being preferable over myelog-
raphy or CT. Myelography typically is performed using several stress (fexion, extension, linear
traction) views (Fig. 10.12). These different views may be necessary (especially linear traction) to
adequately define the specific abnormalities and to guidc surgical decision making, if that route is
chosen. Both CT and MR imaging have been demonstrated to be useful imaging modalities for
CCSM. The author prefers MR imaging (Fig. 10.13), including linear traction views, for CCSM
cases. This is the preferred imaging modality for humans with the analogous condition, and the
veterinary literature supports the use of MR imaging over myelography in terms of both superior
diagnostic capability and less chance of adverse effects of the procedure (see Chapter 4). In
addition to providing a more detailed image of extradural compression, MR imaging provides
valuable information regarding spinal cord parenchymal changes (e.g., edema). Hyperintense
lesions of the spinal cord parenchyma on T2-weighted MR images (MRIs) were found in more
than half of CCSM Dobermans imaged in one study and seemed to be correlated with more
severe clinical presentations. One or more of the following types of spinal cord compression at
one or more disk spaces may be observed on spinal imaging for CCSM:
(1) Ventral compression, from a malaligned vertebral body, protruded dorsal annulus, and/or
hypertrophied dorsal longitudinal ligament.
(2) Dorsal compression, from hypertrophied ligamentum flavum.
(3) Lateral compression, from hypertrophied articular process (facet) joint capsules.
Linear traction views are probably the most informative and safest of the“stressed” views
used to document whethier a lesion is static or dynamic. Linear traction views (MRI and myelog
raphy) and fexion (ventrofexed) views (myelography) often relieve these compressive lesions,

factors (e.g., history, degree of hyperesthesia, etc.) in addition to evidence of post-traction.

In addition to the ambiguities associated with interpretation of traction views, one study
comparing clinically normal Doberman Pinschers to those with clinical signs of CCSM reported
these “normal" dogs had evidence of disk degeneration and 1l had evidence of foraminal steno-
sis. The clinically affected dogs had significantly smaller vertebral canals and wider disk spaces
than their clinically unaffected counterparts. These findings suggest that a relative vertebral canal
stenosis combined with potentially more disk material to protrude into the comparatively narrow
vertebral canal may represent predisposing factors for Doberman Pinschers with clinically
apparent CCSM. In one study, transcranial motor-cvoked potentials (MEPs) elicited from the
cranial tibial muscle in Doberrman Pinschers were found to be predictive of both MRI lesions
and clinical disease due to CCSM. This test may become a valuable screening tool for identifying
dogs with early clinical disease associated with CCSM.
d. Medical treatment can bc attempted in this disorder, consisting of cage confinement (34 weeks),
anti-inflammatory medication (e.g., predniscne), and, potentiall, the use of a neck brace. As
with other disk-associated problems, the patient should be gradually returned to normal activity
Over 46 weeks if the initial cage confinement therapy is successful. Surgical therapy is often
pursued, as CCSM is typically a progressive syndrome, and medical therapy has bccn tradition-
ally regarded as ineffective or effective only transiently. However, one retrospective report com-
pared medical therapy versus surgical therapy in 104 dogs with CCSM and found that medical
therapy was often effective for the disease.More specifically, it was found that the success rate for
the surgically treated group was 81% and that of the medically treated group was 53.5%; there
was no significant difference between these groups. In addition, 26.5% of the medically treated
group stayed the same (vs. 2% in the surgical group). There was no significant difference in
mean survival times between groups either (46.5 months for medically treated, 48.2 months for
viabletreatment optionfor CCSM,it should be noted that avariety of surgical procedureswere
represented in the surgical group, and 78% of them werc ventral slots. As discussed below, the
ventral slot procedure may not be as successful as procedures that involve distraction and stabili-
zation of the affectedvertebrae.
There have been numcrous surgical procedures advocated for this syndrome, and they fall
into two major categories:
(1) Ventral approach: The ventral approach usually involves a ventral slot procedure at the
affected space combined with distraction-stabilization, often with cancellous bone grafing at
that space. Commonly employed distraction-stabilization procedures include pin or screw
placement into vertebral bodies with a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bridge and PMMA
“plug” insertion into the distracted ventral slot. The author prefers a combination procedure
using both techniques (Fig. 10.14). Although performing a ventral slot alone has been
advocated by some as an adequate surgical procedure for CCSM, the literature suggests a
lower success rate with this approach, as well as a higher recurrence rate, in comparison with
distraction-stabilization procedures.
(2) Dorsal approach: The dorsal approach involves a dorsal laminectomy for decompression, with
or without articular facet screws or pins to help stabilize the joint space. The dorsal approach

maybepreferablewhen multiple disk spaces are affected or the compression is primarily
dorsalorlateral.
Lateral approaches to the cervical spinal cord have also been described, but they are techni-
cally demanding and not widely performed.Surgical stabilization of one disk spacemay lead to
abnormal biomechanical stresses on spaces cranial and caudal to those spaces. This is thought to
lead to secondary lesions at these latter spaces over time and is referred to as the domino effect.
The prognosis for dogs with caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy treated surgically is gener-
ally good,but it is somewhat unpredictable compared to type I disk extrusions.There are
numerous reports describing numerous surgical procedures for CCSM,with success rates varying
between 70% and 90%. Many dogs require a prolonged recuperative phase before regaining
treated via dorsal laminectomy, 71% worsened neurologically 2 days after surgery, and the mean
time to attain optimal neurologic function was 3.6 months. Nonambulatory dogs took an
average of 2.5 months to regain ambulatory ability. Nevertheless, 95% of the dogs undergoing
dorsal laminectomy had a good eventual outcome. In comparison, postoperative morbidity for
distraction-stabilization techniques has been reported as 12% or less. Although dogs undergoing
344
A PRACTICAL GUIDETO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
distraction-stabilization procedures tend not to worsen neurologically aftcr surgcry to the cxtent
exhibited by dogs undergoing dorsal laminectomy, prolonged recuperation is often required for
these patients as well. Dogs that prcsent nonambulatory and/or have more than one lesion on
myelography, tend to have a Icss favorable prognosis than armbulatory dogs and dogs having only
one demonstrable lesion. In general, dogs with caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy who are
ambulatory at prcscntation and have myelographic and/or CT/MR evidence of a single affected
intervertebral space have a favorable prognosis for functional rccovcry. The recurrence rate for
CCSM has been reported to be 22%-28%.
Inforination regarding the cervical stenotic myelopathy that affects younger dogs rcmains
limited. Dorsal decompression is often performed on such patients (due to multiple site involve-
ment as well as predominance of lateral and dorsal compression), especially if medical therapy
fails. In the author's cxpcrience, prognosis in such cases is often guarded to poor. However, there
is some preliminary cvidcnce that these cases rmay also be affected by a certain level of instability
that is relieved by traction. In a small number of reported cases, ventral distraction and fusion of
mttltiple disk spaces (via ventral slot and PMMA plugs) has been successful
 Degenerative myelopathy is a degenerative disease of unknown etiology primarily afecting the
Shepherd dog is by far the rnost comimon breed affected, but othcr dog breeds and onie cat have
been reported with this disease. Two young German Shepherd dogs (6-7 months old) have
recently been reported with a diseasc process consistent with degenerative myelopathy. In addi-
tion, a form of degenerative niyclopathy has been described in Pembroke Welsh Corgis. Patho-
logically, thcrc is loss of myelin and axons throughout the spinal cord, which is often
asymmetrical and mainly in the thoracic spinal cord rcgion. Associations between low serum
levels of certain vitamins (vitamins Bi and E) have been made in some Geriman Shepherd dogs
with degenerative myelopathy, but these associations have been questioned by subsequent studies.
There has also been some speculation that this disorder may have an autoimmune basis; however,
there is more recent evidence that an autoimmune etiology is unlikely. Another theory suggests a
predisposition for spinal cord damage due to oxidative or metabolic disturhances in the thoraco-
lumbar region due to a relative lack of vascular supply (in coinparison with othcr rcgions of the
various brain regions of dogs with degenerative myelopathy, suggesting secondary axonal degen-
cration as a possibility (c.g., Wallerian degeneration). A hereditary predisposition to degenerative
 myelopathy has been suggested but not proven,

affected Pembroke Welsh Corgis was 11.2 years in one study There appears to be a female
predominance (1.6: 1) for the disease in Corgis. Loss of pelvic limb proprioceptive ability (ataxia,
toe-dragging) is noticed initially, followed by gradual loss of voluntary motor function. Spinal
reflexes in the pelvic limbs are typically normal to hyperreflexive. Decreased to absent patellar
reflexes are found in approximately 10%--15% of patients, hovwever, and may refect selective
damage to dorsal lumbar nerve roots in these dogs. Pelvic limb tremors may be present during
weight suppor. Late in the disease process, urinary and/or fccal incontinence may develop. Dogs
often develop disuse atrophy of the pelvic limb musculature over time. The disease usually

C.A tentative diagnosis is based upon signalment, clinical features, and exclusion of other spinal
cord disorders. Patients with degcnerative myelopathy typically have normal CSF results, or
increased protein lcvels with a normal cell count. In one study, lumbar-derived CSF concentra-
tions of myelin basic protein (MBP) in German Shepherd dogs (measured via a commercially
available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for humans) with degenerative
myelopathy were significantly higher than concentrations in control dogs. Although elevated
MBP concentrations represent a nonspecific indication of a demyelinating disorder, this may be a
useful additional test for the diagnosis of degenerative myelopathy in dogs. Spinal imaging
(myelogram, MR, CT) is typically normal, but some dogs may have concurrent mild type II disk
dogs with degenerative myelopathy, a number of abnorimalities werc identified when compared
with normal dogs, including vertebral canal stcnosis, deformed spinal cord, small spinal cord,
focal attenuation of the subarachnoid space, and paraspinal muscle atrophy. A definitive diagno-
sis of degencrative myelopathy is based upon characteristic histopathologic lesions in the spinal
cord al necropsy.
d.Vitamin supplementation, glucocorticoid adninistration, and treatinent with the protease

Although exercise has becen traditionally recomumended in degenerative myelopathy cases, there
has been a lack of objective evidence to substantiate this recommendation. In one retrospective
stlidy of dogs with suspected degenerative myelopathy, however, intensive daily controlled
physiotherapy, including walking, passive range of motion of the pelvic limbs, massage of pelvic
limb and paraspinal rmuscles, and hydrotherapy, was shown to significantly improve mean
survival time (255 days) cornpared with dogs receiving moderate physiotherapy (130 days) or no
physiotherapy (55 days).

proposed as an encompasing term to include cysts that arise from ligamentous strucures (e.g.
yellow ligament) and the intervertebral disks that do not fit the histologic description of synovial
or ganglion cysts. All of these extradural cysts are believedi to have similar clinical presentations,
as well as identical treatment options and prognoses. Multiple cervical cysts tend to occur in
young. giant-breed dogs (e.g., Mastiff, Great Danc), whercas singlc thoracolumbar or lumbosa-
cral cysts are more likely to occur in older large-breed dogs (e.g., Gcrman Shephcrd dog, German
Shorthaired Pointer). These protrusions are typically dorsolateral, primarily causing an axial
deviation of the spinal cord or cauda equina. The etiology of this disorder is unknown but is
most likely associated with egenerative change in the articular facet joint, with subsequent
protrusion of collagenous periarticular joint tissue with or without synovium through a weakened
joint capsule. Transitional lurmbar vcrrebrae have been associated with these cysts in the lumbosa-
cral rcgion.

b. In addition to the breeds mentioned above, extradural synovial cysts have been reported in the
following breeds: Boxer dog, Border Collie, Irish Setter, Siberian Husky cross, and Boerbocl
(South African dog resembling a Mastiff). An extradural cyst arising from the annulus fibrosus
was also described in a Rottweiler. Clinical signs of myelopathy correlare to the location of the
cystic lesions. The progression of clinical signs has been reported to vary from several days to a
year, with most cases progressing over several months.
C.Tentative diagnosis depends upon imaging findings, with MR inaging (Fig. 10.15) being
on plain radiography, and myelography typically reveals axial deviation of the spinal cord by the
cystic strucrures, best visualizcd on ventrodorsal views. Myelography will verify an extradural
mass, but will not identify the mass as cystic, mraking it difficult to discern from other extradural
compressive diseases. A consistent CSF finding for this disorder is elevated protein levels with
normal cell count, but a rnild pleocytosis may occur. Definitive diagnosis requircs histopathologic
examination of the cysts.
d. Surgical trearment of this disorder involves laminectomy (dorsal laminectomy or hemilaminec-
tomy) and removal of rhe compressive synovial cyst(s). The prognosis for recovery with surgical
management appears to be cxcellent.
a.Hypertrophy of the vertebral articular processes (facets) in both the cervical and thoracohumbar
region has been identified in dogs as a degenerative process that can lead to pain and/or signs of
myelopathy as an independent entity. Although facet joint hyperrophy is often documented
both as a component and a potential consequence of other degenerative spinal disorders (e.g-.
type II disk protrusion, caudal cervical spondylonyelopathy), it has been documented to cause
malarticulation betwcen the cranial and caudal articular proccsscs leads to joint instability and
progressive hypertrophy. Theories proposed to account for such a malarticulation include trauma,
prior (i.e., resolved) infection, and congenital malformation. The most likely explanation for this
phenomenon is congenital malformation. Specifically, caudal vertebral articular process dysplasia
Or aplasia has been docunented in dogs that have developed articular process (facct) hypertrophy
in the thoracolurnbar region. The chronic instability caused by congenitally abnormal arricular
processes is thought to lead to progressive hypertrophy of the facet region (in addition to adja-
ccnt soft tissue structures such as the yellow ligament and synovium) over tine.
b. Breed-associated vetebral articular process (facct) hypertrophy has been described in Shiloh
Shepherd dogs (five dogs) and Scottish Decrhounds (ninc dogs). Ihe Shiloh Shepherd dogs were
young, ranging in age from 3.5 months to 16 months, and had one or more compressive articu-
sented with clinical signs of a progressive T3-L3 myelopathy (paraparesis, pelvic linb ataxia).
The dogs were closely related, and three of them were litterimates. The Scotish Deerhounds were
neurologic deficits. Unilateral or bilateral articular proccss hypertrophy at the C2-C3 spacc was
documenred in all dogs. In addition to these cases, similar articular process (facet) hypertrophy
in the thoracolumbar rcgion has bccn described in a 6-year-old Great Dane, two German
Shepherd dogs (10 months and 2 years of age), a 4-year-old rmixcd-breed dog, and a 10-month-
old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). In one of the German Shepherd dogs, the abnormal
facet joint was an incidental finding. In the remainder of the cases, a progressive T'3-L3 myelop-
athy was described.
C. Tentative diagnosis of this condition is based on spinal imaging. Although these lesions are
typically evident on radiographs and myelography, CT (Fig. 10.16) and MR imaging provide
Inore detail regarding the extent of spinal cord compression. In the Scotrsh Dcerhound disorder,
no evidence of spinal cord compression was evident on myelography, suggesting that the pain

was emanating from the abnormal facet joints. Definitive diagnosis is via histopathologic cvalua-
tion of the abnormal articular process (facet) tissue, documenting degenerative joint disease.
d.In the Scottish Deerhound disorder, intra-articular injection (of affected joints) of corticosteroid
(10 mg triamcinolone acetonide per joint) and lidocaine (20 mg per joint) was effective in
relieving neck pain in cight of nine dogs. Seven dogs remained free of clinical signs for more
than four months with this treatment. For the other dogs with evidence of spinal cord compres-
sion,surgical decompression andremoval of the abnormal facet tissue appears tobe the most

for this disease process appears to be high.
a.
Rottweiler leukoencephalomyelopathy is a progressive, non-painful demyelinating disease of
unknown etiology reported in young adult (1.5-4 years of age) Rottweilers and a Rottweiler
cross-bred dog. This disease is classified as a leukodystrophy, a CNS white matter disorder charac-
terized by abnormal myelin synthesis and/or maintenance. The mode of inheritance is suspected
tobeautosomalrecessive.

b. Clinical signs are suggestive of a slowly progressve cervical myelopathy. Hypermerria is often
more pronounced in the thoracic limbs, while conscious proprioceptive deficits are often more
obvious in the pelvic limbs. The tetraparesis slowly worscns over 6--12 months.
C.A tcntative diagnosis is based upon signalment, history, clinical signs, and ruling out other causes
of ccrvical myelopathy with appropriate diagnostic tcsts. Results of CSF analysis, radiography/

not exhibit classical featurcs of cerebellar dysftinction. In another disease of Rottweilers, neuroax-
onal dystrophy, clinical signs of cerebellar dlysfunction are common; feuroaxonal dystrophy is
discussed in Chapter 9.
d.There is no effective treatrnent available for this discase, and thc prognosis for recovery is poor.
7. Afghan Hound hcreditary myelopathy.6s>9220.256,31,17
a. A rapidly progrcssve leukodystrophy has becn described in young (3- to 13-month-old) Afghan
Hounds with an autosomal recessivc mode of inheritance.
b. Clinical signs are initially consistent with either a C6-T2 or a T3-L3 myelopathy, These patients
typically present with a symmetrical paraparesis, and may display a “bunny-hopping” gait.
Within 1-3 weeks, these dogs become paraplegic, and some may become tetraparetic or tetraple-
gic. Respiratory dysfunction can subsequently occur and lead to death if euthanasia is not
performed prior to this development.
C. Other than elevated CSF protein levels in sone dogs with this disease, results of diagnostic tests
are normal. A tentative diagnosis is based upon signalmcnt and clinicai fndings. listopathologi-
cally, there is bilaterally symmetrical vacuolation of spinal cord white mater with extensive
myelin loss from caudal cervical to lower lumbar segments. There may be lesions in the brain
stem area, but there is no clinical evidence of brain stem disease.
d. There is no treatment for this disease, and the prognosis is poor. A similar disorder has been
reported in Dutch Kooiker dogs.
8. Other leukodystrophies39,417
a. Leukodystrophies resulting in clinical signs of spinal cord dysfunction lhave been reported in
young Dalmatians and Miniature Poodles. A rare disorder calld fbrinoid leukoclystrophy has
bcen sporadicaly reported in a niumber of young dogs. Dogs with this latter discase typically
show signs of brain and spinal cord clysfunction. Histologically, astrocytic inclusion bodics, called
Rosenthal fbcrs, arc scen in dogs with fibrinoid leukodystrophy.
dliseases previously classificd as leukodystrophy/sponigy degeneratio have subsequently been
proven to be mitochondrial disorders or organic acidurias, some of which may respond to
thcrapy. These disorders are discussed in morc detail in Chaptcr 5.
9.Heredirary ataxia of Jack Russell and Snooth Fox Terriers29.167.391,432
a.Hereditary ataxia of Jack Russell and Smooth Fox Terriers is a rare, presumably inherited disorder
in which spinal cord axons and myelin in the cervical and thoracolumbar areas undergo progres-
sive degeneration. This is thought to be predominantly an axonopathy and has been reported in
Parson Jack Russell Terriers, Jack Russell Terriers, and Fox Terriers. A similar pathologic condi
tion has been described in Ibizan Hounds. Lesions in central auditory pathways have also been
described, most notably in the lateral lemniscus and trapezoid body.
b. Clinical signs begin with pelvic limb ataxia at 2--9 months of age, and eventually al four limbs
ale affected. The dysmetric gait and occasional intention tremor are more suggestive of cerebellar
dysfunction than a myelopathy. It is suspected that the lesion responsible for the characteristic
spastic gait is in the spinocerebellar tracts of the ccrvical spinal cord. Therc is no clinical cvidencc
of hcaring impairment. Clinical signs often worsen with acuivity and excirerment, and muscle
fasciculations may be observed. In one study of 35 affected Jack Russell Terriers, other clinical
350
APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
abnormalities included generalized seizures (13 dogs), respiratory distress (7 dogs, after minimal
exercise), exercise intolerance (11 dogs), and behavior changes (7 dogs, aggression or anxiety).
Focal or generalized seizures were also described in Ibizan Hounds with a similar disorder.
C. A tentative diagnosis is based upon characteristic signalment and clinical features, in addition to
normal imaging and CSF results. Abnormal brain stem auditory evoked response test results have
been described in some Jack Russell Terriers with this disorder. Definitive diagnosis is based upon
characteristic histopathologic features of the brain and spinal cord after death.
d.There is no treatment for this disorder, and the prognosis is guarded to poor. The disease is
slowly progressive and may stabilize. Affected animals may have a good quality of life, despite the
gait abnormalities. In the study of 35 Jack Russell Terriers, clinical signs worsened in 34 dogs,
necessitating euthanasia at an average of 16 months following presentation.
a.Labrador Retriever axonopathy is a recently described degenerative disease of young (3- to 4
week-old) Labrador Retrievers, presumably of autosomal recessive inheritance. Progressive axonal
degeneration occurs throughout the spinal cord, as wcll as in the brain stem and ccrcbellum.
Abnormal development of the corpus callosum is a consistent feature.
b. Clinical signs begin with pelvic limb ataxia and paresis that rapidly progresses to a dysmetric
tetraparesis. Some dogs display intention tremors. Most dogs cannot rise without assistance by 3-
5 months of age. Signs are suggestive of cerebellar and spinal cord disease.
ment, and the prognosis is poor.
11. Iysosomal storage diseases
a.Iysosomal storage disorders typically cause signs of a progressive multifocal encephalopathy and/
or myelopathy in a young (2- to 6-month-old) animal. Occasionally, clinical signs of a progres-
sive myelopathy predominate. Examples are globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease) in
dogs and mucopolysaccharidosis in cats. Lysosomal storage diseases are discussed in Chapter 5.
b.Prognosis is usually poor. Sometimes, decompressive surgery in cases of mucopolysaccharidosis
(with malformed vertebrac impinging on the spinal cord) will be successful.
12. Motor neuron diseases
While the motor neuron group of diseases technically falls under spinal cord disorders, they
result in lower motor neuron signs and will be discussed in Chapter 14.
B.Anomalous/developmental
a.Many vertebral malformations are discovered incidentally and do not cause clinical problems. Some
malformations may lead to spinal cord damage and clinical signs of dysfunction by static or progres-
sive (i.e., as the patient grows into adulthood) spinal stenosis and/or vertebral instability causedby
the abnormal vertebra or vertebrae. The commonly reported vertebral malformations are:
(1) Hemivertebra (Fig. 10.17): A hemivertebra occurs when part of the vertebra fails to form
properly, usually the vertebral body. The abnormal vertebra usually has a wedge shape. If the
central part of the vertebra fails to form, a type of hemivertebra called butterffy vertebra may
French Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, Pug dogs, etc.), but they have also been described in a
number of other toy and miniarure-breed dogs. The mid-thoracic region of the vertebral is
most often affected, with the T8 vertebra being commonly involved. The malformed verte-
brae lead to varying degrees of abnormal angulation of the spine, including kyphosis, lordo-
sis, and scoliosis. In addition to the compression of the spinal cord at the level of the
malformation, instability is thought to play a rolc in the development of myelopathy in
clinically affected dogs.
(2) Block vertebra (Fig. 10.18): A block vertebra is a failure of segmentation leading to a com-
bined vertebra composed of what should have been two or more single vertebrae.

Fig. 10.19.Ventrodorsal radiograph of a dog with spina bifida of a thoracic vertebra.
(3) Spina bifida (Fig. 10.19): Spina bifida is a failure of fusion of the dorsal parts of the vertebra.
This may occur alone and cause no clinical signs of dysfunction,but it is often associated
with meningeal and/or spinal cord malformations (e.g., meningocele, myelomeningocele).
English Bulldogs and Manx cats appear to be predisposed to this disorder.
(4) Stenotic vertebral canal: A stenotic vertebral canal occurs in association with other anomalies
(e.g., hemivertebra) or as an isolated vertebral malformation. Relative stenosis refers to canal
narrowing that does not cause compression of neural tissue, whereas absolute stenosis means
that the stenosis does compress parenchymal tissue. Doberman Pinschers often have a relative
stenosis of the cranial thoracic vertebrae (usually T3-T6).Absolute stenosis of cervica
vertebrae has been described in Bassett Hounds, Doberman Pinschers, and Great Danes.
(5)Transitional vertebra (Fig.10.20):Transitional vertebra have shapes charactcristic of two
different vertebral types. The most common examples are lumbarization of the sacrum or
sacralization of the last lumbar vertebra. The clinical significance of these vertebrae will be
discussed in Chapter 11.
(6) Atlantoaxial (AA) instability (Fig. 10.21): Atlantoaxial instability is usually caused by hypo-
plasia or aplasia of the dens. Abnormal ligamentous support of the dens may also be
involved. This problem is usually seen in miniature and toy dog breeds, often less than 2

dorsal subluxation or luxation of the axis, with resultant compression of the cranial cervical
spinal cord. Associated malformations of the atlas and/or ocipital bones may be observed in
somepaticnts.

anatomiclocation of the abnormality.In most cases,the clinically affected patient is animmature

of dysfunction may be acute or chronic. Depending on the specific abnormality or abnormalities,
deficits to tetraplegia with respiratory difficulty.Dogs with clinical dysfunction due tohemiverte
brae typically present with evidence of a T3-L3 myelopathy of varying severity and rate of
progression. Most of these dogs are less than a year old at presentation, but older dogs have been
reported.
C.
Diagnosis of a vertebral malformation as a cause of clinical disease is based upon signalment,
history, and neurologic deficits that match the location of the abnormality. Plain radiography and
myelography have traditionally been used in diagnosis, but CT and MR imaging are being used
more commonly. Stressed views may be used to demonstrate atlantoaxial instability, but they
must beperformedwithcaution.Overzealous flexion of theneckto demonstrateinstability of
the C1-C2 joint space may have disastrous results in these patients. A potentially safer method
of diagnosing AA instability in dogs is via CT or MR imaging (Fig. 10.22).
d.Treatment of patients with vertebral malformations that cause clinical signs of dysfunction is
often frustrating, but some cases may respond to medical therapy (e.g., anti-inflammatory doses
of glucocorticoids,neckbrace forAAinstability) orsurgical stabilizationwith orwithout decom
pression.Atlantoaxial instability is sometimes treated nonsurgically, often involving external
splinting of the neck, with or without administration of anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., predni-
sone). One retrospective study of AA dogs treated nonsurgically (all received external splinting)
cited a good final outcome in 10 of 16 dogs (62.5%). Six of the dogs in this report (37.5%) died
or were euthanized due to neurologic deterioration or lack of improvement following splint
removal. In this study, the only factor significantly associated with outcome was length of clinical
signs prior to therapy; dogs affected fewer than 30 days were more likely to have positive out-
comes than dogs affected more than 30 days. Surgical success rates for AA instability vary in the
literature from approximately 60% to 90%; however, most recent reports regarding surgical
treatment of this disorder describe a surgical success rate exceding 80%. Similar to what has
been reported for nonsurgical management of AA instability patients, length of clinical disease
presence has been negatively associated with surgical success as well. Several studies also suggest
that the severity of neurologic dysfunction prior to surgery is also inversely related to outcome;
the prognosis for patients with AA instability is fair to good if there are mild to moderate
recommended by the author involves a ventral approach with cancellous bone grafting and
stabilization with pins, screws, and PMMA (Fig. 10.23). A dorsal approach that involves securing
the atlas to the axis with orthopedic wire or suture is also commonly performed.Postoperative
complications involving upper respiratory function (e.g., coughing, gagging, laryngeal paralysis)

occasionally occur with the ventral approach.Aspiration pneumonia is also a potential postopera-
tive complication that may be related to upper airway (i.e., laryngeal) and/or pharyngeal dysfunc-
tion. Anecdotally, the author has found that relaxing the self-retaining retractors at frequent
intervals (e.g., every 10 minutes) during surgery dramatically reduces the rate of postoperative
upper airway complications. Overall, reported perioperative mortality rates for surgical manage-
ment of dogs with AA instability vary from 0% to 30%,with most recent reports having rates of
about 5%-10%. Because of the proximity of the AA site to the brain stem centers for cardiac
and respiratory control, intraoperative deaths have been attributed to inadvertent damage to
thesemedullary regions.
There are limited reports regarding the surgical management of dogs with hemivertebrae
experiencing clinical signs of myelopathy.However, stabilization of the abnormal vertebral
segment, with or without decompression, has been successful in most of the cases reported
(Fig.10.24).

2. Stenotic vertebral canal220
In contrast to the congenital condition, this is progressive until skeletal growth is completed.
This may be due to inborn errors of skeletal growth or other as yet unidentified factors. The stenosis
can berelative or absolute,similar to the congenital condition.
a.Alsoknown as osteochondroma/osteochondromatosis,cartilaginous exostosesis an uncommon
condition in which nodules of cartilage,with or without bone, proliferate in the growth plate
areas of various bones.The vertebrae, ribs, and long bones of the limbs are most frequently
affected.Multiple lesions(multiple cartilaginous exostoses or MCE) are seen most commonly,
but solitary growths occasionally occur. This disease typically occurs in young dogs and adult
cats. There is some evidence that this is a heritable condition in dogs. In cats, MCE has been
associatedwith thefelineleukemiavirus (FeLV).
b.Clinical signs of myelopathy occur when exostoses of the vertebrae impinge on the spinal cord.
Most dogs with MCE affecting the spinal cord are presented for clinical signs of myelopathy
before 1 year of age. However, dogs with MCE may be young adults (more than 1 year old) by
the time the mass or masses result in clinical signs of disease. Some dogs may develop neurologic
dysfunction at an older age due to neoplastic transformation of one or more exostoses. Cats with
MCE tend to be adults at the time clinical signs of myelopathy are evident.The clinical signs
depend upon the region(s) of the spinal cord that is(are) compressed.
C. A tentative diagnosis is made by visualizing the characteristic lesions on spinal imaging; the
masses are usually evident on plain radiography and myelography (Fig. 10.25), but CT (Fig.
10.26) and MR imaging provide more detailed information in regard to the extent of vertebral
involvement and spinal cord compression. Definitive diagnosis is attained through histopatho-
logic examination of the nodules.
d. Prognosis with surgical resection of compressive vertebral masses in a skeletally mature dog has
traditionally been regarded as generally good because growth of exostoses was thought tobe
arrested at the time of skeletal maturity. However, there is some evidence in dogs suggesting that
progressive growth of exostoses after skeletal maturity may be more common than previously
believed, warranting a guarded to poor prognosis in some cases. The disease is considered
aggressive in cats and has a poor prognosis.Malignant transformation of exostoses in adult
animals has been described. Such transformation may also be more common in dogs than
previously appreciated, sometimes occurring several years after diagnosis of cartilaginous
exostoses.
4.Meningoceles/myelomeningoceles
Meningoceles and myelomeningoceles are protrusions of meninges and CSF, with or without
parenchymal tissue, respectively. They are often associated with spina bifida. They occur most
commonly in the lumbosacral region. They will be discussed in Chapter 11.

5. Spinal dysra2p2hism 69,14,1,150,2027,33.393.106
a.Myelodysplasia is a catchall term that refers to a number of abnormalities of embryological
development, including duplication and absence of cord structures, as well as syringomyelia and
hydromyelia.A specificform ofmyelodysplasia,referred to as spinal dysraphism,is thought to bc
a hereditary disease in Weimaraner dogs. This condition occasionally occurs in other dog breeds.
Most of the abnormalities are located along the median plane of the spinal cord in these dogs.
b.Clinical signs of a T3-L3 myelopathy are usually apparent by 4-6 weeks of age. A bunny-
hopping pelvic limb gait is the most characteristic feature of spinal dysraphism. Proprioceptive
deficits in the pelvic limbs are also common, whereas paraparesis is uncommon.The condition is
 also typically non-progressive, even when hydromyelia/syringomyelia is present.
C.A tentative diagnosis of spinal dysraphism is made primarily based upon signalment, history, and
clinical signs. Results of diagnostic tests (e.g., CSF analysis, radiography, myelography, CT, MR
imaging) are typically normal, depending upon the specifc spinal abnormalities and the specific
tests performed (e.g., hydromyelia/syringomyelia may not be apparent on myelography, but will
likely be visible with MR imaging).
d. There is no treatment for spinal dysraphism. Since the clinical signs are usually not severe, and
the disorder is not progressive, the prognosis for life as a functional pet is good.

a.Technically, hydromyelia is a fuid dilatation of the central canal, and syringomyelia is a fuid
dilatation within the spinal cord outside the central canal that may or may not communicate
with the central canal. Distinguishing between hydromyelia and syringomyelia is often impos-
sible in the living patient and is clinically unimportant. For purposes of consistency, the term
syringomyelia is used to refer to this disorder in this textbook.The vast majority of syringomyelia
cases in dogs appear to be secondary to caudal occipital malformation syndrome (COMS), the
canine analog of human Chiari type I malformation. Although COMS with syringomyelia has
been reported in a number of dog breeds, the most commonly affected breed is the Cavalier
King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). Caudal occipital malformation syndrome and syringomyelia are
discussed in detail in Chapter 5, so syringomyelia will be only briefy discussed here. Syringomy-
elia may be associated with other congenital spinal cord (e.g., spinal dysraphism) and/or brain
(e.g., Dandy-Walker syndrome, hydrocephalus, quadrigeminal cyst) malformations, but may also
be caused by inflammatory and ncoplasticprocesses that obstruct thefow of CSF.It can also

occur secondary to spinal cord trauma.This condition can also occur as a solitary disorder of an
unknown etiology (i.e., idiopathic).
In human beings, the majority of syringomyelia cases are associated with abnormalities of the
caudal medullary/cerebellar region of the brain, such as Chiari type I malformation (most
commonly), intra-arachnoid cysts, and Dandy-Walker syndrome. It is believed that these hind-
brain anomalies are not merely coincidental malformations that occur concomitantly with
syringomyelia,but that they may actually cause the syringomyelia by disrupting normal CSF
fowmechanisms.In addition, abnormalities of the cranial cervical spine have been described to
occur concomitantly with Chiari type I malformation in people. The author has encountered a
number of young dogs with syringomyelia that have cranial cervical compressive lesions (typically
dorsal compression at C1-C2) that may or may not occur concurrently with COMS
(Fig. 10.27).
b. Clinical signs of a myelopathy (typically cervical) may be acute or chronic and may or may not
be progressive. In many of the reported cases associated with COMS, onset of clinical signs of
neurologic dysfunction occurred in adulthood. However, dogs with COMS-related syringomyelia
are being increasingly diagnosed at younger ages (less than I year); whether this refects an
increased awareness of the disorder, an increase in the severity of disease, or a combination is
unknown. The age range of clinical disease onset is very broad, possibly reflecting the multitude
of suspected etiologies for the condition. This age range may also refect different rates of Auid
accumulation and subsequent spinal cord dysfunction among dogs.Scoliosis, especially of the
cervical region (i.e., torticollis) and spinal hyperesthesia are frequent clinical findings in cases of
syringomyelia. In syringomyelia cases due to COMS, syrinx width was correlated with both pain
and scoliosis in one study. The development of scoliosis has been proposed to be due to asym-
metric damage caused by accumulated fuid to lower motor neurons that supply epaxial/hypaxial
musculature.An alternative and more likely hypothesis is that the scoliosis is a sensory phenom-
enon due to asymmetric damage to dorsal horn gray matter by the acumulated fuid (A. de
Lahunta, personal communication). Proprioceptive deficits and limb paresis also occur with some
frequency.
Persistent scratching at the neck and shoulder area is a characteristic feature of syringomyelia,
especially in the CKCS breed.
 Diagnosis may be diffcult or impossible to achieve with myelography. Occasionally during

 or normal on myelography. Computed tomography or MR imaging (ideally) is much more likely
to demonstrate the cavitary lesions. The author prefers MR imaging for dogs suspected to have
hydromyelia/syringomyelia, as this imaging modality is more likely to identify Chiari-like
malformations (sagittal view) as well as the fuid-filled spinal cord lesions (Fig. 10.28).
Cerebrospinal fuid is often either normal or indicative of mild inflammation in most cases of
syringomyelia; CSF should be evaluated to help rule out potential underlying causes (e.g.
inflammatory/infectious disease) or concurrent disorders.
d.Medical and surgical trcatment options for syringomyelia are discussed in detail in Chapter 5. In
general, most dogs with clinical disease due to syringomyelia will respond favorably to medical
therapy, but this response may be short-lived. Surgical options are based on removing or dimin-
ishing the cause of the syrinx (e.g., foramen magnum decompression for COMS).

to be the basis for this disorder. A sinus tract with a small cutaneous opening on the dorsal midline
extends ventrally to various depths, sometimes to the level of the subarachnoid space. This is
encountered most commonly in Rhodesian Ridgeback dogs, but has been reported in other breeds.
Other breeds reported with dermoid sinus include Ridgeback crossbreed, Thai Ridgeback dog,
Cocker Spanicl (American and English), Shih Tzu, Siberian Husky, Golden Retriever, Boxer dog,
Chow Chow,GreatPyrences,Bocrbocl,FoxTerrier,Rottweiler,Brittany Spanicl,SpringerSpanicl,
English Bull Terrier,and YorkshireTerrier.The sinus is most often located in the cervical,cranial
360
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
thoracic, and sacrocaudal regions, but it can occur anywhere along the spine. Dermoid sinuses
have also been reported in the head region. The sinus tract is lined with squamous epithelium and
adnexa (hair follicles and sebaceous glands).Dermoid sinus is thought to be a heritable condition,
especially in the Rhodesian Ridgeback dog, in which the percentage of affecred dogs is reported to
be 5.3%. The exact mode of inheritance is undetermined at this point. The ridge trait appears to
be inherited in an autosomal dominant mode, and the presence of the ridge predisposes dogs to
develop dermoid sinus. Dermoid sinuses have been classified as types I-V, depending on the extent
of penetration of tissue bencath the subcutaneous layer.
b. Clinical signs may vary from irritation due to bacterial infection of the sinus (most commonly),
to evidence of meningitis and myelitis in cases that involve sinus communication with the
meninges and spinal cord. Onset of clinical signs usually occurs at a young age, but can occur at
any age. A thick fibrous cord (the sinus) can often be palpated subcutaneously on rhe dorsal
midline.
C. Diagnosis is based upon signalment, history, clinical signs, and demonstration of a sinus tract via
fistulography. Myelography or other imaging modalities (CT or MR) may also be used to
demonstrate or rule out communication of the sinus with the subarachnoid space. Contrast sinus
fistulograms should be performed with agents that are safe to use for myelography, if communi-
cation of the sinus with the subarachnoid space is suspected or known.
d. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics based upon culture and sensitivity rcsults and
complete surgical excision of the sinus tract. Prognosis varies with the extent of ncurologic
dysfunction (if any) and whether or not the entire sinus tract is successfully removed. In general
the prognosis is guarded to good.
a.The name spinal arachnoid cysts is a misnomer because the lesions are actually CSF-filled diver-
ticula of the subarachnoid space, rather than true cysts. These lesions have also been described as
meningeal cysts,leptomeningeal cysts,spinal arachnoid pseudocysts, arachnoid cavitations,and
arachnoid diverticula.Proposed causes of these anomalous fuid accumulations are numerous,
including congenital malformation, trauma, infammation (arachnoiditis), and neoplasia.
However, an underlying etiology is rarely found for spinal arachnoid cysts. The accumulated
fuid causes compression of adjacent spinal cord parenchyma, resulting in clinical signs of
myelopathy. Spinal arachnoid cysts are typically solitary, dorsally or dorsolaterally located focal
accumulations of fuid that occur at either the cranial cervical (most commonly over C2-C3
vertebral segments) or caudal thoracic regions of the spinal cord. Multiple or bilobed spinal
arachnoid cysts are frequently encountered, however, especially in the cervical region of Rottwei-
lers. Ventrally located spinal arachnoid cysts have also been reported.
b.Spinal arachnoid cysts have been described in a considerable number of dogs and several cats.
Rottweilers appear to be particularly predisposed to spinal arachnoid cysts. In this breed, dorsally
located fuid accumulations in the cranial cervical regions are common. Multiple other dog
breeds, including a number of small-breed dogs, have also been reported with this condition.
The age at onset of clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction is quite variable, ranging from several
months to 12 years of age. Most reported dogs developed signs of myelopathy in young adult-
hood. Slowly progressive ataxia and paresis (paraparesis or tetraparesis, depending on lesion
location) are typical clinical features of this disorder. Dogs with dorsally or dorsolarerally located
cranial cervical lesions (oftcn Rottweilers) typically exhibit tctraparesis with hypermetria, primar-
ily in the thoracic limbs (presumably via interference of the“cyst” with spinocerebellar tracts).
Spinal hyperpathia does not appear to be a prominent clinical feature of this disorder,but it has
beendescribed.
C.The diagnosis of spinal arachinoid cysts is based primarily on spinal imaging; myelographic
diagnosis of spinal arachnoid cysts is most commonly reported. Both CT and MR imaging (Fig.
10.29) have also been successfully used to identify spinal arachnoid cysts, and provide more

detailed information regarding cyst lateralization and potential associated abnormalities (e.g)
syringomyelia). The typical myelographic appearance is a bulbous, contrast-filled diverticulum
continuouswith the contrast column of the subarachnoid space,with acharacteristic teardrop
shape (Fig.10.30). CSF analysis is often within normal limits, but may have a mild mononuclear
meningeal tissue (dura-arachnoid).
d.Medical management (i.e., glucocorticoid therapy) may be attempted, but it is unlikely to be
successful in the long term. Surgical management involves resecting a portion of the meninges
comprising the“cyst”wall, thereby relieving the pressure excrted on the underlying spinal cord
parenchyma. From the limited data available, surgical treatment of spinal arachnoid cysts in dogs
and cats appears to have a good prognosis. There is some evidence that marsupialization of the

1. There are a large number of tumors that can affect the spinal cord of dogs and cats. As with brain
tumors (see Chapter 5), tumors affecting the spinal cord can be conceptually divided into primary
and secondary tumors.Primary tumorsinclude thoseneoplasmsthat arisefrom spinal cordparen
chyma (e.g, neurons, glial cells), or associated meningeal/ependymal tissue. Secondary tumors
include primary or metastatic vertebral neoplasms, malignant nerve sheath tumors (MNST; see
Chapter 14 also), and metastases to the extradural space or the cord parenchyma (intramedullary
metastases). As with brain tumors, primary tumors are more common than metastatic tumors. It is
often clinically useful to classify spinal cord neoplasms based upon the relationship between the
tumor and themeninges.Spinal cord tumors are typically classified as extradural, intradural/extra-
medullary, or intramedullary (see Chapter 4). Since some spinal tumors occupy more than one of

category of mixed compartment has been suggested. In one large retrospective study of 399 histo-
pathologically confirmed spinal cord tumors in dogs, 48% were extradural, 13% were intradural/
extramedullary, 6% were intramedullary, and 33% were mixed compartment. Spinal cord tumors
cxert their pathologic effects by compression and/or invasion of the spinal cord, as well as producing
peritumoral edema, infammation, and hemorrhage. Examples of some of the more commonly
encounteredspinalcordtumorsindogsandcatsareasfollows:
a.Extradural tumors: This category includes primary and secondary (metastatic or local invasion)
vertebral and soft tissue tumors.Primary vertebral tumors such as osteosarcoma, chondrosar-
coma, mycloma (plasma cell tumor), fbrosarcoma, and hemangiosarcoma are common extradu-
ral tumors encounteredin dogs.In one study,vertebral tumorswereslightly lessprevalent than

reported in cats include fbrosarcoma,undifferentiated sarcoma,and plasma cell tumors.The
most common primary vertebral body tumor in dogs is also osteosarcoma. Carcinomas account

for the majority of secondary vertebral tumors in dogs. It may be diffcult in some cases to
ascertain whether a vertebral tumor is primary or metastatic. Other tumors may occur in the
epidural space, without directly involving the vertebrae. Common among these are sarcomas,
most frequently osteosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma. Lymphosarcoma can be primary or meta-
static and is often located in the extradural space,particularly in cats.Lymphosarcoma is the
most common spinal tumor of cats, according to a number of sources in the literature. Menin-
gioma and MNST usually are typically located intradurally, but occasionally will exhibit an
cxtradural pattern on myelography or other imaging modalities (CT/MR). Metastatic carcinomas
(e.g, mammary carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma) may localize to the extradural space. A number
of fatty tumors havebcen reported to affect the spinal cord in dogs,including lipoma,myeloli
poma, infiltrative lipoma, and liposarcoma. These all generally occur in an extradural location,
although a myxoid liposarcoma was reported to occur in an intradural extramedullary location in
a dog. Extradural tumors represent the most frequently diagnosed category of spinal neoplasia
(Fig. 10.31).
b.Intradural/extramedullary tumors: Meningiomas and MNSTs are the two most common neo-
plasms in this category, with meningiomas predominating. An uncommon blast cell tumor of
young dogs called nepbroblastoma also typically displays an intradural/extramedullary pattern on
spinal imaging (Fig. 10.32).
C.Intramedullary tumors: These infrequently encountered neoplasms include primary spinal
parenchymal tumors (e.g, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, ependymoma) and intramedullary
metastases. The most common intramedullary metastases in dogs are thought to be hemangiosar-
coma and lymphosarcoma. In one study, hemangiosarcoma was the most common tumor type in
the intramedullary category.
d.Mixed compartment tumors: These tumors tend to occur in more than one of the three typical
compartments listed above. Malignant nerve sheath tumor is the most common type of neo-
plasm in this category, followed by lymphosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. There
are isolated reports of spinal germ cell tumors in dogs, one of which fit the criteria for a teratoma
(differentiated to the level of three separate germ cel derivatives endoderm, mesoderm, ecto-
derm). These tumors were primarily intramedullary, but they also occupicd intradural and
extraduralcompartments.

2. In general, most patients with spinal neoplasia are older (e.g., more than 5 years), but some tumors
(lymphosarcoma, nephroblastoma) are seen commonly in young animals. Spinal tumors appear to be
much more common in larger dogs than in small-breed dogs. The median age of cats with spinal
lymphosarcoma is 2-3 years. Spinal nephroblastomas in dogs are typically diagnosed between 6
months and 3 years of age. These uncommon neoplasms have been ascribed multiple names, includ-
ing neuroepithelioma, medulloepithelioma, and ependymoma.It is unlikely that this neoplasm is an
ependymoma, and most evidence supports the use of the term nepbroblastoma. German Shepherd

lary neoplasms.Rapid onset of clinical signs may be due to such factors as pathologic fracture of a
cancerous vertebra,acutehemorrhage ornecrosisof a tumor,orrapid growth ofaneoplasm with
subsequent damage to spinal cord parenchyma (more likely with intramedullary tumors). Spinal cord
tumors are typically solitary and can occur anywhere along the length of the spine. Meningiomas
and MNSTs arise most frequently in the cervical spinal cord, with MNSTs being especially promi-
nent in the cervical intumescence area.Feline lymphosarcoma is found more often in the thoraco
lumbar spine than the cervical spine.The vast majority of reported nephroblastomas of young dogs
have been located between T10 and L2 vertebral levels.
A prominentfeature ofextradural andintradural/extramedullary spinalneoplasia isspinal
hyperesthesia, which ofen precedes the onset of proprioceptive and voluntary motor deficits. Spinal
hyperesthesia is often not a prominent early clinical feature in patients with intramedullary spinal
tumors, probably due to the lack of meningeal involvement. In MNSTs of the cervical intumescence,
a history of unilateral thoracic limb lameness (on the side of the tumor) preceding the development
of clinical signs ofmyelopathy is common.
3.A tentative diagnosis of spinal neoplasia is typically based upon signalment, history, clinical signs,
and results of spinal imaging. Blood work abnormalities are unlikely,but hyperglobulinemia and
proteinuria may be evident in cases of myeloma.Most cats with spinal lymphosarcoma are FeLV
positive, have leukemic bone marrow, and have multicentric neoplasia. With the possible exception
of spinal lymphosarcoma, CSF evaluation rarely reveals neoplastic cellsand may reveal increased

protein levels, with or without elevated cell counts (more likely with tumors with meningeal involve-
ment). In cases of vertebral neoplasia, bony lysis with loss of cortical outlines is often seen on
imaging of affected vertebrae, with or without evidence of bony proliferation (Fig. 10.33). In the
majority of soft tissue spinal neoplasms,plain radiographs of the spine arenormal.Myelography, CT,
or MR imaging (Fig. 10.34) are usually helpful both in diagnosis of spinal tumors and therapeutic
planning. An intramedullary myelographic paern may be misleading, as an intradural/extramedul-
lary mass with attendant cord swelling may cause an identical pattern on myelography or advanced
imaging (e.g., CT or MRI). Intradural/extramedullary spinal tumors will occasionally infiltrate the
spinal cord parenchyma(mixed compartment mass),which may contribute to the development of an
intramedullary imaging pattern.
It is important to realize that both meningiomas and MNSTs tend to be associated with an intra-
dural extramedullary pattern. Also, both tumors appear to have a predilection for the cervical spinal
cord. In some cases of MNST, an enlarged intervertebral foramen evident on radiographs, CT, or MRI,
366
A PRACTICAL GUIDETO CANINEAND FELINE NEUROLOGY
and/or an enlarged nerve root identifiable with CT or MRI,may help in distinguishing a rumor as
being a MNS'T rather than meningioma. The absence of such distinguishing imaging results, however,
does not rule out the possibility of MNST. Definitive diagnosis of spinal tumors in all cases requires
histopathologic cvaluation of affccted tissue. This is usually not feasible without surgical intervention.
However,fuoroscopic or CT-guided needle biopsy may provide a diagnosis in some cases.
4.As with brain tumors, therapy for dogs and cats with spinal tumors can be divided into supportive
and definitive treatments. Supportive therapies are directed against secondary sequelae of the spinal
rumor (e.g., cord edema, pain), whereas definitive therapies are aimed at elimination of neoplastic
tissue. Supportive therapy consists of anti-infammatory doses of glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone,
0.5mg/kg,PO,q 12 hr),which can be increased or decreased as needed,with or without additional
pain-relieving drugs (e.g., narcotics). Definitive therapy consists primarily of surgery and megavoltage
radiation therapy, similar to brain tumor definitive therapy (see Chapter 5). Chemotherapy is
indicated for lymphosarcoma and myeloma. There are no reports describing the use of chemotherapy
for other spinal neoplasms (e.g., gliomas) in dogs and cats.
The prognosis for dogs and cats with spinal neoplasia treated with supportive therapy alone is
poor. Although data are lacking, these patients willikely be euthanized because of progressive spinal
cord dysfunction within several weeks to several months, depending on the tumor type. For most
canine and feline spinal tumors, there is a lack of meaningful prognostic information based upon
large numbers of cases in which definitive therapy was pursued. With the exception of lymphosar-
coma, there is a notable absence of prognostic information pertaining to feline spinal ncoplasia. In
one report, prognostic data concerning nonlymphoid spinal neoplasia in 11 cats were described.
Several of the cats experienced prolonged remissions following surgical intervention, including 1 cat
with osteosarcoma, 1 with chondrosarcoma, 1 with a MNST, and 1 with meningioma, with survival
times of approximately 57 months, 12 months, 73 months, and 47 months, respectively. The

radiation therapy is the recommended definitive therapy for spinal lymphoma, the majority of both
feline and canine cases will be cuthanized within 3 months due to progressive or recurrent disease,
despite therapy. The limited information available concerning spinal meningiomas suggests remission
times exceeding 6 months are likely with surgical therapy alone; adjunctive radiation therapy is likely
to extend remission times for this tumor to 12 months or more. In one report, the mean survival
time for six dogs with spinal meningioma treated with surgery and radiation therapy was approxi-
mately15months.
The prognosis for surgical removal/debulking of canine spinal MNSTs appears to be poor.
Median postoperative survival is approximatcly 5-6 months, with a disease-free interval of only
about 1 month, The efficacy/inefficacy of postoperative radiation therapy for spinal MNSTs has not
yetbeen establishedfor dogs or cats.There are several reports of successful surgicalremoval of
nephroblastomas in young dogs, only a few of which report long-term follow-up; it is thought that
recurrence of the tumor is likely within 6--12 rnonths in sonme cases. Thcre is also some evidence that

spinal nephroblastomas may at times invade the spinal cord parenchyma. Adjunctive therapy (i.e.,
radiation therapy, chermotherapy) for this neoplasm remains to be investigated. Intramedullary spinal
neoplasia is uncommon. The prognosis for dogs and cats with these tumors is considered poor,
although definitive therapy has not been thoroughly described.
'There are a number of reports of surgical removal of lipomatous spinal cord masses in dogs.
Although the overallsuccess rate of surgery appears to be favorable, even with infiltrative lipoimas
and liposarcomas, postoperative radiationi therapy may be advisable with these latter two tumor types
in order to achieve good long-term results.
D. Nutritional
1. Feline hypervitaminosis A6s,22u,328
a.Feline hypcrvitaminosis A is an uncommon disease of adult cars (2-10 years old) fed a die with
excess vitamin A. These diets typically consist primarily of liver. Confluent exostoses of multiple
bones, including cervical and thoracic vertebrac, form the basis for clinical signs.
b. Clinical signs of neck pain and rigidirty, lameness, and reluctancc to move are common. The
cervical vertebral exostoses can compress spinal nerves, leading to hypcresthesia.
C. Changing the diet may halt furthcr progression of the disease, but the prognosis for recovery is
poor.
3.A unique myelopathy has been described in hunting dogs in Europe. English Foxhounds,
Harricrs, and Beagles have been reported to develop a diffuse myelopathy that is associated with
being fed a diet composed primarily or exclusively of ruminant (cow and sheep) stomachs for at
least 6 months. The predorninant lesion is spinal cord demyelination, with relatively mild axonal
damage. Affected dogs have significantly lower scrum methionine levels and significantly higher
liver methionine synthetasc activiry in comparison with age-marched controls fcd a balanccd diet.
The dietary-induced methionine deficiency is believed to cause a disruption of spinal cord
myelin integrity.
gradual onset of mild paraparesis and pelvic limb ataxia is typical, and the gait often worsens
with cxercise. There is often exaggerated fexion of the pelvic limbs during ambulation. Another
characteristic feature of this disorder is a loss of panniculus (cutaneous trunci) reflex caudal to
the thoracolumbar junction area of the spine.
C.Diagnosis of this condition is based primarily upon dietary history combined with characteristic
clinical signs of a progressive T3-L3 myclopathy. Blood work and urinalysis results are within
normal limits, as are results of CSF analysis and myelography. Serum methionine levels are
abnormally low, and liver methionine synthetase levels are abnormally elevated. In dogs that were
euthanizcd for this condition, histopathologic evidence of demyelination with minor axonal
damage is appreciated throughout white matter of thc spinal cord as well as some brain stem
areas.
d. Treatment of the condition is switching affected dogs to a balanced dict, The prognosis for full
recovery is favorable aftcr instirution of sound feeding practices.
E.Infammatory/infectious
1. Diskospondylitis22402
Diskospondylitis is an infection of the intervertebral disk and surrounding vertebral endplates
that is usually caused by bacteria. The most cominon bacteria incrininated are Stapbylococus species.
Other bactcria and fungal organisrns have also been reported to cause diskospondylitis. A pathologi-
cally similar, but radiographically distinct disorder, called vertebral physitis has also been described.
Any vertebral level can be affected, but the L7-S1 space is one of the most common. I'his disease
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 11.

a.Noninfectious causes-granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) is discussed in detail in
Chapter 5. Occasionally, clinical signs of myelopathy predominate in GME patients, especially
signs of cervical myelopathy.A number of other infammatory conditions in which clinical signs
of myelopathy predominate and for which no infectious organism has been identified have been
described:
(1) Corticosteroid responsive (aseptic) meningitis: This usually occurs in young (less than 2 years
old), medium- to large-breed dogs and may be the most common type of meningitis encoun-

pressive doses of prednisone (24 mg/kg/day) usually results in rapid improvement. These
patients should be slowly weaned off the prednisone over a number of months (e.g., 3-6
months), but in the author's experience, approximately one-half of these dogs will require
some level of long-term immunosuppressive therapy; most of the dogs requiring such
extended therapy can be weaned to a very low dose of drug. There are anecdotal reports of
successfully using other immunomodulatory drugs for this disorder (e.g., azathioprine,
cyclosporine), especially for cases of relapse. The prognosis for control of clinical signs with
this discase is typically excellent. A major rule-out for a suppurative pleocytosis is bacterial
meningitis (see Chapter 5). Concurrent therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics may be
warranted if the diagnosis is questionable.
(2) Necrotizing vasculitis: A severe meningitis ormeningomyelitis, characterized by vasculitis of
meningeal vessels, has been described in young (less than 12 months old) Bernese Mountain
Dogs, Beagle dogs, and German Shorthaired Pointer dogs. Clinical fcatures include neck

(3)Pyogranulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis:A severe,usually rapidly (over 2-3 weeks)
progressive disorder, primarily involving the caudal brain stem and cranial cervical spinal
cord, has been described in mature pointer dogs. Infammatory lesions occur in the meninges
and parenchyma of the brain and spinal cord. Clinical signs typically suggest a painful
cervical myelopathy. Other reported signs include trigeminal and facial nerve paralysis,
vestibular dysfunction (e.g., head tilt, nystagmus), Horner's syndrome, seizures, vomiting, and
bradycardia.A predominantly neutrophilic pleocytosis with elevated protein levels is a
prognosis is poor.
(4) Aseptic meningitis/polyarthritis of Akita dogs: Two of eight young (less than 8 months old)
Akita dogs with a syndrome similar to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in people had evidence
of aseptic meningitis.One pup responded poorly to immunosuppressive therapy, and one
pup was euthanized (no therapy attempted).

demonstrated by a CBC. Antenortcm diagnosis is difficult, and the prognosis is poor.
b.Infectious causes (see also Chapter 5): Appropriate references dealing with diagnosing and treating
infecrious diseases should be consulted for more detail. All ofthe following infectious diseases may
resultin clinical signs of myelopathy, with or without signs suggesting brain dysfunction:
(1) Viruses, such as canine distemper virus, feline coronavirus (FIP).
(2) Bacteria, such as Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, and coliforms. An apparently
rare discase syndrome called spinal epidural empyema has been reported to cause a severe
myelopathy in a number of dogs and one cat. The route of infection of the epidural space
cases were imaged via myclography, which showed evidence of extensive purulent epidural
fuid accumulation, typically over several vertebral lengths. These purulent accumulations can
be more focal and can also be multifocal along the length of the spinal cord. Both MR and
CT have ben used to image this condition in veterinary medicine, but MR imaging is the
preferred modality. Hallmarks of this disorder are spinal hyperesthesia, fever, and often
rapidly progressing paresis or plegia. Lethargy and anorexia have also been describcd in many
of the reported cases. Peripheral neutrophilia apparcnt on a CBC is a consistcnt laboratory
finding in patients with spinal epicdural empyema. A moderate neutrophilic pleocytosis withi
clcvated protein concentration is likely on CSF analysis. CSF culture is typically negative, but
cultures from blood and epidural fuid are often positive. I'here may or may not be radio-
graphic evidence of verrebral osteonyelitis or diskospondylitis. The key to successful rnanage.
ment of this disorder appears to be rapid diagnosis and aggressive medical and surgical
treatment. Although somewhat controversial, spinal epidural empyema is considered by most
sources as a surgical emergency, with delayed diagnosis and treatment often leading to poor
outcormes. Despite the high level of morbidity and mortality associated with this condition,
successful outcomes are likely if expedient surgical decompression and treatment with broad-
spectrum antibiotics (based on culture/sensitivity result) is undertaken.

F.Ischemic/vascular
1.Fibrcagnumlmya66502431149
a.Fibrocarrilaginous cmbolic myelopathy (FCE) is a common syndrome caused by the emboliza-
tion of arrerial and/or venous supply to an area of the spinal cord. The embolizing material has
been identified as fibrocartilage and is believed to originate from the nucleus pulposus of the
intervertebral disk. The mechanism (or mechanisms) by which this material reaches the spinal
cord vasculature from the disk is unknown. Theories center around either venous entry of disk
material (e.g., extrusion either directly into a venous sinus or venous system of vertebral bonc
marrow-a Schmorl's node) with retrograde movement into the spinal arterial system or direct
ization over the annulus fbrosus associated with concomitant type II disk degeneration).

One study rcported that FCE is the most common cause of myelopathy in Miniature Schnauzers.
Age of onsct of clinical signs ranges from the juvenile to the elderly, but most dogs presenting with
FCE are young to middle-aged (1- to 7-years-old) adults. A number of juvenile (8-13 weeks old)
Irish Wolfhounds with FCE were described in one report. Most of the reported cats with FCE
have been middle-aged to older at presentation (7-12 years of age), and the majority were domes-
tic shorthaired cats.Most of the reported feline FCE cases have involved the cervical spinal cord,
but the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral cord segments have been affected. The FCE patient
typically presents with a history of peracute to acute onsct and progression of clinical signs. Most
patients willreach peak severity of neurologic dysfunction within 24 hours, many within 6 hours
or less. Rarcly, animals with FCE may develop dysfunction over several days. Owners often observe
the affcted dog.to cry out in apparent pain during exercise ora mild traumatic event shortly
before the onset of neurologic dysfunction.These dogs are often not in any detectable pain by the
time they are presented to the clinician. In one study, it was found that spinal hyperesthesia could
be elicited in 21% of dogs with FCE. It is the author's experience that spinal hyperesthesia can
often be elicited in FCE patients that are examined soon after the onset of neurologic dysfunction.
Clinical signs of myelopathy willvary, depending upon both the location and severity of the spinal
cord ischemic injury. Deficits are often asymmetric with FCE, and the clinical signs of dysfunction
are typically not progressive after the first 24 hours of infarction.
C。
 Diagnosis of FCE is based upon history, signalment, clinical signs, and ruling out other causes of
acute myelopathy. Results of plain radiography, CSF evaluation, and myelography are typically
normal. Myelographic evidence of spinal cord swelling (intramedullary pattern) and nonspecific
CSF abnormalities (e.g., elevated protein level, mild pleocytosis, xanthochromia) may be seen in
some cases. The prefered method of imaging for patients with suspected spinal cord infarcts is
MR imaging (Fig. 10.35); focal, sharply demarcated, hyperintense parenchymal lesions (sus-
pected to be edematous, infarcted tissue) on T2-weighted and FLAIR images are characteristic.
These lesions are isointense or hypointense to the spinal cord on T1-weighted images and may
display varying degrees ofcontrast enhancement(usually mild enhancementwhen present);the
presence or absence of contrast enhanccment may be related to the timing of MR imaging after
the infarct occurs, often occurring about a week after injury in hunans with FCE. The FCE
lesions are often primarily within the gray matter of the spinal cord and unilateral in location. In
one study of 52 dogs with suspected FCE, 11 dogs (21%) did not have any lesions apparent on
MR imaging. The appearance of lesions on MR imaging in this study was not associated with
timing of imaging after infarction (in people, ischemic lesions may not be apparent on MR
imaging within the first 48 hours of the infarct), but was significantly associated with severity of
neurologic dysfunction; ambulatory dogs were much more likely to have normal MRI results
than nonambulatory dogs. This study also found a positive association between disease severity
and lesion cxtent on MR imaging. Thc lesions were measured both in length (sagittal images
expressed as a ratio over C6 or L2 vertebral length for cervical/cervicothoracic and thoracolum-
bar/lumbosacral lesions, respectively) and cross-sectional area (transaxial images expressed as a
percentage of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord in the area of infarction).
d.Treatment usually consists of early glucocorticoid administration (sec Chapter 12) and physical
therapy, the latter of which may be protracted. As discussed further in Chapter 12, the clinical
value of glucocorticoid therapy in treating spinal cord injury is questionable at best. Another
potential treatment option for these dogs is polyethylcne glycol (PEG; discussed in disk disease
section of this chapter and in Chapter 12). There is some evidence that controlled physiotherapy
(e.g, underwater treadmill) has a positivc impact on neurologic recovery in dogs with FCE. The
prognosis for functional recovery for dogs with FCE is extremely variable, refecting the variabil-
ity in lesion severity characteristic of this disease. In addition, recovery rates for these dogs vary

considerably among published studies. Most of the recent literature suggests an overall guarded
to good prognosis for dogs with FCE, whereas older literature is more pessimistic.For nonambu-
Negative prognostic indicators reported include lossof dep pain erception (nocicption), severe
LMN damage, and owner reluctance to pursue prolonged physical therapy. Some reports disagree
with the assertion that LMN damage portends a worse prognosis than UMN spinal cord damage
in FCE cases. The degree of owner reluctance to pursue physical therapy is often associated with
the size of the dog (e.g., prolonged physical therapy and bladder management for a paralyzed
Great Dane may not be feasible for many owners). The mortality rate for large- and giant-breed
dogs with FCE was reported as 64% in one study. Conversely, in another study, the overall
neurologic recovery rate was 65.3%. In another more recent report of 50 dogs, 84% (42 dogs)
had successful outcomes. In this study, the extent of the lesion as measured on MRIs was predic-
tive of outcome; dogs with a lesion length/vertebral length ratio (sagittal images; see previous
discussion) less than or equal to 2 or a cross-sectional (transaxial images) lesion area/spinal cord
area percentage less than 67% were significantly more likely to recover than dogs that had higher
associated with a negative outcome in this study. The median time to maximal neurologic
recovery for these dogs was 3.75 months. In the report on Miniature Schnauzers, only 22% of
the cases were euthanized.While many of the surviving dogs regained functional status,most
retained some neurologic deficits. It appears that although FCE in dogs may be associated with a
substantial level of morbidity and mortality, a large proportion of dogs may recover neurologic
function following the infarct.

APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINEAND FELINE NEUROLOGY
Many of the cats diagnosed with FCE were euthanized shortly following presentation due to
presumptive FCE in cats in which the patients made a functional recovery. The prognosis for
FCE in cats may be similar to dogs, but more cases will need to be followed to determine this.
In addition to the reports of suspected or confirmed feline FCE cases, the author and colleagues
have described MR imaging and clinical features of 1l acutely nonambulatory tetraparetic cats
with suspected cervical infarcts (all based on characteristic MRI lesions). These were all older
evidence of a C6-T2 myclopathy.Six ofthe 8catswith C1-C5 lesions had cervicalvcntroflex-
ion and were unable to hold up their heads or move the head and neck voluntarily. The cats
the C1-C2 vertebral level. Nine cats had preexisting medical conditions that may have predis-
posed theim to spinal cord infarction, including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperthyroidism,
and chronic renal failure.Although for some of these cats having FCE may have been the cause
for infarction, there may bc other potential causes for spinal cord infarction in cats. Eight of
these 11 cats regained ambulatory function within 2 months of presentation.
2.Traumatic feline ischemic myelopathy391
A syndrome of acute pelvic limb paralysis from ischemic myelopathy, associated with evidence of
abdominal injury, has been described in cats. The ischemic cord damage is thought to be due to
posed cause is compressive injury to the abdomen from an automobile tire. Treatment of this
disorder has not been reported
G.Toxic
Both strychnine and the exotoxin tetanospasmin from Clostridium tetani act at the spinal cord level to
produce clinical signs of muscle rigidity. These similar disorders will bc discussed in Chapter 15, since they
 present clinically as disorders of muscle tone.

Miscellaneous
An idiopathic disorder of young, large-breed dogs has been described in which partially calcified
fbrous masses develop in periarticular connective tissue along the spine (Fig. 10.36). These are often
solitary masses at the atlantoaxial or upper thoracic interverrcbral levels. This disorder is histologi-
cally distinct from solitary osteochondromas. Clinical signs of myelopathy depend upon lesion
location and extent. Prognosis is favorable with surgical removal.
2. Dural ossification220.441
Dural ossification is an idiopathic deposition of bony plaques on the inner surfacc of the dura
mater, especially in older dogs. Radiographically, these plaques appear as radiopaque lines and are
best seen at the intervertebral foraminal level. This is almost always an incidental finding, as it is
rarely incriminated as causing clinical disease.
In the vast majority of cases,spondylosis deformans is a common degenerativeprocess of the
spine, with no clinical significance. Exostoses form around the ventral vertebral end-plate margins,
sometimes resulting in a bony bridge between adjacent vertebrae. This is a noninfamimatory condi-
tion believed to be associated with degenerative changes in the annulus fibrosus of the intervertcbral
disks and is probably due to chronic mild instability at affected disk spaces.This can be observed in
adult animals of various sizes and ages, but tends to be more prominent in middle-agcd to older
medium- to giant-breed dogs.The margins of the exostoses are usually smooth. Spondylosis is often
associated with type II disk protrusions, especially at the lumbosacral junction, but by itself it is not

animportant clinical entity.There is no association betwecn spondylosis deformans and the occur
rence or location of type I disk extrusions in dogs,and it isnotconsidered a clinically important
phenomenon in such cases. This syndrome must be distinguished from diskospondylitis (Chapter
11).
Disseminated idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) refers to cxtensive periarticular calcification
and ossification throughout thebody,including the vertebrae.It is thought that,for some unknown
reason, DISH patients have an exaggerated bony proliferative response to minor bone stresses. DISH
has been described in two dogs, a 4-year-old male Labrador Retriever and a 4-year-old female Great
Dane. The radiographic lesions were similar to those reported in people with the same disorder. The
characteristic radiographic appearance of vertebrae in patients with DISH is “Howing” ossfication
primarily attheventrolateralaspectofthespine,extendingfor atleastfour contiguousvertebrac
(Fig. 10.37). There may also be ossification of the interspinous ligaments dorsally. Ossification at
374
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
areas of ligamentous attachments (enthesiophytes) is also characteristic. Despite the extensive periar
ticular formation of new bone, the joints themselves are normal (i.c., no degenerative joint disease).
Clinical signs of gait abnorimalities and decreased joint mobility reflect the restrictive effects of the
periarticular bone formation.There is no known effective treatment for this enigmatic disorder.

DISORDERSOFTHECAUDAEQUINA
Curtis W. Dewey
1.
Clinical Signs of Cauda Equina Dysfunction
The variety of terms used to describe this area of the spine can lead to confusion.In this text, the cauda
equina is defined as the leash of nerve roots derived from the terminal spinal cord segments from L7
caudally (Cd1-Cd5) that travels through the vertebral canal in the lumbosacral area. The lumbosacral area,
or lumbosacral junction, is defined as the bone (e.g., L7 vertebra, sacrum) and connective tissue (e.g., L7-
S1 articular facet joint capsules, interarcuate ligament, disk) enclosing the cauda equina. As with myelopa-
thies, clinical signs associated with cauda equina dysfiunction depend upon the location (*sidedness") and
extent of the lesion. Typical signs of dysfunction associated with cauda equina disorders are listed below.
The clinician should bear in mind that lesions of the spinal cord segments that give rise to the cauda cquina
can result in identical clinical signs of dysfunction as will lesions of their respective nerve roots.
A. Hyperesthesia, paresthesia/dysesthesia
1. Hyperesthesia (pain) may arise from compression and/or inflammation of meninges and nerve roots
of the cauda equina, from the bony components of the lumbosacral area, from the L7-S1 disk, and
from L7S1 articular facet joint capsules. Hyperesthesia may be rmanifested in a number of ways.
Some patients exhibit obvious discomfort when rising or sirting down. Others may be reluctant to
jump or climb stairs. A unilareral or bilateral pelvic limb lameness, which may be exacerbated by
increased activity, may also indicate hyperesthesia in the arca of the lumbosacral joint and cauda
equina. With some conditions, the patient may appear to be in constant pain (e.g, diskospondylitis,
vertebral tumor),whereas in others, careful palpation of the lumbosacral area is required to elicit a
painful response from the patient.
2.Paresthesia/dysesthesia are two similar terms that describe abnormal sensations caused by irritation or
trauma to sensory nerves or nerve roots. Human patients describe such sensations as pricking,
burning,and tingling. These occur without any known external sensory stimulus.It cannot be
proven whether or not such sensations occur in dogs and cats with cauda equina disorders, but
historical complaints and clinical signs often suggest the existence of this phenomenon. Dogs with
cauda equina disorders will sometimes stare or bite at areas around the rump and pelvic limbs.
B. Proprioceptive deficits
Interference with afferent proprioceptive fibers at the level of the cauda equina can produce various degrees
of proprioceptive deficits to the pelvic limbs. This can be as mild as delayed proprioceptive positioning
reactions or as severe as pelvic limb ataxia with dragging the dorsal aspect of the toes (*knuckling"). The
deficits may or may not be symmetric.
C. Voluntary motor deficits: Motor deficits to the muscles innervated by the sciatic nerve and caudal
(coccygeal-tail innervation) nerves imay be clinically detectable, as the cord segments and nerve roots of
the cauda cquina give rise to these nerves. Pelvic limb weakness may be apparent with damage to sciatic
nerve contributions, and decreased to absent tail tone and movement may occur with damage to caudal
segments and/or nerve roots. In some cases, the patient may be observed to exhibit an abnormally low
tail carriage, which is often noticed by the owner.
D. Abnormal reflex activity: Decreased to absent withdrawal and gastrocnemius refexes may be appreciated.
The patellar reflex is typically normal or may appear hyperreffexive. Caudal thigh muscles normally

inhibit the action of the quadriceps muscle group when the patellar reflex is elicited. Removal of this
tonic antagonistic influence by disrupting the nerve supply to the caudal thigh muscles may result in an
apparently hyperactive patellar reflex (i.e., patellar pseudohyperreflexia). A decreased to absent perineal
reflex may result from cauda equina lesions.
E. Urinary and fecal abnormalities: Varying degrees of urinary and fecal incontinence may occut with
damage to sacral segments and/or roots. Bladder dysfunction is classically lower motor neuron (LMN) in
nature (see Chapter 13).
F.Nociceptive (pain perception) deficits: Nociceptive deficits in areas of the pelvic limbs (see Chapter 14
for autonomous zones), perineum, and tail may occur with sevcre lesions of the cauda equina.
Il.
Disorders Affecting the Cauda Equina in Dogs and Cats (see Table 11.1)
A.Degenerative
a.This is a common disease syndrome that typically affects adult (usually middle-aged to older),
large-breed dogs. According to some reports, there is a male predilection for this disease. The
German Shepherd dog appears to be particularly predisposed to degenerative lumbosacral
stenosis. The pathogenesis involves type I degeneration and subsequent protrusion of the L7-S1
intervertebral disk into the vertebral canal (Fig. 11.1). Thcre are often other degenerative changes
at the lumbosacral junction indicative of chronic instability at this articulation. Ventral spondylo
sis is often appreciated at the lumbosacral junction in these patients, but by itself, this radio-
graphic finding has little clinical significance. Some of the degenerative changes, othcr than disk
protrusion,that may lead to compression of the cauda equina include
(1) collapse of the intervertebral disk space at L7-S1 and subluxation of the L7-S1 articular
facets. The craniodorsal aspcct of the sacrum may become displaced ventral to the caudodor-
sal aspect of the L7 vcrtcbra.
(2) hypertrophy and folding inward (ventrlly) of the interarcuate ligament (ligamentum flavum)
located between the dorsal laminae of L7 and S1.
11 / DISORDERS OF THE CAUDA EQUINA
Fig. ll.1, Schematic illustration depicting a protrnding disk at the L7-Sl intcrvcrrcbral disk space. (llustration by Carol
Rudowsky)
(3) hypertrophy of soft tissuc structures (e.g. joint capsule) as well as osteophyte formation
associated with the I7-S1 articular facets.
 Reasons for this chronic degenerative process are unknown. In German Shepherd dogs as
well as other large-breed dogs, the presence of transitional vertebrae at the lumbosacral
junction has been associated with development of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis. In one
study, dogs witch transitional lumbosacral vertebrac were cight times more likely to develop
degenerative lumbosacral stenosis than dogs without such anomalous vertebrae; in this samc
study, dogs with transitional lumbosacral vertebrae also developed clinical signs of degenera-
tive lumbosacral stcnosis 1-2 ycars earlier than dogs with lumbosacral stenosis that did not
have these abnormal verrcbrac. The German Shepherd breed was also found to be eight times
more likely to develop degenerative lumbosacral stenosis than other large breeds in this
investigation, In addition, German Shepherd dogs have been shown to have different orienita
tion of vertebral articular processes (facers) in the caudal lumbar and lumbosacral regions of
the spinal column and a greater degree of facet joint topism in this region, compared with
other large-breed dogs. Facet joint tropism means an asymmetry in the angle of orientation
between left and right facets at a given levcl of articulation. Thesc anatomic differcnccs, as
well as the propensity for German Shephcrd dogs to have transitional lumbosacral vertebrae,
may partly explain the breed prevalencc for degenerative lumbosacral stenosis.
b. Clinical signs arc variable, but lumbosacral pain is an early and consistent finding. Pain may be
manifested in a numher of ways, such as reluctance to rise or sit and unilateral or bilateral pelvic
limb lameness. Pain and lameness may be acute or chronic and may be persistent or episodic.
I'hese clinical signs may be misinterpreted as being duc to orthopedic discasc, most notably hip
dysplasia. Many of these dogs have radiographic cvidence of hip dysplasia, making this a particu-
larly casy trap to fallinto when the only obvious clinical sign of an abnormality is pain and/or
pelvic limb lameness. If untreated, clinical signs of dysfunction may progress to proprioceptive
loss in the pclvic limbs, voluntary motor weakness (in the distribution area of the sciatic nerve),
and urinary/fecal incontincncc,usually in that order. In the author's experience, defcient pelvic
limb withdrawal refexes arc most apparent at the hock level in cases of degenerative lumbosacral
stenosis; Hexion at the hip and stife regions often appears nornal. Although typicaly indicative
of progressively severe cauda equina compression, incontinence, urinary and/or fecal, occasionally
is the initial primary clinical complaint in cases of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis. Careful
palpation of the lumbosacral area, including lordosing the caudal spine while pressing on the
lumbosacral area, will usually elicit a pain response in affected patients (Fig. 11.2). Most dogs

afficted with this disease also have obvious deficits on proprioceptive positioning tests of the
pelviclimbs.
Diagnosis of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis is based upon signalment, historical and clinical
findings, and results of diagnostic imaging of the lumbosacral region.The definitive diagnosis of
degenerative lumbosacral stenosis is made by imaging of the lumbosacral area and demonstrating
compression of the cauda equina. Although degenerative changes at the lumbosacral junction (e.
g., spondylosis, malalignment of the sacrum with the L7 vertebra) may often be appreciated on
plain radiographs of the region, additional imaging is necessary to demonstrate cauda equina
compression.A number of procedures have been advocated, including myelography, cpidurogra-
phy, vertebral sinus venography, diskography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging. Since the terminal thecal sac (subarachnoid space) of the spinal cord in
large-breed dogs often ends cranial to the lumbosacral junction, myelography (Fig. 11.3) may
not consistently provide useful information.Vertebral sinus venography is considered to be both
a technically diffcult and unreliable imaging procedure. Diskography (Fig. 11.4) is an accurate
imaging method for degenerative lumbosacral stenosis but provides information primarily limited
to the intervertebral disk. Epidurography is also considered to be a relatively accurate contrast
11.5) has also been demonstrated to be a useful diagnostic imaging method for degenerative
lumbosacral stenosis. In the author's experience, CT (Fig. 11.6) and MR imaging (Fig. 11.7)
provide the most detailed structural information regarding the cauda equina, including informa-
tion concerning the L7-S1 intervertebral foramina and L7 nerve roots. In one study, there was a
high degree of agreement between CT and MRI findings in dogs with degenerative lumbosacral

stenosis;however, the findings of neither of these modalities correlated well with what was found
at surgery. Although this discrepancy may be partially explained by differences in patient posi-
tioning during imaging versus surgery, there are other important discrepancies between imaging
findings and clinical disease that must be kept in mind. Most importantly, there is evidence that
dogs without clinical signs of discasc may have imaging findings consistent with a diagnosis of
degencrative lumbosacral stenosis and that the degree of cauda equina compression evident on
imaging doesnot correlatewith diseasepresence or severity.Inone studyofneurologically
normal dogs imaged via CT, all dogs had some level of disk protrusion at the L7-S1 disk space;
the percentage of the vertebral canal height occupied by these disks varied from approximately
21% to 43%. It is apparent that evidence on imaging studies consistent with a diagnosis of
degenerative lumbosacral stenosis may be an incidental finding in some dogs. It is also apparent
ily indicative of disease severity in patients that exhibit clinical signs of degenerative lumbosacral
stenosis. In the author's experience, middle-aged to older large-breed dogs often demonstrate
hyperesthesia on palpation of the lumbosacral junction during a neurologic examination that has
nothing to dowith thepresenting complaint orultimate diagnosis.In otherwords,some dogs
with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis may have subtle or inapparent clinical signs that are only
elicited on palpation. It is imperative to realize that focusing on the lumbosacral junction in
some patients may lead to overlooking another spinal disorder that is primarily responsible for
the clinical deficits. In patients with subtle deficits (e.g., pelvic limb proprioceptive deficits and
spinal hyperesthesia), it may be worthwhile to have a survey image of the thoracolumbar region
(e.g, T2-sagittal MR survey) to cnsure that the lumbosacral lesion is not an incidental finding.
Concurrent elcctromyography (EMG) performed on the epaxial, tail, and pelvic limb muscula-
ture may improve the accuracy of diagnosis with the various imaging modalities. Tibial nerve
somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) have also been shown to be abnormal in dogs with
clinical evidence of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis.
d. Treatment of the patient with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis may be nonsurgical or surgical,
similar to other disk-associated diseases. Treatment decisions are based primarily on severity of
clinical signs; as mentioned previously, there appears to be no clear correlation between extent of
cauda equina compression evident on imaging and discase severity or postoperative outcome.
Nonsurgical therapy consists of enforced rest and anti-inflammatory medication (either nonste-
roidal drugs or prednisone, not both) and is often recommended for dogs with signs of hyperes-
thesia only. Nonsurgical therapy tends to be either transiently effective or ineffective for this
discasc.

hypertrophied soft tissue (e.g., annular disk material). Enlargement of the L7-S1 intervertebral

zation of the lumbosacral joint, but this may be advisable in some cases (e.g., bilateral facetec
with surgical intervention. Successful outcomes after surgery have bccn reported in 78%-94% of
cases. It appears that although improvement in continence may occur in dogs with presurgical
fecal and/or urinary incontinencc (over weeks to months following surgery),resolution of
incontinence is not likely to occur in most cases. Incontinence failed to resolve after decompres-
sive surgery in 55%-87% of reported cases, In one study, presurgical incontinence was the only
clinical feature correlated with a poor postoperative outcome. Improvement or resolution of
incontinence was found to be much less likely in dogs that had been incontinent for more than
1 month, compared to those that had shorter histories of incontinence. Reported recurrence rates
for degenerative lurmbosacral stenosis vary between 3% and 18%. Recurrence is probably more
likely in very active dogs (i.e., working dogs).
2.Type 1 degenerative disk disease
a.Occasionally, type I disk extrusions will occur in a caudal lumbar disk, leading to signs of cauda
cquina dysfunction.
b. Clinical signs of pain and dysfunction tend to occur acurely, sinilar to type I disk extrusions in
other spinal locations, Pelvic limb “root signature” (see Chapter 10) may occur with lateralized
type I disk extrusions in the caudal lumbar region. In the author's experience, pelvic limb root
signature associated with lareralized caidal lumbar disk cxtrusions is most commonly seen in
Cocker Spaniels.
C.Specifics regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with type I disk disease are
discussed in Chapter 10. Diagnostic imaging other than myelography (e.g., diskography, epidur-
ography, CT, MR) may be neccssary to demonstrare a type I disk extrusion of the L7-S1 inter-
vertebral disk.
B.Anomalous/developmental
1.  Congenital vertebral malfortmatrions1.,19,30,4,48.50,62,3,63,70.30
For the most part, the congenital vertebral malformations discussed in Chapter 10 can occur in
the lumbosacral region. Clinical features, diagnostic and treatmcnt options, and prognosis are sinilar
to that described for other areas of the spinc. There are some vertcbral malformations that are
specific to the lumbosacral area.
a.Idiopathic lumbosacral stenosis: Idiopathic lumbosacral stenosis is an ill-defincd disordcr primar
ily in adult, small- to mcdium-sized dogs that is most likely due to abnormal embryologic
formation of the neural arch. This may be a forn of congenital stenotic vertebral canal (see
 Chapter 10). Bony abnormalities, which are probably present since birth, include abnormally
thick laminae and articular facets. Mild degenerative soft tisue changes over time (e.g. thickened
liganentum favum, facet joint capsule thickening) are thought to have profound compressive
effects on the cauda equina due to the narowed bony canal. The prognosis is generally favorable
with surgical decompression.
b. Sacrocaudal (sacrococcygeal) dysgenesis/agenesis: Sacrocaudal dysgenesis/agenesis is a spectrum of
congenital abnormalities involving both the bony and soft-tissue structures of the lumbosacral and
coccygeal spine that occurs most commonly in Manx cats, The trait is inherited in an autosomal
dominant fashion. There are varying degrees of abnormalities and thus varying degrees of neuro
logic dysfunction associated with this disorder. Bony abnormalities include spina bifida, as well as
agenesis or dysgcnesis of sacral and coccygeal vertebrae. Soff-tissue anomalics associated with thc
cauda equina include syringomyelia/hydromyelia, meningocele and myelomeningocele (Fig. 11.9),
anid agenesis of spinal cord segments and nerve roots in this region. Tethered cord syndromc
(discussed below) has also been reported with this disorder. Clinical deficits can vary from normal
neurologic function to inability to ambulate, with fecal and urinary incon.tinence. Clinical signs

can be static or progressive.Progressive signs are probably related to the instability caused by the
abnormal vertebral segments. Diagnosis is based upon signalment, history, and clinical findings, as
well as results of diagnostic imaging. There are no effective treatments available for most of the
 anomalies, and prognosis depends mainly on the extent of the neurologic deficits.
2.Developmental vertebral malformations
Stenotic vertebral canal and osteochondroma/osteochondromatosis can affect the cauda equina.
These disorders are discussed in Chapter 10.

 3. Congenital malformations of the cauda equina10.20,47,48,50,65,.7,84
Soft-tissue malformations associated with sacrocaudal dysgenesis/agenesis of cats are described
above. Congenital spinal cord malformations (discussed in Chapter 10) can affect the cord segments
of the cauda equina as well.However,there are some malformations of the cauda equina that are
more common to, or are exclusive to, this region of the spine.
a.Meningocele/myelomeningocele: A meningocele is a tubelike extension of the meninges (contain-
ing cerebrospinal fuid, or CSF) through a spina bifida defect of the vertebra that attaches to the
overlyingskin.Ameningomyeloceleisalesscommonvariantofameningocelethatcontains
cord segments. Occasionally, a meningocele will contain a large piece of skin-associated fat and is
termed a lipomeningocele. These abnormalities are most common in the sacrococcygeal area of the
spine. English Bulldogs and Manx cats appear to be predisposed to this disorder. Clinical signs of
dysfunction, when present, are primarily urinary and fecal incontinence. Clinical signs of hyper-
esthesia are usually absent.If tethered cord syndrome is not a large contributing factor to the
clinical dysfunction,there is no effective therapy for this condition.If the defect is open to the
environment, the development of life-threatening meningomyelitis is a concern.
b.Tethered cord syndrome: Tethered cord syndrome refers to a disorder in which caudal traction is
placedonthe cauda equina due to abnormal fixation of thefilium terminale(spinalcordmenin-
geal termination) during cmbryonic development.Traction causes neurologic dysfunction that
can sometimes be alleviated by surgical intervention. Tethered cord syndrome can occur primar-
ily as a defect of the filium terminale, or more commonly as a component of spina bifida and
meningocele/myelomeningocele.
4.Hydromyelia and syringomyelia
Hydromyelia and syringomyelia may affect the spinal cord contributions to the cauda equina.
Specifics of hydromyelia/syringomyelia are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10.
5.Dermoid sinus (pilonidal sinus)
Dermoid sinus may occur in the sacrocaudal region of the spine. This disorder is discussed in
more detail in Chapter 10.
C. Neoplastic9
Various primary and secondary bony and soft tissue neoplasms (discussed in Chapter 10) can affect the
lumbosacral region and the cauda equina (Fig. 11.10). Occasionally, retroperitoneal tumors will involve the

nerves of the lumbosacral plexus, causing either unilateral (e.g.,sciatic dysfunction) or bilateral evidence of
cauda equine dysfunction.
D. Infectious/inflammatory
a.Diskospondylitis refers to an infection of the intervertebral disk and its contiguous vertebrae,
fungal organisms (e.g., Aspergillus species). There is evidence to suggest that some dogs that
develop diskospondylitis may have defective immunocompetence as a predisposing factor.
Infectious organisms may gain access to the disk space and vertebrae via a number of proposed
mechanisms.
(1) Hematogenous spread: Hematogenous spread is believed to be the most common inecha-
nism, even though the primary source of infection is not always found. The urinary tract is
generally thought to be the most likely source of infection in most cases.
(2) Foreign body migration: The best example of foreign body migration is plant awn migration
The barbs of plant awns favor migration through tissue. These awns may carry bacteria with
them to the disk space and/or serve as a nidus for bacterial localization once they arrive at the
disk space.
(3) latrogenic: Infection may develop following spinal surgery or paravertebral injection.This is
considered to be the least likely mechanism for bacterial localization to the disk space and
vertebrae.
Diskospondylitis is most commonly encountered in medium- to giant-breed male
dogs of any age, but has been reported in small-breed dogs as well as in cats. In one large
retrospective study ofogswith diskospondylitisolderdogswere overrepresented,aswere
male dogs and purebred dogs (especially Great Danes). The odds of having diskospondylitis
in this study were highest for dogs more than 10 years of age. Any area of the spine may be
affected, but the thoracolumbar spine is more commonly affected than the cervical spine.
The L7-S1 disk space may be the most common site affected by diskospondylitis.A large
proportion of dogs in the study mentioned above (40.7%) had multiple diskospondylitis
lesions.
b. Most dogs with diskospondylitis display progressive clinical signs over at least several weeks, but
some dogs develop signs acutely. Clinical signs are often nonspecifc, but usually include hyperes-
thesia associated with the spinal lesion(s). Dogs with lumbosacral diskospondylitis tcnd to walk
with a stilted pelvic limb gait. Decreased appetite, weight loss, depression, fever, and reluctance
to move are other common nonspecific clinical features of this disease. Many dogs have no
neurologic deficits or mild evidence of neurologic dysfunction (e.g., proprioceptive deficits with
or without mild paresis). Some patients may be severcly paretic or plegic.
c.Diagnosis of diskospondylitis is usually based on characteristic radiographic findings of the
disease in a patient with supportive historical and clinical fearures. Radiographs usually reveal
collapse of the affected disk space(s), bony lysis in the end plate regions of the affected disk
space(s), and a variable component of bony proliferation and end plate sclerosis (Fig. 11.11).
These latter changes are often seen in chronic cases. A separate radiographic appearance, termed
vertebral physitis, has also bccn reported, primarily in young dogs (less than 2 years of age).The
majority of vertebral physitis cases have involved the lumbar vertebrae. In this condition, bony
lysis seems to originate in the caudal physeal region of the vertebral body, rather than the disk/
end plate region. Other clinical features of vertebral physitis appear to be indistinguishable from
diskospondylitis, however.
Radiographic changes may lag behind clinical signs by as much as 2-4 weeks. A patient with
normal radiographs and clinical features suggestive of diskospondylitis may still have that disease.

view).
Subtle lesions may also be missed if the radiographs are performed in the awake patient. In some
cases, bone scintigraphy, CT, or MR imaging of suspected lesions may be valuable.
Blood work results are often normal, although leukocytosis is occasionally evident on a
complete blood count. Urinalysis may reveal evidence of a urinary tract infection in some dogs.
Bacteria may be cultured from the blood, urine, and/or affected disk spaces (fuoroscopically
guided needle or surgical aspirate) of some patients. The reported success ratc of such culture
attempts is variable, but in general it is about 50%. There is some evidence that needle aspiration
of infected disk space(s) is more sensitive than urine or blood culture. Cerebrospinal fuid
examination and advanced imaging (preferably MR) should be considered in those patients with
severe neurologic deficits, especially in nonambulatory patients. The role of contrast radiography
in diskospondylitis is controversial. However, compressive lesions that are potentially surgically
correctable (e.g., concurrent disk extrusion/protrusion, inflamed or granulomatous epidural fat)
imaging may not be readily available. In one study, no adverse effects were associated with
myelography or epidurography in dogs with diskospondylitis. Compressive lesions were identified
in over half of the dogs in that study, and the vast majority (73%) were soft tissue (vs. bony)
lesions. However, the median degree of compression was small (5%) and often was not severe
enough to explain the degree of neurologic deficits. Otherfactors,such as interference to the
intrinsic spinal cord blood supply by inflammatory mediators and/or dynamic vertebral sublux-
ation, are likely involved in causing neurologic dysfunction in cases of diskospondylitis. Although
most bacterial diskospondylitis cases are due to staphylococcal infections,Brucella needs to be
ruled out (e.g, rapid slide agglutination test, card test, etc.) due to its zoonotic potential.
d.Ideally, medical treatment of diskospondylitis is guided by culture and antibiotic sensitivity
testing of the offending organism. Since the organism is usually a Staphylococcus species, frst-
generation cephalosporins or beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin drugs (e.g., oxacillin) are often
effective. In severely affected (e.g., paralyzed) patients, intravenous antibiotics should be adminis-
tered for thefrst 5-7 days, after which oral antibiotics can be instituted. Concurrent treatment
with antibiotics active against anaerobic bacteria should be considered, especially if there is
minimal to no response to therapy within the first week of treatment. Antibiotic therapy has
traditionally been recommended for at least several months. In the author's experience, dis-
kospondylitis patients usually require treatment well beyond several months. In one large retro-
spective study on canine diskospondylitis, the mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 53.7
weeks, suggesting that traditional recommendations regarding treatment duration may be too
conservative. Analgesic drugs (e.g., oral codeine) may also be necessary in some cases. The author
has had success using oral Tylenol with codeine in dogs with very painful diskospondylitis.

polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).
Dosing of this drug is based on the codeine (1-2 mg/kg, q 6-8 hr), not the acetaminophen.
Each Tylenol tablet contains 60 mg of codeine. Surgical intervention may be warranted in
patients with vertebral instability or with compressive lesions identified with CT, MR imaging.
or contrast radiography. Treatment of patients with Brucella infections typically entails a combi
nation of tetracyclines and aminoglycosides. Itraconazole is recommended for Aspergillus infec-
tions. Prognosis is generally favorable with bacterial diskospondylitis, particularly in cases with no
with severe neurologic deficits. In general, obvious clinical improvement is to be expected within
the first week of antibiotic therapy. Follow-up radiographs of affected disk spaces every 1-2
months are recommended to monitor the progress of disease. Fungal (e.g., Aspergillus sp.)
diskospondylitis is associated with a poor prognosis, as the infection is usually diseminated at
the time of diagnosis.
2. Meningitis/meningomyelitis
 Both granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) and the infectious diseases listed in
Chapter 10 can affect the cauda equina.
E.Ischemic/vascular
1.Fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy (FCE)
 FCE can affect the spinal cord segments contributing to the cauda equina. Specifics of this
disease are covered in Chapter 10.
This is a physiological phenomenon that has been proposed to explain exercise-associated pain
and lameness that is observed in some patients with cauda equina lesions. Radicular blood vessels
will dilate during exercise to meet metabolic demands. Since these vessels may pass through stenotic
intervertebral foramina, their dilation can lead to secondary compression and ischemia of the
F. Traumatic19:3.4.62.6374
Trauma to the spine is discussed in Chapter 12, and principles of medical and surgical therapy are similar
when considering the cauda equina and lumbosacral region. However, there are some aspects specific to the
cauda equina region to be considered. In contrast to the spinal cord segments, nerve roots of the cauda
equina may experience considerable stretching with displaced fractures of the lumbosacral area, yet they still
remain structurally and functionally intact. Surgical repair of caudal lumbar and lumbosacral fracture/
luxations (Fig. 11.12) is often challenging due to the sparse amount of bone available caudal to the injury
for placing implants (e.g., pins, screws).

Cats will occasionally present with fracture/luxations of the sacrococcygeal region due to suspected
traction injury. It is theorized that the tails of these cats are trapped by car tires as the cats are running to
avoid being hit.The resultant traction applied to the cauda equina may result in temporary or permanent
neurologic damage. These cars often display varying degrees of urinary and fecal incontinenice in addition to
intervention is of value for this condition. Many of these cats will make full recoveries, especially if anal
tone and perineal sensation are intact and appropriate bladder management is instituted soon after injury.
Failure to regain urinary continence within 1 month of trauma is a negative prognostic indicator.
Sacral fractures often accompany multiple pelvic fractures in dogs and cats. In general, the preservation
of pain sensation (nociception) in the areas of innervation of the cauda equina nerve roots is a favorable
prognostic indicator. Lateralized sacral fractures in dogs tend to have a better prognosis for neurologic
recovery than those located in a more central location.

SPINAL TRAUMA MANAGEMENT

Introduction
Injurics associatcd with spinal trauma include spinal cord contusion, vertebral fracture or luxation, and
traumatic intervertebral disk herniation (see Chapter 10). Common causes of spinal trauma in dogs and cats
include motor vehicle accidents, animal-animal or human-animal interactions, falls, and projectile injuries.
Patients with spinal trauma commonly have concurrent injuries to other major organ systems, necessitating
rapid and thorough assessment and survey for evidence of other life-threatening injuries.
injury and secondary injury Primary injury occurs as a direct result of the trauma, while secondary injury
includes several biochemical processes that are triggered by the primary injury and that perpetuate spinal
cord damage in the hours to days after the traumatic evennt.
A. Primary spinal cord injury
Spinal luxation, vertebral fracturc, traumaric intervertebral disk herniation, spinal cord contusion, and extra
axial hemorrhage are examples of primary spinal cord injuries that can occur secondary to trauma.
1. Vertebral fracture and spinal luxation: The stability of a spinal luxation or vertebral fracture is
compartment incorporates the articular processes, laminae, pedicles, and spinous processes. The
body, and the dorsal portion of the annulus fbrosus. The ventral compartmicnt contains the ventral
longitudinal ligaimenr, the lateral and ventral aspects of thc annulus fibrosus, thc nucleus pulposus,
and the remaining portions of the vertebral body. When any rwo of the three comparrments are
compromised, the injury is considered unstable. The type of fracture or luxation that occurs is
dependent upon the magnitude of force applied as wellas the nature of that force with respect to
the spinal column.Extension of the spinc commonly results in verrebral lamina, facet, or pedicle
fracures. These types of fractures often occur simultaneous with rupture of the annulus fibrosus.
Therefore, these types of fractures are commonly unstable wirh cxtcnsion of the spinc, but remain.
stable in fexion. Shearing or compressive forces most frequently resulr in vertebral body fractures,
and these types of fractures are generally unstable. Spinal cord compression can also result if fracture
fragmcnts are locared within the vertebral canal. Pure compression forces of sufficient magnitude
result in vcrccbral compression fractures. These fracrures are rarely unstable due to preservation of
the dorsal ligamcnts. Flexion of thc spine (with or without rotation) most coimmonly results in
spinal luxation, but often does so without vertebral fracture. Damage to both the dorsal and ventral
stabilizing ligamentous structures is the cause of the resultant instability. Rotation of the spinal
column with or without flexion is most often the cause of vertebral fracture withi concurrent spinal
luixation. Similar to luxation without fracture, the instability of this type of injury is due to compro-
mise of both dorsal and ventral ligamentous structures.

luxation.(Courtesy of Dr.Andy Shores,reprinted with permission)
 2. Traumatic intervertebral disk herniation: This type of primary injury typically ocurs in dogs with
underlying intervertebral disk disease, most commonly chondroid degeneration of the dorsal aspect
of the annulus fbrosus (Hansen's type I disk disease). This pathology predisposes the annulus to
rupture with trauma, resulting in compression of the spinal cord due to herniation of the nucleus
pulposus into the vertebral canal (see Chapter 10). This most frequently occurs in chondrodystro-
phic breeds, but can be present in any dog. Although it is much less common, cats can also develop
chondroid degeneration of the intervertebral disk, predisposing them to traumatic herniation.
3. Spinal cord contusion: Reports of hemorrhage into the spinal cord parenchyma are rare in the
veterinary literature; however, it is likely that contusions do occur secondary to vertebral fracture,
spinal luxation, or traumatic intervertebral disk herniation. Contusions are the result of damage to
blood vessels in the spinal cord parenchyma.In addition to resulting from direct trauma to the cord,
they may also develop secondary to traumaticmotion of the spinal cord within the vertebral canal,
resulting in coup and contrecoup lesions, similar to cerebral contusions that develop after head
trauma.
4.Extra-axial hemorrhage: Disruption of blood vessels serving the supportive structures surrounding
the spinal cord can result in accumulation of blood and hematoma formation. Subdural or epidural
accumulations can cause neurologic dysfunction by compressing the spinal cord and compromising
spinal cord blood fow. Although epidural and subdural spinal hematomas have been reported
secondary to trauma in humans, they are rare. Several veterinary case reports describe the develop-
ment of epidural hematomas secondary to spontaneous intervertebral disk herniation, but there are
no published reports of these types of injuries sccondary to trauma.
B.Secondary spinal cord injury
Many biochemical processes are set into motion by traumatic spinal cord injury and lead to continued
spinal cord injury over the first 24-48 hours after the primary injury. An understanding of these mecha-
nisms of secondary injuries is essential when devising a therapeutic plan for a patient with spinal cord
trauma.
1. Excitotoxicity: Excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and aspartate are present in increased
concentrations in the spinal cord parenchyma due to lcakage from damaged neurons as well as
decreased clearance by ischemic astrocytes. Stimulation of neighboring neurons by these neurotrans-
mitters leads to ATP depletion as well as influx of sodium and calcium. The result is cellular edema
and spinal cord swelling.Comprcssion of the swollen spinal cord contributes further to cellular
ischemia.
12/ SPINALTRAUMAMANAGEMENT
407
2. Loss of autoregulation: Spinal cord blood fow remains constant despite changcs in systemic blood
pressure due to intrinsic autoregulatory mechanisms, causing vasoconstriction in response to
increased blood prcssure and vasodilation in response to decreased blood pressure. These autoregula-
tory mechanisms arc commonly compromiscd afrer spinal cord trauma, and systermic hypotension,
common in patients with rauma, leads to decreased spinal cord blood flow. If hypotension persists,
spinal cord ischemia can result.
3. Accumulation of intracellular calcium: Excitotoxicity and activation of voltage-gated calcium chan-
ncls result in activation of phospholipase A2, triggering thc infammatory cascade. In addition,
adenosine triphosphate (Al'P) is depleted due to binding of calcium to phosphates, mirochondrial
dysfunction occurs, and cytotoxic edema develops. All of these processes triggered by incrcases in
intracellular calcium concentration lead to continued neuronal cell death.
4. Oxidative injury: Thc prcscnce of increascd intracellular calcium, ischemia-reperfusion phenomena,
all favor the production of rcactive oxygen species. Neuronal cell membranes, rich in polyunsaturated
fatty acids, provide an excellent medium for chain reactions that perpetuate this injury. This cycle of
oxidative damage contributes to ongoing cellular injury and necrosis.
5. Inflammation: Local spinal cord and systemic inflammation secondary to traumatic injury can be
severe. Inflainmatory mediators contribute to secondary injury by inducing nitric oxide (NO)
production via inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), providing a chemotactic stimulus for infux
of inflammatory cells and activating the arachidonic acid cascade. Several of these inffammatory
mediators are potent activators of coagulation, resulting in nicrovascular thrombosis and further
spinal cord ischcmia.
Although the neurologic signs present in patients with spinal trauma can be severe, the clinician must take a
global approach when initially evaluating the patient and must take care to identify all iniminently life-
threatening injuries. The basic “ABC” approach, quickly evaluating the pateney of the airway, the ability of
the patient to breathe,and the effectiveness of circulation, will afford identification of most life-thrcatening
injuries. Mosr paticnts with significant traumatic injurics will present in. a state of hypovolemic shock due to
inappropriate vasodilation, blood loss, or both. A minimum. database, including packed cell volume (PCV),
total solids (TS), azostix (AZO), and blood glucose (BG), are part of the inirial patient assessment. Hypovo-
lemia and hypoxemia can. conrribute to secondary spinal cord injury, and rapid correction of perfiusion
deficits is of paramount importance.
A.Fluid therapy
A paticnr with a systolic blood pressure less thian 90 mm Hg or a mean arterial blood pressure less than
80 mm Hg is hyporensive and ar risk for secondary spinal cord injury. Aggressive Huid resuscitation is
warranted in all hypovolcmic trauma parients. If the patient is anemic, whole blood or packed red blood cell
(pRBC) transfusion may assist in maintaining normovolemia as well as adequate tissue oxygenation by
improving blood oxygen content, thc major determinant of which is hemoglobin concentration. Fluid
support may include one or more of the following choices.
1.Synthetic colloids: 10-20 ml/kg over 15-20 minutes to effect (up to 40 ml/kg in the initial hour)
for hypovolemic shock. This can be given as a rapid bolus in dogs; give it in 5 ml/kg increments over
 5-10 minutes in cats. In the ezhydrated trauma patient, hetastarch is an excellent choice for restor-
ing normal blood pressure. Dextran-70 is an acceptable alternative. Dehydrated trauma victims
should receive isotonic crystalloid resuscitation.
2. Hypertonic saline (7%): 4-5 ml/kg over 15.-20 minutes for hypovolcmic shock. Hypertonic salinc is
also available as a 23.4% solution, which cannot be administered undilutcd, but may bc mixed 1:3
801
APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINE AND FELINENEUROLOGY
with herastarch or dextran-70 (e.g., 20 ml of 23.4% hypertonic saline plus 40 ml herastarch or
dextran-70 ini a 60-ml syringe) to produce a solution of synthetic colloid suspended in a 7% hypcr-
tonic saline solution. Hypertonic saline also has positive inotropic effects, immunomodulatory
effects, and reduces endothelial sweling.
3. Isotonic crystalloids (e.g., lactated Ringer's sofution, 0.9% salinc): 20-30 ml/kg bolus over 15--20
minurcs for hypovolemic shock. May bc repeated as necessary after rcassessment. Since overhydration
is a concern with crystalloid administration, the “shock dose” (90 ml/kg in the dog, 60 ml/kg in the
cat) of crystalloids should be given incrementally to effect as described abovc. If thc cntire volume is
not necessary to restore euvolemia and normal blood pressure, Huid administration should bc tapered
when these physiologic goals are met.
4. Blood products: Administration of 1 ml/kg of pRBCs or 2 ml/kg of whole blood will increase the
packed cell volume (PCV) by 1%. The severity of aneinia will dictate the total dose to be adminis-
tered, bur 10-15 ml/kg of pRBCs is a reasonable starting dose. Blood products are typically adminis-
tered over 4 hours, but they may be given faster (to effect) if the patient is unstable. Boluses of
blood products are acceptable in the severely anemic trauma patient. Goals of therapy with blood
products arc a PCV between 25% and 30%. Patienrs with demonstrated coagulopathy should also
be trcated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at a dose of 10--15 ml/kg two to three times per day until
the coagulopathy has rcsolved.
B.Pressors
In patients unresponsive to Huid therapy, vasopressor agents should be used to maintain adequate systemic
hlood prcssurc. Paticnts with inappropriate vasodilation, which is common in traumatized anirmals, may
benefit from dopamine (5-12 μg/kg/min) or norcpinephrine infusion (1-10 μg/kg/min). Pauients with
decreased cardiac contractility due to underlying heart disease or traumatic myocardial injury may respond
to dopamine or dobutamine (l-20 μg/kg/min) infusion.
C. Oxygenationi and ventilation
Hyperoxygenation is recommended for most trauma paticnts. Initial assessment is based upon rcspiratory
rate and cffort, mucous membrane and tongue color, and thoracic auscultation. Pneumothorax and pulmo-
nary contusions are common sequelae of trauma and must be promptly addressed. In the face of increased
respiratory rate and cffort, lung sounds may not consistently be decreased on auscultation in patients wich
pleural space disease (e.g pncumothorax or hemothorax). A rapid, shallow brcathing pattern, pale oral
mucous membranes, and evidcncc of respiratory distress are indications of pleural space disease, and thora-
cocentesis should be done in any trauma patient with these signs. Thoracocentesis should be considcred a
diagnostic test as well as a therapentic intervention. If negative pressure cannot be obtained via thoracocen-
resis, a chest tube should be placed immediately. If arterial blood gas analysis is available, thc partial prcssure
of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) should be maintained at or above 90 mm Hg for dogs and 100 mm Hg
for cats. Pulse oximeters are extremely useful and relatively accurate estimators of oxygenation status.
However, the reliability of pulse oximeters varies with the model used, with the PaO level (pulse
(ximeters may overestimate oxygenation status at lower PaO, Icvcls), and with the parient's henodynainic
statis.
Paticnts who are conscious and not obviously deteriorating neurologically should be administered
supplemental oxygcn via face mask, nasal cannulae, nasal oxygen catherer, or transtracheal oxygen catheter.
Face masks tend to stress dogs and cats and should only be used temporarily until another form of oxygen
(O) delivery can be institured (c.g-, nasal O2). The use of an O cage is generaly an ineffective rmethod of
administering supplemental O2 to patients with severe spinal injury as rnost require frequent or constant
monitoring. Oxygen cages do not allow for concomitant close patient observation (requires opening the cage
door) and maintenance of a high-oxygen environnent. With nasal and transtrachcal O, catheters, an
12/ SPINALTRAUMAMANAGEMENT

inspired oxygen concentration of 40% is provided with fow rates of 100 ml/kg/min and 50 ml/kg/min,
respectivcly. Oxygcn concentrations as high as 95% can be delivered with proportionally higher flow rates,
Nasal O2 catheters should not be placed farther than the level of the medial canthus.
Patienrs wich airway trauma causing obstruction or spinal cord disease causing hypoventilation shoud
be intubated and ventilated. If intubation is not possible due to airway obstruction, emergency tracheos-
tomy is indicated. Arterial blood gas measurement is the bcst way to monitor ventilation, which is refected
in PaCO, levels.End-ridal CO, measurenient is a uscful monitoring tool, but it rends to underestimate the
true PaCO, levels due to the likelihood of dead spacc ventilarion. Venous CO levels (PvCO) are also
hclpful and are usually less than 5 mm Hg greater than PaCO. However, in patients with perfusion deficits,
peripheral PvCO levels can be significantly higher than arterial values and should be interpreted cautiously.
Ventilatory rates of 10-15 breaths per rminure should be suficient to maintain PaCO levels between 35 and
The goal should be normocapnia (PaCO, of 35-45 mm Hg)
C. The initial neurologic examination
neurologic exam should be done to localize any spinal cord lesions and to determine if an unstable fracture
is present. Nonambulatory animals should be minimally manipulated on presentation until the presence of
an unstable injury has been ruled out. Initially, all patients shiould be treated as if an unstable injury is
present.
The initial neurologic exam should include evaluation of mentation; complete cranial nerve examina
tion; assessment of ambulation; and presence of voluntary motor function, segmental refexes, and superfi-
sensation in the affected limbs should be done. In patients with thoracolumbar trauma, the panniculus
reflex should also be tested and may provide further localizing inforination. In addition to the neurologic
exam, an orthopedic evaluation of affecred limbs should be done to determine if musculoskeletal injury
could be responsible, bur only to the degree that such an evaluation can be done safely in a patienr with a
potentially unstable spinal injury. The spine should be gently palpated to identify areas of crepitus, potential
malalignment, or pain. Extensor rigidity of the thoracic limbs in combination with paraplegia (Schiff-
Sherington posture) indicates severe thoracolumbar injury. Although this finding is useful in the context of
neurolocalization, it has not been shown to be a prognostic indicator. It may be present in animals with
spinal cord lesions of varying severity. Patients without evidencc of mentarion, cranial nerve, or orthopedic
abnormalities, but who arc unable to ambulate, should raise the clinician's index of suspicion for severe
spinal trauima. Significant spinal cord injury may bc present even if che animal was noted to ambulate
irnmediately after the injury. Brachial plexus injury is likely in patienrs with absence of withdrawal relex in
one thoracic limb, Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos) in the ipsilateral eyc and ipsilat-
cral loss of the panniculus reflex.
IV. Diagnostic Imaging Procedures5,720,3849.5
A. Spinal radiographs
Spinal radiographs are generally indicated in animals with suspected vertebral injury, but they must be done
cautiously to minimize the risk of further injuring the spinal cord. All trauma patients with evidence of
myelopathy should be treated as if they have unstable fractures until definitive evidence to the contrary is
available. Lateral radiographs of the spine can usually be obtained safely and may provide valuable diagnos-
tic information in animals with spinal injuries (Fig. 12.2). Sedation for spinal radiographs can lead to

the region of the injury.
increased instability of the spine due to relaxation of the paraspinal musculature, causing further spinal cord
trauma. Patient positioning can be crucial to obtaining spinal radiographs of good diagnostic quality;
rigid backboard can provide external coaptation sufficient to protect the spinal cord from significant addi-
tional trauma in the face of unstable spinal injuries. Lateral radiographs can be taken with the patient
immobilized in this way. Ventrodorsal radiographs can also be obtained in a laterally recumbent patient
immobilized with this technique by using a horizontal beam technique.
In canine patients with spinal trauma, plain radiography has low sensitivity for vertebral fractures (72%)
and subluxations (77.5%), as well as low negative predictive values for the presence of fracture fragments
within the vertebral canal (51%). Therefore, spinal radiographs alone should not be used to definitively rule
out the presence of these types of injuries. Traumatic intervertebral disk herniations are also difficult to
diagnose on spinal radiographs. Narrowing of an affected disk space has been shown to be the most useful
radiographic sign of intervertebral disk herniation. However, this finding has low sensitivity (64%-69%)
and positive predictive value (63%-71%) for diagnosis of herniation.
B.Advanced imaging
Due to the limitations of plain radiography, advanced imaging techniques such as myelography, computed
tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are often required to definitively localize and
evaluate the severity of spinal injury. These advanced imaging modalities require general anesthesia. Relax-
ation of the stabilizing paraspinal muscles results, and the risk of additional spinal cord injury is increased.
to the spinal cord due to unstable spinal injuries.
1. Myelography: Contrast (iohexol, 0.25-0.45 ml/kg) is injected into the subarachnoid space via a
spinal needle placed at the L4-L5 or L5-L6 junction.Radiographs are taken after contrast injection,

showing a column of contrast on either side of the spinal cord within the vertebral canal. Compres-
sive lesions of the spinal cord can be identified as defects in the contrast columns. Using this tech-
nique, extradural lesions such as traumatic intervertebral disk herniation or extra-axial hematomas, as
well as intraparenchymal swelling or hemorrhage, can be readily diagnosed (Fig. 12.3). However,
positioning of patients for contrast injection during myelography can cause an increased risk of
spinal cord trauma if unstable spinal injuries are present. In addition, although compressive lesions
are readily diagnosed with myelography, little additional information about spinal cord injuries such
as edema or vertebral fractures is obtained.
2. Magnetic resonance imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging uses a combination of a strong magnetic
field and intermittent radio frequency pulses to obtain high-resolution images of soft tissue structures
(Fig. 12.4). Because the device relies on a very strong, static magnetic feld and detection of small
changes in that feld, the equipment and facilities necessary are extremely expensive, and availability
for veterinary practitioners is somewhat limited.MR imaging is superior for evaluation of spinal
cord hemorrhage and edema, as well as for damage to supporting soft tissue structures such as the
epaxial musculature and ligaments. It is also an excellent modality for diagnosis of traumatic inter-
vertebral disk herniation or extra-axial hemorrhage. However, the technique provides poor detail of
bony structures, and several studies in human medicine have shown that significant spinal fractures
can be overlooked on MR images.
412
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
3.Computed tomography: Computed tomography scanners utilize a rotating pair of X-ray tubes and
detectors to obtain high-resolution images of soft tissue and bony structures.The resulting images
consist of a set of slices of a prescribed thickness (usually several millimeters thick) of the area of
inrerest (Fig. 12.5). Computer aligorithms can be used to create three-dimensional representations of
various structures, including the spinal cord, supporing structures such as ligaments, and the
vertebrae. This technique has been shown to be an extremely sensitive diagnostic test for acute
bony lesions in human polytrauma, with sensitivity of up to 100% in several studies. With
injection of intravenous contrast agents, the presence of spinal cord edema and hemorrhage can be
diagnosed due to compromise of the blood-spinal cord barrier. This combination of characteristics
makes it the preferred imaging modality for human patients with polytrauma including the spinal
column,

Specifc Therapy or Spinal Trauma716,18,20,21,2326,29,32,36,40-46,8,49,54-57,59.60
A.Primary injury
Treatment of primary traumatic spinal injury may include surgical and/or medical intervention.The severity
and nature of the underlying primary injury will dictate the most appropriate treatment, and the protocol
must be tailored to the individual patient.
1. Vertebral fractures and spinal luxations: These types of injuries may be treated nonsurgically or with
sugical decompression, reduction, and/or fixation. There is considerable debate in the veterinary
literature regarding indications for surgical versus nonsurgical management of vertebral fractures and
spinal luxations. The personal opinion of the surgeon and the choice of the owner ultimately
determine which patients arc surgical candidates. Howevcr, several general indications are widely
agreed upon to be indications for surgical management: (1) minimal voluntary motor function or
complete paralysis, (2) clinical or radiographic evidence of highly unstable fractures, (3) progression
of neurologic signs despite appropriate nonsurgical management. There are various surgical options
for stabilization and internal fixation, including the use of bone plates, screws, Steinmann pins, and
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement. These procedures require advanced training, and referal
to a board-certified surgeon or neurosurgeon should be recormmended. Surgical management results
in immediate stabilization of the spine and more rapid return to function. However, thesc proce-
dures are expensive, and complications such as worsening of spinal cord injury due to instability of
the extraspinal muscles during anesthesia and surgical manipulation, implant failure, and infection
are possible.
of nonsurgical therapy for these types of injuries. Many materials are available for splint construc
tion, including berglass, thermoplastics, plaster, metal rods,or other materials that can be fashioned
to conform to the patient's body shape. The splint will not successfully aid healing unless the entire
spine is immobilized. When bandaging the splint in place, it is imperative that the patient's ventila-
tion not be compromised. Daily bandage checks are cssential to ensure that no soiling or other
does nor require specialized equipment, and allows owners to provide care at home. However,
nursing care is of paramount importance and can be quite labor intensive. In addition, patients
neurologic deficits.
2. Traumatic intervertebral disk herniation: Both surgical and nonsurgical treatment are reasonable for
traumatic intervertebral disk herniation as well. Patients with loss of voluntary motor function or
rapidly progressing neurologic deficits should be considered for surgical management. Depending
upon the site and severity of the herniation, dorsal laminectomy, hemilaminectomy, or a ventral slot
procedure may be indicated. Stable patients with intact voluntary motor function are candidates for
12/ SPINALTRAUMAMANAGEMENT

medical managemcnt consisting of strict cage rest for 6-8 weeks to allow resolution of spinal cord
inflammation. Anti-infammatory medications, such as steroids at anti-infammatory doses (e.g,
0.5 mg/kg prednisone PO, q 12 hr, tapered over 1 week) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medica-
tions (e.g., carprofen, deracoxib) can be used initially for pain relicf, but it should be stressed that
thcsc medications do not have any significant protective cffcct on the spinal cord. The subjcct of
intcrvcrtcbral disk extrusions is covered in detail in Chapter 10.
3. Spinal cord contusion: Contusion rarely occurs as a sole entity and is usually rhe result of a compres-
sive lesion or spinal instability. Treatinent involvcs addressing the concurrent primary injury via
surgical or nonsurgical management and medical therapy to reduce secondary injury.
4. Extra-axial hematoma: Aggressive surgical evacuation to relieve spinal cord compression is recom-
mended in people with traumatic cxtra-axial hemorrhage. Because of more limited access to
advanced imaging modalities, these trypes of injuries are rarely diagnosed in veterinary
medicine secondary to trauma. If diagnosed, surgical decompression is recommended in these
Cases.
B.Secondary injury
Secondary injury, as described above, develops irmrnediately after the traumatic cvent and continues in the
hours to days after the injury. It is responsible for much of the progression of neurologic dysfunction noted
after a traumatic event. Many therapies to ameliorate secondary injury have been proposed in the clinical
and experimental literaturc.
1. Maintenance of perfusion: As discusscd previously, mainraining systemic blood pressure and blood
ondary spinal cord injury. Spinal cord
blood How autoregulatory mechanisms are commonly compromised by trauma, and patients sustain-
ing spinal trauma frequently have respiratory, cardiovascular, or head trauma as well as significant
hemorrhage, all of which can lead to decreased systemic blood pressurc and oxygen delivery. In the

tal and clinical literature of both beneft and harm from the use of these drugs in patients with
spinal cord injury. A thorough understanding of the evidence for both benefit and harm is essential
for the clinician considering administration of these drugs. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate
for secondary spinal cord injury. Proposed neuroprotective mechanisms include improvement of
spinal cord blood ow, antioxidant (i.e., free radical scavenging) effects, and anti-inflammatory
activity. Free radical scavenging has been shown experimentally ro be the most inportant protective
effect in patients with spinal cord injuny. Other cominon corticosteroids (e.g, dexamethasone,
prednisone) have minimal anti-oxidant effects and are unlikely to have any significant neuroprotec-
tive effect, although they may reduce the discomfort associated with the injury. A scries of threc
human clinical trials (the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study, or NASCIS) provide the primary
evidence of a beneficial effect of MPSS in patienrs with spinal cord injury. The only placebo-
controlled trial (NASCIS 2) showed a mild improvement in motor scores at 6 weeks for patients
treated with MPSS (30 mg/lkg bolus, followcd by a constant rate infusion of 5.4 mg/kg/hr for 48
hours) cornpared to the placcho group, but this effect was not present at 6 months or 1 year after
injury. Only inl a post hoc, subgroup analysis were the authors ahle to show an improvemcnt in
motor scores at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year in the group of paticnts trcated with MPSS for 48
hours beginning 3-8 hours after injury. No difference in outcome between the treatment groups was
414
A PRACTICAL GUIDETO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
noted at any of the time points for patients treated less than 3 hours or greater than 8 hours after
injury. Thcrc were no differences in mortality hetwecn the groups, but there was an increased
incidence of scverc pneumonia and a trend for an increased risk of sepsis in the groups treated with
MPSS for 48 hours at thc 6-weck time point.
There has been much dcbate in the human literature over the rcsults of the NASCIS 2 trial.
Although the use of high-dose MPSS for patients with spinal cord injury continues to be considered
the standard of care, several surveys have shown a lack of confidence in this therapy arnong human
neurosurgeons. No placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of MPSS in veterinary patients
with spinal cord injury have been done. Studics havc shown significant side effecrs of corticosteroid
treatment in spinal cord-injured dogs, including gastrointestinal ulceration as well as prolonged
hospital stays. Given thc prevalcnce of complications, the lack of clinical trials demonstrating efficacy
in veterinary species, and the likelibood that the mild functional improvements noted in the
NASCIS 2 trial would not correlate to significant inprovenents in quality of life in veterinary
species, it is the authors opinion that the risks of high-dose steroid therapy outweigh the potential
benefits.
3. Polyethylene glycol (PEG);: Polyethylene glycol is a hydrophilic polymer that exerts a ncuroprotectivc
effect on nerve fibers by sealing damaged membranres, allowing the fibers to more rapidly restorc
normal sensory and motor conduclion. PEG also reduces the effects of excitotoxicity by sealing
defects in ncuronal cell membranes, reducing leakage of excitatory neurotransmitters. ogs treated
with PEG (2 ml/kg of a 30% solution) within 72 hours of acute, spontaneous intervertebral disk
rrauma had improved outcomes compared to historical controls. Although these data are preliminary
and this drug has not becn evaluatcd in patients with other types of spinal trauma, PEG may
provide a promising new thcrapy for acute spinal trauma.
V1. Prognosis and Complications 46.20.27,337/52
Neurologic recovery after spinal trauma is difficult to predict and lilkely is affected by the type and severity
 of primary injury as well as the effecriveness and timcliness of treatmcnt of secondary injury. Presence of
Because it is transmitted by smal-diameter tracts locaed within the deepest areas of white matter mmedi-
ately adjacent to spinal cord gray matter, lossof deep pain perception is evidencc of functional spinal cord
transcction. However, some patients with loss of deep pain perception can recover neurologic function with
trcatment.
Spinal luxarion and vertebral fracture carry a poorcr prognosis than traumatic disk herniation.In onc
study, 2 of 17 (12%) dogs with vertebral fracrurcs or spinal luxation and absence of deep pain sensation
regained the ability to walk, while 69% of dogs with intervertebral disk herniation and loss of deep pain
 perception did so. In dogs with cervical vertebral fractures, nonambulatory starus and delay of more than 5
days to referral for surgical stabilization have been independently associated with a worse outcome. Cervical
vertebral fracture stabilization is associated with a high perioperative mortality (36%), but dogs that survive
this period have a good prognosis for neurologic recovery. Cervical injuries also carry the risk of short-term,
postoperative hypoventilation, potentially necesstating mechanical ventilation. Although costly, one retro
spective stucdy of dogs with cervical spinal cord injury showed that 10 of 14 dogs treated with mechanical
with spinal injury is likely similar to dogs, although the litrerarurc is sparse. One retrospective study demon-
strated a high incidencc of myelomalacia at surgery and/or necropsy in cats with loss of deep pain percep
Prognosis is also dependent upon the extent of other, concurrent injurics. Spinal trauma rarely occurs in a
vacuum, and traurma to other organ systems is common. The cumulative effects of each individual injury on
progriosis must be considered.

ABNORMALURINATION
Curtis W. Dewey
Introduction17,23
Disorders of urination are commonly encountered in patients with neurologic disease. If not properly
managed, they can become more of a health concern than the underlying neurologic disorder. Serious
urinary tract problems (e.g., atonic bladder, pyelonephritis) that are secondary to neurologic disease arc
usually preventable. The key to prevention is a combination of having a sound knowledge base and being a
careful examiner. It should never be assumcd that a paralyzed dog or cat is urinating adequatcly because
observe for voluntary urination). It is essential that the clinician understand how to deal with what is
commonly referred to as the“neurologic bladder.” The techniques of bladder expression and urethral
catheterization are discussed in Chapter 17.This chapter focuses on the functional neuroanatomy and
neuropharmacology of urination. The basic principles outlined in this chapter are necessary for the clinician
to understand what type of bladder dysfunction is present (e.g., upper motor neuron [UMN] or lower
motor neuron [LMN] bladder) and what drugs are likely to help in managing the dysfunction.
II.
A. The urinary bladder
1. The urinary bladder is a hollow organ primarily composed of threc layers of smooth muscle, collec-
tively termed the detrusor muscle.There are also mucosal,submucosal, and serosal layers.The
detrusor muscle contains both adrenergic and cholinergic (muscarinic) receptors that are important
in bladder flling and contraction, respectively. The important receptors for efferent autonomic
innervation of the body of the bladder are summarized below.
a.Beta adrenergic receptors: These sympathetic receptors are innervated by the hypogastric nerve,
which in turn originates from the L1-L4 spinal cord segiments in the dog (L2-L5 segments in the
cat). Stimulation of these receptors causes detrusor muscle relaxation, which allows bladder filling.
b. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors: These parasympathetic receptors are innervated by the pelvic
nerve, which originates from the sacral (S1-S3) spinal cord segments. Stimulation of these
receptors causes detrusor muscle contraction, which leads to bladder emptying.
2.There are also sensory receptors (stretch and pain) in the wall of the bladder. Stretch receptors are
innervated by afferent axons that travel through thepelvicnerve toward the sacral spinal cord
segments. Pain receptors are innervated by afferent axons that travel in both the pelvic and
hypogastric nerves, but primarily in the hypogastric nerves.
B.The urethra
1. For practical purposes, the neck of the bladder can be thought of as the proximal aspect of the
urethra. The smooth muscle of the urethra is primarily innervated by the hypogastric nerve and is
often considered to represent an internal sphincter, although it is not a true sphincter. The external
urethral sphincter is composed of striated muscle that encircles the distal urethra.The external
urethral sphincter is innervated by the pudendal nerve. This is a somatic motor nerve whose cell
bodies are in the sacral spinal cord segments (primarily S1 and S2). The imporant receptors for
efferent urethral innervation are as follows.

Rudowsky)
a.Alpha adrenergic receptors: These sympathetic receptors are innervated by the hypogastric nerve.
Stimulation of these receptors causes contraction of smooth muscle in the neck of the bladder
and urethra. This muscle contraction opposes urine fow through the urethra and therefore
facilitates bladder filling.
b. Nicotinic cholinergic receptors: These somatic motor receptors are located on the external
urethral sphincter and are innervated by the pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve is under
voluntary control, but the neuronal cell bodies of this nerve within the sacral spinal cord also
receive involuntary afferent input. Stimulation of these receptors causes sphincter contraction,
which opposes urine fow through the urethra, thus facilitating bladder flling.
2. Similar to the bladder, there are sensory receptors in the wall of the urethra for conveying informa-
tion concerning distention (stretch), pain, and urine fow. These receptors are innervated by afferent
axons that travel in thepudendal nerve toward the sacral spinal cord segments.
III. Local Reflex Arcs78,10,12,14,17,21-25.,28,31
A. Somewhat analogous to innervation of the limbs, there are inherent spinal refex arcs involved in bladder
filling and emptying. Although there is some level of spinal reflex control of urination in adult dogs and
cats, these reflex arcs cease to function autonomously after infancy (34 weeks in puppies, 7-12 weeks
in kittens). Thereafter, these reflex centers require descending influences from the brain stem for
coordinated urination to occur. The refex arcs depend on a number of anatomic structures.
1.The pelvic plexus: This refers to the meshwork of autonomic nerves and ganglia located in the pelvic
canal. Within this plexus are afferent and efferent processes of the pelvic and hypogastric nerves.
2. The pudendal nerve: Technically part of the lumbosacral plexus, this nerve is also located in the
pelvic canal.
3.The sacral spinal cord: Neuronal cell bodies for the pelvic nerve are located in the intermediolateral
 gray matter, and neuronal cell bodies for the pudendal nerve are located in the ventral horn gray
matter.
4. The lumbar spinal cord: Neuronal cell bodies for the hypogastric nerve are located in the interme-
diolateral gray matter from L1-L4 spinal cord segments in the dog and L2-L5 segments in the cat.

B.As the bladder flls, stretch receptors are stimulated, and this afferent information is carried via the pelvic
nerve to the parasympathetic nuclei in the sacral spinal cord. Efferent impulses from these nuclei
through the pelvic nerve initiate derrusor contraction. As the detrusor muscle contracts, another volly
of afferent impulses enters the sacral spinal cord. Some of these afferent axons inhibit the sacral neuronal
cell bodies of the pudendal nerve, whereas some ascend to the lumbar spinal cord to inhibit the
sympathetic cell bodies of the hypogastric nerve. The net result is bladder contraction with ncarly
simultaneous urethral relaxation and coordinated urination.
A.Thebrainstemmicturition center
and emptying. These neurons are principally located in the reticular formation of the pons and to a lesser
degree in the midbrain and medulla. Two distinct regions of the pons have been demonstrated to be
involvcd in the filling and evacuation phases of the detrusor reflex,respectively. The dorsolateral rcgion of
the pons contains two groups of neurons involved in the micturition reflex: a medial cell group (M region)
and a lareral cell group (L region). Neurons of the M region (Barrington's nucleus) project excitatory axons
to the parasympathetic (muscarinic cholinergic) motor neurons in the sacral spinal cord that give rise to the
pelvic nerves. Axonal processes from M region neurons also innervate inhibitory interneurons (GABA-ergic)
that synapse on nicotinic cholinergic motor neurons in the sacral spinal cord that give rise to the pudendal
nerves. Activation of neurons of the M region facilitates urinary bladder evacuation.
Axons projecting from the L region neurons have excitatory synaptic connections with nicotinic cholin-
ergic sacral motor neurons that give rise to the pudendal nerves. Activation of L region neurons facilitates
urinary bladder filling. The brain stem micturition center can be considered the upper motor neuron for
normal urination.
422
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
B.The detrusor reflex
Some of the afferent impulses (from stretch receptors) from the bladder and urethra are conveyed rostrally
up the spinal cord (via spinothalamic pathways) to the brain stem micturition center rather than terminat-
ing on spinal cord neuronal pools. Neurons of the brain stem micturition center subsequently convey
descending efferent information through the spinal cord (reticulospinal tracts, tectospinal tracts) to the
various spinal cord neuronal pools involved in urination. The coordinated act of urination that results from
completing this brain stem/spinal cord reflex arc is referred to as the detrusor reflex. It should be kept in
mind that this is a brain stem reflex that does not rcquire conscious input (cerebral cortical influence) to
operate.
V.Forebrain and Cerebellar Infuence on the Detrusor Reex45,8.10.12.13,15.17.18.22-25.30
A.Forebrain influence
Afferent impulses from the bladder reach the cerebral cortex via the pelvic (cat) and hypogastric (dog and
cat) nerves and ascending spinal cord tracts. The sensations of strech and pain are conveyed to the cerebral
cortex via these afferent pathways. The detrusor refiex can be consciously inhibited via the cerebral cortex;
this is the basis of house-training. The detrusor reflex can also be voluntarily initiated (e.g., territorial
marking behavior). Patients with cerebral cortical dysfunction typically urinate normally, but will do so in
inappropriate locations (loss of learned urination habits). The basal nuclei and preoptic area of the hypo-
thalamus may play a role in the initiation of bladder evacuation. The ventromedial region of the hypothala-
mus has an inhibitory infuence on urination.
B. Cerebcllar infuence
The infuence of the ccrcbellum on urination appears to be minor. The cerebellum normally exerts an
inhibitory infuence over the detrusor reflex. Cerebellar lesions may result in increased frequency of
urination.
VI.Normal Bladder Filling and Evacuation4,578,10,12-1417,192-2,22.31
A. Bladder filling (primarily controlled by L region of the pons)
1.As the bladder gradually fills with urine, afferent information is conveyed to neurons in the brain
stem micturition center. As the bladder is not stretched appreciably during this phase, the signal to
brain stem neurons involved in the micturition refex promotes further bladder filling. Brain stem
neurons involved in facilitating urine storage have the following efferent infuences on spinal cord
neuronal pools:
a.Facilitation of the somatic efferent neuronal cell bodies composing the pudendal nerve.
b.Facilitation of the adrenergic efferent neuronal cell bodies composing the hypogastric
nerve.
C. Inhibition of the cholinergic efferent neuronal cell bodies composing the pelvic nerve.
2. The brain stem micturition center neurons involved in urine storage will remain active until bladder
capacity is rcached. Until then, the net effects of the above influences are bladder relaxation and
urethralconstriction.
B. Bladder evacuation (primarily controlled by M region of the pons)
1.When bladder capacity is reached, the resultant stretching of the detrusor muscle produces an
afferent “threshold” stimulus. The threshold phenomenon can be compared to an “on/off"” switch;
micturition center changes to promote bladder emptying. Neurons involved in urinary bladder
evacuation have the following efferent infuences on the spinal cord neuronal pools involved in
urination:

a. Inhibition of the somaric effercnr ncuronal cell bodies composing the pudendal nerve.
b. Inhibition of che adrenergic effcrent neuronal cll bodies composing the hypogastric nerve.
C. Facilitation of the cholinergic efferent neuronal cell bodies composing the pelvic nerve.
2.The net effecrs of the above infuences are bladder contraction and urethral relaxation, resulting in
coordinated evacuation of the bladder.
VII.Upper Motor Neuron and Lower Motor Neuron Bladder Dysfunction36,10.16.7,34.26.2.29
A.Upper motor neuron bladder dysfunction
1.This type of bladder dysfunction is cncountered with lesions berween the pons and the L7 segment
of the spinal cord. Such lesions interfere with or abolish the detrusor refex. Patients are either
completely unable to urinate or cannot effectively accomplish bladder emptying. This is encountered
most commonly in patients with severe T3-L3 myelopathies.
2.1he hallmark of UMN bladder dysfumction is increased tone. This phenornenon tnay be thought of
as a disinhibition of the spinal cord neuronal pools involved in urination. The urethral musculature
typically becomes hyperactive and the bladder fills with urine. Upon palpation, the bladder often
fecis turgid (especially when enlarged) and is difficult or impossible to cxpress manually.
B. Lower motor neuron bladder dysfunction
1. This type of bladder dysfunction occurs with lesions of the sacral spinal cord or sacral nerves within
the vertebral canal (cauda equina area), or with lesions of the pelvic/lumbosacral plexus area within
thc pelvic canal. These lesions also attenuate or abolish the detrusor reflex. This type of bladder
dysfunction is seen most commonly withi trauumatic injurics to the caudal lumbar and sacral
spine.
2. The hallmark of LMN bladder dysfunction is decreased tone. Both the detrusor and urethral
musculature typically become flaccid, and the patient constantly dribbles urine. The bladder is often
dificult to discern as an isolated structure (due to the flaccidity), in contrast with the UMN bladder.
Slight abdominal pressure usually causes urine to be easily expressed. Ir is very difficult to tell by
palpation, however, if the bladder has been adequately emptied. In some patients, the unattenuated
efferent hypogastric nerve activity provides enough internal urethral sphincter tone to make bladder
cxprcssion difficnlt.
3. Paticnts with lesions causing LMN blaclder dysfunction often exhibit decrcascd or absent perineal
reflexes and sensation.
VII. Pharmacologic Manipulation of Bladdcr Function23.1.,1.1720.2324.28
A. Although there exists a multitude of pharmacologic agents that can be employed to manipulate bladder
and urethral function, only a few of these drugs are commonly used. The following discussion will focus
on those drugs most frequently used in clinical practice.
1. Bethanechol chloride
a. Bethanechol chloride is a parasympathomimetic (cholinergic drug) used to facilitate detrusor
muscle contraction in both UMN and LMN bladder dysfunction. Bcthanechol directly stimu-
lates cholincrgic receptors.
b. The dosage is cmpiric. The oral dosc for dogs is 2.5-25 mg (depending on the size of the dog)
per dog, every 8 hours. For cats, the dosage is 1.5--5 mg per cat, every 8 hours.
The half-life of elimination is unknown for dogs and cats. However, most patients seem to have
C.
d. Side effects may occur with this drug and reffecr cholinergic overstimulation. Most commonly,
gastrointesrinal sice effects are exhibited. Thesc include anorexia, salivation, vomiting, diarrhea,
and abdominal pain. Excessive lacrimation is also a possibility. A cholinergic crisis (e.g, increased
424
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
bronchial secretions,hypotension) can occur, but is very unlikely with standard doses of this
-Snp
c.Because bethanechol does not cause urethral relaxation, and may even enhance urethral sphincter
tone, it is recommended that it not be administered as a sole urinary drug to a patient with the
typical UMN bladder (i.e., increased urethral sphincter tone). Bethanechol is contraindicated in
patients with suspected or confirmed gastrointestinal or urinary tract obstruction.
2. Diazepam
a.This drug was discussed previously in Chapter 7 as an anticonvulsant agent. Diazepam also has a
relaxing effect on striated muscle and is therefore used to relax the external urethral sphincter in
patients with UMN bladder dysfunction. Diazepam may also promote relaxation of the external
urethral sphincter by stimulating GABA-ergic inhibitory interneurons in the sacral spinal cord.
b. The dosage for both dogs and cats is 0.2 mg/kg orally, every 8 hours.
C. Side effects are usually limited to excessive sedation. It should be kept in mind that cats have
been reported to develop fatal hepatic necrosis in association with oral diazepam administration.
This idiosyncratic reaction to diazepam in cats is probably not common, but clients should be
informed of its existence.
3.Phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride
a.1
Phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that is used to dccrease tone
in the internal urethral sphincter. It is used most commonly in UMN bladder dysfunction, but it
may also beindicated in some cases of LMN bladder dysfiunction (i.e.,increascd sympathetic
tone from the hypogastric nerve can cause a clinical problem even with decreased external
urethral sphincter tone). Phenoxybenzamine has been shown to have carcinogenic potential and
may be discontinued in the near future. An alternative alpha-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin (see
miscellaneous drugs below), can be used if phenoxybenizamine is not available.
b.The dosage for dogs and cats is 0.25-0.5 mg/kg orally, every 12 hours.
c.
The most common side effct is hypotension, due to inhibition of vascular adrenergic receptors.
Patients who have been given too much phenoxybenzamine generally appear lethargic and may
be tachycardic. They typically respond to drug discontinuation and fuid therapy. Gastrointestinal
upset may also occur with phenoxybenzamine administration.
d.The half-life of elimination of phenoxybenzamine is unknown in dogs and cats. Sinice it often
takes several days for clinical effects of this drug to be appreciated, the half-life is thought to be
relatively long.
4. Phenyipropanolamine hydrochloride
a.Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride is a mixed adrenergic agonist that increases the tonc of the
internal urethral sphincter. Since the goal in most of the neurologic causes of bladder dysfunction
is to keep the bladder empty, this drug is not commonly used in neurologic patients. It is most
commonly used in cases of hormone-related incontinence.However, it may be useful in some
than urethral continence.
b.The dosage for dogs and cats is 1.5 mg/kg orally, every 8-12 hours.
C.The elimination half-life of this drug is unknown for dogs and cats, but it appears to have a
relatively quick onset of action.
d. Potential side effects of this drug include hypertension, anorexia, and restlessness/irritability.
5. Miscellaneous drugs
Drugs that may be helpful in improving bladder contractility include metoclopramide, cisapride,
and propranolol. These drugs should be considered when bethanechol is ineffective. Metoclopramide
adrenergic antagonist. The oral dose of metoclopramide for dogs and cats is 0.2-0.5 mg/kg body
weight,every8hours.Possble sid ffects ofmetoclopramide includebehavioral abnormalitie and
constipation. Oral cisapride is administered at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg body weight, every 8 hours, in
13/ NEUROLOGYANDNEUROPHARMACOLOGYOF NORMALANDABNORMALURINATION
425
dogs. The recommended oral dose of cisapride in cars is 1.25-5.0 mg per cat, every 8-12 hours.
Adverse side effects that may occur with cisapride administration include diarrhea and abdoiminal
pain. Propranolol is dosed orally at 0.2-1.0 mg/kg body weighit, every 8 hours, in dogs; the oral dose
for cats is 2.5-5.0 mg per cat, every 8-12 hours. Hypotension, syncope, bronchoconstriction,
bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and diarrhea are all potential side effects of propranolol administration.
Several drugs may be helpful in efecting urethral relaxation in addition to phenoxybenzamine
and diazepam. Prazosin, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, was mentioned earlier. The oral dose of
prazosin for dogs is 0.067 mg/kg body weight, evcry 8-12 hours. The oral dose for cats is 0.25 mg
per cat, every 12-24 hours. Prazosin can produte marked hypotension. It is recommended that one-
half the calculated dose be administered for the first several days of treatment, and the patient
observed for clinical signs of hypotension. Baclofen is a spinal reflex-inhibiting drug that acts by
decreasing activity of spinal cord motor neurons and interneurons. The drug has been used in people
to cause relaxation of the external urethral sphincter. There is little clinical information concerning
the use of baclofen in dogs, and none in cats. The recommended dose for baclofen in dogs is 5
10 mg/kg body weight, every 8 hours. Potential side effects of baclofen include wcakness, dizziness,
and pryalism. Baclofen use is not recommended in cats. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that antago-
nizes calcium rcleasc from skeletal musclc sarcoplasmic reticulum; it has been used to produce
relaxation of the external urethral sphincter musculature. The oral dose of dantrolene in dogs is
1-5 mg/kg body weight, every 8 hours. The oral dose in cats is 0.5-2.0 mg/kg body weight, every
8 hours. Potential side effects of dantrolene administration include sedation, gastrointestinal upset,
dizziness, generalized muscle weakness, hypotension, and hepatotoxicity. Long-term dantrolene
adrminisrration is not recommended, due primarily to the chance of severe hepatotoxicity.

Introduction241,304
The peripheral nerves are made up of myelinated and unmyelinated motor and sensory axons and are
essential for normal functioning of both the voluntary and autonomic nervous systems. Some ncuropathies
are exclusively or primarily characterized by motor dysfunction, others by sensory dysfunction, and some by
a combination of motor and sensory dysfunction.Some of the salient features of autonomic neuropathies in
dogs and cats have only recently been described. Technically speaking, a mononeuropathy refers to dysfunc-
tion of one cranial nerve (e.g., facial nerve) or one named peripheral nerve (e.g., radial nerve). A polyneu-
ropathy refers to multiple (i.e., more than one) nerve dysfunction. In this text, multiple cranial nerve
dysfunction (without dysfunction of peripheral nerves to the limbs) and multiple peripheral nerve dysfunc-
tion in thc same limb (e.g, brachial plexus neuropathy/neuritis) will be referred to as multiple mononeuropa-
thies. This distinguishes these relatively focal disorders from more generalized polyneuropathies (e.g
idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis).
In general, neuropathies refect a failure of the lower motor neuron (LMN). Although somc of the
diseases discussed in this chapter have abnormal axons and/or myelin in both the central (CNS) and
peripheral (PNS) nervous systems, clinical signs of peripheral disease usually predominate. In those neuropa-
thies in which motor nerves are affected, typical clinical signs include decreased to absent reflex activity,
poor muscle tone, and neurogenic muscle atrophy. A recurring theme with canine and feline neuropathies is
that tentative diagnoses are oftenbased upon a combination of clinical features thatarecharacteristicfor
specific diseases.Electrodiagnostic and nerve/musclebiopsy evidencemay confirm thepresence of a neu-
ropathy, but rarely provides a specific diagnosis by itself. Even when a specific disease entity is confirmed
histopathologically (e.g., dysautonomia), the underlying etiology often remains undetermined. Indeed, the
underlying cause(s) of the majority of canine and feline neuropathies is (are) unknown. For many of these
disorders, therefore, there are no effective trcatments. However, some of these disorders resolve spontane-
ously, and others may not necessarily adversely affect the quality of the patient's life.
It is important that the clinician be able to localize disorders to the PNS. The multitude of reported
neuropathies may seem intimidating, but a working knowledge of all these disorders is unnecessary. Once
the neuroanatomic diagnosis is made (PNS), appropriate reference sources should be consulted in an
attempt to arrive at a specific diagnosis. Knowing that there is a wide spectrum of neuropathies, with
different causes, severities, and prognoses, is important both to patient management and client communica
tion. Disorders of cranial nerve (CN) VIlI (hearing and balance) are discussed in Chapter 8 and will not be
discussed in this chapter.

togcther in this text because of their many clinical similarities.Believed to be an autosomal
recessively inherited trait, this disease is characterized by degeneration of both motor and sensory
axons and myelin throughout the PNS. Nerve fiber degeneration occurs throughout the affcted
nerves in dogs with HPAM, while distal axonal degeneration predominates in dogs affected with
IPAM. The pathogenesis is unknown.
b. Clinical signs typically begin at 10-18 months of age and consist initially of pelvic limb paresis
and ataxia and reduced exercise tolerance. Dogs with IPAM generally present with more severe
clinical signs. Progression of the disease is variable, but worsening paraparesis or tetraparesis, as
well as regurgitation, coughing, and/or dyspnea (due to megaesophagus, laryngeal paresis/
paralysis, and aspiration pneumonia) may develop. Spinal reflexes are usually depressed or absent,
particularly in the pelvic limbs. Moderate to severe muscle atrophy may be appreciated in all
muscles with both forms of the disease. Atrophy may be especially prominent in the shoulder
and thigh areas in cases of HPAM, while dogs with IPAM primarily demonstrate distal muscle
atrophy. Additionally, dogs affected with the latter form may demonstrate appendicular and
paraspinal hyperesthesia.
Diagnosis is based upon history, signalment, and typical clinical features, as well as abnormal

results of electrodiagnostic tests, nerve and muscle biopsies, and/or upon histopathologic post-
mortem findings.
d. The disease is typically progressive, and there is no known treatment. The prognosis for short-
term survival for HPAM varies from favorable to poor, as some dogs will improve, whereas
others will continue to worsen. In general, dogs that improve tend to do so transiently, and often
die or are euthanizeddue toresidualdeficits and/or complications secondaryto thesedeficits
(c.g, paresis, respiratory problems, regurgitation). The prognosis for IPAM is poor, as only
continued progression is typically seen.
2. Dancing Doberman disease27,596:34
a.Seen only in Doberman Pinschers, dancing Doberman disease is an enigmatic peripheral neuro-
myopathy, principally affecting the gastrocnemius muscles. Although clinical and pathological
features suggestive of both nerve and muscle disease have been described, it is unclear whether
this syndrome is primarily a myopathy, a neuropathy, or some combination of the two.
b.
Age at onset of clinical signs of dysfunction has ranged from 6 months to 7 years. The first
observable abnormality is fexing of one pelvic limb while standing (Fig. 14.1). Within several

430
months, these dogs typically will begin alternately fexing and extending both pelvic limbs when
standing, giving the appearance of dancing.Affected dogs often prefer to sit, rather than stand,
are not lame while walking, and do not appear to be in any discomfort. Over time, Dobermans
with this disease can develop conscious proprioceptive deficits and paraparesis. Gastrocnemius
muscle atrophy may also develop. The disease is very slowly progressive (over years) and gencrally
does not adversely change the life of affected dogs.
c.1
Diagnosis is primarily bascd upon the unusual and characteristic clinical findings and ruling out
other causes for the unusual pelvic lmb carriage (e.g, orthopedic diseases, myelopathies, cauda
equina lesions, etc.). Electrodiagnostic testing (especially electromyography [EMG] examination
of the gastrocnemius muscles) and muscle/nerve biopsy results may help support the diagnosis.
d.Despite the fact that there is no trcatment for the disease, the long-term prognosis for an accept-
ablequality oflifeisgood.
a.A distal, symmetric, polyneuropathy with a suspected inherited basis has been reported in Great
Danes. This disease is characterized by distal degeneration of motor axons, with less frequent.
involvement of sensory or autonomic nerve fibers.
b. The reported age of onset has ranged from 1 to 5 years. Clinical signs may present acutely, and
initially include decreased hock flexion and a skipping gait. These reportedly progress over the
following weeks and may progress to include distal hyporefexia and, eventual, recumbency.
C.
 Diagnosis is bascd upon history, signalment, and typical clinical features, as well as abnormal
results of electrodiagnostic tests and nerve and muscle biopsies.
d.A definitive treatment is not currently available for this disorder. The prognosis for affected
animals is considered poor due to the progressive nature of this disease.
a.
This is a disease of Birman kittens, with suspected autosomal recessive inheritance. Loss of
myelin and axons of the PNS and CNS results in clinical signs of disease. The lesions are most
severe in the distal portions of axons, suggesting a dying-back process.Axonal integrity depends
upon anterograde transport of substances (c.g, proteins) from the neuronal cell body throughout
the length of the axon, and retrograde conveyance of cellular waste products from the axon back
to the cell body to be degraded. Disease processes that adversely affect cither the neuronal cell
body or axonal transport mechanisms will likely have most serious consequences on the distal-
most aspect of che axon. As the disease process continues, axonal degeneration will proceed
proximally, dying back toward the neuronal cell body. The pathogenesis of Birman cat distal
polyneuropathy is unknown.
b.Affected kittens exhibit clinical sigus of neurologic dysfunction at approximately 8-10 wecks of
episodes), subtle hypermetria of all four limbs, and plantigrade stance in the pelvic limbs are
characteristic clinical features of the disorder. Kirtens with this disorder also tend to adduct their
hocks.
C.Tentative diagnosis is based upon signalment, historical and clinical findings, and results of
diagnostic tests (e.g, electromyography, nerve/muscle biopsy). Definitive diagnosis is based upon
histopathology of the CNS and PNS lesions.
d. There is no known treatment for this progressive disease and the prognosis is poor.
5. Boxer dog progressive axonopathy25,28,6599,12,126,130.304
a.Boxer dog progressive axonopathy is an autosomal recessively inherited trait characterized by
widespread degeneration of myelin and multiple axonal swellings (spheroids) in both motor and
sensory axons of the central and peripheral ncrvous systems. Central lesions predominate both
within the spinal cord and caudal brain stem (predominantly the spinal tract of the trigeminal
nerve, the rostral olivary,cuneate and accessory cuneate nuclei,and cerebellar white matter and
nuclei). The pathogenesis is unknown,but it is suspected to involve defective slow axonal
14/DISORDERSOFTHEPERIPHERALNERVOUSSYSTEM

transpor, with resultant accumulations of neuroflaments and membranous organelles (constitu-
with secondarydemyelination.
b. Age of onset of clinical signs is typically 2-6 months of age (usually 2-3 months). Pelvic limb
ataxia and hyperrmetria are initially exhibited, and this abnormal gait remains the salient clinical
feature throughout the course of disease progression. Myotactic refexes are decreased or absent,
and decreased muscle tonc is apparent. Muscle atrophy is typically minimal to nonexistent with
this discase.
Ataxia and paresis slowly progress and may also involve the thoracic limbs. Conscious
proprioception (e.g., proprioceptive positioning/placing) is often normal initially, but deteriorates
over time. Pain sensation (nociception) remains intact. Mild signs of cerebellar dysfunction
(ocular tremors, head-bobbing) have been described in a few dogs late in the course of the
discase.
C.A tentative diagnosis can be made based upon signalment, historical and clinical findings, as well
as abnormal results of nerve conduction studies and nerve/muscle biopsies. Spontancous activity
characteristic histopathologic abnormalities (e.g., spheroids) in both the peripheral and central
nervous systems.
d.The prognosis is variable. There is no treatment for this disorder, but some dogs will srabilize by
12-18 months of age, and the clinical signs will remain relatively static for months or even years.
Most of these dogs are eventually euthanized due to inability to ambulate.
6. Giant axonal neuropathy of German Shepherds25.28.65,9.102,103.304
a.Giant axonal neuropathy of German Shepherds is a rare condition characterized by distal axonal
swellings in both sensory and motor axons of the PNS and CNS. There is a loss of both axons
and myelin. The pathogenesis is unknown, but impaired axonal transport mechanisms are
suspected. This is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
noted initially, along with a plantigrade stance. Signs progress to loss of patellar reflexes and
proprioceptive placing reactions and hypotonia of pelvic limb musculature with distal (below the
stife) muscle atrophy. Tetraparesis is typically evident by 18-24 months of age. Voice change,
megacsophagus (with subsequent regurgitation and occasional aspiration pneumonia), and fecal
incontinence also commonly develop within several months of disease onset. A curly hair coat is
also a frequent finding in these dogs.
C.A tentative diagnosis is based upon signalment, historical and clinical fndings, and abnormal
results of electrodiagnostic tests and nerve/muscle biopsies. Lesions are reportedly seen in
Definitive diagnosis hinges upon finding characteristic histopathologic changes in the PNS and
CNS.
d. There is no treatment for this progressive disease and the prognosis is poor.
a.This sensorimotor neuropathy is characterized by widespread loss of peripheral axons (axonal
necrosis), especially in disral segments, in young Dalmatian and Rottweiler dogs. The pathogen-
esis is unknown, although an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is suspected in Dalma-
tians. This disease is thought to involve a dying-back process of axons, affecting distal segments
of axons most severely. Sixteen Dalmatians and five Rottweilcrs have been reported with this
disorder. Six Pyrenean Mountain dogs have been reported with a similar, inherited, laryngeal
paralysis-polyneuropathy complex as well. The authors have encountered a similar condition in a
litter of young Argentinean dogs.
b. Onset of clinical signs is typically from 2 to 6 months of age in Dalmatians and between 2 and 3
months of age in Rorrweilers. Clinical signs relating to laryngeal paralysis, including respiratory
432
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEAND FELINENEUROLOGY
distress (e.g., inspiratory stridor, coughing, cyanosis, dyspnea), with associated excrcise intoler-
ance, and voice change (dysphonia) are commonly seen. Limb paresis (worse in the pelvic limbs
in Rottweilers) with hyporeflexia is also a consistent clinical feature. Gagging, regurgitation (due
t0 a megaesophagus), facial and lingual paralysis, hypermetric gait, and muscle atrophy are
additional clinical signs associated with the Dalmatian disease. One of five Rottweiler puppies
displayed regurgitation associated with megaesophagus. A peculiar finding in the affected
Rottweilers was bilateral cataracts, seen in four of the five dogs; the cause of these cataracts was
undetermined.
C.A tentative diagnosis of this disorder is based upon signalment, history, characteristic clinical
findings, and abnormal results of diagnostic tests (e.g, lecrodiagnostics, nerve/muscle biopsies).
Definitive diagnosis of this disorder is based upon the character and distribution of axonal lesions
identified postmortem.
d. There is no treatment for this disorder. The prognosis is poor, as most dogs die or are euthanized
shortly after presentation due to respiratory dysfunction, often involving severe aspiration
pneumonia.
8. Inherited Polyneuropathy of Leonberger dogs65.271,28
a.A distal polyneuropathy with presumed X-linked inheritance has been reported in Leonberger
dogs, which shares many pathologic and genetic characteristics with the Charcor-Marie-Tooth
axonal neuropathy seen in humans. his disorder is characterized by chronic, progressive, distal
distal polyneuropathy, although an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is suspected in this
breed.
b. The age of onset of clinical signs in Leonberger dogs has reportedly ranged from 1 to 9 years of
age, although the majority have been 1 to 3 years of age at presentation. In contrast, Italian
Spinoni dogs typically present between 8 to 10 years of age. Affected dogs show exercisc intoler-
ance, distal muscle atrophy, decreased spinal and cranial nerve refexes, and laryngcal paralysis/
paresis.Hip and stife hyperfexion while ambulating is also classically seen, along with a ten-
dency to“throw”the foot forward during the pelvic limb's swing phase.Facial nerve paralysis
and/or a decreased gag refex have been infrequently reported.
C.A presumptive diagnosis can be made based upon signalment, historical and clinical findings, as
well as abnormal results of electrodiagnostic testing and corroborating muscle/nerve biopsy
results.
d.Symptomatic treatments, such as surgical lateralization of the arytenoid cartilage to improvc
respiratory function, may improve quality of life. However, definitive treatments are not yct
available.
Although disease sevcrity appears to vary among affected dogs, long-term prognosis is
considered guarded.A subset of dogs will continuously deteriorate,becoming tetraplegic or
developing complications from laryngeal dysfunction, such as aspiration pneumonia.
321-323.343,347
occur in two major forms. The first form is a hereditary disease of immature animals (less than
12 months of age), and the second form is an acquired (also referred to as idiopathic laryngeal
paralysis) disorder of middle-aged to older dogs and cats. Both forms appear to be much more
common in dogs than cats. In both disorders, denervation atrophy of the cricoarytenoideus
dorsalis muscle and axonal and myelin loss in the recurrent laryngeal nerve(s) are characteristic
features. The pathogenesis is unknown for both forms of laryngeal paralysis. Specific information
pertaining to the two forms of this neuropathy is as follows.
(1) Hereditary laryngeal paralysis: Hereditary laryngeal paralysis is best described for the Bouvier
des Flandres breed, in which the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. An
14 / DISORDERS OF THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
433
inherited basis for this disorder has also been proposed in Siberian Huskies and in a litter of
Siberian Husky-Alaskan Malamute crossbreed dogs. Recurrent laryngeal nerve degeneration is
due to neuronal degeneration in the nucleus ambiguus of the brain stem. Onset of clinical
signs is typically betwecn 4 and 6 months of age. However, age of onset of clinical signs has
young Siberian Husky and Huslcy-crossbred dogs, Bull Terriers, Rortweilers, and white-coated
German Shepherd dogs.
(2) Acquired (idiopathic) laryngeal paralysis: This is encountered rnost comnonly in older, large-
and giant-breed dogs such as Labrador Retrievers, Saint Bernards, Irish Setters, and Afghan
Hounds. A high likelihood of older dogs presenting with laryngeal paralysis having underly.
was reported as 11 years in one study. A focal pharyngeal-laryngeal blastomycosis infection
has bcen reported in one dog, with a clinical presenration indistinguishable from idiopathic
laryngeal paralysis cases. Laryngeal paralysis secondary to a pulmonary squamous cell carci-
noma has also becn rcported in a cat.
b. Clinical signs reflect dysfunction of the arytenoid cartilages and vocal folds and includc dyspho-
nia, inspiratory noise (stridor), and respiratory distress (especially when exercising). Retching.
gagging, and coughing associared with eating and drinking may also be appreciated Concurrent
megacsophagus has been reported with laryngeal paralysis in a small percentage of both canine
and feline cascs. Clinical signs tend to progress in severity over several months. Clinical signs
related to generalizcd neuromuscular disease, such as exercise intolerance, muscle atrophy, and
absent patellar refexcs have been reported.
C.Both forms of this neuropathy are diagnosed by historical and clinical features and by ruling out
other causes of laryngeal paresis/paralysis (e.g, neuromuscular junction disorders, hypothyroid-
ism). Assessiment of vocal fold movement during standard laryngoscopy may bc used ro confirm
laryngeal paralysis. A light plane of anesthesia is rccommended for this procedure, as anestheric
agents may impair vocal fold movement. Thiopental, given intravenously to effect, has been
shown to Icast infuence laryngoscopy results. The CNS stimulant doxapram reportedly improves
visualization of laryngeal paralysis, but may also temporarily worsen airway obstruction, neces-
sitating the intubation of affected dogs. Effective vocal fold evaluation in sedated dogs has also
been reported using transnasal laryngoscopy. Abnormal EMG activity in the cricoarytenoideLs
dorsalis muscle and neurogenic atrophy appreciated in biopsy samples of this muscle support the
diagnosis. A full electrodiagnostic evaluation should be peformed to rule out generalized neuro-
muscular disease, paricularly if corresponding neurologic signs are present. Lastly, sound spectro-
gram analysis may provide a noninvasive method of detecting laryngeal paralysis.
d. Clinical signs tend to progress in both forms of this disease. Absent patellar rcfexes havc been
associated with a worse prognosis in affcted dogs, likely due to their association with generalized
neuromuscular disease. Other than exercise restriction and avoiding stressful situations, there is
no effectivc medical treatment to halt or impede disease progression. However, many patients
will do well with corrective surgery (c.g., arytenoid lateralization). Corrective surgery for canine
arytenoid lateradization. Bilateral surgery has also bcen associated with a higher risk of recurrence
of clinical signs in affected dogs. The most common postoperative complication was aspiration
pneumonia. The placement of low-tension sutures during unilateral cricoarytenoid lateralization
may bc associatedwith alower incidence of aspiration pneumonia,while still achieving suffcient
vocal fold abduction.Minor complications include continued coughing, gagging. or exercise
intolerance. Seroma formation at the surgery site has also been reported. Minor complications

treatment of this disorder with either an endoscopically inserted cricoid implant or with a
calcium hydroxyapatite vocal fold injection have also been reported. Similarly, preliminary
evidence has shown that surgical re-innervation of the laryngeal muscles or functional electrical
stimulation of laryngeal adductor muscles may be effective treatments for this disorder, although
full clinical evaluations of these procedures are not yet available.
10.Rottweilerdistalsensorimotorpolyneuropathy
25,28,8,
a.1
Distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of young adult Rottweilers is characterized by widespread
loss of axons (axonal nccrosis) and myelin in both motor and sensory nerves of the PNS, espe-
cially in the terminal axonal segments. This appears to be a dying-back neuropathy, but the
specific pathogenesis is unknown. The disease appears to be reminiscent of a human neuropathy
termed hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) type I. Rottweiler distal sensorimo-
tor polyneuropathy is similar in many respects to a syndrome reported sporadically in large dogs
of various breeds (e.g, Irish Serter crossbred dogs, Great Danes, German Shepherds) referred to
as distal symmetric polyneuropathy.
b.
The dogs reported with this disease ranged in age from 1.5 to 4 years at the time of clinical
disease onset. The clinical course consists of paraparesis initially that slowly progresses to tetrapa-
resis, with hyporefexia and hypotonia, and atrophy of distal limb muscles. The disease is typi
cally slowly progressive (sometimes over a year) and may even wax and wane, although acute
decreased nociception and masticatory muscle atrophy.

Diagnosis is based upon signalment, historical and clinical findings, and abnormalities noted on
clectrodiagnostic testing (especially EMG of distal limb muscles) and nerve/muscle biopsies.
d.Some dogs seem to transiently respond to glucocorticoid therapy, but this is a progrcssive disease
with no known treatment. The long-term prognosis is guarded to poor.

is unknown, but abnormal Schwann cell function is suspected.
b. The affected puppies exhibited an ataxic, mildly paretic pelvic limb gait at 7 weeks of age. Mid
pelvic limb muscle atrophy, a crouched pelvic limb stance, and bunny-hopping while running
were also observed. The puppies improved clinically over time.

a.Megaesophagus can rcsult from a number of diseases of nerve, muscle, neuromuscular junctions,
or gastrointestinal tract. Additionall, megaesophagus may be seen secondary to vascular ring
anomalies or a persistent left cranial vena cava. A predisposition to esophageal dysmotility
without megaesophagus, likely representing delayed esophageal maturation, has been reported in
animals and the acquired (idiopathic) disorder of adult animals. Congenital and acquircd mcga
esophagus are more common in dogs than cats. Both forms of mcgacsophagus may represent a
neuropathy (motor and/or sensory) affccting the vagus nerves, but there is no compelling
evidence to support this. In short, borh forms of megaesophagus are idiopathic.
b. Clinical signs of megaesophagus usually include regurgitation and secondary respiratory problems
due to aspiration pneumonia. Congenital megaesophagus has been reported primarily in Great
Danes, German Shepherd dogs, Irish setters, Newfoundlands, Greyhounds, Shar Peis, Miniature
Schnauzers, and Wire-haired Fox Terriers. In the latter two dog breeds, this has been shown to
be an inherited disease. Congenital megaesophagus has also been reported in Siamese cats.
cats with disorclers of esophageal motility, 30% were congenital, and 43% were idiopathic
acquired.
c.  Diagnosis of both congenital and acquircd idiopathic megaesophagus is based rmainly upon
signalment, historical and clinical findings (particularly radiographic evidence of megaesophagus;
Fig. 14.2), and ruling out othcr causes of megaesophagus. Especially in adult animals, therc is a
multitde of potential causes of megaesophagus. These causcs should he ruled out before assign-
ing a diagnosis of idiopathic acquired Inegaesophagus.
d.Thcre is no specifie tfeatrment for these idiopathic conditions. Patients should either be fed with
thcir hcads clevated or preferably via a gastrostomy tube. Antacids (e.g., cimetidine) and moility
modifers (e.g, metoclopramide, cisapride) may be helpful in decreasing gastric acidity (decreased
lung damage with aspiration) and increasing gastroesophageal sphincrer tone, respectively These
motility modifying agents have not been shown to improve esophageal function in dogs. In dogs
with megaesophagus, increasing gastroesophageal sphincter tone may be counterproductive if the

with esophageal motility disorders exhibit clinical improvcement when treated with motility
modifers. The difference between dogs and cats in regard to clinical response to motility modi-
fiers is likely due to the large proportion of smooth muscle in the feline esophagus. Metoclo-

megaesophagus. In these latter dogs, the combination of severe malnutrition and recurrent

these patients, and th potential for severe,recurrent aspiration pneumonia is high.
a.Idiopathic facial paralysis is an acute mononeuropathy of one (usually) or both facial nerves that
has been reported in dogs and cats. The pathogenesis is unknown, but a similar condition occurs
inhumans (Bellspalsy).There is some evidence in thehuman medical literature that Bell's palsy
is due to an immune-mediated response triggered by herpes simplex viral infection. Histopatho-
logic evidence of axonal and myelin loss, without evidence of infammation, has been described
with thisdisorder.
b.Affected animals are usually middle-aged to older (e.g., over 5 years of age). Although this
problem has been reported in a number of breeds, Cocker Spaniels appear to be consistently
overrepresented. Clinical signs reflect acute dysfunction of one or both (uncommonly) facial
nerves. Drooping of the ears and lips, deviation of the nasal philtrum toward the normal side (if
unilateral paralysis),decreased to absent palpebral reflex and menace response, and excessve
salivation on the affected side are all typical clinical findings (Fig. 14.3). Some patients will have
trouble keeping food from dropping out of the lips on the affected side. Corneal ulceration may
occur, both due to inadequate blinking ability and interruption of the parasympathetic input to
the lacrimal gland (in the facial nerve). Though uncommon, some patients may also exhibit signs
of vestibular dysfunction (CN VIIl; see Chapter 8).
c.Diagnosis is based on characteristichistorical and clinical findings and ruling out other causes of

bear inmind that CockerSpaniels arepredisposed toboth otitis and hypothyroidism.

a.
Believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, this disorder is characterized by degcnera-
tion of principally distal sensory axons in both the PNS and CNS. The pathogenesis of this
disorder is unknown. A similar disorder has been reported in a Jack Russell Terrier and four
Border Collies. An experimentally induced sensory neuropathy with distal axonal degeneration,
secondary to chronic dietary deficiencies of phenylalanine and tyrosine,has also been reported in
cats.
b.Clinical signs of dysfunction may be evident by 8-12 weeks of age and include mild ataxia, loss
of proprioception (especially in the pelvic limbs),and widespread reduction or loss of superficial
and deep pain perception. Some patients may exhibit vomiting and/or urinary incontinence,
presumably due to degenerative changes in the autonomic nervous system. Self-mutilation may
also be exhibited. There is no evidence of muscular atrophy in these dogs, and spinal reflexcs
may be normal or slightly reduced.
Diagnosis is made via history, signalment, and clinical findings, along with results of electro
diagnostic testing (decreased to absent sensory nerve potentials) and muscle/nerve biopsy.
d.The prognosis for this disorder is poor, due to the progressive nature of the disordr and/r the
severity of clinical signs.
a.An autosomal,recessively inherited sensory polyncuropathy has been reported in English Pointer
dogs as well as Czechoslovakian Shorthaired Pointer dogs. This condition has also been reported
in 13 French Spaniels with presumed autosomal recessive inheritance.The pathogenesis is
unknown, but the disease is characterized by loss of sensory neurons (as well as their axonal
processes and myelin) and an associated lack of an important nociceptive neurotransmitter called
substanceP
b. Clinical signs typically become apparent between 2 and 12 months of age. There is loss of pain
perception to the distal aspect of the paws (e.g., the toes) and decreased pain sensation proximal
to the carpus and tarsus. There is the posibility that paresthesia/ dysesthesia may contribute to
the clinical picture. The dogs begin to lick and then chew their digits, ultimately leading to
autoamputations (Fig. 14.4). Apparently painless fractures and osteomyclitis of the paw may
occur.There are no other neurologic deficits,other than altered pain perception to the distal
limbs.

nerve biopsy results. Results of electrodiagnostic tests are normal in this disease. Definitive

diagnosis is based upon histopathologic evaluation of spinal ganglia, axonal processes of the
sensory nuclei of those ganglia (both in the PNS and CNS), and a lack of staining for substance
P in the spinal cord.
d. There is no effective treatment for this disorder and the prognosis is poor.
18. Idiopathic self-mutilation26,28,92,120,238,256.319
a.Also known as acral lick dermatitis,this self-mutilatory behavior of “high-strung”breeds of dogs
and cats (e.g., Doberman Pinschers, German Shepherd dogs, Siamese and Abyssinian cats) may
be due to a mild sensory polyneuropathy. There is electrophysiologic and histopathologic evi-
unknown.
b. Clinical signs of this disorder are usually limited to licking, biting, or scratching an area of skin
around the tarsal or carpal areas.
C.1
Diagnosis of this syndrome is typically based on standard historical and clinical findings in a
“nervous" or “high-strung” pet. Other dermatologic conditions should be ruled out. Some
patients will respond (decreased self-mutilation behavior) to the tricyclic antidepressant drug
clomipramine, at a dose of 1-3 mg/kg per os, per day. Secondary skin infections should be
treated with appropriate antibiotic regimens.
d. The prognosis for control of this condition is good.
a.
 Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) represents a spectrum of uncommon disease syndromes charac-
terized by premature degeneration of motor neurons primarily in the spinal cord and, to a
variable degree, the brain stem. There are multiple forms of SMA described in a number of dog
breeds, with various clinical presentations and levels of severity. In some forms of the disease,
there may also be cerebellar neuronal degeneration. It is currently not clear as to whether all of
these disorders belong in the same category (e.g., SMA) or if some should be classified as multi-
system neuronal degeneration.
Most of these disorders appear to bc analogous to infantile spinal muscular atrophy of
humans, with onsets of dysfunction occurring during the first several weeks to months of life.
Adult-onset SMA, similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) of people
and equine motor neuron disease,is rarely reported in dogs and cats.The pathogenesis of this
disease is unknown, but SMA is believed to represent an abiotrophy, or premature cell death.
These disorders are suspected or proven, depending upon the specific disorder, to be autosomally
inherited traits. In the most completely studied form of this disease syndrome, hereditary SMA
of Brittany Spaniels (autosomal dominant inheritance), there is evidence that both abnormal
cytoskeletal neuronal protein production (e.g., neurofilaments) and imbalances of excitatory CNS
neurotransmitters (e.g., aspartate, glutamate) are linked to premature neuronal cell death.
439
b. Spinal muscular atrophy has been reported in numerous breeds, including Brittany Spaniels.
several cats, The typical clinical picture is that of a rapidly progressing polyneuropathy (LMN
paresis) in the frst I-6 months of life, mainly or exclusively affecting the limbs. Paresis with
decreased to absent spinal reflexes and neurogenic muscle atrophy usually progresses to paralysis
within weeks. Pelvic limb parcsis typically ocurs prior to thoracic limb paresis. Limb joints may
become malpositioned and immovable, subsequent to pronounced muscle atrophy. Some dogs
have a more protracted disease course, with less severe signs. For example, the German Shepherd
dog disease appears to be an asymmetric, focal loss of motor neurons in the cervical intumes-
cence, with relatively static unilateral or bilateral thoracic limb dysfunction. The accelerated
(homozygous) form of the Brittany Spaniel SMA follows the typical pattern of early onset and
rapid disease progression. However, the intermediate form has an onset at 6-12 months of age
at onsct as the interinediate form, but is nearly suhclinical.
Somc brceds will exhibit signs of brain stcm (c.g., dysphonia, megaesophagus, tongue
fasciculations) or cerebellar (e.g., head tremor) dysfunction, in addition to thc LMN signs to thc
limbs. Apparent cataplectic episodes havc been observed in the Cairn Terricr disease. This
disorder may belong in thc category of multisystem neuronal degeneration (see Chaprer 5),
rather than SMA.
C.A tentative diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy is based upon signalment, historical and clinical
findings, and abnormal results of electrodiagnostic testing and nerve/muscle biopsies. A definitive
d. There is currently no effective treatment for this group of diseases, and the prognosis for the
majority of them is poor. There is recent evidencc that 4-aminopyridine, a drug that can hoth
improve axonal conduction and increase acetylcholine release at the ncuromuscular junction, may
hold some promisc as a potential therapy for SMA patients. Despite the poor prognosis overall,
Brirtany Spaniels with intermcdiatc and chronic forins of the disease may do well for years. The
German Shepherd dog discase also appears to be self-limiting.
20. Canine and feline dysautonomia?
28,7,53,8,96,99,21,135,176,186,203,204,232,239,248,250,274,277,282,283,04,305,335,
a. Dysautonomia is a degenerative polyneuropathy of thc autonomic nervous system of unknown
pathogencsis in dogs and cats. Degeneration and loss of ncuronal ccll bodics occurs to various
degrees in parasympathetic and sympathctic ganglia, intermediolateral columns of the spinal
cord, and parasympatheric nuclei of chc brain stem. The tendency for cases of dysauronomia to
cluster in certain geographic regions (e.g., Missouri, Kansas) suggests either a toxic or infectious
etiology. A genetic infuence on susceptibility to dysautonomia has also been proposed. Risk
factors for developmenr of dysautonomia in dogs have been identified. Living in rural areas,
consumption of wildlife (e.g., bircds, rabbits), spending the majority of time outdoors, and access
to cattle, pasture land, and farm ponds are all associated with development of canine dysautono-
mia. Most cases of canine dysautonomia are identified between the months of February and
April.
b. Although a wide age range has been reported, most dogs and cats aflicred with this disease are
young aduts. In one report of canine dysautonomia, the median agc at onset of clinical signs
was 14 months and in another it was 18 months. Clinical signs develop rclativcly quickly (usually
within 48 hours in cats, within 2 wecks in dogs) and primarily reflecr patasyrmpathetic dysfunc
tion. However, chronic progrcssive autonomic dysfunction has been reported in a dog, whose
clinical signs progresscd over a 4-year period. Consistently reported abnorinalities include
Inydriasis with absent pupillary light reflexes, dry mucous membranes (often with associated

cific clinical signs of lethargy, wcight. loss, and dehydration are also commonly observed,
C. A tentativc diagnosis is bascd primarily on clinical signs of autonomic dysfunction. Orthostatic
hypotension has also becn reported in affected dogs. Pharrmacologic testing (e.g., pilocarpine
ocular drops, bethanechol challenge) can also be performed to confirm abnormal auronomic
receptor function (i.e., denervation hypersensitivity). Dysautonomic patients tend to demonstrate
miosis shortly after ocular installation of 12 drops of dilute (0.05%-0.1%) pilocarpine. These
patients also tend to exhibit improved ability to urinate after subcutaneous administration of a
low dose (0.04 mg/kg) of bethanechol. Definitive diagnosis requires demonstrating neuronal cell
loss in the parasympathetic nervous system postmorrem.
d.There is no specific treatment for this diseasc, and spontaneous clinical recoveries are uncom-
mon. Recovery has been reported in cats, However, this recovery may not begin to be apparent
for scvcral months and may takc a prolonged period of tine. During this convalcscent time,
intensivc nursing care, including rube-feeding, bladder expression, enemas, correction/prevention
of electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration, and antiemetic administration (e.g., metoclo-
pramide) may be required of the owner. Survival of scvcrely affected cats has been estimated to
be between 25% and 50% with such supportive trcatmcnt. Bradycardia may be a negative
prognostic indicator. Most patients with dysautonomia either dic or are euthanized due to
complications of the disease.
 Some of the lysosomal storagc diseases discussed in Chapter 5 can have periphcral polyneuropa-
thy as part of the clinical syndrome. In some cases, a peripheral polyneuropathy may be the only
clinical abnormality (c.g., Niemann-Pick disease in Siamese cats). The lysosomal storage diseases
that may include signs of polyueuropathy as part of the clinical picture include the following.
(2) Globoid celeukodystrophy (Krabbe's discase): a sphingolipidosis most common in West
Highland White and Cairn Terriers.
(3) Glycogen storage disease type IV: a glycogenosis reported in Norwcgian Forest cats.
(4) Nicmann-Pick disease: a sphingolipidosis reported in Siamese and Balincse cats.
b. Clinical signs for most of these disorders reffect multifocal disease of the nervous syseem. Tenta-
tive diagnosis is based upon historical and clinical findings, abnormal electrodiagnostic test
results, and lesions supportive of the suspected disorder in muscle/neive biopsies, Diminished
enzyime activity (of the suspected enzyme of interest) in leukocytes, skin biopsies, or cultured
cells (e.g., skin fibroblasts, hepatocytes) may be used as a confirmatory diagnostic test in some of
these disorders.
C. There is no trearment for these progressive diseascs, and the prognosis is poor.
1. Optic nervc hypoplasia is an idiopathic congeniral condition uncommouly reported in dogs and rarc
in cars. There is a lack of neurons in the ganglion layer of the retina and atrophy of the optic nervc.
Other concurrent ocular abnormalities (retinal dysplasia, retinal detachment) havc been rcported.
Optic nerve hypoplasia can occur eirher unilaterally or bilaterally.
2. This condition is believed to be a heritable trait in Miniaturc Poodles. lr has been reported in. a
nurnber of differennt breeds, however. Diagnosis is based upon a hisrory of visual problems from
opening of the eyelids in infancy, clinical signs of blindness, mydriasis, and absent direct pupillary
light reflex on the affected side(s), and ophthalmoscopic findings of a small optic disk on the affected
side(s).

C. Metabolic
a.A polyneuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus has been described in both dogs and cats.
Historicall, the prevailing thought has been that this neuropathy primarily refccts a distal
(dying back) axonopathy with secondary demyelination/remyelination.However, morc rcccnt
evidence suggcsts that abnormal Schwan cell/myelin function may play a pivotal role in the
development of diaberic neuropathy, with axonal damage being comparatively less important.
The pathogenesis of axonal and Schwann cel/myelin dysfunction is unknown, but several
hypotheses exist. It is likcly that cerrain aspects of allthese hypotheses act in concert to effect
peripheral nerve dysfunction. The threc hypotheses include the following:
(1) Vascular hypothesis: Microvascular disease is known to occur with diabetcs mcllitus. The
mechanisms responsible for microvascular compromise are not clearly defincd but may
include decreased vasodilatory molecules (e.g, prostacyclin, prostaglandin E) and increased
vasoconstrictive molecules (e.g., thromboxane A2, endothelin) in vascular endothelium, due
to altered lipid 1netabolism; abnorimally functioning hemoglobin and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate,
due to protein glycosylation; and thrombosis subsequent to altered vessel compliance (accu-
mulation of glycosylated molecules in and around endothelial cells) and increased red blood
cell and platelet aggregation (altered blood fow dynamics and imbalance of vasodilatative/
vasoconstrictive substances). Abnormal thickcning of the perineurium (the sheath surround
ing fascicles of myelinatced axons in pcripheral nerve) of diabetic dogs has been reported. This
thickened perineurium may also lead to vascular compromise of the axons and Schwann cel/
myclin. Interference with the microcirculation to the peripheral nerves may result in ischemia
and axonal/myelin degeneration.
(2) Metabolic hypothesis: Several cellular metabolic aberrations occur in the diabetic state that
may inrerfere with axonal conduction and Schwann cell/myelin function. Most of these
metabolic alterations are linked to the polyol pathway, which is dependent on the enzyme
aldose reductase. There is increased activity of the polyol pathway due to excess glucose
substrate, with subsequent accumulation of sorbitol. Sorbitol accumulation leads to depletion
of myoinositol, a molecule necessary for normal function of cellular Na²/K ATPase. Myoino
sitol is also an integral component of several membrane phospholipids. In addition, sorbitol
is slowly rnetabolized to fructose. During this oxidative process, membrane-damaging free
radical species (e.g, superoxide, nitric oxide) may be produced. Finally, cxcessive intracellular
glucosc may lead to nonenzyrmatic glycosylation of proteins necessary for normal cell metabo-
lism and axonal rransport mechanisms, altering the functional capabiliries of those proteins.
Any one or a combination of these metabolic alterations may adversely affect axonal and
Schwann cell/myelin function.
(3) Immune-mediated hypothesis: In addition to vascular and metabolic disturbances thiat
secondarily affect axonal integrity, there may be more direct, autoimmune-related axonal/
myelin disease concurrent with the diabetic condition. There are data to support immuno-
logic mechanisms as being involved in diabetic neuropathy. There is some evidence that
autoantibodies (e.g., against phospholipids) also tend to cause vascular thrombosis, providing
another possible mechanism for microvascular nerve injury.
b. Clinical signs in dogs are quite variable and range fromm a subclinical disorder (diagnosed via
electrodiagnostics and nerve/muscle biopsy) to severe LMN tetraparesis/tetraplegia with profound
neurogenic muscle atrophy. The typical clinical scenario in both dogs and cats is symmetric
pelvic limb IMN paresis with proprioceptive deficitrs, decrcased refexes, and rmuscle atrophy.
442

Bilateral Horner's syndrome has also been reported with concurrent diabetesmellitus.In this
case,resolution of clinical signs was sccn once glycemic control was attained.The clinical picture
of cats with diabetic neuropathy is more consistent than that of dogs. These cats usually exhibit a
plantigrade posture in the pelvic limbs with their hocks touching the ground (Fig. 14.5).
Decrcased patellar refexes, proprioceptive deficits, and muscle atrophy are also characteristic
findings. Cats appear less likely than dogs to develop clinical signs of weakness in the thoracic
limbs, although a palmigrade stance has been reported in cats with a diabetic neuropathy.
C.
Diagnosis depends upon confirming the presence of a polyneuropathy in a patient with diabetes
mellitus and ruling out other likely causes of polyneuropathy. Abnormalities are typically found
with electrodiagnostic test results and muscle/nerve biopsies, supporting the diagnosis. Thesc
have been reported in motor, sensory, and mixed nervcs.An autonomic neuropathy has also been
reported in dogs with diabetes mellitus.
d. Currently, there is no specific therapy proven effective for improving the polyneuropathy, but
spontaneous resolution may occur after control of the diabetic condition is achieved. The
prognosis remains guarded, however, since patients may not recover function, even with adequate
diabetic control.
 2. Hyperadrenocorticoid (Cushing's) neuropathy23,28,180
a.There is evidence of an association between hypcradrenocorticism and polyneuropathy in dogs.
Some, but not all, of these dogs have had a concurrent hyperadrenocorticoid myopathy (see
Chapter 13). The pathogenesis is unknown.
b.There is currently little knowledge available concerning the typical clinical features and prognosis
for recovery for this suspcted endocrine neuropathy.
3. Hyperchylomicronemia in cats232.5.6,99,14,175,304,30
a.Hyperchylomicronemia is a deficiency of the hormone lipoprotein lipase that is believed to be
inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Accumulations of granulomatous masses of lipid and
coagulated blood (xanthomas) accumulate in various tissues. The xanthomas in the nerve roots
and peripheral nerves cause a compressive neuropathy, with loss of axons and myelin.
b. Affected cats may have fasting hyperlipemia, giving their blood a “cream of tomato soup”
coloration.Lipemia retinalis, a pallid appearance to the retinal vasculature apparent on fundu
initially seen from 1 to 8 months of age. A wide variety of neurologic abnormalities may be
identified, including Horner's syndrome, paresis/paralysis of the trigeminal, facial, and recurrent
laryngeal nerves, as well as motor and proprioceptive loss to radial,femoral, peroneal, and tibial
nerves.Unilateral deficits arc common.

 Diagnosis is based upon historical and clinical findings, demonstration of reduced serurn lipopro-

hypothyroidism and neuropathies in dogs. The pathogenesis by which the hypothyroid state may

esophagus, and LMN paresis/paralysis of the limbs. An association between hypothyroidism and
acquired myasthenia gravis (Chapter 16) may exist in dogs. Since many of the clinical signs for
these two disorders arc similar, both disorders should be ruled out in suspect cases.
C.
Diagnosis is based upon confiriming the existence of hypothyroidism in a dog with a neuropathy.
The presence of a neuropathy can be confirmed in many cases based upon abnormal results of
clectrodiagnostic tests and muscle/nerve biopsies. Proving a dog to be truly hypothyroid may be
administered thyroid-stimulating hormonc (TSHI response test). Thyroid-stimulating hormone
may be expensive and/or difficult to obtain. Also, some test results fall into a “gray zone” that
may or may not be supporivc of bypothyroidism. Measuring free thyroxine (free T) levels by
equilibrium dialysis is believed to be a relatively accurate assessment of thyroid functional status.
Concurrently measuring serum TSH levels has been suggested, with elevated TSH levels expected
inl cases of primary hypothyroidism. A clinically acceptable method of tentatively diagnosing
hypothiyroid neuropathy is response to thyroid supplementation therapy in a suspect patient
(neuropathy with a low resting T level).

with most dogs showing resolution of their clinical signs in 1-2 months of trearment.
D. Neoplastic
1.Pa
a.Both subclinical and clinical mononeuropathies and polyneuropathies have been associated with
various neoplasms. Thcsc ncuropathies are believed to develop as an indirect rather than a
primary effect of the underlying neoplasia. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon is unknown,
but severalhypotheses exist.Potential explanationsincludeclaboration of some neurotoxicfacton
by the tumor, disruption of axonal and/or Schwann cell metabolism by the tumor, and an
immunologic reaction to antigens shared by the neoplasm and periphcral nerve elements(i.e.,
with pancreatic insulinomas, and the potential exists for the associated hypoglyccmia to be
responsible for the neuropathy. However, peripheral nerves are particularly resistant to the effects
of hypoglycemia, and peripheral neuropathy has not been associated with any othcr disease that
results in hypoglycemia. Consequently, the hypoglycemia may not be a major contributing facton
to thisparaneoplastic neuropathy; a secondary effect of theinsulinoma may make theperipheral
b. Clinical signs are variable and may range from a subclinical neuropathy to severe LMN tetraple
gia. Diagnosis of a neuropathy depends upon clinical findings and results of electrodiagnostic
testing and muscle/nerve biopsies. The existence of this phenomenon makes it imperative to rule
out the presence of neoplasia in animals presenting with neuropathies, especially older patients.
Diagnosis of an insulinoma is usually based upon an abnormal amended serum insulin/glucose
ratio and sometimes identification of the pancreatic tumor via ultrasound or exploratory
laparotomy.
c.Treatment is directed toward the underlying neoplasia. There is no specific treatment for the
associated neuropathy. The clinician should bear in mind that some antineoplastic drugs (e.g.
vincristine) can lead to neuropathies.
d.
Although full neurologic recovery following tumor resection has been reported, the overall
primary tumor) in dogs and cats is presently unknown. In people with paraneoplastic neuropa-
thies, the prognosis is often poor for recovery. Prognosis for control of the underlying neoplasia
depends largely upon the type and location of the rumor(s).
a.Malignant nerve sheath tumors (MNST) arise in the cranial and peripheral nerve roots and
nerves primarily in dogs, but rarely in cats. The traditional nomenclature for these neoplasms is
confusing and of limited clinical use. Schwannomas, neurofibromas, neurofbrosarcomas, and other
terms all refer to malignant nerve sheath tumors with identical clinical features.Lymphosarcoma,
 malignant sarcomas, and hamartomas occasionally involve peripheral nerves as well.
b.MNSTs typically affect older dogs. Clinical signs of dysfunction depend upon the location of the
tumor. MNSTs can involve spinal nerves and nerve roots at any location throughout the spine
and can lead to secondary spinal cord compression. These tumors can also involve nerve roots of
the cauda equina or peripheral nerves. An intraocular MNST, arising from the ciliary nerve, has
also been reported in a dog. The most common site for a MNST is the nerve roots or nerves of
thebrachial plexus.Affected dogs typically exhibit a progressive (over weeks to months) thoracic
limb lameness for which no musculoskeletal explanation can be found. Generalized soft tissue
swelling of the affected limb has also been reported secondary to a MNST. Depending upon
which nerve(s) is/are involved, there may or may not be evidence of proprioceptive loss or
neurogenic muscle atrophy in the affected limb. Gentle palpation of the axillary space of the
affected limb and caudal retraction of the affected limb, may both elicit a painful rcsponse from

the patient. The cutaneous trunci (panniculus) refex may also be deficient on the affected side.
Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, proprioceptive and/or motor deficits in other limbs, and neck pain
all suggest extension of the tumor into the vertebral canal.
The cranial nerve most commonly afficted with MNST is the trigeminal nerve. Clinical
signs of dysfunction in these dogs include ipsilateral neurogenic atrophy of the muscles of
mastication, ipsilateral loss of facial sensation, and Horner's syndrome. If the intracranial portion
of CN V is involved, other signs of brain stem dysfunction may develop over time (due to
compression).
c.A tentative diagnosis is based upon signalment, historical and clinical findings, and abnormal
results of electrodiagnostic testing, imaging, and possible cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) analysis
(usually if imaging is performed). Erythrocytosis secondary to a MNST may also be seen.
MNSTs of the brachial plexus can sometimes be difcult or impossible to diagnose with these
various tests. Identification of brachial plexus tumors with ultrasonography as tubular hypoechoic
masses with no demonstrable blood fow has also been described, along with ultrasound-guided
biopsy of the identified lesion. However, due to the potential for false negative results with this
test, additional imaging is recommcnded if a MNST is suspected but not identified with ultraso-
nography. Computed tomography (CT) T and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offer the
potential of imaging both the axillary portion and the spinal portion of a brachial plexus MNST
as compared with myelography (Fig. 14.6). A CT/myelography combination may also be a
valuable imaging option for this disease.MR imaging is the imaging modality of choice for
evaluating MNSTs of cranial nerves (e.g., CN V). The typical appearance of an MNST that
involves the spinal cord is that of an intradural/extramedullary mass, although they may also
appear as intramedullary or extradural lesions.Contrast enhancement is frequently seen.Exten-
sion of MNSTs arising from within the spinal canal through destruction of surrounding vertebral
bone, with extension into the overlying epaxial muscles, may also be sccn on MR imaging. A
definitive diagnosis can be obtained with histopathologic analysis of biopsied tissue or at the time
of tumor excision. The immunohistochemical characteristics of MNSTs in dogs have been
described and may be helpful in differentiating MNST from other sarcomas.
d.Definitive treatment for MNST, regardless of location, involves surgical removal of the neoplasm.
The responsiveness of these sarcomatous tumors to radiation therapy is unknown. Although
there are sporadic reports of long-term survival following surgical removal of these tumors, the
overall prognosis is poor. MNSTs tend to recur after surgical removal. Surgical removal of
brachial plexus MNSTs usually involves amputation of the affected limb with or without a
446
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
laminectomy procedure (depending upon whether or not there is tumor invasion into the
vertebral canal). However, the median disease-free interval after surgery for these dogs is
extrermely short,especially when there is spinal cord involvement (approximately I month).
3. Mononuclear cell neoplasia (myelomonocytic neoplasia/lymphosarcoma)
62,152,242,251
a.Multiple mononeuropathies of cranial nerves, most commonly involving the mandibular branch
of CN V bilaterally,have becn associated with mononuclear cell neoplasia in dogs.Myclomono
cytic neoplasia is a rare malignant form of cancer that has been reported to involve cranial and
peripheral nerves, as well as the CNS in a limited number of dogs. Infltrative nodules of neo-
plastic myelomonocytic cells are found in cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, and ganglia, as well as
multiple organ systems.Multicentric lymphosarcoma is a common form of cancer that has been
reported to cause a similar clinical picture in dogs, either via direct neoplastic infiltration of
cranial nerves, or as a paraneoplastic phenomenon.
b.'The hallmark of the few reported cases has been multiple cranial nerve dysfunction, especially
bilateral dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve. Other cranial nerves have also been affected.
Clinical signs of cranial ncrve dysfunction have included masticatory muscle atrophy, inability to
close the jaw, decreased facial sensation, decreased swallowing reflex, and unilatcral or bilateral
Horner's syndrome. The author has encountered sevcral cases of cranial nerve dysfunction in
dogs withmulticentric lymphosarcoma.Bilateral dysfunction of CN Vwith a dropped jaw has
been the most consistent clinical abnormality.However,one dog exhibited unilateral facial nerve
(CN VII) dysfunction in addition to bilateral CN Vdysfunction.Another dog exhibited unilat-
eral CN VII dysfunction as the only neurologic deficit.
C. Antemortem diagnosis is based upon signalment, historical and clinical findings, and results of
diagnostic tests that suggest or confirm the presence of neoplasia. These dogs may have blood
work evidence suggesting malignancy elsewhere, such as leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocyto-
penia.Thoracicradiographs andabdominal ultrasoundmayreveal solidmassesin cases of
lymphosarcoma. Needle aspirates of such solid masses may yield a diagnosis in such cases.
Neoplastic cells may also be identified in lymph node and bone marrow aspirates. Electrodiag-
nostic evaluation (e.g., EMG) and muscle biopsy may confirm neurogenic atrophy of masticatory
muscles. CSF evaluation may be abnormal (e.g., lymphocytic pleocytosis in lymphosarcoma
patients).
d. Therapy for these neuropathies is targeted toward the underlying neoplasia. Although various
chemotherapy protocols arc available, the prognosis for long-term survival is guarded to poor.
E.Infammatory/infectious,autoimmune
a.1
 Brachial plexus neuritis/neuropathy is a rare multiple mononeuropathy reported in dogs and one
cat. The pathogenesis is unknown, but there is evidence to support this disease as being an
allergic reaction to some immunogen, similar to the analogous disorder in people. Associations
between such potential precipitating immunogens as dietary horse meat and modifed-live rabies
vaccines have been made in the few reported veterinary cases. Axonal and myelin loss are mainly
confined to ventral branches of the spinal nerves that make up the brachial plexus. Bilateral
brachial plexus neuritis, with diffuse enlargement of the spinal nerves in this area seen on MR
imaging, has been reported in a cat. An immune-mediared ctiology was suspected in rhis case as
well.
b. The typical clinical scenario is a patient with acute onset of bilateral LMN paresis or plegia
involving the thoracic limbs. Neurogenic atrophy of thoracic limb muscle is also characteristic.
One reported dog also had evidence of unilateral facial paresis.
C.A tentative diagnosis is bascd upon historical (e.g, history of exposure to a possible immunogen)
and clinical findings. Electrodiagnostic testing and muscle/nerve biopsies should also support the
diagnosis. Computed tomography or MR imaging may confirm nerve pathology.
14/DISORDERSOFTHEPERIPHERALNERVOUSSYSTEM
447
d.Due to its rarity, little is known about the prognosis of this disorder. In the few cases reported,
recovery appears to be prolonged. A prolonged recovery time is typical in the human form of this
disease, probably due to the proximal nature of the axonal injury. There is no known specific
treatiment for this disorder, bur glucocorticoid therapy and diets devoid of beef and horse meat
(e.g., poultry based) have been suggested.
2. Optic eurits2628.106,201,23040.25
a.
 Optic neuritis refers to infammation of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and/or optic tracts and
exists cither alone as an idiopathic (presumably immune-mediated) form or as one manifestation
of a more widespread infarnmatory/infectious (e.g., granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis
[GME],canine distemper,tick-borne encephalitis virus infection,ehrlichiosis,fungal discase,
protozoal disease, feline infectious peritonitis) or neoplastic (e.g., lymphosarcoma meningioma)
disorder. The pathogencsis of idiopathic optic neuritis is unknown.
b. Optic neuritis may occur in both dogs and cats (less common) of both sexes at any age (usually
adults). The characteristic clinical findings are acute blindness (usually bilateral), with dilated
pupils that are unresponsive to light. Ophthalmoscopic abnormalities (e.g., swollen optic disk)
may or may not be evident, depending upon the location of the lesion with respect to the
fundus. A normal electroretinogram (ERG) is supporive of optic neuritis rather than retinal
optic neuritis is not a primary idiopathic condition.
C.
Diagnosis is based upon historical and clinical findings, ERG results, and tests for possible
underlying disorders (e.g., CSF analysis, fungal titers).
d. Treatment depends upon. the underlying disorder. If infectious and neoplastic processes are ruled
out, treatment usually consists of immunosuppressive prednisone therapy (1 mg/kg per os, q
12 hr) for 2 weeks (longer if GME is suspected), with subsequent gradual tapering of the dose.
Early institution of immunosuppressive therapy is important for a favorable prognosis in idio-
 pathic optic neuritis. Prognosis for return of vision is guarded.
8
a.An idiopathic inflammatory disorder primarily involving both axons and myelin of ventral nerve
roots occurs in dogs and is probably the most common polyneuropathy in this specics.Although
much less common, an analogous polyneuropathy has been described in cats. This disease is very
similar to Guillain-Barre syndrome in human beings. Varying degrees of axonal and myelin loss
in motor nerves explain the characteristic clinical signs. Although most cases of Guillain-Barre
syndrome of people are associated with widespread demyelination,there is evidence that axonal
loss is more prominent than demyelination in most dogs with polyradiculoneuritis. Demyelin-
ation is thought to be most sevcre in the ventral nerve roots in dogs, with minimal myelin loss in
the major nerve trunks.
Although the pathogenesis is uncertain, an autoimmune process is suspected. The term
coonhound paralysis refers to those dogs with a history of bcing bitten or scratched by a raccoon
shortly before developing clinical signs of disease. Thc term idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis refers
to patients with an identical clinical disorder, but with no possible exposure to raccoons. These
two subcategories probably reflect the same disease syndrome, with the trigger for the inflamma-
tory process being as yetunidentifed in the latter subcategory In humans, Guillain-Barre
syndrome is most comrmonly temporally associated with gastrointestinal Campylobacter jejuni
infections. The proposed etiology in these cases is the production of autoantibodies against
axolemmal components, which, in turn, stimulate immune axonal attack. Antibody production is
nerve gangliosides (located on human peripheral nerve surface membranes).
b. The typical clinical scenario for acute idiopathic polyradiculoncuritis describes a rapidly develop-
ing LMN paresis/plegia, usually beginning in the pelvic limbs and eventually involving the
8
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
rhoracic limbs. Most affected animals will progress to being either nonambulatory tetraparetic or
tetraplegic within 10 days of initial onset of clinical signs. It is not uncommon for this stage of
dysfunction to be reached within a 72-hour period of time. The development of life-threatening
respiratory paralysis is a concern, especially in the morc rapidly developing cases. Loss or change
of voice (dysphonia, aphonia) is comnon, and some paticnts will also exhibit facial weakness.
Spinal reflexes are typically absent (with the cxception of thc perincal reflex, which is normal),
muscles are hypotonic, and neurogenic atrophy develops quickly in recumbent patients. Proprio-
ceptive placing reactions will be normal in those animals that still have cnough motor ability to
perform the efferent limb of these tests. These patients retain the ability to urinatc and defecate
and willreadily cat and drink if the head is supported. Pain sensation also remains intact. In fact,
thcsc animals often seem hypercstbetic upon limb manipulation, which may reflect the inflam-
matory nature of the discase.
In dogs with coonhound paralysis, there is a history of an cncounter with a raccoon approxi-
mately 1-2 weeks prior to the onset of clinical signs. In patienrs with idiopathic polyradiculo-
neuritis, identical clinical features are prcsent as described, with no possibility of a raccoon
scratch or bite.
C.
Diagnosis is typically based upon the signalment (usually a miature hunting-brecd dog in coon-
hound paralysis), history (c.g., cxposure to a raccoon), and characteristic clinical signs of a
rapidly progressive polyncuropathy. Other potential causes of polyneuropathy should be ruled
neuropathy. It is important to realize that many, if not rmost, of these dogs will exhibit abnormal
EMG activity with normal motor nerve conduction velocities (MNCV). Considering that
MNCV primarily reflects myelin integrity rather than the number of funclional axons in a
peripheral nerve, this phenomenon should not bc confusing. The patients often do not have
enough functional axons to ambulare, but the remaining axons have cssentially normal myelina-
tion. A specific type of nerve conduction velocity test (F wave) that evaluates the vcntral nerve
roots is often abnormal in dogs with polyradiculoneuritis. Cerebrospinal fuid examination may
demonstrate increascd protein levels.
d. There is no specifc therapy for this disease. Glucocorticoids have been suggested, but there is no
evidence of efficacy. Nursing care, physical therapy, and proper nutrition are essential for recov-
ery. Humans with Guillain-Barre syndrome recover more rapidly when treated with plasma
exchange or human immunoglobulins intravenously within 4 weeks of disease onset. However,
this treatment modality is frequently unavailable or cost-prohibitive in veterinary setings. The
inflammatory phase of chis disorder is believed to bc transitory, but the damaged axons need to
is typically prolonged, usuall taking scvcral weeks to several months. Somc patients develop life-
threatening respiratory paresis/paralysis in the acute phase of the diseasc (usually those dogs
whosc signs progress rapidly ovcr 72 hours) and may need to be mechanically ventilated. Re.
cxposure to raccoons is to bc avoided in dogs having recovered fron coonhound paralysis, as this
may trigger a relapse of the disease.
a.Rarely reported forms of polyradiculoneuritis in dogs and cats include chronic polyradiculoneuri-
tis, chronic relapsing polyradiculoneuritis, and cauda quina polyradiculoneuriis.The etiology
and pathogenesis of thiese rare disorders are unknown, but the presence of inflammatory infil-
trates in the nerve roots and nervcs is a consistent feature.
b. In chronic or chronic relapsing polyradiculoneuritis, there is a slowly progressive (over wecks to
months) polyncuropathy that may ot may not include cranial nerve dysfunction and may or may
not include sensory (proprioception, nociception) dysfunction, Muscle wasting is also.a variable
finding. Some patienrs will have either transient or sustained remissions of clinical signs that may
 or may not seem related to corticosteroid administration. Partial remission of clinical signs may

paraneoplastic) of a neuropathy.

5. Chronic infammatory demyelinating polyncuropathy/chronic relapsing
a.  Chronic inflamnatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a suspected autoimmune
polyncuropathy of mature dogs and cars (mean age of 6-7 years) chat has rccently bccn
described. An analogous neuropathy occurs in people. This disorder is believed to be one of the
more common neuropathies in dogs and cats. A polyneuropathy very similar to CIDP, referred
to as chronic relapsing polyneuropathy, has bcen described in cats.
b. Clinical signs of insidiously progressive LMN paresis, with abnormal proprioception and normal
sensation, have been described in CIDP and chronic relapsing polyncuropathy. The course of the
disease is typically chronic, and patients tend to spontaneously recover and relapse. Clinical signs
ofdysfunction often occur in the pelvic limbs initially, then progress to involve he thoracic
limbs. The spectrum of potential clinical signs of dysfunction is broad and may include
depressed spinal refexes, muscle atrophy, paraparesis, tetraparesis, and tetraplegia.
C. Diagnosis is based upon historical and clinical features consistent with the disease in conjunction
The predominant pathologic feature seen in nerve biopsies from these patients is evidence of
demyelination and remyelination. Inflammatory cells have consistently been identified in ultra-
structural studies of nerve biopsics from CIDP patients. Evidence of infammation was lacking in
nerve biopsies from paticnts with chronic relapsing polyneuropathy. Axonal degeneration is not a
feature of CiDP, but was evident on nerve biopsy of one cat with chronic relapsing
polyneuropathy
d. ithe prognosis is guarcded to good. Most animals with CIDP and chronic relapsing polyneuropa-
thy tend to be responsive to glucocorticoid therapy. In a recent report, 90% of dogs and 88% of
cats with CIDP exhibited an initial positive response to oral prednisone therapy (12 mg/kg
body weight, every 12 hours). Patients may relapse coincident with reduction of glucocorticoid
dosagc or discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy. Some aninals that initially respond to
glucocorticoid therapy may subsequently become resistant to such treatment. If a positive
response to glucocorticoid therapy is demonstrated in a patient with suspected CIDP or chronic
relapsing polyncuropathy, dose reduction should proceed slowly once renission of clinical signs is
achieved.
6.Protozoal olyradiculoneuritis6,283067,74893
a.Both Toxoplasma gondi and Neospora caninum procluce a severe polyradiculoneuritis in puppics,
* : usually along withi some degree of accompanying meningoencephalomyelitis and myositis.
b. Both organisms typically cause a polyracliculoneuritis in puppies less than 3 months of age that is
most profound in the humbosacral nerve roots, cspecially venrral roots. The puppies typically
experience an acute paraparesis with rigid pclvic limb extension. Patcllar and withdrawal reflexes
are lost, and musclc wasting in the pclvic limbs develops. The patients retain nociceptive ability
and often have pain over the back and upon pelvic limb manipulation. Some dogs have a morc
fulminating course, with rapidly developing tetraparesis/tetraplegia and respiratory failurc. Therc
is evidence to suggest that N. caninum may be the more common offending organism in fulmi-
nating cases. Since many peripheral and cranial nerves can be affected, and concurrent infection
of the brain, spinal cord, and muscles is often present, evidence of a multifocal disease process
may be apparent. Although less common, adult dogs have been affected by these organisms.

C.The diagnosis is confirmcd by identifying the organism's prcsence cither serologically (antibody
assays) and/or histopathologically (biopsy or necropsy specimens) in a patient with typical
clinical signs of protozoal polyradiculoneuritis. Electrodiagnostic tests will be confirmative of a
neuropathy, myopathy, or both.

dorsal root ganglia and dorsal nerve roots, as wellas sensory cranial nerve ganglia. 'The pathogen-
esis of this nonsuppurative process is unknown, bur viral and immune-mediated causes have been
proposed.
b.Mature dogs are typically affected, and the Siberian Husky breed may be overreprescnted.
Clinical signs may develop acutely or insidiously and are progressive over one to several months.
The majority of clinical signs reported reflect dysfunction of sensory systems. These clinical signs
decreased to absent spinal reflexes, hypermetric gait, decreased or altered (e.g., paresthesia/
dysesthesia)facial sensation,dysphagia,megaesophagus,head tilt,Horner's syndrome,hearing
loss, altered voice,and selfmutilatin.Some dogs will alsohavemasticatory muscle atrophyhis
latter feature has been attibuted to secondary damage of motor axons of the trigeminal nerve as
they traverse through the inflamed trigeminal ganglion.
C.There is no treatment for this disorder, and glucocorticoid therapy may even cause a worsening
of clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis is made at necropsy (histopathologic findings). A tentative
diagnosis is based mainly upon signalment, history, and supportive clinical findings. Electrodiag-
nostic tests and muscle/nerve biopsies may or may not support the diagnosis. CSF analysis may
be normal, or may have mild elevations of cells and/or protein levels.
d.The prognosis for recovery is poor.
a. An idiopathic, bilateral, nonsuppurative infammation of all motor branches of CN V (princi-
pally demyelination with some axonal loss) has been reported in both dogs (primarily) and cats.
'T'he pathogenesis is unknown, but an etiology is suspected.
b.The typical clinical picture is acute onset of jaw paralysis, with inability to close thc jaw (Fig.
14.7). This occurs most commonly in adult (often older) animals. Most patients retain the ability
to swallow, but mild dysphagia is occasionally observed. Unilateral Horner's syndrome has also
been reported, presumably due to involvement of the postganglionic sympathetic fibers that
travel with the ophthalmic branch of CN V. Facial sensation is normal in the majority of cases;
however, unilateral orbilateral facial sensory deficits are possible.There is one case report of a
young dog with purely sensory trigeminal neuropathy of unknown etiology. A variable degree of
neurogenic atrophy of the masticatory muscles may develop. Although a dropped jaw is charac-
teristic, trismus has been obscived in some cases.
C.A tentative diagnosis is bascd upon the typical clinical fcatures of the disease. Electromyography
and muscle biopsy results will support the diagnosis but are often not pursued. Magnctic reso-
nance imaging may also be used to differentiate trigeminal neuritis from a MNST of the trigemi-
nal nerve, particularly in dogs with unilateral nerve involvement. Other diseases that may affect
the trigeminal nerves and/or masticatory muscles should be ruled out. In particular, multiple
cranial nerve mononeuropathy due to mononuclear cell neoplasia (lymphosarcoma,myelomono
cytic cancer) should be considered as a differential diagnosis, especially if clinical signs do not
resolve within several weeks. Obtaining a vaccination history is important, as rabies can present

with a similar clinical picture (i.e., dropped jaw). In masticatory myositis (see Chapter 15),
trismus is the typical presentation rather than a dropped jaw.
d.This is a self-limiting disease, and most patients recover fully within 2-3 weeks. Glucocorticoid
therapy has been advocated earlyin the course of the disease,but thereis little evidence of
efficacy. Although glucocorticoid treatment of dogs with trigeminal neuritis is not contraindi-
cated, such therapy may diminish subsequent responsiveness to combination chemotherapy in
dogs whose trigeminal nerve dysfunction is due to mononuclear cell neoplasia. Some patients
may have to be hand fed or fed through a pharyngostomy, esophagostomy, or gastrostomy tubc
(i.e., those patients with dysphagia) during recovery.
a.A rarely reported hyperactivity of the facial nerve in dogs and cats, hemifacial spasm probably
reflects a secondary irritation of the facial nuclcus and/or nerve.Potential diseases that could
cause irritation include otitis media (facial nerve) orbrain stem disease (facial nucleus and/or
nerve) such as neoplasia, or infectious/inflammatory disorders (e.g., GME).
b. The affected patient typically has an asymmetric facial countenance, with the nose and lips
pulled toward the affected side. A small palpebral fssure with blepharospasm and a slightly
elevated ear may also be appreciated on the affected side.
C.
Diagnosis is based upon clinical signs. This syndrome may be confused with secondary facial
muscle contracture due to prior facial nerve paralysis. The treatment and prognosis depend upon
the underlying cause of the hyperirritability.
F.Ischemic
Ischemic neuromyopathy is an ischemic insult due to vascular occlusion of the arterial supply to
the limbs by an embolus. Both pelvic limbs are typically affected. This is usually reported in cats in
association with cardiomyopathy, but has also been reported in dogs with a variety of underlying
disorders.The vascular occlusion and resultant inflammatory mediators (which impair collateral
452

circulation) result in damage to both peripheral nerves and musclcs of the affected limbs. This
disorder is discussed in more detail in Chapter 15.
333.338
1. Traumaric neuropathies are common in dogs and cats and most often are a result of automobile
accidents. Some of these neuropathies may be associated with fractures. Sciatic nerve injury occurs
occasionally with pelvic fracture/luxations, especially sacroiliac luxations, sacral wing, caudal acetabu-
lar, and ischial fractures. The sciatic nerve may be injured at the time of trauma or may be progres-
sively compressed during the bone-healing process by proliferating connective rissue. Sciatic nerve
cntrapmcnt by osrcophytes associated with hip dysplasia has been reported in the dog, but is consid-
ered a rare phenomenon. Radial nerve injury may occur with humeral fractures, but it is cxtremely
uncommon.
Extremiry injuries may be complicated by osteofascial compartment syndrome or reflex sympa
thetic dystrophy, infrequent trauma-related phenoimena that involve peripheral nerves. Osteofascial
compartment syndrome occurs when hemorrhage and/or edema accumulate within a closed space
whose borders are imade up of skeletal muscle fascia or bone (osteofascial compartment). If the
resultant pressure rise within the comparrment is of suffcient magnitude and duration, damage to
both muscle and nerve within that compartment may occur. Refex sympathetic dystrophy is a
poorly understood phenomenon, usually associated with cxtremity rrauma, in which the affected
limb becomes very painfudl and exhibits various autonomic abnormalities (e.g., edema, increase or
decrcasc in teniperature, sweating). This syndrome typically occurs weeks after the traumatic event in
people and is thought to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Reflex sympathetic
dystrophy has been reported in the dog.
Most traumatic neuropathies are traction injuries, with no evidence of orthopedic problems
(e.g, brachial plexus avulsion). Brachial plexus injury is commonly encountered in dogs and cats and
is thoughr to be caused by severe abduction and/or traction of the thoracic limb. These injuries nay
be partial or complete. Avulsion of the nerve roots appears to be a common form of brachial plexus
injury, perhaps due to the lack of a perineurium over the ncrve roots. The avulsions are typically
intradural, in close proximity to the spinal cord. Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome and lack of a curane-
ous trunci reffex often accompany brachial plcxus avulsions, because of damagc to the T1.-T3 and
C8--T1 roots, rcspectively. Other causes of traumatic neuropathies include missile injuries (e.g.,
gunshot wounds), bite wounds, and iatrogenic causes (e.g, inadvertent surgical trauma, injection
injuries to the sciaric nerve). Iatrogenic injury is most common folowing pelvic surgerics, including
Osteotomies. Entrapment of the sciatic nerve during forward-positioning of the hind limbs for
perineal surgery has also been reported.
arc as follows:
a. Class 1 (neurapraxia): Class I refcrs to a transient lack of nerve fiunction, with litc or no
structural damage to the axons or their supportive connective tissue structures. This tcmporary
dysfunction may be due to ischemia (no structural damage) and/or mild paranodal demyelin-
ation. The degree of motor and proprioceptive dysfunction is variable, but nociceptive function
is preserved for the most part (large-diameter axons are preferentially affected). Sponraneous
recovery is expected within days to a month, depending upon the degree of demyelination.
Neurogenic muscle atrophy is unlikely, as the axons are structurally intact.
b. Class 2 (axonotmesis): In a class 2 type of injury, some or all of the axons of the nerve are
disrupted strucurally, but the connecive tissue support (e.g, chwann cel basal lamina, ndo-
neurium) rermains intact. These axons can regrow along the connective tissue scaffold. Substantial
motor, proprioceptive, and nociceptive dysfunction is cxpcctcd with this type of injury, the

used both for localizing purposes and for providing prognostic information in some peripheral nerve
injuries. These tests should be performed a minimum of 5-7 days after injury because severed nerves
will still conduct impulscs and denervated musclc may still be electrically silent prior to this timc
period. Magnetic resonance imaging may also be helpful in early recognition of nerve injury and

repair of a fracture causing secondary nerve trauma, corrctive tendon transposition or joint fusion
in partial brachial plexus injuries) in which accurate estimation of the location and severity of nerve
trauma may assist in choosing what therapeutic course should be taken. Successful repair of injured
peroneal and tibial nerves with cutaneous saphenous nerve grafts has been reported in a dog. Grafted
nerve segments should be similar in width to the injured nerve(s). Experimental evidence of regen-
eration of chronically denervated peripheral nerves using transplanted neural stem cells has been
described.
27 dogs with iatrogenic injury of this nerve, only 13 patients recovered fully with treatmcnt. Clinical
nerve transplantation. The prognosis for most brachial plexus injuries is poor for functional return of
the limb. The majority of brachial plexus injuries are compiete avulsions. The second most common
scenario is damage to the caudal area of the plexus, including the contribution to the radial nerve.
Cranial plexus injuries, which carry the most favorable prognosis (preservation of weight-bearing
function), are rarely encountered. There is no chance of improvement with nerve root avulsion, but
there may be improvement if the roots are still intact. It may be diffcult or impossible to tell in
many cases whether or not the nerve injury is permanent. In one report of 30 brachial plexus
injuries, only eight dogs achieved functional limb recovery 4 months or more following the injury.
Preservation or return of triceps function is a favorable prognostic indicator for brachial plexus
injuries. In general, the lack of deep pain perception to the toes is a poor prognostic indicator.
Physical therapy for the affected thoracic limb and waiting sevcral months for some return to
function are indicated before considering amputation. However, if self-mutilation due to paresthesia/
dysesthesia or severely infected abrasions (due to dragging the foot without adequate protective
covering) develop within that time period, amputation may be indicated at an earlier date. The
location of a class 2 or class 3 injury may also affect the prognosis. Axons regrow at a rate of 1-
4 mm per day. In people, muscle motor end-plate degeneration may occur if the damaged nerve does
not reestablish contact with the muscle within 18 months.So, with a very proximal injury, the
prognosis may be poor, even if axonal regeneration occurs.Despite the unfavorable outlook for
functional return with most brachial plexus injuries, most dogs and cats function extremely well with
three legs.
H. Toxic
1. Thalliumn poisoning26,2,5,9,30,327,349,350
a.The heavy metal thallium is found in rodenticide preparations currently banned from use.
Although the incidence is now quite low, dogs and cats will still occasionally ingest thallium-
poisoned rodents and develop signs of toxicity.
b.In addition to gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cutaneous signs of toxicity, neurologic dysfunc-
tion may be observed with thallium ingestion. Since thallium affects both the CNS and PNS, it
may be difficult to discern which clinical signs are due to a peripheral nerve damage and which
are due to brain or spinal cord dysfunction. Clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction with
thallium toxicity can include seizures, dementia,hyperesthesia, tremors, ataxic gait, and parapare-
sis or paraplegia.
C.The tentative diagnosis of thallium toxicity is based upon a history of possible exposure in a
patient with signs of toxicity. Finding thallium in the paticnt's urine confrms the diagnosis.
d.If ingestion is known to have occurred within an 8-hour time period, the treatment is induction
of vomiting and administering activated charcoal. After this time period, the treatment consists
of oral Prussian blue and potassium chloride as well as supportive care.The prognosis is
guarded.
a.Massive doses of vitamin Bg can cause a sensory neuropathy in dogs.
456
b.Clinical signs of toxicity include ataxia (especially in the pelvic limbs), dysmetria, and decreased
conscious proprioception. T'here is usually no evidence of paresis.
C.
Diagnosis is based upon characteristic clinical signs in a patient receiving megadoses of
pyridoxine.
d.Treatment is discontinuation of pyridoxine supplementation. The prognosis for resolution of the
sensory deficits is unknown.
 3. Vincristine neuropathy26.28.58.96.137,304
a.This alkaloid antineoplastic agent commonly causes neuropathies in humans and has been shown
both experimentally and clinically to cause neuropathies in dogs and cats. The suspected mecha-
nism is impairment of axonal transport due to breakdown of neurotubules.
b. Clinical signs include varying degrees of motor and sensory deficits to the limbs. Experimentally,
cats develop a LMN paraplegia. A recent report of a dog with vincristine neurotoxicity described
an ataxic gait with decreased proprioception and spinal reflexes in the pelvic limbs.
C.Diagnosis is based on clinical signs of a neuropathy in a patient receiving vincristine and confir-
matory results of electrodiagnostic tests and muscle/nerve biopsies. Resolution of the neuropathy
after vincristine discontinuation is important in order to distinguish vincristine as the cause of
the disorder rather than a paraneoplastic neuropathy.
d.Treatment is discontinuation of vincristine administration.The neuropathy will likely resolve
with time.
4. Delayed organophosphate toxicity in cats26,28,46,58,168,202,2i2,276,304
a.A polyneuropathy associated with prolonged exposure to chlorpyrifos has been described in cats.
The mechanism by which the organophosphate causes the neuropathy is unknown.
b.The reported cats exhibited varying degrees of decreased thoracic and pelvic limb proprioception,
decreased spinal refexes, generalizedhyperesthesia, and paraparesis. Bilaterally dilated pupils
(partially responsive to light)were alsoreported.
.Diagnosis in the reported cases was based upon history (exposure to organophosphates),
C.
decreased serum cholinesterase activity, neurologic examination findings, and an abnormal EMG.
d.Treatment consisted of intravcnous pralidoxime (2-PAM) and subcutaneous atropine.The cats
recoveredcompletely
a.An unusual neuropathy involving the peroneal and tibial nerves of one pelvic limb has been
described in unweaned Walker Hound puppies. There was degeneration of both axons and
myelin in the peroneal and tibial nerves. The cause is undetermined,but a toxic agent in well
water used to prepare milk replacement is suspected.
b. Clinical signs occurred at approximately 2 weeks of age and included paresis, lack of propriocep-
tion, absent spinal reflexes, muscle atrophy, and analgesia (except on the medial aspect of the
limb), allin one pelvic limb. Progressive signs of worsening paresis as well as self-mutilation of
the affected limb occurred over a 6-week period.
C.Diagnosis is based upon history, signalment, clinical findings, and results of histopathologic
cvaluation. All of the reported puppies were euthanizcd due to the progressive nature of the disease.
6. Salinomycin toxicity in cats58.96.317,332334
a. In the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, a severe polyneuropathy has been reported in cats
that had eaten food contaminated with the chicken jonophore coccidiostat, salinomycin.
b. An acute, progressive polyneuropathy occurred in affcted cats. Clinical signs of neurologic
dysfunction included paraparesis, tetraparesis, dysphagia, dyspnea, and generalized muscle
atrophy. Paralysis of the pelvic limbs characteristically developed initially, followed by paralysis of
the thoracic limbs.
C.Diagnosis was based on clinical signs consistent with a polyneuropathy in cats exposed to food
contaminated with salinomycin. Evidence of a distal axonopathy affecting both motor and
scnsory nerves was evident on histopathologic evaluation of nerve samples.
14/ DISORDERSOF THEPERIPHERALNERVOUSSYSTEM
457
d. Many of the earliest reported cascs were cuthanized due to disease severiry. However, removal of
contaminated food and provision of supportive therapy is likely to lead to a full neurologic
recovery in the majority of affected cats.

MYOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF SKELETAL MUSCLE

skeletal muscle dysfunction include weakness with preservation of sensory function (e.g, nociceprion,
proprioceprion), muscle atrophy, and muscle pain or myalgia. In some diseases, muscle hypertrophy is
present rather than atrophy. Also, myalgia is not a feature of some myopathies.
Skeleral muscle is composcd of multinucleated cells termed myofibers, which are arranged in bundles
called fascicles. Each myofiber is innervated by an axonal process of a motor neuron at a specialized area of
the sarcolcmma (muscle cell plasma rnembrane) called the cnd platc (scc Chapter I6). The myofihers
contain thc contractile apparatus, which comprises interlocking myoflaments (actin, myosin, troponin,
tropomyosin). Musclc contraction occurs when calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (the
myofiber endoplasmic rcticulum) following sodium infux into the myofiber (depolarization). Adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) is required for coordinared contraction and relaxation of the muscle fiber. A muscle
enzyme called creatine kinase (CK) is required to immediately replenish ATP from adenosine diphosphate
(ADP) by cleaving a high-energy phosphate group from the compound phosphocreatine, also found in the
myofiber.
There are two main types of myofbers, differentiated upon the extent of histochernical staining with
AT'Pase (muscle biopsy samples). Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers (relatively high levels of oxidative
cnzymes and lipid, low glycogen content), and type II fibers are fast-twitch fibers (relatively high levels of
glycogen, lesser amounts of oxidative enzymes and lipid). A uniquely staining fiber type, called type IM,
is found only in masticatory musclc. One motor neuron will innervate a number of myofibers within a
fascicle, and the fiber type of those myofibers will all be the same. The motor neuron and the myofbers it
innervates are called a motor unit. The motor unit's myofiber type is dictated by the motor neurons. The
myofbers of a single motor unit are normally scatrered through a fascicle, giving a checkerboard appearanice
to the stained biopsy sample,
In some cases, it will be diffcult to discern a myopathy from a neuropathy or neuromuscular junction
disorder. Diagnosis of myopathies is based upon the neurologic examination findings as well as specific
diagnostic tests. Typical diagnostic tests to pursue when a myopathy is suspecred include serum CK mca-
surement (elevations suggest muscle danage) anid electrodiagnostics (remember that electromyograpby
[EMG] abuormalitics can be seen with neuropathies and myopathies). However, these rests may yield
abnorimal resuls for rcasons unrelated to neuromuscular disease. In particular, CK levels rnay be elevated in
alorexic cats. Historical information, examination findings, and a decrease in CK levels with nutritional
support may be used to help differentiate this elevation from that seen in neuromuscular disease. Muscle
and/or nerve biopsies can be very helpful in elucidating the cause of a peripheral nervous system disorder. In
addition to the A'TPase stain, there is a large number of histochcmical stains that can be applicd to sections
of a single muscle biopsy to help characterize the nature of the muscle disorder. The specifics of these stains
are beyond the scopc of this text. A surmmary of myopathies of dogs and cars is shown in Table 15.1.

The term muscular dystropby (MD) is often loosely applicd, referring to a wide varicty of inher-
ited myopathies. In this text, this term will be used to describe those conditions associated with
deficient or abnormal myofiber cytoskeletal proteins. This disorder is usually associated with
either reduced levels or complete lack of a subsarcolemmal protein called dystropbin.Dystrophin
is thought to have an important structural role for myofibers and may also serve a vital role in
cellular homeostasis, possibly as a regulator of intracelular calciur transport. A number of
dystrophin-associated proteins (eg, sarcoglycans, dystroglycans), as well as laminins (basement
membrane proteins),may also be deficient in some forms of MD.
An X-linked inherited trait, belicved to be the veterinary analog of Duchenne's and Becker's
muscular dystrophy of huinans (dystrophin deficiency), has been described in various dog breeds
(Golden Retriever, Rottweiler, German Shorthaired Pointer, Irish Terrier, Samoyed, Belgian
Groenendaeler Shepherd,Miniature Schnauzer,Rat Terrier,Wire-haired Fox Terrier, Brittany
Spaniel,Japanese Spitz,Weimaraner, Labrador Retriever, Old English Sheepdog, Grand Basset
Griffon Vendeen, Corgi) and cats (domestic shorthair, Siamese,Maine Coon).Specific genetic

mutations have been defined in Golden Retrievers, German Short-Haired Pointers, and Rottwei-
lers. Progressive muscle atrophy predominates in dogs (although some muscle groups tend to
hypertrophy), whereas muscle hypertrophy is the hallmark of MD in cats. The pathologic change
in affected muscle is characterized histologically by variation in myofiber size (including both
degenerating and regenerating myofibers), with necrosis and mineralization of myofibers.
b.This disease is best described in the Golden Retriever. Clinical signs of partial trismus and a
bunny-hopping gait may be appreciated as carly as 6 weeks of age in male puppies. Although
carriers of dystrophin mutations often show elevations in their serum CK levels,without signif-
cant clinical disease. In affected dogs, signs typically progress over 36 months, after which time
the disease often stabilizes. Common clinical signs include progressive muscle atrophy of the
limbs, head, and trunk, exercise intolerance, a stilted gait, plantigrade stance (with associated
tarsal joint contracture), excessive salivation (pharyngeal dysfunction), weak bark (dysphonia),
kyphosis that progresses to lordosis, and hypertrophy of the muscles of the base of the tongue.
Proximal limb muscles, particularly the cranial sartorius muscle, may undergo hypertrophy in
somc dogs. Dysphagia and exercise-induced myalgia may present as sole clinical findings initially
before the onset of generalized weakness. Hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux can be seen
clinically, secondary to diaphragmatic and esophageal dystrophy,respectively.Spinal refexes are
normal initially but may become decreased due to muscle fbrosis. Inhalation pneumonia from
pharyngeal/esophageal dysfunction and heart failure due to cardiomyopathy have also been
reported. Uncommonly, some puppies display a morc fulminant form of MD and die within
10daysofbirth.
There appears to be considerable variation in time of disease onset and severity of clinical
signs in cats with MD. Although affected cats may exhibit characteristic signs, such as a bunny-
hopping pelvic limb gait in the first months of life, they may also have mild or inapparent
clinical signs of myopathy until approximately 2 years of age. Progressive stiffness in gait and
muscle hypertrophy are prominent features of MD in cats, in contrast to the weakness and
atrophy characteristic of the canine disorder. Stress may induce open-mouthed breathing and/or
syncopal episodes in cats with MD, presumably due to a cormbination of cardiac and respiratory
muscle involvemenr. A form of MD associated with laminin alpha 2 deficiency (normal dystro.
phin) has been described in two young female cats (Siamese and domestic shorthair). These cats
exhibited progressive muscle atrophy and weakness, beginning in the pelvic limbs, at approxi-
mately 5-6 months of age. Spinal reflexes were depressed to absent. Both cats progressed to
nonambulatory status over 6-12 months.
C.
Diagnosis of muscular dystrophy is based upon signalment, characteristic clinical findings,
marked serum CK elevations (often over 10,000 U/l), bizarre high-frequency discharges on
electromyography, and muscle biopsy results (myofiber degeneration/regeneration with mineral-
ization). Overall, the degree of elevation of CK in affected dogs does not correlate to the severity
of their clinical signs. Serum CK levels in female dogs with MD have been less-dramatically
elevated compared with most males with the disorder. Cats with dystrophin-deficient MD
frequently show myotonic discharges and fibrillation potentials on electromyographic evaluation,
particularly in the proximal appendicular muscles.Motor nerve conduction studies remain
normal. A lack or absence of dystrophin can be demonstrated immunocytochemically on a
muscle biopsy specimen or by Western blot analysis. Occasionally, dystrophin-associated proteins
and laminins may also be deficient, with or without obvious lack of muscle dystrophin. Muscles
of affected Golden Retrievers undergo fibrosis earlier than in other affected breeds, a process that
appears tobe cytokine driven.
Golden Retrievers with muscular dystrophy may show consistent abnormalities on thoracic
and pelvic radiographs. Diaphragmatic asymmetry, with an undulating pattern and cithcr left

A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
crural fattening or ventral displacement, may be seen on thoracic radiographs, and can be
accompanied by a hiatal hernia. Characteristic pelvic radiographic abnorimalities include narrow-
ing of the body of the ilia, ventral deviation of the tuber ischii, clongation of the obturator
foramina, and lateral elongation of the wings of the ilia. Thc pclvis is overall tilted vertically,
narrowed, and elongated. These pelvic changes may be secondary to myopathy-induced contrac-
tures resulting in bone remodeling and appear to be specific to the form of muscular dystrophy
seen in Golden Retrievers. Cats with muscular dystrophy may develop marked diaphragmatic
hypcrtrophy, with megaesophagus seen secondary to esophageal stricture.
d. There is no definitivc trcatment for muscular dystrophy. Some patients may have an unexplained
positive response when treated with glucocorticoids. Golden Retrievers with this disorder treated
with daily prednisone therapy experience a combination of functional improvement, but histo-
pathologic dererioration. Growth hormone has been used clinically in human patients to decrease
the severity of Duchenne MD. Additionally, lower insulin-like growth factor-1 concentrations
(used as a measure of growth hormone) have been rclatcd to more severe forns of MD in
Golden Retriever dogs. However, supplementation of growth hormone in such dogs has not yet
nary studies have shown improvements in mobility and muscle function in dystrophic dogs using
multiple gene therapy protocols. Pharmacologic up-regulation of utrophin production (a paralog
of dystrophin) shows promisc as a potential treatment for Duchenne MD and possibly the
canine analog of this disorder (Golden Retriever MD). However, continued research is needed
before such treatments become available for clinical usc. Stem cell therapy for dogs and humars

a。
'T'his autosomal recessively inherited trait has been reported in black and yellow Labrador
Retrievers of both sexes and is thought to be similar to limb-girdle MD of pcople. The disorder
is unknown, but therc is cvidence that an elevated intramyofiber sodium/potassium ratio in rhese
dogs may be involved in the observed muscle weakncss (i.c., due to an abnormally positive
resting membrane potential). A correlation to a centronuclcar-like myopathy with autosomal
recessive inheritance, reported in a colony of Labrador Retrievers, has been proposed.
A syndrome of exercise intolcrance and collapse during intense cxcrcise is also seen in young
adult Labrador Retrievers. The pathophysiology of this disorder is poorly understood. Affecrcd
dogs do not show cardiovascular, orthopedic, or neurologic abnormalities. Hyperthcrmia and
clevated plasma lacrate lcvels are commonly seen at the onset of collapse, although an elevation
in body temperature of up to 3° Celsius may be found in normal dogs of this breed following
intensive exercise. Additionaly, affected dogs show a change in their lactate/pyruvate ratio,
whereas this should not be seen in norimal dogs.
b. The age of onset as well as the severity and range of clinical signs are variable. The age of onset
of clinical signs may range berween 6 weeks and 7 months, but most dogs manifest obvious
clinical signs of disease at about 3-4 months of age. A short, stilted gait with bunny-hopping in
the pelvic limbs is often observed. Some dogs display ventrofexion of the neck and arching of
the back (kyphosis; Fig. 15.1). Abnormal joint posture, such as carpal hyperextension and valgus,
splaying of the digits, and a "cow-hocked" pelvic limb stance, may aiso be apparent. 'Tendon
refexes arc usually reduced or abscnt (especially patellar and triceps refexes). This unusual
clinical observation has led to speculation of a neuropathic component to this disorder. Alterna-
tively, the deprcsscd reflex activity may reflect involvement of intrafusal muscles (muscle spindlcs
jnvolved in generation of the spinal reffex arc). Variablc degrees of muscle atrophy, especially of
the proximal limbs and head, develop as the diseasc progresses. Epaxial (paraspinal) muscularure

may also become atrophied. Weakness is often exacerbated by stress, excitement, exercise, and
cold weather. A few dogs with this disorder have developed megaesophagus. The condition
typically stabilizes by 6-12 months of age.
 Diagnosis is based upon signalment, clinical fndings, and results of electrodiagnostic testing and

muscle biopsy. Creatine kinase levels are usually normal to only slightly elevated. Electromyogra-
phy findings are frequently abnormal, and muscle biopsy findings often exhibit a mix of types I
d.There is no treatment for this disorder, although some dogs will improve with oral diazepam
therapy. In general, dogs with this myopathy are only mildly disabled, so the patient's life span is
often normal. Exposure to cold and stressful environments should be avoided.
3. Distal myopathy of Rottweilers80,130.23,26
a.A presumably inherited myopathic disorder that preferentially involves distal appendicular
muscles was described in four young Rottweiler dogs. Two of the four dogs were siblings, and
one of the remaining two dogs evaluated had two reportedly similarly affected siblings (not
evaluated clinically). The etiology of this disease is unknown. Distal myopathy of Rottweilers
appears to be similar to distal myopathy of pcople, a broad category of autosomally inherited
myopathies thatprimarily affect distal appendicular muscles.
b.The age at which the dogs were evaluated was between 4 and 7 months, but all dogs had
clinical signs of dysfunction include a palmigrade and plantigrade stance (Fig. 15.2), splayed
digits in the forelimbs (Fig. 15.3), generalized weakness, and exercise intolerance.
c.Diagnosis is based primarily on signalment,characteristic clinical features,and abnormal
muscle biopsy histopathology results. Creatine kinase levels were normal in one dog and only
mildly elevated in the two others in which it was measured. Electromyography was performed in
two of the four dogs. In one dog, rare fibrillation and positive sharp waves were identified. No
EMG abnormalities were identified in the other dog. Both dogs had decreased amplitude of
interosseus compound muscle action potentials, elicited during motor nerve conduction velocity
testing. Plasma carnitine levels were decreased in all four dogs. Muscle carnitine levels were
below normal levels in three dogs and in the low-normal range in the remaining dog.

Dystrophin immunocytochemical staining was normal in the two dogs for which this test was
performed.
d.At present, the prognosis for this myopathy appears to be poor. All four dogs were euthanized,
three due to the severity of the disease and one due to an unrelated behavioral disorder. This
latter dog's clinical signs appeared to improve somewhat with oral carnitine supplementation, but
did not deteriorate after carnitine withdrawal. The clinical significance of low plasma and muscle
carnitine levcls in this disorder is unknown, but it is felt to be a secondary rather than causative
phenomenon. The potential eficacy/inefficacy of carnitine supplementation for this myopathy
remainstobedetermined.
a.This disorder is believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in Chow Chow dogs and
Miniature Schnauzers. Other breeds reported with a similar condition include the Staffordshire
Terrier,Rhodesian Ridgeback,Great Dane,West Highland White Terrier, Samoyed Cross,
Australian Cattle Dog, and Labrador Retriever. Myotonia congenita has also been described in
six domestic short-haired kittens. The four kittens in one report were from separate litters, but
the queens of those litters were related. The discerning clinical feature of this disorder is sus-

tained muscle contraction after cessation of voluntary movement. Failure of muscle relaxation is
believed to be due to abnormal sarcolemmal chloride conductance. The decreased chloride
conductance leads to hyperexcitability of the muscle membrane. Subsequent accumulation of
initial depolarization.Abnormal sarcolemmal chloride channels,due to an autosomally inherited
genctic defect, have been demonstrated as the cause of myotonia congenita in the Miniature
Schnauzer. There are several forms of myotonia congenita in humans, some of which are due to
abnormal sodium conductance across the sarcolemma.
b. Clinical signs are usually appreciated when affected puppies and kittens begin to ambulate.
Affected animals typically appear worse after a period of rest. Cold temperatures also tend to
cause exacerbation of clinical signs. The gait is stiff and tends to improve or even normalize with
activity. The pelvic limbs are often more severely affected than the thoracic limbs; in canine
myotonia, they may be advanced simultaneously in a bunny-hopping fashion. It may be difficult
for affected dogs tofex the stife joints.The thoracic limbs are often held abducted while
ambulating, due to decreased ability to fex the proximal limb joints. Myotonic patients may
have difficulty rising from a sternal position. Myotonic kittens tend to snag their claws when
walking on carpet. When myotonic kittens are startled, they may hypcrextend all four limbs and
fall into lateral recumbency for approximately 10 seconds. Startling of these kittens may also
result in bilateral prolapse of the nictitans, blepharospasm (due to spasm of the orbicularis oculi
muscles),fattening of the ears, and retraction of the lips.
tongue in dogs, gastrocnemius muscles most prominent in cats) is often appreciated, and per-
cussing the muscle may leave an indentation, referred to as a myotonic dimple (Fig. 15.4). Some
patients will exhibit dysphagia and respiratory problems (e.g., stridor) because of sustained
contraction of pharyngeal and laryngeal musculature, respectively. Affected kittens may exhibit
signs of dysphonia, characterized by a hoarse meow and quiet purr. Unusual physical characteris-
tics apparent in all of a group of related myotonic Schnauzers were prognathism (shortened
mandible) and medially displaced canine teeth.

C. Diagnosis is based upon signalment, characteristic clinical signs, and electrodiagnostic fndings
(EMG abnormalities). Creatine kinase levels are often either normal or only mildly elevated, and
changes on muscle biopsy are usually mild and nonspecific (eg., variation in myofber size).
Muscle biopsy results may contribute to the diagnosis, but may not be worth thc risk of ancsthe-
sia in these patients. Anesthesia may be both difficult and dangerous due to stenosis of thc
lalyngeal glottis. Also, people with myotonia are predisposed to anesthetic-induced malignanl
and wane. These discharges are frequently referred to as “dive-homber sounds,” due to their
waxing and waning nature. Others have likencd their sound to a motorcycle engine. Myotonic
this brecd. Lastly, polymerase chain reaction-based DNA tests have recently bcen reported fot
scrcening Australian Cattle Dogs and Miniature Schnauzers for myotonia congenita.
d. There is some evidencc that using membrane-stabilizing agents may be helpful in relieving
clinical signs in myotonic dogs. Procainamide is thought to be more effective than phenytoin or
quinidine. Other drugs that have been used to treat myotonia in dogs include carbamazepine,
tocainide, nifedipine, and mexiletine hydrochloride. Environmental modification alone is recom-
mended to control clinical signs in myotonic cats. These kittens tend to be well managed
without drug therapy, and drugs typically used to control canine myotonia have unacceptable
toxicity risks in cats. Myotonia congenita is not considered a progressive disease, and clinical
signs of dysfunction tend to stabilize bctween 6-12 months of age. In gencral, most dogs and.
cats with myotonia congenita are not severely disabled, and therefore the prognosis for long-term
survival is favorable. The prognosis for sustained improvement of clinical signs of myotonia is
guarded,howcver.
a.This is an idiopathic disorder characterized by replacement of muscle tissue with dense fibrous
connective tissue. It occurs most commonly in dogs, cspcially adult male German Shepherd
dogs (approximately 81% of reported cases). Other brceds reported with fibrotic myopathy
include Belgian Shepherd, Boxer, Old English Sheepdog, Doberman Pinscher, Saint Bernard, and
Bobtail. It has been reported in onc cat. The gracilis muscle is most oftcn affected (86% of
cases), but the semitendinosus muscle may also be affected, either alone or concurrently Involve-
ment of the supraspinatus and quadriceps muscles has been reported, bur this is rare. The fibrotic
gracilis/semitendinosus muscle produces a tethering effecr, interfering with coxofemoral joint
myopathy, neuropathy, isolated muscle trauma, repeated microtrauma, and vascular compromise
have all been suggested as possible eriologies.
b. Age of onset of dysfunction ranges from 8 months to 9 years (mean, 5 years). Clinical signs are
usually limited to apparently non-painful pelvic limb lameness, which is more obvious at a trot
than at a walk. In most cascs, the lameness has an insidious onset and progresses over weeks to
months before reaching a plateau. Occasionally, acute onset of lameness is reported. Bilateral
involvement occurs in approximately 26% of cases. When both pelvic limbs are affected, the
degree of dysfunction may not be symmetric; also, one limb may be affected initially, the other
becoming dysfunctional at a later date. Although classically considered a non-painful disorder,
One study found that a painful response could bc elicited from the majority of affected dogs with
hip abduction and/or digital pressure applicd to the distal aspcct of the fibrotic muscle. The
fibrous muscle prevents full extension of thc pelvic limb during ambulation. The lameness in the
affected limb is characterized by internal roration of the stifle and extcrnal rotation of the hock as
the limb is advanced (Fig. 15.5). The foot performs a “flipping” motion at the cnd of each stide.
The resultant gait is often describcd as “jerky” or “goose stepping.” Affected muscle tissue may be

Diagnosis is based primarily upon signalment and characteristic clinical findings. Increased
 thickness may be appreciated in affected muscles with both radiographs and ultrasonography.
Creatine kinase values are typically normal or slightly elevated. Electromyography often fails to
record any abnormal electrical activity. There are reports of both increased EMG activity
and lack of normal insertional activity. Muscle biopsy reveals dense collagenous connective
tissue.

A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
d.Medical therapies for fibrotic myopathy (e.g, corticosteroids, penicillamine, colchicine) have
been ineffective. Various surgical procedures (e.g., tenotomy, Z-plasty, excision of affected
muscie) have met wicth poor long-term success. After surgery, improvement in gait is often
substantial but transient, lasting only a few months. If the abnormal gait is not severely lmiting
the patient's lifestyle, no treatiment is recommcnded.
a. Nemaline myopathy is a rare, presumably inheried disorder described in young rclated cats.
Congenital nemalinc myopathy has also been reported in two dogs, a 10-month-old Border
Collie and an I l-ycar-old Schipperke. Nenaline rods were also observed in muscle biopsy
thy. Finally, nemaline rods have been reported as incidenal fndings in muscle biopsies of dogs
specific for nemaline myopathy.
A diagnosis of nemaline myopathy should be suspected when there arc numcrous ncmaline
rods present in thc absencc of any other cause for a myopathy. The pathogenesis of nemaline
sions within myofibers (nemaline rods). In human nemaline myopathy, these rods have been
shown to be composed of cytoskeletal proteins identical to those found in the Z-band area of the
contractile filament apparatus. A myofiber cytoskeletal protein abnormality is suspected. Accu-
mulations of tubulin-positive crystalline inclusions and dystrophin and spectrin proteins, in
adldition to nemaline rods, have been reported in cats as well. A myofibrillar myopathy showing
accuinulationis of alpha-actin (Z-disk material) and desmin within the myofiber has been
reported in an Australian Shepherd dog.
h. The reported cats had an acute onset of clinical signs between 6 and 18 months of age. Clinical
signs included weakness, a rapid and crouched hypermetric gait, muscle tremors, hyporefexia,
muscle atrophy, and reluctance to move. Only the muscle atrophy appeared to be progressive.
Both congenital canine nemaline myopathy cases had slowly progresive clinical signs that
included exercise intolerance and reluctance to stand and walk. The Border Collie displayed
tremors in allimbs, muscle atrophy, and absence of patellar refexes. Additional clinical signs of
dysfunction in the Schipperke included a stiff gait, spontaneous limb jerking, and decreased
withdrawal reflexes in allfour limbs. 'The endocrinc myopathy cases had clinical signs of dysfunc.
tion typical for their respective myopathic disorders.
C. Diagnosis is based upon signalment, clinical signs, and demonstration of ncmaline rods on
muscle biopsy samplcs. Creatine kinase levels were only mildly elevated in the reported cats
and EMG evaluation was normal. Similarly, the CK level of une of the congenital caninc cases
was normal, the other slightly elevated. Electromyography changes in these two dogs were
mild.
d.Although only the muscle atrophy was progressive, the reported cats cantinued to lose condition
and hecame inappetent. All the cats werc eventually euthanized. Thc disorder in the reported
dogs was slowly progressive ovcr sevcral years. There is no known trearmcnt for nemaline myopa-
thy, and the prognosis for rccovery is poor.
a.Inherited myopathy is an infrequently reported myopathy seen in young Great Danes within the
United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia. It is likely inherited as an autosomal
recessive trait and is characterized by core-like structures seen in skeletal muscle biopsies. The
pathophysiology of this disorder is not fully determined, but ultrastructural analysis of these
central core-like structures has demonstrated focal accunulations of rmitochondria and glycogen,
along with disrupted myofibrilar elements. These findings are limited to skeleral muscles.
Similarity to human central core disease has bccen proposed, although pathologic findings differ
between the two disorders.

b. The time of onset of clinical signs in Great Danes with this disorder has ranged from 6 months
to 3 years in age in reported cases, although the majority prcscnt as older puppies (median age of
7 months). Clinical signs may initially be mild and are ofteu slowly progrcssivc. Thcsc can
include generalized muscle weakness that worsens with exercise, progressive muscular afrophy, a
short-strided gait, bunny-hopping, and remors while standing. Depressed spinal reflexes have
been reported in a small subset of affccted dogs.
C.
Diagnosis is primarily based on signalment, coinpatible clinical signs, and finding characteristic
sharply defined, basophilic inclusions localized within the center of muscle fibers (central cores)
levels. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartatc aminotransferase (AST) levels were
also frequently found. Electromyography has frcquently been abnormal (fbrillation potentials,
positive sharp waves).
d. No'specifc trcatment is available. Thc majority of affected Great Danes appear to progress in
time of 4 months in onc report). However, a subset of dogs with milder manifestations of the
disease has been described, having a median survival time of 27 months (range of 10-55
months).
8.Dancing Doberman disease
Dancing Doberman disease is a recently described idiopathic syndrome in adult Doberman
Pinschers that has characteristics of both a neuropathy and a myopathy. It is discussed in more detail
in Chapter 14.
a. Myositis ossficans is a rare idiopathic disorder of dogs and cats in which prolifcration of fbro-
vascular tissue within muscle occurs, with secondary calcification and ossification. Jntermuscular
mineralization has also been reported. It is not known if this disease represents a primary muscle
disorder or if this is an abnormality of connective tissue adjacent to muscle (e.g., tendons, fascia)
that leads to a secondary myopathy. Calcinosis circuinscripta within lingual muscle has also been
reported, secondary to a nutritional myopathy and idiopathic calcinosis.
b.This disorder typically affects young adult to middle-aged animals of both sexes. Clinical signs
include progressive weakness and stiffness of gait, enlargement of proximal limb muscles, and
myalgia. Focal, firm swellings may be evident on musclc palpation.
C. Diagnosis is based primarily upon signalment, clinical signs, and radiographic evidencc
of mincralized/ossifed densities (usually multiple) within muscle tissue. Creatine kinase
levels are typicaly elevated, and EMG cvaluation reveals abnormal potentials. Histopathologi-
cally, brosis, myofber necrosis, phagocytosis, and areas of calcification/ssfication may
be seen.
d. Since this tends to be a progressive disease, the prognosis is considered guarded to poor.
However, focal lesions may regress or respond favorably to surgical excision.
10. Pharyngeal/esophageal dysfunction of Bouviers4,239
a.A myopathy primarily affecting pharyngeal and esophageal musculature has been described in 24
Bouvicr des Flandres dogs from the Nethcrlands. The pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown,
but muscle histopathology revealed abnormalities similar to those observed in dystrophin-related
muscular dystrophy (DRMD). It has been suggested that this disorder may be the canine analog
of oculopharyngeal MD of people. Although suspected to be a heritable trait, the mode of
transmission is unknown. Four adult female Bouviers with generalized muscle weakness and
megaesophagus were described in the United States. These dogs also had histopathologic changes
on muscle biopsies consistent with DRMD. It is unknowni wherher these dogs had a variation of
the same disorder as the group in the Netherlands.
b. Both males and females were affected, with an age range of presentation from 6 months to 9
480
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
with dysphagia also exhibited rcgurgitation. Regurgitation was the predominant clinical feature
in 3 dogs.
C.Tentative diagnosis of this myopathy was based upon historical and clinical signs, as well as
abnormal pharyngeal and esophageal movement on fuoroscopic examination. Only 7 dogs had
radiographically obvious air accumulation in the csophagus. In 20 dogs in which serum CK
levels were evaluated, 7 dogs had normal values, and CK levels were clevated in 13 dogs. Electro-
myography abnormalities of the pharyngcal and/or esophageal musculaturc wcre found in all but
rcvealed changes characteristic of DRMD. In 2 dogs, these characteristic abnormalities were also
apparent in temporalis, massctcr, and laryngeal musculature.
d. There is no known effective treatment for this disorder. Four dogs with dysphagia underwent
cricopharyngeal myotomy. One of these dogs improved, but the other 3 died of aspiration
pneumonia within 2 days of surgery. The majority of the affected dogs were euthanized due to
11., Polysystemic disorder of English Springer Spaniels3
a. Three related young English Springer Spaniels havc bccn described with the combination of
polymyopathy, dyserythropoiesis, and cardiac abnormalities, Thc ctiology of this polysystemic
disorder is unknown, but it is suspected to be a heritable variant of MD.
b.All three dogs developed clinical signs of dysfunction within the frst 6 months of life, and all
were considered small for their age. One dog occasionally regurgitated, and thc other two had
dccreased gag rcfexes. Slowly progressive temporal muscle atrophy developed in all dogs, with
subsequent partial trismus. To a lesser degree, pelvic limb muscle atrophy occurred over time.
One dog exhibited a stiff gait,most notable in the pelvic limbs, often bunny-hopping when
ambulating. Exercise intolerance was not a notable featurc in any of the three dogs.
c.Diagnosis of this disorder was based upon both antemortem and necropsy evidence of concur-
rent polymyopathy, dyserythropoietic aneimia (erythrocytcs with abnormal norphology, including
blast forms), and various cardiac abnormalities (e.g., right ventricular enlargement, enlargement
of conus arteriosus, ascending aorta enlargemcnt, ventricular prcmature complexes). Varying
degrees of megaesophagus and abnormal esophageal motility were evident on thoracic radio-
graphs and fuoroscopic evaluation, respectively. Serun CK levels were normal in one dog and
slightly clevated in anothcr. Electromyography abnormalities were nor evident in the one dog in
which electrodiagnostics were pursued. Abnormal muscle pathology in affected dogs included
marked fiber size variation and fiber splirting.
d.There is no known effcive therapy for this disorder, and the prognosis for recovery is poor. All
three dogs were euthanized.
a. This is an uncommon and enigmatic disorder of young dogs. It is characterized by failure of
rclaxation of the muscle during the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing. The underlying reason
for the lack of cricopharyngcus relaxation is unknown. Suggested etiologies include myopathy,
neuropathy (affecring glossopharyngeal nerve and pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve), junc-
tionopathy, and central nervous system (CNS; brain stem) lesion. Cricopharyngeal achalasia
associated with hypothyroidism has been reported in one dog. A full recovery was seen following
thyroid hormone supplementation, suggesting a possible role of hypothyroidism in the develop-
ment of cricopharyngeal achalasia in this case.
b. Numerous dog breeds have been reported with cricopharyngeal achalasia. Spaniel breeds appear
to be overrepresented in the literature; there is one report of cricopharyngeal achalasia occurring
in Cocker Spaniel littermates. Clinical signs of dysfunction arc usually evident at the time of
weaning and rernain static, unless aspiration pneumonia develops. Dysphagia is the hallnark
clinical sign of dysfunction. Other characteristic clinical signs include regurgitation (typically
inmediately following attempted swallowing): nasal reflux. of ingcstcd food, coughing, and either

weight loss or failure to gain weight.Dogs with this disorder may be more able to swallow
liquids than solids, but ingesting liquids may lead to more nasal reflux than solids.
C.The diagnosis of cricopharyngeal achalasia is based primarily upon history, signalment, and
characteristic clinical features, as well as ruling out other causes of dysphagia and regurgitation
(e.g., idiopathic megaesophagus, myasthenia gravis, vascular ring anomalies).Radiographs of the
pharyngeal area and thorax should be obtained to rule out pharyngeal foreign bodies and mega-
esophagus, respectively. Also, the presence or absence of aspiration pneumonia can be ascertained
by thoracic radiographs. Crucial to diagnosis is evaluation of swallowing using contrast fuoros-
copy (Fig. 15.7). This radiographic evaluation should confirm failure of cricopharyngeal relax-
ation during the swallowing reflex.Endoscopic evaluation of the pharyngeal area will be normal,
and there is typically no appreciable impediment to passing the scope through the pharyngeal
region.

aspiration pncumonia and/or malnutrition preoperatively in animals with cricopharyngeal
achalasia frequently worsens postoperative outcome.
a.This uncommon disorder, reported most frequently in the Scottish Terrier breed ("Scotty
cramp"), is characterized by episodic muscle hypertonicity. The episodes are of variable frequency
and severity and are induced by stress, exercise, and excitement. The disease appears to be
inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in Scottish Terriers. Although the pathogenesis is not
completely understood, clinical manifestations of this disorder appear to be due to a functional
deficiency of serotonin in the CNS. Drugs that potentiate CNS serotonergic effects (e.g.
acepromazine) alleviate clinical signs, whereas those that decrease CNS serotonergic effects (e.g,
amphetamine) cither worsen or induce clinical signs. A similar, if not identical, condition has
been described in Dalmatians, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and Norwich Terriers. In the
report concerning the affected Dalmatians, a similar condition was mentioned in a Cocker
Spaniel and a Wire-Haired Terrier. A similar episodic muscle hypertonicity syndrome, called
neuromyotonia, has been reported in several breeds and is discussed in the Myokymia and Neuro-
myotonia section below. It has been suggested that this group of disorders may represent a form
of dyskinesia (see Chapter 7). Lastly, true muscle cramps have been reported in Standard Poodles,
associated with hypoadrenocorticism.
b.The majority of affected dogs initially exhibit clinical signs of dysfunction within the first year of
life, usually between 2 and 6 months of age. An age range of 6 weeks to 3 years has been
two affected Dalmatians were 4 and 8 months old. Affected dogs are normal between episodes.
Episodes of muscle cramping are usually clicited by exercise but can also be associated with other
forms of stress or excitation.The extent of muscle hypertonicity may vary from primarily pelvic
limb involvement to severe hyperflexion of all limbs with subsequent collapse. Pelvic limb
hypertonicity is typically noticed first during an episode. Affected dogs often exhibit exaggerated
Hexion action of the pelvic limbs, referred to occasionally as a string-balt or goose-stepping gait.
Some dogs will advance the pelvic limbs simultaneously in a bunny-hopping fashion. If signs
progress, the lumbar spine may become arched and the thoracic limbs may become abducted,
and subsequently hyperHexed. Severely affected dogs may collapse due to the extent of muscle
hypertonicity. Crossing of the thoracic limbs over the top of the head has been described in
collapsing Cavalier King Charles Spanicls.
The episodes are not painful, and there is no alteration of consciousness. They can last.from
less than a minute to several hours, but they typically last for approximately 10 minutes. Recov-
ery is often hastened with rest or removal of the inciting stressful stimulus. Hypertonic episodes
C.Diagnosis of this disorder is based on the following: (1) typical signalment, historical, and
clinical features; (2) abiliry to induce a hypertonic episode with intramuscular amphetamine
(0.5-2.0 mg/kg IM) or with exercise 2 hours after administration of methylsergide (0.3 mg/kg,
orally), a serotonin antagonist; and (3) ability to cause remission of a hypertonic episode with
diazepam (0.5-1 mg/kg IV), acepromazine (0.075-0.1 mg/kg IM), or chlorpromazine (1.0-
1.75 mg/kg IM). Basic blood work and CK values are normal, as arc EMG studies. Muscle
biopsy results are also generally normal. In one report on Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, fairly
nonspecific ultrastructural muscle fiber abnormalities were described, but were of questionable
clinical significance.

d.Treatment for episodic muscle hypertonicity in Scottish Terriers is typically either with oral
diazepam or an oral promazine drug (e.g, acepromazine), Cavalier King Charles Spaniels tend to
be less responsive to diazepam than other breeds with the condition, but they can markedly
inprove with clonazepam treatment. Tolerance to cloniazepam may develop in the long term.
 Other therapies reported to decrease frequency and severity of episodes include vitamin E and
tryptophan. This is a nonprogressive disorder that tends to improve with therapy. Life spans of
affected dogs do not appear to be shortened by the diseasc.
a. This category of disease (especially myokymia) is often discussed with tremor and moverment
disorders, but it is probably more accurarcly categorized as a neuropathy (sce Chapter 14). It is
discussed in this chapter because the manifestations of the disorder appear clinically to be more
like a myopathy than a ncuropathy. The underlying pathophysiological cause for the intermittent
and excessive muscle contraction characteristic of myokymia/neuromyotonia is thought to be
hyperexcitabiliry of motor axons; in hunans, this hyperexcitability is thought to be due to
abnormalities of volrage-gated potassium channcls (VGKC) in thesc nerves, which is often due to
heritablc disorders of these ion channels; for example, the disorder known as episodic ataxia with
myokymia is due to a point mutation in the VGKC
gene (KNA1). Whether acquired (autoim-
une) or inherited, the VGKCs involved in this disorder are fast potassium channels, also
referred to as delayed rectifier channels, whose function is necessary for cessation of depolarization
as well as repolarization of the axon. If these channels are dysfunctional and/or decreased in
density, prolongation of depolarization will allow more calcium to enter (calcium channels will
remain open), with subsequent excessive release of acetylcholine transmitter quanta into the
synapric cleft. This, along with delayed repolarization, will lead to excessive and repetitive muscle
contraction. Confusion regarding this clinical phenomenon is likely perpctuated both by an
unnecessary number of descriptive terms and the vast array of primary disorders that can. lead to
the manifestarion of this type of muscular activity. The terms myokymia and neuromyotonia
probably refer to thc same class of disorders, differing solely in the frequency (in H-lertz) of the
episodic involuntary muscle fiher contraction that characterizes the disease syndrome. The term
myokyrmia, which is derived from the Greek word kyma (which means wave), is probably the
most descriptive term for the vermicular (worm-like), rippling, or undulating motion of the skin
(most notably on the proximal limbs) caused by the spontaneous intermittent contraction of
subcutaneous musculature. Myokymic discharges are characteristically bursts of single motor unit
action potentials that have a frequency of 5-150 Hz. Neuromyotonic discharges are described as
similar episodic discharges of higher frequency (150-300 Hlz, often with a waning amplitude),
which are believed to be more likely than myokymic discharges to culminate in generalized
contractions of large muscle groups (e.g., limh musculature). These intcrmittent bursts of motor
unit action potentials occur as doublets, triplcts, or multiplets on EMG examination and sound
(over the loudspeaker) like soldiers marching. These muscle fiber discharges persist during sleep
likely refer to different stages of scverity of the same clinical condition. According to soine
sources, rnyokymia is considered a clinical manifestation of the overall disease syndrome of
neuromyotonia. In other words, the umbrella term for thc disorder is neuromyotonia, which
includes the phenoimenon of myokymia. Since thc majority of reported cases in thc veterinary
litcrature describe patients that displayed myokymia and then rapidly progrcssed to gencralized
muscle contraction and collapse, this is probably the correct use of the terminology. In addition
to these rerms, neurormyokynia, continuous muscle fiber activity (CMFA), continuous motor unit
activity (CMUA),neurotonia,pseudomyotonia,andepisodicnonpostural repetitive myoclonus have
been proposed. The list of disordcrs in people that have beenn associated with concurent myoky-

mia and neuromyotonia is extensive and includes several autoimmune or suspected autoimmune
disorders.It includes caudal fossa tumors, Guillain-Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis, radiation
induced plexopathy, timber rattlesnake envenomation, chronic infammatory demyelination
polyneuropathy (CIDP), thymoma, lymphoma, plasmacytoma, small-cell lung carcinoma,
Hahimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and acquired myasthenia gravis.
The disorder has also been associated with penicillamine treatment. In addition to the multitude
of terms already mentioned,the terms Isaacs syndrome,Mertens syndrome,Isaac-Mertens
syndrome, and Morvan's syndrome (also includes signs of encephalopathy) all refer to myokymia/
neuromyotonia due to autoimmune response against VGKCs.
b. Myokymia and neuromyotonia have been reported in eight dogs and one cat. The dogs included
three Jack Russell Terriers, two Yorkshire Terriers, a Border Collie, a Cocker Spanicl, and a
mixed-breed dog. The one feline report was a 6-year-old domestic shorthaired cat, With the
exception of one dog with facial myokymia (6-month-old Cocker Spaniel, age at onset of 4
months) who had occasional involvement of the left shoulder musculature, all of the other
reported cases exhibited neuromyotonia with more generalized muscle stiffness, in addition to
myokymia. Of the neuromyotonia cases, the cat was the least severely affected, remaining
ambulatory despite the involuntary muscle contractions.With the exception of one Border Collie
with an age at onset of 2 years, the other dogs with ncuromyotonia had a very young age at
onset of disease (2-1l months). These dogs all had a similar clinical presentation in which the
excessive muscular contraction culminated in collapse. In all cases, the dogs were fully conscious
during the collapsing episodes. The episodes in these dogs were typically triggered by stress,
excitement, or exercise and lasted for several minutes to several hours. Between episodes, the dogs
returned to normal, or their pre-episode condition (see comments below on the Jack Russell
Terriers). Episodes were heralded in three dogs by intense facial rubbing, similar to what has
bcen reported in hypocalcemic dogs. Common to all of these reported cases of myokymia/
neuromyotonia was moderate to severe hyperthermia during the episodes.In two cases, death
during an episode was attributed to hyperthermia.Another common feature was persistence of
spontaneous muscle contraction during sleep and general anesthesia. All three rcported Jack
Russell Terriers exhibited generalized ataxia in addition to the myokymia/neuromyotonia
episodes. Whether this finding represents concurrent hereditary ataxia or a condition similar
to human episodic ataxia with myokymia is unknown. Two of the Jack Russell Terricrs also
exhibited mild cyanosis during episodes.
C.As with humans with myokymia/neuromyotonia, the diagnosis rests primarily on characteristic
clinical features of the disease along with demonstrating the characteristic EMG abnormalities
(i.c.,episodic bursts of spontaneous muscle activity of specific frequencies). Other characteristic
supportive features include serum elevations of ALT,AST, and CK concentrations.Muscle/nerve
biopsy results in people may be normal or indicative of axonal degeneration and/or demyelin-
Russell Terriers had evidence of axonal degeneration and demyelination of peripheral nerves, with
very mild muscle changes. One Yorkshire Terrier had normal muscle biopsy results. The cat had
evidence of myofiber necrosis and regeneration, and intramuscular nerve branches were normal.
Although none of the veterinary cases had an obvious underlying disorder for which the myoky-
mia/neuromyotonia was considered a secondary or associated phenomenon, this should be
addressed in such cases, based on what is known in the human literature on the subject. Unlike
the scenario in human medicine, there is no assay for circulating anti-VGKC antibodies for dogs
orcats(to diagnose autoimmune causesformyokymia/neuromyotonia) andno canine orfeline
hereditary mutations for the VGKC gene have been identified.
d.A variety of drugs have bccn effective in treating human myokymia/neuromyotonia, including
procainamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine, acetazolamide, mexiletene, and gabapentin.These
drugs have membrane-stabilizing properties and may also be of some benefit for vererinary cases
15 / MYOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF SKELETAL MUSCLE
485
of myokymia/neuromyotonia. In people with underlying autoimmune disorders, immunosup-
pressive drugs are used in addition to membrane-stabilizing agents. The cat responded favorably
to oral phenytoin, and one Yorkshire Terrier responded well to procainamide, Two other dogs
had transient responses to such therapy. The Border Collie responded for several months to oral
mexiletene and then reverted to the previous frequency of episodes. One Jack Russell Terrier
responded to oral procainamide, but died during an episode in the second month of treatrnent.
(two dogs), suggesting at least a guarded prognosis for this disorder. However, more experience
with this disease, especially with treatment options recommended for people with the disorder
(only one of the deceased dogs was treated with one of these drug options), will be necessary
before an accurate estimate for prognosis can be formulated for myokymia/ncuromyoronia in
dogs and.cats.
B.Metabolic
a.A rclarively cornmon myopathy associated with low cxtracellular porassium levels is encountered
in cats. Most of these cats have chronic renal dysfunction with subscqucnt potassium loss
through the urine. Other conditions associated with hypokalemic myopathy in cats include
hyperthyroidism, dierary porassium deficicncy, hyperaldosteronism, fuid overadministration,
chronic vomiting/diarrhca, and overuse of potassium-wasting diuretics. There is also a suspected
hereditary condition of unknown pathogenesis in Burmese kittens with periodic hypokalemia
and signs of myopathy. This condition is suspected to be inherited as an aurosomal recessive
trait. It may be similar to hypokalemic periodic paralysis of people. Hypokalemia leads to
hyperpolarization of the sarcolemma resting membrane potential, making it refractory to
depolarization and subsequent contraction.
b. Most cats with this conidition are older and have evidence of renal dysfunction. The Burmese
ambulate, and a stiff, stilted gait. With severe hypokalemia, respiratory paralysis and rhabdomy-
olysis can occur.
C. Diagnosis is based upon signalment, historical and clinical findings, as well as supportive evi
dence of a myopathy in a cat with hypolkalemia. The potassium level in affected cats is less than
3.5 mEq/l, and often is less than 3.0 mEq/l. Creatine kinase levels are usually moderately to
markedly elevated. Elecrromyographic evaluation typically reveals abnormal activity such as
fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and bizarre high-frequency potentials. Muscle biopsy
samples ofien reveal no or very mild abnormralities. Resolution of clinical signs with potassium
supplementation also supports the diagnosis.
d.Trcatment of this condition is oral potassium gluconatc at an initial dose of 5-8 mEq/kg/day,
therapy. Maintenance therapy of 2.-4 mEq/day is usually sufficient after achicving normal scrurn
potassium levels. Potassium administration via intravenous fluids is usually counterproductive,
because the dilutional and diuretic aspects of Huid administration actually further lower the
potassium level.
In life-threatening hypokalemia, concentrated intravenous potassiun solutions can be
administered at a rate of 0.4 mEq/kg/hr. However, this is potentially dangerous and can lead to
fatal cardiac arrhyihmias without close monitoring of the scrum potassium level and the clectro-
cardiogram. An alternative is a dopamine infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/min. This may cause a transient
incrcase in serum potassium and allow timc for oral potassium supplemcntation. The prognosis
for this condition with proper therapy is generally favorable. Most cats exhibit obvious
486
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
improvement within 1-3 days of potassium supplementation, although complete rccovery may
takeseveralweeks.
a.Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is an uncommon autosomal dominant genetic disease in
people that has been reported in one dog. The clinical hallmark of HIPP is episodic faccid
muscle weakness, which often leads to transient (usually less than 1 hour) paralysis. The episodes
are typically induced by exercise and exposure to cold environmental temperatures. Part of the
clinical definition of HPP is cxacerbation of clinical signs following oral potassium adininistra-
tion. The physiologic mechanisms involved in this disorder are not well understood, but they arc
thought to involve either excessive release of potassium from the myofiber across the sarcolemma
and/or increased passive motion of sodium across the sarcolemma into the sarcoplasm. Abnormal
glucose metabolism has also been implicated as a contributor to fluctuating serum potassium
levels in patients with HPP. The weakness is thought to be due to inuscle release of potassium
ions, rather than a response of muscle to high serum levels of potassium. Although episodes are
typically associated with elevated serum potassium levels,this is not always demonstrable. Also,
the elevated serum potassium levels are increased as compared to pre-collapse levels, but they are
often still within the norrmal range.
collapsing approximately once a day, usually coincident with playing. Weakness typically began
with the pelvic limbs and would quickly progress to involve the thoracic limbs. The dog's neck
became limp,her tongue would protrude, and she would collapse.The episodes lasted approxi-
mately 10-15 seconds.After 3 months, the episodes had increased in frequency to several times a
day. There was no impairment of consciousness during the episodes.
C.1
Diagnosis of HPP is supported primarily by demonstrating an exacerbation of clinical signs
following oral potassum administration, as well as a positive response to therapy. Sustained
elevation of serum potassium levels associated with collapsing episodes also supports a diagnosis
of HPP There may or may not be EMG abnormalities in HIPP patients, and CK levels are
typically normal to slightly elevated. Muscle biopsy results are normal in HPP. In the reported
dog, a few fibrillation potentials were documented in the lumbar musculature, and the CK was
slightly elevated at one time, normal at another. A muscle biopsy revealed no abnormalities.
A sustained elevation of serum potassium was demonstrated after a brief period of exercise,
although this level remained within reference range. The dog experienced marked worsening of
clinical signs following oral potassium administration on two separate occasions.
d.Treatment with acetazolamide in people with HPP is very effective, usually leading to cessation of
collapsing episodes within 24 hours of treatment initiation.Acetazolamide is thought to stimulate
release ofboth insulin and glucagon,which subsequently promotes themovement of potassiumions
into muscle cells. Other therapies reportedly used in human HPP include mineralocorticoids,
salbutamol, and thiazide drugs.There is some evidence that glucocorticoids may worsen collapse
was treated with oral acetazolamide and no further collapsing episodes ocurred.
a.Excessive circulating glucocorticoid levels, whether due to endogenous production or exogenous
administration of glucocorticoids, can lead to a myopathy in dogs and cats. The physiologic
mechanism or mechanisms behind the development of the myopathy is not fully understood.
There is some evidence that elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels may interfere with muscle fber
mitochondrial function. Additionally, a diminished muscular Na*, K*-ATPase concentration has
been demonstrated in dogs with pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH). This is
believed to contribute to muscular weakness seen in dogs affected by PDH. Type II fiber atrophy
is a consistent histopathologic feature of this myopathy.

D.Most dogs with naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism are middle-aged, smal-breed dogs.
Clinical signs of glucocorticoid excess (polyuria/polydipsia, polyphagia, pendulous abdomen) are
typically noted prior to clinical signs of myopathy. A stiff, stilted gait (especially in the pelvic
limbs), weakness, and muscle atrophy may be apparent with hyperadrenocorticoid myopathy.
Both clinical signs and diagnostic test results may be consistent with myotonia, hence the terms

well as upon specific diagnostic tests. Subclinical myopathy has also been documented in dogs
wich hypcradrenocorticism. Other abnormalities supporing the diagnosis may include elevated
CK levels, abnormal discharges on EMG examination (sometimes inchuding waxing and waning
"dive-bomber potcntials and other bizarre high-frequency discharges), and both type I and type
1I fiber arrophy (type II atrophy may predominate) apparent on muscle biopsy samples. Accumu-
lation of intramyofiber lipid droplets and ragged-red fbers (see lipid storage and mitochondrial
myopathies below) has also been feported in cases of hyperadrenocorticoid inyopathy.
d.
Treatment of this myopathy depends upon correcting the undcrlying problem causing the
hyperadrenocorticism (e.g., mirotane treatment for PDH, discontinuing oral prednisonc therapy
with iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism). The prognosis for resolution of the myopathy after
correcting the underlying disorder is guarded to good.
There is evidence in people as well as dogs that hypothyroidism may cause a myopathy. The
pathogenesis is unknown. Potential mechanisms include abnormal carbohydrate merabolism,
abnorinal myofiber mitochondrial activity, problems with triglyceride turnover, and deranged
cation transfer across the sarcolemma. On rmuscle biopsy, type II fber atrophy predominates.
b. The best documented cases of hypothyroid myopathy in dogs were subclinical. However, the
lethargy and intolerance to exercise exhibited by some hypothyroid dogs may be due in pat to
myopathic changcs. The clinician should bear in mind that hypothyroid ncuropathy may
produce similar nonspccific signs of weakness.
C.Diagnosis of this condirion may be difficult (see Hypothyroid Neuropathy, Chapter 14). An
abnormal TSH response test supports the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Creatine kinase levels
may be elevated, and EMG examination may reveal abnormal muscle activity. Muscle biopsy
may reveal preferential type I iber acrophy. Similar to hypothyroid neuropathy, resolution of
clinical signs with thyroid supplementation should support the diagnosis.
d. The prognosis for recovery is unknown, due to the absence of well-documented clinical cases.
a.Malignant hyperthernia is a potentially life-threatening disorder described primarily in dogs, but
also in cats. Thc human disorder is very similar to the canine discase. Therc is somc cvidence
that malignant hyperthermia may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in dogs. The
underlying disorder is abnorrmal calcium (Cat) release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of
myofibers. Sustained calcium release causes sustained muscle contraction with subseqlent
can sometimes rapidly lead to death without prompt and aggressive thcrapy. Thc most common
triggers for hypcrthermic episodes appear to be volatrile anesthetic agents (halothane, isofuranc,
sevofurane) and depolarizing ncuromuscular agents (succinylcholine). In some patients, excite-
ment, stress, or exercise can induce hyperthermic episodes. Finally, one report suggests that the
ingestion of hops from home-brewing kirs can induce malignant hyperthermia episodes in dogs.
b. Unfortunately, clinical signs may not be apparent until a life-threatening hyperthermic episode
is triggered. However, susceptible dogs may have hyperactive temperaments, hypertrophic-

ately. In anesthetized patients, increased CO2 production appears to be the earliest indication of a
hyperthermic episode, so capnography is recommended in suspect patients. Some dogs with the
exercise-induced form of the diseasemay have a history of intolerance to mild to moderate
exercise with clinical signs of muscle weakness of varying severity.
C.
Definitive diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia can be attained with in-vitro caffeine- or halo
thane-contracture tests, using muscle biopsy tissue from a suspect patient. Unfortunately, this
mode of testing is difficult to perform and is not widely available.Thc muscle sample is exposed
to a level of caffeine or halothane that will not cause muscle contracrure in a normal animal.A
contracture response by the muscle tissue supports a diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia.
Histopathologic changes in muscle biopsy samples tend to be either inapparent or mild and
nonspecific. A tentative diagnosis is based upon observing a hyperthermic episode associated with
a known triggering incident. When confronted with an exercise-intolerant animal in which
malignant hyperthermia is suspected, the clinician must be extremely cautious when attempting
to reproduce the reported symptoms by exercising the patient. An inordinate increase in rectal
temperature (e.g., from normnal to 105°F or above) after a short period of mild exercise in a
relatively cool environment is very suspicious for the exercise-related form of malignant hyper-
thermia.A suspect patient should not be exercised to the point of collapse,and provisions should
be made to allow for rapid cooling of the patient at a moment's notice. In other words, the
clinician should not assume that a severe positive response will not be induced in a suspect
patient; prepare for the worst-case scenario.
upon the severity of the episode. In all suspected cases, all potentially riggering anesthetics and/
or neuromuscular blocking agents should be discontinued. Measures to reduce the body tempera-
rure are institured immediatcly as well, such as using cold water lavages and enemas and placing
ice packs over large superficial veins. Non-calcium-containing intravenous fuids may be used to
manage hyperthermia and must be frequently used to treat hypotension. Dantrolene sodium is a
drug that blocks calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum;it is recommended intrave-
nously at a dosage of 2-3 mg/kg in cases of malignant hyperthermia. If metabolic acidosis is
suspected or confirmed, intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be administered as needed.
Hyperkalemia, if present, may be treated with intravenous fuids, insulin, and glucose. There is
no maintenance treatment for prevention of further hyperthermic episodes in malignant hyper-
thermia patients other than avoiding likely triggers of these episodes.The prognosis is guarded,
but may be improved by carly recognition and treatment of this disorder.
a.Also referred to as exertional rhabdomyolysis, this disorder has been described primarily in racing
greyhounds. The pathogenesis is unknown but may involve abnormal myofiber glycogen metabo-
lism or elcctrolyte abnormalities. Exercise induces a series of events culminating in muscle
swelling and necrosis.
b. Clinical signs typically occur associated with a race and include myalgia, tachypnea, and extreme
distress. Myoglobinuria may develop in severe cases.
C.Diagnosis is based upon characteristic clinical features of the disorder in a susceptible dog (e.g,
racing greyhound). Creatine kinase levels willbe markedly elevated and muscle biopsy samples
will reveal rmultifocal hemorthage and myofber necrosis. These patients may also have varying
degrees of metabolic acidosis.
d.Treatment consists of intravenous Huid therapy to prevent or correct hypovolemic shock and to
aid in the renal excretion of myoglobin. Some dogs will be hyperthermic and will need to be

cooled down (see malignant hyperthermia treatment above). Intravenous sodium bicarbonate
may also be indicated in severely acidotic patients. Suggested preventative measures include
proper air-conditioning of kennels, decreasing the frequency of racing in susceptible dogs, oral
potassium and sodium bicarbonate supplementation, and cool-water baths to reduce body
temperature immediately prior to racing. The prognosis for this condition is guarded and
depends upon the severity of clinical signs. Dogs with severe symptoms and myoglobinuria are in
danger of dying of renal failurc within 48 hours.
7.Li aiy
a.Defects in myofiber energy metabolism leading to myopathies are well characterized in humans.
Though the specific metabolic defects have not been fully characterized, analogous disorders
(mainly type II fbers), but most of the energy provided to myofbers at rest, for normal levels of
activity, and for sustained low-intensity exercise, is derived from free fatty acids via bera-oxidation.
in the mitochondria (mainly type I fibers).
Fatty acids undergo an ATP-dependent acylation reaction with coenzyme A (CoA) prior to
oxidation, forming fatty acyl-CoA molecules. The amino acid carnitine is required to transport
these “activated” fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane so that they can be
oxidized by the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes to produce energy. An enzyme called
carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) is necessary for binding the carnitine molecule to the free
fatty acid (with subsequent release of the CoA molecule) prior to transport across the inner
mitochondrial membrane. The fatty acyl-carnitine ester is transported across the inner mitochon-
drial membrane by a carrier protein.
Carnitine also has an importanr buffering function in the myofiber. If short- and medium-
chain fatty acyl molecules accumulate within the mitochondria, they can interfere with mito-
chondrial function. Carnitine is required to bind to these fatty acyl groups, forming
acyl-carnitine esters that can be transported out of the mitochondria and excreted in the urine.
Lipid storage myopathies include primary (uncommon) and secondary carnitine deficiency,
as well as deficiency of the CPT enzyme.Histopathologically, myofibers exhibit increased levels
of lipid inclusions in most of these disorders, especially in type I fibers. The mitochondrial
myopathies include a wide spectrum of possible defects in energy substrate transport and utiliza-
tion, particularly defects in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation.The majority of
mitochondrial myopathies are due to mutations of mitochondrial DNA. Histopathologically,
abnormal subsarcolemmal accumulations of mitochondria may give the characteristic appearance
of ragged red fbers whenn a trichrome stain is used.However, many mitochondrial myopathies
are not associated with ragged red fibers.
There is considerable overlap between lipid storage and mitochondrial myopathies, and the
distinction between the disorders is often unclear.Some mitochondrial myopathics may be
characterized by lipid accumulation within myofibers, and many cases of secondary carnitine
deficiency may be due to an underlying mitochondrial defect.A defect in the mitochondrial
respiratory enzyme chain is likely to lead to mitochondrial accumulation of short- and medium
chain fatty acyl molecules, proximal to the defect. By virtue of its buffering capacity, carnitine is
likely to become depleted secondarily, with carnitine being lost in the urine as acyl-carnitine
esters. Therefore, a carnitine-associated lipid storage myopathy may develop secondarily to an
underlying mitochondrial myopathy.
b. There are a number of reports of suspected lipid storage and mitochondrial myopathies in dogs.
In one report,the clinical pathologic features of 25 dogs with lipid storage myopathies were
described. Most of the reported dogs with lipid storage myopathies have been adults. Clinical
signs of dysfunction include acute and chronic myalgia (often diffcult to localize), weakness,
muscle atrophy, stiffness,lameness, exercise intolerance,and tremors. Cardiomyopathy appears to
be a rare presentation in dogs and is usually associated with primary carnitine deficiency in
490
people. Suspected mitochondrial myopathy has been reported in juvenile Clumber and Sussex
Spaniels, as well as young adult Old English Sheepdog littermates.These patients exhibited
exercise intolerance, as well as exercise-induced metabolic acidosis.Serum levels of both lactate
and pyruvate were elevated in these dogs after exercise. A deficiency of the pyruvate dehydroge-
nase complex has been demonstrated in the Clumber and Sussex Spaniels. The exact biochemical
defect in the sheepdogs is currently unknown.
c.Diagnosis of these disorders rests heavily on the histopathologic demonstration of intramyofber
thies) in fresh frozen muscle biopsy samples of patients with clinical cvidence of myopathy These
abnormalitics are found mainly in type I fibers. Creatine kinase levels may or may not be
elevated in these disorders, and EMG findings may or may not reveal abnormalities. Abnormal
mality in fatty acid oxidation as a cause for myopathy, erum lactate and pyruvate levels may be
helpful both in differentiating between lipid storage and mitochondrial myopathies and in
identifying the specific defect in mitochondrial disorders.
In the report of 25 dogs,all cases demonstrated lactic acidosis,as well as increased urinary
levels of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine. A defect in mitochondrial oxidative function (mitochon-
drial myopathy) was suspected in the majority of cases. Carnitine levels in serum, muscle, and
urine can also help identify primary and secondary carnitine deficiency myopathies. In the 25
dogs with lipid storage myopathy, elevated urinary levels of carnitine and carnitine esters were
found in all but two cases,but plasma carnitine levels were normal in all but two dogs.A
secondary loss of carnitine due to a mitochondrial defect was suspected.
d. Information concerning treatment and prognosis is scant, although there is anecdotal evidence
that dogs with lipid storage and mitochondrial myopathies may respond to various treatments.
Some patients with carnitine deficiency will show a clinical response to oral L-carnitine supple-
mentation (50 mg/kg, q 12 hr). Oral supplementation with ribofavin (50-100 mg per day),
vitamin C (50 mg/kg per day), and coenzyme Q (1 mg/kg/day) have been recommended for
people with mitochondrial myopathies,but the efficacy of these treatments is questionable. There
is some evidcncc in people with mitochondrial myopathies that creatine monohydrate may be
beneficial. Finally, dietary management, including a low-fat, high-carbohydrate, high-protein diet,
supplemented with medium-chain triglyccrides may provide some benefitby bypassing the
nonfunctional pathway(s) in some of these disorders.
a.Glycogen storage disordcrs are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism in which an enzyme
necessary for the synthesis or degradation of glycogen is deficient.Histopathologically,vacuolated
myofbers are often observed, the vacuoles being filled with glycogen.
b. Clinical signs of glycogen storage diseases usually develop in the first year of life and typically
include progressive muscular weakness (often exercise related), muscle atrophy, and poor growth
as compared to normal littermates. However, a glycogen storage disorder with delayed manifesta-
tions of clinical signs was reported in a 10-year-old Abyssinian cat with a 4-year history of
neuromuscular dysfunction. Some patients may have megaesophagus with resultant regurgitation
and aspiration pneumonia, and some may have cardiac abnormalities. The glycogen storage
diseases reported in dogs and cats include the following:
(1) Glycogenosis type II (acid maltase or a-1, 4-glucosidase deficiency, described in Lapland
dogs.
(2) Glycogenosis type II (amylo-1,6-glucosidase deficiency) described in German Shepherd and
Akita dogs. Glycogenosistype Il with autosomal recessive inheritance has becn reported in
 Curly-Coated Retrievers. Progresivc hepatomegaly is an additional clinical feature in these
soop
(3) Glycogenosis type IV (a-1,4D-glucan deficiency), described in Norwegian Forest cats.
15/ MYOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF SKELETAL MUSCLE
491
(4) Glycogenosis type Vlf (phosphofructokinasc defciency), reportcd in English Springer Spaniel
dogs. These dogs rarely exhibit clinical signs of myopathy. They usually cxhibit compensated
intermittent hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinuria, due to defective erythrocytes. This has
also bcen reported in an American Cocker Spaniel dog. A syndrome of dyserythropoiesis,
Imyopathy, and cardiac dysfuncrion has been described in related English Springer Spaniel
dogs. Howevcr, this is not thought to represent a glycogen storage lisease, but rather a defect
in DNA synthesis and rcplication.
c.Definitive diagnosis requires demonstrating deficient enzymatic activity for the cnzyme of interest
dog or cat of a suspect breed, abnormal CK levcls and/or EMG activity, and cvidence of myof-
ber glycogen accumulation on rmuscle biopsy. A genetic test has been developed to identify
Curly-Coated Retriever carriers for glycogenosis type III.
d. There are no effectivc treatments for rhese diseases, and most patients are euthanized due to
 progressive debilitation within the first 1 to 2 years of life.
C. Inflammatory/infectious
a.Masticatory myositis is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies are directed against the
disease is uncertain, although recent studies have uncovercd a primary role of lymphocytes,
particularly T' cells, in this disorder. The distinct myosin isoform and myofibcr type (type HIM)
of masticarory muscles may explain why they are preferentially targetcd by the immune response.
These type IIM myofibers have a diffcrent embryologic origin (branchial arch mesoderm) than
appendicular myofbcrs (paraxial mesoderm) and are believed to be antigenically distincr from
these latter fiber types.
b. Dogs of numerous breeds (usually large breeds) and both sexes have been reported with this
disorder, but the German Shepherd dog seerms to be particularly predisposed. Most dogs with
masticatory rmyositis are young adults. However, juvenile onset of masticatory myositis has been
reported in 12-week-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs. Cats are rarely reported with this
disorder. Clinical signs typically include painful swelling of the masticatory muscles and varying
dcgrccs of trismus. Clinical signs are often acute in onset and may be recurrcnt. Fxophthalmos
and fever are also occasionally observed. Palpation of the masticatory muscles and atrempts to
force the jaws open often elicit a pain response. Some dogs have a history of chronic masticatory
muscle atrophy without obvious painful swelling (Fig. 15.8). These dogs rmay represent a more
chronic form of masticatory myositis, nerogenic atrophy from trigeminal neuritis, or a distinc
atrophiic rmyopathy of masticatory muscles
myofihers with the immunoreagent Staphylococcal protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(SPA-HRPO). This can be done using frozen scctions of the patient's temporalis muscle or incubat-
ing the paticnt's serum with normal stored frozen canine muscle and the immunoreagent. Although
this test has a high sensitivity and specifcity esting for circulating autoantibodies against typI
muscle fbers may yield false-negativc resulrs in a small subset of dogs with masticatory myositis.
Creatine lkinase levels may also be clevated, and EMG examination often reveals abnormalities.
Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may aid in the diagnosis of
dogs with this disorder by showing inhomogeneous contrast enhancement, changes in size, and
focal changes in attenuation of masticatory muscles.Electromyographic evaluation of the mastica
tory muscles is likely to reveal fbrillation potentials and positive sharp waves. Muscle biopsies may
reveal mixed inammatory inflrates, including lymphocytes, macrophages, histiocytes, and,ss
frequently, eosinophils. Neutrophils are rarely seen. Biopsy rcsults may also reveal myofber nccrosis

d. Treatment is immunosuppressive doses of prednisone (1-2 mg/kg per os, q 12 hr) for 34 weeks,
after which the dosage is tapered to every other day. Tapering is slowly continued in order to
achieve the lowest every-other-day dosage that will control clinical signs.Most dogs will show a
replaced by azathioprine as the maintenance immunosuppressant drug, relieving some or all of
the side effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy. In general, the prognosis for this disease is
favorable, although muscle atrophy and/or reduced function may persist.
2. Extraocular myositis31,61,98,247,25,316
 An inflammatory myositis restricted to the extraocular muscles has been reported infrequently in
a.
distinct muscle fibers unique to extraocular muscles, similar to the situation in masticatory
myositis.
b. Dogs reported with this disorder have ranged between 6 months and 8 years of age. No sex
predilection has been found. Six of the 10 dogs were Golden Retrievers in one report. Other
breeds have included a German Shepherd dog, a Doberman Pinscher, a Bullmastiff a Dachs-
hund, and a mixed-breed dog. The predominant clinical sign seen is bilateral exophthalmos of
acute onset (Fig. 15.9). One dog exhibited unilateral exophthalmos. Visual deficits and increased
intraocular pressures have been noted in one dog.
C.
 Diagnosis is based primarily upon clinical signs and muscle biopsy results. Fine-needle aspiration
cytology of affected muscles is an alternative to muscle biopsy and may provide evidence of an
inflammatory infltrate. EMG of the extraocular muscles may reveal abnormalities. A CK level
was measured in one dog with this disorder and found to be normal. In one report, marked

permission6l)
swelling of the dorsal rectus muscles was evident on ultrasonography of the globe. Histopatho-
logicfindings on muscle biopsy include inflammatory infiltrateswith myofiber necrosis and
phagocytosis, as well as areas of hemorrhage. In one dog that was euthanized and necropsied (no
therapy attempted), all extraocular muscles except the retractor bulbi musculature were abnormal.
No other muscle groups were affected.
d. Clinical signs resolved spontaneously in one dog and in all the remaining dogs that were report-
edly treated with oral immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy. One dog relapsed following
glucocorticoid discontinuation,but it responded favorably to reinstitution of therapy.The
prognosis for this disorder appears to be favorable.
3. Laryngeal/pharyngeal myositis32,181,255.21,290
a.Laryngeal and pharyngeal dysfunction associated with evidence of a localized infammatory
myopathy has been described in three dogs, including a 7-year-old male Boykin Spaniel, a 10-
year-old male Malamute, and a 3-year-old female Bouvier des Flandres. Additionally, an inflam-
matory myopathy resulting in pharyngeal dysfunction alone has been reported in three Boxer
dogs (4, 6, and 7 years old) and a 2.5-year-old Briard. The pathogenesis for this disorder is
unknown.
b.Clinical signs may be consistent with laryngeal paralysis (see Chapter 14) and/or functional
dysphagia of chronic duration.
C.Elevated CK levels were seen in the Boxers and the Briard with functional dysphagia. Esophagra-
phy can be used to distinguishfunctional from morphologic dysphagia.EMG abnormalities
(fibrillation potentials,positive sharp waves,complex repetitive discharges) and histopathologic
evidence of an infammatory myopathy (e.g., infammatory infiltrates, myofber necrosis, and
phagocytosis) may be restricted to the laryngeal and/or pharyngeal musculature. Evidence of mild
focal infammation has been reported in the temporalis musculature, the masseter muscles, and
in tongue, diaphragmatic, and gluteal muscles in dogs with laryngeal/pharyngeal myositis.
Testing for autoantibodies against type IIM muscle fbers was negative in all four dogs in which
this test was performed.

APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
d.Treatinent protocols and prognosis for this disorder are as yet undetermined due to the small
number of cases. One dog was euthanized due to respiratory distress, one was treated surgically
(laryngoplasty), and one responded to a combination of corticosteroids and thyroid replacement
therapy.
a.
Autoimmune polymyositis is aninflammatory disease ofunknown pathogenesis,primarily
affecting the appendicular muscles. It is more commonly reported in dogs than cats. While there
is usually no identifiable cause for the immune response,systemic lupus erythematosus, the use
of trimethoprim-sulfa drugs inDobermanPinschers,and thymomas (usuallyin conjunction with
acquired myasthenia gravis) have all been associated with the developmenit of this condition.
A breed-associated polymyositis has been reported in Newfoundlands and Boxers, frequently
demonstrating circulating autoantibodies against a sarcolemmal antigen.
b. While any breed of dog can be affected with this disorder, large-breed dogs, Boxers, and New-
foundlands appear to be overrepresented. Dogs of any age or sex may develop autoimmune
polymyositis, although most are middle-aged. Clinical signs may be acute or chronic and can
include generalized weakness that is often worsened by exercise, hyperesthesia upon muscle
palpation (myalgia), regurgitation (due to megaesophagus), dysphagia, depression, fever, muscle
swelling acutely, muscle atrophy chronically, shifting leg lameness, and voice change. Decreased
or absent spinal refexes may be infrequently seen in dogs with generalized weakness. Affected
age range from 6 months to 5 years) and more frequently prescnt with dysphagia and/or mega
esophagus. None of the reported Newfoundlands exhibited myalgia. A rcccnt study reported
eight Boxers diagnosed with round cell tumors (lymphoma, plasmacytoma, and anaplastic round
cell tumor) months after developing autoimmune polymyositis, suggesting that the latter may
represent a preneoplastic syndrome in this breed. In these cases neoplastic cells were not seen in
the original muscle biopsies, but could be detected in subsequent biopsies.
A combination of autoimmune polymyositis and masticatory myositis, defined as an overlap
syndrome, has recently been reported in three dogs. In these cases, biopsy results were most
consistent with generalized autoimmune polymyositis, although testing for type IIM autoanti-
individual types of infammatory myositis due to the demise of two out of the three affected
dogs (the third dog was lost to follow-up).
Additional subtypes of generalized, presumed autoimmune, polymyositis have been
described. These disorders were described recently under the category of unclassfed myopathies.
Affected dogs in this report overall resembled those with autoimmune polymyositis clinically
although mean ALT levels were significantly higher in dogs with unclassified myositis. Two out
of the seven dogs in this report showed myalgia,and six out of sevenwerefebrile.An additional
report describes five dogs with inflammatory myopathies with primarily histiocytic inflammatory
infiltrates on muscular biopsies. Interestingly, two of the dogs in this report also showed myalgia
and two were febrile on physical examination. A similarity to human histiocytic muscle disorders
wasproposed.
C.Diagnosis is based upon typical clinical findings, as well as results of various diagnostic tests.
Creatine kinase and AST levels may be elevated. Electromyography examination typically reveals
multifocal or diffuse abnormalities, and muscle biopsy reveals myofber necrosis, phagocytosis, and
regeneration, with a non-suppurative infammatory infiltrate. Immunoglobulin localization to the
sarcolermma may also be demonstrable immunohistochemically. Reports of MR imaging in dogs
with nyositis describe diffuse increases in signal intensity on T2-weighted images, decreased signal
intensity on T1-weighted images, and marked contrast enhancerment within affected muscles.
d. Treatment consists of oral prednisone therapy at immunosuppressive doses (e.g., 1-2 mg/kg, q
12 hr) until clinical remission is achieved, with subsequent tapering of the dose. Muscle regenera-

tion may occur if the inflammatory process is halted prior to exhaustion of the muscle's regenera-
tive capacity. The prognosis is generally favorable, although relapses may occur.
a.
 Best described in Collie dogs, dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disorder of skin and, to a
lesser extent, muscle that is believed to be immune-mediated (autoimmune) and heritable as an
autosomal dominant trait. This disorder is also recognized in Shetland Sheepdogs and has been
reported in a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, as well as an Australian Cattle Dog.
b.
Clinical signs of dermatitis usually begin between 2 and 6 months of age in Collies and Shetland
Sheepdogs. Skin lesions predominate in the facial area, cspecially the nose, lips, and tips of the
ears (Fig. 15.10). Some dogs will develop lesions around bony prominences of the lower limbs
and sternum. Clinical signs of myositis are typically mild or inapparent (especially in Shetland
Sheepdogs) and develop after the skin lesions are noticed. Some dogs may have only temporal
and masseter muscle atrophy. Other dogs may develop more prominent signs of a myopathy,
associated with both the dermatitis and myositis tend to wax and wane, and most dogs resolve
spontaneously by 6-8 months of age.
C.
Diagnosis is based mainly upon signalment and clinical signs. Creatine kinase levels are usually
normal, but EMG evaluation usually reveals abnormalities in patients with myositis. Skin and
muscle biopsies confirm the inflammatory disorder. In addition to inflammatory infltrates in
these biopsies, evidence of vasculitis is sometimes evident.
d.Although the efficacy of immunosuppressive oral prednisone therapy is questionable, an initial
dose of 12 mg/kg, q 12 hr, with subsequent tapering, is recommended. Since the disease tends
to resolve spontaneously without therapy, it is difficult to assess the efficacy of this treatment.
Hypoallergenic shampoos are recommended. Treatment with pentoxifylline appears to help
resolve clinical signs in affected dogs as well. The prognosis is typically good for recovery.
6.Fel hyresthesia sme20
a.Feline hyperesthesia syndrome (FHS) is a well-described, yet poorly understood disorder of
unknown etiology. Affected cats intermittently display clinical signs suggesting an irritative
phenomenon, and proposed causes have included behavioral and seizure disorders. There is
recent evidence that FHS represents a myopathy, with histopathologic muscle biopsy features

idiopathic inflammatory myopathy of elderly pcople. Muscle biopsies from such patients contain
numerous rimmed vacuoles (inclusion bodies) containing protcins that are commonly found in
brains of Alzheimer's patients (e.g., paired helical flaments, presenilin I, beta-amyloid precursor
protein). Similar inclusions were reccntly identified in epaxial musclc biopsy samples from cats
with FHS. Inclusion body myositis is believed to be a degenerative myoparhy, with a sccondary
immunc-mediated inffammatory response.

Diagnosis is bascd primarily on historical complaints and clinical signs. Blood work, spinal
imaging, infectious discase titers, cerebrospinal fuid analysis, and electroencephalography evalua-
tions are typically normal. Spontaneous EMG activity was documented in the thoracolumbar
findings similar to those found in human inclusion body myositis. Rimmed intramyofiber
vacuoles conraining paired helical filaments and beta-amyloid were found in biopsies from all
affccrcd cats.
d.1
Feline hyperesthesia syndrome tends to progress over 1 to several years. Similar to human
inclusion body myositis, no consistently effective therapies have been identified for FlHS. Pro-
posed treatment options include corticosteroids (prednisolone), tricyclic anti-depressants (clomip-
ramine, amitriptyline), and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine,fuoxetine),
Phenobarbital may also be used if the aforemcntioncd oprions are not effective. Lifestyle changes,
such as minimizing environmental stressors and/or prescrvarivc-free diets supplemented with
coenzyme Qo, carnitine, and omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful as well The prognosis for
control of this disease syndromc is poot.
a.
Although infectious myositis is relatively uncommon, there are numerous microbial agents that
can lead to myopathies in dogs and cats. A detailed description of all these infectious myopathies
is beyond the scope of this text. Most infectious myopathies are polymyopathies and represent a
facet of multisystemic illness. Viral-associated myopathies are rare, but feline immunodeficiency
virus (FIV) has been shown to induce a subclinical myopathy in experimentally infected cats.
Clostridial species are most commonly implicated in bacterial myositis; these infections may be
focal, involving one or several muscles in onc limb. Leptospira species have also been associated
with myositis in dogs. Protozoal myopathics include those due to Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora
caninum,lepatozoon canis,and Babesia canis and Babesia gibsoni.Sarcocystis species have been
identified in canine and felinc skcletal muscle. Two reports describe clinical disease in dogs due
to Sarcocyszs-induced myositis. However, evidence of clinical disease in cats is lacking. Myositis
can also be due to rickettsial infection (e.g, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spottcd fever). Rarely,
parasitic infestations (e.g, Trichinella spiralis, Ancylostoma caninum, and Trypanosoma cruzi) are
associated with myositis.
b. Clinical signs typically include fever and myalgia. With bacrcrial infections, there may be a recent
history of a bite wound or surgery. Clostridial infections are often characterized by palpable
crepitus, duc to gas accumulation in rissues. Toxoplasma and Neospora infections in young dogs
often result in rigid hyperextension of the pelvic limbs due to a combincd neuropathy/myopathy

myalgia, fever, cachexia, anorexia, Iethargy, paresis, oculonasal discharge, and bloody diarrhea.
 Diagnosis of an infectious myositis is based upon demonstraring the presence of a likely causative
biopsy samples; in othcrs, scrial serology or wound culture is necessary to identify the organism's
presence. Creatine kinase levels are likely to be elevated, and basic blood work may reveal
evidence of a systemic infammatory response (e.g, neutrophilic leukocytosis). Radiographic

regimens and prognostic information for these various discascs. Culture and sensitivity testing
should he pursued with bacterial infections to help guide antimicrobial thcrapy. Surgical drainage
may be requircd in some cases. Antibiotics cffective against anaerobes (e.g., penicillins, clindamy-
cin, metronidazole) are recommended to combat clostridial infections. Penicillins, tetracyclines,
and erychromycin are often initial drug choices for infections with Leptospira organisms.
Trimethoprim-sulfa drugs, pyrimcthamine-sulfonainide combination, and clindamycin are
appropriate drug choices for Toxoplasma and Neospora infections. These drugs as wellas thc

zoon infections. Numerous drugs have been used for Babesia infections in dogs: diminazene
aceturatc and phenamidine isethionate appear to be most effecrive. Doxycycline is often used to
treat rickertsial infections; chloramphenicol is also often effective.

a.Tetanus is not technically a discase of skeletal miuscle. However, because the clinical effects
primarily are associated with skeletal muscle, it is included in this chapter. This disorder is
uncommon in dogs and rare in cats and is calsed by a tetanospxasmin toxin (an exotoxin)
produced by the vegetative form of the bacterium Clostridium tetani, an anacrobic, spore-forming
bacillus. Dogs are very resistant to the effects of reranus toxin, and cats are over 10 times more
resistant than dogs. Spores of Clostridium tetani are ubiquitous in the environment and can be
found in thc fcces and on the skin of normal dogs and cats. When spores are introduced into
tissues under anacrobic conditions, such as penetrating wounds, contaminated body caviry
surgery (e.g., ovariohystercctomy), or dental infections, they may germinate to become the
vegetative exotoxin-producing form of the organism.
Tetanospasmin toxin enters the telodendria of motor nerve axons at neuromuscular junctions
of skeletal muscle (end plates), then travels retrograde to eventually reach the central nervous
system. The toxin may enter the end plate region directly from a nearby wound or localize ar. end
plates in several areas of the body following hematogenous disscmination. With hematogenous
dissemination, some toxin may cross the blood-brain barrier directly to enter the central nervous
system (CNS). 1he toxin interferes with the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (primarily
glycine, also GABA) by inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord (Renshaw cells) and brain. The
clinical result is uncontrolled and sustaincd skeletal muscle contraction, most eviden in extensor
muscles. The autonomic nervous system can also be affected by tetanospasmin roxin.
b.Ietanus can be localized (i.c., involving one fegion of the body, such as the head or one limb) or
generalized. Localized tetanus ofen progresses to generalized tctanus, but some cascs may remain.
localized throughour the disease course. 'The onset of clinical retanus after sustaining a wound or
surgical contamination (if this is part of the history) is variable. The range is from 3 ro 18 days,
most often 5-10 days. Since cats are more rcsistant to the tetanus toxin, the delay may be up to
3 weeks. In dogs, evidence of an active infection is often elusive and may not be present. Cats
with tetanus typically will have a readily evident source of infection and toxin production.
Muscle stiffness is the hallmark of tetanus in dogs and cats, whether it is localized or generalized.
Localized tetanus of a limb is often associated with a wound on the affected limb. The affected

limb is typically stiff and hyperextended. The stiffness may spread to the opposite limb (e.g
both pelvic limbs) and continue to progress to the thoracic limbs. Localized tetanus of the head
region can also occur. This may represent an early stage of generalized tetanus after hematog-
enous spread of the toxin, with the shorter cranial nerves affording a more rapid delivery of toxin
to the CNS than the motor nerves of the extremities.
Involvcmentofmuscles aroundtheheadusuallyleadstoverycharacteristicfeatures.Facial
muscle contraction is seen as narrowed palpebral fissures and drawing back of the lips (risus
sardonicus), as well as wrinkling of the forehead with the tips of the ears being pulled toward
cach other (Fig. 15.11). Extraocular muscle involvement leads to enophthalmos with protrusion
of the third eyelids, and masticatorymuscle contraction results in an inability to opcn the mouth
(trismus, or “lockjaw"). Ocular changes (including enophthalmos, blepharospasm, strabismus)
may be the only signs seen in early-stage tetanus. Laryngeal and pharyngeal musculature may
also be affected, with resultant dyspnea (due to laryngospasm) and dysphagia, respectively.
of both laryngeal and lower respiratory musculature. Affected animals often seem willing to eat,
but they have difficulty prehending and swallowing food.
Gencralized tetanus is more common than localized, and many localized cases progress to
of all limbs, along with the above-described clinical abnormalities involving the hcad region. If
the patient remains ambulatory, the gait will be stiff and stilted, and a wide-based, “sawhorse”
stance will be evident.If the patient is recumbent, thelimbs are often held out in rigid hyperex
tension, with the tail curved dorsally (Fig. 15.12). Reflex muscular spasms tend to occur in
response to tactile or auditory stimuli.Because of increased urethral and anal sphincter tone,
urine retention and constipation often occur in tetanus patients.Some animals develop a hiatal
hernia or megaesophagus with resultant regurgitation. Autonomic dysfunction (autonomic
storms) may occur, leading to tachycardia, bradycardia, other cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., atrioven-
tricular block,ventricular escape beats),hypotension,or hypertension.Parasympathetic overactiv-

ity has been reported to occur more frequently than sympathetic signs. Rectal temperature is
often elevated in dogs and cats with tetanus due to sustained muscle contraction, persistent
clostridial infection,orboth.With generalized tetanus,death may resultfrom progrcssive
respiratorycompromise.
C.
Diagnosis of tetanus is usually based upon characteristic clinical features in addition to historical
information (e.g., prior wounding or surgical procedure). Identifying an active source of infec-
tion and toxin production supports the diagnosis. However, in a subset of dogs with tetanus,a
wound or active infection may not be clinically evident.If an active infection is present, this may
be refected in blood work results (e.g., neutrophilic leukocytosis). Electromyographic abnormali-
tics and elevated serum CK levels may be evident, but muscle biopsy (not recommended) results
are likely to be normal. Attempts at culturing Clostridium tetani from wounds are often unpro-
ductive. The reliability of measuring serum antibody levels against tetanus toxin is questionable.
d.Treatment of tetanus is aimed at prevention of continued toxin production,neutralization of any
tetanus toxin not yet bound to the CNS, and supportive care. Continued toxin production
occurs in the presence of an active infection.A thorough search for an infection source should be
undertaken. If found, the source should be drained and debrided. Depending on the location of
the wound, fushing with hydrogen peroxide may inhibit clostridial growth by increasing oxygen
tension in the wound. Regardless of whether an active clostridial infection is located, antibiotics
effective against Clostridium tetani should be administered for10-14 days.Penicillin G is often
considered the antibiotic of choice,but there is evidence thatmetronidazole may be more
effective. Other drugs with activity against Clostridium tetani include clindamycin and tetracy-
cline.If a wound site is located, small doses of antibiotic (e.g penicillin G) canbe infltrated
around the wound area in addition to parenteral therapy.
Antitoxin administration may be used in order to prevent further binding of circulating
tetanospasmin toxin to the CNS. The major side effect and concern associated with antitoxin
administrationis anaphylaxis.The dose ofequine antitoxinfor small animalsis100-1000U/kg
given intravenously over 10 minutes. Larger animals receive a proportionally smaller dose than
smaller animals.Prior to administration, a test dose of0.1-0.2 ml of antitoxin should be adminis-
tered either subcutaneously or subdermally. The test site should be observed for 15-30 minutes for
wheal development. If a wheal develops, an anaphylactic reaction is likely to occur. The clinician
may decide to forgo antitoxin in this scenario or proceed with extra caution, depending on the
particular nature of the individual case.Premedication with glucocorticoids and antihistamines is
500
advisable prior to intravenous injection of antitoxin,regardless of the results of the test dose. If an
anaphylactic reaction develops,or is strongly suspect
ted to develop (based on test dose results),
intravenous epinephrine (diluted to 1 : 10,000) at 0.1 ml/kg is the therapy of choice. It is advisable
to have this drug drawn up and ready to adiminister before antitoxin is given. A small amount of the
antitoxin dose (e.g., 1000 units) may also be infiltrated around the wound site, if onc is identified.
Supportive care of the tetanus patient can be very labor-intensive. Nutritional and hydration
needs must be met, with tube-feeding required in some animals. Enemas and urinary expression/
catheterization may be required in some patients. Because of hypersensitivity to auditory and
tactile stimuli (reflex muscle spasms), severely affected tetanus patients may need to be sedated.
Combinations of promazine drugs (e.g., acepromazine, chlorpromazine) in combination with
either diazepam or barbiturates are most effective. Caution is advised with barbiturate use, as
tetanus patients are often respiratory-compromised and barbiturates may lead to cardiorespiratory
depression.Muscle relaxants, such as methocarbamol, may also be used to diminish miuscle
rigidity. Frequent turning and soft bedding are nec
ssary to prevent complications such as aspira-
tion pneumonia and decubital ulcers. Additionally reported complications secondary to tetanus
include hiatal hernias, coxofemoral luxation, cardiac arrhythmias, and hyperthermia due to severe
Many tetanuspatientswith severe clinical signs need tobe closely monitored andrequire
intensive nursing care.Ifavoidable,however, they should not be placed innoisy,busy areas, such as
a high-volume intensive care unit.A dark,quiet environment is recommended in order to minimize
possible in dogs and cats. Survival rates ranging from 50% to 92% have been reported in dogs, with
worse prognoses for rccovcry scen in younger dogs and those with more severe clinical signs and/or
autonomic storms. No difference in prognosis was found in two recent reports betwccn dogs that
did or did not receive tetanus antitoxin.The median length of hospitalization cited in retrospective
studies ranges between 13 and 17 days. Overall, dogs often recover within a month of therapeutic
intervention, but cats may require several months to return to normal. Frequently the earliest
indication of improvement is decreased musclerigidity in the pelvic limbs.
D.Ischemic
a.Most commonly reported in cats with cardiomyopathy, this syndrome is due to interruption of
blood supply to the pelvic limbs (less commonly a thoracic limb) by a thromboembolism at the
trifurcation of the distal aorta. The release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., serotonin, thrombox-
ane A2) coincident with the thromboembolic event is thought to severely impair collateral
circulation to the pelvic limbs. Ischemic damage to pelvic limb nerves and muscles, primarily
distal to the stife area, accounts for the characteristic clinical signs. Ischemic neuromyopathy has
also been characterized in dogs. In comparison with cats, a wider variety of conditions can cause
aortic thromboemboli in dogs (see below). Also, the clinical signs are often different in dogs as
compared with cats. Although an ischemic neuromyopathy may manifest acutely, dogs will
frequently present with milder signs initially, such as a chronic lameness, collapse, and/or knuck-
ling of the affected limb(s).

The signs may or may not be symmetric. The gastrocnemius and cranial tibial muscles are
usually firm and painful to palpation, the nail beds of the pelvic limbs are cyanotic, and the
distal aspects of the pelvic limbs are cool to the touch, compared to the thoracic limbs. There is
usually an inability to fex or extend the tarsal joint, although the ability to fex and extend the

hip and stife joints is usually preserved. Femoral pulses are characteristically diffcult or impos-
sible to palpate. In most cases, there is also analgesia of the digits and tarsal arca. Although
involvement of one or both rear limbs is most common, front limb(s) may also be affected in a
small subsetofcases.
Clinical signs in dogs are more variable than cats. In general, dogs tend to have more protracted
clinical signs, varying from subacute to chronic. Some patients may even display intermittent
clinical signs referable to the pelvic limbs. In general, pclvic limb lameness, paresis, and paralysis
occur in dogs with aortic thromboembolism.Abnormal pelvic limb reflexes, cool extremities,
evidence of pain, and decreased digital sensation are also observed in dogs with this disorder.
A tentative diagnosis is based primarily upon signalment, history, and characteristic clinical
findings. Cats, and some dogs, willhave evidence of cardiomyopathy on thoracic radiographs
and/or echocardiography. Embolization of the distal aorta by an air gun pellet has been reported
in one cat. Additionally, feline arterial obstruction may be caused by neoplastic emboli, traveling
in circulation as intravascular metastases.A variety of disease conditions have been associated
with canine aortic thromboembolism and include cardiac disease, neoplasia (neoplastic emboli),
renal dysfunction, immunc-mediated hemolytic anemia, sepsis, and endocrine disorders (e.g.
hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism). Serum CK levels are markedly elevated. Some patients
are also acidotic and hyperkalemic. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
may also be elucidated (low platelet count, prolonged activated clotting time, etc.). While not
commonly performed, electrodiagnostic tests will support the diagnosis of a neuromyopathy.
Histopathology of nerve and muscle, if performed, will reveal axonal loss and myofiber necrosis,
respctivcly. In both dogs and cats, ultrasonography and arteriography may be helpful in con-
firming the presence of thromboembolic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging has also been
reportedly useful in diagnosing ischemic neuromyopathies.
d. No single treatment has been proven to be effctive in improving the outcome of these patients.
Suggested therapies directed specifically at the thromboembolic problem have included aspirin
therapy, administration of plasminogen activators (streptokinase, urokinase), administration of
zine), and catheter or surgical (not currently recommended, especially in dilated cardiomyopathy)
embolectomy. Attendant conditions, such as acidosis, hyperkalemia, and DIC, should be
addressed. Specific treatment for cardiomyopathy is also recommended in cats and in those dogs

dent upon the underlying disease. In cats, although many will recover pelvic limb function
thromboemboli include survival rates to discharge ranging from 0% to 45% of cascs, with
subsequent median survival times of 77 days or 223 days, for cats presenting with and without
congestive heart failure, respectively.Additional reports of median survival times for cats range
from 51 to 184 days. Longer survival times are seen overall in cats in which a single limb was
affected, those presenting with motor function in the affected limb(s), and those that were not
These values are likely afected by the presence of underlying disease and by the use of preventa-
tive therapies. Prophylactic aspirin therapy (25 mg/kg, every third day) has been recommended
for recovering and recovered cats,but there is no evidence of efficacy.
E.Traumatic
a.
Infraspinatus contracture is an uncommon injury encountered mainly in hunting and working
dogs and can manifest in acute or chronic stages. The acute stage may be observed during or
shortly after physical exertion, secondary to trauma or sprain of the infraspinatus muscle.As this
muscle swells due to edema and/or hematoma formation,it does so within the confines of
surrounding fascia and bony structures.
. This increased tissue pressure within a confined space, if
sufficiently high, may lead to decreased perfusion,with subsequent ischemic damage of the
muscle and/or nerves locally (defined as comp
artment. syndrome).Frequently,the acute phase
may not be witnessed, and the animal may present in the chronic phase of the injury. The
presumed initial damage rcsults in subsequent contracture and fbrosis of the infraspinatus
muscle, causing a characteristic thoracic limb gait abnormality. Development of peri-articular
connective tissue contributes to clinical signs of lameness.A similar disorder has been reported
associated with injury to the teres minor muscle.Additionally,compartment syndrome has been
reported within the caudal thigh muscles (caudal femoral compartment) in a dog, occurring
secondary to a muscular hemangiosarcoma.
b. Hunting and working dog breeds are most commonly affected by this myopathy; there is no age
or sex predilcction. Bilateral involvement has been reported, but is very uncommon.
In acutc presentations, with suspected compartment syndrome, a sudden-onset severe lame-
ness is seen, usually during exercise. The shoulder muscles appear swollen and are painful and tense
 on palpation. In chronic cases, the typical gait abnormality often develops 2-6 weeks after the
initial shoulder injury. In these cases, there is usually a history of an acute thoracic limb lameness
that improved or resolved with rest and anti-infammatory drugs. The typical gait of dogs with
infraspinatus contracture is characterized by elbow adduction,with excessive lateral or outward
rotation (abduction) of the humerus. Affected dogs may hold the thoracic limb in this position
while stationary (Fig. 15.14). When walking, these dogs often exhibit a compensatory “flip”" of the
carpus on the affected limb. Limited range of motion of the shoulder joint may also be appreci
ated. Atrophy of scapular musculature associated with the affected limb is often evidcnt.
C.
Diagnosis is based primarily upon historical and clinical features. Ultrasonography of the shoul
der region may allow identification of the abnormal infraspinatus muscle.Electromyographic
abnormalities are often present, but the damaged muscle may be electrically silent (e.g., if
virtually replaced by fibrous connective tissue). Muscle biopsy confirms fibrous connective tissue
replacement of muscle fibers in chronic cases. In acute presentations, biopsy may reveal necrosis
and swelling of the muscle through the facial incision may be seen. Increased intracompartmental
pressure may also be confirmed using various specialized catheters (wick catheter, slit catheter
solid-state transduser intracompartmental catheter). Normal intrafascial pressure ranges between
-2 and +8 mm Hg
15/MYOPATHIES:DISORDERSOFSKELETALMUSCLE
503

d. In acute cases, when compartment syndrome is suspected, surgical decompression via a fasci-
otomy should be performed as soon as possible to decrease intracompartmental pressure and
prevent continued ischemic muscle/nerve damage.Treatment for chronic presentations consists of
surgical tenomyectomy of the abnormal infraspinatus,with removal of all visible peri-articular
fibrous tissue. Prognosis for recovery is excellent following surgery.
 2. Iliopsoas muscle injury46,270.314
a.Pelvic limb lameness due to a suspected strain injury to the iliopsoas musculature has been
reported in four adult dogs and a 12-week-old puppy. In many of these cases, an inciting
secondary to iliopsoas muscle pathology was reported in two of these cases.
b. Two dogs experienced an acute onset of pelvic limb lameness, the other three dogs exhibited
chronic lamenes. One of the affected dogs exhibited bilateral pelvic limb involvement. When
standing, this dog showed external rotation of the pelvic limbs ("cow-hocked” stance). All dogs
displayed signs of discomfort upon extension of the associated coxofemoral joint. A painful
(hyperesthetic) response was also appreciated upon palpation of the affected iliopsoas muscle(s),
at the lesser trochanter, ventromedial to the ilium, and/or per rectum. Also, simultaneous
internalrotation and extensionof theaffectedcoxofemoral jointelicitedpainin all dogs.The
affectedlimb showed a decreased patellarreflex,indicatingfemoral nerve involvement in two of
these cases. Additionally, absent sensation to the medial aspect of the thigh, leg, and pes was
noted in the puppy, suggesting saphenous nerve involvement.
C.1
 Diagnosis was based upon finding pain associated with the iliopsoas muscle on clinical examina-
tion, as well as demonstrating abnormal iliopsoas musculature on ultrasonography (e.g)

musculature) in one dog. Muscle abnormalities could not be seen on ultrasound or on CT
evaluation in one case, but could be detected with MR imaging (focal area of hyperintensity on
 T2-weighted images with mild hyperintensity on T1-wcighted images, and no contrast
enhancement).
d. Most dogs responded well to rest and treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). Lameness recurred or did not respond to conservative management in two dogs,
despite rest and NSAID therapy. Both of these dogs responded well to tenomyectomy of the
iliopsoas muscle.
3. Quadriceps contracture (stiff stifle syndrome)3743.173
a.
This is a phenomenon most commonly associated with inadequate fracture repair and/or pro-
longed immobilization of distal femoral fractures in young dogs, especially of large breeds. Other
conditions, such as ostcomyclitis of the femur,may also lead to this sequelaInfammation and
With prolonged disuse of the limb, periarticular fibrosis of the stife develops.
b. Clinical signs typically include progressive pelvic limb extension and lameness following an
orthopedic injury. Muscle contracture and disuse atrophy often progress to the point that the
limb is nonfunctional. The affected limb is usually abducted, and there is severe limitation of the
range of motion in the stifle joint.
C.
Diagnosis is based on characteristic historical and clinical features. Muscle fiber size variability,
fibrosis, and necrosis are characteristic muscle biopsy features. Extensive muscle fiber atrophy,
 predominantly affecting type I fibers, is also typical.
d.Proposed treatments for quadriceps contracture include surgical breakdown of fbrous tissue, Z
plasty of the quadriceps muscle group, and stife arthrodesis in a functional walking angle. In
general, the prognosis for a functional limb once contracture has developed is guarded to poor.
Efforts should be focused on preventing this condition.
4. Gastrocnemius muscle avulsion263.265.267.319
a.
Avulsion or rupture of the proximal attachment of the gastrocnemius muscle has been reported
sporadically in dogs. There is usually a known traumatic event associated with this injury, but
atraumatic avulsion of this muscle has also been described.
b. Clinical signs include cirhcr a unilateral or bilateral pelvic limb lameness, often of chronic
duration. A plantigrade stance with excessive hock fexion and a crouched gait is characteristic.
Other clinical features may include fexion of the digits and pelvic limb muscle atrophy.
C. In addition to clinical features, radiographic abnormalities such as distal displacement of the
fabellae and osteophyte formation in the region of the gastrocnemius muscle origin contribute to
a tentative diagnosis. Confirmation of muscle avulsion may be confirmed at surgery if reattach-
ment is attempted.
d. Some dogs have responded to external support and NSAID therapy, whereas others have
appears to be generally favorable but may require several months to occur.
a.A transient faccidity of the tail occurs in hunting dogs, primarily Pointers and Labrador Retriev-
ers. Other reported breeds include setters and foxhounds. The condition is believed to be
traumatic and is theorized to involve a compartment syndrome phenomenon (see Chapter 14) in
some cases. Common factors that appear to predispose dogs to developing this disorder include
 strenuous exercise following a period of underconditioning, prolonged cage transport, and cold
weather.
b.Affected animals are typically adult hunting dogs.A sudden onset of tail faccidity is characteris-
tic, with the tail either hanging from the tail base or projecting horizontally from the tail base for

a short distance (e.g, 8 cm), then hanging downward. The hair on the proximal tail may be
raised early in the disease course. Some dogs exhibit discomfort associated with palpation of the
tail, often most apparent approximately 8 cm distal to the base. During the recovery phase of this
disorder, the tail may hang to onc side.
C. Diagnosis is based primarily on signalment, history, and characteristic clinical signs. An extensive
diagnostic investigation is not often pursued due to the self-limiting nature of the disease. Serum
CK levels may be mildly elevated, and EMG examination typically reveals abnormal spontaneous
muscle activity (e.g., fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves). Thernography and scintigra
phy of the tail region in affcted dogs have been reported to reveal abnormalities. Muscle biopsy
has confirmed pathologic changes in tail rnusculature (e.g., fiber splitting, atrophy, and nccrosis),
particularly in the laterally situated intertransversarius vcntralis caudalis muscles. Intranuscular
nerve fbers were normal. Muscle biopsy is not recommended due to the potential for further
injury to the tail and the high likelihood of rccovery with no intervention.
d. Complete recovery occurs most often within several days, but it may take several weeks in some
cases. Therc is anccdotal evidence that administering anti-infammatory drugs rmay speed recov-
ery if given early on in the diseasc course. In dogs exhibiting discomfort associated with the tail,
administration of analgesic drugs is recommended. Minimizing prolonged cage transpor and
ensuiring a regular training schedule are suggested prcvcntivc mcasurcs

JUNCTIONOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR
JUNCTION
JacquesPenderis
I.Introduction
By the very name, the term neuromuscular junction (NM/) describes the junction berween. an. efferent nerve
(in the context of the diseases discussed in this chapter, usually a somatic efferent nerve) and the muscle
innervated by that nerve. Pathological processes that affcct the NMJ are commonly referred to as
junctionopathies.
II.N
Normal Anatomy and Physiology of thc Ncuromuscuar Juncion,963.6,169.17,180.195
'The NMJ can be subdivided into three basic components: the presynaptic membrane, the synaptic cleft,
and the postsynaptic membrane in the end plate region of a skeletal muscle fiber. The NMJ is part of the
acctylcholine (ACh) group of neurotransmitter systems. ACh neurotransmitter systems are also found in
autonomic ganglia and parasympathetic effector junctions in the peripheral nervous system, in the spinal
motor neuron inncrvates a number of muscle fibers (myofibers); combined, these are termed a motor unit.
For successful NMJ transnuission to occur, the action potential rraveling down a motor neuron to a myofi-
ber must be successfully propagated to the end plate region of the innervated muscle fiber. The arriving
action potential at the level of the nervc rcrminal results in depolarization of this region and consequent
opening of calcium (Cat ) channels on the axolemma surface. The increased cytosolic concentration of Cat-
triggers exocytosis of ACh by causing ACh-containing vesicles to dock and fuse with the plasmalemma at
the synaptic cleft region. Three classes of proteins are involved in the process of ACh exocytosis and all three
are vulnerable to toxins and disease processes:
·Synapsin I (controls thie availability of synaptic vesicles) and synaptotagmin (associates with N-type Ca'
channels)
° Synaptobrevin (vesicle-associated membrane protein), syntaxin and synaptosorne-associated protein 25,
which are all esscntial components of the exocytosis process
●N-ethyl-maleimide-scnsitive fusion protein (NSF) and soluble NSF-attachment proteins, which are all
involved in neurotransmitter release
Thc relcased ACh molecules cross the synaptic cleft to reach the ACh receptors, located on the end-
plate region of the skeletal muscle fbcr. The ACh receptor molecules are inregral membrane proteins
consisting of five subunits and function as sodium (Nat) channels. The five subunits are arranged in a
circular shape around the central Na channel (Fig. 16.1). Located on the extracellular portion of the alpha
(a)-subunit (of which there are two per receptor molecule) are the ACh binding sites. Binding of ACh to
the ACh binding sites rcsults in opening of the Na channcl and Na' infux into the muscle cell. This influux
to reach a threshold to result in sufficient spread of the depolarization along the muscle fiber to cause release
of the intracellular Ca stores and result in muscle contraction.
The magnitude of the FPP dcpends on thc number of ACh receptors activated. In thc normal situation,
there is an overabundance of both available ACh and ACh receptors and the EPP produced by nerve
depolarization cherefore usually far excceds the requirement for muscle contraction; this excess is termed the

safety factor of neuromuscular transmission.During repetitive depolarization of the nerve terminal following
repeated firing of a motor nerve, there is a decrease in the amount of ACh relcascd into the synaptic cleft
with each depolarizing event, a phenomenon termed rundown. In normal individuals, however, the degree
of rundown is insignificant due to the large safety factor of neuromuscular transmission. Following success-
ful NMJ transmission, several processes prevent excessve stimulation of muscle fibers. First, the Na chan-
nels that open following activation of ACh receptors do so only transiently before closing and becoming
refractory for a few seconds. Second, shortly after its release into the synaptic cleft, the ACh is rapidly
eliminated by both diffusion away from the cleft region and by hydrolysis by ACh esterase in the cleft
region.
III.Vulnerability of the Neuromuscular Junction
Disorders affecting neuromuscular transmission are usually classfied as pre- or postsynaptic, although some
disease processes may affect both. Processes affecting neuromuscular transmission may either increase or
decrease the activity of this system and do so by:

° increasing or decreasing presynaptic ACh release, as a result of altering ACh synthesis, transport, reuptake
or presynaptic release.
°altering the concentration or duration of ACh effect in the synaptic cleft as a result of altered removal of
ACh from the synaptic cleft.
* acting as an ACh agonist or antagonist at the NMJ by affecting the interaction between ACh and the
postsynaptic receptor.
Borulism toxin and a-latrotoxin (a toxin elaborated by the black widow spider) can be used as examples
of diseascs affecting the same component of neuromuscular transmission in opposite ways but with the same
cnd result of failure of neuromuscular transmission. Botulism light-chain toxin (the entry of which through
vesicle fusion proteins required for the process of exocytosis. In contrast, a-latrotoxin causes massive ACh
release at the NMJ by apparently increasing the probability of vesicle fusion with the plasmalemma and
inhibiting vesicle recycling.
A.Vulnerability of the axonal transport system
Although not specifically disorders of the NMJ, substances may interfere with normal neuronal and axonal
functions, resulting in disruption of normal anterograde transport of material essential for neurotransmitter
synthesis (including ACh at the NMJ). An example would be vincristine, which nonspecifically blocks
axonal transport.
B. Vulnerability of the presynaptic functions
The functions within the presynaptic region are involved in the reuptake of choline from the synaptic cleft,
the synthesis of ACh, and the storage thereof in synaptic vesicles with a large number of substances and
disease processes known to target these processes.
Exarmples of substances affecting these pathways include the following:
*The Na-dependent high-affinity choline transport system is specifically targeted by hemicholium, which
competes with choline for uptake by thc choline carrier and inhibiting choline uptake, thereby resulting
in NMI blockade.
The enzyme choline acetyltransferase, involved in ACh synthesis, is targeted by a number of substances
including the naphthoquinones and halogenated cholines, which have been shown to be effective enzyme
inhibitors in vitro. Choline acetyltransferase is also targeted by false cholinergic neurotransmitters, including
triethylcholine and diethylaminoethanol, which are acetylated by the enzyme, stored in synaptic vesicles, but
on synaptic release display cholinergic agonist activity below that of ACh (cholinergic hypofunction).
·Vesamicol (an experimental substance) is one of a number of substances shown to induce neuromuscular
blockade by blocking the transport of ACh into synaptic vesicles.
C. Vulnerability of presynaptic release of ACh
Numerous toxins target the presynaptic release of ACh. Botulinum toxin and certain snake toxins (including
Mojave toxin and b-bungarotoxin, among others) block the relcase of ACh from motor axon terminals.As
previously discussed, a-latrotoxin (from the black widow spider) causes NMJ blockade by targeting the same
part of the system, but by causing massive ACh release instead.
D.Vulnerability of ACh esterase
Numerous naturally occurring and synthetic substances target the ACh esterase system, resulting in
increased synaptic residence of ACh and therefore excessive stimulation following ACh release. Some of the
substances (including edrophonium, physostigmine, and neostigmine) bind to the ACh esterase active site
for varying times, while others interact with the active center to form stable complexes (e.g, organophos-
phorous, or OP, compounds).

fexion and respiratory distress (A), followed by collapse into ventral recumbency (B).
E.Vulnerability of nicotinic muscle receptors
A wide variety of compounds targct the nicotinic receptors, either throughout the nervous system or specific
to only the nicotinic receptors of muscle.For example the snake toxin a-bungarotoxin (from the krait
Bungarus multicinctus) blocks the nicotinic muscle receptors, but those in peripheral autonomic ganglia
appear resistant. The compounds affecting the nicotinic muscle receptors include, among others, strychnine
(the indole alkaloid from the Strychnos spp.), many snake toxins, anatoxin-a from blue-green algae and
curare-like substances.
Neuromuscular junction transmission disorders are frequently classified as either presynaptic or postsynaptic.
Irrespective of the cause of failure of neuromuscular transmission, the presenting clinical signs may often be
very similar in charactcr. Junctionopathies usually present as symmetric, progressive muscle weakness of both
the thoracic and pelvic limbs (Fig. 16.2). Tendon reflexes are often intact in the early stages of the disease,
which is useful in distinguishing these diseases from peripheral neuropathies. The NMJ transmission

syndrome frequently demonstrates a predilcction for certain muscle groups, particularly the small, rapid.
moverment muscle groups. For this reason, failure of certain cranial nerve musculature may be apparent,
including failure of the extraocular muscles and muscles controlling the palpebral reflex and alterations in
the voice (dysphonia) and swallowing. Sensory function and level of consciousness are typically unaffected
In some postsynaptic disorders (e.g., organophosphorous compound poisoning),there may be additional
cholinergic signs, including lacrimation, miosis, and bradycardia.
In most cases, removal of the source of NMJ blockade will result in rapid resolution of the clinical
signs, but in some cases there is tight binding of the agent to the NMJ (e.g., botulism) and recovery may
take a prolongcd period of tine.
Based on the classification of NMJ transmission disorders, examples of mainly presynaptic agents
include botulinum toxin, tick saliva, and black widow spider venom. Examples of postsynaptic agents
include anticholinesterase agents, teracycline antibiorics, and interferon-. Most of the toxic NMI transnis-
sion disorders include a combination of both presynaptic and postsynaptic blockades and include snake
envenomation, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and polymyxin antibiotics.
Myasthenia Gravis
1. Congenital myasthenia gravis (MG) is duc to an abnormal reduction in the number of ACh reccp-
tors on the muscular cnd platc, resulting in clinical signs of exercise-induced wcakness.
Terriers, smooth-haired Fox Terriers, Samoyeds, and Miniature Dachshunds. Although reported,
congenital MG is rare in the cat. Clinical signs of recurrent and progressive muscle fatigue usually
become apparent beween 6 and 9 weeks of age. Multiple pups in a litter are usually affected. In
both. the terrier breeds, alutosomal recessive inherirance hias been demonstrared. A myasthenic
syndromc, inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, has hcen described in the Garmmel Dansk
Honsehund dog, where a presynaptic disorder interferes with ACh release. In breeds other than the
Gammel Dansk Honschund and Miniature Dachshund, congeniral MG is characteristically a
progressive disorder, and affectcd dogs arc often unable to walk. All breeds may bc prcdisposed to
developing aspiration pneumonia, although megaesophagus is typically demonstrable only in. the
simooth-haired Fox Terrier.
3. Due to the absence of antibodies to ACh receptors in congenital MG, diagnosis is by signalment,
history, and a suitable response to anticholinesterase drugs. Ultrastructural demonstration of
decreased ACh receptors on muscle biopsy may be possible to confirm the postsynaptic disorder
(Fig. 16.3).
4. Although the extent of clinical responsiveness is often incomplete and unpredictable, anticholinester-
ase therapy (c.g, pyridostigmine) is recomnended for dogs with congenital MG. Remission of
clinical discasc is unlikely in most of these cases, and liflong managcment is therefore equired. The
however, spontaneous resolution of clinical dysfunction by 6 months of age has bcen reported.

1. Acquired MG is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies (in most cascs IgG) are formed against
the nicotinic ACh rcccptors, resulting in decrcased numbers of receptors on thc postsynaptic sarco-
lemmal surface (Fig. 16.4). In the majority of both human and canine cases, these antibodies havc
been shown to recognize thc same cpitopes on the ACh receptor. These epitopes are primarily
located in the main immunogenic region of the two alpha subunits, on the extracelular surface. The

Antibodies may bind dircctly to thc ACh receptor, resulting in a blockadc of thc ion channel
opening.
Antibodies may increase the degradation rate of ACh receptors by cross-linkage, resulting in a
decreased concentration of receptors at the postsynapric membrane.
Complernent-mediated lysis of the muscle end plate may take place.
Thc consequence of this decrease in normal NMJ traiisinission is skeletal muscle weakness. In
humans, dogs, and cats, a bimodal age of onset has been identifed. Cats are typically affcted
berween 2 and 3 years of age or between the ages of9 and 10 years. In dogs, this bimodal age of
Onser occurs in young dogs berween 4 rnonths and 4 years (average, 3 years) and in older dogs
in the cat as compared to the dog. Purebred cats tend to develop MG more often than mixed-breed
cats, with the Abyssinian and Somali brccds appearing to be overreprescntcd. In dogs, a high risk for
the discase exists in several breeds,incuding Akitas, several terrier breeds, German Shorthaired
Poinrers, and Chihuahuas. The German Shepherd dog and Golden Retriever demonstrate the highest
absolute morbidiry. Sexually intact dogs may be slightly less likely to dlevelop MG than spayed and
neutered dogs. A group of young adult Newfoundlands from two distinct lineages with acquired
MG were reporred, suggesting a possible heritablc prcdisposition to the disorder in this breed.
Acquired MG can prcscnt in the dog and cat as one of three diffcrent clinical syndromes: focal
MG, generalized MG, and acute fulminaring MG. Acquired MG has been associatcd with other
diseases, and these should be taken into consideration when planning the diagnostic cvaluation of a
0 hypothyroidisn and other autoimmune diseases,
thymomas,
thymic cysts,
nonepitheliotropic cutaneous lymphoma,
cholangiocellular carcinoma,
 anal sac adenocarcinoma,
 osteogenic sarcoma, and
methimazole therapy in cats.
'The association of thymomas and acquired MG has been demonstrated in human patients, dogs,
and cats. The incidence of thymomas in dogs with acquired MG is low, at around 3%, but this
figurc is considerably higher in cats (15%-26%).
2. In MG cascs, the neurologic examination is usually normal whien performed prior to the induction
of exercisc-induced weakness; however, some cases will demonstrate depressed to absent palpebral
reflexes in the absence of generalized muscle weakness. Loss of the palpebral reflex is particularly
noticeable in cats. Tendon refexes are usually norimal. Clinical fndings in canine and feline acquired
MG are summarized in Table 16.1. Focal, gencralizcd, and acute fulminating forms of MG have
been described in dogs and cats. Focal MG presents as a weakness of isolatcd muscle groups, particu-
larly the esophageal, pharyngcal, laryngeal, and facial muscles. Weakness of rhesc musclc groups
occurs in the absence of generalized appendicular muscle weakness. The main presenting clinical
signs in these cases include:
regurgitation secondary to megaesophagus,
dysphagia due to pharyngeal muscle weakness,
dropped jaw.

 diminished or absent palpebral reflexes, and
voice changes (dysphonia) due to laryngeal and/or palatal muscle weakness.
In retrospective studies, 36% of dogs presenting with acquired MG demonstrated focal signs,
compared to only 15% of cats. This difference may be ascribed partially to the larger proportion of
smooth muscle in the feline csophagus as compared to the predominantly striated muscle of the
canine esophagus.
The generalized form of MG is characterized by appendicular muscle weakness that may be
induced or exacerbated by exercise. Typically, severe exercise intolerance develops after only a few
minutes of exercise, but following rest, the animal regains nuscle strength and can rcturn to activity
for a short period before a relapse of the muscular weakness, Regurgitation, especially in dogs, may
absent palpebral refexes may be present as a feature of the muscle weakness. Pharyngeal and laryn-
geal muscle weakness is evidenced by the presence of excessive drooling, a moist and productive
cough (secondary to aspiration pneumonia), and dysphonia. Appendicular muscle weakness tends to
be more severe in the pelvic limbs in dogs, whereas this has not been reported in cats. Cats may
frequently demonstrate cervical ventroflexion as a clinical sign of generalized weakncs in some
cases, such cats may prefer to remain in thoracic recumbency with their heads supportcd on their
degree atrioventricular block has been reported to occur concurrently with MG in the dog. Cardiac
involvement in MG is well documented in human medicine and may be the result of autoantibodies
dirccted against the conducting tissue of the heart or a result of secondary focal myocarditis.
Acute fulminating MG is a severe and rapidly progresing form of generalized MG. Affected
animals demonstrate rapid progression of appendicular muscle weakness and may present nonambu-
latory in lateral recumbency. Weakness of the skeletal muscles eventually affects the intercostal
muscles and/or diaphragm, at which stage affected animals demonstrate severe respiratory distress.
Due to the concurrent pharyngeal and laryngeal muscle weakness, aspiration pneumonia is a fre-
quent complication in recumbent patients and the prognosis is therefore poor. Furthermore, for

Trust,UK)
successful treatment, these cases require rapid recognition and intensive care,including respiratory
supportive care and possibly plasmapheresis. The prevalence of acute fulminating MG in dogs and
cats has been reported as 16% and 15%, respectively.
3. Disorders that may mimic MG include other disorders of the NMJ as well as diseases presenting
with generalized or focal weakness of striated muscle.The most important differential diagnoses to
consider include the following:
Other disorders of the NMJ, in particular botulism, snake envenomation, tick paralysis, and
cholinesterase toxicity
Neuropathies and myopathies (particularly inflammatory and breed-related myopathies)
The diagnostic approach to the MG case is challenging, as historical and clinical signs of
dysfunction may be caused by a variety of other diseases, including diseases of the peripheral nervous
system, NMJ, and muscle. Some of the tests for MG are supportive, but not diagnostic, whereas
others may require general anesthesia. The clinician needs to be aware of the limitations of the
available tests in order to make a diagnosis as quickly as possible without detriment to the patient.
a.Minimum database
In every patient presenting with clinical signs of suspected MG, a minimum database,
including a complete blood count, biochemistry panel, and urinalysis, should be performed to
rule out other causes of generalized or focal weakness. Additionally, problems might be identified
on the minimum database that require intervention, particularly in animals demonstrating
dysphagia or megaesophagus who may have complications secondary to compromised fuid or
nutritional intake. Further endocrine testing, particularly of thyroid and adrenal function, may
be indicated based on the presenting clinical signs and findings on the minimum database.
Although myopathies are one of the most important differential diagnoses for MG, care must be
taken when interpreting muscle enzyme levels,particularly in animals that have been recumbent
for a prolonged length of time; recumbency and mild to moderate muscle damage (e.g., an
526

pneumonia.(Courtesy ofDr.PeterScrivani)
intramuscular injection,falling down) may result in moderate elevations of the creatine kinase
(CK) level in the absence of substantial muscle damage.
b.Imaging studies
Thoracic radiographs should be obtained to evaluate for the presence of megaesophagus
(preferably unsedated, as both sedation and anesthesia can induce an apparent megaesophagus in
normal animals). Megaesophagus is a frequent finding in dogs with MG and is often associated
with the presence of aspiration pneumonia (Fig. 16.6). In cats, megaesophagus is less common,
but its presence may indicate a more guarded prognosis. In cases with a historical suggestion of
megaesophagus for which there is no evidence on thoracic radiographs, esophagography with
liquid barium and fuoroscopy has been suggested. However, MG patients with poor pharyngeal
and esophageal function are at a greater risk of aspiration pneumonia, and the aspiration of
barium could dramaticaly exacerbate aspiration pneumonia. A safer alternative to a barium
csophagram is esophageal scintigraphy.Esophageal scintigraphy is safe and easily performed; this
 procedure also provides objective information pertaining to esophageal function.
Thymoma has been associated with acquired MG in human, canine, and feline patients. The
presence or absence of a cranial mediastinal mass should therefore be assessed with radiography
(and ultrasonography if indicated). Such masses are only occasionally present (3.4%, in one
study) in canine patients with acquired MG (Fig. 16.7). In feline acquired MG, however, the
incidence of a cranial mediastinal mass has been reported to be between 15% and 25.7%. The
absence of a radiographically demonstrable cranial mediastinal mass does not rule out the
possibility of a thymoma. Further imaging, including computed tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging, is often helpful in human medicine to evaluate the anterior mediastinum.

An electrocardiogram should be performed (particularly if bradycardia is present) to rule out
third-degree heart block.
c.Edrophonium chloride challenge (Tensilon response) test
To support the presumptive diagnosis of MG, an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon or
Camsilon; Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ) challenge test may be performed in animals demon-
strating muscular weakness. Edrophonium chloride is an ultra-short-acting anticholinesterase
agent, prolonging the residence time of ACh in the synaptic cleft and thereby improving muscle
strength where NMJ blockade is present. A positive response to an intravenous injection of
edrophonium chloride is supportive of a presumptive diagnosis of MG.An intravenous catheter
is placed prior to the challenge test. In dogs, 0.1-0.2 mg/kg is administered intravenously
immediately after exercise-induced weakness.In cats demonstrating muscular weakness, a dose of
0.25-0.50 mg per cat is administered intravenously, after which the patient is observed for
evidence of increased muscular activity. A positive response is one in which there is a dramatic
increase in muscle strength; this improvement is usually maintained for only a few minutes.
Although edrophonium chloride is relatively safe as a diagnostic agent (due to its short duration
ofaction), atropine should stillbe available in case acholinergiccrisis is inducedThe disadvantages
of using edrophonium chloride are primarily the possibility of both false positive and negative
results,and this test is therefore used only as a guide to revealing the presence of MG. Other
disorders causing NMJ block may also demonstrate a partial response to edrophonium chloride,
and in those MG patients with insufficient available ACh receptors, an inapparent or small response
may be evident, despite prolonging the residence time of the ACh. The results of the test are also
subjective and depend on the assessment and interpretation of the examiner.
528
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
In focal MG, particularly in cats, there is often no detectable improvement in muscular
strength and the test is of little use. An exception to this would be a focal MG case with a
decremental palpebral response. Such patients often demonstrate an improvement in the palpe-
nium chloride, which make it a safe and suitable diagnostic tool, may also make it unsuitable in
those cases that either have very brief collapse episodes or are difficult to administer intravenous
agents to during a collapse episode. In these cases the use of a longer-acting anticholinesterase
exercised to see if the wealkness cpisodes can be abolished or improved. Due to the long-acting
nature of neostigmine, prior atropinization is recommended to prevent a cholincrgic crisis. The
main risk during administration of any anticholinestcrasc agent is that of inducing a cholinergic
crisis. Overstimulation of muscarinic ACh receptors can result in adverse side effects including
bronchoconstriction and bradycardia. These can be prevented by pretreatment with antimusca-
rinic agents, either by administering subcutaneously or intramuscularly atropine (at 0.02 to
0.04 mg/kg) or glycopyrrolate (at 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg). Overstimulation of nicotinic ACh
receptors can induce a depolarizing blockade and exacerbate muscular weakness. The clinician
paralysisoccurs.
d.Electrodiagnostic assessment
Electrodiagnostic assessment is often useful in the diagnosis of MG, but it is limited by the
availability of the equipment and the requirement for generalized anesthesia (which may be
contraindicated in cases with respiratory impairment due to muscular weakness or aspiration
pneumonia).
e.
Repetitive nerve stimulation
The repetitive nervc stimulation test utilizes the area or amplitude of successive compound
muscle action potentials (CMAP) obtained by repctitivcly stimulating the nerve supplying that
muscle.The tibial, peroneal, or ulnar nerves are usually used,with the recording electrodes
placed in the digit innervated by that particular nerve.In the normal animal,the amplitude
should remain constant at stimulation rates of 5 or less per second. A decremental response to
repetitive nerve stimulation at a stimulation rate of 5/sec or less is supportive of a diagnosis of
MG (Fig. 16.8). A decrease in the CAMP of 10% or more is considered abnormal. At higher
stimulation rates, normal animals will often demonstrate a decreimental response. The test is
highly sensitive for MG in human patients, although the test is more likely to yield a positive
response in cases with generalized MG than focal MG. Reperitive nerve stimulation in focal MG
is still more sensitive than determining serum ACh rcceptor antibody concentrations in human

529
cases with focal MG. Some other NMJ disorders (e.g., organophosphate toxicity) rmay also
demonstrate a decremental response.
f. Single-fiber electromyography
A more specific test. for NMJ blockade induced by MG, in both dogs and man, is single
fiber electromyography (SF-EMG). The use of SF-EMG is limited at present due to the availabil-
ity and cost of the recording needles, as well as expertise required to perform the test. Single-fiber
EMG is based on obtaining rccordings of the evoked action potential from single muscle fibers
using a special recording needle with a very smallrecording surface. This is in contrast to the
conventional recording needles that record motor unit action potentials, which represent the
synchronous depolarization of many adjacent muscle fibers. Based on the recording of the evoked
action potential from one muscle fiber, the timevariation in neuromuscular transmissionfor that
fiber (jitter) can be determined. The test is based on the fact that the time variation for neuro-
muscular transmission (or latency from stimulus to action potential) is virtually constant for that
muscle fiber with repeated measurements. Any alteration in NMJ transmission is likely to result
in increased variation in the time of NMJ transmission. The test can be performed by one of two
methods:
The latency from the time of stimulus to the peak of an action potential for a single muscle
fiber can be recorded repeatedly. The jitter value is then calculated by determining the mean
value of the consecutive differences in latency (Fig. 16.9). In normal patients, the latency is
virtually constant.

APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
The interval between the evoked action potentials for two different muscle fibers from the
same motor unit (interposital latency) can be measured repeatedly. The jitter value is the
mean value of the consecutive differences in interposital latency.
The test is not specific for MG,as any disorder of NMJ transmission may result in an
abnormal jitter result.However, the main contribution to jitter is impulse conduction at the
synaptic cleft-end plate region of the NMJ, and in human medicine this test is therefore consid-
cred to be the most sensitive for detecting generalized MG and is stillvery sensitive in focal
forms. A method for determining jitter has been reported in dogs, but use of the test in the
diagnosis of MG has not been reported in veterinary practice to date.
g. Demonstration of elevated anti-ACh receptor antibody concentrations
The definitive diagnosis for acquired MG is made by demonstrating circulating antibodies
directed against nicotinic ACh receptors of skeletal muscle, with the highest antibody concentra-
tions generally occurring in cases with acute fulminating MG. Congenital MG will have a
negative antibody concentration. The test is an immunoprecipitation radioimmunoassay using
from near-term fetal canine muscle. The test is available for dogs and cats at the Comparative
Neuromuscular Laboratory, University of California, San Diego (Basic Science Building, Room
1057, La Jolla, CA 92093-0612). An ACh receptor antibody concentration of greater than
0.30 nmol/l is positive for acquired MG in cats, while greater than 0.6 nmol/l is positive in dogs.
False-positivc tests are extremely rare, and a positive result is therefore virtually confirmatory for
sive. The serum ACh receptor antibody concentration is usually lowest in cases with focal MG
and highest in cases with acute fulminating MG, although a statistically significant correlation
between antibodylevel anddiseaseseverityhasnotbccnconfirmed
In human MG, the immunoprecipitation radioimmunoassay fails to detect 10% to 15% of
 generalized MG cases and 30% to 50% of focal MG cases, with thesc patients being referred t0
as seronegative myasthenics. There is evidence that this situation also occurs in canine patients
with acquired MG. The proposed reasons for the failure of this technique to detect some cases
include thefollowing:
In some cases, the affnity of the antibody is such that all of the available antibody is bound
to the muscle end plate region with undetectable Ievels of circulating antibody.
epitopes of the ACh receptor may occur, and the test probe may therefore fail to recognize
some antigenic variations of the ACh receptor antibodies.
Some of the antibodies in acquired MG may be directed against antigenic proteins of the end
plate region other than the ACh receptors, and these would therefore not be identified by the
test.
Prior treatment with immunosuppressive agents may decrease the possibility of obtaining a
positive titer.
h.Demonstration of immunoglobulin localized to the end plate region of muscle
Supportive of the diagnosis (but not specific for acquired MG), immune complexes may be
demonstratcd at the levcl of the NMJ by immunocytochemistry of fresh muscle biopsy speci-
mens or by incubating the patient's serum with stored normal canine muscle samples. The test is
relatively inexpensive and easy to perform, but the Staphylococcal protein A-horseradish peroxi-
dase conjugate is not specific to antibodics against the ACh receptors, and the test is therefore
not specific for acquired MG. The test is, however, a useful screening tool as a negative result
16/JUNCTIONOPATHIES:DISORDERSOFTHENEUROMUSCULARJUNCTION
531
generally rules out the possibility of acquired MG. Pretreatment with immunosuppressive drugs
may decrease the chance of a positive test.
4. Treatment of MG can be subdivided into supportive treatment, which is similar for all cases with
neuromuscular blockade, and specific therapy aimed at relieving the NMJ blockade and controlling
the underlying autoimmune process in acquired MG.
a. Supportive treatment
(1)Aspiration pneumonia
Prevention and/or treatment of aspiration pneumonia is important due to the increased
morbidity and mortality associated with its development. Recumbent patients should be
turned frequently (every 2 to 4 hours) to prevent hypostatic lung edema and exacerbation of
any existing pneumonia. If aspiration pneumonia is present, or the development thereof is
thought to be likely, thcn antibiotic therapy should be implemented. Ideally, the choice of
antibiotic should be based on culture and sensitivity tcst results from tracheal wash fuid and
should be tailored to avoid using antibiotics associated with NMJ blockade. Frequent nebuli-
zation and coupage are useful in the treatment of pneumonia.
(2) Fluid requirements
The maintenance of hydration in the face of significant regurgitation can be a challenge,
especially as some animals tend to regurgitate liquids more readily than solids. Maintenance
of fuid requirements with intravenous fuid therapy should be initiated if required.
(3) Nutritional support
Maintenance of dietary intake is important in recumbent patients and particularly those
with dysphagia or regurgitation. Elevated feeding may help in some cases with megaesopha-
gus, but maintaining head elevation is difficult in cats. In those patients in which elevated
feeding is undertaken, determining the ideal food consistency for that individual case is a
matter of trial and error. Solid food stimulates pharyngeal and esophageal peristalsis more
effectively in the normal dog, but some dogs with pharyngeal and esophageal dysfunction
tolerate semisolid food better.The head should bemaintained elevated throughout fecding
and for 10-15 minutes following feeding. In those cascs with unmanageable regurgitation,
esophageal function, regurgitation can still occur with a nasogastric or pharyngostomy tube,
and a gastrostomy tube would be better suited to MG patients. The advantages of gastros-
tomy tube placement include that head elevation during feeding is no longer required, the
risk of aspiration pneumonia is reduced, and proper delivery of oral medication can be
guaranteed (versus variable delivery and passage time with megaesophagus and dysphagia).
The disadvantages of gastrostomy tube placement are that only semiliquid and liquid foods
can be administered and that tube placement requires a short general anesthetic that may be
deleterious to some myasthenics.

(5) Drugs to modify gastrointestinal tract function
The main consideration in the manipulation of gastrointestinal tract (Gl'l) function in
MG is the management of megaesophagus and dysphagia, with the resulrant complications of
regurgitation, esophagitis, and aspiration pneumonia.
(a) Improving esophageal motility
Drugs with prokinetic effects on GIT' smooth muscle include metoclopramide and
cisapride. Both of these drugs are believed to mediate their prokinetic effect by stimulat-
ing enteric cholinergic neurons, which in turn leads to ACh release and resultant smooth-
muscle contraction. There is, however, no evidence that either of these two drugs
532
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
stimulate increased esophageal motility in either the normal or MG-affected canine
esophagus. Cisapride has accually been demonstrated to increase esophageal transit time
in the normal dog. The dose of metoclopramide in the dog is 0.2-0.5 mg/kg given orally,
intramuscularly, or subcutaneously cvery 8 hours and that of cisapride is 0.1-0.5 mg/kg
given orally every 8 hours.
(b) Increasing lower esophageal sphincter tone
Where elevated oral fccding is being used, drugs that increase lower esophageal tone
should be avoided as this would result in resistance to the passage of food into the
stomach. Increased lower esophageal tone would be beneficial where feeding is being
performed via a gastrostomy tube by decrcasing gastrocsophageal refux and consequently
reducing or limiting esophagitis. Both metoclopramidc and cisapride increase lower
esophageal tone, with cisapride having the more potent action.
(c) Prevention and management of esophagitis
Animals with megacsophagus and gastic refux into the esophagus are at risk of
dcvcloping esophagitis, which. may in itself perpetuate esophageal dilation. The risk of
csophagitis (or management thereof where esophagitis is already present) can be decreased
by feeding via a gastrostomy tube (combined with drugs to increase lower esophageal
sphincter resistance) and by increasing the pH of GI'I' content.
(d) Increasing the pH of gastrointestinal tract content
The acidity of aspirated rmaterial is a major determinant of the degree of pulmonary
damage in aspiration pneumonia as well as contributing to the severity of esophagitis. A
frequent component of aspirated material in MG is refuxed gastric content; increasing
the gastric content pH is therefore advisable in MG cases at risk of aspiration pneumonia.
Cimetidine and ranitidinc are both histamine-2 receptor antagonists that incrcase gastric
content pH (with ranitidine being more effective). Cimetidine is administered at 5
10 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours, and ranitidine is adininistered at 0.5-to 2.0 mg/kg every 12
hours. Both agents can be administered by the oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and
intravenous routes.
b. Specific therapy
The mainstay of specific therapy in MG is the use of anticholinesterase agents, although an
attempt should also be made to adress the underlying disease process by immunomodulatory
therapy and adressing any contriburory disease processes.
(1) Anticholinesterase therapy
Anticholinesterasc drugs prolong the availability of ACh for binding to ACh receprors by
inhibiting degradation by ACh esterase. Pyridostigminc bromide (Mestinon; ICN) is admin-
istered orally every 8--12 hours at a dosc of 0.5-3.0 mg/kg in dogs and 0.25 rng/kg in cats.
Pyridostigmine bromide is available in both rablet and syrup forim. A slow-release tabler form
is available, but the gastrointestinal absorption may be erratic. Cats arc more sensitive than
dogs to anticholinesterase drugs, and the starting dose is therefore lower than in dogs; carc
should also bc taken when altering the dose in cats. The dose should be started at the lower
cnd of the scalc and slowly titrated to achieve the best clinical response while avoiding
cholinergic side effecrs, Cholinergic signs include hypersalivation, vomiting. and muscle
fasciculations. Should these signs develop, the dose should be decreased.
If oral medication cannot be tolerated due to pharyngeal weakness or aspiration pneumo-
nia, then either administration of pyridostigmine by gastrostorny tube if one has been
placed) or parenteral neostigmine (Prostigmin; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) may
be considered until oral pyridostigmine administrarion can be tolerated. 'T'he onset of effect
for parenteral neostigmine is rnore rapid, but of shorter duration than pyridostigmine, and it
therefore needs to be administered cvcry 6 hours. In dogs it can be administered at a dose of
0.04 mg/kg.
16/ JUNCTIONOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION
533
Therc is some variabiliry in thc response to anticholinesterase therapy, and the reason for
this variability is poorly understood. Certainly, in hurnan patients with acquired MG, most
cases are not satisfactorily controlled with anticholinesterase therapy alone, and these drugs
are often ineffectivc in controlling the ocular form of the disease. Some dogs appear to
respond well to therapy while others are poorly responsive. To some extent, the variability in
the severity of the autoimmune response against the ACh rcceptors may cxplain thc variabil-
ity to anticholinesterase therapy as anticholincsterase therapy docs not address the underlying
autoimmune process.The effect of anticholinesterase therapy on improving esophageal
function in dogs with megaesophagus is thought to be less than the effect on appendictular
muscle wcakncss.
(2) Immunosupprcssive therapy
The use of immunosuppressive therapy in acquired MG is based on the underlying
pathophysiology, an autoimmune destruction of functional ACh receptors. There is, however,
some controversy about the use of immunosuppressive therapy in MG, with rhe main reasons
being the high incidence of aspiration pneumonia in MG (especially in canine patienrs), with
the potential for immunosuppressive therapy to exacerbate that, as well as the potential for
glucocorticoid therapy to worsen neuromuscular wcakncss.
(3) Glucocorticoid therapy
The potential for glucocorricoid thcrapy to exacerbate muscular weakness has been
demonstrated in both dogs and cats, cspecially in cases with marked muscular weakness and
respiratory distrcss. Increased muscle weakness associated with glucocorricoid therapy has
been observed in 50% of human MG patients, as well as in dogs and cats. In one study of
myasthenic cats, however, there was no demonstrable muscular weakness associated with
glucocorticoid therapy Some dogs (especially in the young agc group) may go into spontane-
ous remission, ever without immunosuppressive therapy In cases responsive to edrophonium
chloride, a conservative treatrment regime would be to start pyridostigminc hromide therapy.
combined with alternate-day low-dose (anti-infammatory dose) prednisone therapy. Increas-
ing (or in naive cases, introducing) corticosteroid therapy should be considered if che
responsc to anticholinesterase therapy is suboptimal or if the animal is denonstrating resis-
tance to the drug therapy. An initial dosage of 0.5 mg/kg body weight, every 12 hours is
suggested in these cascs, as higher doses Imay result in exacerbation of neuromuscular wcak-
ness. In cals, prednisone doses of 1-4 mg/kg/day have bcen used and dexamethasonc at
0.25-2.0 1ng/kg/day. Dexanethasone is associated with morc gastrointcstinal side effects and
a higher myopathic potential than prednisone, thus its use should therefore be avoided in
MG, Thc exact mechanism whercby prednisone results in inprovement of the clinical signs
of MG is not fully understood, but it may be related to inhibitory effects of prednisone on
the formation and rclcasc of infammatory agenrs, lymphocyte division, lymphocyte reactivity
to ACh receptors, and lcukocyte chemotaxis.
(a)Azathioprine
Azathioprine is a cytotoxic antimetabolite that interferes with DNA synthesis, with
cyte numbers and consequently inmunoglobulin production, as well as specifcally
inhibiting T cell production. The use of azathioprine alonc or combincd with prednisone
has been denmonstrated to be highly effcctive in resolving clinical signs in human MG.
Potential side effects of azathioprinc thcrapy include the development of bone marrow
suppression and, less often, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and GrT irritation. Bone marrow
supprcssion is much more common in cats, and azathioprine use is therefore not advised
in this specics.
In dogs with cvidcnce of bone marrow supprcssion (leukopenia with or without
anemia and thrombocytopenia), azathioprinc therapy should be discontinucd (or reduced
534
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINEAND FELINE NEUROLOGY
in cases with mild bone marrow suppression). It is recommended that azathioprine be
discontinued if the patient's white blood cel count is less than 4000 cells/ml and/or if the
neutrophil count is below 1o00 cells/ml. Thc onsct of clinical effect of azathioprine is
delayed in both human cases and in dogs, and its use should therefore be combined with
prednisone if an early effect is required. A conservative prednisone dose should be used
initially, as discussed earlier. Thc clinical signs should abate rapidly with prednisone
therapy. After 2 months, the prednisone therapy can be rapered to a minimum altcr-
nate-day dosage, or in some cases, stopped entirely.This protocol should minimize side
effects with rapid and sustained control of the clinical signs in many patients. In stable
MG dogs, azathioprine may be considercd as a sole immunosuppressive agent. It may
take several weeks before an obvious clinical benefit is rcalized in sich patients. The dose
of azathioprine in dogs is 2 ng/kg body weight, divided into two daily doses 12 hours
hemograin every 1-2 wccks during the initial 1-2 months of therapy and cvcry 1-2
months thercaftcr.
(b) Cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide
Both cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide have been demonstrated to have some
efficacy in human cases of acquired MG. In one report, cyclosporine was successful in the
treatment of two dogs with acquired MG at a dosage of 4 mg/kg body weight, every 12
hours. Although its specificity for lymphocytes is an attractive feature, cyclosporine is
extremely expensive. Cyclophosphamide is associated with more frequent and more severe
side effects in cornparison with other immunosupprcssivc drugs.
(c) Mycophenolate mofetil
 Successfiul treatment of a dog with MG with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (Cell-
Cept; Roche Pharmaceuricals, Nuley, N), an immunosuppressive cdrug with rclativc
specificity for lymphocytes, has been reported. Institution of MMF therapy resulted in
rapid resolution of clinical signs (within the first week of therapy) and return of the ACh
receptor antibody concentration to within the normal range. The initial oral (or gastros-
tomy tube) dose of MMF is 20 mg/kg body weight, every 12 hours. Side effecrs of MMF
in dogs are primarily gastrointestinal (c.g., vomiting, bloody diarzhea). It is recommended
that the MMl dose be reduced by half once clinical signs of MG improve substantially
or rcsolve in order to minimizc adverse side effects. Since side cffects are typically evident
by 34 weeks of therapy with MMF, reducing the dose prior to this time is recom-
 mended, cspecially if a positive clinical response has already been achieved.
(4) Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis
been demonstrated to be effective, although short-term, treatments for human acquired MG,
particularly in acute fulminating MG where rapid improvement in the clinical signs is
rcquircd. These techniques are limited in veterinary medicine due to thc cost limitations and
equipment requiremcnts, but they may be of benefit in the management of acute fulminating
MG.
The mode of action of intravenous immunoglobulin is poorly understood but may be
related to binding of circulating autoantibodies, blocking rmacrophage and lymphocyte Fc
receptors, enhanced suppressor T cell activity, and inhibition of the complement cascade.
This therapy has been shown to be useful in the managernent of human acquired MG with
few side effects but has not been assessed in the managenent of canine acquired MG.
Plasmapheresis involves removing the plasma and plasma constituents (including immu-
noglobulins) from whole blood of patients and rcturning the blood elements with either
stored plasma or plasma substitutes to the patients. Immunoadsorption therapy is a forim of
plasmapheresis in which a patient's plasma is rerurned after bcing passed through a fiter that
16 / JUNCTIONOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION
535
from circulation and has been shown to be effective with few side effects in human MG cases
and in one dog with acquired MG, where its use was combined with prednisone therapy.
(5) Therapeutic vaccines
Peptides that mimic antigen receptors of T and B clls ncccssary for generation and
maintcnance of the autoimmune responsc in acquired MG have hccn cvaluatcd as thcrapcutic
vaccincs in both a rar model and naturally occurring canine-acquired MG. Thcse peptides
lead to the production of ancrgizing antibodies against AChR-specific receptors on. these
immune cells, blunting thc autoimmune response. Although the data is preliminary, this
approach appears to have been effective in a small number of dogs (10) evaluated. These 10
vaccinated dogs experienced a higher rate and shorter time to clinical and serologic remission
when compared with historical controls.
c.Maniagement of cancurrent neoplasia
If a concurrent thymic mass or other neoplasia is present, then surgery (with or without
radiation therapy) should be considered. Removal of thymic hyperplasia hias been demonstrated
to improve remission rates in human patients with acquired MG. In contrast to the removal of
associated with an improvement in clinical signs, Occasionally, a myasthenic person will worscn
following thymona removal. The improvement documented in human cases with thymic
while the worseniug of the clinical. signs occasionally seen in acquired MG following thymoma
removal rmay be related to the loss of an immunosuppressive effect of the thymus.
The beneficial effect of thymic renoval in the ahscnce of a thymoma has not been demon-
stratcd in dogs and cats. Thymic hyperplasia has also not been described in dogs and cats with
MG, and thymectomy in the absence of a demonstrable thymic mass would not be recom-
mended due to the detrinental and stressful effects of surgcry and anesthesia In the few docu-
mented cascs in which thymoma was performed in dogs with. acquired MG, the outcomc was
generaly poor, with all cases presenting with imegaesophagus and the majority dying of aspiration.
pneumonia shortly after surgery. It may therefore be prudent to avoid thymoma removal in
myasthenic dogs or at least dclay surgery until the clinical signs have first been adequately
controlled with medical management. Successful management of thymoina with radiation
therapy has been repored in a dog.
5.Trcatmcnt of acute fulminating myasthenia gravis
The morrality associated with MG is highcst with the fulminating form, although forrunately
this is the most uncommon form of the discasc. Cases presenr with rapidly progressive generalized
weakness; rapid diagnosis and treatment (combining anticholinesterase therapy and ventilatory
support) are therefore esscntial. The main cause of death in these cases is respiratory failure second-
ary to muscular weakness, and this may be further complicated by aspiration pneumonia. Care
should be taken when initiating immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids due to the potential
to exacerbate the muscular wealkness. In human cases with acute fulminating MG, plasmapheresis
and intravenous immunoglobulin have been used, but their use in veterinary medicine is limited by
cost and availability.
a. Contraindications
Drugs that adversely afece NMJ transmission should be avoided, incuding ampicillin,
aminoglycoside antibiotics,anti-arrhythmic agents, phenothiazins, anesthetics, nacotics, and
muscle relaxants. Organophosphates may act in an additive manner with pyridostigmine, and
their concurrent use should therefore he avoided.
b. Prognosis
The overall prognosis for acquired MG in dogs is guarded due to this species' propensity to
develop megaesophagus and aspiration pneumonia. The prognosis for recovery from acquired

humans and the overall survival rate is thercfore lower than human. patients. The overall 1l-year
mortality rate for canine acquired MG has been reported to be bctwecn 40% and 60%. Ihe
rcason for dcath or euthanasia of myasthenic dogs is almost always severc or recurrerit aspiration
pneumonia. In order to maximize the chance of a favorable outcome in. caninc MG patients,
survival rate of dogs with acquired MG appears to have improved in recent years, perhaps due to
increased recognition and prompt diagnosis of the disorder, improved treatment options, or some
combination of these two. In addition, there is soime evidence that spontaneous remission of
Information on documented cases of acquired MG in cais suggests that the prognosis for
focal and generalized MG may be better than that reported for dogs. This is likely due to the
acquired MG in 20 cats, only 3 of the cats dicd and all 3 of these presented with acute fulrminal-
ing MG, with death due to respiratory failure. Of the remaining cars, 11 of 20 demonstrated
year follow-up was available for 5 cats, at which time 2 were still alive, while the other 3 cats had
died or were euthanizcd for unrelated illnesses. At 1.5 years, 2 cats were found to be frce of
clinical signs of the disease.
Clinical remission of MG is associated with a. return of serum ACh receptor antibody
concentrations to the normal range. These conccntrations should therefore be evaluated every
6o 8 wceks to monitor the clinical course of the disease.
V1.Drugs and Toxins Associated with Junctionopathies (sce Table 16.2)
A.Algae-derived toxins4.1629.30.92124125,111
1. Blue-green algae (anatoxins)
Anatoxin-a has been isolated from at least thiree genera of freshwater cyanobacteria (blue-grccn
algae) and has been dlemonstrated to be a bicyclic secondary amine. T he offending blue-grcen algae
genera include Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, and Oscilltoria. Anatoxin-a(s) has been isolated from
Anabaena fos-aquae, which is distinct from thc Anabaena strains that produce anatoxin-a. Anatoxin-
a(s) is a naturally produced organophosphate thar has been responsible for a variety of animal
poisonings, including dogs. Anatoxin-a(s) has been demonstrated to be a potent irreversible inhibitor
of ACh in experimental studics, and certainly the inhibitory kinetics of anatoxin-a(s) are supporrive
of an in vivo anticholinesterase action. Anatoxin-a(s) toxicity can be reversed by trcatmcnt as for
cholinesterase toxicity, including the use of oxime reactivators, carbamates, and atropinc.
2.Green algae (charatoxin)
Charatoxin is produced by the alga Chara globularis, which has been shown to be an insecticidal
agent. In high concentrarions, it is a competitive antagonist at the nicotinic ACh receptor, while at
lower concentralions it enhances ACh binding.
Antibiotics causing NMJ blockade are unusual in vererinary medicine, but the undlerstanding of the few
Ieported cascs is augmented by the large amount of cxperimenral data. Onc of the most imporant areas of
concern is the concurrent use of these antibiotics and anesthesia incorporating NMj-blocking agents or in
animals with concurrenr MG. Certainly, gentamycin has been shown co augment the neuromuscular
blockade of atracurium in anesthetized horses. Antibiotics with demonstrated NMj-blocking effects include

APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
1.Aminoglycoside antibiotics
The aminoglycoside family of antibiotics is primarily used to treat infections from acrobic gram-
negative bacteria. These drugs act in a bactericidal manner by interfering with protein synthesis. The
family includes gentamycin, neornycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin, amikacin, and
netilmycin. The primary lirnitations for the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics are the development of
ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, but acute neuromuscular blockade has bcen reported, particularly
when aminoglycoside antibiotics are used in conjunctionwith generalanesthesia.
The toxic mechanism for the acute, reversible NMJ blockade induced by aminoglycoside
antibiotics appcars to be mediated via calcium antagonism at the external cell membrane channel
sites on both the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell membrane. The NMJ blockade induced by
aminoglycoside antibiotics is transient and experimentally is virtually completely antagonized by
calcium and partially antagonized by neostigmine. All members of the aminoglycoside family can
cause NMJ blockade, but both the degree of NMJ blockade and the balance between pre- and
postsynaptic effects vary between the different agents. In order of decreasing effect of NMJ blockade
are neomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, gentamycin, and tobramycin.
Presynaptic inhibition of NMJ transmission by the inhibition of ACh release is a feature of all
aminoglycoside antibiotics.With gentamycin, the presynaptic NMJ blockade has been demonstrated
to be the result of extracellular blockade of calcium influx. Neomycin has been demonstrated to be
tic block of ACh release by neomycin is so predictable that it has been used experimentally to reverse
OG anticholinesterase-inducedNMJ blockade.
The difference between members of the aminoglycoside family lies in the varying dcgree of effect
on postsynaptic NMJ blockade, and this may in part be duc to the effect being mediated via two
different mechanisms. Neomycin displays significant postsynaptic NMj blockade by apparently
interacting with the ion channel receptor in the open configuration and is partially reversibleby
neostigmine. The effect of streptomycin on the postsynaptic NMJ is minimal and is mediated by
blocking the receptor, and neostigmine causes minimal reversal.
Reports of aminoglycoside toxicity causing NMJ blockade are limited in veterinary medicine and
are mainly made up of experimental studies, particularly in cats. One animal was reported that
developed severe muscle weakness and hyporeflexia following 5 days of gentamycin therapy for deep
pyoderma and in which the clinical signs resolved 48 hours after the antibiotic was withdrawn.The
onset of NMJ blockade is rapid, and in severe cases may progress from weakness to retraplegia with
respiratory paralysis within 4-6 hours. Reported aminoglycoside NMJ blockade in humans is most
common in thc presence of concomitant disease of the NMJ (e.g., MG) or concomitant administra-
predisposing factors. In human medicine, it appears that a high dose of aminoglycoside antibiotic is
not always required and that the duration of medication prior to the development of clinical signs is
variable. Certain predisposing factors that havc been recognized include the following:
The intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intrapleural routes of administration are more risk-prone,
as are high dose rates.
Impairment of renal excrction through renal disease or dehydration incrcases the risk.
。
 Some other disease states increase the risk, particularly gram-negative septicemia.
‘Treatment of aminoglycoside-induced NMJ blockade is by withdrawal of the antibiotic therapy,
which is usually followed by rapid recovery as the plasma aminoglycoside levels decline. In patients
with impaired renal function, fuid therapy may be required, In human patients, calcium chloride
and nieostigmine have been administered with variable success, usually in an attempt to reverse NMJ
blockade in emergency postanesthetic situations.
16 / JUNCTIONOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION
539
2. Lincomycin
Lincomycin is produced by an actinomycete, Streptomyces lincolnenis but has largely been
supplanted by clindamycin, which is more active and has fewer side cffects. The mechanism of
lincomycin acrion on the NMj probably involves both pre- and postsynaptic mcchanisms. There arc
largely confined to the potentiarion of effecrs of d-tubocurarine and pancuronium.
3.Penicillamine
Penicillamine is a degradation product of penicillin, and the D-isomer is an effective chelator
of copper, zinc, mercury, and lead. It is used in human medicine as a chelating agent for the treat-
ment of cysteinuria (by forming a saluble disulphide compound with cysteine) and for the suppres-
sion of rheumatoid arthritis. Penicillamine is not routinely used in veterinary medicine; however, in
human medicine the neurotoxic effects incdude the induction of MG and polyinyositis/
dermatomyositis.
 Penicillanmine induces MG in up to 7% of human patients and appcars to act by altering
the antigenic structure of the ACh receptor and subsequently initiating a new autoimmune
response.
4.Polymyxins
'The polymyxin antibiotics, comprising polymyxin B and polymyxin E, are microorganisn-
derived polypeptides that disrupt the structure of cell mermbranes and are effective against gram-
ncgativc bacteria. T'here is no absorption through mucous mcmbranes, and enteral administration
therefore docs not result in systenic effects. Following parenteral administration, polymyxins remain
largely unrmctabolized, with intact excretion occurring in the urine. Paticnts with rcnal compromise
are therefore parricularly susceptible to toxic effects. In human medicine, parenteral administration
of polymyxin at conventional dosc rates is associated with renal dysfunction in approximately 20%
of patients. The most significant neurologic toxic effect of polymyxin is NMJ blockade. In contrast
to the aminoglycoside antibiotics, thc primary effect is on the postsynaptic membrane in a nondepo-
larizing and noncomperitive manner. The postsynaptic NMj-blocking effect of polymyxin is also
more potent than thar induced by the aminoglycoside antibiotics and is not reversed by either
ncostigmine or calciurn chloride.
In an cxperimenral study in cats, the effects of ncormycin and polymyxin B were found to bc
additive in neuromuscular effects in both potency and duration of effect. The slight prcsynaptic
inhibition of transmirter release is partially reversible by calcium chloride. In human patients, the
primary clinical sign of polymyxin-induced NMj blockade is the sudden manifestation of apnea after
ade, including weakness, ptosis, and diplopia. The use of parenteral polynyxin is contraindicated in
 patients with concomitant MG. In veterinary medicine, polymyxin-induced NMJ blockade is
Iestricted to experimental studies, primarily in cats. Administration of 4-aminopyridine at 0.6 mg/kg
body weight has been reported to reverse the NMj-blocking effects of polyinyxin in both acute and
chronic toxicity studies in cats.
5. Tetracyclines
The tetracycline antibiotics were first isolated in 1948 from soil samplcs containing thc antibi-
otic-producing microbes, and since then semisynthetic and synthetic forms have been developed.
Tetracycline antibiorics are active against a large variety of organisms, including gram-positive and
gram-negative bacteria, chlamydia, and rickettsiae. The NMj-blocking effects of oxytetracycline and
methyl-pyrrolidino-tetracycline havc been demonstrated experimentally in the cat, in which intrave-
nous injecrion into the femoral vein leads to NMJ-blocking cffects in the ipsilateral pelvic limb. The
NMJ blockade could be reversed with prostigmine and parrially reverscd with calcium. In human
MG paricnts, transient weakness has been reported following the inrravcnous adminisrration of
tetracyclines. Proposed mechanisms for the NMJ blocking effect of tetracyclines include:
540
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
·chelation of serum calcium by tetracycline,
calcium antagonizing effects of the magnesium in the diluent, and
post-NMJ depression of muscle to the effect of ACh.
Tetracycline antibiotic therapy should therefore be avoided in myasthenic patients.
1.Chloroquine
Chloroquine is primarily used as an antimalarial agent, being effective against Plasmodium vivax
and Plasmodium falciparum; however, at high doses its use in human mcdicine includes the treat-
ment of rheumatoid arthritis and discoid lupus arthritis.In human medicine, chloroquine has been
reported to impair NMJ transmission and is contraindicated in patients with concurrent MG. In
experimental studies in animals, including cats, the primary toxic effect of chloroquine is the devel-
opment of a retinopathy, whereas in rats a vacuolar myopathy has been demonstrated.
2.Quinine
Quinine is derived from the bark of the cinchona tree and in human medicine is primarily used
in the treatment of chloroquine-resistant malaria, to relieve the symptoms of congenital myotonia,
and in the treacment of nocturnal leg cramps. Quinine has been shown to disrupt normal NMJ
transmission and may cause an exacerbation of the clinical signs in paticnts with MG. In experimen
tal studies in the cat, sublethal doses were associated with generalized loss of retinal ganglion cells
D. Black widow spider venom22.50.6,7-7,11714,19.15,159,197
The black widow spider (Lactrodectus spp.) is widespread around the world and includes the following:
° Lactrodectus tredecimguttatus: temperate areas of Europe and North Africa
·Lactrodectus mactans: warm areas of North, Central, and South America
· Lactrodectus geometricus: tropical Americas
The venom of the black widow spider has been shown to consist of a number of proteins with potent
neurotoxic effects. Purified fraction B (purified to a single peak: B5) or a-latrotoxin has been shown to be
the probable source of the majority of the clinical ncurotoxic effects in vertebrates. a-Latrotoxin does not
cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore exerts irs effects on peripheral NMJ and autonomic synapses.
The toxin acts by causing potent activation of neurotransmitter release and loss of synaptic vesicles, followed
by depletion of neurotransmitter and conduction block. The primary mechanism behind this process
appears to be by the promotion of docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and
furthermore by inhibiting membrane recycling and blocking the production of new synaptic vesicles. Black
widow spider venom reverses botulinum toxin-induced blockade of synaptic transmission. Additionally,
intramuscular injection of black widow spider toxin results in degeneration of botulinum-blocked
5days.
Clinical signs of black widow spider envenomation in human medicine are a reflection of hyperactiva
tion of motor, sensory, and autonomic sympathetic systems. The motor clinical signs include tremor,
spasmodic leg movements, and clonic muscle contractions. This is followed by the development of faccid
abdominal pain and rigidity. Salivation, lacrimation, sweating, and tachycardia frcquently accompany these
clinical signs. Reports of veterinary black widow spider envenomation are rare, but have been recognized for
a number of years. lt has been reported that the cat appears more susceptible to black widow spider enven-
omation. In one report of apparent envenomation in a cat, the presenting clinical signs were very similar to
those seen in human medicine. The affected cat demonstrated progression from fine-muscle tremors,
541
muscular spasticity, abdominal pain with a rigid abdomen, and an increased respiratory rate to profound
muscle weakness and Haccidiry. Elecrrolyte disturbances in the case included a profound hypocalcemia and
hypokalenia. Within 2 hours of antivenin administration, a clinical improvement characterized by an
inprovement in respiratory function and a return to sternal recumbency was evident.
Treatment of black widow spider envenomation is based on administration of antivcnin and correction
of elcctrolyte disturbances, particularly any existing hypocalcemia. As the antivenin is cquine derived,
sensitivity testing by administering a small intradermal test dose prior to administering the parenteral dose is
csscntial. A rapid response is usually seen following administration of the antivenin. In human medicine, the
clinical signs associated with untreated spider bitcs usually subside after 4872hours. Further supportive
potential for cardiovascular arrest in young or elderly patients in human medicine, consideration should bc
 given to blod pressure monitoring in veterinary cases.

1.Botulism is the term used ro describe the discase caused as a result of ingestion of preformed Clos-
tridium botulinum cxotoxin. Botulism toxin is one of the most potent known toxins. The usual cause
of botulism is ingestion of toxin in uncooked and spoiled food (in dogs, most frequently raw meat)
or carrion, but in rare cases botulism may occur as a result of GIT formation of botulism toxin
secondary to colonization of the GIT tract with the “toxico-infectious' form of C. botulinum.
Preferential colonization sires for C. bonulinum appear to be the Gll' and liver wounds (ulcers and
abscesses).
Eight rypes of botulinum toxin have been identifed based on differing antigenic propcrtics,
including A, B, C, C, D, E, F, and G. The majority of human cascs are associated with types A, B,
and E, while in veterinary medicine most cases are caused by types C and D. In dogs, the most
common toxin associatcd with clinical disease is type-C, although two cases of type-D intoxication
have been reporred from Senegal. Type-C, botulinum toxin is not considered to be neurotoxic,
although it may alter vascular permeability. Botulism is uncommon in the dog, while in cats no
naturally occurring cases have been reported; however, the disease has been experimentally repro-
duced in cats. Type-C botulism has been reported in lions. The botulinum toxins are serologically
distinct, but the majority result in similar neurotoxic effects.
Ihe main effect of botulinun toxin is to block the release of ACh at the level of the NMJ and
at cholinergic autonomic synapses. This results in thc development of Haccid paralysis and alterations
small intestine following ingestion of food containing the preformed toxin (or local production in
the toxico-infectious form). Iype-E toxin appears to be activated and madle more potent by the
proteolytic enzymes in the upper GIT, although in the other toxin types there is evidence that somc
of the toxin does get denatured. Toxin passing through to the lower GIT demonstrates lower absorp-
tion efficiency Once absorbed, the toxin passes into thc general circulation, where it circulares to
cholinergic synapses in the peripheral nervous system, including the NMJ, foflowed by binding of
the toxin to receptor molecules on the external surface of the cel membrane. The receptor is postu-
latcd to be sialic acid to which rapid bindings occurs, independent of neural activity and tempera-
ture. The toxin is then internalized into the nerve terminal within a vesicle. Internalized toxin is not
accessible to neutralization by antitoxin. The toxin inhibits neurotransmitter release by cleaving the
proteins required for neurotransmier exocytosis.

conscionsness are uinaffected. Distinct from other causes of diffuse lower motor neuron signs, with
botulism there is frequently additional cvidence of cranial nerve deficits (e.g., facial nerve paralysis,
depressed gag refex, decreased jaw tonc, and megaesophagus) and occasional evidence of dysfunction
of the cholinergic neurons of thc autonomic nervous system. The cholinergic signs include altera-
reflexes), keratoconjunctivitis sicca, urinary retention, and constipation.
3. Diagnosis of botulism is primarily based on the history and suggestive clinical presentation. Due to
the dietary origin of the toxin, multiple cases may occur in some situations. Routine laboratory
analysis is usually unremarkable, and the definitive diagnosis is based on the denmonstration of
botulinum toxin early in the course of the disease, cithcr in blood (10 ml of serum should be
collected) or GIT contents (50 g of feces, vomitus, or food sample should be collected). It is essential
to discuss the diagnostic sample requirements with the laboratory performing the investigation.
Electrodiagnostic evaluation may assist in the diagnosis, but is not definitivc. Affected cascs may
demonstrate decreased amplitude of compound evoked muscle action potentials. Repctitive nerve
stinulation ar low-frcquency rates (c.g., less than 5/sec) may produce a simall decrement in com-
pound muscle action potentials; rapid rates (e.g., 50/sec) are likely to produce an increment in
successive compound muscle action potentials. Electromyography may demonstrate fibrillation
potentials and positive sharp waves after 7-10 days of paralysis. Motor nerve conduction velocity
may be clecreased but is usually umaffected.
4.Treatmnent of botulism toxicity is largely supportive as toxin internalized into the ncrvous system is

decreased gag reflex, spccial care must be taken to minimize the potential for the development of
aspiration pneumonia, in the event of which prompt antibiotic therapy, combined with coupage and
nebulization, should be initiated. Antibiotics with the potential to interfere with NMJ transmission
should be avoided (e.g., arninoglycosides).
Due to the potential for autonomic dysfunction, close attention should bc paid to bladder and
bowel function, with suitable intervention. if required. Botulism toxicity is the result of ingestion of
prcformed toxin, and covering antibiotic therapy is therefore not indicated in the absence of second-
ary bacterial jnfections. Due to the relative inaccessibility of the bound botulinum toxin, administra-
tion of antitoxin (if available) should only be considered in severe cases and if toxin exposure
occurred relatively recently (within 5 days), and then only following a negative response to an
intradermal test dose to avoid anaphylaxis. The polyvalent antitoxin, containing type-C antitoxin, is
indicated in dogs. Mild to moderately affected dogs should recover spontaneously in the absence of
pneumonia. Affected animals do not usually develop immunity to future episodes as the dose of
toxin suffcient to cause clinical signs is not usually sufficient to stimulatc a protective immune
response. Prevention of repeat episodes (although extremely rare) is based upon preventing acccss to
preformed toxin in the diet by limiting access to carrion and not feeding raw or contaminated meat.
Botulism toxin can be ncutralized by heating food to 100°C for 10 minutes or 80"C for 30 minutes.
F. Gila monster venom 12i 15.167.19%6
The Gila monster (Mexican bearded lizard-Heloderma horridum horridum) is a nocrurnal reptile living in
arid regions of southern North Arnerica. Gila monsters may bite following provocation, and the painfil bite
is always associated with the injection of toxin B, which comprises a variety of roxins. Neuromuscular
junction blockade syndrome is reported as onc of the syndromes of Gila envenomation in human medicine,
but it is morc likely to bc the conscquencc of hypotension due to vasoactive effects of a kallikrcin-like
enzymc and not primary neurotoxin cffects on the NMj. Treatment is supportive, with no specific antivenin

Experimental studies on mandaratoxin from the hornet (Vespa mandarinia) have shown that it induces
irreversible blockade of the excitatory postsynaptic potential of the NMJ.
H. Interferon-α14.171
The potential neurotoxic effects of interferon-α are relevant now that its use is increasing in veterinary
medicine. In human medicine, MG secondary to interferon-Q therapy has been reported in nine patients.
It appears that interferon-α results in induced autoantibodies against the ACh receptors in the postsynapric
membrane and may require pyridostigmine therapy.
I.Lithium160.206
In cxpcrimental studies on dogs, lithiuin has been demonstrated to significantly prolong NMj blockade
with both pancuronium bromide and succinylcholine. Although the NMj-blocking effects of lithium are
well documented, the cxact toxic niechanism is unclear.
J.Marine toxins
Marine toxins with demonstrated NMJ-blocking effecrs includc the following:

Considcring the cnvironment these organisms normally inhabit, dog and cat envenomation would be
extremely unusual. For example, human cnvenomation by the fish-hunting marine cone snails (conotoxin) is
almost exclusively restricted to spongc divers. Reported veterinary exposure is confined to sea snakes and
Greenland shark meat.
Ingestion of meat of the Greenland sharlk (Somniosus microcepbalus), particularly fresh meat, has been
demonstrated to be toxic to both humans and dogs. Toxin analysis has demonstrated high levels of trimeth
ylamine oxide, which is reduced in the GIT to trimethylanine (IMA). TMA toxicity occurs acutely
following consumption of Greenland shark meat. In experimental studies, low doses result in increased NMJ
contraction, while high doses appear to cause NM] blockade.

a.Membrane-stabilizing NMJ-blocking agents
The curare class of NMj-blocking agents act on the postsynaptic membrane, binding to the
nicotinic cholinergic receptor and competitively blocking the action of ACh. These agents can be
classifed according to their duration of action into long-, intermediate-, and short-acting. d-
Tubocurarine is an cxample of a long-acting agent (and also one of the most potent), atracurium
and vecuronium are examples of intermediate-acting agents, and mivacurium is an example of a
short-acting agent. The development of newer agents allows a more rapid onset of action, as due
to the fewer side effects of these newer agents (including histamine release, bronchospasm,
hypotension, and excessive secretions) higher doses can be tolerated. Treatment of overdose or
reversal f the effects following general anesthesiais, n general,by administration of anticholn-
or glycopyrrolate) to prevent muscarinic stimulation, antihistamines to counter the antihistamine
effects, and sympathomimetics to maintain blood pressure.
b. Depolarizing NMJ-blocking agents
In contrast to the stabilizing NMj-blocking agents of the curare class, the depolarizing NMJ
agents (including succinylcholine and decamethonium) induce depolarization of the postjunc-
tional membrane by opening ion channels, similarly to ACh, but the resultant depolarization in
the end plate and adjacent area of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is persistent.
C.Ganglionic-blocking agents
Muscle relaxants in clinical use that act as ganglionic-blocking agents may havc clinical signs
similar to the NMJ blocking agents. These substances inhibit synaptic transmission by blocking
postsynaptic ion channels, and they include hexamethonium and trimethaphan camsylate.

1.Organophosphorous compounds (organophosphates)
 Organophosphorous compounds comprise around 20,000 different chemical formulations and
represent one of the most widely studied groups of toxins. Clinical toxicosis with OP compounds in
veterinary medicine is mainly restricted to those substances used as pesticides and usually following
inappropriate or accidental dosing and overdosing. The neurotoxic effects of the OP compounds can
be divided into a number of clinical categories, including the following:
* Cholinergic syndrome (muscarinic, nicotinic, and central nervous system [CNS] effects)
OP-induced delayed polyneuropathy
Neuromuscular transmission syndrome (junctional myopathy)
*Chronic encephalopathy (cognitive dysfunction in affected humans)
Experimentally, the cholinergic dysfunction and the delayed peripheral neuropathy effects have
been extensively studied. The NMJ effects are usually insignificant in relation to the othcr neurotoxic
effects of OP compounds. The underlying pathology rcsulting in the neuromuscular transmission
syndrome has been demonstrated for a number of anti-ACh csterase (AChE) agents, including
several OP compounds, given at doses causing muscle fasciculation. The primary feature is the
presence of a myopathy in selected skeletal muscles, with myofiber necrosis limited to the region of
the NMJ and sparing the cnd plate-free regions of the nuscle. The myopathy is limited to a small
proportion of fibers in certain muscle groups. The necrosis in the region of the end plate suggests
that the myopathy refects altrerations in the end plate induced by AChE inhibition (Fig. 16.10), but
the cxact mechanism is not fully understood.
2.Carbamates
The carbamates are either carbamic or dithiocarbamic acids that are widely uscd as insecticides,
fungicides, and herbicides.Neurotoxic effects of carbamates can be divided into two categories:

of the enzyme active site by OP compounds is similar to acetylation of ACh, but in contrast to ACh, the phosphorylated

Insecticides that have direct neurotoxic effects
Fungicides that mediate their neurotoxic effects through their breakdown products
a.Insecticide carbamates
The insecticidal carbamates are most widely used in veterinary medicine as fea and tick formu-
lations. Toxicity due to insecticidal carbamates usually results in immediate mild to severe signs that
rapidly resolve in most cases. In rare cases, neurologic signs may be delayed or prolonged. The
carbamate insecticides target ACh esterase at parasympathetic autonomic junctions, all ganglia, and
NMJs. Additionally, carbamate insecticides may inhibit crythrocyte AChE, plasma pseudocholines-
terase, and tissue nonspecific carboxylesterase. Short-term exposure of dogs to repeated oral doses of
carbamate insecticides does inhibit plasma,erythrocytic,and CNS cholinesterases,with associated
effects.
If carbaryl is used as an example of a typical carbamate insecticide toxicity, toxic signs would
clinical signs should resolve by 24 hours. Long-term administration is associated with the develop-
ment of tolerance, with dogs receiving oral aldicarb for up to 2 years demonstrating no toxic effects
Carbamate esters appear to induce some neurologic and behavioral changes at dosc levcls with
minimal evidence of toxic effects and in the presence of normal nervous tissue AChE activity.The
mostdramaticevidenceof theeffectofcarbamatetoxicity on theNMJ(in addition toothercholin
ergic effects) was demonstrated in experimental studies in pigs receiving oral carbaryl at 150 mg/kg
body weight for up to 83 days. These pigs developed progressive MG, ataxia, intention tremor, and
clonic muscular contractions leading to paraplegia and recumbency.
Treatment of carbamate insecticidal toxicity is primarily by removing the source and combating
the excessive ACh effects by administering atropine.The dose of atropine should be carefully titrated
to effect by initial, small subcutaneous doses, observing for mydriasis, and evaluating for drying of
the mucous membranes. In addition to atropine, the use of diazepam as a muscle relaxant (to reduce
muscle fasciculations), anxiolytic, and blocker of some of the CNS effects should be considered. The
use of oxime reactivators (e.g., pralidoxime [2-PAM], obidoxime, and pralidoxime mesylate [P2S])
should be avoided in carbamate intoxications (especially for carbaryl). Thesc agents do not appcar to
be effective antidotes, and in the case of carbaryl may actually increase the toxicity. However, this is
not the case for all agents. As with intoxications in animals with aldicarb, 2-PAM and P2S reduced
the toxic effects and improved the beneficial therapeutic effects of atropine.

(1) Fungicide carbamates
Only the dithiocarbamate group of antifungal carbamates has been shown to have
neurotoxic effects. As these agents are usually administered as powders or creams, most
toxicity would be through accidental inhalation or ingestion. In experimental toxicity in the
rat, the induced ataxia and pelvic limb paralysis was demonstrated to be secondary to spinal
cord ventral horn chromatolysis and axonal degeneration, rather than neuromuscular effects.
Whether the demonstrated sensitivity of dogs to ziram results in similar changes as in the rats
or affect the NMJ is unclear, but dogs receiving 25 mg/kg/day demonstrated pelvic limb
weakncss, dcreased refexes, loss of muscle tone, ataxia, tremors, and seizures.
N.Piu
The following plants have the potencial to produce NMJ blockade:
Delphinium spp. (larkspur)
°Aconitum spp. (monkswood and aconite)
·Dihydro-β-erythroidine (alkaloid from seeds of the genus Erythrina)
·Hemlock(Conium maculatum)
·Tubocurarine (Strycbnos toxifera)
A variety of plants has been demonstrated to contain poisonous agents, with the primary effect directed
against the NMJ. Intoxication of dogs and cats would be extremely unlikely. Usually, plant intoxication is
only clinically significant in livestock.
1.Delphinium spp. (larkspur)
Delphinium species intoxication occurs in livestock, and accidental intoxication in cats and dogs
intoxication in rats,mice,and hamsters is characterized by dose-dependent failure of neuromuscular
transmission by diterpenoid alkaloids, although effects on central cholinergic systems and the
autonomic nervous system are probably also part of the clinical picture. Livestock intoxication is
much more common in North America (Delphinium barbeyi, tall larkspur; Delphinium andersonii
low larkspur) than in Europe (Delphinium elatum and Consolida elatum), where the Delphinium
species appear to be less toxic. A number of factors determine toxicity, including plant species,
 growth stage, plant parts, soil composition, and climate.
2. Aconitum spp. (monkswood and aconite)
These plant species contain toxic alkaloids similar to those of the Delphinium species.
3.Dihydro-β-erythroidine (from genus Erythrina)
Dihydro-β-erythroidine is an alkaloid derived from seeds of trees and shrubs of the genus
Erytbrina, which has been demonstrated to be a competitive antagonist at muscle and neuronal
nicotinic receptors. The NMJ effects can be partially reversed with neostigmine.
4.Hemlock (Conium maculaturn)
The neurotoxic agent of Conium maculatum (hemlock, poison hemlock, spotted hemlock,
Nebraska or California fern, or poison fools parsley) is responsible for occasional accidental livestock
and rare human poisoning. The plant is widespread over Europe, Asia, and North and South
America.The toxic agent, conine, results in depression, muscular weakncss, and death du to
respiratory failure in laboratory animals and domestic herbivores. The exact mechanism of NMJ
blockade is poorly understood, but the toxic agent has a curare-like action,
5.Tubocurarine (Strychnos toxifera)
The curare class of NMJ-blocking agents was originally derived from the Strychnos species of
plant, which are widespread throughout the world. The main neurotoxic agent, tubocurarine, acts on
the postsynaptic membrane, binding to the nicotinic cholinergic receptor and competitively blocking
the action of ACh. Following administration, the clinical signs rapidly progress from initial muscle
16 / JUNCTIONOPATHIES: DISORDERS OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION
weakness to faccid paralysis. The first muscles to be affected are the small, rapidly moving muscles
(e.g, extraocular muscles), followed by the limb muscles, the intercostal muscles, ancd finally the
diaphragm. Rccovery occurs in everse order to the loss of motor function. As rubocurarine (and
related compounds) are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, there are no central effects.
O.Snake nvmatin22
The following snake venoms are capable of causing NMJ blockade:
Bungarus fasciatus (krait)-ceruleotoxin
Cobra venom
Coral snake (Micrurus fuloius) and Sonoran coral snake (Micruroides euryxantbus)

Snakebite is a common injury in domestic animals, with an annual estimate of aroud 15,000 incidents
in the United States and 6200 incidents in Australia. While less common, NMJ blockade of domestic
animals as a result of snakebitec envenomation is primarily seen in the Mojave ratlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus
scululatus), the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrifcus), and elapids (including the coral
snakes).
(1) Ihe Mojave and South American rattlesnakes
Toxins of the pit viper group (so-naimed because of the spccialized heat-sensitivc pirs located
between the eyes) are usually associated with hemolytic properries; however, thc primary toxin action
of several species, including the Mojave and South American rattlesnakes, is that of a neurotoxin.
Mojavc toxin is a potent neurotoxin that interferes with neuromuscular transmission by causing a
presynaptic block. The neurotoxin inhibits ACh release and has additional myotoxic effects.
In severely affectcd nerve end plates, only minimal amounts of neurotransmitter release can be
demonstrated, with the nerve impulsc apparently unable to invade the motor axon terminal. Thc
presynaptic inhibition of Mojave toxin follows a time course consistenr with the usual pattcrn for
B neurotoxins, with evidence of a brief initial suppression of contraction lasring a few minutes,
followed by facilitation of ACh release, and finally an exhaustion of neurotransmitter release,
resulting in total NMJ block. The effect of thc toxin on the diaphragm is greater than that on the
skeletal muscle, and this is the usual cause of death.
In comparison to the South American rattlesnake, other clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade
(including cranial ncrve palsies and myoroxicity) are less common in Mojave rattlesnake envenom-
ation, with hypovolcmia and hemotoxicity predominating. Sixty percent to 70% of the volume of
the crude venom from the South American rattlesnake is made up of crotoxin. Croroxin is itself
made up of two components, an acidic crotapotin (crotoxin A) and a basic phospholipase A2-like
(PLA2-like) component (croroxin B). Crotoxin A is not toxic, but when cormbined with crotoxin B
potentiates the toxicity effect. Crotoxin B blocks synaptic transmission by inhibiting the release of
ACh, resulting in the leakage of presynapric ACh from vesicles within the nerve terminal. The
neurotoxin of the South Ainerican rattlesnake therefore results in faccid paralysis by interfering with
depolarization-secretion coupling in the motor axon terminal. Antivenin against presynaptic toxin (in
contrast to postsynaptic toxin) has no rapid effect on neurotoxicity, but instead the effect is to
548
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
remove toxin from the circulation.Administration of antivenin should be reserved only for those
cases in which recent envenomation has been documented. Concurrent hypovolemia and hemotoxic-
ity, if present, should be managed as deemed appropriate.
(2) The elapids (including coral snakes and cobras)
The elapids have been documented to produce at lcast three neurotoxins, including taipoxin, b-
bungarotoxin, and notexin (a subunit of crotoxin and b-bungarotoxin). These toxins cause morpho-
logical changes in the ultrastructure of the motor axon terminal, including an increase in the number
of coated pits in the axolemma, a depletion of synaptic vesicles, and progressive swelling and vacuol-
ization of the mitochondria in the motor axon terminal.For most elapid toxins,the postsynaptic
effect is considered to be of minor importance; one exception to this is cobra venom, for which the
effect is mediated by toxin binding to receptors on the rmotor end plate.
(3) Coral snake envenomation
Coral snakes are nocturnal and clusive in nature. However, due to their aggressive nature, coral
snake envenomation has been documented on a number of occasions in the veterinary literature.
The toxin from coral snakes is primarily neurotoxic, with cnvenomation resulting in blockade of
postsynaptic neuromuscular transmission; however, the exact mechanism of action is not fully
understood. Cholinesterase effects have been demonstrated as a component of the toxin activity but
arcnot thought to contribute significantlyto theNMJ block.The onset ofclinical signs is within 24
hours; this may occur as rapidly as in 30 minutes or may be delayed for up to 15 hours, with the
mean in one prospective study being 170 minutes. The neuromuscular block is characterized by
progressive faccid paralysis with preferential involvement of the craniobulbar muscles and depressed
to absent spinal refexes. Death is due to failure of respiratory muscles, although cardiac arrhythmia
and hemolysis have becn reported in dogs with coral snake envenomation. These latter-mentioned
effects have not been reported in cats.
Confirmation of coral snake envenomation is often difficult due to the delay in onset of clinical
signs, the frequent absence of pain at the site of the bite, and the relatively small puncture marks
from coral snake fangs.Following a thorough search, small punctures can often be found from
which blood can be expressed. If evidence of coral snake envenomation can be demonstrated, the
patient should be transferred rapidly to a facility able to offer ventilatory support in case respiratory
respiratory function usually returning within 48 hours. Aspiration pneumonia is the main complica-
tion, and if it develops, it will result in a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. The prog-
nosis for recovery in cats is usually good with supportive care, and recovery usually occurs in 10-14
days. If the animal is presented early, administration of antivenin (Micrurus fulvius, equine origin)
should be considered,taking care to administer an intradermal test dose to minimize the risk of
anaphylaxis.The antivenin is most effective if administered within 3-4 hours of envenomation.The
venomof theSonoran coral snake(Micruroides euryxanthus)isnotinactivated by theMicrurus
fulvius antivenin,and the treatment in this case is largely supportive.Fortunately, this species of coral
snake is less aggressive (bites are therefore less common) and the symptoms in human patients are
also less severe. The dose of antivenin is based on an estimation of the amount of venom injected
into the patient, but this is difficult in practice, and a minimum of two vials should be administered.
In a study assessing the effcacy of antivenin treatment on snakebite incidents in Australia (alltypes
of venom, not just those acting against the NMJ), the administration of antivenin significantly
improved the chances of survival in both dogs (from a survival rate of 31% to 75%) and cats (from
a survival rate of 66% to 91%).
P.Tetanus toxin (minor effect)78
In addition to the effect that tetanus toxin has on the inhibitory neurons in the CNS, resulting in release of
spinal cord and brain stem motor neurons from inhibition with subsequent hyperexcitability (Fig. 16.11),
the toxin may also have a direct effect on the peripheral somatic neurons. It is thought that the toxin has a

on inhibitory neurons in the central nervous system, tetanus toxin may also have facilitatory effects at the neuromuscular
junction.
direct facilitatory effect at the neuromuscular junction of these neurons. This effect is believed to be medi-
ated by the affnity for binding of hematogenously spread tetanus toxin to the NMJ, and this effect may be
seen prior to the migration of tetanus toxin to the CNS. Canine and feline tetanus are discussed in detail in
Chapter15.
1.Afaccidandafebrile ascendingmotorparalysishasbeendemonstratedin animals andpeople after
exposure to a neurotoxin generated by some strains of certain tick species. Not all infested animals
are affected, with cats in the United States appearing resistant. In Australia, infestation with the
nymphs and larvae, not only the adult tick,may result in clinical signs.The ticks release a salivary
neurotoxin.The toxin acts by interfering with ACh release at the NMJ and/or propagation of the
impulse along motor axon terminals. The toxin may affect both sensory and motor nerve fibers by
altering ionic fuxes that mediate the production of the axon potential. Sixty-four tick species have
been shown to have the potential to produce paralysis, but the species of clinical significance in the
dog and cat population include the following:
Dermacentor variabilis(common wood tick):themost commonly incriminated species in North
America
Dermacentor andersoni (Rocky Mountain wood tick)
Ixodes holocyclus: the most commonly incriminated species in Australia
·Ixodes cornuatus and Ixodes hirsti: occasionally cause paralysis

region.
The exact nature of the toxic agent in tick saliva is unknown, and only gravid females of the
being in tick saliva are the following observations:
°The incubation period is constant, with disease progression mirroring the feeding habits of the
respective tick species.
 Precise manipulation of the incubation period is possible by applying ticks that have been
allowed tofeed on other individuals.
Clinical signs are usually present only when the ticks are fully engorged and rapidly resolve
following rcmoval of the ticks.
Severity of clinical signs is closely correlated to severity of the tick infestation.
Clinical signs of paralysis can be induced by administering tick saliva or tick homogenate to test
animals.
NMJ blockade can be induced in nerve-muscle explants by administration of tick salivary gland
isolates.
* Inoculation of animals susccptible to tick paralysis with material from affected animals fails to
induce paralysis.
2.Affected animals present with an acute, rapidly progressive faccid paralysis with decreased to absent
spinal refexes. A range of 5-9 days of tick attachment is thought to be required for development of
clinical disease. Quadriplegia often develops within 12-72 hours from the onset of clinical signs.
Weakness usually first develops in the pelvic limbs and progresses to involve the thoracic limbs.
Tendon (stretch) reflexes (e.g., patellar reffex) are typically lost before withdrawal reflexes. Cranial
ncrves are occasionally involved. Some dogs may exhibit a voice change (weak bark), suggesting
laryngeal involvement. Facial and masticatory muscles may also be affected. Sensory function is
unaffected. Urethral and anal sphincter function is also typically unaffected. In severe cases, death
may result from respiratory failure or aspiration pneumonia.
3. Diagnosis is based on the history, suggestive clinical presentation, and identification of the offending
tick species (in some cases the engorged female may have dropped off, so a negative finding does not
exclude tick paralysis). As only one tick may cause the clinical signs, in some cases a careful search of
the affected animal is required. Electrophysiological studies in human patients with Dermacentor
induced NMJ blockade have demonstrated the following:
?Motor neuropathy with decrcased motor nerve conduction velocity
 Decreased compound motor-evoked muscle action potcntial amplitude in nerves and their
corresponding muscles
· Impaired afferent nerve impulse propagation
A requirement for higher nerve stimulus current in order to elicit a muscleresponse
Findings of electrophysiological studies in children with I. bolocyclus-induced NMJ blockade
include
*decreased evoked compound motor muscle action potential amplitude, and
normal motor nerve conduction velocity, normal sensory conduction, and a normal response to
repetitive stinulation.
4.Identification and removal of the offending tick usually results in rapid recovery that may start
within hours and continue over several days, although some cases may demonstrate persistent clinical

signs for some weeks. In. tick paralysis, cases lnot due to I. holocyclus, full recovery usually occurs
within 8-12 hours after tick removal. More prolonged recoveries are to be expected with paralysis
due to I holocyclus. Ticlks should be removed with forceps, taking care to rermove the rnouthparts.
Affected dogs and cats should be treated with an acaricide, preferably dipped (thick-coated animals
paralysis, and includes
prevention of pressure sores,
*maintenance of hydration and food intake, and
· prevention of hypostatic and aspiration pneumonia.
An antiserum is available for I. bolocychus that may be of use in severe cases; however, carc must
be taken to avoid anaphylaxis by first administering an intradermal test dose. A high incidcnce of
acute allergy and serum-sickness has been reported in children for whom rhis has bcen used. Animals
that have previously had tick paralysis do not appear to develop a prorective immunity and may be
morc susceptible to future episodes. Prevcntion of tick paralysis in susceptible animals is based on
prevention of tick infestation by the use of acaricidal products, preferably products that offer con-
tinuous protection.

NURSING CARE ANDPHYSICALTHERAPY FORPATIENTSWITH
NEUROLOGIC DISEASE
Mary B.Tefend

I.
Introduction16
Caring for patients with neurologic disease can be extremely challenging, especially if those patients are
nonambulatory or only weakly ambulatory. Management of the rccumbent dog or cat involves primarily
supportive care. A treatment prorocol should be implemented at the onset of paresis or paralysis in order to
motility, fecal retention, urinary bladder damage and urinary tract infctions, decubita ulcers, muscle
atrophy joint stiffness, pain, inadequate nutritional intake, and patient depression or lethargy. As many of
physical therapy,bladdermanagement), clients can become adept at performing basic nursing care for dogs
and cats that are expected to be recumbent for long time periods. Successful nursing care of patients with
neurologic dysfunction is dependent upon cooperation and communication between clinicians, nurses, and
pet owners.
II.
Respiratory Carel.4-6,10,12,1,16
A key factor in treatment of the recumbent patient is prevention of respiratory dysfunction. It is of utmost
importance to assess the respiratory patterns of the patient throughout the course of treatment, to auscultate
frequently, and to consistently monitor oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. Subtle changes in the respira-
tory system can occur within a very short time period in recumbent patients; such changes can subsequently
lead to rapid deterioration of pulmonary function. Although pulse oximetry can be a useful tool in monitor-
ing a patient's oxygenation status, it should never be substituted for a thorough physical examination.
Patients must be turned every 4 hours or kept in a sternal position when at all possible. Managcment should
include sling therapy if the patient is orthopedically stable (see Physical Therapy below). Respiratory com-
plications in the recumbent patient can be life threatening and must be addressed immediately. Stress should
be minimized in the patient in respiratory distress, and oxygen therapy should be administered via the most
effective route. Clinicians should also be aware that severe cervical lesions or lower motor neuron (LMN)
conditions such as polyradiculoneuritis may compromise respiratory function. Blood gas analysis is useful in
monitoring effcacy of ventilation, particularly pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2), as poor
intercostal muscle movement may impair exhalation.
secondary to recumbency include oxygen therapy, nebulization and coupage therapy, positioning techniques
including sling therapy, and mechanical ventilation if respiratory complications are severe. The goals of
treatment for respiratory complications include prevention of respiratory secretions and accumulation,
expansion of atelectic lungs, improved oxygenation, elimination of CO2, and patient comfort.
A. Positioning techniques
Animals that are recumbent for any rcason should be turned every 4 hours from left to right lateral recum
bency to prevent atelectasis or accumulation of lung secretions. If atelectasis or pneumonia is present, the
patient should be propped sternally or positioned with the most normal functioning lung down to improve
559

ventilation. Postural drainage can also be accomplished by positioning the patient in a headl-down posture
(20° from horizontal) for 15-30 minutes every 4 hours to incrcase nucus drainagc and prevent accumula
tion of debris within the trachea (rracheal “plugs"). Ir is important to supervise paticnts closely during
treatment in order to intervene if the patient becomcs stressed or if secrerions obstruct the airway. Postura

airways to larger airways and to clicit coughing to remove such secretions. Acetylcysteine (Mucomyst;
Bcdford Laboratories, Bedford, OHl) may be added to the nebulizer as a mucolytic agent, The recom-
mended dose is 5 ml added to the nebulizer (for a 10% solution) every 12 hours at 4-6 1/min of oxygen. It
severe pneumonia may require ventilator therapy with incrcascd positivc cnd-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
setting to ensure expansion of collapsed alveoli.
1.Materials needed:
Handheld nebulizer (Allegiance Medical Supplies, Dublin, OH)
Oxygen tubing
Anesthictic/oxygen machine
。
5-10 ml sterile salinc
·Face mask
2.Technique
Place the patient in sternal recumbency in a comfortable position. Sling thcrapy can bc imple
mented (see Physical 'Iherapy below) ar the time of nebulization.
Instillsaline into the nebulizer comparrment, do not invert the chamber.
 Connect the oxygcn tubing to the oxygen system and nebulizer. Turn the oxygen to 4-5 1/min to
ensure proper mist flow.
Attach a facc mask to the ncbulizer and apply to the patient.
Nebulize for 5-10 minutes. If the patient does not tolcratc the mask, the nebulizer unit may be
held closely to the nose or mouth.
 Coupage the patient after nebulization by cupping the palms of the hand (or contoured to thc
curvature of the patient's thorax) and strilking the chest rhythmically by altcrnating bctwccn the
right and lefr sides of the chest (Fig. 17.1).
Coupage should be forceful cnough to elicit a cough but not enough to allow the patient to
applied. Coupage should be thythmic and in a circular motion back and forth over the diseased
areas. For puppies, small dogs, and cats, the three midlle fngers should be used for coupage rather

membrane color during coupage, as it may become necessary to coupage in stages to prevent an
and coupage therapy in order to avoid aspiration of food into the airway. A suctioning device should.
be readily accessible if the patient has heavy mucus secretions that may clog the airway and compro-
mise ventilation, particularly in the patient with megaesophagus. Contraindications for ncbulization
and coupage therapy include fail chcst, pneumothorax, severe soft-tissue trauma to thoracic arca,
and thoracoromy with chest tubc placement. Nebulizing via an oxygen cage is not recommended, as
acrolization is not dircct and is usually inadequate. If the patient is oxygen dependent, nasal oxygen
can be utilized during therapy, if not already in usc.
C. Oxygen therapy
Oxygen therapy is critical to the patient exhibiting respiratory dysfunction. Oxygcn should be administercd
in the most effective, least stressful route. It is the opinion of the authors that nasal oxygcn is far superior to
17/NURSINGCAREANDPHYSICALTHERAPYFORPATIENTSWITHNEUROLOGICDISEASE
561
Fig. 17.1. Techniquc for coupage therapy.
 Oxygen cages, although oxygen cages can provide the patient immediate respiratory relief until nasal therapy
can be instituted. Transtracheal or nasal-tracheal oxygen can also be administered if the patient has stenotic
nares or severe facial trauma.
1.Nasal oxygen tube placement
a.Materials needed:
·A soft, polyvinyl catheter (red rubber; Kendall Medical, Mansfield, MA)
·Petroleum jelly for lubrication
·Local ancsthetic
Suture material
 Oxygen tubing
Oxygen canister (Allegiance)
Distilled water
For facilitation of catheter placement,the patient should be restrained in a comfortable
position. The size of the catheter should be large enough to provide adequate oxygen delivery.
The authors recommend use of a size 5 French tube for a cat or small dog, and a size 8-10
French tube for larger dogs. Transparent feeding tubes are not recommended, as the length is
excessive and the tube can be mistaken for an intravcnous line.
b.Technique:
· Instill two to three drops of anesthetic solution into the designated nare (2% lidocainc or
proparacaine).
Lubricate the end of the red rubber catheter, and slide the catheter into the nasal cavity via
the ventral meatus to the medial canthus of the opposite eye.
·The catheter should be brought up over the head eithcr bctween the eyes or along the
mandibular area (preferably in cats) and anchored in place beginning at the nostril by
sutures.
·Oxygen tubing is connected to the catheter by either an adapter (Add-to-Adapter; Allegiance)
or secured with a Chinese finger lock suture.
Oxygen tubing (the proximal cnd) is attached to an infusion bottle flled with distilled water.
Oxygen is then delivered through the water and into the tubing connected to the catheter.If in
562
A PRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
house oxygen is not availablc, a portable oxygen machine can be utilized by connecting the
tubing to the gas inlet valve. An oxygen flow rate of 100 ml/kg/min will provide an oxygen
concentration of approximately 40%. Gastric distension may occur if the conflation rate is too
high. Nasal oxygen catheters should be replaced and changed to the opposite nare every 48 hours
due to mucus accumulation. Elizabethan collars should be placed on the patient to keep the
catheter from being removed.
2. Transtracheal oxygen catheter placement
Transtracheal oxygen may be provided if nasal oxygen is not suitable (e.g., nasal occlusion due to

be used to achieve equivalent oxygen concentrations achieved with nasal catheters; however, place-
Inent is technically more diffcult. Long-term use of transtracheal oxygen should be avoided, as
cathcters. The bandage should be changed every 24 hours and the catheter insertion site monitored
for infammation or irritation.

4.Mechanical ventilation
Mechanical ventilation is a challenging and labor-intensive therapy in any critical care setting.
Indicated for patients who cannot cffectively ventilate on their own, mechanical ventilation improves
gas exchange, decreases the work of breathing, and assts in the recruitment of alveoli. Neurologic
diseases for which mechanical ventilation may be beneficial include secondary pneumonia, severe
neurogenic pulmonary edema,ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), thromboembolic disease,
head trauma, post-cardiopulmonary arrest, and LMN disease. Modes of mechanical ventilation
564
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CANINE AND FELINE NEUROLOGY
therapy include controlled ventilation, assisted ventilation, and intermittent mandatory ventilation
Mechanical ventilators themselves operate as either pressure-limited, volume-limited, or time-limited
systems. Depending on the ventilator employed, respiration is controlled by some combination of
inspiratory pressure, tidal volume, inspiratory tinc, respiratory rare, and minute ventilation. Most
patients require continuous or interimittent sedation. In some cascs, sedative therapy is used in
conjunction with paralytic agents. Complications of positive pressure ventilation include oxygen
toxicity, barotraumas, decreased cardiac output, and pneumonia. Protocols for ventilated patients
should be wcll-cstablished and communication between all tearn members kept active.
Bccause positive prcssurc ventilators achieve lung inflation by applying either continuous or
intermittent positive prcssure to the airway, airtighr seals berween the patient and the ventilator must
be maintained either by a cuffed tracheal or endotracheal rube. Ensuring tight seals should always be
the first priority when ventilating a patient. Oxygen and compressed air lines should be monitored
every hour to ensure proper supply and delivcry. Electrical cords and the power source should be
anchored securely and not in the fow of traffic. The ventilated patient should bc in a sternal posi-
tion, level with the ventiator, and on comforrable bedding or pads to prevent sores or ulccrations. It
is recommended that all ventilated parients have sterile tracheotomy or endotracheal tubes placed on
setup, with the endotracheal tube clearly marked with a visible line at the upper canine toth. to
prevent tube migration. Also recommended at set-up are arterial catheters for serial blood gas
sanpling and direct blood pressure monitoring, central catheters for central venous pressure inoni-
toring and serial electrolyte analysis, and ECG telemetry for detecting cardiac arrhythmias Closed
r  s g np   oe  s rn
frequently, and circulating water heating pads should be available for hypothermia.
Wherein the goals of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) are to restore oxygcnation and correct
 sse  re ss sd t q a p qr 
addition, patients with diseased or noncompliant lhung parenchyma are often placed on higher than
normal pressure setings in order to prevent simall airway and alveolar collapse. Clinical signs of
barotrauma can include rapid, shalow voluntary respirations, absence of lung sounds, abnormally
high trends in the central venous pressure, and abnormal sPO, and ETCO, readings.
Pulse oximetry should be used on every ventilated patien. If pulse oximeter readings are less
tracheal tube has not migrated or is occluded by a kink or mucous plug. Ensure tight connections of
all airway tubing. Secondly, visibly inspcct the patient's mucous membrane color, pulse quality, and
heart rate; auscultate lung fields for a possible pneuinothorax. Ensure that the probc has not
migrated, or change location of the probe. Until the problem can be identified, incrcasc the oxygen
How (FiO2) to 100%. Verify low oxygen content by running an arterial blood gas, and notify the
Capnography should be used on the ventilated patienr. The FTCO, values generally should be
kept bctwcen 3045 mm Hg; high CO2 values should initially prompt a search for tube occlusion,
migrarion, or pneumothorax. Verify high settings with an arterial blood gas analysis; ventilator
settings (breaths per minute) or cndotracheal tube length may be altered to dccrcasc dead space. Low
ETCO, values should be monitored for rube occlusion, leaking airway tubing, or a non-patent cuff.
Verification is also recommended by analyzing an arterial blood gas, as ventilator settings may need
to be altered. The ventilated patient should be monitored for leaking airway sounds, such as bub-
bling or fuid sounds on inspiration, around the cuff or oral area.
Other considerations with patients on PPV include possible blood pressure abnormalities due to
impaired intrathoracic blood fow. As PPV increases pleural pressure, venous return can becone
compromised to both sides of the heart, affecting diastolic filling. Mechanisms to control such
impedance include manipulation of inspiratory timc (the lengzh of time pressure is applied) and
manipulating respiratory rate (increasing the ratc could prevent cardiovascular recovery time).
17/NURSINGCAREANDPHYSICALTHERAPYFORPATIENTSWITHNEUROLOGICDISEASE
565
Changes in central venous pressure trends, diastolic and systolic blood pressure trends, pulse quality,
mucous membrane color, and heart rate may denote compromise of cardiac performance in the
ventilated patient. Any abnormal trends following set up on the ventilator warrant changes in
mechanical settings.
Note that it is always recommended to use minimal ventilator settings to prevent barotraumas
and altered blood fow. Consequently, monitoring the arterial blood gases on set up and within the
first few hours of PPV are critical. Minimal acceptable PaO2 values should be about 90 mm Hg,
with maximum PaCOz values of 60 mm Hg, although cvery patient should be evaluated on an
individual basis.
As most patients will not voluntarily be mechanically ventilated, “bucking” the ventilator
(patienr-ventilator asynchrony) can become problematic. Changing ventilator mode to intermittent
mandatory ventilation (IMV) can improve patient-ventilator synchrony and sedation protocols can
be modified to control patient-ventilator
or asynchrony. Opioids should be used with caution, as
abnormal breathing patterns (panting) may surface as a result of their use. Injectable anesthetic
agents, such as propofol, should be kept readily available in the event of tube migration or tube
lumen occlusion, requiring re-intubation.
Preventing tube occlusion is critical. If an endotracheal tube is used, sterile suctioning after
sterile saline administration is recommended every 4 hours.Note that there are complications of
trachcal suctioning, such as hypoxemia, traumatic airway ulceration, cardiac dysrhythmias secondary
to hypoxia and pain, and infection from improper technique. High FiO2 levels (100%) are recom-
mended both immediately before and after suctioning, with strict sterile technique applied. Suction-
ing should be brief and thorough, with the suction catheter fed to the bifurcation only.
If a tracheotomy tube is used on the ventilated patient, ensure that the tracheotomy tube used
has both a cuff and an inner and outer cannula, if at all possible. The inner cannula can be removed
for more thorough cleansing, and can be suctioned with the aforementioned technique. If a trache-
aseptic technique. Endotracheal tubes should be removed and replaced with a sterile tube every 24
hours.In addition,nebulizing through the tracheal tube is recommended to maintain hydration of
pulmonary parenchyma, particularly if pneumonia is present.
Patient hydration should be asscssed by monitoring urinary output, daily weighing, electrolyte
analysis, and central venous pressure monitoring. As multiple organ dysfunction can occur in any
critical patient, renal values should be monitored with consistency. Nutrition should also be
addressed either by nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, depending on the length of proposed ventila-
tion.Note that if nutrition is delivered to the ventilated patient, gastrointestinal (GI) motility may
be impaired; consequently, aspirating stomach tubes is warranted to monitor residual volume.
Facilitating colonic emptying may be required by either an enema or rectal palpation,
It is recommended that patients on PPV be kept in sternal recumbency. Passive range of motion,
Hexion/extension, and massage/effeurage should be performed every 46 hours. In addition, gentle
coupage is recommended to prevent lung parenchyma atelectasis and to help mobilize secretions to
central areas reached by routine suctioning. Oral care should also be addressed in order to prevent
nosocomial pneumonia. The oral cavity should be fushed with dilute chlorhexidine and suctioned
every 12 hours. The tongue can be kept moist by wrapping it with moist gauze and kept inside the
oral cavity. Pressure sores on the tongue can be reduced by the use of mouth bridges or gags. The
eyes should also be kept moist by saline fushes and eye lube cvery 4--6 hours.
Allpatients on mechanical ventilation are at a high risk of infection. Minimizing risk by being
conscientious, practicing sterility with handling of catheters and tubes, and cleaning circuitry
hetween patients are highly recommended. Established protocols for patient setup, maintenance, and
recovery are paramount for a successful outcome. Communication between the nursing staff and
clinicians should be concise, and team members need to be ready for any emergency situation, such
as re-intubation, hand ventilation (from power failure or machine malfunction), or tube occlusion.

5.Placement of arterial catheters
Arterial catheters are placed in order to check serial blood gas during respiratory difficulty,
hypercapnia, hypoxia, and mechanical ventilation. Catheters are also used for direct blood pressure
monitoring.
Arterial catheters should not be used in thrombolytic disease or coagulopathic diseasc patients.

b.Technique:
·Lay the patient in latcral recumbency.
Clip and prep dorsal pedal area (down leg).
Palpate the pulse with a single digit.
Use a stab incision for a “cut down” at a 45° angle and at least 1 inch away from a palpable
pulse.
Hold the catheter like a dart; insert the catheter with the bevel up through a tunneled area.
Use “baby-steps" toward the pulse (superficial); back out and redirect if there is no fash.
 Once a fash is obtained, be careful not to move the catheter; slide the entire length of wire
via the black tab handle.
“Pop” the catheter off the wire and into the arterial space.

Cover the catheter with clasticon and label “ART."
Change the catheter cap, bandage, and sterile gauze daily. Flush the catheter every 2 hours
with heparinized saline, if you are not using it as a continuous rate infusion (CRI).
Important note: Do not give any medications through the arterial catheter.
 I1.  Recumbency and Pressure Sores2,4.,16.19
Other complications of the recumbent animal include devclopment of pressure sores or decubital ulcers.
These are local areas of skin necrosis. Pressure sores are often localized to bony prominences; localized
pressure over these areas leads to tissue ischemia of variable severity. The extent of tissuc damage is often
graded from least severe (grade I: darkened area of thickened skin, no exposure of subcutaneous tissue) to
most severe (grade IV: deep tissue loss with exposure of bone). Grade II decubital ulcers involve exposure of
subcutaneous fat, and grade III ulcers involve tissue defects to the level of deep fascial layers.
Frequent turning of the patient and appropriate bedding represent the most important preventative
measures of a nursing-care protocol. Increased skin moisture and irritation contribute to the development of
decubital ulcers; therefore, patients should be kept clean and dry and should be bathed frequently. Since
decubital ulcers are primarily caused by pressure, they can be avoided or minimized by using bedding such
as sheepskin, foam or air mattresscs, trampolines, or bandaging rechniques. Sheepskin is advantageous in

that it is inexpensive and can be laundered for multiple uses. The sheepskin minimizes friction and can
absorb moisture, particularly important in preventing urine scalding. Sheepskin may make patients hot, so
rectal temperatures should be monitored frequcntly when this bedding material is used. Air mattresses are
also inexpensive and allow pressure distribution to avoid decubital ulceration. Disadvantages associated with
airmattresses include puncture holes from the patient's nails and the inability to launder air mattresses for
long-term use. Urine scalding can also occur with the use of air mattresses. Trampolines are an excellent
choice for the recumbent patient (e.g, Slee-Pee Time Beds, Inc., Charlottesville, VA). The trampolines are
also distributes a patient's weight evenly, helping to prevent pressure sores. Urine scalding is also avoided by
the fiberglass netting, as the urine falls underneath the patient onto plastic trays.Bandaging techniques in
the form of doughnuts (Fig. 17.3) can also be placed over bony prominences to prevent decubital ulcers or
over existing decubital ulccrs to prevent further pressure damage. Such devices can effectively relieve pressure
while allowing for adequate aeration of tissues. Treatment of decubital ulcers may involve medical and/or
surgical therapies. Specific medical therapy depends upon the individual case,but may involve frequent
wound lavage, systemic antibiotics, wet-to-dry bandaging, and application of topical drugs. These topical
ointments) and enzymatic debriding agents. Additionally, Preparation-H is believed to stimulate wound
healing when applied to decubital ulcers. Surgical intervention may be required for decubital ulcers, espe-
cially if they are grade II or IV in scverity. Such intervention may include debridement and primary
closure, delayed wound closure, or use of cutaneous or myocutaneous faps.
Urinary complications are common in dogs and cats with neurologic dysfunction. Overdistension of the
urinary bladder and urinary tract infections are typical sequelac, both of which are avoidable with attentive
nursing care. Proper technique in both expressing and catheterizing the bladder is important to prevent
urethral and bladder wall trauma, to prevent introduction of bacteria into the urinary tract, and to measurc
urinary output in the oliguric or anuric patient as a guideline for appropriate fuid therapy. Poor nutrition
and decreased water intake can also affect the patient's urinary system and should be corrected. Overdisten-
sion of the bladder can result in permanent atony of the detrusor muscle. The bladder should be palpated to
estimate size, even if there is urine present in the cage. The presence of urine in the patient's cage is not a

reliable indicator of the ability to urinate voluntarily; the patient could have urinary overfow as a result of
distension.The bladder should be expressed every 4-6 hours as a general rule, but the urodynamics of each
patient should be assessed on an individual basis (e.g., prednisone use or IV fuids could warrant bladder
cvacuation more frequently). If the bladder cannot be expressed without minimal stress to the patient, a
urinary catheter should be placed. Whether placing a closed urinary collection system or intermittently
catheterizing the urinary bladder, proper sterile technique must be followed in order to avoid nosocomial
urinary tract infections.
A. General guidelines for urinary bladder cxpression
to best determine which pharmacologic agents will be most efficacious in improving bladder function (see
Chapter 13). Before expressing the bladder, it is advisable to first allow the patient to try to urinate volun-
tarily by walking or carting the animal outside.If the patient does voluntarily urinate, it is still necessary to
palpate the bladder after urination to ensure complete evacuation. Catheterization may be necessary in order
to determine the amount of residual urine left after urinating if the bladder still palpates as large. Normal
residual urinc volume in the dog bladder is between 0.2 and 0.4 ml/kg body weight; this is believed to be
similar for cats. Note that the foremost objectivc in bladder expression is to avoid overdistension and
detrusor muscle atony. Stress should be minimized during bladder expression by using proper technique.
1.Technique (see Fig. 17.4):
· Place the patient in a comfortable position, either standing or in latcral recumbency.
·If the patient is in lateral recumbency, gently place one hand on the upper abdominal wall and
hand on each side of the abdomen. In either case, the hands should be initially placed just caudal
to the last rib
Gently palpate the abdomen, slowly advancing the hands medially toward each other. If the
urinary bladder is not palpable, simultaneously move both hands caudally until the bladder is
contacted.Since the bladder is somewhat mobile within the abdomen,and bladder size is
variable, starting cranially and manipulating the bladder caudally will force the bladder into the
pelvic inlet region, preventing it from escaping the clinician's grasp.
569

C
Fig.17.4.Continued
 Once the bladder wall is palpable, steady, even pressure is applied with both hands. The direction
of the pressure should be medial and caudal. Gently express the bladder until it feels empty. The
clinician should be able to feel the bladder “defate” as urine is expressed.
It is important to note that with frcquent bladder expressions, the abdomen may become
tense as a result of patient anxicty, consequently making the bladder diffcult to express. In
addition,as the abdomen tenses,the bladder may become displaced in an otherwise abnormal
position (cranially). Evacuation of the bladder should never be forceful or aggressive. Catheteriza-
tion may become necessary until pharmacologic agents are of benefit.

B. General guidelines for urinary bladder catheterization
Urinary catheterization can introduce microbes into both the bladder and the kidneys, traumatize the
urethra, and cause patient discomfort. Catheterization of the neurologic patient should be performed only if
attempts at bladder expression are unsuccessful or contraindicated (ie., entrapped bladder, suspected bladder
trauma from automobile trauma), or for recumbent, critical patients with spinal injuries.The type and
length of the urinary catheter is important to facilitate efficient bladder evacuation and to measure urinary
device for anchorage should be used, particularly in the female dog.If less-frequent catheterization is
warranted,bladder decompression can be obtained by intermittent catheterization twoto three times daily
using a soft, polyvinyl or red rubber catheter or feeding tube (Kendall Medical, Sherwood Medical). It is of
utmost importance to ensure adequate length of the urinary catheter. The catheter should always reach into
the neck of the bladder for either system. The catheter should have a visible marker in order to determine if
it is backing out during patient use. If a Foley catheter is used, adequate dilation of the balloon should be
maintained with at least half the amount of air or fuid suggested by the manufacturer (the amount should
be indicated on the sleeve of the balloon).
1.Materials needed:
Appropriate length and gauge of urinary catheter and stylet (Foley; Cook Veterinary Products,
Bloomington,IN,for indwelling catheters; or soft,red rubber catheters or feeding tubes,Kendall
Medical)
Sterilegloves
Sterile lube (Surgilube;Altana Inc,Melville,NY)
·Mild cleansing agent (e.g., dilute chlorhexidine)
Suture material and medical tape (for indwelling catheters)
Sterile closed collection system (for indwelling catheters)
Clippers for sterile preparation (female)
Sterile syringes for urine sample containment
Sterile fuid-filled syringes (saline preferred)
2.Technique
When positioning the patient for placement of a urinary catheter, it should be kept in mind
that, while restraint is necessary, the comfort of the patient is of the utmost importance. The patient
should be placed in a position that will facilitate both sterile technique and successful catheterization.
In the male dog, lateral recumbency is preferred, with the prepuce retracted and the penis aligned
parallel with the long axis of the body (Fig. 17.5). A stylet in the catheter for the male patient is

17/NURSINGCAREANDPHYSICALTHERAPYFORPATIENTSWITHNEUROLOGICDISEASE-571
usually not required, unless urethral stones are present or suspected. When catheterizing male cats,
the penis must be straightened before passing the catheter. This is accomplished by applying caudal
traction to the preputial region, directing the penis in a caudal direction, parallel with the long axis
of the body. Female patients can be placed either in sternal (usually preferable) or lateral recumbency
(whichcvcr is most comfortable for the patient yet optimal for the visualization of the urethral
papilla). Due to the curvature and size of the papilla, a stylet in the urinary catheter is often useful
when catheterizing the female patient.Mild sedation should be considered for the comfort of the
patient and to facilitate cathcterization via relaxation of the urethral musculature. Urethral cathetcr-
ization may be facilitated in some cases by using a syringe attachment and pulsating fuid as the
catheter is being advanced.
Position the patient for catheter placement (lateral for males, sternal for females).
Prepare the catheter insertion site with antiseptic solution. Shave the perivulvar area in females
prior to skin preparation.
Wearing sterile gloves, inspect the balloon on the Foley catheter, lubricate the catheter, and
mcasure the cstimated length of catheter to be passed by marking the distal end of the catheter
with a permanent marker.
·Pass the catheter while an assistant retracts the prepuce or vaginal folds.
For female patients, visualization of papillae may be best accomplished with a laryngoscope light
and a vaginal speculum (Fig. 17.6)
Pass the catheter to the desired measured length.
For closed indwelling systems:
·Infate the balloon of the Foley catheter with the recommended amount of saline (written on the
side of the balloon arm).
Pull the Foley catheter out of the urethrauntil theballoon catches on thebladder neck(females
only).
Wipe the catheter dry, and fasten it with tape and suture it in place (Fig. 17.7).
Obtain aurine sample and attach closed system.

It is recommended to place stay sutures both around the catheter and prepuce/vulva region, with the
remainder of the urinary catheter fastened around either the tail or abdominal area to prevent dislodgement.
The outer portion of the urinary catheter should be labeled with permanent marker in order to monitor
optimal insertion length for the duration of use.Thc patient should be observed closcly for licking.
chewing, or.biting at the urinary collection system. An Elizabethan collar should be placed if a patient
displays such bchavior, to prevent premature catheter removal. Excessive force is contraindicated in the
passage of any urinary catheter. Urethral trauma, including tears, can result from aggressive catheterization
acceptable indwelling catheters include those made of polyvinyl chloride (Kendall Division) or silicone Foley
catheters (Cook Veterinary Medical). Polypropylene catheters should not be used for indwelling catheters, as
they are stiff and uncomfortable to the patient and may cause uroepithelial damage. The length of the
catheter is also important. Inserting excessive catheter length may result in the catheter looping around itself
Placing the catheter in the urethra and not into the bladder can also hinder bladder evacuation or drainagc.
The tip of the catheter should ideally be inserted to reach the caudal aspect of the bladder lumen, in the
trigone arca. Radiographs may be indicated to ensure proper placement if urine production is
questionable.
C. Indwelling versus intermittent urinary bladder catheterization and catheter care
Indwelling catheters are advantageous for patients who run the risk of repeat urethral blockage (e.g., feline
urolithiasis).Repeated catheterization of such patients may lead to further urethral trauma and tissuc
infammation,patient discomfort, and introduction ofmicrobes.Indwelling cathcters are also beneficial for
patients receiving large volumes of crystalloid fuids as a tool to properly gauge renal function (e.g., “ins and
outs” fuid therapy). Indwelling systems are also useful for recumbent patients who cannot be moved
outdoors to urinate (e.g, spinal fracture patients) and patients with atonic bladders or historical/clinical
evidence of bladder trauma.The importance of aseptic technique cannot be overemphasized;antibiotic
therapy to avoid a urinary tract infection is not recommended, as this practice may facilitate antibiotic-
resistant urinary tract infections. It is important to maintain a sterile collection system if an indwelling
urinary catheter is used. Caution should be exercised when moving either the urine collection bag or the
patient to avoid urinary fow from the bag back into the patient. If an intravenous drip set is used for the
collection device, the roll clamp should be removed to avoid the mistake of restricting urine fow. The urine
experiencing hematuria or urolithiasis, intermittently fushing the bladder with sterile saline is recom
mended. The urine collection bag should be cmptied every 4 hours and urine production carefully recorded.
573
If urine production appcars inadequate, accuratc placement and patency of the urinary catheter should be
verified before increasing fluid administration.
In summary, to minimize urinary rract infections from an indwelling catheter, sterile technique should
be observed. However, the best way to avoid urinary tract infection is to remove the catheter as soon as it is
feasible lo do so. Approximately one-half of dogs catheterized for 4 days or longer will develop a urinary
tract infection. If a closed urinary system is used, tlie prepuce or vaginal area around the urinary catheter
should be swabbed every 12 hours with dilute chlorhexidine to minimize bacterial growth. Urinary collec-
tion bags should be changed every other day.
Current recommendations for urine culture and susceptibility testing does niot include culturing the
urinary cathercr tip. 'The urinary catheter shouild be removed and a urine sample coilected via cystocentesis

tion rmay be used to obrain a urine sanple if a diagnosis is dependent on urinalysis and cystocentesis is
contraindicated or unsuccessful. Intermitrent cathcterization may also be used for patients experiencing
contracility difficulty; manual expression may be difficult in such patients and may cause discomfort. It
should be kepr in mind that frequent intermittent catheterization may lead to patient discomfort, urethral
trauma, and urinary tract infection. The practice of intermitrent cathcterization should only be used for thc
housed with dry bedding in order to prevent urinc scalding if the patient is recumbent and docs not have a
closed urinary system. As discussed previously, trampolines are available to prevent the patient from lying in
urine if 24-hour care is not provided (Slee-Pee Time Beds, Inc.).
Physical Therapy24,-9,1,1,2021
The major goals of physical therapy are to attain or inaintain full range of joint rnotion, rninirnize rmuscle
atrophy, and prevent or ameliorate patient discomfort. Traditional thcrapics of hot packing, cold packing,
massage, and simple strctching exercises in veterinary medicine have bcen supplcmcnted by morc advanced
treatments, such as hydrothcrapy sling therapy, ultrasound, eletrical stimulation, sling-supported exercise,
and acupuncture. There is an incrcasing dcmand for prolonged postoperative care in dogs and cats, reflective
of advancemennts in veterinary neurosurgery. Emphasis on such physical therapeutics can result in shorter
hospitalization periods and improved patient well-being. A plan for physical therapy should be discussed
between veterinarian, technician, and owner, in order to provide the best rehabilitation progran. Benefits of
physical therapy include improved circulation, increased production of collagen, decreased inflammation,
decreased muscle atrophy, and prevention of joint stiffness
It is extremely inportant to have protocols of physical therapy discussed between veterinarian and
technician, as patients with identical diagnoses may require differcnt frcatments. For exanple, animals with
intervertebral disk disease may have varying degrees of neurologic impairment and will requirc differing
stabilization techniques and will consequently reccive a physical therapy regime dependent upon the surgical
technique. Soft tissue trauma, such as is offcn cncounterecd ir automobile accidents, may be complicated by
delayed wound healing if physical thcrapy is instituted prematurely.
Therapeutic cold packing. or cryotherapy, is an imporrant nursing technique for the acutely injured
paticnt, Cold packing is efficacious in producing local vasoconstriction and in preventing interstitial bleed-
ing and should be the first form of therapy insrituted. Owners can be instructcd to apply a cold pack to the
injured animal cn route to the hospital. Benefits of cold therapy include reduction of enzymatic tissue
activity (thereby reducing tissue destruction) and a reduction of pain perception. Typically, cold packing is

ice into plastic bags; alternatively, gcl packs can be purchased at packing stores and kept refrigerated. It is
usually best nor to freeze the cold packs or plastic conrainers as the packs become diffcult to mold around
the injured area. Subzero blankets, which circulate cold water, can also be purchased at hospital pharmacies

and can be useful in cold-packing procedures. In addition, subzero blankets can be utilized for head trauma
patients by decreasing total body temperature in order to decrease intracranial pressure (see Chapter 6). Hot
packing should follow cold therapy after 72 hours.Therapeutic hot packing in the form of moist,heated
towels is a comrmon form of physical therapy used to relieve pain, decrease tissue edema resulting from
inflammation, relax muscle spasms, and increase circulation. Hot packing prior to stretching exercises can
also promote fexibility and increase range of motion. Moist heat is recormrmended for hot-packing therapy
such as warm moistened towels or hot water bottles. Heat therapy should be implemented after 72 hours
and applied every6-8hours for 20minutes around the affected area.It isnotrecommended by the authors
to use heating pads for heat therapy, particularly for animals recovering from anesthesia or patients with
sensory nerve impairment. Use of such devices may lead to thermal burns.
Massage is another form of physical therapy used in veterinary medicine. Manipulation of the tissue by
simplehand technique canincrease circulation,loosen stiffmuscles,reduceexcess interstitialuid,and
minimize muscle atrophy. Massage can also be beneficial prior to stretching exercises to improve range of
motion, relax the patient before more aggressive therapy can be instituted, and provide increased circulation.

depending on the goal of massage therapy. Appropriate pressure should be light to moderate in order to
relieve tension and to decrease edema. If fbrotic areas are present, pressure of massage should be increased.
It is important to monitor response in the patient and to avoid excessive pain. Massage therapy should be
implemcnted three to four times daily, for 10-15 minutes to each affected area, in conjunction with other
forms of therapy mentioned bclow. Technique of massage or effeurage may vary. The authors prefer to start
with the distal aspect of each affected limb and apply light to moderate pressure in smooth movcments with
the fingertips running lateral and medial before returning distally and removing pressure. Using the palm of
the hand, kneading or twisting the skin may also improve circulation and create an effective massage to
larger muscular groups. Massage technique should not be applied to areas with soft-tissue damage or skin
grafts.
Stretching or passive range of inotion exercises are an important form of physical therapy that can be
performed by both technician and owner. Benefits of passive range of rmotion include joint homeostasis,
muscle atrophy, and prevention of tissuc adhesions. Similar to other forms of physical therapy, it is impor-
therapy on an individual basis. Ideally, passive range of motion exercises should begin the day after surgery
or injury, unless there is severe soft tissue damage or orthopedic injury. Passive range of motion is accom-
plished through a series of repetitious motions. It is the authors opinion that each limb should be cycled
individually in order for adequate assessment of function and range of motion of all limbs. By holding the
foot with one hand and grasping the caudal aspect of the stifle or elbow with the other, the limb is pulled
forward and then back in a cycling motion (Fig. 17.8). It is recommended to perform 5-10 flexions and
scheduled at least three times a day. Particular attention should be given to the limb that is injured or
surgically repaired and caution used with regard to the patient's pain response. Geriatric patients require
careful fexion, as fragility of bone density may be an issue. Patients with sensory nerve impairment must
also be fexed with caution, as pain response may be absent. The goal of passive range of motion is to cycle
the limbs through a normal range of motion with normal joint motility. Hot packing and massage may be
initiated prior to range of motion exerciscs to facilitate muscle and joint compliance. Combining sling
therapy with passive range of motion exercises can also provide added physical benefit to the patient.
Providing a more natural sternal position without added limb stress permits gravity to pull the limbs for

increased circulation and stimulation. The gravity supplied by the sling will also promote drainage and
decrease edema that often develops with recumbent patients.
An exercise ball (Physio-Roll; Sportime International, Atlanta, GA) may also be used to assist standing
or to increase weight bearing on the thoracic and/or pelvic limbs (Fig. 17.9). The exercise ball also provides
grcater lateral support and can relieve stress on the handlers. The size of the ball should alow the patient to
touch the ground with all four feet; if the roll is too tall, it may be deflated slightly. Once the patient is
secure on the ball, one person should stabilize the front of the patient while another stabilizes the rear.As
the patient is supported in a standing position, the technician can generate a very gentle up-and-down
“"bouncing” motion through the patient and the inflated ball. Such activity will provide proprioceptive input
and stimulate contraction of the limb muscles.In addition, rolling the ball forward and backward will

provide weight-bearing exercises to the thoracic or pelvic limbs. As the patient's strength progresses, these
techniques may be performed at faster speeds to challenge balance and neuromuscular function. Exercise
ball techniques may require more patient conditioning and technician training than other traditional
rehabilitationtechniques.
Sling therapy is an important aspect of physical therapy, particularly in the recumbent patient. Slings
can be constructed out of plastic piping (Fig. 17.10) or aluminum welded pipes (Fig. 17.11) for long-term
use. Sliding pipes can hold canvas or cloth harnesses with holes for each limb. Either design can provide the
patient with adequate support to maintain sternal positioning for therapy exercises or chest physiotherapy.
Limb edema is decreased with the use of sling therapy, and it provides optimum positioning for massage,
range of motion exercises, and nebulization/coupage therapy. Bladder care can be easily addressed while in

the sling using manual techniques; the patient can also be encouraged to urinate voluntarily while in an
upright position. In addition, placing a patient in a sling provides sternal positioning for feeding, which is
important in the recumbent patient to prevent aspiration pneumonia. Patients placed in slings should have
the pads of the feet touching the foor mats to encourage voluntary motion. Slings with wheels attached can
allow patients to walk about the hospital with little aid or support. Owners can be encouraged to build a
sling apparatus device for long-term paresis/paralysis patients. Sling therapy is particularly useful in prevent-
ing lung atelectasis and accumulation of respiratory secretions in dependant airways. Lung consolidation can
occur with any patient that is recumbent (see respiratory therapy above). The sling provides the patient a
means to stay sternally recumbent; this enhances drainage of respiratory secretions, lung expansion, and
overall ventilatory efficiency. Caution should be exercised when placing the patient into the sling as the
patient may have stiff joints or various orthopedic conditions.Recumbent patients should be placed in a
sling every 4-6 hours, with physical therapy sessions in conjunction with sling therapy, chest physiotherapy,
hot or cold packing, bladder care, and feeding. Patients should remain in the sling for 30 minutes to an
hour and be monitored closely for discomfort or anxiety. The patient may require additional cervical or
thoracic support in the form of pillows or rolled towels while in the sling. Initially, it may be necessary to
place a patient in the sling device for shorter periods until the patient has adjusted to being constrained in
an upright fashion. During sling therapy, the patient should be monitored closely, particularly if the patient
has pneumonia (see respiratory care above). Respiratory paterns should be monitored to ensure that the
animal is not stressed during therapy.
Hydrotherapy is another form of physical therapy advantageous to the neurologically impaired or
recumbent patient. Hydrotherapy, or swimming exercise, provides extensive joint and muscle activity in a
non-weight-bearing setting. Hydrotherapy can be achieved using a tub or pool equipped with an electric

during hydrotherapy to prevent drowning or severe injury. Flotation devices designed specifically for canine
use are recommended during hydrotherapy. Physical support to the cervical and thoracic areas is recom-
mended during hydrotherapy, even with fotation device use. If the patient becomes overly distraught or
frantic during hydrotherapy, treatment should be discontinued and attempted again the next day. Hydro-
therapy should be limited to 5 minutes per day, as swimming exercises are exhausting. Specialized veterinary
life-vests(FidoFloat;Premier,Midlothian,VA)can be utilized as a sling device tohelpprovide thoracic
support during hydrotherapy (Fig. 17.13).Many such specialty vests contain handles on the top of the
jacket for quick and easy grabbing. Slow, methodical bobbing” of the patient while wearing a vest in a
whirlpool can strengthen periarticular muscles, increase limb perfusion, and improve joint mobility. Exercise
for the recumbent or neurologically compromised patient can be accomplished by use of body slings or
towels. Towel walking a patient can be a safe way to begin exercises and to encourage muscle movement
(Fig. 17.14). It is important to support the paretic area with a towel and to prevent the limbs from dragging
on the ground.Tail walking, or using the tail as a means to hold a patient in upright fashion,is generally
not recommended. Towel walking should not be practiced in patients with unstable vertebral fracture/

luxations or patients with orthopedic problems that may be exacerbated by towel walking (e.g. pelvic
fractures). Paraparetic patients can also be exercised by means of body slings (from Walkabout Harnesses,
rather, the harness should elevate the patient so that the limbs are supported slightly by the ground surface.
This will encourage voluntary movement and prevent abrasion of the toes.Pet owners should be encouraged
to purchase the body slings and assist their pets in early postsurgical ambulation. Commercially available
custom canine carts are also available in four-wheel and two-wheel models for patients with paralysis,
paresis, or generalized weakness. The carts are designed to assist the patient with independent ambulation;
the carts must be sized and fitted to ensure comfort and proper function.Most manufacturers will provide
the client with specific instructions regarding proper measurements to ensure a custom fit. The mobility
carts foster independence that will produce a positive effect on both the animal and client's attitude. The
home environment may need to be altered to allow the animal to ambulate freely without obstruction or
accidental injury (Fig. 17.16).
VI.Seizure Management
Seizures are classified as focal (partial) or generalized. Clinical manifestations of a focal seizure can include
rapidly running in circles, hypersalivating, exaggerated chewing motions, or an acute change in conscious-
nessorbehavior.Generalizedseizures involvethewholebodywith an alteration or loss of consciousness.
The subject of seizures is covered in more detail in Chapter 7. The patient may fall to the ground and
rigidly extend its legs, followed by running or paddling motions, chewing motions, and may also involun-
tarily urinate or defecate. Seizures may alternate between focal and generalized, with duration ranging from
seconds to minutes.
It is important for the technician to take action during either type of seizure.The patient must be
immediately placed sternal, with the head angled down to prevent aspiration. The head and neck should be
cradled or supported to prevent traumatic injury. Intravenous access should be established for administration

of anticonvulsants, if a catheter is not already in place. Oxygen should be administered immediately after
a seizure. Support the body in sternal position and keep environmental noise to a minimum. Note that the
patient may also have dilated pupils, salivate excessively, vocalize, or vomit immediately after the seizure.
Rectal temperature should be taken immediately after a seizure.In addition, serum blood glucose should be
tested to rule out hypoglycemia as a cause for the seizure. Suction should be performed if the post-ictal
patient has excessive salivation or vomitus in the oral cavity in order to prevent aspiration or airway
occlusion.
Patients may seizure after myelography. It is important to elevate the head with towels or pillows while
the patient is recovering after a myelogram in order to limit seizure activity (Fig. 17.17). The post-myelo-
gram patient should remain on intravenous fuids 24 hours afer the procedure.
VII. Level of Consciousness18
Recording vital signs should always begin with level of consciousness (LOC). It is important to note that
problems associated with the central nervous system (CNS) may be the first clue of forthcoming complica-
tions. Central nervous system signs may reflect a systemic disorder or a disorder secondary to either anesthe
hyperexcitability. History of prolonged anesthesia may also result in hypoxia, embolism, increased intracra-
nial pressure or hemorrhage, thrombosis, hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia, and drug reactions. If any abnor-
malities in the LOC exist, an extensive physical examination, including appropriate hematologic testing.
should be emphasized. Pupil size and pupil reactivity should be included in the physical examination.
Technicians should also monitor patient mentation using the Modified Glasgow Coma Scale system (see
Chapter 6). Prognosis is correlated to depth of coma; typically, the lower the score on the GCS, the worse
the prognosis.
Patients with poor LOC should also be monitored for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

heart rate and blood pressure frequently without stress to the patient. Other nursing measures to decrease
ICP include the following:
*Do not occlude the jugular veins.
·Place the head at 30° from the horizontal plane to maximize both venous drainage and arterial supply to
thebrain.
VIIl. Nutrition'5
Any patient that is anorexic or who has not eaten for 3 days or longer is a candidate for malnutrition.
However,particular concern for nutritional insuffciencies include patients with increased metabolic stress
levels, including patients with neurologic diseases or head injuries. The hypermetabolic state rhese types of
patients exhibit results from increased catecholamine releases in order to increase their fuel production.
Unfortunately, the increased metabolic rate and subsequent tissue catabolism rapidly exacerbates weakness in
patients without nutritional support. Even more serious is the loss of visceral proteins, such as serum
proteins, immunoglobulins, and leukocytes, needed to maintain immunocompetence to fight infection.
Undernourished patients are three times as likely as well-nourished patients to have major surgical complica
tions. Wound dehiscence, decubital ulcers, sepsis, and pulmonary complications such as pneumonia may
occur secondary to poor nutritional status. Pediatric patients are especially susceptible to malnutrition and
often present with dangerously low blood glucose levels.
Development of malnutrition can be hospital-related. Frequent diagnostic testing, stress from being
apart from owners, lack of sleep, or unregulated pain can cause a patient to stop eating. Good communica-
tion between the nursing staffshould include a patient's behavior and eating habits during patient rounds.
Other practices known to adversely affect the nutritional status of hospitalized patients include the failure to
record a daily body weight, lack of nutritional intervention after surgical procedures (particularly if the
patientiskept sedated onheavy infusions of analgesia),medications causing inappetence or nausea,and
improper diet types.
Nutritional support to patients with neurologic discases is essential for recovery. Providing nutrition
prevents loss of functional body tissue, as there is no true reserve of protein in the body. The enteral route is
variety of enteral tubes used for patients who have at least some digestive and absorptive capability but who
are unwilling or unable to consume food by mouth. The location and type of feeding tube depends on both
the length of time fecdings are anticipated, as well as the patient injury or illness, Sites of intubation include
nasogastric, nasjejunal, esophageal, pharyngeal, or jejunal. Patients with megaesophagus may require long-
term gastrostomy tubes to eliminate the risk of aspiration. If patients with megaesophagus are fed by mouth,
frequent small amounts of moist“meatballs” are recommended, with the patient eating in an upright
Nasogastric, nasojejunal, and jejunostomy tubcs are most often used when there is danger of pulmonary
aspiration; the pyloric sphincter provides a barrier, which appears to lessen the risk of regurgitation and
 aspiration. Jejunostomy tubes also havc the added advantage of being able to bypass an upper gastrointesti-
nal obstruction. Advantages of thesc particular feeding tubes include ease of insertion, low cost, variability
in size and length of the tubes, radio-opaque insertion stylets, and fenestrated ends to facilitatc case of
nutritional delivery. Nursing responsibilities often include tube insertion (nasogastric and nasojejunal) in
which proper techniques are critical. It is often required to ensure patency after placement by radiographic
techniques, although prior to food administration the tube should always be aspirated for negative pressure
and proper gastric emptying to avoid gastric distension. Suturing techniques are recommended in lieu of
tissue gluc, as nasal and skin erosion cani occur.
Other types of enteral devices include pharyngeal, esophagostomy, and gastrostomyl tubes. Usually
intended for the patient needing long-term nutritional support, general disadvantages of these types of
feeding tubes include the need for anesthesia.Relatively inexpensive,these specialty tubes generally require

the same type of nursing care as other enteral feeding tubes. Regardless of tube type, careful attention to
both maintenance and administration of feeding solutions can prevent many complications. Maintenance of
the tubes requires regular irrigation to maintain patency, particularly after fedings. Diets should be run
through a blender and strained, particularly when using smaller diameter tubes. Very clean techniques in the
handling during both tube placement and dict delivery can help prevent many complications. The skin
around the tube should be cleaned at least daily, inspected for fuid leaks, and the tape or bandage around
the tube changed daily. The tube should be marked with permanent marker where it enters the skin in
order to monitor correct placement. A light bandage or dressing is recommended for most feding tubes to
keep the entry site clcan.If constant rate infusions are required, the administration bag should contain only
a few hours of solution at a time to avoid curdling.
Patient response to feedings is important during administration. Patients that show signs of discomfort
during eeding, such as restlessness, salivation, or omiting, can be exhibiting signs of imprope tub
position. Other potentially serious complications of tube feedings include pulmonary aspiration, diarrhea,
constipation, tube occlusion, peritonitis from improper tube position, and delayed gastric emptying. Such
complications can be avoided by chccking tube placement prior to feeding, measuring gastric residue before
cach fceding, monitoring gastric tubes for migration during daily bandage changes, and evaluating both diet
type and concurrent medications to determine the cause of the diarrhea or constipation.
Bacterial contamination can also occur during enteral tube use. It is important to use clean techniques
during tube placement and handling, to keep opened containers of formula refrigerated and discard after 48
hours, and to routinely change enteral bags and administration lines every 24 hours.

Introduction
The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional
experience associated with actual or potential rissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.” While
many dogs and cats with neurologic disease experience pain, it may be challenging to recognize it in all
paticnts. Pain assessment is somewhat subjective, and the same noxious stimulus may have different effects
in different individuals.
In dogs and cats, treatment of acute pain is much beter characterized than treatment of chronic pain.This
chapter will focus on the physiology of and common pharmacologic options for acute pain managerment and
provide an overview of the current approaches to the treatment of chronic pain in dogs and cats. Pharmaco-
logic treatment of pain should be considered only one part of global pain management, and nonpharmacologi-
The physiology of pain is complex and still not completely understood. Broken down into its simplest
model, the pain pathway begins with nociceptors detecting a potentially damaging (noxious) stimulus and
creating an electrical signal (transduction). This information is then relayed to the central nervous system
(transmission) where the information is integrated and processed. The information is, in turn, relayed to
higher brain centers where it is interpreted as pain (perception).
A.Transduction
Nociceptors are free nerve endings of certain primary afferent, or sensory, neurons. They are distributed
widely throughout the body, being found in skin, bone, muscle, most internal organs, blood vesscs, and
meninges. Noxious stimuli can be chemical, thermal or mechanical in nature. Intense mechanical stimulus,
heat above 43--45°C, and substances such as potassium ions, extreme pH, inflammatory mediators such as
bradykinin or histamine, and exogenous substances such as capsaicin, are all capable of activating nocicep-
tors. Nociceptors can respond to one or more type(s) of stimuli and are often classified by the type of
stimuli thcy transduce.
Activation of nociceptors results in the production of a depolarizing electrical current, or a generator
potential, within the neuron terminal. Ir is likely that ion channels expressed in nociceptors function to
transduce noxious stimuli. Channcls belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family are good
candidates for nociceptive transduction. The transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1)
receptor is a nonselective cation channel, which has been identificed in dorsal root ganglia, spinal, and
peripheral nociceptive nerve terminals. This channel can be activated by heat greater than 43°C, low pH,
capsaicin, and a variety of other proalgesic substances. Inflammatory mediators such as ATP bradykinin,
trypsin, and some prostaglandins potentiate TRPV1 receptor function by activation of protein kinase
signaling pathways within the neuron and subsequent phosphorylation of TRPVl.Additional ion channels
have been implicated in directly transducing noxious stimuli, including those activated by changes in
mechanical stretch or osmolality, ATP-gated ion channels, and acid-sensing ion channels; howevcr, their
exact roles have yet to be fully elucidated.

APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
Nociceptors have the ability to increase their level of sensitivity following tissue injury or repetitive
stimulation. Many channels and receptors cxpressed by nociceptive neurons are not directly activated by
noxious stimuli but instead play important roles in modulating the responses of the primary transducing
ization of the nociceptive nerve terminal has additional effects, such as local release of neurotransmitters,
like the neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP). These neuropeptides
produce vascular leakage and local edema, contributing to the phenomenon of neurogenic inflammation
Bradykinin can now move into tissues from the plasma out of the now“leaky”vasculature, causing further
vasodilation in addition to activating and sensitizing nociceptors. The products of arachidonic acid metabo-
lism, especially prostaglandins, also contribute to this sensitization by having facilitatory actions on nocicep-
tive transduction channels, like TRPV1, and on sodium channcls responsible for transmitting action
potentials. Infammatory cell migration, cytokine production, and degranulation of mast cells with local
release of histamine and serotonin, all exacerbate this response and cause further release of inflammatory
mediators. This sensitized state resulting from a reduction in threshold and increase in responsiveness of
nociceptors is known as peripberal sensitization andcreates the clinically observed phenomenon of primary
hyperalgesia.
receptors are typically coupled to inhibitory Gi/Go proteins, activation of which leads to inhibition of
voltage-gated calcium channels. The effect of this is to reduce the pcripheral nerve terminal calcium ion
concentrations subsequent to creation of a generator potential. This, in turn, reduces the release of neu-
rotransmittcrs such as substance P Overall,the effect is to reduce sensitization of nociceptors, thus provid-
ing analgesia,in addition to having anti-inflammatory actions.
B.Transmission
Primary afferent neurons have cell bodies located within the dorsal root ganglion and some brain stem
nuclei, in addition to peripheral and central processes. The electrical signal generated during transduction
of a noxious stimulus is transmitted from the peripheral axon as a single, or series, of action potentials
through the neuron to the spinal cord dorsal horn. Under physiologic conditions, those primary afferent
neurons responsible for transmission of noxious stimuli are A-delta- and C fbers. Both fber types are
small diameter; however, A-delta fibers are thinly myelinated, thus faster conducting, and mediate what is
typically described as sharp pain,first pain, or superficial pain. C fibers are smaller in diameter and unmy
elinated, therefore they conduct more slowly than A-delta fibers. C fibers are responsible for transmitting
the dullor burning second pain sensation, as well as the type of pain sensation referred to as deep pain
sensation.
Central processes from nociceptive primary afferents terminate in laminae I, Il, and IV of the dorsal
horn, where they synapse with second-order sensory neurons. At these synapses, the primary afferent
neurons release two main classes of neurotransmitters: the excitatory amino acids, primarily glutamate, and
mate, such as NMDA (V-methyl--aspartate) and AMPA (Ω-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolc-4-
proprionic acid) receptors, and target receptors for the neurokinins, neurokinin receptor subtypes 1 and 2
(NK1, NK2). These receptors are all ligand-gated cation channels, and as such their activation results in
depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. There are a number of extrasynaptic receptors which function to
modulatc activity at this synapse. Enhancement of neurotransmitter release by the presynaptic cell is effected
acidB (GABAg) receptors, and serotonergic (5HT) receptors are located extrasynaptically on both the
presynaptic and postsynaptic cell membranes. Activation of these receptors produces analgesia, presynapti
cally by inhibiting neurotransmitter release and postsynaptically by hyperpolarizing the cell, making trans-
mission of the noxious stimulus more difficult.
587
The responsiveness of second-order sensory neurons to stimuli can be altered by many direct and
indirect factors, such that they play a dynamic role in information processing at the spinal cord level. Local
networks of inhibitory and excitatory neurons within the spinal cord (interneurons) modulate the function
of both the primary and secondary sensory neurons. Spinal cord inhibitory neurons use GABA and glycine
as their major neurotransmiters. Both neurotransrnitters act as ligands for ionotropic receptors that function
as chloridc channels (GABAx and GABAc and glycine receptors). In most ncurons, activation of thesc
reccprors hyperpolarizes the cell mernbrane and inhibits ncuronal signal transmission. Additionally, GABA
channels, thus hyperpolarizing the cell menbranc. Removal of GABA-ergic and glycinergic inbibition can
lead to exaggerated nociceptive responses. Inhibition of glycine release from interneurons (adenosine and
nocistatin), reduction (alteration) in transmembrane chloride gradient (reduced KCC2 cotransporter expres-
mcchanisms for developnent of neuropathic pain.
Prostaglandins, in addition to their peripheral actions, can act centrally to cnhance nociceptive transmis-
sion. Activation of intracellular phiosphurylation pathways, for example the action of PGE2 on an. EP2
receptor, initiates an intraccllular pathway that acrivates prorein kinase A (PKA). This effectively reduces
neuronal cell function may underlic some pain mechanisms. Prostaglandins can induce transcriptional and
posttranslational changes in normally non-nociceptive A-β fbers creating in them a nociceptive phenotype
such thar the stimuli those neurons normally transducer-touch now elicits a painful response. This is known
as allodynia.
Once the sensory input from many primary afferents has been integrated by che second-order sensory
neurons, information is transimitted locally to motor systerms to initiate protective reffex responses and
supraspinally in ascending tracts to the brain stem, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. A number of ascending
pathways, or tracts, of neurons convey noxious information to higher centers, including the spinothalamic,
spinomesencephalic, spinocervicothalamic, and spinoreticular racts. The classic spinothalamic tract descrip-
tion in humans is that of a primarily contralateral pathway. Though this pathway is also thought to be
clinically important in dogs and cats, it is a multisynaptic, bilateral pathway in these species (Fig. 18.1),
Supraspinal transmission of nociceptive information initiates autonomic nervous system responses, alerts the
cerebral cortex, and creates the perception of pain. In addition, it also evokes descending modulatory
pathways systems that can both increase or decrease the activity of dorsal horn neurons via interactions with
either or both the primary and secondary sensory afferent neurons
lIll.Assessment of Pain in Aninals
Before pain can be treated,it needs to be recognized.Assessment of pain in animals is not easy; signs can be
subtle and are not usually specific for pain. Pain cannot be objectively proven, so in people it is commonly
considered to be what thc paricnt says it is. In animals, it is what the observer says it is; if the observer is
wrong, the patient may suffer. Thcre is no standard for the assessment of pain in animals. Many scoring

A pain-scoring system needs to be valid, reliable, sensitive, and simple enough to be used in a busy
clinical seting, There are many to choose from, including simple descriptive scales, numeric rating scales,
and visual analog scalcs. It is, however, generally accepted that scoring systems that include assessment of
behaviors and interaction with the animal are best, The American Animal Hospital Association standards for
pain management stipulare thar pain assessmcnt should be considered part of every patient evaluation,
regardless of the presenting complaint. As such, assessment of pain should be considered part of every
physical examination.

If a patient is thought to experience pain, appropriate treatment should be established. In addition to
the ethical obligation to alleviate suffering, there is abundant evidence that untreated pain has significant
deleterious effects. However, clinicians are often reluctant to treat pain due to concerns about undesirable
effects, limited availability of data, and/or misconceptions regarding pain perception and treatment in
animals.Many authors consider pain in animals undertreated.

the initial pain-causing insult has resolved.Acute pain is generally considered a protective mechanism to
Neuropathic pain is a type of chronic pain caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system
as opposed to nociceptive pain, which is pain resulting from the normal result of the stimulation of nocicep-
tors. In addition, exposure to noxious stimulation may result in modifications of perceptions such as
hyperalgesia (increased response to a normally painful stimulus) and allodynia (pain due to a normally non-
painful stimulus), complicating pain assessment and treatment.

Opioids are wicdely used in the managemcnt of pain. They are often considered as the first line of treatrment
for acutc pain, particularly surgical pain. Opioids act on opioid receptors, which are found within the
central nervous system and rnay be expressed or upregulated in peripheral tisstles following trauma or
infammation. Different types of opioid receptors (μl or OP3, 8 or OP1, K or OP2) have been described,
and commonly uscd drugs act on one or more of these rccepror types.
Individuals appear to be unique in terms of number, morphology, and distribution of opioid recptors,
and these differences are genetically determined. Ir is not surprising therefore, that somc individuals experi-
ence much better pain relief from opioid agonists than others. Moreover, some human patients may not
tolerate the side effects or may experience very different levels of pain relief with one drug versus an equian-
algesic dose of another from the same class (e.g., full μ-agonists). Although these phenomena have not been
reported in animals, consideration should be given to trying a different drug in the cases where unacceptable
adverse effect or inadequate pain relief are obtained.
Opioid analgesia is most effective for treatment of acute pain; efficacy for chronic pain is variable. Most
opioids produce dose-dependent sedation and have potential adveise effects such as bradycardia, respiratory
depression, vomiting, constipation, dysphoria, histamine release, hypothermia (dogs), hyperthermia (cats,
drug-dependence), tachycardia (cats, high doses), and hypertension (cats, high doses). Adverse effects afe

doses of opioids, for example as part of a balanccd anesthetic technique (during which mcchanical ventila
tion should be provided). Vomiting is more common with morphine than other drugs. Histamine release is
seen only with morphine and meperidine, and the speed and route of administration plays a role: a greater
degree of histamine release occurs with fast versus slow administration and with the intravenous (IV) versus
intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SQ) routes. Opioid-induced dysphoria appears more common in cats
and associated with the administration of excessively large doses.
Dose recommendations for opioids commonly used in dogs and cats are presented in ‘Table 18.1.
opioids is often based on potency or efficacy of the drugs. It is important to distinguish between potency
the dose), whereas efficacy determines the maximum possible effect (the amounr of analgesia that can be
obtained). For example, butorphanol is more porent but less efficacious than morphine. Pracrically, this
mcans that the dose of butorphanol needed to treat mild pain is less than that of morphine, but that
morphine will he able to relieve severe pain whereas burorphanol will not. In general, all fiull μ-agonists have
similar, high effcacy, whereas partial agonists and agonist-anragonists have lower efficacy. The effects of an
agonist-antagonist, or a pure antagonist (such as naloxone).
Morphine is obtained from the poppy Papaver somniferum and available as an injectable solution for IV,
IM, or SQ administration, as a preservative-free injectable solution for epidural or subarachnoid administra
tion, and as oral preparations. Morphine has a relatively slow onset and duration of effect of 3-4 hours.
Injection of morphine often causes nausea and vomiting, and intravenous administration causes histamine
among the opioid agonists; however, it appears to cause dysphoria in cats more commonly than some other
opioids such as oxymorphone, hydromorphone, or methadone. Morphine is inexpensive, and umtil recently,
was the most widely used opioid in people worldwide. It is a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
schcdule II drug.
Oxymorphone, synthesized fron rnorphine, is a full μ-agonist with 10 times the potency of morphine.
It can be administcred IV, IM, or SQ. Oxymorphone has a faster onsct, a similar duration, and lower

morphine and is a DEA schedule II drug.
Hydromorphone, also synthesized from morphine, is a full μ-agonist with properties similar to those of
oxymorphone. In cats, dysphoria appears to be more frequent after hydromorphone administration com-
pared with oxymorphone, particularly if the higher end of the dose range is used. The use of this drug in
tive to oxymorphone. It is a DEA schedule II drug.
Methadone is a synthetic opioid of the phenylheptylamine class. Its potency and pharmacological
properties are similar to those of morphine.Methadone,howevcr, does not cause histamine release after
intravenous administration, and vomiting associated with its administration is extremely uncommon. Onset
of effect is about 20 minutes after IM or SQ injection, and duration is 3-4 hours. Methadone is cxpensive
in the United States, but inexpensive in Europe. It is a DEA schedule II drug.
Meperidine (pethidine) is a synthetic opioid of the phenylpiperidine class. Its potency is less than that
of morphine and duration of action is short in dogs and cats (1 hour or less at clinically recommended
dosages). Meperidine has significant K-agonistic effects, local anesthetic effects, and may cause CNS excita-
tion. It has anticholinergic-like activities and may increase heart rate. Meperidine blocks the neuronal
or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., selegiline). Use of meperidine in these patients may cause delirium,
hyperthermia,hyper-orhypotension,rigidity,convulsions,coma,and death.Meperidineisinexpensive and
is a DEA schedule II drug.
Fentanyl is a derivative of meperidine, with different pharmacological properties.Fentanyl is a potent μ-
agonist (approximately 100 times that of morphine), which, when used at high doses, can cause significant
bradycardia and respiratory depression.As such,high doses should be reserved for anesthetized,intubated
patients that can be mechanically ventilated, and pretreatment with anticholinergics is recommended.
Duration of action of fentanyl is short, and it is typically given as a constant rate infusion. Fentanyl is

effects of a full μ-agonist. Buprenorphine is 25-50 times more potent than morphine; however, its efficacy
is limited, at least in dogs, where its use should be reserved for treatment of mild to moderate pain. In
contrast, clinical research sugests buprenorphine may be a better analgesic than some full agonists in cats.
Buprenorphine has a high affinity for μ-receptors and may be difficult to antagonize. Even though clinicaly
significant respiratory depression is uncommon after buprenorphine,when observed,mechanical ventilation
may be required due to the difficulty of antagonizing the effects. Buprenorphine has a slow onset (up to 30
minutes after IV administration) but a long duration of action (6-8 hours) and has been shown to be
effective after buccal administration in cats. Buprenorphine is a DEA schedule III drug.
Nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygcnasc (COX), the enzyme responsible for
the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane in responsc to tissue damage and infammation. Some
drugs (ketoprofen, tepoxalin) also inhibit lipooxygenase (LOX), which is responsible for the synthesis of
decrcascd production results in analgesia.Moreover, central mechanisms of pain processing may also rely on
prostaglandin synthesis.
Two isoforrns of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, are known to exist. Classically, COX-1 has been described
to be constitutive and responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in homeostasis (gastric
protection, renal vasodilation, ctc.), while COX-2 is induced by infammation and synthesizes high concen-
trations of the prostaglandins responsible for infammation and pain. Therefore, much research has been
directed toward drugs that specifically inhibit COX-2, which in theory would be almost devoid of adverse
effects. It is not that clear-cut, and COX-1 is now known to contribute to the production of inflammatory
eicosanoids, and COX-2 contributes to production of eicosanoids involved in homeostasis. NSAIDs for
animaluse that preferentially or selectively inhibit COX-2include meloxicam,etodolac, and deracoxib.The
reported selectivity for one COX isoform over another may vary between species and tissue.
NSAIDs are effective analgesics, particularly in cases of acute inflammatory pain. In some studies of
postoperative pain, some NSAIDs were more effective than opioids. The analgesic potency of NSAIDs may
thritic pain; however, they are thought to be devoid of efficacy in the management of othcr typcs of chronic
pain.
Most NSAIDs are available as an oral formulation and some also as an injectable solution.
NSAIDs usually have a long duration of action (12-24 hours) and can be used in conjunction with
opioids.
Adverse effects induced by NSAIDs are related to inhibition of the homeostatic functions of prostaglan-
dins and thromboxanes. They include gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding, renal injury, and inhibition of
coagulation. Therefore, NSAIDs should not be used in animals with a history of gastrointestinal disease,
renal disease, or in those at risk for hypotension or bleeding. Liver toxicity hasbeen reported with carprofen
in dogs. Preoperative administration of NSAIDs is controversial: although it could be argucd efficacy of
these drugs would be greatest if administered before tissue injury and upregulation of prostaglandin synthe
sis, the effects of these drugs on coagularion and renal perfusion should be considered. Cats appear more
sensitive than dogs to the toxic effecis of NSAIDs, in part relared to their relative deficiency in glucuronide
conjugation.
 Dose recommendations for NSAIDs commonly used in dogs and cats are presented in Table 18.2. Only
one drug(meloxicam)is licensed for use in cats in the United States, and the label restricts that use to a
single subcutaneous injection. Other drugs reported in Table 18.2 at this time would be considered off-label
and are for information only.
Ketoprofen is a nonselective COX inhibitor that also inhibits LOX. It is a potent anti-inflammatory and
analgesic drug. In the United Statcs, ketoprofen is available as an injcctable solution and is liccnscd for use
in horses only. In Europe, oral tablets are also available, and the drug is licensed for dogs and cats.

Carprofen is a nonselective weak COX inhibitor. Most of its effects are likely mediated centrally. It is a
potent anaigesic and has been widely used in dogs and cats in many countries. In the United States, carpro
fen is licensed in dogs only. It is available as an injcctable solurion and as oral tablets. The injectable solu-
tion is licensed for IV and SQ use in European countries and Australia, but only for SQ use in the United
States.
Meloxicam preferably inhibits COX-2 and is licensed for use in dogs and cats in the United States.
Meloxicam is available as an oral suspension and injectable solution.'The U.S. label authorizes IV and SQ
administrations in dogs, but only SQ in cats.
Etodolac preferably inhibits COX-2. It is available as tablets for use in dogs.
Tepoxalin is a COX and LOX inhibitor: Its selectivity for COX-2 is unknown in dogs: however, in
sheep, it has a COX-2/COX-1 inhibitory ratio of about 30 (ic., it prefercntially inhibits COX-2). Tepoxalin
is available as tablets for oral use ini dogs.
 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists are ionotropic glutamate receptors. When activated, NMDA
receptors become permeable to cations, primarily calcium. NMDA receptors are involved in excitatory
synaptic transmission, including transmission of nociceptive information. Adelitionally, NMDA receptors
appear to be involved in the central sensitization mechanisms and the development of wind-up.
Dissociative anesthetics (ketamine, tiletamine) are non-compctitive NMDA antagonists acting at a site
within the ion channel of the receptor producing an open-channel blockade. Ketamine has been shown to
produce analgesia at subanesthetic doses and may be effective for acute and some types of chronic, pain.
Ketamine may potentiate the analgesic effects of opioids. Adverse effects of ketamine include rigidity,
convulsions, tachycardia, hypertension, increascd secretions, and increased intracranial pressure. For analgc
sia, the dose recommended in dogs is 0.5 mg/kg IV as a loading dose, folowed by a constant rate infusion
of 2-10 μg/kg/min. Higher doses may bc more effective. Other drugs that antagonizc NMDA reccptors
include some opioids (imethadone, meperidine) and nitrous oxidc.
Alpha-2 adrenocepror agonists (alpha-2 agonists) produce analgesia by stimulating receptors in the spinal
cord dorsal horn and brain stem, where modulation of nociceptive signals occurs. Moreover, alpha-2 ago-
nists exert anti-hyperalgesic cffccts through inhibition of nitric oxide release. Peripheral mechanisms may
also be involved in the analgesic effects of alpha-2 agonists, particularly after nerve injury. Alpha-2 agonists
potentiate opioid-induced analgesia.
The primary indication for the use of alpha-2 agonists in dogs and cats is sedation. It has been reported
that these drugs produce analgesia at doses lower than needed to produce sedation. Two drugs of this
category commonly used in small animals are xylazine and medetomidinc. The analgesic cffects of xylazinc
are reportedly short lived, whereas those of medetomidine are long-lasting analgesia. Alpha-2 agonists may
be efficacious for some types of chronic pain.
69
Adverse effcts of alpha-2 agonists include vomiting, bradycardia, low cardiac ourput, vasoconstriction,
hyper- or hypotension, bypcrglyccmia, and diuresis. Most of these effects are dose-dependent and reach a
ceiling: however, they are likely to be observed even at low doses such as those used for analgesia.
Medetomidine can be used to provide analgesia and sedation, particularly in combination with other
drugs. Doses for that indication are anecdotal. In both dogs and cats, 1-5 μg/kg IM or IV, followed if
combined with opioids.
E. Local anesthetics1.13,22.27,76.77.82,$3,98,105
Local anesthetics exert antagonist effects on voltage-gated sodium channels and as such can produce
analgesia by blocking nerve transmission. Thesc drugs are effective when administered locally, topically, or
systcmically. A revicw of local anesthetic techniques is beyond the purpose of this chapter; however, local
anesthesia should be considercd for painful conditions whenever possible. Transdermal delivery systems are
available for lidocaine, allowing the nouinvasive administration of the drug if a patch can be placed over the
painful area.
Systemic administration of lidocaine has been shown to produce analgesia in various pain models.
Anecdotal cvidence in dogs suggests that a single intravenous administration of lidocaine may relieve some
infusion to treat acutc pain, such as surgical pain. Typical doses are 0.5-2 mg/kg IV bolus or loading dosc,
followed by 30-120 μg/kg/min as a constant rate infusion.
Adverse effects of lidocaine are plasma concentration dependent and involve the central nervous system.
(at lower concentrations) and the cardiovascular system (at higher concentrations). Effects on the central
nervous system include weakness, fasciculations, seizures, coma, and respiratory arrest; effects on the cardio-
vascular system include hypotension, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Cats rnay be more sensitive than dogs
to the toxic effects of intravenous lidocaine. In anesthetized cats, dose-dependent cardiovascular depression
of clinical significance was seen with intravenous lidocaine. Moreover, no analgesic effect of lidocaine could
be demonstrated in cats using a model of thermal nociception.
F.Other8,1624333879.87,89,7.108
Other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have been successfully used to treat chronic
pain in people. Information on the usefulness of these drugs in dogs and cats is anecdotal. Gabapentin, an
anticonvulsant, appears to have been sliccessfully used in dogs to treat some types of chronic pain unrespon-
sive to opioids, including cancer pain. Recomrmended doses range between 10-50 mg/kg/day (usually
divided in two to three administrations), with 30 mg/kg reportcdly being effective. A newer derivative of
gabapentin, pregabalin, may also have some promise as a pain reliever in dogs. Tramadol, a weak opioid
agonist and norepincphrine and serotonin reuprake antagonist,has been used in dogs and cats, both for
acute and chronic pain. No scicntific information on. dose or efficacy is available in cats. In dogs, the
recommended dose is 2-5 mg/kg.
G. Drug combinations47-50.73
Evidence in people srongly suggests that pain can be better controlld when using more than one class of
drugs and by combining pharrmacological with nonpharmacological approaches. This has led to the concept
of multimodal or balanced analgesia. For examplc, clinical experience suggests that better surgical pain
control is achieved when opioids and NSAIDs are combined than when either drug is uscd alone. Similarly
the combinations of opioids and alpha-2 agonists and opioids and NMDA antagonists appcar to havc
synergistic effects. A popular drug cobination in veterinary pracuice is morphine-lidocainc-kctaminc
(MLK). Although such combinations have theoretical benefits by treating pain by multiple mechanisms,
some caution may be necessary: pharmacodynamic and pharimacokinetic interactions are often pootly
studied or not studied at all, and indications are sometimes poorly defined. For example, even though MLK
is widely used for analgesia in both dogs and cats, to date, only one study in dogs is available; this investiga-
18/PHARMACOLOGICMANAGEMENTOFPAINFORPATIENTSWITHNEUROLOGICDISEASE
965
tion examined the effects on anesthetic requirements and not on pain. In addition, the results of that study
did not demonstrate that the combination had any benefit when compared to morphine alone.
H. Sedatives67,95.102.103
Sedation is sometimes necessary in addition to analgesia to treat anxiety or to kcep a patient quiet. Sedation
should never be used instead of adequate pain relief. Since it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between
signs of pain or dysphoria (the latter being an indication for sedation), it is desirable to assume that such
signs are related to pain and to treat accordingly with analgesic drugs. If the condition does not improve or
worsens after administration of high doses of analgesics, it is reasonable to add a sedative.
Drugs commonly used for sedation in dogs and cats include acepromazine and alpha-2 agonists. Alpha-
are mildly tomoderately sedative.Acpromazine, a phenothiazine, is devoid of analgesic effcts. It is a long
acting drug that also causes hypothermia and hypotension for which no reversal agents are available. Doses
used for sedation are 0.005-0.03 mg/kg IV, IM, or SQ in both dogs and cats. The onset is slow (30-45
minutes) after IM or SQ administration. Although acepromazine has historically been considered contrain-
dicated in patients prone to seizure activity, recent cvidence casts doubts on this long-held dogma, especially
when considering theuse of low doses.

Introduction
Neurologic disease in the canine and feline veterinary patient can affct multiple locations, specifically the
brain, the spinal cord, and neuromuscular systems. A multitude of clinical signs can be observed, from
behavior changes to seizures to weakness to paralysis to, simply, pain. The incorporation of complementary
and alternative medicine into conventional medical practice in the human arena is peaking interest on the
subject in veterinary medicine as well. Complementary and alrernative veterinary medicine (CAVM) encom-
passcs a broad spectrum of treatment modalities and includes acupuncture, chiropractic, herbology, light
therapy, and massage therapy. Other therapies such as therapeutic ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and
aquatherapy exist and are used alone or in combination with the treatments mentioned above. The goals of
incorporating complementary medicine practice into conventional practice are to (1) improve the quality of
life of the patient and owner, (2) diminish pain, and (3) incorporate a more holistic view of the veterinary
patient. The use of CAVM in the treatment of neurologic diseasc has the same goals as previously men-
tioned. The use of CAVM for neurologic disease includes selective and adjunctive treatment of seizures,
cerebrovascular disease, vestibular disease, intervertebral disk disease, caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy
myopathics, and neuropathies. Complementary and alternative veterinary medicine may be helpful to those
patients who (1) have nonsurgical lesions, (2) are geriatric, (3) are anesthetic risks, or (4) are recovering
be used in combination with conventional medicine once a definitive diagnosis has been established and all
options are offered to the owner. The goal of this chapter is to familiarize the reader with CAVM and its use
in the treatment of various neurologic diseases that affect companion animals and provide scientific cvidence
for its validity and efficacy.
Acupuncnure has been used for thousands of years and has its roots in Chinese and ancient Indian cultures.
It was first introduced into Western civilization in the early 1900s and has since gained popularity as a
mode of therapy for multiple diseases. Acupuncture revolves around the Eastern theory of Yin, Yang, and
Qi. The theory behind acupuncture involves the stimulation of specific anatomic points in the body to
achieve a therapeutic effect. This scientific theory of acupuncture revolves around the acupoint, of which
there are an estimated 365 on the body surface. An acupoint can vary in size, from 2 mm to 50 mm, and is
composed of a triad of connective tissue, a nerve bundle, and a vascular bundle; this riad has bccn recog-
nized through electron microscopy. Acupoints are joined by theorized meridians or pathways; there are 14
major meridians that run on the body surface and connect the acupoints, which have a very low electrical
resistance. Stimulation of acupoinrs has been shown to stimulate release of infammatory mediators such as
corticosteroids, endorphins, and enkephalins. The scientific basis of acupuncture is being studicd through
multiple National Institutes of Health grants, and there are a number of theories surrounding its efficacy.
Several processes have been proposed to explain acupuncture's effects, focusing mainly on pain.When
acupuncture points are stimulated, the central nervous system (CNS) is stimulated to release chemicals such
as hormones into the muscle, spinal cord, and brain that may help to change the experience of pain and to
promote the body's natural healing abilities. Three main mechanisms are proposed: (1) Conduction of
electromagnetic signals for which stimulated acupoints are thought to be conductors at an incrcased rate,

thus promoting the fow of biochemicals such as cndorpins and enkephalins as well as stimulating immune
system cells;(2) activation of opioid systems,in which several types of opioids may be released centrally
during treatment, thus decreasing pain; and (3) changes in brain chemistry, sensation, and involuntary body
functions by the altering release of neurotransmitters and neurohormones in a positive manner. One theory,
the “gate theory,” is explained in more detail in the Physical Therapy section of this chapter. Acupuncture
therapy can be administered using needles alone (Fig. 19.1), needles and electrical stimulation, acupressure,
aquapuncture (injection of vitamin B or saline into acupuncture points), and low-intensity light therapy
(cold laser therapy). Each modality of therapy is tailored to the individual patient's signs, symptoms, and
temperament, and treatments can be done on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, again depending upon the
underlying problem and goals of therapy. Neurologic conditions amenable to acupuncture therapy include
brain disorders such as epilepsy, head trauma, cerebrovascular events; spinal cord disorders such as nonsurgi-
cal intervertebral disk disease (mostly type 2) of the cervical, thoracolumbar, or lumbosacral regions; and
neuromuscular disorders such as masticatory myositis, CN VII paralysis, and trigeminal neuritis.
II. Chiropractic7841,44
Chiropractic manipulation has been a mode of therapy in human medicine for a number of years and, like
acupuncture, has become very popular in the treatment of companion animals. Chiropractic theory is based
upon manual spinal manipulations and revolves around the relationship and interactions between spine
biomcchanics and neurologic mechanisms. Therapy is aimed at the vertebral column to alter disease progres-
sion. Multiple terminologies are used in chiropractic care. The term subluxation is commonly used and
implies an abnormal positional relationship of the vertebral bodies that can have an effect upon normal
biomechanical and neurologic function. However, multiple definitions arise in the medical and veterinary
601
discussion of chiropracticmedicine.Theoriesregarding thepathophysiology of subluxationsarcnumerous.
The facilitation hypothesis states that subluxations produce a lowered threshold for firing in spinal cord
segments. Other theories inclucde somatoautonomic dysfunction, nerve compression, compressive myelopa-
thy, fixation, axoplasmic aberration, and the neurodystrophic hypothesis, to name a few. Therapeutic
methods include spinal manipulation and spinal adjustment.Spinal manipulation is categorizcd as mechani
cal and neurologic.Again, the mechanical effects are defined as subluxation, characterized as a spinal joint
strain or sprain associated with local and referred pain and muscle spasms. The neurologic effects are both
direct and indirect and affect both the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Spinal manipulation
involves low-velocity, low-amplitude manual thrusts to multiple spinal joints to extend them slightly beyond
their normal passive range of motion. An adjustment is a specifc physical action designed to restore the
biomcchanics of the vertebral column and thus indirectly infuences neurologic function. It is a high-
velocity force applied in a specific direction to a specific vertebrae. In human medicine, chiropractic research
has demonstrated short-term benefits in the treatment of acute lower back pain, headache, and neck pain.
The effects on other musculoskeletal systems are more neutral. Spinal mobilization has been shown to have
a number of physiological effects, including reduction of muscle spasms and inhibition of nociceptive
concepts apply, with multiple applications that range from active movement of the joints berween vertebral
segments to those using low-force techniques. Multiple techniques and treatment theories, ranging from the
role of cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) in spinal column function to potential neuropathology at the intervertebral
foramen,make this treatmentmodality controversial in veterinary medicine.The goal of theveterinary
chiropractor is to divide the spinal column into function or motor units for a more concisc concept of the
biomechanics of spinal movements, malalignments, and adjustments of subluxated segmcnts. A motor unit
comprises two adjacent vertebrae, the intervertebral disk, articular facets, ligaments, muscles, tendons,
nerves, and blood vessels that unite the two vertebrae as one unit. Ihe chiropractic philosophy is based
upon the concepts of homeostasis; this therapy, like acupuncture and other alternative therapies, must be
tailored to the individual patient and performed when an adequate diagnosis has been made and all options
discussed with the client.
Indications for chiropractic thcrapy in the neurologic small animal patient can include (1) spinal
hyperpathia (cervical, thoracolumbar, lumbosacral) in the abscncc of progressive neurologic deficits in cases
of intervertebral disk disease; (2) neuromuscular disease; (3) muscle/ligament, bone, or tendon pain most
commonly associated with underlying orthopedic disease that is either chronic or acute (i.c., traumatic); and
(4) degenerative disease (spondylosis associated with the vertebral column). However, the role of veterinary
chiropractic has not been fully researched in veterinary medicine, anad questions still exist regarding its
indications for use and its true efficacy. It is not, however, a replacement for conventional therapy if the
patient is exhibiting a deteriorating spinal cord condition, such as intervertebral disk rupture causing acute
paralysis,or neoplasia.
IV.Massage Therapy5.7.839.4
Massage therapy in veterinary medicine has increased in populariry within the last 10 years. It is especially
popular in the equine sector, but it is also used quite extensively as a subcategory of physical cherapy in
small animal medicine and surgery. It is defined as the intentional and systematic manipulation of the soft
tissues of the body to enhance health and healing. The primary characteristics of massage are the applica-
hands and the mechanical pressure exerted on cutaneous and subcutaneous structures affect the body.
Enhancement of blood and lymph circulation is achieved, resulting in increased oxygen supply and, in
theory, the removal of endogenous waste products.It is theorized that direct mechanical pressure and its
effects mediated by the nervous systcm can benefit areas ofincreased muscle tension.It is also theorized that
massage stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system. That stimulation can result in relaxation and pain
reduction through two different neural-gating mechanism theories. One, as mentioned previously in the
602
APRACTICALGUIDETO CANINEAND FELINENEUROLOGY
effects of acupuncture, is the gate theory of pain control, which states that a gate or gates exist throughout
the spinal cord. Peripheral pain messages travel to these spinal cord gates and, depending on whether or not
the gates are open or closed, the pain message travels on to the brain where it is recognized. Involved, as
tors, and the A-β, large diameter fibers that are sensitive to touch, pressure, and warmth. Both are theorized
to stimulate T cells in the spinal cord and then send messages to the brain. T-cell activity is also mediated
through the substantia gelatinosa (SG), which is also associated with the spinal cord and receives input from
the A-beta fbers. When the SG is stimulated, the T-cell activity closes the gate. In opposition to this, the
delta fbers sensitive to paininterferewith thisSG activity,thus theT-cell activity is increased and the gate
opens, allowing pain impulses to be recognized by the brain. This theory implies that massage therapy closes
the gate (stimulates the A-beta fibers) and thus decreases the paticnt's pain perception. The second theory
states that massage increases restorative sleep, resulting in the decreased release of substance P, a pain trans-
mitter. Relaxation through massage is thought to decreasc O, consumption and metabolic rate, reduce blood
lactate,decrease blood pressure,decrease muscle tension,and increase blood fow,although reports in
human literature have been mixed.
Massage therapy in veterinary medicine is best used as an adjuncrive therapy. Techniques of massage
include trigger-point massage (myotherapy or myofascial-trigger point massagc), acupressure, ice massage,
effeurages,petrissage and friction,or deep cross-fber friction.In addition,passive movements as part f
massage range-of-motion exercises can be classified as a form of massage because of required hands-on
contact; such movements are performed within the limits of the soft tissue without stretching, and the goal
is to improve synovial joint fluid production and increase joint mobility. The use and benefits of massage
have been described more thoroughly in the equine, but its use in small animal patients is increasing in
popularity.
Neurologic conditions that would benefit from massage therapy as an adjunctive treatment include
patients with brain trauma and cerebrovascular accidents, spinal cord injuries such as postoperative interver-
tcbral disk rupture patients, nonsurgical fbrocartilaginous embolism (FCE) and contussive spinal cord
is to identify the underlying disease process and to institute adjunctive massage during the recovery period.
 Care must be taken to choose the correct patient and the correct initiation and application of the therapy.
V.
Therapeutic Ultrasound5.8,35.37,44
Therapcutic ultrasound is a heat-producing modality effective in post-acute or chronic injury. Ultra-high
frequency, 1 MHz sound waves can transfer energy to the affected tissue's molecular structure, causing an
Oscillatory motion. This oscillation leads to increased temperature in this tissue. Temporatily increased
extensibility of thc soft tissucs (ligaments, tendons, and fibrous scar tissue) can occur with such heating, and
combined with range of motion exercise, can induce improvement. Ultrasound is absorbed by collagen-
dense tissue, and tissues with high fuid content (blood and muscle) absorb sound waves better. Nerves have
a high coeffcient of ultrasound absorption. Ultrasound may prove useful in treatment of peripheral nervc
and muscle injuries when used appropriately.
Ultrasound also is used for its heating effects; this comes from mechanical activity in the tissue as sound
waves increase molecular motion. Increases in tissue temperatures cause an increase in circulation and nerve
conduction velocity.Pain threshold is increased,and metabolic activity is stimulated.Ultrasound can also be
also theorized. Movernent of the ultrasound wave through the tissues produces cellular responses that aid in
the stimulation of tissue repair. Fibroblasts are stimulated to produce morc collagen during the granulation
stage of repair, which begins about 3 days after injury. In addition, the entry of calcium ions that effect
disease in the smallanimal veterinary patient is in its early stages, but it may prove uscful primarily in
diseases of the neuromuscular system (muscle and nerve) and may be of tremendous value in the future.

gaining in popularity and is especially useful (1) in the treatment of neurologic disorders, (2) to promote
wound-healing, and (3) in cases for which there is an aversion to acupuncture needles. Traditional use
includes pre- and postoperativc pain management, biomodulization, soft tissue trauma and edema, wounds,
ulcers, tendonitis, and fascitis. The most common laser types are the visible helium-neon (HeNe) lasers,
invisible infrared (IR) lasers, gallium-arsenide (GaAS) lasers, and gallium-aluminum-arsenide (GaA1As)
lasers. Diode lasers are now being developed for the treatment of myofascial pain. Therapeutic lasers (Fig.
19.2) frst became available in the 1970s, and since 1990, 2500 articles have been listed on Medline regar-
domg low-level laser therapy (LLLT). Low-level laser therapy is a type of therapy that does not causc a
thermal response,but does cause a cellular chemical response.A more correct terminology is the term low-
energy photon therapy (LEP1). Lasers emit electromagnetic waves of 600 to 1000 nm that penetrates tissue;
designed to be used in contact with tissue, and the beam is applied perpendicular to the target. Low-level
laser therapy is absorbed by blood proteins; if gentle pressure is applied, depth of penetration is increased. It
is theorized that LEPT has both anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties,but a correct diagnosis prior to
(APs) and tender local points (AHSHI) points, as well as painful joints, muscles, tendons, wounds, and
ulcers. The neurologic applications of LEPT are aimed at pain management,the treatment of neuralgia
caused or maintained by active trigger points in scars, and trigeminal neuralgia with an emphasis on trigger
points, local AHSHI points, and paravertebral AHSHI points. In past studies, LEPT was theorized to be an
effective adjunctive tool for the noninvasive treatment of peripheral nerve and spinal cord injuries in rats
and dogs. In the author's experience, it is quite helpful in the postoperative treatment of dogs with ruptured
intervertebral disks and associated sof tissue pain and swelling, as well as those animals with neck or spinal
pain that are, through appropriate diagnostics, found to have nonsurgical lesions and normal CSF analysis.
It is not indicated when an underlying compressive lesion is detected that can be corrected surgically.Morc
studies will need to be conducted on the use of LEPT in veterinary neurologic disorders before it becomes a
 standard mode of treatment; however, the future and preliminary results look quite promising.
As mcntioncd above with massage therapy, physical therapy can be used as a beneficial adjunctive therapy in
the rehabilitation process of the neurologic patient. Physical therapy involves the usc of certain physical

measuresin thetreatment and evaluationof diseases.The techniquesused are dependentupon thelocation,
type, and extent of the injury. Techniques include the physical modalities of electricity, light, sound, mag-
neticsheat,cold,manual techniques,and movement.These techniques are thought to benefit or affect th
blood and lymphatic circulatory systems, the neuromuscular system, and intercellular and intracellular
multiple but optimally include the relief of pain and a return to full range of movement and strength. Both
ofthesegoalscanbeaccomplishedwhenexerciseisincorporatedin thetreatmentregime.
Examples of physical therapy modalities can include electrical stimulation, aquatherapy, passive range of
motion exercises, and other physical agent modalities that have been mentioned above and in other chapters
in this text. Electrical stimulation involves the application of electrical currents to an affected area either
directly or through acupuncture needles. The therapeutic electric stimulator (Fig. 19.3) emits a type of
currents that affect muscle and nerve tissues have the longest wave length and lowest frequencies of any
relief, stimulating edema absorption, promoting wound healing, and producing muscle contraction to
decrease atrophy and to reduce spasm.Applications for its use in the veterinary neurologic patient include
dogs with postoperative intervertebral disk disease,brachial plexus lesions with or without resulting sensory
neuropathies, nonhealing lick granulomas, and selected neuromuscular disorders such as idiopathic CN VII
neuropathy,masticatory myositis, and ischemic neuromyopathy.When used adjunctively,electrical stimula
tion can provide pain relief as well as a potentially increased return to at least partial function. In humans,
electrical stimulation has been used on patients with head trauma and cerebrovascular accidents.Aquather-
apy incorporates a wide range of activities, including underwater treadmill and pool exercises such as
swimming. The indications for aquatherapy are wide-reaching and are especially useful for the recovering
neurosurgical patient that needs intensive physical and mental stimulation for a prolonged period. Exercis-
ingin wateris effectiveforimprovingmuscular endurance,muscle strength,cardiopulmonary endurance,
range of motion, agility, and psychological well-being, while minimizing pain.

NEUROTOXICOLOGICAL SYNDROMES
David C.Dorman
Introduction
1.
There are tens of thousands of species of plants, household producis, prescription drugs, and nonprescrip-
tion drugs in the United States that could result in companion animal exposure. On occasion, serious
poisonings, with or without neurologic signs, can occur following exposure to these agents. Unfortunately,
no single document can adequately address even a small fraction of these potentially toxic agents. An
invaluable resource for veterinarians and clients remains the ASPCA's National Animal Poison Control
Center (hrrp://www.napcc.aspca.org), which provides a fec-for-service, round-thc-clock toxicology relephone
hotline (900-680-0000 or 888-426-4435). The centcr can provide veterinarians with specific treatment
protocols and toxicity data for many of these agents.
This chapter will focus on common poisons that are known to induce neurotoxicity in companion
animals. Clinical signs (e.g, seizures) have been used to organize the chapter. This scheme is, however,
simplistic because many neurotoxicants induce multiple effects, and veterinarians may miss critical phases of
the toxic syndrome,

Diagnostic Considerationsl?3
for developing toxicosis if an exposure occurred). Three interrelated factors help establish a toxicological
diagnosis: (l) history of exposure, (2) determination of whether the exposure dose is suficient to induce
not be based upon a single factot (i.c., there are no pathognomonic signs of neurotoxicosis). Several findings
may further supporr a diagnosis of neurotoxicosis, including (1) an acute onset and/or a rapid progression of
neurologic signs in a previously normal animal, (2) neurologic signs in the presence of multiple organ
system involvenent, (3) more than one animal involved, and (4) multifocal involveiment of the nervous
system (i.e., mixed cranial nerve, peripheral nervous system [PNS], and neuromuscular involvement).
diagnosis. Freshly frozen postimortem tissue samples (1-10 grams), including brain, liver, kidney, fat,
gastrointestinal contents, and skin (when dermal exposure occurred), should be colccted for toxicologic
(chemical) analysis. Positive forensic findings are not always definitive proof of poisoning; conversely,
negative findings dont always rule out poisoning. Neurophysiological evaluations (e.g, elecrroencephalogra-
phy [EEG], eleciromyography [EMG], evoked porenrials) may occasionally provide ancillary clinical evi-
dence consistent with poisoning.
Gross and microscopic examinations will soinetimes reveal valuable cvidence, and samples of brain,
spinal cord (cg., cervical and lumbar intumescences), and pcriphcral ncrves (eg., sciatric nervc) should also
stretched to prevent contraction artifacrs. Morphologic lesions are often lacking in many neurotoxic syn-
dromes, hence an abscnce of lesions can be as important diagnostically as their presence. In all cases, the
careful correlation of dara collccted from the history, clinical and neurologic examinations, and supportive
diagnostic tests is used to make a presumptive diagnosis of neurotoxicosis.

II1.Treatment Considerations3454,118
A.Gastrointestinal decontamination
Several reviews of the management of the poisoned dog and cat are available. The basic stratcgies used in
the treatment of a poisoned animal are relatively straightforward and include (1) initiation of lifc support,
(2) reducing the absorption of a chemical and/or enhancing its elimination, and (3) antagonism of pharma-
cologic effects.Unless otherwise indicated, the reader should assume that the administration of an cmctic
(or gastric lavage) followed by activated charcoal and a saline cathartic should be used for recent oral
exposures (ie., ingestion occurred within 2 hours) to the agents discussed in the text. Activated charcoal
powder (14 g/kg), combined with a saline (magnesium or sodium sulfate at 250 mg/kg) or osmotic
cathartic as a suspension in water (10 × volume), should also be administered orally or by gastric tube.
These decontamination procedures are used to reduce gastrointestinal absorption of the poison and thus
decrease the animal's body burden of the toxicant. Common contraindications for the use of cmetics include
(a) ingestion of a corrosive agent; (b) rodents, rabbits, horses, or other species incapable of safly vomiting;
and (c) severe hypoxia, dyspnea, coma, seizures, or other conditions that impair pharyngeal refexes.
Common emetics include syrup of ipecac (dog: 1-2 ml/kg, cat: 3.3 ml/kg, PO), 3% hydrogen peroxide (5-
25 ml/5 kg, PO), apomorphine (dog, 0.03 mg/kg, IV; 0.04 mg/kg, IM), and xylazine (cat, 1.1 mg/kg, IM
orSQ).
B. Control of seizures and central nervous system excitation
Seizures and severe central nervous system (CNS) excitation induced by a wide range of neurotoxicants are
often controlled with diazepam (0.5 mg/kg IV, repeated as needed every 10 minutes for up to three doses).
Other medications (e.g., barbiturates) may be needed when diazcpam fails to control seizure activity. As a
rule, phenothiazine tranquilizers are generally avoided in poisoned animals because they may aggravate CNS
depression and, in some cases, may induce seizures (although evidence for this with acepromazine is ques-
tionable), hypotension, and untoward extrapyramidal effects. More detailed information on management of
seizures is provided in Chapter 7.
C. Control of central nervous system or respiratory depression
Naloxone is specifically recommended for the treatment of exogenous opiate (e.g., morphine, codeine)
toxicosis because it lacks opiate agonist activity.The plasma half-life and duration of action of naloxone is
relatively short (45-90 minutes), thus repeated doses (0.04 mg/kg cither IV, IM, or subcuraneous) are often
required for the treatment of opiate-induced coma. Naloxone has also been used to manage nonopiate-
induced CNS depression (i.e., from barbiturates and benzodiazepines). The value of analeptics (e.g, doxa-
pram,nikethamide) in the treatment of poisoned animals is debatable at best, since it is often difficult to
stabilize patients given these drugs. Potential adverse effects associated with doxapram include hypertension,
arrhythmias,dyspnea,convulsions,and rebound CNS depression
IV.Poisons Associated with Central Nervous System Stimulation and Scizures (Table 20.1)
In this chapter, the term seizures refers to involuntary, paroxysmal brain disturbances, usually manifested by
uncontrollable muscular activity (e.g, paddling), abnormal psychomotor behavior (e.g., fy biting, tail
chasing), autonomic dysfunction (e.g, urination, defecation, and/or salivation), and altered bchavior during
the immediate postictal phase (e.g, CNS excitation or depression). Poisons associated with CNS stimulation
or seizures can include certain avicides (4-aminopyridine (Avitrol), insecticides (e.g., carbamates, lindane and
other organochlorines, organophosphates; pyrethrin and pyrethroids), molluscicides (metaldehyde), insect
repellents (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide [DEET]), rodenticides (bromethalin, sodium fuoroacetate [1080],
strychnine, zinc phosphide), and many other pesticides. Certain drugs (e.g., amphetamines, baclofen, benzyl
alcohol, caffeine, cocaine, 5-fuorouracil, ivermectin, opiates, piperazine), metals (e.g., lead, mercury), and
plants (e.g., water hemlock, daffodils, penitrem, and other tremorgenic mycotoxins) must also be consid-

ered. Fxposurc to these agenrs may result in hyperactivity, hyperesthesia, muscle tremors and fasciculations,
and behavioral manifestations (e.g., aggression). Head trauma may occur secondary to toxicosis-induced
ataxia and seizuires.
A. Amphetamine and Methamphetamine2.,2.3,3:03,143
Sources of amphetamine include amphetamines, methamphetamines, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphet-
amine (MDMA; ecstasy), Amphetamine poisoning most commonly results from the accidental ingestion of
amphetamine-based stimulants., Amphetamine stimulates the release of norepinephrine and other catechol-
amines from the adrenal glands, cerebral cortex, medullary respiratory center, and reticular activating system.
Amphctaminc poisoning can result in severe cardiac and CNS effects. Clinical signs develop within 1-2
hours after ingestion and may include hyperactivity, nydriasis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, lactic acidosis,
hypertension, andinfrequentlyseizures. Although ampheramine poisoning is occasionally recognized in
companion animals, its true incidence may be higher becausc of the reluctance of owners to admit to illegal
drug use. The reported estimated acute oral LDs in rodents ranges from 10 to 30 mg/kg. Ampheramines
may be detected in blood, cerebrospinal fuid, and orher tissue samples. Thc treatment of amphetanine
toxicosis is primarily supportive. In addition to oral decontamination therapy, enhanced amphetaminc
climination may be achieved by ion trapping with urine acidification. Urine acidification is, however,
contraindicated if the anirmal has reduced renal function or if myoglobinuria is present (e.g., sccondary to
muscle damage). Chlorpromazine (10 to 18 mg/kg, IV) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg, IV) given after administra-
tion of a lethal intravenous dose of amphetamine sulfate (10 mg/kg) experimentally reduced the hyperther-
mia severity and also increased survival rates in amphctamine-poisoned dogs. Diazepam rmay also be used to
control seizures and may assist in calming the affcctcd animal.
B. Caffeine, chocolate, and other mcrthylxanthines9,61.10.,104
Caffeine and theobromine are purine alkaloids that are used as stimulants and are found in coffee and
cocoa-based foods. Chocolate is an important methylxanthine source with milk, dark, and baking forms
containing 60, 150, and 450 mg methylxanthine per ounce of chocolate. Toxicologic mechanisms of action
of caffeine, theobromine, and other methylxanthines include inhibition of phosphodiesterase, enhanced
610
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
catecholamine release, adenosine antagonism, or increased calcium entry into the cell. Caffeine toxicosis in
animals most commonly occurs following the ingestion of chocolate; however, accidental poisonings may
also occur from the ingestion of caffeine-based tablets or elixirs. Caffeine is well absorbed from the gastroin-
testinal tract and is nearly completely metabolized by the liver to its inactive metabolites methyluric acid
and methylxanthine. The plasma haif-life of caffine in the dog is approximately 4.5 hours. Clinical signs of
caffeine toxicosis in the dog and cat gcnerally develop within 6-12 hours of ingestion and may include
vomiting ften therst and nly sign),restlssnesshractivityataxiamuse tremrstachycard
cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, polyuria/polydipsia, hyperthermia, cyanosis, and coma. There are usually no
histologic lesions in the brain or spinal cord. The treatment of caffeine toxicosis in animals is usually
symptomatic and supportive. Fluid therapy to enhance diuresis, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, and
repeated activated charcoal administrations are generally recommended. Metoprolol tartrate (0.2~0.4 mg/kg,
PO, bid) is the preferred beta-blocker for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Mild toxicity and seizures
can arise following an ingestion of ≥ 20 or ≥60 mg/kg, respeccively. Despite lient education, chocolate
poisoning remains a common and often seasonal clinical problerm, especially in dogs.
C. Cocaine12,19,47
Cocaine is a natural alkaloid obtained from the coca plant (Erythroxylon coca and Erythroxylon monogynum)
Historically, cocaine has been used in veterinary and human medicine as a topical and local anesthetic and
as a mydriatic. Cocaine ingestion can result in CNS excitation and scizures. The mechanism by which
cocaine induces CNS stimulation is incompletely understood. Depression of cortical inhibitory pathways
has been postulated as one possible mechanism for cocaine-induced neurotoxicity. Catecholamine (e.g,
dopamine) depletion through both inhibition of reuptake as well as increased release by cocaine may also
effects of cocaine overdose in humans and animals. Animal poisoning most commonly results from the
deliberate or accidental ingestion of this ilicit drug in either the hydrochloride or salt form (coke,” “snow,
“blow,”“nose-candy”) or the alkaloid or free-base form ("crack”“rock”“fake”). Cocaine is commonly
“cut” with adulterants (e.g., sugar, local anesthetics, phencyclidine, amphetamine, caffeine)before its illgal
sale, thus cxposure to adulterants may also contribute to the toxic syndrome. Cocaine is rapidly absorbed
from mucous membranes, the gastrointestinal tract, and all parenteral routes and can be found in plasma
within 15 minutes. Cocaine is rapidly metabolized by liver and plasma esterases. Cocaine and its metabolites
are primarily excreted in the urine. Most human hospitals and diagnostic laboratories can confirm cxposure
through measurement of urinary cocaine concentrations.
Accidental poisonings in dogs and cats may result in either CNS hyperactivity or depression, erratic
behavior, coma, seizures, hyperthermia, vomiting, increased salivation, tachycardia, dyspnea, lactic acidosis,
decontamination, seizure control with diazepam,antiarrhythmic therapy).The acute oral lethal dose of
cocainc in dogs and cats is approximately 25-50 mg/kg.
D. 5-Fluorouraci]13,62,65,67,8,114,122,145
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU; Aducil, Efudex, Fluoroplex) solutions and creams are used topically in human
patients for the treatment of solar and actinic keratoses and some superficial skin tumors (e.g., basal carci-
noma). lnjectable forms of 5-FU are also used as cancer chemotherapeutics. Cells with a high mitotic index
and growth rate (e.g., bone marrow stem cells and epithelial cells of the intestinal crypts) are often affected
during 5-FU treatment. Cerebellar ataxia is the most commonly rcported neurotoxic sign in human patients
receiving 5-FU therapy.
Animal poisonings can occur following accidental ingestion of 5-FU-containing creams or solutions or
as a side cffect of therapy following its absorption through intact skin. Toxic and lethal 5-FU oral doses in
the dog have been reported to be approximately 9 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The exact mechanism of
neurotoxicity is unknown; however, there has been speculation that neurotoxicity may be related to the
metabolism of 5-FU to fluorocitrate.Mild transient depressions of white blood cell and platelet numbers are

Adversc CNS effects observed in 5-FU-poisoned animals include scizurcs, hypcrcsthesia, hypcrexcitabil-
ity, nervousncss, muscle tremors, and cerebellar ataxia. Thesc signs often dcvelop within 0.5--5 hours
following 5-FU ingestion. Other comrmonly observed clinical signs include vomiting, diarrhea (occasionally
bloody), pulmonary cdcma, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and death. The develop-
ment of hyperexcitabiliry, trcmors, seizures, rcspiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure (1-3
days after exposure) has bcen dcscribed in the dog following the intravesicular use of 5-FU for treatment of
urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma.
Treatment of 5-FU poisoning is primarily supportive. In addition to oral or dermal decontamination,
fuid therapy anticonvulsants, antiemetics, blood transfusions, and gastrointestinal protectorants are often
indicated.
E. Lead1,9.162,4,52,6,7,8-86,06,10111,126,1590
The incidcnce of lead toxicosis in companion animals appcars to bc decrcasing; ncvertheless it remains an
important clinical problem. Historical sources of lead includc lead-bascd paints, battery plates, cerrain
caulking compounds and putty, linoleum, plumbing solde, roofing marerial, and asphalt. Warer fro lead
plumbing, glazed crockery pots,and streams pollured by lead-contaminated efluent also may contain toxic
concentrations of lead. Among these sources, ingestion of lead-based paints rermains the single most impor-
tant source of companion animal poisoning. Generally, only 5%-10% of ingested lead is absorbed in adults,
but 40%-50% is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in juveniles; thus, young animals are morc suscep-
tible to lead poisoning than are adults. Lead may dissolve to an appreciahlc degrec in the acid cnvironment
do not readily dissolve except in joints or abscesses. Once absorbed, lead readily passes membrane barriers
such as the blood-brain barrier and the placenta. Lead distributcs primarily to the kidney cortex, liver, and
bone, with bone containing most (90%-98%) of the total body lead burden. When the bone becomes
saturated, signs of toxicosis may develop suddenly.
Signs of lead toxicosis are generally referable to the nervous and gastroinrestinal systems. Neurologic
signs with acute onset tend to predominate with higher exposure levels, while gastroinitestinal signs and
chronic illness may be more common with lower exposures; however, both systems may be affected concur-
renely. In decreasing order of frequency, signs in dogs and cats are vomiting, seizures, anorexia, hystcria, and
weight loss. In both dogs and cais, seizures represent the predominant ncurologic sign; thercfore, lead
toxicosis should be considered in any aniinal exhibiting scizures. Electroencephalography changes in dogs
with lead-induced neurologic signs include intermirtent or continuous high-amplitude slow wave activity.
Hysteria is commonly reported and is characterizcd by barking and crying continuously, running in many
directions without purposc, indiscriminate biting of animate and inanimate objects, and other behavioral
changes. Other neurologic signs include ataxia, tremors, and blindness. Dogs may develop aggression,
dementia, pica, megaesophagus, and coma. Cats tend to show more evident neurologic manifestations and
reported in cats. Differential diagnoses based upon history and clinical signs include rabies, canine disrem-
per, epilepsy, encephalitis, spinal cord trauma, and other poisons. Lead poisoning is inore common in dogs
thann in cats.
Blood lead determinations remains the single best indicator of exposure to lead. Whole blood (heparin-
ized or ED'TA-containing tubes) rather than serum should be uscd sincc 90% of circulating lead is bound ro
crythrocytes. Although a valuable indicator of exposure, blood lead concentrations do not reflect the length
of exposurc, toral body burden amount of lead, or sevcrity of clinical signs. Signs of toxicosis may resolve
fairly quickly following the initiation of chelation therapy despite concurrent high blood lead concentra-
tions. Cats may exhibit signs of lead toxicosis at lower blood lead concentrations than dogs. The finding of
numerous erychrocytes with basophilic stippling and/or immature (especially nucleated) erythrocytes

APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
without evidence of anemia is suggcstive of lcad poisoning in the dog. Other causes of nucleated red blood
cells (e.g, endotoxemia, leukemia, splcnic diseases) should also be considered. Lead inhibits the serum
enzyme delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase, resulting in a mcasurable increase in the elimination
of ALA in the urine of lead-poisoned dogs and cats. Determination of ALA urinary excretion has some
merit as a diagnostic test for lead poisoning; however, urinary ALA may be unreliable when the daily intake
of lead is small (e.g., chronic intake). Lead also inhibits ferrochelatase, an enzyme in the heme biosynthetic
pathway. This results in accumulation of protoporphyrin in the red blood cells of lead-poisoned animals and
can be used as a highly sensitive test for exposure to lead. Paint chips or other lead objects within the
gastrointestinal tract helps to rule in lead, but negative findings do not rule it out.
For postmortem diagnosis, fresh-frozen liver and kidney tissue should be submitted for lead chemical
assay. Hlistologic changes potentially induced by lead include renal tubular necrosis and amorphous acid-fast
intranuclear inclusions in hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells. Lesions occur in the CNS (lead
encephalopathy) as well as in the PNS (lead neuropathy). The likely primary lesion in acute huinan lead
encephalopathy is break down of the blood-brain barrier, and similar effects are also observed in animals.
Brain capillaries may be dilated, narrowed, necrotic, or thrombosed, and endothelial cells often swell. The
consequent extravasation of fluid results in cerebral and cerebellar edema. Accompanying these vascular
changes is neuronal necrosis (cerebrocortical and Purkinje cells) with secondary reactive gliosis and astrocytic
scar formation.Neuronal lesions may be caused directly by lead rather than by defectivevascular function
since neuronal necrosis without vascular injury has been observed in acute experimental lead toxicity. In the
PNS, lead neuropathy in humans and experimental animals is manifested by Wallerian axonal degeneration
and segmental demyelination affecting primarily motor nerves.
Trcatment of lead poisoning is directed at controlling scizures and other life-threatening signs, removing
lead fro the gastrointestinal tract, elmination of absorbed lead from soft tissue and bone,and identifying
the source in order to prevent further exposure. Small pieces of metallic lead and lead paint chips can be
or intestine may require endoscopic or surgical removal.
Historically, the most commonly used chelator for lead has been CaNaEDTA. This agent has been
used in a varicty of animal species. In both cats and dogs, CaNa,EDTA is given subcutaneously at 18.75-
27.5 mg/kg, every 6 hours, for 2-5 days. Prior to injection, CaNaEDTA should be diluted to a final
concentration of 10 mg/ml in 5% dextrose solution. Higher concentrations of CaNaED'TA may cause pain
at the injcction site. Intravenous injection may be more effectivc but rcquires additional labor resources.
Continuous CaNa,EDTA therapy should not last more than 5 days because of CaNazEDTA's effects on
normal growth of the intestinal epithelium, enhanced zinc elimination, and nephrotoxicity; however,
multiple treatments are occasionally necesary, and each 5 days of treatment should be followed by a 5-day
rest period.Both the clinical condition of the animal and blood lead measurements are used to deterimine
when to stop therapy. Due to CaNaEDTA-induced increases in zinc elimination, oral zinc supplementation
at 2 mg/kg may be necessary in dogs on low-zinc diets or those given multiple chelation treatments. The use
of sodium EDTA has been associated with deaths in people due to hypocalcemia.
to inpatient chelation therapy, cspccially in animals with persistently elevated blood lead concentrations. D-
penicillamine is given orally at 110 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest. To prevent chelation
of essential metals in the diet, D-penicillamine should be administcred on an empty stomach (30 minutes
before feeding). It may be necessary to divide the daily dose and give it every 6-8 hours or decrease the total
dose to 33-55mg/kg daily if adverse effects such as vomiting,listlessness,or anorexia persist.Antiemetic
drugs may also be administered 30 minutes to 1 hour before the D-penicillamine to reduce vomiting. D-
penicillamine is a well-absorbed oral chelation agent used for the treatment of lead and mercury toxicosis.
D-penicillamine is metabolized by the liver with very little excreted unchanged, and elimination is primarily
via the kidney and liver. Side effects associated with D-penicillamine use include reversible prorcinuria and
hematuria. It may also enhance the absorption of lead from the gastrointestinal tract; therefore, gastrointesti-
20/NEUROTOXICOLOGICALSYNDROMES
613
nal tract decontamination prior to chelation therapy and prevention of further exposure to lead are
important.
The use of 2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; Succimer) has dramatically improved lead chclation
therapy. In contrast to other chelators, DMSA is a relatively selective, orally active, water-soluble chelating
agent. DMSA is used for the treatment of lead, arsenic, and organic mercury toxicosis. In contrast to the
enhanced intestinal absorption of lead induced by D-penicillamine, orally administered DMSA apparently
does not increase intestinal lead absorption and potentially may reduce it. It is still imperativc to prevent
ongoing oral exposure to lead; however, if reexposure should occur (as in an outpatient setting), concurrent
trcatment with DMSA is unlikely to pose a particular risk. Side effects of DMSA are limited. Elevations in
serum alanine transaminase have been reported in humans, but these also may be induced by lead toxicosis.
DMSA appears not to have a clinically significant effect on the excretion of essential minerals including
q 8 hr) for 10 days had reduced blood lead concentrations and eliminated clinical signs of lead poisoning.
Succimer has aiso been used effctivcly in cats poisoned with lead. Thiarnine hydrochloride (2 mg/kg
every 6 hours) may be beneficial in lead-poisoned dogs, although its efficacy has not been. proven
experimentally.
Another factor that should be considered is the possibility that children or adults may also have been
exposed to lead from the same source as their pets. This is especially true if the exposure history includes
possible risk factors for exposure,such as a recent remodeling of an older home that contains lead-based
paints.
E. Pseudoephedrine101,103
Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine with decongestant activity. It is also a common source of
toxicity in dogs and cats. The hydrochloride and sulfate salts of pseudoephedrine are found in many over
rine is structurally similar to amphetamine and shares many of this drug's pharmacologic spectrum.
Pseudoephedrine ingestion can lead to cardiovascular and CNS toxicity. The most common clinical signs
observed in pets include agitation,hyperactivity, panting, hyperthermia,hypertension, tachycardia, head
bobbing, and mydriasis. Life-threatening signs, including seizures, reportedly occur following an ingestion of
10 mg/kg or more. Gross or microscopic lesions are typically absent. Chemical analysis of blood or urine
may be used to confirm exposure. Trearmenr includes gastric decontamination and symptomaric care.
Acepromazine, but not diazepan, has been recommended for the control of pseudoephedrine-induced
agitation and hyperactivity whereas phenobarbital or pentobarbital are used to control severe tremors and
seizures. Beta-blockers, such as propranolol, can help control severe tachyarrhythmias. Clinical signs may
persist for several days.
G. Pyrethrin and pyrethroid insecticides105.127,144.148
Exposure to permethrin and other pyrethrin insecticides remains a common cause of toxicosis, especially in
cats. Pyrethrins are natural insecticides, while pyrethroids (e.g, permethrin and fenvalerate) are more stable
synthctic insecticides. Toxicologic mcchanisms of action of these insecticides include interference with
sodium channcls, enhanced sodium ion conductance, and postsynaptic gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)
receptor-chloride ionophore complex blockade. Pyrethrins and pyrethroids possess low acute oral toxicity to
tinal tract and liver metabolism. Synergists (e.g. piperonyl butoxide, and N-octyl-bicycloheptenc dicarboxi-
mide [MGK 264]) are used to decrease pyrethrin and pyrethroid metabolism and thereby increase their
insecticidal activity.
Toxicosis generally develops within hours of exposure,but may be delayed as a result of prolonged
exposure from dermal absorption or grooming. Clinical signs in cats and dogs include tremors, hypersaliva-
tion, ataxia, vomiting, CNS depression, hyperexcitability or hyperactivity, seizures, dyspnea, and death. The
toxic syndrome is considered reversible in most sublethally exposed animals. with complete recovery gener-
614
A PRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINE NEUROLOGY
ally occurring within 72 hours. In one report of 286 feline permethrin poisonings, increased muscular
activity (tremors, scizures, etc.) occurred in approximately 88% of cases. Death occurred in 10.5% of
poisoned cats; most cats recovered within 72 hours. Gross or microscopic lesions are typically absent with
pyrethrin/pyrethroid poisonings. Chemical analysis for insecticide residues on the skin or in the gastrointes-
tinal tract of exposed animals may be used to confirm topical or oral exposure to these agents. Elevated
tissue concentrations of these insecticides, especially brain and fat, may also help to support a tentative
diagnosis of lethal poisoning. Treatment is largely supportive (washing skin, gastrointestinal tract decontami-
nation, seizure control, Auids, oxygcn, and respiration support). Atropine (0.04 mg/kg, SQ) may diminish
the degree of salivation and diarrhea in pyrethrin- or pyrethroid-poisoned animals. Unlike its use in organo
phosphorus or carbamate insecticide toxicosis,however, atropinc is not considered a direct antidotal therapy
for pyrethrin or pyrethroid insecticide poisoning. Methocarbamol (22-55 mg/kg, slowly IV) has been
recommended for the treatment of tremors.
Corn baits containing 4-aminopyridine are used for the control of starlings, pigeons, and other birds. 4-
dog. 4-Aminopyridine hlocks potassium channels, resulting in increased cholinergic nervous system activity
The ability of 4-aminopyridine to block potassium channels has led to some spcculation that it may be an
effective therapy for multiple sclerosis. Clinical signs in poisoncd animals often develop within several hours
of ingestion and commonly include tachycardia, salivation, tremors, ataxia,and seizures.Death from
respiratory failure may develop within 4 hours of cxposure. Chemical analysis of frozen stomach contents,
liver, and urine is available at some diagnostic laboratories,and residues can be detected in poisoned birds.
Although no specific antidotal therapy exists, anticonvulsants and activated charcoal administration are
recommended.
Animal exposures to organochlorine insecticides (e.g., lindane, codrin, DDT) continue to result in serious
neurotoxicoses.Endrin hasbeen used as an avicide,and toxicosis in the cat can result from secondary
poisoning from ingestion of endrin-poisoned birds. Of the organochlorine insecticides, lindane is of most
toxicologic significance in companion animals. Lindane toxicosis is most commonly the result of the overuse
oflindane-based insecticides on dogs orits inappropriate use on cats. Since lindane use has been curtailed,
the incidence of lindane poisoning appears to be waning. The minimal oral lethal dose for lindane in most
mammalian species ranges from 5 to 50 mg/kg body weight.
Lindane is a DDT-type organochlorine insecticide, and acts by causing partial depolarization by inhibit-
ing normal sodium and potassium ion channel function. Lindane may also affect the GABA receptor-
ionophore complex.As lindane and other organochlorine insecticides are very lipophilic, they are rapidly
absorbed and tend to develop high fat and brain tissue concentrations. Clinical signs of lindane toxicosis
generally develop within 24 hours of exposure. Signs may be progressive or explosive in nature, and com-
monly include CNS excitation, tremors, clonic-tonic seizures, hyperactivity, ataxia, circling, salivation,
hyperthcrmia, and coma. Liver damage is occasionally observed several days after exposure. Electroencepha-
lography changes in lindane-poisoned humans can include increased low amplitude-fast frequency and spike
activities. Treatiment of toxicosis is largely supportive (washing skin, gastrointestinal tract decontamination,
seizure control, fuids, oxygen, and respiration support).
Tremorgens are mycotoxins (secondary fungal metabolites) that contain an indole moiety, presumably
derived from tryptophan, that producc tremors or seizures in animals consuming toxic amounts of contami-
nated foodstuffs. The two tremorgenic toxins reported to cause clinical disease in dogs are penitrem A and
roquefortine, produced by the fungi Penicillium crustosum and Penicillium roqueforti, respectively (although
Penicillium crustosum can produce both toxins concurrently). Sources of penitrem A. and roquefortine
20/ NEUROTOXICOLOGICALSYNDROMES

moldy peanuts, moldy bread, and other stored grains and mixed feeds.
Although the mechanisn(s) of action of tremorgenic toxins is incompletely understood (especially for
roquefortine), known biochemical effects of penitrem A include alterations in the resting potential, end
plate poten.tial, and duration of depolarization of thc nerve cell. Penitrein A also has been shownn to facilitate
been suggested that penitrem A inhibits the inhibitory neurotransmirter glycine. The acutc oral IDso for
muscle trcmors and interinittent seizure episodes for sevcral hours after the onset of clinical signs. Affected
animals will gradually return to normal over 1-2 days. Some diagnostic laboratories have developed
methods to detect pcnitrem A and roquefortine in biological samples using thin-layer chromatography
anticipated to be seen at necropsy or on
histopathology. Secondary traluma is possible as rhe result of seizures. Drugs that increase glycine in the
CNS, including mephenesin or nalorphine, have been shown to abolish penitrem A tremors in mice;
however, the efficacy and safety of these trearments in companionr animals has not been investigated.
Treatment of toxicosis is therefore largely supportive (gastrointestinal tract decontarmination, seizure control,
luids, oxygen, and respiration support).
K. Sodium Auoroacetate (compound 1080)*s.5s,90.93
Sodium fuoroacetate (compound 1080) induces an acute (signs develop within 30-90 minules after
ingestion) syndrome similar to strychnine poisoning. Fluoroacetare undergoes rmetabolism to fluorocitrate, a
potenr inhibitor of thc Kreb's cycle enzyme, aconitase. In dogs, fluoroacerate primarily affects the CNS,
while in cats it also results in cardiotoxicity. In addition to tremors and seizures, vomiting, diarrhea, urina
tion, vocalization, and running fits also commonly develop following ingestion of a lethal dose (0.05 mg/kg
body weight). Episodes of wild running and barking are interrupted by tonic-clonic seizures, opisthotonus,
and paddling. Cats also develop hyperesthesia, salivation, vocalization, muscle tremors, and seizurcs. Death
from respiratory failure typically ensues within 2--12 hours after thc onsct of signs. Gross or microscopic
lesions are typically absent in sodium fluoroacetate toxicoses. Although no spccific antidotal therapy exists,
anticonvulsants and activated charcoal administration are recommended. Fortunately, the use of sodiurn
Auoroacetateis under tight regulatory control in the UnitedStates,and companion aninal poisoning from
the rodenticide has bccome cxtremely rare
L. Strychnine8:31,11.15,139.150
Srychnine acts by competitively and reversibly antagonizing the inhibitory ncurotransmirrer glycine at
postsynaptic sites in the spinal cord and medulla. Inhibition of glycine results in the development of muscle
trcmors, hyperesthesia, seizures, opisthotonus, tetany (sawhorse stance), and extensor rigidity. Clinical signs
usually appear within 10 minutes ro 2 hours folowing ingestion of the poison. All domesticated species are
sensitive to this highly toxic agcnt, with approximate lethal doses ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg body
weight. Initially, the patient may appear apprehensive, nervous, tense, and stiff. The clinical signs observed
during strychnine poisoning (e.g., tetany, “sardonic grin,” sawhorse stance, seizures, opisthotonus) closely
resemble those resulting from tetanus. Unlike tetanus, strychnine induces a rapidly progressive syndrome.
With time, intermitent periods of relaxation become progressively shorter until status epilepticus tevelops.
Violent tetanic seizures may appear spontaneously, or alternatively, a variety of stinuli (e.g., touch, sound,
or bright lights) can initiate seizures. Death eventually results sccondarily to anoxia during the tetanic
seizures or exhaustion. The entire syndrome, if left untrcated, may last 1-2 hours bcforc dcath cnsues. Gross
or microscopic lesions are typically absent in strychnine toxicoses.
Effecrive control of seizures is critical to the management of strychnine poisoning. Along with antricon-
vulsant therapy, glyceryl guaiacolare (5%, 110 mg/kg body weight, IV) or methocarbamol (150 mg/kg body
weight, IV) may be of heneft in strychnine toxicosis. Two to five or more doses of glyceryl guaiacolate
616
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
should be given at intervals ranging from 20 minutes to 6 hours. The time between treatments and the
number of treatments are based on the clinical condition of the animal. The muscle relaxant methocarbamol
has also been used to control strychnine-induced seizures in dogs for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Tachycardia
and vasopressor effects associated with strychnine can be treated with diazepam (0.1-0.2 mg/kg body
weight, IV), phentolamine (0.5 mg/kg body weight, IV), and propranolol (0.5-1.0 mg/kg body weight, IV).
Once the animal's condition has been stabilized and the seizures are under control, gastrointestinal
decontamination with activated charcoal is performed. Strychnine elimination can also be enhanced by
forced diuresis (5% mannitol in 0.9% sodium chloride administered at the rate of 6.6 ml/kg/hr) and
acidification of the urine with ammonium chloride (132 mg/kg body weight, PO). Unfortunately, in many
cases forced diuresis with acidification has minimal benefit.Urine acidification is contraindicated if exer
tional acidosis, myoglobinuria, or metabolic acidosis is present. With proper management, clinical signs
resulting from the ingestion of this rodenticide generally resolve within 24 hours. Some diagnostic laborato-
ries have developed methods to detect strychnine in biological samples using TLC or mass spectrometry
methods. The use of strychnine has been greatly reduced, and companion animal poisoning has become
relatively rare.
V.
Toxicants Causing Paralysis (Table 20.2)
Ataxia, paresis, and paralysis are gait alterations associated with dysfunction of the CNS or PNS. Ataxia is
defined asa failureofmuscle coordination,paresisas a partial loss ormpairment ofmotorfunction,and
paralysis as complete loss or impairment of motor function.Toxicological differential diagnoses for ataxia
and/or paralysis can include natural toxins (black widow spider venom, botulinum, ciguatera, cycad palms,
marijuana, nicotine, saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin, tetrodotoxin); ticks (Dermacentor sp; Amblyoma sp.); drugs
(aminoglycoside antibiotics, amitraz,benzyl alcohol, curare, 5-Auorouracil,hexachlorophene, ivermectin
methionine, succinylcholine); pesticides (bromethalin, DEET, d-limonene, certain organophosphorus
hexachlorophene has been one of thebest studied.
A. Hexachlorophene80.81,124,10,.146
Hexachlorophene neurotoxicity results from the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and reduced
adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Hexachlorophene-induced toxicosis has been reported in dogs and cats
following its overzealous dermal use or from accidental ingestion of hexachlorophenc-based surgical scrubs
or soil fungicides. Dogs (especially neonatal animals) are most susceptible; however, cats and other species
may also be poisoned. The estimated oral LDso in the rat is reported to be 60 mg/kg body weight. Hexa-
chlorophene is rapidly absorbed from both the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. Excessive exposure to
hexachlorophene may result in severe myelin damage and secondary axonal degeneration. Clinical signs of
hexachlorophene toxicosis may include hyperthermia, muscle tremors, apparent blindness, CNS excitation
or depression, seizures, ataxia, hypermetria, and paralysis. Other clinical signs may include bradycardia,
diarrhea, anorexia, salivation, and death secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest. Treatment of hexachlorophene
poisoning involves the initiation of life-supportive measures (e.g., scizure control, ventilatory support); skin
and gastrointestinal tract decontamination (e.g., bathing, repeated administration of activated charcoal,
gastric lavage); and the intravenous use of mannitol and corticosteroids to reduce cerebral edema. The use of
hexachlorophene has been greatly diminished, and poisonings due to this chemical have become quite rare.
B.Baclofen2.15s
Baclofen (Lioresal, Novartis) is a centrally acting skcletal relaxant that is used in dogs (I--2 mg/kg PO, tid)
to reducc urethral resistance. Baclofen mimics the inhibitory amino acid neurorransmitter GABA within the
spinal cord. Its main pharmacological effect is to induce flaccid paralysis of skeletal muscles. Baclofen is
rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak blood concentrations within
several hours.Baclofen has a limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and has an elimination half-time

of 2-4 hours. Baclofen is largely climinated unchanged in the urine, with a smallfraction undergoing
hepatic metabolism (primarily deamination) and hepatobiliary elimination.
Clinical signs of toxicosis generaily emerge within 1-2 hours after ingestion and may last for 1 or more
days.Common clinical signs of toxicosis include vomiting, ataxia, vocalization, disorientation, dyspnea and
respiratory arrest secondary to paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, and seizures.Mild toxicity
(e.g, vocalization, vomiting, and CNS depression) have been reported in dogs following the ingestion of
doses as low as 1.3 mg/kg, with fatalities occurring following ingestion of more than 8 mg/kg. Treatment of
baclofen poisoning includes oral decontamination, fuid therapy, and anticonvulsants. Animals generally
recover within several days following initiation of therapy.
VI. Poisons Associated with CNS Depression, Stupor, or Coma
Table 20.3 lists poisons associated with CNS depression. Central nervous system depression (i.e., obtunda-
tion), stupor, and coma all represent states of altered consciousness.Depression or obtundation connotes a
lethargic animal that is incapable of responding to the environment in a normal manner. A stuporous state
is one in which the animal only responds to painful stimuli. In coma, animals are unconscious and unre-
sponsive to any stimulation. The presence of CNS depression alone is not useful diagnostically since it often.
occurs in any ill or intoxicated animal.Agents that induce CNS depression may also inhibit cardiopulmo-
nary function,resulting in hypotension,respiratory depression, and secondary cerebral hypoxia.
Ivermectin is a naturally occurring combination of the polycyclic lactones 22,23-dihydro avermectin βa and
β,b. Ivermectin is used as an anthelmintic in cattle, horses, and swine and has been approved for the
prevention of canine heartworm infection.Ivermectin toxicosis in dogs and cats often follows the inappro-
priate administration of an ivermectin-based equine anthelmintic by the animal's owner.
Ivermectin neurotoxicity is related to its agonist effects at the GABA-chloride channel. The normally
inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, is found in the CNS of mammals (cerebellum, cerebral and limbic
cortices, extrapyramidal system, and horizontal layer of the retina), whereas GABA acts peripherally in

invertebrates. Iverrmectin potentiates synaptic GABA effccts by enhancing its presynaptic relcasc and by
enhancing the binding of GABA to its postsynaptic receptors.
Although some individuals are extremcly sensitive, any member of a breed or species could become
poisoned with ivermectin if an extremely high exposure were to occur. Ivermectin poisoning typically resules
in. an acute (within 1-6 hours after ingestion) onset of ataxia, muscle tremors, seizures (rarely observed),
disorientation, mild to severe CNS depression, and sometimes coma, which may be prolonged or proceed to
cause death. Some dogs develop mydriasis, decreased menace responsc, and apparent blindness (which with
time is reversible). Vomiting, diarrhea, byperthermia, bradycardia, and sinus arrhythmia have also been
reported. There are no characteristic lesions in ivermecctin-poisoned animals.
Drug transporters can significantly influencc the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of xcnobiot-
ics. P-glycoprotein, the product of the MIR1 gene, is found within the blood brain barrier of mammals
and it cxcludes ivcrmectin and ccrain other drugs from entering the brain. Human MDR1 polymorphisms
havc been described and alter drug pharmacokinetics and a paticnt's susccptibility to Parkinson's disease,
infammatory bowel disease, refractory seizures, and certain other diseascs. Transgcnic mice that lack P-
glycoprotein are more sensitive to the neurotoxic effcts of ivermectin.An MDRI polymorphism has becn
identified in Collies and Australian Shepherd dogs and is thought to be the cause of ivermcctin sensitivity in
these breeds.
Ivcrmccrin is poorly absorbcd from the gastrointestinal tract, and it undergoes limited liver metabolism.
Pcak plasma concentrations are reached within 3 hours after oral adrninistration, and the plasma half-life in
non-Collie breed dogs has been reported to be 23 days. Ivermectin has a wide oral margin of safety yet it
has been reported to be neurotoxic in some (but not all) Collies, Old English Sheepdogs, and other suscep-
tible breeds following single oral doses of approximately 100.-500 μg/kg.
Activated charcoal and a saline cathartic are suggested if an animal has been recently exposed to iver-
mectin by the oral route. Picrotoxin and physostigmine havc bcen advocated as possible antidotes for
ivermectin toxicosis; however, these agents should only be used if life-threarcning signs (e.g., coma) are
present. Dogs with severe signs require intensive supportive therapy but usually recover; however, full
recovery may take up to several weeks. Though considered to have a wider imargin of safety than ivermectin,
inadvertent toxic exposure to related compounds (e.g, moxidectin and milbemycin) has bcen reportcd in

B. Barbiturates28,47,74.125,141
Barbiturate use in human medicine has decreased significantly in recent years, while barbiturates are still
widely used in veterinary medicine. Animal poisoning may be the result of the ingestion of barbiturate-
iatrogenic overdose.Barbiturates have multiple mechanisms of action, ncluding inhibition of calcium
accumulation in neural tissue, inhibition of neurotransmitter release, and GABA-mimetic action within the
CNS.Profound respiratory and CNS depression,general anesthesia,hypothermia,hypotension, shock,
cyanosis, and coma are the predominant clinical signs observed following barbiturate exposure. Death is
usually caused by respiratory arrest.
Barbiturates are commonly classified according to their duration of effect into long, intermediate, short,
distribution is influenced by the lipid solubility of the individual agent. Dependent on species and chemical
form, barbirurates are metabolized extensively by thc hepatic microsomal enzyme system and are also
eliminared by renal excretion. Nonhepatic metabolism (kidney, brain, and other tissues) may also contribure
to the metabolism of some barbiturates.
Termination of biologic activity is by redistribution in the body and side-chain oxidation. Substantial
amounts of phenobarbital are excreted unchanged by the kidney in a pH-dependent process. Treatment of
barbiturate poisoning involves gastrointestinal tract decontamination (e.g., emctics, repeated administration
of activated charcoal, gastric lavage) and the initiation of life-supporrive measures (e.g., ventilatory support,
Huid therapy). Forced alkaline diuresis may also be of benefit in phenobarbital toxicoses. Hemodialysis and
hemoperfusion are also cmployed in severely affected human patients. Redistribution of these drugs from
adipose tissue back to the plasma may cause continucd CNS depression; therefore, repeated paticnt moni
toring is required.
C. Methioninel4,18,45,97
Methionine(d,l-methionine)is an essential amino acid that is occasionally used as a urinary acidifier.
Although poisonings are uncommon, ingestion of excessive amounts of methionine can result in neurotoxic-
ity and metabolic acidosis. The toxicity of methionine is related to its metabolism (by the gastrointestinal.
Hora and animal) to ammonia and other metabolites. Animals with preexisting liver disease are predisposed
to methionine toxicosis.Toxic effects most often include ataxia,CNS depression,lethargy,excessive saliva
tion,and vomiting. Other clinical signs may include ataxia,circling,head pressing,aimless pacing,abnor
mal aggression, somnolence, blindness, seizures, and stupor leading to coma. Cats may also develop severc
Elevated blood ammonia levels are reported to occur during methionine toxicosis. Treatment of
methionine toxicosis is primarily supportive.Fluids containing bicarbonate may be needed for the control of
acidosis.
D. Morphine and other opiates7.30447,8.87131
The opiates are used in veterinary medicine as analgesics, sedatives, and hypnotic agents. Animal poisonings
most often occur following the ingestion of human prescription medications, consumption of illicit drugs,
or from jatrogenic causes. Morphine is an important opiate precursor, which is chemically altered to form
methylmorphine (codeine), hydromorphone, diacetylmorphine (heroin), and oxymorphone.
Opiate biotransformation primarily occurs in the liver, with approximately 50% of a given dose being
excreted as the glucuronide form. Hydrolysis, oxidation, and N-dealkylation may also occur. The toxicity of
opiates is highly variable. In the dog, 100-220 mg/kg body weight of morphine subcutaneously or intrave-
nously represents a potentially lethal dose. Opiate neurotoxicity is primarily mediated through a variety of
receptor-binding sites, including the opiate receptors. Species variation in opiate ffects may be related to
differences in the distribution of opiate receptors in the brain. Clinical signs of opiate toxicosis in animals
initially include increascd salivation,vomiting,defecation,increased respiration, and urination.Central

eral vasodilation and hypotension often develop later. Miosis is observed initially, but as the hypoxia
worsens, mydriasis is seen. In contrast, CNS excitation is seen in cats. Hypothermia is observed in dogs
while hyperthermia is commonly observed in cats. Naloxone hydrochloride is antidotal (0.01-0.02 mg/kg
body weight IV, IM, or SC) and is the drug of choice in the cat or dog for opiate poisoning. Gastrointesti-
nal decontamination (emetics, activated charcoal) and supportive therapy is also indicated.
VII.ToxicantsAffecting theAutonomicNervousSystem
One of the most important neurotransmitters in the nervous system is acetylcholinc. Acetylcholine is
synthesized from acetyl-CoA and choline by choline acetyltransferase. Following synthesis, acetylcholine
functions at the following sites: (1) all preganglionic nerve terminals of the autonomic nervous system, (2)
all postganglionic parasympathetic nerve terminals, (3) the neuromuscular junction, (4) the adrenal medulla,
(5) the CNS, and (6) the postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminal at sweat glands. Cholinergic muscarinic
receptors are linked to second messenger systems via G proteins (so-called metabotropic receptors), and
acetylcholine binding causcs stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nicotinic receptors form
ion channels (i.e., ionotropic receptors) and are located at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles, at
all ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, in the adrenal medulla, and in the CNS. The brief action of
acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is assured by the rapid acetylcholinesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetyl
choline into choline and acetate.
Toxicants listed in Table 20.4 generally induce clinical signs as the result of interference with the
cholinergic nervous system. Stimulation of the autonomic nervous system results in bronchoconstriction,
muscle tremors, stimulation of exocrine glands (e.g., salivation, lacrimation), bradycardia, and CNS effects.
Blockade of the autonomic nervous system depends upon the type of cholinergic receptor involved. Inhibi
tion of muscarinic receptor function (e.g., receptor blockade by atropine) may result in decreased gastroin-
testinal motility,urinary retention,tachycardia, CNS depression or stimulation,hyperthermia,and,at high
doses,coma and skeletal paralysis.Nicotinic receptor blockade (e.g., curare) results in blockade of ganglia
and skeletal muscles resulting in muscle paralysis
20 / NEUROTOXICOLOGICAL SYNDROMES
621
A. Organophosphorus and Carbamate Insecticides1,53
Organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate insecticides are potent inhibitors of acerylcholinesterase
and produce muscarinic (salivation, lacrimation, bronchial secretion, vomiting. diarrhea), nicotinic
(remors, respiratory paralysis), and CNS (seizures, miosis, hyperactivity) effects. Carbamate insecticides are
reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibirors and OP insecticides bind covalently to the enzyme, resulting in
irreversible inhibition of the enzyme. Recovery following exposure to an OP insecticide is therefore
dependent upon the rcsynthesis of acetylcholinesterase. Tolerance to some cholinergic effects of
cholinesterase-inhibiting compounds may be due to compensatory down-regulation of muscarinic
receptors. Poisonings from OP (e.g, chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos) and carbamate (e.g., aldicarb, methonyl,
carbofuran) insecticides are commonly the result of deliberate topical application or accidental
ingestion.
Measurcmcnt of whole blood, brain, or retinal acetylcholinesterase activity is diagnostically usefil in
cases in which an exposure to an OP or carbamate insecticide may have occurred. Depending on the
plasma, retinal, or brain tissue (one hemisphere) should bc frozcn and shipped on ice. The presence of
reduced acetylcholinesterasc activity (less than 50% of normal activity) in blood, brain, or retinal tisstes is
supportive of a diagnosis of OP or carbamate insccticide toxicosis. In contrast to OP insecticides, transient
inhibition by carbamate insecticides makcs assessmenr of acetylcholinesterase activity more difficult, since
acetylcholinesterase activity may be reactivated spontaneously in vivo or following incubarion, during tissue
shipment, following incubation (as occurs with some methods of measuring acetylcholincstcrase activity), or
during storage. In contrast, cholinesterase activity in tissues from OP insecticide-poisoned animals is nof
altered by incubation.
Important dlifferences exist berween dog and cat cholinesterase activity. Feline whole blood cholinester-
ase activity is composed primarily of a pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase) thar is extremely sensitive
to inhibition by OP insecticides. A significant decrease in whole blood acetylcholinesterase activiry is,
therefore, anticipated in a clinicall affected cat suspected of being poisoned with an OP insecticide.
However, reduced blood cholinesterase activiry may also occur in exposcd cats that are not clinically
affected. Therefore, the prognostic value of this test is diffcult to assess. Furthcrmore, signifcant inhibition
of brain cholinesterase activity may occur in cats and dogs with normal blood cholinesterase activity (i.e.,
false negative).
Exposure to the OP insecticide chlorpyrifos in cats has been associated with the development of organo-
 phosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN). The ability of chlorpyrifos to produce OPIDN is not
rclated to acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Although controversial, the postulated mechanism of action in the
devclopmcnt of OPIDN involves the phosphorylation and aging of a second class of esterase, neuropathy
target estcrase (NTE). In the cat, this neuropathy is characterized by a central-peripheral distal axonopathy
("dying back polyneuropathy"). The appearance of clinical signs is delayed for up to 2-3 wecks after expo-
sure. This syndrome is rarely encountered clinically, but when it occufs, it is characterized by ataxia,
hindlirnb hypermetria, depressed conscious proprioception, wcakness, and an ascending paralysis. The list of
differential diagnoses for chlorpyrifos toxicosis should include thiamine deficiency, hypokalernia, and viral,
bacrerial, or fungal meningoencephalitis. Orher OP and carbamate insecricides; pyrethrin, pyrethroid, and
organochlorine insecticides; and other seizure- or tremor-producing neurotoxicants should also be
considered.
Treatment of OP or carbamate insecticide-poisoned anirnals should begin with institution of life-saving
symptomatic therapy. Arropine sulfate (0.10.2 mg/kg, repeat as needed) can be used to alleviate respiratory
distress caused by severe bradycardia and excessive bronchiolar constricrion and hypersecretion. Arropine wil
not, however, abolish the muscle trernors and other signs due to exccssive nicotinic stimulation. The initial
dose of atropine should he divided, with one quarter given intravenously and the remainder given either
subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Since long-term atropine therapy may be required, one should use the
lowest dose that alleviates the dyspnca and bradycardia. The reversal. of exccssive salivation may serve as a
lseful clinical marker of effectivc atropinization; howevet, pupil size is an unreliable indicator of atropiniza-

A PRACTICAL GUIDETO CANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
tion in cats and dogs. The dose of atropine should be decreased or discontinued if tachycardia, gastrointesti-
nal stasis, severe behavioral changes (e.g., delirium), or hyperthermia develop.
Enzyme reactivators are also.used for the treatment of OP insecticide toxicosis. Reactivators act on the
OP insecticide-acetylcholinesterase complex to free the enzyme and restore normal function. These agents
are only effective if covalent binding of the OP insecticide to acetylcholinesterase has not yet occurred.This
covalent binding is referred to as aging and typically occurs within 24 hours of the initial binding of the
insecticide to the enzyme. Many texts suggest that enzyme reactivators are no longer cffective 18-24 hours
after exposure; however, enzyme reactivators may still be useful even after 24 hours. The reason for this is
that freshly synthesized acetylcholinesterase is sensitive to inhibition of activity from insecticide that has not
undergone detoxification. One scenario where this may occur involves dermal exposures in which the skin
and subcutaneous fat may serve as a depository for some insecticides (e.g., chlorpyrifos). Redistribution
from this depot results in continued enzyme exposure to the insecticide with subsequent aging. This newly
formed and inhibited, but not yet aged enzyme-insecticide complex, is the site of action for the cnzyme
reactivators.
Of the enzymcreactivators,pralidoximechloridehasreceived thewidestclinicaluseinveterinary
medicine. Pralidoxime chloride is given (20 mg/kg, IM, repeated every 12 hours) to relieve muscle trernors
and other nicotinic signs and should be continued until these signs are abolished or until additional pro-
longed benefit (lasting more than a day) is no longer observed. Pralidoxime chloride is generally of low
toxicity; however, overdoses can cause tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias.
It is critical that further exposures to OP and carbamate insecticides be avoided until the animal is fully
rccovered. Exposure to another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should therefore not be allowed for up to 4-6
anorexia and may require supplemental feeding to maintain caloric intake. Recumbent animals with
OPIDN should be placed in padded cages to prevent the development of decubital ulcers.
B.Nicotine7.98,107,017149
Several over-the-counter nicotine-based 2- or 4-mg polacrilex chewing gums and replacement transdermal
patches are available in the United States for the treatment of nicotine dependence.Nicotine polacrilex is a
resin complex of nicotine and polacrilin, which is a cation-exchange resin prepared from methacrylic acid
and divinylbenzene. The gum also contains sorbital as a sweetener and buffering agents to enhance buccal
absorption of nicotine. The rate of rclease of nicotine from the resin complex in chewing gum is variable
and depends upon the vigor and duration of chewing. Nicotine transdermal patches typically contain 8.3
114 mg of the free alkaloid. All patches have significant residues of nicotine (2-83 mg) even after 24 hours
of application. Other sources of nicotine include smokeless tobacco, cigarettes (contain approximately 15-
25 mg nicotine), cigars, and related products.
Nicotine is a cholinergic (nicotinic) receptor agonist that exhibits both stimulant (low-dose) and
depressant (high-dose) effects in the PNS and CNS. Nicotine's cardiovascular effects are usually dose
dependent, Nicotine may increase circulating levels of cortisol and catecholamines. Nicotine is extremely
toxic (minimal oral lethal dose in dogs and cats is approximately 10 mg/kg body weight), and toxic effects
develop rapidly after ingestion. Nicotine-induced clinical effects may include tremors, hypertension, tachy-
cardia, tachypnea, vomiting, hypersalivation, CNS depression or excitation, mydriasis, ataxia, weakness,
seizures, and death from respiratory paralysis. Interestingly, dogs that ingested one or two nicotine transder-
malpatches had only vomiting despite nearly complete nicotine absorptionfrom the patch.
Management of nicotine overdose generally involves gastric decontamination followed by symptomatic
and supportive therapy. If vomiting has not occurred following an acute ingestion of nicotine, the stomach
should be emptied immediately by inducing emesis or by gastric lavage. Activated charcoal and a saline
cathartic should be given inmediately following gastric emptying. Activated charcoal should be given evcry
6-8 hours following ingestion of transdermal patches since delayed nicotine release rnay occur. Vigorous
Hluid support and additional appropriate therapy should be instituted if hypotension or cardiovascular
collapse occurs. Seizures should be treated with standard anticonvulsants such as diazepam.Atropine may be
20/NEUROTOXICOLOGICALSYNDROMES
623
given for bradycardia, excessive bronchoconstriction, or diarrhea. Assisted pulmonary ventilation may be
necessary for the management of respiratory paralysis.
C.Levamisole73.108
Levamisole (1-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-6-phenyl-imidazo-[2,1-b]-thiazole hydrochloride) has been used in
veterinary medicine as an anthelmintic, microfilaricide, and immunostimulant. Levamisole is a nicotine-like
ganglionic stimulant, inducing both nicotinic and muscarinic effects at cholinergic receptors, as well as
depolarization of nerve cell membranes. The therapeutic dose of levamisole in dogs is 10-1l mg/kg body
weight. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity may occur at approximately four times this dose. Clinical signs of
levamisole toxicity in dogs may include vomiting, hypersalivation, depression, diarrhea, anorexia, cardiac
arrhythmias, dyspnea, behavioral changes, pulmonary edema, tachypnea, ataxia, muscle tremors, seizures,
paralysis, and death due to respiratory failure. Hemolytic anemia has also been reported in some dogs due
decontamination, seizure control, fuids, oxygen, and respiratory support).
VII1. Neurotoxic Chemicals with Mixed Effects on the CNS
Table 20.5 includes toxicants that produce a combination of nervous system clinical signs. Many of these
agents may produce either CNS stimulation or depression depending upon the exposure dose, the species of
animal involved, and the stage of the toxic syndrome. Some of these agents also attack multiple sites within
the nervous system, leading to mixed clinical effects and signs. Some neurotoxicants with mixed effects will
also impair sensory function.
A. Bromethalin36-42,120
Rodenticides containing 0.01% bromethalin (N-methyl-2,4-dinitro-N-[2,4,6-tribromophenyl]-6-[trifluoro-
methyll benzeneamine) are an important source of neurotoxicity in companion animals. Bromethalin and its
primary N-demethylated metabolite, desmethylbromethalin, are effective uncouplers of oxidative phosphory-
lation. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation results in inadequate adenosine triphosphate synthesis
leading to decreased sodium and potassium ion channel pump activity, which leads to cercbral edema and
elevated cerebrospinal fuid pressure. The reported minimal lethal dose in the cat is 0.45 mg/kg, with dogs
being approximately fivefold to sixfold less sensitive. Secondary poisoning of cats through the ingestion of
bromethalin-poisoned rodents may occur, The onset and severity of clinical signs induced by bromethalin
are dose dependent.

APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
Ingestion of extremely high doses of bromethalin (more than LDso) may result in an acute onset of
CNS excitation, muscle tremors, and seizures.Bromethalin ingestion by dogs and cats, however, more
commonly occurs at lower doses and results in a delayed (1-7 days after ingestion) progressive mixed CNS
moderatc to severe CNS depression, fine muscle tremors, and focal motor or generalized seizures. Severely
affected animals develop both pelvic limb and thoracic limb paresis, which progresses to paralysis with
extensormuscle rigidity,decerebrate posture,loss ofdeeppain perception,uppermotor neuronbldr
paralysis, and patellar hyperreflexia. Less commonly observed clinical signs include vocalization, behavioral
changes (dementia), anisocoria, positional nystagmus, opisthotonus, and death. In this low-dose syndrome
(i.e., dose less than LDso), clinical signs generally develop within 2-7 days of ingestion; however, delays of
up to 2 weeks may occur. With mild poisoning, clinical signs ustuially resolve within 1-2 weeks of onset of
clinical signs, although signs can pcrsist for up to 4-6 weeks in some animals.
Bromethalin may be detected in fresh-frozen fat, liver, kidney, and brain tissue from lethally poisoned
animals that died shortly after ingestion. Bromethalin has also bcen detected in formalin-fixed liver samples
from a human suspected of dying from bromethalin toxicosis. Alterations in routine serum electrolytes and
chemistries are not anticipated. A small increase in cerebrospinal fuid pressure may be noted; however, this
increase is not as severe as that observed with other causes of cerebral edema.Although not specific for
bromethalin toxicosis, EEG abnormalities commonly occur in bromethalin-poisoned animals. These may
include spike and spike-and-wave activity (indicative of an irrtative or seizure focus), marked voltage
depression (indicative of cerebral hypoxia), and abnormal high-voltage slow wave activities (associated with
cerebral edema formation).Bromcthalin-induced lesions are generally confined to the CNS. Gross evidence
of cercbral edema may occur, but it is relatively mild. Histopathologic changes in lethally poisoned animals
include spongy degeneration of cerebrum, cerebellum, brain srcm, spinal cord, and optic nerve white matte1
due to myelin edema. Ultrastructural findings include separation of myelin lamellae at the interperiod lines,
resulting in apparent intramyelinic edema and pronounced cytosolic vacuolation of astrocytes and oligoden-
droglial cells.The myelin lesion is generally not associated with a leukocytic infammatory response, gitter
cell response, or axonal degeneration, and may therefore be reversible.
Trcatmcnts should include the repeated administration of activated charcoal and a saline cathartic to
decrease bromethalin absorption. Smaller subsequent doses of both activated charcoal (0.5-1 g/kg, oral) and
an osmotic cathartic (sodium sulfate, 125 mg/kg, oral) should be given every 48 hours for at least 2-3
days. Dexamethasone, mannitol, and urea have been reported to hc effective in the prevention of experi-
mental bromethalin-induced cerebral edema in sublethally poisoned rats. These treatments, however, proved
relatively inefective in the management of severe bromethalin poisoning in a cat or dog. Diazepam and/or
phenobarbital may be used to control seizures and severe muscle tremors. Many animals recovering from
bromethalin toxicosis exhibit prolonged anorexia and may require supplemental feeding to maintain caloric
intakc. Recumbent animals should be placed in padded cages to prevent the development of decubital
ulcers.
The toxic syndrome induced by bromethalin in the dog and cat must be distinguished from other
neurologic syndromes produced by trauma, neoplasia, cerebral vascular disorders, as well as infectious and
other toxic agents. Similar clinical signs and white matter lesions may occur in hexachlorophene- or trialkyl-
tin-poisoned animals.
B.Marijuana375.13
Marijuana (Cannabis sativa) is a commonly used recreational drug in people. The main active ingredient
found in marijuana is delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Marijuana contains 1%-8% THC. THC acts
on cannabinoid receptors found in the CNS. Cannabinoids also interact with acetylcholine, dopamine,
GABA, histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine, opioid peptides, and prostaglandins. Companion
animal poisoning usually occurs following accidental ingestion of this drug. Plasma THC concentrations
peak within 2-3 hours after ingestion, Common side effects of marijuana toxicosis in animals include CNS
depression,ataxia,bradycardia,agitation,vocalization,vomiting,diarrhca,hypersalivation,tachycardia,

hypotherimia, mydriasis, urinary incontinence, seizures, and coma. In one study of 213 dogs with marijuana
dysfunction; the majority of dogs were Iess than 1 year of age. Clinical signs of marijuana intoxication
typically develop within 1-3 hours of ingestion, and signs may last for 2-3 days. Marijuana poisoning can
be confirmed by cheinical analysis of urinc or blood sainples. lreatment involves minimizing gastrointestinal
absorprion (emetics, activated charcoal, catharics) and initiating symptomatic and supporrive. therapy.
Diazepam is preferred for agitated patients requiring sedation. The prognosis is generally favorahle unlcss
sccondary complicarions (e.g., aspiration pneumonia) occur.
C. Venlafaxine and Orher Antidepressants659,6,71,7276,79,82,91.10,151
Venlafaxine (Effexor, Effexor XR) is a bicyclic antidepressant that acts as a seroronin, norepinephrine, and
dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Both dogs and cats can be poisoned; however, cats appear to be most com-
monly affected·due to their tendency to consume this drug. Clinical signs generally appear within 1-8 hours
after ingestion. Common clinical signs seen in cats include tachypnea, tachycardia, ataxia, and agitation.
The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine (1.l mg/kg orally or rectally up to three or four times a day),
acepromazine, or chlorpromazine have been advocated for the treatment of agitation. Generally, the progno-
sis is good with close monitoring and treatment of signs. The elimination half-life of venlafaxine in dogs is
approximately 24 hours. Since venlafaxine is heavily glucuronidated it is lilkely that cats, a species with
lowcr glucuronidation rates, would elirminate this drug more slowly.
The tricyclic antidepressant medications (TCAs), which. include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protripty-
line, amoxapine, desipraminc, imipramine, and trimipramine represent a commonly used class of human
psychotherapeutic medications used for the rreatment of endogenous depression, childhood enuresis, and
certain phobic disorders. Clomipramine and several other TCAs have found increasing use in veterinary
medicine for the treatment of canine narcoleptic hiypersomnia syndrome, canine narcoleptic cataplexy
syndrome, canine separation anxiery, feline urine marking, fear and anxicty syndromes. Poisonings with the
'TCAs represent one of the most common life-threatening drug ingestion in human patients and poisoning
incidences in animals rmay well be rising.
Dependent on the specific''CA, the typical therapeutic TCA dose in animals and humans fals in the
 sos  q s  o   o
human and veterinary paticnts. At therapeutic oral doses, the TCAs are rapidly absorbed. Massive ingestions
may resilt in prolonged gastrointestinal absorption due to TCA-induced anticholinergic effects that result in
undergo liver metabolism through dermethylation or hydroxylation followed by glucuronide conjugation. In
humans, the TCAs have somewhat variable elimination halflives ranging from 10 to 21 hours.
The TCAs have pronounced toxic effects on the CNS, parasympathetic, and cardiovascular sysrems. In
addition to their atropine-like anticholinergic effects, TCAs also inhibit biogeruic amine (serotonin, norepi-
nephrine) uptake. Clinical signs of TCA poisoning in animals include hyperexcitability, vomiting, CNS
depression, ataxia, mydriasis, muscle tremors, and occasionally seizures. Cardiac abnormalities should also be
anticipated to occur and may include hypotcnsion, cardiac arrhythmias (e.g, sinus tachycardia; ventricular
tachyarrhythmias), pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest, and death. Treatment of TCA poisoning involves the
initiation of life-supportive measures (e.g., seizure control, ventilation support), gastrointestinal tract decon-
not recommended), and the intravenous use of sodium bicarbonate (2-3 mEq/kg) to control signs of
acidosis, tachiycardia, bradycardia, and other cardiac conductance abnormalities.
D. Chlorhexidine's4
Chlorhexidine is used as an antiseptic and disinfectant with veterinary application in the management of
pyodermas, abrasions, superficial wounds, dermatophytosis, and otitis externa. Chlorhexidine has a low
degree of oral toxicity and is only poorly absorbed following either dermal or oral exposure. Permanent
deafness may be observed following the application of chlorhexidine-based otic preparations in animals with
626

a ruptured tympanum. The sensory cell nerve-ending complex is the main target for chlorhexidine auditory
toxicity and may result in degeneration of the afferent nerve terminals and the hair cells in thc organ of
Corti. There is no specific treatment for chlorhexidine toxicosis, although inmediate fushing with saline of
an ear with. a known tympanum ruprure may be of some benefit.
E. Mercury26.52,60,89.99.153
metallic mercury are corrosive in nature and generally do not produce neurologic signs. Inhalation of
mercury vapor may produce acute corrosive bronchitis and interstitial pneumonia and, if not fatal, may be
associated with neurologic signs suich as tremors or hyperesthesia. In contrast, organic mercuric compounds
may produce profound neurotoxicosis. One route of exposure is the ingestion of fish contaminated with
methylmercury. Although frank mercury poisoning has become rare, the possibility of exposure to older
mercury-based fungicides and environmental sources still exists.
Mercury-poisoned dogs and cats tend to exhibit CNS stimulation. Signs reported in dogs include
blindness, convulsions, and involuntary chewing motions. Mercury-poisoned cats may have normal or
abnormal EEG patterns that may precede neurologic signs by 2-3 weeks following low-dose methylmercury
exposureLikewise,altered visual evoked reponses may ocur in dogsweeks prioro theobservation of any
overt signs following long-term exposure to low doses of methylmercury. Clinical signs observed in cats
during the carly stages of this toxic syndrome include mild weightr loss, decreased appetite, and apprehen-
paws of the pelvic limbs to knuckle over. As signs become more severe, cats may exhibit an incrcased pelvic
limb weakness and lack of coordination, ataxia (cerebellar “zigzag” type, with sudden head movements) and
pelvic limb rigidity, compensatory widening of stance, high-stepping gait, and intention tremors. Additional
signs include blindness and a loss of the righting refex and an inability to land on the feet when jumping.
In cats, tonic-clonic seizures are signaled in the preictal phase by a glassy stare and followed by anisocoria,
yocalization, hypersalivation, and urinary incontinence. Intermittent seizure activity continuing for more
than 24 hours may impair vision, but not hearing or segmental reflexes. Cats may also develop changes in
mood, personality, temperament, and behavior. The differential diagnoses include conditions with tremors
and ataxia as the predominant signs, such as those seen in ingestioni of other metals and insecticides, as well
as cerebellar lesions such as those induced by feline parvovirus (panleukopenia).
Whole blood should be submitted for mercury analysis to confirm the diagnosis.Kidney (fresh frozen)
is the best postmortem tissue for mercury analysis. Grossly visible changes in the brain of dogs may include
irregular size reductions in the dorsal gyri of the cerebellum, with widening of the sulci and the subarach-
noid space. Cats may have gray discoloration of the meninges. Histologic features of organic mercury
toxicosis in cats include degeneration of neurons and perivascular cuffing in the cerebrocortical gray matter,
cerebellar focal atrophy of the granular layer, focal spongiosis of the molecular layer, degeneration and loss
of Purkinje cells, and demyelination in the tracts of the dorsal funiculus of the spinal cord.Methylmercury
preferentially damages granule cells of layer 4 in the visual cortex, granule cells in the granular layer of the
cerebelum, and the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia.
With acute oral exposure, emesis is recommended.Further trcatment consists of removing the animal
from the source of the poisoning and initiation of chelation therapy. Once they develop, neurologic signs
may be irreversible and should be controlled symptomatically. D-penicillamine may be used, but only after
the gut is free of ingested mercury and adequate renal function is verified. DMSA most likely will become
the chelator of choice for organic mercury toxicosis.
F. Metaldehyde1,9,12,156,164
Metaldehyde toxicosis most commonly results from the ingestion of metaldehyde-bascd molluscicides. The
mechanism of action of metaldehyde is unknown;however, decrcascd brain serotonin, GABA, and nor-
adrenaline occur in metaldehyde-poisoned animals.Metaldehyde ingestion can also produce systemic
20/ NEUROTOXICOLOGICALSYNDROMES
627
acidosis. Clinical signs of rmetaldchyde toxicosis often develop within 3 hours of ingestion, and commonly
include tachycardia, salivation, tremors, vomiting, hyperesthesia, seizures,hyperthermia, diarrhea, and CNS
depression. In one report of 18 dogs with meraldehyde intoxication, the most common clinical sign was
seizure activity (16 dogs, 89%). Death from respiratory failure and metabolic acidosis may develop fron 4
to 24 hours after exposure. Delayed deaths due to liver failure may also occur 3-4 days following ingestion.
Nonspecifc histologic lesions in the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and heart may be observed.
Chemical analysis of frozen stomach contents, liver, and urine is available at some diagnostic laboratorics. In
addition to anticonvulsants and activated charcoal administration, fuid therapy-control acidosis is also
rccommended.
G. Metronidazolel0,21.03.50.5,106,13,.158
Metronidazole is used in dogs for the rreatmcnt of giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and certain anaerobic infec-
tions. Metronidazole binds to neuronal RNA and inhibits protein synthesis, thereby causing axonal degen-
eration. Dosages associared with adverse clinical signs have ranged from 67.3 to 129.0 mg/kg body
weight/day. Neurotoxicity is occasionally observed in dogs and cats following mctronidazolc trcatmen.t.
Trcatmcnt-rclated clinical signs usually begin 7--12 days following induction of thcrapy. Ncurologic signs
may include sevcre araxia and spontaneous and positional vertical nystagmus. Seizures and a peripheral
neuropathy (paresthesias) are also occasionally observed in human patients. Other signs may include stoma-
titis and glossitis. An incrcasc in CSF protcin may be found in some dogs. Recovery usually occurs within
12 weeks after cessation. of therapy. Much more rapid recoveries from metronidazole toxicity (approxj-
mately 1.5 days) in dogs have been. documented with the use of oral diazepam for several days (see Chapter
9). Well-demarcated and symmetric lesions, consisting of spongiform changes in neurons with pronounced
cytoplasmic vacuolization, may be observed in vestibular and cochlear nuclei, cerebellar nuclei, rostral
colliculus, and olivary nucleus. Treatment is purely supportive.
H. Toluene and Dichlorophen-Based Anthelminricss
Toluene and dichlorophen-bascd anthelmintics are effective against ascarids, hookworms, and some tape-
worms of dogs and cats. This combinarion is available over the counter under a wide variety of trade names
and strengths. The recommended single oral dose for the combination producr in dogs and cats is 220 mg
of dichlorophen and 264 mg of toluene/kg body weight. A dose of only 1.5 times this recommended dose
may result in signs of neurotoxicity. Toluene is rapidly metabolized to benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid
before conjugation with glycine or glucuronic acid to form hippuric acid or benzyl glucuronide. Common
clinical signs reported in suspected toluene/dichlorophen poisoning include ataxia, aberrant behaviot,
mydriasis, vomiting, CNS depression, tremors, hypersalivation, seizures, weakness, and, rarely, death.
Clinical signs commonly developed within 6 hours of ingestion of the combination product, while in most
cases of suspected toluene/dichlorophen toxicosis clinical signs resolve within 24 hours after ingestion with
just supportive care. Thc mechanisms of action of neurotoxicity for these agents are unknown.
1. Zinc phosphide (ZnsP2)21,129,142
Ihis rodenticide has been available since the 1930s, and its usc continues today. The CNS effects of zinc
phosphide are due to an incompletely understood mechanism of actjon. In addition, zinc phosphidc
liberates phosphinc gas upon acid hydrolysis in the stomach, and this gas contributes to the development of
pulmonary edema. Most animals can be poisoncd by 40 mg/kg body weight, depending upon the plI in the
stomach. The onset of zinc phosphide poisoning is rapid, usually developing within 15 minutes to 4 hours
after ingestion of a toxic amount of bait, Death from large doses usually occurs within 3-5 hours, and
animals rarely survive longer than 24-48 hours. Common clinical signs observed during the early phases of
the syndrome include vomiting, anorexia, CNS depression, tachypnea, and abdominal pain, followed by
ataxia, weaknes, and recumbency. Terminally, there may be severe hypoxia, hyeresthesia, running fits,
seizures, acidosis, and pulmonary edema. Animals poisoned with zinc phosphide occasionally develop
rnarked congestion of the lungs, interlobular edema, pleural effusions, gastritis, and myocardial degenera-

tion. In acute cases of zinc phosphide toxicosis, congestion of the liver and kidney may also develop. The
freshly opened stomach from animals poisoned with zinc phosphide has a characteristic odor of acetylene.
No specific antidotal therapy exists; anticonvulsants, activated charcoal administration, and control of
metabolic acidosis are recommended. Breakdown of zinc phosphide to phosphine is retarded by gastric
lavage with an aluminum or magnesium hydroxide gel (e.g., Maalox).

CANINEBRAINATLASGLOSSARY
ThomasF.Fletcher
A
abducent nerve [Levels 8, 9]
The sixth cranial nerve. It exits the medulla oblongata and innervates lateral rectus and retractor bulbi
muscles of the eye. Note: Abducent is derived from the Latin “to lead away,” referring to the lateral gaze for which
the nerve is responsible.
abducent nucleus [Level 9]
The nucleus is composcd of somatic efferent neuron cell bodies that innervate two of the seven exrinsic
muscles of the carnivore cyc. The neurons shift the gaze laterall (lateral rectus m.), and they retract the eyeball in
order to protract the third eyelid (retractor bulbi m.). Note: Abducent is derived from the Latin “to lead away*
referring to the lateral gaze for which the nerve is responsible.
accessory nerve motor nucleus [Level 12]
This column of somatic efferent cell bodies is located in intermediate gray matter throughout most of the
cervical spinal cord. Axons from the nucleus form the spinal root of the accessory nerve (XI) and ultimately
innervate neck muscles (trapezius, omotransversarius, cleidocephalicus, and mastoid part of sternocephalicus)
accumbens nucleus[Level 1]
Located at the base of the septum, the nucleus plays a role in pleasure, addiction, and processing reward
stimuli. Dopamine and seroronin neurotransmitters are associated with neurons comprising the nucleus. Via a
mesolimbic pathway, the nucleus connects with the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain, which contains
neurons responsive to opiates, amphetamine, and alcohol. Note: Accumbens is derived from the Latin word for
"reclining.
ambiguus nucleus [Level 10]
This collection of somatic efferent neurons sends axons through glossopharyngeal (IX) and vagus (X) cranial
nerves to innervate striated muscle of the pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Note: Ambigus is Latin for “doubtful"
(the nucleus appears ambiguous because its cell density is sparse).
amygdala [Levels 2-5]
A collection of nuclei deep to the piriform lobe, the arnygdala is involved in processing and remembering emo
tions, particularly fearful ones and those related to punishment. Note: Amygdala is from the Greek word for “almond".
B
basal nuclei [Ievels 1, 2 captions]
Refers to nuclei located deep within white matter of the relencephalon, as opposed to surface gray matter
(cerebral cortex). Basal nuclei include: caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, putamen, globus palidus, amygdala,
and claustrum.In addition, the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra are commonly designated as caudal
basal ganglia because of their connections with some of the telencephalic nuclei.

APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
brachium of the caudal colliculus [Levels 6, 7]
A band of auditory axons that run from the lateral lemniscus and caudal colliculus to the medial geniculate
body. The axons convey conscious hearing from both ears, but predominantly from the contralateral ear. Note:
Brachium is the Latin word for “arm"; colliculus is Latin for “small hill".
C
caudal cerebellar peduncle [Levels 9-11]
White mattcr connecting the cerebellum to the hindbrain and spinal cord. It contains cerebellar afferent
input from the dorsal spinocerebellar tract (hindlimb), lateral cuneate nucleus (forelimb), olivary nucleus (climb-
ing fibers), vestibular nuclei, and vestibular nerve. It conveys cerebellar efferents to vestibular nuclei and the
reticular formation. Note: Peduncle comes from the Latin “pedunculus", meaning stemlike; like a stalk, the fiber
bundle attaches the cerebellum to the brain stem.
caudal colliculus[Level 7]
This functions as an auditory refex center for head, eye, ear orientation toward a sudden sound. It receives
bilateral cochlear input via the lateral lemniscus.Note: Colliculus is Latin for“small hill."

tract, the motor area of cerebral cortex (upper motor neurons) has direct input to interneurons and efferent
neurons (lower rmotor neurons). The pyramidal tract controls voluntary movement of mainly distal muscles of a
infuencing excitation of second-order projection neurons. Note: Pyramid is derived from Greck.
QR
raphe magnus nucleus [Level 10]
This reticular nucleus is one of several serotonergic nuclei situated along the seam separating right and left
halves of the brain stem reticular formation. Axons from raphe magnus nucleus descend into the spinal cord and
release serotonin in order to inhibit synaptic transmission in ascending pain pathways. Note: Rapbe means “seam",
from the Greek.
red nucleus [Level 6]
Large neurons in this nucleus give rise to the rubrospinal tract, the principal tract for voluntary control of
limbproximalmusculature.Therednucleusreceives input directionfrom thecerebralmotor cortex and fromthe
cerebellum. (Additionally, there are small cells of the red nucleus that projct rostrally to the thalamus and
caudally to the olivary nucleus.) Note: Iron content in the neurons of this nucleus gives it a red appearance,
particularly in primates.
reticular formation [Levels 8, 10]
Anatomically, the term refers to the network of intermixed gray and white matter that forms a background
for prominent muclei and white matter in the brain stem. Functionally, various nuclei of the reticular formation
have important roles, including alerting the cerebral cortex to maintain wakefulness; regulating visccral functions
(micturition,heart rate,respiration, etc.); and producing movement via medullary and pontine reticulospinal
tracts. The latter is spontaneous active and generates muscle tone in limb extensor muscles. Note: The term
rostral cerebellar peduncle [Level 8]
This peduncle is composed predominantly of efferent fibers from interpositus and dentate cerebellar nuclei.
The axons go to the red nucleus and thalanus and are the means by which the cerebellum regulates ongoing
rostral colliculus [Level 6]
This is a visual reflex center (for head, ear, eye orientation toward sudden light).Retinal input arrives via the
optic tract and brachium of the rostral colliculus. The input is bilateral; the two eyes are associated with alternat-
ing layers within the colliculus. The deepest layer gives rise to tectobulbar and tectospinal tracts that effect the
refex for both vision and sound (caudal colliculus). Note: Colliculus is Iatin for “small hill.
646
APRACTICALGUIDETOCANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
rostral commissure [Level 1]
Nerve fibers that connect right and left sides of the rhinencephalon.The rostral limb of the commissure links
bilateral olfactory bulbs via intermediate olfactory striae. The amygdala is linked bilaterally via the caudal limb of
the conmissure. Note: Commissure is from the Latin word for “junction" (the term is used for fibers that cross the
midline).
rostralventromedial medulla[Level 10]
This region of the medulla oblongata is involved in pain modulation, among other roles. Part of the brain's
intrinsic analgesia circuit, it receives input from the periaqueductal gray and sends axons into the spinal cord
to inhibit second-order projection neurons of pain pathways. The region is known to contain opioid-sensitive
neurons.Note:Rostralis derived from theLatin word for “beak”;medulla is from the Latin word for
“marrow.”
rubrospinal tract [Level 8]
Originating from large neurons of the red nucleus, the rubrospinal tract immediately decussates and then
descends through the brain stem and through the dorsal half of the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord. It is the
principal tract for quadruped gait and voluntary movement involving limb proximal musculature. Note: Rubro is
derived from the Latin word for“red."
rubrospinal tract decussation[Level 6]
The rubrospinal tractimmediately decussates before descending through the brain stem and spinal cord
Note: Decussation is derived from the Latin word for “X."
S
septum [Level 1]
The septum (septal area; septal nuclei) forms the medial wall of the rostral end of the lateral ventricle
pleasure center. It receives input from the medial olfactory stria and has reciprocal connections with the hippo
campus, amygdala, hypothalamus, habenula, and the cingulate gyrus. Note: Septum is derived from the Latin for
"enclose."
septum pellucidum [Level 1]
This thin layer is part of the medial wall of the lateral ventricle. It is more or less evident between the seprum
and corpus callosum.Note:Pellucidum is derived from the Latin word for“shine through.
solitary tract [Level 11]
This tract is composed of axons from primary general visceral afferent neurons innervating the pharynx,
middle car, and larynx (glossopharyngcal and vagus nerves). Rostrally, the tract also contains taste fibers, i.e.,
special visceral afferent fibers from facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves. Axons of the tract terrminate in the
adjacent nucleus of the solitary tract. Note: The tracr is named for its solitary profile, surrounded by gray matter
in transverse section.
spinal rootof nerveXI [Level 11]
The rootis composed of somatic efferent axons from the motor nucleus of the accessory nervc.The spinal
root is formed by nerve fibers that emerge periodically from the mid-lateral surface of the cervical spinal cord.
After joining the bulbar root of the accessory nerve (temporarily),the spinal root fibers continue in the accessory
nerve to innervate ncck muscles (trapezius,omotransversarius,cleidocephalicus components, and the mastoid part
of sternocephalicus).
CANINE BRAIN ATLAS GLOSSARY
647
spinal tract of V [Levels 9--12]
The spinal tract of the trigeninal nerve is composed of facial pain and temperature axons. The axons are
from the primary gencral somatic afferent coimponent of the trigeminal ncrvc. Note: Trigeminal is derived from
spinothalamic tract [Levels 48, 10, 11]
The spinothalamic tract is composed of second-order axons of a three-neuron pathway conveying conscious
of the spinal cord (marginal nucleus and nucleus proprius). The axons decussate in the spinal cord and ascend, in
the lateral funiculus and through the brain stem, to terminate in the lateral portion of the ventral caudal nucleus
of the thalarnus.
stria habenularis [Level 2]
Convcys axons from the septal region, rostral thalamus, and rostral hypothalamus to habenular nuclei. Note:
Stria is the Iatin word for "furrow"; babenult is Latin for “small rcin";—aris is Latin for “of the."
substantia nigra [Levels 5, 6]
'This gray matter has compact, reticulared, and lateral divisions, each with a somewhat different role. In
general, the substantia nigra interacts with the basal nuclei circuits concerned with movement. In particular, the
compact neurons are pigmented, and their degeneration is associated with Parkinson's disease. Note: Nigra is the
Latin word for “black.
subthalamus [Level 3]
Located ventral to the thalamus and lateral to the hypothalamus, the subthalamus consists of sevcral nuclei
Because ir generates bursts of ncuronal activity, it may play a pacemaker role in rhythmic movements. In pri-
mates, subthalamic lesions produce hemiballismus. Note: Thalamus is derived from the Greek word for “inner
chamber."
sulcus {Lcvcl 1]
Refers to a surface groove located on the cerebrum, cerebellum, or spinal cord. In the cerebral cortex, sulci
demarcate gyri in the cerebellum, they demarcate folia. Nate: Sulcus comes from the Latin word for
"furrow."
T
thalamus [Levels 24]
'The thalarmus is the source of all input to the cerebral neocortex. Close to three dozen nuclei are included
within the thalamus. The following components are labeled in the Arlas:
rostral thalamic nucleus [L 2] is concerned with affective behavior; it has connections with the hippocampus
and cingulate gyrus.
thalamic external medullary vellum [L 3] is white matter separating groups of thalamic nuclei (an internal
medullary vellum is also prcsent).
thalamic pulvinar nucleus [I1. 4] is thc most caudal thalamic nucleus (except for geniculate nuclei). Damage to
it is associated with attention deficirs.
648
A PRACTICAL GUIDETO CANINEANDFELINENEUROLOGY
thalamic reticular nucleus [L 4] is the thalamic nucleus that does not project to the cerebral cortex. Located
lateral to the external medullary vellum, it contains inhibitory neurons that receive input from the cerebral
cortex and send output to the thalamus.
ventral caudal thalanic nucleus [L 3, 4] relays information from conscious pathways (e.g., spinothalamic tract
and medial lemniscus) to the primary somatoscnsory area of the cerebral corex.The latcral part of the nucleus
deals wich spinal input, the medial part relays trigeminal inforination; taste is most medial in the nucleus.
third ventricle [Levels 2-4]
A narrow chamber within the diencephalons, clerived from the crmbryonic neural cavity. Ir is lined by epen-
dyma, filled with ccrcbrospinal fuid, and covered by a thin roof to which bilateral choroid plexuses are attached.
Rostrally, the ventricle communicatcs bilaterally with lareral ventricles (via intervertebral foramina); caudally, the
ventricle communicates with the mescnccphalic aqucduct. The center of the ventricle is obliterated by the inter-
thalamic adhesion. Note: Ventricle is from thc Iatin for “small belly"
transverse pontine fibers [Levels 7, 8]
Situated superficially on the ventral surface of the pons, the fibers arise from contralateral pontinc nuclei and
proceed to form the middle cerebellar peduncle. They convey information to the cerebelum from motor areas of
the cerebral cortex. Note: Pontine is derived from the Latin word “pons,” which meais “bridge."
trapezoid body [Level 9]
Associatcd with hearing, it is composed of bilateral axous from ventral cochlear nuclei along with ventral
some of the axons synapse in dorsal or ventral nuclci of the trapezoid body. Note: Trapezoid is derived originally
from the Greek word for "table.
trigeminal motor nucleus [Level 8]
T'he nucleus is composed of somatic efferent neuron cell bodies that innervate jaw muscles for mastication,
plus mylohyoideus and tensor tympani muscles. Note: Trigeminal is derived frorn the Latin “tri- " for three and
geminus for “twin".
trigeminal nerve [Level 8]
Cranial nerve V. It innervates muscles of masticarion (somatic efferent fbers) and conveys sensation from the
face (general somatic afferent). Within the cranial cavity, disral to the rigeminal ganglion, the nerve divides into
three branches: ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular. Note: Trigeminal is derived from the Latin “tri- ” for three
and geminus for“twin”.
tuber cinereum [Levcl 3]
Refers to a swollen area on thc ventral surface of the hypothalamus that gives rise to the infundibulum and
hypophysis. Neurons in this region producc relcasing factors that, via the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal
systen, regulate hormone secretion by the adeno-hypophysis. Note: Tuber is the Latin word for “swelling.” and
UV
vagus nerve [Levels 10, 11]
Cranial nerve X. It innervates muscles of the larynx, pharynx, and esophagus (somatic efferent fibers from
nucleus ambiguus) and thoracic and abdominal viscera (visceral efferent fbers from the parasympathethic nucleus
of the vagus). The vagus nerve conveys general visceral afferent fibers and special visceral afferents (pharyngeal
CANINEBRAINATLASGLOSSARY
649
taste) to the solitary tract. The vagus also innervates the external auditory canal (general somatic afferent fibers).
Note: Vagus is the Latin word for “wandering."
ventral funiculus [Level 12]
One of three major bilateral regions of spinal white matter, ventral funiculus refers to white matter localed
medial and venrral to the ventral gray horn. The funiculus contains the fibers responsible for driving extensor
muscle tone and standing (pontine reticulospinal and lateral vestibulospinal tracts). Note: Funiculus is Latin for
"small rope."
ventral horn of spinal cord [Lcvel 12]
Refers to the profile of the ventral column of spinal gray matter when seen in transcction,. The ventral gray
marter conrains motor nuclei (alpha and gamma neurons and interneurons). Note: Venter is the Latin word for
"belly."
ventral pons [Levels 7, 8]
Ventral pons refers to the anatomically distinct ventral region of the pons division of the brain stem. Corrico-
spinal/corticobulbar fibers convcying motor commands run longitudinally through thc ventral pons and send
collateral branches to pontine nuclei. The nuclei give rise to transverse pontine fbers that decussate and bccomo
the middle cerebellar peduncle. Note: Pons is the Iatin word for “bridge."
ventral reticular nucleus [Level 1 1]
The rostral end of this nucleus plays a role in controlling inspiratory breathing. Note: The term, reticular is
ventral tegmental area [Level 6]
Located in the midbrain, larcral to the interpeduncular nucleus, this area conrains neurons with dopaminc
and seroronin neurotransmitters, and it is a target of agents such as cocaine. The arca is part of a pleasurc/reward
circuit, connecting with the accumbens nuclcus. Note: Tegmentum from the Latin word for “covering” is applied
to mid-regions of the midbrain and pons.
vestibular nuclei [Levels 9, 10]
These nuclei generate vestibular refexes. They receive vestibular input both directly from the vestibular nerve
and indirectly from the flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum. They send output to extrinsic eye muscle nuclei
and to neck musclc nuclei (via the medial longitudinal fasciculus) and to limb muscle nuclei (via the lateral
vestibulospinal tract). There are four nuclei: rostral [L 9] and caudal, lateral, and medial [L 10]. The lateral
vestibular nucleus gives rise to the lateral vestibulospinal tract. Note: Vestibular comes from the Latin word for
"entrance court"; parts of thc vestibular apparatus are housed in a bone chamber called the “vestibule."
