signs of shock will vary depending on the severity, the
 degree of compensation and the cause.

 at intervals of 30 minutes or less to evaluate response to
therapy.
Treatment
Treatment of lactic acidosis involves identification and
treatment of the underlying cause. Oxygen delivery can

sodium bicarbonate or buffers for the treatment of meta-
bolic acidosis is not universally recommended. Reversal
 ofthe metabolic acidosis is generally an indication of suc
cessful therapy. An increasing base deficit suggests that
the therapeutic measures instigated are either inadequate
 or inappropriate. It is likely that the profound acidosis
that is often seen after a generalized seizure does not
cause significant physiological compromise per se and

The degree of overriding is underestimated on the lateral

shortening of the vertebral body of L4 and a step in the
ventral surface of the vertebral body. The ventrodorsal
 projection shows an obvious displacement of the
L4 vertebra to the right and the vertebral fracture is more
clearly seen. Orthogonal projections are required to assess
accurately the alignment of the vertebral canal. Note the
 difference in appearance of the spinous processes cranial
and caudal to the fracture. This is due to torsion of the
caudal part of the spine relative to the cranial segment.
The vertebral canal is reduced in width by approximately
30% on the radiographs, but the degree of spinal cord
compression and severity of spinal cord pathology cannot
 be determined without advanced imaging or myelography.

with narrowing of the disc space, reduction in size of the

also vacuum phenomenon within the disc space (arrow).
This is an uncommon but relatively specific feature of
acute disc disease. Despite the high suspicion of disc
 disease based on the radiographic changes, localization
prior to surgery needs to be confimed with either
myelography or advanced imaging. The MR image shows
the typical appearance of an acute disc exrusion, with
amorphous hypointense extradural material lying vental
to the spinal cord and compressing the spinal cord
 dorsally. Note that on the MR image the vacuum
phenomenon is difficult to identify, as mineralization and

dependent part of the lateral venticles and an increase in signal within the periventicular tissue that is not visible on

venticles. In this case the post-contrast images show only minimal/mild enhancement, which is not unusual with intra-

Assessment of the brain
Assessment of brain images on CT and MRI is mainly
based on changes in symmetry (mass effect, loss of
parenchyma), changes in the ventricular system, shape
and size of the cerebellum and the cranial spinal cord.
CT may be of limited value for evaluation of caudal fossa
lesions, especially in larger dogs, due to a beam harden-
ing artefact resulting in hypoattenuating streaks, which
can obscure pathology. It is important to recognize MRI
alterations in signal intensity (grey matter, white matter).
CT images should be evaluated for alterations in attenu-

With CT, the normal contrast enhancement pattern is
similar to that seen on MRI, with contrast evident in
larger blood vessels and in tissues outside the blood-
brain barrier. The choroid plexuses, large veins, pituitary
gland, nasal mucosa, salivary glands and trigeminal nerve
ganglia/periganglionic vascular plexuses should all
enhance in a normal animal. Failure of a lesion to
enhance post-contrast may be due to lack of a blood
supply or an intact blood brain-barrier, but it may also
be due to failure of administration of contrast medium

Ageing changes
 Older animals undergo reduction in brain volume and this
results in mild widening of the sulci and dilation of the
ventricles. Neonatal animals have reduced grey/white matter
contrast compared with adult animals due to incomplete 
myelination at birth
 Anatomical variants
Asymmetry of the cranial vault is not uncommon and may lead
to distortion of the brain. This can hinder evaluation, but is not
significant. It may also make positioning of slices difficult.
Mineralization of the falcine meninges may be mistaken for

The differential diagnosis of brain masses is based on
classification into extra-axial or intra-axial location.
Extra-axial masses arise from outside the neuraxis
(e.g. meninges, skull bone) (88). Intra-axial masses arise
from within the neuraxis (e.g. glial cell tumours) (84).
Intraventricular masses are classified as extra-axial. The
imaging features of masses are non-specific. A mass
lesion is not necessarily neoplastic and other causes
(e.g. granuloma, haematoma) should be considered.
Definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy (stereotaxis,
free-hand or open surgical biopsy).
The diagnosis ofa brain tumour relies on diagnostic
imaging. The aims of imaging an animal with a suspect
brain tumour are to confirm the diagnosis, to screen for
b
metastases either to or from the brain and to aid thera-
peutic planning. MRI also allows identification of the
secondary pathological effects of intracranial masses and
inflammation (e.g. hydrocephalus, vasogenic oedema,
bleeding or brain herniation) (89).
Most primary brain tumours in dogs result in no
changes to the skulland are not visible on plain radiogra-
phy. Meningiomas in cats can be associated with hyper-
ostosis of the calvarium, which can be visualized on
radiographs, as can areas of mineralization of the tumour.
As with any suspected tumour, it is advisable to obtain
thoracic radiographs to screen for pulmonary metastases.

are variable in appearance depending on cellularity and
mineralization. Most extra-axial masses are associated
with marked contrast enhancement. The contrast uptake
by intra-axial masses is variable (from none to marked).
While the mass effect produced by brain tumours is
obvious, delineating the mass is not always easy. In some
cases of diffuse neoplasia (e.g lymphoma or gliomatosis
cerebri) the changes may mimic inflammatory disease.
Definitive diagnosis may require brain biopsy.

Disc protrusions
 Protrusions are common in older dogs and are character-
ized by nodules of low-signal disc material protruding
through the annulus into the ventral aspect of the verte-
bral canal and indenting/displacing or compressing the
spinal cord. Chronic protrusions are often asymptomatic
and are especially common at the lumbosacral junction in
older dogs, but they can occur at multiple sites. Spinal
cord atrophy is commonly seen on MRI associated with
chronic disc protrusions and results in a reduced diame-

 Although various ratios have been proposed to account
for the extra leucocytes and protein in the CSF con-
tributed by iatrogenic haemorrhage, one study has
shown these to be unreliable. Typically, no leucocytes
and little to no protein will accompany the many thou-
sands of RBCs resulting from iatrogenic haemorrhage.
However, when the haemorrhage contributes erythro-

and it is preferable to repeat the procedure. The tap can
be repeated in 24 hours to obtain a new sample.

In a mixed pleocytosis, no single cell type predomi-
nates (102); it contains a mixture of mostly lymphocytes
and large mononuclear cells, with smaller numbers of
 macrophages, neutrophils and, occasionally, plasma cells
and eosinophils. Numerous conditions can be associated
with a mixed pleocytosis, the most notable being GME,
in which the cell counts are often markedly elevated
(average 800 cells/Î¼l in one study).
A lymphocytic pleocytosis is characterized by an
elevated TNCC with >50% lymphocytes. It is the most
common form of mononuclear pleocytosis and usually
consists of a majority of small, mature lymphocytes, with
smaller numbers of reactive lymphocytes and larger
monocytoid cells. It occurs commonly in cases of viral
disease, notably canine distemper virus, in which the cell
count is typically <50 cells/Î¼l, but it can also be associat-
ed with other chronic CNS infections.

Macrophages can be found in CSF and represent a
non-specific reaction to inflammation, haemorrhage or
degeneration. They may be vacuolated and may contain
phagocytosed cells or infectious agents. The presence of
erythrophagocytosis indicates pathological rather than
iatrogenic haemorrhage (106). Plasma cells can also rep-

most often seen in cases of GME, but can also be present
in NME and various infectious diseases.

been associated with inflammatory CNS conditions. Of
particular interest is that CSF levels of IgA are highest in
patients with SRMA. These levels remain elevated during
treatment and in the event of remission. While not entire-
ly specific, the combination of elevated CSF and serum
IgA is a very sensitive indicator of SRMA and may be a
useful diagnostic test if clinical suspicion of the disease is
high, but the standard CSF analysis is normal.
Infectious disease testing
Screening for infectious diseases is often a critical step in
the assessment of neurological disease, especially since
the clinician frequently has to decide in the face of an
immunosuppressive or an antimicrobial drug regimen.

MRI (118, next page) are the diagnostic modalities of

tion of CSF to aid in diagnosis of underlying diseases
should be done with care due to the potential for brain
herniation secondary to elevated ICP. Aspiration of CSF
from an enlarged ventricle (via a fontanelle or hole made
with a trochar), rather than from the cerebellomedullary
cistern, may help to reduce this risk. Use of hyper-
osmolar agents immediately prior to collection may also
be beneficial in this regard.

Management
Glucocorticoids may decrease CSF production, among
other less well-defined effects, and provide long-term
b
management in some cases (prednisolone, 0.25-0.5
mg/kg PO q12h). Other drugs that decrease CSF
production, such as acetazolamide (0.1 mg/kg PO q8h)
(carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) or furosemide (1-2 mg/kg
PO q12h), are less wellevaluated for the treatmentofthis
condition. Osmotic agents (mannitol, hypertonic saline)
may be used to decrease ICP as a short-term therapeutic
measure. Seizure treatment may be necessary in many
cases on a chronic and acute emergency basis.
Surgical treatment involves either resection of
space-occupying mass lesions or placement of ventricu-
loperitoneal (VP) shunts. Optimal indications for man-
agement of VP shunts for dogs has not been well
documented; infection, migration and obstruction of
shunts are common complications, and no evidence of

Focal seizures
Seizureactivity
A focal seizure is due to initial activation of only one part

 ofone cerebral hemisphere or specific region in the fore-
brain, such as the hippocampus (123). Compared with
dogs, cats more commonly exhibit focal seizures. Any
portion of the body can be involved during a focal
seizure, depending on the region of the brain affected
(124). The focal clinical signs may be associated with a
higher incidence of focal intracranial pathological
change in cats, but are apparently quite often associated
with idiopathic epilepsy in dogs. If there is an alteration
in the animal's awareness during the event, it is called a
complex focal seizure (previously termed psychomotor
seizures).
The various forms of focal seizure depend on where
 in the forebrain the neurotransmission abnormality
occurs. These forms include:
 Focal motor seizures. These are (l) elementary

form of seizure activity frequendy throughout the day.
â  Focal autonomic seizures. These seizures are
apparently rare and cause predominantly autonomic
signs such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal
 pain. A syndrome characterized by drooling,
dysphagia and painful enlargement of the
mandibular salivary glands is probably a form of
focal autonomic seizure.
A seizure may start focally and ultimately spread
throughout both cerebral hemispheres, resulting in sec-
 ondary generalization, which the owner may not notice
until the animal has exhibited several such events.

 Symptomatic seizures. This term is often used to
describe seizures resulting from a structural intra-
cranial cause (e.g. brain tumours [128], inflamma-
tion or hydrocephalus [129]], which causes
structural damage to the forebrain. A seizure focus
that is not compatible with an idiopathic origin, but
is not readily identifiable as a structural defect on
MRI and CSF analysis, is referred to as cryptogenic.
 Reactive seizures. This term is often used to
describe seizures resulting from an extracranial
cause and includes metabolic and toxic disorders. As
mentioned above, these ultimately cause seizure

metabolism or, more directly, as primary neurotoxic
insults. There are no identifiable structural abnor-

Excitement or eating, which often causes a loss of consciousness
and/or collapse, should prompt the thought of narcolepsy/cataplexy.
Several documented events occur during sleep, such as the REM
 sleep disorder. Exercise/excitement may be the trigger for the
syndromes described in Cavaliers and Scotties as well as many NM
diseases and hypoglycaemic-related collapse. Rarely, seizure events
will be triggered by a specific noise or action. Events seen more than
8hours after last feeding may suggest hypoglycaemic collapse
Is the animal normal in between the events?
Any abnormalities described in between the episodes could indicate
a structural CNS or neuropathic or myopathic disease. Metabolic and
cardiovascular diseases may be associated with a waxing and
waning clinical course, with some abnormalities detectable in
between the acute events
Are any other littermates known to be affected?
Breed-associated events may be seen in related siblings: however,
 underlying infectious diseases and toxicities should not be ignored
Is the animal stiff or floppy at the time of the event?
Stiffness at the time of the event would often imply either a seizure
event, a movement disorder or a myopathy. A floppy animal at the
time of the event could also be a myopathy, but could also indicate
a cardiovascular or metabolic disease
Are the gums pale at the time of the event?
Mucous membrane pallor could well indicate a cardiovascular

NEUROANATOMICAL BASIS OF NEURO-
MUSCULAR CAUSES OF WEAKNESS
AND COLLAPSE
Knowledge of the basic physiology of nerve and muscle
function is essential for comprehending their dysfunc-
tion. The physiology of the NM system can be divided
into two main areas:
* Ion function. Ions such as sodium, potassium
 and calcium are essential for impulse generation
and transmission and for the mechanism of muscle
contraction.
 Energy metabolism of myofibres. Normal energy

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR
NEUROMUSCULAR WEAKNESS AND COLLAPSE
The differential diagnoses to be considered depend on
the lesion localization in addition to the signalment,
history and response to previous treatment attempts. For
this reason, the potential NM causes ofacute generalized
weakness and collapse need to be considered separately
by dividing them into:
Â·Neuropathies.
* Junctionopathies (NM transmission diseases).
Â·Myopathies.
Specific diagnostic tests
The tests listed below and in Table 48 (p. 186) should be
considered in any case of acute exercise-associated weak-

ataxia is most frequenty seen with spinal cord lesions, due to disruption of ascending projections in the dorsal and

Vestibular ataxia may result from lesions within the inner ear or vestibular nuclei, which are located in the medulla
oblongata. Head ilt, leaning, falling and a broad-based gait are characteristic. The cerebellum receives proprioceptive
and upper motor neuron projections. It serves to smooth movements via modulating upper motor neuron tone. Lesions

uation and postural reaction testing help to identify
which limbs are involved. Muscle tone and segmental
spinal reflexes are then tested on each abnormal limb to
 determine if the lesion is UMN or LMN in nature. Spe-
cific postural reaction tests can be selected based on the
size and cooperation of the patient (see Chapter l).
3. Evaluation of muscle tone and segmental spinal
reflexes
Muscle tone should be assessed by flexing and extending
the limb and joints (167). Although increased resistance
is indicative of UMN signs, it can also be seen in animals
that are fractious, excitable or in pain, as well as in associ-
ation with LMN paresis affecting the flexor system.
Diminished tone is a hallmark of LMN sign s.
Segmental spinal reflexes should be performed in
lateral recumbency with the non-dependent limb being
tested. Responses graded as absent or depressed indicate
LMIN dysfinction, while responses graded as normal or
 exaggerated indicate UMN dysfunction. Specific spinal
reflexes that should be examined include the patellar,

reflexes, such as the triceps, biceps, and gastrocnemius,
may be tested, but it should be remembered that these
reflexes are inconsistent and therefore unreliable, even in
normal animals.

movement, tail tone and sensation. Bladder and urethral

Management
Treatment of the underlying cause is essential. For
increased ICP, mannitol (0.5-2.0 g/kg IV) can be given
over 15 minutes and repeated in 30 minutes. Furosemide
(0.5-1.0 mg/kg IV) can be given following mannitol
administration. For increased ICP in a normotensive
animal, 1-2 ml/kg of 7% hypertonic saline can be given
IV over 5-10 minutes and repeated if needed. For
increased ICP in a hypotensive animal, 4 ml/kg 7%
hypertonic saline can be given IV over 5-10 minutes.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion after considering
signalment, exclusion of similarly appearing disorders,
MRI of the brain and CSF analysis.
Management
Treatment consists of immunosuppressive therapy with
glucocorticoids (1-2 mg/kg PO q12h, then tapered over
several months). Affected dogs usually respond to
therapy in 2-3 days, but it may take up to 10 days to see
an effect. Dogs not responding to glucocorticoids may
require additional medications:

DECISION MAKING
The receptor organ (macular receptors of the saccule and
utricle located within the vestibule and crista ampullaris
ofthe semi-circular duct located within the semi-circular
canals) detects the position and movement of the head in
space while the animal is standing at rest or when it is
moving. The information on the position of the head is
converted into electrical signals, which are sent via the
vestibular nerve to the brain. The balance control centre
in the brainstem processes this information and sends
messages to the rest of the body to keep the animal
upright (facilitatory effect on the ipsilateral extensor
muscles of the limb via the vestibulospinal tract).

ment of the eyes (via medial longitudinal fasciculus and
CNs II, IV and VI) to change the position of the eyes
according to the position of the head. Finally, the brain-
stem vestibular nuclei receive some influence from
higher vestibular centres in the thalamus and from
vestibular centres in the cerebellum (flocculonodular
 lobe and fastigial nuclei). The latter have an inhibitory
effect, mainly on the brainstem vestibular nuclei.
Through these pathways, the vestibular system controls
the position of the eyes, trunk and limbs based on the
position and movement of the head.
Head tilt
Head tilt is described as a rotation of the median plane of
the head along the axis of the body resulting in one ear
being held lower than the other one (193). It occurs in
vestibular disease as a result of the loss of anti-gravity
muscle tone on one side of the neck. Head tilt must be

COMMON CAUSES OF ACUTE PERIPHERAL
VESTIBULAR DISEASE
Acute idiopathic peripheral vestibular syndrome
Overview
This syndrome affects both cats and dogs. It is most
prevalent in geriatric dogs and is rarely observed before
5 years of age. It has been reported in the late summer in
young cats with access to the outdoors in the northeast-
ern US, where it has been hypothesized (with no defini-
tive proof) that this condition is caused by migration of
Cutebra spp. larvae through the nasal cavity and cribri-
form plate of the ethmoid bone to enter the cranial cavity.

 Otitis media/interna is usually associated with chronic
otitis externa/media, nasopharyngeal infection extending

absence of external ear canal inflammation.

Management
Treament consists ofsystemic antibiotics for a minimum
of 4-6 weeks. The choice of antibiotic is dictated by
results of culture/sensitivity if available; if not, amoxi-
cillin/clavulanate, cephalosporin or fluoroquinolones
are reasonable choices to consider. Potentiated sulphon-
amides should be avoided if there is associated facial
paralysis due to the development (however limited) of
keratoconjunctivitis sicca.

Diagnosis
 Diagnosis is usually made via radiographs, which reveal
irregular bone thickening (213). Rarely, a biopsy is neces-
sary for confirmation.
Management
Pain relief and anti-inflammatory medication (pred-
nisolone) can make the dog more comfortable. Appro-
priate nutrition needs to be assured. The abnormal bone
growth usually ceases by l year of age, and lesions may
then regress (partially or completely). If the TMJ is

Diagnosis
ITN is a diagnosis of exclusion and cannot be confirmed
antemortem. The only tests that are abnormal in most
dogs are EMG and CSF analysis. EMG often reveals
 positive sharp waves and/or fibrilation potentials in the
masticatory muscles unless the dog is tested too soon
after the onset of mandibular paralysis (up to 7 days after
the onset). CSF analysis is often normal or it can reveal a
mild mononuclear pleocytosis, frequently with a normal
or mildly elevated protein content.
Management
Treatment is mainly supportive, assisting the animal to
eat and drink. Corticosteroid administration appears not
to affect the clinical course ofthe disease. The use of tape
muzzles has been recommended to improve ingestion of
food, as these dogs are unable to grab food, but can

 tion are concerns associated with ineffective supportive
care. An oesophagostomy tube can be placed to support
mutrition in severely affected animals.
Application of artificial tears or eye lubricants several
times daily may be necessary in dogs or cats with evi-
dence of dry eyes to prevent severe corneal injuries and
conjunctivitis.
The mean time for recovery ranges from 2-10 weeks.
Dogs with a more protracted recovery frequently show
 marked atrophy of the masticatory muscles caused by
prolonged denervation. Dogs with dropped jaw should
be encouraged to chew (on natural/synthetic chews).
Owners can also be instructed to perform a gentle,
passive range of movements of their pet's jaw as part of a
 physiotherapy plan. The main aim of the physiotherapy

the facial paresis/paralysis may be part of a

(see Chapter 10). Facial weakness, in particular a
decrementing blink reflex, may be seen with
junctionopathies, such as MG, or, more rarely,
botulism (see Chapters 24 and 25, respectively)
and tick paralysis, especially in Australia.
 Idiopathic facial nerve dysfunction. If facial
paresis/paralysis occurs as the sole sign,
idiopathic facial paresis is the most likely
diagnosis. However, even though hypothy-

 Oropharyngeal dysphagia (impaired bolus

oesophagus).
 Oesophageal dysphagia (impaired bolus passage
from the cranial oesophagus to the gastro-
oesophageal junction).
Gastra-oesophageal dysphagia (disturbance in the
passage from the oesophagus into the stomach).
The oropharyngeal phase of swallowing can be further
subdivided into oral, pharyngeal and cricopharyngeal
stages:
 Oral dysphagia is associated with disorders of
initiation of swallowing (bolus accumulation at the
base of the tongue).
 Pharyngeal dysphagia describes a disorder in
propulsion of the bolus across the pharynx (rostral
to caudal pharyngeal contractions propel the bolus
from the base of the tongue to the cricopharyngeal
passage).
 Cricopharyngeal dysphagia describes failure of

the problem. If a neurological lesion is suspected, it is
important to identify whether it is UMN or LMN in
nature, and whether it is originating from the brain, the
spinal cord, the nerve roots or a peripheral nerve.
Initial assessment of the gait allows the clinician to
determine which limb or limbsis/are affected and to gain
an impression of the severity of the problem. It is possi-
 ble in most cases to establish from observing the gait
whether the principal problem is lameness, which often
suggests an orthopaedic problem, or weakness, which is
 more suggestive of neurological disease.
Shortened stride length is frequently associated with
decreased muscle tone or pain, which would be more
commonly associated with LMN lesions or orthopaedic
disease, respectively. In contrast, UMN lesions can be
associated with increased stride length or hypermetria.
Compared with UMN paresis, disorders of the LMN
often only result in paresis and not in ataxia. Although
most peripheral neuropathies affect both motor and
sensory axons, the gait dysfunction principally reflects
LMN paresis. The degree of paresis varies from a short

Neurological examination
The neurological examination consists of assessment of
gait, posture, mentation, CN function, posturalreactions
and segmental spinal reflexes. Cutaneous sensation of
different peripheral nerves of the dysfunctional limb
should be tested, although this is accepted to be a subjec-
 tive behavioural assessment in many dogs (see Chapter
10). The eyes should be assessed for evidence ofHorner's
syndrome, which can be caused by a lesion affecting the
caudal part of the brachial plexus (T1-T3 nerve roots)
The C8 and T1 nerve roots supplying the lateral thoracic
 nerve can also be affected in these cases, leading to ipsi-
lateral loss of the cutaneous trunci (panniculus) reflex.
Any paresis should be characterized as UMN or
LMN in origin where possible. Most neurological
lesions causing monoparesis or lameness affect spinal
 nerve roots or peripheral nerves rather than the CNS.
Therefore, any deficits tend to be LMN in nature. It
should be borne in mind that lateralized spinal cord
lesions (236) can also produce monoparesis, although in
most cases involvement of more than one limb can be
appreciated.
 For the forelimbs, the triceps and extensor carpi
radialis reflexes are helpful for assessing the radial nerve
proximally and distally, respectively. These reflexes are

(arrow).
For the hindlimbs, the femoral nerve can be assessed
using the patellar reflex or extensor tone of the quadri-
ceps. The sensory zone innervated by this nerve is the
medial aspect of the proximal limb. The cranial tibial
reflex is useful in assessing the peroneal nerve; the tibial
nerve can be tested using the gastrocnemius tendon
reflex. The withdrawal reflex is useful in assessing the
sensory function of different nerves as well as sciatic
motor function. This can be accompanied by a neuro-
 genic atrophy and an altered stance (237). Obturator
nerve dysfinction leads to a failure to maintain adduction
of the limb on slippery surfaces, although this can be dif-
ficult to appreciate, as dogs and cats can adapt their gait
surprisingly well to accommodate for obturator deficits.

Brachial plexus avulsion
Overview
Brachial plexus avulsion is the most common traumatic
 peripheral neuropathy in the dog. It results from forced
 abduction of the forelimb and subsequent stretching or
tearing of nerve roots, often following a road traffc acci-
dentor a fall. The condition may affect the cranial (C6/7)
or caudal (C8/T1) nerve roots in isolation or can involve
the entire brachial plexus. It is more commonly unilateral
than bilateral. Three types oflesion can be distinguished
 depending on the degree of nerve damage:

Monoparesis and Neurological Causes of Lameness
309
Tendon transposition procedures can be considered
 to restore elbow or carpal function. Careful case selection
is essential and any muscle to be transposed should
have its function assessed using electrophysiology
 prior to surgery. Pancarpal arthrodesis, to prevent carpal
 collapse secondary to loss of radial nerve function, is
rarely appropriate since in most cases elbow finction is
also absent. Amputation should be considered in more
severely affected cases or if complications develop. As
this is a 'salvage' procedure, it is prudent in most cases
to wait 2-3 months after the injury before such a decision
is made.
The prognosis depends on the extent of the avulsion.

 are able to bear weight and maintain sensation over the

 indicator. Early decreased conduction velocity is associ-
ated with a poor outcome.
Peripheral nerve sheath tumours
Overview
Peripheral nerve sheath tumours arise from cells sur-
rounding the axons in peripheral nerves or nerve
roots and are frequently malignant. Tumours spread
proximally towards the spinal cord (239). They usually
present with severe, progressive lameness, marked
muscle atrophy and pain. They rarely present with acute
monoparesis (240). Neurological deficits are seen late in
the clinical course, if at all. Deep palpation of the axilla
can allow identification of a mass in some cases. Electro-

either to vascular obstruction that develops within the

that originates from another vascular bed and travels to
the brain (thromboembolism). Depending on the size of

Conventional magnetic resonance imaging
Conventional MRI can be used to depict ischaemic
stroke within 12-24 hours of the onset and to distinguish
haemorrhagic lesions from infarction. T2-weighted and
FLAIR images are particularly useful for imaging
ischaemic stroke. They give a more anatomical image of
the brain and depict oedema, old infarcts, microangio-
pathic changes, tumours and other pathology. With
these sequences, ischaemic infarction appears as a
hyperintense  lesion. Differentiation  of ischaemic
core from penumbral tissue is, however, not possible.
T2*-weighted (gradient echo) images are used to show
the presence of, or exclude, intracranial haemorrhage.
Although infarcts can sometimes be diffcult to differen-
tiate from other pathological processes such as inflam-
matory diseases, they tend to have certain distinguishing
characteristics on conventional MR images (252-254).
The conformity of an infarct to a vascular territory is
an important element in the diagnosis and helps in
distinguishing these lesions from brain tumours, inflam-
mation and trauma. Ischaemia/infarcts are caused by

tissue and minimal to no mass effect.

SPECIFIC EMERGENCIES
Infarcts are caused by blood perfusion failure and,
therefore, energy depletion. The consequence for the
cell is failure of the Nat/K+ pump and accumulation of
Nat and water within the cell (i.e. cytotoxic oedema).
The MRI changes seen in ischaemic parenchyma rely
on an increase in tissue water content. Gradually, the
T2-weighted or FLAIR images (253) become more
hyperintense in the ischaemic region, paricularly over
the first 24 hours (i.e. T2 prolongation, which produces
higher signal intensity in areas of increased tissue water
content).
MRI changes are best appreciated in the grey matter
 and are well visualized in deep grey matter structures,

Functional MRI techniques have been developed for

sion and perfusion imaging and magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA). Diffusion and perfusion MRI are
 new techniques that monitor water transport in the
microenvironment at cellular or capillary level. They
 provide complementary information about the patho-
physiological processes following cerebral ischaemia.
 DWI is used commonly in humans to improve the
sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute
stroke, making it an ideal sequence for positive identifi-
cation of hyperacute stroke and excluding the clinical
mimics of stroke (254, 255). The temporal evolution of
the DWI signal also allows discrimination of acute versus
chronic lesions.

Acute infarction results in water trapping within the cells
and causes reduced diffusion. This phenomenon of
decreased diffusion and cytotoxic oedema produces a
regional hyperintensity on DWI.

differentiate between true restricted diffusion and *T2
shine through', bright lesions on DWI should always be
confirmed with ADC maps, which exclusively measure
diffusion. The ADC map helps to remove the effect of
T2-weighted hyperintensity (associated with cytotoxic
 oedema), which can contribute to DW hyperintensity.
The classic appearance of acute infarction is
hyperintensity on DWI and reduced ADC.
In addition to DWI, MR perfusion-weighted
imaging is employed to depict regions of hypoperfusion
in the brain and can document tissue âat risk' (i.e.
 penumbra) by comparing the results with the findings
on DWI.
In addition to its use for tissue evaluation, MRA can
non-invasively assess the intracranial vascular status of
stroke patients (256). Two techniques can be used: time
of flight MRA and contrast-enhanced MRA. One of the
main limitations of MRA is its lower resolution com-
 pared with conventional angiography. This limitation
becomes progressively worse as the luminal size of the
vessels decreases. In humans, angiographic techniques
are especially used for screening of carotid artery
stenosis, vascular malformations (e.g. arteriovenous
malformation, venous angioma) and aneurysms. The
use ofMRA in dogs has been described and may allow
identification of underlying vascular lesions in cases of
canine stroke.

Neurological deficits refer to the spinal cord seg-
ments involved (C1-C5, C6-T2, T3-L3 or L4-S3) and
 are often asymmetric. Lateralization of signs is the result
of asymmetric branching of the intrinsic spinal cord
vasculature, particularly of the central branches of the
ventral spinalartery, and has been reported in 53-86% of
 dogs. The most commonly affected spinal cord segments
have been reported to be L4-S3 (43-47%) and C6-T2

Bacterial and rickettsial meningoencephalomyelitis
Bacterial meningitis and CNS abscesses are among the
most important differentials for MEM that may lead to
 an emergency presentation. Bacterial meningitis may
result from several different mechanisms including:
haematogenous spread from other foci within the body;
direct inoculation from traumatic wounds or needles
following CSF acquisition; or direct extension from
other structures of the head (eyes, ears, cribriform plate)
Bacteria that have been reported in association with
meningitis include Stapbylococcus spp., Pasteurella spp.,
Escberichia coli, Atinomyces spp.,Nocardia spp., Klebsiella
spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Eubacterium spp. and Bac-
mononuclear and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells into
 the leptomenin ges. If the underlying neuroparenchyma
is affected, necrosis of the grey and white matter may
occur due to direct neuronal injury or thrombosis.
CNS abscesses and empyema, similar to bacterial
meningitis, may result from haematogenous spread from
other foci within the body, direct inoculation or direct
extension from other structures of the head (nasal cavity

The ability to recognize signs consistent with elevated

 management of dogs and cats following head trauma.
Trauma significant enough to cause brain injury will

Assessment of limb function
The firstcategory ofthe MGCS describes motor activity,
limb tone and posture. Voluntary motor activity is char-
acterized as normal, paretic or recumbent. Patients typi-
cally maintain some degree of voluntary motor activity
 even in altered states of consciousness unless they are
comatose. Abnormal motor function usually reflects
either brainstem injury or spinal cord injury; the latter
 may complicate the assessment of head trauma.
Tone is evaluated by placing the limbs through a
passive range of motion. Increased tone can be seen fol-
lowing cranial trauma, as CNS inhibitory modulation to
the LMNs is lost. However, severe brain injuryleading to
coma will be associated with decreased tone in all limbs.
Spinal reflexes are tested primarily to assess nerve func-
 tion, but may provide some information on cerebral
 activity Animals may have exagerated refexes following
cerebral injury and absent reflexes when comatose.
An animal's posture can also provide information
 about the location and degree of brain injury following
 trauma. Decerebrate rigidity (289a) can occur following
cerebral trauma and suggests severe brain injury and a
poor prognosis, as this posture reflects loss of communi-
cation between the cerebrum and the brainstem. Animals
with decerebrate rigidity have opisthotonus with hyper-
extension of all four limbs and are stuporous or coma-
tose, with abnormal pupillary light reactions.
 Decerebellate rigidity suggests acute cerebellar damage
and may cause either flexion or extension of the hind-
limbs (289b); however, consciousness may be normal.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Animals with spinal trauma can present with a range of
signs depending on the location and severity ofthe injury.
Mild injuries may just cause spinal pain, but more severe
injuries cause neurological deficits related to the location
(see Chapter 1). The aneurological examination aims to
localize the neurological injury and to grade its severity.

ence of voluntary motor function and nociception in

A fill neurological assessment should be performed
cautiously, as clinical deterioration is possible due to ver-
tebral instability. Such a deterioration can be catastroph-
ic, particularly in patients that have suffered an
atlantoaxial injury. It should be remembered that toy
breeds can develop atlantoaxial instability secondary to
minor trauma due to congenital malformations of the
dens and associated ligaments.
Patients who have suffered trauma can have other

views are taken first and evaluated for evidence of
fractures or luxations. Orthogonal views should always
be obtained. Ideally, a horizontal beam is used to obtain
the ventrodorsal views. Ifthis is not possible, the patient
should be rolled onto its back very carefully with
adequate support. The radiographs are evaluated for
evidence of fractures, luxations, subluxations and
collapsed disc spaces. The presence of displaced frac-
ture fragments is important to note, as this indicates
compression is likely. The radiographs should be
evaluated for evidence of instability based on the three
compartment model (see above). In the case of suspect-

radiographs, the cervical spine can be flexed carefilly

PROGNOSIS
The prognosis associated with spinal cord injury is influ-
enced by the severity of the spinal cord injury and the
 presence of injuries to other organs (e.g. lungs, heart,
bladder). The form of treatment (surgical versus conser-
vative) does notappear to influence outcome, although in
published case series the more severely affected patients
h
tend to be treated surgically, and so a true comparison is
difficult. Prognostic indicators based on the neurological
examination are somewhat different for different regions
of the spine:
âThoracolumbar injuries carry a guarded to grave
 prognosis for recovery of hindlimb function and
faecal and urinary continence if the animal is
paraplegic with loss of nociception to its hindlimbs.
If nociception is still present, these animals do have
a good chance of recovery.
 Cervical injuries are associated with a guarded to
grave prognosis if the animal is tetraplegic and
unable to ventilate adequately. If treated surgically,
the risk of perioperative death can be as high as
36% in cervical injuries. Note that it is extremely
unusual to see tetraplegic animals that lack

Thymectomy
Surgical removal of hyperplastic thymic tissue is associ-

with generalized forms of AMG. The potential benefits
of thymectomy for canine MG patients is unknown;
however, complete removal of thymomas has been asso-
ciated with normalization of the AChR antibody titre
 and resolution of clinical signs. Surgical removal of a
thymoma also resulted in rapid resolution of mega-

Supportive care
Supportive care and nutritional support are critical
when treating a patient with MG. In those patients
with normal pharyngeal and oesophageal function (i.e.
without megaoesophagus), supportive care is minimal.
Oral feeding can continue normally because the risk of
 aspiration pneumonia is low. In a patient with pharyngeal
dysfunction or megaoesophagus, a nutritional plan must
be devised. If the patient is able to consume food orally

gastrostomy tube requires general anaesthesia, which
may present a significant risk in some myasthenic
patients. A low-profile' replacement gastrostomy tube
can be utilized long term for added convenience. In cases
of acute fulminating AMG, parenteral nutrition may be
the only feasible option and should be implemented as
soon as possible.
Aspiration pneumonia is a common complication
related to AMG and the main cause of death in these
 patients. Early detection and aggressive treatment are
vital for a successful outcome. Radiography, pulse
 oximetry, arterial blood gas monitoring, body tempera-
ture monitoring and careful auscultation allow early
identification of pneumonia. Patients with aspiration
 pneumonia should be treated with broad-spectrum anti-
biotics, ideally based on culture and sensitivity results
from tracheal wash specimens. In addition, respiratory
supportive care, including supplemental oxygen, nebu-
lization treatments and coupage exercises, is beneficial
(352). Certain antibiotics (i.e. aminoglycosides, ampi-
cillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and imipenem)
should be avoided because they can have potentially
adverse effects on the NM junction. In cases of acute ful-
minating AMG, ventilatory support is usually required
due to weakness of the intercostal muscles and/or

â² 353 The mechanism of action of (a) botulism and (b) tetanus neurotoxins. (1) Normal acetylcholine release
at the NM junction. (2) The botulinum toxin is haematogenously transported from the gut to the axon terminal
where it is absorbed via endocytosis. (3) T'he heavy chain of the toxin releases the light chain into the terminal
 cytoplasm, where it cleaves specific SNARE proteins (4, 5) required for fusion of acetylcholine vesicles to the
 presynaptic membrane, thus preventing their exocytosis. In contrast,the tetanus neurotoxin usually enters the
bloodstream through a wound. It, too, attaches to the presynaptic membrane (6), but is transported back through
the axon into the CNS (7). T'he toxin then binds to inhibitory interneurons and, as with botulism, the light chain
is freed. This targets the vesicle-associated membrane protein synaptobrevin, preventing the release of the
inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine (8) and leading to uncontrolled release of acetylcholine (9).
The toxin is spread haematogenously (or, in some

to date have been caused by type C toxin, with the excep-
 tion of two cases reported from Senegal caused by type D
toxin. Naturally occurring botulism has only been
reported once to date in cats, where a group of cats were
fed pelican carrion; however, the disease has been exper-
 imentally produced in cats. Botulism is reported in man
and a variety of other animals, with different antigenic
strains responsible for disease in different species. Differ-
ent strain types produce identicalclinical signs, but strain
type is important as strain-specific antiserum is required
for treatment. Botulism in man has been reported sec-
ondary to types A, B, E and F. Type C is also the most
common strain in other animals, although strain D is
sometimes also seen in cattle, strain B is reported in
horses and strains A and E occur in birds and mink.
C. botulinum is found worldwide and is a relatively
ubiquitous bacterium, present in the soil, marine and
freshwater sediments and the gastrointestinal tracts of
mammals and fish. C. botulinum is capable of producing
spores and these are resistant to heat, light, desiccation,
many chemical agents and radiation. Under anaerobic
conditions, combined with a high organic nutrient envi-
ronment, the bacterium produces botulinum toxin as it
grows. Vegetative cels contain higherlevelsoftoxin than

administration of a lower dose (as low as 1% of the

tetanus. The intrathecal administration of antitoxin
means that it does not need to cross the blood-brain
barrier and there is a suggestion that it may parially
neutralize CNS-bound toxin. However, intrathecal
administration is no longer recommended in human
 practice because a number of studies and meta-analyses

animals have shown that intratumoural neovascula-
ture can be morphologically and functionally
abnormal, e.g. lacking endothelium, having large
endothelial fenestrations, or overexpressing
receptors for pro-angiogenic proteins and vascular
permeability factors such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF). VEGF and its receptors are
overexpressed in canine intracranial neoplasms,
suich as meningiomas, astrocytomas and oligoden-
drogliomas. These pathological alterations in
vascular permeability factors may contribute to the
oedema-forming potential of certain tumour types.
Rostrotentorial meningiomas and high-grade
gliomas are often associated with significant vaso-
 genic oedema, which willoften accumulate along
subcortical white matter tracts (360, 361, 363)

SPECIFIC EMERGENCIES
Cytotoxic oedema occurs when there is failure of
the Nat/K+ ATPase pumps to extrude intracellular
sodium, leading to an intracellular accumulation of
water. It is usually due to cellular energy substrate
 deficiency from ischaemia/hypoxia, hypoglycaemia
or excitotoxicity, or from toxins that interfere with
cellular metabolism, such as reactive oxygen species
 and nitric oxide. Progressive distension of the cell
eventually leads to cellular lysis and death. Grey
matter is preferentially affected, as this tissue is
more metabolically active and quantitatively
 contains more Na+/K+ ATPase pumps per unit area
than white matter.

INTRACRANIAL NEOPLASIA AND SECONDARY PATHOLOGICAL EFFECTS
465
Neoplastic erosion into, or compression of, brain vascu-
lature can result in intracranial haemorrhage, intravascu-
lar neoplastic embolization or ischaemic brain infarction.
High-grade gliomas and choroid plexus carcinoma,
whose phenotypes are often defined by significant neo-
vascular proliferation, may haemorrhage spontaneously
in intratumoural, intraventricular, subarachnoid, epidur-
 al or intraparenchymal locations. Haemorrhage can
result in acute neurological deterioration if it is severe
enough to cause a mass effect or obstructive hydro-
cephalus from resultant haematoma formation (365).
Ischaemic infarctions will result in the evolution of cyto-
toxic and vasogenic brain oedema, which will further
exacerbate intracranial hypertension; however, this is
dependent on whether the infarct is lacunar or territorial
 in nature (see Chapter 17).
Brain herniations are the terminal effects of intracra-
nial hypertension. Three types of spontaneous brain

The surgical approach employed in individual cases is

 minimal basophilic cytoplasm, and a single atypical mitotic
figure, consistent with a large cell lymphoma.
Idiopathic hypercalcaemia and neoplasia are the most
common differentials in cats followed by renal failure
(elevation of total calcium but usually not ionized
calcium).
Diagnosis
The investigation of suspected PHPTH must focus on
differentiating it from other causes of hypercalcaemia.
Investigations include assays of total and ionized calcium,
lymph node cytology (384), CBC, serum biochemistry,
urinalysis, spinal (385) and abdominal imaging, splenic
cytology (385), ACTH stimulation testing and assays of
PTH  and parathyroid hormone-related protein
(PTHrP). Patients with PHPTH typically have total and
ionized hypercalcaemia and inappropriately normal or
increased PTH with normal PTHrP concentrations.
Patients with only PHPTH will demonstrate an increase
in serum cortisol concentrations following ACTH
stimulation.
Management
Aggressive therapy will be required in patients with very
high calcium levels. High Ca:Phos ratio (>5.6 SI units
[>70 US units]) are un likely in PHPTH, but are possible
with other causes of hypercalcaemia. Treatment for
 PHPTH typically involves surgical resection of the

Clinical signs of cortical neuronal damage range from
hyperexcitability to tremors, blindness, cognitive dys-

 tremors and weakness typically appear when plasma
glucose levels approach 3.6-3.8 mmol/l (64.8-68.4
mg/dl). When plasma glucose levels fall below 1 mmol/l
(18 mg/dl), seizures, severe brain damage, coma
and death may occur. However, as with many homeosta-

following and are often performed simultaneously:
systemic stabilization; symptomatic treatment; deconta-

providing antidotes if available.
Systemic stabilization
The patient's airway should be protected using a cuffed
endotracheal tube if the patient is obtunded and/or at
risk of aspiration of gastric contents. Suction of the oro-

Snake bite envenomation
Overview
This section concentrates on Australian elapid enveno-
mations; however, North American coral snake enveno-
mation is also discussed.
In Australia, identification of specific snake species by
members of the public is frequently inaccurate. Accurate
choice ofantivenom is determined by knowledge oflocal
snakes, snake identification using a scale key or the most
 appropriate choice of antivenom determined by use of
the Australian CSL Snake Venom Detection Kit. There
 are at least 25 terrestrial species of snake within Australia
whose bite may require treatment with antivenom. The
most significant genera responsible for envenomation
include tiger snakes (Notecbis) (40ob), brown snakes
(Pseudonaja), black snakes (Pseudechis) (400c), copper-
heads (4ustrelaps), death adders (Acantbophis) (400d) and
taipans (Oxyuranus).

Focal neurological deficits, such as localized facial paral-
ysis, can occur with ticks found ipsilaterally on the head
or neck. Other neurological signs include changes in the
sound of vocalization (bark or meow), pupillary dilation
and loss ofPLR, palpebral paralysis, decreased gag reflex,
facial paralysis, bladder paralysis, gagging and retching.
Salivation and retching are common due to pharyngeal
and oesophageal dysfunction. Megaoesophagus is a
common finding on thoracic radiographs (70% of cases).
Vomiting also occurs. Hypoventilation secondary to res-
piratory paralysis occurs late in the disease. During the
final stages, hypoxaemia and hypercapnoea develop.
Hypoxaemia is not solely due to hypoventilation and can
be contributed to by either aspiration pneumonia or pul-
b
monary oedema. Respiratory compromise is significant-
ly associated with mortality. Laryngeal paralysis may
cause clinically significant upper airway obstruction.
Reported cardiovascular abnormalities include pro-
longed QT intervals and altered T wave morphology on
ECG analysis. These changes temporarily persist after
apparent recovery. Rarely, increased systemic mean and
systolic arterial pressure is observed and in-vivo studies
have shown increases in pulmonary artery pressure.
Diagnosis
The presence ofan Ixodes bolocyclus tick and appropriate
clinical signs confirm the diagnosis. Even if no evidence

INTRODUCTION
This chapter discuses theconsiderations and techniques
for anaesthetizing animals with neurological disease.
The chapter willcover intracranial disease, spinal disease
and NM disease. A thorough understanding of the
pathophysiology ofdiseases affecting these regions of the
nervous system is essentialto select the most appropriate
anaesthetic technique and drug combination.

intracranial disease are detailed in Table 100 (p. 539).
Drugs such as acepromazine and medetomidine are best
avoided in animals with intracranial disease.
Opioids provide analgesia and varying degrees of
sedation without affecting cerebral perfusion or ICP.
Adverse effects associated with a decrease in heart rate
 and respiratory depression can be avoided by using con-
 servative doses. Morphine administration is best avoided
in patients with high ICP given its significant potential
for causing vomiting (and transient increases in ICP).
Benzodiazepines may be useful as anxiolytics in criti
cally ill animals. These agents should be used cautiously
in animals with mild disease/minimal decreases in men-
tation, as the effects can be unreliable and excitement,
dysphoria and disinhibition can occur.

Avoid sudden/marked increases in blood pressure
Various stimuli during anaesthesia, including nocicep-
tion from surgical stimulation, can cause increases in BP,
which in a diseased brain may result in an increase in
 CBF and ICP. To minimize sudden or marked increases
in BP during anaesthesia, the continuous infusion of an
opioid (as described above) can help minimize this sym-
pathetic stimulation and the haemodynamic responses to
 surgery. This in turn will contribute to the maintenance

Ensure adequate ventilation
Reduce rates of opioid infusions
If high infusion rates of opioids have been used during
surgery, it is important that the infusion rate is reduced in
preparation for recovery. Once the patient is extubated
and IPPV can no longer be delivered, it is imperative that
the patient can breathe spontaneously. Extubation
should therefore only be performed when the patientcan
spontaneously ventilate adequately (check the capno-
 graph or blood gases).
When using either an alfentanil or fentanyl infusion,
the rate should be reduced approximately 30 minutes
prior to extubation. This will depend to some extent on
the duration of infusion and the total amountof drug that
has been delivered (the higher the dose and the longer
the infusion, the more time required to reduce serum
concentrations).
Remifentanil does notaccumulate and activityrapidly
disappears after infusion is stopped, allowing prompt
return to spontaneous ventilation. The disadvantage is
that the analgesic activity is also rapidly terminated. If

agents. Endotracheal intubation should be performed
carefully with adequate support of the head and neck,

Maintenance of anaesthesia

Maintenance of anaesthesia is usually performed with
inhalation agents. As autoregulation of perfusion to the
spinal cord and chemoreceptor response to carbon

furane than halothane, these are the preferred inhalation
 agents. Nitrous oxide is reported to increase ICP as a
result of cerebral vasodilation, so is best avoided in

presence of an ETT, the animal should immediately be
 positioned with its head over the edge of the table to
allow gravity-assisted drainage of the pharynx. The
pharynx and oesophagus should be suctioned before
intubation is performed.
Induction of anaesthesia should be performed with
short-acting intravenous agents that facilitate rapid
 control of the airway. Furthermore, a prompt recovery
from anaesthesia is important in order for the patient to
regain control of its airway as soon as possible. Agents
such as propofol and alfaxolone allow rapid recovery;
however, in animals at risk of obstruction, titration of
these agents to effect can delay intubation. Furthermore,
bolus administration can lead to marked decreases
in BP. To reduce the dose and thus the side-effects,
co-induction agents (fentanyl + short-acting benzo-
diazepines) can be administered immediately prior to an
intravenous induction agent. This combination ofagents
willinvariably cause apnoea and therefore animals should
be ventilated as soon as intubation is performed.

SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT ISSUES
SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR
DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
Myelography
Myelography is associated with a risk of seizures on
recovery from anaesthesia and a variety of cardiopul-
monary abnormalities that can occur during anaesthesia,
 particularly during/afer contrast injection (418).
Seizure activity
Seizure activity is a recognized adverse effect of injection
of contrast agents into the subarachnoid space. The risk
 of seizures is influenced by several factors including the
volume and rate of contrast injection, the site of injec-

ography compared with lumbar myelography. Animals
weighing >20 kg are also observed to have a higher inci-
dence of seizures, posibly due to the relatively higher
volume of contrast injected.
To reduce the risk of seizures, the dose rate should be
calculated from surface area rather than body weight, the
speed of injection should be slow and the head should
be elevated as soon as injection is complete to promote
the flow of contrast away from the head. The use of a

INTRODUCTION
Pain is defined by the International Association for the
Study of Pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional
experience associated with actual or potential tissue
damage or expressed in terms of such damage. Recogni-
tion ofthe presence of pain and assessmentof the severity
of pain are essential for optimal management and are
integral steps towards appropriate treatment of pain in
animals with (and without) neurological disease. Poorly
managed pain is a significant contributor to morbidity
and mortality, has adverse welfare implications and
delays the return to normal function. Good pain
management relies on regular pain assessment and
includes the administration of analgesic drugs (419).
The aims of pain treatment are to:
b
 Inhibit the neuroendocrine stress response, which
may compromise recovery.
*Maintain tissue perfusion.
â Allow restful sleep.
âEncourage mobility.
* Improve appetite.
âAttenuate peripheral and central sensitization.
A plethora of drugs exist that can be used alone or in
combination to manage pain in animals with neurologi-
cal disease. Analgesic therapy must be tailored to each
individual animal based on the cause, duration and

volume by drawing fluid from the interstitial and intra-
cellular spaces. This fluid deficit needs to be included in
calculations of fluid rates and volumes required for
replacement fluid therapy (see below). In animals with
chronic dehydration, abnormalities in serum sodium and
osmolarity may already exist. In these cases, administra-
tion of hypertonic saline is contraindicated.
 428 In animals prone to pulmonary oedema, as shown
 in this radiograph of a dog following pulmonary
contusions, the use of hypertonic saline or synthetic
colloids may be beneficial.

Weight loss during the replacement/maintenance

have been shown to have significant negative nitrogen

week (see Further reading), therefore weight loss due to
inadequate nutrition should be taken into account when
interpreting decreases in body weight. Weight loss due to

PRINCIPLES OF BLOOD TRANSFUSION THERAPY
Administration of blood products is required in an imals
that have suffered significant loss of blood or red cells in
 order to maintain oxygen-carrying capacity and thus
 oxygen delivery to vital organs such as the brain. In
animals with brain injury this is particularly important
for preventing secondary neuronal damage due to
ischaemia. Administration of blood products is also
required in animals thathave disorders of primary or sec-
ondary haemostasis. Indications for different blood

Selection of donors
All donors should be healthy, fully vaccinated, free of
blood-borne diseases/parasites and have never previous
ly received a transfision. Each animal should receive an
annual physical examination, CBC, biochemistry and
urinalysis. PCV and TS should be checked prior to every
transfusion.

Canine donors

to once every 3 weeks. Greyhounds are considered ideal.
The main dog erythrocyte antigens (DEAs) include
DEA types 1.1, 1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Dogs frequently
have more than one type of antigen on their red cells and
so can be positive for several blood types. Testing is not
available for all blood types. DEA 1.1 is the most anti-
 genic blood type and is associated with acute haemolytic
reactions in previously sensitized individuals. Because

Use of these formulae requires measurement of PCV
prior to infusion. In animals that have suffered acute
haemorrhage, the PCV changes very little initially and
can take several hours to reach the minimum value,
depending on the amount of fluid administered. There-
fore, the amount of blood/packed RBCs required must
be estimated from the severity of clinical signs. With loss
of <15-20% of circulating blood volume, sympathetic
stimulation and associated responses resulting in
increases in heart rate, peripheral vasoconstriction and
venoconstriction are usually able to maintain BP and
 peripheral perfusion. As blood loss exceeds 20%, com-
pensatory mechanisms will be gradually overwhelmed
and reduction in BP and tissue perfusion will occur.

593
Should a long or uncertain recovery of voluntary uri
nation be expected, based on the patient's neurological
status (i.e. absence of nociception in the hindlimbs
and/or tail and/or perineum), surgical placement ofa cys-
totomy catheter can provide long-term management of
urinary retention/incontinence without interfering with
the potential recovery of voluntary urination. Several
types of cystotomy catheter can be used. These include
percutaneous catheters or Foley urinary catheters, which
are placed after laparotomy or a minimally invasive
inguinal incision.
If possible, patients should still be taken outside. The
change ofsurroundings is beneficial to their mental well-
being and may also promote voluntary urination. It is
usefil to find out from the owners how frequently the
patient would normally urinate, any toileting commands

Management of urine scalding
Urine scalding arises from prolonged contact of urine
with the skin (441). The onset appears as small erythe-
matous areas, but these can develop into much larger
areas. Urine scalding is a lot easier to treat if noticed early
in its course. Patients at risk should be monitored daily.

ably, Foley silicone catheters should be placed and left im
situ provided no complications occur; they should be
maintained in an aseptic manner (440). Nevertheless, the
risk ofurinary tract infection will increase with increased
durations of catheterization, therefore the urinary
catheter should be removed as soon as voluntary urina-
tion is suspected (e.g. recovery ofvoluntary movement in
the hindlimbs).
Urine should be monitored daily for output (1-2 ml
kg/hour), SG and sediment cytology as well as changes
 in colour and odour. Prophylactic antibiosis for urinary
 tract infection is not recommended when an indwelling
urinary catheter is placed, as it significantly increases the
chance of drug-resistant bacterial disease.

Therapeutic exercises
Assisted range of motion
Assisted range of motion (AROM) exercises are per-
formed on patients that have no voluntary motor func-

muscle strength to move the limbs. The therapist has to
move the limbs in order to perform the exercise. AROM
exercises can be performed in either lateral recumbency
or assisted standing. Moving a limb through its normal
ROM, as though walking, is an AROM exercise.
These exercises can be performed after the PROM

in unison. They can be performed 5-10 times on each
limb, repeated 3-4 times daily and have similar ffects as
