Preface

How can color photographs demonstrate
science of anesthesia. There are many different
anesthesia? This is a tricky but practical question
ways to draw or paint a flower, just as there are
and the answers will hopefully be found in the
 many different and appropriate ways to perform
following pages. I have spent my teaching career
 anesthesia. This book is an expression of my own
searching for a handbook like this. When
personal experiences, as well as those of my
describing anesthetic machine parts, breathing
 colleagues. Readers are advised to approach the
circuits, dose charts, and anesthetic techniques I

accidental adjustment of the flowmeters. (4) Pediatric flowmeters are graduated in milliliters from
zero to I,oo0 ml (tube on the left in the picture), while adult flowmeters (tube on the right in the
picture) are graduated in liters.
 5, 6 Oxygen enters the rotameter and passes through a bobbin (float), exiting at the top of the
flowmeter to enter the machine and vaporizer. Ball-shaped bobbins are read at the center or widest
diameter of the bobbin (5).Other shapes of bobbins are read at the top of the bobbin (6).Note that
the flowmeter is tapered in shape.The clearance between the bobbin and the wall of the flowmeter
increases from bottom(narrow)to top(wide).

● Flowmeters are agent specific and color
coded. For example, in the USA, flowmeters
for oxygen are coded green, while flow-
meters for nitrous oxide are coded blue and
medical room air flowmeters are coded
 yellow. This may not be the same in other
 parts of the world.
REGULATORS (PRESSURE REDUCING
VALVES)
Key points about regulators:
●The pressure regulator, also called a pressure
reducing valve, is designed to reduce the high
 pressure from the medical gas, which is
supplied from a portable or storage tank (up
to 2,200 psi or 15,168.4 kpa in an size E
portable oxygen tank, 7), to a working

the patient's airway.
The regulator provides a constant flow of gas
irrespective of measured changes at the
source.

is the oxygen flushing valve.
+ Because anesthetic gas (isoflurane or
 sevoflurane) can vaporize to dangerously
high concentrations (isoflurane to 32% and
sevoflurane to 22% at sea level in room
 temperature), a precision vaporizer is
 required to control precisely the volume

patient.
based on their location in relation to the
breathing circuit. A vaporizer placed within
the anesthetic breathing circuit (9) is called a
vaporizer-in-the-circuit (VIC), while a
vaporizer (l) placed outside the breathing
circuit is called a vaporizer-out-of-the-circuit
(VOC).
Components ofthe anesthetic machine 17
Vaporizers-in-the-circuit

Specific points related to VICs:
VICs are non-precision vaporizers of simple
construction designed to minimize resis-
tance to breathing. The VIC is less
commonly used in current anesthesia
practice. However, some practices still have a
VIC system. The advantage of the VIC is
that it can be used with many different types
of anesthetic inhalants, given that it is not 
calibrated for a specific anesthetic gas (hence
the term non-precision vaporizer). The most
common VICs are the Ohio number 8
bottle vaporizer (10) and Stephens 
Universal vaporizer (9); both can be used
for halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane.
+As VICs are not calibrated for a specific
 anesthetic agent, the calibrators on the
vaporizer dial do not indicate the percentage
 of inhalant delivered to the patient, but
rather indicate that the vaporizer is closed,
approximately half-way closed, or fully open.
The anesthetic is vaporized while the patient
breathes through the vaporizer. As a result, a

Vaporizer-out-of-the-circuit
Specific points related to VOCs:
 VOCs are precision vaporizers. They are
 specifically designed for a particular inhalant
anesthetic agent, as the vapor pressure 
differs between agents. These vaporizers are
usually complex in design and have a
relatively high resistance to breathing. Each
precision vaponizer is identified by color and
clearly labeled to indicate the associated
anesthetic agent (1l, 12).
● Most modern vaporizers are designed
specifically for isoflurane, sevoflurane, or 
desflurane and are calibrated precision
 specific vaporizers are flow rate and
temperature compensations. That is, they
have a stabilized anesthetic concentration
 output over a wide range of environment

to 15 liters per minute).
●Due to the complex internal structure
of precision vaporizers, they are high
resistance vaporizers and cannot be
 placed within the breathing circuit.

vaporizers for use within inhalant anesthetic

An anesthetic breathing circuit (or system) is a
conduction system that allows fresh gas and the
inhalant anesthetic agent to be delivered from the
anesthetic machine to the patient while
eliminating expired CO2 and other trace gases

system (see l and 2 forthe location ofthe breath-
ing circuits). Anesthetic breathing circuits can be
largely divided into rebreathing or non-

circuit are described below.
●A rebreathing circuit enables part of the
expired alveolar gas, which contains CO2,
unused oxygen, and anesthetic gases, to
be circled back and inspired as part of the
 next fresh gas input; however, the CO2
is removed by the CO, absorbent via
chemical reactions and is not rebreathed

●A rebreathing circuit is composed of two
One-way valves (one on the inspiratory limb
and one on the expiratory limb) (30), a
reservoir bag, a fresh gas inlet, a canister for
holding a CO2 absorbent, and a pop-off
valve (sometimes called an overflow valve or
an airway pressure limiting valve). Because
of these structures, breathing resistance is
higher with a rebreathing circuit than with a
non-rebreathing circuit (3l). Since some of
the exhaled alveolar gases are reused in the
rebreathing circuit, and the elimination of
CO2 is accomplished by CO2 absorbents, a

Patients smallerthan 7-7.5 kg (15.416.5 1b) are

Patients heavier than 7-7.5 kg should be main-

reasons.
A non-rebreathing circuit minimizes the work
of breathing for smaller dogs and cats because the
circuit is designed to produce minimal resistance
to breathing. In contrast, a rebreathing circuit

 addition, most anesthetic agents, especially iso-
flurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane, induce
muscle relaxation, which further reduces the
ability ofthe respiratory muscles to overcome the
resistance of a rebreathing circuit and breathe
properly.
 The advantages of a rebreathing circuit
 are reduced oxygen flow rate, which reduces the
 cost of inhalant anesthetic agent, and the
 preservation of heat and moisture from the
patient.

 range from 3-8 ml/kg/minute.
When body temperature decreases
(a common side-effect of general
anesthesia), oxygen consumption decreases
proportionally. As a result, the oxygen flow
rate required to meet the oxygen
consumption needs of the anesthetized
 patient is actually reduced. For example,
a 50 kg dog requires an oxygen flow rate of
150-450 ml/minute to meet oxygen

endotracheal tubes.
TYPES OF ENDOTRACHEAL TUBES
There are three types of endotracheal tube:
Murphy (59), Magill (60)and Cole's:

ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE CONSTRUCTION
Endotracheal tubes are constructed of different
types of materials including polyvinyl chloride
(PVC), silicone, or red rubber.
● PVC endotracheal tubes are more rigid than
either silicone or red rubber tubes and are
therefore easier for intubation. Once the

Laryngoscopes
66
● Laryngoscopes, which generally consist of a
blade and a handle (65), are used to assist
endotracheal intubation. They are especially
useful in brachycephalic dogs (66, 67) or
cats, or in upper airway obstruction cases 
where the glottis cannot be seen clearly.
+The blade, which can be straight or curved,
has a light source and a flinch (68). The
ight source is powered by a battery, which is 
usually housed in the handle. The blade
either has a light bulb screwed onto the
blade or there is a bulb in the handle and
lght is transmitted via a fiberoptic to the tip
of the blade (67). The light source is used to
67
visualize the laryngeal opening.
 The laryngeal blade manipulates the oral soft
tissues, including the tongue, soft palate,
and epiglottis, to facilitate intubation.
[us u asn ioy aeudoidde sape ieauie]
animals range in size from O (small) to 5
(large). The two most common patterns of
laryngeal blades are the Miller (straight
blade) and the MacIntosh (curved blade)
(68), and there are many modifications
based on these two patterns.
66,67 Laryngoscopes are a particularly useful
aide for visualization of the laryngeal opening in
a brachycephalic dog with a great deal of

70 When performing chamber induction,the

there is only one inlet for inhalant anesthetic gas

Or gas to exit,which facilitates induction.This is
different to the chamber in 71, which is
connected to both.
71 An induction chamber connected to a

FACE MASKS
●Face masks are used for induction of
anesthesia or for providing oxygen to the

 occurs so that appropriate action can be 
taken.

Flowmeters should be periodically checked with
a portable oxygen flowmeter (74) to verify that
the flow is accurate downstream from the
flowmeter (75). The portable oxygen flowmeter
is a useful tool to diagnose a crack in the
flowmeter of the anesthetic machine or a leak
downstream from the flowmeter. In these cases
the anesthetic machine flowmeter shows a
dfferent flow rate to the portable oxygen
flowmeter (76).
75 This portable oxygen flowmeter is
connected to a hose from the fresh gas outlet.
When the oxygen flowmeter on the anesthetic

Various factors should be considered when
formulating a preanesthetic medication protocol: 
+The animal's health and its responses to
procedures:
Animal's species, breed, sex, age, health
status (cardiorespiratory, hepatic, renal,
 and other systemic functions), and
weight.
 Existing blood work and hydration status.
 Animal's temperament and demeanor.
● Medical history and concurrent use of

 Degree of painful stimulation.
●Duration of the procedure and time of

What is required and expected from the
drugs used:
 Degree and duration of sedation.
 Degree and duration of analgesia.
 Reduction in salivation and airway
secretions.
+Anesthetic and analgesic side-effects (on
the cardiorespiratory as well as other
body systems).

animal's health status (Table 7). This status,
together with the temperament of the patient, is
taken into account when formulating a protocol
for using a tranquilizer/sedative alone or
combined with an opioid.
● ASA I animals are considered to be overall
normal and healthy.
●ASA II animals have mild to moderate

●ASA IV animals have severe systemic disease
that limits activity and is a constant threat to

●ASA V animals are moribund and are not
 expected to survive more than 24 hours
with or without intervention. These animals
are almost always hospitalized or terminally

DISSOCIATIVES
●When used alone at high doses, ketamine
 induces poor muscle relaxation and is
associated with rough recoveries. It can also
induce seizures.
●Rough recoveries are characterized by
 paddling, repeated attempts to regain sternal 
recumbency, head-shaking, salivation,
vocalization, sudden excitement, and
movement.
+To eliminate these side-effects, ketamine
is frequently used in combination with either
diazepam, midazolam, xylazine, romifidine,
medetomidine, dexmedetomidine, or other
injectable anesthetics.
+The low pH of the solution causes pain on
IM injection.
● Ketamine induces profuse salivation and
 airway secretions that are preventable with
 atropine or glycopyrrolate.
●Dissociatives frequently increase heart rate
and concurrent use of atropine or
glycopyrrolate does not lead to further
increases in heart rate.
 Dose-dependent depression of the central
nervous system (CNS) by dissociatives is
characterized by analgesia and a light plane
 of anesthesia. The dog or cat may appear to
be awake and conscious (thus, the term
‘dissociative’ meaning dissociated from the
environment) even though they are sedated.
+
Although the animal is dissociated from the
environment, pharyngeal, laryngeal, corneal,
 and pedal reflexes persist and the eyes
remain open.

SHORT-TERM CHEMICAL RESTRAINT
115
●A 0.5-1.0 mg/kg intermittent bolus
injection at 2-4 minute intervals provides
short-term chemical restraint in dogs and
cats and this can be extended as necessary.
This technique is frequently used when
 performing bronchoscopy or a tracheal
wash, where inhalant anesthesia may not be
appropriate. The use of propofol allows the
animal to be anesthetized for brief
procedures without endotracheal intubation
while providing a plane of anesthesia
adequate for upper or lower airway
diagnostic procedures.
+Short-term chemical restraint can be used
for ECG, radiography, or other mildly
invasive diagnostic procedures (e.g. joint
tap, bone marrow aspiration) where an
analgesic drug is concurrently provided. For
example, premedicating with an opioid

via insuflation.
●As with thiopentone, propofol has minimal
effects on laryngeal function and is often
used for laryngeal function examinations in
dogs (1l5) and cats. Several studies have
shown that thiopentone is a better choice for
assessing arytenoid motion in dogs than
propofol, diazepam/ketamine or
premedication with acepromazine.
However, propofol and thiopentone are
both more effective in exposing the larynx

OTHER FACTORS TO CONSIDER
● Propofol can be safely used in sighthounds
because the recovery time is much shorter
 and smoother compared with thiopentone
used alone.
+Propofol, when combined with
 acepromazine, produces minimal changes in
 spleen size during anesthesia in dogs.
+
When using propofol for induction in cats
and small dogs, it is preferable to use a
5 mg/ml solution instead of the current
commercially available 10 mg/ml
formulation. A 5 mg/ml propofol solution
116
can be prepared by adding an equal volume
of either a balanced electrolyte solution (e.g.
 LRS) or physiological saline to the same
volume of 10 mg/ml propofol. When 
 propofol is administered in this way, a larger
volume ofinjection is used (due to added
fuids), which slows the speed of drug
 administration and minimizes the potential
 for apnea and cyanosis in smaller animals.
100
● Cats typically take 15-20 minutes longer
than dogs to recover from a comparable
single induction or CRI dose of propofol.
The cardiopulmonary effects of propofol
 and thiopentone are very similar, with both
drugs inducing vasodilation and
hypotension. Both drugs are equally capable
of causing respiratory depression and apnea.

While propofol induces unconsciousness and
 muscle relaxation and is used to treat
seizures, occasionally it can induce a

OTHER FACTORS TO CONSIDER
●While diazepam/ketamine use is a popular
combination, it presents several potential
challenges.
Ketamine induces tachycardia (transient
tachycardia of up to 220 bpm may be seen)
shortly after induction.
Ketamine is associated with rough recoveries
in dogs receiving a short (<30 minutes)
period of inhalant anesthetic maintenance.
These rough recoveries are characterized by
head shaking, salivation, and occasional
vocalization and are caused by the slow
metabolism of ketamine in dogs. Cats
tolerate ketamine better than dogs, so this is
not a clinical problem in cats.
+
Ketamine is primarily metabolized through
the liver before being excreted by the
kidneys. This is a slow process. Dogs
metabolize diazepam quickly with the result
that dogs removed from inhalant anesthetic
maintenance within 30 minutes of a
diazepam/ketamine induction will have
metabolized the diazepam. The muscle
relaxation associated with the inhalant is lost

leads onto the limbs (left fore, right fore,

surgical procedure is to be performed on
the hindquarters of the patient (e.g.
castration or ovariohysterectomy), the left
hindlimb lead creates an artifact due to
surgery-induced motion. In this situation,
a base-apex lead can be used instead.
●The base-apex lead is used by placing the
night arm and left limb leads onto the
right jugular furrow; the left arm lead is
placed on the left thorax, caudal to the
heart (131). It is important to have the
left arm lead placed caudal to the heart in
order to obtain adequate electrical signals.
When reading the base-apex lead, lead I
or lead III should be selected to obtain a
proper reading. In dogs and cats, the
QRS complex is usually in positive
deflection when lead I is selected (132)
and in negative deflection when lead III is
selected. By using a base-apex lead, the
hindquarters of the animal are completely
free from ECG leads, minimizing artifact
from surgery in this area.

● Bellows that push down to deliver a
breath to the patient and ascend during
expiration are classified as ascending
bellows (57). Newer ventilators tend to
have ascending bellows.
 Bellows that extend up to deliver a
breath to the patient and descend dur-
ing expiration are classified as descend-
ing bellows (56). The bellow rising is
powered by compressed gas or
electricity. Bellow descent is caused by a
weight attached to the bottom of the
bellow.
●Ascending bellow ventilators provide several
advantages over descending bellow
ventilators. They do not draw air from the
patient's airway during expiration because
the bellow is lightweight and is gradually
inflated during expiration.

+It is a pneumatic ventilator with a partial
anesthetic machine design. It is derived from
the basic anesthetic machine design with
‘FROGS' components.
+It does not have a flowmeter, a reservoir
bag, ventilator bellows, or a bellow housing.
● It acts like a non-rebreathing anesthetic
delivery system and, as such, it does not
have a CO2 absorbent canister or one-way
valves.
●It does require a precision vaporizer (210),
a breathing hose, an oxygen supply of 50
 psi, or a scavenging system to function as an
anesthetic delivery system.
● It has a microprocessor that controls the

low-current nerve stimulator to locate the
nerves of the brachial plexus. (24 1) The dog
is placed in lateral recumbency with area
aseptically prepared.The positive lead (red
color) is attached to the skin and the negative
lead is connected to the needle.The catheter is
filled with local anesthetic. The needle shows the

direction of needle insertion. (242) Once the
needle is in place,the current of the nerve
stimulatoris turned up and the needle is
inserted further to search for the brachial
plexus nerves. On approaching the nerves, the
muscle twitches become obvious and at this
time the current is reduced (down to 0.4 volts
ohO
or less).If the muscle twitching remains, the local
anesthetic (either lidocaine or bupivacaine) is
injected. On injection,the muscle twitches stop
and the nerve is considered blocked.
Brachialplexusblocks257
The spinal needle is placed parallel to the
243
spinal column and enters the space between
the medial aspect of the scapula and the first
rib at a level slightly above the greater
tubercle of the humerus. The needle is then
directed caudally (for approximately
1.25-1.9 cm [0.5-0.75 in]) to the level of
the second or third rib.
●The needle is aspirated to ensure that there
is no blood or air and the local anesthetic is
slowly injected as the needle is withdrawn.
 This procedure is repeated so as to create a
fan-shaped area covering the brachial plexus
nerves.
●  If a low-current nerve stimulator is used to
locate the nerves, an insulated needle is used
for the brachial plexus nerve block instead of
a spinal needle.
●An insulated needle will not penetrate the
 skin, therefore a small incision must be made
to facilitate insertion of the needle. The

the needle tip is close to the nerve. Local
anesthetic is then injected through the
needle catheter onto the branches of the
brachial plexus nerves. This method allows
the local anesthetic to be deposited in close
proximity to the nerves. As the local
 anesthetic reaches the nerve and takes effect,
the twitching stops despite the electrical
current.
+ If an animal is recovered from general
anesthesia shortly after the completion of a
successful block, shoulder paresis will be
evident (243). The sensory and motor
nerves recover gradually over time, with the
animal regaining fill use of the limb.

surgery. In addition, some patients require
continued pain medication at home.
Therefore, managing acute pain cases can
 to, and including, take-home pain
medication.
● In contrast to acute pain, chronic pain is
 pain that persists beyond 6 months and
chronic pain management requires not only
alleviating the pain, but also improving
function. Therefore, management of chronic
pain is different to acute pain. Details of
managing chronic pain, including
osteoarthritic pain, are discussed in Chapter
 13 and managing cancerous pain, a form of
chronic pain, is discussed in Chapter 14.
● It is important to treat acute pain (adaptive
pain) aggressively with multimodal
analgesia. If acute pain is not treated
appropriately, a condition called chronic
acute pain (maladaptive pain) may result.
Chronic acute pain describes acute pain that
 persists beyond the regular time frame and
becomes chronic pain. Chronic acute pain is
likely due to both peripheral and central
sensitization (a ^wind-up’ response) from
the initial injury, which results in increased
sensation over time.
The term adaptive pain is defined as pain
that triggers the initiation of responses and
behaviors that contribute to animal survival
and promote wound healing or prevent
further injury.
Maladaptive pain is defined as pain that is
 persistent or recurrent after healing and it
acts as a disease with abnormal sensory
processing.
Multimodal analgesia, similar to multimodal
anesthesia, is the use of more than one class
of analgesic agent or analgesic technique to
treat pain. It is also called balanced analgesia.
Peripheral sensitization is defined as an
increase in sensitivity or decrease in the
threshold of peripheral nociceptive neurons
 produced by various inflammatory media-
tors such as histamine, serotonin, prosta-
glandins, and bradykinin.

spay and neuter clinics, and trap-neuter-release
environments. Surgical procedures can range
from spays and neuters to laparotomies and
amputations. Other procedures such as tattooing
and pre-euthanasia sedation all require proper
selection of anesthetic and analgesic agents. Feral
dogs and cats often require sedation or anesthesia
prior to being handled. This chapter describes the
basic and advanced anesthesia needs in these
environments.

ensure successful anesthetic protocols capable of
sustaining this high demand, three factors need
to be considered: skilled personnel,effective and
safe anesthetic drug combinations, and proper
anesthetic monitoring.
Trained personnel are vital to support a
successful program. Support personnel should be
trained and familiar with anesthetic drug combi-
nations, drug dosage calculations and record
keeping, surgical preparation, instrument sterili-
zation and packaging, anesthesia monitoring, and
patient recovery (288-290). The required skills
and areas offamiliarity are listed in Toble 67.

● Some pet owners request oral administration
 of a sedative to their pets prior to euthanasia.

 prior to injection of euthanasia solution is
important. Allowing proper time for

POTASSIUM CHLORIDE
●Potassium chloride (KCl) (10-20 mEq/kg
by IV bolus) is an alternative euthanasia
drug. The KCl overdose induces cardiac
arrest by mimicking hyperkalemia, resulting
in myocardial conduction blockage, cardiac
arrhythmias (bradycardia, tall T-waves,
prolonged Q-T interval, cardiac standstill),
and eventually cardiac fibillation.
+ This method can only be used ifan animal is
adequately anesthetized (i.e. not just sedated
since sedation does not render the animal
unconsciousness, and therefore the animal
may still suffer KCl-induced pain [see
above ]), as the cardiac arrest is painful.
● Chemical grade KCl dissolved in tap water
until saturation can be administered at
1 ml/l0 kg IV as a euthanasia solution for
 properly anesthetized dogs and cats.
The advantage of using KCl is that it is not a
controlled substance and it requires no
record keeping. The disadvantage is that it is
not a ready-to-use product and the animal
 must be properly anesthetized first.

Association.
 The use of two-stage euthanasia reduces the
chance of an agonal gasp occurring.
Administration of propofol, alfaxalone, or
thiopentone immediately prior to giving the
euthanasia solution reduces the frequency of
agonal gasping, often abolishing it
 completely. Opened, left-over propofol from 
anesthetic induction can be saved and used
for this purpose. Preplacement of an IV
 catheter will also facilitate propofol or
 alfaxalone administration.
+Propofol (4-8 mg/kg), alfaxalone
(3-5 mg/kg), or thiopentone
(10-15 mg/kg) can be used.
●Administering diazepam or midazolam (0.4

(0.2mg/kg IV) is an alternative method of
minimizing the likelihood of agonal gasping.
