Preface
My endeavour throughout the writing of this book has been to provide a clear
 and practical guide that is clinically useful for the breeder, veterinary student and
veterinary surgeon. I have tried to maintain an easy-to-read style with illustrations
that are relevant and explain the subject area and aid understanding of normal
 and abnormal reproduction as well as common reproductive techniques.
Much of my clinical and research work over the last 25 years has been in the
field of canine reproduction and this book represents my view of the subject area.
At the suggestion of colleagues the text is written as a monograph and is referenced
using my own peer-reviewed publications which demonstrate the impact of my
contribution to the field. I hope that my interest and explanations will inspire
further study in this exciting discipline.
The work involved in this book is a tribute to the late Dr W.E. Allen, my teacher
and friend.

Breeding, Reproduction and
Care of the Normal Animal
Care of the Juvenile,
Genetics and Planning
of Breeding
Puppies are most commonly weaned from their dam at approximately 6 weeks of
age and will then be placed into a new home.
the exact time of homing will depend upon the opinion of the breeder and the
availability of a new home; early placement at 6 weeks has many advantages
relating to behavioural development of the pup, but attention needs to be paid
to health care and preventative treatments
whilst pups may arrive in a new home “fully weaned', there are substantial
physiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract which are not complete until
several months of age; these put the pup at risk of gastrointestinal upset fol-
lowing minor dietary change
1.1
BEHAVIOURAL DEVELOPMENT
 there are several important phases of behavioural development, including (1)
 the neonatal period, (2) the transitional period, and (3) the socialization period
(Figure 1.1)
on arrival at a new home, pups will have passed through the neonatal and
transitional periods (these are discussed later in 15.2) and will be within the
socialization period which is probably one of the most important phases of its
life
Socialization period
this period classically starts at 3-4 weeks of age and is complete at approxi-
mately 12 weeks
 during this time pups should be learning to live as part of the pack (or
household)
the period starts with a general acceptance by the pup that anything experi-
enced is not harmful, therefore the pup will not be frightened by exposure to

something new; in the wild exposure to new things at an early age would be
regulated by the dam and therefore can be considered safe
the period ends with the pup responding to new stimuli with a fear response;
in the wild as the pup roams from the nest it is more likely to meet hostile situ-
ations and these things should first be treated as dangerous
as the pup moves through the socialization period it starts to learn what is safe,
what is dangerous and how to interact with others in the social hierarchy

1.2
2HEALTH CARE
There is substantial alignment of the socialization period with the immune system
of the pup; early in the socialization period the pup has acceptance of new stimuli
(at this time the pup will have protective immunity from the dam's colostrum)
whilst later new stimuli are met with a fear response (maternally derived antibodies
will be waning and the pup may not be protected).
a variety of routine preventative health care measures should be implemented
and due consideration should be given to dietary requirements
Dietary requirements
 it initially appears complex to understand the dietary requirements of a devel-
oping pup, however much research has been undertaken and the use of com-
mercially available preparations is scientifically sensible and safe in terms of
nutrient requirement and bacterial contamination (many home-prepared diets
do not meet the same standards for nutrients or bacteriological safety)
the nutrient requirement will be based upon the size of the pup, the likely size
at maturity (the expected growth rate) and the stage of development
the volume of food to be fed relates to the density of the food and its nutritional
value
owners normally feed to an expected volume of food in the feeding bowl and
forget that total weight of food fed is important
overfeeding of pups is common and may result in increased tendency to obesity
throughout life because of setting an expectation of a particular appetite as
well as the nature of fatty tissue that is developed
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 the balance between energy intake, protein and calcium is important and will
differ between breeds and body size of the dog and varies at the different stages
of development; it is important either to recognize the variable amounts
required if feeding home-prepared diets or to use commercially available prepa-
rations appropriate for the stage of development (age) of the pup
 it is important to recognize that commercially available complete diets for pups
should never be supplemented with additional minerals as this will result in
dietary imbalance and can result in skeletal deformity
Vaccinations
vaccination regimes are designed to stimulate the body to produce an immune
reaction to particular organisms
 pups will have received some antibodies from their dam (these are called mater-
nally derived antibodies)
maternal antibodies are not permanent but generally persist in the pup until 6
or 8 weeks of age but this varies from one infectious disease to another
if vaccination is performed when there are high levels of maternal antibodies
it is possible that vaccination will not be as successful as expected and therefore
the timing of vaccination is important
vaccinations are normally given for distemper infectious hepatitis, parvovirus,
parainfluenza, leptospirosis and Bordetella
most primary vaccination courses include two doses at approximately 10 and
12 weeks of age although an early vaccination may be given at 6 weeks in some
cases
 a later last vaccine dose may be required for canine parvovirus (e.g. at 14 or
16 weeks) because maternal derived antibody persists in the pups
 local veterinary surgeons are best placed to advise on suitable regimes since the
prevalence of disease varies from one location to another
Deworming
 many breeders will have either treated a bitch for endoparasites during preg-
nancy, and/or treated the pups when they were in the nest
establishing what regimes have been followed can be important and this will
influence which preventative treatments are given during puppy development
treatment is required for many different forms of internal parasites
Roundworms
 Toxocara is a roundworm that is most commonly seen in young pups and may
 o (s a  ssed ri r asal asas ods a
trointestinal disease
Care of the Juvenile, Genetics and Planning of Breeding
 if bitches have been infected before pregnancy larvae may remain dormant but
become re-activated in the last third of pregnancy and then pass to the pups;
pups are born infected and may produce many eggs themselves within a few
weeks of birth
 Toxocara is a potential zoonotic disease and regular de-worming is therefore
imperative and should be combined with careful hygiene measures to ensure
  s  p    
pups should be treated approximately every 4 weeks according to the instruc-
tion for the medicine supplied
Hookworms and tapeworms
Uncinaria and Ancyclostoma are hookworms which are not uncommon in hunt
and greyhound kennels

appropriately treated

1.3 PHYSIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT
Body size
 pups grow at a rapid rate over the first 10 months of life; small and medium-
sized dogs will reach adult body size at approximately 11 months of age,
whereas giant breeds may not reach adult bodyweight until 20 months of age
(Figure 1.2)
there is substantial increase in bone mass and increasing length of the long
bones
 normal bone and joint development can be adversely impacted by inadequate
diet (both composition and volume fed)
the period of growth is limited ultimately by the closure of bone growth plates,
but there is considerable variation between these for different bones and loca-
tions (for example proximal humeral epiphysis closes at an average of 375 days
whilst the medial and lateral humeral condyles close at an average of 187 days)
Body conformation
 juvenile pups normally appear relatively long-legged in appearance and this is
normal

 unfortunately there has been a societal drift into acceptance of ‘chunky'
 puppies being normal whereas “chunky puppies are actually overweight or
obese
 accurate evaluation of pups' body conformation is best performed using an
assessment of body condition score
 body condition scoring requires palpation of the dog and examining its outline,
either a 5- or a 9-point scale are used for simplicity. Here a 5-point scale is
described:
Score 1
Emaciated
 Ribs, spine and bony protrusions are easily seen.
These animals have little muscle mass and there is no observable
body fat.
May be described as bony, and starved in appearance.
Score 2
Thin
 Ribs, spine and other bones are easily felt.
These animals have an obvious waist when viewed from above and
have an abdominal tuck.
May be described as lean or skinny in appearance.
Care of the Juvenile, Genetics and Planning of Breeding
Score 31
 Normal
Ribs and spine are easily felt but not necessarily seen.
These animals have a waist when viewed from above and the abdomen
is raised and not sagging when viewed from the side.
May be described as ideal and often have a muscular appearance.
Score4
 Overweight
Ribs and spine are hard to feel or count underneath fat deposits.
These animals have no waist which is distended or pear-shaped when
viewed from above and the abdomen sags when seen from the side.
There are usually fat deposits on the hips, base of tail and chest.
May be described as heavy or stout.
Score 5
Obese
 Large fat deposits over the chest, back, tail base and hindquarters.
These animals have a sagging abdomen and there is no waist when
viewed from above.
The chest and abdomen often appear distended or swollen.
May be described as rounded or bloated.
Physical appearance and sexual behaviour
  snd a  a mq s rs o ar a
appearance at an early age
as puberty approaches in the male the production of male hormones (testoster-
one) results in some specific changes including increased body size, heavier
appearance of bones, lengthening of the penis and enlargement of the sheath,
substantial increase in size of the testes and epididymides, increased dominance
play and mounting behaviour
in females several months before the first (pubertal) oestrus there are elevated
concentrations of female hormones (oestrogens) which result in development
and enlargement of the vulva (which previously may have been small and
recessed) and slightly increased size of the mammary glands and teats
1.4 ONSET OF PUBERTY
Puberty is a term used to describe the transition (physiologically, morphologically,
behaviourally and functionally) from a juvenile to an adult.
usually growth of the dog or bitch has reached a plateau and changes to the
physical appearance mentioned above commence and progress
the onset of puberty is thought to be produced primarily by a change in the
hormonal output from a part of the brain called the hypothalamus; in the
10
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
juvenile period there is little activity within the hypothalamus (earlier in
 sasnd q pmo si assab ant sn q aa sm i mo
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) being produced
 the onset of puberty appears to be linked to attaining a critical body weight
and to maturation of nervous tissue within the hypothalamus
 the GnRH is conducted to the anterior pituitary gland where is stimulates the
release of two further hormones termed follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
luteinizing hormone (LH) which stimulate development of the testes and ovaries
the gonadotrophins (FSH and LH) are the same in the male and female
although it would appear strange terminology to have a follicle-stimulating
hormone in a male dog which has no follicles to stimulate
testosterone
stimulation of the ovaries results in the production of the female hormone
oestrogen
 testosterone and oestrogen are called reproductive sex steroids
the reproductive sex steroids are important in regulating sexual function but
they also have important effects on other tissues which result in changes in
their appearance and function
the effects of the reproductive sex steroids are therefore said to influence sec-
ondary sexual characteristics; in females this results in changes in size of the
genitalia and mammary glands as noted above
Puberty in the bitch (see also 3.2)
 normally reached approximately 2-3 months after achieving adult bodyweight;
between 6 and 24 months of age
 small breeds reach puberty earlier than large breeds
influenced by diet, genetic/line factors and cross-breeding
often the bitch demonstrates some temperamental changes in the few weeks
 before the first oestrus including more being restless or excitable and often an
increased urination (sometimes involving urine marking with one hind leg
raised)
 it is important to consider appropriate housing and management to ensure that
the bitch is held in a secure manner and does not escape
Puberty in the dog
 testes are normally present within the scrotum at birth
spermatogonal activity is frst detected at 5-6 months of age and first ejacula-
tions can be collected at approximately 8 months of age
 a longer transition to adult sexual performance is noted rather than the abrupt
occurrence of pubertal oestrus as in the bitch and mature semen quality is often
 not present until 12-15 months of age
Care of the Juvenile, Genetics and Planning of Breeding
11
 dogs become more boisterous as they approach puberty and there is increased
size of the testes but no other overt clinical signs
1.5
SELECTION OF ANIMALS FOR BREEDING
as dogs mature many will be considered as potential breeding stock, and deci-
sions are often made in relation to the appearance of the animal or the particu-
lar attributes that can be observed in him or her; this is described as the
'phenotype'
 it is important to recognize that the phenotype is a combined effect of the genes
that an animal carries (the *genotype') and the effect of environmental
conditions
selection of an animal for breeding therefore requires consideration of the
qualities of the animal itself as well as its parents and grandparents and its
brothers and sisters (siblings)
overall the aim of any breeder is to produce pups that are sound in terms of
temperament and health; the challenge is to select for a particular trait or suite
of phenotypes without development of unwanted traits as a consequence of
selection
 nowadays there are many sources of information available to help with selec-
tion of animals for breeding including specific health scoring schemes (such as
hip, eye, elbow schemes) and temperamental tests (such as response of the
animals to particular challenge circumstances)
for some characteristics statistical predictors of the relative genetic value of an
individual within a programme or breed are available; these are called esti-
mated breeding values (EBVs)
· EBVs are based upon genetic liability and do not account for environmental
influences
 guidance relating to the particular phenotypes for individual breeds are pub-
 lished as the Breed Standards and EBVs can be useful for estimating the impact
that a particular mating might have in terms of shifting the phenotype in any
particular direction
for some breeds where there are especial problems guidance notes may be
published (including International Breeding Guidelines) to help control specific
diseases
currently much attention is paid to selection of animals based upon health
criteria and much more attention needs to be paid to selecting for tempera-
mental soundness
·in future more information will become available about the specific gene
regions that are associated with the desirable or undesirable criteria that breed-
ers wish to select for or against; this will enable development of genomic
breeding values (geBVs)
 geBVs will therefore be available for animals at a very early age and as such
could be useful for selecting animals into a breeding programme before par-
ticular phenotypes are demonstrated
12
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
interestingly, in our laboratory we have documented heritability values for semen
qualityin dogs and proposed that itis possiblethat breedingselection mayimprove
semen quality [1]; no other studies have investigated this in dogs and it is impor-
tant to consider heritability of fertility when planning a breeding programme
1.6B
BASIC GENETICS
 dogs have 78 chromosomes grouped in 39 pairs (39 from the father are paired
with 39 from the mother - these are called homologous chromosomes)
 all cells contain these 78 chromosomes except sperm and oocytes where the
number is halved (they contain only one set and not a pair of chromosomes)
when sperm and eggs combine together at fertilization the chromosomes reform
into pairs so the developing embryo contains 39 pairs
 chromosomes carry genes which are made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
each gene is always found within the same chromosome and in the same place
(locus) within that chromosome
 coding within each gene is governed by the order in which nucleotide bases are
present; these bases are abbreviated to A,C,G,T (adenine, cytosine, guanine,
thymine)
since chromosomes are paired there will be two genes - one on each chromosome
 genes can be either dominant or recessive and the different forms of the gene
are called different alleles; when describing these forms it is convention to
denote dominant the dominant allele with a capital letter and the recessive with
a lower case letter
·a dog with either a single or both alleles that are dominant will display that
phenotype whereas for the recessive phenotype to be displayed both alleles need
to be recessive
when the two alleles are the same it is described as a homozygous state, whereas
when the alleles differ it is described as a heterozygous state
Example of dominants and recessives
consider a simple dominant recessive relationship which is coat colour in some
breeds of dog (note in some breeds a more complex mode of inheritance occurs
for coat colour and this is described later)
 two alleles are present black and brown; black is dominant (termed *B') and
brown is recessive (termed b')
the possible combinations for an individual dog are BB, Bb or bb, where
(a]
 BB = black phenotype (homozygous dominant)
[b]
 Bb = black phenotype (heterozygous)
[c]
bb = brown phenotype (homozygous recessive)
 the outcome from mating depends on which allles are present in the germ cells
(sperm or eggs); an animal that is homozygous dominant (BB) can only have
B alleles in germ cells, an animal that is heterozygous (Bb) will have some germ
cells that are B and others that are b

Polymorphism
some genes have more than two types of alleles
an example are the genes that cause the spotting of colour in the coat in some
breeds; here four different alleles exist but of course an individual can only
have two of the four. The versions are
[a]
 S = solid colour
[b]
s' = Irish spotting
[c]
s = Piebald spotting
[d)
s"= Extreme white

Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Epistasis
 some genes are influenced by other genes that are present at another position
in the DNA
the gene that influences the other is called an epistatic gene
this is nicely illustrated by the control of coat colour in Labradors where either
black, brown (called chocolate) or yellow colours occur (the yellow dogs may
have a dark- or a light-coloured nose)
 colour is determined by the black (B) or brown (b) allele as previously described,
but also by a further allele that can be present in dominant or recessive form
("E' or 'e’ respectively)
 the phenotypes and genotypes can be seen below:
Coat colour phenotype
Possible genotype

the only genotype that can be identified from the phenotype is yellow with a
liver nose that can only be bbee
it can be seen that something as simple as mating together two black dogs is
actually genetically very complicated since a black dog can be any of BBEE,
BbEE, BBEe, BbEe
 one example of this would be mating a BbEe stud to a BbEe bitch:

Sex determination
 male and female dogs both have 39 pairs of chromosomes but there are dif-
ferences in the appearance of one of these pairs between the sexes
Care of theJuvenile,Genetics and Planning of Breeding
15
in females all pairs are similar in size; but in males, in one pair, one chromo-
some is larger than the other - the large one is the same size as seen in the
same pair in females
 these chromosome pairs are called the sex chromosomes and the larger one is
designated *X' and the smaller one is designated *Y'; in this manner females
are XX and males are XY
when germ cells are produced by a bitch she can only have X chromosomes in
her eggs, whilst for the dog he will have sperm that contain either an X or a
Y chromosome
the sex of the fertilized egg will then depend upon which type of sperm fertilizes
the egg:

=Female
=Male
50% offspring will be male (XY)
50% offspring will be female (XX)
Sex linkage
 some genes are carried on the sex chromosomes; in fact very few are carried
 on the Y chromosome but some are carried on the X chromosome, including
for example those that are responsible for the disease haemophilia
the haemophilia gene is present in two alleles; the normal allele is dominant
(H} whilst the other abnormal allele is recessive (h)
in the female (who has 2 X chromosomes) the full gamut of normal (XHxH),
carrier (XHx') and affected (Xhx') will be seen
in the male (who has XY chromomes) there is only normal (XHY) and affected
(XhY)
results of breeding of affected and carriers can be estimated as before, for

BREEDING SCHEMES
breeders who wish to develop or exclude particular characteristics need to
understand the mode of inheritance of the condition; this may be an autosomal
for autosomal recessive traits it is imperative to understand whether an animal
is normal, carrier or affected; this may be established (a) with information
from the sire, dam, siblings and offspring especially by observing which litters
contain affected animals, or (b) from genetic tests (for example a blood sample
can be taken and gene mapping undertaken to establish if the dog is normal,
carrier or affected with progress
etinal atrophy)
for polygenetic inheritance it is possible to calculate the heritability of the trait
which is the degree of variation
that
 caused by the genetic makeup of the
animal; using this it is possible 
to estimate
: how much a population can be
shifted by breeding from animals above or below a threshold of the phenotype
(Figure 1.3)
in some cases there are clear numerical data assigned to the condition that is
to be selected for or against (e.g.
hip score, elbow score, some trainability
scores), in others the breeder subjectively
y assesses appearance of the individual;
the aim is to breed for the wanted characteristics and against the defects
commonly this involves breeding animals that are to some degree related
(inbreeding and line breeding) but can also involve selection of animals that
 have appropriate characteristics from another pedigree (outcrossing)

Inbreeding and line breeding
 mating two genetically related animals tends to result in increased homozy-
gosity in the programme and this is used to produce specific desired
characteristics
 in fact within a country most breeds of dog have a relatively small gene pool
and most animals have some degree of relation to each other
the differences between inbreeding and line breeding relate to how closely
related are animals that are bred together
strictly speaking inbreeding is defined as breeding animals that are more closely
related than the average of the population; however inbreeding it often taken
 to mean breeding animals that are very closely related (e.g. parent to offspring.
or two siblings), whereas line breeding is taken to mean breeding less closely
related animals (e.g. frst cousin mating)
the degree of inbreeding in a pedigree can be calculated using the “inbreeding
coefficient’ (measured on a scale of 0-1); mating two different breeds of
dog together would have an inbreeding coefficient of O, whilst mating a
brother to sister for many generations would finally result in an inbreeding
coefficient of 1
breeding from animals that have some relatives in common can be used to
select for a particular phenotype, generally has rapid results (within a few
generations) and can help to establish a phenotype, however it also risks estab-
lishing the unwanted genes and is essentially a genetic “dead-end’
there is some data to show inbreeding is associated with production of increased
stillbirths and decreased litter size
Outcrossing
 here animals that do not have shared ancestors are mated
the aim is to introduce a particular characteristic that is present in one line
to the other line
 the breeder needs to be clear that within the offspring, whilst some animals
will have the desired phenotype, this is likely to be a small proportion and the
remainder of animals are not suitable for future breeding
 the selected animal whilst having the appropriate phenotype will in general
have a heterozygous genotype and may not have the effect within a breeding
programme that would be expected, or would be seen from a traditional animal
that comes from a typical line-breeding programme
1.8
FIT TO BREED
finally the potential stud dog and potential brood bitch have been selected;
each must have passed the threshold criteria for health and temperament estab-
lished by the breeder
18
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
performance of a breeding soundness examination can be useful to assess
whether the individual is likely to have normal fertility (see Chapters 5 and
10); in the dog this should include collection of semen and full semen
evaluation
 for the bitch there is also a question of whether she is fit to breed; in particular
this decision is based upon the physical maturity of the bitch, her temperamen-
tal maturity, and her current state of health and body condition score
 nutritional factors influencing fertility are often overlooked but inadequate
 nutrition in both the male and female can have a significant impact
1.9
BREEDING AT THE FIRST (PUBERTAL) OESTRUS
 in a particular breeding programme there may be a desire to breed a bitch at
the first oestrus so that the interval to the next generation is as short as
possible
 the bitch's reproductive tract is clearly capable of sustaining a pregnancy at the
first oestrus
However
physiologically the bitch is not fully mature at the first oestrus (growth plate
closure for the entire skeleton is not completed)
 many bitches are not behaviourally mature at the first oestrus
some hereditary diseases have a late onset and may not be detectable by the
time of the first oestrus
 there is a lower pregnancy rate and litter size when breeding at the first oestrus
 there is a slightly increased risk of problems at whelping when bitches are bred
at the first oestrus
overall it might be argued that breeding at the pubertal oestrus should be avoided,
 however, some breeds reach puberty at a much later age than others, and some
individual bitches reach puberty at an age greater than the average - in these,
at least, breeding at the first oestrus is entirely reasonable

Anatomy of the Female
Understanding of the normal anatomy of the female reproductive tract is important
 to facilitate examination of the female for normality and to determine changes

the stage of the oestrous cycle.
2.1VULVA
 the opening to the female genital tract, bordered by the labia (often incorrectly
referred to as the *vagina')
situated ventral to the floor of the pelvis (the normal position may be altered
in animals with ambiguous genitalia, for example intersex)
derived embryologically from the urogenital sinus
size depends on: (a) breed, (b) stage of oestrous cycle (Figure 2.1)
assessment of vulval size and tone can be useful for determining the fertile
period specifically because there is swelling of the vulva in proestrus and then
a significant decrease in size that occurs approximately 2 days before ovulation
(see later)
2.2
VESTIBULE
 a short tube that connects the vulval opening to the vagina
 is a potential tube in that it is normally collapsed
on the ventral wall, cranial to the ventral vulval commissure, is the clitoris
which is suspended in a transverse fold of mucosa
the fossa surrounding the clitoris is a blind-ending cavity and the inexperienced
 may consider it to be the opening to the vestibule which it is not
the vestibular lumen runs cranially upwards at 60 degrees from the horizontal,

the vulva is swollen and discharge is still present; (d) early metoestrus, swelling is reduced
2.3
VESTIBULO-VAGINAL JUNCTION
 the junction between the vestibule and the vagina
in maiden bitches there is a constriction which indicates the position of the
hymenal vestige
in some bitches remnants of the hymen (commonly a dorso-ventral band which
 divides the vagina) are present and these may prevent mating or result in pain
at mating
 in some bitches the hymen is totally or partially intact, thus preventing mating
(see 16.3)
 the urethra opens just caudal to the vestibulo-vaginal junction on the ventral
floor

VAGINA

a potential tube lined by a stratified epithelium with longitudinally orientated
folds
immediately cranial to the external urethra orifice is a small ‘tongue-shaped
ridge of mucosa; this is often large when the bitch is in oestrus (this is often
the site where vaginal hyperplasia is first detected)
 cranially the vagina becomes narrow due to a dorsal median longitudinal fold
of mucosa; the caudal end of this fold is often mistaken for the cervix (see 5.7)
 approximately 0.5-1.5 cm caudal to the cranial limit of the vagina, on its dorsal
surface, is the opening (os) of the cervix
the cranial two-thirds of the vagina is derived embryologically from the paired
Mullerian ducts
the epithelium changes dramatically in relation to the endocrine environment

2.5 CERVIX UTERI
a short, thick-walled structure with a narrow lumen which connects the vagina
to the uterus
the cervical lumen is slightly tortuous
the vaginal opening (os) opens dorsally into the cranial vagina
the cervical canal is directed cranio-dorsally making catheterization of the
cervix very difficult

Figure 2.3  Uterus and ovaries from a bitch in early pro-oestrus showing uterine horns (h),
body (b) and cervix (c). The broad ligaments () are continuous with the mesovarium which
contains and surrounds the ovary (f).
ventral to the cervix is a blind-ending pouch of vagina
 the cervix enlarges during oestrus and can often be palpated transabdominally
 the cervical canal is patent during late pro-oestrus, oestrus, parturition and the
post-partum period; at other times it is usually closed
there is increased secretion of mucus from the cervix and vagina in bitches in
 pro-oestrus and oestrus; this can be clinically useful for determining the optimal
time to breed [1] (see 11.3}
2.6
UTERUS
this is Y-shaped and composed of a short body (corpus) and two long horns
(cornua) (Figure 2.3)
the body is connected to the cervix caudally and the tips of the horns com-
municate with the uterine (Fallopian) tubes cranially
 the length and width of the uterus is affected by both age and physiological
and pathological (see 16.5) changes
the uterine horns lengthen and begin to form folds during oestrus
 normal changes in the non-pregnant uterus are governed by circulating hor-
mones, principally oestrogen and progesterone (see Chapter 4)
Pre-puberty
 before puberty the uterus is small in diameter and the vascular supply is simi-
larly small (one reason why pre-pubertal neutering is preferred by many
surgeons)
examination of the cross-section of the uterine lumen shows that this has a
simple star-like' appearance and the endometrial glands are simple and poorly
developed
Anatomy of the Female
23
frequently there is only very sparse fat accumulation adjacent to the uterus
within the broad ligament (see 2.9)
Pro-oestrus
 at the onset of the first pro-oestrus the uterine vessels increase in size
the endometrium becomes thicker and more oedematous and the uterine lumen
takes on a complex appearance when examined in cross-section
 ultrasonographic appearance of the uterus is hypoechoic because of the endome-
trial oedema
the endometrial glands become more tortuous
extravasation of erythrocytes occurs into the lumen of the uterus, the sero-
sanguinous discharge passes via the cervix into the vagina and characterizes
the coloured discharge noted with early receptivity
Oestrus
 overall there is substantial increase in diameter of the uterus
the uterine vessels reach maximum size
there is less endometrial oedema and a reduction in the hypoechoic
appearance
uterine glands become more numerous and tortuous
extravasation of erythrocytes continues into the uterine lumen so that the col-
oured vulval discharge continues into this stage of the cycle
Metoestrus (dioestrus)
grossly the uterus has a ‘twisted’ (corkscrew) appearance associated with glan-
dular proliferation but reduced oedema
ovulation
 o q s ao siaq i r an ssi ai  
cystic dilations; the uterus is no longer twisted; polymorphonuclear neutrophils
 appear in the mucosa and necrotic epithelial tissue is seen in the lumen 
the terminology ^metoestrus' vs *dioestrus' is discussed in 3.5 (see Figure 3.1)
Anoestrus
the largely inactive phase of the reproductive cycle
the uterus has a similar appearance to pre-puberty but is not as small in
diameter
in some bitches where there has been cystic dilation of uterine glands, this
feature may persist into anoestrus
24
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
2.7
UTERINE (FALLOPIAN) TUBES
 the uterine tubes run from the tip of the uterine horn to the ovary
 the tubes run within the mesosalpinx and ovarian bursa taking a meandering
path which almost completely circumnavigates the ovary
considered to have a narrow isthmus at the uterine end and a wider ampulla
(where fertilization occurs) at the ovarian end; these regions cannot be grossly
differentiated
 terminate in fimbriae which are attached to the openings of the ovarian bursae
- the fimbriae channel the ovulated ova into the uterine tube
2.8
OVARIES
housed within the ovarian bursa and therefore not normally visible without
opening of the bursa
ovoid in shape when inactive (anoestrus) and attached to the inner surface of
the ovarian bursa
covered by a germinal epithelium, so that ovulation may occur anywhere on
the surface of the ovary (Figure 2.4)
the size of the ovary depends upon the stage of the oestrous cycle
Pre-puberty
 peripherally within the substance of the ovary there is a layer of primordial
follicles; these are small and not individually identifiable
follicles may contain more than one ovum, although at ovulation this is rare
        (  e    
granulosa cell layer surrounding the follicle is relatively thin; (b) a follicle in early oestrus,
the wall has luteinized and is producing progesterone but as yet this follicle has not
ovulated.
Anatomy of the Female
25
Pro-oestrus
follicles enlarge due to increasing size of their fluid-flled antra
overall the size of the ovary increases
the internal granulosa layer of each follicle is thrown into distinct folds
plasma oestrogen concentrations increase from late anoestrus throughout
pro-oestrus
Oestrus
a relatively small number of large follicles (4-8 depending upon breed) are
identifiable on each ovary [2]
the number of follicles is similar on each ovary and the exact number depends
upon the breed and age of the bitch
 the internal layer of granulosa cells luteinize before ovulation
this luteal tissue produces progesterone before ovulation (endocrinologically
the bitch has elevated progesterone concentrations when she is still in oestrus)
ovulation usually occurs in early oestrus
ova are released from follicles which do not collapse but remain filled with
fluid, presumably follicular fluid and blood
 luteal tissue continues to proliferate and results in gradual thickening of the
follicle/corpus luteal wall
Metoestrus (dioestrus)
the ovary is at its largest size
the early corpus luteum does not collapse and is centrally cavitated and con-
tains fluid
 progressive luteinization continues from ovulation onwards and occurs from
the wall inwards
 by approximately 20 days after ovulation the cavity of the corpus luteum is
completely replaced by luteal cells
after this time the corpora lutea gradually become smaller and the ovary is
nodular in outline
Anoestrus
 remnants of corpora lutea remain for several months and can be seen upon
gross inspection
the significance of these luteal remnants is as yet uncertain
ovaries are larger than before puberty but generally are small in size and have
a flat surface
26
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
in late anoestrus a new wave of follicular growth commences (often 45 days
before the onset of pro-oestrus)
2.9
MESENTERY
The supporting structures of the reproductive tract which attaches the reproductive
tract to the body wall, mainly dorsally.
and anatomical modifications:
[a]
suspensory ligament: runs cranially from the ovary to the dorsal abdomi-
nal wall, level with the last rib; it is a strong fibrous structure
[b]
mesovarium: bounded by the suspensory ligament cranially and continu-
ous with the mesometrium caudally; composed of loose connective tissue
containing fat and the ovarian vessels
[c]
ovarian bursa: a pouch of the mesovarium which completely covers the
ovary except for a small opening to the abdominal cavity; the fimbriae of
the Fallopian tube are attached to this opening
d
mesosalpinx: a fold of mesentery running between ovary and the uterus,
containing the uterine tube proper ligament of the ovary: a band of fibrous
tissue which runs between the ovary and tip of the uterine horn, parallel
to the mesosalpinx
e]
mesometrium: continuous with the mesovarium cranially; loose connec.
tive tissue containing the uterine vessels
2.10 BLOOD SUPPLY
 only the vessels encountered in routine surgical procedures are described:
a]
ovarian artery and vein: arise from aorta and empty into the vena cava
dorsal to the ovary (on the left the vein empties into the left renal vein);
they do not communicate with uterine vessels
b)
uterine artery and vein: arise from the pudendal vessels near the vagina;
they run cranially, parallel to each uterine horn to which they send regular
branches
2.11I
MAMMARY GLAND
 the number of mammary glands is variable but there are commonly five pairs
positioned along the ventral thorax and ventral abdomen
glands are designated according to location: thoracic, abdominal, inguinal, or
numbered from cranial to caudal (the first gland being the most cranial one)
 glandular tissue forms the basis of the gland and glandular regions are held
together with a fibrous capsule
Anatomy of the Female
27
contraction of muscle cells (myoepithelial cells) causes milk to be expelled into
the collecting duct system
 milk passes to the outside via teat orifices; there are between 7 and 14 teat
orifices per gland
mammary glands are small during anoestrus, pro-oestrus and oestrus
approximately 35 days after ovulation there is obvious mammary gland
development
this development occurs in all bitches, even those without clinical signs of false
pregnancy
at this time milk production is common
priming
milk production may be seen in both pregnant and non-pregnant bitches and
is associated with increased concentrations of the plasma hormone prolactin
 the blood supply to the mammary glands is important when considering surgi
cal removal of mammary tumours; equally important is the lymphatic drainage
which governs which glands need to be removed when neoplasia has been
diagnosed
 the cranial mammary glands (M1 and M2) are supplied via the cranial thoracic
artery; the mid gland (M3) is supplied by the cranial epigastric artery, the
caudal glands (M4 and M5) are supplied by the caudal epigastric and the
external pudendal artery
 there is lymphatic communication between glands M1 and M2 with drainage
occurring cranially to the axillary lymph node
there is lymphatic communication between glands M3 and M4, with M4 and
M5 draining caudally to the superficial inguinal lymph node

Physiology of the Female
Understanding the normal cyclicity and the terminology for the stages of the cycle
is a key aspect to understanding reproduction in the bitch. This is particularly the
case because the physiology in the bitch is very different to that of other species.
Misunderstanding of the normal physiology is one of the most common causes of
infertility in this species.
3.1 TERMINOLOGY
 the terminology that is commonly used is often confusing due to historical
mistakes, comparisons with other species and a tendency to *borrow' inap-
 propriate terminology from other species
 some terms are more acceptable because of traditional usage rather than sci-
entific accuracy (Figure 3.1)
3.2 PRE-PUBERTY
The period between birth and the beginning of the first pro-oestrus.
puberty can occur between 6 and 24 months or more and is substantially
dependent upon the breed; with small-sized breeds reaching puberty earlier
than large breeds
 throughout pre-puberty the bitch has no swelling or enlargement of the
mammary glands or vulva and there is no normal discharge from these
structures
behaviourally the bitch is playful and immature
commonly the coat retains a soft and fine appearance like that seen in puppies,
the bitch is often lean and not well muscled

PRO-OESTRUS
lasts on average for 9 days but is very variable in duration
often the first pro-oestrus is longer than expected and can be thought to be
abnormal
initial signs are swelling of the vulval lips and the appearance of a sero-
sanguinous (red-coloured) discharge from the vulva
the quantity of discharge varies greatly and is of no clinical significance
the discharge may not be seen in some bitches as they remove it by licking
urination becomes more frequent (small quantities) to disseminate pheromones
produced by the vestibular mucosa
commonly bitches play with males and may seek their attention
the bitch is attractive to male dogs but will not usually allow coitus
 ovulation may occur towards the end of this period but normally occurs during
oestrus
3.4
OESTRUS
lasts on average 9 days but is very variable in length
by definition this phase commences when bitch will first readily allow coitus
by definition oestrus ends when bitch subsequently refuses to allow coitus
the discharge from the vulva may become less copious and less haemorrhagic
but this is not a constant feature, i.e. some bitches have scant discharge
which persists after the end of oestrus
 ovulation usually occurs towards the beginning of oestrus
 in the author's laboratory we have shown for the frst time the large variation
in the endocrine events occurring in normal bitches; ovulation may occur
within a few days of the onset of pro-oestrus or may take many weeks [1]
 it appears that the length of time that follicles take to develop is very variable
(Figure 3.2); the following may happen:

 ovulation may occur as late as 30 days after the onset of pro-oestrus; the
bitch is still receptive at this time
[d)
ovulation may occur as late as 30 days after the onset of pro-oestrus; the
bitch is not receptive at this time
in addition, the time of ovulation may not be consistent during successive heats
in the same bitch
 in our clinic we have undertaken some pivotal studies investigating growth and
ovulation of follicles [2]; these showed a surprising long period of follicle
recruitment compared with other species
 use of ultrasound to study follicular dynamics will become an important diag-
nostic tool following demonstration of abnormal cycles in our work [2]
bitches release (ovulate) several eggs (oocytes) at each cycle; ovulations do
 not occur at the same time and this process usually takes approximately 72
hours
 most ovulations occur 48-72 hours after the plasma peak of luteinizing
hormone
 because dog spermatozoa can live for up to 7 days in the bitch, and because
0ocytes are not ready for fertilization until 2 days after ovulation, bitches which
are mated by more than one dog can have mixed litters
in cases of paternity disputes genetic “finger printing' is almost 100%
accurate
the duration of time that eggs (oocytes) are available to be fertilized (called the
"fertilization period’) is very long in the dog compared with other species; this
can result in a large difference in the time that whelping commences when
pregnancy length is calculated from the day of mating (see also 11.2)
Physiology of the Female

3.5
METOESTRUS (DIOESTRUS) [3]
 in many species metoestrus is used to describe the early part of the luteal phase
(often for approximately 5 days after ovulation) whereas dioestrus is the
 in the bitch the term metoestrus is traditionally used to describe the majority
of the luteal phase after the end of oestrus; there is little logical reason for this,
and the word dioestrus is more accurate
 in the bitch metoestrus begins when the bitch first refuses coitus
 overall metoestrus lasts about 60 days and terminates when circulating proges-
terone concentrations become minimal; there is no clinical sign which heralds
the end of metoestrus
after the end of oestrus the vulva gradually becomes less swollen and any
 haemorrhagic discharge usually ceases during early metoestrus
 a mucoid vulval discharge may develop approximately 1 month into metoe-
strus, similar to that seen in pregnancy (see 12.5)
 pseudopregnancy (see 3.7) often occurs during late metoestrus
3.6
6ANOESTRUS
the period of ovarian inactivity between the end of metoestrus (or pregnancy)
and the beginning of the next pro-oestrus
 this is normally approximately 4 months in duration but can be very variable,
i.e. from 1 month to 2 years
the length of anoestrus may be influenced by:
[a]  t
time of year: some bitches retain the primitive tendency for one period of
pro-oestrus/oestrus a year, e.g. the Basenji breed; in other breeds more
bitches may enter pro-oestrus/oestrus in spring than at other times
{b)
pheromones: bitches housed together often exhibit pro-oestrus/oestrus
around the same time; it is thought that pheromones from one oestrous
bitch may stimulate others
[c]
 unknown factors: the signal responsible for causing folicular growth in
most bitches is still unknown
the advent of pro-oestrus may be predicted in some bitches by coat changes;
where detection of the next pro-oestrus is important it may be sensible to collect
a vaginal smear at a regular interval since the presence of red blood cells in the
vaginal smear is predictive of the return to pro-oestrus
3.7
FALSE PREGNANCY (see also 19.8)
synonyms include phantom pregnancy, pseudopregnancy and pseudocyesis
false pregnancy is common and normal
 every non-pregnant bitch will have some clinical signs of false pregnancy
32
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 the clinical signs of false pregnancy are caused by elevated plasma prolactin
concentrations
classical signs include milk production and lactation, anorexia (but not weight
loss), shivering, reluctance to leave the home, territorial aggression, nesting and
mothering objects
less common signs include minor changes in behaviour sometimes described as
'irritability'
signs usually occurs 4-6 weeks after oestrus, but can occur at any time in some
bitches
represents a primitive mechanism for bitches to nurture other pups in the dog
 pack when pro-oestrus/oestrus occurred once a year i.e. when the pack exhib-
ited synchronized breeding
 the signs usually regress spontaneously after 10-30 days and in most bitches
no medical treatment is required
sometimes requires treatment if owners cannot cope with the clinical change
in the bitch, if the signs are exaggerated (e.g. aggression) or if she develops
mastitis
there is only one episode of false pregnancy after each oestrus, but when
hormone therapy is used in attempt to control the signs, repeated bouts may
occur (see 27.1)
although normal, false pregnancy is also discussed under endocrinological
abnormalities (see 19.8)
Some myths about false pregnancy
Progesterone

not true because:
[a]
 false pregnancy can be treated with progestogens (see 27.1)
[b]
 bitches with false pregnancy do not have higher circulating concentrations
of progesterone than others at the same stage of the cycle
[c]
 bitches with false pregnancy do not produce progesterone for longer than
others
[d]
bitches with false

concentrations

signs of false pregnancy can be suppressed by giving drugs that inhibit
prolactin secretion, e.g. cabergoline (see 27.9)
Owert and covert false pregnancies
· it is often said that all bitches have a false pregnancy which in some is overt
and in others is covert; this is not true and confusion has arisen due to the
terminology used in other species
 all bitches have mammary swelling and the production of some milk

33
the clinical signs of pseudopregnancy encompass a large range with some
bitches showing no signs and others exhibiting marked behavioural changes
 most cases can be considered physiological and normal and it is often the
concern of the owner that governs which animals require treatment
the situation in the cat and rat should not be confused with that in the dog:
dogs are spontaneous ovulators (mating is not required)
and-uou pu suuad un sep 0-og noqe rog uou ean enodo
bitches; in non-pregnant bitches this period of time is termed metoestrus or
dioestrus (see 3.5)

pregnancy
clinical signs of false pregnancy do occur in some bitches during metoestrus;
Pyometra
 it is sometimes said that bitches that have false pregnancies are more prone to
pyometra; this is not true but:
[a]
false pregnancy and pyometra occur at the same stage of the cycle
(metoestrus)
(b)  a bitch that has had progestogen treatments for false pregnancies may be
 more likely to develop pyometra as a result
Irregular oestrous cycles
● it is sometimes said that bitches with irregular oestrous cycles are more likely
to develop false pregnancies; this is not true
Parity
 it is sometimes said that allowing a bitch to have a litter will stop subsequent
false pregnancies; this is not true
Ovariobysterectomy
 it is sometimes thought that bitches which have signs of false pregnancy after
ovariohysterectomy have ovarian tissue which has not been removed; this may
be true but:
 most false pregnancies that occur after ovariohysterectomy are the result
of surgery just before or during a false pregnancy. Removal of the ovaries
causes plasma progesterone concentration to decline and results in a surge
release of prolactin
b]
 if a bitch does have a false pregnancy after ovariohysterectomy it is usually
preceded by a period of oestrus if ovarian tissue is present

Endocrinology of the Female
The previous chapter described the different phases of the oestrous cycle and of
course these stages are determined by the hormonal changes that occur.
 hormone action is mediated by receptors on target tissues; these receptors
change in distribution throughout the oestrous cycle [1]
4.1 GONADOTROPHIN-RELEASING HORMONE (GnRH,
RARELY TERMED LHRH)
released in a pulsatile manner in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus
(Figure 4.1)
reaches the
      d  g
circulation
the hormone attaches to the cells which produce follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) (see 4.2) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (see 4.3) to stimulate their pro-
duction and release; it is thought that differences in pulse quality of GnRH
select for FSH or LH release
 the effect of GnRH binding to the the receptors is transient because binding
affinity is low; GnRH is rapidly released by the receptors and quickly
metabolized
 synthetic analogues or agonists of GnRH (e.g. deslorelin) have been developed;
these have increased potency due to their ability to remain attached to binding
sites and to resist metabolism; after initial stimulation, long-acting agonists
cause inactivity (down-regulation) of gonadotrophin-producing cells because
pulsatile stimuli are prevented
 antagonists of GnRH have also been developed to compete for binding sites;
these block endogenous activity but do not cause the initial stimulation seen
with agonists (the agents are however expensive and have a number of adverse
effects and have not been introduced into clinical practice)

FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (FSH)
 a gonadotrophin produced by and released from the anterior pituitary gland
as a result of stimulation by GnRH
 it is responsible for the stimulation of the growth of follicles in the ovaries
 all factors which initiate its release are not known
circulating concentrations in bitches are not well documented

LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH)
a gonadotrophin produced in and released from the pituitary gland as a result
of GnRH stimulation
 it is released in short bursts or pulses
oestrus [2]
Endocrinology of the Female
37
LH stimulates the maturation, luteinization and ovulation of ovarian follicles
circulating concentrations rise rapidly to reach a peak about 48 hours before
the majority of ovulations (ovulations may occur over a 72-hour period)
this peak occurs usually in late pro-oestrus or early oestrus (Figure 4.1}
this hormone also has some luteotrophic action (maintains the function of
corpora lutea)
4.4
OESTROGENS
steroid hormones produced by growing follicles
mainly 17alpha-oestradiol, 17beta-oestradiol and oestrone, some of which may
be conjugated
circulating oestrogen concentrations rise a little before the beginning of
pro-oestrus
a sharp rise in blood concentrations occurs later into pro-oestrus, resulting in
a peak about 48 hours before the surge of LH (Figure 4.2)
oestrogens cause a variety of clinical signs which occur in pro-oestrus:
[a]
vulval discharge (a result of uterine bleeding)
[b]
thickening of the vaginal mucosa and epithelium

change in cervical mucus consistency

PROGESTERONE [3]
4.5
 a steroid hormone produced by mature follicles (just before ovulation) and
corpora lutea after ovulation and for the duration of their lifespan
circulating concentrations start to rise around the time of the oestrogen peak
(Figure 4.2); the hormone is produced by luteinizing granulosa cells in the
 unruptured follicles (this is unusual compared with many domestic mammals)
it is possible to reliably and accurately measure bitch progesterone using ELISA
techniques and these can detect the pre-ovulatory increase in progesterone [4]
plasma values increase steadily and are significantly raised by the time of
ovulation
 maximal concentrations are reached about 20 days after the end of oestrus,
whether the bitch is pregnant or not
 a gradual decline in values then occurs until they become basal at about 60-70
days after ovulation
the luteal phase is almost identical in pregnancy and non-pregnancy; in fact
the non-pregnant luteal phase is slightly longer and progesterone concentration

prolactin causes behavioural changes typically seen in late pregnancy and
lactation
in nursing bitches, blood concentrations of prolactin are very high for some
time after parturition (Figure 4.4)
prolactin causes signs of pseudopregnancy (see 3.7 and 19.8)
prolactin is also luteotrophic (maintains the function of corpora lutea); the
luteotrophic action of prolactin is often overlooked or poorly understood but
this role of prolactin is very important when considering pharmacological
methods that are available to manipulate the cycle of the bitch (see 27.9)

PROSTAGLANDINS
in many species prostaglandin is produced by the uterus in non-pregnant
females to terminate the luteal phase and cause a return to oestrus

40
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 in the non-pregnant bitch corpora lutea appear to become non-functional
gradually, due either to lack of trophic support (possibly LH and/or prolactin)
or because they have an inherent lifespan
 in the pregnant bitch, however, prostaglandin causes final lysis of the corpora

the mechanisms of action of prostaglandin in pregnant bitches appears to be

 txogenous administration of prostaglandin can be used to terminate the luteal
phase of pregnancy or non-pregnancy, although there are some interesting
requirements for prostaglandin administration to produce this effect

Clinical Examination of
the Female
Clinical examination of the reproductive tract is the mainstay of investigation of
normality and abnormal function. A logical ordered approach to the examination
is essential to ensure that no important features are overlooked.
5.1  BASIC EXAMINATION OF THE
REPRODUCTIVE TRACT
This consists of:
visual examination of the perineum and vulva
 palpation of the mammary glands
collection of vaginal cells for the study of vaginal exfoliative cytology
digital examination of the vestibule and caudal vagina
endoscopic examination of the vestibule, vagina and cervix
 real-time ultrasonographic imaging
measurement of plasma hormone concentrations
5.2 ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES THAT MAY BE
CONSIDERED
These include:
bacteriological examination of the reproductive tract
endocrinological stimulation tests
 cytological examination of suspected pathological tissue
 laparoscopy or laparotomy techniques
karyotyping

5.3 VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE PERINEUM
allows confirmation of anatomic normality or abnormality
may allow the stage of the oestrous cycle to be predicted (swelling occurs during
pro-oestrus and oestrus)
 may allow the detection of intersex abnormalities (see Chapter 18)
5.4 PALPATION OF THE MAMMARY GLANDS
 mammary glands and nipples are small prior to puberty
 mammary glands are usually small during anoestrus and pro-oestrus
 mammary gland size and nipples may be large in multiparous bitches
approximately 35 days after ovulation there is increased size of the mammary
glands:
[a]
 at this time there is often milk production
(b)   pseudopregnancy is common and normal

5.5 VAGINAL EXAMINATION
Vaginal cytology
To understand the changes in vaginal cytology it is helpful to consider the histo-
logical changes in the vaginal epithelium:
 it is critically important to implement appropriate quality control measures in
any diagnostic laboratory; work in the author's laboratory was the first to
consider quality assurance measures for canine reproductive laboratories and
to document levels of appropriate control that can be achieved [1]
Changes througbout the oestrous cycle
Prepuberty and anoestrus
 epithelium consists of two layers, the outer of which appears pseudostratified
there is no leucocytic infiltration
Pro-oestrus
the epithelium gradually becomes stratified squamous of approximately 16 cells
in thickness at the end of pro-oestrus
hyperplasia, hypertrophy and mitoses are seen in the basal layers
Clinical Examination of the Female
43
 the superficial squamous cells become large and irregular in outline and are
usually keratinized
there is no leucocytic infiltration
Oestrus
 the stratified squamous epithelium persists throughout the fertile period
there is no leucocytic infltration
Metoestrus (dioestrus)
the squamous epithelium starts to slough abruptly approximately 7 days after
ovulation when progesterone concentrations reach high values
the epithelium returns to a smaller number of layers often between three and
six cells
the epithelium and lamina propria are infltrated with polymorphonuclear
neutrophils
by mid metoestrus the epithelium returns to two cells in thickness and cellular
infltration has subsided
Examination of vaginal cytology
 cells may be collected by a variety of different methods before staining and
microscopic examination; the methods are described below
the appearance of cells collected can be used to determine the various stages
of the oestrous cycle (Figure 5.1) as well as the optimal time for breeding
Anoestrus
epithelial cells: these are mainly round cells with active nuclei and a small
cytoplasm. The smaller cells (parabasal cells) originate close to the basement
membrane of the mucosa; the larger cells are produced by cell division and are
known as (small) intermediate cells
 polymorphonuclear neutrophils: usually present in small to moderate numbers
erythrocytes: absent
bacteria: usually absent
Pro-oestrus
 epithelial cells: immediately before, and also during, early pro-oestrus the
number of large intermediate cells (with an increased cytoplasmic:nuclear ratio
compared with the small intermediate cells) in the smear increases
towards the end of pro-oestrus there is an increase in the proportion of cells
which are large and irregular in outline and which become keratinized, i.e.

oestrus: characterized by small intermediate epithelial cells. (b) Early oestrus: characterized
by large intermediate epithelial cells (arge numbers of erythrocytes are also present).
(c) Oestrus: characterized by large intermediate epithelial cell which are now very large and
irregular in outline. (d) Oestrus: at the optimal time of mating the majority of epithelial cells
are anuclear. (e) Metoestrus/dioestrus: characterized by cellular debris and large number of
 polymorphonuclear neutrophils. (f) Unstained smear from a bitch in pro-oestrus showing
forming crystallization pattern. (g) Unstained smear from a bitch in oestrus showing
significant crystallization pattern. (h) Vaginal smear post mating showing spermatozoa, two
polymorphonuclear neutrophils, erythrocytes and a single large intermediate epithelial cell.
Clinical Examination of the Female
45
appear straight-sided with smaller nucleus and where keratin can be detected
with specific staining
polymorphonuclear neutrophils: present in small numbers initially but gradu-
ally decrease; usually PMNs are absent at the end of pro-oestrus
erythrocytes: usually present in large numbers throughout pro-oestrus, however
the number is of no clinical significance; sometimes they are lysed during prepa-
ration of the vaginal smear
bacteria: often present and increase in number throughout pro-oestrus
Oestrus
critical information relating to the clinical application of vaginal cytology has
been published from the author's laboratory that has led to wide understanding
and application of the technique [2,3]
· epithelial cells: early in oestrus maximal cornification (keratinization) occurs,
i.e. between 60 and 90% of cells are straight sided and have small (pyknotic)
nuclei or no nucleus (they are then called squames)
NB: A *false’ or early peak of cornification sometimes occurs before the real peak;
this can be recognized by the vague (pale staining) nature of the squames - the
cause of this is unknown but it is not reported by those who use trichrome stains.
 polymorphonuclear neutrophils: usually absent throughout oestrus
erythrocytes: may be absent, few or many; numbers are of no clinical
significance
· bacteria: present usually in large numbers until the end of oestrus
Metoestrus (dioestrus)
 epithelial cells: at the end of oestrus there is a sudden change to all the epithelial
cells becoming intermediate or parabasal, and present in large numbers; as
metoestrus proceeds cell numbers decrease and cells are similar to those in
anoestrus
 polymorphonuclear neutrophils: at the end of oestrus there is a massive influx
 of these cells; as metoestrus proceeds, numbers decrease but some are always
 present
erythrocytes: usually absent but may be seen in early metoestrus and are of no
clinical significance
bacteria: disappear dramatically at end of oestrus, coincident with influx of
neutrophils and the appearance of mucus and debris
there is commonly a significant amount of mucus present in the vaginal smear
of bitches in metoestrus
NB: Vaginal smears are similar in metoestrus and pregnancy.

Preparation of vaginal smears
collection of vaginal material can be achieved in a number of ways
Bacteriological swab
insert a bacteriological swab into the vestibule and caudal vagina to absorb
exudate; gently roll the swab onto a microscope slide
this method is not ideal because:
[a]
vestibular cells are also collected
[b]
in metoestrus and anoestrus mucus is collected; this dries (fixes) slowly
on the slide and causes distortion of cells
C]
the physical rolling of the swab on the slide causes cell disruption
[d]
elements from the swab are included in the smear
 the method can be improved by using a speculum or cylindrical guide to prevent
contamination with vestibular cells
Spatula
scrape material from the vaginal wall using a metal spatula
this method is not ideal because:
[a]
very little material is collected
[b)
the material is difficult to spread over the microscope slide
[c]
the degree of pressure in scraping may result in deeper or more superficial
layers of cells being collected
Aspiration
aspirate material from the caudal vagina using a catheter or pipette; place a
drop of exudate on a microscope slide and spread as a blood smear
during metoestrus and anoestrus a small amount of saline can be introduced
into the vagina and re-aspirated, to collect a suspension of cells; if the smear
is made and dried immediately, cell distortion does not occur
this method produces a clear undistorted smear, and the collected material can
also be used for examination of mucus crystallization in oestrus (see 11.3)
 in the author's view this method is ideal
Staining vaginal smears
·can be achieved in a number of ways
Shorr's method
 using three different stains to produce a trichrome technique
advantages:
Clinical Examination of the Female
47
[a]
differentiates between keratinized (orange) and non-keratinized (blue)
epithelial cells
{b]
from this an index of keratinization (eosinophilic index) can be
calculated
disadvantages:
[a} 
 there is no absolute value of the eosinophilic index which indicates ovula-
tion time
[b]
 the staining method is complicated and very time consuming if individual
stains are used, and components require regular filtering or renewal
NB: Trichrome stains like Shorr's are excellent for human vaginal cytology where
many slides are processed each day; bitch vaginal smears are usually taken too
infrequently to justify the use of a complicated staining technique.
Methylene blue
using a single stain which is poured onto an air-dried slide for 5-20 minutes
before being washed with water before immediate examination
advantages:
[a]
very simple
(b) rapid
disadvantages:
[a]
 must examine the wet slide immediately, as drying causes distortion of
the cells
[b)
 examining wet slides under high power may cause condensation on the
objective lens
[c)
 no permanent record of the slides can be kept
Leishman's stain
using a single stain to flood the air dried for 2-3 minutes before adding 2 ml
of phosphate buffer gently so that surface tension prevents dripping; a metallic
sheen will be seen on the surface of the diluted stain which is washed off after
 20 minutes before drying and examination
advantages:
(a)  relatively simple
(b)   medium speed of preparation
disadvantage:
[a]
 the long staining step sometimes results in the sample being left for too
long and therefore drying out
Rowmanowski stains (e.g. Diff-Quik)
using a fixative and two stains the air-dried slide is dipped sequentially six times
into each of the three solutions, washed immediately with water and allowed
to dry before examination
48
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
advantages:
(a) rapid
(b)  gives consistent results
disadvantages:
[a]
expensive
[b]
 one solution (fixer) evaporates rapidly (even if not used)
[c) 
solutions must be changed frequently
Interpretation of vaginal smears
There is a variety of uses of vaginal smears but commonly this is to establish the
stage of the oestrous cycle or for the demonstration and identification of abnormal
cells.
Determination of optimal mating time (see also Chapter 11)
· vaginal cytology is an important indirect method of monitoring hormonal
events (particularly elevation of plasma oestrogen - see 3.4); the scope for
anticipating future changes is limited
vaginal cytology can only be useful for indicating the fertile period and not the
fertilization period; i.e. the broad period of time when mating or insemination
is likely to result in pregnancy (see 11.2)
 the first smear should be taken approximately 5 days after the frst observed
signs of pro-oestrus, as some bitches may be close to ovulation at this time
 depending on the cellular content, repeat the smears every 2-3 days, unless it
is clear that the bitch is very early in pro-oestrus
 to calculate the percentage of anuclear cells:
number of anuclear cells
anuclear cell index = -
x100
 total number of epithelial cells examined
 mating should be recommended when usually more than 8o% of cells are
anuclear and there is an absence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (Figure
11.4} [2]
the sudden decrease in the anuclear cell index, and a return of a large number
of polymorphonuclear neutrophils denotes the end of the fertilization period
Diagnosis of vaginitis (see 16.3 and Figure 5.1)
excess vulval discharge at a time when no discharge is normally present sug-
gests vaginal or uterine disease
male dogs are often interested in bitches with vulval discharge, even when they
are not in oestrus
 it is difficult to define vaginitis in the bitch because there are polymorphonu-
clear neutrophils present at all stages except during oestrus
Clinical Examination of the Female
49
 very large numbers of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in vaginal smears suggest
uterine disease (pyometra: endometrial cells may also be seen)
 many vulval discharges are normal, i.e. during metoestrus and pregnancy, and
may simply indicate increased mucus production
many bitches considered to have excessive vulval discharge have very few poly.
morphonuclear neutrophils in vaginal smears and are probably normal
bacteriological findings are discussed later
vaginal smears are invaluable for distinguishing bitches which are in pro-
oestrus/oestrus from bitches which are otherwise attractive to male dogs
Pregnancy diagnosis
 vaginal smears cannot be used as a method of pregnancy diagnosis
 smears will not distinguish between metoestrus, pregnancy and anoestrus
Crystallization (ferning) patterns in vaginal (cervical) mucus
(Figure 5.1f,g)
 there is little use of this technique in veterinary practice, but it can provide
additional information to demonstrate the stage of the oestrous cycle, especially
oestrus and the fertile period
 work from our laboratory has demonstrated that this technique is simple and
effective at documenting the broad time of the fertile period [3]
Collection ofsamples
vaginal secretion is best collected by pipette or catheter as described earlier
 a drop of the exudate is placed onto a microscope slide and held vertically to
allow the drop to ‘run'
do not examine until the slide is completely dry
txamine under x40 objective with the condenser lowered to enable greatest
contrast of material
Interpretation of mucus crystallization
 the smear is examined for both the type of ferning pattern and the area of the
smear covered by this pattern
 the ferning pattern is scored arbitrarily using five classes from minor ferning
(with short stems and irregular stellate patterns) to bold ferning (with long
stems and clear veination and subveination)
the surface area is scored using five classes from less than 1% cover, to greater
than 20% cover
 the two scores may be added to calculate the ferning index (values O-10)
50
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
ferning is most intense and covers a greater area of the smear after the second
peak of cornification of epithelial cells; it may therefore help differentiate the
first and second peak [2]
 individual bitches do not always reach a peak ferning index score of 10
vaginal washings will give erroneous results due to the addition of water; with
this method, crystallization can be seen in metoestrous samples
5.6
DIGITAL EXAMINATION OF THE
REPRODUCTIVE TRACT
clean the vulva of gross contamination and then prepare the area using an
raea puq peins e se yns udad peoq
gently insert a lubricated gloved finger
the vestibule is directed upwards to the vagina
the external urethral orifice can be palpated on the ventral surface at the
vestibulo-vaginal junction
the vagina is dry in anoestrus and metoestrus (dioestrus), but moist during
pro-oestrus and oestrus
it is possible to detect hymenal remnants or abnormalities of the vestibulo-
vaginal junction (strictures, see 16.3)
 it is possible to detect hyperplasia of the vaginal floor during oestrus (see 16.3)
5.7.
ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE FEMALE
REPRODUCTIVE TRACT
 bitches in oestrus may allow endoscopic examination with or without sedation;
at other times sedation or general anaesthesia may be necessary
auroscopes, even with long nozzles, are too short for thorough examination
most bitch vaginal speculae also only reach to the vestibulo-vaginal junction
rigid cold-light endoscopes and those with fexible fibreoptics give best results
but:
a]
it may be difficult to focus on the vaginal wall unless the canal is distended
with air or water
[b]
the caudal limit of the dorsal median fold may be mistaken for the cervix
[c]
the cranial half of the vagina is very narrow, especially in the non-oestrous
bitch, and may be difficult to visualize (see Figure 2.2)
[d]
on many occasions unless the bitch is in oestrus the vaginal os of the
cervix will not be seen
[e]
examination to elucidate the cause of abnormal discharge is usually unre-
warding because the discharge may flood the feld of view; in these cases
lavage with volumes of saline may be helpful
vaginal endoscopy may be useful for the assessment of the optimal mating time
(see Chapter 11) and certain cases of reproductive tract disease

Interpretation (Figure 5.2)
General changes
 anoestrus: vaginal folds are flat and may disappear when the vagina is insuf-
flated; they appear red due to the underlying capillaries and overall the mucosa
is dry
 pro-oestrus: vaginal folds become larger, rounder, moister and paler; sanguin-
ous discharge is seen between the folds
early oestrus: the folds become wrinkled and subdivided into smaller rounder
folds
late oestrus: the secondary folds become angulated and the vagina appears dry
 metoestrus: the folds become rounded and less distinct and the mucosa appears
patchy due to loss of the cornified layer
Quantification of changes to establish the optimal time to breed
(see also Chapter 11)
bitches in anoestrus have a red and dry mucosa with low and flattened mucosal
folds; this is described as the inactive phase (I)
52
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 increased oestrogen causes thickening and oedema of the mucosa which appears
turgidly swollen, rounded and grey/white in colour; this is described as the
oedematous phase (O)
a decrease in oestrogen and rise in progesterone causes reduced turgidity with
 progressive furrowing, wrinkling and indentations; this is described as the early
and late shrunken phase (S1, S2)
such that the peaks are sharp-tipped and irregular in appearance; this is
described as the early, middle and late angulation phase (A1, A2, A3)
 after the end of the fertilization period when progesterone concentrations
are high there is a progressive decline in the size of the mucosal fold profle;
this is designated as the early, middle and late decline phase (D1, D2,
D3, D4)
 the decline phase is followed by a return to a phase characterized by a
thin, red and dry mucosa with low and flattened mucosal folds; the inactive
phase (I)
5.8  ULTRASONOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF THE
FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT
Principles of diagnostic ultrasound
diagnostic ultrasound utilizes sound frequencies between 2 and 10 MHz
ultrasound is produced by application of an alternating voltage to piezoelec.
tric crystals which change in size and produce a pressure or ultrasound
wave. Returning echoes deform the same crystals which generate a surface
voltage
 most diagnostic ultrasound machines use the principle of brightness modula-
tion (B-mode) where the returning echoes are displayed as dots, the brightness
of which is proportional to their amplitude
 real-time B-mode ultrasound is a dynamic imaging system where information
is continually updated and displayed on a monitor
ultrasound is attenuated within tissues and attenuation is related to wavelength
of the sound, the density of the tissue, the heterogenicity of the tissue and the
number and type of echo interfaces
 bright (specular) echoes are produced when a large proportion of the beam is
reflected back to the transducer; these echoes are displayed as white areas on
the ultrasound machine screen
 no echoes are produced when the sound is transmitted and not reflected; these
areas are displayed as black on the ultrasound machine screen
non-specular echoes are produced when the beam encounters a structure similar
to one wavelength in size, and these echoes appear as varying shades of grey
on the ultrasound machine screen
Clinical Examination of the Female
53
The ultrasound transducer
 piezoelectric crystals are arranged together to form an ultrasound transducer,
contained within the ultrasound head
transducers produce sound of a characteristic frequency:
[a}]
 high frequencies allow good resolution although there is greater attenua-
tion of the sound beam in tissues
[b}
low frequencies allow a greater depth of penetration (less attenuation) but
with reduced resolution
Equipment for examination of the bitch
sector or micro-convex transducers are most suited to transabdominal imaging
for the examination of the ovaries and of early pregnancy a 7.5 MHz transducer
is most suitable
 for the examination of later pregnancy a 5.0MHz transducer is necessary
 a 5.0MHz transducer offers a compromise which gives a reasonable depth of
penetration combined with adequate tissue resolution
the ultrasound machine should have a keyboard to allow identification of the
animal and possess electronic callipers to allow measurement of images
 there should be facilities to record the images and this can be achieved using:
(a)  a thermal printer
(b) digital frame recording
Ultrasound terminology
tissues that markedly reflect sound (such as gas, bone and metal) appear white
on the ultrasound screen and are called echogenic
 tissues that transmit sound (such as fluid) appear black on the ultrasound screen
and are called anechogenic (or anechoic)
 tissues that allow some transmission and some reflection (such as most soft
 tissues) appear as varying shades of grey and are called hypoechogenic or hyper-
echogenic depending upon their exact appearance
strictly, a hyperechogenic tissue produces a hyperechoic region within the
image, although these terms are often used synonymously
Examination of the bitch
 clipping the hair of the ventral abdomen is required for examination of the
uterine body and horns
 a  n s     o  a y s
 in many patients imaging is most conveniently performed with the bitch in the
standing position
the skin should be cleaned of debris and normally alcohol is applied which
helps to remove debris and increase the contact of the ultrasound gel

Figure 5.3 Uterine body of a bitch during oestrus: (a) longitudinal ultrasound image, the
uterus lies dorsal to the anechoic bladder (ventral in this image since the bitch was in the
standing position with the transducer adjacent to the ventral abdominal wall), and has a
appearance and the hypo- and hyperechoic ayers can be easily identified (5.0MHz
transducer, scale in centimetres),
The normal non-pregnant uterus
 lies dorsal to the bladder, but its position may be variable depending upon:
[a]
the extent of bladder flling
[b]
the size of the uterus
[c]
the stage of the reproductive cycle
 the uterine body of the pre-pubertal and non-pregnant bitch during anoestrus
may be less than 1 cm in transverse diameter
the uterus may be identified dorsal or dorso-lateral to the bladder and can be
shown to be tubular by imaging in two perpendicular planes (Figure 5.3)
the uterus may be more readily imaged in older multiparous bitches
in older bitches the bifurcation and distal uterine horns can be detected in
approximately 40% of cases
the uterine body and horns are composed of two distinct layers (Figure 5.3):
[a]
 a central homogenous relatively hypoechoic region (endometrium)
b]
 a peripheral hyperechoic layer (serosa)
 in the author's laboratory we have described the detail of the ultrasonographic
appearance of the uterus throughout the oestrous cycle [4]
during oestrus the uterus becomes increasingly hypoechoic and develops central
radiating hyperechoic lines
the changes in uterine echotexture are associated with an increase in uterine
diameter
 the changes in uterine echogenicity and size are not suffciently specific to allow
the anticipation of ovulation time
the echotexture returns to a homogenous nature during metoestrus
(dioestrus)
uterine transverse section diameter continues to increase during early
metoestrus
 uterine diameter increases in both pregnant and non-pregnant bitches

[+]  nao ouou al
some of the first reports on the ultrasonographic appearance of follicles and
corpora lutea were published from the author's laboratory [5,6]
ovaries are difficult to examine due to their small size and superficial
location
 jo aod pepneo au oi saneipe paeoo ane sarao aun snsaoue su
kidney close to the lateral abdominal wall
during oestrus the ovaries are often located more caudally and ventrally
during anoestrus the ovaries of the bitch are less than 1.5 × 1.0 x 0.8cm in
size, and are relatively homogenous
at the onset of pro-oestrus small fluid-filled anechoic follicles may be detected
within the ovarian stroma
when first imaged the internal diameter of follicles is between 1 and 2mm
follicles enlarge during pro-oestrus and become less spherical in outline
the maximum follicular diameter is usually attained 1 day after the surge of
plasma LH, i.e. the day before ovulation
anechoic follicles are replaced by hypoechoic structures (presumably early
corpora lutea) between 1 and 3 days after the surge of plasma LH; however,
 these structures are present only transiently, before being replaced by anechoic
structures with 2mm thick hypoechoic walls
luteal structures are most commonly cavitated during early metoestrus
(dioestrus)
the time of ovulation is difficult to demonstrate without repeated examination
of the bitch but in work from the author's clinic detailed descriptions of follicu-
lar dynamics and appearance of the corpora lutea was published [7]
the detection of ovulation with ultrasound has limited value, especially when
compared with more simple techniques such as vaginal cytology and measure-
ment of plasma progesterone concentration (Figure 5.4); however recent

understanding of follicle dynamics and documentation of abnormal ovarian
function with ultrasound [7] will undoubtedly lead to improved clinical prac-
tice in the future
5.9
MEASUREMENT OF PLASMA HORMONES
(see Figure 4.1)
 measurement of the plasma concentrations of the steroid hormones may be
useful for estimating the stage of the oestrous cycle
conventionally hormone concentrations are measured by radioimmunoassay
[8]; however
[a]
these are often costly
[b]
samples are often only assayed in batches
[c]
there is often a delay in receiving the results
hormone concentrations may be accurately
y measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques:
[a]
 these can be performed in the practice laboratory
[b] 
results can usually be obtained within 1 hour of sample collection
 in the UK both quantative and qualitative ELISA methods are available for the
assessment of progesterone concentration:
a]
quantitative techniques require the use of a plate reader and plotting of
a standard curve for known progesterone standards
b)
qualitative techniques allow the estimation of progesterone concentra-
d     e   q o
standards
 we have documented the technical and financial perspectives relating to these
methods [9]; this is important and this type of work will affect utilization of
techniques in clinical practice
Plasma (serum) progesterone concentration (Figure 5.5)
 progesterone is produced solely by the pre-ovulatory follicle and the corpus
luteum in the bitch
 progesterone concentrations increase immediately before ovulation
 progesterone concentrations peak approximately 10-15 days after ovulation
serial monitoring of plasma progesterone therefore allows:
[a]
 anticipation of ovulation
[b]
confrmation of ovulation
[c]
detection of the fertilization period (see Chapter 11)
[d]
the likely time of onset of parturition
 values decrease slowly throughout the luteal phase

 progesterone concentrations are similar in pregnancy and non-pregnancy (non-
 pregnant values are lower, but because of individual variation values cannot
be used to diagnose pregnancy or non-pregnancy)
 the non-pregnant luteal phase lasts approximately 68 days from ovulation
the pregnant luteal phase lasts approximately 63 days from ovulation
there is a sudden decrease in progesterone 24-36 hours before parturition
NB: It is feasible to run ELISA on whole blood and vaginal fluid which removes
the need for centrifugation of the sample and therefore increases its practical
application in some clinical situations [10,11].

Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Plasma (serum) oestrogen concentration
oestrogen concentrations during the majority of anoestrus are low
 concentrations increase in late anoestrus and throughout pro-oestrus
 peak values are reached during late pro-oestrus or early oestrus, approximately
2 days before the LH surge
concentrations are low at the time of ovulation
dn hdp ao o r aq a  s p son
when a sample is taken in relation to ovulation
 oestrogen concentrations increase during the late non-pregnant and late preg-
nant luteal phase
 measurement of resting plasma oestrogen concentration has little clinical indi-
cation in the female
Plasma (serum) luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration
concentrations of LH increase from 1 month before ovulation
there is a large pre-ovulatory LH surge (values increase by 20 to 40 times)
which appears to be the trigger for ovulation [12]
 the pre-ovulatory surge occurs approximately 1-2 days after peak values of
oestrogen are reached
the pre-ovulatory surge lasts 24-72 hours
serial sampling and the detection of the LH surge therefore allows:
[a]
anticipation of ovulation
[b]
 detection of the fertilization period (see Chapter 11)
 LH is, however, only reliably measured by radioimmunoassay at present
 LH is luteotrophic and is elevated similarly in the pregnant and non-pregnant 
luteal phase
 LH concentrations are very high in neutered animals and can be used to dem-
onstrate absence of gonads if such assays are readily available
5.10 BACTERIAL EXAMINATION OF THE FEMALE
REPRODUCTIVE TRACT
Normal bacterial colonization
Vestibule and caudal vagina
 these have a normal bacterial flora
this changes daily
 many species of bacteria are present, including haemolytic streptococci, other
streptococci, staphylococci, Escherichia coli and many others 
ureoplasmata and mycoplasmata are also normal
there is usually a mixed flora, with two to five species present
Clinical Examination of the Female
59
the prevalence of anaerobic bacteria is not well documented but these are
certainly frequently isolated when attempts are made
 Pseudomonas spp. are not commonly isolated from normal bitches
 there is no correlation between the numbers of organisms cultured and those
seen in vaginal smears; this suggests that some stained bacteria may be dead
or are anaerobes
Cranial vagina
 there is little information on the flora of the cranial vagina and cervix
vagino-cervical defence mechanisms, i.e. mucus production with discharge to
the vulva and neutrophil mobilization, may normally discourage bacterial colo-
nization of the cranial vagina
Uterus
the uterus is usually thought to be bacteriologically sterile except in oestrus or
after parturition when the cervix opens
however:
[a]
 one study has isolated organisms from apparently normal uteri at other
stages of the cycle
[b]
 it is inevitable that vaginal flora will be introduced into the uterus with
the ejaculate during coitus and
to be capable of contributing to the disease process 
it is possible to collect samples from the uterus using endoscopic techniques;
however these are liable to contamination from the cranial vagina and results
should be interpreted cautiously
Interpretation of vaginal bacteriology
most swab samples are taken from the vestibule
they should therefore be expected to contain bacteria
there is no evidence that colonization of the caudal vagina and vestibule by
bacteria is a sign of disease
there is no evidence of coital influence on the vestibular bacterial flora
withholding mating because of isolation of β-haemolytic streptococci from the
vestibule seems unnecessary
consideration should be given to the probability that the dog has a resident
penile flora (see 17.2) which may be enhanced by contact between the penis
and the bitch's coat, anus, etc, before intromission
the isolation of a single species of bacterium (pure culture) from the tract may
be more significant than a mixed culture
60
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
venereal spread of organisms other than bacteria is possible, but has not been
confirmed
much more research is necessary before the possible role of bacteria in bitch
infertility can be elucidated
 the only known bacterial venereal pathogen in the dog is Brucella canis
 routine bacteriological screening in the clinically normal bitch is pointless
5.11 CYTOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SUSPECTED
PATHOLOGICAL MATERIAL
cytological examination may be useful for determining the cause of abnormal
discharges, swellings and masses
fine-needle aspirates, *grab' biopsies collected endoscopically and excised mate-
rial may be useful
typical features of inflammatory disease include increased numbers of polymor
phonuclear neutrophils and bacteria where these are involved
typical features of neoplasia are specific to the lesion, for example:
a]
 vaginal leiomyomas have typical elongate spindle cells with cigar-shaped
nuclei
[b]
transmissible venereal tumours (in countries where this is present) have
round cells with eccentrically located nuclei and coarsely stippled
chromatin
[c]
ovarian germ cell tumours contain round cells with nuclei containing
finely stippled chromatin in the nuclei and a lightly basophilic
cytoplasm
5.12 ENDOCRINOLOGICAL STIMULATION TESTS
 measurement of basal hormone concentrations is not always diagnostic
hormone stimulation tests may be useful to confirm the presence of a functional
pituitary - ovarian interaction (the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
stimulation test)
hormone stimulation tests may be useful to confirm the presence of functional
ovarian tissue (the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation test)
The gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test
(Figure 5.6)

5.13 LAPAROSCOPY AND LAPAROTOMY
laparoscopy and laparotomy are not widely performed for the investigation of
reproductive tract disease
both techniques may be useful when other diagnostic tools have failed
these techniques enable abnormalities of the tubular genital tract to be diag-
nosed and for cytological specimens to be collected where appropriate
5.14KARYOTYPING
this is establishing the number and appearance of chromosomes
may be useful in certain cases of infertility especially animals with ambiguous
genitalia or bitches that never demonstrate cyclical activity
there are a limited number of institutions offering this service
requires collection of blood into an EDTA anticoagulant and then rapid trans-
port to the laboratory
chromosomes are examined from metaphase spreads following culture
the most common abnormalities seen in the bitch where there is a phenotypic
female appearance are XO syndrome and XX sex reversal

Anatomy of the Male
Understanding of the normal anatomy of the male reproductive tract is important
to facilitate examination of the male for normality and to determine changes from
 normal which may result in disease; it is also helpful in some cases for determining
the prognosis for fertility.
6.1.
PREPUCE (SHEATH)
completely covers the non-erect penis
the outside is covered by skin
 the inside is a mucous membrane which is continuous with the mucosa of the
penis at the base of the glans penis
 occasionally the prepuce is short in length in comparison to the penis which
results in a protrusion of the penis
6.2
PENIS
 the glans penis starts at the attachment to the inner lining of the prepuce and
is composed of:
(a}t
 the proximal bulbus glandis - in the non-erect state this is hardly discern-
ible; when the penis is erect the bulbus glandis becomes a roughly spheri-
cal swelling which is responsible for locking the penis into the bitch's
vagina during coitus (see 9.4)
[b]
 the pars longa glandis comprises the distal three-quarters of the glans and
terminates in the opening of the urethra
 the os penis is a bone which is surrounded by the glans penis; it is broad
 proximally and narrower distally and has a ventral groove which houses the
urethra

TESTES (Figure 6.1)
male dogs are born with testes within the abdomen
testes generally pass through the inguinal canal 4 days after birth
the scrotal location is normally reached by 4-6 weeks after birth and usually
earlier
i sn a yo sixe n an m ades  Pino n ae i
longitudinally
the bulk of the testis is composed of seminiferous tubules, in which spermato-
ids go ssard a Aq pd are co
the seminiferous tubules are supported by a network of fibrous tissue called
the mediastinum testis
the seminiferous tubules empty into a collecting system, the rete testis, which
conducts spermatozoa away from the testis and into the epididymis
normal testes have a firm texture upon palpation; changes in texture, either
local or generalized, softening or hardening, usually indicate disease
there is a good relation between testicular volume and total sperm output; data
from the author's clinic has established normal ranges that are now widely used
in clinical practice [1]
epididymis, spermatic artery and vein (S) and ductus deferens (D). The tail of the epididymis
is attached to the tunica vaginalis propria (V) by the ligament of the tail of the epididymis.
66
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
6.4 EPIDIDYMIS
this is a very long tube which is coiled tightly onto itself to form a structure
which can be described as having a head, body and tail
 the head (caput) of the epididymis is on the cranio-lateral border of the testis
and is not readily palpable
 the body (corpus) of the epididymis is on the dorso-lateral surface of the testis
and cannot be palpated
the tail (cauda) of the epididymis is on the dorso-caudal pole of the testis; it is
readily palpable in the normal animal as a firm *pea-sized protuberance which
does not appear to be contiguous with the body
 the epididymis now continues as a straight tube which contains mature sper-
matozoa and is called the ductus (vas) deferens
during their passage through the epididymis spermatozoa become mature; in
the dog this takes about 14 days
 in dogs with an absence of sperm production the tail of the epididymis may be
smaller than the normal size and have a flaccid texture upon palpation
6.5
DUCTUS DEFERENS (VAS DEFERENS)
this duct conveys spermatozoa from the epididymis to the urethra
it runs into the abdomen in the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal
within the abdomen it passes cranial to the ureter and then empties into the
urethra in the cranial prostate gland
 the ducti (vasa) deferentia are approximately 1-2mm in diameter, pale col-
oured and have a firm texture - they are good landmarks for locating abdomi-
nal testes during surgery
6.6
SPERMATIC CORD
this is a bundle of various tissues which runs between the testis and the abdomi-
nal wall
it has four main components:
[a]
the ductus deferens
[b]
the cremaster muscle: this arises from the internal abdominal oblique
muscle near the external inguinal ring and is attached to the vaginal tunic
at the level of the testis; it can vary the distance between the testis and
abdominal wall, thus regulating testis temperature
c]
the spermatic (testicular) artery: this conveys blood from the aorta to the
testis and runs through the pampiniform plexus
[d]
a i sn a o o sinu s aa (ri os a
vena cava; in the spermatic cord the vein divides into a complex of small
veins (the pampiniform plexus) which surrounds the spermatic artery. The
cool blood returning from the testicle reduces the temperature of the arte-
rial blood to ensure that the testis does not become overheated
Anatomy of the Male
67
NB: A special muscle in the scrotal skin, the dartos, can also regulate the proxim-
ity of the testes to the body wall and thus influence their temperature.
6.7
INGUINAL CANAL
the spermatic vessels and the ductus deferens pass into the abdomen through
a narrow space in the muscles of the abdominal wall - the inguinal canal
 occasionally this canal is wide enough to allow the escape of some abdominal
contents to form an inguinal hernia; this may also happen in the bitch (see
21.7)
 close to the inguinal canal is the inguinal lymph node that may become enlarged
when there is testicular pathology
6.8
PROSTATE GLAND

 it is a bi-lobed structure situated at the pelvic inlet (Figure 6.2)

the urethra passes through the gland before it reaches the base of the penis
the ducti (vasa) deferentia also pass through a small amount of the cranial
aspect of the gland before they enter the urethra dorsally
 the prostate gland produces a clear secretion which is expelled into the urethra
studies in the author's laboratory have confirmed that the prostate gland con-
tributes the first and third fractions of the ejaculate [2]
prostatic fluid is bacteriocidal
the position and size of the gland are very variable
the gland normally increases in size with advancing age; increase in size is
usually accompanied by a more abdominal position

 a range of diagnostic tests can be used to differentiate normal from abnormal
prostate (see 17.7)
6.9
URETHRA
 this tube has the function of conveying both urine and semen to the tip of the
penis
 it originates at the bladder neck and travels caudally on the floor of the pelvis
through the prostate gland; here the ducti deferentia open into its dorsal surface
at the caudal limit of the ischium the urethra enters the penis and runs on its
caudo-ventral aspect eventually entering the ventral groove of the os penis
coordinated muscular activity is required for the forceful emission of semen

Physiology of the Male
There is complex regulation of reproductive physiology, with a close association
between the hormonal environment and the reproductive organs. This is necessary
to provide suitable male behaviour and sperm production.
SPERMATOGENESIS
this is the complicated process by which spermatozoa are produced, and it
occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testes
cells called spermatogonia, the precursors of spermatozoa, divide in the usual
manner (mitosis) to produce very many spermatocytes
 spermatocytes then divide by meiosis in which the normal number of chromo-
somes in the resulting cells is halved to 39 and the genetic material derived
from the individual's parents is mixed
 the resulting cells are called spermatids and are described as being haploid (half
the usual number of chromosomes - cells with 78 chromosomes are said to be
diploid; this includes the two sex chromosomes)
spermatids change into spermatozoa by a complex rearrangement of organelles;
basically the nucleus becomes the sperm head, the Golgi apparatus forms the
acrosome, and the mitochondria and centrioles are involved in the development
of the mid piece and tail (see 10.5)
 most of the cytoplasm is left in the Sertoli cells which are situated on the base-
ment membrane of the seminiferous tubule; they regulate the metamorphosis
from spermatid to spermatozoon
 some components of the cytoplasma remain attached to sperm as ‘residual
bodies’ - these are frequently seen in (immature) ejaculated spermatozoa as
distal cytoplasmic droplets; proximal cytoplasmic droplets are less commonly
seen and represent very immature sperm that are incapable of fertilization
spermatogenesis commences at approximately 4 months of age but spermato-
zoa do not appear in the ejaculate until 10-12 months on average

TEMPERATURE CONTROL
the mechanisms which keep the dog's testes cooler than the rest of the body
have been mentioned in Chapter 6 and are:
[a]
the testes are housed outside the body in the scrotal sac
[b]
the cremaster muscle can influence the distance between the body and
testis
[c]
the dartos muscle in the scrotal wall can influence the size of the scrotum
and thus the position of the testes
[P
the arrangement of the blood vessels in the spermatic cord allows cooling
of arterial blood by the venous return in the pampiniform plexus (see 6.6)
 conditions which cause elevated body temperature, e.g. fever and heat stroke,
may not be compensated for by these mechanisms and can impair spermatogen-
esis (sometimes on a permanent basis)
 obesity may also reduce testicular cooling
7.3
SPERMATOZOAL TRANSPORT
seminiferous tubules are U'-shaped and along the tubule all the different stages
of spermatogenesis are represented; sperm are therefore continually released
into the lumen (this would not be the case if all areas of the tubule had sper-
matogenesis occurring at the same stage of development)
luminal sperm enter collecting ducts and then enter the caput of the
epididymis
spermatozoa entering the epididymis are in an immature state; they have a
droplet of residual cytoplasm at the neck called a proximal cytoplasmic drop
(see 10.5) which is sometimes incorrectly called the ^protoplasmic’ droplet
during the passage of spermatozoa along the convoluted epididymis, which is
 presumably caused by the constant production of more spermatozoa from the
testis, the cells mature
on entry into the ductus deferens (the epididymal transit time is 14 days in the
dog) the cytoplasmic droplet has moved to the distal end of the mid piece or
become detached from the spermatozoon, which is now considered to be
mature
 factors which might influence the speed of movement along the ductus deferens
are unknown
ida au yo p aun m pars aq oi pris a are ads
in the normal dog the pea-sized tail is normally turgid and quite plump upon
 palpation but small and flaccid where sperm production is low
spermatozoa which are not voided by ejaculation are thought to be forced to
the opening of the ductus deferens and into the urethra by the build-up of cells
 behind them; they may then travel cranially to the bladder and are expelled in
urine
Physiology of the Male
71
during ejaculation spermatozoa are actively expelled from the ductus deferens
into the urethra
there is little evidence to support the concept that the ejaculate from an infre-
quently ^used’ stud dog will contain an abnormally high number of abnormal
spermatozoa
 the spermatogenic cycle, i.e. from division of spermatogonia to the appearance
of spermatozoa in the ejaculate, takes 8 weeks; for 2 of these weeks the sper-
matozoa are maturing in the epididymis
7.4 PROSTATE GLAND
 produces the first and third fractions of the dog's ejaculate (see 10.5) [2]
the function of the first fraction is probably to flush the urethra clear of any
urine or cellular debris
incubation of second rich fraction with first fraction in a water bath is detri-
mental to sperm; in normal mating the first fraction is expelled during play
before intromission and therefore does not enter the bitch
the function of the third fraction of the ejaculate is probably to wash the sperm-
rich second fraction from the cranial vagina into the uterus of the bitch
disease of the prostate (17.7) may affect fertility because:
[a]
blood can affect spermatozoal viability in some cases but this is unlikely
in dogs
[b]
sperm often stick to polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and there-
fore do not progress in the female tract
[c]
the effect of bacterial prostatic infection (and subsequent changes in the
 nature of the prostatic fluid) on spermatozoal function is unknown 
d]
drugs used to reduce prostatic size (progestogens; gonadotrophin releasing-
hormone agonists) may also inhibit spermatogenesis (see 27.1 and 27.5);
other drugs such as alpha-reductase inhibitors (which essentially are anti-
androgenic [see 27.11]) reduce the volume of prostatic fluid ejaculated
resulting is a small volume but concentrated ejaculate
 surprisingly, spermatozoa incubated in vitro in prostatic fuid are less viable
than those incubated in semen extenders; it seems therefore that prostatic fluid
per se is not supportive of spermatozoal function
 prostatic fluid is probably important for preventing the attachment of sperm
 to PMNs and for modifying specific components of the uterine inflammatory
response to mating
7.5
ERECTION
factors which stimulate erection in most animals are pheromones, the smell of
a female in oestrus and the association between routine and coitus
the pathways by which these stimuli initiate erection are probably neural, but
are not completely understood
72
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
erection is tumescence (swelling and turgidity) of the penis due to an accumula-
tion of blood in its tissues caused by constriction of venous return
 in dogs only slight erection occurs before coitus; intromission is facilitated by
the rigidity afforded by the os penis
during full erection there is substantial swelling of the bulbus glandis which
results in the penis becoming “locked’ into the female genital tract (see 9.4)
 it is only after the erection has subsided that the dog and bitch can subsequently
part
7.6 EJACULATION
contractions of the urethral muscle force fluids from the ducti deferentia and
prostate gland into and along the urethra
there are three distinct fractions of the ejaculate that can be identified
First fraction
during initial sexual excitement the first fraction of the ejaculate is voided
this varies in volume but is usually approximately 0.5-2.0ml
this fraction may also be ejaculated while the dog is thrusting during attempts
 to introduce his penis into the bitch's vagina, but is not usually voided during
intromission
work in the author's laboratory demonstrated that this fraction originates from
the prostate gland and may have the function of washing the urethra clear of
urine [2]
Second fraction
the second fraction is usually ejaculated after intromission when thrusting
ceases
 this is the sperm-rich portion of the ejaculate and is usually 0.5-1.0ml in
volume
 u l a o ndp s e eap p a  so 
the vagina during completion of the dog's erection
 during and soon after ejaculation of this fraction, the dog instinctively wants
to “turn’ (see 9.4)
Third fraction
 the third fraction originates from the prostate gland
 it is usually voided whilst the dog and the bitch are standing tail to tail in the
tie' position (Figure 7.1)
Physiology of the Male
73
Figure 7.1 Ejaculation of the third (prostatic) fraction of the ejaculate occurs during
the “tie'.
 the volume of prostatic fluid ejaculated may approach 15-20 ml in large breeds
and is probably related to the length of the 'tie'
the function of this fraction is thought to be that of washing the spermatozoa
forward into the uterus; however, the effect of third fraction on spermatozoa
may not always be favourable (see 7.4)
termination of ejaculation is followed by detumescence of the penis and its
withdrawal
 normally after ejaculation the dog licks his penis until it returns to its position
within the prepuce
7.7  SPERM TRANSPORT IN THE BITCH
 in the bitch the male accessory gland secretions have critical importance
we have shown that the bitch has a uterine inflammatory response to sperm
u e aeu P sisd pue rsd ps yoq inq sod
effect on this, most likely mediated by a reduction in neutrophil binding to
sperm [3]

Endocrinology of the
Male
The same hormonal axis is present in the male dog as seen in the bitch, i.e. secre-
  us  d a ss sy a  u
pituitary gland stimulates the testes (Figure 8.1) [1].
8.1
GONADOTROPHIN-RELEASING HORMONE (GnRH)
 produced in the hypothalamus (at the base of the brain) and conveyed to the
anterior pituitary gland via a specialized system of blood vessels
responsible for selectively causing release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland
secretion is episodic
pulsatile secretion rather than continuous secretion is necessary for the induc-
tion and maintenance of normal gonadotrophin release
8.2 FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (FSH)
 FSH release is slow and gradual after GnRH stimulation
FSH binds to Sertoli cells and spermatogonia
binding results in the production of a variety of proteins that may be important
in regulating spermatogenesis via androgen binding protein and transferrin
feedback control of FSH is via the gonadal peptide inhibin, and possibly modu-
lation of Leydig cell function
8.3 LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH) (ALSO CALLED
INTERSTITIAL CELL STIMULATING HORMONE (ICSH))
 LH release is immediate but transient after GnRH stimulation

LH binds to Leydig cells of the testis

minutes
8.4
ANDROGENS (TESTOSTERONE AND
DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE)
produced by cells in the testis which form little islands between the seminifer-
ous tubules; these are interstitial cells or Leydig cells
testosterone secretion occurs both locally within the testis and into the periph-
eral circulation
 most testosterone secreted into the plasma is bound to plasma proteins
peripheral testosterone is necessary for the development and maintenance of
secondary sexual characteristics, maintenance of sexual behaviour and negative
feedback regulation of gonadotrophin secretion
high intra-testicular testosterone concentrations are maintained within the sem-
 iniferous tubules by binding to androgen binding protein (ABP)
76
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
high local testosterone concentrations are important for the initiation and
maintenance of spermatogenesis
testosterone and its active metabolites oestradiol and dihydrotestosterone exert
a profound feedback effect on FSH and LH
 ectopic testes (e.g. in cryptorchid dogs; see 17.3) still produce androgens and
have male physical characteristics and behaviours
in mature dogs plasma testosterone concentrations vary between 0.5 and
5.0 ng/ml; there is a great deal of variation throughout the day in an individual
dog, so that assay of a single sample is of little value [2]
in castrated dogs, values are consistently below 200 pg/ml
ny e ssan sidoisa paguapiun ue jo anuasad au asouep on rapno !
chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation test can be performed (see 10.15);
a rise in testosterone concentration after administration of hCG indicates the
presence of testicular tissue [2]
8.5 INHIBIN
 this is a hormone produced by the Sertoli cells of the testis which inhibits the
release of FSH
 its physiology in the dog has not been proven but it is assumed based on infor-
mation in other species
8.6
ACTIVINS AND INHIBINS
there is increasing evidence that the Sertoli cells produce other substances,
termed activins that have a stimulatory effect upon FSH secretion

Normal Mating
9.1 PLANNING THE MATING
 critical for planning a mating is appropriate research and planning ahead
 selection of which animals to breed is a complicated art and much is detailed
in sections 1.5 and 1.6
 before breeding it is important to consider whether there are adequate time
and finances to support the bitch especially if something should go wrong and
for example a caesarean operation is needed
recognizing whether there is an appropriate market for the pups that will be
produced is essential
there is no physiological or medical reason why a bitch must have a litter of
pups; indeed it may be in the best interest of the individual for her to be
neutered
 breeders may be required to have a license for this purpose (for example in the
UK the Breeding of Dogs Act 1973 legislates about licensing and governs the
conditions under which animals should be managed and how frequently they
can be bred)
 when breeding involves animals owned by different people it is best to use a
breeding contract which should contain details of the stud fee, whether it is
payable if the bitch does not conceive, whether the bitch has a free return if
she does not conceive and whether the stud dog owner has the ‘pick' of the
litter of pups
· the help of an experienced dog breeder should be sought if the bitch and dog
owner are novices
 inform the dog owner when the first signs of pro-oestrus are noted in the bitch
9.2TIMING
 most bitches are mated 10-12 days after the beginning of pro-oestrus 
 this usually gives satisfactory results even if the bitch is not ovulating at this
time because:
[a}
 sperm from a fertile dog can survive for up to 7 days in the bitch, so that
mating before ovulation can be fertile
Dog Breeding, Whetping and Puppy Care, First Edition. Gary C.W. England.
① 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
78
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
[b]
0ocytes are not ready to be fertilized until 2 days after ovulation, so that
mating after ovulation may be fertile (see 11.3)
however, an inappropriate mating time is the most common cause of alleged
infertility in the bitch (see 11.1)
repeated mating 24-48 hours apart increases the likelihood of conception
help in detecting ovulation time may be required when:
[a}] 
(' as a  r r ra  ao s
[b]
artificial insemination is being used (see 27.1)
[c]
a dog with poor semen quality is being used; repeated mating may still
be advantageous (see 17.3)
(d) a bitch is 'shy’ and may need to be restrained during mating
 ovulation time can be detected using vaginal endoscopy, vaginal cytology, or
by measuring blood progesterone concentrations (see 11.3)
9.3
PREPARATION FOR MATING
 the appropriate stud to be used should be identified long before the onset
of pro-oestrus to enable careful checking of health status information (hip
scores etc.)
vaccination and disease status of individual and the kennel to be visited should
be examined
despite what is expected by many breeders there is no point in routine bacte-
riological screening of the male or female unless in a country where Brucella
canis is important
 it is common practice for the female to visit the male
immediately before mating it is helpful to clip long hair from around the vulva;
the vulva may also be cleaned with water to reduce bacterial contamination
which may be flushed into the uterus at the time of mating
 the bitch should be encouraged to urinate before being introduced to the dog
 both dog and bitch should be restrained using a long lead for control, but
allowing play including mounting before intromission
 oil-based lubricants are placed on the vulval lips by some breeders especially
when inexperienced animals are mated; whilst not necessary these are helpful
NB: Oil-based lubricants are preferable to water-based lubricants which can mix
with the sperm and have a toxic effect.
9.4
NORMAL COITAL BEHAVIOUR
Foreplay
 if dog and bitch are unrestrained a variable amount of sniffing, jumping and
playing occurs, during which time the dog, particularly if he is inexperienced,
will mount the bitch in various inappropriate positions
Normal Mating
79
 during this time first fraction may be ejaculated
if the bitch is cooperative she will eventually stand still to allow the dog to
mount her from behind, and she will raise her tail to one side and lift her vulva
to facilitate intromission
 some bitches may need to be held by the head and be muzzled in order to
prevent the risk of the dogs biting each other, or an aggressive bitch frightening
Intromission
 once the dog has mounted he will commence thrusting movements in order to
 try to achieve intromission; at this time erection is only slight and rigidity is
afforded by the os penis (see 6.2)
the fore limbs of the dog grip the bitch tightly in front of her pelvis
· on gaining intromission more purposeful thrusts ensure that the whole glans
penis is inserted; the dog's pelvis is forced very close to the bitch at this stage,
and his lower back is almost vertical
 erection starts after full intromission, and the dog ejaculates the second, sperm-
rich fraction at this time
The ‘tie'
once full erection has occurred the dog instinctively wants to dismount
by placing both front feet to one side of the bitch, the back leg on the opposite
side is left in the air
 the dog lifts this leg over the bitch's back whilst turning round
this causes the penis, proximal to the os penis, to bend laterally through 180
degrees
· if the dog has a full erection, his penis will not leave the bitch's vagina
this twisting is not painful and probably functions to maintain blood within
the penis and prolong the ejection and lengthen the time of ejaculation
· ejaculation of the third fraction continues, even though the urethra is bent
NB: In some breeds, e.g. greyhounds, a complete turn is not usually allowed by
the handler; this does not seem to affect fertility, but is an inappropriate
strategy.
Practical management of breeding
the dog must be able to enter the bitch as straight as possible and this could
be difficult if he is too short or too tall; a step or sloped surface can be used
for either the dog or bitch to address size differences
80
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 sometimes the dog will not breed because he has had an unpleasant past experi-
ence that has resulted in a loss of confidence, often causing a failure to achieve
a full erection; holding the dog and bitch together as soon as thrusting has
stopped may be helpful
a dog should not be allowed to mate the bitch too many times without achiev.
ing a tie; it is better to try a few times and then rest the dog until the next day
 often the bitch's position can be a problem: she may not elevate her vulva cor-
rectly, she may not deviate her tail very well, or she may keep moving her tail
from side to side; in these instances elevating the bitch's vulva to the correct
 position or holding her tail out of the way can help the dog
 maiden bitches (bitches that have not been mated before) can be a little over-
whelmed by the whole process and require much more support than an expe-
rienced bitch; they will often stand at first but then change their minds. In these
cases patience and gentle encouragement is needed; sometimes these matings
take several hours to achieve
 some bitches can be difficult if the stud dog is playing too much and leaping
on the bitch; inexperienced dogs exhibit this type of behaviour. The problem
is rectified by gentle restraint of the bitch, ensuring that the human presence
does not upset the stud
whenever possible an inexperienced stud dog should be put with an experi-
enced bitch, and a new bitch with an experienced stud
9.5 FACTORS PREVENTING NORMAL MATING
(see 20.6 and Chapter 24)
Psychological factors
 Most dogs know instinctively how to copulate but on occasion may not be
able to because of:
(a)  a difference in sexual experience; an experienced stud may frighten a
virgin bitch or vice versa
b)
fear of human disapproval; this is particularly true of male dogs which
 pxas d r dn aq rd a
[c)
unfamiliarity with the venue; because the dog takes the more active role
in coitus the bitch is usually taken to the dog's residence in order to avoid
this problem
[d]
 overfamiliarity; sometimes dogs and bitches kept together all the time will 
not copulate
[e]
humanization: particularly bitches, when kept in houses and rarely
exposed to other dogs, appear to resent the approach of another dog as
if it were ‘abnormal
-uu Aisnod aui on res aq A su siop aeu u op jo y
tioned problem in the bitch. The cause could also be some of the other
aforementioned psychological factors
Normal Mating
81
diagnosis and therapy are difficult:
[a]
measurement of circulating testosterone concentrations is not diagnostic
because of the large variation throughout the day in the normal dog
[b]
 administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) may increase
testosterone production but is not therapeutic
administration of testosterone is also not therapeutic and may cause
pituitary gonadotrophins)
[p
thyroid replacement therapy may improve libido but such regimes have
not been properly evaluated
Physical factors
dogs with obvious limb deformities and musculo-skeletal lesions may have
problems achieving a position compatible with intromission; they should not
be used for breeding if their condition is inherited
 subtle lumbar or lumbo-sacral lesions may prevent dogs from mating, even
though there is no evidence of pain in other everyday activities
 bitches may require help to hold up heavy dogs
dogs with prostatic disease may show signs of pain during or after ejaculation
(see 17.7}
 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce musculo-skeletal pain and
are not known to be detrimental to semen
NB: It may be difficult to ascertain whether a dog's reluctance to copulate is due
to physical or psychological factors.
Failure to tie
 after intromission the tie may not occur due to both dog and bitch factors
(commonly size difference)
if ejaculation of the second fraction has occurred, the bitch may still conceive,
although fertility is not thought to be good presumably because of the absence
of flushing sperm forward within the vagina into the uterus
 in the author's laboratory we have documented the critical effect that dog
auoda Au an q au o ui siu pi oisd
to mating [1,2]; failure to tie may also result in lower fertility since prostatic
fuid is not present to ameliorate the uterine inflammatory response to
sperm
the effect of the length of the tie on fertility is not known, although many
breeders feel that a long tie enhances the chance of conception
where the dog persistently separates quickly some breeders will attempt holding
the male and female together; the efficacy of this is unknown
82

CERTIFICATE OF MATING
 in some countries it is necessary to for the dog and bitch owner to jointly certify
that natural mating occurred; specific nationally approved certificates are avail-
able for this purpose
 in other countries certification is only required at the time of registration of
the pups

Clinical Examination of
the Male
A careful clinical examination of the male can be helpful to document normality
and in some cases the diagnosis and prognosis of a problem.
10.1 BASIC EXAMINATION OF THE REPRODUCTIVE
TRACT
This consists of:
visual examination of the prepuce and penis
palpation of the scrotum
semen collection and evaluation
(measurement of alkaline phosphatase concentrations in semen)
real-time ultrasonographic imaging
 measurement of plasma hormone concentrations
observation of mating behaviour
10.2
ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES THAT MAY BE
CONSIDERED
These include:
bacterial examination of the reproductive tract
testicular biopsy
testicular fine-needle aspiration
 prostatic biopsy
 prostatic massage/urethral flushing
endocrinological stimulation tests
karyotyping

10.3 VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE PENIS AND PREPUCE
it is best initially to examine the dog in the absence of the bitch otherwise he
may be difficult to handle
u ue un si andand a  o non e
 the prepuce should cover the length of the penis
the os penis can be palpated through the prepuce and penis and it should be
smooth in shape and not painful
the penis can normally be relatively easily pushed out of the prepuce to enable
it to be examined; in experienced stud dogs this may initiate ejaculation, which
should be anticipated so that semen can be collected if this occurs
multiple lymphoid nodules are frequently found at the base of the penis on the
bulbus glandis; sometimes these may be traumatized at mating, by exteriorizing
the penis, or during semen collection
examination should also be performed on the erect penis after semen
collection
10.4  PALPATION OF THE SCROTAL CONTENTS
 the scrotal skin should have no lesions; thickened skin or evidence of scarring
is often associated with poor semen quality as there have been a previous
scrotal (testicular) insult
the testes should be freely mobile within the scrotum
testes should be similarly sized and have reasonable tone
the tail of the epididymides should be carefully palpated and should be firm in
texture
10.5
SEMEN COLLECTION AND EVALUATION [1]
Reasons for semen evaluation
to confirm normal spermatogenesis in a young dog before starting a stud career
to monitor semen quality during the career of a stud dog
to ensure suitable semen quality in an aged dog
as part of any artificial insemination programme
prior to semen preservation
in cases of infertility where the dog may be implicated
 to monitor semen production after illness or drug therapy
 to investigate the effect of prostatic disease on semen quality

cal process or lack of sexual excitement
· inexperienced dogs are unlikely to ejaculate in the absence of a bitch in
oestrus
the dog is usually taken to a venue strange to him where he is not used to
'working', which may inhibit even an experienced dog
 slippery floors or personnel wearing white coats may *put the dog off
 failure to collect a sample may upset the dog (and cause extra expense)
NB: Vaginal secretion on swabs from oestrous bitches may be stored frozen and
used to stimulate otherwise reluctant dogs - the thawed swab is held in front of
the dog's nose. The dog pheromone methyl-p-hydoxybenzoate is available com-
mercially in the USA.
It is feasible to collect multiple samples from a fertile dog within 1 day [2].
Select an appropriate collection procedure
owners or handlers who are normally present when the dog mates may encour-
age interest
small breeds are often mated on a table with a suitable surface
 large breeds mate on the floor with various degrees of human guidance
too many observers may distract the dog
the ejaculate consists of three distinct fractions which, for proper evaluation,
should be collected separately:
(a) frst fraction: prostatic fluid
(b}
 second fraction: sperm-rich fluid
(c)  third fraction: prostatic fluid
 techniques for collection should therefore enable the fractional nature to be
recognized and collected
Equipment
It is important that the equipment is not toxic to sperm; research in the author's
laboratory has demonstrated the impact of collection equipment and a variety of
processing steps on sperm viability; without recognizing these effects erroneous
interpretation of fertility can be made [3,4].
equipment required includes:
[a]
two or three glass or plastic funnels
(b)  t
two or three glass or plastic test tubes
NB: Plastic will not break, but because it is light in weight it can easily be dis-
lodged from the hand by the dog's tail or leg.
(c)  a water bath, preferably maintained automatically at 37*C
(d}  a test tube rack in the water bath

Collection technique (Figure 10.1)
 the bitch is adequately restrained by the head or neck
the dog is allowed to sniff and lick at the bitch's vulva
 when the dog seems interested, and before he tries to mount, the penis is held
(usually by the operator's right hand, from the dog's left side)
 if the bulbus glandis is swollen, the prepuce should be pushed backwards to
expose the whole glans
if the bulbus glandis is not swollen, to and fro movement of the prepuce should
stimulate the initial erection
[a]
(q)
[c]
Figure 10.1 Semen collection: (a) the prepuce is pushed backwards to expose the penis;
(b) the penis is reflected backwards between the dog's legs; (c) continued pressure or
rhythmic squeezing of the base of the bulbus glandis stimulates further erection to occur;
(d) the penis is now fully erect and the ejaculate is being collected via a glass funnel.
Clinical Examination of the Male
87
 if the bulbus glandis becomes too swollen it is not possible to protrude the
glans penis from the sheath; the dog should be taken away from the bitch until
his erection has subsided, or an attempt may be made to collect with the penis
in the sheath - this may be uncomfortable for the dog
after exposure of the bulbus glandis, the base of the glans penis is gripped
 between the thumb and fore finger; it may be held firmly or rhythmic contrac-
tions applied
pressure on the base of the penis should stimulate further swelling of the bulbus
glandis with or without thrusting movements of the dog
apart from premature swelling of the bulbus glandis, a major problem in expos-
ing the penis is in long-haired breeds, and in small breeds where holding the
penis is difficult
 during violent thrusting movements there is no point in trying to collect the
ejaculate because it will be the sperm-free first fraction
 if first fraction is collected, it will be seen to be clear fluid
after expulsion of the first fraction the second (sperm-rich and white) fraction
is ejaculated in 4-10 urethral contractions; if possible this should be collected
separately in the second test tube
 occasionally the volume of first fraction can approach 5ml; if a nervous dog
produces no sperm-rich fraction after this, a further collection should be
considered
after the sperm-rich fraction has been expelled, there may be several unproduc-
tive urethral contractions until the third fraction is ejaculated
 if the second fraction is very concentrated and of small volume, several 'spurts'
 j o a  i ysm on Assanau aq A  p jo
into the test tube
· the majority of the third fraction is either collected into the tube containing
first fraction, or the dog is left to finish ejaculating onto the floor
Alternative collection tecbniques
Latex cone
the test tube may be attached to a latex cone, which is placed over the dog's
penis; this is not ideal because it is diffcult to collect the fractions separately
and because the latex may be toxic to sperm
Artificial vagina
because:
(a)it is unnecessary
(b)  it is complicated and cumbersome to use

 it encourages prolonged contact between sperm and the latex liner which
may cause complete immotility of the sperm

Figure 10.2
2The three fractions of the ejaculate. The second fraction is opaque and
containsthe spermatozoa.
Evaluation of the sample (Figure 10.2)
the sample must be kept warm because:
[a]
cooling of the sample causes a reduction in motility which will give a false
impression of the quality of the sample
[b]
 a rapid decrease in temperature may cause “cold-shock’ damage to the
spermatozoa; this rarely occurs in dog semen as it is relatively resistant
to cold shock, and semen is usually collected at room temperature
Volume of the ejaculate
this is measured in a graduated test tube, or by comparing such a tube with
the sample tube
the first fraction is normally 0.5-2.0ml in volume
the second fraction is normally 0.5-1.0ml in volume
the third fraction is normally 15-20ml in volume, but frequently this entire
fraction is not collected
Colour ofthe ejaculate
 the first fraction is normally clear but may be contaminated with urine or cel-
lular debris from the urethra
 the second fraction is normally white or creamy in colour
the third fraction is normally clear
occasionally there may be contamination with blood (especially the third frac
tion in middle-aged or old dogs), or other cells which will cause discoloration.
 If the sample is discoloured, examination of stained semen smears (e.g. using
Clinical Examination of the Male
89
the modified Wright-Giemsa stain, Diff-Quik) may allow identification of
contaminating cellular material such as red blood cells, or white blood cells
Spermatozoal concentration
This can be measured using:
an electronic counting chamber which has been calibrated to count cells of this
size. This is often inaccurate because sperm tails may lodge across the orifice
of the device
a colorimeter previously calibrated for dog semen. This has obvious
inaccuracies
 a haemocytometer counting chamber (Figure 10.3), after suitable dilution of
the sample:
[a]
 a proportion of the semen is well mixed and is diluted 1 in 200 with
distilled water containing a little detergent (the former kills spermatozoa
and the latter prevents their clumping together)
b]
 pue qdp ps e sy m rq a ou peid si dop au
known grid engraved upon its surface. Counting the number of sperma-
tozoa within the grid (known area therefore known volume) allows cal-
culation of the original spermatozoal concentration. It is customary to
count squares diagonally across the grid. Normal values are between
300 × 10° and 800 × 10%/ml, but the total spermatozoal output is a more
useful measure than concentration alone
Total spermatozoal output
this is a more meaningful measure than concentration or volume alone
normal dogs produce between 300 × 106 and 1000 x 106 spermatozoa within
each ejaculate
Figure 10.3 Counting chamber grid. Spermatoza are counted in five of the squares
bounded by three parallel lines.

Percentage motility
 the vessel containing the semen must be placed immediately into a water bath
at approximately 37*C to prevent cooling. A drop of semen is then placed onto
a warmed microscope slide and covered with a cover slip. Evaluation at low
temperatures will give erroneous results
the sample should be assessed under low and high power magnification
the assessment of motility is subjective, but the same observer can become very
consistent
samples should be assessed for the percentage of progressive motility. It is often
easiest to categorize spermatozoal motility, using five groups:
[a]
category O: non-motile spermatozoa
[b]
category I: spermatozoa that are motile but not progressive
[c)
issad iood 1q ao ae ien eozads l Ao
[d]
category IIl: spermatozoa that are motile but moderately progressive
[e]
category IV: spermatozoa that are motile and rapidly progressive (swim-
ming quickly in a forward direction)
NB: Using these criteria normal dogs have more than 70% spermatozoa with
category IV motility.
 in the author's laboratory we have aimed to refine methods for the evaluation
of sperm motility. Initial studies have examined sperm penetration, others
investigated computer assessed swimming criteria and others the ability of
sperm to exhibit normal motility characteristics and penetrate oocytes [5,6,7]
 this work is important as it has enabled translation of laboratory information
into clinical practice
 motility will decrease with time when the slide is left on the microscope stage
(probably due to the effect of light and cooling)
Sperm shape (morpbology) (Figure 10.4)
This is the percentage of spermatozoa that conform to the shape accepted as
normal for dog semen.
 morphology can be examined in wet preparations, but in general fixation and
staining of the sperm is necessary
 a variety of stains have been described including Giemsa
a simple method may be used that allows spermatozoal morphology and
membrane integrity to be established at the same time; this is called ^vital
staining'
vital staining uses a simple stain, nigrosin-eosin, that is best refrigerated
between use
the eosin is taken up by cells that were dead at the time of staining (damaged
membranes), and they therefore appear pink

 across the first slide, as in preparing a smear for haematology
allow the smear to dry (this is usually quite rapid)
examine the slide under the xl00 objective lens using oil; if the spermatozoa
are all overlying each other, another smear should be made using a larger
volume of stain; if the spermatozoa are very sparse, another smear may be
made using less stain

 100 spermatozoa are examined and classified as either alive and normal, dead
or abnormal (Figure 10.5)
Classification of abnormal spermatozoa
spermatozoal abnormalities can be classified into three categories:
[a]
primary abnormalities occur during spermatogenesis
[b]
secondary abnormalities occur during the epididymal  phase  of
development
[c]
tertiary abnormalities occur during collection and processing the sample
Clinical Examination of the Male
93
classification of abnormalities may therefore be useful for elucidating their
origin, and may provide information regarding the likely prognosis
 tables of primary, secondary and tertiary abnormalities are provided in stand-
ard textbooks
the following are common abnormalities:
(a)  head abnormalities:
-  lifted (oedematous) acrosomes
- knobbed acrosomes
 crater defect
[b] 
 neck abnormalities:
 bent neck
 broken neck
[c]
mid piece abnormalities:
 proximal cytoplasmic droplet
 neck tag (disrupted mitochondria)
(d)  tail abnormalities:
-distal cytoplasmic droplet (this is usually accepted as normal)
bent tail
coiled tail
[e]
 spermatozoa which are dead at the time of staining are penetrated by the
tosin (pink)
NB: Normal dogs will have more than 80% morphologically normal live sperma-
tozoa within the ejaculate.
The author has noted that some commercially available nigrosin-eosin stains may
actually cause bending of the tail and mid piece (presumably as a result of incor-
rect osmolarity) and therefore it is recommended that every new stain batch is
carefully tested before being used for clinical diagnosis.
Otber tests for sperm function
The hypo-osmotic swelling test
a test of functional integrity of the spermatozoal membrane
o a oi sssed rem pe suoo onos-ody o psodxa are sads
plasm of sperm that have a functional membrane; these sperm develop bent
tails
 sperm with non-functional membranes do not develop bending of the tail
counting of the percentage of sperm with straight or bent tails after incubation
in this medium correlates well to functional ability of sperm membranes (Figure
10.6)
work in the author's laboratory developed this methodology for clinical prac-
tice in dogs and it has been widely implemented [8]
94
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Figure 10.6 Morphological appearance of a non-swollen sperm and five sperm with
different types of swelling when exposed to hypo-osmotic conditions. The swollen sperm
have intact and functional membranes whereas the non-swollen sperm does not.
Sperm penetration assays
a test of penetrating ability of the sperm (ability to acrosome-react and to
change motility characteristics to a hyperactive form)
pre-determined number of sperm are incubated with homologous oocytes (or
oocytes from hamsters) and the numbers of oocytes penetrated and the number
of penetrating sperm are counted
 in the author's laboratory we pioneered the use of homologous canine oocytes
for sperm penetration assays and demonstrated the value and clinical applica-
bility of this technique [6,9]
 in some cases simple attachment of sperm rather than penetrating ability is
assessed
Sample storage
always put some of the sample into buffered formal saline (roughly 1:1), wax
the bottle cap to prevent evaporation and label the bottle clearly; this provides
for the ability to retrospectively examine all samples in any cases of doubt
Cinical Examination of the Male
95
Overall Interpretation (see also 17.3)
Polymorpbonuclear neutropbils (PMNs, neutrophils) and macrophages
 these may come from the prostate gland but more commonly are contaminants
from the penile wall and preputial lining (see 17.2)
wiping the penis to remove this film of cells before collection is resented by
most dogs
  iq  n sa aq n s aq   os
the motility of the sample is not affected by PMNs unless they are present in
very large numbers
Erythrocytes
 these are commonly seen in the ejaculates of dogs over 5 years old
they undoubtedly originate in the prostate gland, and are usually present in
the absence of clinical disease
 even when present in large numbers, they do not appear to affect sperm motility
at least for short periods of incubation (this is not the case in other species)
Motility
 is significantly affected by temperature and it is important that all evaluations
are undertaken at a standard temperature otherwise variations in temperature
between examinations may result in erroneous interpretation of motility
motility can also be adversely affected by toxic substances that sperm are
exposed to during collection (e.g. dusty collection equipment, water contamina-
tion of equipment, exposure to lubricating gel) [3]
in many fertile dogs total motility is 90-95% with the percentage of normal
motility being only slightly lower (i.e. the majority of sperm have normal
forward progressive motility)
 less than 80% total motility and progressive motility of 60% or less may indi-
cate a reduction in fertility
Morpbology (Figure 10.5)
 the staining technique may affect morphology, e.g. some preparations of
nigrosin-eosin cause bending of the sperm tail
 the sample should be stained as soon as possible after collection
detailed estimation can only be made on samples examined at x1000 (x100
lens and x10 eyepiece) under oil
less than 80% normal live spermatozoa may indicate a reduction in fertility
and a clear relationship to poor fertility has been demonstrated when less than
 60% sperm are morphologically normal at light microscopy
96
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 it is feasible that some abnormalities may not be detected by light microscopy
 the significance of specific sperm abnormalities is outlined below
Acrosome abnormalities
 the acrosome is essential for fusion of the sperm with the oocyte
premature lifting or separation of the acrosome may indicate early capacitation
(a maturation process which usually occurs when the sperm is in the female
genital tract and must occur before the sperm can penetrate an ovum)
 knobbed acrosomes are usually only seen in small numbers in dog semen; in
other species large numbers of knobbed acrosomes cause sterility
the crater defect probably indicates that parts of the DNA (genetic material)
 in the head have not formed properly
Neck abnormalities
bending at the neck or detachment of the head may be caused by rough han-
dling of the sample; usually very few such sperm are present in any one sample
 proximal cytoplasmic droplets are unilateral smooth swellings at the proximal
 mid piece (neck); they are remnants of the cytoplasm of the sperm precursor,
the spermatid
spermatozoa in the head of the epididymis normally have proximal droplets;
such spermatozoa are not immediately capable of fertilization; the presence of
through the epididymis
Mid piece abnormalities
in some dogs infertility is caused by disruption of the continuity of the neck
and mid piece associated with abnormalities of the mitochondria; irregular
swellings (tags) are seen at the neck and along the rest of the mid piece - these
sperm usually have abnormal motility
distal cytoplasmic droplets are located at the distal end of the mid piece and
represent migration of the proximal droplet; they are considered common and
do not appear to affect fertility
Tail abnormalities
 abnormal shaped tails do not allow progressive movement of the spermatozoon
and may compromise both its journey to the uterine (Fallopian) tube, detach-
ment of sperm from epithelium and its ability to penetrate the oocyte
Predicting fertility (see 17.3)
 the wide variety in semen abnormalities is interesting but tends to complicate
the situation with respect to establishing a prognosis for fertility
Clinical Examination of the Male
97
some of the first published data concerning the large variation in semen quality
from fertile dogs came from the author's clinic [10]
 surprising in this data were the poor-quality samples that originate from some
fertile dogs
Comments aboutpredictingfertility
 as long as the dog has not already ejaculated on the collection day, the time of
his previous ejaculation has little effect on his semen quality; however, if a dog
that appears ill-at-ease produces a sample of poor quality, a repeat examination
is indicated since there may be incomplete ejaculation
the dog may have received drugs which will affect semen quality (see Chapter
27)
 as a result of semen analysis, a dog cannot be said to be fertile; fertility includes
the ability to mount and copulate normally and can only be proven if the dog
produces offspring
dogs with seminal values described above should be fertile, i.e. if mated once
or twice to bitches close to ovulation time, and should produce litters of average
size for that breed from 80% or more of the bitches that have been mated
dogs with poor semen quality (low motility, low numbers, many abnormal
sperm) will still be fertile, but more bitches will be expected to fail to become
pregnant; repeated matings to the same bitch around her ovulation time may
increase the likelihood of her conceiving
dogs with no spermatozoa, or very small numbers of dead, abnormal sperma-
tozoa, may:
[a}]
 have been treated with anabolic steroids or other androgens; their effect
is usually reversible and the ejaculate should return to normal in 2 months
b]
 not have ejaculated properly, usually due to nervousness
have suffered a spermatogenic arrest (see 17.3); these dogs are initially
fertile but suffer a rapid, asymptomatic testicular degeneration which
results in permanent aspermia
10.6 MEASUREMENT OF ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE
CONCENTRATIONS
 alkaline phosphatase is produced in high concentrations by the epididymis and
therefore is present within the normal ejaculate at high concentrations
(>5000[U/l)
measurement of alkaline phosphatase is useful when samples are found to be
azoospermic
semen samples can be sent to a commercial biochemistry laboratory for meas-
urement of alkaline phosphatase
azoospermic samples with low concentrations of alkaline phosphatase are
either incomplete ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation or epididymal obstruction
98
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
(rare in the dog). A repeated attempt of semen collection should be made fol-
lowed by catheterization of the urinary bladder to look for sperm in urine
which is found in cases of retrograde ejaculation
azoospermic samples with high concentrations of alkaline phosphatase are
confirmed cases of azoospermia
10.7  ULTRASONOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF THE MALE
REPRODUCTIVE TRACT
Until relatively recently diagnostic ultrasound was overlooked for examination of
the reproductive tract. There is no doubt, however, that this imaging modality
should be part of a normal clinical examination of the male reproductive tract.
Equipment for examination of the dog
linear transducers are most suited to scrotal imaging, but sector transducers
are adequate
sector transducers are most suited to transabdominal imaging
a 7.5 or 10.0MHz transducer is necessary to obtain suitable image definition
ap aesn e s ye asdo e sa ran zo'g e n
of penetration combined with adequate tissue resolution
the principles of ultrasonography and ultrasound terminology are given in 5.8
are useful for examination of the prostate and testes [11,12]
Examination of the dog
cleaning of the scrotum and application of a high viscosity gel is necessary to
obtain good-quality images; clipping the scrotal hair should be avoided as this
invariably traumatizes the scrotal skin and results in significant licking and
self-trauma
 clipping the hair of the ventral abdomen is required for examination of the
prostate gland
 in many patients imaging is most conveniently performed with the dog in the
standing position
The normal testis and epididymis
 the author has described several imaging planes examination of the testes [13]:
[a]
transverse
[b]
sagittal
[c)
dorsal
[d]
 pre-scrotal position (allows comparison of left and right testes)
Cinical Examination of the Male
99
Figure 10.7 Ultrasound image: (a) the left testes in longitudinal section; the hypoechoic
epididymides can be dearly seen. The central echogenic line within each testis is the
as a central echogenic spot. 7.5 MHz transducer, scale in centimetres.
 the testicular parenchyma appears relatively hypoechoic with regular diffuse
echogenic stippling scattered evenly throughout the organ
the stippling represents an extension of the fibrous mediastinum which is
responsible for supporting the parenchymal tissue
 the mediastinum and stippled appearance may appear more pronounced when
using higher frequency ultrasound transducers
the mediastinum testis is located centrally within the tesis. In a sagittal plane
this structure appears as an echogenic line approximately 2mm wide extending
from the cranial to the caudal pole, whilst in the transverse plane it appears as
a central echogenic circular structure (Figure 10.7)
acoustic shadowing is often noted distal to the mediastinum testis
surrounding the testis the hyperechoic summed testicular and vaginal tunics
are clearly defined
the head and body of the epididymis are often difficult to identify
the epididymal tail has a triangular-shaped appearance and is positioned on
the caudal pole of the testis
Relationsbip between testicular size and semen quality
 ultrasound can be used to accurately measure testicular size and to calculate
testicular volume [13]
the formula for calculation of testicular volume is:
volume =  π(length × width × depth)
size
100
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 in addition there is a general relationship between testicular size and semen
quality, this is not always the case and some azoospermic dogs, and dogs with
severe spermatozoal abnormalities may have a normal testicular volume
Relationsbip betweentesticular ultrasound appearance and
semen quality
 whilst testes have a hypoechoic background and an obvious stippled pattern
this appearance is homogenous in the normal dog
testes which appear more heterogenous are often associated with poor semen
quality (Figure 10.8)
testes which appear overall to be more hypoechoic than normal are often
associated with poor semen quality
Relationship between ultrasound appearance and testicular patbology
we have described a range of different testicular and scrotal pathologies that
can be detected using real-time ultrasound examination [13,14]

The normal prostate gland
examination of the prostate gland is facilitated by the presence of fluid within
the bladder
this can be achieved by preventing urination, or the infusion of sterile isotonic
saline via a catheter
Clinical Examination of the Male
101
Figure 10.9 Transverse section ultrasound image of normal dog prostate demonstrating
total width and height of the left and right lobes.
imaging is achieved by placing the ultrasound transducer on the caudo-ventral
abdomen adjacent to the prepuce
 imaging may be difficult if the gland lies entirely within the pelvis as may be
the case in a young dog where where the gland is small; however, the transducer
may be placed into the dog's rectum and directed ventrally to allow adequate
imaging of the caudal prostate
 the normal prostate gland is well circumscribed, although frequently the pro-
static capsule is difficult to identify because its specular echo is sensitive to the
direction of the ultrasound
 the gland usually has a symmetrical bi-lobed outline
there is a midline furrow dorsal to the prostatic urethra
 the prostatic parenchyma is moderately echogenic, and has coarse stippling
 present evenly throughout the gland (Figure 10.9)
 at the hilar region the prostate has linear echogenic streaks associated with
peri-urethral tissue
the prostatic urethra is often visible only when the ultrasound strikes it at 90
degrees
in dogs that are sedated or anaesthetized the urethra may be urine filled and
therefore appears as an anechoic line in longitudinal section
 there is a weak correlation between body size and volume of the prostate gland
 in the castrated male the prostate is small and hypoechoic, the smallest size
being found in dogs castrated before puberty
Relationsbipbetweenultrasoundappearanceandsemenquality
prostatic heterogeneity does not correlate with semen quality
prostatic echogenicity does not correlate with semen quality
102
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
a large prostatic volume is associated with a larger volume of prostatic fluid
at the time of ejaculation
The use of colour-flow and contrast-enbanced ultrasound
it can be difficult to determine the difference between benign and malignant
lesions of the testes and prostate
there are however difference in vascularization which may be demonstrated
using colour-flow and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography; we have published
baseline normal values and shown how these are perturbed in clinical cases of
prostate pathology [11,12]
 generally perfusion parameters are higher for neoplastic lesions
10.8 MEASUREMENT OF PLASMA HORMONES
 Measurement of basal plasma (serum) hormone concentrations has limited appli-
 cation in the infertile dog.
Plasma (serum) testosterone concentration
testosterone concentrations vary widely throughout the day
single samples are often not diagnostic
basal testosterone is only useful for the demonstration of functional testicular
tissue
[a]
entire dogs have testosterone concentrations above 4.0 ng/ml (14.0 nmol/l)
[b)
castrated  dogs  have  testosterone  concentrations  below   2.Ong/ml
(7.0 nmol/l)
[c]
S a in res sa ar sas  m sis
(d)  bilaterally cryptorchid dogs have values similar to entire dogs
NB: Single samples from entire dogs may be taken at the ^trough' of daily produc
tion and therefore appear basal.

concentrations may develop in cases of   impaired

spermatogenesis
[a]
 normal dogs have FSH concentrations below 70ng/ml
[b]
 castrated dogs have FSH concentrations above 700 ng/ml
[c]
dogs with impaired spermatogenesis have FSH concentrations above

(d] 
 bilaterally cryptorchid dogs have values similar to entire dogs
NB: Preferably, mean values should be calculated after collecting serial samples

10.9 OBSERVATION OF MATING BEHAVIOUR
 it is always important to observe mating attempts in dogs that are said to be
infertile
 common difficulties at otherwise normal mating are described in 9.4
10.10 BACTERIAL EXAMINATION OF THE MALE
REPRODUCTIVE TRACT
all male dogs have a resident commensal bacterial flora
this may be associated with a persistent or recurrent mucopurulent discharge
the bacteria isolated may change daily
many species of bacteria are present, including haemolytic streptococci, sta-
phylococci, other streptococci, Escherichia coli, and many others
there is usually a mixed flora with two to five species present
the incidence of anaerobic bacteria is not well documented
Interpretation of bacteriology of the prepuce
these swabs should be expected to contain bacteria
there is no evidence that this is a sign of clinical disease
 there is no evidence in a change in the flora following coitus
104
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
withholding mating because of the isolation of a commensal bacterium (includ-
ing β-haemolytic streptococci) seems unnecessary
 the only known bacterial venereal pathogen is Brucella canis
 dogs in countries where Brucella is present should be routinely screened for
this organism
 otherwise routine bacteriological screening of the clinically normal dog is
pointless
10.11 TESTICULAR BIOPSY
biopsy allows the evaluation of spermatogenesis, and the detection of inflam-
matory and neoplastic cells
 biopsy is, however, very invasive and can itself cause severe testicular changes
excisional wedge biopsy with closure of the tunica albuginea is the least trau-
matic method
tissue should be fixed in Bouin's fixative and examined by an experienced
histopathologist
10.12
TESTICULAR FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION
 requires sedation preferably with a sedative/analgesic compound
 aspiration of the testicular parenchyma using a 20G needle attached to a 10 ml
syringe usually gives an adequate sample
material should be immediately fixed and stained for examination by an expe-
rienced histopathologist
a variety of cell types including spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa
may be identified; Sertoli cells are easily recognized, but in normal dogs limited
 numbers of Leydig cells and spermatogonia are found
subjective scoring of the percentages of each cell type may be useful when
investigating infertile dogs
10.13 PROSTATIC BIOPSY
 true cut biopsies can be obtained in the anaesthetized dog using a transabdomi-
 nal or pararectal approach
wedge biopsy at laparotomy is the preferred method because the procedure
also allows inspection of the prostate gland; this ensures that a representative
sample is collected
ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration may also be useful in allowing the
collection of tissue; one particular advantage is the rapid collection of material
for bacteriological examination in cases of prostatic abscessation
collection of the third fraction of the ejaculate should not be overlooked as a
technique allowing  the bacteriological and  cytological evaluation of  the
prostate
Clinical Examination of the Male
105
10.14 PROSTATIC MASSAGE/URETHRAL FLUSHING
prostatic fluid for bacteriological and cytological evaluation can be obtained
by massage of the prostate transrectally whilst simultaneously flushing the
 prostatic urethra with 5-10 ml of physiological saline
 examination of pre- and post-massage aspirates of the urethra ensures that any
cells identified originate from the prostate
10.15 ENDOCRINOLOGICAL STIMULATION TESTS
(Figure 10.10)
 hormone stimulation tests may be useful to confirm the presence of a functional
pituitary-testicular interaction (the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
stimulation test)
hormone stimulation tests may be useful to confirm the presence of functional
testicular tissue (the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation test)
The gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test
 a plasma (serum) sample is collected and assayed for LH and testosterone
concentration
 a GnRH analogue is injected intravenously (0.01 mg/kg buserelin) and a second
sample is assayed for LH and testosterone concentration 60 minutes later
a significant increase in LH concentration indicates the presence of a functional
pituitary gland
a significant increase in testosterone concentration indicates the presence of a
functional pituitary gland and testicle
the test has not been widely evaluated and it is more common to perform an
hCG stimulation test
The human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation test
· in the author's laboratory we have determined the response of plasma testo-
sterone to hCG in normal dogs and dogs with no testes; this now forms the
basis of a diagnostic test [15]
 hCG is used rather than LH because the latter is not commercially available
 hCG is principally LH-like in activity
·a plasma (serum) sample is collected and assayed for testosterone
concentration
hCG is injected intravenously (50 IU/kg) and a second sample is assayed for
testosterone concentration 60 minutes later
 a significant increase in testosterone concentration indicates the presence of
functional testicular tissue (the test may be used to confirm the presence or

Fertilization and the Optimal
Breeding Time
 It is imperative to understand the normal physiology of the bitch, especially that
associated with normal fertilization, since there are considerable differences to the
other domestic species. Misunderstanding of the normal physiology on behalf of
the breeder is undoubtedly the most common cause of infertility in dogs.
11.1  MATING TIME AND FERTILIZATION TIME
whilst bitches may appear to be very similar in the manifestation of pro-oestrus
and oestrus, bitches differ significantly in when ovulation occurs within the
cycle
 in the author's laboratory we documented for the first time the fact that ovula-
tion could normally be as early as day 5 after the onset of pro-oestrus, or as
late as day 30 after the onset of pro-oestrus [1]
 these data are important because they have changed clinical practice in the way
we manage breeding time in bitches
within the same bitch there are also differences in the time of ovulation from
one cycle to the next
determining when to breed by counting the number of days from the onset of
pro-oestrus is inaccurate since the time of ovulation is variable in relation to
the onset of pro-oestrus (see Figure 3.2)
 this information has been known for 20 years and yet many breeders impose
standard mating regimes (usually mating a defined number of days after the
onset of vulval bleeding; say day 10 and day 12)
this results in many bitches being mated at an inappropriate time, and this
constitutes the commonest cause of apparent infertility
 fortunately, both eggs and spermatozoa have prolonged survival in the female
reproductive tract (this results in the differences between the ‘apparent’ and
the ^actual pregnancy length; see 12.1) and this may overcome to some degree
the error on behalf of the breeder

11.2 REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY
 whilst the time of ovulation is variable in relation to pro-oestrus and oestrus
the hormonal events surrounding ovulation and the physiology of the oocyte
s a  hm e  o as e s p  a
 oestrogen produced by the developing follicles reaches stable concentrations
for 2 days before starting to decline
 approximately 2 days after oestrogen concentrations start to decline there is a
short-lived surge in plasma gonadotrophins (principally LH, so frequently this
is termed the LH surge)
 coincidental with the LH surge there is demonstrable increase in plasma pro-
 gesterone concentrations (progesterone is produced by luteinization of the inner
wall of the follicle prior to ovulation)
the process of ovulation commences 2 days after the LH surge
the oocyte is ovulated in an immature state, and unlike other species cannot
be fertilized immediately
 fertilization can only occur following maturation of the primary oocyte, extru-
sion of the polar body and completion of the first meiotic division
Occytes become fertilizable 2 days after ovulation
oocytes remain viable within the reproductive tract for a further 4-5 days
before degenerating
it is important to remember that sperm are also able to survive within the
female reproductive tract for many days
 in the author's clinic we have undertaken pivotal studies investigating the
interaction between sperm and the female reproductive tract [2,3]
 it is clear that sperm form a reservoir by attachment to epithelium at the tip
of the uterine horns/distal uterine tube; from here sperm wait for specific signals
that cause them to detach and search for an oocyte [4]
 understanding this 'triggering’ of sperm maturation adds to biological knowl-
edge and also offers potential targets to improve fertility and also possibly for
contraception
Two distinct periods of time termed the *fertile period’' and the *fertilization period
can be defined (Figure 11.1) [5].
The “fertilization period'
 this is the time when oocytes can be fertilized
the fertilization period commences 2 days after ovulation (i.e. 4 days after the
pre-ovulatory surge of LH and 4 days after progesterone is first detected in
circulation)
become non-patent; this is generally approximately 5 days after ovulation (i.e.
7 days after the pre-ovulatory surge of LH)

the fertilization period therefore extends between 2 and 5 days after ovulation
(i.e. between 4 and 7 days after the LH surge)
The “fertile period'
this is the time during which a mating could result in a conception
the fertile period can start before oocytes become fertile because it is possible
eggs to become fertilizable
fertile period often commences 5 days before ovulation (sperm *wait' for 5 days
until eggs are released and a further 2 days until they become fertilizable)
for some stud dogs sperm are able to survive for longer periods of time, whilst
in others, or when preserved semen has been used, the sperm are able to survive
only for a short time
the fertile period terminates when oocytes degenerate and so it ends at the same
time as the end of the fertilization period
for an average fertile stud mating a bitch the fertile period therefore starts 5
days before ovulation and lasts until 5 days after ovulation (i.e. 3 days before
the LH surge until 7 days after the LH surge)
 for many dogs mating during the broad fertile period will result in a pregnancy,
however when semen quality is poor mating must occur during the fertilization
period
work in our laboratory was the first to accurately quantify fertilization rates
in dogs [6]; these data show high rates in normal dogs and provide a baseline
to measure abnormal cycles against
112
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
11.3  ASSESSING THE OPTIMAL TIME FOR MATING [7]
the optimal mating time is best considered to be during, or immediately preced-
ing the fertilization period
 in clinical studies the period of peak ferility for natural matings has been
confirmed to be from 1 day before, until 6 days after, the LH surge, which fits
what is expected from understanding of the physiology
 it is very important to remember, however, that the time of ovulation cannot
be reliably predicted by counting the number of days from the onset of pro-
oestrus and neither can it be predicted by confirmation of a change to oestrous
behaviour (i.e. by teasing with a stud dog)
accurate determination of the optimal time to mate can therefore only be
assessed by documenting the LH surge, or by methods that reliably indicate
the fertile or preferably the fertilization period (including measurement of
plasma progesterone, or assessment of changes of the reproductive tract which
are caused by fluctuations in hormonal concentrations)
 when the use of poor-quality semen is contemplated (for example the use of
preserved semen), insemination should be performed only during the fertiliza-
tion period, to ensure success
Clinical assessments
Counting the number of days
 many dogs breeders rely upon counting the number of days from the onset of
pro-oestrus
many dog breeders believe that bitches always ovulate a defined number of
days from the onset of this pro-oestrus; this is not true
d go n an r s zh    , a 
[a]s
 some bitches ovulate as early as day 5 after the onset of pro-oestrus
[b]
 some bitches ovulate as late as day 30 after the onset of pro-oestrus
(Figure 3.2)
 mating on the 12th and 14th days, which is common breeding practice, may
therefore fail to result in conception
Oestrous bebawiour
 the classical definition of oestrus is a change in female behaviour from attrac-
tiveness of the male but refusal to allow mating to acceptance of mating
the onset of oestrus can easily be demonstrated in the bitch by teasing with a
male to look for a change in this behaviour
whilst initial studies observing laboratory beagles suggested that the onset of
ap si stu ns Ht au se a aes au ie panno sso huns
not the case in many bitches, especially those that live in human households
Fertilization and the Optimal Breeding Time
113
 if these data were always reliable it would be relatively easy to determine when
to breed since the optimal time would commence 4 days later (2 days after the
LH surge would be ovulation, and 2 days later would be when oocytes became
fertilizable)
we now know however that in many bitches the behavioural events correlate
poorly with the underlying hormonal events such that assessing teasing behav-
iour alone does not result in a high pregnancy rate
Vulwalsoftening
during pro-oestrus there are elevated concentrations of oestrogen which result
in the vulva and perineal tissues becoming enlarged, oedematous and somewhat
turgid
 there is a dramatic decline in oestrogen concentrations which reach low values
at the time of the LH surge (Figure 11.2)
· the removal of the effects of oestrogen result in distinct vulval softening which
is pronounced at the time of the LH surge
the first day that vulval softening is detected can therefore be used as an indica-
tor of the day of the LH surge
 mating should therefore commence 4 days after the onset of vulval softening
(2 days after the LH surge would be ovulation, and 2 days later would be when
Oocytes became fertilizable)
when clinical assessments alone are available, the combination of the onset of
standing oestrus and the timing of vulval softening may be useful because each
event occurs, on average, 4 days before the beginning of the fertilization period
but other methods are substantially more reliable
Figure 11.2 Dramatic softening of the vulva noted at 1 day after the LH surge.
114

Endocrine assessment
Measurement of plasma LH (see 5.9)
we have documented that measurement of the plasma concentration of LH is
a reliable and accurate method for determining the optimum time to mate [8]
LH can also be measured in urine, but concentrations are low and this assay
is unreliable
 there is, however, no readily available commercial assay for canine LH
Measurement of plasma progesterone
 in the bitch, plasma progesterone concentration begins to increase from base-
line approximately 2 days before ovulation (the result of pre-ovulatory luteini-
zation) at approximately the same time as the LH surge
 progesterone concentrations are substantially elevated and easily detectable on
the day of ovulation (values are often between 3.0 and 5.0ng/ml depending
upon the assay)
 in our laboratory we have documented the rise in progesterone and demon-
strated that its measurement can be clinically useful for determining the optimal
time to breed and for improving pregnancy rates and litter size [9]
serial monitoring of plasma progesterone therefore allows:
[a]
anticipation of ovulation
[b]
confirmation of ovulation
[c]
 detection of the fertilization period
 the initial rise in progesterone is gradual; therefore it is only necessary to collect
 blood samples every second or third day
mating or insemination should be planned between 4 and 6 days after the
 plasma progesterone concentration exceeds 2.0ng/ml (6.5 nmol/l) (the value at
the time of the LH surge), or should preferably commence 1 day after values
exceed 8-10.0ng/ml (25.0-32.0nmol/l) (the beginning of the fertilization
period) (Figure 11.3)
 progesterone may be measured by radioimmunoassay or an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kit (see 5.9)
various test kits are available commercially and can be run within the practice
laboratory. These kits can be semi-quantitative or qualitative and either offers
some advantages and disadvantages [10]
NB: The author has demonstrated the possibility of running ELISA tests for pro-
 gesterone using whole blood and vaginal fluid which removes the need for cen-
trifugation [11,12].
Vaginal cytology (see 5.5)
the change in concentrations of oestrogen and progesterone during pro-oestrus,
oestrus and the early luteal phase cause substantial effects upon the reproduc-

vagina
 collection, staining and microscopic examination of exfoliated vaginal cells is
a simple method for monitoring the stage of the oestrous cycle
the relative proportions of different types of epithelial cell can be used as
markers of the endocrine environment
the fertile (not fertilization) period can be predicted by calculating the percent-
age of epithelial cells that appear anuclear when using a modified Wright-
Giemsa stain
mating should be attempted throughout the period when:
[a]
 more than 80% of epithelial cells are anuclear (the fertile period) (Figure
11.4)

whilst vaginal cytology is a useful technique it should be remembered that:
[a]
PMNs may be found throughout the fertile period in some bitches
[b]
in some bitches peak values of only 60% anuclear cells are reached
Crystallization of cervico-vaginal mucus
work in our laboratory has shown that mucus is present within the vaginal
smear (if collected by aspiration), and can be examined by microscopic inspec-
tion of unstained smears [13]
the mucus originates from glandular tissue within the cervix and cranial vagina
 sa-ond  so q ai e d oqe s1 ui  
oestrus; in oestrus there are large parallel branches of the crystallization pattern
and greater areas of the slide are covered with mucus crystals (see 5.5}
our studies demonstrate that this technique can be clinically useful [14]
Vaginal endoscopy (see also 5.7)
vaginoscopic assessment is based upon observation of:
[a]
mucosal fold contours and profiles
[b]
the colour of the mucosa
[c]
the colour of any fluid present
Fertilization and the Optimal Breeding Time
117
bitches progress through various stages of mucosal proliferation, oedema,
swelling, shrinkage, angulation and decline (denoted I, O, S1, S2, A1, A2, A3,
D1, D2, D3, D4, I) (see 5.7)
 this proliferation and regression is repeatable between bitches and we have
shown that it can be used to accurately stage the oestrous cycle [8,15]
 all bitches reach the stage of marked furrowing, wrinkling and indentation
(denoted S2) at 2 days before ovulation, and shrinkage with angulation such
 that the peaks are sharp-tipped and irregular in appearance (A2) at 4 days after
ovulation (Figure 11.5)

breeding should be planned on at the appearance of A1 stage, with breeding
being ideal on the first day of stage A2 which is in the middle of the fertiliza-
tion period
· the method is simple to perform, inexpensive and reliable for determining the
optimal time to breed
Additional examination of cervico-vaginal secretion
the electrical resistance of the vaginal secretions decreases during late oestrus,
but measurement of electrical resistance has not been proven to be a reliable
indicator of the optimal time to breed, indeed in individual bitches electrical
resistance can vary haphazardly without any relation to the underlying endo.
crine environment
some workers claim that the concentration of glucose within the vaginal dis
charge can be used to predict the optimal mating time, but the technique has
failed to stand up to scientific investigation
vaginal pH and glucose concentration also do not reliably correlate with stage
of the oestrous cycle in a way to be clinically useful
crystallization of mucus collected from the anterior vagina may be useful in
combination with vaginal cytology for determining the optimal mating time
(see Crystallization of cervico-vaginal mucus in this section, and 5.5)

Pregnancy and Lactation
12.1
PREGNANCY LENGTH
The 'apparent' pregnancy length
this is usually taken to be the interval between the first mating and
parturition
fertile matings have been recorded between 9 days before and 5 days after
ovulation
the apparent length of pregnancy can therefore vary between 58 days and 72
days
The ‘actual' pregnancy length
the interval between ovulation and the day of parturition is consistently 62-64
days; this is termed the actual pregnancy length
the day of onset of parturition can therefore be predicted by detection of events
that occur during oestrus (for example parturition occurs 64-66 days after the
pre-ovulatory LH surge, 62-64 days after ovulation, 61-63 days after proges-
terone concentrations reach high values)
 on average parturition occurs 57 days after the onset of cytological metoestrus
(see 3.5 and 5.5) but this relationship is not as reliable as measurement of LH
or progesterone
 progesterone concentrations are elevated for the duration of pregnancy until
24-36 hours before parturition when there is an abrupt decline
 detection of this decline in progesterone can therefore also be used to predict
the onset of expected parturition
these techniques work well since progesterone can be easily measured using an
ELISA technique in the practice laboratory [1]
 coincidental with the pre-partum decline in progesterone is a decrease in rectal
temperature. This pre-partum hypothermia may be detected clinically and be
useful for predicting parturition (see 14.4)

ENDOCRINE CHANGES IN BLOOD (Figure 12.1)
Progesterone
se sii aus a uard, a se paqsp uo si arisod
appear essential for maintenance of the normal pregnancy. These include
closure of the cervix, reduced uterine contractions, endometrial glandular
development, increased endometrial glandular secretion and, importantly,
enlargement of the mammary glands
concentrations of progesterone are however similar during pregnancy to those
in non-pregnant bitches (those in normal metoestrus (dioestrus))
 the uterus does not synthesize progesterone as in other species and the corpora
lutea are the sole site of production
 in late pregnancy progesterone concentrations are relatively low, but fall sharply
when the corpora lutea are lysed 24-36 hours pre-partum [1]
Oestrogen
 the role of oestrogen for much of pregnancy is not certain but it has an impor-
tant roles in mammary development prior to lactation and relaxation of the
reproductive tract prior to parturition
 concentrations are probably the same in pregnancy as in metoestrus (dioestrus);
reported differences may reflect measurement of different oestrogens by differ
ent assay systems
oestrogen concentrations increase steadily throughout pregnancy and reach
peak values immediately before parturition
 concentrations decrease abruptly to basal after parturition
122
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Prolactin
 prolactin has several roles in pregnancy, importantly these include stimulation
of milk production, but also progesterone is luteotrophic (it stimulates the
production of progesterone); indeed it is the most important luteotrophic
hormone in the bitch
-oo sd se rd yo q r a u ar sa
trations decrease (this increase follows the decrease in progesterone and is an
attempt to maintain progesterone production since prolactin is luteotrophic)
 similar changes in prolactin occur in non-pregnant bitches and are associated
with false pregnancy, although the broad rise in prolactin during the second
cycles
there is a transient large surge during the decline in progesterone 24-36 hours
before parturition
 prolactin concentrations are elevated but fluctuate during lactation
Relaxin
 relaxin has an important role in pregnancy which is to ensure that there are
changes in the reproductive tract that will allow the passage of the fetuses at
the end of pregnancy
 concentrations of relaxin start to increase from the 25th day; this can be used
as a pregnancy test and a commercially available kit is commonly used in
veterinary practice
 peak values occur at days 40-50 and are followed by a slight decline before
parturition
·relaxin is the only known pregnancy-specific hormone in the dog
12.3 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTUS
in the bitch when oocytes are ovulated they are not fully mature (they are
ovulated as primary oocytes)
 a and on oq rod a j xa m o 
(secondary) oocyte occurs during the 2-3 days after ovulation
the secondary oocyte (ovum) can be fertilized from 2 days until about 5 days
after ovulation
 fertilization of the ovum occurs in the distal Fallopian (uterine) tube
the ferilized ovum is called the zygote
 rapid division (cleavage) of the zygote produces a morula which is a solid ball
of cells
 the morulae enter the uterus from the Fallopian tubes at about 9 days after
ovulation, i.e. about 6 days after fertilization
Pregnancy and Lactation
123
a cavity (the blastocoele) develops rapidly in the centre of the morula (which
is now composed of about 30 cells) and the resulting fluid-filled sphere is called
a blastocyst
 the single-cell-thick wall of the blastocyst will develop into the fetal membranes
which contribute to the placenta; a small button of cells to one side of the
cavity, the inner cell mass, will mainly give rise to the embryo proper
until this stage the developing embryo has remained the same size as the origi-
nal ovum because it has been surrounded by a non-cellular membrane, the zona
pellucida; with successive divisions the cells have become smaller
disappearance of the zona pellucida allows the developing conceptus to increase
in size
the conceptuses grow and arrange themselves in a roughly even manner along
the uterine horns, but are not attached to the endometrium until 21 days after
ovulation (this is very late compared with many domestic species)
 between the 21st and 40th day, each growing conceptus is roughly spherical
until the 35th day, there is a portion of constricted uterus between each of these
discrete conceptuses (Figure 12.2)
 after 35 days, continued growth of the conceptuses expands the constrictions,
so that adjacent chorio-allantoic membranes come into contact with each other
and both uterine horns become uniformly distended
tarly in pregnancy there is a relatively large amount of fetal fluid (mainly in
the yolk sac) compared with the size of the developing puppy (embryo)
 at about 35 days the arrangement of cells within the embryo, i.e. the process 
of organogenesis, is complete and thereafter the developing individual is called
a fetus; its subsequent development is mainly due to an increase in size
 as pregnancy develops, the allantois becomes the main fluid-filled cavity in the
conceptus, but the volume of fluid becomes relatively reduced compared with
the size of the growing fetus [2]; in the early stages the very delicate embryo
requires cushioning (by fluid) from external stimuli; the larger fetus is more
robust and needs less *protection'

Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
the small amount of fetal fluid that remains at parturition acts as a lubricant
during birth
12.4 DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLACENTA
at around the 21st day after ovulation, a permanent attachment begins to
develop between each conceptus and the endometrium; this process in the bitch
is best described as nidation (and sometimes wrongly called implantation) and
results in the formation of the placenta
the placenta is the union between the outer set of fetal membranes (the allan-
tochorion) and the lining of the uterus (the endometrium)
vascular finger-like villi on the surface of the allantochorion fit tightly into
cavities (crypts) in the endometrium; exchange of gases and nutrients occurs 
between the circulatory systems (capillaries) of the dam and fetus in the
placentae
 the placenta of the dog is described as being zonary, i.e. there is a band of
placental attachment around the centre of each conceptus whilst at the poles
there is no placenta (Figure 12.2)
 over most of this placental area the epithelium and connective tissue of the
endometrium are lost, so that the villi are in direct contact with maternal capil-
laries; the placenta is said to be endotheliochorial
 along both edges of the placental zone the maternal blood vessels rupture; the
leaked blood is contained along the periphery of the placenta and is called the
haemochorial border or marginal haematoma
the marginal haematomas contain large pools of stagnant maternal blood from
which the extra-embryonic circulation absorbs various metabolites, especially
iron
 destruction of the blood pigment haemoglobin in this marginal haematoma
produces the green uteroverdin; this is seen when placentae start to break down
at parturition
12.5  OTHER CHANGES DURING PREGNANCY
A variety of behavioural and morphological changes occur during pregnancy,
many progress to parturition.
Behaviour
early in pregnancy there are no obvious changes in behaviour
 bitches often become anorexic at around the time of nidation but then appetite
tends to increase in the latter two-thirds of pregnancy
in the last one-third of pregnancy the bitch may make a nest and become pro-
tective of the nest area; some bitches start to collect toys in the nest area
Pregnancy and Lactation
125
s s   a d aq s a i a 
these behavioural events are not diagnostic of pregnancy since they are com-
monly seen in non-pregnant bitches with signs of pseudopregnancy (see 19.8)
Appetite
this is commonly depressed in the first one-third of pregnancy; it does not affect
the growth of pups but may alarm the owner
appetite then increases
during late pregnancy the bitch should be given several small meals a day
Abdominal enlargement
there is no noticeable change in body conformation until day 45-50
overfeeding may mimic pregnancy
the total bodyweight of the bitch may increase 20-55% during gestation
 in the last third of pregnancy the bitch will lose her waist and the abdomen
may appear pendulous
Mammary development
 an increase in blood supply may be seen in all bitches, around 25-30 days after
ovulation, i.e. the veins around the base of the nipples become more
 prominent
 mammary gland enlargement is often noticeable from mid-pregnancy onwards
(but this is similar in bitches that are not pregnant)
 milk in both pregnancy and pseudopregnancy
Haematology changes
 there are considerable changes in blood profle that occur in pregnancy; these
are overlooked in many textbooks
 at approximately 33-37 days of gestation there is an increase in concentrations
of acute phase proteins in blood; this may be used as a method of pregnancy
diagnosis (see 13.8)
a progressive anaemia starts during the third week of pregnancy; it appears not
to affect the health of the bitch:
 s Ap e %o u s  s (od) aa a paoed a (e)
below 35% at term
[b]  t
 the major cause of the anaemia is the result of increased plasma volume
causing haemodilution
from 1 week after oestrus there is reduced sensitivity to insulin, but not gluca-
gon, and this may aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus
126
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Mucoid vulval discharge
 this is often present such that the author considers this normal in early
pregnancy
 a normal vulval discharge must be distinguished from the pathological dis-
charge due to pyometra, which occurs at the same stage of the cycle (see 16.5)
12.6 PRODUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND EJECTION
OF MILK
Lactation
the production and secretion of milk is called lactation
initial development of the mammary gland is stimulated by oestrogen when the
bitch is in oestrus, and is followed by maturation and further development of
the gland during the long luteal phase (of pregnancy or non-pregnancy)
as progesterone concentrations decrease in late pregnancy there is reduced
inhibition on prolactin inhibitory factor and so prolactin is secreted from the
anterior pituitary gland
elevated concentrations of prolactin in the primed mammary gland is respon-
sible for the onset of lactation
Excretion of milk
 the active excretion of milk is stimulated by release of oxytocin from the pos-
terior pituitary gland
 oxytocin causes contraction of myoepithlial cells
oxytocin release is triggered by either a neurological reflex (stimulation of the
nipple) or is conditioned by smells or sounds of the neonates
other endocrine factors are also involved in milk letdown and these can be
inhibited by adrenaline; therefore stressful situations, including surgical inter-
vention at the time of parturition, can result in failure of milk excretion (failure
of milk letdown); this can be treated by administration of oxytocin
NB: Failure of milk production (agalactia) cannot be treated by oxytocin admin-
istration (see 22.19).
Galactopoiesis
 the maintenance of milk production is termed galactopoiesis
the process of stimulation of the posterior pituitary gland, oxytocin release,
and the other hormonal changes are the mechanism by which milk production
is maintained
Pregnancy and Lactation
127
at weaning there is a reduction in sucking by the pups, therefore less oxytocin
release and so milk production ultimately ceases

Pregnancy Diagnosis
In most domestic species pregnancy interrupts normal cyclical activity by increas-
ing the length of the luteal phase and delaying the return to oestrus. The physiology
of the bitch is unlike other species in that the luteal phase is similar in length for
both pregnancy and non-pregnancy. In addition, the fertilization period of the
bitch differs from that of most other mammals. In particular it should be remem-
bered that:
in most bitches the day of ovulation is not known and both ^early' and late
matings can result in a pregnancy:
a]
 when the interval from ovulation to parturition is calculated this is always
62-64 days; mating on the day of ovulation will result in whelping com-
mencing at the expected time
b)
matings that occur before ovulation may be fertile should spermatozoa
reside within the reproductive tract ^waiting for ovulation; counting from
 this *early' mating to parturition results in an apparently long pregnancy
length (up to 72 days from mating to parturition)
[c]
 Oocytes remain fertilizable for at least 5 days after ovulation; matings that
 d s a  n sa  o  
(as short as 58 days from mating to parturition)
 this physiological variation is important for pregnancy diagnosis since:
[a] 
 bitches that are examined for pregnancy diagnosis after an 'early' mating
will appear to have a pregnancy that may not be as advanced as expected;
it the worst case scenario a bitch that is examined shortly after mating
for pregnancy diagnosis may be falsely diagnosed and not pregnant
 because the examination was undertaken before a positive diagnosis could
be made
b]
 bitches that are examined for pregnancy diagnosis after a “late’ mating
will appear to have a pregnancy that may be further advanced than
expected
endocrine changes in the bitch are dissimilar to those of the majority of other
domestic species and methods of pregnancy diagnosis cannot simply be adapted

Pregnancy Diagnosis

13.1
ABSENCE OF A RETURN TO OESTRUS
 in the bitch the inter-oestrous interval is almost identical in pregnant and non-
pregnant cycles
an absence of a return to oestrus is not specific for pregnancy
13.2
BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES
 both pregnant and non-pregnant bitches may exhibit behavioural changes
typical of pregnancy
these are usually
associated with an increase in plasma prolactin
concentration
 food intake may increase in both pregnant and non-pregnant bitches
13.3  PHYSICAL CHANGES
pregnant bitches commonly have a small volume mucoid vulval discharge
approximately 1 month after mating
 abdominal swelling may be noted from day 40 of pregnancy
mammary gland enlargement is usually obvious from day 35, at which time
serous fluid can be expressed from the glands
colostrum may be present in the teats in the last 7 days of pregnancy
NB: Similar features are common in pseudopregnant bitches.
13.4 ABDOMINAL PALPATION
can be highly accurate if performed at an appropriate stage of pregnancy
may be difficult in large, obese or nervous animals 
may be inaccurate if the bitch was mated ^early’ such that pregnancy is not as
advanced as anticipated
Technique
Small dogs
 one hand can be used for abdominal palpation
abdominal contents are then allowed to pass between the fingers and thumb
as the hand is drawn ventrally
Large dogs
a two-handed technique is preferable
 ideally the owner and clinician should be seated and facing each other
130
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
the owner holds the bitch's head
 then the clinician's extended hands are placed on either side of the abdomen,
midway between the anterior pelvis and last rib
 both hands simultaneously compress the abdomen and are then moved dorsally
so that viscera slip between the fingers
Interpretation
 the optimum time for diagnosis is approximately 1 month after mating
[a]
the conceptuses are spherical in outline, and may vary between 15 and
 30 mm in diameter
[b] t
 they are tense fluid-filled structures and can be readily palpated
from day 35 the conceptuses become elongated, enlarged and tend to lose their
 stn ie aeded on Asa sal aq e Aau issas
after day 45 the uterine horns tend to fold upon themselves, resulting in the
caudal portion of each horn being positioned against the ventral abdominal
wall, and the cranial portion of the same horn being positioned dorsally
 after day 55 the fetuses can often be identified, especially if the forequarters of
the bitch are elevated and the uterus is manipulated caudally towards the pelvis
 it is difficult to accurately count the number of conceptuses by palpation except
when performing an early examination
13.5 IDENTIFICATION OF FETAL HEART BEATS
e sn sieaq eau lay a o aissd si iu rd al u!
stethoscope
 fetal hearts may also be detected by recording a fetal electrocardiogram
Doppler ultrasound machines (commonly used for pregnancy diagnosis in
sows) can be used for detection of fetal heart beats
all three methods are diagnostic of pregnancy but none are commonly used
fetal heart beats are simple to detect because the heart rate is usually more than
twice that of the dam
13.6
RADIOGRAPHY
uterine enlargement can be detected from day 30
at this stage the enlarged uterus can be readily identified in the caudal abdomen,
originating dorsal to the bladder and ventral to the rectum; it frequently pro-
duces cranial displacement of the small intestine
the early pregnant uterus has only soft tissue opacity and cannot be differenti-
ated from other causes of uterine enlargement, such as pyometra
correct pregnancy diagnosis is not possible until after day 45 when mineraliza-
tion of the fetal skeleton is detectable
Pregnancy Diagnosis
131
progressive mineralization results in an increasing number of bones that can
be identified (Figure 13.1)
it is unlikely that the fetuses will be damaged by the ionizing radiation after
day 45; however,
(a )   earlier examination during organogenesis is potentially hazardous
(b)  sedation or anaesthesia of the dam may be required and is a potential risk
 in late pregnancy the number of pups can be reliably estimated by counting
the number of fetal skulls

skeleton can be seen (a skull is easily visible overlying the last rib) (courtesy of Marco Russo)
13.7 ENDOCRINOLOGICAL TESTS (Figure 13.2)
plasma (serum) concentrations of progesterone are not useful for the diagnosis
of pregnancy
 pregnancy-specific changes in plasma and urine oestrogen concentration have
not been adequately evaluated
with non-pregnant bitches but this method has not been adequately
evaluated
Relaxin
 measurement of the hormone relaxin is diagnostic of pregnancy and an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay is commercially available which can be run in the
practice laboratory; this method is simple, rapid and reliable and is suitable
when the practice does not have a diagnostic ultrasound machine
relaxin is produced by the placenta and there is some evidence that plasma
concentrations are higher in bitches with greater number of fetuses (there is
more placental tissue)

 this response appears to be unique to the bitch
fbrinogen, C-reactive protein or other acute phase proteins are all sensitive
markers of pregnancy
the initial rise in these proteins occurs from day 20 onwards with a peak at
approximately day 40
false positive diagnoses may result from inflammatory conditions (such as
 pyometra which occurs at the same stage of the oestrous cycle)
 the rise in fibrinogen concentration is now the basis of a commercial pregnancy
test
13.9
ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION (See also 5.8)
When planning diagnosis of pregnancy it is important to consider the variability
between the day of mating and the time of ovulation (see 11.1) which may result
in a pregnancy being more or less advanced than anticipated. The author prefers
            
conceptuses are usually aged between 22 and 33 days from ovulation; at this
 stage an absence of conceptuses on ultrasound examination is diagnostic of
non-pregnancy.

yolk sac fluid accumulates within the yolk sac and it is not until the yolk sac
is filled with a sufficient volume of fluid that the pregnancy can first be imaged
 the anechoic (black appearing) yolk sac can first imaged from 15 days after
ovulation (remember mating may not coincide with ovulation)
at 15 days the anechoic yolk sacs are approximately 2 mm in diameter and are
spherical in appearance
 at this stage of early pregnancy the embryo is located adjacent to the uterine
wall and is not imaged
the conceptus rapidly increases in size and may lose its spherical outline,
becoming oblate (rugby ball shaped) in appearance

 from day 20 after ovulation the conceptus is approximately 7mm in diameter
and 15 mm in length, and the embryo can be imaged
 the presence of the embryonic heart beat can be detected from approximately
22 days after ovulation
 the developing allantois initially appears as a nearly spherical structure within
the conceptus which subsequently increases in size and surrounds the yolk sac
 a third fluid-filled sac, the amnion, may be noted later in pregnancy since it
surrounds, and initially is in close apposition to, the fetus 
Mid pregnancy (Figure 13.4)
 the most rapid growth of the fetus occurs between days 32 and 55; during this
time the limb buds become obvious and there is clear differentiation of the
head, trunk and abdomen

 model for the assessment of canine pregnancy, estimation of fetal age and pre-
many ultrasound machines have the data programmed into function menus to
enable calculation of gestational age during the examination)
 the zonary placenta can usually be easily identified from this stage of pregnancy
onwards
the fetal skeleton becomes evident from day 40 onwards when fetal bone
appears hyperechoic, and casts acoustical shadows
the heart can now be easily identified and large arteries and veins can be seen
cranially and caudally
lung tissue surrounding the heart is hyperechoic with respect to the liver
from 45 days onwards it is possible to identify the fluid-filled (anechoic)
stomach, and a few days later the bladder can be imaged

the head, spinal column and ribs produce intense reflections of the ultrasound

the small intestine may be detected
at this stage the fetus is highly mobile, and limb and whole body movements
occur frequently
swallowing movements can be observed
hiccupping may occasionally be noticed
it is difficult to examine more than a few fetuses at this time without clipping
an excessive amount of hair

Assessment of fetal number [1]
the accuracy of detecting absolute fetal number is poor
the greatest accuracy is at the first examination 1 month after mating
the lowest accuracy is in late pregnancy
 most commonly the number of fetuses is underestimated
 the accuracy is reduced in large litters
Errors with real-time ultrasonography [1,2]
False positive
 such scans are unlikely although empty loops of small intestine and the caudal
 pole of the kidney may confuse the inexperienced operator
resorption of several conceptuses has been seen and may account for the
absence of puppies after a positive scan
False negative
failure to detect early pregnancies may occur because:
a]
nation is performed (this is not likely if the examination is undertaken 1
month after the last mating)
[b]
 in small litters the conceptuses may be obscured by intestine (gas)
Overestimation of fetal numbers
this may occur because of:
[a]
subsequent resorption (most common) [4]
[b]
counting the same conceptus twice
Underestimation of fetal numbers
 this is very likely, particularly in litters of greater than four

14.1
ENDOCRINE CONTROL
 the duration of whelping (parturition) is usually quite protracted in the bitch
and its endocrine control is poorly understood
 the trigger for the timing of parturition is likely to involve the maturation of
the fetal pituitary-adrenal axis at the completion of fetal development
 maternal cortisol concentrations rise just before parturition but their role is
not fully understood
 oestrogens, oxytocin and relaxin are probably involved in the initiation of
parturition, but the most likely trigger is prostaglandin which increases in
blood 36 hours pre-partum and probably causes luteolysis and the precipitous
decline in progesterone
· prior to this progesterone concentrations have been slowly declining through-
out the latter part of pregnancy whist oestrogen concentrations are maintained
or slightly increase
 a precipitous decrease in progesterone is the final trigger for a change in oes-
 trogen: progesterone ratio which is the major endocrine event associated with
the initiation of parturition
the decrease in progesterone generally occurs 24-36 hours before the onset of
parturition
the decrease in progesterone correlates with a fall in body temperature (pro-
gesterone is thermogenic and its withdrawal results in a decrease in tempera-
 t x s   , s s

prolactin concentrations rise during the latter part of pregnancy and peak

14.2 PREPARATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
(Figure 14.1)
careful acclimatization and familiarization of the bitch with the area that she
 is expected to use for whelping is sensible in the last 2 weeks before parturition 
is expected
there is no single perfect whelping area but the following should be
considered:
[a]
 there should be human comforts including a chair, hot and cold water
and telephone access with important telephone numbers
[b]
the room is best isolated by a baby gate and door
[c]
the area should be clean and be capable of being kept clean
[d]
preferably a separate whelping box should be used with a rail on the inside
to prevent pups from being squashed
e]
the box should be well constructed to avoid drafts as these can cause
chilling of the neonates
[f}
the sides of the box should be low enough to facilitate the bitch getting
 a  a ai on sm as m sd an  
a wall-mounted shelf that the bitch can climb onto but the puppies cannot
g)
it is helpful if one side is removable so that when pups are old enough
they can be allowed access into the main room
[h]
the box should be large enough to allow the bitch to be fully extended in
any direction which she lies down
NB: It is critical that infectious diseases are not introduced into the whelping area;
these are most likely to be introduced on the shoes of visitors, or when visitors
handle pups after touching other dogs. Use of overshoes, hand washing and
alcohol hand gel should all be considered for visitors.

139
Temperature
 artificial heat may be provided, but the bitch should be a good source of
warmth
heat may be provided by a hot water botle wrapped in a towel, via floor
heating or commonly via heat lamps
initially a temperature of about 26°C is ideal, but if overhead heating is sup-
plied, ensure that the bitch cannot burn (she will be closer to the lamp than
the pups)
Bedding
 provision of material which is easily removed and disposed of when soiled (e.g.
fleecy bedding)
 a thick bed of newspaper is ideal as the top layers can be removed as
necessary
Quietness
the whelping box should be in the corner of a room or, better still, in a separate
room
 this prevents the bitch from being unwittingly disturbed during whelping
 do not invite the neighbours in to watch
14.3 EQUIPMENT
 it is sensible that the whelping area is stocked with equipment that will be
needed or may be needed during a normal but assisted delivery, this will save
time and stress at a later date
General equipment
 newpaper and clean bedding

Equipment for the pups

14.4 PREPARATION OF THE BITCH
Before mating
ensure routine vaccination status is up-to-date so that there are adequate anti-
bodies present in the bitch's colostrum
ensure that the bitch is treated for endoparasites and ectoparasites
ensure that any gingivitis is treated (by descaling teeth if necessary)
At the time of mating
 if infectious disease is present in the dog or bitch consider artificial insemina-
tion if this is allowed
 any other disease of a possibly infectious nature should be treated
vaccination and parasite treatments can still be administered if this was not
done previously, but the window of time shortly after mating (during organo-
genesis should be avoided)
consider the use of canine herpes virus vaccination if there is concern about
St  si  ae a   si  sn axa assos
until 7 days after mating, with a second dose administered at approximately
day 55 of pregnancy
Treatments during pregnancy
 the author prefers to administer no drugs during pregnancy if at all possible;
 lists of therapeutic agents with minimal effect upon the developing embryo and
fetus are available and should be consulted before any drug is administered
drug administration should, however, be avoided during organogenesis if
possible

do not force extra food on the bitch; it is rarely necessary to increase the volume
of food before about 40 days of pregnancy
 feed small amounts and often

 prevent mobilization of calcium at parturition leading to inertia (see 22.1) or
eclampsia (see 22.15)
introduce the bitch to the whelping area at least 2 weeks before expected par
 turition and get her used to sleeping there
monitor mammary development in the last week; if this appears inadequate,
or if nipple numbers are low compared with the expected size of the litter, have
milk supplements on hand
to make the nipples more accessible and from the perineum and back legs to
make cleaning the bitch easier after whelping
Temperature monitoring
 start taking the bitch's rectal temperature about 1 week before the expected
whelping date
 temperature should be taken at least three times a day
 normal temperature is about 38 *C (100.5 °F) during late pregnancy
 a fall below 37.5 *C (99.5 °F) indicates that parturition should start within 24
hours (Figure 14.2)
the temperature drop may only be transient, but if temperature is taken three
times daily, a single low reading may be due to incorrect procedure
 if no signs of whelping occur within 48 hours after the temperature fall, the
bitch may be suffering from primary uterine inertia (see 22.1) and may require
a caesarean operation
 temperature monitoring is essential in bitches known to be carrying small (one

Progesterone monitoring
 in normal whelpings this is often unnecessary
however when there is concern about when parturition is due the measurement
of plasma progesterone is very useful since this decreases just before the onset
of parturition
in the author's clinic we have shown that simple ELISA techniques can be used
to accurately predict the onset of parturition [2]; these findings have wide clini-
cal applications in monitoring of normal and suspected abnormal whelpings

NB: Progesterone monitoring during oestrus can also be used to predict the onset
of parturition which occurs approximately 61 days after high progesterone has
been detected.
14.5 THE'OVERDUE' BITCH
 pregnancy length is remarkably consistent at 62-64 days from ovulation
however, when measured from first or last matings, pregnancy lengths can be
very variable (Figure 14.3)
 longer than expected pregnancies can be due to:

14.6 FIRST STAGE PARTURITION
for 2-3 days before parturition bitches are often restless, seek seclusion and
eat less food, possibly in response to elevated prolactin concentrations
the beginning of first stage cannot be accurately recognized unless the bitch is
carefully monitored
during this time, which is the preparation for the expulsive (second) stage, there
 hu si yq a  uaas aq saos ueo asau isuoon au ar
lateral recumbency, otherwise a monitoring device is required to measure
uterine activity (tochodynomometery)
 it is important to differentiate uterine contractions (onset of first stage) from
abdominal contractions (onset of second stage); this is easy
using
a
tochodynomometer where uterine contractions are measured in mmHg
uterine contractions initially are not very frequent and the cervix is closed;
some bitches are more upset by these contractions than others
the onset of uterine contractions is closely related to the fall in circulating
progesterone concentration
144
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 gradually the contractions appear to become more intense and frequent as a
 pup is being pushed towards the dilating cervix
 as first stage parturition progresses there is a gradual increase in the uterine
contractions; these increase from one short-duration contraction per hour to
approximately one contraction every 10 minutes
 the time at which the cervix dilates fully cannot be ascertained because the
bitch's vagina is relatively long and the cervix is unlikely to be reached by
digital examination
 the allantochorion of the first pup ruptures in the vagina; the presence of a pup
and its fluid and membranes in the vagina usually stimulates abdominal strain-
ing, although some pups are born with very little evidence of this
the beginning of straining, or the appearance of fetal fluid or a pup at the vulva,
marks the change from first to second stage parturition
uterine contractions during frst stage parturition may cause:
[a]
restlessness
[b]
 anorexia
[c)
panting and a ‘worried look'
(P)
shivering
[e]
nesting behaviour
[f}
looking at the flanks
[g]
vulval licking
[h)
vomiting if recently fed
[i]
swelling and relaxation of the vulva
appearance of mucus at the vulva
[k]
abdominal relaxation which allows easier palpation of the fetuses
NB: The length of first stage parturition (0-36 hours), intensity and behavioural
characteristics are very variable, even in successive pregnancies in the same bitch.
There is usually milk in the mammary glands throughout first stage parturition.
14.7 SECOND STAGE PARTURITION
uterine contractions increase in frequency and amplitude and when using a
 tochodynomometer abdominal contractions can be seen superimposed on
 n         s 
contractions
in normal second stage there is continuation of uterine contractions in the
background throughout parturition; infrequent and low-amplitude uterine con-
tractions are seen in bitches with abnormal parturition
usually the amnion (water bag) of the first pup is seen at the vulva soon after
abdominal straining begins
passage of the head through the vulva may cause signs of pain in primigravida,

and limbs extended rostrally. The pups move upwards to the pelvic inlet (a) and then
downwards through the vagina, vestibule and vulva (b).
 pups can only be born normally in longitudinal presentation, i.e. the long axis
of the puppy is paralll to the long axis of the bitch (see 22.5)
 anterior presentation (with the pup's head born first) is most common, but
posterior presentations occur so frequently as to be accepted as normal;
 however, obstructive dystocia may be caused by posterior presentation of the
firstpup
 the position of the pup during normal birth is dorsal, i.e. the back of the pup
is uppermost, towards the back of the dam; this allows the natural curve of
 - an s ii aso paa an m pdsn oi ads sdnd a
upwards into the bitch's pelvis then downwards through the vulva (Figure 14.4)
 the posture of the pup is a description of the disposition of its head and legs;
the legs may be either extended or flexed during normal parturition, but in
anterior presentation the head and neck must be extended, i.e. the nose is
leading, or obstruction will occur
a breach birth is a posterior presentation with the hind limbs flexed, i.e. the
feet are extended forward and the tail is seen first
 after the birth of the pup the bitch will lick and rupture the amnion, and rupture

NB: It is important to ensure that excess nibbling, especially at the umbilicus,
does not occur; this may result in an umbilical hernia or the bitch eating part of
the pup.
● the allantochorion (see 12.4) (placenta or afterbirth) may be expelled at a vari-
able time after the pup, and some pups are born within it; a second pup may
follow before the expulsion of the first allantochorion
 the bitch will usually attempt to eat the allantochorion; it is not necessary that
she does so and it will probably cause her to develop diarrhoea
 the interval between the delivery of successive pups is very variable
 delivery from each horn is usually alternate
146
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
it is often difficult to decide when a problem has arisen; as a rough guide
unproductive straining for 30 minutes may indicate an obstruction, although
a normal pup may be born after this time
 if more pups are expected and the bitch is restless, will not let the pups suck
for long, but is not straining, 2-3 hours may elapse without trouble ensuing

14.8THIRD STAGE PARTURITION
this terminology is *borrowed’ from other species where classically third stage
parturition refers to the passage of the allantochorion after second stage par-
turition is complete
 in the bitch this process occurs throughout the second stage and cannot be
simply defined
however, involution of the empty uterus could be said to constitute a third
stage, although its duration would be hard to define
14.9 INDUCTION OF PARTURITION
 there are few indications for induction of parturition in the bitch, although on
occasion it may be warranted when there is inter-current disease affecting the
bitch
there are reports of using pharmacological induction of parturition to achieve
whelping at a specific time when additional human assistance may be arranged
overall induction of parturition to a reliable time is only moderately successful
and should only be attempted when the bitch has reached 95% of normal
pregnancy length and when constant supervision can be provided after drug
administration
 the most effective regimes appear to be the administration of progesterone
receptor antagonists (e.g. aglepristone) followed by repeated does of
oxytocin
 administration of long duration corticosteroids have been said to initiate par-
turition, but since they are given at a time when whelping is expected anyway,
assessment of results is difficult
Oxytocin may stimulate uterine contractions in cases of primary uterine inertia
if it is felt sure that the cervix has relaxed; this can only be evaluated adequately
by endoscopic examination
14.10 CARE OF THE BITCH AFTER PARTURITION
 at the end of parturition the bitch will be tired and her perineum will be soiled
 she should be offered water to drink and gross contamination should be
washed away; after an hour or so when the pups are settled she should be
Normal Whelping
147
moved out of the whelping box but allowed to see the pups whilst her perineum
is cleaned and dried
 for the first few days the bitch may not wish to leave the pups and so she should
be offered food and water whilst in the whelping box, but she should be taken
out regularly to urinate and defecate; exercise is important to encourage reduc-
tion in size of the uterus and pushing out of uterine fluid
 some maiden bitches may not adequately stimulate the pups to urinate and
defecate, so she should be encouraged to lick the pups to do this; some advocate
application of a little honey to the pup's perineum

Care of Neonatal Puppies
15.1
PHYSIOLOGY AND HUSBANDRY
 immediately after birth puppies have immature physiological responses when
compared with adults:
[a]
 they have limited ability to regulate or control body temperature
[b]
 they have poor control of fluid balance or energy levels
[c]
 their immune system is not completely developed
[d]  t
 they may display irregular respiratory patterns
 each of these affect their susceptibility and response to disease and this results
 in a high mortality rate seen in commercial kennels (10-30%), especially within
the first 3 weeks of life
 importantly, however, mortality rates can be significantly reduced with appro-
priate monitoring and care
after birth pups are entirely reliant upon the dam; they are born with their eyes
and external ear canals closed, they have limited smell and relatively low
myelination of nerve fibres
the eyes begin to open at 10-14 days and the external ear canal at 14-16 days,
with cells sloughing off from the ear canal for 1 week after the canal opens
 pups have limited locomotion ability - restricted to simple ^rooting? behaviour 
(a scrabbling of the fore limbs to provide forward motion and a circular move-
ment of the head in attempt to locate a nipple) which can result in them becom-
ing stuck in corners unless moved by the dam
15.2 BEHAVIOUR
the early behavioural periods of the pup are closely linked to the underlying
physiology; the periods are defined as (1) neonatal, and (2) transitional, and
these precede the socialization period (see 1.1).

Care of Neonatal Puppies
149
The neonatal period
 this extends from birth until the pups open their eyes
during this time the pup is predominantly sleeping, whilst sucking and voiding
account for only 10-20% of time
 the pup is totally dependent upon the dam and can react to stimuli (such as
warmth) but do so only by the rooting response noted above
voiding of faeces and urine only occurs following stimulation of the perineum
by the dam licking this area
The transitional period
extends from approximately 10 days until 4 weeks of age
there is progressive myelination of the nervous system, the pups can now expe-
rience pain, see, hear, and progressively they are able to move their hind limbs
locomotion ability increases and the pups start to explore the nest, follow the
dam and play with each other
there are increased periods of wakefulness which can account for 40% of time
15.3 APPEARANCE OF THE NORMAL HEALTHY
NEONATAL PUP (Figure 15.1)
 has a round and full abdomen and skin that is warm and elastic
sucks enthusiastically for a short period approximately every 2-3 hours
birth weight should increase by 5-10% per day; rate of weight gain has been
linked to survival, and daily weight gain should be monitored to allow quick
identification of any puppies who are at risk
spend approximately 80% of their time sleeping with an activated sleep pattern
(twitching movements when asleep)

feeding times but otherwise are asleep.

thereafter
 have an irregular respiratory rate: 10-20 breaths per minute which increases
after the first few days
have a high heart rate: 150-220 beats per minute which increases after the first
few days
15.4(
CARE OF NEONATES AFTER PARTURITION
 immediately after parturition the dam should sever the umbilical cord and lick
the puppy to remove the fetal membranes; this encourages respiration and
the bitch should then encourage the pup to move to the teat and suck
assistance may be necessary where the dam does not or cannot exhibit these
behaviours and can include:
a]
removal of fetal membranes and fluid from the mouth and nose using a
dry towel, bulb syringe or pipette
[b]
 encouraging fluid to drain away by holding the puppy cupped in the hand
with the head tilted downward and hind quarters elevated whilst support-
ing the head and neck (pups should not be swung to clear the airway as
this can result in brain trauma)
[c]
 rubbing the puppy briskly to help stimulate breathing and to warm and
dry the pup
[d]
 artificial respiration if there are less than 10 breaths per minute; use of
oxygen via intubation or tracheotomy can be very helpful
[f}
clamping and severing the umbilical cord 1 cm from the abdomen and
treating with diluted chlorhexidine
Clinical examination
 once the puppies are stabilized they should be sexed, weighed and checked for
congenital abnormalities such as anal atresia, limb deformities, cleft palate and
 harelip, which can affect between 1% and 15% of newborn puppies depending
on the breed
Reducing hypothermia
 pups are wet after birth and at risk of hypothermia; this risk can be reduced
by adequate drying, ensuring energy intake, providing a proper nest area,
encouraging huddling and providing external heat sources
even in ideal situations it can take 5 hours before their body temperature
returns to normal (Figure 15.2)

Hours after Birth
Figure 15.2  Pups rapidly lose heat after birth and it can be 5 hours before they return to a
normal body temperature; it is critical all is done during this time to avoid additional heat
loss.
· the ideal environment is a temperature of 30-33°C in the first 24 hours, 26-
 28 °C in the first week and lower temperatures thereafter; it is helpful for the
nest area to be controlled at this temperature but for there to be cooler areas
that the bitch can escape to
 bedding should be changed frequently to ensure it is clean and dry
Ensuring energy intake
 pups are born with low glycogen reserves and poor body fat reserves with little
 ability to generate energy and so they can be predisposed to hypoglycaemia in
the first 15 days of life
 the first milk, called colostrum, provides high levels of antibodies and energy
ensuring that puppies suck soon after birth can help prevent hypoglycaemia,
especially following hypothermia or hypoxia
the availability of teats, poor milk production, an inexperienced, difficult or ill 
dam, weak pups or continual disturbance by humans can all affect food intake
alternative sources of colostrum, including commercially available products,
should be provided in these cases
Ensuring normal growth and identifying sick pups
 pups that are normal grow at a rapid and predictable rate; this can easily be
monitored by assessing the weight of the pups on a daily basis
 daily weighing requires that each pup is uniquely identifiable and use of marks
 placed on ears or different places on the tail using nail varnish or marker pens
facilitates this
daily weighing seems onerous but is the best way to identify pups that are not
feeding well and are predisposed to becoming ill
152
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Ensuring voiding
until puppies are 3 weeks old there is no voluntary control of urination or
defecation and this is stimulated by the dam licking the perineal area
the dam should be observed to ensure she is fulfilling this function
Preventative healthcare
 should have included immunization of bitches before breeding or during preg-
nancy (for canine herpes virus) to provide passive immunity in colostrum 
de-worming programme should start at 3 weeks of age and progress after
weaning (see 1.2)
Artificial rearing
 may be required in large litters where the dam has insufficient teats or milk,
where there is inadequate milk production, where the dam is a poor mother
or due to death of the dam
in some cases it is possible to foster some or all pups to another bitch that has
lost her pups or has a small litter
 pups in large liters may be rotated between artificial rearing and being reared
by the dam, allowing them to stay in the nest which will allow adequate
socialization
 in cases where the dam dies during birth, colostrum can be expressed from the
bitch or canine colostrum from a commercially available or frozen source
should be administered
commercially available milk replacements are advised when the mother's milk
is inadequate or unavailable and should be fed at a temperature of 37-38*C;
the total volume to be fed is based on puppy weight and growth and be evenly
divided across feedings every 3 hours in the frst week with the interval gradu-
ally increased to every 6-8 hours by 4 weeks of age
if puppies will not suck, milk can be administered via orogastric tube or feeding
bottle; all food should be fed at the appropriate temperature, best measured
with a thermometer and not by sprinkling on the back of a hand
Bottle feeding
commercially available bottles and teats are preferred; they are more efficient
and introduce less gas into the stomach than trying to feed from a syringe or
using a dropper bottle
 bottles should be sterilized between use and commercially available chemical
sterilization for human baby utensils works well
 do not enlarge the nipple hole as, whilst this makes feeding faster, pups swallow
a lot of air and their stomachs become distended; worse still the pups can
aspirate milk and this results in development of bronchopneumonia
Care of Neonatal Puppies
153
 it is easiest to hold the pup on your lap and hold its head elevated to allow it
to suck from the bottle; the pup will normally paddle its front feet as a normal
response during sucking
it can be difficult to be sure of the exact volume of food taken by each pup
Tube feeding
 feeding by orogastric tube is quick, effective and allows the exact amount of
food administered to be recorded
 normally a 6 French gauge soft plastic feeding tube with a rounded end is used
the tube is placed alongside the pup and the distance between the mouth and
the last rib is marked on the tube; % of this distance is the length that will be
 placed into the pup
the pup is best restrained on your lap and the tube is pushed gently into the
pup's mouth; most pups will swallow the tube and it can be seen running down
the left side of the neck (in the oesophagus)
 when neonates are being reared artificially, urination and defecation must be
initiated after every meal by stimulating of the perineal region with cotton wool
(Figure 15.3)
 the urine produced by well hydrated puppies should be colourless
Starting weaning
 solid foods can be introduced starting at 3 weeks of age by mixing puppy food
with the milk formula and allowing it to soften
this *gruel can be offered in small amounts four times a day; in many cases it
is easiest to feed from a finger to get the pup's interest and then to place the
finger into the gruel
Figure 15.3 In pups that are being artificially reared the perineal region needs to be
stimulated to initiate urination and defecation.
154
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 as the pup gets older less milk can be used so the gruel is stiffened into a *paste';
usually no milk substitute is used at about 6 weeks of age
 as the dam is gradually removed from the pups they will start to play and rest
together and will not be stressed by her absence; some pups settle better if they
 have an upended cardboard box in which to sleep
· pups should be encourage to establish a toileting area away from the sleeping
area; here the paper can be replaced regularly
 all pups should be regularly handled, including opening their mouths, looking
in their ears and exposing them to different sounds (see 1.1)

Abnormalities of the Female
16.1
VULVA
Stenosis of the vulval opening
this is rare condition where the vulval opening is too small
this should be identified as part of a normal pre-breeding examination and, if
not, it is noticed when the male is unable to penetrate at coitus and there is
often coital pain affecting the female and sometimes the male
surgical correction is not difficult and involves enlargement and suturing the
mucosa to skin to pre vent re-sealing
Perivulval skin fold dermatitis (Figure 16.1)
this is relatively common in entire bitches and those that have been neutered
either before or after the first oestrus
 sometimes incorrectly referred to as juvenile vulva’ or 'vulval hypoplasia';
close inspection shows the vulva to be of normal size, but is either partially of
completely hidden by folds of adjacent skin
 a large fold of skin dorsal to the vulva is responsible for the problem; often
this is a crescent-shaped fold arising dorsal and lateral to the vulva
 an exudative dermatitis may develop in the skin folds surrounding the vulva;
this is exacerbated by the bitch licking the area and by urine scalding

make examination very diffcult in the conscious animal because of the discom-
fort it causes
conservative treatment consists of parenteral corticosteroids and antibiotics or
 locally applied anti-inflammatory creams; application of the latter is usually
not well tolerated
permanent treatments involve surgical ablation of the diseased skin and vulval
lps with eradication of the sulci around the vulva

Transmissible venereal tumour (Figure 16.2)
present throughout the world with the exception of some island countries
the tumour is caused by seeding of neoplastic cells which are transmitted during
coitus
 verucose tumours arise in and around the genital tract
 not uncommonly there is seeding into the nasal cavity as the bitch licks the
tumours
they may be removed surgically or the bitch can be treated with a cytotoxic
agent, e.g. vincristine

Abnormalities of the Female
159
16.2 VESTIBULE
Congenital constrictions
these can occur just inside the vulval lips
usually digital examination reveals this fibrous bands running within the vulval
lips
 in some cases there is trapping of material within the vestibule and vagina and
a secondary bacterial overgrowth
txamination may be resented by the bitch but under general anaesthesia these
constrictions can usually be dilated manually; recurrence is rare and there is
not normally any obstruction at the time of parturition
Enlargement of the clitoris
this may occur either congenitally (see intersexuality) or due to administration
of androgens (see 18.4 and 27.3)
frequently the clitoris develops a bone running along its long axis (os clitoris)
similar to the os penis noted in the male
the presence of an os clitoris frequently causes pain when the bitch sits down,
 or causes a vestibulitis resulting in excessive licking
 in some cases, if the problem is managed (e.g. by gonadectomy), as the bitch
  e    e    e 
disappear
 in other cases it is necessary to undertake a clitoridectomy; in such cases it is
necessary to establish to route of the urethra which may rarely run within the
clitoris
Lymphoid hyperplasia (small nodules)
small raised usually white nodules may be present within the vestibular or
vaginal mucosa
these nodules are sometimes traumatized at mating and may then bleed
the nodules are probably a result of increased bacterial load for a variety of
different reasons and are more commonly seen when there is intercurrent
disease that allows bacterial overgrowth (e.g. vestibular constrictions)
it has been suggested that these lesions are caused by an unknown virus, but
this does not appear to be likely
the lesions do not affect fertility (see 17.2)
 the appearance of the nodules can be easily differentiated from the vesicles seen 
with canine herpes virus infection
Canine herpes virus vesicles (see 21.5)
some bitches exposed to canine herpes virus demonstrate vesicular lesions
(often with submucosal haemorrhage) within the vagina and vestibule
160
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
these vesicles are initially fluid-flled (and are not solid like the pale-coloured
lymphoid hyperplasia) before becoming eroded and leaving ulcer-like lesions
viral recrudescence is a concern since lesions occur during oestrus and preg-
nancy, and may infect the male at the time of mating and puppies at
parturition
overall, however, mating is not the most common route of infection which is
via the respiratory route
16.3 VAGINA
Strictures/stenosis
abnormal development of the vagina is not uncommon at the junction of the
vestibule and vagina
 most commonly lesions are found just cranial to the urethral opening
the most common lesion appears to be a dorso-ventral vaginal band; if this is
 a si anss yo pq aui sai aos u 1q sa uaq aq A i y
requiring an episiotomy approach or may not be amenable to surgical
correction
 less commonly simple thin membrane constrictions which appear to be rem-
nants of the hymen are found and these can easily be broken under general
anaesthesia
some cases have substantial narrowing of the vestibulo-vaginal junction associ-
ated with circumferential fibrous bands; these are more resistant to stretching
and may continue forward some length along the vagina; these may be difficult
to correct surgically, even via an episiotomy
five aetiologies have been described:
[a]
 the result of hypoplasia of the genital canal which causes vestibulo-vaginal
hypoplasia and a vaginal stricture of some length
[b]
 n s  e        
urogenital sinus causing annular fibrous strictures at this site
[c]
tissue vestiges remaining at the vestibulo-vaginal junction resulting in
hymenal remnants or a complete hymen
[d]
incomplete fusion of the two Mullerian ducts which may result in a double
vagina or a vertical fbrous division within the vagina
[e]
imperfect joining of the genital folds and genital swellings resulting in
vestibulo-vulval hypoplasia
the extent and position of these lesions may be determined by contrast radio-
graphic examination of the vagina
NB: Important research was conducted at the author's clinic which showed
that bitches with severe abnormalities that could only be corrected by an epi-
siotomy approach had lower pregnancy rate and greater whelping complica-
tions than bitches with mild abnormalities [1]; these data influence clinical
Abnormalities of the Female
161
 practice since it cannot be recommended to treat and breed from bitches with
severe abnormalities.
Hyperplasia of the vaginal mucosa (sometimes associated with
protrusion) (Figure 16.3)
In some bitches with a normal endocrine environment there is substantial hyper-
plasia of the vaginal wall during pro-oestrus and oestrus.
 it is not clear why this occurs in some bitches and not others
 in some bitches it occurs at the first oestrus, in others at a later oestrus
sequentially there appears to be a tongue-shaped thickening of the ventral
vaginal wall just cranial to the external urethral orifice; this enlarges when
Oestrogen is elevated (pro-oestrus and oestrus) and regresses later in the luteal
phase; sometimes the enlargement is so pronounced that there is protrusion of
the mass of hyperplastic tissue
some cases present because of pain at attempted coitus; others present because
of the protrusion
 less commonly the entire circumference of the vaginal wall is affected resulting
in a tubular mass of hyperplastic tissue that may also protrude
 e  issd q o s i  a  i
oestrus, although in some cases significant enlargement with protrusion is
found at the pubertal oestrus
[a]
Figure 16.3 Vaginal hyperplasia and protrusion: (a) protrusion of the floor of the vagina;
(b) protrusion of the whole circumference of the vagina.
162
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 the condition appears to be common in certain breeds (bullmastiffs) and certain
lines within breeds
when there is protrusion of the hyperplastic vagina the urethra is pulled cau-
dally and the external urethral orifice (which is found on the ventral surface
of the protrused tissue) ends outside of the vulval lips; this may cause urinary
incontinence
Treatment
conservative treatment of the hyperplastic and protruding tissue is needed to
reduce trauma
 in the majority of cases this is followed by spontaneous resolution after the
end of oestrus
ovariectomy (ovariohysterectomy) will prevent recurrence of oestrus and there-
fore prevent the hyperplasia from developing again
bitches intended for breeding find mating difficult - the dog tends to introduce
his penis ventral to the tissue (Figure 16.3) and not into the vaginal cavity
surgical removal may be considered and must be carried out during oestrus,
when the full extent of the protrusion can be seen; visualization and control
of haemorrhage are easiest if an episiotomy is performed first; care must be
taken not to damage the urethra and this must be catheterized throughout the
surgery
the bitch can be mated at the oestrus following surgery; recurrence of the
condition is uncommon after surgical excision
Vaginal tumours
these are seen almost exclusively in entire bitches
 most cases are benign (fibromata, fibroleiomata, etc) and are often called polyps
 because they are pedunculated
 presenting signs are appearance of the polyp at the vulval lips, or haemorrhage
due to ulceration of the surface
surgical removal is usually feasible but may require episiotomy
occasionally malignant tumours occur under the vaginal epithelium; they most
commonly originate in the urethra
Vaginitis (see 5.5)
Definitions
 distinguishing between normal and abnormal vulval discharge can be difficult;
a mucous and slightly purulent discharge is common at many stages of the
cycle
Abnormalities of the Female
163
identifying the source of vulval discharge can be diffcult and the urinary tract
should always be examined in any investigation
 defining vaginitis in the bitch is almost impossible because all bitches have a
normal bacterial flora and have neutrophils in the vaginal smear (except during
oestrus)
a reasonable definition would be persistence of a copious purulent malodour
ous vulval discharge which may be associated with inflammation of the vaginal
wall and irritation; some cases will also develop a secondary lymphoid

Diagnosis of vulval discharge
in many cases the cause is obvious
vaginal smears will distinguish pro-oestrus and oestrus from other causes (5.5)

be a more significant finding than a mixed growth, however primary bacterial
vaginitis is very rare (except in countries where Brucella canis is present)
· in most cases there is a primary cause which is not bacterial and it is important
to try to indentify this:
[a]
 vaginoscopic examination is the most useful tool as it enables direct visu-
alization of the reproductive tract and urinary tracts
{b)
 radiographic contrast studies may reveal constrictions, tumours, foreign
bodies and ectopic ureters
Pre-pubertal or juvenile vaginitis
 probably the most common cause of vaginitis is seen in the pre-pubertal bitch
such cases may occur as early as 8 weeks of age when a copious creamy dis-
charge develops
 there are no generalized signs of malaise
 may contain the normal bacterial flora or very few bacteria
often more epithelial cells than neutrophils in the smear
 it is assumed that these cases have poor mucosal immunity which allows the
overgrowth of commensal bacteria

Atropbic'vaginitis
in some older bitches that have been neutered for many years a clinical syn
drome similar to juvenile vaginitis develops
 in these cases no underlying cause is identified following standard work-up
it is assumed that the aetiology is similar; poor mucosal immunity as a result
of an absence of oestrogen
these cases can be managed by topical or systemic oestrogens
Vaginal cysts
 these rare congenital abnormalities result from incomplete development of the
 para-mesonephric or Mullerian ducts
they cause a substantial mass effect within the vagina which may interfere with
breeding

16.5
UTERUS
Aplasia
 congenital absence of the uterus is uncommon and when this occurs it is not
 uncommon for only a portion of the uterus to be affected
if there is normal uterus proximal to an aplastic portion, secretions can accu-
mulate and cause considerable enlargement of the uterus, which is usually
asymptomatic (because there is no bacterial involvement)
aplasia of one entire horn is called uterus unicornis
Abnormalities of the Female
165
aplasia will cause reduced fertility since oocytes and sperm cannot meet on the
affected side
aplasia will result in sterility if it affects the uterine body, or both horns
where there is suspicion of aplasia either laparoscopic examination or hyster-
ography performed during oestrus can be diagnostic; some veterinary surgeons
will resort to laparotomy (it is not always possible to image along the whole
length of the normal uterine horn with ultrasound and so this has limited
diagnostic ability)
Cystic endometrial hyperplasia
duringmetoestrus
S (dioestrus) progesterone causes a thickening of the
endometrium and massive development of the endometrial glands (see 2.6)
 normal size and appearance of the uterus when examined with ultrasound has
been described from work conducted in the author's clinic [2]
during anoestrus both these changes subside and there is some desquamation
of epithelial tissue; however, the endometrium remains thicker than it was
before puberty
with succeeding cycles there is progressive permanent thickening of the
endometrium and uterine glands become distended (cystic)
tarly cases of cystic endometrial hyperplasia cause no clinical signs; grossly the
uterus is thickened (1 cm or more in diameter) and appears to be twisted (Figure
16.4a)
at this early stage cystic endometrial hyperplasia may, however, be associated
with infertility
 the condition can be diagnosed using real-time ultrasound examination during
the luteal phase (Figure 16.4b)
bitches with cystic endometrial hyperplasia may have delayed clearance of
uterine fluid after mating [3], and there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that

bacterial contamination that occurs as a result of the retained fluid)
 it seems likely that administration of progesterone receptor antagonists to block
the action of progesterone during one luteal phase may allow some resolution
of the pathology which may increase fertility at the subsequent cycle, although
this contention has yet to be proven
Endometritis
 there is no convincing evidence that “low-grade’ endometritis causes clinical
signs in the bitch
 however in our clinic we have shown that bitches with cystic endometritis have
greater numbers of luminal polymorphonuclear neutrophils after mating that
do normal bitches [4]; and furthermore that this is associated with lower preg-
nancy rate and litter size
in our studies we demonstrated that a 4-day course of broad-spectrum systemic
antibiotic (for example potentiated sulphonamide) commencing immediately
after mating could improve pregnancy rate and litter size in these bitches
 this suggests that bacterial contamination of the hyperplastic uterus may occur
at oestrus
Pyometra (Figure 16.5) [5]
Aetiology
the vagina has a normal resident bacterial flora (see 5.10)
during oestrus the cervix relaxes and these bacteria are able to enter the uterus,
especially during mating
usually the defence mechanism of the uterus is competent at eliminating these
 bacteria, or some mechanism in the cervix (possibly mucus) may prevent their
entry
 however, if bacteria do enter the uterus, the elevated blood progesterone con-
centrations at this time may reduce the speed of the inflammatory response (as
 in other species)
 in particular in bitches with cystic endometrial hyperplasia (i.e. older bitches)
there seems to be reduced ability to eliminate these bacteria which may survive
in the cyst fluid
the growth of bacteria in the uterus eventually stimulates accumulation of
inflammatory exudate, including large numbers of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils
the organism usually isolated from these cases is Escherichia coli, some strains
of which may be more pathogenic than others; streptococci and other bacteria
may also be present

 pathogencity appears to be related to the adherent ability of bacteria and com-
 monly the uropathogenic organisms are isolated
some cases of pyometra are said to be sterile; this may be related to the time
of investigation, or because the samples collected were incorrectly handled
before culture
accumulation of pus in the uterus is eventually followed by the absorption of
bacterial toxins into the circulation and signs of toxaemia
 in the author's laboratory we have documented changes in oestrogen and pro-
 gesterone receptors in the uterus of bitches with pyometra compared with
normal bitches, and it is likely that this is involved in the aetiology of the
condition [6]
 there is no relationship between irregular oestrous cycles and the development
of pyometra
 there is no relationship between pyometra and pseudopregnancy, although both
may occur at the same time
whether or not bitches which have never had a litter are more likely to develop
pyometra is not known
168
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 the administration of synthetic progestogens may, as does endogenous proges-
terone, predispose to pyometra by causing cystic endometrial hyperplasia and
by directly decreasing the resistance of the endometrium to bacterial invasion
(see 27.1)
 to pyometra by keeping the cervix relaxed for longer into the luteal phase than
would normally be the case, and allowing bacterial colonization of the uterus
an additional mechanism caused by local irritation by bacteria causing a tro-
phoblastic reaction has been proposed
 in our laboratory we have shown that irritation of the endometrium can change
the expression of progesterone receptors and this may therefore have some
impact on the development of the condition [7]
Clinical signs
 in some cases the changes are not severe and the bitch has signs of malaise
after oestrus but recovers at the end of the luteal phase; these bitches usually
develop classical signs of pyometra at the subsequent cycle or the one after that
 initially there may be slight pyrexia and depression, but since signs of malaise
are vague they are often not noticed
sometimes the appearance of a purulent discharge at the vulva may precede
signs of toxaemia, but usually the reverse is true
toxaemia causes varying degrees of depression, anorexia, vomiting, polydipsia,
 polyuria and occasionally posterior paresis; when presented the body tempera-
ture may be normal or subnormal
some cases of pyometra are closed, i.e. presumably the cervix is closed and
does not allow the escape of pus, these bitches are often most severely ill
 in many cases, however, the cervix does open and there is release of exudate
 a classical discharge is purulent but may be yellow coloured or red-brown in
nature
despite the vulval discharge the majority of the pus is not expelled and is
retained in the uterus
the relationship between whether pyometra is 'open' or 'closed’ and the loca-
 tion of pus in the uterus is unclear; in some bitches only one horn or part of
one horn may be distended, in others the whole uterus is equally involved, and
in a few there are discrete circular distensions separated by constrictions of the
 uterus, as in mid pregnancy
 in some bitches the distended uterus causes obvious abdominal enlargement
Diagnosis
purulent vaginal discharge accompanied by clinical signs of malaise 4-6 weeks
after oestrus is suggestive; however, the signs of toxaemia may develop before
or after this
Abnormalities of the Female
169
 haematology will reveal a neutrophilia (usually in excess of 20 x 10/litre) with
a 'shift to the left'
radiography may identify a distended uterus causing dorsal displacement of the
colon and cranial displacement of the small intestine; this must be distinguished
from pregnancy (see 13.6)
 real-time ultrasonography will usually reveal a fluid-filled tubular viscus, devoid
of fetal elements; the cranial uterine horn may also be imaged above the caudal
part[8]
palpation of the abdomen may detect uterine enlargement
mammary development does not preclude the possibility of pyometra because
this condition and pseudopregnancy are likely to occur at the same time
laboratory tests may exclude other causes of polydipsia/polyuria, vomiting and
paresis
Surgical treatment
 ovariohysterectomy is the treatment of choice if the bitch has a reasonable
chance of survival; fluid therapy to rehydrate and antibiotics to prevent peri-
tonitis are not optional
Medical treatment
· medical treatment of pyometra is possible, however in many cases there is
recurrence at the next oestrus
·a reasonable prognostic indicator for recurrence is the thickness of the uterine
wall which can be measured with ultrasound; when the uterine wall is greater
than 5 mm in thickness and especially if endometrial cysts are present there is
a high likelihood of recurrence, compared with bitches with a thin endometrium
upon ultrasound examination
 if medical treatment is successful, it is likely that the condition will recur fol-
lowing the next oestrus; it may therefore be prudent to plan to breed the bitch
at the first oestrus after treatment
Prolactin inhibitors combined with prostaglandins (see 27.9)
 daily oral administration of prolactin inhibitors (e.g. cabergoline at 5.0 μg/kg
administered for 10 days) will remove support for the corpora lutea and result
in a decrease in progesterone concentrations; as a result there will be softening
and opening of the cervix, increased uterine contractions, and reduced endome-
trial secretion
 in our clinic we have shown that repeated administration of low-dose prostag-
landin (e.g. cloprostenol at 5.0μg/kg administered on day 3, 6 and 9) during
cabergoline treatment caused active uterine contractions and good clinical
efficacy [9]

 such low doses of prostaglandin produce only short duration and mild adverse
effects (salivation, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, abdominal pain and tachy-
cardia) but should be used with care
 broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should always be administered because
10% of bitches with pyometra are bacteraemic
success rates are high at least for an immediate cure of the problem; on day
10 an ultrasound examination should be performed to ensure that all fluid has
been expelled (Figure 16.6); if fluid remains present the treatment duration
should be lengthened
 fertility rates at the subsequent oestrus are related to the degree of endometrial
abnormality (thickness) which can be assessed using ultrasound examination;
30% of cases recur after the next oestrus
NB: This regime has replaced the use of prostaglandin alone; in particular pros-
taglandin alone should not be used in cases of closed-cervix pyometra because of
the risk of uterine rupture.

 antagonizing the progesterone will result in removal of its effect and the cervix
will soften, there will be increased spontaneous uterine contractions and
reduced endometrial secretion
· in clinical studies the regime produced no adverse effects, and emptying of
uterine fuid occurred quickly, producing resolution of the clinical signs
some of the bitches returned to normal fertility after treatment
NB: It would seem likely that in the future increased efficacy might be achieved
 using aglepristone combined with cloprostenol or cagerboline and cloprostenol.
Haemorrhagic discharge after oestrus
Two syndromes appear to be seen.
Delayed drainage of uterine fluid
 in bitches with vaginal hyperplasia or abnormalities at the vestibule-vaginal
junction there may be trapping of uterine haemorrhagic discharge
this fluid becomes changed in nature and develops a brown colour; it is slowly
discharged over 10 days after oestrus, with the discharge decreasing each day
 no treatment is needed
Metorrbagia
 post-oestrus bleeding is seen in some older bitches
the discharge is dark and unlike that in normal oestrus but continues to be
large in volume
there are no signs of malaise attributable to the condition
 a diagnosis of pyometra is often made, although this is erroneous
Ovariohysterectomy is, however, the only treatment
the removed uterus is slightly enlarged and the ovaries contain *cystic’ struc-
tures; these may be adenomata although the aetiology of the condition requires
further investigation
Uterine tumours
uterine tumours are uncommon
leiomyomata are seen in older bitches
they are rarely associated with clinical signs which if they occur are usually a
haemorrhagic discharge noted at non-oestrus phases of the cycle
ultrasound examination is usually diagnostic demonstrating focal uterine
enlargement and trapped fluid
172
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
16.6
UTERINE TUBES
there is very little information relating to uterine tube abnormalities in the bitch
 a small number of cases of uterine tube inflammation have been demonstrated,
but this does not appear to be common and tubal obstruction appears to be
sufficiently rare to not be considered a differential diagnosis for infertility
 occasional tumours occur
16.7  0VARIES
Ovarian cysts
true ovarian cysts are very rare, and many cases that are *diagnosed’ at the
time of ovariohysterectomy are in fact cystic structures within the ovarian
bursa. Both follicular and luteal cysts may be seen
Follicular cysts
cystic follicles are frequently over-diagnosed based on clinical signs; most
 bitches with prolonged signs of pro-oestrus or oestrus are normal and do not
have ovarian cysts
 true cystic follicles do result in persistent oestrus but a duration of more than
30 days should elapse before diagnostic work-up commences since normal
pro-oestrus and oestrus may last 30 days
ultrasound examination at this time will demonstrate multiple thin-walled
fluid-filled (anechoic) structures often 10-12mm in internal diameter
follicular cysts may be forced to ovulate by the administration of exogenous
 human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) which is LH-like in activity; often daily
or alternate day administration is needed over 3-6 days

the cyst using oral progestogens (e.g. megoestrol acetate) although there is a
risk of pyometra since progesterone is being administered at at time when
endogenous oestrogen concentrations are high
Luteal cysts
 luteal cysts are rare and whilst progesterone is produced the most common
clinical sign is absence of oestrus
 in some cases luteal cysts are identified in bitches with pyometra; it seems likely
that a persistent elevation of progesterone predisposes to pyometra, but this
absolute relationship is unproven
 luteal cysts can be diagnosed by elevated progesterone and presence of single
or multiple thick-walled fluid-filled structures within the ovaries

administration, however there is inadequate evidence for this contention
Ovarian tumours
ovarian tumours are most often diagnosed either because of the endocrine
consequences (production of oestrogen and vague signs of oestrus that wax
and wane) or because of a mass effect and ascites
 granulosa cell tumours are usually associated with persistent or recurrent
 oestrus; both plasma oestrogens and progesterone concentrations are reported
to be elevated
dysgerminomata and teratomata are endocrinologically inactive but may be
suspected if abdominal distention and ascites are present
 adenomata (cyst adenomata) may affect both ovaries but are normally benign
and associated with no clinical signs {their possible association with metor-
rhagia (see 16.5) is unclear)
 diagnosis of ovarian tumours may be made on the basis of clinical signs, palpa-
tion, radiography, ultrasonography and plasma steroid assay
surgical removal is usually effective unless metastases have occurred
care should be taken not to rupture these neoplasms since metastatic spread is
 often by trans-coelomic seeding
16.8 MAMMARY GLAND
Asymetrical mammary glands
 this is common and a normal anatomical variant
Accessory nipples
 these small additional nipples are found on normal mammary glands and may
be functional and connect to the same collecting ducts as the main nipple; milk
will be emitted in the lactating bitch
 most cases need no treatment
Inverted nipples
 in some bitches nipples are inverted and trap waxy material
these may require chronic management care including lubricants and topical
 antibiotics; in other cases the nipple everts and does not cause a problem during
lactation
174
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Hyperplasia of nipples
 a hyperplastic response of the nipple epithelium can be found following chronic
 inflammation associated either with damage during sucking or due to contact
with an irritant cleaning fluid or bedding
 most cases require no treatment but are unsightly; rarely they interfere with
sucking because the teat is too large for the pup's mouth
Fibroadenomatous mammary hyperplasia
hyperplasia of one or two of the caudal mammary glands is occasionally seen
in bitches
 the condition is recognised by a multi-nodular (5-10 mm diameter) fluid-filled
firm to almost spongy enlargement of the glands
 the gland is non-painful but a brown discharge may be present
 it is most commonly seen during the luteal phase and regresses significantly at
the end of the luteal phase
 in the acute situation termination of the luteal phase using prolactin inhibitors,
or blocking the action of progesterone using a progesterone antagonist can
produce a clinical response
surgical neutering prevents recurrence
gland(s)
Mammary gland neoplasia
mammary tumours are common in bitches but are infrequently seen in bitches
that are neutered before puberty or in the first year of life
canine mammary tumours are carcinoma (with six types and additional sub-
types), sarcoma (four types), carcinosarcoma (mixed mammary tumours), or
benign adenoma
 obesity appears to be a risk factor for development of mammary neoplasia
 50% of tumours are malignant and bitches therefore require appropriate
screening (e.g. thoracic radiography, blood biochemistry)
clinical features that increase the suspicion of malignancy include:
[a]
rapid growth of the mass
[b]
poor zone of transition to the adjacent tissue
[c]
a tumour larger than 2.5 cm in diameter
[d]
enlargement of the local lymph node
[e]
oedema of local tissue
the prognosis for most mammary tumours whether benign or malignant is
favourable as long as they receive rapid surgical treatment

small tumours can be removed by nodulectomy followed by histopathological
examination
masses that are 2cm in size may warrant fine-needle aspiration before further
surgical treatment; simple mastectomy will be indicated in well differentiated
tumours whilst block, chain or total mastectomy may be required for poorly
differentiated tumours
 recurrence for poorly differentiated canine mammary tumours is 9o%; for
moderately differentiated tumours, 68%; and for well differentiated tumours
24%
NB: The decision about which mammary gland to remove is dependent upon the
lymphatic drainage from the mammary gland; the most cranial and caudal glands
other glands have lymphatic connections to adjacent glands.
As a general guide for surgery:
Tumour in gland 1
remove gland 1
Tumour gland 2
remove gland 2 and 1
Tumour in gland 3
 remove all glands
Tumour in gland 4
remove gland 4 and 5
Tumour in gland 5
remove gland 5
176
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 Administration of a prolactin inhibitor before surgery can be useful since this
reduces any mammary gland hyperplasia, improves visualization of tumour
edges, reduces tumour size and overall makes the surgery easier
 Ovariohysterectomy or ovariectomy is recommended to prevent development
of new neoplasia
 Triple chemotherapy treatment (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and fluorou-
racil) has been advocated when metastatic spread is confirmed or suspected
16.9
URETHRA
Urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence
 following surgical neutering up to 20% of bitches develop urinary incompe-
tence caused by insufficient closure of the urethral sphincter; bitches show
overflow incontinence often when recumbent
 some bitches develop signs within a few months of surgery, in most it is several
years
 neutered bitches have low plasma concentrations of oestrogen and elevated
concentrations of GnRH, LH and FSH
 medical treatments are aimed at improving sphincter closure either by admin-
istration of:
[a]
tively on alpha-1 receptors, these are present in the bladder neck and
cranial urethra, stimulation causes increased closure pressure. Approxi
mately 75% of bitches respond to alpha-adrenergic drugs
oestogens; drugs such as oestriol sensitize the alpha receptors to other
endogenous hormones and therefore increase urethral closure pressure.
Approximately 65 % of bitches respond to oestrogens, interestingly some-
times these are different bitches to those that respond to alpha-adrenergic
drugs so if one regime fails it is worth trying another
c]
GnRH agonists; depot agonists such as deslorelin implants cause a reduc-
tion in LH and FSH concentrations and in some bitches these produces a
clinical response but the mechanism is not fully elucidated. Approximately
 50% of bitches have some response to GnRH agonist implants
surgical treatments are aimed at changing urethral position or anatomy so that
closure pressure is increased, surgery is normally indicated in cases that are
refractory to medical treatment:
[a]
 colposuspension: the bladder neck and proximal urethra are relocated into
the abdomen by drawing forward the cranial vaginal remnant and anchor-
ing it to the prepubic tendon using nylon sutures
b]
urethropexy: the urethra is relocated into the abdomen and tension on
the urethra increases resistance to flow by drawing forward the urethra
and anchoring it to the prepubic tendon using nylon sutures
[c]
urethral submucosal collagen: the urethral lumen is narrowed by endo-
scopic injection of collagen into the urethral submucosa
Abnormalities of the Female
177
Other urethral abnormalities
these are not common
most frequently seen is transitional cell carcinoma which may be local spread
from the bladder neck; these may present as a potential reproductive tract
problem because clinical signs are usually a persistent haemorrhagic vulval
discharge. These cases require endoscopic examination or a positive contrast
vagino-urethrogram where the neoplasm can usually be readily identified

PREPUCE (SHEATH)
Phimosis
This is constriction of the preputial orifice such that the penis cannot be
exteriorized.
it may occur congenitally or as the result of trauma or inflammation which
results in a secondary fibrous change to the sheath
 in severe cases the preputial orifice is so small that the penile tip cannot be
 protruded and urine cannot escape as it is voided; it accumulates in the sheath
and dribbles thereafter from the preputial opening
these dogs often may either stand with urine dribbling or urinate on the caudal
aspect of their fore legs
affected dogs are not able to copulate and show signs of pain during
erection
 surgical enlargement of the orifice is usually curative
Paraphimosis
This occurs when the penis can be exposed from the sheath, but cannot be
retracted.
 it is not always an absolute disparity between the size of the preputial orifice
and the size of the penis
 in some dogs after normal copulation the penis is slow to return to the sheath,
or causes inversion of the preputial skin and hair; lubrication of the penis with
 a water-soluble gel will aid its return, although the dog may resent manipula-
tion of the penis - failure to help causes paraphimosis 
spinal lesions may also be associated with paraphimosis
foreign bodies may cause paraphimosis

This is persistent enlargement of the penis in the absence of sexual excitement.
 it may be the result of neurogenic abnormalities such as lumbar spinal lesions
 conservative management including repeated replacement of the penis in the

amputation
Short prepuce
In some dogs there is a relative size mismatch between the length of the penis and
the length of the prepuce which results in the distal tip of the penis being exposed

sexuality should be considered (see 18.4)
Urination on the chest and front legs
seen in some King Charles spaniels
 despite lifting a hind leg during urination, urine is deposited on the ventral
thorax and the back of one or both front legs

17.2 PENIS
Penile hypoplasia
 under-development of the penis is extremely rare but reported in certain breeds
may be due to sex chromosome abnormalities
 the clinical signs are related to urine pooling within the prepuce
Hypospadias
 this is opening of the urethra somewhere along the ventral surface of the penis,
and not at its tip; it may be as far back as the anus
six classifications have been described, of which the perineal form is the most
common
invariably this condition occurs in intersex dogs (see 18.4)
 affected dogs may also have a short and deviated penis
 reconstructive surgery or penile amputation may be required
Persistent penile frenulum
this is a band of tissue attaching the ventral surface of the penis to the adjacent
prepuce
 in normal dogs the frenulum has usually disappeared by puberty
if it persists, attempts to extrude the penis from the prepuce may cause pain,
ventral deviation of the penis or haemorrhage if the frenulum ruptures
 surgical section of the frenulum under general anaesthesia may be necessary
a heritable nature has been established in one breed
Haemorrhage
 haemorrhage through the penile integument may occur apparently spontane-
ously or after known trauma, e.g. dog bite
Abnormalities of the Male
181
torn areas of integument rarely heal well and sometimes fistulae develop to the
underlying cavernous tissue so that the lesions leak blood which can be at
substantial pressure during erection
 mattress sutures of fine absorbable material should be used to occlude the lesion
under general anaesthesia
if lesions are refractory to this treatment, the penis should be amputated and
the dog castrated (in order to try to avoid the dog obtaining an erection)
Fracture of the os penis
traumatic injuries to the penis may result in the os becoming fractured
usually there is significant urethral haemorrhage in the early phases and there
may be immediate or later dysuria due to urethral obstruction
diagnosis is by palpation and radiographic examination
treatment initially is to allow healing to occur unaided
indwelling urethral catheters may be useful during the initial healing phase
if callus formation causes urethral constriction, penile amputation or perineal
or scrotal urethrostomy should be considered
Lymphoid hyperplasia
pale 1-2 mm diameter nodules seen at the base of the glans penis close to the
reflection of the sheath, and in some cases lesions are also seen on the inner
 preputial lining
 the condition appears very similar to that noted in bitches
the condition has wrongly been called dog pox'; the lesions are, however, not
vesicles, and on this basis and the pale colour can also be differentiated from
canine herpes virus lesions
lesions are often found incidentally during routine fertility examination often
in dogs where there is a heavy preputial discharge; presumably they occur as
 a result of high commensal bacterial load within the prepuce
occasionally t
these nodules may be abraded during mating or semen
collection
Posthitis
this is inflammation of the penis and appears as congestion-like discoloration
of the penis
it is seen in some dogs which masturbate, or occasionally when trauma occurs
during mating or when semen collection is attempted by an inexperienced
person
 conservative treatment is required in most cases
182
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Balanoposthitis
 inflammation of the penis and the inner preputial lining is very rare
dogs with excessive purulent discharge from the prepuce are often said to have
balanoposthitis (inflammation of the penis and sheath) but this is usually an
erroneous diagnosis because:
[a]
 all entire male dogs have some discharge from the prepuce
[b]
close inspection of the penis and sheath usually reveals no sign of
inflammation
C
swabs and smears of the surface of the penis will reveal macrophages,
polymorphonuclear leucocytes and bacteria, which are all normal
[d]
Ureoplasma and Mycoplasma are normal in the dog prepuce and semen
Preputial discharge
as noted above all dogs have some preputial discharge which is normal; it may
drip from the prepuce or be licked away by the dog (Figure 17.1)
 it is difficult to define excessive discharge; this may depend on the dog's owner,
i.e. what is acceptable in a kennelled dog may not be acceptable in a dog which
sits on furniture
the cause of excessive discharge in dogs which do not have obvious lesions,
e.g. foreign bodies is not known
during routine fertility examinations, quite copious accumulations of pus may
be seen with or without lymphoid hyperplasia and are considered normal
bacteriological culture frequently reveals normal commensal organisms
culture of an antibiotic-resistant bacterium, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or
any other organism in pure culture, may be significant, but this occurs very
rarely
Figure 17.1  Photograph of the sheath of a dog showing the normal volume of preputial
discharge which may drip from the prepuce or be licked away by the dog.
Abnormalities of the Male
183
parenteral treatment with antibiotics is usually not necessary and is not
effective
parenteral treatment with sex steroids to reduce sexual activity and self-interest
may help; if so, castration may be a permanent cure
- as  (ssi q  se  d a 
lowed by topical application of antibiotic creams may produce a temporary
control of the clinical signs; some cases need to be treated regularly before the
sheath is *re-seeded’ with commensal bacterial collected from another dog
prolonged topical antibiotic treatment alone should be avoided if possible since
it may select for other resistant organisms
NB: Pus may originate from the prostate gland but the dog invariably shows other
signs of prostate disease (see 17.7). Reduction in pus production by the normal
prepuce/penis may be impossible because it is probably stimulated by as yet uni-
dentified factors.
Penile neoplasms
 in countries free from transmissible venereal tumour, neoplasia of the penis is
rare
squamous cell carcinomas are the most usual type and commonly spread locally
and metastasize to inguinal lymph nodes
 haemorrhage from an ulcerated neoplasm may be the first clinical sign
in the absence of metastases radical surgical resection is warranted
Transmissiblevenereal tumour
 present in many countries especially southern Europe and Africa
 an interesting tumour biologically which is transmited coitally by *seeding’ of
infected cells
lesions are usually friable, can be large and ulcerated and often haemorrhagic
(Figure 17.2)
the tumour is not normally found within the UK
 local excision, amputation and chemotherapy (vincristine) may be suitable
treatments depending upon the location and extent of the tumour
spread to the nose and nasal cavity is commonly seen as a result of dogs licking
the primary lesion
17.3 TESTES
Ultrasound examination of the testes and epididymides should always be part of
the clinical examination in any cases of testicular pathology; in our laboratory we
have led the use of this technology [1,2,3] which has now a wide use in clinical
practice.
184
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care

mass that was subseguently found to be a transmissible venereal tumour. Such lesions are
usually friable, ulcerated and often haemorrhagic.
Anorchism
This is congenital absence of both testes.
 there is only one documented case of a male dog being born without testicles,
reported by the author's clinic [4]
in most cases the animal has two testes neither of which are within the scrotum
Adoddeu pasn s oue, ua au pue
anorchidism and previous castration can be confirmed by a human chorionic
gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation test (see 10.15); failure of testosterone con-
centrations to increase after hCG administration is diagnostic
Monorchidism
This is the condition of a dog having only one testicle.
s re isixa o q uo po e se piodn uaq rou sq 1!
removal of one testis
 the condition is not common and most cases are in fact unilateral cryptorchid
[i.e. they have one testis within the scrotum and one elsewhere)
Cryptorchidism
This is a condition in which there is failure of one or both testes to enter the
scrotum.
the testes may pass through the inguinal canal or not
 depending on whether both or one testicle fails to descend, the dog is called a
bilateral or unilateral cryptorchid (not monorchid)

administration of hCG. NB: There is overlap of testosterone concentration in the intact and
castrated dogs prior to hCG administration.
testes which are not within the scrotum still produce testosterone but generally
they do not produce spermatozoa because of the higher temperature; this means
that unilateral cryptorchids are usually fertile but bilateral cryptorchids are not
cryptorchid dogs usually have normal libido
testes are normally descended by 10 days of age but may be difficult to palpate
 in young pups due to their small size and the presence of scrotal fat; therefore
 a diagnosis is usually not confirmed until 10 weeks of age
bilateral cryptorchids can be diagnosed by a significant increase in testosterone
following the administration of hCG (Figure 17.3); a diagnostic test validated
by the author's laboratory [5]
 as cryptorchid dogs get older, the chance of normal descent becomes more
remote; it is very rare after 1 year of age
 sometimes fully descended testes in pups appear to become abdominal again;
the reason for this is not known
there is no reliable medical treatment shown to be efficacious for inducing
testicular descent
in any event, medical treatment is not ethical since the condition has a genetic
base
the mode of inheritance is not fully known but it follows the model of a sex-
limited autosomal recessive trait:
[a]
 both female and male parents will carry the gene
[b]
homozygous males will be cryptorchid
186
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
treatment is removal of the abdominal testis surgically because these testes are
more likely to become neoplastic than scrotal testes
 removal of the other testis at the same time is desirable to prevent the dog from
breeding
 surgical removal of the abdominal testis is not necessary until 18 months of
 age, as neoplastic changes are unlikely before this time
Ectopic testes
These are testes which do not occupy a normal scrotal position; essentially these
 are cryptorchid dogs where a different terminology is being used; in the author's
opinion the mode of inheritance is sex-limited autosomal recessive.
 the abdominal testes of cryptorchid dogs are therefore ectopic
 testes which have passed through the inguinal canal may then migrate away
from the scrotum to become ectopic
these testes may be found:
[a]
 anterior to the scrotum, under the skin and lateral to the penis; these may
be palpated under the skin
b]
in the femoral triangle; these are not palpable
[c]
caudally in the perineum, lateral to the corpus cavernosum; these may be
palpable
treatment is as for cryptorchid dogs
Testicular hypoplasia
 scrotal testes which do not develop properly, i.e. remain small after birth, are
rare; small testes are usually the result of degeneration (see Testicular
degeneration)
Traumatic orchitis (inflammation of the testis)
this may occur during any incident, but is commonly the result of dog fights
any lesion to the scrotal skin results in excessive licking and secondary
self-trauma
conservative therapy includes local cleansing, antibiosis, diuretics to reduce
swelling and, importantly, measures to pre vent self-trauma
 deep testicular lesions rarely heal well and may necessitate castration
healing is often followed by degeneration of the testis because of the increased
temperature that was experienced
not uncommonly the contralateral testis is also affected by testicular degenera-
tion, emphasizing the need for rapid and aggressive treatment of any case of
orchitis if fertility is to be salvaged
Abnormalities of the Male
187
Non-traumatic orchitis
in some countries Brucella canis infection causes acute orchitis and epididymitis
with sperm abnormalities and secondary infertililty
 the condition can be transmitted at coitus and screening programmes are
needed for breeding dogs and bitches
 following Brucella infection the testes become indurated and testicular degen-
eration ensues
treatment of Brucella canis is difficult (see 21.5)
oo stn ieu aissod si 1 inq ' au ui sasd ou si siuno ehan
will be introduced as a result of transportation of dogs to Europe for
breeding
 in the absence of Brucella a bacterial inflammation of the testis via ascending
infection or the haematogenous route is rare although in a small number of
dogs a degenerative orchitis can be associated with autoimmune thyroiditis
d r ssn e p s p ss  o ous  sop 
gland produce ejaculates containing large numbers of inflammatory cells;
their origin is unknown (the surface of the penis must be eliminated as the
source)
Testicular torsion
this is more correctly torsion of the spermatic cord
the cause of the torsion is unknown but appears to be associated with recent
exercise in many cases
 the condition is essentially a rotation of the testis within the scrotum
 as a result of the torsion the pampiniform plexus (see 6.6) becomes compressed
but blood continues to enter the testis via the spermatic artery; this causes
rapid swelling of the testis but since the testicular capsule is very fibrous the
swelling is restricted resulting in marked pain such that the dog is reluctant to
move
after a few hours the testis may be significantly damaged and at this time pal-
pation is no longer painful
diagnosis is relatively simple because there is swelling of the pampiniform
plexus, epididymis and testis (Figure 17.4)
frequently there is self-trauma to the scrotum because of the pain
haematuria may be a presenting sign
diagnosis is easy when testes are present within the scrotum, however the
condition may also occur in abdominal testes when there is acute abdominal
pain; the cause of which may only be diagnosed at exploratory laparotomy
surgical removal of the affected testis gives rapid pain relief and is always war-
ranted as the testis will never function properly again
 unless the condition is rapidly treated surgically the contralateral testis will
be affected by the increase in scrotal temperature and may suffer testicular
degeneration
188
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care

was torsion of the spermatic cord, resulting in swelling of the pampiniform plexus,
epidiymis and testis. The contralateral testis is normal.
Testicular degeneration
 a variety of initiating insults have been proposed including: testicular heating
(scrotal trauma, orchitis, testicular torsion), prolonged exposure to androgens
(either exogenous or endogenous for example a hormonally active testicular
neoplasm), some endocrinopathies, diabetes mellitus, presumed but unknown
toxins, and in some breeds an immune-mediated problem (see spermatogenic
arrest)
              as
affected
in the mid-course of the disease the testes become soft and smaller than normal;
ultrasonographically zones of increased echogenicity (probably representing
 calcification or fbrous tissue deposition) develop throughout the affected testis;
at this time the dog may be almost azoospermic [1]
late in the course of the condition the affected testes are small, hard and the
surface may be uneven; at this stage an irreversible azoospermia is present
usually both the spermatogenic and endocrine functions of the testis are lost:
 plasma testosterone concentrations are low
[b]
 plasma LH and FSH concentrations are high
no treatments have been shown to be efficacious for established testicular
degeneration
Abnormalities of the Male
189
Abnormal spermatogenesis [6]
this is the cause of some abnormal ejaculates associated with infertility
the affected testes may be normal, soft or small
the condition may be permanent for unknown reasons, or temporary, as caused
by pyrexia (see 6.6) and some drugs (see Chapter 27) [7]
there may be increased or decreased echogenicity of the testicular parenchyma
when examined with ultrasound
diagnosis may, however, require fine-needle aspiration; testicular biopsy is not
recommended since the sequelae of the procedure are severe
there is no proven effective treatment although in a small number of dogs
administration of the synthetic androgen mesterolone (an androgen that cannot
be aromatized to oestrogen and therefore has minimal negative feedback effects
upon the hypothalamus and pituitary gland) has been shown by the author to
marginally increase semen quality [8]; this may offer the only potential treat-
ment available in clinical practice
NB: The author has found no evidence that vaccination against parvovirus disease
causes infertility in dogs [9] nor that specific antibiotics have adverse effects on
semen quality [10].
Spermatogenic arrest (see 10.5)
this is a specific testicular degeneration
affected dogs are usually fertile initially
spermatogenesis stops suddenly, often between 18 months and 7 years of age
semen collection shows the presence of prostatic fluid and no spermatozoa
the
dog shows no signs of malaise
the testes may be smaller and softer than normal
the condition is irreversible
it is probably an autoimmune disease
it is inherited in some breeds including the Welsh springer spaniel and the
Labrador retriever
diagnosis can be made on the basis of semen evaluation, changes in testicular
ultrasonographic appearance, and fine-needle aspiration
 s   n sos  se   
increased parenchymal echogenicity, echogenic stippling and reduced testicular
volume [1]; these findings have enhanced our ability to diagnose these cases in
clinical practice
 early in the disease process many abnormal spermatozoa may be found within
the ejaculate
there is no proven effective treatment; the synthetic androgen, mesterolone,
 does not appear to prevent progression of the condition

Relationsbip of semen quality to fertility
Normal semen quality
on average semen quality is superior in fertile compared with non-fertile
samples
however, there is no unimpeachable method of predicting the fertility of a
semen sample
'normal values' from a variety of breeds are given in Table 17.1
some dogs with poor semen quality may be fertile using assisted reproductive
techniques
indeed the author's laboratory documented the first data on semen quality from
fertile males and showed a surprising range of qualities that were fertile [11]

Spermatozoal number
 an inverse relationship has been established between ejaculate volume and
spermatozoal concentration
there are also differences between large and small breeds of dog
 the determination of the total number of spermatozoa per ejaculate is the most
accurate measure of sperm production
infertility in the dog has not been associated simply with reduced spermatozoal
numbers, although irreversible azoospermia in previously fertile dogs has been
recognized for some time
cases of functional azoospermia with spermatogenic arrest have been recorded
in two related Welsh springer spaniels and in some related Labrador
retrievers
one case of azoospermia has been reported which was reversed following sexual
rest
a seasonal effect on spermatozoal production has been noted in dogs in warm
climates
Spermatozoal morphology
 a high incidence of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa is often associated
with reduced fertility
Abnormalities of the Male
¥191
 there have been few reports concerning the influence of specific morphological
abnormalities on fertility
 abnormal mid piece droplets were identified in an infertile greyhound dog
abnormal head-base/mid piece regions have also been associated with
infertility:
(a]  the commonest abnormality was swelling of the mid piece region
[b}  
 electron microscopic studies showed axonemal and mitochondrial defects
both within these membrane swellings and at other regions of the mid
piece
 spermatozoa with mid piece defects and deformed acrosomes have been found
associated with experimental Brucella canis infection
  q  e p   
affect fertility in the dog
 however, the relationship between the percentage of morphologically abnormal
spermatozoa and fertility of the dog has been established:
(a)  the fertility of dogs with greater than 60% morphologically normal sper
matozoa was 61%
(b) the fertility for those with less than 60% morphologically normal sper-
matozoa was 13%
Live:dead (vital) staining
 staining of spermatozoa with a vital stain is considered part of the normal
morphological assessment
in several species there have been good correlations found between the percent-
age of vital staining spermatozoa and fertility
there are two factors that may be involved:
(a)  the effect of the total number of live spermatozoa on fertility
(b)  the interference with fertility by the proportion of dead spermatozoa
 in the dog there has been little study of the proportion of dead spermatozoa
within the ejaculate; commonly only the total number of morphologically
normal live staining spermatozoa is considered
Spermatozoal motility
 some workers have suggested that spermatozoal motility is the best predictor
of male infertility
 human sperm swimming speeds correlate well with the results of in vitro fer-
tilization assays
 measurement of sperm swimming speeds in dogs, and the linearity of direction
do correlate with the ability of sperm to penetrate homologous occytes
Cytological studies
 o s jo ad a on  q s a   
spermatozoa within the ejaculate
192
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 little attention has been given to the presence of these cell types in the dog
it is common for inflammatory cells to be noted within the ejaculate; however,
these frequently originate from the prepuce
Assessment of spermatozoal function
 traditional criteria of semen quality are based upon descriptive assessments of
ejaculate characteristics
however, fertile dogs have been reported with low numbers of normal
spermatozoa
the phenomenon of spermatozoal swelling in the presence of hypo-osmotic
medium has been investigated; sperm swelling relies upon a functional mem-
brane which might be a better indicator of fertility than simple live:dead stains
 recent studies have examined computer image analysis of sperm motility and
demonstrated that the ability of sperm to change motility characteristics to
become hyperactivated correlates with the ability to penetrate homologous
oocytes
oocyte binding assays and oocyte penetration assays are useful for experimental
investigation of fertility but as yet are not applicable to routine laboratory use
Treatment ofdogswith poor semen quality
 in all cases a holistic approach to the male should be taken, especially with
respect to animals that are overweight or obese; dogs should have a well bal-
anced diet with suitable levels of antioxidants
 most medical treatments are unrewarding and the owner should be given real-
istic advice before embarking on therapy
an analogue of dihydrotestosterone, mesterolone, is unusual in that it is not
aromatized to oestradiol and therefore, at therapeutic doses, does not signifi-
cantly suppress the release of pituitary gonadotrophins; it may be useful for
stimulating spermatogenesis and it has been used in dogs [4], but its effects
have not as yet been fully evaluated
General points on infertile dogs
‘overuse' is rarely a cause of infertility; most dogs produce sufficient sperma-
tozoa for two fertile ejaculations per day; rarely in older dogs daily mating will
affect extra-gonadal sperm reserves and the number of sperm ejaculated will
decline, and immature sperm (those with distal and proximal cytoplasmic
droplets) will appear in the ejaculate
if semen quality is poor, allow the dog to mate twice daily for as long as the
bitch will stand
 if there has been recent illness (pyrexia) it is prudent to rest the dog for 2
months and examine semen after that time. This is not because this will allow
Abnormalities of the Male
193
recuperation, but because the ejaculate will probably be abnormal for this
length of time
do not use androgens (testosterone or its esters) in dogs with poor semen
quality or poor libido; these have minimal effect upon libido and generally have
a marked suppression effect upon spermatogenesis
 parvovirus vaccination does not cause infertility in male dogs
dogs with poor semen quality that have immune-mediated thyroiditis usually
have systemic signs of hypothyroidism; it is not appropriate to treat with
thyroid hormone supplementation just in case'
 it should be expected that bacteria will be isolated from the penis and with the
exception of Brucella canis there is no known bacterial cause of infertility in
dogs
Testicular cysts/spermatocoele
 well defined fluid-flled lesions are not uncommonly identified within the testes
 using ultrasound examination
these may be non-significant developmental cysts or be the result of outflow
obstruction (a spermatocoele)
 there are no known treatments
Hydrocoele
these are very rare in the dog
they may be diagnosed by palpation and ultrasound imaging [3]
Testicular tumours
 testicular tumours are the second most common tumour affecting the male dog
 the author has published ultrasound findings of these tumour types enabling
enhanced diagnosis in clinical practice [1,2]
a variety of different tumour types are seen
Sertoli cell tumours
 these neoplasms are often discrete, slow growing and commonly unilateral
they generally cause testicular enlargement because of the size of the
tumour:
[a}
 In the early phases of the disease they are not palpable but they often
produce oestrogen and therefore disturb semen quality [2]
[b]
later in the phase of the disease the oestrogen production causes atrophy
of normal testicular tissue within the affected testis and the contralateral
194
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
testis; often the contralateral testis is small and the ipsilateral testis is
normal sized (because of the neoplasm) or larger than normal
 oestrogen causes feminization and this may be the initial reason for presenta-
tion, because the male is attractive to male dogs, or because gynaecomastia, a
pendulous prepuce, or bilateral non-pruritic alopecia are noted
 the oestrogen-induced testicular degeneration results in an initial teratozoosper-
mia (many morphologically abnormal sperm) and then azoospermia (absence
of sperm from the ejaculate)
the atrophy of testicular tissue may only be reversible if the tumour is removed
within 12 months; after that permanent testicular degeneration ensures
 ss mo q    no g
results in anaemia and thrombocytopenia
high oestrogen concentrations may cause squamous metaplasia of the prostate
gland
Sertoli tumours rarely metastasize; only 10% are malignant
small endocrinologically active tumours may cause clinical signs but be non-
palpable; these tumours may be diagnosed ultrasonographically; commonly
they are well marginated, have an irregular echogenicity and there is a central
 zone of fluid representing necrosis
 all tumours should be removed surgically by castration; unilateral castration
may result in a return to fertility once the negative feedback effect of oestrogen
has been removed
Seminomas
 these tumours arise from spermatogenic tissue of the tubular epithelium
they are usually solitary and unilateral and cause testicular enlargement which
can be very pronounced
seminomas are usually hormonally inactive, but if they are hormonally
active, similar signs and consequences are seen to those with Sertoli cell
tumours
seminomas are most commonly echogenic with ultrasound examination
these tumours have a medium risk of metastasis and should be removed
surgically
Interstitial cell tumours
 these tumours arise from Leydig cells
they may be single or multiple in one or both testes and are often approximately
1-2cm in diameter
affected testicles may shrink due to loss of seminiferous tubules and absence
of spermatogenesis and yet surprisingly these tumours are found to be hormo-
nally inactive (or at least do not produce the common hormones seen in Sertoli
cell tumours)
Abnormalities of the Male

often not diagnosed due to lack of clinical signs and lack of clinical
importance
·  yellow in colour when sliced open
NB: Diagnosis of Sertoli cell tumours and seminoma in abdominal testes may only
be at exploratory laparotomy by which time metastasis may have occurred.
Feminizing syndrome (see also 20.7)
 most commonly this is associated with a testicular tumour producing oestrogen
(see above)
 occasionally the condition is seen in dogs with adrenal oestrogen production
diagnostic evaluation involves ultrasound examination of the testes and the
adrenal glands
in a small number of cases the condition is seen in dogs with grossly and ultra-
sonographically normal testes and ultrasonographically normal adrenal glands;
anecdotally in some of these dogs castration cures the condition
feminization may also occur in some castrated dogs, and adrenal steroid pro-
duction has been implicated
 adrenal disease in either intact or castrated dogs may be evaluated by detecting
elevated concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone following a standard
ACTH stimulation test
 adrenal disease signs may be controlled by the negative feedback effects of
exogenous androgens or progestogens
17.4 EPIDIDYMIDES
there are few reports of epididymal disease in dogs and much material that is
published relates to an assumption that pathology is similar to other species.
Obstruction of the epididymis can be diagnosed by absence of the epididymal
markers alkaline phosphatase from ejaculated fluid (see 10.6); absence of these
may be useful for the diagnosis of obstructive azoospermia, but care must be
taken to ensure that complete ejaculation has occurred since dogs that fail to
fully ejaculate will also have low concentrations. A small number of conditions
have been accurately described
trauma and inflammation may occur as in the testis
aplasia has been recorded
idiopathic blockage; here early in the course of the disease the tail of the epidi-
dymis may be noticeably enlarged
17.5 VASA DEFERENTIA
 idiopathic blockage may occur but has not been recorded in dogs
 one case of aplasia has been recorded
196
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
17.6 URETHRA
 there are few abnormalities affecting the prostatic or perineal urethra, although
occasionally lesions may develop secondary to urethral obstruction or cathe-
terization; rarely these result in fistula formation
hypospadias, where the urethra opens in an abnormal position, is usually, but
not always, associated with intersexuality (see 18.4)
 urethritis is rare per se but may be associated with urinary calculi, fracture of
the os penis and repeated catheterization
Urethral prolapse
txcessive sexual excitement or urinary straining may produce prolapse of the
terminal portion of the urethra
the everted portion becomes oedematous and may bleed; in the acute phase a
small red button-like lesion is present on the tip of the penis, later this may
become indurated and distorted
the common presentation is excessive licking at the prepuce
some dogs show no clinical signs
early in the course of the disease the prolapsed portion of the urethra may be
replaced if not damaged; this is best done using a snug-fitting urethral catheter
which needs to be left in place for several days
amputation of the distal penis may be necessary in chronic cases or when there
is marked trauma or the problem is recurrent
 castration should be considered to prevent recurrence
17.7  PROSTATE GLAND
 The prostate is the only accessory sexual gland in the male dog.
 prostatic disease is common in the older entire male dog (prostatic neoplasia
isord yo sisoueip pue uooaap aeoot (op paenseo aui u nnooo Ae
work in our laboratory has shown that the first and third fractions of the
ejaculate originate from the prostate gland [4]; this information is clinically
useful since cytological examination of these fluids may reveal the nature of
any prostatic pathology
Benign prostatic hyperplasia
hyperplasia of the prostatic epithelium begins early in the dog's life; both glan-
dular and complex (cystic) hyperplasia occur
Abnormalities of the Male
197
 this is associated with altered androgen:oestrogen ratios; there is a slight decline
in androgen concentrations whilst oestrogen concentrations are maintained
 hyperplasia is commonly present without clinical signs
however, in some dogs the hyperplasia is significant and causes:

 position of the urethra, and changes within the prostatic urethra
ultrasonographically there is often enlargement of the gland and slight increased
echogenicity (Figure 17.5):
this change may mask the normal appearance of the hilar echo
[b]
the condition usually progresses quite early to cystic hyperplasia where
multiple thin-walled fluid-filled cysts from a few millimetres to several
centimetres in size are identified
[c]
later on in the disease the cysts may become very large, and the back-
 ground texture of the parenchyma becomes quite echogenic and the gland
margin may become irregular
increased echogenicity of the gland, increased maximal width, and the presence of at least
one fluid-filled cyst (arrow).

 arginine esterase concentrations are elevated in older dogs with prostatic hyper-
plasia but no data exist for old dogs without hyperplasia; therefore whilst some
have described arginine esterase as a specific marker for prostatic hyperplasia
as yet this is unconfirmed
the condition can be managed by removal of androgen stimulation either by
castration or medical management
choice for dogs that are not required for breeding
 in stud dogs temporary control of clinical signs may be achieved using either;
[a]
 exogenous progestogens - these reduce circulating androgens and have a
direct effect on the prostate but do not significantly reduce the size of any
cysts; depot therapy (e.g. delvosterone) and oral therapy (e.g. osaterone)
is very useful but all progestogens have adverse effects upon semen quality
[b]
 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride) prevent the conversion of
testosterone into its active form and can be used to reduce prostatic size;
daily therapy is required and although there is a substantial effect reducing
semen volume there is no effect upon sperm characteristics or fertility
[c]
oestrogens may also be used to reduce circulating androgen concentra.
tions and therefore reduce prostatic size, however these have significant
effects upon semen quality and have a range of other adverse effects which
make them inappropriate for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia
now that finasteride is available
NB: Oestrogens may induce prostatic squamous metaplasia resulting in increased
size of the gland.
[d]
 GnRH agonists administered via long-lasting implant (e.g. deslorelin) will
cause decreased testosterone and shrinkage of the prostate by inducing a
reduction in LH secretion
Acute bacterial prostatitis
 adult dogs may develop prostatitis following ascending infection of bacteria
along the urethra, commonly these bacteria are Escherichia coli or similar
uropathogenic adherent bacteria
bacterial prostatitis is sometimes a sequel to hyperplasia
clinical signs include systemic illness, with vomiting and caudal abdominal pain
dogs are frequently neutrophilic and the gland is painful and has an irregular
contour on palpation
culture of the third fraction of the ejaculate, urethral washing or urine may
help with diagnosis
 patchy focal echogenic regions may be identified with ultrasound but early
ultrasonographic findings may be equivocal
treatment of these cases is difficult; antimicrobial therapy on the basis of the
results of bacterial sensitivity may be required for up to 6 weeks, progestogens
can be useful adjuvant therapy
Abnormalities of the Male
199
 there are particular antibiotics that do not have adverse effects upon semen
quality [10]
Chronic bacterial prostatitis
 dogs with acute bacterial prostatitis where no or inadequate treatment is used
may develop chronic prostatitis
bacteria are scattered throughout the gland and pockets of purulent exudate
may form
the gland may become distorted in shape and is often painful to palpate; there
 may also be attachment of the prostate to the pelvic tissue making it difficult
to move
 the prostate is often more echogenic than normal although it may develop a
heterogenous appearance as the micro-abscesses become apparent 
large numbers of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and bacteria are present in
prostatic fluid collected at the time of ejaculation or following urethral wash
 these cases can be very difficult to treat and require prolonged period of anti-
biotic administration
Prostatic abscessation
 cases of chronic bacterial prostatitis may progress to prostatic abscessation
with multiple pus-filled cavitated lesions
the prostate becomes very large such that it falls forward into the abdomen
and may no longer be palpated within the pelvis per rectum
prostatomegaly can be detected by radiography or ultrasound; ultrasonograph-
ically there are consistent features of thick-walled irregularly septated regions
containing fluid with echogenic particles
these dogs are unable to ejaculate but collection of prostatic fluid by urethral
wash reveals large numbers of bacteria and polymorphonuclear neutrophils
 the consistent bacterial focus in the urethra often produces signs of recurrent
cystitis
 surgical ablation or omentalization is required combined with a prolonged
treatment with antimicrobial agents
Squamous prostatic metaplasia
· a change in the prostatic glandular epithelium from cuboidal or columnar to
 squamous occurs secondarily to endogenous or exogenous hyperoestrogenism
(e.g. Sertoli cell tumours)
 this change predisposes to cyst formation, infection and abscessation, but is
 not a pre-neoplastic change
 a presumptive diagnosis may be made on the history and clinical signs
200
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
treatment is directed towards removal of the source of oestrogen because the
condition is reversible
Prostatic cysts
two types of prostatic cyst have been identified:
[a]
the least common are discrete retention cysts associated with blockage of
the prostatic ducts; these occur within the parenchyma of the prostate,
 causing distortion of its outline
b)
 more commonly, cysts are found adjacent to the prostate (paraprostatic
cysts), attached by small stalk-like adhesions; these are remnants of the
uterus masculinus
the clinical signs of both types of cyst are related to their size; they may produce
pelvic canal obstruction, faecal tenesmus, dysuria and haematuria
diagnosis may be made radiographically, although ultrasound examination can
differentiate the internal architecture of the organ:
[a]
d ss r  a a si srd
cranial or dorso-cranial to the bladder
[b]
the removal of urine or injection of small volumes of air into the bladder
may allow differentiation from the paraprostatic cyst in cases of doubt
[c)
the cyst wall can be of variable thickness and may be echogenic due to
calcification
P
 o sas   p a    
dependent portion
e]
 many cysts have echogenic internal septae and a connection to the prostate
gland may sometimes be imaged
[t]
it is not uncommon for cystic lesions to also be identified within the
prostate gland (Figure 17.6)

some zones is calcified.
Abnormalities of the Male
201
excision or marsupialization are the treatments of choice; castration and
hormone therapy are of no value
Prostatic neoplasia
 adenocarcinomata are the most common neoplasms affecting the prostate
gland of the dog (Figure 17.7)
tumours are firm upon palpation and tend to metastasize to iliac and sublumbar
lymph nodes and to the vertebral bodies of caudal lumbar vertebrae
clinical signs are associated with the increased size of the gland, although dogs
may have a haemorrhagic urethral discharge and hind limb pain
diagnosis may be made on the basis of clinical signs, radiographic findings, the
presence of neoplastic cells collected by urethral washing following prostatic
massage or semen collection
patchy focal regions of mixed echogenicity may be identifed with ultrasound;
these may be associated with an increased parenchymal echogenicity and fine
echogenic speckles, overall there is loss of the normal architecture
 our work has shown that it is possible to assess prostatic perfusion using
colour-enhanced ultrasound; using this technique we have demonstrated dif-
ferences in the perfusion of lesions that are malignant from those that are
benign [13,14]; these techniques will in the future be developed further to
enhance our diagnostic ability in clinical practice
 fine-needle aspiration under ultrasound guidance or biopsy are valuable diag-
nostic tools
 the animal should be carefully examined for metastatic spread before embark-
ing on therapy
 treatment can be palliative by the administration of oestrogens, anti-androgens,
and by castration
Figure 17.7 Prostatic adenocarcinoma.
202
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Medical therapy for prostatic disease (see also Chapter 27)
long-term therapy is aimed at reducing the size of the gland, i.e. reducing cir-
culating concentrations of androgens
this can be achieved by the repeated administration of hormone
preparations:
 progestogens which have a negative feedback effect upon the pituitary
(there are available as daily oral or injectable depot preparations)
[b]
finasteride which is a specific 5-alpha reductase inhibitor which prevents
the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone
[c]
oestrogens which have a negative feedback effect upon the pituitary but
suffer the risk of inducing prostatic metaplasia
[P
futamide which inhibits androgen uptake and/or nuclear binding of
androgen
[e]
formestane which is an aromatase inhibitor which inhibits the conversion
 of androgen to oestrogen in peripheral tissue
NB: No medical therapies will produce permanent relief of large prostatic cysts
or neoplasia.
 antibiotics which are chosen for chronic prostatitis and prostatic abscessation
should be chosen upon the basis of specific sensitivity; however, erythromy
cin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim are most likely to be concentrated
in prostatic fluid, although other agents may penetrate the gland when it is
inflamed
 analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs may be indicated
Surgical removal of the whole gland, a portion of the gland, a cystic region or
abscessed area may be considered.
Effects of prostatic disease on fertility
 blood and inflammatory cells in the ejaculate do not seem to markedly affect
fertility although substantial sperm clumping may occur
it is possible that changes in the prostatic fluid that occur in cases of prostatic
disease may have osmotic or other effects on sperm which reduce their
viability
 medical treatments with progestogens or oestrogens inhibit testicular and pro-
Aru os inq uma A  an e io uoun is

 medical treatment with finasteride reduces the volume of the ejaculate but does

17.8 SCROTUM
Scrotal trauma (abrasions, eczema)
 any trauma to the scrotum is painful and results in substantial licking which
frequently causes additional secondary trauma
immediate treatment (antibiotics, analgesics, Elizabethan collar) is necessary to
bring testicular temperature under control to ensure that there are no secondary
testicular changes (testicular degeneration) (see 17.3)
Inguinal (scrotal) hernia
 this is rare in the dog and is recognized as swelling in the scrotum due to the
 passage of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal
 pi a jo ao p s oo ps si a
17.9 MAMMARY GLAND
Mammary gland disease is rare in the dog but mammary tumours do occur; most
are benign and the principles of treatment are as for those described in the bitch
(see 16.8).

Intersex Animals
Whilst intersex animals are not that common, the clinical presentation results in
 x oq s   s e  i 
are most commonly recognized because of abnormal external (phenotypical) sex
appearance.
18.1  DEFINITIONS
True hermaphrodite: in mammals this word is used to describe individuals which
have both testicular and ovarian tissue; invariably the testicular tissue is intra-
abdominal so that spermatogenesis does not occur.
Male pseudohermaphrodite: this is an animal with testicular tissue but external
genitalia which are to a greater or lesser extent *female-like' (Figure 18.1a).
Female pseudohermaphrodite: has ovarian tissue but external genitalia which are
to a greater or lesser extent *male-like' (Figure 18.1b).
Intersex: this is an individual in which the physical features do not conform to
those generally recognized as belonging to the male or female. This is the best
word to use to describe dogs of indeterminate sex as their gonadal content will
not be known until histological examination is made (for clarity intersex animals
may be true hermaphrodite or pseudohermaphrodite).
18.2 AETI0LOGY
Intersex animals may be classified into those with abnormalities of either (1) chro-
mosomal, (2) gonadal or (3) phenotypic sex.
Abnormalities of chromosomal sex (see 1.6 for basic genetics)
generally these animals are phenotypically male or female but they have under-
developed genitalia

Figure 18.1 Intersex dogs. (a) This animal was sold as a normal female pup; at 5-6
months of age, growth and exposure of the phallus (clitoris) was noticed. (b) This dog was
assumed tobe a normal male until he was presented with haemorrhage from the prepuce
and a history of being attractive to male dogs; closer examination revealed that the
prepuce was rudimentary, there was no palpable penis and the dog was in oestrus.
(c) Internal genitalia from dog in (a); a uterine horn (U), ductus deferens (D) and testis (T) are
shown (B, urinary bladder). (d) Internal genitalia from dog in (b); the vagina (V), uterus (U)
and ovaries (O) are shown (B, urinary bladder).
 accurate demonstration of chromosomal abnormalities requires construction of
a karyotype (a blood sample is sent to an appropriate diagnostic laboratory)
 the chromosomal abnormalities are not usually an inherited condition, rather
this can be:
[a]
 an extra sex chromosome, e.g. XXY, XXX
[b]
 only one sex chromosome, e.g. XO
[c]
more than one cell line in the same individual with different sex chromo-
some contents (termed a *mosaic'), e.g. XX/XY or XX/XXY
Intersex Animals
207
Abnormalities of gonadal sex
these animals may initially appear to have normal genitalia but whilst they
have a normal chromosome constitution the chromosomal and gonadal sex do
not agree
· affected animal are said to be 'sex-reversed'
only XX sex reversal is seen in dogs, i.e. XX male or XX pseudo-
hermaphrodite
such dogs have testes or ovotestes
this is seen as an inherited condition of cocker spaniels and other breeds
 it is thought to be caused by an inherited sex-reversal gene
Abnormalities of phenotypic sex
 these animals have an intermediate appearance to the external genitalia and
 yet the chromosomal and gonadal sex agree
 clearly that has to have been some problem in the development of the repro-
ductive tract
 female pseudohermaphrodites are caused by exposure of the fetus to sex ster-
oids (usually androgens or progestogens) during critical stages of development;
 usually these are exogenously administered but sometimes one fetus is affected
by an adjacent fetus or the dam has a hormonal imbalance
male pseudohermaphroditism may be inherited or be due to a defect in andro-
gen production
18.3 CLINICAL SIGNS
 affected individuals are usually not recognized as puppies
in some cases the external appearance is normal or nearly normal and no
abnormality is noticed until either breeding is proposed or until surgical
neutering
 in many cases abnormality is noticed around the time of puberty; commonly,
abnormal development of the genitalia, particularly enlargement of the clitoris
(phallus), is noticed at about 6 months of age
 other signs which alert an owner to abnormality include pro-oestrous bleeding
in dogs thought to be males, and urinary incontinence
 incontinence is usually caused when a normal vagina opens into a severely
narrowed vestibule associated with an enlarged os clitoridis (Figure 18.1a);
urine is then voided normally from the bladder but accumulates in the dis-
tended vagina from which it leaks slowly via the stenosed vestibule
· adult dogs, particularly male pseudohermaphrodites, may first be presented
with pyometra or Sertoli cell tumour
208
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
18.4 EXTERNAL PHYSICAL SIGNS
 in dogs that look mainly female, the vulva is more ventrally placed than usual
 and may be between the thighs; there may be varying protrusion of the clitoris
due to enlargement of the os clitoridis which now resembles a small os penis
with a narrowed vestibular canal running like a male urethra along its caudal
surface
 in dogs that look mainly male-like the preputial opening is further forward but
the prepuce is short; the preputial opening may be ventral with urethral hypo-
spadias (see 17.2) - alternatively the prepuce may be normal but contains no
penis
if testicles are present in either of the above they may be abdominal or scrotal
18.5 INTERNAL REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS
irrespective of the external signs the gonads may be ovaries, testes or a mixture
of both (ovotestes); they may be in a normal ovarian position, or located any-
where along the normal testis path of descent 
irrespective of the sort of gonads present, the tubular genitalia may consist of
a uterus, or epididymis/vas deferens, or both together
18.6 TREATMENT
in terms of prognosis intersex dogs are nearly always sterile and therefore
treatment is aimed at producing a pet with minimal complications from the
underlying abnormality
removal of the gonads and tubular genitalia at laparotomy prevents the dis-
comfort that some animals show in oestrus, avoids pyometra and prevents the
development of testicular tumours
after removal of testicular tissue from dogs with a protruding phallus, time
should be allowed for this to regress; otherwise reduction of the size of the
 q  sd s    n
there may be no cure for incontinence in intersexual dogs, although a variety
of reconstructive techniques have been described but are not in the scope of
this book

Abnormal Female Physiology
and Endocrinology
There are many different causes of infertility and reproductive disease in the bitch;
physiological and endocrinological abnormalities are important and reference to
the normal physiology can often elucidate the exact abnormality.
19.1 DELAYED PUBERTY (PRIMARY ANOESTRUS)
 the age of a bitch at her first pro-oestrus/oestrus is very variable; it may not
occur until she is over 2 years of age
the reason for this delay is usually not known but it is clear that large and
giant breeds of dog reach puberty later than smaller breeds; often puberty is
reached when the female reaches approximately 80% of her adult body mass
it is not uncommon for some bitches to be very fastidious at the first oestrus
and to lick away any vulval discharge such that the pubertal oestrus is over-
looked by the owner
when pro-oestrus/oestrus does eventually occur, it is usually normal
there is no reason why a mature bitch should not be mated at her first oestrus;
indeed several hereditary diseases are not present in the female at a young age
(e.g. many eye diseases) and therefore there is no rush to breed bitches early
the best approach is not to attempt oestrus induction but to monitor vaginal
cytology so that the onset of pro-oestrus can be predicted, or to measure plasma
progesterone concentration; an elevated progesterone concentration indicates
that the oestrus has been missed by the owner
 if oestrus has not been missed and the delay is causing concern, establishment
of the karyotype can be useful in some cases prior to attempting oestrus induc-
tion (see 24.4)
if signs of pro-oestrus/oestrus are induced this at least confirms that the bitch
has an ovary and that it can respond to gonadotrophic stimuli
a dog with X-chromosome trisomy and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) plasma concentrations has been reported;
it was still anoestrus at 4 years old
 hypothyroidism is rarely the cause primary anoestrus

19.2 PROLONGED FIRST PRO-OESTRUS
in some bitches the frst pro-oestrus does not proceed to oestrus and may
last for 3 weeks or more, or pro-oestrus may terminate and recur some weeks
later
presumably there is insufficient pituitary stimulation to cause follicle matura-
tion or insufficient LH receptors on the follicles
 as a result ovulation does not occur, follicles therefore regress and signs of
pro-oestrus disappear
 theoretically, administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG - which
is LH-like in activity) should cause ovulation; however this is rarely effective
which suggests that follicles are still immature
 often a second follicular phase appears (2-12 weeks later) and the bitch ovu-
lates normally; very rarely the anovulatory cycle is repeated before a third
ovulatory cycle
 when the signs of pro-oestrus are very prolonged (more than 45 days) and hCG
treatment has been unsuccessful it may be prudent to suppress the signs of
 sep 8 rg syz ie iae os uoisaod e is ss
causes cessation of pro-oestrus); the time of occurrence of the next pro-oestrus
is variable but it usually then proceeds normally
NB: There is some risk of inducing a pyometra by administration of a progestogen
when oestrogen concentrations are elevated.
Very rarely young bitches with persistent pro-oestrus have ovarian tumours
that produce oestrogen; these can relatively easily be diagnosed by ultrasound
examination.
19.3 PROLONGED PRO-OESTRUS OR OESTRUS
(Figure 19.1)
 it is important to recognize that normal bitches may not ovulate at the expected
time; in the author's clinic we found that some normal fertile bitches do not
 ovulate until 30 days after the onset of pro-oestrus [1]; these data are important
and have enabled differentiation of the normal from the abnormal bitch in
clinical practice

adult bitch that has previously been normal
the condition appears to be most common in German shepherd dogs and
similar breeds as part of an anovulation/short luteal phase syndrome
 in these cases administration of hCG (500 IU/bitch on 3 consecutive days) may
be useful to “force’ ovulation; a key consideration is the time that hCG is
administered and it appears best when there is maximal cornification of vaginal
epithelial cells or when there is a slight increase in plasma progesterone
concentration

 despite induction of ovulation some of these bitches have a short luteal phase
 out pregnancy has been described but must be applied cautiously otherwise it
will affect the sexual development of the pups in utero
19.4 SHORT INTER-OESTROUS PERIODS (OVULATION
FAILURE) (Figure 19.2)
 intervals of less than 4 months between successive oestrous periods suggest 
that:
[a]
ovulation (luteinization) may not have occurred
[b]
the luteal phase may be short; this has only been reported after oestrus
induction and in the German shepherd and similar breeds (see 19.3)
 a difficulty with the condition is that the bitch may have a normal length pro-
oestrus and oestrus and when these end the cycle is thought to have been
normal (although there has been no ovulation)
 the condition is then recognized when the bitch does not become pregnant and
there is a short interval to the next pro-oestrus
confirmation of ovulation can however be achieved by monitoring plasma
progesterone concentrations
the length of the luteal phase can be monitored by regular measurement of
plasma progesterone concentration (see 5.9)

Figure 19.2 Schematic representation of short luteal phase seen in German shepherd and
similar breeds where there is abnormal ovulation/inadequate development of the corpora

in cases of anovulation, an attempt to induce ovulation can be made by the
administration of hCG, but
[a]
it is difficult to know when to administer this
[b]
early administration may result in follicular luteinization
[c]
late administration may be ineffectual
 administration is best planned at maximal cornification of vaginal epithelial
cells or when there is a slight increase in plasma progesterone
 the short luteal phase can result in pregnancy but subsequent loss as proges-
terone concentration decreases, or lack of pregnancy (Figure 19.2)
19.5 PROLONGED ANOESTRUS
(SECONDARY ANOESTRUS)
the inter-oestrous interval may normally be longer than expected:
[a]
 in many cases this is because pro-oestrus has not been observed by the
owner but occurred normally; elevated concentrations of progesterone
(greater than 2 ng/ml) will indicate a missed ovulation within the previous
2 months
b)
in some bitches there is systemic illness for example and endocrinopathy
that prevents the return to pro-oestrus; rarely this may be associated with
luteal cysts; hypothyroidism does not appear to be a common cause of
prolonged anoestrus unless there are very marked clinical signs
[c]
some drugs including progestogens, androgens, glucocorticoids and ana-
bolic steroids have the ability to prevent oestrus
[d]
 in the basenji dog oestrus occurs only every 12 months
 if the delayed return to pro-oestrus interferes with a breeding programme,
oestrus induction may be considered (see 24.4)
Abnormal Female Physiology and Endocrinology
213
19.6  UNPREDICTABLE OVULATION TIME
(see also 3.4 and Figure 3.2)
 in normal bitches there is a very large variation in the day on which ovulation
Occurs after the onset of pro-oestrus; this constitutes the most common cause
of infertility since often the owner decides which day to attempt breeding, and
usually they choose a fixed day, e.g. day 12 and day 14
whilst the ‘average bitch' ovulates approximately 12 days after the beginning
of pro-oestrus, this is not true for all bitches:
[a]
 some bitches ovulate as early as day 5 after the onset of pro-oestrus
(b)   some bitches ovulate as late as day 30 after the onset of pro-oestrus
such bitches are normal but they are not average'
bitches are not necessarily consistent at successive heats; some bitches may vary
by as much as 12 days in the day of ovulation between successive cycles, i.e.
they ovulate on day 8 at one oestrus and day 20 at the subsequent oestrus [1]
 careful monitoring of each oestrous cycle is therefore warranted; this can be
achieved using vaginal cytology, vaginal endoscopy and measurement of plasma
progesterone concentration
19.7
SILENT OESTRUS
 some bitches have normal cyclical activity, including follicular growth and
ovulation, without any external signs of pro-oestrus or oestrus
vulval swelling appears minimal during oestrus; these bitches are also very
fastidious and clear away any vulval discharge by licking
ovulation may be confirmed by examination of plasma progesterone
concentration
alternatively, the weekly collection of cells from the bitch's vagina will allow
anticipation of oestrus
demonstration of an ele vated progesterone concentration will demonstrate that
oestrus has occurred within the last 2 months and was not observed by the
owner
19.8
PSEUDOPREGNANCY (See alsO 3.7)
 all non-pregnant bitches will develop mammary gland enlargement and the
production of milk during the late luteal phase
 many non-pregnant bitches exhibit signs which are similar to those seen nor-
mally during the pre-partum and post-partum periods
signs may develop occasionally, or following every oestrus in an individual
bitch
ua Aue ym peiosse iou are uadopasd jo suis ieu a
abnormality; they are related to a normal elevated plasma concentration of
prolactin
214
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
the term physiological pseudopregnancy may be used in some cases, because
in every non-pregnant bitch there is some degree of mammary gland
enlargement
Clinical signs
clinical pseudopregnancy (sometimes referred to as overt pseudopregnancy) has
 a variable clinical presentation including anorexia, nervousness, aggression,
 nest making, nursing of inanimate objects, lactation and occasionally false
parturition
 in some cases lactation may result in mastitis
 pseudopregnancy is generally noted between 6 and 12 weeks after the end of
oestrus, during the decline in plasma progesterone concentration
 it may also occur should plasma progesterone concentration decline for other
reasons:
[a]
removal of the ovaries (i.e. ovariectomy or ovariohysterectomy) during the
luteal phase will result in a rapid reduction in plasma concentration of
[b]
- d d i  e n      n si
tration, i.e. following spontaneous abortion in late pregnancy, or the
pharmacological termination of pregnancy
 in many cases pseudopregnancy undergoes spontaneous remission, especially
if there is no stimulus for continued lactation (no sucking)
in some cases either the physical or the psychological signs, or the effect of
these signs upon the owner, may warrant treatment of the condition
 in some cases pseudopregnancy may persist for many months, or even several
years; the reason for this is unknown, but presumably relates to a lack of
hormonal interaction between the pituitary/hypothalamus and the ovary
 it is often mistakenly stated that clinical pseudopregnancy predisposes to pyo
metra, infertility and ovarian abnormalities; however, this is not the case
Treatment
 in the majority of cases, clinical pseudopregnancy requires no treatment; spon-
taneous resolution can be allowed to occur
 ovariectomy or ovariohysterectomy has no value for the treatment of clinical
pseudopregnancy:
[a]
)at certain stages of the cycle removal of the ovaries will cause a further
reduction in plasma progesterone, and potentiate the rise of plasma
prolactin
[b]
 ovariohysterectomy will prevent the occurrence of pseudopregnancy,
but caution should be exercised in performing surgery too soon after
recovery
[c]
in bitches that have repeated clinical pseudopregnancy the best time to
perform surgery is during the subsequent oestrus
Abnormal Female Physiology and Endocrinology
215
Conservative treatment
 anecdotally it is reported that increasing exercise and possibly reducing food
intake may be helpful
sedative agents may be useful, but phenothiazines may be inappropriate,
because they are dopamine antagonists and may produce a rise in prolactin
concentration
 massage of the mammary glands should be avoided because stimulation may
potentiate a further rise in prolactin concentration
 diuretic agents may speed the resolution of the clinical signs but should be
administered with care, especially if the bitch is anorexic
Drug therapy
 before embarking upon medical treatment it is important to establish that the
bitch is pseudopregnant and not pregnant, because administration of pharma-
ceutical products used to treat pseudopregnancy to a pregnant bitch will ter-
minate pregnancy or prevent parturition
we have documented exactly this case scenario when bitches presented as
a se huq sraumo an adsap suad ioey u aram suardopnasd
the bitch could not have been mated [2]
Prolactin inhibitors
 se veral dopamine agonists have been shown to be inhibitors of prolactin secretion
cabergoline is widely available and has few adverse effects compared with
previous prolactin inhibitors
cabergoline may cause vomiting in a small proportion of cases (it is best admin-
istered with food), it may also cause a more rapid return to pro-oestrus than
anticipated and if inadvertently administered to a pregnant bitch it will cause
pregnancy termination
 prolactin concentrations decrease rapidly after administration and the behav-
ioural manifestations reduce quickly and milk production decreases a few days
later
treatment is usually administered for 5 or 7 days or longer if signs remain at
the end of planned treatment
Progestogens
 progesterone (or progestogen) use has been largely superseded by the prolactin
inhibitors
 progestogens produce a reduction in concentrations of prolactin and rapidly
reduce the clinical signs
progestogens may be administered either orally daily (e.g. megestrol acetate),
recommended because they might potentiate the development of a pyometra
216
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 rapid cessation of oral therapy is often associated with relapse of the clinical
signs, and gradual reduction of the dose over 7 days is recommended to
prevent this
Oestrogens and androgens
 both oestrogens and androgens alone and in combination are effective at reduc-
 ing the clinical signs of clinical pseudopregnancy
their mechanism is likely to be the same as that of progesterone (i.e. inhibition
of prolactin concentrations)
androgens or oestrogens are not frequently used alone; however, a synthetic
androgen, mibolerone, which is not available in the UK but is available in the
USA, is effective
 in some countries combinations of ethinyl oestradiol and methyltestosterone
were manufactured to treat clinical pseudopregnancy in the bitch and produced
a good clinical response and minimal adverse effects, however they are no
longer commercially available
19.9 THYROID DEFICIENCY
 hypothyroidism is said to cause infertility occasionally in the bitch
this may be via a delayed return to oestrus but in the author's experience this
is never the case unless there are clear clinical manifestations of hypothy-
roidism; assessment of thyroid hormone profles in clinically normal bitches is
therefore not warranted
 lymphocytic thyroiditis has been identified as a cause of infertility in beagles
and borzois
 there is no evidence that thyroid supplementation improves fertility in clinically
normal bitches
19.10 OTHER HORMONAL ABNORMALITIES
 to date there have been few descriptions of hormone abnormalities which cause
unusual behaviour or conditions in the bitch because:
(a)  the only hormones readily measured in the bitch are progesterone and
oestrogen
b]
 hormonal changes are so rapid that frequent sampling would be necessary
but impracticable; the assay of single samples is usually worthless (except
progesterone, see 5.9)
terms such as ^ovarian imbalance’ and *hormonal imbalance’ are meaningless
because they cannot be defined
Conditions thought to be caused by homonal abnormality
Mounting and thrusting bebawiour
 this occurs in both entire and neutered bitches
it may be more marked when other oestrous bitches are present
Abnormal Female Physiology and Endocrinology
217
there is no evidence that it is caused by an excess of androgens or any other
specific hormone change
it can be controlled by training
Urine marking
during pro-oestrus and oestrus it is common for bitches to pass small volumes
of urine frequently; they may also urinate on vertical objects
bitches may also do this when not in oestrus and even after neutering; it does
not indicate a hormonal anomaly
Urinary incontinence (see 26.1)
this may occur in older bitches which have been neutered
such bitches do not have lower oestrogen concentrations than other neutered
bitches (within the limits of sensitivity of the assays available)
 the reason why only some neutered bitches are affected is not known but may
relate to differences in gonadotrophin receptors within the urethra
many bitches respond to low-dose oestrogen therapy (see 27.2) or to drugs
which cause urethral muscle contraction (e.g. phenylpropanolamine)
Oestrogen-responsive dermatosis
 some neutered bitches develop a bilateral, non-pruritic alopecia, usually with
hyperpigmentation of the skin
such bitches cannot be said to be hypo-oestrogenic because plasma concentra-
tions are in the same range as other neutered bitches
Unwillingness to mate during oestrus
some bitches which are considered to be in oestrus by virtue of vaginal and
other changes will not allow mating
hormone concentrations have not been reported but are probably within the
normal range
the condition is usually psychological and seen in bitches which have had little
contact with other dogs
treatments include tranquillizers, exposure to a different male dog and artificial
insemination

20.1 HYPOGONADISM
rarely seen but a congenital (present at birth) problem of reduced secretion of 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) which results
in impaired spermatogenesis
may occur in cases of pituitary dysfunction
classical features are the very small size of the testes compared with the body
mass of the dog
serial blood sampling demonstrates that plasma LH, FSH and testosterone
concentrations are low
testicular fine-needle aspiration demonstrates an absence of spermatogenesis
but no inflammation
in some species the administration of FSH has been suggested to promote

20.2  POOR LIBIDO
 an infrequent problem manifest as an uninterest or unwillingness to copulate
unwillingness to copulate despite interest in the female is most commonly the
result of a previous poor experience at breeding, inexperience on behalf of the
dog or poor breeding management
 uninterest may be present in cases of hypogonadism and small testes will be
apparent
there is no evidence that in normal dogs reduced libido is the result of low
plasma androgen concentrations
 the administration of exogenous androgens is rarely curative, and importantly
testosterone and other androgens will have an inhibitory effect upon pituitary
semen quality [1]; androgens and anabolic steroids are contraindicated in
breeding male

20.3 ABSENCE OF SPERMATOGENESIS
the vast majority of cases seen in practice are a result of a previous insult to
the testes, i.e. these are cases of testicular degeneration/spermatogenic arrest
 an impaired or absent spermatogenesis is seen in cases of hypothyroidism
 in other species a variety of other primary causes of absence of spermatogenesis
are reported, including primary testicular failure, primary failure of sperma-
togenesis and Leydig cell failure; the occurrence of these conditions in the dog
is entirely speculation
 if a primary testicular abnormality were present then basal concentrations of
FSH and LH would be high
if a primary pituitary or hypothalamic abnormality were present then FSH and
LH concentrations would be low
it is also possible that low concentrations of plasma LH, FSH and testosterone
may occur secondarily to thyroid hormone deficiency
 histologically, the testes of many azoospermic dogs have tubular degeneration,
with normal or sparse numbers of Leydig cells
ejaculates contain no sperm, but where there is Leydig cell failure there will be
low androgen concentrations and these dogs do not ejaculate
it is possible that the synthetic androgen, mesterolone, may be useful in these
cases [2]
thyroid function should always be evaluated in cases of poor semen quality:
cases of hypothyroidism may benefit from supplementation; however, the prog-
nosis for fertility is often poor
20.4 OTHER CAUSES OF ABNORMAL
SPERMATOGENESIS
 a variety of conditions may result in abnormal spermatogenesis (see 17.3):
 testicular trauma resulting in both tissue damage and elevated
temperature
[b]
 testicular tumours resulting in endocrine changes and subsequent reduced
spermatogenesis
[c]
testicular ectopia resulting in increased testicular temperature
(d)
systemic hyperthermia
[e]
aplasia of testis or epididymis
[f)
scrotal trauma or eczema resulting in elevated temperature
[g]
testicular degeneration after orchitis, torsion or other inflammatory
conditions
(h)
autoimmunity resulting in spermatogenic arrest
[1]
unknown causes of spermatogenic arrest
(i)
endogenous endocrine disturbances
[k)
exogenous hormone administration (progestogens, oestrogens and andro-
gens; which may have been given to control sex drive, control prostatic
disease or promote libido) [1]
220
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 raised FSH and LH plasma concentrations have been reported in dogs with
spermatogenic arrest because of failure to respond to stimulation resulting in
a reduced feedback effect
20.5
IMPAIRED SPERMATOZOAL TRANSPORT
Accelerated passage through the epididymis
 in some species it is known that overuse results in accelerated transport of
sperm through the epididymis and the presence of immature sperm in the
ejaculate
normal healthy dogs can cope with one ejaculation per day for prolonged
the number of sperm ejaculated will decrease to a stable number called the
daily sperm production
short periods of time with a higher ejaculatory frequency or dogs with marginal
semen quality mating more than 5 times per week may result in immature
sperm appearing within the ejaculate
the immature sperm have proximal cytoplasmic droplets and generally are
thought not to be able to fertilize
small numbers of sperm with distal cytoplasmic droplets may represent acceler-
ated transport but this is not uncommonly seen in dogs with a normal mating
regime
Retrograde ejaculation
some dogs have an absence of sperm within the ejaculate and usually a small
ejaculate volume, this may appear at odds with the fact that there are normal
urethral contractions during semen collection
 catheterization of the bladder and microscopic examination of urine demon-
strates a large number of sperm which is the result of retrograde ejaculation.
 presumably the result of an incompetent bladder sphincter or uncoordinated
urethral contractions
sperm present within the bladder are often immotile, but may return to motility
and fertility after dilution with physiological saline, centrifugation, removal of
the supernatant and re-suspension
treatment may be attempted using sympathomimetic agents which aim to
increase bladder sphincter tone
NB: It is common to find low numbers of sperm within the urine as this is the
route for elimination of unejaculated sperm.
Abnormal Male Physiology and Endocrinology
221
Prostatic disease
dogs with prostatic disease may have large number of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils and bacteria in the ejaculate to which sperm may become attached
 the effect of sperm clumping appears not to have a significant impact upon
fertility
an impact upon fertility is no known
Jo uesue aau aseasp osrd o san u rinuun
hormonal preparations which themselves adversely affect semen quality
Synthetic glucocorticosteroid therapy
continual administration of glucocorticoids at high doses has a rapid deleteri-
ous effect on semen quality which is probably mediated in the epididymis
the effect of shorter-duration therapy and lower doses has not been
quantified
20.6 IMPOTENCE (INABILITY TO COPULATE)
many causes of poor libido are described (see 20.2)
inability to copulate may also occur as a result of a painful condition manifest
at the time of mating, including prostatic, penile or skeletal pain; in these cases
the dog will appear to be interested in a bitch in oestrus but will not be able
to mount, gain intromission or achieve a 'tie'
20.7 ATTRACTIVENESS TO OTHER MALE DOGS
 in juvenile males kept together often the subordinate male will be subjected to
mounting by males that are higher in the social hierarchy
occasionally, however, males become attractive to other males who may dem
 onstrate behavioural responses typical to those presented with a bitch in oestrus
some of these cases are entire males with a testicular tumour producing
oestrogen
 other cases occur in males many years after they have been castrated
in castrated males no hormonal cause has been identified, but circulating tes-
tosterone concentrations are low; it is possible that other adrenal-produced
oestrogens are responsible for the condition, although adrenal ultrasound
usually does not demonstrate a lesion
 some control of the problem can be achieved by administration of depot andro-
gens or even depot progestogens, which supports that fact that this is an
endocrine abnormality amenable to hormonal suppression

Abnormal Pregnancy
21.1  FERTILIZATION FAILURE
 failure of fertilization is most commonly the result of oocytes and sperm not
being present in the female tract together at the same time; this is usually
because the owner decides when to breed and may chose an inappropriate
mating time (see 11.1)
fertilization failure may be the result of an inherently poor semen quality
sperm that have been cryopreserved also have poor quality and a substantially
reduced period of survival in the female tract
 otherwise there are few reports of conditions that impact upon fertilization
 it is possible that an inflammatory disease of the uterine tube (called salpingitis)
may impact fertilization but there are few reports of this condition
rarely, anovulation may occur (see 19.4)
fertilization may be prevented by post-coital administration of oestrogens
21.2
EARLY EMBRYONIC DEATH
 loss of embryos before a diagnosis of pregnancy can be made almost certainly
 Occurs but the rate and time at which this occurs is not known
 most commonly this condition is seen in healthy bitches with cystic endometrial
hyperplasia; here an abnormal uterine environment allows bacteria that enter
the uterus at oestrus to persist and interfere with normal embryo
development
 both pregnancy rate and litter size are reduced in bitches with endometrial
hyperplasia compared with normal bitches; endometrial hyperplasia can be
diagnosed using diagnostic ultrasound (see 16.5)
there is limited evidence that administration of systemic antibiotic post mating
 may help resolve the endometrial inflammation and improve pregnancy rate
and litter size [1]
it is also thought that individual embryos may fail due to genetic
abnormalities

21.3 RESORPTION
 in the author's clinic we have found that resorption of one or more embryos
but continuation of the rest of the pregnancy occurs in up to 10% of pregnan-
cies and probably represents abnormal development of the embryo or competi-
tion of placental attachment sites (as the condition is more common in large
litters) [2]
resorption of an entire litter may also occur but is usually the result of an
infectious agent (these are detailed in 21.5)
resorption only occurs when an embryo fails before day 35
embryonic resorption can be detected by ultrasound examination (Figure 21.1)
ultrasound can also be used to predict resorption since embryos destined to
fail usually are slow to develop and grow at a slower rate than normal embryos
the author's clinic was the first to document with ultrasound normal embryonic
 growth rates for the dog; these growth curves are now widely used in clinical
practice to determine whether embr
os are normal or abnormal [3,4]
 resorbing embryos usually have an
gular outline, there may be separation
of membranes from the uterine wall, the yolk sac fluid becomes echogenic,
there may be inward bulging of the uterine wall, and ultimately the fluid will
disappear leaving a heterogenous region (Figure 21.2)
after embryonic death the fluids are resorbed into the bitch's circulation and
the tissues (membranes and embryo/fetus) become dehydrated and autolysed
bitches should be tested for canine herpes virus when complete resorption
occurs; vaccination at the next pregnancy may prevent the problem from occur
ring again and reduce the risk of abortion and fading puppy syndrome
Figure 21.1  Isolated embryonic resorption in a bitch. There is loss of the normal spherical
outline, inward bulging of the conceptual wall and increased echogenicity of the yolk sac
fluid. Five normal conceptuses were also present and these were delivered normally at
term. 7.5MHz tansducer.
Abnormal Pregnancy
225
Figure 21.2 Ultrasound image of pregnancy at 20 days; there is an irregular corrugated
appearance to the outline of the conceptuses; pregnancy failure by resorption occurred 3
days later.
with the exception of German shepherd and similar breeds which exhibit ovula
tion abnormalities and short luteal phase, the author does not believe that
resorption is commonly the result of progesterone deficiency
 in breeds where a short luteal phase occurs it may be feasible to monitor pro-
gesterone concentrations using an assay with high sensitivity; progesterone
 concentrations less than 2 ng/ml necessitates treatment with exogenous short-
acting progestogens (commonly oral altrenogest at 0.1 mg/kg is used although
this author has seen even this low dose cause urogenital abnormalities in devel-
oping fetuses and prefers to use 0.05 mg/kg)
21.4 UTERINE BODY PREGNANCY
 occasionally a conceptus develops in the body of the uterus and the placenta
becomes closely apposed to the cervix
 after about 30 days of pregnancy, blood from the marginal haematoma starts
to leak through the cervix
 bleeding is often of a small volume but can be severe resulting in anaemia in
which case medical pregnancy termination or an ovariohysterectomy may be
considered
ascending bacterial infection does not appear to occur
in a small number of cases the body pregnancy is expelled spontaneously; it is
remarkable that the cervix may open, uterine contraction cause expulsion, but
the remaining pregnancies are protected
 in bitches with uterine body pregnancies, the viability of the remaining preg-
nancies should be monitored using real-time ultrasound
21.5 ABORTION
there is no evidence to suggest that abortion may occur as a result of physiologi-
cal or minor nutritional stress; bitches must be severely ill before a pregnancy
is terminated, or there must be specific bacterial or viral infectious agents
226
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Bacterial causes of abortion
Brucella canis infection
Brucella is present throughout much of the world and although it is not currently
present in some countries, because of the wide international movement of bitches
for breeding purposes it must be considered an important differential diagnosis.
 bitches with Brucella often have generalized lymph node enlargement and
generally abort after day 35 of pregnancy; some cases suffer earlier embryonic
resorption
 aborted material (and semen from males) is highly infectious
 bacteraemia may persist for years and any response to treatment is poor
 affected animals should never be used for breeding
 the focus is best paid to careful screening of all animals before breeding
Miscellaneous bacteria
sporadic cases of abortion are found associated with Escherichia coli, Campy-
lobacter, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, haemolytic streptococci and clostridia
occasionally several bitches in a kennels are affected
it is assumed that these organisms persist in the uterus after mating or enter
via the cervix in later pregnancy
generalized malaise or infectious disease is rarely associated with abortion
the bitch usually expels all fetuses and membranes
 the fetal stomach is the best place to sample for bacteriology; bacteria found
here were ingested in utero
 broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment for aborting bitches is prudent until results
of bacteriology are known
 Brucella abortus has been known to produce abortion via infected cows' milk,
but this is now unlikely in many countries
Viral causes of abortion
Canine berpes virus
 in adult dogs canine herpes virus generally produces a few mild signs limited
to the respiratory or genital tract
 the uncomplicated disease may be unnoticed by the owner
 genital tract lesions are frequently raised nodules that are red in colour; these
are present within the vestibule and vagina of the bitch and also within the
 prepuce of the dog
 in the bitch lesions are evident at the onset of pro-oestrus, suggesting venereal
transmission is probably important
recrudescent virus shedding from the vesicular lesions may be stimulated by
the stress of pregnancy and parturition
Abnormal Pregnancy
227
infection in the bitch may be associated with infertility, abortion and stillbirths
infection of the pregnant bitch results in placental lesions and the infection of
the fetuses:
[a}
and mummifcation
[b] 
 infection during mid pregnancy results in abortion
[c]
 infection during late pregnancy results in premature birth
pups may become infected at birth, during passage through the vagina, and
subsequently die with widespread necrotizing lesions
 a small number of pups may survive such infection and in these signs of cerebel-
lar and retinal dysplasia have been observed, and in one case a late-onset (at
3 years of age) cerebellar degeneration has been reported
pathological changes in pups are often characteristic of canine herpes virus
infection, and virus can be isolated readily from these tissues
 infection in the adult dog often requires no treatment and the condition is
self-limiting
 in pregnant bitches supportive therapy during the abortion is required
in the pups, the disease is rapidly fatal and treatment is often unrewarding
bitches which have previously given birth to infected pups may deliver another
infected litter but later may deliver a normal litter
 resorbing and aborting bitches should be isolated from other pregnant bitches
 infected bedding should be removed and the environment disinfected
the initial source of the virus is oral, nasal or vaginal secretions (and possibly
preputial excretions)
the potential for viral transmission at coitus is uncertain; however, males with
reproductive tract lesions should not be used for mating
during oestrus or within the first 10 days after mating and a second vaccination
is given at approximately 55 days of pregnancy; high success rates of prevent-
ing pregnancy loss and fading pups have been achieved, re-vaccination is
required for each pregnancy
Canine distemper virus
in susceptible dogs a peracute form with sudden onset pyrexia and death may
occur
most infections result in primary respiratory tract or gastrointestinal tract signs
 some dogs may develop central nervous system lesions
some may develop hyperkeratosis of the pads and nose (*hardpad')
experimental exposure of pregnant bitches produces either:
clinical illness in the bitch with abortion, or
(b)  subclinical infection of the bitch and the birth of clinically affected pups
diagnosis is via postmortem, histopathology and virus isolation
there is no suitable treatment for the reproductive tract consequences of dis-
temper virus infection
228
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
vaccination is now performed using attenuated live virus vaccines as part of
annual or biennial programmes
Canine parwovirus
 canine parvovirus 1 has not been confirmed as a major cause of disease
 canine parvovirus 2 appears to have arisen as a host range mutant of feline
parvovirus
the virus may cross the placenta and affect pups which then develop acute
generalized infection and myocardial disease soon after birth
 a diagnosis may be made upon the clinical signs, supported by a leucopenia,
 and the identification of virus or viral proteins
 the reproductive consequences can be treated by supportive nursing of affected
pups, especially using fluid therapy and antimicrobial agents 
inactivated canine parvovirus vaccines are available, and recently live tissue
culture attenuated vaccines have been selected and are widely used as part of
 annual vaccination programmes
Canine adenovirus
canine adenovirus 1 is a highly contagious disease known to produce infectious
canine hepatitis
 the virus may cross the placenta during late pregnancy, resulting in the birth
of pups which rapidly develop signs of systemic infection similar to those
observed in older pups and adults
 some pups may be born dead whilst others are weak and die within a few days
of parturition
infection may be diagnosed upon the basis of the clinical signs, and virus
isolation
adjuvanted inactivated vaccines are available and in certain cases their single
administration can provide immunity for life
Protozoal causes of abortion
Toxoplasma gondi
this has rarely been implicated in canine abortion; the cat is the definitive host
infection may occur following ingestion of infected meat or the faeces of an
infected cat
it seems likely that pups are only affected if ingestion and the acute phase of
infection occurs during pre gnancy and there is transplacental infection (chronic
infection in the bitch is not passed to her fetuses)
 if abortion does not occur in the acute phase of infection it is possible that
 pups will be born with neurological signs

Abnormal Pregnancy
229
Abortion of unknown aetiology
 bitches with uterine disease may suffer embryonic resorption and it is feasible
that fetal abortion also occurs; uterine disease can be detected by ultrasound
 examination and this is best performed during the luteal phase when proges-
terone concentrations are high
there is no clear data to show that low plasma progesterone concentrations
cause resorption or abortion except in German shepherd and similar breeds
where an anovulation/short luteal phase syndrome has been reported
ingestion of toxic substances is rarely identified as a cause of abortion
although there are many potentially teratogenic substances, they are rarely a
cause of pregnancy failure in bitches
Partial abortion
there are several recorded cases of bitches aborting some pups and having
others normally at term; this appears most commonly in cases with a uterine
body pregnancy (see 21.4) [5]
the presence of live pups can be confirmed by ultrasound examination 
bacterial infection affecting the other foetuses
 it is inappropriate to consider the administration of progesterone or pro-
gestogens without measuring plasma progesterone concentrations; if supple-
mentation is considered this should be a short-acting oral agent administered
daily and therapy should be ceased 4 days before expected parturition other
wise parturition will be prevented
NB: Tetracycline antibiotics should not be given to pregnant bitches as they may
cause discoloration of the pups teeth. Ampicillin and amoxicillin are the safest
antibiotics to use during pregnancy.
Prevention of abortion
 in bitches with a history of abortion, the following may be tried:
[a]
broad-spectrum antibiosis immediately after mating to reduce bacterial
colonization of the uterus
[b]
broad-spectrum antibiosis (not tetracyclines) at the time of expected abor-
tion in the belief that bacteria enter the uterus via the cervix during
pregnancy
[c]
 progesterone supplementation in the belief that low progesterone concen-
trations result in abortion. This has never been proven except for German
shepherds and similar breeds and following oestrus-induction regimes.
Administration of progesterone or progestogens during pregnancy may
delay or prevent parturition, and may cause urogenital abnormalities in
the pups
230
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
21.6
FETAL ABNORMALITIES
a variety of fetal abnormalities may be present in utero
some of these are not compatible with survival and result in abortion
fetal normality and abnormality has been documented using real-time diagnos-
tic ultrasound (see 13.9)
 the author's clinic was the first to detail normal fetal growth rates and detection
of fetal abnormalities; data which are now in wide clinical use [3,6,7]
21.7 METROCOELE
rarely a loop of uterus can protrude through the inguinal ring and be positioned
under the skin in the inguinal region
 if the bitch becomes pregnant a swelling (conceptus) may start to develop in
this area
early detection of the problem may allow the uterus to be returned to the
abdomen surgically; if this is not noticed the uterus may be strangulated, even
if not parturition is impossible
 most commonly late detection occurs and hysterotomy or hysterectomy must
be performed
21.8 UTERINE RUPTURE
 most cases can be traced back to some obvious abdominal trauma during
pregnancy
cases may however be asymptomatic at the time
the pups which are expelled from the uterus die and become dehydrated (mum-
mified); even at this stage if there is no bacterial contamination there are no
clinical signs
mummified pups are sometimes discovered during routine examination or
laparotomy
the condition may also occur during parturition (see 22.9)
21.9
LOSS OF FETAL FLUID
normally fetal fluid is only lost after active signs of parturition have
commenced
 however in in late pregnancy this occasionally occurs spontaneously when the
bitch is suffering a hydrops condition (it is unknown whether this is hydrops
amnii or hydroallantois)
release of fluid does indicate that the cervix is open and the fetal membranes
have ruptured so this sign must be taken seriously as the pregnancy is
threatened
Abnormal Pregnancy
231
21.10
PREGNANCY DIABETES
increased concentrations of progesterone during pregnancy (and non preg-
nancy) causes increased concentrations of growth hormone which can have an
insulin antagonistic effect resulting in diabetes mellitus
clinical signs are polyphagia and polydipsia/polyuria, usually with a surprising
(to the owner) weight loss
this condition is reversible once progesterone concentrations decrease and so
treatment is usually not required
 in cases with severe clinical signs medical termination of pregnancy may be
necessary (see 27.8 and 27.9)
21.11
HYPOGLYCAEMIA
this condition is rare during pregnancy because elevated concentrations of
 progesterone result indirectly in peripheral insulin antagonism (see pregnancy
diabetes above)
however a primary hypoglycaemia has been reported in pregnancy which
appears to disappear after parturition
the aetiology is unknown but clinical signs are typical of hypoglycaemia: weak-
ness, collapse and ultimately coma

Abnormal Parturition and
Problems After Whelping
A normal birth is termed ^eutocia', whilst the word *dystocia' is used to describe
any problem which interferes with normal birth.
22.1 CLASSIFICATION OF DYSTOCIA
 Difficult birth is often described as being associated with obstruction or poor
uterine contractions.
Obstructive dystocia
this may occur because of problems of the dam or the fetus
Maternal dystocia
 caused by, for example, a narrow birth canal caused by a pelvic fracture or a
vaginal stricture
Fetal dystocia
 caused by for example, a large pup or malpositioned or abnormal pup
Uterine inertia (poor uterine contractions)
this may occur as a primary problem or secondarily following an obstructive
dystocia
Primary uterine inertia
 absence of uterine contractions and therefore absence of first stage parturition
 these cases seem to be associated with low plasma oxytocin concentrations

AbnormalParturition andProblemsAfterWhelping
233
the cervix relaxes but pups do not enter the vagina and there is no external
sign of parturition - if untreated the pups die
the cause is unknown but may be due to:
[a]
 a small number of pups (one or two) producing an inadequate stimulus
to initiate complete parturition
[b]
 a very large litter (or excess fetal fluid - *hydrops') causing overstretching
of the uterus and preventing myometrial contractions
[c]
insufficient calcium (subclinical eclampsia) in the myometrium; this may
be related to a dietary insufficiency, inadequate parathyroid hormone or
 a refractory parathyroid gland
[d]
unknown but inherited causes
Secondary uterine inertia
cessation of uterine contractions after they have started
presumably due to exhaustion of the myometrium or some of the factors
involved in primary inertia
[a]
secondary inertia early in second stage parturition usually follows an
 obstructive parturition dystocia (unproductive straining)
[b}
 secondary inertia later in second stage parturition may occur apparently
spontaneously after the normal birth of several pups. The length of time
for which uterine inactivity can be considered normal is impossible to
define; however, if treatment results in the birth of a dead pup, secondary
inertia can be retrospectively diagnosed
22.2
THE 'OVERDUE' BITCH (See 14.5)
it is important to remember that pregnancy length from the day of ovulation
is very tightly regulated in the bitch (65 +/- 1 day) but that mating both before
and after ovulation can achieve pregnancy and result in pregnancy lengths that
appear longer or shorter than expected respectively
 n  si a   sa   p a 
parturition is overdue; but pregnancy can be 72 days from mating to the onset
of parturition and still be normal
possible causes for the bitches that are thought to be overdue include:
[a]
early mating (see 12.1) in relation to the time of ovulation
[b)
 inaccurate information or calculation of expected whelping day
[c]
non-pregnancy
[d]
 pregnancy loss, e.g. resorption or abortion
for investigation of these cases, the mating date should be checked, pregnancy
should be confirmed by abdominal palpation, ultrasound and/or radiography
used to examine the pregnancy, blood progesterone concentration should be
measured, and an endoscopic or digital examination performed
234
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Examination of the presumed overdue bitch
Mating dates
examination of the breeding records will enable confirmation of the possible
dates of parturition
parturition may occur as early as 56 days or as late as 72 days after mating
however if mating was based on determination of the time of ovulation (for
example by measurement of progesterone [see Chapter 11]), parturition can be
expected 63 (+/- 1 day later)
Abdominal palpation
pregnancy may be confirmed by palpation of fetuses in late pregnancy; this
often gives little information about the time of expected parturition rather
simply confirms pregnancy
Clinical examination
 the clinical condition of the bitch is important and may influence intervention
decisions later especially if she is debilitated
presence of milk in the mammary glands is unhelpful as a clinical sign as this
 may also occur in pseudopregnancy
Ultrasoundexamination
ultrasonography will confirm pregnancy and the viability of those pups which
are accessible to the ultrasound beam
 ultrasonographic signs of fetal death include:
[a]
 absence of fetal heart beat (Figure 22.1)
[b]a
 absence of fetal movements
Figure 22.1 Ultrasound image of a dead fetus in utero. The fetal ribs (small arrows) and
scapulae (arrow heads) can be seen; however the fetal heart (H) has stopped moving and
no longer appears anechoic. 5.oMHz transducer, scale in centimetres.
AbnormalParturition andProblemsAfterWhelping
235
[c]
reduced volume of fetal fluid
[d)
 accumulation of gas in the fetal stomach or subcutaneously
ultrasound examination should be used to confirm fetal viability by counting
heart rates (which should be less than twice maternal); a reduction in fetal heart
rate is a common clinical sign that the pups are hypoxic
Radiograpbic examination
 radiography can be used to count the number of fetuses; indeed in late preg-
nancy this is more accurate than ultrasound examination
 radiography can also be used to confirm fetal death by noting:
[a]
 overlapping of the skull bones
[b)
accumulation of gas in the fetal stomach or subcutaneously
[c]
abnormal fetal posture
[d]
additionally, fetal bones in the bitch's stomach may indicate that she has
whelped/aborted and eaten the pups
however radiography is less sensitive than ultrasound for detecting fetal death;

Measurement of plasma progesterone
progesterone can be easily measured by ELISA in the practice laboratory and
results obtained within 45 minutes
 in the author's clinic we have shown that plasma progesterone concentrations
decrease 24-36 hours before parturition (Figure 22.2) [1]:
[a]
detection of high progesterone concentrations indicates that parturition is
not imminent
Days in relation to the onset of parturition

Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
[b]
begun
[c]
 intermediate progesterone concentration are difficult to interpret
Milk progesterone and ionic composition of milk
 in some species changes in progesterone in milk and increasing concentrations
of calcium can be used to predict the onset of parturition
 in the author's clinic we have shown that, although similar trends are present
in the bitch, the individual animal variation was too large to prevent this from
being clinically useful [2]
Digital or endoscopic examination
it is not possible to palpate the cervix digitally; however, endoscopic examina-
tion may allow inspection of the cervix and cranial vagina
[a]   t
 the cervix will be dilated and fetal membranes protrude once second stage
parturition has commenced
Treatment options for the presumed overdue bitch
 a number of treatment options are available depending upon the diagnosis
reached:
[a]
 non-pregnant animals need no treatment
[b]
if the bitch is not at term re-examination should be performed a few days
later
[c]
if primary inertia is suspected due to temperature fall (see 14.4) more than
48 hours previously, or evidence of placental separation (see 22.3), oxy-
tocin may be tried but caesarean operation is more successful
[P
if dead pups are identified, caesarean operation (oxytocin may be tried
first, but is unlikely to work)
22.3 BLACK/GREEN DISCHARGE WITH NO SIGNS
OF PARTURITION
 a haemorrhagic black/green discharge occurs when fluid escapes from the
d  s a h s d ae r r 
cental separation has begun
there are a variety of possible causes;
a]
primary uterine inertia with fetal (at least one) death and placental separa-
tion: this may be in a bitch known to be pregnant, or often in an aged
bitch which was not known to have been mated and has only conceived
onepup
Abnormal Parturition and Problems After Whelping
237
[b]  (
 death of all the fetuses in mid to late pregnancy followed by haematic
mummification; the cause is unknown and the pups may die at different
stages of development
 ultrasonography is the diagnostic method of choice; importantly counting the
fetal heart rate will provide useful information since in the normal fetus this is
more than twice or three times the maternal heart rate, a bradycardia indicates
fetal distress (essentially the normal chronic response of the fetus to hypoxia
is bradycardia)
 radiology may confirm fetal death but only several days after it has occurred
these cases are invariably treated by caesarean operation
22.4 NERVOUS INHIBITION OF PARTURITION
· in this case the bitch may be in first or second stage parturition but will not
settle to whelp properly and may have successive pups in different places, or
carry them about
 it is proposed that these occur when the bitch is acclimatized to the whelping
(n a 3'a) daqm oi aned riun ue oui 1nd si no ael oo xog
 ultimately it may be best to relocate the bitch and she will settle and whelping
will continue
the condition can be prevented by allowing the bitch to whelp where she wants,
ensuring that the owner is present until whelping is over, and preventing unfa-
miliar persons from attending the whelping
22.5 INEFFECTUAL STRAINING FOR OVER 1 HOUR
 it is important to recognize the differences between uterine contractions (see
during first stage parturition by careful observation of the bitch's flank) and
the second stage contractions, which are manifest by active abdominal pushing
  d  sd  s  a     i
hour from the expulsion of fluid and at least part of a fetus is presented within
the birth canal
 whilst the first pup may live for 6 hours after the onset of straining; subsequent
s jo s  e rap ou ae a  ap an sn
 ineffective straining with no progression usually indicates that the first pup has
not entered the bony pelvis/vagina, is slow to progress through the vagina, or
is obstructed within the vagina
Common presentations
Pup not entering the birth canal
may be associated with:
[a]

[d]
ventral flexion of the nose so that the poll of the head engages the pelvic
inlet
[e]
lateral deviation of the head and neck; may feel one leg in vagina
[f}
complete ventral deviation of head and neck
[g)
 pendulous abdomen where the pup cannot get up to pelvic inlet
[h]
dead pup
[(i)
maternal pelvic abnormality or rarely a uterine torsion
Pup within the vagina, but progressing slowly
may be associated with:
[a]
relatively large pup
[b]
 posterior presentation of first pup
[c]
straining not intense enough
Pup obstructed witbin the vagina
may be associated with:
[a]
tumour (polyp)
[b]
exostosis or pelvic bone misalignment following a previous fracture
[c)
congenital vaginal stenosis, usually due to a longitudinal band of tissue
which runs the length of the vagina; presumably such bitches become
pregnant without a ‘tie’ (see 9.4 and 9.5)
Clinical approach
 in all of these cases the mainstay of diagnosis will be careful digital examina-
tion (remember it is not possible to palpate the cranial vagina even in a small-
sized bitch) and ultrasound examination to confirm fetal viability
 possible findings from digital exploration of the vagina include:
[a]

caudal abdomen with the other hand may make palpation easier
[b]
fluid-filled amnion in vagina
[c]
part of a pup in the vagina
[d)
vaginal occlusion due to a polyp, exostosis or stenosis
treatment options include:
[a]
if nothing felt in vagina - caesarean operation
[b)
if amnion only felt - lift fetus transabdominally with other hand and
stimulate the dorsal wall of the vagina to cause contractions
[c]
if vaginal occlusion - caesarean operation
[d]
if fetal malposition - see Obstetrical manipulation (22.8)
AbnormalParturition andProblemsAfterWhelping
239
22.6 BITCH HAD SEVERAL PUPPIES BUT RESTLESS
ORLARGERLITTER EXPECTED
a variety of causes are seen of which secondary uterine inertia is the most likely
(exhaustion of the myometrium)
 it is possible that this is the normal rest between deliveries which can be very
long at the end of parturition especially if this is a large litter
 it is possible that all pups have been delivered
these cases should be investigated by digital exploration per vaginam and
ultrasound examination of the uterus
cases of secondary inertia will reveal undelivered pups which may or may not
be viable
as long as no obstruction is present oxytocin can be administered and the bitch
should be carefully observed for response to treatment
if there are signs of fetal stress (documented by reduced heart rate) or dead
fetuses are present then caesarean operation should be performed
22.7 OXYTOCIN TREATMENT
oxytocin causes rhythmic uterine contractions as long as it is given at the time
of parturition
 oxytocin has only a pharmacological effect if given more than 36 hours after
parturition
its half-life is short, but it can cause powerful contractions
small doses, e.g. 2-4IU, should be administered initially; if no effect is seen
after 10-20 minutes, the same or a larger dose may be given; it may be appro-
 priate to consider calcium administration at the same time as the uterus responds
 poorly if the bitch is hypocalcaemic
 if delivery of a pup is stimulated by oxytocin, administration may be necessary
for subsequent pups
 where many pups are still to be born, the use of caesarean operation should
be considered because although oxytocin may be effective it is likely that the
duration of parturition will be long and there is risk to the last pups
 oxytocin should not be given in obstructive dystocia or if the cervix is not
thought to be relaxed (this requires endoscopic inspection to accurately
document)
22.8 OBSTETRICAL MANIPULATION
 strict attention should be paid to aseptic preparation before undertaking any
examination
drying of the vagina should be avoided by using a water-soluble lubricant
it can be helpful to confrm that a pup is alive; this can be achieved because
most live pups make sucking movements when a finger is put in their mouths,
240
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
it may be possible to palpate a pulse or heart beat, or in some there may be a
withdrawal reflex when the toes are squeezed
 in most cases repositioning of the pup is best achieved with the pup retropulsed
into the birth canal, after correction of alignment traction may then be
provided:
[a] 
 by finger manipulations and by pushing the pup caudally using transab-
dominal manipulation with the other hand
[b]
the pup's head or hips may be gripped between the crooked index and
second fingers
[c]
flexed front legs and back legs (breech) may be reached by passing the
 index finger transversely over the dorsum (shoulder or pelvis) of the pup
and flicking the limb backwards; the procedure is repeated with the other
hand in bilateral flexions
d]
 a vectis forceps or a strong teaspoon may be used like a vectis; this cups
the dome of the head and is not likely to cause significant trauma
[e]
using whelping forceps, however these must be used with care to ensure
the vagina is not snared, the fetus is not inadvertently crushed or fetal
extremities are not amputated
if a pup appears to be *stuck', slight rotation may assist delivery
traction should be applied if possible whilst the bitch is straining
 pressure on the vaginal roof with the fingers may stimulate straining
caesarean operation should be considered if:
[a]
 no progress is made after 15 minutes
[b]
the vagina becomes traumatized
[c)
the bitch becomes distressed
[d]
 there are many pups yet to be born
NB: The decision to use caesarean operation is often difficult at the time and
retrospective analysis is always easy; the responsibility of the clinician is for the
comfort and life of the bitch and her pups. It is often quicker and safer to perform
a caesarean operation than to embark on obstetrical manipulation, particularly in
small bitches; relief of obstructive dystocia is often followed by secondary inertia.
22.9  UTERINE RUPTURE
this appears to occur in mid pregnancy (see 21.8) and also appears to develop
spontaneously at term
 pups are found alive or dead in the abdomen at laparotomy; rupture of the
uterus is evident
 the bitch may be systemically unwell with signs of polydipsia, vomiting, depres-
sion and pyrexia
diagnosis before surgery is often difficult
fetuses which have been in the abdomen for some time will be mummified and
may remain there for years
extensive abdominal adhesions may result
AbnormalParturitionandProblemsAfterWhelping
241
22.10
UTERINE TORSION
The published literature shows more bitches with uterine torsion were not preg-
nant rather than pregnant.
 in pregnant bitches the condition usually occurs in late pregnancy and most
commonly affects one horn
if there is vascular compromise the condition causes severe abdominal pain and
reluctance to move
can only be diagnosed at laparotomy
hysterectomy or hysterotomy may be performed depending upon the viability
of the uterus
22.11
RETAINED FETAL MEMBRANES
the condition is uncommon
the placenta is usually but not always passed within 20 minutes of each pup;
sometimes two or more pups are delivered before the placentas are expulsed
in many cases retention is suspected because not all placentas have been seen
by the owner, although two or more may have been delivered together, or may
have been eaten by the bitch
retention is usually suspected if a green/black discharge persists after
parturition
diagnosis is difficult and requires ultrasound examination  or clinical
experience
in suspected cases, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given
 Oxytocin has little effect after parturition because oxytocin receptors rapidly
disappear; low-dose prostaglandin treatment may be effective
metritis is a common complication
22.12
POST-PARTUM METRITIS
 metritis arises because of bacterial invasion of the uterus following parturition,
abortion, manipulation or placental retention 
there is normally a foul smelling red-coloured discharge from the vulva
the bitch becomes pyrexic, toxaemic, depressed, anorexic and milk production
decreases
 pups receive little milk, may not be nursed by the dam and often cry because
of cold and hunger
the condition may be fatal despite treatment which in the frst instance is
directed to control of the bacterial infection (e.g. by the use of intravenous
ampicillin or potentiated sulphonamide), replacing fluid loss (e.g. Hartmann's
solution) and encouraging uterine evacuation (e.g. administration of oxytocin
or prostaglandin)
242
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
it is best to collect a guarded swab from the cranial vagina so that, on the basis
  aq o e a s p ao jog
ovariohysterectomy may be considered if a pup is retained
uterine lavage with very dilute chlorhexidine via laparotomy has been described
but the uterus is very friable and may not be amenable to such an approach
22.13 POST-PARTUM HAEMORRHAGE
 a small volume of haemorrhagic discharge is common at parturition
 larger volumes of blood loss usually originate from uterus endometrial oozing
but may also be the result of physical injuries to the vagina
in these cases flesh blood is passed which clots
if a vaginal lesion is recognized a tampon may be useful to apply direct pres
sure to the site, otherwise an assumption is made that the bleeding originates
from the uterus and oxytocin and antibiotics are administered; uterine contrac-
tions result in an initial expulsion of blood and make the condition look worse.
nd e sod ii aq xo n ad q  aa
initial contraction of the uterus
 in bitches that do not respond to treatment a coagulopathy should be
considered
 blood transfusion and/or ovariohysterectomy may be considered
22.14
SUBINVOLUTION OF PLACENTAL SITES
 a haemorrhagic discharge is common for 2 weeks after normal parturition, and
a mucoid discharge will often be present for a few more weeks
 if a serosanguinous discharge persists, it is most probably due to subinvolution
of the uterus at one or more of the placental sites; haemorrhage continues from
the endometrium at the position of the marginal haematoma (see 12.4)
these bitch show no signs of malaise, and dilated regions of the uterus can be
detected using ultrasound imaging
generally persists but with declining blood loss until there is re-vascularization
at the subsequent oestrus
in one study a combination of progestogens and antibiotics was found to be
useful in a limited number of cases
subsequent fertility is not affected
 if bleeding is marked, the bitch should be examined for anaemia, which, if
 present, may necessitate an ovariohysterectomy
22.15 HYPOCALCAEMIA (PUERPERAL TETANY
OR ECLAMPSIA)
Although large studies have not been conducted it appears that hypocalcaemia is
most common in small breeds and is seen in early lactation or less commonly in
late pregnancy.
Abnormal Parturition andProblemsAfterWhelping
243
clinical signs are nervousness, panting, whining, hypersalivation and a stiff gait
there is frequently a marked pyrexia
if untreated, tonic or clonic muscular spasms may occur
 treatment is relatively simple by slow intravenous administration of 5-20 ml
10% calcium borogluconate; cardiac rate and rhythm should be monitored
during intravenous administration
 the same volume of calcium should be administered subcutaneously and some
n  s e n s pn u s
human antacid tablets
 it is best to try to feed the pups artificially for 24 hours after the acute episode
or to wean completely; if they are weaned completely a prolactin inhibitor
(cabergoline) can be given to stop lactation
 oral calcium supplementation may be tried in bitches at risk (those that have
previously had the problem) but this may depress parathyroid hormone pro-
duction and exacerbate the condition
22.16
CANNIBALISM
nervous (often inexperienced) bitches may neglect or kill pups if they are dis-
turbed, particularly by strangers
bitches may neglect individual pups; sometimes they have obvious defects, e.g.
small size, cleft palate
 excess licking may cause ulceration of the limbs etc. of pups
22.17F
PROLAPSED UTERUS
d nd a  sno io  an an si u s
when the cervix is open
it may be complete or incomplete in which case the bitch strains and the pro-
lapse can be palpated in the vagina
in cases of complete prolapse fatal haemorrhage may occur from the uterine
vessels
 laparotomy may be used to pull the uterus back into the abdomen
22.18
3FAILURE OF MILK LET-DOWN
 failure of milk let-down is more common than agalactia and is usually the
result of adrenalin release (due to stress or pain, for example, a caesarean
operation) which inhibits the oxytocin response
some cases may be associated with physical obstruction of the mammary col-
lecting system because of swelling of the gland
nous oxytocin (2IU/bitch up to four times daily)
these cases must be differentiated from agalactia
244
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
22.19
AGALACTIA
agalactia is an absence of milk; essentially a failure of milk production
 this can be temporary when milk production lags a few days behind parturi-
tion, or persistent when milk production is inadequate or inadequate for the
size of the litter
whilst milk production can be stimulated by administration of metoclopramide
a addns si anssi sodi sso au (ep sa o iy 1)
of the pups
encouraging the pups to suck even if there is no milk will encourage milk
production
these cases must be differentiated from failure of milk let-down
22.20
0MASTITIS
mastitis in the bitch is most commonly seen as an acute inflammatory condition
which may or may not have a bacterial aetiology
Types of mastitis
Commonly simply classified as acute or chronic.
Acute mastitis
most cases are acute bacterial mastitis and are seen within the period of lacta-
tion or shortly afterwards
 bacteria isolated are frequently commensal or environmental organisms which
seem to be introduced by trauma at sucking or associated with a dirty
environment
 the mammary gland is usually hot, swollen and painful (Figure 22.3), and the
milk is discoloured red or brown
 the bitch may have just local signs or develop systemic signs and in these latter
cases the changes in the milk may affect the pups (toxin milk syndrome)
some of these cases develop mammary abscesses; the gland may then become
cold and ulcerated (gangrenous mastitis)
Chronic mastitis
cases of subclinical mastitis are believed by some workers to be associated with
poor milk quality and failure of pups to thrive
 presumably chronic bacterial contamination of specific lobes occurs in these
cases
Treatment of mastitis
mastitis is usually treated symptomatically with broad-spectrum systemic anti-
biotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
AbnormalParturitionandProblemsAfterWhelping
245
Figure 22.3 Acute bacterial mastitis; the gland is hot, painful, swollen and discoloured.
whilst antibiotic penetration is usually good when the mammary gland is
 inflamed, levels of antibiotic can be improved by considering the milk pH: when
pH is less than 7.2 potentiated sulphonamide is a good choice; when pH is
more than 7.4 penicillins are a good choice
massage of the mammary gland with warm water and stripping of the milk are
important adjuvant tre atments
 in cases of mammary abscess, surgical drainage may be required
22.21
GALACTOSTASIS
 galactostasis is a build up of large amounts of milk within the mammary gland
 it is seen most commonly in bitches immediately after parturition before pups
are activiely sucking from all teats, in bitches that produce more milk than is
required, in bitches that are pseudopregnant, and in bitches after weaning
 in most cases the gland is swollen and warm but is not hot and painful, however
the condition may progress to mastitis
 in the short term stripping of the gland helps relieve the clinical signs but per-
petuates lactation
cold compresses and the use of prolactin inhibitors such as cabergoline are
required to reduce milk production

Care of the Sick Neonate
23.1 IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
 a number of factors can help reduce sickness in neonates including:
[a]
 maintenance of breeding records including details of the health status of
breeding stock
[b]
 good management during whelping and the immediate postnatal period
[c]
ensuring pups receive adequate colostrum
[d)
 recognizing the signs of ill health early
[e)
sending dead puppies for postmortem examination
23.2
SIGNS THAT THE NEONATE MAY BE SICK
 it is important to look for early signs of illness because once illness is established
 pups can be difficult to treat and mortality is high
a variety of typical clinical signs that are characteristic of illness include:
a]
being underweight with a thin, bony appearance and a slack abdomen
[b]
failure to suck
[c]
failing to gain weight at the normal rate or at the same rate as others in
the litter
[d]
 having cold and inelastic skin
(e)
a coat in poor condition
[f]
 persistent crying and possibly a loss of body twitching
 a useful clinical assessment tool has been developed from the ^Agpar’ score
used in human neonatology; the parameters that comprise the score include
heart rate, respiratory effort, mucous membrane colour, muscle tone and
response to stimulation (Table 23.1)
 there is good correlation between the Agpar score and the likelihood of
survival
 Other tests include detailed ultrasound examination of the pups’ organ systems;
these have been described in pups examined at the authors clinic [1]

23.3 TREATING A SICK PUP WITH MINOR SIGNS
OF DISEASE
         is
treatment to prevent progression of the disease
early supplemental feeding is the mainstay of early treatment
an adequate volume of colostrum or milk should be given every 2-3 hours by
feeding bottle or orogastric tube (see 15.4)
NB: The perineal region of each pup should be regularly stimulated to ensure
expulsion of urine and faeces.
body temperature needs to be maintained and should be recorded every few
 hours along with environmental temperature
hydration status should be checked and can be estimated from:
[a]
amount of weight gain (measured three times daily)
[b]
mucous membrane colour and skin elasticity (5-7% dehydration - mem-
branes are dry and tacky; 10% dehydrated - membranes are very dry and
the skin shows reduced elasticity)
(c]   
 urine colour (normal hydration presents as urine with no colour)
 pups with minor signs of illness are at risk of overgrowth of commensal bac-

TREATING A SICK PUP WITH SERIOUS SIGNS
OF DISEASE
once pups stop sucking they enter a downward spiral of dehydration, hypo-
thermia, bacterial overgrowth, ileus and circulatory collapse, and death can
quickly follow
248
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Figure 23.1 Pups that have serious signs of disease are best kept in a controlled
environment incubator.
some of these clinical signs complicate the condition and treatment (e.g. ileus
results in a bloated abdomen and reduces sucking further)
clinical signs that demonstrate a progressive decline in the pup include dehydra-
tion, persistent crying and failure to feed
immediate aggressive treatment aimed to reverse (1) hypoglycaemia, (2) hypo-
thermia and (3) hypoxia, and to treat or prevent (4) dehydration and (5) com-
mensal organism overgrowth is required
 throughout treatment intensive monitoring is required and should include:
[a]
assessment of mucous membrane colour and capillary refill time
[b]
measurements of rectal temperature
[c]
monitoring of respiratory and heart rate
[d]
examination of urine colour and skin elasticity
 pups are best maintained in an incubator (Figure 23.1) in an oxygen-rich
environment
Hypoglycaemia
pups have low glycogen reserves at birth and low functional capacity of the
liver
failure to suck result in hypoglycaemia in 24-36 hours
hypoglycaemia is serious and sadly response to glucose administration may be
poor
 common clinical signs include crying, tremors, irritability, increased appetite,
lethargy, coma and seizures
 glucose concentration can be evaluated using a glucose reagent stick or by using
a glucometer
 values of <30-40 mg/dl indicate hypoglycaemia and slow intravenous dextrose
administration is needed
dextrose is given at 0.5-1g/kg as part of a 5-10% solution of dextrose in
lactated Ringer's or normal saline, or by giving 1-2ml of 10-25% glucose
intravenously to severely depressed puppies
Care of the Sick Neonate
249
NB: Care must be taken to collect only a small sample of blood and use of an
insulin syringe is best for this. It is important to keep accurate records when taking
blood samples from puppies and to take no more than 10% of the puppy's circu-
lating volume in 1 week.
Hypothermia
is si sp m is a um s  ss an oq e
hypothermia causes reduced gut motility and ileus, leading to a bloated
abdomen
poor respiratory function, poor sucking and increased risk of bacterial infection
follow bloating
reversal of hypothermia requires slow warming, not exceeding 1*C per hour
using heat pads wrapped in towels, heat lamps or bottles, although care must
be taken to check the environmental temperature regularly to prevent
overheating
 pups should not be fed if their body temperature is less than 35°C and/or if
there are no bowel sounds
providing dextrose at the same rate as previously described can help meet the
increased calorific demand which results from the increase in metabolic rate
 associated with reheating
Hypoxia
hypoxia causes a failure to suck, decreases gut motility, and can lead to trans-
location of intestinal bacteria
sr rod jo aq sii osr e i ose si ar
function
 clinical signs include abdominal distension and increased respiratory effort and
rate
oxygen can be administered using a constant flow oxygen mask or by placing
the pup in a 30-40% oxygen environment using an oxygen tent
 a tracheal catheter can be used for endotracheal intubation in pups with upper
respiratory tract problems
intravenous administration of doxapram may stimulate breathing but has not
been proven to be efficacious
artificial ventilation may be useful to encourage lung surfactant production
(surfactants are proteins that reduce surface tension of fluid and allows lung
alveoli to expand)
Dehydration
dehydration can occur quickly and be fatal
 fluid should be administered to meet ongoing maintenance requirement (gener-
ally 60-100 ml/kg/day or 3-4 ml/kg/hour) as well as to replace the deficit
250
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 oral electrolytes may be considered in mild cases only when bowel sounds are
 present; generally intravenous, intraperitoneal or intraosseus administration is
required
NB: A typical neonate weighing 0.40 kg will require 1.4ml/hour maintenance.
Intravenous fluid administration
· the method of choice if possible and it is well worth spending the time to place
a catheter even if this requires cut down onto the vessel; this will only become
more difficult later on if the pup deteriorates
 over-the-needle catheters are the easiest to keep in position
the jugular vein may be preferable to the cephalic vein as it is less prone to
kinking
sterile site preparation is necessary
Intraperitoneal administration
often not used since dosing is required every 8 hours, recurrent needle place-
ment may cause sepsis and fluids are relatively slowly absorbed
Intra-osseus administration
useful if venous access is not possible; almost certainly preferable to intraperi-
toneal administration
usually performed via the medial aspect of the proximal tibia or the tro-
chanteric fossa of the femur (Figure 23.2)
 an intravenous over-the-needle catheter may be used when the cortical bone is
soft enough
 the catheter can be fixed and left in position for up to 72 hours; thereafter a
new catheter should be placed into a different bone to avoid fluid leakage
caused by repeated puncture
 fluid can be administered at the same rate as for intravenous infusion
General principles offuid administration
 in most cases it should be assumed that there is acidosis and an isotonic crys-
pabau si sneis uoipay an Aq pauaao asop e ie uoos prol
 fluid should be warm but not more than 1 *C above the puppy's current body
temperature
 the volume of fuid for immediate replacement should be approximately 3 ml/
kg bodyweight per hour and the risks of overhydration can be minimized by
regularly weighing
signs of overhydration are froth at the lips, increased heart rate, laboured
breathing, peripheral oedema and seizures
Care of the Sick Neonate
251
Figure 23.2 Placement of intra-osseus catheter via the trochanteric fossa and held in
place with surgical tape and four sutures to the skin.
Commensal bacterial overgrowth
 neonates that are compromised are at increased risk of bacterial infection
 ing broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, such as clavulanic acid potentiated
amoxicillin
it is always best to take bacteriological swabs but to treat whilst waiting for
results
23.5
CAUSES OF DEATH IN NEONATES
 all cases of neonatal mortality should be investigated with postmortem exami-
nation since, whilst there are many causes of death, some of these are important
infectious organisms which need to be identified so that appropriate control
mechanisms can be put in place
common causes of mortality include:
[a]
congenital defects
[b)
dystocia
[c)
injury
[d)
reduced immunity
[e)
infection (bacterial, parasitic or viral)
(f}
 illness or poor nutrition of the dam
(g)
poor maternal behaviour
[h)
poor husbandry
[i}
fading puppy syndrome
252
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
as discussed appropriate postmortem examination will result in diagnosis of
the cause in approximately 50% of cases
Infectious causes of neonatal death
overall approximately 20% of neonatal deaths result from infection although
this can greatly reduced with vaccination programmes and good husbandry
(especially vaccination against canine herpes virus where this is endemic) (see
21.5)
infectious agents include canine distemper virus, canine herpes virus and canine
 parvovirus. Certain bacteria are able to exploit the vulnerability of the neonate
and death can occur rapidly with few clinical signs
 infectious diseases normally progress rapidly and death can be common, but
 prompt action including testing the bitch for canine herpes virus antibodies
and for canine brucellosis and sending samples for microbial culture and sen-
sitivity testing may help prevent illness in the remaining littermates
Fading puppies
 pups that are sick regardless of the cause enter a downward spiral of failure
to suck, dehydration and ultimately death; these pups are said to fade
"fading puppy syndrome' is, however, a separate condition with similar clinical
signs but where the initiating cause is not apparent either clinically or at post-
mortem examination
fading puppy syndrome is responsible for 50% neonatal deaths
 affected pups generally appear normal at birth, have an average birthweight,
but start to fade from day 2, showing signs of depression, persistent crying,
poor sucking response, progressive weight loss and restlessness; most pups die
between day 3 and day 5 after birth
 it has been proposed that this syndrome occurs because pups have poor lung
surfactant production and therefore do not have adequate respiration which
results in a failure to suck
no treatment has been demonstrated to be effective but in a similar syndrome
observed in children improving respiration (using administered surfactant
and ventilation) is efficacious; potentially supportive therapy directed towards
as a  sd  pe aq  o s 
23.6(
COMMON CAUSES OF ILLNESS IN NEONATES
once pups are more than 5 days of age the risk of death from congenital defects
and trauma or infections acquired at the time of parturition reduces, however
the incidence of diarrhoea and respiratory tract infection increases
Care of the Sick Neonate
253
Diarrhoea
diarrhoea is the most common clinical complaint of neonates and it usually
multifactorial in origin
 often there has been limited or absent intake of colostrum, poor hygiene and/
 or introduction of specific infectious organisms
often coronavirus, rotavirus and Escherichia coli are isolated and there is com-
monly secondary bacterial involvement
the consequences of diarrhoea are rapid dehydration most pronounced in the
youngest animals, which can result in a fatal cycle of collapse and death
whilst the treatment will depend upon the particular cause the mainstay is to
(  a     s
Respiratory disease
 lower respiratory tract disease is not uncommon in puppies and is usually
manifest as lethargy, weakness, coughing and anorexia
it is commonly the anorexia that starts the pup on the fatal cycle of decline
and, again, whilst treatment depends upon the particular cause, management
of the anorexia at an early stage (tempting pups to eat using warmed foods of
high palatability) is crucial to stabilizing these cases

Approach to Infertility Cases
24.1
DEFINITIONS
 there is some confusion around the terminology used to describe whether an 
animal is able to produce offspring or not, particularly with reference to the
term infertility. The following definitions are helpful:
 Fertility: capability of producing offspring
Sterility: absolute inability to produce offspring
Infertility: a reduced ability to produce ofspring which is below the normal
for that species or breed (strictly this word is synonymous with sterility but
in recent years its use has changed as indicated)
Subfertility: a less than average ability to produce offspring; sometimes used
synonymously with infertility
24.2
EXPECTATIONS OF FERTILITY
not all matings between a fertile male and a fertile female result in a
pregnancy
this introduces the concept of pregnancy rate, which is the number of bitches
that get pregnant per oestrus cycle they are mated at
whilst bitches may become pregnant there is also the possibility that the number
of pups born can be normal or low
overall approximately 80% of normal bitches that are mated produce pups
and the litter sizes vary greatly in different breeds
 neither bitches nor dogs are often exploited for maximal production, so that
ideal total pup output cannot be defined
'pp oi paeiau insn si uonnd dnd jo ae an siaux suaaq u
which may be influenced by time of year or other factors
 for the veterinary surgeon the earliest definition of a fertility problem is when
the owner of either dog, bitch or kennels is disappointed by results; often the
owner has eliminated some of the possible causes so that questions regarding
previous breeding history should be put tactfully

24.4 TREATMENT OF INFERTILITY IN THE BITCH
Delayed puberty and long inter-oestrus
consider establishing karyotype
consider oestrus induction (see below)
 if this is unsuccessful, consider exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy to check
for the presence of ovaries
Oestrus induction
a variety of pharmacological regimes have been used, however the most effec-
tive available in clinical practice are the prolactin inhibitors
Prolactin inhibitors
apparently normal and fertile oestrous periods may be induced in anoestrous
bitches following daily administration of cabergoline
the time to the onset of induced oestrus seems to relate to the stage of anoestrus;
se ea un aso  b ao posan sse ae u s
an an iq aa aq osie i sd pe a ui is s
period is longer and pregnancy rates are low
for bitches when treatment starts in anoestrus, the induced oestrus appears to
be physiological, and whilst the mechanism of action is uncertain it may be the
result of inhibition of remnant progesterone production by the corpora lutea
Gonadotrophin releasing-hormone agonists
 GnRH superagonists (deslorelin) are available and may be useful for initiating
release of FSH and LH
careful attention needs to be paid to the duration of treatment since after initial
stimulation there is subsequent receptor down-regulation
 generally deslorelin is administered as an long-acting implant placed subcutane-
ously; a sero-haemorrhagic vulval discharge usually occurs within 5 days of
administration at which point the implant should be removed
 relatively normal pro-oestrus and oestrus follow and pregnancy rates are good
although some bitches have a shortened luteal phase that may result in resorp-
tion or abortion
Gonadotrophins
repeated doses of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) given to anoestrous
bitches stimulates follicular growth and the production of oestrogen:
a]
ovulation may occur spontaneously, following an endogenous surge of
LH
258
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
[b]
(hCG) which is LH-like in activity
these regimes are more effective in late anoestrous bitches compared with those
in early anoestrus
 care must be observed when using eCG and hCG combinations because endog-
enous hyperoestrogenism may occur and result in inhibition of implantation,
bone marrow suppression and death
 low doses of gonadotrophins are suggested to produce more physiological
plasma oestrogen profles [3]
a relatively low plasma progesterone concentration or short luteal phase fol-
lowing gonadotrophin-induced oestrus is common; this effect might be medi-
release of the luteotrophic gonadotrophin LH
Oestrogens
 low doses of oestrogen enable follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate
the formation of luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors on granulosa cells and
therefore increase the responsiveness to basal concentrations of LH:
[a]
 the result is follicular growth and production of oestrogen
[b]
gonadotrophin concentrations are low due to the negative feedback effect
[c]
 as follicles mature their walls luteinize and progesterone is produced
d]
 the decline in the oestrogen:progesterone ratio facilitates the preovulatory
LH surge
 the induction of oestrus with diethylstilboestrol has been used clinically for
some time
 in one study when diethylstilboestrol was administered until 2 days after the
onset of pro-oestrus and ovulation was ensured by the administration of FSH
and LH all bitches became pregnant and whelped normally
subsequent studies have not, however, been as successful, although more
recently diethylstilboestrol alone produced good results
Inability to mate
ensure that the bitch is properly in oestrus
eliminate physical obstructions as a cause of pain at the time of mating
familiarize the bitch with the mating environment
 consider using a different dog that is less (or more) dominant
consider using an anxiolytic or sedative agent
consider artificial insemination
Failure to conceive after normal mating
choose a fertile dog
 consider investigating thyroid function
Approach to Infertility Cases
259
perform a complete pre-breeding investigation including ultrasonography of
the uterus to rule out uterine disease such as cystic endometrial hyperplasia
ascertain that mating occurs at the right time at the next oestrus (see Chapter
11)
 ensure that bacterial colonization of the uterus does not occur by administering
a 4-6-day course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic after mating; it has not been
 proven that this problem occurs (see 16.5) and the aim is to limit proliferation
 of commensal organisms
consider exploratory laparotomy to ensure the presence of a normal uterus,
oviducts and ovaries
routine bacteriological screening has little role in investigation of these cases
NB: Since the timing of oestrus and the timing of ovulation during oestrus can be
quite erratic in normal bitches, few decisions can be made in the light of the previ-
ous breeding history.

try a different bitch
minerals, vitamins and homeopathic remedies have not been shown to be effec-
tive but probably do no harm
 do not give androgens or gonadotrophins as they are not effective and may be
detrimental to spermatogenesis
 in dogs with musculoskeletal problems having no hereditary component try
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
Failure to achieve conception
 ensure that the dog is mated with a proven’ bitch
perform breeding soundness examination and collect and evaluate semen
quality (see Chapter 10 and 17.3) [4,6]
Morpbological abnormalities (teratozoospermia)
may occur following pyrexia, and resolves quickly (within 60 days) of this
event
 minor or major abnormalities in semen quality may be the result of drugs or
toxins affecting spermatogenesis or the epididymal phase of development.
Drugs known to have a deleterious effect include:
[a]
 androgens
(b)
oestrogens
[c]
corticosteroids
[P]
 GnRH agonists and antagonists
[e]
ketoconazole
occasionally seen in the early stages of spermatogenic arrest when the principal
abnormality relates to thickening of the mid piece
an inherited mid piece defect that develops after 4 years of age has been rec-
ognized in certain breeds, e.g. springer spaniels
may occur in the early stages of testicular degeneration secondary to some other
pathological process
in the author's clinic we demonstrated improvement in semen quality by the
administration of the synthetic androgen, mesterolone, to these cases [7]
Abnormalities of spermatozoal number (oligozoospermia)
 obstruction of the epididymides or ductus deferens is rare but may be diagnosed
by measuring epididymal markers in the ejaculate; there is currently no suitable
tre atment
may occur in dogs treated with exogenous steroids that have a negative feed-
 back effect upon the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
 similarly seen in the early stages of dogs with Sertoli cell tumours that secrete
oestrogen [8]
262
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
    e iso r  s  s
azoospermic
seen in dogs with retrograde ejaculation, although usually no fluid is ejaculated
in these cases
Absence of spermatozoa (azoospermia)
seen in the end stage of testicular disease, e.g. following testicular degeneration,
autoimmune orchitis, orchitis
found in dogs with testicular hypoplasia
 found in dogs with bilateral outflow obstruction
 there is no treatment
Abnormalities of spermatozoal motility (asthenozoospermia)
frequently related to abnormal spermatozoal morphology, i.e. mid piece
abnormalities
 may occasionally be seen in dogs with sperm-sperm agglutination
 no suitable treatment has been described
Abnormalities of spermatozoal morpbology, number and motility
(oligoasthbenoteratozoospermia)
may occur during testicular degeneration
 observed in many of the above listed pathological processes
24.7 INFERTILITY IN KENNELS
The problem
usually more than one male dog involved, although in many cases the clinical
history is more anecdotal rather than accurately documented
male dogs from outside the kennels (and not known to be infertile) may be
involved
there may be longer than expected interval between successive periods of
oestrus
adxa nd  r ae n ao  s 
the outcome is that the rate of pup production is significantly reduced
there may be an increase in the production of dead pups at term
 the death rate of pups during the frst week (fading pups) may increase
 the problem may occur gradually or suddenly in established kennels with previ-
ous satisfactory fertility
Possible causes
in some countries the conditions is caused by canine herpes virus infection or
Brucella canis infection
Approach to Infertility Cases
263
in the absence of these organisms no other cause been proven; in most cases
there may be a combination of aetiologies
 importantly if the condition is associated with abortion, stillbirths and fading
pups then testing for canine herpes virus should be instigated
Possible treatments
eliminate the male dog as a cause, i.e. semen evaluation 
ensure that management factors are adequate; that oestrus is being detected
and bitches are mated at the appropriate time
 Oestrus induction may be considered where the inter-oestrus interval is
prolonged
investigate general hygiene and puppy care, especially in cases of fading puppies
when abortion or stillbirths occur pathological investigations of each pup
should be performed, serological examination of the bitch may be appropriate;
  d   n  r a  
 a  sd an   ae s a 
this has not been identified as a cause of the problem
24.8 WHY DO WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT INFERTILITY
IN DOGS?
Lack of pressure
 the maximal breeding potential of bitches is rarely exploited due to lack of
demand
 compared with other domesticated animals, low fertility is tolerated
 because most dogs are not bred for commercial interests, many infertile animals 
are not investigated
 dogs are often selected for looks or performance, not for fertility
usually advice is only sought when the patient is a champion or the “last of a
line'
owners are often reluctant to admit to a fertility problem in their dogs because
they are worried that others will presume the condition is infectious or
inherited
Difficulty of investigation in the bitch
knowledge concerning the significance of vaginal bacteria is usually misin-
formed (see 5.5 and 16.3)
digital examination of the whole vagina is impossible, even in large bitches
visual examination of the whole vagina is very difficult (see 5.7)
catheterization of the cervix for visualization, swabbing and biopsy of the
endometrium is difficult
264
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
radiography of the vagina and uterus is only possible using contrast media,
and information gained from the uterus is not interpretable at the moment
 ultrasonography of the uterus in the absence of gross distension is confined to
the distal body where it passes over the bladder (see 5.8)
 ultrasonography of the ovaries is very difficult, but is possible during oestrus;
few pathological changes have been described; this situation will shortly change
following the author's recent published work on follicular dynamics [9]
in order to detect hormone abnormalities, bitches would need to be bled at
least twice daily over the period when suspected malfunction was to occur; this
 is usually impractical and expensive
in order to detect anomalies of pregnancy development, repeated ultrasono-
graphic examinations would be necessary; this would be expensive
Difficulty in investigating the dog
 semen collection and identification of dogs with poor semen quality is easy
obtaining stud dogs for further investigation, particularly castration and exami-
nation of testicular tissue, is very difficult as owners do not usually wish to
donate this material
 investigation of possible methods of improving fertility in dogs is diffcult
because the owners of infertile dogs do not wish them to be used for research

Hormonal Contraception
 unwanted pets are a major social and sometimes ecological problem. They may
result in spread of zoonotic disease, cause pollution and damage public areas,
 livestock and pose an injury risk man. Millions of unwanted pets are destroyed
each year
 the permanent solution to controlling unwanted breeding is surgical
contraception
 the use of hormones as contraceptive agents is widespread, and these are often
given to bitches that are not cycling to pre vent the occurrence of the subsequent
oestrus, or once pro-oestrus has begun to suppress that particular cycle
hormonal control of breeding is not widely practised in dogs but details of
methods available are given in Chapter 27
see Chapter 27 for adverse effects of exogenous hormones

overcome with the use of longer-acting implants that are currently in

Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
not recommended for suppression of the first oestrus
some progestogens, e.g. medroxyprogesterone acetate, may cause mammary
neoplasia
use of GnRH agonists like deslorelin cause initial stimulation which results in
signs of oestrus
25.3 SUPPRESSION OF A PRO-OESTRUS THAT HAS
ALREADY STARTED [1]
Inject a long-acting progestogen
progestogens are the only suitable drugs that can be used for oestrus
suppression
for example injection of proligestone early in pro-oestrus is very effective
signs of pro-oestrus usually disappear within 5 days of administration
 if given late in pro-oestrus, may predispose to pyometra due to increased pro-
gestogenic influence on the uterus that has received oestrogen priming and also
the cervix will have been ‘open' for a longer period of time and as a result
bacteria may be present in the uterus
         
NB: Occasionally an area of alopecia develops over the injection site; for this
 reason the manufacturers recommend injections on the medial aspect of the flank-
fold in show dogs.
Administer an orally active progestogen
 for example, an 8-day course of megestrol acetate commencing early in
pro-oestrus
signs of pro-oestrus usually disappear within 2-3 days after the start of the
course
if given late in pro-oestrus it is theoretically less likely than a long-acting pro-
 gestogen to predispose to pyometra because the course of drug administration
is shorter
oestrus may recur any time after 4 months later
25.4 PREVENTION OF AN EXPECTED
PRO-OESTRUS/OESTRUS [1]
 sometimes an expected oestrus is likely to coincide with a social or another
Event which makes management of the oestrous bitch difficult, or the owner is
planning long-term contraception
Hormonal Contraception
269
treatment should be given in anoestrus, i.e. more than 2 months after the end
of the previous oestrus; because the length of anoestrus is very long and vari-
able in the bitch, the timing of the treatment is governed by the time when
oestrus is to be avoided
Subcutaneous administration of depot preparations
during anoestrus
depot progestogens (medroxyprogesterone acetate, delmadinone acetate, pro-
ligestone) administered during anoestrus will prevent a subsequent oestrus
 medroxyprogesterone acetate and proligestone are licensed for this purpose in
the bitch
Oral administration of progestogens during anoestrus
· low doses of orally active progestogens (megestrol acetate, medroxyprogester-
 one acetate, norethisterone acetate) can be used to prevent oestrus for as long
as administration is continued
 megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate are licensed for this purpose
in the bitch
·should the animal enter pro-oestrus during the first few days of treatment, the
dosage can be increased
a period of anoestrus usually follows therapy so oestrus does not return imme-
diately after cessation of treatment
Oral administration of synthetic androgens during anoestrus
a synthetic androgen, mibolerone, which is not available in the UK, is effective
for the prevention of oestrus in bitches
mibolerone is formulated as a liquid for daily oral administration
mibolerone has adverse effects typical of other androgens, including clitoral
hypertrophy, vaginitis and behavioural changes; in addition, anal gland abnor-
malities, obnoxious body odour and obesity have also been recorded
Administration of depot androgens during anoestrus
injection of mixed testosterone esters may be used to prevent oestrus in bitches
Administration of a GnRH agonist
administration of a high-dose GnRH superagonist implant (deslorelin at
 ssa j aai ad r ais aq A g exde
bitches when they are implanted in deep anoestrus
270
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 there may be period of behavioural oestrus shortly after implantation because
of the initial stimulation produced before receptor down-regulation
 implants need to be inserted approximately every 5 months
·adverse effects are minimal
NB: Deslorelin implants used for oestrus induction are removed when signs of
pro-oestrus occur, whereas for oestrus suppression the implants are left in place.
25.5 PREVENTION OF REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR
FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME [1]
It may be convenient to prevent reproductive behaviour for a long period of time
when the ultimate aim is still to breed from the bitch
Subcutaneous administration of depot preparations
during anoestrus
 medroxyprogesterone acetate and proligestone are licensed for this purpose in
the bitch
they are normally given at 3, 4 and thereafter 5 month intervals for prolige-
stone, and 6 month intervals for medroxyprogesterone acetate
it may be inadvisable to prevent oestrus for more than 2 years, but providing
that a breakthrough cycle does not occur, prolonged prevention may have few
adverse effects, especially when using the more recently developed progestogens
(proligestone); it has been reported that incidence of pyometra and mammary
tumours is reduced compared with untreated females 
when therapy is ceased most females cycle normally, although progestogens
may induce cystic endometrial hyperplasia and therefore reduce fertility
Short courses of orally active progestogen
for example, megestrol acetate courses are given at the beginning of each
pro-oestrus
the advantage of such treatment is that progestogen is only given for short
 periods of time; in some bitches this may be as infrequently as every 8-12
months
 the disadvantages are that signs of pro-oestrus must be looked for, and the
inconvenience of a few days of pro-oestrus must be endured
other possible side-effects are discussed in 27.1
a period of anoestrus usually follows therapy so oestrus does not return imme-
diately after cessation of treatment
Hormonal Contraception
271
Oral or depot administration of androgens during anoestrus
 mibolerone is effective for the long-term prevention of oestrus in bitches
often depot androgen therapy (e.g. mixed testosterone esters) is supplemented
by daily oral therapy, e.g. testosterone esters are given intramuscularly every
4-6 weeks, with supplemental daily oral testosterone
 adverse effects are more common with prolonged therapy
androgens are given at regular intervals to greyhound bitches to prevent oestrus
because:
[a]
bitches in oestrus cannot race because they would attract male dogs
[b]
bitches in early metoestrus, i.e. for 10 weeks after the beginning of pro-
oestrus, should not race because the high circulating concentrations of
progesterone at this time depress performance and make racing predict-
ability difficult
the possible anabolic effects of these preparations appear not to be marked
enough to enhance racing performance
there are no known untoward effects on subsequent fertility (see 27.3)
 drugs must not be administered to greyhounds during the 7 days before racing
Administration of a GnRH agonist
repeated administration of deslorelin implants approximately every 5 months
 appears to be reasonably effective as described above but these products have
 not received marketing authorisation for this purpose
25.6
FUTURE METHODS OF PREVENTING OESTRUS
Immunization
GnRH may provide an effective means of contraception
 a reliable GnRH protein conjugate antigen has recently been developed
 such methods require further investigation before they become clinically useful
25.7 UNWANTED MATING
Definitions
Misalliance: is defined in man as an unsuitable marriage
Mesalliance: is defined as an unsuitable marriage between two people of different
social backgrounds
NB: In dogs either term is used to describe an unwanted or unplanned mating;
probably these are more appropriate terms.
272
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
The clinical problem
typically the bitch is presented with a history of:
[a]
having been caught “tied’ with a dog
[b]
having been 'seen' with a male dog
[c]
 having escaped for some time and perhaps returned with saliva on her
neck, etc.
therefore in many cases it is not known whether mating has occurred or not;
a study in the USA suggested that 50% of bitches presented for unwanted
mating had not actually been mated
treatments for unwanted mating either have potential adverse effects or are
costly
Examination of the bitch following presumed unwanted mating
the “blind’ treatment of all bitches presumed to have had an unwanted mating
may, in certain circumstances, be appropriate
 a more satisfactory approach is the careful examination of bitches and the
clinical evaluation of the bitch should involve:
a]
the collection of a vaginal smear to evaluate the stage of the oestrous cycle
and to try to detect spermatozoa
[b]
the use of a modified vaginal smear technique to detect spermatozoa
c]
the measurement of plasma concentration of progesterone to establish
accurately the stage of the oestrous cycle
Vaginal cytology
collection and study of exfoliative vaginal cells may determine the stage of the
oestrous cycle (see 5.5)
 these results should be used in combination with measurement of plasma con-
centration of progesterone
in recently mated bitches, spermatozoa may be identified within the vaginal
smear
 there is however a rapid reduction in the number of spermatozoa and they may
not be identified if the interval from mating exceeds 24 hours
three possible cytological classifications occur:
Bitches that are found to be in cytological pro-oestrus
 in these cases plasma progesterone concentrations are low
 such bitches may not have been mated, since mating is usually refused at this
time, and therefore do not warrant treatment
however, this is not always the case, and some early matings may result in a
pregnancy if the spermatozoa are able to remain viable within the female
reproductive tract until after ovulation
Hormonal Contraception
273
assessment of the presence or absence of spermatozoa is therefore essential in
these cases
Bitches that are found to be in cytological oestrus
 in these cases plasma progesterone concentration is usually intermediate or high
such bitches may have been mated, and in most cases should receive
treatment
 reference to the presence or absence of spermatozoa may influence whether
treatment is instituted
Bitches that are found to be in cytological metoestrus (dioestrus)
· in these cases plasma progesterone concentration is high
such bitches may have been mated and should be examined for the presence
of spermatozoa
 the most important factor is, however, the time interval from mating to exami-
nation, because it is rare for matings occurring after the onset of cytological
metoestrus (dioestrus} to be fertile
Plasma progesterone measurement
plasma concentrations of progesterone can be measured by ELISA techniques
(see 5.9]
[a)
 concentrations are low during anoestrus and pro-oestrus
[b]
concentrations increase when pre-ovulatory follicular luteinization occurs
[c] 
there is a rapid rise in progesterone concentration after ovulation
 progesterone concentrations should be interpreted in the light of the clinical
history and assessment of vaginal cytology
Detection of spermatozoa within the vagina
from 24 hours after mating there are few spermatozoa within the vagina
accurate detection of spermatozoa requires a modified cytology technique
 a saline-moistened swab should be placed into the vagina for 1 minute
after removal the swab tip should be placed in a small test tube with 0.5ml
physiological saline, and allowed to stand for 10 minutes
 the swab is then squeezed dry, and the test tube containing the saline is centri-
fuged at 2000 rev/min for 10 minutes
 collection of the sediment and microscopic examination after staining with a
modified Wright-Giemsa stain allows detection of sperm heads
using this technique, spermatozoa are found in 100% of samples in which
mating occurred within the previous 24 hours, and in 75% of samples in which
mating occurred within the previous 48 hours

Treatment options
there are several treatment options, even when mating has occurred at a time
likely to result in conception:
a]i
if the bitch is not required for breeding ovariohysterectomy should be
performed in week 4 after the end of oestrus (at a time when pseudopreg-
nancy will not be induced)
b]
the bitch may be treated in an attempt to prevent implantation
[c]
the bitch can be re-examined approximately 28 days after mating to
establish if a pregnancy is present before instituting therapy. If a preg-
 nancy is identified it may be terminated by inducing resorption or 
abortion
(Table 25.1)
Prevention of implantation
Progesterone antagonists
aglepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist that has a greater affinity for
the receptor than progesterone does; administration displaces progesterone
from its receptor so there is no biological action of normal progesterone
concentrations
 in essence the effect of progesterone which would normally maintain the devel-
oping conceptus is removed and the pregnancy does not establish
aglepristone is administered in two doses 24 hours apart; in giant breeds a high
volume of drug needs to be injected and this has to be distributed into several
injection sites
Hormonal Contraception
275
apart from injection site reactions there are few adverse effects; in most cases
the bitch appears never to have been pregnant
Oestrogens
oestrogens are thought to have several effects that prevent implantation:
[a]
 they may alter the transport time of zygotes
(b)  they may impair implantation
[c] 
o uan ue aq sison ann a a
(d)  they may stimulate uterine contractions and cervical relaxation
in the UK until recently; it is no longer available
oral ethinyl oestradiol may also be effective
low dose oestradiol injected on day 3 and 5 (and also possibly 7) after mating,
has been found to be clinically effective and has a failure rate and complication
rate that is deemed acceptable
 approximately 9% of bitches treated with oestrogen develop pyometra within
the subsequent 4 months
much of the information on oestrogen treatment in bitches appears to be
anecdotal
little scientific interest has been shown into the mode of action of the oestro-
 gens, the optimal dose rate and time of treatment to prevent conception, and
the rate of success
clinically, oestrogen seems to be effective at preventing conception, but:
[a]
 o qd aram  a i s a
[b]
some bitches may have been mated at a time when conception could not
occur
possible reasons for treatment failure:
[a]
earlier mating than was originally thought, so that treatment is too late
[b]
the shorter half-life of oestradiol compared with diethylstilboestrol, may
in some cases allow its effects to have worn off by the time that ova enter
the uterine tubes; dog sperm can probably remain fertile for up to 7 days
in the bitch genital tract (see 11.2)
[c】
-s ai j 'saseo iso u aea rae ue paii aq e yiq a
diol is given around the ovulation period, this will not matter because
even though oestrus may be prolonged, no new ovulations will be stimu-
lated; if, however, a bitch is treated in pro-oestrus, the drug may have
been metabolized by the time of second mating and ovulation
 second matings should, however, be discouraged in treated dogs as these may
introduce bacteria into the uterus and predispose to pyometra
repeat injections during the same heat should be discouraged as these probably
increase the chances of side-effects (see 27.2)
adverse effects of oestrogens include:
[a]
 oestrogens may potentiate the stimulatory effects of progesterone on the
uterus producing cystic endometrial hyperplasia
276
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
[b]
oestrogens cause cervical relaxation, thus allowing vaginal bacteria to
enter the uterus
[c]
these two events may result in the development of pyometra
[d]
 oestrogens also produce dose-related bone marrow suppression
e]
other effects include alopecia, skin hyperpigmentation and mammary and
vulval enlargement
NB: It is prudent to perform a pregnancy diagnosis at 28 days post mating after
any treatment to pre vent implantation to ensure that pregnancy is not maintained;
if it is then the treatment options below are available.
Termination of pregnancy
 once pregnancy has become established it may be terminated either by altering
the endocrine environment or by ovariohysterectomy which may be safely
performed in week 4 after the end of oestrus; surgery at this time is unlikely
to induce a pseudopregnancy
for medical termination of pregnancy it is important to recognize that the
gestation
methods which produce luteolysis may therefore be used to terminate
pregnancy
be directed against this hormones to cause demise of the corpora lutea and the
termination of pregnancy
Progesterone antagonists
 aglepristone displaces progesterone from its receptor but does not change pro-
gesterone concentrations in the blood; the progesterone has no biological action
and therefore the pregnancy will be terminated
 aglepristone is administered in two doses 24 hours apart; in giant breeds a high
volume of drug needs to be injected and this has to be distributed into several
injection sites
the regime can be implemented at any time:
[a]  
 before day 21 there are no obvious clinical outcomes other than the bitch
 does not stay pregnant
[b]
between day 21 and day 35 there is commonly a haemorrhagic discharge
but with few other signs
[c]
between day 35 and day 45 there is normally a haemorrhagic discharge
and some fetal components may be expelled, the bitch has uterine contrac-
tions and signs similar to parturition
d]
J sdar aos are ara pe asusa aa e si ana st p re
necessary for elimination of fetal material
Hormonal Contraception
277
later treatments are generally perceived to be less acceptable by the owner and
the possibility of failure of expulsion (because this drug regime does not cause
active uterine contractions) makes early treatment most appropriate
Combination of prolactin inhibitor and prostaglandin
whilst it is true that both prolactin inhibitors and prostaglandins may be used
prostaglandins) dose can be reduced which reduces adverse effects
the combination of the dopamine agonist cabergoline given daily for 10 days
and the synthetic prostaglandin cloprostenol given every other day, will induce
 pregnancy termination from day 28 after ovulation onwards
earlier treatment is not efficacious as cabergoline inhibits prolactin release (and
there is insufficient prolactin until that time) and prostaglandins are more effec-
tive in causing luteolysis after day 25
low doses of cabergoline are used (5 μg/kg/day)
low doses of cloprostenol are used (2-5 μg/kg); these are much lower than early
publications using prostaglandin describe, and as a result adverse effects such
as salivation, vomiting, pyrexia, hyperpnoea, ataxia and diarrhoea are either
soo iou op ro P
prostaglandin is also useful because it causes uterine contraction and helps to
dislodge the pregnancy
when bitches are treated for approximately 10 days, 100% will resorb, and
there are generally no adverse effects
Corticosteroids
in  many  species  glucocorticoid  administration during  pregnancy  induces
abortion
 in the bitch repeated administration and high doses of dexamethasone are
required
the method has found limited use in clinical practice
 NB: After any attempt to terminate pregnancy the bitch should be examined with
ultrasound to confirm complete resorption or expulsion.
25.8 HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION IN DOGS
 there is less use of hormonal contraception in males, especially since methods
used to suppress testosterone production (and therefore to control male behav-
iour) also have an effect upon spermatogenesis; for animals required for breed-
ing in the future these methods are therefore often avoided
male behaviour and contraception can be controlled by the administration of
 progestogens, androgens and combinations of these; in the author's laboratory
we have shown these to be highly efficacious [2] (Figure 25.1)

azoospermia in most treated dogs within 2 weeks.
 contraception can also be achieved by administration of long-acting implants
containing a GnRH agonist; this causes down-regulation of receptors and a
reduction in secretion of LH and FSH and therefore decreased testicular ster-
oidogenesis and spermatogenesis
further details are given in Chapter 27

Surgical Neutering
26.1
OVARIOHYSTERECTOMY OF THE BITCH
 ovariohysterectomy (neutering) means removal of the uterus and both ovaries;
this is the standard practice in many countries although it is gradually being
replaced by ovariectomy (removal of the ovaries only)
 in bitches not intended for breeding this operation should be considered seri-
ously because, in most cases, any disadvantages are far outweighed by the
advantages; it also helps to reduce the problem of unwanted pups
there is no evidence that surgical neutering has a beneficial effect on
behaviour
 there is a risk of dominance aggression in bitches spayed at a young age when
 there are already signs of aggression before the surgery
 removal of the ovaries causes a slight increase in appetite in some bitches
Indications
removal of the ovaries prevents problems associated with oestrus including:
(a ]   vulval discharge, repeated urination and unwanted attention of male dogs
whilst exercising the bitch
[b]   
 nuisance and road traffic accidents caused by the bitch roaming and male
dogs being attracted to the house
prevents unplanned pregnancies
prevents pyometra (see 16.5)
should prevent false pregnancy (see 3.7 and 19.8)
reduces the incidence of mammary neoplasia (bitches which are neutered before
the first oestrus very rarely develop mammary neoplasms)
Timing
spaying bitches before puberty is surgically easiest and should reduce the likeli-
hood of operative complications

 surgery at this time will reduce the incidence of subsequent mammary neoplasia
and there is no risk of pregnancy
 however, it is proposed that pre-pubertal surgery may increase the incidence of
obesity, incontinence and juvenile’ vulva (see 16.1), although this has not been
proven
 most authorities now recommend pre-pubertal neutering but there are some
clinical situations when this may not be suggested:
[a]
 bitches that have a current pre-pubertal vaginitis; as this may not resolve
until after the first oestrus
[b]
bitches that have current signs of urinary incontinence; as this may worsen
with pre-pubertal neutering
[c)
 bitches with underdeveloped external genitalia; as these may not develop
normally after neutering
d]
bitches that have signs of dominance aggression; as this may worsen fol-
lowing pre-pubertal neutering
bitches from breeds where coat colour changes may occur after pre-
[e]
 pubertal neutering (several breeds with red-coloured hair); as this may be
exacerbated by pre-pubertal neutering
Timing of surgery after the first oestrus
there are two clear windows at which time neutering is appropriate after
oestrus
Approximately 20days after oestrus
this is a good time as the risk of inducing a pseudopregnancy is small (as pro-
lactin concentrations are not yet elevated)
the blood supply to the uterus and ovaries is good at this time and haemostasis
may be a problem
this may be a good time to spay a bitch which is not wanted for breeding and
has been mated inadvertently
From 3 months after oestrus to just before the next pro-oestrus
 by this time the ovaries (corpora lutea) have become inactive and blood supply
is minimal
Otherpointsrelating to the time of surgery
after parturition; a bitch can be spayed as soon as the puppies are completely
weaned (6-8 weeks) and lactation has finished
 it is not sensible to perform the surgery between 5 weeks and 2.5 months after
oestrus since at this time progesterone concentrations are maintained by prol-
actin so that removal of the ovaries results in a reduction of progesterone and
Surgical Neutering

a dramatic increase in prolactin and therefore the induction of iatrogenic
pseudopregnancy
 do not operate if a bitch is in false pregnancy as signs may continue
post-surgically
 cases of pyometra must be operated on when the patient's chances of survival
are greatest despite the fact that surgery at this time may induce a
pseudopregnancy
Technique
·the detailed technique is available in other standard textbooks
Complications of ovariohysterectomy
 surgical and immediately post-surgery complications are described in other
standard textbooks
Haemorrbagic discharge per vaginam
a bloody vulval discharge within 7 days of surgery is usually due to a transfix-
ing ligature being placed through the vaginal lumen;
rarely it may be associated development of a uterine granuloma; infection at
this site can be a serious complication
 mild cases can be treated symptomatically, although if haemorrhage is persist-
 ent and severe it will be necessary to re-operate and remove the vaginal stump
Post-renal granuloma with a discbarging sinus in the flank
due to using non-absorbable ligature material which was contaminated with
bacteria
ensure that the sinus originates from the site of the ovarian pedicle by surgical
dissection or contrast radiography: these sinuses may take up to a year to form
 and so sometimes are not recognized as a complication of the surgery
remove the abscess by blunt and blind dissection via a mid line laparotomy;
this can be very difficult
Signs of oestrus after spay (due to leaving an ovary in situ)
 many cases present because the female is attracting males
 a red-coloured discharge will only be present if the uterus or a portion of
 a           
diapedesis)
 it is always best ensure that the bitch is really in oestrus by taking a vaginal
smear and looking for anuclear epithelial cells; some bitches with vaginitis are
thought to be in oestrus (see 5.5)
282
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
if there is confusion about whether a remnant ovary is present a blood sample
for progesterone can be taken 4 weeks after oestrus; high progesterone will
only have originated from an ovary
 surgery performed at this time will give the greatest chance of locating the
ovary which is at its largest size at approximately 4 weeks post oestrus
if the bitch is presented months after the signs of oestrus have been observed
  i  e    q   o 
a GnRH stimulation test
 the ovary should be located within the fat pad caudal to the kidney
Post-spay false pregnancy
most commonly this occurs because of inappropriate timing of ovariohys-
terectomy; removal of the ovaries when corpora lutea are present results
 in a decline in progesterone concentrations and an increase in prolactin
concentrations
these cases generally develop clinical signs within 1-2 weeks of the surgery
the removal of the ovaries (containing corpora lutea) results in a fall of pro-
gesterone and a rise in prolactin

an ovarian remnant is not present
  q

treatment of iatrogenic pseudopregnancy requires prolactin inhibitors and
sometimes an extended treatment period of 3 weeks is required to ensure a
cure
Obesity
 this is the most common post-spay problem
 some breeds are likely to put on weight anyway after middle age, e.g. Labrador
retrievers
 it is easier to prevent a dog from gaining weight than it is to reduce its weight
in order to prevent weight gain:
[a]
 advise the owner of this likelihood as often as possible
[b]
 advise regular weighing of the bitch after spaying
[c]
 consider the early use of “obesity diets' if reduction of energy intake and
increased exercise do not prevent weight gain
Change of coat texture
· for example, Irish setters, Samoyeds, etc. These changes are unavoidable
Urinary incontinence (see 19.10)
 most commonly there is an overflow incontinence seen when the bitch is
recumbent
Surgical Neutering
283
signs may develop even within a few weeks of the surgery, although in other
cases signs may take months or years to appear
the incontinence appears to be associated with:
[a】
atrophy of the urethral muscles and epithelium which results in an insuf-
ficient sphincter mechanism and allows the uncontrolled escape of urine
[b]
rarely an acquired ectopic ureter occurs due to the ureter being inadvert-
ently included in the uterine ligature and forming a fistula into the vagina;
the possibility of this occurring seems very unlikely and cases have been
recorded where laparotomy with no involvement of the urogenital tract
a oidoioa e o ap a o pan iadde s
Pyometra
 occasionally, if the uterine body is not removed a pyometra can develop, i.e. a
'stump pyometra'
 a true pyometra condition can only occur if the remnant uterus is exposed to
 ovarian hormones (either oestrogen or progesterone or both); this means with
an ovarian remnant needs also to be present or the bitch needs to be given
exogenous hormones before the condition can develop (many clinical cases are
actually uterine granulomas and not a true pyometra)
exogenous oestrogen may be given to spayed bitch to control signs of urinary
incontinence
initially the condition may not be recognized because the owner and veterinary
surgeon do not expect the bitch to have a uterus as she has been 'spayed
·the treatment is as for pyometra
26.2 OVARIECTOMY OF THE BITCH
in many European countries ovariectomy rather than ovariohysterectomy has
been performed for many years
there is a growing trend for pre-pubertal ovariectomy to be performed by
laparoscopy
after removal of the ovaries the uterus rapidly atrophies
 uterine disease is uncommon unless the bitch is given exogenous reproductive
steroids, e.g. progestogens for the control of skin disease, or oestrogens for the
control of vaginitis
 the laparotomy surgical technique is more simple and can be performed quickly
compared with that required for an ovariohysterectomy
the laparoscopic technique requires special training but when perfected can be
performed quickly and safely; during the surgery the ovary is fixed to the lateral
abdominal wall to help vessel ligation. Recovery from surgery is remarkably

26.3 ORCHIDECTOMY (CASTRATION) OF THE DOG
orchidectomy (orchiectomy, castration, neutering, gelding) means removal of
the testes and the epididymides
neutered male dogs make better pets because they are less likely to roam or be
restless; they are not distracted by bitches in oestrus and they are unable to
produce puppies
Indications
castration reduces the incidence of many sex-linked antisocial habits, e.g. copu-
latory behaviour, roaming, urine marking and aggression to other male dogs
NB: Castration rarely modifes aggression towards people which is often moti-
vated by fear.
castration is required in cases of testicular or scrotal trauma or pathology
[a]
testicular tumours (see 17.3)
[b)
testicular torsion (see 17.3)
17.3)
castration may be necessary to control disease stimulated by testosterone
[a]
prostatic disease (see 17.7)
[b]
peri-anal adenoma
[c]
 perineal hernia
Timing
Elective castration
 this may be carried out from 5 months of age; early castration may increase
the likelihood of obesity and delay closure of growth plates resulting in animals
having a long-legged stature
Castration for antisocial behaviour
this may be carried out at any time; it is most effective for the prevention of
roaming
older dogs are more likely to have “learned’ behavioural patterns, i.e. they are
 no longer testosterone dependent and these show limited response to surgery

285
Cryptorcbid and ectopic testes
testes that are held at a higher temperature than is present within the scrotum
are more likely to become neoplastic than scrotal testes
they should be removed before the dog is about 3 years old
NB: Unilateral cryptorchid dogs are fertile and potent; bilateral cryptorchids are
sterile and potent (see 17.3).

this is a common sequel because of the ^dead’ space left within the scrotal pouch
swelling is usually caused by blood and/or inflammatory fluid and may give
the impression that the testes have not been removed
 some cases are severe and described as scrotal haematoma
 scrotal swelling can be minimized by strict haemostasis, whilst some veterinary
surgeons ablate the scrotum as part of the procedure in adult dogs of large
breeds
these cases are best managed with antibiotics to prevent infection, use of an
 Elizabethan collar to prevent trauma to incision and scrotum, and assurance
of the owner that the swelling is not due to growth of new testicles!

26.4 VASECT0MY
 removal of a section of the vas deferens is commonly performed to create steril-
 ity but without an impact upon reproductive behaviour in several animal
species including man
 there are no reasons for vasectomy to be undertaken in dogs since it has none
of the additional benefits of castration in terms of protection of reproductive
tract disease and controlling male-stimulated behaviour
 vasectomy is not normally performed in dogs

PROGESTOGENS [1]
 progesterone is produced by the corpora lutea of the bitch, and is not naturally
produced by the dog
closure of the cervix and stimulates endometrial growth and secretion
 progesterone is responsible for mammary gland development during the luteal
phase
 progesterone has a feedback effect upon the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
progestogens are compounds with progesterone-like activity, and therefore they
each exhibit the actions above:
(a]  it is, however, their negative feedback effect upon the hypothalamus and
pituitary gland that is the principal reason why they are so widely used
for the control of reproduction
[b]
 progestogens appear to exert many of their actions by preventing a rise
in gonadotrophin secretion
[c]
progestogens have a negative feedback effect upon the release of prolactin,
and can reduce, to some extent, circulating concentrations of testosterone
and oestrogen by their actions upon gonadotrophin secretion
high doses of progesterone and progestogens are centrally sedative in action
in male dogs progestogens have an additional and direct effect upon the pros-
tate gland causing a reduction in size, mediated probably by blocking the action
of androgens (they are therefore described as being anti-androgenic in addition
to their effects in reducing testosterone concentrations)
 progesterone and progestogens are commercially available in a variety of for-
mulations including oral therapy that must be given daily, and oily suspensions
and implants that provide a slow release over several weeks or months
Adverse effectsofprogestogens
General
 many transient effects may follow the administration of progestogens
including:

 temperament changes
these effects vary in their incidence between the different progestogens, although
in general they are less frequent with the more recently developed ones
the subcutaneous administration of some progestogens (especially the depot
preparations) may produce hair discoloration and local alopecia at the site of
injection
 it is therefore recommended that administration should be performed in an
inconspicuous site, although this is usually impractical
 all progestogens may potentially induce the production of growth hormone.
Chronic over-secretion of growth hormone may result in the clinical signs of
 acromegaly and peripheral insulin antagonism which may result in diabetes
mellitus
 progestogen therapy may also produce adrenocortical suppression
Specific adverse effects inthe bitch
 progestogens may result in the development of cystic endometrial hyperplasia
and pyometra (see 16.5)

administered and the duration of treatment
 this action appears to be potentiated by oestrogen, and for this reason certain
depot progestogens (medroxyprogesterone acetate) are not licensed for use
when oestrogen concentrations are elevated (they are therefore not used for the
suppression of oestrus)
 other depot progestogens (proligestone and delmadinone acetate) have been
shown to be safe when administered at practically any stage of the oestrous
cycle
 there are no preparations recommended for use at the first oestrous period or
 in pre-pubertal bitches
 benign mammary nodules can be induced by progestogen therapy, and it has
 been suggested that progestogens may induce mammary neoplasia, although
this does not appear to be the case with proligestone
 progestogen therapy during pregnancy may delay or prevent parturition, and
may produce masculinized female and cryptorchid male fetuses
Specific adverse effects in the dog
 high doses of progestogens cause marked changes in semen quality, the majority
of which are related to a direct effect upon the epididymides

however, it is surprising that lower doses administered for short periods of time
produce no measurable effect on semen quality or fertility
Clinical use of progestogens in bitches
Control of oestrus (see Chapter 25)
 administration of progestogens to bitches in anoestrus prevents gonadotrophin
secretion increasing above basal values, and therefore prevents a return to
cyclical activity
 if given when there is follicular activity (pro-oestrus or early oestrus), ovulation
is inhibited and the bitch returns relatively quickly to anoestrus
 when progestogens are given daily or as a depot preparation they mimic a luteal
phase, which is followed by a state of anoestrus
progestogens are generally administered in one of four regimes to control
oestrus in the bitch:
Subcutaneous administration of depot preparations during anoestrus
 depot progestogens (medroxyprogesterone acetate, delmadinone acetate, pro-
ligestone) administered subcutaneously during anoestrus will prevent a subse-
quent oestrus and regular repeated dosing (at 4-6-month intervals) can be used
 to prevent oestrus on a long-term basis 
medroxyprogesterone acetate and proligestone are licensed for this purpose
delmadinone acetate is unlicensed and has to be administered more frequently
because of its shorter duration of action
 z  a r  d n a aq  1
when therapy is ceased most females cycle normally
progestogens may induce cystic endometrial hyperplasia and therefore reduce
fertility
Oral administration of progestogens during anoestrus
· low doses of orally active progestogens (megestrol acetate, medroxyprogester-
one acetate, altrenogest, norethisterone acetate) can be used to prevent oestrus
for as long as administration is continued
megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate are licensed for this purpose
should the animal enter pro-oestrus during the first few days of treatment, the
dosage can be increased
a period of anoestrus usually follows therapy, so oestrus does not return imme-
diately after cessation of treatment
Oral administration of progestogens during pro-oestrus
 high doses of orally active progestogens (megestrol acetate, medroxyprogester-
one acetate, altrenogest, norethisterone acetate) may be given during pro-
oestrus to suppress the signs of oestrus
290
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate are licensed for this purpose
treatment during late pro-oestrus may not prevent ovulation in the bitch,
although conception is unlikely to occur
treatment too early may lead to a return to oestrus soon after dosing
a reducing dose regime administered from the first signs of pro-oestrus and
continued for up to 16 days is usually efficacious
this is usually followed by a variable period of anoestrus; oestrus returns
 between 4 and 6 months after the end of medication
Subcutaneous administration of depot preparations during pro-oestrus
bitches in early pro-oestrus may be used to suppress the signs of that oestrus
older-generation progestogens  (medroxyprogesterone acetate)  which  have
potent effects upon the uterus are not recommended
signs of pro-oestrus/oestrus disappear within approximately 5 days
following the depot progestogen, there is a variable anoestrus, and oestrus
returns approximately 6 months later
NB: Other agents that may be used for the control of oestrus cyclicity include
long-term administration of androgens commencing in anoestrus.

 prolactin may increase again if progestogen therapy is rapidly withdrawn
 progestogens may be administered either orally daily (for example, megestrol
acetate) or by depot injection (for example, proligestone or delmadinone
acetate)
 frst-generation progestogens such as medroxyprogesterone acetate are not
recommended because they have marked effects upon the uterus and might
 potentiate the development of a pyometra
oral therapy is often associated with relapse of the clinical signs, if therapy is
terminated too quickly; this can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the
dose over a period of approximately 7 or 10 days
care must be taken to ensure that the bitch is not pregnant, especially if depot
progestogens are to be used because these can delay or prevent parturition
it is likely that the return to oestrus will be delayed following the administra-
tion of progestogens
NB: It is imperative that bitches are confirmed to be pseudopregnant rather than
being pregnant (owners may be unaware) since treatment of pregnant bitches can

291
delay or prevent parturition resulting in significant illness in bitches [2]. Other
options for the treatment of pseudopregnancy include the administration of andro-
gens, oestrogens, or combinations of these, or the use of prolactin antagonists such
as cabergoline.

tion resulting in fetal death
Clinical use of progestogens in dogs
Antisocial bebaviour and other bebavioural problems
 aggression, roaming, territory marking, copulatory activity, destruction and
excitability exhibited by both entire and castrated dogs may be controlled in
some cases by progestogens
their actions relate both to their anti-androgenic effect and their central sedative
action
depot progestogen therapy may need to be repeated every month for the
shorter-acting preparations (delmadinone acetate) and up to every 6 months for
the longer-acting preparations (medroxyprogesterone acetate and proligestone)
oral therapy has also been shown to be effective and has the advantage that
the dose may be adjusted to the effect
 NB: Behaviour modification training is an essential adjunct to progestogen therapy,
and entire dogs should be considered for castration.
Benign prostatic byperplasia (see 17.7)
 progestogens are both anti-androgenic and have a direct effect upon the pros-
tate gland
· these actions are responsible for the rapid reduction in the clinical signs associ-
ated with regression of the prostate gland
remission of signs within 14 days, although a second treatment may be neces-
sary in some individuals
 delmadinone acetate is commonly used because of its short period of action
and its relative sparing effects upon sperm production
 other depot or orally active progestogens (osaterone acette) are equally effica-
cious and high doses or long treatment periods are necessary to interfere with
fertility; the author has shown that it is therefore possible to titrate the clinical

Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
benefit of control of prostatic disease without adversely affecting fertility in
stud dogs [3]
 in many cases only 1 week of administration is required to produce several
months of clinical benefit (e.g. osaterone)
 as well as the negative feedback effects, progestogens also prevent binding of
androgens to prostatic receptors which increases their efficacy
in dogs not required for breeding, castration is the treatment of choice
NB: Other agents that may be used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyper
plasia include oestrogens and anti-androgens such as flutamide and finasteride.
Prostatitis
 dogs with bacterial prostatitis require appropriate antibiotic treatment, however
control of clinical signs can be speeded by the concomitant administration of
progestogens
Prostatic neoplasia (see 17.7)

lowing the administration of progestogens
the effect is usually only short-term, and progestogens offer little relief in meta-
static disease
NB: Other agents that may be used include oestrogens, anti-androgens such as
flutamide and finasteride, and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) ana-
logues such as buserelin.
Circumanal adenomata
 the anti-androgenic effect of progestogens given as a depot or oral preparation
is useful for causing temporary reduction in the size of these benign tumours
tumours with central necrosis may not respond well
 in dogs not required for breeding, castration is the treatment of choice
NB: Other agents that may be used include oestrogens.
Contraception
 long-term administration of high doses of progestogens may be useful to cause
spermatozoal abnormalities and a possible suppression of spermatogenesis [3]
the concurrent administration of depot androgens appears to be more effica-
cious and allows the progestogen dose to be reduced; indeed progestogens are
unlikely to be efficacious if used alone
 castration is the method of choice in dogs that are not required for breeding
NB: Other agents that may be used include GnRH agonists

OESTROGENS [1]
oestrogen is produced by ovarian follicles of the bitch, and the Leydig cells of
the dog
 e o r e  ssr a soo o
sexual characteristics
 oestrogens are necessary for normal secretion and functioning of the uterine
tubes, and changes in oestrogen concentration regulate the gonadotrophin
surge which stimulates ovulation
 oestrogen is involved in the initiation of parturition
in the male, oestrogens are involved in the feedback control of Leydig cell
function
high  doses
s of exogenous oestrogen cause a negative feedback at the
hypothalamic-pituitary axis and subsequent suppression of gonadotrophin
secretion
 low doses of oestrogen enhance the release of FSH
Adverse effects of oestrogens
General
oestrogens have been shown to produce a dose-related bone marrow
suppression
this may result in a severe and possibly fatal anaemia and thrombocytopenia
 prolonged oestrogen therapy may produce a non-pruritic bilaterally symmetri-
cal alopecia and skin hyperpigmentation
Specificadwerse effectsin the bitch
 oestrogens potentiate the stimulatory effect of progesterone on the uterus, cause
cervical relaxation and allow vaginal bacteria to enter the uterus
 endometrial hyperplasia and pyometra
large doses of oestrogen may stimulate signs of oestrus in both entire and
ovariohysterectomized bitches
oestrogens may cause cervical relaxation and abortion in the pregnant bitch
ing fetuses
Specific adverse effects in the dog
 Oestrogens may result in abnormalities of semen quality and a resultant reduc-
tion in fertility
 prolonged therapy may cause reversible prostatic metaplasia (see 17.7)
294
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Clinical use of oestrogens in the bitch
Unwanted mating (see 25.7)
tered soon after mating
oestrogens may also produce a short luteal phase by interfering with luteinizing
hormone (LH) support of the corpora lutea
 diethylstilboestrol, oestradiol cypionate and mestranol have been widely used
to treat unwanted matings
only oestradiol benzoate is licensed for the treatment of unwanted mating in
the UK
oestradiol benzoate may be administered at a lower dose 3 and 5 (and possibly
also 7) days after mating
NB: Other agents that may be used include aglepristone, the progesterone receptor
antagonist. It is also possible to perform surgical neutering or to wait for a diag-
nosis of pregnancy at 28 days and then to terminate a pregnancy if present with
aglepristone or a combination of prolactin inhibitor with prostaglandin.
Pseudopregnancy (see 3.7 and 19.8)
oestrogens may be used to produce an inhibition of prolactin secretion in
bitches with pseudopregnancy
a preparation of ethinyl oestradiol combined with methyltestosterone was
 previously available and produced a good clinical response, although the dose
suggested seems arbitrary
 recurrence of the clinical signs may follow abrupt termination of treatment
NB: Other treatment options include the administration of progestogens, andro-
 gens or specific prolactin antagonists such as cabergoline.
Juvenile vaginitis (see 16.3)
 the condition usually regresses after the first oestrus
if the clinical signs are severe some control may be effected using low doses of
oral oestrogens daily for 5 days
·an alternative therapy is the topical application of oestrogen-containing creams
Oestrus induction (see 24.4)
 low doses of oestrogen enable follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate
the formation of LH receptors on granulosa cells
 diethylstilboestrol may be used orally daily for up to 2 days after the onset of
pro-oestrus
ovulation is ensured by the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin
(hCG)
Pharmacological Control of Reproduction
295
NB: Other treatment regimes include the administration the prolactin inhibitor
cabergoline or equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) followed by human chori-
onic gonadotrophin.
Urinary incontinence
 in ovariohysterectomized bitches incontinence may relate to changes in the
 thickness of the urethral mucosa in the absence of oestrogen 
 some cases respond to oestrogen therapy, whilst in others the response is short
lived or absent
NB: Other agents that may be used include the drugs that act directly upon the
urethral muscle such as phenylpropanolamine and depot GnRH agonists.
Clinical use of oestrogens in the dog
Antisocial bebaviour and other bebavioural problems
 oestrogens may be useful in dogs which show antisocial behaviour
 the potential adverse effects result in progestogens being more commonly used
Benign prostatic byperplasia (see 17.7)
 repeated administration of oestrogens will result in a reduction in prostatic size
and the amelioration of the clinical signs
the treatment of choice is probably low-dose progestogens which have a
minimal effect on fertility, or castration in the animal that is not required for
breeding
prolonged oestrogen therapy may result in prostatic metaplasia and a resultant
increase in the size of the prostate gland
NB: Other treatment options include the use of progestogens and GnRH
agonists.
Prostatic neoplasia (see 17.7)
· clinical signs of prostatic neoplasia may be controlled in the short term by the
administration of oestrogens
 progestogens may also be useful in the short term, whilst in man anti-androgens
and GnRH analogues are widely used
Circumanal adenomata
·the anti-androgenic effect of oestrogens may be useful to cause a decrease in
the size of these tumours
NB: Other options are the administration of progestogens, although the treatment
of choice is castration in dogs that are not required for breeding.

27.3 ANDROGENS [3]
 the naturally occurring androgens, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, are
 produced by the interstitial cells of the testes
 in the male, androgens mediate the development and maintenance of primary
 and secondary sexual characteristics and normal sexual behaviour and potency
androgens play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of
spermatogenesis
 androgens are generally not present in significant concentrations in the non-
pregnant female
androgens have a negative feedback effect upon the hypothalamic-pituitary
axis, and influence, among other things, the release of the gonadotrophins and
prolactin
 synthetic androgens have a duration of activity related to the nature of the ester
Adverse effects of androgens
General
 androgen therapy may produce virilizing effects such as aggression, and their
use may be contra-indicated in dogs with existing behavioural problems
in pre-pubertal animals premature epiphyseal growth plate closure may occur
androgens are contra-indicated in nephrotic conditions because the anabolic
component causes both sodium and water retention
Specific adwerse effects in the bitch
prolonged androgen administration may result in clitoral hypertrophy, and very
rarely the development of an os clitoris
 repeated or prolonged therapy may result in a persistent vaginitis
severe urogenital abnormalities may develop in female fetuses if androgens are
administered to bitches during pregnancy (see Chapter 19)
Specific adverse effects in the dog
 high doses of androgen produce severe changes in spermatozoal morphology
and fertility
Clinical use of androgens in the bitch
Control of oestrus (see Chapter 25)
androgens may be administered to bitches in anoestrus to prevent a return to
cyclical activity
androgens are not useful for inhibiting oestrus in females with follicular activity
(pro-oestrus or early oestrus)
Pharmacological Control of Reproduction
297
 administration must commence in late anoestrus, at least 30 days before the
onset of pro-oestrus
they do not mimic the luteal phase, and there is no subsequent anoestrus;
therefore cyclical activity returns rapidly after the cessation of treatment
 in the UK the most common regime is the administration of depot androgens
during anoestrus either as a prolonged-release implant, or depot injection of
mixed testosterone esters; it is not uncommon for depot therapy to be sup-
 plemented by daily oral therapy
in other countries an orally active synthetic androgen, mibolerone, is
available
NB: Other agents that may be used to control oestrus include the progestogens.
Pseudopregnancy (see 3.7 and 19.8)
 relatively high doses of androgens may be used to produce an inhibition of
prolactin secretion
 this results in a rapid resolution of the clinical signs
aaq sosao r sisord raa n a a q  sos
they do not have any adverse effects on the uterus
oral methyltestosterone or parenteral testosterone esters are efficacious;
however the orally active methyltestosterone combined with ethinyl oestradiol
was previously available which produced a good clinical response
NB: Other treatment options for pseudopregnancy include the administration
of progestogens, oestrogens alone, or specific prolactin inhibitors such as
cabergoline.
Clinical use of androgens in the dog
Poor libido (see 20.2)
 there is no evidence in the dog that poor libido is caused by low circulating
androgen concentrations
androgens should not be used in these cases because they produce significant
changes in spermatozoal morphology and fertility [3]
NB: Other agents that may be useful in dogs with poor libido include hCG, which
produces an increase in endogenous testosterone concentration.
Poor semen quality (see 17.3 and 20.3)
 androgen supplementation is commonly used in these cases, and this may

the negative feedback mechanism
298
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 in the author's laboratory we demonstrated a substantial effect of androgens
on semen quality which resulted in azoospermia within a few weeks [3]
an analogue of dihydrotestosterone, mesterolone, is available in the UK for
human use and is unusual in that it is not aromatized to oestradiol and does
not significantly suppress the release of pituitary gonadotrophins; in the author's
clinic the drug was shown to have a positive effect on semen quality of some
cases [4]
Contraception
 long-term administration of high doses of androgens may be useful for reducing
semen quality
the concurrent administration of progestogens appears to be more effica-
cious [3]
Cryptorcbidism (see 17.3)
 medical therapy with androgens has not been shown to be efficacious and is
unethical
27.4 GONADOTROPHINS
the gonadotrophins FSH and LH are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland
 in the bitch, FSH stimulates initial follicular development and its surge release
is associated with the process of ovulation
 in the bitch, LH also stimulates follicular growth, is the trigger for ovulation
and is a principal luteotrophic agent
 in the dog FSH stimulates spermatogenesis indirectly by an action upon the
Sertoli cells, and LH stimulates the Leydig cells to produce testosterone
 neither FSH or LH are available for use in the dog; however
[a]
 equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) is mainly FSH-like in activity
[b]
human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is primarily LH-like in effect
Adverse effects of gonadotrophins
General
there is a risk of inducing anaphylactoid reactions and antibody formation
following the injection of these protein preparations
Specific adwerse effects in the bitch
 hCG if given to oestrous bitches may cause luteinization of follicles and inter-
fere with ovulation
hyperstimulation of the ovary by the administration of high doses of eCG on
the use of repeated therapy may result in non-ovulating follicles and persistent
oestrus behaviour
Pharmacological Control of Reproduction
299
 a persistent elevation in plasma oestrogen concentration may lead to adverse
effects typical of oestrogen toxicity
Specific adverse effects in the dog
none
Clinical use of gonadotrophins in the bitch
Induction of oestrus (see 24.4)
repeated doses of eCG given to anoestrous bitches stimulate follicular growth
and the production of oestrogen 
 ovulation may occur spontaneously, following an endogenous surge of LH, or
may be induced using hCG
 care must be observed when using eCG and hCG combinations because endog-
enous hyperoestrogenism may occur and result in inhibition of implantation,
bone marrow suppression and death
low doses of gonadotrophins are suggested to produce more physiological
plasma oestrogen profiles
 a relatively low plasma progesterone concentration or short luteal phase fol-
lowing gonadotrophin-induced oestrus is common
in the author's clinic we demonstrated the value of gonadotrophin regimes for
 oestrus induction of bitches [5]
NB: Other agents that may be useful for the induction of oestrus include low-dose
oestrogens, or prolactin inhibitors such as cabergoline.
Delayed puberty (see 19.1)
 therapy to induce oestrus may be attempted using an eCG/hCG regime
Hastening of owulation (see 19.4)
 bitches that repeatedly fail to conceive are sometimes given hCG at the time
of mating on the assumption that ovulation has not occurred or that early
development of the corpora lutea is inadequate; there is no evidence that this
 is the case, and such “blind’ therapy cannot be recommended
 some bitches may have prolonged pro-oestrus or oestrus and the administration
of hCG may possibly hasten ovulation; hCG is administered when more than
 90% of vaginal epithelial cells are anuclear, or when a slight rise in plasma
progesterone concentration has been detected
premature administration of hCG may result in follicular luteinization and
failure of ovulation
NB: GnRH may be used in a similar manner to hasten ovulation
300
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Identification of owarian tissue
it may be difficult to determine clinically whether a bitch has been
ovariohysterectomized
the administration of hCG to bitches with ovaries results in an increase in
plasma oestrogen concentration
this method may therefore be clinically useful for detecting the presence of
ovaries
NB: The administration of GnRH may also be clinically useful for the identifica-
tion of spayed bitches.
Clinical use of gonadotrophins in the dog
Diagnosis of testicular tissue (see 17.3)
  as rsan jo ad a ssn s o  so a 
confirmed by performing an hCG stimulation test (see 10.15)
plasma testosterone concentration is measured before and 60 minutes after the
intravenous administration of hCG; a significant rise in testosterone concentra-
tion is diagnostic of testicular tissue
Cryptorcbidism (see 17.3)
testicular  descent
twill not occur  following the administration of
gonadotrophins
 the condition is likely to be inherited and medical treatment is unethical
Hypogonadism (see 20.1)
treatment with gonadotrophins is not successful
Poor libido (see 20.2)
a transient increase in libido may follow the administration of hCG to male
dogs
 this effect is the result of increased endogenous testosterone concentrations
27.5
5 GONADOTROPHIN-RELEASING HORMONE (GnRH)
AGONISTS
GnRH controls gonadotrophin synthesis via a neuroendocrine mechanism
several synthetic GnRH agonists are available, the one licensed most widely
for use in dogs is deslorelin which is described as a 'super-agonist'
[a] 
 GnRH agonists cause an increase in the production of FSH and LH
[b]
however, their repeated or depot administration results in a down-
regulation of the receptors thus preventing the release of FSH and LH (in
essence then working like an antagonist)
Pharmacological Control of Reproduction
301
GnRH antagonists produce a reduction in circulating gonadotrophins within
a few hours but no commercially available products are available for use in
animals (several are available as human medicinal products for the treatment
of prostatic neoplasia; they are largely untested in clinical situations in dogs)
Adverse effects of GnRH agonists
General
Specific adwerse effects in the bitch
· repeated or depot administration of GnRH agonists may result in absence of
oestrus (of course this is a reason for use in some circumstances)
 bitches in which oestrus is induced with GnRH agonists may have a short luteal
phase which results in pregnancy loss
Specific adverse effects in the dog
repeated or depot administration of GnRH agonists may cause a reduction

circumstances)
 in a small proportion of dogs there are changes in coat colour and hair loss

omized or ovariohysterectomized because no rise in oestrogen occurs
NB: The GnRH stimulation test requires the pituitary gland to also be functional
An alternative method is to administer hCG and monitor plasma oestrogen con-
centration, which increases in bitches with ovarian tissue
Hastening of owulation (see 19.4)
 single doses of a short acting GnRH agonist may be useful to hasten ovulation
in bitches that are in oestrus
 the use of hCG, however, may be more efficacious, although neither drug has
been adequately evaluated for this purpose
302
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
Induction of oestrus (see 24.4)
 placement of a GnRH agonist implant in anoestus bitches will cause increased
secretion of FSH and LH and result in the onset of pro-oestrus
 if the implant is removed soon after signs of pro-oestrus are seen, the down-
regulation response is avoided and pro-oestrus and oestrus progress
 induced cycles have good fertility but some bitches have a short luteal phase
resulting in pregnancy loss
NB: Other agents that can be used for oestrus induction include prolactin
inhibitors.
Control of oestrus (see 25.5)
placement of a GnRH agonist implant in anoestrus bitches will result in recep-
tor down-regulation and prevent cyclical activity
initial stimulation and signs of pro-oestrus will occur in many bitches shortly
(approximately 4 days) after implantation
 placement of further implants approximately every 5 months will result in
permanent contraception
 bitches return to reasonable fertility after cessation of implantation, although
the time to return to cyclical activity is not predictable
it is feasible to place the implant in the luteal phase and fewer bitches show
signs of pro-oestrus, however it is possible that uterine disease may occur in
these cases (as oestrogen concentration increases when there is already elevated
progesterone) so this regime is not recommended
NB: Other agents that may be used to control oestrus include progestogens and
androgens.
Unwanted mating (see 25.7)
●the down-regulation effects of continuous GnRH administration may be used
in attempt to withdraw gonadotrophin support of the corpus luteum
 suitable clinical trials have, however, not been performed to confirm efficacy
NB: Other agents that may be used to induce resorption or abortion include oes
trogens, prostaglandins, prolactin antagonists and progesterone antagonists.
Urinary incontinence
 bitches (and a small number of dogs) develop an overflow urinary incontinence
after surgical neutering
 these are often described as sphincter mechanism incontinence and are thought
to be due to low concentrations of plasma oestrogen
 however as well as low oestrogen concentrations these animals have high con-
centrations of LH and FSH because there are no gonadal steroids producing a
negative feedback effect
Pharmacological Control of Reproduction
303
 LH, FSH and GnRH receptors are present on urethral smooth muscle and
 s e aond on os q s sie  r o
incontinence in some cases
NB: Other agents with greater efficacy are oestrogen and alpha agonists such as
phenylpropanolamine.
Clinical use of GnRH agonists in the dog
Contraception and controlofmale bebaviour
placement of GnRH agonist implants may be useful for the suppression of LH
and FSH, causing a reduced concentration of testosterone and therefore inhib-
ited libido and infertility
 this effect appears to be a useful method of inducing a reversible contraception
with an effect within 6 weeks of implantation lasting for approximately 6
months (there is considerable variation but most dogs have normal testosterone
concentrations 12 months after implantation)
 use of an implant can be for a temporary control, to establish what the likely
effect on castration on behaviour will be, or where the owner wishes to avoid
surgery
NB: In some dogs behaviour is learned and does not respond well to hormonal
intervention. Other products such as progestogens are useful for control of behav-
iour. Other products such as progestogens, androgens or progestogen-androgen
combinations are suitable for controlling fertility. Castration is the method of
choice in the animal that is not required for breeding.
Prostatic disease (see 17.7)
repeated or depot administration of GnRH agonists may be useful in dogs
which have benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic neoplasia
27.6 GONADOTROPHIN-RELEASING HORMONE (GnRH)
ANTAGONISTS
 few GnRH antagonists have found clinical use in small animal reproduction
because of adverse effects of the formulations and short duration of action
necessitating repeated administration
 recently the experimental use of acyline, which has high receptor affinity and
reasonable duration of action after a single administration, has been to be
useful for termination of pregnancy at approximately day 30
there is no doubt that such a product would find wide clinical use in control-
ling reproduction in males and females if it were to be commercially
available
304
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
27.7  PROSTAGLANDINS
the reproductive prostaglandins are synthesized in the endometrium, and are
both luteolytic and spasmogenic in nature
prostaglandins are involved in the termination of the luteal phase and the
initiation of parturition
 there are no naturally occurring or synthetic prostaglandin analogues licensed
for use in the bitch
 the naturally occurring prostaglandin F2alpha, dinoprost and several synthetic
prostaglandin analogues (especially cloprostenol and luprostiol) have, howe ver,
been widely used
when prostaglandins are required principally for luteolysis, the synthetic pros-
taglandins should be used (e.g. cloprostenol)
when prostaglandins are required principally of uterine spasmogenic actions,
synthetic naturally occurring prostaglandins should be used (e.g. dinoprost)
Adverse effects of prostaglandins
General
 prostaglandin administration may be followed by restlessness, hypersalivation,
vomiting, abdominal pain, pyrexia, tachycardia, ataxia and diarrhoea
high doses may be lethal
these effects are entirely dose-related and with low-dose regimes very few
effects are seen
 adverse effects develop quickly after administration and usually persist for up
to 60 minutes
Specific adverse effects in the bitch
cases of closed-cervix pyometra given prostaglandin may develop uterine
rupture
Specific adverse effects in the dog
 prostaglandins are not used in male dogs
Clinical use of prostaglandins in the bitch
Termination of pregnancy (see 25.7)
 low doses of dinoprost or cloprostenol given daily, or twice daily, for several
days can be used to produce luteal regression
repeated low doses cause lysis of the corpora lutea and induce abortion, espe-
cially when given later than 23 days after ovulation
Pharmacological Control of Reproduction
305
 earlier treatment may not be efficacious because developing corpora lutea are
more resistant to the effects of prostaglandin
 prolactin inhibitor such as cabergoline
Treatment of pyometra (see 16.5)
 prostaglandins may be used to induce uterine emptying (the result of their
spasmogenic activity) and to remove the stimulatory effects of progesterone
(the result of their luteolytic action}
 dinoprost administered at low doses twice daily for 5 days, combined with
appropriate antibiotic and fluid therapy, may be used as a successful
tre atment
 following treatment approximately 20% of bitches return to fertility
the long-term complications include recurrence of pyometra, anoestrus, failure
to conceive and abortion
a better therapeutic option is to use a combination of prostaglandin and a
 prolactin inhibitor such as cabergoline
NB: Other agents that may be used to treat cases of pyometra include progester-
one receptor antagonists such as aglepristone.
Post-partum metritis (see 22.12)
post-partum metritis in the bitch may be treated by using prostaglandins to
induce uterine evacuation
 antimicrobial preparations are mandatory; however, in these cases there is no
 underlying hormonal component (plasma progesterone concentration is low)
and therefore a rapid resolution should be expected
●a regime similar to that used for the treatment of pyometra may be employed
NB: Other treatment options include the administration of oxytocin or ergometrine.
Induction of oestrus (see 24.4)
prostaglandins may be used to induce luteolysis; however the luteal phase is
followed by a variable period of anoestrus
 shortening of the luteal phase does not therefore produce a rapid return to
oestrus
NB: Methods of oestrus induction include the use of prolactin inhibitors and
GnRH agonists.
Clinical use of prostaglandins in the dog
 there are no therapeutic roles for reproductive prostaglandins in the dog
306
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
27.8  PROGESTERONE ANTAGONISTS
specific progesterone receptor antagonists have antiprogestogenic effects
the availability of these agents varies from one country to another
aglepristone is available in many countries and is available as an injectable
solution
 mifepristone (RU486) is available as an orally active product, but sale is limited
in some countries because of potential human misuse
these products have a high affinity for the progesterone receptor and will dis-
place progesterone after administration; there is therefore no biological signal
although there is no initial change in plasma progesterone concentration
Adverse effects of progesterone antagonists
General
 subcutaneous administration of aglepristone is associated with an incidence of
injection site reaction; for large breeds of dog several injections sites are used
to reduce the risk of problems
Specific adwerse effects in the bitch
 administration of progesterone antagonists to pregnant bitches will result in
resorption, abortion or premature parturition, depending upon the time of
administration
Specific adwerse effects in the dog
· there are no therapeutic uses of progesterone antagonists in male dogs
Clinical use of progesterone antagonists in the bitch
Pregnancy termination (see 25.7)
since aglepristone prevents any biological signal from progesterone it can be
used to prevent implantation or to terminate pregnancy at any stage
two doses of aglepristone are given 24 hours apart and this results in elevated
concentrations for several days
· when given to bitches in oestrus the long duration of action will have an effect
upon progesterone when it is released thus blocking progesterone action and
preventing implantation
 when given in early pregnancy resorption will follow
when given in mid pregnancy abortion will follow
when given in late pregnancy fetal death will occur but there may not be expul-
sion and additional treatment with prostaglandin may be necessary
Pharmacological Control of Reproduction
307
Pyometra (see 16.5)
 aglepristone administration on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 16 after presentation appears
to be successful for the treatment of pyometra in the majority of dogs
effects, and emptying of uterine fluid occurred quickly producing resolution of
the clinical signs
 some of the bitches returned to normal fertility after treatment
 improved outcomes can be achieved with the concomitant administration of
prostaglandin
Inductionofparturition
 there are few indications for induction of parturition in bitches; a reliable
technique might be useful for management reasons enabling effective supervi-
sion of whelping, or for management of cases of acute illness in the dam
induction of parturition can be achieved by the administration of two doses of
aglepristone followed 24 hours later by repeated injection of oxytocin; the dose
and frequency of oxytocin is lower the closer the bitch is to spontaneous
parturition
Clinical use of progesterone antagonists in the dog
there are no clinical indications for the use of progesterone antagonists in male
dogs
27.9 PROLACTIN INHIBITORS [6]
prolactin is the primary luteotrophic factor of the pregnant and the non-
pregnant luteal phase
initially corpora lutea appear to be autonomous and do not require other
hormonal support
however after day 20 onwards prolactin concentrations increase and prolactin
becomes the most important support for the corpora lutea; prolactin concentra-
tions are then maintained for the duration of the luteal phase
prolactin inhibitors cause a rapid decrease in prolactin concentration and a
subsequent decline in plasma progesterone concentration (Figure 27.1)
 prolonged prolactin suppression results in a termination of the luteal phase,
and the bitch enters anoestrus
continual administration of prolactin antagonists during anoestrus causes a
return to oestrus sooner than anticipated; the mechanism of this oestrus-
induction action is unknown
bromocriptine and cabergoline are ergot derivatives that inhibit prolactin
cells in the anterior pituitary gland

 cabergoline appears to be a more specific agent that has fewer side-effects
attributable to dopaminergic stimulation of the central nervous system
 cabergoline is widely licensed for use in the dog
Adverse effects of prolactin inhibitors
General
dopaminergic stimulation may result in nausea and vomiting especially with
the first-generation product, bromocriptine
 lethargy and occasional constipation may also be noticed
the adverse effects of bromocriptine can be reduced by using the minimal effec-
tive dose and mixing the drug with food. Specific anti-emetics such as meto-
clopramide may prevent vomiting, but whilst they are clinically useful, their
administration does not make pharmacological sense because they also work
via dopamine receptors
 all adverse effects are uncommon following cabergoline administration

Specificadwerse effects in the bitch
 administration of prolactin antagonists during pregnancy may cause abortion
repeated administration will result in a shortening of anoestrus and a return
to oestrus
Specific adwerse effects in the dog
● there are no clinical applications of prolactin antagonists in male dogs
Clinical use of prolactin inhibitors in the bitch
Pseudopregnancy (see 3.7 and 19.8)
suppression of prolactin causes a rapid resolution of the clinical signs of
pseudopregnancy
 cabergoline is widely available and had good clinical acceptability; occasional
vomiting is seen but this can be reduced by mixing the drug with food, or the
 prior administration of metoclopramide may also be useful as discussed above
 usually clinical signs regress quickly and treatment is only required for 5 or 7
days
NB: Other agents that may be used for the treatment of pseudopregnancy include
 progestogens, androgens, oestrogens and androgen-oestrogen combinations.
Iatrogenic orpersistentpsuedopregnancy
 some iatrogenic cases of pseudopregnancy (induced by neutering during the
mid and late luteal phase) are persistent; these and persistent spontaneous cases
can be treated by prolonged administration of prolactin inhibitors
 treatment may be required for up to 3 weeks
Galactostasis (see 22.21)
excessive milk accumulation within the mammary gland seen especially at the
time of weaning can be managed by a short-duration course of cabergoline
Treatment of pyometra
 repeated administration of prolactin inhibitors will reduce progesterone and
cause opening of the cervix as well as allowing increased uterine contractions
 the concomitant administration of prostaglandin also causes uterine contrac-
tion and lysis of the corpora lutea
 these synergistic actions can be useful in the treatment of pyometra
for closed-cervix pyometra, as long as the prolactin inhibitor is administered
for several days before the prostaglandin, the cervix will open and the risk of
uterine rupture is low compared with regimes using prostaglandin alone
310
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 in the author's clinic we have demonstrated high clinical efficacy using 5.0 μg/
kg cabergoline daily for 10 days with 5.0μg/kg cloprostenol administered on
days 3,6 and 9 [7]
·this regime is now widely used in clinical practice
Termination of pregnancy (see 25.7)
 repeated administration of the prolactin inhibitors produces a reduction in
plasma progesterone concentration and resorption or abortion
efficacy can be increased, and treatment may be given earlier, when prolactin
antagonists and prostaglandins are given simultaneously
 both agents are more effective when given later in pregnancy because the role
of prolactin is more important at this time
common regimes involve the 10-day administration of prolactin inhibitors with
prostaglandin being injected every second day on five occasions
NB: Other agents that may be used to terminate pregnancy include prostaglandins
or progesterone antagonists.
Induction of oestrus (see 24.4)
 apparently normal and fertile oestrous periods may be induced in anoestrous
bitches following continual administration of bromocriptine or cabergoline
the time to the onset of oestrus seems to relate to the stage of anoestrus; bitches
in late anoestrus respond more quickly than those in early anoestrus. Treatment
starting in the luteal phase may also be effective but the treatment period is
longer
 the induced oestrus appears to be physiological, and whilst the mechanism of
action is uncertain it may be the result of inhibition of remnant progesterone
production by the corpora lutea
NB: Other agents that may be used to induce oestrus include low-dose oestrogens
or gonadotrophin combinations.
Clinical use of prolactin inhibitors in the dog
 there are no therapeutic roles for prolactin antagonists in the dog
27.10 OXYTOCIN AND ERGOT PREPARATIONS
shortly before parturition
uterine oxytocin receptors also increase in number close to parturition, and
oxytocin release stimulates contraction of the oestrogen-primed uterus
Pharmacological Control of Reproduction
311
several formulations of oxytocin and posterior pituitary extract are available
commercially, and can be used to stimulate the smooth muscle of the mammary
and genital tract
ergotamines are alkaloid extracts of a rye fungus which are ecbolic agents; they
produce a prolonged spasm of uterine muscle with relaxation only after 1 or
2 hours when the uterus then contracts rhythmically in a similar manner to
that produced by oxytocin
Adverse effects of oxytocin
General
there is a low incidence of skin sloughing or abscess formation recorded by
some manufacturers following the subcutaneous administration of oxytocin
 ergot alkaloids may produce emesis and slight stimulation of the central nervous
system
Specific adwerse effects in the bitch
oxytocin administration to a bitch in late pregnancy may initiate premature
parturition
Specific adverse effects in the dog
 oxytocin and ergot preparations have no clinical indications in the dog
Clinical use of oxytocin in the bitch
Uterine inertia (see 22.1)
 cases of primary uterine inertia or secondary uterine inertia (following correc-
tion of the dystocia) may respond to parenteral oxytocin administration
 oxytocin has a short half-life and therefore repeated administration (every
15-30 minutes) may be necessary to maintain a clinical effect
the use of a continuous low-dose intravenous infusion does not appear to have
been investigated in bitches
 oxytocin is contra-indicated in obstructive dystocia because uterine rupture
may result
 ergot preparations may also be used in cases of inertia; however, they produce
prolonged uterine contractions and are less suitable
Placental retention or fetal retention (see 22.11)
 oxytocin is usually effective at producing uterine contraction and expulsion of
the pup and/or placenta
312
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
are presented late, a hysterotomy may be necessary
 ergot preparations may be used in these cases but are less efficacious because
of the prolonged contractions that they produce
Post-partum baemorrbage (see 22.13)
 persistent uterine haemorrhage may be controlled by oxytocin administration
(vaginal haemorrhage is best controlled by use of a tampon)
ergometrine may be a more useful agent in cases of uterine haemorrhage
because of the initial prolonged uterine contractions
excessive haemorrhage, although very rare, may necessitate a hysterotomy to
identify and correct the cause
Post-partum metritis (see 22.12)
 uterine evacuation may be induced by oxytocin administration in cases of post-
partum metritis however uterine oxytocin receptors decrease after parturition
such that treatment efficacy reduces each day after parturition
 appropriate antibiotic therapy is mandatory
Subinvolution of placental sites (see 22.14)
 most cases regress spontaneously after the bitch has returned to oestrus
oxytocin has little effect once the clinical signs are established, but some anec-
dotal reports suggest that treatment at the time of parturition may prevent the
condition from developing
Agalactia
 lack of milk production is rare in the bitch; drugs that stimulate prolactin
(including metoclopramide) may be useful
an absence of milk letdown is relatively common; it can be treated by the
administration of oxytocin
 oxytocin does not increase milk production
Clinical use of oxytocin in the dog
·there are no clinical applications for oxytocin therapy in male dogs

SYNTHETIC ANTI-ANDROGENS
anti-androgens may have several mechanisms of action:
[a]
osaterone and cyproterone are progestogens which are principally
anti-androgenic
{b]
flutamide inhibits androgen uptake and/or nuclear binding of androgen
[c] 
conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone
[d]
formestane is an aromatase inhibitor which inhibits the conversion of
androgen to oestrogen in peripheral tissue
Adverse effects of synthetic anti-androgens
General
 adverse effects of these agents have not been reported in dogs, but in man
include nausea, gastrointestinal upsets and gynaecomastia
Specific adwerse effects in the bitch
 these agents have no clinical indication in the bitch
Specific adverse effects in the dog
 prolonged anti-androgen administration may result in a reduction in semen
quality and poor fertility
Clinical use of synthetic anti-androgens in the bitch
 there are no clinical indications for the use of these products in the bitch
Clinical use of synthetic anti-androgens in the dog
Benign prostatic byperplasia (see 17.7)
dogs with prostatic hyperplasia may respond to the administration of anti-
androgens by a reduction in prostatic size and disappearance of the clinical
signs
the concern with the use of these products is that there may also be a reduction
in fertility
 flutamide has been shown to reduce prostatic size with no change in libido or
sperm output
314
 Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 finasteride has been shown to produce a dramatic decrease in prostatic size and
a reduction in the secretion of prostatic fluid; however, total spermatozoal
output did not change and fertility remained unaltered
· formestane has not been evaluated for use in dogs
NB: Other preparations that may be used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia
 include progestogens and oestrogens.
Prostatic neoplasia (see 17.7)
 anti-androgens have not been reported for use in cases of prostatic neoplasia;
however, flutamide, finasteride and formestane have been shown to be useful
for the control of clinical signs in man

Reproductive Biotechnology
There have been substantial advances in reproductive biotechnology over the last
50 years, commencing with artificial insemination with fresh semen, followed by
 cryopreservation of semen and now new reproductive technologies are widely used
in many veterinary species and some are now being introduced for use in the dog
and bitch.
28.1 ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION
Principles of artificial insemination
Artificial insemination (Al) is the technique of collecting semen from a male
animal, and placing it into the reproductive tract of the female.
AI may involve the use of:
[a]
freshly collected semen
[b]
semen that has been diluted and chilled
[c]
 semen that has been frozen and thawed
 AI is widely used throughout the world
in some countries there is limited use of AI because of the restrictions imposed
by the national registering authorities
there is, however, increasing interest in frozen semen inseminations
worldwide
before AI is undertaken a semen sample should be collected from the dog to
ensure it is of suitable quality, and to familiarize the dog with the procedure
Adwantages of artificial insemination
 AI reduces the requirement to transport animals
it overcomes the quarantine restrictions that prevent the movement of animals
from one country to another
it increases the genetic pool available to an individual breed within a country
 it reduces the disease risk when unknown animals enter a kennel for mating

Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
in some countries the use of AI may reduce the spread of infectious diseases
in certain circumstances, artificial insemination may be useful when natural
mating is difficult, for example bitches which ovulate when they are not in
standing oestrus or bitches that have hyperplasia of the vaginal floor
semen may be collected from male animals which due to age, debility, back

the greatest area of interest is probably the storage of genetic material by freez-
ing semen for insemination at a future date
Disdwantages of artificial insemination
collection of semen from some dogs may be difficult
semen from some dogs is not suitable for chilling or freeze-thawing
there is the potential for error in sample identification
semen that is cryopreserved has poorer quality and lower fertility than fresh
semen; in the author's laboratory we have shown that much of this is associated
with ultra-structural changes of the sperm [1], and this knowledge may assist
there are important ethical dilemmas, especially concerning surgical techniques
of artificial insemination, and they are frequently not considered [2]
Regulation concerning the use of artificial insemination
 in some countries pups which are the result of AI can only be registered if the
national registering authority has given prior permission
specific regulations are set regarding the import and export of semen by
national veterinary health organizations
specific regulations can change quickly depending upon national disease status
and these should always be checked before embarking on semen transportation
(e.g. regulations may alter if there is a change in national status relating to
 poultry since many semen extenders contain egg yolk)
additional regulations govern the transportation of frozen semen which is
shipped in liquid nitrogen (a dangerous cargo)
during shipping semen may be inspected by radiographic (x-ray) examination;
in the author's laboratory we have shown that this does not have a detrimental
effect on semen quality or fertility [3]
Methods of use of semen
 in the author's laboratory we have demonstrated a significant deleterious
impact on semen quality of a number of the procedures and practices used in
semen preservation [4-5]; this information is important since avoidance of
these has had a significant impact upon clinical application of this technology
to dogs

NB: It is perfectly feasible to collect several semen samples within 1 day from a
normal dog [6].
Fresh semen
may be used diluted or undiluted

unwilling dog, injury)
Chilled semen
 semen may be stored for a short period of time by chilling and re-warming:
(a]   this allows transportation of semen
(b)  this may be useful when there is short-term unavailability of the dog
Frozen semen
 semen may be stored for long periods of time by freezing and thawing:
(a]}   this allows transportation of semen
(b)   genetic material may be stored for a long period of time
Pathogens that may be spread in dog semen
little information is known about transmission of infectious organisms in
semen:
[a]
canine herpes virus may be transmitted at coitus, but it seems likely that
this is via direct contact rather than within semen
{b]
rabies virus is unlikely to be found in semen except possibly during a few
days before overt clinical signs of the disease
[c]
canine transmissible venereal tumour may be transmitted at coitus, prob-
ably by contact and not in semen
Semen preservation
semen may be preserved by the following methods:
[a]
 fresh and cooled to room temperature
[b)
diluted and cooled to 5°C
[c]
diluted and frozen (-196*C) then thawed
the lifespan of preserved semen depends upon the preservation method [7]:
[a]
fresh semen: 4 hours (although this may be lengthened by initial dilution)
[b]
diluted and cooled semen: 4 days
[c]
diluted and frozen semen: indefinite
 semen is normally diluted in an *extender solution’ which aims to:
[a]
 protect spermatozoa during cooling/freezing/warming
[b)
supply an energy source to spermatozoa
[c]
maintain pH, osmolarity and ionic strength
318
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
for many species the optimal pH for survival is approximately 7.0. During
storage hydrogen ions are produced by spermatozoa therefore the pH falls.
Control of pH is important and many agents have been used:
[a]
 phosphate buffer
[b]
egg yolk
[c)]
 milk proteins
[d)
 zwitterionic buffers, e.g. Tris, Tes, Hepes
hypotonic diluents are harmful because they lead to a gain in intracellular water
and redistribution of ions; hypertonic diluents are less harmful because they
lead to water loss and a reduction in the likelihood of intracellular ice crystal-
lization. Seminal plasma is 300mOsm; thus most diluents are approximately
370mOsm
 glucose, fructose and mannose are glycolysable sugars that may be included in
semen extenders as sources of energy
the larger molecular weight sugars (ribose, arabinose) are often used as non-
penetrating cryoproctectants
antibacterial agents are usually included in semen extenders to control prolif.
eration of microorganisms
specific protective agents may be used including:
a]
milk proteins which protect against cold shock
[b]
egg yolk (low density lipoproteins) and bovine serum albumen which
 protect acrosomal and mitochondrial membranes, and protect against
cold shock
 cryoprotective agents are essential for semen freezing because they prevent ice
crystal damage; they may be divided into those that are:
[a]
 penetrating, (e.g. glycerol and dimethyl sulphoxide [DMSO])
[b]
Preparation of fresh dog semen
 a semen sample is collected as previously described (see 10.5)
 the second fraction is evaluated and used for insemination
 one ejaculate is used for each insemination
once collected, semen may be deposited into the vagina of the bitch using a
long inseminating pipette which is gently introduced near to the cervix (success
will likely be increased if semen is placed into the uterus but vaginal deposition
gives adequate pregnancy rates)
 when semen is placed in this position spermatozoa must swim through the
cervix, into the uterus and up the uterine horns
Preparation ofchilleddogsemen
 a common extender is composed of non-fat dry skimmed milk, 2.4g; glucose,
4.9g; sodium bicarbonate, 0.15 g: sufficient de-ionized water to make the

volume up to 100ml. Antimicrobial agents may then be added: penicillin
150000 IU, and streptomycin 150 000 mg
alternatively a low-fat pasteurized cow's milk extender can be prepared by
heating the milk until it starts to simmer, and then allowing it to cool to 37°C
the extender is kept at 37*C in a water bath immediately before use
the semen is collected and evaluated
a small portion of semen is mixed with a small volume of the extender and
then evaluated
providing that the extender has no deleterious effect, the remaining semen is
diluted with the extender at 37°C
it is preferable to dilute the semen in a semen:extender ratio of 1:4
the extended semen is cooled slowly to 5°C and stored at this temperature
slow cooling can be achieved by placing the extended semen in an insulated
vial which is then put in a refrigerator
 semen may be transported before being inseminated
transportation can be easily achieved using a wide-mouthed thermos flask
partially filled with ice cubes

semen is normally warmed slowly by placing the vials in a water bath at 37°C
uterine insemination is best with semen that has been chilled and vaginal depo-
sition is not recommended
Preparation of frozen-thawed dog semen[8]
an extender containing: Tris, 6.06 g; fructose, 2.5 g; citric acid, 3.4 g: de-ionized
water, 184 ml is used. To this is added glycerol and egg yolk to a final concen-
tration of 8% and 20%, respectively. Often penicillin and streptomycin are
added to the extender before use as described above
a small portion of semen is mixed with a small volume of the extender and
then evaluated
providing that the extender has no deleterious effect, the remaining semen is
diluted with the extender at 37*C:
[a]
it is preferable to make a volume:volume dilution rather than to try and
obtain a standard spermatozoal concentration

following dilution the sample is re-evaluated, and then placed in insulated vials
vials are slowly cooled to 5°C and allowed to equilibrate for 2-4 hours
diluted semen is then loaded into 0.5 ml straws in a cold room
straws are frozen at standard freezing rates in liquid nitrogen vapour, before
being plunged into liquid nitrogen
 straws are generally thawed rapidly (70°C for 10 seconds) before being placed
at 37*C, or thawed at a medium rate by placing in a water bath at 37°C
using frozen-thawed semen

Insemination
the accurate timing of insemination is essential when poor-quality semen is
used, or when the use of cryopreserved semen is contemplated (this has short
longevity in the female tract):
[a]   t
 the ideal time is between 2 and 5 days after ovulation
[b]  
 for frozen semen, insemination should be performed on the basis of
 plasma (serum) progesterone (detection of the fertilization period) (see
11.2 and 11.3)
[c]
for chilled semen, insemination should be performed on the basis of
plasma (serum) progesterone
[d]
for fresh semen, insemination may be performed on the basis of vaginal
endoscopy and vaginal cytological assessment (detection of the fertile
period)
a minimum of 150 × 10° normal motile spermatozoa should be present in each
inseminate
fe wer sperm may be used if uterine insemination is used
natural mating results in vaginal contractions that propel the ejaculate cranially
into the uterus; these contractions are generally absent when a bitch is artifi-
cially inseminated and therefore spermatozoal transport is reduced
uterine insemination results in a higher success rate than does vaginal
insemination:
[a)
 uterine insemination is necessary for reasonable success with frozen semen
[b)

Insemination techniques
Intrawaginal insemination
·a rigid plastic catheter is required, about 30cm long for a large bitch
 attach a plastic syringe; if this has a rubber plunger it is best to wash the syringe
out first with distilled water as rubber is toxic to spermatozoa
 suck the inseminate into the catheter; if fresh semen is being used (small
volume) it need not enter the syringe
initially the catheter is introduced vertically through the vulval lips, but at the
level of the ischium it is directed cranially; the vagina of the bitch is relatively long
 if the bitch will allow, the catheter can usually be palpated through the abdomi-
nal wall and the cervix is located as a hard structure cranial to it
 the bitch's hind limbs are raised off the ground and the semen expelled; it may
then be necessary to inject air down the catheter to ensure that it is empty;
homologous seminal plasma is a preferred flushing medium since this increases
pregnancy rate [9]
 stimulating the bitch's vestibule with a finger is said to stimulate vaginal con-
tractions which aid passage of semen into the uterus; vaginal stimulation also
increases uterine contractions [9]
Reproductive Biotechnology
321
 after 10 minutes, or if the bitch struggles, she is allowed to stand
 urination should be prevented for 10 minutes; reflux of a lot of fluid indicates
a poor insemination
● the timing of insemination is discussed in 11.2; two inseminations should be
made where possible, on alternate days
Intrauterine insemination
it is very difficult to place a catheter through the bitch's cervix into the uterus
because:
(a)  the vagina is long and narrow (up to 20cm long)
(b)  the cervical opening is small, and placed at an angle to the vagina
several  methods   have  therefore 
been
n developedto allow
uterine
insemination:
Foley catheter technique
 an especially designed Foley catheter may be used to perform an effective
uterine insemination:
[a}
the catheter has the bulb positioned at the catheter tip
(b)a second catheter with a side exit port is inserted through the Foley
catheter
 the catheter is inserted into the vagina up to the level of the cervix and the
bulb is inflated; this forms a seal against the cranial vaginal wall
 the second catheter is advanced and the semen is deposited; semen can only
run forwards through the cervix and does not drain back along the vagina
the second catheter is withdrawn inside the Foley catheter, thereby closing the
side exit ports
both catheters are left in place for up to 15 minutes:
[a]   t
this ensures that a pool of semen is located next to the cervix
(b)  this may simulate the copulatory tie and result in vaginal contractions
the principle of the technique is excellent, but there is often leakage of semen
around and through the catheters
'Norwegian’ catheter technique
 consists of an outer plastic catheter and inner metal catheter with rounded
bulb-ended tip (Figure 28.1)
the outer plastic catheter is inserted into the vagina to the level of the cervix
the cervix is palpated transabdominally (Figure 28.2)
 the inner catheter is pushed forwards to the cervix and at the same time the
cervix is re-orientated transabdominally; the aim is to produce a straight line
from the vagina into the cervix so that the inner catheter can be directed
through the cervical canal
this technique works very well but requires training and considerable
practice

through the cervical os.
 it is impossible in large, obese or frightened animals with a tense abdomen
 this technique can be augmented by injection of radiographic contrast medium
to ensure correct placement of the catheter through the cervix; the author has
demonstrated that this has minimal effect on semen quality [10]
Endoscopic technique
 this method requires a rigid endoscope and inflation system, preferably with a
(' a) dn adosa au ie raae e huop rg s
Reproductive Biotechnology
323
the endoscope is inserted into the vagina and advanced to the level of the cervix
inflation of the vagina is useful for allowing the identification of the
cervical os
the os is positioned in the dorsal wall of the vagina
 the inseminating catheter is inserted through the endoscope and the deflection
device is used to direct the catheter into the os
the technique works very well, although a small number of bitches need to be
sedated otherwise movement of the bitch makes placement of the catheter very
difficult; re versible sedation with the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist drugs such
 as medetomidine appears to be ideal
the technique requires training and practice before catheterization can be
achieved reliably
Surgical technique
 the ethics of performing surgery to achieve insemination have been questioned
[2]; at least in the UK this procedure can only be performed if for valid reasons
a non-surgical insemination cannot be achieved
 requires general anaesthesia
a small caudal ventral midline laparotomy incision is made
the uterine body is lifted into the incision
a fine over-the-needle intravenous catheter is placed into the lumen of the
uterine body
padded bowel clamps are placed on the uterus distal to the catheter
the semen is introduced slowly into the uterus and runs forwards into the
uterine horns
haemostasis; no sutures are required
the incision is closed routinely
the technique is simple and can be performed rapidly
NB: Our ethical appraisal of the use of AI in dogs was the first for reproductive
 technologies in this species and adds important information to the debate regarding
these technologies [2].
Success with artificial insemination
 in the bitch there appears to be a substantial difference in spermatozoal longev-
ity for fresh, chilled-rewarmed and frozen-thawed semen; the longest periods
of time for sperm survival appear for fresh semen, with frozen-thawed semen
having the poorest longevity (Figure 28.4) [8]
fertility rates are related to spermatozoal damage during preservation and to
spermatozoal longevity
furthermore, we have shown that sperm abnormalities induced by cryopreser-
vation result in decreased ability of sperm to attach to female reproductive tract
epithelium and therefore contribute to the lower fertility [11] (see also 11.2)

Incubation time (min)
Figure 28.4 At time zero there are substantial differences in the quality of fresh, chilled-

female reproductive tract results in the most rapid reduction in quality of frozen-thawed
semen, and the east effect on fresh semen.
extensive bitch management is required when frozen-thawed semen is used,
since insemination has to be performed during the fertilization period
it may be extremely difficult to preserve the semen from certain dogs; the reason
for this is not known

28.2 ENHANCING FERTILITY IN MALES AND FEMALES
WITH REPRODUCTIVE TRACT DISEASE [12]
Embryo transfer
 in some species where the female has uterine disease, embryos are harvested
shortly after fertilization and then transferred to a recipient female who must
be at a similar stage of the oestrous cycle to the donor
 transferring the embryos is often done surgically either via laparotomy or
laparoscopically because this reduces the risk of introducing infection into the
 q  x    i r      
cervix is closed
 special culture media and specific temperature and humidity are required for
optimal storage of the embryo between collection and transfer, and optimally
the interval should be as short as possible
 experimental studies have demonstrated that embryos harvested from bitches
at natural cycles can be preserved by freezing and can then be transferred non-
surgically to recipient bitches
 at the moment collection methods have involved surgically removing the repro-
ductive tracts and flushing them, but it is likely that in the future methods will
be developed to allow transcervical collection of embryos; any such methods
would be improved by regimes that increase the number of oocytes ovulated
at a given oestrous cycle (termed ‘superovluation')
In vitro fertilization
·in vitro fertilization can be a useful technique when only small number of
oocytes are ovulated, or when there is disease of the reproductive tract but not
ovaries, or where an animal dies but its ovaries can be quickly recovered
 the technique involves the collection of oocytes and fertilizing them in the labo-
ratory when they are mature before they are transferred into a recipient female
(immature oocytes can also be collected and matured in the laboratory before
being fertilized)
 there are substantial difficulties with in vitro fertilization in bitches, notably
the difficulties described for embryo transfer and the challenges of collection
of oocytes without surgically removing the ovary; the latter has yet to be over-
come in the bitch
use of immature oocytes is fraught with difficulties because culture of canine
oocytes is not particularly successful with maturation rates of approximately
2.5 % [13,14,1.5]
 the author's laboratory has been preeminent in studying in vitro maturation of
canine oocytes; data have added to knowledge of the basic biology as well as
improving the potential for clinical application of the technique [16,17,18]
only one successful pregnancy has been reported following the transfer of
   e        s
326
Dog Breeding, Whelping and Puppy Care
 pre-ovulatory oocytes were collected, so whilst this demonstrates the possible
applicability of the technique it creates practical difficulties for it to be used in
clinical practice
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection and related techniques
 the injection of a single sperm into a mature oocyte is described as intra-
cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
the technique is used in human fertility clinics where there are very few sperm
available; potentially sperm harvested from the epididymis of recently dead
pasn aq Plnoo sop
 whilst canine oocytes can be fertilized using ICSI, subsequent development of
the embryos has not be shown and the technique as yet has no clinical
applicability
there are other similar techniques designed to help sperm cross the zona pel-
lucida and fertilize oocytes:
{a]
zona drilling
[b)]  ]
 partial zona dissection (PZD)
(c) 
sub zonal injection (SUZI)
 as yet these have not been utilized in dogs
28.3
HARVESTING GONADAL TISSUE
 to date most of the reproductive biotechnology methods has used sperm col-
lected at ejaculation, oocytes harvested after surgical removal of the ovaries,
or embryo flushed after surgical removal of the tract
essentially there are technical challenges to the techniques that are currently
limiting clinical application
however in some circumstances salvage procedures may be necessary to collect
 gonadal tissue from recently deceased animals
Salvage techniques in the bitch
collection of ovaries immediately after death offers the potential for collection
of oocytes which could potentially be frozen, or matured and fertilized before
either being frozen or transferred; whilst these techniques are available in other
species as of yet they have not been demonstrated to be effective in dogs
Salvage techniques in the dog
 collection of testes immediately after death allows collection of sperm from the
tail of the epididymis; these sperm can be inseminated immediately or frozen
and thawed
Reproductive Biotechnology
327
in the author's laboratory we conducted the principal study on cryopreserva-
tion of dog epididymal sperm [20]
epididymal sperm are immature and success rates are lower than with ejacu-
lated sperm but this technique has some clinical use in particularly valuable
animals (most commonly it might be used for preservation of endangered
canine species rather than the domestic dog)
28.4 CLONING
As currently practiced cloning is the technique of taking the nucleus of a mature
cell and placing it into an oocyte that has had its genetic material removed (an
enucleated oocyte).
this is achieved by staining the genetic material of the oocyte so that it can be
identified and sucked out of the oocyte, and then by injecting the nucleus of
the adult cell (often a fbroblast because of their high developmental compe-
tence) into the peri-vitelline space of the oocyte; an electrical impulse is used
to initiate the process of fusion and activation of the oocyte
·the new oocyte then contains the genetic material of the adult cell and it
is placed into the uterus of a recipient animal to develop as a normal
pregnancy
in dogs successful clones have been produced using the nucleus of fbroblasts
placed into enucleated oocytes
 technically the process is very difficult and expensive and only few clones are
likely to be produced
 clones are only genetically identical to the adult cell which does not mean that
they have the same phenotypic appearance, nor same temperament or charac-
teristics of the donor animal
