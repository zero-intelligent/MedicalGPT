Laboratory Equipment
Laboratory equipment
The variety of sophisticated laboratory equipment in a veterinary practice will depend
largely on the size and scope of the practice itself. There are several pieces of core
equipment that are expected in every practice that performs in-house testing and
analysis.
Microscope
Purpose
The microscope is the most important piece of equipment in the veterinary clinic labo-
ratory. The microscope is used to review fecal, urine, blood, and cytology samples on
a daily basis (see Figure 1.1). Understanding how the microscope functions, how it oper
ates, and how to care for it will improve the reliability of your results and prolong the
life of this valuable piece of equipment.
Parts and functions of a compound microscope (Figure 1.1)
(A) Arm: Used to carry the microscope.
(B) Base: Supports the microscope and houses the light source.
(C) Oculars (or eyepieces): The lens of the microscope you look through. The ocular
also magnifies the image. The total magnification can be calculated by multiplying
the objective power by the ocular power. Oculars come in different magnifications,
but 10x magnification is common.

(E) Interpupillary adjustment: This allows the oculars to move closer or further away
from one another to match the width of an individual's eyes. when looking through
the microscope,one should see only a single field ofview.When viewing a sample,

(F) Nosepiece: The nosepiece holds the objective lenses. The objectives are mounted
on a rotating turret so they can be moved into place as needed. Most nosepieces
can hold up to five objectives.
(G) objective lenses: The objective lens is the lens closest to the object being viewed
and its function is to magnify it. Objective lenses are available in many powers, but

stage height. Fine adjustment is used for more delicate, high power adjustment
that would require fine tuning.
(P) mluminator: The illuminator is the light source for the microscope, usually situated
in the base. The brightness of the light from the illuminator can be adjusted to suit
your preference and the object you are viewing.
Kohler illumination
What is Kohfer ilfumination?
Kohler illumination is a method of adjusting a microscope in order to provide optimal
illumination by focusing the light on the specimen. When a microscope is in Kohler,
specimens will appear clearer, and in more detail.

Kohier illumination
(1) Mount the specimen slide on the stage and focus under 10x.
(2) Close the iris diaphragm completely.
(3) If the ball of light is not in the center, use the condenser centering screws to move
it so that it is centered.
(4) Using the condenser adjustment knobs, raise or lower the condenser until the edges
of the field becomes sharp (see Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3).
(5) Open the iris diaphragm until the entire field is illuminated.

Microscope care and maintenance
Routinecare andpropermaintenance of microscope willensure goodperformanceover
ered when routine techniques fail to produce optimal performance of the microscope.
Laboratory Equipment 
Cleaning and maintenance supplies
Dust cover: when not in use, a microscope should be covered to protect it from dust,
hair, and any other possible sources of dirt. It is important to note that a dust cover
should never be placed over a microscope while the illuminator is still on.
Lens tissue: Lint-free lens tissues are delicate wipes that would not scratch the surface
Lens cleaner: Lens cleaning solution assists in removing fingerprints and smudges on
thesurface.
pressed air is clean, and avoids possible contamination of saliva particles.
Maintenance tips
(1) whenever the microscope is not in use, turn off the illuminator. This will greatly
extend the life of the bulb, as well as keep the temperature down during extended
periods of laboratory work.
(2) When cleaning the microscope, use distilled water or lens cleaner. Avoid using other
chemicals or solvents, as they may be corrosive to the rubber or lens mounts.
(3) After using immersion oil, clean off any residue immediately. Avoid rotating the
40x objective through immersion oil.If this should occur,immediately clean the
40x objective with lens cleaner before the oil has a chance to dry.
(4) Do not be afraid to use many sheets of lens tissue when cleaning. Use a fresh piece
(or a clean area of the same piece) when moving to a different part of the micro-
scope. This avoids tracking dirt/oil/residue to other areas of the microscope.
position (4x or 10x). This placement allows for the greatest distance between the
stage and the objective. If the microscope is bumped, the likelihood of an objective
becoming damaged by the stage surface will be greatly minimized.
Troubleshooting
"I can focus my slide under 1ox, but not under 40x."
A common reason for this is that the slide is upside down. Double check which side the
smear is on (may not be the same side as the labe!) and try focusing again.
Another cause could be dried immersion oil on the 4ox objective that is obstructing
your view. When switching from oil immersion (100x) to 40x, there is a good chance
that the tip of the 40x objective could be dragged through some immersion oil. If it is
not immediately cleaned off, it will dry, producing a thick haze.
cleaning, use a dry piece of lens paper to polish the objective.

Figure 1.4 Water artifact seen on the surface of the red blood cells (1ooox magnifi
cation).
"In hematology, when I focus under 4ox, my red blood cells appear shiny.
This is most likely due to water artifact during the staining and drying process (see
Figure 1.4). To make visualization of the cells easier, add a small drop of immersion oil
of excess oil using the side of your finger. Be very gentle when doing this, and use a
clean finger each fime you wipe. Wiping too hard or rough will cause your smear to rub
off. This technique will leave a very thin layer of oil on your smear. The film is thin
enough that you can use the 40x objective without running the risk of the lens becom-
ing contaminated with oil.
Try focusing under 40x again, and the shininess should have been resolved.
'There's no light coming from the illuminator.'
The first assumption is always that the bulb is burnt out, but it is a good idea to check
a couple of other possibilities as well.
If the iris diaphragm is closed and the brightness of the illuminator is at its lowest,
the light may be so small that it appears as if there is no light present.
Check to make sure the cord is fully plugged into the back of the microscope. This
plug can become dislodged slightly during transport and microscope set up.
If your microscope is the type that uses fuses, it may be the fuse-not the bulb-that
needsreplacing.

Clean up
When the use of the microscope is complete, following proper clean up procedures will
improve the quality of images that are viewed and extend the life of the microscope
and its components:
(1) Remove the slide from the stage and dispose of it properly.
surface.
(3) Lower the stage and move the smallest objective into place.
(4)Clean the objectivelens and oculars after every use.The order in which they are
cleaned is important. Cleaning the 100x objective first and then moving onto other
tissue and lens cleaner, begin with cleaning the oculars, then the 4x objective, the
10x objective, 40x objective, and finish with the 100x objective lens.
Centrifuge
trifuge types exist for different purposes, such as those for microhematocrit, fecal,
urine, and blood samples. It is not uncommon to use a multiuse centrifuge that can be
maintenance, and cleaning instructions.
Microhematocrit centrifuge
This centrifuge is used exclusively for spinning down microhematocrit tubes (see Figure
also provide a plasma sample for protein analysis.
Clinical centrifuge
Clinical centrifuges are available in two main types: a variable angle centrifuge or a
fixed angle centrifuge.
The variable angle centrifuge (also called a horizontal centrifuge) has swinging
tube to form the sediment (see Figure 1.6). Once the rotation stops,the buckets return
in a slight remixing of the sample. This effect should be taken into consideration when
preparing a sample.
The fixed angle centrifuge has buckets that are in a fixed position, typically about
50¬∞(see Figure1.7).The specimen tubes are held in this position for the entire centrifu
gation process.

tocrit tubes only. It is preset to 10,0o0rpm.

do notmove during the centrifugationprocess.
StatSpin
Another option is the StatSpin (see Figure 1.8). This centrifuge is a fixed angle centrifuge
designed for small samples. It has a faster spinning speed, and as a result, a shorter
processing time. These qualities could be beneficial in a small animal or exotic veteri-
nary practice.
Refractometer
The purpose of a refractometer is to measure the refractive index of a solution. When
measuring a solution (i.e., urine), light passes through the sample and bends. The angle
of this refraction is visualized as a shadow and correlates to the concentration of the
solution. Veterinary specific refractometers are now on the market allowing for minor
differences between dog and cat urine specific gravity and total protein values (see
Figure 1.9).
The most common use of a refractometer in veterinary laboratories is to measure
urine specific gravity and plasma total protein. Refractometers have built-in scales to
measure both of these, and some brands of refractometers will also possess a refractive
index scale. This scale, with the use of an appropriate conversion chart, can be used to
measure the concentration of many other solutions.
Tips: Cover the entire prism with the liquid (urine or plasma) being examined.
Reading urine and plasma at room temperature will provide the most accurate
results.

Calibration
It is good practice to calibrate the refractometer at the beginning of each day. This is
achieved by applying a large drop of distilled water on the prism and adjusting the blue/
white line to read exactly 1.ooo on the scale. The adjustment knob or screw is located
on various places of a refractometer: therefore, the manufacturer's guide will need to
be consulted.

Chemistry analyzers
There are a wide variety of chemistry analyzers available for veterinary use. Most use
the principles of photometry to quantify analytes, such as enzymes, proteins, and other
constituents in the blood. Electrochemical methods are used to analyze ionic com-
analyzers, or they may be combined into one.
Another variation among analyzers is the way they facilitate the photometry testing
procedure.A sampleneeds tobe added to a substrate to initialize the test.Examples
include slides, rotors, or cartridges (see Figure 1.10).

ers available, this book cannot describe the operation, maintenance, and cleaning of
maintenance is essential for ensuring the precision and accuracy of the analyzer. It may
also be necessary for complying with the manufacturer's warranty.
Hematology analyzers
As with chemistry analyzers, there are many types of hematology analyzers to choose
from. There are several different types of technology used to quantify cell types, and

are impedance, laser-based, and optical fluorescence. An analyzer may use one, or a
combination of these technologies to detect and enumerate the cells present in the
sample.
While the analyzers can provide a large amount of information about the patient, it
is recommended to follow up with a manual examination to confirm readings, and review
morphologies.

Blood Analysis
Hematology
Proper blood collection and handling techniques
Blood is collected from animals in order to conduct many tests, ranging from hematol-
ogy parameters to clinical chemistries, and even to evaluate coagulation disorders.
Good technique when obtaining blood samples is important to maximize the reliability
of the results.
Blood can be collected from many sites on animals; however, the most common for
amphibian, and avian species have different locations for blood collection specific to
the species. It is important to collect a sufficient quantity of blood for all the tests to
be conducted.
tainer technique is preferred,as this reduces the chance for a clotted sample, draws
the accurate amount into the tube, and is considered sterile. Anticoagulant blood tubes
should be gently inverted a number of times immediately after collection.Utilizing a
blood rocking machine may be useful; however, overmixing or prolonged mixing of a
sample can cause cellular damage.
Some tests require an anticoagulated sample (whole blood) or plasma, while others
compounds within the blood mixed in a solution that will not allow the sample to clot.
This can be spun down in a centrifuge to separate the cells (white blood cell [WBC], red
blood cell [RBC], etc.) from the liquid (plasma); but remember, even when spun down,
the sample has not clotted,it is just separated.Serum is often used for chemistries and
is theliquid portion ofablood sample affer it has clotted.The difference between
serum does not, because those clotting factors are caught up in the clot.
Blood collection tubes
The tubes used to collect both types of samples (anticoagulated = whole blood and
plasma; clotted = serum) come in many different colors and contents. It is important to

(1) It is important to begin with two clean, dust free microscope slides. If slides are
dirty or dusty, polish them using lint-free lens tissue.
(2) Using a capillary tube, obtain a sample of whole blood. Ensure that the blood is
well mixed by gently inverting it several times before sampling with the capillary
tube.
(3) If blood is not well mixed, cells begin to settle causing the cell distribution on your
PBS to be inaccurate.
(4) Place a small drop of blood (2-3mm) at the end of your slide.

Staining
After a smear has completely air dried,it must be stained to identify cells and their
characteristics. A Romanowsky-type stain, Wright's stain, is used in hematology to stain
blood smears. A commercial stain that is commonly used is Diff-Quick, which is a modi-
fied Wright's stain (see Figure 2.9).
The stain consists of three solutions that fix and stain various components of the
cells. The first solution, a fixative, consists of 95% methanol. The second solution, eosin,
has an acidic pH and stains cell cytoplasms and eosinophilic granules. The third solution,
methylene blue, has an alkaline pH and stains the nuclei of the cells.
The slide exposure time to each solution varies slightly depending upon the desired
result or sample being stained. Typically, dipping a slide into each solution five times

for one second each time dip will give adequate staining. This can be adjusted to
alter the appearance of cells. It is important to rinse the slide after the last dip
into stain #3. Distilled water is preferred. The now stained smear should be allowed to
air dry. Rapid drying, such as a hair dryer or waving the slide, will cause crenation
(distortion) of the RBCs.
Tip: Have one set of stains for blood and "clean" cytology specimens. Keep another
set of "dirty" stains for fecal and ear cytology.
Tip: Old stain may precipitate, causing artifacts to appear on your smear. Replace/

Evaluating a blood film to complement automated analyzers
Automatedanalyzersare afastandconvenientway toevaluate apatient'sbloodvalues.
With this being said, analyzers should not completely eliminate the need to visually
examine the blood smear microscopically. Microscopic examination accomplishes two
important things: (1) you can confirm automated data, and (2) it allows you to evaluate
the morphology of the blood cells. Performing a manual examination does not have to
take much time, and the more often it is performed, the more proficient a technician
will become.
Erythrocytes
Under 1ooox magnification, examine the erythrocytes for their size and color. This will
help to confirm the MCV and MCHC values calculated by the automated analyzer. A
large variation in anisocytosis should be reflected in the analyzer's RDw (red cell dis-
tribution width) value.Increased numbersof polychromatophils can suggest anincreased
reticulocyte count and should be confirmed with a manual reticulocyte count if your
analyzer is unable to perform this function. In addition, examine the erythrocytes for
abnormal morphological characteristics and parasitic/infectious inclusions. Currently,

Activated clotting time
Purpose
An activated clotting time (ACT) is an in-house test that is used to determine how por-
tions (clotting factors) of the clotting cascade are working. The ACT will be prolonged
in patients with faulty clotting factors and a low platelet count. Automated analyzers
are becoming more common, making this test obsolete.

Urinalysis
Sample collection
The method in which a urine sample is obtained is very important to the interpretation
of the urinalysis itself. The method of collection should afways be noted on the urinalysis
requisition at the time of analysis.
Free catch (voided sample)
Free catch samples are the easiest to collect and are often brought in by owners. They

that still maintains adequate quality control. A midstream, first-morning collection will
provide the best sample for analysis (see Table 3.1).
Materials required
‚óè Collection cup or ladle
‚óè Pie plate or shallow dish (useful for female dogs)
‚óè Nonabsorbent litter for collections in cats
Specimen container
Good container choice for owners
‚óè Leak proof with a tight-fitting lid
‚óèOpaque

tamination. This can lead to erroneous interpretations.
‚óè For cats: Commercial nonabsorbent litter for urine collection is available. As a sub-
stitute, well-rinsed aquarium gravel or Styrofoam chips can be used as well.
Bladder expression
In small animals, bladder expression can be performed if a free catch sample is not
possible. Like free catch samples, this collection method provides an adequate sample
for routine urinalysis, but is not appropriate for bacterial culturing (see Table 3.2).

Table 3.1 Advantages and disadvantages of a free catch (voided) sample.
Free catch (voided sample)
Advantages
+ No risk or complications to the patient.
+ Can be used by the client.
Disadvantages
+ High amount of contamination of cells, bacteria and debris from the
genitourinary tract, surrounding fur and the environment.
+ Sample is unsuitable for culture.
Table 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages of bladder expression.
Bladder expression
Advantages
+ Decreased risk of trauma (if done correctly).
+Sample can be obtained when needed.
Disadvantages
+ Excessive pressure can result in trauma to the patient.
+ If the bladder does not contain sufficient quantities of urine at the time,
expression may not be successful.
Same amount of contamination seen as with a voided sample.
+ Sample is unsuitable for culture.
For collection, the animal is standing or placed in lateral recumbancy, and the bladder
is palpated. Once it is located, gentle, steady pressure is applied to the bladder until the
animal begins to urinate. It is important not to apply too much pressure as bladder
rupture may occur. This method should never be used in patients with suspected
obstruction or fragile bladders due to increased risk of rupture.
Materials required
‚óè Collection dish
‚óè Assistance with restraint
Catheterization
Catheterization involves inserting a rubber catheter into the urethra and feeding it up
to the bladder of the patient to collect a sample. A sterile syringe is attached to the end
of thecatheter and urineisdrawn out.Thisprocedurevaries slightly depending upon
species and sex. In any case, sterility is important. Sterile catheters, sterile lubricant,
and sterile gloves should be worn to prevent infection. For female animals, a speculum

Cystocentesis is another method for collecting a sterile urine sample, and therefore is
easily restrained animals. Sedation may be required to achieve this. Typically. the
patient is restrained in dorsal recumbancy and the bladder is palpated. An ultrasound
may also be used to visualize the bladder and help guide the needle. The site should
be cleaned with 70% alcohol and aseptic techniques should be followed. A 1"-1 1/2",
25-22 gauge needle, attached to a syringe, is inserted through the abdominal wall and
into the bladder. Once inserted, the needle is never redirected as this could cause
the syringe is retracted and urine is drawn out. Once the sample has been obtained,
For female dogs and cats, the needle is inserted along the midline of the caudal
abdomen. For male dogs, the needle is inserted caudal to the umbilicus, just off to the
side of the sheath (see Table 3.4).
Materials required

‚óè10-12 mL syringe
‚óèAssistance with restraint.
Sample preservation
Fresh urine should be examined within 20 minutes of collection. If that is not possible,
then a method of preservation should be considered.
60   Veterinary Technician's Handbook of Laboratory Procedures
Table 3.4 Advantages and disadvantages of cystocentesis.
Advantages
+ Less of a risk of causing an iatrogenic infection (compared with catheterization).
+ No contamination of urine; therefore, the sample is suitable for culture.
Disadvantages
+ Requires adequate volume of urine within the bladder.
May cause microscopic hematuria.
Before choosing a preservative, consider the following:
(1) The method of sample collection used
(2) The analyses to be performed
(3) The biochemical method that will be used
(4) The time delay between urine collection and analysis.
Note: Always indicate the type of preservative used on the requisition.
In vitro changes occurring in unpreserved urine
Physical characteristics
Turbidity:Increase-as bacteria,and possibly crystals,multiply.the turbidity of the
sample increases.
Odor: Becomes stronger smelling, as microbes cause increased amounts of ammonia
to be produced within the sample.
Chemical characteristics
Glucose:Decrease-asit is metabolized by cells and microbes.
Bilirubin: Decrease-bilirubin levels decrease in the presence of direct light.
Nitrite: Increase-if it is produced by the types of microbes present in the sample.
Sediment characteristics
Cellular structures: Decrease-cells begin to deteriorate in concentrated, dilute, or
acidic urine.
Crystals: Increase or decrease-depending on the solubility and pH of the sample, the
numbers of various crystals may change over time.
Refrigeration
Refrigerating a urine sample is an adequate form of preservation for up to 6 hours.
Before analyzing the sample, be sure to allow it to return to room temperature first.
Urinalysis ‚ñ†  61
This is important for the enzymatic reactions that occur during the chemical examina-
tion ofurine.Generally,enzymaticreactions occur at a slowerrate whenthe sample is
at a lower temperature. This results in false readings.

by the actions of microbes. Freezing is also adequate for most chemical tests and pre
serves the mineral content of urine. Freezing, however, is an unsuitable method of
preservation for sediment and hormonal analyses due to the resulting cellular and
protein damage.
Toluene
Toluene is an organic solvent that can be used to preserve a urine sample. Toluene
floats on the surface of the sample, preventing the loss of acetone and contamination.
Two milliliters of toluene will be adequate for 1oo mL of urine. Toluene is suitable for
preserving the chemical profile of the urine sample; however, it would not prevent the
invitro growth of microbes present in the sample.Due to the fact that toluene is a

cellular integrity of various structures within the sample. Formalin is a reducing agent,
so it doesinterfere with the chemical analysis of substances that use thisprinciple in
The use of enough formalin can result in a false negative.
Boric acid (0.8%)
The addition of boric acid to a sample will inhibit bacterial growth. Boric acid is an
appropriate preservative for sediment analysis and, with the exception of pH, chemical
analysis as well.
Commercial preservation tablets
Commercial preservation tablets are designed to inhibit microbes and control the pH
tion of urine sediment, such as leukocytes, erythrocytes, casts, and crystals.

Physical examination of urine
The physical examination of urine consists of assessing the volume,color,turbidity,
odor, and SG of a urine sample.
Volume
An accurate representation of urine volume should be assessed over a period of 24
plements). Normal daily urine output can be calculated using a rate of 1mL/kg/h.
Terminology related to urine volume
Polyuria: Increased amounts of urine volume
Oliguria: Decreased amounts of urine volume
Anuria: No urine production.
Color
Normal urine is described as being straw colored. The pigment of the urine often cor-
relates with the concentration of the sample, but this should still be confirmed with a
SG reading
To avoid discrepancies among technicians, use standard color terms when recording
your findings (see Table 3.5 and Figure 3.1).

Turbidity
Turbidity refers to the "cloudiness" of urine. An increase in turbidity in the urine can
be caused by cellular elements, crystals, microorganisms, or mucous. When examining
the turbidity of a sample, there are a few key points to remember:

specles.
To examine turbidity:
(1) with the sample in a clear tube, invert several times to ensure the sample is well
mixed.
(2) Hold the sample up in front of a piece of paper with text on it.
(4) Record as clear (0), slightly cloudy (1), cloudy (2), or turbid (3).
Odor
The odor of urine can provide insight into possible conditions that should later be con-
firmed through chemical and sediment analysis.
Again, it is important to use standard terminology to minimize discrepancies among
technicians:
Strong odor: The urine of intact male animals, especially cats and goats, is often quite
strong and should be described as such.
Ammonia: Ammonia-scented urine can be associated with cystitis. Some species of

The presence of bacteria should be confirmed during the sediment examination or
with a urine culture.
Putrid: Putrid- (or foul-) smelling urine is associated with the degradation of protein.
This can occur during infections, and should be confirmed with further testing.
Fruity:Increased ketones present inthe urine give off a fruity odor. This odor may
Specific gravity (SG)
SG is determined by assessing the density of a liquid (in this case, urine) compared with
the density of distilled water.
Measuring SG requires the use of a refractometer (see Figure 3.3).
In a correctly calibrated refractometer, distilled water should read 1.ooo. Calibration
should be checked regularly to ensure accuracy.
If the urine sample that is being tested exceeds the maximum limit of the refractom-
eter, an accurate SG can be achieved by following these steps:
(1) Mix equal portions of urine with distilled water.
(3) Multiply the last two digits of the reading by 2 in order to obtain the estimated SG

Hyposthenuria: The SG of the urine is lower than the glomerular filtrate (<1.o08).

Isosthenuria: The SG of the urine is equal to that of the glomerular filtrate
(1.008-1.012).

of dogs and cats.

The chemical examination of urine is usually performed by the use of reagent strips.

(see Figure 3.4).
There are individual tests available that can be used as well. Depending upon the
constituent tested, these alternative methods may be more/less specific or may simply
be useful as a confirmatory test.
Whichever method is chosen, it is important to review the package insert and make
note of the testing time required and any possible false positives or false negatives that
can occur.
Glucose
The term used to describeglucose in theurine is glucosuria.The reagentstrip method
for detecting glucose is specific for glucose, meaning no other sugar will cause a posi-
tive result.
Possible causes of false positives with the reagent strips are contamination with
detect any sugar (or reducing substance) in the urine, and therefore are not specific to
glucose.
Bilirubin
When bilirubin is present in the urine, the term "bilirubinuria" is used. Bilirubin is unsta-
ble in sunlight or artificial light and should therefore be tested immediately. Delaying
testing will result in false negative values.

quantities of bilirubin.
Ketones
There are three ketone bodies that are produced: acetone, acetoacetic acid, and
Œ≤-hydroxybutyric acid. Most reagent strips are sensitive to acetoacetic acid, less sensi-
tive to acetone, and do not detect Œ≤-hydroxybutyric acid. The presence of ketone bodies
in the urine, or ketonuria, is often accompanied by a fruity odor.

Before examining the sediment, we must first concentrate the sample. This is done
by centrifuging the urine. After centrifugation, the urine will be separated into two
portions: the supernatant and the sediment(see Figure 3.5).

Sediment stain
Sedimentstain canbea useful tool inthe examination ofurine.Manymicroscopicele

and one with stain, then examine and compare both.

help in eliminating these false positives.
To maintain good quality control, check your stain regularly. Examine the stain by
adding one drop to a slide, add a coverslip, and view under 40x power. Scan the area
for bacteria and stain precipitate. If these contaminants are found, discard the stain.
Sediment stain is relatively inexpensive and should be routinely replaced on a monthly
basis.
Procedure for microscopic examination of urine
(1) Pour 10 mL of the urine sample into a labeled conical centrifuge tube. If 10 mL is not
available,note thevolume usedonyourrequisition.
(2) Centrifuge the sample for 5 minutes at 1500rpm.
(3) Decant the supernatant leaving approximately O.5-1mL in the tube.
(4) Resuspend the sediment by flicking the tube with your fingers or gently mixing the
sediment and supernatant with a pipette.
(5) Transfer a drop of resuspended sediment near the end of a microscope slide with
a transfer pipette and place a coverslip over it.
(6) Opfionar: Add one drop of sediment stain to one drop of urine sediment on the
other end of the microscope slide and place a coverslip over it.

its specific gravity. Parasite eggs and cysts float to the surface, while most fecal matter
sinks to the bottom.
A common flotation medium is sodium nitrate solution. It can be purchased already
Other popular solutions include Sheather's solution and zinc sulfate.
Sheather's solution, also known as sugar solution, can be messy to work with as it is
quite sticky. It tends to float fewer eggs as compared with sodium nitrate, but it does
not distort roundworm eggs. It is readily available and inexpensive.
Zinc sulfate does an excellent job in concentrating cystic forms of protozoans. Zinc
sulfate is available from veterinary suppliers.

In comparison with the simple flotation method, the centrifugation technique is more
efficient at recovering parasite ova from a sample. It does, however, require a little
more specialized equipment.

Sample collection
Swabs
Swabs are used as a collection method for sites such as body cavities or fistulous tracts.
The goal of this method is to collect superficial cells or bacteria for preliminary or
should be taken during collection. Examples of locations where this method is ideal
would be the nasal cavity (i.e., looking for fungal spores) (see Figure 5.1) or vagina (i.e.,
establishing which phase of the estrous cycle) (see Figure 5.33).
Materials
‚óèCotton swabs (sterile swabs if culturing is desired or utilize a commercial culturette)
‚óè 0.9% Saline
‚óè Microscope slides.
Procedure
(1) Moisten the swab using O.9% saline. Using an isotonic solution, such as saline, will
preserve cell integrity and assist in microscopic evaluation.
(2) If the sample will be used for culture, a sterile swab should be used for collection
and the sample stored in the appropriate culture media. When culturing an infected
area, the mucopurulent secretions should be avoided, as these contain dead bac-
teria, yeast, microbes, and wBCs. Sampling the reddened surface of the infected
tissue will yield the microbe(s) responsible for the infection.
ficial cells. with the swab moistened, cell damage will be reduced during collection
and smear preparation.
(4) To transfer the collected cells onto microscope slides, gently roll the swab along
the length of the slide. Using a rolling technique versus rubbing the swab onto the
slide will minimize cell damage (see Figure 5.2).
(5) Allow slide to air dry and stain.

Tip: Avoid using "clean stains" for this procedure, as they will become contaminated.
An alternate method that will avoid this contamination is to use a pipette to flood the
slide with stain versus dipping the slide into the stain itself.
Fine needle biopsy
Fine needle biopsies may be obtained from various masses, lymph nodes, organs, and
nodular lesions. The principle behind a fine needle biopsy is that cells are sampled from
within the target area itself, which avoids surface contaminants, such as debris, bacte
rial contamination, or cellular contamination.
There are two methods of fine needle biopsy collection: the aspiration technique and
the nonaspiration technique.
Site preparation
The preparation required depends on the collection site and the tests to be performed.
If any body cavity is to be penetrated (such as the peritoneal or thoracic cavity)Ôºåa
to be done, a surgical prep is also warranted. Any other sampling site requires no more
Materials
‚óè Microscope slides
‚óè Surgical prep materials (if required)
21-to 25-g needle
Needle gauge selection is important and varies depending upon the mass. Gener-
ally,the softer the mass,the smaller-gauge needle is used. Using a larger needle
often results in more bleeding. In addition to blood contamination of the sample,a
large needle is less likely to collect individual cells for evaluation. Instead, it has the
tendency to collect a small biopsy of tissue. For certain masses (i.e., mast cell
tumors), a smaller needle, in conjunction with the added pressure of aspiration, could
result in degranulation of the cells.
3-to 12-cc syringe
Syringe selection also depends upon the mass. A large syringe has the potential
for creating greater amounts of negative pressure. Softer masses do not require as
much negative pressure as firmer masses.
Also consider the fact that controlling the syringe during the collection procedure
needs to be performed with one hand. Choose a syringe size that can be comfortably
handled with one hand, yet provide you with the desired negative pressure.
Fine needle biopsy: Aspiration technique
(1) with one hand, stabilize the mass.
(2) Insert the needle into the mass.
(3) Retract the plunger of the syringe to create negative pressure (see Figure 5.3).
(4) while maintaining negative pressure and without exiting the mass, redirect the
needleseveral times.
(5)Release theplunger of the syringe.

masses. The technique is somewhat similar, with the main difference being the lack of
negative pressure used during collection. Cells are collected by capillary action and
gather within the bore of the needle.
(1) with one hand, stabilize the mass.
(2) Insert the needle into the mass. Use only the attached barrel of the syringe without
the plunger inserted. An alternate method is to use the needle alone (see Figure
5.5).
(3) Redirect the needle several times.
(4) Exit the mass.
(5) Remove the needle from the syringe (if using this method), and fill the syringe with
air.
(6) Reattach the needle and eject the sample onto the slide as in the previous
method.
(7) Smear the sample using desired method.
(8) Allow to air dry.
Tissue biopsy
A tissue biopsy involves sampling a small section of tissue, rather than individual cells.
biopsied include superficial locations, such as skin or masses, internal organs (using
ultrasound-guided biopsy techniques), and intestinal biopsies using an endoscope.
126   Veterinary Technician's Handbook of Laboratory Procedures
Figure 5.6 Various sizes of punch biopsies.
Site preparation
If an external mass or a skin biopsy is desired, the hair should be clipped. Cleansing
or scrubbing of the site should be avoided, as it may distort elements of clinical
significance.
For organ biopsies, a surgical prep is required.
Tissue biopsy: Wedge
Wedge biopsies are collected using a scalpel blade to excise a small piece of tissue
When selecting the tissue to excise, be sure the sample contains tissue from the lesion,
the transition zone, and normal tissue. This will allow the pathologist to examine the
microscopic features as they transition from normal to abnormal.
Tissue biopsy: Punch

should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin.
Imprints
Imprints, or impression smears, can be made of external lesions, or of biopsies and
excised masses. Superficial cells are transferred onto a slide with little cellular disrup-
nique, and they may not be representative of the entire lesion. with certain masses,
the veterinarian may have you cut the biopsy in half and make imprint slides of the
inside surface as well. This will yield further cellular components that may not have
been present on the superficial surface.
Procedure for external lesions
(1) For external lesions, little preparation is required. Any fluid or blood should be
dabbed off prior to sampling
(2) Place a slide face down onto the lesion and press. Do not rub or scrape the slide
across the lesion.
(3) Lift the slide off and air dry before staining.
(4) Repeat this procedure a few times to create several slides for examination.

Centesis
Centesis is a process that involves the collection of bodily fluids with the use of a needle
inserted into a body cavity. Examples include peritoneal fluid from the abdominal cavity
(abdominocentesis or paracentesis), pleural fluid from the thoracic cavity (thoracocen-
spinal fluid (cisternal puncture).
Site preparation
When inserting a needle into a body cavity, the site should be aseptically prepared and
sterile protocols followed.

specific gravity should be performed on the fluid. During slide analysis, total nucleated
cell counts, types, and morphological assessments should be performed.
In samples with low cellularity, a portion of the collected fluid can be centrifuged to
concentrate the cellular components. After centrifugation, the sediment is examined
microscopically. The remaining, unspun sample should be saved for other methods of
analysis.

onto slide and mix into the mineral oil.
(3) Scrape the blade horizontally across the tissue.
(5) Spread the sample onto a slide, using the blade to thin the sample.
(6) Use the compression technique (see Figure 5.14) to make a smear.
This technique is also used in the diagnosis of skin mites, such as Demodex canis (see
Figure 5.11). The collection procedure is the same, but when transferring the sample
onto a slide, it is helpful to use a drop of mineral oil on the slide and mix the sample
into it. Use the blade to thin the sample (see Figure 5.10).
Tip: To aid in the collection of cells, a drop of mineral oil can be added to the blade
of thescalpelprior to scraping.
Smear preparation
Because cytological specimens vary in consistency, there are several different methods
to the thickness of the sample and the planned evaluation and staining procedure to
with them (i.e. lymph node aspirates and various centeses would need to be smeared.
Imprints from biopsies are never smeared).
Feather smear method

The line smear method is used in sample with a low cellular content. Cells are pushed
to the end of the smear and concentrated for easier evaluation.
Procedure
(1) Add a drop of sample to the slide, near the frosted end.

components.
Compression (or squash) method
The compression method is used in samples that are suspected of having cellular
tification. Care should be taken not to apply too much force to the slides during the
process, as this could cause cell rupture.
Procedure
(1) Transfer the collected sample onto a clean slide toward the frosted end of the slide.
(2) Use a second slide, perpendicular to the first (see Figure 5.14). Lay this slide on top
of the sample and allow the weight of the slide to "squash'" the sample. Do not apply

(3) Pull the spreader slide across, smearing the sample onto its underside (see
Figure 5.15).
(4) Allow the slide to air dry, then stain.
Modified squash method
Procedure
(1) Transfer the sample near the center of the slide.
(2) Add a second slide on top of the first slide, and allow the sample to squish between
the two slides. As in the compression technique, do not use any additional down-
ward force.
(3) Rotate the two slides to 45? to spread the sample (see Figure 5.16).
(4) Lift the second slide directly off of the first, and allow it to air dry before
staining.
Starfish method
The starfish method can be useful to gently spread samples onto a slide.
Procedure
(1) Add the sample to the middle of a slide.
(2) Use the tip of a smaller-gauge needle to spread the material outwards in several
directions. (see Figure 5.17)
(3) Allow the slide to air dry.

Staining
After the slide has been made, allow it to fully air dry. Avoid the use of hair dryers or
open flames to speed up the drying process, as this can cause cell distortion.
The two most common staining types are Romanowsky stains and new methylene
blue (NMB).Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
Romanowsky stains (Wright's and Diff-Quick)
Romanowsky stains will stain both the cytoplasms and nuclei of cells present in the
sufficient for the cytological determination of inflammation or neoplasia.
Regardless of the type of Romanowsky stain used, a general rule to follow is to
New methylene blue
NMB stains cytoplasms weakly, but provides excellent nuclear detail. Because of this,
NMB is useful in samples with high amounts of blood contamination. The red blood cells
do not take up much stain and therefore will not obscure the nucleated cells when
observed microscopically.
136  Veterinary Technician's Handbook of Laboratory Procedures
Wet mount technique (NMB)
(1)Add one drop of NMB stain to an air-dried cytology slide.
(2) Place a coverslip over the drop, and allow the stain to disperse. Let the stain sit for
2-5 minutes to facilitate stain uptake. This will result in easier examination of the
cells.
(3) Examine microscopically.
Tip: NMB stain should be filtered first to eliminate any stain precipitate that may
interfere with the microscopic evaluation.
Microscopic evaluation of cytology slides
The microscopic evaluation of a stained slide should begin with scanning under 10x
objective power to locate areas where cells are evenly spaced and can easily be evalu-
ated. Use 40x and 100x objective powers to identify, classify, and evaluate cell types.
Many familiar blood cell types will be present, and in addition, certain tissue cell types
will be seen (see Figure 5.18 and 5.19).
Many cells will have undergone morphological changes associated with degeneration
and disease. Pyknosis, karyolysis, and karyorrhexis should all be noted if seen.
Pyknosis and karyorrhexis
Pyknosis is associated with slow cell death (aging of a cell). Characteristics include

Inflammation
Cells seen in inflammatory cases include:
‚óèNeutrophils (see Figure 5.22)
‚óèRed cells (if hemorrhage has occurred)
‚óèEosinophils may be present
‚óè Mononuclear cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells (see
Figure 5.23)
‚óèBacteria and other microorganisms (see Figure 5.24).
The classification of the type of inflammation present can be made by the proportions
of the cell types seen. Relative differential counts should be performed and cell mor-
phology noted. Bacteria should be classified as either cocci or bacilli, and if they are
single, in pairs, or chains. Comments should also be made if the bacteria were found
extracellular or intracellular.Pay closeattentionduring the slidereview as certain
fungal organisms can be difficult to spot.

prised of a head, acrosome, midpiece, and tail. The tail can be further divided into the
principal piece and a terminal piece (see Figure 5.46).
When evaluating morphology, any abnormalities are classified as either primary
or secondary. Primary abnormalities occur during the spermatozoa cell formation
the epididymis to the collection and handling of the specimen. Secondary abnormali-
ties can occur due to rough handling of the sample, cold shock or overuse of the
sire animal. Primary abnormalities are considered more serious than the secondary
abnormalities.

Acrosomal abnormalities are important to note as they are directly related to
after the thawing process. The practice of freezing, storage, and thawing can have
an effect on the integrity of the acrosome, and therefore affecting the breeding
success rate (see Figure 5.49).
