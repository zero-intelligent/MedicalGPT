Herbal formulas are capable of targeting specific

effects primarily on the internal organs associated with

a specific Channel. The Channel that an herb specifi-
cally affects is that herb's "entering Channel" (Table
1.5). Because Gentian Long Dan Cao acts only on the

Liver and Gallbladder Channels without affecting the
other Channels, it is "entering the Liver and Gallbladder

Some herbs in a formula are able to coordinate
the other herbs' activities and direct them to a particu-

History and Comments:
1. Dang Shen was so named because it was first discov-
ered at Shang Dang in Shanxi Province and its root
looked like Ren Shen. The Shang Dang area was origi-
nally famous for its Ren Shen production, but by the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE) Ren Shen was rare
due to excessive harvesting. When the price of
Shang Dang Ren Shen skyrocketed, unethical busi-
nessmen began to pass Dang Shen off as Ren Shen.
Over decades, doctors realized Dang Shen was won-
derful for tonifying Qi, even though it did not have
Ren Shen's warming and nourishing effects. Today,
Dang Shen is used much more than Ren Shen in
Chinese medicine. Who would have expected a fake
to become the primary Chinese herb! Codonopsis
Dang Shen is a neutral Qi tonic and is good as a
general Qi Tonic.

substitute for Ginseng in most tonic formulas.

Xu diagnosed the Emperor's Mother with a Yang
Deficiency because the Qi and Blood could not flow

an Astragalus Huang Qi and Ledebouriella Fang Feng
herbal decoction were steamed underneath her bed
until the herbal steam filled the whole room like a
sauna. Mother Liu absorbed the herbs through her
nose, mouth, and skin and made a complete recov-

of the greatest Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
masters of the Jin-Yuan Dynasty, later commented
on this case that "Man's mouth is connected to the

History and Comments:
1. The City of Jiao Zuo in the Henan Province was
the home of the Kingdom of Ye in the early
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE). The Kingdom Ye
was often bullied by its neighbors. In one winter
battle, Ye's army was heavily outnumbered by the
enemy and was chased deep into the mountains.
The weather was bitterly cold, snow swirled
through the air, and the provisions had run out.
Despair began growing in the troops. Out of des-
peration, a soldier dug up some roots from a
snow-covered field and gulped them down. To
his surprise, the roots were sweet, juicy, and quite
delicious. This news was greeted with cheers as
it spread quickly through the army. The soldiers
consumed the roots for several days, and they
found their strength and vigor had returned. Many
wounded soldiers had healed. Even the horses that
had eaten the vines of the plant became much
sturdier than before. The army rushed down from
the mountain like lions, broke though the enemy's
encirclement, and recovered their lost lands. At
the celebration dinner, the soldiers named the
plant Shan (ll, "mountain") Yu (id, “encounter").
Somehow this later changed into Shao Yao because
 Yao means medicine and sounds more proper.
Today, Jiao Zuo still produces the best quality
Shan Yao in the world. This area was also famous
for its Rehmannia Sheng Di Huang, Achyranthes
Huai Niu Xi (Cyathula Chuan Niu Xi) and
Chrysanthemum Ju Hua production.
2. This herb is neutral, neither hot nor cold. It can treat
both Kidney Yin and Yang Deficiency. It can be used
long-term, often in foods as well as teas, powders,
and pills. It is often used in Spleen tonics with
Atractylodes Bai Zhu and Ginseng Ren Shen and in
 Kidney tonics with Poria Fu Ling.
h
 3. Shan Yao has been very effective for neonatal diar-
rhea and has successfully treated ulcers in the
gums and mouth. Shan Yao also improves the
 digestive system, promotes urination, lowers blood
sugar, lowers blood pressure, and has antiaging
effects.

not always associated with anemia, but they may arise
from a variety of problems, including emotional stress,
Kidney Deficiency (renal failure), Spleen Qi Deficiency,
hemorrhage (trauma, parturition), heart failure, and
chronic hepatitis. The Liver and Heart are most affected
by Blood Deficiency (Table 1.3). Liver Blood Deficiency
may cause poor growth of toenails/hooves or tendons/
ligaments, dry paws/hooves, poor vision and seeing
spots (fly-biting seizure activity), or Internal Wind
(seizure activity). Animals with Heart Blood Deficiency
often present with palpitations, insomnia (behavior
issues at night), fatigue, anxiety, and nervousness.
A few Blood tonic herbs can directly stimulate
red Blood cell production; however, most work by
strengthening the body and improving nutrition, indi-
rectly increasing the number of circulating Blood
cells.9
The close relationship between Qi and Blood is rep-
 and "Blood is the mother of Qi." In health, Qi generates
Blood and causes it to circulate while Blood is the
vehicle transporting Qi to the whole body. In disease,
 deficient Qi fails to move and generate Blood, leading
to Blood Deficiency and Blood Stagnation. For this
reason, a Blood Deficiency Pattern may be treated with
Blood tonic formulas, which include Qi tonic herbs.
Blood tonic formulas may also contain Yin tonic herbs,
because nourishing Yin and Body Fluid can also rein-
force Blood.
Herbs to tonify Blood are rich and excessively sweet.
Long-term use or overdosage can easily cause Stagnation
and Spleen Qi Deficiency. These herbs may have side
 effects such as indigestion, poor appetite, diarrhea, and
 epigastric distension. Thus, herbs to move Qi-Blood and
strengthen the Spleen are often added to counteract
these effects.

Ji arrived home, he saw his wife was dying. Ji
immediately prepared Dang Gui soup and fed it
to his wife. Upon drinking, her eyes brightened
and she soon recovered. The couple cultivated
many acres of Dang Gui and generously shared
the herb. Ever since, Dang Gui has grown along
the Wei River, and its sweet fragrance can be
smelled many miles away every summer.
2. Different portions of the herb have differing thera-
peutic properties. The root tails (Angelica Dang Gui
Wei) are better for moving Blood, but they are pro-
hibited during pregnancy. The root head (Angelica
Dang Gui Tou) is used for nourishing Blood. The
whole root (Angelica Quan Dang Gui) is most com-
 monly used for both invigorating and nourishing
Blood.
 3. Soaking the herb in wine enhances the herb's invig-
orating function. Frying the herb in vinegar enhances
its ability to move Blood. Toasting the herb into ash
 increases its ability to warm the channels and stop
bleeding.
4. Angelica Dang Gui is best combined with Astragalus
Huang Qi to build Blood.
5. Dang Gui causes an increase in uterine contractions.
This may be the mechanism underlying its effective-
ness in treating uterine retention. The herb does not
appear to have any estrogenic effect.

History and Comments:
1. The first story about Mai Men Dong includes Qin Shi
Huang, the first emperor who united China during
Qin Dynasty (221 to 209 BCE). One day, a small
bird carrying a plant in its beak flew into the palace
and dropped the herb right onto Emperor Qin's
desk. The elegant herb had beautiful lavender
flowers and long, narrow green leaves. The emperor
asked Gui Gu Zi about the herb. Gui Gu Zi, a
famous military tactician and sly diplomat, answered
carefully: "This is the herb of immortality from the
Ying Island of the East Sea. When a person dies,
cover him with this herb on the third day, and he
will come back to life immediately. One herb can
revive one person." Because the Emperor Qin
believed Gui Gu Zi, he sent his emissary Xu Fu
along with three thousand virgin boys and three
thousand virgin girls to the East Sea to search for
the herb of immortality. They finally found and
brought this plant back to the emperor.
 2. Although Mai Men Dongcannot bring a dead emperor
to life, it is able to moisten the Metal (Lung) and
purify the Water (Kidney). When Mai Men Dong is
combined with Ren Shen and Wu Wei Zi, it forms the
Original Reference: Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing (Shen Nong's

History and Comments:
1. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), a goat
farmer owned 1 buck and 15 does that had not
produced offspring for many years. Annoyed by
this situation, the farmer asked a wise man for
advice. The wise man suggested that the farmer
feed an herb called Xian Ling Pi to his goats. The
farmer fed the herb to the goats and was pleased
when the animals began to breed. However, his
enthusiasm waned a little when the animals' libido
responded too positively. The male goat became
So lustful that he mated with the female goats
relentlessly day and night hundreds of times. Thus,
he had to discontinue the herbal medication to
balance the buck's libido. Upon hearing the news,
other farmers also began feeding Xian Ling Pi, in
smaller amounts, to encourage their goats to mate.
 The farmers changed the herb's name to Yin Yang
Huo because its leaves looked like Huo (ageratum)
and it could stimulate Yin (libido) in the Yang

Liang sent Zhang Yi to his task with a final warning
that "Anyone who fails to execute the plan will be

Yi was afraid that he and his subordinates would all
be killed. Attempting to avert mortal punishment,
he wrote a report explaining the reason for the
failure. He explained that a 3-day storm cut off pro-
visions from the troops waiting in ambush in the
valley. The cold and hungry soldiers ate the roots of
the nearby grasses. One herb (Ba Ji Tian) with a
white and purple root, tender texture, fleshy appear-
ance, and a sweet, slightly spicy taste was particu-
larly popular among the men. It deterred hunger
and kept them warm, so everyone enjoyed eating it.
However, after eating the herb for several days, all
the soldiers suffered from an embarrassing ailment.
Every man had a long-lasting erection he could
hardly bear, and he could not stop groaning. The
groaning sound from the one thousand soldiers
reverberated in the valley like a roaring wind, which

treatments. One day, a boy was rushed in for emer-
gency treatment. Several other doctors' initial
attempts at treatment had been unsuccessful. When
Wenfu took the case, he heard that the boy's father
disapproved of high dosage treatments and that he
always reduced a high-dose prescription in half
without the doctor's knowledge. Wenfu told the
father to boil 24g Ma Huang and have the boy drink
it until he sweated. The boy completely recovered
with just one dose of Ma Huang herb soup. When
father and son returned the next day for a checkup.
Wenfu asked the father, "How much did you reduce
the Ma Huang dose?" Surprised, the boy's father
answered, "Half, but how did you know about it?"
Wenfu replied, "I knew you would reduce it, that's
why I doubled the dose.
3. Use raw Ephedra Ma Huang for Exterior disorders,
 but fry Ephedra Ma Huang to reduce its dispersing
effect. Honey-frying the herb increases the moisten-
ing effects in the Lungs and is better for asthma and
cough.
4. Ma Huang contains ephedrine alkaloids, which can
raise the heart rate and blood pressure and can cause
stroke, heart attack, or death. As a result, the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned
dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids
in April 2004.

2. Fang means defense and Feng means wind. The
 name Fang Feng originates from a folk story. Once
upon a time, Mang Shan, the most beautiful moun-
tain in central China, concealed many hidden trea-
sures. One day, a greedy monster, who dwelled in
the South China Sea, heard about the treasures in
the mountain. He desired to own the entire moun-
tain. In an attempt to transport the mountain, he
called forth his most powerful witchcraft. Suddenly
dark clouds moved across the sky, blocking out the
sun. Strong winds filled the air with sand, stones
shot through the sky like arrows, but the mountain

1. Long ago in China, a man fell in love with a native
 girl and wanted to marry her. Parents on both sides
disapproved of the marriage. The lovers ran away
together to live in the wild mountains. One day the
man fell ill. His whole body was covered with a
rash, his face was dark red, and he was unconscious.
His beloved girlfriend felt powerless as she watched
her lover dying, and she began to cry. A monk
passing by heard her sobbing and investigated the
situation. The monk handed the woman a stick,
which was white on the inside and purple on the
outside. The monk said, "This is Ge Gen. Make juice
out of it, feed it to your man, and he shall live."
The woman followed these instructions and the
man recovered quickly after drinking the Ge Gen
juice. The couple continued using Ge Gen as a
supplement and they lived a long and happy life

Pharmacological studies indicate that these herbs
herbs to transform Cold-Phlegm, 2) herbs to transform
 may have the following effects: 1) eliminating sputum
Heat-Phlegm, and 3) herbs to relieve cough and
by increasing respiratory tract secretions and demon-
asthma. Even though they are in different categories,
strating strong expectorant effects, 2) antitussive effects
all of these herbs are related to Phlegm. So, what is

Deficiency. Diseases due to Phlegm include a variety
of syndromes depending upon the body region
affected. Phlegm may appear in the Lung, Stomach,
Heart, or the Meridians and Channels (Table 3.1).
Retention of Phlegm in the Lung, for instance, may
lead to cough and asthma. Obstructed Phlegm in the
Meridians may give rise to subcutaneous nodules or
suppurative inflammation of deep tissues. Phlegm
afflicting the Heart may cause Shen disturbance,
Internal Wind (Seizure or convulsions), loss of con-
sciousness or coma.
 Phlegm accumulation may be caused by exogenous
Heat or Cold; thus, there are two forms of Phlegm: Heat
Phlegm and Cold Phlegm. Cold Phlegm is also called
Damp Phlegm because it is often associated with Damp.
Herbs to treat Phlegm are divided into three categories
based on which form of Phlegm or symptoms they
treat: 1) herbs to transform Cold-Phlegm, 2) herbs to
transform Heat-Phlegm (Table 3.2), and 3) herbs to
relieve cough and asthma, which focus on treating
Phlegm-related symptoms, such as the five Patterns in
Table 3.3. As necessary, combine these three categories
 of herbs with the following: 1) Wind-dispersing herbs,
2) Qi tonics, 3) herbs to dispel endogenous Wind or to
calm Shen, 4) herbs to soften hardness, and 5) herbs to
dispel Cold and remove stagnation, especially for Yin
carbuncles.

his symptoms only worsened. One day, Yang's son
heard that the famous royal doctor was in town, so
he asked the royal doctor for help. The doctor
examined Yang and stated his diagnosis, “"Your
father has a mysterious disease. If he wants to live,
your father must eat one pound of Sheng Jiang
(Fresh Ginger) soon. Considering his extreme sore
throat, Yang was skeptical about the prescription,
but he followed the doctor's instructions. Oddly
enough, he did not feel the Ginger's pungency
while eating, and quickly consumed half a pound
of Ginger. Yang immediately felt relief from
the
pain and swelling. After a short while, he felt the
pungency of the Ginger, so he began to eat and
drink his usual foods. The next day, Yang visited
the royal doctor to thank him for saving his life.
Yang asked the doctor about the miracle cure, and
the doctor told him, "While traveling in the south,
you must have eaten many partridges which like to
eat Ban Xia. The toxin of Ban Xia infused the par-
tridge flesh, and these toxins transferred to your
body when you ate the bird. Over time, the accu-
mulated toxin caused the throat swelling. Shen
Nong Ben Cao Jing states that Fresh Ginger can
detoxify the Ban Xia's toxin. That's why I prescribed
ShengJiang."

History and Comments
1. During the three-kingdom days (AD 221-263),
Dong Fong lived on a mountain called Lu Shan.
This doctor had an illustrious reputation and used
his superior medical skills to treat patients at no
charge. Rather than accepting payment, Dong Fong
 let his appreciative patients plant a Xing (apricot)
tree around his house instead. After several years,
there were more than ten thousand apricot trees
around the doctor's house, and the area was known
as Dong Xian Xing Ling (Dr. Dong's Apricot Forest).
When the apricots matured, Dr. Dong traded these
fruits for rice to help poor people and also kept
the seeds of apricots to treat cough or asthma
patients without any payment. Since this time,
doctors who perform meritoriously are awarded the
    ,  p
their excellent work.
One day a tiger came to Dr. Dong's house to ask
for help. Dr. Dong carefully examined the tiger. He
found a fish bone stuck in the tiger's throat and he
risked his life to remove the fish bone. In return for
Dr. Dong's help, the tiger became Dr. Dong's
rest of his life. Today one can usually find a scroll

Heat Patterns are then further divided into Exterior

such as nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat,
fever with aversion to cold, and superficial (floating)
pulse. Herbs to release Exterior Heat, including Mentha

History and Comments:
1. Long ago in ancient China, the mountain named
Tian Ling Shan was covered with many trees and
surrounded by thick mist. An industrious and kind-
hearted child lived at the base of Tian Ling Shan.
He would chop wood in the mountain forests.
When he was 14 years old, his parents died. The
boy did not have money to buy a coffin, so he had
to bury his parents in a nearby mountain cave. For
3 years he mourned for his parents. One day,
during his visit to his parents' grave, the young
man suffered from a toothache and swollen gums.
He saw white light deeper in the cave. The young
man followed the light and found a long white
mass, which he tasted. The mass was tasty, so he
cut it into many small pieces and ate it happily.
Surprisingly, the pain in his teeth and gums sub-
sided. The young man called this mass Shi Gao
(rocky cream) and used it for the treatment of
stomatitis and gingivitis.
2. When published in 1918, Zhang Xi Chun's herbal
book Yi Xue Zhong Zhong Can Xi Lu (Records of Heart-
felt Experiences in Medicine with Reference to the West)
documented using Shi Gao in combination with
aspirin. Since its introduction to the market in 1899
under the trademark Aspirin?, acetylsalicylic acid
has attained a leading position worldwide as an

HERBS TO CLEAR HEAT AND COOL BLOOD
Because herbs to clear Heat and cool Blood are often
used to treat Blood Heat, they are also called Herbs to
Clear Blood Heat. Pathogenic Heat may affect the body
at four levels (stages): Wei, Qi, Ying, and Xue (Blood).
When pathogenic Heat initially invades the body, it
lodges in the surface and is considered Heat in the Wei
Level (Exterior Heat, or Wind Heat). The Heat then
 migrates into the deep level, Qi Stage, which is related
to Lung Heat and Yang-ming Heat (including Stomach
and Large Intestine Heat). The deepest level for Heat to
penetrate is the Xue (Blood) stage, where it is often
called Blood Heat.
The primary clinical signs of Blood Heat include 1)
bleeding [nose, gums, Stomach, intestines, or under
the skin]; 2) purple, deep red, or dark tongue; 3) skin
h
rashes; 4) vomiting or coughing up Blood; 5) bloody
feces or urine; and 5) rapid and thin pulse. Additional
signs may include nighttime or low-grade fevers and

History and Comments
1. Over a thousand years ago, a woman named Liu
Chun was a well-known weaver of silk fabric. She
could create flowers and birds that looked almost
real. A rich landlord, who was preparing for his
daughter's marriage, requested that Liu Chun weave
 24 natural silk quilt blocks inlayed with Moutan
flowers. Liu Chun had never seen this flower and did
not know how to weave its image into the fabric.
Half a month elapsed and Liu Chun still had not
woven any flowers. She was so worried that she
stopped eating and gradually became emaciated.
Working late one night, she became faint and fell
down on the loom. At midnight, a red creature
shaped like a boy flew to her and poured a bottle of
medicinal liquor into Liu Chun's mouth. Liu Chun
woke up immediately. The boy told her that he was
the moutan fairy. He then gestured outside the
window where there were many moutan flowers in
full bloom in the court. Staring at the flowers, Liu
Chun began to weave. Shortly, Liu Chun wove the
moutan flower Pattern into the 24 quilt blocks. As
soon as she completed her weaving, all the flowers
withered and disappeared; only the moutan root
bark remained. This bark was later discovered to be
a medicine to cool Blood and clear Heat. Since the
red boy led to this discovery, the people called this
medicine Mu (male) Dan (red) Pi (bark).
2. Use raw Mu Dan Pi for Blood Heat. Stir-bake it for
Blood Stagnation. Use the carbonized herb to stop
bleeding
 3. Moutan Mu Dan Pi is a principle herb in treating
gynecological problems associated with Blood
Stasis.

4. Moutan Mu Dan Pi has antibacterial and antiallergic
effect, and also is useful for high blood pressure.

Considerations When Using Purgative Herbs:
Rheum Da Huang 大黄
1. When Interior Pattern occurs along with Exterior
Pattern in a patient, two methods may be used for
treatment. One method is to combine purgative
herbs with herbs to release Exterior Patterns. The
alternative method is to first use the herbs to treat
the Exterior Pattern and then use the herbs to treat
the Interior Pattern.
2. If a patient's body resistance (antipathological factor)
is weak, combine the purgative herbs with tonic
herbs.
 3. Purgative herbs should be used cautiously in patients
who are weak due to chronic diseases during preg-
nancy, or postpartum.
4. Many purgative herbs are powerful agents for induc-
ing diarrhea. These herbs should not be used when
normal bowel movements have been restored.
HERBS TO DRAIN THE FECES DOWNWARD
Herbs in this category are bitter and cold. They facili
tate the expulsion of stool by stimulating or lubricating
the intestines. These herbs can remove wastes such as
toxins, stasis, parasites, or retained water. Some can

attraction to warm water, diarrhea, clear and prolonged
urination, pale tongue with a white, thin coating, and
deep, slow pulse. Two common Interior Cold Patterns
include Spleen Cold and Yang Deficiency (Table 6.1).
The pungent or acrid herbs to warm the Interior are
warmer and stronger than the sweet Yang tonic herbs.
Interior warming herbs are associated with the Spleen,
 Kidney, Heart, Liver, and Lung Channels. These herbs
act to warm the Interior, expel Cold, warm the chan-
nels to stop pain, build up Fire, and assist Yang Qi. Thus,
Herbs to warm the Interior treat Cold in the Middle
Burner (Spleen and Stomach), pain due to Interior
Cold, Spleen Yang Deficiency, and Kidney Yang
Deficiency. Practitioners may combine these herbs with
others depending on the patient's condition. Combine
Herbs to warm the Interior with 1) herbs to relieve the
Exterior for Exterior Patterns, 2) Qi-invigorating herbs
for Qi Stagnation due to Cold, 3) herbs to resolve Spleen
Damp for Spleen Damp due to Cold accumulation, 4)
Spleen or Kidney tonics for Spleen or Kidney Deficiency,
and 5) herbs to tonify source Qi for Yang collapse. These
herbs are contraindicated for Heat Patterns and Yin

 nature. Because they are acrid, dry, and warming, these
herbs can easily injure Body Fluids. Use these herbs very
cautiously during pregnancy.
Biomedical research indicates that the herbs in this
category are cardiotonics that reflexively stimulate
the vasoactive centers of the central nervous system,
thereby stimulating Blood flow. Some of these herbs are

Herbs toDispel Damp祛湿药
Huisheng Xie, Min Su Kim, Cheryl Chrisman
Damp, which is one of Six Pathogenic Qi, is character-
Angelica Du Huo 独活
ized as a thick, heavy, greasy, sticky, mucoid pathogen.
Damp can be divided into Interior Damp, which is
generated from the internal organs, and Exterior Damp,
which enters from the external environment. External
 Damp combines with pathogenic Wind, Cold, Summer
Heat and Heat, when it invades the body. Therefore,
the pathogens related to Damp include Wind-Damp.
Cold-Damp, and Damp-Heat.

Damp. These herbs are divided into three categories: 1)
Herbs to Dispel Wind-Damp, 2) Aromatic Herbs to
Transform Damp, and 3) Herbs to Benefit Urination
 and Drain Damp.
HERBS TO DISPEL WIND-DAMP
Herbs to dispel Wind-Damp are often used to treat Bi
Syndrome. Bi Syndrome refers to Qi-Blood Stagnation
in the muscles, sinews, joints, bones, and Channels.
There are four types of Bi Syndrome (Table 7.1).
 Herbs to dispel Wind-Damp can relieve pain; relax
tendons; promote Qi circulation in Channels; and
strengthen tendons, joints, and bones. These herbs
have analgesic, antinflammatory, and antipyretic
effects, and promote circulation. They are indicated for
the following conditions: soft tissue pain, muscle
spasms, muscle numbness, hemiplegia, degenerative 
joint diseases, arthritis, soreness, and pain and weak-
ness in the back and limbs.
Because alcohol can enhance the herbs' ability to
expel Wind-Damp, herbs are commonly used as tinc-
tures or in other prepared forms. The herbs are gen-
 erally aromatic and warm, which makes them drying
in nature. Because this drying effect may injure the
Yin and Blood, these herbs are contraindicated for
 Blood or Yin Deficiency. Herbs to dispel Wind-Damp
may be combined with Wind dispersing herbs, Qi
and Blood invigorating herbs, or warming or cooling
Herbs.

AROMATIC HERBS TO TRANSFORM DAMP
 Herbs to transform Damp are warm, aromatic, fragrant,
pungent, and drying. They can expel the pathogenic
Damp, which stagnates in the Middle Burner (Zhong
Jiao), mainly the Spleen and Stomach. The primary
clinical signs include bloated abdomen (or abdominal
 distension), vomiting, nausea, acid regurgitation, poor
appetite, lack of thirst, diarrhea, lassitude, a pale or
yellow tongue with white and greasy coating, and a
slippery pulse or soft pulse.
According to an old TCVM saying the "Spleen dis-
 likes Damp but enjoys fragrance." Excessive Damp stag-
nates in the Middle Burner (Zhong Jiao) and limits the
Spleen's ability to transform and transport water and
Body Fluids, which allows Damp to build up. On the
other hand, fragrant herbs can revive the Spleen's
ability to transform and transport Damp, which subse-
quently decreases the Damp. Thus, these aromatic
herbs combat Damp by strengthening the Spleen,
transforming turbid Damp, and promoting Qi flow in
the Spleen and Stomach. The herbs can treat Damp due
to Spleen Qi or Yang Deficiency, Summer Damp-Heat,
Damp Bi Syndromes, and diarrhea. They are often com-
bined with other herbs to treat specific conditions. For
example, combine aromatic herbs with 1) herbs to
warm the Interior for Cold-Damp conditions, 2) herbs
to clear Heat for Damp-Heat conditions, 3) herbs to
invigorate Qi flow for Damp Stagnation, or 4) herbs to
tonify Spleen Qi for Damp due to Spleen Qi Deficiency.

Herbs to Regulate
(Stagnant)Qi理气药
Huisheng Xie, Cheryl Chrisman, Min Su Kim
Qi is the most essential substance for forming an
regulate Qi primarily act to optimize the physiological
animal's body and maintaining its life activities. When
functions of the gastrointestinal tract and Liver.
the body is functioning properly, the Qi flows smoothly
and freely. This Qi flow is known as Qi Ji. Distur-
Citrus Chen Pi 陈皮
bances of Qi flow result in disease. Qi flow disorders
occur in one of two forms: Stagnation (blockage) or
rebellion.
Qi Stagnation in the Exterior, which includes the
Channels, muscles, joints, and connective tissues, leads
to pain (Bi Syndrome). Qi Stagnation in the blood cir-
culation leads to Blood Stagnation. Qi Stagnation in the
Interior can lead to internal organ dysfunction. There
are three primary categories of Internal Qi Stagnation:
Stomach Qi Stagnation, Liver Qi Stagnation, and Lung
Qi Stagnation (Table 8.1).
The herbs to regulate Qi support Qi functions by
promoting free Qi flow and eliminating Qi Stagnation
or rebellious Qi. These herbs are mostly warm, aro-
matic, drying, invigorating, pungent, or bitter in
nature. They are used to treat gastrointestinal disor-
ders, asthma, and emotional and behavioral disorders.
Because these herbs are drying, prolonged use can
 damage stomach Yin. Their pungent and invigorating
qualities can scatter and disperse Qi. Thus, use them
cautiously in patients with Qi Deficiency. During prep-
aration, cook the herbs for only a short time (15
minutes) to preserve their aromatic aspects and rich
volatile oils.
To understand Qi from a modern biomedical per-
spective, one can imagine Qi as the physiological activi-
ties of the tissues. Qi Stagnation is an impediment or
malfunction in the activity of the tissues. Herbs that

History and Comments:
1. Auratium Zhi Shi is excellent for treating nausea. It
is also effective for breaking up Phlegm and descend-
ing Stomach Qi.
2. Aurantium Zhi Shi is the immature fruit. The mature
fruit is called Aurantium Zhi Ke or Aurantium Zhi
Qiao. Although their properties are slightly different,
one can be substituted for the other.
3. Aurantium Zhi Ke is milder than Aurantium Zhi Shi
and thus is preferred for chronic or less serious dis-
eases. Aurantium Zhi Ke has a more ascending direc-
tion, and Aurantium Zhi Shi has a more descending
direction. If there is constipation, Aurantium Zhi Shi
is more appropriate.
4. Auratium Zhi Shi is used especially when the formula
contains purgative and diuretic therapies. It is com-
bined with Citrus Chen Pi to strengthen the Middle
Burner (Zhong Jiao).

Herbs to Stop Bleeding
止血药
Huisheng Xie, Min Su Kim, Cheryl Chrisman
Herbs to stop bleeding are used to stop many types
Sanguisorba Di Yu 地榆
  o      o
bleeding, hematemesis, epistaxis (nosebleed), hemop-
tysis (coughing up blood), hematochezia (blood
in feces), hematuria (blood in urine), uterine bleed-
ing, and bleeding from gastrointestinal ulcers. The
energy of these herbs goes to the Blood Level (Xue
stage). Herbs to stop bleeding are associated with Liver,
Heart, and Spleen because the Liver stores Blood, the
 Heart governs Blood, and the Spleen holds Blood inside
the blood vessels. In addition to hemostasis, some of
these herbs cool Blood Heat, invigorate the Blood to
stop Blood Stasis, warm the Channels, or are
astringents.
Bleeding can be caused by systemic Heat, Blood
Heat, Liver Yang Rising, False Heat due to Yin Deficiency.
a  s  a o s
Bleeding then leads to other secondary conditions,
including Blood Stagnation. The herbs to stop bleeding
are for symptomatic treatment only. They stop the
hemorrhage, but they do not treat the underlying
"root" cause of the hemorrhage. Therefore, these herbs
should be combined with other herbs to treat the
 patient's underlying condition. Herbs to stop bleeding
are combined with herbs that 1) dispel systemic Heat,
2) cool Blood Heat, 3) subdue the Liver Yang, 4) nourish
the Yin, 5) tonify Spleen Qi, 6) tonify Yang Qi to prevent
collapse, or 7) invigorate Blood.

Herbs to Open Orifices
(Senses）开窍药
Huisheng Xie, Vanessa Preast, Min Su Kim
The herbs in this chapter treat Bi Zheng (Closed
Bovis Calculus Niu Huang 牛黄
 Syndrome or Unconsciousness Syndrome) by opening
the orifices and senses (Table 15.l). The orifices are
called Qiao in Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine
(TCVM). Qiao organs include the nose, ears, brain, eyes,
and skin. When Qiao organs are open, the body has 
normal senses and perception. When Qiao organs are
closed, Bi Zheng results and the animal loses conscious-
ness. In general, the herbs to open the orifices are
strongly aromatic, which has a remarkable ability to
stimulate sense organs, restore consciousness, stimulate
the central nervous system and revive patients in a
coma. Some herbs have a tranquilizing effect, which
can treat irritability and stop spasms. These herbs treat
the clinical signs of a disease rather than the underlying
root cause of the illness. Because cooking or boiling can
destroy their effectiveness, most of these herbs are
administered in powder or pill form.
These herbs are used only as an immediate therapy
for emergency conditions and for a short period of
time. Additionally, some of these herbs are contraindi-
cated during pregnancy. Because of the potency and
penetration of these herbs, Yuan (Source) Qi con-
sumption may occur with overdoses or long-term

Herbs to Expel Parasites
驱虫药
Huisheng Xie, Min Su Kim, Cheryl Chrisman
Because there is a variety of parasites, different
Dryopteris Guan Zhong 贯众
 methods are available to expel them. In general, con-
ventional pharmaceutical drugs that kill parasites are
more effective and expedient, but the herbs discussed
in this chapter can also be useful to expel intestinal
parasites, including roundworms, hookworms, tape-
worms, and pinworms. These herbs often have a bitter
taste and most enter the Spleen, Stomach, and Large
Intestine Channels; some, however, also enter the
Lung Channels.
Herbs to expel parasites are often combined with
other herbs, and the ones selected will vary with the
underlying disease Pattern. For Cold Patterns, either
 Zanthoxylum Chuan Jiao or Dry Ginger Zingiberis Gan
Jiang is added to formulas. For Heat Patterns, either
Coptis Huang Lian or Phellodendron Huang Bai is added.
 For Food Stagnation, herbs such as Crataegus Shan Zha
and Massa Fermentata Shen Qu are added.
When using herbs to expel parasites, the following
should be considered: 1) oily foods should be avoided
 and the herbs should be administered on an empty
stomach; 2) some antiparasitic herbs including Melia
Ku Lian Pi are toxic, and overdosing can cause side
effects; 3) some herbs, such as Omphalia Lei Wan,
should be used with caution during pregnancy or for
patients with weak constitutions; and 4) herbs to
strengthen the Spleen and Stomach should be used for
 patients with Spleen Qi Deficiency prior to or while
taking herbs that expel parasites.
