In memory of Charles Leblois,
Clinical director of theNationalVeterinarySchool,Alfort,
who in the1920s,was thefirst to propose a diagnostic approach in animal dermatology.
thatwas based on history taking,clinical examination,differential diagnosis and
performing suitablediagnostictests.

EricGuaguere
Skindiseasescaused bymitesandinsects areofprimeimportanceinfelinedermatologyandenter

others are less so because the signs associated with thcn arcnon-spceifie.Some cctoparasitic
conditions may be the source of human infestations,unrecognised by either the vet or the
cheyletiellosis,trombiculiasis,demodicosis,pediculosisand flea infestation.Methodsof flea
control,both mechanical and chemical, are described.
4Dermatophytosis
KarenA.Moriello-Douglas J.DeBoer
Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal infection of the skin.Microsporum canis,the most
isolation warrants special attention.As dermatophytosis is an inportant zoonosis,it isvcry
transmilled by dircct contact involving aninfected cat or indirccilyviaa contaminacd
environment.Clinical signs arevery pleomorphic and dermatophytosis should be considered in
the differential diagnosis ofall feline skin conditions.Fungal cultureis stillconsidered thegold

environment.Systemic antifungal treatment is the treatment of choice.Clipping promotes faster
healing andis recommended forlong-haired cats and catswith severe infections.Topical therapy
limits transmission and the spread of sporesin the environment.Itneeds tobecontinued until
fungal cultures are negative on two or three successive occasions in all animals examined.A
contaminated environment is often an important reservoir of spores.Environmental
decontaminationrequiresrepeated cleaning to eliminate organicdebris andfrequent application
of an antifungal disinfectant.Vaccination is not currently an effective means of preventing
dermatophytosis.

organs and the skin(systemicmycoses）.Theyarecaused by saprophytic fungi thatnormally live
in the soil, vegetation and decomposing organic matter. Most are considered opportunistic
pathogens.Dermatological signsarecharacterisedbynodules,fistulaeand ulcerson theventrum,
distal limbs and/or the face.In systemic mycoses,various systemic signs （respiratory,
neurological,ocularbony)are observed.Diagnosisisbased oncytologyorhistopathology o

Immunological techniques can sometimes be used in the diagnosis of systemic mycoses.
Treatment ofdeep mycoses is difficult anddefinitive cureisrarely possible.

However, some specifie bacterial infections, possibly secondary to a systemic illness (e.g.

the cat flea.Practical, effective methods of flea control are prcsented.
9Flea allergy dermatitis
Flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) is the most common pruritic dermatosis in the cat. A diagnosis of
FAD cannot be eliminated by the absence of fleas or flea faeces becauseallergiccatscanremove
fleas from their coat by grooming.FAD should be suspected when self-induced,principally
dorsolumbar,alopecia,miliary dermatitis or,more rarely, eosinophilic plaques or linear
granulomas are present.Allergy testing has little diagnostic value.Treatment initially involves
rigorous flea control for the affected cat,in-contact animals and the environmcnt. When
antipruritic treatment isnecessary,theuse ofcorticosteroidsproducesimmediateimprovement.

E.Guaguere
Food intolerance should be considered a possible cause ofnon-seasonal pruritus in the cat,
especiallyforself-inducedlesionsof thefaceandneck,andwhenlesionsare accompanied by
gastrointestinalproblems.Diagnosis isbasedonresponse toanelimination dietfedover at least
10weeks.Thedietmust contain novel sources ofprotein and shouldonly beformulated after

13Auto-immunedermatoses
T.Willemse
Auto-immune dermatoses arerare.They are characterisedimmunologically by the deposition of
auto-antibodies at various levelsof the epidermis(pemphigus）and basement membrane (bullus
penphigoid),or inmune complexes within the basement membrane (lupus erythematosus）.
Knowledge of these diseases is important as they enterinto the differential diagnosis of many
differentconditionsThepemphiguscomplex consists of several forms:pemphigusvulgaris(PV)
[cmphigus foliaceus (PF) and pemphigus erythematosus (PE).Bullous pemphigoid (BP)has just
recently been identified in the cat. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and systemic lupus
crylhcmatosus (SLE) are encountered only exceptionally. Diagnosis is based on the history,
clinicalexamination,and histopathology.For SLE,other procedures such as haematology and
antinuclear antibody testing,must be carriedout.The prognosis for auto-immune disorders is
variable,relatively goodforPF,PEandDLE,guarded forPPand SLEreatent involv
mainlyoral corticosteroids at immunosuppressive doses and possibly certain alkylating agents
(chlorambucyl) and gold salts (aurothioglucose).

Tumours of the skin andits adnexae aresome of themost diverse and common tumours seen in
thc cat. Such a large variety is possible because the skin is made up of lots of diffcrcnt

which involve themalpighian layer,theadnexal sebaceous or sweat glands and hairfollicles,
lumours of the melanogenesis system,mesenchymal tumours developing in thc dermis or

Z.Alhaidari
The diagnostic approach tofeline pruritic dermatoses must bemethodical and should include
certain fundamental diagnostic steps:a detailed history,thorough clinical examination,and

performedroutinely.given the incidence of ectoparasitic infestation and dermatophytosis in the
cat.Differential allergy diagnosisis based on avoidance measures (e.g.flea control and restricted
diet) as allergy testing remains unreliable in this species. Skin biopsies are indicated when the

Hair growth consists of different phascs:a growth (anagen）phase (Fig.1:7),an intermediate (catagen)
phase (Fig. 1.8) and a resting (telogen) phase.Duration of the anagen phase depends on brccd and region
of skin.Long-haired cats have a longer anagen phase than short-haired cats.Dorsal hair has a longcr

Protection from light
The coat is an excellent barrier to visible light and ulra-violet (UV) rays. In the areas where the coat is
sparseorabsent,pigments(mainlymelanins),keratin,roteins andlood absorb therays andpreven
certain skinlesions.Neverthelessinwhiteorlight-coatedcatswithlittleigment,solarkeratoticlesions
and epidermal carcinomas can appear in sparsely-haired areas such as the pinnae,nose,eyelids and thc
Thermoregulation
Temperature regulationis also animportant function of the coat and skin.The thick coal and the layer of
subcutaneous connective tissue,richin adiposecells,protect the catwhen the temperatureis cold.An
insulating air cushion exists between the hairs. The size of the air cushion can be increased or decreased
by the action of arrectormuscles.The undercoat is shed in the spring and re-grows in the autumn in breds
whichexperiencelargeseasonal temperaturevariations.Thisisparticularly truein theTurkishVan breed,
originating in central Anatolia,where the temperature variation between summer and winter can be as
much as 50°C. The highly developed dermal vascular system plays an important role in therrmoregulation.
Vasodilatationproducesheat loss andvasoconstriction causes closure of arteriovenous shunts,which
prcvcnts cxcessive heat loss from the circulation.The cutaneous vascular system stores largequantities of
blood andperipheralvasodilatationorvasoconstrictioncanalsohave aneffectoncentral bloodlpressure
Cats have aparticularway ofreducing theirbody temperature as,unlike inhumans,sweat glandsarenot
involved in thermoregulation.Cats constantly wet their coats by licking.This produces a cooling effect
as saliva evaporates from the skin surface.
Biochemical homeostasis
Many substances are stored in the dermis and subcutaneous connective tissue.Largequantities ofwater
andelectrolytes are associatedwith proteoglycans and other molecules in the ground substance,while
lipids and fat-soluble molecules are stored in subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Horny layer
The compact hoy layerrpresents the first physical bare to infectios and parasitic infestations. In
normalconditions,watcr,watcr-solublc molccules andmicro-organisms cannot cross it.Constant
shedding of themost superficial cells reduces excessive bacterial colonisation which could otherwise
predispose to infection.

glycosphingolipids arising from the decomposition of the hony layer might play an even greater
antibacterial role.Specificfactors,suchascomplemcnt and immunoglobulins,can attach themselvesto

The resident surfaceflora,which occupies micro-ecological niches.prevents colonisation by pathogenic
micro-organisms byproducing antibiotics,cnzymcs or other toxic substances.They utilise available

instructed,and clinicalresponse obtained.If a cutaneous drugreaction is suspected,all treatments
should immediately be stopped and the cause investigated.
Clinical examination
General examination
A systematic general examination should be conducted.Mcthodical cxamination of the different
signs:for example,respiratory signs associated with atopic dermatiisherpesvirus infction,
herpesvirus-associated erythema multiforme or digital mctastasis of apulmonary adenocarcinoma;
gastrointestinal signsassociatedwithfoodintolerancejointorrenalsignsassociatdwithsystemic
lupus erythematosus;diabetes mellitus seenfrequently with hyperadrenocorticism or the whole
gamut of signs linked to cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromcs (e.g.pancreatic paraneoplastic alopecia
and paraneoplastic exfoliative dermatitis).In some cases,testing should be carricd out for
retroviruses.
Dermatological examination
Identificationoflesions
Dermatological diagnosis depends on the morphological identification of lesions Mis. The
dermatologist must identify and investigate primary and secondary lesions.Primary lesions
make up the carly lesions,representative of the dermatosis.They are sometimes transient and
rapidly altered.Secondary lesions may develop spontaneously from primary lesions.They may
also arise as a consequence of scratching and licking,especially common in the cat,or
following treatment.Theidentification andinterpretation of these lesionsismore difficult than
in the dog.This is due to the densc coat of the cat and also bccause cats lick themselves a lot,
between dermatosis and lesion:oneparticular lesionmay suggestvarious different dermatoses
and,converselyoncparticular ematosismayrescnt in lots of differentways.

Primary lesions
Erythema referstoredness of the skin,diffuserlocalisedwhich disappcarswhen a iece
glassispressed overitErythemaresultsfromvasodilatationinthe superficialdermissThis
common lesion has little diagnostic significance. Generalised erythema may sugest atopic
dermatitis,food intolerance (Fig.2:1),cutaneous drug reaction or epitheliotropic T cell
lymphoma. Localised erythema should lead to suspicion of an infection or infestation (e.g.
dermatophytosis （Fig.22)or demodicosis）,or,depending n itslocation,actinic orcontact
dermatitis.
Purpura refers to a darkred,non-palpable spotwhich does not disappear when a piece of glass
is pressed over it.It results from cxtravasation ofred blood cellsfrom dermalvessels3.s
Purpuricmaculesarecalledpetchiaewhenunctateorlnticularandecchyoseswhenr
extensive (Fig.2: 3).Purpura is rare in the cat and should be considered a sign of disordered
blood clotting(e.g.peripheral orcentral thrombocytopaenia) or other systemic illnes.Platelet
purpura occurs in thrombocytopaenia and vascular purpura in necrotising vasculitis that
accompanies infectious illnesses (e.g. feline infectious peritonitis).

Hyperpigmenied macules arise from an incrcasc in mclanin pigmentation.Circumscribed areas
of hypermelanosis may be congenital (e.g.lentigo) and caused by an increase in the number of
melanin pigmentation (e.g.in pemphigus foliaccus or pancreatic paraneoplastic alopecia
(Fig.2:4)),and associated with melanocytic hyperactivity.Hypopigmentedmacules relate to a
reduction (hypomelanosis） or absence of (amelanosis) melanin pigments.In the cat, the
generalised conditions (picbaldism,Wardenburg Syndrome and albinism).

as they are fragile and short-lived.Follicular pustules are centred around a hair and usually
indicate bacterial infection (e.g.bacterial folliculitis (rare in the cat)and acne)(Figs 2:5,6),
dermatophytosisor,veryrarely,intra-follicular demodicosis.Non-follicularpustules areflat and
independent of hair follicles.Also very fleeting,they are seen mostly in superficial pemphigus
conditions(foliaceus and erythematosus).Both follicular and non-follicular pustules containing
eosinophils are sometimes seen in allergic dermatoses,eosinophilic granuloma complex and
notoedric mange.
A papuleis asmall,raisedcircumscribed swelling associatcdwith thickening of theepidermis or

dermal.Epidermal papules are foundin squamous cell carcinoma in situ(Fig.2:7）.Follicular
papules are common in cats with miliary dermatitis and allergic dermatitis,in which case the
infiltrate is made up mainly of cosinophils. In dermalophytosis and bacterial folliculitis,
follicularpapulesoftendevelopintinra-follicularpustulesprogressingtowardsfurunculosis
inflammatory cells: eosinophils and mast cells in allergic dermatitis （Fig.2:6),eosinophils in
eosinophilic granuloma complex,andmast cellsin urticaria pigmentosa.Papules sometimes join
together to form plaques (eosinophilic plaques)(Fig.2:8).Some dermal papules callcd
dysmetabolic papules （Fig.2:9)arc associated with an intradermal excess of amorphous
material which accumulates secondary to a systemic metabolic disorder.These papules are rare.
Theymay be due to dermal accumulation of lipid(xanthoma),secondary to diabetes mellitus,or
a primary lipid disorder (e.g.familial hypertriglyceridaemia).

Secondary lesions
Scalerefcrstowhitishflakesofkeratinthatbreakoff fromthethickenedhornylayersThis
common lesion has only very slight diagnostic value.Scale is classified according to its size:
pytiriasiform scalesare small,thin andwhitishandseenin allergic dermatoses,some parasitic
dcrmatoses (e.g.cheyletiellosis and pediculosis),and some cases of dermatophytosis (Fig.2:
13);psoriasiform scales are broad and quite thick and found in cutaneous epitheliotropic
lymphoma (Fig.2:14）,degenerativemucinous,lymphocytic,mural foliculitis,herpesvirus
associated erythema multiforme,or paraneoplastic exfoliative dermatosis （Fig.2:15).
Epidermal collarettes are rarely reported in the cat (Fig. 2: 16).
Sclerosisisalesion,often shiny,of the skin and subcutaneous connective tissue,relating toan
alterationinthenumber of collagen andelastinfibres234.15Itisrareinthecatand seenin
morphea 1 (Fig. 2: 17).
Atrophy refers to thinning of the skinwhich can lead to persistent flaccidity and appcarancc of
skin folds.It is due to a reduction in thenumber of structural elements in the epidermis and more
especially,the dermis （collagen and elastin fibres)234s(Fig.2:18）.Atrophy isvery hard to
appreciate,given the thinness of cat skin. In some cases (e.g. dermatosparaxis or
hyperadrenocorticism),atrophy may lead to skin tearing.Skin atrophy may also be seen in
pancreaticparaneoplastic alopecia.
Erosions and ulcers are defects involving the epidermis (erosions) or dermis and hypodermis
（ulcers)2..Erosions,unlike ulcers,heal without scarring.These lesions have only slight
diagnostic valuc.Erosions arc common in thc cat in pruritic dermatoses such as allergic
dermatitis (Fig.2:19),parasitic dermatoses,and skin conditions associated with behavioural
disorders.Ulcers are rarer and may occur secondary to specific bacterial infections,deep
mycoses,certain tumours,auto-inmunc dcrmatoscs and certain dermatological manifestations of
acquired systemic diseases such as acquired cutaneous hyperfragility syndrome (Fig. 2:20).
Ulcers seen in squamous cell carcinomas are considered to be primary lesions.
Crust is amixture of blood,serum,exudateand/or puswhich has driedat the surfaceof the skin,
and towhich scale and hair have adhered.It is usually secondary to rupture of a vesicle,bulla or
allpruritic dermatoses,especially allergic dermatitis:and punctate crusts seen in miliary
dermatitis (Fig.2:22)
in the dog.Lichenified lesions have been seen in atopic dermatitis  (Fig.2:23).
A comedone is a dilated hair follicle filledwith sebum,keratinocytes and sometimes bacteria

Differential diagnosis
Taking ahistory and conducting a good clinical examination allows the clinician toformulate a
differentialdiagnosisconsistingofatmost5conditionslistednorderofuspicion.Thesecondition
can beruled in or out by conducting carefully chosen diagnostic tests14
Diagnostic tests
The choice of test depends on the precise differcntial diagnosis,ease of doing the test and the
likely delayingeting theresults.Whenadefinitive diagnosiscannot beestablishedfollowing
simple andrapid testing proceduresa further set of testswill beneededIn suchcases,interm
therapy is often indicated to relieve clinical signs and help point to a diagnosis 24. This may
constitute a true therapeutic trial e.g.flea control when flea allergy dermatitis is suspecled.
Simple diagnostictestsforimmediateinterpretation
The trichogram（Table 2:5) is a dctailed examination of hair involving tip,shaft and root.About
20-30 hairs aremounted in liquid paraffin on a microscope slide and under a cover slip(Figs 2:
25,26). They are examined microscopically (using average light intensity) at a magnification of x40,
x100 and x250.This procedure can reveal thefollowing:
1) stage of the hair cycle (anagen or telogcn)
2)condition of the hair tip(whether damaged)
3) state of the hair shaft (which can be altered in many ways including invasionby spores and hyphae
in dermatophytosis,and production of follicularcasts in acne and demodicosis)

2:Diagnostic approach
Various techniques can be used depending on the type of lesion (Figs 2: 33,34) (Table 2 :
6).Smears should be air-dried rapidly before staining in order to limit damage tocclls.Various
stains are available including rapid stains (e.g.Diff-Quik),Giemsa stain and Wright's stain.
These stains allow specific staining of cytoplasm,nucleus and micro-organisms.Staining of
nucleus andnucleolus isnotasgood as that sccn with thevital stainsbut good enough to
distinguishneoplasia fromhyperplasia Diff-Quik cannot beused formetachromatic staining
somast cell granulcs will not all show up.Thevital stains include haematoxylin and eosin,

nucleolus,andallow appreciation of cellular architecture as well as some cytoplasmicgranules
and fungal elements.Ontheotherhandcytoplasmic structures and bacteria stain poorlywith

Additional tests
Fungal culture is essential for specific identification of dermatophytes.Culture media
include Sabouraud’s and DermatophyteTest Medium(DTM).DTM is Sabouraud’smedium
with added phenol red,which changes colour rapidly,within 3-10 days,in the presence of
a dermatophyte,giving a rapid indication of the likely diagnosis.Early colour changc is
followed by dermatophytegrowth andproduction of alkalinemetaboliteswhich leadstothe
culture medium turning red (Fig.2: 35).An cxccption is sccn in the case of Microsporum
persicolor. Growth of this dermatophyte precedes the colour change by several days.A later
colour change, after 2-4 weeks, is seen with growth of saprophytic fungi (e.g.Aspergilus
spp.and Mucor spp.) or bacteria (Fig. 2:35). DTM is a good culture medium but
microscopical examination of the culture is necessary for specific identification.The lesion
to be sampled should be disinfectedwith a spirited swabfor30seconds to eliminate most
of the contaminants.Hair and scale should be taken from the centre and edgeof thelesion
Cats suspected of being asymptomatic carriers should be brushed with a sterile carpet
square or toothbrush (Fig.2:36)which is then placed directly on the culture medium.The
sample should bc inoculated,under sterile conditionsat the pefiphery of theagar,uing
either a platinum loop or a pair of blunt forceps (Fig.2:37).Incubation is slow (10-21
days)and is carried out at 25-27C.Dermatophyte examination involves both macroscopic
and microscopic culture examination. Colonies are examined microscopically according to

0.05ml of each allergenic extract is then injected intradermally.The test is read at 15minutes
and at 48 hours (delayed reactions are possible in flea allergy dermatitis).Interpretation is
based on the same criteria as in the dog at 15minutes.A reaction is considcred positive if an
erythematouspapulelargerindiametrthantheaveragediameterof thepositive andegative

site of the positive control or other extracts,as in thedog.Inflea allergy dermatitis,a delayed
reactionmay be seen after 48 hours, with skin thickening or a small nodule at the site of
injection of whole flea cxtract.Some allergens in low concentrations,will induce positive
intradermal reactions in normal cats.These may be either irritant reactions or genuine
positive reactions,there being a difference between clinical sensitivity and skin reactivity.
Furtheradditional tests
Bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity are less frequently indicated than in the dog.
They are indicated only in recurrent pyoderma,paronychia,specific bacterial infections
(which arerare),and suppurative otitis externa whenevercytologyreveals amixed bacterial
growth (cocci and bacilli）. If ccrtain specific bacterial infections (e.g. mycobacterial
infection ornocardiosis) are suspected,a specialist laboratory should be contacted.
Skin biopsies should be carried out whenever the history and clinical examination suggest a
dermatosis that requires histopathological diagnosis;when a reasoned diagnostic approach
has not produced a diagnosis; orwhen apparently rational treatment has been unsuccssful .
They are aiso indicated fornodular or ulcerative lesionsor for unusualor severe skin
conditions.Primary lesions are normally selected for skin biopsy; older lesions affected by
scratching,maceration,secondary infection and topical treatments should generally be
avoided.Lesions in different stages of development should be biopsied.Different procedures
involving excisional biopsy or punch biopsy can be used.Biopsy punches in 4,6 and 8mm
(e.g.nodules),fragile lesions (e.g.pustules and vesicles) and deep lesions (e.g.panniculitis).
microscopy or for some immunohistochemical procedures,specimens should be fixed by
freezing in liquid nitrogen.Biopsies should be sent to a veterinary histopathologist
dermatopathology.
Blood tests（e.g.biochemistryhaematologyandendocrineprofiles;serology）areindicatedinth
investigation of certain conditions2.
Imaging techniques (e.g.radiology,ultrasonography and CT scanning) are necessary for
diagnosing skin conditions associated with certain systemic illnesses and skin tumours.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is based on finding these 6-legged,orange-coloured larvae,either with the naked eyeor
with a magnifying glass.They can be identified on microscopical examination (Table 3: 1)(Fig. 3: f).
Bcwarned,thesc larvae are not always present at the time of consultation
frcatment
Treatmentisdifficult andrequiresrepeated application of acaricide.
Fipronil ** spray, 0.25%,applied monthly to the whole body. is moderately effective in the cat ".
However,increasing the frequency (twice weekly) of spraying in larval predilection sites leads to
much better efficacy (E. Guaguere, personal observations,1998).
along with pesticide sprays is strongly advised '
Demodicosis
Actiopathogenesis
Feline demodicosis is caused by the excessive proliferationof 2species ofmite from the family
Demodicidac:Denodex cati,a resident of pilo-sebaceous unitsand Demodex gatoi,a shorter mite
that lives in the superficial layers of the epidermis (Table 3: 1).Their life cycle and mode of
transmission are not well understood. Age does not seem to be a predisposing factor, although the

underlying illnesses include FeLV and FIV infection,diabetes mellitus,hyperadrenocorticism,

Burmese breeds seem to be predisposed 
Clinical features
The head and neck are the main areas affected,more rarely the trunk and limbs.Skin lesions are
characterised by erythema,papules or pustulcs,localised or diffuse hair loss,scaling,erosions.

(after a week). It comes in various formulations including collar, spray and surface-acting spot-on.
CSIs (e.g.lufenuron and flufenoxuron)affect chitin synthesis during moulting.Lufenuron prevcnts
cggs from hatching,causing larvac to dic and leading to an absence of adults emerging from the
pupae.Lufenuron is given orally,every month,or by subcutaneous injection every 6months.It is
storedin thefat,thenreleased into thebloodready for ingestionby the feeding flea.
Treatmentoftheenvironment
Control ofnon-parasitic stages and pre-emerged adultsinthe environment isvitalas these stages
make up 95% of the total flea population.Noting down all the potentially infested placcs (e.g.
slceping place,arcas the animal walks through andcar flooring)is the first step ina proper
environmental control strategy.

Mechanicalmeasures
Mechanical measures like cleaning andvacuuming(rememberingfirstly,toremovecushions from
armchairs and settees) are essential preliminary measures that have long been underestimated.

faeces (main food supply for the larvae), should be eliminated.
Chemical measures
Insect Growth Regulators （e.g.methoprene,pyriproxyfen and flufenoxuron)act on non-parasitic
stages.Thcy comc in various fornulations.Foggcrs cnable a large volume of product to be dispersed
in the environment.Initial cleaning is still necessary,in order to reach larval forms which are
positively geotropic and negatively phototropic. ln most cases,sprays must be used in association
with foggcrs in order to trcat themore inaccessible regions.
Adulticides,whether or not they are micro-encapsulated,stay on surfaces when sprayed in the
thc othcr hand,these adulticides dokill adults thatemergeregularlyfrom their cocoons,before they
are able to find a host.Most available environmental preparations,therefore,combine an adulticide
with anIGR
Sodium polyborates (activated orthoboric acid) come in powder form and are used in Great Britain
and the United States for environmental treatment.Theywork by abrading the flea cuticleand then

Control strategy
Prescribing the right flea control products requires good clinical knowledge and a thorough
understanding of the parasite.The level of parasitic infestation determines the extent of the control
programme which can range from simple application of insecticide on the cat to intensive,combined
therapy involving animals and environment, employing mechanical and chemical mcasures. Strategy
must also be adapted to the animal’s life style (e.g.where it goes,points of entry,presence of in-
contacts). If the surroundings are completely enclosed (e.g. a flat), the use of IGRs is justified and
effective.If thc cat hasFAD,flea control should be aimcd at complctcly cliinating thc parasitc and
preventing its re-appearance,by treating the cat,in-contact animals and the environment.
Flea infestation
In heavyinfestations,if is best to eliminatemost fleas rapidly with a topical insecticide,whateverits
mode ofaction,ornitenpyram.To avoidpermanentreinfestation,aresidual insecticide should then
be used in association with an IGR for at least 6 months. Other animals (dogs and cats)in the house
should also be treated.
For the occasional orless severe infestation,any insecticide will beeffective,providedit isused
correctly. If the infestation persists, or if there are other animals in the house, IGRs should be
prescribed. In some cases, treatment of non-parasitic stages in the cnvironmcnt is nccessary.

antifeeding actions than permethrin are actually more effective.This efficacy is associated with a
substantial,albeit more gradual,reduction in thelevel of infestation which fallsbelow the allergenic
consistof just oncflca.Furthcrmorc,thc abscnceofsuddcnreinfestation contributes toclinicalremission.
Whatever product isused,it is best toincrease the frequency of application （e.g.fipronil should be given
every 3 or 4weeks).In addition to treating the affected cat,flea control must involve treating the
cnvironment and all in-contact animals.The use of products likefipronil or imidacloprid which have
residual activity, also enables control of somenon-parasitic stages in the environment.

The second phase consistsof long-term controlof thc infestation and preventingrecurrence.Whatever
treatment isproposed,flea control should be ongoing andapplied allyearround.Use ofresidual
products (e.g.fipronil and imidacloprid),the frequency of which can be increased,will enable a
number of fleas,below the allcrgcnic thrcshold for signs to develop,to persist.IGRs on the animal
(or in the environment) are also very useful aftcr the start of thefirst phase of treatment.

Mode of infection
The naturallyinfective stageis the arthrospore,formed by segmentation andfragmentation of fungal
hyphae.Cats become infected either by direct contactwith an infected animal or by contact with a
contaminaicd environment.The latterisan under-recognisedreservoirof infectionforboth people and
other animals.The number of spores needed to trigger dermatophytosis in a susceptiblecat is unknown.
Large amounts of infective material are present in homes and the environment of infected cats.Airborne

transmission by contaminated collars,brushes, toys,hide boxes, transport cages, etc. may be
considerable.Depending onambient conditions,spores canremainviableformanymonths.
Predisposingfactors
Wheninfective arthrospores contact a cat's coat,many factors influence whether ornot successful
infection occurs.
Groomingbehaviour of cats is animportant natural dfence against infection;it canbe difficult to

Increased hydrationandsubsequentmacerationoftheskin arevery common factorsin the
pathogenesis of human infections,enhancing the ability of dermatophytes to penetrate the skin and
favouring germination of spores.Natural barrers to dermatophytc infection include thedesert-like
conditions of the epidermis and thefungistatic activity of sebum and certainfactorsin serum
Temperature.Germination of sporesis temperature-dependent.
Sun-bathing may be protective and inhibit germination.
Excessivebathingandgroomingmaypredisposecatstodermatophytosisbyremovingnatural barriers
to dermatophyte infection (fungistatic sebum and serum factors make up a chemical barricr and
superficial epidermal layers constitute a mechanical barrier),andby increasing thehumidityof thecoat.
Risk factors
These include being very young or very old,poor nutrition,the presence of ectoparasites,
immunosuppression (e.g.retrovirus infection,neoplasia,corticosteroid therapy and chemotherapy).

Immuneresponse
The imimune competence ofthe host is very important inprotection from dermatophyteinfection.
Recovery from dermatophytosis requires the developiment of an cffective cellular immune response 
Induction of anti-dermatophyte antibodies does not generally protect against infection.The lack of
dcvclopment of a cellularimmune response maybe a cause of chronicinfectionin some cats.These cats
may developtoleranceto thedermatophyte.Inaddition,thefungal infectionmayproduceenzymesthat

Clinical features
Feline dermatophytosis isverypleomorphicinits clinical presentation and should be considered in the
lifferential diagnosis of allfeline skinconditionsThe highlycontagiousnatureof thisdisease,aswell
as the public health consideration,further underscore the urgcncy to rule this disease out as quickly as
possible.
Pruritus is variable ranging from absent to intense.The most common lesion is an irregular on
circular patch of peripherally expanding hair losswith scale,crust and sometimes erythema.
Hair loss can be very subtle, symmetrical or non-symmetrical, inflammatory or non-
inflammatory.Hairs are usually broken or frayed. The face (Figs 4: 1-3) and distal limbs (Figs
4:4.5) are most commonly affected,cspccially inkittens,and lesions are often inflammatory
andexfoliative.
Other,sometimesvery striking,clinicalformsmaybe seen:exfoliative erythrodermasometimes

Directexamination ofhair andscale
This is a time consuming technique.Its use requires some training because numerous microscopic items
can easily beconfusedwith arthrospores.Thistestis easierif fluorescing hairs are used.Microsporum
canis infections are ectothrixinfections (spores formed on the surface of hairs)(Fig.4:17) and,in most
cases, hairs can be cxamincd using liquid paraffin. Clcaring agcnts such as potassium hydroxide (KOH),
chloral lactophenol andIndian ink may alsobe used but care mustbe taken to avoid artifacts.
A technique using calcofluor white and10 percent KOHfor the rapid identification of fungal elements in
cats has been described.In bothhuman and animal specimcns,calcofluor white andKOHwas found to
be superior toKOH alone.Calcofluorwhite is a textile brightener that binds to chitin and cellulose and,
under ultraviolet light,gives off an apple-greenfluorescence.Broken or frayed hairs and scales takenfron

10-15minutes.Although examination is enhanced if a fluorescent microscope isused,a standardlight
microscope and Wood's lamp are often sufficient.
Fungal culture
Fungal cultureis still considered the gold standard for diagnosing feline dermatophytosis as it allows
genus andspeciesidentification of thecausal organism.Tothbrushfungal cullures themostime and
cost-effective technique for culturing cats.A sterile toothbrush(toothbrushes in their original packaging
are mycologicallysterile)is passed over the cat'sbody and/or clinically suspicious lesions.The bristles
are then stabbed intofungal culture media.There are nowmany commcrcially availablc brands of fungal

Skin biopsies
Histopathological examination of skin biopsiescan be carried out and will confirm a diagnosis of
dermatophytosis in about 80% of cases. This procedure would appear to be particularly indicated in
kerions and eumycetomas.Biopsies can be taken with a biopsy punch (6 mm diameter),from the centre
of the lesion,or with a scalpel blade in decp lesions such as cumycctomas.Although classic stains (e.g

befound, and in mycctomas,a granulomatous panniculitis may bc sccn around thc hyphae (Fig.4 : 24)
Treatment
Dermatophytosiswill resolve spontaneouslywithin afwmonthnhealthy,mmun-compctcntcats.
However,leaving the disease to resolve itself is rarely advised because dermatophytosis is both
contagious and zoonotic.Therefore,the goals of therapy are to hasten recovery,minimise or prevent the

Deep mycoses
Deepmycoses are caused by the growth and proliferation of saprophytic fungi that normally live in the soil,

them are considered opportunistic pathogens.In man,they cause diseases in neutropenic orimmunodeficicnt
individuals '.The link between deep fungal infections and the immune system still requires clarification in
veterinary medicine,although thc majority of cases probably arisefollowing a reduction in the cell-mediated
immuneresponse.

Treatment
The treatment of choice is oral itraconazole（5-10mg/kgSIDorBID)continued forat least2months
beyond clinical resolution. Oral fluconazole (5-15 mg/kg SID or BID) can be used when the central
nervous system is affected. Oral flucytosinc (50 mg/kg TID) and intravenous amphotericin B (0.1 to 0.5
mg/kg,three timesweekly)are nowused a lot less frequently.Voriconazole,anewbroad spectum
antifungal triazole agent may be an alternative therapy in years to come .For lesions restricted to the
skin or nasal mucosae,response to treatment isusuallygood.
Histoplasmosis
Aetiopathogenesis
Histoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus,Histoplasma capsulatum. In its
mycelial form,thisfungusis a saprophyte of humid,nitrogen-rich soils.The disease is endemic in the
Mississippi,the Missouri,the Ohiovalleys,andmany parts ofthe tropics.Ithas also beenreported

Bacterial dermatoses
Bacterial dermatoses,also called pyodermas,are rare in the cat despite being so common in the dog
Themain reasons for this are perhaps the small number of bacteria on the skin and coat of the cat and
also the importance of grooming incats.Bacterial skin infections aremost often secondary to trauma,
bites or scratches and resolve easily with suitable antimicrobial treatment.On the other hand,some
specific bacterial infections,possibly secondary to a systemic illness (e.g.retrovirus infection),can be
difficult both to diagnose and to treat.
Abscesses
Aetiopathogenesis
Abscesses are soft tissue infections,caused by the introduction of bacteria into subcutaneous
connectivctissuc,with a biteorscratch.Thebacteriaresponsiblebelong toresidentoralflora.They
may be facultative or obligatory anaerobes,including gram negative bacilli such as Pasteurella
multocidaFubactrimp.,pirchatandra-ositivcoccinpaicular-amolti
streptococci°. Entire males are predisposed because of their aggressive nature.
Clinical features
Dermatological signs are characterised by mostly well-circumscribed and fluctuant,painful
swellingswhich subsequently burst.Bite marks are sometimes visible.Abscesses do not localise in
any one particular place although the face,neck and limbs (Fig.6:1) are most affected in dominant
cats and the tail is a typical site in submissive cats.
Systemiuhanrxiahargydnallhaenpatestaial
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is easy and based on the history and clinical signs. Cytological examination of pus,
bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity,and screening for retroviruses are necessaryinrecurrent
cases.
Treatment
Lancing,surgical drainage and flushingwithantiseptic solutions such aschlorhexidine（0.5%),
dilute povidonc-iodine or 3% hydrogen peroxide,is necessary in themajority of cases.
Systemic antimicrobial treatment involves the use of broad spectrumantibioticsfor about 10 days.
As Pasteurella multocida is frequently isolated,penicillins are the antibiotic of choice.Whcn
anaerobic bacteria are present, clindamycin is a good choice of antibiotic (Table 6: 1).

Superficial pyoderma
Aetiopathogenesis
Superficialpyoderma is rare but probably underdiagnosed.It usually follows an underlying
dermatosis (allergic dermatitis,auto-immune dermatosesdemodicosis etc.), systemic illness (e.g
rctrovirus infection) or imnunosuppressive treatment (e.g. coricosteroids and antimitotic thcrapy).
The bacteria most frequently isolated are Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus simulans and
Staphylococcusintermedius".
Clinical features
Superficialpyoderma is characterised clinicallybynon-specificpapules,pustules and,more rarely,
epidermalcollarettsItmaysometimesassumetheappearanceofamiliarydermatitisanerosive
or ulcerativc dcrnatitis (Fig. 6: 2) or lesions of the eosinophilic granuloma complex 3
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is difficult because bacterial skin infection cannot be diagnosed with certainty on clinical
examination alone.Whether lesions arc causcd byinfection or by the underlyingillness,is also
impossible to tell.

an underlying dermatosis.This procedure may reveal intraepidermal pustules containing degenerate
neutrophils,perifolliculitis,or mural or interface folliculitis compatible with bacterial infection.
Special stains maybe used according to the differentials
Bacterial culture should be routine in cases of recurrent pyoderma or when multiple species of
bacteria areseen on cytology
Asearch for an underlying dermatosisorsystemicillness should always be conducted and the
condition identifiedwhere possible.
Treatment
Systemic antimicrobialtherapyis the treatment of choicc.The majority of staphylococci
responsiblefor pyoderma in the cat,areresistant topenicillin,amoxycillin and ampicillin.The
most effective antibiotics are clavulanic acid-potentiated amoxycillin,cephalosporins (e.g.
cephalexin and ccfadroxil),enrofloxacin,marbofloxacin and clindamycin.Trimethoprim-
potentiated sulphonamides are often used in Europe and theUnitcd States(Table 6:1),
although in Australia,strains of Staphylococcus intermedius are very commonlyresistant to
these.Antibiotics should be given for a minimum of 3weeks and should be continued for at
least a week beyond clinical resolution.Paste preparations arc particularly useful,firstly
because they are easy to administer and secondlybecause they can generally be given inone
daily dose.
Antibacterial shampoos are rarely used because cats havc a rcputation (often unjustified) for not
liking being washed.However,shampoos,whenit is possible to apply them easily,form a very
effective adjunctive therapy.A 2-3%chlorhexidine solution isone example.Forlocalisedpyoderma,

Prognosis and treatment
The prognosis is guarded, given the very high incidence of recurrence.

Botryomycosis
Aetiopathogenesis
Botryomycosis isa ubiquitous and underdiagnosed skininfection,caused by non-filamentous
bacteria.Colonies forn grains within pyogranulomatous reactions.Various agents are responsible
and sometimes they may be found in combination.
Pathogenesis of these lesions is poorly understood.Bacteria entering subcutaneous connective tissue
via a wound (e.g.bite or scratch) probably trigger a hypersensitivity reaction and an alteration in the
destructive role of leucocytes.Retrovirus infectionsmight sometimes predispose to botryomycosis
Clinicalfeatures
Dermatologicalsigns areoftenchronic and occurmainly onthe limbs.They arc characterised by
single or multiple,ulcerated or non-ulcerated,alopecic nodules,containing small white or yellow
grains (Fig. 6: 15).Ulccrs or draining tracts may sometimes be seen.
Systemic signs vary according to the presence of an underlying illness (c.g.retrovirus infection)
Diagnosis
The diagnosis is based on lesion distribution, skin biopsies, and identification of the bacteria by
bacterial culture.
Cytological examination of grains (after crushing) reveals very large numbers of non-branching
bacteria.
Histopathological examinationof deep skin biopsiesrcvcals a pyogranulomatous dermatitiswithin
which there are bacterial colonies surrounded by a Splendore-Hoeppli reaction,composedof
polysaccharides and glycoproteins around the bacterial colonies (Fig. 6 : 16).
Bacterial cultureisperformed on skinbiopsics,taken asepticallyandinoculatedontovariousmedia.
Antibiotic sensitivity testing should be conducted
Prognosisand treatment
The prognosis is variable, depending on the presence of an underlying illness.
Treatmentrequiresbroad surgicalexcision,wherepossible,orlesiondebridement withcurcttageand

Viral dermatoses
Viral dermatoses are a developing field infeline dermatology.They arc underdiagnosed because of difficulties
in identifying the causal virus, but new investigative procedures (e.g.electron microscopy.
immunohistochermistry andviral amplification)have enabled thesenew dermatoses to be characterised.An

They also represent a major zoonotic risk for man.

antibiotics and local antiseptic agents. Geling the cat to cat is also necessary and sometimes quite
difficult, due to the painful oral lesions. Corticosteroids are contraindicated and may lead to
devclopment ofsystemic signs&-0
Prophylactic measures are important &.Given the risk of transmitting the condition to anothercat,the
sick cat should be isolated.The virus is quite resistant to ambient temperature and humidity and so
the external surroundings will sometimes need to be cleaned with household bleach.The risk of
zoonotic transmissionisveryrcal,particularlyforimmunodeficient eople,children and theelderly.
In order toreduce theriskof contamination,the owner must,therefore,follow certain precautions
(e.g.wearing gloves when handling the cat) &

Retrovirus infections
Retrovirus infections are themost serious andmost common viral illnesses of the cat.They are caused by
two retroviruses: the leukaemia virus (FeLV) and the feline immunodeficicncy virus (FIV) .Although
humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) is responsible formany,varied skin problems in man,FeLV and
FIV are much more rarely associated with skin disease in cats.
Skin diseasescaused directlybyFeLVvirus
A giantcelldermatosishas beenreported inFeLV-positive cats.Thisis a pruritic dermatosis of
the facee.g.yelidsarea behind theearschinand lips）,pinnae （ulerative otitis),eckan
sometimes trunk,characterised by alopecic, scaling and crusting lesions （Figs 7:13,14)24
within 4 months.Histopathology of skin biopsies revealed syncytial-type giant cells in the
epidermis and follicular outer root sheath.Some of these contained up to thirty nuclei andhad
abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.In these arcas,there was local absence of keratinocyte
maturation along with dyskeratosis of keratinocytes, and sometimes of giant cells (Figs 7:
15,16).Inmunohistochemical studies uinggp70 antiserum demonstrated the presence of gp70
antigenin all cats,solely in the areas containing giant cells.Immunohistochemical studies from
the skin of FeLV-positive cats without the giant cell dermatosis,did not demonstrate gp70
antigenin the skinTheFeLVvirusmayhaveinducedaneoplasticalterationof thekeratinocytes
byrecombination with host oncogenes.The presence ofmany dyskeratotic kcratinocyles is also
a sign ofneoplastic alteration24

are found mainly on the footpads (Figs 7: 17)and sometimes on the face.Histopathology reveals
severe,compact orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis(Figs 7:18),and in some cases,dyskeratosis and
epidermal multinucleate giant cells.Treatimcnt involves surgical excision.These hornsresemble
otherkeratinisation disorders such as acquired ichthyosis orReiter's syndrome seen in human
AIDS patients These hyperproliferative dermatoses might be the conscqucnce of the same
pathophysiological mechanism.It is unknown whether stimulation ofkeratinocytes is caused
direcily by thevirus or by cytokines released bymonocytes or T lymphocytes infected by the
HIV virus 2,

Dermatoses induced byB lymphocyte activation
In feline retrovirus infections,humoral immune system derangement lcads to B lymphocyte
activation .This can sometimes causc plasma cell infiltration in the mouth (plasma cell
stomatitis）, footpads (plasma cell pododermatitis) and the pinnae (plasma cell chondritis）. It
should, however, be noted that none of these skin and mucous membrane plasma cell
proliferativelesionsisrelated specifically tofeline retrovirus infection.Asa general rule,plasma
cell infiltration should be treatedasa chronic reaction pattern thatmay arise inresponse to
various different antigens (bacteria, viruses, etc.)
Plasma cell stomatitisischaracterisedbypainfulproliferativelesionsonthepalatoglossal folds

bleed. In some studies,FIV infection has been found to be a predisposing factor (15-30% of
cases were FIV-positive). This was not truc for FeLV infection (less than 6% of cases were
FeLV-positive).Lesions are similar to those seen in plasma cell gingivitis inmanyHIV patients 2
Failure of the immunological barrier of the oral cavity may be induced by certainviruses (e.g.
FIV and Calicivirus) and pathogenic periodontal bacteria (e.g.Porphyromonas spp.),often
present in huge numbers in periodontal disease.This failure could explain some features of the
pathophysiology of plasma cell stomatitis.It has recently been reported that odontoclastic
Plasma cellpododermatitis is rareand usually starts with marked pain in one or more
metacarpal or metatarsal footpads. These swollen footpads are soft and painful in the ccntre,
causing lameness.With time,swellings,which ulcerate and bleed at the slightest touch,develop
are,the more likely they are to develop secondary infection. Cats are sometimcs affectcd
systemically with pyrexia,listlessness,anorexia,anaemia and peripheral lymphadenopathy.
Plasma cell stomatitis is sometimes also present.In one recent study of 18 cases of plasma cell
pododermatitis,nearly 50%of catswere FIV-positive.In another study,lesions of plasma cell
pododermatitis were found in 6 out of 9 catswith natural FIV infection.FIV-immunorcactive

Opportunistic skin infections associated with T cell immunosuppression
opportunistic infections in man have been published.However, some studies do attempt to show
anassociation between certain clinicalmanifestations and status of one or other of the
retrovirusesThe development of opportunistic skininfections isrelated to an already advanced

Mycoses make up the main group of opportunistic infections linked toFeLV or FIV (Table 7:1)
Few studies on the fungal skinflora of catscarryingretroviruseshave beenconducted.Itis
universally true,however,that more fungi (genera and species)are carriedby catswith a positive
retroviral status .Theincidence of Microsporum canis carriagevarics in different studics from
10%-75%.These substantial differences arise because of the diverse nature of the populations
tested .No study has shown that superficial and deep (subcutaneous and systemic)mycoses
(Table 7:1) are more common in retrovirus-positive cats.The very most that can be said is that
they are clinically more severe andricher infungal elements,and that they resolve more slowly

Multicentric bacterial paronychia is very common inretrovirus-positive cats,especially those
that are FIV-positive. Stained smears taken from the digital region show several species of
intracellular and extracellular bacleria (cocci and bacilli.Thc prognosis is often guarded.

Thishasbeen reported indogs,cattle,goats and sheep,but also in catsSometimes severe blood loss can
lead to death.Catfleas can also transmit some intestinal parasites.Dipylidium caninum is one of the most
common intestinal elminths of dogs,cats,and rarely children.It develops as an immature form (cysticercoid)
in the fleas of cats,dogs and humans.The flea larvae ingest theeggswhich develop into cysticercoids in the
body of the flea.Whengrooming,dogs and cats can swallow theinfestedfleas and the cysticercoids are then
released.
Species of flea encountered
Although many species of flea have been reported in cats,only Ctenocephalides felisfelis(Fig.8:1),

cannot kill all the fleas before they have started to feed.Productswith insect repellent properties can,
nevertheless,reduce the size of the blood meal.

felis can take up13.6μl of blood per day.After rapidly passing through the digestive tract, the blood is
cxcreted and drieswithinafewminutes to formblackishdroppings orcharacteristiclong tubularspirals(Fig.
8:3）.Droppings dispersed in the environment become an essential food item for the larvae.Reducing the
amount offaeces in the environment couldreducefuturefleapopulations.Thiscan be achieved bywashing or
vacuuming the areaswhere the animals spend most of theirtime,in particular their sleeping andrestingplaces.

the fleas have fd andegglaying starts24to48hours after the firstbloodmeal Fig.8:4）.Females stay
on their host and lay their eggs in the fur; the eggs then fall off into the environment.
As reproduction is closely linked to the host,the flea's life cycle can be interrupted at host level.To achieve
this, treatiment must prevent reproduction of the fleas by using an adulticide with residual activity.Fleas are
thenkilledwithin 24 to36hours,before they canreproduce.Reproduction can alsobe stopped or diminished
by the administration of systemic or topical insect growth regulators.

cats.Allergic catscan take in andeliminate up to 25%of their fleas per day,through ingestion andpermanent

The eggs fall from the fur and accumulate in areas where the animals spend most of their time, in

The eggs generallyhatch within 1 to6daysdepending nthe temperature andrelative humidity (RH)

Flea allergy dermatitis
Flea allergy dcrmatitis (FAD)is the most common pruritic dermatosis in the cat.A diagnosis of FAD cannot
be eliminated by the absence of fleas orflea faeces because allergic catscanremovefleasfrom their coat by

Treatment initiallyinvolves rigorous flea control for the affected cat,in-contact animals and the environment.
When antipruritic treatment is necessary, the use of corticosteroids produces immediate improvement.
Immunotherapy is,currently,ofno benefit.

Atopy is a condition involvinga hereditarypredisposition to the developmentof hypersensitivity
reactions to environmental antigens.It can causerespiratory,digestive,ocular and dermatological signs
with atopic dermatitisbeing one of the possible clinical manifestations.There is a tcndency to assume
that any animal in which sensitivitics to acroallergens (airborne allergens) are demonstrated is atopic
and,therefore,that any cat with a pruritic dermatosis and positive intradermal test reactions to
aeroallergens has atopic dermatitis . Sensitisation to airborne allergens,whether demonstrated by
intradermal testing or by serological methods,occurs in many normal cats and is, thcrcforc,not
synonymous withatopyIf the same critria used inother species are applied tocats,thetermatopic
dermatitis"should be reserved for a discrete clinical entityinvolving corticosteroid-responsive pruritus
of the face and feet and a genetic component,indicatedeither by the cat's family history or breed
predisposition (Table 10 : 1).

Diagnosis
The aim of an allergyinvestigationis to determine the allergens responsiblefor the clinical signs of atopy.This
firstinvolves taking a detailed history tonarrowdown thelistofpossible allergens.Without thisinformation,
interpretation of allergy testing is impossiblc.The main purposc of allcrgy testing is to select allergens for
inclusion in an immunotherapy course and put in place allergen-avoidance measures (e.g. dietary restriction,
flea control and avoidanceof airborne and contact allergens)
Restriction/challenge tests
Avoiding the causal allergen is only really practical for food allergens andfleainfestations.A cat
depending on clinicalresponse,although such a diet can be difficult to enforce if the animal lives
outside.Flea controlmeasures must always be adopted because flea bite hypersensitivity is a
contributoryfactorin the development of pruritus and alsobecausefleainfestationcanincreasethe
chanceofsensitisation toother allergens.Ifpruritusis significantlyreducedfollowingflea controlit
is reasonable to assume that flea allergy dermatitis is associated with the atopy 2
Intradermal testing
Intradermal testing is often unrewardingincats andis the subject of muchcontroversy.The allergenic
extracts are the same as those used in the dog and they are given at the same concentrations.The test
site must first be gently shaved. Then, 0.05 ml of each extract is injected intradermally. The test is
read at 15minutes and interpretedinthe same way as in the dog,i.e.a reaction is considered positive
if an erythematous papule developsaround theinjection sitewitha diametergreater thanthemean
diameter of thepositive andnegative controls.Intradermaltesting canbe difficult to interpret in cats
because the positive control reaction is often very weak(Fig.10: 15).However,in some cats,large,
extract sites (Fig.10 :16).Some allrgens, at low concentrations,can induce positive intradermal
reactions innormal cats.These may be either irritant reactions or genuine positive reactions,there
being a differencebetween clinical sensitivity and cutaneousreactivity
In vitrolaboratory tcsts
Serological lesting
To date,no serological testhasbeen properlyevaluatedin the cat.These proceduresuseanti-feline
IgE （either natural or chimeric) antibodies or anti-human FceRI antibodies, the DNA sequence of
the IgE binding site for its high affinity receptor (FceRI）being apparently very similarin man,dog
and catWith somelboratoriesicanbempossibletofindout thetye anspcificityf tr
antisera.
concentrations ofallergen-specificIgE(particularly forDermatophagoidesfarinae)in normal cats
are comparable to those in cats with atopy-like dermatological signs.However,immunotherapy
based on serological testing is just as successful as that based on intradermal testingsuggesting that
the degree of correlation between thetwo techniques doesnotnecessarilyindicate howreliable each
of them is.
Cellulartests
The direct basophildegranulation test used in humans and dogshasbeen adaptedforuse inthecat
A patient's basophils aremixed in vitrowith different concentrations of the test allergen-if the animal
is allergic,there will be significantly fewer basophils than for the negative control.Results are
expressed asmaximum percentage degranulation or activation.A considerable amount of freshblood
isneeded for this test so its use is generallyvery limited.It represents one of the most interesting
approaches in allrgy diagnosis because it demonstrates both an IgE-dependent reaction and
immunological reagents.
Theindirect basophil degranulationtestismucheasier toperformin thenormal practice situation.
Feline anaphylactic antibodies areheterocytotropic and bind human and horse basophils4swhich
can therefore be sensitised and activated invitro.Although the correlation between theresultsof this
test and intradermal testing isvariable is diagnostic value remains as questionable as that of
serological testing.In a prospective study involving 99 cats with eosinophilicgranuloma complex
lesions, there was no difference in the incidence of sensitisation to either the house dust mite

immunotherapy.
Treatment
Treatmentdependsontheseverity of thecondition,its duration and thepossible presence ofother allergicskin
diseases.
Allergen avoidance
In practiceonly fod allergens can reallybe avoidedAvoidanceof aeroallrgensis only ractical f
the allergens concerned are in a limited area from which the allergic cat can be cxcluded.The most
important allergens for cats in Europe arehouse dust mites and althoughvarious measures aimed at
reducing theirnumber can berecommended,these are only likelytobe effectiveif combinedwith
otherprocedures:veryregularventilationf thecatsurroundingsfrequent aerationof duvets,
matressesandblanketsuse ofavacuumcleanerfittedwithspecial filters(withaporcsize ofunder

regulators and steamcleaning ofsleeping areas
Anti-inflammatory medication

useful in the symptomatic control of atopy in the cat.
Corticosteroids are usually well tolerated by cats and are still the symptomatic treatment of choice.
They can be administeredorally (prednisolone or prednisone,1 to2mg/kg/day,for5 to10 days,then
everyotherday）²orparenterally（methylprenisoloneacetate.5mg/kgor0ng/catgivnby
subcutancous orintramuscular injection or triamcinolone acetonide,5mg/cat,given subcutaneously)²
Parenteral administration is sometimes prcfcrablebecause many ownersfind it very difficult to give

therefore,only be usedwhen other treatments are unsatisfactory.

Antihistamines are very useful in the trcatment of allergic skin disorders in the cat.The most

Diagnosis
In practice,establishing adefinitive diagnosis can be difficult andrequires arigorous approach.The animals
historymuteoroughlyrvicwedingthcatslvingandaingabitsand tdtitelfcially
with respect to protein and carbohydrate sources.The physical examination should be methodical.Food
intolerance should always be considered in an animal with a non-parasitic pruritic dermatosis.
Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis is that of all pruritic dermatoses,including initially the ectoparasitic
infestations （e.g.cheyletiellosis,notoedric mange,trombiculiasis and pediculosis.),other causes of
allergic dermatitis and dermatophytosis.Facial involvement entails amore detailed diagnostic
approach to rule out auto-immune dermatoses and certain viral infections...
Diagnostic tests
Hematological profiles （diffcrcntial count,etc.) are worthless;at best they might reveal non
diagnostic eosinophilia.Histopathological examination of skin biopsies does not provide any spccific
informationbutusuallyrevealsperivascularnflammationwithvaryingnumbersofeosinophilsand
mast cells,indicating allergic dermatitis in genera 24.6
Elimination diets
The nexl stage is to instigate an elimination diet,the aim ofwhich is to give the cat one or more
foodstuffswhichithasnever eatenbefore.Although this sounds simple,in practicc it canbe fraught
with problems bothbecause these days,commercial cat foods containawidevariety of different
proteins andbecause owners oftenfind it difficult tomake theircatfollow astrict diet; prior to settling
on a diet,it is crucial to asscss the owner’s motivation.Before the effects of an elimination diet can
be properly evaluated,all secondary and concomitant skin problems must be controlled, e.g.flca
allergy dermatitis and secondary infections（although these arerarein cats）.Certain preliminary
guidelines are important:the food must be offered ona plate (avoid plastic or metal),toys should be
takenaway andnthry,no reatsvitaminsmineralsupplements ordrugsshouldbegiven during
the timeofthe diet.Prescribingcorticosteroidscannot alwaysbeavoidedandinthiscase,thespecial
least two weeks following the end of the drug course 2.6
Thechoice of foodstuffs should take into account the cat‘snormal eating habits.The choice of diet
needs tobe a joint decision,taken with the owner,and the cat's eating habits should not be changed
toorapidly.Thenewdiet should thereforc bc introduced gradually,over the course of 4 to5 days.lt

Diagnosticvalue of intradermal testingand invitroIgEtesting

responsible. However, this must not adversely affect the nutritional balance of the diet.
unlessvitamin andmineral supplements areincluded.Therefore,owners can either feed their animals
a balanced home-prepared diet based on the hypoallrgenic diet or give very digestible commercial
products.
Symptomatictherapy
histamines are ineffective.Some reports have recommended chlorpheniramine (4-8mg/animal ID,
orally).
Treatingsecondaryinfections
Secondary skin infections are rare but,in cats with gastrointestinal symptoms,it is important to
control bacteria in the small intestine by prescribing a suitable antibiotic(metronidazole)²in order to
breaktheviciouscycleofsensitisationfollowedbytheaggravationofgastrointestinallesionsleading
to exacerbated dermatological signs.

Clinical features
Indolent ulcer
Theindolentulcer,also incorrectly calledeosinophiliculcer,is an ulceratedlesion of theupper lip,
which,most commonly,cxtends cither side of the philtrum（Figs 12:1-5）or the hard palate（Fig.12
:4).It varies in size from 5mm to more than 5 cm in length.It is not unusual for the ulcer to start
oppositeacanine tooth(ig125）.At thebeginningerythma appearsonitswn,followed bya
well-circumscribed areaof ulceration,reddishbrown ncolour,alopecic and glistening.The borderis
slightly raised,revealing a central sphacelus (Figs 12 : 1,2).This lesion is gcncrally non-pruritic and
non-painful.Palatine lesions (Fig. 12 : 4) can affect small arterioles and produce haemorrhages.
However, as the cat swallows the blood, thesego mostly unnoticed 1Regional lymph glands are
sometimes enlarged.Clinically similar lesions seen at thelip commissure,on the gums,tonguc,
palate,pharynx and chin are usually eosinophilic granulomas.No breed predilection has been
observed. However, femalesmay be predisposed.
Eosinophilicplaque
Eosinophilicplaques are alopecic,raised,rythematous,rosive andulcerated lesions,varying from
small poorly defined erosions to large well-circumscribed plaques (Figs 12: 6-10).Favoured sites are
the abdomen,inguinal region,medial and caudal thighs,neck and interdigital spaces.Lesions are
associated withconstant licking,nibblingand scratching.
Eosinophilic granuloma
Alsocalled lineargranuloma because of thelinear shape of one ofitscommon forms,theeosinophilic
granuloma is a pinkish, scaly lesion involving intact skin and variable alopecia (Figs 12 : 11,12).
These lesions arenot pruritie and are very oftcn asymptomatic.

is needed.
History
Historical and clinical details suggesting allergy are seasonality of lesions,exacerbated grooming,
self-induced alopecia,miliary dematitisanderythema andoedema oftheface,ears andeyelids
associatedwith other EGC lesions.
Thc age of the cat is important,with genetic forms appearing in animals of lessthan 2ears.
Clinical examination

The lesion is suficiently characteristic for a diagnosis to be made.If the ulcer is not associated with
other EGClesions butisassociatedwith seasonal exccssivc grooming ormiliary dermatitisan

also with allergy to acroallergcns and food items.
Eosinophilicplaque
In areas most commonly affected (abdomen,thighs),clinical diagnosis is straightforward and can be
confirmed by cytology (presence of eosinophils) (Fig. 12 : 22).
The aim of the clinical examination is to find other lesional types.If the plaque is associated with

Treatment
Treatment has often been limited to the use of anti-inflammatory drugs without taking into account the
aetiology and the possibility of treating thecause25
Aetiology-based treatment
Aetiology-based treatment is essential and reduces the frequency of recurrence.It is based on
draconian fleacontrolmeasures forflea allergydermatitis,a hypoallcrgcnic dietforfoodintolerance
and possibly immunotherapy foratopic dermatitis
Symptomatictreatment
Symptomatic treatment is always necessary whether ornot a cause has been demonstrated.
Corticosteroids represent the most widely used first line of treatment in the form of
methylprednisolone acetate,given by intramuscular injection (4 mg/kg repcated evcry 2 to3weeks
and given a maximumof3times)or oral prednisoneor prednisolone(1-3mg/kgSIDfor4weeks and
thcn on alternate days)
Antibioticsmaybeusedinthe symptomatictreatment of indolentulcerswhichrespondwell to the
following antimicrobial agents:trimethoprim sulphur(30mg/kg BID),ccphalcxin(20mg/kgBID),
doxycycline (10 mg/kg SID) and clavulanic acid-potentiated amoxycillin (12.5 mg/kg BID).
Antibiotics should certainly be given as a first line of treatment and even constitute a long-term
solution which is preferable to giving corticosteroids.Response of some ulccrs to antibiotics does not

Auto-immune dermatoses
Auto-immune dermatoses are rare.Thcy arc characterised immunologically by the deposition of auto-
antibodics at various levels of the epidermispemphigus）and basement membrane (bullous pemphigoid）or
immune complexes within the basement menbrane (lupus erythematosus).An undcrstanding of them is
important as theyenterintothedifferential diagnosisofmany different conditions.The pemphigus complex
consists of several forms:pemphigus vulgaris(PV),pemphigus foliaceus(PF) and pemphigus erythematosus
(PE).PEcould be abenignformofPFora formintermediatebetween pemphigus andlupus erythematosus
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) has just recently been identified in the catDiscoid lupus erythematosus and

dermatoses are seen more often in middle-aged and older cats 12
The antigensresponsible are desmosomal glycoproteins of the cadherin group of intercelular
adhesionmolecules In dogs,the desmosomal cadherin involved in PF is desmoglein 1 Dsg1,
molecular weight 148-150kD).In man and the dog,the antigen involved in PV is desmoglein 3
(Dsg 3molecular weight 130kD）.In the cat,the target antigens have not yet been characterised,
but are most likely to be similar in origin and molecular weight.Desmogleins are associated with
a desmosomal plaque protein called plakoglobin which plays an important role in cellular
adhesion.There sccms to be aheterogeneity in the composition of desmosomes at different levels
of the epidermis,which could explain why acantholysis （the process associated with loss of
desmosomal cohesion) occurs suprabasally in PV and relatively morc superficially in PF.
Antibody binding is sccn at all levels of the epidermis in all forms of pemphigus.Antibodies
could provoke cell separation in the area where the target antigen is themain adhesionmolecule
The trigger factors are not clearly established. Immunogcnctic studies in man have shown an
association betwecn pemphigus and major histocompatibility complex HLA-DR4. It is well
established that drugs with a sulphydryl group may directly trigger acantholysis.Ageing and
alterationof theimmunesystemalsocontribute todevelopmcntofaulo-immunedisease throughloss
of tolerancc toauto-antigens and throughcross-antigenicitybetween these auto-antigens andextermal

BP has recently been reported in two adult cats, one a European, the other a Himalayan
Immunological studieshavedemonstratedthe presenceofIgGauto-antibodiesbothinthe serumand

collagcn XVII, of molecular weight 180 kD. Collagen XVII is a major constituent of

Lupus erythematosus
In lupus crythcmatosus (LE),tissue damage is the result of the deposition of type II immune
complexes in the epidermal basement membrane and other organs (in the systemic form)a.Both
systemic (SLE) and cutaneous (discoid -DLE) forms of the disease are rare. No age or sex

Uluraviolct (UV) rays,live attenuated viral vaccines and genetic factors could be predisposing
However,only the influence of UV light hasbcen demonstrated 27.UVrays could provoke cellular
lesions withenhancedexpression of intercellular adhesionmolecule1(ICAM-1)and auto-antigens

responsible forvasculitislesions seenin the kidneys andother organs.

Abdominal radiography does not identify the primary pancreatic tumour,although localised
mineralisation of the duodeno-pancreatic region can be seen.Radiographs of the lungs may
demonstrate possible Imetastasis.
Ultrasoundscanningallowspancrcaticandbiliarytuourstobevisualisedandespeciallyhepat
and biliarymetastases.This procedure requires excellent quality equipment (7.5MHzor10 MHz)
and anexperiencedoperator.Anultrasound-guidedneedle aspiratemay suggest theoriginof the
tumour.
CT scanning of the abdomen isveryuseful in demonstrating the tumour and its metastases.
Necropsy generallyrevealsneoplasiawhichhas alreadymetastasised totheliver,peritoneum and
lungs (Fig.14:6).The primary tumour is often a pancreatic,or more rarely a biliary,
adenocarcinoma
The differential diagnosis must include spontancous and iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome,causes of
symmetrical alopecia,telogeneffluvium and superficial necrolytic dermatitis.
Prognosis - Treatment
The prognosis is very poor. In the absence of visible metastasis onradiography and ulrasoundan
pancreatectomy,withimprovcmcnt in general condition and hairregrowth has been seen, confirming
the paraneoplastic nature of the cutaneous lesionsAll other cases reported have diedvery soon after
diagnosis,due to thegeneralised distributionof the tumour
Superficial necrolytic dermatitis
A dermatosis resembling superficial necrolytic dermatitis (SND) in the dog has recently been described in two
female,1-year old cats,inrelation to a pancreatic tumour,one with and one without metastasis.
Dermatologicalsignswere characterised byalopecianon-ruritic erythemaerosions and crusts.In
one case,the dorsal skin was thickened and fissures seen over the thoraxIn the other case,the
alopecic skin was shiny around the axillae°
Histopathology ofskin biopsies revealed lesions compatiblewith SND sccn in othcr spccics(man,
dog) andwas characterised by parakeratotic hyperkeratosis and intraepidermal oedema.
Necropsyinbothcasesrevealeda pancreatic adenocarcinoma,onewithoutmetastasisand the other
with hepatic and mesentericmetastasis 
The many similarities between SND and PPA suggest that these two dermatoses could be dermatological
cxpressions of the same pathological process.
Acquired cutaneous hyperfragility syndrome
fragility leading to skin thinning and spontaneousnon-haemorrhagic andnon-painful tearing
Aetiopathogenesis
ACHS is oftenidiopathic,although theunderlying cause must alwaysbelookedfor and treatedwhcrc
possible.Underlying causes include spontaneous Cushing's syndrome (very rare in the cat)
iatrogenic Cushing'ssyndrome caused byexcessive use of corticosteroids(rare)or megestrol acetate
predilection has been reported.
Pathogenesis is unknown. Severe metabolic disorders could exacerbate a subclinical cutaneous
asthenia and thus trigger ACHS.

Paraneoplastic exfoliative dermatitis
Aetiopathogenesis
Paraneoplasticexfoliative dermatitis(PED)is a dermatological paraneoplastic syndrome associated
with development of a thymoma o. Regression of skin lesions after removal of the tumour confirms
the paraneoplastic nature of the dermatosis.PED is seen mainly in adult or agcd cats (older than 10
years. No breed or sex predilection has been reported.
The pathogenesis is not clearly understood. In man, there are many paraneoplastic immunological
syndromes associated with thymomas but it is only recently that an exfoliative dermatitis has been

Skin tumours
Tumours of the skin and its adnexae are some of the most diverse and common tumours seen in the cat.Such
a largevariety ispossible because the skin ismadeup of lots of diffcrcnt componcnts,cach ofwhich can
potentially form a tumour.We can therefore see epithelial tumours which involve the malpighian laycr,thc
adnexal sebaceous or sweat glands and hair follicles; tumours of the melanin synthesising system;
mesenchymal tumours developing in the dermis or subcutaneous connective tissue;tumours derived from
lymphoid tissue; and finally,nerve and vascular tumours.The majority of skin tumours in thc cat are primary,
with secondary tumours occurring muchmore rarely. Skin tumours make up 20 to30% of all tumours (only
lymphoid tumours aremore common).Their highincidenceismatched by their severitywith theratioof
malignant to benign tumours being 3:1 in the cat and only 1:2 in the dog.Although epithclial and mesenchymal
tumours are equallyrepresented,thedifferent typesof tumourdonotoccur at the samefrequency.Four of them,
squamouscellcarcinoma,basalcelltumour,fibrosarcoma andmastcell tumour,makeup about70%ofskin
tumours in the cat.The relative frequencyof these four types of tumour is currcntly changing.Although

Feline fibrosarcoma complex
Epidemiology
Tumours belonging to the“feline fibrosarcoma complex”are currently the most common tumours in
thc cat (12 to 41% of skin tumours)i23. In France, the average age of cats with fibrosarcoma is 9.6
years,butwith a 95%confidence interval of3.2 to16years,an unusually wide range fornaturally
occurring tumours.The age of catswith fibrosarcoma has sometimes been shown tohave a bimodal
distribution,with one peakseen ataround6 or7yearsofage and a second peak ataround10 or11
yearsHowcvcr,thc age rangc of cats with injection site fibrosarcomas is significantly vcry diffcrent
to that ofcats which developfibrosarcomas at siteswhere injections arenot normallygiven.
Aetiology
The aetiologyof felinefibrosarcomas hasbeen amatter of great controversy due to the suggestion
that vaccination injectionsmight increase the relative risk of developing a fibrosarcoma s.This
theory is bascd on:
epidemiologicaldatashowinganincreaseintheincidenceoffelinefibrosarcomascorrelatedwiththe
frequency ofvaccinations (in particular the anti-rabies vaccination); alowering of the ageof catswith
fibrosarcoma; and a change in the sites affected by the tumour previously the distal limbs and head,

beeneliminated following a study involving a series ofinjection site fibrosarcomas inwhich these
oncogcnes were undetected by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).
On the other hand, a rare form of viral-induced multicentric fibrosarcoma occurs.This fibrosarcoma
is caused by the FesV virus which mainly affects young animals. FesV is defective in genes
FeLVvirus (cats withviral-induced fibrosarcoma must have been infected by FeLV ).
Clinical features
Tunours of thefelinefibrosarcoma group”arecharacterised clinicallyby subcutaneousfirm,
nodular or multi-nodularlesions.They are non-painful (except when very large and/or have infiltrated
into deeper structures) and initially non-ulcerated (Figs 15:17-21).They occur most commonly at
injection sites: the interscapular region,dorsal neck, thorax,lumbar region and thighs (Figs 15:19
21).Involvement of the face and distal limbs, previously deseribed as classic,is now rare (Figs 15:
17,18).The speed of development of fibrosarcomas isvery variable.Nodules canremain small for a
very long time or may rapidly double in size.It seems that this growth may accelerate in line with the
number of surgical excisions7.28
Granulomatous panniculitis is a non-neoplastic lesion,seenusually in the weeks following a
vaccination or otherinjection.Injections of anti-rabies vaccineorlong-acting therapeutic agents are
most commonly involved. Clinically,it is characterised by the sub-acute or chronic development of
an erosive or ulcerated, painful area at injection sites, particularly in the interscapular region 2

Malignantfibroushistiocytomas(MFIl)
Malignant fibrous histiocytomas make up about 60%of the tumours of the feline fibrosarcoma
complexThese tumours areverypolymorphi,withdifferences ccurring notonly between tumours
but alsowithin the same tumour.MFHs are charactcrised by the combined presenceofmesenchymal
and histiocytic neoplastic cellswithin a relatively abundant collagen stroma.Sub-types of MFH have
been recognised in relation to the presence of multinucleated giant cells (MFH with giant cells) or
abundant myxoid stroma.
Fibromatoses
Fibromatoses are subcutaneous mesenchymal tumours characterised by well-differentiated
fibroblastic proliferation associated with a dense collagenous stroma.Unlike in true fibrosarcomas,

Many other mesenchynal tumours occur subcutancously in the cat:undifferentiated sarcomas.
osteosarcomas,chondrosarcomas,haemangiosarcomas,rhabdomyosarcomas,haemangiopericytomas
and neurofibrosarcomas.These tumours are generally more similar in biological behaviour to the
feline fibrosarcoma complex than their names would suggest. For example, subcutaneous
haemangiosarcomas in cats metastasise no more than malignant ibrous histiocytomasand in any
case,much less than splenic haemangiosarcomas.Some anaplastic carcinomas can resemble
undiffcrentiated sarcomas due to the fusiform appearance of their cells. Only immunostaining
techniques with anti-cytokeratin and anti-vimentin antibodies will characterise prcciscly thc
embryonic origin of tumour cells.In essence,immunostaining of carcinomas is cytokeratin positive
and vimentin negative,whileimmunostaining of sarcomas is cytokeratin negative and vimentin
positive.Othermonoclonalantibodies can then beused to etermine more precisely the phenotype.

Treatment
Therapy is based on verywide surgical excision sometimes associated with other local or general
treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapyrespectively.Locally aggressive tumours require a
combination of surgcry and radiotherapy in order to reduce local recurrence. The aim of
chemotherapyis tolimit distant metastases.Immunogenotherapyisstill experimental but preliminary
results are encouraging.
Surgery
Surgery is still the main treatment for feline fibrosarcomas.Early intervention andwide surgical
removal will be difficult and therefore probably incomplete.Best results are obtained on tumours

Mast cell tumour
Mast cell tumours arise from the many mast cells present in the dermis.Less prevalent than in the dog. thcy
Visceral mast cell tumours are also seen.
Epidemiology-Aetiology
Mast cell tumours occur mostlyin older cats(9years old,on average)withoutanybreed or sex
predisposition.There secms tobe noassociationbetweccncutaneous andvisccral formswhich usually
develop separately.A“histiocytic”mast cell tumour has been described in young Siamese cats(aged
less than 4 years).Their aetiology is unknown”.
Clinical features
Clinically,mastocytimastcelltumoursareusuallycharacterisedbyasingle,firmwell-delineated

15:23).Multicentric forms are seen （Fig.15:24).The“histiocyticmast cell tumour, scen in the
Siamese,often consists of several largemasses on the head and neck.

be aggressive whereas others see them as carrying a more favourable prognosis. The “histiocytic

Formultiple well-differentiatedmast cell tumours,palliative excision can be performed on lesions
whose growth wouldnot be satisfactorily checked by medical treatment (corticosteroids and
vincristine).
For recurrcnt and/or large tumours,radiotherapyhas been shown to be effective when used alongside
surgery and chemotherapy.

Genetic hypermelanoses
Lentigines are circumscribed hypermelanoses associatedwith an increasednumber of epidermal
melanocytes. Clinically, a lentigine is a uniform brown or black macule, varying from 1-10 mm in
diameter (Fig. 16 :17). Ginger cats often havc multiplc lentigines around the mucocutaneous
junctions of the face (lips,nosc and cyelids),referred to collectively as lentigo simplex(Fig.16:

eventually coalescing

8kittens,two of which presented with skin and mucous mcmbranc lesions from the agc of 10 wceks.
Both parents were normal. Skin lesions are characterised by footpad ulceration,multiple

Hereditary cutaneous asthenia
Hereditary cutaneous asthenia refers to a group of genetic abnormalities of collagen fibres (Ehlers-Danlos
Syndromc (EDS)and elastin fibres(CutisLaxa),characterised clinically by changes in the texture,elasticity
and resistance of the skin. These conditions are extremely rare in the cat.
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)
Aetiopathogenesis
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)is better known by the name dermatosparaxis(which means that skin
can be ton）,but this term actually designates one particular type of EDS,characterised by an
recessive trait.In the cat,two types ofEDShavebeen reported.The extremely rareform,inherited as a
recessive trait,has been described in the Himalayan breed and is similar toEDsVIlcinman and
form inherited as a dominant trait  results from a biochemical defect referred to as type EDS I-III and
has not yet been characterised.No breed predispositionhas been observed.
Clinicalfeatures
cats,less than oneyear old,and involve increased elasticity and extensibility of the skin(Figs16:
21.22)and,in some cases,spontaneous skin tearing.These tears donot bleed much(Figs 16:23.24)
but heal with scarring.Sometimes,the skin feels very thin.
Non-dermatologicalsignsobservedin the dog,have,to date,notbeen described in thecat
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on the history, clinical appearance of the lesions, measurement of the skin
extensibilityindex,and skin biopsies taken for conventional histopathological and ultrastructural
examination.Although clinical diagnosis is easy in severe cases,it can be much more difficult in
milder cases.
The differential diagnosis should include other causes of acquired cutaneous hyperfragility (e.g.
hyperadrenocorticism,hepatic chlolangiocarcinoma,hepatic lipidosis.etc...)
Histopathologyof skinbiopsiesrevealsqualitative andquantitative abnormalitiesof dermal collagen
fibres:very thin dermismplantation of hair folliclesin the hypodermisbundesof loose,sparse
collagen fibres (Fig.16:25);or compact, ense,diluted or smaller collagen fibres Although
abnormal collagenfibres in the dog sometimes lose their affinityfor trichrome stains（e.g.Massons

This index is not very reliable.In the cat,themaximum EI tolerated is 19%.The index depends on
of the investigator and the degree of musclerelaxation in anaesthetised or non-anaesthetised animals.
Prognosisandtreatment

other species .This could be linked to the relatively fewer abnormal collagen fibres resulting from

Histopathological examinationof skin biopsiesrevealsavery acanthotic epidermiswith discrete

Prognosis must be guarded givcn the chronic evolution of the dermatosis.
Treatment with both oral antihistamines(e.g.hydroxyzine 2mg/kgTID)and corticosteroids(e.g.
prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg BID) given orally, gives inconsistent results . Recently, the use of
cyclasporin (7.5 mg/kg SID) given orally, two hours either side of food, produced definite regression
of signs within 3weeks.The frequency of administration was then altered to every 2or3 days,
depending on the appearance of skin lesions.No side-effects were seen during this treatment (E
Guaguere,personal observations,1999).

Neurophysiology
The central nervous system is responsible for organising and assimilating. and adapting an individual to its
surroundings.A continuous flow of information circulates along neurones in the form of electrical impulses,
trigered by chemicals calld neurotransmitters,released at the level of the synaptic cleftThe principal
neurotransmiters involved in displaccment activilics andstereotypicbchaviour are:scrotonin,dopamine,
noradrenalin,peptides (such as endorphins) and the gamma amino butyric acid complex(GABA)6
Dopamine regulatesmotor andmuscular activity,arousal and aggression.It is involved in anticipation
(beingina stat of readinesstoact),collatinginfornationandstop signals”Toomuch opanine
leads to stereotypic behaviour. Signs suggesting dopamine overactivity include ptyalism,large
intestinal diarrhoea,anticipation and aggression.Those suggesting dopamine underactivity are
inhibition (mechanism within nervous system which pcrinits blocking of transmission of information
orresponse,ladingtoinabilityof animal toreact),reduced sleep,abnormal feedinghabitand
displacement activities.
Noradrenalin and adrenalin are the modulators of vigilance （taking in information from the
environment) and sensitivity of the organism tochangesinthe environmcnt.Tachycardia,tachypnoea,
emotional urination and hypervigilance (constantly responding to all information in the environment)
arc suggestive of noradrenalinoveractivity,which is often involved in early anxiety states.

Focalalopecia
When licking or sucking is confined to well-demarcated parts of the body,alopecia may be seen in
various places.Preerred sites include the fore limbs (Figs 17:7-9), tail,(Fig.17:10), trunk (Figs
17:11-12) and dorsally betwcen thc shoulder blades (Fig.17: 13）.These lesions can assume the

thickening and ulceration(Fig.17:17).These lesions do not seem to be restricted to one particular
sideStereotypic licking of the nose can produce erosions sometimes triangular-shaped,on the
nasal planum oronthe undersurface of theupper lip(Figs 17:18-20).The liplesionsmay develop
into indolent ulcers (Fig.17: 21).
Excoriations
Excoriations brought about by scratching and biting can look like real self-mutilation and the
spectacular consequences (e.g.necrosis,ulceration and crusting) are often shocking to cat owners.
Excoriations are localised to the face and neck （scratching)(Fig.17:22),limbs (biting)and tail
(scratching and biting)(Fig.17 : 23) 21.

Diagnosis
History
Getting a good history from the owners is critical.This should be as detached as possible and not
be cmbroiled in the owners'own interpretations of events （e.g.“he knows he's doing wrong,he's
bored,he's jealous,he's getting his own back etc.).Information on the type of dwelling （e.g.flat
orhouse),number of animals and other species in the household,and the make upof the family
may reveal if the animal's surroundings are conducive to having a healthy emotional state.Thc
history should highlight all the environmental changes that occurred before the appearance of skin
signsswellasthepatenof thebehaviouraldisorderielfhebhavioufthcatwithints
environment should also be considered: behaviours which affect the cat itself (e.g.feeding and
drinkingbehaviour,touch,excretorybehaviourandsleep)and thosewhich affect theinteractionof
the cat with the environment (e.g. aggression, exploration and marking) *. Sometimes, owners do
not see the animal licking. Carrying out a trichogram is the only way to prove that the alopecia is
traumaticinoriginLack of improvementineithercutaneous orbehavioural signsafter ug
treatment of any sort, is of no diagnostic value.Equally,the efficacy of corticosteroids or synthetic
progestagens cannot be used to conclude that a hypersensitivity skin disease is present.This is
especially truewithmegoestrol acetate,which has marked neuroleptic activity.Noris the efficacy
of certain psychotropic drugs of any diagnostic value,as some of them have sedative or
antihistamine action
Clinicalexamination
Diagnosing cutaneous signs as manifestations of a behavioural disorder is often troublcsoinc
becausescignsarmostlyn-spificvcn thoughsomuhasslfduced alopeciaail
chewing and tailmutilation are strongly suggestive.The presence ofpruritusisverydifficult to
evaluate because an increase in grooming activity may be the only means by which the cat can get
relief20
A general examination will reveal concurrent diseases along with organic and dermatological
manifestations of displacement activities.Organic manifestations may be direct (e.g.tachycardia,
tachypnoca,ptyalism,diarrhoea and emotional urination) or indircct (c.g. obcsity).
Valuable information can be obtained from the demeanour of the cat during the consultation.
or “non-productive” conditions (e.g. permanent anxiety and depression).
Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes all the pruritic, parasitic and allergic dermatoses .The
diagnostic approach is complex in the cat becausc bchavioural disorders can oftcn be associated with
chroni,ruriticskinconditionsespeciallyhypersensitivity
Additionaltests
The purpose of carrying out additional tests (e.g.a trichogram) is two fold: 1) to demonstratc that the
alopecia is traumatic in origin and 2) to eliminate ectoparasitism and allergy as differentials.
Behavioural diagnosis
The diagnosis ofacule behavioural disorders posesfewproblems.The diagnosis of anxiety,on the
difficult.Perimanent anxiety is actuallywell-tolerated by owners,whofind their catsvery calm.
Owners,here,cope well with the alopecia which they perceive only as being unattractive.
Diagnosing cutaneous disease as a manifestation of a behavioural disorder is still too often a
diagnosisofexclusionndeedalastchancediagnosisafterall tests andtherapeutic trialshav
been carried out. In a good number of cases,after carrying out basic dermatological and
behavioural investigations,a behavioural association should be suspected quite early on.

Treatment
Two types of therapy are used in the treatment of behavioural disorders: psychotropic drugs and“ccological
therapy. Physical devices such as Elizabethan collars and bandages produce only temporary remission and can
agravateanaleadystongyisorlrd motional stateThyareoweverometmeunavoidableat 
start of treatment in the case of very severe skin lesions.
Psychotropic drugs
Until recently.the choice of psychotropic agents was restricted to neuroleptics (dopamine
antagonists) such as haloperidol or acepromazine,and anxiolytics (acting on GABA) such as
diazepam.Rcccnt advances in veterinary psychiatry haveled to the development of effective,more
convenient treatments with a minimum ofundesirable side-effects (extra-pyramidal synrdromc for
neuroleptics; disinhibition,memory difficulties and developing a tendency to bite for the
benzodiazcpines) 2
Anxiolyticagents
The drug used is trioxazine(whereavailable)(20mg/kg/dayintwodosesfor2-3months）.Trioxazine
has a veryrapid onset ofaction(3-5 days)and isnon-sedating,but as its anxiolytic actionisstrongly

to cats with a history of aggression.It can be used right at the start or at the end of treatment as a
change from othertherapies.The treatment can be given over a long period but a rapid onset of action
shouldbe seen.Awithdrawal period of one weekfor every3weeks of treatment is advised .2s
Modulatorsof thenoradrenalinsystem
Modulators of the noradrenalin system can be prescribcd in carly anxiety problemswith

behavioural dermatoses.The only drug availableisselegiline chlorhydratewhichactsonthe three

Antidepressants
Antidepressants,generally,are serotoninreuptake inhibitors.However,theirmode of actionis
complexandnot limited to just onemediator.
Clomipramine,acting onthe noradrenalin and serotonin systems,is a peripheral and central
anticholinergicagent.It improvesmood and sleep pacrns and stimulates a returnto exploratory
activity. It possesses anxiolytic and sedative properties.Clomipramine is indicated in problems of
anxiety or depression, accompanied by displacement activity The dose is 0.3-0.8mg/kg SID given
once orin two divided doses.Itsbeneficial action can be seen from the tenth daybut this may be
precededby a detcrioration.A reductionin lickingoccurs on average within 25 daysTreatment can

History
Thehistory canidentify various risk factors(Table 19:2) and help steer the clinician towards a differential
diagnosis. Important factors to ardress arc :
hypotrichosiswhichis a localised or total loss ofhair,sometimes associatedwith other ectodermal
disorders affecting whiskers,claws and teeth.Generalised congenital hypotrichosis,referred to as
alopecia universalis,has been described in the Sphinx(Fig.19:1).Abyssinian cats sometimes
present withcongenitalstructural disordersof thehairshaftaffecting thewhiskersand primaryhairs
which fracture at the site of onion-shaped swellingsGenetic follicular dysplasiahasbeen described
in the Cornish Rex 1.Persians are particularly predisposed to dermatophytosis caused by
Microsporum canis(Fig.19:2).Self-induced symmetrical alopecia of behavioural origin is more
common in Siamese (Fig.19: 3),Abyssinian and Burmese breeds²
hypotrichosisEqually,pili torti isa congenital structural disorderof the hair shaft,reportedin
kittens.This syndrome,whichaffectssecondaryhairs only,ischaracterised bylattening androtation
of thehairshaft,exccssivefragility andfracture.Affected kittens alsoprescnt with pododermatitis and
paronychiaInanykittenwithfocalormultifocalalpeciadematophytosis should esuspected
In a young adult, aged between 8 months and 3years, alopecia can be self-inflicted and a direct
consequence of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis,Tumours, paraneoplastic alopecia and
endocrinopathies affect mostly older cats.
Lifestyleandenvironment:catslivingtogetheringroupsbreedingcoloniesorrescueprmisesare
predisposed to contagious dermatoses:dermatophytosisdue toMicrosporum canis andpruritic
ectoparasitic infestations which cause self-induced alopecia.These cats are alsomore exposed toflea
infestationsand therefore moreinclined to develop symmetrical alopeciarelatedtoflea allergy
dermatis (Fig19 : 4).Flea allcrgy dermalitis is the mos common dermatosis in the cat and must
always be considered in the differential diagnosis not only of the pruritic dermatosis but also of
alopecia

animalorchild)shoudalwaysbeinvestigated,giventheirroleinsomecasesofself-inducedalopecia.
gastrointestinal signs (e.g.anorexia and vomiting) often precedes the appearance of skin lesions
Circumstances surroundingdevelopment of theclinical signs:livingwith other cats(e.g.in shows
or cattcries) favours development of dermatophytosis or pruritic ectoparasitic infestations which

dermatitis.
Initial distributionofthedermatosisshouldbe ascertained,asmanytypesofalopeciahave
preferential distribution sites.
The efficacy of prior therapy should be evaluated and dosages and duration of treatment checked.
Response to corticosteroids is good for self-induced alopecia arising from flea allergy dermatitis,
atopic dermatitis and early food intolerance;it is partial or poor in long-standing food intolerance and
behavioural disorders.In the cat,it is alsoimportant tocheckfor possibledevelopment of atrophic
circumscribed alopecia at the site of injection of corticosteroid or synthetic progestagens (Fig. 19 : 7)
and also for extensive atrophic alopecia associated with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome (Fig.19: 8).
Flea control strategies must be critically and rigorously assessed.

hypotrichosis .Erythema and scaling are common and can have a focal distribution in
dermatophytosis, a dorsal distribution in cheyletiellosis (Fig. 19 : 9) and a rather generalised
distribution in cutaneousTcellepitheliotropic lymphoma (Fig.19:16).In this lastcase,thehair loss
is due to the neoplastic infiltrate obliterating the pilo-sebaceous adnexac.Parancoplastic alopccia is
characterised bya particularly shiny appearance to the skin,mainlyaffecting abdomen and limbs

History
The history directs the clinician towardscertain differential diagnoses and is a criticalpart of the diagnostic
process 14. Important points to consider are :
Breed:dermatophytosisis particularly common inPersians andin long-hairedcatsgenerally.Inthese
breeds,dermatophytosis should always be suspectedwhen crusts are present (Fig.20:4).
Ageofonsetofclnicalsigns:kitensandyoungadultsarepredisposedtoectoparasiticinfestations
（e.g.cheyletiellosis,Otodectesinfestation and demodicosis）,dermatophytosisand allergic dcratitis
whereas oldcr animals are more susceptible to auto-immune dermatoses (Fig.20:5)and tumours
(e.g.mycosis fungoides)(Fig.20: 6).
Animal'slifestyleand environment:cats thatarefree toroam,and thercforc in contact with othcr
cats,often present with dermatophytosis and various ectoparasitic infestations. Cats kept together
（e.g.in catteries or shows)are more susceptible to dermatophytosis and cheyletiellosis.Contact with
wild rodents predisposes hunting cats to poxvirus infection.
Possibilityoftransmissionbetweencatsandalsobetweencats,dogsandpeoplemust bethoroughly
investigatdtparasitstatinailarlnvlvinChtlldecteyt
fleasand dermatophyteinfectionwithMicrosporum canis shouldbe suspected
Presence of pruritus prior to lesions points lowards an allcrgic dermatosis or possibly an
ectoparasiticinfestation.Dermatophyte infections are not pruritic except for some inflammatory
forms.
Prior treatments should be itemised to cstablish or cxclude the possibilityof a cutaneous drug
reaction.Response to prior therapy can be animportant factor in the diagnosisas themajority of
inflammatory non-infectious dermatoses respond wellto moderate doses of corticosteroids.However,
lack of efficacy ofsuch treatment hasnodiagnosticvalue,given thepossibility of inadequatedosing
and uncertain compliance.
Clinical examination

History
The history directs the clinician towardscertaindiferential diagnoses andisa critical part of the diagnostic
process. Important points to consider are:
Age of onset of clinical signs: kittens and young adults are predisposed to genodermaloses (e.g.
junctional and dystrophic epidermolysisbullosa,andcutaneous asthenia）.Older cats aremorelikely
to present with auto-immune skin conditions or tumours.
Animals lifestyleandenvironment:cats that arefree toroamorliveoutdoorsarevulncrable to
actinic dmatosesandoregenerally,environmental traumaburnrostittc.）In m
cases,ownersreport spontaneouslyalinkbetween trauma anddevelopment of lesions.Aggressive
cats aremorelikelytohavebites andfightwoundsCats that liveinrural surroundings andhunt
wild rodents are predisposed to poxvirus infection

respectively. Ectoparasitic infestations (e.g.notoedric mange,cheyletiellosis and Otodectes
infestation) are often contagious and manifest as erosive or ulcerativelesions.
Pruritus andits associationwith the developmentoferosive orulcerativelesions:severepruritusis
often the sole cause of such dermatological lesions incats.Some very pruritic dermatoses(e.g.atopic

scratching and biting which can produce extremely severe crosivc or ulcerativelesions (Fig.21:4).

Clinical examination

ulcerative dermatoses,which are infactmerely dermatological manifestations of systemic disease.

Feline infectious peritonitis sometimes causes ulcers in thin-skinned areas (e.g.pinnal margins),due
tovasculitis.In addition to the systemic signs seenin Cushing's syndrome（arare disease in cats),the
epidermis becomes extremely thin,leading sometimes to severe skin fragility.Ulcerative lesions on
the face,limbs and perianal region haverecentlybeen reportedin a catwith paraneoplastic syndrome
linked to a pancreatic tumour'.
Dermatological examination allows the clinician to identify lesions and to establish thein
distribution.

feline epidermis is so thin.Thcir rupture is responsible for the development of erosions and ulcers.
Purpuric macules associated with punched-out cutaneous ulcers require investigation for fcline

considerable,it ishelpful tohave anidea of theresistance and elasticityof theskin.Measurement of

forgetting however,the importance of parasites as a cause of feline otitis externa.
History
The history directs the clinician towards certain differential diagnoses and is a critical part of the diagnostic
process Important points to consider are :
Ageofonset ofclinicalsigns:otoacariasis,causedbyOtodectescynotis,isseenparticularlyinyoung
cats aged less than a year(Fig.22:1). On the other hand, an erythemato-ceruiminous otitis externa in
an adult cat ismore suggestive of an allergic dermatitis （Fig.22:2）.A purulent otitis in an old cat
strongly suggests an auto-immune dermatosis(Fig.22:3）or a tumour of the external auditory canal
(Fig. 22 : 4).

Animal'swayof life andenvironment:catsthat liveoutdoorsaremore susceptibletoOtodectes
infestation or otitis externa causedby a foreignbody.Excessive humiditycan alsolead tomaceration
in the ear.
Transnissionbetweencats andalso between catsand dogs suggests Otodectesinfestation.The

Recent systemic illnesses should be noted. For example,herpesvirus infection may trigger
generalised erythemamultiforme,withfrequentinvolvcmcnt of faccand ears（Fi.22:5).
Theefficacyofpriortherapyshouldbeevaluatedalongwiththepossibilitythatopicalmedications
maybecausingiritant orallergicreactionsFig22:6）Itis alsomortant tofindout howthwer
is clcaning the ears andapplying the topicalmedication,as repeated trauma is an aggravating factor.
Clinical examination
Clinical signs of otitis externa are quite characteristic:facerubbing（caused by pruritus in the ear),scratching,
head shaking or aggressivereactions,sharp pain and unplcasant smell-
General clinical examinationisconcerncd particularlywithneurological consequences ofotitis
externa（e.g.vestibular rlabyrinthine syndrome)Fig22:7）.Incasesofchronic suppurativeotitis,
tcsting for retroviruses should be routine.Some systemic illnesses such as thymoma-associated
paraneoplastic exfoliative dermatismay causc scaling on the pinnae (Fig.22:8).Erythematous,
scaling lesions are not uncommonly seen on the ears of cats with epitheliotropic lymphoma (Fig. 22
degenerativemucinouslymphocyticmural folliculitis.
General dermatologicalexamination isan essential stepin the aetiological diagnosis ofotitis
externaListingthegeneral dermatologicallesionsandnoting theirdistributionwillhelptoidentify
the underlying dermatosis. This can thcn be confirmed by appropriate diagnostic tests.
Auricular examination involves thc pinnac (medial and lateral surfaces),the area behind the ears
(Fig.22:11)where basic lesions （e.g.erythema,pustules,nodules,erosions,ulcers and crusts) can
be identified,and theentranceto theearcanals.Thehealthierear should beexamined first,followed
bythemor anful datinrvn hrt-ating nralanathtimtimeay

presence of abnormal quantities of secrction can be detccted by close inspection.Auricular
examinationwill allow anerythemato-ceruminous otitis(ECO) tobedistinguished from a suppurative
otitis (SO) .ECO is much more common than SO in the cat 
Erythemato-ceruminous otitis:erythema is associatedwith excessive secretion of thick cerumen.
The appearance of the secretion isvariable.It can be brown,blackish and ry,orbrown,light and
thick(Figs 22:12-14).Pruritus is oftenmarked.ECO is usually bilateral.Aetiologically,parasitic and
non-parasitic causes of ECO should be distinguished.

Pruritus and pain,in particular,can trigger scratching andabnormalhead shaking.leading frequently
to scaling and alopecic lesions on the pinnac,and somctimes an aural haematoma or pyotraumatic
dermatosis (Fig.22:16).The pinnae are often oedematous. SO is unilateral in 50% of cases

History
The history helps to steer the clinician towards particular differentials.Itis a vital step in the diagnostic process.
Important points to consider are:
Breed:Persians are prcdisposcd to dermatophytosis.In theBirman,claws are absent or rudimentary
in congenital hypotrichosis(Fig.24:2).The Siamese breed is predisposed to vitiligo which will
often affect the feet(depigmentation of the footpads (Fig. 24: 3）), and more rarely junctional
epidermolysis bullosa'.
Ageofonset:development of pedal lesionsinacatunder6monthswoul suggest dermatophytosis,
calicivirus),or a genodermatosis(e.g.junctionaland dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa,congenital
hypotrichosis and pili torti.Pedal lesions in ayoung adult would initially suggest dermatophytosis
crythematosus （Fig.24:10)),dermatoses associated with systemic disease(e.g. superficial

Clinical examination
Theclinical examination is thecentral part of thediagnostic approach to pododermatoses.
The general clinical examination is concerned principally with signs associatedwith atopy (e.g.
conjunctivitis,rhinitis and asthmatic bronchitis),signs of general ill-hcalth associatedwith a high
temperature suggcsting aviralinfectionauo-immune diseaseoropportunisticinfctionassociated
with retroviral infection.The catmay have a cough relating to digital metastasis of a pulmonary

Zoonotic dermatoses
Zoonoses are defined as diseases and infections that are transmiednaturally from vertebrate animals toman
andviceversa(WHO definition,1967）.This definition is open to considerable criticism as it excludesparasitic
infestations and assumes reciprocal transmission.Some diseases,however, cannot be transmitted in both
directions.The term‘zoonotic dermatosesrefers to those zoonoscs in which the causal agent causes skin
lesionsinman.In the cat,theserepresent a small fraction of the200zoonosesrecognised todayin this species
Although signs are variable,the simultaneous appearance of lesions on the owner and his animal,or the
presenceonapersonof lesionsrestricted to areasofcontactwiththecatare stronglysuggestiveof azoonotic

susceptibility.Occasionally,theownermakes theconnectionbetween hisorher skinlesionsand those of their

Fungal dermatoses
Dermatophytosis
Derinatophytosisis a supcrficial mycosis caused by pathogenic,epidermotropic,keratinophilic and
keratolyticfungi called dermatophytes.Thecatisabove all,thevectorofMicrosporumcaniswhich
ishighly contagious toman.Transmission ismainlybydirect contact but can alsooccurbyindirect

transport cages).Mechanical asymptomatic carriage iscommon and estimated to occurin15-36%
of animals depending on their life style3.4.

Sporotrichosis
Sporotrichosisisadeepmycosishighlycontagioustomancausedbyaimorphicfungus,porothrix
schenckii.This infection should be suspected in cats with a non-healingwound or abscess following
theuseof appropriate antibiotics.Sporotrichosisis a serious zoonosis and individuals in direct contact
with soil andplants should be considered atrisk6.
Infectionin the catusually resultsfromwound contamination or penetration of a foreign body.More
rarely, inhalation of spores can cause systemic illness. Man usually becomes infected directly
following a bite or scratchbut infection can also ariseby direct contact with infected tissues orfluids
of affected cats.
Signs are identical to those described in the cat '.The incubation period is variable(3 weeks to3
Imonths）.The cutancolymphatic form is themost common（seen in 80%of cases),characterised by a
solitarynodule at the siteof infection.Thenodule,whicheventually ulceratesis typically seen on the
back of the hand (Fig.25:9),a finger,a toe,or the face.Othernodules may appear along lymphatic
vessels.The strictly cutancous form is identical to the feline condition.Thc rare systemic forin is
probably caused by spread of infective Sporothrix schencki spores via the blood. Usually,
sporotrichosis can be treated successfully in immunocompetent people but it can be fatal in the
immuinosuppressed.
Diagnosis is based on cytology,histopathology and fungal cultureIn man,diagnosing thc condition
Histoplasma capsulatum.
In the cat,in addition tosystemic antifungal treatment,hygienic measuresmust becarriedout.Hand
and arms must be thoroughly cleanedwith antifungal agents like chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine.
Wearing protective gloves is also rccommended. Owners must be informcd of the considerable
zoonoticrisk associated with this illness and euthanasia should be discussed for carrier cats because
treatment is long and the risk of transmission is high°.
Blastomycosis

in North Amcrica,but also in Africa and central America,with wcll-defined endemic foci.
Blastomycosis is a systemic illness seen in the dog and man,and rarelyin the cat.To date,no case
has been reported in Europe in the cat.Human infection can occur via wound contamination (bites
from infected animals;knives or needles contaminated by autopsy or aspirate).In addition to
characteristic pulmonarylesionsfollowinginhalationof sporesfrom the soil,skinlesions can occu
These may take theform ofpapules and abscesses or sometimesproliferative,crustingnoduleswith

（socks,belt,bra).They are characterised by very pruritic papules,sometimes urticarial plaqucs,
vesicles and secondary excoriations(Fig.25:15).
Thc cat flea is also the vcctor(for transmission between cats)of Bartonella henselae,theorganism that
causes cat scratch disease. The cat is therefore an asymptomatie carrier of this bacteria.Transmission to
man occurs mostlyvia a bite or scratch,but sometimes indirectly via flea faeces.Thetypical form is
characterised bythe devclopment,within3-10daysof a transient apular lsion at the siteof the scrath.
This is followed by marked regional lymphadenopathy within 2-3weeks (Fig.25:16).Cat scratch
