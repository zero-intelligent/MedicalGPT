Postoperative care
 The greatest postoperative concern, reportedly occurring
in 8-58% dogs (Berger & Feldman 1987; Ham et al.
2009), is hypocalcemia due to chronic suppression of the
remaining parathyroid glands through negative feedback
from the hypersecretory tumor. The suppressed glands
require 2-3 weeks to begin secreting PTH (Flanders
2003). The parathyroid glands optimize their response
to falling calcium levels by a phenomenon called
hysteresis, a mechanism that allows the glands to
 increase PTH secretion in response to decreasing plasma

during the arterial and pancreatic phases. Histologically,
canine insulinomas have been noted to be highly vascular,
and therefore the CT images are hyperattenuating at the
arterial phase, compared with normal pancreas. In all
dogs CTA findings were in agreement with the surgical
and histopathologic findings, suggesting CTA as an accu-
rate method for canine insulinoma detection.
Despite advancements in preoperative diagnostic
imaging modalities, exploratory laparotomy remains the
most reliable method of detecting primary and metastatic
insulinoma. Careful inspection and palpation of the
pancreas and adjacent structures, with or without the use of
intravenous methylene blue infusion (3 mg/kg, administered
over 30-40 min, for intraoperative staining), reveals most

Abdominal radiography
Abdominal radiography is not as sensitive as computed

(MRl). Radiography can detect adrenal masses that

they are mineralized (Penninck et al. 1988).

slightly dorsal to the vena cava. Half of adrenocortical
masses will calcify, but this will not distinguish between
benign and malignant tumors. Pheochromocytomas are
rarely mineralized. Any animal with a suspect adrenal
mass should have thoracic radiography performed to
evaluate for pulmonary metastasis.
As mentioned above, spontaneous peri-adrenal
 hemorrhage can occur. Acute peri-adrenal bleeding may
show loss of detail and increased soft-tissue density in
the retroperitoneal space on plain film radiography.
This abnormality is readily detected with more advanced
diagnostic imaging.

Thymic pathology is most often noted incidentally in
dogs and cats during routine geriatric thoracic radio-
graphic screening. When this is the case, clinical signs

Uitrasound
Ultrasonography is useful in the diagnosis of cranial
mediastinal masses. Additionally, ultrasound is an
excellent aid in fine-needle aspiration and biopsy collec-
tion (Gores et al. 1994). Thymomas can have variable
ultrasonographic appearances. In one study, two dogs
and one cat had thymomas that appeared solid with
ultrasound evaluation, whereas two dogs and one cat
had thymomas that were composed of fluid-filled cavities
(Zitz et al. 2008). Pleural effusion is also often noted on
ultrasonographic examination in dogs with thymomas
(Zitz et al. 2008).
Computed tomography
Computed tomography (CT) is superior to both radiog-
raphy and ultrasound in characterizing the extent of
thymic disease (Yoon et al. 2004; Hylands 2006). One
recent study reported on the use of CT in the evaluation
of cranial mediastinal masses in dogs and cats (Yoon
et al. 2004). This study evaluated nine patients with
thymomas, and seven of nine demonstrated a maximum
tumor width to thoracic width of 70% or more (Yoon
et al. 2004). The authors further categorized the

Procedures
Thymectomy (open approach)
When visualization of the thoracic cavity is achieved, a
complete exploration of the thoracic cavity is recom-
mended. For lateral thoracotomy and thoracoscopic
approaches, exploration of only the side that has been
entered is possible unless the mediastinum is opened.
Upon completion of the exploration, the surgeon should
gently palpate the extent of the thymic pathology. Due to
the location of the thymus within the cranial medias-
tinum, adherence of tumor to the surrounding vascu-
lature and pericardium is frequently noted. Vascular
invasion can be evaluated preoperatively using ultra-
 sound and CT, although the extent is not always appreci-

at the time of surgery.

(Lee et al. 2006). Most ultrasonographic studies have
focused on evaluating for fluid in the middle ear and
have been useful in this regard when no bony changes
are present (Dickie et al. 2003a,b).
Computed tomography
CT has greatly enhanced the evaluation of all portions
of the ear, especially the middle ear. Currently, many
veterinarians rarely take radiographs to assess the ear or
to evaluate other structures of the skull, instead opting
for CT examination. The absence of superimposition of
adjacent structures and the superior tissue contrast over
conventional X-ray examination greatly aid the evalua-
tion of the structures of the ear. While expensive, this
equipment is now available at many university hospitals
and private referral practices. For proper positioning of
the head, patients do require sedation or general anes-
thesia. We place the patient in sternal recumbency with

evaluating just the tympanic bullae, thin slices (1 mm
thick) are made through the tympanic bulla with a bone
algorithm to enhance osseous detail. One advantage of
CT is the ability to manipulate the images to emphasize
the bony structures or the soft-tissue structures by
selecting the range of CT numbers over which the gray
scale (or shades of gray) can be assigned. To view the
fine bony detail of the bullae, a bone window (a wide
range of CT numbers with a high center CT number) is
chosen to view these images. For our images, a bone
window utilizing a window width (Ww, i.e., the CT
number range) of 2000-2500 and a window level (WL,
i.e., the center CT number) of 400-500 is chosen.
        
visualized on these images, the primary purpose is to
evaluate the tympanic bulla and petrous temporal bone.
If a soft-tissue mass associated with the ears needs to be
evaluated, thicker slices (3-5mm) are made with a
soft-tissue algorithm through the entire area, and then
the study is repeated after intravenous administration

The anatomy of the canine middle and inner ear on
CT images has been described (Russo et al. 2002). The
thickness of the air-filled cavity of the bullae can be
clearly seen on transverse images along with the air-filled
external ear canals (Figure 9-3). Otitis media is indicated 
by increased soft-tissue opacity in the bulla (caused by
fluid accumulation or proliferative soft tissue within the

Narrowing of the ear canals and mineralization of the
external ear canal cartilages due to otitis externa may
also be seen (Figures 9-4 and 9-5). The changes may be
unilateral or bilateral and the severity of the changes
caused by otitis externa will vary.

commonly thought of as occurring in cats, inflammatory
 polyps may also be found in dogs (Pratschke 2003).
Chronic infection and neoplasia have to be considered
when there is unilateral lysis of the bulla (Figures 9-7 and
9-8). Most neoplasias do not arise directly from the
middle ear but affect the middle ear by extension from
surrounding structures (Forrest 2007). The lytic changes
and adjacent soft-tissue mass are often more extensive
than that seen with chronic infection (Forrest 2007)
(Figure 9-8). Cholesteatomas (epidermoid cysts contain-

Magnetic resonance imaging
MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast to both con-
ventional radiographic examination and CT. However,
the bone detail of the thin tympanic bulla may not be as
well visualized as that seen with CT examination.
If the area of interest is the inner ear and/or the
clinical suspicion is high for intracranial disease or
extension of otitis media or interna, then MRI may be
the choice for imaging evaluation (Sturges et al. 2006).
The external ear canal, associated surrounding tissues
and middle ear can also be evaluated (Figure 9-10).
The inner ear contains fluid in the membranous
labyrinth of the cochlea and semicircular canals and is
seen as high signal intensity on T2-weighted images
(Figure 9-10). The inner ear may be best visualized by

Surgery of the Pinna
Jamie R. Bellah
The pinna of dogs and cats is exposed and as a result is
to the pinna may be self-inflicted by head shaking and
ear scratching secondary to otitis externa, neoplasia, or
inflammation. The extensive blood supply results in
considerable hemorrhage when the pinna is lacerated or
injured and such a circumstance can be quite distressing
to owners because of the apparent volume of blood loss
 and the mess that results from persistent head shaking
and splattering of blood. Since the pinna of dogs and cats
is an important part of the appearance of pets, a cosmetic
 result after surgery is always a goal.
Lacerations
Managing lacerations of the pinna in dogs and cats
depends on the nature and extent of the injury. Sharp
laceration or crushing injury, partial or fuli thickness,
and the presence of an architectural defect are examples
(Figure 10-1). Lacerations that result from dog or cat
fights may have ragged edges and require debridement.
Simple linear lacerations limited to the skin of the
pinna usually require only hemostasis and measures to
prevent self-trauma by the pet. The skin, particularly on

 portion of the cartilage is necessary.
If the laceration extends through both sides of the
 pinna (full thickness), both skin surfaces and the cart-
ilage will need to be apposed. Lacerations may vary in
direction from vertical to horizontal and often extend to
the helical border of the pinna. The blood supply to the
distal aspects of the pinna may be affected by some lac-
erations, particularly those that are horizontal, and
tissue loss may complicate management. In addition,

Wedge excision and partial amputation
Fissures or small masses that extend to the helical border
 or which are small and close to the edge of the pinna may
be managed by wedge excision. A long triangular pattern
allows the edges to be apposed (sometimes incompletely)
 in a cosmetic manner (Figure 10-4). It is important to pay
attention to the vascular supply to the pinna so that loss of
viability after resection is avoided. When partial amputa-

such that the donor site chosen will have hair growth in
the same direction as the convex side of the pinna. In
addition, the skin used for reconstruction will usually be
thicker than that normally characteristic of the pinna
(Pavletic 2010). The distant pedicle flap is left in place for 
14 days so wound healing is complete and the new
collateral blood supply to the pedicle will be maintained
after the pedicle is released. The flap is sutured to the
remaining margins of the pinna. If two sides of the
cartilage are exposed, it may require a two-stage
technique to cover both concave and convex surfaces.

Drainage of the aural hematoma and maintenance of
apposition of the margins of the hematoma until
healing occurs contributes to a successful outcome
(Lanz & Wood 2004). Early drainage of the fluid from
 the aural cavity is important as secondary fibrosis and
contraction can result in permanent deformation of
the pinna.
There are a number of treatment options that have
been used successfully in dogs and cats (Brown 2010).

Daily aspiration has been recommended (Lanz & Wood

to lessen inflammation and subsequently decrease head
shaking and scratching at the ear.
Various methods of long-term continuous drainage
have been published previously and include teat cannula
insertion and multiple variations of drain insertion
(Lanz & Wood 2004). Chronic hematomas that have
scarring or a lot of fibrin are not amenable to drainage
techniques. All techniques are done by clipping and

Neoplastic and nonneoplastic disease forming mass

invasion into the structures of the ear canal infrequently

neoplasia is quite low, particularly in comparison with
the incidence of otic disease in general. However,
neoplastic conditions commonly cause a concomitant

malignant behavior is more commonly observed in cats.
Origins, occurrence, and clinical signs
Neoplasia arises from histologic components that
 comprise the surface and structural elements of all
regions of the ear. Within the ear, neoplasia originates
more commonly from tissue in the pinna and external
ear canal than components of the middle and inner ear
(Fan & de Lorimier 2004). Neoplasia such as parotid

clearly visible (Figure 14-4). The rostral auricular vein,
located just ventral to the tragus, is cauterized or ligated
before transection. The parotid gland must be reflected
ventrally to allow full exposure of the lateral wall; gentle
technique is necessary to avoid damaging it. The facial
nerve is located deep (medial) to the surgical site, but
one should exercise caution nonetheless, as aberrant
 anatomy or an overzealous dissection can lead to damage
of this nerve.
The next part of the procedure is best accomplished
with the surgeon positioned on the dorsal side of the
patient. Looking into the lumen of the vertical canal,
incisions are made along its rostral and caudal borders.

the caudal and rostral incisions (Figure 14-5). It is
important not to allow the two incisions to converge
because the drain board will become too narrow. The
incisions are continued ventrally to the junction of the
vertical (auricular cartilage) and horizontal (annular
cartilage) canals.
The lateral wall of the vertical canal can now be
reflected ventrally to create the drain board (Figure 14-6).
There should be minimal tension on the reflected lateral
wall; if it does not lie flat, it may be because the incisions
have not been extended to the level of the ligament
between the horizontal and vertical canals. Otherwise,
scoring the underside (ventral aspect) of the drain board
may be helpful. A drain board of 1-2 cm in length is cre-
ated by discarding the proximal portion of the lateral wall

end of the drain board to the ventralmost skin incision
and (2) the horizontal canal, cranially and caudally
(Figures 14-7 and 14-8). Sutures are then placed along the
drain board and, finally, the two incisions dorsal to the
level of the horizontal canal are closed. A 3-0 or 4-0 mono-
filament nonabsorbable suture is used to close the surgical
site (Figure 14-9). Cartilage exposure and infection can
increase the rate of dehiscence after surgery. Sedation of

Surgical Diseases of the Middle Ear
Elizabeth M. Hardie
The middle ear is a complex bony structure. Delicate
nerves traverse the main cavity and the openings to
the external ear canal and the inner ear are covered
only by fibrous membranes. Ventral bulla osteotomy
allows the surgeon to protect these structures as much
as possible, while providing exposure to remove
masses and fluid accumulations within the middle ear
cavity. Indications for ventral bulla osteotomy include
chronic otitis media (discussed in Chapter 13), polyps,

completely removing polyp tissue that has expanded

from 11% for nasopharyngeal polyps to 50% for ear
 polyps (Anderson et al. 2000; Muilenburg & Fry 2002;
Veir et al. 2002). Treatment of feline polyps with both
traction and ventral bulla osteotomy is associated with
recurrence rates of 0-4% (Faulkner & Budsberg 1990;

are extremely small, and in the pug, they are missing
completely (Oechtering & Noller 2008). As a consequence
of the hypogenesis of the upper jaw, aberrant growth
of the conchae is suspected. At birth, in the healthy
animal, the nasal cavity and turbinates are small and will
attain their final size later in life. Puppies have a typical
snub nose and adult animals have a more elongated one.
In the adolescent animal, the middle portion of the face
elongates and the turbinates grow until the lumen of
the nasal cavity is occupied (Negus 1958). Interestingly,
this growth stops before the mucosae of adjacent turbi-
nate lamellae touch each other. Despite the extraordi-
narily complex structure, small air gaps surround each
lamella, a precondition for effective ventilation of the
whole turbinate (Oechtering 2010).

Laryngeal diseases
Laryngeal  diseases  associated  with  brachycephalic
syndrome include mucosal edema, everted laryngeal
saccules, and laryngeal collapse. They are thought to be
secondary to the turbulent airflow and chronic high
 negative pressures in the pharynx (Figure 19-5) (Koch
et al. 2003; Monnet 2003; Pink et al. 2006; Torrez &
Hunt 2006; Riecks et al. 2007).
 In one early classification, everted laryngeal saccules
were considered the first degree of laryngeal collapse
(Leonard 1960). In this classification, stage 2 was
characterized by medial displacement of the cuneiform
processes of the arytenoid cartilages, and stage 3 by

Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome   173
Clinical signs
 Owners usually report heat, stress, and exercise intolerance.
Clinical signs include snoring, inspiratory dyspnea,
cyanosis and, in the most severe cases, syncopal episodes.
Apneas can be observed during sleep (Farquharson &
2
Smith 1942). Normally, during inspiration, the wings of
the nostrils are actively dilated (Evans 1993). If signs of
dyspnea occur, dogs stretch their necks upward to dilate
the nasopharynx and, if necessary, to move the elongated
soft palate below the epiglottis. When the elongated soff
palate is held above the epiglottis, some dogs lie down on
their sides, which releases the soft palate by alowing it to
glide laterally to the epiglottis (Singleton 1962; Knecht
3
1979). In addition, many owners describe signs of
regurgitation, vomiting, and dysphagia when their brachy-
cephalic dog becomes excited or is in respiratory distress.

Laryngeal diseases
Everted laryngeal ventricles (often named saccules, or
laryngoceles) are formed by eversion of the mucosa of
the laryngeal ventricles. The everted saccules may
obstruct the ventral half of the rima glottidis. In the past,
their excision has been recommended as a routine
procedure when they are found (Harvey & Venker-von
Haagan 1975; Harvey 1983a,d; Aron & Crowe 1985;
Hendricks 1992; Hobson 1995; Lorinson et al. 1997;

 It is performed via an oral approach using electrocautery,

reason for using a thyroarytenoid suture was to achieve
lateral displacement of the arytenoid and not just caudal
displacement with the cricoarytenoid suture. Schofield
et al. (2007) described the placement of a mattress suture
through the muscular process and the cuneiform process
of the arytenoid cartilage. The suture was placed in the
thyroid cartilage. A mineralized arytenoid cartilage may
crumble if a suture needle is forced through it; therefore,
holes can be predrilled in the cartilage with a sharp
18-gauge hypodermic needle before the suture is passed.
Even with predrilling, the cartilage may break during the
operation or later. An assistant can observe through the

A complication of devocalization per os is the
development of scar tissue that can obstruct the rima

A horizontal tracheotomy is performed between the
third and fourth, or fourth and fifth rings with no more
than half of the circumference of the trachea incised.
A monofilament nonabsorbable suture is placed around
the ring distal to the tracheostomy site. This suture is
used to open the tracheal incision to facilitate tube
placement, particularly if the tube has been removed
accidentally. A variety of tubes are available for use in
tracheostomies: single or double lumen, cuffed or
noncuffed (Figure 23-3). In an emergency situation, a
standard endotracheal tube can be used, but care must
be taken to ensure the tube is not inserted too far into
the respiratory tree, and that the cuff is not inflated.
Single-lumen tracheostomy tubes are easier to place,
 particularly in smaller animals; however, the entire tube
must be removed when cleaning is required, and this
may cause distress to the animal. Double-lumen tubes
 have an inner cannula that is amenable to easier cleaning
and maintenance, as the outer cannula stays in place,

Cystic and bullous lesions in the lungs are characterized
by a thin-walled cavity within the lung parenchyma
(Anderson 1987; Nelson & Sellon 2005; Lopez 2007).
Cysts can be filled with fluid or air and are covered by
respiratory epithelium (Aron & Kornegay 1983; Nelson
& Sellon 20o5). Pulmonary cysts are most commonly
associated with trauma (Aron & Kornegay 1983). Blunt
trauma to the chest with pulmonary contusion seems to
 be the most common cause of pulmonary cysts in dogs
and cats (Aron & Kornegay 1983). Younger animals seem
to be more at risk for the development of a cyst after
trauma. If an infection is present the cyst will become a
 pneumatocele or an abscess with destruction of the

Spontaneous idiopathic pneumothorax warrants close
examination of radiographs detailing the lung profile
and parenchyma for bleb, bullae, or cyst formation
(Puerto et al. 2002; Lipscomb et al. 2003). Computed
tomography (CT) has been recommended for the
diagnosis of bullae in dogs with spontaneous pneumo-
thorax (Puerto et al. 2002; Au et al. 2006). Atelectasis of
 the lobe containing the ruptured cavity occurs and may
obscure identification of underlying cysts.

Many cases respond to this therapy but the recurrence
rate is high (Puerto et al. 2002). Lung lobectomy is the
 treatment of choice for spontaneous pneumothorax in
dogs. Thoracoscopy has been used to evaluate visceral
surfaces for additional cysts and locate the ruptured
cavity (Brissot et al. 2003). It can be difficult to accom-
plish thorough evaluation of the entire surface of the
lungs with the endoscope. Mechanical pleurodesis can
be attempted at the time of surgery to induce complete
pleural adhesion and reduce the risk of recurrence.
Successful production of a complete adhesion for control
of the disease is uncommon in dogs (Jerram et al. 1999)
 It should not be the primary treatment for spontaneous
 pneumothorax in dogs.
Bronchoesophageal fistulas
Congenital tracheoesophageal and bronchoesophageal
fistulas are extremely rare in dogs and cats ( Basher et al.
1991; Johnson 2005). Bronchoesophageal fistulas can
result from foreign bodies that become wedged into the
esophagus. Pressure necrosis can induce the formation
of a fistula between the esophagus and the lung
parenchyma or an airway. Saliva and food can then
access the airway of a lung lobe and induce pneumonia.
 Dogs with a bronchoesophageal fistula are often pre-
sented for weight loss, elevated temperature, and cough-
ing associated with eating. Thoracic radiography with
water-soluble iodine is the best diagnostic tool
(Figure 24-2). Flexible endoscopy of the esophagus is

consolidated lung lobe induces a low V/Q mismatch and
significant desaturation of the arterial blood, which will
interfere with the activity level of the patient.
Barbed seeds or hulls (grass awns) and other small
 bodies inhaled into the bronchi resist dislodgment by
coughing and work their way along the small air passages
(Arnoczky & O'Neill 1979). A plant awn frequently
breaks into parenchymal tissue and causes a septic focus
that develops into an abscess. Awns may migrate some
 distance,laving lung abscesses, pyothorax, and draining
tracts in their wake. Small rocks, nuts, or other dense
objects that gain entrance into the bronchial tree may
obstruct or act like a one-way valve at a small bronchus.
The foreign body will be encapsulated in dense fibrous
tissue surrounding an abscess. It can also create a fistulous
tract. The part of the involved lobe with the foreign body
usually becomes atelectatic and secondarily septic.
History
This condition is manifested as a chronic debilitating
disease with various degrees of respiratory distress and

Diagnosis
 In a study by Murphy et al. (1997b), the mean age of pre-
sentation of 59 dogs treated with lung lobectomy for
 pneumonia was 5.0 ± 2.8 years. Anemia of a chronic dis-
order may be present. Lung abscess involves part of a
lobe and it may be thick or thin walled, or may rupture
 into the airway or pleural space but rarely erodes a blood
vessel. Ventilatory sounds range from moist rales and
friction rub to no sounds over the mass. Muffled sounds
are due to pleural effusion. If pleural effusion is present a
chest drain to relieve the respiratory distress may be
necessary. Severe leukocytosis with a degenerative left
shift is present on blood work.
If a foreign body has been inhaled, vague and inter-

Surgical approach
A median sternotomy should be used to approach the
 thoracic cavity because it will allow complete exploration
of the thoracic cavity and of all lung lobes. Total lobec-
tomy of the involved lung lobe is the treatment of choice
(see later section on lobectomy). Most torsioned lung
lobes are congested, friable, and necrotic. They should
not be untwisted because it would release inflammatory
cytokines and endotoxins.
The lung lobe should remain in the twisted position.
Stapling equipment should be used for the lobectomy
because it can be performed with the lung in an abnormal
position. If stapling equipment is not available, the ped-
icle of the lobe is clamped with noncrushing forceps
before the lobe is untwisted (Lord et al. 1973; Teunissen
et al. 1976). After untwisting the lung lobe a lung lobec.
 tomy can be performed with sutures. Effusion associated
with the torsion, even if it is chylous, will resolve within
7days of surgery (Johnston et al. 1984; Kerpsack et al.
1994; Neath et al. 2000; Murphy & Brisson 2006).

A solitary mass in a caudal lung lobe is the most

Cavitation of the mass can be seen if the mass has a

Stapling equipment is too large to use in the thorax of

Partial lung lobectomy can also be performed with
 thoracoscopy using staples or thoracoscopically assisted.
Specially designed staples (Endo GIA, United States 
Surgical Corporation, Norwalk, CT, USA) are used to
 perform partial lung lobectomy. Endo GLA staples come
 in three different dimensions: 30, 45 and 60 mm length
for the cartridge. Staplelengths are 2.0, 2.5,3.5, or 4.8 mm

 Thoracoscopy with an intercostal
approach is preferred (Lansdowne et al. 2005); 12-mm
cannulas are required to introduce the Endo GIA into
the thoracic cavity. Similar to open-chest surgery, the
staples have to be placed across the lobe proximal to the
lesions. Staple lengths of 2.5 mm are used for partial lung
lobectomy If a thoracoscopic-assisted approach is used,
 one cannula is placed in an intercostal space to visualize
where the lesion to resect is located, and another cannula
will then be placed in the intercostal space at the level of
the lesion to resect. The tip of the lung lobe will be
grasped with an atraumatic grasping forceps through
the cannula. The lung lobe will then be partially exterior-
ized after enlarging the cannula site. The partial lung
 lobectomy can be performed as during an intercostal
thoracotomy. The lung lobe will then be returned to the

Pneumonectomy
Acute restriction of more than 60% of the pulmonary
artery outflow is fatal in dogs because it can induce acute
 pulmonary hypertension (Tronc et al. 1999). This obser-
vation correlates well with dogs surviving a 50% total
lung loss but dying with a 75% loss (Brugarolas & Takita
1973). Excision of an entire left lung is tolerated if the
right lung is healthy because it only represents 42% of the
lung mass. Because the right lung is larger than the left, a

Pathophysiology
The peritoneum is a serous membrane consisting of
flattened mesothelial cells and loose connective tissue
with vascular and lymphatic capillaries, nerves, lympho-
cytes and macrophages. The peritoneal lining covers the
abdominal wall and diaphragm (parietal layer) and the
abdominal organs (visceral layer). A small amount of
fluid (<1 mL/kg) is normally present in the peritoneal
cavity (Swann & Hughes 2000).
Peritoneal injury results in vasodilation, increased
vascular permeability, and formation of a protein-rich
exudate. Lymphatics of the parietal
peritoneum,
diaphragm, and omentum work to clear the noxious
 stimulus and associated peritoneal fluid. Fibrin formation
 acts to wall off infectious substances but can result in
inhibition of lymphatic drainage.
Hypovolemia results from massive fluid loss into the

creatitis, this decreased detail may be seen as a ground-
glass appearance localized to the right cranial abdomen.
Widening of the angle between the pyloric antrum and
 duodenum may also be seen with pancreatitis.
Pneumoperitoneum may be present as a result of
 penetrating trauma or rupture of an abdominal viscus
and can often be visualized caudal to the diaphragm
outlining the crura (Figure 25-4). Presence of free air in
the abdomen without penetrating trauma usually results
from the rupture of the stomach, duodenum, or colon.
 Free air in the abdomen may also be seen normally for
weeks after abdominal surgery, complicating the diag-
nosis of a leaking intestinal anastomosis. Air seen within
the parenchyma of an organ is an indication of necrosis
 or infection with gas-producing bacteria.
Organomegaly may indicate the presence of an
abdominal mass or abscess and extremely dilated bowel
 may be seen with an obstructing foreign body or volvulus
(Figure 25-5). Organ malpositioning can also be seen
with volvulus, torsion, or neoplasia of abdominal organs.

Congenital Abdominal Wall Hernia
Amelia M. Simpson
Abdominal wall hernias are abnormal openings in the
 muscle wall of the abdominal cavity that allow the protru-
sion or projection of intra-abdominal fat or organs into
the subcutaneous or intramuscular space. In general,
there are three parts to a hernia: the ring, the sac, and the
Umbilica
contents. In abdominal wall hernias the ring is the actual
defect in the abdominal wall, the hernia contents are the
organs and structures that are permitted to pass through
the ring into the abnormal location, and the sac surrounds
-Inguinal
the hernia contents. True abdominal hernias, most often
congenital, have a peritoneal sac surrounding the hernia
contents. False hernias do not have a peritoneal sac. In
Femora
 traumatic or acquired abdominal wall hernias the con-
tents usually do not have a peritoneal sac initially,
although peritonealization may occur later if the hernia is
left untreated (Read & Bellenger 2003; Shaw et al. 2003).
Abdominal wall hernias can be reducible or irreduc-
ible/incarcerated. In general, reducible abdominal wall
hernias appear as small, soft, nonpainful swellings with
hernia contents that can be gently manipulated back into
the abdominal cavity. If the hernia is firm and the tissues
within it are not freely moveable, the hernia is classified
as incarcerated or irreducible.
 Congenital abdominal wall hernias include umbilical
and ventral midline hernias as well as inguinal, femoral,
and scrotal hernias (Figure 29-1). Inguinal hernias,
femoral hernias, and rarely umbilical hernias can be

cats with these malformations is not known, but it is
 suspected to be very high.
Clinical signs
The most common clinical sign of an umbilical hernia is
a soft swelling/mass-effect at the umbilical scar. Generally
seen in young animals, these hernias are often nonpain-
ful and easily reducible. Patients with umbilical hernias
should be thoroughly evaluated for other congenital
abnormalities.
Diagnostics
 Although an umbilical hernia is the most likely diagnosis
for a soft swelling at the umbilical scar, other differentials
include neoplasia, hematomas, seromas, and abscesses.

lungs (Worth & Machon 2005). Rib fractures and pain also
 compromise thoracic expansion and ventilation, and
therefore analgesia is important for the emergency
treatment of those cases (Boudrieau & Muir 1987).
Herniated organs interfere with venous return, which will
induce a reduction in cardiac output. Cardiac dysrhyth-
mias may occur due to the effects of hypovolemia and trau-
matic myocarditis. Hypoxemia and reduction of cardiac
output result in severe reduction of oxygen delivery.
 Incarceration of herniated abdominal viscera may
occur, which can lead to gastrointestinal obstruction or
necrosis of the affected organ and further exacerbate
systemic signs of illness. Gastric dilatation and volvulus
with associated diaphragmatic hernia has been reported
in three cats (Formaggini et al. 2008).
Other organs and tissues can be injured during
formation ofa traumatic hernia, including kidney damage,
rupture of ureters, laceration of the spleen, fracture of
extremities, and pelvic fractures (Gibson et al. 2005).

Thoracic and abdominal radiography is recommended
for confirming the diagnosis of a diaphragmatic hernia.
Abdominal radiographs may display an absence or

Treatment
 Preoperative management and timing of
surgery
A patient with an acute traumatic diaphragmatic hernia
 presents a high anesthetic risk and often needs to be
 treated for hypovolemic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and
hypoxemia.  Patients with a chronic diaphragmatic
hernia are usually more stable. However, chronic dia-
phragmatic hernias can cause acute decompensation

made to reinflate chronically collapsed lungs during

Although herniated viscera do not enter the pleural
cavity, they may still cause signs of respiratory insuffi-
ciency due to indirect compression. Similar to traumatic
diaphragmatic hernia, there may be strangulation or

muscle and originates on the medial edge of the shaft of
the ilium and the dorsal surface of the pubis and pelvic
symphysis. The levator ani, divided into iliocaudalis and
pubocaudalis portions, inserts on caudal vertebrae 3-7.
The coccygeus muscle arises from the ischiatic spine and
inserts on the transverse processes of caudal vertebrae
2-4 (Evans 1993). The ischiorectal fossa is the deep
wedge-shaped depression located lateral to the terminal
portions of the digestive and urogenital tracts. The
boundaries of the ischiorectal fossa are formed by
the levator ani and coccygeus muscles medially, the
superficial gluteal muscle dorsolaterally, and the internal
obturator muscle ventrally. Variable amounts of fat are
present in the fossa.
Additional structures that are important to the
understanding of perineal hernia anatomy include the
pudendal nerve and internal pudendal artery and vein
and the sciatic nerve. The pudendal nerve and the
internal pudendal artery and vein lie lateral to the
coccygeus muscle and cross its dorsolateral aspect into
the ischiorectal fossa in a ventral and medial direction.
The pudendal nerve branches into the caudal rectal

iliac vessels and branch into three vessels each: the caudal
rectal artery and vein, the ventral perineal artery and
vein, and the artery and vein of the penis or clitoris. The
sciatic nerve is located dorsolateral to the sacrotuberous
ligament exiting the pelvis towards the thigh ( Dorn 1982;
Evans 1993).
Transposition of internal obturator
The repair of perineal hernia in the dog by transposition
of the internal obturator muscle is described below based
on the initial report by Van Sluijs and Sjollema (1989)
(Figures 32-2, 32-3, 32-4, and 32-5). A vertical curvilinear
incision is made starting just distal and lateral to the base
of the tail and ending 2-3 cm distal to the ischial table.
The hernia sac will then become evident filling the
ischiorectal fossa. The sac is usually filled with fluid and
multiple 1-2cm fatty nodules, which are sometimes
necrotic. Once the hernia sac is open and fluid has
been removed, the herniated contents can be inspected
for abnormalities, pushed cranially, and packed with
gauze or a laparotomy sponge. The following anatomic
structures have to be identified before beginning the
hernia repair: the external anal sphincter, levator ani,
 coccygeus, and internal obturator muscles; the pudendal
artery, vein, and nerve; and the caudal rectal nerve. Often,

The gauze or laparotomy sponge is then removed, the
wound is thoroughly lavaged with warm saline or lactated
Ringer solution, and the sutures are tied. The subcutaneous
tissues are closed in a routine manner. Intradermal
sutures without skin sutures may be used to prevent
 postoperative contamination of the incision due to fecal
accumulation on the suture tags. The pursestring suture
is removed and rectal palpation is performed to ensure
that reconstruction of the muscular support has been
achieved and that sutures were not placed through the
rectal wall. Prescrotal castration can be performed imme-
diately before or after the herniorrhaphy. A caudolateral
approach to the scrotum allows the orchiectomy to be

Various studies have reported the results following

 A recurrence rate of approximately 5% and 2% was found
in two different studies (Hardie et al. 1983; Sjollema &

Specific disorders
Salivary mucocele (sialocele)
Salivary mucocele formation is the most common dis-
 ease of the salivary gland in the dog and cat. The muco-
cele is formed from secretion of saliva from a defect in
the gland or duct system. The most commonly affected
glands are the mandibular and sublingual, with the sub-
lingual gland being the most frequent source of saliva.
The lining of the mucocele consists of inflammatory
tissue surrounded by granulation tissue. There is no evi-
dence of a secretory lining present in the mucocele and
therefore it cannot be considered a true cyst.
There are three major types of salivary mucocele
based on the location of the swelling: cervical muco-
cele, sublingual mucocele (ranula), and pharyngeal
mucocele. Zygomatic mucoceles may also occur, but
are very uncommon. Cervical mucoceles are generally
located on the lateral aspect of the head and neck from
the level of the mandibular and sublingual salivary
glands to the intermandibular space. The majority of
 patients present with mucoceles in the intermandibular
region. Sublingual mucoceles, or ranulas, are formed
from an accumulation of saliva along the base of the
tongue. A less common location for salivary mucoceles
 is the pharynx. Pharyngeal mucoceles appear as a fluc-

vary glandular tissue has an unusual appearance at the
time of resection, it should be submitted for histopatho-
logic evaluation. Closure of the incision includes apposi-
tion of muscle, subcutaneous tissues, and skin with
simple interrupted or simple continuous sutures.
Alternatively, a ventral approach could be considered
(Ritter et al. 2006). An incision is made from the level of
the linguofacial vein to the rostral intermandibular space.
The mandibular gland is located at the caudal aspect of
this incision. An intracapsular dissection is performed as
described above with dissection of the salivary chain ros-
trally to the level of the digastricus muscle. The digastri-
cus muscle is then undermined from a cranial direction
in order to follow the ducts as they course rostrally under
the mylohyoideus muscle. This muscle is incised to gain
access to residual sublingual salivary glandular tissue.
Complications associated with salivary gland resection
are few, but may include inadvertent lymph node removal,
operation of the incorrect side, incisional infection,
submandibular seroma, and recurrence due to incom-
plete removal. Prognosis following surgery is generally
 good to excellent, with very low recurrence rates. This is
in contrast to a 42% recurrence rate associated with
surgical drainage alone (Bellenger & Simpson 1992).
Ranula
A ranula is a thin-walled linear swelling that results from

Tissue must be handled with care and attention should
be paid to the numerous vital anatomic structures that
are closely associated with the esophagus. To reduce con-
fusion and to appropriately identify the adjacent ana-
tomic structures, a stomach tube or an esophageal
stethoscope should be passed (if possible) within the
lumen of the esophagus to aid in the determination of
esophageal location. The surgical region should be iso-
lated and packed off with moistened laparotomy sponges
to reduce spillage and to protect the surrounding struc-
tures from contamination. Stay sutures can also be placed
 in the esophagus to aid in the mobilization of the tissue.

Esophageal fistula
Esophageal fistulas are an abnormal communication
between the esophageal lumen and its surrounding
structures (Gualtieri 2001). Esophageal fistulas can be
either congenital or acquired. Congenital fistulas are rare
and result from incomplete separation of the tracheo-
bronchial tree from the digestive tract during embryo-

tracheal, or  esophagobronchial  communications are
uncommon despite the intimate anatomic relationship
between these structures (Parker & Caywood 1987).
Acquired fistulas are more common than congenital
fistulas, typically resulting from ingestion of a foreign
body with pointed edges such as bones, chronic ulcerative
lesions, esophageal perforation, extension of inflamma-
tion into adjacent tissue, or complications associated
with esophageal surgery caused by sutures (Sherding
Et al. 1999; Washabau 2005). Bronchoesophageal fistulas
are more common than tracheoesophageal fistulas in
dogs (Kyles 2002). The majority of reported cases of
esophagobronchial fistulas and all reported cases of
esophagoaortic and esophagotracheal fistulas developed
secondary to esophageal perforation by a bony foreign
object (Parker et al. 1989).
Clinical signs are typically associated with the
respiratory system. The most common clinical sign is
coughing and may be associated with liquid ingestion

responsible for the good outcome (Guiot et al. 2008).
Barrier pressure at the GEJ has been shown in the

gastropexy. The results of the increased barrier
pressure at the GEj likely explains why the risk of GER

speaks to the clinical relevance of using this procedure
alone (Pratschke et al. 2001). However, performing
this procedure on immature cats and dogs may be
questionable due to its possible effect on the growth of
the animal. In the immature animal, therefore, it is
prudent to perform an esophagopexy to prevent reher-
niation (Guiot et al. 2008). Tube gastrostomy or inci-

attempted with one of two main classes of drugs:
 H,-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors.
H,-receptor antagonists exert their activity by revers-
ibly binding the histamine receptor on the gastric parietal
cell. Of the most commonly used H,-receptor antago-
nists, famotidine, cimetidine and ranitidine, famotidine
 achieves the most effective acid suppression, reducing
maximal acid output by 50-70% (Katz et al. 1987;
Bersenas et al. 2005). Famotidine also prevents NSAID-
induced decrease in mucosal blood flow by an unknown
mechanism (Hata et al. 2005). In this way, famotidine
 may serve in prevention of gastric ulcers, as well as for
 treatment. Famotidine, administered daily at 1 mg/kg,

Gastric decompression techniques
Percutaneous decompression
Percutaneous decompression of the stomach is one of the
easiest techniques to perform, particularly if there are a
limited number of personnel available to restrain the
dog. To perform percutaneous gastric decompression,
the abdomen should be auscultated and percussed to
find the area with a sharp pinging sound (Walshaw &
Johnston 1976; Brockman et al. 1995; Eggertsdottir &
Moe 1995; Mackenzie et al. 2010) (Figure 37-3). A dull

Diagnostic imaging
 If a radiograph is required for the diagnosis of GDV, a
right lateral abdominal radiograph is the view of choice
to make a diagnosis (Hathcock 1984). Most commonly,
there is gas distension of the body of the stomach, with
dorsocranial displacement  of  the gas-filled pyloric
antrum (Figure 37-7). If gastric distension is present on
 the radiographs, it can be due to GDV that derotated on

Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp-, Enterobacter spp,
Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas spp. (Evans et al. 1994).

Magnetic resonance imaging
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has several limita-
 tions regarding abdominal imaging, including excessive
 motion artifact due to long acquisition time, peristalsis
and respiration in addition to low signal-to-noise ratio
and lack of suitable oral contrast agents (Paley & Ros
1997). The usefulness of MRI for detecting gastrointes-
tinal disease in humans is still being investigated. HASTE

and on surgical exploration three of these cats were found
to have intestinal perforations. A review of 64 feline cases
of thread and needle linear foreign bodies found that 10
 of63 surgical cases had evidence of perforation secondary
to the thread (Felts et al. 1984). An overall success rate of
84% was reported but only 50% of the cases with perfora-
tions recovered. Because of the poor survival rate in cats
with perforation, conservative management of linear
foreign bodies cannot be recommended.
Linear foreign body obstruction in the dog reportedly
 occurs in approximately 16% of canine gastrointestinal
obstructions (Hayes 2009). A study evaluating gastroin-
testinal foreign bodies in the dog found the linear
foreign material to be anchored in the pylorus in 87%
of the cases and under the tongue in only 6% of

(Figures 38-5 and 38-6). The presence of a linear foreign
body has been associated with an increased mortality
rate compared with a discrete obstruction (Hayes 2009).
 Intussusception often requires enterectomy followed
by anastomosis due to compromised blood flow and
necrosis or inability to reduce secondary to adhesions.
 Manual reduction is typically attempted first but variable
success has been reported (Wilson & Burt 1974; Levitt &
Bauer 1992; Burkitt et al. 2009). Spontaneous reduction
 of intestinal intussusception has been reported in dogs
(Patsikas et al. 2008) where the diagnosis was made
surgical findings were normal. One dog developed
clinical signs again within 48 hours and a second surgical
exploration revealed an enteroenteric intussusception.
Reported recurrence rates for intussusception in dogs
range from 18.5 to 27% (Levitt & Bauer 1992; Oakes
et al. 1994). Because of the high risk of recurrence,
enteroplication following resolution of the intussuscep-
tion has been proposed to minimize the risk of recur-
rence. Due to small numbers of cases, statistical

Enterotomy
A focal obstruction with no evidence of perforation or
intestinal wall compromise is removed via a single enterot-
omy just aboral to the foreign body along the antimesen-
teric border. To perform the enterotomy, the affected area of

prevent the intestinal contents from leaking into the sur-
gical field (Figure 38-9). A linear incision is made into the
intestine of sufficient size to allow the foreign material to be
removed. Suction should be available to assist in the removal
of any intestinal contents that spill from the intestine.
Several closure techniques have been described in the
veterinary literature. The standard technique described is a
full-thickness simple interrupted or continuous closure
using 3-0 or 4-0 synthetic absorbable monofilament sutures
spaced 3-4mm apart (Figure 38-10) (Weisman et al. 1999).

Nutrition is an important component of the postop-
erative recovery in dogs and cats with gastrointestinal
obstruction. Enteral feeding should be instituted within
24 hours as long as the patient is not vomiting
(Papazoglou et al. 2003). The benefits of enteral feeding
in humans and animals include stimulation of mucosal
growth, maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosal integ-
rity, and decreased risk of bacterial translocation across
the intestinal wall (Tara & Jacobs 1998; Swann &
Hughes 2000).
 In critically ill patients, a gastrojejunostomy feeding
tube can be placed during surgery to provide enteral
nutrition in the postoperative period (Cavanaugh et al.
2008). The reported complication rate is high but most

complete, venous obstruction occurs first and results in
edema and vascular congestion of the intestinal wall,
disruption of peristalsis, and tissue anoxia. Fluid and gas
begin to accumulate within the lumen resulting in rapid
 intestinal distension. Sloughing of the mucosal epithe-
lium follows and blood begins accumulating in the
 intestinal lumen and may extravasate into the peritoneal
cavity. Within several hours, the intestine reaches
maximal distension and full-thickness disintegration of
the intestinal wall occurs. With complete arterial occlu-

affected, causing ischemic necrosis of the distal

Mesenteric Volvulus 375
Diagnosis
Mesenteric volvulus most commonly occurs in young
 male large-breed dogs. German shepherd dogs are overly
represented, but other sporting or working breeds have
been reported (e.g., English pointers). Dogs with mesen-
 teric volvulus typically present with peracute abdominal
pain, retching, vomiting, hematochezia, weakness and/
or recumbency. Chronic partial mesenteric volvulus
associated with intermitent vomiting and diarrhea has
been reported in one dog (Spevakow et al. 2010).
Physical  examination  reveals evidence of shock
(tachycardia, weak peripheral pulses, slow capillary refill
time, and pale or injected mucous membranes) and
sharp pain on abdominal palpation. Dogs may have
varying degrees of abdominal distension that is not

treatment of idiopathic megacolon (Figure 41-3).
Subtotal colectomy will remove 90-95% of the colon. It
is important to remove this amount of colon, regardless
 of how much colon appears involved grossly at the time
of surgery, as recurrent constipation can be observed if
insufficient length of colon is removed. Partial colec-
tomy, removing only the grossly affected colon, has
been described but is not recommended due to the high
rate of recurrent constipation and histologic evidence
that the entire colon is affected in cases of idiopathic
megacolon (Fellenbaum 1978). The level of proximal
resection will be determined by whether the ileocolic
valve is retained or not. If the ileocolic valve is removed,
an ileocolic anastomosis is done and there will be
luminal disparity between the ends of the anastomosis.
If the ileocolic valve is preserved, 2-3cm of the
ascending colon should be retained and a colocolic
 anastomosis performed. The descending colon is tran-
sected approximately 2-4cm cranial to the pubis to

strongly recommended in cases of canine acquired
hypertrophic megacolon (Nemeth et al. 2008). Tension
 at the anastomosis site is more likely with preservation
of the ileocolic valve due to the short mesocolon. If
tension at the anastomosis is likely, then removal of the
ileocolic valve and ileocolic anastomosis is indicated
for a tension-free anastomosis.
 Prior to making the intestinal incisions, the terminal
ileum and colon are exteriorized from the abdominal
cavity and packed off with laparotomy sponges. The
colonic luminal contents should be gently milked away
 from the proposed incision sites. Atraumatic intestinal
clamps (e.g., Doyen intestinal forceps) or surgical assis-
tant's fingers can be used to keep intestinal contents from
the incision site.
The vasa recta vessels supplying the colonic seg-
ments to be removed should be ligated according to the
level of resection. If the ileocecal valve is preserved, the
right colic, middle colic, and left colic vessels will be
ligated. If the ileocecal valve is removed, the ileocolic
and mesenteric and antimesenteric branches of the ileal
artery (terminal arcade of jejunal vessels) need to be
ligated in addition to the vessels described above. Care
must be taken to not damage the cranial or caudal
mesenteric arteries.

in either a simple interrupted or modified continuous
appositional suture pattern. If a continuous suture
pattern is used, a maximum of 180° of the anastomosis
should be done before tying the suture off to avoid a
pursestring effect. Each suture throw should be placed
approximately 5 mm from the anastomosis margin and
sutures should be spaced 3-5 mm apart (Figure 41-5).
Care should be taken to ensure that the submucosal layer
is incorporated in the sutures as this is the primary
holding layer of the colon. The easiest way to do this is to
use full-thickness suture bites incorporating all four his-
tologic layers.

& Pavletic 1993). The EEA stapler creates an inverting
anastomosis. A Furness clamp is very useful to create the
pursestring sutures required for positioning the anvil of
the EEA stapling device within the lumen (Figure 41-6).
In cats, the disposable 21-mm or 25-mm diameter EEA
stapling device is introduced through a transcecal access
site into the bowel, as the transanal retrograde approach
is very difficult in cats due to their narrow pelvic canal.
Also it can result in significant contamination of the sur-
gical site (Figures 41-7 and 41-8). Passage of the EEA
stapler through the cecal access site may require dilation
with a series of ovoid sizes. The cecal access site is closed
with a TA stapler. The main complication observed with
this technique was postoperative bleeding that required
 treatment with a blood transfusion in 2 of 15 cats. Long-
term outcome results in this study were excellent. A tran-

Closed anal sacculectomy
Some surgeons prefer filling or packing the anal sacs
prior to resection to improve delineation of the organ.
Products that have been described for this use include
string, yarn, plaster of Paris, agar base gel, dental molds,
hydrocolloid, and silicone sealant (MacPhail 2008). In
 general, these products are injected into the anal sac to
fll and outline the sac for dissection. When anal sac neo-
plasia is suspected or has been diagnosed preoperatively
no material should be injected into the anal sac duct.
Another technique that has been described to delin-
eate the anal sac includes the use of a Foley (balloon-
tipped) catheter (Downs & Stampley 1998). For this
procedure, a Foley catheter is placed within the anal sac,

Where to attenuate a shunt
Along their course, portosystemic shunts may have
several contributing venous tributaries before they
anastomose with the systemic circulation. Therefore,
although it is important to identify the shunt throughout
 its length, dissection should be directed at the point
where the shunt connects with the caudal vena cava or
 the azygos vein. If the shunt is attenuated too far from
its connection with the systemic circulation and a
tributary is still perfusing the shunt distal to the atten-
uation site, continuation of shunting is expected and
 the patient may not improve after surgery.
After identification of an intrahepatic shunt, it is more
logical to attenuate the hepatic vein draining the shunt
cranial to the liver rather than to attenuate the branch of
the portal vein feeding into the shunt (Breznock et al.

ameroid ring was never complete ( Monnet & Rosenberg
2005). Therefore another mechanism, such as inflamma-
tion and fibrosis, likely contributes to complete closure
of the shunt. Ameroid rings can induce complete occlu-
sion of shunts as soon as 7-10 days (Youmans & Hunt
1999; Besancon et al. 2004). This rapid occlusion is due
more likely to inflammation and vasculitis, which can
induce thrombus and premature closure of the shunt.
This rapid occlusion is thought to have contributed to
the development of acquired shunts in 17% of the cases
in two different studies using the ameroid constrictor
(Vogt et al. 1996; Mehl et al. 2005). Application of petro-

 Postoperatively, the patient may develop cardiac arrhyth-

with continuous ECG and a plan formulated to treat
arrhythmias if needed. Blood pressure should be
monitored for a day or two after surgery. Daily bloodwork

Clinicai signs
The age of dogs afflicted with liver abscesses typically
ranges from 4 to 16years, with a mean age of 10.6 years;
however, puppies have also been reported to develop this
condition (Hargis & Thomassen 1980; Schwarz et al.
1998). The mean age of cats with liver abscesses is
10.1years (Zatelli et al. 2005). No sex predilection
has been substantiated. Clinical signs common to liver
abscessation include lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, diar-
rhea, trembling, abdominal pain, fever, and dehydration.
Cats generally have a much lower incidence of fever
(23% vs. 86%) and abdominal pain (31% vs. 57%) than
dogs (Schwarz et al. 1998; Sergeeff et al. 2002).
Laboratory
Leukocytosis is found in 75-85% of patients (Farrar
Et al. 1996; Schwarz et al. 1998). Neutrophilia with left
shift, monocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
are common hematologic abnormalities (Schwarz
et al. 1998). Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase is
uniformly seen in canine patients, and elevated ala-
nine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
levels are common. In cats, alkaline phosphatase is
elevated in 18% of cases; however, alanine aminotrans-
ferase is elevated in 45% of cases (Sergeeff et al. 2002).
 Hyperbilirubinemia is seen in 36% of affected dogs
 and is not a negative prognostic indicator as it is in

Liver Tumors and Partial Hepatectomy
Daniel A. Degner and Richard Walshaw
Primary liver tumors comprise 0.6-2.6% of all tumors in
dogs (Strombeck 1978; Patnaik et al. 1980; Trigo et al.
1982) and 1.5-2.3% of all tumors in cats (Engle & Brodey
1969). They originate from the cells that constitute the
liver: hepatocytes, bile duct epithelial cells, neuroendo-
crine cells, and connective tissue cells. Hepatocytes can
transform into hepatocellular carcinomas, adenomas,
 and hyperplastic nodules. The epithelium that lines bile
ducts may become bile duct carcinomas or adenomas.
Neuroendocrine cells can transform into carcinoids or
carcinomas. Sarcomas develop from connective tissue
cells.
Primary liver tumors may also be characterized
by their gross morphologic characteristics (Patnaik
et al. 198la,b). Massive tumors are large tumors that

Laboratory findings
Complete blood count abnormalities include anemia

thrombocytosis in 46.2% of cases (Liptak et al. 2004). In
other studies, leukocytosis is uncommon (Patnaik et al.

associated with a multitude of malignancies in humans
and has been previously reported in 46.2% of dogs with
liver tumors (Liptak et al. 2004). Thrombocytosis may be
associated with anemia, inflammation, iron deficiency,
 and cytokine production. In Liptak's study, there was no

Ultrasound
Center 1996; Rivers et al. 1997).
Ultrasound is a sensitive and specific indicator of the cause
of EHBT obstruction (Nyland et al. 1989, 1999; Smith
1998). Gallstones are readily identified with abdominal
ultrasound. Abdominal ultrasound is currently the most
useful and practical technique for demonstrating gall-
bladder and bile duct dilation associated with obstruction
in small animals. Ultrasonographic findings of bile duct
distension secondary to obstruction may be identified in
up to 100% of cases involving dogs and cats (Figure 47-2)
(Washizu et al. 1994; Smith 1998; Besso et al. 2000). It is
important to note that biliary obstruction may be diag-
nosed before the onset of clinical icterus with the use of
abdominal ultrasonography and that minimal intrahe-
 patic duct distension is a subtle abnormality but is identi-
fied on ultrasound as early as 4 hours after experimental
biliary occlusion (Zeman et al. 1981; Washizu et al. 1994;
Smith 1998; Besso et al. 2000). The absence of gallbladder

the body. Without bile salts, fat absorption will con-
tinue to fail, as will the absorption of the fat-soluble
vitamins. Given the natural detergent and endotoxin-
binding properties of bile salts, portal blood flow will
continue to carry endotoxin and bacteria to the liver
with a compromised RES. It is likely that the lack of bile
salts in the small intestine has much to do with the
severe and critical systemic illnesses often observed in
 patients with EHBT obstruction (Pitt 1985, 1986; Pitt
et al. 1985; Sung et al. 1992; Mehler et al. 2004; Nagino
et al. 2007). It is important to remember that treatment
of biliary tract sepsis without biliary tract decompression
will be ineffective because no antibiotics will achieve
adequate levels in the biliary tree in the presence of
EHBT obstruction.
Choledochal stenting
Choledochal  stenting is frequently performed  in
humans to provide a conduit for bile flow into the

can be passed across the area of obstruction. Treatment
of traumatic bile duct injury with subsequent bile
leakage in addition to primary ductal repair can be
 supported by a choledochal stent, although it remains
unclear in small animals whether stents are beneficial
or detrimental to healing in these situations. Other
indications for choledochal stenting may include
palliation of malignancy and temporary drainage of
the biliary system prior to definitive surgical repair in 
severely compromised animals.
Prior to considering choledochal stent placement, the
EHBT should be thoroughly evaluated for any evidence
of biliary tract perforation, intraluminal or extraluminal
masses, or pancreatic abnormalities. An antimesenteric
 duodenotomy is performed over the anticipated location
of the major duodenal papilla. A red rubber catheter of
appropriate size (usually 3.5-5 Fr for cats and 8-12 Fr
for larger dogs) is used to catheterize the major duodenal
papilla to assess patency of the duct. Care should be
taken not to enter the pancreatic duct; this can occur

is advised due to the possibility for obstruction and
ascending cholangiohepatitis. Endoscopic placement of
choledochal stents using a side-view endoscope has
been evaluated in experimental dogs only but may
hold promise for minimally invasive placement of
choledochal stents in the future.
Cholecystostomy tubes
Cholecystostomy tubes provide temporary diversion of
bile from the gallbladder to an extracorporeal closed
collection system. Similarly to choledochal stenting, if
used to treat a temporary and reversible cause of EHBT
 obstruction such as pancreatitis, they will not result in
any long-term anatomic alteration to the EHBT, unlike
biliary rerouting procedures. In some cases judged to
be poor candidates for prolonged anesthesia, establish-
ing temporary biliary drainage may be of value. The

subsequent intraperitoneal bile leakage has also been

tomy is an acceptable technique, cholecystojejunoduo-
denostomy with a shorter jejunal limb should be
evaluated further in small animal patients.
Clinically useful gallbladder rerouting techniques are
limited to cholecystoduodenostomy and cholecystojeju-
nostomy. The mucosal appositional technique of chole-
cystoduodenostomy  is currently  the recommended
( a  so n  q  n
2003). The technique involves creating a permanent
stoma between the small bowel and the gallbladder. This
can be done with hand suturing or with automatic sta-
pling devices (Buote et al. 2006; Morrison et al. 2008).
The most critical factor in biliary-enteric anastamosis
(b)
refluxed intestinal contents from the biliary tract back
into the intestine. Numerous surgery texts recommend
that the length of the cholecystoenterostomy opening
 should be 2.5-4 cm to minimize postoperative problems
 such as cholangitis associated with inadequate draining
of refluxed intestinal contents (Blass & Seim 1985;
Matthiesen & Rosin 1986; Matthiesen 1989). It is recom-
mended that a large stoma is made because contraction
is expected to be about 50% of the original stoma size.
We recommend creating an incision in the gallbladder
that extends from the fundus to the beginning of the
cystic duct and a corresponding incision in the intestine
of equivalent length to minimize the effect of postopera-
tive stoma contraction.

Two main factors must be considered when deciding
which part of the small bowel to attach to the gallbladder.
Itis ideal to be as proximal in the small intestine as possible
without creating tension on the biliary-enteric anastamo-
sis. This will allow bile to enter the gastrointestinal tract as
close to its normal anatomic location as possible without 
leading to dehiscence of the anastamosis. Two techniques
that assist in decreasing the tension on a proximal anasta-
 mosis include release of the duodenocolic ligament and
careful dissection of the gallbladder from the hepatic fossa.
The surgeon must be careful not to damage, twist, or
stretch the cystic artery when removing the gallbladder
from the hepatic fossa or when the gallbladder is sutured to
the intestine as dehiscence will occur. In balancing the pros

Other Surgical Diseases of the Gallbladder
and Biliary Tract: Cholecystitis, Neoplasia
Infarct, and Trauma
Steve J. Mehler and Phiipp D. Mayhew
Trauma
Trauma to the biliary tract is one of the most common
causes of sterile bile peritonitis in veterinary patients
(Watkins et al. 1983; Ludwig et al. 1997). The most
common traumatic etiology is being hit by a car, but
gunshot wounds, bite wounds, and other penetrating
abdominal wounds are also potential causes. Blunt
trauma causes rupture of the common bile duct more
frequently than rupture of the gallbladder. The most
common site of common bile duct rupture is just distal
to the entrance of the last hepatic duct but the distal
common bile duct, cystic duct (Figure 48-1), and hepatic
ducts may also be injured (Martin et al. 1986; Parchman &
Flanders 1990; Neer 1992; Mehler et al. 2004). The pr0-
posed mechanism of bile duct rupture from trauma
involves rapid gallbladder emptying at the time of impact
and a simultaneous shearing force applied to a relatively
short duct system. Recognition of biliary tract trauma is
frequently delayed, sometimes for weeks, and clinical
signs result from the ensuing bile peritonitis. Bile perito-

cannot be debrided completely, the omentum can be
used to provide further drainage of the pancreatic
abscess.
Closed-suction drains can be placed at the end of the
surgery if the amount of contamination of the peritoneal
 cavity is not too severe. An open abdomen has been
used to provide adequate drainage of the abdominal
cavity, especially if the abscess has ruptured at the time
of surgery (see Chapter 25) (Salisbury et al. 1988;
Edwards et al. 1990; Stimson et al. 1998; Thompson
et al. 2009).

level of the bulbourethral glands, which can be difficult
around 2-3 cm long. The urethrostomy can be completed
with either simple interrupted sutures or two continuous
suture patterns (Newton & Smeak 1996). It is important
to achieve accurate mucosa to skin apposition without
tension on the stoma. Usually, 4-0 absorbable suture mate-
rial is used to perform the urethrostomy (Figure 52-4).
The most common complication is hemorrhage from the
surgical site for a few days after surgery; stricture formation
is uncommon (Newton & Smeak 1996). It is important to
prevent self-mutilation since it will increase the risk of
stricture formation. Sedation might be required to reduce
 the incidence of hemorrhage affer surgery.

to see in castrated male cats (Figure 52-7). A catheter is
placed in the urethra and the urethra incised distally.
The urethral incision is extended to the level of the
bulbourethral glands, which represent the distal end of
the wider intrapelvic urethra (Figure 52-8) (Phillips &
Holt 2006). A single simple interrupted suture is placed
between the tunic of the penis proximally and the subcu-
taneous tissue at the dorsal end of the incision to reduce
tension on the anastomosis. Four simple interrupted
sutures (4-0 to 5-0 nonabsorbable suture material) are
preplaced to form the proximal end of the stoma. These
sutures should be placed from the urethral mucosa to the
skin. These sutures are tightened to check the apposition
of mucosa and skin and then tied. The urethral mucosa
and skin are then sutured for a further 1-1.5 cm distally
(Figure 52-9). Simple interrupted or simple continuous
suture pattern can be used (Figure 52-10) (Agrodnia
et al. 2004). The penis is ligated distal to the stoma and
transected and the remaining skin incision closed.

of continence after surgery (Gregory 1984; Gregory et al.
1984; Griffin et al. 1989). However, it has been shown
that the degree of dissection around the urethra does not
seem to affect the urethral pressure profile in cats
(Sackman et al. 1991). Stricture formation is the most
common complication and is usually caused by failure
to extend the incision cranial to the bulbourethral gland
or by failing to prevent the cat self-traumatizing the site
(Phillips & Holt 2006). The urethrostomy can be success-
fully revised in most cats with strictures (Phillips &
Holt 2006). If revision is not possible, then transpubic or
subpubic urethrostomy is recommended (Ellison &
Lewis 1989; Bernarde & Viguier 2004). Subcutane0us
urine leakage is usually the result of poor mucosal-to-
skin apposition or trauma to the stoma. Perineal hernia
and urinary incontinence are rare and reflect excessive
intrapelvic dissection.

the urethra and the skin. It is important to achieve good apposi-
tion of the skin with the urethra.
 Prepubic or antepubic urethrostomy is performed in
both male and female cats and dogs with irreparable
obstruction of the intrapelvic urethra (McCully 1955;
Mendham 1970; Carb & Yoshioka 1982; Baines et al.
2001). In the male dog, a technique of creating the ure-
throstomy opening in the prepuce has been described
after penile amputation (Pavletic & O'Bell 2007).
A standard approach to the caudal abdomen is made.
The maximum length of normal urethra should be main-
tained: in the female, the urethra should be transected
close to the vagina, whereas in the male dog it should be
 transected distal to the prostate. It is important that
the location of the urethrostomy opening be chosen to
 create a gentle arc with the urethra and prevent kinking
at the bladder neck. The exact position depends on the
length of the remaining urethra and the conformation of
the animal. The urethra is exteriorized lateral to the
abdominal incision and two simple interrupted sutures
placed between the adventitia of the urethra and the
linea alba to reduce tension on the stoma. The exterior-
ized urethra is spatulated and a stoma created with
simple interrupted sutures. The abdominal incision is
closed routinely.
Prepubic urethrostomy is associated with significant
complications, but is a viable salvage procedure ( Mendham

kidney is warranted. Renal scintigraphy using the radio-
isotope technetium-99 m diethylenetriamine pentaacetic
acid (*Te-DTPA) is the method of choice for measuring
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in these cases (Kerl &
Cook 2005) and has been shown to be clinically useful
when deciding whether to perform ureteronephrectomy
(Gookin et al. 1996). This is the only method for single-
kidney GFR assessment and is a rapid noninvasive tech-
nique that does not require urine collection, unlike most
 other methods of GFR measurement. The disadvantages
of this technique are principally logistical in that it
requires specialized materials, and radiation safety

than leaving the ureteral tunnel in situ (Mayhew et al.

technique is avoidance of recanalization, which has
rarely been reported in dogs after simple distal ureteral
tunnel ligation (Holt & Hotston-Moore 1995). The inci-
dence of postoperative UTI could also be affected by
leaving a blind-ended distal ureteral tunnel within the
urethral wall although no difference was found in the
incidence of postoperative UT1 between the two tech-
niques (Mayhew et al. 2006). It seems, therefore, that in
dogs where pubic symphysiotomy would be necessary to
resect the very distal segment of the distal ureteral
tunnel, this procedure is unwarranted. Three dogs that
underwent the procedure remained at least somewhat
incontinent postoperatively (Mayhew et al. 2006). Most

In cats the most common renal tumor is lymphoma
(Crow 1985). Renal involvement is most often associated
with alimentary or multicentric forms of lymphoma
(Crow 1985). Of the primary renal tumors in cats, carci-
nomas are the most common (tubular and tubulopapil-
lary), followed by transitional cell carcinomas (Henry
et al. 1999). Nephroblastoma, hemangiosarcoma, and
adenoma have also been reported (Henry et al. 1999).

Three-view thoracic radiographs are taken to identify

and percutaneous antegrade pyelography may improve
results (Reichle et al. 2003). Abdominal ultrasound is often
useful in these cases and will generally show hydronephro-
sis of the affected kidney and some degree of hydroureter

size and location of the ureteral mass (Reichle et al. 2003;

function of the normal kidney if one is considering

Prognosis
The prognosis for removal of benign ureteral masses is 
excellent (Burton et al. 1994; Reichle et al. 2003). The
 prognosis for removal of malignant ureteral masses is
variable. Two sarcomas showed subsequent evidence of
metastatic disease with survival times of 8 months and 6
months, respectively (Deschamps et al. 2007; Guilherme
et al. 2007). The other three previously reported malig-
nant ureteral tumors (leiomyosarcoma, transitional cell
carcinoma, mast cell tumor) did not result in death of the
patient for the follow-up times reported (Berzon 1979;
Hanika & Rebar 1980; Steffey et al. 2004).

fluids such as 0.9% sodium chloride are most frequently
recommended, the amount of potassium in potassium-

With stenting, ureteral reepithelialization is complete
in 4-10 days and regeneration of the mural layers occurs
in 4-6 weeks. Although other reports indicate that
unstented ureterotomies regenerate quickly and com-
pletely, most investigators have concluded that diversion
of urine complements wound healing (Bellah 1989).
Stenting in veterinary patients can be performed with an
internal nephroureterostomy or double-J stent, where a
loop of stent forms in both the renal pelvis and urinary
bladder, preventing dislodgement of the stent. A pigtail

In cases of severe loss of ureteral length or when
anastomosis cannot occur without undue tension, a

thickened and shows irregular edges with small

changes of the uterine glands (Figure 60-2). However, if
the uterus is severely distended, the uterine wall can
appear thinned.
Abdominal radiographs can be taken to confirm
uterine distension (Figure 60-3). Fetal skeletal ossifica-

with or without an opioid for analgesia (Evers 1968; Luna

since there is an increase in collateral circulation and
decreased epidural space. A 25-35% reduction in amount
of anesthetic administered is required compared with a
similarly sized nonpregnant animal (Pascoe & Moon
 2001). In addition, hypotension resulting from sympa-
thetic blockade by the epidural can be severe and
resistant to intravenous fluid boluses, necessitating the
use of pressors such as dobutamine (1-5 μg/kg per min,
constant-rate infusion) (Ryan & Wagner 2006a). An
epidural can be used without general anesthesia to have
the least effect on neonatal vigor; however, the dam is at
increased risk of hypoxemia, regurgitation, and aspira-
tion pneumonia since she is not intubated (Luna et al.

Surgical procedure
 The ventral abdomen is clipped and a preliminary scrub
performed prior to induction of general anesthesia. Care
is taken not to traumatize the nipples during prepara-
tion. Positioning of the dam in dorsal recumbency does
not cause aortocaval hypotension in dogs (Probst &
Webb 1983; Probst et al. 1987). The head of the dog is
kept no lower than the abdomen to prevent increased
 pressure on the diaphragm from the uterus and fetuses.

Paraphimosis

Paraphimosis is inability to completely withdraw the
penis into the prepuce (Somerville & Anderson 2001).
Paraphimosis is the opposite of phimosis, which is the
inability to extrude the penis from the prepuce (see
Chapter 71). Paraphimosis occurs 14 times more
frequently than phimosis (Kustritz & Olson 1999). It is

when presented with a priapism case is paraphimosis
(see Chapter 68). In priapism the penis will be firm,
whereas in paraphimsosis the penis will be flaccid
(Figure 69-2). The penile mucosa may be dry, inflamed,
excoriated, and is often dark red to purple in color
secondary to blood congestion. The male frequently
licks the penis because it is painful and self-mutilation
may occur. If neglected, the penis will become necrotic.
In the event of urethral obstruction, stranguria may be
present, which can progress to uremia secondary to
cystorrhexis ifleft untreated.

Phimosis 703
Diagnosis
(a)
 Other than by direct examination, the diagnosis can be
made using contrast radiography or ultrasonography.
Contrast radiography is accomplished by filling the
 preputial cavity with saline and then taking radiographs of
the penis and prepuce (Sarierler & Kara i998).
Ultrasonographic examination can largely achieve the
same results as contrast radiography. Ultrasonography
will allow the detection of adhesions between the penis
 and preputial mucosa that were not detected by palpation
through the preputialskin. When present, anyaccumulated
fluid inside the prepuce may be aspirated toverify thatit is
urine or to submit it for bacterial culture and sensitivity
testing in cases that suffer from significant balanoposthitis
 and require antimicrobial therapy in addition to correc-
tive surgery. The approach to the diagnosis of intraprepu-
tial tumors is discussed in Chapter 70.
(b)
Treatment
All  reported cases of phimosis required surgical
correction. In its simplest form, corrective surgery
involves the widening of an excessively narrow preputial
opening (Papazoglou & Kazakos 2002). A longitudinal,
full-thickness incision of 10-15 mm is made through
the dorsal aspect of the preputial ring. In extreme cases,
it may be necessary to excise a full-thickness V-shaped
wedge at the same location. The placement of the
incision at the ventral aspect of the preputial opening is
considered ill-advised as it may result in the persistent
exposure of the tip of the penis. The raw edges of the
incision are then closed by suturing the preputial
mucosal edge to the skin edge, resulting in a V-shaped
suture line (Figure 7l-1). The suture pattern can be
(c)
simple interrupted or simple continuous with nonab-
sorbable suture materials.
 In cases where adhesions are present between the
penis and the preputial mucosa, the preputial cavity
must be exposed through a mid-ventral longitudinal
incision that allows access to the adhesions, which are
then freed by blunt and sharp dissection (Saporito 2008).
Once separated, the defects in the penile and preputial
mucosa should be closed using absorbable suture
material. Leaving the defects open is likely to result in the
formation of new adhesions and recurrence of the
 problem.
 In cases of phimosis due to penile hypoplasia, the
 prepuce can be shortened so that the tip of the
shorter-than-normal penis comes to be positioned

Clinical signs
Many affected animals are asymptomatic and there has
[a]
been no demonstration that clinical signs are related to
the severity of the anatomic abnormality. Most of the
symptomatic animals are presented prior to 3 months of
age. Clinical signs include dyspnea, exercise intolerance,
lack of weight gain, hyperpnea, cyanosis, inappetence,
inability to walk or thoracic limb splaying, recurrent
pulmonary infections, mild upper respiratory disease,
mild  inspiratory S
stridor,  vomiting and  persistent
 productive cough. The disease process may be progres-
sive, as some cases have documented a worsening of
clinical signs following the initial presentation.
Diagnosis
Even asymptomatic patients have typically a visible or
palpable caudal sternal defect (Figure 73-2). Increased
inspiratory effort is evident in symptomatic patients.
Thoracic auscultation commonly denotes inspiratory
stridor, moist rales if infection is present, and a cardiac
murmur.
a
 Heart sounds are frequently muffled unilaterally due to
cardiac displacement, which is more frequently to the leff
in dogs and almost always to the left in cats.
Echocardiography must be used to rule out intrinsic
cardiac abnormalities when murmurs, cardiomegaly or
any cardiac abnormalities are noted. Baseline laboratory
data (complete blood count, serum biochemistries, urinal-
(b)
 ysis) are typically unremarkable in uncomplicated cases.
Thoracic radiography will show decreased thoracic
volume, especially on lateral projections, due to dorsal
displacement of the caudal sternum (Figure 73-3).
Objective assessment of the degree of the deformity has
 been made by determining the frontosagittal or vertebral
indexes (Figure 73-3) (Fossum et al. 1989a). However,
the severity of the clinical signs has not been shown to be
associated with the degree of deformity

index is calculated by dividing the width of the chest at the tenth

the ventral surface of the vertebral body nearest the deformity

fields should be assessed for the presence of pneumonia
or other abnormalities.
Treatment
The variable expression of PE (i.e., degree of pathologic
involvement) results in a variety of treatment options.
The technique selected may be dictated by the presence
of clinical signs, severity of the defect, age of the animal,
rigidity of the costal arches, and ability to retract the
sternal defect.
Conservative management
Young animals with mild PE or a flat chest may develop
a normal or near-normal chest wall without surgical
intervention. However, lateral-to-medial compression of
the chest should not be used with more severe cases of
 PE because this may exacerbate dorsal intrusion of the
sternum into the thoracic cavity. It remains undeter-
mined whether an asymptomatic animal with moderate
or severe PE should undergo a corrective surgical
 procedure; however, the owners should be advised that
 the disease process may be progressive.
Surgery
In the majority of cases, an external splinting technique
can be used to correct the sternal defect and alleviate the

and vicryl mesh are also used to reconstruct chest wall
defects in people (Sabanathan et al. 1997; Incarbone &
Pastorino 2001; Skoracki & Chang 2006). The ideal
characteristics of prosthetic material for chest wall
 reconstruction include rigidity, malleability, inertness,
radiolucency, and resistance to infection (Trostle &
Rosin 1994; Mansour et al. 2002; Losken et al. 2004).
Marlex mesh is constructed of knitted nonabsorbable
monofilament polypropylene (Trostle & Rosin 1994).
 Marlex mesh has a high tensile strength and low perme-
ability to liquids and gases (Trostle & Rosin 1994;
Bowman et al. 1998). By 6 months, Marlex mesh is incor-
porated with no loss of tensile strength or fragmentation
of mesh material (Usher & Gannon 1959; Watkins &
Gerard 1960; Parrish et al. 1978).
 Prolene mesh is often preferred to Marlex mesh in
 humans, despite both being constructed from polypro-
pylene, because prolene mesh is constructed from

(i.e., accumulation of chyle in the pleural space) and does

CCA has been applied in combination with TDL in the
studies to date and has not been examined as a
 stand-alone procedure. The therapeutic goals of CCA
are to (i) detach the lymphatic drainage pathways of the

and thereby reduce the impetus for development of col-

Spontaneous pneumothorax
 Spontaneous pneumothorax can be further classified as
either primary or secondary based on the underlying
cause or condition of the lung and whether a lesion is
clinically apparent or not (Noppen & De Keukeleire
2008). Knowledge of the many various causes of
spontaneous pneumothorax aids in the clinical
management of affected animals; however, determining
the underlying cause is highly dependent on the type and
accuracy of the particular diagnostic tests (i.e., survey
radiography, CT, thoracoscopy, lung biopsy, bronchial
lavage) used to assess the lungs. In addition, classification
of the underlying cause as either primary or secondary
can be somewhat controversial or a matter of semantics,
 even with definitive histopathologic information (Cheng
et al. 2009). Various causes of spontaneous pneumo-
thorax include migrating or inhaled foreign bodies,

High-flow shunts can also trigger progressive pulmonary

hypertension and reversal of shunt flow (Eisenmenger

and accelerates the development of pulmonary hyper-
tension. Aortic insufficiency can develop as a secondary

durability. Valve repair is technically difficult and results
(a)
 are dependent on surgeon experience.
Valve replacement has the advantage of being
technically easier to perform than valve repair.
Additionally, it provides more predictable complete
 correction of regurgitation. The disadvantage of valve
replacement is the requirement for a valve prosthesis and
the associated shortcomings. Valve prosthesis options
are either a glutaraldehyde-fixed bioprosthetic valve or a
mechanical valve. Bioprosthetic valves have the principal
advantage of lower thrombogenicity. Anticoagulation
 therapy with warfarin is necessary for 3months after
surgery (Bonow et al. 2008). Mechanical valves have
excellent durability, but are thrombogenic and require
lifetime anticoagulation therapy (Bonow et al. 2008). Of
the available designs, the bileaflet tilting disk design is
currently favored because of superior flow characteristics
and lower thrombogenicity (Vongpatanasin et al. 1996).

monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR)
based on the prothrombin time (Triplett 1998). A target
INR of 2.0-3.0 is recommended in humans after mitral
valve replacement (Bonow et al. 2008). Because of size
limitations in currently available valve prostheses, valve
replacement is generally limited to dogs 10kg or larger.
Mitral valve replacement
Mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve is
currently favored over replacement with a mechanical
prosthesis in dogs with severe mitral regurgitation
because of the risk of valve prosthesis thrombosis and
the limitations of long-term anticoagulation in dogs
(Orton et al. 2005). Mitral valve replacement can be
undertaken in the dog through either a right or left tho-
racotomy via the fifth intercostal space. A left thora-
(c)
cotomy generally provides better access to the mitral
valve and is preferred in most cases. Standard femoral
arterial cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass is
employed. With left thoracotomy, venous cannulation is
accomplished with a two-stage cannula passed through
the right atrial appendage. Approach to the mitral valve
is via a left lateral atriotomy. With a right thoracotomy,
standard bicaval venous cannulation is employed. Access
to the mitral valve is through the left atrium dorsal to the

Treatment
If cardiac tamponade is due to excessive pericardial fluid,
pericardiocentesis or cystocentesis is required before
surgery. Median sternotomy facilitates exploration of the
 thoracic cavity, resection of the pericardial cyst, subtotal
 pericardectomy, and repair of peritoneopericardial dia-
phragmatic hernia if needed. The prognosis is good if
the cyst can be removed completely.

Treatment
 Subtotal or complete pericardectomy is the treatment
of choice for constrictive pericarditis when the parietal
pericardium is involved (Figure 85-1). A median
sternotomy is recommended to visualize both side of
the heart during the dissection. The clinical outcome
of the procedure is expected to be favorable. However,
if the epicardium is involved, decortication of the
affected tissue is required and the prognosis is more
guarded (Figure 85-2). Laceration of a coronary
artery, pulmonary thromboembolism, and arrhyth-
mias are possible complications of cardiac decortica-
