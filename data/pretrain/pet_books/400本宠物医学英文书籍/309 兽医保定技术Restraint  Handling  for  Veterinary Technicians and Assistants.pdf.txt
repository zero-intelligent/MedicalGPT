Preface
Techniques of restraint are applied in the everyday working lives of veterinary technicians and DVMs.
Great care must be taken to ensure the safety of the animals being cared for as well as to maintain
your safety and that of the coworkers you are handling the animals with.
The material in each chapter is presented in a uniform and easily understandable format.
A deviation from the standard prose format has been adopted, intentionally, to provide concise
answers to critical questions everyone has related to the techniques of restraint: "what do I need
to do, and what can go wrong?" The goal of the book is to provide these answers in a clinically
accessible format, eliminating the need to wade through more traditional texts.
With this goal in mind, the text is constructed such that the purpose for each procedure is
the step-by-step instructions for performing each procedure. Finally, procedural instructions are
augmented by short explanatory statements or comments.

Principles of Restraint in Veterinary Practice  Chapter 1
Principles of Restraint
 Restraint is defined as forcible confinement; in veterinary practice it is the forc-
ible confinement of an animal within the practice's care. Veterinary technicians and
assistants will be using restraint techniques every day in their professional lives. It
is a skill that takes practice to master and to feel confident performing. The goal of
restraint is to handle an animal in such a way that a procedure can be done without
injuring the animal and without causing any injury to the humans involved in the
 procedure. It should always be the objective of the restrainer to never let the person
performing the procedure get hurt. Anyone who is performing a procedure wants to
be able to concentrate on the task at hand and not have to worry about what the
animal is doing. A technician or assistant should have the attitude that "no one will
get hurt while I am restraining the animal." The potential for serious injury is ever
present.
 Because the veterinary facility is liable for any injury an owner sustains from
their pet, owners should not be allowed to perform restraint. It goes without saying
that the average owner is not likely trained in proper restraint techniques.
Different animals require different restraint techniques. For example, cats usu-
ally do well with minimal restraint, whereas a dog typically requires more control.
friendly dog may require less restraint than a fearful or aggressive dog.
sa rao siad an jo  un uad  e are san a
others are not as they may look harsh. For example, the cat "stretch" restraint
technique, while not harmful to the cat, may be viewed by the owner as cruel.
Different restraint techniques are required for the performance of veterinary
procedures. For example, an unpleasant procedure such as a rectal examination
will require more restraint than auscultation of the heart. Certain procedures
require special techniques. For example, the restraint for obtaining blood from the
 jugular vein is vastly different than that required for venipuncture of the medial
saphenous vein.
In all situations, regardless of species, one must have patience. If a restrainer is
in a bad mood or is pressed for time, this could make a difficult situation worse.
Animals in a Veterinary Facility
An animal in a veterinary facility may not be the animal that its owner knows
at home. The normally calm animal may be excited. An animal that never shows
aggressive tendencies in its day-to-day life may be aggressive in the clinic. An
animal may appear perfectly calm but then lash out when a clinic employee tries to
handle it. Although the profession of veterinary medicine is chosen by individuals
who love animals, caution must be taken whenever a strange animal is approached
in the veterinary clinic. Much of the adverse behavior seen is born out of fear,
strange surroundings, and unusual scents. With time and experience, veterinary

clinic. Although not within the scope of this text, a study of the basic behavior of
the animals to be worked with is essential to ensuring safe encounters with patients.
Behavior resources are listed at the end of the chapter. The bottom line is that all
 rad h f a n  pe a pr s
Precautions should be taken to make sure that the animal does not escape from
the clinic if it escapes the restraint technique. If a procedure is being performed
in a treatment room, all doors should be closed. This is also true if the procedure
is performed in an examination room. Doors to rooms adjoining the one where the
restraint is being performed should be closed as well.

safety. Be aware that certain animals in certain situations cannot be adequately
restrained regardless of the level of experience the restrainer has. This is when the
decision to use tranquilization or sedation comes into play.
Animal restraint is one of the most important skills a technician and assistant
should possess. Being a master at restraint is a trait that will be valued in a veteri-
nary clinic. Practice makes perfect!
Complications of Restraint
Restraint is required for proper transportation, examination, and treatment of any
animal species. The degree of restraint required reflects the species, the animal's
familiarity with handling., anticipated invasiveness, and the duration of the proce-
dure. It is the handler's responsibility to use techniques that facilitate the success
and safety of all humans and animals involved in a procedure. Unfortunately, despite
all attempts to minimize complications, restraint can adversely affect some animals.
Undesirable effects that can be associated with restraint include:
● Trauma, including contusions, bruising. lacerations, and nerve paralysis
 Metabolic disturbances such as acidosis, hypoxia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia.

·Hyperthermia
 Regurgitation

The Use of Restraint Tools in Small Animal
Practice
There are many tools at a veterinary technician or assistant's disposal to restrain
animals. Some can be purchased through veterinary supply companies. Other
restraint devices can be made from materials commonly found in a veterinary hospi-
tal. For example, a large towel can be used as a capture and/or restraint device when
dealing with a cat or a small dog. A roll of gauze can be used to make a muzzle if a
leather or nylon one is not available. Doors in the hospital can be used as a squeeze
cage. While not featured in this chapter, there are many different types of devices
that can be purchased such as the "clam shell", capture net, and grasper to catch
and restrain cats. The most common restraint methods and devices used in veteri-
 nary practices are explained here.
The goal of using restraint devices is to make dealing with the animal safer for
the restrainer and avoid injury to the animal being restrained. Interestingly. in many

A noose leash is a single piece of nylon or rope with a ring on one end and a handle
at the other. The handle end is fed through the ring to make the noose, which goes
around the animal's neck. A noose leash is used to walk a dog or to remove a dog or

imity to the technician's face!
The noose leash can be used to remove a dog from a cage or run. This is especially
helpful if the veterinary technician is not sure that the animal is friendly enough to
touch or if the dog is too large to lift out of the enclosure. Note that this technique
can also be used to remove fractious cats from a cage.
PROCEDURE
Using a Noose Leash to Remove a Dog From an Enclosure
Technical Action
1. 0btain a noose leash.
 Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint 
Rationale/Amplification
1a. An example of a noose leash is shown in Figure 2-1a.
Figure 2-la: Noose leash.
Technical Action
 2. Make the loop on the noose leash big enough to fit
 around the head.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. You will need to "eyeball" this to guess the proper
size. See Figure 2-1b.
Figure 2-1b: Making a loop in the leash.
Technical Action
3. Open the cage door or run door just enough to slide
the noose leash loop in and over the dog's head.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. You only want to allow for the leash to fit in and not
the dog to escape. See Figures 2-1c and 2-1d.
Figure 2-1c: Opening the cage to get the
leash over the dog's head.
Restraint Tools and Techniques for Small Animals  Chapter 2
Figure 2-1d: Placing the leash around the
dog's neck.
 Technical Action
4. Once the dog's head is in the noose, tighten it and
open the door, allowing the dog to exit the enclosure.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. See Figure 2-1e.
4b. Getting the dog's head in the noose may take a
couple of attempts if the dog is fearful, aggressive, 0r
uncooperative.
Figure 2-1e: Leading the dog out of the
cage.
Returning a Dog to an Enclosure Using a Noose Leash
Once a procedure is finished, the dog will need to be returned to its cage or run.
 This may require that the dog be lifted into the cage if it won't walk in voluntarily.
PROCEDURE
Returning a Dog to an Enclosure Using a Noose Leash
Technical Action
1. Walk the dog to the cage or run.
10
 Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint 
Technical Action
2. Open the door and see if the dog will walk in
voluntarily.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. See Figure 2-2a.
2b. If it will not, you may need to give a gentle verbal
 command to encourage it or lift the front limbs into the
enclosure.
Figure 2-2a: Leading the dog into the cage.
Technical Action
 3. Let the dog enter the cage, holding the leash with
one hand.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. See Figure 2-2b.
Figure 2-2b: Encouraging the dog to step up into the cage.
Technical Action
4. Once the dog is in the cage, holding the door with
one hand, use your other hand to remove the leash from
the dog's head.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. The door should be held open only enough to get
the leash off. If the door is opened too wide, the dog
may try to escape. See Figure 2-2c.
4b. If the dog is unfriendly, you may need to try to
loosen the leash so that the noose will come off without

touching the dog.
Technigue for Removing a Noose Leash from a Fractious Dog
This technique allows a restrainer to use a noose leash with another one attached, which
is used to remove the leash when the dog is too aggressive to remove it with your hands.
Restraint Tools and Techniques for Small Animals  Chapter 2
11
PROCEDURE
Removing a Noose Leash From a Fractious Dog
Technical Action
1. You will need two noose leashes.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. The green leash will be the one that goes around
the dog's neck. The orange leash is the one that will be
attached for removal of the green leash. See Figure 2-3a.
Fgure 2-3a: The green leash is the one that
will be around the dog's neck. The orange 
leash will be used to remove the green
one. Note that the orange leash is looped
through the ring on the green one.
Technical Action
 2. You need to make a noose leash out of the orange
leash.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. See Figure 2-3b.
Figure 2-3b: Making a loop with the
orange leash.
Technical Action
3. Tighten the orange noose leash all the way down on
to the ring on the green leash.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. This will enable you to remove the green leash by
pulling on the orange leash. See Figure 2-3c.
Figure 2-3c: The orange leash is now tight-
ened down on the ring of the green leash.
12
Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint 
Technical Action
4. Place the green noose leash around the dog's neck.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. Note that at this point you will have both leashes in
your hand. See Figure 2-3d.
Figure 2-3d: The green leash is placed
 on the dog and the restrainer is holding
both leashes in his hand.
Technical Action
5. To remove the green noose leash, release the green
one while pulling on the orange one.
Rationale/Amplification
5a. See Figure 2-3e.
5b. Although not shown, this technique is used to
remove a leash from an aggressive dog that you have
placed in a cage or run.
Figure 2-3e: The green leash is dropped
while holding on to the orange one. This
in a real situation could be used when
an aggressive dog is led back in a cage or
run and you cannot touch it to get the
leash off. The orange leash is pulled to
 remove the green one.
Using a Noose Leash to Restrain a Dog Behind a Door
This technique is used when a fractious dog requires an injection in the rear limb
and the dog is uncooperative. Three people are required for this procedure. You will
need an assistant, plus someone to give the injection.
Note: This technique should not be performed in front of an owner.
Restraint Tools and Techniques for Small Animals  Chapter 2
13
PROCEDURE
Using a Noose Leash to Restrain a Dog Behind a Door
Technical Action
1. Place the noose leash around the dog's neck.
 Rationale/Amplification
1a. You will need an assistant for this, plus someone to give the injection. In total, three people are required.
Technical Action
 2. Use a run door.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. The door of an exam room or treatment room could also be used.
Technical Action
3. Lead the dog into the corner where the run door
 meets the wall and feed the leash through the hinge
side of the door.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. See Figure 2-4a.
3b. If using an exam room door, the dog would be led to
the hinge side of the door that will be opening into the
room. The leash will then be fed through the hinge to
an assistant. The assistant will pull the leash to get the

as possible.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. See Figure 2-4b.
Figure 2-4b: Pulling the leash to bring
the dog up to the hinge.
Technical Action
5. An assistant will need to swing the run door tightly
toward the wall, up against the dog.
Rationale/Amplification
5a. This will make a modified "squeeze cage." See
Figure 2-4c.
5b. If using the exam room door, after you have handed
the leash to your assistant, you can now push the door
up close to the dog.

squeezed behind the door will struggle, and choking the
dog must be prevented.
Technical Action
6. Another assistant will then come behind to give the injection in the hind limb.
Rabies Pole
The rabies pole is also known as a restraint pole or capture pole. Although munici-
pal rabies control officers and shelter employees might have the occasion to use
these often, veterinary hospitals use these only as a last resort. This device has a
rigid pole with a noose attached to allow the restrainer distance and security away
from the animal. Note: This should never be used in the presence of an owner.
The rabies pole is used to capture a dog or cat when you cannot put your hands

to allow for a physical examination or treatment to the animal.
Restraint Tools and Techniques for Small Animals  Chapter 2
PROCEDURE
Using the Rabies Pole
 Technical Action
1. This technique is used to capture an aggressive loose
dog or cat.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. In this case, the rabies pole is used instead of the
a dog or cat from an enclosure or put one in an
enclosure. See Figure 2-5a.
Figure 2-5a: Rabies pole.
Technical Action
2. Once the noose is around the neck, quickly tighten it.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. Anyone using this pole should familiarize them-
selves with the tightening mechanism of the noose
before using it. See Figure 2-5b.
2b. Expect the animal to act violently to this maneuver.
They will likely twist and flail.
Figure 2-5b: Capturing the dog with the
noose.
Technical Action
3. You should hold the pole at its maximum length
firmly with both hands to give yourself distance from
the dog or cat.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. See Figure 2-5c.
Figure 2-5c: Correctly holding the rabies
pole.
16
Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint 
Technical Action
4. You can now lead the animal to an enclosure or to a door to use it for restraint.
Blankets and Towels
 Blankets and towels are used to throw over an uncooperative animal in a cage or on
an exam table. This technique can be used to provide a visual barrier so the animal
cannot see what's coming next. Blankets and towels can also be used to gain control
of a dog or cat to protect the hands from being bitten.
PROCEDURE
Using a Blanket or Towel
Technical Action 
1. Obtain a large towel free of holes.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. Feet can get caught in the holes.
1b. If it is a thin towel, it should be folded over (doubled).
1c. A blanket of appropriate size can be used instead.
Technical Action
2. Open the cage door and throw the towel over the cat's
(or dog's) body, including the head.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. This needs to be done in one swift movement.
See Figure 2-6a.

Leather Gloves
Most veterinary hospitals have a pair of leather gloves; however, they are rarely
used. These should be used only as a last resort as these alone can be frightening to
an animal. Use of leather gloves:
 Allows a restrainer to put their hands on a very aggressive small dog or cat
when all other restraint options have been exhausted.
 Protects the restrainer's hands from being bitten.
 Allows a small dog or cat to be removed from a cage or from a crate of which
the top has been removed, or a loose animal to be picked up off the floor.
PROCEDURE
Using Leather Gloves
Technical Action
1. Put the gloves on your hands. Put one on without
pushing the fingers to the end of the glove. Don the
other glove completely.
Rationale/Am plification
1a. They are "one size fits all." See Figure 2-7a.
1b. By allowing the end of one glove to dangle at the
end of your fingers, you can use this as a mode of
distraction with the animal. If the animal should try to

3. Once the neck is grasped, the animal can be lifted using the other hand for support.
Technical Action
4. The animal can now be taken to wherever it needs to go.
Cat Bag
A cat bag is useful for restraint because it prevents the cat from scratching. The
 head is still exposed, however. These bags are typically made of nylon. The cat bag is
used to:
· Restrain a cat so that personnel do not get scratched.
● Provide access to specific areas of the body through various zippered openings
allowing for injections or venipuncture.
· To provide restraint while anesthetizing a cat with an anesthetic mask.

Restraint of the Dog
Most dogs are very accustomed to being handled. In a veterinary clinic, restraint is
required to accomplish procedures such as a physical examination, venipuncture,
A am pd aq m ad e s si d 'n  e 
to the dog or the humans performing the procedure.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Dog
The dog can be easy to work with and most are fairly cooperative participants in
procedures due to their desire for human companionship and experience with han-
dling. However, the guidelines below should be followed:
·Always introduce yourself to the dog first before doing anything. Speak to the
dog in a friendly. calm voice. Use the dog's name when you talk to it. When
you approach the dog. present one hand with the palm down. Allow the dog
to come to you rather than advancing on the dog. If the dog is friendly. it will
come to you and you should see a wagging tail. It may even lick your hand.
This is a positive sign that the dog will likely cooperate with basic restraint.
·It is helpful when handling a dog to determine if it has had any obedience
training by asking it to sit or stand. If it responds to commands this can make
restraint easier. If for example it responds to the command to sit, then forcing
it to sit will not be necessary.
·Realize that the type of restraint may be dictated by how comfortable with a
certain technique the animal is. Some dogs are very stoic and will not react to
a procedure that may be uncomfortable. Less forceful restraint might be what is
required. On the other hand, some dogs become very excited just seeing a pair
of nail clippers. These dogs may need more than one restrainer. In both cases.
restraint such that the other person doesn't get hurt is paramount.
· The goal should always be that the restraint and the procedure can be performed in
such a way that it is atraumatic and non-stressful to everyone including the dog.
· Some dogs cooperate much better out of sight of the owner. In those cases, one
may ask (or tell) the owner that the dog will be taken back to the treatment
area for venipuncture for a heartworm test, for example, and returned to the
exam room when finished.
●Rewarding the dog with a treat after the procedure ends the experience on a
positive note.
     Ann    sd n  s
are undesirable complications to the pet associated with restraint, which veterinary
technicians and assistants need to be aware of and avoid at all costs. These include:
● Trauma to the patient such as sprains and muscle soreness due to excessive force
 Hyperthermia from excessive struggle and excitement
 Dyspnea (labored breathing) especially in brachycephalic (short, broad head)
breeds
 Proptosis (displacement) of the eye due to excessive force around the neck of
dogs with protruding eyes (i.e., pugs)
·Emotional stress
The health status of the dog may predispose it to pain and injury during restraint.
Obviously a dog with a previous back injury will require gentle handling. Arthritic
 dogs necessitate special consideration since many areas of their body may be painful
restraint so as not to put them in respiratory distress.
34
Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint
Injury to restrainers is possible as well. Scratches from struggling or kicking can
 occur during handling. Bites are also an inherent danger. Lifting a heavy dog improp-
erly can cause back injury. Personnel should never try to impress others by lifting an
animal that is too heavy. Large dogs should be lifted using two people, one for the
front end and the other for the back end. Do not be too proud to ask for help.
There may be situations in which the most experienced restrainers cannot get
a patient to cooperate for a procedure using proper restraint techniques. In these
cases the chance of injury to the patient or personnel increases. In these cases it is
in the best interest of the patient and personnel to use chemical restraint.

as a physical examination, injections, venipuncture, ophthalmic examinations, and
so on. This can be performed with the dog on the examination table or on the floor.
The location chosen is determined by the person performing the procedure and the
animal itself. For example, if the dog is extremely large, having it stand on the table
may make it "too tall" to reach to perform proper restraint or for the other person to
perform the procedure at hand. Alternatively, some dogs may be uncooperative on
an examination table but become totally cooperative on the floor.

2a. The dog could also be placed in lateral recumbency from a sternal position
Technical Action
3. Place your right arm across the dog's neck and reach
between the front legs to grasp the dog's right forelimb
in your right hand.
Rationale/Amplification
 3a. This will place the dog in right lateral recumbency.
See Figure 3-6a.
3b. If the dog is in sternal recumbency, the right front
limb will not be exposed for easy access so grasping the
right forelimb will be more difficult.

Technical Action
4. Place your left arm over the dog's back, reaching for the dog's right rear limb. Grasp the limb just proximal
to the hock.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. If the dog is in sternal recumbency, the right rear limb will be tucked under the dog and will be more
difficult to grasp.
Technical Action
5. With the dog's body close to yours, gently lift
the limbs while allowing the dog's body to move to
the table. It should now be on its right side.
Rationale/Amplification

6. Allow the dog to relax for a couple of seconds, not releasing the limbs from your grasp. Your right arm can
now be used to place pressure on the dog's neck if needed for more control.
Technical Action
7. If the dog is large, two people may be required for this
restraint. One person would be in control of the front
limbs, while the other would control the hind limbs.
Rationale/Amplification
7a. See Figures 3-6c and 3-6d.

Technical Action
4. Hold the dog's left forelimb with its elbow in the palm of your hand and extend the limb forward toward the
person performing the procedure.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. At this point, the other person should grasp the leg to prepare the site for the venipuncture.
Technical Action
5. With the elbow in your palm, rotate your thumb
up so it is on top of the limb at the bend of the elbow
(where the radius meets the humerus). Pushing down
with the thumb, rotate it to the left.

PROCEDURE
Restraint of the Dog for Jugular Venipuncture
Technical Action
1. Place a noose leash on the dog.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. This gives you control of the dog if you need it. The noose leash will need to be moved up toward the
dog's jaw so it is out of the way during the procedure or it may need to be removed.
Technical Action
 2. Place the dog in a sitting position.
Rationale/Amplification
 2a. This restraint can also be done with the dog in sternal recumbency or standing position, depending on
the size of the dog. With large dogs, sometimes this restraint is best done on the floor with the dog in
the sitting position.

Technical Action
3. Hold the head up. away from the chest. This can be
 achieved by cupping your hand underneath the muzzle
and by pushing the head up toward the ceiling.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. The person doing the procedure will direct the exact
 position of the head for maximum visualization of the
vein. The vein in this picture is outlined in black. See
Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-9: In this photograph, the jugu-
lar vein is between the black lines. The

showing this vein. It is not routine for
the area to be shaved for venipuncture.
Technical Action
4. Your other arm should be wrapped over the dog's back.
Technical Action
5. For a small dog. it may be necessary to hold the dog right at the edge of the table, holding the head up
as described above and using the other hand to grasp both front legs and extend them down off the edge
of the table.
Rationale/Amplification
5a. Pulling the legs down and tilting the head up provides visualization of the vein. This technique does not
provide the best restraint of the dog's body.

Restraint of the Cat
Someone once said that cats are not small dogs. This is an understatement when it
comes to restraining cats. Although cats are accustomed to handling just as the dog
is, the difficulty lies in the fact that cats are not typically accustomed to traveling
and to being in strange places. Rarely are cats taken for car rides to the park on a
sunny day. By the time the cat gets to the clinic, it is already upset by the car ride
getting there. Then, it is brought into a strange place. To add insult to injury. the
cat is typically facing other cats, dogs, and strange smells the moment it reaches the
long way in providing the empathy required to successfully perform procedures on it.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Cat
Some say there is an art to handling cats. Those who are successful in handling cats
as gs e  s   i g b iq e 
when in groups, they are not social to humans in the same ways dogs are. The
following guidelines should make interactions easier and safer:
●Minimal restraint should always be used unless the cat's behavior forces you to
do otherwise. Do not automatically assume the worst with a cat. There are some
  e rg    n n s
●Always introduce yourself to the cat before performing any procedure. This is
accomplished by using a low voice, talking to the cat by its name. Extend your
hand palm down, and allow the cat to sniff it. Taking an aggressive stance with
the cat right off the bat can start the procedure off on the wrong foot and set
a negative tone for the rest of the procedure and the cat's stay at the clinic.
· Cats typically give subtle warnings that they are getting upset before they
attack. Restrainers should be observant of these. For example, if a cat is
may rotate rearward. As their agitation increases, they will flick the end of
their tail. As agitation increases, the tail ficking can become more forceful
to the point where it can be heard tapping on the examination table. Some
cats will emit a low-pitched growl. These are all warnings that the cat has had
enough. At this point, one needs to hurry and finish the procedure or apply
more restraint.
●All means of escape need to be considered when a cat is handled. Doors.
closets, and cabinets need to be closed!
·Sometimes just scruffing a cat will be all the restraint that is required. This
involves grasping the skin around the base of the neck just as mother cats do to
carry and reprimand their kittens. The amount of force applied with the scruff
depends on the attitude of the cat. Some cats require quite a strong hold during
a procedure, while others will cooperate for procedures with a light scruff.
· If a cat is scruffed and begins to become agitated, a distraction technique may
help. Tapping the cat on the top of the head may put its mind on something
else. If that doesn't help. sometimes simply placing a towel over the cat's head
will quiet the cat down.
· If a cat is brought into the examination room in a crate, the best thing to do is
allow it to walk out on its own. If the cat is friendly but does not want to come
out, you can grab it by the scruff and pull it out. This cannot be done with an
 agitated cat. The crate may need to be disassembled first, removing the top.
·For cats that are particularly fearful, dimming the lights in the examination
room may help.
54
 Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint 
 Make sure that everything you need for the procedure about to be performed is
available. You may not have much time if the cat becomes agitated.
Cats can infict serious wounds with bite wounds to hands being the most
common. For this reason, extreme caution should be taken with all cats but
particularly with agitated or feral cats. Bite wounds to hands can end a career
in veterinary medicine.
 There will be times when chemical restraint will be the only option for
restraining an aggressive cat. Pride should not get in the way of its use. This
approach will be the kindest for the patient and the safest for personnel.

is important with these pets as well. Owners in many cases will be willing to spend
expect veterinary professionals to be knowledgeable about their particular type
of pet. In addition, an owner will expect the clinic personnel to show the same
compassion toward their budgie as one would show toward a dog.
A general rule to follow when handling all exotic pets is that you have all the
necessary equipment and supplies needed for the procedure ready before the animal
is handled as some will not tolerate handling for long.
The following will give information on how to restrain some of the most
common exotic pets seen in small animal practice.
Restraint of the Ferret
Ferrets are popular exotic pets so they are typically very accustomed to handling.
Their mischievous playful nature, which is maintained throughout their life, makes
them endearing pets.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Ferret
 The following guidelines will help the technician and assistant in safely handling
this species.
●Ferrets are typically very easy to handle and are used to human contact. Their
playful, mischievous nature makes them an entertaining pet to own and see in
the clinic. Care must be taken when handling them during one of their playful
bouts so they do not spring off an examination table or out of a restrainers
hands.
it may be during play. it still hurts. One should be careful not to get the
feret's face near their own face. Having a ferret attached to your nose is
not pleasant!
· Ferrets can be scruffed just like one would scruff a cat if added control is
required.
When holding a feret, the hind end of its body should always be supported
and not allowed to dangle.
Complications
●Bites to personnel
·Back injury to the ferret

PROCEDURE
Restraint of the Ferret
Technical Action
1. With the ferret on an examination table, floor, or in a
AFETY
 cage, grasp it with one hand behind the front limbs.
WOUR
TRAT
Rationale/Amplification
1a. If using your right hand, your thumb should be
under the ferret's left front leg and your fingers under
the right front leg. Alternatively, the ferret can be
scruffed just like a cat and lifted. See Figure 5-1a.
Figure 5-1a: A ferret being restrained by
scruffing with support of the hind limbs.
Technical Action
2. Lift up the ferret and use your other hand to support the hind end of the ferret.
Technical Action
3. For someone to perform a physical examination, added restraint may need to be provided, which can be
accomplished by scruffing the ferret.

Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint
Rationale/Amplification
3a. Most ferrets will immediately yawn right after they
are scruffed. The person who is performing the physical
examination should take this opportunity to examine
the oral cavity. See Figure 5-1b.
 3b. This restraint can be used to perform such procedures
as giving injections, trimming nails, and cleaning ears.
Figure 5-1b: The ferret yawning as it is
being scruffed. This is an opportunity to
examine the oral cavity.
Restraint of the Rabbit
It is not uncommon to have a veterinary clinic that claims to be strictly a dog-cat
practice to be willing to see the occasional rabbit. Rabbits have historically been
popular pets due to their beauty and sweet, gentle nature. They come in many
different sizes from dwarf to large but all are restrained the same way.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Rabbit
a au uy nn pase aana are pue sad rndod ae sh
typically shy and easily startled so one must be calm and quiet when handling this
 species. The following guidelines should be helpful:
 A rabbit can easily become paralyzed by improper support of the hind limbs
when being held. Because of the strength of the hind limbs, they should always
be secured so the rabbit cannot kick and injure itself or the handler.
 Covering the rabbit's head so it cannot see is sometimes helpful in reducing the
stress that the rabbit is experiencing.
 For a particularly restless rabbit, it can be wrapped in a towel. This "bunny
burrito" technique gains control of the limbs so that the rabbit cannot scratch
the handler or injure itself from kicks from the hind limbs.
Restraint of Exotic Pets Chapter 5
73
●Rabbits have delicate ears and should never be used as a way to pick one up!
· Rabbits seldom bite but one should never assume that one wouldn't.
Occasionally an aggressive rabbit is encountered and they will not shy away
from using teeth for defense.
Complications
●Back injury or paralysis to the rabbit due to improper control of the hind limbs
during restraint
● Scratches to personnel from the rear claws due to improper control of the hind
limbs
●Bites to personnel
PROCEDURE
Restraint of the Rabbit
Technical Action
1. The rabbit should be approached calmly and quietly
Technical Action
2. The rabbit should be scruffed with one hand and the front end gently lifted.
Rationale/Amplification
 2a. If there is not adequate area to scruff and the rabbit is small enough, then the rabbit can be grasped
behind its forelimbs.
Technical Action
3. The other hand should immediately reach under the
hind limbs and hold them.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. This prevents the rabbit from kicking. See Figure 5-2a.
3b. The hind limbs should never be allowed to dangle.
Figure 5-2a: A rabbit being held so that
its hind limbs are secured.
74
Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint
Technical Action
4. If the rabbit needs to be carried to another location, the hand that is scruffing the rabbit can be tucked
under the opposite arm at the elbow. The rabbit's body is rested on the arm, with the other hand under it
holding the rear limbs.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. This covers the rabbit's head, thus blocking its view. See Figure 5-2a.
Technical Action 
5. A rabbit can be wrapped in a towel to create a "bunny
burrito." This is particularly helpful for very frightened,
uncooperative rabbits.
Rationale/Amplification
5a. This technique gains control of the limbs.
See Figure 5-2b.
5b. If returning a rabbit to a cage, the rear end should
always be placed in the cage first before the front end is
released.

creating a "bunny burrito."
Restraint of the Pet Bird
Many different types of birds are kept as pets. While small birds such as finches
and canaries are kept as pets, these are not as commonly seen in practice as the
different types of parrots. They range in size from the budgie to the macaw. Many
represent to owners not only an emotional investment but a monetary one as well.
Because some parrots such as the macaws are quite large, they can inflict serious
to practice handling small birds such as the budgie or cockatiel before attempting
to handle the larger types. Regardless of the type of bird, the restraint technique is
the same.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Pet Bird

and claws when restrained for procedures. Care must be taken that the head
is controlled to avoid being bitten. Even a small bird like the budgie can
inflict painful bites. The extent of injury possible with a large parrot goes
without saying.
Restraint of Exotic Pets Chapter 5
 Birds have a tremendous amount of strength in their claws and care needs to be
taken as to not have hands in the way of being grasped.
 Always ask the owner if the bird's wings are trimmed. Realize that trimmed
wings do not necessarily prevent flight. In many cases, it reduces flying ability
rather than completely eliminating it.
· If a bird is in a cage when restraint is attempted, remove all toys and any other
objects that might get in the way of trying to grasp the bird.
● If the bird is on the owner's shoulder, hand, or arm, always have them put the
bird on the examination table. Never take the bird from the owner as injury to
the owner or the restrainer may result, as birds can be very territorial about
their owners.
● The door(s) to the room in which the restraint is taking place must be closed.
Ideally, restraint of birds should be performed behind two closed doors to
provide added security against escape.
·The bird needs to be held in such a way that the head and specifically the
mandible is secured. This can be done with or without a towel depending on the
handler's level of experience. Leather gloves should never be used as it terrifies
the bird and sensitivity to the degree of pressure applied to the body is lost.
●  If a towel is used to catch and restrain a bird, a paper towel is adequate for
a budgie or a finch, whereas a bath towel may be needed for a macaw. The
towel serves more as a distracter for the bird and a confidence builder for the
restrainer rather than protection for the hands!
·The bird lacks a diaphragm and utilizes the free movement of its sternum to
breathe. During restraint, the bird's chest should not be compressed, as this will
cause dyspnea.
·If at any point the bird becomes stressed to the point of tachypnea or
dyspnea, the bird should be released immediately. Many birds have died just
from the sheer act of restraint. This is always a possibility if the bird is ill
upon presentation at the hospital. Some birds may be too ill to handle at all.
Complications
· Bites and scratches to personnel
● Respiratory distress due to stress from restraint or improper restraint
●Death to the bird
PROCEDURE
Restraint of the Pet Bird
Technical Action
1. The door to the room should be closed prior to restraint being attempted. If the restraint is occurring in a
treatment room, clinic employees need to be made aware of what is going on so no one inadvertently opens
the door. Ideally the handling of a bird should happen behind two closed doors to eliminate the possibility of
escape.
Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint
76
Technical Action
2. If the bird is in its cage, remove all toys and other items that can get in the way of catching the bird. If the
bird is on the owner's shoulder or other body parts, ask the owner to place the bird on the table.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. In some situations, the cage will have barely enough room for your hand, let alone trying to dodge objects.
2b. When trying to catch a bird in a cage, always try to grasp it when its beak is attached to a cage bar. Some
birds, in an attempt to prevent being caught, will lay on their backs in a defensive posture and use their claws
to protect themselves. Wait until the parrot gets up and try again.
 2c. The bird may fly away when placed on the examination table. Ultimately it may need to be caught on
the floor.
Technical Action
3. No matter where the bird is when you are attempting
to catch it, you need to come behind it and grasp it
right behind and below the head and immediately grasp
the body securing the wings to the torso with the other
hand. This technique can be performed with or without
a towel.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. The goal is to grasp the bird either at the bottom
of the mandible or just below it so the head is secure.

Restraint of the Guinea Pig
Guinea pigs are very popular due to their small size and gentle personalities. They
rarely bite and many love to be cuddled.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Guinea Pig
·Although typically friendly. guinea pigs have a tendency to startle easily. They
 should be approached calmly and quietly but assertively.
●They can be a bit difficult to catch in a cage as they may scurry to try to get
away.
● Guinea pigs are very vocal and may squeal or whistle when they are being
caught or restrained.
· They should be held with two hands, one around the chest and the other
 supporting the hind limbs.
· If a guinea pig is being examined on an examination table, it helps to have a
towel on the table for traction. Always have one hand on the pet at all times to
prevent it from jumping off the table.
·Guinea pigs seldom bite but one can get scratched by their rear claws.
Complications
●Scratches to personnel
·Bites to personnel
PROCEDURE
Restraint of the Guinea Pig
Technical Action
1. To restrain a guinea pig, it first must be caught.
Whether from a cage or an examination table, one hand
should grasp the guinea pig at the shoulders. While
gently lifting the hind limbs can be cupped with the
 other hand.
Rationale/Amplification
Figure 5-4a: Restraint of the guinea pig.
1a. Make sure the guinea pig is grasped gently but securely so it does not escape and fall to the floor.
See Figure 5-4a.
78
Unit 1  Small Animal Restraint
Technical Action
2. Once held, the hand holding the shoulders can be
 shifted so that the ventral chest is cupped. The hind
limbs are held with the other hand.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. See Figure 5-4b.
Figure 5-4b: This guinea pig is being
restrained with the forelimbs held in the left
hand and its hind limbs secured with the
right. Alternatively, to provide more control
for a more restless guinea pig, the left hand
 can be used to restrain the guinea pig by
placing the hand over the shoulders. In this
case, your hand will be over the top of the 
guinea pig with the index finger and thumb
directly behind the forelimbs. The right
hand will support the hind limbs as shown.

Finishing the End of a Rope
Whenever a rope is cut, it is important to do something with the raw end to prevent
it from unraveling. The simplest method is to tie a knot in the end, but that makes
the end bulky and difficult to manipulate. Whatever method you choose, make sure
it is appropriate for the intended use of the rope.
PROCEDURE
Finishing or Securing the End of a Rope
Technical Action
1. Tape the end.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. Using black electrician's tape, start wrapping the rope about 1cm (1/z inch) from the end with the tape.
1b. Pull very hard, hard enough to compress the strands of the rope.
1c. Continue up the rope for approximately 5cm (2 inches).
Technical Action
2. Whip the end.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. Select a thin piece of nylon string or cord about 30 cm (12 inches) long.
82
Unit 2  Large Animal Restraint
Rationale/Am plification
2b. Lay the cord on the rope in a U-shape, with the
bottom of the U about 5 cm (2 inches) from the end of
the rope and the arms of the U heading off the end of
the rope (see Figure 6-1a).
2c. Hold the loop of cord against the rope.
2d. Using the long arm of the cord, and starting about
1cm from the end of the rope, tightly wrap the rope

2e. When at least 2.5 cm (1 inch) of the rope is
covered, pass the long end of the cord through the loop
(see Figure 6-1c).
 2f. Pull the short end of the cord until the loop
disappears and the long end of the cord is sucked up
tight to the wraps (see Figure 6-1d).
2g. Cut both ends of the cord close to the wrap.

3. Burn the end.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. Done with a nylon rope.
3b. Hold a lighter flame to the raw end of the rope until the strands melt and curl back.
3c. Rotate the rope to get even coverage.
3d. Takes roughly 30 seconds to get complete and even melting up to 1cm up the rope.
3e. Tape may then be applied as above for a finished appearance.
Quick-Release Knot
This simple, easy-to-tie knot is used most frequently by horse people. The main
drawback to this knot is that it continues to tighten when the long end of the rope
is pulled on, which can sometimes make it difficult to release.
Purpose
●To tie a horse or llama to a hitching post, rail. or hook
● To allow the lead rope to be untied quickly and easily by simply pulling on the
free end

4. Pull the bight to tighten the knot.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. Animals learn quickly to untie this knot by pulling the short end, so you can pass the short end
through the bight.
Bowline
The bowline is probably the first knot learned by those who work around boats and
water, because no matter how much force is pulled against it, it can still be untied.
It's named such because this knot has been used for centuries to secure the tug line
to the bow of a boat.
Purpose
Used to make a fixed-diameter loop
·Easily released even when pulled extremely tight, so used for securing an ani-
mal to a post or for dragging a dead animal
PROCEDURE
Tying a Bowline
Technical Action
Make a loop in the long end of the rope such that the short
end of the rope overlaps the long end (see Figure 6-3a).

Tomfool Knot
Named for the way the knot disappears if the free ends are pulled, the tomfool knot
is handy to know when you need to secure or hobble the feet of an animal. Tied
correctly. the knot will hold fast without cutting off the circulation, even if the
animal struggles against it.
Purpose
●Used to tie two legs together

Tail Tie
Ropes often are tied to a horse's tail to help us maneuver the animal more
effectively. Horses have very strong tails that can support their body weight. Cattle.
on the other hand, have very weak tails that may be broken or even pulled off if
tied by the tail.
Purpose
Used to lift or move the back end of a recumbent or ataxic horse
Used in horses to link one horse to another, head to tail (as in a pack string)
Used in horses to tie the tail out of the way
May be used in cattle only to hold the tail out of the way. never to lift or move

Braiding an Eye Splice
Placing an eye splice at the end of a rope makes it useful for many situations requir-
ing a slip loop. Once having accomplished the braiding technique, you will be able to
splice ropes together or finish off the end of the rope by braiding back.
Purpose
To create a permanent loop in the end of a rope that can withstand a great deal
of force

Rope Halters
In large animal medicine, it is common to make your own halters, especially for
cattle. Building your own halter not only saves you money but makes it possible
to have on hand halters that are a variety of weights and sizes. Horse halters are
the restraint procedures. Knowing how to build a temporary rope halter, however, is
extremely useful when you need to restrain a horse that has been injured and has
no halter immediately available.
Purpose
●Restraint or control of the heads of sheep. goats, or cattle
· Leading cattle, sheep. goats, and horses
·Tying cattle, sheep. or goats to a fixed object

Restraint of the Horse
Horses are the large animal most accustomed to handling. Whether it involves
haltering. grooming. or transportation, frequent handling is a component of
all equine husbandry protocols.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Horse
The ability to work cooperatively with horses takes many years to develop. The follwing
guidelines, however, will help the inexperienced handler avoid many problems:
●Horses are large herd animals. Their general approach is to run first and ask
questions later. Thus, most accidents involving equines are the result of
nervous, not aggressive, behavior on the horse's part. Having said that, horses
that choose to do so can infict extensive damage via biting. kicking (horses
most often kick caudally). and striking (using the front limbs).
●Always let horses know that you are in the area. Horses do not appreciate
surprises. Speak calmly; avoid loud noises and sudden movement.
·When standing near a horse, place your hand gently on the animal. This will
alert you to any pending movement on the horse's part.
·Never go under a horse.
●Never stand directly behind in the blind spot of a horse.
●If you must walk behind the horse, walk very close to the horse with your
body touching the animal. Alternatively, you can walk behind at a distance of
15 feet from the hind end.
· Do not permit yourself to be pinned or squeezed between the horse and a solid
object. For example, do not stand between the horse and the wall. Change
positions such that the horse is between you and the wall.
●Horses occasionally will cow kick (kick cranially with a hind limb) or strike
using a forelimb.
● Most handler accidents occur when the horse is placed in a confined area
(stock, trailer) or is within physical contact distance of another horse. Pay
close attention in these situations.
Horse Behavior
Unmanageable situations can often be avoided by correctly reading the emotions of
 a horse. Ears pinned backward often indicate anger or a warning. These signs warn
handlers that they may be bitten or kicked. Ears forward show interest or suspicion.
 Eyes and nostrils also show emotion and reflect temperament. Dilated nostrils reflect
interest, curiosity. or apprehension. When the eyes flash, nostrils dilate, and muscles
tense, the horse is likely about to react. Figure 7-1 outlines some of the common
cues to look for in a horse's behavior.
Rules of Tying
To facilitate safety of both horses and handlers, the following guidelines should be
adhered to when tying horses:
·Always use a quick-release knot.
●Secure to solid post or hitching rack. Never tie to gates, fence rails, or any
object that a frightened animal could pull apart.

 3. Walk horse into stock while you remain outside just to the left of the stock.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. If the horse refuses to enter, the handler can precede the horse into the stock. Be certain that the front of
the stock is open before attempting this.
3b. Do not look at the horse as you approach the stock. Keep looking forward.
3c. Many horses will halt 3 feet from the stock. Allow them to quietly assess the situation for 2-3 minutes,
then cluck to encourage forward movement.
106
Unit 2  Large Animal Restraint
Technical Action
4. Close front gate, close hind gate. Tie the horse at this time if warranted.
Rationale/Amplification

Haltering and Leading
Purpose
 To provide fundamental restraint for horse
Complications
· Injury to handler if stepped on by the horse
Equipment
●Halter
Lead rope
PROCEDURE
Haltering the Horse
Technical Action
1. Approach horse slowly from the left side in the area of the shoulder.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. The shoulder is the safest area of the horse.
1b. If the horse is not aware of your presence, make a soft sound that will alert him.
1c. Never approach a horse directly from behind.
1d. Most horses are accustomed to being handled from the left side.
Technical Action
2. Place lead rope around neck.
Restraint of the Horse  Chapter 7
107
Rationale/Amplification
2a. The lead rope should be as close to the head as possible, not low on the neck.
2b. The lead rope should be attached to the ventral D-ring of the halter.
Technical Action
 3. Place nose band over horse's nose and buckle strap
behind ears.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. Some halters have a ventral clasp that is buckled
 instead of the crown piece, which goes behind the ears.
 3b. Try to minimize contact with the ears, because many
horses are sensitive about their ears being touched.
3c. See Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3: Haltering the horse.
PROCEDURE
Leading the Horse
Technical Action
1. The horse should be haltered with the lead rope
attached.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. See Figure 7-4.
Figure 7-4: Leading the horse.
108
 Unit 2 Large Animal Restraint 
Technical Action
2. Stand on the left side of the horse.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. The left side is also referred to as the near side; the right side is called the off side.
Technical Action
3. Hold lead rope in right hand 12 inches from the halter. Coil the excess rope and place in left hand.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. Never wrap any portion of a lead rope around yourself.
3b. If needed, the handler can always grasp the cheek piece or chin strap of the halter.
Technical Action
4. Walk forward at a brisk pace.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. Do not look at the horse. He knows that he should be following you.
Technical Action
5. Should the horse become unruly, circle to the left. This will allow you to act as a pivot while the horse
circles around you.
Applying Chains
Purpose
· Increase the amount of restraint through increased pressure
Complications
·Head tossing
●Tissue trauma (buccal or oral)
Restraint of the Horse Chapter 7
109
Equipment
Halter
· Lead rope with shank chain
PROCEDURE
Applying Chains
Technical Action
1. Halter the horse.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. Chains can be used over the nose, under the chin, in the mouth, or under the lip, if necessary. All of the
methods increase the amount of restraint, with varying degrees of discomfort.
1b. Horses should never be tied using a chain lead rope, because it could result in severe trauma if the horse
were to pull back.
Technical Action
2. Chain over nose:
 Disconnect chain from ventral halter D-ring, and pass
chain through left side ring, over nose, and attach to
right side ring.
Rationale/Amplification
 2a. If the chain is long enough, it can be passed through
the right-side D-ring and clipped to the ventral ring.
or it can be passed through the right-side D-ring and
clasped to the right-cheek D-ring.
2b. Looping the chain one time around the halter's nose
band will help prevent the chain from slipping down the
nose. See Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5: Chain over the nose.
110
Unit 2  Large Animal Restraint
Technical Action
3. Chain under chin:
Pass chain through left side D-ring under chin and
attach to right side D-ring.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. See Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-6: Chain under the chin.
Technical Action
4. Chain in mouth:
a. Pass chain through left side D-ring under chin and
attach to right side D-ring.
Loosen chain such that there is enough slack to reach
horse's lips.
b. Place right arm ventral to head and grasp head in the
 area of nose band with right hand.
c. Insert left thumb in commissure of the lips. As horse
opens mouth, slide chain in (as if placing a bit in
mouth).
d. Apply slight pressure to chain to remove slack.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. The chain should rest comfortably, just touching the
 commissure on the lips. If the chain is too tight or too
low in the mouth, it will cause unnecessary discomfort.
4b. Placing a chain in the mouth is rarely done in
veterinary practice. Care should be taken to prevent
harm to the delicate tissues of the lips.
Figure 7-7: Chain in the mouth.
4c. See Figure 7-7.
Restraint of the Horse Chapter 7
111
Technical Action
5. Chain under lip:
a. See steps 4a and 4b above.
b. Lift upper lip and slide chain over gum under the lip.
c. Apply slight pressure to remove slack.
Rationale/Amplification
5a. This can be extremely painful when pressure is applied. Do not maintain pressure when the horse is
cooperative. The chain should rest snugly without causing any discomfort.
Twitches
Purpose
●Application of pressure with the intent to distract attention or induce
 endorphin release
Complications
· Personnel injury
●Trauma to lip
Equipment
●Halter
· Lead rope
•Twitch
PROCEDURE
Hand Twitching
Technical Action
1. Apply halter and lead rope.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. Never attempt to apply a twitch without haltering the horse.
1b. Twitches provide minor pain for the horse, thereby creating a distraction during a clinical procedure.
1c. If applied to the nose, twitches are thought to cause endorphin release, thereby suppressing pain in the horse.
112
Unit 2  Large Animal Restraint
Technical Action
2. Turn head toward you and grasp the loose skin in
the neck area just cranial to the shoulder. Grasp a large
amount of skin, twist slightly, and hold firmly.
Rationale/Amplification
 2a. Hand twitching is performed most commonly in the
neck area. A twitch should never be applied to a horse's
ear. Holding onto the nose manually is difficult and
better accomplished using a mechanical twitch.
2b. Turning the head toward you loosens the skin,

making it easier to grasp.
the neck.
2c. See Figure 7-8
PROCEDURE
Applying Mechanical Twitches
Technical Action
1. Apply halter and lead rope.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. Never attempt to apply a twitch without haltering the horse.
1b. Twitches provide minor pain for the horse, thereby creating a distraction during a clinical procedure.
1c. If applied to the nose, twitches are thought to cause endorphin release, thereby suppressing pain in the horse.
Technical Action
2. Select twitch type.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. Mechanical twitches include the Kendal humane twitch, chain twitch, or rope twitch.
2b. The Kendal humane twitch is hinged, which prevents over tightening. It can also be made self-retaining.
Restraint of the Horse  Chapter 7
113
Technical Action
3. Place hand through twitch and firmly grasp
upper lip.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. The horse will most likely resist by raising or
flipping its head up and down.
 3b. Grasp as much of the upper lip as possible.
3c. See Figure 7-9.
Figure 7-9: Applying a mechanical twitch.
Technical Action
4. Secure rope and chain twitches by rapidly twisting wooden handle.
a. The humane twitch is secured by pressing arms together (like a nutcracker), then winding the
attached string around bottom of arms and clipping to side or ventral D-ring of halter.
Rationale/Amplification
4a. To keep twitch in place, the handler must not pull it downward. Think of pushing the twitch into
the nose.
4b. The most common reason for twitches coming off at inappropriate times is that the handler
 pulls down.
4c. If a self-retaining twitch is not needed, the humane twitch does not need to be clipped
to the halter.
Technical Action
5. To remove twitch, untwist and then rub horse's nose with the palm of your hand to stimulate
circulation.
Rationale/Amplification
 5a. Twitches should not remain in place more than 20 minutes without loosening temporarily to facilitate
circulation.

Special Handling Scenarios
Foals
Foals are very delicate and often lack the handling experience of older animals. The
handler should take care to assess the individual foal's temperament and degree of
training. Make every attempt to keep the mare and foal within sight of each other.
In general, the closer the mare is to the foal the better the result of the procedure.
Leading Foals
Technique is dependent upon the amount of prior training.
·If the foal is not halter broken, the best method is to cradle the foal in your
arms and push it up against the mare's side.
116
Unit 2  Large Animal Restraint
·If the foal has some experience with the halter, a rump rope can be used.
Attach lead rope to the ventral halter D-ring. Use this lead rope as the standard
lead rope, then place a second lead rope around foal's rump and back through
the halter. Apply more pressure to the butt rope than to the halter lead rope
(approximately 70-to-30 percent of pressure). See Figure 7-11.
●If the foal is halter broken, use the techniques described for adult horses.
Figure 7-11: Application of a
rump rope to a foal.
PROCEDURE
Cradling Foals
Technical Action
1. Place one arm around foal's chest and the other
around the rump. Cradle foal in arms.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. Some foals will slump in the handler's arms. If this
happens, loosen hold and foal will begin bearing its own
weight.
1b. See Figure 7-12.

2a. Mare should also be very calm.
Technical Action
3. With exuberant foals, the handler can grasp the base of the tail
Rationale/Amplification
3a. Do not pull tail upward or the foal will attempt to sit down.
Stallions
Although most stallions are well behaved, they are much more exuberant and volatile
than geldings and mares. In general, they are more likely to strike, bite, or rear.
Knowing this, special care should be taken to maintain adequate physical distance
between stallions and other horses. A minimum of 20 feet should be maintained
stallion must be in the presence of mares in heat (estrus). Novice horseman would
be advised to avoid handling stallions until they are very competent handling mares
 and geldings.

Restraint of Cattle
Cattle exhibit marked variance in their response to handling. Dairy cows or 4-H
animals accustomed to intimate daily contact tolerate restraint more readily than
range cattle. The selection of restraining facilities and equipment directly reflects
this variance. Wise handlers will always assess breed, sex, and production use prior
to unloading any cattle.
Guidelines for Restraint of Cattle
Cattle are not typically haltered or led. They are pushed or driven via arm
waving and similar measures. Handlers must remember to avoid standing where
they want the cattle to go. For example, do not stand in front of the chute if
you want the cow to exit the chute through the front or head gate. Care should
be taken not to overly agitate the cattle when driving them.
· Cattle are very herd oriented. Hence, they are much easier to manipulate as a
group than as individuals.
· The fight-flight distance for cattle is approximately 15-20 feet, although this
can vary dramatically from breed to breed.
 Always inspect facilities prior to processing. Familiarize yourself with the
chute, and ensure that fences are sturdy and gates are locked. Loose cattle are
extremely difficult to catch.
+(
 Cattle breeds vary dramatically with regard to temperament. In general, dairy
breeds are much more docile than beef breeds. (This statement is true for cows.
not bulls.)
· Caution should always be exercised when working with bulls. This is especially
relevant when working with dairy bulls.
●Avoid the use of dogs unless the dog is extremely well trained.
● Although most cattle are not overtly aggressive, the following actions can cause
damage to personnel.
1. Butting: Cattle will swing their heads and use them as battering rams. This
is especially dangerous in horned animals.
 2. Kicking: The cow kick is usually forward and to the side. Restrained cattle
are less likely to kick caudally although this can happen. Cattle almost
never kick with both hind limbs simultaneously.
3. Trampling: Cattle will often run directly over individuals who are blocking
their path of escape.
4. Biting: Cows rarely. if ever, bite.
 Dramatic advances have been made in recent years regarding humane handling
and processing of cattle. Many individuals have contributed to the welfare of cattle
and revolutionized our understanding of bovine restraint. Review of such material is
advised.
Processing Facilities
Cattle typically are processed using facilities that have the following equipment. See
Figure 8-1.
 Chute: This piece of equipment provides immobilization via a head catch and
squeezable sides. The side panels can be dropped to examine feet and legs.
while the side bars can be dropped to examine the dorsum of the animal.
Restraint of CattleChapter 8
121
Head plates with halters can be attached to the head catch to facilitate
dehorning. Many models and brands are available. Technicians and veterinar-
ians should familiarize themselves with individual chute operation prior to 
use. See Figure 8-1a.
●Stock: A stock is similar to a chute but does not possess squeezable sides. It is
 not meant for processing large numbers of cattle and should never be used with
fractious animals.
·Alley way: The alley way is the narrow passage area that prevents cattle from
turning around as they approach the chute. Poles or back gates can be used to
prevent cattle from backing up in the alley way as they approach the chute.
See Figure 8-1b.
Figure 8-1a: Cow in a squeeze
chute.
Figure 8-1b: Alley way.
122
Unit 2 Large Animal Restraint
Figure 8-1c: Sweep tub.
Sweep tub: Sweep tubs permit a small group of cattle to be squeezed together
to facilitate passage in the alley way. Minimizing excess room space decreases
the opportunity for cattle to turn around and refuse to enter the alley way.
See Figure 8-1c.
Palpation cage: These gates are placed directly behind the chute. They facilitate
entrance into the tailgate of the chute by prohibiting cattle in the alley way
from approaching the chute. See Figure 8-1d.

·Provide the most effective method of restraint for cattle
Complications
· Injury to cattle
·Injury to personnel
Equipment
·Chute
PROCEDURE
Operating Chutes
Technical Action 
1. Ready chute for operation by opening head catch, releasing squeeze, and opening tailgate.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. Familiarize yourself with the individual chute operation before running cattle. There are many models
 available, each with slight variations in operation.
Technical Action
2. Allow cow to enter.
Technical Action
3. Catch head.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. Experienced chute operators will often close the tailgate before catching the head. This prevents the
cow from backing out of the chute before her head is caught. Slow operators will miss cattle using this
technique.
124
Unit 2  Large Animal Restraint
Technical Action 
4. Close tailgate.
Technical Action
 5. Apply squeeze.
Rationale/Amplification
5a. Chutes can accommodate various sizes of animals by manually moving the side panels inward or outward.
If the cow can't be squeezed sufficiently, check the position of the side panel. If needed, move the panel
inward by adjusting the pins located on the ventral corners.
Technical Action
6. To release cow, release squeeze and then release head catch.
Rationale/Amplification
6a. If a dehorning plate is attached, the cow will need to be released from the side of the chute, instead of
through the head catch.
Haltering
Purpose
 Provide restraint of head
·Permit leading of cattle that have been halter broken
Complication
Trauma to personnel
Equipment
 Cow halter
PROCEDURE
Haltering Cattle
Technical Action
1. Place cow in chute or stock.
Restraint of Cattle Chapter 8
125
Rationale/Amplification
1a. If cow has been broken to a halter, it can be applied in the stall or pen.
Technical Action
2. Place crown piece of halter over ears, then slip nose
through nosepiece. Adjust halter such that nose band
crosses over bridge of nose halfway between the nostrils
 and eyes.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. Cattle halters typically are made of a single piece
of rope that forms both the halter and lead rope. The
halter is adjustable and should be fitted individually to
each cow.
2b. The adjustable portion of the nose band should

PROCEDURE
Tailing-up Cattle
Technical Action
1. Place cow in chute or stock and catch head.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. See Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-3: Tailing-up a cow.
Technical Action
2. Stand caudal to cow and use both hands to grasp the base of the tail, 5-6 inches from the anus. Push the
tail straight over the dorsum. Do not permit tail to curl or to shift left to right.
Rationale/Amplification
 2a. Movement or deviation of the tail dramatically decreases the effectiveness of tailing-up. A cow is very
likely to kick if inappropriate technique is used.
 2b. This technique should not be confused with tail twisting, which involves bending the tail to make a cow
move forward.
2c. Grasping the tail base decreases the likelihood of damaging coccygeal vertebrae.
Technical Action
3. Maintain pressure until directed to release.
Rationale/Amplification
3a. This hold can result in arm fatigue.

Unit 2  Large Animal Restraint
Technical Action
5. Run rope medial to forelimbs, crisscross over back,
then run medial to hind limbs.
Rationale/Amplification
5a. See Figure 8-4.
 5b. The Burley method of casting is superior to the
half-hitch method in that it does not place pressure on
the trachea, penis, or mammary veins. The rope ends 
can also be used to tie the hind limbs in a flexed
position, thus eliminating the need for an assistant

PROCEDURE
Placing a Nose Ring
Technical Action
1. Place bull in chute.
Rational/Amplification
1a. Proper restraint is critical for attaining correct placement.
Technical Action
2. Place halter or secure head in head plate.
Rational/Amplification
 2a. Head plates are much preferred over halters, because they immobilize the head better.
Technical Action
3. Select ring of the appropriate size.
Rational/Amplification
3a. Rings typically are placed when bulls are 1-2 years of age. Do not use large rings on these small bulls,
because they will enlarge the nasal septum hole inappropriately.
3b. Ring sizes are small: 2.5 inches, medium: 3 inches, and large: 3.5 inches.
3c. Rings that are too large or placed too close to the end of the septum will hang out and catch on objects.
A torn nasal septum can be catastrophic to a bull's breeding career.

Restraint of the Goat
Goats are unique in their dual role as both production and pet animals. Discerning
individual animal status is best accomplished through consultation and observa-
tion of the animal with the owner. Goats fulfiling pet roles should be referred to by
 name. Interactions with this category of goat should parallel relationships to pets
such as dogs. Alternatively, interactions with production goats will mirror interac-
tions with cattle.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Goat
 Goats are gregarious, fun-loving animals that do not possess a strong herd
instinct. They typically respond well to gentle handling and willingly accom-
 pany handlers away from the herd. Goats are not typically haltered but are led
using a collar around the neck.
● Distraught or angry goats will vocalize and stamp their forefeet. Although they
do not usually charge. extremely stressed goats may attempt to jump over a
handler. This typically results in the feet of the goat being placed in the center
of the handler's chest as the animal attempts to spring over.
 Horned goats may attempt to butt the handler. Goats do not bite or kick.
 Scent glands contribute to the unpleasant odor of intact males. This foul smell
is especially noticeable during breeding season. Bucks will also urinate on their
beards and forelimbs to increase their attractiveness to the does. Wise handlers
do not stand unaware in front of bucks during the breeding season.

· Collar
·Lead rope
PROCEDURE
Collaring and Leading Goats
Technical Action
1. Place collar on neck, leaving 2 inches of space between collar and neck.
140
Unit 2 Large Animal Restraint
Rationale/Amplification
1a. Most goats receiving veterinary care are considered companion animals. As such, they are typically handled
in a manner consistent with that of other large animals of companion status (e.g., horse, lama). They are not
handled in the same way as are production animals (e.g., cow, pig). This distinction is very important to goat
owners.
Technical Action 
2. Attach lead rope and lead animal from left side.
Rationale/Amplification
2a. Most goats are accustomed to handling and will follow readily.
2b. If a lead rope is not available, it is acceptable to grasp the collar directly.

 Collar
PROCEDURE
Placing Goat in Stanchion
Technical Action
1. Lead goat to stanchion using collar.
Rationale/Amplification
1a. A stanchion is essentially a raised platform with a head catch. It is not suitable for fractious animals.
Restraint of the Goat Chapter 9
141
Technical Action
 2. Encourage goat to jump onto platform by clucking
 and lifting up on collar. Secure head in head catch.
Rationale/Amplification
 2a. Many stanchions have attached grain boxes. Placing
 a handful of grain in the box rewards the goat for good
behavior.
2b. Milk goats readily accept stanchions; however,
production and pet goats may require encouragement.
See Figure 9-1a.
Figure 9-1a: Goat secured in stanchion.
2c. If a stanchion is unavailable, the animal can
be straddled or held by the collar. See Figures 9-1b
and 9-1c.

Restraint of Pigs
Intelligent and independent animals such as pigs do not appreciate restraint, and
they never hesitate to voice their displeasure when subjected to this insult. Use of
appropriate processing facilities can help to minimize this disruption; however, many
 pig owners do not have these facilities available.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Pig
· Pigs are independent animals with little herd instinct. Although they do not seek
comfort from a herd, pigs show great concern when fellow pigs are distressed.
Thus, handlers should take care when working within a confined group.
 Most pigs are not aggressive. When stressed, however, pigs can inflict extensive
gated canine teeth (tusks).
 Sows with litters are very protective. Care should be taken to confine the sow
when handling the piglets.
Pig Boards
Purpose
● General restraint for examination or moving pigs from one area to another
Complications
·Pig escapes under board
·Handler knocked over
Equipment
●Pig board (3-foot by 4-foot piece of plywood with hand holds)

Restraint of the Llama
A gradual rise in llama popularity has brought these animals out of the exotic desig-
nation into a routine large animal arena. Technicians working in mixed or large ani-
mal practices will most likely encounter llamas with some frequency. Unique in their
own right, llamas are restrained using techniques common to both horses and cattle.
For example, llamas are haltered routinely and led, yet they are also restrained with
head catches. Ultimately, familiarity with handling will be the most influential fac-
tor in determining the restraint techniques used on each animal.
Guidelines for Restraint of the Llama
 Llamas are social and curious animals. They vary dramatically in their response
to restraint, and this is most likely the result of prior handling experiences.
Some llamas are extremely well trained, while others may never have been
touched. Therefore, it is advisable to talk with the owner to determine proper
restraint protocol.
 Although most llamas are very docile, they can cause harm in a number of
ways. These include biting (especially dangerous in intact males with canine
teeth). spitting. regurgitation, and kicking. Most llamas will kick like a cow
does, but occasionally they will kick directly behind with one foot.
