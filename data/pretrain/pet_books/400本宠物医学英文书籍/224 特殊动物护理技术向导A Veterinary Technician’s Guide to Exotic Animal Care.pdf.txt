INTRODUCTION
There are close to 9,000 different avian species worldwide. These are not
different breeds of the same species, like dogs and cats, but are, in fact,
entirely different animals within the class Aves. Upon first learning of this
difference, it would seem impossible to become qualified to treat so many
different types of birds. With this in mind, a technician must learn and
become knowledgeable about basic avian husbandry, diagnostic sampling.
and patient care. Most veterinary practices see only companion avian spe-
cies (e.g. parrots, macaws, and cockatiels) and caged birds (e.g., finches and
canaries). These are the species that technicians need to become familiar with
and comfortable handling and treating. Through experience and modifica-
tion of technical skills, the transition between avian species is easy to make,
if needed, for wildlife or zoological avian species (e.g., toucans, famingos,
penguins, and ostriches). Companion avian species need to be examined
yearly, groomed regularly, and vaccinated on a regular schedule. As with
other exotic species, the presentation of the patient in the exam room allows
the technician to provide husbandry and nutritional information to the cli-
ent. Captive-reared companion avian species are excellent pets, with each
species having advantages and disadvantages to ownership—similar to the
physical and personality differences observed in cat and dog breeds. If placed
 on a proper diet and maintained on that nutritional regimen, most pet birds
live long, healthy lives

Of course, if an owner has another species of bird
(e.g., pigeons, peafowl, waterfowl, and ratites), the
commercially available feed is recommended.
For companion avian species, which include
parrots, macaws, and caged songbirds, advances
in nutrition have been made in the form of pellets
(Figure 1.6). These pelleted bird diets are manu-
factured by a number of companies and come
in many shapes, sizes, and favors. The secret to

allow the bird to see other birds eating the pel-
lets. There are also commercially manufactured
seed cakes and seed balls that will aid the transi-
tion from loose seed to pellets (Figures 1.7 and
AVI-CAKES'-
AVI-CAKE
1.8). It is much easier to convert a group of birds
from a seed diet to a pelleted diet than a single
bird. Single cockatiels, one of the most popular
pet birds, might be the most difficult bird to
transition to a pelleted diet. A bird that is being
transitioned to a pelleted diet should be weighed
every two to three days. If there is a consistent
weight loss, the seed diet should be resumed and
another method used for pellet acceptance. Some
birds will not accept a pellet diet, but this is rare.
Figure 1.7 Many companies offer trial sizes tbat can
be provided to avian clients.
If the pellets are colored, some birds will eat only
specifc colors, which can change the color of the
fecal material and promote food waste. This does
not cause any health problems, but does assure
the owner that the bird is eating the pellets and
not just crushing them in its beak.
Although some feed manufacturers promote
pelleted diets as containing all of the required
nutrients for a complete diet, a diversifed diet
with pellets as the foundation is recommended.
This diversified diet should contain seeds, vegeta-
bles, possibly cheese and cooked eggs, and a small 
amount of fruit (Figure 1.9). Some pet bird species
that have fruit as a large part of their diet (e.g.
Figure 1.8 Compacted seed treats often belp birds

Bird owners are constantly seeking quality health
care for their birds. This health care includes pro-
fessional grooming services. For many veterinary
 practices, this is understood for dogs and to a lesser
extent cats, but not for avian species. One of the
most common companion bird presentations to
veterinary clinics is for grooming services. Groom-
 ing birds includes beak, feather, and nail trims.

from trauma, parasites, or developmental abnor-

Nail trimming is usually done upon owner

 good health maintenance. Bird nails can become
very sharp, enabling a bird to hold on to the
perch. Some birds, such as cockatoo species, have

ing entangled in the cage bars (Figure 1.15). The
nails should be bluntly trimmed to the level of the
plantar surface of the foot with a motor-driven
hobby tool (Figures 1.16 and 1.17). If bleeding
continues after the trim, silver nitrate-tipped
wooden applicator sticks are recommended for
hemostasis. Young birds' nails have a tendency to
bleed more often than older birds' nails. The nails
should be trimmed when the bird is hurting the
owner or when there is excessive overgrowth. For
small birds (e.g., <150 grams) electrocautery units
can be used to reduce the length while providing
hemostasis (Figure 1.18).

When an avian patient, or any exotic animal
 patient, is so ill that capture and restraint might 
cause death, the owner needs to be fully informed
 of the possible consequences. To reduce stress on
small birds during capture, the overhead light
should be turned off after the technician has estab-
lished the location of the bird. In the dark, birds
 do not often move or see the hand prior to cap-
ture. The lighting of the room should be returned
to normal once the patient is in the technician's
hands. This method of capture works extremely
well when a bird is free-fying in the room or with
large, diffcult-to-catch parrots. Small birds (<120
 grams) can be held in one hand. The head is main-
tained between the forefnger and middle finger,

should be held in an Elizabethan grip around the
neck, with the thumb and forefinger touching and
pressing up against the mandible, the other hand
holding the feet. With the bird's head and feet
restrained, the bird is held against the handler's
body, thereby restricting one wing., while the
other wing is held in place by the index and little
finger of the hand holding the head. A towel can
 also be used to restrict the wings while restraining
the avian patient (Figure 1.22). The Elizabethan

Once the patient has been captured with a
towel (or in the case of breeder birds, with a net
or gloves), it can be placed in an avian restraint
device for examination or diagnostic testing (e.g.
radiographs; Figure 1.23). This Plexiglas board
can restrain birds from the size of a budgerigar to
a hyacinth macaw. Typically, birds that are placed
in the device are less stressed than ones held by
veterinary technicians. The veterinary technician

There are many different species of birds that
might present to a veterinary clinic, each of which
provides diffrent obstacles and dangers to the per-
 son trying to capture the patient. If you are not
sure how to capture and restrain an animal, please
 ask someone who knows the proper technique.
This will help protect you and the patient from
serious injury. Owls, eagles, and hawks have pow-

wounds. Raptors need to be captured using leather

sharp beaks, which they routinely thrust toward the
eyes of someone they perceive as a threat to their
well-being (Figure 1.24). These birds should be cap-
tured and restrained by someone who is wearing
protective eyewear. Again, if you are not sure how
to capture and restrain an avian patient, please ask
an experienced veterinary technician or veterinarian.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The first and most important information the
veterinarian will obtain about the avian patient is

be weighed on a digital gram scale that measures
in l-gram increments. Tame birds can be placed
on a perch that is attached to the base of the
scale with Velcro strips. Untamed birds can be
weighed in a container or in the restraint device
(Figure 1.25).
Once the bird has been examined prior to cap-
ture and it has been determined that the patient
is in a condition to be restrained, the veterinarian
will perform a hands-on physical examination.
The feather quality is the first feature that is
examined on the bird. Feathers are examined for
abnormal molting, development, damage, abnor-

and should also be free of abscesses or epithelial

which makes it diffcult to determine hydration
status in these species. Hydration status in avian
species should be determined by assessing cor-

moisture, and packed cell volume.
The crop, or ingluvies, is positioned at the level
of the thoracic inlet. Crop stasis, or a large doughy
feel to the crop because of undigested food, is
often a sign of bacterial ingluvitis. Foreign bodies
or trauma associated with hand-feeding might be
noted as bruising in this area or by confirmation
of a presentation history provided by the owner. If
the owner feeds food that is too hot, bruising can
occur; or if presentation of the patient is delayed

this gland is abnormal.
Most birds project their waste from the body;
therefore, the feathers around the vent are nor-
mally clean. Any soiling or pasting of waste noted
around the vent should be considered abnormal.
The vent and cloaca are examined for papillomas
(cloacal warts), especially in larger parrots and
 macaws. A cotton-tipped applicator can be placed
in the cloaca, carefully everting the structure to
observe the mucocutaneous junction. The normal

the solution on the questionable surface, one can
obtain a tentative diagnosis. If the mucous surface
of the cloaca is intact, the vinegar will not adhere
but if the surface is compromised by papillomas,
the surface will turn white.
Birds' lungs are located on the ventral aspect
of the thoracic vertebrae. By locating the head of
the stethoscope on the dorsal body wall in this
area, one may listen for any abnormal respira-

Dystocia, or egg-binding, is the inability of a hen
to complete the process of laying an egg. The egg

 Proper identification of a reptile or amphibian is essential to case manage-

suggestions regarding the environmental and nutritional needs of that ani-

As noted, little is known about the specific dietary
requirements of reptiles and amphibians. In the
past, many of the nutritional problems diagnosed
in reptiles and amphibians were associated with
vitamin and mineral deficiencies and the need for
supplements was apparent. More recently, diseases
associated with excessive vitamin and mineral

arisen regarding how much of these supplements

LIZARDS
For small specimens, place your thumb and
index finger on either side of the ramus (man-

palm of your hand. Never constrict the animal's
body when you are restraining it, because reptiles,
except crocodilians, lack a diaphragm and you
can suffocate them. For larger specimens, again
place your index finger and thumb on the cor-

Crocodilians should be restrained only by experi-
enced professionals. Getting control of the mouth
is important when restraining a crocodilian. The
 muscles used to close a crocodilian's jaws are very
powerful, whereas the muscles used to open the
jaws are not as powerful. Therefore, once the
mouth of a crocodilian is closed it can be held
securely with minimal effort. When restraining a
crocodilian, frst grasp the head at the base of the

AMPHIBIANS
Amphibians have a very delicate and sensitive
integument. The epidermis is covered by a protec-

protects these animals against pathogens. There

(complete blood count), plasma enzymes, and
electrolytes. The volume of blood that can be
safely collected from a reptile is 0.5%-0.8% of its
body weight or 0.5-0.8 ml/100 g body weight.
It is important to consider the animal's history
and physical examination when determining the
volume of blood that can be collected. An ani-
 mal that has experienced an acute blood loss (e.g-.
trauma) cannot afford to have large volumes of
blood collected. Fortunately, most laboratories
can perform a complete blood count (CBC) and a
plasma chemistry analysis on <l ml of blood.

Blood samples should be placed in appropri-
ate collection tubes immediately after collction.
Microtainers (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
NJ) are useful for this purpose, because they use
dry anticoagulants, which are less likely to dilute

preference for type of collection tubes, so it is
important to contact them prior to submitting

Cardiocentesis should be used with caution in
amphibians. There are some reports of animals
dying after having blood collected from their
heart. Some veterinarians have had good experi-
ence using cardiocentesis in amphibians; however,
a rare death has been known to be associated with
the procedure. The heart of most amphibians is
located within the pectoral girdle; therefore, the
needle should be directed medially through the
axillary region to collect the sample (Figure 2.18).
A 25- to 27-gauge needle should be used to collect
the sample. No more than one to two attempts

INTRODUCTION
The ferret, Mustela putorius furo, belongs to the order Carnivora and the
family Mustelidae. These animals initially became popular as pets in the
United States during the 1970s. Over the next two decades their numbers
increased signifcantly, with estimates of more than 7 million ferrets being
kept as pets in 1990.' More recent surveys conducted by the American Vet-
erinary Medical Association suggest that their popularity has continued to
rise into the new century, with a 6.5% increase in pet ferret numbers being
reported between 2001 and 2007 (http://www.avma.org/reference/market
stats/ownership.asp). The ferret has endeared itself to humans because of

popular in urban domiciles (e.g. apartments) that might be too small to
house dogs or cats.
Domestication of the ferret is not recent; it has been recorded that ferrets
were used for hunting more than 2,000 years ago.2 The ferret was originally
introduced into the United States more than 300 years ago. In other parts of
the world, such as England, the ferret serves in a working role as a hunter of
rabbits and rodents. Male ferrets are called hobs, females, jills, and their young.
kits. Sexing ferrets is straightforward; males have a prepuce on their ventral
abdomen, similar to dogs, and females have a vulva ventral to their anus. The
ferret is also used extensively in research.

an unfortunate reputation in certain areas as dangerous around children or a
threat to native wildlife. In California, a 1933 law regulating the importation
of mustelids is responsible for the current prohibition on pet ferrets in Cali-

ferrets as pets, so it is important to research the laws in your state and local

Ferrets are true carnivores and have a relatively
short gastrointestinal tract, which makes them
capable of procesing a meal within 3-4 hours.
This is important to consider when performing a
 gastrointestinal radiographic contrast series.

Environmental Concerns
Ferrets may be maintained indoors or outdoors.
They are primarily maintained indoors in the
United States, whereas they are often maintained
outdoors in Europe. Ferrets kept outdoors should be
protected from extremes of heat and cold. During
the summer months, animals should be provided
shelter and fresh water and should be removed from
direct sun. Ferrets do not tolerate temperatures
over 88"-90°F. In the winter, animals should be
provided a shelter with straw or hay. When the tem-
perature drops below freezing (32°F), ferrets should
be brought into a warm shelter.
Ferrets should be given a well-ventilated, spa-
cious enclosure. Glass fish tanks are not suitable
for ferrets because they do not allow for ade-

The animal's eyes should be clear and free of

formed on any animal in which a corneal ulcer is
suspected. In some cases the corneal ulcer will be
readily apparent because of gross changes to the
corneal surface, whereas in other cases it might be
more subtle and present in the form of increased
blinking or just holding an eye closed because it is

responsive to opioids (e.g., butorphanol, 0.05-0.3

Ferrets should be fasted for a minimum of 4
hours prior to an anesthetic procedure, although
special precautions should be taken (e.g., IV dex-
trose) for an animal susceptible to a hypoglycemic
episode (e.g., ferret with insulinoma). A water
source can be left with the ferret up to the time

For short procedures, such as venipuncture or
radiography, inhalant anesthetics can be used to
facilitate sample collection. Ferrets can be “masked
down" using an appropriately sized mask, or placed
into an induction chamber and anesthetized (Fig-
ure 3.10). Inducing anesthesia via face mask at 5%
isofurane or 8% sevoflurane expedites the process
of getting the animal through the sedation phase,
which is the time they struggle. Once the ferret
has lost its righting refex, it can be maintained at
1%-2% isofurane or 2%-3% sevofurane. Anes-

INTRODUCTION
 One of the most common misconceptions regarding rabbits is that they
belong to the order Rodentia, which includes mice, rats, and guinea pigs.
Rabbits belong to the order of animals called Lagomorpha, which also
includes hares and pikas. Rabbits differ from mice, rats, and guinea pigs
behind the primary incisors, which rodents do not have. This classifica-
tion difference is important to point out in the beginning of this chapter,
because rabbit husbandry and health concerns are very different from those
of rodents. Many rabbits are obtained through impulse purchases during the
spring and Easter season. Often these impulse purchases do not include edu-
cation on proper husbandry, nutrition, or health maintenance. It is hoped
that new rabbit owners will schedule an appointment with a veterinarian
for a routine health examination and, most importantly, receive an educa-
tion during the visit on the requirements for maintaining a healthy, happy
pet. Frequently, an owner will ask c
questions regarding the basic physiologic
values of their new pet rabbit. It is important for the technician to know the
normal physiologic values not only to answer owners’ questions, but also
to assess the patients' health status upon presentation to the clinic and to
administer medical therapy (Table 4.1)
Anatomy and Physiology
The technician needs to become familiar with a few areas of rabbit-specific
anatomy. It might seem that rabbits are very docile animals. Although rab-
bits can be very gentle, they are territorial and will mark and viciously defend
their territory. The chin glands, anal glands, and inguinal glands are used to
mark territory and young. Males mark most often, followed by dominants
of both sexes over subordinates. The scrotal sacs are cranial and lateral to

nail trimmers can be used on rabbit claws. In
many rabbit patients the vascular “quick" can be
observed through the clear claw. With the rabbit
well restrained the claw is clipped below the level
of the blood line. If the claw is cut too close and
bleeding occurs, a silver nitrate hemostatic stick
can be used to apply the chemical cautery agent.
 Plastic nail caps that are applied with tissue glue
can also be used to prevent owner injury caused
by sharp claws. Rabbits should never be declawed
because they have a different foot anatomy than a
cat. If a rabbit is declawed, permanent foot injury
will result from which most will not recover.

THERAPEUTICS
Often rabbit patients do not present in a condition
that would initially seem critical. After a thorough
history and physical examination, the veterinar-
ian might decide that the patient is in distress
and the technician must be prepared to provide
the necessary critical care. If injections need to be
administered, subcutaneous sites of choice include
the dorsal cervical region and lateral fank area;
the intramuscular sites are the epaxial muscles that

Antibiotic solutions can be used to treat infections
involving the nasolacrimal duct, and radiopaque

cases where this is not evident.
Fluid Therapy
For rabbit patients the cephalic or lateral saphe-
nous veins are recommended for indwelling
catheter placement when providing fuid ther-

SURGICAL AND ANESTHETIC
ASSISTANCE
 Once the decision has been made to perform a sur-
gical procedure, certain equipment requirements
 must be met for proper surgical preparation. To
aid in the intubation process, a short narrow laryn-
 goscope and a rigid plastic catheter are needed. All
 other surgical equipment is similar to that used for
small kittens and dogs. Medical skin staples allow
for rapid closure in the thin elastic skin, and most
rabbit patients are unable to remove them.
Preparation of the patient prior to surgery

6. Minimize the duration of surgery and anesthesia.
In addition, the skin is thin, elastic, and easily
traumatized. The clipper blade should be held fat,
close to the skin, and the fur clipped at a slow, cau-
tious speed. Regular cleaning of the clipper blade
during the preparation will improve the ability of
the blade to cut the fine fur.
The surgical site should be prepped after clip-
ping to reduce the heat loss in these small animals.
General recommendations to reduce heat loss are
listed in Table 4.6.14
When anesthetizing a rabbit, the biggest dif-
ficulty facing the technician is the intubation
process. The mouth does not open widely, the
distal portion of the tongue is muscular, the lar-
ynx is in the caudal oropharynx, and rabbits are
predisposed to having laryngospasms.4 Various
methods of intubation can be used, other than
the oral route, including nasotracheal and a blind
technique, using an endotracheal tube attached

Rodents
Guinea Pigs,
Hamsters, Gerbils
Rats, and Mice
Information on the guinea pig and small pet rodent (hamsters, gerbils, rats,
and mice) has been compiled into one chapter. Because there are many
similarities in care, husbandry, diagnostic testing, and treatment for these
animals, some information is true for all rodents, in which case it is described
in just one area of the text, and readers are referred to that specific section.
When information is unique to a specific species, that information is covered
separately.
INTRODUCTION
GUINEA PIGS
Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) are native to the Andean highlands of north-
central and northwestern South America.' Three main breeds are maintained
as companion animals: (l) the English, or common, which is characterized
by short, straight, fine hair; (2) the Abyssinian, with rough, wiry hair in
rosettes or whorls; and (3) the Peruvian, with long, straight, silky hair (Fig-
ures 5.1A and 5.1B). Of all rodent species, guinea pigs might be the best
choice for pets. They are usually nonaggressive, rarely bite, enjoy being held,
and are long-lived in comparison with many other rodents.

should be fresh and supplemented with ascorbic

for guinea pigs, it is very important to ask about
vitamin C supplementation and the age of the
animal's food. Vitamin C will degrade over time
 and when exposed to extreme heat. Recently pur-

to have maintained the nutritious value of that
vitamin.

respiratory compromise could occur. To prevent
respiratory distress, the handler should place the
hand around the neck from the ventral aspect of
the animal, while supporting the rear legs with
the other hand.
HAMSTERS
Hamsters and other small rodents can be restrained
by pinching the skin on the scruff. It is important
to get a tight hold of the skin to prevent escape or
injury. Hamsters’ eyes can prolapse with a tight
 grip, but gentle pressure on the globe, pushing into
the orbit, usually resolves the problem.
Figure 5.8 Proper method for restraining a gerbil.
GERBILS
A gerbil should be restrained by cupping a hand
 over the animal's back and immobilizing its head
between the forefinger and middle finger, with
the thumb supporting the rear of the animal
(Figure 5.8). Never attempt to restrain a gerbil
by its tail, because the skin is easily removed
(Figure 5.9).
RATS
 To restrain a rat, the animal should be picked up

The other hand grasps the tail, stabilizing the ani-

on the dorsal cervical region can also be used to
pick up rats.

To restrain a mouse, the tail should be grabbed
with the thumb and forefinger, allowing the
mouse to hold on to an object with its front feet.

PHYSICAl EXAMINATION: ALL RODENTS
Prior to restraint, the veterinarian will observe
the animal's attitude, activity, and posture. The
next step is to weigh the animal in a basket on
a digital gram scale. If possible, temperature, res-
piration, and pulse should be measured and any
abnormalities in rate or character noted. The vet-

the head, looking for any abnormalities. Eyes,
ears, and nares are observed, looking for discharge
 or infammation. The oral cavity in guinea pigs is
 difficult to examine because of the small opening
and tendency for the buccal mucosa to encroach
toward the middle of the mouth. A small rabbit
speculum or an otoscope can be used to examine
the oral cavity and teeth (Figure 5.13). Mucous
membranes help determine hydration status using
capillary refill time and moisture. Body condition

Blood Collection
Guinea Pigs
In guinea pigs and other pocket pets, blood col-
lection can be quite difficult. Approximately
0.5-0.7 ml/100 grams of body weight can be
safely removed from a non-anemic, healthy guinea
pig.? For many small exotic mammal patients,
including the guinea pig. the location of choice
for blood collction is the cranial vena cava (see
Figure 5.16). Owing to the location of the cranial
vena cava and the size of other blood vessels, seda-

is recommended prior to performing the phlebot-
omy. To collect blood from the cranial vena cava,
one should do the following:
· Isolate the center of the cranial sternum and
manubrium.
· Insert a 25- to 27-gauge needle to the right of
 the manubrium at a slight angle directed toward
the opposite lateral body wall.
· Advance the needle only as negative pressure is
applied. If there is not a “Hash" of blood in the
needle hub once the needle has been inserted,

SURGICAL AND ANESTHETIC
ASSISTANCE: ALL RODENTS
 Inducing and maintaining guinea pigs, other
small rodents, and pocket pets under anesthesia
can be very challenging. There are still concerns
and differences in anesthetic protocol because of
these animals' small size, but in general, isofurane
anesthesia is a safe agent when used on a relatively
healthy surgical candidate.
An induction chamber is used to induce the

 gas anesthesia using a face mask (Figures 5.18,
5.19, and 5.20). Although it might be possible to
intubate a larger rodent or pocket pet, it is very
difficult under most conditions.& Guinea pigs will
have elevated fuid accumulation around the glot-
tis if it is irritated during intubation. The elevated
fuid will increase the difficulty of intubating the
animal and could result in aspiration or apnea. In
most cases a guinea pig can be maintained for a
 procedure in which general anesthesia is required
by using a face mask.
Guinea pigs have a tendency to regurgitate
gastric contents when under general anesthesia;
therefore, it is recommended to fast these ani-

Table 5.17 provides guidelines for surgical
 preparation and assistance in surgical procedures
on small exotic animals.
Premedication and sedation doses for rodents
are listed in Table 5.18. If the surgeon wants to
perform the procedure under injectable general
anesthesia, the doses are listed in Table 5.19.

can become overgrown, resulting in anorexia and
hypersalivation. The teeth should be trimmed on
a regular basis to prevent the inability to eat and
trauma to the tongue and buccal surface. Gen-
eral anesthesia is recommended for trimming the
molars and premolars, although the incisors can be
trimmed using regular restraint. Vitamin C defi-
ciency has been implicated as a possible contributor
to the disease process owing to the breakdown of
collagen formation in the tooth socket, causing
instability that leads to malocclusion.

INTRODUCTION
Hedgehogs are shy, nocturnal mammals from the order Insectivora.
Although these animals are known primarily for their sharp quills, there are
many other fascinating characteristics about them. In the United States, the
most common hedgehog pet species is the white-bellied, four-toed African
or African pygmy hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris).' These animals were origi-

numbers. Although they have not yet garnered the popularity of other small
exotic mammals (e.g., rabbits and guinea pigs), they have certainly found a
niche among pet owners.
Anatomy and Physiology
The most obvious anatomic peculiarity associated with hedgehogs is their
quills (Figure 6.1). Although these quills are a useful antipredator tool in
the wild, they make the job of veterinary personnel charged with examining
them challenging. When aggravated, the classic response of a hedgehog is to
"ball up." Because of their unique anatomy, they are capable of completely
sb jo lq, aqeudu ue sug pue squ ious nq u suon
Fortunately, as these animals age and are handled, they become more agree-
able to examination. In cases when they don't, general anesthesia can be
used to limit the effect of the quills.
The quills of hedgehogs are not barbed, but do come to a sharp point (Fig-
ure 6.2). There is also a misconception that they can inject venom. Although
hedgehog quills are not venomous, it is not uncommon for hedgehogs to
“anoint" their quills with saliva, which can introduce bacterial pathogens
into puncture wounds of would-be predators or unprotected handlers. When
hedgehogs are not on alert, they lay their quills down, and touching them
is analogous to peting rigid hair; however, any time hedgehogs become

defensive, they can erect their quills, using a
combination of muscles to create a protective bar-
rier. The primary muscle groups associated with
control over the quills are the front dorsalis, cau-
dodorsal, and panniculus carnosus orbicularis.
Because most hedgehogs consider a visit to the
veterinary hospital a negative experience, veteri-
nary personnel working with hedgehogs should
wear leather gloves (e.g.. welder's or gardening
gloves) to reduce the likelihood of being injured.
Hypersensitivity reactions to hedgehog quills have
been documented.
Hedgehogs are well suited for a terrestrial exis-
tence. They have long snouts that they use, similar

ity they cover only their dorsum.
ure 6.3). The eyes of hedgehogs are small, dark
(or pink in leucistic or albino animals), and set
back. They appear to rely more on their sense of
smell than on their vision. Hedgehogs have short
hair-covered ears. It is not uncommon for them
to have crusts or splints in the edges of their ears.
Although at times this finding is associated with
a mite infestation, at other times it appears to be
related to low environmental humidity. These
animals should be maintained in 30%-50%
humidity to limit the potential for dry skin. The
teeth of hedgehogs have closed roots, so dental
conditions should be managed like those of a dog
or cat. Their dental pattern is: incisors 3/2, canine
1/1, premolars 3/2, and molars 3/3. Their incisors

also have open inguinal rings, which allow them
 to move their testicles between the inguinal region
and abdomen. Females have an obvious vulva that
is cranial but close to the anus. The gestation of

a ritual called self-anointing. The animal first
licks the object, then begins to hypersalivate.
This frothy saliva is then rubbed on its skin and
spines; the purpose of this ritual is unknown.3
Some people have confused this with rabies, but
this is a normal behavior elicited under certain
conditions.
Hedgehogs are territorial, as are most small
mammals; therefore, close monitoring for fight-
ing is required when a new animal is introduced
to a group within an enclosure. Males are typi-
cally solitary, but do maintain harems. As with

Gliders
INTRODUCTION
The sugar or honey glider (Petaurus breviceps) is a marsupial that is native
to New Guinea and Australia (Figure 7.1). It is about the size of a North
American fying squirrel, generally gray with a black stripe running along
the dorsal surface from the nose to the base of the tail. These animals have
some control of the tail, which can be used as a rudder during gliding or for
carrying nest material up a tree. The second and third digits of each hind
foot are partially fused, forming a “hair comb,” which is used for grooming
their soft fur (Figure 7.2).
Male sugar gliders have three scent glands: one on top of the head (which
forms a bald spot upon maturation), another on the chest (causing an orange
or rusty discoloration of fur in that area), and one in the anal area. When
stressed or frightened, both sexes can secrete a white oily substance from
three paracloacal glands. The testicles are located in a furry pouch in the
midventral, and a bifurcated penis is ventral to the base of the tail (Figure
7.3). Male sugar gliders reach sexual maturity about 12-15 months after
they leave the pouch. The penis has a distal bifurcation and extends from
the prepuce located near the base of the tail. The urethra terminates at the
proximal aspect of the penis, not the distal bifurcation.
The female has a pouch, or marsupium, located on the ventral aspect of
the body where the young are raised as well as being the location of their
largest scent gland. Female sugar gliders do not have the bald scent gland
(on top of the head) that is found on males of this species (Figure 7.4).

INTRODUCTION
The popularity of ornamental fish dates back more than 2,000 years in
China. In the United States, interest in ornamental fish rose during the
1940s with the advent of aviation and the importation of fish from around
the world. The advancement of aquarium technologies, such as filtration
and nutrition, has enabled this hobby to continue to fourish today. In 2001,
at the time of the first edition of this text, the American Veterinary Medi-
cal Association market research statistics for pet ownership in the United
States estimated there were more than 6,000 fish per 1,000 households. In
its most recent survey (2007), the number of fish per 1,000 households has
increased by 50%, with more than 9,000 fish per household. As numbers
of the animals continue to rise, there will be increased demand for veteri-
narians and veterinary technicians to provide medical and surgical care for
these animals.
Most ornamental fish are maintained in aquariums within the home,
although the popularity of outdoor ponds continues to rise. Historically.
ornamental fish were considered replaceable pets; however, as the value of
these animals has risen, pet owners have sought the advice of veterinary
professionals to manage their valuable collections. Another contributing
factor to the change in the human-animal bond as it relates to fish is
associated with the longevity of these animals. Improved husbandry (e.g-
filtration, water treatment methods) and nutrition have helped maximize
longevity in fish. Fish that historically were short-lived (1-2 years) in the past
are now being kept alive for significantly longer periods (4-6 years). Goldfish
and koi are known to live well into their 20s and 40s, respectively. As these
animals live longer and owners become attached to their pets, veterinarians
and their technicians will be expected to give the same high-quality care that
they provide for other domestic species.

The lateral line is a mechanosensory structure
that is used by fish to monitor changes in sound

dated, but dietary deficiency, water quality, and
infectious diseases are all suspected.
The digestive tracts of fish vary depending
on their feeding strategy. Herbivorous fish have
a much longer digestive tract than omnivorous
and carnivorous fish. This relates primarily to
an increased demand for time to maximize the
extraction of nutrients from cellulose-based prod-
ucts. In many cases, segments of the bowel are
tightly coiled to conserve space within the coelo-
 mic cavity. The stomach is absent in some species,
such as the goldfsh and carp. Pyloric cecae are
found in some species of fish, which secrete
digestive enzymes and increase the absorptive
surface area of the digestive tract. The number
of pyloric cecae can be used in fish identifica-
tion to differentiate certain species. Fish possess a
large liver that is located in the cranial area of the
body cavity. The normal color of the liver should
be red-brown; however, yellow, fatty livers are a
common finding at necropsy. This is often the
result of diets rich in fats and protein.

Biologic Filtration.  Biologic  filtration relies
on bacteria to take toxic compounds and make
them less toxic (e.g., Nitrosomonas spp. oxidizes
ammonia to nitrite and Nitrobacter spp. oxidizes
nitrite to nitrate; Nitrospira spp. also plays a role
in this process). This type of filtration is the most
common form used in the home aquarium and
