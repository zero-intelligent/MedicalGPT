Preface
Skin disease is one of the most common reasons for dogs and cats to be presented to veter-
inarians and yet dermatological diagnosis and treatment can often prove troublesome. In
theory,the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions should be no differ-
ent to that used for other body systems. Clinicians must first make a diagnosis(or tentative
diagnosis)and then prescribe treatment.However,dermatological diagnosis is complicated
by thefact that the skinhas onlyalimitedrange of responses to awidevariety of cutaneous
insults.Hence,the appearance of different diseases may be similar.Furthermore,multiple
conditions may be present in the same animal causing overlap of clinical signs.The evalu-
ation of treatment is also difficult because various agentsmayhavea therapeutic effect with-
failure.
To avoid these problems,clinicians must use a logical and systematic approach when
approaching skin diseases.The steps in this approach are:
Taking a history
Performinga physical examination
Identifyingthepredominantproblems
Performing tests to rule in or out the differential diagnoses (if a diagnosis has not
already been made)
Prescribing treatment for the disease,or diseases,diagnosed
Re-inspecting the animal tomonitor theresponse to treatment
This book aims toprovide thereader with an easy-to-useguide onworking through this
process.Chapter 1 provides guidelines on how to take appropriate histories and make the
most of the information obtained.In Chapter 2,details are given on how toperform a der-
matological examination and recognise the significance ofany skinlesions that occur.Based
on theinformation obtained from thehistory and physical examination,the practitionercan
then use Chapter 3 to decide what is the mainpresenting problem,and which of the
following chapters to consult:
Chapter 4-Pruritus
Chapter5-Alopecia
Chapter 6-Scaling,crusting and seborrhoea
Chapter 7-Macular,papular and pustular diseases
Chapter 8-Draining tracts and non-healing wounds

 Chapter 11-Lumps and swellings
Chapter 12-Otitis
The use of this problem-oriented approach greatly simplifies the diagnostic process because
the skin diseases are categorised according to how they present to the clinician.Each of
thesechaptersbegins with a listof differentialdiagnosesfortheproblem.Then,foreach
condition listed,a lesion distribution diagram is shown along withkey clinical findings.
Therelevant tests that canbe used to make a specific diagnosis are also indicated.At the
end of each chapter,ageneral diagnostic approach to eachproblem ispresented in theform
of analgorithm so that the practitioner canuse the relevant tests in alogical sequence
throughout theinvestigation of the case.
Chapter13providesspecificinstructionsonhowtoperformandinterpretthevarious
diagnostic tests that areused in veterinary dermatology.For each test,a step-by-step'recipe
styleguide is provided that highlights the techniques needed to ensure good results. The
conditions that canbe diagnosedwitheachtest arelisted,alongwith an indication as to the
degree of difficulty associated with the technique and its interpretation.Numerous ex-
amples of thepotentialresults that may occurwith each test provide a comprehensiveguide
to its diagnostic interpretation.
After making a specific diagnosis (or diagnoses),the clinician can find details of specific
therapy in Chapter 14. In this chapter,the objectives and basic principles of dermatological
treatment are described,followed by aformulary-style'guide to the products that can be
used.Each section ends by describing why the treatment may not be working.and what to
do about it.
It is hoped that this bookwill prove useful toveterinary studentswho are just beginning
to learn about skin diseases,but also for practitioners who wish to improve their diagnostic
accuracywhen dealingwith thesevery common presentations.The aim is tohave produced
a book thatispracticalenough to sit in the consulting room where it can bereadily
consulted on a daily basis.

Historytaking
Taking an accurate and detailedhistory is thefirststep in any diagnostic investigation and
this is especially important for skin problems.Pet owners can provide more historical in-
formation about skin conditions than for any other body system.This is because the clinical
signsofskindiseaseareeasilyvisibleandtheownercanactuallyseelesionsdevelopand
change over time.The information obtained from the owner isvital for formulating differ-
ential diagnoses,an essential stepprior to theperformance of tests or initiation of treatment.
Howtoaskquestions
Before starting to take histories,cliniciansmust learn‘how' to ask questions.Mastering this
aspect ofhistory takingis animportantskill thatrequirespracticeandexperience.Without
it.the clinician will not be able to obtain the relevant information from the client.The way
in which questions are asked is important because it constitutes one aspect of the
veterinarian'sbedside manner'.This is critical for building the client's confidence and
ensuringsubsequentcompliancethroughout thediagnostic andtreatmentphasesofthecon-
dition.During the first few minutes of a consultation, the veterinarian must strike up an
immediate professional relationshipwith the client.In this critical phase the clinician must
appeartobe friendly,caring,compassionate,conversationalandcompetent,allat the same
time!Veterinary studentsshouldobservea number ofexperiencedpractitioners tolearn the
skillsrequired tobe successful in thismulti-faceted role.
Inaddition to the qualitiesmentioned above,cliniciansmust bevery logical and objective
when questioning clients.They need to extract information from the client that might not
otherwise be forthcoming. Clients may not mention important facts because they are not
aware of their relevance.They may also be embarrassed at disclosing information about pre-
vious home remedies or conditions involving neglect.If the clinician is not entirely con-
vincedby a particularresponse,it isoften helpful torepeat the question in a slightly different
way to determine ifthe answers areconsistent.Useful information can also be obtained by lis-
teningtootherpeopleintheexaminationroomsuchastheclient'spartnerorchildren.
In order to take a history to investigate a skinproblem,theveterinarian must become
familiar with dermatological vocabulary.However,it is important that clinicians do not
speak to clients using technical terminology that is not easily understood.The clinician
must become“bilingual',using plain language for clients,and veterinary terminology for
professional colleagues and medical records.To help students of veterinary medicine with
this important process,Table 1.1 provides a list of terms that are used to describe skin con-
ditions,along with a suitable‘translation'that most clients would likely use or understand.
Precise definitionsof these termsareprovidedlater in the textwhenthey are encountered.

Whattypeofhistorytotake
Ifanymeaningful informationis tobeobtainedfrom thehistory,it isimportantfor the
clinician toknow what questions to ask,and therelevance of the answersgiven by the
client.This is a difficult aspect of history taking to learn because it requires a sound
knowledgeofdermatologicalconditionsaswell asgeneralmedicine.
There are three basic typesof history that can be used to evaluate skindiseases:
1.The partial history
2.The complete history
3.The recheck history.
Thepartialhistory
Thepartialhistory involvesaskingafewfocusedquestions about thespecificskinproblem
presentedby the owner and onlygenerateslimited information.Although this type ofhis-
torytakingiscommonly employed byveterinarysurgeons,it should beavoidedexceptfor
cases that fulfil the following criteria:
Thediagnosisisimmediatelyobviousassoonastheclientmentionstheproblem

ingand iscoveredinfleas.

status ismonitored regularly.

The complete history
The complete history provides comprehensive details of the animal's dermatological prob-
lem as well as its general health status (see below). Ideally,this type of history should be
obtained at the onset of any skin condition.In practice,this can be difficult to achieve due
to time constraints.Nevertheless,the clinician should be aware of how to perform a com-
plete history and should utilise this approach in any case in which a diagnosis can not eas-
ily bemade at the first consultation.For the busy practitioner,it may benecessary to arrange
togetheroveraseriesofappointments.
Therecheckhistory
It is not necessary to obtain a complete history when re-evaluating animals that areunder-
going treatment.This is because most of the information will be the same as that obtained
during the initial consultation.Hence,when performing a recheck history,the clinician
should focus on two main aspects:
Is the treatment working?
Have there been any problems or adverse effects associated with the treatment?
Takingacompletehistory
The components of a complete dermatological and generalmedical history are summarised
inTable 1.2.This information should be committed tomemory so that questions are not for-
tory whereas others prefer to obtain the generalmedical historyfirst.This ispurely a matter
of preference and is not important as long as the clinician decides on a particular system
and uses it routinely.To help with this process,some veterinary dermatologists convert the
information in the table into a questionnaire that can befilled inby the clientprior to enter-
ing the examination room.Other clinicians use the table as a checklist that is completed
during the consultation.
Therelevance of the information obtained during the completehistory is asfollows:
Patient details
The basicpatient detailswill normally beknown for animals that arealready registeredwith
a practice.If not,this information should be obtainedbefore the start of the main consulta
tion.Some of this information,especially the signalment (age,sex,breed),is very important
in helping to generate differential diagnoses.
Age of the animal
It is important toknow the animal's age because some skin disorders can show age-related
onset. Congenital and hereditary diseases usually occur in young animals whereas meta-
bolic and neoplastic diseases are more likely in older animals.Table 1.3 lists some diseases
that typically show age-related onset.Note that thismaynotbe the age atwhich the animal
presents for the problem.

Breed
Many skin diseaseshave hereditary influences and show strikingbreed predilections (Table
1.4). This information is vital when generating lists of differential diagnoses.
Originofthe animal
It isimportant toknow when theanimalwas acquiredby the owner,and fromwhere.If the
animal has been in the owner's possession for all of its life,it is likely that thehistory of the
conditionis knownfrom the outset.However,if the animal has only just been obtained and
has a pre-existing condition, much of the history will be unknown. The source of the ani-
mal is also important. If the animal was obtained as a stray or purchased from a rescue cen-
tre,it is more likely to have a parasitic,infectious or nutritional problem.Alternatively. if
the animalwas obtained from a breeder,itmaybe possible to gain information about the
familial nature of the condition.
Vaccinationandwormingstatus
Theprevious vaccination andworminghistory of the animal shouldberecorded as baseline
information,and in countries in whichheartworm is present,details of the preventative
used should be obtained.Although important,this information is not as helpful in generat-
ing differential diagnoses for skin conditions as it is for some other body systems. This is
because skin conditions associated withviruses and internal parasites are quite rare.Ex-
ampleswould be the rare conditions of footpad hyperkeratosis associatedwith canine dis-
temper virus infection:dermatoses associated with felineleukaemia virus and feline
immunodeficiency virus; facial dermatosis due to feline herpes virus infection:pododer-
matitis due topenetration ofhookworm larvae:pruritus associatedwith intestinal helminth
hypersensitivity:andcutaneousnodulesassociatedwithDirofilariaimmitislarvae.

Whatistheowner'smaincomplaint?
It is important to establish from the outset what the client perceives tobe the main problem.
Themostcommon dermatologicalproblemspresented toveterinarysurgeons are:
Pruritus
Alopecia
Lumps and swellings
Otitis.
Less common problemsnoticed by clients includevisible skin lesions such as:
Excessive scaling
Papulo-pustular eruptions (rashes).
Rareproblemspresentedbyclientsinclude:
Ulcerative lesions
Draining tracts or non-healing wounds
Changes in the animal's skin or coat colour.
Identifying the predominant problem is thefirst step in generating a differential diagnosis
for skin disorders.
Howlong hastheproblembeenpresent?
Thelength of time that a skin problem hasbeen present can have a profound effect on its
appearance.Parasitic conditions may spread,hypersensitivities may become more severe,
skin tends to react to continued injury by developing certainpathological changes such
as lichenification and hyperpigmentation.These chronic changes can mask important
diagnostic information such as typical lesion distributions and the presence ofprimary
lesions.
Whatwastheconditionlikeatthebeginning?
An accurate description of what theownerfirst noticed can overcome some of theproblems
associatedwith chronic skinproblems.It is important toestablish whatwere the initial clin
ical signs,what lesions were seen and whatwas their distribution.For example,a dog may
present with generalised pruritus.However,on questioning.the owner may reveal that the
problem initially only affected the face and feet.As many skin conditions have fairly pre-
cise distribution patterns such as this,the information enables the clinician to prioritise the
differential diagnosis list.
Howhastheproblemchanged over time?
It isimportant to ask the client how the skin condition has changed since they first noticed
it.This can also overcome some of the problems associated with chronicity.For example,a
dogmay present with pruritus of afew months'duration.However,on careful questioning
the ownermayreveal thatthefirstlesions seenwere symmetricalpatches ofalopeciaand
scaling over the trunk.These areas then developed a red rash that the dogstarted scratching
at.In this case,although the owner has presented the dog for pruritus,it is not the predom-
inantproblem.The clinician should direct the diagnostic effort towards the cause of the
alopecia and scaling.
Avtorsko zasciteno gradivo

11
It is also important to determine the rate and pattern of changes.Skin conditions can:
Progress rapidly - e.g. parasitic conditions, infectious conditions, auto-immune
diseases
Progress slowly-e.g.allergic diseases,endocrine diseases,skin tumours
Wax and wane - e.g.allergic diseases
●Change with the seasons e.g. allergic diseases,seasonal parasites,seasonal alopecia.
Furtherspecificinformationaboutpruritus
Pruritus is a sensation in the skin thatleads to a desire to scratch.It is the mostcommon
problem mentionedbydogownersduringadermatologicalhistoryand canbemanifested
as scratching,chewing.licking.rubbing,rolling.or head shaking.In cats,pruritus is less
commonlynoticed by owners andis usuallymanifested as either scratching or excessive
grooming.
Determining if an animal is pruritic or not is one of themost important questions in a der-
matological history.Thisisbecause most of the common conditions inveterinary dermato-
logyarepruriticand theclinician isimmediatelyabletodevelopalistofdifferential
diagnoses.As pruritus can not be accurately assessed on physical examination,it is up to
the client to providemore detailed historical information than for the other presenting prob-
lems.To extract this information,the clinician should ask questions about three specific
aspects of thepruritus:
1.The distribution
2.The severity
3.The onset relative to other skin lesions.
Distribution
When assessing the distribution,the clinician should avoid askingthequestionWhere does
the animal scratch？ This usually yields incomplete information.Instead,the client should
be asked ‘Is the animal itchy at any of the following sites?:muzzle; face; around the eyes;
ears; neck; back; the sides of the chest and flanks; belly;under the tail; the legs: or the feet.
This type of detailed questioning usually provides muchmore accurate information than
merely asking the client torecall thedistribution.
Severity
The clinician should then try to ascertain the severity of the pruritus.This is important for
two reasons.First, some diseases are severely pruritic (e.g.canine scabies,acute moist der-
matitis,feline eosinophilic plaque) whereas others may be very mildly pruritic(e.g. demo-
dicosis,dermatophytosis). Second,the level of pruritus at initial presentation is used as a
startingpoint to monitor the subsequentresponse to treatment.
However, assessing the level of pruritus can be particularly difficult because there is no
objective scale that the clinician canuse.The clinician has to rely on information provided
by the client and what is observed in the consulting room.Although there is no perfect way
ofrecordingtheseverity ofpruritus,mostveterinarydermatologistuseoneof threesystems:
Basic descriptors such as mild, moderate or severe. Although this is simple to use,
the restriction to only three categories means that it is not particularly useful for
assessingmarginal improvements in the condition.
A numerical score (usually between 0 and 1o).In this system,clients are usually
told that 0 is a normal dogand 10 is continuous scratching.The problem with this

system is that clients have nothing to compare their animal to,so it is inherently
inaccurate.Hence,they tend to over-estimate the severity of pruritus.However,it
does provide a starting point against which future comparisons can be made.
●An itch scale based on more complex written descriptors (see Box). Although this
allowsanowner tochoose alevel ofpruritusbasedonsome objectivecriteria,it can
be difficult to place some animals into a specific category.However,owners are less
likely to grossly over-estimate the severity of pruritus with this system than with the
other two.
Clinicians should decide for themselves which system they thinkbest suits their needs.This
is likely to be based on their relative interest in the discipline,their dermatological caseload
and their own style of consulting.
Onsetrelative toother skinlesions
Determining if thepruritus camebefore or after the development of otherskin lesions is crit-
ically important when assessing the history of a particular skin condition. This allows the
clinician to determine if they are dealing primarily with a pruritic disease that may have
lead to the skin lesions, or if the pruritus is merely a complication of the original disease.
For example, if the animal was pruritic and then developed patches of alopecia, it may
imply that the hair loss is merely due to self-trauma.In this case,treatment of the cause of
the pruritus would also resolve the alopecia.However,if the hairloss preceded the pruritus,
it suggests that a complicating factor of the alopecia (such as secondary infection) has
caused the pruritus.In this case, treatment of the pruritus would not resolve the original
condition.This concept is often summarised by veterinary dermatologists as follows:if an
animal has a rash,find out if it is a rash that itches,or an itch that rashes!
History taking
13
Istheconditioncontagious?
Establishingif a condition is contagious canbeveryhelpfulwhen trying to establish the
cause of skin conditions.The client should be asked if there are any other animals or people
in the house that have skin lesions.If so,the clinician should determine if the conditions
might be related.The skin conditions that most commonly affect other animals andpeople
include fleabite dermatitis,scabies,cheyletiellosis and dermatophytosis.
Is there any familial history?
Owners should be asked if they can provide any medical details about the animals sire,dam
or siblings.Thisis usefulfor conditions that areknown tohavehereditaryinfluences such
as atopic dermatitis. Unfortunately, in most cases, owners will not be able to provide this
information.
Haveanyprevioustreatmentsbeenadministered?
Animals with skin diseases are often re-presented after being seen by a professional col-
league or for a second opinion.Hence, previous treatments may have been prescribed by
another veterinary surgeon.Alternatively,treatmentsmay havebeen administered by the
client themselves. There is also a whole range of products that are available in pet shops,
pharmacies or health food stores that can be used by clients to treat skin diseases.These
include flea control products,shampoos,powders,creams,ornutritional supplements.It is
important to establish precisely what drugs or products havebeen used prior to the animal
being presented.It is also important to establish howlong these treatments were used for
and if any were effective.This information may provide the clinician with clues as to the
possible cause of the condition.However, the information should be interpreted with
caution because some supposed homeremedies are totally ineffective.On the other hand,
some veterinary prescribed drugs can appear to be very effective without yielding any
diagnostic information.The previous use of glucocorticoids to treat pruritus would be a
good example of the latter problem.
Whatdoestheanimaleat?
Owners often think that their dog or cat's skin disease maybe associated with its diet.This
is much rarer than is commonly believed.However, the clinician should record precise
details of what the animal eats, including meat sources (canned or fresh), dry food (com-
plete,mixer,biscuits),treats or scraps,and nutritional supplements(vitamins,minerals,
oils,etc).The ownershould alsobe asked if theyhave attempted to change the diet in order
to influence the skin condition.Skin conditions thatmay be associated with diet include
food intolerance (food allergy),zinc responsive dermatosis and seborrhoea.
Wheredoestheanimal live?
Althoughmost skin diseases can occur anywhere in theworld,some haveveryprecisegeo-
graphical distributions.These are usually caused by specific parasites or infectious agents
that require particular habitats or climatic conditions.Some are restricted to certain coun-
tries whereas others are restricted to certain regions within a country. In other cases,
although the condition is not restricted to one area,it may be much more common than in
other areas.Hence,clinicians shouldinitiallybecome aware of the conditions that are
known to be restricted to,or prevalent in,their own area.This information is best obtained
Avtorsko zasciteno gradivo

from other clinicians that have been working in the area for some time.Some examples
include:
Fleas -not present incertainparts of the world that are athigh altitude or
extremely dry
Notoedres cati -restricted to certain regions in certain countries(e.g.parts of the
USA.parts of the Mediterranean basin,virtuallyabsent from the UK)
Trombicula autumnalis (harvest mites,berry bugs)-restricted to certain parts of
the UK

Histoplasmosis-only found in the Mississippi region of the USA
Coccidiomycosis-only found in the southwesternregions of the USA
Cryptococcosis-found inUSAand Australia but rarelyin UK
Sporotrichosis -found in USA but extremely rare in UK.
It islikely that the clinicianwill alreadyknowwhere the animal liveswithouthaving to ask
the client.However,it is important to ask if the animal has ever lived in,or recently trav-
elled to,another area.This is particularlyimportant now that the quarantinelaws have been
relaxed in some countries,including the UK.
In addition toknowing the geographical location in which the animal resides,the clin-
ician should obtain detailsof the animal'shome environment.This shouldincludewhether
itis a rural orurban environment,where the animal sleeps(kennel,kitchen,bedroom,etc.),
whether ithasfreerange in thehouse andwhether any environmental changeshavebeen
made by the owner.Thisinformation can be useful in the investigation of allergic disorders
such as atopic dermatitis andcontact dermatitis.
Generalmedical history
Inthe majority of cases of skin disease,the animal is systemically well and willnot have
any other relevant clinical signs.Conditions thatmay result insystemic as well as derma-
tological signs are summarised in Table 1.5.These conditions tend to fall into a number of
categories such as endocrine diseases,immune-mediated diseases，severe infections/
infestations andneoplasia.Note that this tableonlyincludes conditionsthat have
dermatological manifestations and does not list other causes of the clinical signs.

Physicalexamination
After obtainingahistory.a completedermatological andgeneralphysical examination
shouldbeperformed.Although it is temptingtofocusimmediatelyon thevisuallystriking
skin lesions pointed out by the client,this should be avoided.Instead,clinicians should
develop alogical system of examination of both the skin and internal organs.Once estab-
lished,thisroutine shouldbeapplied to everycase.This approach ensures that lesions that
have not been noticed by the client are not missed.As with history taking.it is the clini
cian's ownpreference as towhether thedermatologicalexaminationorgeneral examination
isperformedfirst.
Examinationoftheskin
There are threemajor aimswhenperforminga dermatologicalexamination:
1.To detect the presence of grossly visible parasites
2.To identify anylesions that are present
3.Todeterminethe distribution of thelesions.
Itisimportant toestablisharoutinewhenexaminingtheskinsothat thewholebodyarea
is covered.The clinician should first observe the entire animal from a distance tojudge the
appearance of its coat. Then, the skin and coat should be examined in detail under good
lighting.Usually. the examination starts at the head and proceeds distally.The clinician
should examine themuzzle,lips,chin,nasalplanum,face,periocularregion,medialand
lateral aspects of the pinnae,ear canals,dorsal and ventral neck,dorsum,lateral chest,tail,
perineum,axillae,ventral abdomen,legs,interdigital areas and pads.
Whilst examining these body regions,the clinician should feel the quality of the coat and
determine ifit is dry,greasy or easily epilated.The clinician should alsolookforgrosslyvis-
ible ectoparasitessuch asfleas,lice or Trombiculalarvae,or clues to theirpresence such as
flea dirt or lice eggs.The skin surface should then be carefully examined by running the fin-
gers against thelay of thehair. If necessary,the hair coat may need tobe clipped in order to
visualisesubtlelesions thatwould otherwisebe hidden.It may alsobe occasionallyhelpful
to use a magnifying glass to assessvery small lesions.
An important technique that can be used to help assess the degree of pruritus in dogs is
digital stimulation.As each body region is examined,the surface of the skin should be
firmly scratched with one ormore fingernails.If the skin is pruritic,this may trigger a reflex
scratching action of the dog's hind leg.If this occurs when the margins of the pinnae are
scratched, it is known as the pinnal-pedal scratch reflex and is suggestive of canine scabies.
This technique can be used to determine if the skin is generally pruritic or if the pruritus is
restricted toparticularlesions.If thereflex is elicitedwhen a singlelesion is stimulated,but

stops when an adjacent patch of normal skin is scratched,it indicates that the pruritus is
resulting from the lesions themselves.This distinction becomes critical when dealing with
staphylococcal pyoderma,a secondaryinfection that canbesuperimposed onmany otherskin
conditions.With this technique, the clinician may be able to predict if the pruritus will
resolve following treatment of the bacterial lesions alone.
In addition toobserving and touching the skin,the clinician should also smell the skin.
Many disorders of the skin or ears lead to changes in the animal's body odour.Disorders
known to produce characteristic odours include canine scabies(mousy odour),Malassezia
otitis (yeasty odour),anal sac problems (musky odour),seborrhoea oleosa rancid fat
odour)and anaerobic infections and abscesses(putrid,necrotic odour).
As the examination progresses, the clinician must characterise and record any skin
lesions that are observed.For this tobe meaningful,cliniciansmust have a complete under-
standingof thevarious typesoflesionsthatcan occurontheskinandtheirdiagnostic
significance.
Skinlesions
The skin can only respond to injury in a limited number of ways.These pathological
diseases,clinicians must learn to understand this language and appreciate what the skin is
trying to say. However, clinicians should be aware that a single type of lesion is rarely
pathognomonicfor a particular disease,in the same way thata singleword does not convey
asmuch meaning as a sentence.The information derived from all the lesions must therefore
be assimilated andprocessed,allowing the clinician to determinewhatmajorpatternsof
changes are present.
Skin lesions can be classified in a number ways.Many veterinarydermatologists like to
describe lesions as either primary or secondary.Primary lesions occur as a direct result of
the disease process whereas secondarylesions result from progression of the disease or self-
some skin lesionscan be either primary or secondarydepending on the disease concerned
so this classification can, at times,be confusing.
In this book,skin lesions will be classified into categories based on how they actually
appear to the clinician during a dermatological examination.These categories are:
loss of hair
changes in skin colour
rashes
excessive scaling
changes in skin thickness
draining tracts
Odefects in skin integrity
abnormal components on the skin surface
●lumps and swellings.
Loss of hair
Loss of hair is a common presenting sign in both dogs and cats.It may occur spontaneously or
be secondary topruritus.Spontaneous alopecia is a cardinal sign of disorders affecting the
hair follicle such asfollicular infections and endocrine diseases.If secondary to pruritus,
Avtorsko zasciteno gradivo

18
the hair is removed by the animal itself by scratching.rubbing,biting,chewing or excessive
grooming.Termsused to describehair loss include:
Alopecia may be partial,in which the hair density is merely reduced,or total,in
which the area of affected skin is devoid of hair.In animals,alopecia usually occurs
as one of fourpatterns:
Focal-a single,smallpatch of alopecia
-Multi-focal - multiple, small, circular patches of alopecia giving the coat a moth-
eaten appearance
=Regional=alopecia affecting a region of thebody such as oneleg
一
Symmetrical-alopeciathathas thesamedistributionononesideof thebodyas

Hypotrichosis-less than the normal amount of hair.This term is rarely used in
veterinary dermatology and normally describes a congenital deficiency of hair
Defluxion/effluvium-asudden,widespreadlossofhair
Easy epilation - the ability to easily remove excessive quantities of hair with little
resistance during physical examination.Thisimplies thatmanyhairs arein theresting
(telogen)phase.This can bephysiological(due to shedding)or pathological.When an
animal is shedding.it is not possible to remove enoughhair to leave apatch of alope-
cia.Hence,regardlessoftheamountofhairbeingremoved,theownercanbereassured
that nothingiswrong.Onthe otherhand,iftheepilationleadsto thedevelopment ofa

terisedby alackofhair andpigment,areslightlyraisedandmayhaveashinysur
face.Linear scars are usually hidden by the hair coat in animals.More extensive
scars are visible as large patches of alopecia.Because scars lack hair follicles, the
alopecia is irreversible.
Changesinskincolour
Thenormal skin of dogs and cats isusually awhitish-grey colour,even if the animal has a
black coat.In animals with black and white or tricolour coats,some areas of skin may be
naturallypigmentedbutthisisusually adarkish-greycolourratherthanblack.Somewhite
coated breedssuch asEnglishBull Terriers andWestHighlandWhite Terriers havepale
pink coloured skin that can becomemoreintensewhen the dogis excited.Many skin con
ditions lead to a change in colour of theskin.These colour changes include:
Erythema =skin that is redder than normal,implying that the skin is inflamed.
Erythema occurs most commonly in allergic,parasitic,infectious and immune-
mediated skin diseases.Erythroderma refers to generalised erythema.
Hyperpigmentation-skin that is darker thannormal.
Excessive pigment in the epidermisleads toblack coloured skin.This occurs most
commonly as a chronic change in allergic diseases and Malassezia dermatitis,and
as ahormonaleffect inendocrinedisorders.
Excessive pigment in the dermis leads to blue-grey coloured skin.This occurs most
commonlyin demodicosis.
Hypopigmentation - skin or hair that is paler than normal.
Loss of pigment from the skin orhair may result fromhereditary.autoimmune,
nutritional,neoplastic and idiopathic diseases.

Macules -circular,flat areas of abnormally coloured skin,up to 1 cm in diameter.
Erythematousmacules are commonly caused by staphylococcal pyoderma and
fleabitehypersensitivity.They are also seenwithflybites,contact dermatitis,and
erythema multiforme.
Haemorrhagic macules (ecchymoses) may be seen with vasculitis and coagu-
lopathies.
Hyperpigmented macules are commonly seenwith staphylococcalpyoderma at
the sites of resolving lesions and on the scrotum,prepuce and anus associated
with testicular tumours.
-Hypopigmented macules maybe seen with vitiligoand idiopathic depigmentation.
Rashes
A rash is a collection of skin lesionsusually comprised of erythematous macules,papules
and pustules (maculo-papulo-pustular eruption).
Erythematousmacules-definedabove.
Papules - small,red, circular pimples less than 1 cm in diameter.
Papulesaremost commonly seenwithstaphylococcalpyoderma,fleabitehypersen-
sitivity,scabies，atopic dermatitis,fly bite hypersensitivity and contact dermatitis.
Clinicians should be extremely careful in distinguishing a papular eruption from
erythema.Erythema is a diffuse area of inflamed skin whereas a papular eruption
will appear mottled with areas of normal skin interspersed amongst the papules.
However,with severepapular eruptions,the lesions canbecome contiguous so the
clinician needs tolook carefully atthe edge of the densepatch of inflammation to
see the individuallesions.
Pustules -red,circular spots containing a central,yellow sac of pus.
Pustules are commonly seenwith staphylococcalpyoderma butmay also occurwith
demodicosis,pemphigus and some rare sterile pustular disorders.
OCrusted papules and pustules -papules and pustules covered in a small crust (scab).
Theselesions are commonly seen alongsidepapules andpustules and imply that
pus or exudate has come onto the surface and dried. Crusted papules are commonly
seen in miliary dermatitis in cats. Crusted pustules are seen in all pustular diseases
due to thefragilenatureof canine andfelinepustules.
or maynot behyperpigmented) surrounded bya rim oferythemawith a ringof
peripheral scaling(an epidermal collarette).
Excessive scaling
Innormal skin,the superficiallayers of the stratum corneum（corneocytes)arebeingcon-
tinuously desquamatedinto the environment.These cells aremicroscopicso arenotvisible
on the skinsurface or in the coat.However,in some disease states,thisprocessis disrupted
leading to visible skinlesions.
Scale-grosslyvisible accumulations of corneocytes(dandruff).Excessivescale may
form as a result of any disease that disrupts the normal process of cornification.
Seborrhoea - a descriptive,clinical term referring to any skin condition charac-
terised by excessive scaling or greasiness.Seborrhoea sicca is used to describe the
Avtorsko zascitenogradivo

appearance of dry and scaly skin. Seborrhoea oleosa is used to describe the appear-
ance of excessively greasy skin.
Epidermal collarette-a circular ring of scale.Epidermal collarettes are formed
when a focal point of infection spreads outwards as an enlarging circle,causing
the stratum corneum to lift upwards.The end result is a circular patch of alopecia
surroundedbyarimofscale.Thisextremelycommonlesionisinvariablyasso-
ciated with staphylococcal pyoderma and may be seen alone or in conjunction
with papules and pustules.An epidermal collarette often surrounds a staphylo-
coccalring.
Exfoliation - the shedding of very large sheets of scale over large areas of the body.
Hyperkeratosis-a pathological termmeaning thickeningof the stratum corneum.On
the skin surface,hyperkeratosis is only seen histologically.It would be manifested
clinically as excessive visible scale. Clinically,the term hyperkeratosis should only
be used for pathological accumulations of thick,adherent keratin on the nasal
planum or the footpads.
OComedone-anaccumulationofkeratinwithinahair follicle(blackhead).Com
edonesoccurwithdiseases thataffecthairfolliclessuch asdemodicosis,endocrine
diseases and cornification defects.
Follicular cast -an adherent sheath of scale surrounding a hair shaft above the skin
surface.This lesion results from follicular hyperkeratosis and is usually found in
associationwith cornification defects.
Changesinskinthickness
Some conditionslead to a change in skin thickness.Increased skin thickness canbe caused
by thickening of the epidermis or dermis,or infiltration of theskinwith inflammatory cells.
Decreased skin thickness occurs due to a combined thinning of the epidermis and dermis.
Lichenification-a marked thickening of the skin due to a dramatic increase in
thickness of the epidermis.Lichenification leads to an exaggeration of the visible
skin markings so that the skin looks like that of an elephant.It is an attempt by the
body to protect itselffrom further injury byforminga thicker defensivebarrier
Lichenification often occurs in combination with hyperpigmentation which is
another defensive mechanism.Lichenification most commonly occurs with chronic
pruritic skin diseases.
Plaque -a localised patch of thickened skin with a flat surface.Plaques are either
causedbythickeningof theepidermisorbyinfiltrationof inflammatoryorneoplastic
cells.The most common exampleis feline eosinophilicplaques.
Callus -a thickened,rough,alopecic,lichenified plaque that forms over pressure
points
Myxoedema -a puffy,thickening of the skin caused by excessive quantities of
mucin in the dermis.This is a feature that can be seen with hypothyroidism and in
the ChineseShar Peibreed of dog.
Cutaneous atrophy-skin that isvisibly thinner than normal.This may be appreci-
ated because the cutaneousbloodvesselsbecome moreprominent or the skin may
become hypotonic.Hypotonic skin is less elastic and is easily wrinkled.Cutaneous
atrophymaybe seen with hyperadrenocorticism and following the excessivelocal
use of glucocorticoids (topical application of creams or subcutaneous injections).

Draining tracts
Furunculosis-rupture of hair follicles beneath the skin surface.Furunculosis nor-
mallyoccursdue tobacterialinfection ordemodicosisandresultsinsinustracts
Sinus-an opening between the underlying dermis or subcutis and the skin surface,
through which exudate is normally discharging. Sinuses are normally associated
with deep infections.
Defectsinskinintegrity
Themost common example of a defect in skin integrity is a wound.A wound is a traumat-
ically or surgically inducedbreachinskincontinuity.Themanagement of woundswill not
becoveredin thistextandreaders should seekfurtherinformationfrom surgical textbooks.
Other defects in skin integrity that canbe caused by dermatological problems include:
Erosion-a shallow defect inwhich the epidermisismissingbut thebasement mem
brane is intact.
Ulcer -a deeper defect in which the epidermis is absent exposing the underlying
dermis.In dogs and cats,the epidermis is so thin that virtually all erosions become
ulcers.Ulcers can be caused by diseases that damage the epidermis or underlying
dermis (autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases,deep infections, severe self-
trauma,neoplasia,burns).
Vesicle-a blisterless than 1 cm in diameter.Blisters form due tolack of cohesion
between the epidermis and dermis.Theresulting space becomes filledwith tissue
fluid. In dogs and cats, the epidermis is so thin that vesicles on the skin are virtu-
ally never seen.Diseases that would cause cutaneous blisters inhumans cause
ulcers in dogs and cats.However,vesicles can rarely be seen in the oral cavity of
dogs and catswhere the epithelium is thicker.Blistering disorders are caused by
autoimmune or congenital diseases of the epidermis or dermo-epidermal junction.
Bulla -a large blister greater than 1 cm in diameter,virtually never seen in dogs and
cats.
Excoriation = a defect (scratch) in the skin caused by trauma (thorns,barbed wire
etc.) or self-trauma.Excoriations often have a linear configuration and may be
grouped inparallel rows that correspond to the animal's claws.Excoriations due to
self-trauma occurwithpruriticdiseases.
underlyingdermis.Fissuresusually occurwithdiseasesthataffect thenasalplanum

Abnormalcomponentsontheskinsurface
Exudate-a mixture of bodyfluids and cells that comes out onto the skin surface.
Exudates may _contain pus, serum and/or blood and are usually associated with
infections or ulcerative diseases.
OCrust-an adherentmixture of stratum corneum and other components such as
serum, blood or pus. Crusts form when exudates or blood dry on the skin surface.
Hyperhidrosis - excessive quantities of sweat on the skin surface.Hyperhidrosis
maybe seen with inflammatory skin diseases,especially atopic dermatitis.
Calcinosis cutis-deposition of calcium into the dermis whichmay penetrate
through to the exterior exposing white,chalky pieces of grit-like material.
Calcinosis cutis can be seen with hyperadrenocorticism.

Lumps and swellings
Thepresence of acutaneouslumpor swelling isone of themost common reasonsfordogs
and cats to be presented to veterinary surgeons.For obvious reasons,lumps are a source of
great anxiety for owners and the clinician should try and determine as quickly aspossible
what has caused thelump to occur.
Abscess-a cavity in the skinfilledwithpus.Abscesses areinvariably causedby
infections,although sterile abscesses can rarely form at the sites of injections.
oHaematoma-a cavityin theskinfilledwithblood.Haematomasareusually caused
by trauma.
Wheal-a circumscribed,circular,raised area of skin caused by oedema in the
dermis. Wheals are seen in urticaria,an immediate hypersensitivity reaction.
Wheals are alsoproduced atthe site of positive skin testreactions when animals
are allergy tested.
Cyst- an epithelial lined cavity filled with skin components such as keratin, cor-
neocytes, hair or sebum.
Nodule-a firm,solid cutaneous swelling up to 1 cm in diameter caused by infil-
tration of inflammatory or neoplastic cells.
Tumour -a solid mass of tissue caused by infiltration or expansion of neoplastic
cells.
Lesiondistribution
Whilst assessing the type of lesions, the clinician must also record their distribution. The
distribution ofskinlesionsisoneofthemostimportantclinicalfeaturesusedtoprioritise
thedifferentialdiagnosislistbecausemanydermatoses have characteristic distribution
patterns.
There are two ways in which this information can be recorded.Most veterinary surgeons
write down details of the distribution as the examination progresses.However,amore useful
methodusedby themajority ofveterinarydermatologistsis torecord theinformation on a
lesion distribution diagram.An example suitable forphotocopying and placing in the
animal'srecord is shown inFigure 2.1.
In addition tobeingquick and easy to perform,thismethod provides a visualreference that
is useful to refer back to when monitoring progress. It is also valuable when cases are seen by
more than one clinician during the course of treatment.Anexample ofa completedlesion dis-
tribution diagram is shown in Figure 2.2.
The distribution of lesions provides important clues as to the possible diagnosis. Some
typical distribution patterns include:
Regional - only one part of the body is affected such as a leg or the nasal planum.
Multi-regional-a number of different body sites are affected such as the face,ears,
legs and ventrum.
OGeneralised-virtually thewholeskinsurfaceisaffected.
Symmetrical-thelesions are the same on one side of the body as on the other.This
is usually seen with parasitic,allergic,autoimmune,endocrine or systemic diseases.
Non-symmetrical-lesions on one side of the body are not mirrored on the other.
This is usually seen with infectious or neoplastic diseases.
Details on the distribution oflesions invarious skin diseases areprovided in Chapters 4-12.

Pruritus
Differentialdiagnosis
Pruritus is the most common presenting dermatological problem in dogsand cats.In the
majority ofcases,pruritus is caused by either an ectoparasite,an infectious agentor an
allergy.Table4.1 shows the major differential diagnosesfor pruritusin dogsand cats.Most
of the diseasescanbe seen in both specieswith the exception of Sarcoptesscabiei(usually
only seen in dogs).Notoedres cati (only seenin cats)and staphylococcal pyoderma(rarely
seen in cats).
In dogs,the clinical signs of thesediseases are fairlycharacteristic(seebelow).Hence,the
lesions and their distribution provide important clueswhen prioritising the differential
diagnoses.However,in cats,the situation ismuchlessclear cut.Catswith pruritus tend to
presentwithone of thefollowingfourcutaneousreactionpatterns:

Generaldiagnosticapproachtopruriticskindiseases
Inmany cases of pruritic skin disease,the history and clinical signs will be suggestive of a
particular condition.In these cases,the diagnosis can usually be confirmed by the use of
a few appropriate diagnostic tests.However, in other cases, making a diagnosis is not so
simple. This usually occurs when:
The animal has more than one disease at the same time.This leads to over-lapping
of the clinical signs andlesion distribution patterns.A typical examplewould be a
dog with atopic dermatitis and secondary staphylococcaland Malassezia infections.
The animal has a clinicalpresentation that can be caused by multiple diseases.An
examplewould bethe feline cutaneousreactionpatterns.
The animal has a disease that can closely resemble another one.An examplewould
be the over-lapping lesion distribution patterns of atopic dermatitis, scabies and
Malassezia dermatitis.
In these more difficult cases, it is important to follow a logical diagnostic sequence to rule
out the various possibilities.Figure 4.1 shows a diagnostic algorithm that can be used to
investigate such cases.It is important to remember that this algorithm is only a guide and
the clinician must use the information obtained from the history and physical examination
toprioritise theinitial differential diagnosis list.Thismay allow some of the steps tobeby-
passed.For example,if a dog presented solely for foot chewing,it would not be necessary

pruritic, this should be investigated first (see Chapter 1). This chapter is concerned with
non-pruritic, spontaneous hair loss.
When investigating the possible causes of alopecia,it is useful to divide the differential
diagnoses into categories based on their presenting pattern. Table 5.1 does this by showing
the major differential diagnosesfor localised alopecia,multi-focalalopecia and symmetrical
alopecia.
Clinical featuresof alopecicskin diseases
Demodicosis(Demodecticmange)
Aetiology: Excessive proliferation of demodex mites in the hair follicles or on the skin surface.
Demodicosis in juvenile dogs is thought to be due to a defect in the skin immune system.
Adult-onset demodicosis(over 4years of age) may be secondary to hyperadrenocorticism,
hypothyroidism,other internal diseases,malignancies,excessive use of glucocorticoids or
idiopathic.
Predominantlesions:

Lesion distribution:
Three main forms of demodicosis are seen,but there is overlapbetween the presentations:
1. Localised demodicosis -Few focal patches of alopecia on the face and legs.
2.Generalised demodicosis-Multifocal or diffuse lesions over the face,legs and trunk.

Telogen/Anagendefluxion
Aetiology:Telogendefluxion occurswhen largenumbersof hair follicles are synchronised
in the telogen phase during a period ofendocrine disease,stress,illness,pregnancy or lac-
tation.When the endocrine disease is treated,theillness or stressresolves,or thelactation
is over,thehair folliclesreturn to anagen.Thenewhairspush the old hairsoutresultingin

Generaldiagnosticapproachtoalopecia
When approaching theproblem of alopecia,it isimportant to note the similarities in many
of the diseases described above under each presenting pattern.For example, staphylococcal
pyoderma,demodicosisand dermatophytosismayall look the same on clinicalexamina-
tion.In the dog.staphylococcal infection and demodicosiswould be the most likely causes
of thispattern，whereas in cats,dermatophytosis wouldbemorelikely.Someof themore
generalised alopecias such as endocrine diseases and follicular dysplasias can also appear
remarkably similar.
Hence,as with pruritus,it is important to adopt a logical diagnostic approach that
systematically rules out the various possibilities.Figures 5.1,5.2 and 5.3 show diagnostic
algorithmsforlocalised,multi-focal and symmetrical alopecia respectively.Asfor pruritus,
the clinician should superimpose their clinical experience on the approach suggested in
these flow-charts.

Generaldiagnosticapproachtoscalingdisorders
As with the problems of pruritus and alopecia,the history and clinical examination may
suggest the most likely diagnosis in an animal with a scaling disorder. If this is the case,
focused diagnostic tests can be performed to confirm the clinical suspicion.However,due
to overlap between the clinical presentations of the diseases described above,it is often nec-
essary to formulate a list of prioritised differential diagnoses.It is important when doing this
not to assume that a particularbreed is sufferingfrom a primary scalingdisorder.Although
the breed may suggest that a primary scaling disorder is included on the differential dia-
gnosis list,it does not preclude the possibility that the animal has another disease that is
leading to secondary scaling.Hence,the golden rule when approaching this problem is to
always consider the possibility of secondary causes before assuming an animal has a
primary scalingdisorder.
Figure 6.1 shows a diagnostic algorithm forscaling disorders.When using this algorithm,
the clinician should useinformation obtainedfrom thehistory and clinical examination to
determine if all the steps are appropriate fora particular case.For example,it would not be
necessary to rule out demodicosis or cheyletiellosis in a dog suffering only from footpad
hyperkeratosis.It can be seenfrom this flow chart that skinbiopsy isavery valuable tool
whenassessing scaling.Histopathologicalexamination is the only way to definitively-
diagnose many of the diseases described in this chapter.

Macular,papularandpustulardiseases
Differentialdiagnosis
Macules are circular,flat areas of abnormally coloured skin,up to 1 cm in diameter.As
described inChapter 2,maculesmayoccur due toerythema,haemorrhage orchanges in skin
pigmentation (hyperpigmented or hypopigmented macules).This chapter is concerned with
erythematousandhaemorrhagicmacules.Maculesassociatedwith abnormalpigmentation
will bediscussed inChapter10.
Papules and pustules are small red spots. Pustules contain visible pus whereas papules
do not.Papules and pustules often become crusted because exudate is deposited on the skin
surface and becomes enmeshedwithin the stratum corneum.Papules and pustules may
also result in circumferentially spreading circular lesions surrounded by a rim of scale
(epidermal collarettes).
In somediseasessuchasstaphylococcalpyodermamacules,papules and pustulescanoccur
together on the same animal because they represent a pathological continuum.In other dis-
eases.one type oflesion may predominate.In either case,the animal has visible skin lesions
that will appear as a rash.It is important that the clinician assesses these rashes carefully to
identify the precise identity ofthelesions because this has diagnostic significance.Tables 7.1,
7.2 and 7.3 show the differential diagnoses for macular,papularand pustulareruptions.
Clinicalfeaturesofmacular,papularandpustulareruptions
Some of the most common causes of these eruptions arepruritic.Hence,the clinical features
offleabitehypersensitivity,flybitehypersensitivity,Sarcoptesscabiei infestation,staphylo-
coccalpyoderma,contact dermatitis and miliary dermatitis are all described in Chapter 4.
Demodicosis isdescribed in Chapter 5because this usuallypresentswith alopecia.However,

Generaldiagnosticapproachtomacular,papularandpustulardiseases
Whenpresentedwith these typesof cutaneous eruptions,it is critical that theclinician care-
fully assesses the nature and type of skin lesions.Often,the animal may appear tobe cov-
eredin crustsor scalypatchesof alopecia and it iseasy tobe side-tracked into considering
other differential diagnoses.The clinicianmust look extremely carefully for the primary
lesions and use them forfurtherinvestigation.
Aswithother cutaneousproblems,thehistory and clinical appearancemaybesuggestive
ofaparticular disease.For experiencedclinicians orveterinary dermatologists,thismay be
possible even with quiterare diseases such aspemphigus foliaceus.However,if theclini-
cian is unsure as to themost likely diagnosis,a logical diagnostic approach isrequired so
thatpossible causesarenotmissed.
The clinician should first determine if thelesions arepurelymacular,papular,pustular
orifamixture of lesions ispresent.Figures7.1,7.2and7.3provide diagnostic algorithms

Drainingtractsandnon-healingwounds
Differentialdiagnosis
Draining（sinus)tractsareopeningsbetween theunderlyingdermisorsubcutisand theskin
surfacethroughwhichexudate isdischarging.Drainingtractsusuallyimply thepresence of
an infectious agent,either bacterial or fungal.Inmostcases,identification and elimination
of the organism will lead toresolution of theskin disease.Draining tractscan alsobe seen
inassociation with demodicosis(Chapter 5),but only when furunculosis and secondary
infection have occurred.In some cases,draining tractsfail torespond toroutine antimicro-
bial therapy.In this chapter,these persistent,non-responsive lesions will be described as
non-healingwounds,although theremaybenohistoryofan actual traumaticwoundatthe
onset of the condition.In rare cases,discharging sinuses can be sterile and result from
immune-mediated diseases.Table 8.1 shows themajor differential diagnoses for draining
tracts in dogs and cats.

Generaldiagnosticapproachtodraining tractsandnon-healingwounds
When confrontedwith an animal with drainingtracts or non-healingwounds,theclinician
should always be aware of thepossibilityofa zoonotic infection.Mycobacterial infections,
sporotrichosis,and blastomycosis can lead to severe infections in people.As a precaution,
clinicians should wear gloves when examining animalswith draining tracts and beextra
cautious when performingdiagnostic testswith scalpel blades andneedles.
The most important clinical objective when presented with draining tracts is to deter-
mine if an infectious agent is present,and if so,what type. Some conditions such as cat
bite abscesses are so common that an initial diagnosis can be made clinically. In other
cases, diagnostic tests are mandatory before a diagnosis can be made.These cases may
require specialised culture techniques to identify some of the infectious agents described in
this chapter.
The basic diagnostic approach to draining tracts and non-healing wounds is described in
Figure 8.1.

Erosiveandulcerativediseases
Differentialdiagnosis
Erosionsand ulcersare caused by diseases thatdamage the epidermis,dermo-epidermal
junctionorunderlying dermis(traumaautoimmune and immune-mediated diseases,deep
infections,neoplasia,burns,congenital diseases).Some of these conditions are common
whereasothersareextremelyrare.
When investigating thepossible causes of erosionsand ulcers,it is useful to divide the
differential diagnoses into categories based on their presenting patterns.Table 9.1 divides
these distribution patterns into three groups:diseases causing focal areas of ulceration;dis-
easescausingulcerationof thenasalplanum andface;anddiseasescausingulceration of
mucocutaneousjunctionsorgeneralised lesions.

phoma may present asa pruritic skin disease as described in Chapter 4,but alopecia and
scaling（Chapters5and6),depigmentation(Chapter10),cutaneousnodules(Chapter11）or
ulceration can all occur.Deep bacterial infectionsusually lead to draining tracts (Chapter 8)
butulceration may be a feature,especially in the German shepherd dog.Feline cowpox
virus infection has been described in Chapter 7as a papular disease but is listed here
because the lesionscan become ulcerated in somecases.

Ulcerative diseases can be severe and,in some cases,life-threatening. Hence,when pre-
sented with ulcerative lesions.it is critical that the clinician makes a swift and accurate
diagnosis.There is no place for a protracted course of investigation that may be appropriate
for some other presenting problems such as pruritus or scaling.Figure 9.1 shows a diag-
nostic algorithm that can be used to investigate cases of cutaneous ulceration.

Pigmentarychanges
Differential diagnosis
Pigmentation changes in the skin canbe divided into those conditions that cause hyper-
pigmentation(Table 10.1) and those that cause hypopigmentation(Table10.2).
Hyperpigmentationisseenmostcommonlyfollowingskin inflammation andwithhor-
monal dermatoses.With these conditions,other presentingproblems such as pruritus or
alopecia areusuallypresentconcurrently.
Hypopigmentation canbe causedby a congenital lack of melanin or diseases that lead to

Clinical featuresofskindiseasespresentingwithhyperpigmentation
Hyperpigmentation is usually caused by increasedmelanin pigment in the epidermislead-
ing toa blackor blackish-brown discoloration of the skin.Thiskind of hyperpigmentation
is seen with most of the diseaseslisted in Table 10.1.Demodicosis leads toincreased
melanin in the dermis and causesa slate-grey hyperpigmentation.
The conditionscausingpost-inflammatory and hormonal hyperpigmentation havebeen
describedin Chapters4and5of thisbookbecause thesediseaseshavemoreobviouspre-
sentingsignssuch aspruritus oralopecia.Testicularneoplasia maylead to diffuse hyper-
pigmentationof theventrum andperineum in conjunctionwith alopecia（seeChapter5)but

Clinicalfeaturesofskindiseasespresentingwithhypopigmentation
Hypopigmentation can affect the skin (leukoderma), the hair(leukotrichia)or both.This is
commonlyseen as a naturalageingprocess in dogsand ismanifested bygreying of thehair
aroundthemuzzle.This acquiredleukotrichia is due to an age-relatedreduction in the
number of cutaneous melanocytes. Hypopigmentation may also be seen in a number of dis-
ease states.For hypopigmentation to occur, there has to be an abnormality in melanin
synthesis or abnormal/damaged melanocytes. In some of the diseases that cause hypopig-
mentation,themelanocytes are caught up in another disease process and hypopigmentation
is not the only presenting sign.For example,in lupus (described in Chapter 8)and pem-
phigus (described in Chapter 7),the melanocytes are damaged by inflammation that targets
the dermo-epidermal junction or epidermis.In leishmaniasis (Chapter 6).themelanocytes
are damaged by infection of the epidermis withprotozoal organisms whereas in epithe-
liotropic lymphoma (Chapter 4).the infiltrating lymphocytes damage keratinocytes and
melanocytes concurrently.Zinc is required for normal melanin synthesis and zinc defi-
ciency (described in Chapter 6) can lead to hypopigmentation in some cases.In all these
cases,it is unlikely that the animal will be presented for hypopigmentation alone.The dia-
gnosisshould thereforebemade byinvestigating the otherpresentingproblemsas described
in earlier chapters.This chapterwill describe the diseases in which hypopigmentation is the
cardinal presenting sign.

Generaldiagnosticapproachtopigmentarychanges
When animals are presented with hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation it is important
todetermine if other clinical signs are also present.If the flowchart described in Chapter 3
is followed,most cases of pigmentation change will beinvestigated for other problems first.
However,in certain cases,the clinician maybe faced with the investigation of pigmentary
abnormalities as the primary presenting problem.The flowcharts shown inFigures 10.1 and

Differentialdiagnosis
Cutaneous lumps and swellings are a common presenting sign in general practice. They are
a sourceof greatanxiety to ownersbecause they areeithervisibleorpalpable,andmaybe
due to neoplasia.Hence,when presented with sucha problem,the clinician's role is to
rapidly determine an accurate diagnosis andprognosis.Table 11.1 shows the possible
causes of cutaneous swellings in dogs and cats based on the type of material that is found
within them.This approachis useful because determining thecontents ofalumpispivotal

It is not the intention of this chapter to provide detailed information about every skin

Generaldiagnosticapproachtolumpsandswellings
Aswith otherdermatologicalproblems,theinvestigationofa lump orswellingshouldbegin
witha thoroughhistory andphysical examination.Thismayreveal evidence of trauma or
bite wounds that could have caused haematomas or abscesses.It is also important to deter-
mine howrapidly a lump appeared,how long it has been there and whether it is increasing
in size.A full dermatological examination shouldbeperformed tocheckfor thepresence of
otherlumpselsewhere.It isnotuncommonfor animalstobepresentedfor examination of
a singlelumpwhenmultiple lumps canbe found.Thelump itself should thenbe carefully
examined.Visual inspection determines the appearance, size, shape,and the presence of
any discharging sinuses orulceration.Palpation determines the consistency,firmness,depth
and attachment tounderlyingtissues.
In some cases,the history and clinical examination of a lump or swelling can be very
suggestive of the diagnosis. Examples where this is possible include aural haematomas,
urticaria,angioedema,seromas,cat bite abscesses,calcinosis cutis,sebaceous adenomas,
perianal adenomas and histiocytomas.In most other cases,the clinical appearance is not

pathognomonic and accurate diagnosis and prognosis relies on diagnostic tests. It is not
possible to determine what a lump is,or if it is benign or malignant,by observation and pal-
pation. It is therefore not appropriate for a clinician to feel a lump and tell a client to keep
an eye on it to see if it grows.
Unless a specific diagnosis has been madebased on the history and physical examination
alone,the clinician should perform a fine needle aspirate.The initial goal of this technique
is to determine the predominant cellular content (see Table 11.1).This may provide a defin-
itive diagnosis, a suspected diagnosis or no diagnosis.Fine needle aspiration cytology can
provide a definitive diagnosis for abscesses,cysts,lipomas, sebaceous gland adenomas and
mast cell tumours.Fortunately,these are the most common causes of cutaneous lumps seen
in general practice.Fine needle aspirates may also enable a tumour type to be categorised
as epithelial,spindle,round cell or melanocytic.Although this is useful information,a
biopsy of themass or thewholemassshouldbe submitted forhistopathological analysis to
allow more specific differentiation.
In some cases,fine needle aspiration may be totally unrewarding.In these cases,it is
gnosis.Details on performing fine needle aspirates and skin biopsies are described in
Chapter 13.

Otitisisinflammationof theearcanal.Otitismayberestricted to thevertical and horizontal
ear canals(otitis externa)or it may affect themiddle ear cavity(otitis media).Thisusually
occurswhen infection spreads through the tympanicmembrane into the tympanic bullae.
Otitisinternareferstoinflammation thathasreached thecochleaorsemicircularcanals.
Otitis externa is avery common presenting problem in dogsbut less common in cats.The
usual clinical signsareauralpruritus,auralpain,head shaking,malodourand thepresence
ofavisible discharge.The clinical signsofotitismedia areidentical to thoseofotitisexterna
but they tend tobemore persistent andrecurrent.In addition,hearingmaybe impaired due
to damage of the tympanicmembrane andossicles.Theclinical signsofotitisinterna are
rare and includedeafness andvestibular disease(head tilt,nystagmus,ataxia).
In themajorityofcasesofotitisexterna andmedia,thevisibledischarge isdue toabac
terialoryeastinfection.BacteriacommonlyassociatedwithotitisincludeStaphylococcus
intermedius,Streptococcus canis,Proteus spp.,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella spp.and
Pseudomonasqeruginosa.Malasseziapachydermatisis themostcommonyeastthatcon-
tributes tootitis.Bacterial infections tend toproduce ayellow orgreen purulent discharge
whereasyeast infections tend toproduce a greasy,brownish,waxy discharge.
Aswithother typesof skininfection,earinfectionsusually occursecondaryto anunder-
lying cause.Hence,when presented with a case of otitis,the clinician should always
attempttodeterminewhathaslead to theinfectionaswell as treatingthe infectionitself.

General diagnosticapproachtootitis
Aswith otherdermatologicalproblems,afull history andphysical examination isrequired
when investigating cases of otitis.This is to ensure that potential underlying causes are not
missedat the outset.In addition,an otoscopicexamination must beperformed.The aim
of the otoscopic examinationis todetect foreignbodiesor earmites,toobserve the con-
ditionof thevertical and horizontalcanals,to check the appearance and integrity of the
tympanicmembrane,and tocharacterise the type ofexudatethatispresent.If the condi-
tion isunilateral,clinicians should alwaysexamine thegoodearfirst.Thisprevents the

In addition to diagnosingand treatingthe otitis itself,theclinicianshould alsocommence
efforts to determine the underlying cause.This is especially important in any case that has
suffered otitis on more than one occasion.If this is not done,many cases will become
chronic.
A summary of the diagnostic approaches to acute otitis (animals presentingfor the first
time)and chronic otitis (animals failing to respond to treatment or suffering multiplebouts
ofotitis)are shown inFigures 12.1 and 12.2 respectively.Further details on the treatment

Usingamicroscope
The microscope is the single most important piece of equipment in the practice laboratory.
Without a good quality microscope,accurate dermatological diagnosis is impossible.A
binocular microscope is required with 4X,10x,40× and 100x lenses. With the 10X eye-
pieces,final magnifications of40x,100x,400× and 1000X are obtained.It is important that
the various settings of the microscope (field diaphragm,condenser focus knob,condenser
centering screws)havebeen set up correctly.If themicroscope hasbeenrecentlypurchased,
it should have been optimally configured by the manufacturer on delivery. If not, it is well
worth having it serviced because,with time,the settings on a microscope tend to change
leading to sub-optimalperformance.
The microscope should beplaced in a fixed location in the laboratory on a bench or table
at a suitable height infront of a comfortable stool or seat.Crouching over the microscope
in a cramped corner of a room doesnot lend itself to slideviewing and can lead to neck
or back discomfort.There should also be space around the microscope to store slides and
immersion oil.
For optimal results,the clinician must prepare good specimens and examine them appro-
priately. With any sample, (e.g. skin scraping, cytological specimen, trichogram), it is
important to use a cover slip.This provides a flat optical surface and greatly enhances the
clarity of the image.For skin scrapings and trichograms,the cover slip is suspended on the
mineral oil within which the sample is contained.For cytological specimens,a drop of
Avtorsko zasciteno gradivo
Small animal dermatology
150
immersionoilshouldbeplacedon theslideso thatitcoversthesample.Thecoverslipcan
then be suspended on top.For permanent mounting and storage of slides,the cover slip can
be placed on a drop of DpXmountant (availablefrom laboratory suppliers).
When viewing slides,it is important that the sample is neither too thick nor spread out
too far over the slide.If too thick,the specimen is difficult to examine and diagnosticfind-
ings can be missed.If spread out too far, the slide takes longer to examine than it should,
reducing working efficiency.With experience,it is possible to judge how much material
should be put on a slide so that it can beproperly examined under the area of a cover slip.
Placing extra material outwith the area of a cover slip is non-productive because it can't be
adequatelyexamined.
When viewing skin scrapings and trichograms,it is useful to increase the contrast by turn-
ing down the condenser.This provides better definition of parasites and hairs against the
pale background.When viewing cytological specimens (or histopathology slides) the con-
denser should be opened to allowasmuch light as possible topass through the slide.This
providesbetter clarity and detail of the stained cells.Thelight setting should bemodified
so that each individual slide is optimally illuminated.
When using the microscope,it is essential that the clinician has a good concept of scale.
This allows the appropriate lens to beused for each sample.Figure 13.1 shows the size of
variousobjectsthatarecommonlyseenduringdermatologicaldiagnosis andthelenses that
should be used to find them.
To ensure optimum performance,it is important that the microscopeiskept clean.After
use each day,the lenses should be cleaned with lens tissue.The oil immersion lens should
be cleaned with alcohol or methylated spirit and then dried.The microscope should then
be covered with a dust cover.
Choosingandusinganexternallaboratory
Some of the testsrequiredfor dermatological diagnosisneed tobeperformed in specialist
laboratories.These include culture and sensitivity testing ofmicroorganisms,endocrine
tests,immunological tests and histopathologicaldiagnosis.Haematological andbiochemical
tests arealsooftenperformedby external laboratories.Mostof thecommerciallaboratories
offering these tests perform them to a high standard.However,some care is warranted in
choosing alaboratory for dermatohistopathology.Theinterpretation of skin pathology has
with a specific interest indermatology.A large number of skin diseases can only be
diagnosed histopathologically and many havebeen described relatively recently.Only der-
matopathologists orpathologistswithaspecificinterest indermatology arelikely tobe
familiar with all these conditions. There are a number of pathologists in the UK,USA.
Canada,Europe and Australiawho offer specialised dermatopathology services.Thebest
way tofind oneis to consult a board-certified or specialistveterinary dermatologist.
Once the appropriate laboratories have been chosen,it is important to maximise the
benefit that canbeobtainedfromthem.Cliniciansmustprovideadequatedocumentation
and samples in order to receive diagnostically accurate results.With objective tests (such as
blood tests and hormone assays),the test result is independent of the animal's history and
clinicalsigns.Withthesetests.onlyalimitedamountofinformationisrequiredbythe
laboratory.However,with other procedures (such as histopathological examination). the
provision of an accurate description of the signalment,history and clinical signs is pivotal
in making a definitive diagnosis.If clinicians do notprovide this information,they cannot
expect toreceive consistently accurateresults.

Clinicians should also ensure that the samples submitted are appropriately collected,
stored,labelledandpackaged.Sufficientmaterial shouldbesubmittedtoallowtherequired

andoften provide freepostage and packagingmaterials.Further information on collecting

Finally,cliniciansshouldalwayscorrelatethetestresultsfromexternallaboratorieswith
the clinical findingsfrom the case.If the results do not fit with what is expected,the clini-
cian should discuss the results with the laboratory.This is especially important with
histopathology in which an incorrect diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment.
Clinicians should never let the results of diagnostic tests erase a previous clinical

suspicion.Accurate dermatological diagnosis relies on a critical level of clinico-
pathologicalcorrelation.
Specificityandsensitivityofdiagnostictests
Whenever a diagnostic test isperformed,either within the practice orby an external labor-
atory.the clinician should be acutely aware of the concepts of specificity and sensitivity.
These statistical parameters give an indication as to how reliable a test is in confirming
or ruling out a particular diagnosis.Unless the clinician bears these concepts in mind
erroneousconclusionswillbe drawnfrom testresults.
The specificity indicates thelikelihood thatapositive test result confirms aparticular dis-
ease.Thesensitivityindicatesthelikelihood thata testwillbepositive if the animalhasthe
disease.Tohelpunderstandtheseconcepts,it isuseful tolook attwosimpleexamples:the
useofradiographytodiagnoseabrokenlegand theuseofrectaltemperaturetodiagnosean
infection.If an X-ray shows a fractured bone,it confirms that theleg is broken.Hence,the
ray is taken of abrokenleg.it will always detect the abnormality.The test is also therefore
100% sensitive.In an ideal world,all diagnostic tests would have 100% specificity and
100%sensitivity.Unfortunately.thisisnot thecase.Ifan animalhasanelevatedrectal tem
perature,it may indicate that the animal has an infection.However,it could also indicate
that the animal was excited,stressed,exercising or suffering from another non-infectious
disease.Hence,the test is not specific 1o0% for infections.In addition,if an animal has an
infection,its rectal temperature may or may not be raised.The test is therefore not 100%
sensitive.
Many other tests,includingthosedescribedin this chapter,lackspecificity or sensitivity
The net result of this is that tests can give false positive or false negative results. If a test is
not 1oo% specific,it will produce false positive results.Hence,even with a positive test
result,clinicians should still consider alternative diagnoses.If a test is not 1o0%sensitive
the test will produce false negative results.The clinician should therefore still consider the
suspected diagnosis andperform additional procedures to rule it out.Thismay include fur-
ther diagnostic tests or trial therapies.
for a particular disease. These figures are often estimates because the real figures are not
known.As a guide to interpreting this information,the following summary will beuseful:
Specificity-100%:
Thepositive test result is diagnostic.The animal has the disease.
Specificity-<100%:
The positive test result is not always diagnostic.The animal may
not have the disease.
Sensitivity-100%:
If the animal has the disease,the test result will alwaysbe positive.
Sensitivity-<10o%:If the animal has the disease,the test result will not always be pos-
itive.The animalmay still have the disease.The disease should be
ruled out using other tests or treatments.

3.Examine the collected material with the naked eye and/or with a magnifying glass.
4.Then,transfer the collected material onto aglass slideeitherby pickingit up onapiece
ofadhesive tape(which is then stuck directly on the slide)orby tipping it into a drop
of oil on the slide (which is then covered with a cover slip).
5.Examine under the low power (4x) objective of the microscope.
Examination
The initial material should be examined for signs of fleas or flea dirt.Fleas are laterally com-
pressed,rapidly moving,wingless insects that jump considerable distances.They need to be
killed in order to examine them microscopically.Flea dirt appears as dark specks of "soot-
like”material.When transferred to a piece of moist cotton wool or gauze,the dark specks
turn a reddish-brown colour,indicating the presence of dried blood.
The material should also be examined for the presence of lice which are visible to the
nakedeye or Cheyletiella miteswhich canbe seenwith a magnifyingglass.Aftertransfer-
ring the material to a glass slide,the specimen can be scanned on lowpower(4x) for flea

Superficial skin scrapings
Superficial skin scrapings are useful for finding surface dwellingmites such as Cheyletiella.
Trombicula,Otodectes andpossiblySarcoptes and Notoedres.
1. The area to be scraped should be free of hair. Clip if necessary. For superficial skin
scrapings,a fairly large area can be sampled (up to 6 cm²).Between two and six separ-
ate areas should be sampled to increase the diagnostic accuracy.
2.Mineral oil (liquid paraffin) is the preferred collection medium because it is possible
toseewhetherthemitesare alive ordead.
3.Place a smallquantity ofmineral oilon the skin surface.
4.Usinga slightlyblunted No.10or20 scalpelblade,scrape thebladerepeatedly across
the skin surface over the entire area to be sampled [do not go deep enough to cause
bleeding).At the culmination of each stroke,rotate the blade up and away from the
skinsurface so that thematerial is collected on thebladerather thanjustbeingpushed

6.Mix the contents evenly so that the material is dispersed throughout the oil.However,
do not spread thematerialover the entire slidebecause it will takelonger toscan under
the microscope.Place a cover slip over the collected material.
7.Examine the slide under the low power objective (4x). Use a bright light source but
turn down the condenser to improve the contrast.All the listed mites can be seen
under this magnification.
Deep skinscrapings
Deep skin scrapings are required for finding follicular parasites such as Demodex mites or
Pelodera nematodes.
1.For deep skin scrapings, a smaller area should be sampled (up to 2 cm²). The mites
should easilybe found in a single sample.However,multiple areas(up to five) should
besampled to determine if the problem isgeneralised.
2.Using a slightly blunted No.10 scalpel blade,scrape the blade repeatedly across the
skin surface over the area tobe sampled.After the first few initial scrapes,squeeze the
skin between thumb and forefinger to express mites from the follicles onto the surface.
Then,continue scraping until capillary oozing is seen (the area should look like an
abrasion).At the culmination of each stroke,rotate the blade up and away from the
skin surface so that thematerial is collected on the bladerather than justbeing pushed
along the skin surface.
3.Transfer the sample from the blade onto a glass slide.This is easier if there is already
a drop of mineral oil in the centre of the slide.Repeat steps 4 and 5 until an adequate
sample hasbeen obtained.Do not collect too much material orit will be too thickwhen
examined under the microscope.
4.Mix the contents evenly so that the material is dispersed throughout the oil.However,
do not spread thematerial overthe entire slidebecause it will takelonger toscan under

Cotton swabs
OFine needle aspiration
Which method is used depends on the type of lesion to be sampled.Dry,greasy, or scaly
lesions are best sampled using clear adhesive tape.Moist lesions,pustules,purulent exu-
dates,or ulcers are best sampled using impression smears. Cotton swabs can be used to
obtain samples from difficult to reach areas such as the ear canals.Fine needle aspiration is
used to obtain samples from solid lesions such as lumps and swellings.
Clearadhesivetape
1.The type of tape used is very important because there is quite marked variation in both
the adhesive properties and the degree of transparency/graininess between brands.
"Cellux”and “Diamond Clear” tape are both useful. If these are not available in a par
ticular area,it is worth experimenting with several different types of tape to find one
that is satisfactory.
2.Cut a piece of tape slightly longer than the length of a glass slide.
3.Press the middle of the tape repeatedly onto the lesional skin surface until it loses its
adhesiveness.This means that it is covered in corneocytes.
4.Stick one end of the tape onto a glass slide to facilitate staining.
Impressionsmears
1.Press a glass slide onto the surface of the lesion or exudate.Do not repeatedlypress the
slideonto thesurfacebecause thesampleobtainedmaybecome too thick.Ifyouwish
to collect progressively deeper samples from the same lesion,move the slide along
each time or use a new slidefor each sample.
2.To sample an intact pustule,rupture the pustule with a needle and then press the slide
onto the surface as above.
3.Air-dry the slide before staining.
Cotton swabs
1.Place the cotton swab into the ear canal and gently remove some of the exudate or wax.
2.Roll the swab over the surface of the slide.Do not rub the swab backwards and for
wards because thiswill disrupt the cellular components.
Fineneedleaspirates
1.Spray orwipe the surface of the masswith
alcohol.Hold themass tofix itsposition
2.Insert a 20-gauge needle attached to a 5ml
syringe.

3.Withdraw the plunger toproduce negative
pressure.
4.Move the needle around a few times,
backwards and forwards,up and down
and side toside.Donotlet theneedle
leave the mass.
5.Release the suction on theplunger
6.Withdraw the syringe and needlefrom
the mass.Then,perform steps 7 to 10
very rapidly(less than 3 seconds)so
that the material does not dry out within
theneedle
7.Remove the needle from the syringe.
8.Fill the syringe with air.
9.Reconnect the needle
10.Forcibly expel the contents onto a glass
slide.Check the slide carefully to see
if there is any material on it (theremay
be a very small amount). Air-dry the
slide in preparation for staining.If the
technique does not work first time,it
shouldbe tried again.If it still doesn't
work,the technique can be tried with a
needle without the syringe attached.The
syringe is then justused to blow the
contents out onto the slide.
Staining and examiningcytology samples
For most routine clinical purposes,the most useful staining system is Diff Quik (Dade). This
comprises a methanol fixative,a red eosin dye and a blue thiazine dye.
Avtorsko zasciteno gradivo
Performing and interpreting diagnostictests
163
1.For general staining.dip the slide or adhesive tape into the fixative five times.Then
dip theslide or tapeinto thered dyefive times followed by theblue dye five times.At
each stage,each dip should last 1 second.
2.Rinse the slide or tape thoroughly with distilled water.
3.If using tape,fold it back over the glass slide (sticky side down).As the sample is pro
tected underneath the tape,the slide may be dried by pressing it between tissue paper.
If usingglass slides,the sample should be air-dried.Donot dry with tissue paper or the
sample may be removed.
4.When dry. adhesive tape strips can be examined immediately.For glass slides,the
sample shouldbe coveredwith a coverslipinorder toimprove theclaritywhen exam
ining under the microscope.Place a drop of immersion oil over the sample and float
the cover slip on top. Adhesive tape acts as its own "cover slip” so an additional cover
slip is not required.
5.Scan the whole slide on low power and look for areas that have stained purple.Then
look at these areas under high power (X400) or oil immersion (X1000).

Interpreting cutaneouscytology
As with the interpretation of any diagnostic test,it is important to know what can be
expected normally before deciding if something is pathological.
Normal cytological findings
Pathological findings
Surface corneocytes,hairsoccasional bacteria
Abnormal or excessive numbers of

Epidermal cells from below the stratum
corneum (acantholytic keratinocytes)
Neoplastic cells or cyst contents
When interpreting cytological preparations,the observer must first distinguish between
those findings that arefound normally and those that represent disease.Then,it should be
determined whether the pathological changes represent inflammation or neoplasia.In

This field contains two neutrophils,a
macrophage and an eosinophil. The
eosinophil is similar inappearance to the
neutrophil but its cytoplasm isfilled with
pinkish-red granules.These can be

with Diff Quik rather than red. Occasional
eosinophils canbe found in any
inflammatory skin disease.
Thisfield contains three eosinophils and a
neutrophil.When eosinophils make up a
significant proportion of the cellular
infiltrate (approaching 50% or more),the
inflammation canbe described as
eosinophilic.This usually indicates either a
parasitic infestation, or in cats,lesions of
the eosinophilicgranuloma complex
(especially the eosinophilic plaque).
This field contains two eosinophils and a

Examination
The hairs should firstbe examined under low power to assess the numbers,orientation and
anyobvious abnormalities thatrequire closer scrutiny.The hairs should thenbe examined
under higher power,starting at the base of the hair and working along the shafts to the
points.The hairs should be assessed for the presence of anagen or telogen bulbs:peri-bulbar
demodex mites; a smooth shaft;eggs attached to the shafts; debris or fungal spores attached
to the shaft;anybreakages in theshafts;the sizeand distribution ofmelaningranuleswithin
the shaft; and thepresence of a taperingpoint.
Thefollowingfigures aidin theinterpretation of trichograms.

Interpretation
Normal anagen hair with smooth edges,a
pigmented medulla,a smooth tapering
point and an anagenbulb.Anagenbulbsare
present on activelygrowinghairs and are
smooth and rounded,oftenhave a
pigmented centre and commonly fold
around theside of thehair shaftwhen
plucked.Thepresence of large numbers of
anagen hairs indicates that active hair
growth is occurring in the area from which
the sample was obtained.
Normal telogen hair with smooth edges,a
smooth tapering point and a telogen bulb.
Telogen bulbs are present on inactive hairs
and are spear-shaped,rough and lacking in
pigment.If all the hairs in the trichogram
havethis appearance,it suggeststhat active
hair growth isnotoccurring in the area
from which the sample was obtained.This

Technique
1.The most reliable method of collecting a sample for fungal culture is to use the tooth-
brush technique.Thisinvolvesbrushing thehaircoat and thelesionsfor1-2minutes
with a new toothbrush.This picks up fungal spores,even if the level of infection is
fairly low.
2.Samples can also be collected by plucking individual hairs.This is less sensitive
because infected hairs might be missed.However,the sensitivity of the whole tech-
nique isincreased by combining bothhair pluckings and toothbrushings.
3.Thebristlesof the toothbrush andthe collectedhairs areused toinoculatethe culture

Bacterial skin infections should be initially assessed on the basis of clinical lesions and

required to make a diagnosis and commence appropriate antibacterial therapy.As these con-
ditions are themost commonbacterial skin infections inthe dog and cat,bacterialculture

2.Intact pustules should be opened with a sterile needle.Pustules should not be cleaned
or disinfected prior to sampling because this can lead tonegativeresults.A sterile cul-
tureswab should be touched against the purulent exudate and then placed in its sterile
container. Culture swabs containing transport medium are preferred for dermatological
use.
3.Draining tracts can be sampled by placing a sterile culture swab deep within the tract.
Exudate that hasbeen on the skin surface for any length of time shouldnot be sampled
because it is likely tobe contaminated.

Positive results canbe obtained with either test in clinically normal dogs and dogs with
other skin diseases. The test result is only meaningful if the dog has clinical signs consis-
tentwith atopic dermatitis and all otherpruritic diseases have been ruled out.
Intradermalskintest
The intradermal skin test is a method for demonstrating thepresence of hypersensitivity to
various environmental allergens based on skin reactivity.

Intradermal skin testing is usually performed atreferral centres or in practices in which
there is a clinician with a specific interest in dermatology. The selection of allergens and
interpretation of intradermal skin tests requires specialised advice and training.Allergen
solutions are also expensive and it would not be cost effective to offer this service unless
one or two tests per week were beingperformed.
Practitioners interested in performing this procedure shouldvisit a specialist veterinary
dermatologist,study for a further qualification in the discipline or undertake residency
training.It is beyond the scope of thisbook toprovide comprehensive details of skin testing
procedures.The intention of this chapter is to provide veterinarians with sufficient back-
ground to themethodology toallow appropriatecaseselection and tobeableto inform
clients about the procedure.
Mostveterinarydermatologists testforreactivity against thefollowingantigens:
House dust mite and storage mite antigens (Dermatophagoides farinae,Der-
matophagoidespteronyssinus,Acarussiro,Tyrophagusputrescantiae,Euroglyphus
maynei).
Human and animal danders(derived from desquamated corneocytes).
House dust (a mixture of dust mite antigens,human and animal danders,bacteria,
fungal spores,and fibres)
Pollens (from trees. weeds and grasses).
Moulds(from thehousehold orfrom crops).
Theinclusionof regionalallergens(pollens)inthe testingkit isbased onknowledge of the
plants in a particular geographical location.In large countries such as the USA,there are dis-
tinct botanical zones that contain species of trees, grasses and weeds not found in other
areas. In smaller countries such as the UK, this is not a major problem.
Indications
Indicated in animalswith a history and clinical signs consistent with atopic dermatitis in
whichallergen immunotherapy is considered the treatment of choice.Should onlybeper-
formed after other pruritic diseases have been ruled out or controlled (ectoparasites,Pyo

of 10-20 μg/kg are the preferred sedatives.Acepromazine (ACP) is not acceptable
because it reduces skin test reactivity.
2.A patch of fur is clipped from the lateral thorax (about 6"× 4"(15 X 10 cm).
3.The injection sites are marked using a black marker pen.
4.Approximately 0.05 ml of each antigen is injected intradermally alongwith the posi-
tive (histamine)and negative (saline) controls (the exact amount is not critical as long
as all the injections are the same size).
5.The reactions are read 10-20 minutes later. These appear as wheals.The positive con-
trolis given a score of 4+and the negative controla score of o.Other reactions are sub
jectivelygradedbetween thesevaluesbasedon thediameterof thewheal,thedegree

6.In some cases, late phase reactions may occur at some sites 24-48 hours later. These
appear as erythematous,indurated areas that may contain a papular eruption.Thefull
significanceofthesereactionsiscurrentlyunknown.Somedermatologistsaskowners
to observe for these reactionswhereas others hospitalise the animaland reassess the
skin test site themselves.
Interpretation
The skin test is interpreted by correlating the positive reactions with the patient's history.

Technique(summarised in Figure 13.2)
1.A blood sample is taken and the serum sent off to a laboratory offering the service.
2.The diluted serum sample is added to a plate containing individual wells coatedwith
specific antigens.The range of antigens is similar to that used for intradermal skin
testing.
3.If there is any IgE in the serum that is specific for a particular antigen,it binds to it
The bound IgE is then detected by adding an enzyme-linked reagent that can bind to
IgE. This is either a monoclonal antibody or a receptor for IgE molecules.
4.A substrate is added that changes colour when it contacts the enzyme attached to the
IgE reagent. The degree of colour change is proportional to the amount of IgE that is
bound,

Unlike many diseases,there areno currently availablelaboratory or clinical tests that can
beused to diagnose food allergy in dogs and cats.Both intra-dermal tests and in-vitro meas-
urement of allergen-specificIgE are regarded as unreliable indicators of food sensitivities
and can not,at present, be recommended for use.Food allergy can only be diagnosed by
properly conducted dietary trials.

Sensitivity

Indications
Should be performed on any dog or cat with a chronic pruritic skin disease after ruling out

Technique
In many textbooks and publications,the diagnosis of food allergy is described as a simple
matter inwhich the animal isplaced on a restricted diettrial to determineif the skin con-
dition resolves.If it does,the animal is placedback onto its original diet and observed for
signs of a recurrence.For many clinicians,this would be diagnostic for food allergy.
Although this is thebasicpremise onwhich food allergies are diagnosed,there are a num-
ber of practical considerations that need tobe addressed if any meaningful information is to
bederivedfrom this commonlyrecommendedprocedure.Before commencinga dietary
trial,the clinician mustknow:
1.Whether torecommend ahome-cooked or commercially available diet.
2.How to prepare and feed a home-cooked diet.
3.What problems might occur withhome-cooked diet trials.
4.How long diet trials should last.
5.How to assess the response to dietary trials.
Decidingonahome-cookedorcommerciallyavailablerestricteddiet
Thefirst dilemma faced by the clinician is to decide whether to recommend ahome-cooked
diettrialoruseacommerciallyavailablelimitedingredient diet.Mostveterinarydermato-
logists would agree thathome-cooked diets arepreferable.The rationale for this isbased on
limited scientific evidence that some dogs and cats(about 2o%) can be maintained on a
home-cookeddietbutshowarecurrenceofsignswhenfedacommerciallyavailablediet
containing the same ingredients.This is thought to be due to the additives that arepresent
in commercial diets （colourings,flavourings,preservatives,vitamins,minerals) that are used
toensure thedietsarenutritionally complete,palatable andresistant tospoilage.Analtern
ativepossibility is that food sources are antigenically changed during the manufacturing
process.Although neither of these possibilitieshave been definitively proven,a home
cooked diet trial is still regarded as the optimal method to definitively rule out food allergy.
This is because if there is no response to the diet(as occurs in the majority of cases),there
isno residual element of doubt that the animal could bereacting to an additional dietary
component.

However,home-cooked diet trials are labour intensive and can cause problems with
owner compliance.They are alsonot suitable for growing animals oranimals already on pre-
scription diets for other purposes.Therefore,if a home-cooked diet trial is not possible,a
commercially availablelimited ingredientdiet trial ispreferable tonotperforming adiet
trial at all.Lists of currently available commercial limited ingredient diets are provided in
Chapter 14under"Treatment of foodallergy"
Preparationandfeedingofhome-cookedrestricteddiets
The usual recommendation for formulatinghome cooked diets is to restrict the animal to
one single protein source,one single carbohydrate source and water.The choice of these
ingredients should bebased on a detailed analysis of the animal'sprevious dietary history.
Typical protein sources include fish (coley. cod, haddock, tuna), pork,rabbit,venison,
turkey or lamb.Owners can purchase these foods fresh from a butcher orfishmonger,or can
obtain them frozen from supermarkets or pet superstores.Beef and chicken are usually
avoided because these are common ingredients in commercial pet foods.Typical carbo-
hydrate sourcesincludepotato,rice or pasta.
Although the individual ingredientsvary in a particular diet,the preparation is fairly
standard.The meat can beboiled,baked ormicrowaved and the carbohydrate can be boiled
as usual.Excess fat should be removed from the meat as this may lead to diarrhoea.The
meat and carbohydrate can then be mixed together in a blender or food processer.This pro-
vides amixture that the animal isunable to separate.The ratio of theprotein source to the
carbohydrate should be about 1:2.The mixed food can then be weighed,placed in bags and
frozenuntilrequired.
The preparation ofhome-cooked diets can be a very time-consumingprocess andrequires
quite large cookingutensils.For small dogs (5-10 kg)and cats,it is just about possible to
prepare the food on a weekly basis using the typical pans and bowls that are found in an
average household.Thisis likely to involve a preparation time of about 2 hours.The food
can thenbestored in thefreezeruntilrequired.However,forlarger dogs,itislikelythatthe
food will need to be prepared on a more regular basis due to limitations of utensil size or
freezer space.This increases the weekly preparation time to between 4 and 6 hours.For
large dogs,the cost of preparinghome-cooked restricted diet trials can be considerable.This
can be minimised by advising the owner to purchase frozen meat minces and frozen fish
fillets that are available in most largesupermarkets.
Owners often ask how much of the home-cooked diet should be fed.Ingeneral terms,
home-cooked diets are nutritionally incomplete and underfeedingismoreofaproblem than
overfeeding.To ensure adequate intake,owners can be advised in one of the following ways:
OFeedan amount according tothe animal'sbodyweight(seeTable13.2)
Start with a quantity about half asmuch again as the animal'snormal commercial
diet.Further increases can be made if the animal appears constantly hungry or
begins to lose weight.It is advisable to weigh animals on a weekly basis throughout
a food trial in order to monitorbody weight.
Some dermatologistsmerelyrecommend that the diet isofferedadlibitum.How-
ever,with home-cooked diets,this is not as easy as pouring extra biscuits out of a
bag and it can also lead to wastage.
Which of thesemethods is advised depends on the clinician and client'spreference.
Table 13.2gives approximate guidelines for feeding home cooked diets.These amounts
may need to be modified in light of the breed,activity level, climate, appetite and weight
changes.Amounts represent daily intake and indicate cooked weights.

Taurinedeficiency in catsis a theoretical concernbut mostveterinary dermatologistsdonot
provide this supplement during the duration of the trial.However,if ahome-cooked diet is
tobe usedbeyond theperiod of the trial,it is essential that it isbalanced with additional
ingredients (see Chapter 14).In addition,home cooked-diets should notbe fed to growing
animals and those with special nutritional needs.
Recommendeddurationofrestricteddiettrials
Thelength of time that a restricted diet needs tobe fed is a controversial area inveterinary
dermatology.In many older publications and standard textbooks,a 3-week trial was advo-
cated.Thiswasbased empirically on anecdotal evidence,clinicians'own experiences and
ageneral feeling that the allergicreaction should subsidewithin this time after the offend-
ing allergens wereremoved.However,more recent studies have suggested that the duration
of therestricted diet trial should be extended to 10 weeks in some cases.These publications
werebased on the observation that up to 7o%of dogs and cats showed noresponse to the
diet trial at 3weeks but showed complete or partial resolution of clinical signs by 6 or 10
weeks.Because of the many problems associated with assessing the response to home-
cooked food trials (see below), some dermatologistshave questioned the validity of this
data.Furthermore,other recent studies have contradicted these findings,suggesting that a
clinicalresponse to diet trials is seen within 3 or 4weeks.It is therefore difficult to make
firm recommendationswhen the literature is replete with such conflicting data.Clearly,the
diet can be challenged as soon as the animal shows a response,even if this is within the first
3weeks.If there has been no response by this time,many dermatologists continue the trial
for afurther 3weeks.Whether thetrialshouldbe continued beyond this time depends on
the compliance of the owner and the index of suspicion of the clinician.
Assessingtheresponsetofood trials
There are many problems and pitfalls in assessing the response to dietary trials.Although
many animals appear to show a response to restricted diets,this does not confirm a dia-
gnosis of food allergy. The clinician needs to take into account all the following factors
before accepting that the diet is playing any role in an animal's skin disease.
Ownercompliance
Asa result of thepractical difficulties associatedwithformulating andfeedinghome-cooked
restricted diet trials, there can be major problems with owner compliance. Some owners
admitbeforehand thatitwill notbepossible toperform thedietasrecommended.Although
this poses further diagnostic dilemmas,it may be anhonest reflection of the owners capa-
bilities and financial situation.Of greater concern are the many clients that agree to perform
the food trial in the consulting room,but then fail to carry it out properlybecause of the
practicalproblems they encounter when attempting it.Even after receiving the client's
assurance that thediethasbeen correctly performed,there is no way of determining.based
on the owner's history alone,that this is the case.The veterinarian must therefore accept
that some cases of food allergymay remain undiagnosed despite extensive dietary trials.
Failuretore-challenge
If an animal appears to have made a spectacular recovery during a restricted diet trial,
some owners are reluctant toput their petback onto its original diet.Whilst it is tempting
to share this view.it is important to insist that the animal is challenged with its previous
food.The main reason for this is that,as with any therapeutic trial in veterinary
Avtorsko zascitenogradivo
194
Small animal dermatology
dermatology,there can be a significant placebo effect (in up to 20% of cases).Hence,a
restricted dietcould be continued for prolongedperiods of timewithoutbeingof anyben-
efit to the patient.This situation can be seen in cases that undergo spontaneous resolution
or those that receive some other concurrent treatment at the time of the trial (anti-para-
siticides or antimicrobial agents). The original diet should therefore be gradually intro-
duced over a 3 to 4 dayperiod and the animal observed for signs of a relapse over the next
7 to 10 days.
Partialorcoincidentalresponses
Partial responses to diet trials may occur in animals that have atopic dermatitis and food
allergy at the same time,but can also occur when another disease undergoes spontaneous
fluctuations in severity (waxing and waning).Based on the currently accepted criteria for
diagnosis of food allergies(response whilst on the restricted diet,relapse on challenge,fol-
lowed by a further response on re-introduction of therestricted diet),it is still possible to
make an erroneous diagnosis of food allergy based solely on coincidence.The only way to
overcome this problem is to repeat the cycle on anumber of occasions until both thevet-
erinarian and the client are totally convinced that the diet is a major factor.However,
repeated cycling is time consumingand causesfurther difficulties with client compliance.
To date,no series of cases reported in the literature has used this approach and demon
strated convincinglong-term follow-updata to fully substantiate thediagnosis of food
allergy in all cases.
Influenceofsecondarybacterialandyeastinfections
A majorproblem encounteredwhen assessingdietary trials is the development and control
of secondary infections such as staphylococcalpyoderma and Malassezia dermatitis.These
infections are common in dogswith cutaneoushypersensitivities and specific treatment for
them is often prescribed at the same time as the restricted diet trial.When the animalreturns
for re-examination,there may have been a dramatic response and a significant or complete
reduction in pruritus.It is critical when faced with this situation that the antimicrobial ther-
apies are continued throughout the challenge phase of the diet trial. If they are not,it is
likely that the secondary infections will recur and give the impression that the dog has
relapsed on reintroduction of the normal diet,again leading to an erroneous diagnosis of
food allergy.
Concurrentanti-pruritictherapy
The use of anti-pruritic therapy such as glucocorticoids at the same time as the food trial can
cocorticoids are used only when absolutelynecessary (for example,in dogs or cats that are
so pruritic that they are self-mutilating themselves).In this case,the glucocorticoids must
be given orally and for the shortest possible time(1-3weeks).They must then bewithdrawn
completelyso that the effects of thediet trial canbe assessed.
Provocativetesting
If.despite all the difficulties outlined above,the clinician makes a definitive diagnosis of
food allergy.it is desirable to determine the specific antigens the animal is reacting to.This
Can be achieved by provocative testing. This is a series of sequential dietary challenges in
which theanimalis fed additional singleprotein and carbohydrate sources.Tobegin with,
the animal is placed on therestricted diet until maximal improvement has been noted.
Then,an additional single protein or carbohydrate source is added to the dietfor 7 to10
Avtorskozascitenogradivo
Performing and interpretingdiagnostictests
195
days.If there is no relapse,a second protein or carbohydrate source is added instead of the
first one for a further 7 to 10 days.This cycle is repeated until the animal has been exposed
to beef,chicken,pork,lamb,turkey,fish,egg.milk,bread,potato and rice.Ifat any stage,
the animal has a relapse,it must be placedback onto the restricted diet until maximal
improvement has occurred again.The sequential challenge can then proceed in order to
determine if any other sensitivities are present.This process provides the clinician and
owner with information thatallows thelong-term dietarymanagementof the animal tobe
accuratelyplanned.However,it takesahighly committed andmotivatedowner tofollow
these guidelines correctly and return meaningful information.Many clients are simply
happy to maintain therestricted dietorattempt tofind a commercially available diet that
the animal can tolerate.
Details on thelong-term management of confirmed cases of food allergy are provided in
Chapter 14.

can be applied as their normal formulations.Powders canbe mixed with petroleum
jelly.Floor cleaners and disinfectants can be applied at their normal working dilutions.
4.The sites are monitored daily for signs of erythema,oedema and pruritus.
5.Suspectedpositive reactions should be biopsied.
Interpretation
Openpatch testinghasnotbeen standardised and there arenosuitablepositive ornegative
controls.Hence,it isnotknown what concentrations of substances should be applied.The
applied substancescanlead toirritantreactions that arenotrelevant to the animal'sskindis-
ease.Hence the reactions can be totally non-specific.Furthermore,if the concentration of
applied substance is too low,a false negative result may occur indicating poor sensitivity. In
view of theseproblems,openpatch testingcannotbe currentlyrecommended.
Closed patchtesting
A method for investigating contact dermatitis by applying certain items or substances to the
skin.
Technique
Relatively difficult and infrequentlyperformed
Interpretation Very difficult,with numerous pitfalls
Specificity
0-100% (an irritant reaction may occur to something that is not the cause
of the animal's dermatosis).
Sensitivity
Indications
Should onlybe performed in cases with ahistory andlesions consistentwith contact
dermatitis in whicha tentative diagnosis has been made by environmental restriction.
Technique
1.A patch of skinis clippedover thelateral thorax.
2.Suspected substances are applied either directly to the skin(solid material like carpets)
or in small metallic cups known as Finn chambers (materials suspended in petroleum
jelly or othervehicles).Commercially availablepatch testingkits are used inhumans
and contain a widevariety of potentially allergenic substances suspended in appro-
priate vehicles.These kits have not been validated for use in dogs and their specificity
andsensitivity arenotknown.
3.The materials and Finn chambers are attached to the skin using adhesive tape and
covered with a bodybandage toprevent self-trauma.
4. The animal should be hospitalised to prevent self-trauma. The test materials are
removed after 48hours and the test sites monitored for the next 2 to 4 days.Positive
reactions aremanifested by areas ofpapular erythema and induration restricted to the
sites that a particular material was applied.
5.Suspected positive reactions should be biopsied.Ideally.the offending substance
should alsobe tested on a normalanimal to ensure that it is not irritant.
Interpretation
Interpretation ofpatch testing isnotoriouslydificult and it canbe plagued by falsepositive
and false negative reactions.The body bandage can be dislodged by the animal and the test
sites can be traumatised. The appropriate substances may not be applied, or if they are, in

5. The biopsy should be gently cleaned by
rolling it on a swab to remove artefactual
haemorrhage. The biopsy is then placed on
a square of cardboard, dermis side down.
This is critical if the biopsy is to be
correctly oriented (see below). The biopsy
site should then be closed using a simple
interrupted or cruciate suture.
6.If larger or deeper biopsies are
required (such as for lump removal
or collection of material fromthe
subcutis for tissue culture),a wedge
or ellipse of tissue can be removed
using a normal scalpel blade.
Orientation of skinbiopsies
1.Regardless of the care taken to select and
obtain skin biopsies, good results will not
be obtained if the samples are not correctly
oriented. The way a skin biopsy is oriented
can mean the difference between a
diagnostic and a non-diagnostic sample,
Orientation is important because the
pathologist has to convert a three
dimensional specimen into a microscopic,
two dimensional sheet. The pathologist
achieves this by first cutting thebiopsy
specimen in half and then taking thin
sections off the flat surface with a
microtome. The clinician can ensure that
this section is taken in an optimal plane by
drawing an arrow (in pencil) on the
cardboard on which the biopsy is mounted.
2. In most cases, the correct orientation is
provided if the arrow is drawn in the
direction of the hair growth.When the
pathologist cuts the biopsy in this
direction,the resulting section will show
the hair follicles in longitudinal section.
This allows the pathologist to examine the
hair follicles in detail and the epithelium
that surrounds them.
Performing and interpreting diagnostic tests
203
3. If the arrow is drawn perpendicular to
the direction of hair growth,theresulting
section will show thehair follicles in cross
 0 
section.This prevents an accurate
examination of thehair follicles and
reduces the amount of epithelium that can
be examined.For many diseases,this
would prevent a diagnosisfrombeing
made.Unfortunately,after the specimen has
been fixed,it isvirtually impossible for the
pathologist toseehow thebiopsyshouldbe
cut.If the clinician hasn't oriented the
specimen, the sectioning is left to chance.
4.The only time that specimens are not
oriented in the direction of hair growth'is
when a biopsyhas been taken at the
junctionbetweennormalandaffectedskin.
In this case,the arrow should show the
direction that will result in a section
showingthe transitionbetween thenormal
and affected areas.
5.If the clinician does not indicate this
orientation with an arrow,the pathologist
willnotbe able to determine the correct
section to take.Afterfixation,the biopsy
loses itscolour andwhat appeared tohave
been an obvious junction initially will have
completely disappeared.If the cut is then
made in the oppositeplane,a section of
normal skin maybe obtained.
Fixation
After collection and orientation,the biopsy should be left sitting on the square of cardboard
for approximately 1 minute so that it becomes firmly attached.The biopsy can then be
placed in a container of 1o%neutralbuffered formalin.Inthe vastmajorityof cases,the
biopsywill remain attached to the cardboard until it reaches thepathologist.
Interpretationofbiopsyresults
The interpretation of skinbiopsies is usuallyprovided in awrittenreport from a pathologist.
Ahistopathologyreport should contain thefollowingsections:
A histological description
A morphological diagnosis
●An aetiological diagnosis if possible
A comments section
The histological description describes what the pathologist actually sees on the slide.In
most cases,the description will describe the stratum corneum and epidermis first,followed
by the dermis and the pattern of inflammatory cell infiltrate,and endingwith the hair

follicles and adnexae (sweat and sebaceous glands). In some cases,if there is a strikingly

systematic approach described above.Thehistological description will contain a variety of

findings.
described in the histological description.This diagnosis will be something similar to
"hyperplastic perivascular dermatitis with marked parakeratosis".Again,without der-
matopathological training.this part of the report will not be of great meaning to the
clinician.
An aetiological diagnosis can beprovided if the histological features are characteristic of
a particular disease.In the above example,the aetiological diagnosis may state “the changes
are consistent with a diagnosis of zinc responsive dermatosis".If this is not possible, the
pathologist will provide a list of differential diagnoses in the comments section.This sec-
tionmayalsocontainotherinformationsuchastherecommendation toperformfurther
tests such as tissue cultures.
When reading the pathology report,it is important that the clinician correlates the in-
formation and the diagnosiswith the clinical picture.This is known as clinico-pathological
correlation.The clinician should neverblindly accept the diagnosis that iswritten on the
report.The pathologist has only seen one tiny section of the animal at one point in time
whereas the clinicianhas access tothewhole animal over a series ofvisits.It isthe clini-
cian that makes the diagnosis,not the pathologist.If the clinician feels that the pathological
diagnosis does not fit with the clinical picture,the clinician and pathologist should discuss
thefindings to try and determine an explanation.If there is still a discrepancy.ora diagnosis
cannot bemade，further biopsiesmaybeindicated toallowexamination of additional
samples.

Table 13.3shows the parameters thatusually appear in a haematologyprofile(CBC).In addi-
tion to thesevalues.a haematology report will normally include comments about the
appearance of the cells.In some laboratories,abnormalvalueswill be indicatedwith an
asteriskor similarmark.However,clinicians should always examine all theparameters
carefully. Clinicians should alsobe aware thatvaluescanbe outside thenormal range in
approximately5%ofhealthyanimals.
Haematologyprofilesare interpretedby determining if thevalues areinthenormal range,
elevated or decreased.The significance of thevarious changescan then be assessed.

Teststoassessthyroidfunction
The assessment of thyroid function is based on the measurement of various thyroid gland
related hormones.These include thyroxine(T4),tri-iodothyronine(T3),free T4,and thyroid
stimulatinghormone(TSH).These hormones are normally measured asbasal concentrations
in the serum but T4 can be measured before and after stimulation of the thyroid gland.In
somecircumstances,themeasurementofautoantibodiesdirectedagainstT3andT4isalso

The significance of a low T4 concentration depends on the actual value and the pres-
ence or absence of other supportive evidence.The examples shown in Table 13.6 will
help to illustrate this principle.Note that asmore evidence isgathered,thelikelihood
of the test diagnosing hypothyroidism increases (i.e. the specificity increases). This prin-
ciple should still be followed ifverylow total T4 concentrations are obtainedbecause
these may result from severe euthyroid sick syndrome.If the clinician is unable to
obtain sufficient evidencetomakea definitive diagnosis ofhypothyroidismbased on
the measurement of total T4 and other clinical information,additional tests should be
performed.These may includemeasurement of TSH concentrations or theTSH stimu-
lation test.
Clinicians should also be careful when normal T4 values are obtained in suspected cases
ofhypothyroidism.This can occur in the early stages of the disease when thyroxine con-
centrations are fluctuating into and out of thenormal range.In this case,further function
tests are indicated.
MeasurementoffreeT4concentrations
FreeT4 is the metabolically active fraction of T4.As free T4 is non-protein bound,it is less
affected by diseases or drugs that affect plasma proteins.However, despite this theoretical
advantage,there does not currently appear tobe a clear diagnosticbenefit in measuringfree
T4 as compared to total T4.

Technique

Interpretation
The normal range for TSH is shown in Table 13.5. In primary hypothyroidism,TSH con-
centrations are usually elevated to above 1.0 ng/ml because the pituitary gland is trying to
increase thyroid hormone production from the failing thyroid glands.Hence a high TSH
concentration in association with alowT4orfreeT4 concentration is suggestive of hypothy-
roidism.However,clinicians should be aware that this combination of changes can still be
seen with euthyroid sick syndrome.Therefore,the diagnosis of hypothyroidism should still
be based on the principles outlined in Table 13.6,with the TSH concentration being
regarded as an additional piece of evidence.

gland function.

217
Sensitivity
98%(currently the most sensitive test for hypothyroidism,but may be

Indications
TheTSH stimulation test can beused as a primary screening test for hypothyroidism.When
used in this way,the test is indicated in dogs presentingwith the following:
Clinical signs consistent with hypothyroidism
Persistent,non-pruritic,symmetrical alopecia
Unexplained dull coat
Persistent seborrhoea
Recurrent pyoderma
OAdultonsetdemodicosis
Persistent lethargy.
However,TSHis not routinely available and it can bedifficult locating a commercially avail-
able sourcefor diagnostic testing.Some endocrinelaboratorieshave access toTSH and will
supply it to clinicians wishing toperform this test.Alternatively,many University hospitals
and speciality practiceswillperform TSH stimulation tests onreferred cases.
Inviewof these difficulties,theTSH stimulation test isprobablybestreserved forcases
in which a diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of history,clinical signs,haematological
and biochemical changes,and total T4 and TSH concentrations (see Table 13.6).It should
be noted that if these principles are applied,the use of the TSH stimulation test is rarely
required.
Technique
1.Collect a blood sample into a plain or heparinised tube.
2.Inject 0.1 IU/kgbovine TSH intravenously.
3.Collect a secondblood sample 6hourslater.
4.The totalT4concentration ismeasured inboth samples
5.IfaTSH stimulation test isrequired ina dog that is alreadyreceivingthyroidhormone
supplementation (to investigate a suspected incorrect diagnosis),the drug should be
discontinued for 8weeks to allow the suppressed thyroidglands torecover.
Interpretation
Although theTSH stimulation testis currentlythemostreliablemethod for assessingthy
roid gland function,the interpretation of theresultsrequires some caution.Most endocrine
laboratorieswill provide their own guidelines forinterpreting the test,but the following
guidelines shouldbe useful to clinicians when analysing theseresults.
Theresults of theTSH stimulation test are interpretedby comparing theT4 concentration
inthe second samplewith thatin thefirst.Anormal thyroidglandwill respond to the TSH
bysecretingT4during the6hourperiodbetweenthe twoblood samples.Withnormal thy-
roidfunction,theconcentrationin thesecond sampleshouldbe atleast 1.5 times thatof the
firstsample andbe above35nmol/l.However,some care iswarrantedwhen applying this
rule.The following graphs illustratevarious results that can be obtained with the TSH stim-
ulation test,and their interpretation.The shaded areas represent the normal range for T4
concentrations in the dog.

Interpretation
The T4 concentration has increased from
20 nmol/l to 40 nmol/1. This indicates

Time (houns)
The T4 concentration has increased from
7 nmol/l to 38 nmol/l.This indicates
normal thyroid gland function.In this case,
the initiallylowT4concentrationmust

Tme (hours)
The T4 concentrationhas increasedfrom
5 nmol/1 to10 nmol/l.Although the T4
concentrationhas doubled,it hasn't
reached 35nmol/1. In conjunction with
appropriate clinical signs,this is diagnostic
forhypothyroidism and thyroid
supplementation is indicated.
The T4 concentration has increased from
5 nmol/l to 22 nmol/l.In this case the T4
concentration has increased more than 4
times but it hasn't reached 35 nmol/l.
Althoughthisresultwouldnormally

shouldbesubstantiatedbyfurther clinical
and biochemical evidence.If therapy is

In this case,the T4concentration has

According to thenormal criteria for
assessing the test,this dog would be
hypothyroid because the second value isn't
1.5 times greater than the first.However,
this dogisvery unlikely tobehypothyroid
because bothvalues arewell in thenormal
range.If the clinical signs are strongly
suggestive of hypothyroidism,a blood
sampleshouldbe submittedfor

TheTRH stimulation test
The TRH stimulation test works by stimulating TSH release from the pituitary gland.This
then stimulates the release of T4from the thyroidglandswhich canbe measured.However,
the increases seen with the TRH stimulation test are less than those seen withthe TSH
stimulation test and it is thereforelessreliable.

1.Collect a blood sample into aheparinised tube.
2.There are two main methods for stimulation.
i）Inject 0.25 mg synthetic ACTH (Synacthen,Ciba Laboratories)intravenously
(regardless ofbody weight).Alternatively,someauthors haverecommended a dose
of 0.1 mg ACTH for dogs less than 10 kg and 0.2 mg for dogs greater than 10 kg.
ii)ORInject 2.2IU/kgACTHgelintramuscularly.
3.Collect a second blood sample 2 hours later.
4.The cortisol concentration is measured inboth samples
5.If an ACTH stimulation test isrequired in a dog that is already receivingprednisolone
the drug should be discontinuedfor48hours ifpossible so that it does not cross react
with the assay (care should be taken not to induce an Addisonian crisis).
Interpretation
Theresults of the ACTH stimulation test are interpreted by comparing the cortisol concen-
tration in the second sample with that in the first.A normal adrenal gland will respond to
theACTH by secretingcortisol duringthe 2hourperiod between the twoblood samples.
This usually results in a 2-3 fold increase in cortisol concentrations. However, in hyper-
adrenocorticism,this response should be exaggerated.In dogs receiving excessive gluco-
corticoids,the concentration in the second sampleis usually the same as thatof the first
sample due to the adrenalgland suppression.
The rangesfor cortisol concentrations before and afterACTH stimulation are shown for
various conditions inTable13.7.As with other sections in this chapter,these ranges are only
provided as a guide and clinicians should always consult the values provided by their own
laboratory.

The ACTH stimulation test versus thelow dose dexamethasone suppression test-which
is best?
Cliniciansand students often enquirewhich of these two tests is thebest.Theansweris that
neither test is completely superior to the other.The ACTH stimulation test isquicker toper-
form and is slightlymore specific than the low dose dexamethasone suppression test.It is
also the test of choice for iatrogenic hyperglucocorticoidism.A further advantage is that it
providesabaseline for subsequent monitoring of treatment.However,thelowdosedexam-
ethasone suppression test is more sensitive and is less likely to miss the diagnosis.There is
also a 30% chance that the low dose dexamethasone suppression test will distinguish
between pituitary and adrenal forms of hyperadrenocorticism (see the first graph above).
Hence, both tests have their advantages and clinicians must decide for themselves which
test to choose first.Regardless of this choice, some cases will require both tests in order to
confirm the diagnosis.
Thehighdosedexamethasonesuppressiontest
Thehigh dose dexamethasone suppression test is based on the same principles as the low
dose dexamethasone suppression test.However,by using a higher dose of dexamethasone,
it ispossible to suppress cortisol secretion in themajority of cases ofpituitarydependant
hyperadrenocorticism.This does not occur with adrenal tumours.Hence,the high dose
dexamethasone suppression testis used to differentiatebetweenthe two causes.

Indications
The use of diagnostic imaging techniques in the investigation of hyperadrenocorticism
varies between institutions.Although widely available,abdominal radiography is notvery
sensitive at detecting adrenal masses.It should therefore be reserved for cases in which
diagnosis is proving dificult.Abdominal ultrasonography is very useful for detecting uni-
lateral or bilateral enlargement of the adrenalglands,but it requires a skilled ultrasono-
grapher. However, it can play an important role in the differentiation of the two causes,
especially if diagnosis is proving a problem.The access to CT and MRI scans is limited at
present although they are becoming more widely available.These modalities can provide
images of both the adrenals and the pituitary gland.Imaging the pituitary gland is most
appropriate in dogs that are also displaying neurological signs.These techniquesmay play
an increasingly important role in theinvestigation of hyperadrenocorticism in the future.
Techniques
Clinicians should consult appropriate imaging texts for further information on these
techniques.
Interpretation
The interpretation of adrenal and pituitary images with any of the modalities described
above should beperformed by a qualified and skilled diagnostic imager.

Theproducts that can be used to treat superficial ectoparasites arelisted inTable 14.1and
described below.The numbers in the tableprovideaguide as to therecommended orderin
whichthe products should be used.These recommendations are based on such factors as
licensed indications,known efficacy,safety and ease of use.The sequential use of products
is indicated in situations where the first product has proved to be ineffective.
Clinicians should be aware that the unlicenseduse ofproducts such as ivermectin and
milbemycin is illegal insome countries.In theUKand USA,theseproducts should only be
used according to the following guidelines:
Clinicians should first use a product specifically licensed (labelled) for the
condition.
If no product is specifically licensed for the condition,clinicians should try a
product licensed for that species for a similar condition.
If both of the above products are clinically ineffective,the extra label use of an un-
licensed product is appropriate as long as there is a valid client/patient/veterinarian
relationship.
Clinicians should obtain written client consent when using products in an extra-
label manner.
Clinicians should alsobe aware of the requirementsfor the safe use and disposal of insecti-
cidal products.Veterinary staff and ownersmust always read theproduct labels carefully to
ensure that these chemicals are used safely and disposed of in a way that will not contam

Whatifthepyodermarespondsbutthenrelapses?
Many casesof superficial pyodermarespond toappropriate antibacterial therapy and do not
recur.In these cases,the underlying cause is likely to be something transient such as swim
ming in dirty water:lying on dirty ground; trauma to the skinfrom thorns orgrooming: tran
sient scratching orlicking:oran immature immune system.In somecases,the originalcause
of theinfection isnever established.
In other cases，the infection responds completely to antibacterial therapy but then
relapses a few days to a fewweeks after the therapyhasbeen stopped.The most common
reason for this is failure to identify and treat anunderlying cause.In such cases,clinicians
shouldrule out:
Ectoparasitism,especially demodicosis
Atopic dermatitis
Food allergy
Hypothyroidism
Hyperadrenocorticism
OSexhormoneabnormality
Systemic diseases
Primary scaling disorders
The order in which theseunderlying causes are investigated should be based on the clini-
cian's index of suspicion.If the condition is still pruritic after thebacterial infectionhas
resolved,theparasitic and allergic diseases shouldbe ruled out first.If the condition is non
pruritic after the infection has resolved, the most likely causes are sub-clinical atopic der-
matitis,demodicosis.hypothyroidism,hyperadrenocorticism, sex hormone abnormalities
and systemic diseases.
If all the above conditions have been ruled out and the infection keeps recurring. the
clinician can make a diagnosis of idiopathic recurrent pyoderma. This condition is thought
tobe due to a cutaneousimmunodeficiencybut there are currently no diagnostic tests that
can beused to confirm thediagnosis.In such cases,there are three therapeutic strategies that
can be used for long term maintenance.
1.Aggressiveandfrequent topical therapywith oneof theshampoos describedabove.
Although this strategy isbeneficial,it rarely controls thepyoderma alone.
2.Immunomodulation with staphylococcal bacterins.Some externallaboratories can
make an autogenous bacterin from staphylococcal organisms cultured from the affected
dog.Alternatively,a commercially availablebacterin such as Staphage lysate°can be
considered.The success rate of both these strategies is variable,but they do represent
an alternative to continuous antibiotic therapy in some cases.
3.Long-term antibiotic therapy.After the pyoderma has been brought under control with
antibiotics,a reducing dosage regime can be prescribed.This may take the form of
pulse therapy (e.g.1 week on,2 weeks off),or daily low dose therapy. This type of
regime has to be tailored to theindividual case takinginto account such factors as the
frequency of relapse and variation in response.For long-term use,cephalexin,
oxacillin or clavulanic acid potentiated amoxycillin are the antibiotics of choice.
As the need for this type of therapy is rare,clinicians are advised toseekfurther advicefrom
dermatologyspecialistsbefore embarkingon these treatmentregimes.

Allergenimmunotherapy
Allergen immunotherapy (hyposensitisation or desensitisation) involves the subcutaneous
injection ofgraduallyincreasingdoses of relevant allergens over aperiod of time untila
maintenance dose is reached.The treatment is thought to work by correcting the imbalance
in the animal's T lymphocyte populations with the net effect that Interleukin-4 secretion is
reduced.This reduces IgE synthesis and encourages IgG synthesis,which may be protective.
Formulation,dosageschedule and routeofadministration:
Selection of the allergens tobe included in the vaccine is based on the positive results
obtained in either the intradermal skin test or in-vitro test. Some companies and dermato-
logists limit the number of allergens in a vaccine to ten. If more than ten allergens are
thought tobesignificant,asecondvaccine canbemadeup.Other dermatologists simplyput
all the relevant allergens into one vaccine. To date,there is no evidence that one method is
superior to the other.
Allergen vaccines are either prepared in aqueous form or alum-precipitated form.Both
types are given subcutaneously.although alum-precipitated vaccines should be injected at
four different sites around the animal to avoid reactions (rightneck,left neck,right flank,
left flank)
Aqueous vaccines are prepared in three different vials,with vial 3 being ten times more
concentrated than vial 2, and vial 2 being ten times more concentrated than vial 1. Alum-
precipitatedvaccines are prepared in a singlevial.
The dosage schedules for these two formulations are differentbecause of different rates
ofabsorption.ThescheduleforaqueousallergensisshowninTable14.3andalum-
precipitated allergens in Table 14.4.
Efficacy
Allergen immunotherapy takes 2-9 monthsbeforea beneficialeffect is seen.The normal
recommendation is that dogs receive the vaccine for at least a year before a final decision is
made as to its efficacy.Therefore.during the early phase of allergen immunotherapy.it is
usually necessary to use some additional therapy to control the clinical signs.In most stud-
ies published to date,similar success rates have been reported.Twenty-five per cent of
atopic dogs can be controlledwith immunotherapy alone.Afurther50%show abeneficial
response,but the dog requires some other form of non-steroidal therapy.The remaining 25%
show no response at all. The success rate of allergen immunotherapy in cats is suspected to
besimilar,butprecisefigures arenotknown.Ownersneed tobeinformedof theslownature
of this type of treatment and thelikely success rates so that they don't have unrealistic
expectations.If successful, allergen immunotherapy must be continued for the remainder of
the animal'slifein thevast majority of cases.

Antihistamines
Antihistamines are used in the management of atopic dermatitis because histamine is a
major inflammatory mediatorreleased from mast cells during allergic inflammation.
Thefollowing antihistamines are commonly used to treat canine atopic dermatitis.
Chlorpheniramine
Trade name:Piriton.
Formulation:4 mg tablet.
Dose androuteofadministration:
0.4 mg/kg every 8 hours, orally.
Clemastine
Trade names: Tavegil, Tavist,Aller-eze
Formulation: 1 mg tablet.
Dose and route ofadministration:
0.05 mg/kg every 12 hours,orally
Hydroxyzine
Trade names:Atarax
Formulation: 25 mg tablet.
Dose androute ofadministration:
2.2 mg/kg every 8 hours. orally.
Diphenhydramine
Trade names:Benadryl, Nytol.
Formulation:25mg tablet.
Dose and route ofadministration:
2.2 mg/kg every 8 hours, orally.
Cyproheptadine
Trade names:Periactin
Formulation:4mg tablet.
Dose and route of administration:
0.1-1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours,orally.
Efficacy
Antihistamines have been found tobe ineffective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis by
many practitioners. However, although they cannot be regarded as a substitute for gluco-
corticoids,they can be effective in 10-20% of cases.It is important when prescribing anti-
histamines to try at least three different drugs for a week each before determining the overall
efficacy. This is because failure to respond to one drug does not imply that the animal will
not respond to another.The antihistamine trial should onlybe attemptedwhen all other sec-
ondaryproblems are under control.The client shouldbe told tokeep a diary andnote the
level of pruritus each week.If one drug is clearly better than the others,it shouldberepeated
Avtorsko zasciteno gradivo

to determine if the effect is sustained. If it is,the drug can be continued in the medium to
immunotherapy.
Major adverse effects:
Antihistamines are not licensed for the treatment of animals in the UK or USA. The major
adverse effect of antihistamines is drowsiness.If this occurs,the drug should be stopped and
an alternative antihistamine tried.

Discontinue and resort to other therapies
Topical therapy
Topical therapy is an invaluable part of the management programme when treating canine
atopic dermatitis but it is rarely used in cats.Topical therapy may take the form of sham-
poos, soaks, sprays or ointments. Shampoos are beneficial because:
They can be used to manage secondary bacterial or yeast infections.
They remove sweat, sebum and other cutaneous debris.
They can be used primarily for anti-pruritic effects.
They can remove allergens from the skin surface.
In addition to antimicrobial shampoos(described in earlier sections),thefollowingsham
poos and soaks canbe useful for topical treatment in atopic dermatitis.The ointments and
sprays can be used for spot treatment of focal areas of thebody that are proving difficult to
control(e.g.the perineum,the feet,the medialpinnae)
1.Wet the entire body of the dog with warm water.
2.Apply small quantities of shampoo to various parts of the body and lather all over.
Avoidgettingshampoointo theeyes.
3.Massage the shampoo into the skin for 10 minutes,especially in the most severely
affected areas.The 10-minute contact time is essential for therapeutic activity.
4.Rinse well and allow to dry in a warm,draught-free environment.
5.Repeat the bath two or three times a week initially, and then as required.

the level of potency required and apply the creams or sprays once or twice daily to the
affected area.If prolonged treatment is used,thelowestpotency cream should beused at the
lowest frequency possible.
Beneficialandadverseeffects:
Topical glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs and they canbe very effective at
treating focal areas of atopic dermatitis.However, topical glucocorticoids can suppress the
pituitary adrenal axis and lead to elevated liver enzymes.Prolonged use can also cause thin-

the condition is less than that of the other patterns.
4.Prednisolone should be prescribed at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg/day, divided into two
doses given 12 hours apart.This initial dose should last for5-14 days,depending on
the severity and response. Lesions of the eosinophilic granuloma complex and head
and neck pruritus occasionally require higher doses than this.
5. Once the lesions have responded, the dose should be tapered and stopped. This allows
the effects of specific treatments to be determined e.g.response to flea control,ecto-
parasiticides, food trials, etc.
6.Long-term depot injections of glucocorticoids should be avoided because they may
interfere with future testing(especially intradermal testing).
7.If there is cytological evidence of bacterial infection(especially eosinophilic gran-
uloma complex).systemicantibioticsshouldbeprescribedfor3-4weeks
8.If dermatophytosis is suspected (especially symmetrical alopecia), avoid the use of
glucocorticoids until the condition hasbeen ruled in or out on culture.
9.Glucocorticoidsmust be withdrawn for 3-4 weeks before intradermal testing(depend-
ing on the dose/duration of therapy). Clinicians should checkwith the testing site what
is required.
Treatmentprinciplesforchronicoridiopathiccases
1.If the diagnostic work-up does not yield a definitive diagnosis,long-term management
may be required.
2.Prednisolone should be used on an alternate day basis at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day.
3.If the lesions do not respond,or if the owner can not administer tablets on a long-term
basis,consider depot injections of methylprednisolone acetate (20 mg/cat)every 2
months.
4.Try antihistamines to determine if the dose of steroids can be reduced.Chlorpheni-
ramine should be prescribed at a dose of 2 mg/cat every 12 hours.
5.Try essential fatty acids to determine if the dose of steroids can be reduced.Prescribe

TREATMENTOFHOTSPOTS(PYOTRAUMATICDERMATITIS)
Treatment objectives
1. To identify and treat the underlying cause.
2.To provide symptomatic treatment of thehot spot itself.
Treatmentprinciples
1.Perform appropriate tests to determine the underlying cause (see Chapters 3 and 13).
Initiate specific treatment as appropriate.
2.Check the anal sacs or ears (depending on the location of the lesion).Express the anal
sacs if necessary and treat the earsif abnormal.
3.Clip away matted fur from around the lesion.Check to see if there is evidence of super
ficial pyoderma in the surrounding skin.If there is,initiate appropriate treatment (see.
p.240).
4.Clean thelesion and remove crusted exudate using a dilute solution of chlorhexidene
or povidone-iodine.
5.In most cases,treatment with glucocorticoids is indicated to break the itch-scratch
cycle.Oral prednisolone can be administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily for 3-5 days
followed by 2 days at 0.5 mg/kg.
6.Topicalapplication ofantibiotic/glucocorticoid creamis alsobeneficial toprovidea

antibiotics. Cephalexin is the drug of choice and treatment must be continued for up
to 8weeks.Thelesion should alsobe washed dailywith benzoylperoxide shampoo,
unless this proves to be irritant.
5.If the clinician is sure that infection is not involved, or if the lesion fails to respond
completelyto antibacterial therapy.various topicaltherapieshavebeen recommended
that canbe applied to thelesion directly.Therecipes for these treatments are described
below.
6.If the lesion does not respond to topical treatment, the clinician can try sublesional
injections of methylprednisolone acetate(Depo-Medrone°,Depo-Medrol).Thisis only
likely tobe successful in small lesions less than 3 cm in diameter.
7.If the clinician suspects a psychological component to the problem,behaviour modif-
cation is indicated. This might include the provision of more walks,more freedom,
more human companionship,more canine companionship.more toys,more chews,
andremoval of obvious sources of stress.
8.If behaviour modification is not possible ornot totally successful,various psychologi
cal drugs can be prescribed.These include clomipramine.fluoxetine,amitriptyline

9.If medical management fails,other therapies that havebeen performed with variable
success include surgical resection,laser therapy,radiation therapy.cryosurgery.and

These drugs should not be used in male breeding dogs or pregnant females.All these drugs
can cause anorexia,vomiting.diarrhoea,lethargy,hyperexcitability.polydipsia,personality
changes and reduction in seizure threshold.More serious adverse effects include cardiac
arrhythmias,heart block,dry mouth,urine retention and reduced tear production.These
drugs should be used with caution in dogs with cardiovascular disease,epilepsy,glaucoma,
reduced gastrointestinal motility and urinary retention.Massive overdosage with these

TREATMENTOFDEMODICOSIS
Treatmentobjectives
1.To eliminate the excessive number of demodexmites.
2.To attempt to identify and treat the underlying cause in adult-onset cases.
Treatment principles
1.The treatment recommendations for demodicosis vary depending on whether the case
is localised or generalised.
2.With localised demodicosis,90% of cases will resolve spontaneously. The most appro-
priate course of actionwhen presented with a case for the first time is to discuss the
condition with the owner,delay treatment and arrange areinspection 4weeks later. If
the condition is resolving or completely static,no treatment is indicated.However,if
there is any evidence of newlesions,or the original lesions are spreading.the condi
tion should be treated asforgeneralised demodicosis.
3.The treatment of generalised demodicosis can be a long,frustrating and expensive
process.If a successful outcome is tobe expected,it is important topay close attention
to thefollowingtreatmentguidelines.
4.NEVERADMINISTER GLUCOCORTICOIDSTO ADOGWITHDEMODICOSIS,EVEN
IF IT ISHIGHLYPRURITIC.
5.If the disease develops when the dog is an adult (over 2 years of age), try and identify
an underlying cause.Perform routine haematology and biochemistry,urine analysis
andrule out hyperadrenocorticism.In addition,thoracic and abdominal radiography
and ultrasonography may be indicated.
6.If thereissecondarybacterial infection,thedogshould be treatedconcurrentlywith
systemic antibioticsuntil thepyoderma hasresolved.

7.Dogs withmedium orlong hair coats should be clipped to allow effective miticidal
treatment.
8.Prior to each miticidal treatment,the dog should be bathed in a benzoyl peroxide
shampoo.This removes scale and crusts,opens up the follicles,and kills bacteria.If
the benzoylperoxide proves irritant，an alternative antibacterial shampoo can be
used.Thedogshould be towel dried before the miticidal treatmentis applied toavoid
dilution.
9.Miticidal treatment should be commenced initially with alicensedproduct.In the
UKandUSA,theonlylicensedproductfor thetreatmentofdemodicosisis amitraz.
Initial use of otherproducts in the UKcontravenes the prescribing cascade.Initial use
of other products in the USA is a violation of federal law.Amitraz should be applied
at the appropriate concentration at the appropriate intervals (see below).
10.The dog should be re-examined every 4 weeks.Take five skin scrapings from differ-
ent body regions at each visit.When a set of completely negative skin scrapings is
obtained,repeat the scrapings 4weeks later.If that set is also negative,the treatment
can be discontinued(see Chapter 13 for detailson performing and interpreting skin
scrapings).However,the dog should be monitored carefully for relapses.
11.Three to nine months of continuous treatment mayberequired to achieveparasito-
logical cure.However, during this time, the dog should be making continuous clin-
ical progress and the mite numbers should be decreasing on skin scrapings.
12.Entirebitches should be spayed when the disease has beenbrought under control but
before treatment is stopped.This is to prevent the disease relapsingwhen the dog
comes into oestrus.
13.There areno licensed products for the treatment of feline demodicosis.Recom
mended treatments include lime sulfur dips and selenium sulphide shampoos (see
the section on superficialectoparasites).

TREATMENTOFHYPERADRENOCORTICISM
Treatmentobjectives
To alleviate the dog's clinical signsby medical or surgical therapy
Treatment principles
1.The treatment of canine hyperadrenocorticism is determined by the cause.Adrenal
tumours are usually treated by surgicalresection.Adrenalectomy requires ahighly
skilled surgeonbacked up by a specialised medical team.The procedure is associated
with many intra-and post-operative complications and it is recommended that the
case bereferred to an institution with expertise in managing this condition.
2.Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism is usually treated medically with drugs that
destroy the adrenal cortex or suppress steroid synthesis.Treatment is required for the
remainder of the dog's life.
3.For many years,mitotane (o.p-DDD) was the medical treatment of choice for pituitary
dependant hyperadrenocorticism.However,trilostanehasrecentlybeenlicensed for
the treatment of hyperadrenocorticism in some countries.In countrieswhere this is the
case,this would be therecommended initial treatment,with mitotanebeingreserved
fordogsthatfail toadequatelyrespond.

is increased if the drug is given with food.After 14 days,the efficacy should be assessed
with an ACTH stimulation test.If satisfactory control of cortisol concentrations has been
achieved,the effective daily dose is continued and ACTH stimulation tests are performed
every 3-6 months.In occasional cases,doses of 20mg/kg every 12 hours are necessary.
Majoradverse effects:
Not licensed for use in dogs or cats.Ketoconazole may cause inappetence,vomiting,
lethargy,pruritus and a reversible lightening of the haircoat.It occasionally causes hepato-
toxicity and monitoring of liver enzymes is indicated if the animal appears unwell.Keto-
conazole is teratogenic and should not be used in pregnant animals.
L-deprenyl(Seleginine hydrochloride)
Trade name: Anipryl, Selgian.
Formulation: 4 mg and 10 mg tablet.
Dose,routeofadministration and treatmentschedule：
L-deprenyl can be used for the treatment of hyperadrenocorticism in cases that are unable
to toleratemitotane,but 50-70% of casesmay fail to respond.The initial dose is 1 mg/kg
every 24 hours,orally.If there is no response after 2months,the dose should be doubled to
2mg/kgevery 24 hours.If there is still noresponse,alternative treatment is necessary.The
efficacy of this therapy can only bemonitoredby clinical signs and ACTH stimulation tests
are not useful.
Majoradverse effects:
Adverse effects of L-deprenyl are uncommon and include diarrhoea, lethargy.restlessness
and disorientation.L-deprenylis amonoamine oxidase inhibitor and should notbe admin
istered alongside other drugs with the same effect (amitraz,tricyclic antidepressants,fluox-
etine.alpha-2-agonists). It should not be used during pregnancy or lactation.

TREATMENTOFDEEPBACTERIALPYODERMA
Treatmentobjectives
1.To identify the organisms responsible for the deeppyoderma (usually Staphylococcus
intermediusbut occasionally gram-negative organisms).
2.To successfully eliminate the bacterial infection.
3.To identify and treat the underlying cause to prevent recurrence.
Treatmentprinciples
1.Successful treatment of deep pyoderma is best achieved with a combination of sys-
temic and topical therapy.
2.For systemic therapy. an appropriate antibiotic should be chosen on the basis of cul-
ture and sensitivity testing. Examples of antibiotics likely to be useful are shown in
Table 14.13.
3.Use an adequate dose based on the dog's body weight.
4. Treat for an appropriate length of time. For deep pyoderma, treatment may last for
months,but should be continued for 2-4 weeks past complete clinical cure.Complete
clinical cure should be determined by the clinician on thebasis of palpation aswell as
observation.
5.DONOTUSE CONCURRENT CORTICOSTEROIDS.as thiswillinhibit thebody's abil-
ity to clear the infection and maylead to recurrence.
6.If possible, treat at the same time with an appropriate shampoo (see later).
7.Treat or control the underlying cause.
8.Reinspect the dog every 3-4weeks to monitor clinical response.Prescribe continued
treatment until completely resolved.
Antibioticsforthe treatmentof deeppyoderma
Unlike with superficial pyoderma,culture and sensitivity testing should be performed in
dogs with deep pyoderma at the first visit.The antibiotics that are likely tobe suitable for
the treatment of deeppyodermaarelisted inTable14.13and described below.Ifanumber

required frequency of administration,availability,personal preferences and the following
factors:
Penicillin,ampicillin,amoxycillin and tetracycline are not suitable because the
organism islikely torapidly developresistant to these antibiotics.
Clindamycin,lincomycinand tylosin arenotgood choicesfordeepstaphylococcal
pyoderma becauseresistance may develop during the long course of treatment.

Beneficial and adverseeffects:
Benzoyl peroxide is a good antibacterial agent that also has a degreasing and follicular flush-
ing action. It has good residual activity.It can be used in all cases of pyoderma but it is the
shampoo of choice if the coat is greasy or in cases secondary to demodicosis.However,ben-
zoyl peroxide can be irritating to the skin and lead to excessive dryness of the coat.If this
occurs,an alternativeproduct shouldbe used.Benzoylperoxide can alsobleach carpets and
furnishings.
Ethyllactate
Trade names:DermacleanseEtiderm
Formulation:Shampoo.
Dose and route of administration:
Topical application as described above.
Beneficial and adverse effects:
Ethyl lactate is a good antibacterial agent with good residual activity. Ethyl lactate is less
irritating and drying than benzoyl peroxide.
Mupirocin
Trade names:Bactroban,Bactoderm
Formulation:Ointment.
Dose and route of administration:
Apply to focal areas of deep pyoderma once or twice daily
Beneficial and adverse effects:
Mupirocin is useful for localised areas of deep pyoderma such as acne, calluses, pressure
points and interdigital pyoderma.The ointment should not be applied to broken skin.
Adverse effects are uncommon.
What if the treatmentfails?
A deep pyoderma may fail to respond to antibacterial therapy for the following reasons:
Reasonforfailure
Solution
Choice of inappropriate antibiotic
Use one of the drugs shown in Table 14.13
Underdosing
Calculate the dose based on the dog's
bodyweight
Insuficient duration of therapy
Treat for a minimum of 2-4 weeks past clinica
cure
Concurrent use of glucocorticoids
Do not administer glucocorticoids when
treating pyoderma
Resistance of the organism to the drug chosen
Choose the drug on the basis of culture and
sensitivity tests

Whatif thepyoderma respondsbutthenrelapses?
The most common reason for a deeppyoderma to respond but then relapse a few days to a
fewweeksafter the therapyhasbeen stopped isfailure to identifyand treatanunderlying
cause.In such cases, clinicians should rule out:
Demodicosis
Atopicdermatitis
Food allergy
Hypothyroidism
Hyperadrenocorticism
Systemic orneoplastic diseases
The order inwhich these underlying causes areinvestigated should be based on the clini-
cian's index of suspicion.If the condition is pruritic after the bacterial infection has
resolved,theparasitic and allergic diseases should beruled out first.If the condition is non-
pruritic after the infection has resolved,the most likely causes are demodicosis,hypo-
thyroidism,hyperadrenocorticism,systemic diseases and neoplasia.If all the above
conditions have been ruled out and theinfectionkeeps recurring.the clinician can make a
diagnosis of idiopathicrecurrentpyoderma or breed-specificpyoderma(German shepherd
dogs,Englishbull terriers).Readersshouldconsult the sectionon staphylococcalpyoderma
(page 248)for details on the long-term management of these conditions.
Unusual deepbacterialinfections
Thebacterialinfections described in this section arerare andwill not be discussed in detail.
The treatment options for these infections are summarised inTable 14.14.If possible,the
choice of antibacterial agent should be based on the results of culture and sensitivity
testing.

3.Widespread or systemic deep fungal infections require long courses of systemic anti-
fungal agents.
4. In some cases, drugs need to be used in combination to achieve resolution of the
disease.
5.Treatment should continue for 1-3 months after thelesions have completely resolved.
6.DONOT USE CORTICOSTEROIDS,as this can allow the organism to disseminate with
fatal consequences.
7.Some cases of deep fungal infection cannotbe cured.
8.Owners and veterinary staff shouldbe warned that some of these infections are

Dose androute ofadministration:
1.Amphotericin B is given as a series ofintravenous infusions every 48hours (usually
performed on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule).
2.Prior to the first dose of amphotericin B,a complete blood count,biochemistry profile
and urinalysis should be performed.Patients with renal failure,blood dyscrasias or
electrolyteimbalancesshouldbe treatedbefore amphotericinBisadministered.Before
each additional treatment,a PCV,total protein,urea,creatinine and urinalysis should
beperformed.If theserumcreatininehasrisen togreater than250pmol/1 or theserum
urea nitrogen to greater than 15 nmol/l, the treatment should be discontinued until
renal function has normalised.
3.Before each treatment,the patient should be given 50 ml/kg 0.9%NaCl over 3-4hours
to induce a diuresis and minimiserenal toxicity.
4.For the first treatment of amphotericin B,a test dose of 0.25 mg/kg should be dissolved
in 250-500mlof 5%dextroseand administeredover 2-3hours.TheamphotericinB
must not be allowed to contact the 0.9% saline solution as itprecipitates in thepres
ence of electrolytes.
5.After the treatment, the patient should be diuresed again with 0.9% NaCl at twice
6.If thepatient tolerates the initial treatment,the procedure should berepeated every48
hours usinga dose of 0.5mg/kg (dog) or 0.25 mg/kg (cat) until a total cumulative dose
7.Amphotericin B should be used in conjunction with an azole drug such as ketocona-
zole or itraconazole tominimise the total doserequired.
Avtorsko zasciteno gradivo

Smallanimal dermatology
Majoradverse effects:
Not licensed for use in dogs and cats.Amphotericin B is extremely nephrotoxic and can lead
tolife-threatening acute renal failure.The treatment protocols used should be designed to
minimise this complication.The administration of amphotericinB often causes phlebitis at
the site of catheter placements,necessitating theuse of anumberof peripheral veins in order
to complete thetreatment.In the early stages of treatment,patientsmaybecome pyrexic fol-
lowing the treatment.This may be due to the pyrogenic effects of some batches of ampho-
tericin B or it may be secondary to circulating pyrogens released from dying fungal
organisms. Other adverse effects include nausea,vomiting.dyspnoea,hypothermia and
hypotension although these signs may also be related to the products released by dying
fungal organisms.
Potassiumiodide
Trade name: Generic.
Formulation:Supersaturatedsolution
Dose androute of administration:
Dogs:40 mg/kg every 12 hours, orally with a fatty food (cream or milk).
Cats:
10-20 mg/kg every 12-24 hours,with food.
Majoradverseeffects:
Potassium iodide can cause anorexia,vomiting,diarrhoea,and lethargy.In addition,dogs
may develop an oculo-nasal discharge,a dry hair coat and skin scaling. Cats may develop
hypothermia,twitching and cardiovascular abnormalities.

respond to appropriate doses of prednisolone.For adverse effects,see prednisolone.
Azathioprine
Trade name:Imuran.
Formulation:25and50mg tablets.
Dose androute ofadministration:
Induction: 50 mg/m² or 2.2 mg/kg every 24 hours, orally,until clinical response.
Maintenance:50 mg/m² or 2.2mg/kg every 48 hours,orally.
Note:To convert body weight into surface area,see Table 14.18.Because of the available
tablet sizes and the undesirability of splitting the drug, it is not possible or necessary to
taper the dose of azathioprine in the samewayasprednisolone.Once the clinical signs are
completely in remission,the daily dose canbegiven every48-72hours.
Majoradverseeffects:
Azathioprineis extremely toxic to cats and the drugshouldnotbeusedin this species.The
major adverse effects of azathioprine in dogs are bone marrow suppression andgastro-
tion or temporary suspension of the drug.Most dogs develop a mild,asymptomatic,
non-regenerative anaemia that does not require cessation of therapy.If the total white blood
cell count drops to between 5.0-7.0x 10°/l,the dose should be reduced by 25%.If the total
white blood cell count drops to below 5.0× 1o°/l, the drug should be discontinued until the

ing agentprior to the application of other products.It should not be used in conjunc-
tionwithaminoglycosidesas the acidity caninactivatethe antibiotics
8.Silver sulfadiazine cream-the cream canbedilutedwithwater tomake a 0.5%solu
tion and applieddirectly to the ear canal
9.TrisEDTA-this solution canbe obtained commercially in theUSA (TrizEDTA°,
Dermapet) or made according to the followingrecipe:
●1.2 g EDTA
6.05 g Tris buffer
1 L of sterile distilled water
Adjusted to pH 8.0.
This solution potentiates the action of aminoglycosides and possibly fluoroquinolones.It
may also be directly bactericidal for Pseudomonas.The solution can be used as a flushing
or cleaning agent prior to the application of topical antibiotics.
Treatmentofotitismedia
If the tympanic membrane hasruptured,the clinician is faced with the treatment of otitis
media.This occurs most commonly due a long-standing otitis externa in which the infection
breaks through the tympanum.However,it can occasionally arise due toaprimaryinfection
in the middle ear cavity.If there are no irreversible pathological changes in the horizontal
canal orbullae,medical management can be successful.The dog should be anaesthetised and
the middle ear cavity flushed out with sterile saline.This is best achieved with a cut-down
urinary catheter attached to a 20 ml syringe and a drip set via a three-way tap.The catheter
should be extended into thebulla through an otoscopecone orvideo otoscope.The bulla and
ear canal should be thoroughly irrigated,allowing the excess material to flow up and out of
the ear. This procedure should be repeated every 2-3 days until the production ofexudate has
biotic based on culture and sensitivity testing.The ear should be checked by cytology every
2-3 daystomonitor thelevels of microbial infection.Satisfactory treatment is indicated by a
reductionin thenumber oforganisms and inflammatory cells,and then their disappearance.
If Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cultured, the treatment is particularly challenging.
Currently,the use of fluoroquinolones both topically and systemically at high doses is the
treatment of choice.Enrofloxacin should be used at a dose of 15-20 mg/kgand mar-
bofloxacin at a dose of 5.5mg/kg every 24 hours.This strategy can be effective even if the
culture and sensitivity results have indicated resistance.Alternatively.ticarcillin can be
used topically and systemically at a dose of15mg/kg every 8hours,given intravenously
drum should beavoided as these drugs areknown to be ototoxic.
Surgicalmanagementofotitis
Surgery can be used as an adjunctive treatment in the management of otitis, or in some
cases,it can be curative. The use of surgical techniques in the management of otitis is
