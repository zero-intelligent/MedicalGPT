wellasmetacarpus canbe evaluated byfetometry.Since
the radius and ulna are difficult to differentiate ultra-
sonically,theirechoes are usually seen asa single one.
Thebonesofthepelviclimbthatareavailableforfeto-
metricpurposesare theilum,ischium,femur,tibiaand
metatarsus (Fig.2.184 to 2.186and Tab.2.1).
The longbones of front andhind limbhave approxi-
mately thesame length and show similargrowthrates
(Fig.2.187,2.188and Tab.2.1).The 0ssified diaphyses
of scapulaumerusradius and ulna,mtacarpu-

Among thebones of thefront limb themetacarpusis
theeasiest toreachbyultrasonography and can,incases
of anterior presentation, still be depictedin advanced
pregnancy(Fig.2.183).When the metacarpal bones lie
closetothematernalpelvis,theoptimalrotationof the
ultrasoundprobewill oftenallowthem tobebrought in-
tothe optimalplane relative tothesoundbeamand
thus greatly facilitate the takingofreliable measure-
ments.Generally,all bones of the front andhind limbs
can be evaluated fetometrically until about the seventh
month ofpregnancy.After this stage theyare too large
tobe depicted completely on a singleultrasound image.
