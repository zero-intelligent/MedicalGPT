DEDICATION
This book is dedicated to
the many giants in the field of veterinary dentistry
who preceded us and shared their knowledge and expertise,
and to those around us who are rapidly becoming the giants of tomorrow.
Also to the concept that while black and white may be the easiest to recognize,
the most important information is often found in the shades of gray.
Linda J. DeBowes and Gregg A. DuPont

white line around the root made by the compact bone of the alveolus (the tooth socket). is visible
in some areas but absent in others. The bony plate of the alveolus is more apparent in areas where

the alveolar process. This bony plate forms the ventrolateral wall of the nasal cavity, diagonally con-

 of the alveolar process forms the foor of the infraorbital canal. In the molar area it forms the foor of

CHAPTER
Endodontic Disease
adiography is a vital component of veterinary end-
 odontic treatment. Radiographs provide information
 about the presence, nature, and severity of periapical
and root pathology. This information is essential for the di-
agnosis of endodontic disease as well as for the prognosis of
its treatment. Radiographs do not provide direct information
about pulp health; however, many of the effects of pulp pa-
thology are radiographically visible.
Clinical fndings that may indicate the presence of end-
odontic disease include a fractured tooth with exposure of
the pulp chamber, a discolored tooth, or an intraoral or ex-
traoral draining fistula. Except in the obvious case of a di-
rect pulp exposure, a definitive diagnosis of endodontic
pathology is difficult to make based only on clinical ex-
 amination of veterinary patients due to the limitations of
pulp testing and lack of patient input. Also, endodontic
disease can be present with very little clinical evidence.
This is particularly true of maxillary molar teeth that can
develop severe periodontitis with extension to the endodon-
tic tissues while exhibiting no clinical signs other than
slight mobility (Figure 6-1).
Human patients with endodontic pathology experience
various symptoms that range from very mild discomfort
when the tooth is loaded in the presence of apical periodon-
abscess. These symptoms alert human patients to the exis-
tence of a problem, which they can communicate to a den-
tist. In contrast, veterinary patients often tolerate significant

Chronic apical periodontitis usually results in formation
of a cyst or granuloma that appears radiographically as an
obvious radiolucency with distinct borders (Figure 6-4, F

mans. The border of the cyst or granuloma can also show
evidence of increased radiopacity due to sclerosing osteitis

humans. The palatal root of the maxillary fourth premolar
tooth in dogs can create a similar halo effect where the
expanding bone protrudes upward into the nasal cavity
(Figure 6-4, D). Another fonm of chronic apical periodontitis
is condensing, or sclerosing, osteitis that appears as a diffuse
increase in radiodensity with or without a radiolucency
(Figure 6-4, J).
Although the features of a radiographic lucency can
suggest the nature of the apical lesion, they cannot reli-
ably distinguish between an apical cyst, granuloma, or
abscess. Extracted teeth that are endodontically affected
frequently have granulomatous tissue attached to the root
tips (Figure 6-5). Apical infammation can progress to
 suppurative apical periodontitis. When this occurs, the
 inflammation and suppuration can dissect through tissues
(Figure 6-6) to form a draining fistula. Fistulas from end-
odontically involved maxillary incisor and canine teeth
commonly exit at the mucogingival line (MGL) directly
below the root apex, while fistulas from affected premolar
teeth commonly appear at the MGL in the furcation area.
 This is because the infammatory process dissects through
tissues following the path of least resistance. After travel-
ing under the loosely attached alveolar mucosa, it en-
counters the firmly attached gingiva where it deviates to

intermal fill (Figure 6-11). Dental radiographs do not always
fully refect the extent of resorptive damage to the root
(Figure 6-12). In contrast to intermal resorption that removes
dentin from the wall of the pulp cavity, pulpitis can also re-
sult in formation of tertiary, or reparative, dentin on the
walls of the pulp cavity. Pulpitis that is generalized over a
section of a root canal creates the radiographic effect of
a narower canal in that section, giving the appearance of a
more mature tooth. The extreme of this can manifest as
"'pulp cavity obliteration,”' a radiographic term that describes
an inability to identify sections of, or the entire, pulp space
(Figure 6-13). The term "pulp canal obliteration" is most
commonly used to describe an abnormal rather than a
physiological pulp chamber and root canal deposition of
mineral-dense material. The calcific metamorphosis of ad-

trauma to the pulp or its vascular supply, the root canal still
physically exists, although it can be very attenuated. Pulp
necrosis causes the opposite effect, arresting any further
dentin formation or tooth maturation. The result is a tooth
that appears radiographically less mature (wider root canal
space) than the adjacent teeth (Figure 6-14). Endodontic le-
(Figure 6-15).
Lucencies That Can Mimic Endodontic
Lesions
Apical radiographs can be challenging to interpret due to
the two-dimensional depiction of complicated anatomy
that combines trabecular (spongy) bone, compact bone,
soft tissue, and air spaces all projected at various angles
amd configurations. A radiolucency that commonly mim-
ics an LEO is the "chevron lucency" that can be associ-
ated with the root apices of incisor and canine teeth (see
Chapter 2). It is differentiated from a true endodontic le-
sion by its regular chevron shape compared with the more
circular or irregular-shaped lucencies often seen in LEOs.
 Other confusing lucencies and opacities can be created by
 the summation effect of superimposed structures, project-
ing overlying anatomy in a way that makes it appear to be 
associated with a tooth root or its supporting bone. These
can include bony foramena, bony fissures, bony canals, and

Etiology
 Two categories of insult that most commonly cause endodon-
tic disease are bacterial infection and dental trauma. Dental
pulp responds to injury in a manner similar to that of other
connective tissues. However, the circulation is very limited
 and the tissue is confined within a rigid space that restricts

its ability to swell. Trauma, infammation, or infection of the
pulp tissue can either heal or progress to irreversible pulpitis
or pulp necrosis.
When the pulp of a mature tooth is exposed to the oral
cavity, the pulp will eventually become infected and irrevers-
 ibly infamed, generally leading to pulp necrosis. A fractured
or worm tooth that has a direct exposure of the pulp chamber
requires root canal treatment or extraction (Figure 6-16). In
very specific cases, a vital direct pulp cap procedure may be
 done. But an exposed pulp will not heal without intervention.
A client should never be advised to "watch it to see if it de-
velops a problem."
Bacteria can also enter the endodontic system of a non-
 traumatized tooth through extension of periodontal disease.
If the periodontal epithelial attachment migrates apically to
an endodontic vascular entrance such as a lateral canal,
furcation communication, or the apical foramen or delta,
then the pulp could become infected (Figure 6-17). This is

STAGES
 There are a number of staging systems in the literature for
recording the severity or extent of lesions. Of these, the
most logical and clear one categorizes TRs by severity ac-
cording to objective and easily determined observation that
places them into stages that may have clinical relevance (see

Craniomandibular Osteopafhy
A less common cause of mandibular swelling is cranio-
mandibular osteopathy, a benign syndrome seen mainly
m young terrier breeds. The syndrome is self-limiting, but
the changes do not regress. It can cause significant discom-
fort, salivation, and difficulty prehending food. Mandibular
 swelling can be extreme, obliterating the rostral interman-
dibular space (Figure 8-27).

Developmental Dental
Abnormalities
evelopmental abnommalities occur commonly in dogs
and occasionally in cats. They can be caused by ab-
normal genetic coding or by damage to developing
tissues. The necessity of treatment is based on whether the
abnormality negatively impacts the health, function, or com-
fort of the patient. Radiographic evaluation of the extent of
involvement helps the clinician to determine which abnor-
malities require immediate intervention, which might require
treatment or monitoring, and which do not require any inter-
vention at all.

Abnormal Tooth Shape or Structure
Trauma to a deciduous tooth or infammation from a frac-
tured deciduous tooth can damage the enamel epithelium
 of the underlying developing permanent tooth, resulting in
a focal area of enamel hypoplasia or hypomineralization
(Figure 9-1). This is usually radiographically unremark-
able, but a radiograph should be made to evaluate pulp

supplies properly. Another important element is proper po-
sitioning. This chapter will discuss conventional dental radi-
ography using dental x-ray film. Digital radiography will be
considered in Chapter 13.
Film
Dental film is available in a range of sensitivities, referred
to as "film speeds," from A through F. The A speed film is
the least sensitive, and F speed is the most sensitive. The
sensitivity of the film determines the required exposure time;
faster-speed (higher-sensitivity) film requires less radiation
to expose (blacken) the film. Film sensitivity is increased
by using larger silver halide crystals in the emulsion. As a
result, E and F speed films produce images with a slight-
ly lower image quality in the same manner that larger and
fewer pixels decrease the image quality of digital camera
images. The decreased image quality only becomes signif-
cant when viewed using magnification. D speed and E speed
are commonly used. One popular film is E speed when hand
 processed and F speed when developed in an automatic pro-
cessor (Kodak Insight).
 Dental film is supplied in packets (Figure 12-1) with an
exterior nonabsorbent plastic envelope that acts as a barrier
to moisture and light. Inside the plastic envelope, the film is

Dental film is available in sizes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The
most commonly used sizes in dogs and cats are the size 2
(periapical) film (1%4 × 1%s inches, 31 × 41 mm) and the
size 4 (occlusal) film (2/4 × 3 inches, 57 × 76 mm) (Fig-
ure 12-2). Some operators find the size 0 (/ X 17/s inches)
useful for cats and small dogs. Dental film is provided in
single film packets, double film packets that make two
 identical radiographs, and duplicating flm that is sensitive
to incandescent light instead of x-rays. The backs of the
packets are color-coded to indicate the type of film
inside (Figure 12-3).
The film is oriented in the patient's mouth with the front
(Figure 12-4) toward the x-ray tube and the dimple (em-
 bossed circle in one cormer) positioned coronally rather than
apically. This is done to position the dimple away from the
 area of interest on the film.
Radiographs are best stored in film mounts where they
can be correctly oriented and properly labeled. There are a
number of mounts available for size 2 films (Figure 12-5).
There are also larger cardboard mounts available for indi-
vidual size 4 films. The mounted films can then be stored in

symphysis and angle of the roots relative to the oral sur-
faces. Similarly, film cannot be intraorally placed parallel to
any of the maxillary teeth due to the position of the palate
and lack of a high palatal vault in dogs and cats.
 The bisecting angle technique uses a principle of geometry
(the two sides of an isosceles triangle are equal in length) to
 prevent image elongation or foreshortening (Figure 12-7). The
film is placed intraorally as close to the tooth as possible.

Maxillary Incisor Teeth (Figure 12-10)
 One radiograph can include all the maxillary incisor teeth of 
small-to-medium breeds. The film is placed with the incisor
cusp tips along the short side of the film that has the dimple.
The tube is positioned perpendicular to the film when viewed
from the front and to bisect the angle when viewed from the
side. Large-breed dogs may require a separate radiograph
for the third incisor teeth, with the tube-head angled from
slightly more lateral when viewed from the front.
Maxillary Canine Teeth (Figure 12-11)
Size 4 (occlusal) film is helpful to avoid missing the root
apex. The flm is placed horizontally in the mouth with the
canine cusp tip on the outside (aboral) rostral comer of the
film. The tube is positioned to bisect the angle when viewed
from the side, and angled laterally from a dorsovental (DV)
position when viewed from the front. This projects the root
tip to the opposite cormer of the film from the cusp tip.
Maxillary Premolars (Figure 12-12)
The first through third premolars are often included on one
image, and a separate radiograph is made of the fourth pre-
molar. On small dogs, it may be possible to include all the
premolars on a single radiograph. The tube is positioned to
bisect the angle when viewed from the front and perpendicu-
lar to the film and alveolar ridge when viewed from the top
or side. Tube-shift can be performed as described above to
separate superimposed structures on the image.
Maxillary Molar Teeth (Figure 12- 13)
The alveolar arch curves medially behind the premolars in
most dogs (see Figure 12-8). The tube is positioned to bisect
the angle when viewed from rostrolateral (from the mesial
contact surface of the tooth), and perpendicular to the film,
the buccal surface of the molars and alveolar ridge when

Safety
The Intermational Commission on Radiological  Protection
makes safety recommendations based on justification, optimi-
zation, and limitation. Justification means exposures should
not be done unless a positive net benefit can be expected.
Optimization mandates using the least amount of radiation
required to produce the needed result. And limitation speaks
to the dose equivalence limits allowed for employees.
tient's tissues interacted with the x-rays, deflecting some but
absorbing most. X-rays (similar to gamma rays) are a type
of ionizing radiation. Ionization can affect tissues in multi-
ple ways, but the ones of concerm during dental radiographs
are the somatic stochastic effects; damaging effects that may
occur with any dose of radiation. A safe dose has not been
possible to determine experimentally. Every exposure car-
ries the possibility of inducing these effects that include
leukemia and certain tumors. While a decreased radiation
 dose reduces the probability of damage occurring, if damage 
does occur the dose does not affect the severity of the cell
damage. It has been estimated that the risk of developing a
fatal cancer from two average intraoral dental exposures is
around 1:2 million.
 Sources of exposure to radiation include the primary
beam, scatter radiation, and leakage from the tube head.
 Leakage should be discovered and resolved during regularly
scheduled equipment testing. The radiation emitted when an
x-ray is made scatters from the patient in all directions, but
a much larger amount passes directly through the patient; it
B
is not blocked. Dental film does not use an intensifying
screen. Therefore much larger doses of radiation are needed
to expose it than are required for film in cassettes. The quan-
tity of x-rays that pass completely through the patient and
exits the other side is far more than is needed for a diagnos-
tic radiograph (Figure 13-5). Staff should minimize their
exposure by standing at least 6 feet from the tube head and
always at an angle of 90 to 135 degrees from the path of the
primary beam. This eliminates the possibility of ever being
close to the primary beam and precludes the ability to hold
flm in position during a radiograph exposure.
Radiation safety procedures must be in place AND
 must be followed. It is the veterinarian's responsibility to
see to this.
Use short-cone technique and either high-speed film or
digital radiography to minimize the quantity and energy of
x-rays needed to make an image.
