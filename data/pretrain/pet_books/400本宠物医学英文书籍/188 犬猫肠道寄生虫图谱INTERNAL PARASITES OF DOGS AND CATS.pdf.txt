Effects of im mature heartworms:
Disease associated with Diroflaria inmmritis may not be limited to mature adult worms.
Advancement of L to immature adult heartworm (Ls) begins at 50 days post infection.
By day 58 approximately half of the L4 have become immature adults, and by day
70 all L4 are now immature adults. These small worms (approx. 1.5 cm) are
carried by the flow of blood to the pulmonary arteries. Inflammatory events
associated with these and maturing later stages include peri-arteritis,
interstitial edema and inflammatory interstitial disease. These immature
worms in the pulmonary vessels are not detectable by veterinarians

dogs and cats; some of these are important zoonotic agents.
The following descriptions will help you choose the most appropriate diagnostic
procedure. You will also find guidelines and techniques to help achieve the greatest
success while conducting these procedures.
DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES
DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES
INTERNAL PARASITES OF DOGS AND CATS
Direct smear
The direct smear technique is most appropriate when:
· You suspect protozoa that can be demonstrated as active motile stages
(e.g., Giardia or trichomonads).
· You suspect a parasite that passes motile larval stages in feces.
· Flotation solution might distort the parasite stages you wish to detect.
Notes:
Many larvae also can be recovered in a flotation procedure.
The direct smear procedure is convenient and fast, but has low
sensitivity due to the small amount of feces used and the amount of
debris on the slide.
Direct smear procedure:
62
1. Apply a small amount of fresh feces to water or saline solution
on a slide and mix thoroughly.
2. Add a coverslip.
3. Examine the entire slide.Thickness of the smear should allow
reading newsprint placed beneath it.
Note:
Iodine can be added to the direct smear at the coverslip margin to
stain motile protozoa, cysts or larvae— or for flotation techniques,
the coverslip can be added to a drop of iodine already placed on
the slide.
The sedimentation procedure is most appropriate when:
Sedimentation
· Parasite stages are too heavy to float in standard flotation solutions
(e.g., heavy operculated fluke eggs or larvae of lungworms).
· Flotation solutions may distort the parasite stages you wish to detect.
Notes:
Centrifuging sedimentation samples can increase test speed and improve
performance.
Some larvae can be recovered in a flotation procedure.

CAPC GUIDELINES

lnCtn.i
The Companion Animal Parasite Counsel (CAPC) is an independent counsel of U.S.
veterinary, governmental, and association thought leaders brought together to create
guidelines for optimal control of internal and external parasites. These guidelines have
been developed to protect the health of pets, enhance the safety of the public, and
measures to protect pets from parasitic infections. Veterinarians, pet owners, and
physicians should work together to reduce the risks associated with zoonotic
transmission of parasitic diseases. Important preventive measures include:
practicing good personal hygiene; controlling pet parasite infections through internal
environmental contamination with infective parasite stages, and understanding and
communicating parasitic infection risks and effective control measures.
