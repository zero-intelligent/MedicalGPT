 Key Facts
I A life-threatening volume of blood can accumulate within the gastrointestinal tract, with little or no visible signs of external blood
loss.
■
 Abdominal distension may be due to gas, fluid, organomegaly, or poor abdominal muscle tone.
■
 PLE in a young dog with chronic intermittent diarrhea, without hookworms, should prompt a suspicion of chronic intussuscep-
tion.
■
 Aggregated (accordion-like) small bowel loops on abdominal palpation are characteristic of a linear foreign body obstruction in
cats.
 A sick animalthat vomits shortly after abdominal palpation should be suspected of having a Gl obstruction, severe Gl tract inflam-
 mation, or pancreatitis.
■
 Rectal examination should be performed in every patient presenting for evaluation of gastrointestinal disease.

Generally, the clinical state of the animal in conjunction with
radiographic findings provides adequate information to make
quiring surgery or not. However, when abdominal radio-
 graphic findings are unclear, an obstruction cannot be ruled
out, or the radiographic findings do not explain the severity of
the clinical signs, fiurther diagnostic procedures are warranted.
Ultrasonography has the advantage that it does not require
ionizing radiation and can be used to inspect the small intes-
tines for wall layering,thickness, dilation, and peristalsis as well
 as for intraluminal, intramural, and extraluminal causes of ob-
struction. Lack of peristalsis occurring together with general-

small intestinal segments will appear gatheredup with the lin-
ear foreign material binding them together.The surrounding
 mesenterium should be examined for increased echogenicity
 and free fluid, which could be indicative of rupture.
Intestinal intussusception can usually be quickly diagnosed
with ultrasound. Multilayered, concentric rings of bowel can 
be identified (Figure 1.28).The outer bowel segment is often
thickened,edematous, and hypoechoic. More normal appear-
 ing inner segments can also be identified. Hyperechoic tissue
representing invaginated mesenteric fat may also be detected.
 In older animals, careful examination of the affected bowel for
nodular infltrations of the bowel wall and regional lymphad-
enomegaly is important since underlying neoplastic disease
may be responsible for the intussusception.

Chronic diarrhea
Chronic diarrhea due to small intestinal disease is common in
dogs and cats. Survey radiographs are often nonspecific and
 gastrointestinal contrast studies are often unrewarding in pa-
tients with chronic diarrhea without vomiting. For detecting
intestinal wall infiltrates, ultrasound is superior to survey and
contrast radiography Abdominal ultrasound allows for an as-

 Diffuse bowel wall infiltration
A number of gastrointestinal diseases lead to diffuse infiltration
of the small intestinal wall. There are no known specific sono-
graphic features that allow differentiation of the different in-
filtrative diseases. However, ultrasonography is important for
localizinglesions within the gastrointestinal tract and allowing
further characterization of the degree of infiltration inferred
by wall thickness and the appearance of wall layering. The

affected (Figure 1.29).The mucosa may also exhibit alterations

small intestine generally shows some dilation with fluid and
Thickening of the intestinal wall or a single layer due to in-
flammatory disease is difficult to differentiate from neoplastic
infiltration. For example, a thickened muscularis layer alone
can occur with either inflammatory or neoplastic infiltrates or
can be due to smooth muscle hypertrophy. Lymph nodes may
appear rounded, heterogenous, and possibly show target le-
sions in patients with either disease. Mycotic diseases such as
histoplasmosis, pythiosis, and cryptococcosis can produce lo-
calized infiltrative disease that is sonographically similar to that
of localized neoplasia.33 However, neoplasia is considered to
produce more disruption of the wall layering compared to
inflammatory disease.36 Sonographic changes in patients with
alimentary lymphosarcoma may include thickening of the
stomach or intestinal wall, loss of normal layering, a hypoe-
choic mass associated with the intestinal wall (Figure 1.30),
and abdominal lymphadenomegaly 3738

 Pancreatitis
While ultrasound is generally considered a valuable tool for
the diagnosis of canine pancreatitis, its sensitivity in cats with
pancreatitis is variable.6 In patients with acute pancreatitis the
pancreatic parenchyma becomes hypoechoic and enlarged.
The surrounding mesentery of the pancreas is often diffusely
hyperechoic and poorly circumscribed. However, these
changes may be subtle in cats. When the mesenterium is in-
flamed and the bowel loops are distended with gas, the pan-
creatic tissue itself may be difficult to identify ultrasonograph-
ically (Figure 1.40). Mild to moderate accumulations of free
fluid may be detected in the cranial abdomen. Together with
a hyperechogenic mesentery this may indicate the presence of

 Thoracic radiography should be performed in every patient with regurgitation in order to assess the esophagus and rule out aspira-
tion pneumonia. However, dynamic contrast studies are often necessary to diagnose the cause of dysphagia.
High quality radiographs of the abdomen in two orthogonal planes should be performed in patients presented for vomiting and are
important for ruling out obstructive ileus. Abdominal ultrasound and /or barium studies may be indicated when radiography does
not allow definitive ruling out of an obstructive lesion.
 Ultrasound is indicated in dogs and cats presenting with icterus. Hepatic vs. post-hepatic causes can be investigated and ultrasound-
guided biopsies of the liver or pancreas can be performed.
Abdominal ultrasound is clinically useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in both dogs and cats. The examination should include

 extrahepatic diseases, such as hyperadrenocorticism or bone disease can cause abnormalities.
 A pre- and postprandial serum bile acids concentration is the most clinically useful test to assess liver function in both dogs and
cats.
 Blood ammonia concentration can help identify patients with hepatic encephalopathy.
 Results of hepatic laboratory testing must be evaluated in the light of the clinical picture and cannot be used in isolation to assess 
 patients with suspected liver disease.

 Key Facts
■ Serum amylase and lipase activity are not useful for the diagnosis of feline pancreatitis
Serum amylase and lipase activities have limited clinical value for the diagnosis of canine pancreatitis and the diagnosis must be
verified by other means.
 Serum PLi concentration is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for pancreatitis in both dogs and cats.
 Serum TLl concentration remains the test of choice for EPl in dogs and cats.

 Key Facts
 A breed predilection is commonly observed for gastrointestinal disorders in dogs, but less commonly in cats, suggesting a hereditary
 nature or effect in the pathogenesis of these diseases.
 To date the only molecular-based diagnostic test available for the diagnosis of inherited gastrointestinal disorders in dogs or cats 
is for copper hepatotoxicosis in the Bedlington Terrier.
 Major advances are to be expected in this field and new diagnostic tests for hereditary gastrointestinal diseases should be available
in the near future.

The mucosa just inside the pylorus can be difficult to examine,
especially when disease causing mucosal swelling, such as an
ulcer, is present. After entering the pylorus, the duodenum
immediately turns to the right (from the perspective of the
image on the screen). To find the duodenal lumen, it some-
times helps to back up the tip of the scope a millimeter or two
 while insufflating with air. Once the duodenal lumen is locat-
ed, the operator should advance the scope as far as possible
into the duodenum, keeping the lumen in the center of the
field of vision. Due to the friable nature of the duodenum, it
is especially important to visualize the entire circumference of
the duodenal mucosa as the scope is being advanced. One
should always remember that it is easy to create artifacts (i.e.,
linear erosions) by pushing the tip of the endoscope against
the duodenal mucosa (Figure 1.47).

It is important to biopsy the antrum, greater curvature, lesser

sarmples of each area are desirable. If an obvious lesion (e.g.
ulcer, mass, erosion, or discolored area) is found, it should be 
biopsied first so that bleeding from other biopsy sites does not
obscure the primary lesion. Biopsies from such lesions should
be placed into a separate formalin container. If an ulcer is

forceps for collecting colonic mucosal biopsies are those where
the small upper punch fits into a larger lower cup and cuts the
tissue much like a pair of scissors rather than the “double
spoon" type (Figure 1.53).
For rectal lesions with a dense submucosal infiltrate (e.g.)
scirrhous carcinomas),it is imperative to biopsy the underly-
ing submucosa and not just the overlying mucosa. In order
to collct these tissue samples, heavy, rigid forceps with the
 shearing action described above are necessary (Figure 1.54).
It can be very difficult to sample a densely infiltrated submu-
cosa and it sometimes works best if the scope is removed
from the anus, and a gloved finger guides the forceps to the
thickest part of the lesion.The opened jaws of the forceps are

must be inspected after removal from the forceps. If the pres-
ence of submucosa is not obvious the biopsy must be re-
 peated.
1.5.7.2
 Mounting and handling tissue samples
 Itis critical that the clinician consults with the pathologist to
establish how the samples are to be submitted, and how the
lab will process the samples. In particular, duodenal samples
 are very difficult to get embedded correctly, but are often the
samples most likely to provide valuable information. The au-
thor places tissue samples on a non-absorbent, plastic sponge
that fits into the histopath cassette.14,15 Duodenal and ileal
samples are oriented such that the submucosal side of the
sample is on the sponge and the viliare pointing away from
the sponge (Figure 1.55). It is crucial to not allow the tissue
samples to dry out. The sponges with the attached tissue
samples are placed upside down in formalin and submitted to
the laboratory. The laboratory ermbeds these samples in paraf-
fin by turning them 90 degrees so that they will be sectioned
longitudinally. This should enable the pathologist to see a
well-oriented section of mucosa from the villus tips to the
 junction of the mucosa and muscularis mucosa (Figure 1.56).
 For gastric and colonic mucosal samples, it does not matter
which side is against the sponge. However, care must be taken
not to stretch colonic or gastric mucosa when placing it on 
the sponge.

that some submucosa is included. Not all endoscopic biopsies are as high-quality
 as the one shown, butitshould bethe aim of the clinician and pathologist that at

Esophagus
Although endoscopy may help to detect a grossly distended
esophagus (i.e., megaesophagus), endoscopy is often a poor
diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of esophageal weakness.?
Only patients with marked esophageal dilation will be ob-
yious during endoscopy;fluoroscopy is a much more sensitive
(and les invasive) way to diagnose esophageal weakness.Also,
some preanesthetics (e.g., ketamine or xylazine) can cause the
esophagus, stomach, and intestines to become flaccid.18

to stage the extent of neoplastic conditions of the abdominal
cavity? Laparoscopy may reveal small (0.5 cm or less) meta-
static lesions, peritoneal metastases, or other organ involve-
ment not easily observed by other techniques.An unexplained
abdominal effusion is anotherindication forlaparoscopy when
other diagnostic modalities used to determine the cause are
formed using laparoscopic assistance. Other ancillary diagnos-
tic techniques using laparoscopic guidance include gallbladder
aspiration (cholecystocentesis), and splenoportography. 
 The advantages of laparoscopy over a conventional surgical
laparotomy include improved patient recovery because of
smaller surgical sites, lower postoperative morbidity and de-
creased infection rate, postoperative pain, and hospitalization
time. Other less obvious benefits of laparoscopy are related to
fewer stress mediated factors than do occur with surgery.4

be confused with intra-cytoplasmic bile pigment (Figure 1.97).
Differentiation of various cytoplasmic abnormalities may be
achieved using a variety of different stains (Table 1.14).48 Due
to the fact that hepatic cirrhosis is characterized by structural
changes (lobular structure, fibrosis, and areas of reconstruction
and regeneration), this condition can not be diagnosed based
on liver cytology?9 10 Occasionally microorganisms can be ob-
served on FNA cytology (Figure 1.98).

ities need to be distinguished from an inflammatory process.
 Inflammation is characterized by the presence of numerous
neutrophils, which frequently are degenerated, macrophages,
and necrotic material. Inflammation also leads to slight dys-
 plasia of pancreatic cells (Figure 1.99). However, it should be
noted that pancreatitis is frequently localized, and a negative 
 result of single FNA does not rule out the presence of pan-
creatitis.
102 Diagnostic Tools
Malignant neoplasia is characterized by the presence of so-
called criteria of malignancy: anisokaryosis, pleomorphic cells,
and excessive cellularity.A poorly differentiated pancreatic car-
cinoma is easy to diagnose (Figure 1.100). However, malignant
tumors lead to extensive secondary inflammation, which makes
the diagnostic differentiation of pancreatitis and pancreatic car-
cinoma by cytology extremely difficult, especially in cases
where the pancreatic cells exhibit only a slight dysplasia with
concurrent inflammation. In addition to primary tumors, me-
tastatic tumors can also be diagnosed in the pancreas based on
FNA cytology. Cysts und pseudocysts are characterized by the
 presence of encapsulated fluid that contains only few cells.5

 phils can be observed in patients with eosinophilic colitis or

with other inflammatory disorders. In rare cases, neoplasia can
 be diagnosed based on a rectal scraping. Rectal scraping is
considered most useful for the diagnosis of infectious orga-
nisms, such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus neoformans,
Prototheca, Pentatrichomonas hominis, Balantidium coli, and Enta-
moeba histolytica.11.12
FNA cytology of masses of the gastrointestinal tract that are
discovered during ultrasonographic examination and impres-
sion smears of endoscopically obtained biopsy specimens can
be useful for the identification of infectious organisms or the
diagnosis of neoplasia (Figures 1.101-1.104).
 Key Facts
 Fine-needle aspiration rarely leads to complications.
 Tumors of the gastrointestinal tract can often be diagnosed based on cytology.
 Degenerative hepatic disease often displays characteristic cytological features.
■ Hepatitis and hepatic cirrhosis cannot be accurately diagnosed based on cytology alone.
 In some cases microorganisms can be identified on cytology.

 Key Facts
■
 Gastrointestinal motility disorders are important causes of gastrointestinal signs (e. g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal dis.
comfort, and constipation) in dogs and cats.
Gastrointestinal motility disorders may involve the esophagus (e.g., idiopathic megaesophagus), stomach (e.g., delayed gastric
emptying), intestine (e. g., ileus or pseudo-obstruction), or colon (e.g., constipation), independently, or as a more generalized and 
diffuse gastrointestinal motility disorder (e g., dysautonomia).
■
Gastrointestinal motility may be assessed by a number of different methods including survey and contrast radiography, ultrasono-
 graphy, nuclear scintigraphy, tracer studies, manometry, and MRI (Table 1. 17).

120 Clinical Evaluation of Dogs and Cats with Specific Clinical Signs
 Key Facts
 In cases with mild clinical signs, the diagnostic evaluation may be limited, and patients may require only outpatient symptomatic
care.
■
In animals with severe clinical signs, there may be severe electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, and a more thorough evaluation
and in-patient care may be necessary.
It is critical to distinguish vomiting versus regurgitation when obtaining the initial history, because the diagnostic and treatment 
 approaches are vastly different.
 Acute vomiting and diarrhea can be caused by gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal causes.
 Acute diarrhea is often self-limiting and may or may not require treatment. Often the etiology remains unknown.

 Key Facts
 A thorough history and physical examination can be extremely helpful for the assessment of patients with chronic vomiting.
 Hyperthyroidism and heartworm disease can cause chronic vomiting in cats.
 Hypoadrenocortism can mimic many other diseases and should always be considered in cases of chronic vomiting, especialy, but
not exclusively, in patients with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.
 Endoscopy is very useful and cost effective for the evaluation of chronic vomiting after secondary causes of vomiting have been
ruled out.
 A common presenting clinical sign of dogs and cats with inflammatory bowel disease is chronic intermittent vomiting.

In order to monitor the progress in a patient with chronic diarrhea, it is important that the pet owner daily evaluates the consistency
 of the feces using a fecal scoring system.
 Diet-related diarrhea should be excluded before treatment trials with drugs are initiated.
 Tylosin can be effective in resolving chronic diarrhea in dogs.

The esophagus is the connection between the oropharynx and
the stomach; the major function of which is to carry ingested
material from the oral cavity to the stomach.The esophagus is
divided into a cervical, thoracic, and abdominal portion. It
begins at the upper esophagea sphincter (pharyngoesophageal
sphincter), which is comprised of the cricopharyngeus and
thyropharyngeus muscles. The cervical portion of the esoph-
agus lies dorsally and to the left of the trachea. The thoracic
 portion of the esophagus extends from the thoracic inlet to
the diaphragmatic hiatus. It lies dorsal to the trachea at the
carina, where it then crosses the midline and lies to the right 
 of the aortic arch. From here,it lies very close to the median

2Esophagitis
Esophagitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory disorder of
the esophageal mucosa. If severe, esophageal inflammation
 may extend into the submucosal and muscular layers. Esoph-
agitis can result from ingestion of corrosive or caustic sub-
stances, foreign body obstruction, thermal burns, infectious
agents, persistent vomiting, and probably most commonly, gas-

Esophageal diverticula
An esophageal diverticulum is a pouch-like dilation of the
 esophageal wall. Diverticula may be congenital or acquired
 and are of two types, pulsion or traction diverticula. Pulsion
diverticula represent an outpouching of the esophageal mu-
cosa through a defect in the muscular and adventitial layers of
the esophagus.3745 It is usually acquired secondary to increased
intraluminal pressure and deep esophageal inflammation. Pre-
disposing disorders include esophagitis, esophageal stricture or
foreign body orhiatal herniaTraction diverticula are gener-
ally acquired as a result of inflammation in the thoracic cavity
in close proximity to the esophagus. This leads to the forma-
 tion of fibrous tissue, which then contracts pulling the esopha-
geal wll outwards This type of diverticulum affects l four
layers of the esophageal wall and most commonly occurs sec-
ondary to a foreign body perforation. Both types have been
reported in the dog while only one case of an esophageal di-

usually show a diffusely dilated esophagus filled with air, food,

for congenital or acquired idiopathic forms of megaesophagus,
and these patients should be treated with supportive care. As-
piration pneumonia should be treated as it arises. Dietary sup-
port should be provided in form of a high quality, high calorie
diet either via frequent, mall upright feedings or through a

thought to be mainly due to decreased venous return. Survey
radiographs are usually diagnostic showing a sof tissue mass in
the distal esophagus and a dilated proximal esophagus (Fig-

Histopathology
Many histological types of primary esophageal tumors have
been described, including squamous cel carcinoma, adeno-
squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of the esophageal
glands, neuroendocrine carcinoma, plasma cell tumor, and
 osteosarcoma.1-1 Benign esophageal tumors such as leiomy-
oma have been reported in the dog.12-13 Secondary esopha-
geal tumors originate from locally invasive tumors such as
thyroid carcinoma or gastric carcinoma, or via distant metas-
tasis.1.14 In one study, tumors metastatic to the esophagus were

Key Facts
 Esophageal tumors are rare in both dogs and cats.
 Tumors metastatic to the esophagus are more common than primary esophageal tumors.
■
 Spirocerca lupi is a known cause of esophageal tumors in dogs.
Clinical signs are most frequently related to esophageal obstruction.

Stomach

Introduction 
snpun
The stomach is a muscular and glandular organ with its main
functions being the storage,mechanical andenzymatic process-
 ing, and transportation of partially digested food into the small

intestine.The muscular action of the stomach causes mechan-
ical breakdown of food boluses into smaller particles, facilitat-
ing duodenal digestion and absorption.The glandular portion
 of the stomach produces gastric acid, pepsinogen (the precur-
sor of the proteolytic enzyme pepsin), gastric lipase, and sev-
eral hormones that play an important role in gastric acid secre-
tion. Chemical and enzymatic digestion, particularly of

small intestine for fiurther digestion. Only a few substances

. Key Facts
■ Mechanical and enzymatic digestion of food is initiated in the stomach.
 The gastric mucosa contains several glands that secrete various secretory products including hydrochloric acid, pepsin, mucus,
gastrin, and intrinsic factor in dogs.
Gastric acid seretion occurs in response to stimulation of histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine receptor.
 The gastric mucosal barrier protects the stomach from damage by gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes.

4.4.1.2.3 Hypertrophic gastritis
Chronic hypertrophic gastritis is a rare disorder that appears
either as diffuse, generalized mucosal hypertrophy or, more
frequently, as a localized hypertrophy of the antral mucosa that
may cause intermittent or chronic pyloric obstruction. Causa-
clude chronic inflammation, foreign bodies, or long-term use
of proton pump inhibitors. Hypergastrinemia can also have a
trophic effect on the mucosa, as seen in chronic renal disease,
chronic gastric distension, gastrin-secreting tumors (gastri-
noma), and idiopathic hypertrophy of antral G cells. Boxers
and Basenjis have a predilection for the diffuse form of hyper-
trophic gastritis In contrast, the localized form has a predilec-
tion for miniature and toy dog breeds (e.g., Lhasa Apso, Mal-
tese, Pekingese, and Shih Tzu). The hypertrophic mucosa is
inflamed and causes delayed emptying, chronic vomiting, ano-
 rexia, and lethargy.
4.4.1.2.4 Atrophic gastritis
Atrophic gastritis is a rare disorder in which the gastric mucosa
atrophies and loses its secretory functions. Atrophic gastritis
has been reported in the Norwegian Lundehund. The cause is
unknown, but the condition occurs mainly in older dogs and
may be mediated through the immune system. Atrophic gas-
tritis may also be a sequel to chronic reflux gastritis in dogs.

4.4.1.2.7 Treatment of chronic gastritis
If possible, the underlying cause of the gastric inflammation
should be managed first (e.g., removal of foreign body, cessa-
tion of drug administration). Diagnosis of infestation with a
stomach worm (i.e., Physaloptera spp. in dogs and Olulanus
tricuspis in cats) maybe challenging and routine therapy with a
broad-spectrum anthelminthic agent that is effective in eradi-
cating stomach worms (i.e., in dogs: pyrantel pamoate at
15 mg/kg PO repeated in 2-3 weeks; in cats: fenbendazole at
50 mg/kg PO q 24 h for 3 days) is prudent before recom-
mending more expensive diagnostic tests.27 However, most
cases of chronic gastritis are idiopathic and treatment of the
underlying cause is thus rarely posible In cases of idiopathic
chronic gastritis, rational treatrment options include dietary
management, immunosuppressive therapy, inhibition or neu-
tralization of gastric acid secretion (see 4.4.1.3; Table 4.1;
Figure 4.12:

 In dogs with gastric dilation-volvulus (GDV), aggressive intravenous fluid therapy should be initiated before the stomach is decom-

Radiography
 In some patients with gastric tumors, the survey radiographs
may be normal. Abnormal findings include excessive fluid or
gas in the stomach despite fasting.3 A mass or caudal displace-
ment of the gastric axis on the lateral radiograph has been
described in dogs with gastric tumors.2
The use of contrast agents facilitates the radiographic visuali-
zation of gastric wall thickening, distortion of the gastric lu-
 men, presence of a filling defect, and derangement of the rugal
folds caused by tumor infiltration. While the normal gastric
emptying time is not well defined, delayed emptying is
common with gastric tumors.23 The stomach may also appear
rigid and non-distensible, which is termed *linitis plastica”" or

however, a biopsy is required to make a definitive diagnosis and to determine if the tumor is benign or malignant.

 Key Facts
■Physiological regulation of the intestine involves complex interactions between the endocrine, neural, and immune systems that are
 specific to the intestine.
 The villus is the functional unit of the small intestine. Diseases affecting the villus are associated with diarrhea and malab-
sorption.
 The gastrointestinal microflora plays an integral part in normal intestinal physiology.

 Key Facts
 Important viral infections that can cause primary intestinal disease are canine parvovirosis and canine distemper in unvaccinated
■ Helminthic parasite infections are common in both dogs and cats. Ancylostoma and ascarids can cause significant disease in small 
 animals.
■
 Many enteropathogenic bacteria can be isolated from the feces of healthy dogs and cats and when such pathogens are found in
the feces in animals with diarrhea, it is often diffiult to distinguish primary infections from opportunistic secondary infections.
■
 Many bacterial infections in the gut are selflimiting and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics is not advised.
Although dogs and cats do not appear to play a central role i the epidemiology of gastrointestinal infections in humans, caution
is warranted when pets, shedding potential bacterial or protozoal pathogens, have close contact with immune-compromised indi-
viduals.

 Key Facts
■ PLE can result from any disease that causes increased mucosal permeability, mucosal ulceration, or altered lymphatic drainage.
■Most dogs and cats with PLE have diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss, although some dogs with PLE do not exhibit these clinical
signs.
■
 Most affected animals have panhypoproteinemia, but some patients may only have hypoalbuminemia
 Care should be taken to exclude other causes of hypoalbuminemia: hepatic failure, glomerular disease, blood loss, and severe exu-
dative skin disease.
 Prompt diagnosis and treatment of PLE is important because affected animals with severe hypoalbuminemia can deteriorate rapidly
and develop life-threatening complications.

Introduction
Small intestinal (SI) neoplasia is uncommon, noted in 0.3%
and 0.7% of all canine and feline necropsy submissions,respec-
tively, each year. Of the non-lymphoid SI tumors (see 9.3
for lymphoid tumors), carcinomas predominate in both spe-

lesion is tubular in nature and causes annular narrowing of the bowel noted by a
white band of constriction (arrow).
Incidence

the intestinal tract, most canine non-lymphoid intestinal tu-

Physical examination findings may aid in the diagnosis, as a
palpable mass is found in approximately half of all cases.23.20
Plain radiographs are generallylessensitiv than palpation or

 Dogs with intestinal smooth muscle tumors may present for signs related to hypoglycemia, rather than for obvious gastrointestinal 
signs.
 Ultrasonography is recommended for the identification of intestinal masses and may permit differentiation of neoplasia from non-

 Canine intestinal mast cell tumor warrants a poor prognosis and generally affects miniature breeds, especially the Maltese.

Colitis
Acute and chronic colonic inflammation (colitis) commonly
results in large bowel diarrhea in dogs and cats. Signs of colitis
include excess fecal mucus, hematochezia, tenesmus,increased
frequency of defecation, and reduced volume of feces per def-
 ecation.Vomiting, anorexia, dehydration, and abdominal pain 
 may also be observed. With concurrent small bowel involve-
ment, melena and weight loss (chronic cases only) may also
occur.
Acute colitis is most commonly caused by dietary indiscretion
 or intolerance (see 9.1), toxin or foreign body ingestion, drug
 administration (antibiotics or NSAIDs), whipworm infesta-

described in that study was characterized by acute hemor-
rhagic diarrhea, hematemesis, severe dehydration, and necro-
tizing hemorrhagic enteritis and mesenteric lymphadenopa-

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is confirmed by identifying the enterotoxin in
the feces from a dog or cat with typical clinical signs, which
lack evidence of another large bowel disease.The clinical signs
should rapidly improve following antibiotic administration.
The only test currently available is a qualitive ELISA (Tech-
6
Lab, Blacksburg, VA).The test is available through some com-
mercial diagnostic laboratories. In animals with intermittent
signs, fecal samples should be collected when diarrhea is
 present, as the enterotoxin may not be found during asympto-
matic periods. There is some suspicion that refrigeration may
lead to unreliable results.41
In the past, it has been suggested that diagnosis of this entero-

Dietary fiber is a collective term for a wide variety of plant
 polysaccharides and lignins that are resistant to mammalian

each with diverse chermical, physical, and physiological prop-
erties. Water-soluble fibers include pectin, gums, mucilages,
and some hermicelluloses.30 They are found in the parenchy-
matous portions of fruits and vegetables, and in the seeds of
leguminous plants. Water-insoluble fibers include cellulose,

lignin,and some hemicelluloses, and are found in cereal grains
and seed coats.
Dietary fiber supplermentation has been shown to normalize

leads to fulminant hepatitis.The author has not been able to
identify high titers against CAV1 in most dogs with chronic
hepatitis. It is also likely that there are other viruses that can
cause chronic hepatitis in dogs. However, the lymphocytic
and plasmacytic inflammation and the good response to im-
munosuppressive drugs indicate that a self-perpetuating auto-
immune process plays a role in chronic hepatitis.
Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis may also be due to chemicals
or toxins (e.g., aflatoxin). Metabolic alterations in the liver,
 primarily inherited copper toxicosis, also can lead to damage

Management
The most important goal of the management of feline patients
with hepatic lipidosis is to get them out of their catabolic state
and to supply the amino acids essential to prevent further fat
accumulation and development of HE. Complete nutritional
support along with treatment of known concurent and pos-
recovery.o Feding via a nasoesophageal or gastric tube is
necessary if the cat is unable to be fed orally It is essential to
choose a high protein diet as cats with hepatic lipidosis cannot
metabolize fat or carbohydrates efficiently. Severely affected
cats are first stabilized by attending to their fluid and electro-
lyte needs (i.e., potassium is usually low, and hypokalermia is a
risk factor for HE) During this time,nutritional support can
be provided via a nasoesophageal or nasogastric tube with a
liquid enteral diet, such as CliniCare Feline Liquid Diet (Ab-
bott Laboratories, North Chicago,IL).The use of a large bore
 Pezzer mushroom-tip tube (Bard urological catheter, Bard

Exocrine Pancreas
JORG M. STEINER
8.1
Anatomy
The pancreas in dogs and cats is a long narrow structure that
can be divided into a right and a left limb. In between these
two limbs is the head of the pancreas, which, in contrast to
humans, is not an easily discernible structure in dogs (Fig-
ure 8.1) and cats. The right limb of the pancreas lies directly
next to the duodenum, while the left limb is situated next to
the spleen. The pancreas is made up of lobules of pancreatic
tissue, which in turn are made up of acinar cells (Figure 8.2).
In between the lobules there are the islets of Langerhans (Fig-
ure 8.2), which are collections of neuroendocrine cells.These
 neuroendocrine cells make up the endocrine portion of the
8
 pancreas and synthesize and secrete a variety of regulatory
polypeptides, most importantly insulin and glucagon.The aci-
nar celis produce digestive enzymes and zymogens, which are

major duodenal papilla together with the common bile duct.
University of Tennessee, USA.)
The lumen of the pancreatic duct is separated from the duo-
denum by the sphincter of Oddi, which is a muscular sphinc-
ter that is essential in preventing duodenal contents from en-
tering the pancreatic duct. Dogs and approximately 20% of
cats have a second pancreatic duct, the accessory pancreatic
duct (ductus pancreaticus accessorius) that empties on the
minor duodenal papilla, approximately 1-3 crm distal to the
major duodenal papilla into the duodenum.
Table 8.1: Secretory products of the exocrine pancreas
This table shows alist of secretory products of the exocrine pancreas and their
main functions. There are three types of secretory products: zymogens of pancreatic
 digestive enzymes, pancreatic enzymes, and other molecules that are neither.

Pancreatic biopsy
Traditionally, a pancreatic biopsy has been viewed as the most
definitive diagnostic tool for pancreatitis. Pancreatic biopsies
can be collected during abdominal exploratory or by laparo-
scopy The presence of pancreatitis is easily diagnosed by the
gros appearance of the pancreas in many cases; however, the
absence of pancreatitis can be difficult to prove. In a recent
study, histopathological findings in dogs with pancreatitis were
evaluated.The pancreata were sectioned every 2 cm11 In half

found in less than 25% of all the sections. 1 Thus, even if mul-

Etiology
 The most common cause of EPI in the classical sense,that is the
lack of exocrine pancreatic tissue, is pancreatic acinar atrophy
(PAA), which is almost exclusively seen in German Shepherd

 Key Facts
■
 Pancreatitis occurs frequently in both dogs and cats and is the most common disease of the exocrine pancreas in both species.
 Pancreatitis can range in severity and can be subclinical or severe. Severe pancreatitis is associated with both local and systemic
 complications.
saued ioi pads Aueu si punosen eupe paldde ane ean uahus uau
 Serum PLl concentration (Spec cPLTM in dogs and fPLl in cats) is both highly specific and sensitive for pancreatitis in small
■
 animals.
 Treatment of dogs and cats with pancreatitis is dependant on the severity of the disease and may include treatment of the under-
ying cause, if identified, supportive care, analgesia, antiemetics, nutritional support, plasma, and treatment of concurrent condi-
 tions. Also, patients with chronic pancreatitis may benefit from corticosteroid administration.

The underlying etiology of idiopathic IBD in small animals is,

 to IBD in humans and the breakdown of immunological tol-

is thought to be crucial in the pathogenesis of this disorder.3

 Key Facts
'sien pue shop u eauuieip jo pue bujwon juoiup jo asnen uowwon e s! dal
 Idiopathic IBD is diagnosed on the basis of histological evidence of inflammation and no identifiable underlying cause.
 The etiology of IBD is hypothesized to be a breakdown in mucosal tolerance to the normal enteric flora.
■
 Clinical signs of IBD reflect the type of inflammation, its anatomical site,its severity, and its chronicity.
■ The mainstay of treatment of IBD is immunosuppression.

(lymphoblastic, immunoblastic, or large cell), and intermediate

different studies.

 Key Facts
 Gastrointestinal lymphoma is a common cause of anorexia and weight loss in older cats, with or without vomiting and /or di-
arrhea.
Most cats with Gl lymphoma are FelV and FIV negative.
 Low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma in cats may be more common than previously thought and appears to be more responsive 
to chemotherapy than high-grade lymphoma.
 The most significant prognostic indicator for gastrointestinal lymphoma in catsis the initial response to chemotherapy, with patients

matic. Most dogs diagnosed with an insulinoma will present
with a low blood glucose concentration, even in the absence
 of clinical signs. If hypoglycemia is confirmed, the causative
relationship between the observed clinical signs and the hy-
 poglycemia needs to be established.This is best accomplished
by demonstrating Whipple's triad, which consists of 1) dem-
onstrating a subnormal blood glucose concentration, 2) pres-
ence of clinical signs of hypoglycemia, and 3) cessation of
clinical signs with resolution of hypoglycemia. AferWhipple's
triad has been established, the cause of hypoglycemia must be
identified. A basic workup should include a complete blood
count, a chemistry profile, and a urinalysis. In insulinoma pa-
tients these basic parameters will usually be within normal
limits. Infrequently reported abnormalities include mild eleva-
tions in liver enzymes. Radiographs of the thorax and abdo-
men are usually within normal limits, but may be helpful to

 Key Facts
■ Insulinoma is the most common NET in dogs, followed by gastrinoma. All other NETs of the Gl tract are extremely rare in dogs
All Gl NETs are extremely rare in cats.
 An insulinoma should be suspected in a patient with hypoglycemia with an increased serum insulin concentration.
■
Insu linomas are ultimately malignant in most dogs. However, many dogs can be successfully managed for more than 1 year.
 Localization of NETs of the Gl tract can be challenging.
