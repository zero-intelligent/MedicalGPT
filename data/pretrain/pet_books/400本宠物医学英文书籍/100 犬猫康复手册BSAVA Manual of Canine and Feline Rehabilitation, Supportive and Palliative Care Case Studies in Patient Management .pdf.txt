This BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Rehablitation,Supportive

pet health andwellness.The manual is truly unique-it brings together
theprinciples of pain management,nutrition,physical therapies,
rehabilitationand acupuncture and shows thereadershow these can
all be practically used to support the whole spectrum of veterinary
patients.There is no other book that does this,and BSAVA is tobe
congratulated forsupporting thedevelopmentof thismanual.

Nutritional management of liver disease
The liver is central to the metabolism of protein,
carbohydrate,lipid,vitamins and minerals,and
therefore diet is important in both the cause and
treatment of liver disease in dogs and cats.The liver
also has an important detoxifying role,including the
detoxification of the contents of the portal blood
(such as ammonia from glutamine metabolism by
enterocytes and from colonicbacterial activity).Cats
have very different metabolism and liver diseases
from dogs,so their dietary requirements in hepatic
diseases are also very different from dogs.

Exercise
Exercise （Figure 8.5)has positive effects on wellbe-
ing,mood,musculoskeletal strength and muscle
tone,immunomodulation and sleep regulation.At
least some of these effects are mediatedby endor-
phins and anyphysical therapy that mimics exercise
will almost certainlyproduce some of its effectsby
this mechanism.

Exercisehas numerous positive efects and is
fun.
Hydrotherapy (see Chapter 1o)allows thepatient
to exercise:by fairly vigorous exertion,in the case of
swimming:or by moving the limbs through a normal
range of motion for ambulation on an underwater
treadmill.As well as the usual recognized benefits
on muscle tone and bulk,avoidance of concussion
on the joints,normal movementof the joints and the
consumption of calories,the simple benefits of
exercising per se are likely to havepositive effects

Tightness isa mild shortening ofamuscle and
has no specificpathology.lt is commonly found in
muscles that cross two joints (such as biceps brachil
and rectus femoris muscles). Stretching exercises
can usuallyrestore length to tight muscles.
Contracture is the significant shortening of the
muscles and/or other soft tissues around a joint,
causing a limit to the joint's range of motion.
Contracture is often due to scar tissue,adhesions

Heatand cold therapies
Heat and cold are simple and effective modalities
used in the treatment and rehabilitation of animals.
However, their successful use requires a proper
assessment of the problems encountered and the
effects required (appropriate to the stage of the
inflammatory processreached;Heinrichs,2004)
Cold should be used in the acute stages of
inflammation(during the first2-3days).
Heat is used subsequent to this(days4-5
onwards),once the acute phase isover.

Special considerations
Physiotherapy for cats
In general terms,cats are more protective of their
injuries than dogs and,because of their ighter bulk
injured limbs.Although the principles and tech-
niques of physiotherapy described in this chapter
are applicable to all species, the feline patient is
generally less tolerant of the regular handling
involved in physiotherapeutic care than are most
canine patients and is less accepting of new activi-
ties,therefore,modification of techniques and their
application may be required.In cats,the tolerance,
and therefore benefits,of leash walking and hydro-
therapy are restricted to just a few individuals.To
achieve satisfactory results,treatment sessions with
cats should be kept short,exercises introduced
more gradually,and items famiiar to the cat, such

will increase the amount of drag and consequently,
the amount of work that has to be done by the
patient,without having to increase the length of a

Surface tension
The surface tension of water means that the
resistance to working at the surface of the water is
greater.In practice,thismeans that exercises at the
surfaceof thewater aremore difficult.When working

of the draining fluid:the presence of intracellular bacteria and toxic or degenerate neutrophils would suggest
ongoing active infection.Following removal of the drain,the exit wound should be left to heal by second

Care of feeding tube
Thispatientwill require an Elizabethan collarwhen left unattended,to avoid interferencewith her gastrostomy
tube.Care must be taken to ensure that thecollar doesnot interferewith the surgical wound.
The feeding tube will need careful monitoring:the majority of complications involve tube occlusion or
localized irritation at the tube exit site. Serious complications such as infection, tube dislodgement and
clogging(see Chapter5).
The dressings andbandagescovering the feeding tube should be inspected daily for signs of infection and
the site cleaned.Bodyweight shouldbemonitored daily forpatientsreceiving enteral nutritional support.

Nutritional requirements
Importance of early postoperative feeding
Nutritional support of dogs following major surgery can be challenging. In the short term,it is Important to
ensure the dog eatswhile hospitalized.He shouldbe fed as soon as possible after surgery(within24hours） to
facilitate healing. Contrary to previous ideas,early feeding does not increase the risk of rectal suture
breakdown andperitonitis.Infact,it is very much thereverse:intraluminal nutrition isneeded to allow effective
gut wall healing;and thegiant migrating motility complexes'of the gut associatedwith fastingwillbe likelyto
put more strain on the sutures than the smaller postprandial peristaitic waves.However,in this dog it is
important tochoosealow-residuedietpostoperatively toreduce thebulkof thefaecesinthecolonandrectum.
The inclusion of some fermentable(soluble) fibre iswise to provide nutrition for the healing colonocytes.
Lactulose isa suitable soluble fibre for postoperative use andwillalso make the faeces softer. lt should be
titrated to effect to produce two or three soft defecations a day-err on the conservative side to start with,as

Ldoo
A 4-year-old neutered male Husky in ideal body condition,who was used for sled racing,was
presented with wound breakdown over the medial aspectof theright stifle.Two weekspreviously he
had undergone wide surgical excision of an intermediate-grade cutaneous mast cell tumour.
Histopathology had confirmed complete tumour excision.Debridement and resuturing of the wound
had been unsuccessful in treating the complication.
Agreed medical/suryical management
OnDay1 thewoundwas lavaged and debridedand all suturematerial
removed.Awet-to-dry dressing was tied into the wound. Culture ofa
swab from the wound prior to lavage revealed a scanty growth of a
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus,sensitive to a range of antibiotics.
Culture of the woundafter lavage on Day 1 was negative.The wound
was then lavaged,debrided andredressed daily for 7 days（under
sedationwith medetomidine andan opioid)until ahealthybedof gran-
ulation tissue was achieved.The dog was treatedwith oral amoxicillin/
clavulanate initially,pending cultureresults.This treatmentwas discon-

Management of a urinary catheter
Whilst the cat is in the hospital,whether catheterized or not,
urine should be monitoreddaily for changes in odour and
colour. lf there is an indwelling urinary catheter,it should be

and emptying the urine bag,gloves should be worn and an
aseptic technique employed.
It isbestnot to useprophylactic antibioticsinanimalswith
indwelling urinary catheters becauseof the riskof resistant
infections (see Chapter 18). However, the urine should be
monitored carefully for evidence of infection (urine dipsticks can
be used to check protein content and to detect blood). The

Postoperative nutritional requirements have not been cemonstrated to differ from those ofnormal dogs and
therefore alterations to diet may not be necessary.Ahigh-quality easily digestible diet would be most
appropriate.However,if the stress and analgesic drugsmake the dog anorexic,encouraging him to eat with his

A 4-year-old neutered male Labrador Retriever was
presented with a rapidly growing mandibular mass,
which was beginning to interfere with his ability to eat.
He had a bouncy vivacious temperament and was in
normal body condition (bodyweight 34kg).
An incisional biopsy was performed under general
anaesthetic and a fibrosarcoma was confirmed. The
clinical stage of the disease is defined by its local and
systemic extent. Local disease extent canbe
determined,toan acceptable degree,by local
radiography or CT examination.Local regional lymph

and creatinine (162 μmol/l;reference range 44.0-159.0).
Total serum calcium was 4.03 mmol/l (reference range

Careful examination revealed a small mass in the
ment of the sublumbar lymph nodes but no visible lung
metastases.A diagnosis of anal sac carcinoma was
made on cytological evaluation of fine needle aspirates
from the anal sac mass.
The increased abdominal effort on defecation and the
production of small faecoliths may indicate weakness of
the smooth muscleof the colon and rectum.
Radiography showed sublumbarlymphnode enlargement.
Thiswas due tometastasis from theprimaryanal sacgland

Appetite stimulation
Anecdotally,acupuncture has been used to stimulate appetite in anorexic cats; this may be via its effects on
feelings of nausea,or via some other mechanism （experimental workin rats demonstrates that needling at
ST36,a point in tibialis cranialis,just below the stifle,significantly reduces the production of stomach acid,for
example). Generalized humoral effects such as the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters may
improvegeneral feelingsofcomfort andwellbeing.

Acute/chronicpain management
Acute pain
This is very important in this condition.Opioids should be used initially for acute pain management
Epidural morphine may be useful (see BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Anaesthesia and Analgesia).
Aspirin,if given as an anticoagulant,may also provide some analgesia. Euthanasia should be seriously
considered if pain cannot be adequately controlled.
Once the cat has recovered from the acute pain of the first few days,analgesia with oral transmucosal
buprenorphine (see Chapter 3)may be helpful.
Chronic pain
if the cat isrecovering but still unable to use his hindlimbs,he could strain his backand forelimb muscles by
using them to move about.Secondary muscle pain should therefore be considered as an additional source of
pain and discomfort for this patient.lf aspirin s stillbeing used,this may help.Acupuncture is often well
tolerated and maybebetterindicated for muscle pain,although there isno currently no clinical evidence for this

However,the effectsof thison thepathogenesisof aortic thromboembolism havenotbeen evaluated.
To counteract the muscle-wasting effectsof the sudden-onset bilateral hindlimb paralysis,this cat should
receive regular （three times daily)physiotherapy to maintain joint and muscle range,muscle strength,balance
and proprioception,and joint stablity.The success of this physiotherapy will be very dependent on his

WARNING
Indwelling venous catheters shouldNEVERbe placed into veins of legs devitalizedby occlusive emboll.
Cage rest and monitoring
excessiveexternal warming should be avoided as this mayresult in peripheral vasodilation and shunting of
blood andwarmth away from vitalorgans.
283
Case 16.4 Aortic thromboembolism ina cat
The cat should be monitored for signs of pain:
Vocalizing
Unable to settle
Rolling around
Panting or open-mouth breathing.
Oxygen supplementation may be required (see Chapter 17).
Handling
Care must be taken when handling orrestraining the cat as his limbs are likely to be sore to the touch,
particularly in the early stages.
Dealing with limitedmobility
Assisting thecatinto a standing position for short periods during the day will helppreventpressure soresand
urine scalding.lf he has unilateral or bilateral hindlimb paresis,he will be unable to move around easily.
Absorbent bedding or an incontinence pad should beprovided and the catmonitored regularly for signs of skin
sloughing and toprevent urine scalding.Placement of a urinary catheter should beconsidered earlyon in the
course of treatment.
Without proximal control:（trunk,hip and scapular muscles）,limb movement is often dificult and
uncoordinated.Transition from lateral recumbency into a sternal position may not bepossible and the patient
may require assistance to maintain this position.
Self-mutilation of distal limbs is commonly exhibited during convalescence and is characterized by
excessive licking or chewing of the toes or lateral hock.Application of an Elizabethan collar,loose-fitting

Chroniccoughing is also likely togiverise to secondary muscle pain from the intercostal and other thoracic
muscles,as well as exacerbating any concurrent muscle strain in,for example, the lumbar or abdominal
muscles.The patient should be assessed to determine as far as possible howmuch his patellar problem is
affecting him,and treatment devised accordingly.

Acute/chronic pain management
Chronic pain
The oedema maybepainful,depending on the extent.The dog should behandled especially considerately and
pain relief may be required.Since NSAIDs are contraindicated by the renal disease,paracetamol +codeine
may be used short term until the oedema has improved.
Management of decubital sores (see below) will decrease any associated discomfort.

Hydrotherapy
Generally speaking,thepresence ofopen woundsisa contraindication to hydrotherapy,so the decubital ulcers
will restrict its use in thispatient.

Acupuncture
Treatment of azotaemia-associated nausea
There is good evidence from human studies that acupuncture is helpful in post-chemotherapeutic and
postoperative nausea and vomiting (see Chapter 11). lt is possible,therefore,that it will also help with any
nausea associatedwithazotaemia,which isalso centrally mediated.The mechanism of action is unknown,but
if the dog is feeling nauseous due to azotaemia,is being seen regularly at the clinic and is not distressed by
thesevisits then itwouldbeworth trying some acupuncture tosee if his appetiteanddemeanour improved.The
points chosen could be general and easily accessible points; ST36 may be helpful if tolerated. Safety
considerations would be primarily immunosuppression and the risk of introducing infection with

As in Case 18.6,the most important consideration is to feed the cata moist diet long term to increase water
intake.Thismaysufficeif thepatienthaspreviouslybeenfedonadrydiet.
Various other dietary strategies have been suggested toreduce therecurrence of struvite calcul in cats.
These include:acidifying the urine;reducing dietary magnesium;and reduced relative supersaturation with
struvite.Urinary acidifiers can be added to normal food,but it is important to monitor urine pH to assess
efficacy.Some of the dietarymanipulations thatreduce theriskof struvite formationmay,conversely,increase
theriskof oxalate formation;if possible,the dietshouldbe designed toreduce the riskof both.

use of additional drugs;lidocaine and/orketamine CRl may be very

Traditional nutritional management of puppies with parvoviral enteritis has typically entailed waiting until
early enteral nutrition achieved via naso-oesophageal feeding is well tolerated in such cases.This resulted in a

Acuteseverepancreatitisinadog
A 5-year-old neutered maleYorkshire Terrier was presented after protracted vomiting,in a collapsed
and dehydrated state,with marked abdominal pain and some signs of systemic inflammatory
response,after eating pork fat.The dog was normally fed a diet consisting solely of homemade food
and table scraps,as he refused to eat manufactured petfood.He was in normal to slightly thin body
condition andvery nervous and attached to the owner,a retired elderly lady who spent all her time at
home with him.
Acute severe pancreatitis was diagnosed on the basis of ultrasonographic appearance of the
renal),elevated liver enzymes andneutrophilia.The dog was given anorgan scoreof 2or3,which
represents the number of organs apparently compromised in addition to the pancreas on admission
(see BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Clinical Pathology).This suggested a rather poor prognosis
and the dog wasadmitted to the intensive careunit.

Acute/chronic painmanagement
Acute pain
Acute pancreatitis is associated with pain that can be severe.Treatment involves a staged approach of
that the drugs could not be given orally because of the dog's vomiting, so drugs that could be given
systemicallywere needed.
Pain associatedwith pancreatitis isoftenrefractory to opioids,and canbevery difficult to treat.NSAIDs are
usuallycontraindicated inpancreatitisbecauseof the increasedriskofgastrointestinal andrenal toxicity.Other
options are CRis of lidocaine,ketamine andmedetomidine,either alone or in combination.A combined CRl of
morphine + lidocaine +ketamine (MLK)or a fentanyl CRI may also be used. Epidural morphine may be more

The physiological changes associated with chronic pain are indistinguishable from those of chronic stress
（since pain is a stressor) (see Chapter 3). Behaviourally, changes may include dullness,agitation,sound
sensitivity,panting and trembling,and avoidance of previously accepted stimull.

Weightmanagement
Many dogs with chronic pancreatitis are overweight.Although the link between obesity andpancreatitis is
unclear,it iswise to diet theoverweightpatients.A standardapproach toweightmanagementcanbe followed
(see Chapter 6)but high-fibre weight-loss diets should be usedwith cauition,and withdrawn ifany adverse

Case 19.5
Triaditis'ina cat
A 10-year-old neutered male DSH cat was presented with
diabetes mellitus (DM) that was difficult to control.
The cathad ‘triaditis'（pancreatitis+ inflammatory
bowel disease + chronic cholangitis),which had been
diagnosed by pancreatic,liver and small intestinal biopsy
4years earlier. He was managed with a short course of
steroid therapy and had been on dietary management
since then.
Diabetes was diagnosed 6 months ago and had been
difficult to control because the cat intermittently went off
his food,making the owner worry about how much insulin
to give him.The cat was thin and losing weight.He was fed
a variety of types and amounts of food to try to make him
eat,but there was no consistent plan.The cat has access

the underlying diseasesflare up.
A suitable diabeticregime which might be instituted for thispatient consistsof:

Ruling out and treating any concurrent diseases:not just the triaditis(see below)but also any urinary tract
or other endocrine disease;in anolder cat,ruling out hyperthyroidism and acromegaly areparticularly
important(seeBSAVAManual of CanineandFelineEndocrinology).
Specific considerations for diabetic management with triaditis
Recurrent pancreatitis and cholangitis willcertainlylead toperiodsof diabetic instability.These can be
accepted as long as the cat is stable in between episodes.Acute flare-upsof thepancreas and liver

NSAIDs are contraindicated because of the potential to cause gastrointestinal ulceration and also the high

Fear,stress,conflictconcerns
Since exposure to stressors can precipitate bouts of IBD and also complicate diabetes control,it is important

achieved bymaking his life as predictable and controllable aspossible.In otherwords,any changes inroutine

ideal;as the owner already has quite a lot to deal with in managing this cat,these measures could be

nutritional approaches,it may be useful to prioritize the medical problems that could respond to dietary
changes:
1.Diabetes mellitus

3.IBD and pancreatitis.
Dietary considerations for diabetes
Consistent andreliablefood intake isa priorityin all diabeticpatients.This canbe challenging to achieve in cats

Other considerations include manipulating protein content.In recent studies （e.g.Frank et al,2001) diets
high inprotein and low in carbohydratehavebeen demonstrated to reduce insulinrequirementsand even to
revert some diabetic cats to a non-diabeticstate.However,thismanipulation is more effective in overweight
preserving lean body mass.
Dietary considerations for the liver
High-protein diets areNOT contraindicated with this cat's liver disease.Protein restriction is onlya
biliary tract disease,which typically does not affect liver function. The only consideration with biliary tract
disease is to limit thefatcontent of the diet(asthe associated biliarystasismayreduce fatemulsification).
Dietary considerations for IBD and pancreatitis

A 9-year-old spayed female Labrador Retriever was
presented for investigation of gradual weight loss.She had
previously been overweight.
Significantly elevated liver enzymes were found on a
biochemical blood screen and the liver appeared rather
small and diffusely hyperechoic on ultrasound examina-

Liver biopsy confirmed chronic hepatitis of unknown aeti-
ology. Staining for copper showed no evidence of copper
storage disease.
The dog also had degenerative joint disease (DJD)in the
hips and elbows;without adequate analgesia she refused
to walk and became very stiff.

Case 19.6Chronic hepatitis in a dog
Nutraceuticals for liver disease
Several nutraceuticals are often used in canine chronichepatitis.Veterinary studies have documented reduced
ione precursors such as S-adenosylmethionine (Center et al.,2002).Silymarin (family of active ingredients
from milkthistle)is also oftenusedand hasbeen shown tobeprotective inacute Amanitamushroom toxicity
in dogs (Vogel et al,1984）.There is some evidence also for the efficacy of Vitamin E in chronic hepatitis
(Twedt et al,2003).
Nutraceuticals for DJD
are limited data supporting their use(see Chapter 7).Other more recent strategiesinclude the supplementation
ofomega-3fatty acids,whichmayreduce joint inflammation and thusreducerequirements fornon-steroidal
joint disease.In this case,because of the need to avoid NSAIDs,lt would certainly be worth trying
nutraceuticals as part of the programme of painmanagement for the joints.
Weight management
Usually,in an overweight dog,a careful weight-loss programme is an important part of controlling the pain
associated with theDJD.However,in this patient,the liver disease itself is causing weight loss and so sucha
programmewill not be necessary-or wise.An appropriate diet to support the liver takespriority.
The main physiotherapy involvement would be in respect of DJD in the hips and elbows.The use of heat,
massage,passive movements and stretchescanbe beneficial in improving comfort and mobility (especially in

A 12-week-old female Chihuahua puppy was presented with a
rightmandibularfracture distal to the fourth deciduouspremolar,
caused by a bite from another dog. The puppy had a full set of
deciduous teeth but none ofher permanent teeth had erupted.
The lower jaw had drifted to the right,causing a significant

fed because of pain from the fracture.
Radlography confirmed a fractureof the right mandible.

Agreed medical/surgicalmanagemeni
Immediate ameliorationof the ocular painexperienced by thispatient is essential(seebelow).
The obvious medication to use in cases of dry eye is topical ciclosporin,although the proprietary
preparation is expensive and thiscould bea problem given that thisdog is froma rehoming shelter.Ciclosporin
can be made up in corn oil at much less expense,although thecascade system prevents such use of generic
preparationsand supplyof such a productnot under the cascade system isa contravention of the Veterinary
MedicinesRegulations2008 section IV subsection27.2(a).
Acarbomer-based tearreplacement gel should alsobe applied.
Acute/chronic pain management
Much of the ocularpain from thiscondition probably arises from theiridal and ciliary body spasmoccasioned
by the uveitis.Topical atropine,given twice or three timesdaily.mightbevaluable to ameliorate these noxious
mayoccur.
Longer-term pain relief with topical anaesthetic isnot appropriate as this compromises healing of the
corneal erosion. Topical ketorolacmay be useful,but a small number of cases of corneal stromolysis with
severe destructive stromal melting have been reported with this drug,so frequent evaluation of the eye is
required.Unlike systemic NSAiDs,topical ketorolaccan be used in the presence of systemic corticosteroids.
Thereissome evidence that the topical useof morphine in1%solution can provide analgesiawithout adverse
effects on corneal healing.
The use of systemic corticosteroids should be avoided because they may have a deleterious effect on

Thispatient isinpain and is likely tobe more anxious andreactive than usual.Approach to herheadshould be
preceded by talking to her and by gentle touch.Owners and/or carers should bear in mind that the dog will

A 4-year-old neutered male Labrador Retriever had a history of
non-seasonal pruritus affecting his paws,ventral abdomen,
limbs and face.He also had a history of recurrent otitis externa
and superficial pyoderma.The pruritushad started when he was
18months of age.Due to the non-seasonal nature of the pruritus,
trial was undertaken(seebelow).
Since being neutered the dog had had a tendency to gain
weight.He also had hip dysplasia and had developed
osteoarthritis,the discomfort of which was particularly evident
in the winter months.He was medicated with meloxicam as
needed to control pain.

during the work-up.
This involves taking a careful history of the complete diet,including treatsand snacks.A diet containing a
novel protein to which the patient has not been previously exposed can then be selected.This can be
homemade or manufactured. Home-cooked diets usually require more effort on thepart of theowner and
compliance tends to be reducedwhen these are employed.An exampleof a suitable diet in many dogs is

breaking the diet once;for example,one snack containing a protein that the dog is allergic to can set back the

hydrate source may not be novel to the
animal but the diet ishydrolysed so that all
dietary antigens arereduced tomolecular

Owneradviceand homecare recommendations
Considerations for skin disease
The owner should be reminded that skin disease is often managed,not cured and,as a result,can be the
cause of significant frustration.Support for the owner is thereforeparamount andapatient,listening earis likely
tobe appreciated.
The importance of carrying out treatment as directed must be stressed to owners,particularly the
importance of sticking to the appropriate diet if food allergy is confirmed.Theowners should also ensure that
the dog has accessto a comfortable bed,aswell as to cool areas,to ease his itching.
Routine flea and tickprophylacticsare toberecommendedon all animalsin the household,asbitesfrom
