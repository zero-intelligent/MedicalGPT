ABSTRACT: Canine acute pancreatitis is challenging to diagnose and treat. Because this disease has
the potential for severe morbidity and mortality, accurate and timely diagnosis is important. The
ideal diagnostic test would be highly sensitive and specific, practical, affordable, and readily available.
Because no one diagnostic test fits these criteria, the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis must be made
based on evidence from a variety of diagnostic tests and clinical judgment.This article reviews some
of the tests available to diagnose pancreatitis.
