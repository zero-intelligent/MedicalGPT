Preface
The discipline of emergency and critical care is exciting, fast-paced, and often does not
allow itself the time for methodical thinking and analysis. The founding members of
the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care and the Veterinary
Emergency and Critical Care Society saw the need to constantly advance the knowledge
of pathophysiology, the use of technical equipment for diagnostics and patient monitor-
ing, and our skills as veterinarian clinicians and educators. Since that time, the role of
critically ill patient. The founding members' insight, motivation, and dedication to
emergency and critical care have allowed us to become the veterinarians and technicians
that we are in today's veterinary climate.
There are numerous textbooks that are dedicated to emergency and critical care and
internal medicine. In a busy emergency department (ED) or critical care unit (CCU).
quick thought and rapid timing are often essential parts of making a diagnosis, formu-
d e  p s n oe   n 
to our clients. For these reasons, specific topics from the original Five-Minute Veterinary
 a b e  o d n pa  so aq aa o
support tool for the busy ED or CCU, or for the general practitioner faced with an
emergency.
This textbook is divided into subjects by content and is organized in alphabetical
order. Each subject heading is also listed in alphabetical order in the Contents and by
subject in the Contents by Systems and in the index as well. The subject matter pre-
sented in Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consulr: Canine and Feline has been expanded
to include color photographs and flow diagrams with figure captions wherever possible.
Additionally, the details of each topic have been updated to include the latest state-of-
the-art information provided by leading experts in their fields.
I have been very privileged to work with more than sixty-five veterinarians, many of
whom are board certified in Emergency and Critical Care, Internal Medicine, Surgery.
Ophthalmology, Anesthesia, and Toxicology. My hope is that your copy of this textbook
quickly becomes wrinkled and cracked from frequent use. A book with a tattered cover
is well used and well loved. Read with enthusiasm, learn with greed, and take the best
care of our patients that you can.
Most sincerely.

Acknowledgments
This textbook could not have come to fruition without the hard work, expertise, and
contributions of the authors, who, by their dedication and knowledge, provided you
with the most current information on the topics related to emergency and critical care.
A very special thanks to the editors, Justin Jeffryes, Nancy Simmerman, and Erin
Gardner, who first approached me with the idea of this textbook. They, along with the
 staff at Wiley-Blackwell, supported me with patience and guidance throughout the long
journey from start to finish, for which I am very grateful.
Throughout the years, I have been privileged to work with numerous veterinary
residents, interns, and students whose thirst for knowledge and quest for "THE answer'
have not only kept me young. but also kept me on my toes!
Finally, my most heartfelt thanks and gratitude to the superb veterinarians and
veterinary nurses with whom I have worked over the years, including the Animal
Emergency Center in Glendale, Wisconsin; Colorado State University; and Wheat
Ridge Animal Hospital. Through their eyes, ears, and hands I have acquired immense
quantities of knowledge and have been taught the skills and compassion of emergency
and critical care.

Acetaminophen
Toxicity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a common over-the-counter pain medication.
Acetaminophen possesses antipyretic and analgesic properties similar to NsAIDs,
although it does not have any anti-inflammatory properties.
Acetaminophen is found in over two hundred over-the-counter and prescription
medications.
BOX 1.1
Tylenol
Children's Tylenol: 80 mg acetaminophen 
 Extra Strength Tylenol: 500mg acetaminophen
Opioid and acetaminophen combination products
Percocet: oxycodone and paracetamol (acetaminophen)
Midol and Pamprin@ contain acetaminophen.
Many "cold and sinus" products contain acetaminophen.
Sudafed? cold and sinus
Sudafed? sinus headache
Comtrex maximum  strength  sinus and nasal decongestant (with  chlorpheniramine and
pseudoephedrine)
Vicks Dayquil multi-symptom cold and flu (with dextromethorphan and pseudoephedrine)
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Metabolized by the liver via two pathways:
 The major pathway converts acetaminophen to inactive metabolites through con-
jugation to inactive glucuronide and sulfate metabolites.
 The minor pathway metabolizes acetaminophen by the p-450 mixed function
oxidase to a highly reactive toxic metabolite, NAPQl.
■ Under normal circumstances this minor route produces little NAPQ1, but in
the event of acetaminophen toxicity the glucuronidation pathway becomes
saturated and metabolism shifts to the production of NAPQl.
■ Under nontoxic conditions, glutathione is conjugated to NAPQl, which
effectively detoxifies it. In toxic conditions,glutathione stores quickly
become depleted, leaving NAPQI free to bind to lipid in the hepatocyte
membrane and causing hepatocellular necrosis.
■NAPQI also causes severe oxidative damage to red blood cells by causing the
oxidation of hemoglobin to metHb, a compound that does not carry oxygen.
Oxidation of hemoglobin also causes the formation of Heinz bodies.
 Cats lack glucuronyl transferase, which decreases the amount of metabolism through
the major pathway.
■ In cats, relatively smaller amounts of acetaminophen will produce more toxic metab-
■ Feline hemoglobin is also unique and contains eight sulfhydryl groups. Because of
this unique property, feline hemoglobin is more sensitive to oxidation and can form
metHb more rapidly with smaller amounts of acetaminophen.
■ In cats, methemoglobinemia may happen rapidly and become fatal before they show
signs of hepatotoxicosis.

blood cells and converts hemoglobin to metHb
 Figure 1.1 Facial edema may be seen in dogs, but it is more commonly seen in cats with acetaminophen
toxicity.
ACETAMINOPHEN TOXICITY
5
Genetics
 Toxicity is observed in cats more frequently seen than dogs due to their smaller body
size and decreased ability to glucoronidate and eliminate acetaminophen.
Incidence/Prevalence
■ Most common drug toxicity in cats
■ Less common in dogs
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Species
■ Most frequently cats, less commonly dogs
■No known breed predilections
History
■Administration of acetaminophen or history of ingestion of acetaminophen. Owners
 may not be aware that acetaminophen has potentially life-threatening effects in dogs
and cats.
 Owners may notice clinical signs within 1 to 4 hours after ingestion or signs may be
delayed until after metHb or hepatotoxicity occurs.
 Physical Examination Findings
■ Anorexia, salivation, vomiting, abdominal pain
■Hypothermia
■ Depression, weakness, coma in severe cases
■ Methemoglobinemia
■ Brown or cyanotic mucous membranes
■
Tachypnea
Respiratory difficulty/distress
Dark, chocolate-colored blood and urine
■
Edema of the face and paws (most commonly in cats, observed more rarely in dogs)
■Death
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Acetaminophen overdose
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Other drugs/toxicities causing methemoglobinemia:
■Nitrites
■
 Phenacetin
 Nitrobenzene
 Phenol and cresol compounds
Sulfites
 Naphthalene
 Resorcinol in cats
■Pyridium
■Local anesthetics
■Garlic or onions
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
Heinz bodies, especially in cats
 Possibly anemia due to lysis of affected red blood cells
Elevated ALT, Alk Phos
■ Liver values may increase 24 to 36 hours post-ingestion.
■Elevated total and direct bilirubin
■
Serum may be icteric
■ Large doses may be nephrotoxic; may see increases in BUN and creatinine
■May see orange or dark colored urine with hemoglobinuria or methemoglobinuria
Other Laboratory Tests
1Arterial blood gas
■ Methemoglobinemia is suspected with dark-colored blood that has a normal or
high PaO2.
■ May show a metabolic acidosis
■Schirmer tear test
■ Idiosyncratic reaction has been shown to cause KCS
 Sometimes seen at doses below the toxic dose
 Smaller dogs may be more susceptible
■Acetaminophen serum levels
 Can be measured at many human hospitals
■I
Highest level occurs l to 3 hours after ingestion
■Estimate metHb
■ Place a drop of blood on white filter paper; it looks brown if metHb is >15
percent.
ACETAMINOPHEN TOXICITY
■ Normal <l percent
■
 40 to 55 percent metHb causes neurologic depression
■ 70 percent metHb is acutely life-threatening
Toxic Dose
Dogs
■100 mg/kg is hepatotoxicity
 200 mg/kg and methemoglobinemia may be seen
Cats
No safe dose for cats; l0 mg/kg has produced toxic signs, although generally not seen
until 30 to 40 mg/kg. Cats generally show severe signs of methemoglobinemia rather
than hepatotoxicosis.

COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Clients should be aware that treatment in severe cases may be prolonged and
expensive.
■Affected animals may have residual liver damage.
Patient Monitoring
■Monitor liver enzymes every 12 to 24 hours initially.
Prevention/Avoidance
■Drugs that are metabolized by the liver may have prolonged half-lives.
■
Never give acetaminophen to cats.
■Be very cautious when giving acetaminophen to dogs.
Possible Complications
■ Liver necrosis and fibrosis
■Death
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Clinical signs may persist for 12 to 48 hours.
Rising liver enzymes 12 to 48 hours after ingestion raises serious concerns.
 Cats may die as a result of methemoglobinemia up to 36 hours after ingestion
■ Dogs may die of liver failure several days after ingestion.

Acute Renal Failure (ARF)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Defined as a sudden reduction in renal function that results in an accumulation of
uremic toxins and metabolic waste products.
These changes are represented by a sudden increase in BUN and creatinine, loss of
urine concentrating ability and acid-base and electrolyte derangements.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
ARF is classically defined by four phases:
■  Initiation, extension, maintenance, and recovery phases mark the progression
through all types of renal damage.
■  Initiation occurs during the initial insult, which leads to a progressive decline
 in renal function over hours to days. This causes renal tubular ischemia, tubular
cell sloughing and obstruction, and an associated drop in glomerular filtration
and ultrafltrate production.
■ Extension
■ Marks progression through cellular injury to death and overlaps with the main-
tenance phase.
1Maintenance
■  Establishes irreversible epithelial damage with a decreased GFR, urine output, and
renal blood flow.
■Recovery
■ The urine output increases and there is a progressive resolution in the azotemia.
Recovery depends on removal of tubular debris, replication of viable cells, and
recovery of GFR.
■ Azotemia does not result until >75 percent of the renal function is lost.
■ The kidney can adapt to a significant loss in tubular function before labwork
changes are detectable. Because the kidneys receive approximately 20 percent
of the cardiac output, and some substances are concentrated in the renal
tubules, nephrotoxins can cause severe damage at low doses. In both toxic
and hypoxic injury to the kidneys, the proximal tubule is the most severely
affected.

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (ARF)
15
CLINICAL FEATURES
 Clinical signs can be nonspecific but include most commonly anorexia, lethargy.
PU/PD, vomiting, hypotension, and abdominal pain.
 Azotemia with dilute urine (USG <l.020) is seen with or without oliguria (urine
output <0.5 to 1 ml/kg per hour) depending on the degree of renal dysfunction and
dehydration.
■ On physical examination dehydration is the most consistent finding: hypothermia
lingual or oral ulceration, painful enlarged kidneys, and melena are also commonly
seen.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Prerenal versus intrinsic renal versus postrenal causes are important to differentiate
for treatment and prognosis.
■ Prerenal causes have concentrated urine (USG > 1.030 in dogs and >1.035 in cats),
azotemia, dehydration and should resolve with rehydration.
■  Postrenal causes may have palpably enlarged, nonexpressible bladder in urethral
 obstruction, ureteral obstructions, or uroabdomen detectable through radiographs
and ultrasound. Distinguished through physical examination  and  initial
diagnostics.
 ARF or CRF: an acute worsening in pre-existing chronic renal disease. May see partial
resolution in azotemia with treatment and rehydration. Persistent azotemia with
isosthenuria, weight loss, anemia, and electrolyte alterations are commonly seen.
Inciting causes may include dehydration, gastrointestinal disease, pancreatitis, or
pyelonephritis so underlying cause for acute worsening should be investigated.
 Hypoadrenocortism: Causes a prerenal azotemia with isosthenuria due to inability
 to concentrate urine. Differentiated through electrolyte changes (i.e., hyponatremia,.
hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, absence of a stress leukogram) and ACTH stimulation
test.
Hepatorenal syndrome: Documented in humans but not proven to occur in animals
May potentially occur rarely in animals with advanced liver disease or failure.
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Chemistry
■ Urinalysis/USG
■  Urine culture and sensitivity
■Abdominal radiographs
■Abdominal ultrasound
Contrast nephropyelogram
■Excretory urogram
■Renal biopsy
■Ethylene glycol testing
■Serology for infectious diseases (e.g., leptospirosis, borreliosis [in dogs])
■FeLV/FIV (in cats)
Pathologic Findings
■ Variable degrees of nephrosis or nephritis, tubular epithelial necrosis, obstructive
tubular casts, focal tubular necrosis, interstitial edema and fibrosis, inflammatory cell
infiltration, or tubular regeneration.
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of choice
Fluid Therapy
  Intravenous fluids usually indicated unless hospitalization is not an option. Crystalloid
therapy aims to rehydrate, restore intravascular volume, induce diuresis and
restore electrolytes using a balance isotonic fluid (NaCl 0.9%, Norm-R, P-Lyte).
Intravenous fluids are continued until rehydration occurs and renal values normalize
or plateau.
Mannitol
■ Used as an osmotic diuretic to improve urine output; potential additional benefits
 are the flushing of renal tubules from cellular debris/casts and free radical scaveng-
ing. It is necessary to ensure that the patient is rehydrated prior to starting therapy
and mannitol should be avoided if anuric or hypervolemic because the associated
volume expansion will worsen volume overload.
Antibiotics
■ Indicated if urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, or infectious disease, such as
cline, are the drugs of choice for leptospirosis. Antibiotics for pyelonephritis should
be based on urine culture and sensitivity testing.
Furosemide
■ Leads to increased urine output in oliguric states. No human or veterinary studies
have shown this to improve survival, although they may be beneficial if hemodialysis
is not available to allow continued fluid therapy and treat volume overload.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (ARF)
17
 Figure 2.1 Hemodialysis can be used to filter uremic and other toxins from the blood in acute renal failure
Dopamine
■ A low continuous dose of dopamine has previously been documented to improve
renal blood flow. No studies have shown survival benefits to this so its use is
controversial.
Hemodialysis
■Provides clearance of uremic toxins and removes fluid associated with volume over-
load to allow the kidneys time to recover function (Figure 2.l). Many toxins are also
able to be removed through hemodialysis so early treatment can clear the toxin before
active metabolites form preventing renal damage from occurring. Referral to a vet-
erinary specialist that can perform dialysis is indicated if ARF is unresponsive to
Gastric Protectants
■Famotidine (0.5 to 1 mg/kg IM, IV, PO every 24 hours), ranitidine (2 mg/kg IV every
8 to 12 hours), omeprazole (0.7 to 2.0 mg/kg PO every 24 hours in dogs), sucralfate
(0.5 to 1 gPO every 6 to 8 hours)
Anti-Emetics
■ Ondansetron (0.6 mg/kg IV every 24 hours), dolasetron (0.6 mg/kg IV every 12 to
24 hours), metoclopramide (0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg per hour IV CRI or 0.2 to 0.5mg/kg
SQ, IV, PO every 6 to 8 hours), maripotant (1 mg/kg SQ every 24 hours)
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Precautions/Interactions
To avoid drug toxicities or inadvertent overdosage, care should be taken with reduced
doses and extended dosing interval if a medication is excreted through the kidneys.
Alternative Drugs
Diltiazem
 Reports in human medicine show improvement in GFR and urine production through
preglomerular dilation; has been documented for CRI use in dogs with leptospirosis
but veterinary reports are limited at this time.
Fenoldopam
■ Selective dopaminergic-1 receptor agonist used in humans for improved diuresis and
urine sodium excretion; shows promise for veterinary patients to improve renal
blood flow.
N-acetylcysteine
■Has potential protective benefits against contrast-induced nephropathy if given prior
to the contrast being given.
Diet
sn os i an s om jd a u sn i nns pu a 
there is intractable vomiting or nausea, enteral feeding is indicated.
■A moderately protein-restricted diet such as a commercial renal diet is preferred.
■ Feeding tube placement (e.g., nasogastric, esophageal, gastric) for nutritional support
if the patient is anorectic.
            
calorie source in cases of intractable vomiting.
■ Iransition to enteral feeding is preferred as soon as possible.
Surgical considerations
■ Ureterotomy for a complete ureteral obstruction may be indicated dependent on
residual kidney function and the extent of the obstruction.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ It is essential to inform the client about the potential for residual renal damage
 leading to CRF and associated complications.
■  Many cases require ongoing treatment, so careful evaluation of the case and discus-
sion on the prognosis are vital.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (ARF)
19
1Early discussions on referral and hemodialysis in severe cases or toxicities may result
in improved outcome and reduce irreversible renal damage so this should be offered
early if indicated.
Patient Monitoring
 Close monitoring with serial physical examinations is vital to continuously evaluate
hydration and volume status and to treat uremic complications as they arise.
Urine output monitoring with an indwelling urinary catheter is extremely useful to
quantify urine production, detect oliguria early, and match fluid administration with
 urine output to avoid hypervolemia.
Frequent weighing (every 6 to 8 hours) can also help to detect early fluid
retention.
 Regular monitoring every 8 to 12 hours of electrolytes, acid-base status, and renal
values should be used to guide fluid therapy and determine if therapy is being effec-
tive or if alternative therapies should be considered.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Attempts should be made to avoid any potentially nephrotoxic medications if evi-
dence of prior renal insufficiency or concurrent illness is noted.
■ Predisposing factors, such as prolonged anesthesia, hypotension, or hemodynamic
compromise, should be minimized where possible, particularly in patients with con-
current disease or other risk factors.
Possible Complications
■ Uremic gastritis
■Uremic pneumonitis
■Seizures
■Hypervolemia
■]
Pulmonary edema
■Gastrointestinal ulceration
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Survival from ARF in animals is dependent on the inciting cause in addition to how
prompt and aggressive treatment is.
 Overall mortality ranges from 40 to 60 percent with approximately 50 to 60 percent
leading to chronic renal failure.
■  In the majority of cases, infectious diseases, such as leptospirosis and nonoliguric
cases (of any cause), carry a better prognosis than toxicities or oliguric cases although
this is treatment dependent.
 Cases of anuric renal failure are usually fatal unless dialysis is available.

Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDs)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 ARDs is a severe inflammatory disorder of the lung that can cause respiratory failure
in dogs and cats.
  It is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema caused by lung inflammation, cel-
lular infiltration, and capillary leak.
■ ALI is a milder form of inflammatory injury to the lungs but can progress to ARDS.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
ALI and ARDS can occur from direct pulmonary insult, or, more commonly in criti-
cally ill patients, by a generalized inflammatory response such as SIRS or sepsis.
 In SIRS or sepsis, activation of tumor necrosis factor and pro-inflammatory interleu-
kins initiate inflammatory mediators and activation of neutrophils and macrophages
ARDS is a local pulmonary manifestation of SIRS.
 Pancreatitis can cause lung injury secondary to vascular endothelial damage by acti-
vated proteases and associated inflammation.
 Local pulmonary injury can trigger an inflammatory response that can become gen-
eralized within the lung parenchyma, with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
by inflammatory cells, lung epithelial cells, and fibroblasts.
Clinical and histopathologic findings are similar for all etiologies.
 Initial stages begin as a diffuse exudative vascular leak syndrome with infiltration of
neutrophils and macrophages and effusion of protein-rich fluid into the alveoli,
resulting in progressive pulmonary edema.
 Chemotaxis results in accumulation of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils.
contributing to ongoing lung injury.
 Continued inflammation and repair attempts result in proliferation of type I pneu-
mocytes, formation of hyaline membranes within alveoli (organization of protein-
rich fluid and cellular debris), deficiency of surfactant, and collapse and atelectasis
of alveoli.
1  This is followed by interstitial fibrosis as the lung attempts to repair the damaged
tissue, with inflammatory changes varying in severity and often unevenly distributed
in the lung.
21
22
1In more severely affected animals, the inflammation is severe and leads to severe
hypoxia and death of the patient.

may be most severely affected (Figures 3.l and 3.2).
 Small volume of pleural effusion may or may not be present.
Heart and blood vessel size should be normal, otherwise left-sided congestive heart
failure may be present rather than ARDS.

 Thrombocytopenia due to platelet sequestration or consumption
 Consumptive coagulopathy may be manifested by prolonged coagulation times and
elevated fibrin degradation products or D-dimers.
■ Chemistry panel usually has nonspecific changes, but hypoalbuminemia may occur
due to underlying disease and exudative protein loss into the pulmonary edema fluid
Additional Diagnostics
■ Elevation of CVP or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (>l8mm Hg) can also help
to suggest congestive heart failure or fluid overload, not ALI or ARDS.

■ Histology—diffuse alveolar damage, presence of hyaline membranes, congestion,
edema, neutrophil infiltration, hemorrhage, local thrombosis, and atelectasis. This is
followed by type II pneumocyte proliferation (replacing dead type I pneumocytes),

■If volume overload is present, judicious administration of diuretics such as
furosemide.
■ Colloid support if hypoproteinemic. Can include fresh frozen plasma (provides
coagulation factors and acute phase proteins in addition to albumin), synthetic col-
loids such as hetastarch, and 25 percent human albumin solutions.
■ Oxygen supplementation—animals with mild ALI may respond to oxygen supple-
mentation alone, but severe ARDS patients usually require PPV to achieve adequate
gas exchange.
■ PPV with PEEP recruits alveoli and increases functional residual capacity, allowing
ventilation at lower FiO and preventing cyclical alveolar reopening and stretching
with each breath. FiO, should be <0.6 to prevent oxygen toxicity and tidal volumes
should be as low as possible (ideally 6-8 ml/kg) to prevent overdistention of relatively
normal alveoli, shear stress, and progression of lung injury. Excessively high airway
pressures (>30 cmHzO) can cause worsening of lung permeability and also produce
pneumothorax.
Drug(s) of choice
 Many treatments have been evaluated experimentally in animal models and clinically
in humans with ARDs. These include corticosteroids, albumin solutions, furosemide,
N-acetylcysteine, pentoxifylline, surfactant, and a variety of cyclooxygenase, throm-
boxane, and leukotriene inhibitors. Although some appeared promising in canine
and feline models of ARDS, none have been shown to have an effect on morbidity
or mortality in human clinical trials.
■ Antibiotics if appropriate for underlying disease
■ Diuretics if volume overload or cardiac disease is suspected, but will not be beneficial
if pulmonary edema is due to ALI or ARDS alone. Careful if patient is hypovolemic;
may worsen cardiovascular status.
■ Supportive measures as required by patient: fluid therapy pressors if indicated, and
anesthesia to allow for PPV
■ Corticosteroids have been recommended in late, proliferative stage of ARDs (5-7
days), but has not been substantiated by scientific data

Amitraz Toxicity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Amitraz is applied topically to control ticks, mites, and lice.
 Products containing amitraz for dogs are formulated as a 19.9 percent emulsifiable
concentrate in l0.6-ml bottles for dilution and application as a topical pour on and
as a 9.0 percent impregnated twenty-five-inch 27.5-g collar.
■ The pesticide is found in Preventic flea and tick collars, ProMeris? topical spot-on
treatment (for dogs), and in external lotions and dip (Mitaban) used to treat demo-
dectic mange.
■ Flea and tick collars contain enough amitraz to cause clinical signs of intoxication
in a twenty-five-pound dog.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Amitraz affects peripheral Q- and Q-adrenergic receptor sites in the cardiovascular
system and Q-adrenergic receptor sites in the CNS, thus it is a Q-adrenergic agonist
 Toxic exposure can occur either through the oral or dermal route.
 After high dose, oral ingestion peak plasma concentration is reached at 6 hours and
elimination half-life is as long as 24 hours.
 The metabolites are excreted in the urine
Systems Affected
■ Nervous via peripheral-α-adrenergic agonistic action causing depression and ataxia
■ Cardiovascular  via  Q-adrenergic  agonistic action causing bradycardia and
hypotension
■ Gastrointestinal causing vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Toxicity in dogs is more commonly reported than in cats or other species
■Amitraz should never be used in cats.

BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Risk Factors/Causes
■  Increased predilection for toxicity in geriatric, sick, or toy breed animals
Historical Findings
■ Signs of sudden collapse, depression, vomiting, and diarrhea
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Neurological signs as depression, ataxia, and weakness
■
 Cardiovascular collapse with bradycardia, recumbency, and hypotension
■ Gastrointestinal signs of vomiting. diarrhea, and abdominal pain
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Recreational and prescription drugs such as marijuana, opioids, barbiturates, benzo-
diazepines, phenothiazines, antihypertensive drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, and
other depressive drugs
■ Ivermectin or milbemycin in very high doses to sensitive breeds
■ Alcohols such as ethanol, ethylene glycol (antifreeze), methanol (wind shield washer
fluid), isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol)
■
 Tick paralysis, botulism
■Head trauma
■Cardiovascular collapse
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry
■Hyperglycemia is common.
■ Liver enzymes may rarely be elevated.
Imaging
■ Abdominal radiology may reveal a collar buckle in the gastrointestinal tract.
Pathological Findings
■ High-dose and prolonged exposure shows increased liver weight; slight enlargement
of hepatocytes; thinning of the zonae fasciculata and reticularis; slight hyperplasia
of the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal glands
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
 Treatment of amitraz poisoning is best accomplished by gastric decontamination and
administration of antidotes (yohimbine or atipamezole).
Contraindications
■ Scrub with a hand dish-washing detergent; rinse with copious amounts of warm
water; institute nonspecific supportive therapy (e.g., intravenous fluids, maintenance
of normal body temperature, nutritional support); monitor 1 to 2 days until improve-
ment is noted.
Precautions/Interactions
■  Do not administer atropine, even if bradycardia occurs. Atropine may relieve some
clinical signs, however may cause other clinical signs to worsen, and may contribute
to hypertension.
■Do not induce emesis if the toxic substance was Mitaban@ dip, due to risk of aspira-
tion pneumonia.
Ingestion of Collar; Asymptomatic Patient
 Emetic as 3% USP hydrogen peroxide (2.2 m/kg PO maximum 45 ml after feeding a
moist meal); apomorphine, and especially xylazine, not recommended
■  Endoscopic retrieval of collar if large segments within the stomach; usually numer-
ous small pieces are located throughout the gastrointestinal tract, making endoscopic
removal difficult or unrealistic.
 Surgical removal of collar from gastrointestinal tract
■ Activated charcoal (2 g/kg PO) containing sorbitol
Marked Depression
 May require pharmacologic reversal of the Q-adrenergic effects
 Yohimbine (Yobine)0.1l mg/kg IV, administered slowly, reverses depression and
bradycardia within minutes; objective is to keep the patient in a state of low-level
depression with normal heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and blood
glucose concentrations
 Collar ingestions—monitor for recurrence of clinical signs; may need additional
yohimbine until collar segments appear in the stool
 Atipamezole (Antisedan)—0.05 mg/kg IM; reported to reverse poisoning within 10
minutes; repeated as needed; can be used an alternative when yohimbine is
unavailable
■Yohimbine and atipamezole may require initial repeated administration every 4 to 8
hours because half-life in dogs is short and elimination half-life of amitraz is longer

Anaphylaxis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Anaphylaxis is a severe multisystemic type I hypersensitivity reaction, which may
include hypotension or airway compromise. It is characterized by the release of
vasoactive substances from mast cells and basophils.
 Anaphylaxis is a term used when the reaction is mediated by IgE.
 Anaphylactoid is the term used for the same clinical syndrome without prior sensi-
tization and without IgE being a mediator. The terms will be used interchangeably
in this section.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 A multitude of agents can trigger anaphylaxis. By general type they include:
■Foods and additives
 Insect venoms
■ Virtually any drug, blood product, and biological substance
  The basic mechanism underlying type I allergic reactions is massive mast cell and
basophil degranulation and mediator release.
Systems Affected
Dogs
 Major shock organ is the liver with massive splanchnic congestion.
 All other systems affected as a result of the hypovolemia.
 Hemorrhage can also occur as a result of DIC.
■ A mild form of anaphylaxis can involve the skin and be manifested as urticaria
(Figure 5.1), pruritus, and angioneurotic edema (Figure 5.2).
■ The bowel can also be involved and be manifested as vomiting and defecation/
diarrhea.
Cats
 Major shock organs are the lungs and the intestines (Figures 5.3 and 5.4).
■Hypovolemia and hypoxemia can affect all other organ systems.

THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
Eliminate sensitizing agent if possible.
Discontinue use of the suspected drug.
■ For severe signs:
■ Epinephrine 0.0lmg/kg IM or IV; can repeat every 15 to 20 minutes, if
necessary.
38
 Epinephrine works immediately to cause large vessel vaso- and venoconstric-
tion, which will increase the systemic blood pressure. It is an essential and
life-saving drug for severe anaphylaxis
■ Give epinephrine IM unless there is complete cardiac dysfunction under which
circumstance it is given IV. Intravenous epinephrine can be arrhythmogenic.

■Ranitidine at 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg IV or famotidine at 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg IV every 12
hours.
Works as antihistamine and blocks H receptors.
■Antihistamines might be only drug of choice for mild anaphylaxis, but it will not
substitute for epinephrine for severe anaphylaxis.
■Glucocorticoids
■Actually requires several hours to take effect.
■Can give
■ Prednisolone sodium succinate 2 to l0 mg/kg initially
■]
Dexamethasone 1 mg/kg IM, IV initially
■ Glucocorticoids will antagonize the delayed mechanisms of the allergic reaction.
 Other therapeutic measures might be needed in the most severe form of anaphylaxis.
These include:
 Volume expanders such as intravenous saline, lactated Ringer's, or Normosol-R
■ Colloids such as hydroxyethyl starch—give colloids slowly to cats over a several-
hour period at a dose of 5 to 10 ml/kg.
 Dogs can receive up to 20 ml/kg over a 2- to 3-hour period under emergent condi-
tions, or 5 to 10 ml/kg as a fast bolus; otherwise it should be given at a slower rate
over a 24-hour period.
■Vasopressors
■ Dopamine 5 to 10μcg/kg per min IV
■Bronchodilators—for cats
■ Albuterol—can use inhaler with rebreathing device
 Terbutaline 0.0l mg/kg IM, IV
■Oxygen
■All animals with anaphylaxis must be hospitalized under intensive care
conditions.
Precautions/Interactions
■Epinephrine given IV can be arrhythmogenic.
■ Patient should have ECG and blood pressure monitoring.
ANAPHYLAXIS
39
Alternative Drugs
■ Remember that there is no substitute drug for epinephrine in severe anaphylaxis.
Diet
■Avoid any food that might be a sensitizing agent.
Activity
■No restrictions necessary.
Surgical Considerations
■ Anaphylaxis occurring during surgery can be fatal.
■  It should be considered when there is a sudden and unexplainable decline in blood
pressure.

Anterior Uveitis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Uveitis is a general term for inflammation in any portion of the uveal tract, regardless
of cause.
 Anterior uveitis is inflammation of the iris and ciliary body.
Posterior uveitis is inflammation of the choroid, usually with concurrent inflamma-
tion of the retina (chorioretinitis).
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■  Intraocular inflammation is initiated by local tissue injury (e.g., trauma, infectious
agent, immune mediated, neoplasia).
 Bilateral anterior uveitis often indicates an underlying systemic disease process.
Damaged tissue and microorganisms release tissue factors and inflammatory media-
tors that cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.
 The result is disruption of the blood-eye barrier, aqueous flare (increased protein in
the anterior chamber), and migration of inflammatory cells into the anterior chamber
and anterior uveal tissue.
 Causes of uveitis can be exogenous (blunt or penetrating trauma; corneal ulceration
or infection) or endogenous (systemic or primary intraocular disease).
Dogs
sii); bacterial (brucellosis,borreliosis, any bacterial septicemia); protozoal ( Toxoplasma
gondii, Leishmania); viral (infectious canine hepatitis); aberrant parasite migration
(fly larvae, nematode larvae)
 German shepherd dogs are predisposed to disseminated saprophytic fungal infec-
tion (Aspergillus sp., Candida sp., Penicillium sp., Paecilomyces sp.).
Immune-mediated/presumed immune-mediated causes—exposure to lens proteins
(cataract or lens rupture); uveodermatologic syndrome; idiopathic; uveitis associated
with uveal cysts; CAV-1 and CAV-2 vaccine reaction; scleritis
 Neoplastic causes—primary intraocular or metastatic to eye

■  Metabolic causes—hyperlipidemia
■Miscellaneous causes—systemic hypertension; hyperviscosity syndrome; lens
luxation
Cats
■ Systemic infectious causesviral (FeLV, FIV, FIP possibly FHV-l): protozoan
( Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania); bacterial (Bartonella sp., any cause of septicemia),
fungal (blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, cryptococcosis).
■ Immune-mediated/presumed immune-mediated causes—exposure to lens proteins
(cataract or lens rupture); idiopathic.
■ Neoplastic causes—-primary intraocular or metastatic to eye.
Systems Affected
■ Ophthalmic
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Anterior uveitis can occur in any dog or cat regardless of age, breed, or sex.
■Because there are many causes for anterior uveitis, the signalment and history of the
patient will vary and should be used as a tool to guide the clinician toward a diag-
nostic plan.
Historical Findings
■ Red (scleral injection) or cloudy (corneal edema, aqueous flare) eye of variable
duration
Ocular pain (squinting, tearing. rubbing eye)
■Decreased vision
 Previous trauma may indicate traumatic uveitis.
Weight loss, lethargy or deceased appetite may indicate a systemic cause.
 Bilateral uveitis supports systemic disease as the cause.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Injection of conjunctival and scleral vessels.
Aqueous flare—may be subtle and difficult to detect or severe causing anterior
chamber to appear cloudy.
Corneal edema—may be subtle or severe.
■  Inflammatory cells may or may not be detected as hypopyon (white cells settled out
in anterior chamber) or keratic precipitates (white cells deposited on the corneal
endothelium, Figure 6.l).
ANTERIOR UVEITIS

 Figure 6.1 Dog with chronic anterior uveitis, as indicated by the extensive corneal neovascularization. The
corneal endothelium has numerous keratic precipitates causing the intraocular structures to be partially obscured.

fibrin clot is in the central pupil and pigment from the posterior iris pigmented epithelium has been deposited
 onto the lens capsule.
Fibrin or blood clots in anterior chamber

 Miosis is seen primarily when acute, pupil is often mid-range.
■ Iris swelling and vessel dilation—most obvious in light-colored eyes (Figure 6.2).
 Posterior synechia (adhesion of iris to lens capsule)—causes abnormal pupil shape
is seen in chronic cases and may be minimal or extensive (Figure 6.3).

iris is thickened and the iris vessels are injected. The circle in the dorsal pupil is a reflection
■ Iris bombe—accumulation of aqueous humor behind the iris causing it to billow
forward, due to extensive posterior synechia preventing aqueous humor from enter-
ing the anterior chamber through the pupil.
■ Decreases IOP unless aqueous humor outflow is obstructed, IOP can then be in
normal range or elevated.
■ If systemic disease is the cause of uveitis, related clinical signs may be detected.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■Conjunctivitis—injection of conjunctival vessels only, ocular discharge, no intraocu-
lar changes associated with anterior uveitis, normal IOP, pain usually mild and
relieved with topical anesthetic
■ Episcleritis/scleritis—conjunctival and scleral vessel injection, perilimbal corneal
edema, sclera may be thickened, IOP and intraocular examination normal unless
causing anterior uveitis
■ Glaucoma—elevated IOP, dilated pupil common, globe may be enlarged (buphthal-
mos), and cornea may have stria
ANTERIOR UVEITIS
45
 Any condition that causes injection of the conjunctival or scleral vessels (e.g., kera-
titis, Horner's syndrome)
DIAGNOSTICS
Ocular examination including corneal fluorescein staining and IOP measurement.
 Systemic disease—general physical examination, CBC, serum chemistries, urinalysis.
Further testing (serology, microbiology, imaging studies) is done based on the results
of physical examination and initial lab work
■  Ocular ultrasound is indicated when primary ocular disease is suspected or identified
and intraocular examination is not possible due to opacification.
 Examination of aqueous or vitreous humor may be required for diagnosis; ocular
fluids can be used for cytology, culture and sensitivity, polymerase chain reaction,
and antibody content.
Pathologic Findings
 Cornea—edema; neovascularization (if chronic); keratic precipitates (aggregates of
WBCs on corneal endothelium)
Anterior chamber—RBCs, WBCs, and fibrin

 Iris-WBC infiltration (cell type dependent on etiology); adhesions of iris to lens
(posterior synechia); adhesions of iris to cornea (anterior synechia); preiridal fibro-
vascular membrane (if chronic)

ANTERIOR UVEITIS
47
 Methylprednisolone acetate may result in a subconjunctival inflammatory plaque
that causes discomfort.
 Topical atropine can significantly reduce tear production.
■Continuous dilation of the pupil with atropine may obstruct aqueous humor outflow
and contribute to development of secondary glaucoma.
Use of systemic NSAIDs in cats has been associated with potentially serious side
effects.
■ Avoid treating with drugs that constrict the pupil (pilocarpine, latanoprost, deme-
carium bromide).
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ The use of topical steroids is contraindicated if a corneal ulcer develops. Prevent
self-trauma with a protective collar if necessary.
  Frequent follow up examinations are essential if inflammation is moderate to severe
because secondary glaucoma is common.
■Further client education based on identified underlying cause.
Patient Monitoring
Recheck in 1 to 7 days depending on severity.
■ Monitor IOP-IOP because it will increase with decreased inflammation; if IOP
increases with static or worsening inflammation this indicates aqueous outflow
obstruction and impending glaucoma.
■ Frequency of subsequent rechecks is dependent upon response to therapy.
Prevention/Avoidance
■  Inadequate control of inflammation due to undertreating or discontinuing NSAIDs
too soon or too rapidly may lead to recurrent or chronic uveitis.
■ Whenever possible, the cause of uveitis should be identified and eliminated to
 prevent recurrence.
Possible Complications
Posterior synechia causing abnormal pupil shape (dyscoria)
 Secondary glaucoma is common.
Secondary cataract formation
■ Retinal detachment
Lens luxation

Anticoagulant Rodenticide
Toxicity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Ingestion of anticoagulant rodenticide compounds results in a depletion of vitamin
K and functional vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors and causes an acquired
coagulopathy.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, is a crucial cofactor for hepatic posttranslational
carboxylation of coagulation factors I1, Vl1, IX, and X (and protein C and protein S)
(Figure 7.1).
 Anticoagulant rodenticide ingestion inhibits the hepatic enzyme, vitamin K epoxide
reductase, and prevents the recycling of the vitamin K metabolite, vitamin K epoxide,
back to its functional form (Figure 7.2).
Once hepatic vitamin K stores are depleted, production of functional vitamin
K-dependent coagulation proteins ceases and causes the formation of PIVKAs.
 PIVKAs are incapable of chelating calcium and therefore are unable to successfully
partake in secondary hemostasis (soluble factor coagulation cascade).
Systems Affected

Gastrointestinal—sublingual or gastric hemorrhage, hemoabdomen

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ No specific signalment, although intact animals may be more likely to roam and be
accidentally or maliciously exposed to toxins.
Risk Factors/Causes
 The presence of vitamin K antagonist rodenticides in the immediate environment.
Historical Findings
■  May reveal possible exposure to or ingestion of anticoagulant rodenticides
Ingestion of an animal that consumed anticoagulant rodenticide (relay toxicosis)
Vomit or feces with green- or turquoise-colored granules in it
 Respiratory difficulty or hemorrhage
Tolerance of previous surgery or trauma without evidence of clinical bleeding
CLINICAL FEATURES
Clinical features are similar for dogs and cats

most frequently develop between 2and 6 days following
consumption.
■ In the acutely bleeding patient, hypoproteinemia will generally develop prior to the
anemia; anemia may develop simultaneously or before hypoproteinemia in the face
of slow and sustained hemorrhage.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Similar between dogs and cats, with the exception of variations in inherited coagula-
tion factor deficiencies
■Hepatic failure
 Disseminated intravascular coagulation
 Dilutional coagulopathy
 Congenital factor deficiency
 Massive heparin overdose
■ Spurious results (underfilling tube, polycythemia, delay in performing assay)
■ Absolute vitamin K deficiency (malnourished patients receiving broad-spectrum
antibiotic therapy posthepatic biliary obstruction, or exocrine pancreatic insuff-
ciency or intestinal malabsorption)
 Abnormal gamma-glutamyl carboxylase enzyme (Devon Rex)
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Diagnosis is often made with a history clinical presentation, or coagulation profile
that supports the diagnosis, all in the face of a rapid response to vitamin K, therapy.
 Following ingestion, an anticoagulant effect is initially manifested as a prolonged
 (( )  p e    ( t) sn 
initial anticoagulant effect is due solely to factor Vll deficiency which has the short-
est half-life (generally 6 hours).
■ Prolongation of the aPTT follows, after an additional 24 to 48 hours (48-96 hours
post-ingestion).
■ Prolongation of the ACT is the last coagulation test to be abnormal, due to its lack
of sensitivity to coagulation factor deficiency.
■ A patient with spontaneous, active hemorrhage will have prolongation of PT, aPTT,
ACI, and PIVKA test.
■ Rarely is analysis of plasma or hepatic tissue needed to confirm the presence of
compatible toxin.
Pathological Findings
 Presence of nonclotting blood found on aspiration of body cavity or swelling.
Hemorrhage in the airways; uncommonly hemorrhage from mucosal surfaces.
52
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
THERAPEUTICS
■ Treatment depends on timing of ingestion and the urgency of the clinical
 presentation.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Emesis is induced if ingestion occurred within previous 2 hours.
■ Activated charcoal administration is ideal if ingestion occurred within previous 2
hours; this however may delay efficacy of orally administered vitamin K.
■ Vitamin K;: 2.5 to 5mg/kg per day PO for up to 6 weeks (dependent on agent
ingested) is indicated for all patients with confirmed or even suspected ingestion;
oral administration is generally more rapidly effective (<12 hours) than SQ (12-24
hours) and safer than intravenous dosing (risk of anaphylaxis).
■ Vitamin K, therapy alone is usually sufficient to reverse the anticoagulant effect in
  In more urgent cases (i.e., presence of hemorrhage) plasma (fresh frozen or frozen)
10 to 15ml/kg or whole blood (fresh or stored) up to 20ml/kg are administered.
concurrently with oral or SQ vitamin K to promptly (although temporarily) reverse
anticoagulation.
■Cautious intravenous fluid administration to reverse shock, while minimizing exac-
erbation of further hemorrhage with unnecessary or excessive increases in blood
pressure.
■ Oxygen therapy if hypoxemia is present or in an attempt to ease respiratory distress;
avoid nasal oxygen cannulation due to risk of inducing hemorrhage/epistaxis.
Precautions/Interactions
 Orally administered vitamin K may be insufficiently absorbed if concomitant intes-
tinal malabsorption or extrahepatic biliary obstruction is present; hepatic dysfunc-
tion tempers the response to vitamin K therapy.
 Allergic reactions (i.e., urticaria, angioneurotic edema) may occur with SQ vitamin
K, therapy whereas anaphylaxis is a concern with intravenous administration.
■ Vitamin K, administered IM may result in hematoma formation and therefore is
contraindicated.
■ Small-gauge needles should be used for SQ administration of vitamin K (or any
other parenteral medications) in several different sites to expedite absorption.
 Gastroenteric lavage is not indicated due to rapidly reversible nature of toxicity.
Alternative Drugs
■ Oxyglobin may be utilized to temporarily improve oxygen-carrying capacity if blood
products are not readily available, providing time for vitamin Kl therapy to become
effective.
ANTIC OAGULANT RODENTICIDE TOXICITY
53
Diet
■ Administration of vitamin K with a high fat meal (i.e., canned food) improves
bioavailability.
Activity
■ With complicated toxicity, activity should be limited to avoid exacerbation of
hemorrhage.
Surgical Considerations
■ Thoracocentesis may be indicated if the development of a hemothorax sufficiently
compromises respiration.
■ Preferably avoid unnecessary procedures until coagulation ability has normalized.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Early in the course of therapy provide extra bedding to prevent pressure-induced
hemorrhage and avoid restraint with a collar to limit risk of ocular or intracranial
hemorrhage.
■ Herbal supplements, notably garlic, gingko, and ginseng. may exacerbate hemor-
rhagic tendencies.
Toxins may be excreted in the milk of lactating patients.
Patient Monitoring
■ For uncomplicated and complicated toxicity, monitor PT 48 to 96 hours after dis-
continuation of vitamin K, therapy to prove therapy has been administered for a
sufficient duration; if prolonged, reinstitute vitamin K, therapy for 1 to 3 more weeks
and repeat PT as previously instructed.
For complicated toxicity, monitor for clinical signs associated with hemorrhage (i.e.
tachycardia, pale mucous membranes, increase in respiratory rate, evidence of pleural
space disease, hypotension, collapse, etc.).
Prevention/Avoidance
■Do not allow further access to toxin.
■ Preferably avoid elective, invasive procedures until coagulation deficits have
normalized.
■ Nursing puppies or kittens should be changed to hand rearing and possibly supple-
mented with vitamin K, therapy.

BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Possible Complications
■Fatal hemorrhage (i.e., intracranial, myocardial, pericardial, intrapulmonary)
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ In the absence of fatal hemorrhage, early and aggressive therapy should provide
complete recovery with rapid cessation of hemorrhage and eventually normalization
of coagulation tests (PT, aPTT, and ACT)

Arterial Thromboembolism
(ATE)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
ATE results from a thrombus or blood clot that is dislodged within the aorta, causing
severe ischemia to the tissues served by that segment of aorta. It is one of the most
devastating complications associated with myocardial diseases in cats.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1ATE is most commonly associated with myocardial disease in cats, including hyper-
trophic, restrictive, and dilated cardiomyopathy.
 Although the exact etiology of ATE has not been determined, it is theorized that
abnormal blood flow (stasis) and a hypercoagulable state contribute to the formation
of the thrombus within the left atrium. The blood clot is then embolized distally to
the aorta.
 The most common site of embolization is the caudal aortic trifurcation causing isch-
emic injury to both hind legs (Figure 8.1).
■ Other less common sites include the front leg (Figure 8.2), kidneys, gastrointestinal
tract, or cerebrum.
■ Although ATE is a well-recognized complication of myocardial disease in cats, the
exact prevalence of ATE is not known in the general population of cats. In one study
of cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, approximately 17 percent presented with
signs of ATE.
■ Although >95 percent of ATE in cats are associated with advanced feline heart
disease, another associated condition is neoplasia, typically pulmonary carcinoma.
 ATE rarely occurs in dogs. ATE in dogs typically is associated with neoplasia, sepsis,
Cushing's disease, protein-losing nephropathy, or other hypercoagulable states.
Severe heart disease is not often associated with ATE in the dog.
Systems Affected
Cardiovascular—the majority of affected cats have advanced heart disease and expe-
rience left-sided heart failure.
1 Nervous/musculoskeletal—severe ischemia to the muscles and nerves served by the
segment of occluded aorta causes variable pain and paresis. Gait abnormalities or
paralysis results in the leg or legs involved.

deficits.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
       
■Median age is typically 7 to 10 years (Range 1-20 years).
Males are more commonly affected than females (2:l).
■ The most common breed affected is the mixed breed cat. However, certain breeds
have been overrepresented, such as Ragdolls, typically mirroring breeds that are
prone to cardiomyopathies.
ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM (ATE)
57
Risk Factors/Causes
 Although clear risk factors have not been defined, it is theorized that an enlarged
left atrium or spontaneous echo contrast of the red blood cells or "smoke” observed
on an echocardiographic examination may be risk factors.
Historical Findings
 Acute onset paralysis/paresis and pain are the most common owner complaints.
 Lameness or other gait abnormality may be seen.
■
 Tachypnea or respiratory distress is common.
Vocalization and anxiety are common.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Usually paraparesis or paralysis of the rear legs. Typically both rear legs are affected
equally but occasionally one leg is worse than the other. Less commonly, monopa-
resis of a front leg.
 Pain upon palpation of the affected legs. Gastrocnemius muscle often becomes firm
several hours after embolization.
Absent or diminished femoral pulses
■
Cyanotic or pale nail beds and footpads (Figure 8.3)
 Affected limbs will be cooler than unaffected limbs upon palpation.
■Figure 8.3 Differential cyanosis. Note the cyanotic discoloration of the footpads in the limb affected by
the clot.
85
BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Cardiac murmur or gallop sound may or may not be present. Despite the typical
presence of severe heart disease in cats, often times a murmur or gallop may not be
heard.
■ Tachypnea or respiratory distress, sometimes with open mouth breathing, is often
present either due to pain associated with the ischemic leg injury or due to concur-
rent congestive heart failure.
■Cardiac dysrhythmias may also be present. Dysrhythmias are more common during
     s   n 
■Hypothermia is common in cats with ATE and is often associated with poor systemic
perfusion and worse prognosis.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Hind limb paresis secondary to other causes such as spinal neoplasia, trauma, myeli-
tis, fibrocartilaginous infarction, or intervertebral disk protrusion.
DIAGNOSTICS
Typically, the diagnosis of ATE is made by physical exam alone. Many cats are in
distress and empiric treatment is often initiated prior to diagnostic testing. In the cat.
further diagnostic evaluation is helpful to better evaluate the severity and nature of
the associated cardiac disease as well as systemic effects of the ATE. This information
may be helpful for prognosis and treatment.
■ In the dog, diagnostic evaluation is helpful to better understand the associated
disease causing the hypercoagulable state.
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry Panel/Urinalysis
Common abnormalities include:
■ Elevated CPK, AST, ALT
Stress hyperglycemia
■
Azotemia with elevated BUN and creatinine as a result of possible low effective cir-
culating volume or renal emboli
■ Electrolyte abnormalities are common (i.e., hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypocal-
and reperfusion injury.
■  CBC and urinalysis changes are nonspecific.
■In the dog, a protein-to-creatinine ratio is advised if proteinuria is identified.
Other Laboratory Tests
■  Routine coagulation profile typically does not reveal significant abnormalities.
■ In the dog, D-dimers are typically markedly elevated.
ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM (ATE)
59
1 Baseline coagulation profile may be helpful to titrate heparin and possibly warfarin
dosages.
■ Thyroid hormone should be measured in cats over 7 years of age
Thoracic Radiography
1 Cardiomegaly is common and radiographic signs of congestive heart failure (i.e.,
pulmonary edema and/or pleural effusion) is seen in approximately 50-66 percent
of cats.
■ The presence of a pulmonary mass in the absence of heart disease in a cat with ATE
is concerning for pulmonary carcinoma associated embolus.
Echocardiography
■ The majority of cats will have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy characterized by left
ventricular hypertrophy, nondilated left ventricular lumen, and enlarged left atrium.
 Other types of heart disease are also possible such as unclassified, restrictive, or
dilated cardiomyopathy and thyrotoxic heart disease.
 Regardless of the type of myocardial disease present, the majority (>50%) have severe
left atrial enlargement, (i.e., a left atrial to aortic ratio of ≥2.0).
■ Occasionally, a left atrial thrombus or spontaneous echo contrast of the red blood
cells (smoke) may be seen (Figure 8.4).

Abdominal Ultrasonography
■ An experienced sonographer may be able to identify the thrombus in the caudal
aorta. However, this imaging modality typically is not necessary to reach a diagnosis.
especially in a cat.
■ Abdominal ultrasound may be more useful in the dog to both identify the thrombus
and look for associated diseases.
Computed Tomography Scan
■ As with abdominal sonography, a multidetector CT scan is not necessary for diag-
nosis in a cat but could be helpful in a dog to reach a diagnosis, evaluate the extend
of the thrombus and look for associated diseases.
Pathologic Findings
■ Thrombus typically is identified at the caudal aortic trifurcation.
■ Occasionally, a left atrial thrombus is seen.
■ Emboli of the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, cerebrum, and other organs also may
be observed.
THERAPEUTICS
The main objectives of treatment are threefold:
■First, immediate treatment of the pain associated with ischemic injury of the legs.
typically with injectable opioids.
■ Treatment directed at resolving the actual thrombus with anticoagulants or possibly
thrombolytic agents.
■ Treatment of the cat's heart disease and possible congestive heart failure
Drug(s) of Choice
Pain Management
Once the diagnosis is reached, addressing the pain and distress associated with ATE is
an immediate concern. If possible, intravenous opioid administration is preferred
because of its rapid onset of action, bioavailability, and safety profile.
■ In the cat, buprenorphine at 0.005 to 0.0l mg/kg IV every 6 to 8 hours as needed is
an initial good choice. Buprenorphine can also be given in the cheek pouch or SQ
if intravenous access is not obtained.
■ Fentanyl (2-3μg/kg intravenous bolus, then 1-5μg /kg per hour IV CRI).
Hydromorphone (0.025-0.1 mg/kg IV or SQ every 4-6 hours)
Butorphanol (0.05-0.3 mg/kg IV or SQ every 2-6 hours as needed) has fewer anal-
e a sio r ou  'as po e si iq aq i sia is
able or if the cat's pain is assessed as mild, then butorphanol is a reasonable choice.
■Cautious use of low dose acepromazine (0.0l mg/kg IV or SQ every 8-12 hours as
need) may be helpful for additional sedation and vasodilation. Avoid acepromazine
in patients with hypotension or hypothermia because of concerns of worsening sys-
temic perfusion.
Antithrombotic Management
vator is used extensively in human and infrequently in cats. These drugs are expen-
sive, carry a significant risk for bleeding complications, need to be administered
within a few hours of ATE, and have not demonstrated significant therapeutic benefit
over conservative management in veterinary medicine. Thus, they are rarely used in
general practice settings.
1 Unfractionated heparin is the preferred drug in most clinical practices. Heparin actu-
ally has no effect on the established clot; however, it prevents further activation of the
coagulation cascade and allows the body's endogenous fibrinolytic system to break
down the clot. The initial dose typically is given IV then followed with subcutaneous
administrations every 6 to 8 hours. The initial intravenous dose is 100 to 200 units/kg
and the subsequent subcutaneous dose is 200 to 300 units/kg. Alternatively, an intra-
venous CRl of heparin at 600 units/kg per day could be used after the initial bolus. The
dose is then ideally titrated to prolong the aPTT approximately twofold.
 In addition to heparin, the concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent is also advised
  (     n)   so  o 
(18.75 mg (1/4 of a 75-mg tablet) PO ever 24 hours).
■ The higher dose of aspirin may be associated with more gastrointestinal adverse
effects.
■ The theoretical benefit of clopidogrel is less gastrointestinal adverse effects and
 possible enhanced efficacy.

over 1 to 2 days and long-term therapy is continued.
Dog
■Acute antithrombotic management considerations are similar in the dog.
 The dose of heparin in the dog is generally the same as in the cat. The doses of the
antiplatelet agents are different.
■Canine aspirin dose is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg PO every 24 hours.
■ The dose of clopidogrel dose in the dog is approximately 2 mg/kg PO every 24
hours.
■ A higher loading dose of 10 to 1l mg/kg could be used on the first day if active
clot is associated with significant ischemia.
Long-Term Therapy
 Recommendations for long-term anticoagulation are variable because no one treat-
ment modality has shown clear benefit over another.
62 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Factors involved in deciding which long-term therapy to use include expense, ease
of oral as opposed to subcutaenous administration, need for reevaluation, and
monitoring.
■ Commonly used long-term anticoagulant therapies include aspirin, clopidogrel, or a
 low molecular weight heparin. None of these treatment options require monitoring
for therapeutic efficacy.

days but carries a higher risk of gastrointestinal and renal adverse effects
Clopidogrel (18.75 mg every 24 hours) is moderately expensive and is dosed daily
but may have enhanced long-term efficacy.
 Low molecular weight heparins have also been used in the long-term management
of cats surviving an ATE.
 Dalteparin (100-200 unit/kg SQ every 12-24 hours) or enoxaparin (1.5 mg/kg SQ
every 12-24 hours) are two commonly used low molecular weight heparins
The disadvantages of these medications are expense, subcutaneous administration,
and controversy over the therapeutically efficacious dose in the cat.
Congestive Heart Failure Management
■ Oxygen-rich environment
■ Furosemide (1-4 mg/kg as needed, not to exceed 12 mg/kg per day) IV or SQ should
provide immediate relief of respiratory distress due to concurrent congestive heart
failure.
■ Other cardiac therapies such as enalapril, diltiazem, or pimobendan may also be
indicated.
Precautions/Tnteractions
■ Anticoagulant therapy with heparin, clopidogrel, or the thrombolytic drugs may
cause severe bleeding complications.
■ Reperfusion of severely ischemic legs may be associated with severe hyperkalemia
Death due to hyperkalemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury is a common cause of
in-hospital mortality.
■ Avoid a nonselective β-blocker such as propranolol as it may enhance peripheral
vasoconstriction.
Alternative Drugs
■ Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is the anticoagulant most widely used in humans
and could be considered if recurrent ATE.
■ The initial dose is 0.05 to lmg/kg PO every 24 hours. It should be overlapped
with heparin therapy for 3 days. The dose is then adjusted to prolong the PT
approximately two times its baseline value or to attain an INR of 2.0-4.0.
Warfarin has an unpredictable dose-to-response effect and is highly protein bound.
Thus, frequent monitoring and titration of the dose are required. Warfarin also
carries a more significant risk of bleeding.
ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM (ATE)

Diet
■ Initially, most cats are anorexic. Tempt these cats with any type of diet. It is important
  s  so  e  a s   
used. Naso-eophageal tube feedings may be indicated if more than 3 days of
anorexia. Chronic dietary management usually involves sodium restriction.
Activity
■ Activity should be restricted. The cat should be kept quiet, stress free and indoors
only.
Surgical Considerations
 Surgical embolectomy typically is not recommended because these patients are high
risks for surgery and anesthesia as a result of their heart disease.
1 Rheolytic thrombectomy has recently been evaluated in the treatment of feline ATE
with favorable treatment results but is not commonly available even at tertiary refer-
ral centers.
COMMENTS
■ It should be emphasized that the finding of tachypnea, even open mouth breathing.
upon initial examination should not presume congestive heart failure. Some cats may
be tachypneic solely as a result of pain. If the tachypnea persists after appropriate
analgesic therapy, or if physical examination (crackles) or radiographic findings are
compatible with pulmonary edema, then furosemide therapy is indicated.
 Fluid therapy may be necessary in the initial stages if the cat is not in congestive
heart failure.
  Initially, the affected legs should be minimally handled because reperfusion results:

full recovery.
■  No venipuncture should be performed on the affected legs.
 Initially, these cats may have difficulty posturing to urinate and may need to have
their bladders expressed periodically to prevent overdistention of the bladder or
urine scald.
Client Education
■ Owners should be aware of the poor short- and long-term prognosis. Many cats will
have advanced heart disease and are at risk for re-embolization. They will require
lifelong medications, re-evaluations, and an indoor lifestyle if the cat survives to
discharge.
 Typically, most cats that survive an initial episode will recover complete function to
the legs: however, some neurologic or musculoskeletal deficits may persist.
64
Patient Monitoring
 Hourly to daily examination of the legs, femoral pulses, and respiratory rate should
 be performed to assess clinical response to therapy.
 Continuous ECG monitoring is helpful to identify hyperkalemia cardiac arrhythmias/
conduction disturbances associated with severe reperfusion injury.
■ aPTT can also be monitored once daily to titrate the heparin dose
■ Periodic evaluation of thoracic radiographs, electrolyte, and renal parameters are also
helpful in evaluating response to therapy.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Because of the high rate of re-embolization (25 to 75 %) after surviving an initial
episode, prevention with either chronic aspirin, clopidogrel or low molecular weight
heparin is strongly recommended. See above for doses.
Possible Complications
■ Death is unfortunately a common outcome either due to progression of disease or
complication of therapy.
■Bleeding complications may arise with the anticoagulant therapy.
■ Life-threatening hyperkalemia and arrhythmias due to reperfusion injury is a com-
plication of therapy.
■  Permanent neurological deficits or muscular abnormalities in the hind limbs may
arise in some cats (←-15 percent) with severe and prolonged ischemia.
■Ifa cat survives initial episode of ATE, recurrence of ATE and congestive heart failure
is common.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Both short-term and long-term prognosis are generally poor. Most cats (>50
 percent) are euthanized or die during their initial ATE event regardless of therapy
utilized.
■ Admitting rectal temperature of >99° F fast heart rate, only one limb affected and
 presence of motor function are all associated with better short-term prognosis.
■ Concurrent congestive heart failure is associated with a worse long-term prognosis.
In one study, cats with concurrent congestive heart failure had a median survival
S  n    a e a s i n s
■Refractory congestive heart failure or recurrence of ATE is typical terminal issues if
a cat survives an initial ATE event.
■ Expected course of recovery is generally days but can be weeks for return of function
to the legs.

Atrial Fibrillation and
Atrial Flutter
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Atrial fibrillation—rapid, irregularly irregular supraventricular rhythm.
 Two forms recognized: primary atrial fibrillation, an uncommon disease that occurs
mostly in large dogs with no underlying cardiac disease, and secondary atrial fibril-
lation, which occurs in dogs and cats secondary to underlying cardiac disease.
 Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the atrial rate is generally slower and
is characterized by saw-toothed flutter waves in the baseline of the ECG. The ven-
tricular response is generally rapid but may be regular or irregular.
Electocardiogram Features
Atrial Flutter
 Atrial rhythm usually regular; rate approximately 300 to 400 beats per minute
P waves usually discerned as either discrete P waves or a “saw-toothed" baseline
              
duction, but are generally regular or regularly irregular and rapid.
Conduction pattern to the ventricles is variable—in some cases every other atrial
depolarization produces a ventricular depolarization (2:1 conduction ratio), giving
a regular ventricular rhythm; other times the conduction pattern appears random,
giving an irregular ventricular rhythm that can mimic atrial fibrillation (Figure 9.1).
Secondary Atrial Fibrillation
■ No P waves present—baseline may be flat or may have small irregular undulations
("f" waves); some undulations may look like P waves (Figure 9.2).
■ Ventricular rate high—usually 180 to 240 beats per minute in dogs and >220 beats
per minute in cats.
■ Interval between QRS complexes is irregularly irregular; QRS complexes usually
appear normal.
Primary Atrial Fibrillation
Similar to secondary atrial fibrillation except ventricular rate usually in the normal
range.

Risk Factors/Causes
■ Heart disease
 Chronic valvular disease
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND ATRIAL FLUTTER
69
Cardiomyopathy
 Congenital heart disease
■ Digoxin toxicity
■Idiopathic
■ Ventricular pre-excitation (atrial flutter)
Atrial Fibrillation
 Caused by numerous small reentrant pathways creating a rapid (>5o0 depolarizations
per minute) and disorganized depolarization pattern in the atria that results in ces-
sation of atrial contraction
■Depolarizations continuously bombard the AV nodal tissue, which acts as a filter and
does not allow all depolarizations to conduct to the ventricles.
 Many atrial depolarizations activate only a part of the atria because the rapid rate
renders portions of the atria refractory, and thus they cannot reach the AV
junction.
 Other atrial impulses penetrate into the AV junctional tissue but are not robust
enough to penetrate the entire length. Blocked impulses affect the conduction prop-
erties of the AV junctional tissue and alter conduction of subsequent electrical
impulses; electrical impulses are conducted through the AV junction irregularly
producing an irregular ventricular rhythm.
Atrial Flutter
■ Probably originates from one site of reentry that moves continuously throughout the
atrial myocardium and frequently and regularly stimulates the AV node. When the
atrial rate becomes sufficiently fast, the refractory period of the AV node exceeds
the cycle length (P to P interval) of the SVT, and some atrial depolarizations are
blocked from traversing the AV node (functional second-degree AV block).
Systems Affected
Cardiovascular
■ Loss of atrial contraction may result in decreased stroke volume and cardiac output
depending on heart rate.
■ High heart rate may result in deterioration in myocardial function (tachycardia-
induced myocardial failure).
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Species
■ Dogs and cats
70
BLAC KWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Breed Predilections
■ Large- and giant-breed dogs are more prone to primary atrial fibrillation.
General Comments
Signs generally relate to the underlying disease process or CHF rather than the
arrhythmia itself, but previously stable animals may decompensate.
Patients with primary atrial fibrillation are generally asymptomatic but may demon-
strate mild exercise intolerance.
Historical Findings
Coughing/respiratory difficulty/tachypnea
■Exercise intolerance
■Rarely syncope
■ Dogs with primary atrial fbrillation are typically asymptomatic.
Physical Examination Findings
■ On auscultation, patients with atrial fibrillation have an erratic heart rhythm that
sounds like “"tennis shoes in a dryer" or "jungle drums."
■ First heart sound intensity in atrial fibrillation is variable; second heart sound only
heard on beats with effective ejection, not on every beat
■ Third heart sounds (gallop sounds) may be present.
■ Patients with atrial fibrillation have pulse deficits and variable pulse quality.
■Signs of CHF often present (e.g., cough, respiratory distress, cyanosis)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Frequent atrial (supraventricular) premature depolarizations
■ SVT with AV block
DIAGNOSTICS
Imaging
■Echocardiography and radiography may characterize type and severity of the under-
lying cardiac disease; moderate to severe left atrial enlargement common.
■ Iypically normal in patients with primary atrial fibrillation, although mild left
atrial enlargement may accompany the hemodynamic alterations imposed by the
arrhythmia.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND ATRIAL FLUTTER
¥71
Pathologic Findings
■Depend on underlying cause
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Digoxin, β-adrenergic blockers, and calcium channel blockers (diltiazem) are fre-
quently used to slow conduction through the AV node; definition of an adequate
 heart rate response varies among clinicians, but in dogs is generally 140 to 160 beats
 per minute.
Dogs
 Digoxin—maintenance oral dose 0.005 to 0.0l mg/kg PO every 12 hours; to achieve
a therapeutic serum concentration more rapidly the maintenance dose can be
doubled for the first day. If digoxin is administered alone and the heart rate remains
high, check the digoxin level and adjust the dose to bring the level into the thera-
peutic range. If the heart rate remains high, consider adding a calcium channel
blocker or a β-adrenergic blocker.
■ Diltiazem—initially administered at a dose of 0.5mg/kg PO every 8 hours, then
titrated up to a maximum of 1.5 mg/kg PO every 8 hours or until an adequate
response is obtained.
■ Either high-dose oral quinidine or electrical cardioversion can be used to convert
primary atrial fibrillation into sinus rhythm. Quinidine doses as high as 20 mg/kg PO
every 2 hours can be used safely if monitored closely; doses lower than 12.5 mg/kg
every 6 hours are generally ineffective.
Cats
 Diltiazem (1-2.5 mg/kg PO every 8 hours) or atenolol (6.25-12.5 mg PO every 12-24
hours) are the drugs of choice in most cats.
■ If the heart rate is not sufficiently slowed with these drugs or if myocardial failure
is present, digoxin (0.005 mg/kg PO every 24-48 hours) can be added.
Precautions/Interactions
 Calcium channel blockers and β-adrenergic blockers, both negative inotropes, should
be used cautiously in animals with myocardial failure.
■ Using high-dose oral quinidine for conversion into sinus rhythm carries a risk of
quinidine toxicity (e.g., hypotension, weakness, ataxia, and seizures); administration
of diazepam IV controls seizures; other signs abate within several hours of discon-
tinuing quinidine.
■ Quinidine raises the digoxin level, generally necessitating a digoxin dose
reduction.
72
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Alternative Drugs
 Propranolol—initially administered at a dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg PO every 8 hours,
then titrated upward until an adequate response is obtained. Do not exceed a dose
of 0.5 mg/kg PO every 8 hour. Propranolol is poorly tolerated when used chronically
and also affects β receptors and is therefore rarely used.
Diet
■Mild to moderate sodium restriction if CHF
Activity
■ Restrict activity until tachycardia is controlled.
Appropriate Health Care
■ Patients with fast (secondary) atrial fibrillation are treated medically to slow the
ventricular rate. Converting the atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm would be ideal,
but such attempts in patients with severe underlying heart disease or left atrial
enlargement are generally futile because of a low success rate and high rate of
recurrence
■Consider quinidine or electrical cardioversion to sinus rhythm for a dog with primary
atrial fibrillation.
■ Patients with primary atrial fibrillation may be converted back to normal sinus
rhythm. The success rate depends on chronicity. Patients which have been in atrial
fibrillation for fewer than 4 months generally have a lower success rate and a higher
rate of recurrence. In these patients, rate control, if necessary, is the recommended
treatment.
■ Electrical (DC) cardioversionapplication of a transthoracic electrical shock at a
specific time in the cardiac cycle; requires special equipment, trained personnel, and
general anesthesia. A small (l0 joules) electrical shock may suffice, but most require
higher power (50-150 joules). Biphasic DC cardioversion consistently cardioverts
with lower power (<50 joules).
Nursing Care
■ As indicated for CHF
COMMENTS
Client Education
■Secondary atrial fibrillation is usually associated with severe underlying heart disease;
 goal of therapy is to lower heart rate and control clinical signs.
■ Sustained conversion to sinus rhythm is unlikely with secondary atrial fibrillation.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND ATRIAL FLUTTER
73
Patient Monitoring
■ Monitor heart rate and ECG closely.
■]
Because heart rates in the hospital and those measured on the surface ECG may be
inaccurate (due to patient anxiety and other environmental factors), Holter monitor-
ing provides a more accurate means for assessing the need for heart rate control or
the efficacy of medical therapy for heart rate control.
Possible Complications
■ Worsening of cardiac function with onset of arrhythmia
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Secondary atrial fibrillation—associated with severe heart disease, so a guarded-to-
 poor prognosis
■ Primary atrial fibrillation with normal ultrasound findings—generally a good
prognosis

Atrial Standstill
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
ECG rhythm characterized by absence of P waves
Condition can be temporary (e.g., associated with hyperkalemia or drug induced),
terminal (e.g., associated with severe hyperkalemia or dying heart), or persistent.
Electrocardiogram Features
Persistent Atrial Standstill (Figure 10.1)
■P waves absent
Heart rate usually slow (<60 beats per minute)
 Rhythm regular with supraventricular type QRS complexes
■Heart rate does not increase with atropine administration.
Hyperkalemic Atrial Standstill
■Heart rate normal or slow
Rhythm regular or irregular
QRS complexes tend to be wide and become wider as the potassium level rises; with
severe hyperkalemia (potassium >l0 mEq/mL), the QRS complexes are replaced by
a smooth biphasic curve.
Heart rate may increase slightly with atropine.

■  Rare condition caused by an atrial muscular dystrophy; skeletal muscle involvement

Hyperkalemic Atrial Standstill
 Generally occurs with serum potassium levels >8.5 mEq/L; value influenced by serum
sodium and calcium levels and acid-base status. Patients who are hyperkalemic
with atrial standstill have sinus node function, but impulses do not activate atrial
myocytes; thus, the associated rhythm is termed a sinoventricular rhythm. Because
the sinus node is functional, an irregular rhythm may be due to sinus arrhythmia

THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
Persistent Atrial Standstill
■ Treat with diuretics and ACE inhibitor (e.g., enalapril or benazepril) if CHF
develops.
Hyperkalemic Atrial Standstill
 Treat the underlying cause (e.g., oliguric renal failure, hypoadrenocorticism).
Aggressive fluid therapy with 0.9% saline and possibly sodium bicarbonate or insulin
with dextrose as will be discussed
translocation of potassium into cells; if blood pH and base deficit cannot be deter
mined, administer 1 to 2 mEq/kg slowly IV. To calculate bicarbonate dose more
accurately:
■Dogs: 0.3 × body weight (kg) × (21—patient's HCO3)
■Cats: 0.3 × body weight (kg) ×(19—patient's HCO3)
■ Administer half of dose and reevaluate.
■Can administer dextrose and regular insulin to patients with severe hyperkalemia to
induce translocation of potassium into cells (regular insulin, 0.5U/kg IV with 50%
dextrose, l g/kg IV); dextrose can also be used without insulin; follow insulin and
dextrose administration with 2.5% dextrose as a CR1 to prevent hypoglycemia.
 For patients with life-threatening hyperkalemia, administer calcium gluconate 10%
(0.5-1 ml/kg slowly IV over 10 minutes) while monitoring the ECG; calcium antago-
nizes the effect of potassium on the conduction system without lowering the potas-
sium concentration.
Precautions/Interactions
■Avoid potassium-containing fluids or medications that increase potassium concentra-
tion in patients who are hyperkalemic.
■ Diuretics lower preload and may worsen weakness in dogs with persistent atrial
standstill and CHF unless a pacemaker has been implanted.
ATRIAL STANDSTILL
79
Activity
■ Restrict activity in patients with persistent atrial standstill and signs of CHF or
syncope.
Surgical Considerations

Atrioventricular (AV) Block
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
AV block refers to a delay or block of impulse conduction from the atria to the ven-
tricles at a time when the conduction system is not refractory.
 Conduction delay or block may arise at any site between the sinoatrial node and the
ventricular myocardium (i.e., intra-atrial, intranodal, or subnodal block).
While certain ECG patterns of AV block more typically reflect impaired conduction
in one particular segment of the cardiac conduction system, overlap occurs, and it
is often impossible to determine with certainty which part of the conduction system
is responsible for the block based on the surface ECG.
■AV block is classified into three  categories based on electrocardiographic
characteristics:
1. First-degree AV block refers to delayed AV conduction.
■ The ECG shows a l:1 relationship of P waves and QRS complexes with a pro-
longed PR interval (>0.13 seconds in dogs and >0.09 seconds in cats).
■ QRS and T waves usually appear normal (Figure ll.1).
2. Second-degree AV block occurs when there is failure of some, but not all, P waves
to be conducted to the ventricles; three patterns of second-degree AV block are
recognized.
■ Mobitz Type I (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block is characterized by
 gradual prolongation of PR intervals until a P wave fails to conduct (Figure
11.2).
■Mobitz Type Il second-degree AV block is characterized by abrupt failure of
one or more consecutive P waves to be conducted without progressive length-
ening of the PR interval prior to the blocked P wave (Figure 1l.3).
High-grade second-degree AV block is characterized by a fixed ratio of P waves
to QRS complexes, for example, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 (Figure 11.4). (This type of sec-
ond-degree AV block cannot be classified as Type I or Type I1.)
 QRS and I waves appear normal unless there is also an intraventricular conduc-
tion abnormality.
3. Third-degree (complete) AV block is the result of complete absence of AV
conduction.
■ Characterized on ECG (in patients with sinus rhythm or other organized atrial
rhythm) as a complete lack of association of P waves and QRs complexes with
the ventricular rate slower than the atrial rate

the dog also has right bundle branch block (paper speed = 25mm/s).
■ Because ventricular depolarization arises from escape activity of a subsidiary
intraventricular pacemaker, QRs complexes are typically wide and bizarre
(Figure 1l.5).
■ In many cats and some dogs, the escape focus is near the origin of the His
bundle (in the region defined as the AV junction), and in these animals, the
QRS complexes are narrow (Figure 1l.6)-

ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
A variety of disorders or disease processes may cause impaired AV conduction, and
the severity of impairment may range from first-degree to complete AV block in each
of these circumstances.
■AV block may be transient or permanent.
■AV block may progress from first-degree to more severe block.
■AV block may result from intrinsic disease of the cardiac conduction system or from
extrinsic factors adversely affecting impulse conduction.
  e s      s   s
1 Vagal stimulation is a common cause of AV conduction block in the critical care
setting.
■ Second-degree AV block occurs in 64 percent of healthy adult dogs and 100
percent of healthy pups between 8 and ll weeks of age.
■ Vagal tone is increased during sleep; therefore, AV block may disappear during
waking hours and with resumption of normal activity.
■Valsalva maneuvers may also result in transient AV block.
 BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
 Enhanced vagal tone in dogs and cats may be associated with conditions such as
upper airway disease, cervical and thoracic masses, gastrointestinal disorders,
head or neck trauma, increased CsF pressure, and glaucoma.
■ Electrolyte imbalances may predispose to or cause AV block (hyperkalemia directly
impairs AV conduction, whereas hypokalemia enhances the effect of vagal
stimulation).
■ Other extrinsic causes of AV conduction block include drugs or toxins such as
cardiac glycosides, β-adrenergic antagonists, calcium channel blocking agents,
propafenone, amiodarone, Q-adrenergic agonists, parasympathomimetic agents, or
severe procainamide or quinidine toxicity.
■ Iransient potentiation of AV block may be seen following administration of
atropine, and bradycardic potentiation is longer in duration with subcutaneous
administration.
■AV block as a result of disorders of the cardiac conduction system include:
 Degeneration of the conduction system (AVN, bundle of His, or bundle branches)
with or without degenerative mitral valve disease
■ Inflammation affecting the AVN, atrial approaches to the AVN, or Purkinje system
 including bacterial endocarditis of the aortic valve and myocarditis (Borrelia burg-
dorferi, Irypanosoma cruzi, Rickettsia rickettsi, tetanus, lymphocytic-plasmacytic
myocarditis)
■Infiltrative diseases (tumors, amyloid)
■Cardiomyopathy
■ Congenital AV block associated with structural defects (e.g.、 atrioventricular
(     r d  ( p
■ Severe systemic hypertension
 Blunt chest trauma
 Ischemia or infarction (rare)

■  Cats of any age with hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Any condition or intervention that increases vagal tone
Historical Findings
■
 Many animals are asymptomatic
 Syncope or collapse
■Exercise intolerance
 Occasionally seizures
May have a variety of clinical signs resulting from underlying cause
CLINICAL FEATURES
Physical Examination Findings
Normal with first-degree AV block (unless there are also abnormalities resulting from
more generalized myocardial disease or noncardiac disease).
 Intermittent pauses in the cardiac rhythm with Mobitz Type I or Type Il second-
degree AV block
 Bradycardia if high-grade second-degree or third-degree block
 Jugular veins may show intermittent cannon A waves with third-degree block
 First heart sound (Sl) may become progressively softer, followed by a pause with
Mobitz Type I second-degree AV block.
■ An audible S4 may be heard unaccompanied by Sl and S2 when block occurs
(second- and third-degree AV block)
 A systolic ejection murmur resulting from relative aortic stenosis may be heard in
patients with bradycardia.
 Secondary neurologic signs (e.g., seizures, extensor rigidity) may be noted in animals
with severe bradycardia.
 Premature beats or paroxysms of tachycardia secondary to myocardial hypoperfusion
may be audible in animals with severe bradycardia.
 Other abnormalities reflecting the underlying etiology may be observed.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Sinus node dysfunction (sick sinus syndrome)
■ Atrial standstill
86  BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■Accelerated idioventricular rhythm
should be differentiated from bifid T waves.
 Nonconducted P waves from supraventricular premature impulses or supraventricu-
lar tachycardia should be distinguished from second-degree AV block
DIAGNOSTICS
■Standard electrocardiography
■ Continuous ECG monitoring or recording (e.g., Holter monitoring, event recording.
telemetry) may be required if conduction impairment is intermittent.
■May be necessary to identify specific noncardiac causes of enhanced vagal tone.
■ Atropine response test may be used to determine whether AV block is due to vagal
tone (administer atropine 0.04 mg/kg IM and repeat ECG in 20-30 minutes).
■ Hyperkalemia and hypokalemia may predispose to AV conduction disturbances.
■ Abnormal leukogram may be noted in animals with bacterial endocarditis or
myocarditis.
■Serum digoxin concentration may be high.
■High Ta in cats if associated with thyrotoxic myocardial disease
■ Abnormally high arterial blood pressure if associated with severe hypertension or
hypertensive cardiac disease.
■ Positive Borrelia, Rickettsia, or Irypanosoma cruzi titers if associated with one of these
infectious agents
■Blood cultures may be positive in patients with bacterial endocarditis.
■ Electrophysiologic studies are generally unnecessary but can be done to confirm the
specific type of AV block if surface ECG findings are equivocal and to identify the
specific intracardiac location of the conduction block.
■ Doppler/echocardiographic examination may reveal structural heart disease (e.g..
endocarditis, neoplasia, cardiomyopathy).
Pathologic Findings
■No gross or histopathologic abnormalities if AV block is due to extrinsic causes.
■ With cardiac conduction system disorders findings may vary depending on the
underlying cause.
■ Older animals with degenerative change of the conduction system may have focal
mineralization of the interventricular septal crest visible grossly; chondroid metapla-
sia of the central fibrous body and increased fibrous connective tissue in the AV
bundle are noted histopathologically.
THERAPEUTICS
■ The overall objectives of treatment are to eliminate or reverse the underlying cause
and to provide a heart rate support when necessary.

Drug(s) of choice
■ Medications are chosen if appropriate to manage an underlying cardiac or noncardiac
condition.
 Temporary or permanent cardiac pacing may be the only consistently effective treat-
ment in symptomatic patients or patients with progressive renal dysfunction due to
bradyarrhythmia
be used short term if positive atropine response.
■Chronic anticholinergic therapy (propantheline 0.5-2.0 mg/kg PO every 8-12 hours
or hyoscyamine 0.003-0.006 mg/kg every 8 hours) for symptomatic patients if
improved AV conduction documented with atropine response test.
 Isoproterenol (0.04-0.09 μg/kg per minutes IV to effect) or dopamine (3-5μg/kg per
minute IV to effect) may be administered in acute, life-threatening situations to
enhance AV conduction or accelerate an escape focus.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Hypokalemia—increases sensitivity to vagal tone; may potentiate AV conduction
delay
■ Drugs with vagomimetic action (e.g., digoxin, bethanechol, physostigmine, and
pilocarpine) may cause or potentiate AV block.
  Avoid drugs likely to impair impulse conduction further or depress a ventricular
escape focus (e.g. procainamide, quinidine, lidocaine, calcium channel blocking
agents, β-adrenergic antagonists, Q-adrenergic agonists, amiodarone, and
propafenone).
 Temporary cardiac pacing may induce pacemaker dependency by suppressing an
escape focus.
■ Avoid the use of isoproterenol or dopamine in patients with digoxin toxicity or
ischemic heart disease.
Diet
■  Modifications or restrictions only to manage an underlying condition
Activity
 Cage rest advised for symptomatic patients
Surgical Considerations
■ Many patients are a high anesthetic risk, and perioperative temporary pacing is
advised if anesthesia is needed.
 Permanent artificial cardiac pacemaker may be required for long-term management
of symptomatic patients or those with progressive renal dysfunction due to
bradyarrhythmia.
■ For patients needing a permanent pacemaker, an epicardial system should be con-
sidered in those with existing or potential hypercoagulable state, those requiring
immunosuppression for a comorbid state, those with sepsis, and feline patients
COMMENTS
Client Education
■  Explain that treatment is directed toward underlying cause.
■  Explain that cardiac pacing will not prevent progression of underlying heart disease
if present.
Patient Monitoring
■ Asymptomatic patients without a pacemaker must be monitored for development
of clinical signs, secondary congestive heart failure, and progressive renal
dysfunction.
■ Monitor ECG of patients with first-degree AV block or low-grade second-degree AV
block for development of higher grade conduction block.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Depends on underlying cause
■  Prognosis for first-degree and Mobitz Type I second-degree AV block is usually excel-
lent if no significant underlying disease is present.
■AV block may be reversible if due to medications, transient ischemia, blunt trauma,
hypertension, electrolyte disorders, or acute myocarditis of any cause.
■ Conditions that cause necrosis, disruption, or replacement of the cardiac conduction
system cells typically result in progressive and permanent AV block (e.g., infarction,
surgical disruption, radiofrequency ablation, bacterial endocarditis, neoplasia, amy-
loidosis, progressive muscular dystrophy, or cardiomyopathy).
■With high-grade second-degree or complete AV block sudden death may occur.

Blood Transfusion Reaction
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ An adverse effect resulting from a blood or blood component transfusion
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Transfusion reactions are either acute (within 48 hours of administration) or delayed.
and can result from immune-mediated or nonimmune-mediated causes. Transfusion
reactions can range from mild and subclinical to severe and life-threatening.
Acute Immune-Mediated Reactions
bodies against the RBCs in the transfusion. IgM and IgG are able to fix complement
and cause intravascular hemolysis. Extravascular hemolysis occurs with removal of
antibody-coated RBCs by the lymphoreticular system. Dogs require previous expo-
sure to develop antibodies; cats possess naturally occurring alloantibodies and may
develop acute hemolysis with their first transfusion.
 An allergic reaction (type I hypersensitivity) results from antigen binding with the
recipient's IgE or IgG. Antigen-antibody interaction causes degranulation of mast
cells, release of numerous vasoactive compounds, systemic inflammation, and
vasodilation. Donor leukocytes in the transfusion may also degranulate during
storage.
■  A febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction is caused by interaction of antigens on
donor leukocytes or platelets with recipient antibodies or by release of pyrogenic
cytokines during storage.
Delayed Immune-Mediated Reactions
 Delayed hemolysis occurs when the recipient develops antibodies from exposure to
foreign RBC antigens in the transfusion. These antibodies adhere to transfused RBCs
and cause extravascular hemolysis

secondary to foreign platelet antigens in a transfusion.

BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Acute Nonimmune-Mediated Reactions
■ Hemolysis of donor RBCs before transfusion is caused by improper storage (i.e.,

rapid infusion, and infusion through some fluid pumps).
■ Bacterial contamination from improper collection or storage, donor bacteremia, skin
contamination, or contamination during administration may lead to septic shock.
DIC, and MODS.
■ Volume overload can occur with transfusion at an excessive rate or volume because
blood products are colloidal suspensions that primarily contribute to intravascular
fluid volume. Hypervolemia increases pulmonary capillary pressure and can lead to
pulmonary edema.
■ Citrate toxicosis may result from administration of large volumes of whole blood.

■ Hyperammonemia from administration of outdated blood products will cause signs
of CNS toxicity and can also cause vomiting.
■ Hypothermia can be caused or exacerbated by administration of blood products that

generally milder signs with extravascular hemolysis, vomiting, diarrhea, pyrexia,
tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, dysrhythmias, seizures
 Allergic reactions—pyrexia, erythema, urticaria, pruritus, angioneurotic edema,
vomiting、 diarrhea, and possible anaphylaxis with hypotension, tachycardia, and
bronchoconstriction
■ Febrile nonhemolytic reaction—temperature increase of >l° C, pyrexia may persist
for up to 20 hours
 Delayed hemolysis—typically mild decrease in PCV without hemoglobinuria
■ Posttransfusion purpura—petechiae, ecchymoses, spontaneous hemorrhage, usually
7 to 14 days post-transfusion
■ Nonimmune-mediated hemolysis—typically  benign but reduced efficacy of the
transfusion
 Bacterial contamination—pyrexia, vomiting, hemolysis, septic shock
■ Volume overload—tachypnea, moist cough, orthopnea, cyanosis
■ Citrate toxicosis—-tremors, tetany, nausea, hypotension, dysrhythmias
■Hyperammonemia—ataxia, dementia, head pressing, circling, seizures, vomiting
■ Hypothermia—decrease in body temperature, dysrhythmias
Risk Factors/Causes
■Transfusion carries an inherent risk of reaction.
■ Acute hemolysis—previous transfusion or pregnancy
 Allergic reactions—worse with plasma or platelet transfusions
■ Febrile nonhemolytic reaction—risk increases with storage time of the product
Bacterial contamination—platelet products. which may be stored at room
temperature
■ Volume overload—cats, neonates, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, oliguric/
anuric renal failure, whole blood transfusions and infusion of hemoglobin-based
oxygen carriers (e.g. Oxyglobin) tend to be of a larger volume
94
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Citrate toxicosis—hepatic dysfunction, whole blood transfusion, rapid or large-
volume transfusion
■Hyperammonemia—hepatic dysfunction, ammonia levels in blood products increase
with storage time
■ Hypothermia—large volume transfusion, transfusion through a central line
7
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Although acute transfusion reactions may appear similar clinically, correct diagnosis
is necessary for appropriate treatment. If a reaction is suspected, confirm product-
recipient compatibility, expiration date, and evaluate the appearance of the product
for signs of contamination. The presence of hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria
strongly suggests hemolysis but may be absent with extravascular hemolysis.
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
■ PCVrapid decline with acute hemolysis, mild-to-marked decrease with delayed
hemolysis, pink- to red-tinged plasma portion
■ Thrombocytopenia—mild to marked with posttransfusion purpura
Hemoglobinemia/hemoglobinuria—acute hemolysis
■ Hyperbilirubinemia—acute or delayed hemolysis
Other Laboratory Tests
■ Coombs' test—positive in delayed hemolytic reactions but may be positive from
primary disease
Gram stain and culture-if bacterial contamination is suspected
■ Ionized calcium—low with citrate toxicosis
■  Ammonia level—high with hyperammonemia but difficult to test
Imaging
■  Thoracic radiographs—confirm volume overload, patchy interstitial to alveolar lung
pattern, can develop anywhere, but more common in the perihilar region
Diagnostic Procedures
■  Cross-match—confirm compatibility

Central venous pressure—sharp increase with volume overload
 ECG—bradycardia, Q-T interval prolongation, and VPCs with citrate toxicosis
THERAPEUTICS
The transfusion should immediately be discontinued whenever a reaction is sus-
pected and the patient fully evaluated to determine appropriate treatment.
 Acute hemolysis—discontinue transfusion, support systemic blood pressure with
roids not generally indicated
Allergic reactions—discontinue or decrease rate of transfusion, antihistamine ± cor-
ticosteroid; epinephrine, oxygen supplementation, intravenous fluid therapy and
vasopressors may be needed with anaphylaxis
Febrile nonhemolytic reaction—decrease rate of transfusion, medications usually not
necessary but consider antihistamines ± NSAIDs
Delayed hemolysis—therapy usually not indicated, additional transfusions may be
required with severe anemia
Bacterial contamination—discontinue transfusion, broad-spectrum intravenous anti-
biotic therapy
■ Volume overload—discontinue or decrease rate of transfusion, oxygen supplementa-
tion, diuretic therapy
 Citrate toxicosis—discontinue or decrease rate of transfusion, slow administration
of intravenous calcium
Drug(s) of Choice
 Allergic reaction—diphenhydramine (2 mg/kg IM) ± a short-acting corticosteroid if
signs progress or do not improve, epinephrine (0.0l to 0.02 mg/kg SQ, IM, or IV)
for anaphylaxis
■  Posttransfusion purpura—-immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids in severe cases
■ Volume overload—furosemide (24 mg/kg IV, repeat every 30 minutes until clinical
signs of orthopnea resolve)
■Citrate toxicosis—calcium gluconate (94-140 mg/kg slowly IV)
Contraindictions
■Avoidusing
corticosteroids or NSAIDs in patients with gastrointestinal
hemorrhage.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Administration of calcium in the same line with blood products may cause clot or
precipitate formation.
96
COMMENTS
Patient Monitoring
■ Quick recognition allows earlier and more successful treatment of transfusion reac-
tions. Baseline temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and CRT at baseline and every
15 minutes for the first hour then hourly until transfusion is complete
■ Pre- and posttransfusion PCV
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Critically assess the patient's needs and avoid transfusion if not clinically
warranted.
■ When taking history ask about previous transfusion and prominently note transfu-
sion history in patient records.
 Confirm donor-recipient compatibility by typing or cross-matching.
■ Choose the appropriate blood product containing only needed components with
minimal antigen and volume.
■ Do not administer products that are outdated or abnormal in appearance.
 Administer blood products with proper equipment.
■  Leukoreduction (removal of leukocytes from a blood product) may reduce the likeli-
hood of a febrile nonhemolytic reaction.
■ Bacterial contamination can be prevented by aseptic collection technique, sterile
collection equipment, and proper storage.
■ Suffciently warm blood products with an approved warming device
Thorough screening of donors for potential infectious diseases
 Prophylactic administration of antihistamines or glucocorticoids is controversial but
not supported by scientific evidence and is not recommended at this time.

Brachial Plexus Injury
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
TBPI is a catch-all term that refers to traumatically induced neuropathy of the C6-T2
ventral spinal nerve rami.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Its projections comprise the suprascapular (C6-C7), subscapular (C6-C7), muscu-
locutaneous (C6-C8), axillary (C6-C8), radial (C6-I2), median (C8-T2),ulnar
(C8-T2), and lateral thoracic (C8-Tl) nerves.
■ Thoracic limb traction or abduction can result in injury to the brachial plexus or
associated structures.
 Injury can lead to neuropraxia (focal demyelination without axonal disruption),
axonotomesis (axonal injury with sparing of the endoneureum), or neurototomesis
(complete severance of axons and ensheathing tissues).
When neurototomesis occurs, it is often at the level of the nerve rootlets, and results
in brachial plexus avulsion.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Young, male, large breed dogs with unsupervised outdoor access are likely
predisposed.
CLINICAL FEATURES
   (       
■ Ventral rootlets and associated motor fibers are most susceptible to TBPl, although
sensory projections can be affected in severe injuries.
66
100
Cranial Traumatic Brachial Plexus Injury
■ Lesions associated with the cranial brachial plexus will result in difficulty advancing
 the limb at the shoulder (suprascapular nerve), shoulder instability (suprascapular,
subscapular nerves), and weak elbow flexion (musculocutaneous nerve).
■ Animals with cranial TBPl usually have the ability to bear weight and extend the
elbow as the majority of the radial distribution will be spared.
■ Postural reactions may be weak, although sparing of the knuckling response is
common.
■ The extensor carpi radialis and triceps reflexes are likely to be preserved, whereas
the biceps and flexor withdrawal reflexes may be weak
            
of the C6-C8 nerve roots leads to analgesia in the autonomous zone of the axillary
nerve (lateral brachium), musculocutaneous nerve (craniomedial antebrachium), and
portions of the radial nerve (cranial antebrachium, dorsum of paw) (Figure 13.1)

BRACHIAL PLEXUS INJURY
101
 Caudal Traumatic Brachial Plexus Injury
■ Caudal TBPl will lead to an inability to bear weight on the thoracic limb and loss of
carpal extension.
■ Proximally located lesions involving the ventral rootlets, ventral roots, or spinal
  n       
■Lesions involving C8-Tl (lateral thoracic nerve) may lead to ipsilateral loss of the
cutaneous trunci reflex.
■ Postural reactions, such as hopping or knuckling, will be weak or absent depending
on the severity of caudal TBPI.
■ Reflexes, including the flexor withdrawal, extensor carpi radialis, and triceps, will
be weak or absent.
Hypalgesia or analgesia may be present in the autonomous zones of the ulnar
(caudal antebrachium) and radial (cranial antebrachium, dorsum of paw) with
C8-T2 TBP1.
Complete Traumatic Brachial Plexus Injury
■ Complete TBPI has the features of both cranial and caudal TBPl, with analgesia to
the entire limb distal to the elbow occurring with severe lesions.
 In some cases of proximally located complete TBPl, postural reaction deficits, upper
motor neuron paresis and ataxia may be present in the ipsilateral pelvic limb due to
hematoma compression of the spinal cord.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Other differential diagnoses for acute onset monoparesis or monoplegia of a thoracic
limb in dogs include:
■ FCE
■ Lateralized disk herniation
■Brachial plexus neuritis (can be bilateral)
■ Infectious neuritis
■ Neoplasia
■Vascular neuromyopathy (brachial artery occlusion)
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Frequently TBPl is diagnosed based on clinical signs and a history of trauma.
■All animals should receive a careful physical examination, with special attention paid
to intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, orthopedic, and neurologic structures that may be
concurrently injured.
102 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
 Animals with a history of significant trauma should have a complete blood count.
serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and chest radiograph series.
■ Those patients with discrete abnormalities in any particular system should have those
investigated appropriately.
■ Advanced imaging, such as CT or MRI, of the brachial plexus, spinal nerves, nerve
rootlets, and spinal cord can help to exclude other etiologies.
■ Electrophysiology. which can include EMG, motor and sensory nerve conduction
velocity, and cord dorsum potentials, can be performed.
■ The value of electrophysiology is that it can identify specific nerve and muscle groups
involved as well as separate neuropraxic injuries from those that involve the axon
and may have a poorer prognosis.
 Electrophysiology is usually performed at least 8 days after injury as in dogs with
axonal damage, because this is the time that it will take to develop abnormal spon-
taneous activity on EMG
■ Electrophysiology does not discern the etiology responsible for neuropathy.
THERAPEUTICS
■Animals with injuries to other body systems should have those addressed.
 Treatment of TBP1 has traditionally consisted of physical rehabilitation and
analgesia.
■ Passive range of motion exercises, active weight bearing. electrical muscle stimula-
tion, and underwater treadmill may all be of benefit.
■  In the acute phase of TBPI opioid analgesia and NSAIDs may be required.
■ Some animals may develop neuropathic pain in the chronic phases of recovery.
manifested by licking or chewing the limb. These animals may require agents such
as gabapentin or tricyclic antidepressants.
■ Steroids are of unknown value in the acute or chronic phases of TBPI
 Animals with absent nociception often do not recover function of the limb and may
need limb amputation.
 Recently, techniques for nerve transposition and re-implantation have been devel.
oped that may improve functional recovery in animals with brachial plexus avulsion.
Unfortunately few veterinary surgeons or neurologists in the United States are able
to perform these procedures

COMMENTS
Client Education
 Recovery of function in distributions that lack nociception is unlikely
 Physical rehabilitation may speed and enhance neurologic improvement.
 Some animals with TBPI will have chronic neuropathic pain.
 Those animals with neuropathic pain that self-mutilate or animals that have abra-
sions from dragging a limb will need to have wounds addressed by a veterinarian.
■ Amputation is sometimes necessary if wounds can not be medically managed.
Patient Monitoring
■ Many animals with TBPI will have other body systems or regions of the nervous
system that may be injured. Careful physical examination is a must.
Possible Complications
 Animals with neuropathic pain may self-mutilate.
■Wound infection
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Prognosis is dependent on nociceptive status and whether lesions are complete or
incomplete.
■ Animals with absent nociception will be unlikely to recovery function in affected
distributions.
■ Animals with complete TBPI are likely to have a more protracted recovery than those
with incomplete lesions.
Synonyms
■ Brachial plexus avulsion is equivalent to complete TBPI

Bundle Branch Block-Left
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Conduction delay or block in both the left posterior and left anterior fascicles of the
left bundle
A supraventricular impulse activates the right ventricle first through the right bundle
branch; the left ventricle is activated late, causing the QRs to become wide and
bizarre.
Electrocardiogram Features
■
QRS prolonged; dogs, >0.08 sec, cats, >0.06 sec
■
QRS wide and positive in leads 1, 11, 1ll, and aVF
■ Block can be intermittent or constant.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Because the left bundle branch is thick and extensive, the lesion causing the block
must be large.
■  Usually an incidental ECG finding—does not cause hemodynamic abnormalities
Risk Factors/Causes
■Cardiomyopathy
■ Direct or indirect cardiac trauma (e.g., hit by car and cardiac needle puncture)
■Neoplasia
 Subvalvular aortic stenosis
■Fibrosis
■ Ischemic cardiomyopathy (e.g., arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries, myocardial
 infarction, and myocardial hypertrophy that obstructs coronary arteries)

supports diagnosis of isolated left bundle branch block.
■ Can also be confused with ventricular ectopic beats, but the PR interval is usually
constant and left bundle branch block has no pulse deficits
DIAGNOSTICS
Imaging
■ Echocardiography may reveal structural heart disease; absence of left-sided heart
enlargement supports a diagnosis of left bundle branch block.
Thoracic and abdominal radiographs may show masses or pulmonary metastatic
lesions.
 Traumatic injuries could result in localized or diffuse pulmonary densities.
Diagnostic Procedures
Electrocardiography
■ Long-term ambulatory monitoring (Holter) may reveal intermittent left bundle
branch block.
Pathologic Findings
 Possible lesions or scarring on endocardial surface in the path of the bundle branches;
applying Lugol's iodine to the endocardial surface within 2 hours postmortem enables
 clear visualization of the conduction system.

BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK—RIGHT
111
Breed Predilections
 In beagles, incomplete right bundle branch block can result from a genetically deter-
mined localized variation in right ventricular wall thickness.
Historical Findings
 Usually an incidental ECG finding-does not cause hemodynamic abnormalities
 Observed signs are usually associated with the underlying condition.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Physical Examination Findings
■ Splitting of heart sounds because of asynchronous activation of ventricles in some
patients
Does not cause signs of hemodynamic compromise
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Right ventricular enlargement—absence of right ventricular enlargement on thoracic
radiographs or echocardiogram supports a diagnosis of right bundle branch block.
 It can also be confused with ventricular ectopic beats (especially if the block is inter-
mittent), but PR intervals are consistent and no pulse deficits with right bundle
branch block.
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
■ None specific
■ Serum potassium may be extremely high in cats with urethral obstruction.
Other Laboratory Tests
 Occult heartworm test may be positive in dogs or cats.
 Chagas' indirect fluorescent antibody test, direct hemagglutination, and complement
fixation test may be positive in dogs.
Imaging
■  Echocardiogram may show structural heart disease; absence of right-sided heart
enlargement supports the diagnosis.
 Thoracic and abdominal radiographs may show masses or pulmonary metastatic
lesions; traumatic injuries could cause localized or diffuse pulmonary densities.

Canine Distemper
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Canine distemper virus infection is among the most serious, contagious, systemic
infections affecting dogs worldwide.
 In nature, the virus is found in a multitude of species. Because of its presence through
many species, opportunity for eradication is minimal.
Vaccination is highly effective and recommended for all dogs beginning at 6 to 8
weeks of age.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Caused by an RNA virus of the genus Morbillivirus.
 Found in a wide range of carnivores, dogs serve as the principal reservoir for CDV
and may be an important source of virus transmitted to wildlife.
■  Viral shedding begins about 7 days post-infection and may be sustained for up to 60
to 90 days.
■ TIransmission occurs most commonly through infectious respiratory secretions but
can be found in most tissues and other secretions of infected animals, including
urine.
Spontaneous infections are most likely to occur in puppies between 3 and 6 months
of age.
Subclinical infection is relatively common; therefore the prevalence of infection is
higher than that of clinical disease. As a result, risk for infection in highest among
puppies that:(a) have contact with other young dogs, (b) do not receive an initial
vaccine series, and (c) are colostrum-deprived (i.e., fail to receive maternally derived
antibody). (NOTE: protection afforded by maternally derived canine distemper anti-
body persists until about 9 to 12 weeks of age in puppies with a normal nursing
history. Depending on the antibody titer of the bitch, the duration of protective
immunity may be more or less than expected.)
■ CDV can be isolated from most tissues/fluids of infected dogs, although epithelium
and CNS tissues are preferentially targeted.
1 Virus is widely disseminated throughout lymphoid tissues by 6 days post-infection;
virus shedding occurs by l4 days post-infection, even in dogs with subclinical
infection.
115
116 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Clinical consequences of CDV infection are largely defined by the degree and type
of immune response the patient is able to mount.
■ By 9 to 14 days post-infection, dogs that mount a poor immune response experience
widespread dissemination of virus that involves the intestinal epithelium, exocrine
and endocrine glands, respiratory tract, genitourinary tract, and even skin.
■ Acute CDV encephalitis can follow hematogenous spread of virus into the CNS and
is most likely to occur in young or immunosuppressed dogs.
■ Acute CDV encephalitis is associated with a poor prognosis for recovery.
■ CDV encephalitis also occurs as a subacute or chronic infection and is associated
with reduced viral replication in the CNs, a relatively strong humoral immune
response, and lack of lymphoid cell depletion.
■ The ability of virus to persist in the CNs may be associated with what is now
described as an uncommon consequence of infection, “old dog encephalitis" (ODE)
or “old dog distemper".
■ Old dog encephalitis is a noncontagious variant of CDV infection that is associated
with progressive inflammatory disease involving grey matter of the cerebral hemi-
spheres and brainstem.
■Minor genetic variation of CDV has been recognized that may explain the variation
in virulence seen in dogs. For example, the Snyder Hill strain of CDV is neurotropic
and causes polioencephalomyelitis. Despite this variation, CDV isolates remain sero-
logically homogeneous.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
          
exposure.
■ Most infections do occur in puppies, particularly those that have not nursed, have
 an inadequate vaccination history, or have been group-housed with other dogs (e.g..
shelters).
■Although transmission typically occurs following exposure to infectious respiratory
secretions, neonatal infections can result following transplacental transmission of
CDV.
■ Affected puppies may be aborted, still-born, or weak at birth.
■ Neurologic signs develop in affected neonates following transplacental exposure
 between 4 and 6 weeks of age, despite mild to inapparent signs in the bitch.
Historical Findings
 Owners of puppies with clinical signs caused by CDV report rapid onset of deteriora-
tion (days) in a previously healthy dog.
■ Clinical signs of CDV can include lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and
thick (purulent) nasal/ocular discharge.
CANINE DISTEMPER
117
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Clinical signs of CDV infection are seldom pathognomonic during initial physical
examination.
■Systemic signs range from mild (lethargy) to severe (seizures).
 The spectrum of acute onset clinical signs includes: fever, dehydration, purulent
nasal and ocular discharge (Figure 16.1), cough, respiratory distress, conjunctivitis,
vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be liquid in consistency and may contain frank
blood or mucus.
 Dogs that survive acute systemic disease can develop a variety of clinical signs.
■
 Skin lesions include pustular dermatitis in puppies, nasal and digital ("hard pad")
hyperkeratosis, and juvenile cellulitis
■ Neurologic signs may develop as early as l to 3 weeks following recovery from sys-
temic illness; onset of neurologic signs may be delayed for several weeks or months.
Depending on the area of the CNS affected, signs include hyperesthesia or cervical
rigidity (meningitis), seizures, vestibular signs, ataxia, paresis, and myoclonus (invol-
untary muscle twitching).
 Bone lesions have been associated with CDV infection in large-breed dogs between
3 and 6 months of age. Long bone lesions consistent with HOD have been associated
with CDV infection and with administration of modified-live virus vaccine.
■ Ocular lesions associated with CDV infection may develop after recovery from
acute systemic disease and include sudden blindness and persistent mydriasis
(optic neuritis), retinal detachment, inactive, circumscribed areas of retinal hyper-
reflectivity ("gold medallion lesions"), and keratoconjunctivitis sicca ("dry eye").

 presentation; acute canine distemper was confirmed
118
 Figure 16.2 Enamel hypoplasia in a young dog that recovered from canine distemper virus infection
■ Enamel hypoplasia, occasionally seen in adult dogs, is evidence of prior CDV infec-
tion (Figure 16.2).
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Because of the wide spectrum of tissues affected, dogs with CDV infection are dif-
ficult to identify on the basis of clinical signs alone.
■ Canine infectious tracheobronchitis is a common differential diagnosis for CDV
 infection in dogs of any age, particularly in non-vaccinates.
■ Because of the prevalence of neurologic signs associated with CDV infection and the
predilection for disease to develop in nonvaccinated puppies, rabies must be consid-
ered a principal differential diagnosis.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Clinical signs of systemic illness consistent with distemper can lead to a presumptive
 diagnosis in puppies 3 to 6 months of age.
■ Confirmation of CDV infection is more problematic, especially in adult dogs.
■ Routine hematology and biochemistry panels may reflect the degree of systemic
illness but are not diagnostic for CDV infection.
■
Examination of peripheral blood smears or exfoliative cytology (e.g., conjunctival
scrapings) for intracellular distemper inclusion bodies is highly diagnostic, particu
larly in the early stages ofinfection (Figure 16.3). (NOTE: use ofa quick Romanowsky-
type stain is recommended over conventional Wright-Giemsa stains for elucidating
distemper inclusions).

stain (recommended) to elucidate inclusion bodies.
 Detection of elevated levels of distemper-specific IgG in CsF is diagnostic of infec-
tion. Distemper vaccination does not cause increased levels of CSF antibody. Detection
of elevated levels of distemper-specific IgG in serum (virus neutralization), however,
is indicative of protection but is not diagnostic of infection.
 Although availability is limited, advanced diagnostic techniques such as immunohis-
tochemistry and detection of CDV RNA in whole blood, serum, and CSF can be used
for antemortem diagnosis of distemper.
Pathologic Findings
■ A wide range of postmortem findings are described in dogs that die from CDV
infection.
■ Common gross lesions include pneumonia, catarrhal enteritis, and evidence of rhi-
nitis, conjunctivitis, and tracheobronchitis. Gross CNS lesions are uncommon.
 Histopathology of CNS tissue demonstrates encephalitis and neuronal demyelination
with or without perivascular inflammation.
  CDV inclusions are typically found in epithelium of mucous membranes and urinary
bladder, leukocytes, and neurons from 5 to 6 weeks post-infection.
THERAPEUTICS
■  Treatment is limited to supportive therapy intended to reduce mortality.
■ Dogs with advanced CNs signs have a poor prognosis for recovery; recommendation
for euthanasia may be justified.
■ Supportive care typically includes oral or intravenous antimicrobials, fluid replace-
ment, and analgesics
■ Ireatment options for neurologic signs are limited and less likely to be effective.
COMMENTS
Client Education
 Clients who have experienced canine distemper infection in a pet should understand
 the importance of administering distemper vaccination prior to bringing the new dog
into the environment, especially if it has been less than l month from the time of
diagnosis or death.
■ CDv does not reside in the environment for extended periods and common disin-
fectants are effective in killing virus.
   I     s       s s
and therefore pose a significant risk to susceptible dogs.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Vaccination of all dogs against CDV is recommended.
■ Iwo vaccine types are available: MLV and rCDV There are no killed CDV
vaccines.
 Current (revised) vaccination recommendations stipulate that puppies should receive
a dose of CDV (usually in combination with parvovirus and adenovirus-2) at 3- t0
4-week intervals beginning as early as 6 weeks of age and ending not earlier than 15
to 16 weeks of age regardless of the product used.
■ All dogs should be revaccinated l year following administration of the last dose in
the initial series. All commercial vaccines provide sustained immunity that lasts
several years; vaccination of adult dogs every 3 years is recommended.
  In high-exposure risk environments and in the face of an outbreak (e.g., shelters),
early vaccination beginning at 3 weeks of age, and every 2 weeks thereafter, is indi-
cated until 15 to16 weeks of age.
 Maternal antibody interference of vaccine is the most common cause of immuniza
tion failure when using MLV CDV vaccine.
■Recombinant distemper (rDistemper) vaccine has been shown to immunize puppies
in the face of maternal antibody and may provide a significant advantage over MLV
vaccines in high-risk environments.

Canine Parvoviral Enteritis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 CPV is a highly contagious disease of immature and poorly vaccinated dogs.
■ CPV affects the GI tract and lymphoid tissues, and if left untreated, is associated with
high morbidity and mortality.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Infection occurs by fecal-oral transmission.
■]
 Incubation period ranges from 3 to 8 days.
 The virus initially replicates in the lymphoid tissues of the oropharynx, then subse-
quently spreads via the bloodstream to rapidly dividing cells of the Gl tract, other
lymphoid tissues (mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, thymus) and bone marrow.
1 CPV affects the germinal epithelium of the intestinal crypts, and results in destruc-
tion of epithelium and impaired normal cell turnover. This, in turn, results in villous
atrophy and sloughing. Bacterial translocation, bacteremia, and endotoxemia are
common sequelae of the impaired Gl mucosal barrier.
 Bone marrow involvement results in leukopenia that is characterized by lymphopenia
and neutropenia.
Systems Affected
■ Gl—vomiting and diarrhea are consequences of destruction of the intestinal crypt
epithelium.
■ Hemic/Lymphatic/Immune—leukopenia occurs secondary  to bone  marrow
involvement.
■ Cardiovascular—rapidly worsening dehydration may progress to signs of shock and
cardiovascular collapse due to large fluid losses.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 Signs and observations often reported by the owner include lethargy, anorexia, vom-
iting, and brown or hemorrhagic diarrhea.
123

BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Risk Factors/Causes
Overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, intestinal parasitism and lack of protective
immunity.
■ Any breed may be affected, but the following breeds are at increased risk:
■ American pit bull terrier, Doberman pinscher, Rottweiler, Labrador retriever, and
 German shepherd dog. It is not apparent whether a genetic predisposition exists,
as opposed to breed popularity or increased proportion of unvaccinated dogs in
these breeds.
■ Puppies between 6 weeks and 6 months of age are most commonly affected. In dogs
older than 6 months of age, intact males are twice as likely to acquire CPV infection
as intact females.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Depression/lethargy (Figure 17.l)
■Fever
■ Dehydration characterized by tacky mucous membranes. prolonged skin tent.
sunken eyes. Frequently, dehydration may progress to clinical signs of shock that
include poor pulse quality, tachycardia, tachypnea, prolonged CRT, cool
extremities.
■ Painful abdomen; a mass effect may be palpable if intussusception is present.

DIAGNOSTICS
■ Fecal ELISA antigen test is a practical cage-side test that has good sensitivity and
specificity (Figure 17.2).
■ False-positives may occur within 5 to 12 days of administration of an attenuated
vaccine.
■ False-negative results may be seen due to a short period of fecal CPV shedding.
 Figure 17.2 Fecal antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a quick and convenient bedside
diagnostic test for canine parvovirus infections.
 Fecal PCR—-highly sensitive and specific; can aid in distinguishing between a vaccine
and virulent strains of CPV; is not routinely commercially available.
■ Serology—-positive results are not diagnostic for an active CPV infection, as 25 to 90
percent of healthy animals may be seropositive secondary to a previous subclinical
infection. Detection of IgM antibodies combined with suggestive clinical signs is
necessary for diagnosis.
■ Immunochemistry latex agglutination, viral isolation, and electron microscopy may
be used to demonstrate virus in tissue culture, feces, or tissues. These tests require
specialized diagnostic laboratories.
Pathologic Findings
■ Gross findings: thickening and segmental discoloration of distal duodenum, jejunum
and ileum; denudation of intestinal mucosa; abdominal lymphadenopathy.
■ Microscopic findings: shortening and obliteration of intestinal villi; crypt epithelial
necrosis; necrosis of lymphoid tissues (spleen, thymus, Peyer's patches, mesenteric
lymph nodes); viral intranuclear inclusion bodies may be visualized in epithelium
of the Gl tract.
THERAPEUTICS
■ The objectives of treatment are correction of dehydration or shock, restoration of
fluid and electrolyte balance, prevention or treatment of secondary bacterial infec-
tion, and aggressive supportive care while the Gl tract is recovering.
■ Intravenous fluid administration is the mainstay of therapy of CPV infections. High
fluid rates are frequently required because of severe fluid depletion and significant
ongoing losses in form of vomiting and diarrhea. If an animal is in shock, an initial
fluid bolus of 20 to 30 ml/kg of a balanced isotonic crystalloid solution over 15 to
30 minutes is indicated, followed by reassessment of perfusion parameters (i.e., heart
rate, CRT, blood pressure) to determine if additional fluid resuscitation is required.
The goal of resuscitation is return to normal hemodynamic parameters (i.e., blood
pressure, mucous membrane color, CRT, heart rate). If an intravenous fluid bolus is
not required or after it has been completed, the fluid rate may be determined by
approximating the animal's fluid deficit (percent dehydration × body weight [kg])
and replacing it over 12 to 24 hours, adding on maintenance needs (2-4 ml/kg per
hour) and ongoing fluid losses; typical fluid rates average --l0 ml/kg per hour.
■  If crystalloid solutions fail to restore perfusion, if total protein levels decrease to
below 4 g/dl, or if a patient develops signs of peripheral edema, synthetic colloids are
indicated. A 3 to 5 ml/kg bolus may be given to an animal in shock; alternatively, an
infusion at the rate of l ml/kg per hour may be administered if a bolus is not indi-
cated. Traditionally, a total dose of colloids should not exceed 20 to 30 ml/kg per
day; however, in patients that are critically ill that require very high fluid rates this
limit may be exceeded, if necessary.
CANINEPARVOVIRAL ENTERITIS127
Drug(s) of choice
Antibiotics
■ Indicated due to destruction of the GI mucosal barrier and high potential for bacte-
rial translocation, as well as leukopenia, which may predispose the animal to second-
ary bacterial infections
■Combination therapy may be used to provide broad-spectrum coverage: beta lactam
(ampicillin 22 mg/kg IV, SQ every 68 hours) and fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin IV
SQ 10-15 mg/kg every 24 hours) or aminoglycoside (gentamicin 6.6mg/kg IV, SQ
every 24 hours); see Precautions/Interactions.
Single agent broad-spectrum antibiotics may be used, such as cefoxitin (15-
30 mg/kg IV, SQ every 6 hours) or ampicillin/sulbactam (22 mg/kg IV, SQ every 8
hours)
Anti-Emetics
 If vomiting or nausea persists, antiemetic therapy is indicated. The following medica-
tions may also be used alone or in combination with each other:
 Serotonin antagonists (dolasetron 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours)
■ Maripotant (l mg/kg SQ every 24 hours for 5 days); not approved for use in dogs
under l6 weeks.
■ Phenothiazine derivatives (chlorpromazine 0.1-0.5 mg/kg IM, SQ every 8 -12
hours); see Precautions/Interactions.
■ Metoclopramide—intermittent injections (0.1-0.4 mg/kg SQ every 6 hours), an
intravenous CRl constant rate infusion (l-2 mg/kg per day); see Precautions/
Interactions.
Pain Medications
 As some animals with CPV infections may exhibit significant abdominal pain, pain
management is a useful adjunct to therapy. Opioid medications may be used, such
as buprenorphine (0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV, IM, SQ every 68 hours), hydromorphone
(0.1 mg/kg SQ, IM, IV every 6-8 hours), fentanyl (3-10μg/kg per hour IV CR1); see
Precautions/Interactions.
Supplements
 Patients with CPV infections are frequently hypokalemic because of the Gl tract
losses, as well as hypoglycemic because of decreased storage abilities and lack of oral
food intake; potassium (maximum rate of0.5 mEq/kg per hour) and glucose (2.5-5%
added to intravenous fluids) often require supplementation.
Precautions/Interactions
■ One of the adverse effects of aminoglycosides is nephrotoxicity which could be
exacerbated by dehydration or hypovolemia. These agents should not be adminis-
  d      
therapy If these drugs are used, daily urine sediment examinations should be
performed to look for casts; therapy should be discontinued if casts are visualized.
■ Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in immature dogs because cartilage
abnormalities have been associated with their administration.
■ Phenothiazine derivative medications cause vasodilation and sedation, which may
 potentiate hypotension in animals with suboptimal perfusion and increase the chance
of aspiration of Gl contents in vomiting animals.
■ Sedation may also be a side effect of opioid medications.
■ Anticholinergic agents should not be administered because they may increase the
potential for intestinal ileus and intussusception.
■ Prokinetics, such a metoclopramide, are contraindicated in animals with high sus-
picion of Gl obstruction, as there could be an increased risk of Gl rupture.
Alternative Drugs
■ Oseltamivir has been advocated for use in CPV infection. Despite certain favorable
trends, it has not been shown to make a significant difference in management of
CPV.
■ FFP may be benehicial, as it provides immunoglobulins, as well as serum protease
suffering from coagulopathy due to DlC, FFP will provide coagulation factors as well
Diet
■ Oral intake should be discontinued in vomiting patients with CPV infection until
vomiting is significantly reduced to absent. To reinitiate oral intake, small amounts
of water should be offered and if tolerated, followed by frequent small meals of highly
digestible low fiber, low fat diet.
■ Early enteral nutrition has been advocated in CPV infections and is associated with
earlier clinical improvement and significant weight gain; this can be achieved by
placing a feeding tube, if a patient is anorexic. Trickle feeding small amounts of
enteral nutrition has been shown to decrease patient morbidity and mortality, even
in the face of vomiting.
Activity
■No activity restrictions are necessary during or after recovery from CPV infection.
■ The virus can be shed in the animal's feces for 14 to 30 days, so the animal and its
feces should be isolated from other animals during this potentially infective time
period.
Surgical Considerations
■ Patients with CPV infection who develop an intussusception require emergency
surgery; these patients may be at higher risk of developing perioperative complica-
tions due to their immunocompromised state. Fluid resuscitation is essential in
dehydrated and hypovolemic dogs prior to surgery.
CANINE PARVOVIRAL ENTERITIS129
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Other immature or poorly vaccinated dogs in the household are susceptible to CPV
infection; they should be evaluated by a veterinarian and vaccinated as soon as
possible.
■ The household, premises and any other objects that the affected animal has come
into contact with should be disinfected with l:30 dilution of bleach.
■ CPV is ubiquitous and can survive in the environment for 5 months or longer, there-
fore owners should avoid obtaining a new puppy for at least 6 months.
■ Convalescing animals typically shed large amounts of virus for up to 2 weeks after
resolution of infection and, therefore, should be isolated for that period of time.
 Even though immunity to CPV infection is long lasting and possibly lifelong. it is
imperative that the animal is vaccinated for other infectious diseases after recovery.
Patient Monitoring
 Frequent monitoring is essential to help guide therapeutic decisions. Physical param-
eters (i.e., temperature, mucous membrane color, CRT, heart rate, pulse quality
degree of abdominal pain) and blood pressure should be checked four to six times
daily, as indicated.
■ Packed red blood cell volume, total solids, and blood glucose should ideally be
monitored at least twice daily. Electrolytes, acid-base status, and weight should be
monitored at least once daily
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Attenuated live vaccine is the method of choice for prevention of CPV infection.
Vaccination should be initiated at 6 to 8 weeks of age and repeated every 2 to 3
weeks until 16 to 18 weeks of age. In high-risk breeds, evaluation of CPV titers may
 be useful in ensuring appropriate level of protection. Maternal antibody interference
 is considered the biggest cause of vaccine failure; use of high-titer vaccines minimizes
the chances of failure and is the current preferred vaccine.
Possible Complications
 Aspiration pneumonia due to vomiting: septic shock secondary to Gl bacterial trans
location and leukopenia; thromboembolism due to a hypercoagulable state, which
may be followed by hypocoagulability.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Average recovery time is 6 days.
            i
course of disease is good to excellent; poor without treatment; and poor to guarded
with outpatient care.

Cardiopulmonary Arrest
(CPA) and Cardiopulmonary
Cerebral Resuscitation (cPcR)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Cessation of effective perfusion and ventilation due to the absence of coordinated
cardiac and respiratory function. Cardiac arrest invariably follows respiratory arrest
if not recognized and corrected.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/ETIOLOGY
Generalized or cellular hypoxia may be the cause or effect of sudden death.
■After 1 to 4 minutes of airway obstruction, breathing efforts stop while circulation
remains intact.
 If obstruction continues for 6 to 9 minutes, severe hypotension and bradycardia lead
to dilated pupils, absence of heart sounds, and lack of palpable pulse.

Ventricular fibrillation, ventricular asystole, and PEA are rhythms indicating cessa-
tion of myocardial function.
Systems Affected

CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST (CPA) AND CARDIOPULMONARY CEREBRAL RESUSCITATION (CPCR)
133
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Sudden cardiovascular collapse associated with inadequate cardiac output can lead
to severe consequences
■ Quick assessment and diagnosis are critical.
■Assess the ABCs: airway, breathing, and circulation.
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
■ May be beneficial in identifying an underlying or contributing cause to CPA but
should not be part of initial triage of patient
Other Laboratory Tests
■ Blood gas evaluation may be useful during or after resuscitative procedures but again
  n  d  
■ Venous blood gas analysis may be more beneficial during resuscitation than arterial
blood gas
Imaging
 Thoracic radiographs may help identify underlying disease processes but should only
be considered when the patient has been stabilized.
 Echocardiography may confirm pericardial effusion or underlying myocardial disease
but should not interfere with resuscitative procedures.
Diagnostic Procedures
 Once CPA has developed continuous ECG monitoring, blood pressure monitoring.
pulse oximetry, and capnography may be useful in monitoring effectiveness of resus-
citative procedures
THERAPEUTICS
 CPCR should be instituted immediately upon diagnosing CPA. CPCR can be divided
into basic life support and advanced life support.
Basic Life Support
A: Airway
■ Assessment: The airway should be visualized by extending the patient's head and
neck and pulling the tongue forward. Any debris such as secretions, blood, or
vomitus should be cleared manually or with suction.
134
■Figure 18.1 Placement of a needle through the nasal philtrum to the level of the periosteum in an attempt
to stimulate spontaneous respiration.
■Establish: An airway should be established either via per oral endotracheal intubation
or if complete obstruction exists, emergency tracheotomy.
B: Breathing
■Assessment: Make sure animal is not breathing.
■ Institute artificial ventilation: Administer two short breaths approximately 2 seconds
duration each and reassess. If spontaneous respiration does not occur, continue
ventilations at a rate suitable for this animal (normal respiratory rate).Techniques
for ventilation include mouth to mouth, mouth to nose, or mouth to endotracheal
     d   d s  
Ambu bag and room air provides 2l percent oxygen.
 The preferred technique is endotracheal intubation and ventilation with 100 percent
oxygen using an Ambu bag or an anesthesia machine. The suggested rate of oxygen
administration is 150 ml/kg per minute.
■ The "Gen Chung" maneuver involves placement of a needle through the point of the
   s a n n d an  p  on d 
re-establishing spontaneous respiration (Figure 18.1).
C: Circulation
 Assessment: Palpate peripheral pulses and auscultate heart to confirm CPA.
 External cardiac massage has been shown to provide, at best, about 30 percent of
normal cardiac output. Internal cardiac massage has been shown to be two to three
times more effective in improving cerebral and coronary perfusion

 of the thorax. In this image, an assistant is also performing interposed abdominal compressions to help push
blood back into the thoracic vena cava and the right-sided heart during the time when the thorax is not
compressed.
 Hemodynamic studies in animal models suggest that several different mechanisms
          
During external cardiac massage the cardiac pump theory takes advantage of direct
kilograms, the thoracic pump theory is utilized. This technique utilizes increases in
intrathoracic pressures to increase cardiac output via the major arteries.
Compression/Ventilation Techniques
 Chest compressions should be performed rapidly at a rate of between 80 and 100
compressions per minute. The chest should be displaced approximately 30 percent.
]
 Recent information suggests that compressions performed to the music “Staying
Alive” provides a compression rate of approximately 100 compressions per minute
  In animals less than 7-kg body weight, the cardiac pump mechanism should be uti
d  ss    n    
directly over the heart (intercostal spaces 3-5). This can be done using one hand or
two hands.
■ In animals larger than 7-kg body weight, the thoracic pump mechanism should be
utilized. With the animal in right lateral, thoracic compressions are applied at the
widest portion of the thorax (Figure 18.2).
■ If using asynchronous ventilation and compression, one breath is given following
every five compressions.
 If using synchronous ventilation and compression, one breath is given simultane
ously with every fourth to fifth compression.

Figure 18.3 The heart within the pericardial sac during open-chest cardiopulmonary chest resuscitation
Visualize the phrenic nerve over the dorsal portion of the pericardium and avoid damage to the phrenic nerve
by incising the pericardium at the apex of the heart, then ripping the pericardium with your fingers until the
heart can be extracted from the pericardial sac for direct cardiac compressions.
■  Interposed  abdominal compressions between  chest compressions  have  been
shown to enhance cerebral and coronary blood flow by increasing aortic diastolic
pressure.
Open-Chest Cardiopulmonary Cerebral Resuscitation
■  Indicated if closed chest CPCR is ineffective or pre-existing conditions such as flail
chest, obesity, diaphragmatic hernia, pericardial effusion, and so on preclude effec-
tive closed chest techniques
■ Performed through a left thoracotomy at the fifth or sixth intercostal space (Figure
18.3)
■ A pericardectomy should be performed.
■
The palmar surface of the fingers and thumb are use to milk the ventricular blood
toward the great vessels. Digital compression of the descending aorta may help
cranial perfusion.
Advanced Life Support
D:Drugs
■Drug selection is based on the arrhythmia that is present.
■ Atropine and epinephrine are most often correct selections.
CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST (CPA) AND CARDIOPULMONARY CEREBRAL RESUSCITATION (CPCR)
137
E: Electrocardiogram
Accurate ECG interpretation is imperative.
 Try to minimize cessation of thoracic compressions when evaluating ECG.
F: Fibrillation Controls and Fluids
■ Defibrillation is time dependent and must be performed immediately.
■Fluids should be administered cautiously.
Aggressive volume resuscitation should not be used unless hypovolemia was thought
to be a contributing factor in CPA.
■ Volume overload can lead to decreased coronary artery perfusion, therefore, intra-
venous fluids are contraindicated unless relative (i.e., sepsis or anesthetic gases) or
absolute (i.e., hemorrhage, severe volume loss due to vomiting, diarrhea, or wound
exudates) hypovolemia is present.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ The selection of drugs is based on the arrhythmia present.
■Epinephrine: 0.0l mg/kg IV repeated every 3 to 5 minutes.
■
 Atropine: 0.05 mg/kg IV repeated every 3 to 5 minutes for maximum of three doses
Vasopressin: 0.8U/kg IV; may be used in refractory cases.
■]
Drugs should be administered via central vein, intratracheal, intraosseous, or periph-
double the calculated volume to be delivered. Sodium bicarbonate should never be
administered into the trachea.
■ Intracardiac drug administration should be used as a last resort only, unless open
chest CPCR is being performed and drugs can be administered directly into the left
ventricle. Blind thoracocentesis in an attempt to perform an intracardiac injection is
contraindicated, as injection directly into the myocardium or damage to the coronary
arteries can occur.
COMMENTS
Miscellaneous
Comparative Cardiopulmonary Cerebral Resuscitation
Current recommendations of the American Heart Association include defibrillation
as a component of basic life support. This has not been extrapolated to veterinary
patients. The most common rhythm associated with cardiac arrest in humans is
ventricular fibrillation, whereas the most common rhythm in veterinary patients that
leads to cardiac arrest is PEA.
138
Patient Monitoring
■ Maintain heart rate and blood pressure with fluids and inotropic agents.
 Monitor arterial blood pressure.
 Monitor central venous pressure.
■
Blood gas analysis.
■ Support respiration with artificial ventilation and supplemental oxygen.
■ Continued neurological assessment. If signs of increased intracranial pressure, con-
sider mannitol and furosemide
■ Continued monitoring of ECG
■Monitor urine output.
■Monitor body temperature.
■ Radiograph thorax to assess resuscitative injury such as rib fractures or pulmonary
contusions. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can occur secondary to airway
obstruction.

Chocolate Toxicity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■  Ingestion of chocolate (methylxanthine alkaloids) in sufficient quantity to cause
gastrointestinal, neurologic, and cardiac abnormalities
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Methylxanthine alkaloids-theobromine and caffeine from the cocoa bean
 Methylxanthines-adenosine receptor antagonist in the CNS; causing stimulation and
cerebral vasoconstriction; direct myocardial stimulator—tachycardia; increased
calcium entry into the sarcoplasmic reticulum—increased skeletal and myocardial
contractility
■ Caffeine—phosphodiesterase inhibitor; increased cAMP and the release of
catecholamines
 Theobrominine—undergoes enterohepatic recirculation (Table 19.1)
■ Theobromine and caffeine LD50 = 100 to 200 mg/kg, however, clinical signs can be
seen as low as 20 mg/kg (Table 19.2)

Chylothorax
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■
The accumulation of chyle in the pleural space
 Chyle—fluid that is absorbed by lacteals from the intestines. It is composed of mainly
lymph and triglycerides.
Thoracic lymphangiectasia—dilated lymphatics. Occurs in many animals with
chylothorax.
Fibrosing pleuritis—condition that can be caused by chronic irritation of the pleurae
from chyle. It results in inflammation and thickening of the pleurae, which causes
decreased ventilatory capacity.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Chyle flows from lymphatics in the mesentery to the cisterna chyli in the abdomen.
which then continues in the thorax as the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct empties
into the venous system.
■ In most cases of chylothorax, abnormal flow or pressures in the thoracic duct are
thought to result in the exudation of chyle from dilated thoracic lymphatic vessels
into the pleural space.
■ Lymphangiectasia is believed to result from either increased lymphatic flow (due
to increased lymph formation), decreased lymphatic drainage (due to high venous
 pressures), or the simultaneous occurrence of both processes.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Differentiating Causes
 Any cause of respiratory distress or coughing
 Differential diagnoses for exudative pleural effusion include pyothorax, effusion from
FIP, neoplastic effusion, pseudochylous effusion, and chylous effusion.
 Pseudochylous effusion is effusion that has a milky appearance due to a high cellular
ity, but has a low triglyceride level and a high cholesterol level compared to serum.
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Chemistry/Urinalysis
■ Often normal
■  May find lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia
Other Laboratory Tests
 Pleural Fluid Analysis
■Characteristicsmilky and opaque, usually white in color but can range from yellow
to pink; may not appear milky in animals with long-term inappetance/anorexia
(Figure 20.1)
■ Protein content—inaccurate measurement on refractometer due to high lipid content
■ Total nucleated count—usually less than 10,000 cells/μul
Fluid Cytology
 Mostly small lymphocytes or neutrophils
■ Nondegenerative neutrophils may be predominate cell type with chronic chylothorax
due to prolonged loss of lymphocytes or when multiple thoracocenteses result in
inflammation.
■If abnormal lymphocytes are present, there may be underlying neoplasia.

Imaging
Thoracic Radiography (Figure 20.2)
■  Repeat thoracic radiographs after thoracocentesis is performed to remove most of
pleural fluid.
■ If atelectatic or consolidated lung lobes are noted after pleural fluid is removed,
underlying pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g., lung lobe torsion, pneumonia,
neoplasia) or pleural disease (e.g., fibrosing pleuritis) should be suspected.
Ultrasonography
■ Should be performed before removing fluid if possible as fluid can enhance visualiza-
tion of thoracic structures
■ Used to detect underlying cardiac disease, pericardial disease, and mediastinal
masses

mass. Note the widening of the mediastinum cranial to the cardiac silhouette.
Diagnostic Procedures
Thoracocentesis allows characterization of fluid.
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Rutin: 50 to 100 mg/kg PO every 8 hours.
■ One study shows complete resolution of chylous effusion within 2 months of
therapy in at least 25 percent of patients. Since chylothorax resolves spontaneously
in some animals, more studies need to be performed to see what percentage of
chylothorax cases would have resolved without any treatment.
Contraindications
■Severe fibrosing pleuritis is associated with a grave prognosis, medical or surgical treat-
ment is unlikely to be beneficial. This occurs more commonly in cats than in dogs.
Medical Management
■  Immediate thoracocentesis for patients with respiratory difficulty and suspected
pleural effusion
■  Treat underlying cause if possible.
■ Medical management with intermittent thoracocentesis when respiratory difficulty
is noted
■ Perform thoracocentesis under aseptic conditions to reduce risk of iatrogenic
infection.
■ Chest tubes only in patients with chylothorax due to trauma (rare), patients with
rapid fluid accumulation, or postoperative patients
■Rutin
■ Low fat diet; may decrease fat content in pleural effusion, which may improve fluid
reabsorption from thoracic cavity and decrease chyle accumulation
■ Some cases of chylothorax may resolve spontaneously in several weeks or months.
■ Most cases of chylothorax due to traumatic rupture of the thoracic duct resolve
without surgery within a few weeks.
Surgical Management
■ Recommended in patients who do not respond to medical management after 2 to 3
months
■Thoracic duct ligation
 The theory is that after the thoracic duct is ligated, abdominal lymphaticovenous
thoracic duct.
■ Thoracic duct has multiple branches in the caudal thorax, all of these branches
need to be occluded. A mesenteric lymphatic should be catheterized for lymphan-
giography—facilitates visualization and complete occlusion of all branches of
thoracic duct.
■ High incidence of continued or recurrent chylous or nonchylous effusion
post-operatively
d p    
■ Thoracic duct ligation alone may fail due to thickening of pericardium from
chronic irritation by chyle resulting in increased right-sided venous pressures.
cations. A pericardectomy may help reduce the occurrence of this
■ Success rates variable, but reported to be as high as lo0 percent
■ Thoracic duct ligation and cisterna chyli ablation
Thoracic duct ligation alone may lead to caudal thoracic duct and cisterna chyli
hypertension, which could be a stimulus for development of collateral lymphatics
that causes recurrence of chylothorax after thoracic duct ligation.
 Cisterna chyli ablation may force disrupted lymphatic channels to form new drain-
age connections within the abdominal cavity
■ This procedure resulted in resolution of chylous pleural effusion in 88 percent of
dogs in one study.
 Thoracic duct ligation, cistern chyli ablation, and pericardectomy
■Recommended by some surgeons
CHYLOTHORAX
153
Other
 If medical management and surgical management fail, there are palliative options to
drain the pleural space.
 Placement of subcutaneous vascular access port connected to an intrathoracic
drain allows for chronic chest drainage through a subcutaneous injection
port.
■Historically, other devices and procedures have been tried for palliative treatment
of chylothorax, including pleuroperitoneal shunts, pleurovenous shunts, and
pleurodesis. These options are no longer commonly practiced.
COMMENTS
Miscellaneous
  Diffuse lymphatic abnormalities (i.e., intestinal lymphangiectasia, hepatic lymphan-
giectasia, pulmonary lymphangiectasia, and chylous ascites) may be present. These
findings may be associated with a worse prognosis.
 Young patients with chylothorax may have a better prognosis than older animals due
to increased incidence of neoplasia in older patients.
Patient Monitoring
 Monitor closely for respiratory difficulty—-thoracocentesis as needed
to detect recurrence
Possible Complications
■ Fibrosing pleuritis—most common serious complication of chronic chylothorax
■  Immunosuppression—may develop in patients undergoing repeated and frequent
thoracocentesis due to lymphocyte depletion
■ Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in dogs undergoing multiple thoracocentesis
Expected Course and Prognosis
■May resolve spontaneously or after surgery
 Chronic disease may result in severe fibrosing pleuritis and persistent respiratory
difficulty.
■ Euthanasia frequently performed in patients that do not respond to therapy

Coonhound Paralysis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Acute inflammation of multiple nerve roots and peripheral nerves in dogs, with or
without a previous history of contact with a raccoon.
 Proposed animal model for GBS in humans.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Largely unknown, although coonhound paralysis is closely linked with raccoon
contact, specifically with raccoon saliva.
 Suspected immune-mediated disease for both coonhound paralysis and ACIP.
■ ACIP has been suspected to be associated with previous vaccination and possibly
respiratory or gastrointestinal viral or bacterial infections.
 Most commonly recognized polyneuropathy in dogs in North America, although the
incidence is low.
 The distribution of coonhound paralysis is relative to the distribution of raccoons
(North and Central America, as well as parts of South America).
■ ACIP is found worldwide.
Systems Affected
1  Nervous—the peripheral nervous system with the most severe involvement being in
the ventral nerve roots and ventral root components of the spinal nerves.
■ Cranial nerves are affected in some patients, with the most commonly affected nerves
being Vll and X.
 Respiratory paralysis may occur in severe cases, secondary to intercostal and phrenic
nerve involvement.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ In coonhound paralysis, there is a predilection for coonhounds and other raccoon
hunting breeds, but any breed in contact with raccoons is susceptible.
155
■ Previous disease does not confer immunity and may actually increase the risk of
disease recurrence.
■ Multiple bouts of coonhound paralysis are not uncommon in the same dog.
■ There are no breed predilections with ACIP.
Historical Findings
P      n   t    s s 
antecedent precipitating events (i.e., vaccinations).
■Owners initially note a stiff-stilted gait in all four limbs.
There is a rapid progression to a flaccid lower motor neuron tetraparesis to
tetraplegia.
■ Appetite and water consumption usually remain normal, although dogs may not be
able to voluntarily reach food or water.
■ Urination and defecation also are usually reported as being normal.
■  Initial progression of disease usually occurs over 4 to 5 days, although occasionally
progression can occur up to l0 days.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Neurologic Examination Findings
■ Usually neurological signs are symmetrical.
There is a generalized hyporeflexia to areflexia, hypotonia to atonia, and severe neu-
rogenic muscle atrophy (more chronic change).
 Pelvic limbs are usually more severely affected than the thoracic limbs.
■
 Respiration may be labored in severely affected dogs with occasional progression to
respiratory paralysis.
Aphonia or dysphonia is common.
■ Facial paresis, if present, will be bilateral with incomplete palpebral closure in many
patients.
■ Pain sensation is intact, although many dogs initially demonstrate a hyperesthesia
because of variable dorsal nerve root inflammatory involvement.
■Motor dysfunction always predominates.
■Tail wag is invariably intact.

COONHOUND PARALYSIS
157
Fulminant myasthenia gravis
 Generalized (diffuse) or multifocal myelopathy (involving both cervical and lumbo-
sacral intumescences)
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Serum immunoglobulin analysis reveals a high serum IgG but not IgM in some
patients.
 There is a serum reaction to raccoon saliva on ELISA. Dogs with coonhound paralysis
have a strong positive reaction that decreases in intensity over time. Dogs without
clinical disease but with recent raccoon contact also have a strong positive reaction.
Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis
■ Lumbar CSF analysis will reveal a high protein without an increase in leukocytes at
all stages of disease.
Cerebellomedullary CSF will only reveal a mildly elevated protein in severely affected
patients in the acute stages of disease.
 CSF protein elevation is due to albumin leakage across a disrupted blood-brain and
blood-nerve barrier.
Electrodiagnostics
■ Generalized spontaneous activity is seen on EMG, the severity of which depends on
the time of examination after disease onset and the severity of neurologic signs.
■
 There will be markedly low compound muscle action potential amplitudes affer
motor nerve stimulation
■ Motor nerve root studies (F waves) will reveal an increased minimum latency.
 Motor nerve conduction velocities may be within normal range in mildly to
moderately affected dogs. whereas severely affected patients may have mildly low
values.
■ Sensory nerve function is usually normal.
Pathologic Findings
■ Ventral nerve roots and the ventral root components of the spinal nerves develop
the most severe lesions, consisting of various degrees of axonal degeneration,
paranodal and segmental demyelination, and leukocyte infiltration (predominantly
monocytes and macrophages, with scattered groups of lymphocytes and plasma
cells).
■Peripheral motor and mixed nerves are similarly affected, although to a lesser degree
■  Dorsal nerve roots are much less severely affected.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Patients should be closely monitored in the progressive stage of the disease (espe-
cially during the first 4 days) for respiratory problems.
■If severe respiratory compromise develops, intensive care and ventilatory support
may be required.
■  Intravenous fluid therapy would only be necessary if the patient is dehydrated due
to an inability to reach water.
■Excellent nursing care is essential.
■ Patients are able to eat and drink if they can reach food and water but often must
be hand fed because of difficulty in moving their limbs and raising their head and
neck.
■  Intensive physiotherapy is important to decrease muscle atrophy.
Frequent turning and excellent padding are essential to prevent pressure sores.
■ Encourage the patient to try to move as much as possible.
Drug(s) of choice
■None have been proven in dogs to be effective in improving clinical signs or shorten-
ing the course of disease.
■ Immunoglobulins at 1 g/kg IV daily for 2 consecutive days or 0.4 g/kg IV daily for 4
to 5 consecutive days; given early has been shown to decrease the severity or shorten
recovery time of GBS in humans.
■ Immunoglobulin therapy is very expensive, although it could be equally as valuable
in dogs.
■ Corticosteroids are contraindicated. They do not improve clinical signs or
shorten the course of disease. They have been shown to reduce survival in humans
with GBS.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Inform the client that good nursing care is essential.
■ Discuss the importance of preventing pressure sores and urine scalding and of limit-
ing the degree of muscle atrophy by diligent physiotherapy (e.g.. passive limb move-
ment, massage, electrical stimulation, and swimming as the patient's strength begins
to improve).
■ Inform the client that the patient needs soft, resilient bedding (straw or fleeces are
excellent) that must be kept clean and free of urine and feces.
 u e  q s (u t a n n 
are important.
COONHOUND PARALYSIS
159
Patient Monitoring
■It is important to keep in close contact with the client regarding complications or
changes in the patient's condition.
■ Perform urinalyses periodically to check for cystitis in tetraplegic or severely tetra-
paretic patients.
■Ideally, reevaluate the patient at least every 2 to 3 weeks initially.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ In dogs with coonhound paralysis, the best prevention for future episodes is to avoid
further contact with raccoons. This is often not feasible because of the dog's environ-
ment and primary use as raccoon hunters.
 Because raccoons are very common in suburban areas across the country, avoiding
contact between household dogs and raccoons also can be challenging.
Possible Complications
 Respiratory paralysis in the progressive stage of the disease.
 Pressure sores, urine scalding, and cystitis are common in chronically recumbent
dogs.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Most affected dogs recover fully.
■Mild residual neurologic deficits may remain.
■The disease duration is usually several weeks (6-8) in mildly to moderately affected
dogs.
Severely affected dogs can show signs for 3 to 4 months
■ The order of improvement in signs usually follows the order of initial dysfunction.

Diaphragmatic Hernia
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A DH is disruption of the diaphragm that results in the displacement of abdominal
viscera into the thoracic cavity.
1A pleuroperitoneal DH involves displacement of abdominal viscera into the pleural
cavity and is typically acquired due to trauma but may rarely be congenital.
 A peritoneopericardial DH is typically congenital and occurs due to failure of the
diaphragm to fuse separately from the pericardial sac and results in the displacement
of abdominal viscera into the pericardial space.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Traumatic DHs result from an excessive pressure differential between the abdominal
and thoracic cavities.
■ When the abdomen is compressed due to trauma (i.e., automobile accident, fall from
height), there is increased intra-abdominal pressure that is transmitted across the
diaphragm to the thoracic cavity.
If the glottis is open, the air within the lungs is allowed to escape to allow decreased
intrathoracic pressure. The pressure differential allows the diaphragm to tear, creat-
ing the hernia.
■ With traumatic DH many factors may contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular
compromise.
 Loss of diaphragmatic continuity results in loss of negative pressure, which impairs
lung expansion.
 Trauma to the chest wall (i.e., rib fractures, flail segment) results in decreased chest
wall excursion due to pain and mechanical factors.
■ Fluid or air accumulation and organ entrapment within the thorax result in lung
compression and hypoventilation.
 pas pe usuxa un l ng  suosn d
permeability due to ongoing inflammation can result in pulmonary edema. Pulmonary
contusions result in diffusion impairment and hypoxemia.
■ Myocardial contusions may result in cardiac dysrhythmias and decreased cardiac
output.
161
■ Hypovolemia due to blood loss may lead to decreased tissue perfusion and multiple
organ failure.
Systems Affected
■Cardiovascular—Myocardial contusions may occur due to trauma and cause cardiac
dysrhythmias. Dysrhythmias usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of the trauma
and will typically resolve within approximately 5 days. Ventricular dysrhythmias are
most common; but other dysrhythmias may also occur. Cardiac output may also be
decreased due to hypovolemic shock if hemorrhage has occurred.
■ Gastrointestinal—The stomach and intestines are commonly displaced into the tho-
racic cavity with both congenital or traumatic DH; gastrointestinal displacement in
the thorax can cause vomiting. inappetence, and weight loss. Gas distension of the
stomach and intestines can occur and compromise lung expansion. If the tear or rent
in the diaphragm is small, the intestines can become devitalized due to strangulation,
volvulus, or entrapment.
■ Hepatobiliary—The liver may be displaced into the thorax and its blood circulation
or biliary flow can be disrupted.
■ Musculoskeletal—Trauma to the chest wall may occur and cause decreased chest
wall excursion. Other orthopedic injuries may occur secondary to trauma.
■  Respiratory—Respiratory compromise occurs due to loss of negative thoracic pres-
sure, trauma to the chest wall, fluid or air accumulation within the thoracic cavity
pulmonary contusions, and secondary pulmonary edema.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Congenital—Breed predilection for Weimaraners and cocker spaniel dogs and
Himalayan and Persian cats.
■ Congenital DHs may be present at birth but may not become clinically apparent
for several years.
■  Traumatic—No breed predilection.
■ More common in younger and male animals due to higher potential for roaming.
Risk Factors/Causes
■Free roaming increases risk for trauma.
Historical Findings
■ Respiratory distress/orthopnea
 Exercise intolerance
■ Tucked up abdomen
■Vomiting
■Difficulty lying down

CLINICAL FEATURES
■May be an incidental finding on thoracic radiographs

 Respiratory dificulty/orthopnea
■
 Muffled heart and lung sounds; intestinal sounds or borborygmi may be ausculted

 Cardiac dysrhythmias may occur secondary to myocardial contusions or shock.
Signs of hypovolemic shock—pale mucous membranes, weak, thready pulses, cool
peripheral extremities, hypothermia, or hypotension
■Abdomen palpably “empty"
■]
 Icterus may be noted with chronic hepatic entrapment.
Congenital DH may coexist with other congenital defects including umbilical and
supraumbilical hernias, sternal malformations, and cardiac defects.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Pulmonary contusions, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmo.
nary thromboembolism, thoracic neoplasia, and lung lobe torsion
With peritoneal pericardial DH, pericardial effusion, or cardiomegaly due to cardiac
disease
DIAGNOSTICS
 Thoracic radiographs—Loss of continuity of diaphragm, soft tissue opacities or gas-
filled intestinal loops within thoracic cavity (Figures 22.1 and 22.2). Pleural effusion,
pulmonary contusions, and rib fractures may also be seen. Plain radiographs will
diagnose approximately 66 percent of hernias.
 If pleural effusion obscures the diaphragm, performing thoracocentesis and then
repeating radiographs may be helpful in making a diagnosis.
With peritoneal pericardial DH, an enlarged cardiac silhouette, dorsal displacement
of the trachea, and gas patterns overlying the cardiac silhouette may be seen as well
as loss of diaphragmatic continuity.
Positive contrast peritoneography:
■ Can be performed if plain radiographs not diagnostic.

phragmatic outline is not visible ventrally. Note the soft tissue opacity within the thoracic cavity and the cranial

■ Inject 1.l ml/kg of water-soluble iodinated contrast solution into the abdomen
repeat radiographs.
■  Contrast material within the thoracic cavity, absence of normal liver lobe outline
within the abdomen or incomplete visualization of the abdominal surface of the
diaphragm are considered diagnostic for DH.
DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA165
1Negative contrast peritoneography:
in this position, take a ventrodorsal radiograph using horizontal beam
technique.
■ Air normally accumulates between the liver and the diaphragm; with DH, air will
accumulate at the thoracic inlet.
■Upper GI barium study—Can allow visualization of stomach or intestines within the
thoracic cavity but there is potential for aspiration of barium into the lungs and
false-negatives can occur if the herniated viscera does not include any portion of the
upper Gl tract.
■ Ultrasonography—Evaluate for continuity of the diaphragm and for abdominal
viscera within the thorax.
Pathological Findings
 Diaphragmatic rent
■Abdominal viscera displaced into thorax
■ Compromise to blood supply may result in nonviable tissue.
■ Gas distension of the stomach or intestines may be noted.
Adhesions if DH is chronic
 Thoracic fluid may be noted (i.e., blood, serosanguineous fluid, or chyle).
 Pulmonary contusions or edema and lung atelectasis may be present.
THERAPEUTICS
 Patient stabilization—Administer oxygen, intravenous fluids, analgesia, and antiar-
rhythmics if indicated. With gas distension of the stomach within the thorax, emer-
gency decompression should be performed by passing an orogastric or nasogastric
tube or by percutaneous trocharization or passage of a needle through the chest wall
into the stomach.
Surgical repair of the hernia once the patient is stable—Use a balanced anesthetic
protocol that consists of a premedication, induction drug(s), and inhalant or inject-
able anesthetic drugs. Premedicate patient to reduce anxiety and to decrease the
0.5mg/kg IV with propofol 2-4mg/kg IV, etomidate 1-2mg/kg IV; or fentanyl
10μg/kg IV with 0.5mg/kg diazepam) and intubation. Control positive pressure
ventilation once the patient is intubated. Administer perioperative antibiotics.
Clip and aseptically scrub both the ventral abdomen and the lateral and ventral
thorax in the event that the incision needs to be extended cranially The surgical
approach should be through a ventral midline abdominal incision. Inspect the
herniated abdominal contents for viability and gently replace them into the
abdomen. If necessary, enlarge the diaphragmatic defect to allow this. Gently break
down any adhesions, then resect and remove any devitalized tissue. Close the

diaphragmatic rent using absorbable or nonabsorbable monofilament suture working
from the least accessible portion of the rent toward the surgeon (Figure 22.3).
 Restore negative intrathoracic pressure by placing a thoracostomy tube or by percu-
taneous or transdiaphragmatic thoracocentesis. Close the abdomen in a routine
manner.
■ Postoperatively, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluid therapy and analgesia
should be administered. If a continued pneumothorax is present, continuous nega-
tive suction of thoracostomy tube may be required. Postoperative monitoring should
include pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis, electrolytes, glucose, packed
cell volume, total protein, ECG, and blood pressure. Urine output should be moni-
tored if there is concurrent urinary tract trauma.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Nitrous oxide is contraindicated with anesthesia for DH because it diffuses into the
chest cavity, reexpands the gas space within the pleural cavity, and inhibits lung
expansion.
 Chamber/mask induction is not recommended due to length of time and depth of
anesthesia required before intubation and positive pressure ventilation can be
initiated.
DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA
167
Activity
■ Limited preoperatively due to respiratory compromise, limited for 2 weeks postop-
eratively to allow healing
Surgical Considerations
  In the past, delaying surgery for at least 24 hours was recommended to reduce mor-
tality, but recent studies indicate no difference in mortality with early versus delayed
surgical intervention. However, the cardiovascular system should ideally be stabi-
lized prior to anesthesia and surgery.
Animals with gastric herniation, evidence of visceral or vascular compromise, or with
severe respiratory compromise associated with herniation of abdominal contents
should undergo surgery as soon as possible.
Congenital DHs should be repaired as soon as possible to avoid adhesion formation
Atelectatic lung should not be rapidly reinflanted as this may contribute to re-
expansion pulmonary edema.
Strangulated viscera should be resected without allowing reestablishment of normal
circulation to avoid release of oxygen radicals and bacterial toxins into the general
circulation.

■ Pleural effusion, hepatomegaly, ascites
Diagnostic Procedures
■ Percutaneous endomyocardial biopsy with histopathology. quantitative myocardial
carnitine assay
■  Serum taurine levels should be evaluated in atypical breeds.
Gross and Histopathologic Findings
■Dilation and thinning of all chambers
Slightly thickened endocardium with pale areas within the myocardium (i.e., necro-
sis, fibrosis)
 Histopathologic (light) changes are minimal: small areas of myocyte atrophy, myo-
cytolysis, myocardial necrosis, and fibrosis
THERAPEUTICS
■ With the exception of severely affected dogs, most therapy can be administered on
an outpatient basis
Drug(s) of choice
■ First identify and address most pressing patient problems: CHF (left- or right-sided),
arrhythmia, hypothermia, renal failure, or markedly reduced forward cardiac output
(shock).
Initial Stabilization
(warm environment).
■ Administration of intravenous or subcutaneous fluids (D,W or 0.45% NaCl with
2.5% dextrose) should be avoided, given only after pulmonary edema is controlled
 or pleural effusion has been aspirated.
■ If there is pulmonary edema: furosemide (1-4 mg/kg IV every 20-40 minutes until
respiratory rate is reduced by 25-50 percent then 1-2 mg/kg two to three times a day
for the first 2-3 days)
■Pimobendan 0.25 to 0.3 mg/kg PO twice a day has been proven to increase survival
and provide rapid (2-6 hours) hemodynamic benefit.
■ If there is significant pleural effusion, drain each hemithorax with an 18- to 20-gauge
butterfly catheter.
DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY (DCM)175
  If there is severe heart failure and cardiogenic shock, pimobendan and dobutamine
may both be used. This combination may predispose to clinically important arrhyth-
mias particularly in the hypoxic dog.
■ Digoxin—oral therapy
n ym so z on t ng pasn anu nad yi ot on sauqo 
 If paroxysmal or sustained ventricular tachycardia is present administer lidocaine
slowly in 2 mg/kg boluses (up to 8mg/kg total) to convert to sinus rhythm. Follow
with lidocaine infusion (5-100 μg/kg per minute).
■ If lidocaine is ineffective administer procainamide slowly in 2mg/kg intravenous
boluses (up to 20mg/kg total) to convert to sinus rhythm. Follow with a 20 to
50μg/kg per minute infusion or 8 to 20 mg/kg IM four times a day.
Maintenance Therapy
1 Triple therapy (ACE inhibitors, pimobendan, and diuretics) is considered by most
to represent the standard of care for DCM
Enalapril (0.25-0.5 mg/kg PO twice a day) or Benazepril (0.25-0.5 mg/kg PO every
24 hours) should be initiated within the first few days in the therapeutic regimen.
■ Furosemide 0.5 to 2 mg/kg once to three times a day is used to control pulmonary
edema, pleural effusion, or ascites.
■The addition of spironolactone to standard triple therapy has been shown to confer
independent survival benefit.
■A daily maintenance dose of 0.375 to 0.75mg of digoxin (divided twice a day) is
used by many.
■Do not exceed 0.015 mg/kg per day and do not exceed 0.375 mg per day in Doberman
pinschers.
■Digoxin is used only as adjunctive therapy for AF
Arrhythmias
■  In the case of AF, slowing of the ventricular rate response is achieved with chronic
administration of atenolol (0.75-l.5 mg/kg PO twice a day) or diltiazem (Dilaco1
3-7 mg/kg PO twice a day) combined sometimes with digitalis.
■ The therapeutic goal is obtaining a resting ventricular rate between 100 and 140
beats per minute.
■ This therapy merely controls the ventricular rate, by depressing AV nodal conduc-
tion; it generally does not convert the rhythm from AF to sinus rhythm
■ Recent studies have suggested that amiodarone may result in conversion of AF to
normal sinus rhythm in a small subset of patients
■Chronic oral therapy for VT includes sotalol 1-2 mg/kg PO every 12 hours or mexi-
letine (5-8mg/kg PO three times a day)
■ These drugs can be combined with a β-blocker if necessary.
■ The role of carnitine and taurine in the therapy of DCM is controversial.
Contraindications
■Digoxin should be avoided in severe uncontrolled PVT.
176 BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Precautions/Interactions
■ β-blockers and calcium channel blockers are negative inotropes and may adversely
affect myocardial function.
■ β-blockers should never be given to a patient when signs of congestion are present.
■ The combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors my result in azotemia, especially
in patients with severe reductions in forward cardiac output or pre-existent renal
dysfunction.
■ Renal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, and hypokalemia predispose to digitalis
intoxication.
Alternative Drugs
■If ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, other vasodilators, including amlodipine, may be
used instead.
■  The role of β-blockers for cardioprotection is an active area of research but definitive
benefit has not yet been established.
■ The role of CoQ-l0 and fish-oil supplementation is yet to be defined but may be of
benefit.
■ Caution must be used when homeopathic supplements are given because they com-
monly contain components with diuretic or digitalis-like properties.
Diet
■ Ideally reduce dietary Na* below 12 to 15 mg/kg per day but do not manipulate diet
until signs of CHF and reduced cardiac output are addressed.
■ Severe Nat restriction is not necessary when using hemodynamically potent drugs.
■ Best to use commercially prepared diets
Activity
■Allow the dog to choose its own level of activity.
Surgical Considerations
 devices have been discussed; information regarding surgical success and long-term
follow-up is as yet unavailable.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Emphasize potential signs associated with progression of disease (i.e., decreased
activity, collapse, and increased respiratory rate and effort) and adverse side effects
of medications (i.e., weakness, anorexia, and lethargy)
DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY (DCM)
177
Patient Monitoring
■ Serial clinical examinations, thoracic radiographs, blood pressure measurements,
routine biochemical screens, and ECG are most helpful.
 Repeat echocardiography is rarely informative.
 Serial evaluation of serum digoxin levels (therapeutic range of 0.6-l.0ng/ml) and
serum biochemistries may help prevent iatrogenic problems.
Possible Complications
Sudden death (arrhythmia)
■  Iatrogenic problems associated with medical management
Expected Course and Prognosis
■Always fatal
 Six to 24 months following diagnosis
■ Dobermans typically have a worse prognosis (<6 month median survival).
■ AF, PVT, and markedly decreased FS% are probably markers for short survival and
sudden death.
Age-Related Factors
■Prevalence increases with age.

Disorders of Chloride
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Disorders of chloride include hyperchloridemia and hypochloridemia.
 Derangements of chloride can result in acid-base disturbances and alterations in free
water balance.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Chloride ions account for roughly two-thirds of the anions within the extracellular
fluid, including plasma.
■ Chloride is the major anion that is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed by the
renal tubules.
■ The chloride ion concentration within cells is much lower than the plasma concen-
tration. The intracellular concentration varies in different types of cells and is depen-
dent on the resting-membrane potential of the cell.
■ For example, the intracellular concentration of chloride in red blood cells is, on
average, 60 mEq/L, whereas the intracellular concentration of chloride in muscle
cells is only 2 to 4 mEq/L. The higher intracellular concentration of chloride within
the red blood cells allows for the effective movement of chloride in and out of the
red blood. This ready movement of chloride is the basis for the "chloride shift."
■ Chloride is the most prevalent anion found in gastric fluid as well as small and large
intestinal fluid.
■ Chloride ions are both reabsorbed and secreted in the gastrointestinal tract. The
colon is extremely efficient at chloride reabsorption.
■ Chloride is the second most prevalent ion found in the glomerular ultrafiltrate.
■ Fifty to 60 percent of the filtered load of chloride is reabsorbed by the proximal
tubule of the nephron.
 Chloride reabsorption also occurs in the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle.
Loop diuretics such as furosemide act in the Loop of Henle by competing for the
chloride site of the Na+-K+-2Cl carrier.
 Metabolic acidosis is classically divided into hyperchloremic and normochloremic
disturbances based upon the anion gap and the chloride concentration.
■ The anion gap represents the difference between measured cations (sodium and
potassium) and measured anions (chloride and bicarbonate). Physiologically
179
180
electroneutrality must be maintained so the anion gap represents a clinically useful
oversimplification.
■ Metabolic acidosis is seen when there is an increase in the concentration of
"strong" anions. A strong anion is one which dissociates completely at body pH.
Examples include chloride, lactate, and the ketoanions.
■ When chloride concentration is increased the sum of the measured anions is
unchanged, hence a hyperchloremic or normal anion gap acidosis.
■ If the strong anion, which is increased, is unmeasured then the chloride concen-
tration remains normal and the bicarbonate concentration decreases. The sum of
the measured anions decreases resulting in a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.
■ In metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory acidosis there is an increase in ammo-
 nium chloride excretion. It is common to see hypochloremia in chronic respiratory
acidosis.
■ The roles of hypochloremia and volume depletion in metabolic alkalosis are topics
of debate. There is no debate however, that when lost fluid (i.e., vomitus) contains
an excess of chloride relative to bicarbonate, a metabolic alkalosis will occur.
■ Hyperchloremia is seen with chronic respiratory alkalosis to decrease renal ammo-
nium chloride excretion and increase chloride reabsorption
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Hypochloremia has been documented in racing greyhounds
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Clinical signs are related to underlying disease and acid-base abnormalities.

THERAPEUTICS
Hypochloremia
1Therapy is directed at correcting the chloride deficit. This is usually achieved by
administering 0.9%NaCl.
When hypokalemia is also present, potassium chloride can be added to the fluid
therapy.
 In the rare instance where volume expansion is not required, therapy with potassium
chloride or ammonium chloride can be given.
182
BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ The use of sodium chloride or potassium chloride requires intact renal function and
the use of ammonium chloride requires both renal and hepatic function.
Hyperchloremia
■ Therapy is directed at correcting the underlying disease.
■ It is important to consider the chloride content of commonly administered fluids as
they often have chloride concentrations in excess of normal plasma
■In severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2), ammonium chloride therapy may be
considered.

calcium.
■ Phosphate is the major intracellular anion.
■ Movement into or out of the intracellular compartment can rapidly change the con-

■ The majority of total body phosphorus is found in bone or soft tissue. Less than l
percent of the total body phosphorus is found within the extracellular fluid
compartment.
 Dogs younger than I year may have hyperphosphatemia, which is considered normal.

Disorder of Sodium
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Disorders of sodium include hypernatremic and hyponatremic states.
Sodium disorders reflect derangements of water balance. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand water balance when approaching sodium disorders
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Hypernatremia occurs through three different mechanisms.
■ Pure water loss in which either water is lost through the kidneys (diabetes
insipidus) or water is not consumed appropriately to meet insensible loss
(hypodipsia).
■Hypotonic fluid loss in which the loss of free water occurs in excess of the loss
of solute. This may occur from either renal or extrarenal causes.
■ Impermeant solute gain is a true increase in the solute concentration.
Systems Affected
Hypernatremia
 Cardiovascular-In the loss of hypotonic fluid or pure water deficits, the lost volume
 can contribute to interstitial dehydration and compromise of the effective circulating
volume.
■ Nervous—Increases in osmolality result in the osmotic movement of water out the
 brain cells. Rapid changes can result in cerebral hemorrhage.
■ Respiratory—With a true gain of sodium, volume overload and pulmonary edema
may be seen.
Hyponatremia
■ Hyponatremia is usually associated with hypo-osmolality. The approach to hypona-
tremia therefore centers around the plasma osmolality.
■Hyponatremia (normal plasma osmolality)—occurs due to laboratory error (i.e.,
hyperlipemia or hyperproteinemia).
189
190
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Hyponatremia (high plasma osmolality >3l0 mOsm/kg) occurs with the addition
of an impermeant solute to the ECF If this solute is not sodium, there is a relative
decrease in the serum sodium concentration, but the osmolality is increased. An
example would be the intravenous infusion of mannitol.
■Hyponatremia (low plasma osmolality <290 mOsm/kg) occurs when the relative
concentration of sodium is less than normal compared to the volume of the ECF
This can occur in hypervolemia, normovolemia, or hypovolemia.
■Cardiovascular—As with hypernatremia, some hyponatremic animals have compro-
mise of the effective circulating volume.
■  Nervous—-Impairment again is related to rapidity of changes in osmolality.
■ With chronic hyperosmolality, the brain will produce idiogenic osmoles, which
 prevent dehydration of the brain and allow the animal to be relatively asymptomatic.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Risk Factors/Causes
■ In the case of pure water deficits, animals without access to water are at risk.
■Animals whose primary access to water is salt water (playing on the beach) may be
at risk for true salt gain.
Historical Findings
■ Historical findings in acute hypernatremia may include failure to provide the animal
access to water or the compromise of that water supply
■  In the case of acute hyponatremia, historical findings may include the ingestion of
a large volume of water prior to the onset of clinical signs.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Often the clinical features are nonspecific but may include anorexia, lethargy, vomit-
ing, muscle weakness, behavioral changes, disorientation, ataxia, seizures, coma, and
death.
■ Clinical signs may also be referable to the underlying cause.

■
 Therapy is directed at replacing the free water deficit.
PNa(previous)
 If the sodium prior to water loss is unknown, assume a normal serum sodium.
This equation provides the total water deficit in liters.
When replacing a water deficit, intravenous sources of water include 5% dextrose
in water or 0.45% NaCl.
■ When using 5% dextrose in water the entire volume administered will be free
water. Half of the volume of 0.45% NaCl will be free water.
tions can result in rapid changes in osmolality myelinolysis and cerebral
edema.
■Hypotonic fluid loss
■Hypernatremia in this situation is complicated by more severe extracellular volume
contraction than pure water loss alone.
■ Initial fluid resuscitation should be an isotonic replacement fluid (Normosol-R.
0.9% NaCl) to correct volume deficits
DISORDER OF SODIUM
Once the animal is volume replete, free water deficits can be corrected using 0.45%
NaCl or 5% dextrose in water.
1Gain of impermeant solute (salt poisoning)
■ These animals are often normovolemic to hypervolemic so fluid therapy should
be undertaken cautiously.
In an animal with normal cardiac and renal function, the administration of 5%
dextrose in water will promote diuresis and natriuresis.
■ Animals with cardiac or renal disease may develop pulmonary edema if additional
fluids are administered
■  Diuretics such as furosemide may promote natriuresis and speed the return of the
ECF to normal.
■Hyponatremia
■ Acute, symptomatic hyponatremia is treated with isotonic, crystalloid therapy
(0.9% NaCl,
Normosol-R). Hypertonic solutions (3% NaCl) are not
recommended.
■Chronic hyponatremia is usually asymptomatic due to hypoosmolality and therapy
should be directed at correcting the underlying cause.
■ With some of the underlying diseases, therapy may involve restriction of water
intake, sodium restriction, or diuretic therapy. It is important to diagnose the
underlying disease before advocating water restriction.
COMMENTS
 One key to successful treatment of sodium disturbances is to correct them slowly.
Rapid correction of long-standing derangements can be fatal.

Drowning and Near Drowning
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Drowning—Death from asphyxia within 24 hours of submersion in water.
■
 Near drowning-Water submersion followed by survival for at least 24 hours.
■Further classification may include very cold water (≤° C), cold water (5-20° C), or
warm water (>20° C) submersion injuries.
 Secondary drowning—Death from complications of a submersion event greater than
24 hours after the injury.
 Immersion syndrome—Sudden death due to cardiac arrest after sudden immersion
in cold water.
 Submersion injury—-Any of the above events.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Following submersion, the rise in carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream stimulates
respiration and the animal subsequently aspirates water. In rare cases (approximately
7-10 percent of humans), laryngospasm or hyperventilation prior to submersion
prevents aspiration of water ("dry drowning").
 In experimental dogs, the four phases of drowning include: l) breath holding and
swimming motions, 2) aspiration of water, choking, and struggling, 3) vomiting, and
4) cessation of movement and subsequent death. Similar observations have been

normal ventilation of affected alveoli.
■ Hypertonic seawater aspiration leads to surfactant washout from the aspirated fluid
and diffusion of interstitial water into the alveoli, thus preventing ventilation.
■  Up to 75 percent of blood flow may circulate through hypoventilated lung units fol-
lowing either type of near-drowning injury.
■ The submersion time, water temperature, and type of water (fresh versus salt versus
chemical water) determine the development and severity of organ damage. In some
patients, aspiration of vomitus, sand, silt, and sewage may cause bronchial occlusion,
bronchospasm, pneumonia, and inflammatory changes to the alveolar-capillary
membranes. In addition, postobstructive pulmonary edema may occur in patients
with laryngeal spasm.
■ Water temperature can significantly affect the outcome of animals following near-
drowning. At temperatures below 15°C, there is a rapid loss of body heat, causing 
a more rapid onset of fatigue. In addition, the ability to swim is impaired and cuta-
neous receptors lead to hyperventilation and sensation of dyspnea as soon as the
animal enters the water.

Risk Factors/Causes
■ Drowning and near drownings frequently occur in areas where swimming pools
lakes, rivers, canals, oceans, or ponds are present, although indoor drownings are
also common (i.e., buckets, bathtubs, hot tubs). More drownings may occur in the
summer months.
■ Inadequate safety precautions or owner negligence are the most common causes of
drowning in small animals.
■Animals that are in or near water at the time of a seizure, head trauma, hypoglycemic
event, cardiac arrhythmia, or syncopal episode are also at risk for drowning.

Historical Findings
■ Animal is often observed thrashing or gasping in water or is found motionless in
water.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Dogs and Cats
■Cyanosis, coughing with or without clear to frothy red sputum, apnea, respiratory
distress, auscultable thoracic crackles or wheezes, tachycardia or bradycardia, vomit
ing. obtunded to comatose, with or without hypothermia, or asystole
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Hypothermia, neck trauma, and meningitis should be ruled out
■ In the event of drowning secondary to a seizure, neuromuscular disease, head
trauma, hypoglycemic event, cardiac arrhythmia, or syncopal episode, appropriate
diagnostics should be performed (i.e., lab work, blood pressure monitoring, electro-
cardiogram, spinal radiographs, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and brain imaging).
■ The history at the time of presentation is often informative.
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
■  Inhalation or ingestion of large amounts of fresh water can lead to hemodilution
(decrease in hematocrit and total protein), intravascular hemolysis, and a decrease
in serum sodium, chloride, and urine specific gravity. Inhalation or ingestion of
total protein) as well as an increase in serum sodium, chloride, and urine specific
gravity.
 Acute renal dysfunction or failure may occur in patients who have nearly drowned;
renal values and urine output should be closely monitored.
 Increased liver enzyme activity has been reported in dogs following fresh water
submersion.
 Disseminated intravascular coagulation may develop following a submersion injury
and the resultant hypoxia, hypotension, with or wihout hypothermia. Therefore.
coagulation times, platelet counts, and fibrin(ogen) degradation products or D-dimer
levels should be monitored. Thromboelastography or antithrombin levels may also
be useful.
■ Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in people following a submersion injury and will
cause an increase in creatine kinase levels.
Other Laboratory Tests
■ Arterial blood gas reveals hypoxemia (PaO, < 80 mm Hg), hypoventilation
(PaCO, > 50 mm Hg), hypoglycemia, and acid-base derangements such as a respira-
 tory or metabolic acidosis.
Imaging
Thoracic Radiography
■ Radiographic changes may not be detectable for 24 to 48 hours following the near-
drowning. A reduction in cardiovascular dimensions may be seen upon presentation
if the patient is hypovolemic.
■  Focal or diffuse alveolar pattern may be present due to aspiration pneumonia or
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Mixed bronchial, alveolar, and interstitial pat-
terns may be present, and a radiopaque material filling the airways (*sand broncho-
gram") has been described (Figure 27.1).
■  Progression of pulmonary injury to acute respiratory distress syndrome is possible
and may appear as bilateral, diffuse, symmetrical alveolar infiltrates.
Diagnostic Procedures
■Endotracheal or transtracheal wash with cytologic evaluation and culture with sen-
sitivities is indicated.

the diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltr ates.
DROWNING AND NEAR DROWNING 
199
 Bronchoscopy may be required for removal of aspirated debris or foreign bodies.
 Electrocardiographic monitoring, continuous pulse oximetry, cervical radiographs
or CT, brain MRI or CT, and BAER may be helpful in select cases.
Pathological Findings
■ The lungs of animals that have drowned are often heavy, sink in formalin, and
contain fluid with or without debris that was aspirated within the airways.
 The stomach may also contain ingested water and debris
■ Rhabdomyolysis may be present in some patients.
 Animals that survive for more than 24 to 48 hours may have evidence of pneumonia
acute lung injury/vasculitis, or end organ damage (i.e., kidneys) secondary to
hypoxemia.
 Cerebral edema may be present grossly and histopathologically in some animals.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Mouth-to-muzzle resuscitation should be initiated on site. Airway clearance, if
obstructed, is the first priority. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be necessary.
 Near-drowning victims require emergent, inpatient care.
Oxygen supplementation should be provided.
]
Intubation and mechanical ventilation with PEEP may be required in animals with
 Gravitational drainage or abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) are not recom-
mended in the absence of airway obstruction due to the high risk of regurgitation
and subsequent aspiration of gastric contents.

or pulmonary injury.
Drug(s) of choice
■ Mannitol therapy, 0.5 gm/kg of 25% solution IV over 20 minutes, may be beneficial
in animals with suspected cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressures.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics (i.e., ampicillin 22 mg/kg IV every 8 hours and enrofloxa
cin 10 mg/kg IV every 24 hours in dogs and enrofloxacin 5 mg/kg every 24 hours in
cats) may be necessary if aspiration pneumonia develops, but prophylactic therapy
is not recommended and may predispose to the development of antibiotic resistant
pathogens.
Precautions/Interactions
Corticosteroid therapy is not indicated in near-drowning victims and use of this drug
could be detrimental in animals with aspiration pneumonia.
Diet
■Parenteral nutrition might be necessary for patients that require prolonged anesthesia
for positive pressure ventilation.
Surgical Considerations
■ Patients that develop pulmonary abscessation might require a thoracotomy for the
removal of affected lung lobes.
COMMENTS
Patient Monitoring
   p   o   o n 
mucous membrane color and capillary refill time, urine output, arterial blood pres-
sure, rectal temperature, and neurologic status, with or without central venous pres-
sure should be performed.
■ Arterial blood gas, complete blood count, biochemical profile, coagulogram, and
acid-base status should be rechecked as needed.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Close monitoring of animals (especially young animals or those with seizures or
diseases that might cause syncope) near bodies of water, bathtubs, buckets, and so
on can help prevent near-drowning accidents.
Possible Complications
Patient
 Aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary abscess(es). pulmonary fibrosis, noncardiogenic
pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding:
diarrhea, vomiting. acute renal failure, permanent neurologic derangements, dis-
seminated intravascular coagulation, or central diabetes insipidus
Owner
■ Feelings of guilt and remorse may require counseling.
Expected Course and Prognosis
 The prognosis is directly related to animal's status at time of admission: animals who
present severely acidotic (pH < 7.0), require cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or
mechanical ventilation have a poor prognosis. Unlike human submersion victims, a
retrospective study in dogs found that the level of consciousness at admission was
not associated with outcome

Dystocia and Uterine Inertia
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Most owners lack medical knowledge regarding the birthing process, and as such.
they frequently look to the veterinarian to answer questions and to identify potential
problems. The emergency clinician must therefore be familiar with normal reproduc-
tive behavior in addition to the common complications that may arise. Dystocia can
occur due to either maternal or fetal causes. Uterine inertia is the most common
maternal factor while malposition is the most common fetal factor.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Normal gestation length in the dog may range from 57 to 72 days from the time of
first breeding, with an average length of 65 days.
 If the day of ovulation is known, then the whelping date can be accurately predicted
because 95 percent of bitches will whelp 63 ± 1 day from the date of ovulation.
■ Because cats are induced ovulators, there is generally less variability in gestation
length, which ranges from 63 to 65 days. Ovulation may not take place after the first
breeding however, so in the event of multiple breedings, uncertainties with regard
to gestation length may still be present in the cat.
 As the whelping date approaches, a number of clues may point toward impending
parturition. Mammary development, vulvar enlargement, mucoid vaginal discharge,
and relaxation of the pelvic ligaments are early signs of approaching parturition.
Onset of lactation may be noted in primiparous bitches within 24 hours of parturi-
tion, but in multiparous bitches, lactation may occur several days before
parturition.
■ A sudden drop in body temperature (<99° F) is generally noted within 24 hours of
 q siai asd u ssp yo isan e se sie pe shop  i
finding is not always reliable in cats.
 Normal parturition proceeds in three stages.
 Stage l: The first stage is characterized by subclinical uterine contractions and
 progressive dilation of the cervix. During this stage, which typically lasts for 6 to
24 hours, bitches may show signs of restlessness, apprehension, panting, nesting
behaviors, hiding, and anorexia. Queens may be tachypneic, restless, and vocal or
203
may lie in their nesting boxes, purring. Active expulsion of the fetuses occurs
during the second stage of labor.
■ Stage 2: The first fetus is usually delivered within l hour of onset of stage 2 labor
in cats and dogs, with subsequent deliveries every 15 minutes to 4 hours. The
entire process generally occurs over 2 to 12 hours, but may take as long as 24
hours with large litter sizes.
should be identified for each fetus delivered. Placentas are usually still attached
to the fetus by the umbilical cord and emerge with the fetus, but may emerge
within 15 minutes to several hours if they become detached. Lochia, a greenish
vaginal discharge, indicates placental separation and may be seen during all stages
of labor.
■ Following parturition, the discharge gradually becomes red-brown, decreasing in
volume over 4 to 6 weeks as uterine involution takes place.
Dystocia
  Dystocia may result from either maternal or fetal factors that prevent delivery from
taking place. Uterine inertia is the most common maternal cause of dystocia, seen
when the myometrium produces only weak and infrequent contractions that fail to
expel a normal fetus through a normal birth canal.
■Primary uterine inertia is diagnosed when gestation has exceeded its expected length
with no evidence of progression into active labor. Primary uterine inertia is termed
partial if the bitch initiates parturition and expels one or more healthy fetuses, but
then subsequently fails to deliver the remaining fetuses as a result of myometrial
fatigue.
■ Morphologic causes of dystocia are those in which an anatomic abnormality of the
bitch or queen results in obstruction of the birth canal (e.g., small birth canal, pelvic
fractures).
 Fetal factors that may result in dystocia include malpresentation, oversize, fetal mal-
formations, and fetal death. It should be noted that posterior presentations are con-
sidered to be a normal variation in dogs and cats, occurring in approximately 40
 percent of deliveries.
pregnancies (Figure 28.1). Fetal death is an infrequent cause of dystocia, increasing
the likelihood of malpresentation because of failure to rotate and extend the head
and legs, which commonly occurs immediately prior to parturition.
 Fetal malformations are another potential cause of dystocia, with anasarca (general-
ized subcutaneous edema), hydrocephalus, cerebral and cerebrospinal hernias,
the more commonly noted.

205
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Primiparous bitches less than 2 years of age are predisposed to dystocia.
■ Toy and small brachycephalic breeds, particularly bulldogs, are predisposed to
dystocia.
 Signs of dystocia include: active uterine contraction lasting more than l hour without
passing a fetus, more than 3 to 4 hours without any active uterine contraction, and
failure to initiate labor at the end of gestation.
Risk Factors/Causes
  Very large or very small litters predispose to dystocia
Historical Findings
■Most often the owner observes a change in behavior that may or may not be associ-
ated with the passing ofa fetus. Most commonly, the owner will note active contrac-
tions without passing a fetus, or a period of more than 3 to 4 hours between puppies
or kittens.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ On physical examination the queen or bitch may be crying and biting at the
vulvar area, have abnormal vaginal discharge (i.e., profuse hemorrhage; odorous
mucopurulent discharge; green discharge without production of offspring, indicat-
ing placental separation), or signs of systemic illness in the dam—fever, weakness
tremors, etc.
■A vaginal examination should be performed using sterile technique.
DIAGNOSTICS
  Radiographs should be obtained in any animal experiencing dystocia. Radiographs
are accurate for assessing the number, size, location, and position of fetuses, as well
as maternal pelvic morphology and general status of the abdomen. Fetal viability is
more difficult to assess from radiographs, unless evidence of fetal decomposition is
present. Signs of decomposition include intrafetal or intrauterine gas patterns.
awkward fetal postures, collapse of the spinal column due to loss of muscular
support, and overlapping of the bones of the skull.
■  Ultrasound may be a more useful tool for assessment of fetal viability, fetal malfor-
mations, and fetal distress. Normal fetal heart rates have been reported at 180 to 245
beats per minute in dogs and up to approximately 265 beats per minute in cats.
Deceleration of fetal heart rates to less than 180 beats per minute and the presence
DYSTOCIA AND UTERINE INERTIA207
of fetal bowel movements on ultrasound have been shown to correlate with severe
fetal distress and may indicate a need for rapid intervention.
1A minimum database should include PCV/TS, serum calcium level, and blood
glucose.
THERAPEUTICS
■If a fetus is in the birth canal, an attempt should be made to remove it with copious
lubrication and gentle, steady traction in a posterior/ventral direction. Best results
are obtained with the dam standing while using combined caudal abdominal palpa-
tion to direct the fetus into the birth canal. Obstetrical instruments should be avoided
if at all possible.
■ Medical management with oxytocin should be considered if there is no evidence of
obstruction, and fetal and pelvic size appears normal. Calcium gluconate may be
considered if weak, infrequent contractions are noted or when lab work reveals
hypocalcemia. Retrospective studies have indicated that many patients who fail to
respond to oxytocin alone may respond to a combination of calcium and oxytocin.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Oxytocin doses of 0.5-2 units are effective in increasing the frequency and quality
of contraction. The oxytocin dose may be repeated in 30 minutes if expulsion of a
fetus has not resulted. If labor proceeds and a fetus is delivered, oxytocin may be
repeated every 30 minutes as needed to assist in expulsion of the remaining fetuses.
If 2 doses of oxytocin fail to deliver a fetus, subsequent doses are not recommended.
Note that prior to administration of oxytocin, clients should be cautioned that uterine
rupture is a rare but possible complication.
1 The dose for calcium gluconate (l0 percent solution) as a uterotonic agent is ll mg/
kg diluted in saline and given subcutaneously, or added to intravenous fluids and
given slowly while monitoring an ECG for dysrhythmias.
■If hypocalcemia is documented, a dose of 50 to 150 mg/kg IV should be used.
■
 Subcutaneous administration has been reported to result in irritation and potential
granuloma formation, though this is an infrequent complication.
Surgical Considerations
 Surgical management should be considered for the following conditions:
■  Complete primary uterine inertia
■ Partial primary uterine inertia or secondary uterine inertia where large numbers
 of feti remain and response to drugs is unsatisfactory
■ Fetal oversize
 Gross abnormalities of maternal pelvis (fractures, masses)
 Fetal malformations
 Malpresentation that is not amenable to manipulation

Anesthesia
■ An anesthetic protocol for c-section should be selected with the goal of maximizing
survival of neonates and dam.
■Attempts should be made to minimize exposure of the fetus to anesthetics by keeping
the time from induction to delivery as short as possible.
■ Ideally, the dam should be clipped and prepped prior to induction (Figure 28.4).
 equipment should be out, and the surgeon should be scrubbed and ready.
■ Induction agents (i.e., propofol 4-7 mg/kg IV slowly) should be given to effect.
■ Propofol (4-6mg/kg IV) or mask inductions are most commonly used for c-
section at this time and have been associated with reduced neonatal mortality in
dogs.
 Regional techniques such as line blocks and epidurals may help to minimize the need
for other drugs.
■A line block can be performed using 2 mg/kg lidocaine infused along the ventral
midline.
■Alternately, epidural lidocaine may be administered in dogs at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/
kg. not to exceed a total volume of 6 ml.

COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Owners of pregnant dogs or cats should be educated about the clinical signs of dys-
tocia and given clear instructions concerning when veterinary intervention is required
Expected Course and Prognosis
 The prognosis for medical management of dystocia is guarded, with success rates of
20 to 40 percent in the veterinary literature. Additionally, stillbirth rates have been
shown to rise when dystocia is allowed to continue for greater than 4.5 to 6 hours
from the time of onset of second stage labor in the dog. For these reasons, the deci-
sion to proceed to c-section should not be delayed if response to medical manage-
ment is poor or unlikely to result in successful delivery. In recent studies, neonatal
survival rates following surgical treatment of dystocia have been reported at 92
percent at birth, with 80 percent still alive at 7 days post c-section.

Electric Cord Injury
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Electric cord injury is an uncommon event that occurs when an animal bites an
electric cord.
 Other causes of electrocution are uncommon in dogs and cats but can occur.
Household electrical currents are alternating (60 Hz) and dangerous.
 Injury can be due to thermal injury or due to disruption of normal electrophysiologic
activity of excitable tissue.
 Pulmonary edema can be a sequela to electrocution and the pathophysiology is
 thought to be noncardiogenic and likely neurogenic and centrally medicated leading
to pulmonary hypertension.
 Cataract formation has been reported following electrocution.

Esophageal Foreign Body
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Occurs when a solid object becomes lodged in the esophagus.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Foreign objects are too large or irregular to pass through the esophagus and become
wedged at normal points of narrowing including the thoracic inlet, at the heart base,
and distal esophagus.
 Occasionally smaller items (e.g., kibble) become lodged proximal to an esophageal
stricture.
Common esophageal foreign bodies include bones, chew toys, fish hooks, dental
chew treats, and hair balls (cats).
Systems Affected
■ Gastrointestinal—-Esophageal obstruction, esophageal stricture
 Respiratory—Hypoxia, respiratory alkalosis, or pneumonia
■Acid-base
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
1Small breed dogs are more frequently affected with as many as 84 percent of esopha-
geal foreign bodies occurring in dogs <8kg when dental chew treats are responsible,
s  s   n    e 
No sex, breed, or age predilection; although younger animals more often have dietary
indiscretion.
Risk Factors/Causes
■  Preexisting esophageal stricture
225
226
Historical Findings
■ The most common clinical signs include gagging, regurgitation, vomiting, anorexia,
pytalism, lethargy, and cough.
 Ptyalism is observed more frequently in cats.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Most commonly gagging or dysphagia, regurgitation, anorexia, ptyalism, lethargy.
 cough, pain and frequent swallowing.
■Ptyalism is observed more frequently in cats.
 Tachypnea can be present due to concurrent pneumonia or pain.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■Esophagitis
■ Megaesophagus, primary or secondary
 Esophageal stricture
Vascular ring anomaly
■
 Esophageal neoplasia
DIAGNOSTICS
Thoracic and Cervical Radiographs
■ Often reveal an esophageal foreign body; although it can be poorly defined and
 appear as a focal soft tissue density (Figure 3l.1).
■ The opposite lateral view can be helpful when the foreign body is poorly
delineated.
■Pneumomediastinum, mediastinal edema, or pleural effusion are suggestive of poten-
tial esophageal perforation.
Radiographic Contrast Esophagram
■ Some esophageal foreign bodies require radiographic contrast swallow to aid delinea-
tion, especially dental chew treats. Avoid barium if there is risk of aspiration.
Esophagoscopy
■Foreign body will be readily visualized (Figure 3l.2)

227
Pathological Findings
■ Esophageal foreign bodies can lead to significant esophageal inflammation, which
leads to a greater risk of stricture or cicatrix formation.
■Pressure necrosis and esophageal perforation can also develop.
■ Esophageal perforation will lead to local inflammation and infection (mediastinitis/
pleuritis): pneumomediastinum may also be present.
THERAPEUTICS
■ The goal of therapy is to remove the foreign body and avoid complications
■ Esophageal foreign bodies are often removed via endoscopic techniques; orad removal
 is preferred and achieved in approximately 80 percent of cases. Various graspers and
forceps are utilized.
When objects are difficult to grasp, an inflatable object (e.g., Foley urinary catheter)
can be passed distal to the object. The balloon is subsequently inflated, and the
catheter withdrawn to pull the foreign object orad.
■ If the foreign object cannot be removed in an orad direction, then attempts should
be made to push it into the stomach. The endoscope itself or other rigid objects (e.g..
orogastric tube, long handled forceps, well-lubricated piece of PVC pipe) can be
utilized.
■ Judicious caution must be employed to avoid damaging a friable esophagus that
might lead to esophageal perforation.
Drug(s) of choice
■Antacids are often utilized following foreign body removal.
H, antagonists (famotidine, 0.5 mg/kg twice a day)
■ Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, 0.7-1.0 mg/kg PO twice a day), and sucral-
fate (0.5-1.0g PO three times a day)
■
Analgesics are indicated as esophageal injury is often painful.
 Opioids (e.g., tramadol 1-4 mg/kg two to three times a day)
■ Avoid NSAIDs for management of pain following esophageal foreign body removal.
■  Topical anesthesia can be fashioned with oral lidocaine mixtures.
Diet
■ Gastrostomy tubes should be considered when there is severe esophageal inflamma-
tion and risk of developing an esophageal stricture.
Activity
ESOPHAGEAL FOREIGN BODY229
Surgical Considerations
bodies cannot be removed or esophageal perforation has occurred.
Gastrotomy should be performed for esophageal foreign bodies that are advanced
into the stomach and are likely to cause gastric or intestinal obstruction. Bone foreign
bodies will often dissolve, however can possibly cause an obstruction if they move
into the intestinal tract.
COMMENTS
 Foreign body removal with rigid endoscopes has been reported to be more successful
that flexible endoscopes.
 Repeat thoracic radiographs to assess for esophageal perforation (e.g. pneumomedi-
astinum Figure 31.3) following foreign body retrieval should be considered when
retrieval was difficult or the esophagus is particularly damaged.
to 2 weeks to examine for esophageal stricture formation.
Client Education
■Following esophageal foreign body removal, clients should monitor closely for signs
of regurgitation, which may indicate development of an esophageal stricture or
cicatrix.

BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Bones, large chew toys, and dental chew treats should be avoided.
Possible Complications
■ Esophageal stricture, approximately 10 to 20 percent of cases; more frequently with
dental chew treats
■ Esophagitis; more frequently with dental chew treats
■ Esophageal perforation and mediastinitis/pleuritis, approximately 12 percent of cases
Expected Course and Prognosis
o      s  n  n  i  
foreign bodies due to dental chew treats tend to have more complications (e.g. per-
foration or stricture) and a higher mortality rate.

Feline Bronchitis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Chronic bronchitis—inflammation in the airways (bronchi and bronchioles); pres-
   n     e   s
siveness of the airways to various stimuli, airway narrowing due to smooth muscle
hypertrophy/constriction, reversibility of airway constriction, and presence of eosin-
ophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells within the airways.
These criteria are often difficult to determine or document, thus FBD is used more
commonly to describe the clinical disease in cats of acute or chronic coughing or
wheezing accompanied by lower airway inflammation.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Noxious or allergic stimuli trigger inflammation within the lower airways. The
inflammatory mediators cause mucosal airway damage that releases more inflamma-
tory mediators.
■ Bronchiolar smooth muscle constriction—reversible either spontaneously or  in
response to anti-inflammatory drugs.
■ Increase in mucosal goblet cells, mucus production, and edema of bronchial
wall.
Excessive mucus can cause bronchiolar obstruction and lead to atelectasis or bron-
chiectasis (dilated airways often obstructed with mucus).
■ Chronic inflammation within the airways may lead to fibrosis and lung atelectasis.
Systems Affected
■ Respiratory
 Cardiac—chronic airway disease can lead to pulmonary hypertension and secondary
right-sided heart disease.
231

BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Geographic Distribution
■ Worldwide. Parasitic causes of airway inflammation are more common in southern
and midwest U.S. states. Heartworm disease is more prevalent in southern U.S. states.
Paragonimus kellicotti is found in Great Lakes region.
SIGNALMENT
Species
■Cats
Breed Predilections
■ Siamese overrepresented
 Mean Age and Range
■ Any age; more common between 2 and 8 years.
Predominant Sex
■ One study shows females overrepresented; however this is not a consistent finding.
Historical Findings
■ Coughing (80 percent), sneezing (60 percent), labored breathing or wheezing (40
percent)
■Signs are typically episodic and can be acute or chronic.
■  Lethargy and inappetence are occasionally reported.
Physical Examination Findings
■ Severely affected cats may present with open-mouth breathing, tachypnea, and
cyanosis.
 Increased tracheal sensitivity is common.
■
 Chest auscultation may reveal crackles or expiratory wheezes or may be normal.
■ Labored breathing. typically a moderate to severe increase in expiratory effort with
an abdominal push on expiration. Inspiratory effort is usually much less affected.
■ Heart rate is typically normal to bradycardic, although stress may result in
tachycardia.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Exposure to cigarette smoke, dusty cat litter, hair sprays, and air fresheners could
possibly exacerbate disease in some cats.
FELINE BRONCHITIS233
■ Parasitic lung infections are more common in outdoor cats in certain geographic
locations.
■  Use of potassium bromide has been implicated as a cause for signs of bronchitis or
asthma in some cats.
 Triggers of airway inflammation are largely unknown.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Diseases primarily affecting lung parenchyma. Rule out infectious pneumonia (toxo-
plasmosis, FIP, bacterial pneumonia, histoplasmosis)
■ Dirofilaria immitis (heartworm) and primary lung parasites (Aelurostrongylus abstru-
sus, Capillaria aerophilia, and Paragonimus kellicotti)
Primary or metastatic neoplasia also similar in clinical, and occasionally, radio-
graphic appearance.
 Primary cardiac disease may appear clinically and radiographically similar in certain
instances, but these cats typically do not have a history of cough or have tracheal
sensitivity on physical examination.
■ Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may present clinically and diagnostically very similar
to feline bronchitis.
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
■Frequently normal
 Less than 40 percent of cats with allergic airway disease have a peripheral eosino.

philic pulmonary granulomatosis.
Other Laboratory Tests
■Fecal exams—flotation examination for Capillaria; sedimentation for Paragonimus,
Baermann technique for Aelurostrongylus. False-negatives occur.
Heartworm testing—-both antigen and antibody test recommended
 Pulmonary lung function testing—available in select academic institutions or spe-
cialty practices. Increased airway resistance is the classic finding; affects expiratory
parameters more than inspiratory.

Echocardiography
■May be useful when evaluating for the possibility of heartworm disease or pulmonary
hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease
Diagnostic Procedures
Transoral TrachealWash
■ Use a sterile endotracheal tube and polypropylene catheter for obtaining a cytologic
sample; this allows for sampling of airway fluids at the level of the carina.

Bronchoscopy/Bronchoalveolar Lavage
■Allows for visualization of trachea and bronchi. Excessive amounts of thick mucus
 are common with bronchitis. Mucosa of the airways is typically hyperemic and
edematous.
■ Biopsy or endoscopic brushing possible, although typically not needed with cases of
bronchitis
■ BAL should be performed during bronchoscopy; this allows for sampling of airway
fluids from areas that appear most affected.
Cytology
■  Eosinophils and neutrophils are most prominent cell types. A mixed cell population
occurs in about 2l percent of cats.
■In one study. 22 percent of

(Table 32.1).
Bacterial Cultures
■ Quantitated cultures are recommended. Significant bacterial colony counts are
uncommonly obtained in FBD. Significant bacterial growth on a quantitative culture
is suggested to be >100 to 300 cfu/ml.
Mycoplasma has been isolated from 2l to 44 percent of cats with FBD and was not
isolated from healthy cats. Its role in bronchitis remains controversial.

Pathologic Findings
■ Histologic findings consistent with FBD include hyperplasia/hypertrophy of goblet
cells, airway smooth muscle thickening, epithelial erosion, and inflammatory
infiltrates.
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
Emergency Treatment
■ Combine the use of oxygen and a parenteral bronchodilator. A sedative often aids
in decreasing anxiety associated with hypoxia. A short-acting parenteral corticoste-
roid may also be required. Patient manipulation should be minimized in order to
avoid worsening respiratory distress.
■ Injectable terbutaline (O.0l mg/kg IV or SQ). You can repeat this dose if no clinical
improvement (decrease in respiratory rate or effort) in 20 to 30 minutes.
 Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.25-0.5 mg/kg. given IV or SQ). Can repeat if
no improvement visible within 20 to 30 minutes. Prednisolone sodium succinate
(Solu-Delta-Cortef) can also be used (50-100 mg IV).
 Butorphanol tartrate (0.4 mg.kgIV or IM) can be used for sedation. Also consider
buprenorphine at (0.01 mg/kg) or acepromazine (0.0.01-0.05 mg/kg)
Long-Term Management
Corticosteroids
■]
 Decrease inflammation
■ Oral treatment is preferred over injectable because doses and duration can be more
closely monitored.
 Prednisolone: 0.5 to 1mg/kg PO every 12 hours. Begin to taper dose (50 percent
each week) after 2 weeks if clinical signs have improved. If clinical signs resurface,
dose should be increased again to 0.5 to 1 mg/kg PO every 12 hours. Maintenance
therapy: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg PO every 24 to 48 hours. Some patients may be able to use
steroids on a seasonal basis only.
 Dexamethasone sodium phosphate—used mainly for an acute crisis
■ Longer-acting parenteral steroids (Vetalog or Depomedrol) should be reserved
for situations where owners are unable to administer oral medication on a routine
basis.

BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
 Figure 32.4 Inhalation therapy with a metered dose inhaler and face mask in a cat with lower airway disease
Inhaled Corticosteroids
■ Newer therapy—requires a form-fitting facemask, spacer, and MDl (Figure 32.4).
Veterinary brands include Aerokat (Trudell medical) or Nebulair (DVM
pharmaceuticals).
■ The most commonly used corticosteroid used in cats as an MDI is fluticasone pro-
 pionate (Flovent). The 220-μg or 1l0-μig Flovent MD1 is recommended (2 actua-
tions, 7-l0 breaths every 12 hours) along with other bronchodilators and oral
corticosteroids, depending on the severity of clinical signs. One study has shown the
44-μg MDl to be efficacious in decreasing BAL eosinophil counts in experimentally
induced asthma. The 44-μg Flovent MD1 is only recommended after it has been
established that inhalant corticosteroids are effcacious for that individual patient.
■ Flovent is used for long-term control of airway inflammation. Takes 10 to 14 days
to reach peak effect; during this time oral steroids should be used concurrently
■ It has been shown that there is some suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
in cats with the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Systemic side effects appear to be
significantly less than with parenteral or oral medications.
■ Methylxanthines (i.e., theophylline and aminophylline)—inhibit smooth muscle
constriction. The pharmacokinetics of aminophylline would suggest that it is unlikely
recommended, however the pharmacokinetics can vary greatly depending on the
brand. The most recent recommended brands (Inwood brand at 10-15 mg/kg PO
once a day) are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain.
■β2 agonists (i.e., terbutaline, albuterol)—inhibit smooth muscle constriction.
Injectable terbutaline is most helpful in a distressed animal (o.0l mg/kg SQ or IV).
Oral terbutaline dose is one-fourth of a 2.5-mg tablet PO every 12 hours. The phar-
 macokinetics of oral terbutaline in cats is unknown. Initial albuterol dose is 20 μg/
kg PO every 12 hours; it can be increased to 50 μg/kg PO every 8 hours.
InhaledBronchodilators
■Albuterol is the preferred inhalant bronchodilator therapy in cats, providing immedi-
ate relief of bronchoconstriction—-its effect lasts less than 4 hours. Recommended as
FELINE BRONCHITIS239
adjuvant therapy in moderately to severely affected cats (every 12-24 hours) or
during respiratory distress.
Anthelminthics
■ They are routinely recommended for cats with clinical signs of FBD and airway
cytology that is predominantly eosinophilic. Parasitic bronchitis can be difficult to
cated with appropriate clinical signs and geographic location.
■  Appropriate medication will depend on specific parasite suspected in the geographic
region. Consider fenbendazole, ivermectin, or praziquantel.
Antibiotics
■ Use should be based on a positive quantitative culture. Choice of antibiotic therapy
is based on susceptibility testing.
Contraindications
■β antagonists (e.g., propranolol) are contraindicated because of their ability to block
sympathetically mediated bronchodilation.
Precautions/Interactions
 Bronchodilators may exacerbate underlying cardiac disease.
 Long-term use of steroids increases risk of development of diabetes mellitus and
predisposes to immunosuppression.
 Use of corticosteroids in cats may unmask occult cardiomyopathy and precipitate
congestive heart failure.
 Fluoroquinolones decrease the metabolism of methylxanthines in dogs, although this
has not been investigated in cats. Consider decreasing the dose of methylxanthine
by 50 percent when used concurrently with a fluoroquinolone. Watch for toxic side
effects of the methylxanthine (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia).
Alternative Drugs
Cyproheptadine
 Serotonin antagonist. Has been shown in vitro to inhibit airway smooth muscle
constriction in cats with experimentally induced asthma and should be used only in
 patients refractory to other therapy.
Cyclosporine (Neoral or Gengraf)
 Give 2.5 to 5.0 mg/kg every 12 hours: monitor cyclosporine levels.
■ May be helpful in patients refractory to bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy
■ Leukotriene inhibitors or receptor blockers
■ No evidence to support the use of these drugs in FBD

Activity
■  Usually self-limited by patient
Diet
■Calorie restriction for obese cats
Appropriate Health Care
Removal of patient from the inciting environment may help.
■ Patient should be hospitalized for an acute crisis of respiratory distress
Nursing Care
■ Oxygen therapy and sedatives may help in an acute crisis. Minimize manipulation
during a crisis in order to lessen stress and oxygen needs of the animal.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Most causes of bronchitis are chronic, progressive diseases.
■ Do not discontinue medical therapy when clinical signs have resolved; subclinical
 inflammation within the lungs is common and can lead to progression of disease.
■ Lifelong medication and environmental changes may be necessary.
■ Some clients can be taught to give terbutaline subcutaneously and corticosteroid
injections at home for a crisis situation.
Patient Monitoring
■ Owners should watch for and report any increase in coughing, sneezing, wheezing.
 or respiratory distress. Medications should be increased appropriately if clinical signs
recur.
■Follow up radiographs are helpful in the first weeks after initial diagnosis to evaluate
 improvement with medical therapy.
  Long-term use of corticosteroids will require blood glucose monitoring every 3 to 6
months to screen for diabetes mellitus. Urinary tract infections can occur owing to
immunosuppression. Owner should watch for signs of PU/PD that may indicate
diabetes mellitus or renal disease.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Eliminate any environmental factors that may trigger a crisis situation (see Risk
Factors/Causes).
■  Change furnace and air conditioner filters on a regular basis.
■Consider dust-free litters.
FELINE BRONCHITIS 
241
Possible Complications
■Refractory cases or untreated acute episodes can be life threatening.
 Right-sided heart disease may develop as a result of long-term bronchitis.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Long-term therapy should be expected.
■
 Most cats do well if recurrence of clinical signs is carefully monitored and medical
 therapy appropriately adjusted.
■ A few cats will be refractory to treatment; these carry a much worse prognosis.
Associated Conditions
Cor pulmonale can be a sequela to chronic lower airway disease.
Pregnancy/Fertility/Breeding
■ Glucocorticoids are contraindicated in the pregnant animal. Bronchodilators should
be used with caution.

Feline Panleukopenia (FPL
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ FPL is the common term used to describe a systemic, immunosuppressive disease of
cats caused by highly contagious FVP.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 FPL virus (also FPV) is a single-stranded DNA virus
■ Because FVPs are contagious and resilient to destruction, the virus is found world-
wide and continues to pose a significant threat to all members of the family Felidae.
 (d ) s    s  a  
gests that exposure rates are high, but most clinical infections are subclinical.
 Transmission of virus can occur following direct cat-to-cat contact as well as follow-
ing indirect, oral contact with contaminated fomites (e.g., litter trays, hands, feeding
dishes, cages, bedding).
■  Infected cats usually shed virus for 1 to 2 days, however, recovering cats may shed
virus in feces and urine for as long as 6 weeks.
■
The ability of the virus to persist in the environment for sustained periods, rather
than shedding. explains how the virus is maintained in the population.
 Virus undergoes initial replication in oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue within the first
week post-infection then disseminates via plasma to virtually all body tissues, par-
ticularly those with high mitotic activity (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract). Damage to
intestinal crypt epithelium culminates in malabsorptive disorders and diarrhea.
■ Virus replication in the CNS can occur subsequent to in utero infection of healthy
queens.
■ FPV can infect fetal CNS tissues subsequent to vaccination of pregnant queens with
MLV vaccine.
■ Neonates vaccinated with MLV FPV vaccine prior to 4 weeks of age can experience
vaccine virus dissemination and replication in the CNS. Viral DNA can be found in
optic nerves, retina, and cerebellum.
 Cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens can be caused by FPV infection and MLV virus.
Prenatal and neonatal infections have been associated with feline myocarditis and
cardiomyopathy.
243
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
  Most infections are subclinical, however severe clinical illness caused by FPV is most
common among young kittens
■ Mortality is greatest between 3 and 5 months of age.
■ FPV is also regarded as a cause of "fading kitten" syndrome (death occurring after
birth but before weaning). The course of infection is acute with most deaths occur-
ring as early as 12 hours to 5 days post-infection.
■ Cats that survive acute illness for more than 5 days have a better prognosis for sur-
vival with supportive care.
■ Clinical signs of inappetence and lethargy, followed by vomiting within 2 to 3 days.
■ No gender or breed predisposition for FPV infection.
■ Outbreaks of FPV have been reported in adult cats, particularly in high-density
housing environments where seroprevalence can be particularly low (e.g., shelters,
rescue groups).
CLINICAL FEATURES
High fever (104°-107° F)
■Dehydration
■ Evidence of vomiting may be present on the hair coat around the face.
■
 Diarrhea is uncommon and, when seen, usually occurs in the later stages of
infection.
■  Affected cats may resist abdominal palpation; palpation of thickened (rope-like con-
sistency) intestines and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes is characteristic
■If treatment is delayed, cats may become profoundly lethargic or comatose, dehy-
drated, and hypothermic.
■ Death attributed to secondary bacterial infection, DlC, or severe dehydration is
common among kittens with acute, untreated FPV infection.
■ Kittens infected in utero or vaccinated early in life with MLV FPV vaccine (<4 weeks
of age) may manifest neurologic signs: ataxia, incoordination, and intention tremors
typically associated with cerebellar hypoplasia. Affected kittens walk with a wide
stance and a characteristic hypermetric gait. Neurologic manifestations are typically
absent when the cat is at rest.

DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count
■Severely affected kittens may have total white blood cell counts between 50 and 3000
cells/μL.
■ Less severely affected cats may have counts between 3000 and 7000 cells/μL.
■ Cats that recover from acute FPV infection will manifest rebound leukocytosis with
white blood cell counts exceeding 30,000 cells/μL
 Anemia and thrombocytopenia are less common; variable laboratory findings
Biochemistry
■ No specific biochemical abnormalities occur in cats with FPL.
Serology
 Serological testing (virus neutralization is recommended) and virus isolation for the
diagnosis of FPL are available from selected laboratories but these methods offer little
value in the clinical setting due to the short clinical course.
 Serological testing is generally reserved for assessment of a protective immune
response in vaccinated or exposed cats.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
■ ELISA-based canine parvovirus test for the presence of fecal antigen can be used in
cats; however important limitations apply.
 The canine fecal antigen tests have not been standardized for use in cats with con-
firmed FPV infection.
■ Furthermore, fecal shedding of FPV in cats may cease prior to the onset of clinical
signs.
Histopathology
■Histopathology remains the confirmatory diagnostic test of choice for FPL.
Pathological Findings
■ Gross pathological findings in cats that die of complications from FPV infection are
minimal and usually limited to the small intestine (i.e., dilated bowel and serosal
hemorrhages).

jejunum and ileum and lymphoid depletion.
■ Cerebellar degeneration and hypoplasia (Figure 33.l) may be seen in kittens that
experienced neonatal or in utero infection from FPV or MLV FPV vaccine.
THERAPEUTICS
■Parenteral fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy
■  Insensible fluid loss should be replaced at the rate of 44 ml/kg per day using lactated
Ringer's solution with supplemental potassium as indicated.
Nutritional Support
■Oral administration of food or liquid should be avoided during the acute clinical
infection.
Antiemetic Therapy
■ Plasma or blood transfusions are limited to patients that become anemic or hypo-
proteinemic (<5.0 g/dL).
General
■Antibiotic therapy (Ampicillin 22 mg/kg IV every 6 hours)
B-vitamin combination
FELINE PANLEUKOPENIA (FPL)247
■ Parenteral therapy should be continued at least until vomiting ceases and the cat
resumes eating.
 Low-dose diazepam (2.5mg total) may be administered to promote eating in cats
that have stopped vomiting and appear to be making a clinical recovery (interest in
food, leukocytosis).
Early Vaccination
■  Initial vaccination of kittens beginning at 4 weeks of age, and every 2 to 4 weeks
thereafter until 16 weeks of age, is only recommended in group-housed cats where
a reasonable risk of FPV exposure exists (e.g., shelter-housed kittens).
■ Early vaccination is most likely to be effective in colostrum-deprived kittens
Modified-Live Vaccine versus Inactived Vaccine
 The author recommends use of MLV (non-adjuvanted) FPV vaccines in all cats with
the exception of cats known to be positive for FeLV or FIV and kittens less than 6
weeks of age.
■  In the event vaccination of a pregnant queen is indicated, use of an inactivated
vaccine is recommended to reduce risk of vaccine virus replication in the CNS of
unborn kittens (cerebellar hypoplasia).
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Before introduction of a new cat into a household where a cat/kitten has recently
been diagnosed with, or died from, FPL, all cages, feeding bowls, floors, litter trays,
and such should be thoroughly disinfected (fresh solution containing l ounce house-
hold bleach/gallon of water).
■ Ideally, the facility should be isolated from cats for several days following disinfec-
tion before introducing a new cat.
■  Prior to entry, any new cat/kitten should have received at least 2 doses of vaccine.
with the last dose administered at least 2 weeks prior to introduction.
Controlling Outbreaks
When administering inactivated (killed-adjuvanted) FPV vaccine to cats, a protective
immune response is typically delayed until 2 to 3 weeks following the administration
of the second dose. For this reason, inactivated (killed-adjuvanted) FPV vaccine has
been implicated as a contributing factor in FPL outbreaks within multicat housing
environments.
■In high-exposure risk environments, or in the face of an outbreak, kittens should be
vaccinated with an MLV (non-adjuvanted) vaccine as early as 4 weeks of age and
every 2 weeks thereafter as long as they reside in the facility.
248
BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Prevention/Avoidance
 In the United States both killed-virus (adjuvanted) and MLV vaccines (non-
adjuvanted) are available for the prevention of disease caused by FPV.
 Vaccination provides excellent protective immunity and is recommended for admin-
istration to all kittens beginning as early as 6 weeks of age; a dose should be admin-
istered every 3 to 4 weeks until 15 to 16 weeks of age.
■ Current vaccination recommendations include revaccination of all adult cats l year
following the last dose in the initial series.
 Booster inoculations are recommended triennially thereafter.
■ Vaccine approved for intranasal vaccination of cats against FPL (a trivalent vaccine
for protection against herpesvirus and calicivirus as well as FPV) is available but is
regarded as less effective than parenterally administered vaccines. All intranasal FPV
vaccines are MLV products and should not be administered to kittens less than 4
weeks of age.

Feline Leukemia Virus
Infection (FeLV)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■FeLV is a retrovirus (Y-retrovirus) that causes immunosuppression and lymphocytic
neoplasia in domestic cats.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Horizontal transmission (oronasal or bite wounds); viral replication is in local lym-
phoid tissues, infected cells carry virus to target lymphoid tissues (i.e., thymus,
spleen, and lymph nodes), at which time it is common to see fever, diarrhea, leuko-
penia, lethargy and marked lymphadenopathy. Virus then infects salivary glands and
mucosal glandular epithelium, which secrete virus for horizontal transmission, and
bone marrow, which produces infected WBCs and platelets.
■ Acute infection takes one of three courses: (1) strong immune response that elimi-
nates virus; (2) virus sequestered and causes latency: (3) persistent viremia. If latent
for >lyear, reactivation is unlikely; viremia >l6weeks or bone marrow infected
(detected by IFA) likely viremic, persistently infected, and infectious for life.
1 Tumor induction occurs when DNA provirus integrates into cat chromosomal DNA
in specific oncogene regions.
Systems Affected
1 Hemic/Lymphatic/Immune—anemia (regenerative or nonregenerative); blood cell
dyscrasias; bone marrow and lymphoid neoplasias; immunosuppression with second-
ary infections or neoplasia; immune-mediated diseases (IMHA, glomerulonephritis.
uveitis with immune complex deposition, polyarthritis)
 Nervous—degenerative myelopathy, neuropathies (either direct neurotoxicity or
secondary)
 Gastrointestinal—three clinical syndromes: FAE (i.e., vomiting/diarrhea, stomatitis.
anorexia, weight loss); FAIDS (i.e., enterocolitis, crypt necrosis, villous atrophy
intractable diarrhea and weight loss); FPLS (i.e., severe leukopenia, enteritis, destruc-
tion of crypt epithelium that mimics FPV with concurrent anemia, may actually be
a FPV-FeLV co-infection)
250
 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Reproductive—fetal resorption, abortion, neonatal death; fading kitten syndrome
(i.e., viremic kittens fail to nurse, severe dehydration, hypothermia, thymic atrophy
death within the first 2 weeks of life)
■All other body systems—immunosuppression with resulting secondary infections or
neoplasia
Incidence/Prevalence
■ One to 8 percent worldwide; prevalence in the United States has been decreasing
since the 1980s due to testing and removal programs.
Geographic Distribution
■Worldwide

General Comments
■ Onset of FeLV-associated diseases may be delayed months to years after infection;
clinical signs of virus are variable and nonspecific.
■ Associated diseases—neoplastic or non-neoplastic; non-neoplastic or degenerative

 Neurologic—peripheral or central neuropathies
Neoplasia—lymphoma, especially thymic and multicentric, occurs in up to 25
percent of cats who are positive for FeLV usually within 2 years of diagnosis; leuke-
mias; fibrosarcomas due to co-infection with recombinant FeSV.
Risk Factors/Causes
■Feral or free-roaming cats
■ Male
 Sexually intact
■ Horizontal transmission via saliva or blood, usually by biting. grooming, sharing
water bowls
■ Vertical transmission via transplacental, transmammary, or grooming of neonates
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■FIV
 Primary infections—viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic
■Neoplasia of nonviral origin
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Chemistry/Urinalysis
 Anemia—regenerative or nonregenerative, often severe; occasionally see IMHA
■Lymphopenia
■
 Neutropenia—-possibly in response to secondary infections
■
Thrombocytopenia
■ Urinalysis and serum chemistry profile—findings depend on systems affected and
type of disease
Other Laboratory Tests
■ General comments—no 100% accurate test
■ ELISA/ICGA—detect free soluble FeLV-p27 antigen in plasma, serum, or whole
blood; more sensitive than IFA at detecting early or transient antigenemia; a single
positive test cannot predict persistent infections, retest in 12 weeks or test with IFA;
false-positives more common with whole blood, not recommended to test saliva or
tears.
■ IFA—identify FeLV-p27 antigen in neutrophils and platelets of fixed smears of whole
blood or buffy coat preparations (for leukopenic cats); positive result indicates active
infection in bone marrow that can usually be detected by 3 weeks post-infection but
may take up to 12 weeks to test positive; a positive result only indicates viral infec-
tion an not current illness, so it should be confirmed by another method and has no
bearing on prognosis.
■Vaccinates are not detected by either ELISA/ICGA or IFA.
■Discordant results
■ Two ELISA/ICGA tests differ: perform IFA
■ Positive ELISA/ICGA and IFA: suggests persistent viremia and true positive
■ Positive ELISA/ICGA and negative IFA: repeat assay in 6 to 8 weeks
■ PCR—detects viral RNA or DNA in blood, solid tissue, cell culture, or fixed samples;
requires special equipment and expertise; can help determine status of cats with
discordant ELISA/ICGA and IFA results or if suspicious of latent infections due to
chronic conditions.
Imaging
■ Thymic atrophy in fading kittens
Diagnostic Procedures
■  Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy—indicated if nonregenerative anemia is present;
rule out aplastic anemia versus anemia secondary to myeloproliferative disease.
Pathologic Findings
■ Lesions depend on concurrent disease state and presence of neoplasia.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Outpatient unless severe secondary infections or other conditions require hospital-
ization and further treatment
■ Supportive care as needed
FELINELEUKEMIAVIRUSINFECTION(FeLV)
253
Drug(s) of Choice
■Zidovudine (Retrovir, AZT) 5 mg/kg PO, SQ every 12 hours; antiviral, possible clini-
cal improvement but poor response in vivo than in cats infected with FIV; monitor
for nonregenerative anemia, reduce dose compared to FIV treatment, do not treat
cats with myelosuppression; other human antivirals are being studied but those with
efficacy in vivo often have severe toxicity or are ineffective.
 Interferon—immunomodulatory and direct antiviral effect—human IFNα (Roferon)
can be given for 6 to 7 weeks in high doses (10' to 10" IU/kg), after which neutral-
izing antibodies are generated. Oral administration (low dose: 15-30U orally every
24 hours for 7 days on alternate weeks) may stimulate lymphoid tissue in the oral
cavity with resulting systemic immunomodulation, but interferons are destroyed in
the gastrointestinal tract so no measurable serum levels develop.
protein A, Propionibacterium acnes, and paraimmunity inducers) have showed
equivocal results in clinical trials; nonspecific immune stimulation may increase
viral replication and promote progression of disease, therefore it may not be
recommended.
Anemia—-Blood transfusions may be necessary in severe anemia; suspect Mycoplasma
hemofelis (formerly Haemobartonella) in all cats with regenerative hemolytic anemia
    (   t      
treatment of stomatitis
 Lymphoma—standard chemotherapy protocols
 Myeloproliferative disease and leukemias—more refractory to treatment.
Contraindications
■ MLV vaccines may theoretically cause illness
Precautions/Interactions
 Systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs should be avoided
unless a very compelling indication exists.
1 Inactivated boosters to only core vaccines (RV and FRVCP) should be considered
for routine vaccination; cats who are positive for FeLV may not be able to mount
adequate immune response to rabies vaccination so more frequent boosters than
usually recommended (e.g., every 6 months) must be considered, especially in cats
allowed to go outside in areas with high rabies prevalence.
 Perioperative antibiotics are recommended for all surgeries and dental procedures.
Virus lives for only minutes outside the host and is susceptible to all disinfectants
(including common soap) so routine cleaning procedures will prevent transmission
in the hospital. Viremic cats should be kept away from sick cats to protect them from
infectious diseases, and under no circumstances should they be placed in an “isola-
tion ward" with cats suffering from infections such as viral respiratory disease.
Diet
■  Normal unless secondary conditions necessitate alternative foods
Surgical Considerations
■ No specific surgical treatments, surgical removal of tumors if present, treat oral
lesions appropriately.
■ Intact cats who are positive for FeLV should be spayed or neutered to reduce stress
associated with estrus/mating and decrease roaming and aggressive behaviors.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Emphasize the importance of keeping cats who are positive for FeLV indoors to
prevent spread of the virus and protect the positive cat from exposure to secondary
infections.
■Warn owners that adult cats who are negative for FeLV have a 10 to 15 percent risk of
infection if they have lived with a positive cat for several months. The negative cats
should receive FeLV vaccination if the owner refuses to separate the housemates.
■ Warn owners that cats who have FeLV may have a slower response to treatment of
secondary conditions.
Patient Monitoring
■ Biannual exams with CBC, oral examination, lymph node measurements, and body
weight are recommended to evaluate for secondary diseases and myelosuppression;
minimum annual chemistry profile and urinalysis should be performed, more fre-
quent monitoring may be warranted if concurrent diseases exist.
Prevention/Avoidance
■Prevent interaction with infected cats.
Quarantine and test new cats before introducing into multi-cat households/
catteries.
■Vaccine-test cats before initial vaccination and do not vaccinate cats who are posi-
tive for FeLV; warn owners that cat may be infected if testing is not performed;
efficacy controversial and none is lo0 percent effective; risk of vaccine associated
sarcomas with FeLV (and RV) vaccination is 0.1 to 0.ol percent overall, likely due
to adjuvant, vaccinate low on left hind leg per AAFP recommendations.
Possible Complications
■ Cats that are negative for FeLV that live with an infected cats have a fortyfold
increased risk of lymphoma compared with cats who live in households that are
negative for FeLV.

Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FiP)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 FIP, first discovered in the 1960s, is the term describing a complex systemic clinical
syndrome of domestic, and certain nondomestic, cats resulting from infection with
a virulent biotype of FCoV.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ The clinical syndrome called FIP is known to be caused by a virulent FCoV called
FIPV.
■ All FCoVs have the potential to cause FIP However, not all cats with FIPV infection
will develop clinical disease.
■
Genetic susceptibility among certain breeds (e.g., Persian), and lines within breeds.
 may influence whether or not clinical illness develops.
 The pathophysiology of FCoV infection, and subsequent development of FIP, is
complex and is not completely understood.
 FCoV infection occurs subsequent to fecal-oral transmission, commonly between a
queen and her kittens, especially through contaminated litter.
Infection via the respiratory tract has been suggested.
FCoV replication within intestinal epithelium is rapid; viral shedding can occur in
feces with 2 days of ingestion.
 FCoV infection may be subclinical (asymptomatic), may lead to diarrhea only or
may cause multisystemic disease.
 Most infections are subclinical.
 It is not possible to predict the outcome following infection.
 Multisystemic disease associated with FCoV infection is an immune-mediated disease
leading to widespread vasculitis, a characteristic lesion of FIP.
 Once systemic dissemination of virus occurs, either of two clinical variations, effusive
("wet") or noneffusive ("dry") FIP, may result.
■Effusive FIP usually develops within 4 to 8 weeks following infection and typically
develops in the peritoneal or pleural cavities. Effusion is the result of vasculitis, vessel
destruction and the formation of pyogranulomata.
257
258
■ Noneffusive FIP is a more chronic disease resulting from a partial cell-mediated
immune response; clinical signs manifest months or years following initial
infection.
■Why some cats never develop FIP following FCoV infection is not clear.
■ Protection is generally associated with CMl, while a systemic humoral immune
response is considered to be harmful or may predispose cats to severe disease fol-
lowing subsequent infection (antibody-dependent enhancement).
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■Transient vomiting or diarrhea may warrant veterinary attention during the earliest
stages of clinical FIP (coronaviral enteritis).
■ Although cats of any age may develop clinical FIP, about 50 percent are 2 years of
age or younger.
■A history of having been group-housed (i.e., shelter, breeding cattery, rescue group)
is common.
■ Cats with effusive FIP may present for a distended abdomen (abdominal cavity effu-
sion) or respiratory distress/tachypnea (thoracic cavity or pericardial effusion)
(Figure 35.1).

FELINE INFECTIOUS PERITONITIS (FIP)
259
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Risk of FIP is greatest among young cats (usually less than 2 years of age) housed
in multicat households.
 Certain breeds (e.g., Persian), and lines within breeds, appear to be more likely to
develop FIP subsequent to FCoV infection.
contributing to viral shedding and the signs of FIP in FCoV infected cats.
CLINICAL FEATURES
 Abdominal effusion (see Figure 35.1) or respiratory difficulty, associated with pleural
cavity effusion or pericarditis, are among the most common presenting clinical mani-
festations of effusive FIP.
 Other nonspecific signs may include pallor, icterus, lethargy, palpable abdominal
masses (adhesions or lymphadenomegaly), scrotal enlargement, and fever.
 Cats with noneffusive FIP typically present with vague clinical signs.
Abdominal palpation may reveal nodular irregularities on viscera or enlarged
lymph nodes.
■ Several ocular abnormalities have been described in cats with FIP including iritis
(color changes), anterior uveitis, keratic precipitates, and retinal detachment or
hemorrhage.
■ Neurologic signs are reported in 25 to 33 percent of cats with noneffusive FIP.
Nystagmus, ataxia, and seizures are among the most common neurologic signs
reported.
■ FIP is not a recognized cause of “fading kitten syndrome" (i.e., death occurring
between birth and weaning), but it is recognized as a cause of death among kittens
after weaning.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 The lack of specificity among the spectrum of clinical signs associated with FIP war-
rants testing any sick cat for FeLV antigen and FIV antibody.
■ Pregnancy, abdominal neoplasia (lymphoma), hepatic failure, and hydronephrosis
should be considered in cats presenting with abdominal distension.
 Cats presented with respiratory distress should be evaluated for cardiomyopathy
congestive heart failure, heartworm disease, pneumonia, lymphoma, and restrictive
pleuritis.

DIAGNOSTICS
■ Antemortem diagnosis of FIP, particularly noneffusive FIP, is difficult and requires
a comprehensive assessment of the patient's history, clinical signs, and laboratory
test results.
■ Besides histopathology, there is no single diagnostic test that can confirm a diagnosis
of FIP.
■ Hematology may reveal lymphopenia and neutrophilia with a left shift and mild.
nonregenerative anemia (hematocrit <30 percent).
highly suggestive of FIP in cats with associated clinical signs and is negative for
FeLV and FIV.
■ Approximately 75 percent of cats with noneffusive FIP have abnormal serum pro-
 teins, making this simple test an important diagnostic parameter.
■  In cats with effusive FIP, fluid analysis is extremely useful in establishing a clinical
diagnosis.
]
 Physical appearance of the fluid collected from the abdominal or thoracic cavities
reveals a viscous, yellow to straw-colored fluid that may form clots on standing
and froths when shaken, not stirred.
■ Cytological assessment reveals a relatively hypocellular fluid (<5000 cells/μL)
consisting of neutrophils and macrophages (pyogranulomatous fluid) that is
absent of bacteria or neoplastic cells (Figure 35.2).
■ Additionally, effusion with a high total protein (>3.5 g/dL) or an albumin-to-
globulin ratio <0.45 is highly supportive of FIP.

macrophages
FELINE INFECTIOUS PERITONITIS (FIP)  261
1Advanced diagnostics
1 Serologic testing for FCoV antibody is commonly used in practice, however this
test is neither a consistent nor reliable indicator of FIP and should not be used as
a single source diagnostic test.
 Virus isolation from effusions of cats with FiP rarely yields positive results and
as such, availability is limited.
■ rtPCR has been successful in confirming the presence of FCoV in seronegative
cats and detecting FCoV shedding. While this test is reported to have good
sensitivity and specificity, rtPCR for FCoV does not specifically identify FIPV
the cause of FIP, and a positive test does not predict impending FIP in a
healthy cat.
■ Recently, a commercially available rtPCR test for the detection of FCoV mRNA
in circulating macrophages has become available (See www.vetmed.auburn.edu/
index.pl/feline_infectious_peritonitis_virus for more information). The test is
based on the fact that although avirulent FCoV can be found in peripheral blood.
replication within macrophages, and expression of mRNA, is unique to FIPV.
Screening Healthy Cats
■ Veterinarians may be requested to screen healthy cats for evidence of FIP. In such
cases, it is reasonable to submit serum for FCoV antibody. Cats with a negative titer
(usually less than 1:10 or 1: 20) are unlikely to have been exposed to FCoV and are
therefore acceptable candidates for use in breeding programs. However, the clinician
must use a reliable laboratory that will perform titers to this level.
Pathological Findings
■Histopathology is the diagnostic test of choice in confirming FIP wherein pyogranu-
loma is the defining lesion. Kidney, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes are repre-
sentative tissues likely to be affected in cats with FIP (Figure 35.3). Vasculitis is
characteristically seen in the microvasculature of affected tissues.
 Pyogranulomatous mass lesions in the ileocecal colic junction have been reported in
cats.
THERAPEUTICS
■  In the absence of FCoV antiviral therapy, treatment centers on management of
immune-mediated injury through judicious use of prednisolone (2-4 mg/kg per day
PO once daily or divided into two doses; the dose can be reduced empirically every
10 to 14 days until an optimal response is achieved). Cats with FIP are expected to
succumb from complications associated with the infection. Concurrent administra-
tion of antibiotics is indicated
 Recombinant human IFN has been used in the United States as adjunctive therapy
for cats with FIP. Because cats develop anti-IFN antibody, use of human IFN to treat

culitis, is present over the surface of the kidney.
FIP is no longer recommended. Recently, recombinant feline IFN-omega (currently
not available in the United States) has been used concurrently with prednisolone to
treat cats with FIP. However, benefits of supplemental IFN, without prednisolone.
have not been established.
■ Vitamins (Bi [thiamine], B-complex, C [ascorbic acid], and E) as well as anabolic
steroids and thromboxane synthetase inhibitors have been administered empirically
as supportive treatment of cats with FIP. The clinical benefits associated with these
products have not been defined.
Prognosis
■ The prognosis of any kitten or cat with a confirmed diagnosis of FIP is poor.
■Cats with effusive FIP are not likely to live beyond a few weeks.
■ Noneffusive FIP, however, is a more chronic clinical disease; with supportive treat-
ment, affected cats may live for several months or years.
■ Cats with neurologic disease caused by FIPV have a grave prognosis and are only
expected to survive for days to weeks despite treatment.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Beyond the prognosis, owners of cats with FIP who have additional, healthy cats in
the household should be advised of the following:
FELINE INFECTIOUS PERITONITIS (FIP)  263
1. Most cats that have been exposed to FCoV are likely to seroconvert within
18 to 2l days; however, a “positive” FCoV antibody titer does not define
infection.
2. FCoV infection is common among group-housed cats but is not synonymous with
FIP nor is it predictive of impending FIP.
3. Although FCoV is directly transmitted to cats, FIPV, the cause of FIP, is not gen-
erally considered to be a contagious virus.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Prevention of FIP centers on limiting exposure to FCoV particularly among
kittens.
 In breeding catteries, early weaning (by 5 weeks of age) and physical separation of
kittens from adults (and their litter trays) have shown to be effective measures in
limiting FCoV infection, and subsequent development of FIP, in kittens housed in
multicat households.
■  Immunization of susceptible cats and kittens against FIP has proved to be difficult.
To date, only one vaccine has been licensed as an aid in the prevention of FIP. The
vaccine is a modified-live virus approved for intranasal administration only. Although
the vaccine is generally regarded as safe, efficacy has not been definitively demon-
strated in field studies.
■ Current feline vaccine guidelines stipulate that the FIP vaccine is “not generally
recommended" on the basis that the vaccine has not been shown to consistently
induce protective immunity.

Feline Immunodeficiency
Virus (FIV)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 A retrovirus (genus Lentivirus) infection that causes immune suppression in domestic
cats; same genus as HIV, the causative agent of AIDS in humans.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Progressive disruption of normal immune function but otherwise not completely
understood.
■ Five viral subtypes (A, B, C, D, and E) that determine cell tropism and influence
pathogenicity.
■ Replicates in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, macrophages, astrocytes,
and microglia cells.
■  Three clinical stages generally described: Acute—-virus spreads from inoculation site
 to lymph tissues and thymus; clinically asymptomatic
-duration varies but can last
for years, depends on the pathogenicity of the infecting isolate and exposure to other
pathogens; terminal (also called feline AIDS)—clinical signs reflect secondary infec-
tions, neoplasia, myelosuppression, and neurologic disease.
■Cell-mediated immunity—Over time there are changes in the CD4-to-CD8 cell ratio;
initially CD4+ is suppressed, the immune response causes a rebound in CD8+ greater
than preinfection levels, then over time both decrease.
Humoral immunity—effected in terminal stages.
■
 Concurrent FeLV infection may increase pathogenicity of FIV.
Systems Affected
■ Hemic/Lymphatic/Immune—Suppression of CD4+ and eventually CD8+T cells
■]
RenalUrologicNephropathy
■ Nervous—Behavioral changes, peripheral neuropathies, changes in normal sleep
patterns, or seizures
■ Other body systems—Secondary to immune suppression and secondary infections
265

BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Incidence/Prevalence
■ United States and Canada—2 to 5 percent in healthy cat population; 4 to 24 percent
 in sick cats or cats with high risk (feral or free-roaming: male)
Geographic Distribution
■ Worldwide; seroprevalence varies greatly and subtypes may be different in any given
region.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Species
■Cats
Mean Age and Range
■Prevalence increases with age at infection.
Predominant Sex
■ Male two to four times more likely than females; demonstrate more aggression and
roaming behaviors
General Comments
■ Most often associated with immunosuppression and secondary infections
■  FIV-induced immunodeficiency is clinically indistinguishable from that induced by
FeLV.
Historical Findings
■Many are healthy; others have recurrent mild illness, particularly gastrointestinal or
upper respiratory signs.
Physical Examination Findings
■  May vary greatly depending on secondary infections
■ Lymphadenopathy—mild to moderate
Oral—gingivitis, stomatitis up to 50 percent of cases especially with concurrent
calicivirus infection, periodontitis, or resorptive lesions
■ Ocular—anterior uveitis (especially if concurrent I. gondii infection), pars planitis,
conjunctivitis, glaucoma, chorioretinitis, retinal degeneration, and hemorrhages
■  Integument—chronic recurrent skin or ear infections, bacterial, or fungal
■ Upper respiratory tract—rhinitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis; often secondary concur-
rent herpes virus, calicivirus, or I. gondii infections
FELINE IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (FIV) 
 Gastrointestinalchronic diarrhea or primary inflammatory or secondary infectious
(i.e., bacterial, fungal, or parasitic)
■ Cachexia and fever, especially in terminal stages
 Neurologic-—central and peripheral, in about 5 percent of cases, behavioral changes,
changes in normal sleep patterns, peripheral neuropathies, or seizures
Neoplasia—lymphoma (five times more likely than noninfected cats, mainly B cell)
or other neoplasia
Risk Factors/Causes
■Feral or free-roaming cats
■ Male
Sexually intact
■]
Horizontal transmission via saliva or blood, usually by biting
  Vertical transplacental or transmammary transmission possible in vitro, rarely in vivo
7
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Primary infections—viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic
 Toxoplasmosis—neurologic, ocular signs
■ Neoplasia of nonviral origin
DIAGNOSTICS
Completed Blood Count/Chemistry/Urinalysis
■ Hemogram—may be normal; lymphopenia, anemia, or neutropenia; neutrophilia
may be present with secondary infections
 Serum chemistry profile and urinalysis—hyperproteinemia from hypergammaglobu-
linemia, otherwise typically normal unless secondary infections are present
Other Laboratory Tests
■Serologic testing
■ Detects antibodies to FIV, seroconversion takes up to l2 weeks; antigen levels too
low to detect.
■ ELISA—in-house and diagnostic laboratory tests are available for routine screen-
ing. False-positives and false-negatives are possible. Confirm all positive tests with
western blot, especially in low-risk, healthy cats or if diagnosis will result in
euthanasia.
■ Western (immuno) blot—used to confirm positive ELISA tests
 Kittens <6 months old may test positive due to the presence of maternal antibod-
ies, retest at 8 to 12 months.
■Others:
■ Virus isolation—expensive, time consuming, requires expertise, making it imprac-
tical for routine diagnosis
■  PCR—assays available in the United States vary significantly in accuracy and are
not reliable in differentiating vaccinates from infected cats. Sensitivity ranged from
and 44 to 95 percent in cats vaccinated against FIV. Correct results were obtained
in 58 to 90 percent of the 124 cats tested. All tests misidentified uninfected and
infected cats. False-positive results by all laboratories were higher in cats vacci-
nated against FIV than in unvaccinated cats.
■ CD4+-to-CD8t evaluation via flow cytometry can help to establish the extent of
immunosuppression but is not diagnostic.
Pathologic Findings
■ Lymphadenopathy—follicular hyperplasia and severe plasmacyte infiltration pro-
gressing to follicular involution as the disease progresses
■ Lymphocytic plasmacytic infiltration in lymphoid tissues and other major organs
(i.e., liver, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, and brain)
■ Perivascular cuffing in muscle and brain, gliosis, neuronal loss, and reorganization
■  Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis characteristic of lentiviral infections in other
species
■ Bone marrow dysplasia, granulocytic hyperplasia, or marrow lymphoid aggregates
■ Gastrointestinal inflammation, villous blunting, or pyogranulomatous colitis, similar
 to panleukopenia
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of choice
■ Zidovudine (Retrovir, AZT) 5 to 10 mg/kg PO, SC every 12 hours, antiviral, monitor
for nonregenerative anemia, virus can become resistant, reduce dose in cats with
renal disease, do not treat cats with myelosuppression.
 IFN—immunomodulatory and direct antiviral effect—human IFNα (Roferon) can
be given for 6 to 7 weeks in high doses (l0" to l0'1U/k) parenterally, after which
neutralizing antibodies are generated. Oral administration (low dose: l-5oIU/kg
every 24 hours) may stimulate lymphoid tissue in the oral cavity with resulting
systemic immunomodulation, but INFs are destroyed in the gastrointestinal tract so
no measurable serum levels develop.
■IGF—increases thymus size and T lymphocyte population in experimentally infected
cats; no documented studies currently in naturally infected cats.
■ Antibacterial and antifungal drugs as needed for secondary infections
        
or oxazepam (Serax) 2.5mg/cat PO; for more prolonged appetite stimulation:
FELINE IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (FV)269
Mirtazapine (Remeron) 3.75 mg/cat PO every 3 days; anabolic steroids or megestrol
in cats who are positive FIV unknown.
■ Ocular manifestations such as glaucoma should be treated appropriately with stan-
dard therapies; anterior uveitis may be poorly responsive in the long term; Pars
planitis often spontaneously resolves but may recur.
 Anemia—if underlying cause is not found, EPO may be used, 100 IU/kg SQ every
other day until desired HCT is reached, then as needed to maintain the HCT.
 Oral lesions may be refractory to medical management, repeated dental prophylaxis
and antibiotics may be palliative, and full-mouth extractions, including all roots, can
help alleviate lesions. Avoid glucocorticoids in FIV-related stomatitis. AZT or topical
bovine lactoferrin (40 mg/kg every 24 hours as needed) may be helpful.
Contraindications
■Griseofulvin can cause severe neutropenia allowing life-threatening secondary infec-
tions in cats who are positive for FIV
■ MLV may cause illness
■ Recombinant rHuG-CSF is contraindicated in neutropenic cats who are positive for
FIV as it can increase viral load.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs should be avoided
unless a very compelling indication exists.
tion and antigenic stimulation may promote viral production, negating the advantage
of preventing secondary infections. If cats who are positive for FIV are kept strictly
indoors, the risk of secondary infections may be lower than the possible harmful
effect of vaccination. Legal requirements for rabies vaccination may supersede these
issues.
 Perioperative antibiotics are recommended for all surgeries and dental procedures
 The virus lives for only minutes outside the host and is susceptible to all disinfectants
(including common soap) so routine cleaning procedures will prevent transmission
in the hospital. Viremic cats should be kept away from sick cats to protect them from
infectious diseases, and under no circumstances should they be placed in an "isola-
tion ward" with cats suffering from infections such as viral respiratory disease.
Alternative Drugs
Immunomodulatory  therapy—nonspecific agents (Acemannan, Staphylococcus
protein A, Propionibacterium acnes, paramunity inducer) may relieve clinical signs in
symptomatic cats, but nonspecific immune stimulation may increase viral replication
and promote progression of disease, therefore may not be recommended.
Diet
■  Normal unless secondary conditions necessitate alternative foods.
Surgical Considerations
■ No specific surgical treatments; surgical removal of tumors if present, treating oral
lesions appropriately.
■ Intact FIV positive cats should be spayed/neutered to reduce stress associated with
 estrus/mating and decrease roaming and aggressive behaviors.
Appropriate Health Care
■ Outpatient unless severe secondary infections require hospitalization and further
treatment.
Nursing Care
■ Appropriate for secondary infections and supportive care as needed.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Educate client on course of disease including possibility of long-term good health
and chronicity of illness if symptomatic.
■  Emphasize the importance of keeping antibody positive cats, as well as negative cats
in the household, indoors to prevent spread of the virus and protect the positive cats
 from exposure to secondary infections.
Patient Monitoring
■ Biannual exams with CBC are recommended to evaluate for secondary diseases and
myelosuppression, more frequent monitoring may be warranted if concurrent dis-
eases exist.
Prevention/Avoidance
 Prevent interaction with infected cats.
Quarantine and test new cats before introducing into multicat households/catteries
Transmission within stable social environments is rare.
Possible Complications
■ Immunosuppression
Recurrent bacterial or viral infections
■ Neurologic disease including seizures
FELINE IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (FIV)
271
■Neoplasia
■Death
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Acute phase lasts several days to weeks, asymptomatic phase variable but may last
many years, death occurring in about 18 percent of infected cats within the first 2
years (approximately 5 years after estimated time of infection). Length of terminal
phase is often related to secondary infections, neoplasia, myelosuppression, and
neurologic disease.
Vaccine
■ Dual Subtype (A&D), inactivated adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (Fel-O-Vax FIV,
Fort Dodge Animal Health)
 Vaccinates are indistinguishable from infected cats by current testing methods
Associated Conditions
 Secondary infections
■ Neoplasia—Especially lymphoid, also SCC, and others
■ Age-related factors—Kittens may test positive due to maternal antibodies (viral or
vaccinal).
■ Potential transmission of secondary infections (e.g., I. gondii) to immunocompro-
mised people
Pregnancy
 Transplacental and transmammary transmission is rare, but infected queen could
infect kittens by biting umbilical cord or grooming kittens.

Feline Lower Urinary Tract
Disease (FLUTD)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ In approximately 65 percent of nonobstructed male and female cats with naturally
occurring lower urinary tract disease, the exact cause(s) of hematuria, dysuria, pol-
lakiuria, stranguria, and periuria are still unknown. After appropriate diagnostic
evaluations, these cats are classified as having feline iLUTD or feline idiopathic
cystitis.
1  Feline iLUTD is an exclusionary diagnosis established only after known causes have
been eliminated.
■ Some cats with iLUTD exhibit findings similar to those observed in humans with
interstitial cystitis, an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of the urinary bladder. These
similarities have prompted the hypothesis that some cases of feline iLUTD are analo-
gous to human interstitial cystitis; further studies are essential to prove or disprove
this hypothesis.
 The terms feline urological syndrome and FUs have been commonly used to describe
disorders of cats characterized by hematuria, dysuria, pollakiuria, stranguria, and
partial or complete obstruction. Because these signs may be associated with any cause
of lower urinary tract disease, these terms should be abandoned and replaced with
more descriptive terminology pertaining to site of injury, cause(s), morphologic
changes, or pathophysiologic mechanisms.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Exact etiology(ies) are unknown, likely multifactorial.
Quantitative or qualitative defects in surface GAGs and subsequent increased uro-
thelial permeability have been hypothesized to be a causative factor.
 Stress may play a role in precipitating or exacerbating signs; neuroendocrine abnor-
malities identified in cats with chronic forms of iLUTD are indicative of increased
activity  of  the sympathetic nervous system  and diminished adrenocortical
responsiveness.
  Experimental and clinical studies have implicated feline calicivirus as a potential
etiological agent.
273
274
Systems Affected
Renal/Urologic
■ Persistent urethral outflow obstruction results in postrenal azotemia.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■Both males and females are affected.
■ No breed predilection
■ May occur at any age, but is most commonly recognized in young to middle aged
adults (mean age 4.4 years)
 Uncommon in cats <1l year old and >10 years old
■
 No known genetic basis
■Common clinical signs include pollakiuria, hematuria, stranguria, periuria (urination
in inappropriate locations), dysuria, and urethral outflow obstruction.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Stress-may play a role in precipitating or exacerbating signs; an unlikely primary
cause
Sex—males and female affected equally; however, neutered males and spayed females
are at increased risk compared to intact animals.
Historical Findings
■Pollakiuria
Hematuria
■Dysuria
■Stranguria
■  Periuria—-urinating in inappropriate locations
■Urinary outflow obstruction
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Periuria, pollakiuria, stranguria, and gross hematuria are the most common clinical
signs observed in cats with nonobstructive idiopathic cystitis.
■ Clinical signs subside within 5 to 7 days without therapy in up to 92 percent of cats
with acute nonobstructive idiopathic cystitis.
■ Signs may recur after variable periods of time and again subside without treatment.
Approximately 40 to 50 percent of cats with acute idiopathic cystitis will experience
one or more recurrences of signs within 1 to 2 years.
 Recurrent episodes of acute idiopathic cystitis tend to decrease in frequency and
severity as the cats become older.
recurrence of the original disease; however, recurrent signs may also be the result of
a delayed manifestation of the original disease (e.g., spontaneous or iatrogenic ure-
thral stricture), or onset of a different lower urinary tract disease associated with
similar clinical signs (e.g., urolithiasis).
■ A small subset of cats with iLUTD have persistent clinical signs that last for weeks
to months or are frequently recurrent. These cats are classified as having iLUTD.
Less than 15 percent of cats evaluated because of acute idiopathic cystitis will develop
chronic forms of the disease.
■Physical examination—may reveal a thickened, firm, contracted, painful, bladder
wall; may detect urethral plugs or uroliths by examination of the distal penis and
penile urethra.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Metabolic disorders including various types of uroliths and urethral plugs.
■ Infectious agents including bacteria, fungal agents, and parasites.
■Trauma
■ Neurogenic disorders including reflex dyssynergia, urethral spasm, and hypotonic
or atonic bladder (primary or secondary).
 latrogenic diseases including those due to urethral catheters, indwelling urethral
catheters (especially open systems). postsurgical catheters, reverse-flushing solu-
tions, and urethrostomy complications.
■ Anatomic  abnormalities  including urachal anomalies  and  acquired urethral
strictures.
 Neoplasia (benign and malignant).
■Behavioral disorders resulting in periuria.
 Clinical signs may be confused with constipation.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ No single test is diagnostic; feline iLUTD is an exclusionary diagnosis established
only after known causes have been eliminated.
 Hematuria and proteinuria are common urinalysis findings. Initial episodes of iLUTD
usually occur in the absence of pyuria and significant numbers of detectable
bacteria.
 Quantitative urine cultureverifies absence of bacteriuria and excludes urinary tract
infection; light microscopic examination of urine sediment is an unreliable method
of detecting bacteriuria; collect urine specimens by cystocentesis to avoid contamina-
tion with organisms that normally inhabit the distal urethra
■  Survey radiography—may exclude uroliths or urethral plugs
■ Positive-contrast retrograde urethrocystography or antegrade cystography—may
exclude urethral strictures, vesicourachal diverticula, and neoplasia.
■ Double-contrast cystography—may exclude small or radiolucent uroliths, blood
clots, and thickening of the bladder wall due to inflammation or neoplasia.
■ Ultrasonography--may exclude uroliths in the urinary bladder.
merulations) on the surface of the urinary bladder; may exclude urethral strictures.
ureteroliths, urocystoliths, blood clots, vesicourachal diverticula, and neoplasia.
■ Biopsies obtained with urinary catheters, cystoscopes, or via surgery—may permit
morphologic characterization of the inflammatory or neoplastic lesions; not routinely
needed.
Pathologic Findings
■ Mucosal ulceration and submucosal edema, hemorrhage, fibrosis, neovasculariza-
tion, mastocytosis, and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration are common light
microscopic lesions observed in the urinary bladders of cats with chronic iLUTD.
■ Inflammatory cells may not be prominent in some forms of the disease, unless sec-
ondary bacterial infections have resulted  from catheterization  or perineal
urethrostomy.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Patients with nonobstructive lower urinary tract disease—-typically managed as out-
patients; diagnostic evaluation may require brief hospitalization
■ Patients with obstructive lower urinary tract disease—-usually hospitalized for diag-
nosis and management
■ Short-term use of pharmacologic agents is considered for any patient with severe
signs.
  Long-term dietary and environment management strategies are used to minimize the
risk of recurrences.
■ Long-term pharmacologic inventions are usually reserved for cats with more
severe chronic forms of the disease in which dietary and environmental management
          s
recurrences
■ Over 70 agents or procedures have been recommended for management of nonob-
structive iLUTD in cats; fewer than 10 percent of these proposed treatments have
been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Debate surrounding the efficacy of various
treatments is complicated by the self-limiting nature of clinical signs associated with
the majority of cases of idiopathic cystitis. In this setting. any form of therapy might
appear to be beneficial as long as it is not harmful.
Drug(s) of choice
Anti-lnflammatory Agents and Analgesics
of benefit in alleviating acute “flare-ups" of severe pollakiuria, dysuria, stranguria,
and periuria in affected cats; butorphanol 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg every 8 hours, PO for 1
to 3 days; buprenorphine 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg every 6 to 12 hours, IM or SQ, buccally
for l to 3 days. There have been no reports of controlled studies evaluating the
efficacy and safety of short-term opioid analgesics for management of cats with
idiopathic cystitis.
1 Corticosteroids—no detectable effect on remission of clinical signs in cats demon-
strated in controlled clinical trial; predispose to bacterial urinary tract infections.
especially in cats with indwelling transurethral catheters.
■ NSAIDs—safety and efficacy of NSAIDs in the treatment of cats with iLUTD have
not been evaluated by controlled clinical trials. Pending further safety and efficacy
studies, use appropriate caution when considering use of NSAIDs to treat feline
idiopathic cystitis.
Amitriptyline and Other Antidepressants
■Amitriptyline—a tricyclic antidepressant and anxiolytic drug (with anticholinergic.
antihistaminic, antiα-adrenergic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties)
reserved for treatment of cats with severe chronic iLUTD who have not responded
to other forms of pharmacologic, dietary, and environmental management; sug-
gested empirical dosage is 5 to 10mg/cat every 24 hours given at night; may
predispose to urine retention, bacterial urinary tract infection, and urolithiasis.
We do not recommend amitriptyline for treatment of acute self-limiting episodes of
iLUTD.
■ Efficacy and safety of other tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, and anxiolytics have not been evaluated by controlled clinical trials.
Glycosaminoglycans
  Pentosan polysulfate sodium—a semi-synthetic low molecular weight heparin ana-
logue that reinforces urothelial GAGs and reduces transitional cell injury. Oral
pentosan polysulfate 50 mg every 12 hours PO may benefit some cats with chronic
iLUTD. Results of controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of
pentosan polysulfate have not been reported.
■ Glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate—glucosamine, an amino sugar naturally produced
in the body, is an important intermediate for the formation of GAGs. Chondroitin
sulfate is one of the most abundant GAGs in the bladder surface GAG layer. No
           
glucosamine and those treated with a placebo. The efficacy of oral glucosamine
combined with chondroitin sulfate has not been evaluated by controlled clinical
trials.
Anticholinergics

in rate of recovery was observed between cats treated with propantheline and control
groups.
■ Oxybutynin chloride—a moderately potent anticholinergic agent with additional
independent musculotropic relaxant and local anesthetic effects; efficacy of oxybu-
tynin has not been evaluated by controlled clinical trials.

General
 Feline facial pheromone fraction F3—no detectable effect on remission of clinical
signs in cats demonstrated in controlled clinical trial.
■ Antimicrobials—no detectable effect on remission of clinical signs in cats demon-
strated in controlled clinical trial.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Cats with urethral obstruction and postrenal azotemia are at increased risk for
adverse drug events, especially with drugs and anesthetics that depend on renal
elimination or metabolism.
  Indwelling urethral catheters, especially when associated with fluid-induced diuresis
or coadministration of corticosteroids, predispose patients to bacterial urinary tract
infections.
■  Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g.. amitriptyline)—avoid short-term administration or
abrupt discontinuation
■Coadministration of oxybutynin or tolterodine with other anticholinergic agents
(e.g., amitriptyline)—may intensify adverse effects and should be avoided
■  Phenazopyridine—a urinary tract analgesic; may result in methemoglobinemia and
Heinz body anemia
■Methylene blue—a weak antiseptic agent; may result in Heinz body anemia
Diet
■ Results of a nonrandomized, open, prospective study suggest that feeding moist
rather than dry foods may minimize recurrence of signs.
 Management recommended for persistent crystalluria in patients at risk for formation
of crystalline-matrix urethral plugs
Surgical Considerations
■ Cystotomy to obtain biopsy specimens in patients with clinical finding consistent
with iLUTD is not recommended.
FELINE LOWER URINARY TRACT DISEASE (FLUTD)
Cystotomy to lavage and debride the bladder mucosa as a form of treatment is not
recommended.
■ Do not perform perineal urethrostomies to minimize recurrent urethral obstruction
without localizing obstructive disease to the penile urethra by contrast
radiography.
COMMENTS
Client Educations
Hematuria, dysuria, and pollakiuria—often self-limiting: subside within 5 to 7 days.
but signs may recur unpredictably in approximately one-half of affected cats
■ Lack of controlled studies that demonstrate efficacy of most drugs used to treat
symptomatically
■ Recurrent episodes of acute iLUTD tend to decrease in frequency and severity as the
cats become older.
Patient Monitoring
■ Males should be monitored for signs of urethral obstruction.
Prevention/Avoidance
■Feed moist diets
■ Reduce environmental stress by minimizing changes in the home, maintaining a
constant diet, providing opportunities for play and safe places to hide, refining cat-
owner interactions, and managing conflict between cats
Possible Complications
■ Urethral obstruction due to formation of urethral plugs-most common in male cats
with concurrent crystalluria
■ Vesicourachal diverticula—acquired vesicourachal diverticula often are self-liming
with resolution of clinical signs.
■  Indwelling transurethral catheters
often cause trauma; predispose to ascending
bacterial urinary tract infections
 Perineal urethrostomies-may predispose to ascending bacterial urinary tract infec-
tions and urethral strictures
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Hematuria, pollakiuria, and dysuria often are self-liming in patients with most
iLUTDs, subsiding within 5 to 7 days.
■ Signs will recur unpredictably in approximately half of affected cats; the frequency
of recurrence declines with advancing age.

Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus
(GDV) Syndrome
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
GDV syndrome starts as a rotation of the stomach along its long axis that causes
intragastric accumulation of gas.
GDV results in a variety of life-threatening conditions that can include circulatory
shock and SIRS.
■ If left untreated, GDV leads to death.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Severe gastric distention causes significant intraperitoneal pressure elevation, obstruc-
tion of the compliant caudal vena cava, decreased venous return and cardiac output,
hypoxemia, microcirculatory injury and maldistribution of blood flow.
 Cytokine production, cellular dysfunction, and reperfusion injury following resus-
citation can induce the SIRS and DIC. These consequences can culminate in multi-
organ failure and death.
Systems Affected
Cardiovascular
■ Translocation of fluid into the stomach and hemorrhage from rupture of the short
gastric and epiploic vessels can cause significant hypovolemia.
Hypoxemia, electrolyte disturbances, acid-base imbalances, and release of inflamma-
tory cytokines and myocardial depressant factors can result in myocardial dysrhyth-
mias (e.g., ventricular premature contractions).
 Pain is considerable; the sympathetic response can contribute to cardiovascular
compromise; gastric distension and compression of the caudal vena cava can result
in decreased return of blood to the right-sided heart, which ultimately results in
decreased cardiac preload, stroke volume, cardiac output, and hypotension.
Gastrointestinal
and ischemia.
281
■  Increased intraperitoneal pressure and decreased cardiac output reduces splanchnic
blood flow
Hemic/Lymphatic/lmmune
■ Bacterial endotoxin translocation through the disabled Gl mucosal barrier into the
lymphatics and bloodstream is expected.
■ As the stomach rotates, it can pull at the short gastric vessels, cause a splenic torsion,
or splenic ischemia or thrombosis.
Hepatobiliary
■ Because the liver may be compromised from venous congestion and circulatory
shock, bacteria may not be removed from the portal system, and can result in
septicemia.
Respiratory
result in aspiration pneumonia.
  Decreased thoracic capacity from gastric distension and diaphragmatic compression
can lead to hypoventilation and hypoxia.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Risk Factors/Causes
■ GDV can occur in any breed or species of animal, although it is most commonly
Dane, Gordon and Irish setter, Weimeraner, standard poodle, basset hound, and
Saint Bernard)
■ Other characteristics that are associated with GDV include having a first-degree rela-
tive that suffered GDV and owner's perception of high-level stress in the dog.
■ Additional factors thought to influence the formation of GDV include lean body
condition, increasing age, large sudden drops in environmental temperature, feeding
single large meals, overeating, small kibble size, elevated feeding bowls, postprandial
exercise, anesthesia, and aerophagia.
■The addition of table food or canned food to the diet of large and giant breed dogs
has been associated with a decreased incidence of GDV
Historical Findings
■ Common presenting complaints include "vomiting" or dry heaves and description
 of nonproductive retching, restlessness, increased salivation, and abdominal
distension.
■ Occasionally straining to defecate or stretching will be described.

■Megaesophagus
■ Infectious tracheobronchitis
DIAGNOSTICS
Physical Examination
The physical examination findings that lead to a suspicion of GDV are listed in the
clinical features.
Radiographs
A right lateral abdominal radiograph is usually the most diagnostic view for confirm-
ing the diagnosis (Figure 38.l). Typical radiographic signs include gas- or fluid-
dilated stomach and displacement of the pylorus in a dorsocranial position causing
compartmentalization or "Popeye arm" or “Smurf hat."
 Occasionally a left lateral or dorsoventral abdominal radiograph is also needed.
 Ventrodorsal radiographs are not recommended because positioning can place extra
pressure on the vena cava and additional compromise in venous return.
 The presence of gas within the gastric wall on radiographs may be observed when
significant necrosis is present.

Laboratory Analyses
      o sa pd    
evaluated and abnormalities immediately addressed.
■ Because GDV is considered an emergency surgical procedure, preanesthetic labora-
tory analyses that include a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and
 prothrombin/activated partial thromboplastin times are indicated.
Cardiovascular Monitoring
■ An electrocardiogram and blood pressure should be immediately evaluated at the
time of presentation.
■  It is not unexpected to discover a ventricular dysrhythmia caused by myocardial
hypoxia and circulating cytokines (Figure 38.2).
■ Hypertension is also not uncommon and usually corrects with fluid resuscitation and
analgesia.
GASTRIC DILATATION-VOLVULUS (GDV) SYNDROME
285
■ When hypotension or bradycardia exists, severe to catastrophic shock may be
occurring.
Pathological Findings
■ Anemia and hypoproteinemia can occur with hemorrhage and blood loss into the
damaged Gl tract.
■  Lactate level > 6.0 mmol/dL is a positive predictor of gastric necrosis and outcome.
■ Thrombocytopenia and prolonged ACT, prothrombin time, and activated partial
thromboplastin time are not unexpected and can be caused by consumption from
evidence of hemorrhage requires careful hemostasis during surgery and judicious
use of synthetic colloids.
Ventricular dysrhythmias can occur pre-, intra-, and postoperatively.
■  Esophageal dilation is also a reversible problem that usually corrects spontaneously
after gastric repositioning.
 Surgical Findings
■  Gastric rotation can occur in any direction.
■ Most commonly, however, it rotates l80 to 270 degrees in a clockwise direction (as
viewed from the caudal aspect of the patient when it is in dorsal recumbency).
 The pylorus initially moves ventral and to the left and ultimately rests in the dorsal
left quadrant of the abdomen.
Various degrees of gastric injury will be encountered, but most commonly, the cardia,
up to the esophageal hiatus, and the greater curvature of the fundus of the stomach
are affected.
■ Changes can be minor, with only mild hyperemia seen, or major with black and
ischemic gastric wall seen at the time of surgery.
 Peritoneal hemorrhage will most commonly occur from torn gastroepiploic and short
gastric vessels.
 Additional intraoperative findings can include splenic enlargement or torsion, and
pancreatic edema.
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
Balanced Analgesia
■ Pure μ-agonist opioids (such as fentanyl 5μg/kg IV followed by a continuous infu-
sion of 3-5μg/kg per hour) are given with a benzodiazepine (such as midazolam or
diazepam, 0.2 mg/kg IV).
■ When possible, avoid opioids known to induce vomiting (i.e., morphine,
hydromorphone)
■ Lidocaine (1-4 mg/kg bolus, followed by 50-100 μg/kg per hour or 300 mg in 1 litei
isotonic saline set at 2 ml/kg per hour) is used as an adjunctive analgesic or if a sig-
nificant ventricular dysrhythmia develops.
 Opioids and lidocaine can be mixed in the same fluid bag for continuous infusion.
Antibiotics
  Perioperative broad-spectrum antibiotics such as a first-generation cephalosporin or
ampicillin (20 mg/kg IV) should be administered.
■ Based on the findings at the time of surgery, additional antibiotics are selected based
on the need for anaerobes or resistant gram-negative coverage but are rarely required.
Gastric Decompression
Percutaneous Decompression/Trocarization
■ If the stomach can be percussed behind the ribs, it should be decompressed.
■ Percutaneous decompression is less stressful, less painful, and requires minimal
assistance compared with orogastric intubation and decompression.
■ Percutaneous decompression should be performed by clipping the fur over the most
tympanic part of the abdomen. Next the clipped area should be aseptically scrubbed,
then a large-bore (14--16-gauge) over-the-needle catheter inserted into the region
percutaneously. Once fluid and gas stop draining, remove the catheter.
Orogastric Intubation
 Orogastric intubation can also be performed with either sedation or general
anesthesia.
■ To perform orogastric intubation, measure an orogastric tube from the tip of the
nose to the last rib (Figure 38.3). Mark the tube, then lubricate it with sterile lubri-
cant. Place a roll of 2-inch white tape (or mouth gag in an anesthetized animal) in
the patient's mouth (Figure 38.4) and insert the tube through the roll of tape, to
prevent the animal clamping down on the tube. Slowly insert the tube until the distal
end of the tube enters the stomach. A rush of air and decompression of the abdominal
distension should occur. Do not force the tube, as perforation of the esophagus or
stomach can occur.
  d    r  n   
anesthesia is that a cuffed endotracheal tube inserted into the trachea can help to
prevent aspiration of gastric contents.
  Additionally, general anesthesia minimizes anxiety and patient discomfort associated
with the procedure.
■ For catastrophic cases that are dying before your eyes, or when immediate surgery
is not possible, nasogastric intubation can be attempted.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are not used in patients with GDV because
of potential adverse effects to the Gl tract
■ Figure 38.3 Measurement of an orogastric tube from the tip of the nose to the last rib prior to
placement.
 Figure 38.4 Place the orogastric tube through a roll of 2-inch tape and secure tape around the muzzle to

287
■ Corticosteroids have not been shown to reduce morbidity or mortality in the patient
with GDV and may increase risk of Gl ulceration and sepsis
Surgical Considerations
■ The stomach usually does not return to normal position without surgery, and the
degree of gastric necrosis cannot be determined medically.
■ The risk of reoccurrence of GDV without gastropexy is 54 to 76 percent.
■ Emergency surgery is recommended to return the stomach to normal position,
remove necrotic or ischemic gastric or splenic tissue, and pexy the stomach to the
 peritoneal wall.
■ When possible, surgical preparation of the abdomen, ventral thorax, and inguinal
area should be performed before anesthesia, to minimize anesthetic time.
■ Also clip the lateral abdomen for possible gastrostomy or jejunostomy feeding tube
placement.
■ Prepare the inguinal area in case central femoral vascular access is required
intraoperatively.
Anesthesia
■Perform rapid intravenous anesthetic induction to gain immediate control of the
patient's airway.
Ketamine (5mg/kg) and midazolam/valium (0.25 mg/kg) have few negative car-
 diovascular effects compared to barbiturates and propofol.
 Fentanyl (10μg/kg IV) with diazepam (0.5-1.0mg/kg IV) can also be used to
induce general anesthesia  without  causing any significant cardiovascular
compromise.
■ The amount of pressure placed on the diaphragm by the dilated stomach will
hinder effective chest expansion. Assisted ventilation is recommended regardless
of spontaneous ventilatory efforts.
■ Epidural analgesia can reduce the amount of inhalant anesthetic required.
Intraoperative Monitoring
■ECG for detection of dysrhythmias.
■ Blood pressure monitoring is important, especially when the stomach is decom-
pressed completely, and the pressure on the central vein is released.
■A sudden decrease in preload can produce acute hypotension.
■ Many anesthetic agents augment hypotension (iso-, sevo-flurane) or potentiate
dysrhythmias (halothane).
 End-tidal CO, helps monitor for adequate ventilation.
■Pulse oximetry monitors trends of change in hemoglobin oxygen saturation.
Surgery
■Routine ventral abdominal midline incision from xyphoid to pubis to allow adequate
exposure and evaluation of all abdominal organs.
GASTRIC DILATATION-VOLVULUS (GDV) SYNDROME289
 p aq  spd ad s ‘ ss si a f 
packing.
■ Attempt to pass an orogastric tube. The surgeon can gently guide the tube into the
stomach after palpation of the gastric antrum and cardia. Decompression will greatly
facilitate derotation of the stomach.
  Derotate the stomach by using one hand to press the right side of the dilated stomach
down and the other hand to grasp the pyloric region and gently pulled up ventrally
(toward the surgeon) and to the right.
 If passage of the tube is not possible, and the stomach is not able to be derotated, a
large-bore catheter stylet or needle can be used for centesis or attached directly to a
suction apparatus for gas and fluid removal.
 If there is a large amount of food in the stomach, perform a gastrotomy to remove
the ingesta.
■ Control hemorrhage with packing or ligation following gastric derotation.
■ Make note of any questionable gastric wall integrity, then explore the rest of the
abdomen.
■ Gastrectomy may not be required once blood flow is reestablished to the
stomach.
 The spleen is often congested and may be displaced.
 Palpate the splenic arteries and examine the color of the splenic parenchyma to
evaluate the spleen for thrombosis. Lack of palpable pulses in the vessels along the
splenic hilus or dark-purple color means the spleen has lost its blood supply and a
partial or complete splenectomy is warranted.
■  Inspect the pancreas for loss of blood supply and edema.
■]
 Inspect the remaining intestines for abnormalities.
 Finally, evaluate the hepatobiliary and genitourinary organs prior to re-evaluation of
the stomach.
 Once the abdominal exploratory is completed, reinspect the stomach. Black or purple
discoloration is often associated with gastric necrosis. Remove any black or dark
purple regions with TA staples or resection
■ Any area that does not bleed bright red blood likely is nonviable and should be
removed.
■ Large invaginations of ischemic tissues are not recommended because of potential
life-threatening hemorrhage that can occur when the tissues slough.
 In contrast to the serosa, when the mucosa is black, resection is not always neces-
sary. The mucosa will regenerate if there is a healthy submucosa.
11
 Removal of compromised but viable tissue results in decreased hospital stay.
Postoperative monitoring for intragastric hemorrhage is important.
■
 The type of pexy performed is completely dependent on the surgeon's preference
and the time involved.
■ If there has been any removal of gastric tissue, a tube gastrostomy, or combination
tube gastrostomy and incisional gastropexy should be performed to permit continu-
ous decompression and administration of microenteral nutrition.
 The incisional gastropexy is rapidly performed and provides reliable adhesion.
■It is not recommended to suture the gastric wall to the ventral midline abdominal
incision, even in the critical GDV patient. Any future abdominal surgeries will be
severely compromised by the adhesions formed.
■ In the most critical patients with GDV, postoperative gastric decompression is
recommended.
large clots that can occur with large resections.
■ Nasogastric tubes are appropriate when gastric resection is not required.
Nasogastric tubes are preferably placed intraoperatively with proper placement
assured by palpation. Small volume infusion of electrolyte/glucose/glycine containing
fluids feeds the gastric mucosal cells, which rely on intraluminal contents for
nutrition.
■ It is recommended that a jejunostomy or nasojejunostomy tube be placed if any
significant gastric resection or pancreatic trauma has occurred. This permits the
 administration of postoperative enteral nutrition immediately during the postopera-
tive recovery period.
■ Copious saline lavage and suction of the abdomen are necessary. A routine three-
layer closure is performed with placement of dressing over the incision site and
ostomy tube sites.
■ Any evidence of peritonitis warrants bacterial culture and suceptibility of the peri-
toneum and abdominal drainage.
Fluid Resuscitation
■ Intravascular volume resuscitation and analgesia therapy are the keys to success.
followed by gastric decompression.
■ Initially (multiple) peripheral intravenous catheters are inserted, and intravenous
crystalloid and colloid fluids are administered in conjunction with analgesic
drugs.
■ Bolus a balanced, buffered, isotonic solution rapidly in incremental dosages (20-
30 ml/kg) in conjunction with incremental dosages of colloids (such as hydroxyethyl
starch) until perfusion parameters (i.e., blood pressure, heart rate, capillary refill
time) have normalized.
■ Synthetic colloids preserve colloid osmotic pressure during fluid resuscitation.
■ Hypertonic saline may benefit the patient that is rapidly deteriorating (4 ml/kg 7%
solution) with synthetic colloid and buffered isotonic crystalloids.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■  Following the recovery period, few restrictions are necessary.
■ More frequent, less volume feedings may prevent a recurrence of gastric dilation.
GASTRIC DILATATION-VOLVULUS (GDV) SYNDROME
Prevention/ Avoidance
 More frequent, lower volume feedings may reduce the risk of GDV.
 Prophylactic gastropexy is being evaluated as a measure to prevent GDV in dogs at
risk.
■ Finally, not breeding dogs that have a first-degree relative or are a breed at risk for
GDV potentially can reduce the overall incidence of GDV.
Possible Complications
 Gastric necrosis, gastric perforation, septic peritonitis, circulatory shock, and death
are expected to occur in the untreated patient with GDV.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Prognosis is good to excellent for dogs that receive immediate therapy and a surgical
gastropexy procedure.
■ Reported mortality rates are 10 to 54 percent for dogs with GDV. Risk factors sig-
nificantly associated with death prior to suture removal are clinical signs > 6 hours
prior to examination, combined splenectomy and partial gastrectomy, hypotension
at any time, peritonitis, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and present-
ing in a nonambulatory or comatose state.
■ There is a reported reoccurrence rate of 4 to 6 percent of GDV in dogs following
gastropexy. In addition, the gastropexy does not correct problems that cause delayed
gastric emptying.

Gastrointestinal Foreign
Body/Obstruction
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Gastrointestinal obstruction is a common condition encountered in small animal
medicine. Obstruction is classically categorized as either mechanical or functional.
Mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is most often due to entrapped
foreign material within the gastrointestinal lumen, but it can also be caused by intus-
susception, intestinal entrapment, torsion, mucosal or muscular hypertrophy or
neoplasia. Functional obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, also referred to as
ileus, most often results from inflammation or infection and is specifically addressed
elsewhere.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Gastrointestinal mechanical obstruction may occur following indiscriminate inges-
tion of nonfood items. Frequently ingested items that may cause a focal obstruction
include rocks, balls, toys, hair (trichobezars), corncobs, peach pits, plant material,
and clothing items.
■ Focal obstruction most commonly occurs at areas where the stomach and small
intestine narrow (i.e., pylorus, caudal duodenal flexure, and ileocolic junction)
although items may become lodged at any point along the gastrointestinal tract.
Gastrointestinal obstruction with linear material is a unique situation most com-
monly associated with cats, but can occur in dogs as well. Foreign bodies such as
string. thread, or cloth are ingested, become anchored typically at the base of the
tongue or at the pylorus, and then cause a plicated obstruction as the intestinal tract
attempts to move the piece of linear material caudally.
Systems Affected
■ Gastrointestinal—Complete obstruction results in gas and fluid distension orad to
the foreign body. Blood supply to the mucosa and submucosa is damaged, and full-
thickness wall necrosis with perforation may occur at the obstruction site. With
linear foreign body ingestion, peristalsis advances the material into the intestine, and
as a result of the anchor, the intestine will gather around the foreign body. This
plication of the intestines may cause a complete or, more often, partial obstruction.
293
294
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
 Figure 39.1 Intraoperative photograph of a dog with a linear foreign body showing perforation along the
mesenteric border of the mid-jejunum.
Intestinal peristalsis continues against the fixed material and may lacerate the mucosa
and cause perforations along the mesenteric border (Figure 39.1). The resulting
peritonitis from gastrointestinal perforation secondary to foreign body ingestion is
associated with poor wound healing and a high mortality rate.
■ Cardiovascular—Complete mechanical gastrointestinal obstructions can lead  to
breakdown of the mucosal barrier, wall necrosis, or perforation and have a high
likelihood of causing hypovolemic and septic shock.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■There is no specific signalment associated with gastrointestinal foreign body obstruc
tion, although there is a tendency for dogs and cats to be relatively young (<4 years).
■ Cats more commonly ingest linear foreign material than dogs.
■ Clinical signs associated with gastrointestinal obstruction are influenced by location
completeness, and duration of obstruction.
 Acute obstructions have a history most consistent with an acute abdomen: vomiting.
bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain (Figure 39.2).
Complete high obstructions are associated with protracted vomiting, severe dehydra-
tion, electrolyte imbalance, and shock.
■ Animals with chronic, partial, or low obstructions may have more vague clinical
signs: inappetence, weight loss, occasional vomiting, and diarrhea.
GASTROINTESTINAL FOREIGN BODY/OBSTRUCTION

 ary to a small intestinal foreign body.
Historical information may be valuable in aiding the diagnosis of gastrointestinal
obstruction, as owners may report witnessing foreign material ingestion or know that
objects from their home are missing.
CLINICAL FEATURES
 Physical examination may reveal a guarded painful abdomen. Animals will frequently
display clinical signs consistent with dehydration: abnormal skin tent, dry mucous
membranes, delayed CRT, and sunken globes.
 With linear foreign body obstruction, abdominal palpation is frequently painful and
may reveal a large mass of bundled intestines ventrally. Careful oral examination
may reveal the foreign material anchored around the base of the tongue.

■ Functional ileus
■Neoplasia
■ Feline infectious peritonitis (cats)
DIAGNOSTICS
■Survey abdominal radiographs: Occasionally, radio-opague foreign material causing
obstruction can be visualized on abdominal radiographs. However, when the foreign
body cannot be seen, mechanical obstruction may cause varying degrees of gastric
and small intestinal dilation, depending on the location, degree, and duration of
obstruction.
■ For linear foreign body obstruction, the classic radiographic pattern of gathered
 intestines to the right of midline may be apparent, but intestinal loops are not usually
abnormally dilated as the obstruction is incomplete. Small, eccentrically located
luminal gas bubbles, tapered at one or both ends, are a more typical finding for linear
foreign body obstruction.
■ Additional imaging: If the diagnosis is still uncertain, survey radiographs may be
repeated at a later time or other imaging techniques, such as upper gastrointestinal
contrast studies or abdominal ultrasonography, may be performed.
■ Ultrasound may detect foreign bodies by the distal acoustic shadowing and may also
provide information regarding the integrity of the bowel wall and the presence of
free abdominal fluid.
■ Ultrasonographic appearance of a linear foreign body is described as a central hyper-
echoic line with intestine plicated on either side.
■ Gastrointestinal contrast studies can be performed when radiographic or ultrasono-
graphic imaging is uncertain (Figure 39.3). However, barium contrast agents are
material in the stomach and small intestine.
GASTROINTESTINAL FOREIGN BODY/OBSTRUCTION297
contraindicated if perforation is suspected and iodinated contrast agents may exac.
erbate dehydration.
 Laboratory findings may demonstrate a wide range of electrolyte abnormalities, acid-
base disturbances, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, stress or inflammatory leukograms,
and evidence of dehydration.
■ Obstruction at the pylorus or in the proximal duodenum may result in a classic
hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis that occurs from loss of electrolytes
in protracted vomiting. However, these derangements can occur with distal obstruc-
tion as well.
THERAPEUTICS
Gastrointestinal obstruction is considered a surgical emergency. Prior to surgery, the
animal's hemodynamic and electrolyte status should be stabilized, although surgery
atory is necessary to locate suspected obstructions. Conservative management of
linear foreign bodies has been reported, but many cats managed medically ultimately
require surgery.
Surgical Considerations
■ Prophylactic antimicrobials are indicated as these surgeries are at a minimum clas-
sified as clean contaminated.
■Synthetic absorbable monofilament suture (3-0 to 4-0) with a swaged-on taper needle
 is the material of choice for most gastrointestinal surgery.
■ There are numerous techniques described for closure of gastrointestinal incisions.
Regardless of the suture pattern chosen, inclusion of the submucosal layer in the
closure is vital. Full-thickness purchase of the tissue ensures that this holding layer
is incorporated in the suture line.
 Gastrotomy is required for removal of gastric foreign bodies. The ventral body of the
stomach is incised with a longitudinal incision between the lesser and greater cur-
closure include
■Two-layer continuous inverting pattern
■ Full-thickness simple continuous pattern followed by.
■ Partial-thickness (seromuscular) Lembert or Cushing pattern
■Two-layer continuous inverting pattern
■ Simple continuous to close the mucosa and submucosa followed by
Partial-thickness (seromuscular) Lembert or Cushing pattern

problem. These parameters include: color, peristalsis, arterial pulsation, capillary

required for removal of linear foreign bodies. This allows for segmental removal of
the material and minimizes the risk of iatrogenic perforation from too much
traction.
■As with gastrotomy incisions, there are numerous ways to close simple enterotomies.
however double-layer closures are typically avoided due to the potential for luminal
 compromise. Some options for simple enterotomy closure include:
■  Single-layer simple interrupted appositional pattern
■ Single-layer simple continuous appositional pattern (Figure 39.5)
  If intestinal resection and anastomosis are indicated, single-layer simple interrupted
or modified simple continuous approximating patterns are also preferred. In a modi-
fied technique, two suture lines are used: one originating at the mesenteric border
and the other originating at the antimesenteric border. A single-layer full-thickness
continuous suture line is placed from the mesenteric knot to the stay suture at the
 n        sd s   
apart. This is repeated on the other side from the antimesenteric knot to the mesen-
teric knot. There is no difference in reported rates of dehiscence between animals
with simple continuous anastomotic closures and animals with simple interrupted
closures.

COMMENTS
 Possible Complications
■ Early recognition may prevent most major complications, however intestinal necro-
sis, perforation, dehiscence, peritonitis, and sepsis are all possible complications for
gastrointestinal obstruction.
Expected Course and Prognosis
 The prognosis for animals with mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction is dependent
on the location and completeness of the obstruction, as well as the duration of the
obstruction.
■ Linear foreign body obstruction carries a mortality rate of approximately 15 percent
and is noted to be worse in dogs (22 percent) likely to the type of material causing
the obstruction.
■  If the gastrointestinal tract has been perforated and peritonitis is present, the prog-
nosis is guarded. Perforated intestine from foreign material can carry a morality rate
as high as 50 percent.
 If proper surgical technique is not performed or if risk factors for poor intestinal
healing are present (i.e., hypoalbuminemia, peritonitis, immunosuppression), dehis-
cence of gastrointestinal incisions may occur.
■ Mortality associated with this scenario approaches 75 percent.
300
■ Otherwise successful removal of foreign material and reestablishment of a patent
gastrointestinal tract carries a good to excellent prognosis

Glaucoma
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 The definition of glaucoma has changed considerably over time and is now consid-
ered to be a group of related diseases in which an elevation of IOP is a consistent
feature.
The increased lOP is detrimental to vision and ocular health
 Primary glaucoma is a bilateral disease but most of the time one eye is affected before
the other.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Arises from decreased drainage of AH from the eye.
■ Intraocular fluid production cannot be high enough to increase IOP unless drainage
through the iridocorneal (drainage) angle is severely reduced.
11
 Primary glaucoma is due to an anatomical defect in the iridocorneal angle; either
angle may be too narrow or may be covered with the remnant of an embryonic sheet
of tissue.
 It is a breed-related disease in dogs and cats; very common in dogs but rarely seen
in cats.
 Secondary glaucoma is an increase in IOP due to another ocular condition such as
uveitis, neoplasia or lens luxation.
■ Secondary glaucoma is the most common type seen in cats and is also common
in dogs.
■ The most common cause of secondary glaucoma in dogs is lens-induced uveitis
secondary to cataract formation.
Systems Affected
 Glaucoma only affects the ophthalmic system.

1 Sex predilection for primary glaucoma in dogs varies by decade but in some breeds (e.g.
American and English cocker spaniels, basset hound, Cairn terrier, Jack Russell terrier,
Norwegian elkhound, Samoyed and Siberian husky) females were more often affected.
■No sex predilection has been noted in cats.
There is no sex predilection for secondary glaucoma in dogs or cats except in the
cases caused by primary diseases with given sex predilections (e.g., uveodermatologic
syndrome).
■ Age of onset of primary glaucoma in dogs varies considerably by breed but ranges
from 4 to 10 years.
■ No age of onset for glaucoma has been reported in cats.
Historical Findings
 Squinting and epiphora from the affected eye.
Red eye—due to episcleral congestion (Figure 40.1)
■
 Dogs may be more quiet and depressed than usual. A red or cloudy eye may be
noticed.
■ Cats often have no historical findings.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Dogs
■ Clinical signs vary according to stage and type of glaucoma.
■ Early primary glaucoma is insidious and clinical signs may be very subtle and can
be missed unless IOPs are obtained.
GLAUCOMA

 Figure 40.1 Red sclera with corneal cloudiness consistent with glaucoma
■  The signs include slight mydriasis, mild corneal edema, variable episcleral hyper-
emia and mild elevations in IOP (25-30 mm Hg).
■ Signs of moderately advanced glaucoma include pronounced mydriasis, episcleral
hyperemia, distinct corneal edema and variable vision loss. IOP usually ranges from
30 to 40 mm Hg.
■ Advanced glaucoma is characterized by persistent mydriasis, blindness, corneal
edema with striae, and often lens luxation, buphthalmia (ocular enlargement) and

 Signs of secondary glaucoma are those of primary glaucoma with the addition of the
signs of the primary cause (e.g., uveitis, intraocular neoplasm, lens luxation).
Cats
■ Clinical signs are often more subtle than in dogs and therefore may be easily
overlooked.
■ Frequently clinical signs have been present for an extended period and blindness
and buphthalmia are present.
■ Mydriasis is the most consistent finding in early glaucoma.
■ Episcleral hyperemia and conspicuous corneal edema (which occur in dogs) usually
do not develop in cats.
■Elevated IOP is present.

which is alleviated by topical anesthetic
■ No corneal edema or striae.
 Uveitis-aqueous flare is present, IOP is low, pupil is usually miotic.
■ Ulcerative keratitis—-corneal fluorescence staining is positive, corneal edema is local-
ized to one or several areas, and discomfort is alleviated by topical anesthetic.
Corneal endothelial dystrophy—diffuse corneal edema but not painful and IOP is
normal.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Tonometry—elevated 1OP. May range from 25 to 75+ mm Hg depending on stage
and severity. This is the definitive test.
■Gonioscopy-allows for direct visualization of the iridocorneal angle (Figure 40.3).
■ Facilitates differentiating primary vs. secondary glaucoma and prognosis of the
unaffected eye.
■ Ophthalmoscopy—to evaluate the optic disk for cupping.
■ Allows for prognosis. A cupped optic disk indicates a poor prognosis for vision.

THERAPEUTICS
■  Ireatment modality is initially based on the absence or presence of vision on pre-
sentation, willingness of the owner to treat the patient, cost of therapy, and patient
temperament.
■ Objective of therapy in sighted eyes is to lower the IOP as rapidly as possible.
■ This may preserve vision and will alleviate pain.
Medical Therapy for Primary Glaucoma
Initial Medical Intraocular Pressure Control (Emergency)
Osmotic diuretics
■ Mannitol: intravenous: give 1 to 2g/kg over 20-minute period; onset 30 to 60
minutes; duration 5 to 6 hours; can be repeated. Contraindicated if concurrent
congestive heart failure, renal disease, systemic hypertension, or dehydration are
present. Withhold water or intravenous fluids for 2 to 4 hours.
■ Glycerine (Glycerine USP 75%, Osmoglyn 50%): oral; give 1 to 2 ml/kg: not as
effective as mannitol; onset 10 to 30 minutes; duration 4 to 5 hours; can be

systemic hypertension, or dehydration are present. Care should be taken to give
slowly so dog does not inhale it.
■ Will not work well if concurrent uveitis.
■Prostaglandins: topical
■ Latanoprost, travoprost, or bimatoprost
■ topical; apply 1 drop every 12 hours.
■ Cause profound miosis
■ Ineffective in cats
■Miotics: topical
■Parasympathomimetics
i    s  o om      
■ Demecarium bromide (0.125% or 0.250%): apply once daily, contraindicated
in cats.
■Adrenergics: topical
β-blockers
■
Timolol (0.5%), betaxolol, levobunolol: apply 1 drop every 8 to 12 hours
depending on severity.
■Controversial as to effectiveness in dogs.
■ Few side effects.
■ Neuroprotective drugs
■ Calcium channel blockers; oral
■ Amlodipine (0.625 mg once daily); may help protect retinal ganglion cells.
Short-Term Intraocular Pressue Control
 Prostgalandins: use as previously described; good for control; disadvantage is expense.
 Miotics (use as previously described); use with care if anterior uveitis is present as
synechiae can occur or if there is a luxated lens as pupil can constrict around lens
and cause exacerbation of glaucoma.
 Adrenergics (β-blockers): use as previously described.
 Neuroprotective drugs: use as previously described.
 Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
■Topical
■ Dorzolamide, brinzolamide: apply every 8 hours.
■ Oral
■Acetazolamide: 10 mg/kg twice a day, methazolamide: 5 mg/kg twice a day, 0r
dichlorphenamide: 2.5 mg/kg two or three times a day
■ CAls are useful for short- or long-term therapy; CAls are kaluretic agents and
Long-Term Intraocular Pressure Control
■ Miotics, prostaglandins, adrenergics, CAls and neuroprotective drugs may be used
long term in the dosages used above.
■Often surgical therapy.

■ Patient selection is important; must have sighted eye; chronically increasing IOP
despite medical therapy indicates good candidates.
Early surgical intervention is recommended; best potential to save vision
 Two types are available; can use both approaches for some patients.
■ Surgeries that construct alternate drainage methods: anterior chamber shunts
(gonioimplants), cyclodialysis; variable success rate long term; many complica-
tions; should be done by ophthalmologist
■ Surgeries that decrease AH formation: cyclocryotherapy, cyclodiathermy, transs-
cleral cyclophotocoagulation (LASER); these destroy part of the ciliary body which

Available procedures
■ Enucleation—removes the entire problem; high success rate
■ Evisceration—-removal of the contents of the eye with intrascleral prosthesis place-
ment: more cosmetically acceptable for some clients: the eye is still in place and
is subject to trauma and ulcers.

section on uveitis); surgical removal is indicated in lens luxation.
Treatment to lower IOP is as listed previously
Precautions/Interactions
■If uveitis is present osmotic diuretics are ineffective and could worsen the glaucoma;
miotics and prostaglandins (that induce miosis) are not indicated in cases of lens
luxation; osmotics should not be used if there has been head trauma or if there is
dehydration, congestive heart failure, hypertension or renal disease.
Diet
 No changes in patient's diet are necessary; dogs that need chronic CAl therapy should
have potassium supplementation.
COMMENTS

cured and that in almost all of cases, vision will be lost eventually.
■ Medications must be given as directed or IOP can elevate quickly and vision can be
rapidly lost.
■ Monitor for squinting, redness, and cloudy cornea.
Patient Monitoring
■ After an acute glaucoma episode the IOP should be checked in 24 hours and if low,
again in 5 to 7 days. Frequency of subsequent rechecks is based on what is necessary
to maintain IOPs within a normal range.
Prevention/Avoidance
■  There is no way to prevent primary glaucoma because one eye often becomes affected
before the other, the unaffected eye should be treated with an anti-glaucoma drug
(e.g., demercarium bromide: apply 1 drop every 24 hours indefinitely); this may help
delay the onset of glaucoma.
■ Discourage breeding (neuter) of affected dogs.
Possible Complications
■ Few systemic complications; vision loss almost always occurs
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Primary glaucoma will almost always progress to blindness; with therapy vision can
be retained for variable periods of time and pain can be eliminated.

Head Trauma/Traumatic
Brain Injury (TBI)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
1  TBl describes a spectrum of injuries to the brain after blunt or penetrating trauma
to the head.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1Primary brain injury: The injury that occurs to the brain at the time of trauma. This
includes shearing injury, lacerations from depressed skull fractures or penetrating
wounds, and hemorrhage. There is little that can be done medically to reverse
primary brain injury.
 Secondary brain injury: The injury that occurs to the brain as a result of the primary
injury. Most medical therapy in the TBI animal is used to limit secondary injury by
maintaining oxygen delivery to the brain.
Systems Affected
1  Nervous—Direct trauma to the brain or decreased cerebral oxygen delivery can alter
neurological function after trauma.
 Ophthalmic—-TBl often occurs coincident with ocular injury or it may result altered
pupil size (Figure 4l.1), response to light, ocular position, or movement in the
absence of ocular injuries.
1 Cardiovascular—Trauma to the brain can affect the vasomotor center of the brain,
resulting in cardiac arrhythmias or altered vascular tone. In addition, when intracra-
nial pressure increases, peripheral vasoconstriction resulting in hypertension and
reflex bradycardia may be noted.
 Respiratory—Trauma to the brain can affect the respiratory center resulting in an
altered respiratory pattern or a decreased ventilatory drive.
■Musculoskeletal—Skull and jaw fractures are often seen in animals with TBl (Figures
41.2 and 4l.3)
■ Endocrine/Metabolic—Following TBl, animals may develop central diabetes
insipidus.

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Risk Factors/Causes
 There are no specific breed, sex, or age predilections.
■]
 Pediatric and juvenile cats and dogs are frequently presented for TBls. One study
reported that the average age of cats with TBl trauma at 2.5 months and dogs at 2
years.
■Animals allowed to roam free may be more likely to sustain trauma.
Historical Findings
 Blunt trauma is most commonly reported to occur prior to onset of signs of TBI:
often a result of vehicular trauma, falling from a height, intentional or inadvertent
injury from humans or other animals, or crushing injury as occurs when an object
falls onto the animal.
 Penetrating trauma is less common but causes significant TBl; may occur secondary
 to animal bite wounds, projectile injury (e.g. gunshots, arrows), or impalement onto
objects.
■ Owners may report decreased level or loss of consciousness, seizures, or vomiting
that occurs either immediately following or slowly progressing after a traumatic
injury.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■
Altered level of consciousness
Altered pupil size and pupillary light reflexes
■ Postures associated with intracranial hypertension such as decerebrate (i.e., extended
head and neck, extensor rigidity of front limbs, decreased level of consciousness)
and decerebellate rigidity (i.e., extended front limbs, flexed hindlimbs, animal
remains aware).
■ Note: TBl often occurs concurrent with other systemic traumatic injuries; this is
particularly true in animals that sustain blunt trauma.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Usually TBl is obvious, particularly when a traumatic event was witnessed. However,
when a traumatic event was either not witnessed or known, a diagnosis of head
trauma may be more difficult. The presence of abrasions, lacerations, bruises, road
dirt, fractures, and fraying of the claws should alert one to the possibility of trauma.
Otherwise, the following differentials should be considered:
Intracranial diseases
  Inflammatory CNS disease (i.e., GME, pug encephalitis, etc.)
■ Infectious CNS disease (i.e., canine distemper virus, FIP, toxoplasmosis,
Cryptococcus, etc.)
 Neoplasia (primary brain tumors or metastatic brain tumors)
■ Postictal phase following a seizure
Vascular (i.e., infarct, ischemia, hemorrhage)
 Animals with primary intracranial disorders may exhibit symmetrical or asym-
metrical clinical signs. The history in these animals may include lack of traume
and a more gradual onset and progression of clinical signs. Cerebral spinal fluid
analysis, serologic testing, and CT or MRl are used to establish a diagnosis.
■ Extracranial diseases
 Severe hypoperfusion secondary to hypovolemia: the presence of tachycardia,
hypotension, reduced pulse quality. pallor of mucous membranes, and prolon
gation of capillary refll time will help to discern if shock is contributing to
altered mentation.
■Hypoglycemia: blood glucose concentration <60 mg/dL; many animals with TBI
are hyperglycemic.
 Severe hypothermia
 Hepatic encephalopathy: the presence of elevated blood ammonia concentra-
tions, bile acids or evidence of impaired liver function on a chemistry profile
■ Thiamine deficiency: more common in cats on a fish-only diet
■ Lead toxicity: history of exposure, recent home renovations, nucleated red
blood cells, blood lead levels
DIAGNOSTICS
 Skull radiographs are rarely useful, but they may detect depressed skull fractures
CT is the advancing imaging tool of choice following acute TBl; it is superior for
detection of acute hemorrhage, edema, and fractures compared to MRI.
THERAPEUTICS
 Treatment of TBI should focus on optimizing cerebral oxygen delivery by improving
systemic oxygenation, ventilation, and perfusion as well as decreasing ICP.
 Maintenance of blood pressure by fluid resuscitation.
  (   o < )   
(PCO, < 45mm Hg).
■ Decrease ICP (mannitol, hypertonic saline, elevate head and neck 15-30 degrees
avoid jugular compression).
 Decrease cerebral metabolic rate (avoid fever, vocalization/paddling, seizures)
Drug(s) of Choice
Hypertonic saline (7.0-7.8%): 3 to 5 ml/kg (dogs) or 2 to 3ml/kg (cats) IV every 5
to 15 minutes. Can be combined with artificial colloids to prolong duration of action.
 Used to rapidly improve systemic perfusion and decrease ICP.
■Mannitol: 0.5 to 1.5 g/kg as an infusion over 15 to 20 minutes. Should be avoided
in hypovolemic patients until systemic perfusion has been restored.
■ Pure agonist opioid agents should be used for analgesia and the dose titrated to clini-
cal effect (i.e., hydromorphone 0.05-0.2 mg/kg IV or IM every 4-6 hours).
Precautions/Interactions
 Corticosteroids are not indicated in the management of animals with TB1.
 The following drugs may worsen secondary brain injury:
■ Ketamine may increase cerebral metabolic rate and increase the demand for
Oxygen by the injured brain.
■Acepromazine may cause vasodilation and hypotension, which will decrease cere-
bral perfusion.
■ Q antagonists cause bradycardia which could decrease cerebral perfusion and
hypoventilation, which may increase ICP.
■ Dextrose should only be supplemented to those animals who demonstrate a glucose
animals.
Hypotonic crystalloids (i.e., 0.45% NaCl or 5% dextrose in water) should not be used
for intravenous fluid therapy because this could increase cerebral edema.
The use of analgesics should not be avoided because of a concern that they may alter
the animal's neurological status. Pain should be treated appropriately.
■ Partial opioid agonist/antagonists, such as butorphanol, should be avoided as they
are difficult to reverse with naloxone should respiratory depression occur.
Diet
■ Nutrition should be instituted with 72 hours of TBl because head injury induces a
hypercatabolic state.
■ Force feeding should not be used. Placement of an esophagostomy or gastrostomy
tube will facilitate early institution of enteral nutrition in animals with altered levels
of consciousness.
Surgical Considerations
■ Depressed skull fractures
■ Epidural or subdural hematomas
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Owners should be aware that pets surviving severe head trauma may have residual
neurologic deficits that may take months to resolve or may never fully resolve.
Patient Monitoring
■ Modified Glasgow Coma Scale: serial can be used to assess severity of injury and
response to therapy.
■ Blood pressure: maintain systolic pressure >90 mm Hg.
■ Oxygenation: maintain SpO > 96% or PaO2 > 80 mm Hg.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■Prognosis is dependent upon response to therapy. Minimal neurological deficits, lack
of progression of clinical signs over 12 to 24 hours or improvement with therapy are
good prognostic indicators. Poor prognostic indicators include an altered level of
consciousness, which is either static or deteriorates during treatment, progressive
pupillary dilation, or loss of pupillary light response, and loss of physiologic
nystagmus.

nonpyrogenic hyperthermia.
■ Heat stroke, or heat-induced illness, occurs when heat dissipating mechanisms are
exceeded by heat gain, and the body cannot accommodate excessive heat. When left
untreated and severe, heat stroke often leads to multiorgan dysfunction or failure,
and could lead to death.
■ Heat stroke, or nonpyrogenic hyperthermia, is most commonly observed during
warm and humid months, although can occur at any time of year, depending on the
predisposing cause and patient risk factors.
When body temperature exceeds 106°F (4l°C) without signs of inflammation, non-
pyrogenic hyperthermia exists (Figure 42.1).

thermia that can occur due to inhalation of anesthetic agents and is familial in some
breeds of dog, including the Labrador retriever.
■ Other causes of hyperthermia and heat-induced illness include excessive exercise,
thyrotoxicosis, hypothalamic lesions/dysfunction, and status epilepticus.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Under normal circumstances, body temperature is regulated by a balance of heat gain
and compensatory mechanism for heat loss or dissipation. Nonpyrogenic hyperther
mia, or heat stroke, occurs when heat dissipating mechanisms become overwhelmed
and the core body temperature rises.
■ Normal heat dissipation mechanisms in small animals include evaporative loss
through the respiratory tract during panting and hypersalivation, convective and
radiation losses from peripheral vasodilation, and seeking cooler locations. Warm
blood at the periphery loses some heat as the body lies on a cool surface, for example.
■ Nonexertional heatstroke occurs when an animal is enclosed in a warm environment
and cannot escape.
■ Exertional heatstroke occurs when an animal exercises in warm environment and
has not been acclimated or allowed to rest. Strenuous exercise in warm and humid
environments can allow the normal heat dissipating mechanisms to be overwhelmed.
and core body temperature rises above the hypothalamic set point. Vascular endo-
thelial injury, sludging of blood flow, vasodilation, and hypotension contribute to
 decreased vital organ perfusion and tissue ischemia. Without treatment, damage to
the GI tract, liver, kidneys, heart, and central nervous tissue occurs, and can lead to
SIRS, DIC, and MODs. The most extreme cases are often fatal.
Systerms Affected
■ Neurologic—Direct thermal injury and oxidative injury to neurons cause cellular
swelling, tissue hypoxia, and central nervous system dysfunction.
■ Gl—decreased mesenteric blood flow, decreased perfusion, bacterial translocation
from GI tract, sloughing of basement membrane, and thermal damage to enterocytes
■Hepatic—decreased splanchnic/portal blood flow, direct thermal injury to hepato
cytes, hepatocellular ischemia and necrosis, cholestasis, decreased glycogenolysis.
and gluconeogenesis
■ Renal—direct thermal injury to nephrons/renal tubular cells and glomerular base-
ment membrane, hypoxic and oxidative damage, renal ischemia secondary to
decreased perfusion/hypotension, myoglobinuria, and renal failure
■ Cardiovascular—direct thermal injury to cardiac myocytes, tissue ischemia, and
dysrhythmias
■ Respiratory—thermal injury to pulmonary endothelium, increased pulmonary vas-
cular resistance, alveolar edema and hemorrhage, and ARDs in severe cases
■  Musculoskeletal—thermal damage to myocytes and rhabdomyolysis
HEAT STROKE AND HEAT-INDUCED ILLNESS 
321
 Hemic/lymphatic/immune—hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, direct thermal
injury to vascular endothelium, venous stasis, and exposure of tissue factor leads to
Virchow's triad and consumption of platelets and clotting factors, DIC
■Acid-base—respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and lactic acidosis
Geographic Distribution

■ CBC abnormalities may include a stress leukogram, leukopenia or transient
leukocytosis, hemoconcentration or possibly anemia, nucleated red blood cells,
thrombocytopenia.
■ Biochemical profile may show azotemia, hyperbilirubinuria, elevated hepatocellular
and cholestatic enzymes (i.e., ALT, AST, CK, Alk Phos), hypernatremia, hyperchlo-
remia, hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyper- or hypokalemia.

323
Urinalysis may include hyposthenuria, proteinuria, cylindruria, renal tubular casts,
hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, glucosuria; evaluate USG for renal concentrating
ability prior to administration of intravenous fluids, when possible.
Other Laboratory Tests
1
 Blood gas analysis may show mixed acid-base disorder, respiratory alkalosis, or
metabolic acidosis.
1Coagulation profiles may indicate prolonged PT, aPTT; FDPs or D-dimers may be
positive. DIC may be present if PT and PTT are prolonged, and if FDPs or D-dimers
are positive. Antithrombin levels may be decreased. Platelet count is usually decreased,
or trends toward thrombocytopenia.
■ Electrolytes—-hyperkalemia (mild), hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia
■Lactate—elevated
Diagnostic Procedures
■ Minimum data base—PCV/TS, peripheral blood smear evaluation, platelet estimate,
blood glucose, BUN

■Urinalysis
■Lactate
■ aPTT and PT
■± D-dimers
Imaging
■Thoracic radiographs may help identify underlying cardiopulmonary disease or pre-
disposing causes of heat stroke.
■ Abdominal radiographs and/or ultrasound may help identify underlying disease
process. May observe fluid-filled loops of bowel.
■ CT or MRI may help identify hypothalamic or other mass lesion.
THERAPEUTICS
The key to treatment is early recognition and immediate correction of
hyperthermia.
■ ABCs of emergency: airway, breathing, and circulation: establish an airway if airway
obstruction, clear mucus or vomitus from oropharynx and trachea, if necessary;
intubate if airway obstruction; need to perform emergency tracheostomy or tracheal

radiant cooling measures. Do not immerse in cold or ice water or ice packs because
this can promote peripheral vasoconstriction. Peripheral vasoconstriction is one of
the primary means of heat dissipation. By removing the compensatory mechanism,
a general rule, patients should be cooled to a temperature of 39.4°℃ (l03°F), then
external cooling measures should be stopped, to avoid overcooling.
■ Continuous temperature monitoring: hospitalization is required until temperature
has normalized and is stable even in the least critical patients.
■ Intensive care monitoring is common and necessary in most cases.
■
 Treat complications such as DIC, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, ARDS, cerebral
edema, seizures, renal failure, and MODS.
 Treat underlying disease and/or correct predisposing factors.
■  Isotonic crystalloid fluid therapy based on degree of dehydration and fluid loss (GI
tract)
■ Synthetic colloids (i.e., hydroxyethyl starch) in incremental boluses (5 ml/kg) or 20
to 30ml/kg per day may be required to aid in the treatment of hypotension or
hypoproteinemia.
■ Provide supplemental oxygen by nasal or nasopharyngeal oxygen catheter, tracheal
oxygen, 0xygen cage, or oxygen mask (50-150 ml/kg per minute).
■Mechanical ventilation may be required, depending on the degree of cerebral edema.

Drug(s) of Choice
■ Antibiotics—broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover both gram-negative and gram-
positive infections; choices include ampicillin (22 mg/kg IV every 6-8 hours) with
enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg IV every 24 hours in dogs, 5 mg/kg IV every 24 hours in cats),
cefazolin (22 mg/kg IV every 8 hours) with enrofloxacin, Unasyn (22 mg/kg/IV every
8 hours)
■Gastroprotectants

 Dolasetron (0.6 mg/kg IV every 24 hours)
■Ondansetron (1 mg/kg IV every 8-12 hours)
■Cerenia (1 mg/kg SQ, 2 mg/kg PO)
■Metoclopramide (1-2 mg/kg per day IV CRI)
■H blockers
■ Famotidine 0.5 to 1 mg/kg IV every 12 hours
■ Ranitidine 0.2 to 2 mg/kg IV or PO every 8 to 12 hours
■ Cimetidine 5mg/kg IV every 6 to 8 hours
■ Proton pump inhibitors
■ Omeprazole 0.5 to 1 mg/kg PO every 12 hours
■Pantoprazole 1 mg/kg IV
 Sucralfate (0.25-1 g PO three times a day)
Antiarrhythmic drugs
■ Lidocaine (2 mg/kg IV bolus, then 50-100μg/kg per minute IV CRI)
■ Procainamide 6-10 mg/kg IV loading dose over 1-2 minutes, then 20-40 mcg/kg
min 1V CR1 in 5% destrose in water; or 10-22 mg/kg PO every 8 hours
■Dextrose (0.5 g/kg 25% dextrose IV, followed by 2.5-5% dextrose CRI)
■Seizures
■Diazepam (0.5-1 mg/kg IV)
■ Phenobarbital loading (16-20 mg/kg IV); dose may be divided into four or five
smaller doses and given every 30 minutes, provided that patient is rousable in
between doses
■ Pentobarbital (3-15 mg/kg IV slowly to effect)
■Propofol (4-7 mg/kg IV to effect, followed by 0.1-0.6 mg/kg per minute IV CR1)
■ Thrombocytopenia
■Platelet concentrate available from commercial blood banks
Contraindications
Glucocorticoids
■Although glucocorticoids reportedly can stabilize cellular membranes, there has been
no documented benefit proven for their use in hyperthermic patients, and they are not
recommended due to the risk of further decreasing mesenteric and renal perfusion.
Nonsteroidal Anti-lnflammatory Drugs
■NSAIDs of any form are contraindicated in heat stroke due to the risk of decreasing
mesenteric and renal blood flow, and the risk of increasing Gl ulceration. Dipyrone
and flunixin meglumine specifically are contraindicated. Patients with exertional and
nonexertional heat stroke are hyperthermic because of decreased ability to adequately
dissipate heat. The mechanism of elevated body temperature is much different from
 that of pyrogenic hyperthermia, in which some NSAIDs may be indicated, on a case-
by-case basis.
Overcooling
■Overcooling should be avoided due to the risk of overshooting and causing iatrogenic
demands of the body, and can cause temperature to further increase.
Surgical Considerations
COMMENTS
Client Education
■Be aware of clinical signs.
■ Educate client how to appropriate cool overheated animals prior to transport.
■ An animal that has had prior episodes of heat stroke may be predisposed to additional
episodes of heat stroke, even at lower environmental temperatures.
Patient Monitoring
■  Monitor patients very closely when attempting to cool them and for a minimum of
24 hours afterwards because hypothermia can occur.
■ Monitor the patient closely for signs of adverse sequelae, including DlC, renal failure.
respiratory distress (ARDS, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumo-
nia), and other organ failure.
Monitor closely for renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria
■ Monitor parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate and effort, blood pressure
pulse oximetry and/or arterial blood gas, body temperature, ECG, coagulation status
(platelet count, PT, aPTT), BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, lactate, glucose, urinalysis
to check for renal tubular casts, urine output, PCV, and total protein.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Educate clients to not confine animals to areas where they cannot escape heat (e.g..
cars, tied in yard without water or shelter/shade).
■ Exercise animals during the coolest portions of the day
HEAT STROKE AND HEAT-INDUCED ILLNESS
327
■ Acclimate the animal to short bursts of exercise or work before a longer training or
working period.
■Rest animals that are working or exercising every 30 minutes and provide access to
shade and water.
■ Animals that are obese, have brachycephalic airway disease, laryngeal disorders, or
any other predisposing factor should avoid exercise and remain in cool environments
with fans or air conditioning.

cemia, progressive worsening of azotemia, development of DiC or refractory hypo-
tension, elevated total bilirubin, hypoproteinemia, respiratory difficulty or pulmonary
edema, oliguria or anuria.
 Affected animals may have predisposition to other episodes of hyperthermia due to
change in the sensitivity of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory set point.
 Prognosis more guarded in animals that present with hypothermia after cooling or

Hemoabdomen
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
1A collection of blood within the abdominal cavity
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Blunt trauma such as automobile injury or high-rise fall
 Penetrating trauma such as dog bite wounds, gun shot wounds, knife wounds.
impalement by foreign object
 Rupture of abdominal vessels secondary to gastric dilatation and volvulus or splenic
torsion
 Rupture of tumor associated with abdominal organs (i.e., liver, spleen, adrenal)
 Coagulopathy either congenital or acquired (i.e., anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity.
hepatic disease, hemophilia)
Postsurgical complication (i.e., slipped ovarian ligatures)
Incidence/Prevalence
■ Unknown, more common in dogs than in cats
Systems Affected
 Cardiovascular—hypotension due to blood loss, cardiac arrhythmias may occur
secondary to hypoxia
 Hemic/lymphatic/immune—anemia due to blood loss, may not be apparent until
fluid compartment shifts have occurred, possibly thrombocytopenia secondary to
platelet consumption
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Golden retriever, German shepherd, Labrador retriever, and other large-breed dogs
have breed predilection for hemangiosarcoma.
 Reported higher incidence of hemangiosarcoma in male dogs
329
BLAC KWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Middle age to older dogs in general have increased incidence of hemoabdomen asso-
ciated with neoplasia.
■Intact free-roaming male dogs and cats have increased risk of traumatic
hemoabdomen.
 Hemoabdomen due to neoplasia is rare in cats.
■ Hemoabdomen in general can be seen in any age or breed.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Free-roaming dogs and cats have increased risk for blunt and penetrating trauma
that result in hemoabdomen.
■ Congenital or acquired coagulopathy
■ Exposure toanticoagulant
rodenticides increases potential for acquired
coagulopathy.
■ Presence of abdominal mass, particularly spleen or liver associated, increases risk of
hemoabdomen.
Historical Findings
Weakness or ataxia
 Acute collapse
■ Abdominal distension
 Depression
Anorexia
Vomiting
■ Possible history of trauma, history of coagulopathy, or history of exposure to anti-
coagulant rodenticides
CLINICAL FEATURES
■Lethargy
■Weakness
■ Pale mucous membranes
Abdominal distension with fluid wave
Tachycardia with weak peripheral pulses
Tachypnea
 Possibly abdominal mass
 Possibly external wounds if hemoabdomen is traumatic
■Possibly bleeding from other sites, petechiae, or ecchymoses with coagulopathy or
trauma
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Peritonitis-can be differentiated on the presence of large numbers of degenerate
neutrophils and the presence of bacteria on cytologic examination of abdominal fluid
from animals with peritonitis.
HEMOABDOMEN 331
Hypovolemic shock—may co-exist with hemoabdomen; hypovolemic shock due to
other causes of fluid and blood loss may not result in abdominal effusion
 Uroabdomen—Abdominal fluid is generally serosanguineous rather than hemor-
rhagic with uroabdomen, and the creatinine, BUN and potassium of the abdominal
fluid will be higher than that of peripheral blood.
 Splenic torsion—Hemoabdomen may occur secondary to splenic torsion but is not
present in all cases. Best differentiated on basis of abdominal ultrasound.
Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia—differentiated by the absence of abdominal
fluid and by evidence of immune-mediated red blood cell destruction on complete
blood count (RBC agglutination, spherocytosis)
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count
■ Anemia but only after enough time has elapsed for fluid shifts to occur (several
 n q a e a n ‘   (
anemic.
Leukocytosis may be noted due to stress, neoplasia, or trauma. Thrombocytopenia
may be noted due to platelet consumption. Primary thrombocytopenia may rarely
cause hemoabdomen.
■  Chemistry panel—-Hypoalbuminemia may occur secondary to blood loss.
 Coagulation panel—-Elevations in PT and/or PTT may indicate underlying congenital
or acquired coagulopathy or DlC occurring secondary to abdominal hemorrhage. In
one study 84 percent of dogs with nontraumatic hemoabdomen had a secondary
coagulopathy.
 Abdominal radiographs--Generally not very rewarding as the presence of abdominal
fluid causes a generalized loss of detail although a mass effect may be seen with
neoplasia.
■Abdominocentesis
■ Can be "blind" four quadrant or ultrasound guided. May reveal the presence of
nonclotting blood (or other fluid) within the abdominal cavity: positive abdomi-
nocentesis indicates that there is >5 ml/kg of blood within the abdominal cavity.
■ Clotting of the blood indicates either rapid, ongoing hemorrhage or perforation
of a vessel or organ during the abdominocentesis procedure.
■ PCV/TS of abdominal fluid—PCV of abdominal fluid will be greater than that of
 peripheral blood if active bleeding is occurring.
DPL
■ May be helpful if abdominocentesis is negative.
■ Instill 10 to 22 ml/kg of warm fluid into the abdomen using a large-bore, multiply
fenestrated over-the-needle catheter, distribute fluid by rotating or walking the
patient, then aspirate fluid back by routine abdominocentesis.
■ PCV > 5% is indicative of hemorrhage; serial hematocrits can be performed on
DPL fluid to assess for ongoing hemorrhage.
332
BLAC KWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
 Figure 43.1 This abdominal radiograph shows a mass effect in the cranial to mid-abdomen and mild loss of
abdominal detail consistent with abdominal fluid. This patient was diagnosed with a splenic mass on ultrasound,
and free abdominal fluid was noted.
■ Abdominal ultrasound
■Very sensitive (96 percent) in detecting abdominal fluid.
■ Useful for guiding abdominocentesis and evaluating for primary and metastatic
abdominal masses.
■ Thoracic radiographs
■ Should be performed with any bleeding abdominal mass to evaluate for metastasis
and should be performed with blunt trauma to evaluate for concurrent thoracic
injury or diaphragmatic hernia.
Pathological Findings
■Vary depending on the cause for hemoabdomen.
 Other traumatic injuries may be present with blunt or penetrating trauma.
■
With neoplasia, mass of liver, spleen, or adrenal gland may be noted and possibly
evidence of metastatic disease.
■With coagulopathy, hemorrhage in other areas may be noted.
Histopathologic Findings
 Vary depending on underlying cause.
■ With neoplasia, hemangiosarcoma of the spleen is the most common tumor causing
hemoabdomen but benign splenic hematoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and adrenal
adenocarcinoma can also result in hemoabdomen.
HEMOABDOMEN
333
CE
 Figure 43.2 Abdominal ultrasound is quite sensitive in detecting free abdominal fluid and can be used to
guide abdominocentesis as well as to evaluate for a cause of hemorrhage. This patient has free fluid within the
abdomen and a splenic mass, noted with the yellow markers.
THERAPEUTICS
■Treat hemorrhagic shock by administration of supplemental oxygen and intravenous
fluids.
■ Isotonic crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution, Normosol-R, Plasmalyte-A) can be
administered at shock dosages (up to 90 ml/kg in the dog and 50 ml/kg in the cat)
■Fluid administration should be titrated to reach a systolic blood pressure of approxi-
mately 80 mm Hg.
 Synthetic colloids such as Hetastarch can be administered at 10 to 20 ml/kg in 5 ml/
kg incremental doses.
■ Transfusion with packed red blood cells (ll ml/kg) should be utilized to maintain
PCV above 25 percent.
 Hemoglobin based oxygen carriers (such as oxyglobin 5-l0 ml/kg) can also be uti-
lized to treat hemorrhagic shock.
 Treat underlying primary or secondary coagulopathies.
■ Fresh frozen plasma (10-15 ml/kg) is used to restore clotting factors.
■ Vitamin Kl should be administered with hepatopathy or Vitamin K antagonist
rodenticide toxicity.
Control hemorrhage.
■  External counterpressure can be applied by using towels secured with tape to wrap
the hind limbs, pelvis, and abdomen starting at the hind feet. Avoid excessive
pressure (bandage should be loose enough to fit your hand underneath) to avoid
place 2 to 4 hours then gradually remove over 8 to 12 hours.
334
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
 Figure 43.3 A compression bandage has been applied to the hind limbs, pelvis, and abdomen of this patient
to help control abdominal hemorrhage.
■ Surgery on an emergent basis is indicated with bleeding abdominal masses and pen-
etrating abdominal wounds.
■ Surgery is indicated with blunt trauma if the patient is not responding to fluid
resuscitation, the abdominal PCV is rising. and there is progressive abdominal
distension despite appropriate resuscitative measures.
■ Abdominal exploratory is rarely required in cases of traumatically induced
hemoabdomen.
 Surgery is contraindicated in patients with primary coagulopathy.
■ Control pain from trauma or surgery using fentanyl CRI (2-5μg/kg per hour), hydro-
morphone (0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV or SQ every 6-8 hours), or morphine (Dog: 0.1-0.5 mg/
kg per hour IV CR1 or 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV every 3-4 hours, 0.2-1 mg/kg IM or SQ
every 4-6 hours).
■Prevent infection in the case of penetrating abdominal wounds.
■ Clean and bandage the wounds.
 Administer antibiotics (cefazolin 22 mg/kg IV every 6-8 hours)
With gastrointestinal visceral or bite wounds the antibiotic spectrum should be
expanded to include anaerobic organisms using cefoxitin (20-30 mg/kg IV every
6-8 hours), ampicillin/sulbactam (20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours), or a combination
of ampicillin (22mg/kg IV every 6-8 hours) with enrofloxacin (5-10mg/kg IV
every 24 hours).
Precautions/Interactions
■  Avoid aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications that decrease
■Hypertension should be avoided, as this can lead to disruption of clot formation and

(between 80 and 1l0mm Hg systolic) is considered optimal in order to maintain
organ and tissue perfusion but avoid exacerbation of bleeding.
Activity
■ Usually limited in order to allow recovery from abdominal surgery or to prevent
further bleeding in cases of coagulopathy.
Surgical Considerations
  Emergent surgery is recommended for patients with bleeding abdominal masses and
penetrating abdominal wounds.
citation or with rising abdominal PCV and progressive abdominal distension.
 These patients are often hemodynamically unstable and fluctuations in blood pres
sure and heart rate may complicate anesthesia.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Client should be informed of cost and prognosis associated with treatment based on
underlying cause for hemoabdomen.
Patient Monitoring
 Assess blood pressure frequently (every 5 minutes) until patient is stable then gradu-
ally less often after the patient stabilizes.
Electrocardiogram is recommend continuously or at least every 3 to 4 hours for the
first 24 hours in patients with abdominal or thoracic trauma or who have undergone
splenectomy.
 PCV/TS may need to be monitored every 4-6 hours initially.
■ Coagulation panel is needed, particularly in patients with existing coagulopathy
(either primary or secondary).
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Abdominal masses cannot be prevented but surgical removal as soon as they are
identifed can prevent onset of bleeding.
 Avoid allowing pets to roam free, which increases the potential for trauma and access
to anticoagulant rodenticides.
 Possible Complications
■Hemorrhage
■Cardiac dysrhythmias
■ DIC
336
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Varies depending on underlying cause of hemoabdomen and on presence of co-
existing injuries in cases of trauma.
■Prognosis in general is guarded to fair.
■ Patients with hemoabdomen that are anemic and have a splenic mass have a 76
 percent likelihood of malignant neoplasia.
■ With hemangiosarcoma, microscopic metastasis has typically occurred prior to
the time of presentation.
■ Median survival times of 2 to 3 months with surgery and 4 to 6 months with
adjunctive chemotherapy have been reported; common sites for metastasis include
the liver and right atrium.

Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Clinical syndrome of neurologic and cognitive dysfunction that result from the
metabolic consequences of congenital or acquired liver disease.
 Represents a continuum of clinical signs from mild, subtle abnormalities to severe
neurologic disease.
1
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Due to (l) CPSS, (2) APSS, or less commonly (3) fulminant hepatic failure.
CPss is the most common cause in small animals.
Hyperammoniaemia is a key pathophysiological mechanism.
 Ammonia is generated from amino acids in diet, catabolism of glutamine by entero-
cytes, or from peripheral tissue (e.g., skeletal muscle). Urease-producing bacteria in
the Gl tract degrade urea into ammonia. In health, the liver efficiently removes
ammonia from the portal circulation and detoxifies it to urea and glutamine.
 Hyperammoniaemia induces neurologic dysfunction by: (l) causing astrocyte swell-
ing (low-grade cerebral edema), (2) inducing oxidative injury to astrocytes, and (3)
sensitizing the CNS to other precipitating factors of HE. This ultimately affects CNS
gene expression, protein/mRNA modification, cell signaling, and finally astrocyte and
neuronal function resulting in clinical HE.
 Severity of HE does not always correlate with degree of hyperammoniaemia likely
because other factors exacerbate astrocyte swelling and oxidative injury.
Systems Affected
■ Nervous—Primary system affected by HE. Cerebral dysfunction is common (e.g..
behavioral changes, altered mentation) but multifocal and lateralizing neurologic
deficits and seizures can also occur.
■ Gl—decreased appetite (can rarely be increased), vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss
can be due to central effects of HE or underlying liver disease.
Urinary—PU/PD due to primary PD and/or primary PU (nephrogenic diabetes insipi-
dus). Lower urinary tract signs are also possible as a result of secondary infection or
ammonium biurate stone formation.

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Median age of dogs diagnosed with CPsS is 12 months; 37 percent of dogs with CPSS
are older than 2 years of age.

■ CPSS has been shown to be heritable in the Yorkshire terrier, Cairn terrier, and Irish
wolfhound; heritability is suspected in other breeds.
■ Increased risk for CPSS in the Havanese, Yorkshire terrier, Maltese, and pug
breeds.
■ For cats, CPsS occurs most commonly in the domestic shorthair.
      s       
Risk Factors/Causes
■ High protein meal, G1 bleeding (e.g., ulceration, coagulopathy, GI parasites), infec-
tion, sedatives/anesthesia, diuretics, electrolyte disturbances (e.g., acidosis, hypona-
tremia, hypokalemia), trauma, azotemia, stored blood transfusion
Historical Findings
■ Vague, episodic abnormalities are common such as lethargy, depression, and changes
in personality or behavior.
 Clinical signs may worsen after a meal.
■ Neurologic abnormalities (seizures are uncommon)
■ For CPss, poor growth and small body stature
■ For APsS, weight loss and poor body condition
Vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite
■ Poor tolerance of sedation/anesthesia

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Neurologic disease—hypoglycemia, toxins (lead, ethylene glycol), congenital neuro-
logic disease (hydrocephalus), thiamine deficiency (cats), drug toxicity, neoplasia.
inflammatory/infectious CNS disease
■GI disease—other primary GI disease
■  Urinary symptoms—urolithiasis, UT1, neoplasia
DIAGNOSTICS
 Bile acids (resting, pre and post-prandial)—an abnormal postprandial bile acid con-
centration should always be present in HE. It is possible to have normal resting/
fasting bile acids test in the presence of severe liver disease.
■ Blood ammonia (resting, post-prandial, ammonia tolerance)—degree of elevation
may not correlate with degree of HE. Resting ammonia abnormal in 62 to 88 percent
of animals with Pss. Strict sample handling required to prevent false-negative results.
Worsening of clinical signs may occur with ammonia tolerance test.
 Serum chemistry—evidence of decreased liver function commonly present (i.e.
hypoalbuminemia, low BUN, hypocholesterolemia, hypoglycemia), liver enzyme
elevation (absent or mild with CPSS), and hyperbilirubinemia (uncommon with
CPSS)
 Complete blood count—decreased MCV common with CPSS, may also be seen with
 APSS. Mild nonregenerative normochromic anemia and variable leukocytosis may
also occur. Target cells (dogs)
■ Urinalysis—ammonium biurate crystals (26-57 percent dogs and 16-42 percent cats
CPSS), iso/hyposthenuria
 Ultrasound-operator-dependent sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of CPss (80
percent sensitivity, 66.7 percent specificity for extrahepatic CPsS; 100 percent sen-
sitivity for intrahepatic CPss). Dilated left gonadal vein is consistent with portal
hypertension and APSS.

Precautions/Interactions
■Avoid NSAIDs due to risk of GI ulceration
■ Caution with drugs metabolized by liver
■ Oral neomycin rarely causes ototoxicity nephrotoxicity, severe diarrhea, and intes
tinal malabsorption.
Alternative Drugs
■ Flumazenil (0.02 mg/kg IV)—BZD antagonist, for unresponsive HE, blocks endog-
enous BZD
■ Sarmazenil (3-8mg/kg IV, dogs, experimental)—BZD partial inverse agonist, for
unresponsive HE, blocks increased GABAergic tone.
■ Oral branched chain amino acids
■ Stimulation of urea and glutamine synthesis (zinc, L-ornithine aspartate)
Diet
■ In severe or emergent cases, withhold food to decrease protein load and prevent
aspiration in patients with altered consciousness.
 Commercial diet specifically formulated for liver disease is recommended (e.g., Hill's
Vd).
 Feed small amounts of food several times daily.

  Use of a low protein diet is no longer recommended in people; it is possible that this
may lead to weight loss and worsening of the patient's clinical condition.
■ Hepatic lipidosis (cats): feeding a well-balanced diet containing arginine is crucial
to reverse lipidosis and subsequently HE.
Surgical Considerations
 Surgical correction of CPSs is recommended for definitive treatment.
Postoperatively. 10 percent incidence complications. 7.l percent mortality 80
percent excellent outcome, 6 percent poor outcome
 Transvenous coil embolization is a minimally invasive alternative to surgery; this is
not widely available.
Caution with anesthesia/sedatives; reversible pre-anesthetics are recommended (e.g--
opioids, BZDs)
COMMENTS
 Repeated, directed physical examinations are crucial to identify underlying risk
factors such as any local'systemic infection or Gl bleeding (e.g., rectal examination
for melena).
Expected Course and Prognosis
■
HE temporarily reversible with medical therapy

Hyperosmolarity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Osmolarity—expressed in mOsm/L represents the number of particles per liter of
solution
 Osmolality—-expressed in mOsm/kg: represents the number of particles per kilogram
or solution
Serum concentrations >3l0 mOsm/L in dogs and 330 mOsm/L in cats are considered
hyperosmolar
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Serum sodium is responsible for most of the osmotically active particles that contribute
to serum osmolarity; serum glucose and urea also contribute to serum osmolarity.
Anything that causes water loss increases concentrations of solutes in plasma or
serum, thereby increases serum osmolarity
Blood volume, hydration status, and ADH secretion are intimately involved in con-
trolling extracellular fluid volume.
  Low circulating blood volume stimulates carotid and aortic baroreceptors to respond
to changes in blood pressure, causing the secretion of ADH.
■Hyperosmolarity affects the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus and stimulates ADH
secretion from the neurohypophysis; the hypothalamic thirst center is also stimulated
and causes an increase in water consumption to counteract the serum hyperosmolar-
ity by solute dilution.
Rapid increases in serum osmolarity cause water movement across its concentration
gradient from intracellular to extracellular spaces, resulting in neuronal dehydration,
cell shrinkage, and cell death; cerebral vessels may weaken and hemorrhage.
Systems Affected
■ Nervous—excessive thirst may be the first sign of hyperosmolarity. Central nervous
depression may lead to coma.
■  Cardiovascular--hypotension and decreased ventricular contractility
 Renal/urologic—low urine output (<l-2 ml/kg per hour)
349
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Dogs and Cats
■ Hypodipsia and hyperosmolarity have been reported in young female miniature
schnauzers.
General comments
■ Primarily neurologic or behavioral
■Severity is related more to how quickly hyperosmolarity occurs than to the absolute
magnitude of the change.
■ More likely to occur if serum osmolarity is >350mOsm/L and usually severe
if >375 mOsm/L
Historical Findings
■Anorexia, lethargy vomiting, weakness, disorientation, ataxia, seizures, and coma
■Polydipsia followed by hypodipsia
Physical Examination Findings
■Normalities or abnormalities may reflect underlying disease.
■In addition to historical findings, dehydration, tachycardia, hypotension, weak
pulses, and fever may be detected.
Increased Solutes
Hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, severe azotemia, ethylene glycol toxicity, salt poison-
ing, sodium phosphate enemas in cats and small dogs, radiographic contrast solution,
administration of ethanol, aspirin toxicosis, shock, lactate in patients with lactic
acidosis, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate in patients with ketoacidosis, liquid
enteral nutrition, and parenteral nutrition solutions.
Decreased Extracellular Fluid Volume
■ Dehydration—gastrointestinal loss, cutaneous loss, third space loss, low water con-
sumption, and polyuria without adequate compensatory polydipsia
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Medical conditions that predispose—renal failure, diabetes insipidus, diabetes mel-
litus, hyperadrenocorticism, hyperaldosteronism, and heat stroke
 Therapeutic hyperosmolar solutions, hypertonic saline, sodium bicarbonate, sodium
phosphate enemas in cats and small dogs, mannitol, and parenteral nutrition
solutions
 High ambient environmental temperatures
■Fever
HYPEROSMOLARITY
7
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■  Primary CNs disease and neoplasia may be characterized by altered mentation, but
serum osmolarity is normal.
■ Physical evidence or history of injury usually helps to rule out CNs depression
caused by cranial trauma.
 Perform a thorough physical examination to assess hydration and obtain information
regarding previous therapy that may have included sodium-containing fluids of
hyperosmolar solutions.
Laboratory Findings
Drugs That May Alter Laboratory Results
■ Excessive administration of sodium-containing fluids or hyperosmolar solutions
increase serum osmolarity.
Valid if run in human laboratory
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
 High PCV, hemoglobin, and plasma proteins in dehydrated patients; serum electro-
lytes may also be increased.
Hyperosmolarity is an indication to evaluate serum sodium and glucose
concentrations.
1Without the presence of excessive unmeasured osmoles, estimated serum osmolarity
may be calculated from serum chemistries as follows:
1.86(Na + K) + BUN + glucose/2.8 ×18
1 Normally, calculated osmolarity should not exceed measured osmolarity; if it is, it
is considered a laboratory error.
■  If measured osmolarity exceeds the calculated osmolarity determine the osmolar
gap.
■ Osmolar gap is equal to measured osmolarity less calculated osmolarity
■ High measured osmolarity and normal calculated osmolarity with a high osmolal gap
indicate the presence of unmeasured solutes (not Na, K, BUN, or glucose).
■ High measured osmolarity and high calculated osmolarity with a normal osmolar

 Serum sodium concentration may be artifactually low in patients with severe hyper-
glycemia and hyperosmolarity.
 Fasting hyperglycemia and glucosuria is supportive of a diagnosis of diabetes
mellitus.
■  Numerous calcium oxalate crystals in the urine suggest ethylene glycol toxicosis
■High urine specific gravity rules out diabetes insipidus.
Other Laboratory Tests
■Urine osmolarity lower than serum osmolarity suggests diabetes insipidus; concen-
trated urine rules out diabetes insipidus.
Imaging
ylene glycol toxicosis.
THERAPEUTICS
■Mild hyperosmolarity without clinical signs may not warrant specific treatment, but
diagnose and treat underlying diseases.
 Hospitalize patients with moderate to high osmolarity (> 350 mOsm/L) and patients
exhibiting clinical signs and gradually lower serum osmolarity with intravenous
fluids while a definitive diagnosis is pursued.
■Administer D5W or 0.45% NaCl slowly IV.
■Free water deficit can be calculated by the following formula:
■ Free water deficit less 0.4 × lean body weight in kg × (Plasma Na/l40) - 1
■ The goal is to not drop sodium more than 15 mEq/L in an 8-hour period; that is,
 d    q s  dop n n st p  
■ Initially, 0.9% NaCl may be used to restore normal hemodynamics and replace
dehydration deficits, replace half of dehydration deficits over 12 hours, and the
remainder over 24 hours, then switch to D5W or 0.45% NaCl.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Seizures can be controlled with diazepam, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, or
propofol.
Contraindications
■ Hypertonic saline and hyperosmolar solutions
Precautions/Interactions
■ May use 0.9% NaCl initially, but rapid administration may worsen neurologic signs

Hypertension
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Systemic hypertension is an elevation of systemic arterial blood pressure.
Systemic hypertension is of concern when the elevation of blood pressure is persis-
tent and causing or likely to cause target organ damage.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Systemic hypertension may be stress related (i.e., "situational" or "white coat" hyper-
tension), idiopathic (no identifiable cause), or occur as a complication of another
systemic disease ("secondary" hypertension).
Secondary hypertension is the most common form of systemic hypertension in
dogs and cats. The most common diseases associated with systemic hypertension
are:
■Dogs:
Acute or chronic renal failure
■
 Protein-losing (glomerular) renal diseases
Hyperadrenocorticism
■Diabetes mellitus
■Pheochromocytoma
■ Cats:
■Renal disease of any variety
■Hyperthyroidism
■ More rare causes in both species include
■]
Hyperaldosteronism (cats)
■
Acromegaly (cats)
■
Sex hormone abnormalities (dogs)
1  Pathogenesis is unclear in most diseases. Both cardiac output and systemic vascular
resistance affect blood pressure, and alterations in either of these parameters (or their
contributing components) can lead to systemic hypertension.
355
356
Systems Affected
■ Any vascular bed may sustain damage from acute or chronic systemic hypertension
Most commonly affected organ systems include:
■ Eyes
■Kidneys
■Brain
■Heart/vascular system
■ Ophthalmologic
Effects
("hypertensive
retinopathy,"
"hypertensive
choroidopathy"):
■ Severe (often associated with acute blindness)
■]
Retinal detachment (complete or partial)
■ Hyphema
■
 Retinal hemorrhages
■ Less severe (may only be obvious on ophthalmologic examination)
 Papilledema
■
Vascular tortuosity and segmentalization
■Periarterial intraretinal infiltrates
■ Renal Effects:
 Elevated intraglomerular pressure due to abnormal renovascular autoregulation
(ineffective vasoconstriction of renal afferent arterioles) leads to glomerular
 damage (glomerulosclerosis and atrophy, proliferative glomerulitis) and results in
protein loss in urine (proteinuria)
■Proteinuria leads to tubular damage
tubular inflammation and atrophy
 Interstitial fibrosis
1 Central Nervous System Effects:
 Damage may result from focal hemorrhage or from cerebral edema.
 Intracranial abnormalities responsible for predominant signs (*hypertensive
encephalopathy")
1 Most common signs of hypertensive encephalopathy
Seizures (grand mal or focal facial)
 Altered mentation: dementia, depression, stupor, coma
Isolated cranial nerve deficits
■ Nystagmus
■Photophobia
■Cardiovascular Effects:
■Left ventricular hypertrophy
■
 Systolic heart murmur
■
Gallop rhythm
■ Sensitivity to fluids (i.e., “normal" amounts of fluid administration result in con-
gestive heart failure)
 Overt heart failure is rare unless fluids are administered.
■Epistaxis
HYPERTENSION
357
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■
 There are no known breed predilections for the development of systemic hyperten-
sion, but sighthounds (e.g., greyhounds, deerhounds) have normal blood pressure
ranges that are higher than other breeds.
 There is no age predilection for development of systemic hypertension, but middle-
aged to older animals are at increased risk for the systemic diseases likely to lead to
systemic hypertension.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Some systemic illnesses have an increased probability of development of systemic
hypertension as a complication.
Dogs:
Acute or chronic renal diseases, especially those associated with proteinuria
Adrenal diseases
Hyperadrenocorticism
■]
Hyperaldosteronism
■Pheochromocytoma
 Sex hormone abnormalities
■ Diabetes mellitus

Cats:
■ Renal disease
■Hyperthyroidism

 Overt abnormalities that may be noted by owner:
■ Acute blindness, hyphema, retinal detachment
■ Depression

■ Blood pressure measurement technique
■Preparation
■ Blood pressure should be measured prior to other diagnostic activities (e.g..
blood sampling, radiographs).
■A period of acclimation (calming, preferably with only mild restraint) of at least
5 to 10 minutes is allowed prior to measurement.
 Choose a indirect (Doppler or oscillometric) blood pressure cuff of a width that
is -40 percent of limb circumference.
■ Place cuff snugly at point of measurement (during measurement, limb or tail
is positioned so that cuff is at the level of heart).
■Tail head (cat or dog. Figure 47.2a)

Hindlimb at metatarsal level (Figure 47.2c)
■ Doppler sphygmomanometric blood pressure measurement (Figure 47.3)
■ Coupling gel is applied to Doppler crystal, which is then applied over the artery
distal to the cuff. The sound generated by blood flow when the Doppler crystal is
in the optimal position should be clear and crisp.
■ The cuff is inflated until the Doppler signal is silenced. The cuff is then slowly
deflated until the Doppler signal is again heard. The pressure (mm Hg) at which

be recorded as the diastolic pressure.
■ Systolic pressure is most reliably estimated by this method. Diastolic pressure can
be difficult to determine accurately in many animals.
■ Five measurements should be taken and averaged for final value.

■ If clinical signs of target organ damage are not present, the following guide may
be used based on systolic blood pressure:
Systolic blood pressure <l50 mm Hg: no therapy required, monitor if possible
causative disease is present
 Systolic blood pressure 150 to 160 mm Hg: if presence of underlying disease is
confirmed, repeat blood pressure measurement at another session to confirm
abnormality. If confirmed systolic blood pressure >150 mm Hg, consider therapy.
■ Systolic blood pressure 160 to 180 mm Hg: confirm with second measurement
session and treat if underlying disease is present
 Systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg: therapy for systemic hypertension is indi-
cated if causative disease is present or strongly suspected
THERAPEUTICS
■Objectives of therapy
■Immediate relief of clinical signs of target organ damage
■Reduction of detected and undetected target organ damage
Drug(s) of Choice
Acute systemic hypertension (clinical signs of target organ damage present)
■ Nitroprusside (intravenous)
■
Potent direct arterial dilator
 Given as continuous rate infusion via an intravenous catheter with fluid pump
■ Continuous blood pressure monitoring (ideally, direct monitoring via indwell-
ing arterial catheter) is recommended.
 Dose (dogs only): 1 to 10μg/kg per minute, start at lowest dose and titrate
according to continuous blood pressure monitoring.
364
Hydralazine (oral)
■ Potent direct arterial dilator
■ Onset of action after oral dosage: approximately 1 to 2 hours
■ Dose (dogs or cats): 0.05 to 4 mg/kg every 12 hours PO, start at lowest dose
and titrate to effect.
■ Chronic systemic hypertension
  o   os s  
hyperthyroidism).
 Efficacy of chronic antihypertensive medications should be confirmed by repeat
changing dosage.
■ Once blood pressure is controlled by chronic antihypertensive medication, blood
pressure should be routine monitored approximately every 3 months.
■Dogs:
■ ACEIs
 First-line drug for all systemic hypertension
 Reduces proteinuria in affected dogs
■ ACEls alone may control mild systemic hypertension adequately but are
unlikely to control severe hypertension as monotherapy.
■Dose:
■ Enalapril: 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours PO
■Benazepril: 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg every 12 to 24 hours PO
 Amlodipine besylate
 Long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist
■]
 Effective, especially in combination with ACEI
■ Dose: 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg every 24 hours PO
■ Spironolactone
■ Aldosterone antagonist
■
 May be helpful as adjunctive medication for control of hypertension
Dose: 1 to 2 mg/kg every 12 hours
■Cats:
■Amlodipine besylate
■ Drug of choice for long term control of systemic hypertension in most
cats
■ Well tolerated by most cats
 Dose: 0.625 mg every 24 hours PO for cats up to 5kg, 1.25 mg every 24 hours
PO for cats >5kg
■ ACEIs
■]
 Less effective as a single agent in cats than in dogs
■
 May be used as adjunctive therapy especially if proteinuria is present
■]
Dose: same as dogs
■Spironolactone
■Aldosterone antagonist
■May be helpful as adjunctive medication for control of hypertension
■Dose: same as dogs
HYPERTENSION
365
β-blocking medications (propranolol, atenolol)
■Atenolol most frequently used to limit heart rate in cats with
hyperthyroidism
■ May be used as adjunctive therapy to control blood pressure
■ Dose: 6.25 to 12.5mg per cat every 12 hours PO
Precautions/Interactions
Hypotension
■ May occur if any medications are overdosed or if dehydration occurs in a patient
receiving antihypertensive medications
 Clinical signs: collapse, weakness, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refll time, and
prerenal azotemia
 Discontinue medication temporarily. Fluid support may be needed until the effects
of the medication subside and dehydration is remedied.
  Close monitoring is required when giving direct arterial dilators.
 ACEls may cause worsening of azotemia if administered to dehydrated animals.
Alternative Drugs
 At this time, no alternative medications or treatments have been proven effective in
control of systemic hypertension in dogs and cats.
Diet
 Although moderate sodium reduction and weight control are likely generally benefi-
cial in aging animals, no particular dietary manipulation has been proven to be
effective in controlling systemic hypertension in dogs and cats.
COMMENTS
 Many disease associated with systemic hypertension can be controlled but not cured
(e.g., renal disease, hyperadrenocorticism); antihypertensive medications in these
patients are likely to be lifelong and may need upward adjustment over time.
appropriate therapy (medical or surgical). Systemic hypertension may resolve after
treatment of underlying disease, but monitoring is required as blood pressure medi-
cations are slowly reduced. In the case of hyperthyroidism, systemic hypertension
may become evident after therapy for the disease.
■ Use of PPA may be associated with systemic hypertension. In dogs in which use of
PPA is indicated, normal blood pressure should first be confirmed by a baseline
measurement. If baseline blood pressure is within normal range, PPA can be initiated
and blood pressure is rechecked approximately 1 to 2 weeks later. If blood pressure
is normal while the patient is receiving PPA, PPA can be continued with blood pres-
sure monitoring approximately every 3 months. If baseline or first recheck blood
pressure is elevated, use of PPA should be avoided.
Client Education
■Control of systemic hypertension is most likely to be successful when blood pressure
medications are giving consistently.
 Optimal treatment of underlying disease is needed in addition to antihypertensive
medications to control systemic hypertension.
■ Successful antihypertensive therapy frequently involves use of multiple medications
and is often lifelong.
Patient Monitoring
■ Blood pressure should be monitored continuously in patients with acute hyperten-
sion associated with target organ damage until blood pressure is controlled.
■ Blood pressure should be assessed within l week of initiation or change in chronic
therapy.
■ Once a patient's blood pressure is stable and underlying disease is controlled, blood
 pressure should be monitored approximately every 3 months.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Cause of death or euthanasia is typically related to the underlying disease rather than
systemic hypertension, but poorly controlled systemic hypertension contributes to
worsening of renal disease and may result in additional complications.

Hypertrophic and Restrictive
Cardiomyopathy
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 HCM is an idiopathic disease of the myocardium characterized by concentric hyper-
trophy and impaired diastolic relaxation. Concentric hypertrophy is a thickened
ventricular wall with a normal to small chamber size, caused by a primary, inherent
problem of the myocardium.
 RCM comprises a diverse group of myocardial conditions including endocardial,
subendocardial, or myocardial fibrosis or other infiltrative disease that results in
decreased ventricular compliance.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Unknown; recent investigations have revealed a genetic origin of HCM in two breeds
of cat, the Maine coon and Ragdoll.
 Concentric hypertrophy causes a noncompliant ventricle and leads to reduced dia-
stolic filling and increased diastolic pressures. Diastolic dysfunction may result in
atrial dilation with congestive heart failure, left atrial thrombi formation with
systemic embolization, impaired myocardial perfusion, myocardial ischemia with
subsequent arrhythmias, dynamic ventricular outflow obstruction, and end-stage
myocardial failure.
 RCM is also characterized by abnormal diastolic function or a restriction of diastolic
flling that results in many of the same pathophysiologic and hemodynamic conse-
quences as HCM.
Systems Affected
 Cardiovascular—Impaired myocardial perfusion, myocardial ischemia with subse-
quent arrhythmias
■  Respiratory—-Tachypnea or cyanosis due to pulmonary edema or pleural effusion
■ Musculoskeletal—Systemic embolization (pelvic limbs most common) resulting in
paresis/paralysis and musculoskeletal pain

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 HCM is considered a primary disease of the myocardium and all other causes for
concentric hypertrophy must be ruled out. Other causes for concentric hypertrophy
include:
■ Systemic hypertension
■Hyperthyroidism
■Aortic stenosis
■Acromegaly (rare in cats)
DIAGNOSTICS
Laboratory Tests
Pleural or abdominal effusion cytology: Modified transudate is most common, but
pure transudate or chylous effusion is also possible.
Thromboembolic disease: Elevations in creatine kinase, enzymes of hepatocellular
damage (i.e., ALI, AST), renal values (i.e., BUN, creatinine), potassium, and cardiac
troponin I; lactate obtained from vein in affected limb(s) is often higher than lactate
concentration in nonaffected limb(s)
Electrocardiography
■Highly variable and nonspecific
■Left axis deviation (partial left bundle branch block)
■ Ventricular or atrial premature complexes or tachyarrhythmias
Thoracic Radiography
Mild to moderate generalized cardiomegaly (Figure 48.1)
■ Left atrial or biatrial enlargement (Figure 48.2)
Interstitial or alveolar infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema

 Pleural effusion
■ Pulmonary vascular distension
Echocardiography
■ Gold standard for antemortem diagnosis
 M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography:
■ HCM
■Left ventricular wall thickness at end-diastole >5.5 mm
■ Papillary muscle hypertrophy
■ SAM of the mitral valve is present in approximately 50 percent of cases.

Pathology
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
 Thickening of the left ventricular myocardium (the interventricular septum and free
wall), with the entire wall commonly being 8- to 1l-mm thick
■ Papillary muscle hypertrophy
■ Smaller than normal left ventricular chamber
Restrictive Cardiomyopathy
 Patchy or diffuse endocardial, subendocardial, or myocardial deposition of fibrous
tissue
■ The endocardium may appear whitish-gray, opaque, and thickened.
THERAPEUTICS
Acute Congestive Heart Failure
 Oxygen supplementation
 Furosemide: 1 to 4 mg/kg IV or IM every 1 to 2 hours initially and then adjusted as
tachypnea resolves (usually 1-2 mg/kg every 6-12 hours); must be used with caution
in patients with concurrent renal disease; hypokalemia can occur as a secondary
complication of furosemide therapy
 Serial renal values and electrolytes
Thoracocentesis as needed to control pleural effusion
Acute Thromboembolic Crisis
 Treatment of congestive heart failure
Analgesia: Use one of the following medications:
 Hydromorphone: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg IV, IM, or SQ every 2 to 6 hours
■Morphine: 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg IM or SQ every 4 to 6 hours
■ Buprenorphine: 0.0l to 0.03 mg/kg IV, IM, or buccally every 6 to 8 hours
■ Fentanyl (2 μg/kg IV, then 3-5 μg/kg per hour IV CRI)
372 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Anticoagulant Therapy
■ Efficacy is unknown in cats.
■  Additional studies are necessary to establish dosage and frequency.
■ Unfractionated heparin: 250 U/kg SQ every 8 hours, aPTT should be prolonged
by one-and-a-half to two times normal.
■ Low-molecular-weight heparins:
■ Enoxaparin: 1 mg/kg SQ every 12 hours
 t  s o1  
■ Aspirin: 5 to 8l mg PO every 72 hours
■
Clopidogrel: 18.75 mg PO every 24 hours
Thrombolytic Therapy
 Tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase: very expensive, severe or fatal com-
plications including reperfusion injury or hemorrhage, no survival benefit compared
to conservative therapy
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure
Diuretics
■Furosemide: 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg PO every 8 to 48 hours
■ Hydrochlorathiazide: 1 to 2mg/kg PO every 12 to 24 hours, typically used with
furosemide in patients refractory to furosemide monotherapy
■ Spironolactone: 1 to 2mg/kg PO every 12 to 24 hours, typically used with
furosemide
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors
■Use only one.
■
 Benazepril: 0.25to 0.05 mg/kg PO every 24 hours
■Enalapril: 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg PO every 12 to 24 hours
Thromboprophylaxis
Recommended in patients after thromboembolic events and for those patients at risk
for systemic emboli
■ Aspirin 5 to 8l mg PO every 72 hours
■ Clopidogrel: 18.75 mg PO every 24 hours
■ β-blockers: never been shown to improve patient outcome, use extreme caution in
patients with congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, hypotension, or bradyar
rhythmias; may be preferred drug choice with systolic anterior motion of mitral valve
■ Atenolol: 6.25 to 12.5 mg PO every 12 to 24 hours, slowly titrated to achieve a heart
rate 140 to 160
HYPERTROPHIC AND RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY
extreme caution in patients with congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, hypo-
tension, or bradyarrhythmias
 Diltiazem: 7.5mg PO every 8 to 12 hours
COMMENTS
Patient Monitoring
■Asymptomatic patients should have echocardiography every 6 to 12 months.
■
 Patients receiving diuretics should be monitored for azotemia and electrolyte abnor-
malities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia).
■After a thromboembolic event, assess for return of limb function, reperfusion injury
(e.g., hyperkalemia), limb necrosis, or self-mutilation.
Prognosis
■ The prognosis for HCM and RCM is generally based on clinical presentation,
echocardiographic and radiographic evidence of elevated diastolic pressures.
          
are believed to have a good long-term prognosis. Asymptomatic cats with marked
left atrial enlargement are at risk for developing heart failure. Cats that present in
heart failure have a poor prognosis with a short survival time (weeks to months).

Hyphema
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
1 Hyphema is the presence of blood in the anterior chamber.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHVSIOLOGY
 Trauma, either blunt or penetrating, is most common cause.
■ Bleeding or clotting disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, inherited clotting deficien-
cies, consumption of clotting factors, liver failure)
Blood dyscrasias (e.g., polycythemia, hyperviscosity)
 Systemic hypertension
■ Uveitis, especially with concurrent vasculitis (e.g., FIP in cats, rickettsial diseases in
dogs)
 Other ocular disease (e.g., neoplasia, retinal detachment, chronic glaucoma, collie
eye anomaly, persistent primary hyperplastic vitreous) generally due to stimulation
 of vascular growth on iris (preiridal fbrovascular membrane)
Systems Affected
■Ophthalmic
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Hyphema can occur in any dog or cat regardless of age, breed, or sex.
 Because there are many causes for hyphema, the signalment and history of the patient
will vary and should be used as a tool to guide the clinician towards a diagnostic
plan.
Historical Findings
■ Many dogs and cats with hyphema will present as an ocular emergency when the
owners notice blood in the eye.
375
 If hyphema is caused by trauma the patient may be presented for signs of acute ocular
pain (e.g.. epiphora and blepharospasm).
 Weight loss, lethargy, or deceased appetite may indicate a systemic cause.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ The clinical features of hyphema will depend on the quantity of blood, whether or
the animal.
■Acute, traumatic hemorrhage will appear bright red (Figure 49.1).
■ If the blood partially fills the anterior chamber and the animal has been inactive
for some time, the blood will settle out in a gravity dependent manner (Figure
49.2).
■Hemorrhage that completely fills the anterior chamber will generally clot within a
few days and turn dark in color (Figure 49.3, “eight ball" hemorrhage).
■ Hyphema associated with infectious disease, such as FIP, will often be mixed with
 inflammatory cells in a fibrin clot. Clots will often localize over the pupil.
■Blood in the anterior chamber may or may not clot. The reasons for this are not well
understood.
■ Intraocular pressure may be elevated.
Figure 49.1 Acute hyphema—blood is dispersed throughout the anterior chamber. The ability to see internal
 Figure 49.2 Blood has settled out into the ventral anterior chamber. The amount of blood is less than one-
third the volume of the anterior chamber and carries a good prognosis for complete resolution.
■Figure 49.3 "Eight ball"hemorrhage in a proptosed globe. The anterior chamber is completely filled with
blood. The prognosis for vision in this eye is grave. Hyphema this extensive generally leads to glaucoma or
phthisis bulbi.
377
8E
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Iris injection/vascularization
■Corneal vascularization or intrastromal corneal hemorrhage
DIAGNOSTICS
■Hyphema is diagnosed by observing blood in the anterior chamber.
 Thorough and detailed history physical and ophthalmic examinations (including
 opposite eye) should be done to rule in/out trauma.
Ophthalmic examination should always include fluorescein staining for corneal
 ulcers and intraocular pressure measurement for secondary glaucoma.
■ Other diagnostic tests should be geared toward the suspected cause of hyphema.
 Minimum data base (i.e., CBC, serum chemistries, urinalysis) for all suspected
systemic causes.
Coagulopathy—Tests to assess hemostasis
 Metastatic neoplasia—Thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound
 Serum titers for suspected infectious disease
■ Ocular ultrasound is indicated when blood prevents complete examination of the
nal) hemorrhage.
Pathological Findings
■ Blood (free or in proteinaceous matrix) is seen in the anterior chamber, iridocorneal
angle, and trabecular meshwork.
Blood or fibrinous adhesions (anterior synechiae) may mechanically occlude the
iridocorneal angle and cause secondary glaucoma.
 Minor to extensive posterior synechiae may be present.
■ Blood staining of the cornea may result with concurrent glaucoma.
■ Fibrovascular membrane over the iris surface is common when hyphema is second-
ary to chronic ocular disease.
THERAPEUTICS
The immediate objectives in the treatment of hyphema are:
Keep the animal quiet to prevent rebleeding (especially when secondary to trauma).
Treat concurrent anterior uveitis.
 Eliminate or manage underlying cause when identified.
■Prevent or treat secondary glaucoma.
HYPHEMA379
Drug(s) of Choice
■Topical 1% prednisolone drops or 0.1% dexamethasone ointment every 6 to 8 hours
hours for concurrent anterior uveitis.
 Topical 1% atropine sulfate drops or cintment every 8 hours until the pupil dilates
 then use to effect. Atropine is used to prevent posterior synechia, pupil obstruction
and iris bombe.
■ Topical 2% dorzolamide drops every 8 hours to decrease aqueous humor formation
if intraocular pressure is elevated.
tPA 25pg injected into the anterior chamber to dissolve formed clots.
■  tPA frequently causes rebleeding and should not be used in the presence of active
hemorrhage or nonclotted blood.
Precautions/Interactions
 The use of topical or systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents is not recom-
mended due to their effect on platelet function.
 Topical glucocorticoids should not be used in the presence of corneal ulceration.
 Topical cintment preparations should not be used if the eye has been perforated.
 Continuous dilation of the pupil with atropine may obstruct aqueous humor outflow
through the iridocorneal angle.
 Close monitoring of the intraocular pressure is recommended when using atropine.
 If intraocular pressure is elevated, atropine is contraindicated unless pressure eleva-
tion is caused by iris bombe.
Activity
■ The activity of the patient should be restricted for several days after hyphema has
occurred. Cage rest or sedation may be necessary.
Surgical Considerations
 Surgery is rarely indicated or performed to treat hyphema.
■ Uncontrolled glaucoma and complete hyphema that has been present for 5 to 10
days can be an indication for invasive surgery to remove the blood clot. Surgery often
results in rebleeding.
■ Uncontrolled glaucoma and complete hyphema carry a poor prognosis for glaucoma
control or vision, enucleation may be required to relieve pain.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■Hyphema often obstructs vision and increases the risk of further injury to the eye.
■ Glaucoma if not already present could develop, especially with moderate to severe
hyphema.
■ Owner should contact veterinarian if signs of pain occur or worsen (i.e., squinting.
tearing. rubbing. lethargy) because this could indicate glaucoma or corneal
ulceration.
■ If pupil is widely dilated, discontinue atropine until pupil begins to constrict again.
■ Emphasize the necessity of treating the underlying cause of hyphema.
Patient Monitoring
■  Monitor underlying disease as recommended.
■  Monitor eyes with moderate to severe hyphema frequently.
■If IOP elevated, recheck daily, additional ocular hypotensive medications may be
necessary.
■ If 1OP in normal range, monitor IOP every 2 to 3 days.
■ Eyes with hyphema <40 percent of anterior chamber should be monitored every 2
to 3 days until resolved.
Possible Complications
■ Chronic glaucoma and pain
■
Blindness
■Phthisis bulbi
■Cataract
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Mild hyphema (<30 percent of anterior chamber filled when blood settles) carries a
good prognosis for vision.
■ Moderate hyphema (30-50 percent of anterior chamber filled when blood settles)
carries a guarded prognosis for vision due to potential of secondary glaucoma.
■ Severe hyphema (>50% of anterior chamber filled when blood settles) carries a poor
prognosis for vision due to intraocular changes and uncontrollable secondary
glaucoma.

Hypotension
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Hypotension is an abnormally low arterial blood pressure, often defined as a mean
 arterial pressure below 60 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressure below 90 mm Hg.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Both cardiac output (volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute) and the
vascular tone, or degree of systemic vascular resistance, contribute to arterial blood
pressure. A dysfunction of either cardiac output or vascular tone or both can result
in hypotension.
 Cardiac output is characterized by lack of venous return (amount of blood returning
to the heart), decreased contractility (strength of myocardial contraction), and after-
load (the pressure against which the heart must pump). A decrease in venous return
or contractility or an increase in afterload will all decrease cardiac output, and poten-
tially lead to hypotension. Anything that causes vasodilation (endotoxemia, hyper-
carbia, anesthetic gases, etc.) can decrease vascular tone and lead to hypotension.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Sepsis—Septic patients are often, but not always, hypotensive. Septic patients will
tend to have an inflammatory leukogram and be hypoglycemic, hypoproteinemic.
and have other clinical signs (i.e., vomiting. infectious nidus, etc.).
1Hypovolemia—Patients who are severely dehydrated or have had blood loss may also
be hypotensive. Hypovolemic patients rapidly respond to appropriate fluid therapy.
Cardiac failure—Patients with myocardial disease who have compromised contractil-
ity may be hypotensive. Any patient with no obvious cause for hypotension should
have a thoracic examination, including auscultation, radiographs, and echocardiog-
raphy to rule out cardiac failure as a cause of hypotension.
 Arrhythmia—Patients with third-degree atrioventricular block or other causes of
bradycardia may suffer collapse and weakness due to inability of the heart to maintain
cardiac output. The blood pressure in these patients is often normal. An ECG should
be checked if the patient is bradycardic.
 Electrolyte disturbances—Acidemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagne-
semia may all complicate existing hypotension and should be ruled out by running
an electrolyte and acid-base profile.
 Anemia—Patients who are anemic without being hypovolemic may present in a
similar condition to hypotensive patients. A complete physical examination, blood
count, biochemistry profle, and evaluation for autoimmune disease should be con-
ducted in cases of suspected anemia. Patients with anemia without blood loss will
tend to have a normal-to-high protein level and will have no identifiable source of
blood loss (i.e.,internal hemorrhage into the chest or abdomen or external
hemorrhage).
 Neurologic disorder—Patients presenting obtunded or depressed should be given a
thorough neurologic examination to rule out presence of neurologic disease. Patients
with neurologic disease but without hypotension should have a normal blood pres-
sure on evaluation.
Hypoxemia—-Patients with respiratory or cardiac illness who have impaired diffusion
of oxygen in the lungs may resemble patients who are hypotensive in being depressed.
weak, and may have pale or blue mucous membranes. Patients who are hypoxemic
are usually normo-to-hypertensive unless a concurrent disease is present. Patients
who are hypoxemic can be diagnosed on the basis of respiratory distress, an abnor
mally low pulse oximeter reading, or on an arterial blood gas analysis.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Indication: any patient presenting after trauma or with signs of depression, sepsis,
lethargy, or any patient under anesthesia
 Doppler method—indirect method using a sphygmomanometer, blood pressure cuff,
and Doppler sound device which gives systolic arterial pressure only
 Automated cuff—indirect method using a circumferential cuff which automatically
inflates and deflates on a periodic basis, giving systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial
pressure
■ Transducer—direct method utilizing an arterial catheter and pressure transducer to
give the gold standard real-time reading of systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial
pressure
Pathological Findings
■ Prolonged hypotension will cause ischemia, which can manifest in any organ.
Ischemia will cause necrosis, and the brain, heart, and kidneys tend to be the most
sensitive organs.
THERAPEUTICS
■ The objective of treatment is to raise mean arterial blood pressure above 60 mm Hg
and diastolic blood pressure above 40 mm Hg. or if no means to measure mean blood
 pressure are available, systolic arterial blood pressure above 90 mm Hg.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Crystalloid fluids: Balanced isotonic crystalloid fluid such as lactated Ringer's.
 Normosol-R, Plasmalyte 60 mL/kg
■Dobutamine 5 to 10μg/kg per minute IV CRI
■ Dopamine 5 to 20μg/kg per minute IV CRI
■Ephedrine 60 μg/kg IV
Precautions/Interactions
 Any drug that has the potential to cause or worsen hypotension should be used cau-
S     o       
includes most anesthetic agents, some antibiotics if given rapidly, and drugs that
cause vasodilation (nitroglycerine, nitroprusside, ACE inhibitors).
Alternative Drugs
■ Phenylephrine 1 to 3μg/kg per minute CRI
■
 Norepinephrine 0.05 to 3μg/kg per minute CRI
■ Vasopressin 0.5 to5 mU/kg per minute CRI
■ Epinephrine 0.0l to 0.1 μg/kg per minute CRI
Activity
■ Patients typically will be too weak to be active. Because many of the medications
require continuous intravenous access, limiting patient movement while in a treat-
ment cage may be helpful.
HYPOTENSION387
Surgical Considerations
 Anesthesia should generally be avoided in patients who have existing hypotension.
or the hypotension should be resolved before anesthesia. If surgery is necessary to
should be stabilized and blood-pressure-sparing anesthetic agents such as benzodi-
dissociatives (e.g., ketamine) should be used. Etomidate is a very cardiovascularly
friendly induction agent that can be combined with a benzodiazepine for rapid anes-
thetic induction. Use of etomidate alone can cause clonus. Etomidate (0.5-l mg/kg
IV) also can depress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, so administration of
physiologic doses of glucocorticosteroids should be administered at the time of
induction and again 24 hours later when etomidate has been used.
COMMENTS
Blood flow is determined in part by blood pressure and is the true variable of interest
in hypotension. Drugs that increase vascular tone (e.g., phenylephrine, ephedrine.
epinephrine) will increase blood pressure, but this may be at the cost of peripheral
blood flow and perfusion. These drugs should be used cautiously to improve blood
pressure in hypotension.
Client Education
 A patient with hypotension should not be discharged
 Patient Monitoring
■ Blood pressure should be monitored at least every 5 minutes during anesthesia or in
emergent situations. For long-term treatment, blood pressure should be checked
every 15 minutes for the first hour, then hourly thereafter if the patient is critical or
every 6 hours once the patient is stable.
Possible Complications
■ Possible clinical sequelae to hypotension include cerebral damage (especially blind-
ness) and renal damage. These are typically noted before discharge. The owners
should be informed that they should have regular bloodwork to ensure that the
animal does not develop early onset chronic renal failure due to the hypotensive
episode(s).
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Hypotension typically resolves rapidly with definitive treatment (such as fluids in
a hypovolemic patient) and usually responds immediately to the drug treatments
previously described.
■ Most patients that develop mild hypotension under anesthesia suffer no long-term
consequences
■Severe hypotension can cause cerebral and renal damage.
■ In some cases, particularly severe sepsis, patients may not respond to initial drug
 treatments and more aggressive medications (given in alternative treatments) will be
necessary.

tions (e.g., acidosis, hypocalcemia, anemia). In patients who do not respond to initial

Hypothermia
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■Defined as a decrease in normal body temperature (37.8-39.2° C or 100.0-102.5° F)
to below 37° C (99° F)
■Mild hypothermia: 32 to 37° C (90-99° F)
■Moderate hypothermia: 28 to 32° C (82-90° F)
■ Severe hypothermia: below 28° C (82° F)
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Under normal circumstances, the body produces heat as a byproduct of metabolic
processes. Body heat is centered around the core, and by the process of thermoregu-
lation, heat can be dissipated from the skin and respiratory tract. Activation of the

metabolism in an attempt to produce heat and rewarm the body.
 Even during some stages of mild hypothermia, when the body temperature drops to
below 93° F, adverse consequences such as peripheral vasodilation, decreased cel-
lular metabolism, and decreased heat production occur. As hypothermia progresses

Systems Affected
■ Hepatic—decreased hepatic enzyme activity
■Renal/Urologic—increased glomerular filtration rate and diuresis, decreased sensitiv-
ity to antidiuretic hormone, fluid loss/dehydration; decreased renal blood flow, renal
hypoxia, renal tubular necrosis
Coagulation—coagulopathies including decreased platelet aggregation, decreased
thromboxane A2 and decreased coagulation factor activity. Predisposition to DIC
due to sequestration of platelets in the reticuloendothelial system in the liver and
spleen.
Cardiovascular—mild tachycardia with mild hypothermia, vasoconstriction can

output, and hypotension. Atrial and ventricular fibrillation can occur with severe
hypothermia.
■ Respiratory—decreased tidal volume and respiratory rate, decreased minute ventila-
tion, hypoxia
malities can range in severity from depression and weakness to stupor or coma.
■Immune system—decreased immune function secondary to decreased neutrophil
activation, phagocytic capacity, chemotaxis; decreased cytokine, and antibody pro-
duction. Can lead to increased risk of infection and delayed wound healing
■ Metabolic—decreased off-loading of oxygen in peripheral tissues due to left-shift of
the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis
■ In animals with severe hypothermia, it may be very difficult to differentiate

DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Chemistry/Urinalysis
 Usually normal
■ Some patients may exhibit hyperglycemia and mild hemoconcentration.
Other Laboratory Tests
■ Coagulation tests—thrombocytopenia, prolonged ACT, aPTT, and PT
 Endocrine—Decreased T4 with concomitant elevation in eTSH may reveal true
hypothyroidism versus euthyroid sick syndrome associated with other underlying
illnesses.
Diagnostic Procedures
ture and rewarming.
Electrocardiography
■ Sinus bradycardia with prolonged PR, QRS, and RT intervals
May see atrial fibrillation
Ventricular dysrhythmias is common.
Premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular
fibrillation may be observed as hypothermia becomes progressively worse.
THERAPEUTICS
■  In-patient therapy is recommended until temperature, acid-base and electrolyte
status, and correction of underlying cause of hypothermia have been resolved.
■ Body temperature may initially decrease further during early stages of rewarming
due to improved circulation of the peripheral tissues, vasodilation, and mixing of
blood from the core to the cooler periphery.
■ Goal is to provide ambient rewarming measures without promoting further loss of
heat.
■ Oxygen supplementation and endotracheal intubation are both necessary in obtunded
 patients. In most severe cases, mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
HYPOTHERMIA
■Passive rewarming with insulated blankets
■ Active rewarming with external heat sources such as forced warm air blankets or
circulating warm water blankets or pads
 Plastic bubble wrap or cellophane on limbs to prevent heat loss from feet, particularly
during anesthetic procedures
Core rewarming techniques such as warm peritoneal, gastric, or urinary lavage; warm
water enemas, warm intravenous fluids, and warmed airway air
Drug(s) of Choice
 Oxygen supplementation: 50 to 150 ml/kg per minute
■Isotonic crystalloid fluids
Contraindications
1Avoid lactated Ringer's solution with severe hypothermia because lactate requires
hepatic metabolism.
COMMENTS
Patient Monitoring
■Monitor core body temperature very closely during rewarming.
 Monitor ECG and blood pressure.
■Frostbite
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Avoid prolonged exposure to cold temperatures.
■ Use warm water blankets or forced warm air blankets during anesthetic
procedures.
Possible Complications
■ Increased metabolic rate and shivering
 Increased cellular oxygen demand
 Thermal burns from inappropriate rewarming measures such as heating pads
 After drop phenomenon: core temperature of patient continues to fall during rewarm-
ing (passive and active)
 Rewarming shock: rapid vasodilation during rewarming that results in severe venous
pooling: ideally, avoid warming body temperature more than 1° F per hour

Hypoxemia
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Hypoxemia is defined as aPaO of less than 80 mm Hg.
 Clinically significant desaturation of hemoglobin occurs at a PaO, < 60 mm Hg and
warrants rapid intervention.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 The five causes of hypoxemia are:
■Low FiO
■Hypoventilation
■ Mismatching of alveolar ventilation and pulmonary perfusion
■
 Right-to-left cardiac or intrapulmonary shunting
Alveolar-capillary membrane diffusion defect.
 Conditions that result in hypoxemia result from one or more of these causes.
■ Low FiOHigh altitudes have lower barometric pressures than at sea level
and, subsequently, offer lower partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen. Patients
attached to a breathing circuit (anesthetic circuit, ventilator) or in an enclosed
environment (oxygen cage) could accidentally be exposed to air with a lower
FiOz.
■ Hypoventilation—Conditions associated with central respiratory depression (CNS
disease or an anesthetic overdose) or those affecting the respiratory apparatus
(upper airway obstruction, restriction of the thoracic cage from pleural space
disease, neuromuscular disease, thoracic trauma, diaphragmatic hernia, ascites or
severe gastric dilation) can all cause decreased alveolar ventilation.
V/Q mismatch:
■ V/Q mismatch occurs along a spectrum: on one end alveoli are perfused but not
ventilated (low V/Q mismatch). Diseases that create partial filling of alveoli
with fluid (i.e., pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary contusions, neoplasia)
or partial obstruction of the terminal airways (i.e., bronchitis) result in regions
of impaired gas exchange. On the other end of the spectrum, the alveoli are
ventilated but not perfused, resulting in pure dead space ventilation (high
V/Q mismatch). Patients with pulmonary thromboembolism represent this
group.
568
Right-to-left cardiac or intrapulmonary shunting:
■ Physiological right-to-left shunts occur when areas of the lung that are completely
unventilated (V/Q = 0) due lung lobe consolidation (from pneumonia, atelectasis,
edema, neoplasia) care unable to contribute to gas exchange. The deoxygenated
blood coming from these unventilated areas of the lung dilutes the arterial partial
oxygen pressure and results in hypoxemia. Pathological anatomical shunts are
associated with abnormal communication between right and left sides of the cir-
culation (right- to left-sided shunting ventricular septal defects, right- to left-sided
shunting patent ductus arteriosus).
 Alveolar-capillary membrane diffusion defect:
■ Diseases that decrease the area or increase the thickness of this gas exchange
membrane (e.g., pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis)
Systems Affected
■ CNs—Cerebral hypoxia can result in irreversible brain damage.
■ Gastrointestinal—Susceptible to bacterial translocation during periods of hypoxia.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Brachycephalic breeds may be more susceptible to hypoxemia secondary to upper
airway obstruction.
 West Highland White terriers and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Westie lung disease)
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Bronchopneumonia, pleural space disease, trauma, anesthesia, prolonged recum-
 bency, cardiac disease, neuromuscular disorders, structural or dynamic upper airway
obstruction (e.g., brachycephalic airway syndrome, laryngeal paralysis).
Historical Findings
■ The owners may describe increased respiratory rate and effort, cyanosis, coughing.
gagging, trauma, exercise intolerance, or collapse.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Tachypnea, orthopnea, sitting with head and neck extended, restlessness, open
mouth breathing, stridor, stertor, nasal flare, cyanotic or pale mucous membranes.
coughing, bronchial sounds or crackles and wheezes on auscultation, tachycardia.
heart murmurs, arrhythmias and pulse deficits.

bronchopneumonia dislodge and excrete pulmonary exudates.
Surgical Considerations
■ For dogs showing early signs consistent with brachycephalic syndrome, widening
the nostrils and shortening the soft palate may confer a long-term favorable prognosis
of avoiding complications associated with brachycephalic airway syndrome.
COMMENTS
■ Use minimal restraint with handling.
■
 Provide supplemental oxygen.
■  Remember the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve when handling any patient with
respiratory distress and hypoxemia. (See Figure 52.1.)
Client Education
■ Owners should be instructed to monitor respiratory rate and effort when their
animals are at rest.
■ Check for cyanotic mucous membranes.
Patient Monitoring
 n    (  as r sa a 
assessed by physical examination findings associated with a more comfortable and
less anxious patient: reduced respiratory rate and effort, decreased tachycardia and
improvement of cyanotic mucous membranes (if present initially).
 Effectiveness of oxygen therapy can be accurately assessed by repeating arterial blood
 gas analysis and comparing trends based on the alveolar and PaOz gradients. Pulse
oximetry can be also be used for continual assessment while on oxygen support and
without it.
Prevention/Avoidance
■Weight loss for overweight patients.
■Activity restriction during hot weather.
■  Early corrective surgery for brachycephalic breeds.
Possible Complications
■ Exposure to 60 percent FiO, or greater for more than 24 hours can produce signs
of oxygen toxicity due to the formation of oxygen-derived free radical species and
subsequent pulmonary damage.

Immune-Mediated Hemolytic
Anemia (IMHA)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 IMHA is a type II hypersensitivity reaction resulting from the production of anti-
erythrocyte antibodies that accelerate the destruction or removal of erythrocytes from
circulation.
 IMHA can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to medication or disease.
■]
 Immunosuppression is the backbone of therapy Additional therapy includes sup-
portive care and treatment of any underlying condition.
 Response to therapy is variable. Mortality is related to refractory anemia, thrombo-
embolism (usually pulmonary), or adverse effects of therapy.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Anti-erythrocyte antibodies form against normal  erythrocyte surface antigens
(primary IMHA) or against altered erythrocyte surface antigens (secondary IMHA).
1 Cause of secondary IMHA include:
Tick-borne disease (ehrlichiosis), babesiosis, mycoplasmosis, cytauxzoonosis
■ Viral disease—FeLV, FIV, FIP
■Neoplasia (especially lymphoma)
■
 Drugs—cephalosporins, methimazole, propylthiouracil
Live virus vaccination
■
Heartworm disease
■Bacterial infection: leptospirosis, bacterial endocarditis
1  Antibodies or complement deposition on erythrocyte membranes results in either
direct intravascular hemolysis or accelerated extravascular removal of the erythrocyte
by the mononuclear phagocytic system in the spleen, liver, and/or bone marrow.
Extravascular hemolysis is most common.
 Autoagglutination of erythrocytes occurs when IgM or high titers of IgG cause inter-
erythrocytic bridging.
The anemia of IMHA is usually regenerative. It may be nonregenerative early in the
course of disease (2-5 days), if concurrent disease (e.g., renal failure) precludes
regeneration, or if the targeted cell is an erythrocyte precursor, and results in the
destruction of immature erythrocytes in the marrow.
401
402
■ IMHA can occur alone, or in combination with other immune-mediated disease
(IMT, SLE).
■ IMHA is relatively common in dogs; in many cases, an underlying or predisposing
cause is not identified. It is uncommon in cats, and is usually secondary to underly.
ing disease.
Systems Affected
■ Hemolymphatic—Destruction or removal of erythrocytes resulting in anemia, pro-
duction and release of proinflammatory mediators, DIC, thrombocytopenia, hyper-
coagulable state, and resultant thrombosis.
■ Hepatobiliary—Prehepatic  icterus, hyperbilirubinemia, and bilirubinuria are
common. Elevated liver enzymes can occur secondary to anemia.
■ Cardiovascular—Tachycardia due to hypoxia; murmurs can occur as a result of
 decreased blood viscosity and turbulent blood flow; chronic anemia may precipitate
high output heart failure.
■Respiratory——Hypoxia,
tachypnea
secondary
toanemiaor
pulmonary
thromboembolism.
■ Renal/urinary—Pigmenturia  with  intravascular hemolysis; severe  intravascular
hemolysis may cause tubular damage.

■ Biochemical profile
■Hyperbilirubinemia or hemoglobinemia
■ Elevated hepatic enzymes
■Urinalysis:
■ Hemoglobinuria or bilirubinuria
■ In-saline agglutination test:
■
Agglutination persists after addition of one to two drops of normal saline to one
drop fresh or EDTA-anticoagulated blood on a glass slide.
A negative test does not exclude a diagnosis of IMHA.
■ Direct Coombs' test:
■ Detects the presence of autoantibodies or complement on erythrocyte surface.
■ Test is positive in 35 to 60 percent of dogs with IMHA; a negative test does not
exclude a diagnosis of IMHA.
■ False-positive tests can occur with previous transfusions, as well as some infec-
tious diseases, drugs, or neoplasia.
Coagulation testing (platelet count, PT, PTT, D-dimers):
Usually normal.
■ Marked thrombocytopenia may indicate concurrent IMT.
■ Mild thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimers, or elevated PTT may indicate con-
sumption (DIC or thrombosis).
■ Imaging (radiography, ultrasonography):
■
Splenomegaly, or hepatosplenomegaly
■
 Thorax usually normal; may be evidence of PTE
 Bone marrow evaluation:
Indicated if nonregenerative anemia, marked thrombocytopenia or leucopenia
  Usually reveals erythroid hyperplasia; if anemia nonregenerative, may reveal mat-
uration arrest or erythroid hypoplasia.
■Erythrophagocytosis sometimes evident.
■ Other diagnostic testing should be aimed at ruling out differential diagnoses, and
identifying (or ruling out) an underlying cause for IMHA. May include:
■ Serology and PCR. Dogs: ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, leptospirosis. Cats: FeLV, FIV,
Mycoplasma haemofelis, with or without ehrlichiosis.
 Bacterial culture of any potential infections.
THERAPEUTICS
■The objectives of therapy are:
 Suppression of immune-mediated hemolysis, and reversal of anemia
Treatment of underlying disease, if present
 Support of the patient through the anemic crisis
 Prevention of catastrophic consequences (e.g., thromboembolism)
Gradual weaning of therapy over subsequent months such that remission is
sustained.

Dogs
■ Azathioprine (2mg/kg PO every 24 hours). Decrease frequency to every 48 horus
after glucocorticoid discontinuation, or if a decrease in white blood cell count. Note:
May take 2 to 4 weeks to effect.
■Cyclosporine (5 mg/kg PO every 12 hours)
■ Mycophenolate mofetil (10-20 mg/kg PO every 12 hours)
Cats
Cyclosporine (5mg/kg PO every 12 hours)
 In cases that relapse with dose reduction of glucocorticoids, the clinician should
consider changing to, or adding, another immunosuppressive agent.
Blood transfusion:
     s   s    
transfuse should be based on patient's clinical signs, not merely PCV
 Packed red blood cells (l0ml/kg. over 4 hours) are indicated if severe
anemia.
408 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ If packed red blood cells are not available, transfusion with whole blood
(20ml/kg over 4 hours) or a hemoglobin-based oxygen solution (Oxyglobin,
10-30 ml/kg over 4-8 hours) is an acceptable alternative.
 All cats must be typed or cross-matched prior to blood transfusion to ensure a com-
patibility. Cross-matches should be performed with any subsequent transfusions in
dogs and cats. If an animal is autoagglutinating. a cross-match procedure cannot be
performed. However, there are blood typing kits available that can be performed on
blood that is saline agglutination positive (IVD Scientific Service Laboratory, www.
alvediavet.com)
  Thromboprophylaxis (dogs):
 Ultra-low dose aspirin (0.5 mg/kg PO every 24 hours)
■ If thromboembolism is present: low molecular weight heparin or heparin CRI
protocol.
■ Gastroprotectants:
■H, receptor antagonsts while on high-dose glucocorticoids
■ Sucralfate with or without proton pump inhibitor if suspected gastrointestinal
ulceration
 Intravenous fluid therapy if indicated for dehydration or hypoperfusion.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Avoid medications associated with secondary IMHA or bone marrow suppression,
as well as therapies that cause immune stimulation (e.g., vaccines).
■ Do not use azathioprine in cats
■  If using azathioprine, monitor liver enzymes and CBC regularly
Alternative Drugs
■ Intravenous human immunoglobulin (0.5-1.5 g/kg IV infusion over 6-12 hours) has
been suggested for patients with refractory IMHA, and those with aggressive hemo-
lysis or autoagglutination. Effect can be rapid, but sustained immunosuppression is
unlikely. Administered together with glucocorticoids with or without adjunctive
immunosuppressive therapy.
Activity
■ Enforced restricted activity until stable
Surgical Considerations
 Splenectomy may be considered for cases refractory to medical management. This is
generally reserved for patients that fail to achieve sustained remission following
multiple combination immunosuppressive regimens.

COMMENTS
Client Education
■IMHA and associated complications may be fatal.
 The patient will need to be on medications for months. In some cases, lifelong treat-
ment is necessary.
 Relapses and recurrences are possible.
Regular recheck visits will be necessary. adding to the financial and time
commitment.
 There are likely to be clinical adverse effects of corticosteroids; these will diminish
as the dose is decreased, and will abate when drug is discontinued.
■ Monitor for signs of recurrent anemia, thromboembolism (e.g., tachypnea, respira-
tory distress), or adverse drug reactions (e.g., inappetence, lethargy melena,
pollakiuria).
■Live virus vaccination and drugs associated with secondary IMHA should be avoided.

Signs of thromboembolism—tachypnea, respiratory distress, abdominal effusion
Adverse effects of therapy (e.g., volume overload, transfusion reaction)
■ PCV every 4 to 12 hours, depending on rate of change.
Outpatient Monitoring
■ CBC—weekly until normal, then every other week for 2 to 3 months, then monthly
until 3 months following discontinuation of drugs. If any evidence of relapse, increase
frequency.
■ Azathioprine—CBCs as noted, chemistry profle (liver parameters) monthly or if

■
 Acute renal failure
■Death
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Initial response (slowing of hemolysis, increase in PCV) is usually seen within 7
days; normalization of PCV may take weeks.
■ Response is significantly slower in patients with nonregenerative anemia; it does not
warrant a poorer prognosis.
■ A poorer prognosis is associated with intravascular hemolysis, serum bilirubin con-
centration >5 mg/dl, hypoalbuminemia, and severe thrombocytopenia.
■ Mortality varies with severity of disease, and ranges from 25 to 80 percent.
■
 Thromboembolism is a significant potential consequence, with reported prevalence
of 30 to 80 percent.
■ Patients that survive the acute crisis and leave the hospital have a relatively good
prognosis.
■ Patients need to be on immunosuppressive therapy for months.
■  Relapse can occur with tapering of therapy, and is an indication for adjustment of
 the immunosuppressive therapy protocol.
■Recurrence is possible.

Intussusception
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Gastrointestinal intussusception is the telescoping or prolapsing of one portion of
the gastrointestinal tract into the lumen of an adjoining part of intestine or
stomach. This occurs most commonly in the jejunum (Figure 54.1) or at the ileo-
colic junction, although gastroesophageal or pylorogastric intussusceptions are
susceptum, the prolapsed portion, and the distal (aborad) intussuscipiens, the
receiving portion. Reverse and multiple intussusceptions may also occur. Sliding
intussusceptions (those that occur and then reduce spontaneously) have also been
reported.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Intussusceptions are often associated with gastroenteritis attributed to intestinal
parasitism, focal and linear foreign bodies, intestinal mass, dietary indiscretion,
or viral infection. Previous abdominal surgery has also been suspected as a
causative factor, although in the majority of cases of intussusception the cause is
unknown.
Systems Affected
1  Gastrointestinal—Intussusceptions may cause a complete or partial obstruction and
result in vomiting, melena, or hematochezia. Inappetence and weight loss may occur
with chronic or sliding intussusceptions. The tissue involved in the intussusception
may become devitalized and result in gastrointestinal necrosis and leakage into the
abdominal cavity.
 Cardiovascular—-Intussusceptions that result in complete gastrointestinal obstruc-
tion, breakdown of the mucosal barrier, or wall necrosis have the high likelihood of
causing hypovolemic and septic shock.
 Respiratory—Animals with acute gastroesophageal intussusception may present in
severe respiratory distress due to the presence of the gas-distended stomach within
the thoracic cavity or due to aspiration pneumonia from severe vomiting.
413
414
 Figure 54.1 A jejunojejunal intussusception in a 10-week old Weimaraner
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Intussusceptions occur in both dogs and cats and seem to predominantly affect
younger animals less than l year of age. German shepherd dogs and Siamese cats
may be overrepresented, although intussusceptions can occur in any breed. There
does not appear to be a gender predisposition.
■ Clinical signs associated with intussusception are influenced by location, complete-
ness, and duration of obstruction. Acute intussusceptions have a history most con-
sistent with an acute abdomen: vomiting. bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
 Animals with chronic intussusceptions may have clinical signs that are vaguer: inap-
petence, weight loss, and diarrhea.
■ Historical information may be valuable in aiding the diagnosis of intussusception
because many animals will have a recent history of illness, abdominal surgery, or
environmental change.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Physical examination may reveal a guarded painful abdomen.
■ Often an elongated large tubular structure can be palpated within the abdomen,
representing a thickened loop of intestine.
■Occasionally, the intussusceptum may protrude through the anus mimicking a rectal
prolapse.
INTUSSUSCEPTION

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Focal gastrointestinal foreign bodies
 Linear gastrointestinal foreign bodies
■ Intestinal volvulus
■ Gastroenteritis
DIAGNOSTICS
 Survey abdominal radiographs—Plain abdominal radiographs may have variable
signs. A large soft tissue tubular structure may be visualized. Incomplete obstruc-
tions do not usually result in gas accumulation within the intestinal lumen.
A barium enema or pneumocolonogram may help with diagnosis of ileocolic
intussusceptions.
■Abdominal ultrasound—This modality is particularly useful in identifying intussus-
ceptions. In a transverse plane, intussusceptions appear as a multilayered target-like
nal plane, there are alternating hyperechoic and hypoechoic parallel lines (Figure
54.2). Although the “target sign" or “bulls-eye" is considered to be pathognomonic
 Figure 54.2 A transverse ultrasound image of an ileocolic intussusception demonstrating the classic target
sign appearance.
416 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
for intestinal intussusception, care must be taken to visualize the structure in mul-
tiple planes to avoid misdiagnosis. A recent case report describes how healthy intes-
P      d  s a
target-like appearance in some imaging planes.
 Laboratory findings may include electrolyte abnormalities, acid-base disturbances,
anemia, hypoalbuminemia, stress or inflammatory leukograms, and evidence of
dehydration.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Although spontaneous reduction of intestinal intussusception is possible, surgical
intervention is the treatment of choice. Prior to surgery, the animal's hemodynamic
and electrolyte status should be stabilized, although surgery should not be delayed
unnecessarily. Although intestinal resection may or may not be required, prophylac-
tic antibiotics are indicated as the viability of the intestine is unknown and because
there is increased infection risk with intestinal obstruction due to mucosal break-
down with potential bacterial overgrowth and translocation.
Surgical Considerations
■ The objective of surgery is to reestablish a patent gastrointestinal tract either
through reduction of the intussusception or by resection of the affected segment.
Reduction of the intussusception should be attempted by placing gentle traction
on the intussusceptum while gently pushing on the intussuscipiens. If reduced.
the involved portion of the intestine is evaluated for perforations, necrosis, or
other signs of poor viability. Subjective measures utilized to assess intestinal
viability include color, thickness, peristalsis, and arterial pulsation. Resection
due to vascular compromise, devitalized tissue, intestinal perforation, and
adhesions
■ Controversy exists over whether measures should be taken to prevent recurrence of
intestinal intussusception. This is accomplished through enteroplication (or entero-
enteropexy), which is the creation of permanent serosal adhesions between adjacent
segments of small intestine (Figure 54.3). To perform this procedure, gentle loops
of small intestine from the duodenocolic ligament to the ileocolic junction are placed
side by side and secured in this formation with variably spaced simple interrupted
partial-thickness sutures using 4-0 absorbable monofilament material. Care must
be taken to avoid abrupt angles of the intestinal loops to minimize the risk of
postoperative intestinal obstruction. Both intussusception recurrence and severe
the dog and cat.

■Figure 54.3 Intraoperative photograph showing the small intestine gently looped in preparation of
enteroplication
COMMENTS
Possible Complications
■ The risk of possible complications from enteroplication must be weighed against the
risk of possible recurrence. At this time, the only study investigating this problem
 found that there is similar likelihood (approximately 20 percent) between these two
scenarios. Therefore, it is left to the discretion of the veterinarian whether entero-
plication is to be performed.
Expected Course and Prognosis
The prognosis for animals with intussusceptions is dependent on the location and
completeness of the obstruction, as well as the duration of the condition. Rapid
recognition and treatment contribute to improved survival. However, the prognosis
worsens with intestinal perforation and peritonitis. Recent studies report successful
outcomes in over 80 percent of cases.

Immune-Mediated
Thrombocytopenia (lMT)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 An immune-mediated disease that results from the development of antiplatelet anti-
bodies that accelerate destruction and/or removal of platelets from circulation. IMT
can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to medication or disease.
 Diagnosis is aimed at the elimination of other potential causes for thrombocytopenia,
and the identification of underlying disease.
Morbidity and mortality are related to bleeding: this can be massive, or into a vital
organ (e.g., brain, lungs).
 Immunosuppression is the backbone of therapy. Additional therapy includes sup-
portive care and treatment of any underlying condition.
Response to treatment is generally rapid. If the patient survives the initial period
until platelet count increases, long-term prognosis is relatively good.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 IgG antibodies bind to platelet surfaces and result in accelerated platelet destruction
and removal.
■ Primary (idiopathic) IMT results from antibodies directed against normal platelet
surface antigens. This can occur alone, or in combination with other immune-
mediated disease (i.e., IMHA, SLE).
1 Secondary IMT occurs when antibodies target non-self-antigens that have been
adsorbed onto the platelet surface or when immune complexes bind to platelet
surface. Causes include:
■Tick-borne disease (ehrlichiosis), Rocky Mountain spotted fever, bartonellosis
■ Viral disease—FeLV, FIV
 Neoplasia (especially lymphoma)
■
 Drugs—-potentiated sulfonamides
■ Live virus vaccination
■Heartworm disease
■ Chronic bacterial infection

■ Significant thrombocytopenia (<40,000-50,000/μl) results in spontaneous bleeding.
particularly in the skin and mucosal surfaces.
■  IMT is relatively common in dogs. It is uncommon in cats, and is usually secondary
to underlying disease (often viral).
■ Secondary IMT may have a higher incidence in areas where associated infectious
diseases are endemic.
Systems Affected
■ Hemic/Lymphatic/Immune —destruction or removal of platelets (thrombocytope-
nia), anemia (if bleeding or concomitant IMHA), and production and release of
proinflammatory mediators may result in DlC.
■ Cardiovascular—failure of primary hemostasis results in bleeding, usually mani-
fested as petechiae or ecchymoses, especially of skin and mucosal surfaces.
 Skin—-petechiae/ecchymoses.(Figures 55.1 and 55.2)
 Gastrointestinal—hemorrhage, hematemesis, melena.
■
Urologic—-urinary hemorrhage/hematuria.
■H
epistaxis.
■ Eyes—scleral or retinal hemorrhage, hyphema (Figure 55.3).
■Nervous—-intracranial hemorrhage, seizures.

■Associated underlying diseases
Historical Findings
■ Lethargy, depression, inappetence, weakness

Hyphema, retinal/scleral hemorrhage
Epistaxis
■Melena, hematochezia
■Hematuria
■ Tachypnea, adventitious lung sounds
■ CNS signs, including changes in consciousness and localized deficits
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
IMT must be differentiated from other causes of thrombocytopenia. These include:
■ Decreased platelet production
■ Pure megakaryocytic hypoplasia (platelets only)—vaccination (i.e., panleukope-
nia), viral (i.e., FeLV, FIV), estrogen toxicity, phenobarbital toxicity
IMMUNE-MEDIATED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (IMT)
423
  Panhypoplasia (including other blood cell lines)—myelophthisis, myelofibrosis,
hematopoietic neoplasia, infectious disease (i.e., FeLV, FIP, FIV, chronic ehrlichi-
osis, sepsis), or drug associated (i.e., chemotherapy, griseofulvin, methimazole,
albendazole)
 Dysthrombopoiesis—myelodysplastic syndromes
1Increased platelet consumption or sequestration:
■ DIC
■Profound, acute hemorrhage
 Splenic torsion
■Vasculitis
■ Microangiopathy—hemangiosarcoma, splenic disease
■ Nonimmune platelet destruction:
■ Viral——FeLV, FIV, FIP, parvovirus
■ Rickettsial, protozoal—ehrlichiosis, hemobartonellosis, cytauxzoonosis
■ Bacterial—-bacteremia, leptospirosis, salmonellosis
■ Fungal—histoplasmosis, disseminated candidiasis
■ Snake envenomation
1  Normal breed variation:
■  Low platelet counts can be normal in greyhounds, Cavalier King Charles spaniels
and Shiba Inus.
■Spurious
■ Platelet clumping due to errors in collection or handling will result in artificially
low platelet counts.
■ A markedly decreased platelet count (<50,000/μul) in the absence of other cell line
anomalies (nonregenerative anemia, leukopenia) is suggestive of IMT.
DIAGNOSTICS
Platelet Count
■ Should be performed in any patient with a possible bleeding disorder.
■ Counts can be performed manually (hemocytometer) or via automated counters in
dogs. Automated platelet counting is inaccurate in cats; platelet counts must be
performed manually.
Blood Srmear Evaluation
■ Indicated where platelet count is not immediately available and to verify findings of
platelet counts.
■ The smear should be carefully examined for platelet clumps, which preclude an
accurate count.
■ A platelet count can be estimated by multiplying the average platelet count per high
power field (100x) by 15,000.
 Large platelets are suggestive of regeneration in dogs.
Complete Blood Count
Thrombocytopenia invariably present; usually marked (<50,000/μul)
■Anemia may be present if bleeding or concurrent IMHA. Usually regenerative; may
be nonregenerative if early (<3-5 days) or concurrent disease precludes
regeneration.
■Neutrophilia sometime present.
Biochemical Profile
■ No specific abnormalities; abnormalities may reflect underlying disease.
Coagulogram (PT, aPTT, D-dimers)
■ Should be performed to rule out consumptive coagulopathy
■ Normal with IMT.
Thoracic Radiographs
■ Indicated if respiratory compromise, or if potential for underlying neoplasia.
■No specific abnormalities; may be suggestive of pulmonary hemorrhage or underly.
ing neoplasia.
Bone Marrow Evaluation
  Ideally should be performed in all cases, except where a consumptive platelet disor-
der is evident.
 Is definitely indicated with refractory thrombocytopenia, if multiple cell lines affected
(i.e., leukopenia, nonregenerative anemia), or if atypical cells are evident on blood
smear cytology.
■ Megakaryocytic hyperplasia indicates platelet destruction and is typical (but not
pathognomonic) for IMT. Megakaryocytic hypoplasia can occur in some cases of IMT
if antibodies are directed against early precursors. It is, however, unusual, and other
causes for decreased platelet production should be pursued.
Other Laboratory Tests
■ Other diagnostic testing should be aimed at ruling out differential diagnoses and
identifying (or ruling out) an underlying cause for IMT:
■Abdominal ultrasonography
■ Serology for viral or tick-borne disease. Dogs: Ehrlichiosis, bartonellosis, Rocky
Mountain Spotted Fever. Cats: FeLV, FIV, with or without ehrlichiosis.
■ Bacterial culture of any potential infections.
IMMUNE-MEDIATED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (IMT)
THERAPEUTICS
The objectives of therapy are:
■ Suppression of the immune system and thus the immune-mediated platelet
destruction, such that platelet numbers normalize
■ Ireatment of underlying disease, if present
■ Support of the patient through the bleeding crisis
■Prevention of catastrophic hemorrhage
■ Gradual weaning of therapy over subsequent months such that remission is
sustained.
■ Inpatient care is indicated with severe thrombocytopenia (<40,000/μl), active bleed-
ing, inability to tolerate oral medication, or development of complications (pulmo-
nary or CNS hemorrhage).
■Restrict venipuncture, and avoid phlebotomy from central veins.
■Minimize risk of bleeding through careful handling.
Outpatient care when risk of bleeding is decreased (platelet count >40,000/ul)
anemia is stabilized, and oral medications are tolerated.
Drug(s) of Choice
Glucocorticoids
■ Prednisone/prednisolone. Small dogs and cats: 1 to 2 mg/kg PO every 12 hours.
Large dogs (>20kg): 20mg PO every 12 hours. If platelet count is normal
(>200,000/μul) after 3 to 4 weeks, taper dose by 25 to 50 percent. If count remains
stable, continue to taper by 25 to 50 percent every 3 to 4 weeks, to lowest effec-
tive dose.
 Prednisolone is likely preferable to prednisone in cats
■ Dexamethasone (0.2-0.25 mg/kg IV or SQ every 12 hours) is an acceptable alter-
native to prednisone if oral medication is not tolerated.
 Vincristine (0.02 mg/kg strictly IV once only) may effect a rapid increase in platelet
count.
■ Adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy should be considered in cases refractory to
decreases with attempts to wean glucocorticoids:
 Cyclosporine (5mg/kg PO every 12 hours) in dogs and cats
■ Azathioprine (2 mg/kg PO every 24 hours) in dogs. Decrease frequency to every
48 hours after glucocorticoid discontinuation, or if a decrease in white blood cell

■Mycophenolate mofetil (10-20 mg/kg PO every 12 hours) in dogs
 Intravenous human immunoglobulin (0.5-1.5 g/kg IV infusion over 6-12 hours) has
been suggested to be of benefit in initial therapy. Effect can be rapid, but sustained
immunosuppression is unlikely. Administer together with glucocorticoids with or
without adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy.
Gastroprotectants:
■ H receptor antagonists while on high-dose glucocorticoids
■ Sucralfate with or without proton pump inhibitor if suspected gastrointestinal
ulceration
■ Blood transfusion:

trate, platelet-rich plasma, or fresh whole blood (20 ml/kg).
■ Packed red blood cells (10ml/kg, over 4 hours) are indicated if severe anemia.
platelet count or hemostasis. Decision to transfuse should be based on patients
clinical signs, not only PCV.
Precautions/Interactions
■Avoid medications associated with secondary IMT or bone marrow suppression, as
well as therapies that cause immune stimulation (e.g., vaccines).
 Avoid drugs that inhibit platelet function (e.g., NSAIDs).
■ Do not use azathioprine in cats.
■ Vincristine should only be used if adequate bone marrow function is assured and
following diagnostic workup for underlying neoplasia.
■ Vincristine must be given strictly IV; extravasation is extremely caustic.
Activity
■ Enforce restricted activity until platelet count approaches normal range.
Surgical Considerations
 Splenectomy should be considered in cases refractory to medical management. This
is generally reserved for patients that fail to achieve remission following multiple
combination immunosuppressive regimens.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ IMT and associated complications can be fatal, particularly in the acute period until
partial remission is achieved. If the patient survives this period, prognosis is relatively
good.
■ The patient will need to be on medications for months. In some cases, lifelong treat-
ment is necessary.
■ Relapses and recurrences are possible.
■ Regular recheck visits will be necessary, adding to the financial and time
commitment.
■ There are likely to be clinically significant adverse effects of corticosteroids; these
will diminish as the dose is decreased, and will abate when drug is discontinued.
IMMUNE-MEDIATED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (IMT)
427
■ Use appropriate precautions for immunosuppressed patients.
■
 Monitor for signs of recurrent bleeding, or adverse drug reactions (e.g., inappetence,
lethargy, melena, pollakiuria).
■ Live virus vaccination and drugs associated with secondary IMT should be avoided
Patient Monitoring
Inpatient Monitoring
■ Signs of anemia—Tachycardia, bounding pulses, tachypnea, decreasing PCV
 Signs of bleeding—Respiratory rate and effort, mentation, stool, urine
■Adverse effects of therapy (e.g., volume overload, transfusion reaction)
■Platelet count every 48 hours until >50.000
 Outpatient Monitoring
 Platelet count—Weekly until normal, then every other week for 2 to 3 months, then
monthly until 3 months following discontinuation of drugs. If any evidence of
relapse, increase frequency of counts.
■ CBC—-Performed with platelet counts if other cell lines affected, and if the patient
is on azathioprine therapy.
 Azathioprine-CBCs as noted, chemistry profile (liver parameters) monthly or if
concerns.
 Cyclosporine— Trough drug concentration should be assessed if inadequate response,
or suspicion of toxicity.

Ivermectin Toxicity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Ivermectin and other macrolides, such as selamectin, dormectin, moxidectin, and
milbemycin, are antiparasitic drugs that are effective against both external and inter-
nal parasites.
In general, these drugs are commonly used, are very effective, and have wide margins
of safety.
Some collie-type breeds have a genetic mutation that causes them to develop neuro-
toxicity at low doses.
 In other breeds toxicity occurs only with severe overdose.
 This discussion refers to ivermectin but applies to other similarly acting
macrolides.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Ivermectin and other similarly acting drugs act as GABA agonists at the neuromus-
      d    
parasites.
GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
■In mammals, GABA-containing neurons are limited to the CNS where the
 sp  on nsxa   sid  o
ivermectin.
 The multiple drug resistance gene, MDRl, encodes for P-glycoprotein, a principal
component of the blood-brain barrier. The mutation, mmdrl-18, results in loss of
P-glycoprotein function, and thereby allows access to the brain by ivermectin and
some other drugs that are also substrates of P-glycoprotein. Dogs with this mutant
allele are susceptible to ivermectin toxicity at low doses.
Systems Affected
■ The toxic effect is on the neurologic system; other organ systems are affected
indirectly.
429
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Genetic Basis
■Analysis of the history of the canine mutation shows that dogs carrying the
mutant allele mmdrl-18 are descendants of a dog that lived in Great Britain before
1873 and was one of the foundation dogs for a branch of working sheepdogs selected
for show.
■ Seven collie-type breeds and two sighthound breeds were identified as carrying this
allele. These modern-day breeds are collie, Shetland sheepdog, old English sheepdog.
McNab cattledog, Australian shepherd, miniature Australian shepherd, and English
shepherd. Two other breeds of sighthound type but descended from the common
ancestor are silken windhound and longhaired whippet.
■ Within breeds, the frequency of the mutant allele varies from less than 4 percent in
old English sheepdogs to more than 50 percent in collies.
 Ivermectin sensitivity has been reported in border collie, bearded collie, and Australian
cattle dog. The mutant allele was not found in one study that included members of
these breeds, indicating a low frequency of the allele or that another mutation is
responsible.
Signs
Toxicity is to the CNS with other systems affected secondarily
■Ataxia
■
Tremors
■Seizures
■Coma
■Death
Historical Findings
■  Ivermectin toxicity should be considered in a dog belonging to a susceptible breed
with a history of acute onset of neurologic signs combined with recent exposure to
drugs in this group.
■ In dogs with the mutant allele, doses of ivermectin of 100 to 500 μg/kg have caused
toxicity.
■ In other breeds, toxicity occurs only with severe overdoses (>2000μg/kg) usually
 caused by miscalculation using equine or bovine preparations. The median lethal
 dose for experimental beagle dogs was 80,000 μg/kg.
■  Exposure can also occur from dogs eating feces of treated large animals because the
drug is eliminated in the feces.
■ Young animals are more susceptible to toxicity because their blood-brain barrier is
not fully developed.
■ Toxicity has been reported in kittens at doses of 300 to 400μg/kg.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Physical Examination
■ Ataxia or recumbency and altered mental state (e.g., depression, obtundation) are
the primary neurologic signs with stupor, coma, and even death occurring in severely
affected dogs.
 Those with depressed mentation may also have decreased gag reflex.
■ Muscle tremors, seizures, and loss of menace and pupillary light response may
occur.
■
Spinal cord reflexes may be normal or increased.
Other signs include bradycardia, mydriasis, miosis, hypersalivation and vomiting.

doses.
Onset of signs can be within a few hours after administration of a single dose
■ Animals being treated daily may develop signs of toxicity only after several days.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
1Differentiation from other causes of acute onset neurologic signs is based on a history
of exposure to the drug in a susceptible canine breed or severe overdose in other
animals.
DIAGNOSTICS
Laboratory
  Ivermectin and other macrolides can be detected in serum, gastrointestinal contents.
liver, and fat but levels in tissues do not correlate with toxicity because it is the
concentration of the drug in the brain that determines toxicity.
Other
■ Reversal of neurologic signs in response to the anticholinesterase physostigmine
supports but does not confirm a diagnosis. Its use for this purpose is not recom-
mended because of adverse side effects (see Therapeutics).
■ A DNA-based test for the mutant genotype is available and could be used to confirm
that a dog is at increased risk of toxicity.
Pathological Findings
■ No specific lesions are directly caused by these drugs.
THERAPEUTICS
■ The goals of therapy are decontamination and support.
Drug(s) of choice
■ There is no specific antidote.
 If the drug has been ingested in the past 2 hours emesis should be induced, provided
that the patient is alert enough to protect its airway. If the patient is not able to
protect its airway, orogastric lavage under general anesthesia with intubation should
be performed.
■ Orogastric lavage should be followed by activated charcoal and a sorbital cathartic.
Repeat doses of activated charcoal are indicated because of the potential for entero-
hepatic recirculation
term improvement of clinical signs. Physostigmine may result in partial improvement
of signs but the effect lasts less than 1 hour. The potential toxicities of physostigmine
are tremors, seizures, ptyalism, lacrimation, urination, and defecation. It does not
target ivermectin toxicity directly and is not recommended.
■ Picrotoxin, a GABA antagonist, has also been used to treat ivermectin toxicity
Picrotoxin resulted in a rapid improvement in mental state followed by a seizure.
risk of adverse effects.
■ If treatment for seizures or tremors is required it may be advisable to avoid the use
of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, because the binding sites for benzodiazepine.
GABA, and ivermectin are closely associated. It has been proposed, but not proven
that enhancement of the toxic effects might occur. Barbiturates may be preferable
because their binding site in the brain is not as closely associated with the ivermectin
binding site.
Supportive Care
■ Patients should receive supportive care as appropriate for their clinical signs and
must be closely monitored. Long-term intensive care nursing may be needed.
■  Deterioration from the initial presenting signs for approximately the next 6 days
followed by gradual improvement over the next 6 to 18 days is expected. Longer
courses have been reported.
 Special attention should be paid to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems because
hypoventilation that requires mechanical ventilation and bradycardia that requires
treatment with an anticholinergic agent such as glycopyrrolate have been reported.
■ Aspiration pneumonia due to a combination of recumbency and a decreased gag
reflex can occur.
 Patients who are unable to eat and drink normally must receive fluid and electrolyte
therapy and nutritional support. Oral intake of food or water should not be attempted

in patients with altered mental states because they may have decreased gag reflexes
and be unable to properly protect their airway. In these patients, nasogastric or
gastric tube feeding is preferred but intravenous nutrition may be preferred.
■ Severely affected patients are recumbent and meticulous care for the recumbent
 patient is needed.
COMMENTS
Prognosis
 The prognosis for recovery without long-term sequelae is good even in severely
affected patients provided that aggressive intensive care support is administered.

Lily Toxicity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Lily toxicity causes acute nephrotoxicity in cats.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ A variety of Lilium and Hemerocallis lily species (Figures 57.1 and 57.2) have been
associated with nephrotoxicity, including Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), tiger lily
(L. tigrinum), asiatic hybrid lily (Lilium sp.). day lily (Hemorocallis dumortirei,
H. fulva), early day lily (H. sieboldii), orange day lily (H. graminea), red lily (L.
umbellatum), rubrum lily (L. speciosum ruburm), stargazer lily (L. orientalis), western
lily (L. umbellatum), and wood lily (L. umbellatum). Both the leaves and flowers
are toxic, although the flowers seem more toxic. The toxic principle is water
soluble.
Systems Affected
  Renal/Urologic— The predominant component of lily toxicity is acute tubular nephro-
sis that causes acute renal failure. Azotemia is apparent within 24 hours of
ingestion.
1 Gastrointestinal—Vomiting is a common occurrence within hours of ingestion.
Pancreatitis and pancreatic lesions can occur within 8 hours of ingestion.
Nervous-Seizures may occur as early as 8 hours after ingestion.
■
Hepatobiliary—Liver enzyme elevations have been reported in later stages of
disease.
■ Musculoskeletal—Increased creatine kinase was noted in experimental cases, but no
histologic lesions were seen in muscle tissue.

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 teritis without renal failure.
Historical Findings
1Vomiting, anorexia, and lethargy are usually the initial signs, and appear within l
 to 5 days after ingestion. The initial gastrointestinal signs may resolve, followed by
signs of uremia. Polyuria may occur as early as l2 hours after ingestion. Neurologic
signs of ataxia, depression, tremors, and seizures have been reported.
 Owners may find parts of the plant in vomitus, or evidence that the plant has been
chewed (Figure 57.3).
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Dehydration, renal pain, and renomegaly are common findings on initial examina-
tion. Mentation may vary from bright and alert to comatose. Urine output varies
from anuric to polyuric; overhydration is common in anuric cats shortly after starting
fluid therapy. Fever has been reported in some cases.
438
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■  Initial gastrointestinal signs (vomiting, anorexia)
■ Nonspecific gastroenteritis
■Dietary indiscretion
■ Pancreatitis
■ Acute uremia in cats
■ Nephrotoxins (e.g., ethylene glycol, NSAIDs, aminoglycosides)
■
 Ureteral obstruction
 Pyelonephritis
■ Lymphosarcoma
 Recent ischemic events (i.e., anesthesia, hypovolemia, hypotension)
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry
■ Azotemia: elevated BUN and creatinine with elevated phosphorus
Hyperkalemia (common) or hypokalemia
 Metabolic acidosis, elevated anion gap
Variable increased creatine kinase: decreases within a few days
Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase: increased
in later stages
■ Occasionally hypocalcemia
Urinalysis
Consistent with acute tubular nephrosis
■Isothenuria
■
Glucosuria
■Proteinuria
■ Granular casts
Pathological Findings
■ The kidneys are usually swollen and may have perirenal edema. Histologically
acute tubular nephrosis that affects predominantly the proximal tubule is character-
istic, frequently with evidence of epithelial regeneration. Small numbers of birefrin-
gent crystals are occasionally seen, but lily toxicity is not caused by oxalate
nephrosis
■ Pancreatic degeneration in early stages and fibrosing pancreatitis in late stages have
been reported. Hepatic and lung congestion may occur.
ULY TOXICITY
439
THERAPEUTICS
Therapeutic objectives
 Gastric decontamination to limit absorption of toxic components.
■ Early aggressive fluid treatment to counteract dehydration from polyuria and pos-
sibly to increase elimination of toxic component prior to onset of renal failure.
 Standard therapy to manage acute renal failure.
lily (Sathiphyllum spp.) and lily-of-the-valley (Convallaria majalis) are not true lilies
and do not cause nephrotoxicity.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Induce vomiting: apomorphine (administered via conjunctival sac or 0.03-0.04 mg/
kg IV), 3% hydrogen peroxide (0.25-0.5 ml/kg PO), or xylazine (0.44 mg/kg IV, IM,
or SQ)
■ Activated charcoal: 1 to 4 g/kg PO (protect airway with cuffed endotracheal tube if
patient is unconscious)
 Fluid therapy: balanced polyionic crystalloid (i.e., lactated Ringer's solution or plas-
malyte-147) or saline IV at twice the maintenance rate for 48 hours prior to onset
of renal failure
Precautions/Interactions
 If urine production is decreased, aggressive diuresis will result in volume overload.
Alternative Drugs
■If medical management does not control uremia, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis
has been used with favorable outcomes.
Diet
■  Anorexia is common and may require placement of a feeding tube for management.
COMMENTS
Client Education
  If renal failure resolves completely (or does not develop), no special care is needed
after discharge. If residual renal damage persists, standard care for chronic kidney
disease will be required.
Patient Monitoring
■ Early treatment: Assessment of BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, and phosphorus at
 admission and after 48 hours of fluid therapy is recommended.
■ After onset of renal failure: Monitoring as for any cause of acute renal failure.
Particular attention to volume status because many cats develop oliguria or anuria.
Prevention/Avoidance
■  Lily plants should not be available in the cat's environment. Lilies are common in
floral arrangements, and day lilies are common in gardens.
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Early treatment (within 18 hours of ingestion): Prompt decontamination and fluid
therapy may prevent renal failure and has a good prognosis
After development of renal failure: Overall mortality rates for cats with acute renal
failure from nephrotoxic causes are about 50 to 60 percent. Cats that survive the
acute phase may recover completely or have residual chronic kidney disease.

Lower Urinary Tract Infection (UTl)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Lower UTI encompasses a wide variety of clinical entities whose common denomina-
tor is microbial invasion of the bladder (cystitis), urethra (urethritis), prostate gland
(prostatitis), or two or more of these sites.
1 Bacteriuria—refers to the presence of bacteria in urine. Identification of bacteria in
urine is not synonymous with UTl because they may represent contaminants.
Signijficant bacteriuria is a term used to denote bacteriuria that represents UT1. A large
 number of bacteria in a properly collected and cultured urine specimen is indicative
of UT1. Small numbers of bacteria in urine obtained from untreated patients usually
 indicate contamination. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as significant bacteriuria
that is unaccompanied by clinical signs.
 Uncomplicated UTl—defined as an infection in which no underlying structural or
functional abnormality of the urinary system can be identified. Most uncomplicated
UTIs are likely to be caused by transient, self-liming. and potentially reversible
abnormalities of host defenses.
 Complicated UTl—occur secondary to identifiable diseases that interfere with normal
host defenses.
    r    i  
species and strain of microorganism within several weeks of the date of cessation of
antimicrobic therapy  Reinfections are recurrent UTls caused by a different
organism.
Superinfections—Superinfection is defined as infection with an additional organism
during the course of antimicrobic therapy.

Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Corynebacterium spp. also common
  s s e  o   i  eo sd t  
20 percent are caused by two species, and 8 percent are caused by three or more
species.
 Anaerobic bacteria, fungal agents, parasites, viruses, mycoplasmas, and ureaplasmas
 are uncommon causes in dogs and cats.
Systems Affected
■  Renal/Urologic—lower urinary tract
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Common in female dogs; less common in male dogs, uncommon in cats.
■Risk of UTI in cats increases with increasing age.
■ Increased risk associated with prolonged urinary catheterization, perineal urethros-
tomies, long-term corticosteroid administration, hyperadrenocorticism, and diabetes
mellitus.
Historical Findings

■ Urge incontinence—apparent loss of ability to voluntarily control urination
CLINICAL FEATURES
May be clinically normal.

■ Chronic infection—bladder or urethral wall may be thickened; masses may be
palpable.
■ Other predisposing anatomic or functional abnormalities associated with compli-
cated UTls may be identified.

DIAGNOSTICS
Results of CBC and serum biochemistries are usually normal.
and bacteria test pads are unsatisfactory for canine and feline urine specimens; stain-
ing of urine sediment with Wright's, Gram's, or new methylene blue stain may sig-
nificantly improve detection of bacteriuria.
Pyuria—Commonly associated with UT1 but may occur with inflammation that is
due to other noninfectious causes (e.g., uroliths); absence does not rule out UTI
because it may occur without an inflammatory response.
 Hematuria and proteinuria—Commonly associated with UTl but may be associated
with other inflammatory and noninflammatory disease processes; absence does not
rule out UTI because it may occur without an inflammatory response.
■ Bacteriuria—presence of bacteria in urine; commonly associated with UTl but may
represent specimen contamination during collection or storage or misinterpretation
of nonbacterial look-alikes in urine sediment; absence does not rule out UTl because
large numbers of bacteria are required for visualization by light microscopy.
 Diagnostic quantitative urine culture and sensitivity testing
■ Necessary for definitive diagnosis are isolation and identification of bacteria.
quantification of the number of bacteria (cfu) per mL of urine, and determination
of the organism's susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.

interpretation of culture results; cystocentesis is generally the preferred method
of collection; antimicrobics should be discontinued for 3 to 5 days before diag-
nostic urine culture; urine may be refrigerated in sterile closed container for up
to 8 hours without substantial changes in results; commercially manufactured
collection tubes containing preservatives combined with refrigeration may be used
to preserve specimens for up to 72 hours.
 Quantification of bacteria in a urine sample allows differentiation between harm-
less bacterial contaminants of urine and pathogenic organisms causing UTI.
Detection of greater than 1,000 cfu/mL of urine collected by cystocentesis is con-
sidered significant bacteriuria in dogs and cats and indicates the probability of
UT1. In urine samples collected by voluntary micturition or manual compression
of the urinary bladder, detection of greater than 100,000 cfu/mL of urine in dogs
and 10,000 cfu/mL of urine in cats is consistent with UT1. However, studies in
normal dogs and cats have shown that contamination of voided urine samples
may result in colony counts of greater than lo0,0o0/mL. Consequently, voided
urine samples are generally unsatisfactory for routine diagnostic bacterial culture
In addition, other factors may influence the results of quantitative cultures of urine
including, species, collection method, time elapsed between collection and culture.
method of preservation, in vivo growth characteristics of the bacteria, frequency
or micturition, magnitude of diuresis, site(s) of infection, and administration of
antimicrobics prior to bacterial culture.
■  In vitro susceptibility testing that determines the MlC of each drug against the
bacterial isolate is the preferred method of identifying appropriate antimicrobics.
Any antimicrobic whose urine concentration is at least four times the MlC of the
bacterial isolate is likely to be effective.
■ Aerobic culture of bladder wall biopsy specimens may detect UTI in patients with
negative urine cultures.
 Survey and contrast radiographic and ultrasonic evaluations of the lower urinary
 tract may exclude other causes of lower urinary tract signs and identify predisposing
factors (e.g., neoplasia) or sequelae (e.g., infection-induced struvite uroliths). Rarely
intramural gas formation may be observed (emphysematous cystitis).
  Urethrocystoscopy may exclude other causes of lower urinary tract signs and identify
predisposing factors or sequelae.
■ Biopsies obtained with urinary catheters, cystoscopes, or via surgery may permit
morphologic characterization of the inflammatory or neoplastic lesions; not routinely
needed.
Pathologic Findings
■ Varying degrees of mucosal ulceration and submucosal edema, vasodilation,
hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltration are common light microscopic
lesions observed in urinary bladders of patients with acute and chronic bacterial
Cystitis.

nuclear cell infiltration, epithelial proliferation, and development of villus-like sessile
polyps.
Granulomatous (proliferative cystitis)—an uncommon form of chronic urethritis
resulting in partial or complete urethral obstruction; lesions are generally character-
ized by severe, extensive, lymphocytic or chronic suppurative inflammation with
granulation tissue and edema.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Therapeutic goals are to eliminate bacteria from urine and tissues and allow the
urinary tract and its defense mechanisms time to recover sufficient function to
prevent recurrence.
  s       e s 
nostic evaluation may require brief hospitalization.
■ Predisposing abnormalities in host defenses should be eliminated or controlled.
■Antimicrobial should be selected on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
their ability to achieve high concentrations in urine, ease of administration, relative
cost, and safety.
■ Antimicrobial are most effective when administered every 8 hour; however, fluoro-
quinolones and trimethoprim-sulfa products are effective when administered every
12 hour.
 Acute uncomplicated bacterial UTl may be treated empirically without results of
susceptibility testing provided that patients have not had frequent or recurrent signs
and have not been given antimicrobial drugs in the past 4 to 6 weeks; a 10- to 14-
day course is usually effective.
 Results of susceptibility testing are essential for patients with a complicated UT1, a
history of recurrent or persistent signs, prior antimicrobial therapy, or recent cath-
eterization, or who are at high risk for morbidity (e.g., uremia, urinary ouflow
obstruction)
 Chronic or complicated UTl resulting from an identifiable disease that impairs host
defenses (e.g., diabetes mellitus) should be treated for 4 to 6 weeks; however, some
patients may require longer treatment to eradicate infection.
 Long-term low-dose antimicrobial therapy can be used to prevent UTls in patients
with frequent reinfections. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is started immediately
after eradication of the most recent episode of UTI using conventional therapy.
Generally, the same antimicrobial that successfully eradicated the latest episode of
UTI is used for long-term prophylactic therapy. The antimicrobial dose is reduced
to one half to one-third the normal total daily dose given every 24 hours at bedtime
after the animal has urinated; continue therapy for 6 months.
Drug(s) of choice
■ Ampicillin 25mg/kg PO every 8 hours
■
Amoxicillin 1l mg/kg PO every 8 hours
■
 Amoxicillin/clavulanate 10 to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours
■
Tetracycline 20 mg/kg PO every 8 hours
■ Trimethoprim-sulfadiazine 15 mg/kg combined PO every 12 hours
Cephalexin 30 mg/kg PO every 8 hours
■上
Enrofloxacin 2.5 mg/kg PO every 12 hours
Precautions/Interactions
■ Specific antimicrobial drugs are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensi-
tivity to them.
■ Trimethoprim-sulfa products have been associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca,
hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, anemia, granulocytopenia, and polyarthritis in dogs; use
with caution in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease.
■ Enrofloxacin has been associated with retinal degeneration in cats treated with high
doses.
 Tetracyclines may cause discoloration of teeth in young animals; avoid coadministra-
tion with food especially daily products; use with caution in patients with pre-
existing renal or hepatic disease.
■ Because of potential nephrotoxicity associated with long-term administration of
 aminoglycosides, alternative safer antimicrobics should be selected whenever pos-
sible; use with extreme caution in patients with pre-existing renal disease.
Alternative Drugs
■ Chloramphenicol 33 mg/kg PO every 8 hours
■ Nitrofurantoin 4 mg/kg PO every 6 to 8 hours
■ Amikacin 15 to 20 mg/kg SQ, IM, or IV every 24 hours
■ Imipenem/Cilastatin 5 to 10 mg/kg SQ or IV every 8 hours
Diet
■ Dietary modification may be indicated for management of other concurrent urinary
tract disorders (e.g., urolithiasis).
Surgical Considerations
■ Only indicated for detection or correction of abnormalities predisposing to UTI
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Clinical improvement can be expected in 24 to 48 hours after initiating appropriate
therapy; however, compliance with treatment recommendations is essential to allow
adequate time for host urinary tract defenses to heal and regain sufficient function
to prevent recurrence.
  Prognosis for simple uncomplicated UTl is generally good to excellent.
■ Prognosis for complicated UT1 depends on the nature of the infecting organism
(virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility) and the ability to identify and correct or
control predisposing abnormalities of host defenses.
Compliance with recommendations for treatment and follow-up is crucial for optimal
results.
Patient Monitoring
■ Therapeutic urine culture—Culture of urine at strategic times during antimicrobial
therapy (so-called therapeutic cultures) is an effective method of assessing therapy.
especially in patients with a high risk of morbidity or mortality associated with their
UTI or in patients receiving potentially toxic antimicrobics. Therapeutic cultures
allow timely testing of antimicrobial efficacy verification of proper antimicrobial
drug administration, early detection of emerging bacterial resistance, timely detec-
tion of persistent infections, and provision of justification for early discontinuation
of potentially toxic antimicrobial. Initial response to therapy is considered effective
only if culture of a properly collected urine sample does not result in growth of
bacteria. Therapeutic urine cultures are typically performed 3 to 5 days after initia-
tion of antimicrobial therapy, 3 to 5 days before scheduled discontinuation of therapy.
or anytime clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities recur during therapy.
 Surveillance urine culture—After antimicrobial therapy, timely follow-up evalua-
tions (so-called surveillance cultures) are indicated to confirm eradication of the UTl
and to detect recurrent infections at a subclinical state. Surveillance cultures are
essential to differentiate relapses from reinfections. Urine collected by cystocentesis
should be cultured 7 to 10 days after completing antimicrobic therapy to confirm
successful eradication and identify relapses. Urine culture may be performed at l to
2 months and 3 to 6 months after completion of therapy to detect reinfections
Patients receiving long-term low-dose prophylactic antimicrobial therapy should
S            s
  Urine culture and urinalysis should be performed anytime clinical signs recur.
Prevention/Avoidance
 Identify and eliminate or control predisposing abnormalities of host defenses
 Avoid indiscriminate use of urinary catheters.
■ Avoid surgical procedures that permanently alter host defenses (e.g., perineal
urethrostomies).
■ Consider long-term low-dose prophylactic antimicrobial therapy in patients with
frequent reinfections.
Possible Complications
Struvite urolithiasis—UTI with urease-producing microbes (Staphylococcus, Proteus,
Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, and Ureaplasma spp.)
 Polypoid cystitis—uncommon; may be associated with chronic bacterial UTI
 Emphysematous cystitis—uncommon; associated with infection with gas-producing
microbes
 Granulomatous (proliferative) urethritis—uncommon; may be associated with
chronic bacterial UTI
■ Pyelonephritis, prostatitis, diskospondylitis, endocarditis, or sepsis
Expected Course and Prognosis
■Untreated UTls persist indefinitely and may be associated with an increased risk for

■ Clinical signs typically improve within 24 to 48 hours after initiation of appropriate
therapy: persistent signs may be due to treatment failure or the presence of other
concurrent lower urinary tract disorders that cause similar signs (e.g., uroliths).
■ Prognosis for simple uncomplicated UTI is generally good to excellent.
■ Prognosis for complicated UTI depends on the nature of the infecting organism
(virulence and antimicrobic susceptibility) and the ability to identify and correct or

Magnesium Disorders
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■Hypomagnesemia
■ Dogs—serum magnesium <1.89 mg/dL and ionized magnesium <0.43 mmol/L.
■ Cats-serum magnesium <l.9 mg/dL and ionized magnesium <0.43 mmol/L.
Hypermagnesemia
Dogs-
serum magnesium >2.51 mg/dL and ionized magnesium >0.60 mmol/L.
■ Cats—serum magnesium >2.6 mg/dL and ionized magnesium >0.70 mmol/L.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation. The vast majority of
magnesium is found in bone (60 percent) and muscle (20 percent). Less than 1
percent of total body magnesium is present in the serum.
 Because greater than 99 percent of total body magnesium is located in the intracel-
lular compartment, serum magnesium concentrations do not always reflect total
body magnesium status. Therefore, a normal serum magnesium concentration can
 occur in the presence of a total body magnesium deficiency.
  In the serum, magnesium exists in three distinct fractions: a protein-bound fraction
(30 percent), an anion-complexed fraction (5 percent), and an ionized fraction (65
percent). The ionized fraction is thought to be the physiologically active
component.
■ Ilonized magnesium appears to equilibrate rapidly across the cell membrane; thus
extracellular ionized magnesium concentrations may be a more accurate indicator of
intracellular stores.
 Magnesium is a coenzyme for the membrane-bound sodium-potassium ATPase
pump and functions to maintain the sodium-potassium gradient across all mem-
branes; as a result, it plays an important role in the activity of electrically excitable
tissues.
 Interference with the electrical gradient can alter resting membrane potential, signal
transduction, and smooth muscle tone, resulting in cardiovascular abnormalities
such as arrhythmias and inappropriate vascular tone.
 Magnesium decreases acetylcholine release from nerve terminals and depresses the
excitability of nerve and muscle membranes. Therefore, hypermagnesemia results in
453
454  BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
hyporeflexia and flaccid paralysis and hypomagnesemia can result in muscle fascicu-
lations and seizures
■  Magnesium regulates calcium movement into smooth muscle cells and can affect
peripheral vascular tone and contractile strength.
■ Because magnesium is necessary for the movement of sodium, potassium, and
calcium into and out of cells, other manifestations of hypomagnesemia include meta-
bolic abnormalities such as concurrent hypokalemia (often refractory to potassium
supplementation), hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia.
 The renal system is the main regulator of serum magnesium concentration and total
body magnesium content; any condition or disease that lowers glomerular filtration
rate can cause hypermagnesemia.
■ Hypomagnesemia causes resistance to the effects of PTH and increases the uptake of
calcium into bone.
■ The incidence of hypomagnesemia in dogs ranges from 6 to 54 percent, with the
higher incidence rates occurring in critically ill dogs.
■ The incidence of hypomagnesemia in cats has been reported to be 28 percent in a
population of cats admitted to an intensive care unit.
■ The incidence of hypermagnesemia in dogs has been reported to be 13 percent in a
population of dogs admitted to a critical care unit. These dogs were 2.6 times more
likely to not survive their illness when compared to dogs with normal serum mag-
nesium concentrations.
■The incidence of hypermagnesemia in cats has been reported to be 17.5 percent in
a population of cats admitted to an intensive care unit.
Systems Affected

cardiac disease, intoxications, and other electrolyte  disorders such as
hyperkalemia.
DIAGNOSTICS
■  Indications for determining magnesium status are the presence of clinical signs asso-
ciated with hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia, and the presence of disease
processes, which may lead to alterations in total body magnesium concentrations.
Determination of serum and/or ionized magnesium concentrations are most com-
monly done to determine magnesium status. lonized magnesium concentrations are
preferred over serum concentrations because ionized magnesium is thought to be
the physiologically active component of the electrolyte and a more accurate indicator
of intracellular magnesium stores
■If serum or ionized magnesium concentrations are not routinely measured, the pres-
supplementation.
■Alternate methods of evaluating magnesium status may include mononuclear blood
cell magnesium concentrations or quantifying retention of a loading dose of magne-
sium. Human studies suggest that retention of greater than 40 to 50 percent of an
administered magnesium load indicates total body magnesium depletion, whereas
retention of less than 20 percent indicates adequate magnesium stores. (These tests
are rarely done in veterinary medicine.)
■ Urinary magnesium determination may help differentiate abnormalities associated
with urinary magnesium loss from diseases of decreased intake, gastrointestinal loss.
or alterations in magnesium distribution within the body.
  Electrodiagnostics (e.g., electrocardiography and electromyelography) may reveal
 the effects of hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia but will not help differentiate
the cause.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Hypomagnesemia—correct underlying problem, supplement magnesium, and dis-
continue drugs that cause renal magnesium loss
 Hypermagnesemia—correct underlying problem, discontinue magnesium containing
magnesium.
MAGNESIUM DISORDERS
457
Drug(s) of Choice
■Hypomagnesemia
■ For rapid repletion of serum magnesium concentrations, magnesium chloride or
magnesium sulfate can be administered IV in normal saline or 5% dextrose in
water by continuous rate infusion at 0.75 to 1.0 mEq/kg per day for the first 24
to 48 hours.
■A lower dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day can then be used for an additional 3
to 5 days, if needed.
■ For the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, a dose of 0.15 to
0.3 mEq/kg of magnesium diluted in normal saline or 5% dextrose in water can
be slowly administered IV over 5 to 15 minutes.
■ In stable patients with mild hypomagnesemia, magnesium chloride, magnesium
gluconate, magnesium oxide, or magnesium hydroxide can be administered orally
at a dose of 1 to 2 mEg/kg every 24 hours
Hypermagnesemia
■Diurese with 0.9% NaCl at 2 to 4 ml/kg per hour IV.
■ Furosemide at 1 to 4mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours PO, SQ, IM, or IV to increase
renal magnesium excretion.
■ Calcium gluconate at 50 mg/kg IV over 15 to 30 minutes to antagonize the effects
of magnesium at the neuromuscular junction and to reverse the cardiotoxic effects
of hypermagnesemia.
■ Physostigmine at 0.02mg/kg every 12 hours IV to antagonize the neurotoxic
effects of hypermagnesemia.
Precautions/Interactions
Hypomagnesemia
 Parenteral administration of magnesium sulfate may result in hypocalcemia due
to chelation of calcium with the sulfate. Therefore, magnesium chloride should
be administered when hypocalcemia is already present.
■ Side effects of supplemental magnesium therapy include hypotension, atrioven-
tricular and bundle-branch blocks. Adverse effects are usually associated with
intravenous boluses rather than continuous rate infusions.
■ Monitor ECG and blood pressure closely if administering magnesium rapidly IV.
■ Decrease supplemental magnesium dose by 50 percent if renal disease or atrio-
ventricular block is present and monitor ECG.
■ Avoid drugs such as aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and cyclosporine because they
can cause renal tubular injury and lead to increased renal loss of magnesium.
■Avoid drugs such as furosemide, thiazides, and mannitol because they can increase
renal loss of magnesium.
■Hypermagnesemia
■Avoid magnesium containing drugs such as cathartics, laxatives, and antacids.
■ Monitor ECG while administering calcium gluconate.
■ Do not administer furosemide to dehydrated, hypotensive, or shocky patients.
Diet
■Many veterinary critical care diets contain low concentrations of magnesium (range
0.1-0.22 mg/kcal). Given that many critically ill patients are fed at or below their
resting energy requirement, the actual intake of magnesium may be well below the
concentration needed to replete a magnesium deficient animal.
■ Magnesium supplementation in standard total parenteral nutrition formulations
(0.13-0.22 mEq/kg per day) is also below the concentration recommended to treat
hypomagnesemia (0.3-1.0 mEq/kg per day).
■ Based on low concentrations of magnesium in critical care diets and total parenteral
nutrition formulations, animals with moderate to marked hypomagnesemia will
 likely require intravenous or oral magnesium supplementation to normalize serum
magnesium concentrations, especially if they have disease processes resulting in
continued loss of magnesium from the gastrointestinal tract and/or kidneys.
Activity
■ Both moderate to marked hypo- and hypermagnesemia can cause weakness, and the
 patient may require assistance when standing or walking.
Surgical Considerations
■ Due to magnesium's effect on the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems, moder-
ate to marked hypo- or hypermagnesemia should be corrected prior to anesthesia
and surgery.
COMMENTS
 1 mEq of magnesium is equal to 12 mg of magnesium which is equal to 0.5 mmol of
magnesium. To convert from mg/dL to mEq/L, divide by 1.2.
Client Education
■Monitor for signs of hypo- or hypermagnesemia. Unfortunately, many of the clinical
signs for these electrolyte disorders are nonspecific (e.g., weakness, lethargy and
depression).
Patient Monitoring
■ Recheck total serum or ionized magnesium concentrations until normalized. The
recheck interval will depend on the severity of the electrolyte disorder, clinical stabil-
ity of the patient, and the underlying disease process.
Prevention/Avoidance
■Work with veterinarian to resolve or control the underlying disease process that leads
to the animals hypo- or hypermagnesemia.
MAGNESIUM DISORDERS
459
Possible Complications
■ Severe, untreated hypo- and hypermagnesemia can be fatal.
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Depending on the underlying disease process, prognosis can range from guarded to
good. The prognosis for correcting and resolving hypermagnesemia secondary to
acute anuric renal failure is likely guarded, while the prognosis for correcting and
resolving hypomagnesemia secondary to lactation is good.

Marjuana Intoxication
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Toxicity from the oral or inhaled exposure to 9-THC, the primary component of
marijuana (Cannabis sativa) that causes its clinical effects
 Causes primarily neurological depression, ataxia, and urinary incontinence but can
also cause gastrointestinal signs (most commonly vomiting)
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Oral exposure is the most commonly reported route, although there are reports of
teenagers exposing their pets to marijuana smoke.
1 THC acts on a unique cannabinoid receptor in the brain that causes CNS
signs.
The onset of effects occurs within 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion or exposure; signs
may last up to 72 hours.
 THC undergoes enterohepatic recirculation and has a long half-life due to lipid
solubility.
 THC is excreted in the urine, feces, and bile.
■ Oral LD50
■ Dogs 3g/kg
■Cats 200mg/kg
■Fatalities are rare.
■ Clinical signs occur at much lower doses.
Systems Affected
1 Nervous: THC affects a variety of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin
and GABA, and results in CNS depression.
Gastrointestinal: Although THC has antiemetic properties, it can cause vomiting in
dogs and cats.
■ Cardiac: Bradycardia and hypotension may occur secondary to CNS depression, and
tachycardia may also occur.
461
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Dogs account for 96 percent of the exposures; cats account for 3 percent.
■  Due to the inquisitive nature of puppies, younger dogs (<l year) were the predomi-
nant patients in one study
Risk Factors/Causes
■Client households with teenage children may have a higher incident but can occur
in all households or with environmental exposure
Historical Findings
■ Tactful questioning must be employed when marijuana exposure is suspected.
■ Owners may report ataxia, depression, and urinary incontinence.
CLINICAL FEATURES
 Neurologic signs included: depression, ataxia, tremors, seizures, mydriasis, disorien-
 tation, behavioral disorders, hyperesthesia, hyperactivity, head bobbing, recumbency.
and stupor.
■ Other signs reported: hypothermia, bradycardia, vocalization, anorexia, urinary
incontinence, and tachycardia
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Other potential toxins causing CNS depression must be considered as differential
diagnosis including: ethanol, ethylene glycol, ivermectin, opioids, barbiturates, ben-
zodiazepines, phenothiazines, amphetamines, antihistamines, cocaine, methylxan-
thines, and tricyclic antidepressants.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ No specific serum chemistry profile abnormalities
■ THC is detectable in urine and plasma, and urine drug screening tests are commer-
cially available. The sensitivity of a urine drug screening test may be affected by
amount of THC ingested, time elapsed since ingestion, and water consumption after
ingestion.
MARIJUANA INTOXICATION
463
THERAPEUTICS
 Because there is no specific antidote for marijuana toxicity, therapy is targeted at
minimizing absorption and supportive care.
Decontamination:
■ Induce emesis within 30 minutes of ingestion and if patient is asymptomatic.
■  Induction of emesis may be difficult due to the potent antiemetic properties of
THC.
 Orogastric lavage under general anesthesia with cuffed endotracheal tube in place
■ Administer activated charcoal every 8 hours for the first 24 hours due to entero-
hepatic recirculation; use cautiously or not at all in recumbent animals because
of risk of aspiration.
 For symptomatic animals: intravenous fluids (balanced electrolyte solution), ther-
moregulation, alternating body position every 4 hours
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Diazepam (0.25-0.5mg/kg IV) for agitation or seizures; start with lower dose to
prevent excessive sedation
■Atropine sulfate (0.02-0.04mg/kg IV, IM, or SQ) for severe bradycardia
Precautions/Interactions
■ Other CNS depressing drugs should be minimized due to the cumulative effect.
Activity
 Provide a quiet, darkened environment with minimal stimulation.
COMMENTS
Patient Monitoring

prolonged recumbency), cardiac function (heart rate, blood pressure), and body
temperature every 2 to 4 hours.
Possible Complications
■ THC can lower the seizure threshold in humans, it is unclear if this occurs in dogs
and cats.
Expected Course and Prognosis
1 The prognosis is favorable for symptomatic animals with no secondary complications
such as aspiration pneumonia. With supportive care, affected animals usually recover
within 72 hours.

Metabolic Acidosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Decrease in plasma pH associated with a decrease in HCO concentration (dogs
<18mEq/L; cats, <l6 mEq/L) and a compensatory decrease in PCO2
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Metabolic acidosis may develop secondary to hyperphosphatemia (hyperphospha.
temic acidosis), corrected hyperchloremia (hyperchloremic acidosis), and accumula-
tion of metabolically produced strong anions (strong ion gap or high-AG acidosis).
The most common causes of metabolic acidosis in critical care patients are presented
in Table 62.1.
 Metabolic acidoses, especially lactic acidosis, uremic acidosis, and diabetic ketoaci-
dosis, occur commonly in critically ill patients.
1Hyperphosphatemic acidosis
■ Increase in plasma weak acids (e.g., inorganic phosphate) is associated with meta-
bolic acidosis and increased AG. At pH of 7.4, a l mg/dL increase in phosphate
concentration is associated with a 0.58 mEq/L decrease in HCO and a 0.58 mEq/L
increase in AG.
 Hyperchloremic acidosis
rhea), or by administration of substances containing more chloride than sodium
as compared with normal extracellular fluid composition (e.g., administration of
KCl, 0.9% NaCl).
■  In critically ill patients the source of hyperchloremic acidosis is often iatrogenic
A common cause is related to the volume of saline infused during resuscitation
from shock.
■Acidemia is usually not severe in patients with hyperchloremic acidosis.
1High-AG acidosis
■  Increase in the concentration of other strong anions: addition (e.g., ethylene glycol
metabolism), or renal retention (e.g., renal failure) of strong anions other than

Systems Affected
■ Respiratory—Increased H+ stimulates peripheral and central chemoreceptors to
increase alveolar ventilation; hyperventilation decreases PCO, which counters the
effects of low plasma HCO3 on pH. In dogs, a decrease of approximately 0.7 mm Hg
in PCO, is expected for each l mEq/L decrease in plasma HCO. Little is known
about compensation in cats, but it appears to be almost non-existent.
Renal/Urologicthe kidneys increase net acid excretion, primarily by increasing
excretion of NH and chloride. This compensatory mechanism is not very effective
in cats.
■ Cardiovascular—A fall in pH results in an increase in sympathetic discharge but
simultaneously causes a decrease in the responsiveness of the cardiac myocytes and
vascular smooth muscle to the effects of catecholamines. In mildly acidemic condi-
tions (pH greater than 7.2), the effects of increased sympathetic stimulation predomi-
nate and result in a mild increase in heart rate and cardiac output. More severe
acidemia (pH below 7.1), especially if acute, may decrease cardiac contractility and
predispose the heart to ventricular dysrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation.
  Endocrine/Metabolic—Acidemia   produces  insulin  resistance  that  impairs
peripheral uptake of glucose and inhibits anaerobic glycolysis by inhibiting
phosphofructokinase.

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 Any breed, age, or sex of dogs and cats
Risk Factors/Causes
Pre-existing diseases with a high risk for metabolic acidosis
■Chronic renal failure
■ Diabetes mellitus
■Hypoadrenocorticism
■ Patients with poor tissue perfusion or hypoxia are at risk of developing lactic
acidosis.
Historical Findings
 History associated with chronic disease processes that may lead to metabolic acidosis
(e.g., renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypoadrenocorticism, or diarrhea)
 Exposure to toxins (e.g., ethylene glycol, salicylate, and paraldehyde)
CLINICAL FEATURES
Generally related to the underlying disease
 Depression in severely acidotic patients
 Tachypnea in some patients results from compensatory increase in ventilation.
■ Kussmaul's respiration, typically seen in human beings with metabolic acidosis, is
not commonly observed in dogs and cats.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Low plasma HCO and hyperchloremia may also be compensatory in animals with
chronic respiratory alkalosis, in which PCO, is low and pH is high or near normal,
despite decreased HCO3 and increase in chloride concentration. Blood gas determi-
nation is required to differentiate.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Blood gas analysis reveals low HCO3, low PCOz, and low pH.
■ Excessive heparin (>l0 percent of the sample) decreases HCO3 and the degree of
the acidosis may be overestimated.
■AG
Metabolic acidoses are traditionally divided into hyperchloremic and high
AG by means of the AG. AG, the difference between the measured cations
and the measured anions. is calculated as AG=Na+-(HCO+Cl-) or
AG =(Na++K+)-(HCO +Cl-), depending on the preference of the clinician or
laboratory. Normal values with potassium included in the calculation are usually
12 to 24mEq/L in dogs and 13 to 27 mEq/L in cats. The negative charges of
albumin are the major contributors to the normal AG; this should be taken into
account when evaluating AG in patients with hypoalbuminemia. At pH 7.4 in
dogs, a decrease of l g/dL in albumin is associated with a decrease of 4.l mEq/L
in the AG.
■ Normal AG: hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
 r i   o   i 
dosis, toxicities (e.g., ethylene glycol).
■Hyperglycemia—-consider diabetes mellitus.
■
Azotemia—-consider renal failure.
■ Hyperphosphatemia—consider renal failure, hypertonic sodium phosphate enema
toxicity, and toxicity due to urinary acidifiers containing phosphate.
■High lactate concentration—consider lactic acidosis associated with poor tissue per-
fusion or poor metabolism of lactate (e.g., liver disease and lymphoma).
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS469
Hyperkalemia—commonly associated with, but almost never caused by the acidosis
Hyperkalemia results from the disease process causing the metabolic acidosis (e.g.-
poor renal function in renal failure or lack of insulin in diabetes mellitus), not from
the acidosis itself. Correction formulas to adjust potassium concentration based on
pH changes should not be used.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Acid-base disturbances are secondary phenomena; successful resolution depends on
diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease process.
 Treat patients with blood pH < 7.l aggressively while pursuing the definitive
diagnosis.
■Discontinue drugs that may cause or contribute to metabolic acidosis.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ NaHCO may help patients with hyperchloremic, hyperphosphatemic or uremic
acidosis but not patients with lactic acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis.
■ Estimation of HCO dose: dogs, 0.3 × body weight (kg) × (21 - patient HCO);
cats, 0.3 × body weight (kg) × (19 - patient HCO). Give half of this dose slowly
IV and reevaluate blood gases before deciding on the need for additional admin-
istration. An empirical dose of 2mEq/kg followed by reevaluation of blood gas
status is safe in most patients.
■ Potential complications of NaHCO, administration: volume overload resulting
from administered sodium, tetany from low ionized calcium concentration,
 increased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, paradoxical CNS acidosis, overshoot
metabolic alkalosis, and hypokalemia.
 Hyperchloremic acidosis: NaHCO is effective and should be considered whenever
pH <7.2.
■ Uremic acidosis: Efficacy of NaHCO, in acute therapy of uremic acidosis is related
to the shift of phosphate inside the cells and consequent amelioration of hyperphos-
phatemic acidosis.
■ Lactic acidosis: NaHCO, increases lactate production and is of little to no value in
lactic acidosis. Therapy should be directed at augmenting oxygen delivery to the
tissues and reestablishing cardiac output. Small titrated doses of NaHCOg can be used
as a temporizing measure to maintain HCO above 5 mEq/L, if needed.
■ Diabetic ketoacidosis: NaHCO adversely affects outcome in humans with diabetic
ketoacidosis even when pH is below 7.0. Administration of NaHCO, to ketoacidotic
patients cannot be recommended at any pH. Therapy should be directed at insulin
and fluid administration. Reestablishing plasma volume and renal perfusion will
allow the kidneys to excrete ketoanions, replacing them with chloride.
470
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Precautions/Interactions
■Avoid NaHCO in patients with respiratory acidosis because it generates CO. Patients
with respiratory acidosis cannot adequately excrete COz, and increased PCO will
further decrease the pH.
■Avoid diuretics that act in the distal nephron (e.g., spironolactone).
■Avoid carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide).
■  Use NaHCO, cautiously in patients with congestive heart failure because the sodium
load may cause decompensation of the heart failure.
Activity
■ Restriction dictated by the underlying disease leading to metabolic acidosis
COMMENTS
Patient Monitoring
■  Acid-base status—frequency dictated by the underlying disease and patient response

Possible Complications
■  Myocardial depression and ventricular arrhythmias
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Prognosis is dependent on the severity of the underlying disease causing metabolic
 allkalosis and response to therapy.

Metabolic Alkalosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■Increase in pH associated with an increase in plasma HCO concentration
 i     (  <   t < )
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Metabolic alkalosis may develop secondary to corrected hypochloremia (hypochlo-
remic alkalosis) or hypoalbuminemia (hypoalbuminemic alkalosis). The most
common causes of metabolic alkalosis in critical care patients are presented in
Table 63.1.
1 Hypochloremic alkalosis
 Fluid rich in chloride and H+ may be lost via the alimentary tract (e.g., vomiting.
stomach drainage) or kidneys (e.g., diuretic therapy). Loss of chloride and H+ is
and volume depletion, the kidneys reabsorb sodium with HCO instead of chlo-
ride, perpetuating the metabolic alkalosis
■ Administration of fluids with high sodium and poor chloride concentration (e.g.-
sodium bicarbonate) also may result in transient metabolic alkalosis.
■
 Hypochloremic alkalosis is not common in dogs and cats in a critical care setting
and is usually secondary to vomiting or diuretic administration. Alkalemia is rare
unless the patient also has respiratory alkalosis
 Hypoalbuminemic alkalosis
■ Decrease in plasma weak acids (e.g., albumin) is associated with metabolic
alkalosis.
■ Hypoalbuminemic alkalosis is common in critically ill patients, but it rarely leads
to alkalemia. However, presence of hypoalbuminemia complicates identification
of increased unmeasured anions (e.g., lactate, ketoanions) because hypoalbumin.
emia decreases AG. At plasma pH of 7.4 in dogs, each decrease of 1 g/dL in albumin
concentration is associated with a decrease of 4.l mEq/L in the AG. Thus, the
severity of the underlying disease leading to metabolic acidosis may be underes-
timated if the effects of hypoalbuminemia on pH, HCO concentration, and AG
are not considered.

Systems Affected
■ Respiratory: Low H+ reduces alveolar ventilation. Hypoventilation increases PCOz
and helps offset the effects of high plasma HCO3 on pH. In dogs, an increase of
approximately 0.7 mm Hg in PCO can be expected for each 1 mEq/L increase in
plasma HCO. Limited data is available for cats, but the degree of respiratory com-
 pensation appears to be similar.
■Renal/Urologic: The kidneys rapidly and effectively excrete excessive alkali. In
patients with chloride deficiency (and less importantly, volume depletion), the
kidneys cannot excrete the excessive alkali and metabolic alkalosis is maintained. In
these patients, chloride administration is required for renal compensation to occur,
whereas volume expansion will hasten compensation.
■Nervous: Muscle twitching and seizures occur rarely in dogs. Metabolic alkalosis and
associated hypokalemia may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver
failure.

CLINICAL FEATURES
weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and ileus)
■Dehydration in volume-depleted patients
■ Muscle twitching and seizures in patients with neurologic involvement (rare)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ High plasma HCO and hypochloremia in animals can also be compensating for
chronic respiratory acidosis, in which PCO is high and pH is low despite high HCO3
and low chloride concentration; blood gas determination required to differentiate.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Metabolic alkalosis: Blood gas analysis reveals high HCO, high PCO, and high pH.
 Excessive heparin (>l0 percent of the sample) decreases HCO3 and the degree of
the alkalosis may be underestimated.
■Hypochloremic alkalosis: associated with a decrease in corrected chloride
concentration
■Hypoalbuminemic alkalosis: associated with a decrease in albumin concentration. In
vitro, a l g/dL decrease in albumin concentration is associated with an increase in
pH of 0.093 in cats and 0.047 in dogs.
Hypokalemia: Hypokalemia is common in patients with metabolic alkalosis. It likely
results from the metabolic alkalosis or the underlying problem (e.g., vomiting of
alkalosis does not occur in dogs and cats
476
THERAPEUTICS
■ Acid-base disturbances are secondary phenomena. Diagnosis and treatment of the
underlying disease process are integral to the successful resolution of acid-base
disorders.
■ Severe alkalemia is uncommon but may be life threatening. Patients with chronic
respiratory disease and respiratory alkalosis are at risk of developing severe alkalemia
if they start vomiting or receive diuretics.
■ Discontinue drugs that may cause metabolic alkalosis.
Drug(s) of Choice
■Hypochloremic alkalosis:
■ If there is evidence of volume depletion, the deficit should be repaired with a
chloride-containing fluid (e.g., 0.9% NaCl).
 If the metabolic alkalosis is associated with hypokalemia and total body potassium
deficits, correcting the deficit with KCl is a particularly effective way to reverse
the alkalosis.
■Hypoalbuminemic alkalosis:
■ Treatment for hypoalbuminemic alkalosis should be directed at the underlying
cause and the decreased colloid oncotic pressure.
Precautions/Interactions
■  In the absence of hypovolemia, the amount of saline required to correct hypochlo-
remic alkalosis introduces a risk for volume overload.
■ Avoid chloride-free fluids; they may correct volume depletion but will not correct
metabolic alkalosis
 Avoid using salts of potassium without chloride (e.g., potassium phosphate); potas-
sium will be excreted in the urine and will correct neither the alkalosis nor the
potassium deficit.
Alternative Drugs
■ Acetazolamide (5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours PO) can be used to as adjunct therapy for
the correction of metabolic alkalosis in critical care patients.

Metaldehyde Toxicosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Syndrome of toxicity that occurs in dogs and cats after ingestion of metaldehyde, a
common chemical in commercial slug baits.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Metaldehyde is a tetramer of acetaldehyde and is a common component of commer-
cial slug baits.
Mechanism of toxicity unknown in small animals.
LD50 is 100 mg/kg in dogs, and 207 mg/kg in cats. Clinical signs can occur after
ingestion of 2 mg/kg. Clinical signs of toxicity can occur within minutes to several
hours after ingestion.
Proposed mechanism of toxicity involves the conversion of metaldehyde to acetal-
dehyde in the stomach when exposed to an acidic environment, with possible
decreased concentrations of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, decreased nor-
epinephrine, and decreased 5-HT. The decreased concentration of inhibitory neu-
rotransmitters has been linked with increased incidence of seizure activity and death.
Systems Affected
■ Neurologic—nystagmus, muscle rigidity, tremors, opisthotonus, hyperesthesia, and
seizures. Transient blindness has been reported.
 Musculoskeletal—muscle rigidity and tremors or fasciculations
■ Gastrointestinal—vomiting and diarrhea
 Metabolic—respiratory alkalosis from panting, metabolic acidosis, or hyperthermia
 Respiratory—panting, respiratory depression and failure within hours of ingestion/
exposure
■Hepatobiliary—-hepatic failure delayed up to 2 to 3 days after exposure
Incidence/Prevalence
■Unknown

Activated Charcoal
■ Prevent further absorption, repeat every 6 to 8 hours as long as patient is able to
swallow and has an intact gag reflex.
■Administer dose according to manufacturer's recommendations.
■ Sorbitol-containing activated charcoal solutions or concentrate may promote elimi-
nation from gastrointestinal tract but should be avoided in animals with diarrhea
and vomiting.
Intravenous Crystalloid Fluids
 Dose is dependent on degree of hyperthermia, dehydration, and acid-base and elec-
trolyte abnormalities. Make sure to correct fluid deficits, acid-base and electrolyte
abnormalities, and provide maintenance needs
Anti-Emetics
Dolasetron (0.6 mg/kg IV every 24 hours)

Murmurs
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
1 Vibrations caused by disturbed blood flow
Timing of Murmurs
Systolic murmurs occur between Sl and S2 (systole).
 Diastolic murmurs occur between S2 and Sl (diastole).
■ Continuous and to-and-fro murmurs occur throughout all or most of the cardiac
cycle.
Continuous murmurs are usually accentuated near S2 and to-and-fro murmurs are
usually absent near S2.
Grading Scale for Murmurs
■ Grade I—-barely audible
■
Grade Il—soft, but easily auscultated. Does not radiate far from PMI
■ Grade IIl—intermediate loudness; heard easily some distance from PMl, but not
   s   n     s
grade III.
■ Grade IV—loud murmur radiating widely, often including opposite side of chest
■ Grade V—very loud, audible with stethoscope barely touching the chest; palpable
thrill
■ Grade Vl—very loud, audible without the stethoscope touching the chest; palpable
thrill
Configuration
 Plateau murmurs have uniform loudness and are typical of regurgitant murmurs such
as mitral and tricuspid insufficiency and ventricular septal defect.
 Crescendo-decrescendo murmurs get louder and then softer and are typical of ejec-
tion murmurs such as pulmonic and aortic stenosis and atrial septal defect.
1 Decrescendo murmurs start loud and then get softer and are typical of diastolic
murmurs such as aortic or pulmonic insufficiency and mitral or tricuspid
stenosis.

Murmurs vary in loudness, radiation, and PMl depending on the cause and severity.
Evaluation of jugular and femoral pulses may be helpful in narrowing the differential
diagnosis (e.g.. jugular pulse with tricuspid insufficiency, bb shot pulse with patent
ductus arteriosus).
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Differential Signs
■Must differentiate from other abnormal heart sounds—split sounds, ejection sounds,
gallop rhythms, and clicks
 Must differentiate from abnormal lung sounds and pleural rubs; listen to see if timing
of abnormal sound is correlated with respiration or heartbeat.
Differential Causes
■ Pale mucous membranes support diagnosis of anemic murmur.
■ Location and radiation of murmur and timing during cardiac cycle can help deter-
mine cause.
Svstolic Murmurs
■ Mitral and tricuspid valve endocardiosis

Age-Related Factors
■ Murmurs present since birth generally associated with a congenital defect or physi-
ologic flow murmur
■ Acquired murmurs in geriatric, small-breed dogs usually associated with degenera-
tive valve disease
■ Acquired  murmurs
in large-breed dogs usually associated  with dilated
cardiomyopathy
■ Acquired murmurs in geriatric cats usually associated with cardiomyopathy or
hyperthyroidism
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
Anemia in animals with anemic murmurs
■ Polycythemia in animals with right-to-left shunting congenital defects
■ Leukocytosis with left shift in animals with endocarditis
Imaging
■ Thoracic radiography is useful for evaluating heart size and pulmonary vasculature
in hopes of determining cause and significance of murmur
■  Echocardiography is recommended when a cardiac cause is suspected and the nature
 of the defect is unknown
■ Doppler studies sometimes required to confirm cause of murmur
Diagnostic Procedures
■ Electrocardiography may be useful in assessing heart enlargement patterns in animals
with murmurs.
■ Blood cultures and serology for Bartonella if suspect endocarditis
MURMURS
489
Pathologic Features
  Vary with underlying cause of the murmur
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
■None unless heart failure has developed secondary to the disease process causing the
murmur or if the murmur is secondary to endocarditis
Diet
■ Sodium restriction if in congestive heart failure
Surgical Considerations
 Surgery or interventional cardiology procedures may be options in cases of patent
ductus arteriosus, pulmonic stenosis, aortic stenosis, or congenital mitral valve
disease. Consultation with a veterinary cardiologist is recommended prior to surgical
intervention.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Murmurs are associated with many conditions, some benign and others serious
Echocardiography may be required if the cause of the murmur is not obvious from
the history and physical examination.
Patient Monitoring
  Low-grade systolic ejection murmurs in puppies may be physiologic; most resolve
by 6 months of age. If murmur is still present after 6 months, include diagnostic
imaging.
Possible Complications
■ If murmur is associated with structural heart disease, may see signs of congestive
heart failure (e.g., coughing, dyspnea, and ascites) or exercise intolerance.
Expected Course and Prognosis
  Varies with underlying cause

Mycotoxins-Aflatoxins
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■Aflatoxins are metabolites produced by fungi (Aspergillus and Penicillium spp.) that
may cause acute hepatic failure.
 Uncommonly diagnosed in dogs, however, outbreaks involving more than 100 cases
have been reported.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Fungal invasion and toxin production in crops during the growing season, during
harvest, or during transportation and storage result in accumulation of aflatoxin.
 Despite random screening for aflatoxins by most pet food manufacturers, small
amounts often reach the final product undetected.
 Aflatoxins are absorbed via the Gl tract and subsequently sequestered in the liver.
 Most dogs require several days to weeks of exposure prior to developing clinical
signs of toxicity, although sudden acute intoxication is reported.
Evidence suggests aflatoxins bind and interfere with DNA, RNA, and protein function
leading to carcinogenic, teratogenic, mutagenic and acute hepatotoxic effects.
 Aflatoxin Bl is most frequently reported to cause toxicity.
Systems Affected
Hepatobiliary—-Aflatoxins accumulate in the liver.
■ Gl—Gl ulcers and hemorrhage occur frequently via an unknown mechanism of
action.
■ Hemic—Aflatoxins are reported to have a Coumadin-like effect that may contribute
to the frequent occurrence of hypocoagulable states.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 Young and pregnant animals appear to be more susceptible.

492
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Outbreaks—accidental inclusion of contaminated corn during the manufacturing
 process or improper preparation of commercial dog foods
 Individual cases may occur following ingestion of moldy food (particularly bread).
■
Warm humid conditions promote mold growth and aflatoxin production.
■ Low moisture content in pet foods decreases the risk of mold growth.
Historical Findings
 Feeding moldy commercial pet food or ingesting other moldy foods such as bread
 Change in brands or recently opening a new bag of dog food
■
 Anorexia
 Depression
Vomiting
Polydipsia
 Polyuria
 Discoloration of the eyes and mucous membranes
■
Initial signs are often vague and insidious in onset.
■Animals may exhibit an aversion to the contaminated food for several days prior to
the development of clinical signs.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■
Acute hepatic failure in multiple dogs from the same region or sharing the same food
source should prompt a strong suspicion of aflatoxicosis.
■ Severity of signs varies depending on the length of exposure and concentration of
the aflatoxins ingested.
■ Most often related to acute liver failure

DIAGNOSTICS
 Evaluate suspected feeds for the presence of aflatoxins, even if macroscopic evidence
of mold is not detectable.
 Liver samples can be submitted for aflatoxin testing.
■]
 Liver enzymes elevated
 Bilirubin increased
■
 Bile acids increased
ACT, PT, and PTT often prolonged
■
 Antithrombin and protein C levels decreased; not specific to aflatoxicosis
 Dilute urine; granular casts may develop as toxicity progresses.
Pathological Findings
■ No pathognomonic findings
Hepatic cytology reveals microvesicular fatty vacuolation.
Histologic findings include hepatic centrilobular necrosis, bile duct proliferation.
fibrosis, hepatocellular fatty degeneration, and megalocytosis.
 Gross pathologic changes include generalized icterus, liver damage, ascites, wide-
spread hemorrhage, and gallbladder edema.
Renal proximal tubular necrosis has also been reported on histologic examination
494
THERAPEUTICS
■ There is no specific antidote.
■ Treatment is directed toward limiting further hepatic injury, maximizing hepatic
recovery, and supportive care.
■  Intravenous fluids to correct dehydration, provide maintenance requirements and
allow for ongoing losses
Drug(s) of choice
■ Evidence-based medicine to support therapies in clinically occurring aflatoxicosis
are lacking.
■ SAMe 20 mg/kg PO once a day on an empty stomach
■ Metoclopramide (l-2 mg/kg per day IV as a CR1) starting at low doses and tapering
upward to effect until vomiting is controlled
■ Ondansetron (0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV as a slow bolus twice or four times a day) if meto-
clopramide is not effective
 Famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV once to twice a day) if hematemesis or melena is present
Sucralfate (0.5-l g PO three times a day) if hematemesis or melena is present
■  Packed red blood cells if significant hemorrhage is present or there are clinical signs
associated with anemia
■Vitamin Kl may be helpful (0.5-1.5 mg/kg SQ or PO every 12 to 24 hours) if coagu-
lation times prolonged
■  Plasma transfusions to correct coagulopathies when present (10-15 ml/kg IV given
over 2-4 hours)
Alternative Drugs
■ Although unproven in dogs, milk thistle [(silibinin-phosphatidylcholine complex)
2-5 mg/kg PO once daily] may be beneficial.
1 N-acetylcysteine may be hepatoprotective if SAMe cannot be given (l40 mg/kg IV
 given slowly as a loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every 6 hours until SAMe can
be given orally); administer via a microfilter.
Diet
Parenteral nutrition may be required with protracted vomiting.
COMMENTS
■ Save samples (air tight containers or frozen) of suspect foods and Gl contents for
analysis.
MYCOTOXINS—AFLATOXINS
495
 Save package information (product and date codes) to expedite proper identification
of contaminated foods.
 Proper authorities should be contacted (product manufacturer and FDA consumer
complaints coordinator or equivalent) if intoxication is linked to commercial pet
foods.
Patient Monitoring
■Monitor for hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathies.
in response to therapy.
 Serum electrolytes and the hematocrit
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Discontinue all commercial dog foods and consider boiled rice and chicken until
clinical signs of toxicity resolve.
■Avoid grossly moldy, discolored, or malodorous dog foods
Possible Complications
 Aflatoxins are carcinogenic and immunosuppressive following chronic exposure.
■ Long-term complications may include hepatic cancer and chronic liver failure.
Expected course and Prognosis
 Prognosis varies with amount of toxin ingested and length of exposure.
 Prognosis is guarded to poor if signs of hepatic failure develop.
Animals that recover will often do so within 3 to 5 days.
 Aflatoxins may bind albumin and have delayed toxic effects; administration of oral
hepatoprotectants for up to 60 days has been suggested.

Mycotoxins-Tremorgens
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Fungal metabolites found in moldy foods and garbage that can induce signs of CNS
excitation when ingested
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Ingested and absorbed via the Gl tract
 Excretion in the bile, enterohepatic recirculation, and continued reabsorption may
prolong the signs of toxicity.
 Iwo known tremorgens reported to cause toxicity in dogs: penitrem A and roque-
fortine C, both are produced by Penicillium spp. of fungi.
1 The two mycotoxins may act synergistically if ingested together.
Systems Affected
■ NeuromuscularExact mechanism of action unknown, although interference with
neurotransmitter release at central and peripheral nerve synapses is suspected
■ GI—Secondary to an unknown mechanism of action of the mycotoxins or the result
of ingesting other vomitogenic materials in conjunction with the mycotoxins
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ One of the more common intoxications occurring naturally in dogs
1
 Probably underdiagnosed in the veterinary profession
■ No known cases reported in cats
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Free-roaming dogs that have access to garbage are likely to be at higher risk.
Historical Findings
 Ingestion of moldy foods or garbage, including dairy products, nuts, grains, bread.

■]
 Dysmyelination
■ Metabolic disorders
■ Infectious diseases
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Laboratory analysis of the vomit, stomach/intestinal contents, or gastric lavage con-
tents of suspected animals provides a definitive diagnosis.
 Moldy food samples can also be submitted for tremorgenic toxin analysis.
Screen for other common neurologic toxins if tremorgenic toxins are not confirmed
on laboratory analysis.
■
 The minimum database should include a complete blood count, biochemistry panel,
and urinalysis to rule out other causes of tremors and seizures.
  Increased levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and creatinine kinase have been
reported with tremorgenic mycotoxicosis, which occurs secondary to increased
muscle activity.
Pathological Findings
■ There are no typical findings on gross or histologic examinations.
THERAPEUTICS
■
 The goals of therapy are to minimize absorption of the mycotoxin from the Gl tract,
control the tremors and seizures, and provide supportive care.
■ Induction of vomiting gastric lavage, and activated charcoal may limit Gl absorption
sn       so      
pneumonia.
 Active cooling (application of soaked towels and the use of fans) should be initiated
if the temperature is greater than 4l° C (stop active cooling efforts when the
temperature falls to 39.5° C to avoid overshoot hypothermia, and monitor the
patient closely to identify  the development of hypothermia or recurrent
hyperthermia).
■  Intravenous fluids should be provided to maintain normal hydration status.
Drug(s) of choice
■ Pentobarbital (3-15mg/kg IV administered to effect) and methocarbamol (55-
220mg/kg IV administered slowly to effect at a rate <200mg/min) are currently
recommended to control tremor-like activity.
■ Pentobarbital can cause heavy sedation and appropriate monitoring is required.
 Methocarbamol provides muscle relaxation.
Precautions/Interactions
sedation to control tremors.
■  Animals with active tremors and seizures should not have gastric lavage or activated
charcoal administered until CNS excitement can be controlled.
■ If medications to control the CNS excitement cause severe sedation and suppression
of the gag reflex, administration of activated charcoal and gastric lavage should be
 approached with great care due to the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
Alternative Drugs
■ Diazepam can be tried, however, when given alone it may be insufficient at control-
ling severe mycotoxin induced tremors.
COMMENTS
■  Perform gastric lavage only under general anesthesia with cuffed endotracheal tube
in place to prevent aspiration of gastric contents.
 Some affected animals can be intubated with minimal sedation.
 Patients under anesthesia should be endotracheally intubated and often require ven-
tilation (monitor respiratory function)
■ Activated charcoal can be administered by orogastric tube.
Patient Monitoring
■ Monitor for continued tremor activity for at least 24 hours and treat as needed
■ Monitor temperature: hyperthermia may occur with uncontrolled tremors or hypo-
thermia may develop following pentobarbital administration and subsequent
sedation.
■ Monitor respiratory rate and effort, level of sedation, and the presence or absence of
a gag reflex following administration of pentobarbital and other sedatives.
Arterial or venous blood gas analysis should be performed to evaluate acid-base status
and carbon dioxide levels if there are concerns of hypoventilation
■  Thoracic radiographs and arterial blood gas analysis should be performed if there is
a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia.
MYCOTOXINS—TREMORGENS
501
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Proper disposal of moldy food products and preventing animals from accessing
garbage will decrease occurrence of tremorgenic mycotoxicosis.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■Varies with the severity of symptoms and promptness of therapy
■
Most dogs make a complete recovery within 2 to 3 days.
 Death has been reported in severe cases with uncontrollable convulsions.
■ Concurrent aspiration pneumonia can contribute to significant morbidity and mor-
tality and every precaution should be undertaken to avoid this complication.

Noncardiogenic Pulmonary Edema
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
The accumulation of abnormal fluid and solutes in the pulmonary interstitium and
alveoli in the absence of heart disease
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Common cause of all forms: increased pulmonary vascular permeability, associated
with leakage of fluid, proteins, and other solutes into the interstitium and alveoli
Several proposed mechanisms depending on underlying cause:
■ Massive sympathetic discharge causes release of catecholamines, leading to sys-
temic vasoconstriction, increased afterload, and temporary shunting of blood into
the pulmonary circulation, this leads to transient pulmonary circulatory overload
and endothelial damage; proposed mechanism for neurogenic edema, electric cord
bites, and upper airway obstruction
■ Severe decrease in intrathoracic pressure induced by inspiratory attempts against
an airway obstruction; proposed mechanism for upper airway obstruction
 Hypoxia leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased permeability of
microvasculature.
 Direct chemical or inflammatory mediator damage (circulating histamine, comple-
ment, cytokines, or inhaled/ingested toxins) leads to endothelial damage and
■ For all forms, the inciting insult may trigger an inflammatory response cascade that
often worsens in the first 24 hours after the initial episode; the most severe form is
known as ARDS.
 Severity of clinical manifestation varies ranging from mild to severe; the most seri-
ously affected patients may progress from normal to death in as little as a couple of
hours after the incident
■ Overall incidence/prevalence is uncommon
Systems Affected
 Respiratory—decreased compliance, atelectasis, decreased FRC, tracheal narrowing
Hemic/lymphatic/immune—if severe and causing respiratory failure, may be associ
ated with DlC and hypoproteinemia due to loss of protein into the pulmonary
parenchyma
503
504
■ Cardiovascular—hypotension, tachycardia, other dysrhythmias, and shock
■ Renal/Urologic—acute renal failure
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Species: mainly dogs, occasionally cats
■ No confirmed breed or sex predilection; brachycephalic dogs are more prone to
airway obstruction.
■ Higher incidence in puppies younger than l year old
■ Young animals—associated with strangulation, head trauma, and electric cord bites
■ Old—associated with laryngeal obstruction, neoplasia, and seizures
■No known genetic basis for the disease
■ Respiratory signs vary depending on underlying cause and severity.
Risk Factors/Causes
■Hypoproteinemia
 Crystalloid fluid resuscitation
 Upper airway obstruction—brachycephalic, laryngeal paralysis; leash/choke-chain/
■Electric shock
■  Acute neurologic disease—head trauma; prolonged seizures
 Pulmonary and other neoplasia
Drugs (i.e., ketamine, other anesthetics)
Chemicals (i.e., chlorine, minoxidil, waterproofing hydrocarbons)
Blood transfusions (including human albumin in healthy dogs)
 Uremic toxins
■ SIRS—sepsis, pancreatitis, and endotoxemia
■ Smoke inhalation
Anaphylaxis (cats)
■Hyperosmolar fluid/sea water inhalation/near drowning
HISTORICAL FINDINGS
■Predisposing cause
■ Acute onset of respiratory distress
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Mild to severe respiratory distress
■ Increased respiratory rate and effort; open-mouthed breathing
NONCARDIOGENIC PULMONARY EDEMA
505
1 Postural adaptations to respiratory distress in severe cases (e.g., orthopnea, neck
extension)
■ Restlessness, unwillingness to lie down
 Pale or cyanotic mucous membranes (severe)
■Harsh lung sounds (early, mild) or generalized crackles (late, severe) on
auscultation
 Expectoration of pink froth or bubbles in severely affected animals; in intubated
patients, large volumes of bloody fluid can flow out through the endotracheal tube.
 Normal cardiac auscultation; may note dysrhythmias; tachycardia common
■ Possible oral burns if due to electric shock
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema
 Pulmonary infection-bacterial, viral, or fungal pneumonia
 Pulmonary neoplasia
 Pulmonary hemorrhage
 Pulmonary thromboembolism
Many of the above can occur concurrently with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ CBC—leukocytosis but possibly leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, owing to neu-
trophil sequestration in the lung and platelet consumption
 Biochemistries—usually normal; may note hypoalbuminemia owing to pulmonary
protein loss; mild hyperglycemia reported
 Urinalysis—usually normal
Arterial blood gas analysis—usually demonstrates mild to severe hypoxemia and
hypocapnia; results are not specific but indicate the severity of pulmonary
dysfunction
 Coagulation testing (severely affected patients)—may reveal mild to moderate pro-
longation of PT and PTT because of consumption of coagulation factors and DIC
Thoracic radiographs—vital; may simply reveal prominent interstitial pattern with
mild or early disease; may note alveolar infiltrates with moderate or severe disease;
alveolar infiltrates in the dorsocaudal lung fields common; alveolar infiltrates may
be seen in other lung fields, are often asymmetrical and may demonstrate predomi-
nant right-sided involvement (See Figure 68.1)
 Echocardiography—rule out cardiogenic pulmonary edema
 Computed tomography—optional to rule out differential diagnoses such as pulmo-
nary neoplasia or thromboembolism, however may be contraindicated due to need
for anesthesia
506
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
 Figure 68.1 Right lateral thoracic radiograph of 15-week-old puppy with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema
secondary to strangulation
■  Pulse oximetry—noninvasive, continuous monitoring of arterial hemoglobin satura-
tion; provides information about  the severity and progression of pulmonary
dysfunction
■ Pulmonary artery wedge pressure—confirms noncardiogenic origin; uncommonly
used in small animal clinical patients
■ ETL, TTW or BAL—if it can be safely performed, may demonstrate neutrophilic
inflammation and cytologic evaluation may help rule out pneumonia of bacterial or
fungal origin; culture can confrm presence or absence of infection.
Pathologic Findings
 Lungs-may be heavy, red, or congested; may fail to collapse; may exhibit a wet cut
surface; may note foam in the major airways
Histopathologic—-depend on severity of the insult; early mild: may note eosinophilic
amorphous material filling the alveoli or may be near normal because fluid removed
in processing: severe: alveolar hyaline membranes, alveolitis, and interstitial inflam-
matory infiltrates with neutrophils and macrophages evident and accompanied by
atelectasis, vascular congestion, and hemorrhage; may be found only hours after a
severe insult
THERAPEUTICS
 Inpatient versus outpatient—depends on the severity of respiratory dysfunction and
cause (e.g., dogs with upper airway obstruction, severe seizures, or pancreatitis may
require hospitalization)
■TIreat the underlying cause (e.g., relieve airway obstruction or treat seizures)
NONCARDIOGENIC PULMONARY EDEMA507
■Mild to moderate—patients generally improve on their own within 24 to 48 hours
with complete resolution; offer support of pulmonary and cardiovascular function
while the lung repairs
 Severe—difficult to treat; may require PPV because of respiratory failure, plasma
transfusions to treat DlC; many die despite extensive supportive care
 Damaged endothelium in the pulmonary  vasculature—no  specific treatment
available
1 Inflammatory response—generated by a variety of mediators and cascades; cannot
be blocked by one specific anti-inflammatory drug that leads to resolution of the
edema
  Oxygen therapy—-vital in moderate to severe disease, administer via a mask or hood,
oxygen concentration depends on the severity of disease; most patients do well on
40 to 50 percent oxygen, but severe disease may require 80 to 100 percent to sustain
life
■Fluid therapy with a balanced electrolyte—give as replacement solution with dehy-
dration or shock
■ Plasma or synthetic colloids—consider with hypoproteinemia, coagulopathy or to
improve oncotic pressure, minimizing movement of fluid into the lungs
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Diuretics—often ineffective; edema caused by changes in permeability not high
hydrostatic pressure; may use furosemide cautiously in boluses of 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg
IV, IM or at 0.1 to 1 mg/kg per hour IV in a continuous infusion
■ Corticosteroids—minimize airway swelling in animals with upper airway obstruc-
tion; generally ineffective for pulmonary inflammatory response; may predispose
patients to infectious complications (e.g., bacterial pneumonia); if used, recommend
an anti-inflammatory dosage of a short-acting drug (e.g., dexamethasone sodium
phosphate at 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV)
Precautions/Interactions
■ Minimize stress in animals with respiratory distress.
■
Severe—may require PPV and PEEP
 Aggressive fluid therapy can worsen pulmonary edema: increased circulating volume
results in increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary microvasculature, worsen-
ing the pulmonary vascular leakage.
 Excessive use of diuretics may cause dehydration and a marked decrease in intravas-
cular volume with minimal resolution of edema that may exacerbate cardiovascular
collapse or shock.
Activity
  Rest and minimal stress vital for minimizing oxygen requirements in moderately to
severely affected animals

Surgical Considerations
■Relevant only for treating the underlying cause
COMMENTS
Client Education
■Warn client that the condition may worsen before improving.
■ Inform client that severe disease, which progresses rapidly to fulminant pulmonary
edema and respiratory failure, is associated with a very poor prognosis.
Patient Monitoring
■ Observe respiratory rate and pattern and auscultate frequently (every 2-4 hr) for the
first 24 to 48 hours.
■ Assess pulmonary function by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis (initially
every 2-4hr).
■ Perform PCV and total solids and evaluate mucous membranes, pulse quality, heart
rate, ECG, blood pressure, and urine output every 2 to 4 hours to assess cardiovas-
cular status and progression to shock.
■ In severely affected animals, monitor renal function, coagulation status, and white
blood cell count.
■Recheck thoracic radiographs to evaluate resolution and monitor for other contribut-
ing pulmonary disease.
Prevention/Avoidance
 Avoid contact with electric wire.
 Correct airway obstruction.
■Treat seizures or high intracranial pressure
Possible Complications
■ Usually none if patient recovers from acute crisis
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Mild to moderate—uneventful resolution of signs in 24 to 72 hours; no specific
■ Severe—progression to ARDS usually results in mortality within 1 to 2 days
■ Overall survival rates—80 to 100 percent. In electric shock, mortality up to 40
percent in dogs if severe, cats typically excellent prognosis
■ Long-term prognosis—excellent for recovered patients

Organophosphate Toxicity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
OPs and CMs are anticholinesterase chemicals used most commonly as household
and industrial insecticides; they can cause toxicity in humans and veterinary species.
 OP exposure in dogs and cats is by ingestion, dermal contact, or inhalation.
■
 The dose required for OP intoxication and lethality varies significantly by specific
compound.
1
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 OP and CM compounds cause toxicity by inhibiting the action of acetylcholinesterase
at neuronal synapses and the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholinesterase is the
enzyme that degrades acetylcholine, and thus prevents overstimulation of neurons
and muscles for which acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine plays a
stimulatory role at the skeletal neuromuscular junction, the parasympathetic neuro-
muscular junction, synapses of the autonomic nervous system, and some areas of
the CNs. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase leads to overstimulation of the skeletal
neuromuscular junction, parasympathetic system, and occasionally the sympathetic
nervous system and can have variable effects on the CNs. Thus, clinical signs of
acute OP or CM toxicity in dogs and cats involve skeletal muscle, the parasympa-
thetic nervous system, and the CNS.
1 OP and CM compounds are available in many housepets' environments. These
chemicals are used commonly in household insecticides, mixed fertilizer/insecticide
preparations, and in some over-the-counter flea and tick products for topical use
directly on dogs and cats. Both dogs and cat are susceptible to intoxication.
 OPs are most commonly associated with acute toxicity as described here. However,
OPs have also been associated with OP-induced delayed neuropathy and the inter-
mediate syndrome, both of which are uncommon. More information on these syn-
Systems Affected
■ Nervous—Muscle tremors and twitching are common. Eventually, weakness to
paralysis may occur. Obtundation is common; seizures to coma can be seen in severe
cases.

512 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Gastrointestinal—Hypersalivation, vomiting. diarrhea, and abdominal pain are
common. Rarely, acute pancreatitis may occur in the dog.
■ Ophthalmic—Miosis is common, and can help distinguish OP or CM intoxication
 from that caused by other tremorgens. Lacrimation (excessive tearing) may also be
present.
tion and bronchorrhea (excessive bronchial secretions), which can lead to respiratory
distress and life-threatening hypoxemia. Diaphragmatic function may be impaired in
severe cases.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Both dogs and cats of all ages and breeds are susceptible to OP and CM
intoxication.
■ Clinical signs usually occur within 30 minutes to 6 hours after chemical ingestion
or inhalation.
■ Time for dermal absorption can vary, but clinical signs may be present within a few
hours.
■ Clients may be aware of OP or CM exposure, such as in the case of purposeful
topical insecticide application on the animal. However, clients may still answer
"No" when asked generally if toxins are available in the environment, even when
the exposure was through bathing or insecticide in the garden. Therefore.
when the clinician has a high index of suspicion for OP or CM toxicity based
on physical examination, it may be helpful to ask the client specific questions
about flea and tick treatments, exposure to public gardens, and chemical use in the
yard.
Risk Factors/Causes
Household insecticides, garden insecticides, and chemicals used to topically treat flea
or tick infestation on dogs and cats are the most common sources of exposure to
OPs and CMs for housepets.
Historical Findings
■ Occasionally clients are aware of historical application of a topical insecticide or
exposure to environmental insecticide products.
              
plaints of acute muscle tremors, ataxia, hypersalivation, or gastrointestinal distur-
bance of unknown etiology.
ORGANOPHOSPHATE TOXICITY
513
CLINICAL FEATURES
 Physical examination most commonly reveals generalized muscle tremors; seizures
to coma may be present.
1 Clinical signs of parasympathetic overdrive are common, and include DUMBELS:
■D: diarrhea
■U: urination
■M: miosis
■B: bradycardia/bronchospasm
■E: emesis
 L: lacrimation
■S: salivation
■ Bronchospasm and excessive bronchial secretions can lead to life-threatening
hypoxemia.
Organophosphate or CM intoxication should be considered a top rule out in patients
with acute onset generalized tremors in combination with these parasympathetic
signs.
  Not all signs are present in all patients.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Some other toxins that can cause similar clinical signs include serotonergics; Penitrem
A, roquefortine, and other mycotoxins; metaldehyde; strychnine; many toxic
plants; nicotine; some illicit drugs: and pyrethrins and some other insecticide
compounds.
 Other differentials for OP or CM toxicity include nontoxic conditions such as inflam-
matory, infectious, idiopathic, and degenerative diseases of the CNS; neuromuscular
diseases; and metabolic diseases that affect the neurologic system.
DIAGNOSTICS
A tentative diagnosis can be made through consideration of signalment and historical
data in combination with physical examination findings.
 Clinicopathologic data are nonspecific and therefore generally noncontributory:
abnormalities can include azotemia, hematuria, leukocytosis, elevated serum creatine
kinase concentration, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia.
Whole blood can be submitted to determine blood cholinesterase activity, activ-
ity < 50 percent is suspicious for intoxication, whereas activity <25 percent is
confirmatory.
■ Definitive diagnosis requires toxicologic examination of blood, gastric contents.
urine, or source material. Contact a veterinary toxicology laboratory to confirm
sample handling procedures for whole blood cholinesterase activity and toxin
identification.
THERAPEUTICS
■Supportive care is imperative for the intoxicated patient.
■ Oxygen should be supplemented to animals with respiratory distress or tachypnea
Patients with severe hypoxemia or poor diaphragmatic function (and subsequent
  a os

  asop diu oi paau aq   p sd ao po p
aspiration.
■  Decontamination strategies should be used to decrease systemic absorption of OP or
CM toxins, when possible.
■ Induction of vomiting is important for animals that have ingested toxin within
the past 1 to 2 hours but is less useful in animals whose exposure occurred prior
to that time.
  Animals with neurologic abnormalities and those that have already vomited should
not be made to vomit.
ration in animals with clinical signs must be weighed against the benefits.
■ Patients with the potential for topical exposure should be bathed with mild soap
and water as soon as their clinical condition allows; they should be dried com-
from gastrointestinal decontamination because they may have ingested some toxin
during grooming, and enterohepatic circulation of the systemic toxin can occur
even if initial exposure is topical.
■ Antidotes are available for the muscarinic (parasympathetic) and nicotinic (skeletal
muscle) signs of OP and CM toxicity. They can be used in addition to, but cannot
replace, supportive care and good clinical judgment.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Supportive care should be provided, as clinically indicated, with supplemental
oxygen, intravenous fluids, and gastrointestinal support.
■ Seizures should be treated with diazepam 0.5 to 1 mg/kg (0.23-0.45 mg/lb) IV or
another benzodiazepine at an appropriate dose.
ORGANOPHOSPHATE TOXICITY515
1Activated charcoal can be administered at 1 to 4g/kg (0.45-1.8g/lb) and may be
given once or repeated every 6 hours for the first day after exposure to bind any
such as sorbitol should be avoided to help prevent electrolyte and acid-base
abnormalities.
 Atropine is the most useful antidote and is used to treat the potentially life-threat-
ening muscarinic signs of bradycardia, bronchospasm, and excessive bronchial secre.
tions. The initial atropine dose of 0.1 to 2 mg/kg (0.05-0.91 mg/lb) should be given
one-fourth IV and the remainder SQ. The dose is based on severity of the muscarinic
signs. Adequate treatment leads to clinical signs of atropinization: mydriasis, dry
mouth, and mild sinus tachycardia. Depending on the severity of intoxication, atro-
pine may need to be repeated every 20 to 30 minutes at smaller doses of 0.1 to 0.25
(0.05-0.1l mg/lb) to achieve or maintain atropinization
■ 2-PAM is an antidote for the nicotinic signs of acute, moderate to severe OP or CM
toxicity. It has little impact on CNS or muscarinic signs. The efficacy of 2-PAM is
debated, and the drug may be most beneficial with concurrent atropinization. 2-PAM
can worsen clinical signs of mild OP or CM toxicity, so is not recommended in those
cases. Patients should be monitored closely during 2-PAM administration and
the drug discontinued if clinical signs worsen during treatment. The 2-PAM dose is
       
hours. Refer to the package insert for information on drug compatibility and
administration.
Precautions/Interactions
 Emesis should not be induced if ingestion occurred more than 2 hours prior; if the
animal has neurologic impairment or other cause for increased risk of aspiration or
if the animal has already vomited.
1 Patients that present with tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia rather than the classic
bradycardia should be monitored closely if they require atropinization for broncho-
spasm or bronchial secretions (this seems an unlikely scenario).
■Animals with bradycardia should probably not be treated with medications known
to cause bradycardia (i.e., opiates, anesthetics) until they have been atropinized and
have normal heart rates.
■The major precaution when treating a patient with 2-PAM is that it may exacerbate
clinical signs of intoxication, in which case it should be discontinued.
Alternative Drugs
■ Glycopyrrolate may be used if atropine is not available, though it has a slower
onset of action than atropine. An appropriate starting dose would be 0.05 mg/kg
(0.02 mg/lb) IV.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ All OPs and CMs should be removed from the pet's environment.
Patient Monitoring
■ Patients should be monitored closely in hospital for resolution or worsening of mus-
carinic, nicotinic, and CNS signs.
■Vital signs should be checked frequently, and a continuous ECG is helpful to monitor
for brady- or tachycardia.
■Blood pressure should be measured until the animal is stabilized.
 Pulse oximetry or PaO may be used to assess patient oxygenation status, and arterial
or venous PCO, can be used to check for hypoventilation due to diaphragmatic
weakness.
■ Time to resolution varies by severity of intoxication, but usually takes l to 3 days if
the patient is adequately decontaminated.
■ Once the animal is home, further monitoring is generally not required as long as the
toxic source is removed from the environment.
Prevention/Avoidance
 All OPs and CMs should be removed from the pet's environment.
Possible Complications
 Acute OP toxicity has been associated with acute pancreatitis in humans. There is
evidence that it could cause acute pancreatitis in dogs but probably not in cats.
 Other complications could include development of intermediate syndrome following
 the acute crisis or more typical complications such as aspiration pneumonia from
hypersalivation or vomiting.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Clinical course depends on the severity of intoxication and varies from mild clinical
signs with need for only brief observation to a severe clinical syndrome with need
for longer hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and a high risk of death. Regardless
of initial clinical course, if the animal survives the acute crisis, prognosis for full
recovery is good, as development of intermediate syndrome appears to be rare in
dogs and cats.

 Anticholinesterase intoxication or toxicity; carbamate intoxication or toxicity.

Pancreatitis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Acute pancreatitis—pancreatic inflammation that occurs suddenly.
nent morphologic change (i.e., exocrine pancreatic insufficiency).
  Pancreatic abscess--in dogs: typically sterile; in cats: may be sterile or septic.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Host defense mechanisms normally prevent pancreatic autodigestion by pancreatic
enzymes, but under select circumstances these defenses fail; autodigestion occurs
when digestive enzymes are activated within pancreatic acinar cells. Local and sys-
temic tissue injury caused by released pancreatic enzymes and various inflammatory
mediators (e.g., kinins, free radicals, complement factors)
 Causes in dogs: Dietary fat appears to be primary cause. Pancreatic trauma (e.g..
iatrogenic at surgery, automobile associated), ischemia (e.g., due to shock), and
drugs (e.g., azathioprine) seem less common. Hypercalcemia is uncertain cause.
Causes of sterile pancreatic abscess uncertain, perhaps secondary to prior episodes
which caused necrosis of nearby fat.
■ Causes in cats: Infectious (e.g., toxoplasmosis, FIP), parasites (flukes), pancreatic
duct obstruction, and extension of feline hepatobiliary inflammation are believed
important.
Systems Affected
Gl—altered G1 motility (ileus) from sterile, chemical peritonitis; localgeneralized
sterile peritonitis due to enhanced vascular permeability.
 Hepatobiliaryshock, pancreatic enzyme injury, and inflammatory cellular infil-
trates may damage hepatocytes; intra/extrahepatic cholestasis possible.
Cardiovascular—cardiac arrhythmias secondary to myocardial depressant factor.
lation cascades; DIC may occur.
Respiratory—pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and ARDS are uncommon but
potentially fatal in patients with SIRS.
519
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Breeds at increased risk include miniature schnauzers, Yorkshire terriers, miniature
poodles and Siamese cats, but any animal may be affected. Female dogs may have
increased risk. Any age may be affected; middle aged to older dogs (i.e., >7 years)
and cats may be at increased risk.
 Concurrent diseases: In dogs, diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, and perhaps
chronic renal failure. In cats, hepatobiliary tract disease.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Acute Pancreatitis
Historic Findings
 Lethargy. depression, and anorexia are common in dogs and cats. Signs may be
 peracute or chronic (e.g., weeks). In dogs, vomiting and abdominal discomfort are
especially common; diarrhea and icterus are seen less frequently. In cats, history
tends to be much vaguer than in dogs. Vomiting is much less prominent than in
dogs.
Physical Examination Findings
  is  aa ani s p s 
■ Dogs: Upper abdominal discomfort is frequent but icterus less common; fever infre-
quent, severe pancreatitis secondary to pancreatic carcinoma may cause sterile sub-
cutaneous fat necrosis.
■ Cats: Often hypothermic; abdominal discomfort may be very hard to detect unless
very careful palpation is performed; icterus may occur.
Pancreatic Abscesses
Dogs
 Affected patients may have severe signs or may have chronic, mild, smoldering signs
of vague Gl upset (e.g., decreased appetite, intermittent vomiting).

DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
 Dogs and cats: mild, moderate, severe, or no change in the leukogram. Inflammatory
leukograms may be mature, regenerative, or degenerative; may/may not have toxic
leukocytes: pancreatitis cannot be differentiated from septic disease based on CBC.
 Thrombocytopenia may occur in patients with DIC.

be secondary to hepatocellular damage from direct damage (due to the proximity of
the pancreas to the liver) or SIRS.
Cats may be hypocalcemic (more obvious when measuring ionized calcium), but this
is inconsistent. Hypocalcemia in cats with pancreatitis is a negative prognostic
indicator.
Other Blood Tests
■ TLI is best test for EPl; however, finding EPI in dog breeds that are not known to
develop pancreatic acinar atrophy has been suggested to diagnose chronic pancre
atitis (currently uncertain). Very high serum TLI in dogs suggests acute pancreatitis
(can also be due to reduced glomerular filtration rate) but is a very insensitive test
for pancreatitis.
■]
 Pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity testing appears to be the most sensitive blood
test in both dog (approximately 80 percent) and cat, but specificity for clinically
significant inflammation is currently uncertain.
Imaging
Abdominal radiographs—Poorly sensitive in dogs and cats. Affected dogs may have
localized poor serosal contrast behind liver and in the upper right quadrant, static
gas pattern in the proximal duodenum, widened angle between pyloric antrum and
proximal duodenum. Valuable in helping eliminate diseases mimicking pancreatitis
(e.g., foreign body).
■Abdominal ultrasound—very specific, but sensitivity depends on the species (more
sensitive in dogs than cats) and operator. A hypoechoic pancreas surrounded by
hyperechoic shadows with or without fluid or an enlarged pancreatic parenchyma is
suggestive of pancreatitis. Extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction in the dog strongly
implies pancreatitis. Ultrasonographic appearance of the pancreas can change dra-
matically within hours. Cystic lesions suggest pancreatic abscess and should be
aspirated for cytology.
  Thoracic radiographs may reveal pleural effusion in cases with SIRS.
Pathologic Findings
■ Dogs: Adhesions and saponified fat are common; pancreas may appear edematous,
 discolored (i.e., gray, necrotic), or hemorrhagic. Chronic pancreatitis may have scar-
ring/fibrosis.
 Cats: Discolored with adhesions or may appear relatively normal. Nodular pancre-
atic hyperplasia may resemble pancreatitis. Cats are sometimes affected by lympho-
THERAPEUTICS

cats exist; therefore, current therapeutic recommendations are based on anecdotal

detect and replace ongoing losses.
Hypoalbuminemic patients may benefit from colloids (e.g., hetastarch at 5-20 ml/kg
per day).
■ Use of plasma is debatable; if used, ideally monitor serum albumin concentration or
antithrombin levels to determine when enough has been given.
■ Oral food intake is initially withheld because fat exacerbates canine pancreatitis.
Supply nutrients either enterally via enterostomy tube (e.g.. jejunostomy or naso-
jejunostomy tube) or parenterally (e.g.. peripheral parenteral nutrition). Use a fat-
 free diet (e.g. potato, rice) when oral food intake is restarted (e.g., no vomiting for
at least 36-48 hours)
PANCREATITIS523
Drug(s) of Choice
Antiemetics as needed: maropitant (l mg/kg SQ every 24 hours), ondansetron (0.5-
1 mg/kg IV every 12-24 hours), dolasetron (0.6-1 mg/kg IV every 24 hours). pro-
chlorperazine (0.1-0.5 mg/kg IM or SQ every 8-12 hours).
■ H, receptor antagonists for antidyspepsic action in nauseous patients: famotidine
(0.5 mg/kg IV every 12-24 hours)
■ Analgesics as needed: buprenorphine (0.005-0.0l mg/kg IM, IV, or SQ every 6-12
hours, hydromorphone 0.1 mg/kg SQ, IV, or IM every 6-8 hours, fentanyl 3-10μg/
kg per hour IV CRI).
Antibiotics: controversial because septic pancreatitis is extremely rare in dogs. If
deemed necessary: cefoxitin (30 mg/kg IV every 8 hours) or combination of ampicil-
lin (22 mg/kg every 8 hours) plus enrofloxacin (10mg/kg IV every 24 hours) is
reasonable.
 FFP if DlC is present: give sufficient amounts to restore antithrombin Ill to reference
range. Can give heparin concurrently (75-100 units unfractionated heparin SQ every
8 hours or 150 units low molecular weight heparin SQ every 8 hours) in animals
that are not thrombocytopenic or hypocoagulable.
 Steroids: very controversial, may be used in patients with SIRS. Relative hypoadre-
nocortism is suggested to occur in patients with severe inflammatory disease.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Enrofloxacin should be diluted and given over 30 min when given IV.
■Azathioprine rarely causes pancreatitis.
Surgical Considerations
■ Acute pancreatitis is not generally a surgical disease, and improper anesthesia may
decrease visceral perfusion, which theoretically may exacerbate pancreatitis
Pancreatic abscesses may be drained percutaneously or surgically. Dogs with extra
hepatic biliary tract obstruction rarely (if ever) need drainage or bypass or stent
procedures; appropriate medical management almost always resolves the obstruc
tion. Cholecystoduodenostomy should be avoided if possible because of associated
morbidity.
Cats
 Therapy in cats is similar to that of dogs with the following exceptions: (a) Feline
pancreatitis is not exacerbated by dietary fat; therefore, feed these patients as soon
as possible with naso-esophageal, esophagostomy, or gastrostomy feeding tubes.
■ In cats, septic pancreatitis occasionally occurs; antibiotics are more appropriate than
in dogs
■  In cats, steroids might be valuable with lymphocytic pancreatitis

BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Guarded prognosis—Condition can worsen quickly and unexpectedly. Dogs that
have pancreatitis once may be at increased risk for recurrence.
Patient Monitoring
■ Hydration status (frequently by physical examination and body weight), plasma
oncotic pressure (serum albumin concentration or COP as measured by a colloid
osmometer, if available), electrolyte concentrations (especially potassium), urine
output. Watch for SIRS or DIC
■ Clinical status is important in determining improvement during therapy; ultrasono-
 graphic appearance, TLI, and pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity currently are not
clearly effective ways to monitor response to therapy.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ In dogs: avoid high fat diets, especially if patient is at increased risk. Avoid unneces-

Paraphimosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Paraphimosis is the inability to retract the erect or nonerect extruded penis into the
preputial sheath. It must be differentiated from priapism, which is a state of continu-
ous erection usually due to neurologic abnormality (Figure 7l.l). Paraphimosis of
the erect penis is an emergency condition because constriction of venous blood
flow will lead to greater engorgement, necrosis, damage to urethra, and gangrene.
Chronic extrusion of the penis from the prepuce leads to drying, desiccation, licking.
and trauma.
 Figure 71.1 Paraphimosis in a young dog. This patient was treated with cool sugar solution placed on the
penis, lubrication of the penis with sterile lubricant, retraction of the edges of the prepuce to prevent the
preputial orifice from inverting during replacement of the penis, and a small incision in the preputial orifice that

528
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Causes include chronic licking, sexual excitement, balanoposthitis, entrapment of
penis outside prepuce during detumescense, neurologic disease (intervertebral disc
herniation, encephalitis), constriction of the penis due to scar tissue or foreign mate.
rial (e.g., malicious placement of string or rubber band), as well as anatomical issues
(os penis fracture) or muscular issues such as inefficiency of preputial
musculature.
■
Paraphimosis may be idiopathic.
■ Rarely paraphimosis may be congenital, due to an abnormally large preputial
opening, congenital preputial shortening, or paralysis of retractor penis muscle.
Systems Affected
■Renal/Urologic
■Reproductive
■Skin/Exocrine
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Dogs with paraphimosis of short duration may not have any signs other than the
dog's licking of an exteriorized penis. After some hours of exposure, ischemic necro-
sis and urethral obstruction can develop.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■Priapism
THERAPEUTICS
■ Paraphimosis requires immediate treatment. After 24 hours, the tissue damage and
urethral obstruction may require penile amputation. If urethral patency is in ques-
tion, place an indwelling urinary catheter. Replacement of the penis in normal posi-
tion is the goal.
■ Anesthesia may be necessary to perform the necessary manipulation to correct the
problem.
■ Cooled hyperosmotic agents such as dextrose 50%, concentrated sugar solution,
concentrated magnesium sulfate solution (Epsom salts), or concentrated saline solu-
tion are used to reduce edema and shrink the penis.
■ Cold packs may help reduce inflammation and swelling of the penis
PARAPHIMOSIS
529
 Penis should be cleaned prior to replacement.
 Lubricants such as K-Y jelly may aid in the return of the penis to the sheath.
■Hair rings or foreign materials should be removed.
■
 Surgical release of the paraphimotic ring may be required.
■
 An abdominal compression bandage and indwelling urinary catheter to maintain the
penis within the prepuce may also reduce localized edema.
Surgical Considerations
 Surgical release of the prepuce by making a small incision in the preputial orifice
may be required to replace the engorged penis back into the prepuce. The preputial
incision can be closed in two layers like any other laceration or incision.
■A purse-string suture around the preputial orifice may be considered to help prevent
recurrence of paraphimosis until the penile swelling resolves. Use care to avoid
overtightening of the purse-string suture, to allow normal urination and instillation
of antibiotic ointment into the prepuce.
 Severe cases that result in penile and urethral necrosis may require penile amputation
and prepubic urethrostomy.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Owners should be instructed to prevent dog from licking its penis and to avoid
activities that may result in excitement and penile erection.
■ Owners should be instructed to keep hair out of the preputial orifice to prevent hair
rings from occurring.

■ Pericardial effusion is a relatively common reason for dogs to present on an emer-
gency basis
Pericardial effusion is much more common in dogs than cats
Similar to fluid accumulations in other spaces in the body pericardial effusion occurs
due to one or a combination of the following factors:
 Increased vascular permeability (e.g., hemorrhage)
 Decreased capillary oncotic pressure (e.g., severe hypoalbuminemia)
■ Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (e.g., right-sided heart failure)
■Decreased lymphatic drainage (e.g., neoplasia)
 Common etiology of pericardial effusion

 Neoplasia
■Hemangiosarcoma
■ Heart base tumor
■Aortic body tumor (chemodectoma)
■  Ectopic malignant thyroid or parathyroid tissue
■ Mesothelioma

■ PPDH
■ Pericardial cyst
■Neoplasia
■Lymphoma
■ Metastatic neoplasia
■Infectious disease
■FIP
■ Hypoalbuminemia
■Pericardial effusion should be differentiated from cardiac tamponade.
■ Low volume pericardial effusion such as may occur with hypoalbuminemia or
various systemic inflammatory disorders may not cause any clinical signs.
  Cardiac tamponade refers to the condition in which pericardial effusion results in
progressively increasing intrapericardial pressure that impairs diastolic filling and
manifests with signs of cardiovascular compromise including both forward failure
(shock) and right-sided CHF Cardiac tamponade is more common in dogs than
cats.
Systems Affected
Cardiovascular
 Increased intrapericardial pressures result in decreased diastolic filling.
■
Decreased diastolic filling results in decreased stroke volume.
Decreased stroke volume results in decreased cardiac output.
■Decreased cardiac output results in decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues (shock).
Signs of right-sided CHF predominate.
 Cardiovascular manifestations of pericardial effusion are important to the diagnosis
of the condition based on physical examination.
Nervous
■ Decreased mentation (i.e., obtunded, stupor, or coma) may occur secondary to
hypotension and decreased oxygen delivery to the brain.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION
533
Gastrointestinal
Gastrointestinal manifestations of pericardial effusion are likely a result of decreased
gastrointestinal blood flow and may include vomiting or diarrhea.
Renal/Urologic
■ Decreased renal blood flow may result in prerenal azotemia
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 The underlying etiology of pericardial effusion may determine the patient population
most commonly affected.
■ Adult to geriatric golden retrievers and German shepherds commonly develop
pericardial effusion secondary to hemangiosarcoma involving the right atrium and
surrounding tissues.
■ Brachycephalic breeds and retriever breeds may have a higher incidence of heart
base tumors.
■ Young dogs may be more prone to developing pericardial effusion secondary to
anticoagulant rodenticide ingestion.
Risk Factors/Causes
 Rodenticide ingestion
 History of neoplasia, especially hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma, carcinoma, and meso-
thelioma at local or distant sites.

CLINICAL FEATURES
General
Pericardial effusion resulting in cardiac tamponade should be highly suspected based
on thorough physical examination.  Echocardiography  is critical to definitive
diagnosis.
Physical Examination
Cardiovascular System
■ Pale mucous membranes
■ Prolonged capillary refill time
■Tachycardia
■Poor pulse quality
■
Auscultation of the heart reveals decreased heart sounds. Lung auscultation is gener-
ally normal.
 Jugular venous distention (with or without pulsations) This finding helps differenti-
ate pericardial effusion from hemoperitoneum.
■ Compression of the cranial abdomen may exacerbate jugular venous distention
(with or without pulsation). This is termed the hepatojugular reflex.
■ Pulsus paradoxus is a normal phenomenon in which pulse quality varies with the
phase of the respiratory cycle. Pericardial effusion exacerbates pulsus paradoxus.
■ Arrhythmia may be noted while concurrently palpating the pulse and ausculting the
heart.
■  Abdominal distention results from right-sided CHF High intrapericardial pressures
result in high caudal caval pressures, which are transmitted to the hepatic venous
 system resulting in abdominal effusion.
Respiratory System
■ Increased respiratory rate and effort may occur.
■ Lung sounds are usually normal for the degree of respiratory effort. Lung sounds
may be decreased if concurrent pleural effusion is present.
Central Nervous System
■  Varying degrees of altered mentation may be noted due to a lack of oxygen delivery
to the brain. These may include obtundation, stupor, or coma.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Hypovolemia due to hemoperitoneum
■ Hypovolemia due to blood loss (into any potential space) may result in many
identical cardiovascular, respiratory, and CNS signs.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION
535
Differentiating findings
 In hypovolemia, the jugular vein is generally small or flat.
■Heart sounds are usually normal in hypovolemia although they may be quiet.
■ Pulsus paradoxus is not common in hypovolemia.
 Abdominocentesis will help rule out hemoperitoneum.
  CHF due to other cardiac diseases
■ Other cardiac disease causing CHF and cardiogenic shock may result in similar
cardiovascular signs of pericardial effusion.
 Right-sided disease
 Dilated cardiomyopathy (dogs and cats)
 Heartworm disease (caval syndrome)
■Tricuspid regurgitation
■ Congenital cardiac anomalies
Left-sided disease
■Dilated cardiomyopathy (dogs and cats)
■
 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (cats)
■Mitral regurgitation (dogs)
■ Congenital cardiac anomalies
■Differentiating findings
■Animals with CHF generally have very audible heart sounds.
■ Animals with CHF generally have heart murmurs or other auscultable abnor-
malities (gallop rhythm in cats)
■ Animals with CHF (especially dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs) often present
with evidence of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias.
■ Animals in left-sided CFH often have pulmonary edema with increased lung
sounds and more pronounced respiratory distress.
■ Echocardiography will definitively differentiate between CHF and pericardial
effusion.
DIAGNOSTICS
Hemostasis Assessment
Rodenticide intoxication is a cause of pericardial effusion.
■
 Hemostasis testing should be performed prior to pericardiocentesis
■
 Point-of-care coagulation analyzers are available to measure PT and aPTT.
■ ACT is an alternative to aPTT and may aid in the identification of severe intrinsic/
common cascade abnormalities without the need for a coagulation analyzer.
Blood smear can be rapidly performed to identify the presence of severe
thrombocytopenia.
Echocardiography/Ultrasound
 Point-of-care ultrasound capabilities are critical to the management of dogs and cats
in the emergency setting.

 Due to stretch of the pericardium over time, it should be noted that small volume
occurs acutely. Conversely, if accumulation occurs slowly, larger volume accul-
mulations may result in only mild clinical signs.
Electrocardiography
■ Electrocardiography provides a rapid diagnostic tool that will aid in the identification
of pericardial effusion.

amplitude complexes followed by lower amplitude complexes as the heart swings in the fluid within the peri-
cardial sac. Electrical alternans is not always seen in all cases of pericardial effusion
537
Arrhythmias
■ ST segment changes (elevation or depression)
Abdominocentesis
 Although not diagnostic for pericardial effusion, abdominal effusion that accumu-
 lates in patients with pericardial effusion is frequently a modified transudate in
character. Abdominocentesis can rule out hemoperitoneum, a condition that mimics
some of the clinical findings of patients with pericardial effusion.
Blood Gas Analysis
Athough not diagnostic for pericardial effusion, blood gas analysis may reveal meta-
bolic (lactic) acidosis associated with decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues due
to cardiogenic shock.
Thoracic Radiography
■ Thoracic radiography should be avoided if possible in favor of echocardiography and
 electrocardiography because it may require significant patient manipulation and
stress.
■ If necessary the patient should be stabilized prior to performing thoracic
radiography.
■Views
■ Dorsoventral
■Lateral
■Findings
■ Enlarged, globoid cardiac silhouette (Figure 72.4)
■  Acute pericardial effusion may demonstrate a normal cardiac silhouette.
■ Sharp border of the cardiac silhouette is due to its fixed location in contrast to
a moving pericardium/epicardium in a dog that does not have pericardial
effusion.
■ Enlargement of the caudal vena cava
■ Low volume pleural effusion may be present.
■ Note that the cardiac silhouette may appear normal in cases of acute tamponade,
when the pericardial sac has not had time to stretch. In such cases, the caudal
vena cava still appears large (Figure 72.5).
■Pulmonary changes
■ Pulmonary edema is uncommon in dogs with pericardial effusion.
■ Pulmonary edema is common in dogs and cats with left-sided CHF
■Pulmonary metastatic disease may be noted in dogs with hemangiosarcoma.
Pericardial Fluid Analysis
■Pericardial fluid is retrieved with pericardiocentesis.

 Figure 72.6 Evaluate the fluid carefully for clots because clots can form with inadvertent intracardiac
punctures.
■Assessment for clotting. Pericardial fluid that clots likely was retrieved from one
of the cardiac chambers, or can be associated with ongoing hemorrhage (Figure
72.6)
Cytologic analysis may aid in the identification of the underlying cause, especially
in bacterial and fungal pericarditis.
■ Some types of neoplasia may also exfoliate cells into the pericardial fluid.
■ Mesothelioma; interpretive caution should be exercised as reactive mesothe-
 lial cells have many characteristics of malignancy.
■Lymphoma
■Carcinoma
■Hemangiosarcoma and heart-base tumors are rarely diagnosed cytologically.
■ Aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal cultures should be performed if bacterial or fungal
etiology is suspected cytologically.
■ Acid-base analysis is not a useful predictor of the cause of pericardial
effusion.
Cross-Sectional Imaging
■ Only considered if traditional diagnostic testing is nondiagnostic and the patient has
been stabilized with pericardiocentesis
■ CT or MRl gated to the cardiac cycle may provide additional information as to the
underlying cause for the pericardial effusion, especially in cases of neoplasia

THERAPEUTICS
 The objective of treatment for dogs and cats with pericardial effusion is the establish-
ment or maintenance of hemodynamic stability.
 Dogs and cats with cardiac tamponade require emergent evacuation of their pericar-
dial effusion in order to achieve hemodynamic stability.
Although pericardiocentesis for diagnostic purposes may be indicated, patients with
low-volume pericardial effusion and few clinical signs may not warrant therapeutic
pericardiocentesis.
Pericardiocentesis
 Oxygen therapy maximizes oxygen saturation.
 Achieve peripheral intravenous access for the delivery of medications including seda-
tion if needed.
 There is little place for fluid therapy diuretics, or vasodilators in the acute manage-
ment of pericardial effusion.
 If, based on assessment of coagulation status, severe coagulopathy is considered a
likely cause of pericardial effusion, correcting coagulation abnormalities with FFP
(15-20 mL/kg) should be attempted prior to pericardiocentesis. FFP can be delivered
rapidly (<l hour) if necessary. However, if the pericardial effusion is associated with
lactic acidosis or thought to be immediately life threatening, pericardiocentesis
should be performed as plasma is being delivered.
■]
 ECG should be monitored throughout the procedure.
Pericardiocentesis
■ Light sedation should be considered to help alleviate stress and anxiety and to
decrease the likelihood of patient motion during pericardiocentesis.
■Midazolam 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV

■ Collect additional samples as indicated.
■ On occasion, the catheter will become occluded on the epicardium or inner
pericardium. Rotation of the catheter and repositioning may be effective.
 Create a 2- to 3-mm sidehole in the catheter approximately 7 to 10 mm from
its tip prior to pericardiocentesis to minimize the likelihood of this problem.
Caution should be taken not to destabilize the structural integrity of the
catheter by creating too large of a defect.

Additional Treatment Considerations

initiation of vitamin Kl therapy is indicated after FFP administration and
pericardiocentesis.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Pericardiocentesis is not without risk. Injury to the chest wall (i.e., intercostal vas-
cular injury), lung (i.e., pneumothorax), and heart (i.e., arrhythmias, chamber punc-
■Ventricular arrhythmias may be noted when the catheter contacts the epicardium. If
this occurs, the position of the catheter should be modified.
Diet
■ The patient should feel much better soon after pericardiocentesis. Feeding should
be considered after hemodynamic stability is achieved.
Activity
■Activity should only be restricted if ongoing bleeding is considered a significant pos-
sibility such as in animals with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication.
Surgical Considerations
■ There is a specific place for the surgical management of pericardial effusion in a
variety of conditions
Idiopathic pericardial effusion is generally initially managed through pericardio-
centesis. If the effusion reaccumulates, then open surgical or thoracoscopic
evaluation of the heart and thorax should be performed with subtotal pericardec.
biopsies should be acquired to rule out the possibility of neoplasia (especially
mesothelioma)
■Cardiac or pericardial neoplasia is initially managed through pericardiocentesis.
Tumors of the right atrial appendage can often be removed quite easily. There is
significant debate as to the value of subtotal pericardectomy or pericardial window
in dogs with masses of the heart. Pericardectomy in dogs with masses that have
not previously demonstrated severe, acute, or large volume hemorrhage is recom-
mended. Heart-base tumors (i.e., aortic body tumors) commonly behave this way.
Biopsies should be acquired for definitive diagnosis if possible. Hemorrhage from
biopsy sites may be severe.
■Bacterial or fungal pericarditis may occur due to hematogenous spread or direct
n o     d   
centesis should be performed to achieve initial stability. Pericardectomy and
establishment of ongoing pleural drainage with thoracostomy tubes coupled with
aggressive appropriate antimicrobial therapy are then indicated for definitive
treatment.
■ Surgical repair of left atrial rupture secondary to chronic mitral valve insufficiency
is possible.
 Pericardectomy plays a role in the management of restrictive pericarditis.
■ Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia is managed by replacing abdominal
contents back into the abdominal space and repairing the defect in the
diaphragm.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Client education will be specific to the underlying cause of pericardial effusion
Clients should monitor for recurrence of clinical signs which could signify reaccu
mulation of pericardial fluid.
Patient Monitoring
■ Pericardiocentesis is considered one of the most rewarding clinical procedures
because it results in very rapid improvement in clinical signs. Postprocedural moni-
toring may include any (or all) of the following:
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION 545
 Intermittent physical examination will allow the practitioner to monitor for abnor-
malities associated with pericardial effusion.
■ ECG will demonstrate heart rate and the presence of arrhythmias. If pericardial
effusion reaccumulates, the heart rate will rise.
 Intermittent point-of-care assessment for the recurrence of pericardial effusion
can be performed via ultrasound or echocardiogram.
 Central venous pressure will rise above the baseline measurements when pericar-
dial effusion accumulates.
Prevention/Avoidance
 If a predisposing condition such as anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication is diag-
nosed as the cause of pericardial effusion, eliminating the toxin from the environ-
ment is critical to preventing a second bout of intoxication.
Possible Complications
■ The most common long-term complication of pericardial effusion is recurrence.
Recurrence rates will be dependent on the underlying disease process and the treat-
ment rendered. For example, idiopathic pericardial effusion and pericardial effusion
secondary to neoplasia are likely to recur.
Expected course and Prognosis
As a general rule, pericardiocentesis results in immediate relief of symptoms of peri-
cardial effusion.
 Prognosis over time will be dependent on the underlying cause of the pericardial
effusion.
■ Neoplasia: Prognosis in dogs and cats with neoplasia is dependent on the type of
tumor and the treatment rendered. For example, dogs with hemangiosarcoma that
undergo surgical intervention for tumor resection and treatment with chemo.
 therapy have a median survival time of approximately 5 months. Dogs with aortic
body tumors treated with pericardectomy had median survival time of approxi-
mately 2 years in one series.
 Idiopathic: Dogs with idiopathic pericardial effusion generally respond favorably
to pericardiocentesis. If recurrence occurs, pericardectomy is recommended. A
good prognosis is generally given.
■ Cats: The most common cause of pericardial effusion in the cat is CHF Prognosis

Peritonitis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Peritonitis is an inflammatory process that results from contamination of the abdomi-
 nal cavity by either microorganisms or inflammatory chemicals.
 Peritonitis may be generalized and involve the entire abdominal cavity or localized
to a portion of the abdomen.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Primary  peritonitis occurs uncommonly  and is direct infection of  the
abdominal cavity through hematogenous spread. An example is feline infectious
peritonitis.
 Secondary peritonitis is more common and occurs secondary to bacterial or chemical
contamination of the abdomen. Examples are disruption of the abdominal cavity due
to a penetrating abdominal wound or rupture of a hollow viscus or abdominal
abscess.
■ Peritoneal injury leads to release of vasoactive substances and increased capillary
permeability Fluid, electrolytes, protein, and red blood cells are lost into the abdomi-
nal cavity and result in a decreased circulatory volume.
 White blood cells enter the abdominal cavity and begin to destroy bacteria. Proteases
 Sympathetic stimulation causes gastrointestinal stasis. leus and peritoneal stimula-
tion lead to vomiting that contributes to fluid losses.
 The decreased circulatory volume leads to hypovolemic shock. Absorption of bacte-
rial and tissue toxins causes septic shock that contributes further to hypotension and
tissue hypoxia.
 Eventually organ failure and death will result if left untreated.
Systems Affected
Cardiovascular
 Hypovolemia causes decreased cardiac output. Sympathetic nervous system activa-
tion causes increased cardiac contractility and vasoconstriction. Decreased tissue
547
perfusion results in myocardial ischemia. Myocardial ischemia and electrolyte imbal-
ances may trigger cardiac dysrhythmias that in turn further decrease cardiac output
Gastrointestinal
■ Sympathetic stimulation inhibits peristalsis. leus and peritoneal inflammation lead
to vomiting, which contributes to fluid losses.
Hemic/Lymphatic/lmmune
■Irritation of the peritoneal lining stimulates the inflammatory cascade. White blood
cells, red blood cells, proteins, electrolytes, and fluid enter the peritoneal space
White blood cells destroy bacteria and cause the release of proteases and endotoxins.
The coagulation cascade is activated.
Hepatobiliary
failure. Hypoglycemia may occur due to bacterial consumption of glucose, depleted
hepatic glycogen stores, and impaired gluconeogenesis.
Nervous
 Decreased blood pressure results in activation of the sympathetic nervous system.
Renal/Urologic
■ Decreased cardiac output and compensatory vasoconstriction can cause renal isch-
emia that may progress to renal failure.
Respiratory
■ Respiratory rate increases in response to tissue hypoxia.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Abdominal trauma, recent gastrointestinal surgery, source of infection within the
abdomen: gall bladder necrosis, hepatic abscess, prostatic abscess, pyometra, pancre-
atic abscess, gastrointestinal cbstruction, or perforation

DIAGNOSTICS
 Abdominocentesis: Diagnostic test most likely to provide rapid, definitive diagnosis
of peritonitis. May be performed with ultrasound guidance or using aseptic four
quadrant technique by aseptically inserting a 20-gauge needle or catheter into the
abdomen (patient standing or in lateral recumbency) (Figure 73.l). If fluid does not
flow through the needle spontaneously, gently aspirate using a 3-ml syringe.
With peritonitis the fluid is typically turbid or cloudy (Figure 73.2).
 Diagnostic peritoneal lavage: If abdominocentesis is negative but peritonitis is sus-
pected, infuse 22 ml/kg warm isotonic fluid into the abdominal cavity. Roll patient
from side to side and aspirate fluid with abdominocentesis for cytology.
 Abdominal fluid cytology: WBC greater than 10.000 cells/μl on abdominocentesis
fluid and greater than l,0o0 cells/μul on DPL fluid is indicative of peritonitis. Presence
of toxic neutrophils, plant material, and intracellular bacteria confirms peritonitis
         d 
■Abdominal fluid culture and sensitivity: May help to guide antibiotic therapy.

 Figure 73.1 Abdominocentesis and fluid cytology can provide a rapid, definitive diagnosis of peritonitis. A
20- or 22-gauge 1-inch needle is inserted into the abdomen and fluid is allowed to drip out of the open end
of the needle and is collected for analysis.

 Abdominal radiographs: Loss of abdominal detail indicates the presence of abdomi-
nal fluid but not the type of fluid. Free gas may be noted within the abdominal cavity
with rupture of hollow viscus or gas-forming bacteria. Generalized ileus may be
noted.
■ Contrast studies: Contraindicated with suspected gastrointestinal tract rupture as
barium and iodinated contrast materials can increase severity of peritonitis. Water
soluble iodinated contrast may be used to evaluate the integrity of the urinary tract.
■ CBC: Leukopenia or leukocytosis with left shift. Thrombocytopenia may be noted

■Chemistry panel: Renal values may be increased due to dehydration or renal failure.
Hepatic enzymes may be increased due to decreased hepatic perfusion and ischemia.

becomes decreased due to hepatic dysfunction and increased metabolic rate. Albumin
is decreased due to liver failure, malnutrition, fluid therapy, fluid sequestration in
the abdomen, and increased capillary permeability Electrolyte imbalances are
common.
■ Blood gases: Metabolic acidosis
■ Lactate levels: Increased due to tissue hypoxia
■
 Abdominal fluid lactate >2.0 mmol/liter greater than peripheral blood strongly suspi-
cious for septic peritonitis
■Abdominal fluid glucose less than 20 mg/dL compared with peripheral blood strongly
suspicious for septic peritonitis
 Figure 73.3 This patient has a generalized peritonitis secondary to a linear foreign body that has perforated
the intestine along the mesenteric border at multiple sites. Note the hemorrhagic appearance of the intestines
and the petechial hemorrhages throughout the mesentery
■ Note: Free gas may be present within the abdomen for up to 5 weeks following
abdominal surgery and increased white blood cells (as high as 10,000 cells/μl)
without bacteria can be noted on abdominocentesis for up to 3 days following
abdominal surgery so these factors should be considered in postoperative patients.
Pathologic Findings
■Free abdominal fluid which may contain plant material or bile
■  Inflammation of the peritoneal lining and serosal surface of the abdominal viscera
■
Omental and fibrin adhesions may be present (Figure 73.3).
■ Other pathology varies depending on the source of the contamination.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Supportive medical therapy
■ Intravenous fluid therapy with crystalloids and colloids. Colloids are an important
part of fluid therapy due to increased capillary permeability and tendency for protein
loss into the interstitial space.
■ Correct electrolyte imbalances
■ Dextrose supplementation as indicated by blood glucose
■ Broad-spectrum antibiotics

Copious lavage of the abdomen with warm, sterile saline (200-300 ml/kg)
■ All foreign material, necrotic tissue, and blood clots should be removed from the
abdomen at the time of exploratory surgery.
■ Placement of closed suction drain or open peritoneal drainage should be considered
to allow continued abdominal drainage (Figure 73.4).
Drug(s) of choice
■ Crystalloid fluids: Balanced electrolyte solution such as Normosol R, lactated

24 hours). An alternative is to use cefoxitin (30 mg/kg IV every 8 hours). Base con-
tinued antibiotic therapy on culture and sensitivity results.

Precautions/Interactions
■ Corticosteroids have been used to decrease inflammation and adhesion formation
and for positive cardiac effects; however corticosteroids can also increase potential
for gastrointestinal ulceration and cause immunosuppression so their use is
controversial.
  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications have also been advocated for their anti-
inflammatory effects but also increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and renal
toxicity so their use is not recommended
Diet
■ Due to ongoing protein losses and increased metabolic rate, these patients require
aggressive nutritional support.
■A jejunostomy or other feeding tube should be placed at surgery to allow for enteral
nutrition.
■ Parenteral nutrition can also be used to provide support but can be more complicated
 and does not help to maintain the intestinal mucosa.
Surgical Considerations
1 There has been a recent trend toward the use of closed suction drains in the treat-
ment of peritonitis rather than open abdominal drainage. One study showed similar
survival rates (70 percent) for patients treated with closed suction drainage compared
to a previous study which utilized either open abdominal drainage or primary closure
without any type of drainage system. Open abdominal drainage allows for rapid and
effective drainage of the abdomen, but there is higher potential for ascending infec-
tion and dehiscence and evisceration. Additionally it tends to be labor intensive and
is associated with greater fluid and protein losses and longer hospitalization. There
has been concern that closed abdominal drains would seal over with fibrin and
omentum and not provide effective drainage; however in the above mentioned study
all drains remained functional until they were removed. There is still risk for ascend-
ing infection with the use of closed suction drainage, and there is the potential for
the drain to be prematurely removed by the patient.
COMMENTS

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Differentiating Causes
 If there is historical or physical evidence of external trauma, hemothorax, chylotho-
rax, or diaphragmatic hernia should be considered.
Suspect underlying cardiac cause if murmurs, gallop rhythm, dysrhythmias with or
without jugular venous distension or pulsation are present.
■ Concurent ascites is suggestive of FIP CHF severe hypoalbuminemia, diaphrag-
matic hernia, metastatic neoplasia, coagulopathy, or pancreatitis
Cats with cranial mediastinal masses may have decreased compressibility of the
cranial thorax.
 Concurrent ocular changes such as chorioretinitis or uveitis can be found with FIP,
fungal disease, rickettsial disease, sepsis, or systemic neoplasia.

■  Polyclonal hyperglobulinemia is usually found in cats with FIP.
Other Laboratory Tests
■ If a coagulopathy is suspected (e.g., due to vitamin K antagonist rodenticide expo-
sure), check clotting times (e.g., PT) before performing thoracocentesis.
■Pleural fluid analysis, including physical characteristics (i.e., color, clarity, odor,
clots). pH, glucose, total protein, total nucleated cell count, and cytologic examina-
tion. See Table 74.1 for information on characterization of pleural fluid.
■ In cats, glucose concentration of pleural fluid with pyothorax and malignancy is
lower than serum glucose concentration. In most other cases, glucose concentration
in pleural fluid is usually equal to levels in serum.
■ Because mediastinal lymphosarcoma is often associated with FeLV infection, cats
with mediastinal masses should be tested for FeLV.
■ FIV test should be done to look for underlying immunosuppression in cats with
pyothorax.
■ Protein electrophoresis of serum or pleural fluid when FIP is suspected.
■ If cardiac disease is suspected, a heartworm test should be considered in dogs and
thyroid levels should be evaluated in cats to rule out heartworm disease and
hyperthyroidism.
■  If pyothorax is suspected, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture and sensitivity
should be done. Special stains (e.g. gram and acid-fast stains) of pleural fluid should
also be considered.
 If chylothorax is suspected, cholesterol and triglyceride levels of the fluid and serum
should be performed. An ether clearance test or Sudan stain of the pleural fluid can
also aid in the diagnosis of chylothorax.

PLEURAL EFFUSION563
■Post-thoracocentesis radiographs should be taken to evaluate for cardiomegaly, intra-
pulmonary lesions, mediastinal masses, diaphragmatic hernias, lung lobe torsions
and evidence of trauma.
■ Positive contrast peritoneography can be used to diagnose diaphragmatic
hernias.
 i a n  q   s aa 
Echocardiographic Findings
■ Ultrasonographic evaluation of thorax is recommended when cardiac disease, a dia-
phragmatic hernia, or a cranial mediastinal mass is suspected.
Diagnostic Procedures
■ Thoracocentesis-allows the collection of a sample of pleural effusion for fluid
analysis to help determine underlying cause
 Exploratory thoracotomy or thoracoscopy can be done to obtain biopsy samples of
the lung. lymph nodes, or pleura.
THERAPEUTICS
 Thoracocentesis should be done first in patients with respiratory distress.
■ If patient is stable after thoracocentesis, outpatient management is possible in some
cases.
■ Most patients require hospitalization for monitoring and repeat thoracocentesis as
needed.
■ For feline patients with pyothorax, indwelling chest tubes are necessary: in
dogs, most animals require surgical intervention for successful treatment of
pyothorax.
 Treatment for underlying disease is needed to prevent further fluid accumulation.
 Surgery is indicated for some neoplasias, diaphragmatic hernias, some cases of pyo-
thorax (e.g., for foreign body removal), lung lobe torsion (Figure 74.4), and some
cases of chylothorax.
■ For cases where fluid continues to accumulate despite treatment, repeated thoraco-
centeses or other palliative options such as placement of a subcutaneous vascular
access port connected to an intrathoracic drain should be considered.
Drug(s) of choice
Treatment varies with underlying cause.
 Diuretics should only be used for patients with diseases that cause fluid retention
and volume overload (e.g., CHF); otherwise, diuretics are largely ineffective for the
treatment of pleural effusion not associated with CHF

Pneumonia-Aspiration
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Aspiration pneumonia is caused by inhalation of liquid or particulate matter into the
lower respiratory tract that results in inflammation/infection of the pulmonary paren-
chyma. Aspiration pneumonia is far more common in the dog than the cat.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ In the oronasal pharynx, the close proximity of the upper airway to the proximal
aspect of the Gl tract make animals, especially dogs, susceptible to inhalation of
regurgitated and vomited materials, and subsequent aspiration pneumonia.
■ Aspiration pneumonia is commonly associated with vomiting, esophageal and laryn-
geal disorders, neurologic disease, and anesthesia.
Systems Affected
■Cardiovascular— Tachycardia possible to compensate for hypoxia.
■ Gl—May have a history of GI symptoms such as vomiting and regurgitation.
■ Hemic/Lymphatic/lmmune-May or may not have leukocytosis, left shift.
Musculoskeletal—May be weak secondary to hypoxia.
 Nervous-Likely depressed or obtunded due to hypoxia.
 Respiratory—Coughing, gagging, and tachypnea often present.
Skin/Exocrine--Fever is possible, if hypoxia is severe enough grey pale and cyanotic
mucus membranes can be present.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ A history of vomiting or regurgitation shortly followed by respiratory distress is
typical of aspiration into the lower airways. Additional common history includes
laryngeal or esophageal disorders and recent anesthesia. Older dogs and larger breeds
are reported to most commonly develop aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration may also
be a silent event, without a history of vomiting or regurgitation.
567
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Animals with megaesophagus and laryngeal dysfunction are at significant risk for
aspiration pneumonia. The aspiration event may not be observed in patients with
laryngeal and esophageal abnormalities, but in these patients an increased index of
suspicion is always present. Postoperative and heavily sedated patients often have an
impaired gag reflex making them susceptible to aspiration and subsequent
pneumonia.
■ In addition to anesthetized patients, those suffering from neuromuscular blockade
or paralysis (e.g., botulism, tick paralysis, coonhound paralysis) may develop an
impaired gag reflex and are also susceptible to the development of aspiration
pneumonia.
Animals that require mechanical ventilation also have an increased risk of aspiration
because oropharyngeal flora may be transported to the lower airways during intuba-
tion and result in airway colonization.
■ Nasogastric feeding tubes that have been misplaced or displaced can also predispose
to aspiration pneumonia.
Historical Findings
■ Commonly reported history includes recent vomiting or procedures requiring anes-
thesia. It is also important to quiz owners on subtle changes in their pet's attitude.
voice, appetite and for presence of a cough, which may be indicators of laryngeal
dysfunction as well as aspiration.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Increased respiratory rate and fever are present in only approximately one-third of
dogs that present with aspiration pneumonia, making them poor indicators of this
disease.
■ Abnormal lung sounds are commonly found during physical examination.
■Commonly described physical examination abnormalities are:
Auscultation
 Abnormal lungs sounds, most commonly crackles and loud lung sounds, have been
reported to be the most consistent physical examination finding in dogs with any
type of pneumonia. The lack of normal or abnormal sounds may be indicative of
complete consolidation of that area of lung. which is common in aspiration
Chest Percussion
■ Percussion of the thorax may be helpful in identifying areas of lung consolidation.
Percussion of consolidated areas of lung elicits a low pitched or dull sound.
PNEUMONIA—ASPIRATION
569
Tracheal Palpation
  Tracheal palpation can be utilized to elicit a cough and confirm epithelial irritation.
Pneumonia is most often associated with increased secretions and a moist, or produc-
tive cough.
Oral/Pharyngeal Examination
■ Information concerning laryngealpharyngeal anatomy and function is sought on
examination. The following abnormalities may be noted on close inspection and can
be associated with pneumonia: excess secretions, severe dental or tonsillar disease.
masses, an abnormal gag reflex, or the presence of foreign material or gastric
contents.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Dogs—Bacterial/fungal/viral pneumonia, near drowning, heartworm disease, pulmo-
nary thromboembolism, electrocution, smoke inhalation, congestive heart failure,
collapsing trachea, allergic airway disease, chronic bronchitis.
■ Cats—-Congestive heart failure, allergic airway disease (asthma), pyothorax.
DIAGNOSTICS
Thoracic Radiographs
 Key in diagnosing aspiration pneumonia.
■
 Three views (dorsoventral or ventrodorsal, right and left lateral) of the thorax are
recommended in order to examine all lung fields.
 Aspiration pneumonia is classically located in dependent lung lobes, right middle,
left cranial, and right cranial.
 Common radiographic findings include air bronchograms (Figures 75.1 and 75.2)
and alveolar infiltrates, from patchy to lobar consolidation.
Additional Base Line Testing
■ CBC, chemistry, and urinalysis, urine culture, fecal examination
■  Ancillary testing to rule out diseases that may increase susceptibility to aspiration
 a   s o    
Advanced Diagnostics
 Arterial blood gas can be utilized to objectively (A-a gradient) monitor disease pro-
gression/resolution, and response to therapeutics.

PNEUMONIA—ASPIRATION571
■  Pulse oximetry can also be used to monitor hypoxia and need for/response to oxygen
supplementation in a non-invasive manner.
■ BAL is considered the best method for obtaining samples from the deep lung but
should only be performed immediately after aspiration to alleviate airway obstruction
by foreign material or to obtain cultures when disease does not respond to standard
treatment.
■ Transtracheal wash is not recommended unless obtaining cultures, BAL preferred;
no visualization of lower airways.
■ Culture and sensitivity are recommended on samples obtained from airways; quan-
titative cultures are best to allow differentiation between normal flora and infection
Cultures consistent with infection contain >l.7 × l0' CFU
■Gram-stain samples are helpful if culture is negative.
THERAPEUTICS
Antibiotics
■ Pending culture and sensitivity results, bactericidal antibiotics with gram-negative
spectrum should be utilized when aspiration is suspected. Oral antibiotics may need
to be continued for extended periods of time (4 to 6 weeks after discharge). Antibiotic
therapy should be continued 1 to 2 weeks past resolution of radiographic and clinical
signs.
Fluid Therapy
 Iracheobronchial secretions are approximately 95 percent water; systemic dehydra-
tion results in increased secretion viscosity, retention in the lower airways. Decreasing
the viscosity of secretions will assist in their clearance and the resolution of
pneumonia.
Oxygen
■Animals with aspiration pneumonia can have lower PaO< 60 mm Hg, lower SaO < 90
to 92 percent, and significantly greater A-a gradients should be supplemented with
oxygen when hypoxia is documented.
Nebulization
■ Aerosol therapy has been utilized in pneumonic dogs in an attempt to decrease the
viscosity of infectious secretions and improve mucociliary clearance.
 Sterile saline is currently the only fluid recommended for use in patients being
nebulized.
 Ultrasonic nebulizers producing particles that range between 0.5 and 3.0μm in size
(mass median diameter) are necessary to ensure that fluid particles reach the lower
airways.
■ Nebulization is performed by placing the patient in a sealed cage for 30 to 45 minutes
three to four times daily.
■ Potential complications associated with cage nebulization include overhydration and
overheating in very small patients as well as bacterial contamination.
■ Nebulization of antibiotics, mucolytics, or other drugs are not routinely recom-
mended with the exception of Bordetella (Gentamycin 7 mg/kg)
Physiotherapy
■ Coupage is best described as physical therapy consisting of a firm clap (hands are
cupped) on the lateral aspects of the thoracic cage. The percussion of the thoracic
cage induces cough and serves to loosen and clear secretions. Coupage should be
performed for 5 to 10 minutes three to four times daily.
Diet
■ Malnutrition has been shown to alter pulmonary defense mechanisms, resulting in
impaired clearance of organisms and foreign material. Once GI symptoms have been
addressed enteral nutrition should be attempted. In severe cases, parenteral nutrition
may be necessary.
Activity
■Activity within the limits of the animal's pulmonary function should be encouraged.
as it helps mobilize pulmonary secretions.
Surgical Considerations
■ Lung lobectomy has been reported as a treatment for pneumonia, of various etiolo-
gies, that is nonresponsive to medical therapy. Lung lobectomy should be considered
in chronic cases of aspiration pneumonia when a foreign body is suspected, or pneu-
monia is chronic or reoccurring.
COMMENTS
  Radiographic changes can lag behind clinical changes up to 48 hours; the most reli-
able, objective way to gauge clinical changes are with arterial blood gases. Hypoxic
 animals not responding to oxygen therapy alone could require ventilatory support.
Client Education
Monitor for return of respiratory difficulty, anorexia, vomiting, and fever.
Patient Monitoring
■ The A-a gradient is the most objective way to monitor disease progression. Unless
there is an acute change in the animal's condition, it is calculated once daily.
■ Radiographs are usually repeated at two week intervals once the animal is
discharged.
PNEUMONIA—ASPIRATION
573
Prevention/Avoidance
■If associated with anesthesia make sure endotracheal tube cuffs are functioning
properly.
Possible Complications
 Pneumonia may not resolve with medical management, especially if a foreign body
is present, and surgical options may need to be considered.
Expected Course and Prognosis
Aspiration pneumonia without a permanent underlying cause such as megaesopha
gus is likely to resolve when treated appropriately; clinical improvement is often
dysfunction are always susceptible to aspiration and many do not resolve. Greater
than 75 percent of patients suffering from aspiration pneumonia are reported to
survive.

Pneumonia-Bacterial
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■  Defined as any inflammation of the lung parenchyma that results in the filling of the
alveolar air spaces with exudate. Bacterial colonization of the lung is the most
common cause most of pneumonia in small animals. Bacterial pneumonia occurs
more commonly in dogs than in cats.
ETOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Animals that develop bacterial pneumonia often have impaired pulmonary defenses
Inhibition of pulmonary immunity is often caused by underlying metabolic diseases
(such as diabetes mellitus and hyperadrenocorticism), lower airway disease (chronic
bronchitis, ciliary dyskinesis), laryngeal and esophageal dysfunction, as well as those
from exposure to environmental pathogens (Bordetella). Additionally pathogenic
bacteria may have specific physical and biochemical properties that allow them to
thwart lower airway defenses and cause disease. The source of invading bacteria is
often from the oronasal and pharyngeal regions, upper Gl tract, and normal lower
airway flora. Hematogenous spread has also been proposed as a cause of bacterial
pneumonia and is reported to occur more commonly in cats.
Systems Affected
■Cardiovascular——Tachycardia possible to compensate for hypoxia
■ Hemic/Lymphatic/lmmune—May or may not have leukocytosis with a left shift
Musculoskeletal—May be weak secondary to hypoxia
 Nervous—Likely depressed or obtunded due to hypoxia
 Respiratory—Coughing, gagging, and tachypnea with or without expectoration of
debris or mucus often present
 Skin/Exocrine--Fever is possible, if hypoxia is severe enough grey pale and cyanotic
mucous membranes can be present.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 No sex or breed predispositions
575
Risk Factors/Causes
■Metabolic disorders—diabetes mellitus or hyperadrenocorticism
Acquired diseases—myasthenia gravis, polyradiculoneuritis, or tick paralysis
Immunosuppression—secondary to chemotherapy or other infections (i.e., viral,
fungal)
■  Laryngeal and esophageal disorders—laryngeal paralysis or megaesophagus
■ Other sites of infection—dermatologic, phlebitis, oral, urinary tract, or reproductive
tract
■ Exposure to other pets—shelters, boarding grooming, shows, or dog parks
■Vomiting
Historical Findings
■Coughing, nasal discharge, tachypnea, orthopnea, anorexia, dehydration, or weight
loss
0
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ No single clinical parameter is pathognomonic in the diagnosis of bacterial
 pneumonia.
Dogs
■ Fever reported in <50 percent of dogs with bacterial pneumonia; cough, tachypnea
nasal discharge.
 Auscultation of all lung fields is an important part of the diagnosis of pneumonia
Common abnormalities detected during auscultation commonly include crackles and
loud lung sounds. Decreased sounds may be indicative of complete consolidation of
that area of lung, which is common when aspiration is an underlying cause of bacte-
rial pneumonia.
■ Tracheal palpation can be utilized to elicit a cough and confirm tracheal irritation.
■I
Pneumonia is most often associated with increased secretions and a moist, or produc-
tive cough.
■ Oropharyngeal examination can also provide information with regard to bacterial
pneumonia. Laryngeal and pharyngeal anatomy and function can be assessed, as well
as the condition of the dentition and gums. Additional oropharyngeal abnormalities
that may be noted and can be associated with pneumonia include: excess secretions
tonsillar disease, masses, an abnormal gag reflex, or the presence of foreign material
or gastric contents.
Cats
■May have clinical signs similar to dogs or none at all.
■ Observe for oral erosions and ocular signs consistent with URI, which may be an
underlying or associated disease.
PNEUMONIA—BACTERIAL
577
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Dogs—Bacterialfungal/viral pneumonia, near drowning, heartworm disease, pulmo-
nary thromboembolism, electrocution, smoke inhalation, congestive heart failure,
collapsing trachea, allergic airway disease, or chronic bronchitis.
 Cats—Congestive heart failure, allergic airway disease (asthma), or pyothorax.

Ventrodorsal or dorsoventral, and both left and right lateral views are recommended
to examine all lung fields.
 Common radiographic findings include air bronchograms and alveolar infltrates.

may be present in severe cases.

 gression/resolution, and response to therapeutics.
■ Pulse oximetry can also be used to monitor hypoxia and need for/response to oxygen
supplementation in a non-invasive manner.
■ BAL is considered the best method for obtaining culture and cytology samples from
small airways, alveoli and pulmonary interstitium.
■ Transtracheal wash does not provide visualization of the airways; samples collected
are from larger airways.
■ Culture and sensitivity are recommended on samples obtained from airways; quan-
titative cultures are best because they allow differentiation between normal flora and
infection. Cultures consistent with infection contain >l.7 x l0? CFU.
■ Gram-stain samples are helpful if culture is negative.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Treatment objective are to improve oxygenation and eliminate the infection.
Concurrent treatment of underlying and secondary diseases may be necessary.
Antibiotics
1 Pending culture and sensitivity results, bactericidal antibiotics with a broad-spectrum
of activity should be utilized. Severe case should be started on intravenous antibiotics
to provide good penetration of the pulmonary parenchyma. Maximum doses and
dosing intervals should be utilized to ensure effectiveness. Mild cases can be started
on oral antibiotics. Drug classes commonly effective in treating bacterial pneumonia
include cephalosporins, potentiated penicillins, and fluoroquinolones. Oral antibiot-
ics may need to be continued for extended periods of time (4 to 6 weeks after dis

radiographic and clinical signs.
Fluid Therapy
■  Tracheobronchial secretions are approximately 95 percent water; systemic dehydra-
tion results in increased secretion viscosity retention in the lower airways, and
often ventilation perfusion abnormalities. Fluids should be administered to
correct dehydration and maintain hydration status until animal can sustain
itself.
PNEUMONIA—BACTERIAL579
Oxygen
Animals with pneumonia can have lower PaO < 60 mm Hg), lower SaO < 90 to 92
percent, and significantly greater A-a gradients and should be supplemented with
oxygen when hypoxia is documented.
Nebulization
 Aerosol therapy has been utilized in pneumonic dogs in an attempt to decrease the
viscosity of infectious secretions and improve mucociliary clearance.
■ Sterile saline is currently the only fluid recommended for use in patients being
nebulized.
■ Ultrasonic nebulizers that produce particles that range between 0.5 and 3.0pm in
size (mass median diameter) are necessary to ensure that fluid particles reach the
lower airways.
■Nebulization is performed by placing the patient in a sealed cage for 30 to 45 minutes
up to three to four times daily.
 Potential complications associated with cage nebulization include overhydration and
overheating in very small patients as well as bacterial contamination.
■ Nebulization of antibiotics, mucolytics, or other drugs are not routinely recom-
mended with the exception of Bordetella. Cases of Bordetella that are resistant to
systemic antibiotics may respond to the local effects of those that are nebulized
(Gentamycin 7 mg/kg diluted with sterile saline).
Physiotherapy
■ Coupage is best described as physical therapy consisting of a firm clap (hands are
cupped) on the lateral aspects of the thoracic cage. The percussion of the thoracic
cage serves to loosen and help clear secretions by inducing coughing. Coupage
should be performed for 5 to l0 minutes three to four times daily
Diet
■ Malnutrition has been shown to alter pulmonary defense mechanisms and result in
impaired clearance of organisms and foreign material. Once Gl symptoms have been
addressed enteral nutrition should be attempted.
■ In severe cases, the use of parenteral nutrition may be required.
Activity
■ Activity within the limits of the animal's pulmonary function should be encouraged
because it helps mobilize pulmonary secretions.
Surgical Considerations
■ Lung lobectomy has been reported as a treatment for pneumonia, of various
etiologies, that is nonresponsive to medical therapy Lung lobectomy should be
considered in chronic cases of lobar pneumonia when an aspirated foreign body is
suspected as the underlying cause.
COMMENTS
 Radiographic changes can lag behind clinical changes up to 48 hours; the most reli-
able, objective way to gauge clinical changes is to obtain arterial blood gasses.
Hypoxic animals not responding to oxygen therapy alone could require ventilatory
support.
Client Education
 Monitor for return of respiratory difficulty, anorexia, vomiting, and fever.
Patient Monitoring
A-a Gradient
■ The A-a gradient is the most objective way to monitor disease progression. Unless
there is an acute change in the animal's condition, it is recommended that the A-a
gradient be calculated once daily.
■ To calculate the A-a gradient, obtain an arterial blood sample. The values of sig-
nificance on the arterial blood sample include the PaO, barometric pressure, and
the PaCO2.
■ “Big A" (A) is the amount of oxygen available in the alveolus and is dependent
 on the FiOz (on room air, the FiO is 21 pecent or 0.2l), the barometric pressure
(think of this as the force that can help push the air into the lungs), and the dif-
fusion capacity of air itself. Because CO diffuses more readily than oxygen, there
is a calculation that takes into consideration the CO, component.
■ “Little a" or (a) is the amount of oxygen actually in the bloodstream.
■To calculate the A-a gradient, first calculate A.
■ A = FiO (barometric pressure - water vapor pressure) - PaCO/0.8
■ Water vapor pressure is a constant and is equal to 47.
 Next, subtract PaO, from A, and the value is equal to the A-a gradient.
 The A-a gradient allows you to determine the degree of diffusion impairment
between the amount of oxygen available to the lung, and that which actually enters
the bloodstream
 Normal values are < 10, 10 to 15 suggest moderate diffusion impairment, and >20
is suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
PaO,/FiO, Ratio
 In an animal that is receiving supplemental oxygen, the A-a gradient will be negative.
Instead, one must calculate the PaO/FiO ratio.
PNEUMONIA—BACTERIAL581
FiO can be estimated at 40 percent or 0.40. Ideally, measure the FiO2 with an oxygen
meter.
■ Normal calculated PaO/FiO values are > 400. Values in between 200 and 300 are
suggestive of acute lung injury. Values < 200 are suggestive of acute respiratory
distress syndrome.
Radiographs
■ Radiographs are usually as needed while the patient is in the hospital and repeated
at 2-week intervals once the animal is discharged.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Pet should be vaccinated for any infectious diseases that can predispose to bacterial
 pneumonia. Underlying diseases and conditions such as dental abscesses, diabetes,
and hyperadrenocorticism should be addressed.
Possible Complications
■
 Severe pneumonia can result in pulmonary abscesses, pneumothorax and chronic
airway issues; surgery and long-term/ongoing therapy may be required.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ A good prognosis can be given to those patients that show improvement of
   o   o t   
therapy.
 Poor outcomes on the other hand can be predicted in those animals that have anti-
biotic resistant organisms cultured, underlying diseases that can not be resolved (e.g.:
laryngeal paralysis, megaesophagus), the presence of concurrent disease (e.g., fungal
and viral infections, neoplasia), and hypercarbia on presentation.

Pneumothorax
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Free air that accumulates in the pleural cavity in between the lungs and the pleura
Can be spontaneous (rate) or more commonly caused by trauma.
Spontaneous pneumothorax causes air to accumulate in the pleural space outside of
the lungs without trauma.
Traumatic pneumothorax is air that accumulates in the pleural spaces as a result of
trauma to the trachea, mainstem bronchi, lungs, or thoracic wall.
 Pneumothorax can also be categorized as being closed or open.
■ Closed pneumothorax occurs when there is no break in the integrity of the thoracic
wall.
 Open pneumothorax is associated with a break in the integrity of the thoracic wall,
such that atmospheric pressure comes in contact with intrapleural pressure, and
causes the lungs to collapse.
 A tension pneumothorax results when damage to the bronchi or lungs causes a flap
of tissue that acts as a valve. When the animal inhales, air leaks from the flap into
the pleural space. Upon exhalation, the flap of tissue closes and prevents the air from
leaving the pleural space. Pleural pressure continues to accumulate until there is
severe pressure on the cranial vena cava that prevents blood from returning to the
right-sided heart, thus impairing cardiac preload. As a result, cardiac output and
blood pressure are adversely compromised. The animal with a tension pneumothorax
can rapidly deteriorate and die without immediate aggressive intervention.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ The pleural cavity is lined with a thin layer of fluid and tissue called the parietal and
visceral pleura. Normally, the visceral and parietal pleura and the lungs are contigu-
ous, and freely move the lungs against the thoracic wall and diaphragm during
normal respiration.
 Pressure in the pleural space is normally subatmospheric. An animal actively draws
in a breath to expand the lungs, and then relaxation of the thoracic wall and dia-
phragm allows air within the lungs to leave the alveoli and return to the atmosphere
via the trachea and upper airways. When air escapes from the lungs into the pleural
583
space,it accumulates in between the parietal and visceral pleura, and causes the lungs
to collapse.

ticipate in alveolar gas exchange, or ventilation. This results in a ventilation-
perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia.
■ A pneumothorax can be bilateral if the mediastinum is open, or unilateral, if the
mediastinum on both sides of the thorax does not communicate.
Systems Affected
■Cardiovascular
■Respiratory
Incidence/Prevalence
■ Unknown
■ It has been documented in more than 40 percent of cases of thoracic trauma, and
10 to 20 percent of cases of trauma caused by contact with automobiles.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Species
 Dogs and cats
Breed Predilection
■ Spontaneous pneumothorax is documented more commonly in large, deep-chested
breeds of dog.
Historical Findings
■ In cases of traumatic pneumothorax, recent trauma may be documented, either fall
from height, motor vehicle accident, encounter with a large animal, or recent anes-
thesia with endotracheal intubation. latrogenic pneumothorax also can be caused by
jugular venipuncture (although rare) or thoracocentesis.
■  In spontaneous pneumothorax, historically there may be an acute onset of cough.

 Figure 77.1 Open pneumothorax caused by severe thoracic bite wounds. Notice the lung visible outside of
the thoracic cavity.
■ When pneumothorax has been caused by a traumatic event, other signs referable to
trauma may be present, including obvious hemorrhage or abrasions, rib fractures or
other injuries to the thoracic wall, paradoxical chest wall motion in cases of flail
chest, abrasions, frayed toenails, bite wounds, tachycardia, hypotension.
 In cases of open pneumothorax, bite wounds or penetrating injuries to the thoracic
wall may be visible (Figure 77.1). If recent anesthesia and endotracheal intubation
caused the pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema may be present.
Risk Factors/Causes
injuries, thoracocentesis, perforation of the esophagus from esophageal foreign
bodies, migrating foreign bodies (grass awns, porcupine quills), neoplasia, pulmo-
nary abscesses, parasitic infections (paragonimus), cysts (congenital), pulmonary
bullae,emphysema
 Trauma, particularly in animals allowed to roam near open roads or near large
animals; recent thoracocentesis, respiratory pathology, grass awns, encounters with
porcupines, iatrogenic with overinflation of endotracheal tube cuff

Differentiating Causes
  Pneumothorax can be differentiated from other caused of pleural space disease and
restrictive respiratory pattern by a lateral (Figure 77.2) and dorsoventral thoracic
radiograph (Figure 77.3).
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
■ CBC, biochemistry, and urinalysis are usually unrewarding unless there is an infec-
tious etiology that is associated with pulmonary pathology and sometimes a neutro-
philic leukocytosis.
Other Laboratory Tests
          
may be present.
■Hypoxemia and SpO < 90 percent with pulse oximetry.
Diagnostic Procedures
Imaging
■ Thoracic radiographs should be delayed until the patient is more stable, and attempts
have been made to treat the pneumothorax prior to making a definitive diagnosis
therapeutic in cases of pneumothorax.
 Thoracic radiographs may reveal free air within the pleural space, as evidenced by
retraction of the lungs away from the thoracic wall, and elevation of the cardiac
silhouette from the sternum on a lateral view. The pulmonary vasculature will not
be visible at the level of the thoracic wall. In cases of pneumomediastinum, the
cranial vena cava, esophagus, and aorta will be visible. Rib fractures, foreign bodies.
such as bullets, may be visible in cases of traumatic pneumothorax. If such findings
are not present, often thoracic radiographs should be repeated after therapeutic tho-
racocentesis, to evaluate the lung for parenchymal disease such as bullae.
■CT scanning: May be sensitive for identifying both pneumothorax, as well as paren-
chymal pathology. A disadvantage of CT is the frequent need for heavy sedation or
anesthesia in veterinary patients.
THERAPEUTICS
 Treatment of pneumothorax largely depends on the degree of hypoxia and respira-
tory difficulty, severity of lung collapse, response to therapy, and whether the pneu-
mothorax recurs.
588
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■  Initially, supplemental oxygen should be administered as rapidly as possible and with
the least stressful method available.
Thoracocentesis
■ Therapeutic thoracocentesis should be performed. To perform thoracocentesis.
clip a square in the middle of the lateral thoracic wall, envisioning the ribcage as a
box. Clip a box in the middle of the box, then aseptically scrub the area. Next,
connect a hypodermic needle (usually 22-gauge three-quarter- to one-and-one-
half-inch needle, depending on the size and degree of obesity of the patient) to a
length of intravenous extension tubing. to a three-way stopcock, to a 35- to 60-ml
syringe. With the bevel of the needle facing down, insert the needle perpendicular
to the thorax, in the middle of the box, in between rib spaces (Figure 77.4). Once
the needle has entered the pleural space, direct the needle so that it sits parallel
with the thoracic wall. The bevel of the needle is now facing the inside of the pleural
 space and ready to aspirate air. The needle can be swept around like the hands of a
clock, always parallel with the thoracic wall, to avoid iatrogenic puncture of the
lungs. In smaller patients, such as neonates, a butterfly catheter and smaller needle
can be lised.
■ As a rule of thumb, always perform bilateral thoracocentesis, in the event that the
mediastinum does not communicate. If you cannot obtain negative pressure and fully
evacuate the air from the pleural space, or if the air reaccumulates more than once
a thoracostomy tube should be placed
 Figure 77.4 Inserting a 22-gauge hypodermic needle into the pleural space for thoracocentesis
PNEUMOTHORAX
589
Thoracostomy Tube Placement
 In the event that a thoracostomy tube needs to be placed, clip the entire lateral thorax
from the level of the vertebrae to the sternum, and from the lst through l3th ribs
Aseptically scrub the clipped area, and then drape the area with sterile field towels.
Ideally, the animal should be anesthetized and intubated, so that you can maintain
an airway and breathe for the patient, if necessary. Have an assistant pull the skin
on the lateral thoracic wall cranially and ventrally, toward the elbow. This will facili-
tate making a tunnel through which the tube is placed. Trocarized thoracic drainage
catheters are manufactured from a variety of manufacturers. Any thoracic drainage
tube should be, at minimum, the size of a mainstem bronchus, and not smaller, such
that if a mainstem bronchus is the location of air leakage, suctioning the thorax
through the tube can keep up with the air that is accumulating in the pleural space.
Make a nick incision at the dorsal aspect of the 12th rib, then tunnel the tube under
the skin, so that the tube can enter the 8th to l0th intercostal space. The trocarized
thoracic catheters will need to be pulled so that the catheter is perpendicular with
the thoracic wall (Figure 77.5). Grasp the base of the tube at the point of entry into
the thorax, and push the tube into the thorax, in between rib spaces. Take care to
avoid pushing the tube and trocar in too far, to avoid iatrogenic puncture of lung.
heart or large vessels. An alternative to trocarized thoracic drain placement is to place
a red rubber catheter. To place a red rubber catheter, make a small nick incision in
the skin, then gently dissect through the subcutaneous tissues and intercostal muscles
with the tips of a hemostat or Metzenbaum scissors. Once the pleural space is visible

 Figure 77.6 Sterile lubricant around an open sucking chest wound
grasp the tip of the red rubber catheter and push it into the thorax in between the
8th to l0th intercostal space. Push the catheter cranially to the level of the 5th inter-
costal space. To make the tube more rigid during this process, insert a rigid poly-
propylene urinary catheter through the red rubber catheter. The polypropylene
catheter can be removed, and then the tip of the tube connected to a Christmas tree
adapter, length of intravenous extension tubing, three-way stopcock, and a syringe
or continuous suction apparatus. The tube can then be secured with a combination
of horizontal mattress and finger-trap sutures. The tube should be covered with a
sterile wrap, and checked daily for signs of erythema and infection.
Open sucking chest wounds: If an animal has an open sucking chest wound, clip the
wound, and place sterile lubricant or antibacterial gel around the wound (Figure
77.6). Next, place a sterile surgical glove over the wound (Figure 77.7). The combi-
nation creates a seal from the atmosphere and the pleural space. The pleural space
can now be evacuated using a combination of thoracocentesis and thoracostomy tube
placement.
Heimlich valves are one-way valves that allow air to escape from the thoracic cavity
during inhalation. Heimlich valves can be useful in patients greater than 20 kilo.
grams, who have enough strength to open the valve. The Heimlich valves are not
useful in smaller patients. Also, the apparatus can often become clogged with fibrin
and not work properly. For this reason, their use is not recommended.
■ Analgesia can be provided as systemic analgesia with opioids, as well as thoracic
analgesia using l mg/kg lidocaine, and 1 mg/kg bupivacaine through the chest tube
every 8 hours

■ Tension pneumothorax may require creating a rapid hole in the thoracic wall and

and the tension pneumothorax is under control.
■ Traumatic pneumothorax rarely requires surgical intervention.
 Spontaneous pneumothorax often requires surgical removal of the diseased lung. In
the cases of bullae or blebs, however, rarely are the lesions isolated to one area, and
recurrence is common. For this reason, surgical intervention should not be per-
 formed without a preoperative CT scan to determine the extent of pulmonary paren-
chymal involvement.
Activity
■ Restrict activity to short walks, only on a leash, for as long as the chest tube is
required, and at minimum, at least l week after tube removal, to allow healing of
pulmonary lesions.
Surgical Considerations
■ When performing anesthesia on any patient with traumatic pneumothorax or pul-
monary contusions, use care to avoid overexpansion of the lungs to more than 20 cm
HO, to avoid barotrauma and iatrogenic pneumothorax. Carefully inflate the cuff
on endotracheal tubes, particularly in feline patients. When an animal needs to be
rotated while under anesthesia, take care to disconnect the endotracheal tube from
the anesthetic circuit when turning the patient, to avoid twisting and placing torque
on the endotracheal tube and trachea, and causing an iatrogenic tear.
■ Thoracoscopy may allow visualization of blebs and bullae in cases of spontaneous
pneumothorax.
■ Bronchoscopy rarely identifies the location of the tracheal tear because it is often
dorsal under the trachealis membrane.
■  Lung lobectomy may be required to remove lesions that are leaking air.
Nursing Care
■ Oxygen therapy 50 to 150 ml/kg per minute of humidified oxygen
■Analgesia
■ Maintenance of the thoracic drainage tube to ensure that all connections are tightly
sealed and not allowing air to enter the thorax. Check the tube manually several
 times a day that it is maintaining negative pressure if it is attached to a continuous
suction device. Check the entrance site at least once daily for signs of infection.
■ Keep an Elizabethan collar on at all times to prevent the patient from licking at the
tube or removing the tube.
COMMENTS
Patient Monitoring
■ Careful monitoring of respiratory rate and effort, thoracic auscultation, and arterial
blood gases or pulse oximetry to evaluate the patient's response to therapy.
■ Rapid, shallow, restrictive respiratory pattern should signal the recurrence of
pneumothorax
■  Thoracic radiographs can be performed to evaluate for the recurrence or resorption
of free air.

of air aspirated. If an animal is attached to a closed collection system, monitor the
bubbles in the water trap that are visible as air is sucked into it.
Prevention/Avoidance
 Do not allow animals to free roam or have access to large animals that can cause
bodily harm.
Possible Complications
■ Possible complications range from (most serious) death due to cardiovascular
and respiratory collapse in the most severe cases. to iatrogenic lung laceration
during thoracocentesis or thoracostomy tube placement. Infection, lung laceration,
liver or diaphragm laceration, and reexpansion pulmonary edema can also poten-
tially occur.
PNEUMOTHORAX
593
Expected Course and Prognosis
 The prognosis for traumatic pneumothorax is generally good and largely depends on
the extent of other concurrent injuries. With simultaneous injuries such as internal
hemorrhage. pulmonary contusions, and cardiovascular collapse, prognosis worsens.
With spontaneous pneumothorax, the prognosis is more guarded, unless the location
of the air leak is isolated to a small area of lung. With multifocal or generalized
pulmonary parenchymal disease, prognosis becomes more and more guarded for
long-term recovery.

Potassium Disorders-
Hyperkalemia
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Hyperkalemia is a serum electrolyte disorder that occurs when serum potassium
concentrations exceed 5.5mEq/L. The increased serum potassium level causes a
depolarized state at the muscular cell membrane and causes skeletal and cardiac
muscle dysfunction.

bolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, massive tissue injury, drugs such as trimethoprim-
sulfa and ACE-inhibitors, insulin deficiency (ie., diabetes mellitus/diabetic
ketoacidosis), hypertonicity, and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis
■ latrogenic excess potassium administration in improperly mixed parenteral fluids
after addition of potassium, failure to close the infusion port to the patient when
potassium is added to the fluids, too rapid intravenous administration of potassium
containing fluids, too rapid injection of potassium penicillin

nocortical atrophy with a varying degree of fibrous tissue, lymphocytes, and plasme
cell infiltrates. Rarely other pathology from other diseases can occur.
■ Renal disease—varying types of renal pathology and histopathology depending on
the cause.
THERAPEUTICS
■ TIreat underlying disease, lower serum potassium level.
Drug(s) of Choice
maintenance.
■ Prednisolone 5 to 10 mg/kg IV to provide glucocorticoid replacement in acute crisis.
■ Desoxycorticosterone pivalate 2 mg/kg IM every 2l to 28 days to replace mineralo-
corticoid can be given SQ subsequently.
■ Abnormal cardiac function calls for additional treatment measures:
Calcium gluconate 10%, 1 ml/kg IV, will counter cardiomyotoxicity.
■  Insulin—glucose—give regular insulin at one-fourth to one-half unit per kg with
2 grams of dextrose for each unit of insulin given. This will move potassium ions
from the extracellular into the intracellular space.
■ For renal disease, treatment consists of intravenous fluids and the same emergency
measures (except for the steroids) mentioned previously for treating hyperkalemia
associated cardiac abnormalities.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Calcium gluconate and sodium bicarbonate should be administered in separate
syringes to avoid precipitation which occurs when they are mixed.
Diet
■ Diet usually unaffected with hypoadrenocorticism.
■ With renal disease, a high biological value protein should be used once the animal
resumes eating.
Activity
■ Normal when the pet returns home

Surgical Considerations
■  Resolve the hyperkalemia before surgery in order to avoid cardiac complications
Alternate Procedure

COMMENTS
Client Education
■ For renal patient, appropriate diet, water free choice, periodic evaluations by
veterinarian.
 For hypoadrenal patient, be aware of early signs of decompensation: loss of appetite,
weakness, and loss of vigor. Owners must provide maintenance medications lifelong

Potassium Disorders-
Hypokalemia
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Hypokalemia is a serum electrolyte disorder that occurs when the serum potassium
(K+) is less than 3.5 mEq/L (normal range is 3.5 to 5.5 mEq/L
 Occurs secondary to disorders of internal and/or external balance.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 Disorders of internal balance will translocate K+ from the extracellular space (ECF)
to the intracellular space (ICF).
Includes: metabolic alkalosis, insulin administration, increased levels of catechol.
amines, beta-adrenergic agonist treatment or intoxication, and refeeding syndrome.
Disorders of external balance are characterized by depletion.
Includes: renal potassium wasting (common in cats), inadequate intake, diuretic
drugs, osmotic and post-obstructive diuresis, inadequate parenteral fluid supplemen-
tation (iatrogenic), aldosterone-secreting tumor, vomiting and diarrhea, diabetic
ketoacidosis, and renal tubular acidosis.
 Most of the clinical signs are a result of impaired membrane sodium-potassium pump
influx into the cell which causes impaired organ function.
Systems Affected
■ Cardiovascular—hyperpolarization with complex conduction abnormalities and
impaired blood pressure control causing hypertension.
Endocrine/metabolic—glucose intolerance
■ Gastrointestinal—ileus
■ Musculoskeletal—weakness
■]
 Renalimpaired tubular function (cats)
Respiratory—-impaired ventilation from muscle weakness
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■Renal tubular acidosis can be familial.

BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ History usually provides clues to the underlying problem such as predisposing
 medical problems and current medications.
■ The most common clinical sign is muscle weakness.
Risk Factors
 Diabetes mellitus, body fluid losses, metabolic alkalosis, diuretic drugs, aldoster-
onoma, renal disease (cats).
Historical Findings
■Weakness
■Lethargy
■
 Mental depression
 Polydipsia/polyuria
 Sometimes vomiting—depending on cause
CLINICAL FEATURES
Dogs

BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
DIAGNOSTICS
■ History of underlying diseases, diet, and pattern of weakness all helpful.
■ Serum potassium concentration is absolute and confirmative.
■ Serum creatine kinase value might be elevated, and this may or may not represent
necrosis.
■ Abdominal ultrasound when searching for hyperaldosteronism.
 Serum aldosterone concentrations when searching for hyperaldosteronism.
Antiacetylcholinesterase receptor antibodies.
Pathological Findings
■ Rarely muscle necrosis
■Ileus
THERAPEUTICS
■Correct the cause
■ Replace potassium
Drug(s) of Choice
 Replace potassium deficits with potassium chloride solution intravenously or potas-
sium gluconate powder orally mixed in food.
 Replacement deficits can be corrected with potassium chloride l0% solution given
in amounts that are proportional to the severity of the hypokalemia—as shown in
the following table which provides two different methods (a and b) for providing
the potassium ions.

The intravenous rate of administration for mild to moderate hypokalemia should
usually not exceed 0.5 mEq/kg/hr, but for life-threatening hypokalemia (serum level
<l.5mEq/L) the rate can be increased to 1.5mEq/kg/hr along with simultaneous
ECG monitoring.
 Oral potassium gluconate is given as a powder added to food at a dose of 14 teaspoon-
ful (2 mEq) per 4.5 kg body weight twice daily.
 Potassium phosphate can be given if the patient is also markedly hypophosphatemic
One-half of the potassium replacement can be given intravenously at a dosage of
0.01-0.03 mmol/kg/hr over 6 hours.
Precautions/Interactions
mia, conduction defects and death.
Alternative Drugs
 Potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone might be indicated. The dose for
dogs is 2-4 mg/kg once daily and for the cat is 1.0 mg/kg twice daily.
 Mild hypokalemia can sometimes be corrected with foods high in potassium con-
centration such as bananas.
Diet
■ Diet should be balanced and contain adequate amounts of potassium.
Activity
■ The muscle weakness will limit the patient's activity.
■
Strength will return soon after a few days of eukalemia.
■]
 Return to exercise should be gradual over several days.
Surgical considerations
 Hypokalemic animals are an anesthetic risk because of the potential for cardiac dys-
rhythmias, especially at serum concentrations of <3.0 mEq/L.
 Any underlying metabolic alkalosis in addition to the hypokalemia should be cor-
rected prior to surgery, if possible.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Any necessary dietary adjustments should be followed.
■ Any need for continued potassium supplementation should be delivered.
Patient Monitoring
■ Frequency will depend on underlying cause and the correction of the underlying
problem.
909
BLAC KWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Prevention/Avoidance
■ All intravenous fluids that do not contain potassium should be supplemented
so long as the patient is tolerant to this cation (i.e.acute renal failure or acute
hypoadrenocorticism).
■ Patients on potassium losing diuretics should have ample amounts of potassium in
their diets.
Possible Complications
■ Accidental overload of potassium salts during replacement treatment
Cardiac arrhythmias if hypokalemia persists
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ All signs are reversible.
■ Underlying cause must be treated as well.
■ Prognosis is good to excellent.

Proptosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Proptosis of the globe occurs when there is acute trauma that results in forward
displacement of the globe such that when the extraocular and eyelid muscles contract
in response to the displacement, the globe is prevented from returning to its normal
position in large part by the abnormal eyelid position and the retrobulbar hemor-
rhage and edema (Figure 80.1).
 Proptosis is usually a unilateral occurrence, but bilateral traumatic proptosis can
occur.
■ Proptosis often leads to blindness in the affected eye. Secondary bradycardia may
occur via the oculocardiac reflex
 Figure 80.1 Severe proptosis in a Boston terrier. This eye is not salvageable and will be enucleated.
607
809
BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■Proptosis usually occurs due to a traumatic event. Often it occurs to a new dog being
introduced to a new home and often over food or when the established dog exerts
him or herself in defining certain boundaries to the new dog.
■ It can also occur when a collar around the neck is pulled quickly or suddenly.
■ Grooming nooses have also been involved in cases of proptosis in certain dogs.
■ Scruffing the fur at the back of the neck can also result in proptosis in predisposed
breeds.
Systems Affected
Ophthalmic
■ Blindness due to optic nerve inflammation, severing, or atrophy, or severe hyphema
■Lagophthalmos
■ Lateral strabismus
■ Keratoconjunctivitis sicca
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■No age or sex predilection for this condition.
 Brachycephalic breeds are more prone to proptosis than mesocephalic and dolicho-
cephalic breeds (Figure 80.2).
 Figure 80.2 Pugs are just one brachycephalic breed that are predisposed to proptosis
PROPTOSIS
609
 Brachycephalic breeds tend to have a much shallower orbit and a wider palpebral
fissure.
Historical Findings
 Dog or cat cannot close the eye.
Severe redness and swelling all the way around the eye.
■ The eye has "popped” out.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Dogs and Cats
■ Forward displacement of the globe
■
Mild to severe chemosis
■
 Mild to severe subconjunctival hemorrhage (see Figure 80.2)
 Possible hyphema
■Possible anisocoria
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Dogs and Cats
■ Moderate to severe exophthalmos due to trauma, cellulitis, abscess, or mass.
 The position of the lids differentiates proptosis from exophthalmos. If the lid margins
can be easily seen and identified, and they are not rolled inward, then the eye is
exophthalmic and not proptosed.
Sometimes severe exophthalmos and proptosis are treated similarly in order to take
care of the globe and the ocular surface.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ CBC, serum chemistry profle, urinalysis are usually normal unless the patient has
sustained more physical trauma than to just the eye.
 Skull radiographs may be useful if orbital fractures are suspected.
THERAPEUTICS
 Keep cornea lubricated.
■]
 Perform physical examination before anesthetizing patient to reposition the globe.
 Treat the patient for shock or head trauma, if necessary, before performing surgery.
610
 Figure 80.3 Preplaced sutures during repositioning of the proptosed globe. This eye is filled with blood, and
the likelihood of restoring vision is poor. Another treatment choice in the patient would be enucleation
Repositioning the Globe
■ This should be done as soon as possible, as long as the patient is stable.
■
 This may be done using sedation and local anesthesia if necessary but is likely more
efficiently done using general anesthesia, as long as the patient is stable.
■  Pre-place two to three temporary tarsorrhaphy horizontal mattress sutures using a
nonabsorbable 4-0 or 5-0 suture (Figure 80.3). The suture should enter or exit the
eyelid margin at the level of the meibomian glands and not the conjunctival surface
of the eyelid. Splitting the thickness of the eyelid like this will most likely keep the
suture material from making contact with the cornea and causing an ulcer. If it is
too difficult to pass the needle precisely through the eyelid margin with the globe
proptosed, the sutures may be passed full thickness through the lid to reposition the
globe. Once repositioned, the sutures are replaced with appropriately positioned
tarsorrhaphy sutures.
■ Lateral canthotomy may relieve some of the eyelid tension and aid in preplacement
of the sutures.
 Apply an appropriate antibiotic ophthalmic ointment (i.e., neomycin, polymyxin B.
bacitracin) to the cornea.
■ Using a scalpel handle over the cornea but under the preplaced sutures, the globe is
held in place while gentle traction is placed on the all sutures simultaneously, bring-
 ing the eyelids forward and in proper position over the globe.
 Tarsorrhaphy sutures are tied or replaced. Additional sutures are placed if necessary.
The lateral canthotomy is closed. Usually the medial canthus is open a few millime-
ters so ophthalmic medications may be applied.
PROPTOSIS
Enucleation of the Globe
 Should be considered if:
■
 The owner is unable to make follow-up appointments and take care of the eye if
further care is necessary after replacement of globe.
■The eye has ruptured.
■ Three or more extraocular muscles have been torn.
■ The eye is completely filled with blood.
Drug(s) of Choice
■Systemic antibiotics should be used at least 7 to 14 days.
■ Topical antibiotics should be used as long as sutures are in place. Frequency and
 Systemic anti-inflammatory steroidal should be used, if the patient can tolerate it.
■ Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are effective as well if corticosteroids cannot be
used.
■ Topical corticosteroids may be used if cornea is not significantly damaged and if
uveitis or hyphema are significant.
■  Topical atropine relieves ciliary body muscle spasm and dilates the pupil to try and
prevent posterior synechiae formation.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Do not use topical corticosteroids if the cornea is unhealthy.
■]
 Do not use systemic corticosteroids if intraocular or retrobulbar infection is likely.
Secondary bradycardia may occur via the oculocardiac reflex when manipulating the
globe. Have atropine ready if necessary, although premedication with glycopyrrolate
Activity
■ Walks using a leash and harness should be fine until the eye has healed. Keep the
animal indoors or in a well-controlled environment until healing is complete.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ The patient should be kept quiet and the area around the eye clean while it is
healing.
■ Keep other animals from licking the affected eye.
■ An Elizabethan collar may be necessary to protect the eye, and is recommended.
■ Administer ophthalmic solutions or suspensions before applying ophthalmic
ointments.
Patient Monitoring
■ Monitor for excessive discharge from eye, and for excessive swelling, heat, or pain
when opening mouth or eating. which may indicate orbital abscess formation.
■ First recheck examination should be 5 to 7 days after repositioning the globe. Much
 of the retrobulbar hemorrhage and swelling may be reduced and significant suture
loosening may occur at this time. This recheck is to make sure suture placement is
still acceptable and not causing problems for the corneal surface.
■ Sutures are usually removed sequentially and not all at the same time, starting at 10
to 14 days after repositioning. The last suture may not be removed until 3 to 4 weeks
 after placement or longer, if appropriate eyelid function has not returned, and there
is still risk of drying out or injury to the ocular surface due to exposure.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ This injury is usually accidental and very sudden. Be careful introducing brachyce-
phalic dogs to large dogs.
Possible Complications
■Lateral or dorsolateral strabismus due to extraocular muscle avulsion. May improve
or worsen with time.
■ Keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
■Neurotrophic keratitis.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ If the globe can be successfully replaced, and severe hyphema is not present, then
there is a chance some vision may be preserved.
■ Prognosis for vision is usually poor, regardless of how quickly the globe is
repositioned.
 ai s oi   r o o n a s sio 
■  Positive menace response, direct pupillary light reflex in injured eye and a consensual
 pupillary light reflex in normal eye; better prognosis for maintaining vision, but still
 guarded because damage to the eye may still be occurring.
■ Pupil size or response not necessarily an accurate indicator of visual outcome.

Pulmonary
Thromboembolism (PTE)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■Occlusion of the pulmonary arterial system with thrombi that may arise from distant
sites
■ Usually refers to thrombi, however, in some situations the term is also used for para-
sites, fat, or neoplastic cells
 PTE is a secondary phenomenon; evidence of a predisposing cause is beneficial in
diagnosis and therapy.
]
 Prevalence in cats estimated at 0.06 percent; bimodal distribution with maximum at
0 to 2 and 10 to 12 years of age
 Prevalence in dogs estimated at 0.9 percent
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Stasis of blood, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability (collectively referred to
Pulmonary vascular resistance increases due to mechanical obstruction of blood flow
and vasoactive mediators released from the thrombus causing vasoconstriction of the
vessels.
■ PTE is considered a secondary condition.
Systems Affected

■Jugular distention/pulsation
■ Clinical signs of right-sided heart failure
■ Pleural effusion
■Ascites
 Respiratory
Sudden onset respiratory distress (58 to 96 percent of dogs, 55 percent of cats)

BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Possibly normal lung sounds
Abnormal gas exchange
Altered ventilatory control
Hypoxia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, increased alveolar dead space,
 and intrapulmonary or intracardiac right-to-left shunting
Hypoxia can be made worse by edema due to overperfusion to nonthrombosed
pulmonary tissue.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY

■Asthma (bronchitis) in cats
DIAGNOSTICS
 Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are not specific for PTE and there is not a
definitive diagnostic test.
■ Lack of clinical suspicion contributes to the difficulty in diagnosis.
 Presence of predisposing factors may be best indication to pursue diagnostics
for PTE.

■Thoracic radiography
Normal (l0 to 30 percent of dogs and 14 percent of cats with PTE on
postmortem)
■ Possibly hypovascular lung regions
■  Interstitial to alveolar lung infiltrates that do not correlate with the degree of
respiratory distress
■ Enlarged pulmonary arteries (especially centrally) with vascular tapering and
oligemia
■ Cardiomegaly and pleural effusion common in both dogs and cats
619
1Echocardiography
■ Potential to visualize thrombus if in proximal pulmonary arteries or right-sided
heart
■ Poorly contracting right ventricle
■ Leftward shift of the septum during part of the cardiac cycle
Pulmonary artery dilation
 High-velocity tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonic insufficiency jets
 These can be used to estimate the pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pul-
■ Pulmonary artery systolic pressure = 4 × (velocity of tricuspid regurgitation
jet) + estimated right atrial pressure
 Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure = 4 x (pulmonary insufficiency end-dia-
stolic velocity)
■ Diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension is not analogous to PTE; it may
increase index of suspicion when combined with other diagnostic tests.
 Pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy is accepted as safe and sensitive but only available
at some referral institutions.
■ Involves intravenous injection of technetium labeled macroaggregated albumin
■ Perfusion deficits can also occur in nonventilated regions with reflex
vasoconstriction.
■ Ventilation/perfusion scan is a perfusion scan combined with a ventilation scan using
technetium labeled radioaerosol.
■Increases sensitivity
■ Uncommonly performed in veterinary medicine
■]
 Because it cannot differentiate all primary pulmonary parenchymal diseases from
PTE it is frequently not definitive.
■Pulmonary angiography
■ Most sensitive and specific test but uncommonly performed due to need for
 general anesthesia in veterinary patients
■ Nonionic contrast should be used to minimize systemic hypotension
■ Patients with pulmonary hypertension are at increased risk of complications due
to the procedure.
■ Diagnosis of PTE includes intraluminal flling defect in the pulmonary artery
or abrupt vessel occlusion and visualization of the trailing edge of the
thromboembolism.
Spiral computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with angiography are
commonly used in human medicine but the need for general anesthesia limits their
use in veterinary medicine.
Pathologic Findings
■  Pulmonary emboli visible
■ Pleural effusion
■ Concurrent pulmonary pathology
■
 Bronchopneumonia
■ Pulmonary edema
620
■ Pulmonary neoplasia
 Interstitial fibrosis
■ Pulmonary calcification
■Emphysema
■Hyaline membrane disease
■ Most common primary postmortem diagnoses included immune mediated hemolytic
anemia, sepsis, and amyloidosis.
■Most dogs have multiple disease processes.
THERAPEUTICS
 If primary cause can be identified, treatment should be instituted.
■ Symptomatic respiratory support
■
 Supplemental oxygen
■ Positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation may be required.
■Anticoagulant therapy
■ Heparin: After baseline PT and aPTT and ACT initial intravenous dose of
100 to 300U/kg given followed by 100 to 300U/kg SQ or IV every 6 to 8
hours. The dose is adjusted to maintain the aPTT at one and a half to two times
normal.
■ Low molecular weight heparin
■  More expensive than heparin but cost is theoretically balanced by not needing
to evaluate coagulation times
■ Dalteparin dose (dog and cat): 100 to 1501U/kg SQ every 12 to 24
hours
■ Enoxaparin dose (dog and cat): 1 mg/kg SQ every 12 to 24 hours
1Warfarin
Coagulation times must be closely monitored and are more difficult to
regulate.
 Uncommonly used
 If used, heparin must be administered during the initial hypercoagulable period
(usually 5-7 days) due to warfarin effects on protein C.
Warfarin doses:
■ Dog: 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg PO every 24 hours
■ Cat: 0.1 to 0.2 mg per cat PO every 24 hours
Antiplatelet drugs (i.e., aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlodipine)
 Used primarily for prevention in patients considered at high risk
Clopidogrel doses
Cat:
18.75 to 75 mg once daily in the cat
■ Dog: Doses in the dog have not been published to date.
■Aspirin doses
 Dog: 0.5mg/kg PO every 12 to 24 hours
■Cat:
:5 to 8l mg PO every 72 hours
Cautious use of parenteral fluids
 Hypotension may be present because of pulmonary arterial obstruction and imped-
ance to left heart filling and may be aided by fluids.
■ Aggressive fluid therapy can further increase right-sided heart filling, displacing
the intraventricular septum to the left further impeding left-sided heart filling and
compromising cardiac output.
Thrombolytic therapy (rt-PA, streptokinase)
 Not commonly used and reserved for early use
 Excessive bleeding and not uncommonly fatal bleeding is possible.
■ rt-PA activates bound plasminogen making it more “clot specific".
■ Dog rt-PA dose:  1 mg/kg IV every 60 minutes for a total of 10 doses
■ Cat rt-PA dose: 0.25 to lmg/kg per hour for a total dose of 1 to
10 mg/kg IV
 Streptokinase is not fibrin dependent and therefore leads to a systemic lytic
state.
■ Dog streptokinase dose: 90,000IU loading dose over 30 minutes followed by
CRI of 45.000 IU/hour for 7 to 12 hours
■ Alternatively a loading dose of 15,000 to 18.000 IU/kg can be used followed by
same CRI protocol.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■Most client information provided will be related to primary disease.
 For patients on anticoagulant therapy, the owner should monitor for bruising or
bleeding.
Patient Monitoring
■ Monitor patients response to therapy (respiratory rate and effort and serial blood gas
analysis).
■ Monitor coagulation times (aPTT and PT) carefully.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Patients with a primary condition that makes them at increased risk for PTE can be
placed on prophylactic anticoagulant therapy.
Possible Complications
 Use of thrombolytic agents or anticoagulants increase the patients chances of hemor-
rhage and should be monitored closely.

Pulmonary Contusions
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Syndrome that causes pulmonary parenchymal and alveolar damage secondary
to compressive and decompressive forces associated with blunt trauma to the
thorax.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Compression then decompression of the thorax during blunt thoracic trauma
transfers the energy or mechanical force to the pulmonary parenchyma and
alveoli. The result is damage to the parenchyma and alveolar capillary membrane
P d pn     d p p  
space results in areas of lung with a ventilation/perfusion mismatch and
hypoxia.
1 Following initial injury, influx of fluid and inflammatory cells into the damaged area
can perpetuate the pulmonary damage and injury by the generation of oxygen-
derived fre radical species and oxidative damage to the lung, and cause secondary
lung injury. Depending on the extent of damage, ALI or ARDS can result.
Systems Affected
 Respiratory—areas of lung that are perfused but not ventilated well cause a ventila.
tion/perfusion mismatch and hypoxia, tachypnea, orthopnea, restrictive respiratory
pattern and hemoptysis may be present; can progress to ALI or ARDS
 Other body systems are affected secondary to hypoxia.
Incidence/Prevalence
 Reported in 34 to 57 percent of dogs and 18 percent of cats with limb fractures fol-
lowing motor vehicle trauma.
■ Occurs in approximately 50 percent of animals with thoracic trauma.
Geographic Distribution
■Worldwide

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Differentiating Causes
Coagulopathy
■ Hemothorax or pulmonary hemorrhage from vitamin K antagonist rodenticide
intoxication
■ Can be differentiated from pulmonary contusions by coagulation tests, as ACT and
 PTs will be markedly prolonged with vitamin K antagonism. Severe thrombocytope-
nia <50,000 platelet/μul can be associated with pulmonary hemorrhage.
Neoplastic Cause of Pulmonary Hemorrhage

thoracic radiographs
Diaphragmatic Hernia
■Loss of detail in pleural cavity, loss of demarcation of diaphragm, possible inclusion
of abdominal contents in thorax
■ Cardiac failure with pulmonary edema

 Inhaled or ingested toxins, such as paraquat
 Bacterial or viral pneumonia
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
 Not specific for pulmonary contusions, changes such as anemia, neutrophilic leuko-
cytosis, or elevations in liver enzyme activities may be associated with trauma but
not related to pulmonary contusion, per se.
■ Urinalysis is usually normal unless damage to the kidneys or urinary bladder has
occurred secondary to trauma.
Other Laboratory Tests
 PT or ACT to rule out vitamin K antagonist rodenticide toxicity
 Platelet count to rule out severe thrombocytopenia and secondary pulmonary
hemorrhage
Diagnostic Procedures
Thoracic Imaging
■  Thoracic radiographs should be performed only after cardiovascular and pulmonary
stabilization of the patient, whenever possible.

PULMONARY CONTUSIONS
■ The use of furosemide is controversial and not currently recommended because it
could potentially worsen hypovolemic shock.
Contraindications
 Diuretic drugs such as furosemide have not been shown to be efficacious and can
exacerbate hypovolemic shock.
 The use of NSAIDs in any traumatized patient is controversial and not recommended
until the patient is normotensive and renal function has been proven to be normal.
AntibioticsLess than 5 percent of patients with traumatic pulmonary contusions
develop respiratory infections secondary to injury. The use of empiric antibiotics in
resistance, and is therefore, contraindicated.
■Overzealous crystalloid fluid therapy can be associated with worsening of pulmonary
contusions; fluid therapy should be titrated according to patient's blood pressure and
cardiovascular perfusion parameters.
COMMENTS
 Patient Monitoring
■ Monitor respiratory rate and effort, mucous membrane color, presence of hemopty-
sis, respiratory difficulty/orthopnea, respiratory sound on thoracic auscultation:
serial measurements of blood pressure, pulse quality, pulse oximetry or arterial
blood gas analysis. ECG to evaluate for traumatic myocarditis and cardiac
dysrhythmias.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Avoid interactions with motor vehicles and large animals or fall from height.
■ Leash restriction or run in enclosed area, away from traffic.
Possible Complications
■ARDS
■ Bacterial pneumonia (extremely rare)
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Potential to worsen over first 24 hours post-injury
■
 Most patients will be able to be discharged within 36 hours of initial injury.
 Severe contusions may require assisted ventilation with positive end-expiratory pres-
sure until wounds heal.
 Potential for development of ARDS and death in severe cases, risk increases with the
degree of multitrauma.

Pulmonary Edema-
Cardiogenic
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary inter-
stitial space and alveoli subsequent to left-sided cardiac dysfunction and elevations
in pulmonary venous and pulmonary capillary pressures.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Cardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur secondary to any heart condition that
impairs function of the left side of the heart, including diseases that promote volume
overload, systolic dysfunction, or diastolic dysfunction.
1 With progressive cardiac dysfunction, left atrial, pulmonary venous and pulmonary
capillary hydrostatic pressures increase.
 Pulmonary edema develops when the net movement of fluid, colloid, and solutes
from the vasculature into the interstitial space exceeds its return to the circulation.
 Cardiogenic pulmonary edema impairs gas exchange and lung mechanics and may
ultimately lead to death.
 Common congenital lesions that contribute to the development of pulmonary edema
include:
■Left-to-right shunting PDA
■ Left-to-right shunting ventricular septal defect
■Mitral valve dysplasia
■Subaortic stenosis (uncommonly)
 Common acquired conditions that contribute to the development of pulmonary
edema include:
■Chronic degenerative mitral valve disease (dogs)
■Dilated cardiomyopathy (dogs)
■Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (cats)
Systems Affected
  Respiratory—-Cardiogenic pulmonary edema impairs gas exchange and reduces lung
compliance.
629
 Cardiovascular—While cardiac dysfunction often leads to the development of car
 genesis and further impair cardiac function.
■ Musculoskeletal—-Hypoxemia contributes to weakness
■ Nervous—-Hypoxemia may contribute to depression and lethargy or when combined
with arrhythmias or activity contribute to syncope.
 Hepatobiliary—Concurrent right-sided congestion may contribute to cholestasis and
ascites.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 The signalment varies based on the cardiac disease that leads to the development of
pulmonary edema.
■ Left-to-right shunting PDAs can be seen in any young dog but females and many
small breed dogs, including Chihuahuas, Maltese, toy and miniature poodles,
 Pomeranians, Bichon Frise, Cavalier King Charles spaniels, and Shetland sheep-
dogs are reportedly overrepresented.
 Chronic degenerative mitral valve disease is most common in middle-aged to older
small breed dogs.
■ Dilated cardiomyopathy is more commonly identified in middle-aged to older
large to giant breed dogs with boxers, Doberman pinschers, Great Danes, and Irish
wolfhounds reportedly overrepresented.
■ Purebread cats including Maine coon cats and Ragdolls have identified genetic
alterations that may contribute to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy although the
disease is also commonly diagnosed in domestic shorthair and domestic longhair
cats.
■ Depending on the etiology and severity of the cardiac disease and the presence of
rapid-onset of life-threatening respiratory compromise.
Risk Factors/Causes
 Cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., development of atrial fibrillation or significant ventricular
ectopy) may reduce cardiac performance and precipitate the development of pulmo-
nary edema.
■ General anesthesia and intravenous fluids in animals with otherwise compensated
 yet severe cardiac disease may precipitate the development of pulmonary edema.
 Difficult to predict events, like rupture of chordae tendinea in dogs with mitral valve
disease or systemic thromboembolization in cats; may be associated with the rapid
development of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Historical Findings
■Coughing (dogs)
PULMONARY EDEMA—CARDIOGENIC
631
 Tachypnea, dyspnea, open-mouth breathing.
■ These signs may be exacerbated during recumbency.
■ Exercise intolerance.
 Inappetence and weight loss.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Dogs
■Almost always have a cardiac murmur or gallop.
■Arrhythmias may be audible.
 Coughing, tachypnea, dyspnea, or orthopnea.
There may be audible crackles and wheezes during pulmonary auscultation.
■
Many dogs with cardiogenic pulmonary edema will be tachycardic.
 Severe edema may be accompanied by expectoration of pink foam or cyanosis.
Cats
■ Often have a cardiac murmur or gallop.
Arrhythmias may be audible.
 Tachypnea, dyspnea, open-mouth breathing.
 Crackles may be audible although some cats with pulmonary edema have concurrent
pleural effusion, which diminishes lung sounds and may produce an audible fluid
line.
Some cats will present bradycardic and hypothermic.
Some cats present with concurrent systemic thromboembolization.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Pneumonia
 Pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension
Heartworm disease
 Tracheal collapse
■Feline asthma
■ Obstructive lung disease
■Bronchitis
■ Pulmonary fibrosis
Neoplasia
■
 Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema
Pulmonary contusions
Inflammatory respiratory disease
 Many dogs and cats with these disorders have concurrent cardiac disease that could
lead to a false assumption of cardiogenic pulmonary edema if treatment decisions
are based only on the physical examination.
DIAGNOSTICS
■Animals with cardiogenic pulmonary edema may be in extremely critical condition
and the diagnostic tests performed must be dictated by the clinical situation.
Thoracic radiographs
■ Common hallmarks of cardiogenic pulmonary edema in dogs include left atrial
enlargement (Figure 83.l), pulmonary venous congestion, and perihilar intersti-
tial edema.
■ As the pulmonary edema progresses and alveoli are flooded, it obscures the pul-
monary vessels and produces air bronchograms, often in the perihilar region and
right caudal lung lobe.
■ Severe, fulminant congestive heart failure may produce diffuse alveolar disease
(Figure 83.2).
■ Instead of the classic pattern of cardiogenic pulmonary edema in dogs, cats tend
 to have left auricular enlargement on the ventrodorsal or dorsoventral view and
their patterns of pulmonary edema tend to be patchy and unevenly distributed
(Figure 83.3).
■ Limitations of thoracic radiography include a time lag between the onset and
clearance of pulmonary edema in comparison to clinical signs and the presence
 of pre-existing lung pathology obscuring identification of pulmonary edema.
■Electrocardiography
 Although electrocardiography is not able to diagnose pulmonary edema it can
identify arrhythmias that may warrant institution of antiarrhythmic therapy.

congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve disease

634 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Echocardiography
■ Although echocardiography is not able to diagnose pulmonary edema, it is very
useful for detecting the presence and severity of underlying cardiac disease and
guiding therapy tailored for that disease.
■Cardiac catheterization
■ Placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter to measure pulmonary arterial pressures and
estimate left atrial pressure is rarely performed but may be useful for guiding
therapy in animals with severe, life-threatening pulmonary edema or those with
refractory congestive heart failure.
■ Biochemical profile
■ Severe cardiac compromise may reduce the glomerular filtration rate and make it
 n  ss n    o  
reduction.
■ Electrolyte imbalances may exacerbate arrhythmias, reduce the effectiveness of
some therapeutics, or increase the likelihood of developing drug toxicities
■Measurement of natriuretic peptides
■ Recent studies suggest measurement of natriuretic peptides, including atrial natri-
uretic peptide or B-type natriuretic peptide, may help identify animals with severe
cardiac compromise and may be useful at distinguishing animals with respiratory
distress of cardiac origin and noncardiac origin.
THERAPEUTICS
 The therapeutic objectives for the management of cardiogenic pulmonary edema
include resolution of the pulmonary edema, maintenance of adequate tissue perfu-
sion pressure, and adequate delivery of blood flow to vital tissues. To achieve these
goals it is important to use drugs with proven hemodynamic benefits and a rapid
onset of action.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Oxygen
viding an oxygen-enriched environment (i.e., oxygen cage) or via nasal
insufflation.
■Furosemide
■2 to 4 mg/kg IV (dogs) and 1 to 2 mg/kg IV (cats)
■  These large doses may need to be repeated (initially every 1 to 2 hours) until the
respiratory rate and dyspnea start to decline.
■Once stable the dose should be reduced to 0.5 to 2mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours, as
dictated by clinical status.
  os    sse    s  
because excessive administration may lead to profound dehydration, electrolyte
depletion, renal failure, low cardiac output, and circulatory collapse.
PULMONARY EDEMA—CARDIOGENIC635
 In dogs with severe mitral valve insufficiency (often those complicated with ruptured
chordae tendineae) or severe dilated cardiomyopathy additional therapies that may
be required include:
■  Nitroprusside: a potent balanced vasodilator.
■ Constant rate infusion typically administered at 2 to 5 μg/kg per minute, diluted
in 5% dextrose.
■  It is light sensitive and should not be infused with other agents so a second
intravenous catheter should be placed for administration of additional intrave-
nous drugs.
  It promotes profound preload and afterload reduction so blood pressure should
be continuously monitored.
 Rapid administration rates may produce cyanide toxicity.
■Discontinuation or a reduction in the infusion rate often promptly reverses side
effects.
■ Dobutamine: a rapid acting positive inotropic agent.
           
diluted in 5% dextrose.
Although tachycardia/arrhythmias and vasodilation are uncommonly reported
ideally continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring is performed.
■ Discontinuation or a reduction in the infusion rate often promptly reverses side
effects.
■ Although not as potent as nitroprusside and dobutamine, in animals where it is
impractical to administer these therapies attempts may be made to substitute
either:
Pimobendan,0.25 mg/kg PO twice a day
or
Hydralazine, 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg PO twice a day
 Sedative/tranquilizers: some animals with profound anxiety associated with their
pulmonary edema may benefit from sedation.
 Long-term management of animals with a history of cardiogenic pulmonary edema
often includes diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, positive ino-
tropes, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, anti-arrhythmics, or other drug classes
as dictated by the underlying disease.
Precautions/Interactions
■In animals with known cardiogenic pulmonary edema, intravenous fluids, other than
those used to prepare a constant rate infusion, should be avoided.
Potent afterload reducers should be used cautiously in cats with hypertrophic car-
diomyopathy complicated by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.
Diet
 During the acute management of cardiogenic pulmonary edema food and water
should be withheld.
636  BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Once stabilized animals may have access to restricted water and food
consumption
■  Low-sodium diets may be beneficial in the long-term management of animals with
 a previous history of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Activity
■ During the acute management of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, strict rest should
be implemented.
■ After discharge, limited exercise can be resumed at the leisure of the animal but
strenuous exercise should be avoided.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Clients should be informed that in most instances the medications will need to be
administered throughout the remainder of the animal's life.
■ Clients should be educated about the importance of periodic rechecks and should
be instructed to monitor for clinical signs that may signify recurrence of cardiogenic
pulmonary edema.
Patient Monitoring
■ Reductions in the respiratory rate and effort are the most reliable clinical signs that
the cardiogenic pulmonary edema is resolving. These should be monitored and
recorded at a minimum of hourly.
■  Urine production should be monitored throughout hospitalization.
■ A reduction in the body weight may suggest effective diuresis
■ Radiographic findings often lag behind clinical signs so treatment should be based
on clinical status in addition to results of diagnostic tests.
■ Mild, presumably prerenal azotemia and electrolyte imbalances are common in
animals treated for congestive heart failure. Biochemical profiles should be performed
at initial presentation and 5 to 7 days after institution of therapy/discharge from the
hospital to monitor the renal status.
 Radiographs should be rechecked approximately 5 to 7 days after institution of
 therapy/discharge from the hospital to assess the eficacy of therapy.
■ Additional follow up is dictated by the underlying cardiac disease, patient status and
complicating factors.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Owners may not be able to specifically prevent the recurrence of pulmonary edema
but they should make every effort to:
 Closely monitor their animal's attitude, respiratory rate, appetite, and activity level
daily.
PULMONARYEDEMA—CARDIOGENIC
637
■Develop a strict routine for administration and timing of cardiac medications.
including radiographs, biochemical profiles, ECGs, and echocardiograms.
Possible Complications
 Complications, or side effects, of therapy are polyuria and polydipsia.
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema often recurs as the cardiac disease progresses and
clinical signs return or animals may die suddenly
Expected course and Prognosis
 Severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema is usually fatal if not treated rapidly and
effectively.
■ With appropriate treatment and monitoring, the short-term prognosis for animals
with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, assuming they respond appropriately to therapy
and complicating factors (e.g., severe cardiac arrhythmias, ruptured chordae tendin-
eae, systemic thromboembolization) are absent, is fair.
 Animals with concurrent severe renal insufficiency or acute renal failure have a poor
short-term prognosis.
Most animals with heart disease that is severe enough to produce pulmonary edema
have a guarded long-term prognosis and many ultimately succumb to their heart
disease. The overall median survival time is dependent on the particular disease, the
presence of complicating factors, and the individual response to therapy.

Pulmonary Hypertension
(PHT)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ PHT is present when the mean, sustained pulmonary arterial pressure is greater than
25 mm Hg. MPAP is related to the PVR and PBF as evidenced in the equation:
MPAP = (PVR ×PBF)+ mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
 Historically PHT was classified as either primary (idiopathic) or secondary. But fol-
lowing identification that some conditions within the category of secondary PHT
resembled idiopathic disease pathologically and in their response to treatment, the
World Health Organization introduced a new classification scheme devised on the
basis of mechanisms. The groups, with examples of associated veterinary conditions.
are as follows:
■ Group I: Pulmonary arterial hypertension
Idiopathic.
■
 PHT associated with systemic to pulmonary shunts.
■PHT associated with portal hypertension.
■ PHT associated with drugs/toxins.
■ Group Il: Pulmonary venous hypertension
■Mitral valve insufficiency/mitral stenosis.
■ Myocardial disease with elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure.
1 Group Ill: PHT associated with chronic respiratory disease/hypoxemia.
■Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
■ Interstitial lung disease.
■  Chronic exposure to high altitude.
■ Group IV: PHT associated with chronic pulmonary thromboembolism
■ Group V: PHT due to miscellaneous disorders directly affecting the pulmonary
vasculature
Heartworms (Diroflaria immitus)
Angiostrongylus vasorum
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 The principal vascular changes that produce PHT include vasoconstriction, smooth-
muscle cell and endothelial cell proliferation, and thrombosis. These processes
689
640 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
reduce the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary arterial bed and the pulmonary
compliance thereby increasing PVR.
  Pulmonary endothelial cell dysfunction or injury likely contribute to these homeo-
static imbalances via alteration of the complex interactions between various vasodila-
tors (e.g. prostacyclin, nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictors (e.g., thromboxane A,
endothelin-l, serotonin). growth inhibitors and mitogenic factors, and antithrom-
botic and prothrombotic determinants.
  s    r s s soa  
cardial and valvular disease in dogs may contribute to increased pulmonary arterial
pressures via retrograde transmission of left atrial pressure to the pulmonary vascular
bed, hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arteries, endothelial dys-
function, and vascular remodeling.
■ Animals with PHT secondary to chronic respiratory disease presumably develop
elevated pulmonary arterial pressure as a result from direct damage from the primary
disorder, hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction, and vascular remodeling
Systems Affected
■Respiratory
■ Coughing, respiratory distress, and tachypnea may manifest as a result of any
primary underlying pulmonary disease.
■ Vascular remodeling and hypoxemia of exertion associated with PHT may also
independently
reduce lung compliance and contribute to respiratory
compromise.
■Cardiovascular
■  Increased pulmonary arterial pressure contributes to right ventricular concentric
hypertrophy in an effort to normalize ventricular wall stress.
■ Depending on the speed with which it develops and its severity, PHT may ulti-
mately increase right ventricular end-diastolic and right atrial pressures producing
right-sided heart failure.
  Exertional syncope may occur secondary to hypoxemia, exercise-induced vasodi-
lation, and an inability to increase cardiac output/pulmonary blood flow, dys-
rhythmias or reflex-induced bradycardia and hypotension have also been
hypothesized to contribute to syncope.
■ Musculoskeletal
■Hypoxemia
 Ventilation/perfusion mismatch
■ Lactic acidosis
■ Fixed cardiac output contributes to exercise intolerance and possibly weakness.
■Nervous
■Hypoxemia may contribute to depression and lethargy.
■When combined with dysrhythmias or activity, PHT contributes to syncope.
■Hepatobiliary
 Concurrent right-sided congestion may contribute to cholestasis
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PHT)
641
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 The signalment varies greatly based on the etiology that produces the PHT. Population
characteristics from two large retrospective studies identified an age range from 2
months to 17 years although the largest percentages of dogs in both studies were
younger than 10 years of age. Similarly there is a wide weight distribution wherein
dogs weighed between 2 and 67 kg. There is no apparent sex predilection and it is
■]
 Dogs predisposed to degenerative mitral valve disease will be at increased risk for
developing pulmonary venous hypertension.
 Geographic distribution and heartworm preventative status may increase the like-
lihood of PHT associated with heartworm disease.
■ West Highland white terriers with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis may also be at
higher risk for development of PHT
Depending on the etiology, severity, and rate of onset of the PHTowners may report
a slow, insidious onset of clinical signs or an acute, rapid onset of life-threatening
respiratory compromise.
Risk Factors/Causes
 Conditions that contribute to hypercoagulable states (e.g. protein-losing nephropa-
thy hyperadrenocorticism, neoplasia, and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia) may
increase the risk for pulmonary thromboembolism and acute development of pul.
monary hypertension.
 Acute development of PHT secondary to embolization of Dirofilaria immitis may
occur following adulticide therapy.
 Large left-to-right congenital cardiac shunts may contribute to increased PBF and
vascular remodeling, both of which contribute to PHT.
Although it is generally accepted that dogs have low pulmonary vascular reactivity.
there is some risk of developing mild to moderate PHT resulting from chronic hypox-
emia associated with living at high altitude.

tests performed must be dictated by the clinical situation.
■Thoracic radiographs
■ Although thoracic radiographs are insensitive for identification of PHT they are
useful for evaluation of underlying pulmonary disease.
■ In severe cases of PHT dilation of the main pulmonary artery and right-sided heart
enlargement may be identified.

RV
 Figure 84.1 A diastolic frame from a dog with severe pulmonary hypertension identified right ventricular
(RV) dilation and thickening with interventricular septal flattening and reduced left ventricular (LV) diameters)
■ Peripheral pulmonary arterial markings may abruptly stop with pulmonary
thromboembolism.
■Electrocardiography
 Although electrocardiography is not able to diagnose PHT, it may identify patterns
of right ventricular enlargement, ST segment depression, or dysrhythmias that
warrant institution of anti-arrhythmic drugs.
■Echocardiography
 Two-dimensional, spectral, and color-flow Doppler echocardiography often allows
for the noninvasive assessment of PHT.
 Right ventricular concentric and eccentric hypertrophy may be identified in cases
of moderate to severe PHT in response to increased afterload, elevated end-dia-
stolic pressures and valvular insufficiencies.
 Diastolic (Figure 84.1) or systolic (Figure 84.2) interventricular septal flattening
may be identified when right ventricular pressure exceeds left ventricular
pressure.
■ Dilation of the pulmonary artery and main branches (Figure 84.3) may be
present.
■
 Small end-diastolic left ventricular diameters may be identified resulting from
reduced left ventricular preload in cases of severe PHT. This may also contribute
to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.
■  Pulmonic stenosis or other complex defects of the right ventricular outflow tract
can be ruled out as etiologies for the right ventricular hypertrophy.
■ Pulmonary arterial velocity profiles can be evaluated to increase the suspicion of
PHT in the absence of quantifiable valvular insufficiencies.

myocardial disease or congenital heart disease that may contribute to PHT.
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PHT)645
■ Nuclear imaging and computerized tomography may be useful for identification of
large pulmonary thromboemboli.
Cardiac catheterization
 Although infrequently performed, placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter to measure
 pulmonary arterial pressures, estimate left atrial pressure, perform thermodilution
measures of cardiac output and calculate PVR may be considered the gold standard
for the diagnosis of PHT.
■ Direct pulmonary arterial measures are further used in humans to assess the acute
vasoreactivity of the pulmonary arteries to short-acting vasodilators and enable
identification of candidates for chronic oral vasodilator therapy.
■  Pulmonary angiography may help identify  large pulmonary thromboemboli
although life-threatening complications have been reported in humans with
severe, acute PHT.
1A complete blood count, biochemical profile, urinalysis, and heartworm serology
should be performed to assess for underlying disease conditions that may contribute
to PHT or hypercoagulability. These diagnostics also allow for investigation of con-
sequences that may be attributable to the reduced cardiac output that frequently
accompanies acute, severe PHT
Pathologic Findings
  Dogs with PHT have been reported to have the same constrictive and complex lesions
as those identified in people including four main histologic subsets:
■ Isolated medial hypertrophy
■Medial hypertrophy-intimal thickening without plexiform lesion
 Variations of the plexiform lesion and medial hypertrophy-intimal thickening was
the most common pattern in one study.
 Isolated arteritis
 Pulmonary and cardiac lesions vary markedly in animals with primary lung or heart
disease, pulmonary thromboembolism, and heartworm disease.
THERAPEUTICS
■  The therapeutic objectives for the management of pulmonary hypertension would
ideally include (l) resolution of any underlying pulmonary disease or complicating
factor contributing to the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and (2) therapeutics
aimed at reducing the pulmonary arterial pressure.
■ Unfortunately many of the primary pulmonary diseases are severe and irreversible
by the time PHT is diagnosed.
 Similarly although vasodilatory agents would seem beneficial they may actually be
contraindicated in the face of PHT related to pulmonary disease as they could exac-
■ Further complicating the use of vasodilatory agents (e.g., amlodipine) is the fact
that most traditional arterial vasodilators more effectively reduce systemic arterial
pressures and may produce symptomatic hypotension in the face of fixed right ven-
tricular output.
■ Many of the new and potentially promising vasodilatory agents used in humans,
including endothelin receptor antagonists, constant rate infusion, and subcutaneous
and oral synthetic prostacyclin analogs, are often cost prohibitive or difficult to
administer in veterinary species
Drug(s) of Choice
■Oxygen
 Although dogs are generally accepted to have low pulmonary vascular reactivity.
 oxygen supplementation may be useful at reducing hypoxic induced arterial
vasoconstriction.
■ Sildenafil
■ A phosphodiesterase V inhibitor has been evaluated in a small number of dogs
retrospectively.
■  There are varying reports regarding its ability to reduce echocardiographically
determined pulmonary arterial pressure.
■ The retrospective studies suggest it may improve owner perceived clinical signs
and quality of life.
■ Whether the same results hold true in a prospective, large-scale, blinded study is
uncertain.
■ There are no studies that clearly define the appropriate dose of sildenafil for the
management of PHT in dogs but anecdotally the author has started with 1 to 2 mg/
kg PO every 12 hours safely.
■ Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and positive inotropes are used as indicated to treat val-
vular disease or myocardial disease that is contributing to PHT.
■Abdominocentesis or thoracocentesis may need to be performed in animals compro-
mised by ascites and pleural effusion, respectively.
  Atrial septostomy has been reported to improve hemodynamics and clinical signs in
some humans with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 Therapy in humans is usually palliative in an effort to prolong survival until a heart-
lung transplantation can be performed.
Precautions/Interactions
■  Excessive preload reduction may further limit cardiac output in animals with severe
PHT producing weakness, lethargy, syncope, or sudden death.
Activity
■Many animals with moderate to severe PHT display exercise intolerance and should
have restricted activity.
■ Moderate to severe PHT may produce exertional syncope and increased myocardial
oxygen demands may precipitate dysrhythmias.
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PHT)

COMMENTS
Client Education
 Clients should be informed that in most instances the medications will need to be
administered throughout the remainder of the animals life
 Clients should be educated about the importance of periodic rechecks and should
be instructed to monitor for clinical signs that may signify recurrence or progression
of PHT.
Patient Monitoring
■ Owners should be instructed to closely monitor general attitude, activity and exercise
tolerance, respiration, and presence of right-sided heart failure.
■Follow up diagnostic tests should be dictated by the underlying disease process that
is producing the PHT.
  Echocardiographic monitoring of pulmonary arterial pressure can be performed after
institution of sildenafil. Up-titration may be attempted based on clinical status, echo-
cardiographic findings and patient tolerance.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Owners should be cautioned about taking animals with moderate to severe PHT to
excessive elevations.
Possible Complications
 Reported complications that may be attributed to sildenafl therapy include lethargy
somnolence, clear nasal discharge, erect ears, and cutaneous flushing.
 One report suggests severe hypotension and death may develop if sildenafil is com-
bined with organic nitrates (i.e., nitroglycerin paste)
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ The expected course and prognosis for animals with PHT are difficult to define
because there are many etiologies that contribute to the disease.
Overall, with the exception of heartworm disease with resolution or reduction of
PHT following adulticide therapy the prognosis for animals with moderate to severe
pulmonary hypertension is guarded to grave.
 In most cases wherein PHT is secondary to chronic respiratory disease the underlying
■ Animals with mild to moderate PHT secondary to valvular disease or myocardial
disease have a fair short-term prognosis and guarded long-term prognosis assuming
the disease is progressive.

Pyometra
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Cystic endometrial hyperplasia—hormonally mediated, progressive pathologic
change in the uterine lining
invasion of the abnormal endometrium leads to intraluminal accumulation of puru-
lent exudate
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1Normal cycling bitches—2-month diestrus, with ovarian secretion of progesterone
after every estrus
 Repeated exposure of the endometrium to high concentrations of estrogen followed
by high concentrations of progesterone without pregnancy;leads to cystic endome-
trial hyperplasia
 Bacteria—uterine secretions provide excellent media for growth; ascend from the
vagina through the partially open cervix during proestrus and estrus; normal vaginal
flora; Escherichia coli most common isolate
Cats—may be the result of estrogen at estrus followed by a progestational phase,
caused by induction of ovulation by coitus, spontaneous ovulation, or other (as yet
undefined) stimuli
 Recent studies suggest that subclinical bacterial infections or foreign bodies may
trigger pyometra in the absence of classical CEH.
Systems Affected
 Reproductive—-accumulation of purulent material in uterine horns
■]
 Renal/urologic—bacterial toxins may impair renal function due to impaired ADH
activity and lead to isosthenuric or hypothenuric urine.
 Hemic/lymphatic/immune—-leukocytosis or leukopenia may be present
 Hepatobiliary—extrahepatic cholestasis with severe sepsis
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Older bitches and queens (younger than 6 years of age) are at greater risk
69
■Bitches with short interestrous intervals are at greater risk.
■ Pyometra may be more prevalent, or prevalent at younger ages, in some family lines.
Risk Factors/Causes
 Administration of estrogenic or progestagenic medications to intact females
■
Dogs—usually diagnosed 1 to 12 weeks after estrus
■ Cats—onset relative to estrus more variable
■ Pyometra of the uterine stump (stump pyometra) in spayed animals may develop
any time after ovariohysterectomy if exposed to estrogen from ovarian remnant or
exogenous source.
Historical Findings
■Open cervix: purulent or bloody vulvar discharge
 Closed cervix: no vulvar discharge

Pathological Findings
■ Endometrium (dogs and cats)—described as cobblestone (either condition)
Cystic endometrial surface—covered by malodorous, mucopurulent exudate; thick-
ened because of increased endometrial gland size and cystic gland distension
THERAPEUTICS
■ Determine if patient is desired for future breeding by owner and, if so, if she is a
candidate for medical therapy (not septic or systemically affected, no free fluid in
abdomen, uterine wall not thin, patient under the age of 6 years, owner willing to
breed on next cycle).
 If patient is not planned for future breeding, correct dehydration, support renal func-
tion, start antibiotic therapy and perform ovariohysterectomy.
■ If patient is to be treated medically, start antibiotics pending culture results, and
begin therapy with prostaglandin Fzα to lyse corpora lutea and cause myometrial
contraction.
Drug(s) of Choice
Antibiotics
■  Empirical, pending results of bacterial culture and sensitivity test
■ Use in all patients with pyometra
■ Common choice is enrofloxacin (5-10 mg/kg PO every 24 hours)
■ Administration continued for 3 to 4 weeks
Prostaglandins PG F2a
■ Doses listed below for native compound only; analogues not recommended
■ Cats: 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg SQ every 8 to 12 hours for 2 to 5 days until the size of the
uterus nears normal
■Dogs: 0.05 to 0.25 mg/kg SQ every 8 to 12 hours for 3 to 7 days until no intrauterine
fluid visible by ultrasound
■ Less conventional protocols also exist for lower doses given five times daily
(10μg/kg five times a day for 1 day, then 20μg/kg five times daily for 1 day and then
50μg/kg five times daily).
PYOMETRA
653
Cloprostenol
■ Dogs: 1 μg/kg SQ daily for 7 to 14 days
Miscellaneous
■Aglepristone (10 mg/kg SQ days 1, 2, and 8) efficacy enhanced with concurrent treat-
ment with prostaglandin; not available in United States
 Cabergoline (5μg/kg PO daily for 7 to 14 days) used currently with prostaglandin
to increase speed of luteolysis and cervical opening
 Misoprostol 1 to 3μg/kg given intravaginally concurrently with prostaglandin F2α to
assist in opening cervix if needed
Precautions/Interactions
■ PGFzα and cloprostenol with closed-cervix pyometra cause strong myometrial
contractions.
 May cause uterine rupture or force purulent exudate through the oviducts, causing
secondary peritonitis
■ PGFzα and cloprostenol in a valuable breeding animal; always rule out pregnancy
before administration.
■ PGFzα and cloprostenol not approved for use in dogs and cats
Adverse effects of prostaglandins--referable to contraction of smooth muscle; include
hypersalivation; emesis; defecation; intense grooming of the flanks and vulva (cats);
 appear within minutes of injection; subside within 30 to 60 minutes; severity dimin-
ishes throughout the treatment regimen; may be diminished by diluting the drug
with an equal volume of sterile saline before subcutaneous injection and by walking
dogs for 20 to 30 minutes after injection, antiemetics can also be utilized
Diet
 Timing of feeding should avoid the hour before and the hour after PGFzα administra-
tion to prevent vomiting of meal.
Activity
■Patients with pyometra typically are not interested in exercise and should be allowed
to rest, apart from the walking post PGFzα administration.
Surgical Considerations
■  Pyometra (open and  closed  cervix)—ovariohysterectomy preferred  treatment;
chronic progressive disease (Figure 85.2)
■ Closed-cervix pyometra—use caution during ovariohysterectomy, enlarged uterus
may be friable and prone to rupture.

exogenous heat support and monitoring of body temperature are important.
COMMENT
Client Education
 Inform client that ovariohysterectomy is the preferred treatment.
■ Recommend medical treatment only for valuable breeding animals that are not azo-
temic and have an open cervix, warn client that except when breeding is planned.
non-progestational, estrus-suppressing drugs (mibolerone) should be given for life.
■Warn client that medical treatment of closed-cervix pyometra can be associated with
uterine rupture and peritonitis.
■  Inform client that medical treatment does not cure underlying cystic endometrial
hyperplasia in patients with either open- or closed-cervix pyometra but may enable
some affected bitches and queens to reproduce.
■ Patients treated medically can cycle sooner than expected due to shortening of the
luteal phase of the cycle.
Patient Monitoring
■Medically treated patients should be monitored with ultrasound to gauge their prog-
ress, initially after 3 to 5 days of treatment, then every 2 days until resolution.
PYOMETRA
■ After discharge, patients should be rechecked in 2 weeks for any vaginal discharge
and overall health; ultrasound can be rechecked at this time.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Patient should be bred on next cycle and spayed after desired litter(s).
■If breeding is not planned, cycle should be suppressed in the bitch (no safe alterna-
tives for this in the queen).
Possible Complications
■Infertility
■ Uterine rupture
■Bitch may enter estrus sooner after treatment than anticipated if medical treatment
induced premature luteolysis.

Pyothorax
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Pyothorax is characterized by the accumulation of a septic purulent fluid within the
pleural space.
Pyothorax occurs in both dogs and cats, but occurs more commonly in cats
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 The most common cause of pyothorax in cats is bite wounds to the chest from other
cats, but environmental contamination from penetrating thoracic injuries can also
occur. Additional causes include rupture or perforation of the esophagus, trachea,
or bronchi, migrating foreign bodies (grass awns) or lung parasites, bacterial pneu-
monia leading to lung abscesses and rupture, or iatrogenic contamination from
thoracocentesis or thoracotomy.
1 In dogs, pyothorax may result from penetrating wounds to the chest, neck, or medi-
astinum, esophageal perforations, lung parasites, bacterial pneumonia with absces-
sation and rupture, hematogenous or lymphatic spread from other septic foci, spread
from cervical, lumbar, or sternal diskospondylitis, neoplasia with secondary absces-
sation, iatrogenic contamination from thoracocentesis or thoracotomy and migrating
foreign bodies such as grass awns.
The most common bacterial isolates from cats with pyothorax are the anaerobes
aerobes Pasteurella spp and Actinomyces spp.
■ The most common bacterial isolates from dogs are the anaerobes Peptostreptococcus
spp, Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, and Porphyromonas spp, and the aerobes
Actinomyces spp, Pasteurella spp, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus spp. These bacte-
rial isolates are similar to those identified from cats with the addition of the enteric.
E. coli.
 Mixed populations of bacteria are often cultured from cats and dogs.
Once bacterial infection enters the pleural cavity, the release of inflammatory media
tors causes increased permeability of the endothelial lining of the pleural capillaries
and impairment of lymphatic outflow. This results in accumulation of fluid, protein.
and inflammatory cells in the pleural space. Increased protein concentration in the

including hypoalbuminemia, hypoglycemia and increased ALT and total bilirubin.
Changes consistent with dehydration and hemoconcentration are seen in some
patients.
Other Laboratory Tests
 Retrovirus testing (cats)—FeLV or FIV positive status may complicate treatment and
increase risk of recurrence.
Imaging
■ Thoracic radiography—useful in confirming the presence of pleural effusion, but
patients in respiratory distress may not tolerate radiographs. More helpful in search-
ing for underlying causes once pleural effusion has been removed. Useful to deter-
mine if disease is bilateral or unilateral (Figures 86.1 and 86.2).
 Thoracic ultrasonography—can identify abscesses or masses in pulmonary paren-
chyma or mediastinum.
 Thoracoscopy—can be used to explore thoracic cavity. May be helpful in some cases
to flush thoracic cavity, determine cause, and remove affected lung lobes.
Diagnostic Procedures
■ Thoracocentesis—indicated if there is a suspicion of pleural effusion. It is often a
thick, opaque and foul-smelling fluid and may be flocculent. Samples should be
evaluated through cytology, culture, and cell counts.
■ Fluid analysis-exudate, protein > 3g/dl, nucleated cell count > 7 × 10°/l.
 Cytologyneutrophils, often degenerative with signs of toxicity and bacteria, both
intracellular and extracellular. Absence of bacteria does not rule out pyothorax.
especially if antibiotics have been administered. Sulfur granules may also be seen. If
the pyothorax is chronic, there may be increasing numbers of macrophages and
plasma cells.
■Aerobic and anaerobic culture and sensitivity testing.
■Fungal culture depending on geographic location.

 Pathological Findings
■ Pleuritis, pleuropneumonia, or pneumonia.
■ Underlying etiology including lung lobe abscesses, puncture wounds into thoracic
cavity, or foreign bodies may occasionally be seen.
THERAPEUTICS
■Initial stabilization-
Oxygen therapy, minimal handling and stress, thoracocentesis,
intravenous catheter and intravenous fluids, including shock boluses if indicated.
 Thoracic drainage—mainstay of therapy. Can be accomplished by intermittent tho-
racocentesis or by placement of thoracostomy tubes, with intermittent aspiration or
continuous drainage. Thoracostomy tubes are preferred because they allow for more
complete drainage of the thoracic cavity. Bilateral thoracostomy tubes are preferred
unless effusion is unilateral (Figure 86.3).
 Lavage of the thoracic cavity with warm physiological saline or other balanced elec-
trolyte solutions at 20 ml/kg. instilled over 10 to 15 minutes, every 6 to 24 hours
have been recommended. Not recommended unless effusion is too thick to aspirate
through chest tube due to risk of nosocomial infection and potential inability to
retrieve fluid.
 Figure 86.3 Cat with a chest tube in place to allow for frequent intermittent drainage of pleural effusion
from a pyothorax.
Drug(s) of choice
Antimicrobials
 Broad-spectrum antimicrobials—Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic cov-
erage until culture and sensitivity results are available. Broad-spectrum is essential
due to frequency of infection with mixed bacterial population.
■  Administer parenteral antibiotics while patient is critical and then switch to oral once
stabilized.
■  Adjust antibiotic therapy once culture and sensitivity results are available.
■Continue for several months following discharge from the hospital.
■  Fluid therapy—-maintenance rates or higher if pleural effusion is still being produced
Essential to keep patient hydrated so effusion can be aspirated via thoracostomy
tubes or thoracocentesis.
■ Clindamycin 1l mg/kg IV every 8 to 12 hours and enrofloxacin 10 to 15mg/kg IV
every 24 hours are excellent initial choices for dogs.
■ Clindamycin 1l mg/kg IV every 8 to 12 hours and cefotaxime 15 mg/kg IV every 6
hours initially for cats.
  Long-term antibiotic therapy depends on culture and sensitivity testing but potenti-
ated penicillins such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 22 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours are
often effective.
Analgesics
■ Should be administered post-thoracostomy tube placement and while tubes are in
place or post-thoracotomy.
  Intrapleural bupivicaine (1.5 mg/kg every 68 hours) via the thoracostomy tube may
provide some analgesia, often not sufficient alone.
■ Opiates such as hydromorphone 0.1 to 0.2mg/kg IV or IM every 4 to 6 hours or
fentanyl CRI 2 to 5μg/kg per hour are often effective.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Care with choice of antibiotics, aminoglycosides may cause acute renal failure, espe-
cially in patients that are not properly hydrated prior to initiating them. Potentiated
sulfas may cause KCs, ITP, polyarthropathy, and other immune-mediated disease.
Activity
■ Light activity (short walks) while hospitalized should be encouraged to prevent
atalectesis.
■  Restriction of activity to moderate level when discharged from hospital until resolu-
tion of radiographic signs.
Surgical Considerations
Cats
■  Medical treatment is usually successful.

Surgical Treatment
■ Requires a complete exploratory thoracotomy to identify and remove any necrotic
tissue or foreign material, as well as complete lavage of the thoracic cavity (Figure
86.4).
 Samples for aerobic and anaerobic culture can be obtained at surgery.
 Options include median or sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy. Median sternotomy
is preferred because it allows for full evaluation of the right and left hemithoraces.
Postoperative Care
■ Patients require intensive care and monitoring, especially for the first 24 to 48 hours
after surgery.
■Septic shock and SIRS may develop.
664 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Fluid therapy in the postoperative phase is very important and often consists of
crystalloids, colloids, and blood products.
■ Vasopressors may be needed to treat refractory hypotension once volume expansion
has been accomplished.
■ Respiratory, acid-base, and electrolyte abnormalities should be evaluated and treated,
as needed.
■ Patients are at risk for the development of DlC and need to have their coagulation
parameters monitored closely.
■ Daily evaluation of the CBC and cytology of the pleural effusion.
COMMENTS
Client Education
 Clients must be prepared for cost of treatment and long-term follow-up care.
Patient Monitoring
  In hospital—requires intensive care monitoring including respiratory rate/effort,

ment, nutrition monitoring, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.
■ CBC and thoracic radiographs should be monitored every few days initially, then at
increasing intervals.
■ Once discharged, recheck examinations every few weeks for CBC and thoracic radio-
graphs. Antibiotics should be continued until several weeks after resolution of radio-
 graphic changes.
Prevention/Avoidance
■Cats from single cat households have reduced risk.
■Dogs should avoid hunting if possible.
Possible Complications
■ Sepsis, septic shock, SIRS, death
■
 Recurrence of pyothorax, especially in dogs treated medically
■ Complications from thoracostomy tube including pneumothorax, hemothorax, or
nosocomial infection
■Fibrosing pleuritis (uncommon)
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ With appropriate therapy (antibiotics and medical or surgical management depend-
ing on species). prognosis is fair to good
■ Outpatient therapy with antibiotics and intermittent thoracocentesis has a poor
prognosis.

Retinal Detachment
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Separation of the retina from the underlying choroid.
Anatomically, the separation of the photoreceptor layer from the retinal pigment
epithelial layer of the retina.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 There are five main types of retinal detachments:
Serous detachments (Figure 88.l)
Accumulation of exudates or blood under the retina (Figure 88.2)
■Exudate is due to infectious causes (i.e., viral, fungal, or protozoal)
■ Hemorrhage is caused by systemic hypertension (a very common cause
in cats), coagulopathies, trauma or idiopathic (steroid-responsive retinal
detachment).
 Traction band detachments
 Fibrous bands attaching the vitreous to the retina contract and pull retina off;
secondary to uveitis or trauma.
Vitreous degeneration
Liquifaction of the vitreous secondary to aging or chronic inflammation allows
the vitreous to seep under the retina.
Congenital
 Not a true detachment but failure of the embryologic layers to unite; seen in
collie eye anomaly, retinal dysplasia (Figure 88.3)
latrogenic
After cataract surgery
Systems Affected
■ Ophthalmic
675
Figure 88.1 Fundic photograph of a dorsal, serous, retinal detachment. Note the veil-ike structure covering
the tapetum. This is the detached retina.
 Figure 88.2 Photograph of a detached retina taken through the pupil. Note the blood vessels in the retina
andthehemorrhages.
676
RETINAL DETACHMENT
677
 Figure 88.3 Fundic photograph of a circumscribed area of retinal detachment (white arrow) due to retinal
dysplasia. The worm-like areas are dysplastic retina (retinar fofos).
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ No breed or sex predilections
Risk Factors/Causes
 Dogs undergoing cataract surgery are at a higher risk and therefore those breeds
predisposed to cataracts are at risk.
Historical Factors
Vision loss-if unilateral may be difficult for owner to discern.
 Owner may notice cloudiness or redness of affected eye or the presence of a floating
white tissue in pupil.
678
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Acute vision loss—if detachments are incomplete, visual field losses may be present
and are very difficult to detect.
■ A white sheet of tissue may be visible through the pupil, behind the lens sheet; it
may contain blood vessels and possibly areas of hemorrhage.
■ Pupil may be dilated and unresponsive if bilateral detachment
  If unilateral, mild mydriasis in affected eye is present due to presence of consen-
sual light response from other eye.
  Direct pupillary light response in affected eye is absent.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Any disease that causes acute blindness (e.g., SARD, acute hyphema or vitreal hem-
orrhage, diabetic cataracts.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Ophthalmoscopy—direct visualization of the detached retina
■ Ocular ultrasound—if the posterior part of the eye cannot be seen due to cataracts
 or intraocular hemorrhage
■ Complete blood count: To rule out infection or bleeding disorder; serum chemistry
profile to assess renal function
 Systemic blood pressure measurement: To detect hypertension (especially important
in cats)
■Cardiac evaluation for cardiomyopathy
THERAPEUTICS
1 To optimize the environment for retinal reattachment; reattachment is not possible
in congenital detachment.
Drug(s) of Choice
     e - d   
to 1.25 mg orally once to twice daily per cat).
■ Appropriate systemic antimicrobials if infectious disease is suspected.
 Systemic corticosteroids can be administered if steroid-responsive retinal detach-
ment is suspected; contraindicated in infectious diseases.
RETINAL DETACHMENT
679
Precautions/Interactions
 Systemic corticosteroids are contraindicated if infectious disease is suspected.
■Corticosteroids should not be given in conjunction with NSAIDs.
Diet
■ No special diet is needed except if systemic hypertension is causative.
Surgical Considerations
 Retinal reattachment surgery, done by some veterinary ophthalmologists
 Partial detachments may be prevented from progressing by laser retinopexy around
the edges of the detachment.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ The patient should be kept quiet with minimal activity or excitement.
■]
 Because the animal usually goes blind he or she may become confused.
■
Patient Monitoring
 Frequent rechecks are recommended early in the disease (e.g., weekly); in cases of
hypertension, blood pressure should be checked and medications adjusted
accordingly.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Early detection of hypertension (e.g., monitoring blood pressure in older cats) can
prevent retinal detachment.
 Discourage breeding of dogs affected with CEA or retinal dysplasia to prevent genetic
transmission.
Possible Complications
■Permanent blindness
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Guarded prognosis; reattached retinas can regenerate depending on cause and dura-
tion of detachment
■ Better prognosis if detachment is due to serous subretinal exudate secondary to
hypertension

Scleral and Corneal
Lacerations
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Corneal or scleral lacerations are the result of disruption of the corneal or scleral
tissue, by blunt or sharp trauma, or by the presence of a foreign body.
 They may be partial or full thickness in nature, and they may or may not involve
other intraocular tissues or structures, such as the anterior or posterior vea, lens.
vitreous, or retina.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Sharp trauma leads to partial or full-thickness disruption of the sclera or cornea and
is initiated at the surface of the globe.
1 Blunt trauma usually leads to sudden, more severe damage to the intraocular struc-
tures, and can lead to blow-out type wounds to the sclera or cornea.
Systems Affected
Ophthalmic—There may be little to no scarring of the sclera or cornea that would
have no significant impact on vision, or the trauma may lead to glaucoma or phthisis
bulbi and therefore blindness if the intraocular structures are significantly involved
Collateral damage to the eyelids and the nictitating membrane may also need to be
addressed.
■Musculoskeletal—Depending on the degree of the trauma, orbital or skull bones may
be damaged, along with extraocular and other nearby muscles. Extraocular muscle
damage may lead to strabismus.
Nervous-Innervation of the cornea, eyelids, iris, extraocular muscles, and lacrimal
gland, function of the optic nerve, its radiations, and the visual cortex of the brain
may be affected.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 Dogs or cats, no age, breed or sex predilection.
685

BLAC KWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Highly excitable animals
Spending time in heavy, dry vegetation
Fighting
■ Facial nerve paresis/paralysis
■ Lagophthalmos
■Exophthalmos
Historical Findings
■Acute onset
 Possibly in heavy or dry vegetation
 Possibly hit by projectile (rock, pellet, etc.)
 Possibly in altercation with a cat
■
 Trauma often not observed
CLINICAL FEATURES
■Variable
Scleral wound may not be visible beneath abnormal conjunctiva (i.e., chemosis.
hyperemia, or subconjunctival hemorrhage).
 Uveal tissue may be prolapsed through wound.
Foreign body may or may not be present.
 Corneal edema, dyscoria, hyphema, cataract, vitreal hemorrhage, retinal detachment,
or exophthalmia may be present.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Identification of wound is diagnostic. If no wound is found, then one must consider
traumatic incident without laceration.
■ Sometimes underlying disease seems to become apparent to the owner “overnight,"
when disease has been present for weeks or months but has not been identifiable
until now. Occasionally infectious disease, immune-mediated disease or neoplasia
will present in this manner.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Identify tissues involved and possible cause and nature of damage to the eye.
■Be very careful to not put pressure on the globe until rupture or laceration has been
ruled out.
SCLERAL AND CORNEAL LACERATIONS687
■ Perform as complete an ophthalmic examination as possible, including Seidel test
when indicated. Be sure to examine periocular skin and orbit.
■ Consider scleral rupture when subconjunctival hemorrhage is present, shallow or
deep anterior chamber is present, vitreal hemorrhage is present, or the globe is very
soft.
■ Blood work and urinalysis are usually not helpful if just the eye is affected. These
should be considered if general anesthesia is required, or if another underlying
disease process is suspected.
 Consider coagulation profile if bleeding cannot be explained due to trauma
■ Imaging such as ocular ultrasound, orbital radiographs, CT or MRl should be con-
sidered to ascertain extent of damage and possibly identify foreign body.
Pathologic Findings
■ Depend on extent of ocular damage
■  Posttraumatic sarcoma occurs in cats. May be months or years after initial trauma.
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of choice
 Note: medications that would otherwise be impervious to the eye due to blood-eye
barriers will likely enter the acutely inflamed eye. Inflammation reduces the effective-
ness of these barriers and allows larger molecules to leave the bloodstream.
Antibiotics
(neomycin and polymyxin B and bacitracin, or tobramycin) are usually adequate.
  Perforating wounds with negative Seidel test: systemic antibiotics (dogs, enrofloxacin
10 to 20mg/kg PO once daily, cephalexin 11 to 22mg/kg three times daily: cats,
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 13.75 mg/kg twice daily); topical antibiotics (for good
penetration, fluoroquinolones such as ofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or moxifloxacin) 1 gtt
every l to 6 hours.
■  Perforating wounds with positive Seidel test: same as for perforating wounds with
negative Seidel test, only after wound has been sealed.
Anti-Inflammatories
■ If no infection is present, topical prednisolone acetate 1% or 0.1% dexamethasone
suspensions every 6 to 12 hours; systemic prednisone 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg once to twice
daily.
carprofen 2.2 mg/kg PO twice daily or firocoxib 5 mg/kg PO every 24 hours)
there is significant risk of vision loss if present inflammation is not controlled
Mydriatics
■ Atropine 1% ophthalmic solution every 6 to 12 hours when there is significant
miosis or aqueous flare. Frequency may be decreased as long as pupil remains
dilated.
Analgesics
■  Topical atropine—see previous information
■ Systemic anti-inflammatories—see previous information
 Butorphanol—dogs, 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg: cats, 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV, SQ, or IM every 2 to
4 hours or as needed for mild pain.
■ Oxymorphone-dogs, 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg: cats, 0.05 mg/kg IV, SQ, or IM every 4 to
6 hours or as needed for severe pain where sedation is required.
■Naloxone—0.04 mg/kg IV, SQ, or IM to reverse narcotics.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Avoid ophthalmic cintments in cases where perforation has occurred. If cintment
gets inside the eye, it will likely lead to granulomatous inflammation.
■ Avoid systemic enrofloxacin and orbifloxacin in young dogs, risk of disruption of
cartilage synthesis.
 Enrofloxacin in cats may lead to acute retinal degeneration and vision loss.
■Aminoglycosides—if used frequently or at high concentrations they may be irritating
and may impede re-epithelialization; may need to carefully calculate dose in very
small animals, especially if giving this kind of drug systemically as well.
■  Topical steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories may delay wound healing.
 Atropine may exacerbate KCS and glaucoma.
■Safety of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories in cats has not been determined.
■ Systemic NSAIDs may potentiate nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides; be sure animal
Alternative Drugs
■ Compounding fortified and noncommercial topical antibiotic solutions is possible
with cefazolin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and others. More aggressive therapy is
achieved by increasing the concentration in some of these solutions.
Activity
 Should be confined to indoors or small, well controlled environment. Cats should
remain indoors. Leash walking usually okay. Consider using a harness to keep pres-
sure off neck and avoid increasing intraocular pressure.

COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Warn owners that full extent of ocular damage (i.e., cataracts, lens capsule rupture,
retinal detachment, glaucoma, or infection) may not be apparent for days or weeks
after initial injury.
■ With ocular disease, prognosis for vision and prognosis for keeping the globe and
remaining comfortable must both be discussed.
Patient Monitoring
■ Deep or perforating wound should be checked every 24 to 48 hours to monitor for
infection, control of inflammation, and structural integrity of the globe.
 Superficial wounds should be rechecked every 3 to 5 days until adequate healing has
occurred.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Dogs that like to venture into thick vegetation, especially those that are low to the
ground, and especially those with significant ocular exposure (i.e., brachiocephalic
breeds) are at more risk of injury. Dogs with vision impairment or blind dogs should
be monitored in these conditions as well.
Possible Complications
■Loss of vision
■Posttraumatic sarcoma in cats
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Most corneal lacerations and foreign bodies can be successfully treated.
■ Injuries that have a poorer prognosis are those with posterior uveal involvement,
lack of light perception in the injured eye, lens involvement, moderate-to-severe
vitreal hemorrhage, or retinal detachment.
■ An eye that sustains blunt trauma usually has a poorer prognosis than one that
experiences sharp trauma.

Seizures
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A seizure is a nonvolitional, unregulated, rhythmic, repetitive excitatory discharge
of neurons in the cerebral cortex.
 Seizures can be focal or generalized, convulsive, or nonconvulsive (i.e., lacking gross
movement).
■ Focal seizures may manifest themselves as repetitive, uncontrolled tonic-clonic
movement of a single area of the body such as the jaw or a single limb.
cortex become excited.
Generalized seizures usually are characterized by tonic-clonic movement of the entire
body.
The term cluster seizures refers to more than two seizures in a 24-hour period.
of seizure activity with incomplete recovery.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Seizures may result from extracranial (reactive) and intracranial (symptomatic)
etiologies.
1  Extracranial causes of seizures are systemic disorders that result in the exposure of
brain cells to epileptogenic substances or conditions.
 Extracranial etiologies include: toxins, electrolyte imbalances (i.e., hypocalcemia,
uremic encephalopathy hepatic encephalopathy energy deprivation, and
endocrinopathy.
Intracranial causes of seizures result from structural derangement of the cerebral
cortex.
  Intracranial etiologies include: tumors (primary or metastatic), encephalitis (infec-
tious and non-infectious), malformations (e.g., hydrocephalus), degenerative
 brain disease, vascular disorders, and idiopathic epilepsy.
Systems Affected
 Cardiovascular—possible arrhythmias.
69
Endocrine/Metabolic—lactic acidosis, dehydration, hyperthermia.
■Nervous
■  Respiratory—neurogenic pulmonary edema, possible respiratory distress or airway
obstruction during seizure event.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Age, sex, and breed predisposition will vary according to the underlying etiology
that leads to seizures.
 m so o  s  a   e   
pathic epilepsy.
 Idiopathic epilepsy is poorly characterized in cats.
 Idiopathic epilepsy appears to be a heritable disease in breeds such as the Labrador
retriever, German shepherd, Vizla, Finnish Spitz, and Dachshund.
■ Small breed dogs, especially those with dome shaped heads, are frequently affected
by malformations like hydrocephalus or Chiari-like malformation that may result in
seizures.
 Older dogs and cats are more likely than younger animals to have intracranial neopla-
sia; some tumor types, such as meningioma, may have breed and sex predilections.
■ Animals of any age and breed can be affected by toxins, metabolic disorders, organ
dysfunction, and encephalitis
■ Seizures (the ictus) are usually typified by: a loss of consciousness, body/limb con-
vulsions, and autonomic activity (i.e., tachycardia, salivation, urination,
defecation).
■ Animals that have seizures may have preictal behavioral changes, sometimes called
an atra.
■  Postictal neurological signs are exceedingly common regardless of etiology and may
include blindness, mentation changes, and ataxia; typically, postictal deficits will
resolve within hours or a few days and will very likely be symmetrical if the underly-
ing etiology is extracranial.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Risk factors are dependent on the etiology leading to seizure activity.
■  In general, animals with structural disease involving the forebrain are predisposed
to developing seizures.
■ Extracranial seizures may be precipitated by exposure to toxins, medications, sys-
temic diseases of the liver and kidney, as well as diseases that alter electrolytes (e.g..
Addison's disease) or result in hypoglycemia (e.g., insulinoma).
Historical Findings
 Owners may report an aura; the animal may hide, whine, seek attention, or appear
restless prior to the ictus.
SEIZURES695
 During the postictal period, the animal may appear blind, walk into walls, circle.
show ataxia, be non-ambulatory, or have mentation changes.
  The animal should lose consciousness during a generalized seizure and be unrespon-
sive to the owner. Tonic-clonic movements are commonly noted.
 The owner may report finding feces and urine in the house that were produced
during an unrecognized seizure event.
CLINICAL FEATURES
  Animals may have completely normal physical examinations or may show abnormali-
ties that refect underlying systemic disease, recent seizure activity (e.g., postictal
signs, hyperthermia) or neurologic examination findings suggesting structural
disease.
 Abnormal neurologic examination findings include altered mentation, obtundation
or coma, evidence of cortical blindness, circling, and postural reaction deficits.
 The neurologic examination abnormalities may disappear with time if they are post-
ictal or remain if they are a result of structural intracranial disease.
 Postictal deficits are typically symmetrical if the underlying etiology is not structural
derangement of the central nervous system.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Syncope—Syncope is defined as a loss of consciousness secondary to lack of adequate
blood flow to the brain, which is usually sudden in onset and of short duration.
 Syncopal episodes usually are preceded by excitement or exercise and can range
in severity from rear limb weakness to total collapse
 Recovery from syncopal episodes is usually rapid with no lingering deficits.
 Animals suspected of syncope should have a complete cardiac evaluation.
 Narcolepsy is characterized by sudden onset REM sleep, cataplexy, sleep hallucina-
tions, excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep paralysis
■  Episodes are usually preceded by an excitatory stimulus such as feeding or seeing
an intact member of the opposite sex.
■ The Labrador retriever and Doberman pinscher are predisposed and have an
autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.
■ Acute fulminant neuromuscular diseases, such as myasthenia gravis and congenital
myotonia, may be mistaken for seizures.
■ Owners may describe the collapse and weakness associated with myasthenia gravis
as a seizure.
■Animals with congenital myotonia will demonstrate a sudden onset of generalized
spasticity and collapse, with resolution after a few minutes.
696  BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Acute vestibular attack—Vestibular diseases (especially those that are idiopathic or
vascular) can have a sudden onset of clinical signs
 Affected animals may roll around and be unable to rise, which may be mistaken
for a seizure.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ A CBC, chemistry panel with electrolytes, coagulation profle, and urinalysis should
 be performed on all animals with seizures.
■F
 Bile acid testing or a random ammonia level may be helpful in animals suspected of
having liver disease based on clinical signs, signalment, or chemistry values (i.e., low
albumin, low cholesterol, low BUN, low glucose, abnormal liver enzymes).
■If the animal is currently on anti-epileptic medications, serum should be drawn for
blood drug levels prior to administration of AEDs other than diazepam.
■ Blood pressure monitoring and pulse oximetry are encouraged, especially in animals
■ Imaging and CsF examination should always be recommended for seizuring animals
without an etiologic diagnosis, unless there is clear evidence for a metabolic or toxic
cause for seizures
■ MRI is the preferred imaging modality, although CT can also be helpful because
many forebrain lesions would be visible, even as subtle changes.
■ As long as there is no evidence of increased intracranial pressure (i.e., severe midline
shift, brain herniation, obstructive hydrocephalus) or definitive neoplastic lesions on
imaging. CSF collection can be performed.
Pathological Findings
1Gross and histopathologic findings will vary based on the cause of the seizures.
  Prolonged seizures of any cause can result in edema and neuronal necrosis, especially
in the hippocampus and temporal lobes.
THERAPEUTICS
future seizure activity.
■A rapid acting AED should be administered to all patients actively having a seizure
at the time of admission.
■ If serum biochemistry suggests an underlying metabolic etiology such as hypoglyce-
mia or hypocalcemia, this should be corrected. Treatment of an animal with main-
tenance AEDs should be pursued if the patient presents in status epilepticus or has
at least two seizures in a 24-hour period.
■  If seizures resulted from intoxication or metabolic disease that is resolved, mainte-
nance AEDs can be tapered over a few weeks.
SEIZURES697
1 Animals with structural intracranial disease, idiopathic epilepsy or unresolved meta-
bolic disease will need to be continued on a maintenance AED, unless the underlying
cause of seizures can be definitively treated
Drug(s) of choice
Emergency
■ Patients that are actively seizuring should receive an intravenous bolus of diazepam
at a dose of 0.5mg/kg if they are not on AEDs and lmg/kg if they are currently
receiving AEDs that are p450 inducers, such as phenobarbital.
■ These doses are doubled for rectal administration in cases where intravenous access
is not immediately available.
■ Midazolam can be used as an alternative to diazepam.
AED treatment.
 pp q u p pas p x i s od ia y
■]
 Propofol or other rapid acting AEDs may need to be used while waiting for pheno-
barbital to take effect.
 Recently, newer AEDs, such as levetiracetam, have become available as intravenous
preparations and are likely safe alternative in dogs and cats.
■The following is a brief list of emergency drugs.
Diazepam
■ Mechanism: GABA receptor agonist (hepatic elimination).
Adverse effects: Sedation, excitement, hepatopathy (cats after oral use).
 Dosage: 0.5 mg/kg (l mg/kg in animals on phenobarbital) IV as a bolus; CRI 0.2 to
2 mg/kg per hour (0.2-0.5 mg/kg per hour typical starting range); rectal (double
intravenous bolus dosage).
 Animals on a diazepam CRl or receiving boluses without correctable metabolic dis-
turbances will need a maintenance drug to prevent seizure activity.
■ Animals on a diazepam CRI will need to be weaned off.
Midazolam
Mechanism and adverse effects: similar to diazepam
 Dosage: 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg IV, IM, SQ
Phenobarbital
■ Mechanism: GABA receptor agonist with 24- to 72-hour half-life (hepatic
elimination).
■ Adverse effects: Polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, behavioral alteration, hepatopathy
(especially at blood level >35-40μg/mL), bone marrow dyscrasia (usually within 1
month of initiating therapy)、 dermatopathy movement disorders, low thyroid
hormone levels.
  n     n s  s
■ Dosage: Load at 12 to 16 mg/kg.
■  In relatively stable animals 6 mg/kg intravenous bolus is followed by the remainder
of the load divided over 24 hours
■ May take up to 20 minutes for full effect IV, so other drugs may need to be used
while an animal that is actively convulsing is being loaded.
■  In cases of intractable seizures up to 30mg/kg can be administered in a day with
single bolus loads up to 16 mg/kg.
Alternative Drugs
Propofo!
 Mechanism: Novel hypnotic (hepatic and systemic microsomal elimination).
■
Adverse effects: Sedation, cardiopulmonary depression, hypotension, Heinz body
formation (cats with sustained exposure).
■ Dosage: 2 to 8mg/kg bolus; CR1 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg per minute.
Pentobarbita!
■Dose of 1 to 3 mg/kg bolus followed by repeated boluses or 3 to 10 mg/kg per hour
CRI.
■ Although pentobarbital may reduce convulsive activity some authors have ques-
tioned its ability to inhibit the neuronal fring associated with seizures.
■Pentobarbital is not recommended by the authors of this chapter.
OtherAlternatives
■ Levetiracetam is an effective AED and is available in an intravenous preparation.
■ Anesthesia may also be induced and maintained on isoflourane or with a propofol
or phenobarbital CRI.
■ These animals will require intubation and will need ventilatory support.
Maintenance Therapy
  Although many authors consider traditional drugs such as phenobarbital and potas-
sium bromide as the “drugs of choice," other authors prefer costlier, newer drugs
that have fewer reported side effects, less rigorous monitoring requirements, and
likely have equal or greater efficacy compared to traditional options.
 Potassium bromide is not an acceptable maintenance AED in cats because of adverse
pulmonary effects.
■ Diazepam has been used as a maintenance drug in cats, although most authors dis-
courage this because severe, irreversible hepatopathy has been described.
■Some animals will not be controlled with single maintenance AEDs and may require
bi- or trimodal therapy.
■ For traditional drugs please make certain that blood drug levels are in appropriate
range before adding additional medications.
 Some newer drugs are dosed to effect
SEIZURES
669
Newer Drugs
Zonisamide (Zonegran)
■ Mechanism: Blockade of calcium and sodium channels; enhanced GABA release. It
has a 15-hour half-life.
■ Hepatic metabolism
■Adverse effects: Ataxia, vomiting, lethargy keratoconjunctivitis sicca
■ Follow up: CBC and biochemistry every 6 months
■ Zonisamide blood levels are not widely available.
■]
Dosage: 4 to 10 mg/kg PO twice a day in dogs
■ If this drug is being used in combination with drugs inducing hepatic microsomal
enzymes, the higher end of the dose range may be required
■Not suggested in cats
Levetiracetam (Keppra)
 Mechanism: Calcium and glycine channel blockade
■ Half-life of 4 hours in dog, although significant effect occurs during trough
 Urinary elimination with extrahepatic hydrolysis
■ Adverse effects: believed to be extremely safe
■
Ataxia, salivation, and gastrointestinal signs are seen with extremely high doses
■ Follow up: CBC and biochemistry are suggested every 6 months.
■  Levetiracetam levels are not widely available and are of questionable value
 Dosage: 20 mg/kg PO three times a day starting dose in dogs
 Can be increased in 10 to 20mg/kg increments
■
 Can be provided IV as a 20 mg/kg slow bolus
 Similar dosing has been attempted in cats.
Gabapentin (Neurontin)
 Mechanism: Increased synthetic GABA levels, calcium channel blockade
Renal (major route) and hepatic metabolism
■ Half-life is 3 to 4 hours in dog. although significant effect occurs during trough.
 Adverse effects: Mild ataxia and sedation
■  Follow up: Gabapentin levels are not widely available and are of questionable value
in human medicine.
Dosage: 30 to 60 mg/kg/day divided three to four times daily in dogs
■ 5 to 10 mg/kg PO two to three times daily in cats
■Do not use liquid gabapentin that contains xylitol.
Traditional Drugs
Phenobarbital
■ Follow up: Blood drug levels should be obtained 14 to 2l days after altering dosage
or if seizures are poorly controlled.
■ When starting dogs on phenobarbital, a CBC, biochemistry, and bile acid test are
suggested.
■ Rechecking chemistry panels, phenobarbital levels, and bile acid values every 6
months is suggested.
■ Dosage: Starting dose 2 to 3 mg/kg PO twice daily in dog with incremental adjust-
ment if seizures are poorly regulated.
and between 15 μg/ml and 30 μg/ml in most cats.
Potassium Bromide
■ Mechanism: GABA receptor agonist with 20- to 30-day half-life (renal
elimination).
Adverse effects: Polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, gastrointestinal disease, behavioral
alteration, pancreatitis, dermatopathy ataxia (especially pelvic limb), and false eleva-
tion of chloride on blood chemistry.
■ Contraindicated in cats due to potentially fatal pneumonitis, relatively contraindi-
cated in animals with nephropathy and cardiac disease.
■ Follow up: Blood drug levels are obtained 3 months after initiating therapy or chang-
ing therapy.
■ Chemistry, urinalysis, and blood bromide levels are suggested every 6 months to 1
year.
■ Diet change should be discouraged, if possible, as alteration in salt content can
change blood drug levels.
■ Dosage: Naive animals should be orally loaded at 100mg/kg every 24 hours for 5
days.
■ In emergency situations the total load can be given over one day and may be admin-
istered rectally, although gastrointestinal signs are frequent.
■ Maintenance dosing is 30 to 40 mg/kg PO every 24 hours.
■ When doses are increased, a partial load (100 mg/kg and new dose/day for 5 days)
is suggested.
■ Diuresis with 0.9% saline will rapidly lower blood levels
■ Therapeutic drug levels range between 1 and 3 mg/ml.
Precautions/Interactions
■ AEDs are complex drugs, and any precautions or interactions listed represent only
a small proportion of those possible.
■ In general, acepromazine has questionable pro-epileptogenic properties and some
 practitioners feel it should be used cautiously in dogs with seizures.
■ Drugs that lower the seizure threshold should be avoided if possible
■ Animals on phenobarbital may have altered or increased metabolism of other drugs
eliminated by the cytochrome p450 pathway in the liver.
SEIZURES
701
Diet
■ The animal's diet should not be changed without cause if the patient is receiving
potassium bromide as different salt content of food can affect drug absorption.
■Animals on potassium bromide should also have a drug level checked 2 to 3 months
after a change in the mineral composition of water.
  Diet may also affect blood phenobarbital level.
■ Ketogenic diets, while effective in juvenile humans to reduce seizure frequency, do
not work well in veterinary species.
Activity
■ No alterations in activity are suggested.
Surgical Considerations
■ Animals with central nervous system disease are at increased risk for anesthetic
complications.
■ Monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide, blood pressure, heart rate, and other param-
eters is recommended during anesthesia because brain herniation can be a sequela
of anesthesia; signs of this could include Cushing's reflex (hypertension with brady-
cardia), anisocoria, miosis, or unresponsive pupils.
■ Surgical therapy for certain structural central nervous system diseases can be
attempted.
■ Surgical resection of an epileptic focus is not typically performed in veterinary
medicine.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ Clients need to understand that treatment will be lifelong and will require monitor-
ing of the patient in animals with idiopathic epilepsy or underlying structural intra-
cranial disease.
■The client should be instructed to maintain a seizure diary for the patient.
 Regular dosing of the AED needs to be emphasized as well as the negative conse-
quences of sudden cessation of medication.
Patient Monitoring
■ While hospitalized, animals should be under near constant observation for seizure
activity.
■ Some facilities will attach bells to animals in an effort to help alert staff to a
seizure event.
 The frequency of seizures should be monitored by the owner; more than one seizure
per month indicates the need for blood drug levels or a change in drug dosage.
■ See other monitoring under specific AEDs.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Some owners report that certain activities can trigger seizures in their pets; these
activities should obviously be avoided if such a link is suspected.
Possible Complications
 Patients who are seemingly well-regulated for a period of time may develop break-
through seizure activity and need medication adjustments.
■  Prolonged seizures or cluster seizures can be life threatening because they may place
increased metabolic demands on the patient and interfere with energy delivery to
cells.
■Patients that have break through seizure activity that is untreated will likely be at
 risk for the expansion of their epileptic focus, which may make seizure control more
challenging.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ The course and prognosis associated with seizures are variable and depend on the
underlying etiology.
therapeutic monitoring can be daunting for some owners.
■ Some animals with idiopathic epilepsy will require therapy with multiple AEDs or
may have to be switched to more expensive medications as a result of side effects.
■ Animals with encephalitis have a variable prognosis ranging from guarded to excel-
lent depending on the etiology.

Serotonin Syndrome
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Serotonin syndrome is a complex of clinical signs resulting from overstimulation of
serotonin receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
1 In humans, serotonin syndrome is defined as a combination of symptoms that
includes at least three of the following: myoclonus, mental aberration (dementia,
disorientation, etc.). agitation, hyperreflexia, tremors, diarrhea, ataxia,
.or
hyperthermia.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Serotonin syndrome is caused by excessive stimulation of serotonin receptors. This
most commonly occurs in pets following inappropriate ingestion of pharmaceuticals.
Such pharmaceuticals can include drugs that enhance serotonin synthesis (i.e..
L-tryptophan, L-5-hydroxytryptophan), drugs that increase presynaptic serotonin
release (i.e., amphetamines and derivatives, MAOIs, cocaine), drugs that inhibit
serotonin uptake into the presynaptic neuron (i.e., SSRIs, TCAs, amphetamines,
cocaine, dextromethorphan, meperidine), drugs that inhibit serotonin metabolism
(i.e., MAOIs) and drugs that act as serotonin agonists (i.e., buspirone, sumatriptin,
LSD) (Table 92.1).
Systems Affected
 Gastrointestinal—increased smooth muscle contractility
Nervous-stimulation and altered mental status; increased autonomic function
■ Cardiovascular—decreased vascular tone, increased cardiac stroke rate and
volume
 Neuromuscular—autonomic dysfunction (hyperactivity)
 Respiratory—increased bronchial smooth muscle contraction

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Toxicologic differentials include metaldehyde, lead, antifreeze, hops, anticholinergic,
or antihistamine toxicosis.
 Other disease processes such as malignant hyperthermia, heat stroke, meningitis (i.e.
rabies, canine distemper, etc.) and neoplasia can cause similar CNS signs.
DIAGNOSTICS
 There are no diagnostic tests to confirm serotonin syndrome.
Diagnosis is based on history of ingestion of serotonergic drugs and presence of
appropriate clinical signs.
Testing for various pharmaceuticals can be performed, but due to the turnaround
time and lack of diagnostic levels in pets this is rarely done.
Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, CK, urinalysis, and blood gases; assess metabolic aci-
dosis and rhabdomyolysis.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Prevent development of signs or to decrease the severity of signs once they occur by
decreasing serotonin levels.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ Emesis (if asymptomatic and recent ingestion) or gastric lavage
Activated charcoal with cathartic (may need to repeat)
■Phenothiazines (acepromazine 0.025-0.05 mg/kg IV, titrate up as needed) or benz0-
diazepines (diazepam 0.5-2 mg/kg IV) can be used to control agitation.
■ Cyproheptadine (dog 1.1 mg/kg. cat 2-4 mg PO every 4-6 hours; may give rectally
if vomiting) is a nonselective serotonin antagonist.
Precautions/Interactions
■Contraindicated drugs (high risk of serotonin syndrome): amphetamines, SSRIs,
MAOls, TCAs, hydroxytryptophan, clarithromycin, dextromethorphan, lithium, St.
John's wort
■ Use with caution (low risk of serotonin syndrome): amantadine, bupropion, carba-
mazepine, codeine, and tramadol
■ Drug interactions: cimetidine (decreased metabolism of serotonergic drugs), class
1C antiarrhythmics (propafenone, flecainide [increased cardiac arrhythmias]), meto-
prolol (bradycardia, hypotension), quinidine (decreased metabolism of serotonergic
drugs), and theophylline (increased theophylline levels)

Shock-Cardiogenic
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Shock is defined as any condition that results in inadequate effective circulating
volume and oxygen delivery to the tissues. Shock has been broken down into several
classification categories. In any classification scheme, the underlying problem is that
the oxygen delivery is not sufficient to meet the oxygen needs of the tissues. This
leads to a cellular oxygen and energy debt. It is important to note that although there
may be one predominant category that a specific patient falls into, one must consider
all of the aspects of each of the categories when formulating a treatment plan. For
example, a patient with severe gastrointestinal disease and hemorrhagic diarrhea may
initially present in hypovolemic shock, but as the clinical disease progresses, the
gastrointestinal blood barrier may become compromised leading to bacterial trans-
location, systemic septicemia and septic shock. This can then go on to affect the
heart and lead to impaired myocardial contractility, thus exhibiting signs of cardio-
genic shock. So although the different categories of shock will be presented, care
 must be taken to approach each patient with an open mind and the realization that
the categories may overlap considerably
 Cardiogenic shock refers to impaired tissue perfusion secondary to decreased cardiac
output and diminished stroke volume.
 Distributive shock describes a condition of relative hypovolemia in which there is
massive vasodilation resulting in pooling of the circulating blood volume and
impaired tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Cardiogenic shock occurs secondary to anything that results in impaired cardiac
output and compromised tissue perfusion.
■ DCM is one of the most common causes of cardiac disease in large breed dogs.
■
ventricular dilation in an effort to maintain cardiac output.
 Tachyarrhythmias are common with DCM.
■ Impairs forward blood flow and results in decreased tissue perfusion.
■ DCM is currently one of the least common forms of heart disease in the cat but
can still be associated with taurine deficiency.

■ DCM in cats can also present as the final stages of hypertrophic or unclassified
cardiomyopathy.
in the cat.
■ In severe cases, the inability of the ventricle to adequately relax during diastole
leads to a decrease in cardiac output secondary to insufficient filling. The impaired
cardiac output, combined with the congestive heart failure that occurs secondary
to the poor relaxation, leads to significant decrease in oxygen delivery to the
tissues.
 Pericardial tamponade is a condition in which pressure is placed on the heart from
fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac
■ This pressure prevents the heart from filling appropriately during diastole, and a
subsequent decrease in cardiac output. This may occur secondary to hemangio-
sarcoma (most commonly affecting the right atrial appendage or right atrium),
heart base tumors, idiopathic or other neoplasia (lymphosarcoma, mesothelioma,
other), right atrial rupture due to chronic valvular disease, or trauma.
■ Patients with severe tachy- or bradyarrhythmias may not have adequate diastolic
filling time or appropriate heart rate to provide cardiac output, resulting in secondary
impaired perfusion of the tissues.
■ Severe ventricular outflow or inflow obstruction secondary to neoplasia, thrombus,
heartworm, anatomic abnormalities, stenosis, or granulomas.
  Infective endocarditis can result in significant valvular impairment, thrombus forma-
tion, or myocardial depression secondary to sepsis.
leads to decreased cardiac output and potentially congestive heart failure
■ The compensatory responses of the body in cases of impaired cardiac output include
tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system. These compensatory responses increase the work of the heart
and can further exacerbate the decrease in tissue perfusion.
Systems Affected
■ Cardiovascular—The primary or secondary cardiac disease associated with cardio-
genic shock is the cause of the impaired cardiac output. Decreased coronary blood
 flow further exacerbates the myocardial hypoperfusion and dysfunction and can lead
to myocardial ischemia, dysrhythmias, and thrombi formation.
■ Pulmonary—-Congestive heart failure and associated pulmonary edema are common
in patients with cardiogenic shock. This decrease in the ability of the patient
to oxygenate and subsequent hypoxia further amplify the decreased tissue
perfusion.
■ Renal—When the mean arterial blood pressure decreases below 60 mm Hg. the
kidneys are no longer able to autoregulate and hypotension directly impairs the blood
       a      
cardiac output, and when this is decreased the kidneys are extremely sensitive to

impaired perfusion. This decrease in perfusion may result in renal ischemia and acute
tubular necrosis, renal failure and oliguria.
■ Gastrointestinal—Impaired splanchnic perfusion, and decreased oxygen delivery
can result in significant damage to the mucosa, ulceration, the loss of the intestinal
blood barrier and subsequent bacterial translocation, intestinal necrosis, and
hemorrhage.
■ Hepatic—Decreased cardiac output results in decreased hepatic blood flow and
hepatic congestion. Can lead to hepatic ischemia and impaired hepatic function
ting factor production, decreased protein synthesis, and hyperbilirubinemia.
■ Nervous—Central nervous system dysfunction is a significant complication in
patients with inadequate oxygen delivery. Coagulation abnormalities associated with
cardiogenic shock can lead to vascular events (thrombosis or hemorrhage) that affect
the central nervous system. This can result in cerebral ischemia and associated mani-
festations such as stupor, blindness, and decreased spinal reflexes. The permanence
of these neurologic abnormalities is again related to the severity and duration of the
shock event.
■ Musculoskeletal—Musculoskeletal weakness is a common complication in patients
profound, and patients should not be stressed until their perfusion is improved. In
patients with a dynamic inflow or outflow obstruction, this weakness may be more
pronounced when the patients has an increase in activity.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ There is no age, breed, or sex predilection for cardiogenic shock, and it can occur
at any age.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Pre-existing cardiac disease, particularly DCM.
■ Severe systemic disease associated with a high risk of sepsis.
Historical Findings
■ Variable pending the underlying cause of the cardiogenic shock
■A previous history of cardiac disease (murmur, dysrhythmia)

 Dysrhythmia or pulse deficits
■ Pulsus paradoxus—a decrease in pulse pressure associated with inspiration, an
increase in pulse pressure associated with expiration. This is generally associated
with pericardial effusion.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Hypovolemic shock—Often associated with a history of vomiting, diarrhea, blood
loss, or fluid loss. Patients are often tachycardic or bradycardic (cats) but dysrhyth-
mias or pulmonary edema are less common.
■  Distributive shock—May present similarly to hypovolemic shock; may present with
other clinical signs of infection such as abdominal pain.
          
increased lung sounds, crackles, or cyanosis.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Thoracic radiographs may reveal cardiomegaly, distended pulmonary vasculature.
pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. In cases of DCM or pericardial effusion a
globoid heart may be appreciated.
■ Echocardiography may show a decrease in cardiac contractility, inflow or outflow
obstruction, valvular lesions, or pericardial effusion/tamponade.
■ Electrocardiography may show dysrhythmias (atrial fibrillation common in cases of
DCM), sinus tachycardia, or electrical alternans (alternation of QRS complex size
■ Blood lactate—In cases of impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues and disturbances
in tissue perfusion, anaerobic metabolism results in the production of lactate. The
normal lactate in adult dogs and cats is less than 2.5 mmol/L and levels over 7 mmol/L
indicate severe tissue hypoxia. In resuscitation, serial measurements of blood lactate
can help measure the effectiveness of therapy.
SHOCK—CARDIOGENIC 715
Electrolytes--Hyperkalemia may occur in patients with severe renal injury and oligo-
anuria. Pericardial effusion can lead to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Lasix therapy
can result in hypochloremia and hypokalemia.
Complete blood count may show a stress leukogram.
■ Liver enzyme activities are commonly elevated secondary to impaired hepatic
perfusion.
■ Renal values may be elevated either secondary to pre-renal azotemia (associated with
a concentrated urine specific gravity >1.025 in dogs, >1.035 in cats), or primary renal

dog and 2 to 5cm HO in a cat.
 A urinary catheter may be placed to monitor urine output if there is concern for
oliguria or anuria. The goal is at least 0.5 to l ml/kg per hour
Pathological Findings
■ Myocardial fibrosis and scarring may be present, as well as ischemia secondary to
impaired myocardial blood flow and increased work of the myocardial cells to try
and compensate for the decrease in cardiac output.
 Pulmonary edema and interstitial pneumonia may be seen in cases secondary to the
congestive heart failure, hypoxia, and ischemia in the pulmonary cells
 Hyperemia and ulceration of the intestinal mucosa may occur secondary to impaired
splanchnic perfusion and inflammatory mediators.
 Acute tubular necrosis occurs secondary to decreased renal blood flow and impaired
oxygen delivery to the tubular cells
THERAPEUTICS
■ The objective of treatment is to improve cardiac output and oxygen delivery to the
tissues.
■ Pericardiocentesis is imperative for treatment of any patient with pericardial
tamponade.
■ Positive inotropic support should be provided if contractility is poor and associated
with hypotension.
■ Antiarrhythia medications to control rate if arrhythmia is associated with severe
pulse deficits, inadequate time for ventricular filling, or hypotension.
■ Congestive heart failure should be treated to improve oxygenation and stabilize the
patient.
Drug(s) of Choice
sensitizing agent, dose 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg orally every 12 hours, or dobutamine at 2 to
20μg/kg per minute in dogs and 1 to 5μg/kg per minute in cats.
716
■ Treatment of the congestive heart failure with a diuretic, Lasix 2 to 4 mg/kg IV or
IM every 30 minutes to get out of failure, then 2 mg/kg every 6 to 12 hours
■ In severe cases, nitroprusside can be used in dogs and cats as a vasodilator to treat
congestive heart failure and improve cardiac output by reducing afterload at a dose
of 2 to l0 μg/kg per minute. This is a potent vasodilator so blood pressure should
 be monitored closely to watch for hypotension. If hypotension occurs, the nitroprus-
side should be stopped immediately. In addition, sustained nitroprusside therapy can

■Supraventricular arrhythmias may be treated with diltiazem, dose in dogs 0.25 mg/
kg intravenous bolus over 2 minutes, repeat 0.25 mg/kg IV every 15 minutes until
conversion occurs or up to a total dose of 0.75 mg/kg: in cats 0.5 to 1 mg/kg (up to
1.5) mg/kg PO or per rectum every 8 hours.
■ Oxygen supplementation should be provided; this can be done via oxygen mask,
 Oxygen cage, or nasal cannula. In cases of severe respiratory distress that is unre-
sponsive to diuretic therapy or in which respiratory arrest is imminent, sedation,
intubation, and mechanical ventilation are warranted.
Precautions/Interactions

■ Treatment of the tachycardia may result in hypotension if the tachycardia is a com-
pensatory response to poor cardiac output. Treatment with a positive inotrope should
be instituted to provide myocardial support.
■ Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  medications should  be avoided  in patients
with compromised perfusion to decrease risk of renal and gastrointestinal
complications.

Shock-Distributive
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Shock occurs when the patient is unable to provide effective circulating volume and
oxygen delivery to the tissues. There are numerous classification categories for shock.
In any case, the underlying problem is that the oxygen delivery is not sufficient to
meet the oxygen needs of the tissues resulted in a cellular oxygen and energy debt.
It is important to note that although there may be one predominant category that a
specific patient falls into, one must consider all of the aspects ofeach of the categories
when formulating a treatment plan. For example, in patients with septic shock, they
often have significant protein and fluid losses resulting in hypovolemic shock, as
well as myocardial dysfunction that may present as cardiogenic shock. So although
the different categories of shock will be presented, care must be taken to approach
each patient with an open mind and the realization that in any patient the categories
may overlap considerably.
Distributive shock describes a condition of relative hypovolemia in which there is
massive vasodilation resulting in pooling of the circulating blood volume and
impaired tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Distributive shock has numerous etiologies. The most common cause is septic shock,
but can also occur in anaphylactic and neurogenic shock, as well.
 Sepsis is defined as a SIRS secondary to an infectious process. Septic shock is a pro-
gression of this inflammatory response resulting in cardiovascular dysfunction and
compromise.
 Sepsis can be caused by gram positive, gram negative, aerobic or anaerobic infections,
but gram negative infections are a common cause of septic shock. In gram negative
infections, endotoxin, or LPS, is a component of the outer bacterial cell membrane
and plays a significant role in the stimulation of the inflammatory cascade.
 Endotoxin also stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-o, IL-1,
and IL-6. These cytokines have numerous systemic effects including vasodilation,
myocardial depression, increased gut permeability, and pulmonary inflammation.
 Common causes of septic shock include septic peritonitis resulting from rupture of
gastrointestinal viscera and leakage of intestinal contents or rupture of the urinary
719
or gall bladder with a concomitant urinary tract or biliary infection, pyometra, pneu-
monia, prostatic infection/abscess, pyelonephritis, meningitis, bite wounds, bacterial
endocarditis, or bacterial translocation from severe gastrointestinal disease.
■ Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction to an allergen, antigen, drug or foreign
 protein that leads to release of histamine, extensive vasodilation and increased capil-
lary permeability.
■  Neurogenic shock occurs when severe trauma to the spinal cord results in the loss
of autonomic and motor reflexes below the injury level. The lack of stimulation by
the sympathetic nervous system leads to systemic vasodilation and hypotension. This
form of distributive shock is very rare.
Systems Affected
Cardiovascular—Sepsis leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines that can cause
direct myocardial dysfunction. This sepsis induced myocardial depression is charac-
terized by impaired contractility leading to decreased cardiac output and potential
congestive heart failure. In humans, this myocardial depression is completely revers.
ible if the underlying sepsis resolves. These cytokines also have direct effects on the
vasculature leading to vasodilation and capillary leak. In addition the lactic acidosis
that develops secondary to poor perfusion and impaired oxygen delivery to the
tissues can impair the vascular response to catecholamines.
■ Pulmonary—Inflammatory cytokines, such as INF-α, have been shown to lead to
capillary leak and acute lung injury/ ARDS. Additionally, the myocardial dysfunction
secondary to sepsis can result in pulmonary edema secondary to increased pressure
in the pulmonary vascular bed.
■ Renal—When the mean arterial blood pressure decreases below 60mm Hg. the
kidneys are no longer able to autoregulate and hypotension directly impairs renal
blood flow and oxygen delivery. The kidneys are extremely sensitive to impaired
perfusion, and this may result in renal ischemia and acute tubular necrosis, renal
failure, and oliguria. The significant systemic inflammatory response can also lead
to differential vasodilation and vasoconstriction in the vascular beds further dimin-
ishing oxygen delivery to the kidneys.
■ Gastrointestinal—The splanchnic circulation is also compromised in cases of
impaired perfusion, systemic inflammation, impaired vascular tone, and elevations
 in circulating cytokines. This can result in significant damage to the mucosa, ulcer-
ation, the loss of the intestinal blood barrier, and subsequent bacterial translocation,
intestinal necrosis, and hemorrhage. The combination of decreased splanchnic perfu-
sion, pooling of blood in vascular beds, and significant systemic inflammation also
affects the pancreas and can lead to pancreatitis and further release of inflammatory
mediators into both the abdominal cavity as well as the peripheral circulation.
inflammatory mediators that occur in distributive shock. In addition, the inflamma
tory cytokines also have a direct effect on the hepatocytes and can lead to sepsis-
induced cholestasis, hepatocellular dysfunction, and death. This may lead to impaired

cemia, decrease in the production of clotting factors, decreased protein synthesis.
and hyperbilirubinemia
patients with impaired oxygen delivery and disturbances of the oxygen delivery to
consumption ratio. In addition, the coagulation abnormalities associated with sepsis
and severe systemic inflammation can lead to vascular events (i.e., thrombosis or
hemorrhage) affecting the central nervous system. This can result in cerebral isch-
emia and associated manifestations such as stupor, blindness, and decreased spinal
reflexes. The permanence of these neurologic abnormalities is again related to the
severity and duration of the shock event.
 Musculoskeletal—Musculoskeletal weakness is a common complication in patients
with decreased perfusion and oxygen available to the myocytes. This musculoskeletal
weakness may be profound, and patients should not be stressed until their perfusion
is improved.
Endocrine/metabolic—-Relative adrenal insufficiency is a well documented complica-
tion of sepsis and septic shock. Although the cause of adrenal insufficiency remains
unknown, the most likely culprit is a cytokine-induced decrease in the synthesis or
release of corticotropin-releasing hormone, ACTH, and cortisol. This has been asso-
ciated with an increased vasopressor requirement, prolonged hospitalization, and
increased mortality. Diagnosis is a decreased responsiveness to ACTH stimulation.
although a definitive level at which relative adrenal insufficiency is defined has not
been identified.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
 There is no age, breed, or sex predilection for distributive shock; it can occur at any
age.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Pre-existing immunosuppression, either due to infectious disease (such as feline
leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, or parvovirus), concurrent clinical
conditions such as hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, or medications such as
 long-term steroid use or chemotherapy.

■ Hypovolemic shock often presents very similarly to distributive shock and initial
therapy is similar while investigating the underlying cause.
■ Hypoxic shock—-patients in hypoxic shock are often severely dyspnic, with increased
lung sounds, crackles, or cyanosis.
SHOCK—DISTRIBUTIVE
723
DIAGNOSTICS
Blood lactate—-In cases of impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues and disturbances
in tissue perfusion, anaerobic metabolism results in the production of lactate. The
normallactate in adult dogs and cats is less than 2.5 mmol/L and levels over 7 mmol/L
indicate severe tissue hypoxia. In resuscitation, serial measurements of blood lactate
can help measure the effectiveness of therapy. Monitoring the lactate every 1 to 2
hours as resuscitation is performed can help guide the clinician in the resuscitation
efforts and monitoring the lactate every 6 to 8 hours once it has normalized may
alert the clinician to new problems if there is an acute increase in the lactate levels
It is important to note that in patients with severely compromised perfusion, the
lactate may initially rise after starting fluid therapy and the improved perfusion
flushes lactate out of the poorly perfused periphery. This is a transient increase, and
as resuscitation continues and blood supply to the tissues increases, the levels should
decrease to normal.
 Packed cell volume and total solids—-In cases of severe systemic inflammation, vaso-
dilation and increased vascular permeability, hypoproteinemia is common. In addi-
tion, underlying disease such as peritonitis, gastritis, and hepatic insufficiency
exacerbate the decrease in serum protein levels. The hypoproteinemia may be present
initially or may develop secondary to ongoing protein loss, decreased production by
the liver, decreased intake through the gastrointestinal tract, and dilution from fluid
administration. In addition, blood loss through the gastrointestinal tract or other
ongoing losses can be exacerbated by blood sampling (particularly in cats) and
decreased erythropoietin due to critical illness. Serial monitoring is important to
monitor protein levels and identify when additional therapies such as colloid therapy
or transfusions are indicated.
anuria, hypernatremia, and hyperchloremia may be seen in cases with severe dehy
dration and water loss.
Complete blood count may show evidence of anemia, a neutrophilia with a left shift
associated with infection, leukopenia in severe sepsis, and thrombocytopenia.
Liver values are commonly elevated secondary to impaired hepatic perfusion.
 Renal values may be elevated either secondary to prerenal azotemia (associated with
a concentrated urine specific gravity >1.025 in dogs, >1.035 in cats), or primary renal
azotemia secondary to renal hypoxia and ischemic injury.
 Central venous pressure can be an aid in assessing volume status objectively, with a
goal of 5 to 10cm HzO in a dog and 2 to 5cm HzO in a cat.
 A urinary catheter may be placed to monitor urine output if there is concern for
oliguria or anuria. The goal is at least 0.5 to l ml/kg per hour.
Thoracic radiographs may show pulmonary infiltrate associated with acute lung
injury, pneumonia, or other parenchymal disease.
 Abdominal radiographs may show evidence of free air in the abdomen if there is a
rupture of the gastrointestinal tract associated with septic peritonitis
■ECG may document impaired myocardial contractility secondary to the sepsis associ-
ated myocardial dysfunction.
■ ECG to evaluate for any cardiac arrhythmias secondary to myocardial ischemia or
electrolyte abnormalities
Pathological Findings
splanchnic perfusion and inflammatory mediators.
■ Acute tubular necrosis occurs secondary to decreased renal blood flow and loss of
autoregulation leading to impaired oxygen delivery to the tubular cells.
■ Interstitial pneumonia may be seen in cases secondary to the hypoxia and ischemia
in the pulmonary cells with subsequent release of inflammatory mediators.
■ Myocardial ischemia secondary to impaired myocardial blood flow and increased
work of the myocardial cells to try to compensate for the decrease in cardiac output
THERAPEUTICS
■ The objective of treatment is to provide intravascular fluid volume to maintain
cardiac preload and thereby blood flow and oxygen delivery to the tissues.
■ Identification and treatment of the underlying source of infection are essential in the
treatment of septic shock. This may include surgical drainage or resection of infected
 tissues or aggressive antibiotic therapy in cases of systemic infections such as pneu-
monia or pyelonephritis.
■ Crystalloid therapy with a balanced isotonic solution at an initial rate of up to
90 ml/kg in dogs and 60 ml/kg in cats
■ It should be noted that intravenous crystalloids should be used judiciously in cats
because the lung is the shock organ in the cat and fluid overload and pulmonary
An initial bolus of 15 to 20ml/kg every 15 to 20 minutes up to 60 ml/kg is often
effective at providing fluid resuscitation while avoiding fluid overload and pulmonary
edema.
■  In patients that are hypoproteinemic or remain volume deplete despite crystalloid
therapy, colloids such as hetastarch of dextran may be used at a rate of 5 to 10 ml/kg
as a bolus in dogs and 3 to 5 ml/kg as a bolus in cats. The total colloid administered
should be less than 20 ml/kg per day to avoid secondary coagulopathies.
 Hypertonic saline is another hyperoncotic solution and may be administered at a rate
of 5 to l0 ml/kg. The effects of this fluid is rapid, but they do not last very long and
care should be taken in hypernatremia patients.
■ Hemoglobin based oxygen carriers provide an increased oxygen-carrying ability as
well as exert a colloid effect. These substances, such as Oxyglobin, may be useful in
improving systemic tissue perfusion and some investigators have theorized they may
also improve perfusion to the microvasculature. It should be noted, however, that
SHOCK—DISTRIBUTIVE725
the colloidal effect of these substances is profound, and again care should be used
when using this fluid choice in our patients. particularly cats, to avoid fluid
overload.
■ Oxygen supplementation—either via mask, oxygen cage, or oxygen hood.
Drug(s) of Choice
 In cases that remain hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy with
dopamine 5 to 20μg/kg per minute, norepinephrine 0.05 to 2μg/kg per minute, or
epinephrine 0.005 to l μg/kg per minute may be utilized. Alternatively, positive
inotropy may also be provided using dobutamine 2 to 20μg/kg per minute in dogs
 and l to 5μg/kg per minute in cats.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  medications should be avoided  in patients
with compromised  perfusion to  decrease risk of  renal  and  gastrointestinal
complications.
Diet
■ Once the patient has stabilized, enteral or parenteral nutrition should be instituted
to address the hypermetabolic state the patient is in.
Surgical Considerations
■  Aggressive drainage or debridement of any devitalized tissue is warranted to remove
the source of infection.

Shock-Hypovolemic
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Shock is defined as any condition that results in inadequate effective circulating
volume and oxygen delivery to the tissues. In any classification scheme, the underly-
ing problem is that the oxygen delivery is not suficient to meet the oxygen needs
of the tissues. This leads to a cellular oxygen and energy debt. It is important to note
that although there may be one predominant category that a specific patient falls
into, one must consider all of the aspects of each of the categories when formulating
a treatment plan. For example, a patient with severe Gl disease and hemorrhagic
diarrhea may initially present in hypovolemic shock, but as the clinical disease pro-
gresses the Gl blood barrier may become compromised leading to bacterial transloca
tion, systemic septicemia, and septic shock. This can then go on to affect the heart
and lead to impaired myocardial contractility, thus exhibiting signs of cardiogenic
shock. So although the different categories of shock will be presented, care must be
taken to approach each patient with an open mind and the realization that the catego-
ries may overlap considerably.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 Hypovolemic shock is a common cause of shock in our veterinary patients.
 Occurs when loss of intravascular fluid leads to decreased venous return to the heart
and subsequent decreased in cardiac output. This decrease in effective circulating
volume can occur secondary to blood loss (either via external or internal hemor-
rhage), water loss through the Gl tract or the kidneys, water loss through the skin.

 n    r  s o  
tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction.
 Decreased renal perfusion stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and
causes sodium and water retention and stimulates the sympathetic nervous system.
 Decreased perfusion is sensed by the hypothalamus and leads to ACTH-mediated
release of cortisol, aldosterone, and catecholamines.
 The goal of these compensatory mechanisms is to maintain cardiac output in the
early stages of shock (compensatory phase), but these all require metabolic energy
and if the oxygen delivery to the tissues remains less than the demands of the tissue,

the cellular hypoxia and oxygen debt will rapidly progress into organ dysfunction
and death. When fluid loss is large enough to overwhelm compensatory mechanisms.
it leads to an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand in the tissues. If the
oxygen delivery to the tissues remains less than the tissue oxygen demands, cellular
hypoxia and oxygen debt will rapidly progress into organ dysfunction and death if
not rapidly correct through treatment.
■ Common causes of blood loss include rupture of an internal viscus (i.e., splenic or
hepatic mass), Gl hemorrhage and fluid loss (i.e., parvovirus, NSAID- or steroid-
induced gastric ulceration, or other primary intestinal disease), trauma and blood
loss from a fracture, laceration or internal injury, or hemorrhage secondary to coagu-
lopathy (i.e., rodenticide, inherited factor deficiencies)
 Hypovolemia secondary to fluid loss may include severe Gl loss through protracted
vomiting or diarrhea, renal water loss secondary to primary renal disease and loss of
concentrating ability or diabetes insipidus, water loss through severe burns and
cutaneous losses, or third spacing of fluids into the peritoneal cavity
Systems Affected
■Cardiovascular
 Decreased cardiac pre-load and cardiac output
 Catecholamine induced peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia and an increase
in myocardial oxygen consumption.

Myocardial cell ischemia and dysrhythmias.
■ Persistent myocardial cell hypoxia leads to impaired cardiac contractility and

siveness to catecholamines (both endogenous and exogenous).
■ Cats may exhibit bradycardia or tachycardia
■Pulmonary
  Increased minute ventilation and respiratory rate during early stages of hypovo-
lemic shock causes increased pulmonary oxygen consumption.
swelling, and release of inflammatory mediators.
  Inflammatory mediators can then result in acute lung injury and eventually acute
respiratory distress syndrome as high protein fluid leaks from the parenchymal
cells into the alveolar space. This can further impair oxygenation and oxygen
delivery to the tissues.
■ The lungs are commonly described as the shock organ in the cat.
■Renal
■ In the early stages of shock the autoregulatory ability of the kidneys is able to
maintain blood flow via vasoconstriction of the afferent artericle and sodium and
water retention.
SHOCK—HYPOVOLEMIC729
■ When the mean arterial blood pressure decreases below 60 mm Hg. the kidneys
are no longer able to autoregulate and hypotension directly impairs the blood flow
and oxygen delivery.
■ The kidneys are extremely sensitive to impaired perfusion and decreased GFR:
this may result in renal ischemia and acute tubular necrosis, and oliguria.
Gastrointestinal
■  The splanchnic circulation is significantly compromised in cases of impaired per-
fusion. The GI tract is considered to be the shock organ in dogs, so impaired GI
function is common with hypovolemic shock.
 The compensatory mechanisms and increase in catecholamines and vasoconstric-
tion can significantly impair blood flow to the intestines. This can result in ulcer
ation, the loss of the intestinal blood barrier and subsequent bacterial translocation
intestinal necrosis, mucosal sloughing, and hemorrhage.
■ Decreased splanchnic perfusion can also affect the pancreas, leading to pancreati-
tis and release of inflammatory mediators into both the abdominal cavity as well
as into peripheral circulation.
■ leus, vomiting, and diarrhea may be observed as a consequence of hypovolemia
and hypotension.
■Hepatic
■ The decreased oxygen delivery can cause ischemia and cellular death in the hepa-
tocytes. This can further lead to impaired hepatic function including a decrease
in gluconeogenesis and subsequent hypoglycemia, decrease in the production of
clotting factors, decreased protein synthesis, and intrahepatic cholestasis.
■ The extent, severity and duration of the dysfunction are variable and related
to both the severity as well as the duration of the impaired perfusion and
decreased oxygen delivery. In severe cases, coagulopathies and hepatic failure can
result.
Nervous
■ In patients with impaired oxygen delivery and disturbances of the oxygen delivery
to consumption ratio, neurologic impairment may occur.
■ Delirium and cognitive defects are common in humans, but less appreciated in
our veterinary patients.
■ In cases of severe shock in which the blood flow to the brain is significantly
impaired, cerebral ischemia may develop and clinical manifestations such as
stupor, blindness, and decreased spinal reflexes may be noted.
■ The permanence of these neurologic abnormalities is again related to the severity
and duration of the shock event.
 Musculoskeletal
■ Musculoskeletal weakness is common in patients in shock. The decreased perfu-
sion results in lactate production and decreased oxygen available to the
myocytes.
■ This musculoskeletal weakness may be profound, and patients should not be
stressed until their perfusion is improved.
Endocrine/metabolic
 Marked decreases in blood flow to the adrenal glands can result in ischemia and
infarction to these organs.
■ Adrenal ischemia can result in decreased function and decreased glucocorticoid
or mineralocorticoid production. Relative adrenal insufficiency is common in
 shock states in humans and can exacerbate poor responsiveness to fluid therapy.
■ In addition, severe systemic stress that occurs secondary to the hypotensive crisis
can lead to both insulin resistance as well as decreased insulin production second-
ary to severe ischemia to the pancreas, resulting in hyperglycemia.
 Skin/exocrine
■ In cases of severe burn injury or significant cutaneous wounds, dramatic water
loss can occur and this may lead to a hypotensive crisis. In these cases, care should
be taken to address the wounds as soon as possible to minimize additional fluid
loss.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
at any age.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ There are no specific risk factors associated with the development of hypovolemic
shock.
■ Predisposing coagulopathies (either inherited factor deficiencies, contact with anti-
coagulant rodenticides or thrombocytopenia)
■ Gastric ulceration secondary to steroidal or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy
■ Exposure to parvovirus and inadequate vaccination status

tion progresses.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Cardiogenic shock may be associated with a pre-existing cardiac condition, pulmo-
nary edema, muffled heart sounds, or arrhythmias.
Distributive shock often presents very similarly to hypovolemic shock and initial
therapy is similar while investigating the underlying cause.
 Hypoxic shock—-patients in hypoxic shock are often severely dyspnic with increased
lung sounds, crackles, or cyanosis.
DIAGNOSTICS
■Blood lactate
■ Lactate production secondary to impaired tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery.
■ Normal lactate in adult dogs and cats is less than 2.5 mmol/L.
■Lactate >7 mmol/L indicates severe tissue hypoxia.
732
 Serial blood lactate measurements can help measure the effectiveness of fluid
resuscitation therapy.
■ Monitor every 1 to 2 hours to guide resuscitation efforts
■Monitor every 6 to 8 hours once lactate has normalized.
■ May alert the clinician to new problems if there is an acute increase in the
lactate levels.
  Note: in patients with severely compromised perfusion, the lactate may initially
rise after starting fluid therapy and the improved perfusion flushes lactate out
of the poorly perfused periphery. This is a transient increase, and as resuscita-
tion continues and blood supply to the tissues increases, the levels should
decrease to normal.
■ PCV and total solids
■ In cases of hemorrhagic shock, the blood loss may not initially be apparent due
to splenic contraction in dogs (splenic contraction has a much less marked effect
in cats) or ongoing blood loss.
■ Once the patient has received intravenous fluids to help improve perfusion, the
PCV may decrease significantly.
■ In cases of ongoing blood loss, serial monitoring is important to determine when
and if the patient needs blood component therapy.
■ Protein loss, either via the GI tract, hemorrhage, or cutaneous loss, may also
contribute significantly to the hypovolemia. Serial monitoring of this will also help
guide the clinician as to when colloids are indicated. Measurement of the packed
cell volume and total solids every 6 to 8 hours in indicated to identify and guide
treatment in these cases
 Electrolytes—-Hyperkalemia may occur in patients with severe renal injury and oligo-
anuria, hypernatremia, and hyperchloremia may be seen in cases with severe dehy.
dration and water loss
 Complete blood count may show evidence of anemia and a stress leukogram, and
provide a platelet count
 Liver values are commonly elevated secondary to impaired hepatic perfusion
■  Renal values may be elevated either secondary to prerenal azotemia (associated with
a concentrated urine specific gravity >1.025 in dogs, >l.035 in cats), or primary renal
azotemia secondary to renal hypoxia and ischemic injury.
■ Central venous pressure can be an aid in assessing volume status objectively, with a
goal of 5 to 10cm H,O in a dog and 2 to 5cm H,O in a cat.
 Coagulation times (PT and PTT) to investigate for any coagulopathies
■ A urinary catheter may be placed to monitor urine output if there is concern for
oliguria or anuria. The goal is at least 0.5 to l ml/kg per hour.
■ ECG to evaluate for any cardiac arrhythmias secondary to myocardial ischemia or
electrolyte abnormalities
Thoracic radiography can allow visualization of subjective cardiac size, and appear
ance of the caudal vena cava. The cardiac silhouette may be slightly elevated from
the sternum on a lateral thoracic radiograph of an animal with hypovolemic shock.
Additionally the caudal vena cava may appear smaller than normal.
SHOCK—HYPOVOLEMIC
733
Pathological Findings
splanchnic perfusion and inflammatory mediators
Acute tubular necrosis occurs secondary to decreased renal blood flow and loss of
autoregulation leading to impaired oxygen delivery to the tubular cells.
  Interstitial pneumonia may be seen in cases secondary to the hypoxia and ischemia
in the pulmonary cells with subsequent release of inflammatory mediators.
 Myocardial ischemia secondary to impaired myocardial blood flow and increased
work of the myocardial cells to try to compensate for the decrease in cardiac output.
 Microvascular thrombosis and hemorrhage may be apparent in affected tissues.
THERAPEUTICS
The objective of treatment is to restore intravascular fluid volume to maintain cardiac
preload and thereby improve cardiac output, tissue blood flow, and oxygen delivery.
In cases of ongoing blood loss secondary to a bleeding mass or injury, surgical inter-
vention to control the hemorrhage should be done as soon as possible, stabilizing
the patient as much as possible prior to anesthesia.
 Crystalloid therapy with a balanced isotonic solution at an initial rate of up to 90 ml/
kg in dogs and 60 ml/kg in cats (titrate in incremental doses while monitoring heart
rate, blood pressure, and capillary refill time); one method is to administer one-
fourth of the calculated volumes listed, then reassess perfusion parameters of heart
rate, blood pressure, capillary refill time, pulse quality, and urine output.
   a   r  e sd  
therapy colloids such as hetastarch of dextran may be used at a rate of 5 to 10 ml/kg
as a bolus in dogs and 3 to 5 ml/kg as a bolus in cats. Ideally, the total colloid admin-
istered should be less than 20 ml/kg per day to avoid secondary coagulopathies.
Hypertonic saline is another hyperoncotic solution and may be administered at a rate
of 5 to 10 ml/kg. The effects of this fluid is rapid, but do not last very long and care
should be taken in hypernatremia patients
■Hemoglobin based oxygen carriers provide an increased oxygen carrying ability as
well as exert a colloid effect. These substances, such as Oxyglobin, may be useful in
improving tissue perfusion systemically and some investigators have theorized they
may also improve perfusion to the microvasculature. It should be noted, however,
that the colloidal effect of these substances is profound and care should be used to
avoid intravascular volume overload.
■ Whole blood, plasma, or PRBCs also may be considered in anemia or hypocoaguable
patients.
Drug(s) of Choice
dopamine 5 to 20 mcg/kg per minute, norepinephrine 0.05 to 2μg/kg per minute, or
734BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
epinephrine 0.005 to lμg/kg per minute may be utilized. Alternatively, positive
inotropy may also be provided using dobutamine 2 to 20μg/kg per minute in dogs
and 1 to 5μg/kg per minute in cats.
 Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered when bacterial translocation can exist.
tension, and renal perfusion have been adequately restored. Ampicillin (10-40 mg/kg
IV three to four times daily) or Timentin (50 mg/kg three times daily), enrofloxacin
(5-10 mg/kg every 24 hours), and metronidazole (7.5-15 mg/kg IV three times daily)
provide triple antibiotic coverage for high-risk patients.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications should be avoided in patients with
compromised perfusion to decrease risk of renal and Gl complications, due to
decreases in vasodilatory prostaglandins.
■ Corticosteroids have shown no documented benefits in the treatment of shock and
can also increase the risk of Gl ulceration and immunosuppression in higher doses.
 Corticosteroids may be indicated at physiologic doses in cases of suspected relative
adrenal insufficiency based on refractory hypotension after adequate fluid resuscita-
tion and vasopressor therapy have been attempted first.
Diet
■ Once the patient has stabilized, enteral or parenteral nutrition should be instituted
to address the hypermetabolic state the patient is in.
Surgical Considerations
■  In patients with ongoing hemorrhage, stabilizing them prior to anesthesia is chal-
lenging and may require simultaneous administration of fluids, blood products, and
rapid anesthetic induction.
■ The majority of blunt trauma cases with hemoabdomen or hemothorax do not
require surgical intervention because bleeding resolves in most cases with fluid and
blood component therapy alone.

Prevention/Avoidance
■ Careful attention to hemostasis intra-operatively and monitoring of PCV and perfu-
sion parameters postoperatively helps to reduce the risk of significant blood loss.
 In patients with large volumes of vomit, diarrhea, or third spacing of fluids, hypo-
volemia can occur rapidly so recording sensible fluid losses and frequent body weight
changes in addition to the urine output helps to match fluid requirements
appropriately.

Smoke Inhalation
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
1 Inhalation injury from smoke and the noxious products of combustion in fires
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 The three primary mechanisms that lead to injury in smoke inhalation are: thermal
damage, asphyxiation, and pulmonary irritation.
Thermal Damage
 Direct burns are usually limited to the nasal and oral pharyngeal mucosa and the
upper airways. This is due to the efficient heat exchange capacity of the upper
airways. Inflammation and edema of the supraglottic area and larynx occur within
the first several hours of injury. Steam and soot (airborne particulate matter <3μm
in size) may cause thermal injuries to the lower airways and alveoli.
Asphyxiation
■ Tissue hypoxia can occur secondary to several mechanisms that include a decrease
in the FiO (hypoxic asphyxia), decreased ability to carry oxygen (functional anemia).
decreased tissue perfusion (hypovolemia, shock), and disruption of the cells' ability
 to utilize oxygen (altered cellular respiration) that leads to anaerobic metabolism.
1 Combustion progressively consumes oxygen and significantly decreases the ambient
concentration of oxygen from average 2l percent to as low as 15 percent. The
decrease in FiO, leads to hypoxemia.
■ CO is a common component of smoke produced by the incomplete combustion
of any organic material
 CO causes tissue hypoxia by decreasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
Hemoglobin binds CO with an affinity more than 200 times greater than hemo-
globin's affnity for oxygen.
 CO also causes a left shift in the hemoglobin/oxygen saturation curve and prevents
release of oxygen to the tissues.
 CO has been shown to poison the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase chain, as
well as decrease myocardial contractility by binding to myocardial myoglobin.
737
■ Combustion of common household substances such as plastic, polyurethane,
wool, silk, nylon, rubber, and paper products can lead to the production of cyanide
 gas. Cyanide is a chemical asphyxiant that interferes with cellular metabolism by
binding to the ferric ion on cytochrome c oxidase, and subsequently halts cellular
respiration. As a result, anaerobic metabolism ensues, with corresponding high
lactate acidosis.
■Methemoglobinemia occurs in fire due to heat denaturation of hemoglobin, oxides
produced in fire, and metHb-forming materials such as nitrites. The pathophysi-
capacity of the blood and a shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the
left, similar to that seen with production of HbCO.
Pulmonary Irritation
■ Chemical irritants in smoke include sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, ammonia,
and acroleins.
■ Soot heightens the effect of the aforementioned irritants by binding them and allow-
ing adherence and reaction with respiratory mucosal surfaces
and intense pulmonary inflammation.
■ The direct injury to the pulmonary mucosa is a consequence of the size of the par-
ticles, particle's water solubility, and their acid-alkaline properties. The inflammatory
 reaction develops secondary to the initial irritant injury to respiratory mucosal cells.
         o 
inspissated secretions, increased mucosal airway edema, and reflexive bronchospasm.
Damaged mucosal cells stimulate copious exudates rich in protein, inflammatory
cells, and necrotic debris.
■ With progressive smoke exposure, mucosal sloughing ensues and forms casts of the
airways. Airway casts block the passage of oxygen to the alveoli.
■ The irritants may also cause acute inactivation of surfactant that leads to atelectasis
and decreased pulmonary compliance.

DIAGNOSTICS
■ Emergency database: PCV, TS, blood glucose, BUN, lactate, electrolytes, and arterial
blood gases should be performed in all critically ill patients with smoke exposure.
■ Persistent metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis may indicate carbon monoxide,
methemoglobinemia, or cyanide intoxication and secondary tissue hypoxia. Co-
oximetry would be helpful to determine the cause of metabolic acidosis.
■ Fluorescein stain cornea and check behind nictitans for corneal burns and debris
(Figure 96.3)
SMOKE INHALATION
741
 Figure 96.3 Careful irrigation of the eyes, including behind the nictitans, followed by fluorescein stain should
always be performed to rule out corneal injuries
Complete blood cell count: Neutrophilia (inflammatory leukogram) or neutropenia
(due to neutrophil sequestration in the lungs: poor prognostic sign)
 Imaging: Thoracic radiographs should always be performed to establish a baseline
and progression of lung. Radiographic abnormalities can lag behind clinical progres.
sion and vary from normal to bronchointerstitial to alveolar patterns.
 Bronchoscopy and BAL should be performed if there is suspicion of superimposed
bacterial pneumonia (moist cough, fever). BAL procedure will allow visual inspection
of the upper airways and bronchi, as well as collection for cytological and culture
analysis of pulmonary fluid samples.
Pathological Findings
■ The clinical sequence of events can be divided into early, intermediate, and late
phases.
■  In the initial 24 to 36 hours after smoke exposure tissue hypoxia from immediately
or delayed effects of heat, irritant gases, and soot. Upper and lower airway obstruc-
tion, systemic toxic effects of CO, cyanide, and methemoglobinemia can lead to
immediate or delayed neurologic abnormalities. However, if there was minimal
exposure to smoke, the damage may be limited to inflammation of the oronasal and
ocular mucosal surfaces without any other major sequela.
 If skin burns are present and the respiratory tract is edematous then the injuries are
more likely to be life threatening. Burns or edematous respiratory tissue enhance the
toxic effects of smoke inhalation and leads to progressive pulmonary dysfunction.
 Asphyxia, pulmonary edema, and bacterial pneumonia are potential long-term
complications.
■ Bacterial pneumonia secondary to smoke-induced pulmonary injury is the most
common late complication and has a mortality rate that approaches 50 percent.
■ Cerebral edema can also develop during the long-term phases due to severe or pro-
longed hypoxia.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Maintenance of airway patency, adequate oxygenation and ventilation, stabilization
of hemodynamic parameters, and decontamination measures of the skin and eyes.
■ Animals with severe upper airway obstruction should be intubated. Supportive care
and careful monitoring should be instituted early on in the management of smoke
inhalation patients because they have the potential to deteriorate rapidly.
■Tracheostomy should be considered for animals with complete airway obstruction.
Drug(s) of Choice
 Oxygen therapy should be provided through a tight-fitting mask, oxygen cage or an
endotracheal tube in order to improve hemoglobin oxygenation and decrease the
half-life of HbCO. Administer high-flow humidified oxygen (up to 100 percent con-
d     s t n    (s

guided suctioning of airway secretions.
■ Titratable intravenous fluid therapy to correct shock and maintain hydration.
Consider the use of synthetic colloids (Hetastarch 10-20 ml/kg per day) to prevent
pulmonary edema in the face of increased pulmonary vascular permeability.
■  Nebulization of saline and coupage to help thin and clear airway secretions.
 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy is not warranted in animals with smoke inhalation.
However, animals with fever and WBC changes on the CBC (persistent neutrophilia
or neutropenia) should be treated with broad spectrum antimicrobials (i.e., cefazolin
or ampicillin each at 22 mg/kg IV every 6 to 8 hours plus enrofloxacin at 10 mg/kg
every 24 hours) while awaiting culture and sensitivity results of pulmonary fluid
samples.
■Corticosteroids are not recommended as they may predispose to secondary bacterial
pneumonia. However, NSAIDs (i.e., carprofen 2.2mg/kg SQ or PO [dog] every 12
hours; meloxicam 0.l mg/kg SQ or PO every 24 hours) and analgesics (fentanyl
 2-4 μg/kg per hour IV CRI or buprenorphine 15μg/kg IV, IM, SQ or sublingual every
8 hours) can relive inflammation and discomfort.
■ Fast-acting bronchodilators such as β-agonists (i.e., albuterol inhalers 90μg per
inhalation: 2 puffs every 4 hours, albuterol prefilled vials of 2.5 mg albuterol in 3-ml
sterile saline for nebulization: one vial nebulized every 4 hours, or, terbutaline:

 because they may predispose the patient to bacterial pneumonia.
Diet
  Nutritional support (enteral or parenteral) to preserve immune status and prevent a
catabolic state.
Activity
■ Dependent on oxygen tolerance.
Surgical Considerations
 Debride any devitalized or necrotic tissue.
  Increased risk with general anesthesia and severe pulmonary infiltrates.
COMMENTS
  The pulse oximeter can be misleading in the setting of CO exposure or methemo-
globinemia because it measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin only and
not any other form of hemoglobin. It tends to overestimate the level of oxygenation
of hemoglobin due to concurrent binding with CO.
■ Co-oximeters transmit four wavelengths of light through a blood sample, instead of
two wavelengths transmitted by a pulse oximeter, and in addition to HbO, and Hb.
are capable of detecting methemoglobin and HbCO.
 Arterial blood gas analysis will also be unable to accurately determine the hemoglo.
bin oxygen saturation as it cannot differentiate between HbO, and HbCO saturation.
However, serial analysis of the A-a gradient will yield invaluable information on
      d s 
within the lungs and secondary bacterial infection.
Patient Monitoring
 Respiratory rate and effort, auscultation of the neck and thorax, rectal temperatures
(every 4 hours), serial measurements of arterial blood gases, electrolytes and PCV/
TS, BUN and lactate (every 24 hours) ensure adequate organ perfusion and resolv-
ing hypoxia. CBCs should be repeated (every 24 hours) if there is any evidence of
clinical deterioration such as moist cough or fever. Thoracic radiographs should be
repeated in 48 hours to rule out pneumonia, acute lung injury, and pulmonary
edema.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Owners should be educated regarding residential sprinkler systems and smoke
alarms, fire extinguishers, and stickers for doors that inform rescuers of the quantity
and type of animals that live in the residency.
Possible Complications
■ Acute phases: Development of bacterial pulmonary infections, acute lung injury
ARDS
■ Long term: From asymptomatic to possible chronic pulmonary changes (chronic
bronchitis secondary to inflammation and scar tissue formation) and CNs dysfunc-
tion (ataxia and abnormal behavior or loss of hearing secondary to delayed effects
of CO on the CNS)
Expected Course and Prognosis
   s P    s  n     
without concurrent evidence of severe skin burns. Deteriorating respiratory function,
severe burns, and hypoxic organ damage that occurs within 24 hours of hospitaliza-
tion carry a poor prognosis.
■ Dogs and cats that present with signs that stabilize by 24 hours generally carry a
favorable prognosis.

Snake Bite-Coral Snakes
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Coral snakes are members of the family Elapidae (fixed front-fang snakes).
Two genera of coral snakes are found in the United States. The Sonoran coral snake
Micruroides euryxanthus is of central and southeastern Arizona and southwest New
Mexico. The other genus is represented by three subspecies of Micrurus fulvius,
including the Texas coral snake (M.f. tenere), the Eastern coral snake (M.f fulvius),
and the South Florida coral snake (M.f. barbouri).
■ The Texas coral snake (eastern and south central Texas, north into southern Arkansas
and Louisiana).
 The Eastern coral snake (the eastern seaboard from North Carolina south to Florida.
west to Alabama and Mississippi, and throughout eastern Louisiana to the Mississippi
River).
 The South Florida coral snake (southern Florida to the northern Florida Keys).
Natural History
1 Coral snakes are distinctively colored with an alternating body pattern of black,
yellow (occasionally white), and red. They can be distinguished from similar appear-
ing nonvenomous snakes by the color bands. In coral snakes the color bands com-
pletely encircle the snake, and the yellow band touches the red.
In North America only, coral snakes have a black snout. This is easier to differentiate
than trying to remember the mnemonic “red or yellow, kill a fellow. Red on black,
venom lack." Simply look for the black snout. (Caution: This does not hold true for
South America!)
■ Coral snakes have round pupils, no facial pits for heat sensing prey, and their heads
are not triangular.
■ Coral snakes have short, fixed front fangs and a relatively poor venom delivery
system. They must “chew” to inject the venom. Human and animal victims often
need the biting snake manually removed.
 The Sonoran coral snake genus Micruroides is shy, retiring, nocturnal, small, nonag-
gressive, and burrowing on contact with humans, dogs, cats, or livestock. Venom
potency of this snake is relatively low. Bites to companion animals are unlikely. There
are no reported fatalities in humans, dogs, or cats due to envenomation by this snake.
The majority of bites in humans occur in handlers.

coral, Eastern coral, and South Florida coral snake)

victims and need to be removed causing what has been described as a “Velcro" sound.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■Coral snake venom actually is primarily neurotoxic involving little local tissue reac-
tion or pain at the bite site
■ Coral snake venom is a complex mixture of polypeptides including cholinesterase
and acetylcholine
■ Several neurotoxins may be involved and act as nondepolarizing postsynaptic neu-
romuscular blocking agents.
■ Coral snake venom induces central nervous system depression, muscle paralysis, and
vasomotor instability.
■ These neurotoxins combine to produce a "curare-like” syndrome; unlike curare this
nondepolarizing blocking of acetylcholine receptor sites has a slow onset and a mark-
edly prolonged duration.
■ In dogs, the enzymatic fraction can cause hemolysis and a resultant hemolytic anemia
with hemoglobinuria. It has been theorized that phospholipase A is responsible by
directly damaging the red blood cell membrane.
 In cats, enzymatic effects may induce myoglobin release.
■Hyaluronidase, phosphodiesterase, proteinase, ribonuclease, and desoxyribonuclease
are other enzyme components of coral snake venom that can cause tissue destruction.
Nevertheless, tissue nerosis and edema in coral snake bites are nowhere near what
is seen in crotalid envenomations
■ Venom uptake can be delayed up to 12 hours or more and can take 7 to 14 days to
clear the body.
Toxic Dose
■ The severity of coral snake bites is related to both the volume of venom injected and
the size of the victim.
■  Due to the primitive venom delivery system, snakes must chew and a large percent-
age of coral snake bites are non-envenomating (*"dry").
■ The human lethal dose is 4 to 5 mg of venom.
■ A large coral snake can deliver four to five lethal doses in a single bite (20mg of
venom).
■ Length of snake positively correlates with the snake's venom yield
■ Although bites by coral snakes are relatively rare (only l percent of all venomous
snake bites in humans), it is estimated that the human fatality rate due to coral snake
envenomation is as high as 10 percent.
SNAKE BITE—CORAL SNAKES749
1The volume of venom injected is proportional to the motivation of the snake (i.e..
offensive, defensive, or agonal bite) along with the duration of the bite and the
intensity of the chewing action.
CLINICAL FEATURES
The appearance of clinical signs may be delayed as much as 10 to 18 hours.
 Regional signs around the bite can be minimal involving only the puncture wounds.
local pain, and possible regional parasthesia.
■ Clinical signs next progress to altered mental status, generalized weakness, and
muscle fasiculations.
  Next the progression of signs involves paralysis of the limbs and respiratory muscu-
lature. This sequence of signs is consistent with bulbar dysfunction.
 Patients can display marked salivation, pharyngeal paralysis, spasms of the mastica-
tory muscles, and respiratory failure.
Aspiration pneumonia secondary to hypersalivation and dysphagia is not
uncommon.
■  In addition to these general manifestations, clinical signs of coral snake envenom-
ation vary depending on the species bitten.
■ In dogs, hypersalivation, vomiting. acute central nervous system depression,
decreased spinal reflexes in all limbs with quadriplegia and respiratory paralysis have
been described.
 In addition in canine victims, anemia, hemoglobinuria, intravascular hemolysis, and
morphologic alterations of red blood cells may be seen.
■ Hypotension and ventricular tachycardia can also be seen in dogs bitten by coral
snakes.
 Generally, hemolysis occurs within 72 hours of envenomation.
 Some dogs can show diarrhea and blood-tinged urine.
■ In cats, clinical signs after coral snake envenomation include: acute, ascending
flaccid quadriplegia, reduced nociperception, and central nervous system
depression.
■Additional signs seen in cats can include; hypothermia, anisocoria, loss of cutaneous
trunci reflex, and loss of spinal reflexes in all four limbs.
tain normal anal tone and micturition.
■Hemolysis and hemoglobinuria in dogs is not reported in cats.
■ Clinical signs from bites of the Sonoran coral snake (Micruroides euryxanthus)
local paresthesia all resolve in about 24 hours in humans bitten by these
snakes.
■ The usual cause of death in coral snake bite victims is respiratory collapse.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Differential diagnosis of coral snake envenomation include: tick paralysis, botulism,
macadamia nut ingestion (dogs only), bromethalin, ionophone poisoning. organo-
phosphate toxicity, acute polyneuritis, iatrogenic drug administration, polyradiculo-
neuritis, and myasthenia gravis.
DIAGNOSTICS
■No specific diagnostic tests exist to establish a coral snake bite.
■ Diagnosis depends upon eyewitness accounts, onset of clinical signs, time of year.
 regional probability, and likelihood of companion animal-snake interaction.
■ Local lesions are nondiagnostic, small puncture wounds with minimal swelling.
■ Laboratory work should include a complete blood count and biochemical profile.
Hyperfibrinogenemia, moderate leukocytosis, and elevated creatinine kinase have all
been reported in animals after coral snake bite envenomation.
■ Elevation of creatinine kinase is an indication envenomation has occurred.
■ In dogs, anemia, intravascular hemolysis, and hematuria can occur. Dogs bitten may
sive anemia.
■ In cats, increased myoglobin and alkaline phosphatose can occur as a result of
rhabdomyolysis.
ation due to dysphagia and pharyngeal paralysis, radiographs of the thorax of enven-
omated animals may be indicated.
THERAPEUTICS
■ The best predictor of successful treatment of coral snake envenomation is early.
aggressive therapy.
■ Interventions to be avoided include: ice, hot packs, incision, and electroshock
therapy. Suction is of limited value.
■  Compression bandage wraps involving the entire bitten extremity are recommended
for many elapid bites. Recommended is no tighter than wrap for a sprained ankle
and not removed until antivenin is administered.
■ Because the onset of clinical signs may take several hours, coral snake bite victims
must be hospitalized and closely monitored. Pretreatment blood work must be
 obtained, maintenance intravenous fluid therapy initiated, and cardiac and pulse
oximetry monitored.
■ Coral snake bite victims must be closely examined for aspiration pneumonia, a
common sequela.
SNAKE BITE—CORAL SNAKES751
The only definitive treatment for coral snake envenomation is coral snake antivenin
(M. fulvius) made by Wyeth Laboratories (Marietta, Pennsylvania). There is no other
approved coral snake antivenin available.
■However, Australian tiger snake (Notechis scutatus) and the Mexican coral snake
(Micrurus species) antivenins have shown protective cross-reactivity and efficacy
against North American coral snake (M. fulvius fulvius) venom in mouse models.
■Antivenin is most effective if given early.
■ Antivenin is indicated if puncture wounds are discovered, the snake bite was wit-
nessed, or an animal displays suspect clinical signs and companion animal-snake
interaction is possible in the region.
 Coral snake antivenin is produced by inoculating horses with venom of the Eastern
coral snake. Like crotalid antivenin the final coral snake antivenin is rich in equine
proteins responsible for allergic reactions.
■Antivenin is diluted (one vial in 100-200 ml) into crystalloid fluids and given slowly
over 30 to 60 minutes while monitoring to prevent an allergic reaction.
■ The amount of antivenin needed is calculated relative to the amount of venon
injected and the body mass of the victim.
■Smaller patients require higher doses of antivenin since the dose of venom per kilo-
gram of body weight of the victim is higher.
■ One vial of coral snake antivenin neutralizes 2 mg of coral snake venom.
Recommended initial dose of antivenin is one to two vials.
■ Antivenin should never be injected into the bite. Uptake of antivenin can be delayed
up to 12 hours when given intramuscularly.
The most common reaction to antivenin is an anaphylactoid response. This reaction
can be treated by administration of diphenhydramine and stopping the antivenin
infusion.
 True anaphylaxis must be treated with epinephrine, corticosteroids, crystalloid
fluids, and stopping the antivenin infusion.
 Antibiotic therapy following coral snake envenomations has fallen out of practice.
However, the wide range of pathogenic bacteria found in the mouths of snakes would
plead for the use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic
■ Corticosteroid administration is not recommended in the treatment of coral snake
envenomation.
no antivenin is available for this venom.
■ Sonoran coral snake bite victims are treated supportively and symptomatically.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ The most effective preventative effort in diminishing numbers of coral snake bite is
companion animal avoidance of prime snake habitat in endemic regions
■ Cats should be kept indoors in areas of known coral snake populations
 Dogs should never be left unsupervised or running loose in areas known to be home
to coral snakes.
752 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ In areas of high snake density often classes are given to train dogs to avoid snakes
and snake contacts
■ Rodents can be removed from houses, garages, shed, and yards in an attempt to
prevent snakes from being attracted to human habitations and biting companion
animals.
■ Client education to alert owners to the signs and appearance of snake bite
envenomation.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Prognosis is closely dependent upon the length of time between time of bite and
initiation of treatment. Also the size of the snake, the size and species of the victim.
and the site of the bite must also be evaluated when considering outcome. The prog-
nosis for all cats is guarded unless early, effective treatment is initiated.

Snake Bite-Pit Vipers
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Of over 120 species of snakes found in North America, 20 species are venomous.
Venomous snakes in North America can be divided into two families: Crotalidae (pit
vipers, including rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths [water moccasins])
and Elapidae (i.e., coral snakes).
■  Far and away the group responsible for both the greatest number of bites and the
most serious bites are members of the family Crotalidae. Each year 99 percent of
snake bites in the United States are initiated by crotalids
1 It is estimated that 150,000 dogs and cats are bitten each year in the United States
by rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water moccasins.
Natural History
 Crotalidae are known as "pit vipers" because they possess a specialized, heat-sensing
facial "pit" that aids them in locating and obtaining warm-blooded prey.
1 In addition to the bilateral heat-sensitive pits between the eyes and nostrils, pit vipers
display retractable fangs, elliptical pupils, triangular-shaped heads, and a single rov
of subcaudal scales caudal to the vent.
■ There are three genera of Crotalidae in the United States, Crotalus (rattlesnakes),
and water moccasins).
Venomous snakes are found in every state in the United States except Maine, Alaska,
and Hawaii.
 Rattlesnakes do not always rattle before striking. Rattlesnakes can strike approxi-
mately one half their body length.
■ Pit vipers can meter the amount of venom they release in a bite. "Offensive” bites
bites delivered by dying snakes can release all the venom they possess.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■  Pit viper venom is a complex mixture of bioactive enzymes and peptides
753
■ Hyaluronidase (spreading factor) and collagenase aid in spreading venom through
interstitial spaces.
■ Proteases lead to coagulopathies and necrosis.
■ Phospholipases cause cytotoxic effects that lead to inflammation and endothelial cell
death.
■ Pit viper venom increases the permeability of capillary cell membranes. Damage to
the microvasculature allows erythrocytes and plasma to escape, resulting in both
edema and ecchymosis.
■ Plasma loss to edema and third spacing can result in hypotension.
  Enzymes and proteins in snake venoms can result in coagulopathy. Fibrinolytics and
thrombin-like enzymes in venom result in depletion of fibrin and fibrinogen,
decreased ability to form intravascular clots, elevated fibrin degradation products,
and prolonged clotting tests.
■ Snakebite coagulopathy is unique and differs from other forms. Unlike true DIC, pit
viper coagulopathies have normal antithrombin and factor Xlll levels.
 Thrombocytopenia is common in pit viper envenomations and is the result of phos-
pholipase damaging platelet membranes triggering their destruction, venom-initiated
platelet aggregation, and platelet consumption by inflammation at bite site.
■ Renal failure can be seen secondary to crotalid envenomation. It is the result
of hypotension, circulatory collapse, and toxic nephropathy of degratory
by-products.
■Neurotoxicity is primarily seen in envenomation by the Elapidae but neurological
signs can be seen in bites by the Mojave rattlesnake (Crotaits scuttiatus) of the
southwestern United States. Other snakes may also possess some neurotoxic
activity.
■  The bite of young snakes is toxic; young snakes are reported to have higher percent-
ages of toxic fractions. However, adult snakes inject larger amounts of venom.
Toxic Dose
■ The amount of venom injected varies with the age, size, species, and motivation of
 the snake. Eastern and western diamondback venom yields can be as high as 800 mg
whereas copperheads may yield only 40 mg.
  In general, rattlesnakes are more toxic than water moccasins (cottonmouths) which
 are more potent than copperheads.
■ In terms of the LD50 for rodents, the Mojave rattlesnake has the most toxic venom
(although larger snakes and larger species release more venom).
■ Pit viper bite severity is related to the volume and toxicity of the venom injected
the location of the bite on the victim, and the rate of its uptake.
■Victim-associated factors determining bite severity include: size of the victim, time
elapsed between bite and initiation of treatment, and victim activity after bite occurs
(activity increases venom absorption).
SNAKE BITE—PIT VIPERS
755
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ In dogs, the majority of bites occur on the head and face. In cats, bites occur to the
thorax, abdomen and paws.
■ The hallmark of crotalid envenomation is intense, rapid swelling (Figures 98.1 and
98.2). A bite can be considered “dry" if there are no signs after l hour.
■ Clinical signs include fang marks, swelling, edema and considerable pain at the site.
Other signs may include erythema, petechia, ecchymosis, and tissue necrosis.
 The signs of a localized bite can progress to systemic signs of vomiting, depression,
respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, fever, and coagulation abnormalities.
Bites to the tongue can be particularly insidious.
 Fang marks can be quite inconspicuous and covered with fur.
Swelling can be intense and is not merely edema, but is caused by extravacularized
blood seeping from damaged blood vessel walls.
Intense swelling can interfere with breathing and with swallowing. Animals may
salivate profusely.
 Clinical signs general appear within 1 to 3 hours and progress rapidly.
Tissue around the bite may quickly become badly bruised; swelling worsens the first
24 hours and may slough or ooze dark, watery blood.
 Cats have been reported to be more resistant (on a milligram of venom to a kilogram
of body weight basis) to pit viper venom than dogs. However, cats are typically

presented to hospitals in a more advanced clinical condition. Also, the severity of
the bite is almost always inversely related to the victim's size.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Differential diagnoses for pit vipers include: trauma, angioedema from arthropod
bites or stings, other animal bite wounds, draining abscesses, and penetrating
wounds.
DIAGNOSTICS

envenomation has occurred and no way to measure the degree of that envenomation.
Diagnosis must be based on history (knowledge of snakes in that area) and clinical
signs.
■ After envenomation laboratory abnormalities include echinocytosis, thrombocytope
nia, anemia, hemoconcentration, elevated fibrin split products, hypofibrinogenemia,
leukocytosis, and prolonged clotting times.
■Serial blood tests should be performed to monitor coagulopathies.
■ Serum biochemical blood profile abnormalities include azotemia, hypoalbunemia,
hypoproteinemia, and elevated levels of creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase,

membrane projections) has been described following snake bite envenomation in
dogs, cats, and humans. The frequency of echinocyte formation has been reported
to be 89 to 92 percent of dogs following snake bite envenomations.
■  It has been suggested that the presence of echinocytes be used as a matter for enven-
omation in dogs; however, other disease processes can cause echinocytosis.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Any animal suspected of being bitten by a venomous snake should be seen.
■
Treatment interventions to be avoided include: ice, incision and suction, tourniquets
and constriction bands, splints, hot packs, electroshock, and fasciotomy
  Initial laboratory work performed should include: complete blood count (with eryth-
profile (activated clotting time, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time.
fibrinogen level), and a urinalysis. Perform ECG to monitor for arrhythmia.
Clip and prep the affected area gently with an antiseptic solution, measure the cir-
cumference of swollen, bitten area to monitor progress of swelling.
■ Due to the rapid onset of hypotension, victims of pit viper envenomation should
begin to receive intravenous fluids (crystalloids: lactated Ringer's solution of 0.9%
NaCl) upon admission to the hospital (30 ml/lb per day if stable, 90 mllb if in hypo-
volemic shock).
■ Colloids appear adequate and beneficial in maintenance of vascular volume and
colloid oncotic pressure.
pain management.
 The only proven specific therapy against pit viper envenomation is the administration
of antivenin
 Iwo antivenins are currently available in the United States: Antivenin (Crotalidae)
and Polyvalent (ACP-Ft Dodge Animal Health). This antivenin acts by neutralizing
venom in patients via passive immunization of globulins obtained from horses immu-
nized with venom from several of the more common crotalids. The most significant
adverse effect is anaphylaxis secondary to the equine source of the antivenin.
 The second, newer antivenin is Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine: croFab.
FabAV, Protherics, Nashville TN). It is an ovine derived product. Sheep are inocu-
lated with venom from a variety of common crotalids. It is considered five times as
potent as the equine products, appears effective in treatment of crotalid-induced
neurotoxicity, and has fewer cases of anaphylaxis because it does not contain the
complement-binding immunoglobulin portion. It is considerably more expensive
than its equine predecessor and its use may be cost prohibitive.
758 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Antivenin functions best if given as soon after the bite as possible.
■Antivenin does not reverse tissue necrosis once it has occurred but additional damage
can be prevented. Antivenin is extremely effective in reversing venom, induced
thrombocytopenia.
■ Skin testing for allergic reaction to equine antivenin is hard to evaluate because false-
positives and false-negatives occur. Animals may be pretreated with diphenhy-
dramine and monitored for allergic reaction (hyperemia of the inner pinna, pruritis.
fluffing of the tail, etc.) as the product is given. If anaphylactic reactions occur they
can be treated with histamine blockers, systemic corticosteroids, epinephrine and
slowed or discontinued antivenin administration
■ Administration of the equine-derived product involves reconstituting the antivenin,
delivering it into l00 to 200ml of intravenous fluids and administering it slowly
over 30 to 60 minutes while monitoring for anaphylaxis.
■ Antivenin should only be given intravenously and never injected into the bite.
Antivenin uptake is delayed for 12 hours if given intramuscularly.
■ The suggested dose of antivenin is one to five vials IV depending upon the severity
of clinical signs, time since envenomation, size of the bite, and size of the patient.
Studies indicate that smaller patients may require relatively higher dosages. Early
administration of antivenin is more effective and one vial given early may be as effec-
tive as five vials given later.
■ Pain management of snake bite victims is critical. Buprenorphine (0.0l mg/kg IV
every 6 hours) or fentanyl (2-3μg/kg IV then 1-5μg/kg per hour CR1) may be
employed. Monitor closely for respiratory depression.
 Antibiotic therapy following snake bites has fallen into disfavor. However, the wide
range of pathogenic bacteria found in the mouths of snakes are a cause for concern.
In humans and animals, the incidence of secondary wound infection in snake bite
victims is quite low. Although antibiotics may be unnecessary in snake envenom-
ation, they should still be considered until further studies are available. A broad-
spectrum antibiotic would provide best coverage.
 Human studies have failed to document any benefits of corticosteroid administration
in treating snake bite and are not routinely administered. They do not alter the course
of the envenomation and may contribute to sepsis. Nevertheless, many veterinary
researchers continue to advocate their use in anti-inflammatory doses as beneficial
(prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg PO once daily for 5 days maximum).
 The “Extractor," a venom suction device obtaining two atmospheres of suction pres-
sure, is reported to be able to remove 30 percent of the venom if applied for 30
minutes immediately following the bite. Nevertheless, this is a very labor-intensive
endeavor for such a small return.
■ Emergency rooms treating snake bite victims must be prepared to perform urgent
airway management (i.e., endotracheal tubes, tracheotomy kits, oxygen cages) par-
  q  m  a ni   r  a

■ Later surgical debridement and repair of necrotic areas may be required.

COMMENTS
Prevention/Avoidance
 Keep dogs on leashes and closely supervised when in known or prime snake habitat.
■
 Similarly keep cats indoors in areas of high snake density.
In areas of known rattlesnake abundance, snake avoidance classes are often offered
to teach dogs to avoid contact with snakes
■  Dogs do not seem to learn about snakes. Several accounts have been reported of dogs
being bitten in successive years.
■A Crotalus atrox toxoid rattlesnake vaccine (Red Rock Biologics) developed for pro-
phylaxis against rattlesnake bite is now available. Iwo doses are initially given l
month apart followed by a yearly booster. No canine studies on efficacy of this
vaccine have been published and its effectiveness has not been documented. Further
study is necessary before this vaccine can be deemed as effective.
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Prognosis for pit viper bite victims depends on the degree of envenomation, the type
of snake, the location of the bite, and the time elapsed between the envenomation
and initiation of therapy. The sooner emergency intervention is begun and the more
aggressive the management, the better the outcome. Prognosis is worse for animals
with severe hypotension, hematologic complications, and extremely small size.
Nevertheless, if managed vigilantly the vast majority of animal snake bite envenom-
 Severely affected animals may require administration of antivenin. For the most
severely affected, those receiving antivenin have a much higher survival rate than
those not receiving the medication.

Spider Bite-Black Widow
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Over 20,000 spider species are found in North American and all but two are venom-
ous. However, only 50 of these species have fangs capable of penetrating mammalian
skin. Furthermore, the majority of these spiders possess small quantities of venom
and weak delivery systems that limit severe toxicity.
 The majority of spider bites are of no medical consequence or concern. Spider bites
have not been shown to transmit communicable diseases; spider envenomations do
 not generally become secondarily infected; and allergic reaction following a spider
bite is extremely rare.
■ A few species produce much more toxic venoms capable of causing skin lesions.
systemic illness, neurotoxicity, and death.
■ Spider venoms are composed of complex proteins and proteolytic enzymes either
designed to initiate digestion of prey entrapped by web spinners or to incapacitate
prey ambushed by hunting spider.
 In general, hunting spiders such as brown recluse spiders (Loxosceles species), fun-
nel-web spiders (Atrax and Hadronyche species), and South American armed spiders
(Phoeneutria species) have more potent venoms than web spinners, with the notable
exception of widow spiders (Latrodectus species).
■ Some spiders, notably tarantulas, can use hind legs to launch urticating hairs from
their dorsal abdomens to irritate the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes of pursuing
attackers.
■ Some reports state that you are never more than l meter away from a spider
Natural History
■ Widow spiders (Latrodectus species) are found in tropical and temperate latitudes
worldwide (over 40 species identified), and 5 species reside in the United Stated in
every state except Alaska. In the Continental United States the most common widow
spider is Latrodectus mactans (black widow) (Table 99.1).
■ Black widows prefer dark, dry, draffless areas. Preferred habitats include: brick
and rock piles, wood piles, wall crevices, crawl spaces, gas and water meters.

■ The majority of bites in humans occur during the colder months when the spiders
come into human habitations. The rest of the year they live outdoors. These spiders
construct funnel-shaped webs, irregularly shaped with a tattered appearance. They

 Female black widows are larger, darker, and more venomous than the smaller males.
Females have a 30- to 40-mm leg span (male leg span from 16-20 mm), but females
can be as much as 20 times the size of males.
■ Females can be 2 to 2.5cm long and can cause life-threatening envenomations.
Female black widows are dark gray to black and display the characteristic red or
orange hourglass pattern on the ventral surface of her shiny globous black abdomen.
The hourglass becomes more prominent as the spider ages.
■  Immature females are capable of delivering a severe envenomation, lack the typical
swollen abdomen and hourglass of the adult female, and are red, brown, and beige
Immature females may take on the color of their last insert meal.
■ Some females consume male mates after breeding giving the spider its name. Males
rarely bite and their bite is of no medical significance.
■ Black widow females are shy, non-aggressive, and retreat from drafts and large cur-
rents of air. Nevertheless, females will protect their egg sac and the web. Like the
brown recluse, black widows are fairly long-lived and can live over l year.
■ The five species of widow spiders found in the United States include L. bishopi
L. geometricus, L. hesperus, L. variolus, and L. mactans. The name Latrodectus mactans
means“sneaky biter.”
■It should be remembered that spider bites can occur well outside the normal range.
 due to travel, commerce, and the innate ability of spiders to stow away.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■ Black widows (Lactrodectus species) produce one of the most potent venoms by
volume.
SPIDER BITE—BLACK WIDOW763
 Through striated muscle control, these spiders can meter the amount of venom they
inject with each bite. It has been estimated that 15 percent of bites are non-
envenomating (dry).
1 Clinical signs (Latrodectism) from black widow bites are caused by a neurotoxic
component of the venom, alpha-latrotoxin. This molecule causes massive presynap-
tic release of most neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, norepinepherine, dopa-
mine, and glutamate.
 The alpha-latrotoxin targets the presynaptic neuronal membrane, which leads to the
massive release of both calcium-dependent (catecholamines) and calcium-indepen-
dent (aceytylcholine, GABA, and glutamate) neurotransmitters
  It appears to do this through formation of stable transmembrane pores, which allow
calcium influx into the presynaptic nerve terminal.
■  Initially stimulatory to end-plate action potentials, the neurotoxin later blocks neu-
rotransmission through depletion of synaptic vesicle contents and then subsequent
inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake.
1
 Black widow spider venom is a primary neurotoxin; it contains no locally active
peptides that provoke an inflammatory action at the site of envenomation.
Toxic Dose
■ As opposed to the brown recluse spider, people report that the bite of the black
widow spider is moderately painful.
1
 Black widow spider venom on a volume-to-volume basis is 100 times more potent
than the venom of a pit viper. Fortunately, because their prey objects are primarily
small insects only a small amount of venom is injected with each bite
 It appears venom toxicity is increased in areas of higher environmental temperature
and in bites occurring in the fall.
■ For companion animals, a single bite can deliver a lethal envenomation
 The brown widow (L. geometricus) has the most potent venom. The LD50 is 0.43 mg/
kg body weight. The LD50 of the black widow is 1.39 mg/kg. The toxic fraction of
the venom appears to be the same for the entire genus but varies in volume percent-
age between species.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Clinical signs of latrodectism develop within 30 minutes to a few hours following
the bite.
 Local tissue changes around the bite are absent or mild, swelling is uncommon, and
a mild erythema may develop, which is easily missed due to tissue pigmentation and
dense coats.
 More severe systemic manifestations depend on: size of the spider, motivation of the
spider (how much venom injected), and time of year (altered venom potency). Alsc
the location of the bite, the size, age, species, and general health of the spider's victim
all contribute to the possible severity of the bite.

 Dogs and cats show severe pain, muscle cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors
(Table 98.2), and abdominal rigidity without tenderness.
■Respiratory distress may become evident and if death occurs it is usually due to
respiratory collapse.
■ Cats are extremely susceptible to the venom of black widow bites. Painful howling
and vocalization can progress to ataxia and paralytic signs. Rhabdomyolysis and
seizures are rare. Rarely are the small bite wound punctures identified.
■ Envenomated animals can lose as much as 20 percent of their body weight in the
first 24 hours following the bite.
■ The muscle spasms, cramping, and abdominal rigidity are thought to be due to the
massive release of neurotrasmitters and an influx of sodium. Deaths can occur in
cats, in smaller animals, and in compromised or debilitated animals.
 Rarely is the spider seen. Animals may vomit up the culprit spider. In our practice,
 a dead black widow was found between the lip and gingiva in a cat displaying signs
similar to latrodectism.
■ In one study, 20 of 22 cats envenomated by black widows died as a result of the bite.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
  Differential diagnoses for black widow spider bites include acute abdomen, back pain
from intervertebral disk disease, marijuana intoxication, bromethalin toxicity, maca-
 damia nut poisoning, and various drug toxicities.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ At present there is no diagnostic test for the presence of black widow venom.
■ Unless the owners saw the spider, a history is generally not helpful in matching
clinical signs to a cause.

behavior sometimes associated with brown recluse bites.
On complete blood count, black widow envenomations typically display a
leukocytosis.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Historically, a variety of treatments have been tried for black widow spider enven-
omations. Muscle relaxants, intravenous calcium gluconate, opioids and Latrodectus-
specific antivenin have all been employed.
■ Local wound care of Latrodectus bites should include: thorough wound cleansing.
pain management, and an initial complete blood count and serum biochemistry
profile. Urinalysis is recommended.
■Although calcium gluconate has been recommended in the past it has been shown
to be ineffective for pain relief when compared to opiods, benzodiazepines, and
Latrodectus antivenin.
■ Latrodectus antivenin is indicated in patients manifesting severe regional or systemic
toxicity and for animals displaying hypertension, seizures, or impending respiratory
arrest.
■ The older Latrodectus antivenin was produced from horses and could cause serum
sickness, anaphylaxis, and death. The newer, purified Fab-fragment antivenins are
now available in South America and Australia and have been shown to rarely cause
immunologic complications.
 In the United States, antivenin is available, (Lyovac [Lactrodectus] antivenin, equine
origin, Merck Sharpe and Dohme), but it should be reserved for severe envenom-
ations. One vial is generally sufficient. Risk of allergic reaction to antivenin can be
diminished by a pretreatment intradermal skin test of the antivenin or pretreatment
injection of diphenhydromine (2-4 mg/kg SQ). Antivenin provides the fastest, most
effective relief to the more severely affected individuals.
■If antivenin is not available, animals should be treated with aggressive wound man-
agement, intravenous fluids, and a combination of opioids and benzodiazepines for
pain management.
COMMENTS
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Spider bites can be prevented in domestic animals by providing a clean, safe, hygienic
environment. Clearing all litter and yard debris, restricting animals from woodpiles
regular household cleaning all cut down on prime spider habitat. Not allowing
animals unsupervised access to sheds, garages, attics, and basements can also reduce
the number of bites. Finally, properly insulating houses, especially all windows.
exterior doors, attics, and basement crawl spaces and by sealing all cracks and leaks
with insulation material will do much to diminish spider numbers.

Spider Bite-Brown
Spiders
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
There are more than 30,o00 species of spider worldwide, most of which are
venomous.
 Most spiders cannot deliver serious bites due to delicate mouth parts and tiny fangs.
 Approximately 200 species from 20 genera worldwide can inflict severe envenom-
ations on humans and animals causing discomfort, neurotoxicity, systemic toxicity.
dermonecrosis, and death.
 The most medically important groups of biting spiders include the widow spiders
(Latrodectus species), the recluse spiders (Loxosceles species), and two spiders con-
fined to single countries: The Australian funnel web spider (Atrax and Hadronyche
species) and the armed or banana spider (Phoneutria species) from Brazil (Table
100.1).
■ Spider bites have not been shown to transmit communicable diseases and rarely
trigger an allergic reaction.
 The collective term arachnidism is used to refer to envenomating spider bites; this
includes all arachnids (i.e., scorpions, etc.). Envenomating spider bites are more
correctly termed araneism. Spider bites can further be classified by systemic mani-
festations, such as necrotic araneism (for Loxosceles bites) and lactrodectism (for
Lactrodectus or widow spider bites).
■ Other species commonly implicated in the United States include Cheirucanthium
spiders and Tegenaria species or hobo spiders.
■ Some reports state that you are never more than l meter away from a spider
Natural History
  Loxosceles spiders are the only globally distributed arachnid capable of causing nec-
rotizing skin lesions.
 At least six species of Loxosceles in the United States are of medical importance.
These include: L. reclusa, L. laeta, L. arizonica, L. deserta, L. devia, and L. rufescens.
Other endemic Loxosceles spiders have minimal human and animal contact.
 All Loxosceles spiders are brown and aside from brown recluse have unique, identify
ing markings.
 Female brown recluse spiders are typically larger than males (20-30-mm leg span to
a l0-35-mm leg span), are more venomous, and fawn to brown with an even darker

distinctive pattern on the cephalothorax. In brown recluse females the unique pattern
resembles a violin, fiddle, or cello with the base toward the head and the neck of the
instrument pointed toward the abdomen. This design is the source of the name
"fiddleback” spider.
 Loxosceles spiders are active at night and prefer warmer climates, with the majority
of reported bites in the United States occurring south of Interstate 80.
■ Loxosceles spiders are shy, build messy webs, and prefer dark, warm places such as
rock piles, wood piles, attics, basements, closets, sheds, and trash receptacles.
■ In humans, brown spider bites are reported to be initially painless or mildly stinging.
This may be because bites most commonly occur at night and might not be felt by
the sleeping victim.
■ Most bites occur when the spider is trapped between the victim and clothing or
bedding or are laid on.
Pathogenesis
 Loxosceles venom acts through a number of pathways and mediators. Sometimes it
The primary cytotoxic agent of Loxosceles venom has been identified as sphingomy-
elinase D, which activates complement, polymorphonuclear cells, and platelets
■Hyaluronidase is also present and responsible for the spread of the lesion with gravity
(a characteristic of Loxosceles envenomation).
SPIDER BITE—BROW/N SPIDERS769
The remainder of the venom is composed of alkaline phosphatase, a variety of pro-
teases, collagenase, esternase, ribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease.
  Dermal histopathology of experimentally envenomated rabbits demonstrated edema
of dermal endothelial cells, endothelial thickening, deposition of intravascular fibrin
and infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly polymorphonucleocytes.
Brown spider venom disrupts connective tissue basement membrane, stimulates
granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor.
 All these substances amplify the inflammatory response accounting for the severe
local reaction.
■ Studies in humans and rabbits reveal that Loxosceles venom induces intravenous
clotting, causing occlusion of dermal venules and arterioles adding to tissue hypoxia
resulting in tissue necrosis.
■ In particular, sphingomyelinase-D has been shown to induce platelet aggregation,
consequent microvascular thrombosis, subsequently followed by ischemia and tissue
necrosis. Sphingomyelinase-D makes up about 0.02 percent of the venom
The rare deaths reported from systemic illness result from disseminated intravascular
necrosis and renal failure. Renal injuries result from Loxosceles toxins binding to
glomerular and tubule cells
Toxic Dose
 Loxosceles species vary in venom strength and vary with the size and sex of the spider
involved. A full envenomation can deliver up to 0.07 mg of venom. A single bite can
be lethal. Loxosceles venom acts through multiple pathways and mediators usually
resulting in a painful bite area, sometimes producing a dermonecrotic lesion and
occasionally causing severe systemic illness. It has been postulated that the systemic
form and rare deaths are the result of renal failure and hemolysis. The degree of
hemolysis can be profound. A lack of hemolysis essentially rules out systemic
involvement.
0
CLINICALFEATURES
 The initially relatively painless or mildly stinging bite is followed within 2 to 8 hours
by painful blistering with surrounding erythema.
■ The initial lesion progresses to one with a central darkness heralding pending necro-
sis surrounded by concentric edema ("bull's eye" or “target sign") within 24 to 48
hours.
■ After 72 hours the lesion ulcerates in an eccentric pattern with eschar formation,
slow healing, and scarring over the following weeks. In humans and rabbits, 15 days
is average healing time.
■One hallmark of Loxosceles bites is this eschar thickens below the surface of the skin
as opposed to other inflammation, infections, and non-spider-bite lesions, which
raise above surrounding skin.

 Systemic illness is the most serious form of "loxoscelism," involving hemolytic anemia
disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia and renal failure; however,
this form is rare in both humans and animals bitten by brown spiders in North
America.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
1 Ulcerating or necrotic wounds from a myriad of other insect-induced, infectious or
physical sources are often misdiagnosed as brown spider bites.
■ Causes of lesions that mimic dermonecrotic spider bites include thermal burns,

mediated, zinc toxicity, onion poisoning) and fever of unknown origin.
tive” diagnosis (Table 100.2).
DIAGNOSTICS
■Concrete diagnosis of Loxosceles spider bites is confounded by several factors includ-
ing the extensive diagnosis of dermal bite-like lesions, suspected versus definite
spider bites (eyewitnesses), and precise identification of the biting spider by
arachnidologists.
■ Anatomic location of spider bites appears to be far more dependent on the activity
of the victim at the time of the bite rather than on the spider's typical behavior.
preferred habitats. or feeding habits. Thus location of a spider bite is
nondiagnositic.
SPIDER BITE—BROWN SPIDERS
771
The diagnosis of brown recluse bites is frequently overused for dermonecrotic lesions
of uncertain etiology. especially for locations in the United States where the spider
is not even endemic.
Factors affecting the severity of the bite include the sex of the spider, the size of the
spider, and the size of the prey.
Early attempts to diagnose brown spider envenomation involved passive hemagglu-
tination inhibition tests measuring the venom's ability to inhibit the agglutination of
venom sensitized erythrocytes. In guinea pigs, the test has 90 percent sensitivity and
100 percent specificity when conducted within 3 days of envenomation. The test is
■ The most accurate diagnostic test for Loxosceles envenomation is detection of either
the venom itself or circulating antibodies to the venom.
Sensitive Loxosceles species venom enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been
developed for a variety of brown spiders but is not in widespread clinical use. No
commercial tests are currently available in the United States.
■ Another promising Loxosceles venom specific immunoassay being developed uses
hair, skin biopsies, or tissue aspirates near a suspected lesion to detect the presence
of venom up to7 days post-envenomation. Presently this immunoassay likewise is
not commercially available.
 Lymphocyte transformation has also been shown to be a specific indicator for enven-
omation, but it too is prohibitively labor intensive and costly.
■ Although a variety of tests are promising, currently there is no gold standard diag-
nostic test for Loxosceles envenomation available in the United States.
THERAPEUTICS
 A definitive therapeutic approach to loxoscelism has yet to be established.
 A variety of interventions have been proposed including: dapsone, colchicine, surgi-
cal excision, steroids, and hyperbaric oxygen.
 The theoretical mechanism of action of polymorphonuclear cell inhibitors (such as
dapsone and colchicine) is that they halt expanding dermonecrosis through inhibi-
tion of leukocyte migration, degranulation, and cytokine release.
  The effectiveness of leukocyte inhibitors such as dapsone has not been supported by
clinical trials and poses a substantial risk of toxicity.
One of the first interventions for cutaneous brown spider bites was surgical debride-
ment and skin grafting. However, early surgical management has been found to be
ineffective and often even harmful as an initial management.
Spider bite wounds may take several days to weeks for the lesion to finally declare
itself and demonstrate the area of necrosis and tissue destruction.
1 In humans, only 3 percent of cutaneous loxoscelism victims require surgery or skin
grafting and this usually because the lesion is greater than 2 cm or underlying prob
lems such as peripheral vascular disease or diabetes mellitus impede primary healing
The majority of Loxosceles envenomations result in little more than a mild inflam
matory reaction. There is insufficient data to merit the use of corticosteroids for
brown spider bites but the theoretical mechanism behind their use would be their
immunosuppressive action blunting the response of the immune system to the bite.
However, this type of beneficial activity has not been confirmed in clinical cases.
■Another possible intervention used in treatment of brown spider bites is the applica-
tion of hyperbaric oxygen. The proposed mechanism of this treatment is the promo-
tion of neovascularization and increased oxygen availability to ischemic tissue.
■ Sphingomyelinase activity of the venom is not inhibited by hyperbaric oxygen and
the majority of studies in animals showed no reduction in the amount of necrosis
or lesion site. At present, there is no conclusive evidence to support the use of
hyperbaric oxygen in treatment of loxoscelism.
■ One study claimed hyperbaric oxygen therapy to be effective if administered within
6 hours of the envenomation. However, the majority of brown spider bites on animals
are not recognized or treated until after 6 hours of the bite.
■ The most important and effective intervention may be wound irrigation and aggres-
sive wound management. Theoretically, the application of ice decreases damage and
inflammation and prevents venom spread through vasoconstriction. Immobilization
is also believed to decrease tissue loss but neither ice nor immobilization treatment
efficacy has been confirmed in clinical studies
■ The application of heat and electric shock therapy of bitten areas have been shown
to delay healing in animal studies
■ Topical application of nitroglycerin has been reported to decrease wound size, but
controlled animal studies found no significant impact on lesion size using topical
nitroglycerin at the envenomation site.
■ Early Loxosceles bites are often diagnosed as infections explaining the widespread
use of antibiotics. In humans, necrotic lesions generally are treated with antibiotics.
Nevertheless, some authors believe that antibiotic coverage for a straightforward
necrotic ulceration after brown spider envenomation is both unnecessary and
inappropriate.
 There are four sources of Loxosceles antivenins, none of which are available currently
in the United States. In Brazil, the antivenin is used in bites with large cutaneous
lesions, extensive necrosis, and systemic illness. Depending on how soon it is admin-
istered it has been shown to decrease severity of reaction and shorten healing time
Nevertheless, in most animal species bite victims there is significant delay betweer
the actual bite and presentation for treatment, which may diminish antivenin effec-
tiveness. If animals present within 6 hours of envenomation spider bites may be more
amenable to such interventions.
■ Systemic loxoscelism is very rare and may be due to decreased renal function.
Furthermore, secondary infections are most common in immunocompromised or
diabetic animals. Animals displaying systemic signs should be hospitalized and intra-
venous fluids initiated to maintain hydration and protect renal function
■ In humans, wound care alone including debridement of necrotic tissues, culture-
directed antibiotic therapy of secondary infections, and delayed assessment and
SPIDER BITE—BROW/N SPIDERS773
incision of eschars has proven to be a successful strategy. With proper wound man-
agement, brown spider envenomations heal within 1 to 8 weeks with a 10 percent
chance of significant permanent scarring.
COMMENTS
Prevention/Avoidance
 The shy nature of Loxosceles species and a high tolerance to pesticides make exter-
mination of the spider difficult. In addition, distribution of pesticides in households
rarely reaches under the rocks and into woodpiles where brown spiders live.
Furthermore, Loxosceles species do not have the foot pads through which other
arachnids absorb pesticides. Multiple formulas have been tried but the brown
spiders have shown resistance to most, even to exposure to dichlorodiphenyl-
trichloroethane.
■ Peak period of envenomation is the summer time.
■ Bites often occur in beds when people and animals roll over on the spider during
sleep.
■
Cleaning dark, unused areas of the house decreases spider habitat.
■]
Decreasing insects that are the prey of the spider is another good preventative
measure
 Pulling beds away from walls is yet another good preventative.
■All suspected biting spiders should be brought in for identification by an expert so
 e  e      sn 
■Animals should not be confined to areas of prime spider habitat.
Expected course and Prognosis
■The treatment of brown spider envenomation continues to be hampered by the time-
dependent nature of cellular damage. Nevertheless, the window of opportunity for
effective treatment may be longer than previously thought.
 Early and aggressive wound management may be the most effective intervention.
 Dermonecrotic wounds of uncertain origin are often attributed to a brown spider
bite. Thus such bites are overdiagnosed including areas where the spiders are rare
or not even found. Misdiagnosis of these wounds can lead to delays in appropriate
care, adverse outcomes, and increased medical legal risk, particularly if there is spe-
cific treatment for the actual underlying condition.
1The majority of brown recluse bites heal uneventfully in l to 3 weeks. A small per
centage may require surgical intervention and result in significant scarring. An even
smaller number of bites lead to systemic illness and even more rarely death. So the
overall outcome of brown spider bites is favorable

Spinal Shock
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
The loss of muscle tone and segmental spinal reflexes caudal to a severe spinal cord
injury
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Acute spinal cord trauma—usually a solitary lesion; however, spinal shock can give
the appearance of a multifocal lesion
■Poorly understood in companion animals—likely a sudden interruption in descend-
ing supraspinal input
Should be suspected with flaccid paralysis and sudden return of reflexes in a quicker
than expected recovery period
■May only last 30 to 60 minutes
Systerms Affected
■ Nervous—lesion localization is initially difficult to establish; loss of reflexes and
muscle tone caudal to an acute spinal cord injury with rapid return of reflexes
■ Musculoskeletal—paralysis, decreased muscle tone
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■ Dogs and cats—rare; likely underreported
Historical Findings
Trauma—hit by car most common
■Unknown—acute paralysis or neurologic signs
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Initial physical and neurologic examination should be conducted prior to analgesia
and sedation.

■Flaccid paralysis—-below the lesion
■Flaccid bladder with urinary retention
■ Neurologic examination may suggest multiple lesions; subsequent examinations

Pathologic Findings

THERAPEUTICS
Surgical emergency
 Anesthesia—avoid barbiturates, acepromazine, or other drugs that can cause splenic
congestion
 Surgery-—After adequate cardiovascular stabilization, a splenectomy should be per-
formed without untwisting the splenic pedicle (Figure 103.4).
 Derotation of an acute torsion without splenectomy might be possible but is not
recommended.
■ Avoid ligation of pancreatic vascular supply by vessel ligation close to the spleen.
The vascular pedicle cannot be untwisted in the chronic form due to fibrosis, throm-
bosis, and risk of splenic rupture.
 A permanent gastropexy may also be performed concurrently in a stable patient
because of the association with GDV syndrome.
 Submit a portion of the spleen for histopathologic examination.

Supraventricular
Tachycardia (sVT)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Repetitive supraventricular premature depolarizations that originate from a site other
than the sinus node, such as the atrial myocardium or atrioventricular nodal tissue
Electrocardiogram Features
     s       1   
depends on the size of the patient. Smaller dogs typically have higher sinus nodal
rates than larger dogs.
■ Rhythm usually very regular (R-R interval is constant) and may be sustained, but
there can be frequent or infrequent short runs of SVT, so-called paroxysmal SVT.
Rarely, the rhythm during the tachycardia will be irregular, suggesting abnormal
automaticity as the etiology (Figure 104.1).
■ Usually the QRS complexes are typical of normal sinus complexes, narrow with a
normal mean electrical axis. In some cases a coexisting bundle branch block or aber
rant ventricular conduction makes it difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate an
SVT from a ventricular tachycardia by examining the ECG.
1  P waves can be normal or abnormal and typically differ in configuration from the
sinus P waves. P waves may be buried in the previous T wave and therefore not
visualized.

congenital accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles that allows the electri-
cal impulses to travel freely between the atria and ventricles without traversing the
AV node and without conduction delay; in these patients, the SVT is caused by
reentry through the accessory pathway and the AV node.

■ CHF may develop secondary to progressive myocardial failure associated with a
chronically high heart rate (so called tachycardia-induced myocardial failure).

■Syncope or generalized episodic weakness due to reduced cardiac output and oxygen
delivery
Genetics
■ Labrador retrievers are suspected, on the basis of clinical data, to have a genetic
predisposition to congenital accessory pathway.

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Species
■ Dogs and rarely cats
Breed Predilections
■ Labrador retrievers are overrepresented in the literature.
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Heart disease
■ Genetics in Labrador retrievers
Historical Findings
■ Owners are generally unaware of the arrhythmia.
Coughing or breathing abnormalities in dogs with CHF
 Episodic weakness or syncope
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Abnormalities noted on physical examination.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■
Sinus tachycardia
■ Atrial flutter
■ Atrial fibrillation
Ventricular tachycardia (SVT with right bundle branch block or aberrant conduction
can look like ventricular tachycardia; resolution of arrhythmia after lidocaine admin-
istration usually confirms ventricular tachycardia)
Physical Examination Findings
 Rapid, usually regular heart rhythm. However, in dogs with paroxysmal SVT the
rhythm may be normal and regular during the physical examination.
  s    d o    s
longed capillary refill time, and weak pulses
May have no signs other than the rapid heart rate
Findings may reflect an underlying cardiac condition (e.g., heart murmur).
DIAGNOSTICS
Imaging
■ Echocardiography (including Doppler studies) may help characterize the type and
severity of underlying cardiac disorders. Echocardiography is also important for
assessing myocardial function in patients with idiopathic SVT.
■ When viewed on an echocardiogram during bursts of SVT, the left ventricle has a
normal end-systolic diameter and a small end-diastolic diameter, resulting in a
decreased shortening fraction because of inadequate filling.
■  Usually left or right atrial enlargement in dogs with SVT secondary to other cardiac
disorders
Diagnostic Procedures
■ Long-term ambulatory (Holter) recording of the ECG may detect paroxysmal SVT
in cases of unexplained syncope. This is generally only helpful if the syncope is
occurring regularly within a 24- to 48-hour period. Holter monitors may also help
characterize the rate and frequency of sustained SVT and are useful in evaluating the
efficacy of therapy.
■ Event (Loop) recorders may detect paroxysmal SVT in patients with infrequent epi-
sodes of syncope (< every 24-48 hours).
  Sustained SVT must be distinguished from sinus tachycardia because the two arrhyth-
mias have different implications and treatment. A precordial thump may help dif-
ferentiate sinus tachycardia from SVT when the heart rate is in the 150 to 250
beats-per-minute range; it will usually stop an SVT for at least l or 2 beats, while a
sinus tachycardia will not slow. A vagal maneuver (e.g., ocular pressure or carotid
sinus massage) may break an SVT abruptly but only gradually slows sinus
tachycardia.
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of choice
Emergency Therapy
■Administer one of the following drugs:
■ Calcium channel blockers: verapamil (0.05 mg/kg boluses IV over 3-5 minutes up
to three times) or diltiazem (0.05-0.25 mg/kg IV over 5-15 min)
■β-Adrenergic blockers: esmolol (0.25-0.5 mg/kg slow IV bolus administration fol-
lowed by a constant-rate infusion of 50-200 μg/kg per minute); moderate-to-severe
myocardial failure is a relative contraindication to the administration of these drugs
at these doses.
■ Electrical cardioversion or intracardiac electrophysiologic pacing methods may be
considered in extreme cases.
SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)797
Long-TermTherapy
■ Digoxin: administer at either a maintenance oral dose or double the maintenance
dose for the first day to produce a therapeutic serum concentration more rapidly:
β-Adrenergic blocker; atenolol (0.2-l mg/kg PO every 12 to 24 hours) can be admin-
istered as long as the patient does not have underlying moderate-to-severe myocar-
dial failure.
  Diltiazem is the calcium channel blocker of choice for long-term control of SVT. The
dosage required to control SVT has not been reported in the dog. Diltiazem is used
more frequently to control the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation at
a dosage of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg PO every 8 hours. Generally start in this dosage range
but almost always increase the dose to 2.0 to 3.0 mg/kg PO every 8 hours to effect
control of SVT.
  Class I antiarrhythmic agents such as quinidine and procainamide can be tried when
the aforementioned drugs are ineffective or when the SVT is thought to be due to
an automatic, rather than a reentrant, rhythm. SVT caused by an automatic atrial
 focus may produce an irregular rhythm and may be refractory to conventional drug
therapy. When the SVT is due to an accessory pathway, these drugs are more
effective.
Precautions/Interactions
■Calcium channel blockers and β-adrenergic blockers have negative inotropic proper-
ties and should be used cautiously in dogs with documented myocardial failure
Alternative Drugs
■ Emergency treatment: intravenous adenosine (1-l2 mg IV rapidly). Adenosine is
very expensive and short lived; propranolol (0.02 mg/kg slow intravenous boluses
up to a total dose of 0.l mg/kg). Propranolol has a long half-life after intravenous
administration and also has significant β, blocking effects and is generally not recom-
mended unless no other alternative is available.
Diet
■ Mild to moderate sodium restriction if in CHF
Activity
■Restrict until arrhythmia has been controlled
Surgical Considerations
■ Consider transvenous catheter ablation for patients with accessory pathways.
Appropriate Health Care
Asymptomatic patients can be managed on an outpatient basis: patients with a sus
tained SVT or signs of congestive heart failure should be hospitalized until stable.
■ SVT is a medical emergency in dogs that exhibit weakness and collapse; nonphar-
 macologic interventions that may break an SVT include vagal maneuvers, precordial
thump, and electrical cardioversion.
■ Vagal maneuvers are often unsuccessful but may be used initially because of their
ease of administration and noninvasive nature.
■ Delivering a precordial thump can successfully (>90 percent of the time) terminate
an SVT in dogs, but this maneuver may break the rhythm for only a brief period. At
other times the rhythm remains converted. To perform a precordial thump, the dog
is placed on its right side and the left apex beat is located. This region is then
"thumped" with a fist while recording the ECG.
■ Emergency medical therapy is required in patients when a precordial thump is
unsuccessful.
Nursing Care
■ Treat CHF and correct any underlying electrolyte or acid-base disturbances.
COMMENTS
■Clinical signs may relate to the underlying cause.
■ Dogs with slow SVT or infrequent paroxysmal SVT may exhibit no clinical
signs.

Syncope
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■  Temporary loss of consciousness and vascular tone associated with loss of postural
tone, with spontaneous recovery
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■  Inadequate cerebral perfusion, delivery of oxygen, and metabolic substrates lead to
loss of consciousness and motor tone.
 Impaired cerebral perfusion can result from changes in vasomotor tone, cerebral
disease, and low cardiac output caused by structural heart disease or arrhythmias
Risk Factors/Causes
■Heart disease
 Sick sinus syndrome
■]
 Drug therapy: vasodilators (e.g., calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, hydrala-
zine, and nitrates), phenothiazines (e.g., acepromazine), anti-arrhythmics, and
diuretics
Cardiac Causes
 Bradyarrhythmias: sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, second-degree AV block, complete
AV block, atrial standstill
 Tachyarrhythmias: ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and atrial
fibrillation
 Low cardiac output (nonarrhythmic): cardiomyopathy, AV valve endocardiosis, sub-
aortic stenosis, pulmonic stenosis, heartworm disease, pulmonary embolism, cardiac
tumor, or cardiac tamponade
Neurologic and Vasomotor Instability
1  Vasovagal syncope: emotional stress and excitement may cause heightened sympa-
thetic stimulation, leading to transient tachycardia and hypertension, which is fol-
lowed by a compensatory rise in vagal tone, leading to excessive vasodilation without
a compensatory rise in heart rate and cardiac output; bradycardia often occurs.

BLACKWELL'S FVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
■ Situational syncope refers to syncope associated with coughing, defecation, urina-
tion, and swallowing.
■ Carotid sinus hyperactivity may cause hypotension and bradycardia, often the cause
of syncope when one pulls on a dog's collar.
Miscellaneous Causes
 Drugs that affect blood pressure and regulation of autonomic tone
 Hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia (rare)
Hyperviscosity syndromes (e.g. polycythemia and paraproteinemia) cause sludging
of blood and impaired cerebral perfusion (rare).
Systems Affected
■Cardiovascular

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Species
■ Dogs and cats
Breed Predilection
■ Sick sinus syndrome: cocker spaniel, miniature schnauzer, pug, and dachshund
■ Ventricular arrhythmias: boxer and German shepherd
Mean Age and Range
 More common in old animals
Historical Findings
■Acute collapse or weakness
■ Suspected seizure
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Differential Signs
■ Must differentiate from other altered states of consciousness, including seizures and
narcolepsy (a sleep disorder)
without warning. and animal usually has rapid, spontaneous recovery. Unlike
SYNCOPE
syncope, seizure activity is usually associated with tonic-clonic muscle activity rather
than flaccidity.
■ Like syncope, narcolepsy occurs suddenly, results in muscle flaccidity, and resolves
spontaneously. Unlike syncope, narcolepsy can last for minutes and can be termi-
nated by loud noises or harsh external stimuli.
■ Must differentiate from other causes of collapse such as musculoskeletal disease and
neuromuscular disease (e.g., myasthenia gravis), which are not associated with loss
of consciousness.
Differential Causes
Syncope with excitement or stress suggests vasovagal syncope.
Syncope with coughing, urination, or defecation suggests situational syncope.
 Syncope with exercise suggests low output states associated with arrhythmias or
structural heart disease.
■ A murmur supports heart disease but does not confirm cardiac cause for syncope.
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
■Usually normal
■ Hypoglycemia or electrolyte disturbance in some animals
Other Laboratory Tests
■]
 If animal is hypoglycemic, measure insulin concentration on same blood sample.
 Calculate an amended insulin-to-glucose ratio to rule out insulinoma
■ If low cardiac output is suspected, rule out occult heartworm disease.
Imaging
Echocardiography
■ May detect structural heart disease that could lower cardiac output
Diagnostic Procedures
 Have owner monitor heart rate during any syncopal episode.
■ Electroencephalogram, computed tomography of the head, CSF tap if CNS origin
suspected
Electrocardiographic Findings
 Postexercise ECG may reveal intermittent arrhythmia
■ Holter monitoring (24-hour ECG recording) or use of an ECG event (loop) recorder
is useful for evaluating arrhythmic causes.
■Carotid sinus massage with ECG and blood pressure monitoring useful in evaluating
carotid sensitivity
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
Bradyarrhythmias
■Correct metabolic causes
■Anticholinergics (e.g., atropine, propantheline bromide, and hyoscyamine sulfate)
■ Sympathomimetics (e.g., isoproterenol and bronchodilators)
■ Pacemaker implantation in some patients
Tachyarrhythmias
 Atrial dysrhythmias: administer digoxin, β-blocker, or diltiazem
■ Ventricular dysrhythmias: administer lidocaine, procainamide, mexiletine, sotalol,
or β-blocker.
Low Cardiac Output
■ Institute treatment to improve cardiac output, which varies according to specific
cardiac disease.
Vasovagal
 Theophylline or aminophylline is sometimes helpful; mechanism of action in this
setting is unclear
β-blockers (e.g., atenolol, propranolol, and metoprolol) may indirectly prevent vagal
stimulation by blocking the initial sympathetic response.
■ Anticholinergics may blunt the vagal response.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Drugs that lower blood pressure
Surgical Considerations
■ Pacemaker implantation for sick sinus syndrome and advanced AV block and per-
sistent atrial standstill
Appropriate Health Care
Avoid or discontinue medications likely to precipitate syncope.
■ Treat as outpatient unless important heart disease is evident.

Tick Paralysis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ Flaccid, lower motor neuron paralysis caused by salivary neurotoxins from certain
species of female ticks
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1The female tick of multiple species (Dermacentor and Amblyomma in the United
States and Ixodes in Australia) injects salivary neurotoxins that interfere with the
depolarization/acetylcholine release mechanism in the presynaptic nerve terminal.
The Australian Ixodes tick neurotoxin depends strongly on temperature for activation
and effect.
■ Only one adult female Dermacentor or Amblyomma tick is sufficient to cause neuro-
logic signs, but a large larval or nymphal Ixodes tick infestation can also induce signs.
Signs occur 6 to 9 days after initial tick attachment.
■  Not all infested animals develop signs of tick paralysis and not all adult female ticks
produce the neurotoxin.
Systerms Affected
Nervous/Neuromuscular—peripheral nervous system and the neuromuscular junc-
 tion most affected by the neurotoxin; cranial nerves can become involved, including
the vagus, facial, and trigeminal nerves; sympathetic nervous system can also be
affected.
■ Respiratory—may see paralysis of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm; caudal
brainstem respiratory centers may be affected especially  with  Ixodes tick
infestation.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
  In Australia, both dogs and cats are equally affected by the Ixodes neurotoxin.
■ In North America, however, cats appear to be resistant to the Dermacentor and
Amblyommaneurotoxin.
807
Risk Factors/Causes
■ The incidence of tick paralysis is somewhat seasonal, with a greater incidence in the
summer months.
■ In warmer areas (southern United States and northern Australia), tick paralysis is a
year-round problem.
■ The overall incidence of tick paralysis is relatively low in North America with a
■In the United States, D. variabilis has a wide distribution over the eastern two-thirds
of the country and in California and Oregon.
■ D. andersoni, however, is found only from the Cascades to the Rocky Mountains.
■ A. americanum has a southern U.S. distribution from Texas and Missouri to the
Atlantic Coast.
 A. maculatum has even a narrower range. preferring the high temperature and humid-
ity of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico seaboards.
■ In Australia, I. holocyclus is limited to the coastal areas of the east, especially in areas
associated with bush and scrub.
Historical Findings
■ The classic history would be that the patient walked in a wooded area approximately
 1 week prior to the onset of signs.
 Onset of neurological dysfunction is gradual, starting with stumbling and weakness
sd a si o s pi e a a 's rd an 
cranial nerve and autonomic signs.
Neurologic Examination Findings
■ In non-Ixodes ticks, once neurologic signs appear, there is rapid ascending lower
motor neuron paresis to paralysis.
■ Many dogs will become recumbent in 1 to 3 days, with hyporeflexia/areflexia and
hypotonia/atonia.
 Occasionally, signs are much milder, with the dog still able to ambulate.
■ Pain sensation is preserved.
■ Cranial nerve dysfunction is usually not a prominent feature, with the most common
signs being facial weakness and dysphonia.
■Respiratory paralysis is very rare in the United States.
■Urination and defecation are usually normal.
■ With intoxication by the Ixodes tick, the neurologic signs are much more severe and
rapidly progressive.
■The ascending motor paresis can progress to paralysis within a few hours, along with
sialosis, megaesophagus, and vomiting or regurgitation.
static pressure, and pulmonary edema.
TICK PARALYSIS809
1 There is additional involvement of the caudal medullary respiratory centers, which
add to the peripheral pulmonary changes, resulting in a progressive fall in respiratory
rate without a change in tidal volume, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respira-
tory acidosis.
Respiratory muscle paralysis is much more prevalent, with both dogs and cats pro-
gressing to respiratory distress, cyanosis, and respiratory paralysis within 1 to 2 days
if not treated.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■Botulism
■
 Acute polyneuropathy
■
 Coonhound paralysis (acute canine polyradiculoneuritis)
 Distal denervating disease
■Generalized (diffuse) or multifocal myelopathy
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Regular blood work will be normal in animals with tick paralysis.
■]
 In severely affected patients, especially with the Ixodes tick, arterial blood gases will
reveal a low PaO, a high PaCO, and a low pH.
 Thoracic radiographs will be normal in dogs affected by ticks in North America, but
often will reveal a megaesophagus in patients affected by the Ixodes neurotoxin.
Electrodiagnostic evaluation will reveal normal insertion activity and an absence of
spontaneous myofiber activity (no fibrillations and positive sharp waves) on electro-
myography (normal), but motor nerve conduction studies will reveal a significant
decrease or absence of compound muscle potential amplitudes.
THERAPEUTICS
■ If tick paralysis is suspected, the patient should be hospitalized until either a tick is
found and removed or appropriate treatment to kill a hidden tick is performed.
 Thoroughly search for a tick in all body areas including the trunk and limbs, ear
canals, mouth, rectum, vagina, prepuce, and in between the digits and foot pads.
■If a tick is found, it should be immediately removed.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ If the tick cannot be found, use a topical insecticidal product such as Frontline or
dip the patient in an insecticidal bath.
■ With tick paralysis in North America, this is often the only specific treatment
needed.
■With I. holocyclus, circulating toxin must be neutralized via hyperimmune serum
(0.5-l mg/kg IV), depending on the severity of clinical signs.
 If the clinical signs are severe and involve the sympathetic nervous system, phenoxy-
 benzamine, an Q-adrenergic antagonist (1 mg/kg IV diluted in saline and given slowly
 Over 20 minutes), appears to be beneficial.
■ Acepromazine (0.5-l mg/kg IV) can be used as an alternative treatment because it
has an Q-adrenergic blocking effect.
Precautions/Interactions
■ Inpatient supportive care is essential until the patient begins to show signs of
recovery.
■If the patient demonstrates hypoxia or hypoventilation, an oxygen cage should be
used.
■ Assisted ventilation may occasionally be necessary in severe cases, especially with
Ixodes neurotoxicity.
■ Intravenous fluid therapy is generally not required unless recovery is prolonged, the
neurological dysfunction is severe, or there is evidence of megaesophagus
■ Administer intravenous fluids at a very slow rate to avoid further complications of
pulmonary congestion in Ixodes neurotoxicity.
■ Keep the patient in a quiet environment until recovery.
■ The patient with Ixodes neurotoxicity should be housed in a cool, air-conditioned
area because the neurotoxin is temperature sensitive. Avoid activity to prevent any
increase in body temperature.
■ Drugs that interfere with neuromuscular transmission are contraindicated. These
 include tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and procaine penicillin.
 Atropine is contraindicated in the advanced stages of Ixodes neurointoxication or
with marked bradycardia
Diet
■Withhold food and water if the patient has dysphagia or vomiting/regurgitation.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ For non-Ixodes ticks, inform the client that good nursing care is essential, although
the patient's recovery is rapid after removal of the tick.
■ For the Ixodes tick, warn the client that signs often worsen despite tick removal.
Therefore, more aggressive treatment to neutralize the toxin must be undertaken.
TICK PARALYSIS
811
 Patient Monitoring
  For non-Ixodes ticks, you should reassess neurologic status after tick removal at least
48 hours.
■ For the Ixodes tick, you need to monitor neurologic status and respiratory/cardio-
vascular functions continuously and intensively even after tick removal because of
the residual effect of the neurotoxin.
Prevention/Avoidance
 Vigilantly check for ticks after exposure (at least every 2-3 days). Remember that
signs do not occur for 4 to 6 days after tick attachment.
■ Advise the owner to regularly use a topical insecticide or give weekly insecticidal
baths.
 Short-term acquired immunity develops after exposure to the Ixodes neurotoxin.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ For non-Ixodes ticks, prognosis is good to excellent if ticks are removed appropri-
ately, with recovery occurring in 1 to 3 days.
■ Prognosis is often guarded for the Ixodes tick, with a prolonged recovery. If left
untreated, death will usually occur in 1 to 2 days.

Tracheal Collapse
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Tracheal collapse generally refers to a condition of excessive collapsibility of the
trachea.
 A collapsing trachea has a wide, flaccid dorsal tracheal membrane that is redundant
and sags into the lumen; further, weakened cartilaginous rings may form a shallow
arch impinging on the lumen of the trachea.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Tracheal collapse has been associated with other conditions such as tracheal trauma,
intra- and extaluminal masses, and tracheal hypoplasia
 The typical syndrome of tracheal collapse where the trachea is excessively collapsible
has an unclear etiology. Several theories have been proposed including genetic,
nutritional, neurological, and inflammatory causes.
Systems Affected
 Respiratory—Severe tracheal collapse can lead to respiratory distress and hypoxemia
Concurrent bronchitis or pneumonia may be present.
 Cardiovascular—Chronic cough and airway disease can be an underlying cause of
pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
1 Toy and miniature breeds are most commonly affected. Frequently affected breeds
include toy poodle, Yorkshire terrier, Pomeranian, Maltese, pug, and Chihuahua.
 Tracheal collapse is occasionally reported in large breeds, and rarely reported in
cats.
■ Most dogs with tracheal collapse are middle-aged, and the reported average age of
onset is 6.6 to 8 years of age. There is a biphasic age distribution with a subpopula-
tion showing signs of tracheal collapse during puppyhood.
813
814
Historical Findings
■ Cough is the classic historical finding, and it may have been present for several weeks
prior to the client seeking veterinary attention. The cough is often dry, hacking, and
nonproductive; although a terminal retch or a moist cough may be present. The
have been mild but often progresses and there are bouts of severe, paroxysmal cough-
ing episodes.
■ Coughing bouts may be precipitated by excitement or tracheal irritation such as
pulling on a neck leash. Severe cases can suffer respiratory distress at rest, cyanosis.
and collapse. Exercise intolerance may be reported, although this may not be reported
in dogs with a sedentary lifestyle.
■ Up to two-thirds of patients are reported as obese.
■ Gagging after eating or drinking is reported in 30 percent of dogs with tracheal
collapse.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Physical examination findings will vary from an apparently normal dog to findings
of severe, paroxysmal cough with possible cyanosis or collapse.
■ A harsh cough can be easily induced with gentle tracheal palpation. Thoracic aus-
cultation will reveal harsh wheezing sounds in patients with concurrent chronic
bronchitis.
■ Cardiac auscultation is typically normal, although a split S2 from delayed closure of
 the tricuspid valve may be present in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
■ Incidental chronic mitral valve disease and a loud systolic mitral murmur may be
present falsely raising the suspicion of congestive heart failure.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■Chronic bronchitis
Infectious tracheobronchitis
 Tracheobronchial foreign body
 Brachycephalic airway syndrome
■ Congestive heart failure
■Pneumonia
DIAGNOSTICS
Radiography
■Lateral radiographs of the cervical and thoracic regions are commonly obtained in
diagnosing tracheal collapse; dorsoventral flattening of the trachea may be observed.
(Figure 107.1)
TRACHEAL COLLAPSE
815
 Figure 107.1 Lateral thoracic radiograph of a dog with tracheal collapse at the thoracic inlet. Also present
is a redundant dorsal trachealis membrane.
 Reported sensitivity for routine lateral radiographs is reported between 60 and 84
percent; false-negative findings on routine films occur with substantial frequency
 False-positives may also occur with superimposition of overlying structure such as
the esophagus or longus colli or lungus capitis muscles.
Because of the dynamic nature of tracheal collapse, both inspiratory and expiratory
views should be obtained as intrathoracic tracheal collapse will be evident on expira-
tion and cervical tracheal collapse will be evident on inspiration.
■ Alternatively fluoroscopy has the advantage of continuous documentation through
all phases of respiration and is preferred by many clinicians.
 Routine thoracic and cervical radiographs are indicated in patients with cough or
respiratory distress; patients should be medically stabilized prior to obtaining stress.

Tracheobronchscopy
■Advances in fiberoptic and videobronchoscopy have increased the availability of this
technique. Direct tracheal imaging allows visualization of dynamic tracheal lesions.
intraluminal masses, and opportunity to grade the extent of tracheal collapse (i.e.,
 cervical, thoracic, both), and exclude false-positive radiographic findings.
■Tracheal collapse grading system:
■ Grade I: slightly pendulous trachealis muscle with up to 25 percent luminal loss
■ Grade Il: the trachealis muscle is more pendulous and the lumen is reduced by
up to 50 percent.
■ Grade Ill: severe flattening of the cartilaginous rings; the dorsal tracheal mem-
brane is nearly in contact with the opposing wall and there is up to 75 percent
luminal loss.
■ Grade IV: total tracheal collapse; dorsal tracheal membrane lies on the ventral
floor, the lumen is obliterated.
and bronchoscopy as other forms of airway disease may exist concurrently with
 tracheal collapse.
Cytology and Bacteriology
■ Obtaining airway wash samples for cytology and bacteriology is often advocated;
lower tracheal swabs. Common bacteria isolated include alpha-hemolytic strepto-
cocci, Pasteurella multocida, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and coagulase positive staphylo-
cocci. Upper airway culture should be carefully interpreted with cytology to avoid
inappropriate antimicrobial use.
THERAPEUTICS
■ The objectives of therapy include resolving respiratory distress, resolution of severe
cough, and return to adequate function.
Drug(s) of choice
■ Supplemental oxygen should be provided to patients in distress.
■ Antitussives help break the cycle of cough-induced airway irritation that leads to
more cough.
■ Butorphanol tartrate: 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg SQ, IM, or IV every 4 to 6 hours
■ Hydrocodone: 0.22 mg/kg PO every 6 to 12 hours
■Butorphanol has sedative properties.
■Acepromazine: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg IM or IV every 8 to 12 hours
■Diazepam: 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg IV
■ Bronchodilators may be helpful in cases where concurrent small airway disease is
present.
Terbutaline: 0.01 mg/kg IM, or 1.25 to 2.5 mg/dog PO every 12 hours
■ Theophylline: 10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours
■ Glucocorticoid treatment is controversial and may be advantageous in patients with
concurrent small airway disease.
■Anti-inflammatory prednisone: 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours
■Antibiotic use should be restricted to cases with documented concurrent infection.
Diet
■ Obese animals should be placed on strict diet and a strict follow up plan to assess
weight loss.
TRACHEAL COLLAPSE
817
Activity
  Excessive activity and excitement can precipitate a paroxysmal coughing bout and
routine tranquilization may be needed especially during times of anticipated increased
pet activity.
Surgical Considerations
 Surgical options that are commonly utilized include extraluminal ring prostheses
and intraluminal stent placement.
 Procedures are intricate and should be performed by experienced specialists.
■ Because the procedures carry significant morbidity and mortality, many authors
reserve such invasive procedures for only those patients who have failed medical
management.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■  The majority of patients are managed medically.
Patient Monitoring
■Cough frequency will be mainstay of patient monitoring.
■Patient return to activity
Prevention/Avoidance
■Avoid neck leashes and other cervical irritants.
■ Strive for ideal body condition score.
Possible Complications
 Complications of medical management are minimal. Prolonged prednisone usage
may contribute to weight gain due to polyphagia.
 Complications of extraluminal tracheal prostheses include laryngeal paralysis, nec-
rotizing tracheitis from blood flow disruption.
Complications from intraluminal tracheal stent placement include stent migration
stent fracture, pneumonia, and tracheal granulation tissue.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ For severe cases the prognosis fair to guarded.

Traumatic Myocarditis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Traumatic myocarditis is a term used by veterinarians to describe a presumed myo-
cardial injury secondary to blunt nonpenetrating thoracic trauma that most com-
 monly results in ventricular dysrhythmias in the dog.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 The most common mechanism of myocardial contusion in the dog is secondary to
lateral chest compression that subjects the myocardium to compressive and concus-
sive forces. Additionally, it has been proposed that distortion of the thoracic cage
results in a rise in intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures, causing shearing stresses
within the myocardium powerful enough to result in myocardial injury. Conditions
other than direct injury to the heart such as metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, electrolyte
imbalance, intracranial injuries, and catecholamine release may also cause dysrhyth-
mias in traumatized dogs.
Systems Affected
■
 Cardiovascular-dysrhythmias, hypotension, weak pulses, or tachycardia
■ Musculoskeletalweakness, rib fractures, or trauma severe enough to result in limb
and pelvic fractures frequently causes myocardial contusion
Nervous—decreased responsiveness, disorientation, or weakness
■]
Renal/Urologic—decreased urine output
■]
 Respiratory—hypoxia or pulmonary contusion
 Skin—bruising over thoracic cage could be seen
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Risk Factors/Causes
These are no known medical conditions, medications, or environmental factors that
predispose the dog or cat to developing this condition.
819
820
Historical Findings
■ Trauma is the only presenting complaint that is associated with traumatic myocar-
ditis. Most commonly automobile induced injury is associated with this condition
but other injuries such as animal attacks (i.e., bite, kicks) and falls from height can
also cause myocardial injuries.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Dogs
■ The diagnostic gold standard in the identification of cardiac injury remains the gross
or histologic examination of the heart. Because visualization or myocardial biopsy is
uncommon, a high index of suspicion for and understanding of myocardial injury
are essential in making a diagnosis. Traumatic myocarditis should be suspected in
traumatized dogs with the following injuries: (l) fractures of extremities, the spine
 or pelvis, (2) external evidence of thoracic trauma, (3) radiographic evidence of chest
trauma such as pulmonary contusions, pneumothorax, hemothorax, diaphragmatic
hernia, and rib/scapular fractures, and (4) neurologic injury. Cardiac dysrhythmias
are frequently delayed in onset up to 48 hours after the inciting event.
Cats
■ This condition has not traditionally been reported in cats but remains possible, and
the same features reported in dogs could easily be applied to cats once underlying
cardiac disease was ruled out.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Dogs
Dysrhythmias associated with trauma may also be caused by:
■ Underlying heart disease
■ Metabolic acidosis
■Hypoxia
■
Electrolyte imbalance
■
 Intracranial injuries
Pain (catecholamine release).
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Blood work
■ CBC, biochemistry panel, urinalysis, and arterial or venous blood gas
■Radiographs
TRAUMATIC MYOCARDITIS 821
1 Thoracic—pulmonary contusions, pneumothorax, hemothorax, or rib fracture
Abdominal—evidence of effusion (i.e., blood, urine), free abdominal gas
■Appendicular—fractures
■Echocardiogram
■ Abnormal findings may include:
■ Increased end-diastolic wall thickness
■
 Impaired contractility, indicated by wall motion abnormalities and decreased
fractional shortening
■ Increased echogenicity
■ Localized areas of echolucency consistent with intramural hematomas.
■ ECG—ventricular dysrhythmias most common, often delayed in onset up to 48
hours
■Intermittent
■Continuous
■Holter monitoring
■ Serum myocardial isoenzyme/proteins
■ CPK-MB
■ Cardiac troponins (I and 1)
Pathological Findings
■Pathologic findings in the traumatized heart have been characterized by localized
edema, ecchymosis, and intramyocardial hematoma formation. These injuries are
often transmural with the epicardial surface being more severely affected.
■ Dysrhythmias and conduction defects are the most common physiologic conse-
quences to myocardial injuries.
The most common dysrhythmias encountered secondary to canine myocardial inju-
ries include premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and non-
specific S-T segment elevation or depression.
 Although less frequent than ventricular dysrhythmias, other dysrhythmias reported
in dogs with chest trauma include atrial fibrillation, sinus arrest with ventricular, or
junctional escape complexes and second- and third-degree AV block.
THERAPEUTICS
 Treatment is typically aimed at suppressing potentially life-threatening dysrhythmias
such as multiform premature ventricular complexes, ventricular tachycardia, and the
R-on-T phenomenon. Dysrhythmias that result in hypotension, weakness, pale
mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill time, collapse, or syncope in patients
that have received adequate fluids, electrolytes, oxygen, and pain control should also
be addressed. The therapeutic goal of these recommendations is not necessarily total
alleviation of the dysrhythmia; adequate therapy may be reduction of the heart rate
(<l40 beats per minute) or the return of hemodynamic stability
Drug(s) of Choice
Lidocaine: 2 mg/kg intravenous bolus. Lidocaine boluses may be repeated as needed
every 10 to 20 minutes until a cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg is given. If the therapeutic
response is favorable to intravenous bolus therapy an intravenous CRl of 40 to
80 μg/kg per minute should be initiated to maintain a normal rhythm. In many cases.
additional boluses may be required to suppress the arrhythmia while steady state
blood levels of lidocaine are achieved by the CRl.
■ When lidocaine fails to resolve ventricular ectopy procainamide may be adminis-
tered IV or IM (6-15 mg/kg every 46 hours). Procainamide may also be adminis-
tered as a CRl (l0-40μg/kg per minute) or given orally (sustained release formulation
20 mg/kg three times daily). Good success is noted in transitioning to mexiletine
(4-8mg/kg PO three times daily) as an oral anti-arrhythmic for animals being dis-
charged that require continued suppression of arrhythmias.
 The addition of a β-blocker should be considered for the treatment of ventricular
ectopy that remains unresponsive to class I anti-arrhythmics in traumatized dogs.
Use of β-blockers should be reserved for patients that have been appropriately treated
for shock and are not receiving positive inotropic medications.
■ In some instances, ventricular ectopy will not be suppressed with antiarrhythmic
drugs alone. Careful monitoring of the patient's electrolyte and acid-base status is
necessary because acidosis, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia can be present and
promote continued ventricular tachycardia. Judicious use of potassium supplementa.
tion (dose according to degree of hypokalemia) and magnesium chloride (0.75 mEq/
kg/day IV CRl) should be considered when acid-base and electrolyte derangements
are also present.
Precautions/Interactions
■ High doses of lidocaine can result in seizures; cats are very sensitive to the adverse
side effects of lidocaine.
■ Hypotension and AV conduction block are serious potential side effects of procain-
amide administration.
■β-blockers can result in serious potential side effects such as AV block, hypotension,
brochoconstriction, and decreased cardiac contractility.
■ Oral anti-arrhythmics can cause gastrointestinal upset such as anorexia and
vomiting.
■ Use care to avoid administration of more than 0.5mEq/kg per hour potassium
supplementation.
■ Oversupplementation with magnesium chloride can cause muscle fasciculation,
tremors, and AV block.
Activity
■ Activity restriction will depend on primary injuries, but the author recommends a
minimum of 2 weeks of exercise restriction to allow cardiopulmonary injuries to
resolve.
TRAUMATIC MYOCARDITIS823
Surgical Considerations
■ If a patient with a myocardial injury must undergo anesthesia, drugs should be
selected that are least likely to induce arrhythmias, such as acepromazine, butorpha-
nol, isoflurane, and glycopyrrolate. Halothane, atropine sulfate, and the thiobarbitu-
ates would be poor choices as they tend to exacerbate dysrhythmias and sensitize
the heart to catecholamine induced dysrhythmias.
COMMENTS
 Onset of dysrhythmias can be delayed for up to 24 hours. Treatment is only required
in cases with potentially fatal arrhythmias (V-tach, Ron T) and animals with clinical
evidence or hypotension, weak, poor pulses or pulse deficits, or decreased cardiac
output associated with a dysrhythmia. Dysrhythmias associated with trauma should
only be addressed after the other physiologic consequences associated with sustained
injuries are appropriately treated (i.e., fluids, oxygen, pain). Most dysrhythmias
associated with myocardial trauma do not require treatment and resolve in 3 to 10
days.
Client Education
■ Monitor for weakness, respiratory distress, pale mucous membranes, and irregular
pulses.
Patient Monitoring
■  It is recommended that intermittent ECG monitoring continue up to 1 week after
discharge. Prior to re-examination, antiarrhythmic medications should be discontin-
ued for a minimum of 24 hours. Holter monitoring. if available, would be the most
sensitive way to detect complete resolution of arrhythmias after discontinuing antiar
rhythmic medications.
Possible Complications
ary to trauma could result in congestive failure. Persistent dysrhythmias and myo-
cardial dysfunction could occur and require lifelong therapy.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Prognosis is very good; most dysrhythmias resolve within 1 to 2 weeks, complica-
tions are rare.
Synonyms
■ Blunt myocardial injury, myocardial cell injury, myocardial contusion, and cardiac
contusion

Vaginal Hyperplasia/
Prolapse
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Protrusion of spherical or donut-shaped mass from vulva during proestrus or
estrus
 Type I: slight eversion of the vaginal floor but no protrusion through the vulva
 Type Il: vaginal tissue prolapses through the vulvar opening (tongue-shaped mass)
Type Ill: donut-shaped eversion of the entire vaginal wall, including the urethral
orifice, which can be seen ventrally on the prolapsed tissue (Figure ll0.1)
Exaggerated response of vaginal mucosa to estrogen, some affected animals have
follicular cysts
 Despite the name, the change seen histopathologically is consistent with edema
rather than hyperplasia or hypertrophy.
 Severe prolapse: may occlude the urethra and prevent normal urination

 BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
■I
 Exaggerated response of vaginal lining to presence of estrogen level normally present
during proestrus/estrus
■ Some bitches may have follicular cysts, but this is not common or necessary to
produce vaginal hyperplasia
■ Exogenous exposure to estrogens, such as human skin to which hormone replace
ment therapy cram has been applied, may also result in vaginal hyperplasia
■ A few bitches have recurrence near the end of diestrus, in association with a rise in
estrogen at that time
Systerms Affected
■  Reproductive: protrusion of edematous vaginal tissue through vulva
■  Urologic: Stage Ill can cause urethral occlusion and obstructive renal failure.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
        n   s
■ A number of breeds have been reported affected; due to the increased incidence in
some breeds, a genetic cause is postulated.
■ Increased incidence has been reported in boxer, mastiff, bull mastiff, bulldog.
American pit bull terrier and related breeds, and Labrador retriever.
■Also reported in Saint Bernards, German shepherd dogs, walker hounds, Chesapeake
Bay retrievers, springer spaniels, Weimeraners, Airedale terriers, and mixed breeds
Historical Findings
 Currently in proestrus or estrus
 Occasionally in late gestation or diestrus
■
 Protrusion of tissue through the vulva
■Failure to allow mating
■Difficulty urinating
■Excessive licking of vulva
■Prior occurrence
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Protrusion of round, tongue-shaped, or donut-shaped tissue mass from the vulva
■Vaginal examination: locate lumen and urethral orifice; types I and I1: lumen is dorsal
to the prolapse; type Ill: lumen is central to the prolapse; urethral orifice is ventral
to the prolapse.
■Prolapse with all three types
■Tissue may be dry or necrotic.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
2
Vaginal neoplasia—transmissible venereal tumor and leiomyoma; differentiated by
signalment, stage of cycle, and vaginal examination
 Clitoral hypertrophy; differentiated by careful physical examination
DIAGNOSTICS
Vaginal cytology to determine stage of cycle and presence of estrogen stimulation
 Biopsy in older bitch if needed to differentiate from neoplasia
■ Sedation and vaginoscopy if necessary to differentiate from other masses
Pathological Findings
 Careful vaginal examination differentiates from other causes of vaginal masses.
Histopathology shows dramatic edema of vaginal lining.
THERAPEUTICS
Outpatient; unless urethral obstruction
 Breeding—possible by artificial insemination (discuss heritability)
■  Prolapsed tissue—-keep clean and lubricated with sterile water-soluble lubricant
■Minimize tissue trauma
■]
Instruct client to monitor patient's ability to urinate
 If urethral obstruction present, place indwelling urinary catheter (Figure ll0.2)
Regression—usually begins in late estrus; should be resolved during early
diestrus
Recurrence rate66 to 100 percent at next estrous cycle
 Ovariohysterectomy—prevents recurrence; may hasten resolution if performed early
in proestrus
 Severe condition—requires surgical reduction or resection; if possible, perform when
the mass is beginning to regress; identify and catheterize urethra, 25 percent recur-
rence at next cycle after surgery
Drug(s) of Choice
■ GnRH (2.2 μg/kg IM) or hCG (1,000 IU IM), if breeding not planned that cycle; may
hasten ovulation and resolution but it is not effective if given after ovulation
Precautions/Interactions
 Avoid progestational drugs due to risk of inducing pyometra.

 Figure 110.2 Severe vaginal hyperplasia with urinary catheter in place.
Activity
 Keep confined in clean area to prevent tissue damage
 Apply Elizabethan collar to prevent self-trauma
 Separate from other dogs to prevent trauma
Surgical Considerations
■ If ability to urinate is compromised or tissue is necrotic, surgical resection is
necessary.
■ If recurs near end of gestation, delivery of fetuses by Caesarian section may be
necessary.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■  Keep prolapsed tissue clean and moist
Monitor ability to urinate
■
 Consider removing from breeding program due to genetic basis
■ Breed via artificial insemination if breeding still desired
■  Monitor again near end of diestrus/gestation for recurrence
■ If recurs near end of gestation, Caesarian section may be needed
VAGINAL HYPERPLASIA/PROLAPSE833
Patient Monitoring
■  Recheck if any concern about viability of tissue
■]
 Recheck if owner notes inability to urinate
Prevention/Avoidance
■Ovariohysterectomy is recommended.
Possible Complications
 Urethral compromise and inability to urinate
■ Necrosis of prolapsed tissue
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Tissue regresses with time and decrease in estrogen.
■]
 If not spayed, may recur at end of gestation/diestrus
 If not spayed, typically will recur at next proestrus
 Ovariohysterectomy prevents recurrence later in cycle or in future.
■]
 Prognosis for recovery good, except with urethral involvement
■ Surgical intervention for type ll: prognosis good

Ventricular
Dysrhythmias
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
1 If conduction of sinus node pacemaker impulses to the ventricles is blocked or the
impulses decrease in frequency, the lower regions of the heart automatically take
over the role of pacemaker for the ventricles, which results in ventricular escape
complexes (Figure lll.l) or an idioventricular rhythm (Figure lll.2).
Features
1A series of ventricular escape beats with a heart rate < 65 beats per minute in dogs
and <100 beats per minute in cats; heart rates of 65 to 100 beats per minute in dogs
and l00 to l60 beats per minute in cats are often termed accelerated itioventricular
rhythms.
1 P waves may be absent or may precede, be hidden within, or follow the ectopic QRS
complex.
■ P waves are unrelated to the QRS complexes
QRS configuration is wide and bizarre; similar to that of a ventricular premature
complex
during anesthesia. The sinus rate increased (not shown) after anesthesia was stopped; 1/2 cm1 mv.

 Figure 111.2 Complete heart block. The P waves occur at a rate of 120, independent of the ventricular rate
of 50. The QRS configuration is a right bundle branch block pattern. The regular rate and stable QRS indicate
 that the rescuing focus is probably near the AV junction.

ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 May be hemodynamically important with slow ventricular rates
■
 Does not occur in healthy animals
 Subsidiary pacemakers seem to discharge more rapidly in cats than in dogs.
Risk Factors/Causes
 Not a primary disease; a secondary result of a primary disease
The escape rhythm is a safety mechanism to maintain cardiac output.
Causes of sinus bradycardia and sinus arrest
Increased vagal tone (i.e., high intracranial pressure, high ocular pressure)
Drugs: digoxin, tranquilizers, propranolol, quinidine, and anesthetics
■Addison's disease
■Hypoglycemia
■Renal failure

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Species
■ Dogs and cats
Breed Predilections
■ Atrial standstill in English springer spaniels and Siamese cats
■Pugs, miniature schnauzers, and Dalmatians prone to conduction abnormalities
Historical Findings

CLINICAL FEATURES
 Physical Examination Findings
■ Irregular rhythm associated with pulse deficits
■
Variation in heart sounds
■Possible intermittent “cannon” waves in the jugular venous pulses (with AV block)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■ Ventricular tachycardia—dogs have a cardiac rate > lo0 beats per minute;
cats > 150 bpm
Slow heart rate in animals with right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block.
or left anterior fascicular block; animals with these disturbances have the P waves
associated with the QRS complexes.
DIAGNOSTICS
Complete Blood Count/Biochemistry/Urinalysis
■ No specific findings
  Complete blood testing may suggest a metabolic abnormality.
838
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Other Laboratory Tests
■Drug toxicity
■ Lyme's titer in animals with complete AV block
Imaging
■Echocardiogram may show structural heart disease.
Diagnostic Procedures
■Electrocardiography
Pathological Findings
■ Depend on underlying cause
THERAPEUTICS
Drug(s) of Choice
■Atropine or glycopyrrolate usually indicated to block vagal tone or increase the heart
rate
■ If those drugs are ineffective, isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine, or artificial
 pacing may be needed.
Contraindications
■ Lidocaine, procainamide, quinidine, propranolol, diltiazem, or any other drug that
slows the cardiac rate or reduces contractility
Precautions/Interactions
■  Atropine is briefly vagotonic immediately postinjection and can temporarily exacer
bate the condition.
Diet
 No modifications or restrictions unless required for management of the underlying
condition.
Activity
■Symptomatic animals may require cage rest.
Surgical Considerations
■Pacemaker implantation may be necessary.
VENTRICULAR DYSRHYTHMIAS
688
Appropriate Health Care
 Rhythm is an escape or safety mechanism for maintaining cardiac output; do not
 direct treatment toward suppressing this escape rhythm, but toward the primary
disease process that allows the escape rhythm to assume pacemaker control of the
heart.
Symptomatic treatment is directed toward increasing the heart rate.
Nursing Care
■May be required for underlying disease
COMMENTS
Client Education
■  Inform of the need to seek and specifically treat an underlying cause
Patient Monitoring
■ Serial ECG may show clearing of the lesion or progression to complete heart
block.
■ Serial blood profiles may be needed to monitor progress of the primary disease
process.
■ Serial echocardiograms may show improvement or progressive changes in cardiac
structure.
Possible Complications
■  Prolonged bradycardia may cause secondary congestive heart failure or inadequate
renal perfusion.
Expected Course and Prognosis
 Arrhythmia may abate when the primary disorder is corrected.
■ Guarded if condition is associated with cardiac or metabolic disorder; poor if the
rate is not increased pharmacologically or if underlying cause cannot be identified
and treated

Vomiting and
Hematemesis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Vomiting blood
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/ETIOLOGY
1Blood may be vomited because of (a) mucosal disruption (ulcer/erosion) in esopha-
geal, gastric, intestinal, or gall bladder mucosa, (b) coagulopathy, or (c) patient
swallowing blood originating from either inside (e.g., mouth, nose, or lungs) or
outside the body.
Causes of Gastric Ulceration/Erosion
Drugs
■ Newer COX-2 selective NSAIDs are safer than older, nonselective NSAIDs but can
still cause GUE.
  Dexamethasone is probably the most ulcerogenic of commonly used steroids.
■Prednisolone is much less ulcerogenic unless there are other, additional factors favor-
ing GUE.
Gastritis
■Often idiopathic
■ May be caused by ingestion of toxic/irritative substances (e.g., heavy metals, fertil-
izer, etc).
■Helicobacter spp. are not considered a cause of canine or feline GUE.
■]
Pythiosis causes mucosal disruption and GUE.
 Gastric foreign bodies occasionally cause GUE and bleeding, but they inhibit healing
of GUE from any other cause.
■ Inflammatory bowel disease has been associated with GUE, but cause and effect are
uncertain.
1"Stress"/poor perfusion/shock—-probably due to poor visceral perfusion coupled with
increased endogenous steroids.
841
■ Gastric and duodenal neoplasia—mechanically disrupt gastric mucosa. Leiomyomas
are most important cause, but other tumors occasionally responsible.
Other Diseases Causing Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage
■ Hookworms—Severe infestations cause upper duodenal bleeding with duodenal-
gastric reflux.
         
bacterial-induced.
■ Hepatic disease—Severe hepatic failure often associated with GUE by uncertain
mechanisms.
■  Pancreatitis—Duodenal hemorrhage in severe cases when there is severe inflamma-
tion by direct extension.
■  Renal failure—Not as important as previously thought.
■ Hypoadrenocorticism—Rare but important; mimics primary Gl disease; assume
mucosal disruption due to lack of steroids.
■Esophagitis—-Ulcers/erosions due to foreign bodies, caustic substances (e.g., tetracy-
cline) or gastroesophageal reflux of acid.
Causes of Coagulopathies
 Thrombocytopenia (numerous causes)
■ von Willebrand's disease
■Vitamin K antagonism
■ DIC
■Congenital defects
Causes of Ingestion of Blood
■Endogenous blood: coughing blood up from airway swallowing and then vomiting
it (all without hemoptysis) can be due to airway disease, nasal or bronchopulmonary
tumor, pneumonia, heartworms, fungal infections.
■ Exogenous blood: blood from any outside source (e.g., food, lacerations, anal sacs)
may be ingested and later vomited.
Systems Affected
■Gastrointestinal-Inflammation, trauma, ulceration, neoplasia or foreign body in the
oral cavity esophagus, stomach or duodenum causes anorexia, vomiting. or
regurgitation.
■ Cardiovascular—Acute, severe hemorrhage causes tachycardia, systolic heart
murmur, or hypotension.
■ Respiratory—-Respiratory hemorrhage with ingestion causes hematemesis, tachypnea
due to severe hemorrhage (shock), aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary infiltrative
disease.
VOMITING AND HEMATEMESIS
■Hemic/Lymphatic/Immune—Coagulopathy causing G1 hemorrhage
cancause
hematemesis.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Risk Factors/Causes
Dogs more commonly affected than cats.
 No recognized genetic, breed, age, or sex predilections. -
■ Animals more likely to receive NSAIDs are probably at increased risk for GUE.
Historic Findings
 Vomiting blood—may appear as fresh (red; Figure 1l12.1) or digested (coffee grounds;
Figure 1l2.2) blood. Minimal bleeding due to mucosal trauma from vigorous vomit-
ing may cause small "flecks" of blood. Not all dogs with upper Gl bleeding vomit
blood or even vomit.
■ Melena—Black, tarry stools; only seen when large amount of blood enters Gl tract
in relatively short time. Much less common than hematemesis
■ Anorexia— Very common sign of gastric disease, even in absence of vomiting
■
Abdominal pain—May assume “"praying position" (infrequent)
Weakness/respiratory distress—-Either/both can be seen with severe anemia
 Coagulopathy—May see petechiation, ecchymosis, hyphema or epistaxis

CLINICAL FEATURES

weakness (especially in rear legs in dogs), sometimes collapse.
■ Abdominal pain—inconsistent finding: can be subtle.
Melena—very infrequent.
■
Coagulopathy—petechiations, ecchymoses, hematochezia, epistaxis, retinal hemor-
rhage, hyphema, or hematuria.
■Edema—-infrequent; only when serum albumin < 1.6 g/dl.
Cats
■Similar to dogs, but less frequent.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Dogs
■Hemoptysis—history may allow differentiation. Thoracic radiographs usually reveal
thoracic/airway lesions.
VOMITING AND HEMATEMESIS 845
 Regurgitation of blood—primarily from ingestion of blood or severe esophagitis or
trauma from foreign objects. Plain/contrast radiographs of esophagus often diagnose
foreign objects. Esophagoscopy is most sensitive test for esophagitis.
 Ingestion and vomiting of foreign material or food that looks like blood (e.g., iron
products).
■ Melena can be mimicked by oral administration of bismuth subsalicylate
Cats
■ Same as but less frequent than for dogs.

in patients not iron deficient, plus hypoalbuminemia.
 Chronic iron deficiency anemia causes poorly regenerative, microcytic anemia with
hypoalbuminemia (i.e., low total serum iron concentration).
 Panhypoproteinemia may or may not be found, depending on serum globulin con-
centration before blood loss
 Thrombocytosis may occur with chronic iron deficiency; thrombocytopenia may
cause bleeding diathesis
 Nonspecific findings include neutrophilic leukocytosis.

Hepatic failure caused by cirrhosis may/may not have increased ALT or bilirubin,
usually causes hypoalbuminemia.
 Hypoadrenocorticism may or may not cause electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatre-
 mia/hyperkalemia), hypercalcemia, hypoglycemia, or inappropriate lymphocytosis or
eosinophilia in stressed dogs.
Special Blood Tests
  Pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity appears to be most sensitive test for pancreatitis.
but specificity is uncertain.
 Resting serum cortisol concentration is acceptable screen for patients most likely to
benefit from ACTH-stimulation testing.
 Serum gastrin needed to diagnose gastrinomas.
 Pre- and postprandial serum bile acids or blood ammonia for hepatic insuffciency.
Coagulation profiles for coagulopathies.
 Serology/PCR for pythiosis.
■Fecal flotation for Ancylostoma ova.
■ Buccal mucosal bleeding time is a reasonable screening test for coagulopathies severe
enough to cause GI bleeding.
Imaging
 Abdominal radiographs may reveal foreign objects or spontaneous pneumoperito-
neum (i.e., gastrointestinal perforation or septic peritonitis).
■ Abdominal ultrasound more revealing and can demonstrate thickened infiltrated
areas, ulcers, scant amounts of free fluid, foreign objects, hepatic disease, or pancre-
atitis. Ultrasound can guide fine needle aspiration of apparently infiltrated areas or
small pockets of fluid for fluid analysis and cytology.
■ Upper GI contrast radiographs not recommended in Gl patients with upper GI
hemorrhage except possibly  when looking for esophageal foreign bodies or
inflammation.
■  Thoracic radiographs may reveal foreign bodies or pulmonary lesions.
Pathologic Findings
■ Gastroduodenoscopy is most sensitive for finding lesions between mouth and distal
duodenal flexure. Once coagulopathy is eliminated, biopsies should routinely be
obtained of any lesion; gross appearances may be deceiving.
■  Infiltrated lesions may be inflammatory or neoplastic.
■  Lesions may be very sporadic necessitating endoscopic guidance of the biopsies to
maximize chance of diagnosis.
THERAPEUTICS
■ The first goal is to stop G1 bleeding: next is to stop clinical signs (e.g., anorexia,
vomiting) and resolve lesion to minimize chance of perforation.
Drug(s) of choice
■ Drugs are often ineffective if cause (e.g., NSAID drugs. poor perfusion) is not
removed; important to remove cause while treating medically.
■ H, receptor antagonists are most commonly used drugs.
■ Cimetidine is least potent and has most side effects.
■ Famotidine is most potent H receptor antagonist (0.5mg/kg PO or IV, every
12-24 hours)
■ Ranitidine (1-4 mg/kg PO or IV every 8-12 hours) and nizatidine (2.5-5mg/kg
 PO every 24 hours) are supposed to have gastric prokinetic activity. Ranitidine is
of uncertain value in raising gastric pH. Length of treatment depends upon cause.
 If no clinical response seen within 7 days, reevaulate patient and therapy.
■ Proton pump inhibitors are noncompetitive inhibitors of gastric acid secretion and
more effective than H, receptor antagonist; principal use is for gastrinomas and
VOMITING AND HEMATEMESIS847
esophagitis. Requires 2 to 5 days to achieve maximal efficacy when administered
orally.
■ Omeprazole (0.7-1.5mg/kg PO every 12-24 hours) is most commonly
 prescribed.
           
daily.
 Orally administered antacids (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) may require six or more
 daily administrations to achieve same degree of acid control as H receptor antago-
nists or proton pump inhibitors.
 Sucralfate (0.5-lg PO every 12-24 hours) binds to ulcer sites, stimulates healing
and protects them.
■ Misoprostol—Prostaglandin analog developed as a prophylaxis against NSAID-
induced GUE. Can be used to treat GUE (2-5 μg/kg PO every 8 to 12 hours) as well
 as prevent it. It may initially cause diarrhea or abdominal cramping.
■Antiemetics may be used symptomatically, as necessary:
 Ondansetron (0.5-1 mg/kg PO or 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV every 12-24 hours)
Dolasetron (0.6-1 mg/kg IV or SQ every 24 hours)
■ Maropitant (1 mg/kg SQ every 24 hours or 2 mg/kg PO every 24 hours).
■ Amoxicillin (22 mg/kg PO every 12 hours) plus metronidazole (15 mg/kg PO every
24 hours) plus famotidine (0.5 mg/kg PO every 24 hours) generally effective against
Helicobacter spp. found in dogs and cats; but, Helicobacter is doubtful cause of canine
or feline GUE.
Precautions/Interactions
■Cimetidine inhibits hepatic P450 enzymes.
 Sucralfate may inhibit absorption of some other orally administered drugs.
■ NSAIDs are potentially catastrophic in GUE patients.
Surgical Considerations
■ If GI bleeding due to suspected GUE does not show evidence of improvement within
5 to 7 days of starting medical therapy or if G1 blood loss is so severe that waiting
for medical therapy puts patient at inappropriate risk, one should perform endoscopy
to see if responsible lesion(s) appear(s) resectable. Leiomyomas are potentially
resectable and should be removed as soon as possible. Patients apparently in danger
of perforating should have lesions resected, if possible.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■ All NSAIDs increase GUE risk; if NSAIDs have caused GI bleeding once before, they
must be used cautiously under supervision of veterinarian.
848
BLACKWELL'S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
Patient Monitoring
■ Clinically monitoring patient (i.e., attitude, mucous membrane color, abdominal
pain, vomiting, appetite) is usually sufficient to determine efficacy of medical therapy.
■ Animals with especially low hematocrits (i.e.,<20 percent in dog: <l8 percent in
cat) must be monitored closely; serial hematocrits may be appropriate. Repeat endos-
Prevention/Avoidance
 Avoid (a) concurrent administration of NSAIDs and steroids; (b) concurrent use of
two NSAIDs; (c) large doses of dexamethasone; (d) large doses of any steroid or
NSAID in poorly perfused or hypoxic patients.
Possible Complications
■ GUE perforation causes septic peritonitis. Vomiting sometimes associated with aspi-
ration pneumonia. Severe blood loss necessitates administration of red blood cells
or purified bovine hemoglobin.
  Misoprostol (a synthetic prostaglandin) causes abortion in pregnant animals.
Expected Course and Prognosis
■ Prognosis depends on cause.
■ GUE due to NSAIDs and dexamethasone can usually be resolved.
■  Gastric malignancies have extremely poor prognosis; but leiomyomas are often cured
with surgical resection.
■ Paraneoplastic hyperacidity (gastrinomas and mast cell tumors) often palliated for
months to a year.
■ Severe hepatic failure and gastric pythiosis have guarded to very poor prognosis,
respectively.
■ Hypoadrenocorticism has excellent prognosis if diagnosed and treated in a timely
fashion.

Von Willebrand
Disease (vWD)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
■ vWD is a qualitative or quantitative deficiency in vWF, causing a dysfunctional
interaction between platelets and vascular collagen (primary hemostasis), thereby
reducing the adherence of platelets to sites of vascular injury.
 The most common inherited bleeding disorder in dogs, with inheritance being influ-
enced by vWD type.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Clinical manifestations are brought about by a reduction in two of the established
functions of vWF; first,its role in supporting adhesion of platelets to damaged blood
vessels (specifically subendothelial collagen), and second, postsynthetic association
of vWF with factor VIl1 that protects factor V1l1 from proteolysis.
■The disease has been divided into three different major types.
 Type l vWD is characterized by a partial quantitative deficiency of all vWF sizes that
have a normal multimeric structure; most frequently documented type with clinical
signs indirectly correlated with reduction in plasma vWF
■ Iype 2 vWD is characterized by both a quantitative and qualitative deficiency of
vWF with the quantitative deficiency primarily affecting the larger (more hemostati-
cally active) multimers; least commonly diagnosed variant in animals.
 Type 3 vWD is the most fatal type, due to a severe quantitative deficiency (vWF :Ag
<l percent) of vWF
 Type 3 vWD is associated with the most severe hemorrhage, whereas type 1 vWD
generally manifests with the least severe hemorrhage.
Systems Affected
1 Gastrointestinal—Bleeding during teething or mucosal hemorrhage
■F
Hemic/lymphatic/Immune—Anemia if hemorrhage is severe
 Renal/Urologic—Hematuria
Reproductive—-Prolonged estral hemorrhage
 Respiratory—Epistaxis
 Skin/ExocrineHemorrhage from wounds or surgical sites, cutaneous bruising. or
rarely petechia
851
852
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
■  No sex predilection
■ Most patients affected from birth
■
 Type l: many canine breeds (Doberman pinschers, Airedales, shelties); Himalayans
■
 Type 2: German wirehaired pointer, German shorthaired pointer
Type 3: Scottish terrier, Shetland sheepdog: domestic longhair and domestic short-
hair felines
Risk Factors/Causes
■Hypothyroidism has been found to be associated with vWD in dogs.
■ Known familial inheritance.
Historical Findings
■Bleeding may or may not be a historical feature.
■ Excessive hemorrhage noted at the time of teething, during estrus or secondary to
minor injury.
■ Sometimes familial inheritance is known.
CLINICAL FEATURES
■ Symptoms related to deficiency in primary hemostasis, such as spontaneous mucosal
hemorrhage (i.e., epistaxis, hematuria, GI hemorrhage), more commonly overt hem-
orrhage after trauma or during teething or surgery; mild to moderate bleeding is
typical.
■ Petechiation is uncommon in dogs and cats.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
■Thrombocytopenia
 Inherited (Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, etc.) or acquired (aspirin therapy, etc.)
thrombocytopathies
DIAGNOSTICS
■ Different subtypes of vWD require slightly different diagnostic strategies.
■ Prolonged BMBT with normal platelet count is typical, however BMBT is not sensi-
 tive enough to consistently detect mild vWD and a normal result does not rule out
the disease; in addition, clinical utility is limited by problems with standardization
of the procedure.

WWD, von Willebrand disease; vwwF, von Willbrand factor.
Definitive diagnosis requires confirmation of low vWF :Ag with types l and 3, but
may be normal in type 2 (see Table 1l2.1).
The PT is usually normal, whereas aPTT may be prolonged due to reduced levels of
plasma factor Vlll because the plasma level factor Vlll depends on vWF level,
patients with milder forms of vWD usually have normal levels of factor VII1.
■ Being an acute phase reactant, transiently increased levels during hemorrhage may
obscure the diagnosis, therefore, if possible, tests should not be performed in prox-
imity to hemorrhagic events, acute infection, pregnancy, or strenuous exercise.
 If a laboratory diagnosis of vWD is made in an older canine patient with only a recent
history of clinical signs, consider evaluating for hypothyroidism.
Pathological Findings
■ Hemorrhage possible at any site, but most commonly associated with areas of trauma
or surgery.
THERAPEUTICS
  Different types of vWD require slightly different therapeutic strategies.
Drug(s) of Choice
■ DDAVP is the treatment of choice in type 1 vWD, used to transiently increase the
endogenous release of factor vWF from endothelial storage sites, as well as increase
factor VIIl.
 Use of DDAVP may avoid transfusion in patients requiring only temporary normal-
ization of primary hemostasis (i.e., patients undergoing brief invasive procedures).
 Cryoprecipitate (concentrated form of vWF and factor VII1) may be used to replace
vWF in all three types of vWD.
Precautions/Interactions
 Tachyphylaxis rapidly occurs to DDAVP limiting its usefulness to just a few doses.
Free water retention after DDAVP administration rarely leads to volume overload or
hyponatremia.
■ Increasing risk of immunologic transfusion reactions with chronic repeated admin-
istration of allogenic blood products
■Acute administration of FFP may predispose to circulatory overload.
Alternative Drugs
■ FFP may be used to provide vWF if cryoprecipitate is not available.
■ Administration of DDAVP to the blood donor, prior to unit collection, increases the
level of vWF in the donated unit.
■ Thyroid supplementation if concomitant hypothyroidism exists.
Site-specific therapy may be necessary (i.e., direct pressure, use of hemostatically
active agents, or surgical hemostasis).
Activity
■ Limit activity in patients shown to manifest with spontaneous hemorrhage.
Surgical Considerations
  Prophylactic vWF replacement prior to invasive procedures or at least have appropri-
ate blood products readily available.
■ Avoid elective procedures, but if necessary maximize surgical hemostasis
techniques.
COMMENTS
Client Education
■Review mode of inheritance and discuss appropriate breeding practices; animals with
clinical hemorrhage should not be used for breeding. asymptomatic carriers would
preferably not be utilized or at a minimum be bred only with cleared partners.
■Recommend diagnostic testing for related animals.
■ Herbal supplements, notably garlic, gingko, and ginseng, may exacerbate hemor-
rhagic tendencies.
Patient Monitoring
■Screening is important for breeds with a high prevalence.
■Evaluate fluid and electrolyte status if DDAVP was administered.
■ Closely observe for hemorrhagic events, especially following surgical or accidental
trauma.
Prevention/Avoidance
■ Avoid breeding affected animals.
VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE (VWD)855
Conscious measures are taken to limit risk of hemorrhage (i.e., conservative nail
trims, etc.).
Possible Complications
■ Hemorrhage, especially with concurrent medical conditions known to influence
primary hemostasis (i.e., thrombocytopenia, uremia, hepatic disease, etc.) or admin-
istration of medications known to inhibit platelet function (aspirin or other nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatories, phenothiazine tranquilizers, synthetic colloids, etc.).
Expected Course and Prognosis
■Disease is medically managed, but not cured.
■]
 Hemorrhage may be fatal or is controlled with appropriate therapy.
■ Long-term prognosis varies with vWD type that the animal has.

Zinc Toxicity
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
 Toxicity from the ingestion of zinc containing objects, most commonly U.S. pennies
minted after 1982
Causes severe intravascular hemolysis, gastrointestinal irritation, renal injury; may
lead to multiple organ failure, DIC and cardiopulmonary arrest; pancreatitis can
occur as a possible sequela
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
1 The stomach's acidic environment mediates the rapid release of zinc from ingested
foreign materials; rate of zinc release depends on gastric pH, presence or absence of
food/ingesta, and the length of time foreign objects are in stomach.
After absorption, zinc is transported to the liver and excreted through feces and
pancreatic secretions.
■ Exact mechanism of zinc-mediated hemolysis and zinc-mediated renal injury are
unknown.
Systems Affected
Hemic: Zinc toxicity induces severe intravascular hemolysis.
 Renal/Urologic: Zinc mediated renal injury possibly secondary to anemia, hypoxia.
or direct tubular injury
1 Gastrointestinal: Direct irritation and corrosive effects from presence of metallic
 Cardiovascular/Respiratory: Zinc toxicosis sequela includes DIC and cardiopulmo-
nary arrest from severe hypoxia, anemia, and multiple organ failure
 Hepatobiliary: Zinc is transported to the liver and can cause hepatocellular damage.
 Nervous: There is one report of zinc neurotoxicity in a puppy possibly caused by
secondary hypoxia and neuronal ischemia.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Due to the higher incidence of dietary indiscretion in dogs, they are the most com-
d   xs o   r  s

ZINC TOXICITY 
859
Risk Factors/Causes
■ Ingestion of zinc containing objects such as U.s. pennies minted after 1982
(Figures 1l4.1 and 1l4.2). galvanized metal, plumbing parts, and zinc oxide
ointments
Historical Findings
■ Most penny ingestions are not witnessed and the most commonly reported clinical
signs by owners include: depression, vomiting, weakness, abdominal pain, icterus,
and signs of renal failure
CLINICAL FEATURES
Signs of intravascular hemolysis include: icterus, weakness, depression, pale mucous
membranes, and hematuria/hemoglobinuria
Signs of gastrointestinal irritation include: vomiting/hematemesis, diarrhea/hemato-
chezia/melena, anorexia, abdominal pain; or signs of acute pancreatitis
Signs ofacute toxic renal failure include: PU/PD, oliguria or anuria, vomiting, depres.
sion, weakness, or anorexia
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
 Differential diagnosis includes any other causes of hemolytic anemia such as immune-
mediated hemolytic anemia, tick-borne diseases, allium (chive, garlic, leek, onion,
shallot) toxicity, toxicity from other metals (lead, copper); infectious disease (i.e.,
hemobartonellosis, heartworm disease, leptospirosis, and feline leukemia virus infec-
tion), neoplasia, and splenic torsion.
DIAGNOSTICS
■ The diagnosis of zinc toxicity is usually based on clinical signs and radiographic
identification of metallic objects in the gastrointestinal tract (Figure ll4.3).
Biochemical abnormalities:
■ Hemolysis: moderate to severe regenerative anemia, bilirubinemia, bilirubinuria,
hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria
 Renal failure: azotemia, hyposthenuria
■ RBC abnormalities: nucleated RBC, basophilic stippling. target cells,
polychromasia
■ Evidence of multiple organ failure: elevated ALT, ALP, coagulation abnormalities
(prolonged PT, PTT, high FDP, thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimers)
860

small intestine.
 Zinc concentrations of serum or urine: dog normal is 0.7 to 2.0 ppm, a concentration
above 10 ppm is diagnostic for zinc toxicity.
■ Zinc toxicosis may cause a positive outcome for a Coombs' test in the absence of a
primary autoimmune disorder.
Pathological Findings
 Postmortem changes include tubular nephrosis; centrolobar to midzonal hepatic
necrosis, vacuolar degeneration; pancreatic inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis; gas.
with hypoxia.
THERAPEUTICS
■ Goals of therapy include patient stabilization, minimizing zinc absorption via the
removal of the metallic object, supportive care for subsequent hemolysis and renal
failure.
■ Initial patient stabilization includes treatment of shock with intravenous crystalloid
fluids, supplemental oxygen therapy blood or bovine hemoglobin glutamer
(Oxyglobin?) transfusions, antiemetic, and gastroprotectant drugs.
■Removal of the zinc containing object is critical and may be achieved with emesis in
asymptomatic patients. Surgical or endoscopic removal may be required, depending
on location of the foreign body.
IIXOINIZ
861
Drug(s) of Choice
■ H-receptor blockers help reduce zinc absorption by decreasing gastric acidity
(Famotidine 0.5 mg/kg PO, SQ, or IV).
Proton pump inhibitors
■Diuresis with a balanced crystalloid solution is indicated to address dehydration,
prevent hemoglobinuric nephrosis, and promote renal excretion of zinc at twice
maintenance rate.
■Activated charcoal is not recommended because it is ineffective in adsorbing elemen-
tal zinc.
 Sucralfate (0.5-l.0g orally two to three times daily) after removal of zinc containing
object as a gastroprotectant
■Antiemetics for gastrointestinal upset (Dolasetron 0.6-1.0 g/kg IV every 24 hours,
Ondansetron 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV every 6-12 hours; 0.1-1 mg/kg PO every 12 hours,
Metoclopramide hydrochloride 0.2-0.4 mg/kg PO, SQ, or IV constant rate infusion
at 1-2 mg/kg per day)
 Transfusions: Packed RBC transfusions (l0 ml/kg) after blood typing, Oxyglobin@
(Biopure, 15 ml/kg in dogs. 2 to 5ml/kg in cats); fresh frozen plasma (10ml/kg) in
cases in which pancreatitis or coagulopathy are evident
 Chelation therapy is controversial as is may increase gastrointestinal absorption and
potential for nephrotoxicity.
■ Calcium EDTA: 25 mg/kg SQ every 6 hours for 2 to 5 days
■ Oral penicillamine 35 mg/kg four times daily for 7 to 14 days
Surgical Considerations
■ Surgical or endoscopic removal of the zinc containing objects may need to be
attempted; care to stabilize the patient before anesthesia should be taken
COMMENTS
Patient Monitoring
■ Monitor blood urea nitrogen, creatine, phosphorus, packed cell volume, urine output
and urine specific gravity, coagulation profiles throughout the course of treatment.
■ Monitoring clinical signs of anemia such as respiration rate, heart rate, and energy
level may help in deciding if a blood transfusion may be necessary.
Prevention/Avoidance
■  Inform client about the hazards of ingesting zinc-containing objects and to avoid
using zinc oxide ointments.
Possible Complications
 Sequelae include DlC and multiple organ failure with cardiopulmonary arrest.
