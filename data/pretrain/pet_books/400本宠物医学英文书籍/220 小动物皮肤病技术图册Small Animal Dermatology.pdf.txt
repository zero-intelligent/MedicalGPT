To Be Brilliant
To be brilliant is to look past want to what you have.
To be brilliant is to be streaming with the line of the law but always one step ahead.
To be brilliant is to be thinking without stopping, without yielding, without procrastination.
To be brilliant is to be yet graceful when inside stress and frustration.
To be briliant is to always be brilliant.

cases is ketoconazole (dogs) or fluconazole 10 mg/

be continued until lesions resolve and follow-up
skin cytology reveals no organisms (approximately
4 weeks).
4. Alternatively, treatment with terbinafine 5-40 mg/
kg PO every 24 hours or itraconazole (Sporanox)
5-10 mg/kg every 24 hours for 4 weeks may be
effective.
5. Pulse therapy protocols using several drugs and a
variety of schedules have been published; however,
these often take longer to resolve the active
infection.
6. The prognosis is good if the underlying cause can be
identified and corrected. Otherwise, regular once- or
twice-weekly antiyeast shampoo baths may
be
 needed to prevent relapse. This disease is not consid-
ered contagious to other animals or to humans,
except for immunocompromised individuals.

with highest incidences reported in young to middle-
aged dogs that swim frequently in a lake or pond. Skin
lesions are usually progressive and locally invasive, and
are characterized by firm dermal to subcutaneous
nodules, or ulcerated, edematous masses, with areas
of necrosis and numerous fistulous tracts that drain a
hemorrhagic, mucopurulent exudate. Lesions are most
common on the extremities and the trunk. Regional
lymphadenopathy is often present. Dissemination to
distant sites such as great vessels, lungs, and mediasti-

CHAPTER 5 · Parasitic Skin Disorders
Feline Scabies (notoedric mange)
Features
Feline scabies is a disease that is caused by Notoedres cati,
a sarcoptic mite that burrows superficially in the skin.
In multiple-cat households and catteries, more than one
cat is usually affected. The condition is rare in cats.
 Feline scabies is noted as intensely pruritic, dry,
crusted lesions that usually first appear on the medial
edges of ear pinnae, then spread rapidly over the ears,
head, face, and neck. Lesions may subsequently spread
to the feet and perineum. Infested skin becomes
thickened, lichenified, alopecic, crusted, or excoriated.
Peripheral lymphadenomegaly is common. If untreated,
 lesions may spread over large areas of the body, and
anorexia, emaciation, and death may occur.

Differentials include ear mites,

and autoimmune skin disorders.
Diagnosis
1. Microscopy (superficial skin scrapings): detection of
notoedric mites, nymphs, larvae, or ova.
2. Dermatohistopathology: superficial perivascular or
interstitial dermatitis  with  varying numbers  of
eosinophils and pronounced focal parakeratosis.
Mite segments may be found in the superficial
epidermis.
Treatment and Prognosis
FIGURE 5-51 Feline Scabies. Generalized alopecia and

Mosquito Bite Hypersensitivity
205
Mosquito Bite Hypersensitivity
Features
Mosquito bite hypersensitivity is an uncommon sea-
sonal disease in cats sensitized to mosquito bites.
It appears as mildly to severely pruritic papules, pus-
tules, erosions, and crusts on the bridge of the nose and
on the outer ear pinnae. Lesions may be hypopigmented
or hyperpigmented and symmetrical. The bridge of the
nose is often swollen. The footpads, especially on the
outer margins, may be hyperkeratotic, hyperpigmented
or hypopigmented, fissured, painful, swollen, or ulcer-
 ated. Peripheral lymphadenomegaly may be present.

Diagnosis
1. Seasonal history, clinical findings, and response to
confinement  to a mosquito-free
 environment.
Lesions improve within 4 to 7 days.
 2. Dermatohistopathology (nondiagnostic): hyperplas-
tic, superficial perivascular to diffuse eosinophilic
dermatitis.
Treatment and Prognosis
1. The cat should be confined indoors, especially at
dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.
2. To repel mosquitoes, the caregiver should apply a
water-based dilute pyrethrin spray topically  to
affected areas every 24 hours. Caution should be

Feline idiopathic Ufcerative Dermatosis
219
Feline Idiopathic Ulcerative Dermatosis
Features
Feline idiopathic ulcerative dermatosis is an ulcerative
skin disease of unknown origin. It is rare in cats.
The lesion is a heavily crusted, nonhealing ulcer that
is surrounded by a border of thickened skin. It may be
painful and occurs most commonly on the dorsal
midline of the caudal neck or between the shoulder
blades. A peripheral lymphadenomegaly may be present.
No signs of systemic illness are seen.

Diagnosis
1. Rule out other differentials.
 2. Dermatohistopathology: extensive epidermal ulcer-

also have a subepidermal band of dermal fibrosis
extending peripherally from the ulcer.
Treatment and Prognosis

CHAPTER 7 I Hypersensitivity Disorders
Canine Eosinophilic Furunculosis of the Face
Features
Canine eosinophilic furunculosis of the face is an acute,
usually self-limiting disease of the face. Although its
exact pathogenesis is not known, a hypersensitivity reac-
tion to insect stings or spider bites is suspected. It is
uncommon to rare in dogs, with the highest incidence
in inquisitive, young adult, medium-sized and large
dogs with ready access to the outdoors
 Blisters, erythematous papules and nodules, ulcer-
ation, crusts, and hemorrhage may develop acutely and
usually peak in severity within 24 hours. Lesions are
minimally pruritic to nonpruritic but may be painful
and typically involve the muzzle, bridge of the nose,
and periocular areas. Occasionally, the ventral abdomen,

Face. Alopecic, erythematous, erosive dermatitis with a moist
exudate is typical of eosinophilic furunculosis.
Top Differentials
Differentials include nasal pyoderma, dermatophytosis,
demodicosis, and autoimmune skin diseases.
Diagnosis
1. History clinical findings, and rule out other
differentials.
2. Cytology (blister, pustule, exudates): numerous
eosinophils are seen. Neutrophils and bacteria also
may be seen if lesions are secondarily infected.
3. Dermatohistopathology: eosinophilic perifolliculi-
tis, folliculitis, and furunculosis. Infiltration with
neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, along
with areas of dermal hemorrhage and collagen

the muzzle is apparent. Note that the nasal planum is usually
spared, thereby differentiating this disease from autoimmune
skin disease.
Treatment and Prognosis
1. Any secondary pyoderma should be treated with
 appropriate systemic antibiotics for 3 to 4 weeks.
2. Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg PO should be administered
every 24 hours, until lesions are markedly improved
(approximately 7-10 days); then, 1-2 mg/kg PO
should be administered every 48 hours for 10 more
days.
3. Hot packs and hydrotherapy may speed clinical
improvement.
4. The prognosis is good. Without glucocorticoid treat-
ment, spontaneous recovery usually occurs within 3
weeks, but systemic prednisone hastens resolution
of the lesions.

 Pinnal alopecia is uncommon in cats and is charac-
terized by periodic episodes of nonpruritic pinnal alo-
pecia. Siamese cats are predisposed. The alopecia may
be patchy or may involve most of the pinna, and both
ears are usually involved. Except for alopecia, the skin
is otherwise normal.

Ichthyosis
Features
Ichthyosis is a congenital keratinization disorder. It is
rare in dogs, with West Highland White terriers, Golden
retrievers, Cavalier King Charles spaniels, Doberman
pinschers, Jack Russell terriers, Norfolk terriers, and
Yorkshire terriers possibly predisposed. Dogs are abnor-
mal at birth, and one or more puppies in the litter may
be affected.
 Most of the body is covered with tightly adhering
scales, which may flake off in large sheets or accumulate
as seborrheic debris on the surface of the skin. The skin
may be erythematous and alopecic. Marked hyperkera-
tosis of the nasal planum and footpads, especially at the
margins of the pads, is typical. The feet may be swollen

CHAPTER 10 I Congenital Diseases
Cutaneous Mucinosis
Features
Cutaneous mucinosis is an idiopathic condition charac-
terized by an excessive accumulation or deposition of
dermal mucin. It is rare in dogs, except for Chinese Shar
pei dogs
It appears as mild, moderate, or severe exaggeration
 of skin folds, especially on the head, ventrum, and distal
extremities. Affected skin is puffy, thickened, and non-
pitting. Clear vesicles and bullae that contain a viscous,
sticky fluid (mucin) may be present. If the oropharynx
 is involved, upper respiratory stridor may be present.
Top Differentials

and autoimmune and immune-mediated skin disorders
for vesicular lesions.
Diagnosis
1. Signalment, history, clinical findings, and rule out
other differentials.
2.
Cytology (vesicle, bulla): amorphous, acellular,
basophilic substance (mucin).
3. Dermatohistopathology: excessive dermal mucin,
with no other histologic abnormalities.
Treatment and Prognosis
1. Any concurrent skin disease, such as atopy, food
hypersensitivity, pyoderma, or yeast dermatitis,
should be identified and treated because it may
contribute to the development of vesicles.
FIGURE 10-27 Cutaneous Mucinosis. Multiple mucin-filled

 ment is reasonable because skin changes resolve
spontaneously by 2 to 5 years of age in most Chinese
Shar pei dogs.
 3. For severely affected dogs, treatment with predniso-
lone 1-2 mg/kg PO every 24 hours for 7 days, fol-
lowed by a gradual reduction in dosage over 30 days,
may reduce mucin accumulation. Most dogs need
 only one course of treatment, but some may require
 repeated treatments or continuous low-dose mainte-
nance therapy.
4. The prognosis is good. This is primarily a cosmetic
problem, which most dogs eventually outgrow. Dogs
with oropharyngeal mucinosis are anesthetic risks
and should be monitored carefully during adminis-
tration of anesthesia to prevent respiratory arrest.

however, Golden retrievers and spaniel breeds are
 possibly predisposed.
Dorsal Dermoid Sinus
The sinus has single or multiple small openings that
may have tufts of hair protruding from them. This
opening may be found anywhere along the dorsal
midline but is most common over the cervical spine. A
cord of tissue that extends from the cutaneous opening
toward the spinal cord may be palpable. The sinus may
contain sebum, keratin, debris, and hair. Sinuses may
become inflamed, secondarily infected, or cystic, and
may drain; if they extend to the spinal cord, this may
lead to bacterial meningoencephalitis.

Vitiligo
Features
Vitiligo is an asymptomatic condition that is character-
ized by one or more macular areas of depigmented skin
(leukoderma)  or depigmented hair (leukotrichia).
Lesions are usually first noted in young adulthood and
often affect the nose, lips, face, buccal mucosa, and
footpads. It is uncommon in dogs, with the highest
incidence in Belgian Tervurens, German shepherds,
Rottweilers, and Dobermann pinschers. It is rare in cats,
with the highest incidence in Siamese cats.

Diagnosis

except no melanocytes are seen. A transient inflam-
matory phase may be observed.
Treatment and Prognosis
1. No treatment has been consistently documented in
veterinary species; however, treatments used for
autoimmune skin diseases (pemphigus and lupus)
 may be beneficial.
2. The prognosis is good. This is a cosmetic disease that
does not affect the animal's quality of life. The depig-

Malignant melanomas may have less pigment and

arranged in clusters, cords, or nervelike whorls and
 have variable degrees of pigmentation. Infiltration of

3. For anal sacculitis, anal sacs should be expressed
manually and lavaged with 0.025% chlorhexidine or

induced lesions.
Tumors can occur in the dermis (especially of the
ventral glabrous skin) or subcutaneous tissue. Tumors
may appear clinically similar to hemangioma (bluish to
reddish-black plaques or nodules <4 cm), or they can
present as poorly defined, subcutaneous, spongy, dark
red to black masses that measure up to 10 cm in diam-
eter. Alopecia, bleeding, and ulceration are common.
Hemostatic abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia
and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may
occur. Lesions occur most commonly on the limbs and
trunk in dogs, and on the head, ears, ventral trunk, and
distal limbs in cats.
Diagnosis
1. Cytology (may be nondiagnostic): mostly blood
with neoplastic endothelial cell that vary in appear-
ance from normal to large, pleomorphic cells with
basophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli.
2. Dermatohistopathology: dermal or subcutaneous
infiltrative mass of atypical pleomorphic hyperchro-
matic spindle cells with a tendency to form vascular
channels. Mitotic rate is variable.
3. Affected animals should be screened for internal
neoplasia and other sites of metastasis (thoracic

Lipoma
459
Lipoma
Features
A lipoma is a benign neoplasm of subcutaneous (occa-
sionally dermal) lipocytes. It is common in middle-aged
to older dogs, especially Dobermanns, Labradors, and
miniature Schnauzers. It is uncommon in older cats,
with Siamese cats possibly predisposed.
Lipoma manifests as single to multiple movable,
well-circumscribed, dome-shaped to multilobulated,
soft to firm, subcutaneous masses that range from 1 to
30 cm in diameter. Less commonly, tumors may be
large, soft, poorly circumscribed masses that infiltrate
underlying muscle, tendons, and fascia (infiltrative
lipoma). Lesions most often occur on the thorax,
abdomen, and limbs.
Diagnosis
1. Cytology: aspirates have an oily appearance grossly
and often are dissolved in alcohol-containing stains,
leaving clear areas with variable numbers of lipo-
cytes containing pyknotic nuclei, which are com-

globules.
2. Dermatohistopathology: well-circumscribed nodules
composed of solid sheets of mature lipocytes that
may have a capsule of mature fibrous tissue. Mitotic
figures are not present. Infiltrative lipomas are com-
posed of sheets of mature lipocytes, which spread
along fascial planes into muscle bundles and con-
nective tissule.
Treatment and Prognosis
1. For small, well-circumscribed tumors, observation
without treatment is reasonable.
2. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for cos-
 metically unacceptable or rapidly enlarging tumors.
3. Infiltrative lipomas should be treated with early
aggressive surgery, which can be followed by adjunc-
tive radiation, if excision is incomplete.
 4. The prognosis is good for well-encapsulated lipomas.
The prognosis is guarded for infiltrative lipomas,
which often recur postsurgically. Infiltrative lipomas

Tumor location is also prognostically important;
tumors in the inguinal, perineal, and subungual
regions, on the muzzle, and in the oral or nasal
cavity frequently metastasize, whereas appendicular
tumors tend to have a better prognosis. Breed can

Cutaneous Horns
Features
A cutaneous horn is a circumscribed, conical or cylindri-
cal mass of keratin that may originate from underlying
actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, papilloma,
a dilated pore, or infundibular keratinizing acanthoma.
 It also may be seen as a unique entity on the footpads
of cats infected with feline leukemia virus. Multiple
cutaneous horns arising from under the claws have also
been described in feline leukemia virus-negative cats.
The condition is uncommon in dogs and cats.
Single or multiple conical to cylindrical hornlike
masses of firm keratin are several millimeters in diam-
eter and up to 2 cm in length.
Diagnosis

papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia from which a
compact column of keratin protrudes, resembling a
toenail. The epidermis of feline leukemia-associated
cutaneous horns may show dyskeratotic or multi-
nucleate keratinocytes.
2. Cats with footpad lesions should be screened for
feline leukemia virus infection.
Treatment and Prognosis
1. The treatment of choice is complete surgical
excision.
2. Although cutaneous horns themselves are benign,
 the prognosis is variable, depending on the underly-
ing cause.

Bacterial Dermatitis-bird, ferret
Features
It is not common for birds to present with a bacterial
dermatitis unless it is involving the plantar surface of
the foot, as described under ulcerative pododermatitis,
or there is underlying trauma that allowed the infection
to start; if present, this generally involves gram-negative
bacteria. A ferret developed suspected allergy and sec-
ondary Pseudomonas spp. dermatitis after the owner
built it a cage made of redwood. After removal of the
new homemade cage and appropriate antibiotic treat-
 ment, the ferret made a complete recovery.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis usually involves aerobic and anaerobic
  oe u  s e an
biopsy, or fungal culture. No allergy testing has been
reported in ferrets. In this case, suspicion was high
because the disease occurred after exposure to the new
cage.
Treatment and Prognosis
Clean and debride the wound; this is sometimes
repeated over the course of days. Primary closure is
performed once infection is controlled. Birds' hetero-
phils lack myeloperoxidase, an enzyme that liquefies
pus; therefore do not place drains in the wound. Con-

Shell Repair—turtfe, tortoise
535
Shell Repair-turtle, tortoise
Features
Wild and captive turtles may require shell repair after
trauma from a car or from being chewed by a dog. The
top shell is called the carapace, and the bottom shell is
called the plastron. Both are made of bone covered with
a thin layer of keratin. If the pigmented keratin is
missing, the white bone underneath will be exposed.
Fractures occur through both bone and keratin.
Diagnosis
Sometimes radiographs are needed, but rarely, because
the bone of the shell is external.
Treatment and Prognosis

Various treatment options are available, including (1)

(2) using bone plates with screws, (3) applying the glue/
epoxy attachment of braces or an upside-down screw or
anything that the cerclage wire can be wrapped around,
or (4) using 5-minute epoxy with fiberglass mesh or
plumber's epoxy to bridge the fracture gap. A fracture
must be sterile if it is to be covered completely by a
repair. Systemic antibiotics and pain relievers are given.
