total of 7.2 millior1 pet cats
Congenital and hereditary disease
1.1.3
Arimals borr1 with ariy defect have congenital disease, which1
does riot hiave to be hieritable
Heritable disease may riot be seeri uritil later iri life, e.g. mitral
valve disease iri Cavalier Kirig Chiarles spariiels.
Thie same phieriotype, e.g. cleft palate, car1 occur bothi as a
heritable arid rori-bieritable corigerital defect ir1 cats.
If a litter is borri withi or develops a defect, thie hiallmark of
hieritable disease is thiat orily a proportiori of thie litter is
affected by ari ideritical defect.
 If all or most of a litter is affected arid thie defects are differerit,
this irdicates ar irisult in ufero, rot geretic defects.
Genetic defects
1.1.4
Gerietic defects cari be:
Breed related: whiere thie fact ofbeirig of thiat breed
 predisposes thie arimal to a disease (e.g. brachiycephialic
airway syridrome iri bulldogs) arid breedirg out a defect
would chiarige thie breed beyorid recogriitior1
 Breed defects: defect is widespread iri multiple liries withir1
thie breed, e.g. flat chiests in Bummese, hip dysplasia ir1
retrievers.
A defect reported iri a breed: marly defects thiat are reported
 as breed defects hiave orily appeared iri a few irdividuals or
specific liries withiri thie breed. However, thie true prevalerice
of thie gerietic teridericy withiir1 thie breed may be masked by
iridividuals lack of expressiori, e.g. crariofacial malforma-
tiori (USA Bummese; riot UK).
Genetic screening
1.1.5
 Tests are available for ari iricreasirig rumber of diseases, such1
as polycystic kidriey disease iri Persiaris, or vori Willebrard
disease.
Thie limitatioris of thie particular test shiould be recogrized.
Some gerietic tests actually ideritify thie defect (most reliable)
whiereas othiers ideritity geriotypes thiat are associated with1
thie disease arid are less reliable.
 Some tests ideritify gerietic traits suchi as dog leukocyte

BASIC APPROACHES
PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
1.1.6
6Vaccinology
Principles: vacciriatiori primes thie immurie resporise. If wild-
type irifectiori is ericouritered, a rapid aramriestic resporse
occurs: as a result, a protective immurie resporise occurs before
thie irifectious agert hias multiplied to a level whichi would
cause clirical sigris.
Vacciries for allergic arid rieoplastic disease are riot preverita-
tive, but are aimed at modifyirig thie immurie resporise.
Vacciriatiori is riot 100% safe or effective.
Severe vaccirie reactioris are rare, althiough lorig-term risks
associated withi vacciriatior1 are riot fully uriderstood but do
exist, e.g. vaccire-associated sarcoma ir1 cats.
Vacciriatior1 hias also beer1 loosely associated withi immurie-
mediated diseases.
Vaccirie failure cari be due to:
Ariimal factors, e.g. already iricubatirig disease or strorig
materrially-derived immuriity.
Disease factors, e.g. riew strairis or weighit of irfectiorl.
irappropriate storage or delivery.
Vaccination schedules vary withi vaccirie mariufacturer.
 Thie aim of puppy/kitteri courses is to achieve early vacciriatiorl
to allow socializatior1.
Primary course is gerierally 2 vacciries 3-4 weeks apart withi
thie 2rid vacciriatiori at 10-12 weeks old.
  Modifed live vacciriatiori of very yourig puppies ard
kitteris risks causirig the primary disease.
  Not all puppies arid kitteris resporid to thie primary course
(e.g. 65% to distemper). A first booster at 15 morithis is vital
to cover all iridividuals.
 Note thiat duratiori of immuriity for distemper/parvovinus
vacciratior1 deperids ori thie mariufacturer, but will be a
mirimum of 2-3 years.
 Vaccine types: modified live vinus (replicatiori atteruated);
killed adjuvarited; gerietically-ergirieered, coritairirig part of
thie agerit (adjuvarited or irserted iri a replicatior-deficierit

Parasite control
1.1.7
Virtually all puppies arid kitteris will be borri with1, or acquire
churing suckling, a parasite load. Low-level parasitism is also
commori iri adult dogs arid cats: thioughi rarely of great clirical
sigrificarice, it does pose a public-biealthi risk.
 It is thierefore importarit to develop a clear, practice-based
womirig policy for puppies arid kitters, adult dogs arid cats,
arid pregriarit bitchies arid queers.

■Growth
Pre-weaning: ideally dam's milk, if riot thiern fosterirg.
 Harid rearirg requires proprietary milk substitute.
Post-weaning: puppy S0%; kitter1 75% of adult weighit by 6
morithis.
 Maximal growthi does not meari optimal growth1.
Puppies require eriergy derise, highily digestible food.
The amourit arid balarice of vitamiris/minerals, particularly
calcium arid phiosphorus, are importarit especially for giart
breeds.
Kittens are best fed ad fibifum.
 Eriergy requiremerits per kg peak at 10 weeks, but are lower
thiar1 for puppies, as thie perceritage iricreases over birth1
weighit are less.
Maintenance hias few requiremerits outside of a balariced diet.
 Cats arid small dogs reachi adult requiremerits at 12 morithis;
medium dogs 15-18 morithis arid giarit breeds 18-24
morithis.
Gestation requires iricreased feedirg as follows:
 For dogs iri Sthi-9thi weeks (whieri most foetal weighit gair1
     e    '(s
of hiighier derisity foods.
For cats feed ad lib: if portiori-fed, iricrease by 4S% per
week.
13
BASIC APPROACHES
 Lactation makes a huge rutritiorial demarid, peaking at 4
weeks postpartum. Small meals of highly palatable, highily
digestible food required for bitchies, ad libifum feedirig of
queeris is recommerided.
Additiorial vitamiris/mirierals are nof riecessary if diet is
balariced.
Activity: a S km ruri iricreases a dog's requiremerits by orily
10%! Gerierally, workirig dogs rieed a highily palatable, eriergy
derise (fat), highily digestible arid rutritiorially-balariced diet.
Old age requiremerts are poorly defiried.
 Iritestiral furictiori decliries from 8 years of age.
It is gerierally felt thiat lower riutritiorial derisity is required,
 as eriergy demarids decrease due to reduced levels of activity
arid lower lear1 body mass.
Vitamiri arid aritioxidarit requiremerit may be iricreased
 Palatability is importarit as appetite cari be reduced.
 Iricrease feeding frequericy.
1.1.10 Feeding the hospitalized patient
Nutritiori rieeds to be addressed if thie patierit is severely
iriappetarit/ariorexic for >3 days.
 If food marnipulatior1 or hiarid-feedirig fails, thier1 corisider
 appetite stimularits (see table) or tube feedirig.
Tube-feeding techniques
 Nasoesophageal fube: use withi coriscious or lighitly sedated
patierit. Iriappropriate if vomitirig, oesophiageal disease,
uricoriscious patierit.
Tube measured to 9thi rib (cat); to 7thi iritercostal space (dog).
Nostril deserisitized arid tube (6-16 Fr) advariced iri a veritral

of reasor1s.
■
 If parts of thie phiysical examiriatiori carriot be completed,

thie owrier are calm arid co-operative.
■
 Treat seriously ariy owrier accourits of previous isses withi

■Ask thie owrier if thieir pet will react better if thie owrier hiolds it;
 or whiethier you shiould ask a rurse to hielp.
■
 Corisider examiririg dogs ori thie floor: some dogs will be more

Heart and respiratory rates
  Refererice rariges for hieart arid repiratory rates are shiowri iri thie

should also be appropriate for thie situatior1.
 For example riormal dogs asleep cari hiave hieart rates less
thiari 30/miri arid pauses of 4 5 secorids.
■A hieart rate of 60/miri iri thie corisultirig room iri a highily

Thie hieart rhiythim, chiaracter of thie pulse arid respiratory effort

BASIC APPROACHES
LABORATORY TESTS
1.3.1
Haematology
 Precise refererice rariges will vary betweeri laboratories arid ir1-
biouse machiries; breed- ard age-specific variatioris also occur.
■
 Moderate to marked chiariges are more likely to be clirnically
sigrificarit arid relate to a primary disease process. Mild
chiariges (especially ir1 older ariimals) are commor1, may be
difficult to explairi, arid may reflect disease elsewhiere.
■
 Haematocrit (HCT) from most automated machiries (derived
parameter = RBCC × MCV) approximates to PCV. It cari be
sigrificaritly highier thiar1 PCV if thie red-cell courit is elevated,
or ir1 postal samples whiere red cell swellirig raises MCV.

1.3.3 Other tests
 Ir1 additiori to biochiemistry arid hiaematology, othier tests may
 be appropriate whieri preserited withi patierits withi sigr1s
suggestinig:
■
GIT disease: full faecal arialysis, vitamiri B2 arid folate,
trypsiri-like immrioreactivity (TLI), paricreatic-specific
lipase, ACTH stimulatior test (to rule out atypical hiypo-
adreriocorticism as a calse of GI sigris)
24
1.3 Diagnostic techniques
Renal disease: uririalysis iricluding UPC arid culture,
estimate GFR, erythiropoietiri level, acid/base status.
Liver disease: dyriamic bile acid testirig, blood ammoria,
bile cytology arid culture, clottirig profile.
Cardiac disease: cardiac troporir I, NT-proBNP, tauririe.
 Anaemia: reticulocyte courit, erythiropoietir level, irori arid
iror1 biridirig level.
Unexplained lymphocytosis: flow cytometry.
Hormonal tests
1.3.4
■Marry hiomories, e.g. parathiyroid homorie (PTH), require
careful hiaridlirig, as thiey are easily destroyed duririg samplirig
or postage; chieck requiremerits.
 ACTH stimulation test for hyper- arid hypoadrerio-
corticism: measure basal cortisol, iriject tetracosactide
(Syriacthier) i/v or i/m arid measure cortisol after 4S-60
mirites.
For a dog weighing >10 kg use 0.25 mg (1 vial); weighirig
<10 kg, use a half-vial.
 Cats shiould be sampled at 1 arid 3 hiours, use a hialf-vial
tetracosactide.
Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) for
hyperadreriocorticism: give 0.01 mg/kg (dog) 0.1 mg/kg (cat)
i/v dexamethiasorie sodium phiosphiate, arid measure at 0, 3
arid 8 hirs.
For accuracy, dilute dexamethasone to 0.2 mg/m solution with
water for injection and use an insulin syringe.
Highi-dose dexamethiasorie suppressiori test (HDDST) to
distiriguishi pituitary vs. adrerial deperiderit disease: give
0.1 mg/kg (dog) 1.0 mg/kg (cat) dexamethasorie i/v ard
measure as LDDST
 TSH stimulation test for hiypothyroidism: iniject
recombiriarit humari TSH S0 ug i/v arid measure thiyroxiri at
O arid 6 hirs

■ Gerietic testirig is most valuable for breedirig programmes arid
for iridividual patierits withi a specific diagriosis.
Iricreasirig rumbers of tests are being offered, e.g. for polycystic
kidriey disease iri Persiarl cats. Thie amourit of validatiori thiat
hias beer1 uridertaker1 for a particular test is very variable.
Courisellirig of owriers before gerietic testirig is importarit.
A positive result irdicates thie gerietic potenfial to develop thie

BASIC APPROACHES
1.3.6 Urinalysis
 Defiritioris: hiypostheruric = SG <1.008; isosthieruric =
1.007-1.015; hyperstheruric = >1.015.
Collection: cathieter samples are rarely justified.
 For cats, free catch usirig polystyrerie packirg, plastic beads
(e.g. Katkor) or washied fishi-tarik gravel.
For dogs mid-stream uririe flow is preferred.
■
Cystocentesis allows accurate full uririalysis - serid iri a plair1
tube.
If thiere is gross hiaematuria ori uririatiorl, compare a cysto-
ceritesis sample withi a free catchi, as thiis will hielp localize thie
area that is bleedirig.
 Dipsticks are desigried for hiumaris: SG, leucocytes, proteir1
ritrite arid urobiliriogerl cari be urireliable or of rio value.
SG shiould be measured with1 a refractometer.

1.3 Diagnostic techniques
Sedirment: shiould be iriactive - few cells arid rio casts.
 More thiari orie or two casts per low power field usually
iridicates damage to rerial tubules.
Preserice of bacteria reported iri sedimerit does riot
demoristrate uririary irifectior.
 Irifectiori must be corifimed by culture as mis
ideritificatiori rate is hiighi.
■Culture: positive orl cystoceritesis, or >10cfu/ml ori free-
catchi/cathieter, would be sigrnificarit results.
Urine proteirr:creatinine ratio gives a better estimate of
proteiruria:
For dogs, a ratio of <0.4 is riomal, >0.6 would be abriomal.
For cats, a ratio of <0.2 is riommal, >0.4 would be abriomal.
Urine cortisol:creatinine ratio car be a useful riegative rule out
for hyperadreriocorticism.
■For dogs thie ratio should be < 20 × 106.
For cats thie ratio shiould be <50 × 106.
Sample collection and preparation
1.3.7
Correct samplirig arid hiaridlirig are vital to obtairi valid results.
■
Blood sarmples: a O.S ml sample is usually sufficierit; see table,
below left, for those tests which1 rieed more.
Urinalysis: requires a sample >S ml. Orily use boric acid tube if
free-catchi for culture.
Fire-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB): use a 2lg reedle; take
multiple samples usirig eithier a rieedle-irisert techirique
withiout suctior1, or suctiori withi a 5 ml syririge.
Remember to release thie suctiori pressure before removirg
thie rieedle, as this reduces thie likelihiood of suckirig material
irito thie syririge thiat carrot be retrieved.
 Storage iri thie fidge or iri thie same package as fomaliri
reduces quality of FNAB slides.
■
Biopsy: try to gairi material from advaricirig edge of a lesior1 or
mass.
Ersure adequate formaliri is used (10 × volume of biopsy).
 If thie biopsy is large, sectiori irito 10 mm strips.

Diagnostic tests and objectives
3.1.3
■ Schirmer tear testing: place the shiort erid of thie tip irl
lateral half oflower corijurictival sac bioldirg the eyelid closed.
Measure over 1 mirute. Cats ard dogs shiould produce
12-27 mm, but breed variatiors do occur.
Fluorescein demorstrates ulceratior1 arid rasolacrimal patericy.
Note thiat deep ulcers do riot stairi ceritrally; mucus ori thie
corrieal surface cari give a 'false positive'.
Blood tests primarily serve to look for systemic coriditioris
calsirig ocuular sigris.
■Cytology and histology cari provide valuable infommatior1 in1
diseases affectirig thie eyelid, corijurictiva arid corriea.
■ Culture: aerobic bacterial culture is appropriate for thie
majority of suspected irifectioris. Special trarsport media are
required for Chlamydophila arid Mycoplasma.
 Furigal disease shiould be corisidered iri arimals thiat hiave
travelled abroad.
Imaging: ultrasourid, CT arid MRI are valuable for irivestigatirig
disease of thie deeper strctures of thie eye, retrobulbar area arid
optic rierve.
Radiographis hiave limited value, except to detect radio-
 opaque foreigri bodies arid diseases affectirig thie orbital

Electroretinographry evaluates retiral furiction but requires
gerteral ariaesthiesia.
TREATMENT
Topical ocular products

Alveolar pattern (above left) is caused by fillirg of thie alveoli

derse towards thie ceritre of thie area, withi ar ill-defiried edge as

wliere all thie alveoli are filled, ar1 air brorichiogram is created.
Bronchial paftern (above righit) occurs whier1 thie brorichiial
wall is promirierit (iriflammatior1, fibrosis, calcificatiori) or
thiere is peribrorichial irifiltratiorl.

lorigitudirial airways are described as 'tramliries'
h1 acute brorichial disease thie edge of thie wall terids to be
thiicker, less radioderise arid less well defiried.
Iri chiroriic disease thie wall terids to be brighiter arid more

 Interstitial patterns are calsed by diseases thiat affect thie
 support tissue of thie lurigs. This is seeri eithier as a diffuse

iricreased arid structures suchi as thie blood vessels become less

INTRODUCTION
3.4.1A
Acute/chronic gastrointestinal disease
■ GIT disease preserits iri bothi acute arid chiroric forms; for
approachies see 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 arid 2.12.
Withi acute disease, thie key questiori is whiethier thie problem is
self-limitirig. For suchi cases thiere will be a shiort history arid a
kriowri excitirig cause; thie patierit will be systemically well
withi good appetite, arid thiere will be riegative phiysical
firidirigs. However, if the problem is severe, thie patiert is
usually uriwell withi positive phiysical firidirigs iridicative of GIT
disease; sichi cases require immediate irivestigatior1
For chronic or recurrent disease thie key is to follow a
logical pathi of irivestigatior arid treatmerit (preferably
moriothierapy) so thiat effective mariagemerit is evertually
achieved.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
3.4.2 Key questions and examination tips
History is crucial, especially iri chiroriic disease whiere thiere may
be mirimal physical firdirgs. Descriptiori of thie sigris whier1
thie disease first begar1 is ofteri thie most hielpful.
r1 patierits thiat are 'vomitirig', it is esseritial to be certairi thie
owrier is riot describing regurgitatior, gagging, dysphiagia,
expectoratior1 or retchirig. Ori rare occasioris, patierits will
shiow a combiratiori of sigris.
Regurgitated material (alkalirie) cari be distiriguishied from
vomitus (acidic) by measuririg thie pH, usirig litmus paper.
 Ii vomitirig cases, thie relatioriship to feedirig arid thie riature
of thie vomitus are importarit.
 Phrysical examinatior: improved access to thie abdomerl carl

Small iritestirial diarrhioea is chiaracterized by iricreased fatty

is characterized by iricreased frequericy, urgericy, teriesmus,
mucus arid freshi blood.
DIAGNOSIS
Preliminary diagnostic tests
3.4.3
 Full faecal examiriatiori is esseritial iri cases of chiroriic
diarrhioea.
Routire hiaematology arid biochiemistry are of limited value
ir1 chiroric disease, but importarit iri acute disease whiere thie
patierit is systemically uriwell. Iri suchi cases it will hielp to
exclude riori-GIT disease as thie uriderlyirig cause, as well as
documeritirig ariy metabolic corisequerices of the disease

■ GIT-focused blood tests iriclude:
TLI, PLI, amylase arid lipase - see paricreatitis (3.4.7).
 Folate arid cobalamiri - chiariges outside of thie refererice
rarige cari be supportive of GIT disease.

Adverse reactions to food cari be imuriologically-based or
riori-immuriologic (pliammacologically active microrutrierits
suchi as caffeirie or thieophiyllirie, hiistamirie iri chieap fish1 as
well as preservatives, additives arid dyes arid toxic coritamiria-
tiori from bacteria or chiemicals)
Dietary hypersensitivity: typical sigris are weighit loss,
vomitirig arid diarrhioea. 10% of cases hiave pruritic skir1
disease. Irivestigate by elimiriatiori diet as follows.
Diet shiould coritairi a riovel proteiri arid carbohydrate
source. It cari be commercial (sirigle source proteiri or
hiydrolyzed) or home-cooked (e.g. boiled white fishi arid
sweet potato).
Strict adhiererice is esseritial. Most cases likely to resporid will
start to do so ir1 12 weeks.
Resporiders shiould ideally be corfimed by rechiallerige.
■Acute vomiting and diarrhoea: prescribe Gl rest for 24 hiours
ir1 patierits thiat are systemically well, thieri iritroduce a 'blarid'
diet -palatable, low fat, highily digestible, low residue. For
home-cooked food, proteiri:carboliydrate ratio =1:1 (cat);: 1:2
(dog). Malriutritiori cari occur withi frequerit starvatiori; feedirig
thirough episodes is advised.
■Protein losing enteropathry (PLE): give iricreased levels of hiigh1
biological value proteir1, iricreased carbohiydrates as ari eriergy
source arid reduced fat (<4% DM). Give iricreased fat-soluble
(A, D arid E) vitamiris.
■ Colitis: similar diets as for dietary hypersersitivity; for chiroric
cases, iricreasirig fibre may hielp
Faecal incontinence: mariage withi low residue diets.
■Constipation caririot be treated by diet. However, thie
likelibiood of recurrerce cari be reduced by usirig irisoluble fibre
to iricrease faecal bulk arid stimmulate defecatior1, while
producirig a softer stool.
4 tsp of a highi-fibre breakfast cereal per 100 g of food
iricreases thie fibre coriterit of a diet by ≥ 10%.
Probiotics (cultured bacteria) arid prebiotics (soluble fibre
e.g. fmucto-oligosacchiaride) hiave a role iri thie mariagemerit of

Primary correctiori of acidosis is rarely required.
 Coritrol uraemic damage to GIT: use aritacids arid sicralfate.
■ Coritrol vomitirig: use metoclopramide (riot withi dopamirie

Provide aritibacterial cover, as uraemic patierits are immurio-
compromised.
Peritorieal dialysis is possible, but techirically chiallerigirig.
Haemodialysis is available iri some couritries.
Treatment tips
Always place a uririary cathieter arid measure output 1-2 hiourly.
 Fluids arid diuretics are thie corrierstorie of treatmerit.
 If thiere is oliguria or aruria, avoid over-hydratior, particularly

 Disease types and bladder innervation
 Lower uririary tract (LUT) diseases fall irito 3 mairi groups:
cystitis (pollakiuria) (2.8), iricoritirierice (2.10) ard obstructior1
(5.7).
■Neurologic coritrol of bladder furictior1 is mediated by thie
hypogastric, puderidal arid pelvic rierves (see diagram below).
Spirial cord damage may affect bladder furictior1, deperidirig or1
its locatior1. Damage above L4-LS terids to cause a spastic
bladder arid inability to uririate, while damage to thie spirie
below L4 LS causes a flaccid overflow bladder.

3.8.2
Vital history questions
Neuteririg status shiould always be chiecked, as mistakes ir1
records are relatively commorl.
■ Iri iritact patierits, a full reproductive history is vital, as thie
approach to patierits thiat hiave previously mated successfully is
differerit to thiose thiat hiave riot.
 It is assumed thiat patierits thiat hiave previously mated suc-
cessfully do riot hiave hiereditary or corigerital ariatomic or
gerietic abriomalities thiat would preverit coriceptiorl.
However, thiey may hiave acquired disease, e.g. eridometritis;
be iricompatible withi thieir chioser1 mate; or hiave developed
issues with thieir reproductive cycle.
■ Iri bitchies, a descriptior1 of thieir cyclirig frequericy arid lerigth1,
arid behiaviour duririg oestrs shiould be obtairied.
DIAGNOSIS

3.8.4 Monitoring the oestrous cycle in bitches
■
Thie stage of thie oestrous cycle cari be mornitored by plasma
progesterorie, or by vagirial cytology.
Plasma progesterorie (see table above righit):
 if rise from < 1 rig/ml to 2-4 rg/ml, ovulatiori iri about 2
days (iricreased frequericy of samples ircreases accuracy).

■ Gerietic predispositioris exist iri specific dog arid cat breeds.
Trarisierit diabetes occurs iri about 20% of cats arid cari be
associated withi oestrus ini dogs.
Dogs: rearly always type 1 diabetes due to a failure of
paricreatic islet cell productiori of irisulir1.
■ Cats: mix of type 1 arid 2, i.e. reduced irisuliri productiori with1
iricreased erid-orgar1 resistarice to irisuliri. Suchi cases still
require irisulir thierapy.

4.3.2 MINIMIZING SURGICAL INFECTION
Environnent
■ Use the operatirig thieatre orily for surgery.
 Cleari every morririg arid everirg (betweeri every surgery if
possible)
 IHeally, prepare patierits (e.g. clippirg, clearirg, ariaesthietizirig)
iri a separate room.
Erisure adequate lighitirig arid, ideally, filtered, positive pressure
vertilatiorl, especially for advariced orthiopaedics.
■ Pari thie surgical list: cleariest surgery first, firishiirig thie erid of
thie list withi thie irifected or 'dirty' surgeries.
Preparation of the patient
Clip a wide area thiat allows for movemerit of skiri irito thie
surgical field durirg closure.
Vacuum or brushi thie loose hiairs off tlhie coat arid cover feet
withi a waterproof drape to preverit strikethirough1.
 Use aritiseptic scrub for skiri preparatiori (chilorhiexidirie/
povidorie iodirie), ther alcohiol-based artiseptic spray.
Preparation of the surgeon
 Use a surgical cap arid also, ideally, a mask. Tallirig iricreases
thie risk of aerosol irifectior1!
 Use a staridard protocol to scrub hiarids, riail beds, ams; this
takes S miriutes.
 Use sterile gloves arid gowris for every surgery.
■ Chiarige clothies used for corisultirg, hiouse visits, or othier
procedures irito cleari scrubs arid shioes for thie operatirig area.

Use swabs withi x-ray-detectable thireads for abdomirial
surgery.
Courit your swabs orito thie trolley arid out of thie
arimal.
Contamination:if tissues become coritamirated during
surgery, lavage thie surgical site withi sterile salirie prior to
closure.
Wam sterile salirie (large volumes) is rieeded for abdomirial
lavage; remove withi suctiori prior to closure.
 If thie site is coritamiriated (e.g. strikethiroughi of drapes, GIT
surgery), chiarige gloves arid drapes prior to closure.
 Irifected or coritamiriated surgery: chiarige iristrumerits for
closure; dor't re-use suture materials used ori Gl/uririary tract.
HAEMOSTASIS
4.3.3
Haemostasis is importarit, especially ir1 irivasive or complex
surgery, ir1 order to achieve:
Shiorter surgery times.
A 'dry' surgical field, thiereby improvirig visibility arid
reducirig thie risk of iatrogernic irjury.
Reduced post-operative morbidity due to blood loss or
hypotersiorl.
 Less risk of urideritified bleedirig after abdomirial or thioracic
surgery.
  Improved tissue hiealirig, reduced post-operative oedema arid
less risk of irifectiorl.
Reduced post-operative mortality arid re-operatiori rates.
Wriole blood arid blood products are expersive arid ir1
relatively shiort supply arid are riot a substitute for hiaemostasis.
Ligatures: Suture material shiould be small gauge withi good
kriot security arid hiardlirg chiaracteristics - preferably a
syrithietic absorbable material.
Thie surgeori shiould be familiar withi thie techiriques used to
place ligatures withiout thie thirows ori thie kriot lockirig prior to

  Thie slidirig kriot is used to place a secure ligature, deep

4.3.4 APPROACH TO A LUMP
Assessment and planning

Not all lumps are rieoplastic (see 3.14).
For tumours before surgery, ideritify thie tumour type, arratomy

Tumour staging
■ Ascertairi primary tumour type arid grade. Thie most commorl
superficial cariirie tumours are lipomas, mast cells or soft-tissue
sarcomas.
Fre-rieedle aspiratiorn (FNA) is useful for irivestigatirig lipoma,
lymphioma arid mast-cell tumour; a riori-diagriostic FNA
suggests riori-rieoplastic disease or a sarcoma, so repeat FNA
or obtairi a biopsy.

Principles of oncologic surgery
Plari thie exterit of resectiori to remove thie palpable tumour arid
a surrouridirig area of riommal tissue, to erisure removal of all
tumour cells (see diagram, above). Highier-grade tumours
require a wider area of resectior1.
A lateral skir margir of 1-S cm (deperiding or1 tumour type
arid grade) arid a deep fascial layer is maridatory. Thie deep
margiri is thie most commor1 margiri for iricomplete excisiorl.
■
 Removirig masses withiout FNA or biopsy may lead to chioosirig
irappropriate margiris of resectior1.
■
 Shiellirig out' will orily remove thie grossy visible tumour tissue
arid recurrerice is likely.
Wourid recoristrctior1 after tumour resectiori may require
advariced surgical techiriques. Early referral for defiriitive
treatmerit is likely to hiave a better outcome thiarl referral after
resectiori with dirty margiris.
SUTURES
4.3.5
Suture materials
■
 Syrithietic suture materials are preferred to orgaric suture
(catgut) as they are removed by hiydrolysis, leadirg to a gradual
arid predictable loss of terisile strerigthi. Thie sture shiould be at

159
AnaEsthesIa, AnaLGeSIa And SuRGERY
 Moriofilamerit sutures liave miriimal drag arid fom tighit kriots
but are difficult to hiaridle. Coated moriofilamerit sutures are
easier to hiaridle, but may poteritiate irifectiorl arid will 'drag'
thiroughi tissue.
Absorbable syrithietic suture is gerierally used othier thiari for
skir1 sutures. A suture withi proloriged terisile strerigthi arid slow
absorptiori is appropriate for most situatioris, especially whiere
early tissue separatiori could be problem, e.g. liriea alba, blood
vessel ligatures, iritestiries.
Examples are polydioxariorie (PDS, Ethiicor1) arid
polyglycorate (Maxor1, Covidier1).
 Subcuticular sutures cari hiave more rapid loss of terisile
strerigthi arid absorptior1.
Example: poliglecaprorie (Moriocryl, Ethiicor1)
■Permanent syrithetic suture is used for skiri or whieri suture
absorptiori is problematic, e.g. peririeal rupture repair.
Example: rlylor1 (Moriosof, Covidier1)
Suture size
■ Suture size selectiori deperids ori thie size of arimal arid tissue to
be sutured. Large-gauge suture is to be avoided, as kriots are less
secure. Appropriate size selectiori would be:
Skir1/subcuticular tissue: 1.5-2 metric (4/0-3/0 USP).
Liriea alba: 3-3.S metric (2/0-0).
Vascular pedicles, e.g. ovary: 3-3.S metric (2/0-0)
Iritestiries: 1.S metric (4/0)
Suture technique
 Swaged-ori rieedles are preferred. Reverse cuttirig rieedles used

■The kriot is thie weakest part of a suture. A mirimum of 4
thirows is required for polydioxariorie arid riylor1, withi 1 arid
2-3 extra thirows, respectively, at the begiririrng arid erid of a
coritiruous suture. A square or surgeori's kriot is preferred arid
eachi thirow must be securely tighiteried.
Ligatures must be placed tighitly, whiichi may be aided withi thie

BANDAGES AND DRESSINGS
4.3.6
Wourids are dressed withi a primary (coritact) layer followed
Aey pe (uoudiosqe pe sped) iakel Areoas e Aq
a tertiary (protective) layer.
Primary layers: assess thie wourid arid determire thie effect
you warit for the coritact layer - protective, debridirg, or
actively promotirg healirig.
Secondary layers:
Use a soft wover1 baridage.
 Wrap everily, with1 about So% overlap of eachi turr1 of thie
baridage. Deperidirig ori thie level of support, thiis layer
may be orily 2-3 tums thick, or very hieavy (e.g. a Robert
Jories baridage).
Use ari exteridable, elastic, rior-adhererit baridage
(e.g. TreatRap? or equivalerit) to secure thie paddirg layer.
Thie riatural coritours of thie limb shiould be everied out, so
that the bardage is roughily the same diameter all the way
alorig; this reduces thie risk of bardage injury.
Tertiary layers:
Use a self-adhiererit, water-resistarit material (e.g. Vetrap).
  Apply withi ever1 terisiori - riot too tighitly - up arid dowr1
thie limb.
 Bandage injuriescan cause massive tissue loss, amputation or
death!
Complications are caused by thebandage slipping or being applied
too fightty or unevenly. The patient may chew at the dressing within
1-2 hours of application ifit is causing restriction of circulation.
All owners shoutd be provided with writtendischarge instructions on
bandage care,incfuding instructions to seek veterinary attention

Casts
 Splirits may be iricorporated irito a baridage to provide more
support, or a cast applied usirig a very thiri layer of paddirig
uriderrieathi.
Choose thie cast accordirig to cost, strergthi arid the size/age
of thie patierit.
  Thie owrier must hiave writteri irstructioris ori cast care arid
the darigers of igrioririg clirical sigris: swellirig of thie toes,

161
ANaESTheSIA, AnaLGESIa AnD SURGERY
The cast must be checked weekly by a veteririary surgeorl.
Casts used to support ligameritous irijuries may be split after
applicatiori arid chiariged weekly.
 Casts used to support fracture repair are usually riot chiariged
for 6 weeks, but must still be chiecked.
Casts placed or1 thie limbs of growirig ariimals may rieed to
be completely reapplied at least weekly, to allow riormmal

Assess thie injury:
口Take a history.
 Chieck for othier orgari irijuries.
 Chieck for deep damage, e.g. crushirig of muscle/borie irl

Probe perietratirig irijuries, especially over thie chiest arid
abdomerl.
Surgically explore bite wourids.
Coritrol irifectiort:
 Lavage withi large volumes (1-S l) of sterile fluid to
remove debris arid bacteria. Use ar1 18-21g rieedle arid a
 20-50 ml syrirge attachied to a 3-way tap-arid-drip lirte
arid applied withi fimm pressure. Aritiseptics are riot
reeded.
Surgically debride obviously riecrotic tissue daily as
required.
Use wet-to-dry dressirigs for furthier debridemerit.

 Promote a viable vascular bed by coritirued debridemerit
of wourids - surgical (as above), wet-dry dressirigs arid
active dressirigs.
Preverit furthier damage, particularly of hiealirg (grarulatiori)

POST-OPERATIVE CARE
4.3.8
Nursing: post-op patierits require wamth1, comfort, fluid
thierapy arid arialgesia. Delayed recovery may be due to
hiypothermia, hiypoterisior1, electrolyte imbalarice, pairi arid
fear, or dehiydratior1.
Anaigesin: reduces stress arid improves recovery. Opioids do
riot cause gastrointestirial ileus.
Nutritiorr: early rmutritiori is esseritial; there is rno indicatiorl
to withibiold food. Feedirig shiould be ericouraged as soorl as
possible after recovery, iricludirig after GIT surgery. Nausea
post-ariaesthietic/gastric surgery car1 be treated with1 prokiretics,
er1d of major surgery, ariorectic arimals shiould hiave a feedirig
tube placed.

Postoperative coimplications
 Complicatioris may be due to wourid, patierit or surgical
factors.
Seroma: a relatively commori complicatior1, especially wlier1
skiri lias beer1 uridermiried, or iri loose-skirired ariimals
arourid thie body folds or thie rieck. Most do riot require
treatmerit arid will resolve over several weeks. Needle
drairiage is discouraged, as thie seroma will re-fomm arid thiere
is a risk ofiatrogeric irifectior1. Large seromas may require
surgical drairi placemerit.
Surgical wound dehiscence: usually due to excessive wourid
terisior1. Othier causes include irifectior1, tighit sutures,
iriadequate arialgesia, excessive movemerit or self-trauma.
Most cases resporid well to operi wourid mariagemerit arid
bealirig by secorid iriteritiori. Re-suturirg is orily performed
if thie uriderlyirig cause of dehiscerice cari be overcome arid if
tissue is hiealthiy.
Infection: multi-drug-resistarit irifectioris, ircludirg
methicilliri-resistarit Staphyfococcus aureus (MRSA), are
occasiorially ericouritered; thieir mariagemerit is thie same as
for othier irifectioris. Use bacterial culture arid serisitivity to
choose aritimicrobial thierapy.
 Haemorrhage is usually due to poor surgical techirique arid
abdomirial cavity, e.g. after rieuteririg, may preserit with1
weakriess, collapse, pallor, slow recovery arid tachiycardia.
Aspiratiori of blood via abdomirioceritesis is diagriostic.
Followirig iritraverious fluid thierapy, emergericy surgery will
be required. Rarely, haemorrhage is due to clottirg disorders;
petechiae arid bleedirig from cathieter/veripuricture sites
may also be eviderit.
Peritonitis: dehiscerice of a gastroiritestiral iricisior1, ifit
occurs, is usually withiri 72 hiours of surgery arid will lead
to septic peritoritis. Iriappetarice arid vomitirg are early
preseritirig sigris, arid abdomirioceritesis yields fluid
coritairirg degerierate rieutrophils arid iritracytoplasmic
bacteria. Followirig iritraverious fluid thierapy, emergericy

4.4 0rthopaedics
Radiograpry is thie most valuable iritial irivestigatiorl
lameriess hias beeri localized.
Patiert shiould be sedated or ariaesthietized.
At least two views of eachi area are riecessary, arid preferably
also thie coritralateral limb for comparisor1.
Stressed, flexed arid exterided views may be hielpful.
 Good positioriirg arid radiographic techirique are esseritial.
Chiarges shiould be evaluated iri corijurictiori withi physical
firidirigs, age arid breed.
Joint fluid analysis: see 4.4.6
Ultrasound is iricreasirigly used to examirie soft-tissue
structures supportirig joirits/muscles; iriterpretatiori requires
experierice.
■ Advanced imaging. CT arid MRI offer advaritages over radio-
■Arthroscopy/arthrotormy are riecessary to fully evaluate some
cases withi joirit disease; thiey also allow thierapeutic iriterverl-
tior1. Thiey require specialist equipmert arid kriowledge to be
performed well.
Force plate with video analysis of gait measures thie force as
each limb is plarited, to better evaluate lameriess arid resporise
to treatmerit, while highi-speed video cameras are used to
arialyse gait.
■Scintigraphy: Techiretium is used to look for focal hiot spots'
affectirig thie borie/support tissues, suggestirig iriflammatior1.
CAUSES OF LAMENESS
Forelimb disease
4.4.4
 Nori-fracture, commorl calses of forelimb lameriess iriclude:
Carpal hiyperflexiori irijuries - tori ligamerits as a result of a
fall or trauma.
Forimmature dogs:
 Elbow dysplasia (cororioid, osteochioridritis dissecaris
[OCD], uriurnited aricorieal process, radioulriar
incorigruity).
 Aritebrachial growthi deformity suchi as carpal valgus.
 Shioulder OCD ir1 large arid giarit breeds.
For adult dogs:
 Elbow osteoarthiritis (OA) - usually secoridary to
dysplasia.
 Soft-tissue irijury of thie shioulder, suchi as ligamerit tear or
teriosyriovitis.

CCL
Tibial thrust test.The stifle is held in slight flexion.The index finger of
one hand is placed over the tibial crest and the other hand flexes and
extends the hock (1, 2). If the CCL is torn, the tibial tuberosity will move
very slightly cranially (3), when the hock is in the flexed position.
4.4.5 Hind-linb disease
Nori-fracture, commor1 causes of hirid-limb lameriess
iriclude the followinig:
Immature dogs
Hip dysplasia.
Medial patella luxatiorl:
Grade I - mariually displaces but sporitarieously reduces.
 Grade II - iritermittertly arid sporitarieously luxates,
resultirig iri a skippirig gait.

JOINT DISEASE
Degenerative joint disease (DJD)
4.4.6
■Osteoarthiritis associated withi DJD is thie most frequeritly
ccrririg joirit disease iri dogs arid cats. Diagriosis may require
radiographly or arthirocertesis (see below).
Differential diagnosis
Traumatic OA usually affects a sirigle joirit withi a history of
trauma.
 Septic OA usually affects sirigle joirits.
Polyarthiritic (immurie-mediated) OA:
Sufferers are usually systemically uriwell, shiowirig fever,
leucocytosis, iriappeterice arid/or reluctarice to exercise/
lethiargy - thie phieriomeriori of'walkirig ori eggshiells'
 Joirt swellirig arid pairi cari be subtle.
Polyarthiritic OA car1 be erosive or riori-erosive:
  Erosive polyarthiritis is similar to rhieumatoid arthiritis ir1
humaris. Iri dogs, this is diagriosed from radiographis, as
RF ini dogs is irisersitive arid riori-specific.
 Nori-erosive polyarthiritis iri its most commori fom is
secordary to ariothier uriderlyirig disease, arid may be 
accomparied by paricreatitis, mernirigitis, etc. Irfectious
causes iriclude tick-borie disease arid chiroriic bacterial
 irifectior1, e.g. prostatitis. Radiographis appear riormal
(withi soft tissue swellirig) arid thie coriditiori is diagriosed
via arthiroceritesis.
Arthrocentesisprocedure
Arthiroceritesis shiould be perfomed or1 46 joirits if poly-
arthiritis is suspected (see illustratioris, below).
Use a 23g rieedle for cats, arid for tighit joirits iri dogs
(15-25 mm); use 21g for larger joirits iri dogs (25-40 mm),

TREATMENT
4.4.7  Managing the chronic orthopaedic patient
■
 Thie majority of chiroric orthiopaedic cases irivolve degerierative
joirit disease (DJD) leadirig to OA
A wide variety of thierapies exists, so a co-ordiriated treatmerit
plar1 must be developed. Suchi plaris are complicated by th1e
lack of clear eviderice of medical efficacy. Thie optioris iriclude:
NSAIDs (4.2.4). It is importarit to realize thiat thie disease
 process coritires regardless of its expressiori as clirical
sigris, thierefore chiroric lower-dose thierapy may be more
effective.
 Other pain relief iricludes opioids, gabaperitir, berizo-
diazepiries, methiocarbamol, amaritadine arid amitriptylire
(4.2.6).

Debride wourid arid take swabs after debridemerit.
Temporary stabilization is achieved differeritly for distal ard
proximal fractures:
Distal limb fracture (below elbow/stifle) requires support
dressirig (a splirit or Robert Jories baridages) thiat mirimizes
furthier tissue damage arid provides pairi relief. Exterid thie 
dressirig above the elbow/stifle.
 Proximal limb, pelvic or spirial fracture requires strict cage
rest. Dressirig is usually couriterproductive.
■Assessment UGA:
■ Radiographi thie fracture site.
All limbs shiould be assessed, iricluding joinits to evaluate
iristability, crepitus or luxatiorl.

 Avoid aggressive fluid thierapy if possible; colloids are
preferred to crystalloids.
 If raised iritracrariial pressure is suspected, marritol
0.25-1 g/kg car1 be giver1 as a bolus over 20 miriutes.
Glucocorticoids are of rio prover1 beriefit.
Heart rate and rhythm: iriterpretatiorl arid resporise.
Tachrycardia: usually extracardiac, e.g. blood loss.
Bradycardia: pressor, e.g. dobutamirie S-10 μg/kg/miri CRI.
Arrhiythimia: orily iriterverie if othier parameters suggest it is
hiavirg a sigrificarit effect ori cardiac output - most
arrhiythimia are better uritreated.
Resporise to poor perfusiorl:
