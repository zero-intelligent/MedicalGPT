CHAPTER 1
Table 1.1 Erythrocyte morphology
Acanthocytes have projections of variable length that are unevenly spaced on the surface of
the red cell. Acanthocytes may be seen as an incidental finding, as a consequence of a high-fat
diet, with disorders of lipid metabolism, and with hemangiosarcoma. In the latter case,
acanthocytes may form when red cells stagnate in cavernous spaces within the tumor, resulting
 in shifts in lipids in the RBC membrane.

Agglutination is identified when red cells clump or cluster together in groups (not in rows) like
a bunch of grapes. Agglutination must be differentiated from rouleaux. Polychromatophils do
 not participate in rouleaux formation but may agglutinate.
Anisocytosis indicates variable red cell size.
 Blister cells appear as though they have a hole(s) punched through the periphery of the red cell.
They are observed most often in feline blood films. Blister cells may result from oxidative injury.
Codocytes (target cells) have a dark central area of hemoglobin, surrounded by a pale zone
that in turn is surrounded by a peripheral rim of hemoglobin. Up to 50% of canine red cells may
be codocytes; they are rarely observed in other species. Increased numbers of codocytes may be
 present with hepatic disease.
Dacryocytes are red cells shaped like tear drops. They are considered artifactuali all points are
 oriented in the same direction. This artifact may be due to poor blood film preparation or
lipemia. Increased numbers of non-artifatual dacryocytes may be seen with myelofibrosis.
Eccentrocytes have eccentric hemoglobin distribution due to annealing of a crescent of red cell
 membrane that excludes hemoglobin. The hemoglobinated portion of the eccentrocyte stains
darkly due to a higher concentration of hemoglobin in that portion of the cell They indicate
 oxidative damage to the RBC membrane and may be accompanied by RBCs with Heinz bodies.
 Echinocytes are thought to be formed either as a result of erythrocyte dehydration or by
 expansion of the outer leaflet of the red cell membrane.
Echinocytes I are red cels with an angular shape or short, blunt projections. They are often due
to artifact, such as occurs with sample aging prior to smear preparation or excessive EDTA
exposure.
 Echinocytes Ill are spherical red cells with sharp projetions of equal length that are evenly
spaced on the surface of the red cell They may be increased in animals with renal disease
and/or electrolyte disturbances. They can also occur artifactually for similar reasons described
for echinocytes I.
 Echinoelliptocytes are oval to cigar-shaped red cells with projections of equal length that are
evenly spaced on the surface of the red cel They may be seen in cats with hepatobiliary disease
 and are rare in other species.
Elliptocytes are oval to cigar-shaped cells. Red cells from Camelidae are normally elitical.

Ghost cells are red cells that have been leached of hemoglobin. They are evidence of intravascular
hemolysis.

be seen with iron deficiency and disorders of iron utilization.
Keratocytes are rescent-shaped cells. They are formed from mechanical shearing {usually due to fibrin
strand deposition) of the red cell. Keratocytes are often accompanied by schizocytes (fragments).
Leptocytes are thin, macrocytic red cells with a membrane surface area that exceeds hemoglobin content.
 The membrane tends to wrinkle or fold, forming twisted (like figure 8) cells. They are sometimes seen with
hepatic disease.
Macrocytes (left) are larger than normal red cells.
Microcytes (right) are smaller than normal red cells.
Polychromasia refers to red cells that appear blue-gray with Romanowsky dyes. They correspond to
reticulocytes on blood films stained with supravital dyes (e. g., new methylene blue, NMB).

Spherocytes (left) are small, dark, round RBCs that are formed by the removal of altered red cell
membrane without concurrent loss of hemoglobin. Spherocytes have no central pallor. They may be seen 
with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.

which may actually be an in vitro artifact.
 Basophilic stippling refers to diffuse blue speckling (with Romanowsky stains) within red cells. This
basophilia is due to the presence of cytoplasmic RNA and reflects red cell immaturity. Increased numbers
of red ces with basophilic stippling often accompany other features of red cell regeneration (especially in

metarubricytes in the peripheral blood when there is no anemia or only mild anemia.
Heinz bodies are difficult to visualize with Romanowsky stains where they may be visible as eccentrically
located refractile bodies or blebs on the periphery of the red cell. They are better visualized and quantified
on blood films stained with NMB, where they stain greenish blue. They indicate oxidative damage to red
cells and may be seen along with eccentrocytes. Small Heinz bodies may be seen in high numbers on blood
films from normal, non-anemic cats.
Nuclear remnants are small round, dark purple, erythrocyte inclusions representing a portion of the
otherwise extruded nucleus. They are usually single and located close to the periphery of the red cell.
Excessive numbers may be seen post-splenectomy or with hypofunctioning of the spleen.
WBCs is significant and may indicate bone marrow damage or hypoxia. NRBCs may accompany a
regenerative response when anemia is present, but should not be used as the only criterion of RBC
regeneration. The total leukocyte count should be corrected if there are ≥5NRBCs/100 wBCs.

The direct smear is moderately cellular and consists predominantly of nondegenerate
neutrophils with fewer macrophages and occasional lymphocytes. The background has a
pale pink, finely stippled appearance. In the cytocentrifuge preparation, nondegenerate
neutrophils predominate. Occasional hypersegmented forms (indicating prolonged
residence in a fluid) are noted. The remaining cells in the preparation include free
erythrocytes, macrophages, small lymphocytes, and mesothelial cells. An etiologic agent
