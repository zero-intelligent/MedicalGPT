Preface
The primary aim of this Manual is to cover the medicine and surgery of psittacine birds for
this subject in greater depth. There have been many advances in psittacine medicine since
the last edition was published in 1996 and these are reflected in the differences between the
two books.
It is impossible to identify and treat the sick bird properly without understanding the healthy
parrot in the wild and in captivity. The first three chapters endeavour to provide the reader
with this information. In the case of nutrition, behaviour and reproduction the normal
Many psittacine patients are presented in a very sick or critical state; in the second part of
by individual organ system. These are designed to be read in their entirety or to be referred
to as needed.
For general practitioners the most commonly seen psittacine patients are the smaller
patients. The small size and low economic value of these patients often make them the most
difficult to examine and treat. We have, therefore, included a chapter devoted to the sick
smal psittacid, which concentrates on the common presentations and syndromes and
as discussion of zoonotic disease and how this relates to the veterinarian.

unplanned event. An appendix of diagnostic algorithms is provided for various common
a drug formulary, a list of common and taxonomic names, and a pictorial guide to droppings.
Both editors developed their interests in avian medicine from general practice and we hope
that this is reflected in a practical, easy-to-use and relevant guide to psittacine medicine.
The editors would like to thank the chapter authors not only for their excellent contributions
but also for adhering to the publishing deadines and making the editors' job as easy as
possible. We would also like to thank Marion Jowett and her team at BSAVA for their
encouragement throughout this project.
Lastly, but by no means least, we would like to thank our wives and families for their support
and tolerance of the time spent editing this book.

Intestines
The duodenum is a U-shaped loop of bowel. The jeju-
num and the ileum are arranged in a series of U-shaped
loops, orcoils. At the junction between the ileum and the
jejunum is the vitelline diverticulum (the remnant of the
yolk sac and the yolk duct) (Figure 7.7). The intestinal
wall has three types of epithelial cells: chief cells,which

Problems for indoor birds
Birds keptindoors are prone to problems shared by their
 aviary-housed relatives, including dietary or toxic condi-
 perhaps even more so. They also experience a range of
 conditions unique to their domestic environment.
Paramount is the lack of sunlight and fresh air,
coupled with a warm dry indoor atmosphere (especially
in winter, when heating is on), predisposing to poor
feather quality, resulting in dull colours, brittleness and 
irritation and culminating in feather plucking (Chapter
16). This will be exacerbated by poor diet and boredom.
Practitioners see far more feather conditions in indoor
birdsthanin those keptoutside, and while this may partly
be explained by the former being solitary hand-reared
birds with emotional hang-ups', the indoorenvironment
 and atmosphere have a considerable effect.
The companionship of humans or other birds - or
rather its lack or inappropriate nature - will lead to
stress-related illness. Parrots are kept often in mini-
 mal space (Figure 3.8) and not allowed out for fear
Food and water containers are generally supplied

The current most common method of identifying birds is
with a leg ring (leg band). Rings are worn between the

Rings may be closed or open. Closed rings consist of a

Chapter 4  Handling
Capture
The initial stage in handling a psittacine bird usually
involves removal from the cage or box used for trans-
portation. Thisis the stage at which there is the greatest
risk of escape and it is essential to ensure that all
windows and doors to the room are closed and that
disturbancefrom outside theroomisunlikely.
Whenever possible, it is a distinct advantage to
encourage clients to present a bird at the surgery within
its own uncleaned cage. This provides a secure con-
tainer from which to capture the patient and also gives
the clinician an opportunity to assess the bird from a

distance, gain an impression of its standard of hus-
bandry and an indication of clinical signs, including
posture, respiration and the nature of its droppings
(Chapter 5). Although patients requiring hospitalization
will benefit from being managed in a specialized avian
unit, the bird's own cage willprovide familiar accommo-
dation in which it could be kept for short-term hospitali-
 zation for observation or administration of medication.
Most cages have a door through which the bird can
be captured with minimal risk of escape. Removal of

 obese birds and dyspnoeic birds.
 Once captured and restrained, most psittacine birds
 can be handled for examination or for the performance
ofa procedure. Many procedures require the help of an
 assistant in the restraint of the patient and it is essential
for the safety of the bird and the operators that any
person assisting is well aware of the techniques of
handling psittacine species and especially the dangers
of handling larger parrots. Owners very rarely make
safe confident assistants and, with the real risks of
injury and the threat of subsequent litigation, such
practice should be strongly discouraged, other than in
exceptional circumstances.
An adequately sized towel, with a generous thick-
ness, allows the bird to be held safely behind the neck,
so controlling the head and beak and, at the same time,
covering the head to restrict vision and enclosing the
wings, body and legs to control struggling (Figure 4.1).

Weight
All avian patients should be weighed each time they
are examined. Hospitalized birds should be weighed
daily, first thing in the morning. Trained birds will stand 
on a perch attached to the scales; others will have to be
placed in a weighing box (Figure 5.5).

The choanal papillae can be seen projecting caudo-
medially from the edge of the slit. Blunting of these
papillae should be noted; it can (among other condi-
 tions) be associated with hypovitaminosis A (Chapter
12). Any discharge from the choanal slit is abnormal
 and is usually associated with a rhinitis or sinusitis.
Samples for cytology and microbiology can be taken
 from the rostral part of the slit to help to establish the

to understand the issues surrounding these and the

clipping or chewing. It restores the full length of feather
and this may remove the stimulus to chew, stimulate
moulting of these feathers, and restore flight. The latter
 may provide further mental stimulation for the bird,
which may be another aid in stopping chewing.
The best source of new feathers is from the same
bird, and owners should always be advised to keep
moulted remiges, as they may come in useful later.
Failing this, feathers from the same species should be
used. However, there is a disease risk in imping feath-

birds' legs (Chapter 3). Damage to these rings by the
bird's beak or other external causes, swelling or crust-

tion (500 rpm for 5 minutes) of the fluid or smear made
with cytocentrifuge equipment will usually provide
adequate cytological specimens.
Fixation and staining
Once a sample has been collected and a smear has
been made, the specimen must be properly fixed to the
slide. If smears are to be sent to a diagnostic labora-
tory, they must be air dried, properly packed (broken
slides are fairly common) and accompanied by a dis-
tinct identification and case history.
The method of fixation depends upon which stain-
ing procedure is to be used. Fresh air-dried blood
 smears and cytology slides are adequate for Roman-
owsky stains, e.g. Giemsa stain and many quick stains.
At least two slides should always be made and at
least one of themleft unstained incase special staining
is needed.
Cytologists use a variety of stains and staining
methods, including acid-fast (Mycobacterium spp.),
Giemsa (cells), Gram (microorganisms), modified
Giminez(Chlamydophilaspp.), Stamp(Chlamydophila
spp.) and Sudan Ili (fat globules) (Campbell, 1995).

The cytological descriptions in this chapter are
based primarily on slides stained with a modified quick
Wright's stain (Hemacolor, Merck). The great advan-
tage of the rapid stains is the short staining time
(usually 20 seconds), which allows rapid examination
of the specimen and provides satisfactory staining
quality. These stains are suitable for use in practice
where a simple staining procedure is desirable. Many
rapid stains aiso provide permanent reference smears
for comparison with other cytological specimens.

 PCR in a bird with clinical signs confirms that the
symptoms are caused by the circovirus infection. If an
 adult bird without clinical symptoms tests positive on
PCR, it is possible that this is due to a transient
infection. lt is advisable to retest these birds after
90 days. If the PCR is negative after 90 days, the bird
has removed the virus. If the PCR is still positive affer
90 days, the bird should be considered permanently
infected with the virus. PBFD, the chronic form of
the circovirus infection, can also be diagnosed by
biopsy of follicles from dysplastic feathers: basophilic
inclusion bodies indicate the PBFD virus. The virus
 can be seen with an electron microscope but cannot
be cultured.
In juvenile Grey Parrots (and other African par-
rots) with acute signs of a circovirus infection, imme-
diate diagnostic testing may be necessary. It is a very
common finding in baby Greys purchased from pet
shops. Within minutes, CBC can give an indication of
circovirus infection. Severe anaemia and a white
blood cell count of 0 or 1 x 10%/l strongly suggest an 
acute circovirus infection in these juveniles with acute
lethargy. In cases where the bird has no heterophils
 and is also anaemic, a negative PBFD PCR test on
blood should be investigated further. In many of those
cases the PCR on bone marrow will be positive. At

circovirus infection should be suspected.
Polyomavirus infection
Polyomavirus infection can be detected with a PCR.
Viraemia can be detected in blood samples and the
virus can also be found in cloacal swabs. After the
virus is no longer present in the blood, it can still be

The most common problem associated with intuba-

is airway occlusion, Small endotracheal tube diam-
eters and cold dry gases increase the probability of a
complete or partial airway obstruction by mucus. This
is not prevented by atropine premedication. As the
airway becomes occluded, the expiratory phase of
ventilation becomes prolonged (Ludders and Matthews,
1996). The cbstruction can be corrected by extubating
the patient and cleaning the endotracheal tube. The
use of IPPV generally reduces the likelihood of endo-
tracheal tube occlusion due to the constant forced
movement of air into and out of the patient.

The proventriculus is seen most clearly on the
lateral view (Figure 9.5). It can be distended normally
 with a number of conditions. Barium will often help to
differentiate these conditions (Figure 9.6). Most patho-
logical distensions slow or stop the passage of food
through the gut. Increased time for the passage of
ingesta is only an indication that the bird is ill and is not
necessarily diagnostic of any particular disease.

Endoscopes fall into two categories: flexible and rigid. It is
unusual to use a flexible endoscope to examine a parrot.
A rigid endoscope is a telescope with an outer
casing of stainless steel tube. Internally the majority of
rigid endoscopes have a rod-lens system: there are
lenses at each end with a series of glass rods that help
 to transmit the image. The lens system is such that it

fundibulum on the medial aspect from the ovary should 
be clamped off with two haemoclips (Figure 10.5), prior
to transection. The dorsal suspensory ligament of the
uterus should be identified extending from the dorsal
abdominal wall to the uterus. In this ligament are a
number of blood vessels, which should be coagulated
or clipped. The uterus and oviduct are then exterior-
ized. Moving dorsocaudally towards the dorsal ab-
 dominal wall, care should be taken in resecting the
dorsal suspensory ligament. If resection is continued
too far, there is a danger of resecting one or more
ureters. Placing a cotton bud into the cloaca will assist
in delineating where the uterus should be clamped

ectomy may be indicated at a later date but would be
inappropriate at this time. The oviduct is closed with
single interrupted or continuous pattern sutures using
1.5 metric (4/0) or finer absorbable material.
Uterine torsion
Egg binding (Chapter 18) may arise subject to a range
of aetiologies. lf the condition does not respond to
medical support, and in particular if there is a markedly
 swollen coelom, torsion of the oviduct should be con-
sidered as a cause (Harcourt-Brown, 1996a). In such
cases the oviduct will have suffered a torsion, through
which no eggs can pass. A number of eggs in varying

Many such patients are in poor condition and represent
poor surgical cases. Once the bird has been stabilized
as much as possible, a ventral midline surgical ap-
 proach is used to access the oviduct. On occasions the
torsion may be reduced (often surgical drainage of the
oviduct is required first) and the breach of the suspen-
sory ligament repaired. Alternatively, a salpingohyste-
rectomy may be performed.

elevated and a haemoclip is placed under the testis
(Figure 10.7). The testis is then surgically cut away
from the clip, after which a further clip is applied from
the caudal direction, between the testis and the

possibility of regeneration. Access to the right testis will
be more difficult, requiring blunt dissection through the
air sac wall, or via a fresh incision on the contralateral
 abdominal wall. A simiiar removal process may then be
 performed on this testis.
Neutering
As described above, ovariectomy is a very risky proce-
dure and orchidectomy is marginally less so. The
indications for neutering may be to prevent breeding

Proventriculotomy
Proventriculotomy for access to the proventriculus or
ventriculus is most commonly indicated for the removal
 of foreign objects that are not retrievable through the
mouth or from the crop using rigid or flexible endoscopes.
Proventricular biopsy is no longer recommended as the
diagnosticmethodof choice where PDD is suspected, in
view of the unacceptable risk (McCluggage, 1992).
Although the technique has been described, ventricu-
lotomy is generally avoided in view of the highly muscu-
lar walls (the physiological muscular activity readily
pulling sutures out of the muscle wall), the inability to
form an inversion closure and the increased vascularity
 compared with the proventriculus. Ventricular foreign

Yolk sacculectomy
In neonate chicks, the presence of an infected or
unretracted yolk sac necessitates surgical removal.
 Chicks that eat early after hatching and those affected
by reduced gut motility are believed to have a higher
incidence of unretracted yolk sac but it is also a
 common abnormality in artificallyincubated birds, where
it may be accompanied by other abnormalities. Yolk
sac infections are often associated with umbilical infec-
tions, enteritis or septicaemia. Clinical signs include
anorexia, lethargy, constipation, diarrhoea, weightloss
and abdominal distension. Non-invasive diagnosis is
readily achieved by ultrasonography. Signs are typi-
cally not detected early enough for medical therapy
alone to be effective.
 Following induction of anaesthesia, the bird is placed
in dorsal recumbency. A small incision is delicately
created cranial to the umbilicus. This incision is ex-
 tended around the umbilicus and the umbilical stump is

excised. The yolk sac is exteriorized and the duct

wings from riding up the body and coming off. Attention
 should be paid to the position of the legs, and no attempts
 should be made to strap them in place as well.It will take

 and some anti-rotational stabilization; the latter fracture
is more challenging. An intramedullary pin combined
with external fixation is the best method of stabilizing
 these fractures in all but the smallest parrots.
Repair of a mid-shaft fracture of the tibiotarsus
A number of techniques have been described for fixing
 this fracture. The quickest, easiest and most reliable is
an intramedullary pin (i/m pin) tied into an external
fixation frame connected to proximal and distal full-pins
(Figure 11.4).

site by plucking the feathers, rather than cutting
them. It is best to tense the skin and pluck out 
feathers in smal numbers going against their
direction of growth.
2. Sterilize the site with chlorhexidine in industrial
methylated spirit (IMS).
3. Use sterile plastic drapes: they are lightweight
and cover the bird with a sterile non-strike-
through layer that is transparent enough to watch
the bird breathing etc.
4. For this technique it is necessary to have access
to both lateral and medial aspects of the leg.
It is possible to place the i/m pin normograde from
the proximal tibiotarsus. This technique is quite difficuit 
to perform and most surgeons find it quicker and easier
to open the fracture site via a craniomedial approach
between the cranial tibial and medial gastrocnemius
muscles (see Figure 2.7b). These muscles are held
together by superficial fascia only. Once through the
skin, the fascia is cut and the gastrocnemius can be

a retrograde manner, exiting through the proximal fe-
mur. The hip joint must be in extension to prevent the
pins from fixing the femur to the antitrochanter (see
Figure 2.7a). The distal threaded half-pin is placed
across the condyles and the proximal pin is placed so
that the tip emerges on the medial side of the femur distal

it is better to use several half-pins, but there is an
increased risk that pins placed in the mid-shaft region

cases seen whilst the bird is still growing can be cured
 by hobbling the legs together with a soft bandage, or
placing the bird in a deep cup-shaped depression that
forces the legs together. Reduced lighting is useful to
 control the bird's activity.

risk that it may lose its blood supply and die.
Itis worth bearing in mind that the majority of parrots
tend to favour using their left foot (much as people are
usually right-handed). Foot amputation is a salvage
technique and a last resort. It should not be undertaken
if other options are available. lnexperienced avian
surgeons should seek guidance before going ahead
with amputation of a whole foot.
Beak
The beak is modified skin supported on the maxillary
 and mandibular bones (see Chapter 2 and Figure 2.3).
Many of the problems affecting the parrot beak and
 their treatment are related to its structure. The beak
can heal by first or second intention and can aiso be
incised and sutured.
Much as hydrophilic dressings (e.g. Granuflex or
Duoderm) are useful as 'bandages'forencouraging skin
growth, Coe-Pak can be used to promote the healing of
the beak. This product is used in humans after oral
trauma surgery to cover pins, wire and open wounds. It 
allows granulation tissue to form and encourages epi-
thelialization. Coe-Pak does not stick to the beak, or to
soft tissue, and so it is easily removed; it sets to the
texture of bubblegum. If Coe-Pak is to be used to cover
 a defect, 0.8 mm Steinmann pins are driven through the
beak and looped round on either side. Usually three are
used and then they can be connected with orthopaedic
wire (23 G). As wounds healing by secondary intention
produce fibrin and clots of pus and blood, the Coe-Pak
should be changed regularly to allow removal of tibrin
 clot and other debris; if it is not removed this mass will
 prevent wound closure. After the beak has healed the
 wires are removed, the holes are coated with fucidin
ointment and healing takes place in a few days.
Traumatic injuries to the beak are common. Most

2. Reach beneath the keratin and elevate the soft
tissue, dermis and finally the bone, bringing it into
alignment with the rest of the maxilla.
3. Lay the dermis back, smoothing out any wrinkles.
4. If possible, replace the horn.
Small defects need coating with some fusidic acid
ointment (do not use one containing steroid) and the
bird should be given a course of antibiotic: 5 days on
marbofloxacin would be ideal.
Large defects should be dealt with in the same
manner but have to be covered with Coe-Pak
postoperatively, to prevent desiccation and further
infection. This requires placement of pins and wires
(Figures 11.19 and 11.20).
 Infected or longstanding injuries need thorough irriga-
tion with normal saline and removal of all infected or dead 
tissue. Antibiotic should be instilled into the interiorof the
 mandible and the bird should receive a long course of 
systemic antibiotic. The wound will need to heal by
second intention. It must be covered with Coe-Pak,
which must be changed every 7-14 days so that the
wound canbe cleaned and thefibrinplug removed.
Occasionally the whole maxilla is bitten off.Although
 euthanasia may be the option of choice, it is possible to
save a bird even though it will never regrow its beak. The
 stump should be cleaned, painted with antiseptic and
covered with Coe-Pak to encourage it to heal. Although
the beak does not regenerate, it will heal and become a 
fibrous pad that willallow the bird to cope. Some manage
to eat seed; others need a pelleted diet.

Cleft beak and palate: This is an uncommon congeni-
tal deformity. The beak is separated on the lateral
aspect. Repair is best done early. lIt is possible to split
the unfused edges of the beak and then join them
together with everting sutures. Care should be taken to
repair the part of the defect near the nostril, as this
seems to be the most difficult to make normal. The
defect also allows the mandible to spread and so a
temporary horizontal mattress suture is applied to pull
 the walls of the mandible into a more normal position.
Acquired deformity
The commonest acquired deformity of the beak is seen
in macaws and it starts during rearing. It is likely that a
bruise to the base of the beak slows its growth: the beak
bends towards the injured side. It is possible to prevent
this by feeding on alternate sides. Once the deviation
has started, it can be corrected in the early stages by
tween feeds so that the maxilla is pulled back across
the mandible. In spite of this, it is common for macaws 
to be presented with a twisted beak when they have
fledged, i.e. they are skeletally mature (Figure 11.21).

Practical feeding
Commercially available parrot diets can be divided into
two broad groups: traditional seed-based mixes and
 modern formulated diets. The appearance of the com-
mon diets used in aviculture is shown in Figures 12.4
to 12.7. Both diet groups are frequently supplemented
with a combination of soaked pulse mixtures, vegeta-
 bles and fruit. In addition commercial vitamin and
mineral supplements are often added. Figure 12.8

chicks have a high calcium requirement for rapid skel-

ment for eggshell production.
 As in mammals, calcium metabolism is tightly regu-
lated by the acticn of parathyroid hormone, vitamin D
and calcitonin, but the system is much more responsive
in birds. For example, a chicken injected with pure
parathyroidhormone will become hypercalcaemic within
8 minutes of injection, whereas in mammals this can
take up to 24 hours. Many diets fed to parrots in captivity
are deficient in both calcium and vitamin D, thereby

plays a particularly important role in the absorption of

Many birds fed a diet deficient in vitamin D and calcium
suffer disorders of calcium metabolism, with symptoms

Viral diseases
Pacheco's disease
Aetiology and pathogenesis
Pacheco's disease is caused by a psittacine-specific
β-herpesvirus with different strains showing differences
 in their pathogenicity. It is not transmissible to other
 avian species. It belongs to the same group of herpes-
viruses that cause inclusion body hepatitis in other avian
species, but does not share common antigens. It is
excreted mainly in faeces but also in other body fluids.
A vertical transmission of the virus is also suggested.
Infection may be airborne or oral. The incubation period
is short, being approximately 7 days.The virus primarily
infects lymphatic tissue, epithelial cells (skin,

salmonellosis are infected with S. Typhimurium. Sal-

C. perfringens causes a double area of haemolysis,
but it can be more easily detected on specific agars. In 
cases of enterotoxaemia, the detection of toxin from 
 the serum is possible but expensive.
Therapy
First, the detection of the source of the disease must be
located and eliminated. Food change might be neces-
 sary and dry food with low protein content is recom-
mended. In addition, an antibiotic treatment with
 amoxicillin or tetracycline is important. Probiotics are
useful to balance the intestinal flora. In cases with
(a)
 enterotoxaemia, treatment is often too late. In other
 cases it depends on the status of the damaged intestine.
It takes at least 3-5 days to restore intestinal function.
 During this time fluid therapy and the control of electro-
lytes are important. Inchronic cases a full recovery of the
bird might not be possible. The application of antitoxin is
 possible in acute cases, but with questionable results as 
different toxins of C. perfringens exist.

Blood results are non-specific but a massive leuco-
 cytosis with increased numbers of heterophils, basophils
and monocytes might occur. Levels of liver enzymes
and bile acids are often increased but this is not a
regular finding.
 Conjunctivitis in psittacine birds, especially if newiy
purchased, always requires a conjunctival swab for
further diagnosis. It is comrmon for grass parakeets,
Budgerigars and Cockatiels to develop a primary
chlamydophilial conjunctivitis with no other signs. To
confirm the diagnosis it is necessary to detect the
pathogen or, more easily, its DNA. A quick first result in
a PME can be obtained by a spleen or air sac smear
(a)
stained according to Stamp (Chapter 7). Dealing with 
such samples must be performed carefully as the
material is of zoonotic importance. Gloves, face mask
and laboratory coat are important.
Chiamydophila dies quickly on transport and so a
special transport medium must be used. Cell culture is
necessary, as the organisms do not grow on cell-free
media. False negatives are common. The safest method
for detection of Chlamydophila is to find its DNA using
a PCR. Conjunctival or cloacal swabs as well as tissue
samples may be used.

antibodies, it does not mean that the bird is still a
carrier. The presence of the pathogen in such birds
needs to be confirmed by another method. If the
antibody titre is high and the bird has clinical signs, it
might be of diagnostic value but in such cases the
pathogen can usually be demonstrated. The demon-

Infectious agents
ELISA tests for Aspergillusspp. antibodies are prone to
false negative results (Reidarson and McBain, 1995;
Redig et al., 1997). A solid-phase immunoassay has
been created for the detection of antibodies to the
Chiamydophila sp. organism (lmmunocomb Biogel)
in psittacine blood. Interpretation may be complicated
when low levels of antibodies are detected, as this may
indicate previous exposure to the organism, or a cur-
rent carrier state. In addition, antigen tests may be
used on respiratory secretions or faeces, although
false negative results may occur due to intermittent
sheddingof the organism, This is the same for the more
sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PcR) tests for

Endoscopy
Endoscopy is a vital component in the diagnosis of
respiratory disease in psittacine birds. It is essential for
physical examination of lesions detected using radio-
graphic techniques, and for collecting samples for mi-
crobialculture and sensitivity testing. In addition, physical
debulking of lesions such as granulomas/aspergillomas
as part of a therapeutic regime is possible. Access is
usually gained via the caudal thoracic air sac, but more
caudal lesions may be approached via the abdominal air 
sac caudal to the pelvic limb (Chapter 9).

can lead to intestinal impaction. Birds typically present
with weight loss or emaciation. Diagnosis is via a faecal
smear or flotation. The prepatent period is 3-4 weeks.
In severe infections, birds may die during the occult
phase. As well as anthelmintic treatment being initi-
ated, the environment should be cleaned to avoid
reinfection. This may involve removaland replacement
of the top layer of soil in dirt-floored aviaries (e.g.
concreting the aviary), or changing husbandry such
that the birds no longer have access to their droppings
(e.g. suspended aviary).
Bacterial infection

Chapter 18  Reproduction and paediatrics
Dystocia is the mechanical obstruction of an egg
in the caudal reproductive tract. It can occur at 
the level of the caudal oviduct/uterus, the vagina,
or the vaginal-cloacal junction. Obstruction can
result in cloacal impaction and/or prolapse.
Causes of egg binding include: hypocalcaemia and
other nutritional deficiencies; dysfunction of oviduct,
uterus or vaginal muscle; excessive egg production;
large, misshapen or soft-shelled egg(s); age of hen;
 obesity; oviduct tumour; oviduct infection; lack of exer-
cise; hyper- or hypothermia; breeding out of season;

possibly a hysterectomy are indicated if: the egg is
severely adherent to the oviduct wall; the uterus is
ruptured; a soft-shelled egg is located cranial to the
oviduct; or the egg is ectopic.

Plasma enzyme values can be invalidated by the

Parathormone (PTH) is secreted in response to a
decrease in plasma calcium concentration. The pri-
 mary target tissues are kidney and bone, PTH being of
particular importance during egg laying where calcium
is moved from medullary bone to the eggshell.
Renal production of vitamin D, which is also regu-
lated by PTH, can raise blood calcium and inorganic
phosphate levels by increasing intestinal absorption. It
 is also thought to increase renal absorption of calcium
and to increase loss of phosphate (Chapter 12). Oes-
trogens and prolactin stimulate the renal production of
vitamin D; and so there is a marked increase in blood
 calcium levels about 4 days before ovulation (partly
due to yolk protein-bound calcium).

Lymphosarcoma
Although birds have aggregates of lymphoid cells
around blood vessels and in various locations in the
body, they do not have encapsulated lymph nodes and
so lymphadenopathy is not a feature of neoplastic
disease. Lymphoid leukaemia originates in the bone
marrow. Lymphosarcoma usually originates in the pri-
mary or secondary lymphoid tissue and can spread to
other parts of the body. Multicentric lymphosarcoma
does occur, and is the most common lymphoid neo-
plasm, There may be diffuse or nodular involvement
and the liver is the most commonly affected organ,
folowed by the spleen and kidneys. Other organs that
are typically infiltrated include the skin, bone marrow,
Gl tract, thyroid gland, oviduct, lungs, sinuses, brain,
 periorbital muscles, pancreas, testes and thymus. There

skin and these may ulcerate.
No viral cause in psitttacine birds has yet been
 found (unlike in poultry). Typical histology is of uniform
populations of lymphoblasts and mature lymphocytes.
Mitotic figures are common.
Diagnosis is usually from biopsied material, since
many birds with lymphosarcoma are not leukaemic and
therefore haematology is not useful in these cases. The
organs involved are generally enlarged and pale and
must be differentiated from amyloid, fatty liver, hepatitis,
mycobacteria infection and other neoplastic cases.
Definitive diagnosis
A definitive diagnosis is only reached by performing a
biopsy and histopathology. The presence of a neo-

Scoring body condition
 Palpation of the sternum gives a reasonable guide to
current nutritional or metabolic status. In a normal bird
the sternal keel should be just palpable, with the
convex-shaped pectoral muscles almost level with it on
either side, though this will vary with the amount of
fliying the bird is allowed. Shape of the muscle mass
 can give an idea of chronicity of the disease. Initial loss
of muscle mass occurs relatively rapidly. possibly due
to depletion of glycogen stores rather than true catabo-
lism, and the convex shape can turn to a marked
concave within a few days. Further muscle loss occurs
gradually until, with debilitating diseases of weeks to
months in duration, the pectoral muscle mass be-
comes almost completely lost and the shape of the
underlying bone can be determined easily.
Obese birds may have a layer of subcutaneous fat
 on palpation of the sternal area, and it is important to
 recognize that with subacute diseases it is quite possi-
ble for a bird to show marked loss of pectoral muscle
 mass and yet still be obese. A further complication of

Nevertheless, the examination within the cage should

quadrant and should not be misinterpreted as an egg
or a neoplasm, though hepatomegaly or space-occu-
pying masses may displace the gizzard into a more
obvious position than usual (Figure 21.7). Otherwise
the area should generally have an'empty' feel.
(b)
A'full' or 'spongy' feel may be an indicator of obesity
but could indicate increased soft tissue structures
within the abdomen, such as a dilated female repro-
ductive tract (normal during egg laying) or gastrointes-
tinal tract. Eggs and neoplasms are also sometimes
palpated, and Cockatiels in particular seem prone to
egg-related peritonitis, possibly as a consequence of
oviducttorsion. Fluid within the peritoneal cavity causes

wet-preparation examination (for motile protozoans,
nematodes, cestodes, inflammatory cells). Later the

 either rapid cytological stains (e.g. Diff-Quik, Rapi-Diff)

populations, or with Gram staining, which allows more

List of bird names
vary with the language of the country and then, often, within the language. There have been many attempts to
produce 'standard' lists of common names in English, in both the UK and USA. The Handbook of Birds of the World
(Del Hoyo et al., 1997) has an excellent set of names in English, Spanish, German and French; these names are
given for every species of psittacid (as weli as other birds).
The English names used in this Manual are those used most commonly by bird keepers and breeders.
The Latin names and taxonomy used in this Manual are taken from The Howard and Moore Complete
Checklist of Birds of the World (Dickinson, 2003).
