 Diagnostic Techniques
Table 1. Modified double centrifugation technique
1.
Mix 1 g of feces in 10-12 ml water in a beaker and stir until feces are in suspension.
2.
Pour the mixture through a tea strainer into another beaker. Press the material in the strainer with a spatula
and discard the material in the strainer.
3.
Pour the contents into a 15-ml centrifuge tube and fill to the top with water.
4.
Centrifuge the tubes at 1,s00 rpm for 5-10 minutes.
5.
 Decant the tube and then fll one half full of flotation solution. Stir the sediment with a wooden applicator
stick and then fill the tube almost to the top with flotation solution.
6.
 Place the tube in the centrifuge and with a dropper add fotation solution to the tube so the solution is about
level with the top of the tube. Place a 22-mm2 coverslip on top of the tube and in contact with the sugar so-
lution.
7.
 Centrifuge at 1,s00 rpm for 5-10 minutes. The coverslip will not fall offif the centrifuge has free-swinging
 trunions that swing out to the horizontal position.
8.
Remove coverslip by lifting straight upward, and place on a glass slide. All parasite stages that floated should
 be in the drop under the coverslip.
9.
Examine the slide under x100 (x10 ocular and x10 objective) or higher magnification and observe all para-
site stages present.
fall off. Fecal flotations can also be done without centrifugation by allowing samples in step 4 to set for 20 minutes and in
step 7 to set for 30 minutes. This method is not as effective as centrifugation, but results are usually reliable.

6.
 Remove the debris on top of the tube with a cotton-tipped swab. Decant the rest of the fluid.
7.
Collect the sediment with a pipette, place it on a microscope slide, and examine it microscopically for para
site eggs.
Note: This technique is good for detection of trematode eggs.
Table 4. Fecal sedimentation technique for Fasciola bepatica and some other fluke eggs
1.
Mix 5 g feces in 200 ml water in a beaker.
2.
Pour the mixture through a tea strainer and discard the material in the strainer.
3.
After 10 minutes, decant approximately 70% of the supernatant and refill the beaker with fresh water.
4.
 Repeat step 3 for three to five times until the supernatant is clear.
5.
Pour off 90% of the supernatant and pour the sediment into a Petri dish.
6.
Examine the sediment under a dissecting microscope (×20-x30) or sca nning objective (x4) of the microscope
(total magnifications = x40) for large, yellow, operculated eggs of Fasciola bepatica.
Note: A commercial device consisting of two sieves is sold under the trade name Flukefinder and is
available from Visual Differences, 106 North Bear Bluff Road, Preston, ID 83263 (twww.flukes@mac.com).
Table 5. Baermann technique for lungworm larvae isolation
1.
Place warm water (approximately 2s?C) into a glass funnel that has a stopcock or clamp on a rubber hose
on the end of the funnel.
2.
Take 5 g (or more) feces, wrap the feces in two layers of gauze and place the feces in the water in the funnel.
3.
After 8 hours, withdraw the bottom 10-15 ml of fluid from the funnels into a 15-ml centrifuge tube.
4.
Centrifuge the tube for 5 minutes at 1,s00 rpm.
5.
With a pipette, withdraw the bottom 2-3 drops from the centrifuge tube and transfer to microscope slide.
Add a coverslip and look for larvae under the microscope.
Table 6. Modified McMaster technique for parasite eggs
 This is a dilution method of estimating eggs present in fecal samples.
1.
Mix 3 g feces in 15 ml of water and pour through a tea strainer.
2.
 Pour strained material into a 15-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1,500 rpm for 2 minutes.
3.
Mix the sediment in 10 ml of flotation solution and pour into a beaker; add additional 32 ml of flotation so-
lution.
4.
With a pipette, transfer suspension to a McMaster counting chamber and fll both chambers.
5.
Transfer the slide to a microscope and count all eggs inside the ruled squares.
6.
 Multiply the number of eggs in both chambers by S0 for the total number of eggs per gram of feces.
 Note: This technique is not very accurate for samples with small numbers of eggs. McMaster Slides are available from

Diagnostic Parasitology
Table 7. Direct smear
This technique is used primarily for diagnosis of Giardia. It is a very inefficient technique for diagnosis of other parasite
infections.
1.
Mix a fecal sample the size of the head of a match (l-2 mm?) with a drop of water or saline on a microscope
slide.
2.
 Add a coverslip and examine under the microscope.
4.
 If large particles are present under the coverslip, remove the particles or start with a new sample.
Table 8. Skin scraping for external parasites
This technique is used primarily for the diagnosis of mites.
1.
 Add several drops of mineral oil or glycerin to the area to be scraped. The area should be at the periphery of
the cutaneous lesion, not in the center of the lesion.
2.
With a scalpel blade, scrape the area to a depth that blood begins to ooze from the wound.
3.
Transfer the bloody material that was scraped to a microscope slide.
4.
Add additional mineral oil and cover with a coverslip.
5.
Examine under low power (x40) of the microscope first, and if nothing is seen, increase the magnification.

Table 9. Evaluation of blood for microfilariae
Knott's test:
1.
 Mix 1 ml of blood with 9 ml of 2% formalin in a 15-ml tube. Mix by inverting the tube several times after
covering the top of the tube with your thumb.
2.
3.
 Use a pipette to draw off 1 or 2 drops of sediment from the base of the tube and transfer to a microscope
slide.
4.
Add a coverslip and examine at x400.
A drop of 0.1% methylene blue added to the drop on the microscope slide can be helpful in making the di-
agnosis.
Hematocrit method:
1.
 Fill a microhematocrit tube with blood and centrifuge for 1 minute.
2.
Wait a few minutes and then examine the buffy coat with a dissecting microscope. Look for live microfilari-
ae.
3.
Break the tube at the buffy coat and dab the buffy coat on a microslide. Add coverslip and examine for mi-
crofilariae on low power on the microscope.

 Place 1 drop of fresh blood or heparinized blood on a microslide and cover with a coverslip.
2.
Examine under low power for live microfilariae.
3.
To slow the microfilariae, place a drop of 10% formalin at the edge of the coverslip.

Microscopy
Table 10. Calibration of the microscope
The accurate measurement of microscopic diagnostic stages of parasites requires the calibration of the microscope.
Two scales are necessary: the ocular micrometer in the ocular of the microscope, which is a glass disc bearing an arbitrary
scale of 50 or 100 divisions, and the stage micrometer, which is a commercial slide etched with an absolute scale 1 or 2
mm long, subdivided into units of 0.1 mm and 0.01 mm.
i   o s    o (l s     o s
1 mm = 1,000 μm
0.1 mm = 100 μm
0.01 mm = 10 μm
Most parasite diagnostic stages are between 10 μm and 100 μm long.
The number of magnifications is determined by multiplying the ocular power (usually x10) by the objective power.
Therefore, a x10 ocular with x4 objective is x40.
On the lowest power of the microscope (usually a x4 objective), superimpose the ocular micrometer over the stage mi-
crometer. Line up the left-hand ends of the scales. Find a place on the scales where one line on each scale coincides direct-
ly over the others and count the number of ocular units with a known metric unit on the stage micrometer.
Example: S8 units of the ocular micrometer coincides with 0.36 mm on the stage micrometer.
One space of the ocular micrometer, therefore, equals 0.36 mm divided by 58 units = 0.0062 mm per ocular unit or 6.2

12 ocular units to obtain the length of the egg (74.4 μm).
Using the same technique, calibrate all objectives on the microscope and record the conversion factors on the micro-
scope. Most microscopes with x10 eyepieces will have conversion factors similar to these:
X4 objective = 25.0 μm per unit space
x10 objective = 9.0 μm per unit space
X40 objective = 2.5 μm per unit space
x100 objective = 1.0 μm per unit space
Fig. 5. Example of calibration of the ocular micrometer
Fig. 4. Example of a stage micrometer and an ocular mi-
with the x4 objective and 10 ocular. Note: 45 spaces =
crometer in the eyepiece.
0.76 mm = 760 μm; 1 space = 16.9 μm.

sporocyst is one-half of the oocyst.
Sarcocystis sp.
Common name: None (Apicomplexa), a protozoan parasite.
Size of oocyst: 18 μm × 15 μm. Prepatent period is 8-33 days.
Importa nce: Not very pathogenic in cats, but can be pathogenic in sheep.
 Diagnosis: Fecal flotation—-see sporulated oocysts or sporocysts. Sporulated oocysts passed in cat feces. Sheep are inter-
mediate hosts for S. ovifelis. Pseudocyst (schizont, sarcocyst) in sheep muscles, especially esophagus.
Treatment: None needed.
Prevention: Do not feed cats raw meat.

Neospora caninum
Common name: Neospora canimum.
Size of pseudocyst: Usually <100 μm .
 Importance: This parasite can ca use abortions.
Liveborn calves may be underweight, weak, un-
 able to stand, and may have neuromuscular signs.
Transplacental transmission occurs.
 Diagnosis: Clinical signs and histologically. Pseudocysts 
seen in neural tissue at necropsy.
 Source of infection: Unknown.
Treatment: Treatment is experimental. Some coc-
cidiostats and coccidiocides may be helpful.

Parasites of Wildlife
Parelapbostrongylus tenuis
Common name: Meningeal worm or brain worm ( Meta strongyloidea-Protostrongylidae).
Adult size: 10-15 cm. Prepatent period is 90 ± 9 days.
Size of larvae: 300-400 μm, first-stage larvae in feces, with dorsal spine on kinky tail.
Importance: This is one of the most important parasites of wildlife. Adult P teruis live associated with the meninges on
However, when infective larvae in snails are eaten by hosts such as moose, caribou, elk, mule deer, exotic species of
deer, llamas, and domestic sheep and goats, the infection is often lethal because larvae damage the spinal cord and
brain and cause severe inflammatory reactions to the CNS, resulting in incoordination, paralysis, and death.
 Presence of infected white-tailed deer in an ecosystem may severely limit the survival of other susceptible hosts (see
bibliography).
Diagnosis: At necropsy the adult worms are found on the brain of white-tailed deer or larvae in the the spinal cord or
brain tissue of susceptible hosts. Dorsal-spined larvae can be found in the feces of definitive hosts using the
Baermann funnel.
Note: There are closely related nematodes that also pass dorsal-spined larvae in the feces of wild ruminants (see
Table S5). There are still several unknown species of these worms, and there is considerable variation in the lengths 
of the first-stage larvae. The definitive diagnosis is to find and identify the adult parasites in the host. Some of the
adults are in the muscles (P. odocoilei, P. andersoni, Elaphostrongylus cervi), the lungs ( Varestrongylus alpenae,
Muellerius capillaris), or on the meninges of the brain ( Parelaphostrongylus temuis).
 Treatment: Ivermectin, 0.2 mg/kg SC has been reported to be effective against early developing larval stages of P. termuis,
but is not effective against adult parasites. Prevention: Treatment every three weeks is recommended to prevent in-
fection.

Fascioloides magna
Common name: Deer liver fluke or large American liver fluke (Fasciolidae).
Adult size: 46 cm in the liver parenchyma.
 Size of egg: 150 μm × 70 μm , operculated, yellow. Prepatent period is 7 months.
Importance: This fluke is nonpathogenic in deer and elk. It is a fatal infection in domestic sheep and goats. Infected cat-
tle, bison, and llamas do not pass eggs (dead-end hosts). Reduced productivity is associated with infection in cattle.
Diagnosis: In deer and elk, use sedimentation test. In cattle and sheep, use serological tests.
Treatment in deer: Clorsulon, 7-21 mg/kg PO; less than 80% effective
Albendazole, 15 mg/kg PO; 90% effective
Tricla bendazole, 20 mg/kg PO; more than 95 % effective

Sarcocystis sp.
Common name: Nerve or muscle cysts (Protozoa-Apicomplexa).
Size: Usually microscopic, but some species, especially in ducks, elk, and rabbits, 1 mm or more.
Importance: Usually nonpathogenic, but large numbers may kill the host. Carnivores are the definitive hosts that pass the
 infective oocysts. These do not infect humans.
 Diagnosis: Visual observation; usually by histology.
Treatment: None known; some ionophores such as monensin may ameliorate signs.

been reported in many states (Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California)
 and appears to be spreading. Affected sheep lose their hair and develop crusty lesions in the ears and often over the
entire body. Death occurs in severely affected animals. This condition apparently does not spread to cattle or sheep,
but mites can grow in ears of rabbits and deer.
 Diagnosis: Visual observation of lesions and a skin scraping of the edge of a lesion to isolate mites. Psoroptes sp. mites
have long, jointed pedicels, which confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment: Ivermectin, 1.0-2.0 mg/kg body weight PO or SC × 7 d. A single injection of ivermectin at a high level may
not kill all the mites. Repeated treatments may be necessary.

Treatment: None.
Baylisascaris procyonis
Common name: Raccoon ascarid (Ascaridoidea ).
Adult size: 12-23 cm, in small intestine.
Size of egg: 80 μm x 70 μm.
Importance: This ascarid causes visceral larva migrans
in humans and CNS disorders in a variety of
birds and animals. Humans should use hygienic
measures when working with raccoons and rac-
 coon feces. Eggs are not infective when passed in
feces and require approximately 30 days or more
to become infective.
Diagnosis: Fecal flotation. (Similar to Toxocara canis in
dogs).
Treatment: Fenbendazole, 20 mg/kg PO q 24 h x 5 d

Section 13
Nematodes (roundworms) of marine mammals are
common. The ascarid group primarily consists of
Contracaecum, Anisakis, Phocanema, and Terranvova.
Ascarids are very common. The larval stages of these
 are often seen in fish, and some can infect humans
when the larvae in fish are ingested. Marine mammals
 are usually infected by eating infected fish.
The adult parasites are usually large and live in the
stomach or intestines. Adult worms are 3-10 cm.
Most dewormers listed in Table 58 are effective for
trea tment.
Fig. 268. Typical nematode egg (ascarid).
 Prevention for humans is to cook fish well before
eating. Pyrantel is used to treat humans.
Trematodes (flukes) are also common in marine
mammals. Examples are listed in Tables 56 and 57.
Eggs are usually operculated at one end.
Fig. 269. Typical trematode eggs.
Acanthocephala are spiny-headed worms and are
found commonly in the intestines of marine mammals.
Their spiny heads are firmly imbedded in intestinal mu-
 cosa. Acanthocephalans often appear yellow or orange
at necropsy.
Fig. 270. Typical acanthocephala eggs.
Tapeworms (cestodes) are common in marine
mammals. The broad fish tapeworm (Dipbyllobothrium
 sp.) is especially common in those animals that eat fish.
Pseudophyllidean tapeworms like Diphyllobothrium
spp. are the most common type of tapeworm in marine
 mammals and have operculated eggs. Tapeworms are
often nonpathogenic and can be treated with prazi-
qua ntel.

External Parasites
Pediculus bominis
Common name: Human head lice.
Adult size: 2-3 mm on the head in the hair. Eggs (nits)
are attached to the hairs.
Importance: These are sucking lice and suck blood.
They cause itching of the scalp. These lice are
 host specific in humans.
Diagnosis: Find the eggs, adults, or nymphs on the
head.
Treatment: See Table 63.
 Permethrin shampoos are the standard treatment, but
many lice are resistant.
Fig. 313. Pedicutus bominis (head louse).
Pthirus pubis
Common name: Pubic lice.
Adult size: 1 mm, with large claws, in pubic hair. Eggs
(nits) are attached to pubic hairs.
Importance: These are sucking lice and suck blood.
They cause itching of the pubic area. These lice
are host specific in humans.
Diagnosis: Find the eggs, adults, or nymphs in the pu-
bic area.
Treatment: See Table 63.
 Permethrin shampoos are commonly used.
Fig. 314. Pthirus pubis (pubic louse).
Sarcoptes scabiei
Common name: Scabies mites.
Adult size: 400-600 um. Adults, nymphs, larvae (6
legs), and eggs are in the skin
Importance: Cause severe itching ("Norwegian itch").
Human sca bies mites are relatively host specific in
humans.
Diagnosis: Skin scraping. Find eggs, larvae, nymphs, or
a dults.
Treatment: See Table 63
Ivermectin is often effective.

Common Artifacts in Feces
Microscopic seeds from these microscopic seed
heads often look like parasite eggs. These seeds resem-
ble tiny Trichuris eggs to some degree.
Fig. 328. Microscopic seed head.
Mites and mite eggs are often seen in feces. Some
 of these mites are environmental mites that are ingested
and pass out in feces. Some mites are the result of ani-
 mals licking themselves, and some mites are spurious 
 parasites that are the result of ingesting prey species
that have mites. This mite is Cnemidocoptes, a bird
 mite in dog feces. Apparently, this dog ate an infected

The "horsehair worm" (Gordius) is often found in
livestock waterers, freshwater springs, and in water
from springs, toilets, kitchen sinks, etc. These are not 
parasites of vertebrates. These are long worms, often
6-10 inches long.
