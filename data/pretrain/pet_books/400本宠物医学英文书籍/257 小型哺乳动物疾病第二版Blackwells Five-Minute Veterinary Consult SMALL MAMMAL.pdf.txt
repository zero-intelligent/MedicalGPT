PREFACE
The popularity of rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, chinchillas, and rodents as companion animals
animal practice, emergency clinics, and even canine and feline specialty practice are often faced
with the difficult challenge of evaluating these often unfamiliar species. Although excellent in-
depth textbooks exist, much of the current information available on these species is scattered
in multiple journals, periodicals, conference proceedings, bulltins, veterinary magazines, and
internet resources. For the busy practitioner to keep abreast of all of these resources is a daunting
task, especially for those simultaneously striving to keep current in canine and feline medicine.
Blackwells Five-Minute Veterinary Consult: Small Mammals was designed to bring this information
together in a concise, readily accessible format.
Blackuell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult is a quick reference with a unique format that provides
consistency and breadth of coverage unparalled by other texts. Like other editions in the 5-
Minute Veterinary Consult series, the Small Mammals edition is divided into topics based on
presenting problems and diseases. Each topic has an identical format, which makes it easy to
find information. Detailed, up-to-date information on the diagnosis and treatment options for 
all disorders commonly encountered in these species are readily accessible. Individual topics are
thoroughly covered within a few pages so that there is little need to cross-reference to other topics
within thie text.
To make this information quickly available, the book is divided by species into separate sections for
chinchillasgunea pigs,ferrets,rabits,and rodents, with tab thequicklydentify theetin
requiredWihiahcietnirganzedalhabialhatachaereail
located. A detailed table of contents and index is also provided to help the reader effciently find
the desired topic. The appendix also contains a formulary of commonly used medications.
I am forrunate and pleased to have had the asstance of several outstanding experts in the feld
of small mammal medicine to serve as contributing authors and as a panel of reviewers for topics
presented in this work. Their input has significantly strengthened the text and greatly enhanced the
depth and scope of coverage of each topic. Unlike that of canine and feline medicine, the amount
of information on the disorders of small mammals that has been generated by controlled studies is
limited. Much ofourcumulative knowledge is based on the shared experience of practicing exotic
animal veterinarians. Because of this, many topics in rabbit and ferret medicine are controversial.
I have made every attempt to present information with as little bias as possible, and having topics
reviewed facilitated this. However, the reader is encouraged to utilize thelist of suggested reading
 printed at the end of each topic for additional information and viewpoints.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would like to express my gratitude to the reviewers of the first edition of this text. The expertise
of all of the reviewers has significantly strengthened the text and greatly enhanced the depth
and scope of coverage of each topic. Thanks goes to Dr. Michael Murray, Dr. Evelyn Ivey, Dr.
Tia Greenberg, Dr. Karen Rosenthal, Dr. Matthew Johnston, and Dr. Dave Chapman for their
extensive effort and willingness to work within a limited timeframe.
I would like to acknowledge all exotic animal practioners who have contributed in one way or
another to our cumulative knowledge base. Much of what we know of companion exotic animal
 medicine is based on the shared experience of these veterinarians, without which this text would
not have been possible.
Last, I would like to gratefully acknowledge Drs. Larry P Tilley and Francis W. K. Smith, whose
insight and innovation pioneered the Five-Minute Veterinary Consult series.
