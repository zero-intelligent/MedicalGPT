PREFACE
At the time of writing this book the study of geriatrics as a veterinary discipline is
very much in its infancy. My interest in the subject is obviously becoming more
acute as I work through my own midlife crises and see old age looming on the not-
Mary Harrington, a human geriatrician in London - both of whom took part in a
Symposium on Geriatric Veterinary Medicine which I organised in London in 1988.
In researching for this book I was disappointed at the relative lack of published
areas of progressive renal disease and cognitive disorders. There are inherent
dangers in extrapolating too much from experimental studies and from studies
conducted in different species, nevertheless there are many useful comparative
Much work needs to be done to obtain base information about geriatric veterinary
patients and in the meantime it would be helpful to the develof veterinary geriatric

for documenting their subjects so well. I have tried to make sense out of the
information available and to address some of the main issues in geriatric medicine
these are well documented in other publications.
At times I have been deliberately controversial and I look forward to receiving
correspondence from colleagues with alternative views!
I have absolutely no doubt that this book will need to be totally revised within the
next few years but in the meantime I hope that it will stimulate some of my

owners often do not present an animal when it develops mild signs of disease such
as increased thirst or increased frequency of urination in the belief that such signs
 are an inevitable result of advancing age.
Farm animals and some groups of working dogs are not allowed to survive to old
age and for these animals there is little available information about the effects of
ageing. The oldest recorded age for a horse is 62 years and for a cow 78 years
(Matthews 1994). The oldest recorded cat was 34 years, and the oldest dog 29

 help matters, and in the meantime the individual could be subject to unnecessary
suffering.
One of the most significant advances in human geriatric medicine has been the
introduction of routine screening tests. These have brought to the fore a whole
spectrum of diseases originally thought to be rare, but now known to be common.

1.3 DEFINING THE TERM 'GERIATrIC
Organization (1963) has defined 'middle-age' as being 45-59 years, 'elderly' as
being 60-74 years and the 'aged' as over 75 years of age. In human terms the
elderly should be regarded by society as a useful resource because of their

there is no specific definition of a geriatric animal, though we all recognise external
changes in posture, reduced responsiveness to outside stimuli, and so on.
cats and dogs because breeds have differing rates of ageing, lead different life-
simplified classification scheme (Table 1.1) based upon functionality rather than
basic life stages: conception, growth, reproduction and death. Only a few species
(including humans and domesticated pets) pass through a post-reproductive
senescent stage known as 'old age'. In the wild, most animals have predators that
prevent the frail and infirm from surviving.

Wecan makeseveral observations about ageing changes:
 1. they are progressive
2. they are irreversible
 3. multiple organ systems are involved
 4. physiological mechanisms ultimately become impaired
5. variable expression is shown between individuals.
Ageing changes that may occur in tissues include:
 atrophy
 fatty infiltration
fibrosis
 delayed ability to repair
 reduced number of active cells
 reduced rate of activity
· reduced organ function.
The pigment lipofuscin is deposited in body tissues in increasing amounts with

By the time they are 7-8 years of age 95% of dogs are said to be affected by
 periodontal disease (Harvey 1988).
The occurrence of obesity increases with age probably due to:
2. reduced exercise
3. overnutrition.
Obesity can have serious effects on other body systems, e.g. cardiovascular and
skeletal systems, and may have a role in the cause of some diseases, e.g.
diabetes mellitus.
Some age-related changes that may be seen in various organ systems are listed

 reduced immunocompetence despite normal numbers of immunocytes.
Haematology

 splenomegaly with hyperplasia, haemosiderosis and haematomas
 decreased red blood cell count and haemoglobin carrying capacity
· relative anaemia (common)
· replenishment of red cells may take longer (2 x).
These types of age-related changes may impair normal physiological activities,
reduce the ability of the animal to respond to stresses, infections or other attacks
on the body, and delay healing processes. Nevertheless advanced age is not
regarded as being a disease state.

1.5 GERIATRIC DISEASES
Geriatric disease can be classified (Harrington 1988) as:
1. diseases proper to old age
 2. diseases that persist into old age
 3. diseases with a changing incidence in old age.
In many cases of frank clinical disease in older animals there will be concurrent
Many of the diseases that appear in old age are chronic and insidious, often being
present for many months or even years before the owner notices signs. Subclinical
Advancing age is, in itself, a risk factor for the development of certain diseases,
e.g. neoplasia, acute renal failure, endocardiosis.
The objectives of management of a geriatric animal are:
1. prevent or delay the onset of disease
 2. identify and ameliorate existing problems as early as possible
3. maintain body weight and condition
4. maintain quality of life.
Prolongation of life is not, in itself, a valid clinical objective if the animal will suffer
as a result of intervention and its quality of life is poor.

Endocardiosis is rarely reported in cats.
Aetiopathogenesis
The cause of the valvular lesions seen in endocardiosis is unknown, but natural
(1)  associated with ageing changes in the collagen fibres of the valves, or
(2)  valve injury progressing to a degenerative lesion.
It is commonly believed that chronic valvular disease begins in the first third of life,
progresses to cause valvular incompetence in the second third of life, and may be
associated with congestive heart failure in the last third of life, though most dogs
are likely to develop cardiac compensation and not progress to exhibit clinical signs
of failure.

Lesions most often involve the left atrioventricular valve (mitral) and less commonly
 the right atrioventricular (tricuspid) valve (see Plate 1). The aortic and pulmonary
valves are rarely affected.

matrix containing glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).
Pathophysiology
The valvular lesions result in:
(1)  inadequate closure of the valves during systole with regurgitation of blood into the
atrium
(2)  volume overload of atrium and ventricule
(3)  compensatory atrial and ventricular dilatation
(4)  myocardial hypertrophy
(5)  myocardial failure (eventually)
(6) pulmonary oedema (due to pulmonary vein compression)
(7)  left mainstem bronchus compression (causes a cough)
(9) dysrhythmias (due to stretching of chamber wall)

Sodium retention increases preload on the heart and may lead to hypertension,
oedema and ascites.
Plasma sodium concentrations may also be affected by two situations commonly
found in geriatrics:
(1)  Reduced daily water intake - the thirst centre is reported to be less sensitive to
hyperosmolarity in older animals
(2)  Renal insufficiency - leads to sodium retention.

Diuretics
Frusemide and the thiazide diuretics induce water loss by their saluretic action, so
concomitant reduction of dietary salt intake Is logical and may reduce the dose of
diuretic needed. Conversely, high salt intake in patients which have sodium
retention may increase the dose of diuretic needed.
Diuretics are indicated when the signs of congestion, oedema, ascites or volume
overload cannot be controlled by reduced salt intake alone.
Diuretics given in heart failure will reduce circulating blood volume (hypovolaemia)
thereby reducing preload effects on the heart, and loop diuretics may cause
reduced renal blood flow which also results may be undesirable as it decreases
Other undesirable effects of diuretic use include hypokalaemia,
hypohypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Relative overdosage may cause

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
KEY POINTS

&Nbsp;
(1) Age-related changes in the central and peripheral nervous
sys(CNS and PNS) are responsible for many of the
physioloand behavioural changes commonly associated with
advancing age and senility.
(2) Many of the age-related degenerative CNS changes reported to
occur in humans are believed by veterinary neurologists to
occur in dogs and cats but they have been poorly documented.
(3) In decision making about treatment and prognosis it is
important to relate observed neurological changes to the site of
 the underlesion. For example, it is important to differentiate
upper motor neuron deficits from lower motor neuron deficits
in patients with locomotor disease.
(4) The onset of seizures in old animals should promote a search
for extracranial causes (e.g. hepatic disease) and for structural
lesions in the CNS (e.g. brain tumours).
(5) Old patients requiring anticonvulsant therapy for seizures
should be screened for liver disease and should be monitored
for early detection of hepatotoxicity.
(6) Neuroendocrine disorders are probably much more common in
old animals than is currently recognised clinically.
(7) The process of ageing may be a manifestation of a failure to
regulate neuroendocrine function or ageing may be dependent
upon neuroendocrine regulation running in parallel with other
temporal factors the so-called genetic 'programming, 'clock' or
 pacemaker' theory.
(8) Regular exercise is an important stimulator of neuroendocrine
function and should be maintained throughout old age.

neuroendocrine function offers the best prospect for delaying and reversing ageing

Modification of neuroendocrine function is probably one of the mechanisms by
which calorie-restricted diets slow down ageing changes in body tissues, inhibit the

hormone for 10 days significanily increases both the peak concentration and total
amount of growth hormone released. A rapid radio-immunoassay for growth
hormone in the dog has been described (Cocola et al. 1976).
Maladaptive responses of the neuroendocrine system to stressful stimuli
accelerate the ageing process and reduce longevity. One study in rats suggests
that longevity is inversely related to hyperactivity to stress and that this is genotype
dependent. Basal cortisol levels have been reported to be increased in dogs and to
be related to cognitive dysfunction associated with ageing.

With advancing age reduced function may occur in both the sympathetic and

 proprioception and difficulty with locomotion. The animal may be less able to
respond to sudden stresses placed on it because of impaired ability to maintain
homeostasis through neuroendocrine control mechanisms.

they are rare.
Cysts of the gland of Moll
These cysts are usually small and have a vesicular appearance. They do not
cause clinical problems but can be surgically excised if necessary.
Increased tear viscosity
Increasing tear viscosity will reduce the rate of flow of tears across the corneal
surface, thus reducing the ability of the tear film to wash away particulate matter
that might collect on the surface.
Decreased lysozyme activity
Reduced lysozyme activity may lead to increased susceptibility to infection.
Corneal pigmentation
secondary to inflammation or some other corneal or uveal disease. If heavy
pigmentation is present it will result in impaired vision.
If a primary cause cannot be identified (e.g. entropion, trauma, distichiasis,
trichiasis, neoplasia (melanoma), keratitis sicca etc.) senile corneal degeneration
should be considered as a possible cause.

An age-related decrease in numbers of rods and cones results in decreased visual
acuity, and could result ultimately in visual impairment.
Retinal detachment
Retinal detachment is common in cats and an occasional finding in dogs. It is often
bilateral and is usually secondary to hypertension such as occurs in chronic renal
failure. Detachment can be slow or sudden and total detachment results in
blindness.

KEY POINTS
(1)  Chronic renal failure is common in old cats and dogs and is a
major cause of death.
(2)  It is generally accepted that chronic renal failure is a slowly
 procondition whatever the initial cause of the disease and it is
believed that proper clinical management may delay or stop
 pro gression.
(3)  Urinary incontinence and/or inappropriate urination is
comreported in dogs and cats with advancing age, and is a
major reason for euthanasia being requested by owners.
(4)  Dietary management is an important management tool in
urinary tract disorders.
(5)  Screening for evidence of renal impairment is important
 before the administration of therapeutic agents or a general
anaesthetic to old patients.

Early detection of the presence of renal failure is desirable to facilitate early
individuals in which renal excretion of drugs may be impaired, and those at risk of
developing acute renal failure if stressed by the adminisof some drugs, e.g. non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAlDs), some antibiotics or the administration
 of a general anaesthetic.
5.2 DIETARY MANAGEMENT
Dietary management is very important in the management of renal disease in older
animals due to the effect that diet has on:

Urine pH
Acidosis may occur with oliguria or severe polyuric renal failure and is due to
ammonium ions. Metabolic acidosis enhances osteodystrophy and protein
catabolism.
Acidifying diets should be avoided in animals with renal failure.
When considering the most appropriate dietary regimen for an individual case it is
important to perform a full and detailed clinical examination, because renal disease may
be associated with concomitant disease in other organ systems, e.g. pyometra (Stone et
al. 1988) and heart failure (Ralston & Fox 1988) which may influence dietary choice
Trautwein 1977) and so it frequently occurs in individuals that also have compromised
cardiac, hepatic or other organ function. The most serious disorder will usually be
managed first.
Complications may even occur within the urinary tract itself. For example, renal failure
precipitated by urinary tract obstruction due to a struvite urolith, presents the clinician with
struvite urolithiasis. In such circumstances the clinician needs to use his/her clinical

2. Glomerular Disease (nephrotic syndrome)
Protein loss into the urine accompanies glomerular disease and may lead to

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Neoplasia is the uncontrolled multiplication of abnormal cells which do not respond
the body's normal defence mechanisms. This allows them to proliferate, invade
locally, undergo metastatic spread and ultimately cause clinical signs of disease or
even death.
The key features of a neoplasm which differentiate it from other forms of cell
growth are:
(1)
excessive tissue growth
(2)
unresponsive to normal control mechanisms
(3)
Growth factors are the major regulators of mammalian cell growth in the body and
they act via receptors on the cell surface. It is known that some genes which can
across the cell membrane (Slauson & Cooper 1990).

Surgical excision is the most effective method of treatment for most canine and

The main advantage of laser surgery is the precision of application that is possible
using magnification techniques, as this minimises damage to adjacent normal
tissues, particularly when access to a tumour is difficult or the adjacent tissues are
disadvantage is the relatively high cost.
Hyperthermia
Hyperthermia has been used in the treatment of certain superficial and isolated
tumours in dogs and cats but the early success rates reported have been
disappointing. However, the technique continues to be used in human medicine -
results have been very encouraging.

Whatever the method of delivery of the radiation (by irradiation from a beam of
radioactive implants (cobalt or caesium needles); by the use of strontium probes;
or by the parenteral administration of a radioactive substance such as radioiodine)
the clinical challenge of using radiotherapy is to deliver a therapeutic dose of
radiation to the target site while minimising its delivery to normal tissues in order to
avoid excessive damage to normal tissues.
Radiotherapy is indicated for tumours which are not amenable to surand it is most

Chemotherapy
The use of cytotoxic (anticancer) drugs in isolation or in combination is an
important, if relatively recent, addition to the armoury of treatments for neoplasia in
cats and dogs. However these are potentially harmful agents and are best
administered by experienced oncologists.
As with radiotherapy the clinical skill necessary for the successful use of these

selective drugs - which usually affect the growth or cell division phase of tissues.
The most common complication is myelosuppression leading to leucopenia,
increased risk of infection and sepsis.
reason combination therapy employing lower doses of drugs with different modes
of action is usually preferred. Even with this approach multiple drug resistance can
occur with some neoplasms.

The vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine are used for the management of
for transmissible venereal tumour in dogs. Vinblastine has been used less often
mainly for primary lymphoreticular tumours and disseminated mast cell tumours.
The dose rate of vincristine for dogs and cats is in the range:
0.025-0.05 mg/kg body weight, or
0.50 mg/m2 body surface
The induction dose is usually 8 treatments at 14-21 day intervals.

 paraneoplastic syndrome - hypercalcaemia
· mechanical disorders - pain, tumour presence, post-treatment.
(2) Hypermetabolism. Increased metabolic rate resulting in increased rate of energy
utilization.
(3)  Energy competition. The neoplasm competes with the body for energy. It has been
demonstrated that tumour cells preferentially metabolise glucose using anaerobic
glycolysis, which is an energy wasting metabolic pathway, resulting in lactate
production. The glu used by the cancer is lost to the patient and the lactate produced is
converted by the Con cycle back to glucose, which further utilises energy. It has been
estimated that the rate of turnover of glucose in cancer patients is 80% greater than in
normal patients.
Dogs with lymphoma (before the development of cachexia) have increased lactate and
insulin serum concentrations compared with control dogs and therefore they have
significant alterations in carbometabolism (Vail et al. 1989). For this reason
rehydration with glucose containing or lactated Ringer's solution should be avoided.

paraneoplastic syndrome.
(5)  Impaired metabolic function. Impaired metabolic function (e.g. haematopoietic.
hepatic, renal or other) may result in impaired transportation, and metabolism of
nutrients.
(6)  Paraneoplastic syndrome. Many tumours induce metabolic changes which contribute
to cachexia.
(7)  Excessive nutrient losses. Losses may be caused by, e.g. gastrointestinal
lymphosarcoma, haemorrhage, nephrotic syndrome.

hyperlipidaemia occur in cancer patients. The latter has been associated with
immunosuppression and is possibly related to the poor survival times of some
patients. Insulin resistance and sometimes insulin deficiency both develop in some
for energy.
The mechanisms causing these metabolic changes have still to be fully elucidated,
but it is known that they can occur before weight loss. Various factors including
toxohormone, another tumour derived hormone.
So far therapeutic treatments alone have not proved successful at reversing cancer
aggressive nutritional support should be provided for patients showing significant
weight loss. Animals in a catabolic state are vulnerable to the side-effects of many
of the treatment modalities that are recommended in the management of cancer,
Feeding methods should be designed to:
(1) increase nutrient intake
(2)  inhibit gluconeogensis and glycolysis
(3) prevent glucose utilisation by the cancer cells
(4)  maintain nitrogen balance with amino acids

7.2 AGE-RELATED CHANGES THAT MAY AFFECT NUTRITION
Age-related changes that may occur and affect nutrition include:
· reduced appetite
· reduced sense of taste
· reduced sense of smell
· reduced secretions - saliva, gastrointestinal secretions (including enrymes)
· reduced absorption?
· reduced transportation?
· reduced utilisation - liver
 reduced ability to excrete waste products - liver disease, renal disease
increased requirement for nutrients - zinc?
· shift in body weight distribution from lean body mass to fat.

Obesity should be regarded as a serious problem in older cats and dogs. Obese
animals have reduced glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinaemia (Mattheeuws et a.
1984a; Mattheeuws et al. 1984b) even in the absence of frank evidence of
diabetes mellitus. Gross obesity can significantly reduce cardiovascular and
development of hepatic lipidosis and in cats and dogs it is a risk factor for the
development of diabetes mellitus.

Protein intake should be maintained near to the minimum requirement in situations
in which excessive protein intake is considered to be a risk factor for disease

It should be noted that no authorities recommend reducing protein intake below the
minimum requirement, and that in the presence of chronic renal failure protein

As long as the food contains sufficient quantities of gluconeogenic amino acids and

Water soluble vitamins are lost from the body in the urine and polyuria such as

intake to compensate for urinary losses.
Vitamin intake should probably also be encouraged in the presence of reduced
liver function.

There is concem about the amounts of some minerals in rations fed to older
animals, particularly:
Phosphorus
Sodium
Potassium
Zinc
Calcium
Phosphorus
It is known that phosphorus retention occurs frequently in animals with chronic
renal failure. This can result in calcification of various tissues including the kidneys
themselves. For this reason high dietary intake of phosphorus should be avoided in
older animals.
Controlling dietary phosphorus intake has been shown to delay the progression of
Sodium
Many older dogs have endocardiosis which, even in compensated patients, results
in sodium retention through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone

Many older dogs (particularly the brachycephalic breeds) develop a pronounced
bronchial pattem (doughnuts and tramlines) on lateral radiographs of the chest due to
thickening and calcification of the bronchial walls. These changes may or may not
be associated with respiratory signs such as abnormal respiratory sounds on

10.1 WHY SCREEN GERIATRIC PATIENTS?
Teaching Unit, University of Edinburgh, August 1991) and there is a great deal of
interest in this group of animals because of:
(1)  the effect of ageing on major body system function
(2)  the likelihood of the occurrence of subclinical disease.
Early detection of problems and routine screening for the presence of subclinical
blood and urine tests at regular intervals is useful because it helps to:
(1) detect problems early to increase the chance of successful intervention to delay or
prevent the onset and/or progression of disease
(2) provide base normals' for the individual against which future meacan be compared;
(3)  demonstrates a caring attitude towards the patient and helps to move the practice away

merit in that it allows the programme to be offered as a 'special service. My
personal experlence of running a geriatric clinic is that some owners will gladly pay
for screening tests whereas others will not.
Some practices claim that the best results may be obtained by offering the initial

As a student I was taught to perform laboratory and other investigative tests only
when they were indicated from the history and physical examination. However, my
personal experience since graduation has been that serious conditions may be
missed by selectively omitting tests from a screening profile, and I now prefer to
perform a complete screen whenever possible (see Table 10.1). Fortunately
technological advances have resulted in a significant decrease in the cost of

but the potential health hazards and the need to administer a general anaesthetic

survey ultrasonography may be useful in a geriatric screening programme.

suggest an on-going chronic disease process, and this is facilitated by the use of:
(1) a comprehensive recording system for clinical information
(2)  standardisation of clinical record keeping by clinical members of staff
(3)  the use of computers to store clinical records - because the records are less likely to be
lost or damaged and are easy to retrieve in chronorder and in a standard format.
Owners may have difficulty in recalling the full history of geriatric patients, and
often they are not as forthcoming about signs of illness which they consider to be
'normal for an old animal. A decreasing response to visual stimuli is commonly
and is not necessarily just part of the ageing process.
10.3 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Many older animals will have concomitant disease and so it is important to perform
a full clinical examination and not just focus on the problem(s) raised by the animal
(see Table 10.2).
Greying of the hair - particularly around the face and muzzle is common with
Chapter 6).
A full neurological examination is necessary to identify signs of primary or
secondary neurological deficit or increased neurological responsiveness. Both the
peripheral and central nervous systems should be examined. See Chapter 3 and

arthritis, chronic pyometra, malignant neoplasia, renal failure, hypoproteinaemia,
hypothryroidism, hyperadrenocorticism.
A low ESR (negative after correction for PCV) is seen in haemolytic anaemia.

Animals with obvious clinical signs of haemorrhage or with a regenerative anaemia
on routine screening should have their platelet count monitored. However it is a
useful examination to include in a routine screen because of the number of chronic,
subclinical conditions which can affect circuplatelets
A reduced number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) occurs due to decreased
production, increased destruction or loss from the body circuand is seen in bone
marrow disease, uraemia, toxaemia, infection, hypoadrenocortidsm, DiC, immune-
mediated disorders, myeloproliferadisorders, haemorrhage and splenomegaly.
An increased number of platelets (thrombocytosis) occurs due to excessive
disease, drug induced, some myeloproliferative disorders (most cause
thrombocytopenia) or malignant neoplasia.

the diet. As a consequence of this, and of the large number of clinical conditions
that can lead to catabolism, a high BUN, muscle wastage and weight loss are
accompanied by severe catabolism and loss of lean body mass in the cat.
Low BUN concentrations are seen in animals on low protein rations or in the
Plasma creatinine
Cat
Normal range: 40-130 mmol/l
Dog

Unlike BUN, plasma creatinine concentrations are unaffected by other systemic
factors and because it is exclusively excreted via the kidneys high concentrations
indicate reduced renal function whatever the primary cause. Creatinine is therefore
a more useful test for renal function than BUN.

not a test that measures liver function, as only a small area of liver may be
damaged to get significant increases in ALT - usually within 4-5 days. Even very
high ALT concentrations can be followed by complete recovery by the liver.
Myocarditis can also result in an increase in ALT, but this is uncommon.
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
Alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes have been identified from various organs
including the liver, bone, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney, and there is a specific
isoenzyme produced in response to steroids in dogs. Increased ALP
ALP concentrations are increased in 90% of feline hyperthyroid cases.

Crystalluria
Examination of urine sediment (in a fresh sample) can be very useful to detect
abnormal cells (e.g. blood ceils, cancer cells) and crystals. If possible the urine
should be fresh as crystals precipitate out as urine cools and other changes occur
with changes in acidity or alkalinity.
