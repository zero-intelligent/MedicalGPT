Dedication
This is dedicated to the ones we love.... including each other.
Special blessings to Drs. Heidi Barnes, Ron Johnson, John
Meeks, Shirley Shelton, Laurie Pearce, Gillian Irving, Julia
Blackmore, Linda Shell, and Tom Schubert. Many of the cases
illustrated in this book were seen when they were neurology
residents at the University of Florida, and we gratefully acknowl
edge their contributions.
We also dedicate this book to the small animal practitioners
who have consulted with us, referred the cases presented in this
book, or may have always been a bit uncomfortable dealing
with neurology.
This book was written for you

Dictionary 29th Edition, WB Saunders, Philadelphia, 2000.
Drug dosages in this book are based on recommendations found
in: Plumb DC: Veterinary Drug Handbook, 3rd ed., Iowa State
University Press, 1999.
Some of the photographs were gifts from other veterinarians and
have been used in our teaching over the years. They are
acknowledged as best as can be remembered; our apologies to
anyone we forgot to acknowledge.
Preface
This book is the culmination of the authors' 65 years of
combined experience practicing clinical veterinary neurology
and neurosurgery, teaching neurology to veterinary students, and
providing general practitioners with hundreds of hours of phone
consultations and continuing education in neurology. All the
authors have been in general small animal practice at some time
in their careers, and this book was designed as a practical, quick
reference handbook of common neurologic problems for the busy
small animal practitioner.
The first section is a review of the clinical approach to patients,
the neurologic examination, and an overview of lesion localiza-
tion. The following sections begin with a chief complaint,
definitions related to the problem, the location of the lesion, and
the differential diagnosis. The frequency of occurrence of each
disorder is indicated, and the focus of the text is on common and
occasional disorders. Rare disorders are usually listed in a table or
presented in a brief paragraph at the end of the section for
completeness. For each problem, important historical questions,
abnormal physical and neurologic examination findings and
applicable diagnostic tests are initially reviewed. Finally, the
important diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic features of
each disorder are presented.
Many sections have quick-reference, emergency treatment tables
with specific drugs and doses. Charts of lesion localization,
common treatment approaches, and nursing care and physical
therapy are also included. Other treatments are bolded in the
discussion for repeated quick reference. Warning boxes are
placed throughout the text, emphasizing problems in specific
situations that occur in practice. Advice to owners for special
situations can be found in other tables. A companion CD is
available. Please see "Some Helpful Hints" on page 3.
As in other specialties, all neurologists may not agree on diag
nostic criteria, treatments, and prognoses for various disorders,
and the information in this book is based on the scientific litera
ture as well as our combined clinical experience. It was our
intent to have this book live up to its name “Neurology Made
Easy" for the small animal practitioner. It is our wish that this
handbook will be a useful practical guide to help veterinarians
deal more effectively with small animal neurologic patients and
clients and be an educated part of the team when assistance from
a specialist is required.

Neuroanatomy
 The nervous system (Figure 1-1) is composed of billions of
neurons. Each neuron consists of a cell body with one or more
processes known as dendrites and axons. Dendrites bring information
to the cell body, and another process, known as an axon, transmits
information to other neurons or muscles. Neurons connect and form
electrochemical circuits that receive and transmit electrical signals
and ensure proper function of all body systems.
V Glial cells outnumber neurons in the nervous system and
consist of three main types: oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and
microglia. The glial cells surround the neurons and perform many
important functions, such as structural support, myelination,
formation of the blood-brain barrier, regulation of metabolic
function, and immunologic defense.

 The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and
spinal cord. The protective covering of the CNS, called the
meninges, consists of three layers: the dura mater, arachnoid
membrane, and pia mater. The area between the arachnoid
membrane and pia mater is the subarachnoid space.
 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounds the CNS in the
subarachnoid space. CSF is also found inside the CNS in a series
of four connecting cavities within the brain, known as ventricles,
and a central canal in the spinal cord. CSF is produced inside
the ventricles by structures known as the choroid plexuses and
flows caudally into the subarachnoid space where it is absorbed.
CSF provides structural and metabolic support and environ-
mental protection for the CNS.
 The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the CNS to
the rest of the body and is formed by neurons entering and leaving
the brainstem (cranial nerves) and spinal cord (spinal nerves).
0 The brain resides within the protective covering of the skull
and consists of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. The
brainstem is subdivided from rostral to caudal into the dien-
cephalon (includes the thalamus, epithalamus, subthalamus, and
hypothalamus), midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata (Figure 1-
1). Cranial nerves are associated with specific brain or brainstem
regions and form the PNS of the head. There are 12 pairs of
cranialnerves.
 The spinal cord resides within the protective covering of
the bony vertebral column. Spinal nerves enter and exit between
the vertebrae to form the PNS of the trunk and limbs. The
spinal cord and corresponding nerve roots (the most proximal
part of each spinal nerve) are divided into 8 cervical (C), 13
thoracic (T), 7 lumbar (L),3 sacral (S), and usually 5 or more
caudal (Cd) segments. Each vertebra, spinal cord segment, and
group of nerve roots is numbered as follows: C1-8, T1-13, L1-7,
S1-3, and Cd1-5. Thus, C2 means the second cervical vertebra,
spinal cord segment, or nerve root and L5 means the fifth lumbar
vertebra, spinal cord segment, or nerve root.
 The spinal cord segments and nerve roots do not directly
align with the vertebrae of the same number. There are eight
cervical spinal cord segments and nerve roots and only seven
cervical vertebrae. The nerve roots C1-C7 enter and exit the
spinal canal along the cranial edge of the vertebrae of the same
number, and nerve roots caudal to C8 enter and exit along the
caudal edge of the vertebrae of the same number. The spinal cord
5
segments generally lie slightly cranial to the vertebrae of the
       x  
the spinal cord segments shorten and end at approximately the
L6 vertebra in dogs and the L7 vertebra in cats. The collection
of nerve roots from L7-Cd5 continues in the vertebral canal and
forms the cauda equina. The neurologic examination localizes
the lesion to certain spinal cord segments and nerve roots, but
the corresponding vertebral localization must be considered in
order to radiograph the correct area.

special senses such as olfaction, vision, equilibrium, hearing, and
taste as well as the somatic senses of touch, pain, temperature,
and proprioception (Figure 1-3). The PNS sensory nerves receive
stimulation either directly or from special receptor cells. The
stimulus is then transmitted to their cell bodies located in PNS
ganglia. Sensory nerve axons enter the CNS and connect with
nuclei (groups of neuronal cell bodies in the CNS) in the
brainstem or spinal cord. CNS sensory neurons leave the nuclei
and ascend to the brain in organized sensory tracts often named
by where they begin and end. Examples include the spinocere-
bellar tract (beginning in the spinal cord and ending in the
cerebellum) or the spinothalamic tract (beginning in the spinal
cord and ending in the thalamic portion of the diencephalon).
The main sensory tracts of the spinal cord are shown in Figure 1-4.

 Motor or efferent nerves are responsible for the movements of
all skeletal and smooth muscles. Motor nerves originate in the nuclei
of the cerebrum and brainstem and descend through organized tracts.
These tracts are often named by where they begin and end, such as
the vestibulospinal tract (beginning in the vestibular nuclei of the 
medulla oblongata and ending in the spinal cord). The main motor
tracts of the spinal cord are shown in Figure 1-4.

V Upper motor neurons form the motor tracts (Figures 1-3 and 1-4).
V Lower motor neurons form the peripheral nerves that
innervate the skeletal and visceral muscles (Figure 1-3).
V Interneurons connect the upper and lower motor neurons
within the brainstem and spinal cord and are often part of the
reflex arc.
V Gray matter is primarily composed of neuronal cell bodies and
their dendrites within the CNS (Figure 1-4).
V White matter of the CNS is primarily composed of axons (Figure
1-4). Many of the axons are covered with a sheath of myelin formed
by oligodendrocytes, which gives the region a white color.
V A reflex arc is composed of a peripheral sensory nerve and a
lower motor neuron and their connection within a specific
brainstem or spinal cord segment. Most spinal reflexes are multi-
synaptic and include an interneuron (Figure 1-3). The patellar
reflex discussed below is monosynaptic and has no interneuron.
If all the components of the reflex arc are functional, then the
reflex will be present even if the upper motor neurons are
severely damaged.

/ The primary complaint is the reason for seeking medical assis-
tance, such as seizures, dysequilibrium, and paraplegia. The most
common primary complaints are listed in the Table of Contents
as the title for each section of this book.

 The history is a series of questions to determine the most
likely cause of the primary complaint and to assist in making a
definitive diagnosis, a treatment plan, and an accurate prognosis.
Onset and progression of the primary complaint may be neonatal
nonprogressive, acute nonprogressive, acute progressive, chronic
progressive, or episodic (Table 1-1). Neonatal nonprogressive
disorders become apparent shortly after birth and remain
unchanged. Animals with acute nonprogressive disorders develop
signs immediately or within 72 hours of the eliciting cause and
then remain unchanged. Animals with acute progressive
disorders develop signs that progressively worsen immediately or
within 72 hours of the event. Animals with chronic progressive
disorders develop signs that continue to worsen over several days,
weeks, or months. Animals with episodic disorders are normal
between signs. Duration of the signs may affect treatment
options. A thorough investigation of other neurologic signs,
concurrent or previous illness, vaccination status, the possibility
of trauma or exposure to toxins, similar familial problems, travel
history, current medications and supplements, and lifestyle are
essential to accurately determine the cause of the primary
complaint. Important historical questions are outlined for each
primary complaint in the following chapters.
Y A complete physical examination is essential to detect abnor-
malities in other body systems that might cause a disorder that
also affects the nervous system. Diseases that may mimic primary
neurologic diseases, such as arrhythmias and orthopedic disease,
can also be identified. Since some diagnostic tests are performed
under anesthesia, the physical examination is important to assess
anesthetic risks.
Y The neurologic examination is a special series of observations
and tests to determine if there is a neurologic problem, its
location in the nervous system, its severity, and whether the
deficit is symmetric or asymmetric. Some mechanisms of disease
produce primarily symmetric or asymmetric signs (Table 1-1).
 The differential diagnosis is a list of possible mechanisms of
disease and the specific diseases for each mechanism that are
most compatible with the information obtained in the history
and physical and neurologic examinations (Table 1-1).
 The diagnostic plan may initially include a complete blood
count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and urinalysis to detect
systemic disease and to further evaluate the animal for potential
anesthesia and additional diagnostic tests. It is assumed that
10
Evaluation of the thoracic and abdominal cavities by radiography
and ultrasonography is often performed if neoplasia is on the
differential diagnosis list or if historical or physical examination
abnormalities warrant further investigation. Further diagnostic
tests can be performed to determine the most likely diagnosis
(Table 1-2). Suggested diagnostic tests for specific problems are
listed in each chapter of this book
V Once the differential diagnosis, diagnostic plan, and likely
prognoses are established, they are presented to the pet owner,
and the potential benefits and risks and estimate of the charges
are discussed.
 Anesthesia carries some risk in any animal and varies with
age, body condition, and concurrent illness. Anesthesia is
required for most advanced neurologic tests.
 CSF collection is avoided in animals suspected to have
increased intracranial pressure, as the cerebellum may herniate
through the foramen magnum, compress the caudal brainstem,
and cause death. Caution is also exerted in animals with
increased bleeding tendencies. Significant hemorrhage and
worsening of neurologic deficits are very rare complications of
CSF collection.
% Myelography may transiently worsen neurologic deficits but
improvement is often seen within 24 to 72 hours.
 Surgical biopsy carries the usual risks of hemorrhage or infection.
 Final diagnosis: The results of all diagnostic tests are
evaluated, and the most likely diagnosis is established.
Y Therapeutic plan: A therapeutic plan is developed on the
basis of the diagnosis and therapeutic history. For the welfare of
the animal, some therapeutic interventions may be necessary
before the results of all the diagnostic tests have been obtained
and a final diagnosis is secured. Therapy may be medical,
surgical, or a combination of both.
Y Commmunication plan: Once established, the diagnosis, ther.
apeutic plan, and prognosis are presented to the pet owner. The
communication plan involves a clear explanation of the risks,
benefits, and costs of all treatments.

The Neurologic
Examination Overview
and Form
V The neurologic examination is performed to determine if a
neurologic problem is present, where it is located in the nervous
system, how severe it is, and what might be causing it.
 The neurologic examination, starting from the front to back of
the animal, may be divided into the evaluation of the head, gait,
neck and thoracic limbs, back, pelvic limbs, anus, and tail. A
chart to assist with the examination and to record the results is
useful (Table 1-3).

Evaluation of the Head
V Head evaluation is performed by questioning the owner about
seizures and changes in mentation, observation of the animal,
palpation of the head, and examination of cranial nerve reflexes.
V Seizures may be witnessed but are often an historical finding
and indicate dysfunction of the cerebrum or diencephalon.
V Mentation is a term that describes the animal's state of
awareness and ability to respond appropriately to the environ-
ment. Mentation can first be observed while collecting the
initial history. The owner's opinion of any behavior changes is
important to note. A depressed animal is quiet but responds
appropriately. A demented animal is awake but dull and responds
inappropriately. Pet owners may complain that the personality
has changed or that the animal does not recognize them.
Delirium is hysterical behavior. Rage or aggression is commonly a
behavioral or neuropsychiatric problem but occasionally can
result from primary brain disease. Stupor is a somnolent state
with reduced responses to most environmental stimuli except
pain. Coma is a state of unconsciousness with a lack of response
to any environmental stimuli. Lesions of the cerebrum and dien-
cephalon produce dementia, delirium, rage, stupor, and coma.
Lesions of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata produce
stupor and coma.
V Head pressing occurs when the animal pushes the top of its
head against a wall and indicates a lesion of the cerebrum
or diencephalon.
V Head turning occurs toward the side of the lesion and is
caused by lesions of the cerebrum and diencephalon. Animals
with neck pain may carry the head low and more to one side. In
a head turn, both ears are level, which allows this condition to
be differentiated from a head tilt. A head turn is often accompa-
nied by circling.
V Head incoordination and tremors may be observed with
movement of the head or during attempts to eat and drink. This
usually indicates a lesion of the cerebellum.
15
V A head tilt is when the head is cocked to one side and one ear
is closer to the ground. A head tilt indicates a lesion of the
vestibular system (the vestibular nerve cranial nerve 8], the
vestibular nuclei in the rostral medulla oblongata, or the floccu-
lonodular lobe of the cerebellum). The head tilts toward the
lesion in vestibular nerve disease, toward or away from the lesion
in medulla oblongata disease, and away from the lesion in cere-
bellar disease.
V Twelve pairs of cranial nerves (CN) line the left and right
sides of the brain and brainstem. The CN are numbered 1 to 12
as follows: CN 1 = olfactory, CN 2 = optic, CN 3 = oculomotor,
CN 4 = trochlear, CN 5 = trigeminal, CN 6 = abducens, CN 7=
facial, CN 8 = vestibular, CN 9 = glossopharyngeal, CN 10 =
vagus, CN 11= spinal accessory, and CN 12 = hypoglossal. Signs
of dysfunction indicate a disease of the cranial nerve or its nuclei
in the brainstem on the same side (ipsilateral), except for
olfactory, optic, and the trochlear nerves. Vision and olfaction
have some bilateral input; the trochlear nerve crosses to the
opposite side within the brainstem. Some reduction of cranial
 nerve function may be observed in cerebral and diencephalic lesions.
V Olfaction is the function of the olfactory nerves (CN 1) and
can be tested by offering food and observing whether the animal
can locate the food with its sense of smell (Figure 1-5). Most
animals that cannot smell will not eat, so questioning the owner
about the appetite is important. Noxious substances should not
be used for testing because they evaluate the sensory portion of
the trigeminal nerves (CN 5) and not CN 1.
Figure 1-5 Testing smell with
food (can blindfold the animal if
concerned that it is seeing the
food instead of smelling it).
16
V The menace response evaluates the optic nerves (CN 2),
facial nerves (CN 7), and a complex set of pathways through the
brainstem, brain, and cerebellum. Advancing a hand or fingers
toward the eye and observing an eyelid blink tests the menace
response (Figure 1-6). One eye is covered to test each eye sepa-
rately. Care is taken not to touch the eyelid or whiskers or to
make air currents that might stimulate the sensory portion of the
trigeminal nerves (CN 5).
V Vision is the function of the optic nerves (CN 2), the dien-
cephalon, and the occipital lobe of the cerebrum. In addition to
the menace response, vision is tested by observing the animal in
an unfamiliar environment to see if it bumps into objects or by
throwing cotton balls (which do not produce a localizing sound)
and watching for signs of recognition as they pass through the
animal's visual field. Vision may also be tested by observing the
animal focus on an object (Figure 1-7).
Figure 1-6 Testing the menace
response.
Figure 1-7 Observing the
response to a visual stimulus.
17
V The pupil size is observed in normal room light. Pupils are usually
midrange in normal room light unless the animal is fearful or excited
In normal animals, fear, excitement, and reduction of ambient light
cause the pupils to become larger (mydriasis). A reduction in pupil
diameter (miosis) occurs with increases in ambient light if the
animal is not fearful or excited or has intraocular disease. Mydriasis
may occur with lesions of the retina, optic nerves (CN 2), oculo-
motor nerves (CN 3), or the midbrain. Midrange size pupils that do
not respond to light may be associated with midbrain lesions. Miotic
pupils may be associated with lesions of the cerebrum,
diencephalon, and the CNS and PNS sympathetic nerves that
innervate the pupil (Section 6)
V The pupillary light reflex evaluates the optic nerves (CN 2)
and the oculomotor nerves (CN 3) and can be tested by shining a
light into one pupil and observing pupillary constriction in the eye
tested (the direct response) and in the opposite eye (the consen-
sual response) (Figure 1-8). If either the direct or consensual
responses are absent, then a lesion is affecting CN 2 or CN 3 and
their associated pathways through the diencephalon and midbrain.
Excited or fearful animals may have a reduced direct and consensual
pupillary light reflex. A strong light source should be used because a
weak light source may not induce pupil constriction. Lesions of CN
2 and CN 3 usually produce mydriasis as well as a reduced or absent
pupillary light reflex.
V Strabismus occurs when one or both eyes deviate into an
abnormal position due to paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles.
Figure 1-8 Testing the pupillary
light reflex.
18
Ventrolateral strabismus (down and outward position) occurs with
lesions of the oculomotor nerves (CN 3) or their nuclei in the
midbrain. A lateral rotation of the eyeball occurs with lesions of the
trochlear nerve (CN 4) or their nuclei in the midbrain but is only
obvious in cats because of their vertical pupils. Medial strabismus
(inward position) occurs with lesions of the abducens nerves (CN 6).
V Positional strabismus is an abnormal eye position due to a lesion
of the vestibular system (CN 8, medulla oblongata, and cere-
bellum). If head tilt is also present, when the head is straightened and
the nose is elevated, ventral strabismus (eye drop) is observed on the
side of the lesion.
V Ptosis is a weakness of the levator muscles that open the eyelid
and results in reduction of the diameter of the palpebral fissure. Ptosis
is most commonly associated with lesions of the oculomotor nerves
(CN 3) or their nuclei in the midbrain or the sympathetic nerves to
the eyelid. Ptosis may be secondary to enophthalmos.
V Enophthalmos is a backward displacement of the eyeball into
the orbit that induces a passive elevation of the third eyelid and
a slight reduction in the diameter of the palpebral fissure.
Enophthalmos is most commonly associated with lesions of the
sympathetic nerves to the periorbital muscles but can occur with
stimulation of the abducens nerves (CN 6), as seen in tetanus.
V Globe retraction (corneal reflex) occurs when the eyelids are
held open and the cornea is gently touched. Loss of this reflex
occurs in lesions of the sensory portion of the trigeminal nerves
(CN 5) and their connections in the pons and medulla
oblongata and lesions of the abducens nerves (CN 6) or their
nuclei in the rostral medulla oblongata.
V Intranasal sensation is tested by inserting a hemostat into the
nostril, which induces the animal to move the head away to avoid the
stimulus. Loss of intranasal sensation occurs with lesions of the
trigeminal nerves (CN 5) as well as of the complex set of pathways
through the brainstem, diencephalon, and cerebrum.
V Temporal and masseter muscle atrophy is evaluated by visual
observation and palpation and is associated with cachexia as well
as with lesions of the trigeminal nerves (CN 5), their nuclei in
the pons, and with primary muscle diseases.
V Jaw tone and range of motion are observed by opening and
closing the mouth. Loss of jaw tone is usually associated with
bilateral lesions of the trigeminal nerves (CN 5). Restricted
range of motion is often caused by a primary myopathy.
19
/ The palpebral reflex is elicited by touching the medial or lateral
canthus of the eye, which causes closure of the eyelids (Figure 1-9).
The aural reflexes are elicited by touching or pinching the ear and
the buccal reflexes by touching the lip and observing their
movement. Facial sensation arises from the trigeminal nerves
(CN 5), and movement of the facial muscles (the eyelids, ears, and
lips) is controlled by the facial nerves (CN 7). Loss of the palpebral,
aural or buccal reflex indicates a lesion of CN 5, CN 7 or their
connections in the pons and rostral medulla oblongata.
Figure 1-9 Testing the palpebral
reflex.
V Normal or physiologic nystagmus is induced when the head is
moved. As the head is moving, the eyes move slowly (slow
phase) away from the direction of head movement then rapidly
snap back (fast phase) toward that side. As the head is moved to
the left, the fast phase is to the left; when moved to the right,
the fast phase is to the right. As the head is moved up, the fast
phase is up; when moved down, the fast phase is down. These
eye movements are repeated several times when the head is
moved from side to side or up and down. Normal nystagmus
requires the integrity of the vestibular nerves (CN 8), oculo-
motor nerves (CN 3), trochlear nerves (CN 4), abducens nerves
(CN 6), and their connections through the brainstem.
V Spontaneous or pathologic nystagmus occurs without head
movement with lesions of the vestibular system (vestibular
nerves [CN 8], rostral medulla oblongata, or cerebellum).
Positional nystagmus is induced when the animal is placed in
lateral or dorsal recumbency and indicates a vestibular system
lesion. As with physiologic nystagmus, spontaneous and posi-
20
tional nystagmus have a fast and slow phase. The fast phase often
occurs away from the side of the lesion. With horizontal
nystagmus, the eyes go from side to side in a straight, horizontal
plane. With rotatory nystagmus, the eyes go side to side in a
horizontal plane but form an arc. With vertical nystagmus, the
eyes go up and down in a vertical direction.
V Hearing is crudely tested by observing a response to such
noises as whistling, yelling, hand clapping, or clanging metal
against metal. Care should be taken not to create vibrations or
visual cues that would induce a false-positive response. Loss of
hearing is usually associated with lesions of the middle ear, inner
ear, or cochlear nerves (CN 8).
V Swallowing is evaluated by applying external pressure to the
hyoid bones to stimulate swallowing or stimulating the pharynx
with a finger to elicit a gag response (Figure 1-10). Swallowing
dysfunction is associated with lesions of the pharyngeal muscles,
glossopharyngeal nerves (CN 9), vagus nerves (CN 10), or
caudal medulla oblongata.
Figure 1-10 Testing the swallow-
ing reflex.
V Regurgitation may be observed or noted in the history and is
often caused by megaesophagus. Megaesophagus can result from
lesions of the vagus nerves (CN 10) or the caudal medulla
oblongata but is usually secondary to diseases of the esophageal
muscles or neuromuscular junction.
V A voice change (dysphonia) may be observed or noted in the
history and can be due to lesions of the laryngeal muscles, vagus
nerves (CN 1O), or the caudal medulla oblongata.
V Stridor—a harsh, high-pitched respiratory sound often associ-
ated with inspiration—can be heard with the bare ear or a
stethoscope. This sign is associated with unilateral or bilateral
21
laryngeal paresis or paralysis associated with lesions of the
laryngeal muscles, vagus nerves (CN 1O), or the caudal medulla
oblongata. Dyspnea with cyanosis can also occur and constitutes
an emergency situation.
V Trapezius and brachiocephalicus muscle atrophy may be
palpated in rare instances of lesions affecting the spinal accessory
nerves (CN 11).
V Tongue atrophy or weakness may be evaluated when the
animal is drinking or by direct visual inspection, manipulation,
and palpation. Unilateral lesions of the hypoglossal nerves
(CN 12) produce these signs. In chronic lesions, the tongue
contracts and becomes fibrotic on the affected side.
Evaluation of the Gait
 A normal gait requires proper function of sensory and motor
peripheral nerves and connected pathways through the spinal cord,
brainstem, and cerebellum. The cerebrum is less important for a
normal gait in animals, and cerebral lesions usually cause only subtle
Or temporary gait deficits. It is usually best to have an assistant walk,
trot, and turn the animal to maximize the clinician's ability to
observe. Watching the animal roam freely is also helpful. If only the
pelvic limbs are abnormal, then a lesion below T2 is suspected. If all
four limbs are affected, then a lesion above T2 is suspected. If the
animal is nonambulatory, it should be supported and an attempt made
to assist it in walking so any voluntary movement can be assessed.
V Hemiwalking involves supporting the animal by picking up the
limbs on one side and pushing it forward and sideways so that it is
forced to walk on the limbs of one side only (Figure 1-11). By
comparing sides, it can be determined if one side is more affected
than the other.
V Wheelbarrowing involves supporting the pelvic limbs and
observing the animal's ability to walk on the thoracic limbs alone.
This technique can detect thoracic limb deficits not appreciated
during the gait evaluation (Figure 1-12). In quadriparetic animals, this
test may be used to determine if the thoracic limbs are more or less
involved than the pelvic limbs, but supporting the chest is essential to
preclude falling and neck injury. Extension of the neck during wheel-
barrowing may accentuate thoracic limb deficits. Supporting the
thoracic limbs and forcing the animal to walk on the hind limbs
alone can be useful to evaluate the hind limbs.
V Lameness is most often seen with orthopedic disease but may occa-
sionally be caused by lesions that irritate the nerve roots, which
innervate thelimb.

wheelbarrowing on thoracic limbs.
V Ataxia is an uncoordinated gait and is caused by lesions of the
sensory peripheral nerves, spinal cord, brainstem, vestibular
system, or cerebellum. Hypermetria and hypometria are types of
ataxia. Hypermetria refers to exaggerated motion and is associ-
ated with excessive flexion and over-reaching of the limbs.
Hypometria is reduced flexion and under-reaching of the limbs
during movement.
V Ataxia with limb paresis (weakness) may be due to peripheral
nerve, spinal cord, or brainstem lesions. Paresis is not seen in
cerebellar lesions.
W Paresis is weakness or impaired motor function due to a neuro-
logic or myopathic cause. The severity may vary from mild weakness
 i s sid  a      
volumtary movement is present. Care must be taken not to confuse
23
reflex activity with voluntary movement. The spinal reflexes are
preserved and often become exaggerated if the components of the
reflex arc are still intact (Figure 1-3). In severe spinal cord lesions
between T3 and L3, the pelvic limb reflexes become so exaggerated
that reflex flexion and extension can occur with the slightest stimulus
and mimic voluntary movement. This phenomenon is known as
spinal walking and can be present even if the spinal cord is function-
ally severed. Spinal walking can be difficult to differentiate from
voluntary movements unless deep pain is present.
V Paraparesis is paresis of the pelvic limbs resulting from a lesion
located behind T2. Quadriparesis (tetraparesis) is paresis of all
four limbs caused by a lesion located above T2 or diffuse neuromus-
cular disease. Hemiparesis is paresis of the limbs on one side due to
a lesion located above T2. Lesions from the caudal midbrain to T2
cause ipsilateral hemiparesis (the lesion is on the same side as the
paresis). Lesions from the rostral midbrain to the cerebrum cause
contralateral hemiparesis (the lesion is on the opposite side of the
paresis). Paresis of the thoracic limbs is usually more subtle than the
pelvic limbs and is often manifested as a choppy, short-strided gait.
V Paralysis is total loss of all voluntary movement (reflex
movements may still be intact but do not indicate spinal cord
integrity above the reflex level). Paraplegia is paralysis of the
pelvic limbs only. Quadriplegia (tetraplegia) is paralysis of all four
limbs. Hemiplegia is paralysis of the limbs on one side.
V Circling or pacing usually indicates a lesion of the cerebrum or
diencephalon. Animals usually circle toward the side of the
lesion. In animals with a head tilt, circling is usually caused by a
lesion of the vestibular system.
Evaluation of the Neck, Thoracic
Limbs, Back, Pelvic Limbs, Anus,
and Tail
 Evaluation of these parts of the patient's anatomy can detect
subtle abnormalities that can help determine whether the lesion is
located above T2 or below T2. The function of each individual
limb can be compared, and asymmetry that can localize the lesion
to one side may be noted.
Postural Reactions
V Hopping is evaluated by lifting three limbs and pushing the
animal laterally to observe their ability to walk or hop on each
24
thoracic or pelvic limb independently (Figure 1-13). In large dogs,
lifting only the opposite thoracic or pelvic limb is adequate for
evaluation, but support is necessary to prevent falling. Most
animals do not hop well in a medial direction. Equal responses
should be seen on both sides. Minor ataxia or weakness of a
thoracic or pelvic limb may be detected.
Figure 1-13 Evaluation of the
hopping response on one
thoracic limb.
V Conscious proprioception (CP) can be a very important tool to
detect subtle dysfunction and confirm that a neurologic disease is
present when other signs are minimal. The animal is supported
under the chest or between the pelvic limbs, and the paw is turned
so that the dorsal surface contacts the ground (Figure 1-14). The
animal should return the paw to the correct position within a few
seconds. The animal should not lean against the examiner, nor
should the examiner support all of the animal's weight. Consistent
CP deficits indicate a nervous system lesion and are not caused by
an orthopedic disease (Figure 1-15).
Figure 1-14 Evaluation of
conscious proprioception in a
pelvic limb.
25
Figure 1-15 Absent conscious proprioception; the dog stays standing on the
dorsal surface of the paw indicating a neurologic lesion.
V Appropriate CP responses require the integrity of sensory
systems (peripheral nerve, spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral
cortex) to perceive the paw position and motor systems (cerebral
cortex, brainstem, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle) to
correct the paw position. Therefore, although it is a good test to
document neurologic dysfunction, it does not localize a lesion to
any specific site. CP deficits found in animals with a cranial
nerve problem indicate that the lesion could be in the brainstem
segment rather than in the peripheral nerve, which changes the
differential diagnosis, diagnostic plan, and prognosis. Deficits of
CP found in animals that are having difficulty rising indicate a
neurologic disorder and not just an orthopedic disorder, which
may also be present.
Spinal Cord Reflexes
 Spinal cord reflexes pass through specific peripheral nerves and
spinal cord segments (Figure 1-3), so if a spinal reflex is depressed or
absent the lesion is localized to that specific nerve or spinal cord
segment. Spinal reflexes are best tested in a relaxed animal held in
lateral recumbency by an assistant. The limb to be tested may be
gently flexed and extended to ensure a normal range of motion and
relaxation. A percussion hammer (pleximeter) is used to briskly tap
tendons and muscles to elicit the appropriate response. If the animal
is too tense or the limb has tendon contraction, then spinal reflexes
will not be evaluated accurately. It is most important to determine if
the spinal reflexes are depressed or absent. Although hyperreflexia
26
may be associated with a lesion of the upper motor neurons, in the
absence of other neurologic deficits it means little. Nervous dogs may
exhibit hyperactive spinal reflexes.
V Thoracic limb spinal reflexes and their spinal cord segments,
 nerve roots, and peripheral nerves include the following:
 Biceps tendon reflex (C6-8 and the musculocutaneous
nerves): Put the thumb on the biceps tendon and tap with a
percussion hammer. Feel or observe biceps tendon contraction
and elbow flexion (Figure 1-16).
 Triceps tendon reflex (C7-T2 and the radial nerves): Put
the forefinger on the triceps tendon and tap with a percussion
hammer, and feel or observe triceps tendon contraction and
elbow extension (Figure 1-17).
Figure 1-16 Testing the biceps
reflex.
Figure 1-17 Testing the triceps
reflex.
27
 Extensor carpi radialis reflex (C7-T2 and the radial nerves):
Tap the extensor carpi radialis muscle with a percussion hammer,
and observe extension of the carpus (Figure 1-18).
 Flexor reflex (C7-T2 and the radial, axillary, musculocuta-
neous, median, and ulnar nerves): The flexor reflex is also
known as the withdrawal or toe-pinch reflex. Sensory input is
through the radial, median, and ulnar nerves, and motor output is
through C7-T2 spinal cord segments and nerve roots and the
axillary, musculocutaneous, median, and ulnar nerves. The toe is 
pinched by the examiner's fingers or with a hemostat to elicit
flexion of the shoulder, elbow, carpus, and sometimes digits
(Figure 1-19). If this reflex is absent, each toe can be tested indi-
vidually to determine if specific deficits of the radial, median, or
ulnar nerves are present (see Section 14).
Figure 1-18 Testing the ext carpi
radialis reflex.
Figure 1-19 Testing the flexor
reflex of thoracic limb.
28
Y Crossed extensor reflex: When the animal is relaxed in lateral
recumbency and inducing the flexor reflex results in extension of the
limb on the opposite side, a lesion above C7 is suspected. Care should
be taken to ensure the animal was not trying to rise during the
testing, as this will cause extension of the opposite limb as well.
V Pelvic limb, anal, and tail spinal reflexes and their spinal cord
segments, nerve roots, and nerves include the following:
 Patellar reflex (L4-5 and the femoral nerves): Tap the
patellar tendon briskly with the percussion hammer to elicit
extension of the stifle (Figure 1-20).
Y Gastocnemius reflex (L6-S2 and tibial nerves): Hold the
gastocnemius muscle between the thumb and forefinger, and
tap the thumb briskly with the percussion hammer to elicit
extension of the hock (Figure 1-21).
Figure 1-20 Testing the patellar
reflex.
Figure 1-21 Testing the gastroc-
nemius reflex.
29
 Cranial tibial reflex (L6-S2 and the sciatic and peroneal
nerves): Tap the cranial tibial muscle briskly with the percus-
sion hammer to elicit flexion of the hock (Figure 1-22).
Y Sciatic reflex (L6-S2 and the sciatic and peroneal nerves):
Place a finger on the sciatic nerve in the notch formed by the
greater trochanter and the ischiatic tuberosity, and tap the
finger to elicit brief extension of the hock (Figure 1-23).
Figure 1-22 Testing the cranial
tibial musclereflex.
Figure 1-23 Testing the sciatic
nerve reflex.
30
Y Flexor reflex (L6-S2 and the sciatic and peroneal nerves):
On a pelvic limb, the examiner pinches the toe with fingers
or a hemostat, and flexion of the hip, stifle, hock, and
sometimes the digits is elicited (Figure 1-24).
Y Crossed extensor reflex: If the opposite limb extends when
the flexor reflex is elicited (Figure 1-25), then a crossed extensor
reflex is observed. When the animal is in lateral recumbency and
not trying to rise, a crossed extensor reflex of the pelvic limb
usually indicates a lesion above spinal cord segment L6.
Figure 1-24 Testing the flexor
reflex of the pelvic limb.
Figure 1-25 A crossed extensor reflex.
31
Y Anal reflex (S1-3 and pudendal nerves): The perineal area on
each side is pinched with a hemostat, and the anal sphincter will
constrict (Figure 1-26). If a reduced reflex is suspected, a gloved
finger is inserted into the anus. If the reflex is normal, a strong
contraction of the anal sphincter will occur.
 Tail reflex (S1-Cd5 and the caudal nerves of the tail): As the
perineal area is stimulated with a hemostat or finger, flexion of
the tail toward the anus will occur.
Figure 1-26
Testing the anal reflex.
Miscellaneous
 The Babinski's sign can be tested in the thoracic and pelvic
limbs by stroking the plantar and palmar surface of the
metacarpal or metatarsal region in a brisk, upward motion with
the tip of a percussion hammer handle (Figure 1-27). A slight
flexion of the digits is normally seen. A positive Babinski's sign is
noted when the digits extend and flare out, indicating an upper
motor neuron lesion above C6 for the thoracic limb and above
L6 for the pelvic limb.
 Muscle atrophy may be associated with disuse or from lower
motor neuron or muscle disease. Disuse of a limb causes a
symmetric reduction in muscle size diffusely over the limb.
Muscle atrophy associated with specific nerve or muscle disease
is usually focal and more severe than disuse atrophy. Generalized
muscle atrophy occurs in polyneuropathies and polymyopathies
(see Sections 10 and 11).
 Urination is observed to detect involvement of the micturition
pathways. Reflex urination or inability to urinate is common in
animals with spinal cord lesions and must be properly managed.
32
Figure 1-27 Testing for Babinski's
sign.
 Tail wagging when the dog is spoken to or ofered food is usually
voluntary and indicates integrity of the nervous system from head
 segments when the limb spinal reflexes are tested.
Pain Perception
 Palpation and manipulation to detect painful areas and testing
pain perception are usually performed last so that the animal will
remain cooperative during the rest of the neurologic examination.
If the animal exhibits severe neck or back pain, the neurologic
examination may be modified so that undue stress to the pet or
owner is avoided
Y Neck pain may be observed as a reluctance to move the head or
to look upward. In severe cases, the animal may hold the head
down with the neck extended. Spontaneous muscle spasms of the
neck may cause jerky neck movements and vocalization. Deep
palpation of the cervical musculature or movement of the neck in
dorsal, ventral, and side-to-side directions may also elicit tensing,
muscle spasms, and vocalization (Figure 1-28). Neck pain is most
often associated with cervical lesions but occasionally may be asso
ciated with intracranial disease (see Section 7). Diseases affecting
the cervical vertebrae, sensory nerve roots, or meninges usually
cause some degree of discomfort.
 Back pain may be expressed by arching the back, muscle
tension or spasms, and vocalizing when the paravertebral muscu-
lature is palpated. Careful palpation can usually narrow the area
of discomfort to within two to three spinal segments. Disorders
affecting thoracolumbar vertebrae, sensory nerve roots, or
meninges are the most common causes of back pain.
Figure 1-28 Evaluating range
of motion of the neck to evaluate
forpain.
 Superficial sensation is evaluated by pinching the skin with a
hemostat or pricking the skin with a needle to elicit a behavioral
response indicating the sensation was perceived. Vocalizing,
trying to bite, or avoiding the stimulus is an appropriate response
to a painful stimulus. Each spinal nerve carries superficial pain
sensations from a discrete region of skin known as a dermatome.
Hyperesthesia is an increased sensitivity to stimulation resulting
in a negative behavioral reaction from the animal and is usually
located at the site of a lesion. Hypesthesia or anesthesia are
reduced or absent sensation, which may be located within three
spinal segments from the lesion. Superficial sensation is a local-
izing sharp pain carried by large fibers from the skin and is often
lost prior to deep pain in spinal cord lesions.
Y A cutaneous trunci response or panniculus response is
elicited when the dorsal skin of the trunk between T2-L4 is
pinched and a twitch of the cutaneous muscles is observed
(Figure 1-29). From the site tested, sensory nerves travel to the
spinal cord and ascend to C8-T1 where they synapse on cell
bodies of the lateral thoracic nerve. The lateral thoracic nerve
exits the spinal cord and stimulates the cutaneous trunci muscles
to contract (Figure 1-3O).A lesion anywhere along this pathway
may cause a reduction or loss of the cutaneous trunci response.
This response is used mainly to further localize lesions between
T3-L3 but can be absent on the side of a brachial plexus avulsion
(see Section 14). In normal animals, it can easily be elicited just
caudal to the shoulders and just cranial to the pelvic limb. The
cutaneous trunci response is lost only at one site in nerve root
lesions but may be completely absent caudal to the lesion with
some spinal cord lesions. The presence of this response caudal to
34
a lesion indicates that some spinal cord integrity remains even
 a  a d a  s s 
trunci response may be completely absent in polyneuropathies.

neous trunci response.

35
 Deep pain is tested by applying firm pressure to the bones of
the digits of a thoracic or pelvic limb with the fingers or a
hemostat to elicit a behavioral response (Figure 1-31). A positive
behavioral response to deep pain is consistent turning of the
head and looking, vocalizing, trying to bite the examiner, or
trying to escape when the toe is pinched. Withdrawal of the
limb is only the flexor reflex and does not mean the animal
consciously perceives the painful stimulus. If response to deep
pain appears absent from one digit, all remaining digits and the
tail should be tested to determine if there is a complete loss of
deep pain perception. Deep pain is a small-fiber, nonlocalizing
pain, which is carried in a multifocal network within the spinal
cord and is usually the last sensation that remains in spinal cord
lesions. Complete loss of the ability to feel deep pain signifies a
severe spinal cord lesion. If the deep pain sensation is absent for
a month or longer in animals with spinal cord lesions, recovery
of function is unlikely.
Figure 1-31 Testing deep pain of
a hind limb; the cat reacts to the
pain by turning or complaining.
36
Lesion Localization
Y When the neurologic examination is complete, an attempt
should be made to explain all abnormal findings by a lesion at
one anatomic site. If this cannot be done, then the animal may
have a multifocal or diffuse disease process and the differential
diagnosis should reflect this. Two separate and distinct lesion
sites from two different diseases is an unlikely scenario in clinical
neurology unless one can be explained by a history of a long-
standing problem unrelated to the current primary complaint.
Each anatomic region has specific signs, which localize lesions to
thatregion.
V Polyneuropathies are disorders that affect multiple peripheral
nerves, and polymyopathies are disorders that affect multiple
muscles. An overview of these localizing signs and consequent
alterations of gait, conscious proprioception and hopping, and
spinal cord reflexes is outlined in Table 1-4.

Definitions
Depression: Lethargy with reduced activity but no reduction in
mental ability.
Dementia: Loss of mental and intellectual abilities, memory, and
usual personality; often manifests as inability to perform trained
activities and inability to recognize the owner or other familiar
objects (Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1 Dementia in an 8-year-
old Saluki with cerebral neoplasia;
the dog did not recognize the
owner and wandered aimlessly to
the left.
Delirium: Reduced ability to pay attention to external stimuli,
disorganized thinking, disorientation, and reduced level of
consciousness; often manifests as agitation, hyperactivity, hysteria,
excessive vocalization, and inability to be calmed.
Obtundation: Decreased consciousness and behavioral responses to
mild sensory stimuli; dull, sleepy.
Stupor: Partial or nearly complete unconsciousness; animal maintains
a behavioral response to vigorous or noxious stimuli, such as pain.
Coma: Unconsciousness and an absent behavioral response to noxious
stimuli, including pain; spinal reflexes may be present or absent.
Anisocoria: Unequal pupil size.
Cheyne-Stokes respiration: Rhythmic waxing and waning of the
depth of respiration with regularly recurring periods of apnea.
Decerebrate rigidity: Marked extensor rigidity of the limbs, usually
associated with midbrain lesions; animal usually comatose.
Opisthotonus: Dorsal extension of the head, with extension of the
thoracic limbs and flexion of the pelvic limbs; often associated with
acute cerebellar lesions (decerebellate rigidity).
Meningoencephalitis: Inflammation of the meninges and brain.
42
Encephalitis: Inflammation of the brain.

V Midbrain: Dilated, unresponsive or midrange fixed, unrespon-
sive pupils; normal respiration or hyperventilation
V Pons: Miotic pupils; rapid, shallow respiration; coma is rare,
as vital center involvement leads to death
V Medulla oblongata: Miotic pupils; irregular respiration or
apnea; cranial nerve deficits (i.e., head tilt, facial paralysis,
medial strabismus, dysphagia, or tongue paralysis); coma is rare,
as vital center involvement leads to death
V Unilateral lesions at all sites will affect one pupil on the side
of the lesion and cause anisocoria (Section 6)

Diagnostic Evaluation
Important Historical Questions
 The questions in the history are asked to determine the type
and cause of the disorder. The reasons for asking the question are
discussed under each disorder but are obvious in most cases.
·Are the signs acute or chronic, nonprogressive or progres-
sive, constant or intermittent, or did they occur shortly
after birth?
● Possible trauma? If the answer is "yes," and the animal is in
critical condition, proceed with emergency management.
See Table 2-1.
· Has the animal been exposed to prescription or illegal
drugs, antifreeze, lead, ivermectin, or other toxins?
● Is the animal allowed to wander outside?
● Does the animal recognize and respond to the owner?
· Is the animal head pressing, circling, pacing compulsively,
or showing increased or reduced activity?
● Does the animal have seizures or other neurologic
abnormalities?
· Are there signs of disease in other systems, such as
vomiting, or diarrhea?
· Is there any current or past illness or neoplasia?
· Does the animal receive an all-fish, cooked-meat, or other
type of diet deficient in thiamine?
●What is the boarding or travel history (exposure to
infectious agents)?
· What recent or current medications, nutriceuticals, herbal
supplements or vaccinations has the animal been given?
Physical Examination
 Evidence of multisystemic disease, such as fever, icterus,
pallor, cyanosis, petechiae or ecchymoses, chorioretinitis,
increased lung sounds, heart murmur, abdominal or other masses,
renomegaly, alopecia, enlarged lymph nodes, or trauma, should
be thoroughly investigated.
V Bacterial meningitis can result from hematogenous spread of
infections of the endocardium, uterus, bladder, prostate, or
elsewhere in the body or directly from sinus or ear infections and
animal bites.

Emergency Management And Monitoring Of Acute Head Injury
1. Ensure animal is breathing and the airway is patent; Intubate and ventilate with oxygen
if animal is comatose and in respiratory arrest
2. Evaluate heart rate and rhythm, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, and pulse
strength; attempt resuscitation if in cardiac arrest
3. Administer oxygen by mask or flow-by nose (avoid nasal catheters as sneezing increases
4.Evaluate and monitorblood pressure,and try tokeep within normallimits
5. Place an intravenous catheter (avoid jugular vein compression, as this increases ICP)
6. Begin low-volume fluid resuscitation if needed with colloids or hypertonic saline and
crystalloids intravenously to maintain normal blood pressure and cerebral blood flow
(avoid excessive fluid volume as this may increase IcP)
7. Triage for other life-threatening situations, such as internal hemorrhage or other tho-
racic or abdominal injuries
8. Consider therapy to reduce IcP: mannitol as a bolus dose 0.25-2.0 g/kg IV over 10-
15 minutes followed in 15 minutes with furosemide, 0.7 mg/kg Iv.

10. Keep the head elevated 30 degrees above the heart to ensure venous return from
the brain
11. Monitor electrocardiogram (ECG), and treat life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias
12. Monitor body temperature (avoid overheating)
13. Initiate IV antibiotic therapy if a penetrating injury is present
14. Monitor level of consciousness, pupil size and response to light, and respiratory pattern
Neurologic Examination
V Animals with cerebral or diencephalic lesions often pace or
circle toward the side of the lesion, stand in a corner, or press
their head against the wall (Figure 2-4).
V Demented animals may appear blind, have no menace
response, and do not follow cotton balls but often avoid table
legs or walls. Demented, blind animals bump into walls and table
legs. If the pupillary light reflex is reduced or absent, an optic
nerve lesion is likely. If the pupils are normal, then the lesion is
located in the optic radiations or occipital cortex.
V Unilateral conscious proprioceptive and other postural
reaction deficits are contralateral (on the side opposite the
lesion) in cerebral, diencephalic, and rostral midbrain lesions
and ipsilateral (on the same side as the lesion) in caudal
midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata lesions.
47
V A deficit of CN 5 localizes the lesion to the pons, and deficits
of CN 6-12 localize the lesion to the medulla oblongata
(Sections l and 6).
V Evidence of neck pain may suggest meningoencephalitis or
increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to trauma,
neoplasia, or other mass lesions.

Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC); serum chemistry profile that
includes glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium,
potassium, calcium, chloride, liver enzymes (such as alanine
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, α-glutamyl trans-
ferase, and alkaline phosphatase) and cholesterol and urinalysis
can be useful to detect hypoglycemia, renal dysfunction, hepatic
dysfunction, and electrolyte abnormalities that may secondarily
affect the brain.
V Fungal hyphae associated with systemic aspergillosis may be
found on cytologic examination of the urine. Ammonium biurate
crystals may be found in the urine of animals with hepatic
encephalopathy secondary to portosystemic shunts (PSS), and
calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals may be found with
ethylene glycol intoxication.
V A fasting and 2-hour postprandial serum bile acids and blood
ammonia level are useful to evaluate liver function and are
elevated in hepatic encephalopathy.
V An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test
may demonstrate hypoadrenocorticism.
48
V Blood gas analysis is useful to detect hypoxemia, acidosis
or alkalosis.
V Coagulation and platelet function tests, including
prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, activated
clotting time, fibrin split products, mucosal bleeding time, and
platelet counts, may be indicated if a cerebrovascular disorder
is suspected.
V Thoracic radiography and abdominal radiography and ultra-
sonography may be used to evaluate liver size, examine for
portosystemic shunts, or detect neoplasia.
V Transcolonic scintigraphy or a venous portogram can be useful
to demonstrate portosystemic shunting associated with hepatic
encephalopathy
V Histologic examination of a liver biopsy may be necessary to
diagnose hepatic microvascular dysplasia or specific causes of
liverfailure.
V Ultrasonography of the brain through a persistent fontanelle
can demonstrate hydrocephalus
V Serum total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 levels are usually low
and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are often
elevated in hypothyroidism.
V When overmedication or intoxication is suspected, assays for
specific drugs and intoxicants (e.g., phenobarbital, bromide,
ethylene glycol, lead) may be performed.
V An electroencephalogram (EEG) is usually abnormal in
trauma, meningoencephalitis, hydrocephalus, cerebral neoplasia,
and severe metabolic disorders
V In comatose animals with respiratory arrest but preserved
cardiac function, brain death is indicated by the absence of elec-
trical activity on the EEG or the brainstem auditory-evoked
response (BAER) test.
V The following are tests that are performed under general anes-
thesia (unless the animal is comatose), as well as their findings:
· Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) can demonstrate hydrocephalus,
lissencephaly, focal or multifocal mass lesions, inflammatory
or degenerative lesions, edema, and hemorrhage.
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is performed following
CT or MRI if the animal does not have head trauma and
other causes of increased ICP are not suspected. The CSF
49
often has increased leukocytes and protein levels in menin
goencephalitis and increased protein levels in neoplasia.
· Brain biopsy with histologic examination of tissue collected
may provide a definitive diagnosis and characterize the
disease process.
V Serum and CSF assays for specific organisms are obtained if
meningoencephalitis is documented or an infection is suspected.
V Bacterial or fungal cultures of CSF and blood are obtained if
an infection is suspected.
Common and
Occasional Disorders
Head Trauma
 Head trauma from motor vehicle accidents, animal bites,
gunshot wounds, or malicious attacks commonly causes dementia,
stupor, or coma (Figure 2-5). Concussion is a transient loss of
consciousness without structural brain lesions. Structural lesions
occurring at the time of trauma may include tearing of brain tissue
by bony edges or penetrating injuries or hemorrhage into or around
brain parenchyma. Contusion is brain hemorrhage and edema with
disruption of nerve fibers. Stupor and coma that persists is most
likely caused by contusion. Contusion of the brain tissue can
stimulate excessive release of excitatory amino acids, which begin a
cascade of events involving intracellular calcium influx, free radical
production, cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure (ICP),

50
and cell death. Increased ICP leads to impaired cerebral blood flow
and can cause portions of the cerebral cortex to herniate under the
tentorium cerebelli and compress the midbrain, producing coma
(Figures 2-6 and 2-7). If left untreated, the cerebellum may
herniate through the foramen magnum and compress the caudal
medulla, causing death (Figures 2-6 and 2-7).

belli (single arrow) and foramen magnum (double arrows).

 As head injuries are often accompanied by trauma to other
body systems, shock, hemorrhage, and other life-threatening
problems must be rapidly identified and managed appropriately.
Movement of the neck is avoided in comatose animals as
combined head and neck injuries can occur. The emergency
management of head injuries is outlined in Table 2-1.
 Cerebral blood flow depends upon a balance between
systemic arterial blood pressure and ICP, and therapy for head
trauma revolves around maintenance of normal blood pressure
and reduction of ICP. Respiration, heart rate and rhythm, blood
gases, and blood pressure are closely monitored to avoid
hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and cerebral ischemia. Pressure on the
jugular veins, coughing, sneezing, and vomiting can all elevate
ICP and should be prevented. Colloids or hypertonic saline are
given to reduce crystalloid fluid requirements and achieve the
goals of normovolemia and normotension. ICP can be measured
directly in some specialty hospitals with a special probe that is
inserted into the brain and connected to a monitor. Mannitol
has an osmotic diuretic effect, reduces blood viscosity, improves
oxygen delivery to the brain, and is effective for lowering ICP.
Furosemide can increase the magnitude and duration of the ICP
reduction. Concerns about the effects of increasing ICP are
greater than those regarding the theoretic exacerbation of
intracranial hemorrhage with mannitol, and administration is
indicated in most patients with elevated ICP.
 The level of consciousness, pupil size, cardiac rate and
rhythm, and respiratory patterns are ideally monitored every 15
to 30 minutes for the first 4 to 6 hours in severely affected
patients. Lesions of the cerebrum or diencephalon are better
tolerated than those affecting the other parts of the brainstem.
Cheyne-Stokes respiration is associated with cerebral and dien
cephalic lesions. Hyperventilation occurs with midbrain lesions.
Rapid, shallow respiration indicates a pontine lesion and
irregular breathing or apnea occurs with lesions of the medulla
oblongata. Marked bradycardia may occur reflexively because of
hypertension, which is secondary to increased ICP (Cushing's
reflex). Examination findings in order of increasing severity are
outlined in Table 2-2.

contusion is likely and
prognosis for recovery is grave.
Opisthotonus with preserved
consciousness occurs with cerebellar
lesions (decerebellate rigidity). Loss of spinal reflexes can occur in
a comatose animal with severe brain injury due to release of
descending inhibitory pathways that suppress such reflexes. This
should be differentiated from reflex loss secondary to concurrent
spinal cord or peripheral nerve injuries. Neck or back pain may be
associated with a concurrent vertebral fracture; when such pain is
noted, vertebral radiographs should be obtained as soon as the
patient is stable (see Sections 7, 9, and 12). If the animal is
conscious, the cranial nerves can be evaluated and voluntary
movement of the limbs should be noted. If the animal is ambula
tory and there is no evidence of concurrent spinal trauma, a more
completeneurologicexamination canbeperformed(seeSection 1).
 Although plain radiographs may detect skull fractures, CT is
preferred to demonstrate fractures, acute hemorrhage or edema and
to determine the prognosis in patients with deteriorating signs.
MRI may be helpful at a later time to delineate the extent of
injury. CSF collection is avoided because of the increased risk of
brainherniation.
V In the absence of an objective measure of ICP, therapeutic
decisions must be made on the basis of serial neurologic examina.
tion, which is an insensitive evaluation of increasing ICP. If serial
neurologic evaluations reveal a decreasing level of consciousness
and dilatation of the pupils, herniation of the cerebral cortex under
the tentorium cerebelli due to increasing ICP is suspected (Figure

53
(Table 2-1). Surgery to explore the area and decompress the brain
should be considered with penetrating injuries and compressive
skull fractures and in animals with intractable elevations of ICP
Corticosteroid administration for head trauma remains a controver-
sial topic. No clinical benefit has been proven following their
administration, and in some cases, administration has been associ-
ated with a worsened outcome.

comatose animals by warm-water lavage into the external ear
midbrain are intact. BAER testing can evaluate brainstem integrity
         
tests are useful in animals with respiratory arrest but preserved
cardiac function. The absence of electrical activity on these tests
indicates brain death and a hopeless prognosis.
cerebral and diencephalic lesions and less severe lesions of the
midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata can recover completely or
become acceptable pets. Improvement may continue over 9 to 12
months. Epilepsy may appear as long as 2 years after the head
injury but can usually be controlled with anticonvulsant drug
therapy (Section 3).
Intoxication
 Many substances can cause dementia, delirium, stupor, or coma,
and a thorough history of current and recent medications and
exposure to prescription, over-the-counter, and illegal drugs and other
intoxicants should be obtained. The adverse side effects of all current
medications, nutriceuticals, and herbal supplements should be
reviewed. The ASPCA National Animal Poison Control Center
(888-426-4435) or other poison control centers can provide addi-
of some common causes of intoxication is found in Table 2-3 and
Section 3, Table 3-3. The emergency treatment of recent oral intoxi-
cation is outlined in Iable 2-4.
V If topical pesticide intoxication is suspected, the animal should be
bathed to remove any residual toxin. Assays for anticonvulsants and
certain other drugs may be performed to determine if the serum levels
are excessive so that the doses may be adjusted (Section 3). Animals
that are delirious or seizing from stimulants may have to be sedated
(Section 3). A discussion of some common neurologic toxins follows.

Emergency Treatment of Recent Oral Intoxication
· Stop seizures if present (Section 3)
● If the animal is conscious, induce vomiting with 1 ml/kg (not to excede 30 ml) of
3% hydrogen peroxide P0 or 2 ml/kg (do not exceed 15 ml) syrup of ipecac P0; do
not induce vomiting for caustic substances)
●If comatose, perform gastric lavage; intubate trachea to avoid aspiration
●Administer activated charcoal (ToxiBan; Vet-a-Mix) 2-8 g/kg PO or through tube

● Consider IV fluid therapy to promote renal excretion of the toxin
· Monitor respiration and heart rate; give ventilatory assistance, and treat cardiac
arrhythmias as needed
●Give specific antidotes and treatment when indicated
55
Y Ivermectin intoxication commonly occurs due to dosing errors
when owners treat their dogs and cats with a concentrated prepara-
tion marketed for use in sheep and cattle (Ivomec, Merial).
Although single doses of 2 mg/kg or less may be safe in most dogs,
death often occurs with doses over 8O mg/kg. The blood-brain
barrier of collies, Shetland sheepdogs, Old English sheepdogs,
Australian shepherds, and potentially other breeds appears to be
more permeable to ivermectin, and intoxication can be manifested
at off-label doses recommended for heartworm microfilaria or other
parasites. Signs of intoxication begin within 1O hours and include
dilated pupils, agitation, tremors, vocalization, delirium, blindness,
head pressing, stupor, and coma. Recent ingestion is treated as
outlined in Table 2-4. There is no specific antidote, and therapy
is mainly supportive in nature. Fluid therapy, nutritional support,
and general nursing care should all be provided. Ventilatory support
may be required in some cases. Diazepam may act synergistically
with ivermectin and should probably be avoided in these animals.
Recovery can be prolonged and may take up to several weeks in
some cases, but with adequate supportive care, most animals can
make a full recovery.
Y Pyrethrin and pyrethroid insecticides may cause depression,
hypersalivation, tremors, ataxia, and rarely seizures. Atropine
sulfate is not recommended as an antidote for pyrethrin or
pyrethroid intoxication. Organophosphate and carbamate intoxi-
cation may cause depression, but muscle tremors and seizures are
more common. This is discussed in Sections 3 and 4.
Y Ethylene glycol intoxication commonly occurs from ingestion
of antifreeze preparations and several other industrial solvents,
particularly in the fall and spring when car fluids are replaced tc
prepare for a change in seasons. One tablespoon of antifreeze can
be lethal for a cat. The brain can be directly affected by the
toxin or secondarily affected as a result of hypocalcemia, acidosis,
and acute renal failure. Vomiting frequently occurs. Neurologic
signs begin with ataxia and rapidly progress to tremors, seizures,
stupor, and coma. Renal failure follows the onset of neurologic
signs and is detectable from 24 to 96 hours after toxin ingestion.
 Hypocalcemia, azotemia, and a large anion gap are found on
the serum chemistry profile, and severe metabolic acidosis is
found on blood gas analysis. Numerous calcium oxalate monohy.
drate crystals, which are characteristic of ethylene glycol
intoxication, are often found in the urine, and should not be
confused with triple phosphate crystals (Figure 2-8). If no urine
56
is available, the crystals may be demonstrated in fluid collected
from the bladder after catheterization and instillation of a small
amount of saline. A colorimetric test for ethylene glycol is
available for testing blood or urine samples but is most accurate
if used within 24 hours of ingestion. False-positive results may
result from ingestion of propylene glycol, which is an additive in
some semimoist pet foods. Companies manufacturing antifreeze
add a substance that causes it to fluoresce under ultraviolet light
and a Wood's lamp can be used to detect staining around an
animals paws or muzzle or fluorescence in a urine sample

intoxication. Note the characteris-
tic spindle and dumbell shapes

Rose Raskin, and Perry Bain)
 If animals have been observed ingesting the toxin or ingestion is
suspected and a positive colorimetric or Wood's lamp test is obtained
before clinical signs are evident, early initiation of treatment can be
curative. In alert animals that are able to swallow, the standard
therapy for intoxication outlined in Table 2-4 can be instituted. Fluid
therapy is essential to eliminate toxins and correct dehydration or
acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate therapy may be considered in some
cases to treat severe acidosis. The treatment of choice for dogs
diagnosed within 24 hours of ingestion is IV fomepizole (Antizol.
Vet, Orphan Medical) or 4-methylpyrazole in a 20 mg/kg loading
dose, then 15 mg/kg at 12 and 24 hours and 5 mg/kg at 36 hours.
For cats treated within 3 hours of toxin ingestion, fomepizole 125
mg/kg IV initially followed by 30 mg/kg at 12, 24 and 36 hours
may be effective. Ethanol is recommended for cats (20% at 5
ml/kg IV every 6 hours for five treatments, then every 8 hours for
four treatments) or dogs (5.5 ml/kg every 4 hours for five treat-
ments, then every 6 hours for four treatments) when
4-methylpyrazole is not available. Animals receiving ethanol must
be monitored very closely and the dose adjusted if necessary to avoid
ethanol toxicosis.
57
V If the animal is in renal failure, blood dialysis is the best
option but is available at only a few select referral centers.
Peritoneal dialysis is a second option, although it is typically very
labor intensive. The prognosis is fair in animals diagnosed and
treated early in the course of the illness, but is poor if renal
failure is present unless dialysis is available.
Y Lead intoxication can occur from ingestion of lead-based
paints, putty, linoleum, roofing material, fishing weights, old
batteries, and improperly glazed ceramic dishes. Young dogs are
most commonly affected, and intoxication is rare in cats.
Anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain often occur.
Neurologic signs include dementia, blindness, chewing motions,
excessive salivation, hyperactivity, and seizures. Megaesophagus
and laryngeal paralysis from peripheral nerve involvement may
also occur (Section 6).
V A CBC may show evidence of mild regenerative anemia with
nucleated red blood cells and basophilic stippling of erythrocytes.
Blood lead assays are elevated. Occasionally, metallic substances
are noted within the gastrointestinal tract with radiography of
the abdomen and must be removed from the gastrointestinal
tract before chelation therapy with calcium EDTA or D-penicil-
lamine (Cuprimine, Merck).
 Calcium EDTA is diluted with 5% dextrose to a 1% solution
(10 mg/ml), and 25 mg/kg SQ is given every 6 hours for 5 days
then discontinued for 5 days. The process is repeated if blood
lead levels are still elevated. Oral D-penicillamine may be given
after or instead of EDTA at 10 to 30 mg/kg every 8 hours on an
empty stomach for 1 to 2 weeks. Gastrointestinal upset can occur
and may necessitate use of lower doses. Excessive use of calcium
EDTA can result in renal tubular necrosis, and adequate hydration
during therapy is essential. A newer therapy, succimer (Chemet,
Sanofi), at 10 mg/kg PO every 8 hours for 5 days then every 12
hours for 2 weeks has shown promise as a superior treatment for
lead intoxication. The prognosis is fair to good with proper therapy
in most animals.
Hypoglycemia
nerve cells, hypoglycemia results in weakness, ataxia, muscle tremors,
seizures, dementia, stupor, or coma. Prolonged hypoglycemia leads to
neuronal death and permanent brain damage. Clinical signs may be
episodic in nature. The causes of hypoglycemia in dogs and cats are
listed in Table 2-5.
58
Table 2-5
Causes of Hypoglycemia
·Inadequateglycogen storagein toy-breed dogs
(juvenile hypoglycemia)
● Insulin overdose
Insulinoma
●Excessive exercise in fasted hunting dogs
● Hepatic failure
Sepsis
● Hypoadrenocorticism
● Paraneoplastic syndrome (hepatic tumors, leiomyosarcoma)
Excessive parasitism
● Starvation (rare)
 A serum glucose level below 50 mg/dl indicates hypo-
glycemia, but levels can become normal between hypoglycemic
episodes. A sample taken after a 24 to 48-hour fast may be
necessary to document hypoglycemia. Other biochemical or CBC
abnormalities are usually present in hepatic failure, hypoadreno.
corticism, or sepsis. Elevated pre- and 2-hour postprandial bile
acids support a diagnosis of hepatic failure. An ACTH-stimula
tion test may be useful to document hypoadrenocorticism. If an
insulin-secreting tumor is suspected, the animal is fasted under
supervision until blood glucose falls below 60 mg/dl, and blood is
collected in a sodium fluoride tube for a paired plasma insulin
and glucose determination. A high-normal or elevated insulin
level (greater than 10 μU/ml) in the presence of hypoglycemia is
suggestive of an insulin-secreting tumor. An amended insulin-
glucose ratio can also be calculated (Table 2-6).
V Abdominal ultrasonography is superior to plain radiography
to
visualize insulinomas or other masses, but because of the small
size of these tumors, surgical exploration with gross examination
and palpation of the pancreas may be necessary for diagnosis.
Table 2-6
Amended Insulin-Glucose Ratio
Plasma insulin (pU/ml) X 100

Plasma glucose (mg/dl) - 30mg
Note: A ratio of greater than 30 μU/mg is suggestive of an
insulin-secreting tumor
59
Y Fifty percent dextrose 1-2 ml/kg IV diluted 1:1 in saline and
administered slowly is indicated to correct hypoglycemia in animals
with stupor or coma. Fifty percent dextrose 1-2 ml/kg PO may be
used in animals able to swallow. Owners may apply a sugar solution
(corn syrup) directly to the oral mucous membranes if signs occur at
home. In cases of juvenile hypoglycemia, exercise-induced hypo-
glycemia, or insulin overdoses, dextrose therapy alone may be
adequate. Obviously, the reasons for the decompensation or overdose
fully evaluated, especially in cats, where transient insulin resistance is
a possibility. Animals with hepatic failure, hypoadrenocorticism,
sepsis, or a paraneoplastic syndrome will require additional specific
therapy for these underlying conditions.
 Administration of dextrose to dogs with insulinomas may
temporarily alleviate clinical signs but can stimulate the tumor
to secrete more insulin, resulting in severe hypoglycemia within
a few hours. The goal in such cases should be to alleviate clinical
signs rather than attempt to normalize blood glucose. If the
response to dextrose administration is adequate, the animal
should be fed a small, high-protein meal every 4 to 6 hours.
Some animals may require a constant-rate infusion of 2.5% to
5% dextrose at 3-4 ml/kg/hr IV to control clinical signs. In
refractory cases, it may be necessary to add dexamethasone
0.5-1.0 mg/kg in the IV fluids over 6 hours or octreotide 20-40
Pg SQ every 8 to 12 hours may be necessary.
Y Surgical removal of the primary tumor and all visible metas-
tases is the treatment of choice and offers the best long-term
prognosis. When the tumor has been removed, hypoglycemia is
often at least temporarily resolved. However, many insulinomas
have metastasized at the time of diagnosis and the long-term
diagnosis may be guarded to poor. Metastatic foci may not
secrete insulin for several months.
V Long-term medical therapy consists of feeding three to six small
meals daily, limiting exercise, and administering prednisone 0.25
mg/kg/day PO. Animals refractory to prednisone and dietary therapy
may be given diazoxide (Proglycem, Baker Norton) 5-13 mg/kg PO)
every 12 hours. Serum glucose levels are monitored closely until
stable. With early diagnosis, surgical therapy, and medical manage-
ment, even dogs with metastatic insulinomas may retain a reasonable
quality of life for a year or more. The prognosis may be better for para
neoplastic processes associated with other tumors, as hypoglycemia
often resolves with complete surgical excision.
60
Hepatic Encephalopathy
 The pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy is complex
and multifactorial and remains the subject of considerable
debate. The disorder results from failure of the liver to filter
portal blood from the intestinal tract before it enters systemic
circulation. Ammonia and other toxic products from the intes-
tines enter the circulation and reach the brain, where they alter
cerebral function. Other factors, such as the formation of false
neurotransmitters and cerebral edema, may also play a role. The
causes of hepatic encephalopathy are outlined in Table 2.7.
Table 2-7
Causes of Hepatic Encephalopathy
Congenital
●Extrahepatic orintrahepatic portosystemic shunts
● Hepatic microvascular dysplasia
Acquired
●Acute hepatitis
● Chronic active hepatitis
●Hepatic lipidosis
●Toxic hepatic necrosis
●Cirrhosis
Liver neoplasia
 Congenital PSS occurs most commonly in small- and toy-breed
dogs and occasionally in cats. Larger dogs tend to have intrahepatic
PSS. Hepatic microvascular dysplasia (MVD) occurs most
commonly in Yorkshire and Cairn terriers and other small-breed
dogs. Clinical signs of PSS usually occur within the first year of life
but can be delayed until middle age. MVD often occurs later than
PSS, and many dogs remain asymptomatic for life. Acquired liver
failure may occur at any age.
V The history may reveal episodes of dementia after feeding or
signs compatible with chronic hepatic dysfunction. Acute stupor or
coma can occur. Intermittent seizure activity alone is very unusual
with hepatic encephalopathy. Many animals do not have seizures,
and if present, alterations in mentation are usually obvious. The
physical examination often shows poor growth with PSS or may
reveal abnormalities related to liver disease. Ptyalism is common in
cats, and the iris is frequently a striking copper color (Figure 2-9).
The neurologic examination may be normal or may show
dementia, stupor, coma, apparent blindness, pacing, circling, head
pressing, and ataxia.
61
Figure 2-9 A cat with copper
colored irises associated with
hepaticencephalopathy.
V The CBC typically shows microcytosis with PSS or may be
inflammatory in cases of hepatitis. Serum biochemical evaluation
may show increases in liver enzymes and decreases in BUN,
cholesterol, albumin, and glucose. Ammonium biurate crystals
are often found in the urine of animals with PSS. Pre- and post-
prandial serum bile acid assays are usually markedly elevated in
all cases with signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Blood ammonia
testing can also be useful, but sample handling is critical—the
sample should be placed into a chilled tube and separated imme-
diately after collection. Animals with MVD may not have
elevated blood ammonia.
 Abdominal radiographs typically show a small liver with PSS,
while cases with hepatitis or hepatic neoplasia may show
hepatomegaly. In hepatic MVD and other hepatopathies, liver
size can be normal. Abdominal ultrasonography can further
delineate these abnormalities, and visualization of a shunting
vessel is often possible. Transcolonic scintigraphy is useful to
document shunting of blood around the liver. CT or MRI of the
brain may show evidence of cerebral edema but are most useful
to rule-out other disease processes. The definitive diagnosis is
often made with surgery through gross visualization of abnormal
vasculature or with the aid of a portogram. Histologic examina-
tion of a liver biopsy may be necessary to make a diagnosis of
hepatic MVD or acquired acute or chronic liver failure.
 Medical therapy consists of correction of fluid and electrolyte
disturbances and reduction of absorption of toxic substances from
the intestinal tract. Hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypo.
glycemia can all exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy and must be
corrected if present. A well-balanced, low-protein, high-complex
carbohydrate diet is provided. Lactulose 0.25-0.5 ml/kg PO
62
every 8 to 12 hours can be given to dogs and cats and the dose
adjusted so that the stool is slightly soft. Lactulose is a semisyn-
thetic disaccharide that acidifies intestinal contents, alters
bacterial flora, shortens intestinal transit time, and reduces
ammonia absorption within the colon. Lactulose may be used
alone or in conjunction with oral neomycin 20 mg/kg every 8 to
12 hours, ampicillin 22 mg/kg every 8 hours, or metronidazole 7
mg/kg every 12 hours to reduce the anaerobic and urea-splitting
bacterial flora in the gastrointestinal tract.
V In comatose animals that are unable to swallow, lactulose may
be given as a retention enema. After a cleansing enema is given,
an inflated Foley catheter is inserted into the rectum and 20
ml/kg of a mixture of three parts lactulose with seven parts water
is instilled into the lower colon and left in place for 15 to 20
minutes. If lactulose is unavailable, a 1o% povodone-iodine
solution may be substituted. If cerebral edema is suspected,
administration of mannitol as a bolus dose 0.25-2.0 g/kg IV over
10 to 15 minutes followed in 15 minutes by furosemide 0.7
mg/kg IV can be considered.
Y The surgical treatment of choice for animals with congenital
PSS is partial ligation or attenuation of the anomalous vessel.
Extrahepatic PSS are easier to repair than are intrahepatic
shunts. Severe seizures and status epilepticus are uncommon
complications after partial ligation of a PSS and may require
aggressive therapy with potassium bromide or propofol or isoflurane
anesthesia (Section 3). If episodic seizures continue after surgery,
potassium bromide at 22 to 44 mg/kg PO every 12 hours is the
preferred anticonvulsant, as it is excreted by the kidneys and not
metabolized by the liver (Section 3). Specific therapy for hepatitis,
hepatic neoplasia, or intoxication should be given as needed. The
prognosis for hepatic encephalopathy varies greatly and depends on
the underlying cause and severity of the clinical signs.
Meningoencephalitis
W Meningoencephalitis or encephalitis is on the differential
diagnosis list for any dog or cat presented with dementia, compul-
sive circling or pacing, stupor, or coma as well as seizures, head tilt,
or other signs of cranial neuropathy, generalized incoordination,
and head tremors (Sections 3 through 6 and 8). Meningitis,
meningomyelitis, or myelitis can cause neck or back pain, paresis,
Or paralysis (Sections 7 through 13). The organisms that most
 cephalomyelitis, meningitis, meningomyelitis, and myelitis in dogs
and cats are listed in Table 2-8

V Although there are many infectious causes of meningoen-
cephalitis in dogs, most cases are not associated with a known
organism (Table 2-9).
 Steroid-responsive meningoencephalitis (SRME) can occur in
dogs of any breed or age and probably represents atypical or mild
cases of steroid-respons
 meningitis/arteritis (SRMA), granulo-
meningoencephalitis (NME), an immune-mediated disorder, or
an unclassified
viral infection. Beagles, Boxers, Bernese
mountain dogs, and German shorthaired pointers younger than 2
years of age are most commonly infected with SRMA, but it does
affect other 
dogs as well. Many cases of SRMA have severe neck
pain without other neurologic signs. The diagnosis, prognosis
and treatment are discussed in Section 7. NME, also known as
pug encephalitis, affects Pugs, and Maltese and Yorkshire terriers
from 2 months to 1O years
ofage.
. Neurologic signs in Pugs and
Maltese terriers are simila
primarily reflect involvement of
the cerebrum (seizures, circling, head pressing, stupor, coma),
whereas Yorkshire terriers typically have brainstem involvement.
A steroid-responsive eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis
(EME) occurs in Golden retrievers.

 Body temperature is often normal in animals with menin-
goencephalitis except in cases with systemic infections. A
cardiac murmur may be found in cases of bacterial endocarditis
that have showered bacterial emboli to the brain. Bacterial
meningitis can also result from hematogenous spread of infection
from the uterus, bladder, prostate, or elsewhere in the body or
from direct extension of bacteria from sinus or ear infections,
animal bites, and neurosurgical procedures. Chorioretinitis can
be found with many infectious agents and GME (Figure 2-10).
Figure2-10
Chorioretinitis in a dog with
distemper meningoencephalitis.
 Neurologic signs are usually multifocal in nature, and seizures,
cranial nerve deficits, postural-reaction deficits, and spinal
hyperpathia frequently accompany changes in mentation. The
CBC is usually normal, although leukocytosis may be seen with
bacterial or fungal infections and thrombocytopenia is often
noted with rickettsial disease. An elevated fibrinogen level is
often seen regardless of cause. Diagnosis rests upon the demon-
stration of inflammatory CSF, which usually consists of
elevations in both the white blood cell count and protein. In
cases of severe stupor or coma, CT or MRI is performed prior to
CSF collection, if possible, to note cerebral edema, mass lesions,
or shifts in brain tissue associated with increased ICP
 Many cases of meningoencephalitis show patchy, diffuse, or
multifocal lesions on CT or MRI, helping to distinguish them
from primary neoplasia (Figure 2-11). Occasionally, a protozoal
or fungal granuloma, GME, or abcess may appear as a mass indis-
tinguishable from neoplasia on CT and MRI (Figure 2-12).
Histologic examination of a biopsy specimen may be necessary
for a definitive diagnosis.
66

goencephalitis. Fluid is white on T2-weighted images;: note the white aqueous

 Collection of CSF from the cerebellomedullary cistern in animals
with increased ICP can lead to brain herniation (Figure 2-7) into the
low-pressure area created by CSF removal, resulting in coma, apnea,
or death. Collection of CSF from the lumbar region may be safer in
these animals, although herniation can still occur. If increased ICP is
suspected, IV mannitol as a bolus dose 0.25-2.0 g/kg is adminis-
tered over 10 to 15 minutes followed in 15 minutes with
furosemide O.7 mg/kg prior to CSF collection.
67
V The diagnosis of meningoencephalitis is suspected when
leukocytic pleocytosis (more than 6 cells/ul) is found on CSF
analysis. However, normal CSF or elevated protein alone may be
seen in cases of canine distemper virus (CDV) encephalitis,
other focal parenchymal infections, or GME that does not
communicate with the CSF. Leukocytic pleocytosis can also be
associated with trauma, intervertebral disk herniation, and
neoplasia, although meningoencephalitis is strongly suspected
when cell counts exceed 5O cells/ul. Cytologic results of CSF can
be similar for many different causes of meningoencephalitis
(Tables 2-8 and 2-9). When neutrophilic pleocytosis is present,
blood and CSF culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria or
fungi can be considered. This can be unrewarding, however, even
in cases of bacterial meningoencephalitis. As much CSF fluid as
possible should be submitted for culture, although the total
amount of CSF removed should not exceed 1 ml/5 kg of body
weight. The most common causes of neutrophilic pleocytosis are
SRMA in dogs and FIP virus in cats (Figure 2-13).
 Meningoencephalitis caused by the rabies virus is often clini-
cally indistinguishable from other viral encephalitides. The
potential for transmission to humans and invariably fatal course
dictate that unvaccinated animals with clinical signs of menin-
goencephalitis for fewer than 10 days should be handled with
caution. Protective clothing and gloves should be worn and
appropriate quarantine measures taken. Serum antibody titers are

cells in the background in a cat with meningoencephalitis associated with the
feline infectious peritonitis virus.
68
usually not elevated in unvaccinated dogs as the rapid disease
progression does not allow time to mount an antibody response.
Although no reliable premortem diagnostic test for rabies is
available, infected animals deteriorate and die within 3 to 10
days. If death occurs in a suspect animal, the brain should be
examined by the necessary public health officials. Diagnosis is
made with a fluorescent antibody test and by demonstrating
typical negri bodies on histologic examination of brain tissue.
V Serum and CSF assays are available for many infectious organisms
(Table 2-8). If antibody titers are used, immunoglobulin (Ig) G and
IgM determinations are obtained if available. Elevated IgG levels
indicate previous exposure, vaccination, or chronic infection. An
elevated IgM level suggests recent exposure or vaccination (within 3
weeks) or an active disease process. Polymerase chain reaction tests
for specific organisms may be more accurate, if available. Antibody
titers are usually higher in the serum than in the CSF, although some
organisms, notably CDV, may cause intrathecal production of
immunoglobulins, leading to higher CSF titers. In animals with
elevated CSF protein, the presence of CSF IgG may represent
compromise of the blood-brain barrier, especially when serum IgG
levels are elevated.
V Corticosteroid therapy is the usual treatment for SRME,
SRMA, GME, NME, and EME. Since many dogs have some type
of steroid-responsive meninogoencephalitis and it may take
several days to obtain the results of infectious organism assays,
corticosteroid therapy as outlined in Table 2-1O is initiated if
there is no evidence of a bacterial, fungal or protozoal infection.
Several doses of corticosteroids may even be beneficial to reduce
inflammation in patients with infectious encephalitis. Oral
trimethoprim-sulfadiazine and occasionally doxycycline may be
given for 5 to 7 days while assay results are pending. If the assays
indicate an infectious process, corticosteroid therapy is discon-
tinued and the appropriate antimicrobial therapy listed in Table
2-11 administered.
V If GME is suspected or confirmed through histologic examina-
tion of a brain biopsy, the antineoplastic drug procarbazine
(Matulene, Sigma Tau) may be given PO at 2-4 mg/kg/day for 1
week then increased to 4-6 mg/kg/day. The CBC and platelet
numbers should initially be monitored every week. If the
leukocyte count falls below 4000 cells/ul or platelets are less than
100,0o0 /ul, the drug is discontinued until the leukocyte count
returns to normal. Therapy may be needed for 6 to 12 months to
control clinical signs. Periodically withdrawing the drug may be
69
tried to test for relapse. Radiation therapy is useful for focal
lesions and can prolong survival time for more than a year in
some cases. Dogs with focal signs have significantly longer
survival times than those with multifocal signs. GME may not be
a single disease process, and some lesions have histopathologic
features suggestive of neoplasia.
V Parasite migration may be treated with prednisone 0.25-0.5
mg/kg PO every 12 hours to reduce inflammation related to
movement of the organism through the tissues.
V The prognosis for meningoencephalitis varies with the cause
and is outlined in Tables 2-8 and 2-9. Since many dogs have
SRME, the prognosis for eventual recovery is often excellent.
Table 2-10
Treatment of Meningoencephalitis in Dogs When No
Organism Can Be ldentified
·Intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solu Medrol, Pharmacia &
Upjohn) 10-15 mg/kg every 6-8 hours is given for 24 hours if the dog is severely
stuporous, comatose, or has severe seizures or other life-threatening
neurologic dysfunction
● Oral prednisone 1-2 mg/kg every 12 hours is given in milder cases or following
intravenous therapy (signs often improve in 3-5 days)
● Oral or intravenous famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours,
 Or cimetidine (Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours is given to
protect the gastrointestinal tract from the deleterious effects of the prednisone; oral
sucralfate (Carafate, Hoechst Marion Roussel) 0.25 g for cats or 0.5-1.0 g for dogs
every 8-12 hours can also be used, but it must be separated from other oral medica-
tions by several hours, as it may bind them and reduce efficacy
● Oral or intravenous trimethoprim-sulfadiazine 15 mg/kg every 12 hours is often
given while the results of infectious organism assays are awaited and is discontinued
if assay results are normal
● Oral or intravenous doxycycline (Vibramycin, Pfizer) 5 mg/kg every 12 hours may
be given while rickettsial assay results are awaited if infection with these organisms
issuspected
● Oral prednisone is continued for 3-4 weeks or until signs resolve and then reduced
by 25%-50% every 2-4 weeks until alternate-day therapy is feasible; if signs return as
the dose is reduced, the drug is increased to the original amount for a few days and
then reduced to the last effective dose; many dogs are tapered from prednisone
therapy after 3-6 months and remain free of clinical signs
●In refractory cases consider the addition of procarbazine (see text for details)

Hydrocephalus
 Hydrocephalus is dilatation of the ventricular system of the
brain and is most commonly observed as a congenital disorder in
toy breed or brachycephalic dogs younger than 1 year of age.
Hydrocephalus can also occur secondary to an acquired obstruc
tion of CSF flow by cerebral neoplasia or meningoencephalitis,
decreased CSF absorption by meningoencephalitis or trauma, and
overproduction of CSF associated with a choroid plexus tumor.
Loss of brain tissue from inflammation or degeneration adjacent
to the ventricular system results in passively enlarged ventricles.
71
/ Clinical signs are often chronic and progressive but may be
episodic or acute in nature. Such behavioral abnormalities as
dementia, aggression, compulsive circling or pacing, and diffi-
culty in training are common (Figure 2-14). Seizures may also
occur (Section 3). In cases of congenital hydrocephalus, a
persistent fontanelle, due to failure of the sutures of the skull to
close completely, and bilateral ventrolateral strabismus are often
noted. Some hydrocephalic dogs have a normally formed skull,
and some dogs with a persistent fontanelle do not have congen-
ital hydrocephalus. The gait may be normal, ataxic, or paretic,
and some animals have visual deficits. Hippus (rhythmic dilation
and constriction of the pupils) may be noted.
Figure 2-14
A kitten with dementia associated
with hydrocephalus.
V Lack of the normal gyral pattern caused by smoothing of the
inner calvarium in congenital hydrocephalus may be visible on
plain skull radiographs. Enlarged ventricles may be detected with
ultrasonography through a persistent fontanelle. Ventricular
dilatation is obvious on CT and MRI (Figure 2-15). Increased
amplitude and decreased frequency of waveforms seen on EEG
are characteristic of but not pathognomonic for hydrocephalus.
Leukocytic pleocytosis or elevations of protein may be found on
CSF evaluation if hydrocephalus is secondary to meningoen-
cephalitis or neoplasia.
 In animals with acquired hydrocephalus, the underlying cause
should be addressed accordingly. Medical therapy of congenital
hydrocephalus consists of prednisone 0.25-0.5 mg/kg PO every
12 hours for 1 week. Therapy should be tapered to the lowest
alternate-day dose able to control the neurologic signs. Response

the two eyeballs at the top of the picture).
to medical therapy is often good, and prednisone may eventually
be discontinued after several months. Anticonvulsant therapy
with oral phenobarbital 2-4 mg/kg every 12 hours or potassium
bromide 22 to 44 mg/kg every 12 hours should be provided if the
animal has seizures (Section 3). This therapy may have to be
continued indefinitely.
 Dogs with a persistent fontanelle and thin calvarium are more
susceptible to hemorrhage from head injuries, and mild trauma can
exacerbate the clinical signs. Exacerbation of the signs can also
occur spontaneously and may require the prednisone therapy to be
repeated. If severe stupor, coma, or cluster seizures occur, the
animal may be treated with IV mannitol 0.25-1.0 g/kg over 10-
15 minutes and methylprednisolone sodium succinate 10 to 15
mg/kg every 8 hours for 24 hours followed by oral prednisone.
V Surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which
drains excess CSF from a lateral ventricle into the peritoneal
cavity, may provide long-term control of hydrocephalus.
Occlusion of the shunt tubing and infection are potential
complications of this procedure. The prognosis depends mainly
on the degree of neurologic impairment, and varies widely. Some
dogs with severe ventricular dilatation only have mild behavioral
abnormalities while others can decompensate and progress to a
comatose state that is unresponsive to therapy.
73
Neoplasia
0 Brain tumors are typically seen in animals over 5 years of
age, although younger animals are occasionally affected.
Brachycephalic breeds, such as Boxers, Boston terriers, and
Bulldogs are predisposed to astrocytomas and oligoden-
drogliomas. Geriatric cats often have slow-growing meningiomas.
Clinical signs are usually chronic and progressive in nature,
although acute deteriorations-
-sometimes associated with spon-
taneous hemorrhage—can be seen. Cerebral dysfunction and
altered mentation are related both to the tumor and to the
secondary edema. Seizures are also commonly observed (Section
3), and asymmetric cranial nerve or postural-reaction deficits
may aid in localization of the lesion.
V CT or MRI usually demonstrates a mass lesion (Figure 2-16).
However, although certain tumors have characteristic imaging
appearances, it should be remembered that other causes, including
infectious disease and hemorrhage, can produce mass lesions in the
brain. Thus, definitive diagnosis may require biopsy and histologic
analysis. Ultrasonography or CT-guided biopsies of lesions may allow
definitive diagnosis so that an optimal therapeutic plan can be made.
% As discussed with meningoencephalitis, collection of CSF is risky
in patients with increased ICP, as brain herniation is possible (Figure
2-7). If increased ICP is suspected, IV mannitol as a bolus dose
0.25 to 2.0 g/kg is administered over 10 to 15 minutes followed in
15 minutes with furosemide 0.7 mg/kg prior to CSF collection.
Elevation of CSF protein without concurrent pleocytosis is typical
with neoplasia, although occasionally mild-to-marked elevations of
leukocytes in the CSF confuse the diagnosis. Several different tumors
found in dogs and cats are listed in Table 2-12.

trast T1-weighted MRl showing a
mass that is compressing the left

● Ependymoma

● Primitive neuroectodermal tumor
·Metastatic neoplasia
V Treatment of cerebral neoplasia involves combinations of
surgery, radiation therapy, :
, and chemotherapy. Although cran-
iotomy for the removal of meningioma is often very effective in
cats (Figure 2-17), this group of tumors tends to be aggressive in
dogs, and adjunctive radiation therapy is usually indicated.
Radiation therapy without excisional surgery can be considered
for some tumors. Oral lomustine is believed to slow tumor
growth and may be an option for some animals. Lomustine 60
mg/m' PO is given, and a CBC and platelet count is performed
every week for 5 weeks. If the leukocyte count is 5000 cells/μl
or above and platelets are in the normal range, then the
lomustine dose is increased to 80 mg/m'. Monitoring the CBC
and platelets continues, and treatments are repeated every 5 to 8
weeks. If the CBC and platelet counts remain stable, they are
then monitored every 1 to 3 months. Prednisone 0.25-0.5 mg/kg
PO every 12 hours can reduce secondary cerebral edema and
 relieve clinical signs for several months in some cases. New
advances in surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are
improving the prognosis for cerebral neoplasia.

tion showed it to be a meningioma, and the cat recovered completely.
75
Cerebrovascular Disorders
0 Cerebrovascular disorders (strokes) include brain infarction
or ischemia, and spontaneous hemorrhage. Although common in
humans, these disorders occur only occasionally in dogs and cats.
Thrombus formation secondary to coagulopathies, sepsis,
neoplasia, localized vasospasm, or heartworm infection can
obstruct the flow of blood to specific brain regions.
Atherosclerosis associated with hypothyroidism, idiopathic
hyperlipidemia, polycythemia, and angiocentric lymphoma are
rare causes of cerebral infarction or ischemia in small animals.
Feline ischemic encephalopathy appears to be related to
migration of the parasite Cuterebra spp. through the cerebrum in
cats. Spontaneous hemorrhage may occur secondary to hyperten-
sion, arteriovenous malformations or similar congenital
anomalies, cerebral neoplasia, vasculitis, or coagulopathies.
Seizures and other neurologic signs are often seen depending on
the brain region affected. Examination may reveal evidence of an
underlying systemic disease or asymmetric neurologic deficits.
V Acute hemorrhage is best visualized on a CT scan, although
MRI is more sensitive in detecting edema related to infarctions and
in the visualization of brainstem lesions (Figure 2-18). Blood
pressure should be evaluated to rule out hypertension. Bleeding
times and platelet counts and function tests should be evaluated for
possible coagulopathies prior to CSF collection. The underlying
etiology of a cerebrovascular accident often cannot be found. If
increased ICP is suspected, intravenous mannitol as a bolus dose
0.25-2.0 g/kg is administered over 10 to 15 minutes followed in
15 minutes with furosemide O.7 mg/kg prior to CSF collection.
CSF evaluation may reveal frank blood or erythrophagocytosis.
V Treatment should be tailored to address the underlying
disease, if one exists. Prednisone 0.25-0.5 mg/kg PO every 12
hours for 3 to 5 days with subsequent tapering may be consid
ered in such cases as animals with aberrant parasite migration.
The prognosis for cerebrovascular disorders depends on the
severity of the neurologic signs, location of the lesion, and
ability to correct underlying disease.

section of the brain showing
infarction in the right caudate
nucleus in a dog (arrow).
Hypoxia and Anoxia
8 Hypoxic and anoxic brain insults can occur secondary to
anesthetic accidents, respiratory depression from drugs or head
trauma, smoke inhalation, severe pulmonary disease, and suffoca-
tion from aspiration of vomitus or foreign bodies. Since oxygen is
necessary for proper energy metabolism of the brain, hypoxia or
anoxia leads to neuronal death and cerebrocortical necrosis.
Reperfusion and reoxygenation during resuscitation or recovery
can lead to the excessive release of excitatory amino acids and
production of free radicals, which cause further injury to the
brain. Dementia, stupor, coma, seizures, and blindness may occur.
The diagnosis is usually obvious, but tests such as pulse oximetry,
arterial blood gas analysis, and measurement of blood carboxyhe-
moglobin levels, can help to characterize the problem.
Pulmonary disease or aspiration pneumonia may be assessed with
thoracic radiographs. MRI of the brain may be useful in deter-
mining the extent of cerebral edema initially and cerebrocortical
necrosis later.
V Oxygen therapy should be administered as soon as possible
after the injury. Systemic hypotension, acidosis, and dysfunction
of other body systems are treated accordingly. The use of corti-
costeroids in this setting is controversial and has not shown clear
benefits. Newer treatments for reperfusion injury are currently
being investigated. As with head-injured animals, some animals
suffering severe brain damage can recover with time and
adequate nursing care. Recovery may continue for 9 to 12
months. In other cases, neurologic deficits, such as blindness and
      
77
Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome
V Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) may be suspected when
no cause can be found for progressive dementia in elderly dogs.
Clinical signs of CDS include a loss of training, inappropriate
urination or defecation, decreased activity and attention, altered
interactions with family members, and changes in the sleep-wake
cycle. The neurologic examination is otherwise normal. Blood
tests, urinalysis, and CSF analysis are also normal, and there are no
specific diagnostic tests for this condition. Brain atrophy with
ventricular enlargement may be found on CT or MRI.
 Selegiline hydrochloride (Anipryl, Pfizer) O.5-1.0 mg/kg PO
once daily in the morning may improve mentation. The dose should
not exceed 2.O mg/kg/day and should not be used concurrently with
tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine, amitriptyline, and
imipramine, or serotonin reuptake blockers, such as fluoxetine
(Prozac, Dista), as toxicosis and death can occur. Improvement is
typically noted within 1 month of the initiation of therapy.
Vitamin E 30 1U/kg/day not to exceed 400 1U every 12 hours is
a potent and readily available antioxidant with neuroprotective
effects and may be beneficial in CDS. Gingko biloba standardized
extract 2-4 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours is an herbal preparation
that increases cerebral blood flow, and may also be useful for
CDS. Prescription diets are available to support brain function.
Rare Causes of Stupor
and coma
Diabetes Mellitus
/ Some dogs and cats with diabetes mellitus may develop
dementia, stupor, or coma due to a hyperosmolar syndrome with or
without ketoacidosis. Concurrent clinical signs often include severe
dehydration, weakness, tachypnea, and vomiting, and an acetone
odor may be detected on the breath. Serum glucose is often
profoundly elevated (greater than 600 mg/dl). Other laboratory
abnormalities include increased serum osmolality (greater than 350
mOsm/kg), hypernatremia, prerenal azotemia, metabolic acidosis,
and glucosuria. The therapy, which consists of rehydration and
gradual reduction of blood glucose, is complex and beyond the
scope of this text. Serum electrolytes, particularly potassium and
78
phosphorus, must be monitored closely to avoid additional compli-
cations. The prognosis for most animals is fair to good with
aggressive medical therapy.
Hypothyroidism
V Myxedema coma associated with hypothyroidism occurs rarely
in dogs. Stupor or coma is accompanied by bradycardia,
hypothermia, and occasionally seizures. If pitting edema is present,
and microcytic anemia and elevated cholesterol are found on the
CBC and chemistry profile, respectively, the diagnosis may be
suspected but serum total T4, free T4, and TSH levels should be
evaluated on all dogs with stupor or coma of unknown cause.
Other complications, such as hyponatremia and hypoventilation.
can be seen. The serum total T4 or free T4 levels are very low or
undetectable, and serum TSH levels are elevated. The EEG
appears flat. Ventilatory support may be needed, and the animal
may appear to be near death. Levothyroxine sodium (Synthroid,
Knoll Pharmaceutical) 5 mg/kg IV every 12 hours is given for 1 to
2 days as soon as the diagnosis has been established.
Levothyroxine sodium is then given 0.02 mg/kg PO every 12
hours, and serum levels are monitored every 2 weeks until the
patient is stable. Additional treatment consists of correcting
hypothermia and electrolyte imbalances and general nursing care.
The prognosis is good if therapy is initiated early, and marked
improvement is usually seen within 24 hours. Thyroid replacement
therapy is often needed indefinitely.
Hyponatremia
V Low serum sodium, or hyponatremia, affects the osmotic
balance of the brain and vascular system and causes cerebral
edema. Ataxia, dementia, stupor, coma, and seizures may result.
Hyponatremia can be associated with hypoadrenocorticism,
chronic diarrhea secondary to endoparasitism, or loss of sodium-
rich fluids from severe burns or chronic effusions. A syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone is also recog-
nized after head trauma and cerebrovascular accidents.
V The diagnosis is usually straightforward after examination of a
serum biochemical profile, and levels less than 130 mEq/l are
considered dangerous. An ACTH-stimulation test may be useful
to document hypoadrenocorticism. Fecal flotation facilitates the
diagnosis of endoparasitism. CT or MRI can be considered if a
cerebrovascular accident is a possibility or to investigate the
extent of known head trauma.
79
 It is useful to consider hyponatremia in light of serum osmo
larity. Hyponatremia with a normal or increased serum
osmolality suggests that other substances, such as lipids, glucose,
protein, urea, or toxins, are attracting water into the vascular
space and diluting the sodium. Hyponatremia with hypoosmo-
larity (<280 mOsm/kg) suggests increased total body water
relative to sodium from the mechanisms listed above.
V Treatment consists of correcting the sodium deficit and treating
any underlying disease. Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can
lead to damage of the myelin sheaths of neurons (myelinolysis) and
further neurologic deterioration. Some guidelines for correction of
hyponatremia are outlined in Table 2-13.
V The prognosis for hyponatremia is good with appropriate
therapy if the underlying condition can be successfully treated.
Table 2-13
Guidelines for the Correction of Hyponatremia
● If hypovolemia is present, correct with intravenous 0.9% saline
●If hypervolemia is present, give intravenous furosemide 2-4 mg/kg
Calculate the sodium deficit as follows:
Na*deficit (mEq/l) = (140 - serum Na') x (body weight in kilograms) x 0.3
● Replace the sodium deficit over 12-24 hours using 0.9% saline or hypertonic saline
(3%-5%), if necessary (avoid rapid correction as myelinolysis and further deterioration
is possible)
· Mild cases with excessive intravascular volume may respond to cautious
water restriction
Hypernatremia
V Elevated serum sodium, or hypernatremia, adversely affects
the osmotic balance between the brain and vascular system and
causes cerebral dehydration. Cerebral hemorrhage may also occur
from damaged blood vessels due to shifts in brain tissue. Ataxia,
dementia, stupor, coma, and seizures are the most common signs,
but cranial nerve deficits may be seen secondary to hemorrhage.
Hypernatremia can be associated with decreased water intake,
diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, heat stroke, renal failure, or
rarely from the ingestion of toxic quantities of salt.
 Sodium values greater than 180 mEq/L can cause severe brain
dehydration. Elevated BUN, creatinine, or glucose on the serum
chemistry profile with isosthenuria or glucosuria supports a
diagnosis of renal failure or diabetes mellitus. Examination of
urine specific gravity in association with water deprivation and
80
possibly antidiuretic hormone administration can aid in a
diagnosis of diabetes insipidus if the animal is alert enough for
this procedure.
V If hypernatremia is chronic, correction of the sodium
imbalance is cautiously performed to avoid iatrogenic cerebral
edema. The plan for fluid replacement therapy should be consid-
ered in light of the body systems, as multiple systems are often
involved. Some guidelines for fluid replacement therapy for
hypernatremia are outlined in Table 2-14.
V If the underlying disease can be treated, appropriate correc-
tion of the hypernatremia usually results in a functional recovery.
Table 2-14
Guidelines for Fluid Replacement Therapy for Hypernatremia
If perfusion is poor, correct volume deficits rapidly with sodium-containing
crystalloids or colloids:
●Correct dehydration over 12-24 hours with lactated Ringer's sofution,0.9%saline,
or 0.45% saline
● Re-measure sodium and correct remaining extracellular water deficit with the
following formula:
Water deficit (liters) = [(New Na* - 140)/140] x (body weight in kg) x 0.6
Uremic Encephalopathy
V Uremic encephalopathy can be associated with severe acute or
chronic renal failure and azotemia. The pathogenesis is not
entirely clear, but as with hepatic encephalopathy, it may be
associated with failure to clear toxic metabolites and develop-
ment of cerebral edema. Clinical signs include depression, stupor,
coma, weakness, and seizures. The diagnosis is presumptive, and
is based on biochemical evidence of renal failure. Systemic
hypertension leading to cerebral hemorrhage may contribute to
clinical signs in some animals with chronic renal failure.
Treatment is focused on the correction of azotemia and other
concurrent problems, such as hypertension and electrolyte abnor-
malities. The prognosis is usually poor.
81
Thiamine Deficiency
V Routine feeding of well-balanced pet foods has made defi-
ciency of thiamine (vitamin Bl) a rare condition. However, this
disorder can still occur in animals fed all fish or cooked-meat
diets. Thiamine, like glucose and oxygen, is necessary for normal
energy metabolism in the brain, and deficiency leads to neuronal
necrosis and brainstem hemorrhage. Dementia, stupor, seizures,
blindness, mydriasis, dysequilibrium, and ventroflexion of the
neck may be seen. IV thiamine 10-20 mg in cats and 25-50
mg in dogs is given and then repeated SQ daily until signs
resolve. Thiamine 2 mg/kg PO once daily may be given to
supplement the diet. If therapy is initiated early, complete
recovery is usually seen.
Lysosomal Storage Disorders
V Lysosomal storage disorders result from the congenital absence
or inactivity of a specific lysosomal enzyme. The substrate
normally metabolized by that enzyme accumulates within the
cells leading to cellular death or dysfunction. Although the cells
of many body systems can be affected, neuronal cell death causes
progressive and permanent neurologic deficits. Animals are
typically younger than 1 year of age, although clinical signs may
not manifest until middle age or later in some diseases.
 Many breeds of dogs and cats are affected, and the clinical
signs vary with the specific enzyme deficit (Table 2-15). Initial
signs of dementia or aggression are most commonly associated
with GM2 gangliosidosis, fucosidosis, and ceroid lipofuscinosis.
With some disorders, connective tissue or skeletal involvement
or hepatosplenomegaly may be evident. Diagnosis of these
diseases has traditionally been difficult without necropsy and
histologic examination of the brain. However, CT and MRI
studies may show characteristic changes with some diseases,
making a presumptive diagnosis possible in an appropriate breed.
Other potential diagnostic tests are also listed in Table 2-15.
V Finding a laboratory that assays leukocytes for a specific
enzyme can be difficult, and obtaining results can be slow. Lymph
node, liver, muscle, peripheral nerve, or brain biopsy may show
accumulation of storage material within various cells, and special
histologic stains may help differentiate the type of substrate
stored. No effective therapy is currently available. The prognosis
for these diseases, because of their progressive nature, is poor.

Epidermoid, Dermoid, and
Arachnoid Cysts
V Epidermoid, dermoid, and arachnoid cysts may rarely occur in
the brain and cause neurologic signs. They are sometimes found
incidentally at necropsy. Increased availability of CT and MRI
has led to increased recognition of these structures in small
animals. Surgical removal may be successful in some cases.
Arachnoid cysts can cause progressive compression of the spinal
cord and are discussed in Section 13.
Lissencephaly
V Lissencephaly is a congenital absence of the normal gyri and sulci
of the brain (Figure 2-19). The cerebral cortex is also missing
certain cell layers and is thinner than normal. Lhasa Apsos are most
frequently affected, although lissencephaly may affect other breeds
of dog and cats. The disorder occurs in animals younger than l year
of age, and signs consist of dementia, aggression, seizures, and visual
dysfunction. The lack of gyri and sulci and thin cortex may be visu-
alized on MRI. There is no specific therapy for this condition.
Seizures may be controlled with anticonvulsant drugs (Section 3).
The prognosis is poor.

Definitions
Seizure (convulsion, ictus, fit): Clinical manifestation of excessive
and/or hypersynchronous neuronal discharges in the brain; may
manifest as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness; abnormal
motor phenomena; psychic or sensory disturbances; or autonomic
nervous system signs, such as salivation, vomiting, urination, and
defecation (Figures 3-1,3-3, 3-4, 3-5 and Table 3-1).
Figure 3-1
Seizures have many
clinical manifestations
but tonic-clonic limb
movements are common.
Epilepsy: A chronic neurologic condition characterized by
recurrent seizures.
Tonic: A sustained increase in muscle contraction lasting a few
seconds to minutes; during a seizure may result in a facial
grimace, opening of the jaws, dorsal extension of the head and
neck and extension of the limbs
Clonic: Regularly repetitive, brief, involuntary muscle contrac-
tions; during a seizure may cause facial twitching, chomping of
the jaws, and jerking movements of the neck and limbs.
Tonic-clonic: Alternating periods of tonic and clonic activity.
Atonic: Sudden reduction or loss of muscle tone.
Status epilepticus: Continuous seizure activity lasting longer
than 1O minutes or the occurrence of multiple seizures without
recovery of baseline neurologic function between episodes.
Cluster seizures: Two or more seizures occurring within a
24-hour period.
Prodrome: A behavioral phenomenon that precedes the onset of
a seizure; the animal may hide, follow the owner, or appear
restless or frightened.
Aura: A subjective sensation that marks the onset of a seizure;
difficult to recognize in veterinary medicine unless the animal
86
vomits, salivates, or inappropriately urinates or defecates imme-
diately before onset of the seizure.
Localizing sign: Asymmetric motor involvement of the face or
limbs at the onset of a seizure.
Postictal phase: Atypical behavior that immediately follows the
seizure; the animal may be restless, delirious, lethargic, confused,
blind, thirsty, hungry, inappropriately urinate or defecate; may
last from a few seconds to several hours.

Table 3-1
Types of Seizures
Generalized seizures: Abnormal electrical discharges affecting the cerebral hemispheres
bilaterally and usually causing symmetric signs (Figure 3-3).
● Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal): Bilaterally symmetric tonic-clonic
movements of the face, jaw, and limbs; the animal is unconscious (eyes may be
open), in lateral recumbency, and often salivates, urinates, and/or defecates
●Other variations of generalized motor seizures: May be exclusively tonic, clonic,
or atonic, and the animal may be fully conscious, mentally altered, or unconscious;
animal often salivates, urinates, and/or defecates
motor activity: poorly recognized in animals
Focal (partial) seizures: Abnormal electrical discharges of the neurons in a focal area of
the brain (Figure 3-4); may have asymmetric motor or sensory signs, such as twitching of
the eyelids, lips, or ears, or pawing at the face on one side; rare manifestations are episod-
ic vomiting or diarrhea; the animal may display bizarre behavior, howling, aimless running.
or circling (complex partial or psychomotorseizures or running fits)

Diagnostic Evaluation
Important Historical Questions
 The history is often the most important aspect of evaluating
an animal with seizures, as only the owner usually observes
seizure events and the neurologic examination is frequently
normal. The history is also critical to developing an appropriate
diagnostic and therapeutic plan. The following questions will
help develop a thorough history and subsequently an appropriate
therapeutic plan
· Was the first seizure within the past few weeks or months
ago? Extracranial disorders and symptomatic epilepsy may be
considered higher on the differential diagnosis list if the seizures
began recently; idiopathic and probable symptomatic epilepsy
may be more likely in an animal that has had intermittent
seizures for many months and is normal between episodes.
· How frequent are the seizures? Are there episodes of status
epilepticus or clusters? Is there a repeatable seizure pattern?
Idiopathic or probable symptomatic epilepsy usually begins with
a single seizure and then gradually becomes more frequent,
often progressing to cluster seizures or status epilepticus over
time. Many dogs with long-term seizures have a predictable pat-
tern when seizures will occur (e.g., every 4 weeks). The seizure
frequency and pattern also impact decisions regarding the initi-
ation and type of anticonvulsant therapy.
· Is there a prodrome? Describe. If the owner can be warned of
an impending seizure by consistent behavioral changes, they
might be able to abort or reduce seizure activity by administer
ing rectal, nasal, or oral anticonvulsant drugs. Occasionally,
other animals in the household sense the prodrome and can
warn the owner.
· What is the appearance of the seizure? Generalized seizures
are commonly associated with extracranial causes of seizures
and inherited epilepsy and occasionally with symptomatic and
probable symptomatic epilepsy. Focal seizures and focal seizures
that secondarily generalize are associated with an intracranial
disorder like symptomatic or probable symptomatic epilepsy.
Focal seizures that begin in the facial muscles and then general.
ize with little motor movement are more common in cats than
in dogs.
92
· Is a videotape of the seizures available or can the owner
obtain one? A videotape of the episodes can be helpful to dif.
ferentiate seizures from other disorders and to determine
whether the seizures are symmetric or asymmetric.
· How long are the seizures? Most seizures last a few seconds
or minutes; focal seizures may be brief but can occur in clusters.
· Is there a postictal phase? Describe. Identification of a pos-
tictal phase can be important to confirm seizures, as such activi
ty is not seen with syncope, narcolepsy, or rapid-eye-movement
(REM) behavior disorder. In rare instances, the animal may
have to be sedated because of prolonged hyperactivity during
the postictal phase and occasionally may become aggressive.
Such animals should not be handled until this phase resolves.
· Is the animal normal between the seizures? If the animal's
behavior is abnormal between well-spaced seizure events, then
seizures from extracranial disorders or symptomatic epilepsy is
more likely.
· Are the seizures associated with sleeping, feeding, fasting,
exercise or stressful situations? Some dogs with idiopathic
epilepsy or probable symptomatic epilepsy may seize while
sleeping but cannot be awakened like animals with REM
behavior disorder. Seizures following feeding may be associated
with hepatic dysfunction. Seizures during fasting, exercise, or
stress may be associated with hypoglycemia. Stressful situations
may precipitate seizures in a few dogs with idiopathic or proba
ble symptomatic epilepsy.
· Do seizures occur after application of pesticides to the animal
or environment? Some epileptic animals will have seizures after
exposure to topical or environmental pesticides that do not
adversely affect normal animals. The owner should be questioned
regarding a relationship between seizures and house or yard spray-
ing or administration of medications for parasite control.
· Has there been exposure to other drugs or toxins?
Intoxication is a common cause of seizures, and exposure to
prescription, over-the counter, illegal drugs, nutriceuticals, and
herbal preparations should be questioned. Insulin overdose in
diabetic animals frequently causes seizures and altered menta-
tion. Some ceramic products (dishes and bowls), fishing
weights, older paint, caulking compounds, golf balls, and other
products contain lead that can be toxic to animals. Animals
that roam freely may have access to ethylene glycol (antifreeze)
especially in the spring and fall.
93
· What is the pet's vaccination status? Incompletely vaccinat
ed animals can have seizures associated with the canine distem
per or rabies viruses; animals incompletely vaccinated for rabies
that are exposed to wildlife should be handled with appropriate
precaution, including use of protective gloves and clothing,
quarantine, and limited human contact.
· Has there been a recent or past illness or neoplasia? As
with the history in other problems, questions regarding recent
or past lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, sneez-
ing, polyuria/polydipsia, or polyphagia are asked to find evi-
dence that might indicate extracranial disorders or symptomatic
epilepsy associated with a systemic infection or neoplasia.
· Was there a recent or past head injury? Seizures may occur
at the time of a head injury or up to 2 years later from residual
brain scarring.
· Is there a familial history of seizures? If the parents, sib.
lings, or other relatives have epilepsy, an inherited problem
should be suspected
● What is the diet? Although rare, thiamine deficiency can
cause seizures in dogs and cats. Inadequate nutrition leading to
hypoglycemia can cause seizures in toy-breed dogs.
· What previous medications or treatments have been given
for seizures? Current anticonvulsant medications or other ther.
apies and their effectiveness should be documented to help
develop an effective strategy for long-term seizure management
if necessary.
· How frequent can the client administer medications? The
ability of a client to medicate and provide long-term manage-
ment of an animal with seizures should be discussed, as mainte
nance anticonvulsant drugs may have to be given every 8 to 12
hours for the life of the animal.
Warning: Some topical products for flea and tick control considered
safe in normal animals may precipitate status epilepticus and death in
epileptic dogs and cats.
94
Physical and Neurologic
Examinations
V Auscultate the chest for evidence of murmurs, arrhythmias, or
abnormal lung sounds
V Evaluate body temperature, mucous membrane color, lymph
node size, and note evidence of systemic illness.
V Carefully palpate the abdomen for evidence of neoplasia.
V Examine the retina for evidence of chorioretinitis indicating
systemic infections or granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME).
V A thorough neurologic examination is essential to detect
abnormalities other than seizures. The animal may be demented
or stuporous shortly after the seizure or as a result of anticonvul
sant therapy. The neurologic examination should be repeated
after recovery from the seizure. Animals with asymmetric neuro.
logic abnormalities most likely have symptomatic or probable
symptomatic epilepsy.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
Diagnostic plans for specific types of seizures are shown in
Figure 3-6. An algorithm of seizures, diagnostic tests, and
diagnosis is shown in Figure 3-7.
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis are useful to identify extracranial causes of seizures and
are often part of the preanesthetic evaluation.
V A leukocytosis or leukopenia may be apparent on the CBC in
cases of systemic infection, but it is often normal with meningoen-
cephalitis. Polycythemia is obvious on examination of the CBC.
V Hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, other electrolyte abnormalities,
elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction may be found on
the serum chemistry profile and may be associated with seizures
or anticonvulsant therapy.
V Urinalysis may detect renal insufficiency or failure, calcium
oxalate crystals associated with ethylene glycol intoxication, or
V Pre- and post-prandial serum bile acids or blood ammonia
assays are useful to detect liver dysfunction.
V If organophosphate or lead intoxication is suspected, measure-
ment of serum cholinesterase and blood lead levels might be useful.

V A colorimetric test for ethylene glycol intoxication is
available for testing blood or urine samples, but this test is most
accurate if used within 24 hours after ingestion of the toxin.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiography and abdominal ultrasonog-
raphy can be performed to evaluate the liver and kidneys or to
detect primary or metastatic neoplasia or cardiopulmonary disease.
V Ultrasonography of the brain may be useful in some hydro.
cephalic animals
V A cardiac event recorder or a Holter monitor may detect
arrhythmias associated with syncope.
V Transcolonic scintigraphy may be useful to detect a portosys-
temic shunt in animals with hepatic encephalopathy.
V Electroencephalography (EEG) may be diffusely abnormal in
extracranial seizure disorders and symptomatic or probable symp-
tomatic epilepsy but is often normal in other animals with
probable symptomatic and idiopathic epilepsy. Interictal parox-
ysmal spikes may be seen on EEG in animals with epilepsy that is
poorly controlled with anticonvulsant drugs.
V The following are tests that are performed under general anes-
thesia, as well as their potential findings:
· Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) should be considered in any animal with recurrent
seizures. CI or MRl is recommended in animals with interictal
neurologic deficits, focal seizures, seizures refractory to drug
therapy, or seizures that begin at less than 1 or greater than 5
years of age.
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis will help to rule in or rule
out symptomatic epilepsy.
● Histologic examination of a brain biopsy specimen may pro-
vide a definitive diagnosis and characterize the disease process.
V Bacterial or fungal culture of CSF and blood and serum and
CSF assays for specific organisms are also obtained if an infec-
tious process is suspected.

Seizure Disorders
 Head trauma, meningoencephalitis, hydrocephalus, cere-
brovascular disorders, cerebral neoplasia, lysosomal storage
disorders, and lissencephaly commonly cause seizures and are
epsy.
 The seizures and the under
lying cause must be treated if possible. Seizures associated with
extracranial disorders, such as intoxication, hypoglycemia,
hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, electrolyte disturbances,
thiamine deficiency, and polycythemia, must also be treated
along with the underlying cause (Figure 3-8). The causes of
hypoglycemia are discussed in Section 2, and outlined in Table
2-5. The causes of hepatic encephalopathy are outlined in Table
2-7. An overview of some common toxicants that cause seizures
is found in Table 3-3. Many toxicants cause ataxia, tremors,
stupor, and coma. When in doubt about a substance, the ASPCA
National Animal Poison Control Center (888-426-4435) or
other poison control centers can offer assistance. Many extracra-
nial disorders and disorders that cause symptomatic epilepsy also
cause dementia, stupor, or coma. The diagnosis, treatment, and
prognosis are discussed in Section 2. Hypocalcemia can cause
seizures but often produces tremors and is discussed in Section 4.

Probable Symptomatic Epilepsy
V Animals often have seizures that continue after recovery from
a previous head injury, encephalitis, controlled hypoglycemia,
surgically excised neoplasia, or surgically corrected extrahepatic
portosystemic shunts. In some cases, the seizures may begin up to
2 years after these disorders. Other animals have seizures of no
known cause, and inherited epilepsy is not considered likely.
These cases are called probable symptomatic epilepsy and
residual brain damage from a known or unknown previous
process is suspected. Seizures are usually focal or focal with
secondary generalization but can also be generalized.
V Video documentation of asymmetry during the seizure is
important for dog breeders who are concerned about idiopathic
(inherited) epilepsy if the physical and neurologic examinations
and all diagnostic tests are normal. Some animals with probable
symptomatic epilepsy have asymmetric hopping or conscious
proprioceptive deficits or other focal neurologic deficits. There
may be focal abnormalities on the EEG, but CT, MRI and CSF
analysis are normal and differentiates it from symptomatic
epilepsy. Although probable symptomatic epilepsy may be difficult
to differentiate from idiopathic epilepsy, they both have identical
therapies that revolve around control of the seizures.
Idiopathic Epilepsy
 Idiopathic (inherited) epilepsy has been documented in
Beagles, German shepherds, Belgian tervurens, Keeshonds, and
Dachshunds and is suspected in Saint Bernards, Australian
shepherds, Labrador retrievers, Golden retrievers, Irish setters,
standard poodles, springer spaniels, cocker spaniels, Lhasa apsos,
border collies, and many other purebred dogs (Figure 3-9).
Idiopathic epilepsy has not yet been documented in cats.
Generalized seizures with loss of consciousness are most common
and usually begin between 1 to 3 years of age, but a few dogs
begin seizures between 6 months and 1 year or 3 to 7 years of
age. The onset of seizures is almost always insidious, beginning
with a seizure every few weeks or months but then becoming
progressively more frequent. Many dogs eventually develop
cluster seizures or status epilepticus. In rare cases, this may be the
first known seizure activity. German shepherds, Australian
shepherds, Belgian tervurens, springer spaniels, Labrador
retrievers, and Saint Bernards are prone to cluster seizures.
101
Figure 3-9 ldiopathic epilepsy
Occurs in German shepherds and is
suspected to occur in many other
breeds of dogs.
V The diagnosis is suspected in a purebred dog with generalized
seizures and normal findings on the physical and neurologic
examinations between seizures and all diagnostic tests including
MRI and CSF analysis. Breeding trials may be needed to confirm
the diagnosis if no other dogs in the lineage have had seizures.
Unless animals are presented with severe cluster seizures or status
epilepticus, therapy is aimed at controlling the seizures with
maintenance anticonvulsant therapy.
Status Epilepticus
Therapy
% Status epilepticus can occur regardless of the cause of
seizures and is often precipitated by reduction or discontinuation
of maintenance anticonvulsant drug therapy or if serum levels of
the drug are affected by a drug interaction. Seizures that last
longer than 10 minutes or occur in close succession should be
considered a medical emergency. Hypoxia, hypoglycemia, hyper-
tension, tachycardia, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, and
hyperthermia associated with seizures can lead to irreversible
brain damage or death. Renal failure may develop as a result of
rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria secondary to prolonged
muscle activity. The treatment of status epilepticus is outlined in
Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6.
Y While one person is administering treatment to control the
seizures, a second person can provide the supportive emergency
monitoring and management of status epilepticus listed in Table 3-6.
102
Table 3-4
Stop the Seizures!
Drugs for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus
1. If hypoglycemia is suspected in a juvenile toy breed dog or diabetic animal receiving
insulin, administer 50% dextrose 1-2 ml/kg IV diluted 1:1 in saline slowly over several
minutes. Oral 50% dextrose 1-2 ml/kg may be used if a vein is not accessible
cats will often stop the seizures. This dose can be repeated twice within a 15-minute peri-
od if seizures continue or recur. The anticonvulsant effectlasts 15-30 minutes. Injectable
diazepam solution may be administered intranasally at a dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg or rectally
0.5-2.0 mg/kg if a vein is not accessible. Intranasal and rectal absorption are relatively
quick and are preferable to subcutaneous, intramuscular, or oral routes.
3. Diazepam constant-rate infusion (CRl) (Table 3-5) can be used in animals that are
refractory to single injections or as an adjunct for longer-term control. Diazepam CRl
is particularly useful in dogs having severe cluster seizures but not actively seizing
on admission.
4. Pentobarbital sodium 3-15 mg/kg IV is given slowly to effect until seizures are con-
trolled if single injections of diazepam are ineffective, diazepam CRl is unavailable, or rapid
out significant anticonvulsant properties, but it controls the physical manifestations of
recovering from pentobarbital often paddle: This is not due to seizure activity and more
pentobarbitalisnotneeded.
5. Animals already receiving oral phenobarbital must continue to receive it at the
regular dose and dosing interval; it may be administered intramuscularly or intravenous-
ly if the animal cannot swallow. Oral anticonvulsants should be used as soon as the
animal is able to swallow.
6. Animals not currently receiving oral phenobarbital therapy may receive a loading dose
of phenobarbital 4-5 mg/kg IV every 30 minutes for four doses to achieve rapid blood lev
els, and dosing should be continued at 2.5 mg/kg every 12 hours. Phenobarbital is usually
administered concurrently with diazepam to provide a more sustained anticonvulsant
that have a history of recurrent episodes of status epilepticus. Phenobarbital blood levels
should be monitored and should not exceed 35 μg/ml.
7. lf status epilepticus is refractory to the above treatments, one of the following can be
tried, although respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure must be closely monitored:
●Isoflurane inhalation anesthesia may be used but necessitates ventilation and
may cause seizures
103
Table 3-5
Constant-Rate Infusion Diazepam
1. Administer diazepam as an IV constant-rate infusion (Figure 3-10) at a dose of
0.1-2 mg/kg/hr if seizures are not controlled by single injections. Start at the low end
of the range and gradually increase the dose as needed to control the seizures. Most
animals respond to 0.25 mg/kg/hr or less
2. Diazepam can be irritating; a central vein is preferred; avoid the jugular vein if
increased intracranial pressure is a concern.
3. Administer with a syringe pump (Figure 3-10) or dilute with 0.9% NaCl or 5% dex-
trose in a small IV bag or buretrol system.
4. Diazepam is degraded by light and bound by plastic. Run a small amount of the
solution through the tu bing before administration and prepare only 2-4 hours worth of
solution at a time. Cover the line with light resistant brown plastic or aluminum foil.
5. A reasonable goal is to maintain a seizure-free state for 12 hours before attempting
to wean the animal from the diazepam. At this time, the infusion rate can be halved
every 4-6 hours and then discontinued. If seizures recur, the rate is increased to the
previouslevel andreduced later.

Monitoring and Further Treatment for Status Epilepticus
● Monitor respiration. Apnea may occur during a seizure but is usually transient.
Neurogenic pulmonary edema is a possible sequel of seizures and may necessitate
oxygen therapy.In severe cases,animals mayhave tobe maintained ona ventilator.
Decisions should ideally be based on the results of arterial blood gas analysis.
● Monitor cardiac rate and rhythm. Tachycardia is common during a seizure but
the heart rate returns to normal once the seizure has stopped. Bradycardia may result
from the medications needed to control the seizures. Bradycardia below 40
beats/minute may have to be treated with atropine sulfate 0.02-0.04 mg/kg or gly
copyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg SQ or IV
usually resolves once the seizure has stopped. If body temperature rises above
106F, ice packs or cool (not ice cold) water and a fan may be used to bring it
down. The temperature should be monitored and cooling stopped at 38.9? C (102
F)topreventhypothermia
● Insert an intravenous catheter for fluid and drug administration. Maintenance
fluid therapy should be given in animals unable to drink. Fluid therapy may be
increased if the blood pressure is low or myoglobinuria occurs.
resolve once the seizure is stopped. Hypotension may occur from anticonvulsant drug
therapy but often improves with intravenous fluid therapy and control of bradycardia.
Isotonic saline, with potassium chloride supplementation, may be initiated at a main-
tenance rate of 2 ml/kg/hr.
●Monitor serum glucose. In animals suspected to have hypoglycemia as the cause
of their seizures, obtain a serum sample prior to administration of dextrose if possi
ble. Hyperglycemia commonly occurs during seizures due to the release of glycogen
stores from the liver. Hyperglycemia resolves once the seizures are stopped and
should not be treated with insulin. Fifty percent dextrose 1-2 ml/kg IV diluted 1:1 in
saline and administered slowly over 5-10 minutes will correct hypoglycemia if present.
unclear whether hypoglycemia is the cause or result of the seizures
●Monitor arterial blood gases. Marked respiratory acidosis then metabolic acidosis
can occur during prolonged seizures. Once the seizures are controlled, metabolic aci-
dosis shouldresolve without treatment.
·Monitorurine for discoloration.Myoglobinuria can cause kidney damage.Reddish
brown urine may be associated with myoglobinuria and intravenous fluids should be
increased to 2-3 times maintenance rates to protect the kidneys from damage.
·Prolonged seizures can result in cerebral edema. Oxygen therapy will reduce
minutes later can be useful to treat cerebral edema.
● Initiate therapy for the underlying disease process if possible.
● Monitor recovery from sedation. Paddling of the limbs is common during
recovery. Such activity can be differentiated from seizures as seizures usually have
tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic limb movements
105
Maintenance
Anticonvulsant Therapy
 When seizures recur more than once a month, occur in
clusters, or last more than 5 minutes, anticonvulsant therapy is
 ia o   ss  
ture, herbal therapy, homeopathic remedies, or other alternative
therapies. Other animals require one or more anticonvulsant
drugs. The most common anticonvulsant drugs used in dogs are
phenobarbital and potassium bromide (KBr). Phenobarbital and
in some cases diazepam are used for cats. A guide to the use of
oral anticonvulsant therapy for epileptic dogs is found in
Table 3-7. Oral diazepam is not an effective anticonvulsant in
dogs and has been associated with a rare idiosyncratic hepatotox-
icity in some cats.
Phenobarbital
V Oral phenobarbital often controls seizures within 72 hours. If
seizures are not controlled within 7 days, the dosage can be increased.
Although 5 mg/kg every 12 hours is the highest suggested phenobar-
bital dose, some small dogs need 8 mg/kg every 12 hours to reach
therapeutic serum levels. Phenobarbital elixir 3 mg/ml may be the
easiest way to make small adjustments in the dose for small dogs and
cats, although 8-mg phenobarbital tablets are also available. A serum
phenobarbital level should be evaluated after the animal has received
a consistent dose for 2 weeks to ensure that it does not exceed 35
pg/ml, as hepatotoxicity can occur.
V Sedation, ataxia, polyuria/polydipsia, and polyphagia are
common side effects of phenobarbital and may necessitate dosage
reduction or change to another anticonvulsant. Phenobarbital
occasionally causes hyperactivity in dogs and cats, and this may
be alleviated by replacing the phenobarbital with mephobarbital
(a related drug) at the same dose. Some animals become tolerant
to phenobarbital after a few months, and the dose must be
increased to maintain the same effective serum level. Alterations
of the dose are best made in conjunction with an evaluation of
the current serum phenobarbital level.
 As hepatotoxicity can occur in dogs on phenobarbital, liver
function should be monitored with pre- and post-prandial bile acids
every 3 to 6 months for the first year of therapy. Serum alkaline
phosphate and alanine aminotransferase levels may be elevated due
106
Table 3-7
A Guide to the Use of Oral Anticonvulsant Therapy for
Idiopathic or Probable Symptomatic Epilepsy in Dogs
1. Evaluate seizure frequency
· If seizures occur once a month or less, may try acupuncture alone or other alter-
native therapy or KBr 22 mg/kg P0 every 12 hours.
· If seizures occur multiple times a month, begin phenobarbital 2-4 mg/kg PO
every 12 hours. Control of seizures can occur within a few days. If seizures contin
ue at the same frequency after 7 days, increase the dose of phenobarbital by 10%
· If cluster seizures occur, begin phenobarbital 2-4 mg/kg PO every 12 hours com-
bined with KBr 22 mg/kg every 12 hours. Cluster seizures are rarely controlled by
phenobarbital alone
serum phenobarbital level (2-4 hours after oral phenobarbital is given)
·If the serum phenobarbital level is below 20 μg/ml increase the phenobarbital
increases of dosage and monitoring serum phenobarbital levels until the serum
level is between 30-35 μg/ml or the seizures are controlled at a lower level
· If the serum phenobarbital level is 30-35 μg/ml and the animal is not on KBR,
begin KBr at a dose of 22 mg/kg every 12 hours.
·If the serum phenobarbital level is greater than 35 μg/ml, liver damage may
occur, so decrease the dosage by 10% every 10-14 days until a serum level of 30-
35 μg/ml is obtained.
3. If the seizures are controlled and the animal is sedated or ataxic on the com
bined drug regimen, reduce the phenobarbital dose by 10% every 7 days as needed
until sedationresolves.
4. If seizures continue,increase the KBr dose by 10% every 7 days until the seizures
are controlled; if sedation develops, keep the KBr dose constant and reduce the pheno-
barbital by 10% every 7 days until sedation resolves.
5. Measure serum bromide levels in 3-4 months. In dogs with poorly controlled clus-
ter seizures, the serum level may have to be 40o0-50o0 μg/ml before control is
achieved. (Most laboratories will report toxic levels). Chloride level will be elevated on a
serum chemistry profile (most tests measure bromide ions as chloride)
seizing. consider a diagnosis of active intracranial or extracranial disease or refractory
epilepsy. Assistance from a specialist may be required.
7. Adding acupuncture at any phase may assist seizure control
107
to enzyme induction, but liver function should remain normal.
Hepatotoxicity has not been documented in cats. Idiosyncratic
cutaneous hypersensitivities and blood dyscrasias rarely occur. Once
seizures are controlled and liver function appears normal, yearly
evaluation of the serum phenobarbital level, serum chemistry
profile, pre- and post-prandial bile acids measurement, and a CBC
should be done. Any dramatic change in results from one year to
the next may signal potential intoxication.
 Phenobarbital should never be abruptly discontinued as
status epilepticus may result. Phenothiazines, narcotics, antihist-
amines, other CNS depressant drugs, valproic acid, and
chloramphenicol may increase the effects of phenobarbital and
cause severe sedation and respiratory depression. Phenobarbital
may decrease the effect of chloramphenicol, doxycycline,
metronidazole, theophylline, corticosteroids, B-blockers, and
quinidine. Any drug considered for a dog or cat on phenobarbital
therapy should be reviewed for potential drug interactions.
Potassium Bromide
V Oral KBr can be the first line of therapy for some dogs (22mg/kg
PO every 12 hours), but it may cause inflammatory lung disease in
cats and should only be used in this species if liver function is
abnormal or if phenobarbital is ineffective. The KBr dose for cats is
15 mg/kg every 12 hours or 30 mg/kg/day. KBr is not metabolized
by the liver but is excreted by the kidneys. It must be given with a
meal to avoid vomiting from gastrointestinal irritation—dividing
the daily dose into two separated doses may result in better
tolerance. Because KBr is excreted in the kidneys, it should be used
with caution and at reduced doses in animals with renal insuffi-
ciency.
V KBr is not commercially available and must be made by a
compounding pharmacist. KBr crystals readily dissolve in water
and can be prepared in any strength, although 250 mg/ml is the
most common. The crystals can also be placed in gelatin
capsules, but this is not recommended initially because the liquid
form of KBr allows for easy dosage adjustments. The owner
should wear gloves to avoid skin absorption and place the recom-
mended dose on a piece of bread or small amount of food that
the animal will completely eat to ensure that the correct amount
is given. Liquid KBr placed directly into the mouth may end up
on the owner or the floor, and the correct dose may not be given.
Some animals dislike the taste and refuse the drug even in food.
KBr can be compounded into corn syrup or chicken stock, which
is often readily consumed even by finicky eaters.
108
% The chloride content of the diet may alter the concentration
of KBr in the blood, and the diet should be kept as consistent as
possible. A change to salty food or snacks containing high levels
of sodium chloride may reduce KBr levels, and seizures may
result. Changing the diet may necessitate altering the KBr dose
to maintain the serum bromide at effective levels. If renal disease
develops, KBr intoxication may occur.
V For frequent cluster seizures, KBr may initially be combined
with phenobarbital 1-2 mg/kg PO every 12 hours, as KBr may
not be effective for several weeks. When KBr begins to take
effect, animals often become sedated, at which time the pheno-
barbital dose can be reduced by 10 % every 7 days until sedation
resolves. The phenobarbital dose may be reduced gradually over
the months that follow and then discontinued if the seizures
remain controlled. Serum KBr levels may be evaluated in 3 to 4
months when they reach a steady state.
 KBr should never be abruptly discontinued unless in acute
respiratory distress of cats as status epilepticus may be precipi-
tated. The KBr dose may have to be increased to as much as 50
mg/kg every 12 hours to achieve a therapeutic serum bromide
concentration. Dose adjustments are best made in conjunction
with evaluation of serum levels.
% KBr may cause inflammatory lung disease in cats after a
month or more of therapy, and the dose should be tapered and
the drug discontinued.
V Under special circumstances when seizures cannot be
controlled by other means and the patient can be closely
monitored, a loading dose of KBr 25 mg/kg every 6 hours may be
given over a 5-day period to rapidly increase the serum bromide
concentration. As KBr intoxication can cause acute pancreatitis,
severe sedation, and death, this technique is not recommended
for routine use. If sedation and ataxia develop, the drug is
reduced to 22 mg/kg every 12 hours. KBr loading doses should
never be given to animals with renal disease.
Y Polyphagia may occur in some dogs on KBr therapy. A low.
calorie diet may have to be instituted to prevent excessive
weight gain. If the sodium chloride content differs from the
regular diet, the dose of KBr may have to be adjusted to maintain
therapeutic levels. Polydipsia/polyuria can occur with KBr
therapy but is less common than with phenobarbital therapy.
Cutaneous reactions have been observed in some dogs, especially
those with a history of dermatitis. Personality changes, such as
109
sedation, irritability, constantly seeking attention, and aimless
wandering or pacing, may also occur. KBr may cause pelvic limb
stiffness which disappears when the KBr dose is reduced. The adverse
effects of KBr are reversible once the dosage is reduced and KBr is
generally a very safe drug. When the seizures are controlled, the
serum bromide levels, CBC, and serum chemistry should be evaluated
annually. Serum chloride levels will appear falsely elevated as most
chemistry analyzers mistake the bromide ion for chloride.
Monitoring Therapy
V As with any therapeutic drug monitoring, serum samples should be
collected in a plain glass tube (red top). Serum separator tubes, which
contain silicon, should be avoided because silicon may bind drugs and
falsely lower the reported level. In most cases, the serum level of the
phenobarbital and KBr do not vary significantly over a 12-hour period
once a steady state is achieved, and the serum sample can be collected
at any time. In animals whose seizures are difficult to control, peak (2
hours after the pill) and trough (8 to 12 hours after the pill) measure-
ment of serum phenobarbital levels may be useful to detect cases of
rapid metabolism. Such animals may benefit from administration
every 8 hours. Serum anticonvulsant drugs are monitored for the
reasons outlined in Table 3-8.
Y Most laboratories report serum phenobarbital concentrations of
15 to 45 μg/ml as therapeutic, although this is highly variable
between individual animals. Some animals may require high levels of
phenobarbital for seizure control. However, the risk of hepatotoxicity
increases when the serum phenobarbital level exceeds 35 μg/ml.
Serum levels of KBr of 1000-5000 μg/ml (1000-5000 mg/dl or
1-5 mg/ml) are considered therapeutic. The units of measurement
for KBr levels in serum vary from laboratory to laboratory and can be
confusing. Many laboratories will indicate that levels over 2000 mg/ml
 are toxic, which is not the case for dogs.
Table 3-8
Reasons to Monitor Serum Levels of Anticonvulsant Drugs
When seizures are controlled:
● To determine the effective therapeutic level for an individual animal
●To ensure drug levels are below hepatotoxic ranges
If seizures are not controlled:
● To determine if an increased dose or different anticonvulsant is needed
● To determine what changes need to be made if the animal becomes sedated,
ataxic, or ill from liver or kidney disease or if it has begun a new drug therapy or diet
110
Y Maintenance anticonvulsant drugs may have to be continued
for years and often for the rest of the animal's life. In some cases,
the medications may be reduced after the animal has been free of
seizures for 1 year and then slowly tapered over the following
several months. The ultimate goal is to reduce the frequency and
severity of the seizures with doses of medication that produce
minimal side effects and are unlikely to result in toxicity. The
animal may still have a few seizures a year. Advice to owners of
epileptic dogs is outlined in Table 3.9.

Epileptic Dogs on Anticonvulsant Therapy

mental stress; ensure plenty of rest; and maintain a regular routine.
●Avoid changes in diet or salty snacks in pets receiving KBr.
· Avoid pesticides on the animal and in the environment if possible; if not, closely
●If cluster seizures occur in relation to the monthly heartworm prevention treatment
● Avoid acepromazine for travel or sedation as it may induce seizures
● Do not give any other medications without the advice of a veterinarian, as drug
interactionscan occur.
●Avoid situations that seem to trigger seizures; if such situations cannot be avoided,
the event.
●Cnce seizures are controlled, yearly evaluation of the serum anticonvulsant levels,
serum chemistry profile, measurement of pre- and post-prandial bile acids, and CBC
should be performed.
●Most animals with epilepsy can lead a long and healthy life.
Diazepam
 Although intravenous diazepam is effective to control status
epilepticus in dogs, it undergoes rapid and extensive hepatic
metabolism once in the circulation and has a very short half-life.
In addition, dogs build up a tolerance to the anticonvulsant
effects of diazepam in 1 to 2 weeks, and it is therefore not a
useful oral anticonvulsant for this species. The half-life of
diazepam in cats is nearly 2o hours and therefore it may be used
as an oral anticonvulsant in this species at a dose of 0.25-2
mg/kg every 12 hours. The dose may be increased by 1-mg incre-
ments if needed in order to control seizures and avoid sedation.
Polyphagia and sedation are common side effects.
111
 Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity can occur in cats and therefore
diazepam is typically used only if phenobarbital is not effective
for seizure control. Acute fulminant hepatic necrosis has been
seen in cats as early as 5 days after beginning oral diazepam, and
therefore liver enzymes should be evaluated every 5 to 7 days
initially. Diazepam should be discontinued if liver enzyme eleva-
tions are detected or if clinical signs of hepatic disease become
evident. Abrupt withdrawal of diazepam following prolonged
treatment can cause seizures or signs of withdrawal, such as
tremors, anorexia, and weight loss.
Adding a Second Drug
V Although the use of one drug is effective in many animals, a
significant proportion of dogs with idiopathic or probable symp-
tomatic epilepsy require additional medication for seizure
control. Animals that have phenobarbital levels of 35 ug/ml or
greater and continue to have an unacceptable number of seizures
may have KBr added at 22 mg/kg every 12 hours. Most dogs with
cluster seizures cannot be controlled with phenobarbital alone.
Within a few days to a week when the KBr begins to take effect,
the animal may become sedated and ataxic. The phenobarbital
can then be reduced by 1O% every 7 days until sedation resolves
The most effective way to manage a dog with severe cluster
seizures is to maintain a serum KBr level of 400o-5000 μg/ml
with a phenobarbital level of 25-35 μg/ml.
V Phenobarbital and KBr used alone or in combination control
seizures in over 8o% of animals with idiopathic or probable
symptomatic epilepsy. When phenobarbital or KBr alone or
together are unsuccessful in controlling seizures or their side
effects are intolerable, and lowering the dosage results in seizures,
other anticonvulsants may be considered. Other drugs rarely used
in dogs include primidone, diphenylhydantoin, chlorazepate,
felbamate, valproic acid, and gabapentin. Hepatotoxicity and
expense limit the use of these agents.
Other Rarely Used
Anticonvulsant Drugs
 Primidone (Mysoline, Athena) can cause irreversible liver
damage in dogs and should be used with extreme caution.
Primidone may be administered at 15-22 mg/kg PO every 12
hours for dogs. Primidone is toxic to cats and should not be used.
112
Monthly monitoring of liver function with pre- and post-prandial
bile acids is essential for the first 6 months and every 3 months
thereafter. If liver function becomes abnormal, the dose is reduced
over a 3-week period and then discontinued. Much of the anticon-
vulsant effect of primidone is from phenobarbital, one of its
metabolites. Phenobarbital levels are monitored in dogs on
primidone as they correlate with anticonvulsant efficacy.
Therapeutic serum levels are 15-45 pg/ml of phenobarbital. Some
seizures that were not controlled with phenobarbital might be
controlled with primidone.
V Diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin, Parke-Davis) has a short half-
life, is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and is not
very effective for seizure control in dogs. Diphenylhydantoin is
toxic to cats and should not be used in this species.
Diphenylhydantoin 25-30 mg/kg PO every 6 hours may be
  n     o  s
serum level of 10-20 μg/ml after 2 weeks. When used in
conjunction with phenobarbital or primidone, the risk of hepato
toxicity is increased.
V Chorazepate (Tranxene, Abbott) has a half-life in dogs of
approximately 4 to 6 hours and is not very effective when used
alone. The dose of chlorazepate is 0.6-2 mg/kg PO every 8 hours
for dogs. When used in combination with phenobarbital, a lower
dose is suggested as serum phenobarbital levels are increased.
Sedation and ataxia may necessitate further dose reduction. The
serum phenobarbital and chlorazepate levels may be measured at 2
and 4 weeks, respectively. Generic preparations may reduce the
costs of therapy. Chlorazepate may be useful for short-term break.
through seizure control.
V Felbamate (Felbatol, Wallace) 5-100 mg/kg PO every 8 hours
may be used alone or in conjunction with phenobarbital and KBr
for refractory generalized or focal seizures in dogs. It may be best to
start at the lowest dose and then increase the dose in increments of 5
mg/kg every 8 hours. Although the half-life of felbamate is 4.5-6.5
hours in dogs, it may be effective as a single therapy for focal seizures.
Excessive sedation may occur when felbamate is administered in
conjunction with phenobarbital or primidone. Phenobarbital serum
concentrations may increase when felbamate is added, which may
increase the risk for hepatotoxicity. The expense of felbamate limits
its use in dogs.
V Valproic acid (Depakene, Abbott) has not proven to be very
effective as a single anticonvulsant in dogs. It has been used in combi.
nation with phenobarbital but increases the risk of hepatotoxicity.
The expense of valproic acid also limits its use in veterinary medicine.
113
V Gabapentin (Neurontin, Parke-Davis) has an elimination half-
life in dogs of 3 to 4 hours, and effective serum levels may be
difficult to achieve even if doses are given every 6 hours. Some
anticonvulsant effect may be achieved in dogs with gabapentin
6-15 mg/kg PO every 6 hours. The expense of this drug limits its
use in veterinary medicine
V Topiramate (Topamax, Ortho-McNeil), zonisimide (Zonegran,
Elan), and levitiracetam (Keppra; VCB Inc.) are new anticonvul-
sant drugs recently developed for use in humans that may be useful
in the future for dogs. Many other new drugs are currently under
investigation. Other methods for controlling refractory seizures,
including vagal nerve stimulation, surgical interventions, and
radiation therapy, may play a role in the future treatment of
epilepsy in dogs and cats.
Therapy at Home to Control
Cluster Seizures
V Some dogs have episodes of cluster seizures every few months,
which necessitate trips to the emergency room. A compounding
pharmacist can make diazepam suppositories (0.5-2 mg/kg each),
which the owner can insert rectally when seizures begin.
Administration can be repeated for a total of 3 doses within a 24
hour period if seziures continue. Injectable diazepam may also be

Diagnostic Evaluation
Important Historical Questions
· Was the onset acute or chronic? Progressive?
● Are tremors absent during sleep?
● Is the animal able to walk, eat, and drink?
· If adult intact female, recent whelping?
· Are other littermates affected?
● Has there been exposure to pesticides, herbicides, heavy
metals, prescription drugs, or other toxic substances?
· Has there been recent exposure to prescription, over-the
counter, or illegal drugs, nutriceuticals, or herbal preparations?
117
Physical and Neurologic
Examinations
V White dogs seem to be predisposed to nonsuppurative menin-
goencephalitis and idiopathic tremors of adult dogs. Ataxia,
paresis, and/or conscious proprioceptive deficits may be present
in all disorders except idiopathic tremors of adult dogs.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis are performed to detect systemic illness and as part of
the preanesthetic evaluation.
V Hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and other electrolyte abnormal-
ities may be found on the serum chemistry profile.
V Serum cholinesterase levels will be below the normal range if
organophosphate toxicosis is present.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultra-
sound are evaluated for masses.
V The following are tests that are performed under general anesthesia:
· CSF analysis will show elevated leukocytes and protein levels
in cases of nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis.
· Electroencephalography (EEG) will often have generalized slow
waves and increased amplitude in cases of meningoencephalitis.
V Serum and CSF immunoassays for specific organisms are
obtained if an infection is suspected.
Tremor Disorders
Hypocalcemia
V Hypocalcemia can cause neuronal membrane instability and
tremors in dogs and cats. Ataxia and seizures may also occur. Facial
pruritis may be present. Hypocalcemia may be associated with many
diseases, and an overview is found in Table 4-1. The serum calcium
level is usually less than 8 mg/dl. In an acute hypocalcemic crisis,
treatment with 10% calcium gluconate solution 0.5-1.5 ml/kg
(up to 20 ml) IV slowly over 20 to 30 minutes will usually stop
the tremors. Respiration and the cardiac rate and rhythm are
monitored during administration, preferably with the aid of an elec-
trocardiogram (ECG). If respiratory depression, bradycardia, ST

segment elevation or Q-T interval shortening are noted, the
infusion is temporarily discontinued until the abnormalities resolve
and then reinstated at a slower rate. After the acute crisis, 1o%
calcium gluconate solution 0.5-1.5 ml/kg IV may be diluted 1:1
with saline and given at a rate of 10-15 ml/kg over a 24-hour
period. Oral therapy is often initiated. The underlying cause should
be investigated and addressed. The prognosis varies greatly.
Hypoglycemia
V Hypoglycemia is more likely to cause stupor, coma, or seizures
rather than tremors. This disorder is discussed in Section 2, and
its causes are outlined in Section 2,Table 2-5.
Intoxications
 Many toxic substances cause tremors. The possibility of
exposure to pyrethrin and pyrethroid insecticides, organophos.
phates, ivermectin, ethylene glycol, chlorinated hydrocarbons,
metaldehyde, hexachlorophene, herbicides, toxic plants, heavy
metals, and any prescription, over-the-counter, or illegal drugs
should be explored with the client. An overview of the
commonly used organophosphates and organocarbamates that
can cause intoxication are listed in Table 4-2.
119
Table 4-2
Commonly Used Organophosphates
● Malathion
● Parathion
·Diazinon
● Carbaryl (Sevin)
●Bendiocarb (Ficam)
● Propoxur (Baygon, Dendran)
● Chlorpyrifos (Dursban)
● Methylcarbamate
● Chlorfenvinphos (Dermaton dip)
●Cythioate (Proban)
●Dichlorvos (Vapona)
● Dioxathion
●Fenthion (ProSpot)
● Ronnel
● Phosmet
● Disulfoton (Di-Syston)
●Golden Malrin (fly bait)
V Chlorpyrifos intoxication from improper application of dips or
exposure to treated homes and yards is a common cause of tremors.
Serum cholinesterase is often less than 500 IU (normal range is 800
to 1200 IU) in dogs and cats with organophosphate intoxication.
Muscle fasciculation associated with organophosphate intoxication
can be reduced with pralidoxime chloride (Protopam, Wyeth-
Ayerst) 10-15 mg/kg SQ every 8 to 12 hours until recovery
occurs. This therapy is most effective if begun in the first 24 hours
after exposure. The animal should be bathed to remove any residual
chemicals and reduce further absorption. Supportive care with fluids
2-4 ml/kg/hr IV and quality nutrition is essential. Recovery often
occurs within 1 to 4 weeks
V When in doubt about a substance, the ASPCA National Animal
Poison Control Center (888-426-4435) or another poison control
center can provide additional information on the potential for intoxi-
cation and treatment. Emergency management for oral intoxication is
outlined in Section 2, Table 2-4. Tremors may be controlled with
diazepam 0.5 mg/kg IV up to 10 mg in dogs and 5 mg in cats. A
constant-rate infusion of diazepam (Section 3, Table 3-5) O.1-2
mg/kg/hr IV may be administered with an infusion pump, as tremors
may not be controlled by single injections. Respiration, heart rate and
rhythm, body temperature, and blood pressure should be monitored
and maintained within normal ranges. Many cases of intoxication
recover with symptomatic treatment and fluid therapy.
120
Nonsuppurative
Meningoencephalomyelitis and
Idiopathic Tremors of Adult Dogs
V Nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis and idiopathic
tremors of adult dogs are considered together as their clinical
appearance, treatment, and prognosis are the same, and they may
be the same disease process. The only difference is the presence
or absence of other abnormalities on the neurologic examination
and CSF Both cause acute tremors in dogs. White dogs, such as
Maltese terriers (Figure 4-1), are often affected. This has lead tc
their description as "little white shakers" or "shaky white dog
disease." Any dog can develop this disorder, so it should not be
excluded based on coat color or size of the dog. The tremors may
affect only the pelvic limbs or may be diffuse to include thoracic
limbs and the head and eyes. In some affected dogs, tremors are
the only abnormal clinical sign. Other cases may also have head
tilt,ataxia,paraparesis,or quadriparesis.
V No history of toxic exposure can be found. The CBC and
serum chemistry profile, including calcium levels, are normal.
The CSF may be normal or can contain increased leukocytes
(primarily lymphocytes and occasionally a mixed cell population)
with normal or increased protein. Serum and CSF immunoassays
should be obtained in cases where CSF leukocytic pleocytosis is
present, but the results of these tests are normal in dogs with
nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis. Computed tomography
(CI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) are usually normal
or may show mild ventricular enlargement.
 If the dog has only tremors and no CSF abnormalities, then a
diagnosis of idiopathic tremors of adult dogs is made. If the dog
has tremors plus other neurologic signs and/or abnormal CSF, then
a diagnosis of nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis is made.
V Treatment with prednisone 2-4 mg/kg/day PO is given for 2
weeks then reduced to 1-2 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. The dosage
should then be gradually tapered over the next month, given on
alternate days, and then discontinued. Oral famotidine (Pepcid
AC, Merck) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours, cimetidine
(Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours, or
misoprostol (Cytotec, Searle) 1-3 μg/kg every 8 hours will reduce
the chance of gastrointestinal ulceration and irritation when the
dose of prednisone is high.
121
Y Tremors are controlled in both nonsuppurative meningoen-
cephalomyelitis and idiopathic tremors of adult dogs with
diazepam 0.5-2 mg/kg PO every 6 to 8 hours, not to exceed
10 mg every 6 hours, as needed to control tremors. Diazepam is
continued for 1 month, and then the dosage is reduced by 25%
per week. If tremors reappear, then the lowest effective dose to
control the tremors is re-instituted. This is repeated until the
tremors completely resolve, which may take 1 to 3 months.
Diazepam is never abruptly discontinued as tremors and seizures
from withdrawal might occur. The prognosis for both nonsuppura
tive meningoencephalomyelitis and idiopathic tremors of adult
dogs is excellent, and most affected dogs eventually return to
normal.
ldiopathic Tremors of
Geriatric Dogs
V Geriatric dogs often develop intermittent or continuous
tremors of the pelvic limbs when standing. The cause is
unknown, but many tremor syndromes of elderly humans have
been associated with neuronal degeneration in the basal nuclei
and other specific neuronal regions. A similar process is
suspected in dogs. No therapy is recommended, and the tremors
do not usually resolve.
Episodic ldiopathic Head Tremors
or Bobbing
/ Doberman pinschers, Shetland sheepdogs, and wired-haired
fox terriers may have episodic head bobbing or tremors of
unknown cause. Stress or excitement may precipitate the
episodes, but affected dogs are usually normal upon presentation.
Historically, the episodes occur only periodically and last several
minutes. The owner is unable to stop the bobbing or tremors by
petting or reassuring the dog. Partial seizures (Section 3) have
been suspected in some cases. A CBC, serum chemistry profile
(including calcium), CSF analysis, and EEG are normal. Nc
treatment is usually prescribed as the episodes are brief and do
not interfere with the dog's normal functions.
122
Hypomyelination or
Dysmyelination
V Abnormal myelin development in chow chows, springer
spaniels, Weimeraners, and other dogs can result in diffuse,
whole-body tremors in puppies from 3 to 12 weeks of age. More
than one dog in the litter is often affected to varying degrees.
The tremors are absent during rest and sleep and worsen with
excitement or cold. Tremors may be so severe that affected
puppies find it difficult to walk, eat, or drink. The CBC and
serum chemistry profile are normal. The diagnosis is suspected by
ruling out other diseases. There is no treatment available, but
with supportive care and assistance with eating and drinking,
many of these puppies improve over the course of several months
and may become normal or acceptable pets. The underlying
cause may be genetic or related to viral infection im utero.

125
Definitions
Head tilt: The head is cocked to one side so that one ear is
closer to the ground than the other (Figure 5-1).
Dysequilibrium: Loss of balance to one or both sides character-
ized by leaning, falling, rolling, or circling with a head tilt.
Nystagmus: Involuntary eye movements characterized by a slow
movement in one direction (slow phase) and then a rapid jerk in
the opposite direction (fast phase).
Vestibular system: The peripheral nervous system (PNS) and
central nervous system (CNS) pathways responsible for main-
taining balance and normal head and eye posture.
Vestibular labyrinth: A membranous system of communicating
epithelial sacs and ducts in the inner ear that contains endolym-
phatic fluid; divisions of the vestibular labyrinth include three
semicircular canals, the utricle, and the saccule; receptors in the
vestibular labyrinth connect to the vestibular nerve (cranial
nerve [CN] 8) and sense angular and linear acceleration and
deceleration as well as head and eye position relative to gravity.
Normal or physiologic nystagmus: Eye movements induced
when the head is moved from side to side or up and down with
the fast phase toward the direction of movement; normal
nystagmus requires the integrity of the vestibular nerves (CN 8),
oculomotor nerves (CN 3), trochlear nerves (CN 4), abducens
nerves (CN 6), and their connections through the medulla
oblongata, pons, and midbrain.
Post-rotatory nystagmus: If the animal is spun in a circle for a
minute or more, a brief normal nystagmus with the fast phase
away from the direction turned is induced when the movement
is stopped.
Spontaneous nystagmus: Abnormal nystagmus occurring
without outward stimulus regardless of head position.
Positional nystagmus: Abnormal nystagmus occurring only
when the head is in certain positions.
Horizontal nystagmus: Eye movements occurring side to side in
a straight line.
Rotatory nystagmus: Eye movements occurring side to side in
an arc.
Vertical nystagmus: Eye movements occurring upward and
downward in a straight line.
126
Positional strabismus: An abnormal position of one eye
observed only when the head is in certain positions; when the
head is straightened and the nose is elevated, the eye on the side
of the head tilt drops below the level of the other eye.
Myringotomy: Puncture of the tympanic membrane for removal
of fluid from the middle ear.
Figure 5-1 Acute onset of a right head tilt associated with an idiopathic
vestibular syndrome is common in geriatric dogs.

Lesion Localization
The Vestibular System
V The vestibular system is shown in Figures 5-2 and 5-3.
Specific locations of lesions that cause head tilt, dysequilibrium,
and nystagmus are the:
· Peripheral nervous system (PNS): Sensory receptors in the
vestibular labyrinth and the vestibulocochlear nerves (CN 8)
· Central nervous system (CNS): The vestibular nuclei in
the medulla oblongata and the flocculonodular lobe of
the cerebellum.

Diagnostic Evaluation
Important Historical Questions
· Acute nonprogressive, acute progressive, or
chronic progressive?
· Past or present ear infections?
· Recent ear cleaning?
· Recent trauma?
· Is animal currently on metronidazole?
· Recent use of aminoglycoside antibiotics or
other medications?
· Other current or previous illness?
132
Physical Examination
V Examine the external ear canals for evidence of otitis or tumors.
V Examine the pharynx for evidence of inflammation or tumors.
Y Examine the animal for evidence of systemic disease or neoplasia.
Neurologic
: Examination
V The neurologic examination commonly shows unilateral vestibular
signs. Affected pets may have one or more of the following signs:
· Head tilt with leaning, falling, rolling, or circling to one side
· Spontaneous nystagmus
●Positional nystagmus
● Positional strabismus
V Less commonly, examination will reveal bilateral vestibular
signs. One or more of the following signs may be present:
· Absent or mild head tilt but wide swinging head movements
side to side
· Leaning, falling, rolling, and loss of balance to both sides
· Circling to both sides
● Loss of normal physiologic nystagmus
● Loss of normal post-rotatory nystagmus
· Neck and thoracic limbs curl ventrally when the animal is
held by the pelvis and suspended in air
Y Determine whether the vestibular lesion is in the PNS or CNS.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis can be useful to detect systemic illness and as part of the
preanesthetic evaluation.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultrasonog
raphy are useful to detect primary or metastatic neoplasia as well
as cardiopulmonary disease.
V A low serum total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 and an
diagnosis of hypothyroidism.
V Tests that are performed under general anesthesia, as well as
their findings, are as follows:
· Routine or electronic otoscopic examination of the external
ear canals and tympanic membranes to detect evidence of
infection or masses.
133
● If a middle ear infection is suspected, myringotomy is
attempted for cytologic evaluation and culture of fluid,
if obtained.
· Bacterial and fungal cultures of the external or middle ears
and antibiotic sensitivity to determine whether infection
is present.
● Biopsy or surgical removal and histologic examination of
external or middle ear masses.
· Radiographs, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) of the osseous bullae, inner ear, medulla
oblongata, and cerebellum to determine whether otitis media or
interna, traumatic fractures, cerebrovascular disorders, menin-
goencephalitis, or neoplasia is present.
● CSF analysis to evaluate for leukocytic pleocytosis and
increased protein levels in meningoencephalitis, or CNS neo.
plasia.
· Brainstem auditory-evoked response (BAER) to evaluate the
auditory part of CN 8 and the brainstem pathways of hearing;
may also differentiate PNS and CNS lesions.
V Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immunoassays for
specific organisms are performed if meningoencephalitis is
suspected (Section 2).
Warning: Although recovery from vestibular signs may appear
complete, when an animal with a past vestibular problem is placed in
water, gravity is altered and dysequilibrium may cause drowning.
Vestibular Labyrinth and
Nerve Disorders
ldiopathic Vestibular Syndrome
V Sudden onset of head tilt, dysequilibrium, and nystagmus
without a known cause may occur in any dog or cat but is most
common in geriatric dogs (Figure 5-1) and young cats. The
initial signs may be so severe that the animal is unable to stand
and rolls whenever handled, making examination difficult.
 A common misconception in geriatric dogs is that the
animal has had a "stroke" and that the prognosis is poor, as the
dysequilibrium is so severe that the animal cannot stand or
134
ambulate for several days. Because of their age and severity of the
initial signs, dogs with geriatric idiopathic vestibular syndrome
are often not given the chance to recover and are euthanized.
V Other cranial nerve or other neurologic deficits and Horner's
syndrome are absent on the neurologic examination. On rare
occasions, bilateral vestibular signs occur, and although there is
no head tilt, the equilibrium disturbance is obvious.
V The diagnosis is suspected after ruling out other causes of
vestibular disease and seeing improvement over the following 72
hours with supportive care only. In the first 24 to 48 hours, oral
meclizine hydrochloride (Antivert, Pfizer) 6.25 mg once daily
for cats and 12-25 mg once daily for dogs may be given to
reduce the animal's dizziness. Diazepam O.1-0.25 mg/kg PO
every 8 hours may be given to reduce distress if meclizine is not
available but may cause some sedation. Some animals vomit
within the first 24 hours after onset of the signs, but this usually
resolves without treatment.
V An osmolality disturbance of the fluid within the vestibular
labyrinth is suspected in cases of idiopathic vestibular syndrome.
The prognosis is excellent. Improvement begins within 72 hours,
and most animals return to normal in 1 to 3 weeks. Some
animals may retain a permanent head tilt. In cases with bilateral
vestibular nerve involvement, recovery is often prolonged and
incomplete, and permanent hearing loss may result. Recurrence
is possible but rare.
Otitis lnterna
VA unilateral or bilateral inner ear infection or otitis interna is a
common cause of vestibular disease in dogs and cats (Figure 5-6). A
bacterial infection of the external ear canals or the throat and
eustachian tubes may extend into the middle ear and then into
the inner ear. The inner ear may less commonly become infected
via a hematogenous route. Fungal infections are rare. Onset of
vestibular signs may be acute or chronic and progressive
Horner's syndrome from infection of the middle ear (otitis
media) may be present. Facial nerve (CN 7) paresis or paralysis
causing reduced or absent movement of the eyelids, lip, and ear
and reduced or absent tear production commonly occurs with
otitis media and interna. Hearing may be obviously affected in
bilateralotitisinterna.
V Otitis externa, inflammation of the external ear canal, may be
obvious on physical or otoscopic examination, but the external
135
ear canals can also be normal. An electronic otoscope is most
useful to detect bulging, opacity, or tears in the tympanic
membrane (Figure 5-7). Myringotomy may be considered to
collect samples from the middle ear for cytologic testing,
bacterial culture, and antibiotic sensitivity.

pointer with a left head tilt associ-
ated with an inner earinfection.

brane as viewed with an elec-
tronic otoscope.

V Fluid densities or osteomyelitis may be evident on radiography
and CT of the osseous bullae, but MRI is often the best method
for visualizing the middle and inner ears (Figure 5-8).
Y Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is selected based on the
culture and sensitivity results. If the culture results are negative
but bacterial otitis interna is suspected, then enrofloxacin
(Baytril, Bayer) 5 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for dogs or cats or a
combination of trimethoprim-sulfadiazine 15-30 mg/kg PO every
12 hours and cephalexin (Keflex, Dista) 22 mg/kg PO every 8

hours may be administered. Antibiotic therapy should be
continued for 6-8 weeks. Tear production should be monitored
to detect keratoconjunctivitis sicca associated with facial nerve
(CN 7) involvement, and antibiotic therapy and artificial tears
should be administered if necessary to prevent keratitis and
corneal ulceration.
Warning: The owner may prematurely discontinue the antibiotics within
the first few weeks of therapy when the signs resolve. This leads to chron-
ic infections, osteomyelitis, and antibiotic-resistant organisms that can be
difficult to cure. Owners must be strongly wamed of these complications.
 In cases of concurrent otitis externa and media with a
ruptured tympanic membrane, the external and middle ears are
gently flushed with saline or a 2.5% acetic acid solution; caustic
ear cleaning substances
avoided if possible. Diluted ear
cleaning solutions may be necessary in some cases for debris that
cannot be cleared by other means, but thorough rinsing is
essential so residual solution does not irritate the vestibular
labyrinth. The external ear canal may be treated topically with
small amounts of low-residue, nonirritating antibiotic solutions
for a few days, but accumulation of greasy ointments in the
middle ear should be avoided.
V Vestibular signs may resolve in 1 to 2 weeks, but if antibiotics
are prematurely discontinued, the clinical signs and infection
recur and can be more difficult to treat.
137
V Corticosteroids are usually not required and are avoided if
osteomyelitis is present. In acute cases, prednisone 0.25 mg/kg
PO once daily for 1-3 days is sometimes given to reduce inflam-
mation and swelling of the vestibular labyrinth. In animals with
recurring otitis, underlying dermatologic problems, such as atopy
or hypothyroidism, should be investigated and treated. Ear
hygiene should be monitored, but care should be taken when
cleaning the external ear canals (see Iatrogenic Vestibular
Syndrome, below).
V Some chronic inner ear infections may require surgical
removal of debris from the middle ear through bulla osteotomy.
Various surgical procedures to resect the lateral external ear
canal may also be beneficial for long-term management of
chronic otitis. A rare complication of chronic inner ear infection
is an ascending infection into the brainstem region causing
bacterial meningitis or abscess formation, which can be very
difficult to treat. The treatment of bacterial meningitis is found
in Section 2, Table 11.
V The prognosis for recovery from otitis interna is good with
early and appropriate antibiotic therapy. A residual head tilt,
Horner's syndrome, or facial paralysis may result in a few cases
but dysequilibrium resolves.
Head Trauma
V Acute vestibular dysfunction may be associated with a blow to
the head. Blood is often found in the external ear canal, and
facial nerve (CN 7) paralysis and Horner's syndrome may also be
observed. Diagnosis and treatment of head injuries are discussed
in Section 2. Vestibular signs may resolve completely in time,
although a residual head tilt is possible
latrogenic Vestibular Syndrome
from Ear Cleaning
Y Acute unilateral and bilateral vestibular dysfunction with or
without deafness may occur following routine ear cleaning in
both dogs and cats but appears to be more frequent in cats.
Rupture of the tympanic membrane and damage to the vestibular
labyrinth of the inner ear are suspected. Chlorhexidine and other
ear wash preparations suspected to be caustic to the vestibular
labyrinth have been incriminated, but attempts to experimentally
re-create the problem have failed. A vestibular syndrome may
also follow ear cleaning with water alone.
138
V Treatment with corticosteroids as soon as signs appear may reduce
any associated inflammation or edema. Methylprednisolone sodium
succinate (Solu-Medrol, Pharmacia & Upjohn) 10 mg/kg IV every
6 to 8 hours for 24 hours followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg PO for
2 to 3 days may improve recovery in some cases. To protect against
gastrointestinal side effects from corticosteroid administration oral
famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12 to 24 hours,
cimetidine (Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg every 8
hours, or misoprostol (Cytotec, Searle) 1-3 μg/kg every 8 hours may
be administered. Vestibular signs often resolve in 1 to 3 weeks, but
some animals may retain dysequilibrium and hearing loss.
Polyps and Neoplasia
V Nasopharyngeal polyps and squamous cell carcinoma of the
external and middle ears may affect the vestibular labyrinth.
Vestibular dysfunction may result, but primary neoplasia of the
vestibular nerve is rare. Nasopharyngeal polyps and squamous cell
carcinoma can often be visualized on examination of the external ear
canal and pharynx and with CT or MRI. Surgical removal may be
attempted. Removal of squamous cell carcinoma often requires
ablation of the external ear canal and bulla osteotomy.
Nasopharyngeal polyps are common in cats and can often be
completely removed (Figures 5-9 and 5-10). Squamous cell carcinoma
has a poorer prognosis. Neoplasia affecting the osseous bullae may
occur and is often obvious on routine radiography (Figure 5-11).
Neurofibroma of CN 8 (acoustic neuroma) can cause a chronic,
progressive head tilt. Surgical removal is attempted through bulla
osteotomy. A residual head tilt, facial paralysis, and Horner's
syndrome may occur.

ographs of a 6-year-old boxer with a
neoplastic process that has obliterat-
ed the osseous bulla on the left at

bulla on the right); the dog had a left
head tilt.
140
Hypothyroidism
W Hypothyroidism may cause acute or chronic unilateral
vestibular signs with or without facial nerve paralysis, laryngeal
paralysis, or megaesophagus in dogs. Hair coat changes and other
signs typical of hypothyroidism are often absent. Microcytic
anemia and elevated cholesterol may be found on the CBC and
chemistry profile, respectively. The diagnosis is best made
through demonstration of a low serum total T4 or free T4 level
and elevated serum TSH level. Levothyroxine sodium (Soloxine.
Daniels Pharmaceuticals) O.02 mg/kg PO every 12 hours is
given. The serum T4 level is re-evaluated after 4 weeks of
therapy, and the levothyroxine dose is adjusted to maintain
thyroxine in the normal range. A localized metabolic cranial
neuropathy or a cranial polyneuromyopathy is caused by
hypothyroidism (Section 6). The prognosis is excellent, as the
neurologic signs usually respond to treatment.
Aminoglycoside lntoxication
 Systemic or topical gentamicin, amikacin, and streptomycin may
cause toxic destruction of receptors in the vestibular labyrinth and
cochlea. Animals receiving these antibiotics should be closely
monitored for dysequilibrium and deafness. The drugs should be
discontinued immediately if signs appear. Dysequilibrium may
improve, but some permanent hearing damage may occur.
Medulla
a Oblongata and
Cerebellar Disorders
Meningoencephalitis
V Meningoencephalitis can produce acute or chronic progressive
vestibular signs with hemiparesis, hypermetria, or both, indicating
involvement of the rostral medulla oblongata, cerebellum, or both,
respectively. Neurologic deficits assoc iated with other cranial nerves,
brainstem segments, and the cerebrum may also occur, indicating a
treatments, and the prognosis varies with each (see Tables 2-8, 2-9, 2
10, and 2-11). The CSF often exhibits leukocytic pleocytosis with or
without an elevated protein level. Although CT may show a lesion of
the brainstem or cerebellum, MRI is far superior to visualize brainstem
and cerebellar lesions (Figure 5-12).

and the right cerebellum is on the viewer's left).
V A biopsy with histologic examination may be necessary to differ
   q s   s s
mass lesions on CT or MRI. An overview of the diagnosis and
treatment of meningoencephalitis can be found in Section 2.
Trauma
 Head injuries may result in trauma to the rostral medulla
oblongata and cerebellum, leading to vestibular dysfunction.
Brainstem contusion or hemorrhage in the rostral medulla often
results in death due to involvement of vital pathways for respira
tion, cardiac function, and blood pressure. Diagnosis and
treatment of head injuries are discussed in Section 2.
Cerebrovascular Disorders
Y Acute vestibular dysfunction from cerebrovascular disorders
(infarction or spontaneous hemorrhage) of the brainstem or cere-
142
bellum occur occasionally in animals. CT and MRI are often
normal but may occasionally show multifocal abnormalities. CSF
analysis is also usually normal but can have increased protein
levels. Serial neurologic examinations show slow improvement of
neurologic signs over a period of 6 to 8 weeks. Cerebrovascular
disorders are discussed in Section 2.
Metronidazole lntoxication
 Animals on metronidazole (Flagyl, SCS) therapy may have acute
onset of ataxia, tremors, and vertical nystagmus consistent with CNS
vestibular disease. Severe depression and seizures may also occur.
Signs of intoxication may develop early or late in the course of
metronidazole therapy and may occur at both high and low doses.
Metronidazole should be discontinued immediately, and seizures are
controlled initially with intravenous anticonvulsant therapy (Section
3, Table 3-4). Signs of intoxication usually improve within 24 to 72
hours of drug discontinuation and usually resolve within a week. Liver
function should be evaluated with fasting and 2-hour post-prandial
bile acids determinations, as an underlying liver problem may cause
intoxication occurring at low doses.
Neoplasia
V Adult or geriatric dogs and cats may develop acute or chronic
progressive brainstem or cerebellar vestibular dysfunction due to
neoplasia. CSF analysis usually shows elevated protein, but leuko.
cytic pleocytosis is less common. Neoplasia is best visualized with
MRI, but histologic examination of tissue obtained from a biopsy or
surgical removal is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment
can be rewarding in some cases, such as with the removal of a cere-
bellar meningioma plus adjunctive radiation therapy, which may
prolong the animal's survival time by years. Brainstem neoplasia is
usually a greater challenge, as the area of involvement is more
difficult to reach surgically. The types, diagnosis, and therapy of
brain neoplasia are discussed in Section 2.
Parasite Migration
V Cuterebra larvae may migrate through the brainstem and
cerebellum and cause vestibular dysfunction. Neutrophilic leuko.
cytosis and elevated protein may be found on CSF analysis.
Prednisone 0.25-0.5mg/kg PO every 12 hours may reduce the
inflammation associated with parasite migration and improve
function. The disorder is usually diagnosed during necropsy.

Strabismus: Unilateral or bilateral deviation of the eye or eyes
due to paralysis of one or more of the extraocular muscles.
Mydriasis: Dilated pupil associated with fear or a lesion of the
oculomotor nerve (CN 3).
Miosis: Constricted pupil associated with a lesion of the sympa-
thetic nerves to the eye.
Ptosis: Reduction in the size of the palpebral fissure secondary to
paresis of the levator muscles of the eyelid; associated with a
lesion of the oculomotor nerve (CN 3) or sympathetic nerves to
the eye.
Enophthalmos: Backward displacement of the eyeball into the
orbit that induces passive elevation of the third eyelid and a
slight reduction in the diameter of the palpebral fissure; associ-
ated with lesions of the sympathetic nerves to the eye.
Jaw paralysis: Inability to close the mouth associated with
bilateral dysfunction of the trigeminal nerves (CN 5) (Figure 6-1).

Lesion Localization
V The location of lesions that cause cranial myopathies and
neuropathies are shown in Figures 6-2 and 6-3. These lesions are
usually found in the:

● Central nervous system (CNS) (brainstem) portion of a
cranial nerve
● Muscles of the head

V Peripheral nerve: Only cranial nerve deficits are present. The
rest of the neurologic examination is normal, unless the cranial
neuropathy is part of a generalized peripheral nerve disease
(Sections 9 and 10).
V Central nervous system: Cranial nerve signs are present in
conjunction with dementia, stupor, unilateral or bilateral
conscious proprioceptive deficits, ataxia, hemiparesis, or quadri-
paresis. Cranial nerves enter or exit the brainstem in the medulla
oblongata, pons, midbrain, or diencephalon (Figure 6-3).
V Muscle disease: Pain on opening the mouth, muscle swelling
or atrophy, and inability to open the mouth due to inflammation
and fibrosis of the muscles of mastication are found; muscle
disorders may be isolated to the head or part of generalized
muscle disease (Section 11).

Diagnostic Evaluation
Important Historical Questions
· Date of onset?
· Acute or chronic? Nonprogressive or progressive?
● How is vision? Difference in day or night?
●How is hearing?
● Is there a change in the appearance of the face?
· Is there any difficulty drinking, eating, chewing, or swallowing?
· Is there regurgitation or change in voice?
· Any weakness of the limbs or exercise intolerance?
· Seizures, dementia, head tilt, or other neurologic signs?
· Possibility of trauma?
· Concurrent or past illness?
· Concurrent or past neoplastic disease?
· Recent or current medications, nutritional supplements, or
exposure to toxins?
Physical Examination
V Examine the ocular fundus for evidence of chorioretinitis or
other retinal disease.
V Examine ears for evidence of otitis externa.
V Examine body for evidence of systemic disease.
Neurologic Examination
V Determine which cranial nerve or nerves or muscles are involved.
V Determine if a PNS or CNS lesion is present.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile and
urinalysis are performed to detect systemic illness and as part of
the preanesthetic evaluation.
V Chest and abdominal radiographs with or without abdominal
ultrasonography may be performed to check for megaesophagus,
aspiration pneumonia, and evidence of neoplasia.
152
V An electroretinogram (ERG) can differentiate retinal disease
from optic neuritis.
V Serum total thyroxine (T4) or free T4 level may be
reduced and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level elevated
with hypothyroidism.
V Serum creatine kinase (CK) may be elevated with myositis.
V Serum acetylcholine receptor antibody level is often elevated
in animals with myasthenia gravis.
V Serum 2M-antibody level is often elevated in dogs with masti-
catory myositis.
V The following are tests that are performed under general anes-
thesia, as well as their findings:
● An electromyogram (EMG) can be useful to determine if
there are lesions in more than one cranial nerve or if diffuse
polyneuropathy or polymyopathy or myasthenia gravis is present.
· A brainstem auditory-evoked response (BAER) test is used to
evaluate hearing and brainstem integrity.
· Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) can be abnormal in cases of retrobulbar and ocular dis-
ease, inner ear infection and neoplasia, meningoencephalitis,
brainstem neoplasia, and trauma.
· The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is often abnormal in
cases of meningoencephalitis or neoplasia.
· A biopsy of the temporalis and masseter muscles will show
inflammation and necrosis in cases of masticatory myositis.
Peripheral Nerve and
Muscle Disorders
Blindness
V Visual deficits with dilated pupils that do not respond to light are
usually associated with diseases of the retina or optic nerves (CN 2).
Chorioretinitis, retinal detachment, and some forms of retinal degen-
eration can be visualized on funduscopic examination. Chorioretinitis
may be associated with viral, protozoal, fungal, rickettsial, and other
infections as well as granulomatous meningoencephalitis (Section 2).
Severe chorioretinitis can result in retinal detachment; this may also
be caused by immune-mediated, inherited, neoplastic or idiopathic
153
disorders, and systemic hypertension. Retinal degeneration is a
common cause of blindness in dogs but can also occur in cats.
Progressive retinal atrophy is usually inherited. Other causes of retinal
degeneration are taurine deficiency in cats, enrofloxacin toxicity in
cats, vitamin E deficiency, and glaucoma.
 Sudden blindness in dogs with a normal ocular fundus but
absent pupillary light reflexes could be due to SARDS, optic
neuritis,or toxic optic neuropathy (Figure 6-5). Some cases of
optic neuritis show swelling of the optic disk (Figure 6-6), but
the disk may also appear normal. Since toxic optic neuropathies
have been described in humans, all recent or current medica-
tions, nutritional supplements, or exposure to toxic substances
should be considered for the potential of neurotoxicity and
discontinued if possible. The ERG is abnormal in animals with
SARDS but not in optic neuritis, and differentiation of these
two diseases is essential, as early diagnosis and treatment of optic
neuritis may restore vision. There is no effective treatment for
SARDS, and it appears to be a sudden photoreceptor cell death
of unknown cause with no associated inflammation.
 Optic neuritis may be associated with an infectious agent
(e.g., canine distemper virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus,
Toxoplasma gondii, and some fungi), granulomatous meningoen-
cephalitis, a paraneoplastic syndrome, trauma, or
immune-mediated disorders. It can also be idiopathic. Any
enlarged lymph nodes should be aspirated to detect infection or
neoplasia. CSF analysis, serum and CSF organism immunoassays,

and MRI may be useful to rule out concurrent meningoen-
cephalitis or neoplasia. Treatment of meningoencephalitis is
found in Section 2, Tables 2-10 and 2-11.A thorough examina
tion for neoplasia elsewhere in the body should be performed. If
other causes are ruled out, then a diagnosis of idiopathic optic
neuritis is made. Since idiopathic optic neuritis is suspected to be
immune-mediated, immunosuppressive drugs are given.
Y Treatment with prednisone 1-2 mg/kg PO every 12 hours
for 2 to 3 weeks with subsequent tapering of the dose often
improves vision. Famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) O.5-1 mg/kg
PO every 12 to 24 hours, cimetidine (Tagamet, SmithKline
Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours, or misoprostol
(Cytotec, Searle) 1-3 μg/kg PO every 8 hours is recommended to
protect the gastrointesinal tract from upset or ulcers when
steroids are administered at high doses.
V If there is no response to prednisone alone, the antineo-
plastic, immunosuppressive drug procarbazine (Matulene, Sigma
Tau) may be given at 2-4 mg/kg/day PO for 1 week then
increased to 4-6 mg/kg/day. The hemogram and platelet count
should be monitored every week initially. If the leukocyte count
falls below 4000 cells/ul or platelets are less than 100,000
cells/ul, the drug is discontinued until the leukocyte count
returns to normal. Therapy may have to be given for 6 to 12
months to control clinical signs. Periodic drug withdrawal may
be used to see if a relapse of visual deficits occurs. In some cases,
blindness may be permanent.
155
If small optic nerves are visualized on funduscopic examina-
tion of an animal with reduced or absent vision and reduced or
absent pupillary light reflexes, then optic nerve atrophy from a
previous optic neuritis, trauma, retrobulbar inflammation or
compression, glaucoma, or end stage retinal degeneration are
considered. Optic nerve hypoplasia may cause congenital
blindness with absent pupillary light reflexes.
Anisocoria
f Anisocoria with normal vision and no other ophthalmologic
portion of the oculomotor nerve (CN 3) or the sympathetic
innervation of the eye (Figure 6-7). The sympathetic innervation
of the eye is a complex pathway involving three neurons. The
first neuron begins in the hypothalamus and descends through
the brainstem and cervical spinal cord to the T2 region. A
second neuron exits the spinal cord at'I2 and passes through the
thoracic inlet, traveling cranially with the descending vagus
nerve forming the peripheral vagosympathetic nerve. It synapses
with a third neuron at the cranial cervical ganglion in the high
cervical region. The third neuron goes through the middle ear
and into the retrobulbar region to innervate the eye. Lack of
parasympathetic innervation causes mydriasis; lack of sympa-
thetic innervation to the eye causes Horner's syndrome (ptosis,
miosis, and enophthalmos) (Figure 6-8)
V When an animal is presented with anisocoria, the challenge is
to determine which is the abnormal eye-the one with the larger
or smaller pupil. If vision is normal, the pupil is enlarged, and
direct and consensual pupillary light reflexes are absent, then an
oculomotor nerve lesion is likely (Figure 6-9). A small pupil that
fails to dilate in a darkened room is typical of a sympathetic
nerve lesion. Idiopathic anisocoria, which resolves sponta
neously, is common in cats and may also occur in dogs. However,
other causes should be ruled out. Aniscoria may occur with
central nervous system disease but other signs like stupor or
coma (Section 2) will be present.
 Unilateral oculomotor nerve paralysis may be associated with
head trauma and neoplasia (Section 2). CT or MRI of the
midbrain area should be considered. Neurofibroma, meningioma,
and lymphosarcoma may compress the oculomotor nerve as it exits
the brainstem. Neoplasia in this region is very difficult to remove.

V Horner's syndrome with no other neurologic signs is usually
associated with trauma or neoplasia affecting the vagosympathetic
nerve. Thoracic radiographs may reveal a mass in the thoracic
inlet. Horner's syndrome may be associated with inner ear infec.
tions (Section 5), brainstem or cervical spinal cord disorders
(Sections 9 and 10), and with paralysis of the thoracic limb
(Section 14). Retrobulbar masses may also cause anisocoria and
affect either sympathetic or parasympathetic innervation to the
pupil or both. An idiopathic horner's syndrome may occur.

media, and interna.
Figure 6-9 A dilated right pupil (arrow) and ptosis from an oculomotor nerve
(CN 3) lesion in a cat.
Strabismus
W Ventrolateral strabismus may be due to a lesion of the oculo-
motor nerve (CN 3) (Figure 6-1O), while medial strabismus is
usually associated with a lesion of the abducens nerve (CN 6).
Dysfunction of the trochlear nerve (CN 4) is rare in dogs and
cats. Congenital strabismus can be seen in dogs and cats.
Strabismus with no other neurologic signs may be due to trauma
or neoplasia of the associated peripheral nerve. CT or MRI
should be considered if mass lesions of the orbit or cranial nerves
are suspected. Neurofibroma or lymphosarcoma of the oculo-
motor or abducens nerves can occur and are difficult to remove
when they are close to the brainstem. Retrobulbar masses may

nerve (CN 3) lesion in a dog.
cause deviation of the eyeball. Focal extraocular myositis and
fibrosis can result in strabismus in Golden Retrievers, Shar-Peis
and other dogs, but is rare.
Jaw Paralysis
V A syndrome of acute paralysis of the masticatory musculature
occurs in dogs and is manifested by an inability to close the mouth
(jaw paralysis) (Figure 6-1). The cause is unknown, but neuritis of
the trigeminal nerves (CN 5) is suspected. Some dogs also have
unilateral or bilateral Horner's syndrome (see Figure 6-1). Most
dogs are able to ingest a high-calorie, blended, liquid food or gruel
and water to maintain nutrition and hydration. A few dogs may
benefit from gastrostomy tube feeding. Jaw function usually returns
in 4-6 weeks without specific therapy. Jaw paralysis can also occur
from bilateral trauma to the trigeminal nerves, which usually also
resolves without treatment (Figure 6-11).
159
Figure 6-11 A cat with jaw paralysis

present, only bilateral trigeminal nerve
(CN 5) paralysis; the cat recovered
function of the jaw within 2 weeks.
Temporalis and Masseter
Muscle Atrophy
V Masticatory myositis is an immune-mediated disease of dogs
that can be an acute condition characterized by pain on opening
the mouth and muscle swelling or a chronic condition character-
ized by atrophy of the temporalis and masseter muscle and
inability to open the mouth due to muscle fibrosis (Figure 6-12).
The immune-mediated response is directed toward the 2M-type
fibers of the masticatory muscles. Elevated 2M-antibody levels
may be found in the serum of affected dogs. Inflammation and
fibrosis are seen on histologic examination of a muscle biopsy. If
pain occurs only on opening the mouth, retrobulbar or temporo-
mandibular joint disorders should also be considered.
V If masticatory myositis is confirmed, prednisone 1-2 mg/kg
PO every 12 hours is given until jaw mobility returns. The
dosage is then gradually tapered to the level necessary to
maintain mobility. Oral famotidine (Pepcid AC) O.5-1 mg/kg
every 12-24 hours, cimetidine (Tagamet) 5-10 mg/kg every 12
hours, or misoprostol (Cytotec) 1-3 μg/kg every 8 hours may
reduce gastrointestinal irritation when the dose of steroid
therapy is high. If there is no response to prednisone alone, then
other immunosuppressive drugs may be considered. Azathioprine
(Imuran, Glaxo Wellcome) 2 mg/kg PO once daily may be added
to prednisone therapy until improvement is seen and then
reduced to every-other-day dosage indefinitely. Hemograms and
platelets counts should be closely monitored. Supportive care
160
consists of feeding blended food or gruel and water. Recurrence is
common, and alternate-day prednisone therapy may be required
indefinitely to control the disease.
 Early diagnosis and treatment are essential, as chronic
myositis can lead to severe muscle fibrosis and inability to open
the mouth, making eating and drinking impossible. Forceful
opening of the jaw under anesthesia or surgical excision of
fibrosis around the temporomandibular joint may temporarily
open the mouth, but the jaw hangs open following surgery, and
fibrosis usually recurs.
V On rare occasions, masticatory myositis may be asymmetric,
but unilateral atrophy of the temporalis and masseter muscles
is more commonly associated with a traumatic, inflammatory,
or neoplastic disease process affecting the trigeminal nerve
(CN 5) (Figure 6-13).

Facial Nerve Paralysis
V Facial nerve paralysis results in inability to move the eyelid,
ear, or lip on one or both sides (Figure 6-14). In acute condi-
tions, the ear and the lip on the affected side may be flaccid and
hang below the normal side. In chronic paralysis, muscle fibrosis
causes the lip and ear to contract and be carried higher than
those on the normal side. Inability to close the eyelid is usually
obvious on the affected side. The facial nerves innervate the
lacrimal and salivary glands, and lesions may cause dryness of the
eyes and mouth. Food may collect inside the lips on the affected
side. The Schirmer tear test can be useful to evaluate tear
production. Administration of artificial tears in the affected eye
3 to 4 times daily may be needed to prevent keratoconjunctivitis
sicca and corneal ulceration.
Figure 6-14 A Doberman
pinscher with right facial nerve
paralysis from an injury.
V Otitis media commonly causes facial paralysis with no other
signs, especially in dogs with chronic otitis externa. Otitis media
and interna may also cause facial paralysis with Horner's
syndrome and vestibular signs. The diagnosis and treatment of
otitis media and interna are discussed in Section 5.
 Trauma to the facial nerve can cause facial nerve paralysis,
which often resolves in time. Hypothyroidism may also cause
facial paralysis. Microcytic anemia and elevated cholesterol may
be found on the CBC and chemistry profile, respectively, but
hypothyroidism is best diagnosed by demonstrating a low serum
total T4 or free T4 level in conjunction with an elevated TSH.
Levothyroxine sodium (Soloxine, Daniels Pharmaceuticals) O.02
mg/kg PO every 12 hours usually results in a resolution of signs.
162
An EMG can be evaluated to determine if the facial paralysis
is focal or part of a multifocal cranial polyneuropathy.
V Idiopathic facial nerve paralysis is diagnosed by ruling out
other disease processes and is more common in dogs-especially
cocker spaniels-than in cats. Recovery often occurs in 4 to 6
weeks without specific therapy, although paralysis is permanent
in some cases.
Deafness
V Deafness is associated with bilateral disease of the sensory
receptors of the cochlea in the inner ear or the cochlear nerves
(CN 8). Congenital deafness may be an inherited disorder in
many breeds of dogs, particularly Dalmatians and other breeds
with white hair coats and light-colored eyes. Blue-eyed, white
cats are also usually deaf at birth. Puppies and kittens can have
their hearing tested at 6 to 8 weeks of age using a BAER test.
This test can evaluate hearing in each ear individually and
detect unilateral deafness, which is important information for
breeders. Congenital deafness usually results from lack of devel-
opment of the receptor organs of the inner ear that are necessary
for hearing. There is no treatment.
 Any dog or cat with hearing problems should be carefully
evaluated for otitis interna, as early diagnosis and treatment may
resolve the hearing loss. The diagnosis and treatment of otitis
interna is found in Section 5. Intoxication with aminoglycoside
antibiotics-especially amikacin, kanamyc in, and tobramycin-can
cause deafness in dogs and cats. Thus, animals receiving these
drugs should have their hearing monitored. Senile degeneration
of the inner ear structures may occur with age. The use of
hearing aid devices has been attempted but most animals will not
tolerate them.
Dysphagia,
, Megaesophagus.
Dysphonia, and Stridor
/ Dysphagia, megaesophagus, dysphonia, and stridor may all be
associated with dysfunction of vagus nerves (CN 1O). Dysphagia
due to pharyngeal muscle paresis or paralysis can be observed
when the animal attempts to swallow food. Megaesophagus asso-
ciated with paresis or paralysis of the esophageal muscles results
in regurgitation shortly after eating. Dysphonia may be witnessed
163
as the animal attempts to bark or meow. It may be a historical
complaint and is associated with dysfunction of the laryngeal
muscles. Stridor is usually audible and is often associated with
unilateral or bilateral paresis or paralysis of the laryngeal muscles.
Bilateral laryngeal paralysis can result in severe dyspnea and
cyanosis, and emergency measures may have to be taken to
establish a patent airway.
 Trauma to the vagus nerves can cause these signs, and the
diagnosis is usually obvious from the history or physical examina-
tion. Serum diagnostic tests to consider include a serum CK level
for polymyositis; T4, free T4, and TSH for hypothyroidism; and
serum acetylcholine receptor antibodies for myasthenia gravis.
All of these disorders can cause one or more signs of vagus nerve
dysfunction. On rare occasions, lead intoxication can cause
megaesophagus and laryngeal paralysis, so measuring levels of
lead in the blood may be indicated. Hypoadrenocorticism may
occasionally be associated with megaesophagus, so adrenal
function tests may be considered. Thoracic radiographs usually
show megaesophagus, although fluoroscopy with contrast admin-
istration may occasionally be necessary. Evidence of aspiration
pneumonia may be apparent on thoracic radiographs of animals
with dysphagia. Reduced or absent mobility of one or both of the
laryngeal folds are observed with laryngeal ultrasonography and
upon laryngoscopic examination.
Y The EMG may be used to detect diffuse or focal nerve
involvement. Laryngeal paralysis associated with polyneuropathy
has been described in Dalmatians, Rottweilers, and other dogs.
Treatment of the underlying polymyositis, hypothyroidism,
hypoadrenocorticism, myasthenia gravis, or polyneuropathy often
improves the clinical signs (Sections 10 and 11). In laryngeal
paresis, mild sedation may control stridor, but in some cases a
d e  on au aq   
airway. Laryngeal surgery is avoided if possible with these
disorders because the animal may recover once the underlying
problem is controlled, and if the protective function of the
larynx becomes compromised, aspiration pneumonia can be a
serious complication.
V Congenital megaesophagus occurs in pure- and mixed-breed
dogs and cats, including miniature schnauzers, wirehaired fox
terriers, Newfoundland terriers, Labrador retrievers, Shar-Peis,
Irish setters, and Siamese cats. Idiopathic megaesophagus occurs
in Germans shepherds, golden retrievers, Irish setters, Great
164
Danes, and other dogs and cats between 5 and 12 years of age.
There is no specific treatment for congenital or idiopathic
megaesophagus. Supportive care consists of feeding small
amounts of moist food formed into small balls 2-3 times daily
from an elevated surface and then holding the animal vertical for
10-15 minutes after meals to prevent regurgitation. In severe
cases, a gastrostomy tube may be necessary for feeding. About
20% to 40% of dogs with congenital megaesophagus may
improve as they get older, but spontaneous recovery of idiopathic
megaesophagus is rare.
V Congenital laryngeal paralysis occurs in young Bouvier des
Flandres, Siberian huskies, and other dog breeds. Idiopathic
laryngeal paresis or paralysis may occur in adult Labrador retrievers,
Afghan hounds, Irish setters, and other dog breeds and cats.
Ireatment usually involves some surgical intervention, such as
unilateral thyroarytenoid lateralization, to distract the vocal folds
or partial laryngectomy to open the airway. The most frequent
complication of dysphagia, megaesophagus, and surgery for
laryngeal paralysis is aspiration pneumonia, which can be fatal.
Tongue Paralysis or Atrophy
/ Unilateral tongue paralysis or atrophy from a hypoglossal
nerve (CN 12) lesion with no other neurologic signs is relatively
rare but may be associated with peripheral nerve trauma or
neoplasia. If the animal has no known history of trauma, MRI of
the caudal brainstem area should be considered to rule out
neoplasia, such as neurofibroma, meningioma, and lymphosar.
coma affecting the hypoglossal nerve as it exits the brainstem.
Cranial Polyneuropathies
V Multiple cranial nerves may be dysfunctional in dogs with
acute polyneuropathies (Section 9), chronic polyneuropathies
(Section 10), meningoencephalitis or neoplasia affecting the
brainstem (Section 2), and cranial polyneuropathies (Figure 6-
15). In animals with cranial polyneuropathies, only muscles
associated with cranial nerves are abnormal on the neurologic
examination and EMG. No other underlying polymyopathy,
hypothyroidism, myasthenia gravis, or polyneuropathy is
detected. CSF analysis and MRI are normal and help to rule out
brainstem inflammation or multifocal peripheral nerve
neoplasias, such as lymphosarcoma. Chronic immune-mediated
or paraneoplastic cranial polyneuritis is suspected. Treatment
165
with prednisone with or without azathioprine and gastroin
testinal protectants as described above for masticatory myositis
can be tried. In some cases, there is no response to therapy and
the prognosis is grave.
Figure 6-15 A mixed-breed dog with paralysis of the tongue, unilateral atrophy
of the temporalis and masseter muscles, and facial nerve paralysis on the right
side from granulomatous meningoencephalitis of the pons and medulla; the dog
also had hemiparesis and conscious proprioceptive deficits on the right thoracic
and pelvic limbs.
Dysautonomia
V Dysautonomia is an idiopathic dysfunction of the autonomic
nervous system of dogs and cats that causes dilated pupils that do not
respond to light with normal vision, anisocoria, prolapsed third
eyelids, reduced tear and saliva production, megaesophagus, brady.
cardia, constipation, and urinary incontinence. A Shirmer tear test is
reduced (<15 mm/min). No increased heart rate is observed when
atropine O.02 mg/kg IV is administered. One drop of dilute pilo
carpine (O.1%) will constrict the pupils of an animal with
dysautonomia but not a normal animal. Affected animals may also
have anorexia, weight loss, weakness, and tremors. Reported cases are
primarily from the United Kingdom; sporadic cases have been
reported in the United States in Kansas and Missouri. The diagnosis
is primarily based on the typical clinical signs. Urinary cate-
cholamines are reduced. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
Initially fluid administration and electrolyte replacement therapy may
be necessary. Gastrostomy feeding may be needed to maintain
nutrition. The bladder may have to be expressed every 8 hours, and
laxatives may be given to assist defecation.
166
/ Administration of parasympathomimetic drugs, such as
bethanechol hydrochloride (Urecholine, Merck) 5 to 25 mg PO
every 8 hours in dogs and 2.5 to 5 mg every 8 to 12 hours in cats,
may relieve some of the symptoms. One or two drops of O.5%
physostigmine or 1% pilocarpine ophthalmic preparations in
both eyes every 12 hours may have some systemic effect.
Aspiration pneumonia secondary to megaesophagus and urinary
tract infections require antibiotic therapy. The demeanor and

but the nursing care is so intensive that many owners elect

Central Nervous System
Disorders
V Cranial nerve signs plus unilateral or bilateral conscious
proprioceptive deficits, hemiparesis, or quadriparesis suggests
brainstem disease. Meningoencephalitis, head trauma, cere-
brovascular disorders, and neoplasia are possibilities and are
discussed in Section 2.

Definitions
Pain: An aversive sensory and emotional experience, which
elicits protective motor actions and results in learned avoidance
(Figure 7-1).
Figure 7-1 A 7-year-old chocolate Labrador retriever with an anxious look,
guarding the neck because of pain from anintervertebral disk protrusion at C5-6.
Hyperesthesia: Increased sensitivity to stimulation resulting in a
negative behavioral reaction from the animal.
Hyperpathia: An exaggerated response to painful stimuli.
Paresthesia: Abnormal burning or tingling; often affects limbs
and feet and manifests as self-mutilation.
"Root signature": A sign that a lesion is irritating the nerve
roots to a limb; manifests as reluctance to bear weight on the
limb when standing and lameness or pain of the limb.
Fenestration: A surgical procedure to remove the nucleus
pulposus of the intervertebral disk to prevent future extrusions.
Meningitis: Inflammation of the meninges (i.e., the three
membranes that surround the spinal cord and brain: dura mater,
arachnoid membrane, and pia mater).

Physical and Neurologic
Examinations
V The body temperature may be elevated in diskospondylitis,
spondylitis, and meningitis, but it can also be normal.
V A heart murmur may be auscultated in animals with bacterial
endocarditis that has become a systemic infection and caused
diskospondylitis, spondylitis, or meningitis.
V If the animal is in extreme pain, a complete neurologic exam-
ination may be impossible, but neurologic deficits may be
detected by observing the animal.
Y The evaluation of neck and back pain is outlined in Table 7-1.
V Once the painful area has been localized, the pain should be
controlled as outlined in Table 7-2.
173
Table 7-1.
Evaluation for Neck or Back Pain
Evidence of pain that can be observed
● Depression
·Decreased activity
● Episodes of yelping or loud vocalization
● Head held toward the ground (neck pain)
● Reluctance to move the neck (eyes move without moving the neck)
●Holding one limb flexed when standing (root signature)
●Visible spasms of the neck or back musculature
● Arched back
●Difficulty rising
●Reluctance to jump or climb
●Reluctance to go up or down stairs
·Lameness or stiff gait
Palpation to detect pain
●The patient's neck or back should only be manipulated if a vertebral fracture or
luxation is unlikely
● Pressing on the dorsal spinous processes and squeezing across the transverse
processes or the articular facets may elicit pain in abnormal or very sensitive animals
· Placing one hand on the abdomen of the animal while palpating the paravertebral
approached
● Palpation through the rectum can evaluate for pain of the ventral surface of the
lumbosacral region
●When palpated, the animal may cry out or try to bite, or the paravertebral muscu-
lature may become rigid
● Spasms of the musculature can often be felt
Manipulation
If pain was not found on palpation, the vertebral column may be manipulated.
· Flexion, extension, and turning of the head and neck often elicit increased resist-
ance, pain, and palpable muscle spasms when there are problems in the cervical
region; a normal young animal can touch its nose to its flank without discomfort
limbs can elicit pain in animals with lumbosacral disease
·Lumbosacral pain must be differentiated from hip pain

Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V Vertebal column radiographs if fracture is suspected.
V A complete blood count (CBC) may show neutrophilic leuko-
cytosis in cases of diskospondylitis, spondylitis, and some cases of
meningitis. Fibrinogen levels may be elevated as well.
V Urinalysis may show evidence of a urinary tract infection in
cases of diskospondylitis, and urine culture and antibiotic sensi-
tivity should be performed.
V Blood culture and antibiotic sensitivity may be indicated in
cases of diskospondylitis, spondylitis, and bacterial meningitis.
V A serum chemistry profile may be performed to detect systemic
illness and as part of the preanesthetic evaluation.
V The serum creatine kinase (CK) may be elevated in animals
with polymyositis and other polymyopathies.
V Cytologic evaluation and culture of joint fluid may be useful to
confirm a polyarthritis.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultrasound
are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or abnormalities are found on
the physical examination.
Y The following are tests that are performed under general anes-
thesia; potential findings are also listed:
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show leukocytosis
with or without elevated protein in animals with acute inter-
vertebral disc disease (IVDD), meningitis, and some neoplastic
processes; only elevated protein is noted in cases of IVDD, trau-
ma, and neoplasia.
· An electromyogram (EMG) may show positive sharp waves
and fibrillation potentials in the paravertebral muscles in the
area of a lesion that affects ventral nerve roots.
● Vertebral column radiographs may show vertebral fractures
and luxations, calcified intervertebral disks, diskospondylitis,
spondylitis, atlantoaxial subluxation, spondylosis deformans,
and vertebral neoplasia.
●A myelogram may demonstrate spinal cord compression in
animals with caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy, IVDD, or
some spinal cord neoplasia. Primary spinal cord neoplasia may
cause the spinal cord to appear swollen on the myelogram.
· Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imag
ing (MRI) can be useful to demonstrate intervertebral disk dis-
ease, diskospondylitis, and vertebral and spinal cord neoplasia.
V Serum and CSF immunoassays for specific organisms are
indicated if CSF analysis shows evidence of inflammation.
176
Disorders That Cause
Neck or Back Pain
Degenerative lntervertebral
Disk Disease
Y Degeneration of the intervertebral disk with extrusion or
protrusion of the disk material into the spinal canal is one of the
most common causes of neck and back pain in dogs. The inter-
vertebral disk is situated ventral to the spinal cord and consists
of an inner gelatinous portion, the nucleus pulposus, surrounded
by an outer fibrous ring, the anulus fibrosus (Figure 7-3). Hansen
Type I and Hansen Type II IVDD affect different types of dogs
and often have a different clinical course. In Hansen Type I
IVDD, the nucleus pulposus ruptures through the anulus fibrosus,
extrudes into the vertebral canal or compresses nerve roots, and
causes acute neck or back pain (Figure 7-4). A “root signature,
which is caused by compression of the C6-T2 or L4-S2 nerve
roots by a lateralized disk extrusion, causes lameness or pain in
one thoracic or pelvic limb. The disk may herniate to one side of
the dorsal longitudinal ligament, which lines the floor of the
vertebral canal, causing the limb or limbs of one side to be more
affected than the other.

Nucleus pulposus
Anulus fibrosus
V Hansen Type I IVDD is usually caused by chondroid degener-
ation of the disk. It often affects chondrodystrophic dogs but can
affect other dogs. Dachshunds, Pekingese, pugs, Lhasa apsos,
Shih Tzus, beagles, cocker spaniels, and many other small-breed
dogs are commonly presented for neck and back pain from
Hansen Type I IVDD. The pain associated with this disorder can
be excruciating.
V Hansen Type II IVDD is associated with a fibroid type of disk
degeneration. The nucleus pulposus protrudes through some
annular fibers, while other annular fibers remain intact, hyper-
trophy, and protrude into the spinal canal (Figure 7-5). Hansen
Type II IVDD is more common in older nonchondrodystrophic
dogs with low-grade neck or back pain that slowly worsens over
several weeks or months. The pain associated with Type HI IVDD
is usually mild compared to that of Type I IVDD.
VPain from IVDD without neurologic deficits is more common in
the cervical region than in the thoracolumbar region as the
cervical spinal canal is larger, allowing the spinal cord more space
to avoid compression that might cause ataxia, paresis, or paralysis.
Extrusion or protrusion of disks between T1-T10 is rare, as the
conjugal ligament, which joins the heads of the ribs, reinforces the
region above the disks in this area. Cats rarely have IVDD, but
older cats can have chronic Type II disk protrusion.
178
Figure 7-5
Type Ilintervertebral
disk protrusion.
Anulus fibrosus
Nucleus pulposus
 Calcified disks, narrowed disk spaces, and calcified disk
material in the vertebral canal are often seen on routine
vertebral radiographs in Type I IVDD (Figures 7-6 and 7-7).
However, radiographic abnormalities are rare in type II IVDD.
CSF analysis may be normal or have elevated protein levels with
or without mild leukocytic pleocytosis. Spinal cord compression
is usually absent or minimal on the myelogram of animals with
pain only, but some animals can have significant spinal cord
compression and pain with minimal neurologic dysfunction.
Degenerated disks and disk material in the vertebral canal is best
visualized with CT or MRI (Figures 7-8, 7-9, and 7-1O).
V Acute neck or back pain often responds to medical management
as outlined in Table 7-3. Crate rest for 4 weeks is the most
important part of therapy because if the dog is kept quiet during
the healing process, the extruded disk material can contract away
from nerve roots, relieving the pain without surgical intervention.
V Prednisone can often be discontinued after a few days, but
diazepam may be continued longer. If diazepam is continued for
more than 2 weeks, it should be tapered over several days as
opposed to being discontinued abruptly. Failure to improve with
rest, recurrent episodes of pain, and development of paresis or
paralysis are indications for surgical intervention. Most dogs with
cervical IVDD require surgical removal of the extruded disk
material because of intractable pain.

Table 7-3
Medical Management of Neck and Back Pain from
Intervertebral Disk Disease
1. Strict crate confinement for 4 weeks. Activity is limited to short leash walks with a
harness for urination and defecation; dog can be held on the owner's lap. Collars and
neck restraint are avoided if cervical IvDD is present.
2. Oral diazepam 0.5-2 mg/kg every 6-8 hours as needed, not to exceed 10 mg
every 6 hours to relieve painful muscle spasms.
Warning: If the dog is still in pain or has any weakness, then give
prednisone, which will reduce nerve root and spinal cord irritation or
swelling. Crate confinement is even more critical when prednisone is
given, as pain relief is so complete that the dog may become overactive.
and this can lead to acute paraplegia or quadriparesis.
3. Oral prednisone 0.25-1 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 days, then reduced to every
other day for three doses.
4. Oral famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours, cimetidine
(Tagamet, Smithkline Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours, or misoprostol (Cytotec,
Searle) 1-3 pg/kg every 8 hours may be given to reduce gastrointestinal upset.
5. If further pain control is needed, see Table 7-2
Warning: Owners may try to discontinue crate confinement after a few
days especially when pain is controlled by the diazepam and prednisone
therapy. Impress on the client that failure to confine the dog can delay
healing. cause paralysis from the extrusion of more disk material, and
necessitate expensive surgery.
 With cervical IVDD, the dog is placed in dorsal recumbency and
the disk material is removed through a slot drilled into the two
adjacent vertebral bodies at the site of the extruded disk material
(ventral slot technique, Figure 7-11). With thoracolumbar disk
disease, dogs are placed in sternal recumbency and hemilaminec-
tomy is performed to retrieve the extruded disk material (see
Section 12, Figure 12-6). The prognosis for pain relief is usually
excellent. Since other disks may be in various stages of degenera-
tion and cause future problems, prophylactic fenestration of other
disks near the surgical site is often performed in small dogs. Other
strategies to reduce the chances or effects of future intervertebral
disk herniation are outlined in Table 7-4.

V Antioxidants reduce spinal cord damage from oxygen
containing free radicals, which are produced following an injury.
Vitamin C may cause diarrhea, so a lower dose may be used
initially then slowly increased. High doses of vitamin E may
affect blood coagulation and should be used cautiously in animals
with coagulopathies.
V Although pain is often a feature of the disease, intervertebral
disk extrusion also commonly causes ataxia, hemiparesis, quadri-
paresis, quadriplegia, paraparesis, or paraplegia (Sections 8, 9,10,
12,and 13).
Diskospondylitis and Spondylitis
 Diskospondylitis is a painful infection of the intervertebral
disk and vertebral endplates. Spondylitis, or vertebral
osteomyelitis, is a painful infection of the vertebral body.
Diskospondylitis is more common than spondylitis, and both are
usually caused by a bacterial infection. Fungal infections, such as
aspergillosis, foreign-body migrations (such as grass awns), and
aberrant parasite migrations (such as spirocercosis) occur infre-
quently. Staphylococcus (S) aureus and S.intermedius that arrive
via a hematogenous route are the most frequent bacteria isolated,
although Streptococcus canis, Escherichia coli, Brucella canis, and
other organisms are also cultured. Preexisting or concurrent skin,
urinary tract, or cardiorespiratory infections are often present.
The lumbosacral, thoracolumbar, cervicothoracic, and mid-
thoracic regions are frequently affected. Involvement of multiple
sites iscommon.
 On examination, pyrexia may or may not be present. Sites of
systemic infection should be investigated by performing a
thorough clinical examination accompanied by a CBC, serum
chemistry profile, and urinalysis and urine culture. The CBC may
be normal or show neutrophilic leukocytosis, but fibrinogen is
usually elevated. Cystitis is common, and the bacterial organism
isolated from the urine often also infects the disk and vertebrae.
Fungal hyphae associated with Aspergillus spp. may occasionally
be seen on examination of the urine sediment. Several bacterial
cultures of the blood taken at different intervals may also help
identify the causal organism but are negative more than half of
the time. Serologic testing for Brucella canis is often performed
because of the public health significance of this infection.
Radiographs are used to confirm the diagnosis of diskospondylitis
and spondylitis. Characteristic routine radiographic changes may
184
only be present 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of signs, and
repeated radiographs may be necessary to demonstrate the lesions
in some cases. Radiographic abnormalities include lysis of
adjacent vertebral endplates with collapsed intervertebral disk
spaces or vertebrae. CT or MRI may show lesions earlier and
detail the changes better than routine radiographs (Figures 7-12,
7-13, and 7-14).

tebral disk space from a dog with severe lumbosacral pain.

culture and antibiotic sensitivity. If no culture results are
available, antibiotic combinations of oral trimethoprim-sulfadi-
azine 15-30 mg/kg every 12 hrs and cephalexin (Keflex, Dista)
30 mg/kg every 8 hours may be administered. Other antibiotics
that may be considered include enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer)
5mg/kg PO every 12 hours, ciprofloxacin (Cipro, Bayer) 2.5-5
mg/kg every 12 hours, and clindamycin (Antirobe, Pharmacia &
Upjohn) 5.5-11 mg/kg every 12 hours. Antibiotic therapy
should be continued for 6 to 8 weeks. Pain can be controlled as
described in Table 7-2.
V In animals that are unresponsive to initial therapy, aspirates of the
intervertebral disk space guided by fluoroscopy or ultrasonography
may be useful in deciding treatment. Surgical debridement or decom-
pression is rarely needed unless the animal has paresis or paralysis and
does not respond to therapy. A myelogram, CT, or MRI is needed to
visualize a lesion causing spinal cord compression. The overall
prognosis for bacterial diskospondylitis is very good, but recurrences
have been reported.
V Diskospondylitis due to a fungal infection, such as with Aspergillus
spp., has a grave prognosis. Therapy with oral fluconazole (Diflucan,
Pfizer) 2.5-5.0 mg/kg once daily in dogs or 2.5-10 mg/kg every 12
hours in cats for a minimum of 6 weeks may cause remission of the
for a predisposition to fungal infections in young German shepherds
 and other dogs. As a result, recurrence is likely when antifungal
medications are discontinued.
186
Meningitis
W Meningitis can cause neck or back pain in dogs and cats that
have no other neurologic deficits. Pain may be worse in the
cervical region, but can be multifocal or extend along the entire
vertebral column. Dogs with meningitis are often lethargic,
anorexic, and may or may not be febrile. Neutrophilic leukocy.
tosis may be evident on the CBC, but it may also be normal.
Meningitis is suspected when leukocytic pleocytosis is found on a
CSF analysis. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, rickettsial
organisms and immune-mediated processes may cause meningitis
Specific immunoassays may be performed for many organisms
(Section 2). Bacterial meningitis is suspected if the CSF contains
an increased number of degenerative neutrophils. A gram stain
of the CSF and bacterial culture with antibiotic sensitivity may
assist in confirming the diagnosis and indicate the appropriate
antibiotic therapy. Bacterial meningitis can result from
hematogenous spread of infections located in the endocardium,
uterus, bladder, prostate, or elsewhere in the body or from direct
extension of bacteria from sinus or ear infections, animal bites,
and neurosurgical procedures. Antibiotic therapy for bacterial
infections is discussed in Section 2. The prognosis is often poor,
and epidural abscesses can form. It is rare for other organisms
aside from bacteria to produce only meningitis with neck pain
and no neurologic deficit.
V Neutrophilic leukocytosis (often greater than 10o0 cells/ul)
noted on CSF analysis can also be associated with immune-
mediated meningitis. Necrotizing vasculitis or steroid-responsive
meningitis-arteritis (SRMA) is an immune-mediated necrosis of
meningeal arteries that causes neck pain in beagles, boxers,
Bernese mountain dogs, German shorthaired pointers, and other
dogs younger than 2 years of age. Immune-mediated meningitis
has also been described in older dogs. A few dogs may have
impaired mental status, cranial nerve deficits, seizures, blindness,
ataxia, and paresis (Sections 2,3,5,6 and 8). In some cases of
steroid-responsive meningitis, CSF leukocytosis consists of a
mixture of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Serum
and CSF organism titers should be evaluated to rule out other
causes of meningitis but are usually normal (Section 2).
hours for 2 days, then reduced to 1 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2
weeks, then 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours for 1 month, and then
tapered to alternate-day therapy for 4 to 20 months usually
results in remission. Oral famotidine (Pepcid AC) 0.5-1 mg/kg
every 12 to 24 hours, cimetidine (Tagamet) 5-10 mg/kg every
187
12 hours, or misoprostol (Cytotec) 1-3 μg/kg every 8 hours may
be given to protect the gastrointestinal tract from irritation or
ulceration when the steroid dose is high. Pain may be controlled
as indicated in Table 7-2. Diazepam often relieves muscle spasms
associated with meningitis. With aggressive immunosuppressive
therapy, dogs with SRMA often have a good prognosis for
recovery. Recurrence can occur and may necessitate long-term,
alternate-day therapy once remission has been achieved.
Vertebral Fractures
V Animals with vertebral fractures may present with pain and
no neurologic deficits, but this is more likely in the cervical
region than in the thoracolumbar region. Diagnosis and manage-
ment of vertebral fractures are discussed in Sections 9 and 12.
Lumbosacral Degeneration
 Lumbosacral degeneration, also known as lumbosacral stenosis,
lumbosacral disease, and cauda equina syndrome, causes pain at
the L7-S1 region in German shepherds, German shepherd mixes,
and other large-breed dogs. The degenerative changes include
proliferation of the interarcuate ligament (i.e., the ligament
connecting the vertebrae dorsal to the cauda equina),vertebral
facet osteophyte formation, Type II IVDD and spondylosis
deformans at L7-S1. These degenerative changes cause stenosis of
the vertebral canal and compression of the L7-Cd nerve roots.
V Pain is manifested as low tail carriage; reluctance to wag the
tail; and difficulty rising, climbing stairs, or jumping on furniture
or into the car. Signs of pain may increase after exercise. A flaccid
tail and urinary and fecal incontinence can occur as stenosis and
nerve root compression worsen (Section 15). Proprioceptive
deficits and weakness of one or both pelvic limbs can rarely occur
(Section 13).
 Many dogs have concurrent orthopedic disease of the hips that
causes pain, and careful palpation of the lumbosacral joint alone is
essential. Placing the thumbs on the midline, with fingers on each
ileum, allows the examiner to exert direct pressure over the
lumbosacral articulation without placing stress on the hip joints.
Dorsal flexion of the tail usually elicits pain. Palpation of the
ventral lumbosacral region through the rectum may also be painful.
V Early diagnosis and treatment will help prevent irreversible
urinary and fecal incontinence. Positive waves and fibrillation
potentials may be found on EMG examination of the caudal
lumbar muscles, tail, and anal sphincter. Plain radiographs are
188
often normal (Figure 7-15), or they may show spondylosis
deformans and narrowing of the lumbosacral intervertebral disk
space. Type II IVDD and cauda equina and lateral nerve root
compression are best documented with CT or MRI of the
lumbosacral region (Figure 7-16).
V Acute pain is controlled as described in Table 7-2 for IVDD.
Dorsal laminectomy (see Figure 12-7) and diskectomy are
recommended if pain recurs when medical therapy is discon-
tinued or to avoid progressive compression of nerve roots,
which may result in urinary and fecal incontinence. Crate
confinement as described for IVDD is essential with or without
surgery to prevent pain from recurring. Dogs with pain alone have
 an excellent prognosis for recovery with surgery.

lumbosacral pain showing little evidence of abnormalities

showing a Type ll intervertebral disk protrusion, which may be associated
with early lumbosacral degeneration (arrow).
189
Atlantoaxial Subluxation
V Small dogs with atlantoaxial subluxation due to congenital
abnormalities of the dens and ligaments of C1-2 may be
presented for neck pain alone but are more often presented for
acute quadriparesis or quadriplegia (Section 9).
Caudal Cervical
Spondylomyelopathy
V Caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy may cause neck pain in Great
Danes and Doberman pinschers and other large-breed dogs, but ataxia
and quadriparesis are the most common clinical signs (Section 8).
Spondylosis Deformans
V Spondylosis deformans, also known as hypertrophic spondylosis, is
characterized by formation of ventral and lateral osteophytes that
bridge the intervertebral disk spaces and may cause neck or back
discomfort, especially following excessive exercise or during cold
weather. Spondylosis deformans is often an incidental radiographic
finding that is especially common in the caudal thoracic and lumbar
vertebrae in dogs (Figure 7-17) and occasionally in cats. Degeneration
of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disk is suspected to result
in osteophyte production. Spondylosis deformans rarely causes severe
pain. Oral carprofen, etodolac, or aspirin as described in Table 7-2
can be used to control pain. Osteophytes rarely compress the spinal
cord and nerve roots to cause ataxia or paresis.
Figure7-17Lateralradiographoftheventrolateralbonyproliferationknown
as spondylosis deformans (arrows), which may cause some intermittent discom-
fort but rarely causes severe pain; usually an incidental radiographic finding.
190
Vertebral Neoplasia
V Osteochondromatosis, also known as multiple cartilaginous
exostoses, is the development of proliferative benign masses of
cartilage and bone that arise from metaphyseal growth plates,
often at multiple sites in young animals. Vertebral osteochon-
dromas may cause neck and back discomfort, but most animals
are not presented to a veterinarian until chronic progressive
ataxia, paresis, or paralysis develops (Sections 8, 10, and 13).
V Most neoplasms of the vertebrae are extremely painful.
Osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma,
are the most common types. Vertebral neoplasia often compresses
the spinal cord and causes chronic ataxia and paresis. A patho.
logic fracture of the neoplastic vertebrae occasionally causes
acute quadriparesis, quadriplegia, paraparesis, or paraplegia
V Bony lysis with or without bony proliferation can usually be
seen on plain radiographs of the vertebral column (Figure 7-18),
but CT is superior (Figure 7-19) to visualize vertebral neoplasia.
A myelogram or MRI may show spinal cord compression. A fluo.
roscopic-guided needle aspirate or biopsy of the affected vertebra
may assist in differentiating spondylitis and neoplasia and estab-
lishing a definitive diagnosis.

proliferative bony changes on the dorsal spinous process of T3 (arrow) in a
6-year-old boxer withbackpain.
191
Figure 7-19 Transverse CT of the
T3 vertebra from Figure 7-18
demonstrates the bony prolifera-
tion (arrow) in more detail than
routine radiographs; metastatic
carcinoma was suspected from
the histopathologic examination
of a vertebral biopsy, but the pri-
mary tumor could not be located.
V A limited number of therapeutic options exist for vertebral
neoplasia. A few tumors may respond to chemotherapy, and radiation
therapy may be useful in others. Removal of the affected vertebra may
be attempted in select cases, but for the most part treatment is pallia-
tive. Pain is controlled as outlined in Table 7-2. Dogs and cats with a
vertebral neoplasm generally have a poor prognosis, and increased,
uncontrollable pain often necessitates euthanasia.
Nerve Root and Spinal Cord
Neoplasia
V Neoplasia of the nerve roots, plexus, or individual nerves can cause
pain of the neck, brachial plexus, back, lumbosacral plexus, or cauda
equina. This disorder often manifests as lameness or monoparesis and
is discussed in Section 14. Spinal cord neoplasia can cause neck or
back pain alone, but it more often causes progressive ataxia, paresis, or
paralysis (Sections 8, 10, and 13). Gabapentin (Neurontin, Parke-
Davis) 6-15 mg/kg PO every 6 hours may be tried for nerve pain in
dogs if pain is not controllable by other means. The expense of
gabapentin prohibits its use in many cases.
192
Polymyositis and Other
Polymyopathies
V Polymyositis and other myopathies, such as carnitine polymy.
opathy, are diffuse muscle diseases that may cause neck and back
pain. Concurrent pain is usually found in limb and head muscles.
The diagnosis is confirmed on histologic examination of a muscle
biopsy. Muscle diseases are discussed in Section 11.
Polyarthritis
V Animals with polyarthritis may have neck and back pain but
are usually presented for a stiff and stilted gait. Pain with or
without swelling is found on palpation and manipulation of the
joints of the limbs. The diagnosis is made by demonstration of
inflammatory cells in fluid collected from the joints. Pain may be
controlled with oral carprofen, etodolac, or aspirin as described
in Table 7-2.
√ If immune-mediated polyarthritis is suspected, treatment with
oral prednisone 2 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 days, then reduced
to 1 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 weeks, then 0.5 mg/kg every 12
hours for 1 month, and then tapered to alternate-day therapy for
several months may resolve the clinical signs. Oral famotidine
(Pepcid AC) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12 to 24 hours, cimetidine
(Tagamet) 5-10 mg/kg every 12 hours, or misoprostol (Cytotec)
1-3 μg/kg every 8 hours may be given to protect the gastroin
testinal tract from irritation or ulceration when the steroid dose
is high. Recurrence of immune-mediated polyarthritis is common,
and long-term, alternate-day prednisone may be necessary.
Intracranial Disease
V Brain tumors or other intracranial mass lesions may cause
signs of neck pain. Elevated intracranial pressure, which
stretches small nerve endings in the meninges and blood vessels,
is suspected to radiate pain into the cervical region. CT or MRI
of the brain should be considered in animals with unexplained
cervical pain. Brain tumors are discussed further in Section 2.

limb position that reaches the cerebellum via the spinocerebellar
tracts to provide coordinated movements; tested by observing
coordination of the head and gait.
Conscious proprioception: Sensory information concerning limb
position that travels to the thalamus and parietal cortex to give
Conscious perception of position in space; tested by standing with
the toes knuckled over and observing whether the abnormal
posture is corrected.
Opisthotonus: Dorsal extension of the head and neck
with extension of the thoracic limbs and flexion of the pelvic
limbs; usually associated with acute cerebellar lesions
(decerebellate rigidity).
"Root signature": A sign that a lesion is irritating the nerve
roots to a limb; manifests as reluctance to bear weight on the
limb when standing and lameness or pain of the limb.

200
Physical and Neurologic
Examinations
V Examine the animal carefully for evidence of a systemic disease
process. A careful evaluation is especially important to differentiate
cerebellar and spinal cord disease.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis are performed to detect systemic illness and as part of the
preanesthetic evaluation.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultrasonog-
raphy are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or abnormalities are
found on the physical examination.
V The following are tests that are performed under general anes-
thesia, as well as their potential findings:
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show increased leuko-
meningomyelitis, or central nervous system (CNS) neoplasia
and other spinal cord compressions.
rillation potentials in the paravertebral muscles in spinal cord
lesions that affect ventral nerve roots.
· Vertebral column radiographs may show vertebral fractures
and luxations, calcified intervertebral disks, diskospondylitis,
spondylitis, atlantoaxial subluxation, spondylosis deformans,
and vertebral neoplasia
· A myelogram with dynamic views is useful to evaluate the
instability and ligamentous hypertrophy associated with caudal
cervical spondylomyelopathy.
· A myelogram may also demonstrate spinal cord compression
in animals with intervertebral disk disease, vertebral fracture or
subluxation, diskospondylitis, spinal cord cysts or neoplasia.
The spinal cord may appear swollen on the myelogram in cases
of primary spinal cord neoplasia.
· Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imag
ing (MRI) can be useful to demonstrate cerebellar inflamma
tion, infarction, cysts, neoplasia, or hypoplasia as well as some
degenerative diseases.
● Cerebellar biopsy with histopathologic examination may be
necessary for a definitive diagnosis.
201
· CT and MRI can be useful to demonstrate intervertebral disk
disease, diskospondylitis, cysts and vertebral and spinal cord
neoplasia.
V Serum and CSF immunoassays for infectious diseases are
indicated if there is evidence of inflammation on the CSF analysis.
Cerebellar Disorders
Trauma
V Acute cerebellar trauma is often associated with opisthotonus
(decerebellate rigidity) (Figure 8-4) and preserved consciousness. If
the animal is ambulatory, ataxia of the limbs and head may be noted.
Ataxia often improves over the next 6 to 9 months. Diagnosis and
management of head trauma are discussed in Section 2.
Figure 8-4 A 3-year-old Poodle
with opisthotonus.
Meningoencephalitis
W  Inflammation of the cerebellum associated with infectious
organisms or of unknown causes is considered in dogs and cats of any
age presenting with progressive ataxia of the head and limbs.
Organisms that may cause CNS inflammation in dogs include canine
distemper virus, Ehrlichia canis, Rickettsia rickettsii, Toxoplasma gondii,
Neospora caninum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus spp., and
aerobic or anaerobic bacteria (Section 2, Table 2-8). Organisms that
cause encephalitis in cats include feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)
virus, Toxoplasma gondi, Cryptococcus neoformans, and aerobic or
anaerobic bacteria (Section 2, Table 2-8). Steroid-responsive menin-
goencephalitis, granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, and
202
unclassified viral meningoencephalomyelitis may also produce cere
bellar signs in dogs and cats. CSF analysis and MRI can potentially
support the diagnosis, although a biopsy of the cerebellum may be
necessary in some cases for a definitive diagnosis. Serum and CSF
immunoassays for specific organisms may be performed.
Meningoencephalitis is discussed in Section 2.
Cerebrovascular Disorders
V Hemorrhage or infarction of the cerebellum may be considered in
dogs with acute onset of nonprogressive ataxia and head tremor. CT
or MRI may show the cerebellar lesion or might be normal. The
diagnosis is often suspected but not proven. Improvement of ataxia
often occurs over the following 6 to 9 months. Cerebrovascular
accidents are further described in Section 2.
Intoxication
V Ataxia can occur with most intoxicants that affect the CNS,
such as ethylene glycol, ivermectin, organophosphates, and
pyrethroids, as well as with overdoses of anticonvulsant and
other drugs (Section 2). A thorough history should discuss
possible contact with a toxin, the owner's prescription medica-
tions, illegal substances, and toxic plants. All current
medications or nutritional supplements and herbs should be
evaluated for the potential for toxicity. In humans, cerebellar
degeneration has been associated with overdoses of tricyclic anti-
depressants, diphenylhydantoin, and toxic plants. When in
doubt about whether a substance is poisonous, contact ASPCA
National Animal Poison Control Center (888-426-4435) or
another poison control center.
Neoplasia
V Chronic progressive ataxia of the limbs and head may be asso-
Ciated with cerebellar neoplasia, especially if asymmetric signs
are present. Neoplasia may occasionally produce acute signs
related to hemorrhage or mass effect. Cerebellar neoplasia may
obstruct CSF flow and cause secondary hydrocephalus and signs
of cerebral dysfunction (Section 2). The diagnosis of neoplasia is
made from CSF analysis, MRI, and histologic examination of
tissue obtained from a cerebellar biopsy. Options for treatment of
brain neoplasia are found in Section 2.
203
In-Utero Cerebellar Degeneration
and Hypoplasia
 In-utero degeneration of the cerebellum occurs in both dogs
and cats. The cerebellum continues to develop throughout gestation
and is not completely formed until several days after birth. An
infection or toxic exposure during a critical phase of development
can lead to a loss of neurons in all three layers of the cerebellum.
The signs are apparent when the animal begins to ambulate.
Panleukopenia virus and herpes virus infections are the most
common causes of in-utero cerebellar degeneration in cats and dogs,
respectively. Other dogs and cats may have an incompletely
developed cerebellum or cerebellar hypoplasia that is unassociated
with an infection.
V Ataxia and intention tremors of the head and body are seen as
neonates begin to move. Some cases are mild while others are
severe. In severe cases, walking and eating may be very difficult.
The signs do not change or progress over time. Mildly affected
animals may be acceptable pets but do not improve. CT or MRI
may demonstrate a small cerebellum; a small cerebellum is also
found on necropsy (Figure 8-5). No treatment is available, but
appropriate panleukopenia vaccination of nonpregnant queens is an
effective prevention. Vaccination of pregnant cats with modified
live-virus panleukopenia vaccines has been incriminated as a cause
of the disorder in some cats.

204
Cerebellar Abiotrophy, and Other
Degenerations
V Cerebellar abiotrophy is an inherited disorder associated with
premature death of neurons, which may affect all layers of the
cerebellum. Kerry blue terriers, Gordon setters, collies, and other
purebred dogs and very rarely cats usually develop progressive
ataxia at a young age. The age of onset and speed of progression
varies with each breed. Kerry blue terriers are severely affected
by 1 year of age, but Gordon setters develop signs later. In this
breed, the disease progresses more slowly and they may be
acceptable pets for a longer period. These disorders have tradi-
tionally been diagnosed by histologic examination at necropsy or
with cerebellar biopsy. However, characteristic changes may be
seen on MRI, allowing a presumptive diagnosis in the appropriate
breed. There is no treatment, and most animals progress to a
point where they are incapacitated and have a poor quality of life.

retrievers, Samoyeds, silky terriers, and Egyptian mau cats younger
than 1 year of age. Involvement of other regions of the CNS is
often seen. There is no treatment. The clinical signs may worsen in
Labrador retrievers but improve over time in Egyptian mau cats.
V Several lysosomal storage disorders, such as GM-2 gangliosi-
dosis and sphingomyelinosis, cause progressive ataxia. Lysosomal
storage disorders are outlined in Section 2, Table 2-15. As with
abiotrophies, spongiform degeneration and lysosomal storage
disorders may show characteristic changes on MRI of the brain.
V Late-onset cerebellar degeneration occurs in adult dogs and
progresses slowly over several months to years. Initially, the signs
are restricted to mild ataxia of the pelvic limbs, but all four limbs
and the head become affected insidiously over time. Most diag-
nostic tests are within normal limits, although CT or MRI may
demonstrate a small cerebellum. Histologic examination of a
cerebellar biopsy shows degeneration. The cause is unknown.
Antioxidant therapy with N-acetylcysteine 25 mg/kg PO every 8
hours every other day may delay progression of signs, but affected
dogs ultimately become severely incapacitated. Such animals are
unable to walk without the assistance of a harness and must be
hand fed and watered because head movements are so uncoordi-
nated. Many animals are euthanized because their quality of life
becomes sopoor.
205
Neuroaxonal Dystrophy
/ Neuroaxonal dystrophy (NAD) has been described in
Rottweilers, collies, and cats. Affected Rottweilers develop
insidious progressive ataxia that begins within the first 1 to 2
years of life. Severe ataxia, intention tremors, nystagmus, and
menace deficits eventually develop. The diagnosis is suspected
based on the signalment, clinical signs, and absence of abnormal
findings on CSF analysis and MRI. There is no known
treatment, and the prognosis is poor. Most affected dogs are inca-
pacitated by 6 years of age. Finding axonal spheroids in the
vestibular nuclei and nuclei of the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts
on necropsy supports the diagnosis of NAD. Collies with NAD
show similar signs, but onset occurs at 2 to 4 months of age. At 5
to 6 weeks of age, tricolor cats begin with head tremors and
progress to ataxia. An autosomal recessive inheritance is
suspected in dogs.
Brain Cysts
V Epidermoid, dermoid, and arachnoid cysts may rarely affect
the cerebellum and produce progressive neurologic signs. The
cysts are visualized on CT and MRI. Surgical removal or
drainage of the cyst from the cerebellum can be attempted.
These cysts can also cause progressive compression of the spinal
cord and are discussed in Section 13.
Spinal Cord Disorders
Degenerative Intervertebral Disk
Disease
V Ataxia of all four limbs or the pelvic limbs only is commonly
caused by Type I and Type II degenerative intervertebral disk
disease (IVDD) (Section 7). Some degree of quadriparesis is also
usually present, and this is discussed further in Section 9. The
diagnosis and medical treatment of IVDD are described in
Sections 7 and 9.
V Ataxia associated with Type I IVDD may resolve with crate
rest, diazepam, and prednisone (Section 7, Table 7-3). Ataxia
associated with Type II IVDD often improves with prednisone
but recurs when medication is reduced or discontinued. If quadri-
paresis develops or ataxia returns when the medication is
206
discontinued, then surgical decompression via a ventral slot
(Section 7, Figure 7-11), dorsal laminectomy, or hemilaminec-
tomy (Section 12, Figures 12-6 and 12-7) is performed.
Caudal Cervical
Spondylomyelopathy
V Caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy (CCSM), also known as
cervical vertebral malformation, cervical vertebral instability,
and wobbler's syndrome, occurs in both young and old large-
breed dogs. A malformation and malarticulation of the cervical
vertebrae, which can be exacerbated by a high-protein diet,
causes stenosis of the vertebral canal in young dogs. In older
dogs, joint instability with hypertrophy of the associated
ligaments and Type II IVDD cause stenosis of the vertebral
canal. CCSM affects the caudal cervical vertebrae from C4-C7.
Although many large-breed dogs are affected, 1 to 2-year-old
Great Danes and 5 to 10-year-old Doberman pinchers are most
commonly affected.
V Onset of clinical signs can be acute or slow and insidious.
Ataxia is present in all four limbs, although the pelvic limbs
often seem affected to a greater extent. The pelvic limbs
circumduct during ambulation, and the hips wobble from side to
side. The thoracic limb deficits are often misconstrued as
compensation for the pelvic limb ataxia, and a lesion below T2
may be initially suspected. However, on closer examination, a
stiff, stilted, short-strided gait is observed on the thoracic limbs.
Atrophy or fasciculation of the deltoideus, biceps, and infra-
spinatus and supraspinatus muscles may be present. A "root
signature" may be apparent. Conscious proprioceptive deficits
may be seen in the pelvic limbs alone or in all four limbs. One
side may be more affected than the other. Some degree of neck
pain can usually be elicited by palpation and neck manipulation,
although this is often subtle. Some dogs are presented for acute
nonambulatory quadriparesis (Section 9).
W In young dogs, vertebral malformation and a stenotic
vertebral canal may be obvious on routine cervical radiographs,
but a myelogram with lateral and ventrodorsal views is essential
to appreciate the location and extent of the spinal cord compres-
sion. Narrowed disk spaces, calcified disks, a narrowed vertebral
canal, spondylosis deformans, and arthritis in the dorsal articular
facets may be seen on routine cervical radiographs in older dogs.
CSF analysis is usually within normal limits, although some cases
have mild leukocytosis (7-10 cells/ul; normal = 6 cells or less) or
elevated protein (25-35 mg/ml; normal = less than 20).
207
WDiagnosis of CCSM is confirmed with myelography. Lateral
compression may be obvious on ventrodorsal views. Dorsal spinal cord
     g a  s
articular facets may be found. Ventral compression from Type II
IVDD and hypertrophy of the dorsal longitudinal ligament is seen on
a lateral myelogram without traction (Figure 8-6). If traction is
applied, ventral compression may be reduced (Figure 8-7). As CCSM
is a dynamic lesion, mildly flexed and extended views are important
to appreciate the effects of different neck postures on the spinal cord
compression. If spinal cord compression is alleviated with flexion and
accentuated on extension, the problem is partially caused by ligamen
tous hypertrophy ventrally. If flexion and extension do not affect the
lesion, Type II IVDD alone is most likely. Compression may be found
at more than one site.
Figure 8-6 Lateral myelogram showing ventral compression of the spinal cord
at C5-C6 and C6-C7 in a 7-year-old Doberman pinscher with caudal cervical
spondylomyelopathy (arrows).
Figure 8-7 Lateral myelogram with neck traction of the dog in Figure 8-6
showing reduction of the compression at both sites (arrows).
208
V Dynamic studies using MRI are more difficult than with myel
ography. Myelography accompanied by CT imaging can provide
more information about some lesions, particularly those in young
dogs with bony malformations and encroachment of the facets
into the neural canal. The degree of spinal cord atrophy may be
assessed with CT or MRI.
V Mildly affected dogs will improve on prednisone 0.25 mg/kg
PO every 12 hours and oral muscle relaxants, such as diazepam
0.5-2 mg/kg PO every 6 to 8 hours as needed (not to exceed 10
mg every 6 hours). Acupuncture may also help relieve the pain.
Ataxia often returns if prednisone is discontinued.
in most cases. The type of surgery depends on whether the spinal
cord compression is dorsal, lateral, or ventral and if hypertrophy of
the dorsal longitudinal ligament is present. If dorsal or lateral spinal
cord compression is present, then a dorsal laminectomy (Section
12, Figure 12-7) over one or more sites may be necessary.
 A ventral slot technique may achieve decompression if only a
Type II IVDD is present (Section 7, Figure 7-11). If dorsal longi-
tudinal ligamentous hypertrophy and vertebral instability are
present, then a ventral decompression with vertebral distraction
and fusion are recommended. The distraction-fusion technique
(Figure 8-8) involves separation of the vertebrae with an implant
device (polypropylene ring or metal washer) and fixation in this
distracted position with orthopedic screws, wires, or pins. If more
than one site of compression is seen on the myelogram, the
distraction-fusion technique may be performed at several sites at
the same time.

spacers and screws for caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy in the same dog as
in Figures 8-6 and 8-7.
209
room for 4 weeks, and the neck is supported with a light brace
and bandage. The dog's activity level is then gradually returned
to normal. The prognosis for most dogs with surgical interven-
tion is very good. Most patients will recover to 80% of normal in
the first 3 months but will continue to improve for 9 to 12
months. Because of increased stress on the vertebrae adjacent to
the fused vertebrae, Type II IVDD may occur on either side of
the surgical site several months or years following the initial
surgery (the "domino effect").
Trauma
V Spinal cord trauma most commonly causes acute quadri-
paresis, paraparesis or paraplegia along with ataxia and is
discussed in Section 9.
Meningomyelitis
V Most of the inflammatory diseases of the brain discussed in
Section 2 can also cause focal cervical or thoracolumbar lesions,
or multifocal spinal cord disease. Meningomyelitis or myelitis can
occasionally present as ataxia with or without pain and paresis.
Diagnosis is based on finding leukocytic pleocytosis and elevated
protein levels in the CSF. CSF collected from the lumbar
subarachnoid space may have higher leukocyte counts and
protein levels than that of the cerebellomedullary cistern due to
the caudal flow of CSF. Serum and CSF immunoassays for
specific organisms may help to identify causative agents. An
inflammatory focus may be visible on MRI. Treatment of nervous
system inflammation is discussed in the meningoencephalitis
section of Section 2, Tables 2-10 and 2-11.
Diskospondylitis
V Neck or back pain is the most common initial clinical sign of
diskospondylitis. If left untreated, progressive ataxia can result
from spinal cord compression due to inflammation and swelling
of the intervertebral disk and surrounding tissues. The diagnosis
and treatment of diskospondylitis are discussed in Section 7.
Atlantoaxial Subluxation
V Mild atlantoaxial subluxation from agenesis or hypogenesis of the
dens may cause ataxia of the limbs in toy breed dogs younger than 1
year of age, but acute quadriparesis is most common. Atlantoaxial
subluxation is discussed in Section 9.
210
Neoplasia
V Vertebral osteochondromas are proliferative benign masses of
cartilage and bone at metaphyseal growth plates; these masses
compress the spinal cord in dogs and cats, causing chronic
progressive ataxia and paresis. Other types of vertebral and spinal
cord neoplasia occasionally produce ataxia of all four limbs or
only the pelvic limbs. Spinal cord tumors often cause chronic
progressive quadriparesis and paraparesis along with ataxia, and
diagnosis and treatment of such tumors are discussed in Sections
10 and 13.
Spinal Cord Cysts
V Depending on their location, epidermoid and arachnoid cysts
may compress the spinal cord and cause progressive ataxia of all
four limbs or only the pelvic limbs in dogs and cats. Progressive
quadriparesis or paraparesis usually occurs. These cysts are
discussed in Section 13.
Sensory Nerve Disorders
Sensory Polyneuropathy
V Ataxia may be caused by a generalized disorder of sensory
peripheral nerves. Conscious proprioceptive deficits, hypesthesia,
paresthesia, anesthesia, and self-mutilation may also be present
due to the involvement of other senses. Sensory polyneuropathy
may be suspected after other causes of ataxia have been ruled
out, as these disorders are very rare. No response to electrical
stimulation of sensory nerves is found on an EMG examination.
The possibility of toxicity should be explored historically. An
idiopathic sensory ganglioneuritis and congenital sensory
polyneuropathy have been described in dogs.

Acute quadriparesis, quadriplegia, hemiparesis, and hemi-
plegia: Onset of signs over a 24 to 72-hour period.
Quadriparesis (tetraparesis): Weakness (paresis) in all four limbs,
which can be mild (ambulatory), moderate (nonambulatory, sternal
recumbency) (Figure 9-1), or severe (nonambulatory, lateral recum-
bency), but some voluntary limb movement is retained; most
ambulatory animals with quadriparesis from spinal cord lesions also
show ataxia and conscious proprioceptive deficits.
Quadriplegia (tetraplegia): Loss of voluntary movements in all
four limbs.
Hemiparesis: Weakness of the thoracic and pelvic limbs on
one side.
Hemiplegia: Loss of voluntary movements of the thoracic and
pelvic limbs on one side.
Flaccid or lower motor neuron paresis or paralysis: Paresis or
paralysis with reduced or absent spinal reflexes in one or more limbs.
Spastic or upper motor neuron paresis or paralysis: Paresis or
paralysis with normal or increased spinal reflexes in one or
more limbs.
“Root signature": A sign that a lesion is irritating the nerve
roots to a limb; manifests as reluctance to bear weight on the
limb when standing and lameness or pain of the limb.

214
Fenestration: A surgical procedure to remove the nucleus
pulposus of the intervertebral disk to prevent future extrusions.
Neuromuscular system: The peripheral nerves, neuromuscular
junctions, and muscles.
Polyradiculoneuritis: Inflammation of many nerve roots and
peripheral nerves.
Decubital ulcer: A deep wound with sloughing skin and muscle;
occurs over bony prominences due to constant pressure from lying in
one position too long; often the bone is exposed.
Syringomyelia: Fluid-filled cavitation of the spinal cord resulting
from trauma, infarction, or unknown cause (most often causes
chronic quadriparesis).
Meningomyelitis: Inflammation of the meninges and spinal cord.
Myelitis: Inflammation of the spinal cord.
Lesion Localization
V The location of lesions that cause acute quadriparesis, quadri-
plegia, hemiparesis or hemiplegia is shown in Figure 9-2. These
lesions are usually found in the:
· Focal cervical and cranial thoracic spinal cord (Cl-T2)
● Multifocal cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord (C1- L7)
· Generalized neuromuscular system (peripheral nerves, neu-
romuscular junctions and muscles)
215

generalized neuromuscular lesion (dots indicate lesion localization).
Differentiation of Spinal
Cord and Neuromuscular
Lesions
V Figure 9-3 is an algorithm to assist in differentiating spinal cord
and neuromuscular lesions.
C1-C5 Spinal Cord Lesions
V If crossed extensor reflexes are present in the thoracic limbs
and pelvic limb spinal reflexes are normal or hyperactive, then
the lesion is localized to C1-C5.
V If the spinal reflexes of all four limbs are normal or if thoracic
limb spinal reflexes are normal and the pelvic limb spinal reflexes
are hyperactive, the lesion could be at either C1-C5 or C6-T2.
V May have unilateral Horner's syndrome on the side of
the lesion.

C6-T2 Spinal Cord Lesions
V If the lesion affects most of the C6-T2 region, the flexor
reflexes of the thoracic limbs are reduced or absent, and the
spinal reflexes in the pelvic limbs are normal or exaggerated.
V If the lesion affects only part of the C6-T2 region, the flexor
reflexes of the thoracic limbs may still be normal, and this
lesion cannot be distinguished from a C1-C5 lesion.
V May have unilateral Horner's syndrome on the side of
the lesion.
V May have loss of cutaneous trunci response on the side of
the lesion.
Neuromuscular Lesions
V Decreased or absent thoracic and pelvic limb spinal reflexes.

Diagnostic Evaluation
Important Historical Questions
· Acute onset (i.e., over 24 to 72 hours)?
· Progressive or nonprogressive?
● Possibility of recent trauma? If so, obtain vertebral
radiographs before proceeding further.
· Is the neck painful?
● Have there been past episodes of quadriparesis?
● Past or present urinary or fecal incontinence?
● Can the animal urinate voluntarily?
· Are there signs of anorexia, depression, regurgitation, coughing,
respiratory distress, or other systemic illness?
● Possible exposure to ticks, raccoons, snakes or dead carrion?
· Recent vaccination?
· Current or recent medications?
218
Physical and Neurologic
Examinations
V Evaluate respiration; mucous membrane color; heart rate,
rhythm, and pulse; and give emergency treatment if needed.
V Examine the ocular fundus for chorioretinitis.
V Examine for evidence of other systemic disease or neoplasia.
V Differentiate spinal cord from neuromuscular lesions.
V Examine the animal for a tick or a bite wound if a neuromuscular
lesion suspected.
V Is Horner's syndrome present? (suggests a C-T: spinal
cord disorder)
V Are one or more cranial nerves affected? (suggests a
neuromuscular disorder)
V Determine whether the animal is in pain.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis are performed to detect systemic illness and as part of the
preanesthetic evaluation.
V Serum acetylcholine receptor antibody test will be elevated in
mysthenia gravis.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultrasonog-
raphy are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or abnormalities are
found on the physical examination.
V The following are tests that are performed under general anes-
thesia, as well as their potential findings:
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show leukocytosis
with or without elevated protein in acute intervertebral disk
disease, meningitis, and some neoplastic processes, or elevated
protein may be present only in intervertebral disk disease, fibro
cartilaginous embolism trauma, and neoplasia.
● Vertebral column radiographs may show vertebral fractures and
luxations, calcified intervertebral disks, atlantoaxial subluxation,
and vertebral neoplasia
● A myelogram with dynamic views is useful to evaluate the
instability and ligamentous hypertrophy associated with caudal
cervical spondylomyelopathy.
· A myelogram may also demonstrate spinal cord compression
in animals with intervertebral disk disease, vertebral fracture or
219
subluxation or spinal cord neoplasia. Primary spinal cord
neoplasia may cause the spinal cord to appear swollen on
the myelogram.
· Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) can be useful to demonstrate intervertebral disk
disease, hemorrhage, syringomyelia and vertebral and spinal
cordneoplasia.
· An electromyogram (EMG), including needle EMG, motor
nerve conduction velocity, repetitive nerve stimulation, and
F-waves, is performed to determine if a diffuse neuromuscular
disease is present and if the lesion is in the peripheral nerve,
neuromuscular junction, or muscle.
· Histologic examination of a muscle and nerve biopsy can
confirm and characterize lesions.
V Serum and CSF immunoassays for infectious diseases are
indicated if CSF analysis shows evidence of inflammation.
Spinal Cord Disorders
Degenerative Intervertebral
Disk Disease
V Acute quadriparesis or quadriplegia commonly occurs in dachs-
hunds, Pekingese, Lhaso apsos, beagles, cocker spaniels, Shih Tzus,
and many other small-breed dogs and some large-breed dogs from
acute Type I intervertebral disk extrusion. Degenerated nucleus
pulposus ruptures through the anulus fibrosus of the intervertebral
disk into the vertebral canal, traumatizing and compressing the spinal
cord (Section 7, Figure 7-4). Dogs that are ambulatory often have a
"root signature” in one thoracic limb caused by compression of the
C6-T2 nerve roots by a lateralized disk extrusion.
V A narrowed disk space and calcified disk material in the vertebral
canal are often found on cervical vertebral radiographs (Figure 9-4).
Increased protein levels and occasionally mild leukocytic pleocytosis
are found on CSF analysis. Cervical myelography with or without CT
can be performed to confirm the site of spinal cord compression.
V MRI can also be useful to visualize degenerating disks and spinal
cord compression (Figures 9-5 and 9-6). Common sites of disk
extrusion include C2-C3 in small-breed dogs and C5-C6 or C6-C7
in Doberman pinschers, Rottweilers, German shepherds, boxers,
and other large-breed dogs, although involvement of any cervical
disk is possible.

MRI of the dog in Figure 9-5 showing
a Type I disk extrusion that is more
prominent on the right than on the
left (arrow).
221
/ If quadriparesis is mild and the dog is ambulatory, then
medical management can be tried as outlined in Table 91.
Aggressive steroid therapy as described in Table 9-3 for spinal
cord injuries is usually unnecessary for cervical disk extrusion, as
quadriplegia is rare.
Y Although many dogs respond to medical therapy, those that
do not respond or are unable to walk require surgery to remove
the extruded disk material in order to relieve spinal cord
compression. A ventral slot technique is most commonly
performed (Section 7, Figure 7-11). Prophylactic fenestration of
other disks in the area at the time of surgery may help to prevent
further recurrence of the disease at another disk space in small
dogs. The prognosis for return to normal function with surgery is
usually excellent.
V Proper nursing care of quadriplegic and nonambulatory hemi-
can be very time-consuming and difficult in large-breed dogs, but
it is essential to prevent complications and assist in recovery.
Pneumonia can be a fatal complication, so the dog must be
turned and respiration and body temperature monitored.
Table 9-1
Medical Management of Ambulatory Dogs with Mild
Quadriparesis from Cervical Disk Disease
· Strict crate confinement for 4 weeks (activity is limited to short leash walks
with a harness for urinating and defecating)
● Oral prednisone 0.25-1 mg/kg every 12 hours with tapered doses over 7-14
days is given to reduce spinal cord swelling from compression. If the animal
improves then relapses as the dose is reduced, increase prednisone dose again and
recommend surgery.
● Oral famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours, cimeti-
dine (Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours, 0r misoprostol
(Cytotec, Searle) 1-3 pg/kg every 8 hours may be given to reduce gastrointestinal
upset when the prednisone dose is high.
● Oral diazepam 0.5-2 mg/kg every 6-8 hours as needed (not to exceed 10
mg every 6 hours) may help relieve painful muscle spasms.
Ifpain issevere,seeSection 7.Table 7-2
Warning: Prednisone therapy oten causes polyuria/polydipsia, polypha-
gia, and panting. Give extra water, and feed smaller amounts of a high-
quality, low-calorie diet, as quadriparetic dogs can only minimally exercise.
Long term corticosteriod therapy can cause gastrointestinal ulcers.
hepatopathy. and myopathy
222
V Decubital ulcers are avoided by turning and keeping the dogs
on a clean, padded surface. Dermatitis can occur secondary to
irritation from urine and contamination from feces so cleanliness
is essential. The bladder should be expressed so excessive disten-
tion does not damage the bladder wall. Most dogs will defecate
reflexively, but an enema or stool softener may be needed if they
become constipated.
V Assistance in drinking is important to avoid dehydration, and
a balanced diet ensures good nutritional support and subsequent
healing. Physical therapy is needed to reduce muscle atrophy and
tendon contracture. The prognosis for recovery of quadriparetic
dogs following surgery is usually excellent, but recovery may take
several weeks or months. Advice to owners concerning strategies
to prevent recurrence of problems associated with cervical disk
disease is outlined in Section 7, Table 7-4.
Table 9-2
Nursing Care and Physical Therapy for Quadriplegic and
Nonambulatory Hemiparetic and Quadriparetic Dogs
●Keep on a clean, padded surface, and turn to the opposite side every 4-6 hours.
●Monitor for cough, increased lung sounds, and respiratory distress twice
daily (pneumonia).
·Monitor for fever twice daily.
●Express bladder every 6-8 hours if unable to urinate.
●Use enemas or stool softeners to assist with defecation if necessary.
· Keep skin dry and free of urine and feces (apply water-repellent ointment to
perineal and caudal abdominal areas)
· Artificial tears or ophthalmic lubricant ointment may be needed if the palpebral
reflex is absent.

Table 9-3
Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate Therapy
for Acute Quadriplegia
Acute quadriplegia presented within 8 hours of onset:
● Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) 30 mg/kg IV. (Refer immediately
for emergency surgical decompression if the animal is stable.)
● Two hours after the initial dose, MPss 15 mg/kg IV is given and repeated every
6 hours for 24-48 hours if voluntary movement is still absent
● To prevent gastrointestinal complications, give IV famotidine (Pepcid AC) 0.5-1
mg/kg every 12-24 hours or cimetidine (Tagamet) 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours
Acute quadriplegia presented after 8 hours but within 24 hours of onset:
●MPSS 15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 24 hours. (Refer for emergency surgical
decompression after the first dose if the animal is stable.)
Warnings
● Do not use MpsS at higher doses, in ambulatory animals, or if the
patient presents more than 24 hou rs after the onset of injury. as the
pathologic condition may be worsened.
● Stop treatment if melena or vomiting occurs.
Caudal Cervical
Spondylomye
velopathy
V Dogs with caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy (CCSM) may
occasionally present with acute quadriparesis or quadriplegia
associated with rapid extrusion of an intervertebral disk. Most
dogs with CCSM are initially presented because of ataxia or
chronic progressive quadriparesis (Sections 8 and 10).
Trauma
% Cervical vertebral fractures, subluxation or luxation, and
traumatic intervertebral disk herniation can cause acute quadri-
paresis or quadriplegia due to hemorrhage and compression of the
cervical spinal cord. If trauma is known or suspected, manipulation
of the cervical vertebrae and head during physical and neurologic
examinations is avoided. It should not be assumed that animals
with minimal neurologic deficits do not have serious spinal injuries.
Dogs and cats with spinal fractures or luxations may be ambulatory
and have neck pain with little or no neurologic impairment
(Section 7), but manipulation of the neck can cause the vertebrae
to collapse, resulting in subsequent quadriplegia.
224
neurons controlling respiration can lead to hypoventilation, respi-
ratory paralysis, hypoxia or death. Assisted ventilation and oxygen
therapy may be needed. Aside from the immediate traumatic
damage to the spinal cord, induction of secondary neurotoxic
processes results in formation of oxygen containing free radicals
and a cycle of progressive spinal cord destruction that continues
over 24 to 48 hours. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS)
may be given to dogs and cats with quadriplegia to attempt to
reduce spinal cord damage as outlined in Table 9-3. The antioxi-
dant properties of this agent have been shown in experimental
animals to reduce spinal cord destruction if given intravenously in
a specific dose range within 8 hours of the onset of paralysis.
% The MPSS regimen is not given to dogs that can move
voluntarily. Giving a higher-than-recommended dose of MPSS or
beginning treatment more than 24 hours after the onset of quad-
riplegia may worsen the spinal cord damage. Surgical
decompression within the first 24 hours has the optimal effect, so
emergency referral after the first initial dose of MPSS is recom-
mended if the animal is stable.A few dogs and cats with severe
spinal cord injury can develop ascending myelomalacia and die
from respiratory paralysis regardless of therapy.
 Corticosteroids at high doses can cause gastrointestinal (GI)
irritation and lead to life-threatening ulceration and pancreatitis,
so the use of drugs to protect the GI tract is highly recommended.
V Dexamethasone has not been shown to have the same neuro.
protective effects as MPSS.
V Radiographs of the vertebral column should be obtained as
soon as possible with the animal immobilized on a rigid surface,
such as a radiolucent plastic board, to prevent movement and
further spinal cord injury. Radiographs of the cervical, thoracic,
and lumbar vertebrae should be obtained to identify multiple
fracture sites. Fractures and luxations are usually obvious on
plain radiographs, although occasionally an unstable subluxation
may be viewed in the normal position. Fractures of the axis (C2)
are seen most commonly, and this region should be evaluated
carefully. The degree of spinal cord compression and swelling can
be seen with a myelogram. CT and MRI can be useful to
visualize hemorrhage within the spinal canal, additional
compression remote from the obvious injury, and spinal cord
edema; they may be especially helpful when no radiographic
lesionsareseen.
225
 If there is significant hemorrhage, bone fragments, or other
space-occupying lesions within the spinal canal, then surgical
decompression of the spinal cord through a ventral slot or dorsal
laminectomy may be necessary. Vertebral fractures or luxations
are stabilized with Steinmann pins or orthopedic screws and poly
methyl methacrylate (Section 12, Figures 12-9 and 12-10). Pain is
controlled as outlined in Section 7, Table 7-2. Postoperative nursing
care and physical therapy are outlined in Table 9-2.
/ Trauma can damage vertebral arteries causing hemiparesis, quadri-
paresis, or quadriplegia with no vertebral fractures or instability or
spinal cord compression. Recovery is possible with strict crate
confinement for a minimum of 4 weeks and nursing care as outlined
in Tables 9-1 and 9-2. Animals with cervical spinal cord trauma ofter
have a good chance of making a functional recovery and usually have
a better prognosis than those with thoracolumbar injuries. Caudal
cervical spinal cord injury can cause damage to neuronal cell bodies
and nerve roots, and recovery can be slow and incomplete in one or
both thoracic limbs.
Fibrocartilaginous Embolism
 Fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE) and infarction of the
spinal cord is the most common vascular disorder of dogs. Young,
large-breed dogs, miniature schnauzers, and very rarely cats are
presented with acute asymmetric quadriparesis, hemiparesis, or
hemiplegia. Asymmetric paraparesis with paralysis of one pelvic
limb is also common with FCE of the thoracic and lumbar spinal
cord (Section 12). Infarction of the spinal cord results from
occlusion of either spinal arteries or veins with fibrocartilage.
The origin of the fibrocartilage is unknown, although most
theories suggest that it arises from degenerating intervertebral
disk material, which gains entrance to the spinal cord vascula-
ture. The route of entrance is still speculative.
 A history of acute collapse with or without vigorous exercise
is common. The clinical signs may worsen within the first few
hours but are usually nonprogressive by the time veterinary help
is obtained. Initially, the animal may be painful, but this usually
passes in a few hours and pain is usually not evident on palpation
of the neck. If the lesion involves the caudal cervical region,
hyporeflexia or areflexia of one or both thoracic limbs and
possibly Horner's syndrome or loss of the cutaneous trunci reflex
may be observed. With severe infarctions, respiratory compro-
mise may be evident. The diagnosis is typically one of exclusion,
226
although an acute, nonprogressive, nonpainful, asymmetric
paresis or paralysis in a young, large-breed dog is highly sugges-
tive of FCE. An overview of the diagnostic criteria and
treatment for FCE in dogs is outlined in Table 9-4.
Y In severe cases of quadriparesis, ventilatory support and
oxygen therapy may be needed. After 24 hours, prednisone 0.25
to 1 mg/kg PO every 12 hours with doses tapered doses over 7 to
14 days may be given.
 If quadriparesis is symmetric or remains severe, CSF analysis
can rule out meningomyelitis, while myelography and other
imaging techniques may demonstrate spinal cord swelling or are
normal with no evidence of spinal cord compression. MRI may
show evidence of intramedullary edema. Evaluation of appro-
priate blood tests can help to rule out coagulopathy or other
factors predisposing to thrombus formation. The prognosis for
this disease is excellent, and functional recovery can usually be
achieved in all but the most severely affected dogs. One thoracic
limb may remain weaker than the other.
Table 9-4
Diagnostic Criteria and Treatment for Cervical
Fibrocartilaginous Embolism in Dogs
● Pelvic limb spinal reflexes are normal or hyperactive; thoracic limb reflexes are
normal, hyperactive, depressed, or absent
● Horner's syndrome may be present on the same side as the most-affected limbs
· Treatment is with IV methylprednisolone sodium succinate 15

0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours or cimetidine (Tagamet) 5-10
mg/kg every 8 hours for 24 hours
● On re-evaluation in 12-24 hours, the dog may be ambulatory with assistance
with hemiplegia or hemiparesis still present
nursing care (Table 9-2)
● May opt for myelography or MRl which is normal or shows mild spinal cord
swelling and edema
● Most dogs become functional pets again in 2-6 weeks
227
Meningomyelitis
V The same inflammatory diseases of the brain discussed in
Section 2 can affect the spinal cord. Meningomyelitis or myelitis
can cause acute quadriparesis with or without cervical pain. The
diagnosis is suspected by finding leukocytic pleocytosis and
elevated protein levels on CSF analysis. CSF from the lumbar
subarachnoid space may have a higher leukocyte count and
protein content than that of the cerebellomedullary cistern due
to the caudal flow of CSF. An inflammatory focus may be visible
on MRI. Serum and CSF immunoassays for specific organisms
may be performed. The diagnosis and treatment of infections and
other inflammations are discussed in the meningoencephalitis
section of Section 2 (Tables 2-8, 2-9, 2-10, and 2-11).
Atlantoaxial Subluxation
V Atlantoaxial (C1-C2) subluxation is usually associated with
agenesis or hypogenesis of the dens and surrounding ligaments in
toy-breed dogs younger than 1 year of age. On occasion, a
seemingly insignificant traumatic event, such as falling off the
furniture or playing with another animal, will cause subluxation
in dogs that are a few years old. Periodic syncope-like episodes
have been noted, presumably from an abnormal dens
compressing the ventrally located basilar artery, which reduces
the blood flow to the brain. Acute subluxation can cause severe
spinal cord injury.
V Pain is usually elicited in the high cervical region on cervical
palpation. Ataxia of all four limbs, quadriparesis of varying
degrees, or quadriplegia is present, and the thoracic limbs are
often worse than the pelvic limbs. Spinal reflexes are normal to
hyperactive, and crossed extensor reflexes may be present in all
four limbs. The diagnosis can usually be made with a lateral radi
ograph of the cervical spine, which shows an abnormal
separation of the dorsal arch of the atlas and the dorsal spinous
process of the axis (Figure 9-7). Slight flexion of the neck can
occasionally facilitate this observation, although this must be
done with extreme caution in anesthetized animals with an
intact dens to avoid further spinal cord injury. Myelography can
confirm the compression but is usually not necessary.
Syringomyelia may occur secondarily and can be seen with MRI.
Y The treatment of choice is ventral surgical fusion of the
atlantoaxial joint. Stabilization with Steinmann pins or orthopedic
228

quadriparesis from atlantoaxial

screws and polymethylmethacrylate is usually effective (Figures 9-8
and 9.9). A neck brace is also used for 4 to 6 weeks in dogs after
surgery and in those with pain and ataxia only. Crate confinement
and the treatment outlined in Table 9.1 for cervical disk disease are
also suggested. Postoperative nursing care is easier with toy-breed
dogs and is outlined in Table 9.2. The prognosis for functional
recovery following surgery is usually fair to good.
% Without surgical fusion, recurrence of quadriparesis and
potentially severe spinal cord injury is common.

luxation; pins, screws, and polymethylmethacrylate were placed ventrally to

atlantoaxial subluxation in Figure 9-8.
229
Neoplasia
V Neoplasia of the vertebrae, nerve roots, meninges, or spinal
cord can result in acute quadriplegia if these conditions cause
hemorrhage, ischemia or pathologic fractures. However, most
animals with neoplastic conditions have neck pain or chronic
progressive ataxia and quadriparesis (Sections 7, 8, and 10).
Spontaneous Hemorrhage
V Spontaneous hemorrhage within the spinal canal or spinal cord
causing acute quadriparesis unassociated with trauma, intervertebral
disk extrusion, or neoplasia is rare but may occur secondary to
thrombocytopenia, von Willebrand's disease, or other coagu
lopathies. For unknown reasons, greyhounds seem to be at increased
risk for spontaneous spinal cord hemorrhage. Evaluation of platelet
counts, coagulation parameters, and bleeding function tests may
identify an underlying disorder. Thrombocytopenia and other coagu
lopathies must be treated before invasive tests or surgery are
performed. If it is safe to collect CSF, hemorrhage, xanthochromia,
or erythrophagocytosis by neutrophils or macrophages may be
observed. Spinal cord compression from a suspected hematoma may
be observed on myelography, CT, or MRI; however, the imaging
characteristics of hemorrhage are complex, and definitive diagnosis
can be difficult. A hematoma may be surgically removed to decom
press the spinal cord in some cases. Improvement and recovery are
often possible even without surgery, although the recurrence of
hemorrhage is a concern if the underlying problem is not corrected.
Syringomyelia
V Syringomyelia of the cervical spinal cord is a rare cause of
acute quadriplegia. The syrinx (fluid-filled cavity) is found
within the spinal cord on the myelogram or MRI. Primary syrinx
formation may be associated with a developmental defect like
hydrocephalus. A syrinx may also form secondary to atlantoaxial
subluxation or other injury, vascular disorder, infection, or
neoplasia. Sometimes the inciting cause is unclear.
Treatment of acute quadriplegia may begin with methylpred.
nisolone sodium succinate IV 15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 24
hours and famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) IV 0.5-1 mg/kg
every 12-24 hours or cimetidine (Tagamet, SmithKline
Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 24 hours. After 24
hours, prednisone 0.25-1 mg/kg PO every 12 hours with doses
230
tapered over 7 to 14 days may be given along with oral doses of
one of the gastrointestinal protectants. The underlying cause if
found should be addressed accordingly. Nursing care and physical
therapy are performed as outlined in Table 9.2. Affected dogs

cause. Syringomyelia is most commonly associated with chronic
progressive quadriparesis.
Neuromuscular Disorders
Acute Polyradiculoneuritis
VAcute polyradiculoneuritis causes acute, flaccid quadriparesis or
quadriplegia. In dogs, the condition was originally called
"coonhound paralysis," as it was first described in coonhounds 7 to
10 days after exposure to an antigen in raccoon saliva. The inciting
cause is often unknown, although recent vaccination or illness can
be documented in some cases. Some evidence has suggested the
involvement of clostridial organisms in the intestine as a source of
antigen. These external antigens are apparently similar to proteins
that make up part of the ventral nerve roots and motor nerves, and
clinical signs are caused by an immune-mediated attack of these
structures with the invasion of inflammatory cells.
V Animals present with acute, progressive, flaccid quadriparesis
that often ascends from the pelvic limbs to the thoracic limbs over
a 12 to 24-hour period. On rare occasions, the thoracic limbs are
more involved than the pelvic limbs. The palpebral reflex may be
depressed or absent in both eves due to involvement of the facial
nerve (CN 7), and dysphagia may be present due to dysfunction of
the vagus nerve (CN 10). If respiratory involvement is severe,
abdominal respiration, hypoventilation, and hypoxia occur.
Hyporeflexia or areflexia with hypotonicity is usually present in all
four limbs. Some tail movement may be preserved. Sensation
remains intact, and some animals have generalized hyperesthesia.
V Diffuse positive waves and fibrillation potentials with normal
or reduced motor nerve conduction velocity are often found on
the EMG, suggesting diffuse polyneuropathy. Motor nerve
conduction velocity may be normal or slowed. The F-wave is
abnormal, suggesting ventral root disease. CSF protein levels can
be normal or elevated, but the leukocyte count is usually normal.
If the animal presents within 24 hours of the onset of
paralysis, intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate
may be given as outlined in Table 9-3.
231
 Affected dogs should be closely monitored, as they may worsen
over a 7-day period before they stabilize and begin to slowly improve.
Paresis then paralysis of intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles can
occur, so respiration should be monitored to detect hypoventilation
and hypoxia. Blood gas determinations should be evaluated if
possible to detect increased pCOz and decreased pOz. Oxygen
therapy or assisted ventilation may be necessary for a few days in
some cases. The nursing care and physical therapy required are
outlined in Table 9.2. Severe generalized muscle atrophy may occur,
making physical therapy essential. The prognosis is usually good with
adequate support, and most dogs recover in 4 to 12 weeks.
Avoidance of known antigenic stimuli, such as vaccinations, should
be considered to prevent recurrence of signs. Recurrence with no
known stimulus has been documented in some dogs and cats.
Tick Paralysis
 Tick paralysis is caused by a neurotoxin secreted by female
ticks of the genus Dermacentor (North America) or Ixodes
(Australia). The toxin causes inhibition of acetylcholine release
at the neuromuscular junction or impairs depolarization of the
distal lower motor neurons and is released as long as the tick is
embedded and feeding. Dogs are most frequently affected. This
disease is rarely seen in cats except in Australia.
V An ascending acute, flaccid quadriparesis develops over a 12 to
24-hour period and is clinically identical to acute polyradiculoneu
ritis. Severely depressed or absent spinal reflexes in all four limbs
with preserved sensation is typically found on the neurologic
examination. Some tail movement may be preserved. Respiratory
distress from paresis of intercostal muscles and the diaphragm can
be seen in advanced cases. Reduced or absent palpebral reflexes due
to facial nerve (CN 7) dysfunction may be present, but involve-
ment of other cranial nerves is rare in North America. Laryngeal
and pharyngeal paresis may occur in cases in Australia.
√ The EMG can be used to differentiate tick paralysis and acute
polyradiculoneuritis. In tick paralysis, no fibrillation potentials or
positive sharp waves are seen to indicate denervation, and there is
little or no response to nerve stimulation. The EMG abnormalities
of dogs with tick paralysis, coral snake envenomation, and botulism
are similar as they all affect neuromuscular transmission.
 Any dog or cat with acute flaccid quadriplegia should be
carefully examined for an engorged tick, including in and around
the ears and between the toes. Care should be taken to remove
232
the whole tick if found. Removal of ticks with topical pesticides
should be done with caution, as organophosphates may further
compromise neuromuscular function. Cases in Australia have
been documented to become progressively worse even after tick
removal, but this has not been documented in North America.
Respiration should be monitored, as a few cases may require
oxygen therapy or ventilatory assistance. Supportive nursing care
as outlined in Table 9-2 is given, but in North America, once
the tick is removed full recovery occurs within 24 to 72 hours.
Snake Envenomation
 The Elapidae family of snakes includes cobras, mambas, and
eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius fulvius) in the southeastern
states and the Texas coral snake (M. f. tenere) in Texas,
Louisiana, and Arkansas. The toxin in the venom is thought to
cause a postsynaptic, nondepolarizing blockade of the neuromus-
cular junction, similar to curare
V There may be a history of playing with a snake, or a dead snake
may be found in the yard where the animal has been. The bite
wounds are usually not obvious, as there is typically minimal tissue
reaction. However, a small, red mark may sometimes be found with
careful examination of the face, muzzle, or pinnae. Clinical signs
are usually evident within several hours of the bite.
V Dogs and cats present with acute, progressive, flaccid quadri-
paresis and may appear mildly sedated. Limb spinal reflexes are
absent, and reduced nociception often occurs. Some tail
movement may be preserved. Reduced palpebral reflexes, reduced
facial sensation, and dysphagia are often seen. A characteristic
feature of coral and tiger snake envenomation is hemolysis and
hemoglobinuria. Ventricular tachycardia may also occur.
V Changes on the EMG are similar to those of tick paralysis.
Coral snake antivenin is available and may help to reduce the
severity of clinical signs if given promptly. The dose of antivenin
is controversial and is usually given empirically (one to four vials
slowly IV). Antivenin is expensive and may cause anaphylaxis.
Thus, a skin test of 1:10 dilution, O.2 ml intradermally may be
considered before IV administration. Not all animals need
antivenin to survive.
 Therapy mainly involves providing supportive care as
described in Table 9.2 and allowing time for the toxin to exit the
body. Animals that have progressive respiratory muscle paresis
233
may require assisted ventilation. A CBC and urinalysis should be
monitored for hemolysis. Fluid therapy at 2 to 3 times mainte-
nance levels should be administered if hemolysis occurs to
protect the kidneys. Blood gases should be monitored for hypoxia
and increased pCOz or decreased pOz should be corrected. The
overall prognosis depends on the size of the snake and amount of
venom received. With supportive care, the prognosis for
recovery from paralysis is often excellent and many animals
make a complete recovery in 7 to 10 days.
Myasthenia Gravis
V Generalized myasthenia gravis may cause acute quadriparesis
in dogs and cats. The quadriparesis may worsen with exercise.
The diagnosis and treatment of myasthenia gravis are discussed
in Section 11.
Botulism
V Ingestion of toxin from the organism Clostridium botulinum is a rare
cause of flaccid quadriparesis or quadriplegia in dogs. Cases docu-
mented in dogs have been associated with type C toxin. Naturally
occurring botulism has not been documented in cats. The most
common source of infection is probably through ingestion of carrion,
although clostridial infections may play a role. The toxin interferes
with the release of acetylcholine from the endplates of motor neurons,
resulting in failure of neuromuscular transmission.
V Acute, progressive quadriparesis develops over a 12-24 hour
period and varies in severity, depending on the amount of toxin
ingested. All spinal reflexes of the limbs are depressed or absent,
and muscle tone is reduced. Facial paralysis, dysphonia,
dysphagia, and megaesophagus from cranial nerve involvement
are often seen. Constipation and urine retention have also been
documented. As the toxin only affects the motor endplates,
sensation remains intact.
V The EMG changes are similar to those of tick paralysis and coral
snake envenomation. The toxin can be identified in the serum,
feces, vomitus, or carrion by a mouse neutralization test, although
this must be done early in the disease process to be useful.
Although a Type C antitoxin is available, to be effective it must be
administered before entry of the toxin into the nerve endings, and
most cases already have neurologic signs on presentation.
V Paresis then paralysis of intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles
can occur, so respiration should be monitored to detect hypoven-
234
tilation and hypoxia. Blood gas determinations should be
evaluated if possible to detect increased pCOz and decreased pOz
Oxygen therapy or assisted ventilation may be necessary for a few
days in some cases. The required nursing care and physical
therapy are outlined in Table 9-2. Stool softeners, suction of the
oropharynx, and administration of artificial tears for corneal
protection may be needed. Antibiotic therapy is usually not
indicated unless concurrent infection is present, because
ingestion of the preformed toxin, rather than infection with the
organism, causes the neurologic impairment in dogs. Many
affected dogs recover fully within 2 to 3 weeks.
 Aminoglycoside and ampicillin administration should be
avoided, as these antibiotics can worsen neuromuscular weakness.
Acute Polyneuropathies
V Other acute polyneuropathies can cause acute quadriparesis or
quadriplegia but are probably rare compared with acute
polyradiculoneuritis. These diseases have many underlying causes
and usually present with a chronic, progressive, or waxing and
waning course and are discussed in Section 10.
Aminoglycoside Intoxication
V Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, amikacin,
kanamycin, and others) can cause or exacerbate blockade of the
neuromuscular junction. This leads to acute, flaccid quadri-
paresis. In animals with neuromuscular disease, these antibiotics
can worsen the paresis. Discontinuation of the drug results in
reversal of the paresis in most cases.

Definitions
Chronic quadriparesis: Quadriparesis that progresses over 1 week
to several months.
Quadriparesis (tetraparesis): Weakness (paresis) in all four limbs,
which can be mild (ambulatory), moderate (nonambulatory, sternal
recumbency), or severe (nonambulatory, lateral recumbency), but
some voluntary limb movement is retained (Figure 1O-1); most
ambulatory animals with quadriparesis also show ataxia and
conscious proprioceptive deficits.
Figure 10-1 Progressive
quadriparesis with
depressed spinal reflexes
of the limbs over several
weeks or months is
often associated with
polyneu ropathy.
Quadriplegia (tetraplegia): Loss of voluntary movements in all
four limbs.
Flaccid or lower motor neuron paresis or paralysis: Paresis
 or paralysis with reduced or absent spinal reflexes in one or
more limbs.
Spastic or upper motor neuron paresis or paralysis: Paresis
 or paralysis with normal or increased spinal reflexes in one or
more limbs.
“Root signature": A sign that a lesion is irritating the nerve
roots to a limb; manifests as reluctance to bear weight on the
limb when standing and lameness or pain of the limb.
Fenestration: A surgical procedure to remove the nucleus
pulposus of the intervertebral disk to prevent future extrusions.
Neuromuscular system: The peripheral nerves, neuromuscular
junctions, and muscles.
Polyradiculoneuritis: Inflammation of many nerve roots and
peripheral nerves.
238
Decubital ulcer: A deep wound with sloughing skin and muscle;
occurs over bony prominences due to constant pressure from
lying in one position too long; the bone is often exposed.
Meningomyelitis: Inflammation of the meninges and spinal cord.
Myelitis: Inflammation of the spinal cord.
Lesion Localization
V The location of lesions that cause chronic quadriparesis are
shown in Figure 10-2. These lesions usually occur in the:
· Focal cervical and cranial thoracic spinal cord (C1-T2)
● Multifocal cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord (C1- L7)
● Diffuse neuromuscular system (peripheral nerves, neuromuscular
juctions or muscles)
Focal cervical spinal cord
(or multifocal spinal cord)
Diffuse peripheral
nerves or muscles
Figure 10-2 Chronic progressive quadriparesis can be associated with a focal
cervical lesion, a multifocal spinal cord lesion, or a generalized neuromuscular
lesion (dots indicate lesion localization).
239
Differentiation of
Spinal Cord and
Neuromuscular Lesions
V An algorithm on how to differentiate spinal cord from neuro-
muscular lesions is shown in Section 9, Figure 9-3.
C1-C5 Spinal Cord Lesions
V If crossed extensor reflexes are present in the thoracic limbs
and the pelvic limb spinal reflexes are normal or hyperactive,
then the lesion is localized to C1-C5.
V If the spinal reflexes of all four limbs are normal or if tho.
racic limb spinal reflexes are normal and pelvic limb spinal
reflexes are hyperactive, the lesion could be at either C1-C5 or
C6-T2.
V May have unilateral Horner's syndrome on the side of
the lesion.
C6-T2 Spinal Cord Lesions
V If the lesion affects most of the C6-T2 region, the flexor
reflexes of the thoracic limbs are reduced or absent, and the
spinal reflexes in the pelvic limbs are normal or exaggerated.
V If the lesion affects only part of the C6-T2 region, the flexor
reflexes of the thoracic limbs may still be normal, and this
lesion cannot be distinguished from a C1-C5 lesion.
V May have unilateral Horner's syndrome on the side of
the lesion.
V May be loss of cutaneous trunci response on the side of
the lesion.
Neuromuscular Lesions
V Decreased or absent thoracic and pelvic limb spinal reflexes.
V Decreased or absent muscle tone in all four limbs.
V Loss of the cutaneous trunci response.

Physical and Neurologic
Examinations
V Examine the ocular fundus for chorioretinitis.
V Examine for evidence of other systemic disease or neoplasia
V Differentiate spinal cord from neuromuscular lesions.
V Check if Horner's syndrome is present (suggests a C1-T2
spinal cord disorder).
V Determine if one or more cranial nerves are affected
(indicates neuromuscular disorders).
V Determine if pain is a feature of the disease process.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis are performed to detect systemic illness and as part of
the preanesthetic evaluation.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultra-
sonography are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or
abnormalities are found on the physical examination.
V Serum creatine kinase (CK) and serum acetylcholine receptor
antibody levels are evaluated if polymyopathy or myasthenia
gravis is suspected.
V The following are tests that are performed under general anes-
thesia, as well as their potential findings:
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show leukocytosis
with or without elevated protein in cases of meningomyelitis
and some neoplastic processes or, in chronic intervertebral disk
disease, myelitis, neoplasia, cysts, and spinal cord compression
elevated protein only.
· Routine vertebral column radiographs may show calcified
cervical intervertebral disks, diskospondylitis, spondylosis defor
mans, and vertebral neoplasia.
· A myelogram with dynamic views is useful to evaluate the
instability and ligamentous hypertrophy associated with caudal
cervical spondylomyelopathy.
· A myelogram may also demonstrate spinal cord compression
in animals with intervertebral disk disease, cysts or neoplasia;
242
primary spinal cord neoplasia may cause the spinal cord to
appear swollen on the myelogram.
· Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) can be useful to evaluate intervertebral disk
disease, diskospondylitis, spinal cord neoplasia and cysts,
and syringomyelia
· Electromyography (EMG), including needle EMG, motor
nerve-conduction velocity, repetitive nerve stimulation, and
F-waves, are evaluated to determine if a diffuse neuromuscular
disease is present and if the lesion is affecting the nerve roots,
peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, and/or muscle.
· Muscle and nerve biopsies may be performed if peripheral
nerve or muscle disease is suspected
V Serum and CSF immunoassays for infectious diseases are indicated
if CSF analysis shows evidence of inflammation.
Spinal Cord Disorders
Degenerative Intervertebral
Disk Disease
V Hansen Type II intervertebral disk disease (IVDD) is associated
with fibroid degeneration and slow protrusion of the anulus fibrosus
into the vertebral canal, causing chronic progressive quadriparesis
(Section 7, Figure 7-5). Type II IVDD is more common in older,
nonchondrodystrophic dogs of any size or breed but can also be seen
in chondrodystrophic breeds, such as dachshunds and Pekingese. On
occasion, Hansen Type I IVDD (Section 7, Figure 7-4) can cause slow
extrusion of the nucleus pulposus, producing quadriparesis that
progresses over several weeks. Cervical disk disease is rare in cats.
Mildly affected dogs may have a stiff, short-strided gait and may have
neck pain. Quadriparesis may be mild or progress to a nonambulatory
condition. Limb spinal reflexes are usually normal or hyperactive.
V Since Type II IVDD rarely causes disk calcification or a narrowed
disk space, routine radiographs are usually normal. CSF analysis
should be performed before myelography to rule out meningomyelitis;
such analysis often shows elevated protein levels. Spinal cord
compression is usually obvious on the myelogram with or without CT
(Figure 1O-3). CT and MRI can be noninvasive ways to evaluate disk
degeneration and spinal cord compression (Section 7, Figures 7-8, 7-
9, and 7-10).
243
Figure 10-3 A lateral myelogram
of a 7-year-old Doberman pinscher
with chronic progressive quadri-
paresis from Type Il intervertebral
disk protrusion at two sites, C5-6
and C6-7 (arrows).
V Many dogs may respond temporarily to medical management
(Section 9, Table 9-1). Acupuncture treatments may also help
relieve the pain and quadriparesis. Lifestyle changes should be
recommended as outlined in Section 7, Table 7-4. Surgery is often
required for dogs that worsen when medication is discontinued
or those that are nonambulatory. Chronic compression can lead to
spinal cord atrophy from disruption of the normal blood flow,
which can reduce the effectiveness of surgery. A ventral slot
surgical technique is most commonly performed (Section 7, Figure
7-11). The prognosis for return to normal function with surgery is
weeks of intensive nursing care (see Section 9, Table 9.2).
V As discussed in Section 9, pneumonia can be a fatal complica
tion, so dogs are turned and respiration and body temperature are
monitored. Turning reduces the chances of decubital ulcers. The
dog must be kept on a clean, padded surface. Dermatitis can occur
secondary to irritation from urine and contamination from feces, so
cleanliness is essential. The bladder should be expressed so
excessive distention does not damage the bladder wall. Most dogs
will defecate reflexively, but an enema or stool softener may be
needed if they become constipated.
V Prophylactic fenestration of other cervical disks at the time of
 surgery is usually performed in small breed dogs and may help to
prevent further recurrence of the disease at another site.
Caudal Cervical
Spondylomyelopathy
V Caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy (CCSM) is seen most
commonly in Great Danes and Doberman pinschers but can occur in
any large-breed dog. Because ataxia of all four limbs is often the initial
244
sign, CCSM has been referred to as wobbler's syndrome. On close
examination, quadriparesis or paraparesis with conscious propriocep-
tive deficits is usually also present. Spinal cord decompression and
stabilization are usually undertaken when affected dogs are ataxic,
before quadriparesis becomes severe. Diagnosis and therapy of CCSM
are presented in Section 8.
Meningomyelitis
V The same inflammatory diseases of the brain discussed in Section 2
can affect the spinal cord. Meningomyelitis or myelitis can cause
chronic quadriparesis with or without cervical pain. The diagnosis is
suspected by finding leukocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein levels
   o       
a higher leukocyte count and protein content than that of the cere-
bellomedullary cistern due to the caudal flow of CSF. An
inflammatory focus may be visible on MRI. Serum and CSF
immunoassays for specific organisms may be performed. Diagnosis and
treatment of infections and other inflammatory disorders are discussed
Diskospondylitis
V Diskospondylitis can cause spinal cord compression due to inflam-
mation and swelling of the intervertebral disk and surrounding
tissues. This pathologic process causes progressive quadriparesis, but
most dogs are evaluated for severe neck pain. Diagnosis and
treatment of diskospondylitis are discussed in Section 7.
Neoplasia
√ Osteochondromatosis, also known as multiple cartilaginous
exostoses, is proliferation of benign masses of cartilage and bone
at metaphyseal growth plates, which often occurs at multiple
sites in young animals. Cervical vertebral osteochondromas can
compress the spinal cord and cause chronic progressive quadri-
paresis and neck pain. Ostechondromas can also produce chronic
paraparesis and are discussed in Section 13.
V Primary or metastatic neoplasia of the vertebrae can produce
chronic progressive quadriparesis from spinal cord compression.
Osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma,
nomas are the most common types of vertebral neoplasia. Bony
proliferation or lysis is usually visible on routine radiographs of the
vertebral column and can be further visualized with CT (see Section
245
7, Figures 7-18 and 7-19). Pain is a primary feature of vertebral
neoplasia. Spinal cord compression or expansion secondary to
neoplasia can be seen on a myelogram with or without CT (Figure
10-4). Neoplasia may be extradural (in the epidural space),
intradural-extramedullary (between the spinal cord and dura)
(Figure 1O-5), or intramedullary (within the spinal cord).
V Most spinal cord tumors are best evaluated with MRI. An
elevated protein level without leukocytic pleocytosis is most
frequently seen on CSF analysis. Occasionally, mild pleocytosis
occurs. Atypical lymphocytes may also occasionally be found in
the CSF in animals with spinal lymphoma, but other tumor cells
are rare. In some cases, fluoroscopy-guided needle aspiration of
the spinal mass may enable collection of tissue for cytologic
examination and identification of the neoplasm. The most
common types of spinal cord tumors are listed in Table 1O-1.

 Meningiomas and peripheral nerve sheath neoplasms are the

 uds nu d una s a a s
tumors. Neoplasia, which metastasizes to the spinal canal or
spinal cord, includes hemangiosarcoma, adenocarconomas from
mammary and prostate glands and lymphoma. Lymphoma is the
most common spinal tumor of cats. Progressive painful para-
paresis is the most common clinical sign in cats, as there is a
predilection for the lymphoma to be localized in the thoracic
and lumbar vertebral canal (see Section 13).
 The appropriate therapy for spinal neoplasia depends on tumor
location, size, and histologic type. The immediate goal of therapy is
to relieve the deleterious effects of spinal cord compression,
which is achieved with corticosteroids and possibly decompressive
surgery. Pain is controlled as described in Section 7, Table 7-2.
Prednisone 0.25-1 mg/kg PO every 12 hours may improve quadri-
paresis, but the disorder returns when prednisone is reduced or
discontinued. If an extradural or intradural-extramedullary neoplasm
is suspected, exploratory dorsal laminectomy or hemilaminectomy is
performed to remove as much of the tumor as possible and to collect
tissue samples for histologic identification of the tumor type.
247
/ Postoperative radiation therapy may reduce or delay re-growth
of neoplastic tissue in some dogs and cats with meningiomas. In
some cases of lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and other
neoplasms, chemotherapeutic and radiation protocols are
available. Dogs and cats with spinal neoplasia generally have a
poor long-term prognosis, but in some cases clinical signs can be
alleviated for a year or more.
Lysosomal Storage Disorders
V Lysosomal storage disorders result from congenital absence or
inactivity of a specific lysosomal enzyme. The substrate normally
metabolized by that enzyme accumulates within cells causing cell
dysfunction and death. Clinical signs vary depending on the type of
enzyme deficiency. The types of lysosomal storage disorders that
cause progressive quadriparesis are listed in Section 2, Table 2-15.
Spinal Cord Cysts
and Syringomyelia
V Depending on their location, epidermoid dermoid and
arachnoid cysts may compress the spinal cord and cause progres-
sive quadriparesis or paraparesis in dogs and cats. Diagnosis and
treatment of spinal cord cysts are discussed in Section 13.
V Syringomyelia can cause progressive quadripanesis and is
discussed in Section 9.
Leukoencephalomvelopathy
V Progressive ataxia and quadriparesis, associated with areas of
demyelination in the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum, are
seen in adult Rottweilers. This condition is known as leukoen-
cephalomyelopathy. CSF analysis, EMG, radiographs, and
myelography are normal. MRI may show lesions within the spinal
cord white matter. There is no treatment. Quadriparesis progresses
over 6 to 12 months until the dog is recumbent. The diagnosis is
usually confirmed on necropsy. An inherited cause is suspected.
Neuromuscular Disorders
Hypothyroid Neuromyopathy
 Hypothyroid neuromyopathy can cause progressive quadri
paresis, muscle atrophy, and depressed spinal reflexes in dogs.
248
Systemic signs of hypothyroidism, such as obesity and alopecia, may
not be evident. Other neurologic signs include head tilt, facial
paralysis, laryngeal paresis, and megaesophagus (Section 6).
Microcytic anemia and elevated cholesterol may be found on the
CBC and chemistry profile, respectively. Fibrillation potentials and
positive sharp waves in limb and paravertebral muscles, slow nerve-
conduction velocities, and decreased amplitudes of evoked muscle
action potentials support the presence of polyneuropathy on EMG.
Ihe diagnosis is best confirmed by demonstration of a decreased
serum total thyroxine (T4) or free T4 in conjunction with an
elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Neurogenic
atrophy is seen on histologic examination of muscle, and demyeli-
nation and axonal degeneration are seen on nerve biopsies.
Levothyroxine sodium (Soloxine, Daniels Pharmaceuticals) O.02
mg/kg PO every 12 hours is administered, and after 4 weeks the
serum T4 level is rechecked, and the dosage is adjusted until results
are within the high normal range. Neurologic signs usually respond
to treatment within 3 months.
Chronic ldiopathic
Polyneuropathy
V Chronic idiopathic polyneuropathy primarily affects adult dogs and
rarely cats. Clinical signs of flaccid paraparesis that progress to flaccid
quadriparesis may develop over several months to years and can be
characterized by periodic remissions and recurrences. Cranial nerve
deficits are occasionally seen (Section 6). Sensory nerve involvement
can result in ataxia (Section 8), reduced or absent conscious proprio.
ception, and a reduced response to noxious stimuli. Abnormalities on
the EMG——diffuse fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves,
complex repetitive discharges, slowed motor nerve conduction veloci.
ties, and F-wave disturbances——support the diagnosis of
polyneuropathy. Denervation atrophy of the muscle and inflamma-
tion, segmental demyelination, or axonal loss of nerves can be seen
on histologic examination of biopsy specimens.
Y Some animals may benefit from prednisone 0.25-1 mg/kg PO
every 12 hours. If improvement occurs, then alternate-day pred-
nisone O.25-1 mg/kg PO may be useful as a long-term therapy to
prevent relapses. If there is no response to prednisone alone,
another immunosuppressant drug may be added, such as cyclophos-
phamide or azathioprine. The prednisone dose is reduced to O.5
mg/kg PO every 12 hours, and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Bristol
Myers Squibb) 1-2 mg/kg PO is administered once daily for 4 days,
discontinued for 3 days, and then given again for 4 days in a repeating
249
cycle then discontinued when remission is achieved or after 4 months
of therapy, or if hemorrhagic cystitis occurs. Although it may take
longer to become effective, azathioprine (Imuran, Glaxo Wellcome) 2
mg/kg/day PO, given until improvement is seen and then reduced to
every other day indefinitely, is another alternative for dogs.
Hemograms and platelet numbers should be closely monitored.
Hepatoxicity can occur with azathioprine, so serum chemistry profiles
and bile acids should be monitored. In some cases, there is no
response to any therapy and the prognosis is grave.
Protozoal
Polyradiculoneuritis/Polymyositis
/ Protozoal polyradiculoneuritis due to either Neospora caninum or
Toxoplasma gondi may occur in dogs and cats, particularly young or
immunosuppressed animals. Puppies usually have accompanying
myositis and are presented with progressive paraparesis and pelvic
limb extension (Section 13). The infection may also cause menin-
goencephalomyelitis (Section 2). The EMG abnormalities of diffuse
fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, complex repetitive
discharges, slowed motor nerve-conduction velocities, and F-wave
disturbances support the diagnosis of polyneuropathy. CSF abnormali-
ties include mixed-cell leukocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein,
but the CSF can also be normal. Serum and CSF immunoassays for
N. caninum or T. gondi may support the diagnosis if high IgM or
rising IgG levels are noted. Diagnosis is confirmed by observing
organisms on histologic examination of a muscle biopsy.
Y Toxoplasmosis and neosporosis can be treated for 2 to 4
weeks with oral trimethoprim-sulfadiazine 15 to 30 mg/kg
every 12 hours or ormetoprim-sulfadimethoxine (Primor,
Pfizer) 15 mg/kg every 12 hours. Clindamycin (Antirobe,
Pfizer) 5-10 mg/kg every 12 hours in dogs and cats may be
added. Pyrimethamine (Daraprim, Glaxo Wellcome) 0.5-1.0
mg/kg once daily for 3 days then reduced to 0.25 mg/kg once
daily for 14 days in dogs and cats may also be used. Bone
marrow suppression has been reported with the use of
pyrimethamine in small animals necessitating CBC monitoring.
The prognosis is guarded, especially if there is severe accompa-
nying muscle damage or contractures.
Polymyopathies
 Chronic progressive quadriparesis may be associated with
chronic polymyositis or other polymyopathies. The spinal
250
reflexes are often preserved, and polymyopathies may be difficult
to differentiate from spinal cord diseases on the neurologic exam
ination. Distinguishing features may be conscious proprioceptive
deficits with some spinal cord lesions, and generalized muscle
pain or atrophy with some polymyopathies. If the spinal reflexes
polyneuropathy. Some endocrine disorders, such as hypothy
roidism, can cause polymyopathy concurrent with
polyneuropathy. Serum CK levels may be elevated or normal.
Fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and complex repeti-
tive discharges (bizarre high-frequency discharges) on the EMG
indicate neuromuscular disease. Histologic examination of a
muscle biopsy specimen confirms polymyopathy and may give
insight into the cause. The differential diagnosis, diagnosis, and
treatment of polymyopathies are discussed in Section 11.
Myasthenia
 Gravis
V Dogs and cats with myasthenia gravis can present with
chronic progressive quadriparesis, but episodic or exercise-
induced paraparesis and quadriparesis are more common. Spinal
reflexes and conscious proprioception are usually normal.
Myasthenia gravis is discussed in Section 11.
Diabetic Polyneuropathy
V Clinical and subclinical polyneuropathy occurs in dogs and
especially in cats with diabetes mellitus. The causes and mecha
nisms of peripheral nerve degeneration remain controversial and
axonal degeneration and regeneration and demyelination and
remyelination. Progressive paraparesis and quadriparesis with
proprioceptive deficits, muscle atrophy, and depressed spinal
reflexes may be seen. Cats often assume a plantigrade posture in
the pelvic limbs. Animals may have hyperesthesia. Diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus is based on the finding of persistent hyper-
glycemia with glycosuria. EMG abnormalities consisting of
diffuse fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, complex
repetitive discharges, slowed motor nerve conduction velocities,
or abnormal F-waves support the diagnosis of polyneuropathy.
Y Partial or full recovery can occur within 6 to 12 months
through adequate control of diabetes with insulin therapy. Some
cats may remain hyperesthetic and resist being handled. Antioxidant
therapy with oral vitamin E 10 to 25 IU/kg once daily and vitamin
C 15 mg/kg may protect the peripheral nerves from further damage
251
and slow disease progression. N-acetylcysteine 25 mg/kg PO every
8 hours daily for 2 weeks then reduced to every other day is
another effective antioxidant therapy. Vitamin C may cause diarrhea,
so a lower dose may be used initially and slowly increased. High doses
of vitamin E may affect blood coagulation and should be used
cautiously in animals with coagulopathies.
Insulinoma Polyneuropathy
V A common cause of hypoglycemia in middle-aged and older
dogs is insulinoma (Section 2). German shepherds, Irish setters,
and boxers seem to be predisposed to this type of tumor.
Hypoglycemia or a paraneoplastic process secondary to insuli-
noma may be responsible for polyneuropathy, but the
pathophysiologic process is not well understood. Clinical signs
include paraparesis that progresses to quadriparesis with
depressed or absent spinal reflexes. EMG may show fibrillation
potentials and positive sharp waves in all muscles, slow nerve-
conduction velocities, and decreased amplitudes of evoked
muscle action potentials; these findings support the presence of
polyneuropathy. Neurogenic atrophy is seen on histologic exami-
nation of muscle biopsies. Loss of axons and myelin may be
found on histologic examination of nerve biopsies. Diagnosis and
treatment of insulinomas are discussed in Section 2. Neuropathy
often improves once the primary tumor is removed.
Paraneoplastic Polyneuropathy
V Neoplasms other than insulinomas can cause a variety of systemic
abnormalities remote from the site of tumor invasion. Collectively,
these are called paraneoplastic disorders. Dogs presenting with a
chronic progressive polyneuropathy should be evaluated for a
neoplastic process. As with insulinomas, if the underlying tumor is
successfully treated, polyneuropathy may resolve.
Toxic Polyneuropathy
/ Whenever polyneuropathy of unknown cause is found, toxic
polyneuropathy should be considered. Many types of neuromuscular
intoxication cause acute weakness, which worsens with exercise.
These are discussed in Section 11. Chemicals documented to
produce chronic polyneuropathies in animals are presented in Table
10-2, but ingestion of these chemicals is rare in dogs and cats.
Degeneration of intramuscular nerve endings is found on histologic
examination of a muscle biopsy. These neuropathies are known as
252
distal axonopathies, or dying-back neuropathies, and are associated
with abnormal axonal transport. Organophosphate and carbamate
intoxication may produce neuromuscular weakness and tremors in
dogs and cats without signs of salivation, diarrhea, or miosis. These
intoxications are discussed in Sections 4 and 11. Dogs appear to be
relatively resistant to delayed organophosphate intoxication.
(Oncovin, Lilly). The neuropathy usually improves after the drug is
discontinued. As chemotherapeutic treatment of various tumors
becomes more commonplace, toxic polyneuropathies are likely to
be recognized more frequently. When in doubt about whether a
substance has caused intoxication, contact the ASPCA National
Animal Poison Control Center(888-426-4435) or another poison
control center.

Congenital or Hereditary
Polyneuropathies
V Congenital and hereditary polyneuropathies are progressive,
breed-specific diseases that affect young cats and dogs. Affected
animals may initially appear paraparetic, but quadriparesis with
generalized muscle atrophy eventually becomes apparent. There
is no treatment. Some polyneuropathies progress rapidly, and
affected animals are often euthanized. Others polyneuropathies
slowly progress over years or stabilize so affected animals may
have a reasonable quality of life. Diagnosis is based on the breed,
history, and clinical signs and findings on the EMG and histo-
logic examination of a nerve or muscle biopsy. The breeds
affected and key features of specific congenital or hereditary
polyneuropathies are outlined in Table 10-3.

Definitions
Episodic or exercise-induced weakness: weakness of the pelvic
limbs or all four limbs and neck that occurs periodically and/or
worsens with exercise (Figure 11-1); there is no evidence that
consciousness is impaired during the episode.
Neuromuscular disorder: disease of the peripheral nerves (lower
motor neurons), neuromuscular junctions, or muscles.
Neuromuscular junction: The terminal part of the peripheral
nerve and the acetylcholine receptor (AchR) on the skeletal
muscle cell membrane.
Myotonia: Tonic spasms of muscles with delayed relaxation.
Cataplexy: sudden loss of muscle tone associated with narcolepsy
(see Section 16).

Physical Examination
V Examine the mucous membranes for pallor or cyanosis.
VEvaluate the strength of the pulse.
V Auscultate the heart to detect cardiac murmurs or arrhythmias
and evidence of abnormal lung sounds
V Examine the skin for hair loss or dermatitis, which might be
associated with dermatomyositis, hypothyroidism,
or hyperadrenocorticism.
V Monitor for fever, which may be present with systemic disease
or during an episode in exercise-intolerant Labrador retrievers.
V Examine for other evidence of systemic disease or neoplasia.
V Determine if muscle atrophy, pain, or cramping is present.
261
Neurologic Examination
The neurologic examination can be normal between episodes or
may have one or more of the following signs:
V Paraparesis or quadriparesis, which worsens with exercise.
√ Ventroflexion of the neck or inability to lift the head due to
neck weakness; this is common in cats with neuromuscular
disorders.
V Muscle cramping or pain.
V Sustained muscle contraction; this is seen as a dimple when
the muscle is tapped with the percussion hammer in myotonic
myopathies.
V Moderate to severe muscle atrophy in all limbs.
V Reduced muscle tone in all four limbs.
V Normal-to-decreased spinal reflexes in the thoracic and
pelvic limbs.
V If there is a concurrent neuropathy, conscious proprioceptive
deficits may be present in the pelvic limbs or all four limbs.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis can be useful to detect anemia, hypokalemia, hypo-
glycemia, renal or bladder disease, and other systemic disorders
and as part of the preanesthetic evaluation.
V Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels may be elevated in some
cases of polymyopathy.
√ Serum antinuclear antibody(ANA) may be positive in some
animals with immune-mediated polymyositis.
V Serum acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody levels are
usually elevated in cases of myasthenia gravis.
V Serum cholinesterase levels are usually reduced in animals
with organophosphate intoxication.
/ Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultra-
sonography are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or if
abnormalities are found on the physical examination.
Megaesophagus and aspiration pneumonia may be seen.
V Electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography may be
abnormal in cardiac diseases.
V A tensilon test (IV edrophonium chloride) usually results in a
262
temporary return to normal exercise tolerance in cases of myas-
thenia gravis with exercise intolerance; cases with mild weakness
from other causes can also appear stronger.
V An adrenocorticotropic (ACTH)-stimulation test often shows
reduced serum cortisol in cases of hypoadrenocorticism and
increased serum cortisol in cases of hyperadrenocorticism; a
dexamethasone-suppression test often shows increased cortisol
levels in cases of hyperadrenocorticism; a urine cortisol-creati-
nine ratio is often elevated in hyperadrenocorticism; serum
endogenous ACTH levels can be normal or elevated with
pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism and low or unde-
tectable with adrenal tumors.
Serum total thyroxine (T4) or free T4 may be low, and serum
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may be elevated in cases of
hypothyroidism. Serum T4 and free T4 will be elevated in cases
of hyperthyroidism
serum lactate and pyruvate levels.
V Urine organic acids and amino acids may be helpful in char-
acterizing metabolic myopathies.
V The following is a list of tests for which anesthesia is required
and their potential findings:
· Electromyography (EMG), including needle EMG, motor
nerve-conduction velocity, repetitive nerve stimulation, and F-
wave evaluation is performed to determine if diffuse neuromus-
cular disease is present and if the lesion affects the peripheral
nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscle.
· A muscle biopsy is performed to diagnose and classify
muscle disease.
· A nerve biopsy is obtained if neuropathy is suspected.
Systemic Disorders
Y Cardiopulmonary disorders may result in exercise-induced
weakness and collapse. Careful examination, including ausculta
tion, ECG, echocardiography, and thoracic radiographs may be
indicated to evaluate the heart and lungs. A Holter or cardiac
event monitor may be useful to record the ECG during an
episode of collapse to ensure that cardiac arrhythmia is not the
inciting cause. Animals with collapse from laryngeal paralysis
usually have stridor (Section 6). A routine CBC and serum
263
chemistry profile will detect anemia, renal failure, electrolyte
abnormalities, and hypoglycemia, which may be causing episodic
or exercise-induced weakness. Abdominal radiography and ultra
sonography may be helpful to further characterize these diseases.
An ACTH stimulation test, dexamethasone-suppression test,
urine cortisol-creatinine ratio, and serum endogenous ACTH
should be considered in suspected cases of hypoadrenocorticism
and hyperadrenocorticism.
Neuromuscular Disorders
latrogenic Corticosteroid
Myopathy
 Dogs treated with long-term corticosteroid therapy for a
variety of chronic diseases commonly develop a myopathy char-
acterized by potentially profound weakness and muscle atrophy.
Classic signs of hyperadrenocorticism, such as thinning of the
hair coat and skin and a pendulous abdomen, often accompany
the myopathy. Dogs that have had fewer than 4 weeks of corti-
costeroid administration rarely develop a clinically significant
disorder. Myopathy is more common after administration of the
fluorinated corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone, betametha
sone, and dexamethasone.
V The EMG may be normal, but the diagnosis is usually made
on histologic examination of a muscle biopsy. The treatment of
choice is to reduce or discontinue the corticosteroids.
Improvement usually follows but can take many weeks to
months. Because of the catabolic effect of corticosteroids, opti-
mizing nutritional status is important. Protein supplementation is
recommended. Inactivity worsens myopathy, and exercise may
prevent the development of weakness. Physical therapy, such as
swimming, whirlpool therapy, and massage, may be useful to
prevent and treat muscle weakness and wasting in patients
receiving corticosteroids.
Polymyositis
Y Polymyositis, a generalized inflammatory process of the muscles,
may be inherited or acquired. The acquired form is associated
with immune-mediated, infectious, paraneoplastic, or
idiopathic processes in dogs and cats. An autosomal dominant
264
inherited dermatomyositis in collies and Shetland sheepdogs begins
with facial dermatitis and masticatory muscle atrophy at approxi-
mately 8 to 10 weeks of age. This disorder can progress to signs of
generalized polymyositis. Immune-mediated polymyositis may be
associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarthritis,
lymphocytic thyroiditis, and other known immune-mediated
disorders. Infections with Toxoplasma gondi and Neospora caninum
can occasionally cause polymyositis in dogs and cats. An under
lying neoplastic process elsewhere in the body can also cause
polymyositis. Idiopathic polymyositis could be immune-mediated.
Any age, breed, or sex of dog or cat may develop polymyositis.
V Clinical findings include acute or chronic exercise intolerance
and muscle weakness, which can be continuous or episodic.
Anorexia, dysphagia, weight loss, and pyrexia may also occur.
Some dogs present with recurrent bouts of aspiration pneumonia
secondary to dysphagia and megaesophagus (Figure 11-3). A stiff,
stilted gait and muscle pain and atrophy are often present.

V The CBC may be normal or show leukocytosis. Serum CK is
often elevated. Areas of positive sharp waves, fibrillation poten-
tials, and complex repetitive discharges can be seen on EMG
examination, but the EMG may also be normal. Serum
immunoassays for N. caninum or T. gondii may support an infec-
tious cause.An ANA test may be positive,which supports an
immune-mediated process, but the test is often normal in cases
suspected to have immune-mediated polymyositis. Histologic
evidence of muscle inflammation is found on examination of a
muscle biopsy. Organisms associated with toxoplasmosis or
neosporosis are occasionally found within muscle biopsy samples.
A thorough evaluation for concurrent neoplasia should be
performed, including thoracic and abdominal radiographs and
abdominalultrasonography.
 Any underlying disease process, such as neoplasia or infection,
must be treated. The treatment of toxoplasmosis and neosporosis
is outlined in Section 2, Table 2-11. Animals with suspected
cases of immune-mediated polymyositis usually respond to pred-
nisone 1-2 mg/kg PO every 12 hours, which is given until
remission is achieved. The dosage can then be gradually tapered
over several weeks, and alternate-day prednisone 0.25-1 mg/kg
PO can be given for an additional 1 to 2 months. Oral famoti-
dine (Pepcid AC, Merck) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12 hours,
cimetidine (Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham) 5-1O mg/kg every 8
hours, or misoprostol (Cytotec, Searle) 1-3 μg/kg every 8 hours
may be given to reduce the chance of gastrointestinal upset or
ulcers when the dose of corticosteroid therapy is high. If signs
recur when prednisone is discontinued, therapy is started again
to obtain remission, and then alternate-day prednisone therapy is
given indefinitely. Serum CK should be monitored during and
after therapy on a monthly basis. If the levels are elevated, pred-
nisone is re-instated or the dose is increased.
Warning: Prednisone therapy often causes polyuria/polydipsia, polypha-
gia, and panting. Give extra water but feed the normal amount. Long-term
corticosteriod therapy can cause gastrointestinal ulcers, hepatopathy.
andmyopathy.
V If the animal does not respond to prednisone alone, another
immunosuppressant drug may be added. Options include oral
cyclophosphamide and azathioprine. The prednisone is reduced
to 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, and oral cyclophosphamide
266
(Cytoxan, Bristol Myers Squibb) 1 to 2 mg/kg PO is adminis-
tered once daily for 4 days, discontinued for 3 days, then given
for 4 days in a repeating cycle and discontinued when remission
is achieved, after 4 months of therapy, or if hemorrhagic cystitis
occurs. Although it may take longer to become effective, another
alternative for dogs is azathioprine (Imuran, Glaxo Wellcome) 2
mg/kg/day PO given until improvement is seen and then reduced
to every other day indefinitely. Hemograms and platelet numbers
should be closely monitored. Because hepatoxicity can occur
with azathioprine, serum chemistry profiles and bile acids should
also be monitored. Most animals respond well to therapy, but
chronic immunosuppression may be necessary as recurrence is
common. Megaesophagus with aspiration pneumonia can compli
cate the treatment. If an underlying neoplastic process is detected
and corrected, polymyositis should resolve. Routine vaccination
can cause a relapse of immune-mediated polymyositis.
Myasthenia Gravis
Y Myasthenia gravis commonly presents as episodic or exercise-
induced weakness due to impaired transmission of acetylcholine
(ACh) at the neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscles. Other
clinical presentations of myasthenia gravis include dysphagia,
laryngeal paresis, regurgitation (Section 6), paraparesis, and
quadriparesis. Myasthenia gravis may be congenital or acquired
and associated with an immune-mediated or paraneoplastic
process. Congenital myasthenia gravis occurs in Jack Russell
terriers, smooth fox terriers, Samoyeds, and various breeds of
cats. Acquired myasthenia gravis may occur in some cats 2 to 4
months following initiation of methimazole (Tapazole, Jones
Medical Industries) therapy for hyperthyroidism. Weakness
resolves after the drug is discontinued.
V In immune-mediated myasthenia gravis, antibodies are formed
against the ACh receptor of skeletal muscles, and these anti-
bodies interfere with normal muscle contraction. Affected
animals progressively develop a shortened stride with exercise,
which eventually becomes total fatigue and inability to walk.
Strength returns with brief rest, and they are again able to
ambulate for short distances. The palpebral reflex becomes
fatigued with repeated testing, and sometimes facial nerve paresis
is present. Despite profound weakness, conscious proprioception
and spinal reflexes are usually normal. Megaesophagus and
dysphagia are common in dogs and can result in excessive saliva-
tion, regurgitation, aspiration pneumonia, and death.
267
V Intravenous administration of the short-acting anti-
cholinesterase edrophonium chloride (Tensilon, ICN) 1 to 5 mg
in dogs and O.2 to 1 mg in cats may dramatically improve
strength during an episode of collapse. If higher doses are given,
a cholinergic crisis of bradycardia, profuse salivation, dyspnea,
cyanosis, and limb tremors may result, and this can be reversed
with atropine O.05 mg/kg IV. Improvement with edrophonium
chloride does not necessarily rule myasthenia gravis in or out, as
other causes of weakness, like polymyositis, commonly improve
with edrophonium chloride. A definitive diagnosis can be made
with serologic testing documenting elevated AchR antibodies.
As some cases may be falsely seronegative, re-testing is important
in all weak animals suspected to have myasthenia gravis. The
severity of clinical signs may not correspond with the degree of
elevation of ACh receptor antibody titers.
V Megaesophagus and aspiration pneumonia may be seen on
thoracic radiographs (Figure 11-3). In paraneoplastic myasthenia
gravis, thymoma may be seen as a cranial mediastinal mass on
thoracic radiographs. A thorough physical and radiographic
workup, including abdominal ultrasonography should be
performed to search for neoplasia. Some dogs with myasthenia
gravis have concurrent hypothyroidism, and weakness does not
improve until both disorders are treated. In hypothyroidism,
      t     
levels are usually elevated. Myasthenia gravis and polymyositis
may also occur together, and serum CK levels may be elevated
EMG is often normal except for a decremental evoked muscle
response on repetitive nerve stimulation of 5/second.
(Mestinon, ICN) 0.5-3 mg/kg PO every 8 to 12 hours with
food. A liquid formulation of pyridostigmine bromide is recom-
mended so that the dose can be easily adjusted to the level
needed to control clinical signs. With high doses, weakness may
occur as a result of a cholinergic crisis; thus, a low dose of pyri-
dostigmine is initially given then slowly increased until weakness
resolves. Famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) O.5-1 mg/kg every 12
hours PO may reduce the nausea and gastrointestinal irritation
from the pyridostigmine bromide
 Concurrent hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine
sodium (Soloxine, Daniels) 0.02 mg/kg PO every 12 hours.
After 4 weeks of therapy, a serum total T4 is obtained and the
dosage adjusted until the total serum T4 is maintained within
the normal range. Surgical removal of the thymoma or other
268
neoplasm is necessary to achieve remission in cases of paraneo-
plastic myasthenia gravis. Concurrent immune-mediated
polymyositis must also be treated as described above to resolve
the weakness.
ration pneumonia is not present, prednisone O.25-1 mg/kg PO
every 12 hours may be given. In a few cases, weakness may
worsen temporarily when prednisone therapy is intiated.
Prolonged prednisone therapy is avoided because iatrogenic
corticosteroid-induced myopathy may cause further weakness. If
clinical signs improve, alternate-day prednisone therapy at the
lowest effective dose is administered. If there is no response to
prednisone alone, azathioprine (Imuran, Glaxo Smith Kline) 2
mg/kg PO once daily may be given until improvement is seen as
described above for polymyositis. Aspiration pneumonia must be
treated aggressively with antibiotics as it can be life-threatening.
Aminoglycoside antibiotics, ampicillin, and other drugs that
might further reduce neuromuscular transmission are avoided.
V Most dogs have megaesophagus and to avoid regurgitation
should be fed small amounts of moist food made into small balls
two or three times daily from an elevated surface. The dog is
then held vertically (i.e., with the front feet on a chair and the
back feet on the floor) for 10 to 15 minutes after eating to assist
the movement of food into the stomach. Small amounts of water
are offered often, and the dog must drink with the head elevated
When regurgitation is severe, gastrostomy tube feeding may be
necessary to maintain nutrition, ensure the administration of
pyridostigmine therapy, and avoid aspiration pneumonia.
V Serial monitoring of AchR antibody levels on a bimonthly
then monthly basis can help track the disease progress. The
prognosis varies. Most animals respond well to therapy, others
have no response, and still others have recurrent bouts of aspira-
tion pneumonia that necessitate intensive therapy. Animals that
have little response to routine therapy should have serial evalua.
remission can occur within 3 to 12 months in animals with
immune-mediated myasthenia gravis. As clinical signs improve,
pyridostigmine bromide doses are reduced and therapy is discon
tinued when remission occurs. Although megaesophagus can be
permanent, regurgitation improves with remission. Recurrences
can be seen. Routine vaccination may cause a relapse of
immune-mediated myasthenia gravis.
269
Hypokalemic Polymyopathy
weakness, persistent ventral flexion of the neck, and occasionally
muscle pain (Figure 11-1). Conscious proprioception and spinal
reflexes are normal. These signs are rare in dogs. The serum
potassium level is often 1.5-3.5 mEq/L (normal, 4-5 mEq/L).
Serum CK is often 500 to 10,000 U/L (normal, 250 U/L). Chronic
renal failure with a loss of potassium in the urine is a common
cause of hypokalemia in cats, and serum blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated. Animals consuming
diets containing less than O.6% potassium or acidifying high-
protein diets may develop hypokalemic polymyopathy. Other
conditions that may result in hypokalemia include hyperthy-
roidism, diuretic therapy, anorexia, chronic vomiting or diarrhea,
and hepatic disease. A suspected inherited hypokalemia may occur
in Burmese cats from 2 to 6 months of age.
V EMG may be normal or have areas of positive waves and
fibrillation potentials. Histologic examination of muscle biopsies
may be normal or show muscle fiber necrosis with little or no
evidence ofinflammation.
 Potassium gluconate (Tumil K, Daniels) 24 mEq PO every 12
hours may be used in all animals. The dosage is adjusted until serum
potassium levels are normal. In cats with renal dysfunction, oral
supplementation must be continued, but in others a diet with greater
than O.6% potassium is enough. Severely hypokalemic cats may die of
respiratory paralysis and can be cautiously treated with potassium
chloride O.2-O.4 mEq/kg/hour IV diluted in intravenous fluids with
constant cardiac monitoring and evaluation of serum potassium every
4 hours until the potassium level reaches 3.5 mEq/L. Ventilatory
support may be necessary.
V Serum CK and potassium levels may be monitored, and both
should return to normal as the cat clinically improves. Serum
BUN and creatinine levels often return to normal as potassium
levels return to normal in cats with renal disease. Regular moni-
toring of serum potassium levels is important for long-term
management. The prognosis for resolution of weakness is good.
Subacute Organophosphate
Intoxication
 A common cause of persistent ventral flexion of the neck and
exercise-induced weakness in cats and generalized weakness in both
dogs and cats is subacute organophosphate intoxication.
270
Chlorpyrofos is a typical organophosphate that causes subacute
organophosphate intoxication 7 to 10 days after exposure. The
acute signs of miosis, salivation, and tremors are often absent in
these cases. Nonpainful neuromuscular weakness with ventral
flexion of the neck may be the only presenting sign in cats.
Conscious proprioception and spinal reflexes are normal. A history
of toxic exposure and a low serum cholinesterase level support the
diagnosis. Cats with serum cholinesterase levels below 5OO IU
(normal, 900 to 1200 IU) have neurologic signs. Administration of
diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Parke-Davis) 4 mg/kg PO every 8
hours may significantly improve the weakness. Most cats return
to normal in 3 to 6 weeks. Cholinesterase levels may be monitored
and will increase slowly as the clinical signs improve.
Other lntoxications
V Some drugs and chemicals are toxic to the neuromuscular
system and cause acute weakness. The possibility of exposure to
prescription and over-the-counter medications and toxic chemicals
and plants should be discussed with the owner. When in doubt
about whether a substance can cause intoxication, the ASPCA
National Animal Poison Control Center (888-426-4435), or any
other poison control center can be consulted.
Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's
Myopathy
 The prevalence of subclinical myopathy in hyperadrenocorti-
cism (Cushing's disease) in dogs may be high. A distinct
myopathy has not been reported in cats with hyperadrenocorti-
cism, but muscle wasting can be a prominent finding. Clinical
manifestations are similar to those of exogenous corticosteroid
myopathy with muscle atrophy and weakness. Unilateral or
bilateral pelvic limb stiffness from muscle fibrosis may occur
initially, and the thoracic limbs may become involved over time.
Severe pelvic limb rigidity with myotonia can occur in some dogs
with chronic myopathy. Serum CK may be elevated in some
dogs. Trains of positive waves and complex repetitive discharges
may be observed on EMG. Histologic examination of a muscle
biopsy shows muscle fiber necrosis and fibrosis. If clinical signs
are mild, some dogs improve over a period of several months if
the disease is effectively treated. Improvement in motor function
appears to be inversely related to the duration of disease prior to
therapy, and some deficits often persist.
271
Hypoadrenocorticism
V Muscle weakness and exercise intolerance occur frequently in
association with hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's disease) in dogs.
Adrenal insufficiency impairs muscle carbohydrate metabolism,
water and electrolyte balance, muscle blood flow, and adrenergic
sensitivity, all of which are factors that contribute to the myopathy
associated with Addison's disease. Weakness is usually generalized
   sdo o s a   
Serum CK, EMG, and muscle biopsy may be normal. Correction of
the electrolyte imbalance and glucocorticoid deficiency usually
eliminates the clinical weakness.
Hypothyroid Neuromyopathy
V Hypothyroidism can cause muscle weakness due to neuromy-
opathy in dogs. The classic clinical signs of hypothyroidism,
including lethargy, weight gain, seborrhea, and hair loss are not
always obvious. Clinical signs suggestive of neuromuscular dysfunc-
tion in hypothyroid dogs include weakness, stiffness, muscle pain,
reluctance to move, and muscle wasting. If both peripheral nerves
and muscles are affected, then conscious proprioceptive deficits,
depressed spinal reflexes, and cranial nerve deficits may be found.
Microcytic anemia and elevated cholesterol may be found on the
CBC and chemistry profile, respectively. Serum CK levels can be
elevated but may also be normal. The diagnosis is confirmed when
serum total T4 and free T4 levels are reduced and serum TSH
levels are elevated. Muscle biopsy sections show atrophy of the type
II muscle fibers. Levothyroxine sodium (Soloxine, Daniels
Pharmaceuticals) O.02 mg/kg PO every 12 hours is given. After 4
weeks of therapy, serum T4 levels are rechecked and the dosage is
adjusted until T4 levels are maintained within the normal range.
Weakness usually responds to treatment within 3 months.
Hyperthyroid Neuromyopathy
YA few cats with hyperthyroidism may be weak and an even
fewer will have ventral flexion of the neck. Owners will report a
decreased ability to jump and fatigue associated with physical
exertion such that cats may lie down or rest when moving from
one place to another. Serum total T4 levels are usually elevated.
Ireatment of hyperthyroidism in cats may involve administration of
radioactive iodine, oral methimazole (Tapazole, Lilly), or thyroidec-
tomy. There are risks and benefits associated with each type of
therapy, which are beyond the scope of this book. The weakness
272
resolves once a euthyroid state is achieved. Acquired myasthenia
gravis may occur in some cats 2 to 4 months after initiation of
methimazole therapy. The weakness resolves and AchR anti-
bodies return to the normal range after therapy is discontinued.
Exercise-induced Collapse of
Labrador Retrievers
V Young Labrador retrievers between 7 months and 2 years of
age may present with weakness and collapse during exercise.
Weakness begins in the pelvic limbs but can progress to total
collapse followed by a period of confusion. The body temperature
is often severely elevated (up to 41.6° C [107” F]), and severe
alkalosis is present on blood gas analysis immediately following
exercise. Most mildly affected dogs return to normal within 20
minutes. All remaining clinicopathologic and electrodiagnostic
tests and histologic examination of muscle biopsies are normal.
An inherited metabolic myopathy associated with insulin and
glucose uptake in the muscle is suspected. There is no specific
therapy available; however, empiric treatment for metabolic
myopathies can be tried. Such therapy consists of carnitine 50
mg/kg PO every 12 hours, co-enzyme Q 1O0 mg PO once daily
and riboflavin 1o0 once daily PO. Any store carrying nutritional
supplements will have these products.
damage or death. Exercise during high ambient temperatures,
excitement, and continuous intense exercise are avoided.
Hunting dogs may be less affected during cold weather. The
clinical signs do not progress with age and can usually be
managed with lifestyle changes.
Congenital and Inherited
Myopathies
There are many breed-specific generalized muscle disorders in
dogs and cats. In many of these disorders, finding characteristic
muscle changes on histologic examination of muscle biopsies
provides the definitive diagnosis. There are no specific treat-
ments. The clinical course of these disorders varies——some
animals become stable and can maintain a good quality of life,
while others deteriorate with severe muscle atrophy and fibrosis
and death. Table 11-l outlines the diseases, affected breeds, and
a few key features of each disorder.

Lipid Storage Myopathy
V A biochemical defect within the muscle can lead to excessive
storage of lipid. The clinical presentation varies and includes
muscle atrophy, weakness, and in some cases dramatic muscle
pain. Serum CK and EMG may be normal. Excessive lipid depo-
sition is observed on histologic examination of a muscle biopsy
specimen using special staining techniques. Further investiga-
tions, including evaluation of urinary organic acids; plasma
amino acid concentrations; and quantification of total, free, and
esterified carnitine in plasma, urine, and muscle can be
performed to try to determine specific metabolic abnormalities.
Y Treatment with carnitine 50 mg/kg PO every 12 hours, co-
enzyme Q 100 mg PO once daily, and riboflavin 100 mg/day PO
can result in an improvement of clinical signs in 4 to 6 weeks. Any
store that sells nutritional supplements will carry these products.
Mitochondrial Myopathies
Y Inherited enzymatic defects within the mitochondrial
electron-transport chain can lead to polymyopathy. Clumber and
Sussex spaniels, Old English sheepdogs, boxers, and Jack Russell
terriers have been affected. Clinical signs associated with mito-
chondrial myopathies include exercise-induced weakness,
cramping with minimal exercise, chronic progressive quadri-
paresis, and muscle atrophy. Resting and post-exercise plasma
lactate and pyruvate concentrations are elevated. Massive prolif
eration of abnormal mitochondria is seen on histologic
examination of a muscle biopsy specimen with special staining
techniques. The aggregates of abnormal mitochondria stain red
with the Gomori-modified trichrome stain in frozen biopsy
sections, creating the pathologic representation of ragged-red
muscle fibers.
Y Treatment as described above for lipid storage myopathies
may be tried, but mitochondrial myopathies may rapidly progress
and are often fatal.
Nutritional Polymyopathies
V Diets low in vitamin E and selenium can cause a nutritional
polymyopathy referred to as white muscle disease. This condition is
rarely seen now that diets with adequate vitamin E and selenium are
routinely fed. Serum CK is elevated, and necrosis is found on histo
logic examination of a muscle biopsy specimen. If muscle damage is
not severe, correcting the diet improves the myopathy and weakness.
276
Paraneoplastic Polymyopathy
V In confirmed cases of polymyositis of unknown origin, the possi-
bility of an underlying neoplastic disorder should be considered. A
thorough examination for neoplasia should be done whenever
neuromyopathy of unknown origin is diagnosed. The myopathy
Thiamine Deficiency
V Because of routine feeding of well-balanced pet foods,
thiamine (vitamin Bl) deficiency rarely occurs. Thiamine defi-
ciency may initially manifest as ventral neck flexion in cats, but
it rapidly progresses to cause dementia, stupor, or seizures. This
disorder is discussed in Section 2.
Brainstem Disorders
Cataplexy
Cataplexy is sudden loss of muscle tone with excitement or
exercise and is associated with narcolepsy. The weakness may
only involve the pelvic limbs, and the animal may not fall
asleep. A discussion of the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy
and cataplexy is found in Section 16.

Lesion Localization
V The location of lesions that cause acute paraparesis or para-
plegia are shown in Figure 12-2. These lesions are usually found
in the:

Diagnostic Evaluation
Important Historical Questions
· Acute onset over 24 to 72 hours?
· Progressive or nonprogressive?
· Possibility of recent trauma? (If so, obtain vertebral
radiographs before proceeding further.)
· Is the animal in pain?
· Difficulty jumping or going up or down stairs?
● Have there been past episodes of paraparesis?
· Past or present neoplasia?
· Is urinary or fecal incontinence present?
· Can the animal urinate voluntarily?
● Any difficulty breathing, depression, anorexia, or other signs
of systemic illness?
· Any recent or current medication?
● Effectiveness of attempted therapies?
Physical and Neurologic
Examinations
V Auscultate the chest for evidence of cardiopulmonary disease
and other systemic disease
√ Examine hind limb pulses and perfusion
V Localize the lesion to either T3-L3, L4-S2, or
lumbosacral neuromuscular
V Determine the severity of signs—ataxia, paresis, paralysis, loss
of deep pain (Table 12-1)
V Determine if painful and location
V If urinary incontinence is present, determine whether the
bladder is easy or difficult to express
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and urinalysis
are performed to detect systemic illness and as part of the preanes-
thetic evaluation.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultrasonog-
raphy are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or abnormalities are
found on the physical examination.

V Thoracic radiographs show cardiac enlargement with or
without pulmonary edema in cats with cardiomyopathy.
V A Doppler-flow sensing device placed on the dorsomedial
aspect of the metatarsals can be used to evaluate blood flow in
distal pelvic limbs.
V Ultrasonography of the distal aorta and illiac arteries may
often demonstrate a thrombus and obstruction of blood flow.
V Electrocardiogram and echocardiography can be useful to
evaluate cardiomyopathy
V Coagulation tests, such as activated clotting time (ACT),
prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PPT)
may be indicated for animals with thromboembolism and no
evidence of cardiac disease.
V The following tests are done under anesthesia; potential
findings are also noted.
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show leukocytosis with
or without elevated protein levels in animals with acute IVDD,
meningitis, and some neoplastic processes; or elevated protein
alone may be noted in IVDD, trauma, and neoplasia.
● Routine vertebral column radiographs can detect vertebral
fractures and luxations, calcified intervertebral disks, narrowed
intervertebral disk spaces, and vertebral neoplasia.
● Myelography is useful to detect spinal cord compression from
IVDD or neoplasia or spinal cord expansion from neoplasia or
edema secondary to fibrocartilaginous embolism.
285
· Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) can be useful to evaluate IVDD, fibrocarti-
laginous embolism, and an inflammatory focus or neoplasm of
the spinal cord.
· Surgical exploration of the spinal canal can enable removal
or biopsy of masses for histologic examination.
V Serum and CSF immunoassays for infections diseases are
indicated if CSF analysis shows evidence of inflammation.
Neuromuscular Disorders
Aortic Thromboembolism
 Thromboembolism of the aorta or iliac arteries (saddle
thrombus) occurs commonly in cats and rarely in dogs. In cats, it
is often associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A large
thromboembolus can lodge in the caudal aorta or the iliac
arteries and cause pelvic limb pain, symmetric or asymmetric
paraparesis, or paraplegia from ischemia of the peripheral nerves
and muscles. Femoral pulses are often absent, and reduced blood
flow to the pelvic limbs is often found using a Doppler-flow
sensing device placed on the dorsomedial metatarsal region. The
footpads may be cyanotic, and distal limbs usually feel cool. The
pelvic limb muscles, particularly the gastrocnemius muscles, are
often firm and painful. Spinal reflexes and deep pain are usually
absent. Affected cats often have a murmur or gallop rhythm on
auscultation of the heart.
V Cardiac enlargement and pulmonary edema may be seen on
thoracic radiographs. Echocardiography usually shows evidence
of cardiac disease, and thrombi may be visualized in the left
atrium. Ultrasonography of the distal aorta and iliac arteries may
allow visualization of the thrombus. Coagulation tests, such as
ACT, PT, and PPT may be indicated for animals with no
evidence of cardiac disease.
V Therapy involves addressing the underlying disease process and
trying to prevent further nerve and muscle damage. Aspirin,
warfarin, and heparin have been used to reduce the chances of
further thromboembolism, but therapy must be closely monitored
to reduce the possibility of undesirable side effects. Streptokinase
and tissue-type plasminogen activator have been given to try to
reduce the size of the thrombus but have had variable results, and
286
cause hemorrhage and other adverse effects. Pain is controlled as
outlined in Section 7, Table 7-2. Treatment protocols are
complex and change constantly. Consultation with a specialist is
recommended. Some cats can re-canalize the thrombus and
regain some pelvic limb function. The long-term prognosis is
often poor because of the severity of the underlying disease
process and the likelihood of recurrence.
Spinal Cord Disorders
Degenerative Intervertebral
Disk Disease
 Hansen Type I IVDD is the most common cause of acute para-
paresis and paraplegia of dogs. As discussed in Section 7, in Type I
IVDD, the nucleus pulposus ruptures through the anulus fibrosus,
causing contusion and compression of the spinal cord (Section 7,
Figure 7-4). A disk rarely extrudes into the spinal canal between
T2-T10 because of the presence of the conjugal (intercapital)
ligament, which traverses the space between the ribs immediately
dorsal to the disk. Because the size of the lumbar vertebral canal is
small compared with that of the spinal cord, there is little room for
extruded disk material without significant spinal cord compression.
In addition, because the spinal cord is shorter than the vertebral
column in dogs and spinal cord segments L4-Cd5 are located
within the L4-L7 vertebral canal, several spinal cord segments and
nerve roots can be compressed by a single disk (Section 1, Figure 1-
2). The mobility of the thoracolumbar junction results in a high
incidence of IVDD in this region. Jumping off the couch or similar
sharp moves of the vertebral column can cause the disk to extrude
with a force that can render the dog paralyzed for life. As a result,
thoracolumbar disk extrusion causes more extensive spinal cord
injury than cervical disk extrusion (Section 9).
Y Dachshunds, Pekingese, Lhasa apsos, beagles, cocker spaniels,
Shih Tzus, and many other small-breed dogs and some large-
breed dogs are at risk for acute paraparesis and paraplegia from
acute Type I IVDD. The incidence in Dachshunds exceeds that
of other dogs. Acute IVDD is rare in cats unless it is associated
with trauma. Severity of the spinal cord injury can be evaluated
as outlined in Table 12-1. The extruded disk is usually on the
side of the most affected pelvic limb if asymmetric paresis is
present. If paraplegia with or without deep pain is found, there is
287
some hope for return of function, but emergency medical and
surgical therapy are essential to ensure the best possible outcome.
If dogs are presented within 24 hours of the onset of paraplegia,
IV methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) is immediately
administered as outlined in Table 12-2, and referral to a
specialist for emergency surgical decompression is recommended.
Table 12-2
Methylprednisolone therapy for acute paraplegia
Acute paraplegia presented within 8 hours of onset:
 (Refer immediately for emergency surgical decompression if the animal is stable.)
● Two hours after the initial dose, MPss 15 mg/kg IV is given and repeated every
6 hours for 24-48 hours if voluntary movement is still absent
·To prevent gastrointestinal complications.give IV famotidine
(Pepcid AC) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours or cimetidine (Tagamet) 5-10 mg/kg
every8hours.
Acute paraplegia between 8 hours and 24 hours of onset:
· MPSs 15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 24 hours. (Refer for emergency surgical
decompression after the first dose if the animal is stable.)
Warnings
● Do not use MPss at higher doses, in ambulatory animals, or if the patient
presents more than 24 hours after the onset of injury, as the pathologic condition
maybeworsened.
· Stop treatment if melena or vomiting occurs
V If the dog can still move voluntarily, then high-dose MPSS IV is
not necessary. Aside from the immediate spinal cord tissue damage
done by the extruded disk material, secondary neurotoxic processes
result in the formation of oxygen containing free radicals and a cycle
of progressive spinal cord destruction that continues over 24 to 48
hours. The antioxidant and other neuroprotective properties of
MPSS have been shown to reduce spinal cord destruction if a
specific dose range is administered IV within 8 hours of an induced
spinal cord injury in experimental laboratory animals. These doses
and time intervals have been extrapolated for use in dogs.
V Although dogs usually lose the cutaneous trunci response before
the deep pain response, sometimes the opposite occurs, and this may
indicate that spinal cord damage is most significant deep in the white
matter. Many of these dogs can still recover adequate function. A few
dogs with severe spinal cord injury can develop ascending myeloma-
288
lacia and die from respiratory paralysis regardless of therapy. Most of
these dogs have paraplegia, loss of pelvic limb and anal reflexes, loss
of deep pain, and a progressive ascending loss of the cutaneous trunci
response on serial neurologic examinations.
V It is common to see multiple calcified disks on plain radiographs
especially in chondrodystrophic breeds of dogs. A narrowed disk
space and calcified material in the spinal canal may also be present
(Figure 12-4), but the lesions obvious on routine radiography may
not be associated with the current problem. CSF analysis should
always be performed first to rule-out meningomyelitis, although a
mild increase in the number of leukocytes may occur in cases of
acute disk extrusion.
V Diagnostic imaging is used to determine the diagnosis and the site
of spinal cord compression prior to surgery. Deviation of the contrast
columns or diffuse spinal cord swelling with thinning or absence of
contrast media over one or more vertebrae can be observed on a
myelogram (Figure 12-5). CT after the myelogram can further
delineate the extent of a compressive lesion. CT in chondrodys-
trophic breeds and MRI if available are preferred to avoid the
deleterious effects of myelography (see Section 7, Figures 7-8, 7-9, 7-
10, and Section 9, Figures 9-5, and 9-6). CT and MRI are extremely
useful for identifying lateral disk extrusion as well as the extent of any
 associated extradural and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

extrusion is most effective within 24 hours of the onset of signs,
and emergency referral is important. Surgery is recommended for
most dogs with significant paraparesis or paraplegia.
Approximately 90% of paraparetic dogs, 85% of paraplegic dogs
with response to deep pain, and 50% of paraplegic dogs with no
response to deep pain recover with surgery. Some dogs with para-
is reduced the longer surgery is postponed. In addition, recovery
times with surgical intervention are usually much shorter than with
medical therapy alone, and prophylactic fenestration can be
performed to prevent recurrence of thoracolumbar disk extrusion in
the future. Medical management of mildly paraparetic dogs that are
not having surgery is outlined in Table 12-3. The same protocol
can be followed in paraplegic dogs when the expense makes surgery
prohibitive for some owners. Physical therapy and nursing care
should be given as outlined in Table 12-4, but strict rest is essential,
so whirlpool baths, swimming, sling walks, and other exercise are
avoided for 4 weeks.
290
Table 12-3
Medical Management of Paraparetic Dogs Not Having Surgery
● Strict crate confinement for 4 weeks (activity is limited to short leash
walks with a harness for urinating and defecating). No walking around the house
If possible, the animal is gently carried.
·Oral prednisone 0.25-1 mg/kg every 12 hours with tapered
doses over 7-14 days is given to reduce spinal cord swelling from compres-
sion. If the animal improves then relapses as the dose is reduced, increase pred-
nisone dose again and recommend surgery.
● Famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) 0.5-1 mg/kg P0 every 12-24 hours,
cimetidine (Tagamet, Smithkline Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg PO every 12
hours, or misoprostol (Cytotec, Searyl) 1-3 pg/kg PO every 8 hours or
when the prednisone dose is high
● Oral diazepam 0.5-2 mg/kg every 6-8 hours as needed (not to
exceed 10 mg every 6 hours) may help relieve painful muscle spasms.
·If pain is severe,see Section 7. Table 7-2.
Table 12-4
Nursing Care and Physical Therapy for Paraplegic Dogs
●Keep on a clean, padded surface and turn to the opposite side every 6 hours to
avoid decubital ulcers.
●Monitor for fever twice daily for 1 week after surgery.
● Express bladder every 6-8 hours if unable to urinate, and monitor the urine for blood
· Assist in defecation if needed.
● Keep skin dry and free of urine and feces (apply water-repellent ointment to
perineal and caudal abdominal areas).
● Feed a well-balanced diet, and have water readily available
● Ensure strict rest for 4 weeks if surgery is not performed
● Massage and perform passive range-of-motion exercise of the pelvic limbs for
15 minutes 3-4 times a day until able to walk
● Whirlpool baths and swimming can begin 5-7 days after surgery but should not
be done for 4 weeks if surgery is not performed or for 6 weeks if a vertebral frac
ture has been repaired.
●Assist attempts to stand and support weight 3-4 times a day.
· Sling walks can begin when some movement returns but not for 4 weeks if
surgery is not performed or for 6 weeks if a vertebral fracture has been repaired.
291
Warning: Prednisone therapy often causes polyuria/polydipsia, polyphagia,
and panting. Give extra water, and feed normal amounts of a high-quality.
low-calorie diet, as paraplegic dogs have reduced activity. Long-term corticos-
teroid therapy can cause gastrointestinal ulcers, hepatopathy, and myopathy.
 The goal of surgery is to decompress the spinal cord and remove
extruded disk material. The type of surgery performed is usually
determined by the location of the extruded disk. Hemilaminectomy
is performed for T10-L4 extrusions (Figure 12-6); dorsal laminec-
tomy is performed for extrusions caudal to L4 because the ilia
prevent a dorsolateral approach (Figure 12-7).

lamina to expose the spinal cord and

292
V If the animals' response to deep pain is absent, durotomy may be
performed to visualize the spinal cord parenchyma and assess the
prognosis. Liquefaction of the cord indicates myelomalacia, which
carries a poor prognosis. Following decompressive surgery, prophy.
lactic fenestration of the T11-12 to L3-4 disks may be performed in
small chondrodystrophic dogs to prevent future extrusion of other
disks. Only prophylactic fenestration of obviously degenerate disks
is performed in larger dogs because vertebral instability can result
and cause future problems.
Table 7-2. Oral prednisone 0.25 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 days
then tapered over 7 to 14 days may be given after surgery.
Famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) 0.5-1mg/kg PO every 12 to 24
hours, cimetidine (Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg PO
every 12 hours, or misoprostol (Cytotec) 1 to 3 μg/kg PO every 8
hours or another gastrointestinal protectant is given to reduce upset
or ulceration from the prednisone. Oral muscle relaxants, like
diazepam O.5-2 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours as needed (not to exceed
10 mg every 6 hours) may help relieve painful muscle spasms and
also make the bladder easier to express.
 Paraplegic dogs are easier to care for than quadriplegic dogs.
Decubital ulcers, urine contact dermatitis, and bladder infections
are the biggest complications. Postoperative nursing care and
physical therapy are outlined in Table 12-4. The bladder may
have to be expressed for up to 1O days after surgery, but with T3.
L3 lesions, reflex or voluntary urination usually begins shortly
after that time. The bladder may have to be expressed for a
longer period in patients with L6-S2 lesions. As voluntary limb
movement appears, control of urination often returns. If the
response to deep pain testing is absent for more than a month,
paraplegic dogs are unlikely to recover function. Voluntary
movement, which indicates improvement of function, must be
distinguished from spinal walking, which occurs 1 to 2 months
after injury. Deep pain is usually absent in dogs that are spinal
walking. Most dogs have an excellent prognosis and continue to
improve for 6 to 12 months following surgery. Dogs with para-
plegia often enjoy exercise in a wheeled cart placed under their
pelvic limbs. Several carts are commercially available for para-
plegic dogs of all sizes and can be found on the Internet. Dogs
with permanent paralysis must be monitored and treated for
cystitis but can live otherwise active lives. Lifestyle changes as
outlined in Table 12-5 are recommended.

Advice to Dog Owners: Strategies to Reduce the Chances Or
Effects of Future Intervertebral Disk Disease
Do's
·Reduce weight if obese
· Feed a well-balanced diet.
● Provide daily antioxidant supplementation of vitamin E 10-25 IU/kg and vitamin C
15 mg/kg
●Use a harness instead of a collar.
● Can go for daily walks on a leash (after recovery)
·Can do obedience training (no jumping)
Don'ts
● No jumping on and off furniture, running down stairs, sitting up to beg.
or dancing on the hind legs.
●No playing frisbee or "tug of war," chasing balls, shaking toys, or participating in
other activities that cause quick, sharp turns of the neck or back.
●No rough play with other dogs.
●No agility training that necessitates jumping or climbing.
· No jogging and "road work" behind a vehicle.
Spinal Cord Trauma
 Acute spinal cord trauma most commonly results from
fractures, subluxation, or luxation of the vertebrae. The diagnosis
of trauma is often apparent from the history and physical exami-
nation. Life-threatening problems, such as shock and
hemorrhage, are treated, and a thorough physical examination is
performed to identify the extent of nonneural injuries.
Diaphragm or urinary bladder rupture is common in traumatized,
paraplegic dogs. Assessment of voluntary movement, pelvic limb
spinal reflexes, and cutaneous trunci and deep pain responses is
carefully performed to avoid moving the vertebral column. Pain
medication is administered as soon as possible. Ideally, the
patient should be rigidly immobilized on a radiolucent board,
which prevents further damage from excessive movement while
allowing radiographs to be taken with minimal manipulation.
Intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate is adminis-
pauno se sieo pue soop oioaideied on aiqissod se uoos se paian
in Table 12-2.
V When the animal is sedated or anesthetized, the stabilizing
effect of paravertebral muscle tone is lost, and vertebral instability
294
can cause further spinal cord damage. Iwo radiographic views are
imperative to assess the degree of instability at the site of a fracture
or subluxation. Additional imaging is important, even if a lesion
has been detected on routine radiography, to determine the extent
of the lesion, identify additional spinal cord injuries remote from
the obvious lesion, and to plan surgical intervention. The degree of
spinal cord compression and edema can be visualized on myelog
    q   1 )    
fractures not visible on routine radiographs.
Figure 12-8 Lateral myelogram of a 1-year-old mixed-breed dog thathad been
paraplegic with deep pain for 1 month; note the spinal cord compression from a
fracture subluxation of L1-2 (arrow); surgical decompression and stabilization
were performed (Figures 12-9 and 12-10), and the dog became ambulatory in
the pelvic limbs in 3 months.
 If significant hemorrhage, bone fragments, or other space-
occupying lesions are found within the spinal canal,
hemilaminectomy or dorsal laminectomy and decompression of
the spinal cord may be necessary (Figures 12-6 and 12-7). Visible
vertebral fractures or subluxation should be surgically stabilized.
Steinmann pins or orthopedic screws and polymethyl methacrylate
are typically used to stabilize the vertebrae (Figures 12-9 and 12-10).
If hemorrhage but no spinal cord compression is present, recovery
from spinal trauma can be achieved through the medical approach
outlined in Table 12-3. Placement of a brace or cast to stabilize the
    s     sm
provides some support. Adequate analgesia should be provided at all
times as outlined in Section 7, Table 7-2.
295
pins and polymethyl methacrylate were used.

12-8:pins and polymethyl methacrylatewere used.
296
V Postoperative nursing care and physical therapy are outlined
in Table 12-4. The prognosis for recovery for paraparetic and
Improvement often continues for 9 to 12 months. The prognosis
for animals with paraplegia and no deep pain response as a result
of injury is often worse than that for IVDD because of the degree
of traumatic forces upon the spinal cord. As discussed for IVDD
if there is no response to deep pain for more than a month, para-
plegic dogs are unlikely to recover function. Voluntary
movement, which indicates improvement of function, must be
distinguished from spinal walking, which occurs 1 to 2 months
after injury. Animals with permanent paraplegia may adapt to a
cart as suggested for IVDD. Spinal fractures that occur sponta-
neously or with minimal trauma should be evaluated for the
presence of an underlying neoplasm (pathologic fractures).
Fibrocartilaginous Embolism
 A common cause of asymmetric paraparesis or paraplegia in
large dogs is spinal cord infarction from fibrocartilaginous emboli
(FCE). Small dogs and cats are affected less frequently. Clinical
signs develop acutely and progress rapidly (within 1 to 2 hours)
to unilateral or bilateral paraplegia (Figure 12-11). The diagnosis
and treatment of FCE are presented in Section 9. Infarction of
T3-L3 has a good prognosis for recovery. If unilateral infarction

297
of L4-S2 occurs with absent spinal reflexes in one pelvic limb,
recovery is possible but slow. If bilateral infarction of L4-S2
occurs and no pelvic limb spinal reflexes or response to deep
pain are present, the prognosis for complete recovery can be
poor. Even if some limb function recovers, the ability to volun-
tarily urinate can remain permanently impaired.
Meningomyelitis
V Inflammation of the spinal cord due to canine distemper virus,
toxoplasmosis, neosporosis, rickettsia, fungi, bacteria, and immune-
mediated dysfunction rarely cause acute onset of paraplegia. Such
inflammatory processes are more commonly associated with diseases
that have a chronic, progressive course. Diagnosis and treatment of
inflammation of the nervous system are discussed in Section 2.
Neoplasia
V Spinal cord neoplasia rarely presents as acute paraplegia unless a
pathologic vertebral fracture or spinal cord hemorrhage or infarc-
tion has occurred. Spinal cord neoplasia is discussed in Section 10.

Diagnostic Evaluation
Important Historical Questions
● Onset, course and duration of signs—progression over weeks
or months?
· Is the animal in pain?
● Difficulty rising in the pelvic limbs?
● Difficulty going up stairs or jumping onto furniture or into
the car?
· Have there been previous episodes of paraparesis?
· Change in tail carriage?
● Past or present neoplasia?
● Is urinary or fecal incontinence present?
· Can the animal urinate voluntarily?
● Any signs of systemic illness?
· Any recent or current medications?
· Is the dog doing agility training or other work involving
climbing or jumping?
● Effectiveness of attempted therapies?
303
Physical and Neurologic
Examinations
V Localize the lesion to T3-L3 or L4-S2 (includes neuromus-
cular lesions).
V Determine the severity of signs; in order of progressive
severity: ataxia, paraparesis, paraplegia with deep pain response,
paraplegia with no deep pain response (Section 12, Table 12-1).
Most animals are presented at the paraparesis stage as this
progresses over a week or more.
V Evaluate the thoracic limbs carefully as a cervical or diffuse
neuromuscular lesion can appear to only affect the pelvic limbs.
V Determine the source of pain, if any.
V If urinary incontinence is present, determine whether the
bladder is easy or difficult to express.
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, and
urinalysis are performed to detect systemic illness and as part of
the preanesthetic evaluation.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultra-
sonography are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or
abnormalities are found on the physical examination.
V Tests for which the animal must be anesthetized as well as
their potential findings are as follows:
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show leukocytic pleo-
cytosis with or without elevated protein levels in cases of
meningomyelitis; lumbar CSF may have more significant abnor-
malities than does cerebellomedullary CSF
· CSF analysis may show elevated protein in IVDD, degenera
tive myelopathy, spinal cord neoplasia, and some lysosomal
storage disorders. Lumbar CSF may show the greatest changes.
· CSF cholinesterase levels are elevated in German shepherd
degenerative myelopathy.
● Electromyography (EMG) may show positive sharp waves
and fibrillation potentials in the paravertebral, limb, or tail
muscles in the area of a focal lesion; EMG may detect
multifocal lesions or a generalized neuromuscular disorder.
· Spinal cord evoked potentials may be abnormal.
304
● Routine vertebral column radiographs often show calcified
intervertebral disks, diskospondylitis, and vertebral malforma-
tions or neoplasia; spondylosis deformans and dural ossification
are usually incidental findings in older animals.
· Myelography is useful to detect spinal cord compression from
IVDD, neoplasia, vertebral abnormalities, and cysts or to
demonstrate spinal cord expansion from neoplasia.
· Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) can be useful to evaluate IVDD, diskospondylitis,
vertebral and spinal cord neoplasia, vertebral anomalies, cysts,
and lumbosacral degeneration.
· Surgical exploration of the spinal canal can enable removal
or biopsy of masses for histologic examination.
· Muscle and nerve biopsy is obtained if a neuromuscular lesion
is suspected.
V Serum and CSF titers for organisms or cultures are obtained if
meningomyelitis is suspected.
V Urine and blood cultures are obtained if diskospondylitis
is suspected.
Spinal Cord Disorders
Degenerative Intervertebral
Disk Disease
 The most common cause of chronic progressive paraparesis in
dogs is Hansen Type II IVDD. Middle-aged or older nonchon-
drodystrophic, large-breed dogs, like German shepherds and
Labrador retrievers, are most commonly affected, although any
breed of dog and geriatric cats may be affected. As discussed in
Section 7, the anulus fibrosus slowly protrudes into the spinal
canal with Type II IVDD and compresses the spinal cord
(Section 7, Figure 7-5). In some instances, spinal cord compres-
sion is partially or solely related to hypertrophy of the dorsal
anulus fibrosus and the dorsal longitudinal ligament. Chronic
Type II IVDD often occurs at the more mobile points of the
vertebral column, such as the thoracolumbar and the
lumbosacral regions. Type II IVDD rarely occurs between T1-T10
because the conjugal (intercapital) ligament between the rib
heads reinforces the region immediately dorsal to the disk.
305
V Initial clinical signs may be weakness on rising, reluctance to
jump into the car or onto the furniture, and difficulty climbing
stairs. Although acute exacerbations are possible, clinical signs
usually reflect a chronic, progressive, focal spinal cord lesion and
include asymmetric or symmetric pelvic limb ataxia, paraparesis,
conscious proprioceptive deficits (Figure 13-3), and focal hyper-
pathia. In some animals, no evidence of hyperpathia can be found,
so it can be difficult to differentiate Type II IVDD from degenera-
tive myelopathy on initial clinical evaluation. Fecal and urinary
incontinence may also be present.
Figure 13-3 Loss of conscious propri-
oception helps differentiate orthopedic
and spinal cord disease in dogs with
mild paraparesis; conscious proprio-
ception is reduced or absent in spinal
cord disease and usually normal in
orthopedic disease.
 Elevated protein levels with normal leukocyte counts and
cytologic findings are common on lumbar CSF analysis. Positive
sharp waves and fibrillation potentials may be found in affected
paravertebral, limb, and tail musculature on EMG and can help
determine whether more than one site is involved. Routine radi-
ographs may show spondylosis deformans and bony proliferation of
the dorsal articular facets, or they may be normal. Dural ossification
may be an incidental radiographic finding. Calcification of the
nucleus pulposus and narrowed disk spaces are rarely seen on routine
radiographs of animals with Type II IVDD, and myelography, CT, or
MRI is necessary to document spinal cord compression. Severe
compression may be found in animals with only mild to moderate
paraparesis, as the spinal cord can adjust to slow rates of compression
and neurologic signs may develop only after it can no longer
compensate. Myelography is the most efficient technique to outline
multiple thoracolumbar and cervical lesions. Paraparesis may be
worse (usually transiently) following myelography so MRI is preferred
if the lesion can be well localized. The treatment of Type HI IVDD
can be medical, surgical, or both and depends on the factors
outlined in Table 13-1.

Intervertebral Disk Disease

Economicsituationof theclient
 If an elderly animal is in good physical condition, has no
concurrent significant medical problems, and has only a single
disk protrusion, surgical intervention should not be excluded on
the basis of age alone. Animals with paraparesis from a single
lesion that has progressed over a few weeks tend to do better
with surgery than those with signs that have been progressing for
several months or longer. Surgery may not be beneficial for long-
term compression, as spinal cord atrophy is often irreversible. If
an animal with a focal disk protrusion responds well to pred-
nisone therapy, then decompressive surgery may be more likely to
be effective. Medical management of Type II IVDD is outlined
in Table 13-2. The use of carprofen (Rimadyl, Pfizer), etodolac
(Etogesic, Fort Dodge), buffered aspirin, or other nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be discontinued
during prednisone therapy. Unfortunately, when prednisone is
discontinued, clinical signs often return, as spinal cord compres-
sion is still present. Rest is not essential as in Type I IVDD
because exercise does not worsen the protrusion, and moderate
exercise, such as walking or swimming, is important in elderly
animals. If possible, surgical decompression of the spinal cord
offers a better long-term solution than does prednisone therapy.
Referral for alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, herbs,
massage, and other forms of physical therapy, should also be
considered. However, prednisone may have to be discontinued as
it may inhibit their effectiveness.
V As discussed in Section 12, the type of surgery is usually
determined by the location of the protrusion. Hemilaminectomy
is usually performed for protrusions between vertebrae T1O-L4,
and dorsal laminectomy is done for protrusions caudal to L4
(Section 12, Figures 12-6 and 12-7). A Type II disk can be very
firm and may have to be excised with a scalpel. Surgery for
chronic Type HI IVDD often requires more manipulation of the
meninges and spinal cord than is needed in acute Type I disk
307
extrusions. As a result, paresis is often more severe after surgery.
However, this is usually a temporary setback and the long-term
prognosis is very good to excellent in most cases. The postopera-
tive nursing care and physical therapy are similar to that
described in Section 12 for acute paraplegia and are outlined in
Table 13-3.
Table 13-2
Medical Management of Type Il Thoracolumbar
Intervertebral Disk Disease
● Permit moderate exercise, such as walking and swimming.
● Avoid jumping, going up and down stairs, or rough play.
●Administer prednisone 0.25-1 mg/kg P0 every 12 hours with tapered doses over
30 days. If improvement is noted but relapse occurs when the dose is reduced,
increase the dose again and recommend surgery. If surgery is not an option, con-
tinue with the lowest dose of prednisone that will control the signs (preferably
alternate-day therapy).
● Oral famotidine (Pepcid AC, Merck) 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours, cimetidine
(Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham) 5-10 mg/kg every 12 hours, misoprostol (Cytotec,
Searyl) 1-3 μug/kg every 8 hours or other Gl protectant may be given to reduce gas-
trointestinal upset from the prednisone.
● Administer diazepam 0.5-2 mg/kg P0 every 6-8 hours as needed (not to exceed
10 mg every 6 hours) if muscle spasms are present.
●Pain is unlikely to be severe, but if needed, conduct pain management as out-
lined in Chapter 7, Table 7-2.
Warning: Prednisone therapy often causes polyuria/polydipsia, polyphagia,
and panting. Give extra water but feed a smaller amount of a high-quality.
low-calorie diet because the dog will not be able to exercise as much as in the
past. Long-term corticosteroid therapy can cause gastrointestinal ulcers,
hepatopathy, and myopathy.
Warning: Never use carproden (Rimadyl), etodolac (Etogesic), buffered
aspirin, or other non-steroidal antinflammatory drugs in combination
with prednisone or other corticosteroids as gastrointestinal ulcers and
perforation can lead to death.

● Feed a well-balanced diet, and have water readily available
● Massage and perform passive range-of-motion exercises of the pelvic limbs for 15
minutes 2-3 times a day
● Assist attempts to stand and support weight 3-4 times a day: may use a hoist
● Whirlpool baths and swimming can begin 5-7 days after surgery.
● Sling walks can begin when some movement returns
Degenerative Myelopathy
V German shepherd degenerative myelopathy (GSDM) is seen
   s t   a so   
13-1). Similar degenerative myelopathies (DMs) occur in boxers,
Pembroke Welsh corgis, Belgian tervurens, Old English
sheepdogs, Rhodesian ridgebacks, Weimaraners, Great Pyrenees
mountain dogs, and other large-breed dogs within the same age
range. However, fewer data are available in these dogs, so it is
difficult to determine whether the pathophysiologic process is
the same as that of GSDM. DM has also been reported in cats.
The exact cause of GSDM is unknown, but an immune-mediated
disease process is suspected.
Y Nonpainful pelvic limb ataxia and paresis are seen. These
signs progress over several months and may have a waxing and
waning course. Weakness evident on rising may be the first indi
cation of a problem. As many German shepherds and other large
breeds commonly develop osteoarthritis of the hips and stifles
and spondylosis deformans, difficulty rising may be attributed to
discomfort associated with these disorders. If reduced or absent
conscious proprioception is found in one or both pelvic limbs,
then a neurologic disorder is likely (Figure 13-3). As DM
progresses, ataxia and paraparesis are obvious, and pelvic limb
spinal reflexes are normal or hyperactive, indicating a spinal cord
lesion between'I3-L3. Patellar reflexes may become depressed or
309
absent due to degeneration of axons in the dorsal root later in
the disease process. Affected dogs finally become unable to rise
or walk with the pelvic limbs and develop urinary and fecal
incontinence. Severe paraparesis typically develops within 3 to 6
months after identification of GSDM. The thoracic limbs can
become progressively involved, leading to quadriparesis within 9.
12 months and finally the animal succumbs from respiratory
paralysis. Few patients with GSDM survive beyond 18 months
without treatment.
 Since German shepherds and other large-breed dogs also
commonly develop Type II IVDD and lumbosacral degeneration,
DM must be differentiated from these and other spinal cord
disorders. Some German shepherds may have GSDM concur
rently with other spinal cord disorders. Radiographs of the
vertebral column may be normal or show concurrent spondylosis
deformans. Myelography is unremarkable in DM. However,
affected dogs may be more paretic (usually transiently) after
myelography, and MRI may be preferred to rule out Type HI
IVDD and other causes of paraparesis. Spinal cord evoked poten-
tials can confirm spinal cord dysfunction. Diagnosis of DM is
suspected after ruling out other causes of chronic progressive
paraparesis. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of GSDM are
outlined in Table 13-4. Other animals with DM may have similar
findings. A definitive diagnosis of DM can only be achieved with
histologic examination of the spinal cord obtained at necropsy.

●Neuroimaging (routine radiography, myelography, CT, routine MRI):

310
 Elevated CSF cholinesterase, interleukin 6, and ubiquitin
concentrations suggest the presence of inflammation in GSDM.
The clinical stage and severity of GSDM correlate with
depressed lymphocyte blastogenesis to plant mitogens, resulting
from the genesis of circulating suppressor cells. Some dogs with
GSDM also exhibit antigen-binding cells specific to canine
myelin basic protein. Increased circulating immune-complexes in
the serum and CSF are similar to other inflammatory diseases
and are not specific to GSDM. The treatment of GSDM is
directed at controlling the inflammatory processes associated with
the underlying immune disorder and is outlined in Table 13-5. This
treatment may also be helpful in other dogs with DM.
Table 13-5
Treatment of German Shepherd Degenerative Myelopathy

● Oral N-Acetylcysteine 25 mg/kg every 8 hours daily for 2 weeks then reduced

●OralvitaminE1000-2000IUonceortwicedaily

· High-quality. balanced diet

blood vessels of the spinal cord and cause deposition of fibrin in the
perivascular spaces. Fibrin degradation attracts inflammatory cells into
the lesions, causing further tissue damage. Epsilon aminocaproic acid
(EACA) is an antifibrinolytic agent that reduces the inflammation
associated with fibrin degradation. EACA causes gastric irritation and
should be given with food to prevent nausea and vomiting.
 The inflammatory cells release prostaglandins and cytokines,
which ultimately lead to the formation of oxygen-containing free
radicals that further damage the tissues. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a
potent antioxidant that prevents free radical-induced tissue destruc-
tion. NAC comes as a 2O% solution and must be diluted with
chicken broth (or other compatible water substitute) to 5% and given
with food to prevent nausea and vomiting. Some compounding phar
macies may be able to formulate medications at a reduced cost.
Therapeutic doses of oral vitamin E and vitamin C can also be given
to reduce tissue damage from oxygen containing free radicals. As
311
high doses of vitamin C may induce diarrhea, low doses are initially
given then increased if tolerated. High doses of vitamin E may
inhibit coagulation and should be avoided in animals with coagu-
lopathies. Treatment with EACA, NAC, and vitamins E and C is
aimed at slowing the progression of GSDM or achieving remission.
Almost all GSDM patients show some short-term benefit from
EACA and antioxidant therapy. Remission has been seen in cases
treated early in the course of disease. Dogs with GSDM may live
long enough to develop other age-related problems. Periodic assess-
ments of their general health are important.
 Diet may have a powerful influence on the development of
chronic degenerative diseases and should be closely monitored.
Complementary therapies may prolong life and increase its
quality. Many dogs with DM develop severe paraparesis and
incontinence despite all treatment attempts. A cart can be used

euthanasia prior to this stage when quality of life becomes poor.
found, especially in the thoracolumbar spinal cord (Figure 13-4).
Nearly all funiculi are vacuolated. Similar lesions are occasion-
ally seen scattered throughout the white matter of the brain.
Many patients have evidence of plasma cell infiltrates in the
kidneys or throughout the gastrointestinal tract, providing a hint
to the underlying immune disorder that causes GSDM.
Immunoglobulins and complement are found in the spinal cord
lesions of dogs with this disorder.

312
Lumbosacral Degeneration
V Pain associated with lumbosacral degeneration (LSD) may
cause difficulty in rising, jumping into the car or onto furniture,
and going up stairs. On occasion, compression of L7-S1 nerve
roots may result in paraparesis with atrophy of the semimembra
nosis, semitendinosis, gastrocnemius, and cranial tibial muscles.
Dogs with LSD initially have lumbosacral pain, and diagnosis
and treatment are discussed in Section 7. Later in the course of
the disease the nerve roots to the bladder, anus, and tail are
primarily affected (Section 15).
Meningomyelitis
V Meningomyelitis and myelitis can cause chronic progressive
paraparesis and are associated with infectious organisms as well as
an unknown inflammatory process. Myelitis associated with the
canine distemper virus can cause paraparesis that progresses to
paraplegia within a few weeks, and the thoracic limbs may be
normal or only mildly paretic. Meningomyelitis and myelitis often
cause acute and chronic quadriparesis (see Sections 9 and 10). The
diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of central nervous system
inflammation are discussed in Section 2, Tables 2-8 to 2-11.
Diskospondyl
Titis
V Back pain is the most common initial clinical sign of thora-
columbar diskospondylitis, and difficulty rising in the pelvic limbs
is often associated with pain rather than paresis. If diskospondylitis
is left untreated, progressive ataxia and paraparesis can result from
spinal cord compression due to inflammation and swelling of the
intervertebral disk and surrounding tissues. Diagnosis, treatment,
and prognosis of diskospondylitis are discussed in Section 7.
Hemivertebra and Other
Vertebral Malformations
V Vertebral malformations are seen most commonly in the thoracic
vertebral column of brachycephalic dogs, such as Boston terriers, pugs,
and English and French bulldogs. Such malformations include
hemivertebrae (Figure 13-5), butterfly vertebra, transitional vertebrae,
and block vertebrae. Although usually an incidental radiographic
finding, these malformations occasionally cause scoliosis and compres-
sion of the spinal cord. Ataxia and paraparesis may worsen as the
animal grows as a result of increasing compression or tethering
313
(stretching from tying down of the cauda equina) of the spinal cord.
The lesion may not necessarily cause pain. Although vertebral malfor
mation is obvious on routine radiographs, spinal cord compression is
visualized with myelography and CT or MRI (Figure 13-6).
Decompression of the spinal cord can be attempted but may worsen
the paraparesis or paraplegia. Some animals with chronic compres-
sion have concurrent syringomyelia, hydromyelia, or spinal cord
atrophy, which complicates therapy and recovery.
V Spina bifida or incomplete fusion of the dorsal spinous process may
be found on routine radiography and CT. Myelography or MRI may
demonstrate a meningeal sac (meningocele) protruding through the
dorsal opening in the vertebra. Progressive paraparesis can result.
Spina bifida is most common in the sacral region (Section 15) but
occurs in the thoracic area as well.

314
Neoplasia
V Vertebral osteochondromas are benign, proliferative masses of
cartilage and bone that occur at metaphyseal growth plates.
Osteochondromas of the thoracolumbar vertebrae may compress
the spinal cord and cause progressive paraparesis in young, growing
animals. Occurrence at multiple skeletal sites is referred to as
multiple cartilaginous exostoses. Pain can often be localized to the
site of the lesion. Radiodense circular lesions protruding from the
vertebra into the spinal canal may be seen on routine vertebral
column radiographs. Myelography and MRI document spinal cord
compression. CT with or without myelography can be useful to
show the extent of the osteochondroma.
 Growth of the osteochondroma may stop when the animal
reaches skeletal maturity. Those without spinal cord compression
may not require therapeutic intervention. However, for para-
paretic animals with significant spinal cord compression from
osteochondroma, decompressive laminectomy with removal of
the mass results in improvement of the paraparesis and recovery
within a few months. Histologic examination of the mass is
important to confirm the diagnosis and to differentiate osteochon.
droma from a malignant neoplasm. Malignant transformation of
osteochondromas is rare but has been reported in dogs
Osteochondromas may be an inherited disorder in dogs.
vertebral or extradural, intradural, or intramedullary spinal cord
tumor. Tumors of the vertebrae and those that affect the meninges
and nerve roots cause pain and are described in Section 7.
Lymphoma commonly causes painful progressive paraparesis in cats.
Neoplastic lymphocytes may be found on analysis of lumbar CSF
Myelography and MRI demonstrate spinal cord compression and
aspiration of the mass can be attempted for cytologic evaluation.
 Surgical resection of the mass followed by chemotherapy or
radiation therapy may improve paresis and prolong the survival
time of both dogs and cats with spinal cord neoplasia. Diagnosis
and treatment of spinal cord tumors are discussed in Section 10.
Spinal Cord Cysts
V Epidermoid, dermoid, and arachnoid cysts may compress the
spinal cord and cause progressive paraparesis or quadriparesis,
depending on their location, in dogs and cats. During fetal develop
ment, adjacent skin-determining ectoderm and mesoderm remain
attached to the neural tube and become enclosed in the meninges,
315
brain, or spinal cord as they form. Epidermoid cysts are lined with
squamous cell epithelium, contain keratin and a few inflammatory
cells, and are usually intramedullary (located within the spinal
cord). Dermoid cysts have a more complex wall and are filled with
sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and hair follicles. A dermoid cyst
may have a draining tract that communicates with the skin; such
cysts are called a dermoid sinus. Although dermoid cysts are
common in Rhodesian ridgebacks, they rarely cause spinal cord
compression and paraparesis. Arachnoid cysts usually form in the
meninges on the dorsal midline and can cause intradural-
extramedullary compression of the spinal cord; they may also be an
incidental finding. Arachnoid cysts are filled with CSF. Spinal
dysraphia (incomplete closure of the neural tube) may accompany
arachnoid cysts, as a congenital defect. Clinical signs may occur in
adult dogs, indicating that the cysts may enlarge over time.
V Cysts may be visible on myelography, and CT following myel-
ography may further delineate the degree of spinal cord
compression. MRI is superior to visualize the extent of the cyst
and associated spinal dysraphia.
Y Decompressive surgery through dorsal laminectomy (see
Section 12, Figure 12-7) and removal of an arachnoid cyst may
result in complete recovery. Epidermoid cysts may be more
       
neurologic signs may recur.
Lysosomal Storage Disorders
V Lysosomal storage disorders result from congenital absence or
inactivity of a specific lysosomal enzyme. The substrate normally
metabolized by that enzyme accumulates within cells, ultimately
causing their death. The clinical signs vary with different enzyme
deficiencies. The types of lysosomal storage disorders that cause
progressive paraparesis are listed in Section 2, Table 2-15. There
is no treatment.
Neuromuscular Disorders
Polyradiculoneuritis/Myositis
V Puppies as young as 4 weeks of age may develop progressive
asymmetric or symmetric paraparesis and a “bunny-hopping" gait
from Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum infections of the
lumbosacral nerve roots and muscles (polyradiculomyositis).
316
Although affected limbs have no spinal reflexes, they are stiff
because of muscle fibrosis and tendon contracture. Diffuse fibrilla-
tion potentials and trains of positive sharp waves are found in the
lumbar paravertebral and pelvic limb musculature. CSF analysis
may show leukocytic pleocytosis and/or an elevated protein level.
The diagnosis is suspected from the history and clinical findings,
but serum and CSF immunoassays and histologic examination of a
muscle biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Serum titers for T. gondii
and N. caninum may be elevated. A polymerase chain reaction test
for the organisms may be more sensitive if available. Organisms are
occasionally found within muscle biopsy sections.
V Early treatment with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine 15-3O mg/kg
PO every 12 hours or ormetoprim-sulfadimethoxine (Primor,
Pfizer) 15 mg/kg PO every 12 hours and clindamycin (Antirobe,
Pfizer) 5-10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours may result in some
improvement. Pyrimethamine (Daraprim, Glaxo Wellcome)
0.5-1.0 mg/kg PO once daily for 3 days then reduced to 0.25
mg/kg once daily for 14 days may be added to trimethoprim-
sulfadiazine or ormetoprim-sulfadimethoxine therapy.
Pyrimethamine may cause bone marrow suppression in small
animals so blood counts must be carefully monitored.
Improvement with early treatment may be seen, but recovery is
often incomplete
Other Polyneuropathies
and Polymopathies
to affect only the pelvic limbs and cause chronic progressive
paraparesis with little thoracic limb paresis. The patellar reflex
may be the only spinal reflex that is depressed or absent on the
neurologic examination. Conscious proprioceptive deficits in the
pelvic limbs and loss of the cutaneous trunci response often
occur in animals with polyneuropathy. However, conscious
proprioception and spinal reflexes are often normal in animals
with polymyopathies. Positive waves and fibrillation potentials
may be found in all paravertebral and pelvic and thoracic limb
musculature on EMG.'Ihe diagnosis is confirmed by histologic
examination of a nerve or muscle biopsy. Chronic progressive
polyneuropathies are discussed in Section 1o, because they even-
tually produce quadriparesis, and polymyopathies in Section 11,
because they are often associated with episodic or exercise-
induced weakness.

Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and urinal-
ysis are performed to detect systemic illness and as part of the
preanesthetic evaluation.
√ Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultra-
sonography are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or if
abnormalities are found on the physical examination.
V Thoracic radiographs show cardiac enlargement with or
without pulmonary edema in cats with cardiomyopathy.
V A Doppler-flow sensing device placed on the dorsomedial
region of the metatarsals or the palmer surface of the metacarpals
can be used to evaluate blood flow in distal limbs
V Electrocardiography and echocardiography can be useful to
evaluate cardiomyopathy
V Coagulation tests, such as activated clotting times (ACT),
prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT),
may be indicated for animals with thromboembolism and no
evidence of cardiac disease.
V The animal is anesthetized for the following tests; their
potential findings are also noted:
● Electromyography (EMG) may show positive sharp waves
and fibrillation potentials in the paravertebral and limb muscles
associated with specific nerve involvement 7 to 10 days after
onset of clinical signs.
· Nerve stimulation can be performed 72 hours after onset of
clinical signs to determine nerve integrity.
● Routine radiographs may show calcified intervertebral disks,
narrowed disk spaces, vertebral fractures or neoplasia.
· Myelography can be used to diagnose spinal cord compression
from an intervertebral disk extrusion or protrusion or a nerve
root tumor that may be growing through the intervertebral fora-
men into the spinal canal.
· Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) can be useful to detect nerve root tumors, interverte-
bral disk disease, vertebral fractures, hemorrhage, or fibrocarti-
laginous embolism.

Disorders Causing
Monoplegia or
Monoparesis
Nerve Root, Plexus,
or Nerve Trauma
 Trauma is the most common cause of acute monoparesis or mono-
plegia. Injury of the brachial plexus and subsequent paralysis of one
thoracic limb is the most common type of trauma and is frequently
seen after motor vehicle accidents (Figure 14-1). If the nerve roots of
the brachial plexus are torn from the spinal cord (avulsion), Horner's
syndrome of the eye, and loss of the cutaneous trunci reflex on the
same side as the monoplegia are usually present (Section 6, Figure 6
8). In some cases of brachial plexus injury, the musculocutaneous
nerve is spared and the limb is held flexed at the elbow. The type of
nerve injuries and prognosis are outlined in Table 14-3.
Table 14-3
Types of Nerve Injury and Prognosis
● Neurapraxia (axonapraxia): Failure of nerve function in the absence of
structural change due to blunt trauma, compression, or ischemia; return to
functionnormallyensues.
·Axonotmesis:Disruption of the axon and myelin sheath with preservation of
connective tissue fragments, resulting in degeneration of the axon distal to the
injury site (Wallerian degeneration); regeneration of the axon is spontaneous and
often of good quality
· Neurotmesis: Partial or complete severance of a nerve, with disruption of the
axon, its myelin sheath, and the connective tissue elements; regeneration can-
not occur unless the nerve segments are surgically reattached.
V Most nerve injuries are caused by neurapraxia or neurapraxia
and axonotmesis combined. Initially, all types of nerve injury can
cause monoplegia with loss of superficial and deep pain sensa-
tions. If the deep pain response is present in all the digits, then
the nerve is intact and chances for recovery are good. Since the
prognosis varies with the nerve and type of injury, the EMG can
be useful to determine which nerves have been injured and what
type of injury has been sustained (Table 14-4).

 The length of time for neurapraxia to resolve varies with
the severity of the injury and may range from a few days to a few
weeks. Although nerves with axonotmesis can regenerate, the
distance between the site of the nerve injury and muscle must
also be considered in the prognosis. Nerves grow approximately
2.5 cm/month, but after approximately 6 months neural sheath
shrinkage and neurogenic muscle atrophy may inhibit further
progress. Nerves injured greater than 15 cm proximal to the
muscle may not be able to regenerate to the extent necessary to
reach the muscle. If they do, their distal conduction times may
be so slow that function is greatly impaired.
V If EMG is unavailable, serial neurologic examinations can be
performed every month for the first 4 months. If monoplegia
with absent superficial or deep pain response is still present 4
months after the injury, then recovery is unlikely.
CT, or MRI may be useful to identify
concurrent fractures or hemorrhage but can be normal. Physical
therapy is essential for recovery. Tendon contracture can inhibit
normal function even if the nerves regenerate. Manually flexing
and extending affected joints and massaging all affected muscles
for at least 15 minutes three times daily is recommended. If the
limb drags on the ground, it should be placed in a sling tied
around the animal's neck or covered with a protective boot to
prevent injury. Splinting the limb may interfere with circulation
and worsen the muscle damage.
/ If brachial plexus avulsion has occurred, then recovery is
unlikely (Figure 14-3). If the limb is placed in a sling, tendon
contracture will occur within 3 to 6 months. The limb must be
kept flexed so it does not drag on the ground and limb amputa-
amputation for esthetic reasons.

been torn from the spinal cord (arrows)
Fibrocartilaginous Embolism
V A small, unilateral infarction of the gray matter in the C6-T2 or
L4-S2 spinal cord segments can cause paresis or paralysis of what
appears to be just one limb. However, closer neurologic examina-
tion usually shows that the other limbs are affected to a lesser
degree. The diagnosis and prognosis of fibrocartilaginous embolism
of the spinal cord are discussed in Section 9.
Thromboembolism
V Thromboembolism of the aorta or iliac arteries (saddle
thrombus) is common in cats but rare in dogs. This disorder
typically causes acute paraplegia. Occasionally, one pelvic or
thoracic limb may be affected. In cats, thromboembolism is often
associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Coagulation tests,
such as ACT, PT, and PTT, may be abnormal in other animals with
thromboembolism. Tumor emboli can affect the blood supply to a
limb and cause acute monoparesis or monoplegia. Diagnosis and
treatment of thromboembolism are discussed in Section 12.
Degenerative Intervertebral
Disk Disease
V Lameness of one limb that progresses over several days or
weeks to monoparesis, decreased spinal reflexes, and muscle
atrophy may be associated with lateralized Type I or Type II
intervertebral disk extrusion or protrusion (Section 7, Figures 7-4
and 7-5). Neck or back pain is often associated with the limb
dysfunction. The diagnosis is often best made with CT or MRI,
328
as a myelogram may be normal. Surgical removal of the disk
material is usually necessary, and the prognosis for recovery is
excellent. Intervertebral disk disease is discussed further in
Sections 7, 9,10, 12, and 13.
Neoplasia
V Lameness of one limb that progresses over several weeks or months
to paresis, reduction of spinal reflexes, and muscle atrophy may be
associated with neoplasia of the nerve roots, plexus, or individual
nerves. Pain is often detected on palpation of the neck, axilla, back,
or inguinal regions, and paresis of other limbs often develops with
time. Tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath (neurofibroma, schwan-
noma, neurofibrosarcoma) are the most common neoplasms
identified. The diagnosis can be elusive until the tumor reaches a
detectable size. The EMG can be useful to identify the presence of a
nerve root or peripheral nerve disorder in animals with lameness and
to determine which nerves are affected. Enlarged nerves may be visu
alized with MRI (Figure 14-4). Treatment of peripheral nerve sheath
tumors entails removal of the tumor and nerve. However, if a plexus
or many nerve roots are affected (Figure 14-5), then complete
removal is often difficult and the tumor eventually grows into the
spinal cord, causing quadriparesis or paraparesis (Section 10, Figures
10-4 and 10-5). Therefore, the prognosis for tumors of the plexus or
nerve roots is guarded.

V Treatment is aimed at controlling the pain (Section 7, Table
7-2). Gabapentin (Neurontin, Parke-Davis) 6 to 15 mg/kg PO
every 6 hours may be useful to reduce nerve pain; however, its
expense limits its usefulness in veterinary medicine. Other new
anticonvulsant drugs, like tiagabine, may be useful to control
nerve pain in the future. Lymphosarcoma can infiltrate nerve
roots, and other neoplastic processes may compress nerves and
cause progressive paresis on one limb. Neoplasia of vertebrae can
affect nerve roots and is discussed in Section 7. Other extradural
and extramedullary spinal cord neoplams can affect nerve roots
and cause monoparesis and are discussed in Section 10.

● Painful or nonpainful?
· Is tail carriage normal?
● Does the tail wag?
· Is there straining to urinate or defecate?
· How frequent is bladder and/or bowel incontinence?
· Does the animal seem aware of the incontinence?
● Possibility of trauma? If so cbtain lumbosacral radiographs.
● History of fighting or animal bites?
· Past or present neoplasia?
· Manx cat or bulldog with signs since birth?
· Lame in the pelvic limbs?
● Difficulty rising, going up stairs, or jumping onto furniture or
into the car?
● Any other sign of systemic illness or neurologic dysfunction?
· Current or recent medications or other treatments and
their effectiveness?
Physical Examination
V Look for evidence of bite wounds or other traumatic lesions.
V Evaluate for pain in the lumbosacral region.
Neurologic Examination
One or more of the following will be found during the neurologic
examination:
V Difficulty rising in the pelvic limbs and climbing stairs
V Lame in a pelvic limb
V Uncurling of the tail
V Low tail carriage
V Loss of tail wagging
V Reduced tail tone
V Reduced or absent tail sensation
√ Dilated anus
334
V Reduced or absent anal reflex
V Lack of anal sphincter contraction on rectal palpation
V Reduced or absent perineal sensation
√ Pain on palpation of the dorsal lumbosacral vertebrae
V Pain on palpation of ventral surface of the lumbosacral
vertebrae (per rectum)
V Large bladder that is easy to express in dogs but may be difficult
to express in cats
V Loss of the micturition reflex
V Dribbling urine from the overflow of an engorged bladder
Applicable Diagnostic Tests
V A complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and urinalysis
can be useful to detect systemic illness and as part of the preanes-
thetic evaluation.
V Thoracic and abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultrasonog-
raphy are indicated if neoplasia is suspected or abnormalities are
found on the physical examination. Abdominal radiographs and
ultrasonography may detect caudal sublumbar masses.
V The animal is anesthetized for the following tests; their
potential results are also given:
· An electromyogram (EMG) may show positive sharp waves
and fibrillation potentials in the caudal gluteal, perineal, and
tail muscles associated with specific nerve involvement 5 to 7
days after signs initially appear.
· Nerve stimulation of the cauda equina can be performed, and
evoked muscle potentials from the tail and anal sphincter are
recorded to evaluate the integrity of the caudal and sacral nerve
roots and nerves.
● Routine lumbosacral radiographs can demonstrate sacrocau
dal agenesis, spina bifida, spondylosis deformans, diskospondyli-
tis, fractures or luxations, and vertebral neoplasia.
· Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show neu-
trophilic pleocytosis in bacterial infections or elevated protein
in compression lesions.
· A myelogram may be useful to diagnose spinal cord
compression from lumbosacral degeneration or a nerve root
tumor, but contrast media may not descend caudally to outline
the cauda equina. The extent of a meningocele may be deter.
mined with myelography.
335
· An epidurogram may be attempted to outline the cauda
equina, but this test is often more difficult to interpret than
other imaging studies and may be nondiagnostic.
● Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) can be used to evaluate sacrocaudal agenesis, lum-
bosacral degeneration, diskospondylitis, abscesses, vertebral
fractures, fibrocartilaginous embolism and neoplasia.
· Epidural needle aspirates may assist in diagnosing an abscess
or epidural neoplasia, such as lymphosarcoma.
· Aspirates of the lumbosacral intervertebral disk space may be
useful in the diagnosis of diskospondylitis.
V Urine and blood cultures and serum Brucella canis titers are
obtained if diskospondylitis is found.
V Culture and sensitivity of needle aspirates or open biopsy
samples should be performed if an abscess is identified.
Lumbosacral Disorders
Nerve Root Trauma
V Acute nerve root trauma most commonly results from
fractures, luxations, or subluxation of the lumbosacral or sacral
vertebrae. Such trauma is usually secondary to a motor vehicle
accident. Fracture and/or luxation of the sacrocaudal junction
may occur in animals that run when their tail is caught. Paralysis
of the tail and urinary and fecal incontinence often result. While
dogs have a flaccid urinary bladder that is easy to express, the
bladder may be difficult to manually express in cats. Two radi-
ographic views are imperative to assess the degree of
displacement at the fracture site in most cases. CT can be useful
to better visualize bone fragments in the spinal canal. Surgical
decompression and stabilization may be required.
fecal evacuation if necessary. Low-dose propanolol 1.25 mg total
dose PO every 8 to 12 hours may facilitate bladder expression in
cats after several days of therapy. The prognosis is better if tail
and perineal sensation is preserved. Sacrocaudal luxations
(Figure 15-3) typically have a better prognosis for return of
bowel and bladder function than do lumbosacral luxations. The
tail may be permanently paralyzed and may eventually have to be
amputated due to soiling or mutilation.

function did not.
Lumbosacral Degeneration
V Lumbosacral degeneration is common in large-breed dogs, and
as discussed in Section 7, the pain associated with this disorder
usually makes it difficult to rise, climb stairs, or jump onto furniture
or into the car. Chronic joint instability and subluxation, prolifera
tion of the surrounding ligaments and other soft tissues, and a Type
II intervertebral disk protrusion (see Section 7, Figure 7-5) at L7-
Sl produce a stenotic lumbosacral spinal canal.
V Affected dogs initially have low back pain (Section 7) and low
tail carriage. As the disease progresses, paresis or paralysis of the tail
and fecal or urinary incontinence may develop (Figure 15-4). Some
dogs also bite the tail and leg and lick the genitals, which may be
caused by paresthesia. Conscious proprioceptive deficits and pelvic
limb paresis are rarely present. Lumbosacral radiographs and MRI
often show profound changes if urinary and fecal incontinence is
present (Figures 15-5 and 15-6). Surgical decompression of nerve
chances for improvement decline once urinary or fecal inconti-
nence develop. Further discussion of the diagnosis and treatment of
lumbosacral degeneration is found in Section 7.

338
Fibrocartilaginous Embolism
V Infarction of the sacrocaudal spinal cord from fibrocartilagi-
nous emboli (FCE) can cause acute flaccid paralysis of the tail,
anal sphincter, and bladder and occurs most commonly in large.
breed dogs. If the infarction affects the L4-S2 spinal cord region,
paraparesis or paraplegia will occur. Small dogs and cats are
affected less frequently. Diagnosis and treatment of FCE are
presented in Section 9. Although recovery is often possible,
residual urinary and fecal incontinence may occur.
Diskospondylitis
VDiskospondylitis is an infection of the vertebral endplates and
intervertebral disk spaces. Vertebral osteomyelitis, or spondylitis,
is an infectious process that affects the vertebral bodies.
Diskospondylitis and spondylitis are usually caused by bacterial
infection and are infrequently caused by a fungal infection such
as aspergillosis,and migrations of foreign bodies (e.g. grass awns).
Staphylococcal infections are most common and probably gain
entrance by a hematogenous route. Pre-existing or concurrent
skin, urinary tract, or cardiopulmonary infections are often
present. Pain is located at the site of the affected vertebrae.
Multiple vertebral sites may be involved, but the lumbosacral
region is commonly affected (see Section 7, Figures 7-12, 7-13,
and 7-14). If significant inflammation and compression of sacro
caudal nerve roots occurs, then a flaccid tail, anus, and bladder
may result. Diagnosis and treatment of diskospondylitis are
discussed in Section 7.
Sacrocaudal Agenesis

sacrum and associated nerve roots. Spina bifida, or incomplete
closure of the dorsal vertebral arches, is often present. The cauda

cele. Innervation of the anus and bladder is reduced or absent. An
abnormal hair pattern over the dorsal midline of the lumbosacral
region and a palpable absence of the dorsal spinous process of the
sacrum may be found on physical examination (Figure 15-1). There
may be associated malformation of the lumbar spinal cord, so pelvic
limb ataxia or paraparesis may also be present. The sacrocaudal
 agenesis can be seen on routine radiographs and CT or MRI.
339
There is no treatment to correct the malformation in most
animals. Manual bladder expression and assistance to defecate must
be performed. Chronic bladder infections must be treated with
antibiotic therapy.
Bite Wound Abscess
V A flaccid tail, anus, and bladder may be associated with a
focal bacterial epidural abscess of the nerve roots of the cauda
equina secondary to a bite wound around the tailhead. Aspiration
and culture of exudates from the epidural space confirm the
diagnosis and assist in antibiotic selection. Antibiotic therapy for
bacterial infections is described with meningoencephalitis in
Section 2, Table 2-11. Antibiotics should be given for 4 to 6
weeks, and the prognosis for recovery can be good. Laminectomy
for removal of debris is rarely necessary.
Neoplasia
V Neoplasia of the vertebrae, meninges, or nerve roots of the cauda
equina can cause lumbosacral pain as well as flaccid tail, anus, and
bladder. Lymphoma localized in the cauda equina is common in cats
but only occurs occasionally in dogs. Bone and soft tissue changes can
be best visualized with CT and MRI, respectively. Surgical removal,
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy may improve the pain and
prolong the survival time in both dogs and cats with neoplasia
affecting the cauda equina. Diagnosis and treatment of vertebral and
spinal cord tumors are discussed in Sections 7 and 1O; nerve root
neoplasia is discussed in Section 14.

Diagnostic Evaluation
V Because of the diversity of these disorders, the important histor-

possible diagnostic tests will be discussed with each disorder.
Miscellaneous Disorders
Tetanus
 The bacteria Clostridium tetani usually gains entrance to the
body through an external wound, although iatrogenic infection
with improperly sterilized surgical instruments has been reported.
The bacteria release a toxin that blocks inhibitory neurons in
the brainstem and spinal cord, causing focal and generalized
continuous muscle spasms. The characteristic contracture of
facial muscles has been referred to as "risus sardonicus" (Figure
16-1). Masticatory and pharyngeal muscle spasms may lead to
difficulty opening the mouth and dysphagia. Often, the ears are
held erect and the nictitating membranes protrude or rhythmi
cally contract. The limbs may be stiff as well and assume a saw
horse stance. The diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical
appearance. Some dogs and particularly cats may develop focal
tetanus, which causes stiffness or rigidity in one limb.
 Penicillin G procaine at 20,000-50,000 IU/kg IV is given every
4 hours to kill remaining bacteria. To control muscle spasms,
methocarbamol (Robaxin,Robins) 55-220 mg/kg IV(not to
exceed 330 mg/kg/day) may be given. One half the calculated dose
is given rapidly, followed by slow administration after the animal
relaxes. Diazepam 0.5 mg/kg not to exceed 10 mg every 4-6 hours
IV, IM or rectally may be tried if methocarbamol does not control
spasms. A diazepam constant rate infusion may be given as outlined
in Section 3, Table 3-5. Stimulation by touch, light, and sound
often induce muscle spasms and should be avoided. Intravenous
tetanus antitoxin is given as soon as possible after diagnosis. A test
dose of O.1 to O.2 ml SQ of equine origin tetanus antitoxin may be
given, and if no adverse reaction occurs within 30 minutes,
100-1000 IU/kg/day IV is administered for dogs and cats.
Intravenous fluids and supportive care are given until the effects of
the toxin dissipate, which may be weeks. Muscle spasms associated
with mastication, swallowing, and respiration can result in debilita-
tion and necessitate intensive care. Dogs and cats that are focally
affected often recover, but recovery may take weeks.
344
Canine Distemper
Mvoclonus
V A nonpainful, persistent, rhythmic contraction of a group of
muscles, which continues even during sleep, may occur in dogs
with an active or past infection with the canine distemper virus.
The viral infection leads to a pacemaker-like electrical circuit in
the spinal cord. Myoclonus or continuous rhythmic contractions
of facial, masticatory, cervical, limbs, or other muscles can occur.
Other signs of meningoencephalitis may be present (Section 2),
or affected dogs may appear otherwise normal. Procainamide HCl
(Pronestyl, Princeton) 6-8 mg/kg IV given over a 5-minute
period (while monitoring the ECG) will minimize or eliminate
the myoclonus. Procainamide (Procanbid, Monarch) 8-2O mg/kg
PO every 12 hours may reduce myoclonus in mild cases but dogs
should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. Although
some animals can function well as pets, no treatment may be
effective in severely affected animals and euthanasia may be
required. Myoclonus can become less severe over a period of
years after infection.
Muscle Cramping Syndromes
V Scottish terriers may develop a recessively inherited disorder
characterized by muscle cramping with exercise, excitement, or
cold, often before 6 months of age. Controlling environmental
triggers and administering vitamin E 25 IU/kg/day PO may
reduce or eliminate the muscle cramps. Diazepam O.5 mg/kg PO
every 8 hours may be used to control cramping if needed. Similar
conditions have been reported in Dalmatians and Norwich
terriers. Greyhounds may develop severe muscle cramping when
racing after a prolonged period of rest that can lead to rhab.
domyolysis and myoglobinuria. Episodic dyskinesia is associated
with involuntary muscle contractions. Although rare, dyskinesia
can be differentiated from seizures because there is no prodrome,
autonomic signs, or postictal phase, and dyskinesia does not
respond to anticonvulsant drugs. Excitement may initiate muscle
cramping due to polymyopathy in Cavalier King Charles spaniels
(Section 1l). Myotonic myopathies may also cause muscle
cramping and delayed relaxation after excitement (Section 11).
345
Hyperesthesia and
Self-Mutilation
V Feline hyperesthesia syndrome is associated with twitching,
rippling, or rolling of the skin along the thoracolumbar region
These signs are accompanied by vocalization, hysteria, and self
mutilation. Affected cats are hyperesthetic to light touching in the
thoracolumbar region, and this may elicit the clinical signs.
Paresthesias of unknown etiology are suspected to be the cause.
Myopathy of the lumbar muscles has been documented in some
cats, so electromyography and muscle biopsies of this region may be
considered. Obsessive chin rubbing and tail chasing with or
without mutilation are also observed in both dogs and cats. Sensory
neuropathies, myopathies, hormonal imbalances, and psychological
factors have all been suspected as the cause, but the exact
mechanism is unknown. The best therapies appear to be those used
to treat compulsive behavior disorders. Oral imiprimine (Tofranil,
Novartis) 0.5-2 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours in dogs or cats,
clomipramine (Clomacalm, Pfizer) 1-3 mg/kg every 12 hours for
dogs, fluoxetine (Prozac, Dista) 1 mg/kg every 24 hours in dogs, or
buspirone (BuSpar, Bristol Myers Squibb) 2.5-15 mg every 8 to 12
hours in dogs or cats may be tried. Environmental changes, such as
getting the pet a companion, increasing its exercise, or enriching
the environment in other ways, may also alter the behavior.
Behavior modification in conjunction with a pharmacologic
therapy should be considered, although the response varies.
V Congenital sensory neuropathies that results in mutilation of the
paws may occur in English setters, German shorthaired pointers,
Dachshunds, and other dogs. There is no known effective
neuronal damage from the canine distemper or herpes (pseudora-
bies) viruses, an extruded intervertebral disk, trauma, or neoplasia.
Paresthesias are suspected to provoke licking and chewing of the
affected area. Oral diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin, Parke-Davis) 25 to
30 mg/kg every 6 hours in dogs or gabapentin (Neurontin, Parke-
Davis) 6 to 15 mg/kg every 6 hours in dogs may be tried to reduce
the clinical signs associated with acquired sensory neuropathies. The
expense of gabapentin may limit its use. Acupuncture may provide
some relief from suspected paresthesias. Self-mutilation associated
with intervertebral disk extrusion or protrusion, nerve injury, or
neoplasia may improve over time or with correction of the under
lying problem. If the underlying cause of acquired sensory
neuropathy cannot be corrected, the prognosis is usually guarded.

Dancing Doberman Disease
V A breed-specific gastrocnemius myopathy occurs in Doberman
pinschers from 1 to 10 years of age. Initially, one pelvic limb is
affected and when the dog is standing still, the limb is held in
flexion (Figure 16-2). The dog is not lame or paretic and usually
has a normal gait. Over the ensuing months, the second pelvic
limb may become affected, and when standing, the dog will alter.
nately lift each pelvic limb in a dancing motion and then sit
down. Positive sharp waves and fibrillation potentials are often
found during electromyography of the gastrocnemius muscles.
Myodegeneration is seen on histologic examination of the
gastrocnemius muscle. There is no known treatment. No dogs
have been known to spontaneously recover, but affected dogs can
be acceptable pets.

Narcolepsy
 Narcolepsy is an inherited or acquired REM sleep disorder
(Table 16-1) that has been reported in many different breeds of
dogs, a few mixed-breed dogs, and one cat. In Doberman pinschers
and Labrador retrievers, this disorder is inherited as an autosomal
dominant trait with incomplete penetrance and the initial clinical
signs begin between 1 to 4 months of age. In other dogs, narcolepsy
can be acquired late in life as the result of brain inflammation,
sible for normal sleep. Primary signs of narcolepsy include excessive
daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, REM sleep at sleep onset, sleep
paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Behavioral and
polysomnography (PSG) studies indicate that dogs experience all
signs of narcolepsy.
347
V Cataplexy is an acute loss of muscle tone and is the most
 o  a s d  
V Attacks of cataplexy are usually initiated by something
exciting or pleasurable like food, play, greeting owners, or
sex, not by negative or painful stimuli. The severity of signs
varies from acute, episodic, brief periods of pelvic limb and neck
collapse to acute onset of REM sleep with flaccid (areflexia)
quadriplegia and twitching of eyelid and limb muscles. Affected
animals may be awakened from severe attacks and appear normal
between attacks but may sleep more during the day. The
diagnosis is usually based on the characteristic clinical signs.
V Drugs that may minimize or abolish cataplexy include oral
imiprimine (Tofranil, Novartis) O.5-2 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours
in dogs or cats, clomipramine (Clomacalm, Pfizer) 1-3 mg/kg
every 12 hours in dogs, fluoxetine (Prozac) 1 mg/kg every 24
hours in dogs and cats, buspirone (BuSpar) 2.5-10 mg in dogs or
cats every 8 to 12 hours, or selegiline hydrochloride (Anipryl,
Pfizer) O.5-1.0 mg/kg once daily in the morning in dogs.
Methylphenedate (Ritalin, Novartis) 0.25 mg/kg PO every 12 to
24 hours may be tried if excessive daytime sleepiness appears to
be a problem. Response to treatment varies. Congenital
narcolepsy in dogs stabilizes and does not worsen with age.
Rapid-Eye-Movement
Behavior Disorder
 During normal REM sleep (Table 16-1), the major muscle
groups are paralyzed so movement is minimal (Figure 16-1). If
the inhibitory system originating in the brainstem becomes non-
functional, significant motor activity can be released during
REM sleep and result in REM behavior disorder. This disorder
has been described in dogs and cats. Several golden retrievers
have been affected since puppyhood. Other dogs and cats seem
to develop the problem later in life
V During REM sleep, movements may be so violent that the
animal is propelled out of bed or across the floor. A few dogs
become aggressive and will growl, bite blankets, or briefly attack
but quickly awaken, and the aggression passes. However, as many
animals sleep in the same bed or room as their owners, the
disturbance may become difficult to bear. In addition, some
animals may urinate during these episodes, which makes them
even less tolerable.

Table 16-1
Basic Sleep Facts
● Phase I: The brain and muscles are relaxed.
● Phase Il: The brain is very active, but the major muscles of the body are
paralyzed so that only minor muscle twitching, paddling of the feet, and brief
mu scles can be observed to twitch during this period.
· Polysomnography (PsG): Recording of the electroencephalogram, elec-
during sleep; used to objectively determine the phase of sleep.
V REM behavior disorders can be differentiated from nocturnal
seizures by observation and PSG. With REM behavior disorder,
animals appear normal when aroused. Abnormal events may not
occur every time the animal is in REM sleep. Potassium bromide
(KBr) 22-44 mg/kg PO every 12 hours has been the most
effective treatment for controlling the signs in dogs. However,
improvement may not occur for 1 to 2 months after KBr therapy
is initiated. Oral gabapentin (Neurontin, Parke-Davis) 7.5-20
mg/kg in dogs or oral clonazepam (Klonopin, Roche) 0.01-0.1
mg/kg in dogs or cats given at bedtime may be tried but has been
less successful. Gabapentin and clonazepam should be initiated at
the lowest dose so daytime sedation does not occur. The dose can
be slowly increased until REM behavior is reduced or absent or
sedation occurs. In mild cases, many clients choose to confine
the pet to a small crate at night to avoid injury to the pet or
themselves or awakening of the household.
during REM sleep, violent movements often occur during REM behavior disorder.
