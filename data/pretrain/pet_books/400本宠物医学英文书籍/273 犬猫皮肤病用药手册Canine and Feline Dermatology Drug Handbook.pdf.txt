conditions of dogs and cats. wwhat makes this work different from other
available drug references is the inclusion of dermatological drugs not listed in
those other drug references, and the compilation of compounded medications
for ear diseases. In addition, we are providing detailed drug information
applicable to veterinary dermatology that includes indications and dosages for
drugs used for many dermatological diseases, and specific details on adverse
effects (e.g.. ototoxicity). Lastly. this work contains the unique addition of a
brief discussion of the common dermatological diseases of dogs and cats, with
an associated list of drugs that can be considered for their treatment.
The information contained in this book is derived from an extensive literature
search that included important veterinary peer-reviewed jourmals and textbooks.
and reliable online sources, in addition to the authors' clinical experience. The
book is divided into four sections encompassing systemic drugs, topical agents.
allergen-specific immunotherapy. and common demmatological diseases with a
list of drugs that can be used for their treatment. Both veterinary and human-
labeled drugs applicable to veterinary derrmatology are included. When available,
 manufacturers' recommended indications and dosages for veterinary-labeled
drugs are listed, but extra-label and anecdotal indications and dosages are also
mentioned when appropriate. Drug interactions reported are mostly extrapolated
from humans, as there is limited information available in dogs and cats, and we
hope this will bring awareness to veterinarians when using drug combinations.
We have included drugs available in the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom, and additionally some drugs not available in the United States that
 have been used by veterinarians in other countries.
We believe the information presented in this work valuably cormplerments

work is written primarily for general practice veterinarians, veteninary students,
veterinary dermatology residents and dermatologists, and overall, for everyone
passionate about veterinary dermatology. Vve believe it will be useful not only for
clinical practice, but also as a teaching tool for veterinary students and resident5.
We hope that this work will help vetennarians improve patient care by having
 broad information in a single dermatological drug reference.
As clinical experience and research in veterinary dermatological therapeutics
expand, and as new infommation becomes available, the authors welcome any
feedback from readers by e-mail (dermdrughandbook@wiley.com). including
clinical experience, adverse effects and drug interactions, omissions and errors,
to help us improve the quality of this book

Systemic Drugs
Acitretin
Trade/brand name: Soriatane? (US. CA). Neotigason? (UK), generic
13-cis-acitretin; etretin: isoetretin (Rx)
Classification: Synthetic retinoid (second-generation)
IN DICATIONS
Acitretin is indicated for several keratinization, follicular and sebaceous gland
abnormalities
Dogs: Primary or idiopathic seborrhea of cocker and springer spaniels, golden
retrievers, lnish setters and mixed-breed dogs, vitamin-A responsive dermatosis,
sebaceous adenitis, sebaceous gland hyperplasia and adenoma, solar dermatosis,
actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, infundibular keratinizing acanthoma
(.e., keratoacanthomas or intracutaneous cormifying epitheliomas), ichthyosis.
schnauzer cormedo syndrome, follicular dysplasias (e.g., color dilution alopecia),
inflarmmatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus, idiopathic nasodigital hyper-
keratosis, ear margin sebomhea/denmmatosis, epitheliotropic lyrmphoma. A recent
study showed a potential benefit of retinoic acids (particularly 9-cis retinoic acid
or alitretinoin at 2 mg/kg/day PO) for the treatment of canine pituitary-dependent
hyperadrenocorticism (Castillo et al. 2006): however, investigations have not
been performed with acitretin
Cats: Actinic keratosis, solar-induced squamous cell carcinoma, Bowenoid in-situ
carcinoma (multicentric squamous cell carcinoma in situ), sebaceous adenitis, acne.

MECHANISM OF ACTION
The exact mechanism of action of acitretin (active metabolite of etretinate) is
unknown. It is believed to alter gene expression through nuclear retinoic acid
receptors and bind to DNA to cause transcniption or transrepression changes in
protein synthesis leading to cellular differentiation and vaniable antiproliferative,
anti-inflammatory. and immunomodulatory effects.

Dogs: Herpes-virus-induced erythema multiforme.
Cats: Feline herpes virus 1 (FHv-1) ulcerative facial and nasal dermatitis and
stomatitis (herpetic dermatitis): FHv-1 rhinotracheitis associated with oral and
qutaneous ulcers; FHv-1 keratoconjunctivitis; herpes-virus-induced exfoliative
erythema multiforme.
 Note: FHV-1 has been shown to be resistant to acyclovir
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to acyclovir or other antivirals, dehydrated states, renal dysfunc-
tion, neurologic deficits. Use with caution in nursing patients.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Acyclovir is a synthetic purine analog (acyclic nucleoside analog) that inhibits
DNA replication of herpes virus.
DOSAGES
Doses are anecdotal and extrapolated from humans. Acyclovir appears to have
poor absorption in cats.
Dogs and cats
● 3-10mg/kg PO 5 times daily for 10 days
● 10-20mg/kg IV q8h (slow infusion for 1 hour)
● Feline FHV-1 infections: 10-25 mg/kg PO q12h or 200 mg per cat PO q4h

SIDE EFFECTS
There is limited experience in veterinary medicine; therefore, acyclovir should be
used with caution. Potential adverse effects with parenteral therapy include
thrombophlebitis, acute renal failure, and encephalopathologic changes (rare)
Gastrointestinal side effects may occur with either oral or parenteral therapy.
May be fetotoxic at high doses
Dogs
●Comrmon: vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy
●Rare: polyuria and polydipsia
Cats
● Common: vomiting. diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy
● Rare: leukopenia and anemia (likely reversible with discontinuation of therapy)
DRUG INTERACTIONS

Allopurinol
Trade/brand name: Zyioprim? (US. CA). Lopurine (US). Novo-Puro/? (CA)
Allopur? (UK). Zyloric (UK), generic (Rx)
Classification: Anti-inflammatory
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Allopurinol is often administered with pentavalent antimonial com-
pounds such as meglumine antimoniate or sodium stibogluconate to treat
leish m aniasis.
Cats: Use of allopurinol is not well investigated in cats. It may be used for
leishmaniasis.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to allopurinol. Caution in patients with impaired hepatic or renal
function. Caution in nursing dams as allopuninol can be excreted into milk.
Safety in breeding or pregnant animals has not been established
Section 1: Systemic Drugs
5
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Allopurinol is a purine analog that inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase with
consequent inhibition of uric acid synthesis and inhibition of formation of
superoxide anion radical. Allopurinol is metabolized by Leishmania organisms
into an inactive analog of inosine, which is incorporated into leishmanial RNA
causing faulty protein translation and inhibition of parasite multiplication
Allopurinol may also inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes.
DOSAGES
Dogs: Dosage schedules vary widely and the optimal dosage has not been
established. Dose adjustments are based on clinical signs. Administer 1 hour
after meals.
● Induction (with or without antirmony drugs): 15-30 mg/kg PO q12h for 1-8
months (until clinical remission is achieved)
● Maintenance: 15-20 mg/kg PO q24h for 1 week per month indefinitely
Note: Patients with renal insufficiency or hepatic dysfunction: reduce the dose
to 5 mg/kg PO q12h, increase interval of administration or avoid use
Cats: 20mg/kg PO q24h for up to 15 months

CONTRAINDICATIONS
Patients with known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines
Use cautiously in debilitated or geriatric animals, patients in corma or shock, with
CNS depression, namrow-angle glaucoma, and hepatic or renal impairment.
Caution in aggressive patients and working animals. Avoid in pregnant or lactat-
ing animals. It may be teratogenic. It should not be discontinued abruptly
Benzodiazepines have been reported to exacerbate myasthenia gravis in humans.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Alprazolam is a potent short-acting benzodiazepine exerting its maximum effect
-ozuag e 'amidazeiozuagolozen e s! nl Aesyads aon sinoy z on l uunm
azepine with a triazoie ring attached to its structure. Alprazolarm possesses anxi-
olytic, sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. It5
clinical effect may last longer and may have less effect on motor function and
liver at low doses compared to other benzodiazepines such as diazepam. Exact
mechanism of action is unknown. Postulated mechanisms include potentiation
of the effects of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, by binding to specific
benzodiazepine receptors, antagonism of serotonin, and diminished release or
turmover of acetylcholine in the CNS system.
DOSAGES
Alprazolam may be used in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, such as
clomipramine, for the management of more severe behavioral abnommalities
such as cases presenting acute panic attack5.
Dogs: 0.05-0.25 mg/kg PO q12-24h
Cats: 0.025-0.2 mg/kg PO q12-24h

DRUG INTERACTIONS
Antacids: may slow the rate, but not the extent of oral alprazolam absorption
This can be managed by separating the medications by 2 hours
ONS depressant drugs (e.g.. barbiturates, narcotics, anesthetics): may
increase alprazolam serum levels and additive effects may occur
Digoxin: alprazolam may increase senum levels of digoxin
Huoxetine: increase in alprazolam serum concentration
Hepatic metabolized drugs (e.g., amiodarone, cimetidine, chloramphenicol,
darithromycin, cyclosporine, diltiazem, erythromycin, isoniazid, ketocon-
azole, itraconazole): alprazolam metabolism may be reduced and excessive
sedation may occur
Omeprazole, propanolol, valproic acid: may decrease metabolism of benzo-
dazepines and cause excessive sedation
Rifampin: may induce hepatic microsomal enzyme activity and decrease
alprazolam's efficacy

Classification: Nutritional supplerment
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Superficial necrolytic dermatitis.
Cats: Cats with superficial necrolytic dermatitis might also benefit from amino
acid supplementation, as they have been reported to have hypoaminoacidemia;
 however, no information regarding products and dosages is available.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
 Dehydration, electrolyte irbalances, shock and inadequate oxygen supply
MECHANISM QF ACTION
A rmetabolic hepatopathy in which there is increased hepatic catabolism of amino
acids is hypothesized to explain the hypoaminoacidemia seen in superficial
necrolytic dermatitis. Thus, amino acid supplementation might replace the
deficiency of amino acids associated with this disease
DOSAGES
seems to be more successful when treatment is instituted early in the course of
the disease
Dogs
● Intravenous administration: 24mL/kg (or 500mg total volume per dog) IV slowly
over 8-12 hours in a large central vein (jugular) because the solution is hypertonic
and could cause phlebitis. After the initial therapy. the patient should be
re-examined in 7-10 days. If significant improvement is noted, then no further
infusions are needed. Prolonged remissions have been noted after only one infu
sion. If minimal to no response is noted, the infusions should be repeated every
7-10 days for four treatrments. If there is no improvement in 4-6 weeks, the
ouwe o puodsai peyn sbop ul suoisal uiys jo uoequaoex papienb si sisouboid
acid treatment is common. The timing of these exacerbations is highly variable
and armino acids should be re-administered with each exacerbation. Some dogs
may require monthly IV armino acid infusions, but many dogs can go several
months between infusions. As the disease progresses, the need for infusions will
likely increase. Altermatively, the treatrment could be performed 3 days in a row or
Note: The use of parenteral amino acids solutions should be undertaken with
specific training and intensive care monitoring.
● Oral administration: oral protein supplements can be given either in conjunction
with or instead of IV amino acid infusion; however, the IV amino acid infusion
appears to be the most effective. There are different supplement options avail-

INDICATIONS
Management of behavior disorders, neuropathic pain, and psychogenic and allergic
dermatoses
Dogs: Tail biting. flank sucking. anal licking. acral lick dermatitis, neuropathic
pain and pruritus, allergic skin diseases. Despite the widespread use of antihista-
mines to treat canine atopic dermatitis, currently there is no conclusive evidence
of efficacy of oral type 1 antihistamines for treatment of chronic and acute flares
of canine atopic dermatitis (Olivry et al. 2010)

dogs and cats, as with other antihistamines, is individualized and unpredictable
Antihistarmines should be given as preventative therapy. on a daily basis, to keep
the histamine receptors blocked before histamine is released.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants. Should not be used with monoamine
oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Caution in patients with seizures, thyroid disorders
hepatic, renal, or cardiac disorders, xerostomia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma,
diabetes, adrenal tumors, pregnant or lactating animals. Amitriptyline will interfere
with the intradermal test reactivity. Drug withdrawal is usually recommended for
at least 2 weeks prior to allergy testing.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Amitriptyline increases neurotransmitter levels of serotonin and norepinephrine by
inhibiting their uptake at presynaptic nerve terminals, and it is also a variable
competitive antagonist at acetylcholine (muscarinic) and alpha-1 and alpha-2-
adrenergic receptors. It also has substantial antihistamine properties by blocking
H, receptors.
DOSAGES
 Dosage schedules vary widely, and the optirmal dosage has not been established.
Inter-individual variability in response is to be expected; therefore, dosage should
be adjusted based on response. Usually a 2- to 4-week trial is recommended,
as it may take several weeks before efficacy is noted. After long-term use,
discontinuation of the drug should be gradual (over 1-3 weeks)

● Transdermal use: amitriptyline has been found to have minimal absorption
after a single transderrmal dose in cats at 5mg per cat (rnuch lower bio-
availability than oral); therefore, until supporting pharmacokinetic data
are available, veterinarians should not rely on the transdermal route for

 Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
Note: Ideally. bacterial culture and sensitivity should be performed prior to
beginning therapy.
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Caution in animals allergic to penicillins or cephalosporins. Safety in pregnant or
breeding animals has not been determined
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Amoxicillin is bactenicidal in action and acts through the inhibition of biosynthesis
of cell wall mucopeptide of susceptible organisms. The action of clavulanic
acid extends the antimicrobial spectrum of armoxicillin to include organisms
resistant to armoxicillin and other beta-lactarm antibiotics. It may also posses5
anti-inflammatory effects, as it was shown to decrease transmigration of
leukocytes through endothelial cell monolayers.

CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Hypersensitivity to amphotericin B or its drug class. Caution in animals with
impaired renal or hepatic function. Do not use in animals with electrolyte
irmbalances or dehydration. Use is not advised in pregnant animals although
there is no reported toxicity.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Amphotericin B is usually fungistatic but it can be fungicidal against some
organisms. depending on drug concentration. It binds to sterols (primarily
ergosterol) in the fungal cell membrane and alters the permeability. allowing
leakage of intracellular components. Amphotericin B also has immunomodula-
tory properties by activating macrophages and potentiating their phagocytic,
tumoricidal and microbicidal actions due to induced production of IL-1 and
TNF-alpha
DOSAGES
Nephrotoxicity is the dose-limiting factor; may have to interrupt therapy. reduce
dosage, or use altermative drugs. Drug needs to be administered intravenously

Auranofin
Trade/brand name: Ridaura? (US. CA) (Rx)
Classification: Immunomodulatory (immunosuppressive, Gold salt)
INDICATIONS
There is limited experience in dogs and cats. Gold salts should be saved for cases
that are unresponsive to or do not tolerate more conventional therapy, such as
gucocorticoids and azathioprine. Auranofin appears to be less toxic but less
efficacious than injectable gold. Response to treatment is variable
Dogs: lmmune-mediated skin diseases such as pemphigus complex
Cats: lmmune-mediated skin diseases such as pemphigus complex, eosinophilic
granuloma complex, and plasma cell pododermatitis and stomatitis.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in animals with suppressed bone marrow or animals receiving other
bone rmarrow suppressive agents such as azathioprine and cyclophospharmide.
It is contraindicated in severely debilitated animals, animals with uncontrolled
diabetes, and pregnant animals, and in systemic lupus erythermatosus (may
exacerbate the disease).
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The exact mechanism of action of gold salts is unknown, but auranofin was
shown to have anti-inflarmmatory, inmmunomodulating. and antimicrobial in-vitro
effects. Gold salts inhibit macrophage phagocytosis, reduce the release of inflam-
matory mediators, such as lysosomal enzymes, histamine and prostaglandin,
inactivate complerment components, interfere with imrmunoglobulin-synthesizing

Azathioprine
Trade/brand name: imuran? (US. CA, UK). Azasan? (US) (Rx)
Classification: Immunomodulatory (imrmunosuppressive)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Various immune-mediated skin diseases including permphigus complex
blistering skin diseases (e.g. epidemmolysis bullosa acquisita, bullous pemphig-
oid, mucous membrane pemphigoid), discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic
upus erythematosus, vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus, exfoliative cuta-

ile pyogranulomatous disorders, familial demmatomyositis, uveodermatologic
syndrome, penianal fistula, symmetrical lupoid onychodystrophy. cryoglobuline-
mia, cryofibninogenemia, graft-versus-host disease, and reactive histiocytosis
Note: Azathioprine can be used as a glucocorticoid sparing agent, in combina-
tion with glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive agents in more refractory
cases, or as a sole therapy.
Cats: Even though effective in cats, azathioprine is generally contraindicated
because of its potential severe side effects
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to azathioprine or its drug class. Contraindicated in cats because
of difficulty in accurately dosing and potential for profound myelosuppression
and fatal toxicity. Caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Avoid use in
 pregnant animals.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent that antagonizes purine meta-
bolism, thereby inhibiting RNA and DNA synthesis and mitosis. Azathioprine
inhibits T-cell-mediated irmmune function, decreases T-cell-dependent antibody
synthesis, and decreases the number of Langerhans cells and antigen-presenting

hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransterase
DOSAGES
Dogs: 1.5-2.5mg/kg PO q24h until rermission, then dosage can be reduced to q48h.
Long-term management may be possible with doses as low as 0.5-2 mg/kg q72h
Note: Clinical response may require 4-8 weeks. It may be combined with othen

SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs: Most of the side effects are reversible with eainly discontinuation of the drug
Susceptibility to adverse effects may be due to a metabolism deficiency of thiopu-
nne methyltransferase, reported in 1o% of the dogs. There might be vaniations in
the activity of this enzyme between dog breeds, with giant schnauzers having much
lower enzyme activity (potentially more susceptible to azathiopnine side effects) and
Alaskan malamutes having much higher enzyme activity (perhaps needing higher
dosages of azathioprine). There are also anecdotal reports that generics have a
higher incidence of hepatic toxic reactions, but the authors have not observed this
problem in practice. In general, dosage adjustments can be made based on the
lesults of laboratory monitoring and clinical improvement

CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to azithromycin or its drug class. Caution in patients with history
of vomiting or hepatic function and/or biliary dysfunction, and in animals with
arrhythmias
Section 1:SystemicDrugs
21
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Azithromycin inhibits bacterial RNA-dependent protein synthesis by penetrating
the cell wall and binding to the 5oS ribosomal subunit. Although usually classified
as bacteriostatic, it may be bactericidal at higher concentrations against selected
organisms. It is unclear if azithromycin and other macrolide antimicrobials modulate
the host immune response or if they eliminate latent pathogens that could
possibly trigger chronic inflammation; however, they have been shown to
 modulate in-vitro neutrophil oxidant production, and pro-inflarmmatory cytokine
currently unknown. It is speculated that azithromycin may kill oral bacteria,
decreasing gingival stimulation and reducing cyclosporine-induced gingival
overgrowth by suppressing protein synthesis and concentrating in phagocytes
and fibroblasts. Despite potential indication for canine papillomatosis, it is
aurrently unknown if azithromycin has an antiviral effect

DRUG INTERACTIONS
 Azithromycin, unlike erythromycin, does not inhibit hepatic rmicrosomal enzyme
CYP3A4 (formerly cytochrome P450 llA4). thereby reducing the potential for
drug interactions.

Classification: Vitamin (vitamin D analog)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Primary idiopathic seborrhea (especially in spaniel breeds).
Note: Calcitriol is not cormronly used by the authors as a first-line therapy
for idiopathic or primary seborrhea in dogs, but it can be used as an alternative
therapy for more severe and refractory case5.
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Patients with hypercalcemia, vitamin D toxicity, malabsorption syndrome, and hyper-
phosphatemia. Safety in pregnant and lactating animals has not been established.
MECHANISM OF ACTIGN
Calcitriol, or 1.,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, a vitarmin D metabolite, is a hormone
that regulates serum calcium levels by stimulating calcium mobilization from
bones, by increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium, and by reducing
its renal excretion. Vitamin D analogs inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, induce
 keratinocyte terminal differentiation, and decrease immunologic reactivity by
reducing the production or transcription of various cytokines and reducing
the antigen-presenting function of Langerhans cells. It has been shown to
significantly decrease cell proliferation, as measured by cell labeling indices.

Trade/brand name: Zyrtec? (US). Zirtec? (UK), generic
Classification: Antihistamine (second-generation)
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Histamine-rmediated pruritic and allergic skin conditions includ-
ing urticaria and insect-bite hypersensitivity. Despite the widespread use of anti-
histarines to treat canine atopic dermatitis, currently there is no conclusive
evidence of efficacy of oral type 1 antihistarmines for treatment of chronic and
acute flares of canine atopic dermatitis (Olivry et al. 2010).
Note: The response to cetirizine in dogs and cats, as with other antihistamines.
i individualized and unpredictable. Antihistamines should be given as preventa-
tive therapy. on a daily basis, to keep the histamine receptors blocked before
histamine is released.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in animals hypersensitive to cetirizine or hydroxyzine. Dosage adjust-
ment is recommended in humans with severe renal or hepatic impairment, and
in elderly people. The formulation containing pseudoephedrine should not be
used in dogs and cats. Caution in patients with hepatic disease, pregnant and
lactating anirmals. Cetirizine may interfere with the intradermal test reactivity.
Drug withdrawal is usually recormmended for at least 2 weeks prior to allergy
testing.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
 Cetirizine is a piperazine derivative and carboxylated metabolite of hydroxyzine
with selective histamine H,-receptor antagonism and anti-allergic properties
nhibiting histamine-induced wheal and flare responses. In addition, it inhibits
eosinophil, T-lymphocyte, and monocyte chermotaxis during the late phase of
the allergic response and decreases intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1
expression on epithelial cells. It possesses minimal anticholinergic or antiserotonergic
effects.
DOSAGES
There is limited experience in dogs and cats
Dogs: 1 mg/kg or 10-20mg per dog P0 q12-24h
Cats: 1 mg/kg or 5mg per cat Po q12-24l

DRUG INTERACTIONS
Compared to some other antihistamines, cetirizine has low potential for interaction
with drugs metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.
CNS depressants: benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam), other antihistamines
that cause sedation (e.g., diphenhydramine), anti-seizure drugs (e.g..
carbamazepine), sedatives, muscle relaxants, narcotic pain relievers

INDICATIGNS
Dogs and cats: Histamine-mediated pruritic and allergic skin conditions including

mines to treat canine atopic dermatitis, currently there is no conclusive evidence
of efficacy of oral type 1 antihistamines for the treatment of chronic and acute
flares of canine atopic dermatitis (Olivry et af. 2010)
Note: The response to chlorpheniramine in dogs and cats, as with other
antihistamines, is individualized and unpredictable. A better result may be
achieved with the combination of chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine than
with chlorpheniramine used as sole therapy. since this treatment modality has
been reported to be efficacious in ameliorating the clinical signs of canine atopic
dermatitis (Olivry et ar. 2o1o). Antihistamines should be given as preventative
therapy. on a daily basis, to keep the histamine receptors blocked before histamine
is released. It is one of the most common antihistamines used in cats for control
of pruritic conditions. May also be used as adjunctive therapy for mast cell tumors.

Classification: Antibacterial (second-generation fluoroquinolone)
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Skin and soft tissue infections including superficial and deep
pyodermas caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus
(including S. pseucintemmedius, penicillinase-producing, and methicillin-resistant
strains) and Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsielia
Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Campyiobacter, Shigella, Saimonella, Aeromonas,
Haemophius, Proteus, Yersinia, Serratia, and Vibrio. Other susceptible organisms
include Brucella, Chiamycia trachomatis, Mycoplasma, and Mycobacterium. Most
anaerobes and some Streptococcus are resistant. May be used for treatment of
infections of the ear canal, particularly otitis media, caused by susceptible
organisrms; however, tissue concentration is not known for the external or middle
ear and this indication is controversial because of unpredictable efficacy.
Note: Ideally. bacterial culture and sensitivity should be performed prior to
beginning therapy.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
 Do not use in animals hypersensitive to ciprofloxacin. Because of potential
damage to articular cartilage in skeletally immature dogs, ciprofloxacin should not
be used in small and mediur-breed dogs between 2 and 8 months of age, large-
breed dogs until 12 months of age, and giant-breed dogs until 18 months of age
Avoid high concentrations in patients with renal failure, because of potential CNS
toxicity. Also avoid use in pregnant, lactating. or breeding animals. Caution in
patients prone to seizures because of possible CNS stimulation and dehydrated
animals because of possible crystalluria. Despite low risk of retinal toxicity in cats
receiving ciprofloxacin, high doses in cats should be used with caution. Minimize
or avoid sun exposure, as photosensitivity is reported in humans.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal agent that inhibits bacterial DNA
gyrase, thereby preventing bacterial DNA synthesis. Interestingly. ciprofloxacin
was shown in vitro to modulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis in neoplastic
cells; however, the clinical application as a chermotherapeutic agent in dogs and
cats is unknown.

mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium leprae. M. tubercurosis. M. avium
complex (MAC), M. bovis, and M. chelonei
Note: Ideally. bacterial culture and sensitivity should be performed prior to
beginning therapy.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment or pre-existing gastrointes-
tinal conditions such as diarrhea or abdominal pain. Its safety in pregnant animals
has not been evaluated.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Clofazimine is a bactericidal agent that binds to mmycobactenial DNA and inhibits
growth. It also has anti-inflarmmatory and immunosuppressive effects, but the mech-
anism of action is not well understood. It may also have anti-leishmanial activity

CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Do not use in animals allergic to tricyclic antidepressants. It should not be
used in breeding male dogs. Caution in patients with decreased gastro-
intestinal motility. urinary or stool retention, cardiac rhythm disturbances,
gaucoma, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, pre-existing seizure disorders, and liver
impairment. Caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or those that are receiving
thyroid supplementation. because of increased risk of cardiac rhythm
abnormalities. Avoid use in patients with diabetes mellitus, as clomiprarine may
alter glucose blood levels. Clomipramine may interfere with the intradermal test
leactivity. Drug withdrawal is usually recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to
allergy testing.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Clomipramine selectively inhibits serotonin (5-HT) reuptake, and its metabolite)
dirmethylclomipramine, blocks norepinephrine reuptake at the presynaptic neu-
Ion terminals; thereby it increases serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations
at the synapse sites. Clomipramine also has moderate antihistaminic and
anticholinergic activities and is an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist
DOSAGES
Dogs
● Label dose: 2-4 mg/kg PO q24h or divided q12h
+ Psychogenic dermatoses: 1-3 mg/kg PO q12h for at least 4 weeks
Cats
● General dose: 0.25-1 mng/kg PO q12-24h
● Hyperesthesia syndrome: 0.5-1 mg/kg PO q24h
● Psychogenic alopecia: clomipramine administered at 0.5mg/kg PO q24h for
56 days failed to demonstrate significant improvement in psychogenic alope-
cia; therefore, higher doses (1 mg/kg PO q12-24h) and longer duration of
treatment may be needed for treatment of psychogenic alopecia (Mertens
et al. 2006)
Note: Clomipramine is often used in combination with other behavior-modifica-
a laag ioy iuawabeuew joeyag yiim pauigwo ag Aew i sbnp uon
cacy. Clomipramine may be given with food to minimize vomiting. It may
take 4-6 weeks to see improvement. Clomipramine dose should be started low
and increased gradually every 2 weeks to determine the lowest effective dose
and minimize side effects. Treatment can be maintained for 4-6 months, if clini-
cal signs are well controlled, before gradually reducing the dose (reduce by
25% every 1-2 weeks). Abrupt cessation should be avoided to prevent
rebound effects. Continue the weaning process until the animal is either com-
pletely off the drug or until the abnormal behavior reoccurs. At this point,
return to the previously effective dose and continue for a longer period before
 trying to wean again.

SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs
● Common: anorexia, vomiting. diamhea, lethargy. elevation of liver enzymes,
and anticholinergic effects (e.g.. dry mouth, polydipsia, tachycardia, urine
retention, reduced intestinal motility). Clomipramine may decrease total T4
and free T4 levels in dogs: therefore, thyroid tests should be interpreted with
roidism (Gulikers et al. 2003)
● Rare: aggression, lowered seizure threshold and cardiac effects are possible,
although clomipramine was shown not to cause any concerning cardiac
abnormalities in healthy dogs
Cats
● Common: lethargy. constipation, mydriasis, and anticholinergic effects
motility)
●Rare: anorexia, vomiting. diarrhea, weight gain, disorientation, hypotherrmia
Note: Cats have been reported to be more susceptible to the adverse effects of
clomipramine than dogs. Overdoses can produce life-threatening arrhythmias,
seizures, and cardiorespiratory collapse.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) and CNS depressants (e.g., other
tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, general anes-
thetics): additive effects
Antithyroid agents: potential risk of agranulocytosis
Cimetidine: inhibition of clomipramine metabolism and increased toxicity
risk
Clonidine: potential for increase in blood pressure
Meperidine, pentazocine, dextromethorphan, and serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRls) (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine): increase risk for serotonin
syndrome
Monoamine oxidase (MAo) inhibitors (e.g., selegiline or amitraz): should
not be used concomitanty or within 14 days before or after clomipramine
Phenobarbital: increases levels of phenobarbital
Rifampin: potential for decrease in clornipramine levels
Sympathomimetic agents: increase risk of cardiac effects

marked muscle weakness, and hepatic or renal irmpairrment. Caution in aggres-
sive patients and working animals. Avoid in pregnant or lactating animal5.
It may be teratogenic. Clonazepam should not be discontinued abruptly.
Benzodiazepines have been reported to exacerbate myasthenia gravis in
humans.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Clonazepam possesses sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, muscle-relaxant, and
anxiolytic properties. Exact mechanism of action is unknown. Postulated mecha-
nisms include: potentiation of the effects of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
by binding to specific benzodiazepine receptors; antagonism of serotonin; and
dirminished release or turmover of acetylcholine in the CNS systerm.

MECHANISM OF ACTION
Colchicine is best known for its antigout activity in humans; however, its precise
mode of action has not been detemmined. It is an alkaloid that binds to microtu-
bular proteins and alters a variety of basic cellular functions such as mitosis
dhemotaxis and cell adhesion. It inhibits the following: secretion of immunoglob-
uins, mononuclear cells and neutrophil migration, lysosomal degranulation, IL-1
production, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression, histamine release,
synthesis of collagen by stimulating the activity of collagenases. Moreover, colchi-
cine appears to alter neuromuscular function and to block the synthesis and
secretion of serum amyloid A by hepatocytes, thereby preventing amyloid
formation and deposition. It has also been shown to inhibit the expression of
eukocyte vascular endothelial growth factor in dogs
DOSAGES

missible venereal tumors, and mast cell tumors. Also used as a rescue drug for
 efractory cases of imrmune-mediated diseases including permphigus complex,
 cutaneous vasculitis, systermic lupus erythematosus, and bullous pemphigoid
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Cyclophosphamide should not be used in patients hypersensitive to the drug. Do
not use in pregnant animals (teratogenic and embryotoxic). Caution in patients
exposed drug represents a greater biosafety hazard than the cut surface
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard derivative and a non-specific cell-cycle
inhibitor. Its metabolites (phosphoramide mustard and acrolein) act as alkylating
agents interfering with DNA synthesis and function. Cyclophospharmide has
potent immunosuppressive activity. impairing both humoral and cell-mediated
immune systerms.

CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Patients hypersensitive to cyclosporine. Patients with malignant neoplasia.
Caution in patients with pre-existing infections, diabetes mellitus, or hepatic or
renal disease, and in pregnant animals. Avoid use in reproducing animals. Avoid
use of live modified or attenuated vaccines during treatment or within a Z-week
nterval before or after treatment, as the effect of cyclosporine on the immune
response to modified live vaccines is unknown (killed vaccines should be used

less than 4 Ib (1.8kg) body weight. One study showed that administration of oral
cyclosporine at 5 mg/kg/day for 30 days did not interfere with intradermal test
results; however, drug withdrawal may be recommended for at least 4 week5
prior to intradermal testing if cyclosporine has been administered for longer than
30 days (Goldman et ar. 2010). The effect of cyclosporine on allergy serum test
lesults has not been investigated; therefore, at least 4 weeks withdrawal period
may be recommended prior to testing.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Cyclosporine binds to a specific cellular receptor on calcineurin and inhibits the
aun buynoig aiojaiau remued uononpsuen peubis paeare-oidaal liii
gene transcription of T-cell cytokines, especially Il-2, which is essential for T-cell 
proliferation. This inhibition makes cyclosporine a potent inhibitor of cell-mediated
immunity and a lesser inhibitor of humoral immunity. It selectively depresses the
induction and proliferation of cytotoxic T cells, antibody production by helper-T-
cell-dependent B cells, the proliferation of activated T cells, and the activation of
mononuclear phagocytes and helper T cells. Cyclosporine has also shown to
have a wide variety of anti-inflammatory effects on leukocytes other than
lymphocytes, and on other types of cells, including mast cells, eosinophils.
Langerhans cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes. It has also been documented
to have a cytostatic effect on epidermal keratinocytes.
DOSAGE
Cyclosporine appears to be most consistenty absorbed when given without
food (at least 2 hours before and after a meal); however, one study showed that
administration of cyclosporine with food does not interfere with clinical response
(Thelen et al. 2006). In addition, administration with food may reduce gastroin-
testinal side effects.

mixing four 100 mg capsules of cyclosporine (400 mg total) in 100 mL of baby
oil and thoroughly applying the mixture to the skin and hair coat. After 1 hour
shampoo the dog with a degreasing product (e.g. benzoyl-peroxide-based

● Cutaneous discoid lupus erythematosus: 30mg/kg Po q24h was used in one
dog and good response was noted after 6 weeks of therapy: however, the
medication was discontinued after 24 weeks as the dog developed severe
gingival hyperplasia and a proliferative lymphoplasmatoid dermatitis (Rosenkrantz

Note: A recent prospective study showed that administration of oral cyclosporine
at a median dose of 5.2 mg/kg/day (range: 4.4-6.9 mg/kg/day) provides comparable
efficacy relative to chlorambucil for the managerment of feline pemphigus folia-
ceus, while providing superior glucocorticoid-sparing effect (lrwin et af. 201 1).
Maintenance therapy: Once significant clinical response is seen, the dose may
be tapered by decreasing cyclosporine daily dose to 5o% of the initial dose, or
by decreasing the frequency of dosing to every other day followed by dosing

maintenance is reached. Tapering the dose by decreasing the frequency of
administration or reducing daily dosage appears to yield similar responses.
During the tapering phase, relapses of clinical signs may occur. Ketoconazole
dose is maintained, but the frequency should be reduced along with cyclo-
sporine.

fluconazole), bromocriptine, chloroquine, cimetidine, cisapride, corticoster-
oids, danazol, grapefruit juice/powder, losartan, valsartan, macrolide
antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin), metoclopramide, omepra-
zole, sertraline: increase cyclosporine serum levels, with potential risk of
cyclosponine toxicity
Calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, ditiazem): increase severity of
gingival hyperplasia and increase cyclosporine serum levels, with potential risk
of toxicity
Carbamazepine, nafcillin, octreotide,phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin,
sulfadimidine, triclopidine, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, St. John's
wort: decrease cyclosporine serum levels, with potential reduction in efficacy
Digoxin: increases digoxin serum levels, with potential toxicity
Ketoconazole and other similar antifungals: substantial reduction in
cyclosporine metabolism in dogs and cats allows use of this interaction to
reduce cyclosporine dose and result in cost reduction of treatrment. Monitoring
of cyclosporine serum levels may be required
Macrocycliclactones (e.g., ivermectin, milbemycin) orother P-glycoprotein
substrates: decreased efflux of these drugs from blood-brain barrier cells and
potential risk of CNS toxicity
Methotrexate: potential increase in methotrexate serum levels
Nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., acyclovir, cimetidine, diclofenac, ranitidine.
amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, colchicine, erythromycin, vancomycin,
trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, NSAIDs): possible additive nephrotoxicity

Spironolactone and other potassium-sparing diuretics: increase risk of
hyperkalemia
Vaccinations: decrease vaccine effectiveness; avoid use of live attenuated vaccines
MONITORING
● Efficacy and adverse effects
● Therapeutic drug monitoring (particularly when response is poor or adverse
effects occur): a trough sample is usually recommended at either 12 or 24 hours
after the last dose; however, a 2-hour blood sample value might correlate better
with clinical results than a trough sample. In cats, levels are twice as high at 2
hours as at 12 hours. The most adequate and safest therapeutic range has not
been determined in dogs and cats. It is speculated that an adequate level
should be within 200-400ng/mL for anti-inflammatory doses, and within
100-500ng/mL and 250-1000 ng/mL for immunosuppressive doses in dogs
and cats, respectively. Different methodologies rmay lead to different results.
The therapeutic level should be measured at least 2 weeks after initiation of
 therapy, as cyclosporine levels tend to be more stable at that tirme.
● Chemistry profile, urinalysis and urine culture. The authors perform these tests
at baseline and every 6-12 months during treatment, in addition to CBC at
baseline and every 12 months
Cyproheptadine Hydrochloride
Trade/brand name: Periactin? (US, CA, UK), generic (Rx)
Classification: Antihistamine (first-generation)
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Histamine-mediated pruritic and allergic skin conditions including
urticaria and insect-bite hypersensitivity. Despite the widespread use of antihista-
mines to treat canine atopic demmatitis, currently there is no conclusive evidence of
efficacy of oral type 1 antihistamines for treatment of chronic and acute flares of
Ganine atopic dermatitis (Olivry et ar. 2010)
Note: The response to cyproheptadine in dogs and cats, as with other antihista-
mines, is individualized and unpredictable. Antihistamines should be given as
preventative therapy, on a daily basis, to keep the histarmine receptors blocked
before histamine is released
CONTRAINDICATIONS

thyroidism, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, glaucoma, prostatic hypertro-
phy. pyeloduodenal, or bladder neck obstruction. Cyproheptadine will interfere
with the intradermal test reactivity. Drug withdrawal is usually recormrmended for at
least 2 weeks prior to allergy testing
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Cyproheptadine is a histamine H,-receptor antagonist with anti-allergic properties
inhibiting histamine-induced wheal and flare responses. It also has anticholinergic,
antiserotonergic, and calcium channel blocking actions

CONTRAINDICATIONS
Avoid use in cats, because of increased incidences of neurotoxicity and hemolytic
anemia. Do not use in animals allergic to dapsone or other sulfone drugs or
sulfonamides. It should not be used in patients with blood dyscrasias such
25 anemia. Caution in patients with hepatic disease (may need to reduce dose)
ts safety in pregnant animals has not been evaluated.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Dapsone or diaminodiphenylsulfone is a sulfone with bacteriostatic and
bactericidal activities. It has sirilar actions to that of sulfonarmides, affecting
primarily folic acid synthesis in susceptible organisms. Dapsone also has
anti-inflammatory properties by decreasing neutrophil chermotaxis, complerment
activation, antibody production, and lysosomal enzyme synthesis.
DOSAGES
Dogs: Rarely. dogs may become resistant to dapsone. The combination of
dapsone with other drugs, such as glucocorticoids, may be synergistic, and it is
often used as adjunctive therapy to treat non-infectious disorders. Clinical
response may require 4-6 week5.

INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Altermative anti-inflammatory therapy for allergic diseases such
as atopic demmatitis, and immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune diseases
such as pemphigus complex (particularly in cases that do not respond to or
do not tolerate the conventional prednisone/prednisolone therapy). Also used
to diagnose (low-dose dexamethasone suppression test) or localize (low-dose or
high-dose dexamethasone suppression test) spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in pregnant animals. Systemic glucocorticoids are generally contrain-
dicated in patients with renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and infectious diseases.
Avoid long-temn daily or every-other-day use. Use dexarmethasone cautiously in
cats with any cardiovascular disorders that alter the cormpensatory rmechanisms
for increased plasma volume to avoid congestive heart failure (Ployngam et ar.
2006). Dexarmethasone, a5 any other glucocorticoid, should be discontinued
slowly in animals receiving chronic therapy. Dexarmethasone will interfere with
intradermal and allergy serum test reactivity; therefore, drug withdrawal is usually
recommended for at least 4 weeks prior to allergy testing for oral administration
Section 1: Systemic Drugs  65
and 8 weeks for injectable administration. Injectable dexamethasone is considered
unsuitable for management of chronic dermatologic diseases due to potential
severe effect on the H PA-axis.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The mechanism of action of glucocorticoids is very complex, but basically they alter
the transcription of DNA, leading to alterations in cellular metabolism, thereby cau5-
 ing inhibition of inflarmrmatory cells and suppression of rmany inflarnrmatory rmediators

Dicloxacillin Sodium
Trade/brand name: Dynapen? (US), generic (Rx)
Classification: Antibacterial (beta-lactam)
IN DICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Skin and soft tissue infections including superficial and deep
pyodermas, wounds and abscesses caused by susceptible Grarm-positive bac-
teria, particularly Staphyfococcus. Not effective against methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus strains, mycobacteria, fungi. mycoplasma, rickettsia, and
virus. Because there are no clinical efficacy studies available, and because
other drugs are available to treat staphylococcus skin infections in dogs and
cats, dicloxacillin is not commonly used. Moreover, in dogs oral absorption
is low and may not be suitable for therapy.
Note: Ideally. bacterial culture and sensitivity should be performed prior to
beginning therapy.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in animals hypersensitive to penicillins. Caution in patients with
documented hypersensitivity to other beta-lactarm antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporins,
carbapenems, cefamycins). Avoid use in pregnant or lactating animals as its
safety has not been determined
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Like cloxacillin and oxacillin, dicloxacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits
bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin binding proteins, leading to
cell lysis and death of the organism
DOSAGES
 Absorption in dogs is better on an ermpty stomach
Dogs and cats:20-30mg/kg PO q8h
Duration of treatment: 1-2 weeks past resolution of clinical signs.

Classification: Antibacterial (third-generation fluoroquinolone)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Skin and soft tissue infections including superficial and deep pyodermas.
wounds and abscesses caused by susceptible Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacilli and cocci, including most species and strains of Klebsieffa, Staphyiococcus,
Escherichia coli,Enterobacter, Campyiobacter,Shigella,Proteus,and Pasteurela
Some strains of Pseuofomonas aeruginosa, and most Enterococcus, are resistant.
Like other fluoroquinolones, difloxacin has weak activity against most anaerobes
and is not a good choice when treating known or suspected anaerobic infection5.
Cats: No information available
Note: The authors do not recommend the use of fluoroquinolones as first-line
therapy for pyoderma. Fluoroquinolones should be considered primarily for
chronic deep pyodermas associated with extensive scar tissue, because of their
excellent tissue penetration. Antibiotic selection, however, should be based on
culture and susceptibility results
Section 1: Systemic Drugs   71
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Contraindicated in dogs known to be hypersensitive to difloxacin or other fluoro-
quinolones and in immature, growing animals, because of potential arthropathies
(during the rapid growth phase between 2-8 months in small and medium-sized
breeds and up to 18 months in large and giant breeds). Caution in animals with
known or suspected CNS disorders (e.g., seizure disorders), because of potential

MECHANISM OF ACTION
Difloxacin is a concentration-dependent bactericidal agent that inhibits bacterial
DNA gyrase enzyme (a type ll topoisomerase), preventing bacterial DNA synthesis
and consequently bactenial replication.
DOSAGES
Dogs: 5-10mg/kg PO q24h
Duration of treatment: Manufacturer recommendstreating for 2-3 days beyond

Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride
Trade/brand name: Benadny/? (US. CA). Benadryi Allergy? (US. CA).
Dreemon? (UK). Medinex? (UK). Myto/? (UK). many different brands and
genenics available
Classification: Antihistarmine (first-generation)
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Histamine-mediated pruritic and allergic conditions including
urticaria, angioedema, and insect-bite hypersensitivity. Despite the widespread
use of antihistamines to treat canine atopic derm atitis, currently there is no
conclusive evidence of efficacy of oral type 1 antihistamines for treatment of
chronic and acute flares of canine atopic dermatitis (Olivry et al. 2010). It may
also be used as adjunctive therapy for mast cell turmors.
Note: It is one of the most common antihistamines used in dogs for control
of pruritic conditions. The response to diphenhydramine in dogs and cats, as
with other antihistamines, is individualized and unpredictable. Antihistamines
should be given as preventative therapy. on a daily basis, to keep the histarnine
 receptors blocked before histamine is released.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
 Do not use in anirnals allergic to diphenhydrarnine. Caution in patients with
hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease. hypertension, glaucoma, prostatic
hypertrophy, pyeloduodenal or bladder neck obstruction. Caution in patients
with hepatic disease, and in pregnant and lactating anirmals. Diphenhydrarnine
will interfere with the intradermal test reactivity. Drug withdrawal is usually
 recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to allergy testing.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Diphenhydramine is a histamine H,-receptor antagonist with anti-allergic prop-
erties inhibiting histamine-induced wheal and flare responses. It has substantial
anticholinergic and sedative effects

but as an altermative for dogs and cats that cannot tolerate ivermectin, except
for ivermectin-sensitive canine breeds, where doramectin should be avoided
Ideally. client informed consent should be obtained prior to initiation of
treatment, as the treatment of these conditions with doramectin is extra-label.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
The manufacturer recommends not using doramectin in animal species other
than cattle and swine, because of potential severe adverse reactions. Use in
dogs and cats is extra-label. Canine breeds susceptible to ABCB1-1 (MDR1) allele
mutation such as collies, Border collies, Shetland sheepdogs, Australian shep-
herds, long-haired whippets, old English sheepdog. German shepherds (espe-
cially white German shepherds), silken windhound, McNab and herding-breed
crosses should not receive doramectin, because of potential high risk of toxicity.
Susceptible breeds should be tested for the mutant ABCB1-1 (MDR1) gene prior
to considering treatment with systemic avermectin drugs. Do not use without
up-to-date negative heartworm test, or in patients with heartworm disease
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Doramectin, similar to other macrocyclic lactones, is neurotoxic to parasites by
increasing membrane permeability to chlonde ions and potentiating the effects of
the inhibitory neurotransrnitter GABA, leading to paralysis and death of the parasite
DOSAGES

Note: The response to doxepin in dogs and cats, as with other antihistamines, is
individualized and unpredictable. Antihistamines should be given as preventative
therapy. on a daily basis, to keep the histamine receptors blocked before hista-
mine is released.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
 Hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants. Should not be used with monoarmine
oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Caution in patients with urinary retention or glau-
coma, or in epileptic patients, as it may lower seizure threshold. Doxepin may
interfere with the intrademmal test reactivity. Drug withdrawal is usually recom-
 mended for at least 2 weeks prior to allergy testing.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Doxepin increases neurotransmitter levels of serotonin and norepinephrine by
inhibiting their uptake at presynaptic nerve terminals. Doxepin has antihistamine
properties by blocking H, and H2 receptors, and also has anticholinergic and
alpha-1-adrenergic blocking activities.

severe liver disease, esophagitis, or dysphagia. Unlike either oxytetracyclines or
tetracyclines, doxycycline can be used in patients with renal impainment
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Like other tetracyclines, doxycycline is a bacteriostatic agent that inhibits protein
synthesis by reversibly binding to 3os ibosomal subunits of susceptible organisms,
thereby preventing binding to those ribosomes of aminoacyl-transfer RNA.
Tetracyclines also are believed to reversibly bind to 5os ribosomes and, addition-
ally. alter cytoplasmic membrane permeability in susceptible organisms. The
immunomodulatory mechanism of action of doxycycline when combined
with niacinamide for the management of immune-mediated disorders is not
completely understood, but suppression of leukocyte chemotaxis secondary to
complement activation by antibody-antigen complexes and protease release
from leukocytes are possible mechanisms
DOSAGES
Dogs and cats
● Sterile inflammatory dermatoses, immune-mediated dermatoses, bacterial skin
infection: 5mg/kg PO q12h or 10mg PO q24h
For the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases, doxycycline should be tried for
at least 4-6 weeks prior to assessing its efficacy. Vvhen combined with niacinamide.

Dogs and cats: Skin and soft tissue infections including superficial and deep
pyodermas, wounds, and abscesses caused by susceptible Grar-negative bacilli
and cocci, including most species and strains of Pseuoomonas aeruginosa,
Proteus, Staphyiococcus (including penicillinase-producing and methicillin-resistant

Campylobacter. Shigelfa,Saimonella,Aeromonas, Haemophiius.Yersinia.
Serratia, Vibrio, Bruceffa, Chiamydia, Mycoplasma, and atypical mycobacterial
infection. Systemic enrofloxacin, concurrently with topical therapy. may also be
of benefit for treatment of chronic infections of the ear canal, particularly otitis
media, caused by susceptible organisms such as Pseudomonas; however, tissue
concentration is not known for the external or middle ear and this indication is
controversial with unpredictable efficacy.
Note: The authors do not recommend the use of fluoroquinolones as first-line
therapy for pyoderma. Fluoroquinolones should be considered primarily for
dhronic deep pyodermas associated with extensive scar tissue, because of their
excellent tissue penetration. Antibiotic selection, however, should be based on
qulture and susceptibility results.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in animals hypersensitive to fluoroquinolones. Contraindicated in
 young growing anirmals because of possible cartilage abnormalities. Enrofloxacin

use in breeding. pregnant, or lactating cats, as safety has not been determined
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Enrofloxacin is a bactericidal agent with broad-spectnum activity that inhibits bac-
terial DNA-gyrase (type ll topoisomerase), thereby preventing DNA supercoiling
 and DNA synthesis. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to have anti-inflarmratory

including Staphyiococcus and Streptococcus, Gram-positive bacilli including
Bacillus anthracis, Conynebacterium, Clostridium, (not C. cifficie), Listeria, and
Erysipeiothrix, some strains of Gram-negative bacilli, including Haemophilus,
Pasteurella, and Brucella. Some strains of Actinomyces, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia.
Ureaplasma, and Rickettsia are also inhibited by erythromycin. Usually, it has
good efficacy against staphylococcal pyoderma, but resistance is common.
It may be used as a second-line therapy for pyoderma5.
Note: Ideally, bacterial culture and sensitivity should be performed prior to
beginning therapy.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
 Do not use in anirals hypersensitive to erythrormycin or its class. In hurmans, the
estolate form has been rarely associated with the developrment of cholestatic hepa-
titis. This effect has not apparently been reported in animals, but the estolate form
should probably be avoided in patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Erythromycin is usually a bacteriostatic agent, but in high concentrations or
aqainst highly susceptible organisms it may be bactenicidal. Macrolides are
believed to act by binding to the 50S ribosormal subunit of susceptible bacteria,
thereby inhibiting peptide bond formation

Allerderm EFA-Caps? (US). Free Form Snip Tips? (US): Omegaderm? (US):
 many brands available
Classification: Anti-inflammatory Nutritional supplement
IN DICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Pnuritic and/or inflammatory conditions such as atopic demmatitis.
sebaceous adenitis, and symrmetrical onychodystrophy, and keratinization disorders
such as sebomhea and ichthyosis. They are unlikely to provide significant benefit
if adrministered as sole therapy. Essential fatty acids may work as glucocorticoid-
sparing agents and can also be used to improve coat quality and ameliorate
dry skin.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Caution in patients with coagulation disorders or receiving anticoagulant
medications, as fatty acids may affect bleeding time. Caution in patients with
non-insulin-dependent diabetes, as omega-3 fatty acids have impaired insulin
secretion with resultant increased glucose levels in humans with type 2 diabetes
Caution in patients with history of pancreatitis or protracted diarrhea. Safety in
 pregnant animals has not been established.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The exact mechanism of action of essential fatty acids is not well known.
However, by competing with arachidonic acid for the enzymes lipoxygenase
and cyclooxygenase, they decrease the synthesis of inflammatory leukotrienes
and prostaglandins in the body. thereby potentially reducing inflammation and
pruritus.
DOSAGES
Dogs and cats: There is no current evidence of superiority of any essential fatty
acid formulation, combination, dosage, or ratio to improve skin barrier and coat
quality or to reach anti-inflammatory effects in dogs with atopic dermatitis or
other inflammatory skin disorders. Specific dosage recommendations will vary

CONTRAINDICATIONS
(dosage may need to be reduced). In humans, ethambutol is contraindicated in
patients with ocular disorders including optic neuritis. Teratogenesis has beer
 reported in laboratory animals during pregnancy.
MECHANISM OF ACTIGN
Ethambutol is a bacteriostatic agent with antimycobacterial properties. Its exact
mechanism of action is unknown, but it diffuses into the mycobactenal cells and
 interferes with RNA synthesis, inhibiting intracellular metabolism and rmultiplication,
leading to cell death. Resistance can occur
DOSAGE
Ethambutol is often used as adjunctive therapy in combination with other
recommended antimycobacterial drugs
Dogs
● General dose: 10-15 mg/kg P0 q24h or 25mg/kg q72h for 3-6 months. May
be combined with one (or both) of the following antibiotics: enrofloxacin
Cats

SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs and cats: Side effects are not well documented in dogs and cats
Non-dose-related degenerative changes in the CNS, dose-related myocardial tox-
icity. and depigmentation of the tapetum lucidum of the eyes have been reported
 in dogs receiving long-terrm treatrment. However, doses as high as 400 mg/kg/day
for 4 weeks in dogs were associated with no significant changes in electroretino-
grar or visual evoked potential. In humans, ocular abnormalities such as reversible
optic neunitis causing decreased visual acuity, abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting
CNS signs, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. In addition, ethambutol-
induced penipheral neuropathy has been reported in rabbit5.

Dogs: Tail biting. flank sucking. anal licking. acral lick dermatitis.
Cats: Psychogenic alopecia and derrmatitis, tail sucking, excessive grooming,
hyperesthesia syndrome
Note: Fluoxetine is most effective when combined with a behavior modification
program.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to fluoxetine, other SSRls, or monoamine oxidase (MAO)
inhibitors. Should not be used in dogs with epilepsy or history of seizures or in
combination with drugs that lower the seizure threshold (e.g. acepromazine,
chlorpromazine). Fluoxetine dose adjustment may be needed in patients with
severe hepatic impairment. Caution in animals with diabetes mellitus, as it
may alter blood glucose. Caution in animals predisposed to aggression. Avoid
use in breeding. pregnant, and lactating animals, as safety has not been
determined
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Huoxetine and its primary metabolite, norfluoxetine, selectively inhibit serotonin 
leuptake in the brain and downregulate 5-HT, receptors, resulting in potentiation
of serotonin pharmacologic activity (antidepressive activity and rising in motor
activity thresholds). Fluoxetine also has minor dopamine and norepinephrine
reuptake inhibition properties.
DOSAGES
Dogs: 1-2 mg/kg PO q24h
Cats: 0.5-2 mg/kg PO q24h

Gabapentin
Trade/brand name: Gabarone@ (US), Neurontin@ (US, CA, UK), generic (Rx)
Classification: Neuropathic (analgesic)
IN DICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Management of neuropathic pain or pruritus and pares-
thesia. May be used in cases of idiopathic chronic pruritus unresponsive to
conventional therapy. chronic otitis commonly associated with neuropathic or
inflammatory pain, burn and nerve injury. canine acral lick dermatitis, feline
idiopathic ulcerative dermatosis, and feline hyperesthesia syndrome. There is
lirnited information regarding the use of this drug for dermatological condi-
tions in dogs and cats. In humans, it has also been used for the treatment of
brachioradial pruritus, cutaneous dysesthesia, neurotic excoriation. and
delusional parasitosis.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to gabapentin. Caution in patients with renal impairment and
behavior abnormalities. Avoid use of available human oral solution (Neurontin)
in dogs as it contains xylitol, which has been reported to cause hypoglycemia
and hepatotoxicity at doses greater than 0.1 g/kg. However, the use of 15 mg/kg
of the solution appears safe. Nonetheless, there is lirmited inforrmation on its
safety. In cats, xylitol toxicity does not appear to be a concern, but the solution
should also be used with caution in cats. Avoid use in pregnant animals. Avoid
abrupt withdrawal of drug.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Gabapentin is an analog of the neurotransmitter GABA, but it does not interact
with its receptors, inhibit GABA uptake or degradation, or convert into GABA
Gabapentin has analgesic and anticonvulsant properties: however, its exact
mechanism of action is unknown. It has been suggested that it increases the
synaptic levels of GABA in the CNS, most likely by increasing the synthesis of
 GABA. In addition, it has been demonstrated to bind to voltage-sensitive calcium
dannels in neuronal tissue and inhibit depolarization. It has been shown to
relieve hyperalgesia in skin that has been hypersensitized to pain
DOSAGES
Dogs and cats: 1-10mg/kg PO q24h. Start at the lower end of the dose range
and gradually increase dose to effect
Note: Therapeutic serum level is reported to range from 4 to 16 mg/mL; however.
serum levels are not necessarily monitored
Dogs
● Idiopathic pruritus unresponsive to conventional therapy: 11-15mg/kg PO
q8-12h. Clinical improvement should occur within 1-2 weeks of treatment.
If partial or no improvement, gabapentin dose can be increased up to 50% of
initial daily dose for another 12 weeks

pathogenic fungi or bacteria. Due to its immunomodulatory properties, it may
also be effective for the treatment of some non-infectious, inflammatory derma
toses such as canine juvenile cellulitis. The use of griseofulvin for the treatment
of inflarmmatory demmatoses is anecdotal, and the potential severe side effects
may outweigh its benefits. Since the advent of azoles, the authors have not used

griseofulvin in dogs and cats because of potential concerning side effects,
 particularly in cats.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to griseofulvin. Caution in animals with impaired hepatic
unction. Do not use in pregnant animals, because of its teratogenic effects, and
in breeding or lactating animals. Caution with administration in cats. Due to
potential exacerbation of bone mamow effects, griseofulvin should not be used

CONTRAINDICATIGNS
hydroxychloroquine should not be used in combination with dugs with a
tendency to produce dermatitis, as demmatologic reactions may occur. It is also
contraindicated in patients with risks of hemolysis, nisk factors for irreversible
letinopathy. muscle weakness, severe blood disorders, liver disease, concurrent

nase deficiency. It should be avoided during pregnancy, as the drug is known to
ooss the placenta in humans. Due to a previous report of acute cardiotoxicity in
anesthetized dogs receiving repeated intravenous high doses of hydroxychloro-
quine, and anecdotal reports of cardiotoxicity in humans, caution is warranted
when administenng this drug to dogs with cardiologic abnormalities.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Hydroxychloroquine is an aminoquinoline known to possess antimalarial and
immunomodulatory activities.  The exact immunomodulatory mechanism  is
unknown; however, it is thought to inhibit neutrophil phagocytosis and superoxide
pxroduction, chemotaxis, and toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 stirmulation.
DOSAGES
Dogs: 5-10mg/kg PO q24h
Note: In humans, hydroxychloroquine is usually taken with food or milk to
prevent gastrointestinal side effects.

Dogs: ln one study all three treated dogs receiving 5-10 mg/kg/day orally did not
show any adverse effects (electrocardiograms, ophthalmologic examinations,
CBCs, and chemistry profiles were normal compared to baseline throughout the
trial) (Mauldin et af. 2010). The hydroxychloroquine serum concentrations
measured at the end of the study. were within the human therapeutic range
(2.4-4mg/mL). One dog treated with hydroxychloroquine at 5 mg/kg/day also
did not show any adverse effects (Oberkirchner et al. 201 1). Acute cardiotoxicity

INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Histamine-mediated pruritic and allergic skin conditions
including urticaria and insect-bite hypersensitivity. Despite the widespread use of
antihistamines to treat canine atopic dermatitis, currently there is no conclusive
evidence of efficacy of oral type 1 antihistamines for treatment of chronic and
acute flares of canine atopic dermatitis (Olivry et af. 2010)
Note: For management of allergic skin diseases, the response to hydroxyzine in
dogs and cats, as with other antihistamines, is individualized and unpredictable

Classification: Immunomodulatory (immunosuppressive)
INDICATIQNS
Dogs and cats: At this time, there is insufficient evidence to recornmend
the widespread use of hlvlG for autoimmune skin diseases and cutaneous drug
reactions in dogs and cats. However, it might be warranted to use it for severe
cases of pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus vulgaris, and epidermolysis bullosa
acquisita that are refractory to conventional therapy. It may also be of benefit
in severe cases of vasculitis, drug reactions such as erythema multiforme,
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. In dogs, hlvlG has
been most commonly used for the treatment of immune-mediated hermolytic
anemia and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. It is important to take into
consideration the high cost of therapy and the potential induction of antihuman
IgG autoantibodies.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Due to the relatively high oncotic pressure of hlvlG. it should be used with
caution in patients with cardiac and renal diseases, and the concomitant admin-
istration of colloids should be avoided. Multiple doses should be avoided, as
 safety associated with repeated administrations has not been determined.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
 hIVIG is prepared fror pooled plasma from healthy human donors and contains
primarily intact lgG, with traces of lgA, lgM, CD4, CD8, and human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) molecules. Transfusion of these pooled immunoglobulins has
been shown to correct immune dysregulation. Proposed mechanisms of action
include functional blockade of Fc receptors on macrophages and effector cells,
inhibition of cell activation and cytokine synthesis, neutralization of circulating
autoantibodies and immune complexes, downregulation of autoantibody
production, blockade of complement activity and microbial activity. interference

start showing improvement 1-4 days after starting therapy. Azathioprine and/or
gucocorticoids should be started after 1-3 days of hlvlG as immunomodulating
agents to prevent relapses after the hlvIG has been cormpletely metabolized. These
drugs may be tapered and discontinued after several months of therapy without

tion has not been established.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Interferon alpha is a cytokine with antiviral and immunomodulating actions likely
due to its effects on the synthesis of RNA, DNA, and cellular proteins. Its antiprolif-
erative and antineoplastic activities might also be related to the effects on the syn-
thesis of RNA, DNA, and cellular proteins, but this is not known. Interferon alpha

MECHANISM OF ACTION
Interferon garmrma is a cytokine that plays an irmportant role as an immune
modulator. The mechanism by which interferon gamma acts to decrease skin
 inflammation in atopic demmatitis is unknown; however, in humans it is suggested
to shift the Th2-cytokine dominance towards Th1 dominance. In dogs with atopic
mRNA ratio in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, to significantly decrease the
serum total lgE levels, and to decrease the number of mast cells in the dermis
suggesting that in atopic dogs interferon gamma may act by modulating the Th2/
Th1 cytokine balance and by reducing serum total igE production
DOSAGES
There is limited clinical experience in dogs with interferon garmma for derrmato-

dermatitis, FeLV and Flv dermatitis, and papillomatosis. It may also be of benefit
in severe refractory cases of acne, gingivostomatitis (associated with feline calici-
vrus infection), and indolent ulcer.
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
 Do not use in patients hypersensitive to the drug, and do not vaccinate dogs and
cats receiving interferon. Caution in patients with pre-existing autoimmune dis-
ease, severe cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, uncontrolled diabetes, or CNS
disorders. Safety during pregnancy or lactation has not been established.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
hterferon omega is a type I interferon that has a similar mechanism of action to
interferon alpha. Type I interferons have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immu-
nomodulatory effects. In addition, they induce apoptosis of virus-infected cells
and promote CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cell responses by enhanc-
ing the expression of major histocompatibility class I (MHC-l) molecules. Type 1
nterferons also induce a form of nitric oxide synthase, which plays a role in
immune responses to infections
DOSAGES
There is limited clinical experience in dogs and cats with interferon omega for
dermatological diseases

lodide, Potassium
Trade/brand name: SSK/? (US). Pima? (US). generic (Rx)
Classification: Antifungal (inorganic halogen)
IN DICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Sporotrichosis. Historically, potassium iodide has been considered
the drug of choice for sporotrichosis in dogs and cats; however, serious adverse
effects associated with this agent led to its replacement with more effective and
safer antifungal drugs such as the azoles (e.g. itraconazole).
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Contraindicated in animals with iodide hypersensitivity. hyperthyroidism, renal
failure, dehydration, and in pregnant or lactating animals. Do not use the inject-
able form in dogs or cats.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
The exact mode of action of potassium iodide is unknown, as no fungicidal
effects have been observed in vitro; however, action may resultfrom enhancement
of the immune response of the host by stimulating the halide-peroxide killing
system of phagocytic cells, quenching toxic oxygen rmetabolites and inhibiting
neutrophil chemotaxis.
DOSAGES
Metallic taste is extremely unpleasant; give with food or a fatty liquid (whole
 milk, cream) to prevent nausea and vomiting.

Classification: Synthetic retinoid (second-generation)
INDICATIONS
There is no scientific or clinical evidence to encouraqe the use of isotretinoin to
 treat most of these dermatoses.
Dogs: Sebaceous adenitis, vitarmin-A responsive dermatosis, sebaceous gland
hyperplasia and adenoma, solar dermatosis, actinic keratosis, squamous cell car-
cinoma, infundibular keratinizing acanthomas (multiple keratoacanthomas or
intracutaneous cormifying epitheliomas), multiple epidermal inclusion cysts, ich-
thyosis, Schnauzer comedo syndrome, follicular dysplasias (e.g., color dilution
alopecia), inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus, idiopathic nasodigital
hyperkeratosis and ear margin seborrhea, epitheliotropic lymphoma. A recent
study also showed a potential benefit of retinoic acids (particularly 9-cis retinoic
acid or Alitretinoin at 2 mg/kg/day PO) for the treatment of pituitary-dependent
hyperadrenocorticism (Castillo et al. 2006): however, investigations have not
been performed with isotretinoin
Cats: Sebaceous adenitis, acne, epitheliotropic lymphoma.
CONTRAINDICATIONS

ymphocyte function, which can cause changes in cellular immune responses. In
addition, it reduces sebaceous gland size and activity. thereby reducing sebum
production. It also may indirectly reduce bacterial populations in sebaceous pores.

traconazole
Trade/brand name: Sporanox? (US, CA, UK), trafungo/@ (UK) (Rx)
Classification: Antifungal (third-generation azole, triazole)
IN DICATIONS
Dogs and cats: A variety of systermic mycoses including blastormycosis,
histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis, and coccidioidomycosis. Itracon-
azole is also used for the treatment of demmatophytosis, onychomycosis, and
Malassezia demmatitis. It may also be useful for treatment of aspergillosis,
candidiasis, pythiosis, lagenidiosis, zygomycosis, phaeohyphornycosis, hyalohy-
phomycosis, and otitis exterma caused by fungal organisms. ltraconazole is
considered by many demmatologists the antifungal of choice for demmatophytosis
in cats.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to itraconazole or other azoles. Caution in animals with irmpaired
hepatic function or achlorhydria (or hypochlorhydria). Avoid use in patients with
impaired ventricular function, as itraconazole has a negative inotropic effect and
may lead to congestive heart failure. Avoid use in pregnant animals, as it may be
teratogenic, and in nursing animals
Section 1: Systemic Drugs  113
MECHANISM OF ACTION
traconazole is a fungistatic triazole agent that inhibits ergosterol synthesis in the
fungal cell membrane by inhibiting the fungal cytochrome P450 sterol C14
intracellular components. In humans, itraconazole was shown to be incorporated
nto sebum and stratum corneum and to be detected in skin for 3-4 weeks after
treatment. Itraconazole also has immunomodulatory effects, probably by sup-
pressing T-lymphocyte proliferation. It does not have appreciable effects on
hormone synthesis, unlike ketoconazole.
DOSAGES
traconazole should be given with food for better absorption and bioavailability.
traconazole solution is well absorbed in cats even without food.

5 mg/kg Po q24h for 2 consecutive days per week seems to be as effective for
canine Maiassezia demmatitis as daily administration of ketoconazole at 10 mg/
kg (Bensignor Zoo8), which may be due to the persistence of itraconazole in
the stratum corneur for long periods after discontinuation of therapy.

● Uncommon: 7.5% of dogs treated with itraconazole at ≥10mg/kg/day may
develop ulcerative dermatitis and cutaneous vasculitis (lymphedema and/or
necrotizing lesions on one or more limbs) that may require dosage reduction to
5mg/kg/day or discontinuation of the drug. Increase in blood urea nitrogen
has also been reported

acariosis, nasal mites (Pneumonyssoidfes caninum)
Cats: Cheyletiellosis, otodectic acariosis, notoedric mange, follicular demodicosis
(Demodex cati)
Note: Demodex gatoi appears unresponsive to ivermectin, possibly because this
rmite parasitizes the skin surface, where the drug concentration may not be
adequate to kill the mite. Ideally, client informed consent should be obtained
prior to initiation of treatment, as the treatment of these conditions with
vermectin is extra-label.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Use in dogs and cats is extra-label. Canine breeds susceptible to ABCB1-1
(MDR1) allele mutation such as collies, Border collies, Shetland sheepdogs.
Australian shepherds, long-haired whippets, old English sheepdog. German
shepherds (especially white German shepherds),. silken windhounds, McNab
and herding-breed crosses should not receive ivermectin without testing
for the ABCB1-1 qene mutation. because of the higher risk of toxicity. Do
not use without up-to-date negative heartworm test, or in patients with
heartworm disease.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
kermectin, similar to other macrocyclic lactones, is neurotoxic to parasites by
increasing membrane permeability to chloride ions and potentiating the effects
 of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, leading to flaccid paralysis and death
of the parasite. Mammals are generally protected from neurological effects of
macrocyclic lactones.
DOSAGES
If toxicicity is noticed, drug must be discontinued.

Trade/brand name: Nizoral? (US. CA, UK), generic (Rx)
Classification: Antifungal (first-generation azole, imidazole)
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Maiassezia dermatitis, dermatophytosis, candidiasis, blastomy-
cosis, coccidiomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and leishmaniasis. It
should not be used solely as first choice for systeric mycosis (mainly if CNS or
eyes are involved) unless cost is an important factor. When combined with
amphotericin B the efficacy rate to treat systemic mycosis is comparable with
itraconazole alone. Ketoconazole is also used to treat canine hyperadreno-
corticism and to reduce cyclosporine dose in dogs.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
 Known hypersensitivity to the drug and pregnancy (teratogenic and ermbryotoxic
in laboratory animals). Caution in animals with liver disease or thrombocytope-
nia. Cats are very sensitive to the side effects of ketoconazole, and it should
be used cautiously or avoided in this species. Avoid in breeding male dogs as
ketoconazole may cause infertility by decreasing testosterone synthesis
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Ketoconazole interferes with the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component
loasauel ostd aouoi aun baiui Aa 'aueigwaw lan jebuny aun jo
118  Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
C 14-demethylase. It is fungistatic at commonly used doses. In mammals,
ketoconazole inhibits cortisol synthesis by blocking the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
enzyme 11 beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). It can also inhibit testosterone synthesis
by blocking CYP enzymes. Ketoconazole effect in increasing cyclosporine blood
levels results from the inhibition of the CYP enzyme CYP3A involved in the
metabolism of cyclosporine. Ketoconazole also has anti-inflarmmatory and
immunomodulatory effects such as inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activity, neutro-
 phil chermotaxis, and lyrnphocyte blastogenesis.

Leflunomide
Trade/brand name: Arava? (US. CA, UK) (Rx)
Classification: Immunomodulatory (immmunosuppressive)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Systemic and cutaneous reactive histiocytosis
Cats: Progressive histiocytosis.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Leflunormide hypersensitivity, pregnancy, bone marrow suppression, pre-existing
infection, liver dysfunction, other irnrnunosuppressive or hepatotoxic drugs, live
virus vaccines.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Leflunomide  reversibly  inhibits  the enzyme  dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
 involved in de-novo pathway of pyrimidine synthesis, resulting in decreased DNA
and RNA synthesis and inhibition of cell proliferation. Its antiproliferative effect
involves T and B lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Leflunomide
 is metabolized to the active form A77 1726 by the intestinal muco5a.
DOSAGES
Very limited available reports on the use of this drug in dogs and cats, and doses
reported are anecdotal.
Dogs: 2-4 mg/kg PO over 24 hours to obtain a serum through level of 20mcg/mL
Cats: 2-4 mg/kg PO over 24 hours. Cats metabolize the dnug much slower than
dogs and may require half the oral dose to attain adequate blood levels

Levamisole Hydrochloride
Trade/brand name: Ergamiso/? (US. CA), generic (Rx)
Classification: Immunomodulatory (immunostimulant). Antiparasitic
INDICATIONS
 Used as an immunomodulatory.
Dogs: Idiopathic recurrent pyoderma, systemic lupus erythematosus
Cats: Eosinophilic granuloma
Note: In humans, it can be used as adjunctive therapy for malignant melanoma,
with conflicting results.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Levamisole is not approved for lactating animals. Use cautiously in animals with
high burdens of heartworrm microfilaria, since reactions due to extensive micro-
filaria kill rate are possible. Avoid in severely debilitated animals or animals with
severe renal or hepatic disease.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The imrmunomodulatory mechanisrm of action of levamisole is not well known;
however, it is reported to restore the host defense by non-specific stirmulation of
Tcell-mediated immunity. Levamisole is also reported to stimulate monocyte and
neutrophil phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria. It is most effective in
immune-compromised individuals, and it has minimal to no effect in immune-
competent animals because stimulation above normal levels does not appear to
occur.
DOSAGES
t is important to be aware that the immunostimulatory dose range of levamisole
 narrow and not well defined, and inappropriate dosage may cause immuno-
suppression rather than immunostimulation.
Dogs
● Idiopathic recurrent pyoderma: 2.2 mg/kg P0 q48h (efficacy reported in 10%
of cases) or 0.5-2 mg/kg PO 3 times/week; use in conjunction with appropriate
antibiotic therapy
 Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
● Systemic lupus erythematosus: 2.5-5mg/kg PO q48h in conjunction with
prednisone at the initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg PO q12h. The prednisone is
tapered off within 1-2 months and the levamisole is continued as mainte-
nance therapy. This protocol was reported to show good response in 75 % of
 cases, with rermissions of months to years

Classification: Hormone
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Treatment of hypothyroidism
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Use with caution in hypoadrenocorticism (increased metabolism of adrenal
hormones may precipitate a hypoadrenocortical crisis), diabetes mellitus (increase
in body metabolism may potentiate ketoacidosis by increasing ketone synthesis).
congestive heart failure (increase in body metabolisrn may result in unnecessary
stress on the heart).
Section 1: Systemic Drugs 123
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Thyroid hormones influence various metabolic processes. They stirmulate calorigen-
esis, enzyme and protein synthesis, and synthesis, mobilization, and degradation
of cainbohydrates and lipids. They are essential for the development of the neural
and skeletal systems. Moreover, thyroid hormones have chronotropic and inotropic
tion, and influence the rate of secretion and degradation of all other hormones
DOSAGES
Administer levothyroxine ideally on an ernpty stomach, since food may reduce
bioavailability by about 45 %
Dogs: Start therapy with a brand-name product at 0.02 mg/kg PO q12h (max-
imum 0.8mg Po q12h). However, a recent study showed that levothyroxine
sorution administered once daily at the initial dose of 0.oz mg/kg controlled
hypothyroidism in 85% of the treated dogs (Traon et al. 2009). Re-evaluate
response in 4-8 weeks and readjust the dose based on improvement of
symptoms, serum T4 concentration, and signs of thyrotoxicosis. Serum T4 con-
centration should be evaluated 4-6 hours after levothyroxine administration
(peak level) if given twice daily. and it should be in the upper half of, or slightly
above, the reference interval. if the dosing frequency is once daily. blood
samples should be collected 24 hours after levothyroxine administration
(through level), and the hormone concentration should be in the middle of the
reference interval (>1.5 mcg/dL or 19.3 nmol/L)
Note: In animals with concurrent diseases, especially heart failure, start with
 25% of the recormrmended dose and increase by 25% weekly if no complication5
are noted.

MECHANISM OF ACTION
Similarly to other lincosamide antibiotics (e.g., clindamycin), lincomycin inhibits
bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of
sensitive organisms. Complete cross-resistance occurs between lincomycin and
clindamycin, and at least partial cross-resistance occurs between these two
antibiotics and the macrolide erythromycin. Lincosamides are typically bacterio-
static at the recommended dose, but can be bactericidal, depending on the

Lomustine
Trade/brand name: CCNU?(US. UK). CeeAU? (US, CA),. Lomustine (UK)
generic (Rx)
Cassification: Antineoplastic, Chemmotherapeutic
INDICATIGNS
Dogs and cats: Epitheliotropic and non-epitheliotropic lymphomas, mast cell
tumor, histiocytic sarcoma.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Avoid use in patients hypersensitive to lomustine. Caution if using with other
myelosuppressive agents (e.g.. chloramphenicol, flucytosine, colchicine) or
inmunosuppressive drugs (e.g., azathioprine, cyclosphospharnide, corticosteroids)
and live virus vaccines. Use with caution or avoid in patients with anemmia, bone
marrow suppression, pulmonary function impairment, current infections, renal or
 hepatic irmpairrment, or previous chernotherapy or radiotherapy.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Lomustine,also known as CCNU [1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl- 1-nitrosourea],is an
alkylating agent and a member of the nitrosourea family. The alkylating metabolite
binds preferentially at the O-6 of guanine, causing inter-strand crosslinking and cyto-
toxicity. It is lipophilic, resulting in high oral absorption and mermbrane penetration.
DOSAGES
Dogs: 50-90mg/m? (typical dose: 60-75 mg/m²) PO every 21-28 days until a
measurable response is achieved. Most dogs will have a response in 3-6 weeks.
Although typically 4-6 treatments with lomustine are planned at initiation of
therapy, the total number of treatrments given depends on tumor response and
tolerability of the patient to the chemotherapy. If progressive disease is observed
during this period of time, consider an alternative treatment. In a retrospective
study where 36 dogs with epitheliotropic lymphoma were treated with
lomustine, the median starting dose was 70mg/m? and the median number of
treatments administered was three (wwilliams et ar. zoo6). A measurable
response was seen in 78% of the cases, with 16% achieving complete response
The overall median response duration was 106 days. Another retrospective
study evaluating 46 dogs with epitheliotropic lymphoma reported a median
lomustine dose of 60mg/m? and a median of four treatments administered
(Risbon et ar. 2006). Complete remission was recorded in 33% of the cases.
but 83 % of the dogs experienced a measurable response. The overall median
Section 1: Systemic Drugs 127
response duration was 86 days. When lomustine was used to treat 23 dogs
with mast cell tumor at the dose of 9omg/m?. a measurable response rate
was noted in 42% of the cases and the response duration ranged from 21 to
440 days (Rassnick et af. 1999). Greater response rates have been achieved
combining lomustine with vinblastine for the treatment of canine mast cell
tumors (Cooper et al. 2009)
Treatment of 59 dogs with histiocytic sarcoma with lomustine at the dose
ange of 60-90 mg/m? resulted in an overall response rate of 46% and a median
survival time of 106 days (Skorupski et al. 2007)

SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs
● Common: myelosuppression in the form of neutropenia and thrombocyto-
penia. Nadir neutropenia typically occurs 7-10 days post-treatment and
thrombocytopenia at 7-21 days: higher doses and prolonged treatment
duration are more likely to cause myelosuppression; increase in liver enzyrmes
(typically ALT)
● Uncommon: hepatotoxicity has been reported to occur in 11/179 (6.1%)
cases, with 7/11 dying of progressive liver disease (Kristal et al. 2004). A recent
randomized clinical trial showed that Denamarin has a protective effect against
lomustine-induced hepatotoxicity (Skorupski 2010). Other uncommon side
effects include vomiting. diarrhea, weight loss, lethargy. unexplained fever,
renal toxicosis, bicavitary effusion
Cats
+ Common: neutropenia (median and mean day of neutrophil nadir was 14 and
15 days, respectively, in one study), thrombocytopenia (nadir platelet count

pleural effusion
Note: Lomustine is potentially embryotoxic and teratogenic
DRUG INTERACTIONS

Classification: Antihistamine (second-generation)
INDICATIONS
A double-blind, placebo-controlled randommized clinical trial evaluating the
efficacy of loratadine to treat dogs with atopic dermatitis was unable to show
sustained relief of pruritus in any of the treated patients (Paradis 1996). Moreover,
currently there is insufficient evidence in favor of or against recommending
second-generation antihistamines to treat dogs with atopic dermatitis
Note: If antihistamines are tried for the management of allergic skin diseases.
they should be given as preventative therapy and on a daily basis to keep the
histamine receptors blocked before histamine is released.
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Hypersensitivity to loratadine. Use carefully in patients with urinary tract
retention, angle-closure glaucoma, or pyeloduodenal obstruction. Loratadine
may reduce seizure threshold. Safety in pregnant dogs and cats is unknown
Antihistamines will interfere with intradermal testing results. Drug withdrawal is
usually recormmended for at least 2 weeks prior to allergy testing
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Loratadine is a second-generation antihistamine of the piperidine class. It binds
to H, receptors, blocking histamine binding.

Lufenuron ± Milbemycin Oxime
Trade/brand name: Program? (US. CA, UK). Sentine/? (US. CA, UK) (Rx)
Classification: Antiparasitic (insect growth regulator)
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Lufenuron is marketed for flea control in doqs and cats 4-6
weeks of age or older. It inhibits flea eggs from developing into adults and it is
often used in combination with an adulticide product. Despite the optimistic
results of a study showing rapid clinical and mycological resolution of dermato-
phytosis in cats and dogs treated with lufenuron (Ben-Ziony and Arzi 2o00),
additional reports and the experience of various dermatologists do not corrobo-
late the findings of this study. Lufenuron is not currently recommended as sole
therapeutic or preventive agent for feline or canine dermatophytosis, but it can
be used as adjunctive therapy.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
The cat injectable formulation may cause severe local reaction in dogs.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Lwfenuron is a benzoylurea compound and inhibits chitin synthesis, polymeriza-
tion, and deposition. Chitin is an important component of the exoskeleton of
insects. It is also present in fungal cell wall - thus the rationale for using lufenu-
 Ion to treat dermatophytosis.

have been conducted on client-owned cats to document clinical effect, and the
few reports that are available are anecdotal.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
None has been reported.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Arginine is an essential amino acid for FHV-1 replication, and lysine is thought to
antagonize the growth-promoting effect of arginine.
DOSAGES
 No studies have been conducted to detemnine the ideal dose regirmen for feline
herpetic dermatitis.

organisms such as Aseucomonas. However, tissue concentration is not known
for the extermal or middle ear canals, and this indication is controversial with
unpredictable efficacy.
Note: The authors do not recommend the use of fluoroquinolones as first-line
therapy for pyoderma. Fluoroquinolones should be considered primarily for
chronic deep pyodermas associated with extensive scar tissue, because of their
excellent tissue penetration. Antibiotic selection should be based on culture and
susceptibility results.

The pathomechanism associated with CNS effect is believed to be inhibition of
the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. It should not be used in dogs or cats with
hypersensitivity to marbofloxacin or other fluoroquinolones
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Marbofloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic and inhibits DNA supercoiling and
synthesis by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase (i.e., topoisomerase ll) and
topoisomerase IV. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to have anti-inflammatory
properties including inhibition of TNF-alpha synthesis and suppression of induced
leukotriene production by neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils
Sirmilarly to other fluoroquinolones, marbofloxacin accumulates inside inflamma-
tory cells, in particular macrophages

Masitinib Mesylate
Trade/brand name: Kinavet? (US). Masivet? (EU) (Rx)
Classification: Antineoplastic
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Masitinib mesylate is approved by the European Medicines Agency for
the treatment of grade ll or ll cutaneous non-metastatic, non-resectable, or
recurrent (post-surgery) mast cell tumors that have not previously received
radiotherapy or chemotherapy except corticosteroids. A double-blind, rand-
omized, placebo-controlled clinical trial showed that masitinib is effective in
delaying mast cell tumor progression and appears to have better efficacy in
patients that did not receive prior therapy (Hahn et al. 2008). Masitinib has
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed significant decrease
in pruritus scores and extent and severity of skin lesions in dogs with atopic
dermatitis treated with masitinib compared to dogs receiving placebo (Cadot
et af. 201 1).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. in dogs used
for breeding. and in pregnant or lactating bitches. Moreover, do not initiate
masitinib treatment in dogs with any of the following clinical pathological abnor-
 malities: albumin < 1 x lower limit of normal; urine protein-to-creatinine ratio > 1 ;
bood urea nitrogen or creatinine > 1 upper limit of nommal; hematocrit < 30% or

ated in dogs under 2 years of age. Masitinib cannot be safely dosed in dog5
<7 kg (1 5.4 lb) body weight. Refer to package insert for special precautions to be
taken by the person administering masitinib
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Masitinib mesilate is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the c-Kit receptor. It
has also shown to inhibit platelet-denived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-alpha,
PDGFR-beta and to a lesser extent fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-3
and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation pathway. Another target of masi-
tinib of interest to derrnatologists is Lyn, an intracellular kinase that interacts
with the high-affinity lgE receptor (FceRl), inhibiting FceRl-mediated degranulatior
of mast cells in vitro. This function of masitinib has spurred interest in investigat-
ing its effect in canine atopic dermatitis
DOSAGES
Dogs: 12.5mg/kg P0 q24h
Note: Treatment will require adjustments or permanent discontinuation in the
following circumstances
● Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio >2 or albumin <0.75 × lower limit of
normal: discontinue treatment until values returm to normal, then resume at
the same dose. If these events occur a second time, treatment should be
permanently discontinued
● Hemoglobin <8g/dL and free bilinubin >1.5 × upper limit of normal, or
hemoglobin <8g/dL and reticulocytes <80,000/mm²: treatment should be
discontinued
● In cases of ALT/AST increase >3 × upper limit of normal, neutrophil count
< 15oo/mm?, or any severe adverse event, adjust treatment as follows: at the
first occurrence, treatment is interrupted until resolution and then resumed at
the sarme dose level; if the event occurs a second time, treatrment is interrupted
until resolution and then dose is reduced to 9 mg/kg/day: if the event occurs a
third time, treatrment is interupted until resolution and then dose is reduced
to 6mg/kg/day: if severe adverse reactions still occur at the 6mg/kg/day dose,
treatment should be discontinued

Classification: Hormone
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Acral lick dermatitis
Cats: Self-inflicted symmetrical alopecia, indolent ulcer, eosinophilic plaque, or

Note: Megestrol acetate was originally marketed to suppress estrus in dogs.
Because of the potential severe side effects associated with megestrol acetate, it
is currently used by most veterinarians only when other treatment options have
failed.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, or mammary neoplasia.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Similarly to other progestational compounds, megestrol acetate suppresses the
release of gonadotropin and ACTH. According to the dose and the target organ,
it has variable effects on androgens and estrogens in different animal species. It
also induces the release of growth hormone and acts on the hypothalamus and
Imbic systems. Megestrol acetate has a potent anti-inflammatory effect and, in
the usual dose, it has been shown to cause stronger and longer-lasting adrenal

compensatory mechanisms for increased plasma volume, to avoid congestive
heart failure (Ployngam et al. 2006). Methyprednisolone will interfere with the
ntradermal test reactivity. Long-term use may also interfere with the allergy
serum test results. Drug withdrawal is usually recommended for at least 4 weeks
prior to allergy testing for oral administration and 8 weeks for injectable admin-
stration. Injectable methylprednisolone is considered unsuitable for managerment

response through inhibition of IL-12 synthesis and suppression of a Th-1
response, but promotion of a Th-2 response
DOSAGES
Dogs
● Allergic and inflammatory disorders: 0.8-1.0mg/kg PO q24h. After rermission
of clinical signs, reduce the dose to the lowest amount needed to maintain the
disease under control. Long-term treatment should be administered every
 other day, or less frequently if possible
● Autoimmune disorders: 0.8-1.5mg/kg PO q12h. If remission is not noted
after 7-14 days of the induction dose, combination immunosuppressive
therapy or a more potent oral glucocorticoid should be considered. Long-
term treatment should be administered every other day. or less frequently
if possible
Note: When used long-termn, the drug should be discontinued gradually. There
is no plausible justification for the use of long-acting injectable glucocorticoids
to mainage canine skin disorders, because of their potent effect on the hypotha-
lamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and potential for severe side effects. Therefore, the
authors do not recommend their use
Cats
● Oral methylprednisolone (Mecro/@)
0 A/lergic and infiammatory cisorders: 2.2 mg/kg PO q24h. After remission of

develop if glucocorticoids are not used carefully. Signs of iatrogenic Cushing's
in cats include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fragile skin, distended abdo-
men, alopecia, or hypotrichosis. Skin fragility syndrome may develop as the
sole sign of inappropriate glucocorticoid use

Methyltestosterone
Trade/brand name: Android? (US). Methitest? (US). Testred? (US). Viriion
(US). Orandrone (UK), generic (Rx)
Classification: Hormone (androgenic/anabolic)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Anecdotally recommended for neutered dogs with alopecia X. However,
because of the potential for serious side effects and lack of scientific evidence
supporting its use, the authors only recommend methyltestosterone for alopecia
 Xif all other treatrnent options have failed and owners insist on treating the pet's
alopecia despite its merely cosrmetic nature.
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Methyltestosterone should not be used in patients with liver disease or during
pregnancy. Treat animals with heart failure only if the benefits outweigh the
risks.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
 Methyltestosterone is an androgen with anabolic effects including stirmulation of
erythropoiesis, enhancement of nitrogen balance and protein anabolism, and
retention of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Its anabolic effects are medi-
ated by binding to nuclear DNA and altering the transcription of proteins respon-
 sible for cellular metabolism.
DOSAGES
Dogs: 1 mg/kg (maximum 30 mg) PO q24h until hair regrowth is noted (approx-
imately 1-3 months). Thereafter, 1 mg/kg (maximum 30 mg) q48h for 2 months,
followed by 1 mg/kg (maximum 30 mg) twice per week for 2 months, and finally

Classification: Antiparasitic (macrocyclic lactone)
IN DICATIONS
Dogs: Juvenile-onset generalized or adult-onset demodicosis, sarcoptic mange,
dheyletiellosis, and nasal mites (Pneumonyssoides caninum) infection. Flea control
if using Sentine/, which also contains lufenuron, an insect development inhibitor.
Note: Milbemycin oxime is licensed in the US, CA, and UK as a heartworm and
ntestinal parasite (e.g.. nematodes) preventative. Any other heartworm and
intestinal parasite preventatives should be discontinued during treatment with
millbemycin.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in dogs less than 4 weeks old or less than 1 lb (0.5kg). Milbemycin
oxime, similarly to ivermectin, is a rmernber of the macrolide farmily; however, it
has a higher index of safety when used in ivermectin-sensitive breeds. The
authors. nevertheless. recommend checking the ABCB1-1 (formerly MDR1)
genotype before using this drug in canine breeds susceptible to iverrmectin toxic-
ity such as collies, Shetland sheepdogs, Australian shepherds, old English sheep-
dogs, white Swiss shepherds, longhaired whippets, silken windhounds, McNab
and Border collies. Do not use without up-to-date negative heartworm test, or
in patients with heartworm disease
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Milbemycin oxime is a macrocyclic lactone that, similarly to other milbemycins
(.e., moxidectin), acts by potentiating glutamate- and GABA-gated chloride ion
dhannels in parasites, resulting in hyperpolarization of nerve cells, flaccid
paralysis, and parasite death.
DOSAGES
Dogs
● Generalized demodicosis: 0.5-2 mg/kg PO q24h for 30 days past two consecu-
tive negative skin scrapings obtained at intervals of 4-6 weeks. An evidence-
based review found good evidence for recormmending 2 mg/kg PO q24h for

Minocycline Hydrochloride
Trade/brand name: Minocin? (US. CA, UK). Arestin? (US, CA). Aknemine
(UK). generic (Rx)
Classification: Antibacterial (tetracycline), Anti-inflarmrmatory
Section 1: Systemic Drugs147
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Treatment of infections susceptible to minocycline. It has been
used in the treatrment of nocardiosis and actinormycosis. In one study, minocy-
dine was shown to be effective against 81.3% of rapidly growing members of
the genus Mycobacterium (Jang and Hirsh 2oo2). Because of its anti-inflamma-
tory effect, it could replace tetracycline in the combination therapy with niacina-
mide for the treatment of various sterile inflammatory skin disorders such as
discoid lupus erythematosus, German shepherd dog metatarsal fistulae, cutane-
ous reactive histiocytosis, sterile granuloma/pyogranulorma syndrome, sterile
nodular panniculitis, and lupoid onychodystrophy/onychitis
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to tetracyclines, pregnancy. nursing. animals less than 6 months
a6e 10
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Minocycline is a second-generation, long-acting. lipid-soluble tetracycline
Sirnilarly to other tetracyclines, minocycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit
and inhibits bactenial protein synthesis. It is mainly bacteriostatic. Minocycline
has a broad spectrum of action against Gram-positive (e.g.. some strains of
Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Bacillus anthracis. Nocardia)
and Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Bordetelfa, Bruceffa, Bartonelfa, Haemophiius.
Pasteurella multocida, Shigella,  Yersinia pestis). spirochetes. Chlamydia,
Mycopiasma, and Rickettsia. Additionaly. minocycline has an anti-inflarmmatory
effect completely independent of its antimicrobial action. It reduces the expres-
gon and activity of cyclooxygenase (COx)-2, caspases, IL-1-beta and prostaglan-
din E,. Moreover, it inhibits polymophonuclear cell and eosinophil chemotaxis
 and rmatrix metalloproteinase (it has been shown to reduce hypertrophic scarring
n a rabbit model)
DOSAGES
Dogs and cats
● Nocardiosis and actinomycosis: 5-25 mg/kg PO or IV q12h for at least 4 weeks
 past clinical resolution
● Atypical mycobacteriosis: 5-12.5mg/kg PO or IV q12h for at least 4 weeks
past clinical resolution
● Sterile inflammatory skin disorders (this dose regimen is empirical): 12.5-
25 mg/kg PO q12h for at least 6 weeks; if significant improvement is noted, it
should be continued to maintain the disease under control
Note: Selection of minocycline to treat infectious diseases should be based on
qulture and susceptibility results. Surgical removal of lesions and drainage are
commonly recommended as pairt of the treatment protocol for some diseases

SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs and cats
● Comrmon: vomiting and nausea. Administration with food can reduce these
 side effects without significant reduction in drug absorption
● Rare: increase in liver enzymes, ototoxicity. dental and bone discoloration
(yellow) if exposure to minocycline occurs in-utero or early in life; intravenous
adrministration in dogs has caused hypotension, shivering. dyspnea, cardiac
arrhythmias, urticaria and shock
Note: Photosensitivity reactions, rare blood dyscrasias, hepatotoxicity and

been reported in humans.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Antacids (oral), saline cathartics, or other gastrointestinal products
containing aluminum, calcium, magnesium, zinc, or bismuth cations: can
decrease the absorption of these antacids or tetracyclines; adrminister minocy-
cline 1-2 hours before or after these products
Iron: oral iron products should be administered 3 hours before or 2 hours after
tetracyclines because they may reduce their absorption
Isotretinoin: may increase the risk for nervous systerm effects when used with
minocycline
Kaolin, pectin, bismuth subsalicylate: may reduce minocycline absorption
Penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides: the bactericidal activity of the
penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides may be reduced by bacterio-
static drugs such as tetracyclines; however, the clinical significance of this effect
is debatable
Warfarin: patients on anticoagulants may need dose adjustment because tetra-
cyclines may decrease plasma prothrombin levels
MONItORING
● Efficacy and adverse effects
catalyzed iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin and coupling of
monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine; therefore, it seems advisable to monitor
thyroid function in patients receiving long-terrn minocycline therapy

However, its common gastrointestinal side effects, modest efficacy. and cost
do not make this drug a very attractive option as monotherapy for canine
atopic dermatitis.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
It should not be used in pregnant animals, since it may cause congenital malfor-
mation or embryotoxicity.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E, (PGE,) analog, and it is primarily used
25 an anti-ulcer medication because of its cytoprotective effect on the gastroin-
testinal mucosa. Misoprostol has also shown anti-inflammatory/anti-allergic
effects in various in-vivo and in-vitro studies in humans and rats. It inhibits the
late-phase reaction to intradermal allergen injections by reducing eosinophil
chemotaxis and survival but has no effect on the immediate cutaneous allergic
inflammation. It also inhibits histamine release from basophils and mast cells
after allergen-specific and non-allergenic stimulation. Moreover, it reduces the
secretion of IL-1-beta and TNF-alpha by endotoxin-stimulated monocytes.
A study in dogs showed that the modest effect of misoprostol in reducing the
dinical signs of dogs with atopic dermatitis does not appear to be mediated by
inhibition of inflammatory cells chemotaxis or reduction of TNF-alpha synthesis
(Olivry et al. 2003)
DOSAGES
Dogs: 5 mcg/kg PO q8h. Perform a 4-6-weeks trial. If no significant reduction in
pruritus and skin lesions consider another treatment option.

Mitotane (o,p'-DDD)
Trade/brand name: Lysodren? (US. CA, UK) (Rx)
Classification: Hormone, (adrenolytic agent)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Pituitary-dependent (primaily) or adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in pregnant or lactating animals. Use cautiously in animals with
hepatic or renal diseases.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Mitotane binds to cells of the adrenal cortex and forms a reactive metabolite,
resulting in cormplete or partial necrosis of the adrenal cortex according to the
dosage used. This effect is relatively specific, and cells of the zona reticularis and
fasciculata are typically affected. However, in a small percentage of dogs, cells of
the zona glomenulosa will also be destroyed, resulting in aldosterone deficiency.
DOSAGES
Dogs
● Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism: during the induction phase give
50 mg/kg Po divided twice a day until one of the following occurs first: 7-10
days of therapy: or signs of corticosteroid deficiency develop such as lethargy.
depression, vomiting. and/or diarrhea; or dog refuses to eat or appetite is sig-
nificantly reduced. vwhen one of these end points is reached, the treatment is
discontinued and an ACTH stimmulation test is performed to evaluate the
degree of adrenal necrosis induced by the dnug. If the post-ACTH cortisol
serum level is between 2 and 4mcg/dL (55.18-110.36nmol/L) the mainte-
nance dose is instituted at 50 mg/kg PO per week divided in 2-3 administra-
tions. An ACTH stirmulation test should be performed after 30-90 days and the
maintenance dose adjusted as needed
● Adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism: 50-100 mg/kg PO divided twice a
day. Follow the same end points discussed above to decide when to start main-
tenance therapy: however, the induction phase may be longer for cases of
adrenal tumor, and the maintenance dose may need to be readjusted more
frequently.
Note: At any point during therapy. the dog may develop signs of corticosteroid
deficiency, and a low dose of prednisolone or prednisone (0.25 mg/kg PO q24h)
should be adrministered. Make sure to discontinue the oral prednisone or predni-
solone at least 24 hours before the ACTH stimulation test, since these drugs
cross-react with the measured serum cortisol. To improved oral absorption and
 systermic bioavailability. adrninister the drug with food rich in oil/fat content.

SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs
● Common: usually associated with glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid
deficiency. and include lethargy. depression, ataxia, anorexia, vomiting and/or
diarrhea. If any of these adverse effects occurs, discontinue the mitotane and
administer a low dose of oral glucocorticoid (e.g.. prednisolone at 0.25 mg/kg
PO q24h). If no improvement is noted within 3 hours, the dog should be exam-
ined immediately for an ACTH stimulation test and evaluation of at least Nat

DRUG INTERACTIONS
Drugs that cause CNS depression: potential additive depressant effects
Phenobarbital: can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes and may reduce the
efficacy of mitotane
Spironolactone: has been shown to block the action of mitotane in dogs
Warfarin: mitotane may induce hepatic microsomal enzymes and increase the
metabolism of warfarin
MONItORING
● Response to therapy: periodic ACTH stirmulation tests
● Adverse effects: owners should be educated to monitor the dog's water con-
sumption and food intake and signs of corticosteroid deficiency. If water con-
sumption and food intake are reduced significantly. mitotane therapy should
be discontinued and the veterinarian should be contacted. If signs of corticos-
teroid deficiency are noted, mitotane therapy should be discontinued, a small
dose of glucocorticoid administered, and the veterinarian contacted
● Chemistry profile should be performed at baseline and regularly at recheck visits
Moxidectin
Trade/brand name: Cydectin? (US). Proheart 6?(US, CA). Guardian? (CA) (Rx)
Classification: Antiparasitic (macrocyclic lactone)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Generalized demodicosis, sarcoptic mange, and otoacariosis.
Cats: Otoacariosis
Note: Moxidectin is not labeled in the US for the treatment of these disorders in

CONTRAINDICATIONS
Animals with known hypersensitivity to the drug. It should be used cautiously or
avoided in animals with ABCB1-1 (formerly MDR1) mutation, at the extra-label
152Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
dosages recormmended for the treatment of acarioses. Do not use without
up-to-date negative heartworm test, or in patients with heartwonn disease.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Moxidectin is a macrocyclic lactone in the milbemycin class produced by the
fermentation of actinomycetes. It interacts with GABA and glutamate-gated
channels, which increases the influx of chloride ions into the cell and results in
flaccid paralysis and death of the parasite
DOSAGES
Dogs
● Generalized demodicosis: 0.2-0.5mg/kg PO q24h. A recent evidenced-based
review of treatment protocols for canine demodicosis reported good evidence
ment of generalized demodicosis (Mueller 2004). To monitor for potential side
effects (particularly in puppies). it is recommended to increase the dose
gradually by 0. 1 mg/kg per day until the desired dose is achieved (e.g.. O.1 mg/kg
on day 1. followed by 0.2mg/kg on day 2. etc.). Treatment for generalized
demodicosis should be continued for 30 days past two consecutive negative
skin scrapings at 2-4-week intervals. The patient should thereafter be moni-
tored for 1 year before declared cured
● Sarcoptic mange: 0.2-0.25 mg/kg PO or SC weekly for 3-6 weeks. This dose is
based on one anecdotal study (VWagner and Wvendlberger 20oo). In this study.
the duration of treatment (3-6 weeks) was based on resolution of clinical
signs; therefore, if a treatment trial is performed when no mites are found on
skin scrapings ideally at least 6 treatments should be administered.
●Otoacariosis: 0.2mg/kg PO or SC administered twice at 10 days apairt.
However, re-infestation may occur with this protocol and additional treatment
may be required.
Cats
● Otoacariosis: 0.2 mg/kg SC. Re-evaluate in 30 days to determine if additional

IN DICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Skin and soft tissue infections caused by susceptible Gram-
negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. The chemical structure of moxifloxacin
 slightly different from the second-generation veterinary fluoroquinolones
(enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin, danofloxacin, and marbofloxacin), giving this com-
pound a greater activity against anaerobes and Gram-positive cocci. A recent
in-vitro study showed that moxifloxacin may be efficacious for the treatment of
apidly growing mycobaterial infections associated with Mycobacterium fortui-
tum and M. smegmatis in dogs and cats (Govendir et af. 2o1 1)
Note: Moxifloxacin is not cormmonly used, because veterinary fluoroquinolones
are prefemed for initial treatment. The authors do not recommend the use of
be based on culture and susceptibility results
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Huoroquinolones can be potentially toxic to chondrocytes and should not be
given to immature dogs during their rapid growth phase (small and medium-
sized breeds between 2 and 8 months, large breeds younger than 12 months,
154  Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
giant breeds younger than 18 months). Cautious use is advised for animal5
susceptible to seizures (e.g.. epileptics)
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone that inhibits DNA supercoil-
ing and synthesis by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase (type ll topoisomerase).
Similarly to other fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin is bactericidal in a concentra-
tion-dependent manner and accumulates inside inflammatory cells, in particular
macrophages.

SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs and cats: vomiting may occur occasionally. Arthropathy may occur in
young animals. Dogs between 4 and 28 weeks of age, and large rapidly growing
dogs, are the most susceptible. CNS toxicity may develop with high drug concen-
trations, especially in anirmals with renal failure. High doses of moxifloxacin have
been associated with prolonged QT interval, but the clinical significance of this
 finding is currently unknown.

Nitenpyram
Trade/brand name: Capstar? (US. CA. UK). generic (Rx)
Classification: Antiparasitic (neonicotinoid)
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Flea control in dogs and cats 4 weeks of age or older
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Not labeled for animals younger than 4 weeks or <1 kg body weight.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Nitenpyram binds to postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and blocks
acetylcholine-mediated neuronal transmission, resulting in paralysis and death of
the flea. Manufacturer states that it starts working in 30 minutes. Studies have
shown that it kills adult fleas within 6 hours of application.
DOSAGES
Dogs: 11.4mg tablet PO q24h (dogs 1-11.4kg or 2-25Ib): 57 mg tablet PO
q24h (dogs 11.5-56.8kg or 25.1-125 Ib)
Cats: 11.4 mg tablet PO q24h (cats 111.4kg or 2-25 Ib)
Note: A single dose is usually needed: however, it can be administered once
daily several times as needed. It should be combined with an insect growth
regulator or insect development inhibitor such as Frontline Plus, Sentine/, or

Norfloxacin
Trade/brand name: Moroxin? (US, CA, UK). Apo-Norffox? (CA). generic (Rx)
Classification: Antibacterial (second-generation fluoroquinolone)
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections associated with
susceptible bacteria such as Staphyiococcus, Aseucfomonas, Proteus, Escherichia
coli. Norloxacin has less activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than other
fluoroquinolones. Veterinary fluoroquinolones have more favorable pharmacoki-
netics and a superior spectrum of activity compared to norfloxacin. Norfloxacin,
concurrently with topical therapy may be of benefit for treatment of chronic ear
infections, particularly otitis media, caused by susceptible organisms; however,
tissue concentration is not known for the extermal or middle ear, and this indica-
tion is controversial with unpredictable efficacy.
Note: The authors do not recommend the use of fluoroquinolones as first-line
ceptibility results. Fuoroquinolones should be considered primarily for chronic
deep pyodermas associated with extensive scar tissue, because of their excellent
tissue penetration
CONTRAINDICATIONS
given to irmmature dogs during their rapid growth phase (small and medium-
sized breeds between 2 and 8 months, large breeds younger than 12 months,
giant breeds younger than 18 months). Norfloxacin may cause CNS stimulation
and should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizure activity. The
pathomechanism associated with CNS effect is believed to be inhibition of the
inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA
MECHANISM OF ACTIGN
Norfloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic and inhibits DNA supercoiling and synthe-
 sis by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase (a type Il topoisomerase). Similarly to
other fluoroquinolones, norfloxacin accumulates inside inflammatory cells, in
particular macrophages. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to have anti-
 inflarnmatory properties including inhibition of TNF-alpha synthesis and suppres-
sion of induced leukotriene production by neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,
and basophils.
DOSAGES
Dogs and cats: 22 mg/kg PO q12h for 7-14 days past resolution of clinical sign5
Note: The twice daily administration is a disadvantage compared to the veteri-
nary fluoroquinolones.

SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs and cats: Norfloxacin is generally well tolerated, but it may cause vomit-
ing. diarrhea, and soft stools at high doses. CNS toxicity may develop at high
 concentrations, especially in animals with renal failure. Arthropathy may develop
in young animals. and rapidly growing dogs at 4-28 weeks of age are more
yusceptible
DRUG INTERACTIONS

medium-sized breeds between 2 and 8 months, large breeds younger than 12
months, giant breeds younger than 18 months). Orbifloxacin may rarely cause
CNS stimulation and should be used cautiously in patients with a history of
seizure activity. The pathomechanism associated with increased CNS activity
appears to be inhibition of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. It should
not be used in dogs or cats with hypersensitivity to orbifloxacin or other
fluoroquinolones.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
 Orbifloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic and inhibits DNA supercoiling and synthe-
sis by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase (a type ll topoisomerase). Similarly to
other fluoroquinolones, orbifloxacin accumulates inside inflammatory cells, in
particular macrophages. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to have anti-

Classification: Antibacterial (potentiated sulfonamide)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Orrmetoprim +sulfadirmethoxine is approved to treat canine bacterial skin
infections and soft tissue infections caused by susceptible staphylococcal strains
Note: Antibiotic selection should be based on culture and susceptibility results
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
 Dogs sensitive to sulfonarmides, and those with severe liver parenchyrnal damage
and blood dyscrasias. Animals with low Schirmer's tear test values should not be
treated with sulfonamides. Use cautiously in Doberman pinschers, sarmoyeds,
and miniature schnauzers, as these breeds have been reported to have a high
risk for developing reactions to sulfonarmides.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Potentiated sulfas are bactericidal and sequentially inhibit the enzymes involved
in the folic acid pathway, resulting in the inhibition of bacterial thymidine synthe-
is. The sulfonamide inhibits the conversion of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to
dhydrofolic acid, and ormetoprim inhibits the conversion of dihydrofolic acid to
tetrahydrofolic acid by inhibiting the bacterial enzyme dihydrofolate reductase

and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Antibiotic selection should ideally be based on cul-
ure and susceptibility results. Oxacillin is typically used as the surrogate anti-
biotic for methicillin in susceptibility tests. Staphyiococci strains resistant to
Oxacillin should be considered resistant to all cephalosporins.

Trade/brand name: Serax (US), generic (Rx)
Classification: Tranquilizer, CNS depressant, Benzodiazepine
INDICATIGNS
Management of psychogenic dermatoses mostly associated with anxiety.
Benzodiazepines, such as oxazepam, are short-temm anxiolytics and therefore
may be more effective for acute or time-limited stress. It is important to note that
environmental and behavior management used concurrently may increase the
efficacy of any pharmacologic intervention.
Dogs: Self-mutilations, acral lick derrmatitis, excessive tail or nail biting/chewing.

CONTRAINDICATIONS
Use cautiously in patients with known sensitivity to the drug or other methylxan-
thine derivatives, in patients with cerebral or retinal hemorrhage, in those at risk
for hemorrhage, and in those with severe hepatic or kidney impairment.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine derivative with rheologic and immunomodula-
tory properties. Its rheologic effect (blood flow modulation) is mediated by
ncrease in erythrocyte and leukocyte deformability, decrease in fibninogen levels
and increase in fibrinolytic activity (both effects as a result of prostacyclin stirmu-
btion). decrease in platelet aggregation, decreased leukocyte adhesion and
aggregation, and increase in neutrophil chemotaxis and motility. The blood flow
modulation will ultimately result in increased peripheral tissue perfusion and
oxygenation. Its immunomodulatory effect is mediated by decrease in cytokine
production (IL-1, IL-4, IL-12, TNF-alpha), decrease in leukocyte responsiveness to
IL-1 and TNF-alpha, inhibition of B- and T-lymphocyte activation, decrease in
natural killer cell activation, inhibition of T-cell adherence to keratinocytes, and
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition. Pentoxifylline also has an effect in wound
healing by increasing collagenase production and decreasing the synthesis of
collagen, fibronectin, and glycosaminoglycans,

Trade/brand name: Ppraci/ (US) (Rx)
Classification: Antibacterial (beta-lactam)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: In veterinary dermatology. piperacillin sodium has been rarely used for
 susceptible Pseucfomonas otitis cases. It is typically used as adjunctive therapy in
refractory cases, in conjunction with topical treatment.
Note: As for any case of Pseudomonas otitis, this antibiotic choice should be
based on bacterial culture and susceptibility results
Section 1: Systemic Drugs
171
CONTRAINDICATIONS
High doses contribute to the patient's sodium load and may adversely affect
 patients with hypernatreric disorders and heart failure.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Fiperacillin is a beta-lactam bacteriostatic antibiotic of the acylureidopenicillin
dass. Similarly to other beta-lactam antibiotics, piperacillin binds to penicillin-
binding proteins (carboxypeptidases, transpeptidase5, endopeptidases) involved
in the bacterial cell wall mucopeptide synthesis, resulting in cell wall weakness or
ysis and osmotic instability. Similar to other penicillins, it is a time-dependent
drug (i.e., drug concentration should ideally be maintained above the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) during the dose interval for better efficacy) and it
 very active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

(e.g., squamous cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, nasal and gastroin-
testinal carcinomas) and the adjacent stromal tissues show expression of the
inducible COX-2 enzyme. At the cancer cell level, COX-2 expression is linked to
apoptosis resistance, stimulation of cancer cell proliferation, and enhanced cell
migration. The stromal expression promotes neovascularization and altered
macrophage function. In addition, Cox-2 expression is associated with direct
oxidative darmage to DNA and increased production of the P-glycoprotein MDR 1
(ABCB1-1), which confers multi-dnug resistance. Its antineoplastic effects are
therefore thought to be associated with the induction of apoptosis and the inhi-
 bition of tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis.

PO7P (Chinese Herbal Supplement)
Trade/brand name: Phytopica? (UK)
Classification: Anti-inflammatory. Herbal supplement
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Po7P is labeled for sensitive skin and atopic dermatitis. One double-blind
Phytopica@ can be an effective glucocorticoid-sparing agent (sirnilarly to antihis-
tamines and pentoxifylline) in the management of canine atopic dermatitis
CONTRAINDICATIONS
No information available
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Standardized mixture of extracts obtained from three plants (Glycyrrhisa uraren-
sis, Paeonia lactiffora, Rehmania giutinosa). These extracts have been shown to
have immunomodulatory properties, which might explain the potential benefit
for atopic dermatitis. G. urarensis potentiates the expression of the immunosup-
pressive cytokine IL-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, inhibits
cytochrome P45o, induces apoptosis in leukemic cells, and has antioxidant and
antibacterial activities. R. glutinosa inhibits production of pro-inflarmmatory
cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha and IL- 1), suppresses histamine release and cyclooxigenase

activity in rodent cell models, and has an antioxidant effect in vitro. P lactiffora
inhibits cyclooxygenase activity in leukocytes and nitric oxide synthase in acti-
vated macrophages, induces apoptosis in leukemic cell lines, and has antioxidant
activity.
DOSAGES

Posoconazole
Trade/brand name: Noxafil? (US. UK). Posano/@ (CA) (Rx)
Classification: Antifungal (triazole, second-generation)
INDICATIONS
 Posoconazole is approved for the treatment of human oropharyngeal candidia-
sis, and for the prevention of invasive Canoida and Aspergillus infections in
patients at high risk for acquiring infections with these agents. Moreover, it has
been reported to be efficacious against various other yeasts and filarmentous
fungi such as Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Fusarium,
Rhizopus, Mucor, and zygomycetes.
Cats: It was used successfully in a cat with invasive orbital asperqillosis after
itraconazole and amphotericin B had failed (McLellan et ar. 2006)
Dogs: No reports on the use of posoconazole to treat canine fungal infections
are available.
CONTRAINDICATIONS

used during pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the risks. The concomitant
use of posoconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapide, pimozide, halofan-
trine, or quinidine (all CYP3A4 substrates) is contraindicated because of poten-
tial for QT interval prolongation.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Posoconazole is a lipophilic broad-spectrum, second-generation triazole with a
molecular structure similar to that of itraconazole. Like other triazoles it inhibits
synthesis, which is an important component of the fungal cell wall.
DOSAGES
Posoconazole should be taken with food (ideally a high-fat meal) to enhance
absorption.

Pradofloxacin
Trade/brand name: Veraffox? (EU) (Rx)
Classification: Antibacterial (third-generation fluoroquinolone)
INDICATIONS
Dogs:  Pradofloxacin  is a novel  third-generation fluoroquinolone  currently
approved in Europe to treat canine wound infections and superficial and deep
pyoderma associated with susceptible strains of Staphyrococcus pseudinterme-
dius. However, it has shown lower mminimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) when

pradofloxacin has shown excellent in-vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria
isolated from dogs and cats. Pradofloxacin, concurrently with topical therapy.
may also be of benefit for treatment of chronic ear infections, particularly otitis

concentration is not known for the extermal or middle ear, and this indication is
controversial with unpredictable efficacy
Note: The authors do not recommend the use of fluoroquinolones as first-line
therapy for pyoderma. Fluoroquinolones should be considered primarily for
chronic deep pyodermas associated with extensive scar tissue, because of their
excellent tissue penetration. Antibiotic selection, however, should be based on
culture and susceptibility results.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Fuoroquinolones can be potentially toxic to condrocytes and should not be
given to immature dogs during their rapid growth phase (small and medium-
sized breeds between 2 and 8 months, large breeds younger than 12 months,
qiant breeds younger than 18 months). Moreover, do not use pradofloxacin in
dogs with chronic articular cartilage lesions, to avoid worsening of lesions during
treatment. Pradofloxacin may cause CNS stimulation and should be used cau-
tiously in dogs with a history of seizure activity (mainly patients receiving NSAIDs
because of potential phammacodynamic interactions in the CNS). The patho-
mechanism associated with CNS effect is believed to be inhibition of the inhibi-
tory neurotransmitter GABA. Do not use pradofloxacin in pregnant or lactating
dogs, as safety data are not available. Use cautiously in dogs with abnormal
kidney function, as the drug is primarily excreted by the kidneys in this species.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Pradofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone that inhibits DNA supercoil-
ing and synthesis by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
Section 1: Systemic Drugs
177
Because of these two fluoroquinolone targets, development of resistance is less
ikely than with other fluoroquinolones. Similarly to other fluoroquinolones, pra-
dofloxacin accumulates inside inflarmmatory cells, in particular in macrophages
DOSAGES
Dogs: The manufacturers recommended dose is 3 mg/kg PO q24h; however,
because of the available tablet sizes the prescribed dose may range from 3 to
4.5 mg/kg PO q24h. It should be administered for 7-14 days past resolution of
dinical signs.
FORMULATIONS
Veterinary-labeled products: Currently only available in Europe
● Oral tablets: 15mg. 60 mg. 120 mg: Veraffox@
Human-labeled products: None
SIDE EFFECTS
Dogs: pradofloxacin is generally well tolerated, but it may cause nausea, vomit-
ng. diamhea, soft stools, lethargy. These signs are typically mild and transient. It
can induce seizure when administered at high doses.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Antacids containing divalent or trivalent cations (e.g., Mg", Al+, Ca+),
iron, zinc: decrease pradofloxacin absorption; separate administration of these
products and pradofloxacin by at least 2 hours
Aminoglycosides, third-generation cephalosporins, extended spectrum

using imrnunosuppressive doses of glucocorticoids. Use glucocorticoids cautiously
in cats with any cardiovascular disorders that alter the compensatory mechanisms
for increased plasma volume, to avoid congestive heart failure (Ployngam et af.
 2006). Prednisone and prednisolone will interfere with the intradermal and allergy
serum test results. Wwithdrawal of oral administration of these drugs is usually
 recormmended for at least 4 weeks prior to allergy testing. Injectable prednisone
and prednisolone are considered unsuitable for management of chronic derma-
tologic diseases due to potential severe effect on the HPA-axis
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids are complex. Through genomic and
non-genomic mechanisms they exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive
effects by decreasing the synthesis of inflarmmatory cytokines, chermokines.

ing the expression of lipocortin-1); enhancing the clearance of foreign antigens;
suppressing the cellular immune response through inhibition of IL-12 synthesis
and suppression of a Th-1 response, but promotion of a Th-2 response.
DOSAGES

ticoids are not used appropriately. Signs of iatrogenic Cushing's in cats include
polyuna, polydipsia, polyphagia, fragile skin, distended abdomen, alopecia or
hypotnichosis. Skin fragility syndrome may develop as the sole sign of inappropri-
ate glucocorticoid use. Congestive heart failure has been reported in cats treated
with corticosteroids (Smith et af. 2o04). Diarrhea and depression may also occur

Propionibacterium acnes Injection
Trade/brand name: immunoregulin? (US) (Rx)
Classification: lmmunomodulatory (immunostimulant)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Propionibacterium acnes is available as a killed bacterial vaccine labeled
for use in conjunction with antibiotic therapy to manage chronic recurrent
canine pyodemma. This treatment modality has the goal of decreasing the extent
and severity of pyoderma lesions and increasing the interval between episodes
of recumences. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. dogs
with chronic, recurrent pyoderma received antibiotic therapy and an injection of
Propionibacterium acnes or placebo (Becker et ar. 1989). At the end of the
12-week treatment duration, 12/15 (80%) dogs treated with antibiotic and
P acnes improved significantly, or pyoderma lesions completely resolved, com-
 pared to 5/13 (38%) dogs in the placebo group.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
P acnes injection should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to it. It is
recornmended to withdraw glucocorticoid or other irmunosuppressive agents
reduction of its immunostimulant effect. Use cautiously in animals with cardiac
dysfunction. Safety in pregnant animals has not been evaluated.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The immunostimulant mechanism of P acnes injection is non-specific. It may
enhance cell-mediated immunity. increase the activity of natural killer cells, and
induce lymphokine production and macrophage activation.
DOSAGES
Dogs: Administer intravenously at the following dosages: 0.25 mL (dogs ≤6.8kg
or 15Ib): 0.5mL (dogs 6.8-20.5kg or 15-45Ib): 1mL (dogs 20.5-34kg or
45-75Ib): 2mL (dogs >34kg or 75lb). Administer twice weekly for the first 2
weeks, then once weekly until the 12th week. Anecdotal reports indicate that if
response occurs, it should be seen within 12 weeks of therapy. Monthly mainte-
nance therapy may be recommended

actamase-resistant antibiotic for cases of canine chronic pyoderma where other
treatment options have failed, or for cases of methicillin-resistant Staphy/ococcus
pseudintermedius infections susceptible to the drug. It has also been used to
treat canine actinomycosis, aspergillosis, histoplamosis, and mycobacterial infec-
tions in dogs and cats
Note: Major limiting factors associated with the use of this antibiotic include
lapid development of resistance (thus the need for combined antibiotic therapy)
and the potential for the developrment of severe hepatotoxicity.
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
 Patients hypersensitive to rifampin or other rifarmycins. Patients with pre-existing
Iver disease. Use cautiously in patients with risk for pancreatitis.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Rifampin is a lipid-soluble antibacterial agent that is active in acid pH and has
good intracellular penetration. Its spectrum of action includes staphylococci,
streptococci, and mycobacteria. It inhibits RNA synthesis in susceptible organ-
sms by inhibiting the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme. It can be bacte-
licidal or bacteriostatic according to the drug concentration and organism
susceptibility.
DOSAGES
Rifampin should be administered on an empty stomach, as food reduces its
extent and rate of absorption.

 interactions with these drugs.
MONItORING
+ Efficacy and adveise effects
● Efficacy is monitored by observing changes in clinical signs and not based on
test results (i.e., ACTH stimulation test or low-dose dexamethasone suppression
test). A metabolite of selegiline (L-amphetamine) is a potent sympathorninmetic
and CNS stimulant; therefore, owners' perceived improvement in the behavior
of their geriatric dogs may not be directly related to improvement of PDH
Sertraline Hydrochloride
Trade/brand name: Zoloft? (US). Lustra/ (UK) (Rx)
Classification: Behavior modifying drug (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
INDICATIGNS
Management of psychogenic dermatoses associated with anxiety-related or
other obsessive-compulsive behaviors.
Dogs: Tail biting. flank sucking. anal licking. acral lick dermatitis
pulling. hyperesthesia syndrome.
Note: Sertraline is most effective when combined with a behavior modification
program.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Avoid in patients with hypersensitivity to this dnug. and in those receiving monoam-
ine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, (e.g., selegiline) or L-tryptophan. Use cautiously in
 patients with seizure disorders or taking drugs that lower the seizure threshold (e.g..
acepromazine, chlorpromazine), and in patients with cardiac, liver, or renal disease
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Sertraline selectively inhibits serotonin reuptake in the CNS and downrequlates
5-HT, receptors, resulting in potentiation of serotonin pharmacologic activity
(antidepressive activity). Sertraline has minor dopamine or norepinephrine reup-
take inhibition properties.
DOSAGES
Dogs: 1-3 mg/kg PO q24h
Cats: 0.5-1 mg/kg PO q24h

arrhythmias.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
The exact mechanism of action of sodium stibogluconate is unknown. It is
believed that it interferes with energy metabolism of Leishmania armastigotes by
reducing the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphos-
phate (GTP) in susceptible organisms.

Spinosad ± Milbemycin Oxime
Trade/brand name: Comfortis (US, CA. UK). Trifexis? (US, CA, UK) (Rx)
Classification: Antiparasitic (pediculicide)
INDICATION
Dogs: Approved for the prevention and treatment of flea infestations on dogs
14 weeks of age and older. A formulation containing milbemycin oxime (rifexis)
 is also labeled for prevention of heartworrn disease and treatrment and control of
intestinal parasite infections (hookworms, roundworms, and whipworms)
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Spinosad should not be used concomitantly with high extra-label doses of
ivermectin, typically used to treat canine demodex mange. Signs of ivermectin
toxicity such as mydriasis, salivation, ataxia, lethargy and seizures have been
reported in this circumstance. Use cautiously in breeding females, and in dogs
with pre-existing seizures. Avoid use in puppies less than 14 weeks of age or less
than 2.3kg (5lb) body weight. Regarding Frifexis9, do not use without up-to
date negative heartworm test, or in patients with heartworrn disease.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Spinosad stimulates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in insects, causing
activation of motor neurons resulting in involuntary muscle contractions and
tremors. Long-lasting hyperexcitation will ultimately cause prostration, paralysis,
and death of the flea. It also binds secondarily to GABA sites and consequently
 may potentiate the nervous system dysfunction. Spinosad was dermonstrated by
the manufacturer (in a controlled laboratory study) to kill adult fleas within 30
 minutes after adrninistration, and to show 100% effectiveness within 4 hours.
DOSAGES

MECHANISM GF ACTIGN
SPL is a bacteriologically sterile staphylococcal vaccine containing the compo-
ingredients (sodiurm chloride and ultrafiltered beef heart infusion broth). It has
been shown to stirmulate T and B lyrmphocytes in vitro and to enhance the capa-
bility of macrophages to kill staphylococci
DOSAGES
Dogs: Start with 0.5mL SC twice weekly for a 10-14 week trial. If significaint
 improvement is noted, 0.5-1 mL can be administered once weekly to once every
2-4 weeks depending on the individual patient. In most cases improvement is
noted within 8-10 weeks
If using in highly allergic dogs: the manufacturer recommends first performing a
hypersensitivity to the product, and starting with 0.2 mL per week followed by
weekly increments of 0.2 mL until reaching 1.O mL
Note: This treatment will not resolve an existing bacterial infection; therefore.
antibiotic therapy has to be instituted if a bacterial infection is present. After the
infection is cleared the antibiotic is discontinued and the Staphage Lysate ther-
apy begins or continues. SPL does not contain any preservatives, and therefore it
must be handled aseptically. SPL should be stored in the refnigerator, and the
entire content should be used when the vial is opened

Sulfadiazine/Sulfamethoxazole+Trimethoprim
Trade/brand name: Fribrissen? (US. UK),. Bactrim? (US). Proloprim? (US)
Septra (US). Duphatrim (UK), generic
Classification: Antibacterial (potentiated sulfonamide)
IN DICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Approved to treat canine bacterial skin infections caused by
su5ceptible staphylococcal strains, but it can also be used to treat feline bacterial
skin infections. Potentiated sulfas have a broad antibacterial spectrum against
common Grar-positive (e.g., Staphylococcus, most Streptococci, Nocardia) and
Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. many organisms of the Enterobacteriaceae family).
It is the drug of choice for the initial treatment of nocardiosis, and it can also be
used to manage rapidly growing mycobacterial infections (reported susceptibility
57.1%). including atypical mycobacteriosis in dogs and cats caused by
Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. fortuitum, and M. cheronai.
Note: Bacterial culture and sensitivity should ideally be performed prior to
starting therapy.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
 Animals hypersensitive to sulfonarmides, and those with severe liver parenchymal
damage or blood dyscrasias. Animals with low Schirmer's tear test values should
not be treated with sulfonamides. Doberman pinschers, samoyeds, and minia-
ture schnauzers have been reported to have a higher risk to develop reactions to
sulfonamides, and these drugs should only be used in these breeds if the bene-
fits outweigh the risks. It was suggested that the predisposition of Doberman
pinscher to sulphonamides' idiosyncratic toxicity may be due to a limmited capac-
ity to detoxify the hydroxylarmine metabolites of sulfonamides.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Potentiated sulfas are bactericidal and sequentially inhibit the enzymes involved
in the folic acid pathway resulting in the inhibition of bacterial thymidine syn-
thesis. The sulfonamide inhibits the conversion of para-arminobenzoic acid
(PABA) to dihydrofolic acid, and trimethoprim inhibits the conversion of dihydro-
folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid by inhibiting the bacterial enzyme dihydrofolate
eductase

● Rapidly growing mycobacterial infections
0 Dogs: 15-30mg/kg PO q12h

Note: The concentration of trimethoprim falls below the therapeutic levels with
once-a-day administration at 30 mg/kg Po but the concentration of sulfadiazine
is maintained within the therapeutic range throughout the dosing interval.
Twice-a-day dosing at 1 5 mg/kg Po will maintain effective levels of both medica-
tions for longer periods of time, but peak concentrations of trimethoprim and
sulfadiazine will be lower and more likely to be bacteriostatic rather than bacte-
nicidal. For practical purposes: for organisms that are highly susceptible to sul-
fadiazine or to the combination (sulfadiazine+trimethoprim). use 30mg/kg
q24h Po; for organisms that are susceptible to the combination (sulfadia-
zine+trimethoprim) but not to sulfadiazine alone, use 15 mg/kg q12h; for infec-
tions where the susceptibility is not known, or for serious infections, use 30 mg/
kg q12h. The combination of sulfamethoxazole and trirmethoprim is approved
 for human use. There are no studies showing differences in the efficacy between

Terbinafine Hydrochloride
Trade/brand name: Lamisil (US, CA, UK), generic (Rx)
Classification: Antifungal
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Terbinafine is indicated for the treatment of dermatophytosis.
Malassezia dermatitis, aspergillosis, and sporotrichosis. Terbinafine has shown
in-vitro susceptibility against Candida, Coccioioides immitis, Histopiasma capsu-
fatum, Bastomyces dermatitiois, and Phythium insidiosum organisms. A recent
pharmacokinetics study in dogs provided evidence supporting the use of oral
terbinafine for the treatment of deep dermatophytosis (Microsporum canis and
Trichophyton metagrophytes), blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, and
pea ot suewny ul pasn uaag sy augeuigal (l toz ie za jeyes) sisoswoipioo
select systemic mycoses in conjunction with other antifungal agents; however,
reports of efficacy are limited.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Patients with known hypersensitive to the drug. Use very carefully (reduced
 dose) or do not use at all in patients with renal failure and chronic or active liver
disease.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal agent that inhibits the fungal squalene
epoxide, which is then converted to lanosterol and ergosterol. The resultant
depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane and the intracellular
accumulation of squalene are believed to be responsible for the fungicidal effect
of terbinafine. It is highly keratinophilic and lipophilic, and high dnug concentra-
tions are found in the stratum cormeum, hair, nails, sebum, and subcutaneous fat
of humans. After 14 days of therapy it has been shown to accumulate in cat hair
at or above the minimum inhibitory concentration (Mlc) for dermatophytes
DOSAGES
Dogs and cats
● Dermatophytosis: 30-40mg/kg PO q24h until 2-3 negative fungal culture5.
 For deep dermatophytosis in dogs, the most recently proposed dose interval is

Trade/brand name: Sumycin? (US). generic (US. CA, UK) (Rx)
Classification: Antibacterial (tetracycline), Anti-inflammatory
INDICATIONS
Dogs: In veterinary dermatology tetracycline has been used in conjunction with
niacinamide to treat various sterile inflammatory dermatoses such as discoid
upus erythematosus, sterile granulomatous/pyogranulomatous syndrome, ster-
le nodular panniculitis, cutaneous reactive histiocytosis, cutaneous vesicular
upus erythematosus, pemphigus erythematosus. pemphigus foliaceus, lupoid

cause discoloration of deciduous teeth. Use cautiously (reduce dose or avoid) in
patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency
MECHANISM OF ACTION
 The anti-inflarmmatory and immunomodulatory effects of tetracyclines are not
well understood, but it is believed to reduce chemotaxis of leukocytes in vivo and
lymphocyte blastogenesis in vitro, to inhibit complement (C3) activation, prosta-
glandin synthesis, and collagenase and lipase activities. The antimicrobial effect
is associated with the reversible binding of tetracycline to the 3oS ribosomal
subunit of susceptible bacteria and inhibition of protein synthesis by interfering
with the binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNA
DOSAGES
Dogs
● Sterile inflammatory dermatoses: 250 mg PO q8h for dogs ≤10kg and 500 mg
daily if clinical response is noted
Note: Clinical response may not be seen before 6-8 weeks of treatment. It is
used in combination with niacinamide (at the same dosage protocol)
Dogs and cats
● Staphylococcal pyoderma: 15-20mg/kg PO q8h
Note: Consider using tetracycline to treat staphylococcal pyoderma only if the
bacterial strain is proved to be susceptible to this antimicrobial. Recently. it has
been used in some cases of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal skin infections.
Response to therapy: however, is variable despite in-vitro susceptibility

MONItORING
● Efficacy and adverse effects
Thyrotropin
Trade/brand name: Thyrogen@ (US. UK) (Rx)
Classification: Hormone (thyroid)
IN DICATIONS
Dogs: Thyrotropin, or thyroid-stimulating homnone (TSH), is used to stimulate
thyroid gland secretion and assess its hormone reserve. For many years it was
used as the gold-standard test for diagnosing canine primary hypothyroidism
because it has been shown to more accurately differentiate primary hypothyroid-
sm from euthyroid sick syndrome. The bovine and recombinant human TSH
(rhTSH) have been shown to adequately stimulate the canine and feline thyroid
gands, but currently these hormones are either difficult to acquire (bovine TSH)
or very expensive (rhTSH).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Repeated administration of the pharmaceutical-grade bovine TSH may cause
anaphylactic reaction.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Thyrotropin increases iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, increasing the produc-
tion of thyroid horrmones. It also increases the hormones' release by inducing
proteolysis of the thyroglobulin molecule in phagolysosomes.
DOSAGES
Dogs
● Bovine-TSH: collect a pre-TSH blood sample then administer O.1 IU/kg IV (max-
inmum 5IU) of bovine TSH, then collect a 6-hour post-TSH blood sample.
Measure pre- and post-TSH serum T4 concentrations
202
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
● hTSH: collect a pre-TSH blood sample then administer 50-150mcg IV of
that 150mcg IV was better than 75mcg IV to differentiate hypothyroid dog5
from dogs with euthyroid sick sydrome (Boretti et af. 2o09); therefore, the
authors recommend using the higher dose in sick dogs or in dogs receiving
medications when the test cannot be delayed. Measure pre- and post-TSH
serum T4 concentrations
Note: The manufacturer recommends disposing of any leftover dose after
reconstitution. However, rhTSH stability has been shown to be preserved for
8 weeks if aliquots are frozen (-20°C), or for 4 weeks if refrigerated (4°C)

MONITORING
● Adverse effects
Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone
Trade/brand name: Thypinone? (US). Protirelin? (UK)
Classification: Hormone (thyroid)
INDICATIONS
Dogs: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is used to assess pituitary and thy-
roid gland function. In theory. this test could be used to differentiate primary
from secondary hypothyroidism. It is not, however, a reliable test to diagnose
primary hypothyroidism because there is typically minimal increase in serum T4
 concentration after TRH adrministration, which may result in normal dogs having
 post-TRH serum T4 values in the hypothyroid range.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
No infommation available.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
TRH directly stimulates TSH secretion by the pituitary gland and indirectly (via TSH)
stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland
Section 1: Systemic Drugs

DOSAGES
Dogs
● Collect a pre-TRH blood sample; administer O. 1 mg/kg IV of TRH; collect a 6-hour
post-TRH blood sample. Measure pre- and post-TRH senum T4 concentrations
● Collect a pre-TRH blood sample; administer 0.2mg (200 mcg) per dog IV of
TRH; collect a 4-hour post-TRH blood sample. Measure pre- and post-TRH

Ticarcillin Disodium +Clavulanate Potassium
Trade/brand name: Timentin? (US. CA, UK) (Rx)
Classification: Antibacterial (beta-lactam)
Ticarcillin disodium +clavulanate potassium is equivalent to ticarcillin disodium +
davulanic acid.
IN DICATIONS
Dogs: Otitis externa and/or media caused by susceptible Gram-negative bacte-
nia, especially Pseudomonas.
Cats: Treatment of otitis externa/media with ticarcillin has not been reported.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Patients with known hypersensitivity to penicillins or other beta-lactam antibi-
 otic. Use carefully in patients with renal failure.
204  Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Ticarcillin is a bactericidal beta-lactarn antibiotic that binds penicillin-binding proteins
involved in cell wall synthesis, resulting in cell wall weakness and inhibition of bacte-
nal growth, division, and septum formation. lt acts in a time-dependent manner
requiring drug concentrations above minimum inhibitory concentration (MilC) values
during administration intervals. The addition of clavulanate potassium or clavulanic
acid increases the drug spectrum of activity by inhibiting bacterial beta-lactarmase.
However, clavulanate does not enhance the ticarcillin activity against Pseucfomonas.
DOSAGES

● Pseudomonas otitis media: 15-25mg/kg IV q8h. This dose was based on a
study of dogs with Aseudomonas otitis resistant to fluoroquinolones and ami-
noglycosides (Nuttall 1998). Only cases with ruptured tympanic membranes
were treated with intravenous ticarcillin therapy
Note: For topical use of ticarcillin for treatment of Pseucomonas otitis exterma/
media, please refer to the topical monograph in Section 2.
Cats: Treatment of feline otitis externa/media with ticarcillin has not been reported;
nevertheless, the same dose protocol described for dogs can be used in cats

SIDE EFFECTS
Note: High doses of ticarcillin have been reported to cause decreased platelet
function and CNs signs (e.g. seizures) in human5.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Aminoglycosides: penicillins and arninoglycosides have synergistic or additive
effect in vitro against certain bacteria. Beta-lactam antibiotics can inactivate ami-
noglycosides when used in very high doses or in patients with renal failure:
therefore, do not mix these two antibiotic casses in the same syringe or vial
Probenecid: can reduce the renal elimination of ticarcillin
Warfarin: use carefully in patients receiving anticoagulants, as bleeding disor-
ders have been rarely reported with ticarcillin

Triamcinolone Acetonide
Trade/brand name: Corta/one? (US), generic (Rx)
(irmmunosuppressive), Hormone
INDICATIONS
Dogs and cats: Allergic skin disorders, autoimmune skin disorders, and variou5
 Sterile inflammatory or immune-mediated dermatoses.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Infectious diseases, hyperadrenocorticism (can be carefully used to balance
treatment-induced hypoadrenocorticism), gastnic ulcer, cormeal ulcer, diabetes
mellitus, renal failure, and pregnancy. Modified live vaccines should be avoided
when using immunosuppressive doses of glucocorticoids. Use glucocorticoids
cautiously in cats with any cardiovascular disorders that alter the compensatory
mechanisms for increased plasma volume, to avoid congestive heart failure
(Ployngam et ar. 2oo6). Triamcinolone will interfere with intradermal and allergy
serum test reactivity. vvithdrawal of oral administration of this drug is usually
recommendedfor atleast 4 weeks prior to allergy testing. Injectable triamcinolone
 is considered unsuitable for managerment of chronic dermatologic diseases due
to potential severe effect on the HPA-axis
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Triamcinolone is classified as an intermediate-acting glucocorticoid. There is dis-
crepancy in the veterinary literature regarding the relative potency of triamci-
nolone. Many human references report the anti-inflammatory potency of
triarmcinolone as being sirmilar to that of methylprednisolone (i.e., about 5 time5
the potency of cortisol or hydrocortisone and 1.25 times that of prednisolone)
However, most dermatologists believe that it is about 5-10 times more potent
than prednisolone, or as potent as dexamethasone. The mechanisms of action of
glucocorticoids are complex: through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms
they exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects by decreasing
the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. chemokines, adhesion molecules,
prostaglandins and leukotrienes (both mediated by increasing the expression of
Section 1: Systemic Drugs 207
[pocortin-1): enhancing the clearance of foreign antigens; decreasing the ability
of dendritic cells to present antigen and activate T cells; and suppressing the cel-
ular immune response through inhibition of IL-12 synthesis and suppression of
a Th-1 response, although they prormote a Th-2 response.

capsules. These doses comespond to 2.2-6.7 mg/kg PO q24h
Note:A recent prospective study showed that starting treatment at 0.2 1-1. 1 mg/
recommended dose (Feldman 201 1). Slow adjustment of the treatment protocol
to achieve clinical improvement may be needed on a case-by-case basis. Three-
quarters of the dogs in the study (35/47) never required >3 mg/kg/day to control
twice-daily administration appears to be more appropriate than once-a-day dos-
ng. because the effect of trilostane has been shown to last less than 12 hours.
Cats: 30mg per cat PO q12-24h. Start with once-a-day administration and
increase to twice daily if clinical signs do not improve. Follow the same protocol
for ACTH testing and dose adjustments as for dogs
Note: Very few cats with hyperadrenocorticism have been treated with trilos-
tane, with variable results

● Efficacy and adverse effects
● Perform an ACTH stimulation test 2-4 hours post-trilostane administration at
Aue pe io sep 0e pue og ie lanjeanaun 'pue Adeiaun bueui ianje sep tl-0l
tirme if the animal shows clinical signs of glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid
deficiency or recurrence of disease. Another recommendation is to perform
ACTH stimulation tests monthly for the first 3 months, then every 3 months for
the first year and then every 46 months thereafter. Adjust the dose accord-
ingly (reduce or increase by 25-50%) with the goal of maintaining the post-
ACTH cortisol levels between 2 and 4mcg/dL (55.18 and 110.36nmol/L)
Note: A recent study suggests that baseline cortisol concentration measured 4-6
 hours post trilostane adrninistration can be used to monitor response to therapy
in cases where money or inconvenience is a concerm for the client (Cook and
Bond 2010). Based on their findings, a healthy patient with baseline cortisol con-
centration between 1.3 mcg/dL and 2.9 mcg/dL (or ≤50% of pre-treatment value)
has adequate adrenal gland function; however, patients with values outside this
range would need an ACTH stimulation test to better evaluate the adrenal status
Further studies; however, are needed before replacing the ACTH stimulation test
with the baseline cortisol test to monitor response to trilostane therapy.
● Serur electrolytes (mostly sodium and potassium concentrations) should be
performed if lethargy. decreased appetite, vomiting and/or diarrhea develop

liver in the diet for a long period of time may result in hypervitarninosis A or
toxicity. Dosages as high as 10,0o0lU/kg/day may be needed to cause toxicity.
Avoid using topical and systemic formulations concurrently, to prevent toxicity.
MeCHaNISM OF ACTION
Vitarmin A is an alcohol, all-trans retinol that is oxidized in the body to retinal and
retinoic acid. These compounds play an important role in stimulating and main-
taining nomal growth and differentiation of keratinocytes through binding to
 specific nuclear receptors and altering gene transcription of various molecules
such as proteins, inflammatory mediators, and growth factors. All retinoids have
some antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory. and immunomodulatory effects
DOSAGES
Note: Reported doses are variable and anecdotal.

Voriconazole
Trade/brand name: Vfend? (US, CA, UK) (Rx)
Classification: Antifungal (second-generation azole, triazole)
INDICATIONS
Voriconazole is mainly recommended as primary or salvage therapy in infections
causedby Aspergillus.Scedosporium apiospermum (asexual formof
Peudallescheria boydi). Fusarium, and Candida in people. Voriconazole is also
effective against Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Trichosporon
species. Although it has very good efficacy against the majority of molds, the
exception is zygomycetes. It penetrates the CNS barrier and eye.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Patients with known hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients. Use
cautiously in patients with liver disease and in pregnant animals. The intravenous
formulation should be avoided in individuals with renal failure because the
solubilizing agent (cyclodextrin) can accumulate in the body.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
voriconazole is a second-generation triazole antifungal similar in stnucture to
fuconazole. The primary mechanism of action of voriconazole is the inhibition of
fungal cytochrome P450-dependent 14-alpha-lanosterol demethylase, which is
essential for the synthesis of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall. It also inhibits
24-methylene dehydrolanosterol demethylation in molds, explaining its good
activity against these fungi
DOSAGES
These doses are extrapolated frorm humans.
Dogs: 6mg/kg PO or IV q12h for the first 2 days (loading dose); thereafter
3-4 mg/kg PO q12h as needed (maintenance dose)
FORMULATIONS
Veterinary-labeled products: None

SIDE EFFECTS
Adverse effects in veterinary patients are unknown at this time because of
Imited use of this drug. In humans, reported side effects include dose-related

photosensitization, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare), other dermatologic reac-
tions, photophobia, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting. diarhea, increased
liver enzymes activity and rarely hepatotoxicity (jaundice, abnormal liver function
tests), anaphylaxis with intravenous administration. Rarely anemia, leukopenia
thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, QT interval prolongation, and nephrotoxicity.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Voriconazole is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme5
CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. It has highest affinity for CYP2C19, followed
by CYP2C9, and has significantly lower affinity for CYP3A4. Inducers or inhibitors
of these three enzymes may decrease or increase voriconazole plasma
concentrations.
Astemizole (CYP3A4 substrate): may increase plasma concentrations of
astemizole, resulting in serious cardiac arrhythmias if these drugs are used con-
currently
Benzodiazepines (CYP3A4 substrate): may increase benzodiazepine levels
Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, diltiazem, verapamil): serum
concentrations of these drugs may be increased
Carbamazepine and long-acting barbiturates such as phenobarbital and
mephobarbital (potent CYP inducers): these drugs may reduce serum
concentrations of voriconazole
Cisapride (CYP3A4 substrate): may increase plasma concentrations of
cisapride, resulting in serious cardiac arrhythmias
Corticosteroids: may increase AUC (area under the curve) for prednisolone
Cyclosporine (CYP3A4 substrate): increased serum concentration of
cyclosporine; cyclosporine dose should be decreased
serum concentration of voriconazole, and voriconazole can increase serum
concentration of phenytoin
or proton-pump inhibitors may be increased
Quinidine (CYP3A4 substrate): may increase plasma concentrations of
quinidine, resulting in serious cardiac arrhythmias
concentration of voriconazole
Sulfonylureas (CYP2C9 substrates: e.g.. tolbutamide. glipizide, and
glyburide): serum concentration of these drugs may be increased, with
increased risk for hypoglycemia
Terfenadine (CYP3A4 substrate): may increase plasma concentrations of
terfenadine resulting in serious cardiac arrhythmias
Vincristine, vinblastine (CYP3A4 substrates): may increase serum
concentrations of vinca alkaloids
Warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate): warfarin effects may be potentiated

IN DICATIONS
Dogs: Zinc-responsive derrmatosis of malarnutes and Siberian huskies (rarely
other breeds) fed balanced diets (syndrome l) or young rapidly growing puppies
fed diets low in zinc or high in phytates (e.g. cereal grains, soy-based or corm-
based diets), or supplemented with high levels of minerals (e.g.. calcium, iron,
copper) that may bind zinc and interfere with its intestinal absonption (syndrome Il)
t can also be used as adjunctive therapy for superficial necrolytic dermatitis
(metabolic epidermal necrosis, hepatocutaneous syndrome)
Cats: Superficial necrolytic dermatitis.
CONTRAINDICATIGNS
Patients sensitive to zinc.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Znc is an integral part of over 2oo metalloenzymes, and it is necessary for cell
membrane, protein and nucleic acid syntheses, wound healing. cell division and
growth, normal vision, taste acuity, sexual maturation and reproduction, and
immune response
DOSAGES

●Zinc-responsive dermatosis and superficial necrolytic dermatitis: 2mg/kg PO
q24h of elemental zinc; 5mg/kg P0 q24h of zinc gluconate; 10mg/kg PO
q24h or divided q12h of zinc sulfate
Note: Doses may need to be adjusted based on response to therapy. The
addition of low-dose glucocorticoid therapy may benefit cases that do not
lespond solely to zinc supplementation. The authors typically start with 0.5-
1.0mg/kg/day of oral prednisone or prednisolone and reduce the dose to the
bwest every-other-day dose required to maintain the disease under control
(ideally ≤0.2mg/kg once every other day). For syndrome I cases that do not
lespond to oral zinc supplementation and low-dose glucocorticoid therapy, slow
V or IM injections with sterile zinc sulfate solutions at 10-15mg/kg weekly
(maximum of 6oomg/month) for at least 1 month have been recommended.

Aluminum Acetate Solution (Burow's Solution
Or Modified Burow's Solution]
For otic use, refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Burow's solution can be used for adjunctive treatment of minor skin irritations
such as insect-bite reactions, and localized inflamed and exudative skin condi-
tions including acute moist dermatitis, intertrigo and contact dermatitis. It can
aso be used for the treatment of otitis externa (see Otic section).
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Burow's solution has astringent and acidifying properties and also has mild
soothing. antipruritic, and antiseptic/antimicrobial effects. The pharmaceutical
properties of the solution are not fully understood. All veterinary products con-
taining Burrow's solution also contain hydrocortisone, which adds antipruritic
and anti-inflarmmatory effects.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Burow's solution (alone) is usually used topically as a wet compress, dressing, or
area is air-dried between applications. Use can be as often as necessary. but
every 4-6 hours is often ermployed. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated
areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow
the medication to work. The duration of administration depends on the condi-
tion being treated and the response to the medication. The veterinary-labeled
products containing hydrocortisone can be directly applied. As Burow's solution

PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Do not use plastic or any occlusive dressing material to prevent evaporation. Use
room-temperature water for dissolving and application. Soap reduces the astrin-
gent actions of aluminum acetate. Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should wash
hands after application or wear gloves when applying. May cause dry skin and
skin imitation in some patients. The long-term use of products containing gluco-
corticoids can cause skin atrophy and potentially iatrogenic Cushing's disease
For products containing hydrocortisone, at least a Z-week withdrawal period is
 recomrended prior to intradermal or allergy serum testing.

Colloidal Oatmeal
INDICATIONS
Colloidal oatmeal provides temporary relief and soothing effect for itching and
pain associated with allergic reactions.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
 Colloidal oatmeal is used topically as an anti-inflammatory and antipruritic, but
the exact mechanism for this effect is not known. It is thought that as the con-
centration of oatrmeal increases, both its drying and antipruritic effects increase.
It has been suggested that it may inhibit prostaglandin synthesis.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
If using spray: up to 2-3 times a day as needed for itching relief. Do not let the
animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application,
to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. If shampoo or conditioner:
daily to weekly baths/after baths according to the veterinarian's recommenda-
tions. It is important to leave medicated shampoos in contact with the skin for at
last 10 minutes prior to rinsing well. Refer to product label for details of indi-
vidual use.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Other than the potential for increased drying of already dry skin, colloidal oat-
meal is very safe. In humans, there are some reports of contact dermatitis associ-
ated with its use.

HUMAN-LABELED COLLOIDAL OATMEAL TOPICAL PRODUCTS
There are several human products available containing colloidal oatmeal, includ-
ing creams, lotions and products to be added to the bath. Common trade names
include Aveeno°, Geri SS?, and Oatmeal Bath?
Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride
For systemic use, refer to Section 1: Systemic Drugs.
INDICATIONS
Provides temporary relief of itching and pain associated with allergic reactions.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (HCl), a first-generation antihistamine, is an
H,-receptor antagonist with anti-allergic properties inhibiting histamine-induced
wheal and flare responses. It has some local anesthetic activity, which probably
 relates to its main antipruritic mechanism of action. Diphenhydramine may be
absorbed in small amounts transdermally. but should not cause systemic side
effects.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
If using spray, lotion, gel, or cream: 1-3 times a day or as needed. Do not let the
animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application,
to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. If shampoo or conditioner:
daily to weekly baths/after baths according to the veterinarian's recommenda-
tions. It is important to leave medicated sharmpoos in contact with the skin for at
least 10 minutes prior to rinsing well
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes or mucous membranes. Do not apply to blistered or
draining/oozing areas of skin. At least 2-week withdrawal period is recom-
 mended prior to intrademmal testing.

Lidocaine ± Prilocaine
INDICATIONS
Lidocaine is used topically as an anesthetic or antioruritic and is included in sev-
eral products labeled for acute moist dermatitis and prunitic lesions. It can be
used for terporary relief of pain from minor cuts, abrasions, minor bumms, sun-
burns, insect bites/reactions, and irritant or contact dermatitis. Vvhen combined
with prilocaine (commonly called EMLA cream), it may be useful for dermal anes-
thesia prior to invasive procedures (e.g. prior to wound debridement, catheter
pacement, etc.).
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Lidocaine exerts its anesthetic properties via alteration of cell membrane ion
permeability, thereby inhibiting conduction from sensory nerves.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
A thin layer applied to affected areas every 3-4 hours or as needed for pain and/
Or pruritus. A thin layer applied prior to wound debridement and catheter
leplacement. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least
20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication
to work. For veterinary-labeled products, refer to product label for details on
individual use.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Side effects are related to amount and duration of use. Topical lidocaine may be
absorbed systemically. but systemic toxicity is unlikely to occur unless it is used
on a large body surface area, for prolonged periods of time, or at high concen-
trations. Be extra-vigilant in patients also receiving other class I antiarrhythmics
(e.g.. mexiletine or tocainide). Avoid contact with eyes and do not use in ears,
unless specifically labeled for such. Clients should wash hands after application

IN DICATIONS
Can be used alone for mild itching or as an adjunctive treatment to provide
soothing of more pruritic conditions, mild bacterial infections, or dry skin. It can
be used for insect-bite reactions, acute moist dermatitis, acral lick dermatitis,
fold dermatitis (intertrigo), feline acne, and post-surgery wounds
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Zinc plays a role in wound healing
including extracellular matrix remodeling, connective tissue repair, inflammation,
and cell proliferation. Zinc also has antiseptic and astringent properties.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
 May be applied to affected areas two times a day or as needed to relieve itching
and soothe the skin. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at
east 20-30 minutes after application, to allow the medication to work. For vet-
erinary-labeled products, refer to product label for details on individual use
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
 Overall it appears to be safe. Not to be used in patients with known sensitivity or
allergy to the ingredients. Avoid contact with eyes.

Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
Pramoxine Hydrochloride
INDICATIONS
 Provides temporary relief of itching and pain associated with allergic reactions.
It has been specifically shown to be useful as an adjunctive therapy for pruritus
in dogs with atopic dermatitis. Pramoxine hydrochloride (HCl) is often combined
with other topicals to help reduce pain and/or itching.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Pramoxine is a surface and local anes-
thetic to peripheral nerves shown to decrease nerve membrane permeability to
sodium, inhibiting depolarization, and to antagonize histamine-mediated pnuritus;
it is not related structurally to procaine-type anesthetics. Prarmoxine has antipruritic
effects that appear to be from a mechanism other than its anesthetic effect. Peak
local anesthetic effects occur within 3-5 minutes of application. Duration of action
is short, and it becomes even less when used frequently and repetitively
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
If using spray. lotion, gel, or cream: apply every 3-4 hours or as needed for
itching/pain relief. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least
20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to
work. If shampoo or rinse: daily to weekly baths/after baths or according to the
veterinarian's recommendations. It is important to leave medicated shampoos in
contact with the skin for at least 10 minutes prior to rinsing well. For veterinary-
labeled products, refer to product label for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes: pramoxine is too irritating for ophthalmic use.
Depending on product labeling. clients should wash hands after application or
wear gloves when applying. Adverse effects are unlikely, but localized derrmatitis
is possible. Due to its antagonizing effect on histamine-mediated pruritus, at
least a 2-week withdrawal period prior to intradermal test is recommended

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS
CORTICOSTEROIDS
There are at least 20 cherical entities (plus a variety of salts) used in hurmans for
topical corticosteroid therapy. The following section includes many veterinary
topical products and some human products that may be of use in veterinary
medicine.
Betamethasone
For systemic use, refer to Section 1: Systemic Drugs.
For otic use, refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Considered a high-potency topical corticosteroid, betamethasone may be useful
for adjunctive treatrment of localized pruritic and/or inflarmrmatory conditions that
may be associated with bacterial and/or yeast skin infections (betamethasone
and antimicrobial combination products). Because risks associated with beta-
methasone (e.g.. hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, systemic
corticosteroid effects, skin atrophy) are greater than with hydrocortisone, beta-
methasone products are generally reserved for more severe localized pruritic
conditions or when hydrocortisone is not effective. All veterinary-labeled prod-
mazole. The products containing bethametasone, gentamicin, and clotrimazole
are labeled for otic use; however, they can also be used extra-label for yeast and/
or bactenial skin infections sensitive to clotrimazole and gentamicin, when an
anti-inflammatory effect is also needed. Sole-ingredient betamethasone topical
forms are available with hurman labeling.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Corticosteroids are non-specific anti-inflammatory agents. Amongst their vari-
ous mechanisms of action, corticosteroids induce annexin I (i.e., phospholipase
A2-alpha inhibitory protein) in cells, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic
acid and its subsequent conversion to eicosanoids (i.e., leukotnenes, prostaglan-
dins, prostacyclins, and thrormboxanes). They also inhibit the synthesis of various
nflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF-alpha) by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory
transcription factor, NF-kB. Moreover, corticosteroids reduce DNA synthesis via
an antimitotic effect on epidermal cells. Topically applied corticosteroids also
inhibit the migration of leukocytes and macrophages to the area, reducing ery-
thema, pruritus, and edema.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
hitially. topical corticosteroids are usually used sparingly 1-2 times per day, then
tapered to less frequent use. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas
for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the
medication to work. Bethametasone fommulations are best suited for focal
(e.g.. pedal) or multifocal lesions and for relatively short durations. However,
dinicians must tailor the frequency and duration of application to the severity of
dinical signs, being always mindful of the potential side effects associated with
232
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
frequent and prolonged use. For veterinary products, refer to individual product
labeling for specific dosing and frequency recormmendations.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Several veterinary topical products list tuberculosis of the skin and pregnancy a5
a contraindication. Use care when treating large areas, or when using on smaller
patients. Increased risks of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, sys-
temic corticosteroid effects (e.g.. polydipsia/polyuria, Cushing's disease, gastro-
intestinal signs). cutaneous atrophy that can be associated with skin fragility.
superficial follicular cysts (milia), and comedones may occur as product concen-
tration and duration of treatment increase. Local skin reactions (burming, itching.
redness) are possible but unlikely. Betamethasone may delay wound healing.
particularly if used for longer than 7 days. Vomiting and diamhea have been
reported with the use of products containinq betamethasone. Risks can be
reduced by treating for only as long as necessary on as smmall an area as possible.
Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should wash hands after application or wear
gloves when applying. At least a 2-week withdrawal period is recommended

INDICATIONS
Considered a low-potency topical corticosteroid, hydrocortisone may be useful
for adjunctive treatment of localized prunitic and/or inflammatory conditions
Because risks associated with hydrocortisone are significantly less when compared
 to higher-potency corticosteroids, hydrocortisone is a reasonable first choice, par-
ticularly when treating large areas, or when using on smaller patients. Some prod-
ucts also contain other ingredients, which may have additional antiprunitic effects.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Corticosteroids are non-specific anti-inflammatory agents. Amongst their vari-
ous mechanisms of action, corticosteroids induce annexin I (i.e. phospholipase
A2-alpha inhibitory protein) in cells, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic
acid and its subsequent conversion to eicosanoids (i.e., leukotrienes, prosta-
glandins. prostacyclins, and thromboxanes). They also inhibit the synthesis of
various inflammatory cytokines (e.g.. IL-1, TNF-alpha) by inhibiting the pro-
DNA synthesis via an antimitotic effect on epidermal cells. Topically applied

corticosteroids also inhibit the migration of leukocytes and macrophages to the
area, reducing erythema, pruritus, and edema.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES

tapered to less frequent use. Do not allow the animal to lick or chew at treated
gites for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to prevent ingestion and allow
the medication to work. Hydrocortisone formulations are best suited for focal
(e.g.. pedal) or multifocal lesions and for relatively short durations. However,

Hydrocortisone aceponate
Hydrocortisone aceponate is not currently availabie in the Us. it is avaiiable
in EU.
For otic use, refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Hydrocortisone aceponate (HCA) is labeled for symptomatic treatment of various
 inflammatory and/or pruritic dermatoses in dogs. A pilot study showed that HCA
may be a good treatment option for pedal dermatitis in atopic dogs (Bryden
et al. 2008). Moreover, a placebo-controlled study showed that HCA was an
effective treatment for canine atopic dermatitis, with clinical response occurring
within 14-28 days (Nuttall et ar. 2009). Another recent randomized single-
blinded controlled study showed that HCA spray and oral cyclosporine were
equally effective for the treatment of canine atopic dermatitis for the 84-day
study duration (Nuttall et al. 201 1). A controlled clinical trial conducted in dogs
with experimentally induced flea-allergy demmatitis showed a potential benefit
for this condition (Bonneau et af. 2oo9). Anecdotal reports also suggest potential
benefit for canine pyotraumatic dermatitis.
More recently. a small open-label pilot study showed that HCA appears to be
effective (with significant improvement in clinical lesions and pruritus) and safe
for the management of presumed feline allergic dermatitis, including cases of
eosinophilic granuloma complex, although it is not licensed for use in cats
(Schmidt et al. 201 1)

Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
MECHANISM OF ACTIGN
HCA, a diester glucocorticoid, is a pro-drug that is biotransformed in the epider-
mis to its active form, hydrocortisone-17-propionate. Diester glucocorticoids
-dns payew ing siseigoioy ewmap uo g-ll pue I-ll jo uoissaiddns gewuiw aaey
pression of epidermal IL-1. Diesters are also very lipophilic, so penetrate the sub-
cutaneous tissue well. In addition, it is metabolized entirely in the skin, and is not
absorbed into the systernic circulation, thus sparing the hypothalarmic-pituitary-
adrenal axis.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES

This dosage can be achieved with two pump sprays 10 crm away from the area to
be treated equivalent to a square of 10cm x 10cm (e.g.. palm-sized area of
skin). Total area treated should not exceed one-third of the body surface. No

consecutive days, but clinicians must tailor the frequency and duration of appli-
cation to the severity of clinical signs, being mindful of potential side effects.
A 70-day placebo-controlled study in canine atopic dermatitis showed that the
frequency of application necessary to maintain the disease under control varied
from daily (3/21 dogs). to every other day (7/21 dogs). or twice weekly (6/21
dogs) (Nuttall et af. 2009). Some of the dogs (5/21 dogs) received additional
therapy. The same study also showed that clinical signs may improve in 14 days.
but full clinical remission may be seen only around 28 days. Coat length did not
appear to influence the response to treatment. In a pilot study in cats with pre-
sumed allergic dermatitis, the cats received two sprays per 1oo cm? of affected
skin once daily for 28-42 days (Schmidt et al. 201 1). It wa5 possible to reduce
clinical improvement reported was evident in 14 days, but full clinical remission
occurred around 28 days.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Do not use on cutaneous ulcers. In the case of concurrent microbial disease or
parasitic infestation, the dog should receive appropriate treatment for such
conditions. HCA is reported to be well tolerated in doqs. Tolerance studies
using 3 and 5 times the recommended dosage for twice the recommended
treatment duration resulted in a reduced capacity for production of cortisol
that is fully reversible within 7-9 weeks after the end of treatment. Systemic
absorption appears to be negligible. A placebo-controlled study in canine
atopic dermatitis showed that HCA was safe when used once daily during the
70-day study duration, despite not being licensed for long-term treatment
(Nuttall et ar. 2oo9). One study showed no local cutaneous reactions or histo-
pathological changes with daily applications of HCA for over 2 months in
healthy beagle dogs (Rerme and Dufour 2010); however, another 5tudy in
atopic Maltese-beagle dogs showed a significant decrease in dermal thickness
at treated sites after 14 days of daily therapy (Bizikova et al. 2010). Care should
 be taken to avoid spraying into the eyes of the animal or the person applying
the product.

moist dermatitis, and anal sac inflammation/infection, and Neo-Predef w/
Tetracaine Powder? for acute otitis externa, acute moist dermatitis. and
interdigital dermatitis in dogs and cats
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Corticosteroids are non-specific anti-inflarmmatory agents. Amongst their various
mechanisms of action, corticosteroids induce annexin I (i.e., phospholipase
A2-alpha inhibitory protein) in cells, thereby, block the release of arachidonic
acid and its subsequent conversion to eicosanoids (i.e. leukotrienes,
prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and throrboxanes). They also inhibit the synthesis
of various inflammatory cytokines (e.g.. IL-1. TNF-alpha) by inhibiting the pro
inflammatory transcription factor, NF-kB. Moreover, corticosteroids reduce DNA
synthesis via an antimitotic effect on  epidermal cells. Topically applied
corticosteroids also inhibit the migration of leukocytes and macrophages to the
area, reducing erythema, pnuritus, and edema
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Labeled dose for rritop? when used on skin or mucous membranes surfaces is:
cleanse area, apply a small amount, and spread and rub in gently. Involved area
may be treated 1-3 times daily and continued in accordance with clinical
response. Labeled dose for Neo-Predef w/Tetracaine Powder® is: cleanse area,
apply by compressing bottle with short, sharp squeezes; once daily application
usually sufficient, but may use 1-3 times as required. It is important to closely
monitor for side effects that may develop when using glucocorticoid-containing
products frequently and for long periods of time. Do not allow the animal to lick
or chew at treated sites for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to prevent
 ingestion and allow the medication to work.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
Several veterinary topical products containing corticosteroids list tuberculosis of
the skin and pregnancy as a contraindication. Use care when treating large areas

Because the veterinary products contain polyethylene glycol, nephrotoxicity
may potentially develop if they are used on extensive areas associated with
eroded/ulcerated skin surfaces. Anecdotally, very rarely, renal toxicity has been
leported. Should use caution in conditions where absorption of large quantities
of polyethylene glycol is possible. especially if there is evidence of renal
impairment. Clients should wash hands after application or wear gloves when
applying. Avoid contact with eyes. At least a 2-week withdrawal period is

For systemic use, refer to Section 1: Systemic Drugs.
INDICATIONS
Essential fatty acids are indicated primarily as adjunctive therapy for pruritic and
inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis and sebaceous adenitis, and
keratinization disorders such as seborthea. They may also be used to improve

coat quality and ameliorate dry skin. Some of these products may contain other
active ingredients, including other natural oils.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The exact mechanism of action of essential fatty acids is not well known
However, by competing with arachidonic acid for the enzymes lipoxygenase
and cyclooxygenase, they decrease the synthesis of inflammatory leukotrienes
and prostaglandins in the body, thereby potentially reducing inflammation and
pruritus.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
If using spray: up to 2-3 applications a day or as needed. Do not let the animal
lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to
allow the medication to work. If spot-on: treatment may vary from weekly to
every 2 weeks or monthly. If shampoo or conditioner: daily to weekly baths/after
baths or according to the veterinarian's recommendations. It is important to
leave medicated shampoos in contact with the skin for at least 10 minutes prior
to rinsing well. Refer to product label for details on individual use.

HUMAN-LABElED ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS TOPICAL PRODUCTS
Several human OTC products containing essential fatty acids are available in the
US, but they may contain other ingredients and are generally not used in dogs
and cats.
Phytosphingosine Salicyloyl
For other products containing phytosphingosine combined with other
active ingredients, refer to other main active ingredients in Section 2.
INDICATIONS
Fhytosphingosine Douxo? Caim line is indicated for localized or generalized
inflammatory skin conditions that may be associated with pruritus, including
allerqic diseases such as atopic dermatitis. Douxo? Caim Ge/ is also indicated as
a liquid wound dressing for localized inflarnmation and after surgery (can be
sprayed on sutures)
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Fhytosphingosine salicyloy is a modified pro-ceramide with salicylic acid and a
key molecule in the natural defense mechanism of the skin. Ceramides comprise
40-5o% of the main lipids responsible for maintaining the cohesion of the
stratum corneum, the skin lipid barrier controlling local flora (antibacterial and
antifungal effects) and maintaining the correct moisture balance. It is also anti-
inflammatory as it has anti-iIL-1 activity impairs the production of prostaglandin
E, and inhibits protein kinase C

HUMAN-LABELED ACETIC ACID AND BORIC ACID TOPICAL
PRODUCTS
 There are several OTC human products available containing acetic acid and/or
 boric acid (alone or containing other ingredients). For more information on
human-labeled acetic acid or boric acid products, refer to a comprehensive
human drug reference (e.g., Facts and Comparisons or Micromedex) or contact
a pharmacist.

Bacitracin
INDICATIONS
 Bacitracin is labeled in hurmans for topical use to treat superficial skin infection5
Gaused by susceptible organisms, and to prevent infection after minor skin inju-
ies such as dermal lacerations, scrapes, or burns. However, the authors recom-
mend the use of bacitracin in dogs and cats only for confirmed local bacterial
skin infections, as bacterial resistance may occur if it is used to prevent infection
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic that acts by inhibiting cell wall synthesis of
susceptible bacteria, and it is either bactericidal or bacteniostatic depending on
drug concentration and bacterial susceptibility. It is active in low concentrations
against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphyiococcus and Streptococcus,
and some Gram-negative cocci, but Gram-negative bacilli are highly resistant.
Bacitracin activity is not impaired by blood, pus, necrotic tissue, or large inocula
Bacterial resistance has been described.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Bacitracin may be applied 1-3 times daily and covered by a suitable dressing if
needed. Use is usually not recommended for more than 1 week. Do not let the
to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
Bacitracin topical ointment labeled for skin should not be used in or around eyes.

eports of cats developing fatal anaphyactic reactions after administered oph-
thalmic "triple" antibiotic ointments. Deep puncture wounds, animal bites, or

administration generally results in negligible systemic levels, if used over large
areas of the body or on severe burms or puncture wounds, measurable absorp-
tion and potential toxicity may occur. Bacitracin is contraindicated for the treat-
ment of ulcerated lesions. Clients should wash hands after application or wear
goves when applying. Use caution when recommending bacitracin ermpirically.

Benzoyl Peroxide
INDICATIONS
Benzoyl peroxide products are used topically as either gels or shampoos.
Shampoos are generally used for oily and scaly skin (seborrhea oleosa), superfi-
cial and deep pyodermas, crusty pyodermas (such as seborrheic demmatitis/
pyoderma comronly seen in cocker spaniels), and as adjunctive therapy for
generalized demodicosis and schnauzer comedo syndrome. Gels may be useful
for treating localized superficial and deep pyodermas, fold pyodermas, chin
acne, and localized dermodectic lesions.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Benzoyl peroxide possesses antimicrobial (especially antibacterial), keratolytic,
comedolytic ("follicular flushing"). and degreasing actions. Benzoyl peroxide's
antimicrobial activity is due to the formation of oxidative benzoyl peroxy radicals
that disnupt cell membranes.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Gels are usually recommended for use once to twice daily, and shampoos once
daily to weekly according to the veterinarian's recormmendation. When using
 gel, it is inportant to not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least
20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to
work. It is important to leave the shampoo in contact with the skin for at least
10 minutes prior to rinsing well. For veterinary products, refer to product label
 for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes or mucous membranes. Clients should wash hands after
application or wear gloves when applying benzoyl peroxide, as it will bleach
colored fabrics, jewelry. clothing. or carpets and may bleach the patient's hair.
Clients should be advised to keep treated animals away from fabrics during
treatment. Benzoyl peroxide can be drying or irritating (causing erythema, pruri-
tus, pain) in some patients, particularly at higher (>5%) concentrations. Use of
emollients after bathing. using shampoos with moisturizing microvesicles, or
reducing the frequency of baths may alleviate or prevent this problem. Benzoyl
peroxide shampoos do not lather well.

HUMAN-LABELED BENZOYL PEROXIDE TOPICAL PRODUCTS
There are many human products available containing benzoyl peroxide (from
2.5% to 10% formulations). If using human products, avoid concentrations
higher than 3% for shampoos or 5% for gels, as risks for skin irritation may
increase. Benzoyl peroxide 5% gel can be labeled as either Rx or OTC depending
on product, and it is available as generics or with the trade names Benzac?
Desquam-X?, or PanOxy/@
Clindamycin
For systemic use, refer to Section 1: Systemic Drugs.
INDICATIONS
Topical clindarnycin may be used for the treatrment of feline acne or other local-
ized skin infections caused by bacteria susceptible to clindamycin. The only avail-
able veterinary-labeled product (ClinzGard?) is indicated for the treatment of
anal sac and tissue abscesses, puncture wounds, and surgical incisions. The
authors recommend using clindamycin when other topical antibiotics (such as
gentamicin) have failed and based on culture and sensitivity results, because of
the potential for rapid occurrence of bacterial resistance
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 5os ribosome.
Its primary activity is against anaerobic and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
W/hen used for feline acne, topical clindarnycin is generally applied in a thin film
 once daily however, the authors recommend twice-daily applications. ClinzGard@
is used as a single application that has sustained release over 7-10 days. Do not
let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after
application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. Must be
applied to cleaned and debrided (if necessary) suirfaces
Section 2: Topical Agents
261
PRECAUTIONS/ADＶERSE EFFECTS
Topical clindamycin should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensi-
tivity to clindamycin or lincomycin. Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should wash
hands after application or wear gloves when applying. Contact reactions (pain,
burming erythema, itching. drying, peeling) are possible. Clindamycin lotions and
gels may cause less burning than the topical solutions or foams. As clindamy-
dn can be absorbed through the skin, systemic adverse effects are possible.
Antibiotic-associated diarrheas are potentially possible, but severe, life-threaten-
ing diarrheas (so-called pseudomembranous colitis) are thought to occur very
larely in animal patients and only when clindarmycin is used systemically.

Fusidic Acid
This product is not currently avaiable in the US. r is avaiiable in EU and CA
INDICATIONS
Fusidic acid is labeled for the topical treatment of surface pyoderma in dogs such
as acute moist dermatitis and intertrigo (skin fold dermatitis), and it may also be
used for superficial pyoderma and resistant bacterial skin infections. Fusidic acid
is highly effective against Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, which plays a piv-
Otal role in surface and superficial pyoderma in dogs. Fuciderm@ contains beta-
methasone valerate in addition to fusidic acid, adding anti-inflammatory and
antiprunitic properties to the product.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that belongs to a group of its own, fusi-
danes, and exerts an antibacterial action by interfering with bacterial protein
synthesis. Fusidic acid exhibits in-vitro activity against most coagulase-positive
and coaqulase-neqative staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Conynebac-
terium species, and most Clostridium species. In addition, almost all strains of
methicillin-resistant Staphyiococcus aureus and S. pseuointermeoius demon-
strate in-vitro sensitivity to fusidic acid. Fusidic acid has the ability to penetrate
both intact and damaged skin.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Apply to affected area(s) twice daily for 5-7 days. It may be applied longer if
determined by the veterinanian. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated
areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow
the medication to work. For veterinary-labeled products, refer to individual
product labeling for specific dosing/frequency recommendations.
PRECAUTIONSADVＶERSE EFFECTS

For otic use, refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Gentamicin can be useful for treatinq bacterial skin infections caused by
organisms susceptible to gentamicin. Some commercial products also indicate
prophylactic use after lacerations/abrasions or after minor surgery. However, the

combination with the corticosteroid betamethasone to treat skin infections
where an anti-inflarmmatory or antipruritic effect is needed. It has activity against
many Streptococcus, Staphyiococcus (coagulase-negative/positive and some
penicillinase-producing  strains)  and  Gram-negative bactena incuding many
Klebsielia, Escherichia coli. and Pseudomonas (often becomes resistant to
gentamicin). All veterinary-labeled products are in combination with
bethametasone (or mometasone) and many are also in combination with
clotrimazole. The products containing bethametasone or mometasone and
clotrimazole are labeled for otic use; however, they can also be used extra-label
for bacterial and/or yeast skin infections sensitive to gentamicin and clotrimazole.
formulations containing gentamicin as the sole ingredient are available as
 veterinary ophthalmic solutions and with human labeling.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside with bactericidal activity. It binds to the bacterial
30S ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Topical gentamicin/betamethasone sprays are labeled for use 2-4 times daily for
O1 padde Ajeauab ane stuawnuio pue sweano upjweiuab jeoidol sAep / ot dn
affected areas 1-2 times daily. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas
for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the
medication to work. Creams are generally used for secondary or oily/exudative
 infections and ointrents for dry skin infections.
PRECAUTIGNS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
Topical gentamicin may be absorbed systemically if used on ulcerated, burned,
 or denuded skin. Systemic toxicity is unlikely to occur unless it is used on a large
body area or for prolonged periods of time. Creams are more likely to be
absorbed than ointments. Potential side effects associated with gentamicin
products include skin irritation, erythema, burning. and photosensitivity. It is
contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to gentamicin or its class
Prolonged use, or use over large areas with products also containing
corticosteroids (betamethasone or mometasone). may cause adrenal
suppression. Increased risks of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression,

with eyes. Clients should wash hands after application or wear qloves when
applying. Use caution when using these products empirically. because of
possible bacterial  resistance  to  gentamicin.  For products  containing
qucocorticoids, at least a 2-week withdrawal period is recommended prior to
 intradermal or allergy serur testing.

Mupirocin (Pseudomonic Acid)
For otic use, refer to the Otic section
INDICATIONS
Mupirocin is approved for treating skin infections in dogs (e.g.. superficial pyoderma,
fold pyoderma, interdigital cysts/draining tracts, acne, pressure point pyodermas)
Gaused by susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus or S. pseudintermedfius,
ncluding beta-lactamase-producing and methicillin-resistant strains. It may also be
used for feline acne cases complicated with staphylococcal infection.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Mupirocin is produced from Aseucomonas fuorescens, and it is chemically
unrelated to any other antibiotic. It exerts a bacteriostatic action (although the
high concentrations applied to the skin may be bactericidal) against sensitive
organisms by binding specifically to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase
and inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Despite its broad spectrum, its main
activity is mostly against Gram-positive cocci (Staphyiococcus and Streptococcus)
It also shows activity against other Gram-positive pathogens: Corynebacterium,
Costricdium, Proteus, and Actinomyces. Mupirocin also has activity against some
Gram-negative bacteria, but is not used clinically for infections caused by those
bacteria. Moreover, it has been reported to have little efficacy against Cancfidfa
and cats has been anecdotally reported. Pseudomonas species are particularly
lesistant to mupirocin. Wwhile bacterial resistance is rare, resistant strains of
Staphyiococcus aureus have been identified and resistance transference is
thought to be plasmid-mediated. It is thought that resistance occurs more fre-
quently when mupirocin is used over a prolonged period and over larger areas of
skin; therefore, it may be best to use mupirocin for short-temm treatment and on
small localized areas. Cross-resistance with other antirmicrobials has not been
identified. Mupirocin is not significantly absorbed into the systermic circulation,
but does penetrate well into granulomatous deep lesions. It is not suitable for
application to bumns.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Mupirocin is labeled for twice-daily application on dogs and 10 minutes contact
time to the skin is required in order to be active. Do not let the dog lick or chew at
affected areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and
allow the medication to work. In cats with chin acne, once- to twice-daily applica-
tions have been shown to be efficacious in treating the secondary infection
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
Mupirocin is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to
with eyes. Because the ointment has a polyethylene glycol base, the manufac-
urer warns that nephrotoxicity may potentially develop if it is used on extensive
deep lesions. Anecdotally, very rare cases of renal toxicity have been reported.

reported in humans include pain, itching. erythema, and dryness of the skin
Erythema has been reported in dogs. Overgrowth of non-susceptible organ-
isms (superinfection) is also possible with prolonged use. Despite low poten-
tial for bacterial resistance, overuse, rmostly over prolonged period of time,
should be avoided. Safety in pregnant or breeding animals has not been
determined.

Nitrofurazone
INDICATIONS
Nitrofurazone can be used for treating bacterial skin infections associated with
evidence demonstrating efficacy in the treatment of minor burns or bacterial
skin infections is apparently unavailable.
Section 2: Topical Agents
697
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Nitrofurazone is a nitrofuran antibacterial. It is bactericidal and thought to inhibit
bacterial enzymes that primarily degrade glucose and pyruvate.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Apply once to twice daily until lesions resolve or as directed by the veterinarian.
Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes
after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. For
veterinary products, refer to product label for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
The soluble dressing contains polyethylene glycol, and if it is used on large
areas of denuded skin significant amounts of polyethylene glycol could be
absorbed and cause nephrotoxicity. Avoid contact with eyes or mucous merm-
branes if product is not labeled for eyes. Clients should wash hands after
application or wear gloves when applying. Avoid exposure to sunlight, strong
fluorescent lighting. excessive heat, or alkaline materials. Topical nitrofurazone
appears to be well tolerated; however, hypersensitivity or skin reactions (pain,
erythema, itching) are possible, but thought to occur rarely. Overgrowth of
non-susceptible organisms (superinfection) is also possible with prolonged
use. There is some concern with potential carcinogenic effects, from previous
reports in rats.

Silver Sulfadiazine
INDICATIONS
Topical silver sulfadiazine (SSD) is labeled for prophylactic use and treatment of
wounds and second- and third-degree burms. However, the authors recommend
 its use only for confirmed cases of localized bacterial skin infections, to avoid
bacterial resistance. It is useful in treating localized pyodermas caused by
Pseudomonas or other susceptible bacteria
MECHANISM OF ACTION
SSD acts by disrupting microbial cell mermbranes and cell walls; this differs from
the antibacterial actions of silver nitrate or sodium sulfadiazine. SSD has exten-
sive antimicrobial activity and is bactericidal for yeast and many Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria. It enhances epithelialization but retards granulation
(avoid use in non-granulated wounds)
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
W/hen used for burns, SSD is applied once to twice daily at a thickness of approx-
imately 1/16 of an inch (1.5mm). Dressings may be applied over the cream.
WWhen used for wounds or localized pyodermas apply the cream once to twice
daily. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 min-
utes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
treatment must be weighed against the risks of not treating with SSD. Patients
with significant hepatic or renal dysfunction may accumulate drug. particularly
when used over large areas. Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should wash hands

after application or wear gloves when applying. Adverse effects associated with
sulfonamides (e.g., keratoconjunctivitis sicca in dogs, blood dyscrasias in dogs
and cats, etc.) are possible, particularly when used over large areas or for
extended periods.Refer to Sulfadiazine/Sulfamethoxazole+Trimethoprim in
Section I (Systemic Drugs) for more information.

Three Point Enzyme System
For otic use,refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Labeled for various types of bactenial and fungal skin infections and some specific
conditions such as impetigo, fold pyoderma, anal sac abscesses, pyotraumatic
dermatitis, and dermatophytosis. The manufacturer claims that it is effective
against Staphylococcus,Pseudomonas, Malassezia,Candida albicans, and
Microsporum. Can also be used alone for mild itching or as an adjunctive
treatment to provide soothing of more pruritic conditions such as atopic derma-
titis, especially if using products that also contain hydrocortisone.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The Three Point Enzyme System includes milk-derived enzymes such as lactoper-
oxidase, lysozyme, and lactoferrin that are reported to be effective against
272
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
bacterial, fungal, and viral microorganisms. Lactoperoxidase, when combined
with hydrogen peroxide, thiocyanate. and/or iodide. produces a potent
antibacterial system known as the lactoperoxidase system. The hypohalous ions
produced are either the hypothiocyanate ion or the hypoiodite ion. Both are
bactericidal substances. Hypoiodite is also a known fungicidal agent. The
antibacterial property of the lactoperoxidase system is based upon inhibition of
vital bacterial metabolic enzymes brought on by their oxidation by hypothiocy-
anate or hypoiodite. Lysozyme kills bacteria by disrupting the formation of a
of the bacterial cell wall. Lactoferrin is bacteriostatic against a wide range of
microorganisms  including  Gram-negative  (coliforms)  and  Gram-positive
(Staphyiococcus) bacteria. It has the potential to inhibit the growth of bacteria
 and kills the bacteria by depriving therm of iron, which is vital for growth.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
If using spray, crearn, or wipes: 1-2 times a day application. Do not let the animal
lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to
avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. If shampoo or rinse: daily to
weekly baths/after baths according to the veterinarian's recommendations. It is
important to leave the shampoo in contact with the skin for at least 10 minutes
 prior to rinsing well. Refer to product label for details on individual use.

ANTISEPTICAGENTS
Chlorhexidine Gluconate
IN DICATIONS
 Chlorhexidine, a topical antiseptic, is generally used as adjunctive therapy for
bacterial skin infections caused by Grarm-positive and Gram-negative bacteria,
with no predictable activity against Pseudomonas or Seratia. It may also be used
 25 adjunctive therapy for fungal skin diseases. Veterinary products are available
in many different forms (solutions, shampoos, scrubs, ointments, sprays, etc.).
Because it causes less drying and is usually less initating than benzoyl peroxide.
it is sometimes used in patients that cannot tolerate benzoyl peroxide. However,
it does not have the keratolytic, comedolytic, or degreasing effects of benzoyl
peroxide. Chlorhexidine possesses some residual effects and can remain active
274  Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
on skin after rinsing. Chlorhexidine products may also contain other ingredients
such as antifungals (ketoconazole and miconazole), salicylic acid, and phyto-
sphingosine.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Chlorhexidine is a phenol-related bisbiguanide. It is an important antiseptic,
disinfectant, and preservative. At usual concentrations, chlorhexidine acts by
 damaging bacterial cytoplasmic membranes. Antifungal activity can be obtained
with 2% or higher concentrations. Chlorhexidine has residual activity and works
in organic debris.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES

HUMAN-LAbELED CHLORHEXIDINE TOPICAL PRODUCTS
There are several topical skin cleansers available in the 2-4% range. Trade names
include: BactoShiela?, Betasept, Dyna-Hex?, Exidine, Hibiciens, and Hibistat@
Chloroxylenol (PcMX)
For otic use, refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Chloroxylenol is an antimicrobial disinfectant with demonstrated efficacy against
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, in addition to a wide variety of
fungal organisms, and against RNA and DNA viruses. Can be used in presurgical
preparation of skin, for cleaning wounds, and in the treatment of bacterial.
fungal, and yeast skin infections.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Chloroxylenol, also known as parachlorometoxylenol (PCMX), is a chlorinated
phenolytic antiseptic. Its antibacterial action is due to disruption of bacterial
cytoplasmic membranes blocking production of adenosine triphosphate.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
If using spray or wipes/pads: 1-2 times a day or according to patient's needs. Do
not let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after
application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. If using sham-
poo: daily to weekly baths according to the veterinarian's recommendations. It is
important to leave medicated shampoos in contact with the skin for at least 10
 minutes prior to rinsing well. Refer to product label for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIGNS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
 Overall safe for dogs and cats. May cause skin irritation.

HUMAN- LABELED CHLOROXYLENOL TOPICAL PRODUCTS
There are several topical products available containing chloroxylenol, usually
combined with other ingredients such as hydrocortisone, menthol, prarmoxine,
btions, and shampoos), but these are not commonly used in dogs and cats
Trade namesinclude Aurino/?, Calamycin?, Cortamox?, Cortane-B?, Dermacoat?
and Foile?, including some otic products as well.
Ethyl Lactate
INDICATIONS
hdicated for bacterial skin infections including surface and superficial pyoder-
 mas. It also has a keratoplastic effect that provides antiseborrheic activity.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
 Ethyl lactate is a very lipid-soluble compound that rapidly penetrates hair follicles
and sebaceous glands, where it is hydrolyzed by bacterial lipases into lactic acid
and ethanol, and the free lactic acid lowers the skin pH, thereby producing an
antibacterial activity. Ethanol makes fat soluble and lowers sebaceous secretions
It is not as active as benzoyl peroxide against staphylococcal organisms, but is
less irritating and drying.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Daily to weekly baths according to the patients needs. It is inportant to leave
medicated shampoos in contact with the skin for at least 10 minutes prior to
rinsing well. Refer to product label for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should wash hands after application or wear
goves when applying. Adverse effects are unlikely, but local effects (erythema,
pain, itching) are possible.

Hypochlorous Acid
For otic use, refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Hypochlorous acid is indicated for the management of wounds, abscesses, cuts,
abrasions, skin irritations, ulcers, post-surgical incision sites, and burns, as it can
accelerate the healing process. It may be used for prevention of bacterial skin
infections or as an adjunctive topical therapy for bacterial skin infections, includ-
ing methicillin-resistant Staphyococcus and Aseudomonas. Hypochlorous acid
also has antifungal and antiviral properties. Also reported to reduce inflarmma-
tion, pain and itching. Veterycin? is a proprietary formulation based upon the
Microcyn technology platformn.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Broad-spectrum  antimicrobial with rapid activity against Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria and fungal/yeast organisms. It may also be effective
against viruses. Veterycin? and Microcyn? contain oxychlorine compounds and
have neutral pH. Its mode of action against microorganisms mimics that of neu-
trophils in the body. Specifically, the hypochlorous acid that is generated through
the oxidative burst process of neutrophils acts as a potent antimicrobial agent
which attacks only single-cell pathogens. As a strong oxidant, hypochlorous acid
is known to react through a variety of pathways with biomolecules. However
the main route of attack against microorganisms is the disruption of the cellular
membrane. It has also demonstrated the ability to speed healing through
increase of oxygen and blood flow to a wound site as well as reduction of
inflammation.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Clip hairsif necessary and apply spray or gel to affected areas up to three times
a day. It may be used with dressing applications in wounds. Do not let the animal
lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to
avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. No rinsing required. Skin may
become red after application due to increased blood flow to lesional site, which
will speed healing. Safe to use around eyes, nose, and mouth. Refer to product
label for details on individual use
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
No precautions or adverse effects reported. Considered as safe as saline. It is
 non-toxic, and does not sting or irritate the skin. Because of its unique mode of
action, neither antibiotic-resistant bacteria nor viruses and fungi can develop an
immmunity to it. Clients should be warned about possible bleaching/staining of
carpets, clothing, jewelry, etc.

Povidone lodine
IN DICATIONS
Povidone iodine is used as a topical presurgical skin cleanser/antiseptic and may
be used for superficial pyoderma and Malassezia dermatitis; however, it is infre-
quently used in small animal dermatology due to its drying. initant, and staining
effects.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Povidone iodine (Pl) is iodine complexed with polyvinylpyrrolidone nitrogen. Pl is
 an antiseptic that works by iodinating and oxidizing sulfhydryl compounds, pep-
tides, proteins, enzymes, vitarmins, lipids, and cytosine found in the cytoplasm
and cytoplasmic membranes. Pl has a wide spectrum of in-vitro activity against
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (bactericidal). fungi. and viruses at
proper concentrations. Povidone acts by slowly releasing iodine to tissues. It has
288
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
prolonged action (4-6 hours), but not as long as chlorhexidine. Pl also has mild
degreasing and debriding activity.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
For veterinary products, refer to product label for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIONSADＶERSE EFFECTS
Povidone may be drying. irritant, and staining to the skin, hair, and fabrics. Can
be extremely irritant to the scrotal skin and external ears. If used with emollients,
the drying effects may be alleviated. Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should
wash hands after application or wear gloves when applying. Systermic absorption
can result in renal and thyroid dysfunction.

Triclosan (lrgasan)
IN DICATIONS
Tridlosan is found in several products, often with other active ingredients. Its
antibacterial effects may be useful in treating superficial pyodermas.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Tridosan is a halogenated bis-phenol bactericidal disinfectant and antiseptic. It
has activity against a wide range of organisms. including Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria, and acts via inhibiting bacterial fatty acid synthesis.
eading to disruption of cell membrane integrity and resulting in apoptosis in
vitro. Triclosan reportedly is not effective against Pseudomonas and may be less
effective against Staphy/ococcus than either chlorhexidine or ethyl lactate
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Daily to weekly baths according to the patient's needs. It is important to leave
the shampoo in contact with the skin for at least 10 minutes prior to rinsing well.
For veteninary products, refer to product label for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
Triclosan should not be used on burmed or denuded skin, or on mucous mem-
branes. Avoid contact with eyes. Triclosan is not recommended as a surgical

HUMAN-LAbELED TRICLOSAN TOPICAL PRGDUCTS
There are several human ticlosan-containing products labeled as hand, face,
or body washes for acne treatment. Trade names include Septisoft?, Cearasil
Antibacterial.Clearasil Daily Face Vash?,Stri-Dex.Oxy Medicated Soap
and ASC?
ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS
Clotrimazole
For otic use, refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Topical clotrimazole has activity against dermatophytes and yeast; it may be par-
ticularly useful for localized lesions associated with Maiassezia. Most available
veterinary products also contain gentamicin and betamethasone and are labeled
for otic use; however, these products are often used extra-label for bacterial and
 yeast skin infections and concurrent inflarmed/pruritic skin.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Clotrimazole, like other azoles, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essen-
tial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to increased membrane per-
 meability and allowing leakage of intracellular components.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
For sprays, twice-daily applications are usually recormrmended. Ointments are
generally applied to affected areas up to four times daily. Do not let the animal
lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to
Section 2: Topical Agents
291
avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. For veterinary products, refer
to product label for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Skin irritation is possible but unlikely. For products containing betamethasone,
tuberculosis of the skin and pregnancy are listed as a contraindication. Use care
when treating large areas with products containing betarmethasone, or when
using on small patients. Risks can be reduced by treating for only as long a5
necessary on as srmall an area as possible. See Betamethasone for details on
potential sice effects. Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should wash hands after
application or wear gloves when applying. At least a Z-week withdrawal period
 recommended for products containing betamethasone prior to intradermal or
allergy serum testing. Use caution when using products containing gentamicin
empirically, to avoid bacterial resistance.

INDICATIONS
Although no products are currently cormrmercially available for topical use in the
US, enilconazole can be compounded as a rinse and used topically for the treat-
ment of dermatophytosis in small animals. A topical rinse, mavero/@ 10%, is
commercially available for the treatment of canine dermatophytosis in EU and
CA. Intranasal instillation of enilconazole after plaque debriderment has also
been shown useful in treating nasal aspergillosis in small animals. Use of topical
enilconazole on cats with dermatophytosis is somewhat controversial as there
are cumently no products with feline labeling available. There are reports of
safety and efficacy in using enilconazole on cats with dermatophytosis as a sole
therapy or in combination with oral itraconazole. A poultry environmental disin-
fectant product (Clinafarm EC?) is available in the US. This formulation has been
used off-label to treat feline dermatophytosis associated with Microsporum
canis. However, it is technically illegal to use this product other than as labeled,
as it is an EPA-licensed product in the US
294
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Enilconazole, like other azoles, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essen-
tial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to increased membrane per-
meability and allowing leakage of intracellular components.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Hairs may need to be clipped/shaved pnior to application to remove as much
infected hair as possible and allow better topical effect. If used to treat feline
dermatophytosis, concurrent systemic antifungal medication is recommended.
mavero/?: dilute as directed and wash or dip four times at 3-day intervals, or until
 two negative fungal cultures are obtained at 2-week intervals. Refer to product
label for details on dilution or individual use. Cinafarm Ec [extra-label use
(Hnilica and Medleau 2002)]: apply to dry hair coat 100 mL of 0.2% enilconazole
solution (diluted from Clinafarm EC? as follows: 14.5mL of the 13.8% concen-
trate added to 1 L of water) every 3 days until two negative fungal cultures are
obtained at 2-week intervals. After each application the cat may be placed in a
kennel and blown dry with cool air. Oral ingestion should be prevented.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should wear gloves and use eye protection
when applying. When used topically in cats, hypersalivation, vomiting. anorexia/
weight loss, muscle weakness, and a slight increase in the liver enzyme ALT
serum levels have been reported.

Ketoconazole
For systemic use, refer to Section 1: Systemic Drugs.
For otic use, refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Topical ketoconazole has activity against dermatophytes and yeast, being espe-
dally useful for the treatment of Maiassezia dermatitis. Topical ketoconazole
shampoos are generally ineffective (or minimally effective) when used alone for
dermatophytosis.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Ketoconazole, like other azoles, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essen-
tial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to increased membrane per-
meability and allowing leakage of intracellular components.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
If using spray or wipes/pads: 1-2 times a day or according to patient's needs. Do not
let the animal lick or chew at treated areas for at least 20-30 minutes after applica-
tion, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. If shampoo or condi-
tioner: daily to weekly baths/after baths according to patient's needs. It is irnportant

Lime Sulfur (Sulfurated Lime Solution)
IN DICATIONS
Lime sulfur applications are very effective and relatively inexpensive as a general-
zed topical treatment for demmatophytosis. Both lime sulfur and enilconazole
are thought to have the best topical activity against Microsporum canis. For
feline dermatophytosis, it should be used as an adjunct to systemic antifungal
therapy. Lime sulfur is anecdotally reported as the most efficacious treatment of
surface demodicosis (Demodex gatoi) in cats. It can also be useful in the adjunc-
tive treatment of Malassezia dermatitis, cheyletiellosis, chiggers, notoedric
mange, fur mites, lice, canine demodicosis, and sarcoptic mange.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Lime sulfur has antibacterial and antifungal/anti-yeast properties secondary to the
formation of pentathionic acid and hydrogen sulfide after application. Lime sulfur
may also have keratolytic, keratoplastic, antiparasitic, and antiprunitic effects.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Labeled dose for LymDyp? and Vet Solutions Lime Su/fur Dip?: Shake well; dilute
4oz of concentrate in 1 gal of water. Mix well. Apply as a dip at 5-7 day intervals.
Do not rinse. For more chronic or resistant cases, may be used at 8oz per gal.
Labeled dose for LimePlus Dip? and Lime Su/fur Dip?: Pour 4oz of concentrate in
1 gal of water. Mix well. Bathe animal prior to application. Rinse off shampoo.
Apply as a dip the entire content of diluted LimePlus Dip? onto pet and work into
skin. Allow to dry on the animal. Do not rinse. Repeat the application every 5-7
days. vvhen used for dermatophytosis, once- to twice-weekly treatments have
been recommended until two consecutive negative cultures are obtained. Wwhen

demodicosis should be ruled out and other diagnoses should be considered
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Lime sulfur has a very
unpleasant smell. Can stain porous surfaces (e.g.. concrete, porcelain) or per-
manently discolor jewelry. Clients should wear gloves and protect skin and
eyes from solution. Application should be performed in a well-ventilated area
or clients should wear a protective (respirator-type) mask. wwhile reasonably
non-toxic, lime sulfur may cause skin irritation or drying. Adding mineral oil to
the solution may reduce its drying effects. Lime sulfur can (temporarily) stain
light-colored fur and rarely cause hair loss on the pinnae in cats. Lime sulfur's

dries. Oral ingestion can rarely cause nausea and oral ulcers, mainly in cats; the
use of an Elizabethan collar until the solution dries may help prevent these
adverse effects

Miconazole Nitrate
For otic use. refer to the Otic section.
INDICATIONS
Topical miconazole has activity against dermatophytes and yeast; it is especially
zed infections may require systemic therapy. Lotions, sprays, and crearms are gen-
erally used for localized lesions associated with Maiassezia or demmatophyte5.
Topical miconazole products are generally ineffective (or minimally effective) when
used alone for demmatophytosis; adjunctive systemic treatment is usually required.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Miconazole's actions are a result of altering the permeability of fungal cellular mem-
branes and interfering with peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzymes, leading to
intracellular necrosis. Miconazole products are fungicidal with repeated application.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
If using spray creams, lotions or wipes/pads: application once or twice a day or
according to the patient's needs. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated
areas for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow
the medication to work. If shampoo or conditioner: daily to weekly baths/after
baths according to the patient's needs. It is important to leave medicated sham-
poos in contact with the skin for at least 10 minutes prior to rinsing well. For
veterinary products, refer to product label for details on individual use.
PRECAUTIONSADＶERSE EFFECTS
Skin irritation is unlikely to occur, but in very inflamed, eroded to ulcerated skin,
the pledgets/wipes, towelettes, and spray containing alcohol (e.g. Malaseb)
can be severely irritant. Avoid contact with eyes. Clients should wash hands after
application or wear gloves when applying.

INDICATIONS
Because of limited dosage forms and other alternative anti-yeast medications
readily available, nystatin is not usually used alone in small animal medicine. The
combination products (e.g.. Panolog) can be useful for localized yeast skin
 infections and have been used for ear infections for many years.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Nystatin has efficacy against yeast (e.g. Candida and Malassezia) and molds
(e.g., Aspergillus). It is fungistatic in vitro. Similar to other polyene antifungal
agents, nystatin binds to ergosterol in the fungal cell membranes, thereby
increasing membrane permeability and resulting in leakage of intracellular
 components and eventual cell death. Nystatin does not have activity against
bacteria
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Treatrent of focal yeast skin infections and otitis externa associated with yeast.
Re-evaluate the patient before discontinuing treatment. For skin lesions apply
1-2 times daily or according to the patient's needs. The veterinary-labeled
products contain triamcinolone; therefore, duration of treatment, especially for
Section 2: Topical Agents
305
the skin, should be short to avoid potential corticosteroid side effects including
skin atrophy. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated area(s) for at least
20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to
work. When using to treat infectious otitis, apply the medication twice daily and
re-evaluate the patient before discontinuing treatment. Treatment of otitis
should be continued until 1 week after negative cytology.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
alaisod ane suooean Asuasiadiy yonouie 'ajes Aaa si auole ueisin
The combination veterinary products are usually well tolerated when used on
skin; however, neomycin can cause localized sensitivity. Use combination prod-
ucts containing qlucocorticoids carefully because of the potential side effects.
ene glycol, nephrotoxicity may potentially develop if they are used on exten-
sive deep lesions. Anecdotally, very rarely. renal toxicity has been reported.
Should use caution in conditions where absorption of large quantities of poly-
ethylene glycol is possible, especially if there is evidence of renal impairment.
Clients should wash hands after application or wear gloves when applying.
Avoid contact with eyes. At least a 2-week withdrawal period is recommended
prior to intradermal or allergy serum testing for products containing corticos-
teroids such as triamcinolone. Use caution when using the medications con-
taining antibiotic such as neomycin empirically to avoid bacterial resistance.

Selenium Sulfide
INDICATIGNS
Selenium sulfide is useful in seborrheic disorders (mainly for seborrhea oleosa)
and for adjunctive treatment of Maiassezia dermatitis, particularly in dogs exhib-
ape jenpisan awos ag Aew anaul seuap Aes io Aseain Kxem jo subis bu
ity on the skin.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Selenium sulfide possesses antifungal (including sporicidal activity), keratolytic
keratoplastic, and degreasing properties. It affects cells of the epidermis and
 follicular epithelium (alters the epidermal turnover) and interferes with hydrogen
bond formation of keratin, thereby reducing corneocyte production. The anti-
fungal mechanism of action of selenium sulfide is not well understood
308
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
When using a medicated shampoo, it is important to allow at least 10 minutes
contact time to obtain the desirable effect of active ingredients. Another accept-
able regimen is to allow the shampoo to act for 3-5 minutes, rinse it thoroughly.
and then repeat the procedure. It is important to completely rinse the shampoo
 to prevent skin irritation and/or excessive drying. The frequency of sharmpooing
will vary according to the patient's needs.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
Selenium sulfide products should not be used on cats. Avoid contact with eyes.
Selenium sulfide can discolor jewelry. Clients should wear gloves when using
selenium sulfide products. Selenium sulfide can be irritant, and can cause exces-
sive drying and hair coat staining. Mucous membranes and scrotal areas may be
particularly sensitive to the irritant effects of the selenium sulfide. A rebound
seborrhea may occur, where siqns not only recur after discontinuation, but
worsen. Vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea may result from ingestion of shampoo
containing selenium sulfide, and neurologic signs may occur if large quantities
are retained in the gastrointestinal tract long enough for systemic absorption to
occur.

Terbinafine Hydrochloride
For systemic use, refer to Section 1: Systemic Drugs.
INDICATIONS
An allylamine antifungal agent, topical terbinafine may be useful as adjunctive
therapy for localized skin lesions associated with Malassezia. It may also be used
 25 adjunctive therapy for dermatophytosis in cats and dogs.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Terbinafine hydrochloride (HCl) inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol by inhibit-
ing the fungal squalene epoxidase enzyme. The resultant depletion of ergosterol
within the fungal cell membrane and the intracellular accumulation of squalene
are believed to be responsible for the fungicidal effect of terbinafine.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Apply the product to the affected area(s) twice daily until complete resolution of
the skin lesions. It is recommended to prevent the animal from licking or chew-
ing at the treated area(s) for at least 30 minutes after application, to avoid inges-
tion and allow the medication to work
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and open wounds. Clients should
wash hands after application or wear gloves when applying the drug. Skin irrita-
tion is possible, but unlikely to occur.

HUMAN-LABELED PHYTOSPHINGGSINE TOPICAL PRODUCTS
There are several OTC human cosmetic products containing phytosphingosine in
the US. These products target mostly lipid barrier restoration and include Epionce
Extreme Barrier Cream, Kronos Phyx Overnight Repair Mask, Skinceuticais Age
hterruptor, and Darphin Lipid Replenishing Soothing Baim?
Salicylic Acid
IN DICATIONS
Salicylic acid shampoos, in which salicylic acid is often combined with sulfur, are
typically erployed to treat patients with seborrheic disorders exhibiting mild to
 moderate scaling (seborrhea sicca). When salicylic acid and sulfur are combined
with benzoyl peroxide, the shampoos can also be used to manage seborrhea
oleosa.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Salicylic acid has mild antipruritic, antibacterial (bacteriostatic). keratoplastic,
and keratolytic actions. Lower concentrations (0.1-2 %) are prirmarily keratoplas-
tic and higher concentrations (3-6%) keratolytic. Salicylic acid lowers skin pH,
increases corneocyte hydration, and dissolves the intercellular adhesion between
cormeocytes. Salicylic acid and sulfur are thought to be synergistic in their kera-
tolytic actions.

HUMAN-LABELED SAlICYlIC ACID TOPICAL PRODUCTS
There are many topical salicylic acid products labeled for human use, including
topical creams, ointments, transdermal patches, liquids, and gels that are princi-
pally labeled for wart removal. Except for one product (Salex; 6% cream), they
are available OTC. There are also many OTC skin cleansers and shampoos
containing salicylic acid and usually sulfur (sometimes coal tar or menthol).
As there are several sirmilar products forrmulated and labeled for animal use,
human products are not listed here. For more information on these products.
refer to a comprehensive human drug reference (e.g.. Facts and Comparisons or
Micromecex) or contact a pharmacist.
Sulfur, Precipitated
INDICATIONS
Shampoos containing sulfur, often combined with salicylic acid, are typically
used to treat patients with seborrheic disorders exhibiting mild to moderate
scaling.
MECHANISM GF ACTION
Sulfur has keratoplastic and keratolytic actions. Lower concentrations of sulfur
are primarily keratoplastic by assisting the conversion of cysteine to cystine.
which appears to be an important factor in the maturation of cormeocytes. As
with salicylic acid, the keratolytic effects of sulfur increase with its concentration.
Salicylic acid and sulfur are believed to be synergistic in their keratolytic action5.
Sulfur can be mildly antipruritic, but it is not a good degreaser. Sulfur also has
antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic effects as a result of its conversion to
hydrogen sulfide and pentathionic acid by bacteria and keratocytes.

HUMAN-LABELED SULFUR TOPICAL PRGDUCTS
There are several topical products containing sulfur labeled for human use,
including topical creams, lotions, shampoos, 5oaps, and masks that are princi-
pally labeled for acne or dandruff. For more information on these products, refer
to a comprehensive human drug reference (e.g. Facts and Comparisons or
Mfcromecex) or contact a pharmacist.
Tar, Coal
At the time of writing. many veterinary-labeled coal tar products have been
withdrawn from the market due to concerns that coal tar may be carcinogenic
This action does not appear to be an FDA mandate, but a voluntary withdrawal
from the marketplace
INDICATIONS
Use of shampoos containing coal tar in veterinary medicine is somewhat contro-
versial, particularly since all veterinary-labeled products have been withdrawn
from the market. However, coal tar shampoos have been used in dogs for treat-
ing seborrhea oleosa for many years.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Coal tar possesses keratoplastic, keratolytic, vasoconstrictive, antipruritic, anti-
inflarnmatory, and degreasing actions. Its keratoplastic (keratoregulating) action
6 probably secondary to decreasing mitosis and DNA synthesis of basal epider
mal cells.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
When using a medicated shampoo, it is important to allow at least 10 minutes
able regimen is to allow the shampoo to act for 3-5 minutes, rinse it thoroughly.
and then repeat the procedure. It is important to completely rinse the shampoo
to prevent skin initation and/or excessive drying. The frequency of shampooing
will vary according to the patient's needs
PRECAUTIGNS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
The carcinogenic risks associated with coal tar products are debated. At present,
most (including the FDA) believe that coal tar products with concentrations of
5% or less are safe for human use. However, should they be used on animals,
dients should wear gloves when applying and wash off any product that con-
tacts their skin. Carcinogenic risk assessment for dogs using coal tar products is
not currently available. Coal tar products should not be used on cats because
they are especially sensitive to the adverse effects of coal tar. Avoid use in
dermatoses. Be careful in comparing coal tar concentrations on labels. Coal
tar solution contains approximately 2o% coal tar extract or refined tar. For
example, a 10% coal tar solution contains approximately 2% coal tar (refined).
Photosensitization, skin drying and skin irritation are possible with tar therapy.
Adverse effects are more likely with tar concentrations greater than 3 %. Residual

IMMUNOMODULATORY AGENTS
Imiquimod
INDICATIONS
An immune response modifier, imiquimod may be useful in the treatment of a
variety of skin conditions in animals. In humans, it is labeled for genital or peri-
anal warts, superficial basal cell carcinomas, and actinic keratoses of the face
and scalp. Examples of extra-label use of this drug in humans include mycosis
fungoides, other types of cutaneous lymphomas, squamous cell carcinoma,
Bowen's disease, infant hemangiomas (antiangiogenic effect), molluscum conta-
giosum, and cutaneous leishmaniasis (in combination with meglumine antimoni-
ate). In dogs and cats, imiquimod may be of benefit in treating actinic keratosis,
squamous cell carcinoma, Bowenoid disease, pigmented epidermal plaques and
other papillomavirus-associated lesions, feline herpes virus dermatitis, and local-
zed actinic dermatitis or solar-induced carcinoma in situ. Most of these recom-
mendations are anecdotal or based on very few studies.
320
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Imiquimod is an imidazoquinolone compound that binds to tollike receptor 7
and stimulates the patient's own irnrnune systerm to release a variety of cytokines
including interferon-alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-12. This locally generated cytokine
milieu induces a Th1 irmmune response with the generation of cytotoxic effec-
tors. Imiquimod does not have in-vitro activity against viruses, but stimulates
monocytes and macrophages to release cytokines that induce a regression in
viral protein production.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Use in animals is still rather limited, and ongoing research on this agent is being
performed. Doses and treatment regimens will vary depending on the disease
treated and tolerance to the dnug. Typically. dosing ranges from applying a thin
film once daily to 2-3 times weekly or every other week. Do not let the animal
lick or chew at treated area(s) for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to
avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. Treatment duration and fre-
quency may need to be adjusted depending on response and adverse reaction5.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
 Clients should wear gloves when handling or applying the cream. It is advised to
avoid getting in eyes or on mucous membranes; however, dogs with oral
mucosal papillomas, dogs and horses with cormeal squamous cell carcinomas.
and horses with periocular sarcoids have been treated without significant ocular
problems. While there are low chances for the drug to be absorbed systemically
do not allow the animal to groom/lick the treated site for at least 30 minutes
after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work. Occlusive
dressings should not be used over the applied areas. Avoid exposure of the site
to sunlight, as there are anecdotal concerns of increased risks of sun darnage

Pimecrolimus
IN DICATIONS
 A relatively new addition to the human topical armamentarium, pimecrolimus
qeam may be anecdotally beneficial in veteninary patients in the adjunctive
treatment of atopic dermatitis. discoid lupus erythematosus, pemphigus
erythematosus, pinnal vascular disease or other cutaneous vasculopathies,
aopecia areata, vitiligo. perianal fistulas (maintenance treatment after
cyclosporine therapy). and feline proliferative and necrotizing otitis extera.
Unlike topical corticosteroids, pimecrolimus does not have atrophogenic or
metabolic effects associated with long-term or large-area treatment.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Fimecrolimus, similarly to cyclosporine, acts by inhibiting T-lymphocyte activation,
primarily by interfening with the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which
ultimately results in the blockage of various cytokine genes transcription,
especially interleukin-2. It also inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines and
 mediators frorm mast cells and basophils. Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus may not
have identical mechanisms of action, as pimecrolimus, in contrast to tacrolimus,
did not impair the primary irnmune response in mice after a contact sensitizer
was applied. Both drugs. however, did impair the secondary immune response.
Any clinical significance associated with this difference is not yet clear.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
There is limited experience with this drug in veterinary patients. Most dosing
recommendations are to use the product twice daily until signs are controlled
and then reduce application frequency to the lowest level that maintains the
disease under control. Do not let the animal lick or chew at treated area(s) for
at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the
medication to work.

Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
 Both tacrolirnus and pimecrolimus have FDA-mandated "black box" warnings
that their use may increase risks for skin cancer and lymphormas in humans;
however, most of the data demonstrating carcinogenic risk have come from
 anirmal models using greatly excessive doses of pirmecrolirmus administered orally.
and there is no current evidence of a causal relationship between the use of
these medications and the occurrence of malignancy in humans. Therefore.
topical use of pirmecrolirnus is probably relatively safe in veterinary patients.
However, clients should be informed and instructed to wear gloves or use an
applicator (e.g.. a Q-tip) when applying the cream, mainly because of the
immunosuppressive effects of the drug.
The long-term adverse effects of topical pimecrolimus are currently unknown;
therefore. it is prudent to avoid using this medication on a continuous-
maintenance basis. Wwhen long-term treatment is required, the ultimate goal
should be to achieve the lowest possible dose that maintains the disease under
control. Topical pimecrolimus is apparently well tolerated in dogs, but localized
irritation, erythema, and pruritus have been reported in humans and dogs using
the drug. Anecdotal reports state that pimecrolimus may be less irritating than
tacrolimus in dogs, but also may not be quite as effective. The cost of the
medication may be prohibitive for some clients. One study has shown that
tacrolimus applied daily for 4 weeks did not interfere with the intradermal test
reactivity in dogs (Marsella et af. 2o04). No similar studies have been conducted
using pimecrolimus, but similar results can be expected.

treated with the drug. The medication may be cost-prohibitive for some clients
When using tacrolimus 0.1% ointment once daily for 4 weeks, no withdrawal
tirne is recommended prior to intraderrmal testing for evaluation of irmmediate
leactions; however, a 4-week withdrawal is recommended for evaluation of late-
phase reactions. (Marsella et af. 2oo4). Wvhether tacrolimus needs to be withdrawn

RETINOIDS
Adapalene (Retinoid Analog)
INDICATIONS
In humans, adapalene is indicated for the treatrment of acne vulgaris. In animals.,
adapalene may be useful in treating canine or feline chin acne.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Adapalene is a naphthoic acid derivative and retinoid analog. The mechanism of
action of adapalane in acne vulgaris is unknown, but, similarly to tretinoin and
tazarotene, adapalane may modulate follicular epithelial cell differentiation and
keratinization, thus preventing the formation of comedones. Moreover, in-vitro
 studies have shown that adapalene may reduce inflammation.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
There is limited experience with adapalene in veterinary medicine; however.
similarly to topical tretinoin and tazarotene, it can be used initially at a high con-
centration (0.3%) and once daily. Treatment should be continued until the con-
dition is controlled and as long as the animal tolerates the treatment. Once the
condition is controlled, frequency of administration is reduced to as needed. In
animals unable to tolerate therapy. the concentration may be reduced to 0.1 %
in an attempt to balance efficacy with adverse effects. Do not let the animal lick
or chew at treated area(s) for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid
ingestion and allow the medication to work
PRECAUTIONSADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes, nostrils, or mouth. Clients should wear gloves when
applying the product. Adverse effects can include hypersensitivity reactions or local
irritation charactenized by erythema, dryness, peeling. pruritus. Avoid sun exposure
during treatment with adapalene. Avoid use in pregnant or nursing animals.

INDICATIONS
h humans, tazarotene therapy is primarily indicated for acne vulgaris, plague
psoriasis, and photodamaged skin. It has also been used for the treatment of
bmellar ichthyosis and Darier's disease. In animals, topical tazarotene, similar to
tretinoin, may be useful in treating localized follicular or hyperkeratotic disorders
such as schnauzer comedo syndrome, chin acne, or idiopathic nasal and footpad
hyperkeratosis. It is important to note that these recommendations are anecdo-
 tal and not based on scientific evidence.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
-an jo lope jo wsiueyoaw pexa aul pioual yoeiauab-pyt e s! auatoeze
 noids is not well understood, but they may have anti-inflarmmatory and irmmu-
nomodulatory effect by stimmulating cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells,
inhibiting polymorphonuclear cells and suppressing lymphocyte proliferation.
Retinoids also have an antineoplastic effect by maintaining epithelial cell differ-
entiation and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. The effect of tazarotene in acne
wulgaris is unknown, but studies have shown that it inhibits cormeocyte accumu-
lation and the formation of cross-linked envelopes. It is possible that different
retinoids have different mechanisms of action, and that they may be effective in
dfferent diseases.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
There is limited experience with tazarotene in veterinary medicine; however.
similarly to topical tretinoin it can be used initially at a high concentration (O. 1 %)
and once daily. Treatment should be continued until the condition is controlled
and as long as the animal tolerates the treatment. Once the condition is con-
trolled, the frequency of administration is reduced to as needed. In animals
unable to tolerate therapy. the concentration can be reduced to 0.05% in an
attempt to balance efficacy with adverse effects. Do not let the animal lick or
dhew at treated area(s) for at least 20-30 minutes after application, to avoid
ingestion and allow the medication to work.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes, nostrils, or mouth. Clients should wear gloves when
applying the product. Adverse effects can include hypersensitivity reactions or local
irritation characterized by erythema, dryness, peeling. pruritus. Avoid sun exposure
during treatment with tazarotene. Avoid use in pregnant or nursing animals.

Tretinoin (All-Trans Retinoic Acid; Vitamin A Acid)
INDICATIONS
 In humans, the primary indication of topical tretinoin therapy is acne vulgaris and
photodamaged skin. In animals, topical tretinoin may be useful in treating local-
ized hyperkeratotic disorders such as schnauzer cormedo syndrome, idiopathic
nasal and footpad hyperkeratosis, or chin acne. It is important to note that these
recommendations are anecdotal and not based on scientific evidence
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) is a retinoid derived from the naturally occurring
vitamin-A alcohol. The exact mechanism of action of retinoids is not well under-
stood, but they may have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect by
stimulating cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells, inhibiting polymorphonuclear
cells and suppressing lymphocyte proliferation. Retinoids also have an antineo-
cell proliferation. Tretinoin appears to prevent new comedone fommation and
eliminate the formed ones, hence its benefit in the treatment of acne. This effect
 is rmediated by stimulating the mitotic activity and turnover of follicular epithelial
cells and decreasing their cohesiveness. It is possible that different retinoids have
different mechanisms of action, and that they may be effective in different
diseases.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
In small animals, topical tretinoin gel is anecdotally used initially at a concentra-
tion of O.05% and is applied once daily. Treatment should be continued until the
condition is controlled and as long as the animal tolerates the treatment. Once
the condition is controlled, the frequency of administration is reduced to as
needed. In animals unable to tolerate therapy, the concentration may be reduced
to 0.025%-0.01 % in an attempt to balance efficacy with adverse effects. Do
not let the animal lick or chew at treated area(s) for at least 20-30 minutes after
application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medication to work
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Avoid contact with eyes, nostrils, or mouth. Clients should wear gloves when
applying the product. Adverse effects can include hypersensitivity reactions
or local irritation characterized by erythema, dryness, peeling. pruritus. Avoid
 sun exposure during treatment with tretinoin. Avoid use in pregnant or nursing
animals.

Amitraz
INDICATIONS
Amitraz solution is the only FDA-approved treatment for canine demodicosis. It
has also been used successfully to manage canine sarcoptic mange and feline
surface (caused by Demodex gato) or follicular demodicosis (caused by Demodex
cati). Amitraz is used in cats at lower doses than the ones used in dogs, because
328Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
cats are more susceptible to its adverse effects. The authors do not typically use
amitraz as first-line therapy for demodicosis, since there are more efficacious and
more easily administered treatment options currenty available, such as ivermec-
tin. The Preventic collar is available for treatment and prevention of flea and tick
infestations.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The pharmacologic action of amitraz is not well understood. It is a monoamine
oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (in mites) and may have effects on the CNS of susceptible
organisms. It  apparently  also has alpha-2-adrenergic activity and  inhibits
prostaglandin synthesis. Amitraz can cause a significant increase in plasma glucose
levels, presumably by inhibiting insulin release via its alpha-2-adrenergic activity
Yohirnbine (an alpha-2 blocker) or atiparmezole can antagonize this effect.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Dogs
For generalized demodicosis: Prior to using amitraz any obstacle (e.g..
crusting. excessive oil, and/or keratin debns) that could prevent good penetration
of the solution into the hair follicle canals should be removed. Therefore, long-
and medium-haired dogs should be clipped closely and given a bath with benzoyl
peroxide or other appropriate shampoo before the application of amitraz. Make
sure, thereafter, to thoroughly dry the skin and hair coat to prevent dilution of

admministered treatrment options currently available, such as ivermectin. If amitraz
is selected, the authors advise to use it only when the diagnosis of sarcoptic
mange has been confimed by positive skin scrapings (i.e., do not use amitraz in
treatment trials), because of anecdotal reports of treatment failures. Protocor:

Cats
Not labeled to treat feline demodicosis
For follicular demodicosis (Demodex cati): Dilute amitraz to 0.0125%
(125 ppm) and apply every 7-14 days. Monitor cats very closely for potential side
effects. Place an Elizabethan collar until the solution is completely dry
For surface demodicosis (Demodex gato): Amitraz was reported to be
efficacious to treat surface demodicosis when used at 0.0125% solution applied
weekly as a dip for 12 weeks (Saari et ar. 2009). Monitor cats very closely for
potential side effects. Place an Elizabethan collar until the solution is completely dry.
PRECAUTIONSADVERSE EFFECTS/DRUG INTERACTIONS
Amitraz liquid concentrates are flammable until diluted with water. Do not stress
animals for at least 24 hours after application of Mitaban?. Wwhen mixing with
water, protect exposed skin with nubber gloves. Wvash hands and arms well after
application to animal. Dispose of unused diluted solution by flushing down the
drain. Rinse Mitaban? container with water and dispose; do not reuse. Do not
'sioden jo uoejeuu! piony ysen u moiun pue jadedsmau ui deim iellos asnal
Safety has not been demonstrated in dogs less than 4 months of age, and the
manufacturer of Mitaban? does not recommend use in these animals. Toy breeds
may be more susceptible to CNS effects (transient sedation): therefore, lower
dose rates (half of recommended) have been recommended in these breeds
Because of amitraz effects on plasma glucose, use with caution in diabetic
patients. Reproductive safety has not been established. Use only when benefits
outweigh potential risks of therapy.
The most commonly reported adverse effect after amitraz topical administra-
tion is transient sedation that may persist for up to 72 hours (24 hours is usual). If
treating around eyes, use an ophthalmic protectant (e.g. petrolatum ophthalmic
cintment) before treating. Do not use if dog has deep pyoderma with draining
 tract5; postpone application until lesions improve after treating with antibiotic and
shampoo therapy. Other adverse effects include ataxia, bradycardia, vomiting.
diarhea, hypothermia, and a transient hyperglyceria. Rarely, seizures have been
leported. Topical effects can include edema, erythema, and pruritus. Adverse
effects are more likely to be seen in debilitated, geriatric, or very srmall breed dogs

Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
Amitraz can be toxic to cats and rabbits, and it is probably best to avoid its use
in these species; however, amitraz has been used safely in cats in diluted form
for the treatment of demodicosis (see above)
Amitraz may be toxic if swallowed (by either animals or humans). Beagles
sion, hyperglycemia, decreased pulse rates, and lowered body temperature; no
animals died. Amitraz toxicity can be significant if amitraz-containing insecticide
collars are ingested. Treatment should consist of emesis, retrieval of the collar
using endoscopy if possible, and administration of activated charcoal and a cathar-
tic to remove any remaining collar fragments. Because of the risk of an increased
chance of gastric dilatation, gastrotomy may not be a viable option. Yohimbine at
a dose of 0.11- 0.2 mg/kg IV (start with low dosage) may be of benefit for over-
dose effects. Because yohimbine has a short half-life it may need to be repeated.
particularly if the anirmal has ingested an amitraz-containing collar that has not
been retrieved from the gastrointestinal tract. Atipamezole has also been used to
 treat amitraz toxicity. Contact a poison center for more inforrmation, if necessary.
Because of their immunosuppressive effects, corticosteroids and other
immunosuppressant drugs (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclo-
sporine) should not be used in animals with dermodicosis.
Amitraz may interact with other MAO inhibitors (including selegiline) or tri-
cyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, domipramine). Concomitant use is
not recommended. Sun exposure should be avoided until amitraz solution has
dried completed.

Deltamethrin
INDICATIONS
In the US, deltamethnin-impregnated collars are recommended for killing fleas
and ticks on dogs. In countries where leishmaniasias is a problem, deltamethrin-
impregnated collars are also indicated for repelling and killing the phlebotomine
sandfly vectors.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Deltamethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid and acts by disrupting the sodium channel
aurrent in arthropod nerve cell membranes, resulting in paralysis and death
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
The manufacturer recommends applying a new collar every 6 months, and
daims that maximum effect may not occur before 2-3 weeks after collar
pacement. Follow label for specific use instructions.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Deltamethrin should not be used on dogs younger than 12 weeks of age. It can
be harmful if swallowed or absorbed through the skin. Avoid contact with eyes,
skin, or clothing. Exercise caution when applying the product on debilitated,
pregnant, nursing. old, or medicated anirmals. Skin reaction at the application
ite may occur. Mammalian exposure to deltamethrin is classified as safe;
however, it should be used very carefully around water because it is highly toxic
to aquatic animals, especially fish.

Dinotefuran + Pyriproxyfen, ± Permethrin
INDICATIONS
The product containing dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen (Vectra), labeled for dogs
and cats, is used for control of adult and allimrature flea stages including eggs,

addition to dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen (Vectra 3De) kills and repels adult and
immature fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Dinotefuran is a nitroguanidine, neonicotinoid insecticide with a structure similar
to acetylcholine. It permanently binds to the same insect receptor sites as acetyl-
choline and activates the nerve impulse at the synapse, causing stimulation that
results in tremors, incoordination, and insect death. Dinotefuran does not bind
to mammalian acetylcholine receptor sites.

lates the molting of insects from one stage to the other. High concentrations of
juvenile hommone prevent molting to the next flea stage. Normally, this hormone
 is broken down by an esterase, resulting in low concentrations and insect molt-
ing. Because pyriproxyfen is not broken down by juvenile hormone esterase, any
flea stages exposed to high concentrations of pyriproxyfen are unable to molt to
the next stage, and die
Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid with rapid knockdown and repellent
effects against fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. It is a neurotoxin that binds to the
voltage-gated sodium channel, preventing it from closing normally and thereby
causing repetitive activity in the sensory and motor pathways. This results in
tremors, incoordination, and insect death
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Refer to the package information for specific instructions on application and
dosages of dinotefuran-containing products. Monthly applications are recom-

Frombicuia autumnalis (chigger) infestation, sarcoptic mange. cheyletiellosis,
and otoacariosis.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Fpronil is a phenylpyrazole antiparasitic agent that in invertebrates inhibits the
passage of chloride ions in GABA (gama-aminobutiric acid)- and glutamate-
regulated chloride channels, resulting in nervous system hyperactivity and
ultimate parasite death. The manufacturer states that fipronil accumulates in the

Imidacloprid Combinations
INDICATIONS
The imidacloprid and pyriproxyfen topical solution (Acvantage //?) is indicated
for the prevention and treatment of all flea stages in dogs and cats and chewing
lice in dogs. The imidacloprid, permethrin, and pyriproxyfen product (K9 Acvantix
 - for dogs only) is indicated for repelling and killing fleas (all stages), ticks, and
mosquitoes. Moreover, it repels biting flies and kills chewing lice. The imidaclo-
prid and moxidectin product (Advantage Muiti® for Dogs in the US and
Acvocate? in EU) is labeled for the prevention of heartworm disease, adult flea5,
adult and immature hookworms, adult and immature roundworms (Toxocara
canis), and adult whipworms. It has been also used successfully for the treatment
of sarcoptic mange, cheyletiellosis, and mild cases of demodicosis. The feline
combination product (Acvantage Mu/ti? for Cats) is indicated for the prevention
of heartworm disease, adult fleas, ear mites, in addition to adult and immature
hookworms and roundworms.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Imidacloprid acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic mem-
brane, causing CNs impairment and death. lnsects have more nicotinic acetyl-
choline receptors than mammals and are therefore more sensitive to these
agents. This is a different mechanism of action than other insecticidal agents
Section 2: Topical Agents
(GRs),. and insect development inhibitors (IDls). The manufacturer states that
when applied topically the compound is not absorbed into the bloodstream or
internal organs
Moxidectin, present in Aovantage Muiti?, is a macrocyclic lactone, and as
such it binds to the glutamate-gated ion channels specific to parasites and
ncreases the influx of chloride ions, resulting in hyperpolarization of neuronal
cells and paralysis and death of the parasite
Permethrin, present in K9 Aovantix f/?, is a pyrethroid (synthetic pyrethrin) that
kills and repels ticks and mosquitoes. Permethrin acts by disrupting the sodium
dhannel current in arthropod nerve cell mermbranes, resulting in paralysis and
death.
ation IGR and acts by interrupting the development of flea eggs. larvae, and
early pupae. It mimics the action of an IGH known as juvenile hommone, which
regulates the molting of insects from one stage to the other
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Refer to the package information for specific instructions on application of
imidacloprid products. They are generally administered once monthly. While
swimming. bathing. and rain do not apparently significantly affect the duration
of action, repeated shampooing may require additional treatment(s) before the
monthly dosing interval is completed. Do not reapply more often than once
weekly for these animals. Recommended treatment protocols for the extra-
label use of imidacloprid combined with moxidectin (Acvantage Mu/ti?) are as
follow5:
tions at 3-week intervals, at the dose recormrmended by the manufacturer per
body weight.
For cheyletiellosis: Two applications at a 4-week interval, at the dose recom-
mended by the manufacturer per body weight
For generalized demodicosis: Weekly to every-other-week applications, using
the manufacture's recommended dose per body weight for 30 days past two
consecutive negative skin scrapings. The authors only recommend using this
medication for mild cases, because of its limited efficacy. Better results can be
cbtained with weekly applications compared to bi-weekly (Paterson et al. 2009)
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS/OVERDOSES
The manufacturer lists the following contraindications for imidacloprid (alone):

debilitated, aged, pregnant, or nursing animals, or those on medication.
prid topical formulations. The imidacloprid combination product with perme
thrin and pyriproxyfen (K9 Advantix H) must not be used on cats. Avoid this
combination product in households with both dogs and cats, particularly if cats
are in close contact or will groom dogs in the household. The manufacturer
states that imidaclopridis non-teratogenic, non-hypersensitizing, non-mutagenic,
non-allergenic, non-carcinogenic, and non-photosensitizing

When the product is used as directed, adverse effects are unlikely. Because the
drug is bitter-tasting. oral contact may cause excessive salivation. Hypersalivation,
tremors, vomiting. and reduced appetite may occur in cats after oral exposure to
Advantage Mu/t/?. Uncommon to rare adverse reactions reported in dogs treated
with Acvantage Mu/t/? in a field study included pruritus, lethargy. reduced appe-
tite, and hyperactivity. Do not get product in eyes. If eye contact occurs (human
 or anirnal), flush well with ophthalmic irrigation solution or water. Vhile gloving
is not mandated, it should be encouraged, as contact with skin should be
avoided. Wwash hands with soap and water after handling. Keep out of reach of
children and do not contaminate feed or food. Dispose of product carefully (in
the trash): the permethrin-containing product is extremely toxic to fish. There
were 188 exposures to imidacloprid reported to the ASPCA Animal Poison
 Control Center (APCC; www.apcc.aspca.org) during 2005-2006. Of these cases
95 were dogs. with 11 showing clinical signs, and 92 were cats. in which 20
showed clinical signs. Common findings in dogs, in decreasing frequency.
included vomiting. diarrhea, and hypersalivation. Common findings in cats, in
decreasing frequency included hypersalivation, vomiting. and anorexia.

Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
(S)-Methoprene Combinations
INDICATIONS
Methoprene is usually added to premise sprays and topical products labeled for
dogs and cats to eliminate insects (usually fleas), via its ability to prevent matura-
tion of eggs or larva.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
(S)-Methoprene mimics insect juvenile growth hormone, halting larval develop-
rment during metarmorphosis and interrupting the flea life cycle. It also concen-
trates in female flea ovaries, causing non-viable eggs to be produced. Wwhen it is
combined with an adulticide (e.g.. pemmethrin, fipronil, phenothrin), all stages of
the parasite are killed and re-infestation is less likely.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
 For specific use and dosage recommendations, refer to the product's label
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Methoprene may be found in products also containing permethrin or pheno-
thrin, which can be toxic to cats, particularly srmall kittens. Only use on cats
those products containing permethrin or other pyrethroids labeled
specifically for use on cats. Hypersensitivity can occur to these compounds
Do not use in eyes or on mucous membranes. Methoprene (used alone) has
low toxicity in mammmals. Potentially. skin irritation or hypersensitivity reaction5
could occur. As methoprene is broken down by UV light, protect unused product
from light.

INDICATIONS
Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid that acts as an adulticide insecticide/miticide.
It has knockdown activity against fleas, lice, ticks, and certain mites (e.g..
Cheyletieiia, Sarcoptes scabiei)) and also has repellent activity. In small animal
 medicine, it is used prirmarily for control of flea and tick infestations on dogs.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
 Permethrin acts by disrupting the sodiurn channel current in arthropod nerve cell
membranes, resulting in paralysis and death
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
For specific use and dosage recommendations, refer to the product's label
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Permethrin (and other synthetic pyrethroids) can be very toxic to cats.
particularly small kittens; therefore, only use products containing pyre-
throids labeled for use on cats. Moreover, permethrin-containing products
should not be used in households with both dogs and cats where the specific
product is prohibited for use on cats. Hypersensitivity to these compounds can
Occur. Do not use in eyes or on mucous mermbranes. Pruritus or mild skin irrita-
tions are uncommon but can occur at the application site. Clients should wear
gloves when applying and wash off any product that contacts their skin

Picaridin
INDICATIONS
 Picaridin is a human-labeled insect and acarid repellent of mosquitos, flies, fleas,
ticks, and chiggers that may be used on dogs and cats. Picaridin is considered as
effective as but safer than products based on DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide)
which may not be safe for use on dogs and cats
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Picaridin, also known as icaridin, pikaridin, propidine, and hydroxyethyl isobutyl
piperidine carboxylate (INCl), is a piperidine derivative. The exact mechanismm of
action is unknown. Picaridin both repels and deters insects, so that insects move
away from the chemical and do not feed if they encounter skin or clothing that
has been treated. Insects appear to detect the chermical through olfactory sens-
ing. Picaridin was shown to stimulate sensory hairs on the mosquito's antennae.
and this appears to prevent the insect from recognizing its host's cues. Picaridin
has no adverse affect on plastic, synthetics, plastic coatings. and sealants. It is
 almost colorless and odorless.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
The use of picaridin on dogs and cats is completely anecdotal. Labeled for topical
use only. For specific use recommendations, refer to the products label for
human use.
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
There is very limited information on the adverse effects of picaridin in dogs. No
dermal or systemic toxicity were observed when picaridin was used at 50, 100.
and 2o0 mg/kg in dogs in laboratory studies. There are no infommative reports on
potential adverse effects of picaridin in cats.

Pyrethrin Combinations
For otic use, refer to the Otic section
INDICATIONS
Pyrethrins are naturally derived insecticides that act as an adulticide insecticides/
miticides. They have knockdown activity against fleas, lice, ticks, and Cheyletiefla.
 In small anirmal medicine, pyrethrins are used primarily for fleas and ticks on dogs
Se Pue
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Pyrethrins act by disrupting the sodium channel current in arthropod nerve cel
membranes, resulting in paralysis and death. Pyrethrins are often found in com-
bination with the insect growth regulators, methoprene or pyriproxyfen and
with the synergist piperonyl butoxide. Piperonyl butoxide inhibits insect meta-
 bolic enzymes (cytochrorme P450 system). allowing a lower dose of primary
insecticide to be used.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
 For specific use and dosage recormmendations, refer to the product's label.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
Pyrethrins are among the safest insecticidal products available, but cats should
not be allowed to groom wet product after using dips or sprays.
Hypersensitivity to these compounds can occur. Do not use in eyes or on
 mucous membranes. Avoid hypothermia when using liquid products (sprays,
dips, etc.), particularly in small animals and when ambient temperatures are
low. Pruritus or mild skin irritation can occur at application site, but uncom-
rmonly. Clients should wear gloves when applying and wash off any product
that contacts their skin.

Pyriproxyfen Combinations
For products containing dinotefuran, refer to the Dinotefuran + Pyriproxyfen, ±
Permethrin listing
INDICATIONS
 Like methoprene, pyriproxyfen is an insect growth regulator. It is added to prem-
ise sprays and topical products labeled for dogs and cats to eliminate insects
(usually fleas) via its ability to prevent maturation of eggs or larva.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Pyriproxyfen is a second-generation insect growth regulator and acts by inter-
npting the development of flea eggs. larvae, and early pupae. It mimics the
action of an insect growth hormone known as juvenile hormone, which regu-
lates the molting of insects from one stage to the other. High concentrations of
juvenile hormone prevent insect molting to the next stage. Normally, this hor-
mone is broken down by an esterase, resulting in low concentrations and insect
molting. Because pyriproxyfen is not broken down by juvenile hormone esterase,
any flea stages exposed to high concentrations of pyriproxyfen are unable to
molt to the next stage, and die.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
For specific use and dosage recommendations, refer to the product's label
PRECAUTIGNS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
be toxic to cats, particularly small kittens. Only use on cats those products
containing permethrin or other pyrethroids labeled specifically for cats.
Pyriproxyfen (used alone) has low toxicity in mammals. Potentially, skin irritation
or hypersensitivity reactions could occur. Clients should wear gloves when apply-
ing products containing permethrin or other insecticides, and wash off any prod-
uct that contacts their skin.

Rotenone
INDICATIONS
Dermatologists will occasionally prescribe rotenone to treat the localized form of
canine demodicosis when clients request an intervention, despite the high likeli-
hood for spontaneous resolution of this disease.
MECHANISM QF ACTION
Rotenone works by interfering with the electron transport chain in the mito-
chondria, preventing the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a usable form of cellular energy.
Rotenone occurs naturally in the roots and stems of various tropical and sub-
tropical plants, especially the ones from the genus Lonchocarpus or Derris. It is
characterized as a broad-spectrum pesticide, insecticide, and piscicide.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
Apply to the affected area(s) once daily until two consecutive negative skin
scrapings are obtained. Prevent the animal from licking at the treated area(s) for
at least 30 minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the medica-
tion to work.
PRECAUTIONSADＶERSE EFFECTS
Rotenone is mildly toxic to mammals; however, it is very toxic to fish and insects

Spinetoram
INDICATIONS
Spinetoram (Assurity ?) is recommended by the manufacturer for the prevention
and treatment of flea infestations in cats and kittens 8 weeks of age or older
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Spinetoram activates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) causing
the death of fleas. The manufacturer claims that Assurity ? starts working within
30 minutes and kills 98-100% of fleas within 12 hours.
Section 2: Topical Agents
361
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
One low-volume dose treats cats of all sizes/body weights. The manufacturer
recommends applying the tube contents topically to the skin at the base of the
cat's neck once monthly. Refer to package insert for more details
PRECAUTIONS/ADVERSE EFFECTS
For external use on cats and kittens only. Do not use on kittens less than 8 weeks
 of age. The manufacturer recommends veterinarian consultation prior to using
the product on debilitated, aged, pregnant, or nursing animals, or animals
known to be sensitive to pesticides. Sensitivities, such as hair sparseness, hair
bss, skin irritation or discoloration, or salivation, may occur. Spinetoram can be
hazardous to humans if swallowed. It causes moderate eye irritation. Vash thor-
 oughly with soap and water after handling and before eating., drinking. chewing
gum, or using tobacco. Avoid contact with eyes or clothing.

Capsaicin
INDICATIONS
Capsaicin has been anecdotally recommended for the treatment of acral lick
peann ot punodwon siun buisn auaadxa ou aey sioyne aul shop ui seap
canine acral lick dermatitis.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Capsaicin (8-methyl N-vanillyl-6-noneamide) is a compound obtained from red
 peppers. The rationale for using topical capsaicin is related to its effect on sub-
stance P. an endogenous undecapeptide widely distributed in afferent sensory
fibers. Substance P is a neurotransrmitter and transmits the pain and itch sensa-
-iposea juajod e osje s!ll watsAs snoaiau jeinuan aul ot Aiaydjuad ayr wony suon
lator, and it may be the vasoactive substance responsible for the axon-reflex
vasodilation or flare. Repeated local applications of capsaicin have been demon-
strated to deplete substance P from peripheral sensory neurons, and then block
further synthesis and transport of substance P within the neuron, preventing its
 adh papeuawun uo Aediouud ioe ot sieadde upiesdey uoeinwnooe-al
sensations. The alkaloid does not appear to act directly on central cells in the
spinal cord and brain.
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
As the duration of action of capsaicin is short, the recommendation is to apply
a thin layer of the product 3-5 times daily for at least 4 weeks before any ben-
efit can be noted. Capsaicin should not be applied on eroded or ulcerated
skin surfaces. Therefore, it is important to make sure any eroded or ulcerated
area, typically present in acral lick dermatitis, is resolved before starting capsai-
cin therapy.
PRECAUTIONSIADVERSE EFFECTS
 The following adverse reactions have been reported in people. Application-site
adverse effects such as erythema, pain, edema, pruritus, local discomfort (burm-
ing. stinging) are common. Local discomfort and pain occur more frequently if
the product is applied less than three times daily. Coughing, sneezing, and short-
ness of breath have been reported with inhalation of airborme capsaicin
capsaicin. Avoid contact with mmucosal surfaces and eroded or ulcerated skin.

Dimethyl Sulfoxide
INDICATIONS
hn small animal veterinary dermatology. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used
primarily as an adjunctive therapy for acral lick dermatitis, hyperplastic otitis
externa, and calcinosis cutis. It is combined with a glucocorticoid ± a non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of acral lick dermatitis and
MECHANISM OF ACTION
DMSo is an organosulfur compound with various pharmacologic effects. It
scavenges  free-radical hydroxide. and  the metabolite dimethyl disulfide
scavenges free-radical oxygen. These actions help to explain some of the anti-
inflammatory. anti-ischemic, cryopreservative, and radioprotective effects of
DMSO. It also has antibacterial (weak) and antifungal properties. The anti-
inflammatory effect of DMso is greater when it is used for acute rather than
dhronic inflammation. DMSo has an unique property of penetrating the skin and
mucosa easily. and has been used as a drug delivery system.
366
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGES
For acral lick dermatitis, the combination of DMSO and fluocinolone acetonide
(Synotic) with or without the addition of flunixin meglumine (Banamine?) is
typically applied 2-3 times daily with the qoal of reducing the associated fibrosis
and inflarmation. For hyperplastic otitis extema, Synotic is commonly used 2-3
times daily or as indicated to reduce the hyperplasia. It is important to note that
DMSo is only part of the treatment regimen for these conditions. The use of
DMSO to treat calcinosis cutis is anecdotal and erpirical at this time. The recom-
mendation is to apply the medical-grade product to one-third of the affected
area daily until resolution of clinical signs. To the authors' knowledge, there are
no reports demonstrating that the topical use of DMSo in conjunction with the
adequate treatment of hyperadrenocorticism (most common cause of calcinosis
cutis in dogs) accelerates the resolution of lesions.
PRECAUTIONS/ADＶERSE EFFECTS
DMSO is a very safe drug when used as labeled. Local skin reactions are possible
It can also be irritating to the mucosal membranes. Reversible ocular lens changes
have been noted in laboratory animals when DMSo is used long-term and at
high doses. Garlic or oyster-like breath odor is very common when administering
DMSO. It is recommended to wear gloves when applying DMSO-containing
products. Monitor serum Ca++ concentration once a month during treatment of
calcinosis cutis, as hypercalcemia may occur.

Sunscreen
INDICATIONS
Sunscreens are used to protect depigmented or lightly pigmented, thin-haired or
alopecic skin surfaces against principally UVB damage.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
UVB radiation (wavelength: 290-320nm) causes sunburms, malignancies, and
tanning. whereas UVA radiation (wavelength: 320-4o0 nm) causes tanning and
may act with UvB radiation to promote malignancies. Sunscreens act mostly by
uoeipei An jo ,uodiosge, pue ,buuaess, sassanaud om
Physical sunscreen formulations form an opaque coating on the skin surface
(e.g.. zinc oxide paste), scattening or reflecting the UV energy away from its
original path and thereby preventing or mminimizing sunburns, photo-aging. and
tanning. Non-opaque products that include particulate sunscreens such as tita-
nium oxide and zinc oxide will also have the same effect.
Chemical sunscreens absorb UV energy by incorporating the energy into the
electron stnucture of the sunscreen molecule. This often results in re-radiation of
the energy as infrared radiation (heat), which has a less damaging wavelength
The physical sunscreens can also absorb UV energy.
Most commercially available products will combine two or more active sun-
 5creen ingredients. Products with a sun protection factor (SPF) > 30 typically have
better protection, because many of their ingredients have some UvA radiation
absorption. Concentrations of active ingredients correlate directly with the spec-
trum of action of the product. SPF value is not allowed on labels of pet products
SUGGESTED USES/DOSAGE
Apply to the desired area(s) before sun exposure and reapply every 1-2 hours a5
needed. Do not allow the animal to lick at the applied site(s) for at least 20-30
minutes after application, to avoid ingestion and allow the product to work

HUMAN-LABELED SUNSCREEN PRODUCTS
There are various human sunscreen products available OTC. Children's sunscreen
may be used on dogs and cats in the absence of veterinary products. As there are
products formulated and labeled for animal use, human products are not listed
here. For mmore information on these products, refer to a comprehensive human
drug reference (e.g.. Micromedex) or contact a pharmacist.
OTIC PREPARATIONS
While not a cormplete list, the following examples are representative of the topi-
Gal otic preparations available to the veterinarian. Products listed may be availa-
ble over the counter (OTC), may require prescription, or may be sold only through
Icensed veterinarians. Refer to the product label before using any product.
General information
t is important to demonstrate to clients the ear-cleaning technique and the
administration of topical otic medications when treating ear diseases. Advise
dients to discontinue the product application and contact a veterinarian if the
ears become redder or more inflamed at any time during the course of cleaning
or treatment, as local cutaneous adverse reactions may occur
When treating infectious otitis, antibiotic and/or antifungal topical medica-
tions should be administered at least twice daily in order to be effective. It is very
important to recheck the patient before discontinuing treatment of otitis, as the
medication(s) should be administered until 1-2 weeks after a negative cytology
and/or ear culture, depending on the infectious microorganism(s) present and
the patient's history. Wwhen using topical steroids to reduce otic hyperplasia and
stenosis, 1-4 times daily applications may be used. The frequency and duration
of ear cleaning varies according to the needs of the individual patient.
Adverse effects associated with ear cleaning and ear medications can include
maceration, contact reactions, otitis media, ear canal avulsion, Hormer's syn-
drome, facial nerve paralysis, and variable signs of ototoxicity including deafness
and vestibular symptoms (e.g.. ataxia, nystagmus, head tilt).
Ototoxicity
Ototoxicity is defined as a harmful effect of a medication on the eighth cranial
nerve or the organs of hearing and balance. The absence or rupture/perforation
of the tympanic membrane can allow potentially ototoxic topical medications to
reach the inner ear and cause toxicity. The incidence of ototoxicity in dogs and
cats is unknown.
It is documented that more than 5o% of dogs with chronic ear disease have
absent or ruptured tympanic membrane (Cole et ar. 1998), and considering that
most cases of ear disease in dogs and cats are treated topically, veterinarians
should be farmiliar with the ototopical drugs that are considered safe or poten-
tially ototoxic.
In dogs and cats, ototoxic signs are often subtle and not detected until severe
damage to the sensorineural cells of the cochlea and vestibular apparatus has
aready occurred, resulting in deafness and vestibular signs (nystagmus, ataxia,
head tilt, etc.).
370
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
Most of the information available to veterinarians regarding ototoxicity
presumably associated with ear cleaners and medications is anecdotal or based
on humans or laboratory animal studies. Therefore, care should be taken when
extrapolating to dogs and cats information based on personal experience or
studies conducted in other species. In addition, the type of otic damage (e.g..
vestibular and/or auditory dysfunction such as hearing loss) and its correlation
with potentially ototoxic topical products is mostly speculative at this time
Disease duration may influence the absorption of otic products in the inner
ear. In the eany stages of otitis media the permeability of the round (cochlear)
window membrane increases; in contrast, as the disease becomes chronic.
thickening of the membrane is noted, preventing the penetration of ototoxic
substances into the inner ear. lnterestingly. some ototoxic medications are pro-
 inflarnmatory (see Table 2, below), causing thickening of the middle ear mucosa
and the membrane of the round window, which limits their absorption into the
inner ear (Gotthelf 2005)
Duration of therapy and age can influence the severity of nervous tissue dam-
age and the reversibility of ototoxic signs. It was previously shown in guinea pigs
that the degree of cochlear damage and hearing loss worsens as the duration of
neomycin application to the middle ear increases (Brummett et af. 1976). Young
animals seerm to be more sensitive to the ototoxicity of antibiotics (Gotthelf
2005). Neomycin was shown to be particularly ototoxic when used in the ears of
2- or 3-week-old kittens (Leake and Hradek 1988)
EAR ClEANERS, ANTISEPTiCS
There are rany ear cleaners available, and for most of therm there is no informa-
tion regarding safety for the ears of dogs and cats. One study carried out in dogs
and guinea pigs showed that among the ingredients tested (squalene, dyoctil
sodium succinate, carbamide peroxide, and triethanolamine). only squalene
caused no morphologic or neurologic abnormality after 4 weeks of treatment
based on brain auditory evoked response (BAER) test and neurologic examina-
tion (Mansfield et af. 1997)
Package inserts of chlorhexidine otic preparations advise against their use
when the possibility of tympanic mermbrane rupture exists. The ototoxicity
potential of chlorhexidine appears to differ according to its concentration.
Studies evaluating chlorhexidine ototoxicity in cats have shown pronounced
degeneration of cochlear and vestibular hair cells with 2% chlorhexidine gluco-
nate, and minor but repeatable intracellular abnormalities at 0.05%. However.
even with the most diluted chlorhexidine solution (0.05 %) there were still ves-
tibular signs (lgarashi and Suzuki 1985. lgarashi and Oka 1988). A study per-
formed in dogs with myringotomies showed that 0.2% chlorhexidine applied
twice daily in the ears for 21 days appears to be safe as an irigating solution for
the middle ear (Merchant et af. 1995). However, a more recent study showed
that chlorhexidine gluconate 0.5% solution and ethyl alcohol 70% in water, but
not povidone iodine 10% (equal to 1% iodine in aqueous solution), adminis-
tered topically in the middle ear of sand rats once daily for 5 consecutive days.
had a profound effect on both vestibular and cochlear functions (Perez et ar.
20oo). The authors recommend caution when using chlorhexidine solution at
any concentration in the ears of dogs and cats, particularly in those with
unknown status or rupture of tyrmpanic rembranes
Section 2: Topical Agents
371
Agents that are believed to be safe in dogs and cats for ear flushing in the
presence of ruptured tyrpanic merbrane include sterile water, sterile saline,
tris-EDTA, and possibly chlorhexidine at a concentration of less than 0.o5%
(Paterson 2oo8). Administration of ceruminolytic agents, except for squalene-
containing products, should be avoided in the middle ear and in cases with
unknown status or rupture of the tympanic membrane

safe in the middle ear, but not tincture of iodine, which contains alcohol (Gotthelf
2005). Therefore, propylene glycol- and alcohol-containing products should be
avoided if the status of the tympanic membrane cannot be determnined or if it is
uptured.
ANTIMICRGBIAL AGENtS
Aminoglycosides are believed to be ototoxic in humans by causing damage
initially to the hair cells of the cochlea, which later results in degeneration of
other cochlear structures (Huizing and de Groot 1987). There have been many
anecdotal reports of acute deafness in dogs associated with administration of
gentamicin-containing otic products. However, in a controlled study where a
low-dose aqueous gentarmicin solution (3 mg/mL) was applied directly into the
middle ear of 10 normal dogs twice daily for 21 days, there was no abnormal
effect on cochlear or vestibular functions (Strain et ar. 199 5). Additionally. a

damage (66% loss of cochlear hair cells) than gentamicin (6.5% loss) (Barlow
et ar. 1995). Gentamicin, neomycin, streptomycin, and kanamycin may be
slowly eliminated from the inner ear and cause delayed ototoxicity (Gotthelf
2005)
Cochlear damage, manifested as dramatic reduction in BAER testing. has been
shop jo siea ayn ui upeyiwe pue uosweigot jo uoedde jesidon yrm pauodai
(Paterson 2008). Cats appear to be more susceptible to arminoglycoside ototoxic-
ity than dogs.
Results of a retrospective study including 60 ears of dogs with ruptured
tympanic membranes, treated for 6-8 weeks with vanous medications, showed
that compared to baseline the mean BAER test scores increased with gentamicin
(8mL of injectable gentamicin [40mg/mL] mixed in 1 18mL of tnis-EDTA), silver
sulfadiazine cream (diluted 50:50 with sterile water), and marbofloxacin (5 mL of
the diluted 200 mg injectable solution mixed in 1 18 mL of tris-EDTA) (Nuttall and
Paterson 2oo8). On the other hand, there was reduction in the mean BAER
 scores for ears treated with ticarcillin (3.2 g of clavulanate-potentiated ticarcillin
njectable solution mixed with 6mL of sterile water) and tobramycin (2mL of
njectable tobramycin [40mg/mL] mixed with 8mL of tnis-EDTA). In this study.

Topical chloramphenicol has been shown to cause cochlear damage and
deafness in humans and laboratory animals (Morizono and Johnstone 1975.
        
 of chlorarmphenicol in dogs and cats is currently unknown.
Based on these studies, topical administration of aminoglycosides (including
gentamicin, amikacin, and tobramycin), polymyxin, and ticarcillin should be
avoided, or they should be used with caution, with ruptured or unknown-status
tympanic membrane until more information is obtained from further studies.
Antimicrobial medications that appear to be safe for the middle ear include
fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, ofloxacin), aqueou5
semisynthetic penicillins and some cephalosporins (ceftazidime, cefmenoxime),
and antifungals including clotrimazole, miconazole, nystatin, and tonalftate
(Paterson 2008)
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS
Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone and fluocinolone are believed to be safe
for use in the middle ear (Paterson 2oo8). However, a combination of fluo-
plastic and inflamed ears, may not be safe for administration in the ear if the
tympanic membrane is ruptured due to the potential ototoxicity of DMSO
ANTIPARASITIC AGENTS
To the authors' knowledge there are no studies in anirmals reporting the poten-
tial for ototoxicity of antiparasitic ototopical medications cormmonly used in dogs
and cats. Therefore, caution should be taken when administering these drugs to
ears with tympanic membranes that are ruptured or of unknown status
The following tables, slightly modified from Gotthelf (2005),. show a list of
ototopical agents believed to be safe (Table 1) and potentially ototoxic (Table 2)
for the middle ear. Please note that most of the reported drugs in these tables
have been extrapolated from studies conducted in humans or laboratory ani-
 mals; therefore, the true safety or ototoxicity potential for most of these drugs i5
not yet proven in dogs and cats
Until more is known about the ototoxicity potential of vanious topical agents
used in dogs and cats, veterinarians should (1) read the entire label of ear
medications and cleaners prior to use; (2) detemmine the status of the tympanic
membranes; and (3) use caution when selecting ototopical medications and ear
cleaners to be used directly in the middle ear. Patients should be closely monitored
during treatment with ototopical medications for early identification of toxic
effects, which can avoid irreversible darmage.

Ceruminolytic Agents
Ceruminolytic products emulsify and remove ceruminous and purulent exudate
by providing a surfactant, detergent, and bubbling activity. They may be indicated
for removal of ceruminoliths prior to considering ear flushing under anesthesia.
They work best if applied 10-15 minutes prior to cleaning. If they are needed
during in-hospital ear-flushing procedures, their use should be followed by
multiple flushes with warm sterile isotonic saline. Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate
(DSS), calcium sulfosuccinate, urea, or carbamide peroxide are considered potent
ceruminolytic agents. Squalene, triethanolarmine polypeptide elite condensate.
and hexamethyltetracosane are less potent agents. Propylene glycol, glycerin,
and oil are considered very mild ceruminolytic agents. Urea peroxide-containing
 products will release oxygen when activated and produce a foaming action that
helps break down cerumen. These products, however, can be irritating to already
inflarmed ears. It is important to demonstrate the cleaning technique in the
examination room and advise the client to discontinue application and contact
 the veterinarian if the ears become redder or more inflamed at any time during
the course of cleaning. The frequency of cleaning varies according to the needs
of the individual patient.

Cleaning/Drying Agents
Cleaning and drying agents are typically used after debris or exudate has been
removed from the ear canals with a cenuminolytic agent. Their ingredients are
usually an acid or isopropy alcohol. Cleaning and drying ear solutions can be
used on a maintenance regimen to help prevent ear infections and after bathing
or swimming to keep the external ear canals water-free. When recommending
ear flushing as part of the treatment regimen, it is important to demonstrate the
cleaning technique in the examination room and advise the client to discontinue
application and contact the veterinarian if the ears becorme redder or more
inflamed at any time during the course of cleaning. The frequency of cleaning
varies according to the needs of the individual patient.

Antiseptic Agents
Topical antiseptic ear flushes include products containing acetic acid, chlorhex-
idine, ketoconazole, and hypochlorous acid. These products are typically used as
adjunctive therapy for ear infections (e.g. bacterial and/or yeast) but can also be
used as sole treatment in mild. first-time infections. Acetic acid works as an
acidifying and antimicrobial agent.
Chlorhexidine has activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
and fungi. Products containing chlorhexidine should be used cautiously in ear
canals with ruptured tympanic membranes because of the potential for ototoxic-
ity. Chloroxylenol is mostly active against bacteria. Ketoconazole is a fungistatic
antifungal that interferes with the synthesis of ergosterol, an esential compo-
nent of the fungal cell membrane, by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 CYP51
380
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
(lanesterol C 14-demethylase). Hypochlorous acid is a broad-spectrum antimicro-
bial with rapid activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and
fungal/yeast organisms. Its mode of action against microorganisms mimics that
of neutrophils in the body. The main route of attack against microorganisms is
disruption of the cellular membrane.
When recommending ear flushing as part of the treatment regimen, it is
important to demonstrate the cleaning technique in the examination room and
advise the client to discontinue application and contact the veterinarian if the
ears become redder or more inflamed at any time duning the course of cleaning.
The frequency of cleaning varies according to the needs of the individual patient.

Antibiotic Potentiating Agents
Tris-ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (tris-EDTA) has an antimicrobial and anti-
biotic potentiating activity. It is alkalinizing (pH 8), blocks the Pseudomonas
disrupts the bactenial cell wall by chelating metal ions and making it more porous
(most efficient for Gram-negative bacteria such as Aseudomonas), inhibits the
effects of ulcerating bacterial enzymes, and is non-ototoxic (safe in the middle
ear). Products containing tris-EDTA work best when applied 15-30 minutes
before the topical antibiotic. These products are available as sole ingredient or
combined with chlorhexidine or ketoconazole
When recommending ear flushing as pairt of the treatment regimen, it is
important to demonstrate the cleaninq technigue in the examination room and
advise the client to discontinue application and contact the veterinanian if the
ears become redder or more inflamed at any time during the course of cleaning

Corticosteroid Preparations
Referalsoto Corticosteroid+AntimicrobialPreparations
Corticosteroid-containing ear medications are used in cases of acute or chronic
otitis with the goal of reducing inflammation, edema, tissue hyperplasia, stenosis
of the ear canal, pain and pruritus. In addition, they are efficacious in decreasing
secretion from sebaceous, and ceruminous glands reducing the build up of
debris in the ear canals. Ear cleaning solutions that contain glucocorticoids with-
out an antibiotic can be used as maintenance therapy in cases of allergic otitis.
However, use the lowest potent glucocorticoid at the lowest possible frequency
to prevent undesirable side effects. Wwhen using topical corticosteroids to reduce
otic hyperplasia and stenosis, 1-4 times daily applications may be used according
to each individual's need.

AntibioticFormulations
Antibacterial ear preparations are commonly used to treat infections caused
by bacteria such as Staphyiococcus or Pseudomonas. Very few otic products
containing solely an antibiotic are commercially available to treat bacterial otitis;
therefore, the clinician often has to use ophthalmic products or injectable antibi-
otics directly into the ear canals to treat these infections when other active ingre-
dents are not desired or bacteria are resistant to the commercially available
products. Vhen using acidifying ear cleansers and treating an infection with an
arninoglycoside- or fluoroquinolone-containing agent, it is recommended to use
these products about 1 hour apart, since low pH can decrease the activity of
aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. Bacterial culture and susceptibility should
be performed to select the ideal antibiotic, particularly to treat any case of
Peudomonas ear infection. The product has to be applied 2-3 times daily in
adequate amounts to coat the entire ear canal. Advise the client to discontinue
the medication and contact the veterinarian if the ears become redder or more

Compounded Antibiotic Preparations
The use of these compounded preparations for the treatment of ear infections is
extra-label and based on anecdotal reports. Several different formulations may
be reported for a certain drug. and currently there is no accurate information on
how they compare in terms of efficacy and safety. Despite lack of scientific evi-
dence on their use for otic diseases, these preparations are included here because
they are becoming commonly used by dermatologists with the increase in anti-
biotic resistance and limited availability of commercial ototopical preparations.
These medications may be particularly useful for the treatment of resistant
bacterial otic infections such as those caused by Pseudomonas and methicillin-
lesistant Staphylococcus.
392
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
The authors recommend that the injectable antibiotics be used based on
culture and sensitivity results. However, it is important to remember that antibi-
otic sensitivity of samples collected from the ear canals is based on antibiotic
serum concentration and not concentration in the ear tissue. Also, topical medi-
cations in the ear canals may be effective despite reported resistance, as the
antibiotic concentration in the ear is reported to be 1ooo times higher than in
the serum. Adverse cutaneous reactions and ototoxicity may occur. Use of inject-
able antibiotics in the ears may be very expensive.

Allergen-Specific
Immunotherapy
Definition
According  to the World  Health Organization (WHO). allergen-specific
immunotherapy (ASIT), also known as hyposensitization, desensitization, or 
allergy shots, “"is the practice of adninistering graduall increasing quantities of
an allergen extract to an allergic subject to ameliorate the symptoms of
subsequent exposure to the causative allergen" (Bousquet et ar. 1998). In
veterinary medicine, ASIT is the only specific therapy for atopic dermatitis (AD)
and is established based on relevant allergens that have been identified according
 to the results of intradermal testing and/or in-vitro allergy serum testing.
Indications
ASIT is indicated for dogs and cats with seasonal or year-round AD after
identification of relevant allergens based on intradermal and/or allergy serum
testing: for cases where allergen exposure is unavoidable; and when all
symptomatic therapeutic trials have been ineffective or have been associated
with unacceptable side effects. Moreover, prior to starting the treatment, the
owner should be willing to administerinjections and acceptthe time commitment,
mainly during the initial phase. Due to its mode of action, ASIT is the only
therapeutic intervention that has the potential to prevent the development of
dinical signs and alter the long-terrn course of AD. Therefore, ideally, allergy
testing and ASIT should be recommended early during the course of AD, but

administration of glucocorticoids or cyclosporine, which is often associated with
undesirable side effects. In addition, compared to many therapies commonly
used for AD, ASIT is typically more cost-effective over tirme, mainly for large

Mechanism of Action
The mechanism of action of ASIT is very complex and not well understood.
In humans treated with ASiT, numerous changes in cellular and humoral
include alterations in T-helper cell response such as increased ratio of allergen-

as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta; increase in
IgG1 and lgG4 production; decrease in allergen-specific IgE production and
suppression of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. None of the in-vitro assay
results in humans has correlated completely with a patient's favorable clinical
response to ASIT
There are few studies in dogs and cats reporting changes in cellular and
humoral responses associated with ASIT. There seems to be a shift to a Th1
response by enhancing interferon-gamma expression (Shida et ar. 2oo4) and a
significant increase in both T-regulatory cell numbers and IL-10 concentration5
after successful ASIT (Keppel et af. 2oo8). In a study of experimental feline
asthrma, cats receiving rush immunotherapy (RIT) showed a decrease of IL-4 and
 IL-5 in the broncheoalveolar lavage fluid and an increase in interferon-gamma
and IL-10 transcription (Reinero et af. 2006)
ASIT has been reported in different studies to increase total IgG serum
antibody concentrations, more specifically serum lgG1, in dogs with AD
(Hite5 et ar. 1989. Foster et ar. 2002. Fraser et af. 2004): however, these
findings are controversial regarding correlation between serum IgG increase
and the degree of clinical response. In cats with experimental allergic asthma,
RIT induced an increase in specific IgG antibodies to Bermuda grass allergen5

Precautions and Contraindications
ASIT should not be used in patients with a previous history of severe adverse
reactions to ASIT. Avoidance or caution should be taken if administering ASIT to
patients that developed an allergic or anaphylactic reaction to allergens
administered during an intradermal test.
Clinical Efficacy
ASIT has been used by many veterinarians and dermatologists for many years,
and it is considered by most to be the mainstay treatment of AD. Different ASIT
reviews and recent therapeutic guidelines for AD suggest a probable beneficial
effect of ASIT for the management of canine and feline AD (Griffin and Hillier
2001, Loewenstein and Muller 2009, Olivry et af. 2010a, 2010b). In addition,
 based on open uncontrolled studies, the reported success rates for ASIT in dogs
and cats with AD range from 50% to 100% and 50% to 75%, respectively
(Loewenstein and Muller 2o09), with efficacy being described as at least 50%
improverment in clinical signs and/or a decrease in the dosage or frequency of
concurrent anti-inflarnmatory or antipruritic medications. This wide range of
response seems to be influenced by variation among the different studies
regarding allergy testing methodology, allergen selection, dose and concentration
of allergens, protocol and response critena, among other factors. Finally, because
of insufficient numbers of randomized, controlled clinical studies, the true
efficacy of AsiT in dogs and cats is cumently unknown
Section 3: Allergen-Specific Immunotherapy
397
Anecdotal and open-label studies have shown that some predictive factors
such as age of the dog at disease onset, age of the dog at ASiT initiation,
duration of allergy symptoms, dog breed and sex, and seasonality of clinical sign5
can influence the clinical outcome of ASIT (Griffin and Hillier 2oo1, Loewenstein
and Muller 2oo9). However, results from these studies have been conflicting. and
aurrently there is more evidence showing that these factors most likely do not
sgnificantly interfere with the success rate of ASiT. Another predictive factor
reported to possibly influence the outcome of ASIT is the number of allergens
the patient is allergic to and included in the ASiT, with controversial results
among different reports (Scott 1981, WWalton Angorano and MacDonald 1991).
However, more recent reports indicated no correlation between number of
allergens used and efficacy of AST (Nuttall 1998, Schnabl et ar. 2006)
There are conflicting results regarding the response to specific types of
allergens selected for ASIT in veterinary medicine, with sorme studies reporting
better response to pollens than to other allergens and others showing no
dfference among different allergens used, such as pollens and house-dust mites
(Loewenstein and Muller 2oo9). Therefore, further studies are needed to
outcome in dogs and cats.
Based on anecdotal reports and the authors' experiences, some animals

Time to Efficacy and Duration of Therapy
Currenty, the time to obtain maximal clinical efficacy and the ideal duration of
up to 12 months to achieve maximal benefit, with initial improvement usually
seen after 2-9 months of therapy in dogs. and 1-4 months in cats (Loewenstein
and Muller 2009). Therefore, because of a possible delayed response, ASIT should
be continued for at least 1 year before critically evaluating clinical efficacy.
Typically, most dermatologists recornrmend life-long treatment with ASIT when
there is clinical response. However, open controlled studies with unspecified or
variable follow-up periods showed sustained clinical irprovement after discon-
tinuation of ASIT in 4-35% of the dogs (Loewenstein and Muller 2009). There
are no reports in cats regarding efficacy of ASIT after treatrment discontinuation.
Allergen Selection
Similarly to what is reported in humans, the clinical response to ASIT in dogs and
Gats seems to be allergen-specific. Allergen selection should therefore be as
accurate as possible. Allergens to be included in the ASIT should be selected
based on the patient's clinical history, including allergen exposure and results of

efficacy between ASiT based on intradermal and allergy serum testing (Griffin
and Hillier 2001). However, controlled studies need to be conducted to deter-
mine the ideal allergy test methodology for formulation of ASIT

more slowly absorbed, requiring larger doses but fewer injections. There have
been concerms regarding possible carcinogenic effects of alum-precipitated

Cross-reactivity may be important in allergen selection for ASiT in dogs and
cats, as it can potentially help simplify formulation practices and reduce inventory
requirerments by reducing the number of allergens included; however, most of
the information used is extrapolated from humans (Esch 2008). Usually cross-
reactivity is present within the same family or closer relationships, so that species

farmily. Grass antigens tend to be the most cross-reactive, as they have fewer
families; however, the three main grass families do not often cross-react. Weeds
are less cross-reactive than grasses, and tree antigens are the least cross-reactive.
Companies providing allergens for AsiT can assist veterinarians with information
 regarding potential cross-reactivity among different allergen5.
compatibility of allergen mixtures. Two problems that may occur with allergen
mixtures are excessive dilution due to large numbers of allergens in the mixture
leading to suboptimal dosing. and more rapid allergen deterioration and loss of
allergenicity as a result of the enzymatic activity of some allergen extracts. In
humans, allergen extracts containing high concentrations of proteolytic enzymes,
such as mmold and insect extracts, have been implicated in reducing the potency
of allergen mixtures and ultimately interfering with their efficacy when they
are stored in the sarme vial, with grass pollens being among the most su5-
ceptible to proteolytic effects (Esch 2o08). Most dogs with AD exhibit
multiple hypersensitivities; therefore, allergen mixtures are often prescribed.
The degradation of pollen allergens by mold proteases has also been reported in
veterinary medicine (Rosenbaum et al. 1996). In addition, it has been shown that
the success rate of ASiT increases with separation of mold allergens from other
types of allergens (Mueller and Bettenay 1996). However, the true significance
 of allrgen mixture and degradation on ASIT clinical response in dogs and cats is

Administration Route
In dogs and cats, subcutaneous injections are the standard route of administra-
tion of ASIT. Injections are usually adrninistered in the nape of the neck. It is
helpful to alternate injection sites so that the same site is not repeatedly injected
Oral or sublingual immunotherapy, using a different allergen formulation than
those used subcutaneously. has recently been investigated in dogs. A preliminary
open study investigated the clinical response of 10 mite-sensitive dogs with AD

to sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) (DeBoer et al. 201Oa). Treatment consisted
of O.1mL of allergen solution of increasing concentrations administered
sublingually twice daily for 6 months. Concurrently, all dogs were treated with
decreasing doses of oral methylprednisolone tapered to a minimum required
dose. This study showed significant improvement in pruritus and clinical scores
Four of 10 dogs did not require oral glucocorticoid administration after 6 months
of immunotherapy. In a separate report, mite-specific lgE and IgG levels in serial
serurm saimples from the same mite-sensitive dogs were assayed by ELISA over
the course of 6 months (DeBoer et ai. 2010b). Median Demmatophagoides
farinae-specific IgE levels declined significantly. while the median D. farinae-
specific lgG levels increased, which generally correlated with successful SLIT
Conversely. another pilot placebo-controlled study using experimental atopic
beagles showed that oral administration of 10mg of D. farinae culture, mixed
with cream cheese (applied inside the cheeks and on the hard palate), once daily
for 7 months was safe but did not induce a significant decrease in clinical sign5
or allergen-specific IgE (Marsella 2010)
 It is currently unknown if oral or sublingual immunotherapy would work in
dogs that had not responded to conventional AsIT. Further studies are needed to
investigate the efficacy of oral or sublingual immunotherapy in dogs with AD. To
date, oral and sublingual allergen formulations are not commercially available
for use in dogs.
Allergen Vials and Treatment Protocols
There are many commercial companies that supply allergens for intradermal
testing and ASIT. For those veterinarians initiating the practice of ASIT, the
authors recommend consulting a dermatologist for suggestions of which
company to use. Companies that provide allergens for ASiT usually supply the
allergens in 2-3 vials. The recommended number of allergens per vial may vary
according to the allergen provider and dermatology practice, but usually no
more than 12 allergens should be included per vial to avoid over-dilution of
concentration of allergens mixed in a diluent or adjuvant, and it is often known
2s allergen solution. The patient is started on the most diluted allergen solution.
and the allergen concentration is gradualy increased to minimize the risk of
adverse effects and achieve the desirable maintenance dose.
To date, the optimal allergen concentration for ASiT in veterinary medicine has
 not been identified. The initial concentration used may vary. but it is typically
between 200 and 20o0 PNU/mL (see chart below). The maintenance vial usually
has a total allergen solution of 10,000-20,000 PNU/mL. Overall, the allergen
amount injected at the initial loading phase varies from 0.05 to 1 mL, while the
maintenance dose is typically 1 mL. A recent prospective double-blinded study in
dogs found no significant difference between effectiveness of ASIT given at a
bw dose (0. 1 mL) compared to the standard dose (1.0 mL) (Colombo et al. 2005).
Allergen manufacturers usually  suggest a protocol; however, many
dermatologists develop their own protocols. There are numerous ASIT protocols
being used, with no standardization described for dogs and cats. Some protocols
are based on body weight, and differ for small (≤20Ib) and large dogs (> 20 Ib)
(Scott et al. 2oo 1). The optimal dosing interval for both loading and maintenance

require injections more frequently than every 10 days are usually given smaller
volumes of allergens.

All protocols should be considered a starting point, and, in order to maximize
the efficacy of ASIT, adjustments should be made according to each individual
response. Thus, injection frequency and dose of allergen solution may be
modified according to the patient's requirerments. Experience with the patient
allows the owner and the veterinarian to estimate how frequently the injections

immunotherapy (RIT), which is based on a short and intensive protocol of ASIT
The RT uses a shorter initial loading phase, advancing the patient to the

benefits of such a protocol include the potential to obtain a clinical response
sooner and avoid the frequent injections given initially by the owners. ln dogs.
one protocol using aqueous allergens involves subcutaneously administering
increasing doses of allergens every 30 minutes for 7 hours (Mueller et al. 2004).
Dogs are usually premedicated with an antihistamine for a few days prior to the
RT. An intravenous catheter is placed prior to the first allergen injection for
administration of emergency drugs if needed. Dogs are monitored for side
effects, with vital signs being evaluated frequently. Dogs are then discharged and
continue on maintenance immunotherapy athome. A double-blinded randomized
study in dogs with AD showed that RIT seems to be safe and associated with a
higher success rate than conventional ASiT over a 1z-month period, with
improvement seen within the first 6 months of therapy (Mueller et af. 2o04)
However, further studies are needed to support or dispute these findings

allergens are administered subcutaneously at increasing doses every 30 minutes
for 5 hours to a maintenance dose of 15,000 PNU/mL (Trimmer et al. 2005).
However, there are no reports on the efficacy of RIT in atopic cats
Adverse Effects
Adverse reactions to conventional AsiT are reported to be rare to uncommon
in dogs. The most common adverse event reported in dogs is pruritus (reported
in about 25% of dogs) and exacerbation of clinical signs after administration
of increasing concentrations of ASiT. Localized injection-site reactions are

(Griffin and Hillier 2oo1). Anaphylaxis. although rare, is the most serious

There is very little infommation regarding ASIT adverse reactions in cats, with
 bcalized injection-site reactions, pruritus, and fatal anaphylaxis being anecdo-
tally reported. Most adverse reactions occur immediately after an injection or up
to 1-2 days later, and can persist for hours to days
Pre-treatment with antihistarmines or glucocorticoids, 1-2 hours prior to each
allergen injection, is anecdotally reported in dogs and cats to prevent adverse
leactions and recommended by the authors, mainly when administering more
than 12-15 allergens. Factors influencing adverse effects of ASIT in dogs and
cats have not been investigated.
 RIT and oral or sublingual inrnunotherapy are reported to be generally safe in
dogs and cats. Intradermal administration of allergen solution in 30 dogs with

performed in 12 dogs with AD, did not show any side effects of RIT when
administered subcutaneously (Mueller et af. 2o04). One pilot study investigating
the safety of RIT in atopic cats reported that two of four cats developed mild
increase in grooming behavior, which was interpreted as mild pruritus, during
the rapid loading phase, and two others developed derrmal swelling at injection
site 1 week after RIT (Trimmer et al. 2005)
 Studies investigating oral or sublingual imrmunotherapy in dogs did not report
any side effects (DeBoer et al. 2010a, 2010b)
 Despite the uncommon to rare adverse reactions associated with conventional
ASIT or RIT, it is important to ask clients to observe the pet closely for about
2 hours after administering the allergen solution, and to seek appropriate
veterinary care if required.
Concurrent Therapy and Drug Interactions
There have been conflicting opinions regarding the influence of glucocorticoids
on the outcome of ASIT, with some dermatologists suggesting avoidance during

used at low doses or on alternate days (Loewenstein and Muller 2oo9)
Cyclosporine was shown to not interfere with intraderrmal or senum allergen-
specific lgE reactivity when administered orally at 5mg/kg/day for 30 days
(Goldman et af. 2010). However, the effect of cyclosporine on the response
 to ASIT is currently unknown. Basically, there is no current evidence to suggest
that concurrent administration of any topical or systemic anti-inflammatory/
immunomodulatory drugs alters the clinical benefit of ASIT in dogs and cat5

needed, to maintain good quality of life until ASIT is reported to be effective. It is
 possible that concurrent administration of anti-inflarmmatory/immunormodulatory
drugs could mask evaluation of the clinical response to ASIT and its adverse
effects that would require modification of the ASIT protocol, mainly when used
during the induction phase
Client Education
Client education is a very irmportant aspect of ASIT administration. Prior to
starting ASiT therapy, clients should be aware of the technique, reported success
rate, and duration of ASIT, in addition to the cost and time commitment involved.
The recommended protocol and how to administer the injections should be
explained in detail. After drawing the solution, clients should allow the solution
to reach room terperature prior to administration. They should also be informed
about using new syringes and needles for each injection, and disposing of them
properly.
It is very important to teach clients to train their pets to accept the allergy
shots. Rewards should be given after each injection. The training is especially
 helpful when owners are nervous, as anirmals will often sense this apprehension.
Clients should be well informed about potential side effects and receive
Section 3: Allergen-SpecificImmunotherapy
403
recommendations for what to do in case they occur. If clients understand the
importance of following ASiT recommendations and have frequent communi-
Gation and follow-up visits during the first year of therapy. they will likely be
more compliant.
Recheck Evaluations and Monitoring
Frequent follow-up visits and monitoring of patients during ASIT is crucial to
maximize the potential benefits of ASIf. If possible, re-evaluation of patients at
1. 3, 6, and 12 months after starting ASIT can be helpful to try to reach optimal 
lesults. At these visits, veterinarians can modify ASIT protocols according to the
patient's response and occurrence of adverse effects, and can check compliance,
as compliance with ASIT by dog owners has been reported to be low. Additionally
complicating factors often associated with atopic demmatitis, such as skin and
ear infections, are likely to recur and should be appropriately addressed at these
follow-up visits

IDIOPATHIC STERILE PYOGRANULOMATOUS-GRANULOMATOUS
SYNDROME
Idiopathic sterile pyogranulomatous-granulomatous syndrome is an inflamma-
tory skin disease believed to be irmmune-mediated; however, the pathogenesis is
unknown. It is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats. Clinical signs are character-
ized by non-painful and non-pruritic, firmn, dermal plaques and/or nodules that
may be alopecic and ulcerated. Lesions may wax and wane, and occur anywhere
on the body, but most commonly on the muzzle, around the eyes, and on the
pinnae and feet.

JUVENILE CELLULITIS
Juvenile cellulitis is also known as juvenile sterile granulomatous dermatitis and
ymphadenitis. juvenile pyodema, or puppy strangles. It is an uncommon
inflarmmatory skin disease of dogs affecting mostly puppies 3 weeks to 4 months
od, with highest incidence in golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, dachshunds,
pointers, and Lhasa apsos. The etiology is unknown but it is believed to be
immune-mediated. The disease is characterized by acute swelling, sterile papules
pustules, crusts, draining tracts, and/or small ulcers on the muzzle and perioculan
areas with marked submandibular and prescapular lymphadenopathy. Exudative
otitis exterma, fever, anorexia, and depression may be present

REACTIVE HISTIOCYTOSIS
Cutaneous and systemic histiocytosis are uncommon reactive inflammatory skin
diseases derived from dermal dendritic cells. The etiology is unknown but it is
believed to be irmmune-mediated. The breed predilection (most commonly
Bermese mountain dog. rottweiler, boxer, golden retriever, and Labrador
retriever) suggests a genetic predisposition. Both conditions usually affect adult
head, neck, and extremities. Lesions may be alopecic, erythematous, and
usually non-painful and non-pruritic. Cutaneous histiocytosis may wax and
wane, and it may spontaneously resolve. Systemic histiocytosis carries a worse
prognosis, as it may also involve the conjunctiva, sclera, retrobulbar tissue5,
nasal cavity. lymph nodes, and internal organs such as the liver, spleen, lungs,
and bone marrow.

SYSTEMIC FUNGAL DISEASES
Systemic mycotic infections caused by pathogenic organisms often affect
the skin, and these include blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis,
Canine and Feline Dermatology Drug Handbook
histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis. Except for Sporothrix schenckii, which
invades the organism via cutaneous inoculation or wound contamination, the
infection typically occurs through inhalation of the vegetative form of the
fungus, which lives under special conditions in the environment. The only one
considered a true zoonosis is sporotrichosis. Cutaneous manifestations can vairy
but they typically include multi-focal nodules/plaques that eventually become
eroded to ulcerated and may drain a sanguineous-purulent exudate. Systemic
signs will differ according to the intermal organ affected, and non-organ-specific
signs include fever and decreased appetite or anorexia.

Endocrine Skin Disorders
CANINE ALOPECIA X
 Alopecia X is a non-inflammatory alopecia that typically affects intact male dogs
between 2 and 5 years of age. The cause of this disease is still unknowin.
 Pomeranians are over-represented, but Alaskan malarmutes, miniature poodles,
akitas, chow chows, keeshonds, Siberian huskies, and samoyeds also appear to
be predisposed. Clinical signs are lirmited tothe skin and include non-inflarnratory
alopecia that gradually progresses to affect the neck, the trunk, and the caudal
and lateral aspects of the hind legs and tail. Hyperpigrnentation and scaling are
also often present, and dogs may develop secondary bacterial and/or yeast
infections at any time during the disease course

CANINE HYPERADRENGCORTICISM
Hyperadrenocorticism can be spontaneous or the result of inappropriate use
of glucocorticoid therapy (iatrogenic). Most cases of spontaneous hyper-
adrenocorticism in dogs are due to a functional pituitary tumor (85 %), with fewer
cases caused by an adrenal tumor (15%). The iatrogenic form can affect dogs of
any age: however, the spontaneous disease typically affects middle-aged to old
dogs. Clinical signs include polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, panting. muscle

coint during the disease course, and bacterial and/or fungal skin infections or
demodicosis may also complicate the disease. Surgery can be performed to
lemove the adrenal or pituitary tumor; however, most patients receive medical
treatrment because in general they are not good candidates for surgery there is
currently limited experience of performing pituitary surgeries, and the efficacy of
the currently available medical therapies is very good.

CANINE HYPOTHYROIDISM
The most common causes of canine hypothyroidism are lymphocytic thyroiditis
or idiopathic atrophy of the thyroid parenchyma. The disease progresses insidi-
ously; therefore, middle-aged to old dogs are most commonly affected. Various
breeds have been reported as predisposed to primary hypothyroidism, and sight
hounds have been shown to have thyroid hormone concentrations below labo-
atory reference intervals. Clinical signs are non-specific and include lethargy.

Keratinization Disorders
ACNE
Acne is a poorly understood keratinization disorder of the hair follicles that
occurs more often in cats than in dogs. Hyperplasia of sebaceous glands is also
seen histologically in feline cases. Feline acne is characterized cinically by the
presence of comedones and/or black keratinous debris on the chin and lips.
Comedonic hair follicles can become inflamed and infected, resulting in the
development of papules, smmall nodules, and/or draining tracts as a result of rup-
ture of hair follicles (furunculosis). If furunculosis occurs, severe inflammation of
the chin may develop. Canine acne is typically characterized by the presence of
papules, nodules that may erode or ulcerate, and draining tracts (furunculosis)
bcalized to the chin and lips. It typically affects young dogs of short-coated
breeds. Feline and canine acne are often complicated by secondary superficial
and/or deep pyoderma

Canine zinc-responsive dermatosis is an inflammatory skin disorder that may be
associated with a true or relative dietary zinc deficiency (type 2) or altered
absorption of zinc from the gastrointestinal tract despite consumption of a nutri-
tionally balanced diet (type 1). Siberian huskies and Alaskan malamutes are
prone to develop type 1 disease, possibly because of an autosomal recessive

Pyodermas
SUPERFICIAL PYODERMA
Superficialpyodermaindogs is typicallycausedbyStaphylococcus
pseucintemmedius, which frequenty colonizes mucocutaneous areas such as the
nasal mucosa, anal ring. and perineum. In the large majority of cases, it is a
secondary problem complicating underlying diseases.Canine superficial
 pyoderma is often recurrent, because most associated underlying disorders, such
a5 atopic dermatitis, are non-curable. Clinical signs in the dog are variable and
include papules, pustules, epidermal colarettes, yellow-brown crusts, and/or
moth-eaten alopecia (especially in short-coated breeds). The trunk, ventral
abdomen, inguinal area, and/or inner thighs are commonly affected. Cats are
generally much less often affected by superficial pyodenma than dogs, and this
may partly reflect differences in the skin barrier between these species. Agents

417
most frequently associated with feline s5uperficial pyoderma include S.
pseucfintermedius, S aureus, and S. felis. Clinical signs include papules, pustules.
and/or yellow-brown crusts. Self-inflicted, eroded to ulcerated lesions of cats
often become over-colonized with coccus-shaped bacteria. Treatment includes
topical therapy in the fomm of medicated shampoos and/or creams/ointments and
systemic antibiotics. The treatment should be planned taking into consideration
the etiologic agent, depth and extent of the lesions, the patient's age. body
weight, and tolerance to dngs. and the owner's commitment to the designed
treatment. If using a systemic antibiotic, remember to choose the appropriate
antibiotic (ideally based on culture and susceptibility) and administer it at the
correct dosage for the appropriate duration of time (i.e., at least 1 week past
dinical resolution). Identifying the underlying disease will help prevent recurrences.

DEEP PYQDERMA
Deep pyoderma occurs when the bacteria reach the dermis and/or
subcutaneous tissue via rupture of the hair follicle or penetrating wounds.
Staphyiococcus pseuointermedius is the most common etiologic agent in
dogs. but S. aureus, S. schleiferi, and less commonly Gram-negative bacteria
such as Pseudomonas or Proteus may also be involved. In cats, fight abscess is
the most common form of deep bacterial infection, and bacteria from the oral
cavity are typically involved, including Pasteurela muitocida, Bacteroides,
Fusobacterium, armong others. Similarly to superficial pyoderma, the large
 majority of cases are secondary to an underlying disease. Clinical signs include
erythema, ill-defined swelling. hemorrhagic bulla, papules, nodules, draining
tracts, erosions, ulcerations, crusts, abscesses, and/or cellulitis. Lesions may
be confined to one body region such as the face or feet, or they may

Miscellaneous
ACRAL LICK DERMATITIS
Acral lick dermatitis is one of the most challenging canine skin disorders that
dermatologists have to manage. The inciting causes that stimulate dogs to
compulsively lick and chew at the affected area are multiple and often not easy
to identify. which contributes to the difficulty in successfully managing these
cases. Large-breed dogs, especially Doberman pinschers, great Danes, golden
retrievers, Labrador retrievers, German shepherd dogs, and boxers appear to be
predisposed. The characteristic lesion is a well-demarcated plaque which is finm
(fibrotic) and has an eroded or ulcerated suiface. Lesions are typically single but
can be multiple and usually develop on the dorsal aspect of the carpal/metacarpal
region, but they can also be present on the tarsal/metatarsal area. Secondary
superficial bacterial over-growth and deep bacterial infection are often present,
and these should be addressed as part of the treatment regimen

CANINE FAMILIAL DERMATQMYOSITIS
Canine dermatomyositis is an inflammatory skin disorder that affects the skin
and muscle. Its pathomechanism is not well understood, but the ischemic
features characteristic of this disorder suggest an irmmunologic darmage to
blood vessels. It appears to be hereditary in collies and Shetland sheepdogs.
and an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with variable expressivity has
been suggested for collies. Other breeds reported with this condition include
kuvasz, chow chow, German shepherd dog. and Welsh corgi. but additional
breeds can be infrequently affected. The age of onset is typically 6 months or
less, but adult dogs can also be affected. Clinical signs include scarring
alopecia, scaling. crusting. and erythema, and lesions are typically localized to

CANINE SYMMETRICAL ONYCHODYSTROPHY
Symmetrical  onychodystrophy  is also  known  as  symmetrical  onychitis,
etiopathogenesis is currently unknown and German shepherd dogs, Norwegian
Gordon setters, and English setters appear to be predisposed. Typically multiple
or all nails present with sloughing of the plate (onychomadesis), fragmentation
and horizontal detachment of the plate at the free edge (onychorrhexis), and
separation of the plate from the bed (onycholysis). Serous-sanguineous to
purulent exudate is often present, and the nails are typically very painful to the
touch. Secondary bacterial infection and paronychia (inflammation of the nail
fold) usually complicate this disorder. The first sign of response to therapy is pain/
discomfort resolution. A newly formed nail plate is often misshapen and dry.
Amputation of the third phalanx may be required in cases that do not respond
to medical treatment.

with antibiotic therapy completely resolving or significantly improving the condi-
tion. The eosinophilic plaque is characterized by an often eroded to ulcerated
well-demarcated plaque, typically localized to the ventral abdomen and inner
aspects of the thighs. The eosinophilic ulcer has an elevated border and often
spans the upper lip, with variable severity. The eosinophilic granuloma has differ-
ent clinical presentations but typically manifests as linear plaques that more
often develop on the caudal aspects of the thighs but can also occur at other
sites. Nodules or plaques (feet, tongue, ears, lip margin) or ill-defined swelling
(chin and lower lip) are other clinical presentations of the eosinophilic granu-
absent to severe. Lesions can spontaneously resolve, recur, or become refractory
to treatment. Identifying and controlling any underlying disease is an important
part of the treatment regimen
