Dedication
This book is dedicated to all who have helped me to become someone who could write/edit a book
worth reading.
There are numerous veterinarians who have influenced my life and my career. From my first dental
mentor, Dr. Michael Floyd, I learned not only dentistry, but also how to practice while still enjoying
a balance of fun in life. Special thanks to my true mentor and founding member of the AVDC,
Dr. Thomas Mulligan. Fortunately, you saw promise in me and worked diligently to bring it out,
even if I was reluctant initially. Thank you for taking me under your wing and teaching me to be my
best, through all those late nights at Main Street. However, veterinary medicine is more than
 dentistry. I would like to thank Dr. Barry Neichin, my first employer and the best general practitioner
I know, for teaching me the basics of veterinary medicine. Drs. Michael Kelly and Robert Tugend
continued that training and taught me that working in a team is rewarding. Finally, I would like to
thank Dr. Robert Rooks, from whom I gained skills in marketing and client communications.
 In addition to the veterinarians who have helped me along the way, I have benefited from working
with a great group of technicians and assistants. First and foremost in this group is Dawn Sabatino,
my night hand (and occasionally my left) for the last decade. So much of my practice would not be
 possible without you; thanks for all that you do. I owe many thanks to Robert Furman (soon to be
a veterinarian) who was instrumental in starting my dental practice as well as making my life easier
with his computer and electrical and handy man skills. A note of thanks is also due for my assistants
who went above and beyond in years past: Teresa, Wendy, Tia, and Diane.
Outside of veterinary medicine, I would like to thank and recognize my original inspiration and
uncle, Dr. Greg Steiner DDS, who told me back in the l980s to do veterinary dentistry! A special
note of gratitude to my old adventure buddy, Lynel Berryhill, whose support and technical help
during my applications to the Dental College and Academy were invaluable. I couldn't have done
This has greatly inmproved your (the readers') experience.
And finally, this book is largely dedicated to my parents Jim and Toni. Without your emotional

you for going above and beyond as parents, friends, and business mentors. You're the best!
Thanks to all of you for the contributions you have made to my life, which in turn have led to
the creation of this book.

FOREWORD
6
Veterinary dentistry has exploded as a discipline within veterinary medicine over the past 20+ years,
primarily due to the tireless efforts of those clinicians in the 1970s and early 1980s who took an often
overlooked area of the patient, and turned it into a focus of major significance. Thanks to these
pioneers in veterinary dentistry, many of us found our calling within veterinary medicine and provide
a valuable service to animals throughout the world. In the early days of veterinary dentistry, those
who had a special interest in dentistry would gather together and discuss conditions and treatments
they had found to be particularly helpful or successfiul. Out of these meetings rose the organization
of the American Veterinary Dental Society and the Veterinary Dental Forum. The Veterinary Dental
Forum has grown to an annual meeting of nearly loo0 participants, a far cry from the early days of
 getting together around a cold beverage to talk about your most challenging/rewarding cases! Also
blossoming out of the efforts of these pioneers has come the Journal of Veterinary Dentistry, a
quarterly publication that is currently recognized intermationally as the joumal of record for veterinary
dentistry. All these efforts were to help educate veterinarians about veterinary dentistry and to elevate
the practice of veterinary medicine in general.
Though many aspects of veterinary dentistry are continuously evolving, one constant is the clinical
practicality of veterinary dentistry. This is reflected in the organization and thought process
throughout this book. Dr. Niemiec does an excellent job presenting many dental conditions from a
very practical standpoint. Beginning with the initial oral examination, through the diagnostic
procedures, such as dental radiography, Dr. Niemiec provides pragmatic tips along the way Reading
this text is similar to the way practitioners think through diagnostic challenges within their own
practices. From the early chapters that focus on the normal oral/dental anatomy through the oral
examination and diagnostics for all areas of the mouth, this text is a valuable reference for both the
general practitioner and the seasoned veterinary dentist.
Those of us, like Dr. Niemiec, who have walked in the footsteps of those pioneers of the early
days of veterinary dentistry, can only hope to carry on the tradition of educating others in our quest
to relieve unnecessary patient suffering. This book is an excellent tribute to those practitioners.
With gratitude and thanks,

PREFACE
7
This book is designed to be a quick reference for practitioners to identify the common oral
pathologies in the dog and cat. All pathologies are demonstrated by typical photographic and, in
some cases, radiographic examples. Along with the graphic examples is a concise but complete and
differential diagnoses, diagnostic tests, and treatment/management. Each topic is then summarized
in easy-to-read key points. This format will make identification and initial therapy of oral diseases
much more efficient.
 The first three chapters set a foundation for assessing and diagnosing oral pathology. Chapter one
is a review of oral anatomy and physiology. In the style of the book, this is supported with numerous
full color images. Chapter two presents a stepwise guide on how to perform a proper oral
examination. These techniques will allow practitioners to find the subtle pathologies listed within
 techniques for obtaining quality dental radiographs, and the latter part discusses proper diagnosis of
dental radiographs with high-quality digital images.
Following this introduction, the book is presented by anatomic areas, to ease identification of
unknown pathology. These areas include problems with the: teeth; gingiva; oral mucosa; bones,
muscles, and joints; and salivary glands. Individual chapters have been created for pediatric
oral/dental problems and malignant oral neoplasia. These unique topics are presented separately
a s n siide a an s ss a asp an sde i a 
format, if a patient under about 9 months is presented, the practitioner should only have to go
beyond the pediatric chapter on rare occasions. Furthermore, if presented with a novel pathology,
the practitioner may not know the name of the disease process, thereby making an index much less

lesion is on the tooth), the practitioner can quickly scan just a few pathologies until he/she finds a
picture that looks like the lesion in question. Then, in just a few minutes, the reader can learn all
about the disease process, including what tests should be run to confirm the diagnosis as well as how
best to manage it. Even expenienced practitioners will benefit from the cutting edge information in
this book.
 In addition, the succinct and practical style of this volume lends itself to be a client-friendly
education tool. The veterinarian can use this peer-reviewed book to back up their management
recommendations. This is critically important in veterinary dentistry, as most pathologies do not
have obvious clinical signs that owners recognize (fractured teeth for example). The prudent
 practitioner will encourage clients to read the brief description of their pet's particular pathology,
thus improving client compliance with treatment recommendations. Since dental disease is present
in almost all veterinary patients, I would consider having a copy in each exam room. This will aid all
dental related discussions.
This book makes numerous treatment recommendations, but it is not a technical manual. For
those practitioners interested in improving their technical skills, I recommend Veterinary Dental
Techmiques, 3rd edn, by Holmstrom SE, Frost P, and Eisner ER (eds), Saunders, 2004. However,
these techniques (including dental radiology) are best learned through hands-on training at wetlabs.

INITIAL PERIODONTAL EVALUATION
During conscious oral examination, a preliminary
 generalized assessment of the periodontal health
should be performed. This is only a generalized
assessment at this time, encompassing the entire
mouth. Dental scoring systems range from 0 to
3, with 0 being normal. Gingivitis scoring is
known as gingival index (GI) and is defined as:
 GIl = Mild inflammation and color change, no
bleeding on probing.
50
GI2 = Moderate inflammation and bleeding
upon probing.
GI3 = Severe inflammation and spontaneous
gingival hemorrhage.

There are two major techniques for positioning
the beam head in dental radiology, both of which
are used daily in veterinary practice.
Parallel technigue²: By the strict definition,
this technique is used only on the mandibular
 premolar and molar teeth. All other teeth have
anatomical structures (palate or mandibular
symphysis) that preclude parallel film placement.

most accurate image (64).
Bisecting angie technigue²: This is by far the
most common positioning technique used in
veterinary patients (as the parallel technique
cannot be physically achieved for the majority of
teeth). The bisecting angle technique uses the

root length accurately (93). Variation on the
angle depends on the anatomy of the particular
patient. Note that the zygomatic arch (arrow) is
now visualized apical to the tooth roots, giving

a clear picture of the entire root system (94).
Splitting of the tooth roots (SLOB rule) is very
diffcult to achieve in this view. If this is critical,
use the acute angle technique described below.
An important point to remember when
utilizing the extraoral technique is that the film
needs to be marked in some way to distinguish
right vs. left. This is due to the fact that the
embossed dot is now facing into the mouth, as
 opposed to out of the mouth as in the intraoral
techniques. Therefore, when the films are
viewed they will be interpreted as the
contralateral arcade. In our practice, the

radiographs
Interpreting dental radiographs is similar to
interpreting a standard bony radiograph.
However, dental radiographic changes can be
much more subtle than those observed with
standard radiographs. In addition, there are
numerous pathologies which are unique to
dental radiology. Finally, there are many normal
anatomical structures that may mimic
 pathological changes.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The most common cause for a deciduous tooth
to be persistent is an incorrect eruption path of
the permanent toothl.2. When the permanent 
tooth erupts along its natural path, it places
 pressure on the apex of the deciduous tooth
resulting in root end resorption in the deciduous
tooth3.4. The steady coronal advancement of the
permanent tooth will result in continued
resorption. This progresses until the deciduous
root is sufficiently resorbed, at which point it
exfoliates, and the permanent tooth assumes its

mesial displacement of permanent tooth.
When the permanent follows an unnatural
path, there will be no impetus for the root of the
deciduous tooth to be resorbed. This will result
in the deciduous tooth persisting and the
12
 permanent tooth erupting alongside. This is
 contrary to the classic but mistaken belief that a
persistent (retained) deciduous tooth causes the
permanent tooth to erupt in an unnatural
position. This malpositioning of the permanent
teeth may or may not be genetically dictated.
However, due to the pattern of occurrence
within breeds and head types, it is currently
viewed as of genetic origin2.

MANAGEMENT
 If occlusal trauma is present, extraction of the
offending deciduous teeth should be performed
as quickly as possible to minimize the trauma and
relieve the patient's discomfort5. Even if there is
no current occlusal trauma, selective extraction
of the deciduous teeth should be performed to
remove the adverse dental interlock and allow
jaw movement. This is termed interceptive

However, recent texts recommend extracting any

hindrance to movement, while not extracting
teeth that may be creating a favorable dental

Mesioversion of the maxillary canines is a

formation may result in tooth deviation4.
This mesioversion was previously believed to

Orthodontic therapy typically involves the use
of orthodontic buttons and elastics24. The
 buttons are attached to the maxillary canine, and
the distal attachment is generally a combination
of the maxillary fourth premolar and first molar.
Healthy root structure of these two teeth is
required to provide suffcient anchorage4 to
allow movement of the large maxillary canine
without displacing the anchor tooth/teeth.
Other maxillary teeth as well as the mandibular
molar can also be used in various combinations
for anchorage. Orthodontic movement is a long-
term therapy which can be very diffcult,
especially if the patient is orally inclined as this
may result in lost buttons. Another possible

DEFINITION
This congenital condition is caused by a failure
 of the primary palate to fuse, resulting in a fissure
in the rostral lip2,4,10.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
While this lesion is congenital,it is not necessarily
 genetic. It has been reported in the veterinary
literature to be secondary to intrauterine stress or
trauma, rather than a genetic cause2. However,

hardness provides wear resistance to the tooth
surface. The impervious nature of enamel
 protects the pulp from bacterial ingress and from
dentin sensitivity that occurs when dentin is
exposed to the oral cavity. The smooth surface of
enamel provides some degree of resistance to
bacterial adherence and plaque formation. In
contrast to enamel, the underlying dentin is
softer, is traversed by dentinal tubules leading

directly to the dental pulp, and has a rougher
surface. Exposed dentin wears faster, and
 exposed dentin tubules experience hydrostatic
pressure changes on the cell processes that
extend into them which create discomfort.
Exposed dentin also accumulates plaque and
calculus faster than intact enamel. When
uncomplicated crown fractures occur to a tooth

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
Diagnosis is made on the clinical appearance of
the fractured tooth. Abrasion lesions typically
have a more regular appearance and a smoother
surface. Careful evaluation of the occlusal
relationships (with the mouth held closed and
the teeth in full occlusion) rules out attrition
from occlusal trauma against the opposing
dentition. A sharp dental explorer passed over the
area of the pulp horn moves unimpeded across

If the explorer drops into a hole in the center of
the tooth, or ifit stimulates any bleeding, then it
is a complicated fracture.
MANAGEMENT
Very small chips in teeth of mature animals may
not require intervention, other than a discussion
with the owner about appropriate toys, treats,
and activities to prevent further trauma. If the

significant trauma. Maxillary canine teeth in
cats are particularly prone to fracture due to
their extension beyond the lips. When a cat's

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
182
Commonly called ^tooth decay', caries most
often affects the occlusal surfaces of the molar
teeth, or the contact surfaces (the sides of the
teeth that face towards the adjacent teeth). Root
surfaces can also develop caries. Dental caries has
been extensively studied in humans, but poorly
studied in dogs. In humans, caries begins with
the acidic destruction of teeth by acids that are
produced when plaque bacteria ferment dietary
carbohydrates6. There is also a clear genetic
susceptibility factor. Therefore, caries is caused
by a combination of genetic susceptibility,
the presence of cariogenic bacteria (usually
Streptococcus mutans,but also other Streptococcus
spp. and Lactobacillus spp.), and an available

undermined enamel collapses, forming an open

particles7. The occlusal surfaces of molar teeth
have the highest caries risk in both humans and
dogs8. There are a few factors that may
contribute to the resistance of dogs to
developing dental caries. Their occlusal surfaces
have fewer pits and fissures than human premolar
and molar teeth. Also, S. mutans is not a

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
Diagnosis is made through clinical observation.

MANAGEMENT
 Intervention is generally not necessary unless the

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Internal resorption is caused by inflammation of

a vital pulp. Although mild pulpitis can stimulate
an increased production of dentin, pulpitis can
also cause localized spots of dentin resorption.
The resorption occurs from the inside wall of
the root canal or pulp chamber when the
odontoblast layer has been disrupted and the
pulp develops a granuloma24. Pulp is often
necrotic coronal to the region of internal
resorption. The resorption process can only

routine radiographs. A focal area of expansion in

221
Teeth with severe pulp hemorrhage are in

should be treated with root canal treatment or
extraction26. This is generally the case for
individual teeth that are discolored due to
traumatic pulp hemorrhage. For teeth that have
become intrinsically stained by deposition of
tetracycline or similar materials, intervention is
 not required. External bleaching and whitening
techniques are ineffective. Internal (nonvital)
bleaching can help esthetically, but this is not

DEFINITION
These are dental tooth resorptions (TRs) with
no known etiology or identifiable cause.
Although feline dental TRs are technically
included in this category, the feline lesions are

professionals now believe that some of these
232
lesions in people are caused by abfraction.
Abfraction occurs when lateral forces act on
the teeth, for example those caused by
malocclusion of parafunctional habits. Lateral
forces cause microflexure of the crown.
Stresses are concentrated at the cervical area
where the unsupported crown joins the roots
which are firmly supported by the alveolar
bone, resulting in damage to the cementum
and to the tooth. Whether abfraction is a
factor for animals has not been proven, but
seems likely. Idiopathic resorption in dogs

Gingivitis
234
DEFINITION
Gingivitis refers to any inflammation of the
 gingiva; however, the term is usually used to refer
 to plaque bacterial-induced gingivitis.

inflammatory response are all factors in the

subgingivally. Supragingival plaque is primarily a
gram-positive aerobic bacterial population,
whereas subgingival plaque bacteria are a more
prominent population of gram-negative and
anaerobic bacterial. If subgingival plaque persists,
it can lead to chronic gingivitis and the potential
development of periodontitis.
 Factors that enhance plaque accumulation will
favor the development of gingivitis. Crowding of

drugs that alter the host inflammatory response
may also, predispose to the development of
gingivitis2.
The level of the epithelial attachment of the
gingiva to the tooth surface is not altered in
 gingivitis. This means that there is no attachment
loss, no periodontal pocket formation, and
gingivitis is completely reversible with removal of
subgingival plaque3.

with weekly application of the homecare
product, there was a decrease in both plaque
and calculus accumulation as well as gingival
bleeding over an 8 week period9.
 Home care is extremely important to prevent
the rapid return of plaque and gingivitis. Plaque
begins to accumulate within hours of a dental
cleaning and if appropriate plaque control
measures are not taken, the patient will again
develop gingivitis. Daily tooth brushing is the
gold standard for plaque prevention. It is usually
only necessary to brush the buccal and labial
tooth surfaces. This is much easier for owners to
do than trying to open a dog or cat's mouth to
brush the palatal and lingual aspects of the teeth.
Other methods for plaque removal include
manual removal using a gauze sponge or other
device, feeding a dental diet or dental treats with
proven dental benefits, and dental chew toys.
Chlorhexidine is an excellent antimicrobial for
decreasing plaque, and may be added to the
home care regimen for certain patients. When
advising owners on appropriate dental treats and
toys, it is important to give precautions
regarding potential adverse effects such as
intestinal blockage if large pieces are swallowed,
and fractured teeth if hard objects are given.

periodontal pocket is measured from the
cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the epithelial
attachment on the tooth. This must be done
gently, so as not to penetrate the epithelial
attachment. When the gingiva has receded, the
attachment loss is determined by the sum of the
gingival recession (measured from the free
gingival margin to the CEJ) and the associated
periodontal pocket (267, 268) (overpage). A

The inflammation associated with periodontal
disease will result in osteoclastic bone resorption.
In the majority of cases, if left untreated (or
under treated) the resorption will continue until
the tooth exfoliates. However, some areas of the
tooth (or roots of multirooted teeth) may
become severely involved while other areas (or
roots) retain the tooth in alveolar bone
The fistula is created by periodontal disease
 progressing apically on the maxillary teeth. The
most common tooth involved is the maxillary
canine8-10. The roots of these teeth are adjacent
and parallel to the nasal cavity, and are separated
from it by only a thin sheet of bonel. Periodontal
disease commonly destroys the thin plate of bone
along with the normal attachment of the tooth.
This results in a communication between the oral
and nasal cavities. The bacteria in the mouth,
along with food particles and other debris, will
enter the nose through this fistula and create an
infection in the nasal cavity (sinusitis). The
infection will continue until the defect is
surgically corrected.

For this reason, it is
recommended to add steroid sparing agents such

cases52,55. Bullous pemphigoid is the most
 difficult autoimmune type to treat, and usually

DEFINITION
This is defined as oral damage caused by an

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

also occur due to chewing on an object (i.e.

be exposed during self-groomingl. There are

This typically requires general anesthesia in

Superficial areas of necrosis usually heal within
2 weeks. If lesions are severe, conservative
surgical debridement should be performed to
promote healing and prevent spread of the
necrosis52. Dilutional therapy of the remainder
of the alimentary tract should be performed if
there is any evidence or possibility of ingestion.

luxated from the alveolus.
+Skull radiographs.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Tooth avulsion and luxation injuries are usually
a result of trauma and the maxillary canine and
 incisor teeth are most often affected22.26,27.
 Many times the tooth becomes caught on a rigid
object and is avulsed or luxated as the animal
attempts to pull away. Other causes of tooth
avulsion and luxation are falls, dog fights, or
automobile trauma26,28
CLINICAL FEATURES
358
Animals may present with a true avulsion
injury, where the tooth is completely separated
from the alveolus (357). With luxation injuries
the tooth may still be partially attached to
alveolar bone but deviated from its normal
position (358, 359). The tooth may be
luxated in coronal direction, which is termed
extrusive luxation. The tooth may also be
displaced into the alveolus, which is termed
intrusive luxation28. There may be a history of
trauma or an unsupervised period. There are
often traumatic injuries to the periodontal
tissues, including alveolar fractures, gingival

Complete en bloc surgical excision with
1.5-2 cm margins of ^normal’ tissue is the
treatment of choice for the majority ofthe oral
tumors, especially those located in the rostral
oral cavity 16,17.
 Radiation therapy should be considered in
cases where complete excision is not feasible,
or if the tumor is located in the caudal oral
cavity. Orthovoltage machines capable of
 delivering low energy external beam radiation
are not optimal for treating oral malignancies
in most cases. Megavoltage radiation therapy is
currently the standard of care for dogs with
oral tumors. Acute effects of oral radiation such
as oral mucositis, alopecia, local moist
dermatitis, and desquamation occur in almost
every case. However, these effects are not dose
limiting. These effects are reversible, medically
manageable, and resolve over 2-3 weeks after
compietion of radiation therapy. The late
effects of radiation such as bone or muscle
necrosis are less likely to occur. These late
effects, if they occur, are irreversible and are
dose limiting factors. In one retrospective

 is more of a problem in younger dogs18.

Cytologically, the diagnosis of OMM may be
challenging due to the variation in the degree
of pigmentation: some tumors may even be
completely unpigmented. Another complicating
factor is that the microscopic features can

Sialoceles
665
DEFINITION
Sialoceles are retention cysts (pseudocysts) of
salivary fluidsl. They are not true cysts as they
lack an epithelial lining2. Ranulas are sialoceles
which are typically found under the tongue? or
on the floor of the mouthl. Sialoceles are the
most common problem associated with the
 salivary gland in dogs and cats4.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
These lesions occur secondary to a rupture of a
399 Small zygomatic mucocele in a dog (arrow).
salivary duct resulting in the spillage of mucin
into the surrounding soft tissuel. The most
common cause of the rupture is traumal.5.6.
400
Trauma can be blunt (e.g. hit by a car), sharp
(e.g. gunshot), or foreign body (e.g. foxtail) in
 onigin. In addition, it is not uncommon for these
to occur after oral surgery (extraction, oral
fracture repair, or neoplastic excision) due to
transection of a salivary duct7. There are
numerous cases however, in humans and animals
with no history of traumal,6.Sialoceles can also
result from blockage of the duct by mucin,
sialoliths, or inflammation?. Finally, there is one

of dentin that extends to the pulp cavity); most of
the tooth has lost its integrity
(TR4a) Crowm and root are equally affected
(TR4b) Crown is more severely affected than
the root
(TR4c) Root is more severely affected than
the crown
