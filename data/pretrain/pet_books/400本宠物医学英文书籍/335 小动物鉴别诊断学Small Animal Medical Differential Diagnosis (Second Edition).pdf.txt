PREFACE
Whiern I was asked by Elsevier to create a secorid editior1 of Smoff
Animaf Differenfiaf Diagrtosis: A Book of Lists, I erivisioried ari easy
process of updatirg thie lists of the first editiorn and addirig some
rew material. I couldri't hiave beern more wrorig. Thie goal was
to duplicate the fommat of the first editiori: a quick, coricise, arid
practical reference to differeritial diagriosis, etiology, laboratory
values, arid classificatiorn of clirical sigris anid medical disorders
in dogs anid cats. As I reviewed each list I was surprised to see
how mariy rieeded to be revised. In fact, rearly all of the lists
required additioris, subtractioris, or sometimes complete reor-
ganization. A project like this ore is a great illustratiori of how
much the veterinary medical literature expards ir1 a 6-year pe-
riod. Orice again, this text will be a pocket-sized, rapid refererice
or ar1 electroric applicatiorn. Its greatest value will be to aid the
clirician in making reliable ori-thie-scere decisioris arid to al-
low veteririary students and intemis to more fully participate ir1
clirical rourids with their iristructors. It will also be used by the
more seasoried practitiorier to come up with thiose more esoteric
 i        i s
potential diagrioses.
Thie lists iri this book have beer1 compiled from comprehier-
 si ve veterirary references published by Elsevier, especially:
Ettinger ard Feldmar: Texfbook of Veterinary Internaf Medicine,
severith editiori ard
· Nelsor1 arid Couto: Smaff Animaf Internaf Medicine, fourth

PREFACE
About the Book
As with the first editior, the lists are divided into three parts and
serve as a concise guide to the differenitial diagnosis, etiology,
laboratory abnormalities, and classificatior1 of clirical signs and
medical disorders ini dogs arid cats. Part Ore coritairs lists based
on clinical sigrns that may be idertified by thie cliniciar. Part
Two approaches differertial diagrosis from a systems perspec-
tive. Fifteen body systems are represerited. Part Three orice again
 l s p sisn o jo aaa si e s
raniges arid differeritial diagroses based on test results. Overall
thie book comprises 400 lists, 60 of whichi are riew to this editior1.
Ini all lists ar1 attempt hias beeri made to prioritize thiem from least
commor1 to most common1.

PART ONE
Clinical Signs Approach to Differential Diagnosis
Acquired Hyperpigmentation
Postinflammatory—Mediators of inflammation (e.g., leukotrienes,
thromboxaries) stimulate melariocytes to ircrease melarin
productior1, whiichi dowri regulates inflammation by scaverging
free radicles. Examples of inflammatory corditioris thiat lead
to increased melarin productior include allergies, Malassezia
dematitis, bacterial pyoderma, dermmatophytosis, demodecosis,
scabies, and actinic ard iritertrigo dematitis. Inflammation
affecting hair follicles may lead to melarotrichia (e.g., sebaceous
adernitis, paririculitis, vaccine reactioris),
Endocrine—hyperadrerocorticism, hypoadrerocorticism,
imbalances may result in diffuse hyperpigmentation.
of papillomavinus-associated, slightly raised, scaly, hyperpig-
merited macules ard plaques in their groin regiorn, abdomer,
veritral thiorax, arid reck. Similar lesioris are described ir1
miniature Schiriauzers, American Staffordshire terriers, arid
Pomerariaris. May trarisfom to squamous cell carcirioma.
Pigmerited tumorsapocrine cysts are bluishi, cutareous
hemarigiomas ard hemangiosarcomas appear red, dark purple,
or bluishi-black. Melariomas, melariocytomas, arid basal cell
tumors are frequeritly black. Squamous cell carciriomas,

Hereditary Hypopigmentation
Albirism—hereditary abserice of pigmerit
Piebaldism—preserice of whiite spots whiere melariocytes are abserit
Waarderburg-Kleir1 syrdrome—affected arimals have abserice of
melariocytes ir1 areas of skini arid hair, blue or hieterochiromatic
eyes, ard are also deaf. Reported in cats, bull terriers, Sealyham
terriers, collies, Dalmatiar1s
Carine cyclic hematopoiesis—lethal autosomal recessive
disease of collies. Gray coat, light-colored rose, cyclic
episodes of reutropenia every 12-14 days resulting in sepsis
and amyloidosis
Chédiak-Higashi symdrome—rare autosomal recessive disease of
blue smoke Persian cats. Partial oculocutaneous albinism with
abriormal function of grarulocytes and platelets resulting in1
hemorrhage, recurrerit infectiors, and death at a yourg age.
Graying—age-associated, reduction of melariocyte replicatior.
Vitiligo—macular leukoderma and leukotrichia of nose, ears,
buccal mucosa, ard facial skin. Antimelariocyte antibodies
fourid in serum of some affected dogs. Seeri most commorly
in Siamese cat, Belgian Tervuren, German Shepherd, collie,
Rottweiler, Dobermar Pirscher, Giarit Schirauzer.
Nasal hypopigmeritation—seasor-associated lightering of rasal
plarium during wiriter morithis most commor in Siberiar
Husky, Golder Retriever, Labrador Retriever, arid Bermiese

Postinflammatory—Discoid lupus erythiematosus is the most
common cause of postinflammatory rasal depigmentation.
Also pemphigus complex, SLE, uveodermatologic symdrome,
bullous pemphigoid, mucocutaneous pyodema, drug eruption,
ard coritact dermatitis. Irfectious causes include leishimariasis,
Drug related—ketocorazole, procairiamide, and vitamin E may

Guidelines for Retroviral Testing in Cats
Sick cats should be tested evern if thiey have tested negative
before.
Cats arid kitteris shiould be tested whier1 thiey are first
acquired.
Evern cats riot expected to live withi othier cats shiould be
tested. This provides a health assessmerit of thie individual,
othier cats may join the household, indoor cats may escape
arid expose othier cats.
Tests should be performed at adoptior1 and negative cats
should be retested a minimum of 60 days later.
SECTION vll Infectious Disease
187
+ Cats withi kriowr1 recerit exposure to a retrovirus-irifected
cat or a cat with unknowr1 status, particularly via a bite
wourid, shiould be tested regardless of previous test results.
Testing should be dorie immediately ard, if regative, should
 be repeated after a minimum of 30 days for FeLV and after
          
viral exposure is urikriowri, retesting for both viruses after
60 days is most practical).
· Cats living in househiolds with othier cats infected with FIV
or FeLV should be tested arirually.
· Highi-risk cats (cats in cat-derise rieighborhioods or cats thiat
fighit ard get cat-bite wourds ard abscesses) should be tested
regularly.
 Cats shiould be tested before iritial vacciriatiori agairst FeLV
Or FIV.
 Cats used for blood or tissue donation should have negative
screering tests for FeLV ard FIV arid should be regative for
real-time PCR tests.
Intermittent retesting is not necessary for cats with
conifimed riegative inifectior1 status uriless thiere is
opporturity for exposure to inifected cats or if thiey
become ill.
·Each cat should be individually tested. Testing of one cat as a
 s adn  sands luod no lae ro xo
testing is irappropriate.
Cinical Signs of Rabies Virus Infection in Cats
Initially sigris are rionispecific: lethiargy, inappeterice,
vomiting, diarrhiea
 Rapid arid cortirual deterioratior1 of clinical conditioris, rio
waxing arid wanirg
 Behiavioral changes: more reclusive or attentiori-seeking,
may urpredictably attack arimate, inanimate, or urseen
objects
 Irrevocable progressior to classic sigrs, ptyalism with
decreased ability to swallow leads to contaminatior1 of
oral cavity, chin, arid forelegs with poteritially infectious
saliva. Cranial nerve sigrs such as anisocoria, pupil
dysfurctior, facial or tongue paresis, arid chianges in
phioriatior may occr.
Auditory, visual, or tactile stimulation may elicit profound
aggression to self-mutilation.

renal failure (sepsis arid immure-complex)
+Potassium—decreased in 20% of cases in1 dogs anid S6% in
cats. Increased loss in1 vomiting arid due to renal loss with
fluid therapy plus reduced intake ard aldosterore release
caused by hypovolemia

Sodium—can be increased, decreased or nomal. Increase
usually caused by dehiydratior, decrease caused by losses
secondary to vomiting
Calcium—Commonly decreased in cats, rarely in dogs,
rarely increased in both dogs and cats. Reduction is
a poor prognostic indicator in cats but no prognostic
sigrificanice in dogs. May be caused by saporification
in1 peripancreatic fat arid glucagor release stimulating
calcitorin
ChlorideVery commonly decreased in dogs. Loss in
gastrointestinal secretioris in vomiting
· Phosphate—Ofteri increased in dogs, uncommonly inicreased
or decreased in cats. Increase usually due to reduced rerial
excretion secoridary to reral compromise. Decrease (iri cats)
due to treatmerit for diabetes mellitus
Glucose-increased in 40-88% of dogs and decreased in
up to 40%. Increased in 64% of cats, rarely decreased.
Iricrease due to decreased irsulin and increased glucagor1
cortisol, arid catecholamines. Decrease caused by sepsis or
anorexia
Albumin—Increased in 39-50% and decreased in 17% of dogs.
hicreased in1 8-30% ard decreased in1 40% of cats. Inicrease
due to dehydratior1. Decrease due to gut loss, malrutrition1,

Minimize negative pressure (may cause vein to flutter agairist
needle, crushing red cells)
Repositior rieedle deeper, or slighitly rotate to move bevel of
rieedle away from vessel wall.
Resist tendency to increase vacuum by using more riegative
force; “milk" the vein.
Use vacuum tubes and reedles instead of syringes.
Remove reedle ard specimer tube stopper, ard trarisfer

Thyroid Function Tests
Total T, (thyroxine, tetraiodothyronine):
Measures free T4 and proteir-bourd T4.
 Below-rnormal values suggest hypothyroidism (dogs).
Above-normal values ini cats are likely caused by
hyperthyroidism.
Below-riomal values are also seer1 with1 uriderlyirg illriess (sick,
euthyroid).
Free T, (FT):
Below-nomal values suggest hypothyroidism (dogs).
Above-normal values in cats are likely caused by
hyperthyroidism.
Not as affected by thie suppressive effects of coricurrert illriess
as total T4.
Modified equilibrium dialysis assay is riot affected by circulating
antithyroid homore antibodies ard therefore is thie
preferred assay for fT4.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone(TSH)concentration:
Must be interpreted iri corjurictiori with serum T4 ard fT4.
Low value for serum T4 arid fT4 with a high TSH supports
diagrnosis of hypothyroidism.
Nommal T4 and fT4 and nomal TSH rule out hypothyroidism.
TSH and thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH)stimulation tests:
Used to differentiate hiypothyroidism from euthyroid sick
symdrome.
PARTTHREE
Laboratory Values and Interpretation of Results
321
These tests are not typically dore because of availability and
expense of reagerits.
T,(3,5,3'-triiodothyronine)concentration:
 Poor indicator of thyroid furiction in dogs and cats; rot
recommended.
Tests for fymphocytic thyroiditis:
Autoartibodies to circulating thyroid homone (T4 arid T3) ard
thiyroglobulin (Tg) correlate with lymphiocytic thyroiditis
Tg autoartibodies may be preserit wher T4 and T3 are rot;
therefore testing for Tg autoartibodies is corisidered the
better screening test.
Provides rio informatiorn about thie severity of disease or thie
extert of thiyroid glarid irivolvemerit
Hypothyroid dogs may be negative, and euthyroid dogs may
have Tg autoantibodies.
May be used as a prebreeding screeririg test ir breedirg dogs
T, suppression test:
Administratior1 of T3 to riormal cats should suppress pituitary
TSH secretiori, decreasing thie serum T4 coriceritration1.
Administratior1 of T3 to hyperthyroid cats should have no
suppressive effect.
Corifims hyperthyroidism ir1 cats withi occult disease
Toxoplasmosis Antibody Titer
Positive titer indicates exposure but not recessarily active
infection.
Positive IgM titer greater thiar 1:256 is corsisterit withi acti ve
infection, especially with typical clinical sigris.
Fourfold rise in IgG titer of paired samples 2 to 3 weeks apart
also supports active infectiori.

Carnine: 5.7-45.2.0 μg/L
PLI:
Feline: 0.1-3.5 μg/L
Carine: 0-200 μg/L
Low TLI values (<2.S μg/L for dogs and <8.0 μg/L for cats)
are diagnostic for exocrine paricreatic inisufficiency; values be-
s 10y T/81 0'71 pue 0'8 pue s8op 10y T/8 0's pue s'z uaam
are corisidered equivocal, ard the assay should be repeated in
1 morith.
High values for TLI are supportive of a diagriosis of acute or
chroric pancreatitis.
Elevated values for PLI (>12 μg/L for cats and > 400 μg/L for
dogs) are corsistert with a diagriosis of parcreatitis.
Patierits must be fasted at least 12 hiours.
Note: These tests are species specific,and samples mustbe labeled “dog
or"cat"so hat the test can be performed correcty

Hyafine casts:proteirn precipitates(Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein arid
albumin); seer with proteinuric renal disease (glomenulorephritis,
amyloidosis), small rumbers with fever arid exercise
Granufar casts: degeneration of cells ini casts or precipitation of
filtered plasma proteins; suggest ischemic or nephrotoxic renal
tubular injury
Cellutar casts: WBC casts (pyelonephritis), RBC casts (fragile,
rare in dogs and cats), renal epithielial cell casts (acute tubular
recrosis or pyeloriephiritis)
Waxy casts: final stage of degeneratior1 of grariular casts
