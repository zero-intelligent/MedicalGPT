Preface
The pace of change in microbiology has accelerated in
recent years as molecular techniques, applied to microbial
pathogens, elucidate the pathogenesis of many infectious
diseases and improve the reliability of diagnostic test
procedures.  Today, microbiology
occupiesacentral
position in the veterinary curriculum and has developed
into a subject of vast complexity. Since the publication of
VeterinaryMicrobiology andMicrobial Disease in2002.
many changes have occurred in veterinary microbiology,
some on the recommendations of international committees
The second edition of our book incorporates changes in
individual  chapters   which  have
ebeenupdatedand
expanded. In addition, new chapters on immunodeficiency
diseases, vaccines and vaccination, molecular diagnostic
methods, antibacterial resistance, antifungal chemotherapy,
antiviral  chemotherapy  and  microbial diseases of  the
urinary tract, cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal
system and the integumentary system have been added.
This edition is divided into seven sections. The first
section provides  an
1introductionto microbiology,
infection, immunity and molecular diagnostic methods.
Section II contains chapters on introductory bacteriology.
Pathogenic bacteria are dealt with in Section Iff. The
twelve chapters in Section IV are concermed with
mycology. Introductory virology is presented in Section V.
Viruses and prions are covered in Section VI. The final
section, Section VII, includes chapters on the interactions
47
of microbial pathogens with body systems. A separate
chapter in this section deals with bovine mastitis and the
final  chapter  provides  a  comprehensive review   of
disinfection, biosecurity and other aspects of disease
control
To facilitate readers requiring additional information on
topics included in the book, a list of websites is provided at
the end of Section VIl.
The use of colour in this edition enhances the quality of the
illustrations and facilitates the interpretation of complex
diagrams.
The authors would be pleased to receive notification of
errors or inaccuracies in this edition of our book.

Chapter 1
Microbiology, microbial pathogens and infectious disease
The earliest forms of life on this planet are presumed to
have had characteristics resembling those of bacteria, most
likely anaerobic bacteria. It is postulated that prokaryotes
evolved from primitive forms of life and that the
subsequent   availability   of   oxygen  resulting  from
photosynthesis contributed to microbial diversity. The
chronological sequence of evolutionary events relating to
the emergence of microbial life and, subsequently,
eukaryotic cells is outlined in Fig. 1.l. This proposed
scheme is based on limited factual information, some
deriving from information gleaned from fossilized remains
of prokaryotic cells approximately 3.5 billion years old and
also
from  studiesof ribosomal RNA
among
microorganisms.
Before the causes of infectious diseases could be discussed
and evaluated in a rational manner, events associated with
the emergence of life forms required explanation.
Traditional views on the origin of life were strongly
influenced by the writings of classical Greek and Roman
scholars, many of whom espoused the view of spontaneous
generation of small living entities. Disease was often
attributed to evil forces associated with disturbances in the
upper atmosphere, poisonous vapours called miasmas,
supermatural events and other influences unrelated  to
biology. Awareness of the possible existence of forms of
life not visible to the naked eye emerged slowly. As early
as 1546, in his treatise De Contagione, Girolamo
58
Fracastoro suggested that animate agents were responsible
for disease. Concepts of infectious diseases were closely
related to the demonstration of organisms too small to be
observed without magnification and to the isolation and
characterizationof
these
small
organisms,termed
microorganisms. Major developments in microbiology, the
study of these microorganisms, began with theories
relating to the causes of infectious diseases and continued
with the development of microscopy, which confirmed the
existence of microorganisms visible only by substantial
magnification. Towards the middle of the nineteenth
century, the pioneering work of Louis Pasteur and Robert
Koch confirmed the microbial aetiology of infectious
diseases. Progressive developments contributed to the
rapid expansion of knowledge and the establishment of
microbiology as a subject of major importance not only in
human and animal health but also in food processing and
preservation
Spontaneous generation as an explanation for  the
emergence of life from decaying organic matter was a
commonly held view for many centuries. It was postulated
that life began as a consequence of putrefaction or some
other associated change in organic matter. A number of
practical experiments aimed at testing this concept were
carried out, often with equivocal results. Improved
scientific methodology and  the availability  of suitable
instrumentation  gradually challenged  the acceptance of
spontaneousgeneration.
The  development  of the
microscope around 1600 offered a means of exploring
minute living entities, and the amateur Dutch scientist,
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, took a keen interest in the
examination of water, fluids and organic material. In fluids
59
he observed large numbers of motile structures, not visible
to the naked eye, which he called ^animalcules'. In 1675,
van Leeuwenhoek recorded the structures he observed,
which were probably bacteria, yeasts and protozoa.
However,
van
Leeuwenhoek's(
discovery
of
microorganisms did not resolve the issue of spontaneous
generation
The occurrence of maggots on putrefying meat was taken
as evidence of spontaneous generation. The Italian
physician and naturalist Francesco Reddi (1626-1697)
carried out relevant experiments on this topic and
flies laid their eggs on it. In the mid-eighteenth century,
the English naturalist John Needham investigated the
effect of boiling broth on the survival of microorganisms
He claimed to have detected microorganisms in boiled
broth    several
days
 later.  Needham's  experimental
procedureswere
shown subsequently to have been
unreliable. In1769, Lazzaro
Spallanzani
1  repeated
Needham's experiments and demonstrated that no
organisms survived in broth boiled for 1 hour. Needham
argued that air was essential for all life and that
Spallanzani had excluded air from the flasks containing
broth. As a defined branch of science, microbiology could
not advance until the concept of spontaneous generation
was disproved. When the French chemist Louis Pasteur
(1822-1895) became involved in investigations relating to
microbiology, his 
careful
1  planning    and 
intuitive
understanding of biology brought a new energy and
appropriate methodology which conclusively refuted the
prevailing theories of spontaneous generation. Pasteur's
interest in  spontaneous generation  was  prompted by
60
experiments which he had conducted on spoilage during
the fermentation of beet alcohol. He showed that a
contaminating yeast that produced lactic acid during
fermentation  and  which differed morphologically  from
brewers' yeast was responsible for the spoilage. He
deduced that both alcoholic and lactic fermentation
resulted from the metabolism and replication of the living
yeast cells. The solution to the spoilage problem during
       a  
raw materials to about 120° F (49°C) in order to kill
contaminating microorganisms prior to the addition of the
appropriate yeast cells. This process, now known as
pasteurization, is widely used to reduce microbial
contamination in order to prolong the shelf-life of milk and
some other foods.

An important technical advance, which stemmed from
Pasteur's fermentation studies, was the development of a
fluid medium suitable for culturing yeast cells. He then
developed

liquid
[  media 
  containing
specific
ingredients that  favoured the growth of particular
62
pathogenic bacteria. It was this development which
eventually allowed him to formulate the germ theory of
disease. The germ theory formed theFigure 1.1
Together with Pasteur, the German physician Robert Koch
Having observed bacilli in the blood of animals that had
died from anthrax, Koch demonstrated their pathogenicity
by injecting mice with the blood. The injected mice died
and the bacilli were present in preparations from their
swollen spleens. He was also able to transfer the infection
from mouse to mouse and to demonstrate the bacilli in
each newly infected mouse. Initially, Koch used blood
serum for growing the anthrax bacillus in vitro. Later, he
developed solid media which allowed isolation of
individual bacterial colonies. Using a solid medium, he
was eventually able to isolate the tubercle bacillus from the

formulated certain principles for proving that a specific
microorganism caused a particular disease (Box 1.1).
Pasteur's germ theory of disease and Koch's postulates are
the two cornerstones on which microbiology is based and
without which this branch of biology could not have
advanced.
By the end of the nineteenth century a number of
important infectious diseases had been confirmed as
bacterial in origin. Both Pasteur and Koch contributed to
the identification and confirmation of the causal agent of
anthrax. Pasteur demonstrated that fowl cholera, malignant
oedema and suppurative lesions were each associated with
63
a specific bacterial infection. The causative organisms of
tuberculosis and typhoid fever were recognized by Koch
and his associates. Other bacterial agents responsible for
serious infectious diseases including glanders, gas
gangrene, diphtheria and dysentery were isolated by
laboratory scientists in Europe, North America and Japan.
The basic technical approaches, pioneered by Pasteur and
Koch, failed to shed light on the causes of such serious
infectious diseases as rabies, smallpox, foot-and-mouth
disease and rinderpest. Despite the absence of specific
knowledge about the aetiology of these diseases,
successful vaccines were introduced both for smallpox, by
Edward Jenner in the late eighteenth century, and for
rabies, by Pasteur and his associates in the latter half of the
nineteenth  century. The  development  by  Pasteur's
co-worker, Charles Chamberland, of the porcelain filter to
produce bacteriologically-sterile water for use in culture
media, eventually facilitated isolation of the filterable
agents which caused viral diseases. Remarkably, the
technique was first used to elucidate the cause of a plant
viral disease, tobacco mosaic disease.
BOX 1.1 Koch's postulates
- The pathogenic microorganism must be present in
every case of the disease but absent from healthy
animals
· The suspected microorganism must be isolated
and grown in pure culture
 The same disease must occur when the isolated
microorganism is injected into healthy susceptible
animals
64
 The same microorganisms must be isolated again
from  the injected  animals which  developed
disease
Dmitri Ivanovsky, a Russian scientist, reported in 1892
that it was possible to transmit tobacco mosaic disease
from diseased to healthy plants using filtered leaf extract
as inoculum. The filters used by Ivanovsky
were
Chamberland porcelain filters designed to remove bacteria
from drinking water. In 1898, Martinus Beijerinck,
unaware of the work of Ivanovsky, also demonstrated the
filterability of the agent of tobacco mosaic disease.
Moreover, he realized that the disease could not be due to
a toxin as the filtered sap from infected plants could be
used for serial transmission of the disease without loss of
potency. In the same year, Loeffler and Frosch identified
the first filterable agent from animals, the virus of
foot-and-mouth disease. Yellow fever virus, a filterable
agent pathogenic for humans, was described by Walter
Reed and his team in 1901. Ellerman and Bang, in 1908,
demonstrated the oncogenic potential of a filterable agent,
the cause of avian leukosis. In 1915, Frederick Twort
observed that bacteria were susceptible to a filterable
agent, and two years later Felix d'Herelle made a similar
observation.
D'Herelle
 named
these
viruses
‘bacteriophages’ and
1  developed  a  technique
establishing  their concentration  in  active  preparations.
Bacteriophages have proved to be particularly useful in
studies on viral replication and bacterial genetics.
Initially, the only method available for recovering large
quantities of virus was through infecting susceptible
65
animals. In 1913 Steinhardt and his colleagues succeeded
in growing vaccinia virus in explants of guinea-pig cornea
embedded in clotted plasma. Some 20 years later, Furth
and Sturmia used mice as a host species for propagating
viruses, while Woodruff and Goodpasture were successful
in propagating fowlpox virus on the chorioallantoic
membrane of embryonated eggs. A major advance was
made in the early 1950s with the development of single
cell cultures. Factors critical in this development included
the  availability   of   antibiotics  to  control  bacterial
contamination, and the use of trypsin to obtain cell
suspensions from embryonic or adult tissue. The separated
cells could then be grown as monolayers on glass surfaces.
Continuous cell lines, capable of multiplying indefinitely,
provided a reliable source of cells for virus cultivation.

In 1887 Buist observed vaccinia virus using a light
microscope. However, because of the limited resolving
power of this type of microscopy, the structure of the virus
was not discernible. In 1939 Kausche and his co-workers
employed the newly-developed electron microscope and a
metal shadowing technique to identify tobacco mosaic
virus in purified preparations. Ultrastructural studies of
viruses were greatly expanded and enhanced in the 1950s
by the development of negative staining and methods for
cutting ultrathin sections. X-ray diffraction methods have
been applied to viruses since the 1930s, when it was
discovered that simple viruses could be crystallized. The
first complete high-resolution structure of a crystalline
virus, tomato bushy stunt virus, was obtained by Harrison
and his co-workers in 1978. Computer analysis of the
diffraction patterns  obtained by  such studies has
contributed to knowledge of the molecular structure of
viruses.
67
The crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) by
Stanley in 1935 provided a boost to the analysis of the
chemical composition of viruses. In 1937 Bawden and
Pirie showed that TMV contained nucleic acid as well as
proteins, and helped to promote the idea that viruses
consisted of nucleic acid contained within a protein coat.
Having elucidated the structure of DNA and observed the
limited coding capacity of viral nucleic acid, Watson and
        s
surrounded by a shell of identical protein subunits. In 1962
Lwoff and his colleagues proposed a universal system on
which the modern classification of viruses is based. The
method of classification proposed was based on the
following criteria: (1) the type of nucleic acid; (2) the
symmetry of the virus; (3) the presence or absence of an
envelope; (4) the diameter of the nucleocapsid (helical
viruses) or the number of capsomers (icosahedral viruses).
The discovery of the enzyme reverse transcriptase in 1970
by Temin and Baltimore helped to elucidate retrovirus
replication and provided an essential tool for producing
      
recombinant DNA revolution. The study of retroviruses
has made a substantial contribution to the advancement of
basic research in neoplasia and the role of oncogenes in the
emergence of malignant tumours.
During the past century, major developments have taken
place in microbiological concepts, techniques and
applications. Modern microbiology encompasses the study
of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microscopic and
submicroscopic organisms

evidence that all organisms developed from a group of
primitive cells rather than from a single organism
(Doolittle, 1999). Prokaryotes are considered as one
branch of the phylogenetic tree and eukaryotes as the
second branch (Fig. 2.1). Lateral as well as horizontal
transfer of genetic material probably occurred in the course
70
of evolutionary development, with some bacterial genes
incorporated into members of the Archaea and perhaps
with some prokaryotic genes incorporated into eukaryotes.
This lateral gene transfer may explain how complex
eukaryotic cells acquired some of their genes and
organelles. The endosymbiosis hypothesis proposes that at
some stage in their early development, eukaryotic cells
became  primitive  phagocytes  and  acquired  particular
bacterial  cell  types  which  enhanced  their  respiratory
activity (de Duve, 1996). It is proposed that the engulfed
bacteria provided extra energy through this enhanced
respiration to the host cell and eventually evolved into
mitochondria. A similar phenomenon may account for the
development of chloroplasts in plant
cells.The
cytoplasmic  membrane  is  the  site of respiratory  or
photosynthetic energy generation in prokaryotes, unlike
eukaryotes in which
1 these activities  occur in   the
membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts.
Microscopical techniques
A number of different microscopical methods are
employed for examining microorganisms. These include
bright-field, dark-field, 
phase-contrast and electron
microscopy. Table 2.2 summarizes common techniques
employed for the examination of microorganisms and the
particular types of microorganisms for which the
techniques are appropriate.  Units  of  measurement
employed in microscopy are indicated in Table 2.3.
The maximum magnification obtainable by bright-field
microscopy,  using  oil-immersion   objectives,  is
approximately 1,000x. With
 bright-field  microscopy,

(Table 2.4). They usually have rigid cell walls containing a

Fungi
Yeasts, moulds and mushrooms belong to a large group of
either unicellular or multicellular. Multicellular fungi
produce filamentous microscopic structures called moulds:
yeasts, which are unicellular, have a spherical or ovoid
shape and multiply by budding. In moulds, the cells are
cylindrical and attached end to end, forming branched
hyphae (Table 2.5). A notable feature of fungi is their
ability to secrete potent enzymes that can digest organic
76
matter. When moisture is present and other environmental
conditions are favourable, fungi can degrade a wide variety
of organic substrates. A small number of yeasts and
moulds are pathogenic for humans and animals. Some
fungi  invade  tissues 
whereas
 others  produce
 toxic
substances called mycotoxins which, if present on crops or
in stored food such as grain or nuts, can cause disease in
animals and humans.

pigments which impart distinct coloration to water surfaces
containing algal blooms. When water temperatures are
high, algal growth may be marked, leading to the
production of toxins that can accumulate in shellfish or in
water containing algal blooms.
Viruses
Unlike bacteria and fungi, viruses are not cells. A virus
particle or virion consists of nucleic acid, either DNA or
RNA, enclosed in a protein coat called a capsid. In
addition, some viruses are surrounded by envelopes.
Viruses are much smaller than bacteria, and typically range
in size from 20 nm to 300 nm in diameter (Table 2.6).
Despite their simple structure, viruses occur in many
shapes. Some are spherical, others are brick-shaped or
bullet-shaped and a few have an elongated appearance.
Because they lack the structures and enzymes necessary
for metabolism and independent reproduction, viruses can
multiply only within living cells. Both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells are susceptible to infection by viruses.
Those viruses that invade bacterial cells are called
bacteriophages. Pathogenic viruses which infect humans
destroying host cells. A small number of viruses are
aetiologically implicated in the development of malignant
tumours in humans and animals.

the basis of phenotypic expression including morphology
and  distinct  attributes reflecting  unique  metabolic
properties.   Increasingly,  classification  methods  for
microorganisms have come to rely heavily on genotypic
analysis. In recent years this has led to changes in the
classification and nomenclature of microorganisms
The practice  and  science  of  orderly  classification  of
taxon) is known as taxonomy. There are three interrelated
parts to taxonomy: identification, nomenclature and
classification. Taxonomy is important in microbiology
because (1) it permits accurate identification of organisms;
(2)it provides precise names that permit efficient
communication; (3) it groups similar organisms in a way
that allows predictions to be made and hypotheses to be
framed with reasonable confidence regarding members of
the same group. Most organisms are grouped according to
their    genotypic
and
phenotypic
characteristics.
Traditionally, great emphasis was placed on anatomical or
morphological similarities but this has increasingly been
replaced   by  a  polyphasic  approach  facilitated  by  the
availabilityof highly sophisticatedmethodsof
identification and the inclusion of additional criteria for the
description of new species. Examples of phenotypic
characteristics used in taxonomy include morphology,
metabolism, physiology, cell chemistry (particularly fatty
80
acid composition in the case of bacteria) and motility
DNA profiling, DNA-DNA hybridization, multilocus
cytosine in an organism's DNA (GC ratio) are examples of
the genetic methods used. Complementing these two types
of analyses is phylogenetic analysis, which attempts to
create a framework of evolutionary relationships. The
exponential   growth   in  the   availability  of   genetic
sequencing data has permitted taxonomy to increasingly
reflect phylogenetic relationships among microorganisms.
The basic taxonomic unit or group is the species. Similar
species are grouped into genera, which in turn are placed
in families. Several levels or ranks are used in this
classification, with higher ranks including individual
groups based on the shared properties of these groups. The
levels in ascending order are species, genus, family, order,
class, phylum and kingdom or domain (Fig. 2.2).
Traditionally, biologists have grouped organisms into five
kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists and bacteria.
However, analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene
sequences has suggested that cellular life has evolved
along three primary lineages. The three resulting groups
are called domains and are usually placed above the
kingdom level. Two of the domains, Bacteria and
Archaea, are exclusively microbial and prokaryotic, while
the third domain, Eukarya, contains the eukaryotes
In terms of sexually reproducing higher organisms, a
species is defined as a group or population composed of
similar individuals that are capable of interbreeding
naturally and are reproductively isolated from other
groups. However, the definition of what constitutes a
81
species  poses  particular  problems  in  microbiology.
Members of the Bacteria and Archaea do not undergo true
reproduction. As a result, bacteria tend to be defined
operationally or in subjective terms as a collection of
strains that share many similar properties but differ
significantly from other strains. It is possible to be more
precise by using a definition based on genetic data with a
species expected to share 70% or greater binding in
standardized DNA-DNA hybridization studies and/or over
97% gene-sequence identity for 16S ribosomal RNA
(rRNA). Recently a threshold range of 98.7 to 99%
sequence similarity has been recommended as the point at
which DNA-DNA reassociation experiments should be
required for testing the genomic uniqueness of a novel
isolate (Stackebrandt and Ebers, 2006 ). Further debate and
refinement regarding the definition of a bacterial species is
on-going
Microorganisms are generally named according to the
binomial system devised by the Swedish botanist Carolus
Linnaeus in the eighteenth century. The names are Latin or
Latinized Greek derivations and are printed in italics.
There are two parts, a capitalized generic name and a
specific epithet. For example, the bacterium that causes
anthrax in humans and animals is termed Bacillus
anthracis, Bacillus being the generic name and anthracis
the specific name. The naming of species and higher
groups of bacteria is regulated by the Bacteriological Code
-TheInternational Codeof NomenclatureofBacteria.
TheInternationalJournalofSystematicandEvolutionary
Microbiology  is the  official publication  for recording
taxonomical changes of Bacteria and Archaea. Websites

Viruses pose particular taxonomic problems in that they
are regarded as subcellular, non-living, infectious entities
and are often ignored or considered alongside their host
species by scientists dealing with the global taxonomy of
organisms. However, virologists are agreed that viruses
should be considered as a separate group of organisms
regardless of their host species, and have established a
free-standing virus taxonomy
derived
1  from  classical
Linnean systematics but with rules unique to the discipline
of virology. The system is operated by the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) with the
latest  information  on   viral
1 taxonomy published
periodically in report form (Fauquet et al., 2005 ) or
available  electronically
 at
http://ictvonline.org/
virusTaxonomy.asp. A number of points must be borne in
mind when considering the taxonomy of viruses: (1) it is
considered unlikely that viruses evolved from a single
original protovirus and, as a result, the highest level
recognized is that of order; (2) some viruses frequently
undergo genetic recombination and reassortment resulting
in chimeric organisms with polyphyletic genomes; (3)
some viruses infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.
evolving differently in the different host species; (4) some
viruses integrate into the genome of their host but can
switch between horizontal and vertical transmission by
moving in and out of the host cell genome, which may
result in the incorporation of host genes into the viral
genome. As a result, it is inevitable that the classification
system will at times appear artificial and give rise to
83
misfits. A non-systematic, polythetic, hierarchical system
of classification is used for viruses. In essence a virus
species is defined by a consensus group of properties
without any one of these properties being essential.
Viruses are generally grouped in families based on virion
morphology and nucleic acid type. Further subdivision of
pathogenic animal viruses frequently relates to the species
of host affected and to the clinical disease which is
produced. Each viral genus contains a type species, which
is defined as the virus species responsible for the original
creation of the genus and whose name is linked to the use
of the genus name. Virus species names are commonly
abbreviated, for example BPIV-3 for bovine parainfluenza
virus 3. In presenting taxonomic descriptions of viruses,
several informal categories, collectively known as the
s        
and structure of the viral genome, including genome
polarity and reverse transcription: double-stranded DNA
viruses, single-stranded DNA viruses, DNA and RNA
reverse transcribing viruses, double-stranded RNA viruses,
negative-stranded  single-stranded  RNA  viruses  and
positive-stranded single-stranded RNA viruses. In addition
there is a category of unassigned viruses and one for
subviral agents including viroids, satellites and prions.

Infection and immunity
Infectious disease is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in avian and mammalian species. Individual
body systems supply the host's respiratory, nutritional and
sensory needs, and the immune system is uniquely
equipped to provide defence against microbial or parasitic
infection irrespective of the source or the route of
transmission. Some microorganisms cause opportunistic
infections in domestic animals; other infectious agents,
termed pathogenic microorganisms, are capable of causing
serious infection if they gain entry into the body. The
immune system is composed of an array of structures, cells
and secretions which offer defence not only against
opportunistic  infections  but  also  against pathogenic
microorganisms
which
can
  cause  life-threatening
infections in susceptible animals.
The first barriers to infection that offer rapid, protective
responses are components of innate immunity. These
components include anatomical structures such as the skin
and
mucous
membranes,
inhibitory
secretions,
antimicrobial factors and phagocytic cells (Fig. 3.1). If an
infectious agent enters the tissues, material from this
invading pathogen can be presented to lymphocytes by
phagocytic cells such as macrophages. These lymphocytes
then undergo functional changes, proliferate and secrete
soluble factors which promote the involvement of other
cells of the immune system in an attempt to contain the
infection. This response on the part of lymphocytes is
87
referred to as an adaptive immune response. Moreover,
following an encounter with a microbial pathogen, the
body's immune system learns from the experience by
responding in a specific manner to the pathogen and by
‘remembering’ the  interaction.  Immunological  memory
resides in some lymphocytes that are produced in the
course of a response to an infectious agent, and these
memory cells react quickly to subsequent invasion by the
same agent. The
e immune system,  therefore, has
components that function as innate, non-specific barriers to
infectious agents, and components that exhibit specificity
combined with immunological
1memory. It provides
protection against a vast array of actual or potential
pathogens present in the immediate environment of
animals. Immune responses, however, are not confined to
infectious agents and responses to innocuous substances
such as pollens, foreign proteins and some therapeutic
drugs, can cause potentially destructive hypersensitivity
reactions. Although the primary activity of the immune
system is usually
consideredtobeassociatedwith
protection against infectious agents, it has a defined role in
immune surveillance for the detection of neo-plastic tissue
changes and, in some instances, elimination of such
undesirable mutated cells or neoplastic cells by immune
mechanisms.
Soon after birth the external surfaces of the body,
extensive portions of the alimentary tract and regions of
the respiratory and urinary tracts become colonized by
bacteria. The host and colonizing bacteria live in a
relativelypeaceful  state of  coexistence, with
microorganisms restricted to parts of the body where they
can be tolerated and microbial invasion of tissues can be
88
prevented by natural antibacterial defence mechanisms.
Bacteria that colonize tissues of the body without
producing disease constitute part of the normal flora. This
harmoniousrelationship
between
animals  and
[their
environment can be reinforced by good management
systems, optimal nutrition, adequate floor space and
effective disease control programmes (Fig. 3.2). Negative
factors that can tilt the balance in favour of potential or
actual   pathogens  include
overcrowding, uncontrolled
environmental temperature, nutritional imbalances and
absence of a welldesigned and implemented disease
control programme. Even if bacteria, fungi or viruses
succeed in entering the tissues and causing infection,
disease is not an inevitable outcome. Characteristics of the
infectious agent, environmental influences and  the
susceptibility of the infected animal usually determine the
outcome of infection. If infection is not quickly eliminated,
clinical disease or subclinical infection is the likely result
(Fig. 3.3). Characteristics of individual species of
pathogenic bacteria can strongly influence their ability to
overcome host defences and produce disease. Structural,
metabolic and other features of bacteria that promote
disease development are presented in Table 3.1.

Normal flora
Soon after birth, neonatal animals are exposed through
on the
dam. Bacteria, yeasts and
 eventually other
microorganisms from the animal's immediate environment
may colonize particular sites on the skin and regions of the
alimentary,
respiratory
or
urogenital
tracts.
Microorganisms that compete successfully for particular
sites
gradually
form
1 a stable normal
flora. Different
regions of the body may have a distinctive resident flora
suggesting
that regional
colonization
may
 reflect
a
selective
advantage
on
the
part
of
successful
microorganisms. The ability to survive acidic conditions in
the
e alimentary tract or tolerance for some naturally
occurring antimicrobial factors confers particular survival
capabilities on some resident flora. Adherence to host cells
or synthesis of metabolic substances antagonistic
to
competitors may enhance colonization of the skin, mucous
91
membranes or parts of the alimentary tract by some
bacteria and yeasts. There is evidence that the normal flora
can compete with and sometimes prevent establishment of
pathogenic microorganisms. This may be achieved by
competition for nutrients, by formation of inhibitory
substances, or by attachment to receptors on cell surfaces,
thereby preventing colonization by invading pathogens.
Although the normal flora is not directly associated with
non-specific immunity, their competitive role can be
considered beneficial for the host. In addition, normal flora
may gently challenge the naive immune system of young
animals at an early age, thereby preparing them for
subsequent encounters with virulent pathogens. As the
animal matures, the normal flora may play a vital part in
digestion, especially in ruminants. In some species, the
normal flora may contribute to synthesis of the B vitamins
and vitamin K. Prolonged therapy with antimicrobial drugs
may  interfere  with normal  intestinal  microorganisms,
permitting the survival and proliferation of organisms
resistant to the drugs used. This can lead to the emergence
of resistant strains of bacteria which may replace the
normal flora and lead to digestive upsets and disease. In
the absence of resident microorganisms in the alimentary
tract, overgrowth of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans
can occur leading to tissue invasion.

Comparative aspects of innate and adaptive immunity
During
 embryological
development,
myeloid
 and
lymphoid cells arise from a pluripotent stem cell in the
bone marrow (Fig. 3.4, Table 3.2). Myeloid cells, along
with natural killer (NK) cells, are part of the innate
immune defences. From the bloodstream, monocytes
migrate to tissues where they become either fixed or free
macrophages. Among the polymorphonuclear leukocytes,
neutrophils play the most prominent role in combating
pyogenic
bacterial
infections.
Polymorphonuclear
leukocytes move into tissues from the bloodstream in
response to release of soluble factors from damaged host
cells. In addition, soluble factors in the blood or in body
93
fluids attract inflammatory cells to developing lesions.
Two types of lymphocytes referred to as T lymphocytes
and B lymphocytes arise from a lymphoid stem cell in the
bone marrow
(Fig. 3.5). Following maturation
1n
appropriate tissues, these specialized cells, through their
secretions or direct involvement, constitute adaptive
immunity.

Innate immunity and adaptive immunity are compared in
Table 3.3. Innate resistance to infection is demonstrable in
both  vertebrates and invertebrates. 
Physical  barriers,
mechanical
1action, physiological 
factors,  soluble
antimicrobial substances and phagocytic cells contribute to
this natural resistance to infection characterized by a rapid
response but without a ‘memory’ for the pathogens
encountered. The contribution of anatomical structures and
mechanical activity to innate protection against infection
are presented in Table 3.4. Other factors that can alter
susceptibility to microbial pathogens are presented in Box
3.1. Adaptive immunity, a response to infection which is
confined to vertebrates, requires induction either through
infection or vaccination. The T and B lymphocytes which
participate in this specific response release soluble factors
called cytokines. These low molecular weight regulatory
proteins or  glycoproteins act as chemical messengers
between cells and are produced by many cell types,
especially by subsets of T lymphocytes. Antibodies, which
have a high specificity for the infectious agents that
induced their formation are produced by plasma cells
which arise from B lymphocytes (Fig. 3.6)
Innate immune responses could be considered as the first
line of defence against opportunistic pathogens whereas
95
specific immunity, although relatively slow in developing,
ultimately produces an effective response to a wide range
of virulent microorganisms. Because of the production of
memory cells, secondary responses involving B and T
 'ss   i   
comparison of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes and their
roles in adaptive immune responses is presented in Table
3.5.
Recognition of pathogens
The recognition of microbial pathogens by macrophages
and other phagocytic cells relies on germline encoded
molecules termed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
Unlike the recognition system that operates specifically in
adaptive immunity, these molecules do not undergo
somatic mutation. These receptors, present on cells of the
innate immune system, recognize conserved microbial
structures referred to as pathogen-associated microbial
patterns (PAMPs).Typical
1examplesofconserved
structures include lipoteichoic acid of Gram-positive
bacteria, lipopoly-saccharide of Gram-negative bacteria
and fungal β-glucan. Recognition of these conserved
structures enables the host to identify a wide variety of
microorganisms by means of a limited set of receptors.
Expression of these receptors can be influenced or
regulated by cytokines and other immune-modulating
agents including microbial components.  In addition to
pathogen recognition, PRRs also influence the response
mediated by macrophages and, to a large extent, determine
the nature of the immune response towards the invading
microorganism. These receptors may be present on cell
membranes, free in serum or located intracellularly.
96
Serum-derived PRRs include collectins, pentraxins and the
complement components Clq and C3. By binding to
microorganisms,
complement
tcomponentsfacilitate
recognition and attachment of pathogens to opsonic
receptors on phagocytic cells. Following the production of
specific antibodies after  the induction of adaptive
immunity, microorganisms coated with antibodies bind to
Fc receptors on phagocytes, providing another form of
opsonic recognition for cells of the immune system. Direct
recognition of microorganisms without the involvement of
opsonizing molecules can occur with C-type lectins.
leucinerich proteins, scavenger receptors and integrins.
      
can be mediated by many different PRRs, generation of the
appropriate responses has been attributed to a family of
receptors, the toll-like receptors (TLRs). These TLRs have
characteristics resembling interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor. By
acting in combinations, TLRs can distinguish various
microbial pathogens and initiate signalling cascades
similar to those induced by the IL-1 receptor that results in
the activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) present in the
cytoplasm. Activated NF-kB moves from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus, binds to transcription initiation sites and
increases the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines
such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β
andIL-12.Inadditiontothemacrophagereceptors
involved in the recognition of pathogens, there are many
other surface receptors for cytokines and chemokines
together with receptors involved in migration, adhesion
 and antigen presentation to T lymphocytes.

Cells involved in innate immune responses
From a pluripotent stem cell in the bone marrow, two
important groups of cells arise: those that belong to the
myeloid series and those that belong to the lymphoid
series. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, described as
polymorphonuclear cells, arise from myeloblasts, whereas
cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage arise from
monoblasts (Fig. 3.4). Although many cell types are
capable of engulfing particles, two cell types, macrophages
106
and neutrophils, are the phagocytic cells of greatest
relevance toinnateimmunity

When pyogenic bacteria invade the tissues, neutrophils are
the first cells to arrive at the site of inflammation.
Damaged endothelial cells at the site express adhesive
proteins which bind neutrophils. Rolling and arrest of
interactions with selectins and β -integrins that can
overcome hydrodynamic force (Ferrante, 2005). Adhesion
is followed by diapedesis when the neutrophils pass
through the endothelial cell junctions and, stimulated by
chemotactic factors such as C5a, migrate to the site of
tissue invasion. Chemotaxis is followed by adherence to
the pathogens and then phagocytosis. However, in the
absence of opsonins, phagocytosis of many bacteria is
ineffective.
Mononuclear phagocytes
Although they  share a common progenitor  cell  with
neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages are different in
many respects. Circulating monocytes move to tissues and
become resident tissue macrophages (Fig. 3.4). Tissue
macrophages occur throughout the body and have different
 ns    s  s
macrophages in the lungs, Kupffer cells in the liver,
microglial cells  in
the
brain. Unlike neutrophils
macrophages are long-lived cells that are better equipped
to internalize and eventually destroy microorganisms.
Macrophages have many important functions such as
phagocytosis, antigen presentation to T cells to initiate
specific immune responses and secretion of cytokines to
activate
lymphocytes   and
 promote
inflammatory
responses.
109
Dendritic cells
A number of cell types which can display antigen in a form
that can be recognized by T lymphocytes are referred to as
antigen-presenting cells. Although many cells that express
either MHC class I or MHC class II molecules can present
peptides to T lymphocytes and could be considered as
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), by convention the term
APCs is reserved for cells that display peptides to CD4+ T
cells (known as T helper lymphocytes) in the context of
the MHC class molecules. Cells that present peptides in
association with MHC class I molecules to CD8t T cells
(also known as cytotoxic lymphocytes) are referred to as
target  cells.  Antigen-presenting
 cells (namely
macrophages, dendritic cells and B lymphocytes) are a
heterogeneous population of leukocytes that link innate
and adaptive immune responses and play a central role in
the functional activity of T helper cells. Dendritic cells and
other cell types can have a functional role in antigen
presentation for short intervals during acute inflammatory
responses. Because they constitutively express a high level
of MHC class II molecules and also have co-stimulatory
activity, dendritic cells are considered the most effective
APCs.
Dendritic cells are a specialized group of MHC class
HI-expressing leukocytes which are found in most tissues
of the body. These cells derive from either lymphoid or
mononuclear phagocyte lineages and are present in the
skin, lymph nodes and spleen and in close association with
mucosal epithelia. Functionally, dendritic cells can be
divided into cells which process and present antigen to T
110
lymphocytes and a separate group of antigen-presenting
cells that passively present antigenic material in the form
of immune complexes to B lymphocytes in lymphoid
follicles. The latter cells are referred to as follicular
dendritic cells. Apart from follicular dendritic cells which
interact with B lymphocytes, there are at least four subsets
of dendritic cells which promote the activation and
differentiation of T lymphocytes. These subsets include
Langerhans dendritic cells (located in the epidermis),
interstitial dendritic cells, interdigitating dendritic cells and
plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Although their exact function
may vary with their anatomical location, their overall
properties confer on them the ability to initiate and direct
CD4+ T cell responses. Dendritic cells are extremely
effective at taking up and processing complex antigens for
MHC class II-restricted presentation. They are capable of
expressing a wide range of co-stimulatory molecules and
can secrete soluble mediators that promote the activation
and differentiation of T lymphocytes. Because dendritic
cells are especially sensitive to signals from pathogens and
damaged tissue, they can act as critical cells linking innate
immune responses and adaptive immunity. They can
recognize threats to the body from infectious agents and
can signal the immune system to detect and respond in an
appropriate manner.Langerhans cells found in the
epidermis and derived from a myeloid precursor typify
tissue-resident dendritic cells. These cells are relatively
immature, quiescent cells which monitor their environment
by endocytosis and phagocytosis. If exposed to products of
pathogenic  microorganisms  such  as lipopolysaccharide
flagellin, bacterial DNA or viral nucleic acid which bind to
appropriate  TLRs,  these  APCs  become  activated.
Antigenic peptides derived from processing of ingested
111
antigenic material are complexed with MHC class II
molecules and then transferred as stable peptide)MHC
class II complexes to the cell surface where they can
remain for long periods. Accompanying these activities,
dendritic cells become motile and migrate to draining
lymph nodes. Activation of dendritic cells also results in
the expression of co-stimulatory signals required for full
activation of T lymphocytes. Dendritic cells are versatile
     n  
perform diverse functions. In peripheral tissues, they act as
sentinels, sampling their environment and then transferring
antigenic material to lymphoid organs for presentation to T
lymphocytes
A distinct group of dendritic cells, referred to as follicular
dendritic cells, have characteristics that distinguish them in
both lineage and function from dendritic cells which
present antigenic material to T lymphocytes. Follicular
dendritic cells are morphologically similar in many
respects to other dendritic cells. However, these cells do
not appear to arise from myeloid or lymphoid sources and
do not express MHC class II molecules. Accordingly, they
do not function as APCs for T helper cell activation.
Another distinguishing feature of these dendritic cells is
their localization in B cell follicles, hence their assigned
name. Follicular dendritic cells present intact antigen or
antigen complexed with antibodies to B cells, sometimes
with complement components attached to the complexes.
It has been suggested that retention of immune complexes
on the surface of follicular dendritic cells may contribute
to B cell maturation and may have a role in maintaining
memory B lymphocytes.
112
Natural killer cells
Up to 15% of mammalian blood lymphocytes which are
neither T lymphocytes nor B lymphocytes belong to a
distinct population of cells, referred to as natural killer
cells (NK cells). These large granular lymphocytes exhibit
cytotoxicity for other cells but lack the type of receptors
present on T cells and B cells. Although NK cell
precursors can be isolated from the thymus, this lymphoid
organ does not have a critical role in NK cell development.
Of particular importance in NK cell development is the
cytokine IL-15 (Fig. 3.4). NK cells and cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells) share some common features.
Both cell types have a lymphoid lineage, are cytotoxic and
they
secrete
the
 pro-inflammatory
cytokine,
interferon-gamma (IFN-y). However, in many other
respects, these two cytotoxic cell types differ greatly. NK
cells are found in the circulation and in blood filtering
organs such as the spleen and liver. These cells exhibit
natural cytotoxicity against tumour cells and virus-infected
cells. During viral infections, NK cells are recruited and
activated by cytokines secreted by infected cells or
myeloid cells. Type I interferons, IL-12 and IL-15 are of
special importance in the stimulation of NK cell
production and in the activation of these cells. Despite
lacking antigen-specific receptors, NK cells can recognize
tumour cells or virus-infected cells. Potential target cells
can be recognized in two different ways. An NK cell uses
an NK-cell receptor to detect abnormalities such as
unusual surface antigens or a reduction of normal surface
molecules called   major   histocompatibility   molecules
(MHC class I). In some viral infections, infected cells
   s     
113
induce an antibody response, and antiviral antibodies bind
to the displayed viral antigens. Because NK cells have
receptors for bound antibodies, they can attach to the
antibodies on virus-infected cells and lyse them. This
cytotoxic    reaction   is    called    antibody)dependent
celhmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  In this reaction,
antibody bound to the virus-infected cell identifies such a
cell for destruction bv NK cells
Destruction of target cells by NK cells shares some
common features with cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The
cytoplasm of NK cells contains numerous granules which
store perforin and granzymes. On contact with a target cell,
the contents of the granules are released on to the surface
of the target cell, and in the presence of high extracellular
calcium levels perforin induces small lesions in the target
cell surface. These allow entry of the granzymes, which
are serine proteases, into the target cell. The serine
proteases cleave and activate cellular caspases, and this
results in target cell death by apoptosis.
Involvement of NK cells is evident at an early stage in
viral infections together with production of type 1
interferons. These two components of innate immune
responses offer considerable short-term protection against
viral  pathogens  before  adaptive
eimmuneresponses
develop. NK cells do not develop immunological memory.
Complement
The complement system consists of approximately 30
serum and membrane proteins which can mediate or
contribute to a variety of immune reactions including
114
promotion of inflammatory responses, chemotaxis,
opsonization and destruction of cell membranes and of
enveloped viruses. The soluble proteins that constitute the
complement system are synthesized at various
sites throughout the body. However, the liver is a major
site of synthesis of some components; monocytes.
macrophages and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal and
individual  components.  Most  of the membrane-bound
proteins are synthesized in the cells on which they are
expressed. The majority of complement components
circulate as functionally inactive forms as proenzymes
 
and exposes the active site of the molecule.The
the absence of antibody as part of the innate immune
response to microbial infection and also by antibodies
attached to pathogens as part of the adaptive immune
response to infectious agents. In evolutionary terms, the
complement system is regarded as a very ancient defence
mechanism that predates the development of the adaptive
immune system
Complement components are designated by numerals from
C1 to C9. The number assigned to each complement
componentrefers totheorder inwhichtheseindividual
proteins were discovered rather than to their position in the
activation sequence. The biochemical reaction sequence is
C1-C4-C2-C3-C5-C6-C7-C8-C9. Letter symbols, in upper
case letters, identify factors that interact with complement
components, and lower case letters after a complement
component are used to designate peptide fragments formed
by activation of that component. A bar over the activated
115
component indicates a fragment that possesses enzymatic
activity following cleavage. Examples of such activation

complex such as C4b, 2a, the latter referred to as C3
convertase. Activated complement components or complex
become covalentlyattached
1to cellsurfaces where
activation occurs, thereby ensuring that activation is
confined to defined sites. A small number of activated
complement components leads to the production of large
numbers of effector molecules. For this reason the
complement system is effectively regulated by a number of
circulating and cell membrane proteins.
Complement activation
There are three pathways of complement activation, two
initiated by microorganisms without the requirement for
antibody, called the alternative and lectin pathways, and a
third initiated by immune complexes, called the classical
pathway (Fig. 3.7). Components involved in the classical,
alternative and lectin pathways of complement activation
are listed in Table 3.6. The three activation pathways
converge on a common terminal pathway that leads to the
formation of the membrane attack complex which
produces transmembrane pores in the membranes of target
cells resulting in osmotic lysis of these cells
Figure 3.7
Activation of complement through the
classical, alternative and lectin pathways. The formation of
immune complexes (antibody bound to antigen) initiates
the classical pathway. Microbial surfaces can activate the
alternative pathway  and microbial carbohydrates can

proceed without the requirement for antibody.

Classical pathway
Activation of the classical complement pathway is usually
associated with immune complex formation involving IgM
or IgG antibodies. Formation of an antigen-antibody
complex induces conformational change in the Fc portion
of the antibody molecule bound to antigen, exposing a
binding site for the Cl component of the complement
system. In plasma, C1 is a large multicomponent complex.
composed of a single molecule of the recognition molecule
Clq, two molecules of the enzymatic unit Clr and two
molecules of the enzymatic unit Cls. The three subunits of
C1, namely Clq, Clr and Cls, associate with each other in
a calcium-dependent complex. Binding of Clq to the Fc
portion of the antibody results in conformational changes
in the Clq molecule which in turn induces conformational
alternations in the Clr proenzyme, causing autocatalytic
activation of the molecule. Activated Clr cleaves Cls
which exhibits serine protease activity. In the activated Ci
complex, Cls cleaves the next component of the classical
pathway, C4 into C4a and C4b. The C4b fragment attaches
to the target surface area in the vicinity of Cl and the C2
proenzyme then attaches to the exposed binding site on
C4b in the presence of magnesium ions. When C2 binds to
the complex, it is then cleaved by the adjacent Cls giving
rise to C2a and the smaller fragment C2b diffuses away.
119
The resulting C4b, 2a complex is called C3 convertase
because C2a in the complex, with its serine protease
activity, cleaves C3, the most abundant of the complement
proteins. Cleavage of C3 releases a small, biologically
active peptide, C3a, and the other fragment, C3b, binds to
the activating C4b, 2a complex creating a new enzyme C4b
, 2a, 3b, referred to as C5 convertase. The next component,
C5, attaches to C3b in the C5 convertase complex and is
cleaved by C2a into C5b which attaches to the complex
and C5a which diffuses away (Fig. 3.8).
The membrane attack or terminal pathway of complement
activation involves C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9 which interact
sequentially, forming a macromolecular structure called
the membrane attack complex. This complex forms a pore
in the membrane of the target cell which allows the free
movement of water and ions, resulting in osmotic lysis of
the target cell. Formation of the membrane attack complex
involves binding of C6 by C5b. A newly exposed binding
site in C6 enables the C5b, 6 complex to bind C7.
Attachment of C7 to the complex results in conformational
change in the trimolecular C5b, 6, 7 complex, its release
from the convertase and the formation of a binding site for
C8.Binding of
C8
8to the complex induces
6a
conformational change in C8 and this component interacts
with the plasma membrane of the target cell. The C5b, 6, 7
8 complex creates a small pore in the target cell membrane.
The final step in the formation of the membrane attack
complex is the binding and polymerization of C9 to the C
5b,6, 7, 8 complex.When C9 binds to the C5b,6,7,8
complex, it undergoes major conformational change. The
formation of  this terminal  complex exposes additional
binding sites for C9 thereby facilitating completion of the
120
membrane attack complex which becomes inserted into the
cell membrane forming a pore, clearly visible by electron
microscopy. Pore
formation in the membrane of
erythrocytes leads to osmotic lysis. Nucleated cells can
resist killing by a combination of ion pump activity and
membrane
repair.  However,  membrane
attack
complex-induced lesions can sometimes cause apoptosis in
nucleated target cells.
A feature of complement activation is the initiation of a
cascade of proteolytic events. A single C3 conver-tase
complex can generate hundreds of C3b molecules, thereby
amplifying this step of the sequence. As a consequence of
activation, complement components, fragments and
complexes play a central role in innate immune responses
to infectious agents; they also amplify the protective role
of specific antibodies to pathogenic microorganisms.
Lectin pathway
The lectin pathway, which is activated by microbial
carbohydrates, differs from the classical pathway in the
initial recognition and activation steps. Lectins are proteins
that recognize and bind to specific carbohydrate targets,
and mannose-binding lectin is a high molecular weight
serum
lectin
that
binds
to
mannose
  and
N-acetylglucosamine present in the cell walls of diverse
pathogens including bacteria, fungi and protozoa and on
the envelopes of some viruses. The enzymatic activity of
this method of  complement activation resides 
1n
mannose-binding lectin-associated
serineproteases,
MASP-1 and MASP-2 (Fig. 3.8). When mannose-binding
lectin binds to the carbohydrate residues on the surface of
121
pathogens, it induces auto-catalytic activation of MASP-1
and MASP-2, a consequence of conformational changes
resulting from particle binding. The serine protease
activity arising from this activation cleaves C4 and C2 in a
manner similar to Ci in the classical pathway as MASP-1
and MASP-2 structurally resemble Clr and Cls and their
biochemical activities are also similar. Activation of C4
and C2 without the requirement for specific antibody
represents an important innate defence mechanism
comparable to the alternative pathway but retains close
links with the classical pathway of activation. Recent
evidence indicates that ficolins, a family of lectin-like
plasma proteins, can replace mannose-binding lectin and
also form complement-activating complexes with MASP-1
and MASP-2 (Morgan, 2005).
Alternativepathway
Activation of the alternative pathway can occur efficiently
only at cell surfaces, typically microbial cell walls. This
alternative  pathway   of
complementactivationalso
provides an antibody-independent method of initiating
conversion of C3 to C3b. Normally, C3 in plasma is being
continuously cleaved at a low rate, generating C3b in a
process referred to as C3 ‘tickover'. This spontaneous
hydrolysis of C3 occurs because it contains an unstable
thioester bond. For activation of the altermative pathway,
four plasma proteins are required: C3, factor B, factor D
and properdin. When C3b is generated in the fluid phase,
two inhibitors, factors H and I, inactivate most of its
activity. Factor H binds C3b and recruits factor I which has
protease activity and cleaves C3b, abolishing its
convertase function (Fig. 3.9). However, when C3b is
122
bound to a cell surface, it first interacts with factor B and
then with factor D and the resulting complex is stabilized
by properdin. Under these conditions, factors H and I have
less inhibitory activity on C3b.

The membranes of most mammalian cells have a high
levelof sialic acidwhich contributes to the rapid
inactivation   of bound
1C3b
on
host cells. Unlike
mammalian cells, microbial surfaces such as bacterial
cells, fungal cells and some viral envelopes have low
levels of sialic acid and, accordingly, C3b bound to such
surfaces remains active for a longer time. When C3b
attaches to the surface of a microbial cell, it binds factor B
in a magnesium-dependent reaction; after it is bound,
factor B is cleaved by factor D which has serine protease
activity, generating a fragment called Bb which remains
attached to C3b with the release of a smaller fragment, Ba
124
(Fig. 3.8). The C3b, Bb complex, which has C3 convertase
activity, is analogous to the C4b,2a complex in the classical
pathway. The plasma protein properdin contributes to the
survival of C3b, Bb by binding and stabilizing the complex.
Some of the C3b molecules, generated by the alternative
pathway C3 convertase, bind to the convertase itself and
this results in the formation of a C3b, Bb, C3b complex,
which functions as the alternative pathway C5 convertase.
Cleavage of C5 into C5b, which remains associated with
the convertase, and C5a which diffuses away, is the last
proteolytic step in the alternative pathway. Incorporation
of C5b into the membrane attack complex occurs by the
same sequence of reactions as in the classical pathway.
Apart from the well recognized methods of activating the
complement pathways, additional activator substances
include viruses, components of bacterial and fungal cells
and a number of chemicals (Table 3.7).
Regulation of complement activation
Many elements of the complement system are capable of
damaging host cells as well as foreign cells and
microorganisms. To minimize damage to self, complement
activation is tightly controlled at many  stages by
regulatory plasma proteins and by membrane-bound
protein widely distributed on blood cells, endothelial cells
and other cell types. Another mechanism of regulation in
all complement pathways is the generation of highly labile
stabilized by other components. In the activation pathways,
regulators block or regulate the enzymes that cause
amplification. The first step of the classical pathway is
125
regulated by C1l inhibitor, a serine protease inhibitor
present in plasma. The Cl inhibitor forms a complex with
Clr and Cls, causing them to dissociate from Clq, thereby
preventing further activation of C4 or C2.
Control of C3 convertase is provided by factor H in the
       
classical pathway (Fig. 3.9). On the membrane of cells,
decay-accelerating factor accelerates the decay of C3
convertase. Membrane cofactor protein acts as a cofactor
          
membrane attack complex is regulated by inhibitors
present in plasma and on cell membranes. A plasma
protein, called S protein, and another plasma protein,
clusterin, contribute to the regulation of the membrane
attack complex by preventing the complex C5b, 6, 7 from
becoming inserted into the membrane of nearby cells.
Binding of C8 to the complex of C5b, 6, 7, in the fluid
phase, blocks membrane binding and prevents formation
of the membrane attack complex. Complement-mediated
lysis of cells is more effective if the source of complement
is from one species and the cells being lysed are from a
different species. If the complement and the target cells are
from the same species, inhibition occurs. The basis of this
inhibition is that a membrane protein, homologous
restriction factor or CD59, can block formation of the
       
preventing assembly of poly-C9 and its insertion into the
membrane of the target cell. Regulatory proteins of the
complement system, their distribution, the pathway
affected and functions are presented in Table 3.8.

In recent years it has become apparent that immune
complexes with bound C3b are highly efficient in
stimulating B cells. These observations arose from studies
in  complement-depleted mice and  complement-deficient
mice in which antibody responses to antigenic material
were markedly reduced. A number of mechanisms
contribute, either directly or indirectly, to these stimulatory
effects of complement fragments on B cells. Type 2
complement receptors (CR2) stimulate humoral immune
responses by enhancing B cell activation by antigen and by
promoting the trapping of immune complexes in germinal
centres. When immature B cells bind antigenic material
  ss      
bound C3d through CR2, this dual binding promotes B cell
maturation. While in lymph nodes, mature B cells interact
with opsonized antigenic material, become activated and
proliferate. Follicular dendritic cells in lymphoid organs
capture antigenic material through attached C3 fragments
and present it to activated B cells which proliferate and
differentiate into plasma cells and memory cells. The
importance of C3d in the generation of an efficient
antibody response is now being utilized in immunization
studies where C3d coupled to antigen acts as a molecular
adjuvant.
The binding of complement components and their
fragments to cell receptors mediates many of the biological
activities  of   the complement
system.Although
complement receptors are present on many cell types, they
are especially prominent on neutrophils, monocytes.
macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, mast cells and
basophils (Table 3.9). Accordingly, opsonization, binding
to phagocytic cells and phagocytosis feature prominently
130
in the functions of these cell receptors. Degranulation of
mast cells and basophils by the small cleavage fragments
of C3 and C5, namely C3a and C5a, results in the release
of
vasoactive
amines
including
histamine
eand
5-hydroxytryptamine    which
cause
smooth muscle
contraction  and   increased  vascular permeability  and
contribute to the inflammatory response. Because of
their ability to release vasoactive amines from mast cells
and basophils and to mimic anaphylactic reactions, C3a
and C5a are sometimes referred to as anaphylatoxins. The
activity of these anaphylatoxins is curtailed by a plasma
enzyme, carboxypeptidase-N, which cleaves the carboxy
terminal amino acid arginine from both of these fragments,
rendering C3a inactive and decreasing the activity of C5a.
Binding of C3b to immune complexes composed of virions
and antibodies opsonizes the complex and promotes
phagocytosis. Complement binding can interfere with the
ability of a virus to interact with the membrane of a target
cell, thereby preventing viral entry into the cell. Many
enveloped viruses can be lysed by the membrane attack
complex  which damages 
the envelope andleadsto
disintegration of the nucleocapsid. The composition of the
cell wall influences the susceptibility of bacteria to lysis by
the membrane attack complex. The thick peptidoglycan
layer of the Gram-positive bacteria confers resistance to
the terminal complement components. Although there are
notable exceptions, most Gram-negative bacteria are
susceptible to complement-mediated lysis.
The number of immunological reactions in which the
complement system participates sets it apart from other
components of innate immunity. In addition, complement
131
has a central role in the promotion of antibody responses to
infectious agents and in amplifying the protective role of
antibody  against  microbial pathogens.  Deficiencies of
complement components, which are reviewed in Chapter
4, render affected humans and animals susceptible to a
range of microbial  infections.  Many   immunological
reactions which are essential for defence against microbial
pathogens are mediated by  complement  components,
fragments or complexes (Table 3.10)
Characteristics   of   complement
 components
and
complement levels in different species of animals
The labile nature of complement has been known since the
time of its discovery, more than 1o0 years ago. Heating
        
The ability of the complement system of different species
to lyse red blood cells sensitized with antibody shows wide
variation. Bovine, ovine, canine, feline and porcine sera
have moderate to low levels of haemolytic activity. Human
serum has a comparatively high level of complement and
guinea pig serum has an exceptionally high level of
complement activity. To ensure the optimal participation
of complement components in serological tests, diluents
should supply adequate concentrations of calcium and
magnesium 1ons.
The  antimicrobial  activity   of  cellular and  soluble
components of innate immunity
Early recognition of invading microbial pathogens is
essential for the mobilization of innate defences. Many
microbial pathogens have distinctive macromolecules on
132
distinctive molecular structures, which are called
pathogen-associated molecular pattermns, can be recognized
     s   
system (Table 3.11). The cell types that participate in
innate immune responses are not equally effective against
bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. Neutrophils are
particularly effective against bacteria and fungi. NK cells
have an important role in the recognition and destruction
of virus-nfected cells. The ability of interferons to inhibit
viral replication at the early stages of virus infections
before adaptive immune responses develop is of particular
importance in antiviral immunity. When activated, the
promote their destruction through phagocytosis or by the
initiation of inflammatory responses. Cellular and soluble
components of innate immunity and the categories of
microbial   pathogens  affected   by   their   antimicrobial
activity are presented in Table 3.12.
Adaptive immunity
At a particular stage in its development, the foetus acquires
the ability to recognize foreign antigenic material and to
respond to infectious agents encountered in utero.
Newborn animals, transferred from a sterile intrauterine
environment to a world abounding in microorganisms,
have aninnateability to resist invasionby many
environmental organisms.  Without  colostral  protection,
however, neonatal animals are susceptible to many enteric
and respiratory pathogens. As an animal matures, its
immune system develops in tandem with other anatomical
and physiological alterations. Within weeks of birth, most
133
young animals are immunologically competent and, if
challenged by infectious agents, they can respond in an
appropriate manner to prevent or limit tissue invasion.
The immune system can distinguish ‘self components
from foreign material such as cells or soluble substances
introduced into the body. This recognition of ‘self' and
tolerance to its own tissue antigens occurs during
embryological development. In exceptional circumstances,
some individual animals produce an immune response
against their own tissues and this condition is termed
autoimmunity.
Lymphocytes can interact with foreign material through
surface receptors. On B cells, the receptors are
membrane-bound immunoglobulins. In contrast, T cell
receptors are not immunoglobulins and can only react with
antigen in association with other molecules. Lymphocyte
receptors can recognize a diverse range of foreign
molecules including the components or products of
bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and helminth parasites.
These foreign substances are collectively referred to as
antigens. An antigen can be defined as any substance
capable of binding specifically to components of the
immune system such as specific antibodies or T cell
receptors. An immunogen is any agent or substance
capable  of  inducing
an
immune
response.This
differentiation of antigens and immunogens is necessary
because some low-molecular-weight compounds, referred
to as haptens, which include breakdown products of some
antibiotics, cannot induce immune responses unless
coupled with large molecules such as proteins. Haptens,
however, can bind to components of the immune system
134
specifically produced against them. For a substance to be
immunogenic, it must have certain characteristics. These
include foreignness, high molecular weight, chemical
complexity and biodegradability. In general, compounds
that have molecular weights less than 1,ooo Da are not
immunogenic, whereas those
with molecular weights
between 1,000 and 6,000 Da
may be immunogenic in some instances. Compounds with
molecular weights greater than 6,ooo Da are usually
immunogenic. Proteins are highly immunogenic and
carbohydrates moderately immunogenic, whereas lipids
and nucleic acids are usually poor immunogens.

Structure and organization of lymphoid tissue
140
In contrast to the innate immune system, which uses a
limited number of genetically encoded receptors such as
PRRs and TLRs, the adaptive immune system utilizes
subsets of lymphocytes, which have the ability to generate
a large number of antigen-specific cell surface receptors by
random gene rearrangement.  Lymphoid structures are
divided into primary and secondary lymphoid organs. In
mammals, the primary lymphoid organs are the thymus,
where specialized lymphoid differentiation  takes place,
and the bone marrow, the origin of lymphoid stem cells
and also the location in which specialized lymphocyte

occurs.
Thymus-derived
lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, develop T cell receptors for
recognizing antigen and collectively these cells are

possess special antigen receptors, B-cell receptors, and,

specificity, B cells differentiate into plasma cells which
produce specific antibody. As a consequence of this
interaction, some B cells form memory cells which retain
the ability to recognize antigen and respond rapidly to a
second or subsequent encounter with the same antigen. In
avian species, T lymphocyte development takes place in
the thymus but B lymphocyte differentiation occurs in the
cloacal bursa, formerly called the bursa of Fabricius. When
naive lymphocytes have completed their differentiation in
primary lymphoid
d organs, they migrate to secondary
lymphoid organs.
141
The secondary lymphoid organs include the spleen
peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue including the tonsils, and gut-associated
lymphoid tissue such as Peyer's patches. Because of their
location and activity these lymphoid organs fulfil different
roles. The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue limits the
progress of infectious agents which enter the body through
mucosal surfaces. Peripheral lymph nodes collect and offer
protection against pathogens detected in body fluids.The
spleen and, to a lesser extent, the Kupffer cells in the liver
remove blood-borne infectious agents, degenerating cells
and foreign antigenic material. Although morphologically
different, lymphoid organs serve a common defence
purpose. Because they are positioned at sites where
      s 
B lymphocytes, secondary lymphoid organs have a central
role in the initiation of specific immune responses. In
military terms, they are akin to strategically located
garrisons, detecting and responding in a specific manner to
microbial invasion.
Lymphocytes
All lymphocytes arise from a common stem cell in the
bone marrow (Cumano and Godin, 2007). On the basis of
function and cell membrane components, lymphocytes can
be broadly subdivided into three major populations namely
B cells, T cells and natural killer cells (Fig. 3.4). Before T
or B lymphocytes encounter antigen, they are referred to as
naive or unprimed cells. Interaction with antigen induces
change; these cells enlarge and develop into lymphoblasts.
Ultimately, lymphoblasts differentiate into effector cells or
142
memory cells. The name assigned to lymphocytes reflects
the tissue or organ in which they mature after leaving the
bone marrow or, in the case of natural killer cells, their
immunological activity. Thus, the designation T cell
relates to lymphocytes that mature in the thymus, and the
name B cell relates to lymphocytes that mature in the avian
cloacal bursa or its equivalent in mammals, the bone
lymphocyte maturation may take place include Peyer's
patches or other gut-associated lymphoid tissues.
Although lymphocytes are morphologically heterogeneous,
B and T cells can be differentiated by their antigen
receptors and by characteristics of their surface markers
Up to 70% of lymphocytes in peripheral blood are T cells.
The primary role of B lymphocytes is antibody production
Each B cell is genetically programmed to express a surface
receptor for a particular antigen. When stimulated by
antigen for which they
have receptors, B cells differentiate into plasma cells
which produce large amounts of specific antibody. In
addition, B lymphocytes can process antigen and present it
to T cells, thereby initiating or enhancing specific immune
responses. Mature T lymphocytes express characteristic
markers which can be used for their identification. These
cells, which comprise functionally distinct populations, are
involved in the activation of many cell types including B
lymphocytes, macrophages and other cells involved in
inflammatory responses. Subsets of T cells express
different markers and, through the release of cytokines, T
lymphocytes are responsible for the activation and control
of many specific immune responses. One subset of T cells
can recognize and kill host cells infected with viruses,
143
tumour cells and foreign cells such as tissue grafts
Lymphocytes which are distinct from T and B
lymphocytes, referred to as natural killer (NK) cells, have
some characteristics in common with T cells but do not
exhibit  antigenic  specificity.  These
largegranular
lymphocytes are part of the innate immune system and do
not express clonally distributed antigen receptors such as
immunoglobulin receptors or T cell receptors.
The only cells in the body capable of recognizing antigenic
determinants in a highly specific manner are T and B
lymphocytes. In addition, these lymphocytes produce
memory cells following an encounter with antigenic
material. Accordingly, specificity and memory are two
fundamental features of adaptive immune responses. As a
consequence of immunological memory, a more effective
immune response
 occurs on second or subsequent
encounters with an infectious agent than on primary
exposure. This contrasts with innate immune responses
which do not alter following repeated exposure to the same
infectious agent.
Subsets of lymphocytes and their contribution to adaptive
immunity
Adaptive immune responses occur in two phases.
recognition of the infectious agent's surface antigens and
the development of specific immune responses aimed at
clearing the microbial pathogen from the tissues. In the
first phase, selection of lymphocytes involves the
recognition of antigen with subsequent clonal expansion of
T and B lymphocytes which have surface receptors for the
antigen. In the second phase, differentiation of the
144
lymphocytes into effector cells and memory cells results in
the development of humoral and cell-mediated responses.
These specific responses lead to the neutralization or
elimination of the infectious agent and the development of
memory cells which can respond rapidly to second or
subsequent encounters with the microbial pathogen.
Subsets of T lymphocytes
Lymphocytes
  are
heterogeneous,
phenotypically
functionally and morphologically. There are two well
defined subpopulations of T cells, T helper (TH) cells and
cytotoxic T cells (Tc). In recent years, two additional
subsets of T cells, T helper 17 (TH17) and regulatory T
cells (TREG), have been identified (DeFranco et al., 2007).
Subsets of T lymphocytes can be distinguished by their
expression  of membrane   molecules  recognized  by
monoclonal   antibodies.  Unlike  polyclonal   antibodies
which can react with a wide
erange of antigenic
determinants, monoclonal antibodies react with a particular

membrane glycoproteins. Most CD4+ T cells are T helper
cells; lymphocytes which are CD8+ generally function as
cytotoxic T cells. Lymphocytes with regulatory activity are
identified by the presence of both CD4 and CD25 markers
145
on their membranes. These TREG cells tend to suppress
immune responses and unlike TH cells which promote
immune reactivity, act as cellular regulators of the immune
system. All T cells express antigen-binding T cell
receptors which functionally resemble membrane-bound
antibodies on B lymphocytes but differ from them
structurally. The T cell antigen receptor is a heterodimer
composed of an aβ or y& polypeptide pair associated with
the CD3 molecular complex. Most T lymphocytes express
the αβ T cell receptor (TCR); some express the y& TCR
(Fig. 3.5). The receptors that interact with peptide antigens
which are processed and presented on the surface of
antigen-presenting cells are clonally distributed on CD4+
and CD8t T lymphocytes. Before antigenic material can
be recognized by the TCR, it must be bound to major
histocompatibility complex molecules on the surface of the
antigen-presenting cell. While membrane-bound antibodies
on B lymphocytes can recognize native macromolecules
such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, T
cell receptors recognize antigen only when it is bound to
membrane
glycoproteins
encoded

major
histocompatibility complex. These molecules, which are

diverse
glycoproteins
found
oncell
membranes, present fragments of antigen on the cell
surface where it can be recognized by the TCR. Before
antigens can be recognized by T cells, they must be
processed or degraded and the determinants
identified by the TCRs are fragments of the original
antigenic material.
. Processing of antigen refers to
degradation of the antigenic material  into peptide
fragments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
is a collection of genes arranged within a continuous
stretch of DNA encoding three classes of molecules
146
including the peptide-binding molecules recognized by T
lymphocytes. MHC class I genes encode glycoproteins
expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells. The
major function of class I gene products is the presentation
of antigen to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD8t cells. MHC
class II genes encode glycoproteins expressed primarily on
antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic
cells and B cells. These antigen-presenting cells present
processed antigenic peptides to T helper cells, CD4+ T
cells (Snyder, 2007). MHC class II genes encode secreted
molecules with immune functions such as cytokines and
components of the complement system.
MHC class I and class II molecules bind peptides derived
from different sources. While MHC class I molecules bind
peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, referred to as
endogenous proteins, MHC class II molecules bind to
peptides derived from extracellular proteins which have

  a  s   s 
the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum where they
interact  with MHC  class I molecules. From the
endoplasmic reticulum, MHC class I molecules and bound
peptides are transported to the surface of the cell for
recognition by the TCR of CD8t T cells. Following
recognition of antigen-MHC complexes by CD8+ T cells,
these
lymphocytes   undergo 
proliferation
and
differentiation into cytotoxic T cells or into memory cells.
Cytotoxic T cells have a vital role in monitoring host cells
147
and eliminating cells which display foreign antigen
complexed  with MHC class I molecules such as
virus-infected  cells.  T helper cells recognize antigen
associated with MHC class II molecules. Following
activation by interaction with appropriate antigen-MHC
complexes, TH cells differentiate into effector cells which
initiate and promote immune responses. These CD4+
ymphocytes   activate
macrophages, B lymphocytes,
cytotoxic T lymphocytes and other cell types which
participate in immune responses. Based on the range of
cytokines that they secrete, CD4+ effector cells can be
divided into a THl subset and a TH2 subset. The THl
subset secretes IL-2, IL-3, IFN-y and TNF-β and is
responsible for classical cell-mediated functions such as
activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and delayed-type
hypersensitivity reactions. The other subset, TH2, secretes
IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13. A third subset, TH17,
has been described recently (Miossec et al., 2009). It is
likely that a common precursor cell exists that can
differentiate into a T helper cell, and it is probable that the
cytokine environment in which the antigen-primed T
helper cell differentiates determines the subset that
develops.   Additional   factors
which
influence
differentiation of TH cells include the sites of antigen
presentation and type of antigen-presenting cells involved
and the cytokines which they produce. Ultimately,
cytokine balance is the major influence in determining
CD4+ T cell differentiation. Dendritic cells and, to a lesser
extent, macrophages are the sources of IL-12 which is
essential for the development of CD4+ THl cells.
Interleukin-4 is essential for the development of TH2
responses. The differentiation of antigen- stimulated T
cells into the TH2 subset is dependent on IL-4, which
148
functions by activating STAT6, a transcription factor
which stimulates TH2 development. The TH2 subset,
which develops
in response to allergic diseases and helminth infections,
produces IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 and promotes
eosinophil and mast cell activation and production of IgE
antibodies. There is mutual antagonism between Thl and
TH2  pathways of  development and differentiation.
Through their pattern of cytokine secretion, T helper cell
subsets exert a positive influence on lymphocytes which
produce cytokines required for their own development;
thev exert a negative influence on the other subset. Thus.
production of IL-4 has a positive influence on TH2
development and
a
 negative
influenceonTHl
development. Likewise, production of IL-12 promotes TH1
development while depressing TH2 development. Stimuli
differentiation include the amount of antigen presented, the
nature of the antigen-presenting cells and the influence of
co-stimulatory molecules. Differentiation of CD4+ T cells
into the CD4+ THl subset is strongly influenced by
infection with
many
intracellular   bacteria   such    as
Mycobacterium species and Listeria monocytogenes and
also by infection with a number of pathogenic protozoa.
Appropriate
adjuvants
preferentially
stimulate
development of THl helper cells. A feature of many
intracellular pathogens and some adjuvants is that they
elicit IL-l2 production by cells of the innate immune
system. Some pathogenic microorganisms which interact
with toll-like receptors on macrophages and dendritic cells
directly stimulate these cells to secrete IL-l2. Other
microbial  pathogens   may   indirectly   promote   IL-12
secretion by stimulating NK cells to produce IFN-y which,
149
when it acts on macrophages, induces production of IL-12
The major  cytokine involved
din the induction of
cellmediated immunity is IL-12: it binds to receptors on
antigen-stimulated  CD4+ T  cells and activates  the
transcription factor STAT4 which promotes differentiation
of these cells into THl cells. Another transcription factor
termed T-bet, which is induced by IFN-y, augments THl
development. Interferons, particularly IFN-, also promote
TH1 development not only by stimulating production of
IL-12 by macrophages 
  but  also  by  promoting

Functional role of T lymphocyte subsets in adaptive
immune responses
Antibodies produced by activated Blymphocytes can
neutralize viruses and bacterial toxins and, through the
secretion of IgA on mucosal surfaces, can protect the
respiratory and alimentary tracts against microbial attack
(Snoeck et al., 2006). The protective role of antibody.
however, is limited to extracellular pathogens, and
humoral  immunity  is  ineffective  against microbial  and
parasitic pathogens which replicate within phagocytic or
non-phagocytic host cells. Protection against intracellular
pathogens including
viruses,
bacteria   such 
as
Mycobacterium bovis and Listeria monocytogenes, and
fungal pathogens such as Histoplasma capsulatum, is
dependent on effective cell-mediated immune responses
which involve both T helper cells and cyto-toxic T
lymphocytes. If, following intracellular infection by a
microbial pathogen, the infected cells are unable to kill the
invading infectious agent, the only means of eradication of
infection is by destruction of  the infected cells.
Accordingly, cell-mediated immunity is an essential part
of adaptive immune responses to infectious agents. It also
has a central role in allograft rejection and anti-tumour
immunity.
Production, structure and biological activities of antibodies
When a B cell that has not previously encountered an
antigen binds to antigen through its membrane-bound
antibody molecules, this binding activates the B cell and
causes it to divide rapidly. This activated B cell
differentiates into effector cells called plasma cells and
151
also into memory B cells. Plasma cells secrete antibodies
which enter the circulation. These antibody-secreting cells,
which do not divide, are end-stage cells and usually secrete
antibodies for up to 2 weeks. Unlike plasma cells, memory
B cells have a long life span and they express the same
membrane-bound antibody  as their  parent  B  cells.
Antibodies are glycoprotein molecules present in the
gamma globulin fraction of serum. These molecules are
members of the immunoglobulin family of serum proteins
There are five classes or isotypes of immunoglobulins,
each with characteristic structural features and with
particular immunological activities (Table 3.13). Despite
the distinctive immunological features of immunoglobulin
classes and their diverse biological activities, they share
common  structural  arrangements and  their functional
activity can be related to their molecular structure
Immune responses are initiated when an animal encounters
foreign antigenic material, often an infectious agent.
Within days, the infected animal responds by producing
antibody molecules specific for the antigenic determinants
of the infectious
agentand
by
expansionand
differentiation of antigen-specific regulatory and effector T
lymphocytes. As a
consequence of the encounter,
lymphocytes with
an
immunologicalmemory are
produced. If challenged later by the same infectious agent,
a more rapid and sustained antibody response occurs (Fig.
3.1l).A similar enhanced and more effective T cell
response usually occurs in secondary immune responses.
This is the basis of vaccination which ensures a rapid and
usually protective immune response to antigenic material,
injected or otherwise administered to susceptible animals.

Immunity to bacteria
Many different species of bacteria are present in different
regions of an animal's body, with particularly high
concentrations present on the skin and in the alimentary
tract. Most of these bacteria are commensals which coexist
with the host without inducing adverse effects. Bacteria,
yeasts and other microorganisms colonize particular sites
on the skin and regions of the alimentary and urogenital
tracts. Based on their distribution on or within the body.
their interaction with host tissues and their influence on the
functioning of body systems, bacteria can be arbitrarily
considered as part of the normal flora, opportunistic
pathogens

pathogenic
bacteria.
These 
bacterial
categories are not absolute as they depend not only on the
characteristics of the infectious agent but also on the
immune status of the host. Bacteria which colonize defined
regions of the body without producing disease constitute
part of the normal flora. Unlike the normal flora,
156
pathogenic bacteria have the ability to invade tissues,
elaborate toxins and produce disease. Even if pathogenic
bacteria succeed in entering the tissues and causing
infection, disease is not inevitable. Following tissue

mobilized to contain the infection and eliminate the
microbial pathogens. Anatomical structures including the
skin and mucous membranes offer physical protection
against bacterial invasion, while antimicrobial factors in
body fluids and phagocytic cells offer effective protection
against many bacterial pathogens. Antibodies and T
lymphocytes, components of specific adaptive immunity,
offer more effective and prolonged protection against
bacterial pathogens than innate defences. Cell-mediated
and antibody-mediated immune responses are required for
protective  immunity against  intracellular pathogens,
encapsulated
1organismsand
toxigenic
bacteria
Cooperative interactions between innate defences and
adaptive immune responses are often required to ensure
effective protection against virulent bacterial pathogens.
Innate immunity to bacterial infections
The skin, mucous membranes, mucociliary clearance and
inhibitory secretions including gastric acid and bile, and
fatty acids in the skin, contribute to protection against
pathogenic bacteria. A well-established normal flora in the
alimentary tract renders colonization by enteric pathogens
more difficult than in neonatal animals or in animals on
prolonged   antimicrobial  therapy. Pathogenic bacteria
capable of causing systemic infections must compete with
normal commensal bacteria to colonize tissues in sufficient
numbers to
157
produce disease. The normal flora can also produce
antimicrobial factors such as bacteriocins. Antimicrobial
drugs administered to animals with bacterial infections can
disrupt the normal flora colonizing mucosal surfaces and
facilitate  tissue colonization by bacterial pathogens
resistant to particular antimicrobial therapy. Viral invasion
of epithelial tissues in the respiratory tract or alimentary
tract provides an opportunity for tissue invasion by
pathogenic bacteria.
A central question relating to the functioning of the
immune system is how infectious agents are recognized
and distinguished from the vast number of environmental
substances encountered by the body. For many years, it
had been suggested that innate immunity was non-specific
and offered limited protection against infectious agents. As
knowledge of the functioning of the immune system
progressed, it became evident that components of innate
immunity can recognize structures shared by infectious
agents which are not present on host cells. Bacteria, fungi
and viruses can be recognized by receptors present on host
cell membranes, within cells and also by secreted
molecules. These
e receptors, referred to  as patterm
recognition receptors, bind to structures common to
pathogenic microorganisms, and lead to cellular responses
that are central to the functioning of the innate immune
system. Among the important structures recognized by
pattern
recognition
receptors are  peptidoglycans,
lipopolysaccharide, double-stranded RNA and mannose
residues. Unlike receptors expressed by cells of specific
adaptive immunity, receptors of the innate immune system
are encoded in the germline and are not produced by
somatic mutation of genes. Consequently, they are
158
distributed on cells of the same lineage. In comparison to
the enormous diversity of receptors on lymphocytes for
adaptive immune responses, receptors of innate immunity
have limited diversity. Because receptors on cells which
participate in innate immune responses are encoded in the
germline, cells of a particular type, such as macrophages,
express identical receptors for pathogenic microorganisms.
Accordingly, many cells responding to bacterial infections
may recognize the same structures on the invading
pathogens. The innate immune system responds in the
same manner to repeated encounters with the same
microbial pathogens.  In contrast, because of the
development of immunological memory, adaptive immune
responses increase in intensity with successive encounters
with the same pathogenic microorganisms.
         
the recognition of bacterial pathogens are present on
macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, epithelial cells
and endothelial cells (Table 3.11). The consequences of
recognition of microbial agents by the innate immune
system depend on the tissue involved and the recognition
system activated. Increased production of antimicrobial
peptides, secretion of mediators involved in inflammatory
responses, activation of complement and chemotaxis of
phagocytes to the site of tissue invasion are typical innate
responses    to   localized   bacterial infection.  The
inflammatory response to the invading bacteria is
enhanced by release of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and
tumour necrosis factor-o and of acute phase proteins,
including C-reactive protein.
Antimicrobial peptides

are concentrated in sites where there is marked bacterial
activity. In neutrophils these compounds contribute to the
killing of engulfed bacteria. Defensins and cathelicidins
are two important groups of antimicrobial peptides with
activity against a wide range of bacterial pathogens. The
two classes of defensins, a-defensins and β-defensins, have
similar structures and prevent bacterial colonisation at
particular sites. o-Defensins are present in the primary
granules of neutrophils and are produced by Paneth cells at
the base of the crypts of the small intestine. They are also
produced  in  the  epithelium of
f therespiratory and
reproductive tracts. β-Defensins are produced by epithelial
cells in the oral mucosa, salivary glands and skin and along
the respiratory and reproductive tracts. Cathelicidins are
present in the granules of neutrophils and also in
macrophages, mast cells and pulmonary epithelial cells.
Antimicrobial peptides have the ability not only to damage
bacterial and fungal cells but also to attract neutrophils and
dendritic cells to sites of infection and contribute to the
initiation of adaptive immune responses.
Lysozyme
One of many antimicrobial factors present in body fluids,
lysozyme is a highly cationic, low molecular weight
protein. Lysozyme acts directly on the cell wall of
Gram-positive  bacteria  and  enzymatically  cleaves  the
bonds between N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic
160
acid which stabilizes the peptidoglycan layer. The cell
walls of Gram-negative bacteria are protected from the
action of lysozyme by the outer membrane which masks
the underlying peptidoglycan layer. However, lysozyme
can  cleave the peptidoglycan  layer of Gram-negative
bacteria if this layer
is exposed by the membrane attack complex of the
complement system. Lysozyme is present in the granules
of neutrophils and is a secretory product of macrophages.
It is present in most body fluids, including saliva and tears.
Lactoferrin
The availability of iron is essential for the growth of many
pathogenic  bacteria  including  Staphylococcus aureus.
Pasteurella multocida and E. coli. Sequestration of iron can
therefore have an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth,
especially for intracellular bacteria.
Lactoferrin, a member of the transferrin family present in
exocrine secretions, is an iron-binding protein released by
degranulating neutrophils. This protein sequesters iron
from the plasma and tissues. Reduction of the amount of
iron available for bacterial pathogens limits their ability to
multiply. For some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, reduced availability of iron interferes with
biofilm formation. Gastric pepsin hydrolysis of lactoferrin
generates lactoferricin, a peptide with potent antibacterial
activity.
Peroxidase activity, present in many mucosal secretions,
derives from lactoperoxidase synthesized in exocrine
glands and secreted on to mucosal surfaces. Neutrophils
161
also contribute to peroxidase activity through secretion of
myeloperoxidase. The protective effect of peroxidases is
due to their role in catalysing the peroxidation of halides,
particularly chlorine and iodine, thereby generating
reactive products with marked antimicrobial activity.
Phagocytic cells
Cells that participate in the recognition, removal and
destruction of bacterial invaders are referred to as
phagocytes. Neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and
dendritic cells are the principal cell types involved in
phagocytosis, a process in which relatively large particles
such as bacteria or yeasts are engulfed by these phagocytic
cells. Phagocytosis is a receptor-mediated process in which
specific recognition of a particle by receptors on a
phagocytic cell leads to the engulfment of the particle and
fusion of the vesicle containing the engulfed item with
specialized intracellular organelles. The stages involved in
phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria include activation,
chemotaxis and attachment of the organism followed by
ingestion and destruction of the bacteria. Pathogenic
bacteria are not uniformly susceptible to phagocytosis. In
the absence of opsonins, encapsulated bacteria can resist
phagocytosis and multiply uninhibited in tissues.
Neutrophils
The ability to ingest and kill pathogenic bacteria is an
essential component of host defence. Neutrophils provide a
major defence against a wide range of Grampositive and
Gram-negative  bacteria.   Although    they   have   short
half-lives ranging from hours to a few days, these cells not
162
only participate in phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria but
they also produce a range of antimicrobial substances
including lysozyme, catheli-cidins and defensins. In
response to many types of infections, especially bacterial
infections, the bone marrow releases large numbers of
neutrophils and these cells are usually the first to arrive at
the site of tissue invasion. This transient increase in the
number of circulating neutrophils, termed leukocytosis, is
often interpreted as an imdication of an  infectious
condition. Although neutrophils may contribute to innate
immunity through the production of many important
antibacterial substances, the predominant role of these
cells is the phagocytosis and destruction of microbial
pathogens, particularly pathogenic bacteria.
Within minutes of tissue injury, there is increased blood
flow to the affected area accompanied by increased
vascular permeability, release of chemoat-tractants and
transendothelial migration of phagocytes to the site. Three
families of surface proteins, selectins, integrins and
intercellular adhesion molecules, contribute to neutrophil
arrival at the site of inflammation. Rolling is mediated by
weak binding of glycoproteins on the neutrophil surface to
selectins on endothelial cells. Under the influence of
confor-mational changes occur in integrin molecules on
the phagocytes which enable them to bind firmly to
intercellular adhesion molecules on  the surface of
endothe-lial cells. Subsequently, in a process called
diapedesis, the neutrophils move between the endothelial
cells and arrive at the site of bacterial invasion. Before
neu-trophils migrate across the endothelium to the site of
inflammation, chemokines activate circulating neu-trophils
163
and induce them to bind to the endothelium. Two
chemokines, IL-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein
12, bind to receptors on neutrophils and increase their
affinity  for intercellular adhesion molecules on the
endothelium. Following
  transendothe-lial   migration,
neutrophils are attracted to the site of infection by
gradients of chemoattractants.
Complement fragments such as C3a and C5a, leu-kotrienes
and bacterial peptides containing N- formyl peptides and
locally produced chemokines and
cytokines bind to specific receptors on neutrophils and
contribute to their directed migration to the damaged
tissue.  Neutrophils
S express surface receptors which
recognize bacterial pathogens in the blood and tissues.
Toll-like receptors, complement receptors and receptors
for N-formylmethionyl peptides function as receptors for
bacterial pathogens
s which lead to phagocytosis and
destructionof invading
bacteria.
Recognition and
adherence of bacteria to neutrophils lead to engulfment of
these microbial pathogens and this process is facilitated by
a variety of protein molecules especially specific antibody
and components of the complement system. Substances
that facilitate the ingestion of bacteria by phagocytes are
termed opsonins and the process involved is referred to as
opsonization. Neutrophils have receptors for C3b and the
Fc portion of IgG. Other opsonins include C-reactive
proteins and mannose-binding lectin. Neutrophils ingest
opsonized bacteria into a vesicle termed a phagosome,
where they are destroyed. The sequential steps in
phagocytosis involve the formation of pseudopodia which
extend around the bacteria. These structures meet and fuse,
forming a phagosome. The phagosome fuses with
164
lysosomes, becoming
g a  phagolysosome  containing
antimicrobial proteins. Lysosomal enzymes digest the
engulfed material  which is degraded and subsequently
released from  the 
 phagocyte. Neutrophils have an
antimicrobial armoury stored in two types of granules,
primary and secondary.  These phagocytic  cells also
contain other types of granules and secretory vesicles. The
contents of primary granules include acid hydrolases,
myeloperoxidase, elastase, cathepsin  G,  (

Secondary granules contain lactoferrin, lysozyme and a
number of other components. Killing of engulfed bacteria
is accomplished by two major antimicrobial systems, one
oxygen independent and the other oxygen dependent
Non-oxidative killing of bacterial pathogens involves
defensins, cathepsin G and lysozyme. The oxidative
systems of bacterial destruction involve the generation of
reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species.
Oxygen consumed by phagocytic cells to support the
 generation of reactive oxygen species is provided by what
is referred to as the respiratory burst, characterized by a
marked uptake of oxygen. The principal toxic factors
generated include superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide.

Reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide generates reactive
nitrogen species.  Myeloperoxidase is present in high
concentrations in primary granules. During phagocytosis.
activation of the respiratory burst is accompanied by
degranulation  with release of hydrogen peroxide and
myeloperoxidase into the phagosome. Other toxic factors
produced include chloramines, hydroxyl radicals and
singlet oxygen. Many antibacterial substances are present
165
in body fluids and tissues but ultimately most pathogenic
bacteria are killed by phagocytic cells such as neutrophils
Macrophages
Unlike neutrophils, which have a short life span but are
efficient phagocytic cells, macrophages are long-lived
cells. Macrophages are not only phagocytic cells but also
provide immune surveillance in tissues and participate as
effective cells in adaptive immune responses. Some occur
as fixed cells in tissues, others as migratory cells. Tissue
macrophages have  different
 names   and   functions
depending on their location: alveolar macrophages in the
lungs, Kupffer cells in the liver and microglial cells in the
brain. In the liver, Kupffer cells play a central role in
clearing bacteria from the bloodstream. Besides killing and
clearing bacterial pathogens, macrophages also have a
central role in the coordination of other cells and tissues of
the immune system. They exert their influence by the
secretion of a number of cytokines including IL-1, IL-6.
IL-8, IL-18, IFN-α and TNF-α. Macrophages and their
circulating precursors, monocytes, have an array of pattermn
acid of Gram-positive bacteria,  lipopoly-saccharide of
Gram-negative bacteria and β-glucan of fungal pathogens.
Phylogenetically, macrophage-type cells are among the
oldest mediators of innate immunity. Unlike neutrophils,
macrophages continue to differentiate after they leave the
bone marrow and they can become activated if stimulated
in an appropriate manner. Although macrophages and
neutrophils share some common features as phagocytic
cells, macrophages occupy a more central role in innate
immuneresponses
than
neutrophils,   and
as
166
antigen-presenting cells they contribute to the initiation of
adaptive immune responses through the activation of T
lymphocytes.
Phagocytosis by macrophages is initiated by binding of
transmembrane activation signals that result in  their
engulfment. When bacteria are opsonized by antibody or
complement components, phagocytosis is enhanced. After
ingestion, maturation of the phagosome occurs through a
series of sequential steps. The phagosome acquires
hydrolytic enzymes such as cathepsin-D and its pH drops
Late stages of maturation involve fusion with lysosomes
which results in the formation of a phagolysosomal
structure containing a range of degradative lysosomal
hydrolases. The
entire process of maturation results in the generation of an
antimicrobial  environment  in   which destruction   and
digestion of the engulfed microbial pathogen takes place.
Reactive  oxygen
intermediates,
arisingfromthe
respiratory burst of macrophages, contribute to the
destruction of ingested bacteria. Superoxide ions, hydroxyl
radicals and hydrogen peroxide, generated in the
phagolysosomal structure, exert toxic effects on the
bacterial pathogens. Inducible nitric oxide synthase is an
important enzyme which enhances the antibacterial action
of macrophages. This enzyme leads to the production of
nitric oxide which, following interaction with superoxide
and thiol groups, generates a number of antimicrobial
compounds
Activation of macrophages enhances their antimicrobial
capability. Macrophage activation occurs most effectively
167
by the combination of exposure to bacterial products and
to IFN-y acting on specific macrophage receptors. In
response to IL-12,IL-15 and IL-18 produced
1bv
antigen-bearing dendritic cells, NK cells and Thl CD4
cells  secrete IFN-y which enhances
a number of
microbiocidal pathways in macrophages, including the
respiratory burst and generation of inducible nitric oxide
synthase.  During
adaptive
immune responses
intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium bovis and
Brucella abortus, the most important source of IFN-y is
THl CD4+ lymphocytes. Tissue macrophages involved in
immune responses to intracellular pathogens may undergo
terminal  differentiation into multinucleated giant cells,
often observed in tuberculous lesions. If intracellular
pathogens persist at the site of tissue invasion, recruitment
and activation of macrophages and T cells can result in the
formation of a granuloma at the site. Granulomas
associated with tuberculosis in animals are usually
composed  of a  core  of  infected  and uninfected
macrophages, epithelioid cells and multi-nucleated giant
cells with accumulations of T cells at the periphery (see
Fig 23.2).
Adaptive immune responses to bacterial infections
After uptake of bacteria by dendritic cells, peptides of
bacterial origin are presented to T cells in association with
MHC molecules on the surface of the dendritic cells.
Whether they survive
eintracellularly
extracellularly, bacteria can activate CD4+ TH cells. In
addition, some intracellular bacteria can activate CD8+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are MHC class I
restricted. Induction of MHC class II restricted T cells
168
follows contact with bacterial antigen from organisms
which were exogenous. After binding of bacteria to
specific cell  surface  receptors  on  macrophages  and
dendritic cells and engulfment following opsonization or
receptor-induced
1endocytosis, bacterial
1antigensare
degraded in endosomes and digested into peptides. The
peptides associate with MHC class II molecules before
transfer to the cell surface. Induction of MHC class
I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes follows entry of
intracellular bacteria followed by antigen processing.
Often by escaping from endosomes into the cytoplasm,
intracellular bacteria are capable of evading many steps
employed by phagocytes in the destruction of bacterial
pathogens.
.MHCclassIrestrictedcytotoxicT
lymphocytes kill host cells infected with intracellular
bacteria, whereas CD4* Th 1 cells release cytokines which
activate macrophages and promote  bacterial destruction
within these phagocytic cells. They also provide support
for antibody production by B cells. Functionally distinct
subtypes of CD4+ T cells strongly influence immune
responses through the secretion of cytokines. Subtype
CD4+ Th1 cells which secrete IFN-y and TNF-β activate
macrophages and promote destruction of engulfed bacteria.
This subtype also promotes production of opsonizing
antibody. The secretions of CD4* Th2 cells include IL-4,
IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 which support production of
particular antibody isotypes, some involved in allergic
responses. This subtype also plays a central role in the
involvement of eosinophils, basophils and mast cells in
response to invading parasites, especially helminths.
Identified by their secretion of IL-17, Thl7 cells promote
antimicrobial peptide production by epithelial  cells and
contribute to neutrophil participation in local inflammatory
169
responses. Another subtype of CD4+ T cells, referred to as
regulatory T cells (TREG), produce IL-10 and TFG-β
which suppress host immune responses, especially CD4
THl responses  when  effective  control of invading
microbial pathogens has been achieved.
Cell-mediated immunity is essential for the control of
intracellular bacterial infections but humoral immunity has
a major protective role against extracellular bacteria.
Unless a bacterial pathogen is capable of intracellular
growth and survival, antibodies offer effective protection
against many bacterial infections. Bacteria can enter the
body through ingestion, inhalation, contact, puncture
wounds   and  other  routes
(Fig. 3.14). Following
introduction into the body, attachment to host cells and
invasion of tissues may occur. Toxin-induced damage to
tissues may result in localized or systemic disease.
Bacteria with fimbrial adhesins can adhere to mucosal
epithelium or to ciliated epithelium of the upper
respiratory tract. Secretory IgA can bind to bacterial
adhesins and block bacterial attachment to mucosal
surfaces. The presence
of a capsule can prevent
phagocytosis but, when opsonized by specific antibody
and C3b, such encapsulated bacteria can be ingested and
destroyed by phagocytic
cells. Specific antibodies can exert their protective effects
against extracellular bacteria in many different ways. In
addition to preventing bacterial attachment to tissues and
opsonization of encapsulated bacteria, antibodies can
agglutinate and immobilize motile bacteria, activate
complement and neutralize bacterial toxins and enzymes
which promote their spreading in tissues (Fig. 3.14).
Susceptible bacteria with bound IgG or IgM antibody
170
molecules which activate complement can be lysed by the
membrane attack complex. Host cells which display on
their surfaces peptides derived from intracellular bacteria
can be destroyed by NK cells or macrophages in the
antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  reaction.
passively protect newbom animals against bacterial toxins
such as the neurotoxin of Clostridium tetani, which causes
tetanus. Many bacterial vaccines used in veterinary
medicine confer protection against bacterial infections by
antibodies or memory B cells. Components of innate and
adaptive immune responses which contribute to protection
against bacterial pathogens are presented in Table 3.14.

Immunity to fungi
Of the vast number of fungal species known, only
a
relatively small number produce disease in humans and
animals. Three categories of f
fungi: moulds, yeasts and
dimorphic fungi, can produce 
infections in susceptible
172
animals. Apart from the dermatophytes, pathogens that
cause ringworm in animals and humans, the majority of
fungi are saprophytes. Tissue invasion by fungi is usually
indicative
of
immunological
incompetence,
immunosuppression or, in the case of yeast infections, a
defence mechanisms offer the first and often the most
important protection against many  opportunistic fungal
invaders.  Adaptive
immune
eresponses, based
on
cell-mediated reactions to fungal agents, may strengthen
host defences especially
againstintracellular
fungal
invaders. Humoral immune responses to fungal agents are
specific  and  useful  for diagnostic  purposes.  Specific
antibodies may promote engulfment of fungal structures by
neutrophils but, on their own, offer limited protection
against invasive Aspergillus species and a number of other
opportunistic fungal invaders.
Innate immune responses to fungi
Intact skin, with its low pH and secreted fatty acids, and
mucosal surfaces with their antimicrobial secretions are
normal commensal microflora on the skin and on mucosal
surfaces is important for its inhibitory effect on yeast
proliferation in the oral cavity, along the alimentary tract
and on other mucosal surfaces. An array of antimicrobial
factors
in body
fluids,  phagocytic  cells 
 and
pathogen-recognition receptors on host cells and soluble
pathogen-recognition receptors, provide both protection
against fungal invasion and detection of their presence on
mucosal surfaces in the respiratory tract, in the alimentary
tract and in the urogenital tract.
173
Aspergillosis, which is primarily a respiratory infection,
follows inhalation of spores. Respiratory epithelial cells
are the first anatomical barrier to invasion, and mucociliary
clearance contributes
  tolocal protection. Alveolar
macrophages, which typically constitute the first line of
phagocytic defence, are joined later by blood monocytes
and neutrophils at the site of infection. Natural killer cells
contribute to innate defences as infection progresses. The
reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, present in phagocytes, is a
requirement for host defence against aspergillosis.
Activation of NADPH oxidase generates superoxide anion
fromoxygen
withthe
productionof additional
antimicrobial factors. In neutrophils, activation of NADPH
granules   and
results  in
hyphal
damage.
Neutrophil-mediated inhibition of fungal spore growth is
independent of NADPH oxidase, however, and requires
lactoferrin-mediated iron depletion (Segal, 2009)
Cell-associated and soluble pathogen-recognition receptors
which identify fungal motifs include tolllike receptors
(TLRs), dectin-1 , pentraxin-3, mannose-binding lectin and
surfactant proteins A and D. Involvement of TLRs induces
production of proinflammatory cytokines. Dectin-1 is a
receptor for β-glucans, common components of fungal cell
walls, and is expressed at high levels in the pulmonary and
gastrointestinal tracts. Dectin-1 , which recognizes β-glucan
motifs, and TLR-2, which recognizes phospholipomannan,
stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These
structures, dectin-1 and TLRs, enable host cells to
distinguish resting spores from germinating spores and
both spore types from hyphae of Aspergillus fiumigatus.
174
Fungal β-glucans trigger pro-inflammatory responses in
macrophages to germinating spores. Gliotoxin, produced
by A. fumigatus, is a potent inhibitor of macrophage
phagocytosis (Richardson, 2005).

adaptive immunity which contribute to protection against
fungal pathogens are presented in Table 3.15.
Adaptive immune responses to fungi
Activation ofpathogen-recognition
receptors induces
maturation of antigen-presenting cells which prime T cell
mediated immunity. Interactions between macrophages
and
d  lymphocytes are required  for  the control
of
intracellular fungal infections, especially for dimorphic
177
fungi. In response to fungal invasion, macrophages release
IL-12 which acts on T lymphocytes and NK cells. When
stimulated by IL-12, lymphocytes and NK cells release
IFN-y which acts on macrophages, promoting destruction
of engulfed fungal structures. In addition, IFN-y augments
TNF-α production by macrophages, which enhances
killing of fungal invaders. When dectin-1 , on the surface of
epithelial cells, binds to β-glucans on fungal structures,
activation of pathways which produce cytokines and drive
CD4+ T lymphocytes towards the TH17 phenotype result
(Holland and  Vinh,  2009).  Subsequently,  TH17
lymphocytes elaborate IL-17 and IL-22 which promote
antimicrobial  peptide  production   by   epithelial  cells.
AlthoughIL-17-producing
CD4Tcellsstimulate
production   of  specific  myelopoietic growth  factors,
cytokines and  chemokines  which  promote  neutrophil
recruitment, in some instances IL-17 can depress host
defences  in experimental models.  Regulatory  T cells
induce tolerance and decrease allergic responses to fungal
antigens.
Resistance to most fungal agents is dependent on T
cell-mediated immunity, particularly CD4+ THl cells
secreting INF-y, with the participation of dendritic cells.
Unlike THl cells, TH2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13
and, rather than promoting protection, are associated with
allergic reactions to fungal antigens. Although specific
antibodies may opsonize fungal structures in host tissues
and contribute to their clearance by neutrophils, protective
immunity is not usually associated with humoral immune
responses.
Immunity to viruses
178
Viral invasion of host cells may result in direct
interference with cellular functions and, in addition, may
induce deleterious host responses. Because of the complex
interactions between viruses and their hosts, clinical signs
of disease may not be evident and the form and severity of
disease is influenced by host susceptibility, by the
virulence of the virus and by other characteristics of the
virus including routes of transmission, tissue preferences
and dissemination within the host. The diversity evident
among viruses that affect mammalian and avian species
limits the value of direct comparison of viral pathogens.
Likewise, immune mechanisms which apply to viral agents
are usually valid only for individual virus families or for
viruses that share common biological characteristics
All viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens. Despite
their dependence on host cells for replication, viruses
display enormous diversity. They have evolved highly
sophisticated mechanisms for cellular invasion, replication
and evasion of immune responses. Innate immune
responses to viral infections include the induction of type I
interferons and activation of NK cells. Cytotoxic T cells
and neutralizing antibodies are major adaptive immune
responses  which  confer long-term protection against
individual viruses. The high mutation rate among viruses.
especially RNA viruses and retroviruses, and the ability of
viruses to evade host immunity are reasons why
long-lasting protection against reinfection is difficult to
achieve for some viruses.
Innate immunity to viral infections
179
The skin and mucous membranes offer the first line of
defence against viral invasion. If these defences are
breached, early innate immune responses begin with the
release of soluble mediators of inflammation which
include cytokines, chemokines and complement fragments.
These soluble mediators regulate cell movement and cell
recruitment to sites of inflammation, cell adhesion and cell
activation. In addition, some mediators may induce
apoptosis of infected cells. The host's immune response is
aimed at the complete elimination of the viral pathogen
and many released mediators have potent antiviral activity.
Factors that influence the outcome of a viral infection
include the immune status and age of the host, the general
health of the animal and intercurrent infections. Among the
viralfactors that influence the outcome are strain
virulence, size of infecting dose and the route of entry into
the host.

The ability of the host to detect viral invasion and to
respond rapidly to the pathogen is a requirement for the
elimination of the invading infectious agent. The innate
immune response has developed as a rapid and regulated
defence system in which the recognition of an invading
pathogen can occur by binding to a specific cytoplasmic
receptor or toll-like receptor (TLR). These TLRs recognize
conserved patterms
of
proteins,  lipoproteins,
double-stranded RNA or unmethylated DNA which are
pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These interactions
induce multiple signalling
  pathways which promote
activation of cells and secretions that contribute initially to
innate defences and later to adaptive immune responses.
Induction of innate immune responses to viral infections
results in the production of type I interferons and
activation of NK cells. The term interferon derives from
the ability of these cytokines to inhibit viral replication.
Production of type I interferons, the earliest immune
response of the host to viral infection, is followed closely
by the activation of NK cells. Type I interferons, a family
of related polypeptides, include interferon-α (IFN-α),
IFN-β, IFN-k, IFN-2, and a number of other cytokines
with similar biological activity. The typical stimulus for
type I interferon synthesis is viral infection, specifically
double-stranded RNA produced during viral replication in
an infected cell. Type II interferon, or IFN-y, is produced
following antigenic
ormitogenicstimulation
of
lymphocyte   subsets.  Interferon-α  is  produced
1by
185
leukocytes, especially macrophages, following viral
infection. In response to a viral infection, fibroblasts and
epithelial cells produce IFN-β. The induction, production
and other characteristics of IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-y are
summarized in Table 3.16.
Interferons
Type I interferons are produced by cells of the innate
immune system and also by infected cells. There are two
distinct ways whereby interferons can be produced: by
infected cells which detect components of virus replication
within them, and by cells of the innate immune system
which detect the presence of virus through toll-like
receptors.   Pathogen-derived  nucleic  acids  can 
be
intracellularly. These receptors can detect virions after
engulfment
by   phagocytosis   or 
pinocytosis.
Patterm-recognition receptors involved in the detection of
viral
1 pathogens include TLR-3, TLR-7 and TLR-9.
Immature dendritic cells, tissue macrophages and
plasmacytoid dendritic cells express one or more of these
signals from toll-like receptors. Plasmacytoid dendritic
cells are especially important in the production of type I
interferons.
Within hours of viral infection, IFN-α and IFN-β are
produced by infected host cells or by sentinel cells of the
innate immune system. In acute systemic viral infection,
interferon levels approximate virus titre as virus replication
proceeds (Fig. 3.16). Interferons bind to the interferon
receptor on adjacent host cells and induce production of
186
antiviral protein, enabling them to resist infection
Interferons do not directly block viral replication but
activate genes with direct antiviral activity.  Type I
interferons, bound to the interferon receptor on a cell,
      
synthesis and degradation of mRNA. Three important
mechanisms relating to interference with viral replication
involve  synthesis  of double-stranded  RNA-dependent
protein kinase, activation of latent cellular endonuclease
and production of Mx proteins.
Protein kinase R (PKR) is expressed at low levels in many
cell types but, after induction by interferon-receptor
signalling, sufficiently high levels to interfere with virus
replication are produced. The main target of PKR is the
translation initiation factor elF2o which it inactivates
through phosphorylation. As PKR inhibits all protein
synthesis, both cellular and viral, it prevents virus
replication and may also result in cell death. Interferon
receptor
signalling
induces
expression
of
2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetases which, after recognition of
double-stranded RNA,  activate
a
latent cellular
ribonuclease, RNase L, which degrades mRNA and also
ribosomal RNA, thereby suppressing viral infection. The
third antiviral mechanism induced by type I interferons
involves Mx proteins which inhibit viral transcription of a
range of RNA viruses and also interfere with virus
assembly.

NK cells
Within days of a viral infection, activated NK cells are
present in the tissues. By killing host cells expressing viral
antigen on their surfaces, NK cells contribute to the
elimination of cellular reservoirs of infection. The abilitv
of NK cells to protect host cells against infection is
enhanced by cytokines secreted by macrophages and
dendritic cells. These include type I interferons, IL-12,
IL-15 and IL-18. Binding of IFN-α and IFN-β to NK cells
enhances the lytic activity of these cells and other
188
cytokines produced by dendritic cells, and macrophages
promote the antiviral activity of NK cells. Some viruses
block MHC class I expression when they infect host cells,
thereby  preventing  presentation  of  viral  antigen  in
association with MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T
ymphocytes. In the absence of MHC class I molecules.
NK cells recognize and destroy such cells because the
absence of MHC class I molecules releases NK cells from
a normal state of inhibition.
By responding at an early stage to viral infection, NK cells
contribute to host protection before adaptive immune
responses have developed. Direct cytolysis through a
perforin/granzyme mechanism, production of IFN-y which
protects cells  from  viral
1  infection    and  activates
macrophage antiviral activity, and destruction of infected
cells
through
 antibody-dependent   cellmediated
cytotoxicity are the major contributions of NK cells to
antiviral immunity.
Macrophages  contribute  to  antiviral  immunity  through
phagocytosis of viruses and virus-infected cells, sometimes
with  the involvement of  specific antibodies and
complement.   These   phagocytic    cells  can  destroy
virus-infected cells and produce antiviral molecules such
as IFN-α and tumour necrosis factor-α.
Adaptive immune responses to viral infections
Innate immune responses to viral invasion are succeeded
by   specific  adaptive   immune    responses.   Adaptive
immunity is mediated by antibodies which block virus
binding and entry into host cells and by cytotoxic T
189
lymphocytes which can eliminate infection by killing
virus-infected cells.
Humoral immunity
Antibody-mediated immunity is effective against viruses
only at the extracellular stage of infection, before they
enter host cells. In the case of cytopathic viruses which are
released following destruction of
host cells, antibodies play an important protective role
also. In many instances, immunity against re-infection is
mediated by  circulating  virus-neutralizing antibodies.
Antiviral   antibodies
function mainly as neutralizing
antibodies which prevent virus attachment and entry into
host cells. These antibodies bind to the viral envelope,
capsid antigens or other surface antigenic components.
Secreted antibodies of the IgA isotype prevent attachment
of viruses to host cells on mucosal surfaces. Antibodies
produced by the dam and secreted in colostrum passively
protect newborn animals against many viral pathogens.
Specific antibodies can prevent attachment of viruses to
host T cell receptors, thereby preventing entry into the cell.
They can also promote clearance of virus particles from
the circulation by clumping viruses and facilitating their
removal by phagocytic cells. Lysis of some enveloped
viruses by the membrane attack complex can occur when
IgG or IgM antibodies bind to surface viral antigens and
activate complement.  When viruses  are coated by
antibody, with C3b bound to the fixed antibody, they
become opsonized virus particles, easily engulfed and
destroyed by  phagocytic cells.  Infected  host cells
displaying viral antigen on their surfaces can be lysed by
activation of the complement sequence through the
190
involvement of bound antibody. Virus-infected cells, when
coated with antibody and with C3b bound to their surfaces,
may be engulfed and destroyed by phagocytes. Antibody
bound to virus-infected host cells can initiate their
destruction   by   NK   cells   in    antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Despite the diverse activities of
antibodies in antiviral immunity, they are only effective
against extracellular viral
1pathogens.Eliminationof
viruses within host cells requires the participation of NK
cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes which can kill such
virus-infected cells
Cell-mediated immunity
Although antibodies have an important role in the
clearance of viruses from the circulation, preventing
viraemia and spreading to target tissues at the acute phases
of infection, they cannot eliminate intracellular infection.
The principal T cell surveillance system which operates
against viruses is selective and highly efficient and results
in the destruction of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T
lymphocytes. In the course of a viral infection, CD8+ T
cells undergo rapid proliferation, reaching their peak at
about 10 days before declining slowly (Fig. 3.16)
differentiation into effector cytotoxic CD8+ T cells which
release cytokines, particularly IFN- and tumour necrosis
factor, and kill infected cells directly through the release of
perforin and granzymes or through the induction of
apoptosis by Fas/Fas ligand interactions. Interferon-y and
tumour necrosis factor not only promote recruitment of
inflammatory cells to the site of viral infection but also
interfere with virus replication. A small proportion of the
191
CD8+ T cells which derived from the clonally expanded
population of T cells, with distinct survival receptors
persist as memory cells. These memory cells, which
received appropriate support from CD4+ T cells during the
initial activation, may survive for many years.
Most virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are CD8+ T
cells which recognize viral antigen displayed in association
S        
Differentiation of CD8t cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires
cytokines produced   by  CD4+ T  helper cells or
co-stimulators from infected cells. The principal antiviral
activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes is associated with their
destruction of infected cells but other antiviral functions
relate to activation of nucleases in infected cells which can
degrade viral nucleic acid and production of IFN-y which
exerts some antiviral activity.
Destruction of virus-infected cells can occur through direct
cellular interactions involving cytotoxic T lymphocytes
and NK cells, through cytokine release and through
granule exocytosis. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes can signal to
target cells using Fas, a member of the TNF receptor
family expressed on many cell types. When Fas ligand,
expressed on activated T cells, binds to Fas, it initiates a
signalling cascade which leads to apoptotic cell death
Although NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize
mechanisms for the destruction of target cells. Specialized
cytotoxic   components   released   from  cytotoxic
lymphocytes can kill target cells by damaging their cell
membranes. These cytotoxic components, perforin and
192
granzymes, are present in cytoplasmic granules termed
lytic granules. When a target cell is recognized, the
granules relocate to the site of contact between the
cytotoxic T cell and the target cell and release the
pore-forming  protein,
perforin,
together
granule-associated enzymes referred to as granzymes.
Within the lytic cytoplasmic granules, perforin molecules
are   inactive
monomers.
When
released into  the
extracellular space, where they encounter increased
calcium levels, they undergo polymerization enabling them
to form pores in the target cell membrane. Structurally and
functionally, perforin shares common features with the
complement component C9
Granzymes, proteases which are contained in the lytic
granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are released on
activation of these cells. These enzymes are serine
proteases which apparently require the pore-forming action
of perforin to enter the target cell in association with other
small molecules and calcium ions. On entering the target
cell, granzymes induce a series of changes in the
cytoplasm which lead to the rapid initiation of apoptosis
through   activation 
of caspases, induction of DNA
fragmentation  and
1   interference with  cellular repair
mechanisms.  Granzyme

The mode of action of granzyme C is not clearly defined
caspase-independent pathway. Although many steps in the
193
elucidated, it is evident that the contents of lytic granules.
when released, lead to rapid apoptosis in target cells.
Neither NK cells nor cytotoxic T lymphocytes are
damaged by the contents of their lytic granules. Both
perforin and granzymes are synthesized as inactive
molecules. Activation of perforin and granzymes occurs
after their release from the lytic granules. High levels of
calcium ions and other microenvironmental changes are
required for their activation. As an additional safeguard, it
is reported that cathepsin B, which lines the granule
membranes, cleaves perforin on the cytotoxic 
lymphocyte side of the contact point with the target cell.
Viruses which cause systemic infections in animals can be
transmitted by many different routes. Common routes of
transmission include the respiratory and alimentary tracts.
Anatomical barriers, antiviral  cytokines and phagocytic
cells contribute to innate defences against viral invasion
(Fig. 3.17). Adaptive immune responses, which develop
more slowly than innate responses, are mediated by
specific antibodies which neutralize circulating viruses and
by cytotoxic T lymphocytes which destroy virus-infected
cells. Components of innate and adaptive immunity that
contribute  to protection   against viral  infections  are
presented in Table 3.17.
Concluding comments
In an environment in which opportunistic infectious agents
and pathogenic microorganisms are ubiquitous, protection
against infection is a requirement for survival. The
cooperative interactions of components of innate and
194
adaptive immunity provide an effective defence against
many pathogenic microorganisms. With its capacity to
respond to a vast array of antigenic determinants on
infectious agents, the immune system can respond to tissue
invasion    with   effective   humoral
1  and    cell-mediated
responses. Characteristics of some infectious agents such
as RNA viruses and retroviruses, with high mutation rates,
can limit the effectiveness of immune responses, and
long-lasting protection against some of these pathogens is
difficult to achieve.

Immunodeficiency diseases
In mammals andalso in avian species, resistance to
infection is a fundamental requirement for survival. Like
other complex systems, the immune system is subject to
failures in some or all ofits components and these failures
can have serious consequences for the host. Defects in one
or more components of the immune system can result in
increased  susceptibility  to  opportunistic  infection  by
microorganisms of environmental origin. If the defect
affects components of the immune system essential for the
development
t of
protective
immunity, overwhelming
infection is the inevitable outcome. Immunodeficiency
diseases therefore result from the absence or failure of one
or more elements of the immune system. Primary
immunodeficiency diseases are due
 togenetic
or
developmental defects in the immune system. Although
these defects are present at birth, they may not become
evident
until later in life. Secondary or acquired
immunodeficiency is the loss ofimmune competence and
develops as a consequence of exposure of cells of the
immune system to infectious agents, treatment with
immunosuppressive drugs, neoplasia or malnutrition. The
human
population
1S
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome or AIDS. This syndrome results mainly from
infection with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)
which is a double-stranded RNA retrovirus which infects
CD4 + T lymphocytes. Severe depletion of CD4 +T cells
results in drastic functional impairment of cell-mediated
202
immunity and death from opportunistic infections. Since
its discovery in 1981, AIDs has increased to epidemic
proportions worldwide and it is estimated that more than
40 million people are infected with HIV-1 and that more
than 25 million people have died from AIDS
As a consequence ofimmunodeficiency diseases, there is a
marked increase in susceptibility to bacterial, fungal, viral
and protozoal infections. The nature of the infection in a
       
component of the immune system that is defective. A
defect in humoral immunity usually results in increased
susceptibility to infections with pyogenic bacteria. When
cell-mediated immunity is defective, there is an increased
susceptibility to viruses and other intracellular pathogens
Combined deficiencies of both humoral and cell-mediated
immunity result in an increased susceptibility to all types
of
 pathogenic    microorganisms.
In
humans
with
immu-nodeficiencies involving
T cells, an increased
incidence of neoplastic diseases caused by oncogenic
viruses is reported. In addition, certain immunodeficiency
diseases are associated with an increased incidence of
autoimmunity which may be related to a deficiency of
regulatory T cells which maintain self tolerance. Because
maturation or activation, or from defects involving
componentsofinnate
immunity, 
immunodeficiency
diseases are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous.
Sequential stages in the development of the immune
system leading  to immunological
1  competence and
deficiencies which interrupt its development leading to
immunodeficiency are shown in Fig. 4.1. Causes of
primary
immunodeficiency
and
secondary
203
immunodeficiency and the components of the immune
system affectedare presented in Fig. 4.2. More than 200
primary immunodeficiency diseases have been reported in
the human population and the genetic basis for more than
half of these has been determined. Primary and secondary
immunodeficiency  diseases  are being recognized  with
increasing frequency in domestic animals, especially in
dogs and horses. The history, clinical signs and laboratory
reports may suggest defects in the animal's immune
system in some instances. Primary immunodeficiencies
relating to T and B lymphocytes can be identified by
combining clinical, laboratory and post-mortem data (Fig
4.3). A history ofinfectious diseases during the first weeks
oflife, increased susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens
and recurring or continuous infections unresponsive to
treatment is consistent with an immunodeficiency disease
The blood picture may reveal low numbers of white blood
cells, either as lymphopenia or neutropenia. Changes in the
concentrations or ratios ofimmunoglobulins andalteration
in serum complement concentration are further evidence of
defects in the functioning of the immune system. When
compared with the human population, a relatively small
number ofimmunodeficiency diseases are described in
domestic animals. It is probable, however, that when
recurring diseases in animals are subjected to closer
scrutiny, many of these will be found to have an
immunological basis related to defects in the development
or functioning of the immune system.

Deficiencies in innate immunity in humans andanimals
relating to problems in the development or functioning of
phagocytic cells and in the complement system are
summarized in Table 4.1 and illustrated in Fig. 4.4.
Severe combined immunodeficiency diseases
The heterogeneous group of diseases known as severe
in lymphoid development that affect T cells either alone or
in combination with
B cells and NK cells. Severe
combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) is often due
to developmental defects at the level of the lymphoid stem
cell in the bone marrow. Other causes of SCID include
adenosine  deaminase
 deficiency, purine nucleoside
phosphorylase deficiency and defects in the recombinase
activating genes, RAG1 or RAG2
205
Defects that occur early in embryological development can
have a profound effect on the entire immune system. A
severe form of SCID that occurs in humans, reticular
dysgenesis, results from developmental problems at the
level of the haematopoietic multipotent stem cell in the
bone marrow. This condition, which has an autosomal
recessive mode ofinheritance, leads to developmental
failure of B cells, T cells and granulocytes (Fig. 4.4). The
resulting general failure ofimmunity leads to infection by a
variety of microorganisms and early death of affected
babies.
If lymphoid stem cells, which develop from multipotential
stem cells in the bone marrow, do not populate the thymus
by the sixth week of gestation in the human embryo, the
thymus does not become a lymphoid organ. Up to 50% of
SCID cases are X-linked due to mutations in the gene
encoding the Yc chain of the IL-2 receptor. This Yc chain
also forms part of the receptors for the cytokines IL-4,
IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. Thus, this mutation impairs
responses to a range of cytokines, leading to defective T
cellmaturation. Of
particular
importance in the
development of this disease is IL-7 whose receptor
requires the Yc chain for signalling. The inability of IL-7 to
stimulate growth of thymocytes results in impaired
maturation of T cells. Similarly, the receptor for IL-15.
        
IL-15 to exert its strong influence on NK cell development
accounts for the deficiency of NK cells. Accordingly, in
X-linked SCID, there is impaired maturation of T cells and
of NK cells and greatly reduced numbers of mature T cells
and NK cells; the number of B cells is usually normal or
increased. A small number of patients with T cell
206
lymphopenia and normal B cell numbers show an
autosomal recessive rather than an X-linked pattern of
inheritance and are similar phenotypically to patients with
X-linked SCID. Cytokine transduction of signals, which
elicit specific responses in target cells, involves enzymes
called Janus kinases (JAKs), transcription factors called
signal transducers andactivators of transcription. Patients
with autosomal recessive SCID have mutations in the
genes for the IL-7 and chain receptor. The α chain, which
associates with the Yc chain, is required for the intracellular
signalling by the protein JAK3 kinase. An autosomal
recessive form of SCID results from a mutation in the
genes  that encode
 fore
enzymes involvedin the
rearrangement of the immunoglobulin genes of pre - B
cells and the T cell receptor genes of pre-T cells. These
recombinase activating genes termed RAGl and RAG2 are
essential for rearrangement, and consequently mutations in
either gene result in an absence of T cells and B cells;
however, NK cells are not affected.

disease. Prolonged recurring bacterial
infections during infancy are a feature of
this disease. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency
has been reported in HolsteinFriesian cattle
and in Irish Setters. Clinically, this
deficiency in animals is characterized by
recurring bacterial infections. At
post-mortem examination there are large
numbers ofintravascular neutrophils which
have not migrated into the tissues. In LAD
type 2, neutrophils lack sialyl Lewis X, the
carbohydrate ligand required for binding to
E-selectin and P-selectin on
cytokine-activated endothelium. This
autosomal recessive condition results in
poor random mobility and weak
chemotactic responses by neutrophils.
Because neutrophils fail to adhere to
vascular endothelium and lack rolling
adhesion, pus formation is not a feature of
pyogenic bacterial infections in affected
children. The disease is characterized by
recurring bacterial infections.

the defects in the oxidative pathway
whereby phagocytes generate hydrogen
peroxide and the resulting reactive products
such as hypochlorous acid, which kill
engulfed bacteria, patients with this disease
are susceptible to bacterial and fungal
infections. The inability of neutrophils and
sometimes, of macrophages to generate
reactive oxygen intermediates such as
superoxide anions results in failure to kill
engulfed microorganisms. The most
intracellular
bacterial and
common form of chronic granulomatous
disease is due to mutation of a gene on the
fungal infections
X chromosome coding for cytochrome b.
As a consequence of the persistent
infections, chronic cell-mediated immune
responses develop involving T
cell-mediated macrophage activation and
the formation of granulomas, hence the
name of this disease. This inherited disease
is manifested by the development of serious
infections in early childhood. A similar
disease inherited in an X-linked manner has
been reported in Irish Setters.

The proteolytic activity of Clr and Cls is
inhibited by a plasma protein called C1
inhibitor. In humans, an autosomal
dominantinherited disease called
hereditary angioneurotic oedema is due to a
deficiency of C1 inhibitor. Patients with
this deficiency have episodes of
circumscribed oedema which may affect
different parts of the body. If oedema
affects the upper respiratory tract it may
cause a potentially life-threatening airway
obstruction. Other deficiencies of
complement regulation reported in humans
include factors I and H. Complement
deficiencies have been observed in both
domestic and laboratory animals, especially
in inbred lines. Brittany spaniels with a
congenital deficiency of C3 and rabbits
with a C6 deficiency have been reported.
Recurring infections with pyogenic bacteria
are a feature of complement deficiencies in
animals, especially with C3 deficiency,
confirming the importance of C3 in the
opsonization of pyogenic bacteria. A
deficiency of factor H, which inactivates
C3b in the alternative pathway, has been
described in Yorkshire pigs.

Immunodeficiency diseases that affect horses include
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in Arabian
horses, agammaglobulinaemia in male foals, common
variable immunodeficiency affecting adult horses, IgM
deficiency in foals, and failure of foals to ingest or absorb
colostral antibodies either due to failure of the mare to
produce adequate amounts of colostrum or to a lack of
appropriate management  of the neonatal foal. Severe
combined
1immunodeficiency is  the  most important
congenital  immunodeficiency recognized in  Arabian  or
Arabian-crossbreed horses. The condition is inheritedas an
autosomal recessive defect. Affected foals fail to produce
functional B or T lymphocytes, and few circulating
lymphocytes are present in their blood. Neutrophil and
monocyte function is usually normal. Precolostral serum
samples have no detectable IgM. Maternal antibodies.
acquired through ingestion of colostrum, usually confer
passive protection
for upto3months.Oncethese
passively transferred immunoglobulins are catabolized,
affected foals become agammaglobulinaemic; most die
before 6 months of age from recurring infections caused by
opportunistic
pathogens.Adenoviral
pneumonia
1S
reported to be one of the most common causes of death.
Enteritis, hepatitis or infections in other organs sometimes
occur in affected foals without pulmonary involvement.
On post-mortem examination, apart from evidence of
bacterial and viral infection, there is marked hypoplasia of
both primary and secondary lymphoid tissue. The spleens
of affected foals lack lymphoid follicles and germinal
centres, lymph nodes lack germinal centres and cellular
depletion is evident in their paracortical regions. Thymus
development is so limited that thymic tissue may be
difficult to find in affectedanimals. The disease is due to a
217
mutation in the gene located on chromosome 9, coding for
the catalytic subunit of a DNA-dependent protein kinase.
Deficiency of the protein kinase results in failure of the
variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain on B
cells and of the variable region of the T cell receptor. As
severe combined immunodeficiency disease is inherited in
an autosomal recessive manner, its occurrence indicates
that both parents carry the mutation and this can be
confirmed by DNA analysis. PCR tests can be used to
detect animals that are heterozygous or homozygous
(affected foals) for the mutated gene. Genetic analysis has
shown that more than 8% of Arabian horses carry the gene.
Severe combined immunodeficiency disease has been
described in different breeds of dogs. An X - linked SCID
in Basset hounds is characterized by lymphope-nia, with
increased  numbers of  B lymphocytes and few  T
lymphocytes.  Affected pups usually  remain  clinically
normal until maternally-derivedantibody levels begin to
decline between 8 and 12 weeks of age. As passive
immunity of maternal origin wanes, recurring bacterial and
viral infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts
occur. Few affected pups survive past 4 months of age
Death results from septicaemia and systemic  viral
infections. Apart from evidence of systemic infection at
post-mortem examination, there is marked hypoplasia of
primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Lymph nodes,

undetectable. The defect is due to mutations in the gene
encoding the common gamma chain ( Yc) shared by the
receptors for the interleukins IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and
IL-15. Because of their inability to express functional IL-2
receptors,  T lymphocytes  do  not
tmatureandB
218
lymphocytes   respond  to   T-lymphocyte-independent
antigens only, with no class switching from IgM to IgG. A
SCID has been described in the Welsh Corgi breedand in
Jack Russell terriers; sporadic cases of SCID have been
reported in Rottweiler, Toy Poodle and some mixed-breed
pups.
An autosomal recessive mutation which arose in the
CB-17 inbred strain of mice resulted in severe combined
immunodeficiency. In homozygous mice with this defect,
referred to as SCID mice, mature B and T lymphocytes are
absent. Affected mice have no serum immunoglobulins,
are unable to produce cell-mediated immune responses
andare highly susceptible to opportunistic infections. The
defects in SCID mice result from an inability to express
antigen-specific receptors on their lymphocytes due to
defects in DNA recombinase activating genes required for
rearrangement of T cell receptors and immunoglobulin
gene rearrangement. In this condition, development of B
cells
 ceases  before
eexpress1on
 of  cytoplasmic  or
cell-membrane
immunoglobulins. Likewise,  Tcell
development   is  arrestedat an  early  stage  before
antigen-specific receptors are expressed. Blood cells other
than lymphocytes develop normally in these mice; red
blood cells, monocytes and neutrophils are present and
function in a normal manner.
Thymic aplasia or hypoplasia
During early embryological development, cells derived
from the bone marrow migrate to the epithelial thymus
which develops from the third pharyngeal pouches with a
contribution from  the  fourth
pharyn-geal
 pouches.
219
Responding to inductive factors from the thymic epithelial
reticular cells, these pro-thymocytes become competent T
lymphocytes.
On
 leaving
the thymus,  mature
lymphocytes seed other lymphoid organs with subsets
which are responsible for cell-mediated immune responses.
Accordingly thymic aplasia has a profound influence on T
cell function: all populations of T cells including helper,
cytotoxic and
regulatory
cells
are affected.

An important animal model of T cell immunodeficiency
resulting from abnormal thymic development is the nude

designated nu, which is controlled by a recessive gene on
chromosome 11, are hairless and have rudimentary thymic
glands. They have  defective cell-mediated

antigens. These mice, however, do have low numbers of

domestic animals; inbred lines of dogs and cattle with
absent or small  thymic glands have been reported.
Affectedanimals have defective cell-mediated immune
responses.
Wiskott-Aldrich s yndrome
An  uncommon  X-linked  immunodeficiency   condition,
characterized
1bythrombocytopenia,eczema
1 and
immunodeficiency, is referred to as the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome (WAS). Affected patients have low numbers of
abnormal platelets, decreased IgM levels and defective T
cell function. They are prone to infections with
encapsulated bacteria and with viruses, probably because
of the gradual loss of T cells. The genetic basis of the
disease is a mutation in the X - linked gene coding for the
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) which is
224
expressed by haematopoietic stem cells and is probably
important in the regulation of lymphocyte and platelet
development and function. In T lymphocytes, WASP is
involved in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton
when these cells are activated following antigen
recognition.
.When
examined
by
 scanning electron
microscopy, T lymphocytes from patients with this
syndrome have an abnormal appearance; they also have
fewer microvilli on their cell surfaces than normal T cells
During antibody production, there is close interaction
betweenTlymphocytes and B lymphocytes as the
cytoskeleton of the T cell reorientates itself towards the B
cell. This close cooperation fails to occur in WAS and
consequently T-lymphocyte support for B lymphocytes is
lacking and B cells are unable to respond to polysaccharide
antigens. Low IgM levels are another feature of this
syndrome. With increasing age, affected patients have
reduced numbers of lymphocytes and develop a more
severe form ofimmunodeficiency. It is probable that
WASP defects interfere with the complex processes
involved in the activation and migration of lymphocytes
andalso with lymphocyte survival.
Primary
immunodeficiency
diseases
involving
B
lymphocytes
When a B cell defect occurs in humans with early failure
in B lymphocyte development, it results in a complete
absence of mature
eB cells and,  accordingly, no
immunoglobulin  production.  As maternal  IgG  levels
decline,
 this  autosomal 
recessive
form
agam-maglobulinaemia results in widespread infections in
affected babies. A number of autosomal recessive
225
agammaglobulinaemic conditions relate to mutations in the
μ heavy chain gene and to defects in the expression of the
pre-B cell receptor which prevent normal B cell
development.
Agammaglobulinaemia, which is inherited in an X-linked
manner in humans, is characterized
by   an   absence
ofimmunoglobulins in the serum,
and
 is   called
X-linkedagammaglobulinaemia
or
Bruton-type
agammaglobulinaemia. The condition usually becomes
evident clinically before 6 months of age with the decline
in maternally-derived IgG acquired transplacentally. The
agammaglobulinaemia is accompanied by serious and
repeated pyogenic bacterial infections. The defect in
X-linkedagammaglobulinae-mia is a failure of pre-B cells
in the bone marrow to develop into mature B cells. This
failure is caused by mutations or deletions of the Bruton
tyrosine kinase gene. Bruton tyrosine kinase is involved in
transducing signals from the pre-B cell receptors which are
required for the continued maturation of these cells, and,
because of this defect, B cell differentiation is
blockedat   the
pre-B
cell
level.
Patients  with
X-linkedagammaglobulinaemia
ausuallyhave lowor
undetectableimmunoglobulin levels, few or no B cells in
theirblood or lymphoid tissue, no germinal centres
inlymph nodes and no plasma cells in tissues. The bone
marrow of male patients with this deficiency disease
usually contains normal numbers of pre-B cells. In contrast
to B cell development, T cell maturation, numbers and
functions are usually normal. An inbred mouse strain
called CBA/N has an X-linked defect in B cell
development which is a consequence of a point mutation in
the tyrosine kinase gene.
226
An unusual B cell immunodeficiency, characterized by
defective immunoglobulin class switching, results in
normal or elevated levels of serum IgM with low levels of
IgG, IgA and IgE. This condition is termed the hyper-IgM
syndrome. There are both X - linkedandautosomal
recessive forms of this syndrome, and some affected
patients are susceptible to opportunistic infections. The
X-linked condition is caused by mutation of the gene
encoding the CD4o ligand protein which is expressed on
the surface of activated T cells. Through the interaction of
the CD40 ligand with the CD40 molecule on the B cell
surface, this effector CD40 molecule transmits essential
signals for inducing immunoglobulin class switching. The
mutant forms of the CD4o ligand produced in patients with
signals through the CD40 molecule and, therefore, do not
stimulate B cells toundergo
0 heavy  chain  isotype
switching, a step which requires the involvement of T
cells.
A number ofimmunodeficiency states characterized by low
or no production of particular immunoglobulin isotypes
have been reported in humans. Of these, selective IgA
deficiency is the most common. The defect in IgA
deficiency results
from 
failureof the terminal
differentiation of B cells. As a consequence of this defect,
normal differentiation to the plasma cell stage does not
occur.
 The  clinical
 features
 ofindividuals  with
immunoglobulin isotype deficiency range from recurring
bacterial infections to an absence of clinical problems. The
numbers and functional responses of T cells in patients
with selective immunoglobulinisotype deficiencies are
usually normal.
227
An immunodeficiency condition in humans which is
characterized
1 by
decreased
1concentrations of all
immunoglobulin isotypes and occurs in the second or third
decade oflife
1S
referred
1 toascommonvariable
immunodeficiency. In addition to reduced levels of serum
immunoglobulins,
impairedantibody
responses to
infectious agents or  vaccines and increased incidence
ofinfection occur in patients with this condition. Male and
female members of the human population are affected
equally. The underlying cause of common variable
immunodeficiency is not known but the fact that mature B
lymphocytes are present in patients suggests a defect in the
differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. Although the
exact pattern ofinheritance is unknown, common variable
immunodeficiency has
 agenetic  component and  is
considered to be a primary immunodeficiency disease.
[n addition to SClD in Arabian horses and failure of foals
to ingest or absorb colostral antibodies, there are a number
ofimmunodeficiency states in foals and horses which affect
immunoglobulin
synthesis.  These
include
common
deficiency,  Fell
pony
syndrome and
　transient
hypogammaglobulinaemia.
Common
variable
immunodeficiency, which
 occurs in adult horses, is
attributed to an intrinsic inability of B lymphocytes to
synthesize immunoglobulins. Serum levels of IgG, IgM
and IgA are low or undetectable and few or no B cells are
present in the circulation or in lymphoid tissues. Chronic
or recurring infections, often caused by opportunistic
pathogens and unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy, are
commonly encountered in male or female horses with
common variable immunodeficiency. Different forms of
228
IgM deficiency have been described in horses. In foals.
low or undetectable levels of IgM occur after maternal
immunoglobulin levels decline, and respiratory or enteric
infections may prove fatal before they reach 10 months of
age. Occasionally, selective IgM deficiency occurs in adult
horses. Agammaglobulinaemia is characterized by low or
undetectable levels of all immunoglobulin classes in serum
andan absence of B lymphocytes from the circulation. The
disease, which has been described in male Thoroughbred
foals and in other breeds of horses, is considered to be an
X-linked
inherited
disease
similar
to
X-linkedagam-maglobulinaemia in humans. Affected foals
develop chronic bacterial infections as passive colostral
protection   declines.
A
condition inFell
ponies
characterized
by
immunodeficiency,
 anaemia,
lymphopenia and low IgM levels is presumed to be due to
an inherited defect. Clinical findings in affected foals,
which include opportunistic infections resulting
1n
pneumonia  and
ldiarrhoea, are consistent with
 an
immunodeficient  state.  Circulating  T  lymphocytes  in
affectedanimals are reported to be in the normal range but
B lymphocyte numbers are low.
Deficiency in the synthesis of IgG has been described in
some breeds of cattle but the clinical consequences are not
well defined. An IgA deficiency has been reported in dogs
belonging to the Beagle, German Shepherd, Irish Setter
and Shar-Pei breeds. In some affected dogs an increased
frequency of allergies has been reported. Transient
hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in foals and
pups. Clinical signs of the condition coincide with the
waning of maternal
229
antibodies acquired through colostrum, often presenting as
takes place over a period of months associated with the
production ofimmunoglobulins. A defect in lymphocyte
maturation, recorded in European breeds of cattle, is
inheritedas an autosomal recessive condition. Calves are
normal at birth but signs of hair loss, parakeratosis and
poor growth rate are evident by 2 months of age. A
decrease in lymphocyte numbers and function is evident
andantibody responses are reduced. In addition to skin
lesions, post-mortem findings include atrophy of the
thymus, lymph nodes and spleen. Affected calves show a
positive response to oral treatment with zinc, and it has
been suggested that in this hereditary condition there is an
excessive requirement for zinc and that thymic hypoplasia
results from insufficient dietary zinc
Secondary immunodeficiency
Acquired or  secondary immunodeficiency results from
atrophy  oflymphoid  tissue  or  depletion  oflymphocyte
subsets caused by infectious agents, especially viruses, by
treatment with cytotoxic drugs used for chemotherapeutic
intervention in malignancy, and from a variety of negative
influences including toxic plants, environmental pollutants
and exposure to ionizing radiation. In the human
population, infection with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) has continued to spread with an estimated 45
million people infected worldwide. In addition to infection
with HIV, human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 and measles
virus induce marked suppression of cellular immune
responses leading to secondary bacterial and fungal
infections. Because HIV and human T cell lymphotropic
230
virus 1 are retroviruses and become integrated via a
provirus into the human genome, they can persist and
potentially cause life-long damage to cells of the immune
system. Associated with HIV infection, there is a
progressive loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes, coinciding with
the failure of the infected person to control a variety
ofinfections with opportunistic pathogens. Measles-related
illness is a major cause of mortality in children in
developing countries. However, although measles virus
initially induces suppression of cellular immune responses,
the host's immunosuppression lasts for a limited period of
time and there is a progressive clearance of virus from the
tissues.
Atrophy  oflymphoid tissue or diminished  immune
responsiveness is a feature ofinfection with particular viral
agents in dogs, cats, cattle, horses, pigs, monkeys and
poultry. In addition to infectious agents, many drugs,
chemicals and other environmental factors can directly or
indirectly contribute to the occurrence and severity of
secondary immunodeficiency (Fig. 4.2). Suppression of the
functioning oflymphatic tissue or other components of the
immune system has been related to equine herpesvirus
infection of foals, bovine viral diarrhoea virus infection of
cattle and classical and African swine fever infection of
pigs.   Canine  distemper  virus 
 replication produces
lymphocytolysis and leukopenia resulting  in marked
the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii and  to
secondary bacterial infections. Parvoviral infection of dogs
destruction oflymphoid tissues along the alimentary tract.
Feline leukaemia virus infection is associated with severe
231
immunosuppression  in  some
animals,  resulting  in
opportunistic infections. As a consequence ofinfection
with  the  parvovirus
of
cats
whichcauses feline
pan-leukopenia,there
1S
extensive
damage
to
lymphopoietic cells and to myeloid cells in the bone
marrow and to lymphoid organs. Destruction of these
target tissues results
in panleukopenia and marked
immunosuppression. The lentivirus which causes feline
immunodeficiency
y replicates  principally  in  CD4+
lymphocytes. There
is aprogressive deteriorationin
cell-mediated  immunity
1associated withlymphocyte
depletion. Cats with acquired immunodeficiency induced
by this len-tivirus
develop
0leukopenia, anaemia and
chronic respiratory, enteric and skin infections. Infection
of young chickens with virulent serotypes ofinfectious
bursal disease virus causes marked immunosuppression.
When infection spreads to the bursa of Fabricius, depletion
of B lymphocytes occurs with impaired immune responses,
lowered resistance to infectious agents and ineffective
responses to vaccines.
A number of drugs administered to animals to suppress
inflammatory
 responses
or
for
the treatment
t of
autoimmune diseases have immunomodulatory activity.
Corticosteroids are potent immune modulators and some
steroids induce lymphocytopenia with depletion of CD4*
       
neutrophilia, a consequence of release of mature
neutrophils from the bone marrow anda decrease in cells
leaving the circulation. Steroids also have an inhibitory
effect on cytokine synthesis.
Cytotoxic drugs used for
treating
 animals
with
malignancy
induce
immunosuppression. Because antineoplastic agents act
232
primarily on rapidly dividing and growing cells, they affect
many cells involved in immune responses, particularly
lymphocytes and neutrophils. Methotrexate, a structural
analogueoffolic
Cacid,  blocks  folic-acid-dependent
with this compound depresses immunoglobulin synthesis
and inhibits polymorphonuclear cell involvement
in inflammatory responses. By cross-linking DNA strands,
cyclophosphamide exerts toxic effects on the bone marrow
and induces leukopenia. The activity of both T cells and B
cells is adversely affectedand, consequently, cell-mediated
immunity   andantibody  production  are  suppressed.  In
addition  to
the
immunosuppressive  effects  of
antineoplastic agents, immunosuppression is attributed to
the activity
of
 environmental 
pollutantssuch
as
polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals
A relationship between nutrition and resistance to infection
has  been  Suggested  by  clinical  observations  and  by
epidemiological data. Nutritional deficiencies have been
associated with impaired responses affecting cell-mediated
immunity, phagocytic function and complement levels.
The influence of nutritional defi-ciencies on immune
processes has been attributed to the requirement for
particular trace elements and vitamins for the optimal
functioning oflymphoid organs, especially the thymus, for
lymphocyte and neutrophil maturation, and for the
synthesis ofimmunoglobulins. Nutrients that have been
reported to enhance resistance to infectious agents include
vitamins A, C and E, zinc, manganese, copper and
selenium. Due to the complexity of host-pathogen
interactions, however, a correlation between the inclusion
of particular nutritional factors in the diet and resistance to
233
infection  is difficult  to demonstrate conclusively.
Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that an optimal
diet enhances the functioning of cellular and humoral
components of the immune system.

Vaccines and vaccination
Vaccination
Passive immunization can be used to confer temporary
immunity against an infectious agent or its products.
Although transferred antibodies give immediate protection.
the duration of protection is limited since the transferred
antibodies are catabolized in the recipient. In contrast,
active immunization, which involves the administration of
antigen to a susceptible animal, results in the recipient
producing its own immune response which persists for a
much longer time than passive immunity. In addition,
subsequent administration of the same antigen results in a
marked increase in the level of response obtained.
The process of stimulating protective immune responses in
them to non-pathogenic forms or components of the
microorganisms is referred to as vaccination. A successful
vaccine induces an effective adaptive immune response
directed at appropriate target antigens on the pathogen
without causing disease in the recipient. Among the types
of vaccines currently in use or being developed are those
composed of inactivated microorganisms, live attenuated
microorganisms, microbial products, synthetic peptides
and DNA of microbial origin (Fig. 5.1). The duration of
protection following vaccination is influenced by many
host factors including age, immune competence and the
presence of maternal antibodies in the animal's circulation.
236
Through their ability to reduce morbidity and mortality,
vaccines can contribute to the alleviation of welfare
problems in domestic animals, to improvement in
productivity    and
to
 reduction
1n
the
need for
chemotherapeutic
 intervention.
Where
feasible,
vaccination is a highly effective method for controlling
infectious diseases in animals. In common with many
disease control measures, however, vaccination has
defined limitations. Effective vaccines for controlling
equine infectious anaemia and African swine fever are not
available  at present.   Protective immunity  against
Staphylococcus
aureus using
gvaccination cannot be
induced in a predictable manner and prevention of fungal
infections through vaccination has had limited success.
In a large population of animals of comparable age and
immune and health status, the response to vaccination is
not uniform. The immune response is influenced by many
genetic and environmental factors and the outcome of
vaccination tends to follow a normal distribution (Fig. 5.2)
A small percentage of animals have a weak response to
vaccination and if challenged might be susceptible to
infection. The majority of the animal population respond
adequately and a small percentage respond strongly to
vaccination. The addition of appropriate adjuvants to
vaccines can enhance and prolong the duration of the
immune response, decrease the antigen concentration
required for effective immunization and promote the
development of cell-mediated immune responses (Heldens
et al., 2008).
When feasible, effective and safe, vaccination is one of the
most cost-effective measures for controlling infectious
237
disease, not only in companion animals but also in
food-producing animals.
Some infectious diseases with
wildlife reservoirs, such as rabies, can also be controlled in
particular animal species through vaccination. The benefits
of vaccination,
therefore.
are not confined to reduced
morbidity and decreased mortality in vaccinated animals.
as transmission of zoonotic diseases such as rabies in the
human population can be substantially reduced by dog and

Inactivated vaccines
Infectious agents can be killed without substantia lly
altering the immunogenicity of their antigens which induce
protective
immunity.
Although
 most
inactivating
chemicals do alter the immunogenicity of infectious
agents, some, such
1as formaldehyde, cause limited
antigenic change. When preparing inactivated vaccines,
care has to be taken to ensure complete inactivation of the
infectious agents as the chemicals used can cause
aggregation of particles thereby allowing survival of some
microorganisms in the centre of aggregated material.
Chemicals used for the preparation of inactivated bacterial
and viral vaccines include formaldehyde, β-propiolactone
and ethylenimine. Many bacterial vaccines used in animals
are prepared by inactivating bacterial cultures (bacterins)
or rendering their toxins inactive (toxoids) by chemical
treatment.
239
A major limitation of inactivated vaccines is that some
protective antigens are not produced readily in vitro. In
addition, some components of killed vaccines can interfere
with host immune responses. Inactivated viral or bacterial
preparations can be partially purified and combined with
are processed as exogenous antigens in the body, many
inactivated vaccines can induce high levels of circulating
antibody but are less effective at stimulating cell-mediated
and mucosal immunity. As inactivated vaccines do not
contain agents which can replicate, a greater antigenic
mass and more frequent administration of vaccine (booster
injections) are required to achieve results comparable to
those obtained with live attenuated vaccines. Advantages
of inactivated vaccines include stability at ambient
temperatures, safety for recipients due to their inability to
revert to a virulent state, and a long shelf life
Live attenuated vaccines
Apart from the orf vaccine which is used in sheep, few
virulent living organisms are used as vaccines in animals.
The  virulence of living organisms is reduced by
attenuation, a process that involves adapting them to grow
under conditions whereby they lose their affinity for their
animals. The bacillus of Calmette-Guerin, a strain of
Mycobacterium bovis, was attenuated by culture in a
bile-supplemented medium over many years. Bacteria can
also be rendered avirulent using genetic manipulation.
Viruses can be attenuated by growing them in monolayers
prepared from species to which they are not naturally
240
adapted. Chick embryo attenuation has been employed
successfully for rabies virus.Prolonged culture of canine
distemper virus in canine kidney cells produced strains of
reduced virulence suitable for immunization of dogs.
Even without attenuation, antigenically related viruses can
be used to induce active immunity in certain species which
they do not normally infect. Measles virus has been used to
vaccinate dogs against distemper and, although these
viruses cross-react, matermal antibodies to distemper virus
in pups do not neutralize the live measles vaccine virus.
The use of turkey herpesvirus to control Marek's disease in
chickens is another example of protection induced by an
antigenically related virus.
Live attenuated vaccines have many potential advantages
over inactivated vaccines. They can be administered by a
number of routes and present all the relevant antigens
required for the induction of protective immunity since
they multiply in the recipient. They usually induce a
satisfactory level of cell-mediated and humoral immunity
at sites where protection is required such as mucosal
surfaces. Because they replicate in the body, adjuvants are
not required. Booster doses, if required, can be given at
widely spaced intervals as these vaccines induce a good
immunological memory.
Disadvantages of these modified live vaccines include
their possible immunosuppressive effects, especially in
young animals or where an immunode-ficient state exists.
While live attenuated vaccines have been used for decades,
the exact nature of the changes responsible for attenuation
is often unknown. The circumstances in which reversion to
241
virulence might occur cannot be predicted in a reliable
manner.   Live attenuated  viral  vaccines  can be
contaminated with infectious agents which can induce
disease   in   recipients.   Because  matemal   antibodies,
acquired through ingestion of colostrum, can neutralize
live viral vaccines, administration of such vaccines to
young animals should be deferred until maternal antibodies
have declined to low levels. The use of particular live viral
vaccines in pregnant animals is contraindicated because of
the risk of congenital defects in the developing foetus.
A live viral vaccine has a limited shelf-life and should be
refrigerated during transportation and storage to ensure its
viability. Comparisons of the immune responses to an
inactivated vaccine and to a live vaccine are illustrated in
Fig. 5.3.

Vaccines
produced
by
recombinant
 nucleic
acid
technology
Recombinant vaccines are classified into three categories
by the US Department of Agriculture (Mackowiak et
243
al.,1999). Type I vaccines are composed of antigens
produced  by recombinant  nucleic  acid  technology  or
genetic engineering.  Type  II  vaccines consist 
of
genetically attenuated microorganisms, and Type IHI
vaccines are composed of modified live viruses or bacteria
into which DNA encoding protective antigens are
introduced by cloning.
Type I  vaccines are composed of subunit proteins
produced    by 
recombinant
bacteria
orother
microorganisms. DNA encoding the required antigen is
cloned in a suitable bacterium or yeast strain in which the
recombinant antigen is expressed (see Chapter 9 ). These
vaccines usually contain adjuvants which are required to
enhance the immunogenicity of the purified antigen
derived from the recombinant microorganism.
Type I vaccines have been developed for a number of
bacterial and viral pathogens. They have been used against
the virus of foot - and - mouth disease, feline leukaemia
virus, and Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease.
Type II recombinant
 vaccines  consist  of   virulent
microorganisms that are rendered less virulent by gene
deletion/knock-out  or   site-directed mutagenesis. The
genome of large DNA viruses, such as herpesvi-ruses,
contains  many  non-essential
 genes. Using genetic
engineering techniques, an Aujeszky's disease vaccine in
which an attenuated virus lacking the gene encoding
thymidine kinase (TK) was developed. As TK is normally
required by  wild-type herpesviruses to replicate  in
non-dividing cells such as neurons, TK-attenuated
herpesviruses can infect neurons but are unable to replicate
244
in these cells. Such deletion mutants induce a protective
immune response in pigs. Deletion of the glycoprotein I
(gIj-encoding gene in porcine herpesvirus 1 permits
differentiation of naturally-infected pigs, which produce
antibodies against gI, from vaccinated pigs which do not
produce such antibodies. Thus, vaccination programmes
can proceed in countries where the disease is being
eradicated without interfering with serological recognition
and removal of infected pigs. Similar strategies have also
been used to provide vaccines targeting pathogenic
bacteria of veterinary importance. In these bacteria, genes
essential for key metabolic processes are often targeted for
modification. As an example, a live recombinant bacterial
vaccine prepared from Streptococcus equi TW928 was
designed, in which a 932-bp deletion in the aroA-encoding
gene was developed (Jacobs et al., 2000). Submucosal
administration of this knock-out vaccine confers protection
in horses. Attenuated vaccine strains can be detected by
PCR methods that confirm the genetic alteration in the
chromosome.
The failure of some vaccines used in veterinary medicine
to induce a protective immune response can result from
problems related to delivery. Development of delivery
systems that are effective, safe and convenient for
administration and suit animal producers' needs is
therefore challenging for those engaged in vaccine
production. The use of live viruses for the delivery of
veterinary vaccines is a possible solution to current
difficulties. Type IHI vaccines are composed of modified
live organisms called vectors into which a gene encoding
an antigenic determinant is introduced. This engineered
organism then serves as a delivery system in the recipient
245
In order to produce safe viralvaccine vectors it 1s
necessary to ensure that the vector itself does not pose a
threat to vaccinated animals or humans. This can be
achieved by attenuating the viral vector or by generating
live attenuated viruses with precise genetic alterations that
ensure their suitability as vectors
Recombinant nucleic acid technology provides a more
complete understanding of the genetic organization of
viruses, permitting the identification of suitable regions for
insertion of foreign DNA. Several types of potentially
useful viral vectors from a variety of viruses such as pox
viruses (including vaccinia virus and fowlpox virus),
adenoviruses, herpesviruses and retro-viruses, have been
developed (Sheppard, 1999; Meeusen et al.,2007)
Potential advantages of the use of viral vectors for vaccine
delivery include possible administration to large groups of
animals by aerosols or in water rather than by injection of
individual animals. Such mass administration procedures
would be particularly relevant to poultry and pig
producers. If properly designed, the vector should express
those antigens from the pathogen that are required to
induce a protective immune response thereby reducing or
eliminating the chance of disease in animals exposed to the
infectious agent in a modified live form. A distinct
advantage of vectored vaccines is that they can induce both
humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, including
strong cytotoxic T cell immunity. In addition, some
vectored vaccines may be capable of inducing local
immune responses on mucosal surfaces.
To ensure vector stability and the appropriate expression
of foreign DNA, only a limited amount of that genetic
246
material can be incorporated into the vector genome.
Consequently, each vectored vaccine can produce only one
or a relatively small number of foreign antigens in the host
animal for the induction of a protective immune response.
A possible complication of vectored vaccines is that they
acquisition of foreign DNA. Prior exposure of animal
populations to the virus used to construct the vector could
substantially limit the effectiveness of a vector-based
vaccine.
Currently a small number of viral vectored vaccines have
been approved for use in animals. A vaccinia vaccine
vector carrying the rabies G glycoprotein has been used
successfully as an oral vaccine administered to wild
carnivores inbait.The G
  glycoprotein  induces
virus-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated animals which
protect against rabies. Other examples include a canarypox
virus-vectored vaccine against canine distemper virus in
o     s   s
virus-vectored vaccine designed to protect against avian
influenza virus in poultry. Selected microbial diseases of
animals and vaccines produced by biotechnology which
are available for their control are presented in Table 5.1.

Synthetic peptide vaccines
If the structure of epitopes that can induce a protective
immune response is known, it is possible to chemically
synthesize
peptides
corresponding
totheseanti-genic
determinants. Only a small portion of antigenic molecules
interact with specific receptors on B cells and T cells. For
B cells, an antibody interacts with up to five amino acids
in its antigen-binding site. Epitopes for T cell receptors can
be composed of 12 to 15 amino acids.
248
The general approach with synthetic peptide vaccines is to
identify potential epitopes in the protein antigen and to
synthesize a series of peptides corresponding to that amino
acid sequence. The immuno-logical activity of these
molecules is then evaluated in vivo.This approach is
appropriate only for epitopes consisting of contiguous
amino acids referred to as linear epitopes. The majority of
natural  epitopes  are   non-linear   a
and are,  therefore,
dependent on the conserved three-dimensional structure of
the molecule. Antibodies induced by peptide vaccines may
not react with the native molecule and, in addition.
peptides are usually poor immunogens due to their small
size. Immunogenicity can be enhanced with appropriate
carrier molecules or adjuvants. Limited progress has been
made with synthetic peptides for the induction
1Of
protective immune responses against infectious agents.
DNA vaccines
One of the most significant developments in vaccine
production in recent years involves the use of DNA,
encoding microbial antigens cloned in a bacterial plasmid.
for immunization. The procedure involves injection of a
plasmid containing the DNA sequence for a protective
antigen whose expression is controlled by a strong
mammalian promoter. For an infectious agent expressing
that antigen, injection of this recom-binant plasmid into the
skin or muscle of animals may result in the production of
the protein inducing immunity against that infectious
agent. This leads to the expression in host cells of the
encoded genes with the development of a significant
immune response to the gene product in the recipient.
Unlike viral vectors, the recombinant plasmid cannot
249
replicate in the mammalian cells but transfected host cells
express the vaccine antigen. Methods of delivery include
direct intramuscular injection and the use of liposomes or
coated gold particles fired by a gene gun. Although
transfection rates appear low, antigen production has been
detected in animals vaccinated with DNA intramuscularly
for up to 6 months after injection. Because DNA
vaccination induces intracellular processing of antigen, it
seems to mimic a natural infection and is, therefore, an
effective method of inducing T cell responses. Even small
amounts of DNA can  stimulate strong cell-mediated
responses. Humoral responses, however, may not be as
high as those obtained by injection of a purified antigen. A
strategy in which priming with DNA vaccines is followed
bV
boosting with
attenuated viral vectors such as
fowlpoxvirus and modified vaccinia virus has produced
exceptionally strong immune responses (Ramshaw and
Ramsay, 2oo0 ). The success of consecutive administration
of DNA vaccines and attenuated viral vectors was
attributed to the ability of the DNA vaccines to generate T
cells of high affinity which were further stimulated by
boosting  with  non-replicating  viral  vectors.  Although
immune responses may be delayed following DNA
vaccination, a persistent response may occur. In contrast to
modified live viral
vaccines, maternal antibody does not appear to affect the
immune response in young animals. An advantage of
immunizing with purified DNA is the possibility of
antigen presentation in its native form as it would occur
during replication of an infectious agent in the body. By
this method of vaccination, it is also possible to select
genes for the antigen of interest without the need for a
complex bacterial or viral vector.
250
The safety of DNA vaccines remains unresolved. The
possibility that foreign DNA could integrate into the host
chromosome and induce neoplastic changes or other
cellular alterations has been suggested. It has also been
method of vaccination might induce anti-DNA antibodies
to the recipient's own DNA.
Reverse vaccinology
Availability of genome sequences for many infectious
agents offers the possibility of exploring the complete
proteome, which provides the potential for rational
selection of vaccine candidates. This novel approach is
termed reverse vaccinology and it can be combined with
functional  immunology  to  optimize epitope  prediction,
leading to development of DNA vaccines. Depending on
the nature of the infectious agent, approaches used may
differ.
Potential candidate vaccines have been developed using
reverse vaccinology for bacterial pathogens, namely
Bacillus anthracis (Ariel et al., 2002) and Leptospira
(Koizumi and Watanabe, 2o05 ). The completed genome
of Neisseria meningitidis group B (NMB) was searched
open reading frames (ORF) encoding surface-exposed
protein antigens, which could later be evaluated as
potential vaccines (Fig. 5.4) based on their ability to elicit
a bactericidal antibody response (Pizza et al., 2000; Tan et
αl., 2010 ). The candidate ORFs were amplified by PCR
and cloned into suitable protein-expressing vectors. Protein
produced from each individual clone was identified by
251
ELISA, then purified and assessed for immunogenicity in
an  experimental  animal  model.  Immunogenicity  was
confirmed using a standard serum bactericidal antibody
(SBA) assay, designed to measure the bactericidal activity
of the serum in the presence of specific antibodies which
bind to the pathogen and activate complement. Five
candidate antigens produced for a vaccine against NMB
were developed.
A recognized limitation of reverse vaccinology when
applied to the development of vaccines for pathogenic
bacteria or other pathogenic agents with complex genomes
is that the strain under investigation may not represent the
genetic diversity of the species. Comparisons of genomes
from  several   different
strains of bacteria such as
Streptococcus agalactiae underscores this issue (Tettelin et
al., 2005). In this case, a core genome of 80% exists
between all strains, with each new strain containing
approximately
18%
ofthe

consisting of unique DNA sequences. These sequences

Vaccine production
In contrast to the application  of  reverse  vaccinology
applied to pathogenic bacteria, a different strategy was
applied to the development of viral vaccines. Bluetongue
has been recognized as a viral disease of livestock for over
100 years. Current vaccines for this virus are not without
their problems and new approaches have been developed
to improve safety and protection. Reverse vaccinology has
253
been applied in the development of attenuated viral strains
that can confer protection (Roy et al., 2009). Traditional
bluetongue vaccines have relied on the provision of
attenuated virus following passage through chick embryos
or sheep. The nature of the attenuating mutations is
unknown and recent developments in reverse genetics may
provide a solution to this issue.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a member of the Reoviridae
family with a genome consisting of 10 double-stranded
RNA segments, each consisting of a unique ORF. A
complementary DNA (cDNA) copy of each ORF is cloned
into a T7 plasmid, between a flanking upstream strong T7
promoter and a downstream restriction site (Fig. 5.5).
These ten individual clones represent the complete genome
of BTV. T7 phage RNA polymerase produces individual
RNA transcripts in vitro for each genome segment.
Individual transcripts are initially assessed by denaturing
agarose gel electrophoresis, following which they are
co-transfected into a susceptible mammalian cell line and
overlaid with agarose. BTV plaques that develop can be
recovered and amplified by growth in tissue culture. In this
way, attenuated virus can be produced in vitro following
the introduction of directed mutations. These engineered
viruses are later tested in ruminant animal models to
identify the pathogenicity determinants of BTV. The data
generated can be used later to design a vaccine strain
containing several attenuated mutations
Adjuvants
Substances that have the ability to increase or modulate the
intrinsic immunogenicity of an antigen are referred to as
adjuvants. Typically, if adjuvants are mixed with antigens
before administration, they boost the immune response of
antigens of low immunogenicity. They also enhance the
immune response to small amounts of antigenic material.
Although the modes of action of many adjuvants are not
well understood, some such polyribonucleotides and
lipopoly-saccharides are recognized as ligands for toll-like
receptors on dendritic cells and macrophages.
255
For almost 80 years, aluminium salts have been used as
adjuvants. These salts promote antibody production in
primary immune responses through their stimulation of
TH2 cell responses. Formerly, it was suggested that the
adjuvant activity of aluminium salts was due to the depot
effect of these salts at the site of injection. Currently, the
effectof aluminium
1 salts is attributed to  local
concentration of antigen
and
improved    uptake  by

gcells
(Guy,
，2007).Macrophage
activation, IL-4 production by an unknown population of
cells and expansion of antigenspecific B lymphocytes are
among the effects associated with the use of aluminium
salts in vaccine preparations. At present, some of the best
understood adjuvants are those capable of acting as ligands
for toll-like receptors
which
recognize conserved
components of bacteria and viruses. These adjuvants
induce immune responses by activating macrophages and
dendritic cells. Adjuvants may possess a number of
different features relevant to the enhancement of adaptive
immune responses. These include depot formation, ability
       
5.1). Promoting antibody production was a common
outcome of adjuvant use with many vaccines. The inability
of many adjuvants to induce a strong cell-mediated
response, however, was a serious limitation to the
development of effective vaccines for particular microbial
pathogens. Induction of a protective immune response
against intracellular bacterial pathogens, many viruses and
protozoal  parasites requires  an  effective cell-mediated
immune response. Availability of adjuvants capable of
inducing strong cell-mediated immune responses to a

disease control programmes for food - producing animals
and

adjuvants relate to their formulation and their ability to
enhance antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells, to
activate antigen-presenting cells and to stimulate T
lymphocyte subsets, B lymphocytes or other cells which
participate
in
 antigen
recognition, processing 
and
presentation to lymphocytes. The place of adjuvants in the
development  and  clinical
use of vaccines has been
intensively
/  investigated
in recent years (Alving and
Matyas, 2005 ). As many of the potential vaccines being
produced
by
 recombinant
technology or other
developments in molecular biology are protein subunits or
even short peptides which, on their own, are weakly
antigenic, a new generation of adjuvants is required to
enhance their immunogenicity. Categories of adjuvants in
current use or being evaluated are listed in Table 5.2

Bacterial derivatives
Because complex bacterial derivatives are related  to
pathogen-associated molecular patterns, they can be
detected
1by  toll-like receptors and promote  the
development of adaptive immune responses. Evidence of
direct binding of bacterial derivatives to toll-like receptors
is  lacking, however, and it
t   is   established   that
lipopolysaccharide does not bind directly to TLR-4 (Guy,
2007). Although epidermal Langerhans cells express
mRNA encoding a number of toll-like receptors, these
antigen-presenting cells do not directly respond to toll-like
receptor agonists. Detection of natural or synthetic
agonists by toll-like receptors can orientate the immune
response towards a Thl cell or Th2 cell response, and a
number of immunostimula-tory compounds of bacterial
origin can induce Thl cell responses following detection
by toll-like receptors.
The adjuvant effect of mycobacterial cell wall components
such as muramyl dipeptides and trehalose dimycolate is
attributed to their ability to stimulate macrophages and
dendritic cells, interferon-y production and T helper cell
activity. The activity of monophosphoryl lipid A, a
derivative of lipopolysaccharide, is thought to be mediated
258
by interaction with TLR-2 (Del Giudice and Rapuoli.
2005). Enhanced migration of dendritic cells, generation of
THl responses, increased expression of co-stimulatory
molecules and production of IL-2, interferon-y and IL-12
are associated with the use of this derivative of
lipopolysaccharide.
Cytokines and related substances
A number of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-12 and
interferon -y3, have been shown experimentally to be
effective adjuvants, especially if combined with the
antigenic material. Altermatively, cytokines can be
administered as a single dose close to the time of
vaccination. Using cytokines to direct the immune
response in a given direction is a potential advantage of
Emulsions
An emulsion is a mixture of two immiscible liquids with
one dispersed throughout the other in small droplets.
Emulsions used as adjuvants can be water-in-oil emulsions
or oil-in-water emulsions. Oils used in the preparation of
water-in-oil emulsions include mineral oils, vegetable oil.

An oil-in-water emulsion, MF 59, contains squalene
stabilized by the addition of two emulsifiers, Tween 80
and Span 85. Unlike water-in-oil emulsions which are
considered as depot adjuvants, MF 59 seems to act through
localization of injected material in antigen-presenting cells.
This adjuvant, which is stable and highly versatile, has
undergone extensive trials. Current information indicates
that MF 59
9promotes TH2 celldevelopment and
preferential production of IgG antibody (Del Giudice and
Rapuoli, 2005 ). The strong adjuvant activity of MF 59 has
been demonstrated with  viral and bacterial  vaccines in
laboratory animals and in primates. A subunit influenza
vaccine incorporating MF 59 adjuvant has been licensed in
a number of European countries.
Biodegradable particles
Antigenic material can be either encapsulated into
biodegradable particles or carried on their surfaces through
262
particulate

ofthecarrier
r   particles    targets
antigen-presenting cells. Liposomes, membranous vesicles
of naturally occurring phospholipids, can act as effective
adjuvants for protein antigens which are incorporated into
the vesicle membrane. These biodegradable particles are
taken up by antigen-presenting cells, and their contents are
processed largely via MHC class II-dependent pathways
(Nataro and Levine, 2005 ). Uptake of liposomes can be
facilitated by coating them with antibodies to promote
interaction  with  receptors on  antigen-presenting  cells.

to
virosome-encapsulated antigens have been reported. It has
been reported also that mucosal application of virosomes
can elicit secretory IgA responses.
Structures derived from the outer membrane proteins of
Gram-negative bacteria have been employed as adjuvants.
These structures, termed proteosomes, can be produced by
detergent extraction of the bacteria. Outer membrane
proteins are highly hydrophobic and when isolated by
detergent extraction undergo protein-protein interactions
which result in self-assembly of structures resembling
vesicles. During manufacture, suitable antigenic material
can be incorporated into these structures with the exclusion
263
of detergent (Nataro and Levine, 2005 ). Another approach
involves the combination of antigen with preformed
lipopolysaccharide-solubilized proteosome particles. The
uptake by antigen-presenting cells and their ability to
promote THl-type responses. The interaction of outer
membrane   proteins   of  Gram-negative
bacteriaand
lipopolysaccharide
with
toll-like
receptors
on
antigen-presenting cells may contribute to the enhanced
immunogenicity of antigens complexed with proteosomes.
Virus-like particles are non-replicating recombinant viral
capsids with a structure similar to the virus particles from
which they are derived. These particles are formed by
self-assembly of viral structural proteins synthesized in
suitable eukaryotic or prokaryotic systems and accordingly
have the native conformation of viral antigens but without
the presence of viral nucleic acid. The immunogenicity of
virus-like particles is reported to be strong without the
requirement for an additional adjuvant. Extensive clinical
trials with these particles have been carried out with
favourable results recorded for a number of human viral
diseases.
Mineral salts
Although aluminium salts have been used extensively as
adjuvants for almost 80 years, their modes of action are not
well  characterized.  Another mineral salt, calcium
phosphate, has also been used for its adjuvant activity
Formerly, the activities of mineral salts were attributed to
their depot effect and to the site of injection. Current
information on the activities of mineral salts suggests that
264
their adjuvant activity relates to activation of macrophages
and increased uptake of antigen by antigen-presenting cells
(Guy,2007).
When used as adjuvants, mineral salts stimulate an earlier,
higher and longer-lasting antibody response after primary
immunization than occurs with soluble vaccines. Their
stimulatoryeffect relates onlytoprimaryimmune
responses, as secondary immune responses are not
affected. These adjuvants promote antibody production
through the stimulation of TH2 cell responses.
Cell-mediated responses are stimulated minimally, a
serious limitation  of mineral salt-based adjuvants for
vaccines aimed at intracellular pathogens. Granulomatous
reactions, which can persist for many months at the site of
injection, are an undesirable response to the inclusion of
mineral salts in vaccines.
Saponins and immunostimulating complexes
Triterpene glycosides, isolated from the bark of the South
American tree Quillaja saponaria Molina, referred to as
saponins, have both toxic and adjuvant properties.
Saponin-based adjuvants augment both TH1-and TH2-type
responses. Fractionation has been used to select less toxic
saponins, and semi-synthetic saponin derivatives have
been developed (Guy, 2007 ).
Immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs) containing the
saponin Quil A, cholesterol and phospholipids, are
cage-like   structures into  which antigen  can be
incorporated.   ISCOM-based    vaccines   promote  both
humoral immunity and cell-mediated immune responses.
265
Iscomatrix, which is similar in formulation and structure to
ISCOMs, can be used without the incorporation of antigen
into the structure. Induction of immunity following
mucosal  administration    has    been    reported
1with
ISCOM-based vaccines. The effectiveness of ISCOMs as
adjuvants is attributed to their ability to interact with
macrophages and dendritic cells and to activate CD4+ T
cells.
Administration of vaccines
Factors
that  influence
 thesuccessofvaccination
programmes in animals include the nature, composition
and efficacy of the vaccine, the ages of the animal
population at time of vaccine administration, routes of
transmission of the infectious agents involved and the
methods used to administer the vaccine. In mammals, most
vaccines are administered by injection. For diseases that
affect particular systems, vaccines may be given by a route
that stimulates local immune responses at the usual site of
invasion. Accordingly, the intranasal route may be used for
vaccination against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis or
feline viral rhinotracheitis. When large numbers of animals
are involved, methods other than injection may be used. In
farmed fish, vaccination is an important method for
preventing infectious diseases. Depending on the nature of
the vaccine, injection into the abdominal cavity or
immersion of fish in a diluted solution of antigenic
material may be used.
Irrespective of the species of animals being vaccinated,
there should be strict adherence to the manufacturers
instructions, with clean equipment mandatory and vaccines
266
used before reaching their expiry date. Animals selected
for
vaccination
should
notbe
receiving
immunosuppressive therapy,  a
 and  animals  incubating
disease will not be protected by vaccination. An interval of
up to 10 days may elapse before vaccinated animals are
protected by their own active immune response.
Whendealingwith
pregnant animals,  timing of
vaccination should take account of the requirement for
colostral protection for newborm animals. Ewes should be
vaccinated 6 weeks before lambing to ensure high colostral
antibody levels, and vaccination of mares with tetanus
toxoid should take place at least 4 weeks in advance of
foaling. The administration of live viral vaccines to
pregnant animals is usually contraindi-cated because of the
risk of congenital defects in the developing foetus.
Poultry
A large number of vaccines are available for use in poultry
and careful planning should form part of the vaccination
programme. The flock history, type of production system
and local diseases prevalent in the region influence vaccine
selection (Cserep, 2008 ).
Most live vaccines are given in drinking water or by
aerosol. Because tap water usually contains chlorine,
another source of clean water should be used for
reconstitution of live viral vaccines. Some poultry vaccines
are administered by eye drops, by injection, in feed or by
wing web inoculation. In recent years, in ovo vaccination
has become an established procedure in many countries. A
number of live viral vaccines including Marek's disease
267
vaccine are administered by this route. The procedure.
using an automated egg injection system, is carried out at
18 days when transfer from incubator to hatcher takes
place.
Adverse reactions following vaccination
Even in clinically normal animals, vaccination is not a
risk-free procedure and adverse reactions can emerge soon
after vaccination or at a later stage. Undesirable responses
to vaccination may be a consequence of contamination of
the vaccine during
 manufacture, reconstitution
or
administration. Allergic reactions to vaccine components
can
occur,  especially  following repeated 
useof
preparations containing protein from tissue culture fluid or
chick embryo sources. Reactions at the injection site may
be due to the introduction of pyogenic bacteria during
injection, leading to abscess formation. Granulomas at the
site  of vaccine
 administration
sometimesoccur if
water-in-oil adjuvants are incorporated into the vaccine.
Neoplastic changes have been recorded at injection sites in
some species of animals. Adverse reactions following
vaccination may be related to contamination, survival of
infectious agents in the preparation, vaccine-induced
immuno- suppression, allergic
reactionstovaccine
components or neoplastic tissue changes at the site of
injection (BOX 5.2).

or administration of a vaccine, characteristics of the

Chapter 6
Molecular diagnostic methods
The characteristics of living bacteria are associated with
the genes present on their bacterial chromosome. This
structure consists of a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) helix with the properties required to control
replication of the bacterium, store its genetic information
and express some characteristics unique to the organism.
Despite its relatively simple chemical composition, DNA
has an incredible  capacity for directing ordered  and
complex functions within a bacterial cell.
All of the above properties are carefully controlled by
specific enzymes. For example, replication is controlled by
the enzyme DNA polymerase, which is required for the
formation of accurate copies of the original DNA
molecule. Synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) is
controlled  by  RNA  polymerase.   This  message  is
subsequently decoded in a process involving other
enzymes leading to the synthesis of a bacterial protein (see
Chapter 9 for revision of the structure of DNA and an
outline of replication and transcription).
Careful consideration of the chemical nature of the DNA
that can be used for analytical purposes. This has led to the
development of diagnostic molecular techniques designed
to detect features associated with the DNA of bacteria and
other microorganisms.
275
Analytical properties of nucleic acid
The analytical properties of DNA derive from its chemical
structure. These have been used to develop many of the
modern protocols for detection/diagnosis often reported in
the scientific literature. A DNA molecule has three
important analytical features which facilitate its use as a
diagnostic target:
Recognition properties: the base pairing rules in DNA can be
used to develop experimental methods, and to detect unique
nucleic acid sequences. This approach has resulted in the
development of molecular techniques including DNA probe
hybridization, DNA sequencing, the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and more recently, microarrays. All of these
seemingly complex techniques have one simple feature in
common: a given DNA sequence (termed a probe or a
primer) binds to its complement through base pairing
recognition. This binding event is detected through a signal
molecule associated with one or other of the binding
partners.
·Stability and robust flexibility: the DNA molecule is capable
of existing for centuries, even in a desiccated state. For
example, DNA has been detected in archeological material
taken from Egyptian mummies, and using appropriate
preserved specimens. Forensic investigations now make use
of DNA-based approaches to provide rapid results.
·Sequence features: when the DNA sequence of any cell is
closely examined, one of the key features noted is the
existence of repetitive strings of bases in DNA. This is
particularly noticeable in the human genome. An example of
this is the Alu sequences in human DNA. Repeat sequences
also occur in animals and microbes. Precisely what roles
these repeat sequences play remains to be determined.
Nevertheless, repetitive sequences have facilitated the
development of analytical approaches to investigate DNA

Using these three analytical features, powerful diagnostic
protocols have been developed, based on our knowledge of
DNA structure. Investigation of humans and animals for
disease traits using molecular methods has become a
reality. Based on our understanding of the chemical
properties of nucleic acid, strategies often encountered
include detection methods to identify the presence of an
infectious agent, including a bacterium or virus, exploring
tissue sections for the presence of cancer markers, forensic
analysis for identification purposes and other applications.
Collectively, these methods are referred to as molecular
diagnostics.
Several useful molecular methods have been developed,
application  point 
for   various  molecular   diagnostic
techniques is shown. All of these methods are based on
concepts involving replication and transcription (Chapter
9).
Molecular hybridization
277
If a DNA (or RNA) molecule is labelled with a marker
(such as a radioactive or non-radioactive signal molecule),
it constitutes a DNA (or RNA) probe that can be detected.
This labelled probe contains a sequence of bases that can
find its complement, bind to it through hydrogen bonding
and be detected. These are the steps that form the basis for
all molecular hybridization methods. Any DNA probe.
under suitable experimental conditions, would be capable
of binding or hybridizing to its complementary strand in
solution (based on established DNA base- pairing rules). It
is this binding event that is subsequently detected,
depending on the nature of the signal marker employed.
Examples of molecular hybridization techniques include
Southern and northern blotting (Fig. 6.1).
Southern blotting (Southern, 1975) involves hybridization
between a labelled DNA probe (Fig. 6.2) and a previously
fragmented DNA template produced following the action
of a restriction endonuclease. These enzymes locate and
cut at specific sequences in double- stranded DNA. The
DNA digest pattern produced is then separated using
conventional
1agarose
gel electrophoresis.  After the
electrophoresis step, the DNA fragment pattern is blotted
on to a nitrocellulose membrane, which is later hybridized
with the DNA probe. Under stringent hybridization buffer
conditions, involving extensive washing of the filter with
salt solutions, a high degree of specificity is achieved,
allowing the probe to locate and bind to its complementary
sequence. Low stringency conditions can be achieved by
reducing the salt concentration in the washing solutions.
Radioactive isotopes such as
used as labels for DNA probes in earlier versions of this
technique, but have now been replaced by non- radioactive
278
affinity labels including biotin and digoxigenin (DIG)
Non-radioactive labels can be detected using streptavidin
and anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to either horseradish
peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase.
Northern blotting is a technique wherein a labelled probe
hybridizes to RNA separated by gel electrophoresis similar
to that described earlier.
DNA probes can also be chemically synthesized and
simultaneously labelled during this process. Use of this
approach permits the application of several probes
simultaneously, as might occur when the target sequence is
not precisely known. An example of a more recent
hybridization (FISH analysis). The latter is particularly
useful for locating genes on specific chromosomes in a
karyotypic array.  An older and a technically less
challenging strategy is in situ hybridization on tissue
Finally, western blotting is a technique that does not
involve nucleic acid, but rather a marked protein (e.g. a
monoclonal antibody directed against a denatured protein
and labelled with a reporter) binding to a complex mixture
of proteins  previously  separated  after  electrophoresis
through a polyacrylamide gel matrix.

DNA
sequencing
undoubtedlyrepresents the most
powerful analytical/diagnostic approach that exists in the
molecular armoury. Insight into the understanding of any
DNA molecule derives from its nucleotide sequence. The
nucleotide sequence can be used to deduce the primary
280
protein structure of the corresponding protein which can
later be compared with similar sequences from other
organisms. DNA binding  sites  and
1otherregulatory
features of genes can also be identified.
The DNA sequence of a gene can be determined using
either a chemical-based approach, developed originally by
Maxam and Gilbert, and/or an enzymatic- based method
developed by Sanger. The latter protocol, referred to as
dideoxynucleotide sequencing, is the most commonly
applied method. Its application on a routine basis has yet to
enter mainstream diagnostic laboratories due to the level of
technical expertise required. Nonetheless, many research
and diagnostic laboratories use DNA sequencing, and
increasingly avail themselves of the sequencing services
provided by commercial companies.
The technical principles on which modern dideoxy DNA
sequencing protocols are based involves the partial
replication of a short DNA sequence using all four
deoxyribonucleoside   triphosphates  
(dNTP)   and    a
chemically modified dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate
(ddNTP) lacking a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon on the
ribose sugar ring (inset in Fig. 6.3). Like hybridization, this
method is based on sequence recognition according to the
base-pairing rules and accurate enzymatic synthesis, which
are all features of the naturally occurring replication event.
When applied to DNA sequencing (Fig. 6.3), they can be
described as follows:
* primer hybridization,
·sequence reaction,
·detection,
281
·data analysis.
Figure 6.3 The Sanger dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing
method. A DNA fragment of interest is hybridized with a
on to which the next deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate
(dNTP) can be attached. Four independent reactions are set
up, one for each of the four dideoxyribonucleoside
triphosphate (ddNTP) bases. Using a carefully determined
mixture containing dNTP and ddNTP nucleotides (shown
in inset), a premature chain termination occurs at each
individual nucleotide in the sequence following the
incorporation of a dideoxyribonucleoside monophosphate
(ddNMP). A set of DNA fragments is produced in each of
the four reactions, as shown. These are subsequently
separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each
reaction mixture is loaded into a separate lane in the gel
and DNA fragments are then resolved. The DNA sequence
can be read directly from the gel.

The first step involves the annealing of a short primer

which a given dNTP or ddNTP, specified by the base
pairing rules can be added. If the former is incorporated.
the chain continues to be extended. Annealing and
extension continue on this DNA strand until a ddNTP is
incorporated, at which point further chain elongation is
inhibited. For each DNA fragment being sequenced, four
separate reactions are set up, each of which contains all
four dNTPs(dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP) and one of the
four ddNTPs (ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP or ddTTP). The
fluorescently-labelled reporter group, as shown in Fig. 6.3.
283
Ratios of dNTP to ddNTP are carefully adjusted to ensure
that pre-mature chain termination occurs at every single
base in the DNA fragment being sequenced. Enzymatic
synthesis of the complementary strand is catalysed by
DNA polymerase, and further enzyme activity is arrested
at the end of the reaction by the addition of formamide.
Each of the four reactions now contains a mixture of
nested radiolabelled/non-radiolabelled DNA fragments of
differing lengths, all derived from the sequence of interest.

fragments
are then separated
by

directly recorded from these bands after detection/
development of a suitable photosensitive film (e.g. an
X-ray film can be used). Using this approach 200-250
bases can be determined.

fluorescent dyes. DNA sequence reactions are carried out
as described in Fig. 6.3, using four different fluorophores,
each with a unique emission wavelength. Following the
completion of the four sequencing reactions, the contents
are combined and loaded into a single lane (a) and
electrophoresed. The identity of every fluorophore is
detected using a laser focused on a fixed position on the
gel (b). Each excitation signal is recorded and can be
viewed as a series of different excitation peaks with the
unique colour identifying one of the four bases (c). The
DNA sequence of the fragment is recorded automatically.

.In automated DNA
sequencing, either the bases (dye-terminator chemistry) or
the primers (dye-primer chemistry) can be labelled with a
fluorescent dye. For the dye-terminator format, the dNTPs
are labelled with four different fluorescent dyes, each
emitting a narrow spectrum of light when excited by an
argon laser in the DNA sequencing instrument. The Stokes
shift produced after excitation/emission is subsequently
detected and recorded. In a ‘four-colour one- lane’ format
(Fig. 6.4), samples are pooled following the completion of
the sequencing reactions as described above, and loaded
into a single lane of a separating gel slab or a capillary
matrix. An alternative approach using one fluorescent dye
is the ‘one-colour four-lane’ format. In this case, the
protocol steps are similar to those described in Fig. 6.3.
Data derived from the emissions produced by the dye
285
labels are captured and converted to nucleotide sequence
information. Automated DNA sequencing can facilitate the
determination of approximately 5o0 bases per run.
These data are subsequently analysed using one of a
number of algorithms, available over the worldwide web.
One of the first steps in this case is to attempt to determine
the biological function of the sequenced region. This
process is termed sequence
annotation and is used to ascribe a biological function to
the sequence determined. Later, some of the interesting
sequence features including DNA binding regions and
others can be highlighted.
RNA can also act as a template for sequence, although it is
rarely used due to the technical superiority of the
DNA-based strategies.
More recent advances in DNA sequencing technology
have produced instrumentation capable of sequencing a
bacterial genome within hours.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed out
of the strategies used for DNA sequencing. Most of the
steps in a PCR protocol are very similar to those for DNA
sequencing. PCR was developed in the mid-1980s and is
probably the single most important molecular technique.
being applied almost on a routine basis. The typical PCR
protocol consists of three repeated steps, resulting in the
amplification of a discrete segment of DNA (or RNA, after
the addition of a reverse-transcription step, RT-PCR, see
286
below). In the first of these, the template DNA (derived
for example, from a crude preparation of genomic DNA
isolated from a microbial pathogen of veterinary interest or
from blood or other tissue samples) is denatured,
separating the two DNA strands (Fig. 6.5). This is
followed by an annealing step wherein the reaction
temperature is lowered allowing two synthetic DNA
primers (Fig. 6.5) to bind (hybridize) to the template.
These primers are located on opposite DNA strands.
Finally, the temperature is increased again (typically to
74°C) and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme begins
a round of synthesis. Collectively, all of these steps
constitute one cycle, and in a conventional PCR reaction
      s   
between temperatures allows amplification of a specific
DNA target by up to one million times.
Figure 6.5 Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
consists of three repeated steps, denaturation, annealing
and extension. The DNA template purified from a
microbial pathogen of veterinary interest is first denatured
at a high temperature to separate the two DNA strands in
cycle 1. Each DNA strand acts as a template. After
lowering the temperature of the reaction, a specific primer
(14-base single-stranded DNA fragment) is annealed at a
complementary sequence of bases on the template. Using a
mixture of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), a
thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme (usually purified
from Thermus aquaticus) extends the primer sequence,
according to the base pairing rules, to synthesize the
complementary strand. The product of the PCR reaction or
amplicon is detected using a conventional agarose gel.

Conventional PCR-based assays have been developed to
detect a broad range of pathogenic agents associated with
animals. These include the food-borne zoonotic pathogen
Salmonella. PCR-based detection methods can also be
used to identify the methicillin-encoding gene mecA in
288
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a
bacterium increasingly recognized in companion animals.
Molecular-based methods using primers directed against
the genes encoding the O-antigens located on the surface
of bacterial cells can be used to identify the important
pathogenic  serotypes  of  Escherichia  coli   including
enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), such as E. coli O157,
Ol1l and other isolates (Murphy et al., 2007).
Commercial kits are also available for identification of
these and other pathogenic organisms.
A potential limitation of DNA-based diagnostic methods is
that they detect both viable and non-viable cells. This
limitation can be overcome either by using an enrichment
     n  q 
RNA-based detection method using reverse transcriptase
(RT) mediated PCR in a protocol known as RT-PCR. As
RNA is produced only in living cells, only viable cells are
detected. RT-PCR differs from DNA-based PCR bv the
addition of a preliminary early step involving the
enzymatic conversion of RNA into a DNA copy of the
original template (cDNA)  in a reaction catalysed by
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase).
RT-PCR assays can be used to detect RNA viruses such as
rotavirus, coronavirus and norovirus
Real-time PCR
In 
contrast  to  conventional  PCR,  detection  and
simultaneous quantification of amplicons in real time is an
important enabling technology in molecular diagnostics.
The method facilitates the determination of the absolute
numbers of a DNA target relative to a normalized gene
289
within a living cell. Quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) can
be used to quantify bacteria, other microorganisms and
individual genes.
Real-time PCR has gained wide acceptance due to its
improved speed, sensitivity and reproducibility and the
reduced risk of carry-over contamination. The real-time
PCR instrument can be regarded as both a thermal cycler
and a real-lime fluorescence detector, thereby facilitating
the performance of automated procedures in a closed
system. Real-time PCR uses fluorescence to detect the
presence or absence of a particular DNA or RNA target. It
is this detection process that differentiates real-time from
conventional PCR.
A number of dye-labelling methods are currently used for
real-time PCR and these can be broadly categorized as
non-specific or specific. SYBR green I is an example of a
non-specific intercalating
dye
 that  binds
to
double-stranded DNA. As the amplification reaction
proceeds and PCR products accumulate over time, more
dye is bound and the fluorescent signal increases. Specific
dye labelling includes the use of Tag Man probes.
molecular beacons and sunrise probes (Table 6.1). A Taq
Man DNA probe is labelled on both ends with a
fluorophore reporter that emits a fluorescent signal, and a
quencher dye that absorbs the emitted radiation. In the
unhybridized form the emitted fluorescence is quenched
due to the proximity of the two dye labels. When
hybridized to the amplification product, the probe is
hydrolyzed by the 5'-3'-exonuclease activity of Taq DNA
polymerase, resulting in the separation of the two
290
fluorescent labels and an increase in the fluorescent signal
(Fig. 6.6).

the reporter dye to fluoresce. As the number of cycles

Expression of any gene in a microbe or other cell can be
determined by measuring the mRNA transcription using
RT-PCR. To determine the level at which a gene of
interest is expressed, mRNA transcribed under defined
conditions, such as at the mid-logarithmic phase of growth.
is measured and compared with a second gene, such as 16S
rRNA, the expression of which is independent of the
growth phase. The relative amount of mRNA produced
from the gene of interest is then compared with that
transcribed from 16S rRNA in the same sample. The latter
gene  is  regarded  as  a  housekeeping
gene and,by
normalizing expression of the gene of interest to 16S
293
rRNA, quantitative measurements of gene expression can
be made.
This technique is referred to as quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR).
The most impressive feature of PCR technology is its
ability to generate discrete DNA fragments from complex
genomic backgrounds, including humans and animals.
This feature makes PCR an attractive alternative to more
traditional diagnostic methods. Taken together with
additional   technological   innovations,   amplification
protocols based on PCR are becoming more common
(O'Regan et al., 2008). Commercial kits are now available
based on this protocol to detect and quantify a range of
pathogenic organisms relevant to veterinary medicine.
Diagnostic approaches to surveillance and subtyping of
bacteria, a comparison of phenotyping and genotyping
methods
Characterization of a veterinary pathogen is essential for
the support of epidemiological investigations of a disease
outbreak. Laboratory methods used must be capable of
identifying those organisms linked to the outbreak while
excluding isolates unrelated to the outbreak. Conventional
laboratory approaches are summarized in the top portion of
Fig.6.7.
These    methods    include    biochemical
identification, a method that discriminates between isolates
based on specific biochemical reactions and is usually
capable of identifying strains only to the species level;
serotyping applies specific antisera  to detect surface
O-antigens    associated    with   lipopolysaccharide    or
H-antigens among members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
294
This approach has been very useful for providing
information  on  certain bacterial serotypes linked with
clinical syndromes, such as the association between E. coli
O157:H7andhaemolytic
uraemic syndrome (HUS).
Antibiogram profiling is used for determining the
susceptibility profile of a bacterial isolate against a panel
of antimicrobial compounds. Phage typing is also used in
some disease outbreaks, in particular with the serovars of
Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium, to further
identify isolates. This diagnostic method suffers from poor
reproducibility and the necessity to maintain stocks of
bacteriophages  that require constant quality control.
Furthermore, some isolates lack the necessary phage
surface receptors rendering them untypable by this
method.

bacterial isolate prior to molecular investigation. Although
this procedure relates to a bacterial pathogen, the methods
used can be suitably modified for other infectious agents.

Whilst
some
 phenotype-based
methods, such
as
serotyping, have been used successfully, many are not
universally applicable and their use is limited to the
species
forwhich
 they  were  originally  developed.
Moreover, variable gene expression, resulting from the
loss or gain of genes, can alter the phenotype leading
to misidentification. These factors limit the reliability of
phenotype-based
 identification
for
surveillance,
 and
furthermore these methods suffer from poor discriminatory
ability.
The rapid development in molecular-based approaches has
led to the design of new diagnostic protocols that are
independent of the inherent limitations of traditional
methods (Fig. 6.7). Molecular subtyping methods target
variation within the genomes of bacteria whilst reducing
the
 limitations encountered with more conventional
phenotyping approaches.

Molecular   subtyping  for  definitive identification of
bacteria
Phenotype-based methods facilitate the identification of
bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Listeria
monocytogenes to the genus and/or species level. For
bacteria such as Salmonella, these methods are important
for identification of a specific serovar such as Enteritidis,
Typhimurium or other members of the 2,500 known
serovars. In the case of pathogenic E. coli, O-serotyping
defines the organism specifically as O157, O111 among
over 200 other O-serotypes. Bacterial subtyping permits
the identification of a bacterium below the species level
and provides the means of tracking an organism,
describing its molecular epidemiology and defining its

on its DNA fingerprint, and facilitates the recognition of
over 600 different E. coli O157:H7 subtypes and more
than1,800SalmonellaTyphimuriumsubtypes

recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) PulseNet network (Swaminathan et al..
2001）.
Bacterial subtyping is important as it can be utilized to
support quality control in food manufacture where
beneficial microorganisms (probiotics) are deliberately
added to food and drinks for health-promoting purposes. It
also has applications in tracking the source of bacterial
contamination  in  food manufacturing. Using bacterial
subtyping methods (Table 6.2), food-borne cases of illness
and outbreaks of infectious disease may be tracked through
the application  of DNA fingerprinting  to definitively
297
identify the aetiological agent involved, thereby linking
veterinary medicine with public health. Transmission
routes of MRSA between humans and animals have also
been identified by subtyping isolates and comparing their
DNA fingerprint patterns (O'Mahony et al., 2005;
Strommenger et al., 2006). In general, there are three
approaches to subtyping including restriction fragment
length  polymorphism
(RFLP)
 analysis,PCR-based
amplification   of  conserved
1  repetitive  sequences
1n
bacterial genomes and DNA sequencing. No single
subtyping method is routinely used by all laboratories and
each method has its own advantages and limitations. The
choice of method is influenced by the subtyping
information required and the equipment available.

Plasmid profiling
This original method involves the purification of all
plasmids from a bacterium followed by their separation on
an agarose gel where the plasmid profile can be compared
in a collection of bacterial isolates. It is a relatively easy
technique to perform and was used successfully to identify
different serovars of Salmonella. Application of this
method may be limited, however, as only a small
percentage of some bacteria such as Campylobacter may
contain plasmids. Nevertheless, plasmid profiling
1S
important when characterizing genetic markers associated
with antibiotic resistance.
Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA)
Total genomic DNA, including the chromosomes and
plasmids, is purified and subjected to enzymatic digestion
with a restriction endonuclease. The latter enzyme cleaves
at specific recognition sites in DNA, producing
a
299
multi-band
1pattern  or  restriction fragment length
polymorphic pattern detected after electrophoresis through
an agarose gel. The RFLP patterm produced is often too
complex to serve as a fingerprint and is difficult to analyse,
limiting the utility of this subtyping method. Moreover,
plasmids initially present in a strain may later be lost.
altering the banding profile and complicating comparison
of strains.
Ribotyping
Ribosomal-encoding DNA genes (rDNA) are naturally
amplified in bacteria and have been used successfully as a
target for identification. Large portions of these genes (the
rrs genes code for 16S rRNA and the rrl genes code for
23S rRNA) have been conserved throughout evolution. In
this procedure chromosomal DNA is purified and digested
with a suitable restriction enzyme, then Southern blotted as
outlined previously (Fig. 6.2), before hybridization with a
species-specific rRNA probe. The pattern of fragments
detected is referred to as the ribotype. Since these genes
are highly conserved, pathogens can be identified using
appropriately labeled 16 and 23SrRNA probes. These can
be designed for any organism(s) whose sequence is known.
Ribotyping has been used extensively for identifying a
range of pathogens including food-borne pathogens such
as Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella and other pathogenic
bacteria.
This analytical  method  is  labour-intensive and  time-
consuming. Its power of discrimination is poor compared
with other subtyping approaches. An automated ribotyping
system
wasdeveloped
1  that provides excellent
300
reproducibility and is capable of typing all organisms.
making standardized ribotyping more accessible. However.
the cost per sample is high and this laboratory protocol
may need to be used in conjunction with another subtyping
method.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
A major limitation with REA-based methods is the
complexity of  the fragmentation patterns  generated,
making them difficult to analyse. Macrorestriction analysis
can overcome thislimitation viathe digestion of the
bacterial chromosome using rare cutting restriction
endonucleases. These enzymes cut chromosomal DNA
into a small number of very large DNA fragments, which
can be resolved using
specializedelectrophoresis
equipment. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is
regarded as the gold standard in molecular subtyping (Fig
6.8). Bacterial cells to be subtyped are prepared by
embedding in agarose plugs to prevent shearing of the
DNA. Chromosomal DNA is then purified in these plugs
following lysis of the bacterial cell wall and digestion of
cellular proteins with a protease enzyme. Cell debris is
then removed by washing, and the plugs containing the
chromosomal DNA are now ready to be enzymatically
digested. A thin slice is cut from the agarose plug and
incubated at an optimal temperature in a suitable buffer
containing a rare cutting restriction enzyme (e.g. Xbal for
Salmonella).Following enzyme
digestionofthe
chromosomal DNA, the digested DNA fragments are
      s  i 
the orientation of the field is changed in a pulsed manner
(Fig. 6.8). This protocol causes the DNA fragments to
301
change their orientation in response to the direction of the
electrical field such that larger DNA fragments reorient
themselves more slowly compared with smaller digested
fragments. The resulting macrorestriction PFGE profile
produced consists of a small number of digested DNA
fragments ranging in size from 10 to 900 kbp depending
on the bacterium involved and the restriction enzyme used.
Some examples of rare cutting enzymes and the bacteria
subtyped using them are shown in Table 6.3.
PFGE is a highly discriminating subtyping protocol. Since
its development in the mid-1980s it has been successfully
applied to subtype several bacteria and used to determine
the  genetic relationships   between  case-related   and
unrelated isolates. As the method is relatively simple to
perform, standardizing the technical elements would
facilitate the comparison of PFGE profiles between
laboratories  nationally  and   internationally.   PulseNet
(www.cdc.gov/pulsenet) is an example of a globally
standardized and operated PFGE-based subtyping network
used to track food- borne pathogens across countries and
continents. Following the development of the PFGE
profiles as outlined above, the gel images of the DNA
fragmentation patterns are digitized and converted to a
TIFF file format. (All of these steps can be completed
within 24 hours.) The TIFF file is then exported to a
dedicated software program which analyses the PFGE
profiles, comparing them against other similar profiles in a
constantly expanding DNA fingerprint database. As the
system is operated under strictly standardized conditions,
these files can be exchanged between laboratories in
different regions of the world. This approach is often used
302
to track the dissemination of food-borne bacteria linked to
an outbreak of disease.
Figure 6.8 Analysis of the genome of Salmonella Dublin
is illustrated. The presence of all Xbal sites is determined
using a computer program available over the worldwide
web [http://insilico.ehs.es], followed by analysis using
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Total DNA of
Salmonella Dublin is isolated and embedded in agarose
plugs to prevent shearing of high molecular weight
molecules. All preparatory steps are performed in these
plugs. Xbal is added to the purified DNA and the
fragmentation pattern produced is resolved using a pulsed
electrical field. The pulsed electrical field alters the
direction of the current, thereby causing DNA fragments to
realign. Larger fragments realign more slowly than smaller
DNA fragments, thereby facilitating the separation of very
large (greater than 20 kbp) DNA fragments. On the basis
of the pulsed-gel results, one of the three isolates has a
profile distinct from the other two. These profiles are
sometimes called pulsotypes. In the illustration shown.
three different Salmonella Dublin isolates are digested
with Xbal, one of which is CT 02021853.

Although relatively simple to implement, the PFGE
subtyping method does suffer from  a number  of
limitations. These include the need for expensive specialist
equipment. The method is also labour-intensive and cannot
be automated.
PCR-based subtyping methods
Several
 PCR-based
subtyping
methods 
have
been
developed. In general these methods are simple to carry
 out and can be applied to any genome. Some of

the approaches are shown in Table 6.2. A brief outline of
four methods is given below.
Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
RAPD, also known as Arbitrarily Primed PCR (AP- PCR),
was one of the first examples of PCR-based subtyping
described. This method does not require any prior
knowledge of the organism's DNA sequence. It uses a
single short (10-mer) random primer and sub-optimal low
stringency annealing temperatures in a PCR reaction to
generate a DNA fingerprint. It is a relatively simple and
rapid protocol, producing highly discriminating DNA
fingerprints. Nevertheless, the method suffers from a lack
of
 reproducibility,  making  the  development  and
standardization of inter-laboratory protocols difficult. For
this reason, RAPD has not gained widespread acceptance
as a reliable subtyping protocol.
PCR-RFLP analysis
305
This approach can be applied to a gene target that exhibits
a high degree of polymorphism and therefore can be used
to discriminate between bacterial isolates. An example of
this is flaA subtyping used to subtype Campylobacter
jejuni isolates. In this example, the gene of interest, the
flagellin A subunit encoding flaA, is amplified by PCR
(Corcoran et al., 2006). The amplified PCR product is then
subjected  to  digestion
1using a suitable restriction
endonuclease, in this case Hinfl, producing an RFLP
profile. The RFLP profile is then used to compare different
isolates of the same bacterium. Other targets used include
16S, 23S rRNA and the interspatial region 16-23S rRNA,
fliC for Escherichia coli Ol57 and the coa-encoding
coagulase gene in Staphylococcus aureus.
As the method focuses on the polymorphism associated
with one gene to the exclusion of the remainder of the
bacterial genome, its power of discrimination is limited.
Furthermore, this approach is only suitable to describe
epidemiological links in a specific temporal setting such as
time and place and would therefore not be a suitable tool to
assess the molecular epidemiology in a global setting or in
a longitudinal study
REP-PCR
Bacterial genomes contain several examples of repetitive
sequences throughout their genomes. Examples of
palindromic sequence (REP), the 126-bp enterobacterial
repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) and the 158-bp
BOX repeat sequences (Table 6.2). REP- PCR makes use
of the nucleotide sequence conserved within the repeat
306
sequence to facilitate the design of primers located towards
the extremities of these repeats and which amplify the
DNA regions located between the repeats (Fig. 6.9). REP,
ERIC and BOX repeats differ in their location and copy
numbers between bacteria, making them attractive targets
with which to discriminate between different bacterial
species.
Unlike RAPD, REP-PCR is performed under high-
stringency annealing conditions. This feature increases the
possibility of standardizing this protocol. An automated
gel-free REP-PCR assay
has beendevelopedfor
Salmonella. In this example, a chip is used in place of an
agarosegel to resolve
eampliconsafter REP-PCR.
Associated software then converts the DNA profiles into
digitized formats as before and enters them into a strain
database which can be used to evaluate existing and new
patterms generated using standardized reaction conditions.
Amplification fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
AFLP has been adapted for use in bacteria. The method
does not require any prior knowledge of the target bacterial
genome sequence. Bacterial genomic DNA is first digested
with one or more restriction endonucleases to which
synthetic   short  oligonucleotide  adaptors  of  known
sequence are attached using the cohesive ends generated
by the restriction enzyme. This forms the sites to which
adaptor- specific DNA primers are annealed and used to
pattern of DNA fragments is produced following PCR,
ranging in size from 50 to 100 bp with between 40 and 200
307
bands that are resolved by conventional agarose gel
electrophoresis. In a  more recent development  a
fluorescent label can be attached to the adapter, being
subsequently
 incorporated  into  the  amplicon  and
facilitating its resolution and detection using an automated
DNA sequencer. The latter method is referred to as
fluorescent (F)-AFLP. DNA fragment profiles can be
managed as described earlier and used to compare with
other bacterial isolates.

different bacterial isolates showing the distribution of
repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) elements (shaded
boxes). Purified DNA is amplified with two REP-specific
DNA primers (indicated by arrows), which bind and
amplify the regions located between the repeats as shown.
The resulting amplification profile for each isolate is

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
Following
  technical 
Iadvances in
automatedDNA
sequencing allied to the associated falling costs, DNA-
sequencing-based  subtyping  has  emerged as  a new
approach to distinguish isolates of the same bacterial
species. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is an
example of such an approach wherein chromosomal DNA
is purified and short segments of seven housekeeping
genes are amplified prior to sequencing (Fig. 6.10). The
genes used for MLST analysis all encode protein products
essential to bacterial viability, and are therefore subject to
selective pressure.
These DNA sequences are then
compared. Based on the sequence differences
or
polymorphisms detected, each unique sequence is termed
an allele and is identified by a unique sequence type (ST)
number. ST numbers associated with these loci are then
309
used to compare isolates and infer genetic relationships
Bacterial isolates can be identified by a string of ST
numbers, and for two individual bacterial isolates where
the same ST number strings occur these isolates are
defined as being indistinguishable by this method. MLST
profiling is a very sensitive method that can be used to
distinguish between species within a genus including
Campylobacter jejuni. The method may also be used to
distinguish commensal E. coli isolates from pathogenic
variants of the same genus such as serotype Ol57.
Recently, this approach highlighted a human-to-poultry
adaptationevent
 involving  Staphylococcus
alreus
(Lowder et al., 2009). The latter study illustrated the
importance of subtyping to describe the impact of
globalization on the emergence of a pathogen of veterinary
and public health importance.
MLST protocols have been described for a variety of
important veterinary pathogens. The method is easily
standardized, and detailed protocols have been described
and can be found at www.mlst.net. For example, seven
primer pairs are used to amplify housekeeping genes in
Streptococcus zooepidemicus and the sequences of these
together with a complete list of each set of alleles are
contained in this database. Data entries are regularly
updated to include new isolates.

Unravelling  the
complex
details
arising
from the
interaction of a veterinary pathogen and its host is a key
step towards extending our understanding of the basis of
infectious
disease.
In
this
way,
important
pathogen-associated virulence markers can be identified
along with the delineation of the manner in which the host
311
cell responds. In the future this approach could lead to the
development of novel drugs.
Early examples of various hybridization techniques have
been outlined previously (Figs 6.1 and 6.2) and these can
be used to facilitate the identification of a specific DNA
fragment (Southerm blotting) or an mRNA molecule
(northern blotting) containing a gene of interest. Modified
hybridization protocols along with DNA sequencing and
RT-PCR can be used to identify and measure levels of
gene expression under carefully defined growth conditions.
In each of these examples, only limited information can be
obtained. In contrast, by measuring the total response of a
bacterial cell in which genes are up- and down-regulated,
an assessment of the global changes occurring in gene
expression across the genome can be obtained. In this way,
transcriptional signals following the growth of a bacterium
under different conditions can be determined. Similarly,
genes involved in infection can be identified following the
isolation of mRNA and hybridization to a DNA microarray
containing the known genes from a particular bacterial
pathogen
The development of DNA microarrays is based on the use
of a solid support to which a series of genes or chemically
synthesized segments of those genes from a bacterium or
any other organism of interest is attached. A technique
called  photolithography   was    adapted  to   produce
silica-based microarrays which, depending on the density
of the array, may contain thousands of DNA probes. As an
example the Salmonella DNA microarray in use contains
4,500 individual DNA fragments.
312
The genes on the microarray may represent either
complete amplicons obtained by PCR (Fig. 6.5) or
synthesized oligonucleotides containing part of a gene's
transcriptome of any organism, the array must contain each
gene identified following the determination of
the complete genome sequence. Usually each gene is
spotted more than once on to the array and at different
locations as a control measure. Once attached to the
solid-phase support, mRNA purified from a bacterial cell
being studied can be hybridized and DNA fragments or
probes on the microarray that bind to these mRNA
molecules can be identified. Hybridizing signals represent
the set of genes that are expressed in the bacterial cell,
cultured under defined conditions (Fig. 6.11).
Figure 6.11 Illustration showing the key steps involved in
DNA microarray analysis.  Preparation of the DNA
microarray involves selection of genes for inclusion on the
array. Selected genes are amplified by PCR or synthesized
chemically and are fixed in position at specific locations
[         
isolates. cDNA is synthesized using an RT-PCR reaction.
The cDNA from each isolate is labelled with a unique
fluorescent dye as shown. The labelled cDNAs are
combined and then hybridized to the array. Fragments of
the labelled cDNA with complementary sequences bind to
specific probes on the array. The pattern of binding is
subsequently detected by scanning the array slide to detect
fluorescence. Where only one of the two labelled cDNA
binds, the corresponding fluorescent signal is detected. At
positions where both probes bind, a signal based on a
combination of both fluorescent dyes is detected.

In bacteria, mRNA has a short half-life and is usually

. To use mRNA to probe a DNA
microarray, the mRNA must be amplified in a RT-PCR
reaction and labelled with a fluorescent dye (Fig. 6.11)
Once the hybridization step is completed, any mRNA-
derived labelled amplicon is subsequently detected by
scanning the DNA microarray and analysing the pattern of
fluorescent spots with dedicated computer software. The
intensity
of
the
e fluorescent signal obtained
 gives a
quantitative measure of the expression of each gene. Genes
that are up- and down- regulated are identified and
314
clustered into functional groups. Expression of the genes
identified on the microarray can later be verified by qPCR
under the defined conditions used.
DNA microarrays can be used in several ways. The arrays
can provide useful information for identifying those genes
controlling growth of an organism under defined growth
conditions including aerobic versus anaerobic metabolism.
In
environmental   microbiology,  DNA  microarrays
containing 16S rRNA sequences can be used to identify
bacterial and other microorganisms present in a particular
environment. This DNA microarray is termed a phylochip.
Comparative genome  analysis makes use of DNA
microarrays to compare the gene index of different
serovars of Salmonella (Reen et al., 2005). DNA chips
have been developed to aid in the simultaneous
identification of a number of important pathogens
including bacteria and viruses that may share similar
niches.
Whole bacterial genome sequencing
The first bacterial genome to have its DNA sequence
completely determined was Haemophilus influenzae (1.8
Mbp) in 1995. Following advances in DNA sequencing
technology along with improved computing protocols for
managing enormous datasets, the numbers of whole
bacterial sequences being completed has risen quickly.
Currently there are 1,014 completed bacterial genomes
deposited in online databases, with more than 3,500 at
various stages of completion. Information obtained from
genome sequencing projects can aid our understanding of
infectious disease and microbial evolution.
315
The first technical approach to determine the DNA
sequence for a bacterium necessitated the construction of
an   extensive  library
1of  randomlygenerated DNA
fragments (Fig. 6.12). These short DNA fragments, from
the organism's genome are cloned into a suitable vector.
The DNA sequence from each randomly generated library
insert is then determined using Sanger DNA sequencing
(asoutlined
 previously).   Powerful   bioinformatic
computing tools are used to search the DNA sequences
from the library of cloned DNA fragments to identify
overlapping sequences. Using this approach, overlapping
library clones can be identified and spliced together until
the complete DNA sequence of the bacterium is
determined.
Advances in sequencing technologies and computational
analysis over the past few years have led to the
development of faster analytical approaches, so

The structure of bacterial cells
A typical bacterial cell is composed of a capsule, a cell
wall, a cell membrane, cytoplasm containing nuclear
material and appendages  such as flagella and pili
(fimbriae). Certain species of bacteria can produce forms
termed endospores or spores, which are resistant to
environmental influences. Some of the structural features
of pathogenic bacteria which are important in the
production of disease or may be useful for the laboratory
diagnosis of infection are reviewed in Chapters 10 and 13.
The principal structural components of bacterial cells are
presented in Table 7.1 and illustrated in Fig. 7.1.
Capsule
Bacteria can synthesize extracellular polymeric material
which is usually described as glycocalyx. In some bacterial
species this polymeric material forms a capsule, a well
defined structure closely adherent to the cell wall. A slime
layer is formed when the polymeric material is present as a
loose meshwork of fibrils around the cell. Most capsules
are composed of polysaccharides; Bacillus species such as
B.
.anthracis produce polypeptide capsules. Defined
capsules can be visualized by light microscopy using
negative staining techniques. Bacteria with well defined
capsular material produce mucoid colonies on agar media.
However, the capsules of most species of bacteria can be
demonstrated  only   by  electron  microscopy  or  by
immunological methods using antisera specific for the
321
capsular (K) antigens. The main function of capsular
material appears to be protection of the bacterium from
adverse environmental conditions such as desiccation. In
the body, capsules of pathogenic bacteria may facilitate
adherence to surfaces and interfere with phagocytosis.
Cell wall
The tough, rigid cell walls of bacteria protect them from
mechanical damage and osmotic lysis. As cell walls are
non-selectively permeable, they exclude only very large
molecules. Differences in the structure and chemical
composition of the cell walls of bacterial species account
for variation in their pathogenicity and influence other
characteristics

imparts rigidity to the cell wall. This polymer is composed
of chains of alternating subunits of N-acetylglucosamine

bacteria  can
 be  divided
intotwomajorgroups,
Gram-positive and Gram-negative. This colour reaction is
determined by the composition of the cell wall.
Gram-positive bacteria, which stain blue, have a relatively
thick uniform cell wall which is composed mainly of
peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, Gram-
negative bacteria, which stain red, have cell walls with a
more complex structure, consisting of an outer membrane
and a periplasmic space containing a comparatively small
amount of peptidoglycan (Fig. 7.2). The Gram-staining
procedure consists of a primary stain (crystal violet), a
322
mordant (Gram's iodine), alcohol as a decolorizer and a
counterstain (carbol fuchsin). The crystal violet penetrates
the cell wall of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria. Following addition of the iodine, a complex with
the primary dye is formed. The alcohol dehydrates the
peptidoglycan of Gram-positive organisms making them
less permeable to the crystal violet complex
than
Gram-negative bacteria. Thus the dye-iodine complex is
retained in Gram-positive organisms whereas it is removed
in  Gram-negative  organisms.  Both  Gram-positive  and
Gram-negative organisms absorb the counterstain but its
pink colour is visible only in Gram-negative organisms as
the deep purple colour of the crystal violet masks the pink
colour in Gram-positive organisms.

The
structure of the inner surface of the membrane resembles
that of the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas that of the
outer surface is composed of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
molecules. Low molecular weight substances such as
sugars and amino acids enter through specialized protein
channels, known as porins, in the outer membrane. The
outer membrane LPs, the endotoxin of Gram-negative
bacteria, is released only after cell lysis. The major
components of LPS molecules are core polysaccharides
bound to lipid A and long extermal polysaccharide side
chains. The polysaccharide side chains of the LPS
molecules stimulate antibody production and correspond to
the somatic

of
324
Gram-negative cells. Lipid A is the molecular component
in which endotoxic activity resides. On account of its
composition, the outer membrane excludes hydrophobic
molecules and renders Gram-negative bacteria resistant to
some detergents which are lethal to most Gram-positive
bacteria. Comparative features of the cell walls of
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are illustrated
in Fig. 7.3
The mycoplasmas comprise an important group of bacteria
without cell walls. Conventional bacteria, exposed to the
action of antibiotics such as penicillin, or other substances
which interfere with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, cannot
produce cell walls and are termed L forms.
Cytoplasmic membrane
The cytoplasmic membranes of bacterial cells are flexible
structures composed of phospholipids and proteins. They
can be observed only by electron microscopy and are
structurally similar to the plasma membranes of eukaryotic
cells. However, bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, with the
exception of those present in mycoplasmas, do not contain
sterols.  The inner and outer faces of cytoplasmic
membranes   are   hydrophilic   while   the   interior
1S
hydrophobic, forming a barrier to most hydrophilic
molecules. Only a limited range of small molecules such
as water, oxygen, carbon dioxide and some lipid-soluble
compounds can enter bacterial cells by passive diffusion.
Two major functions of the cytoplasmic membrane, the
active transport of nutrients into the cell and the
elimination of waste metabolites, require the expenditure
of energy. The energy required by permeases and other
325
carrier molecules for active transport of nutrients derives
from adenosine triphosphate. The cytoplasmic membrane
is also the site of electron transport for bacterial
respiration, of phosphorylation systems and of enzymes
and carrier molecules that function in the biosynthesis of
DNA, cell wall polymers and membrane lipids.

Cytoplasm
The cytoplasm, which is enclosed by the cytoplasmic
membrane, is essentially an aqueous fluid containing the
nuclear material, ribosomes, nutrients and the enzymes and
other molecules involved in synthesis, cell maintenance
and metabolism. Storage granules may be present under
certain
environmental  conditions,
usually
those
unfavourable for bacterial growth. These granules, which
may be composed of starch, glycogen, polyphosphate or
other compounds, can often be identified using particular
dyes.
Ribosomes
All protein synthesis takes place on ribosomes. These
structures are composed of ribonucleoproteins and are up
to 25 nm in size. They consist of two subunits, a larger 50S
subunit and a smaller 30S subunit. The Svedberg (S) unit
is a measure of sedimentation rate, which is dependent on
both the size and shape of a particle. Ribosomal
ribonucleic acid (rRNA) is complexed with many different
proteins and accounts for about 80% of the RNA of the
328
cell.Smaller amounts of transfer RNA (tRNA) and
messenger RNA (mRNA) account for the remaining
cellular RNA. Ribosomes may be present either in the
cytoplasm or associated with the inner surface of the
cytoplasmic membrane. During active bacterial growth and
rapid protein synthesis, individual ribosomes are joined by
mRNA into long chains known as polysomes.
Nuclear material
The bacterial genome is usually composed of a single
haploid circular chromosome containing double- stranded
DNA. However, some bacteria such as Burkholderia
species have two circular chromosomes, and others,
including Borrelia species, have a linear chromosome.
Small amounts of protein and RNA are also associated
withnuclearmaterial.
Thegenes in the bacterial
chromosome encode all the vital functions of the cell.
Bacterial genomes vary in size depending on the species.
Because of its length, the bacterial chromosome is
extensively folded to form a dense body which can be seen
by electron microscopy. The nuclear material can also be
demonstrated by light microscopy when stained by the
Feulgen method which is specific for DNA. During
replication, the DNA helix unwinds and both daughter
cells, produced by binary fission, receive a copy of the
original genome.
Plasmids, small circular pieces of DNA which are separate
from the genome, are capable of autonomous replication
Several different plasmids may be present in individual
bacterial cells. Copies of plasmids can be transferred from
cell to cell during binary fission or through conjugation
329
(see Chapter 9). Plasmid DNA may code for characteristics
such as antibiotic resistance and exotoxin production.
Figure 7.4 Bacterial flagella. A, Monotrichous (polar)
flagellum; B, amphitrichous flagella; C, lophotrichous
flagella; D, peritrichous flagella.
Flagella
Bacteria that possess flagella are motile. Many species of
Gram-negative bacteria have flagella. Although they are
rarely present in cocci, some species of enterococci and the
zoospores of Dermatophilus congolensis possess flagella.
Flagella are usually several times longer than the bacterial
cell and are composed of a protein called flagellin. They
consist of a filament, hook and basal body. The hook
functions as a universal joint between the filament and the
basal body. The basal body is anchored to the cell wall and
to the cytoplasmic membrane. The positions at which
flagella are inserted into the bacterial cell vary and may be
characteristic of a genus or family (Fig. 7.4). Motile
bacteria can move into suitable microenvironments in
response to physical or chemical stimuli.
330
Flagella can be demonstrated by electron microscopy, by
light microscopy using special methods and by serology
using antibodies specific for flagellar antigens. Motility
can be confirmed in young broth cultures using the
hanging drop technique or in a semisolid motility medium
containing tetrazolium salts.
Pili
composed of the protein pilin, are attached to the cell wall
of many bacteria. The number of pili on each bacterial cell
varies widely. They are most common on Gram-negative
bacteria and they may have different functions. They
frequently function in adhesion to host tissues with the
adhesin located at the tips of fimbriae. The pili of
Gram-negative bacteria are classified into four groups
based on the pathways through which they are assembled
(Proft and Baker, 2009):
·Pili assembied through the chaperone-usher pathway.The
principal pili in this group are the Type l pili, found in the
Enterobacteriaceae and some other bacterial species, and the
P pili of uropathogenic E. coli. These pili are formed by
linear, unbranched polymers of pilus subunits. They function
in adhesion and have been implicated in biofilm formation.
·Type IV pili. These pili are found in many Gram-negative
bacteria and in two Gram-positive genera, including
Clostridium species which are important causes of disease in
humans and animals. Type IV pili are composed of long
flexible fibres which frequently aggregate, forming bundles.
They function as adhesins and in biofilm formation but have
additional roles in DNA uptake during transformation, in
twitching motility.
331
· Curli pili. These are proteinaceous coiled fibres made of
repeating subunits of the protein curlin or CsgA. They have
been described principally in Saimonella species and E. coli.
Like some other pili, they are thought to play a role in
in induction of the inflammatory response also.
·CSl pilus family. These pili are associated with
enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)
Corynebacterium,Actinomyces，
Enterococcusand
Streptococcus species. Two types of pili have been
identified in Gram- positive bacteria: short thin rods and
much longer flexible pili. As in Gram-negative bacteria,
these pili function in adhesion to host tissues.
A unique type of pilus, the F (sex or conjugation) pilus.
functions in male or donor cells of Gramnegative bacteria
as a conduit for the transfer of DNA to female or recipient
cells. This pilus is constructed by a type IV secretion
system and involves the formation of a pilus which
contains a channel through which DNA travels from the
donor to the recipient cell. Conjugation is discussed further
in Chapter 9.
Biofilms
Biofilms can be defined as bacterial populations which are
adherent to each other and/or surfaces and are enclosed in
a bipolymer matrix. Bacteria exist in both planktonic (free)
or sessile (attached) forms in natural environments and
biofilms form when organisms switch to a sessile mode of
growth. The first step in biofilm formation involves the
attachment of bacteria
332
to a surface and the formation of a monolaver of cells. This
is followed by clustering of cells and the formation of
microcolonies. The biofilm then begins to mature with the
production of extracellular polymers and the surrounding
of the cell clusters by a hydrated exopolymer matrix.
Nutrients can reach the bacteria through open water
channels within the glycocalyx matrix of the biofilm
Quorum sensing is the regulation of gene expression in
response to fluctuations in cell-population density, and
cell-to-cell signalling required for biofilm development.
Quorum sensing is thought to be important in determining
biofilm thickness. Once maximum thickness is reached,
cell dispersion occurs which involves release of planktonic
          
new areas. Biofilm formation is discussed further in
Chapter 13.
Protein secretion systems
Bacteria require mechanisms to transport proteins from the
bacterial cytoplasm through the cell wall and the cell
membrane into their surroundings, and, in the case of
pathogenic bacteria, into the host cell. Gram-positive
bacterial proteins are secreted directly. In Gram-negative
bacteria, proteins must traverse a more complex cell wall
and these bacteria have evolved secretion pathways known
as secretion systems for this purpose. The proteins which
are transported are kmown as effectors and modulate a
variety of cell functions. Examples of effector proteins
include enzymes such as proteases or lipases, and proteins
which act as cytotoxins or promote apoptosis. Five protein
333
secretion systems or pathways, Types I to V, are described
in Gram-negative organisms. These systems are of major
importance in the pathogenesis of infections caused by
certain animal and human pathogens. One example is the
Type IHI secretion system of Salmonella Typhimurium
This system, which is well characterized, has a needle-like
structure and one of the functions of its effector proteins is
promotion of cytoskeletal rearrangements and uptake of
bacteria into the host cell.
Endospores
Dormant highly resistant bodies termed endospores are
formed by some bacteria to ensure survival during adverse
environmental conditions. The only genera of pathogenic
bacteria that containendospore-forming species are
Bacillus and Clostridium. Endospores, which are produced
inside the bacterial cell, show species variation in shape,
size and position within the mother cell. Because of the
resistance and impermeability of the spore coat, special
staining procedures which employ heat are required to
demonstrate endospores. The resistance of endospores is
attributed to their layered structure, their dehydrated state,
their negligible metabolic activity, their high levels of
small acid- soluble proteins (SASPs) and their high content
of dipicolinic acid (Fig. 7.5). Dipicolinic acid, which is not
found in vegetative cells, occurs in the core of the spore in
combination with large amounts of calcium.

The high calcium content may explain the extended
survival times of endospores in calcium-rich soils. In areas
of low soil calcium or in acidic soils, calcium may be
leached from spores, shortening their survival times. Small
acid-soluble proteins bind to the DNA in the core and
protect it from damage due to desiccation, dry heat and
ultraviolet radiation. Because spores are thermostable, they
can be destroyed with certainty only by moist heat at
121°C for 15 min.
When an endospore is reactivated, germination occurs in
three stages, namely activation, initiation and outgrowth.
Activation may occur in response to factors such as brief
exposure to heat, abrasion of
the  spore coat or
environmental acidity. If other environmental conditions
including

of
 adequate  nutrients
are
favourable, initiation of germination will occur. The spore

Cultivation, preservation and inactivation of bacteria
Appropriate conditions of moisture, pH, temperature,
osmotic pressure, atmosphere and nutrients are required
for bacterial growth. Bacteria increase in number by binary
fission (Fig. 8.1). The generation time, that is, the length of
time required for a single bacterial cell to yield two
daughter cells, is influenced by both genetic and nutritional
factors. Escherichia coli, a common enteric organism, has
a generation time of approximately 20 minutes under
optimal nutritional conditions. Bacterial pathogens have
generation times ranging from 30 minutes to 20 hours.
Long-termpreservationof  microorganisms usually
involves freezing procedures. Heat treatment or chemicals
can be used to inactivate bacteria
Bacterial growth
Following inoculation of bacterial cells into fresh broth
medium, the growth curve of the culture exhibits lag,
exponential and stationary phases, and a final decline
phase (Fig. 8.2). The lag phase is characterized by active
metabolism of the cells as they acquire various essential
constituents prior to division. Binary fission of the young
cells results in an exponential increase in numbers. A
straight line relationship is obtained when the logarithmic
number of viable cells is plotted against incubation time.
Exponential growth in a broth culture is limited and
eventually ceases because essential nutrients are depleted
and toxic metabolic products accumulate in the medium.
338
During this stationary phase, no increase in bacterial
numbers occurs; slow growth and division of a few
bacteria are balanced by death of others. As the bacterial
population enters the decline phase, old cells die rapidly
followed eventually by the younger cells. The resulting
rate of cell death is exponential. Abnormally shaped cells.
known as involution forms, may be seen in stained smears
from cultures in the decline phase. When maintenance of
bacteria in the exponential growth phase is required, a
chemostat consisting of a growth chamber connected to a
reservoir of fresh medium is used. As fresh medium enters
the growth chamber, bacteria are harvested and exhausted
medium and waste products are removed.
The size of bacterial populations is usually expressed
either as the number or the density of the cells present.
Cell numbers can be determined either as a total cell count
or as a viable cell count. The standard methods for
counting bacterial cell numbers are presented in Table 8.1.
Bacteria may be counted by direct microscopy, by colony
counting, by membrane filtration or by electronic methods.
Accurate cell counts may be required for specific purposes
such as vaccine preparation and for bacteriological testing
of water.

chemicals as sources of energy and carbon. Small
molecules may be metabolized rapidly or utilized to
synthesize macromolecules. Nutrient media for the
339
A       
particular growth factors for specific groups of organisms
Most bacteria require carbon and nitrogen in relatively
large amounts. In culture media, peptones are usually the
main source of nitrogen. Peptones, which
are mixtures of peptides and amino acids obtained by the
digestion of meat and other sources of protein, frequently
supply other essential nutrients such as phosphate,
sulphate, potassium, magnesium, calcium and iron.
Phosphates are essential for the production of nucleic acids
and molecules containing energy-rich bonds. Sulphates are
required for the synthesis of sulphur-containing amino
acids, and magnesium, potassium, calcium and iron are
important co-factors for certain enzymes. Trace elements
and certain growth factors such as vitamins are also
essential for bacterial growth
Physical and chemical factors which influence growth
In addition to nutritional factors, growth of bacteria is
influenced by genetic factors and by chemical, physical
and other environmental factors. Awareness of those
factors that limit growth is essential for the successful
culture and long-term preservation of microorganisms.
Growth of bacteria in culture is influenced by temperature,
hydrogen ion concentration, availability of moisture,
atmospheric  composition and osmotic pressure.  Most
pathogenic bacteria can be grown aerobically on a nutrient
medium at 37°C, close to normal body temperature.
Although the optimal temperature for growth of these
bacteria, termed mesophiles, is 37°C, they can grow at
temperatures between 20°C and 45°C. In contrast, many
340
environmental bacteria grow at temperatures outside this
range. Those with an optimal incubation temperature of
15°C are termed psychrophiles and those with an optimal
incubation   temperature

As most bacteria grow optimally at neutral pH, it is
standard practice to buffer culture media close to pH 7.
Bacteria require water for growth, and species vary widely
in their susceptibility to desiccation. The ability to tolerate
desiccation is determined by the cell wall composition and
the surrounding microenvironment. Moreover, the cell
wall composition accounts for the ability of bacteria to
withstand changing osmotic pressures. Change in the cell
wall composition, induced by the action of lysozyme or of
antibiotics such  as 
Spenicillin, results in protoplast
formation. These spherical structures lack rigidity and are
susceptible to osmotic change. In the animal body,
pathogenic bacteria without cell walls (L forms) can
341
replicate, causing chronic or persistent infections. Bacterial
cells in the environment are usually present in hypotonic
solutions and, provided that the cell wall is intact, they

and
microaerophiles (Fig. 8.4). Capnophiles, a fifth group, are
aerobic bacteria with a requirement for carbon dioxide.
Because they utilize metabolic pathways in which oxygen
is the final electron acceptor, aerobic bacteria require
oxygen for growth and they are incubated in air. In
contrast, anaerobic bacteria are unable to grow in an
atmosphere containing oxygen. These organisms use
fermentative pathways in which organic compounds serve

and catalase, obligate anaerobes survive only briefly in the
presence of oxygen. Facultative anaerobes are bacteria
which have the ability to grow well under both aerobic and
anaerobic conditions. Microaerophilic bacteria require a
reduced oxygen concentration for growth.
The cultivation of bacteria other than aerobes requires
special laboratory techniques. Strict anaerobes are cultured
in tightly sealed jars in an atmosphere from which free
oxygen has been removed. One commercially available
system employs a gas-producing envelope. On the addition
of water to the envelope, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are
released into the jar. A palladium catalyst, either in the jar
or attached to the envelope, accelerates the reaction of the
hydrogen with free oxygen in the jar to form water. In
addition, the release of carbon dioxide enhances the
growth of anaerobes. A more convenient alternative
system, in which oxygen is removed by reacting with
ascorbic acid contained in a porous envelope, has been
developed (Fig. 8.5). This system, which eliminates the
need to generate hydrogen, releases carbon dioxide into the
jar (Brazier and Hall, 1994). Moreover, this method is
suitable for culturing strict anaerobes. Anaerobic bags may
be used as an altermative to jars, and a number of such
anaerobic pouches are commercially available and are
suitable for use with small numbers of plates. Other
methods for the cultivation of anaerobic bacteria include
the use of specially designed anaerobic chambers which
are particularly useful when large numbers of specimens
are being processed. Media, such as thioglycollate broth
and cooked meat broth, with low redox potentials may be
used also but are unsuitable as the only isolation medium
347
for clinical specimens which frequently contain mixed
flora. Facultative anaerobes may over-grow
the anaerobes in the broth, making identification of the
predominant pathogen difficult
For the cultivation of microaerophiles, reduced oxygen
levels are required. A gas-producing envelope, which
delivers up to 10% carbon dioxide into a sealed jar, is
available commercially. This system is also suitable for the
cultivation of capnophilic bacteria.
Preservation of microorganisms
In order to produce modified-live vaccines and to maintain
stock cultures of the bacteria and fungi used in teaching
and
1research, microorganisms
must
be preserved
Preservation should ensure viability, freedom from
contamination and genetic stability. Subculturing can be
used
for theshort-term 
1preservationof bacteria.
Limitations of this procedure include death of some cells
and a risk of contamination and mutation. Long-term
methods   of
 preservation
include
efreeze-drying
(lyophilization), ultra-freezing in liquid nitrogen at -196°C
and freezing at -70°C. If properly used, these preservation
methods can maintain organisms in a hypobiotic state for

freezing can harm microorganisms, chemicals must be

agents such as dimethyl sulphoxide or  glycerol can
minimize the negative effects of freezing on the viability
of cells. Young actively growing cultures are less affected
348
by freezing than older cultures. Small vials containing
of a cryopreservative broth are commercially available for
freezing bacteria at -70°C. This system removes the need
for repeated freezing and thawing of stored cultures. A
single colony of the organism to be stored is inoculated
into the vial. Following mixing and holding for a short
period of time to allow the bacteria to adhere to the beads.
the vial placed in the freezer. For recovery of the
organism, a single bead is rapidly removed from the vial
under aseptic conditions and rolled across the surface of a
suitable non-inhibitory medium such as blood agar. When
freeze-drying is used as a preservation method, it must be
carried out under vacuum as bacteria are easily damaged if
desiccation   takes  place.
The microorganisms  are
subsequently stored in the dark in sealed evacuated
ampoules
Physical methods for inactivating microorganisms
Physical and chemical methods can be used for microbial
inactivation  or  inhibition.  Chemical  agents  include
antimicrobial drugs (see Chapter 11), disinfectants (see
Chapter 94) and food preservatives. Techniques that either
inactivate bacteria or interfere with their metabolism
include elevated temperature, low pH values, desiccation
and high osmotic pressures. Some of the methods for
preventing spoilage or limiting microbial growth in food
are presented in Table 8.2. Sterilization is the method
employed for the destruction of microorganisms on
equipment    used   in   microbiological  and    surgical
procedures. Physical methods for sterilizing equipment or
349
fluids are presented in Table 8.3. Sterilization procedures
are effective for the destruction of bacterial, fungal and
viral agents. However, unconventional infectious agents
such
 as
prions require
more rigorous sterilization
procedures. When dealing with bacterial endospores, such
as those of Clostridium species, heating at a temperature of
121°C for 15 minutes is required for inactivation. Factors
which may influence the effectiveness of sterilization by
heat are listed in BOX 8.1

When a population of microorganisms is exposed to high
temperatures, there is an exponential decline in the
numbers of viable organisms. Susceptibility to moist heat,
used in autoclaving, can be expressed in terms of the
thermal death time, which is the time required to kill all
bacteria in suspension at a given temperature. The thermal
death time is dependent on the initial size of the microbial
population. The decimal reduction time (D value) is the
time in minutes, at a particular temperature, required to
reduce the viable cell population by 90%. The D value is
inversely related to temperature and is independent of the
size of the initial bacterial population.

Chapter 9
Bacterial genetics, mechanisms of genetic variation and
genedatabases
Much of the genetic information in bacteria is contained on
a single chromosome located in the cytoplasm of the cell.
Bacterial genomes differ in size, a feature which
determines an organism's characteristic  traits or
phenotype. In this chapter an outline of the essential
features of a bacterial gene is provided along with the
biochemical pathway involved in gene expression. The
ns a a  s  s sn
are presented. Extrachromosomal DNA elements are
defined and their contribution to unique traits of a
bacterium are explained. The final part of this chapter
deals with recombinant nucleic acid technology and the
development of gene databases that can be used for
therapeutic and other purposes.
Properties of a bacterial cell, including those of veterinary
interest such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence, are
determined by the microbial genome. The genomic
chromosome, plasmids and bacteriophages (the latter two
structures provide additional genetic information and are
transient in some instances). Most bacteria are defined as
haploid with a single circular chromosome consisting of
double-stranded DNA. In Escherichia coli K-l2, the
chromosome is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule
of approximately 4.6 x 1o° base pairs, containing 157
RNA-encoding genes including ribosomal and transfer
354
RNA along with 4,126 bacterial proteins. Bacterial
chromosomes typically encode between 1,0o0 and 4,000
different genes. Individual genes (Fig. 9.1) consist of a
starting point, referred to as the start codon, composed of
the nucleotides ATG, an open reading frame (ORF) and a
stop codon (TTA, TAG or TGA)
Although the chromosome exists free in the cytoplasm, it
is compacted through super-coiling and looping of its
structure. The central tenets of genetics consist of the
expression of a gene from its locus on the chromosome or
on a plasmid through transcription (production of
messenger
RNA or mRNA synthesis) and finally
translation: decoding
gofthemRNAtoproducea
polypeptide (Fig. 9.2). Since the DNA is located in the
bacterial cytoplasm, it facilitates the simultaneous
transcription and translation of bacterial genes. The gene
sequence and its subsequent expression through these
biochemical  pathways  accounts   for  the   phenotypic
variation observed among bacteria (Fig. 9.2). Recently,
this has given rise to defined areas of research referred to
as genomics, functional genomics or transcriptomics and
proteomics.
Replication of bacterial DNA
As bacteria replicate by binary fission, the daughter cells
produced
are usually
 indistinguishable  genetically.
Replication of the chromosome in bacteria begins at a
specific location referred to as the origin of replication (or
origin), at a locus referred to as ori. It proceeds at a rate of
1,000 nucleotides per second. During replication, the
purine and pyrimidine nucleotides in each DNA strand are
355
accurately copied into two new double-stranded daughter
molecules. Each of these molecules is composed of a
strand from the parent molecule and a newly synthesized
complementary strand, a process termed semi-conservative
replication. As the two parent strands of the helical DNA
unwind under the influence of the enzyme DNA helicase,
each acts as a template for the synthesis of a
complementary strand. In this manner, two identical
helical DNA molecules are formed through the action of
the replicating enzyme, DNA polymerase. The ends of the
new, fully formed strands are joined by DNA ligase
forming circular chromosomes.

Transcription and translation, the expression of genetic
information
During transcription, one strand of DNA, the positive
strand, is transcribed forming a messenger RNA (mRNA)
molecule. This is mediated by the enzyme DNA-dependent
357
RNA polymerase that binds to the promoter region of a
gene, which is composed of two conserved DNA-binding
sites referred to as the -35 and -10 promoter sequences.
The two strands of DNA are partially unwound and locally
separate following whichmRNAis synthesized
Transcription continues until the RNA polymerase enzyme
reaches the termination signal. The information encoded in
the mRNA is translated into protein on a ribosome through
the
involvement of transfer RNA (tRNA).EachtRNA
molecule has a particular triplet of three bases, the
anticodon, which is complementary to a codon on the
mRNA. Each triplet of tRNA transfers a specific amino
acid to the mRNA on the nbosome where the amino acids
are enzymatically joined together, forming a peptide bond
and extending the polypeptide chain. Following the linking
of two amino acids, the tRNA molecule that carried the
first amino acid is released from the ribosome. Synthesis
of the protein chain continues until a stop codon on the
mRNA is encountered by the ribosome (Fig. 9.1).
Mechanisms contributing to genetic variation
Genetic variation may occur following mutation, in which
a change occurs in the nucleotide sequence of a gene, or by
recombination, in which new groups of genes are
introduced into the genome (Fig. 9.3 and BOX 9.1). The
genotype of a cell determines its inheritable potential.
However, only a small
1  proportion  of  the genetic
information  is  expressed under defined environmental
conditions. The phenotype represents those recognizable
characteristics expressed by the cellular nucleic acid.
Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax, has a capsule
358
that is expressed only in vivo and not when it is growing in
laboratory media. Thus, both the genotype of an organism
and its environment can influence phenotypic expression
Mutation
A stable inheritable alteration in any genome is termed a
mutation. A bacterium carrying a mutation is referred to as
a mutant. When the original parent and mutant are
compared, their genotypes differ and their phenotype may
also differ depending on the nature of the mutation.
Spontaneous mutations are the result of rare mistakes in
DNA replication and occur at a frequency of about one in
every 1o° cell divisions. Because a gene with altered base
pairs may code incorrectly for an amino acid in a protein.
the mutation introduced may result in a phenotypic change
(Fig.  9.4).  Mutational  changes may be beneficial or
conditions, selected mutations may provide growth
advantage for the mutant over the parent or wild-type
bacterium. Mutations can also be experimentally induced
by physical, chemical or biological mutagens.
Many viruses that infect animals have RNA genomes and
these may also undergo mutation. The spontaneous
mutation rate associated
1withthesegenomes
1s
approximately 1,ooo-fold higher than that occurring in the
host chromosome. Proofreading systems help to maintain
the fidelity of DNA genomes, but similar systems do not
exist to correct mutations in RNA genomes when they
occur, leading to higher mutation rates.
359
Mutations can be defined as transition mutations wherein a
purine/pyrimidine base is substituted for another purine/
pyrimidine, or transversion mutations, wherein a purine/
Types of mutation that may occur in bacteria are listed in
BOX 9.1. Point mutations involving one base pair or a
limited number of base pairs may not result in phenotypic
changes. In contrast, mutations in which many base pairs
are deleted or inserted can result in the formation of
nonfunctional proteins.  Extensive  changes that  affect
protein synthesis influence bacterial viability.
DNA may become damaged following contact with
mutagenic chemicals, through exposure to UV irradiation
and by other means. In general, the types of DNA damage
that can arise include damage to a base in the DNA
structure; single-strand damage requiring the removal and
re-synthesis of a new strand using the complementary
strand to guide the process, and double-stranded breakages
which are more serious. Different mechanisms are
available within the cell to manage the repair of damaged
DNA, and the choice depends on the type of damage to be
corrected. Repair of damage to an individual base or a
single strand is virtually error-free, whereas repair of
double-stranded breakages may require an error-prone
mechanism. An example
  of an error-prone  repair
mechanism is the SOS system from which mutations arise.
Once the damage has been repaired, the SOS system is
repressed and the further introduction of mutations ceases.
Genetic recombination
360
Recombination occurs when sequences of DNA from two
separate sources are integrated. In bacteria, recombination
induces an unexpected inheritable change due to the
introduction of new genetic material from a different cell.
This new genetic material may be introduced by
conjugation, transduction or transformation.
Conjugation
The transfer of genetic material during conjugation is a
complex process that has been extensively studied in the
enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. These studies have
shown that two strains of E. coli, F+ (male) and F
(female), participate in the process. The F+ strains are the
source of donor DNA, the fertility (F) plasmid, whereas F
strains, having no F plasmid, are recipient cells. The F
plasmid is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule 99.2
kbp in size. This plasmid contains genes required for
plasmid replication and the tra genes, which are involved
in mating pair formation. In addition, there are several
bacteria synthesize a modified pilus, the F or sex pilus
This pilus, through which genetic material can be
transferred, can attach to F bacteria (Fig. 9.5). One strand
of F plasmid DNA is unwound and is passed to the
recipient F bacterium in which a complementary strand is
then synthesized. Once a new F plasmid is formed, the
recipient is converted into an Ft bacterium.

that has acquired DNA from another bacterial cell by
recombination is termed a recombinant cell.

Because of the complexity of conjugation, conjugative
plasmids are relatively large, with genes occupying 30-kbp
or more. During conjugation, plasmid DNA is the genetic
material transferred. However, chromosomal DNA can
sometimes be transferred, especially when the F plasmid is
integrated into the bacterial genome. The F plasmid
integrates at specific sites in the bacterial chromosome via
insertion  sequence  elements in  a  process  called
homologous recombination. Upon integration, a high
frequency recombination (Hfr) strain is formed wherein
the F plasmid is contained within the chromosome at a
specific site. These sites represent regions of homology
between the chromosomal DNA of the bacterium and that
of the plasmid. During conjugation of Hfr strains, the
genes closest to the F factor origin of replication are
transferred first. The potential exists for transfer of the
entire chromosome. However, this
 is an umlikely
occurrence because transfer can take up to 1oo minutes
and is usually interrupted before completion. Typically, the
DNA strand being transferred breaks, resulting in only part
of the chromosome being transferred to the recipient
bacterium. The partial segment transferred must recombine
with the recipient chromosome in order to be maintained.

at high-frequency, the recipient cell does not become a F+

or a Hfr cell, as the transfer of the entire co-integrated
plasmid is not achieved.

involves direct cell-to-cell contact via the sex pilus. A
single strand of the plasmid moves through the pilus into

completed. This process gives rise to an altered bacterium

Although conjugation is most frequently associated with
Gram-negative bacteria, it can also occur in Gram-positive
organisms. A sex pilus is not formed in Gram-positive
bacteria; plasmid DNA can be transferred directly through
the cell walls when the bacteria are in close contact.
Plasmid transfer by conjugation has important ecological
significance,
particularly
where
antibiotic
resistance-encoding genes are concermed. A plasmid
containing an antibiotic resistance gene in a bacterial cell
can, under appropriate conditions, convert the entire
bacterial population
intosimilarplasmid-containing
bacterial cells (Fig. 9.5). This is one mechanism by which
antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be selected, through the
inappropriate use of therapeutic agents. Plasmid transfer
can also occur naturally in the gastrointestinal tracts of
animals, giving rise to commensal bacteria with altered
phenotypes.
Transduction
DNA
acquired either from
1 the original bacterial
chromosome or plasmid in a previously infected bacterial
cell can be incorporated into phage nucleic acid and
transferred by progeny of the phage to susceptible
recipient cells in a process called transduction. During a
lytic cycle, the phage acts as a vector so that DNA derived
from any part of the host genome may be transferred. In
temperate phages, transduction affects only those bacterial
genes adjacent to the prophage when a lytic cycle is
induced. Transduction which takes place during a lytic
cycle is termed generalized transduction and it occurs at a
low frequency of one cell in 10° to 108 transduced, for a
particular  bacterial  characteristic   or   genetic  marker.
367
Specialized transduction may occur when a prophage is
induced to undergo a lytic cycle by exposure to mutagens.
This type of transduction can result in the transfer of
[       s 
genes are copied to all phage progeny. A small number of
bacterial genes are excised with the prophage and some
phage  genes remain integrated in  the bacterial
chromosome when lysis occurs. In these circumstances,
the phage progeny are defective because some phage genes
are missing
Transformation
This process involves the transfer of free or ^naked’ DNA
containing genes on a segment of chromosomal or plasmid
DNA from a lysed donor bacterium to a competent
recipient. Natural transformation is uncommon and occurs
in only a few bacterial genera. Where transformation
occurs in particular bacterial cells, such cells are termed
'competent'. The competent cells can bind naked DNA
which is then transported into the cell. A specific protein
binds to the DNA and protects it from intracellular
nucleases; the DNA subsequently integrates into the
bacterial genome.
Transformation can be chemically or electrically induced
in some bacterial cells under laboratory conditions. This
approach is often used to introduce recombinant DNA
molecules into bacteria.
Examples of mobile genetic elements
Plasmids
368
Although most bacteria carry all of the genes necessary for
survival on their chromosome, many bacteria contain small
additional genetic elements, termed plasmids, which are
also located
1in the cytoplasm and can replicate
independently of the host chromosome. Many different
plasmids are known in Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria. Most are closed circular double-stranded DNA
molecules (Fig. 9.5) but some linear plasmids have been
identified in bacteria. Depending on their genetic content,
the size of a plasmid can vary from 1 kbp to more than 1
Mbp. Plasmids can carry genes that confer a wide variety
of properties on the host bacterial cell. Most are not
essential for normal survival, but they may offer a
selective advantage under certain conditions such as the
ability to conjugate and transfer genetic information,
resistance to antibiotics and ability to produce bacteriocins,
proteins inhibitory to other bacteria (Table 9.1). All
plasmids carry the genes required for their stable
maintenance. In some pathogenic bacteria, plasmids
encode virulence factors and antibiotic resistance.
Thousands of plasmids have now been described, and
these differ in size and genetic content and in their
incompatibility types. By definition, those plasmids that

incompatible.  Incompatibility (Inc) group typing  of
plasmids has identified several different incompatibility
groups in the Enterobacteriaceae. Plasmids belonging to

together. Inc typing schemes have also been developed for
bacteria such as staphylococci and pseudomonads. The

Salmonella and IncH plasmids are associated with the
development of clusters of resistance. Stable coexistence
of plasmids in bacteria provides the opportunity for the
reassortment of plasmid-containing genes leading to the
emergence of new antibiotic resistant structures.

The number of copies of a plasmid may vary, with some
present in high numbers. Plasmids may use host cell
enzymes for replication, and some plasmids can replicate
and be maintained in a small number of species. In
contrast,  other  plasmids  of the  IncP  and
1IncQ
incompatibility groups are described as promiscuous,
370
surviving in many bacterial hosts. Replication of most
plasmids, however, is not directly related to replication of
the host bacterium.
Distribution of plasmids between daughter cells is random
Plasmids in the bacterial cytoplasm may be transferred not
only during replication but also by conjugation and by
transformation, as outlined above.
The broad host range of some plasmids, together with their
ability to conjugate, contributes to wide dissemination, a
fact that accounts for the spread of antibiotic resistance
among bacterial strains. Emergence of bacteria resistant to
one or more antibiotics is significant in veterinary
medicine. This is correlated with the increasing use of
drugs for growth promotion in some instances and to treat
infectious diseases in animals. Importantly, in some cases
this may impact on human health where resistant zoonotic
bacteria such as Salmonella and Campylobacter may be
transferred to humans via the food chain.

Bacteriophages
Viruses that infect bacteria are termed bacteriophages or
phages (Fig. 9.6). There is considerable morphological
diversity among bacteriophages. Some are filamentous
with helical symmetry and others have icosahedral or
pentagonal heads with tails of different lengths. Structural
features of phages are illustrated in Fig. 9.7. Phages may
be either virulent or temperate, depending on their method
of replication (Fig. 9.8). Most phages attack only a small
number of strains of related bacteria, and therefore can be
described as having a narrow and specific host range.
Virulent  phages undergo  a  lytic
Ccycle inbacteria,
culminating in the production of phage progeny with lysis
of host cells. Temperate phages or prophages are usually
      a  
they may also be present as circular DNA in the cytoplasm
like plasmids. Prophages can also express some of their
genes which confer additional properties on the host cell.
Temperate phages can also undergo a lytic cycle, either as
a rare natural event or when exposed experimentally to UV
light or to other mutagens. A prophage in a bacterial cell
372
may
be
  responsible   for    changes   in   phenotypic
characteristics, a phenomenon referred to as lysogenic
conversion. The production of neurotoxins by certain types
of Clostridium botulinum is associated with lysogenic
conversion of host cells (Table 9. 1).

Replication of phages is similar in many respects to that of
animal viruses (Fig. 9.9). However, the protein capsid
usually remains outside the bacterial cell after introduction
of phage nucleic acid into the cytoplasm. The host
specificity of phages relates to chemical affinity between
attachment structures on the phages and specific receptor
sites on the bacterium. A repressor protein, encoded by a
temperate phage, is synthesized following entry, and this
repressor blocks the production of virion proteins. The
DNA of temperate phages is incorporated into host
373
genomes, usually at specific integration sites, and is
transmitted to progeny bacteria during binary fission.

Transposons are genetic elements that can move as a single
unit from
one
 replicon
(chromosome, plasmid 
or
bacteriophage) to another. This process is referred to as
transposition. Transposons (Fig. 9.10) do not possess an
origin of replication and only replicate as the host replicon
into which they are inserted replicates. Transposons
encode the necessary features to promote self-translocation
but do not possess their own origin of replication. The
375
frequency of transposition varies from 1 in 10? to 1 in 107
transposable  elements
pergeneration.Mechanisms
involved differ from classical recombination in that there
is little sequence homology between the transposon and
the  replicon into
which  they become  inserted.
Transposition could be described as a type of specific
recombination   as   umique 
 DNA  sequences on  the
transposon, the inverted repeats located at the extremities
of the structure and the target site for insertion, are
recognized by the transposase enzyme. An example of a
simple transposon
  is an insertion sequence element
denoted as IS (Fig. 9.10a), that contains only a
transposase-encoding gene required for insertion into new
locations. This gene of approximately 1,ooobp is flanked
by direct or inverted repeats. Several IS elements are
known and these differ in the numbers of nucleotides they
possess. Many bacteria possess multiple IS copies inserted
at different locations throughout their genomes.
Some transposons consist of a gene encoding resistance to
an antibiotic such as kanamycin in Tn5, as illustrated in
F1g. 9.10b,
,flanked by two IS50 elements, IS50L and
IS50R.  The former IS element is defective. Other
transposons also contain antibiotic resistance genes as
illustrated by Tn3 which encodes a β- lactamase gene (Fig
9.10c) along with other transposase genes (tmpA and tnpR)
required to catalyse the insertion and subsequent resolution
events. Another example of an important complex
transposon is Tn/546 which encodes genes conferring
resistance to  the  glycopeptide antibiotics  vancomycin,
teichoplanin and the formerly used growth promoter,
avoparcin.
376
Insertion of a transposon into a gene essential for bacterial
survival results in cell death
Integrons and gene cassettes
Integrons (Fig. 9.11) are derived from transposon Tn21
and these elements  can capture antibiotic resistance
encoding genes via an integron-encoded integrase (a
member of the bacterial integrase superfamily) that
catalyses a site-specific recombination. These integrons
possess a conserved structure (CS) on the proximal end
(known as the 5'-CS) containing an integrase gene (int/), a
a conserved distal region (3'CS) containing a qacE/7
conferring   resistance
to  quatenary   ammonium
compound(s), which are used as disinfectants, and a sull
determinant conferring resistance to sulphonamides. These
CS regions flank a variable central locus into which gene
cassettes are recombined. Gene cassettes are composed of
one or more open reading frames (orf) encoding antibiotic
ns o    p (a i
located at their 3'-end

Integrons are capable of capturing a variety of genes
encoding resistance to antibiotics such as aminoglycosides.
β-lactamases, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, rifampicin
and trimethoprim, and contributing to their mobilization in
response to environmental selective pressure. More than
60 different gene cassettes have been identified, with some
  pahn ssso a ad sussssod so
classical ‘head- to-tail' orientation. As these resistance
determinants are under the control of a single strong
upstream promoter (located towards the 3' end of int/), all
recombined gene cassettes are co-expressed. Therefore,
selective pressure imposed by the use of a particular
antibiotic can co-select for another resistance determinant
located within an adjacent gene cassette. Additionally,
exposing  integron-containing  bacteria  to  sub-inhibitory
levels  of  biocides  may  co-select  for antimicrobial
resistance.
379
Genetic engineering of bacteria in the laboratory
Useful genetic characteristics encoded by genes in the
DNA of a naturally occurring organism can be cloned into
a host bacterium in the laboratory, in a process referred to
as genetic engineering. These genes can be inserted into
plasmids forming recombinant plasmids. They can then be
introduced into bacterial cells (usually by transformation)
and propagated. The DNA fragments carrying the genes
that are selected are produced by either cleaving the donor
DNAcontaining
them,
using
suitable
erestriction
endonuclease enzymes or through direct amplification by
the polymerase chain reaction (see Chapter 6). Restriction
enzymes, which cleave the nucleic acid asymmetrically,
produce DNA fragments with cohesive or ^sticky’ ends. If
recipient plasmid DNA is cut using the same restriction
endonuclease as that used for donor DNA, the cohesive
ends
sof the donor and plasmid DNA will
be
complementary. The donor DNA fragment can be
incorporated using DNA ligase into the cleaved plasmid,
and in the process the plasmid is then restored to its
circular form (Fig. 9.12).
Propagation  of  the host  bacterial  cell produces  a
population of identical cells, known as a clone, in which
each cell contains a copy of the new recombinant genetic
material. The plasmid used to introduce the new genes is
termed  the  cloning  vector.  Recombinant  plasmids
containing the gene of interest express the desired trait.
Plasmids are used as cloning vectors because they replicate
independently  without integration  into  the  bacterial
chromosome. Some suitable bacteriophages can also be
used as cloningvectors.
380
Genetic engineering is currently used for the production of
vaccines, hormones and other pharmaceutical products
(see Chapter 5). Vaccines produced in this manner are
potentially safer than conventional vaccines. The genes
that code for the vaccine antigens can be cloned separately
from genes encoding replication of the parent organism.
Genetically engineered vaccines may therefore stimulate
an effective immune response without the risk of
introducing a pathogen capable of replicating in  the
vaccinated animals.
Genetic databases and bioinformatics
In 1977 the entire DNA sequence of the phage Φx174 was
      s  
exponential  increase  in  DNA  sequence  information
submitted to gene databases around the world. With
increasing volumes of data entries, including whole-
genome sequences for bacteria and other microorganisms,
the first of which was Haemophilus influenzae (1.8 Mbp)
completed in 1995, it has become impractical to analyse
this information by manual methods. This has necessitated
the development of specific computational tools to analyse
DNA information and identify
genesand
their
corresponding    polypeptide   sequences
along
with
regulatory features at a molecular level.
Bioinformatics is a new scientific discipline that relates to
the development of computer algorithms and statistical
techniques for analysing
  and
managinggenetic
information. These tools facilitate the rapid annotation of
genome sequences with identification of the position of
381
genes within the genome leading to the identification of
 genes involved in disease production.

and diagnostic reagents often use bioinformatics to ^data

interest are mixed or hybridized, and the gaps in the DNA
molecules are sealed with DNA ligase, forming the
recombinant DNA molecule. This recombinant molecule is
subsequently incorporated into a bacterium and a colony of
the clone containing the recombinant DNA is formed
duringculture.

Laboratory diagnosis of bacterial disease
Laboratory investigation of bacterial disease is necessary
for identifying the aetiological agent and, sometimes, for
determining the antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens.
A full clinical history including the age, sex, species and
number of animals affected and treatment administered
should accompany the specimens, together with a tentative
clinical diagnosis. In the absence of adequate clinical
information, procedures for the detection of relevant
pathogens may not be carried out.
Selection, collection and transportation of specimens
The accuracy and validity of the results of laboratory
examinations are largely influenced by the care taken in
the selection, collection and submission of samples to the
laboratory. The following points should be considered
when dealing with clinical specimens:
·Ideally, specimens should be obtained from live animals
before  administration  of antimicrobial therapy.  Samples
from dead animals should be collected, if possible, before
autolytic or putrefactive changes occur.
·Specimens from a site most likely to yield a pathogen should
be collected using procedures that minimize contamination.
·In warm weather, refrigeration of samples may be required.
Samples for bacterial culture should not be frozen.
Samples must be submitted inseparate leak-proof
containers. Each container should be labelled with the
identity of the animal, the type of specimen and the date of
collection. Specific regulations for transport of diagnostic

most jurisdictions and must be implemented. Secondary and
tertiary packaging in addition to the specimen container is
usually required
· For particular procedures, specimens collected must be
suitable for the technique to be carried out: for example,
formalin-fixed   sections  are   generally  unsuitable   for
fluorescent antibody staining.
Identification of pathogenic bacteria
The presence of pathogenic bacteria can be confirmed by
examination of stained smears, cultural and biochemical
characteristics  and
1   detection  by immunological  and
molecular methods.
Examination of stained smears
Staining methods routinely used in diagnostic bacteriology
are presented in Table 10.1. Gram-stained smears from
tissues or exudates are useful rapid procedures for
demonstrating bacteria present in large numbers. The
contrast between Gram-positive bacteria and tissue debris
is marked, rendering them easier to detect in smears than
Gram-negative organisms. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain is used
to detect pathogenic mycobacteria. Coxiella burnetii,
Brucella species, Nocardia species and chlamydiae can be
demonstrated in smears using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen
stain. The fluorescent antibody staining method gives
rapid, specific identification of bacterial pathogens in
smears and cryostat tissue sections. Although this
technique is suitable for identifying many
bacterial
species, it is particularly useful for pathogens such as
387
Clostridium chauvoei, spirochaetes, Campylobacter fetus
and Lawsonia intracellularis, which are difficult to culture

Cultural and biochemical characteristics
The selection of culture medium, atmospheric conditions
and other features essential for isolation are determined by
the pathogenic bacterium suspected. Routine isolation of
many pathogens involves inoculation of blood agar and
MacConkey agar plates followed by incubation for 24 to
48 hours at 37°C.

MacConkey agar, which contains bile salts, is selective for
many Gram-negative bacteria. This medium contains
lactose with neutral red as a pH indicator. If an organism
growing on this medium ferments lactose, the acidic
byproducts turn the medium pink. Non-lactose fermenting
bacteria metabolize the peptones in the medium,
generating alkaline byproducts which impart a yellowish
coloration to the medium and the colonies.

Plates should be inoculated using a streaking technique
which facilitates growth of isolated colonies (Fig. 10.1).
This is an essential step for the identification of pathogens
in  clinical  specimens  which  may  contain  microbial
contaminants. Such contaminants may derive from the
normal flora or from environmental sources. Definitive
identification of a potential pathogen involves subculture
of an isolated colony to obtain a pure growth which can
then be subjected to biochemical or other tests.
Morphological characteristics and biochemical tests allow
presumptive identification of a bacterial pathogen (BOX
10.1). Additional features, which may aid identification,
include pigment and odour production on both blood agar
and MacConkey agar, and the production of haemolysis on
blood agar. Definitive identification of bacteria is usually
based on biochemical or molecular tests and serology.
Additional tests can be used to aid identification of
particular organisms (Table 10.3).

Biochemical tests relate to the catabolic activities of
bacteria, and an indicator system is usually employed to
demonstrate the utilization of a particular substrate (Table
10.4). Because the range of sugars utilized by individual
bacterial species is usually limited, catabolism of different
sugars is frequently used for identification. Several
biochemical tests for the identification of bacteria. These
usually consist of a strip of plastic cupules containing the
requisite reagents for each test to which a suspension of
the bacterium for identification is added. The identity of
the organism can be deduced from the pattern of the

Immunological techniques
Serotyping is based on the immunological identification of
surface antigens on pathogens such as Escherichia coli and
other members
of
theEntero-bacteriaceae,
Listeria
monocytogenes,Pasteurellamultocida and Actinobacillus
pleuropneumoniae.
Immunological techniques such as fluorescent antibody
staining can be used for identifying bacterial
pathogens. Antigen capture and direct enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays have been developed for some
bacterial pathogens and require the immobilization of
specific antibody on a solid phase. The bacterial agent, if
395
present in the diagnostic specimen, is bound by the
specific antibody and can be demonstrated by an
enzyme-labelled antibody. Techniques using  immune
reactions may be combined with other methods for
improving
detection of  pathogens. Immunomagnetic
separation, in which magnetic particles coated with
antibodies to the particular pathogen bind the organism,
combines physical
and
 immunological methods.
Immunomagnetic separation is usually followed by either
cultural identification or molecular characterization of the
organism.
Phage typing
Techniques employing a  standardized  set of well
characterized lytic phages can be used for the further
identification of human and veterinary pathogens. The fact
that a particular phage is lytic for a limited number of
susceptible strains of bacteria allows differentiation by
phage typing. The pattern of susceptibility of a bacterial
isolate, tested against a panel of typing phages, establishes
its phage type, such as phage type DT104 in the case of the
multi-drug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium.  Some
phages, which lyse all members of a bacterial species, can
be used to identify organisms to species level. More often.
phages infect only certain strains of a bacterial species and
they can be used to characterize organisms at subspecies
level.
Phage

Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium and
Salmonella Enteritidis to provide additional information
396
for the identification and tracing of sources of infection in
outbreaks of food-poisoning
Molecular techniques
Selected molecular techniques can be used for the
detection and enumeration of pathogenic bacteria. These
techniques, along with phage typing and serotyping, may
also be of use in epidemiological investigations. In
addition, molecular techniques assist in determining the
virulence of an isolate by identifying genes associated with
pathogenic properties.
The main molecular techniques for pathogen detection are
described in Chapter 6 and include nucleic acid
hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In
nucleic acid hybridization, synthetic nucleic acid probes.
specific for a particular pathogen, are applied either to
prepared  clinical  specimens  or  to  genetic material
extracted from the pathogen. Probes can be designed to
detect DNA or RNA. However, the usefulness of RNA
probes is limited by the lability of the RNA molecule.
Nevertheless, diagnostic tests based on the detection of
RNA can be particularly useful in specific areas such as
food microbiology because they allow discrimination of
viable from dead microorganisms. Probes can be designed
strains of organisms within a species. For example, a probe
for the detection of the gene which encodes 16S ribosomal
RNA can often detect all members of a genus because it is
highly conserved in the species within a genus. In contrast,
intergenic regions display more variability and are useful
397
for designing probes to discriminate between different
strains within a species
Assays based on the direct detection of DNA or RNA are
relatively insensitive because they usually require large
numbers of bacteria (104 to 1o?) in the specimen. For
specimens   containing   small   numbers   of  bacteria,
amplification of the nucleic acid of the target organisms by
PCR can be used. After amplification of a specific
fragment of DNA, using either a DNA or RNA template.
the PCR product can then be identified by its
electrophoretic  pattern using appropriate size-  marker
molecules.
Methods employed for epidemiological investigations are
described in detail in Chapter 6. The selected technique
must be convenient to use and must discriminate between
     ss  n
epidemiological significance.  Restriction  endonucleases
can be used to cleave chromosomal or plasmid DNA to
generate fragments which can then be separated by gel
electrophoresis. Analysis of the resulting electrophoretic
patterns allows comparison of isolates.  Restriction
enzymes which cleave DNA in only a few places produce
large fragments which can be separated using pulsed-field
gel  electrophoresis, a   method
 frequently
used in
epidemiological studies.
Serology
Many potentially pathogenic bacteria are present as part of
the normal flora of a host or are common in the
environment. As animals are frequently exposed to such
398
bacteria, they may produce antibodies to these organisms.
Antibodies demonstrable in a serum sample are therefore
evidence of exposure to an infectious agent but they do not
necessarily confirm an aetiological role for that agent in
the animal sampled. Despite these limitations, serological
tests are used extensively for confirming infection with
particular pathogens in susceptible animals. Collection of
two serum samples approximately 2 weeks apart and
demonstration of a four-fold rise in antibody titre are
indicative of recent exposure to an infectious agent and,
together with relevant clinical signs, are frequently
accepted as confirmation of infection with a particular
pathogen.

Chapter 11
Antibacterial agents
Antibiotics
arelow
 molecular weight microbial
metabolites which can kill or inhibit the growth of
susceptible bacteria. The term ‘antibiotic’ refers to drugs
used to treat infectious diseases in animals, humans and
plants, and these substances may be naturally occurring,
semi-synthetic or synthetic.
Development of chemotherapy for bacterial infections
The convincing experimental work of Louis Pasteur and
the meticulous experiments carried out by Robert Koch in
the 1880s eclipsed the prevailing notions that infectious
diseases were caused by disturbances in the upper
atmosphere, chemical poisons or unspecified evil
influences. The germ theory of disease, promoted by
Pasteur and Koch, stimulated an interest not only in new
  o  s so on   s
treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria
Progress was slow and only a small number of scientists
took up the challenge of investigating chemicals for the
treatment of bacterial infections. Of these, Paul Ehrlich, a
German medical scientist with considerable experience in
immunology, undertook a detailed evaluation of hundreds
of chemicals as potential therapeutic agents. In the field of
immunology, Ehrlich had already proposed the side-chain
theory of antibody production which was a revolutionary
concept for the early 1900s. Ehrlich reasoned that there
must be chemicals, which he referred to as ^magic bullets',
400
with the ability to attach to specific microorganisms but
not to host cells. The 606th compound that Ehrlich
synthesized, the famous drug, arsphenamine ('Salvarsan'),
was an arsenical compound with selective toxicity: it was
active against the bacteria causing syphilis in rabbits,
monkeys and humans but was relatively non-toxic for
recipients. Arsphenamine proved difficult to use, however,
P s     s  o 
intravenously. Despite these limitations, arsphenamine
pointed the way towards more effective chemotherapeutic
agents.
A period of pessimism followed Ehrlich's work on
syphilis, and many scientists were of the opinion that
antibacterial chemotherapy was an unrealistic expectation.
Further significant developments in chemotherapy did not
experiments. In 1927, a German biochemist, Gerhard
Domagk, continuing Ehrlich's investigation of chemicals
(especially dyes), made an important discovery. A new dye
for staining leather, Prontosil Red, was non-toxic for mice
dye failed, however, to inhibit cultures of bacteria growing
on laboratory media. The results of Domagk's experiments
were published in 1935 and that same year French
scientists showed that Prontosil Red was converted in the
body to sulphonilamide. It was shown subsequently that
sulphonilamide was active against bacteria in the body and
also against bacterial  cultures growing on laboratory
media. The discovery
of sulphonilamide stimulated
widespreadresearchonrelated
1compounds with
therapeutic activity and, by 1945, thousands of derivatives
of sulphonilamides, collectively called sulphonamides, had
401
been evaluated for their toxicity and antibacterial activity.
Many
of these sulphonamides, which were less toxic and more
effective than sulphanilamide, are still used for treating
bacterial infections.
Arsphenamine andsulphonamides
areexamplesof
synthetic chemotherapeutic agents made by chemists. A
second category
yof chemotherapeutic agents, naturally
occurring compounds produced by microorganisms, had
been recognized as early&
as the 1870s. These natural
chemotherapeutic
C  agents  produced by  microorganisms
inhibit  the  growth
of
f other microorganisms and are
referred to as antibiotics. The first antibiotic used
therapeutically was penicillin. The discovery of penicillin
in 1929 by Alexander Fleming, a Scottish physician,
heralded a new era in chemotherapy, the age of antibiotics.
Although penicillin was actually discovered in 1896 by a
French medical student, Ernest Duchesne, his work was
forgotten. Fleming's rediscovery of penicillin, produced by
the fungus Penicillium, proved to be highly significant.
This naturally occurring compound was effective against
toxic than sulphonamides. Despite the importance of his
observation, Fleming's subsequent experiments suggested
to him that penicillin would not remain active for a
sufficient length of time after injection into the body to
destroy pathogens.  He discontinued his research  on
penicillin in 1931. The major problem with the evaluation
of penicillin was the difficulty of obtaining sufficient
quantities of the antibiotic in a purified form for clinical
trials.
402
With the outbreak of World War II, the need for treatment
of wound infections in Allied soldiers intensified and the
potential of penicillin as a chemotherapeutic substance was
gradually realized. Through the cooperative efforts of
Fleming with Ermest Chain，
Howard
1 Floreyand
co-workers, large-scale production, purification and testing
of penicillin proceeded apace. With the participation of the
US pharmaceutical industry, large quantities of penicillin
became available for human use in the early 1940s. The
dramatic success of this newly discovered antibiotic for the
treatment of infections in soldiers and civilians was
received with enthusiasm by the general population and
stimulated interest in the search for other antibiotics. In
1944, Selman Waksman announced that he and his
associates had found a new antibiotic, streptomycin,
produced by the actinomycete, Streptomyces griseus. This
discovery resulted from screening thousands of bacteria
and fungi present in soil for their ability to produce
antibiotics. Over the succeeding decade, microorganisms
producing tetracyclines, neomycin and chloramphenicol
were isolated (Table 11.1 and Fig. 11.1). The search for
new and more effective antibiotics continued into the
1960s and subsequently entered a period of decline. This
decline was attributed in part to the pharmaceutical
industry's response to the negative influence of drug
pricing and also to the exacting criteria set by regulatory
authorities to ensure efficacy and safety of new antibiotics
before their release on to the market.

It was widely considered that, by the 1970s, antibiotic
therapy had signaled the end of bacterial infections as a
significant cause of mortality in human and animal
populations. However, this premature 
optimism
1was
dispelled by the emergence of antibiotic resistance in many
404
bacterial pathogens, an intractable problem resulting from
the widespread use of these drugs.
Mode and site of action
The therapeutic use of antibiotics depends on their
selective toxicity: these drugs can either kill
(bactericidal)
inhibit
(bacteriostatic)
bacterial
pathogens without direct toxicity for animals receiving
treatment. The basis of the selective toxicity of many
antibiotics is poorly understood. However, biochemical
differences
in cellular structures
and/or metabolic
pathways  between   mammalian   and   bacterial   cells
frequently  account  for  selective  antibacterial  toxicity.
Penicillin, for example, inhibits cell wall synthesis by
[q     od  
cell walls. Only a small percentage of the large number of
known antibiotics exhibit sufficient selective toxicity to be
therapeutically useful. Individual antibacterial agents are
not effective against all pathogenic bacteria. Some are
active against a narrow range of bacterial species while
broad-spectrum antibiotics such as the tetracyclines and
chloramphenicol are active against many species

the

allowing host immune defences to eliminate the infection.
If this type of therapeutic agent is not maintained at
effective concentrations in the tissues, dissociation of the
drug/cell structure complex can occur, permitting bacterial
survival. In contrast, bactericidal agents cause irreparable
damage and bacterial cell death by binding irreversibly to
target
structures.
At
high
concentrations,
some
bacteriostatic  agents  can  be  bactericidal.  Antibacterial
agents may inhibit the synthesis of cell walls, nucleic acids
or proteins. In addition, they may disrupt cell membrane
function. The major classes of antibacterial drugs and their
modes of action are listed in Table 11.2.
Inhibition of cell wall synthesis
Because peptidoglycan is a unique component of bacterial
cell walls, antibacterial agents that prevent cross- linking
406
of peptidoglycan chains inhibit cell wall synthesis and are
selectively  toxic    for  bacteria. The  penicillins  and
cephalosporins comprise the largest and most important
class of antibacterial drugs that inhibit cell wall synthesis.
Their bactericidal activity relates to this effect in actively
growing cells. The basic structure of β-lactam antibiotics is
illustrated in Fig. 11.3. Semi-synthetic penicillins and
chemical side chains into the basic molecules. Differences
in side chains of the particular antibiotic influence their
spectrum of activity, stability and resistance to β-
lactamases. The mode of action of β-lactam antibiotics
involves binding to cell receptors known as penicillin
binding proteins (PBPs). In addition to interfering with
transpeptidation, many of these drugs promote autolysin
activity causing cell lysis
Because β-lactamases cleave the β-lactam ring rendering
the antibiotic ineffective, bacteria that produce these
enzymes are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. These
enzymes may be plasmid-mediated as in staphylococci, or
they may be chromosomally encoded as in many
Gram-negative bacteria. Tolerance to β-lactam antibiotics
exhibited by some bacteria may relate to an inability of the
antibiotic toinduce
eautolysin
activity.In  these
circumstances, although the cell wall is damaged and
growth is inhibited, the bacteria survive. Differences in the
structure  and
compositionofthecellwallsof
Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms determine
their susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. Because some
antibacterial agents cannot penetrate the outer membrane
of Gramnegative cells, their antimicrobial spectrum is
confined to Gram-positive bacteria.

Inhibition of cell membrane function
If the functional integrity of the cell membrane is
disrupted, macromolecules and ions escape from the cell,
leading to cell damage and death. Comparatively few
antibacterial agents act on the cell membrane; those that
target it are usually bactericidal. Because antibacterial
agents with this activity are more toxic for animal cells
than other classes of antibiotics, their use is generally
limited to topical application.
Inhibition of protein synthesis
A number of classes of antibacterial agents inhibit protein
synthesis. The selective toxicity of some antibiotics relates
to the difference in structure between prokaryotic (70S)
and eukaryotic (8oS) ribosomes. Such antibiotics bind to
receptors on the 30S or 50S subunits of bacterial
ribosomes. Aminoglycosides bind to 30S ribosomal
subunits and affect a number of different steps in protein
synthesis. This results in the formation of non-functional
proteins. Resistance to aminoglycosides may be intrinsic
due to lack of a specific receptor on the subunit. Extrinsic
resistance is conferred by plasmids, which may encode one
or more of three classes of aminoglycoside-modifying
enzymes capable of inactivating these antibacterial drugs.
In some bacteria, particularly anaerobes, the active
transportsystem
essential
for
theintakeof
aminoglycosides may be lacking
Tetracyclines enter cells by an active uptake process and
bind to receptors on the 30S subunit. They block
attachment of tRNA molecules to acceptor sites preventing
411
the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain
Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic which binds to the 50S
subunit, also prevents the linking of amino acids to
growing polypeptide chains. The antibacterial activity of
both of these classes of drugs is diminished if effective
concentrations are not maintained for the required period.
Macrolide antibiotics also inhibit protein synthesis by
blocking 5oS subunit activity. Although these antibiotics
are bacteriostatic, at high concentrations they can be
bactericidal. Resistance to macrolide antibiotics, which is
transferred through chromosomes or plasmids, involves
alteration of the binding site on the 5oS ribosomal subunit.
Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis
Many
 antibacterial
 agents
including
quinolones,
novobiocin, rifampin, nitroimidazoles and sulphonamides
inhibit nucleic acid synthesis (Table 11.2). The quinolones
and novobiocin act on enzymes which separate the strands
of DNA during bacterial replication such as DNA gyrase
(in Gram-negative bacteria) and topoisomerase [V (more
commonly in Gram-  positive organisms).  Although
novobiocin    is    active 
against staphylococci
  and
streptococci, because of its toxicity its use is limited to
local intramammary therapy. Rifampin, by interfering with
the activity of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, prevents
RNA synthesis. This antibiotic is active against Gram-
positive bacteria including mycobacteria. It is usually used
in combination with other antibacterial agents because of
the   rapid    development   of 
resistantorganisms
Metronidazole, the most commonly used drug of the
nitroimidazole class, causes breaks in DNA strands and is
412
particularly effective against obligate anaerobic bacteria
such as clostridia.

para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) as illustrated in Fig. 11.4.
When present at sufficient concentrations, sulphonamides
are utilized by the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase
instead of PABA, forming nonfunctional analogues of
folicacid. The
synthetic
pyrimidine    derivative,
trimethoprim, inhibits 
 the  activity of dihydrofolate
reductase, a later step in the synthesis of folic acid by
bacteria. When used in combination, the action of each
drug is potentiated resulting in enhanced activity against
bacteria. Potentiated sulphonamides are selectively toxic
413
for bacteria because animals can absorb preformed folic
acid from their feed.
Combined antibacterial therapy
When antibacterial drugs are combined for the treatment of
disease, the outcome is influenced by the particular
combinations used. An additive effect is produced when
the combined action of the drugs is equivalent to the sum
of the actions of each drug when administered separately.
A synergistic effect results when the combined action of
two drugs is significantly greater than the sum of effects of
each drug used separately. Indifference is defined as lack
of an enhancement effect when two drugs are administered
in  combination.  Antagonism  describes  the  reduced
effectiveness  of  combined   antibacterial  therapy  when
compared with the effectiveness of each drug alone.
These effects, which can be demonstrated in vivo and in
vitro, must be considered when selecting drugs for
combined treatment of infected animals. If a bacteriostatic
drug is combined with a bactericidal drug, antagonism may
occur. Bactericidal drugs, particularly the B-lactam
antibiotics, are effective against actively dividing cells. If
they are combined with a bacteriostatic drug, which
inhibits bacterial growth, their bactericidal activity may be
abolished.  Drugs
thatact
t synergistically include
sulphonamides and trimethoprim, which act at two
different sites in the folic acid pathway, and clavulanic
acid and penicillin combinations, in which clavulanic acid
inhibits B-lactamase activity, preventing inactivation of
penicillin.
414
Factors influencing antibacterial activity
The activity of antibacterial agents is influenced in vivo by
the site and rate of absorption, the site of excretion and the
tissue distribution and metabolism of a particular agent. In
addition, antibacterial activity can be affected by
interactions between pathogen and drug and between host
and pathogen.
Drug-pathogen interactions
The response of a bacterial pathogen to exposure to a drug
in vivo may differ considerably from that in vitro. The
environment in vitro tends to be constant whereas
various organs and tissues of a host. Following therapeutic
administration, the distribution and concentration of a drug
can vary widely. For example, some drugs can cross the
blood-brain barrier while others are concentrated in the
  s  s    
presence of bactericidal drugs such as penicillin, they may
survive and multiply later producing clinical disease.
Because of their location, intracellular bacteria tend to be
resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. A drug bound to
proteins and other tissue components may have reduced
effectiveness. Moreover, products  of inflammatory
reactions such as pus and necrotic debris may adsorb
antibacterial agents. The acidic environment in necrotic
tissue can also inhibit the activity of some antibacterial
drugs.
Host-pathogen interaction
415
Antibacterial drug administration can alter  the host's
immune response and may change the normal flora,
particularly on the skin and in the intestinal tract.
Disturbance of the normal intestinal flora following
therapy for salmonellosis may allow the development of a
prolonged carrier state. In addition, major disturbance of
the normal flora may permit overgrowth  of resistant
organisms leading to disease. In horses treated orally with
antibiotics, Clostridium difficile overgrowth can cause
acute colitis. Many inflammatory responses may be
modified by drug administration.  Acute responses can
become chronic if drug therapy suppresses the growth of a
pathogen while permitting its survival.

Antibacterial resistance
health problem, resulting in a reduction in the efficacy of
many common antibiotics. Emergence of resistance to
these antimicrobial drugs is an inevitable consequence of
the selective pressure arising from their use (sometimes
indiscriminate) in animal husbandry and human medicine
Resistance  to  antibacterial  drugs  is  an   increasingly
important problem in both humans and animals. In general
terms, resistance to antibiotics occurs as a result of drug
inactivation,  drug-target modification and decreased
intracellular   accumulation    associated   with   reduced
membrane permeability  (following a reduction in the
expression of outer membrane-spanning porin proteins) or
increased drug efflux (Fig. 12.1). Some of the underlying
genetic mechanisms involved include: mutations in
housekeeping-structural genes (such as gyrA which
encodes the A-subunit of the DNA gyrase enzyme) and in
regulatory genes (such as acrR, which encodes the
regulator of the acrAB-tolC tripartite efflux pump) or
altermatively through the horizontal acquisition of foreign
genetic material. Occasionally, resistance may manifest
itself through several mechanisms, as is the case with
tetracycline resistance.
In broad terms, resistance for an organism can be defined
resistance is chromosomally encoded and relates to the
general physiology of an organism arising from its existing
417
properties such as cell wall complexity, efflux mechanisms
or enzymatic inactivation of an antibiotic. In contrast,
acquired resistance can arise from a mutation in a resident
gene or the transfer of genetic material encoding resistance
genes via plasmids, bacteriophages carrying resistance
genes or transposons containing integron sequences. The
latter is a common method for developing a resistance
phenotype and includes the acquisition of genes for
B-lactamase enzymes which degrade B-lactam antibiotics
(penicillins and cephalosporins), the recently described gnr
genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones, and
plasmid-encoded efflux pumps.
When selection is maintained by drug use, resistant
bacteria become the predominant species in a population
and they may also transfer some of their genetic material
to susceptible bacteria which then become resistant. There
are several mechanisms that bacteria can use to transfer
resistance including conjugation (sexual pairing between
plasmid-containing (male) and plasmid-free bacterial cells
(female)), transformation (uptake of naked DNA from the
environment)
and
transduction
(mediated
by
bacteriophages).
Resistance to an antibacterial agent often results in
cross-resistance to other agents in the same class. This
form of resistance is encountered with sulphonamides.
tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and macrolides. As an
example, the use of tylosin for the treatment of pigs can be
associated with cross-resistance to erythromycin. Carriage
of several resistance genes by plasmids and transposable
elements often enables bacteria to become resistant to a
   ss     
418
bacterial genera and species. It is particularly common
among members of the Enterobacteriaceae,Pseudomonas
species and anaerobes colonizing the intestinal tract.

Resistance mechanisms
Increasing numbers of bacteria showing resistance to one

a consequence of this, some of these drugs have been
419
rendered therapeutically useless. Several mechanisms
account for bacterial resistance to antibiotics. The front
line of resistance is the external structure of a bacterial
cell, which provides a physical barrier to the entry of many
antibiotics. Other mechanisms contributing to resistance to
antibacterial drugs include production of enzymes by
bacteria which destroy or inactivate the drug, such as
B-lactamases and aminoglycoside kinases, and reduction of
bacterial cell permeability by altering porin production.
Bacteria may also develop alternative metabolic pathways
to those inhibited by the drug as exemplified by
vancomycin resistance.An antibiotic may be eliminated
from the cellthrough
theaction
ofa
a range
of
membrane-bound efflux pumps, or the target site of the
drug may be structurally altered, such as mutations in gyrA
and parC in the case of fluoroquinolones, rpoB for
rifampin and 23S rRNA for linezolid. Alteration of the
target site and enzymatic destruction of the agent are
probably  the  most common  mechanisms   whereby
resistance can occur. A summary of resistance mechanisms
in particular bacteria is presented in Table 12.1 and Fig.
12.1.
Multiple drug resistance
Multiple drug resistance (MDR) is of particular concern,
especially  in
zoonotic
 and
 nosocomial  
pathogens
Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 is one of the most
common causes of human food poisoning in the developed
world (Glynn et al., 1998). This strain emerged in the
1980s as a global health problem and was involved in
animal and human diseases. Salmonella Typhimurium
DT104 is characterized by a penta-resistance phenotype
420
ACSSuT (conferring simultaneous resistance to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol/
florphenicol,
streptomycin/
spectinomycin, sulfonamide and tetracycline). A genomic
island identified in this epidemic strain, the Salmonella
Genomic Island, SGll, was described by Boyd et al.
(2000). SGI1 is an integrated, mobilizable island 43 kbp in
size and located on the chromosome of some Salmonella
serotypes. On the right-hand side of this structure is a
13-kbp region containing all of the resistance genes
corresponding to the ACSSuT phenotype (Fig. 12.2). SGH1
is
 incapable of  independent existence outside the
chromosome; however, it can be transmitted to other
plasmid', which provides the mating apparatus (Doublet et
al., 2005). Identification of SGl1 in other Salmonella
serotypes from both animal and human sources provides
evidence of its wide distribution and of increasing numbers
of organisms displaying a multi-drug-resistant phenotype.
Other genetic arrangements containing antibiotic resistance
genes in Salmonella have also been described and these
involve mobile genetic elements.

publications including The Copenhagen Recommendations
(Rosdahl and Pedersen, 1998), recommendations issued by
expert committees in the UK (Anon., 1998, 1999) and the
USA (Cohen, 1998) and more recently in a report issued
by the FAO/WHO/OIE (2008). Effective surveillance
systems for collection of data on resistant organisms
should be established at local, national and intermational
levels. The supply and use of antibacterial drugs should be
closely monitored to allow evaluation of the risks and
426
benefits of therapy. Prescription of antimicrobial drugs
should be based on sound medical and veterinary
therapeutic principles. Ideally, antibiotic therapy should be
based on the results of laboratory examinations, and drugs
should be administered at the recommended therapeutic
dose and for the prescribed period of time. There should be
strict adherence to drug withdrawal periods following
treatment of  food- producing animals.  Antimicrobial
agents should not be used for growth promotion and
greater reliance should be placed on improved hygiene
measures, disinfection and vaccination for the prevention
and control of infectious disease.
Antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring systems, such as
the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System
(NARMS) for Enteric Bacteria in the United States and the
Danish integrated antimicrobial resistance monitoring and
research programme (DANMAP) in Denmark, provide
valuable information on resistance traits among food-borne
bacteria. DANMAP is unique in that it collects data on
both antimicrobial consumption and resistance in bacteria
from animals, food and humans and provides a temporal
relationship between usage and resistance (Bager, 2o00 )
Antibacterial susceptibility testing
Tests to determine the most suitable antibiotic for the
effective treatment in a given disease can be conducted on
isolates from clinical cases. However, these tests which are
carried out in vitro cannot allow for the various factors that
may affect antibacterial activity in vivo. The results
obtained following treatment may not reflect the
susceptibility pattern of an isolate as determined in the
427
laboratory. A number of antibacterial susceptibility tests
are available including broth dilution, disc diffusion, agar
gradient and some automated methods (Jorgensen et al.,
1999). The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method is a flexible
and relatively inexpensive technique that is commonly
used in diagnostic laboratories. This standard procedure is
based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
protocols (CLSI, 2008) and is used mainly for testing
rapidly growing aerobic bacteria. Filter paper discs
containing specified amounts of antibacterial agents are
placed on agar uniformly seeded with the test bacterium.
The procedure and the method of interpretation are
indicated in Fig. 12.4. The diameter of each zone of
inhibition is measured in millimetres (from three separate
directions, taking the average diameter) and the results
compared with standards for interpretation of the zone size
(CLSI, 2008). Susceptibility to an antibacterial drug
indicates that the infection caused by the bacterium may
respond to treatment if the drug reaches therapeutic levels
at the site of infection.
Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration
Laboratory procedures  for  determining  the  minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) are illustrated in Figs 12.5
and 12.6. The MIC of an antibacterial agent for a specific
bacterium can be determined in vitro. The MIC is the
highest dilution of an antibacterial agent that inhibits
growth of an isolate. The minimum bactericidal
concentration (MBC) is the highest dilution of a drug that
can kill a particular bacterium (Fig. 12.5). In contrast,
MICs can be determined directly using an E-test strip. In
this approach the MIC is determined directly at the point
428
of intersection between the strip and the ellipse of the zone
of inhibition (Fig. 12.6)

lawn   of  bacteria  on  Mueller-Hinton-based   medium.
Following the application of antimicrobial discs, the
inoculated plate is incubated at 37°C for 18 hours. The
diameters of the zones of inhibition are measured (mm)
and compared with intermationally accepted measurements
to determine the susceptibility or resistance of the isolate

Quantitativemethods of

are
increasingly used in research and diagnostic laboratories
and are now the preferred methods of susceptibility testing.
Results can be used in conjunction with pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic data to more accurately calculate
drug dosage. In addition, MIC data are more valuable than
qualitative data for monitoring trends in antimicrobial
resistance.
Molecular methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Although phenotypic methods are more commonly used in
diagnostic laboratories for the detection of antimicrobial
resistance, methods involving identification of resistance
genes have been developed. These methods are usually
based on conventional or real-time PCR and can be used to
detect the presence of resistance genes in an organism
isolated from a clinical specimen or even in the clinical
specimen  itself.
The major advantage of molecular
methods is the speed with which results can be achieved,
especially for organisms that are difficult to grow. This
allows the rapid prescription of antibiotics, which are
430
likely to be effective. The disadvantage of these methods is
that the presence of a gene does not necessarily imply its
expression phenotypically and thus inaccurate clinical
information could be generated using such methods. In
addition, if molecular detection of resistance is used
directly on clinical specimens, isolates are not available for
MICtesting

which inhibits growth, is indicated.

Bacterial colonization, tissue invasion and clinical disease
A number of bacterial species can reside in animal hosts.
either as commensals or as potential pathogens. Mammals
are hosts to an enormous number of resident microbes: for
bacteria, a figure that exceeds the total number of host
cells by at least one order of magnitude. The vast majority
of resident bacteria are commensals that have a history of
co-evolution and harmonious co-existence with the host. In
contrast, pathogenic bacteria can interact with host tissues
in ways that result in disease (Fig. 13.1).
Commensals
Commensal organisms, acquired soon after birth, are able
to adhere to body surfaces. They form stable polymicrobial
communities that are present throughout life as ‘normal
surfaces and cavities are open to the environment. The
composition of the microbial communities tends to be
host-specific and, within hosts, to be organ-specific. In any
particular niche, the proportional representation of the
several species is controlled by competition for nutrients
and for adhesion sites and by antibacterial products such as
bacteriocins released by some members of that microbial
community.
A stable microflora is beneficial to the host in many ways.
The digestive system relies on the normal microflora to
436
degrade ingested material in the rumen of cattle and sheep,
in the caecum and colon of horses, and in the colon of
pigs. The microflora of the rumen synthesizes vitamin K
and some of the vitamin B group, as does the microflora of
the intestine in non-ruminants. The normal microflora
primes the immune system, facilitating a more efficient
host response to challenge by bacterial pathogens. It is
suggested that the
immune
systemisstimulated
non-specifically   by   antigens   associated    with   some
commensals (Tannock, 1995). Germfree animals, which
are denied this stimulation, have poorly developed
secondary lymphoid organs, weak cell-mediated immune
responses and lower serum immunoglobulin levels than
conventional animals. However, it is believed that the most
important beneficial effect of the indigenous microflora is
to provide competition for exogenous bacteria attempting
        
resident flora for nutrients and for receptors.
When the community of commensals occupying a
particular niche is in ecological balance, the bacteria utilize
the resources they require from the host without causing
any obvious adverse effects. However, when that
equilibrium is disturbed or when the host is under severe
stress, an indigenous member may escape from the
restraining influences of the bacterial community and act
as an opportunistic pathogen. This can occur in the
gastrointestinal tract following the administration of oral
antibiotics. Furthermore, bacteria that are harmless in their
usual ecological niche can cause disease in another site: for
instance,Fusobacterium necrophorum can exist as a
commensal in the rumen but when it transfers to the liver
437
of feedlot cattle it can act as a pathogen that causes hepatic
abscesses.

Pathogens
For a microbe to act as a pathogen, it must find an
appropriate niche within a host, it must compete with the
438
normal microflora to gain a foothold in that niche, it must
evade or overcome normal host defences, and it must
express the genes that encode the factors that cause
disease. The ability of a microbe to damage a host is called
pathogenicity; the relative capacity of a pathogen to
damage a host is the degree of virulence. The bacterial
traits that confer pathogenicity are called virulence factors;
these include adhesins, toxins and capsules. The genes for
these virulence factors are not expressed constitutively; the
metabolic economy of
the bacterium dictates that, generally, genes are expressed
which bacteria can switch on or switch off the expression
of a gene product is called phase variation, an extremely
important attribute of pathogenic bacteria
During the course of its existence, a pathogenic bacterium
may be called upon to adapt to a wide variety of changing
environmental conditions, whether in the target host, in the
external environment or, perhaps, in an incidental host.
The survival of the bacterium depends on its ability to
changes in the expression of subsets of its genes. Even
after it encounters a host, the fate of the bacterium is
dependent on the facility to up-regulate or down-regulate
the expression of different gene products, particularly
those recognized as virulence factors. For instance, when a
pathogen enters a host, it must express specific gene
products that enable it to persist and proliferate in an
appropriate location. Later, the gene products that have
linked the bacterium to a particular niche within the host
may have to be down-regulated in favour of products of
other genes that enable the pathogen to move to a new
439
location. As a general rule, gene products that confer an
advantage in a particular environment are expressed, while
 n   n d  s   
environment are not expressed. Switching off the
expression of unwanted gene products saves metabolic
energy; it also reduces the risk of the host mounting an
effective immune response against a virulence factor that
the pathogen may require later. During the course of an
infection, phase variation regulates the expression
1of
virulence factors in response to signals generated by
interactions between host and pathogen. Some virulence
factors are also subject to random phase variation that
produces bacterial populations in which some members
express a particular component and other members do not
express it. This random phase  variation continuously
generates subpopulations of diverse phenotypes. The
subpopulation best adapted to the prevailing conditions
persists
Genes encoding virulence factors are not uniformly
distributed among all the strains of a particular bacterium,
as is evident in several bacterial species in which the
population structure is clonal. In nature, a bacterial species
may exist as a number of discrete genetic lineages, each
represented by a clone of cells descended from a distinct
ancestral cell. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and
several Salmonella species are recognized as highly clonal
organisms,  whereas  Pseudomonas

considered nonclonal. Within a given clonal species, the
members of a clone are likely to carry the same
determinants of virulence. Some lineages are inherently
more virulent than others. It is recognized that most of the
diseases caused by a given pathogen are due to a small
440
proportion of the total number of clones of that pathogen.
The fact that a large proportion of the several diseases
caused by S. aureus infections are caused by a limited
number of clones implies that clones can differ greatly in
relative virulence: some clones can remain as commensals
for extended periods; other clones promptly cause
devastating disease. A degree of tissue tropism is evident
in the relative frequency with which some pathogenic
clones cause certain clinical diseases, a trend that has been
different environmental conditions; for instance, there is
evidence that a limited number of clones of S. aureus are
responsible for many cases of bovine mastitis and that
some of these clones are implicated in disease production
in Ireland and in the USA (Fitzgerald et al., 1997).
Many of the genes that encode virulence factors are
associated with mobile genetic elements: bacteriophages,
plasmids and pathogenicity islands. Pathogenicity islands
occupy relatively large regions of the bacterial genome.
They encode clusters of virulence genes which appear to
have been acquired during evolution by horizontal transfer.

pathogen. Virtually any of the entire spectrum of bacterial
virulence factors - adhesins, invasion factors, secretion
systems and toxins - can be encoded in a pathogenicity
island. However, a cluster of virulence genes that is
441
on a virulence plasmid in another pathogen. Although
pathogenicity islands have been recorded for a wide range
of pathogens, they have not been found in Mycobacterium
or Chlamydia species, in spirochaetes or in most
streptococci.  It has been observed  that pathogenicity
islands appear to extend the range of habitats that can be
colonized by a given bacterial species (Schmidt and
Hensel, 2004).
The interplay of genetic factors involved in any infectious
disease is part of a continuing dynamic process in which
pathogens and hosts have evolutionary effects on one
another: over time, genetic variation in a pathogen is
matched by appropriate adaptive change by its host, and
vice versa. In this process, many different combinations of
microbial   genotype and  host   genotype  occur 
1m
evolutionary
time, generating corresponding changes in virulence.
Rather than being a set characteristic of a given pathogen,
virulence is variable, a product of responses that are
host and are modulated by the environmental conditions
prevailing in the host at that particular time. Although the
proximal determining influence, genetic or environmental,
can
 intensify  the   damage
insome pathogen-host
encounters, nevertheless, in general, co-evolution has
fostered a drift towards a more benign outcome in all but a
minority of microbial infections.
Colonization and growth
Animals may be exposed to infection from endogenous or
exogenous sources. Endogenous infections arise when
442
bacteria that live on the skin or mucous membranes as
harmless  commensals  take advantage  of  impaired
antimicrobial defences of the host and behave as
opportunistic pathogens. This is likely to happen when
epithelial barriers are damaged, when immunity is
weakened by drugs, radiation or exogenous pathogens.
when the ecological balance of the resident microbial
community is disturbed by administration of antibiotics, or
when the bacteria gain access to sites from which they are
usually absent.
Exogenous infections
6 occur after direct or indirect
transmission from an infected animal or from the
environment. The route of infection determines the site of
the initial interaction between pathogen and host and also
the organs at greatest risk of infection. Subsequent
interactions are driven by microbial genes that express
virulence factors and by host genes that are responsible for
resistance to pathogens. Although pathogens may enter a
host through the skin, the conjunctiva, the umbilicus, or
the teat canal, the main portals of entry are the mucosae of
the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urogenital tracts. To a
large extent, those surfaces are lined by polar epithelial
cells linked on adjacent lateral cell membranes by tight
free surface of the epithelium. The tightness of the barrier
varies in different locations, from “leaky’ epithelium in the
intestines, where the intercellular junctions are permeable
to small molecules, to ^tight' epithelium in segments of the
nephron, where the intercellular junctions allow virtually
       
adjacent cells. Thus, the layer of epithelial cells provides a
mechanical barrier that serves to protect the underlying
443
tissues from invasion by bacteria. The epithelial cells
secrete fluids such as mucus in which bacteria can be
'recognize' pathogens, activate the innate  immune
response, and secrete antibacterial peptides and proteins.
Microbes that seek to colonize a niche must attach
promptly to intact epithelial cells or to components of the
exposed subepithelial extracellular matrix, such as
collagen, elastin, fibronectin and laminin. Non-specific
attachment can occur as a consequence of electrostatic or
hydrophobic forces; specific attachment is achieved by
ligand-receptor binding. Typically, the ligand is a protein,
an adhesin, on the bacterial cell surface and the receptor is
a specific carbohydrate moiety in a glycoprotein or
glycolipid constituent of the host cell. Some adhesins are
anchored within the bacterial cell membrane (afimbrial or
nonfimbrial adhesins), others are present in fimbriae (or
pili), filamentous structures that project from the cell
number of different adhesins but it does not always express
them: expression of each of the genes may be subject to
phase variation. Phase variation of adhesins gives a
bacterium the opportunity to ^slip anchor’ from a primary
site of attachment, after which it may use a different
adhesin to attach to another location within the host or it
may be shed to the exterior, contaminating the
environment or transferring to a new host. As surface
       
for protective antibodies, pathogens may use phase
variation as a mechanism for immune evasion.
444
Once bacteria bind to host cell receptors they must
replicate to colonize the site and to avoid total elimination
when the host cells are desquamated. The new arrivals
compete with the indigenous microflora for nutrients.
Availability of iron is a limiting factor for the growth of
bacteria. Iron, as a component of the cytochromes and the
iron-sulphur proteins involved in electron transport, plays
a major role in bacterial respiration. Most iron in the
animal body is unavailable to bacteria because it is bound
by iron-binding proteins such as lactoferrin and transferrin.
However, many pathogenic bacteria have evolved
mechanisms for obtaining iron from their hosts. These
include the production of iron-chelating compounds
(siderophores) which can remove iron from transferrin and
lactoferrin. Some bacteria can bind iron from these
molecules in the absence of siderophores; other bacteria
can lyse erythrocytes to obtain iron from haemoglobin
       
ability of bacteria to infect the host, iron- uptake systems
can be considered as virulence factors. If the supply of
nutrients is adequate and the environmental conditions are
favourable, the newly acquired bacteria replicate.
Replication can lead to one of three outcomes: a transient
benign colonization; a permanent benign colonization that
does not appear to induce any significant changes in either
thebacteria
or the host; or an infectious process that damages the host
Bacteria that succeed in establishing a presence in an
anatomical niche tend to create a biofilm on the epithelial
surface. In the early phase of colonization, the bacteria
secrete a polysaccharide matrix in which the bacterial cells
are incorporated. The sticky extracellular polysaccharide
445
shields the bacteria from the defence mechanisms of the
host and from antimicrobial drugs. Bacteria can adopt the
biofilm mode of growth under a variety of different
circumstances: for instance, in dental plaque and on
indwelling medical devices in humans, in infections of the
urinary tract and of the female genital tract in animals and
in humans, and in air conditioning systems where
Legionella species may be present in biofilms. Many of the
bacteria in a biofilm produce small signal molecules
(pheromones, formerly called auto-inducers) by which
they communicate
e with other bacterial cells of other
species as well as of the same species. As the bacteria
proliferate, the pheromones accumulate within the biofilm.
When the population reaches a defined density (a bacterial
quorum), the pheromones attain a critical threshold
concentration at which they coordinate the expression of
bacterial genes so that the colonizing bacteria act as a
community rather than as individuals. This process of
quorum sensing is a feature of colonization by bacteria
such as Staphylococcus aureus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
S.epidermidis, E. coli and Streptococcus species. The
genes expressed by bacteria in the biofilm may be
significantly different from those expressed by the
colonizing bacteria from which the biofilm has been
derived.Bacterial
pathogens
regulate
virulence
determinants to ensure that they are expressed only at the
appropriate stage of infection. Quorum-sensing pathogens
do not waste energy expressing virulence determinants
when they are not required; rather, expression is delayed
so that recognition by the adaptive immune system of the
host is avoided until the bacterial cell population has
reached a critical mass that has the capacity to effectively
challenge the defences of the host.
446
Pathogen- host interactions
In bacterial infections, the host may be damaged by
bacterial toxins, by the inflammatory response elicited by
the bacteria or their toxins or, commonly, by both toxins
and inflammatory reactions. The immune responses of the
host may also be a source of tissue damage. This is a
feature of the pathogenesis of the chronic inflammatory
reactions associated with mycobacterial infections which
    s     g
clinically silent infection to fulminating lethal disease.
This variability is determined by the virulence of the
bacteria and by the effectiveness of the host response. To a
considerable degree, the virulence expressed by a pathogen
is pertinent to its immediate needs, principally to survive
in a particular niche, to propagate its genes and to
disseminate those genes to new hosts. Therefore, in
general, it is in the interest of the bacterium to take the
resources it requires
Sfrom the host without being
excessively destructive.
Virulence factors
Pathogenic bacteria have evolved many virulence factors
which enable them to colonize extracellular or intracellular
niches in mammalian hosts. Pathogens that are able to
survive within host cells are grouped into two categories:
strict (obligate) intracellular pathogens and facultative
intracellular pathogens. Chlamydiae and rickettsiae are
obligate intracellular pathogens. Among the facultative
intracellular pathogens, Mycobacterium species enter and
replicate in phagocytic cells, while Brucella species.
447
uropathogenic E. coli, Salmonella species, and Listeria
monocytogenes invade and replicate  in non-phagocytic
epithelial cells. A wide range of virulence factors is
required by pathogens to colonize these diverse niches
The major virulence factors are adhesins, capsules and
toxins.
Adhesins
Pathogens use adhesins to attach to host tissues and to
resist the flushing action of body fluids; thus, adhesins
play a significant role throughout the course of an
infection. The expression of adhesins is subject to phase
variation in response to local conditions. Many pathogens
express several different adhesins, each of which may
recognize host cell receptors on different cell types or on
the same cell type in different locations. For instance, type
1 fimbriae of uropathogenic E. coli attach to the epithelial
cells of the urinary bladder, while P fimbriae of the same
bacteria   attach  to
epithelial cells in the kidney.
Colonization of a preferred niche may require several
adhesins rather than a single adhesin. This is typical of
colonization of the intestine by enteropathogenic bacteria.
including Salmonella species. Interaction of adhesins with
cell receptors activates signal transduction pathways, cell
signalling cascades that can alter cell behaviour through
changes in gene transcription, in cell metabolism, or in the
cytoskeleton of the host cell. Adhesin-receptor interaction
of enteropathogens with intestinal epithelium results in
activation of signalling pathways that
generate the release of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB), a
transcription factor that moves to the cell nucleus where it
up-regulates

such as Listeria monocytogenes, high-affinity interaction
of their adhesins with host cell receptors activates signal
transduction pathways that mediate the uptake of the
bacteria by non-phagocytic epithelial cells.
Capsules
d  r    
Capsules interfere with opsonization, the binding of
complement and antibody to the bacterial surface, thus
protecting the bacterium from engulfment by phagocytes
and from attack by antimicrobial agents. During growth.
encapsulated bacteria may stick together, forming a
microcolony or a biofilm that is resistant to phagocytic
cells because of its large size. Some bacteria have capsules
that may attach to host tissues. Many capsules are
composed of polysaccharides and are hydrophilic; thus.
these capsules may help the bacterium to resist desiccation.
The capsule of Bacillus anthracis is composed of
polyglutamic acid; it is anti-phagocytic and is regarded as
an essential virulence factor.
Toxins
Traditionally, bacterial toxins have been considered to be
of two types: exotoxins, produced and secreted by viable
bacteria, and endotoxins, integral constituents of the
bacterial cell wall not released until the microorganisms
are lysed. Bacterial exotoxins and endotoxins differ in their
structures and modes of action (Table 13.1)
449
Endotoxin is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the outer
leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It
is composed of three parts: a hydrophobic glycolipid (lipid
A) and a hydrophilic polysaccharide composed of a core
oligosaccharide and an  O-polysaccharide (O antigen).
Toxicity resides in the lipid A portion. Lipopolysaccharide
is released when bacterial cell walls are damaged by the
complement system, phagocytes or antimicrobial drugs.
The in vivo effects of endotoxin (BOX 13.1) depend on the
amount present in the circulation. Small quantities of LPS
enter the bloodstream every day, largely as a consequence
of the death of commensal Gram-negative bacteria in the
intestinal tract. LPs interacts with cells that have the
toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4): mononuclear phagocytes,
neutrophils, platelets, dendritic cells and B lymphocytes.
In this way, the innate immune system continues to be
primed by the commensal microflora. High concentrations
of circulating endotoxin greatly increase the release of
cytokines, notably interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-α)
from
1arangeofmononuclear
phagocytes, including Kupffer cells, monocytes, and
macrophages in the spleen, bone marrow and pulmonary
alveoli. Released
cytokines induce  fever,  activate
macrophages and clotting factor XII, and stimulate B cells
to divide and produce antibodies. Cytokines stimulate the
production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes which are
mediators of inflammation. When present in toxic
concentrations, LPs is responsible for the deposition of
thrombi in small  vessels (disseminated intravascular
coagulation) and for a dramatic drop in blood pressure,
giving rise to life-threatening endotoxic shock.

Exotoxins can be produced by either Gram-positive or
Gram-negative bacteria. The toxins are highly antigenic
proteins that can induce the production of protective
antitoxins. Occasionally, a potent exotoxin, such as
Clostridium botulinum toxin, is ingested in contaminated
food and produces systemic effects. More commonly,
exotoxins are produced within the host and they may exert
their effects either locally or systemically (BOX 13.2)
451

·Cell membrane damage
- Enzymatic digestion
- Formation of pores
· Inter ference with protein synthesis
- Elevation of cAMP levels
- Disruption of functions relating to nervous tissue
· Digestion of components of interstitial tissue:
collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid
Many exotoxins have a two-subunit structure comprising
an A subunit that possesses toxic enzymatic activity and a
B subunit that is responsible for binding the exotoxin to
specific receptors on the host cell membrane and may help
in the transfer of the B subunit across the cell membrane.
The enzymatic component, which acts on intracellular
targets, does not become active until it is released in the
cell. Thus, the B subunit determines the host cell
specificity of the toxin: if the cell does not have receptors
for the B subunit, it is not vulnerable to the toxin. Both
tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin have the A-B subunit
structure.
The exotoxins can be grouped into four major categories:
(i) toxins that act on the extracellular matrix; (ii) toxins
that act on the plasma membrane of their target cells.
pathways or alter membrane permeability; (iii) toxins that
act inside the cells, where they modify signalling pathways
452
or the activities of the cytoskeleton; and (iv) toxins that
cause dysfunction of the immune system, so-called
superantigens. Some exotoxins damage the mucosal
surface by enzymatic degradation of the epithelial cells,
the intercellular junctions and the underlying tissues, thus
removing physical barriers and facilitating the spread of
bacteria through the tissues. Bacterial hyaluronidases,
collagenases, lecithinases, elastases and phospholipases
have the ability to degrade cell membranes and the tissue
matrix.
At sublethal concentrations many of the membrane-acting
toxins induce elevated concentrations of intracellular
messengers, such as cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP and free
cytosolic calcium ions. Because these messengers are
involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, even
sublytic amounts of the exotoxins are capable of
interfering with

generating a signal that induces a significant rise in cyclic
GMP within the cell. The resultant disturbance in the
signals, an exotoxin can up-regulate the expression of
inducible genes that are responsible for the secretion of
pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-8. Some
physiologically  important   cellular  activities can be
disturbed or turned off by an exotoxin that blocks the
synthesis of intracellular proteins; this may result in the
death of the target cells. Thus, both the cytolytic and
non-cytolytic activities of an exotoxin can contribute to the
local and systemic manifestations of a bacterial infection.
453
A number of toxins induce pore formation in cell
membranes that disrupt the selective influx and efflux of
jons across the membranes. For instance, uropathogenic E.
coli release a-haemolysin which is cytotoxic to a variety of
cells including erythrocytes, leukocytes, endothelial cells,
fibroblasts and uroepithelial cells. It forms transmembrane
pores that allow the loss of the normal ionic gradients
without the loss of intracellular proteins; as a result, the
intermal macromolecules draw water into the cell, which 1s
killed by osmotic lysis.  At sublethal levels, the
α-haemolysin of uropathogenic E. coli is a potent stimulus
for the release of interleukin- 1β (IL-1β), which induces
fever and triggers the release of acute phase proteins. The
membrane-damaging group of toxins also includes the
pore-forming haemolysins of Streptococcus pyogenes,
Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. At
sublytic concentrations, pore-forming toxins can impair the
defensive activities of the host: they inhibit or abolish
induce apoptosis of T lymphocytes. Pore-forming toxins
are synthesized and released when bacteria require iron;
lysis of erythrocytes by the toxins releases haemoglobin.

extracellular fluid (ECF), or it may be delivered directly
into the cytosol of the target cell. If a toxin enters the ECF.
the host can respond by producing neutralizing antibodies.
Many bacterial toxins that act in the intracellular
compartment are released into the ECF, attach to the
plasma membrane and gain entry to the cell in a
membrane-bound
vesicle.In
contrast,  several
Gram-negative pathogens, such as Salmonella species,
454
Shigella species, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC),
enterohaem- orrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, deliver toxins directly into the cytosol of the
target cell. The pathogens use a specialized system, a
molecular syringe called a type III secretory system, to
export the toxins in a hollow conduit across the inner
bacterial membrane, the outer bacterial membrane, and the
plasma membrane of the host cell. Because the exported
toxins do not enter the extracellular spaces, the host does
not develop neutralizing antibodies
against them. Within the target cells, the exported proteins,
known as ^effectors', interfere with signal trans- duction or
act on the cytoskeleton. Effectors exported by Salmonella
species and by Shigella species act on the cytoskeleton and
are responsible for the uptake of the pathogens by
non-phagocytic host epithelial cells. EPEC are also
responsible for rearrangements of the cytoskeleton but, in
contrast, the bacterium remains outside the cell. Moreover,
EPEC supply both the ligand and the receptor that bring
the bacterium into intimate contact with the host cell. The
bacterial adhesin is an outer membrane protein, intimin.
The receptor is a bacterial protein, Tir (translated intimin
receptor), that is incorporated into the plasma membrane of
the host epithelial cell after it has been transferred by an
    se s   i
Tir leads to rearrangement of cytoskeletal components
forming actin pedestals to which the EPEC attach.
Another family of microbial exotoxins, the superantigens
(Fig. 13.2), subvert the adaptive immune response by
cross-linking
two
of
the
most
important
antigen-recognition molecules, the T cell receptor (TCR)
and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class HI
455
molecule. The superantigens bind first to MHC class HI
molecules on the surface of antigen- presenting cells
(APC) but not in the antigen-binding groove. Then, the
bimolecular superantigen-MHC protein complex interacts
with subsets of the variable region of the β chain of the T
cell receptor (TCR VB). The cross-linking of the two cell
types results in a massive proliferation of T cells bearing
particular segments of TCR Vβ and an associated release
oflargequantities
 of cytokines  that  can cause
inflammation, fever, shock and multiple-organ system
failure. A given superantigen can activate virtually all T
cells that carry the subsets of the β chain with which it
engages when it cross-links MHC with TCR. In contrast, a
conventional antigen elicits a cellular response from only
those T cells that have the appropriate receptor, a relatively
small proportion of the T cell population. Hence, the T cell
conventional antigen by several orders of magnitude.
However, because activation depends on the variable
region of the β chain rather than on the antigenic
specificity of the TCR, it does not provide the host with
immune protection against the pathogen that released the
superantigen. In the course of some diseases, the initial
proliferation is followed by failure of T cells to respond to
the superantigen (T cell anergy) or by apoptosis and
specific deletion of the particular TCR Vβ-bearing cells
This may increase the susceptibility of the host to
infection. When a superantigen establishes a nonspecific
linkage of TCR Vβ to MHC class II, the activated cells
release large quantities of cytokines: principally, IL-2.

Responses of the host to bacterial pathogens
The principal challenge for the host is to detect the
pathogen and mount a rapid defensive response before
there is significant tissue injury or interference with
immune system to mount a full response, an interval
during which the host may experience severe injury or
even death. Therefore, the ability of the innate immune
crucial. The cells of the innate immune system express
various patterm-recognition receptors (PRRs) capable of
detecting conserved molecular ^patterns’ that are unique to
microorganisms and are not expressed by the hosts.
Although these microbial ‘patterns’ are present in
commensals and pathogens alike, they are known as
pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In fact,
it is molecules - specific, individual molecules - rather
       
instances (Beutler, 2004). Recognized ligands include
LPS, lipoprotein, peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid and
DNA from bacteria, double-stranded RNA from viruses,
and glucans from fungi. These ligands are indispensable
components of the microorganisms and, for that reason,
they are not readily altered by mutation or selection
(Beutler, 2004).

Mammals possess a family of transmembrane PRRs, called
toll-like receptors (TLRs), that are expressed constitutively
in a variety of host immune cells, such as macrophages,
dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, B cells, and specific
types of T cells. They are expressed also in some
non-immune cells, such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells
and fibroblasts. To date, 12 members of the family have
been identified in mammals. Many of the TLRs are located
in cell membranes but some are found almost exclusively
within the cell. In addition, two intracellular proteins with
nucleotide oligomerization domains (NOD) are known to
act as sensors of pathogens in the cytoplasm of infected
cells. Thus, the innate immune system is equipped to
 s    s
extracellular or intracellular. Each TLR confers the ability
to recognize distinct structural components, whether
458
expressed by bacteria, viruses, protozoa, or fungi. For
instance, TRL-4 in the host cell membrane recognizes LPS
of Gram-negative bacteria; TRL-2 recognizes a discrete set
of ligands, including lipoproteins and peptidoglycan of
Gram-positive bacteria; while TLR-9, located within the
host cell, detects nucleic acids derived from viruses and
bacteria.
Recognition of PAMPs by TLRs activates intracellular
signalling pathways that culminate in translocation of the
transcription factor NF-kB to the nucleus where it binds to
DNA and mediates the expression of the genes responsible
for various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α,
IFN-y, IL-6, IL-1B, and IL-12. The effector molecules and
cells involved in the resultant inflammatory response
include complement, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic
cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells. The neutrophils
capable of killing most pathogens. Macrophages secrete
chemokines that attract neutrophils to the site of infection
and they present microbial antigens to T cells. Signals
from the TLRs also help to initiate pathogen-specific
adaptive immune responses through the activation of
dendritic cells. Some activated dendritic cells migrate from
the site of infection to draining lymph nodes; there, in
co-operation with MHC class II molecules, they present
the microbial antigens to naive CD 4+ T cells and promote
differentiation into T helper cells. In many instances, the
process leads to the elimination of the pathogen without
any clinical evidence of inflammation. However, when the
outcome is less satisfactory, the inflammatory response
can become an integral part of a pathological process
459
Because the pathogen-recognition receptors are expressed
constitutivelyand
1  the   pathogen-associated   molecular
patterns are conserved, the innate immune system is
competent to detect microorganisms at all stages of their
life histories. TRLs detect the molecular signatures of
microbial pathogens, they orchestrate the innate immune
responses, and they help to initiate the adaptive immune
response. The efficacy of the adaptive immune response is
built on the antigen-presenting function of the innate
immune cells and on the actions of cytokines produced by
cells of the innate immune system (Beutler, 2004)
The contest between host and pathogen does not always
result in a clear victory for one or the other. Sometimes,
pathogenic bacteria, endowed with an extensive set of
virulence genes, reside within a host for an extended
enteric pathogen, such as Salmonella Dublin in cattle or S.
Typhi in humans, is sequestered in the gall bladder or in
lymph nodes and is not excreted in the faeces, the host is
described as a latent carrier; if the pathogen is shed in
faeces, either continuously or intermittently, the host is
considered an active carrier. In stressful situations, latent
carriers can become active carriers, asymptomatic hosts
susceptible animals. The most notorious active carrier
recorded in history has been the healthy cook, ^Typhoid
Mary', who worked in New York State in the early years
of the twentieth century and infected over 200 people with
Salmonella Typhi as she moved from one employer to
another. In cattle herds, Salmonella Dublin can establish
long-term residence in both latent carriers and active
carriers. Although the tendency towards ‘restrained
460
virulence’ is common amongst pathogens, there are
exceptions.Living
g hosts are not essential for the
dissemination  of  spore-forming  anaerobes  such  as
Clostridium species. These bacteria produce highly lethal
toxins that kill the host, which then becomes an
anaerobic substrate in which the bacteria multiply and
from which they can be disseminated as spores.
Dissemination of pathogens in the host
Some pathogens are not invasive and do not spread
systemically, yet they release toxins and other signals that
pose challenges to homeostasis, local or systemic. For
instance, when enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli
(ETEC) adhere to the epithelial cells of the small intestine
in newborn farm animals, they are not invasive but they
induce profuse quantities of watery diarrhoea in the
absence of evident histological damage to the mucosa.
Likewise, Clostridium tetani can contaminate a wound in
any region of the body, producing a neurotoxin. The
pathogen remains in situ but the toxin causes systemic
effects after it is taken up by peripheral nerve endings and
transported intra-axonally to the central nervous system
where it blocks the actions of inhibitory motor neurons. In
contrast, other pathogenic bacteria penetrate epithelial
barriers, gain access to the underlying tissue and induce
inflammatory changes. For  instance,  Pseudomonas
aeruginosa secretes a number of toxins that degrade the
epithelial barrier and allow the opportunistic pathogen to
enter the subepithelial tissues.
        
breach the epithelial barrier: by passage through the
461
intercellular spaces (the paracellular route), or by passage
through the epithelial cells (the transcellular route). Some
pathogensarecapable

paracellular route can be taken by bacteria that are able to
disrupt the intercellular tight junctions: for example.

，Listeria
Imonocytogenes,
Helicobacter pylori, some Clostridium species and some
Salmonella serovars. Other bacteria, such as Shigella
species, may pass through the paracellular route when tight
to chemotactic stimuli from pathogens present on the
epithelial surface
If it is to negotiate the transcellular route, an invasive
bacterium must be able to enter intact epithelial cells.
Epithelial cells are not phagocytic, so invasive bacteria
have had to evolve molecular strategies that enable them to
regulate their own entry
into these host cells. The
pathogens
enter
the
epithelial
cells
 through
membrane-bound vacuoles
 formed
1by the host cell
membrane  in  response  to  signals
generatedbythe
pathogens. There are two major types of induced uptake: a
zipper? mechanism and a ‘trigger? mechanism. The zipper
mechanism   is   induced
bv
specific  ligand-receptor
interactions at the cell membrane, whereas the trigger
mechanism is induced by effector molecules delivered into
the cell by a type III secretory system. In each instance, the
pathogens utilize existing signal  transduction pathways
within the cells to promote rearrangements of the actin
cytoskeleton beneath the host cell membrane. The actin is
responsible for the cell membrane forming pseudopodia or
larger membrane ruffles that progress to envelop the
pathogens in vacuoles, which are then taken into the host
462
cell. The actin cytoskeleton provides the energy necessary
for the formation of the vacuoles and for the entry of the
vacuoles into the cell.
For pathogens that use the zipper mechanism, activation of
the signalling pathways begins when bacterial ligands bind
with high affinity to specific receptors on the epithelial cell
membrane, as when internalins on the surface of Listeria
monocytogenes bind to E-cadherin on the apical surface of
the host cell, or when invasins on the surface of Yersinid
pseudotuberculosis bind to βi-integrins on the basolateral
side of the host cell. For both pathogens, the actin
cytoskeleton accumulates in the vicinity of the point of
host-pathogen contact and the formation of the membrane-
bound vacuole is achieved by incremental interactions
between bacterial ligands and cell adhesins, resulting in a
zipper-like process which tightly envelops the bacterium
(Fig. 13.3).
Bacteria that use the trigger mechanism, including
Salmonella and Shigella, deliver effector proteins that
induce a profuse rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton
under the host plasma membrane, which results in the
membrane extending into large ruffles that fold over, fuse
and trap the pathogens and extracellular material in a
membrane-bound,  fluid-filled  compartment 
  that  is
incorporated into the cell. Thus, Salmonella and Shigella
enter  epithelial   cells  in   spacious  macropinocytotic
vacuoles (Fig. 13.4).

complexes. This leads to clustering of receptors and local
[      
(zipper-like) ligand-receptor binding around the bacterium
until the invading pathogen is enclosed within a vacuole
that appears to sink into the cell. Listeria species are taken
in through the apical surface of the epithelial cell and
Yersinia species enter through the basolateral surface of
the host cell.

The site of entry is subject to the polarity of the host cells.
Tight junctions divide the epithelial plasma membrane into
two surfaces: the apical surface and the basolateral surface.
These two surfaces have different functions and distinctly
different biochemical components, including receptors,
pumps,
channels, transporters,
lipids, proteins and
enzymes.
Some invasive
bacteria,  such  as Listeria
monocytogenes and Salmonella species, attach to epitopes
present in protein and glycolipid constituents of the apical
surface before they are engulfed by the polarized epithelial
cells. However, Yersinia species and Shigella species, also
invasive bacteria, are not able to bind to the apical surfaces
of the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa but they
enter these cells through the basolateral membranes. The
pathogens are taken up by M cells, specialized epithelial
cells that overlie Peyer's patches. When they reach the cell
pockets beneath the M cells, they are engulfed by the
resident macrophages in which they multiply and induce
rapid cell death. On release from the dead macrophages,
the bacteria induce ruffling of the basolateral membranes
of adjoining columnar epithelial cells, which leads to those
cells engulfing the bacteria in membrane-bound vacuoles.
465
Once inside epithelial cells, Listeria and Shigella are able
to lyse the vacuolar membrane and escape into the
cytoplasm.  Listeria monocytogenes escapes because it
secretes a pore-forming enzyme, listeriolysin O. While free
in the cytoplasm, both Listeria and Shigella polymerize
actin filaments forming a comet-like tail at one bacterial
pole which propels them towards adjacent cells. The
energy for the movement of the bacteria is provided by the
host cell. When the motile bacteria reach the lateral cell
membrane, they induce pseudopod-like projections. These
projections and the bacteria they contain are engulfed by
the adjacent cells. In the newly infected cells, the bacteria
lyse the membranes surrounding them and the cycle is
repeated allowing extensive cell-to-cell transmission and
causing significant damage within the epithelial layer. In
contrast, Salmonella are able to remain within the spacious
vacuoles in which they enter the host cells. The persistence
of the microorganisms in these novel intracellular
compartments is attributed to a number of effector proteins
they deliver into the host cell cytoplasm by the type IHI
secretory system (Coburn et al., 2007).
Bacteria that gain access to the bloodstream can be
disseminated throughout the body either free in the plasma
or in phagocytes. During bacteraemia, bacteria are present
whereas, during septicaemia, pathogenic organisms
multiply and persist in the bloodstream, producing
systemic disease. Dissemination of Mycobacterium bovis
throughout the body can occur following phagocytosis by
macrophages.
The clinical spectrum of bacterial disease
466
Disease is not an inevitable consequence of infection.
Some individual pathogens tend to produce a predictable
clinical picture following infection of a susceptible host.
Anthrax in ruminants is invariably peracute and fatal. In
contrast, infections with bacteria such as Salmonella
Dublin in cattle may produce many different forms of
disease.
Bacterial infections can be conveniently categorized as
acute, subacute, chronic or persistent. Acute infections
usually have a short severe clinical course, often a matter
of days, and the invading bacteria are usually cleared from
the body by the host's immune response. The host may
shed the agent in large numbers for a short period
Subacute infections produce clinical effects of less
intensity.
Chronic infections tend to occur when the host fails to
eliminate the pathogen. Frequently, the infectious agent
replicates initially to a high level and is subsequently
cleared from most sites in the body by the host's immune
response. Persistence occurs in certain sites such as the
uriniferous tubules and the CNS in which the effects of
cell-mediated and
1   humoral  immunity  are   minimal.
Persistent shedding may occur from some of these sites as
   ss   is  
in urine for more than a year. Some other chronic
infections may be characterized by persistence with or
without shedding of the aetiological agent. Cattle that have
mounted an effective
cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium bovis
infection may remain chronically infected, with the
organism persisting in localized foci without shedding.

Staphylococcus species
Staphylococci are Gram-positive cocci, approximately 1
μm in diameter, that tend to occur in irregular clusters
resembling bunches of grapes (Fig. 14.1). The name
derives from the Greek words staphyle and kokkos for a
bunchof
grapes’
and
Ta
‘berry', respectively.
Staphylococcus species occur as commensals on skin and
mucous membranes; some may act as opportunistic
pathogens causing pyogenic infections.
Most
staphylococci
are
facultative
anaerobes
and
catalase-positive.
They
are
 non-motile
and
oxidase-negative and do not form spores. Two species, S.
aureus subsp. anaerobius and S. saccharolyticus, are
anaerobic and catalase-negative.
Atotalof 43 speciesofStaphylococcushave been
described to date, seven of which are coagulase-positive or
coagulase-variable
species
(Table
14.1).
The
coagulase-positive S. aureus subsp. aureus (referred to as
S. aureus), S. pseudintermedius, and the coagulase-
variable S. hyicus are important pathogens of domestic
animals (Table 14.1). Staphylococcus intermedius was
previously thought to be the major  staphylococcal
pathogen of dogs and cats but it is now considered that S.
intermedius strains isolated from these hosts belong to the
species S. pseudintermedius (Sasaki et al., 2007; Devriese
et al., 2009). Coagulase production correlates with
pathogenicity. Although coagulase- negative staphylococci
470
are usually of low virulence, some occasionally cause
disease in animals and humans (Table 14.2)
Usual habitat
Staphylococcal species occur worldwide as commensals
on the skin of animals and humans. They are also found on
mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract and
lower urogenital tract and as transients in the digestive
tract. The carriage sites of the pathogenic staphylococci are
usually the mucous membranes and moist areas of the skin
such as the axillae or perineal area. The nares are a major
site of carriage of S. aureus in animals and humans, and

carriers of this organism. Staphylococcus sciuri and S.

common
coagulase-negative
staphylococci isolated from healthy domestic animals.
Staphylococci are comparatively stable in the environment,
and staphylococcal strains display a selective affinity for
particular  animal  species.  Transfer   of  staphylococcal
strains between animal species and between animals and
humans is limited but of importance.  Transfer of
methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains from humans to
animals or animals to humans is of particular significance.

· Colonial characteristics: Staphylococcal colonies are usually
white, opaque and up to 4 mm in diameter. The colonies of
bovine and human strains of S. aureus are golden yellow.
Colonies of some coagulase-negative staphylococci are also
pigmented.
Haemolysis in sheep or ox blood agar: Four staphylococcal
haemolysins are recognized, alpha, beta, gamma and delta.
[ndividual haemolysins differ antigenically, biochemically
and in their effects on the red blood cells of different animal
species. Strains vary in their haemolysin-producing ability,
and animal strains of S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius
usually
 produce  both alpha-haemolysin
and
beta-haemolysin. Onruminant
tblood
1agar，the
alpha-haemolysin causes a narrow zone of complete
haemolysis
s immediately around the colony, and the
beta-haemolysin produces a wider zone of partial or
incomplete haemolysis. This is referred to as double
haemolysis (Fig. 14.2). These haemolysins act as toxins in
vivo. Coagulase-negative staphylococci exhibit variation in
their ability to produce haemolysis which usually develops
slowly. [solates of S. hyicus are non-haemolytic.
· Slide and tube coagulase tests: In these tests, a suspension of
staphylococci is mixed with rabbit plasma either on a slide
or in a small tube. The fibrinogen in rabbit plasma is
converted to fibrin by coagulase:
- The slide test detects the presence of a bound coagulase or
clumping factor on the bacterial surface. A positive reaction
is indicated by clumping of bacteria within 1 to 2 minutes.
The tube
test
detects
bothfree
coagulase
(staphylocoagulase), which is secreted by the bacteria into
the plasma, and bound coagulase. It is the definitive test for
coagulase production and a positive reaction is indicated by
clot formation in the tube following incubation at 37°C for
24 hours.
Commercially available kits, which detect capsular
polysaccharides  and  cell  wall  components  including
476
clumping factor and Protein A, are useful for the
presumptive identification of S. aureus.
·Biochemical tests for differentiating S. aureus and S.
pseudintermedius (Table 14.4):
- A rapid test for detection of acetoin has been developed
(Davis and Hoyling, 1973)-
- Purple agar, containing bromocresol purple as a pH
indicator and 1% maltose, can be used to differentiate S.
aureus from S. pseudintermedius and S. intermedius (Quinn
et af., 1994). Staphylococcus aureus utilizes maltose and the
acid produced changes the medium and colonies from purple
toyellow. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and
S
intermedius are poor maltose fermenters and do not change
the colour of the medium. Differentiation of S. intermedius
and S. pseudintermedius can be carried out by bio-chemical
methods including the detection of mannitol fermentation
under  anaerobic  conditions.  However,  definitive
differentiation of these species is most reliable using
molecular methods. As recent molecular studies have shown
that all S. intermedius isolates from dogs belonged to a
single major cluster containing the newly described S.
pseudintermedius (Fitzgerald, 2009), it is likely that all
isolates from dogs that were phenotypically identified as S.
intermedius in the past are in fact S. pseudintermedius
- Biochemical tests, which are commercially available, can
be used to confirm the staphylococcal species, although
those currently available do not differentiate S. intermedius
from S. pseudintermedius.
·Molecular procedures such as the polymerase chain reaction
are increasingly used by diagnostic laboratories as well as
research laboratories    for   definitive  identification   of
staphylococcal species.

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Because staphylococci are pyogenic bacteria, they often
cause
suppurative
lesions.
Minor
trauma
or
immunosuppression may predispose to the development of
infection. As with
many other bacterial pathogens,
virulence attributes can be broadly classified into those
that promote tissue colonization, immune evasion and
tissue destruction. Surface proteins such as staphylococcal
cell
1 wall proteins,
which bind
1 to fibronectin  and
fibrinogen, facilitate bacterial attachment
to
tissues.
 Structural
 features
including
capsular
polysaccharide, teichoic acids and protein A interfere with
opsonization
  and
subsequent
phagocytosis. Catalase
production aids
in survival
1within
phagocytes, and
coagulase has a role in shielding the organism from
phagocytic cells. An array of virulence factors are involved
in spread within tissues and the production of pathological
   a     
relatively  minor   local 
infections
s tolife-threatening
septicaemia. Although the major virulence factors of S.
aureus have been well
1characterized, those
eof S.
pseudintermedius are less defined. Nevertheless, many
virulence attributes of S. pseudintermedius appear similar
to those identified in S.
.aureus (Fitzgerald,  2009)
Exoenzymes such as kinases and hyaluronidase promote
479
tissue invasion, and exotoxins including haemolysins and
leukocidin lyse host cell membranes. Exfoliative toxins
have been identified in all three major staphylococcal
pathogens of domestic animals (S. aureus, S. hyicus and S.
pseudintermedius). These toxins are proteases that act on
desmoglein, a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule in the skin
(Nishifuji et al., 2008). They appear to act mainly in a
species-specific
manner  as the predominant toxin
produced in human staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
failed to produce lesions in pigs or dogs. Virulence factors
of S. aureus and their pathogenic effects are indicated in
Table 14.5. Genes encoding virulence factors in S. aureus
are usually found on mobile genetic elements such as S.
aureus   pathogenicity    islands    and    bacteriophages.
Regulatory genes such as agr and sarA control the
expression of  virulence  genes  as  infection  proceeds
(O'Neill et al., 2007).
Production of coagulase by staphylococci is an important
indicator    of  pathogenicity.   Additional  markers   for
pathogenicity are DNase activity and protein A production
Biofilm formation by S. aureus, S epidermidis and S.
pseudintermedius is a significant virulence determinant
and these species are capable of causing chronic
prosthetic-device-related infections.
Enterotoxins produced by S. aureus are important causes
of food poisoning in humans. S. pseudintermedius is also
known to produce some similar toxins but the role of these
toxins in food poisoning is not well defined.
Diagnostic procedures
480
· Exudative epidermitis in piglets and tick pyaemia of lambs
are the only clinical conditions of domestic animals with
clinical signs sufficiently distinctive to indicate the
involvement  of pathogenic  staphylococci. In suppurative
conditions, the likelihood of staphylococcal infection must
be considered and appropriate specimens such as exudates
and mastitic milk collected for laboratory procedures.
·Gram-stained smears of pus or other suitable specimens may
reveal typical staphylococcal clusters.
· Specimens are cultured on blood agar, selective blood agar
and MacConkey agar and incubated aerobically at 37°C for
24 to 48 hours. Selective blood agar, which contains
nalidixic acid and colistin, is used to inhibit Proteus species
and other Gram-negative contaminants.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
- Colonial characteristics
 Presence or absence of haemolysis
- Absence of growth on MacConkey agar
- Catalase production
- Coagulase production
-- Biochemical profile
- Molecular typing usually based on PCR procedures.
Bannoehr et al. (2009) reported a procedure for
differentiation of the S. intermedius group (S. intermedius, S
pseudintermedius and  S. deiphini)
involving PCR
amplification of a fragment of the pta gene, followed by the
use of MboI in an RFLP procedure. Sasaki et af. (2010)
developed a multiplex PCR based on the nuc gene which
identified all coagulase-positive staphylococci
·Phage typing, which was used for many years in
epidemiological  investigations such  as those relating  to
outbreaks of staphylococcal food poisoning in humans, has
481
been largely replaced by molecular methods. Pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis following digestion of chromosomal DNA
using a restriction endonuclease is one of the most important
methods used in epidemiological investigations. However,
efforts to harmonize PFGE protocols internationally have
proved difficult, and
common
databases have been
established only at national levels (Deurenberg et al., 2007)
Apart from outbreaks of food poisoning, epidemiological
investigation is frequently  required  in outbreaks of
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in humans and
animals. PFGE-based techniques are useful for such
investigations but are limited by the clonal nature of some
MRSA strains. Other methods used to characterize MRSA
strains include multilocus sequence typing, PCR-based
typing of the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec
(SCC mec) region and spa typing (Frenay et al., 1996;
Enright et af., 2002). The SCC mec region contains the mec
gene which encodes methicillin resistance and the spa gene
encodes staphylococcal protein A production.

Clinical infections
Because staphylococci occur both as commensals on skin
and
mucous
membranes
and
as
environmental
contaminants, infections can be either endogenous or
exogenous in origin. Many infections are opportunistic and
associated with trauma, immunosuppression, intercurrent
parasitic or fungal infections, allergic
conditions
or
endocrine and metabolic disturbances. Coagulase-positive
staphylococci are responsible for the majority of these
infections (Table 14.1). Some strains of low virulence
which are coagulase negative are also capable of causing
disease in  animals
（Table

Bovine staphylococcal mastitis
Staphylococcal mastitis, usually caused by S. aureus, is a
common form of bovine mastitis worldwide. It may be
subclinical, acute or chronic. The majority of infections are
subclinical. Peracute and gangrenous forms are associated
with severe systemic reactions and can be life-threatening.
In gangrenous mastitis, the affected quarter, which
becomes cold and blue- black, eventually sloughs. Tissue
necrosis is attributed to the alpha-toxin which causes
contraction and necrosis of smooth muscle in blood vesse]
walls, impeding blood flow in the affected quarter. In
addition, this toxin causes release of lysosomal enzymes
from leukocytes. Bovine  staphylococcal mastitis
is
discussed in more detail in Chapter 93.

aureus, is confined to hill-grazing regions of Britain and
Ireland where there are suitable habitats for the tick Xxodes
ricinus. Lambs can carry S. aureus on their skin and nasal
 s      
including tick bites. Ixodes ricinus is a vector for the
rickettsial  agent  of   tick-borne
efever,Anaplasma
phagocytophilum, which can cause immuno- suppression
in lambs and may predispose to staphylococcal infection
Tick pyaemia is characterized either by septicaemia and
rapid death or by localized abscess formation in many
484
organs. Clinical manifestations include arthritis, posterior
paresis and ill-thrift. The condition can be of considerable
economic importance on some farms where up to 30% of
lambs between 2 and 10 weeks of age can be affected in
spring and early summer.
Diagnosis
· In young lambs grazing rough pasture in Britain or Ireland,
clinical signs may be indicative of the disease.
· Microscopic demonstration of the bacteria in pus, followed
by isolation and identification of S. aureus from lesions, is
confirmatory.
Treatment and control
Treatment is of limited value in severely affected lambs.
Efforts should be directed at control within the flock.
Prophylactic treatment of lambs with antibiotics, such as
long-acting tetracycline, can be initiated at l week of age.
Tetracyclines
also
protect lambs against A.
phagocytophilum.
· Tick-control measures such as dipping should be introduced.
Exudative epidermitis (greasy-pig disease)
This disease, caused by S. hyicus, occurs worldwide in
sucklers and weaned pigs up to 3 months of age. It is
highly  contagious  and  characterized by  widespread
excessive sebaceous secretion, exfoliation and exudation
on the skin surface. Affected pigs, which are anorexic,
depressed and febrile, have an extensive, non-pruritic
dermatitis with a greasy exudate. Piglets under 3 weeks of
age may die within 24 to 48 hours. Morbidity rates range
485
from 20 to 100%, and mortality rates can reach 90% in
isolated from the vaginal mucosa and skin of healthy sows.
The organisms probably enter the skin of young pigs
through minor abrasions such as bite wounds.
Predisposing stress factors include agalactia in the sow,
intercurrent  infections and  weaning.  Exfoliative  toxin
factor as injection of this toxin into the skin of young pigs
produces exfoliation (Amtsberg, 1979).
Diagnosis
·A high mortality rate in young pigs with exudative,
non-pruritic skin lesions is typical of the disease.
·Isolation and identification of S. hyicus from the dermal
lesions is confirmatory.
Treatment and control
· Early systemic antibiotic therapy combined with topical
  si     s
effective.
·Strict isolation of affected pigs is essential.
· Cleaning and disinfection of contaminated buildings should
be carried out.
· Sows should be washed with a suitable antiseptic soap
before farrowing.
·Prior colonization of the skin with an avirulent strain of S.
hyicus prevented experimental infection with virulent S.
hyicus (Allaker et al., 1988).
Botryomycosis
486
Botryomycosis is a chronic, suppurative granulomatous
condition, often caused by S. aureus. It can occur within a
few weeks of castration in the horse due to infection of the
stumpof  the spermatic cord  (scirrhous  cord)
Botryomycosis can also occur in mammary tissues of
sows. The lesion is composed of a mass of fibrous tissue
containing foci of pus and sinus tracts.
Staphylococcal infections in dogs and cats
Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is commonly  isolated
from pyoderma, otitis externa and other suppurative
conditions including mastitis, endometritis, cystitis,
osteomyelitis and wound infections. Occasionally, similar
suppurative conditions are caused by S. aureus.
Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections in animals
 n        
hospitals  for many  years  but methicillin-  resistant
staphylococcal infections have become a major problem in
veterinary medicine and animal production in the last
decade. Infection with MRSA in small animals, principally
in dogs, has been recorded in many countries, with wound
infections, surgical site infections, pyoderma, otitis and
urinary tract infections most commonly reported (Weese
and van Duijkeren, 2010). Similar conditions have been
reported in horses, including outbreaks of nosocomial
infection in veterinary hospitals (Hartmann et al., 1997 ; O
'Mahony et al., 2005 ; Weese et al., 2005). Transmission
of infection between pets and humans, including veterinary
personnel, and between horses and humans has been
reported (Leonard et al., 2006; Moodley et al., 2006).
487
Colonization rates in veterinary personnel are generally
higher than in the general population and exposure to
MRSA may become an occupational hazard for this
particular group (Weese and van Duijkeren, 2010).
        
with hospitalization, designated community- acquired
MRSA, is a significant problem worldwide. Strains of S
aureus causing these infections are frequently positive for
a leucocidin known as Panton- Valentine leucocidin (PVL
toxin), which is implicated in haemolytic pneumonia and
severe soft tissue and skin infections. Although S. aureus
strains positive for PVL toxin have been isolated from
animals infrequently, most MRSA strains in animals are
PVL negative.
High colonization rates with MRSA in pig farmers (23%)
and others in contact with pigs first emerged as
a problem in The Netherlands in 2004 (Voss et al., 2005).
Unlike MRSA in small animals and horses, the
predominant strain in pigs, designated ST398, appears to
be a pig-adapted strain and was not acquired from humans.
However, human strains of MRSA have been isolated from
pigs also, suggesting that human-to-pig transmission can
occur in addition to transmission from pigs to humans
(Khanna et al., 2008). Although the high colonization rates
with MRSA in pig farmers are of public health concern,
infection with MRSA is rare in pigs. In spite of high
isolation rates of MRSA from nasal swabs in pigs on
infected farms, there are only occasional reports of clinical
conditions such as exudative epidermitis caused by
MRSA.
488
Methicillin resistance can occur in coagulase- negative
staphylococci also but is not of major significance
worldwide. However, methicillin 
resistance
inS.
pseudintermedius is emerging as an important clinical
problem  in  veterinary  medicine
ein many countries,
including the United States and parts of Europe (Weese
and van Duijkeren, 2010). As these organisms are usually
resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial agents including
the β-lactam antibiotics, clinical management of animals
infected with methicillin-resistant  S. pseudintermedius
represents a major challenge to the veterinary profession.

Streptococci
The Streptococci are a group of bacteria that can infect
many animal species, causing suppurative conditions such
as mastitis, metritis, polyarthritis and meningitis. The
enterococci are a related group of organisms, previously
classified in the genus Streptococcus. Strictly anaerobic
Gram-positive cocci, previously placed in the genus
Peptostreptococcus, are now classified as members of the
genus Peptoniphilus (Ezaki et al., 2001). Most pathogenic
speciesare
inthe
genus Streptococcus. These
Gram-positive cocci are approximately 1.0 μm in diameter
and form chains of different lengths (Fig. 15.1).
Streptococcus species are catalase-negative,  facultative
anaerobes, which are non-motile. They are fastidious
bacteria and require the addition of blood or serum to
culture media. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)
occurs as slightly pear-shaped cocci in pairs. Pathogenic
strains have thick capsules and produce mucoid colonies
These bacteria cause pneumonia in humans, guinea-pigs
and rats.
Peptoniphilus indolicus is an anaerobic Gram-positive
coccus, which is aetiologically implicated in bovine
'summer mastitis’ in association with Arcanobacterium
pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae.
Usual habitat
495
The streptococci are distributed worldwide. Most species
live as commensals on the mucosae of the upper
bacteria are susceptible to desiccation and survive for only
short periods off the host.
Key points
· Gram-positive cocci in chains
- Fastidious, requiring enriched media
·Small, usually haemolytic, translucent colonies
· Catalase-negative
· Facultative anaerobes, usually non-motile
· Commensals on mucous membranes
· Susceptible to desiccation
· Cause pyogenic infections
Differentiation of the streptococci
Three procedures are used for conventional laboratory
differentiation of the streptococci, namely type
eof
haemolysis, Lancefield grouping and biochemical testing
· Type of haemolysis on sheep or ox blood agar:
- Beta-haemolysis is complete haemolysis indicated by clear
zones around colonies.
- Alpha-haemolysis is partial or incomplete haemolysis
indicated by greenish or hazy zones around colonies.
 Gamma-haemolysis denotes no observable changes in the
blood agar around colonies.
496
· Lancefield grouping is a serological method of classification
based on the group-specific C-substance. Most pathogenic
streptococci possess C-substance, a cell-wall polysaccharide
antigen, which differs between species or groups of species
and is widely used to classify clinicalisolates of
Streptococcus. Test methods include:
- Ring precipitation test. The C-substance is extracted by
acid or heat from the Streptococcus species under test. This
antigenextract is layeredover antiseraof different
specificities, in narrow tubes placed in plasticine on a slide.
A positive reaction is indicated by the formation of a white
ring of precipitate close to the interface of the two fluids
within 30 minutes (Fig. 15.2).
 Latex agglutination test. Specific C-substance antisera for
  no o uxa n m)    sno
commercially available. Suspensions of latex particles are
antigen is extracted enzymatically from the Streptococcus
under test. A drop of antigen is mixed on a plate with a drop
of each latex-antibody suspension and rocked gently. A
positive reaction, which usually occurs within 1 minute, is
indicated by agglutination (Fig. 15.3).
·Biochemical testing:
-A number of commercial test systems are available for
rapid biochemical identification of streptococci.
-A short range of biochemical tests is used for
differentiating equine group C streptococci.
· Differentiation of streptococcal species can be carried out
using molecular tests such as PCR- based techniques.

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Most of the streptococci that are pathogenic for animals
are pyogenic and are associated with abscess formation,
other
suppurative
conditions
and
septicaemia.
Streptococcus suis, which is non-pyogenic, is a major
pathogen of pigs, causing septicaemia, meningitis and
pneumonia among
 other conditions.
Beta-haemolytic
streptococci are generally more pathogenic than those
producing alpha-haemolysis.
Virulence factors include
enzymes
  and
exotoxins
such
as
streptolysins
(haemolysins),
hyaluronidase,
DNase,
NADase,
streptokinase  and proteases.  The
specific actionand
significance  of
 some
of
these
factors
 are poorly
understood. Polysaccharide capsules, which are major
virulence factors of S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and most
strains of S. equi, are antiphagocytic. The cell-wall M
proteins of S. pyogenes, S. equi and S. porcinus are also
antiphagocytic. In the absence of antiphagocytic factors,
these bacteria are rapidly killed by phagocytes.
Diagnostic procedures
499
History, clinical signs and pathology may be indicative of
certain streptococcal infections such as strangles
· Streptococci are highly susceptible to desiccation and
specimens should be cultured promptly. Pus or exudate
collected on swabs should be placed in
transport medium if  specimens  cannot  be  processed
immediately.
  d a     
has been developed for detecting both viable and non-viable
S. equi in nasal swabs (Timoney and Artiushin, 1997)
·Chains of Gram-positive cocci may be demonstrable in
smears from specimens.
 Specimens should be cultured on blood agar, selective blood
agar and MacConkey agar. Plates are incubated aerobically
at 37°℃ for 24 to 48 hours.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
-Small, translucent colonies, some of which may be mucoid
- Type of haemolysis on blood agar
-- Chains of Gram-positive cocci
 No growth on MacConkey agar with the exception of
Enterococcus species
- Negative catalase test
. Lancefield grouping
- Biochemical test profile.
Clinical infections
Streptococci are often commensals on mucous membranes
and, consequently, many  streptococcal infections are
500
secondary as in streptococcal pneumonia following a viral
infection. Lymph nodes, genital tract or mammary glands
may become infected. Neonatal septicaemia is often
related to matermal genital tract infection. Streptococcus
pyogenes, a human pathogen, occasionally causes bovine
mastitis, tonsillitis in dogs and lymphangitis in foals. A
strain of S. pneumoniae, capsular serotype 3, has been
associated with respiratory disease in young horses during
training, in combination with other pathogens (Chapman et
al., 2000).
Streptococci of animal origin are of limited public health
significance with the major exception of S. suis, which can
cause severe, sometimes fatal, infections in individuals
working with pigs. Streptococcus zooepidemicus subsp.
zooepidemicus and Streptococcus canis are rare zoonoses
also and can cause serious disease in humans. The group B
streptococci, which cause disease in human infants, appear
to be distinct from animal strains in this group.
Streptococcus canis, a significant pathogen of dogs, is
associated with neonatal septicaemia, many suppurative
conditions and toxic shock syndrome (Miller et al., 1996)
on mucous membranes and
 produces  opportunistic
infections in a number of animal species. In addition,
outbreaks of acute haemorrhagic pneumonia in greyhounds
and kenneled dogs have been reported (Pesavento et al..
2008). Strangles, porcine streptococcal meningitis and
bovine  streptococcal mastitis  are important  specific
infections. Vaccines for the control of streptococcal
infections are usually
ineffective.  The clinical

Strangles
Strangles is a highly contagious disease of horses caused
by Streptococcus equi (S. equi subsp. equi). It is a febrile
disease involving
gthe upper respiratory tract with
abscessation of regional lymph nodes.
Epidemiology
Although non-immune Equidae of all ages are susceptible
outbreaks of the disease occur most commonly in young
horses. Assembling horses at sales, shows and racecourses
increases the risk of acquiring infection. Transmission is
via purulent exudates from the upper respiratory tract or
from discharging
 abscesses.
Unlike manyof the
streptococci, the organism is not a commensal and
transmission of infection is frequently attributed to the
introduction of animals incubating the disease and not yet
showing clinical signs, or recovering carrier animals.
 s o  dn  s a s s 
developing clinical signs. A chronic, convalescent carrier
state can develop with bacteria present in the guttural
pouch  and such animals may remain  carriers  with
intermittent shedding for many months. An atypical mild
form, in which S. equi is present in small purulent foci, has
been described.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
502
Infection appears to occur following entry of the organism
into the tonsils with extension to the regional lymph nodes
(Timoney and Kumar, 2008). The bacteria multiply in the
lymph nodes, eliciting
 an  inflammatory response,
outpouring of neutrophils and abscess formation. Large
numbers of neutrophils are attracted to the sites of invasion
cell wall reacts with Ci and stimulates the generation of
chemotactic factors. The organism has many virulence
factors which protect it from the host immune response
and allow it to continue to multiply despite the presence of
many neutrophils. It possesses a hyaluronic capsule and M
proteins which protect it against ingestion and killing and
it may also produce a leukocidal toxin. The M proteins
which project from the surface of the cell wall prevent
activation of the alternative and classical complement
pathways. However, once antibodies against these proteins
are produced by the host, these effects are neutralized and
organisms are effectively phagocytosed. Streptokinase
may facilitate the spread of bacteria in tissue, and
streptolysin S causes lysis of erythrocytes and appears to
damage keratinocytes also (Timoney, 2004). Streptococcus
equi produces a number of phage-encoded superantigens
These superantigens non-specifically stimulate T cells and
are in part responsible for the clinical findings of high
fever, neutrophilia and fibrinogenaemia observed in horses
with strangles

Clinical signs

The incubation period is 3 to 6 days and the course of the
         
fever, depression and anorexia followed by an oculonasal
discharge which becomes purulent. The lymph nodes of
the head
1and
1 neck are swollen and  painful.
Characteristically, the submandibular nodes are affected
and they eventually rupture discharging purulent, highly
infectious material. Guttural pouch empyema is a common
 n %h  dn q  qo a u
rate is usually less than 5%. Reinfection may occur in
some recovered horses but immunity appears to be solid in
approximately 75% of infected animals (Timoney, 2004)
Death may result from complications such as pneumonia,
neurological involvement, asphyxia due to pressure on the
pharynx from enlarged lymph nodes, or purpura
haemorrhagica. Purpura haemorrhagica, considered to be
an immune-mediated disease, may occur in some affected
horses 1 to 3 weeks after initial illness.
Streptococcus zooepidemicus and S. equisimilis, which
produce mild upper respiratory tract infections, must be
differentiated from S. equi.
Bastard strangles, in which abscessation develops in many
organs, is a serious complication in about 1% of affected
animals.
Diagnosis
· Clinical signs and a history of recent exposure to suspect
animals may allow a presumptive diagnosis of strangles.
505
· Colonies are usually mucoid, up to 4 mm in diameter, and
surrounded by a wide zone of beta- haemolysis.
Streptococcus equi must be distinguished from other
Lancefield group C streptococci, particularly S. equisimilis
and S. zooepidemicus, by sugar fermentation in peptone
water containingserum
(Table
15.2)
and
1byother
confirmatory
biochemical
tests.
 Alternatively,
rapid
differentiation of the species may be carried out using
PCR-based tests, including real-time PCR (Baverud et af.,
2007).
 Asymptomatic carriers can be detected using the polymerase
chain reaction test. However, as PCR-based techniques can
detect both live and dead organisms and DNA may persist in
the absence of viable organisms, the culture of lavage
method for detection of carrier animals.
 Subtyping of S. equi strains based on analysis of the gene
encoding the S. equi M protein has been reported recently
and suggests that certain strains may be associated with
particular geographical areas (Waller and Jolley, 2007). This
procedure may be useful for tracing the origin of some
strangles outbreaks.

· Administration of penicillin to in-contact and infected horses
before development of lymphadenopathy is recommended
by some practitioners. Treated horses are often susceptible to
reinfection as treatment prevents the development of an
effective immune response (Sweeney et al., 2005).
Antibiotic therapy is of limited benefit if abscesses have
formed.
·Clinically suspect animals should be isolated.
·Horses should be isolated for 2 weeks when first introduced
or when returning to a property.
A live attenuated intranasal vaccine is available in North
America but it is not licensed for use in Europe because of
concerns about reversion to virulence and other undesirable
side effects. Another live vaccine, attenuated by deletion of
the aroA gene and administered by the submucosal route, is
licensed in Europe. The vaccine reduces clinical signs but
immunity is relatively short-lived. Research on vaccines is
now targeting the development of multicomponent subunit
vaccines (Waller and Jolley, 2007).
· Predisposing factors such as overcrowding and mixing of
different age groups should be avoided.
· Following outbreaks of the disease, buildings and equipment
should be cleaned and disinfected.
Streptococcus suis infections
Streptococcus suis is recognized worldwide as a cause of
significant losses in the pig industry. It is associated with
meningitis, arthritis, septicaemia and bronchop-neumonia
in pigs of all ages, and with sporadic cases of endocarditis,
neonatal deaths and abortion.
Serological and biochemical characteristics of isolates
D, although strains were previously assigned to groups R,
507
S (RS) and T. Serological testing is based on antigenic
differences in capsular material, largely carbohydrate in
nature. At least 35 serotypes of varying virulence have
been recognized. About 70% of S. suis isolates belong to
serotypes 1 to 9 and to serotype 1/2, which has both type 1
and type 2 antigens. Of these, serotype 2 is the most
prevalent serotype with carrier rates of up to 90%. This
serotype is associated with meningitis in both pigs and
humans. Two biotypes, S. suis I and S. suis II, are
identifiable using commercial test systems.
Clinical signs and epidemiology
Asymptomatic carrier pigs harbour S. suis in tonsillar
tissue. Disease outbreaks are most common in intensively
reared pigs when they are subjected to overcrowding, poor
ventilation and other stress factors. Sows carrying the
organisms can infect their litters, leading either to neonatal
deaths or to carrier animals in which characteristic signs
develop later in life. Meningitis, which is often fatal, is
characterized  by   fever,
 tremors,   incoordination,
opisthotonos and convulsions.
In North America, S. suis is often isolated from cases of
respiratory disease in conjunction with Mycoplasma and
Pasteurella species. Serious infections occur periodically
in humans directly involved in pig husbandry or
processing. Infections with S. suis have also been recorded
in cattle, small ruminants, horses and cats.
Pathogenesis
508
Although a number of virulence factors have been
described for S. suis, their exact role in the pathogenesis of
infection has not been fully elucidated. The capsule and an
opacity factor are both essential pathogenic factors as
isogenic mutants lacking either factor are markedly less
virulent. In addition, strains positive for suilysin,
extracellular factor (EF) and muramidase- released protein
(MRP) are considerably more virulent than strains lacking
these factors and are positively associated with systemic
infection (Beineke et al., 2008: Wei et al., 2009)
Suilysin is a haemolysin and many S. suis isolates are
haemolytic  on
blood
agar.
Adhesins
such
as
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
and
fibronectin-binding proteins  are  virulence factors  that
facilitate binding of S. suis to host cells and it is thought
that hyaluronidase may function in local spread of the
organism. Genes encoding for adhesins are up-regulated at
the early stages of infection whereas genes encoding
factors such as EF are up- regulated as the disease
progresses (Tan et al., 2008).
Control
These bacteria tend to become endemic in a herd and
eradication is not feasible.  Improved husbandry may
decrease the prevalence of clinical disease. Research is
ongoing on the development of subunit vaccines
containing capsular
antigens,EFandMRP
as
immunogens.
Most strains of S. suis are susceptible to penicillin or
ampicillin. Prophylactic long- acting penicillin, given by
509
injection to sows 1 week prior to farrowing and to piglets
during the first 2 weeks of life, has proved worthwhile in
herds experiencing neonatal deaths or meningitis at
weaning. Streptococcus suis strains remain susceptible to
       
levels of resistance to these drugs of between 4.o% and
22% have been reported from China (Zhang et al., 2008).
Bovine streptococcal mastitis
Streptococcus agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae and S. uberis are
the principal pathogens involved in streptococcal mastitis.
Enterococcus faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. zooepidemicus
are less commonly isolated from cases of mastitis.
Streptococcus agalactiae colonizes the milk ducts and
produces persistent infection with intermittent bouts of acute
mastitis.
Streptococcus dysgalactiae, which is found in the buccal
cavity and genitalia and on the skin of the mammary gland,
causes acute mastitis.
Streptococcus uberis, a normal inhabitant of skin, tonsils and
vaginal mucosa, is a major cause of clinical mastitis, usually
without systemic signs.

Treatment and control
Adetailed description of bovine mastitis including
streptococcal mastitis is presented in Chapter 93.
Enterococcus species
These enteric organisms are found in the intestinal tract of
animals and humans. They are opportunistic pathogens and
differ phenotypically from the Streptococcus species in
two important respects:
·They tolerate bile salts and grow on MacConkey agar as red,
pin-point colonies.
·Some isolates are motile.
There are a number of species in the genus Enterococcus
but E. faecalis is the species most frequently isolated from
domestic animals and poultry. Enterococcus faecium is
also found in the intestinal tract of many species.
Enterococcus species cause opportunistic infections such
as wound infections in all species, mastitis in cattle, and
urinary tract and ear infections in dogs. They are
intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial agents, which
can
causeproblems
relating
 to theselectionof
antimicrobial drugs.  In addition,  vancomycin-resistant
enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens in human
hospitals, and vancomycin resistance in animal isolates of
E. faecium is a major public health concern (Aarestrup et
al., 2001). Increasing levels of resistance to vancomycin in
animal isolates was associated with the use of avoparcin in
512
animals. However, levels of resistance have decreased
markedly since the use of avoparcin was banned in 1997,
although resistance in animal isolates has not disappeared
completely (DANMAP, 2005).

Actinobacteria
TheclassActinobacteriacomprisesaphylogeneti-cally
diverse group of Gram-positive bacteria which includes a
number of families containing pathogens of veterinary
importance (Fig. 16.1). In addition, the class contains a
large number of organisms that are not of pathogenic
significance. This chapter presents information mainly on
genera within the family Actinomycetaceae of the suborder
Actinomycineae, Actinomyces species, Arcanobacterium
species and Actinobaculum species. The genera Nocardia,
Derma-tophilus and Crossiella, which are members of the
class Actinobacteria, are
included also. Because of
filament formation and granulomatous responses to tissue
invasion, these organisms were originally regarded as
fungi. However, filaments of these bacteria rarely exceed
1 μ m in width, whereas hyphae of the eukaryo-tic fungi are
usually more than 5 μ m wide. The comparative features of
these genera are summarized in Table 16.1.

the group are Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Actinobaculum

Actinomyces

Actinomycesviscosus
and
Actinomyces hordeovulneris. The main diseases associated
with these bacteria are summarized in Table 16.2
521
Usual habitat
Withthe
exception of A. hordeovulneris, pathogenic
members of these genera colonize the mucous membranes
of mammals. Actinomyces bovis is found in the oropharynx
of cattle and other domestic animals, and Actinomyces
viscosus is a commensal in the oral cavity of dogs and
humans. Arcanobacterium pyogenes is commonly present
on the nasopharyngeal mucosa of cattle, sheep and pigs
The usual habitat of Actinobaculum suis is the preputial
mucosa of boars. Although the habitat of Actinomyces
hordeovulneris is uncertain, the organism appears to be
closely associated with awns in the seed heads of grasses
of the genus Hordeum. The seed heads of these grasses are
often referred to as foxtails in North America.

· Each species has a defined atmospheric growth requirement.
· Colonial morphology and haemolytic activity:
- Arcanobacterium pyogenes produces a characteristic hazy
haemolysis along streak lines after aerobic incubation for 24
hours. Pin-point colonies become visible after 48 hours.
-Actinomyces bovis and A.hordeovuineris colonies
typically adhere  to agar media and are  usually
non-haemolytic.
-Actinomyces viscosus can produce two colony types, one
large and smooth and the other small and rough. The large
colony is composed of V, Y and T cell configurations and
the smaller colonies are formed of short branching filaments.
- Actinobaculum suis produces colonies which are up to 3

·Biochemica! reactions. Specialized techniques, usually
conducted in reference laboratories, are required for
definitive identification of most of these fastidious,
slow-growing organisms. In routine diagnosis, a presumptive
identification of A. pyogenes is based on colonial
morphology and pitting of a Loeffler's serum slope within
24 hours, which indicates pro-teolytic activity. It also
hydrolyses gelatin.
·Granuies in pus. Granules can be detected when pus is
diluted with distilled water in a Petri dish. In infections
granules' are found. Whitish, soft, grey granules are
523
demonstrable in pus from animals infected with A. viscosus.
Granules in lesions caused by A. bovis contain characteristic
clubs (Fig. 16.3). Club colony formation is a feature of other
chronic infections such as bovine actinobacillosis caused by
Actinobacillus lignieresiiand
botryomycosis
usually
associated with Staphylococcus aureus.
 Urease is produced by A. suis.
Analysis of 16s rRNA gene sequences can be used for
identification and classification of organisms in this group

a

exotoxin, pyolysin, which is cytolytic for several cell types
including
neutrophils and
macrophages, 
and
dermonecrotic and lethal for laboratory animals. It is a
major virulence factor of A. pyogenes as mutants lacking
525
experimentally infected mice (Jost and Billington, 2005 ).
Neuraminidases produced by A. pyogenes are thought to
assist in adherence of the organism to host tissues,
probably by exposing hidden host cell receptors for other
adhesins (Jost and Billington, 2o05). Arcanobacterium
pyogenes produces a number of other adhesins also.
including   extracellular  matrix-binding   proteins  and
fimbriae. This bacterium also produces proteases whose
role as potential virulence factors is not yet determined.
Virulence attributes of Actinomyces species important in
veterinary medicine have not been established. Purulent
reactions are typical of infections with A. pyogenes,
whereas  A.bovis  and
A.
viscosus
provoke
pyogranulomatous reactions.
Diagnostic procedures
· Species of animal affected, clinical presentation and type
and location of lesions may suggest the species involved.
·Specimens suitable for laboratory procedures  include
exudates, aspirates and tissue samples for culture and
histopathology.
·Gram-stained smears may reveal morphological forms
typical of the aetiological agent (Fig. 16.2). Unlike Nocardia
species, Actinomyces species are modified Ziehl-Neelsen
(MZN) negative (Table 16. 1).
· Histopathological examination of specimens from lesions
caused by A. bovis reveals aggregates of filamentous
organisms surrounded by eosinophilic club-shaped structures
(Fig. 16.3).
· Blood and MacConkey agars are inoculated with the
specimen and incubated at 37°C for up to 5 days. The
atmospheric requirements for different species are indicated
526
in Table 16.3. Species identification based on phenotypic
characteristics is difficult except in the case of A. pyogenes.
· Identification criteria for isolates: - Colonial characteristics
-- Morphology in stained smears
- Presence or absence of haemolysis on blood agar
- Absence of growth on MacConkey agar
- Presence or absence of growth when subcultured onto
Sabouraud dextrose agar
Pitting of a Loeffler” s serum slope （ A. pyogenes)-
Urease production (A. suis).
· Because species identification is difficult for organisms
within the group, PCR analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
sequence is increasingly used for confirmation of identity.
Clinical infections
The disease conditions produced by the pathogenic
Actinomyces, Arcanobacterium and Actinobaculum species
are presented in Table 16.2. In some conditions, the
identity of the actinomycete has not been clearly defined.
An unclassified Actinomyces species resembling A. bovis
has been isolated from pyogranu-lomatous mastitis in
sows. Abortion in sows has been ascribed to A. naeslundii,
an organism usually associated with human dental caries
(Palmer et al., 1979). An Actinomyces species, probably A.
bovis, has been identified in the suppurative discharges
from poll evil and fistulous withers in horses.
Infections with Arcanobacterium pyogenes
527
Arcanobacterium pyogenes is an opportunistic pathogen
and is a common cause of suppurative lesions in many
domestic species worldwide, especially cattle, pigs and
sheep. Any organ system may be affected. Cases of
lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis, peritonitis and
1  neural
abscessation are commonly encountered. The organism has
also been associated with pyometra, metritis and acute
mastitis in cows. In the acute bovine mastitis referred to as
summer mastitis’ in Britain and Ireland, the anaerobic
bacterium Peptoniphilus indoli-cus is frequently associated
with A. pyogenes. Arcanobacterium pyogenes also occurs
in association with anaerobes in other mixed infections
such as foot abscesses in cattle and sheep (see Chapter 91)
Diagnosis is based on  the  typical  pleomorphic  cell
morphology  in  Gram-stained  smears from specimens,
colonial characteristics and the ability of A. pyogenes to pit
a Loeffler's serum slope. Although the organism was
previously regarded as susceptible to many antimicrobial
agents, there are reports of resistance to agents such as the
macrolides and tetracyclines, which are commonly used
for growth promotion and disease prevention in the USA
(Trinh et al., 2002).
Canine actinomycosis
Actinomyces viscosus is the aetiological agent of canine
actinomycosis.Infection

：insubcutaneous
pyogranulomatous lesions  and  extensive fibrovascular
proliferation on the peritoneal or pleural surfaces with
sanguinopurulent exudate in the affected cavity. The
thoracic lesions  closely resemble those of  canine
nocardiosis.  The main  clinical  finding  is  respiratory
distress. Actinomyces viscosus has also been isolated from
528
cutaneous lesions in a horse (Specht et al., 1991) and from
a heifer which had aborted (Okewole et al., 1989). The
lesions associated with A. hordeovulneris infection in the
dog include cutaneous and visceral pyogranulomas,
pleuritis, peritonitis 
S and  arthritis.   In uncomplicated
infections, A. viscosus is usually responsive to treatment
with penicillin. A new species, Actinomyces canis, which
was isolated from a number of different clinical conditions
in dogs, has been described (Hoyles et al., 2000)
Bovine actinomycosis (lumpy jaw)
Invasion of the mandible and, less commonly, the maxilla
of cattle by A. bovis causes a chronic rarefying
osteomyelitis. The organism is presumed to invade the
tissues following trauma to the mucosa from rough feed or
through dental alveoli during tooth eruption. A painless
swelling of the affected bone enlarges over a period of
several weeks. The swelling becomes painful, and fistulous
tracts discharging purulent exudate develop. Spread to
contiguous soft tissues may occur but there is minimal
involvement of regional lymph nodes.
Diagnosis
·Clinical signs are often distinctive in advanced cases.
· Radiography can be used to determine the degree of bone
destruction.
· Other appropriate diagnostic techniques (see Diagnostic
procedures).
·Lumpy jaw should be distinguished from other conditions
which result in swelling of the bones of the jaw and from
actinobacillosis which may involve the soft tissues of the
head.
529
Treatment
·When lesions are small and circumscribed, surgery is the
therapy of choice. In advanced cases, surgical treatment is
frequently unrewarding.
·Prolonged therapy with penicillin, given parenterally to
animals early in the disease, may be of value. Isoniazid per
os for 30 days has also been recommended.
Porcine cystitis and pyelonephritis
This specific disease, which affects the urinary tract of
d      s  
fatal. The pathogen, Actinobaculum suis, can be isolated
from the prepuce and preputial diverticulum of healthy
boars but not from the urogenital tract of healthy sows.
Boars are rarely affected clinically and sows usually
develop evidence of disease 3 to 4 weeks after mating.
Anorexia, arching of the back, dysuria and haematuria are
prominent signs. If both kidneys are extensively damaged,
death may result.  The diagnostic procedures and
therapeutic measures appropriate for this disease are
similar to those for bovine pyelonephritis (see Chapter 17).
Nocardia species
Members of the Nocardia species are Gram-positive,
aerobic, saprophytic actinobacteria. In smears of exudate
from infected tissue, they appear as long, slender,
branching filaments with a tendency to fragment into rods
and cocci (Fig. 16.4). When cultured, these organisms
produce aerial filaments which may  form   spores.

as they appear in smears from lesions. The filaments have
a tendency to fragment.
Usual habitat
Nocardia  species  are  saprophytes  found  in  soil  and
decaying vegetation.
Differentiation of Nocardia species
Phenotypic identification of Nocardia species is difficult
and is based on specialized biochemical tests and analysis
of mycolic acid composition. Molecular methods based on
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene are now frequently
employed for definitive identification. Up to 9o Nocardia
species are recognized, including N. asteroides, N.
farcinica and many other species which have been
associated with disease in animals and humans.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
531
Infection, which is opportunistic, is usually associated with
immunosuppression or, alternatively, may follow a heavy
challenge. The usual mode of infection is by inhalation but
it may also occur through skin wounds or via the teat
canal. An intestinal form of nocardiosis may result from
ingestion of the organisms
Virulent strains of N. asteroides survive intracellularly.
The production of superoxide dismutase and catalase and
the presence of a thick peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall
confer resistance to microbiocidal activity of phagocytes.
Cell-mediated immunity is essential for protection against
infection by this facultative, intracellular bacterium (Deem
et al.,1982)
Diagnostic procedures
A  presumptive  diagnosis  of  infection  with  Nocardia
species  is  based on  clinical findings  and laboratory
procedures.
·Specimens suitable for laboratory examination include
exudates, aspirates, mastitic milk, tissue from granulomas
and fixed tissue for histopathology.
·Smears of exudate should be stained by the Gram and MZN
methods. Nocardia species are MZN-positive, unlike
Actinomyces species which are MZN-negative.
· Histopathological examination of tissue specimens may
reveal clusters of nocardial filaments.
·The organism can be cultured on blood agar or on selective
growth-enhancing media such as charcoal- yeast extract
medium. Plates are incubated aerobically at 37°C for up to
10 days.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
532
-Colonies on blood agar are usually visible after incubation
for about 5 days. They are white, powdery and firmly
adherent to the agar. Colonies are variably haemolytic and
odourless.
- Subculture on to Sabouraud dextrose agar yields dry,
wrinkled, orange-coloured colonies after incubation for up to
5 days.
Gram-stainedsmears fromcolonies showsome
filamentous forms with a preponderance of rod and coccal
forms.
·Nocardia species require differentiation from Streptomyces
species which may contaminate laboratory media. Features
of Streptomyces species which distinguish them from
Nocardia species
s include a strong, earthy odour,
MZN-negative  filaments  and  colonies  on  Sabouraud
· DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is a frequently used
method for identification of nocardial species.
Clinical infections
Historically, Nocardia asteroides was thought to account
for most nocardial  infections  in  domestic animals.
However, with the advent of new, molecular-based
methods of identification, many organisms previously
classified as N. asteroides are now known to belong to
other nocardial species (Brown-Elliott et al., 2006). Thus,
it is likely that nocardial disease in animals is due to a
number of different species within the genus (Table 16.4).
The most commonly encountered conditions are cutaneous
and systemic infections in dogs and mastitis in cattle, with
recent  publications documenting  a  Nocardia  farcinica
mastitis epizootic in Canada (Brown et al., 2007 ) and an
533
(Pisoni et al., 2008). Nocardial infection has been reported
occasionally in horses, immunosuppression being an
important predisposing factor (Biberstein et al., 1985).
Nocardia aster-oides has also been associated with
abortion in sows (Koehne, 1981). Nocardia farcinica is
implicated in bovine farcy. Nocardia brasiliensis and N.
otitidiscavi-arum (N. caviae ) are pathogenic for humans
and rarely cause disease in domestic animals.

Canine nocardiosis
Infections in dogs due to Nocardia species are acquired by
inhalation, through skin wounds or by ingestion. Thoracic.
cutaneous and disseminated forms of the disease are
recognized. The thoracic form is characterized by fever,
534
anorexia and respiratory distress. There is a fibrovascular
proliferative reaction on the pleura and sanguinopurulent
fluid accumulates in the thoracic cavity. The cutaneous
form presents either as an indolent ulcer or as a
granulomatous swelling with discharging fistulous tracts.
In the disseminated form, which occurs typically in dogs
less than 12 months of age, clinical signs are non-specific
 and are referable to the organ system mainly affected.
Diagnosis
Although canine nocardiosis is clinically similar to canine
actinomycosis, antibiotic therapy for nocardiosis is less
effective. Consequently, it is essential to distinguish the
main aetiological agents, Nocardia species and A.
viscosus. The main differentiating features of these
organisms are listed in Table 16.5.
Treatment
Nocardia species show  a marked  variation in their
susceptibility to antibiotics. Susceptibility testing is carried
out
tby specializedlaboratories using
the broth
microdilution technique. Effective antibiotics, which
include amikacin, imipenem-cilastatin and cotrimoxazole,
should be administered systemically for at least 6 weeks

Bovine nocardial mastitis
A chronic form of bovine mastitis results from infection
withNocardia
species.
.Fibrosis,
either diffuse
multifocal, develops
 and
white clots are evident
intermittently in the milk. Multifocal fibrosis can be
detected clinically as discrete hard masses, up to 5 cm in
diameter, palpable in the affected gland after milking.
Infection during early lactation may occasionally induce a
systemic reaction with fever, depression and anorexia.
Nocardial mastitis is usually sporadic, affecting only one
or two cows in a herd, and is usually refractory to
chemotherapy. However, outbreaks associated with the use
of dry-cow therapy, particularly neomycin - containing
products, have been reported (Brown et al., 2007)
Bovine farcy
This disease, also known as bovine nocardiosis, is limited
to the tropics. It is a chronic infection of super-ficial
lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. Early lesions consist
of small cutaneous nodules, often on the medial aspect of
the legs and on the neck. These nodules enlarge slowly and
coalesce to form swellings, up to 10 cm in diameter, which
536
rarely ulcerate.  The lymphatic vessels may become
thickened and cord - like. Internal organs may be affected
occasionally and the condition is important because lesions
resemble those
of   tuberculosis. Because Nocardia
farcinica,

farcinogenes and M.
senegalense have been isolated from such lesions, the
aetiology of bovine farcy requires clarification.

it produces motile coccal zoospores about 1.5μ m in

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Dermatophilus
congolensis
Sdoesnotusuallyinvade
healthy skin. Trauma and persistent wetting predispose to
skin invasion.
Microenvironmental
1conditions which
interfere with normal surface protective mechanisms, such
as sebaceous secretions, also lead to activation of dormant
zoospores. When activated, zoospores produce germ tubes
and these develop into filaments which invade the
epidermis. The ability of individual strains to invade the
epidermis is related to their virulence. Strains vary in
virulence, which may be related to the ability to produce
538
an alkaline ceramidase (Norris et al., 2008).
Invasion leads to an acute inflammatory response
characterized by large numbers of neutrophils which
ultimately form microabscesses in the epidermis. A
cyclical patterm of invasion of regenerating epithelial cells
by the pathogen, together with serous exudation and
microabscess formation, leads to the development of raised
scab-like crusts containing numerous branching filaments.
Factors that depress specific immune responses, including
intercurrent diseases and pregnancy, may increase host
susceptibility to dermatophilosis.
Diagnostic procedures
The clinical picture is usually indicative of the infection.
particularly in endemic areas.
· Specimens suitable for laboratory examination include scab
material and samples of skin fixed in formalin.
·Smears from the undersurface of scabs or from softened scab
material, stained by the Giemsa method, reveal the
characteristic branching filaments containing zoospores (Fig.
16.5). When there is difficulty demonstrating the organism
in   smears,   histopathological 
orimmunofluorescent
techniques may be employed.
·Scab material softened with water is cultured on blood agar
at 37°C in an atmosphere of 2.5 to 10% CO2 for up to 5
days.
· Zoospores, which exhibit chemotaxis for CO2, can be

 u u  sxa q o sn  r
CO2 for 15 minutes. A sample from the surface of the water
contains motile zoospores, which can be cultured.
·Identification criteria:
539
- After incubation for 48 hours, colonies are up to 1 mm in
diameter, yellow and haemolytic. When incubated for 3 to 4
days, they become rough, golden-yellow and embedded in
the agar. Older colonies may have a mucoid appearance.
-Giemsa-stained smears  from  colonies reveal solidly
staining filaments.
-- Growth does not occur on Sabouraud dextrose agar.
 Biochemical tests are rarely required for identifi-cation.
The organism liquefies   Loeffler's serum medium,
hydrolyses gelatin and casein, and produces acid from
glucose and fructose.
- As with other members of the actinobacteria, methods of
identification based on sequencing of the 16s rRNA gene

2002).
Clinical infections
Infections with D. congolensis are usually confined to the
epidermis. However, invasion of subcutaneous tissue has
been described in a cat (Jones, 1976). Commonly used
designations for infection with this organism are
dermatophilosis and cutaneous streptothricosis. Mycotic
dermatitis (a misnomer) and lumpy wool are used to
describe infection of woolled areas of the skin in sheep.
When the skin of the lower limbs of sheep is involved, the
condition is termed strawberry footrot.
Although the disease affects animals of all ages, it is more
prevalent and often more severe in young animals.
540
Damage to the skin predisposes to infection with D
congolensis. Zoospores are most often transmitted by
direct contact with infected animals. In endemic tropical
regions, the prevalence and severity of dermatophilosis
correlates with infestationwithAmblyommavariegatum
(Morrow et al., 1989). Anumber of blood-sucking insects
tropics. Economic loss derives from damage to hides and
fleeces. In addition, dermatophilosis creates a strong
predisposition to fly strike in sheep (Norris et al., 2008 ).
Human skin infections, occasionally acquired through
close contact with infected animals, are rare (Stewart,
1972; Burd et al.,2007).
Clinical signs
Lesion distribution usually correlates with those areas of
skin predisposed to infection. Heavy prolonged rainfall in
association with warm environmental temperatures can
result in lesions predominantly affecting the dorsum of
farm animals. Trauma to the face and limbs of animals
grazing in thorny scrub can predispose to lesions in these
sites. Early lesions present as papules and are often
detectable only by palpation. As lesions progress, serous
exudate causes matting of hairs giving them a tufted
appearance. Lesions may coalesce to form irregular
elevated crusty scabs. Tufts of hair can be readily plucked
from the lesion along with adherent scab material and
underlying exudate. Scab formation tends to be more
pronounced in cattle and sheep than in horses.
Localized infections are usually of little consequence.
Lesions may resolve spontaneously within a few weeks,
541
particularly in dry conditions. In severe infections, lesions
may be extensive and deaths may occasionally occur,
particularly in calves and lambs. Rarely, oral lesions result
in depression, difficulty with eating and loss of condition.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on the clinical appearance of lesions
and demonstration of D. congolensis in scabs. Isolation of
the organism is confirmatory.
Treatment
Parenterally administered antibiotics such as long-acting
oxytetracycline are usually effective. Alternatively, high
doses  of penicillin-streptomycin combinations on three
consecutive days may be used. For treatment to be
effective,  satisfactory epidermal concentrations of the
antibiotics are required. The outcome of treatment is
influenced by the severity and extent of lesions. Topical
treatments are ineffective.
Control
Control measures  vary  with geographical  location  and
climatic factors; they are based on minimizing the effects
of predisposing factors and early treatment of clinical
cases.
· Clinically affected animals should be isolated and treated
promptly.
· Shelter should be provided during periods of prolonged
rainfall.
·Grazing areas should be cleared of thorny scrub.
542
· Tick infestation must be reduced by dipping or spraying with
acaricides at weekly intervals and by elimination of tick
habitats.
· Prophylactic use of long-acting tetracyclines may be
required in endemic regions.
·Control of intercurrent diseases reduces the severity of
dermatophilosis.
·Research is continuing on increasing the resistance of cattle

Crossiella equi
This organism is a member of the Actinobacteria in the
suborder Pseudonocardineae. It is associated with equine
nocardiform placentitis, leading to loss of the foal in
approximately 50% of cases (Donahue et al., 2002).

Corynebacterium species
Corynebacterium
species
are
small, pleomorphic
Gram-positive bacteria which occur in coccoid, club and
rod forms (coryneform morphology). In stained smears
they occur singly, in palisades of parallel cells and in
angular clusters resembling Chinese characters (Fig. 17.1).
The type species is Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the
cause of diphtheria in children.
Thegenus
Corynebacterium
 formerly contained  a
miscellaneous collection of bacteria. Recently, DNA and
16S rRNA studies have assigned several former members
of the corynebacteria to other genera. The corynebacteria
are considered to belong to a group of organisms within
the Corynebacteriaceae known as the CMN group, which
contains the genera Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium,
Nocardia and Rhodococcus.Although the group is
heterogeneous, the organisms all have a high G+C content
and their cell walls contain mycolic acids. The mycolic
acids of the corynebacteria are shorter than those of other
genera within the group and the carbon chains are usually
saturated.
Most
corynebacteria
are
catalase-positive,
oxidasenegative, non-spore-forming facultative anaerobes
which require enriched media for growth. Pathogenic
corynebacteria are non-motile.  Tissue trauma usually
precedes the establishment of pathogenic corynebac-teria
and the resulting lesions are characterized by suppuration
548

· Fastidious, requiring enriched media
· Majority are commensals on mucous membranes

Differentiation of the corynebacteria
Most pathogenic corynebacteria are relatively host specific
and produce identifiable clinical syndromes. The host
species and the nature of the disease may suggest the
causal agent. Identification criteria include bacterial cell
morphology, colonial
  appearance   and
 biochemical
reactions. An enhancement of the haemolysis test is used
for the identification of C. pseudotuberculosis
 Colonial characteristics:
549
Corynebacterium bovis is a lipophilic bacterium which
produces small, white, dry, non-haemolytic colonies in the
well of plates inoculated with a bovine milk sample.
Corynebacterium kutscheri produces whitish colonies.
Occasional isolates are haemolytic.
-Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis has small, whitish
colonies surrounded by a narrow zone of complete
  mn d  n  o  m 'si
After several days the colonies become dry, crumbly and
cream-coloured.
- Members of the C renale group produce small
the differentiating features of the three species in the group
(Table 17.2).
·Biochemical reactions:
- Conventional or commercially available biochemical tests
can be used to differentiate the corynebacteria.
 Two biotypes of C. pseudotuberculosis are recognized.
The ovine/caprine strains lack nitrate-reducing capacity,
while the equine/bovine strains usually reduce nitrate.
although non-nitrate-reducing strains have been isolated
from clinical infections in cattle (Yeruham et af., 2004) and
from horses (Connor et af., 2000).
-The biochemical reactions used to distinguish members of
the C. renale group are indicated in Table 17.2.
- Urease is produced by all pathogenic corynebac-teria with
the exception of C. bovis.
·Enhancement of haemolysis test:
550
- The haemolysis produced by C. pseudotuber-culosis is
enhanced when the organisms are inoculated across a streak
of Rhodococcus equi (Fig. 17.2).

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
552
Many   corynebacteria  are    opportunistic   pathogens.
Corynebacteria, with the exception of C. bovis, are
pyo-genic organisms that cause a variety of suppurative
conditions in domestic animals. Corynebacterium bovis,
which is found in the teat canal of up to 20% of apparently
healthy dairy cows, provokes a mild neutrophil response. It
has been suggested that this response may protect the
mammary
gland against invasion by  more virulent
pathogens (Pociecha, 1989 ). However, there are
conflicting data on the significance of infection with C.
bovis in the mammary gland and Huxley et al. (2004)
suggest that this may be due in part to the incorrect
identification of isolates in previous studies. They found
2.8% of a collection of 762 isolates to be species other
than C. bovis when tested using molecular methods.
Corynebacterium   pseudotuberculosis  is  a  facultative
intracellular pathogen capable of surviving and repli-cating
in phagocytes. The virulence of this pathogen is linked to
its cell wall lipid and to the production of an exotoxin,
phospholipase  D (PLD).
Thisenzyme
hydrolyses
sphingomyelin in mammalian cell membranes, releasing
choline. In the early stages of infection, PLD may enhance
survival and multiplication of C. pseudotuberculosis in the
host. Another protective antigen, corynebacterial secreted
role in virulence as immunization with this antigen
considerable protection against infection (Baird and
Fontaine,  2007). BothC.
ulcerans  and
[C
pseudotuberculosis can  produce  diphtheria  toxin  when
lysogenized by corynephage beta which possesses the tox
gene. Although the effect of this toxin in animals is
553
unclear, its presence in raw milk from cows infected with
C. ulcerans may have public health implications.
Bacteria in the C. renale group are urinary tract pathogens
which cause cystitis and pyelonephritis in cattle. These
organisms produce
eurease, which hydrolyses urea.
Members of the C. renale group possess fimbriae which
and C. pseudotuberculosis, whereas the urinary tract
pathogens avail of diminished immunological defences or
local tissue damage following parturition.
Diagnostic procedures
· The species of animal affected and the clinical signs may
suggest a specific diagnosis.
 Suitable specimens for laboratory examination include pus,
exudate, samples of affected tissue and mid-stream urine.
·Direct microscopic examination of Gram-stained smears

· Culture media for routine use include blood agar, selective
       g
incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 to 48 hours.
· Identification criteria for isolates: - Colonial characteristics
-- Presence or absence of haemolysis
- Aerobic or anaerobic incubation requirements
- Absence of growth on MacConkey agar
- Typical coryneform pleomorphism in a Gram-stained
smear from culture (Fig. 17.1)

·Molecular techniques have been developed for the detectior
and identification of C. pseudotubercu-fosis. Cetinkaya et al.
(2002) reported a PCR-based method for the identification of
isolates, and Pacheco et af. (2007) used a multiplex PCR
technique both for identification of isolates and for direct
detection of the organism in specimens of pus.
Clinical infections
 main  diseases   caused  by infections   with
Corynebacterium species are summarized in Table 17.1.
Corynebacterium  pseudotuberculosis  causes  occasional
human infections, some acquired from infected animals
and others from environmental sources. Toxigenic strains
of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans are occasionally found in
animals and may represent a rare source of infection for
humans (Henricson et al., 2000 ; de Zoysa et al., 2005)
Caseous lymphadenitis
Caseous lymphadenitis, caused by the non-nitrate-reducing
biotype of C. pseudotuberculosis, is a chronic suppurative
condition of sheep, goats and rarely cattle. Infection results
in abscessation and enlargement of superficial or internal
lymph nodes. The incubation period is about 3 months.
The disease is prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, the
Middle East, Asia, Africa and parts of North and South
America. Caseous lymphadenitis is being reported more
555
frequently in Britain and other European countries.
Ill-thrift may be evident in affected animals, and the
disease invariably results in condemnation of car-casses
and devaluation of hides. Infection is spread by pus from
ruptured abscesses and from nasal and oral secretions. The
organism can survive in the environment for several
months.  Corynebacterium pseudotuber-culosis has been
isolated from the milk of affected goats.
Sheep become infected through contamination of shearing
wounds, by arthropod bites or from contaminated dips
Affected lymph nodes are enlarged and, when the infection
becomes
chronic,  exhibit

cross-section. The abscess material is caseous, initially
greenish and later putty-coloured. Haematogenous spread
can lead to abscessation of internal lymph nodes without
obvious superficial lesions. Ill-thrift and pneumonia may
be present. The visceral form of the disease may not be
detectable ante mortem. Goats
Susually develop the
superficial form of the disease
ewithsubcutaneous
abscesses in the head and neck regions. The different
distribution of lesions observed in sheep and goats
probably reflects differences in management practices and
behavioural factors which facilitate transmission such as
shearing  of sheep  and  grooming and  head-butting
behaviour in goats.
Diagnosis
·The disease may be suspected on clinical grounds or at
post-mortem examination.

· Smears from lesions may reveal Gram-positive coryneform

· Isolation and identification of C. pseudotubercufosis from

detection of C. pseudotubercufosis infection. These tests
detect antibodies directed against either cell wall antigens or
the exotoxin (PLD). A double antibody sandwich ELISA
based on PLD was reported to be sensitive (79 ± 5%) and
highly spe-cific (99 ± 1%) in sheep (Dercksen et al., 2000).
·Sunil et al. (2008) investigated the use of an interferon -
test for detection of infection and eradication of caseous
lymphadenitis in sheep flocks, and concluded that it showed
considerable promise.
Treatment
Because of the chronic nature of lesions and the ability of
the organisms to survive intracellularly, therapy is usually
ineffective, although C. pseudotuberculosis strains are
susceptible to most classes of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
Control
Appropriate control measures for individual countries are
determined by the prevalence of the disease.
· Exclusion of caseous lymphadenitis from countries free of
the disease:
- Sheep and goats should be imported only from countries
which are either free of the disease or have a low incidence
of infection. Animals must be selected from flocks or herds
officially certified to be free of infection for 3 years.
- Animals should be subjected to pre-importation testing
using ELISA.
557
- Imported  animals  should be quarantined   for  several
months and infected animals should be slaughtered.
·Eradication of caseous lymphadenitis from countries with a
low prevalence of the disease:
- Animals with obvious lesions should be segregated and
culled.
Regular testing of flocks or herds using ELISA should be
followed by culling of animals with positive or doubtful
results.
 Lambs should be removed from seropositive dams at birth
and reared artificially.
- Contaminated  buildings  and  equipment  should  be
thoroughly disinfected.
· Control measures in countries with a high prevalence of
caseous lymphadenitis:
- Strict hygienic measures should be applied in buildings
such as shearing sheds. Shearing and docking equipment
should be regularly and thoroughly disinfected.
Vaccines are available for use in some countries and may
have a place in control programmes. Bacterins, toxoid and
combinations of bacterin and toxoid vaccines have been
developed. In addition, live attenuated vaccines and DNA
vaccines have been investigated, some of which gave
and Fontaine, 2007).
Ulcerative lymphangitis
The nitrate-reducing biotype of C. pseudotuberculosis
causes sporadic cases of ulcerative lymphangitis in horses
and cattle. Ulcerative lymphangitis occurs in Africa, the
558
Americas, the Middle East and India. In the USA, the
disease is prevalent in autumn and early winter and is more
common in horses than in cattle. Infection occurs through
skin wounds or arthropod bites or by contact with
contaminated harness. The condition presents either as
lymphangitis of the lower limbs or abscessation in the
pectoral region. The onset of lymphangitis is slow and the
condition usually becomes chronic. Affected lymphatic
vessels are swollen and firm and nodules form along their
length. Oedema develops in affected limbs, and ulcerated
nodules exude a thick, odourless, greenish, blood-tinged
pus. Infection in cattle is reported most frequently in Israel
and manifests as lymphadenitis and lymphangitis with
abscess formation and ulceration. Houseflies are thought to
play a role in dissemination of the organism. Less
commonly, mastitis and a clinical syndrome involving
lesions of the coronary band with resulting lameness in
affected dairy cattle have been reported (Steinman et al.,
1999; Yeruham et al., 2004).
Diagnosis is based on isolation and identification of C.
pseudotuberculosis from lesions, since lymphangitis can
also result from infection with other pyogenic bacteria.
Systemic antibiotic therapy may be combined with topical
treatment using an iodophor shampoo. Affected animals
 o      
disinfected.
Bovine pyelonephritis
Organisms belonging to the C. renale group can be
isolated from the vulva, vagina and prepuce of apparently
normal cattle. The stress of parturition and the short
559
urethra in the cow predispose to infection of the urinary
tract. Although infection by any member of the group can
cause cystitis, the most severe form is associated with C
cystitidis. Ascending infection from the bladder through
the ureters can result in pyelonephritis. Clinical signs of
pyelonephritis include fever, anorexia and decreased milk
production. Restlessness and kicking at the abdomen may
indicate renal pain. Dysuria, an arched back and
blood-tinged urine are invariably present. Long-standing
infections lead to extensive renal damage.
Diagnosis
· Clinical signs may suggest urinary tract disease.
·Thickened ureters and enlarged kidneys may be detected by
rectal palpation. The condition is often unilateral.
· Red blood cells and protein are present in the urine.
· Culture of C. renale from urinary deposits, in association
with characteristic clinical signs, is confirmatory.
Treatment
Antibiotic therapy, based on susceptibility testing, must be
instituted early in the disease and should be continued for
at least 3 weeks. Because penicillin is excreted in the
urine, treatment with this antibiotic is
particularly effective for susceptible isolates. Following a
review of 17 cases Braun et al. (2008) considered
unilateral nephrectomy to be the treatment of choice if
pyelonephritis is unilateral and severe.
Ulcerative balanoposthitis
560
Ulcerative (enzootic)balanoposthitis ((pizzle rot'),
particularly common in Merino sheep and Angora goats, is
caused by C. renale and is characterized by ulceration
around the preputial orifice, with a brownish crust
developing over the lesion. Similar lesions sometimes
occur on the vulva in ewes. Corynebacterium renale can

irritation and ulceration. A high urinary urea level, a
consequence of high protein intake, may predispose to the
development  of disease.   Animals 
 grazingpastures
containing high oestrogen levels are also prone to the
condition. Castrated sheep are affected more frequently
than rams. A heavy wool or mohair cover around the
prepuce predisposes to infection. Untreated cases may
progress to total occlusion of the preputial orifice.

Rhodococcus equi
Rhodococcus equi ormerly called Corynebacterium equi, is
a Gram-positive, aerobic, soil saprophyte which occurs
worldwide. It is an opportunistic pathogen of foals under 6
months of age. Rhodococcus equi grows on non-enriched
media such as nutrient agar and produces characteristic
mucoid  salmon-pink
colonies,
features indicativeof
capsule formation and pigment production. Some strains of
R. equi appear as cocci and others as rods up to 5 μ m in
length
(Fig.18.1).
The  organism
is  non-motile,
catalase-positive, oxidase-negative and weakly acid-fast. It
is taxonomically related to Nocardia and Mycobacterium
species; all three genera are classified in the order
Actinomycetales. The acid-fast properties of R. equi, its
ability to grow intracellularly and production of lung
lesions are further evidence of its relationship with
Mycobacterium species. The complete genome sequence
of the organism is available online (Muscatello et al.,
2007).
Usual habitat
Rhodococcus equi is an inhabitant of both soil and the
intestinal tracts of animals. It can replicate in soils
enriched with faeces of herbivores at warm temperatures
and is present in the soil of most equine establishments.
Clinical infections
565
Suppurative bronchopneumonia of foals is  the major
disease caused by this pyogenic organism. Superficial
abscesses due to R. equi have been recorded in horses over
6 months of age. Infected pigs develop a granulomatous
lymphadenitis involving the cervical lymph nodes, and
disease has been recorded on rare occasions in most other
domestic species (Table 18.1).
. Associated with the
increasing  number 
of humans infected with  human
immunodeficiency
virus
worldwide,
 opportunistic
infection with R. equi has become a disease of
considerable importance in human medicine.

Suppurative bronchopneumonia of foals
This important disease of foals, 1 to 4 months of age, is
characterized
by
bronchopneumonia
 and
lung
abscessation.
Epidemiology
Infection is generally acquired by inhalation of dust
contaminated with R. equi. The organism is often present
in large numbers in the faeces of healthy foals under 3
566
months of age and in extremely high numbers of those
with clinical disease. It can also be isolated from the faeces
of older horses and many other mammals and birds. Some
farms
smayhave
repeated problems with R. equi
pneumonia each year with disease recorded only rarely on
      
important in the occurrence of disease including factors
such as dry weather and poor grass cover on paddocks
leading to dusty conditions. High foal density and large
numbers of horses on farms are risk factors for disease. In
European countries   with
wet
temperate  climates,
acquisition of infection in dusty stables appears to be
important (Muscatello et al., 2006). Recent studies suggest
that clinically and subclinically affected foals may excrete
R. equi in aerosols (Muscatello et al., 2005). Thus,
infection may occur by contagion as well as through the
inhalation   of
organisms
with
 dust.   Granulomatous
ulcerative enterocolitis
sand
dmesentericlymphadenitis
sometimes occur when affected foals swallow sputum
containing large numbers of R. equi. Ingestion of low
numbers of organisms does not result in disease. Because
the immunological competence of foals progresses as they
mature, foals over 6 months of age appear to be refractory
to pulmonary infection.

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
The virulence of R. equi, an intracellular pathogen, is
principally associated with a large plasmid. This plasmid
contains genes that encode a number of proteins associated
with virulence, the most important of which is the vapA
protein. Only virulent strains of R. equi are isolated from
lesions   of  naturally infected
1  foals 
and thus these
virulence-associated proteins and plasmids can be used as
epidemiological markers. Characterization of isolates from
different animal species using a plasmid typing scheme has
shown definite associations between particular plasmid
568
types and individual animal species (Ocampo-Sosa et al.,
2007). Only equine isolates appear to be positive for the
vapA gene. Virulence is associated with an ability to
survive  and multiply
within
macrophages
through
interference with endosomal maturation and prevention of
acidification of the vacuole in which the organism is
found. Other factors enhancing virulence include capsular
polysaccharides and mycolic acids in the cell wall which
retard phagocytosis, and also a variety of exoenzymes. The
particular susceptibility of foals under 4 months of age to
bronchopneumonia caused by this pathogen is attributed to
impaired cellular immunity in the lungs (Prescott et al.,
2004).
Clinical signs
Clinical signs vary with the age at which the foal becomes
infected. Acute disease often occurs in 1-month-old foals.
with sudden onset of fever, anorexia and signs of
bronchopneumonia. The disease tends to be insidious in
foals 2 to 4 months old, and lesions can be well advanced
before the animal exhibits coughing, dyspnoea, weight
loss, exercise intolerance and characteristic loud, moist
rales on auscultation of the lungs. Affected foals may
occasionally have diarrhoea.
Diagnosis
Although clinical signs and findings on auscultation are
highly suggestive of R. equi infection in foals affected by
the classical form of the disease, it is important to diagnose
the disease before clinical signs are evident as by that stage
serious lung damage will have occurred. Thus, monitoring

of foals on farms with a history of R. equi infection is
frequently undertaken.

aspirates and pus from lesions.
 Cytological examination of respiratory secretions is useful as

supports a diagnosis of R. equi infection.
· Blood agar and MacConkey agar plates inoculated with
suspect material are incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 to
48 hours. Sensitivity of culture is low and is attributed to the
intracellular location of organisms (Muscatello et af., 2007)

- Absence of growth on MacConkey agar

 Supportive therapy includes rehydration and the use of

Control
·Commercial vaccines are not available
 On farms where the disease has occurred, foals should be
kept under observation and examined clinically twice
weekly until they are 4 months of age.
·Recent studies have shown that the level of virulent R. equi
 present in the environment of foals is not directly related to
the prevalence of disease and may not be important if the
571
organisms remain bound to the soil and cannot be inhaled
(Muscatello et af., 2007; Cohen et af., 2008). However,
prevention of exposure of foals to aerosols of R. equi is
desirable.
·Dusty conditions in paddocks and holding yards should be
of good grass cover.
· The numbers of foals kept together in paddocks or yards
should be reduced in order to limit the generation of aerosols
in dry weather. In addition, keeping smaller numbers of foals
together limits foal-to-foal spread of infection although the
relative importance of this route of infection has not been
determined.

Gram-positive,
coccobacillary rods, up to 2 μ m in length (Fig. 19.1). They

has been implicated worldwide in diseases of many animal
species and humans. It was first isolated from laboratory
rabbits with septicaemia and monocytosis (Murray et al..
1926). The organism can grow over a wide temperature
range from 4°C to 45°C and can tolerate pH values
between 5.5 and 9.6. The clinicalmanifestations of
infections with Listeria species are summarized in Table
19.1. Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogen mainly of
ruminants as is L. ivanovii, although the latter is less
frequently implicated in diseases of animals. Listeria
monocytogenes is of major public health significance and
infects humans via contaminated food and occasionally by
direct contact. Listeria innocua is usually regarded as non -
pathogenic but it has been isolated from sheep with
meningoencephalitis on rare occasions.
Usual habitat
Listeria species can replicate in the environment. They are
widely distributed and can be recovered from herbage
faeces of healthy animals, sewage effluent and bodies of
fresh water.

monocytogenes are recognized (Murray et al., 2007).
· Phage typing is reproducible and discriminating but its
diagnostic applications are limited as some strains are not
typable.
Molecular methods are commonly used for strain typing of
L. monocytogenes. Digestion of nucleic acid using restriction
endonucleases followed by PFGE is a widely recognized
576
method of typing. The Center for Disease Control (CDC)
PulseNet public health laboratories utilize a standardized
 protocol which permits inter-laboratory comparison of PFGE
patterns via the internet. Other methods of typing include
amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), random
amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, and  repetitive
extragenic palindro-mic element - based PCR (REP-PCR).
Allof these techniques have good discriminatory ability
(Fonnesbech Vogel et al., 2004 ; Chou and Wang, 2006).
Many of the methods currently available for the isolation
and differentiation of Listeria organisms have been reviewed

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Infection with L. monocytogenes usually follows ingestion
of contaminated feed and may result in septicaemia.
encephalitis or abortion. Organisms penetrate the intestine
by a mechanism that is not well defined. Spread occurs via
lymph and blood to various tissues. In pregnant animals,
infection results in transplacental transmission. There is
evidence that the organism can invade through breaks in
the oral or nasal mucosa. It is thought that the organism
may penetrate via the dental pulp when sheep are cutting
or losing teeth (Barlow and McGorum, 1985). From this
site, migration in cranial nerves is thought to be the main
route of infection in neural listeriosis. Lesions in the brain
stem, often unilateral, are composed of microabscesses and
perivascular lymphocytic cuffs.
Listeria monocytogenes has the ability to invade both
phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, to survive and
replicate intracellularly and to transfer from cell to cell
withoutexposure
eto humoral defence mechanisms.
Specific surface proteins, intermalins, facilitate both the
adherence of organisms to epithelial cells of the host and
their subsequent uptake by these cells. Phagocytosis by
       
lipoteichoic acid of the Gram-positive cell wall of the
578
Listeria organism (Flannagan et al., 2009). Survival of
virulent strains within cells is by means of escape from the
phagosome before its maturation to a phagolysosome. The
actionofa
cytolytic
toxin,
listeriolysin,  and
a
phospholipase  enzymedestroys  t
the membranes of
phagocytic vacuoles allowing Listeria to escape into the
cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, an actin-polymerizing
protein, ActA, produced by the organism, directs the
formation of tail-like 
structures from host cellular
microfilaments which aid the motility of the invading
pathogens. The motile Listeria contact the internal surface
of the cytoplasmic membrane and induce pseudopod-like
projections. These projections, containing the bacteria, are
taken up by adiacent cells. The entire process is then
repeated following replication of Listeria in newly infected
cells (Chakraborty and Wehland, 1997). Replication within
cells is facilitated by expression of genes which allow the
organism to utilize nutrients present within the host cell.
Listeria monocytogenes survives within cells in part
because of its ability to escape the phagosome but also
because of its ability to inhibit autophagy, by mechanisms
Autophagy occurs as a normal part of the growth and
development of a cell and involves the catabolism of
normal cell components through the lysosomal machinery.
The role of autophagy is to maintain cellular homeostasis
through   the   degradation   and
recycling of cellular
components. However, 1t may also play a role in protection
against infection by intracellular organisms such as

Clinical infections
Infections with L. monocytogenes have been recorded in
more than 40 species of domestic and wild animals.
Sporadic abortions in sheep and cattle have been attributed
to infection with L. ivanovii. Listeria innocua has been
implicated in a case of ovine meningoencephalitis (Walker
et al., 1994). Forms of listeriosis that occur in domestic
animals are listed in Table 19.1.
Listeriosis in ruminants
Listeriosis in ruminants may present as encephalitis.
abortion, septicaemia or endophthalmitis. Usually only one
form of the disease occurs in a group of affected animals.
Septicaemia, often encountered in newborn piglets, foals.
cage birds and poultry, can also occur in adult sheep.
Although L. monocytogenes is widely distributed in the
environment, outbreaks of listeriosis tend to be seasonal in
European countries and to affect silage-fed animals in late
pregnancy. Listeria monocytogenes can replicate in the
surface layers of poor-quality silage with pH values above
5.5. In such circumstances, liste-rial numbers may reach
580
107colony-forming units kg-l of silage. In good quality
silage, multiplication of the organisms is inhibited by the
acid produced by fermentation. Susceptibility to infection
with L. monocy-togenes has been attributed to decreased
cell -  mediated  immunity  associated   with  advanced
pregnancy.
Clinical signs
The incubation period  of neural listeriosis (circling
disease) ranges from 14 to 40 days. Dullness, circling and
tilting of the head are common clinical signs. Unilateral
facial paralysis results in drooling of saliva and drooping
of the eyelid and ear. Exposure keratitis may occur in some
cases. Body temperature may be elevated in the early
stages of the disease. In sheep and goats, recumbency and
death may follow within a few days of the emergence of
clinical signs. The duration of illness is usually longer in
cattle. Abortion without evidence of systemic illness may
occur up to 12 days after infection. Septicaemic listeriosis,
with a short incubation period of 2 to 3 days, is most
commonly encountered in lambs although it may occur
occasionally in pregnant sheep. In cattle and sheep,
keratoconjunctivitis  and   iritis (ocular  listeriosis) are
localized and often unilateral, and have been attributed to
direct ocular contact with contaminated silage.
Diagnosis
 Characteristic neurological signs or abortion in association
with silage feeding may suggest listeriosis.
 Appropriate specimens for laboratory examination depend
on the form of the disease:
581
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tissue from the medulla and
pons of animals with neurological signs should be sampled.
Fresh tissue is required for isolation of organisms and fixed
tissue forhistopathological examination.
-Specimens from cases of abortion should include
cotyledons, foetal abomasal contents and uterine discharges.
- Suitable samples from septicaemic cases include fresh
liver or spleen and blood.
Smears from cotyledons or from liver lesions may reveal
Gram-positive coccobacillary bacteria.
·Immunofluorescence, using monoclonal antibodies, may
facilitate a rapid diagnosis.
·Histological
examination   of  brain  tissue  reveals
microabscesses and heavy perivascular mononuclear cuffing
in the medulla and elsewhere in the brain stem.
·White cell numbers exceeding 1.2 × 10/ litre
 and a protein
concentration of greater than 0.4 g litre
TM1 in CSF are found
in neural listeriosis.
· Isolation methods:
- Specimens from cases of abortion and septicaemia can be
inoculated directly on to blood agar, selective blood agar and
MacConkey agar. The plates are incubated aerobically at
37°C for 24 to 48 hours.
organism from brain tissue. Small pieces of medulla are
homogenized and a 10% suspension is made in nutrient
broth. The suspension is held at 4°C in a refrigerator and
subcultured weekly on to blood agar for up to 12 weeks
·Identification criteria for L. monocytogenes isolates:
- Colonies are small, smooth and flat with a bluegreen
colour when illuminated obliquely. Rough variants occur
infrequently. Individual colonies are usually surrounded by a
narrow zone of complete haemolysis.
582
- Catalase test is positive, distinguishing this organism from
similar colonies but are catalase-negative.
- CAMP test is positive with Staphylococcus aureus but not
with Rhododoccus equi (Table 19.2).
-- Aesculin is hydrolysed.

a characteristic tumbling motility.
- Most isolates of animal origin are virulent, a characteristic
that can be confirmed by animal inoculation. Instillation of a

keratoconjunctivitis (Anton test).
·Molecular methods have been developed for the detection of
methods are more rapid than cultural procedures and are
frequently more sensitive. The methods used are usually
based on PCR and include commercially available PCR
systems.
Treatment
Ruminants in the early stages of septicaemic listeriosis
respond to systemic therapy with ampicillin or amoxicillin.
Response to antibiotic therapy may be poor in neural
listeriosis although prolonged high doses of ampicillin or
amoxicillin  combined with an aminoglycoside may be
effective. Reports differ as to the effectiveness of different
treatments. Braun et al. (2002) reported that a gentamicin/
ampicillin combination was most effective for  the
treatment of sheep and goats whereas Schweizer et al.
(2006) found no differences between penicillin G,
oxytetracycline, amoxicil-lin or amoxicillin combined with
583
gentamicin when treating a number of cases of listeriosis
in cattle. Ocular listeriosis requires treatment with
antibiotics and corticosteroids injected sub-conjunctivally
Cepha-losporins are not effective in the treatment of
Listeria infections in animals or humans.
Control
·Poor-quality silage should not be fed to pregnant ruminants.
Silage feeding should be discontinued if an outbreak of
listeriosis is confirmed.
·Feeding methods which minimize direct ocular contact with
silage should be implemented.
·Vaccination with killed vaccines, which do not induce an
effective cell-mediated response, is not protective because L.
monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogen. Although
monocytogenes, they do not confer immunity to infection
Neutrophils are important  in protection against listerial
infection but cell-mediated immunity involving activation of
macrophages by IFN -y released from T-helper cells has
long been considered the principal method of protection.
However, as multiplication of L. monocytogenes occurs in
hepatocytes and other cells, the achievement of complete
immunity  must  require  additional  defence  mechanisms
which have not yet been fully elucidated. Live, attenuated
vaccines, which are available in some countries, are reported
to reduce the prevalence of listeriosis in sheep (Gudding et
al., 1989). Subunit vaccines are under investigation and may
induce protection if combined with effective adjuvants.
Human listeriosis
If normal healthy adults acquire infection, the disease
usually presents as a mild febrile illness resembling
influenza. Papular lesions on the hands and arms,
principally in veterinarians and farmers, can result from
584
contact with infective material. Infection withL.
monocytogenes can lead to abortion in pregnant women
and can be life-threatening in neonates, the elderly and
immunosuppressed individuals.
Human infections usually result from consumption of
contaminated food such as raw milk, soft cheeses,
coleslaw  and uncooked vegetables. Because of its
intracellular localization and tolerance to heat, Listeria
monocytogenes may survive pasteurization. Direct transfer

Usual habitat
588
It is claimed that up to 50% of healthy pigs harbour E.
rhusiopathiae in tonsillar tissues. Carrier pigs excrete the
organism in faeces and in oronasal secretions. The
bacterium has also been isolated from sheep, cattle, horses,
dogs, cats and poultry and from 50 species of wild
mammals and over 30 species of wild birds. Although soil
and surface water can become contaminated with E.
rhusiopathiae, survival time in soil probably does not
exceed 35 days under optimal conditions. The bacterium is
often present in the slime layer of fish, a potential source
of human infection.

and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis

Of E. rhusiopathiae strains.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Infection is usually acquired by ingestion of material
contaminated by pig faeces. Entry may occur through the
tonsils, skin or mucous membranes. Virulence factors
include a capsule which protects the organism against
to protect the organism within macrophages, allowing
intracellular   replication.
'The

neuraminidase is correlated to virulence; this enzyme plays
a major role in adherence of the organism to endothelial
cells
 and    subsequent    invasion
ofthese
cells
neuraminic (sialic) acid which is found on body cell
surfaces. Other factors that contribute to the pathogenicity
of E. rhusiopathiae include surface proteins which aid
adherence to tissues and  biofilm  formation.A
hyaluronidase enzyme is important in dissemination of the
592
bacteria within tissues. The spaA protein, found on the cell
surface, is a major protective antigen used in vaccine
development.  Antibodies against
 recombinant spaA
protein were shown to greatly enhance the opsonic activity
of porcine neutrophils against the organism (Imada et al.,
1999). In the septicaemic form of the disease, vascular
damage is characterized by swelling of endothelial cells,
adherence of monocytes to vascular walls and widespread
hyaline microthrombus  formation.  Localization of the
bacteria in joint synovia and on heart valves during
haematogenous spread accounts for the development of
chronic lesions at these sites. Long-term articular damage
may result from an immune response to
persistent bacterial antigens. Viable E. rhusiopathiae are
rarely isolated from chronically affected joints.
Clinical infections
Infections with E. rhusiopathiae are encountered in pigs.
turkeys and sheep (Box 20.1). In addition, several major
outbreaks of disease have been reported  in poultry
(Mazaheri et al., 2005). Other domestic animals are
occasionally affected.
Swine erysipelas
Subclinically infected carrier pigs are the main reservoir of
organisms in faeces. Organisms are also excreted in urine.
saliva and nasal discharges. Infection is usually acquired
through ingestion of contaminated food or water and less
commonly through minor skin abrasions. In pigs kept
593
outdoors, repeated faecal contamination of the soil occurs
and may represent a source of infection.
The susceptibility of individual pigs and the virulence of
the E. rhusiopathiae strain, both of which are highly
variable, determine the course and outcome of infection
Pigs under 3 months of age are normally protected by
maternally-derived antibodies while animals over 3 years
of age usually have acquired a protective active immunity
through exposure to strains of low virulence. Stress factors
appear to be important in the occurrence of disease, with
acute cases frequently observed following sudden changes
in weather, transport or weaning.
Clinical signs
Swine erysipelas can occur in four forms. The septicaemic
and cutaneous ('diamond') forms are acute while arthritis
and vegetative endocarditis are chronic forms of the
disease. Chronic arthritis has the most significant negative
impact on productivity.
Septicaemia occurs after an incubation period of 2 to 3
days. During an outbreak of acute disease, some pigs may
be found dead and others are febrile, depressed and walk
with a stiff, stilted gait or remain recumbent. Mortality
may be high in some outbreaks. Pregnant sows with the
septicaemic form of disease may abort.
In the diamond-skin form, systemic signs are less severe
 sn     a s  p
septicaemia. Pigs are febrile, and cutaneous lesions
progress from small, light pink or purple, raised areas to
594
more    extensive   and   characteristic   diamond-shaped
erythematous plaques. Some of these lesions resolve
within a week; others become necrotic and may slough.
Arthritis, which is commonly encountered in older pigs,
can present as stiffness, lameness or reluctance to bear
weight on affected limbs. Joint lesions, which may be
initially mild, can progress to erosion of articular cartilage
witheventualfibrosis and ankylosis.Erysipelothrix
rhusiopathiae is one of the most frequently detected causes
of non-suppurative arthritis in pigs at slaughter (Hariharan
et al., 1992; Buttenschon et al., 1995 ). In vegetative
endocarditis, the least common form, wart-like thrombotic
masses are present, usually on the mitral valves. Many
affected animals are asymptomatic but some may develop
congestive heart failure or die suddenly if stressed by
physical exertion or by pregnancy.
Diagnosis
· Diamond-shaped skin lesions are pathognomonic.
Specimens for laboratory examination include blood for
haemoculture and post-mortem specimens of liver, spleen,
heart valves or synovial tissues. Organisms are rarely
recovered from skin lesions or chronically affected joints.
· Microscopic examination of specimens from acutely affected
animals may reveal slender Gram-positive rods. Filamentous

-- Appearance in Gram-stained smears from colonies
- Negative catalase test
-- Coagulase production
- H2 S production in TSI agar slants
- Biochemical test profile
·Serological tests are not applicable for diagnosis.
·Several PCR-based methods for the detection of E.
Shimoji et af. (1998) reported a PCR-based method for the
detection of virulent E. rhusiopathiae isolates. This method
utilized a selective enrichment broth for incubation of
samples prior to the PCR procedure, in order to improve
sensitivity of detection. In addition, PCR methods have been
used to investigate the occurrence of Erysipelothrix
species in abattoir and meat samples (Wang et al., 2002).
Treatment
Both penicillin and tetracyclines are effective for treatment
although resistance to tetracyclines has been reported in
some countries (Yamamoto et al., 2o01). When chronic
lesions have developed, antibiotic therapy is ineffective.
Control
· Hygiene and management practices should be evaluated and,
where necessary, brought to a satisfactory standard.
· Chronically affected animals should be culled
· Affected pigs should be isolated.
596
·Both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are available
Attenuated vaccines can be given orally, systemically or by

rhusiopathiae strains isolated in Japan using randomly
amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and
concluded that 37% of the chronic cases of erysipelas
detected over an ll-year period had occurred as a side effect
of vaccine use.
Erysipelas in fowl
Erysipelas in turkeys is an important disease worldwide
and birds of all ages are susceptible. Toms may excrete the
organisms in their semen and turkey hens may die
suddenly within 4 to 5 days of artificial insemination. The
disease usually presents as a septicaemia and mortality
rates may be high. Dark-coloured, swollen snoods are
characteristic of the disease. Post-mortem findings include
enlarged friable livers and spleens. Chronically affected
birds may exhibit arthritis and vegetative endocarditis and
they gradually  lose weight and become emaciated.
Vaccination  with  an  inactivated   vaccine  stimulates
protective immunity.
Erysipelas in chickens can cause outbreaks of severe
disease occasionally, with mortality rates of up to 50%
(Mazaheri et al., 2005 ). It is suggested that the red poultry
mite ( Dermanyssus gallinae ) may serve as a reservoir and
vector for the organism as PFGE banding patterms of
isolates  recovered  from poultry  and  mites   were
indistinguishable (Chirico et al., 2003; Eriksson et al.,
2009).

Infections in sheep
Non-suppurative polyarthritis of lambs may result from
entry of organisms through the navel or, more commonly.
through  docking or  castration  wounds.  Post-dipping
lameness, which affects older lambs and adult sheep, is
due to cellulitis and laminitis. The organism enters through
skin abrasions in the region of the hoof from heavily
contaminated dipping solutions. Valvular endocarditis and
pneumonia in ewes, associated with E. rhusiopathiae, have
also been reported (Griffiths et al., 1991).
Human erysipeloid
Many human infections with E. rhusiopathiae are
occupational in origin. Workers engaged in the fish and
poultry    industries
  and   other  agriculturally-based
occupations may be at risk of acquiring infection.
Organisms enter through minor skin abrasions causing a
localized cellulitis referred to as erysipeloid (Mutalib et
al., 1993 ). Rarely, extension by haematogenous spread in
untreated patients can lead to joint and heart involvement.

non-pathogenic species are Gram-negative, and organisms
in smears prepared from old cultures decolorize readily. In
smears from tissues or cultures, cells occur singly, in pairs
or in long chains (Fig. 21.1). The genus is comprised of
more than 200
species with

clinical  specimens
and
1laboratory
media.Bacillus
anthracis is the most important pathogen in the group. The
name Clostridium piliforme has been proposed for Bacillus
piliformis, the agent of Tyzzer's disease (Duncan et al.,
1993). Bacillus larvae, a major pathogen of bees, has been
reclassifiedasPaenibacillus
larvaesubsp.larvae
(Genersch et al., 2006).
Usual habitat
Bacillus species are widely distributed in the environment.
mainly because they produce highly resistant endospores.
In soil, endospores of B. anthracis can survive for more
than 50 years. Some Bacillus species can tolerate
extremely adverse conditions such as desiccation, high
temperatures and chemical disinfectants.

Differentiation of Bacillus species
The ability to grow aerobically and to produce catalase
distinguishes Bacillus species from the clostridia, which
are
also
 Gram-positive,  endospore-forming  rods.
Phenotypic differentiation of Bacillus species is largely
based on colonial characteristics and biochemical tests.
Many species, including B. anthracis, do not produce
capsules when grown on laboratory media. Taxonomic
studies based on genome sequencing data show that B.
anthracis, B. cereus and B. thuringiensis are closely
related, and these organisms, in addition to three other
species, make up what is informally referred to as the ^B.
cereus group’(Amesen et al., 2008). The presence of
specific virulence genes on plasmids and the mechanisms
by which these virulence genes are regulated are the
principal differentiating features of these species (Armesen
et al., 2008; Kolsto et al., 2009)
603
Figure 21.1 Rods of Bacillus species in chain formation.
Endospores appear as unstained areas within the cells.
·Colonial characteristics of Bacillus species which are
 pathogenic for animals and humans:
-Bacillus cereus colonies are similar to those of B.
anthracis but are slightly larger with a greenish tinge. The
majority of strains produce a wide zone of complete
haemolysis around the colonies. Because they have some
similar characteristics, B. anthracis and B. cereus require
careful differentiation (Table 21.1).
- Bacillus anthracis colonies are up to 5 mm in diameter,
flat, dry, greyish and with a ‘ground glass’ appearance
after incubation for 48 hours. At low magnification, curled
outgrowths from the edge of the colony impart a
characteristic, ‘medusa head’ appearance. Rarely, isolates
are weakly haemolytic.
- Bacillus licheniformis colonies are dull, rough, wrinkled
and strongly adherent to the agar. Characteristic hair-like
outgrowths are produced from streaks of the organisms on
agar media. Colonies become brown with age. The name
604
of this species derives from the similarity of its colonies to
lichen.
·Commercial biochemical test kitsfor confirming the identity
of Bacillus species are available.
Confirmation of identity and virulence of B. anthracis can be
made by detection of its two virulence plasmids using
PCR-based techniques (Anon., 2008).
All B. anthracis isolates fall into a single clonal group but
high resolution molecular typing techniques such as
multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis
(MLVA) can differentiate three phylogenetic branches A, B
and C (Kolsto et al., 2009). These lineages differ in
 geographical distribution, although lineage A is widely
dispersed throughout the world (Simonson et al., 2009).

605
emerging pathogen as a cause of abortion in cattle and
sheep. Bacillus cereus is important in human food
poisoning and may cause an emetic or diarrhoeal
syndrome. It is occasionally associated with cases of
mastitis in cows.
Infections with Bacillus licheniformis
Bacillus licheniformis, an organism widespread in the
environment and associated with food spoilage, has
recently been recognized as a cause of abortion in cattle
and sheep. On some farms in Britain, multiple bovine
abortions have been attributed to infection with B.
licheniformis. In 2006 in the UK, a diagnosis of B.
licheniformis infection was made in 21% of abortion cases
association with the feeding of silage or mouldy hay has
been suggested. Because this organism is ubiquitous, it is
only of diagnostic significance when isolated in heavy,
pure culture from foetal abomasal contents.

Anthrax
Anthrax is a severe disease that affects virtually all
mammalian species including humans. The disease, which
occurs worldwide, is endemic in some countries and in
defined regions of other countries. Ruminants are highly
susceptible, often developing a rapidly fatal septicaemic
form of the disease. Pigs and horses are moderately
susceptible to infection，
while
carnivores
are
comparatively resistant. Birds are almost totally resistant
to infection, a characteristic attributed to their relatively
high body temperatures.
Epidemiology
Endospore formation is the most important factor in the
nutrient depletion and
[ other
r   adverse environmental
conditions. The endospores of B. anthracis can survive for
decades in soil. Spores may become concentrated in some
geographically  defined  regions 
where soil conditions
favour spore survival. Soils in such regions are alkaline
and rich in calcium and nitrogen, and have a high moisture
content. In addition, repeated cycles of flooding and
607
evaporation may concentrate spores in particular low-lying
locations (Dragon and Rennie, 1995). The increased
survival of spores in alkaline calcium-rich soils is because
of the important role of calcium in the core of the spore.
Calcium, in combination with dipicolinic acid, forms a
lattice that stabilizes the DNA and enzymes in the core and
ensures spore survival. Leaching of calcium from the
spore, which may occur in calcium-poor environments,
impairs spore survival. Outbreaks of anthrax in herbivores
can occur when pastures are contaminated by spores
originating from buried carcasses. Spores may be brought
to the surface by flooding, excavation, subsidence, or the
activity ofearthworms.
Sporadic outbreaks of the disease have been associated
with the importation of contaminated meat-and-bone meal,
fertilizers of animal origin, and hides. Infection is usually
acquired by ingestion of spores and, less commonly, by
inhalation or through skin abrasions. Although carnivores
are comparatively resistant to infection, the ingestion of
large numbers of B. anthracis from an anthrax carcass can
produce disease.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
The virulence of B. anthracis derives from the presence of
a capsule and the ability to produce a complex toxin. Both
virulence factors are encoded by plasmids and are required
for disease production. The plasmid PXOl encodes the
three components which form two exotoxins; the genes
that regulate their expression are also found on the
plasmid. The genes encoding capsule production and their
regulators are found on plasmid PXO2. The expression of
608
virulence factors is regulatedbv a number of variables
including
host
temperature
 and
carbon
dioxide
concentration.
The
capsule,
composed
of
poly--D-glutamic acid,
 inhibits  phagocytosis.
The
complex toxin consists of three antigenic components:
protective antigen, oedema factor and lethal factor.
Individually    each
  factor
lacks toxic activity in
experimental animals, although protective antigen induces
antibodies  which  confer partial immunity.  Protective
antigen acts as the binding moiety for both oedema factor
and lethal factor. Oedema factor is a calmodulin-dependent
adenylate cyclase, and once it has entered cells following
binding to protective antigen, it causes increased levels of
cyclic AMP. The
resultant
disturbance ofwater
homeostasis causes the fluid accumulation seen in clinical
disease. Neutrophils are the principal target of oedema
factor which severely inhibits their
function. Lethal toxin consists of lethal factor, a zinc
metalloprotease and protective antigen which acts as the
binding domain as for oedema factor. It causes the death of
macrophages and other cells including dendritic cells,
neutrophils and some epithelial and endothelial cells. In
naturally occurring disease, local effects of the complex
toxin include swelling and darkening of tissues due to
oedema and necrosis. When septicaemia occurs, increased
vascular permeability and extensive haemorrhage lead to
shock and rapid death
Clinical signs and pathology
The incubation period of anthrax ranges from hours to
days. The clinical presentation and pathological changes
609
vary with the species affected, the challenge dose and the
route of infection.
In cattle and sheep, the disease is usually septicaemic and
rapidly fatal. Although most animals are found dead
without premonitory signs, pyrexia with temperatures up
to 42°C (108°F), depression, congested mucosae and
petechiae may be observed ante mortem. Animals that
survive for more than a day may abort or display
subcutaneous  oedema
and
dysentery.Incattle,
post-mortem findings include rapid bloating, incomplete
rigor mortis, widespread ecchymotic haemorrhages and
oedema, dark, unclotted blood and blood-stained fluid in
body cavities. An extremely large soft spleen
is
characteristic of the disease in cattle. Splenomegaly and
oedema are less prominent post-mortem features in
affected sheep, which are reported to be more susceptible
than cattle and succumb more rapidly.
In pigs, infection generally results in oedematous swelling
of the throat and head along with regional lymphadenitis.
If oedema in the laryngeal region does not interfere with
breathing,  affected
dpigsmaysurvive.Intestinal
involvement manifests clinically as dysentery due to
multifocal, haemorrhagic enteric lesions. Mortality rates
may be high.
The clinical course of anthrax in horses is often prolonged
for several days. Following introduction of spores into
abrasions, extensive subcutaneous oedema of the thorax,
abdomen or legs may develop. Swelling of the pharynx.
similar to that in pigs, has been described. Less commonly.
colic and dysentery due to severe haemorrhagic enteritis
610
may result from ingestion of spores. If septicaemia occurs,
extensive ecchymoses and splenomegaly are found post
mortem.
In dogs, which are rarely affected, the course of the disease
and pathological  changes resemble those observed  in
affected pigs.

appear in a thin blood smear. When stained with
polychrome methylene blue, the blue-staining organisms
are surrounded by pink capsules (M'Fadyean reaction)
Diagnosis
Carcasses of animals that have died from anthrax are
bloated, putrefy rapidly and do not exhibit rigor mortis.
Dark, unclotted blood may issue from the mouth, nostrils
and anus. The carcasses of such animals should not be
opened because this will facilitate sporulation, with the risk
of long-term environmental contamination.
 Peripheral blood from the tail vein of ruminants or peritoneal
fluid from pigs should be collected into a sterile syringe.
Cotton wool soaked in 70% alcohol should be applied to the
site after collection to minimize leakage of contaminated
611
blood or fluid. Thin smears of blood or fluid, stained with
polychrome methylene blue, reveal chains of square-ended,
blue-staining rods surrounded by pink capsules (Fig. 21.2).
The amount of capsular material diminishes with time after
the death of the animal.
· Culture and isolation are regarded as the gold standard for
diagnosis of disease. Blood agar and MacConkey agar are
inoculated  with  the suspect specimens and incubated
aerobically at 37°C for 24 to 48 hours.

- Colonial morphology
- Microscopic appearance in a Gram-stained smear

detection of B. anthracis DNA in deteriorating or stored
samples (Berg et al., 2006).
· The Ascoli test is a thermoprecipitation test designed to
detect antigens of B. anthracis in biological materials such
as hides. Homogenized material is boiled and clarified by
filtration. The filtrate is used as the source of antigen in ring
precipitation or gel diffusion tests with B. anthracis
antiserum. This test lacks specificity because B. anthracis
shares thermostable antigens with other Bacilius species.
Agar gel immunodiffusion, complement fixation, ELISA and
immunofluorescence tests have been evaluated for the
612
diagnosis of anthrax, but they are either too insensitive or
lack the required specificity for routine use.
Treatment
If administered early in the course of the disease, high
doses of penicillin G or oxytetracycline may prove
effective. Although inducible β-lactamase production has
been demonstrated in B. anthracis isolates, naturally
occurring penicillin resistance in clinical isolates appears
to be rare (Shadomy and Smith, 2008).
Control
Suspected cases of anthrax must be reported immediately
to appropriate regulatory authorities. Control measures
should be designed to take account of the prevalence of
disease in a particular country or geographical region.
· In endemic regions:
- Annual vaccination, particularly of cattle and sheep, is
advisable. The Sterne strain spore vaccine should be given
about 1 month before anticipated outbreaks. The spores in
this live vaccine convert to non-encapsulated avirulent
vegetative organisms.
 Chemoprophylaxis, employing long-acting penicillin,
should be considered when outbreaks threaten valuable
livestock.
- Killed vaccines, which contain protective antigen as the
major protective component, are available for humans who
may be exposed to infection in the course of their work
613
· In non-endemic regions following a disease outbreak:
- Movement of animals, their waste products, feed and
bedding from affected and adjacent premises must be
prohibited.
- Personnel implementing control measures should wear
protective clothing and footwear which must be disinfected
before leaving the affected farm.
-Foot-baths containing sporicidal disinfectant (5%
formalin, or 3% peracetic acid) should be placed at
entrances to affected farms.
- Contaminated buildings should be sealed and fumigated
with formaldehyde before bedding is removed. Following
removal of bedding and loose fittings, all drains should be
blocked and the building should be sprayed with 5%
formalin which should be left to act for at least 10 hours
before final washing
- Immediate disposal of carcasses, bedding, manure,
fodder and other contaminated material is mandatory.
Carcasses should be incinerated or buried deeply away
from water courses. Contaminated material and equipment
must be disinfected with 1o% formalin or, if appropriate,
incinerated.
- Scavenger animals should not be allowed access to
suspect carcasses and insect activity should be minimized
by application of insecticides on and around carcasses.
- In-contact animals should be isolated and kept under
close observation for at least 2 weeks
614
Anthrax in humans
Anthrax in humans has been known from ancient times
and was thought to be one of the plagues of Egypt. Public
awareness of the disease has increased in recent years
S          
(Jernigan et al., 2001). Three main forms of the disease
occur in humans. Cutaneous anthrax (malignant pustule) is
the result of endospores entering abraded skin. This
localized lesion can progress to septicaemia if not treated.
Pulmonary anthrax
(woolsorters'
disease)follows
inhalation of spores, and intestinal anthrax results from
ingestion of infective material. The disease may prove fatal
in the absence of early treatment. The use of B. anthracis
as an agent of bioterrorism has greatly increased the
amount of research
1 conducted on this pathogen, in
particular, research into
diagnostic
techniques
and
vaccination. Approaches for improving currently available
vaccines include investigation of the use of adjuvants and
alternative delivery systems. Recombinant vaccines using
bacterial and viral vectors have been developed and some
products showed considerable promise (Friedlander and
Little, 2009).

Clostridium species
The clostridia are large, Gram-positive bacteria which are
fermentative, catalase-negative and oxidase-negative, and
B        
slightly curved rods and the majority are motile by flagella
which are peritrichous. Clostridium species produce
endospores which usually cause bulging of mother cells
(Fig. 22.1). The size, shape and location of endospores can
beusedforspecies
differentiation.  Although most
pathogenic clostridial species are strict anaerobes, some
are comparatively aerotolerant. Clostridia occur worldwide
and particular species may be associated with defined
geographical regions.
Although more than 1o0 clostridial species are recognized.
less than 20 are pathogenic. These pathogenic species can
be grouped in three categories, based on toxin activity and
tissues affected (Fig. 22.2). Clostridium tetani and C.
botulinum, the neurotoxic clostridia, affect neuromuscular
function without inducing observable tissue damage. In
contrast, histotoxic clostridia produce relatively localized
lesions in tissues such as muscle and liver and may
subsequently cause toxaemia. Clostridium perfringens
types A to E, important members of the third category,
produce inflammatory lesions in the gastrointestinal tract
along with enterotoxaemia. Clostridium difficile is an
emerging enteric pathogen of animals and is a significant
nosocomial pathogen of humans. Clostridium spiro-forme
causes diarrhoea in rabbits and C. colinum is an intestinal
618
pathogen of fowl. Clostridium piliforme, which causes
hepatic necrosis in foals, is an atypical member of the
clostridia and does not have characteristics that permit its
inclusion in any of the three categories described.

rapidly from the intestine into tissues, leading to difficulty
with the interpretation of laboratory results.
620
· Blocks of tissue or fluids from affected animals should be
laboratory. Specimens must be cultured promptly after
collection.
·Blood agar enriched with yeast extract, vitamin K and
haemin is suitable for the culture of clostridia. Media should
be freshly prepared or pre-reduced to ensure absence of
oxygen.
 Suitable atmospheric requirements are provided by culturing
in anaerobic jars containing hydrogen supplemented with 5
to 10% carbon dioxide to enhance growth. Some vegetative
clostridia may not survive exposure to the air for more than
15 minutes.
Detection and differentiation of clostridia
Apart from the use of cultural techniques, clostridia can be
demonstrated in clinical specimens by molecular and other
methods. PCR-based techniques have been developed for
demonstration of histotoxic clostridia in tissues (Sasaki et
al., 200l; Uzal et al., 2003) and fluorescent antibody
techniques are also widely used for the rapid identification
of these organisms in tissues.

Laboratory procedures for differentiating most clostridia
include colonial morphology, biochemical tests, toxin

identification of organic acids.
·Colonial morphology is of limited value for differentiating
most clostridial species. However, colonies of C. perfringens
are surrounded by a characteristic double-zone of
haemolysis.
· Miniaturized commercial kits are available for biochemical
identification.
·PCR techniques can be used for identification of clostridial
isolates and multiplex PCR tests have been developed for
differentiation of a number of different species. Sasaki et af.
(2002) found a multiplex PCR system, based on the flagellin
gene, useful for the differentiation of C. chauvoei, C.
haemolyticum, C. novyi types A and B, and C. septicum.
·Specific toxins can be identified in body fluids or in
intestinal contents by toxin neutralization or protection tests
in laboratory rodents, usually mice.
·Immunoassay methods such as ELISA can be used for toxin
detection. The polymerase chain reaction can be employed
for the detection of genes coding for toxin production in
isolates of C. botulinum. These tests have now replaced
many of the mouse bioassay tests but are not yet sufficiently
sensitive  and   specific  to  replace animal  tests  in  all
circumstances.
Clinical conditions caused by neurotoxic clostridia
The neurotoxic clostridia, C. tetani and C. botulinum,
produce their effects by elaborating potent neurotoxins.
The neurotoxin of C. tetani is produced by organisms
replicating locally in damaged tissues. Absorbed toxin
exerts its effect on synaptic junctions remote from the site
of toxin production. The neurotoxin of C. botulinum is
622
organic matter or in the anaerobic conditions in
contaminated cans of meat or vegetables. When absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream, the
toxin affects the functioning of neuromuscular junctions
Some features of the neurotoxins of C. tetani and C.
botulinum are presented in Table 22.1. The toxins of both
C. tetani and C. botulinum are similar in structure and
function. The differing clinical signs observed in each
disease can be explained by the differing sites of action of
the toxins produced by each organism.
Tetanus
Tetanus is an acute, potentially fatal intoxication which
affects many species including humans. However, species
susceptibility to toxin varies considerably. Horses and
humans are highly susceptible, ruminants and pigs
moderately so and carnivores are comparatively resistant.
Poultry are not susceptible to tetanus.
Clostridium tetani, the aetiological agent, is a straight
slender,  anaerobic,  Gram-positive  rod.  Spherical
endospores, which are terminal and bulge mother cells,
imparta characteristic‘drumstick' appearance to
sporulated organisms (Fig. 22.1). The endospores are
resistant to chemicals and boiling but are killed by
autoclaving at 121°C for 15 minutes. Clostridium tetani
has a swarming growth and is haemolytic on blood agar
due to the production of tetanolysin. Ten sero-logical types
of C. tetani can be distinguished by their flagellar antigens.
The neurotoxin, tetanospasmin, is antigenically uniform
irrespective of serotype, and antibodies induced by the
623
neurotoxin of any one of the serotypes neutralize the
neurotoxins produced by the others.

tissues when the haemolytic toxin, tetanolysin, is released.
Vegetative bacteria multiplying in necrotic tissues produce
624
the potent tetanospasmin which is responsible for the
clinical signs of tetanus.
Pathogenesis
Structurally, tetanus toxin consists of two chains joined by
the heavy chain is responsible for receptor binding and
internalization of the toxin.  The neurotoxin binds
irreversibly to ganglioside receptors on motor neuron
terminals and is transported to the nerve cell body and its
dendritic processes in the central nervous system in
toxin-containing vesicles, by retrograde intra-axonal flow.
Toxin is transferred trans-synaptically to its site of action
in the terminals of inhibitory neurons and enters these cells
by endocytosis. The low pH of the endosome induces a
conformational change in the neurotoxin which allows it to
penetrate the endosome membrane and form a pore (Cai
and Singh, 2007). Following this change, the light chain, a
zinc endopeptidase, enters the cytosol of the inhibitory
neuron  where it  blocks presynaptic transmission  of
inhibitory signals by hydrolysis of synaptobrevins, protein
components  of  vesicles   containing  neurotransmitters
(Sanford, 1995). As a consequence of this, the vesicles can
no longer dock on to the plasma membrane to release their
contents. Because release of inhibitory neurotransmitters is
prevented, spastic paralysis results. Toxin can also be
blood-bome, especially when produced in large amounts,
and can then bind to motor terminals throughout the body
prior to transfer to the central nervous system. Bound toxin
is not neutralized by antitoxin
Clinical signs
625
The incubation period of tetanus is usually between 5 and
10days but mayextendto3weeks. Whenthe
development of clinical signs is delayed, the wound at the
site of infection may have healed and the condition is then
referred to as latent tetanus. The clinical effects of the
neurotoxin are similar in all domestic animals. However,
the nature and severity of the clinical signs are dependent
on the anatomical site of the replicating bacteria, the
amount of toxin produced and species susceptibility.
Wounds on or near the head are usually associated with a
shorter incubation period and an increased tendency to
generalized tetanus. Localized tetanus, which usually
affects less susceptible species such as dogs, presents as
stiffness and spasm of muscles close to the site of injury as
a result of the effect of toxin on local nerve endings.
Clinical signs include stiffness, localized spasms, altered
heart and respiratory rates, dysphagia and altered facial
expression. Comparatively mild tactile or auditory stimuli
may precipitate tonic contraction of muscles. Spasm of
masticatory muscles may lead to lockjaw'. Generalized
muscle stiffness can result in a ‘saw-horse’ stance
especially in horses. Animals that recover from tetanus are
not necessarily immune because the amount of toxin that
can induce clinical disease is usually below the threshold
required to stimulate the production of neutralizing
antibodies.
Diagnostic procedures
The diagnosis of tetanus is usually presumptive and is
based on the clinical signs and a history of recent trauma in
unvaccinated animals.
626
· Differentiation from strychnine poisoning is necessary,
particularly in dogs. Gram-stained smears of material from
lesions may reveal the characteristic *drumstick' forms of C.
tetani (Fig. 22.1)
·Anaerobic culture of C. tetani from necrotic wound tissue
may be attempted but is often unsuccessful.
 PCR-based techniques, including real-time PCR, for the
detection of the neurotoxin genes can be used to assist in
diagnosis of disease (Akbulut et al., 2005).
Serum from affected animals may be used to demonstrate
circulating neurotoxin, using mouse inoculation.
Treatment
·To neutralize unbound toxin,  antitoxin should be
administered promptly, either intravenously or into the
subarachnoid space on three consecutive days.
·Toxoid may be given subcutaneously to promote an active
immune response even in those animals that have received
antitoxin.
· Large doses of penicillin are administered intramuscularly or
intravenously to kill toxin-producing vegetative cells of C.
tetani in the lesion.
· Surgical debridement of wounds and removal of foreign
bodies, followed by flushing with hydrogen
peroxide, produces aerobic conditions which help to inhibit
bacterial replication at the site of injury. This aspect of
treatment is extremely important as studies in humans
showed that, without debridement, it was possible to isolate
C. tetani from patients after 16 days of treatment with
intravenous penicillin (Campbell et al., 2009).

relaxants and good nursing can minimize clinical discomfort
and maintain vital functions.

vaccinated animal sustains a deep wound

-Unvaccinated animals that have sustained deep wounds or
are presented for surgery should be given antitoxin. This
passive protection usually lasts about 3 weeks.
Botulism
Botulism is a serious, potentially fatal intoxication usually
acquired by ingestion of pre-formed toxin. Clostridium
botulinum,  the aetiological
agent,
isananaerobic
Gram-positive rod which
produces oval, subterminal
endospores.  The endospores 
ofC.botulinumare
distributed in soils and aquatic environments worldwide.
Seven types of Clostridium botulinum are recognized,
based on the antigenic properties of the toxins (A, B, C, D,
E, F, G) which they produce. These neurotoxins, which are
inactivated by boiling for up to 20 minutes, induce similar
clinical signs but differ in their antigenicity and potency.
Some C. botulinum
ntypes are confined to particular
geographical regions. Germination of endospores, with
growth of vegetative cells and toxin production, occurs in
anaerobic locations such as rotting carcasses, decaying
vegetation
and
contaminated
canned
foods.
Toxico-infectious botulism, an uncommon form of disease
in animals, occurs when spores germinate in wounds or in
the intestinal tract. Intestinal toxico-infectious botulism has
been recorded in foals (shaker-foal syndrome), pups
(Farrow et al., 1983), broiler chickens and turkey poults.
This form of the disease is of increasing importance in
illicit drug users following contamination of needles.
628
Spores of C. botulinum which are inadvertently introduced
during subcutaneous injection of drugs germinate and
produce toxin. In addition, thereis circumstantial evidence
that equine grass sickness, a dysautonomia, may be due to
toxico-infection with C. botulinum types C and D
(McCarthy et al., 2004a,b).
Clostridium botulinum types C and D cause most
outbreaks of botulism in domestic animals. Outbreaks of
disease occur most commonly in waterfowl, cattle, horses,
sheep, mink, poultry and farmed fish. Pigs and dogs are
relatively resistant to the neurotoxins, and botulism is rare
in domestic cats. Botulism in cattle has been associated
with ingestion of poultry carcasses present in ensiled
poultry litter used as bedding or spread on pasture
(McLoughlin et al., 1988). Poor-quality baled silage and
silage or hay containing rodent carcasses have been linked
to outbreaks of botulism in horses and ruminants. Pica,
arising from  starvation or phosphorus deficiency in
herbivores on ranches in South Africa, USA and Australia,
may induce affected animals to chew bones or carcasses
containing botulinum toxin. The resultant botulism is
known as lamsiekte in South Africa, bulbar paralysis in
Australia and loin disease in the USA. Contaminated raw
meat and carcasses are often sources of toxin for
carnivores. Waterfowl and other birds can acquire toxin
from dead invertebrates and decaying vegetation or from
the consumption of maggots containing toxin (Hariharan
and Mitchell, 1977; Quinn and Crinion, 1984). The usual
sources of the toxins of C. botulinum types A-G for
susceptible species are summarized in Table 22.2.
Pathogenesis
629
The neurotoxins of C. botulinum are the most potent
biological toxins known. One minimum lethal dose, which
is sufficient to kill a mouse, is equivalent to 10 pg of toxin
for botulinum toxin type A (AOAC International, 2001).

the
gastrointestinal tract, circulates in the bloodstream and acts
at the neuromuscular junctions of cholinergic nerves and at
peripheral autonomic synapses. Its structure and mode of
action are similar to those of tetanus toxin. The heavy
chain mediates binding to receptors on the nerve endings.
The light chain or toxic moiety enters the cytosol of the
cell following endocytosis and pore formation. As with
tetanus toxin, hydrolysis of synaptobrevins and other
with the release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine in
this instance, resulting in flaccid paralysis. Death results
from paralysis of respiratory muscles. The difference
between the effects of tetanus and botulinum toxins is due
to their different sites of action. Tetanus toxin travels up
the nerve axon to the ventral horn whereas botulinum toxin
remains at the neuromuscular junction.

In
toxico-infectious
botulism, however,
germination of spores in the intestine results in toxin
production by the vegetative organisms. The factors that
predispose to toxico-infectious botulism are not known.
The shaker-foal syndrome, a form of toxico-infectious
botulism in foals up to 2 months of age, has been attributed
to the impact of stress on the dam leading to increased
corticosteroid levels in the milk (Swerczek, 1980)
Clinical signs
631
The clinical signs of botulism, which develop 3 to 17 days
after ingestion of toxin, are similar in all species. Dilated
pupils, dry mucous membranes, decreased salivation,
tongue flaccidity and dysphagia are features of the disease
in farm animals. Incoordination and knuckling of the
fetlocks is followed by flaccid paralysis and recumbency.
Paralysis of respiratory  muscles leads  to  abdominal
breathing. Body temperature remains normal and affected
animals are alert. Death may occur within days of the
emergence of clinical signs. In birds, there is progressive
flaccid paralysis which initially affects legs and wings.
Paralysis of muscles of the neck (limberneck) is evident
only in long-necked species.
Diagnostic procedures
Suspect carcasses and material should be handled with
caution as large amounts of potent neurotoxin may be
present.
· Clinical signs and a history of access to contaminated food
may suggest botulism as the cause of an outbreak of an
ill-defined neurological disease.
· Confirmation requires the demonstration of toxin in the
serum of affected animals. The traditionalmethod for
demonstrating toxin is by mouse inoculation. Injected mice

consequence of abdominal breathing following paralysis of
respiratory muscles. Serum collected from dead animals is
only accepted method of confirming botulism because of its
takes up to 4 days (Cai and Singh, 2007). However, probably
because of their extreme susceptibility, botulinum toxin is
632
rarely detected in the serum of affected cattle (Hogg et af.,
2008). Gastrointestinal contents collected immediately after
death and frozen to prevent post-mortem proliferation of any
C. botufinum organisms may be a better sample in which to
demonstrate toxin in cattle.
 The polymerase chain reaction and nucleic acid probe-based
methods have been used for the detection of C. botulinum
toxin genes. However, detection of genes does not prove
production of biologically active toxin and is thus an aid to
diagnosis only.
· Immunological methods using ELISA or chemiluminescent
assays are sensitive and specific procedures for toxin
detection and have the advantages of speed and the
possibility of automation. Despite the development of
different amplification methods for signal detection, the
sensitivity of these tests does not equal that of the mouse
bioassay method. Existing and possible future methods for
(2007).
·Toxin neutralization tests in mice, using monovalent
antitoxins, can be employed to identify the specific toxin
involved if required. Sera should be collected from a number
of affected animals because failure to demonstrate toxin in
individual animals does not exclude botulism.
·Identification of the toxin in feedstuffs may be of value in
epidemiological studies.
· Typing of C. botulinum isolates can be carried out using a
number of molecular typing techniques. These techniques,
which are usually carried out during epidemiological studies,
include multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis
(Macdonald et al., 2008) and random amplified polymorphic
DNA analysis (Hyytia et al., 1999).
Treatment
· If available, polyvalent antiserum is effective in neutralizing
unbound toxin early in the course of disease. Cost and
         
therapeutically.
633
· Therapeutic agents such as tetraethylamide and guanidine
hydrochloride, which enhance transmitter release at
neuromuscular junctions, may be of value when given
intravenously.
·Mildly affected animals often recover over a period of weeks
without therapy.
·Good nursing should complement the therapeutic regime.
·As the cellular pathogenesis of botulism is further clarified,
particularly the binding mechanism of the toxin, it may be
possible to develop novel effective antidotes in the future.
Control
·Vaccination of cattle with toxoid may be indicated in
endemic regions in South Africa and Australia. Routine
vaccination of farmed mink and foxes may be advisable.
·Suspect foodstuffs should not be fed to domestic animals.
· Where feasible, provision of a balanced diet prevents pica in
herbivores when grazing on ranges during periods of
drought.
Clinical conditions caused by histotoxic clostridia

domestic animals (Table 22.3). The exotoxins elaborated

Usual habitats
Endospores of histotoxic clostridia are widely distributed
in the environment and can persist for long periods in soil.
The endospores of particular clostridial species are often
found in certain localities and in well defined geographical
regions.
Pathogenesis
It is probable that the majority of ingested endospores are

become distributed in the tissues where they remain

endospore distribution in tissues is unclear. Spores
originating in the intestinal lumen may be transported to
the tissues in phagocytes. Tissue injury leading to reduced
oxygen tension is required for spore germination and
replication of vegetative bacteria. Local necrosis produced
by the exotoxins of the replicating bacteria allows further
proliferation of the organisms in the tissues with extension
of the necrotizing process.

wound infections and also in some enteric conditions.
The exogenous infections, malignant oedema and
lgas
gangrene, result
from
the
introduction of clostridial
organisms into wounds. The anaerobic environment in
necrotic tissue is conducive to replication of the clostridia
which are often present together with facultative anaerobes
in mixed infections. Extension of local tissue destruction
results from exotoxin production. The generalized clinical
signs
s in both
exogenous
and
endogenous clostridial
infections are manifestations of toxaemia. The major
toxins produced by the histotoxic clostridia and their
biological activites are listed in Table 22.3.
In many
instances, toxins that are similar in structure and function
are produced by different species of histotoxic clostridia
although nomenclature is not consistent across the species.
The α toxin of one species is not necessarily the same
636
toxin as the o toxin of another species. The o and β toxins
of C. sordellii, the o toxin of C. novyi and the o and β
toxins of C. difficile (an enteropathogenic Clostridium)
belong to a family of structurally and functionally related
exotoxins kmown as the large clostridial cytotoxins. These
toxins are enzymes that inactivate low molecular weight
GTP-binding proteins by glucosylation.  Inactivation of
these proteins disrupts the cytoskeleton leading to opening
of tight junctions and cell death. The o toxin of C.
chauvoei is an oxygen-stable haemolysin and the α toxin
of C. perfringens A is a phospholipase.
Clinical infections
The clinical infections produced by histotoxic clostridia
include blackleg, malignant oedema, gas gangrene, braxy,
infectious
necrotic
hepatitis
and
bacillary
haemoglobinuria.
These disease conditions tend to recur on certain farms in
the absence of suitable  vaccination  programmes.
Histotoxic clostridial infection should be considered when
individual animals die suddenly. Gross post-mortem
findings may further indicate clostridial involvement.
Blackleg
Blackleg, an acute disease of cattle and sheep caused by C.
chauvoei, occurs worldwide. In cattle, the disease is most
often encountered in young thriving animals from 3
months to 2 years of age and infection is usually
endogenous, the latent spores in muscle becoming
activated through traumatic injury. The disease may affect
sheep of any age, and in many instances exogenous
637
infection occurs through skin wounds. In both cattle and
sheep, gangrenous cellulitis and myositis caused by
exotoxins produced by the replicating organisms usually
lead to rapid death. The large muscle masses of the limbs,
back and neck are frequently affected. Skeletal muscle
damage is manifest by lameness, swelling and crepitation
due to gas accumulation. Lesions in the muscles of the
tongue and throat may produce dyspnoea. Myocardial and
diaphragmatic lesions may cause sudden death without
premonitory signs.  Fluorescent antibody techniques or
PCR techniques applied to specimens from lesions are
rapid and sensitive confirmatory methods
Malignant oedema and gas gangrene
Malignant oedema and gas gangrene are exogenous
necrotizing soft-tissue infections. The bacteria most
commonly implicated are C. septicum in malignant
oedema and C. perfringens type A in gas gangrene.
However, C. novyi type A, C. chauvoei and, rarely, C.
association with other clostridial species. Other aerobic
and anaerobic opportunistic invaders may be present in the
lesions also. Infection can follow contamination of
wounds, parturition injuries or injection sites. Tissue
devitalization associated with trauma provides the low
       d 
products required for clostridial proliferation.
Malignant oedema manifests as cellulitis with minimal
gangrene and gas formation. Tissue swelling due to
oedema, and coldness with discoloration of the overlying
skin are obvious clinical features. Generalized signs of
638
toxaemia include depression and prostration. Death may
follow rapidly when lesions are extensive.
Gas gangrene is characterized by extensive bacterial
invasion of damaged muscle tissue. Gas production is
detectable clinically as subcutaneous crepitation. The
clinical features of toxaemia in gas gangrene are similar to
those encountered in malignant oedema.
In rams, clostridial infection of head wounds caused by
    ,   
swelling of subcutaneous tissues of the head, neck and
cranial thorax. Death may be rapid. The clinical signs are
attributed to the necrotizing lethal α toxin of C. novyi type
A.
Braxy
Braxy, an abomasitis of sheep, is caused by the exotoxins
of C. septicum. The disease, which occurs in winter during
periods of heavy frost or snow, has been recorded in parts
of northern Europe and occasionally elsewhere in the
world. It has been suggested that ingestion of frozen
herbage may cause local devitalization of abomasal tissue
at its point of contact with the rumen, allowing invasion by
C. septicum. The course of the disease is rapid and most
animals die without premonitory signs.  Anorexia,
depression and fever may be evident immediately before
death. Clostridium septicum may be demonstrated in
specimens from the abomasal lesion by the fluorescent
antibody technique.
Infectious necrotic hepatitis
639
Infectious necrotic hepatitis (black disease) is an acute
disease that affects sheep and occasionally cattle. Rare
cases have been described in horses and pigs. The hepatic
necrosis is caused by exotoxins of C. novyi type B
replicating in liver tissue which has been damaged by
immature Fasciola hepatica or other migrating parasites.
Although the condition is considered to be endogenous, it
is possible that the migrating flukes may carry the bacteria
or their spores to the liver. Death is rapid with no
premonitory signs and the disease requires differentiation
from acute fasciolosis. The term ^black disease' relates to
the dark discoloration of the skin caused by the marked
venous congestion of subcutaneous tissues observed at
post-mortem examination. The  fluorescent antibody
technique may be used to demonstrate C. novyi type B in
specimens from liver lesions.
Bacillary haemoglobinuria
Bacillary haemoglobinuria occurs primarily in cattle and
occasionally in sheep. In this endogenous
infection with C. haemolyticum, the clostridial endospores
are dormant in the liver, probably in Kupffer cells. As in
infectious necrotic hepatitis, the main factor that facilitates
spore  germination  and  clostridial  replication  is  fluke
migration. The α toxin, a phospholipase produced by
vegetative cells, causes intravascular haemolysis in
addition to hepatic necrosis. Hae moglobinuria, a major
clinical feature of the disease, is a consequence of
extensive red cell destruction. The aetiological agent may
be demonstrated in specimens from hepatic lesions by the
fluorescent antibody technique.
640
Diagnostic procedures
Histotoxic clostridia contributing to these conditions can be
identified by fluorescent antibody techniques.
· Clostridium perfringens is cultured anaerobically on blood
agar at 37°℃ for 48 hours.
·Colonies of C. perfringens type A are up to 5 mm in
diameter, circular, flat, greyish and surrounded by a zone of
double haemolysis (Fig. 22.3)
Apositive CAMP test occurs with Streptococcus agaiactiae
A diffusible factor released by S. agalactiae enhances the
partial haemolysis produced by the α toxin of C. perfringens.
The pattern of haemolysis is similar to that observed in the S.
agalactiae reaction with the β haemolysin of Staphylococcus
aureus (see Fig. 15.4).
· The Nagler reaction, a plate neutralization test, identifies the
α toxin of C. perfringens, which has lecithinase activity (Fig.
22.4).
· For many histotoxic species, PCR techniques have been
developed for the identification of the organisms in tissues,
including C. chauvoei (Kuhnert et al., 1997; Uzal et al.,
2003) and C. septicum (Sasaki et al., 2001).
Treatment and control ofhistotoxic clostridial diseases
· Because the pathogenesis of the diseases caused by the
histotoxic clostridia is similar, the procedures relevant to
their treatment and control are also similar.
·Although treatment is usually ineffective, penicillin or
broad-spectrum antibiotics administered to animals early in
the disease may be of value.
Vaccination, usually with bacterin and toxoid components in
adjuvant, is the most effective method for preventing these
diseases. Multicomponent vaccines, which induce protection
against several pathogenic clostridial species, may be
required on some farms. Animals should be vaccinated at 3
months of age and given a booster injection approximately 3
weeks later. Annual revaccination is recommended.

Enteropathogenic and enterotoxaemia-producing clostridia
Clostridia that produce enterotoxaemia and enteropathy
replicate in the intestinal tract and elaborate toxins that
produce both localized and generalized effects. Pathogenic
strains of these clostridia may be present in the intestinal
flora of animals but only produce disease in defined
circumstances.
Clostridium perfringens
Types A, B, C and D of Clostridium perfringens are of
particular significance in domestic animals. Factors that
predispose to clostridial proliferation  in  the intestine
include inappropriate husbandry methods, sudden dietary
changes and local environmental influences. Thus, many
diseases caused by these bacteria may be regarded as
multifactorial   and
1prevention
1 involves  appropriate
management strategies.
Usual habitat
Clostridium perfringens is found in soil, in faeces, and in
the intestinal tracts of animals and humans. Clostridium
perfringens types B, C and D may survive in soil as spores
for several months. Clostridium perfringens type A, which
constitutes part of the normal intestinal flora, is widely
distributed in soil.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
potent, immunologically distinct exotoxins which cause
643
the local and  systemic effects  encounteredin
enterotoxaemias. There are four major toxins produced, α,
β, ε,and t; the pattern of production varies with each C.
perfringens type and determines the clinical syndrome
observed. The toxins produced by C. perfringens types A
to E, their biological activities and associated diseases are
presented in Table 22.4. A range of minor toxins, some of
which may enhance virulence, is also recognized. These
include haemolysins, a collagenase, perfringolysin O, a β2
toxin and a hyaluronidase. In addition, enterotoxin, which
has cytotoxic properties, is produced by all strains and is
important in enteric disease caused by C. perfringens in
animals.
The relative importance of the different toxins, which is
known for only some C. perfringens types, is indicated in
Table 22.4. Although a toxin is produced by all types of C.
perfringens and is known to play a major role in gas
gangrene, its role as a virulence factor in enteric conditions
produced by type A strains is less clear. Some studies on
necrotic enteritis of chickens even suggest that the toxin is
not an essential pathogenicity factor as a type A mutant
strain which did not produce α toxin retained full virulence
in an in vivo model (Keyburn et al., 2006).
Predisposing    intestinal   and    dietary    factors    allow
opportunistic overgrowth of C. perfringens in sheep (Box
22.1). Sustained high levels of clostridial exotoxins are
usually required for the development of systemic clinical
signs.
Clinical infections
644
The diseases associated with C. perfringens types A to E
are listed in Table 22.4. Although C. perfringens type A is
primarily associated with gas gangrene in humans and
domestic animals and with food poisoning in humans, it is
also associated with necrotizing enterocolitis in unweaned
and feeder pigs, necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens,
canine haemorrhagic gastroenteritis and typhlocolitis in
horses. Clostridium perfringens type E causes enteritis in
rabbits and occasionally haemorrhagic enteritis in calves.
In sheep, C. perfringens types B, C and D cause lamb
dysentery, ^struck' and pulpy kidney disease respectively.
Clostridiumperfringenstypes
AandCcause
haemorrhagic enteritis in neonatal piglets. In other species,
comparable diseases are described periodically.
Lamb dysentery
This disease of young lambs, caused by C. perfringens
type B, has been reported in parts of Europe and South
Africa. Morbidity in flock outbreaks of lamb dysentery can
be up to 30% with high mortality rates. Affected lambs.
usually in the first week of life, may show abdominal
distension, pain and blood-stained faeces. Many die
suddenlywithout
premonitory
signs.Thehigh
susceptibility of this age group can be attributed to the
absence of microbial competition and low proteolytic
activity in the neonatal intestine (Box 22.1). β Toxin is
extremely sensitive to trypsin digestion but in the absence
of proteolytic activity it retains its potency and produces
disease. In contrast, ε toxin, which is also produced by C.
perfringens type B, requires proteolysis via trypsin for
activation. It is suggested  that prevailing intestinal
conditions at the time of infection may select for
645
predominant activity by one or other toxin (Uzal and
Songer, 2008). At post-mortem, extensive haemorrhagic
enteritis with areas of ulceration is present in the small
intestine. Increased capillary permeability induced by the
toxin results in fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity
and in the pericardial sac.
Box 22.1 Factors which  predispose  to  the
development of enterotoxaemias associated with
Clostridium perfringens in sheep.
· Low proteolytic activity in the neonatal intestine:
- Presence of trypsin inhibitors in colostrum
 Low level of pancreatic secretion
 Incomplete establishment  of normal  intestinal
flora in neonates
·Dietary influences in older animals:
- Abrupt change to a rich diet
- Gorging on energy-rich diet
- Intestinal hypomotility, a consequence of
overeating

Pulpy kidney disease
This disease, caused by C. perfringens type D, occurs in
sheep worldwide.
The
 condition  is also described as
'over-eating disease’ because gorging on a high grain diet
or on succulent pasture predisposes to its development
(Box 22.1). Ingestion of excessive quantities of food leads
to‘carry-over
 of partially digested food from the rumen
into the intestine. The high starch content in the partially
digested food is a suitable substrate for rapid clostridial
proliferation. Sustained production of ε toxin, which exists
as a prototoxin and requires activation by proteolytic
enzymes,
,leads to toxaemia and the development of
clinical signs
647
Thriving lambs from 3 to 10 weeks of age are commonly
affected. The course of the disease is usually short and
lambs are often found dead. Clinical signs include
dullness, opisthotonos, convulsions and terminal coma.
Central nervous system signs such as blindness and head
pressing may be present in subacute disease. Bloating may
be evident in the later stages of illness. Hyperglycaemia
and glycosuria are constant features of the disease.
Affected adult sheep, which have survived for several
days, may exhibit diarrhoea and staggering.
In acute disease, the only post-mortem findings may be
scattered hyperaemic areas in the intestines and fluid
accumulation in the pericardial sac. Rapid kidney autolysis
which leads to pulpy cortical softening
is  a  typical  post-mortem  finding.  Focal  symmetrical
encephalomalacia, a manifestation of the subacute effects
of ε toxin on the vasculature, is characterized by
symmetrical haemorrhagic lesions in the basal ganglia and
midbrain.
Clostridium perfringens type C infection in sheep
Infection with C. perfringens type C causes ^struck', an
acute enterotoxaemia
inadult sheep indefined
geographical regions such as the Romney Marsh district in
England. The disease, which occurs in sheep at pasture,
manifests as sudden death although some animals may be
found in terminal convulsions. β Toxin plays the major
role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Post-mortem
findings include jejunal ulceration, patchy hyperaemia in
the small intestine and accumulation of fluid in the
648
peritoneal  cavity  along  with  congestion  of  peritoneal
vessels and petechial haemorrhages.
Haemorrhagic enteritis in piglets
This peracute enterotoxaemia caused by C. perfringens
type C has been described worldwide in newborn piglets
Often, entire litters are affected with mortality rates up to
80%. Infection is probably acquired from the sow's faeces.
outbreaks.
The clinical course of the disease is short, death occurring
within 24 hours of onset. Recent immunohistochemical
studies showed that binding of β toxin to vascular
endothelial cells occurs early in the course of disease and
this may induce the vascular necrosis which contributes to
the pathological lesions observed (Miclard et al., 2009).
Older piglets up to 2 weeks of age, which are occasionally
affected, develop a more chronic form of the disease. The
clinical signs include dullness, anorexia and, terminally,
blood-stained faeces and perianal hyperaemia. Necrosis of
the intestinal mucosa and blood-stained contents are
present at post-mortem examination. The lesions are
usually found in the terminal small intestine, caecum and
colon. Excess serosanguineous fluid is present in the
pleural and peritoneal cavities. A less severe necrotizing
enterocolitis in unweaned and feeder pigs is caused by C.
perfringens type A strains
Necrotic enteritis of chickens
649
Necrotic enteritis, caused by C. perfringens type A and,
less frequently, by type C strains, primarily affects broilers
up to 12 weeks of age. It is an acute enterotoxaemia
characterized by sudden onset and high mortality.
Confluent necrotic areas in the mucosa of the small
intestine are found post mortem. Dietary changes,
intestinal  hypomotility  and mucosal  damage caused by
coccidia and other enteric pathogens predispose to the
development of disease. Mortality in birds concurrently
infected with Eimeria species is 25% higher than in those
affected by necrotic enteritis alone (Drew et al., 2004).
The importance of necrotic enteritis to the poultry industry
has increased in recent years in areas such as the EU in
particular, owing to the ban on the use of antimicrobial
growth promoters. For example, the incidence of disease in
France rose from 4% in 1995 to 12% in 1999 (Casewell et
al., 2003). A newly identified toxin, NetB, is now
       ss
enteritis strains, and α toxin may be of lesser importance,
although the latter appears to be capable of inducing a
protective immune response (van Immerseel et al., 2009).
Infections caused by C. perfringens t ypes B, C and D in
other domestic animals
Enterotoxaemias caused by C. perfringens type B have
been recorded in newborn foals, in calves and in adult
goats. In these species, the condition is rapidly fatal, and
severe haemorrhagic enteritis is a common post-mortem
finding
Clostridium perfringens type C has been associated with a
disease in feedlot cattle similar to ^struck' in adult sheep.
650
In calves, lambs and foals, infections with C. perfringens
type C result in acute enterotoxaemia along with a
haemorrhagic enteritis resembling that produced by the
infection in newborn piglets.
Enterotoxaemia caused by C. perfringens type D has been
reported in kids and adult goats. The clinical and
pathological features of acute disease in kids are similar to
those of pulpy kidney disease in lambs. Although subacute
forms of the disease have been described,  focal
symmetrical encephalomalacia has not been reported in
goats.
Diagnostic procedures
·Sudden deaths in groups of unvaccinated animals on farms
where outbreaks of  clostridialenterotoxaemiahave
 previously been recorded may suggest the involvement of C.
perfringens types B, C or D.
· In recently dead animals, post-mortem findings may be of
value. The presence of focal symmetrical encephalomalacia
is indicative of C. perfringens type D involvement (Buxton
et af., 1978).
· Direct smears from the mucosa or contents of the small
intestine of recently dead animals which contain large
numbers of thick Gram-positive rods are consistent with
clostridial enterotoxaemia.
· Isolation of large numbers of C. perfringens types B and C
from recently dead animals, especially in pure culture, is
supportive of a diagnosis. PCR genotyping can be used to
type C. perfringens isolates as an alternative to in vivo toxin
neutralization tests.
·Glycosuria is a constant finding in pulpy kidney disease.
· Toxin neutralization tests using mouse and guinea-pig
inoculation can definitively identify the toxins of C.
perfringens present in the intestinal contents of recently dead
651
animals. Because of the lability of some of these toxins,
particularly the β toxin, failure to demonstrate their presence
in intestinal contents does not necessarily exclude a
diagnosis of clostridial enterotoxaemia. The supernatant
from centrifuged ileal contents is generally used for the test.
Antitoxins with specificity for each C. perfringens type are
added to supernatant fluid to produce a mixture of three parts
test fluid to one part known antitoxin. Saline added to
supernatant is used as a positive control for the presence of
toxin. To allow neutralization of toxin, each mixture is held
ti soa aq o l  a  
into mice or intradermal injection into guinea-pigs. It is
usual to inject 0.3 ml of the mixture into mice and 0.2 ml
into   guinea-pigs.   The   pattern   of  cross-neutralization
observed in the mouse or guinea-pig tests indicates the
specific C. perfringens type which is the cause of the
enterotoxaemia.
ELISA can be used as an alternative to in vivo assays for
demonstrating toxin in intestinal contents (Songer, 1997).
The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA for detection of C.
inoculation methods. Indeed the sensitivity of ELISA
methods is frequently greater than that of in vivo methods
and this can lead to a misdiagnosis in the absence of other
diagnostic indicators.  Misdiagnosis can occur  because
ELISA can detect low levels of toxin in the intestinal
contents of normal animals (Uzal and Songer, 2008).
Treatment and control
 Hyperimmune serum, if available, may be of value in some
instances. Because of the acute nature of the disease,
antibiotic therapy is generally ineffective.
·Vaccination is the principal control method. Ewes should be
vaccinated with toxoid 6 weeks before lambing to ensure
passive protection for lambs up to 8 weeks of age. Ewes
being vaccinated for the first time should be given two doses
of vaccine 1month apart. Annual revaccination is
recommended.
652
· For the prevention of pulpy kidney disease, lambs should be
vaccinated with toxoid before they are 2 months old and a
booster injection should be given l month later.
· Sudden dietary changes and other factors predisposing to
enterotoxaemias should be avoided (Box 22.1).
Clostridium difficile
Infection with Clostridium difficile has been reported in
dogs with chronic diarrhoea (Berry and Levett, 1986) and
in haemorrhagic enterocolitis in new-born foals (Jones et
αl., 1988). Disease in foals can occur in the absence of
prior antimicrobial therapy (Jones et al., 1987) but disease
in other animals and in humans is usually associated with
antimicrobial  drug   therapy.   Antimicrobial   treatment
suppresses the normal flora in the intestine with
persistence of  the  clostridial  spores.  Germination and
proliferation of C. difficile is followed by toxin production
and diarrhoea. An emerging epidemic human nosocomial
strain, ribotype 027, is of major importance in human
healthcare and has also been reported recently in horses
(Songer et al., 2009). Clostridium difficile is documented
  si un o g p n no  s
United States. The organism produces two major toxins, A
and B, both of which belong to the family of large
clostridial cytotoxins. Toxin A is an enterotoxin and B is a
potent cytotoxin. Both act by inactivating low molecular
weight GTP-binding molecules leading to disruption of the
cytoskeleton. Clostridium difficile and its toxins can be
detected in the faeces of normal animals and many aspects
of disease pathogenesis remain unclear. However, recent
studies indicated that diarrhoeic horses with toxin A and/or
C. difficile in faeces had more severe disease than those
without C. difficile (Ruby et al., 2009). Diagnosis is based
653
on the demonstration of toxin in faeces using ELISA or
cytotoxicity assays. Commercial ELISA kits are available
for humans although their suitability for testing specimens
from animals has not been evaluated thoroughly. Chouicha
and Marks (2006) found that sensitivity of ELISA was
unsatisfactory for canine samples. Prevention of diarrhoea
associated with C. difficile is based on good antimicrobial
prescribing practices, alleviation of stress and thorough
cleaning and disinfection (Baverud, 2004)
Clostridium colinum
This clostridial organism has been implicated in enteritis in
quails (quail disease), chickens, turkeys,
pheasants and grouse. Clostridium colinum is shed in the
faeces of clinically affected and carrier birds. Mortality
may approach 100% in susceptible quails but is usually
less than 10% in chickens. Intestinal ulceration and, in
some instances, hepatic 
  necrosis  are  present  at
post-mortem examination.
Antibiotics are used therapeutically in drinking water or in
feed. Contaminated litter should be removed regularly as
part of a control programme.
Clostridium spiroforme
Clostridium spiroforme, a clostridial organism with
atypical coiled morphology, has been implicated  in
spontaneous and antibiotic-induced enteritis in rabbits.
This enterotoxaemia-like condition may be fatal within 48
hours. Predisposing factors include oral administration of
antibiotics and low-fibre diets. Antibiotic administration
654
adversely affects the intestinal flora of the rabbit, which is
composed predominantly of Gram-positive bacteria. A
toxin elaborated by C. spiroforme is neutralized by
antitoxin to the l toxin of C. perfringens type E as it is
structurally similar to this toxin (Borriello and Carman,
1983). It is a binary toxin with cytolytic activity and is
encoded by the genes sas and sbs. PCR assays for the
detection of the organism and the toxin-encoding genes
have been described (Drigo et al., 2008).
Clostridium piliforme
This
spore-forming,
filamentous
Gram-variable
intracellular  pathogen  is  an atypical  member  of  the
clostridia. It has not been cultured on artificial media and
grows only in tissue culture or in fertile eggs. Although
originally named Bacillus piliformis, DNA sequencing
demonstrated its relatedness to the clostridia (Duncan et
al., 1993). The source of the organism is usually an
infected animal.
Infection with C. piliforme, Tyzzer's disease, results in
severe hepatic necrosis. The condition was originally
described in mice and other laboratory animals (Sparrow
and Naylor,  1978).  It has been reported to occur
sporadically in foals and rarely in calves, dogs and cats.
Stress or immunosuppression may predispose to infection.
Affected foals are usually under 6 weeks of age and many
are found comatose or dead. Following oral infection, the
incubation period is up to 7 days. Clinical signs include
depression, anorexia, fever, jaundice and diarrhoea.
Hepatomegaly with extensive areas of necrosis is the
655
principal post -mortem finding. Diagnosis is based on the
histological demonstration of the organisms in hepatocytes
using the Warthin-Starry silver impregnation technique
PCR-based techniques for detection of the organism have
been described also (Borchers et al., 2006). Because of the
acute nature of the disease, it is usually not possible to
administer specific therapy.

Mycobacterium species
Mycobacteria are aerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile.
rod shaped, acid-fast bacilli. Individual species differ in
size; the rods of Mycobacterium bovis and M. avium subsp.
avium are slender and up to 4 (μm in length, whereas those
of M. avium subsp. paratubercu-losis are broad and are
usually less than 2 (μm long
Although mycobacteria are cytochemically Grampositive,
the high lipid and mycolic acid content of their cell walls
prevents uptake of the dyes employed in the Gram stain.
The cell wall lipids bind carbol fuchsin which is not
removed by the acid-alcohol decolorizer used in the
Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining method. Bacilli that stain red
by this method are called acid-fast or ZN-positive.
The mycobacteria include diverse species ranging from
environmental saprophytes and opportunistic invaders to
obligate pathogens.
Although some pathogenic mycobacteria exhibit particular
host preferences, they can occasionally infect other species
(Table 23.1). Mycobacterial diseases in domestic animals
are usually chronic and progressive. Members of the M.
uberculosis complex are closely related and cause similar
pathological changes in a number of mammalian hosts
(Table 23.1).

extended periods (Morris et al., 1994).

Differentiation of pathogenic mycobacteria
The ZN staining
method is used  to differentiate
mycobacteria from other bacteria. Differentiation of
pathogenic mycobacteria relies on cultural characteristics,
biochemical tests, animal inoculation and chromatographic
analyses. In 
addition,  molecular  techniques  are
665
increasingly
used
for
identification
of

Mycobacteria associated with opportunistic infections can
be differentiated on the basis of pigment production,

 Pathogenic mycobacteria grow slowly on solid media, and
colonies are not evident until cultures have been incubated
for 3 to 6 weeks. In contrast, the colonies of rapidly growing
666
saprophytes are visible within days. Commercially available
liquid culture systems such as BACTEC'
(Becton
Dickinson and Company, USA) show improved isolation
times for pathogenic mycobacteria,  ranging
from
approximately 10 to 20 days.
·Mycobacteriumbovis,
M.
.tuberculosis and M.avium
subsp.paratuberculosis  have   an  optimal  incubation
temperature of 37°C. Mycobacteria belonging to the M.
vium complex grow in the temperature range 37 to 43°C.
·Cultural features:
- Pathogenic species of mycobacteria can be distinguished
by their colonial appearance on egg-based media
- The influence of glycerol and sodium pyruvate on growth
rate is used to differentiate pathogenic species.
- Supplementation of media with mycobactin is required for
M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Mycobactin is extracted
from

aids in the identification of M. tubercufosis, M. bovis and M.
avium. Some mycobacterial isolates cannot be assigned to a
given species using biochemical differentiation as their
biochemical profiles are difficult to interpret (Gunn-Moore
et al., 1996).
· Guinea-pig and rabbit inoculation was used in the past to
differentiate M. tubercufosis from M. bovis and M. avium.
Guinea-pigs are highly susceptible to infection with M.
tuberculosis and M. bovis. Rabbits are highly susceptible to
infections with M. bovis and M. avium.
· Chromatographic analyses of the lipid composition of some
mycobacterial species are used in specialized laboratories.
· Pigment production and photoreactivity for opportunistic
mycobacteria:
667
- Non-chromogens produce colonies devoid of orange,
carotenoid pigments.
- Photochromogens, when cultured in the dark, produce
period of exposure to light.
- Scotochromogens produce pigment when cultured in the
dark or in light.
· Molecular techniques:
- DNA probes, complementary to species-specific sequences
of rRNA, are commercially available for the M. tuberculosis
complex, the M. avium complex and M. kansasii.
- Nucleic acid amplification procedures, including the
polymerase chain reaction, are being
developed as sensitive and rapid methods for the detection of
mycobacteria in tissue samples (Aranaz et al., 1996).
Although a number of commercial and in-house methods are
available, the reliability of many of the tests remains to be
confirmed and further development is required (Anon.,
2008).
- DNA-based typing methods are used in epidemiological
studies (Collins et al., 1994). Spoligotyping, which identifies
polymorphisms in the spacer units in the direct repeat region
of the chromosome, is the most common method used in
studies of M. bovis. This method, together with variable
number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing, is currently
considered the most satisfactory for epidemiological
investigation of M. bovis strains (Hewinson et af., 2006).
Typing of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains is
frequently   done   by   restriction

Diseases in domestic animals caused by mycobacteria
include tuberculosis in avian and mammalian species,
paratuberculosis in ruminants, and feline leprosy. Two
other clinical conditions, skin tuberculosis and bovine
farcy, are associated with the presence of acid-fast bacteria
in lesions. In skin tuberculosis of cattle, nodular lesions are
located along the course of lymphatics in the limbs.
Unspecified acid-fast bacilli have been demonstrated in
these lesions. Mycobac- terium senegalense and M.
farcinogenes have been isolated from the lesions of bovine
farcy. Their aetiological role in this condition, however, is
uncertain
Granulomatous

opportunistic infections with environmental sapro-phytic
mycobacteria are encountered occasionally in domestic
animals. These saprophytic mycobacteria are grouped on
the basis of pigment production and growth rate (Box
23.1). Members of the M. avium complex are grouped with
those that produce opportunistic infection because they are
occasionally involved in mammalian infections.
Tuberculosis in cattle
Bovine  tuberculosis, caused
1byM.bovis，occurs
worldwide. Because of the zoonotic implications of the
disease and production losses owing to its chronic
progressive nature, eradication programmes have been
introduced in many countries. The presence of M. bovis
reservoirs in wildlife makes disease eradication difficult to
achieve. When eradication programmes are successful,
infections in cattle caused by members of the M. avium
  s    
670
occasionally  encountered.  The incidence of human
infection with M. bovis has been reduced to low levels in
countries where tuberculosis eradication programmes have
been implemented in cattle. In addition, pasteurization of
milk has eliminated exposure of humans to infection from
dairy products. Cross-infection with M. tuberculosis from
infected humans has been recorded in cattle on rare
occasions.

Epidemiology
Although M. bovis can survive for several months in the
environment, transmission is mainly through aerosols
generated by infected cattle. Experimental studies have
established that infection of cattle by aerosol requires
fewer than 10 organisms whereas approximately 107
organisms are necessary to establish infection by the oral
route. Dairy cattle in particular are at risk because
husbandry methods allow close contact between animals at
milking and when housed during winter months. Calves
can become infected by ingesting contaminated milk and
ingestion is the probable route of transmission to pigs and
cats. Wildlife reservoirs of M. bovis are major sources of
infection for grazing cattle in some countries. They include
the badger in Europe, the brush-tailed possum in New
Zealand and the Cape buffalo and other ruminants in
Africa. Deer, both wild and farmed, are particularly
susceptible and may act as reservoirs of infection for
cattle. The relative importance of wildlife species as
reservoirs of infection depends on a number of factors
including whether or not the species is a maintenance or
spillover host, the levels of bacteria excreted by the
wildlife host and the degree of contact with cattle. In a
review by Cormer (2006), feral pigs in Australia are given
as an example of spillover hosts in which infection is not
perpetuated within the population in the absence of contact
with infected cattle. Feral pigs are infected by the oral
route and have small lesions containing few bacilli and are
thus deemed of low risk as a source of infection in cattle.
In contrast, badgers are maintenance hosts for M. bovis.
Lesions occur primarily in the badger lung, leading to the
generation of infective aerosols. In addition, there is
672
increased contact between cattle and badgers with
advanced disease because such badgers exhibit abnormal
behaviour such as straying close to grazing cattle during
daylight hours. Badgers are therefore an important source
of infection for cattle in particular regions of the world
such as the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
The virulence of M. bovis relates to its ability to survive
and multiply in host macrophages (Fig. 23.1). Specific
toxins have not been identified, but rather virulence is a
   s od  p nsn
to establish infection. Following entry to the host via the
respiratory
tract, mycobacteria
 are  engulfed   by
macrophages and by dendritic  cells. Mycobacteria
engulfed by dendritic cells travel to the draining lymph
nodes. The initial response to infection is non-specific and
triggered by the foreign body effect of waxes and lipids in
the
 mycobacterial
1cellwall.Survivalwithinthe
phagosome of macrophages is promoted by interference
with
 phagosome-lysosome
efusion, probably  through
retarding maturation of the phagosome and failure of
lysosomal
digestion.
Bacill1
ireleased fromdead
macrophages  are
engulfed
bysurrounding viable
phagocytes. Migration of macrophages containing viable
mycobacteria can disseminate infection.
The complex lipid and  waxy composition  of the
mycobacterial cell wall contributes not only to virulence
but also, in association with M. bovis proteins, to the
immunogenicity on which the development of the host
responses and the lesions depends. Before activation,
673
macrophages permit the survival and replication of
mycobacteria.  Infected macrophages accumulate in the
alveolus as the primary site of infection and secrete a range
of cytokines which recruit lymphocytes to the lung, thus
aiding granuloma formation and containment of the
organisms. The cytokines TNF-o. and IFN-y are essential
in the development of resistance to mycobacteria, and their
production is stimulated through both the innate and
adaptive immune responses. These cytokines activate
infected macrophages and enhance their ability to destroy
contained mycobacteria. Given that activated dendritic
cells are unable to kill engulfed mycobacteria but limit
their replication, these cells may act as a reservoir for
mycobacteria, in particular within the lymph nodes (Hope
and Villarreal-Ramos, 2008)
With the development of cell-mediated immunity some
weeks after infection, macrophage recruitment accelerates
under the influence  of cytokines  produced byT
lymphocytes sensitized to M. bovis cellular constituents.
Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are necessary for immunity
to mycobacteria although studies in cattle have shown that
CD8+ T cells may also play a role in the immunopathology
of M. bovis infection. The gradual accumulation of
macrophages around the developing lesion and the
formation of a central necrotic core result in a tubercle or
granuloma, the typical host response to M. bovis infection
(Fig. 23.2). The architecture of the granuloma is important
as it facilitates close interaction between the constituent
macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells and containment
or destruction of the pathogen. In addition, the layered
structure helps to physically separate the necrotic core
from the surrounding tissue. Granulomas may be
674
histologically visible  as early as  3weeks after
experimental infection of cattle with high doses of M.
bovis (Cassidy et al., 1998).
Frequently, only a small number of cattle within a herd
show positive reactions to the tuberculin test and develop
pathological lesions. It is likely that these animals
represent one end of the spectrum of responses to exposure
to M. bovis. Other animals in the herd may clear infection
without becoming sensitized to the tuberculin test
(Cassidy, 2008). Animals which test positive but in which
no lesions can be detected may be latently infected or may
have cleared the infection but remain sensitized to
tuberculin
Clinical signs and pathology
Clinical signs are evident only in advanced disease, and
cattle with extensive lesions can appear to be in good
health. Loss of condition may become evident as the
disease progresses. In advanced pulmonary tuberculosis,
animals may eventually develop a cough and intermittent
pyrexia. Involvement of mammary tissue may result in
marked induration of affected quarters, often accompanied
by supramammary lymph node enlargement. Tuberculous
mastitis facilitates spread of infection to calves and cats.
Consumption of unpasteurized milk is of major public
health importance.

Diagnostic procedures
The

ante-mortem test in cattle. The test can be adapted for use in
677
pigs and farmed deer. Reactivity in cattle is usually
         
1994). Tuberculin, prepared from mycobacteria and called
purified protein derivative (PPD), is injected intradermally to
detect sensitization. Two main methods of tuberculin testing
are employed:
- [n the single intradermal (caudal fold) test, 0.1 ml of
bovine PPD is injected intradermally into the caudal fold of
the tail. The injection site is examined 72 hours later and a
positive reaction is characterized by a hard or oedematous
swelling-

may be attributed to sensitization to mycobacteria other than
M. bovis. In countries in which a high proportion of false
positive reactions occur, the comparative test is used in
 preference to the single intradermal test.
·False negative test results may be recorded:
- Cattle tested before delayed-type hypersensitivity to
tuberculin develops (at about 30 days postinfection) do not
react.
- In some cattle an unresponsive state, referred to as anergy,
may accompany advanced tuberculosis. The mechanisms
involved are incompletely understood.
- A transient desensitization may  follow  injection  of
tuberculin. Reactivity usually returns within 60 days.

conjunction with the tuberculin test include:
- Gamma interferon assay. This test identiffies animals at a
slightly earlier stage of infection than the tuberculin test and
is approved as a supplementary test for cattle in the EU,
USA and New Zealand (de la Rua-Domenech et al., 2006).
It is frequently used as a parallel test with the tuberculin test
in persistently-infected herds or those showing extensive
breakdowns. In addition, research is ongoing to investigate
the use of this test for differentiation of BCG-vaccinated and
naturallyinfectedcattlethroughtheidentificationof
antigens which are not expressed by the BCG organism
(Pollock et al., 200l). Such antigens could then be used in
the test instead of the mammalian and avian PPD which are
used in the commercial tests currently available
 ELISA for detecting circulating antibodies. Antibodies are
produced in the later stages of infection. These tests may be
most useful in countries with a high prevalence of bovine TB
where there are a large number of animals with chronic
disease, and which require low-cost methods of detection (de
la Rua-Domenech et al., 2006).
- Lymphocyte transformation and related assays.
·Specimens suitable for laboratory examination include
lymph nodes, tissue lesions, aspirates and milk.
·The low numbers of mycobacteria present in bovine lesions
can render visual confirmation difficult using the ZN stain
 present in smears of specimens from deer and badgers (Fig.

679
tubercle formation (Fig. 23.2).
·Isolation of M. bovis requires:
- Decontamination of specimens to eliminate fast-growing
up to 30 minutes with 2 to 4% sodium hydroxide or 5%
oxalic acid, followed by neutralization of the alkali or acid.
Centrifugation is used to concentrate the mycobacteria, and
the supernatant fluid is discarded.
- Slants of Lowenstein-Jensen medium, without glycerol and
containing 0.4% sodium pyruvate, are inoculated with the
centrifuged deposit and incubated aerobically at 37°C for up
to 8 weeks.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
 Growth rate and colonial appearance
- Positive ZN staining of bacilli in smears from colonies
- Biochemical profile ( Table 23.2)
-Analyticaland molecular techniques which are now
routinely used  for  identification of  isolates  include
spoligotyping and use of various gene probes (Anon., 2008).
· Commercially available, rapid, automated systems can be
used for isolating pathogenic mycobacteria of the M.
tuberculosis complex (Yearsley et al., 1998) and provide
shorter isolation times than culture on conventional solid
media.

Control
· Treatment is inappropriate in control programmes for cattle
and testing for susceptibility of M. bovis strains to
antimicrobial agents is not usually carried out. Where studies
have been completed, organisms are usually susceptible to
most agents. However, antimicrobial resistance is a major
problem in organisms of the M. tuberculosis complex that
cause disease in humans, and poses huge challenges for the
treatment of human tuberculosis in many countries.
· In many countries, tuberculin testing of cattle followed by
isolation, slaughter of reactors and disinfection of farm
buildings forms the basis of national eradication schemes.
· Routine meat inspection is an essential part of the
surveillance programme for bovine tuberculosis in many
countries.
Wildlife reservoirs such as badgers and possums are major
obstacles to disease eradication in some countries. Culling of
wildlife has been successful in reducing the prevalence of M.
bovis infection in cattle in some countries (Corner, 2006).
However, in
the UK, increased prevalence of infection in cattle was
recorded in areas adjacent to those in which badger culling
was carried out (White et af., 2008).
Research is ongoing worldwide in order to develop a vaccine
for use in cattle and also in wildlife. Strategies include the
improvement of the effectiveness of the BCG (Bacille
681
Calmette-Guerin) vaccine, which has been used in humans
for decades, possibly by using heterologous prime-boost
strategies (Hope and Villarreal-Ramos, 2008). A variety of
subunit vaccines consisting of either protein or DNA have
been reported to enhance resistance against M. tuberculosis
and also against M. bovis. Co-administration of DNA
vaccines with BCG vaccine enhanced protection against
aerosol challenge with virulent M. bovis. Heterologous
prime-boost immunization strategies using two different
types of vaccine vectors, each expressing the same antigen,
have been evaluated for protection against M. tuberculosis in
humans. Studies using prime-boost strategies in cattle
employing three DNA vaccines encoding mycobacterial
enhancement of protection compared with BCG alone (Hope
and Villarreal-Ramos, 2008).
Tuberculosis in poultry and other avian species
Avian tuberculosis, which occurs worldwide, is usually
caused by members of the M. avium complex, serotypes 1
to 3. The disease is encountered most often in free-range
adult birds. Bacilli, excreted in the faeces of birds with
advanced lesions, can survive for long periods in soil.
Non-specific clinical signs including dullness, emaciation
and lameness develop in affected birds only when the
disease is at an advanced stage. At postmortem
examination, granulomatous lesions are characteristically
present in the liver, spleen, bone marrow and intestines.

smears from lesions. Ante-mortem diagnosis of avian
tuberculosis in free-range poultry is based on tuberculin
testing, using avian PPD injected into the skin of a wattle.
Mycobacteriumtuberculosis occasionallyinfects parrots
682
and canaries and M. genavense has been isolated from pet
birds (Hoop et al., 1993).
Members of the M. avium complex cause infections in
immunocompromised humans. Rare cases of generalized
disease in cats, dogs and horses caused by members of the
ingestion of uncooked swill contaminated with M. avium
often develop small tuber-cles in  the retropharyngeal,
submaxillary and cervical lymph nodes
Feline leprosy
It is generally considered that feline leprosy, a cutaneous
disease of worldwide distribution, is caused by M.
lepraemurium, the aetiological agent of rat leprosy.
Sporadic transmission of the organism to cats probably
occurs through bites from infected rodents,the wildlife
reservoirs. Nodular lesions, involving subcutaneous
tissues, may be solitary or multiple and are usually
confined to the head region or the limbs. The nodules.
which are fleshy and freely movable, tend to ulcerate.
Large numbers of ZN-positive bacilli are present in smears
from  the  lesions.
Histopathological
examination
demonstrates many infiltrating macrophages which contain
densely packed mycobacteria.
Mycobacterium lepraemurium, a slow-growing fastidious
organism, requires a specially formulated culture medium
for growth. It does not appear to be infectious for other
species of domestic animals or for humans. Diagnosis is
based on the histopathological features of the lesions and
683
mycobacteria, which can  also cause granulomatous
dermatitis in cats. Surgical excision of lesions is the
preferred treatment.
Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease)
Paratuberculosis is a chronic, contagious, invariably fatal
enteritis which can affect domestic and wild ruminants.
The aetiological agent, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis,
is  an acid-fast   organism  formerly referred
toas
Mycobacterium johnei.
Uncertainty  exists  regarding the  association  between
infection  with  M.  avium  subsp. paratuberculosis and
Crohn's disease, a chronic enteritis in humans (Waddell et
al., 2008).
Epidemiology
The epidemiology of the disease has been studied in cattle
and the pattern of infection and spread in other species is
assumed to be similar. Infection is acquired by calves at an
early age through ingestion of organisms shed in the faeces
of infected animals. Shedding of M. avium subsp
paratuberculosis in colostrum and milk has been recorded
(Taylor et al., 1981; Streeter et al., 1995). Feeding of
pooled colostrum is considered to be a risk factor for the
acquisition of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis by calves
in infected herds although the magnitude of the risk is not
clear (Nielsen et al.
2008; Stabel, 2008). Mycobacterium avium subsp.
paratu-berculosis may remain viable in the environment
for up to a year under suitable conditions.
684
Although the organism has been isolated from the genital
organs and semen of infected bulls (Larsen et al., 1981),
venereal transmission is unimportant epidemiologically. In
utero transmission has been reported but its importance as
a means of spread is unknown. Whittington and Windsor
(2009) conducted a review and meta-analysis of the
literature and calculated the estimated incidence of calves
infected by this route for herds with a range of different
values for within-herd prevalence. They suggested that
incidence could range from 0.44 to 9.3 calves infected in
ranging from 5% to 40%. Such incidence rates could be
significant in herds in which hygienic calf rearing is
practised with separation of calves at birth and feeding of
pasteurized colostrum and artificial milk replacer. There
are
three
major  subtypes
ofM.aviumsubsp
paratubercu-losis, bovine (type I), ovine (type Il) and
intermediate (type IIl) strains: ovine strains have been
isolated from cattle and bovine strains from sheep. In
addition, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis has been
isolated from many wildlife species, including rabbits,
deer, ferrets and mice. Molecular typing techniques show
that strains infecting wildlife and domestic animals sharing
the same environment are frequently indistinguishable but
the degree to which M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis
strains exhibit host specificity or host preference is unclear
at present (Motiwala et al., 2006). However, rabbits are
considered a key element in the persistence of infection in
the environment and may contribute in part to difficulties
in controlling Johne's disease (Daniels et al., 2003 ;
Davidson et al., 2009).
685
Calves under 1 month of age are particularly susceptible to
infection and are more likely to develop clinical disease
than animals infected later in life. The incubation period of
paratuberculosis is protracted and variable. Clinical disease
is rarely encountered in cattle under 2 years of age. Signs
of disease do not develop in all infected animals; some
become   subclinical  carriers  and   shed  mycobacteria
intermittently in their faeces.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis is an
intra-cellular pathogen and cell-mediated reactions are
mainly responsible for the enteric lesions.   Ingested
mycobacteria are taken up by M cells over Peyer’ S
patches. Uptake is through the interaction of fibronectin
attachment proteins with fibronectin, followed by binding
to integrins on the surface of the M cells. The organisms
cross the intestinal epithelial layer and are engulfed by
macrophages in which
theysurvive and replicate
Interference with maturation of the phago-some and
important for intracellular survival of M. avium subsp
paratuberculosis as is the case for M. bovis. As the disease
progresses, an immune-mediated granulomatous reaction
develops, with marked lymphocyte and macrophage
resulting enteropathy leads to loss of plasma proteins and
malabsorption of nutrients and water. The macrophages in
the intestinal wall and in the regional lymph nodes contain
        s
recognized,
multibacillary
(lepromatous)
and
paucibacillary (tuberculoid), which appear to be correlated
686
with host immune response. High levels of IL-10 gene
expression were detected in cattle with extensive
pathological  changes and high numbers of bacteria,

prevailing view of the immune response to M. avium
predominates early in  the post-infection period  when
disease is subclinical whereas a Th2 response occurs later
in infection during clinical disease (Stabel, 2007).
Clinical signs and pathology
Clinical signs develop in most ruminant species after a
prolonged subclinical phase of infection. Affected cattle
are usually more than 2 years of age when signs are first
observed. The disease is clinically evident only in mature
sheep and goats. Clinical signs may develop rapidly in
farmed deer and may be evident by 1 year of age.
The main clinical feature in cattle is diarrhoea, initially
intermittent but  becoming persistent  and profuse.
Progressive weight loss results without loss of appetite.
and affected animals seldom survive for more than a year
after initial detection.
In sheep and goats, diarrhoea is less marked and may be
absent. In some infected deer, there may be rapid weight
weeks. In others, extreme emaciation may develop over a
period of months without evidence of diarrhoea (Gilmour
and Nyange, 1989).
687
In cattle, the mucosa of affected areas of the terminal small
intestine and the large intestine is usually thickened and
folded into transverse corrugations. The mesenteric and
ileocaecal lymph nodes are enlarged and oedematous.
Thickening of the intestinal mucosa is less marked in
sheep, and necrosis and caseation may be present in the
regional lymph nodes. Lesions in deer are similar to those
in sheep.

Diagnosis
· Paratuberculosis requires differentiation from other chronic
wasting diseases in ruminants.
 Specimens for direct microscopy from live animals include
scrapings or pinch biopsies from the rectum. Faeces may be
submitted for culture and serum for serological tests.
 Post-mortem  specimens  for histopathological  examination
from cattle include tissue from affected regions of the
intestines and from regional lymph nodes.
688
· Specimens for microscopical examination should be stained
by the ZN technique (Fig. 23.4).
· Isolation of M. avium subsp- paratuberculosis from faeces or
tissues is a sensitive diagnostic procedure but it is difficult
and time-consuming. After decontamination of the specimen
with 0.3% benzalkonium chloride and concentration by
centrifugation, slants of Herrold's egg-yolk medium with
and without mycobactin are inoculated with the deposit.
Slants are incubated aerobically at 37°C for up to 16 weeks
and examined weekly for evidence of growth.
· More rapid isolation techniques, which are based on growth
in liquid media and detection of growth using radiometric
methods (e.g. BACTEC), are available. These commercial
systems are suitable for large specialized laboratories.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
- Colonies less than l mm in diameter, usually colourless
and hemispherical, appear in 5 to 16 weeks. Isolates from

more slowly than isolates cultured from cattle and goats.
- Smears from colonies are ZN-positive.
- Medium containing mycobactin supports growth.
- PCR techniques for the detection of insertion sequence
IS900  which
is specific forM.avium subsp.
paratuberculosis.
·Serological tests:
laborious and relatively insensitive.
- The agar-gel immunodiffusion test has low sensitivity but
may be useful for confirming clinical infection.
- Several ELISA tests have been developed for the detection
of antibodies to M. avium subsp- paratuberculosis, some of
which are commercially available. Nielsen and Toft (2008)
689
evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of these tests and
found them to be highly variable. Sensitivity was higher in
clinically-affected cattle shedding organisms compared with
those infected but not shedding organisms in faeces. ELISA
for use with milk is also available.
· Cell-mediated responses:
 Johnin, the counterpart of tuberculin PPD, may be used as
a field test. The preparation is inoculated intradermally or
intravenously into cattle. The reliability of the test is
questionable and, in addition, it may sensitize cattle to
tuberc ulin.
- The gamma interferon assay is widely used for early
detection of infected animals. As with ELISA, reported
sensitivity and specificity of the test are variable (Nielsen
and Toft, 2008).
limited value and are infrequently used.
·DNA probes, which are highly sensitive, are being used to
detect M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in faeces. Several
real-time PCR methods have now been published and are of
comparable sensitivity to culture but much more rapid.
Control
· Animals with clinical signs suggestive of paratu-berculosis
should be isolated. If the condition is confirmed, affected
animals should be slaughtered promptly as they shed large
numbers of mycobacteria which can contaminate buildings
and pasture.
· Detection and elimination of subclinically affected animals
are challenging for clinicians and laboratory staff. Testing
should be carried out on a herd or flock basis. Subclinical
excretors may be detected by faecal culture at intervals of 6
months or by detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis
690
in faeces using DNA probes. Serology, using the absorbed
ELISA, may detect subclinical infection.
· In problem herds, appropriate hygiene and husbandry
measures should be instituted to prevent infection of young
susceptible animals. Calves

·Inactivatedadjuvantedandliveattenuated
1whole-cell
vaccines are available. In cattle, vaccination may reduce the
number of clinical cases but cannot be relied on to eliminate
the disease from a herd. Because vaccinated animals usually
become sensitized to tuberculin, vaccine use in some
countries is subject to regulatory control. The development
ofnewsubunit
vaccines for theprevention of
paratu-berculosis infections in animals offers improved
options for future control measures (Rosseels and Huygen,
2008). These vaccines are based on immunodominant
protein antigens which stimulate a strong THl response, and
some vaccines may enable serological differentiation of
vaccinated and naturally  infected animals as naturally
infected animals produce a poor antibody response to these
particular protein antigens. However, limited data are
available to date on the performance of these newer vaccines
in experimentally infected animals or from field trials.

Chapter 24
Enterobacteriaceae
Bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae are
Gram-negative rods up to 3 μm in length (Fig. 24.1) which
ferment glucose and a wide range of other sugars and are
oxidase-negative.
They
are
catalasepositive
non-spore-forming facultative anaerobes which grow well
on MacConkey agar because they are not inhibited by the
bile salts in the medium. These enteric organisms reduce
nitrates to nitrites, and some species, notably Escherichia
coli, ferment lactose. The motile enterobacteria have
peritrichous flagella. The family contains more than 40
genera and over 180 species. Less than half of the genera
       
'coliform', formerly only used to describe enterobacteria
capable of fermenting lactose, is now sometimes used to
describe other members of the family.
Enterobacteria can be arbitrarily grouped into three
categories: major pathogens, opportunistic pathogens and
non-pathogens. Those without pathogenic significance for
animals, such as Hafnia and Erwinia, can be isolated from
faeces and from the environment and may contaminate
clinical specimens. Opportunistic pathogens occasionally
cause clinical disease in locations other than the alimentary
tract. The major animal pathogens E. coli, Salmonella
species and Yersinia species can cause both enteric and
systemic disease.
Usual habitat
698
Bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae have a
worldwide distribution, inhabit the intestinal tract of
animals and humans and contaminate vegetation, soil and
water. Some members of the family constitute part of the
normal flora of the intestinal tract whereas some of the
pathogenic organisms are disseminated by clinical and
subclinical excretors and by survival in the environment
Key points
· Gram-negative rods
· Growth on non-enriched media
· Oxidase-negative
·Facultative anaerobes, catalase-positive
·Most are motile by peritrichous flagella
- Ferment glucose, reduce mitrate to mitrite
· Enteric bacteria which tolerate bile salts in
MacConkey agar
·  Cause a variety of clinical infections
· Major enteric and systemic pathogens:
- Escherichia coli
- Salmonella serotypes
- Yersinia species
 Opportunistic pathogens:
-Proteus species
 Enterobacter species
 Klebsiella species
-Some other members of the Enterobacteriaceae
699
Differentiation of the Enterobacteriaceae
Gram-negative
rodswhich
 are oxidase-negative
presumed to be members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The
main criteria for differentiating pathogenic members are
presented in Table 24.1. Few enterobacteria, apart from
some strains of E. coli. produce haemolysis on blood agar
· Lactose fermentation in MacConkey agar:
- The colonies of lactose fermenters and the surrounding
medium are pink due to acid production from lactose.
-The colonies of non-lactose fermenters and the
due to utilization of peptones in the medium.
·Reactions on selective/indicator media:
-A number of commonly used media, including brilliant
green (BG) agar and xylose-lysine- deoxycholate (XLD)
agar, are used to differentiate Saimonella from other
enteropathogens. On BG agar, Saimonella colonies and the
surrounding medium show a red alkaline reaction. On XLD
medium the colonies of most Salmonella serotypes are red
       
sulphide (H2S) production.
- A wide range of chromogenic agars have been developed
for the easy identification and enumeration of E. coli in
clinical samples and food specimens.  Examples include
eosin-methylene blue (EMB) agar on which the colonies of
some isolates of E. coli have a unique metallic sheen.
HarlequinTM TBGA (Lab M, Bury, Lancashire, UK), which
can be used for identification and enumeration of E. coli, is
based on β-glucuronidase activity, an enzyme which is
700
highly specific for E. coli. On this medium colonies develop
a blue- green colour.
·Colonial morphology:
- Mucoid colonies are typical of Klebsiella and Enterobacter
species while rare isolates of E. coli are mucoid.
-Proteus species produce characteristic swarming on
non-inhibitory media such as blood agar.
- Serratia marcescens is unique among the opportunistic
pathogens in its ability to produce red pigment.
· Reactions in triple sugar iron (TSl) agar:
 This is a non-inhibitory indicator medium used primarily
to confirm that colonies isolated on BG, XLD or other
selective media are those of Saimoneila. Other members of
the Enterobacteriaceae isolated on BG or XLD media can
be differentiated by their reactions in TSl. Triple sugar iron
agar contains 0.1% glucose, 1% lactose and 1% sucrose and
chemicals to indicate H2S production. Phenol red is used as
an indicator for pH change (red at pH 8.2, yellow at pH 6.4).
A black precipitate of ferrous sulphide is indicative of H2S
production. An inoculum from a single isolated colony of the
organism under test is stabinoculated with a straight wire
into the butt of the TSl agar, and on withdrawal the slant

18 hours at 37°C. The reactions in this medium of the more
important members of the Enterobacteriaceae are presented
in Table 24.2.
·Additional biochemical tests:
- The lysine decarboxylase production test is used to
distinguish Proteus species from Saimonella species as these
organisms have similar reactions in TSI agar. Proteus
species are negative in the test, whereas Salmonella species
invariably produce the enzyme. Production of lysine
701
decarboxylase is indicated by a purple colour in the liquid
medium; in a negative test, the medium is yellow.
- Urease production distinguishes Proteus species from
Saimonella species. Proteus species produce urease whereas
Saimonella species do not.
The IMViC (indole production, methyl red test,
Voges-Proskauer test, citrate utilization) tests are a group of
biochemical reactions used to differentiate E. cofi from other
lactose fermenters (Table 24.1)
Tests for motility allowdifferentiation of Klebsiella
species (non-motile) from Enterobacter species (motile).
Both species produce similar mucoid colonies which are
difficult to distinguish visually (Table 24.1).
·Commercial biochemical tests:
-A number of commercial biochemical test systems are
available for differentiating enterobacteria. Some of these
systems incorporate a wide range of biochemical tests and
results  can be matched   against computer-generated
numerical profiles to identify isolates to a species level.
·Serotyping of E. coli, Saimonella and Yersinia species
- Slide agglutination tests with antisera are used to detect O
(somatic) and H (flagellar) antigens in all three species and
sometimes detection of K (capsular) antigens is carried out
(Fig. 24.3). Serotyping allows identification of the organisms
involved in disease outbreaks and has applications in
epidemiological investigations.
· Molecular techniques, usually based on PCR, are
increasingly used both for detection of enterobacteria in
isolates.
· Molecular typing techniques are now widely used for
epidemiological
 tracingofmembers of the
702
Enterobacteriaceae and it is likely that these techniques will
eventually replace older methods such as serotyping.
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is used for tracing the source of
outbreaks and is extensively used in the investigation of
Saimonella infections in humans. The Pulse-Net programme
of the Center for Disease Control in the USA is a system
whereby PFGE profiles of isolates from around the world
can be compared using an electronic computerized database.
Multilocus sequence typing does not provide the same
degree of discrimination as PFGE-based techniques but it
can be used for comparing the genetic relatedness of isolates
from different geographical regions worldwide.

Escherichia coli
Escherichia coli is usually motile with peritrichous flagella
       
pink colonies on MacConkey agar and has characteristic
biochemical reactions in IMViC tests (Table 24.1). Some
strains produce colonies with a metallic sheen when grown
on eosin-methylene blue agar. Haemolytic activity on
blood agar is a characteristic of certain strains of E. coli.
Somatic (O), flagellar (H) and sometimes capsular (K)
antigens are used for serotyping E. coli. The somatic
antigens are lipopolysaccharide in nature and located at the
surface of the cell wall. The specificity of these antigens is
determined by carbohydrate side chains. The flagellar
antigens are protein in nature and the capsular antigens are
composed of polysaccharides. Proteinaceous fimbrial (F)
antigens are present in many strains and act as adhesins
facilitating attachment to mucosal surfaces.
706
Colonization of the mammalian intestinal tract by E. coli
from environmental sources occurs shortly after birth.
These organisms persist as important members of the
normal flora of the intestine throughout life. Most strains
of E. coli can be regarded as commensal organisms and are
of low virulence but may cause opportunistic infections in
extraintestinal locations such as the mammary gland and
urinary tract.  Strains of E. coli which produce
extraintestinal disease frequently colonize the intestinal
tract of normal  animals  also.  Strains that cause
enterocolitis are not usually part of the normal flora of
healthy animals and infection
results from direct contact with clinically or subclinically
infected animals or by ingestion of contaminated food or
water. Pathogenic strains of E. coli possess virulence
factors which allow them to colonize mucosal surfaces and
subsequently produce disease. Predisposing factors that
permit colonization and render animals susceptible to the
development of clinical disease include age, immune
status, nature of diet and heavy exposure to pathogenic
strains.
The main categories of pathogenic strains of E. coli in
animals and their clinical effects are presented in Figs 24.4
and 24.5. In general, strains can be divided into those
causing enteric disease and those responsible for
extraintestinal infections. However, not all strains conform
strictly to these categories in that strains in one category
may induce pathogenic effects similar to those induced by
strains in the other category.
In
recent
years，E. coli O157:H7 and other
enterohaemorrhagic  serotypes have emerged as major
707
food-borne, zoonotic pathogens in humans, responsible for
the haemorrhagic colitis-haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
The virulence factors of pathogenic strains of E. coli
include capsules, endotoxin, structures responsible for
adherence  and colonization,  enterotoxins and other
secreted substances.
Capsular polysaccharides, which are produced by some E.
coli strains, interfere with the phagocytic uptake of these
organisms. Capsular material, which is weakly antigenic,
also interferes with the antibacterial effectiveness of the
complementsystem.
· Endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of the cell
wall of Gram-negative organisms, is released on death of the
bacteria. It is composed of a lipid A moiety, core
polysaccharide and specific side chains. The role of LPS in
disease production includes pyrogenic activity, endothelial
damage leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation,
and endotoxic shock. These effects are of greatest
significance in septicaemic disease.
· Fimbrial adhesins which are present on many strains of E.
coli allow attachment to mucosal surfaces in the small
intestine and in the lower urinary tract. Firm attachment to
expulsive effects of peristalsis and the flushing effect of
urine. Many fimbrial adhesins have been identified. The
most significant adhesins in strains of E. coli producing
disease in domestic animals are K88 (F4), K99 (F5), 987P
(F6), F18 and F41. The more recent system of nomenclature
uses *F’ and a number to identify particular fimbriae. The
originally some of the fimbrial adhesins were mistakenly
thought to be capsular (K) antigens. The use of *P’ derives
from the term pilus, because fimbriae are sometimes known
708
as pili. The most common adhesin present in strains of E.
coli infecting pigs is K88. The receptor for the K88 antigen
is encoded by a dominant gene and thus if a sow is
homozygous recessive for the gene, her colostrum contains
no anti-K88 antibody, resulting in highly susceptible piglets.
F41 adhesins occur in calves and K99 in calves and lambs.
Although the numbers of receptors for K88 adhesins on pig
enterocytes decline with age, K88+E. coli strains may cause
diarrhoea in piglets after weaning. Receptors for F18 are
found only in older piglets and thus Fi8+ strains are
important in postweaning diarrhoea and oedema disease.
Although neonatal piglets are susceptible to strains of E. coli
bearing F6 adhesins, resistance to colonization develops by 3
weeks of age. Both K88 and K99 adhesins are encoded by
plasmids.
·An adhesin termed intimin is associated with attaching and
effacing E. cofi (AEEC). This adhesin is one of the products
 a pn psi uod e ui ppoua s go
of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Intimin is encoded by the
enterocyte attaching and effacing (eae) gene and is an outer
membrane protein of AEEC strains. Intimin binds to the
translocated intimin receptor (Tir) and this receptor is also
the bacterium where it forms a receptor to which intimin can
bind.
AEEC produce characteristic attaching and effacing lesions
epithelial cell membrane with marked rearrangement of the
cytoskeleton. In addition, the lesion involves pedestal
formation, effacement of microvilli, premature enterocyte
exfoliation and villous distortion. Although AEEC strains
possess the LEE, the exact mechanisms which result in the
attaching and effacing lesion are unclear. The LEE is known
to encode several secreted proteins, a type IHl secretion
apparatus, intimin and the intimin receptor Tir, but the
detailedevents at cellular levelwhichresult in lesion
production are not yet fully elucidated.
· The pathological effects of infection with pathogenic E. coli,
other than those attributed to endotoxin, derive mainly from
709
the production of enterotoxins, shigatoxins or verotoxins or
cytotoxic necrotizing factors (Figs 24.4 and 24.5). Unlike
enterotoxins which affect only the functional activity of
enterocytes, shigatoxins and cytotoxic necrotizing factors
can produce demonstrable cell damage at their sites of
action.
- Two types of enterotoxins, heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable
(ST), have been identified. Each type of enterotoxin has two
subgroups. Many strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)
fluid into the intestine through stimulation of adenylate
cyclase activity. Most ETEC isolates which produce LT1
also possess K88 adhesins. A second heat-labile toxin, LT2,
has been demonstrated in some ETEC strains isolated from
cattle. One of the heat-stable enterotoxin subgroups, STa,
has been identified in strains of ETEC isolated from porcine,
bovine, ovine and human specimens. This toxin induces
increased guanylate cyclase activity in enterocytes, and the
resultant increase in intracellular guanosine monophosphate
stimulates fluid and electrolyte secretion into the small
intestine and inhibits fluid absorption from the intestine. The
heat-stable enterotoxin STb also causes secretion of chloride
and bicarbonate ions as well as inhibition of absorption of
sodium ions through mechanisms which differ from those of
STa and LT1.
· Enteroaggregative heat stable toxin 1 (EASTl) is found in
some enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic
E. coli (EPEC) strains, and is found in all
enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains. It also acts
through the stimulation of cyclic GMP but strains producing
EAST1 alone are incapable of causing diarrhoea (Nagy and
Fekete,2005)
-Verotoxins (VT), also known as shigatoxins (ST), are
similar structurally,functionally and antigenically to the
shigatoxin of Shigella dysenteriae.These toxins are
heat-labile and lethal for cultured Vero cells. Shigatoxigenic
E.coli (STEC) colonizing the intestines can damage
710
enterocytes and, when shigatoxin is absorbed into the
bloodstream, it exerts a deleterious effect on endothelial
cells in relatively defined anatomical locations such as the
central nervous system in pigs. Shigatoxins inhibit protein
synthesis in eukaryotic cells but the relatively greater degree
of damage induced in certain tissues may relate to
differences in receptors for these toxins. Vascular damage
can lead to oedema, haemorrhage and thrombosis. The
shigatoxin ST2e is implicated in oedema disease of pigs.
- Cytotoxic necrotizing factors, CNF1 and CNF2, and
recently CNF3 (Orden et af., 2007), have been demonstrated
in extracts of strains of E. cofi isolated from cases of
extraintestinal E. coli infections in animals and humans. It is
known that CNF1 is encoded chromosomally whereas CNF2
is encoded by a transmissible plasmid known as Vir.
Although these toxins have been shown to induce
pathological changes in laboratory animals and culture cells,
the exact role of CNF toxins in the production of disease in
domestic animals is still uncertain.
·Alpha-haemolysin, although often a useful marker for
virulence in certain strains of E. coli, does not appear to
contribute directly to their virulence but is closely linked
with the expression of other virulence factors. Haemolysin
production is often a feature of strains of E. coli isolated
from pigs with oedema disease and diarrhoea. It has been

Clinical infections
The main categories of disease produced by pathogenic
strains of E. coli are indicated in Figs 24.4 and 24.5.
Clinical infections in young animals may be limited to the
intestines (enteric colibacillosis, neonatal diarrhoea), or
may manifest as septicaemia (colisepticaemia, systemic
colibacillosis) or   toxaemia
(colibacillary toxaemia).
[n
older pigs, post-weaning enteritis and oedema disease are
manifestations
of
toxaemia.
Extraintestinal
localized
infections in adult animals, many due to opportunistic
invasion, can involve the urinary tract, mammary glands
and uterus.
713
Enteric colibacillosis
Enteric colibacillosis primarily affects newborn calves,
lambs and piglets. Oral infection with a pathogenic strain
of E.  coli, colonization of the intestine and toxin
production are prerequisites for the development of this
condition. The incidence and severity of the disease
increases under intensive systems of management. This
may reflect heavy exposure of young animals to
pathogenic strains of E. coli as a result of build-up of
infection in the environment. Factors that may predispose
young farm animals to infection by strains of pathogenic
E. coli are summarized in Box 24.1. Enterotoxigenic
strains of ETEC, possessing fimbrial adhesins such as K88
and K99, are of
f  particular  importance  in  neonatal
diarrhoea. These strains colonize the distal small intestine
by attaching to receptors which are present on the
enterocytes of neonates. They produce enterotoxins (LT
and STa) which stimulate hypersecretory diarrhoea and
interfere
with
fluid
absorption
without
major
morphologically detectable damage  to enterocytes.  In
contrast, necrosis of enterocytes with stunting and fusion
of villi are features of enteric colibacillosis caused by
strains of attaching/ effacing E. coli, which colonize the
lower small intestine and the colon. These strains induce
diarrhoea through  maldigestion  and malabsorption  of
nutrients in the small intestine and by reducing the
absorptive capacity of the colonic mucosa.

· Build-up of pathogenic E.coli strains
· Overcrowding and poor hygiene,

· Normal flora of neonates not fully established
·Naive immune system in neonates
· Receptors for ETEC adhesins are present only
during first week of life in calves
·Pigs retain receptors for some adhesins past
weaning age (post-weaning diarrhoea)
· Digestive tract of young pigs equipped only for
easily digested foods. Accumulation of undigested
and unabsorbed nutrients encourages replication of
E.cofi
· Stress factors such as cold ambient temperatures
and frequent mixing of animals
In enteric colibacillosis in calves, diarrhoea develops
within the first few days of life. Faecal consistency is
somewhat variable. In some cases faeces are profuse and
watery, in others they are pasty, white or yellowish and
rancid. This rancid faecal material may accumulate on the
tail and hind limbs. Depression becomes marked as
dehydration and acidosis develop. Mildly affected animals
may recover spontaneously. Without treatment, severely
affected calves die within a few days
Piglets may succumb to enteric colibacillosis within 24
hours of birth. Often, an entire litter is affected and,
715
as the disease progresses, piglets refuse to suck. A profuse
watery diarrhoea rapidly leads to dehydration, weakness
and death. Although enteric colibacillosis occasionally
affects lambs, the septicaemic form of the disease is more
common.
Colisepticaemia
Systemic infections with E. coli are relatively frequent in
calves, lambs and poultry. Septicaemic strains of E. coli
have  special  attributes  for  resisting host   defence
mechanisms. They invade the bloodstream following
infection of the intestines, lungs or umbilical tissues (navel
i11).
Septicaemic spread throughout the body commonly occurs
in calves with low levels of maternally-derived antibodies
and the severity of the disease corresponds to the degree of
hypogammaglobulinaemia  (Penhale  et  al., 1970).
Colisepticaemia often presents as an acute fatal disease
with many of the clinical signs attributable to the action of
endotoxin. Pyrexia, depression, weakness and tachycardia,
with or without diarrhoea, are early signs of the disease.
Hypothermia and prostration precede death which may
occur within 24 hours. Meningitis and pneumonia are
commonlyencounteredinaffectedcalvesandlambs.
Postsepticaemic localization in the joints of calves and
lambs results in arthritis with swelling, pain, lameness and
stiffgait.
Watery mouth occurs in lambs up to 3 days of age and has
been associated with systemic invasion by E. coli (King
and Hodgson, 1991; Sargison et al., 1997). It is
716
characterized by severe depression, loss of appetite.
profuse salivation and abdominal distension. The condition
is encountered in lambs born in confined lambing areas.
e u A pe o paxa A sae Aiq
lambs is high, many dying within 24 hours of clinical
onset. Death is attributed to endotoxic shock.
In poultry, airsacculitis and pericarditis may develop
following septicaemia. Coligranuloma (Hjarre's disease) is
characterized by chronic inflammatory changes resembling
tuberculous lesions which are encountered at post-mortem
examination in laying hens.
Oedema disease of pigs
Oedema disease is a toxaemia which usually occurs 1 to 2
weeks after weaning
g in rapidly  growing pigs. The
aetiology of the disease is complex, with nutritional and
environmental changes
 andother stressfactors
contributing to its development. A limited number of
haemolytic E. coli serotypes have been isolated from the
intestinal tract in cases of the disease. These noninvasive
strains replicate in the tract and produce a shigatoxin
(ST2e) which is absorbed into the bloodstream and
damages endothelial cells with consequent perivascular
oedema.
The onset of oedema disease is sudden, with some animals
found dead without showing clinical signs. Characteristic
signs include posterior paresis, muscular tremors and
oedema of the eyelids and the front of the face. The squeal
may be hoarse due to laryngeal oedema. The faeces are
usually firm.  Flaccid paralysis precedes death which
717
typically occurs within 36 hours of the onset of clinical
signs. Animals that recover frequently have residual
neurological dysfunction. The characteristic post-mortem
lesions are oedema of the greater curvature of the stomach
and the mesentery of the colon. Perivascular oedema in the
central
]nervous system,  detectable on histological
examination, accounts for the neurological dysfunction.
Cerebrospinal  angiopathy,  in which there is marked
fibrinoid necrosis in vessel walls, may develop in animals
surviving acute oedema disease.
Post-weaning diarrhoea of pigs
This condition occurs within a week or two after weaning,
often following changes in feeding regimens or in
management and with possible involvement of rotaviruses.
The majority of outbreaks are associated with ETEC
strains but EPEC may be involved. Clinical signs vary
from an afebrile disease withinappetence to watery
diarrhoea in severe cases. Diarrhoea and purplish
discoloration of areas of the skin are often observed. Some
animals may die suddenly (van BéersSchreurs et al.,
1992).
Coliform mastitis
Infection of the mammary glands of cows and sows by
members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli,
occurs opportunistically. In dairy cows, the source of
infection is faecal contamination of the skin of the
mammary gland, and relaxation of the teat sphincter
following milking increases vulnerability to infection. Host
factors are of major importance in determining whether
718
disease 0ccurs (see Chapter 93). Cows with low somatic
cell counts are particularly susceptible to infection. This
form of mastitis has not been linked to specific serotypes
of E. coli. The acute form of the disease is characterized by
endotoxaemia and can be life-threatening. Peracute disease
may be fatal within 24 to 48 hours. Affected animals are
severely depressed with drooping ears and sunken eyes.
Mammary secretions are watery and contain white flecks.
Urogenital tract infections
Opportunistic ascending infections of the urinary tract by
certain uropathogenic strains of E. coli result in cystitis
especially in bitches. These strains possess virulence
factors such as fimbriae which  facilitate mucosal
colonization.
Invasion  of hyperplastic  endometrium by  opportunistic
strains of E. coli is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of
canine pyometra. Prostatitis in dogs is also associated with
invasion by opportunistic E. coli strains
Diagnostic procedures
The age and species of the affected animal, the clinical
signs and the duration of illness may suggest the type of
infection and the category of disease. The selection of
specimens, the laboratory procedures for diagnosis and
appropriate treatment and control measures are influenced
by the history, the progress of the disease and the system
or organ affected.
719
· Suitable specimens include faecal samples from animals
with enteric disease, tissue specimens from cases of
septicaemia, mastitic milk, samples of midstream urine and
cervical swabs from suspected cases of pyometra or metritis.
· Specimens cultured on blood and MacConkey agar are
incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 to 48 hours.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
- On blood agar, colonies are greyish, round and shiny with
a characteristic smell. Colonies may be haemolytic or
non-haemolytic.
- On MacConkey agar, colonies are bright pink.
-[MViC tests can be used for confirmation (Table 24. 1).
- The colonies of some E. coli strains have a metallic sheen
OnEMB agar.
- A full biochemical profile may be necessary to identify
isolates from coliform mastitis or cystitis.
- Some serotypes are found in association with certain
disease conditions. Slide agglutination tests for O and H
antigens are employed for serotype identification.
·In suspected cases of colisepticaemia, isolation of the
organism in pure culture from the blood or from
parenchymatous organs is considered confirmatory.
·When enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli are suspected, the
presence of either enterotoxins or fimbrial antigens can be
techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction.
 Enterotoxins in the small intestine can be detected, using
methods employing monoclonal antibodies (Carroll et al.,
1990). Some of these reagents are available commercially
- For expression of fimbrial antigens, isolates should be
subcultured on Minca medium. Fimbrial antigens can be
720
identified using ELISA or latex agglutination (Thorns et af.
1989).
- PCR techniques using primers specific for genes encoding
heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins may be used to
identify enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli. Gene probes and
PCR primers for the detection of enterotoxins and other
virulence factors of E. coli of veterinary significance are
reviewed by DebRoy and Maddox (2001).
 x   sx  
necrotoxigenic strains can be detected by Vero cell assay
(Wray et af., 1993), it is now more usual to use PCR-based
methods using primers specific for genes encoding the
toxins. PCR primers used for the identification and
characterization of attaching and effacing E. coli have been
developed (Frohlicher et al., 2008).
Treatment
The nature and duration of therapeutic measures are
determined by the severity and duration of the disease
process.
·In calves with neonatal diarrhoea, milk should be
supplemented with fluids containing electrolytes. Severely
dehydrated  calves  require  parenteral fluid replacement
therapy.
· Calves with hypogammaglobulinaemia can be given bovine
gammaglobulin intravenously.
In most domestic species, enteric diseases may be treated, if
required, by oral administration of antimicrobial compounds
which are active in the gastrointestinal tract. Systemic and
localized  infections  require  parenteral  administration  of
therapeutic  agents.
Treatment should be based
on
susceptibility testing of isolates.
·Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem with respect to
E. coli organisms, particularly those isolated from
721
intensively-reared farm animals such as pigs and poultry.
Multiple resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobial
agents is common in isolates of E. coli from pigs and poultry
at time of slaughter and in clinical isolates from all animals.
both farm animals and pets (White et al., 2002; Anon,
2004a; Fairbrother et al., 2005; Lloyd, 2007). Increasing
transferred from animals to
humans, either through food or by direct contact. In addition,
multiple resistance in E. coli infections in animals is
significant because it limits therapeutic options and may lead
to treatment failure in some cases. Antimicrobial resistance
to newer agents is a particular concern in animal isolates of
E. coli, and isolates producing extended spectrum
most domestic animal species (Li et af., 2007). Resistance to
fluoroquinolones is an emerging problem in animals,
particularly in samples from clinical cases (Anon., 2004a,b).
·Because of the extensive local tissue damage, intramammary
treatment of coliform mastitis is often of limited value.
Therapy is aimed at counteracting shock and eliminating
toxic material from the mammary gland by frequent
stripping of affected quarters.
Control
·Newbornanimalsshouldreceiveampleamountsof
colostrum shortly after birth.  Colostral antibodies can
prevent colonization of the intestine by pathogenic E. coli.
Absorption of gammaglobulin from the intestine declines
progressively after birth and is negligible by 36 hours.
·A clean, warm environment should be provided for newborn
animals.
·Dietary regimes may contribute to the development of
oedema disease and other post-weaning conditions. To avoid
factors that may contribute to the occurrence of disease, new
feed should be introduced gradually.
722
· Vaccination is of value for a limited number of the diseases
caused by E. coli. Vaccination methods used for prevention
of enteric disease in piglets and calves include:
 Vaccination of pregnant cows with purified E. coli K99
fimbrial or whole-cell preparations, often combined with
rotavirus antigen, can be used to enhance colostral protection
(Snodgrass, 1986).
Commercially available killed  vaccines containing
prevalent pathogenic E. coli serotypes can be given to
pregnant sows. Research is ongoing into the development of
oral vaccines for postweaning diarrhoea in pigs which
contain live attenuated E. coli strains carrying the particular
fimbrial adhesins involved in disease production (Fairbrother
et al., 2005).
- A commercial vaccine is available for protection against E.

·Breeding for disease resistance can be employed and has
been used commercially to reduce the number of susceptible
      
implemented which greatly reduced the number of pigs
which were susceptible to E. coli F18-associated diarrhoea
(Fairbrother et al., 2005).
·Control of E. cofi infections in animals is important not only
for the prevention of disease in animals but also for public
health reasons. Much research has been carried out into
methods of controlling enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157 in
cattle. To date, only the feeding of a probiotic product
containing Lactobacillus acidophilus has been consistently
shown to reduce the shedding of E. coli O157 (LeJeune and
Wetzel, 2007). This product is available commercially in the
United States.
Salmonella serotypes
723
Salmonellae are usually motile and do not ferment lactose
(Table 24.1). Rarely, lactose-fermenting strains are
encountered. The genus Salmonella contains more than
2,500 serotypes, based on a system devised by Kaufmann
and White in which somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens
are identified. Occasionally, capsular (Vi) antigens may be
detected. In a modification of this scheme, two species
were proposed, S. enterica and S. bongori, and this system
was  accepted  by  the  Judicial  Commission  of  the
International  Committee on  Systematics of Prokaryotes
Salmonella enterica has been divided into six subspecies
(Le Minor and Popoff, 1987; Reeves et al., 1989). The
majority of salmonellae of veterinary importance belong to
S. enterica subspecies enterica. The subspecies are further
qualified by the serotype to give a final designation such as
S. enterica subspecies enterica serotype Typhimurium. A
phage typing system has been developed for a small
number of serotypes such as Typhimurium and Enteritidis
and is used for epidemiological investigation of isolates.
Salmonella serotypes occur worldwide. They infect many
mammals, birds and reptiles and are excreted mainly in
faeces. Ingestion is the main route of infection in
salmonellosis although it can also occur through the
mucosae of the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva
(Fox and Gallus, 1977). Colonization and persistence in
the tonsils appear to be important in pigs (Boyen et al.,
2008). Organisms may be present in water, soil, animal
feeds, raw meat and offal, and vegetable material. The
   
faeces. In poultry, some serotypes such as Salmonella
Enteritidis infect the ovaries, and the organisms can be
724
isolated from eggs. Salmonellae can survive in damp,
shaded soil for up to 9 months
(Carter et al., 1979), in empty poultry houses for at least a
year and over 2 years in poultry feed (Davies and Wray,
1996).
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Most serotypes of Salmonella enterica can infect a wide
range of host animals but host adaptation occurs with some
The molecular basis of host specificity is not fully
elucidated but host-adapted serotypes tend to cause more
severe disease than non-adapted sero-types. The virulence
of Salmonella serotypes relates to their ability to invade
and
replicate
 in epithelial
cells.Survival within
disease. Many of the virulence features of salmonellae are
encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI) and on
virulence plasmids. Salmonella pathogenicity islands
comprise clusters of virulence genes situated on the
bacterial chromosome or on plasmids, and 18 of these
‘islands' have been described to date (Hensel, 2004Fuentes
et al., 2008). Not all serovars contain all 18 SPIs, and the
exact functions of each pathogenicity island have not yet
been clarified.
Once ingested, salmonellae must survive the barrier of
gastric acid, and the organism possesses a number of
strategies to avoid or repair damage caused by acid stress.
There are two principal types of acid tolerance response,
one induced during the exponential growth phase and the
other which operates during the stationary phase of
725
growth. These systems protect against both organic and
inorganic acid stress through the production of several
acid-shock proteins. The organism may also be protected
in the stomach by the food matrix in which it is contained,
and the infectious dose appears to be low if the organism is
contained in food with a high fat content (de Jong and
Ekdahl, 2006). In the intestine, the organism adheres to the
mucosa through fimbrial attachment. Salmonellae are
known to produce several different types of fimbriae,
including type 1 fimbriae and long polar fimbriae. The
latter appear to be important in binding to the surface of
Peyer's patches and M cells (Baumler et al., 1996). Sef
fimbriae, encoded by SPI-10, are found in only a limited
number of serovars and are among the factors considered
to determine host specificity (Hensel, 2004).
Following attachment to the surface of intestinal mucosal
cells, the bacteria induce ruffling of cell membranes
(Salyers and Whitt, 1994). This ruffling is part of the
mechanism whereby the organisms are taken up into
non-phagocytic cells and is now known to be one of the
functions encoded by genes on SPI-1. This pathogenicity
island is found in all serotypes of S. enterica analysed to
date and one of its major effectors is a Type Iff secretion
system (TTSS). The TTSS is a complex of proteins which
forms a needle-like structure for the transfer of virulence
factors from the bacterium into the host cell (Foley and
Lynne, 2008). Some of these virulence factors are proteins
that interact with the actin cytoskeleton of the host cell,
causing rearrangements which lead to ruffle formation.
The ruffles facilitate uptake of the bacteria into
membranebound vesicles, termed Salmonella-containing
vesicles (SCV) which often coalesce. The organisms
726
replicate in these vesicles and are eventually released from
the cells, which sustain only mild or transient damage.
Other products transferred by the TTsS activate secretory
pathways and alter ion balance within the cell (Wallis and
Galyov, 2oo0). In addition, effector proteins result in
neutrophil recruitment, and the resulting inflammation.
together with the disturbance of fluid and ion balance,
causes diarrhoea (Foley and Lynne, 2008). In cattle, genes
involved in inflammatory responses and ion/fluid secretion
in the intestinal tract (Jones et al., 1998).
Many of the genes responsible for systemic invasion by
Salmonella serotypes are clustered in SPI-2. A TTSS is
encoded by this pathogenicity island also but the genes are
expressed only within the acidified SCV of the host cell.
The effector proteins of this secretory system are involved
in  the formation  of Salmonellainduced filaments
(Abrahams and Hensel, 2006). The exact function of these
filaments is unknown but it is thought that they play a role
in intracellular replication of salmonellae. Effector proteins
also appear to protect intracellular organisms from
bactericidal compounds produced by the host cell such as
reactive oxygen intermediates. In addition to these
mechanisms which protect intracellular bacteria, SPI-2
mediates a process which prevents phagolysosome fusion.
Resistance to digestion by phagocytes and to the lethal
action of complement components facilitates the spread of
organisms within the host. Virulence genes encoded by
plasmids, including the spv gene, which is important for
intracellular multiplication and other genes, which encode
serum resistance, play a role in systemic invasion (Foley
and Lynne, 2008). Resistance to killing by complement is
727
partly dependent on the length of O antigen chains of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Long chains of LPS prevent the
components of the membrane attack complex from
interacting with and damaging the bacterial cell membrane
(Salyers and Whitt, 1994). The LPS is also responsible for
the endotoxic effects of infection with salmonellae. It may
contribute  to  the local inflammatory response which
damages intestinal  epithelial  cells and  results  in the
development of diarrhoea. Bacterial cell wall LPS also
mediates the endotoxic shock which may accompany
septicaemic salmonellosis. Production of exotoxins by
Salmonella  serotypes  has   not
tbeen  definitively
demonstrated although an RTX (repeats in toxin)-like
protein has been demonstrated in serovar Typhi (Parkhill
et al., 2001).
Clinical infections
Salmonellosis is of common occurrence in domestic
animals and the consequences of infection range from
subclinical carrier status to acute fatal septicaemia. Some
Salmonella serotypes such as Salmonella Pullorum and
SalmonellaGallinarum
in  poultry,
Salmonella
Choleraesuis in pigs and Salmonella Dublin in cattle are
relatively  host-specific.  In   contrast,  Salmonella
Typhimurium has a comparatively wide host range. It is
recognized that healthy adult carnivores are innately
resistant to salmonellosis
Salmonellae often localize in the mucosae of the ileum.
caecum and colon and in the mesenteric lymph nodes of
infected animals. Although most organisms are cleared
from the tissues by host defence mechanisms, subclinical
728
infection may persist with shedding of small numbers of
salmonellae in the faeces. Latent infections, in which
salmonellae are present in the gall bladder or mesenteric
lymph nodes but are not excreted, also occur. Clinical
disease may develop from subclinical and latent infections
if affected animals are stressed. The stress factors which
have been most often associated with the development of
clinical salmonellosis are listed in Box 24.2. Some of these
factors, such as transportation and overcrowding, have
proved to be significant in outbreaks of the disease in
young animals and in adult sheep and horses. When
salmonellosis occurs in adult cattle it is usually sporadic
and is also often associated with stress.
Other factors that determine the clinical outcome of
infection include the number of salmonellae ingested, the
virulence of the infecting serotype or strain and the
susceptibility of the host. Host susceptibility may be
related to immunological status, genetic make-up or age.
Young and debilitated or aged animals are particularly
susceptible and may develop the septicaemic form of the
disease.
In most animal species, both enteric and septicaemic forms
of salmonellosis are recorded. A number of serotypes have
been associated with abortion in farm animals, often
without other obvious clinical signs in dams. The

Enteric salmonellosis
Enterocolitis caused by Salmonella organisms can affect
most species of farm animals, irrespective of age. Acute
disease is characterized by fever, depression, anorexia and
profuse foul-smelling diarrhoea often containing blood,
mucus and epithelial casts. Dehydration and weight loss
follow and pregnant animals may abort. Severely affected
young animals become recumbent and may die within a
few days of acquiring infection. On farms with endemic
salmonellosis, the milder clinical signs often observed may
be attributed to the influence of acquired immunity.
Chronic enterocolitis can follow acute salmonellosis in
pigs, cattle and horses. Intermittent fever, soft faeces and
gradual weight loss leading to emaciation are common
features of this condition.
Septicaemic salmonellosis
The septicaemic form can occur in all age groups but is
most common in calves, in neonatal foals and in pigs less
than 4 months of age. Onset of clinical disease is sudden
with high fever, depression and recumbency. If treatment
is delayed, many young animals with septicaemic
732
salmonellosis die within 48 hours. Surviving animals can
develop persistent diarrhoea, arthritis, meningitis or
pneumonia.
In   pigs  with   septicaemic Salmonella  Choleraesuis
infection, there is a characteristic bluish discoloration of
the ears and snout. Intercurrent viral infections often
predispose to severe clinical forms of the disease. The
close clinical and pathological relationships which have
been recognized in animals infected with Salmonella
Choleraesuis ((hog-cholera bacillus') and with classical
swine fever virus, either jointly or separately, exemplify
both the importance of intercurrent infections and the
difficulty of clinically distinguishing the diseases caused
by these agents.
Salmonellosis in poultry
Salmonella Pullorum,
，Salmonella  Gallinarum  and
Salmonella Enteritidis can infect the ovaries of hens and
can be transmitted through eggs. The presence of
Salmonella Enteritidis in undercooked egg dishes may
result in human food poisoning (Cooper, 1994).
Pullorum disease or bacillary white diarrhoea (Salmonella
Pullorum) affects young chicks and turkey poults up to 2
to 3 weeks of age. The mortality rate is high and affected
birds huddle under a heat source, are anorexic and
depressed and have whitish faecal pasting around their
vents. Characteristic lesions include whitish nodes
throughout the lungs and focal necrosis of liver and spleen.
733
Fowl typhoid (Salmonella Gallinarum) can produce lesions
in young chicks and poults similar to those of pullorum
disease. However, in countries where fowl typhoid is
endemic, a septicaemic disease of adult birds occurs, often
resulting in sudden deaths. Characteristic findings include
an enlarged, friable, bile-stained liver and enlarged spleen.
As Salmonella Pullorum and Salmonella Gallinarum
possess similar somatic antigens (Table 24.5), both have
been eradicated from many countries by a serological
testing and slaughter policy for pullorum disease.

·A history of previous outbreaks of the disease on the
premises, the age group affected and the clinical picture may
suggest salmonellosis.
·At post-mortem, enterocolitis with blood-stained luminal
contents and enlarged
1mesentericlymphnodesare
commonly observed.
·  Laboratory  confirmation  is  required. Specimens for
submission should include faeces and blood from live
animals. Intestinal contents and samples from tissue lesions
should be submitted from dead animals and abomasal
contents from aborted ruminant foetuses.
·Isolation of salmonellae from blood or parenchymatous
organs is deemed to be confirmatory for septicaemic
salmonellosis.
·A heavy growth of salmonellae on plates directly inoculated
with faeces, intestinal contents or foetal abomasal contents
strongly suggests the aetiological involvement of the
pathogen. Recovery of small numbers of salmonellae from
faeces is usually indicative of a carrier state.
· Because clinical specimens for the diagnosis of enterocolitis
due to Saimonella serotypes frequently contain other
contaminating flora, specimens should be cultured directly
on to BG and XLD agars and also added to selenite F.
Rappaport or tetrathionate broth for selective enrichment and
subsequent subculture (Fig. 24.6). The plates and enrichment
broth are incubated aerobically at 37°C for up to 48 hours.
Rappaport-Vassiliadis brothis  incubated at 41.5°C.
Subcultures are made from the enrichment broth at 24 and
48 hours. If animals are to be tested for subclinical carriage
of Salmonella serotypes, or environmental samples are being
investigated and small numbers of organisms are expected to
be present, non-selective enrichment by overnight incubation
in a broth such as buffered peptone water may be carried out
before the selective enrichment step.
detection  of salmonellae  in  clinical  and   environmental
samples, a major advantage being the speed with which a
result can be obtained. PCR and real-time PCR-based tests
735
can be applied directly to samples or, if very small numbers
of organisms are expected, samples can be enriched first and
PCR performed on the overnight enrichment culture.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
- On brilliant green agar, colonies and medium are red
indicating alkalinity. On XLD agar, colonies are red
(alkaline) with a black centre, indicating H2S production.
- Suspicious colonies, subcultured from the selective media
into TSl agar and lysine decarboxylase broth, should be
examined after incubation for 18 hours at 37°C to establish
their biochemical identity as Saimonella (Tables 24.l and
24.2).
If reactions in TSI agar and lysine decarboxylase broth are
inconclusive, a biochemical profile using a battery of
biochemical tests may allow definitive identification.
-The isolates from the TSl agar slant are confirmed as
Salmonella using commercially available antisera for O and
H antigens in a slide agglutination test. Serotypes with O
antigens in common are assigned to a serogroup (Table
24.5
- Serotypes which have flagellar (H) antigens in two phases.
phase 1 (specific) and phase 2 (nonspecific), are termed
diphasic. The antigens in both phases must be determined.
The majority of organisms in these serotypes usually possess
H antigens in a single phase and are agglutinated by the
appropriate antiserum. However, a minority of bacteria,
invariably present in the alternative phase, can be selected by
a procedure referred to as 'phase changing' (Fig. 24.7).
Although the term ‘phase changing' is used to denote the
procedure illustrated in Fig. 24.7, *phase selection? would be
a more accurate term. When the alternative phase is isolated,
the antigenic formula used for serotyping can be completed.
736
 Biotyping is required for serotypes which are antigenically
indistinguishable such  as Saimonella  Pullorum  and
Saimonella Gallinarum (Table 24.6).
· Phage typing is used in epidemiological studies to identify
isolates with specific characteristics suchas multiple
resistance to antibiotics and enhanced virulence. Examples

Antibiotic therapy  should be based on results
of
susceptibility testing because R-plasmids coding for multiple
resistance are comparatively common in salmonellae.
739
· Oral antimicrobial therapy should be used judiciously for
treating enteric salmonellosis because it may disturb the
normal intestinal flora, extend the duration of Saimonella
excretion and increase the probability of drug resistance
developing. In the septicaemic form of the disease,
intravenous antibiotic therapy must be used.
· Fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy is required to
counteractdehydration and shock
·Aswithothermembers
oft
the
Enterobacteriaceae
antimicrobial resistance, including resistance to multiple
antimicrobial classes, is a major problem in both human and
animal Saimonella isolates. Many countries document the
occurrence of resistance in Saimonefla isolates each year and
resistance trends can be monitored. Reports from many
countries record a high level of multiple resistance. In the
period 1999 to 2005, a significant increase in resistance to
tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and sulphonamides
was seen in Salmonella Typhimurium isolated from pigs in
Denmark and coincided with an increase in the use of these
antibacterial drugs in the pig industry (DANMAP, 2005). In
the USA, 44% of Saimonella isolates from abattoir and
diagnostic sources were resistant to at least one antimicrobial
agent (Anon., 2006). Recent increases in extended spectrum
      i r
is of particular concern as ceftriaxone is an important drug
for treating systemic salmonellosis in children under 16
years (Foley and Lynne, 2008). Antibacterial resistance can
be transferred between salmonellae and related organisms.
Of even greater concern is that plasmids encoding both
antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors can be formed
and strains containing such plasmids may be selected for by
inappropriate  antimicrobial usage. If such changes  in
resistance and virulence were to emerge, they could present
(Fluit, 2005).
Control
740
Control is based on reducing the risk of exposure to
infection. Intensively reared food-producing animals are
more likely to acquire infection than free-range birds or
mammals and such infected animals are also a major
source of human infection (Cooper, 1994).
· Measures for excluding infection from a herd or flock free of
salmonellosis:
- A closed-herd policy should be implemented  when
feasible.
- Animals should be purchased from reliable sources and
remain isolated until negative for Saimonella on three
successive samplings at weekly intervals.
-Steps should be taken to prevent contamination of
foodstuffs and water. In this context, rodent control is
im portan t.
- Protective clothing and footwear should be worn by
personnel entering hatcheries and minimal disease pig units.
· Measures for reducing environmental contamination:
- Effective routine cleaning and disinfection of buildings
and equipment are essential.
- Overstocking and overcrowding should be avoided.
- Slurry should be spread on arable land where possible. An
interval of at least 2 months should elapse before grazing
commences on pastures following the application of slurry.
- The continuous use of paddocks for susceptible animals
should be avoided.
· Strategies for enhancing resistance and reducing the
likelihood of clinical disease:
741
- Vaccination procedures are used in cattle, sheep, poultry
and pigs. Modified live vaccines which stimulate humoral
immunity and cell-mediated immunity are more efficacious
sub-unit vaccines are safer. Vaccination against serotypes
which cause systemic disease is more successful than against
non-host-adapted serotypes in which prevention of intestinal
colonization is the goal. However, vaccination is used as a
component of Saimoneila control programmes in poultry in
several countries. Modern molecular techniques are likely to
lead to the development of more effective safer vaccines
(Barrow, 2007).
- Colonization inhibition or competitive exclusion, which
newly hatched chicks, is successfully used to prevent
Saimonella infection in poultry. In addition, research is
ongoing to find a live attenuated Salmonella strain which
could be administered orally to day-old chicks and which
virulent Safmoneffa organisms (Barrow, 2007)
- The impact of stress factors (Box 24.2) should be reduced
by appropriate decisions relating to management of animals
and surgical or therapeutic intervention.
 Feeding of antimicrobial drugs for either prophylaxis or
growth promotion should be avoided where possible.
Measures for controlling outbreaks of salmonellosis:
- Detection and elimination of the source of infection is
essential.
- Clinically affected animals should be isolated.
- Movement of animals, vehicles and humans should be
Curtailed.
742
- Foot baths containing suitable disinfectant, such as 3%
iodophor, should be placed at strategic locations to limit
spread of Salmonella.
- Careful disposal of contaminated carcasses and bedding is
mandatory.
- Contaminated buildings and utensils should be thoroughly
cleaned and disinfected. The choice of disinfectant is
determined by the size and cleanliness of the building and
the nature of the utensils. A3% concentration of sodium
hypochlorite or iodophors is suitable for clean surfaces.
Phenolic disinfectants are suitable for buildings with residual
organic matter. Fumigation with formaldehyde is the most
effective method for disinfecting poultry houses.
- Herd vaccination may be of value for limiting the spread
of infection during outbreaks of disease in cattle (Wray,
1991).
 Humans working with clinically-affected animals should
be aware of the risk of acquiring infection.
Yersinia species
      
        
there are more than 10 Yersinia species, only Y. pestis, Y.
enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are pathogenic
for animals and humans (Table 24.7). Yersinia ruckeri
causes perioral haemorrhagic  inflammation  in some
species of fish. Growth of yersiniae tends to be less rapid
than other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. They
characteristically  demonstrate
ebipolarstaining

Giemsa-stained smears from animal tissues.
743
Serotyping and biotyping methods are used for identifying
pathogenic yersiniae. Of the 21 serological groups of Y.
pseudotuberculosis, serotypes I, II and IHl contain the
majority of pathogenic isolates. There are five biotypes
and more than 50 serotypes of Y. enterocolitica. Somatic
antigens 2, 3, 5, 8 and 9 are present in isolates from
clinical infections caused by this species. Serotype O:9 is
of particular importance  because  it  shares  common
antigens with

mammals, birds and domestic animals. All these animals
may be reservoirs of infection. Many avian species may
act as amplifier hosts and may also transfer the organisms
mechanically (Cork et al., 1995). Both organisms can grow
in a wide temperature range (5 to 42°C) and survive for
long periods in cool wet conditions.
In endemic areas, wild rodents are important reservoirs of
Y. pestis. Fleas, especially Xenopsylla cheopis, the Oriental
rat flea, transmit the infection to humans and other
animals.Following
 ngestion
by the flea from a
bacteraemic host, the organism multiplies within the
gastrointestinal tract of the flea resulting in blockage of the
tract. This effectively deprives the flea of nutrients, which
drives it to continually seek other animals on which to
feed. During feeding the flea regurgitates yersiniae into the
bite wounds on these new hosts.Yersinia pestis is
maintained by a sylvatic cycle in wild rodents and their
associated fleas, and although dog and cat fleas may
become infected with Y. pestis they do not transmit
infection effectively.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
and survival within macrophages is important particularly
in the early stages of infection. Later in the disease
process, large numbers of extracellular organisms can be
745
demonstrated and survival appears to be dependent in part
on inhibition of phagocyte function. The three pathogenic
Yersinia species possess virulence factors encoded on
plasmids and chromosomes, some of which are common to
all three species. However, Y. pestis produces extra
virulence factors and is more pathogenic than Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica, which rarely
produce  generalized
I infections.
The pathogenetic
mechanisms in enteric disease caused by Y. enterocolitica
and Y. pseudotuberculosis are incompletely understood
  qn son a o a  ssuo qo
of Peyer's patches. Adhesion to and subsequent invasion
through these cells are facilitated by factors such as invasin
and adhesion/invasion proteins which have an affinity for
integrins on cell surfaces. Once in the mucosa, the bacteria
   r  s   
are transported to the mesenteric lymph nodes (Brubaker,
1991). Survival within macrophages may be by prevention
of acidification of the Yersiniacontaining vacuole, which
has been shown to occur with Y. pestis (Pujol et al., 2009).
Replication in the
lymphnodes follows withthe
development of necrotic lesions and neutrophil infiltration.
A key virulence factor of all three pathogenic Yersinia
species is a type IfI secretion system which is encoded on a
plasmid called pYV. Similar to the TTSS found in
Salmonella serotypes, this TTSS allows effector proteins
to be translocated into host cells. These effector proteins
are termed Yersinia outer proteins or Yops and several of
with phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen
species (Cornelis, 2002).
746
Yersinia pestis, which is more invasive than Y.
pseudotuberculosis
andY.
enterocolitica,possesses
additionalvirulence factors encoded on two plasmids
which are specific to this pathogen. Production of an
antiphagocyticproteincapsule
(Fraction1)anda
phospholipase D is encoded on one of the plasmids, and a
plasminogen activator  which aids systemic  spread  is
encoded on the second plasmid. The phospholipase D
enzyme is essential for survival of the organism in the
midgut of fleas which transmit disease. Endotoxin, with
properties similar to the endotoxin produced by other
members of the Enterobacteriaceae, also contributes to the
pathogenesis of disease.
Y. pestis and some serotypes of Y. pseudotuberculosis and
Y. enterocolitica contain a chromosomal element, the
high-pathogenicity island, which encodes genes facilitating
iron acquisition.
Clinical infections
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis causes enteric infections in a
wide variety of wild and domestic animals which are often
subclinical. The septicaemic form of disease, known as
pseudotuberculosis, can occur in laboratory rodents and
aviarybirds. Sporadic abortionscausedbyY
pseudotuberculosis have been reported in cattle (Jerrett
and Slee, 1989), sheep (Otter, 1996) and goats (Witte and
Collins, 1985).
Wild and domestic animals may act as reservoirs of
Yersinia enterocolitica which is primarily a human enteric
pathogen. The pig is the natural reservoir for Y
747
enterocolitica serotype O3 biotype 4, which is an
important pathogen in humans. Rare cases of enteric
disease, precipitated by stress, may be encountered in pigs,
farmed deer, goats and lambs. Yersinia enterocolitica has
been implicated in sporadic ovine abortion (Corbel et al.,
1990).
Yersinia pestis, the cause of human bubonic plague (black
death'), can infect both dogs and cats in endemic areas.
Cats, which are particularly susceptible, may be a source
of infection for owners and attending veterinarians
(Kaufmann et al., 1981; Orloski and Lathrop, 2003)
Enteric yersiniosis
Enteritis caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis is relatively
common in young farmed deer in New Zealand and
Australia (Henderson, 1983 ; Jerrett et al., 1990).
Outbreaks of the disease have been reported also in
buffaloes in Brazil (Riet-Correa et al., 1990). Enteric
disease has been reported in sheep, goats and cattle under 1
year of age. Subclinical infection in many species is
common, and clinical disease may be precipitated in the
        
weaning, transportation and cold wet conditions. There
may be prolonged survival of Y. pseudotuberculosis on
pasture in cold wet weather, facilitating faecal-oral
transmission.
Enteritis in young deer and lambs is characterized by
profuse watery diarrhoea, sometimes bloodstained, which
may be rapidly fatal if untreated. The luminal contents of
the small and large intestine are watery, and mucosal
748
hyperaemia  is evident at postmortem examination.
Severely affected animals may show mucosal ulceration.
The mesenteric lymph nodes are often enlarged and
oedematous, and scattered pale necrotic foci may be
present in the liver.
A clinically similar but less severe enterocolitis caused by
Y. enterocolitica has been described in young ruminants.

pseudotuberculosis or, occasionally, Y. enterocolitica:
- Samples from tissues can be plated directly on to blood
agar and MacConkey agar and incubated aerobically at 37°C
for up to 72 hours.
- Faecal samples should be plated directly on to special
selective media containing antibiotics which suppress the
growth of contaminating organisms.
- A cold enrichment procedure may facilitate recovery of
yersiniae from faeces, especially if they are present in low
numbers. A 5% suspension of faeces in phosphate buffered
saline, held at 4°C for 3 weeks, is subcultured weekly on to
MacConkey agar or selective agar.
·Serotyping may be necessary to establish whether or not the
isolates belong to known pathogenic serotypes. As
conventional  serotyping is  a  laborious  and  expensive
procedure, PCR-based identification techniques have been
developed (Bogdanovich et af., 2003 ; Jacobsen et af., 2005)
749
·Many PCR-based methods have been published for detection
of the enteropathogenic yersiniae, particularly for the
detection of Y. enterocolitica which is an important
food-borne pathogen in some parts of the world
(Fredriksson-Ahomaa et al., 2000; Fukushima et af., 2003).
Treatment and control
ds  a    m
antimicrobial treatment should be initiated promptly  in
young animals.
·A formalin-killed Y. pseudotuberculosis vaccine composed
of serotypes I, II and IIl, administered in two doses 3 weeks
apart, has been shown to decrease the occurrence of clinical
disease in young deer. Recent developments include the
successful use of a recombinant intranasal vaccine which
provides mucosal and systemic protection against  Y.
pseudotuberculosis in mice (Daniel et al., 2009).
·Stressful conditions  should,  where  practicable,  be
mimimized.
Septicaemic yersiniosis
Septicaemia, caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis, occurs in
birds kept in cages or aviaries. It is presumed that infection
is acquired through contact with the faeces of wild birds or
rodents, or through the feeding of contaminated leafy
plants. In aviaries, overcrowding may predispose to the
development of disease. Infected birds may die suddenly.
Some may display ruffling of feathers and listlessness
shortly before death. Pin-point white necrotic foci are
present in the liver at post-mortem examination.
Confirmation is based on the isolation and identification of
Y. pseudotuberculosis from the liver and other internal
organs.
750
Treatment is seldom feasible due to the acute nature of the
disease. Control should be aimed at preventing faecal
contamination of food and water by wild birds and rodents
Pseudotuberculosis in laboratory animals
Infection  with  Y.  pseudotuberculosis  in  colonies  of
guinea-pigs or rodents is usually introduced through faecal
contamination of food by wild rodents. Diarrhoea and
gradual weight loss leading to emaciation and death are the
signs most often observed in affected animals. Some
animals may die suddenly from septicaemia
At post-mortem examination, numerous white necrotic
lesions are present in the liver. Affected
mesenteric lymph nodes are enlarged and may show
caseous necrosis.
Treatment is usually undesirable because some animals in
the colony may become carriers and the organism is
zoonotic. Depopulation, disinfection and restocking are the
preferred control measures. Exclusion of wild rodents is an
essential  step   in    preventing   infection    with   Y
pseudotuberculosis.
Feline plague
Cats usually acquire infection with Y. pestis by ingestion
of infected rodents. Three clinical forms of the disease are
recognized: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. The
most common form of the disease is characterized by
enlarged lymph nodes (buboes) associated with lymphatic
drainage from the site of infection. Clinical signs include
751
fever, depression and anorexia. Affected superficial lymph
nodes may rupture, discharging serosanguineous fluid or
pus. Septicaemia may occur without lymphadenopathy and
is potentially fatal. Pneumonic lesions may result from
haematogenous spread.
Because cats with pneumonic lesions are a potential source
of human infection through aerosol generation, they should
be euthanized. Human infection can also be acquired
through cat scratches and bites and possibly through the
bites of fleas from infected cats. Care should be taken
when handling infected animals
Diagnosis
· Lymphadenopathy and severe depression in cats in endemic
areas may suggest feline plague.
Specimens from suspect cases should be sent to specialized
reference laboratories. Suitable specimens include pus, blood
and lymph-node aspirates.
·Giemsa-stained smears from abscesses or lymphnode
aspirates may reveal large numbers of bipolarstaining rods.
· Direct fluorescent antibody tests are carried out in reference
laboratories.
· PCR-based techniques, including real-time PCR, are
available for detection of Y. pestis in clinical and other
samples, such as fleas.
·A passive haemagglutination test, using Fraction lA antigen,
can be used on paired serum samples taken 2 weeks apart
from suspect cats. A substantial increase in the antibody
level is usually indicative of active infection.
Treatment and control
· Cats with suspected plague should be kept in isolation and
immediately treated for fleas to prevent those handling the
752
  s   a   s
form of the disease may respond to tetracyclines or
chloramphenicol   administered   parenterally.  Multidrug
resistance, mediated by a transferable plasmid, has been
reported in Y. pestis (Galimand et al., 1997), although the
majority of isolates of the organism remain susceptible to
most antibacterial agents (Galimand et af., 2006).
· In endemic areas, dogs and cats should be routinely treated
for fleas.
· Rodent control measures should be implemented after flea
control procedures are in place.
Opportunistic pathogens
This group of enterobacteria, which rarely cause enteric
disease in domestic animals, are sometimes involved in
localized opportunistic infections in diverse anatomical
locations.  Faecal contamination of the environment
accounts for widespread distribution of the organisms and
contributes to the occurrence of opportunistic infection.
Predisposing factors include intercurrent infection, tissue
devitalization and the inherent vulnerability of certain
organs.
These opportunistic invaders have characteristics which
may allow them to circumvent host defence mechanisms
and colonize and survive in affected organs. Klebsiella
capsular  material  which  may  inhibit  phagocytosis  and
enhance intracellular survival. Adhesins are of particular
importance in those bacteria that colonize the lower
urinary   tract.   Siderophores   produced
1bysome
opportunistic pathogens contribute to bacterial survival
when the supply of available iron in tissues is limited.
Some toxic effects of these opportunistic pathogens are
753
attributable to release of endotoxin from dead bacteria.
This can induce local and systemic changes which include
inflammatory responses, pyrexia, endothelial damage and
microthrombosis.

causes of metritis in mares; capsule types 1, 2 and 5 are
transmitted venereally.Proteus species and Klebsiella
species cause infections of the lower urinary tract in dogs.
Proteus species are often implicated in otitis externa in
dogs and sometimes in cats. A variety of factors may
predispose to this infection (see Chapter 45).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia species
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia mallei and B.
pseudomallei are Gram-negative rods (0.5 to 1.0 x 1 to
5um)
which
are
obligate
carbohydrates.  Most  isolates are oxidase-positive and
catalase-positive. They are motile by one or more polar
flagella, with the exception of B. mallei which is non-
motile. The majority of these organisms have no special
growth requirements and grow well on MacConkey agar.
Burkholderia mallei requires glycerol in media for optimal
growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, characterized by the
production of diffusible pigments, causes a variety of
opportunistic infections in a wide range of animals. A
number of other Pseudomonas species may be isolated
from clinical specimens. Pseudomonas fluorescens and P.
putida occasionally infect freshwater fish.
Burkholderia species, previously classified in the genus
Pseudomonas, include B. mallei, the cause of glanders, and
B. pseudomallei, the cause of melioidosis. Both diseases
are
 zoonoses.  Both species possess two  circular
chromosomes although those of B. mallei are smaller and
contain fewer genes than those of B. pseudomallei,
probably reflecting the host-adapted nature of B. mallei
Usual habitat
Pseudomonas species are environmental organisms that
occur
rworldwide inwater, soil and on plants.
767
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also found on the skin, on
mucous
membranes  andin faeces.Burkholderia
pseudomallei, which is found in soils, occasionally infects
animals and humans. Wild rodents can act as reservoirs of
this organism. It is widely distributed in some tropical and
subtropical regions of south-east Asia and Australia
Although B. mallei can survive in the environment for up
to 6 weeks, its reservoir is infected Equidae.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains can form up to four

organism, is produced by most strains and specifically
identifies P. aeruginosa. Pyocyanin-enhancing media are

available for isolates which are weak pyocyanin producers.
Pigment production is observed most clearly on media

Clinical infections
Burkholderia mallei, a major pathogen of Equidae, causes
both acute and chronic disease. It manifests mainly as
lesions in the skin and the respiratory tract. Infection with
B. pseudomallei can cause chronic suppurative lesions in
the lungs and other organs of a wide range of species. In
contrast, P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen which
may occasionally cause acute systemic disease.

infections
(Table

predisposing factors are associated with the occurrence of
many of these infections, some species, such as farmed
mink, appear to be particularly susceptible to the organism
(Long et al., 1980). Haemorrhagic pneumonia and
septicaemia, caused by P. aeruginosa, occurs sporadically

Fleece rot of sheep, a condition associated with heavy or
prolonged rainfall, has been reported from the UK and
Australia. Maceration of the skin surface following water
penetration of the fleece allows colonization by P.
αeruginosa resulting in sup-purative dermatitis. The bluish

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Because P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic organism.
defences. Examples include breaks in the skin due to
trauma, prolonged wetting as in the case of fleece rot in
sheep, or the presence of urinary or intravenous catheters.
The first stage of infection involves adherence and
colonization. Attachment to host cells is mediated by
fimbriae, mainly Type IV pili, during the initial phases of
attachment. Flagella and LPS also play a role in adherence.
Colonization and replication are aided by antiphagocytic
properties of exoenzyme S, extracellular slime and outer-
membrane
lipopoly-saccharides.Theproductionof
extracellular slime and biofilm formation are particularly
indwelling devices such as catheters. Resistance to
complement-mediated damage and the ability to obtain
iron from host tissues are additional virulence factors. The
pigments produced by some strains of Pseudomonas
function as siderophores.
Following invasion, tissue damage is caused by a variety
of extracellular toxins and enzymes. These include toxins
such as exotoxin A, phospholipase C and proteases.
Exotoxin A is a bipartite toxin with binding and toxic
components. The active component, once internalized in a
cell, blocks protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation and
elongation  of Factor2
with resultant cell  death.
Phospholipase C is a haemolysin. Proteases, including
elastase, mediate cell damage in the lungs and blood
vessels. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has both Type II and
Type III secretion systems. The Type III system is of
772
major importance; its toxic effects result from the action of
effector proteins which are injected into the host cells.
Four proteins which have been identified to date cause
cytotoxic effects in tissues and may also interfere with
neutrophil and macrophage function (Kerr and Snelling.
2009).  The  pigment pyocyanin  can directly accept
electrons from reducing agents, transfer them to oxygen
and generate reactive oxygen species, which results in
damage to host cells (Liu and Nizet, 2009).
Infection may remain localized  or  it may become
exoenzyme S, and systemic toxicity is attributed to
exotoxin A and endotoxin. Host defence mechanisms
against P. aeruginosa include opsonizing antibodies and
phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages
Diagnostic procedures
·Specimens for laboratory examination include pus,
respiratory aspirates, mid-stream urine, mastitic milk and ear
swabs.
· Blood agar and MacConkey agar plates, inoculated with
suspect material, are incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 to
48 hours.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
- Colonial morphology and characteristic fruity, grape-like
odour
- Pyocyanin production
- Lactose-negative, pale colonies on MacConkey agar
- Oxidase-positive

sequencing of the rRNA gene (Watson et al., 2003).
 Several molecular techniques can be used for strain typing of
Pseudomonas isolates including PFGE and
PCR-based techniques such as random amplification of
polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Pujana et al., 2000; Las Heras
et al, 2002).
Treatment and control
Predisposing causes and sources of infection should be
identified and, where possible, eliminated.
·Pseudomonas aeruginosa is extremely resistant to many
antibiotics and disinfectants and susceptibility testing should
be carried out on isolates. Intrinsic resistance is attributable
to low permeability of its outer membrane, multidrug efflux
pumps  and  the production of chromosomally-encoded
β-lactamases. In addition, organisms within biofilms are less
susceptible to the action of antimicrobial agents (Clutterbuck
et af., 2007). A combination of gentamicin or tobramycin
with either carbenicillin or ticaricillin may be effective
although the emergence of pan-resistant strains in human
medicine has been reported (Souli et af., 2008).
Vaccines may be required for farmed mink and chinchillas.
As  there are antigenic differences between strains,
polyvalent or autogenous formalin-killed bacterins should be
employed.  Humoral  antibody  induced by  a  polyvalent
(Cryz et al., 1987).
Glanders
Glanders, caused by B. mallei, is a contagious disease of
Equidae characterized by the formation of nodules and
ulcers in the respiratory tract or on the skin. Humans and
774
carmivores  are also  susceptible to infection.  Once
worldwide in distribution,  glanders has now been
eradicated from most developed countries, but sporadic

contaminated by nasal discharges of infected Equidae.
Less commonly, infection may be acquired by inhalation
or through skin abrasions. Infection by inhalation requires
extremely small numbers of organisms, which is one of the
reasons the organism is classified as a Category B
bioterrorist agent by the Centers for Disease Control, USA.
An acute septicaemic form of the disease is characterized
by fever, mucopurulent nasal discharge and respiratory
signs. Death usually follows within a few weeks. Chronic
disease is more common and presents as nasal, pulmonary
and cutaneous forms, all of which may be observed in an
affected animal. In the nasal form, ulcerative nodules
develop on the mucosa of the nasal septum and lower part
of the turbinates. A purulent, blood-stained nasal discharge
and regional lymphadenopathy are usually present. The
ulcers eventually  heal leaving  star-shaped scars.  The
respiratory form is characterized by respiratory distress
and the development of tubercle- like lesions throughout
the lungs. The cutaneous form, termed farcy, is a
lymphangitis in which nodules occur along the course of
the lymphatic vessels of the limbs. Ulcers develop and
discharge a yellowish pus. Chronically affected animals
may die after several months or may recover and continue
to shed organisms from the respiratory tract or skin
775
Carnivores may contract the disease by eating infected
carcasses (Galati et al., 1974).
Pathogenesis
Glanders in the horse is usually a chronic, disseminated,
debilitating disease. Much has been learned about the
pathogenic mechanisms of B. mallei following the
sequencing of its genome and the identification of genes
predicted to be involved in virulence. The organism has a
capsule, type III and type IV secretion systems, and
quorum sensing mechanisms. In addition, genes encoding
adhesion proteins and fimbriae have been identified.
Burkholderia mallei is capable of intracellular survival and
spread, and utilizes actinbased motility, similar to Listeria
monocytogenes (Larsen and Johnson, 2009). The presence
of B. mallei in the host gives rise to a hypersensitivity
reaction, the basis of the mallein test.
Diagnostic procedures
· In regions where the disease is endemic, clinical signs may
be diagnostic.
Specimens  for laboratory diagnosis  should  include
discharges from lesions and blood for serology. Specimens
must be processed in a biohazard cabinet.
Burkholderia mallei grows best on media containing
glycerol and most strains grow on MacConkey agar (Anon.,
2008). Plates are incubated aerobically at 37°C for 2-3 days.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
Colonial characteristics
 Majority of strains grow on MacConkey agar without

776
- Comparatively unreactive biochemically and non - motile
(Table 25.1)
- As commercially available biochemical test kits are not
useful for confirmation of identification, PCR and real-time
PCR techniques may be employed for this purpose (Anon.,
2008).
·Suitable serological tests include the complement fixation
test and agglutination techniques. A competitive ELISA has
been developed and found to have comparable sensitivity
and specificity to the CFT (Sprague et al., 2009).
·The mallein test is an efficient field test both for
confirmation and for screening in-contact animals. Mallein,
a glycoprotein extract of B. mallei, is injected intradermally
  s   m  moq  (r)
indicated by local  swelling and mucopurulent ocular
discharge after 24 hours.
Treatment and control
·A test and slaughter policy is enforced in countries where the
disease is exotic.
·In endemic areas, antibiotic therapy is inappropriate as
treated animals often become subclinical carriers.
· Effective cleaning and disinfection of all contaminated areas
must be carried out. Formalin (1.5%) or an iodophor (2.0%)
can be used, with a contact time of 6 hours.
Vaccines for use in humans are not currently available.
Because of the threat of bioterrorism, research in this area is
progressing (Larsen and Johnson, 2009).
Melioidosis
Melioidosis, caused by B. pseudomallei, is endemic in
tropical and subtropical regions of south-eastern Asia and
Australia where the organism is widely distributed in soil
and water. Infection may follow ingestion, inhalation or
777
skin contamination from environmental sources. The
bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen, and stress factors
or immunosuppression may predispose to clinical disease.
Many animal species, including humans, are susceptible
and subclinical infections may occur. Because infection is
usually disseminated, abscesses develop in many organs
including lungs, spleen, liver, joints and central nervous
system. Melioidosis is a chronic, debilitating, progressive
disease, often with a long incubation period. Clinical signs.
which are variable, relate to lesion severity and
distribution. In horses melioidosis, which can mimic
glanders, is often referred to as pseudoglanders.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
As with glanders, considerable progress in understanding
the pathogenesis of melioidosis has been made recently.
The aetiological agent shares many putative virulence
factors with B. mallei, including a capsule and Type IHI
and Type IV secretion systems (Larsen and Johnson,
2009). Extracellular products of B. pseudomallei such as
an exotoxin, a dermonecrotic protease and a lecithinase
have been implicated in disease production (Dance, 1990).
Both strain virulence and host immunosuppression may
influence the establishment and outcome of infection

Actinobacillus species
Actinobacillus species are non-motile, Gram-negative rods
(0.3 to 0.5 × 0.6 to 1.4 μm) which may be pleomorphic and
frequently have a coccobacillary appearance. These
facultative anaerobes ferment carbohydrates, producing
acid but not gas. Most species are ureasepositive and
oxidase -  positive.  Actinobacilli exhibit  some  host
specificity and are mainly pathogens of farm animals.
Currently, there are 18 species within the genus and those
of veterinary importance are presented in Fig. 26.1
The genus Actinobacillus is one of 15 genera within the
familyPasteurellaceae.
Based
 on  phenotypic
characteristics, classification of members of the family is
difficult. Recent minimum standards for the description of
members of the Pasteurellaceae have been described by
Christensen et al. (2007). These include phylogenetic
comparison of 16s rRNA gene sequences. Actinobacillus
seminis is not closely related to other members of the
genus but reclassification of this organism is awaiting
further study (Euzby, 2005).
Usual habitat
Actinobacilli are commensals on mucous membranes of
animals, particularly in the upper respiratory tract and oral
cavity. As actinobacilli cannot survive for long in the
environment, carrier animals play a major role in
transmission.
783
Key points
-Medium-sized, non-motile, Gram-negative rods
·Facultative anaerobes
· Most species are oxidase-positive and produce
urease
· Species of veterinary importance grow on
MacConkey agar, apart from Actinobacillus
pleuropneumoniae
- Commensals on mucous membranes
· Produce a wide range of disease conditions in
domestic animals
Differentiation of Actinobacillus species
Actinobacillus species can be distinguished by colonial
characteristics and biochemical reactions (Table 26.1) but
definitive identification increasingly relies on molecular
methods.
·On primary isolation on blood agar, colonies of A.
lignieresii, A. equuli, and A. suis exhibit cohesive properties
when touched with an inoculation loop. Colonies of A.
pleuropneumoniae, A. suis and A. equuli subspecies
haemolyticus are haemolytic.
·Growth and reactions on MacConkey agar:
- A. lignieresii, A. equuli and most strains of A. suis grow
well on MacConkey agar. Colonies of A. lignieresii are
initially pale, turning pink after 48 hours. Actinobacillus
equuli and A. suis ferment lactose, producing pink
colonies.
-A. pleuropneumoniae and A. seminis do not grow on
MacConkey agar.
784
·Commercially available biochemical kits or specialized test
methods can be used to differentiate Actinobacillus species.
Actinobacillus seminis, which
is  catalase-positive,  is
relatively inactive biochemically.
Serotyping of A. pleuropneumoniae isolates is based on
carried out using slide agglutination or geldiffusion tests.
Molecular tests which can distinguish differences between
certain serovars have been developed also. For example,

Clinical infections
Actinobacilli can cause a variety of infections in farm
animals including timber (wooden) tongue in cattle,
pleuropneumonia in pigs and systemic disease in foals and
piglets (Fig. 26.1).
786
Actinobacillosis in cattle
Actinobacillosis,
chronic
pyogranulomatous
inflammation of soft tissues, is most often manifest
clinically in cattle as induration of the tongue, referred to
as timber tongue. Potentially important lesions occur in the
oesophageal groove and the retropharyngeal lymph nodes
The aetiological agent, Actinobacillus lignieresii, is a
commensal of the oral cavity and the intestinal tract. It can
survive for up to 5 days in hay or straw. The organisms
enter tissues through erosions or lacerations in the mucosa
and  skin.  A localized pyogranulomatous response is
associated with club colonies containing the bacteria. In
addition, spread through the lymphatics to the regional
lymph
nodes
may
induce
pyogranulomatous
lymphadenitis. Virulence
 mechanisms are unknown.
Although the gene for production of a repeats - in -
structural - toxin (RTX) has been identified in the genome,
it does not appear to be expressed.
Bovine actinobacillosis is usually a sporadic disease,
although herd outbreaks of limited extent can occur
(Campbell et al., 1975). Animals with timber tongue have
difficulty in eating and drool saliva. Involvement of the
tissues of the oesophageal groove can lead to intermittent
tympany, and enlargement of the retropharyngeal lymph
nodes can cause difficulty in swallowing and stertorous
breathing. Lesions of cutaneous actinobacillosis may be
found on the head, thorax, flanks and upper limbs.
Animals  with  ulcerated  discharging
lesions
can
contaminate
the
environment.
Localized
pyogranulomatous lesions in the retropharyngeal lymph
nodes are often found at slaughter. Isolates of A. lignieresii
787
obtained from lesions in horses are phenotypically similar
to, but genetically different from, those in cattle and have
been designated Actinobacillus genomospecies 1.
Diagnosis
· Induration of the tongue is characteristic of the disease and
there may be a history of grazing rough pasture.
· Specimens for laboratory examination include pus, biopsy
material and tissues from lesions at postmortem.
· Gram-negative rods are demonstrable in smears from
exudates.
·Pyogranulomatous foci containing club colonies may be
evident in tissue sections.
· Cultures on blood agar and MacConkey agar are incubated
aerobically at 37°℃ for 24 to 72 hours.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
-- Small, sticky, non-haemolytic colonies on blood agar
- Slow lactose fermentation on MacConkey agar
- Biochemical profile (Table 26.1)
- Definitive identification is based on analysis of 16S
rRNA gene sequences.
Treatment and control
· Animals with discharging lesions should be isolated.
·Sodium iodide parenterally or potassium iodide orally is
effective.
· Potentiated sulphonamides or a combination of penicillin
and streptomycin are usually effective. Oral isoniazid for 30
days has been used in animals with refractory lesions.
788
·Rough feed or pasture which may damage the oral mucosa
should be avoided.
Infections in other animals caused by A. lignieresii
Cutaneous
actinobacillosisofsheep
presents
as
granulomatous lesions mainly on the head without tongue
involvement. Granulomatous mastitis in sows, bite wounds
in dogs and glossitis in a horse have been attributed to
infection with A. lignieresii (Baum et al., 1984). However,
it is likely that isolates obtained from other species of
animals were misclassified as A. lignieresii and were in
factotherspecies
within
 the  actinobacilli
Pasteurellaceae.
Pleuropneumonia of pigs
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the only organism
d      s  
Pleuropneumonia can affect susceptible pigs of all ages
and occurs in major pig-rearing regions worldwide. This
highly contagious disease occurs primarily in pigs under 6
months of age and appears to be increasing in prevalence
as a consequence of intensive rearing practices.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Acute
infection
presents
asanecrotizing
fibrinohaemorrhagic    pneumonia    with   pleuritis   and
pericarditis. In the more chronic stages, abscesses
associated with adhesive fibrinous pleuritis are common
findings (Rycroft and Garside, 2000).
789
Colonization represents the first phase of infection and A.
pleuropneumoniae initially colonizes the tonsils and also
binds to the cells of the lower respiratory tract. The
organism possesses fimbriae and other proteinaceous
structures such as fibronectin which facilitate adherence to
epithelial cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is also thought
to play a role in adhesion. Multiplication following
adherence is dependent on the ability of the organism to
obtain adequate nutrients, especially iron. Actinobacillus
pleuropneumoniae can obtain iron through the utilization
of heme products released by haemolysis and is capable of
obtaining iron from porcine transferrin also. Virulent
strains possess capsules which are both antiphagocytic and
avirulent (Bertram, 1990). Thus, capsules are important in
protection against
host
defence
mechanisms.
Both
neutrophils
and
macrophages
phagocytose
A.
pleuropneumoniae but only neutrophils are capable of
effectively
killing
these
organisms.
.Actinobacillus
pleuropneumoniae can survive within macrophages, in part
due to its thick capsule but also because of other factors
such as LPS and possession of superoxide dismutase. This
pathogen produces four related cytotoxins which belong to
the RTX cytolysin family and are designated ApxI to IV.
These toxins are the most significant virulence factors
produced by the organism and produce pores in cell
membranes. Different serovars
possess  
different
combinations of  toxins although
all
possessApxIV
(vanden Bergh, 2008a). The potency of the four toxins
differs, with ApxI and ApxII of particular pathogenic
significance. Thus, the virulence of different serovars
 g q  o p  n o  s
types, the toxins stimulate the release of inflammatory
790
mediators (MacInnes,  20l0). Neutrophils chemically
attracted to infected pulmonary tissue are damaged and
release lytic enzymes. Damage to endothelial cells and
activation of factor XII by LPS initiates the coagulation
and fbrinolysis systems, which leads to the formation of
microthrombi, localized ischaemic necrosis 
andthe
characteristic lesions of acute pleuropneumonia.
Clinical signs and epidemiology
Subclinical carrier pigs, which are encountered in
unaffected populations, harbour the organisms in the
respiratory tract and tonsillar tissues. Poor ventilation and
sudden drops in ambient temperature seem to precipitate
disease outbreaks. Aerosol transmission occurs in confined
groups. In outbreaks of acute disease, some pigs may be
found dead and others show dyspnoea, pyrexia, anorexia
and a disinclination to move. Blood-stained froth may be
present around the nose and mouth and many pigs show
cyanosis. Pregnant sows may abort. Morbidity rates can
range from 30 to 50% and case fatality rates may reach
50%. Concurrent infections with Pasteurella multocida
and mycoplasmas may exacerbate the condition. At
post-mortem, areas of consolidation and necrosis are found
in the lungs along with fibrinous pleurisy. Blood-stained
froth may be found in the trachea and bronchi
Diagnosis
·There may be a history of ventilation failure or a rapid drop
in environmental  temperatures prior to  an  outbreak of
pulmonary disease.
Specimens for laboratory examination  should include
tracheal washings or affected portions of lung tissue.
791
·Areas of haemorrhagic consolidation close to the main
bronchi and severe fibrinous pleuritis may suggest this
condition.
·Specimens, cultured on chocolate agar, specialized selective
media and blood agar, are incubated in an atmosphere of 5 to
10% CO2 at 37°℃ for 2 to 3 days.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
-- Small colonies surrounded by clear haemolysis
-No growth on MacConkey agar
-Positive CAMP test with Staphylococcus aureus
--Biochemical profile (Table 26.1).
· Fifteen serovars and two biotypes are recognized (vanden
Bergh et al., 2008a). [solates belonging to biotype 1 require
      (  
biotype 2 are NAD-independent. Serovars 1 and 5 are
divided into two subtypes and serovars 13 and 14 are found
only within biotype 2. The occurrence of serovars tends to
be associated with particular geographical regions (vanden
Bergh et al., 2008b) and those prevalent in a particular
region should be identified prior to the implementation of
vaccination programmes.
· Immunofluorescent or PCR-based techniques may be used to
demonstrate the organism in tissues (Christensen and
Bisgaard, 2004).
·Serological techniques, principally based on ELISA, can be
used for diagnosis and epidemiological investigation.
· Strain typing techniques employing molecular methods, in
have been developed (vanden Bergh et al., 2008b).
Treatment
792
·As antibiotic resistance is encountered in some strains,
chemotherapy should be based on the results of antibiotic
Susceptibility testing. However, the setting of specific
clinical  breakpoints   for   antibiotics  used  in   porcine
respiratory disease is not yet complete, and thus the criteria
used to determine susceptibility and resistance are usually
adopted from human medicine (Schwarz et al., 2008).
· Prophylactic administration of antibiotics to incontact pigs
may limit the severity of clinical disease.
Control
·The original vaccines developed for A. pleuropneumoniae
were polyvalent bacterins which induced protective
immunity but failed to prevent transmission or the
development of a carrier state. Research efforts have
concentrated on finding antigens that are conserved among
all serovars and could be used in subunit vaccines. Most
commercially available subunit vaccines contain Apx toxins,
frequently combined with other virulence factors such as
capsular antigen or outer membrane proteins (Ramjeet et al.,
2008). Development of live and DIVA (differentiating
infected  from  vaccinated animals) vaccines is under
investigation also (Ramjeet et al., 2008 ).
 Predisposing factors such as poor ventilation, chilling and
overcrowding should be avoided.
Sleepy foal disease
Sleepy foal disease is an acute, potentially
 fatal
septicaemia of newborn foals caused by Actinobacillus
equuli. The species is divided into two subspecies, equuli
and haemolyticus. Both subspecies cause disease in horses
but subspecies equuli has been isolated from septicaemia
and abortion in pigs also (Christensen and Bisgaard, 2004).
Although primarily a pathogen of foals, A. equuli
occasionally produces disease conditions, such as abortion,
793
septicaemia and peritonitis, in adult horses (Gay and
Lording, 1980). The organism is found in the reproductive
and intestinal tracts of mares. Foals can be infected in
utero or after birth, via the umbilicus. Affected foals are
febrile and recumbent. Death usually occurs in 1 to 2 days.
Foals which recover from the acute septicaemic phase may
develop polyarthritis, nephritis, enteritis or pneumonia.
Foals dying within 24 hours of birth have petechiation on
serosal surfaces and enteritis. Meningoencephalitis can be
detectable histologically. Foals which survive for 1 to 3
days have typical pin-point suppurative foci in the kidneys.
Actinobacillus equuli subspecies haemolyticus shows RTX
activity and the toxin is encoded by the eqx gene. This
gene has not been demonstrated in subspecies equuli.
Diagnosis
·History of the disease occurring on the premises in previous
seasons.
· The clinical signs in a neonatal foal may suggest the disease.
· Specimens should be cultured on blood agar and
MacConkey agar and incubated aerobically at 37°C for 1 to
3 days.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
-- Sticky colonies with variable haemolysis on blood agar
- Lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar
- Biochemical profile (Table 26.1).
· PCR for the direct detection of the organism in clinical
specimens is available (Pusterla et al., 2009 ).
794
Treatment and control
Unless the disease is detected early, antimicrobial therapy
is of little benefit.
· The organism is usually susceptible to streptomycin,
tetracyclines and ampicillin.
· Supportive treatment includes blood transfusion and
bottle-feeding with colostrum.
·Mares that have had affected foals should be monitored
closely at subsequent foalings.
·Good hygiene should be observed.

·Commercial vaccines are not available.
Actinobacillus suis infection of piglets
Actinobacillus suis may be present in the upper respiratory
tract of sows and piglets become infected by aerosols or
possibly through skin abrasions. The infection occurs
mainly in pigs under 3 months of age (Sanford et al., 1990)
but disease may occur in animals of all ages if the
organism is introduced into a naive high-health herd. The
organism may cause
pleuropneumoniasimilartoA.
may cause a variety
/ of disease conditions including
septicaemia, meningitis, enteritis, metritis and abortion.
Mortality may be up to 50% in affected litters. Clinical
signs include fever, respiratory distress, prostration and
paddling of the forelimbs. Petechial and ecchymotic
haemorrhages occur in many organs and there may be
evidence
 of interstitial
 pneumonia,   pleuritis,
meningoencephalitis, myocarditis and arthritis. An unusual
795
form of the infection in mature pigs has been reported.
with skin lesions resembling those of swine erysipelas
(Miniats et al., 1989). Knowledge of virulence factors is
incomplete but outer membrane protein A may play an
important role in initial colonization (Ojha et al., 2o10)
and the organism is known to produce RTX toxins Apx I
and ApxII (van Ostaaijen et al., 1997). Actinobacillus suis
isolates recovered from animals other than pigs are now
thought to have been identified incorrectly.
Diagnosis

- Definitive identification can be made using analysis of
16SrRNA gene sequences.
Treatment and control
Treatment should be based on antibiotic susceptibility
testing of isolates. The organism is usually susceptible to
ampicillin,  carbenicillin,  potentiated  sulphonamides  and
tetracyclines.
·Contaminated pens should be disinfected.

796
Actinobacillus seminis infection in rams
Actinobacillus seminis is a common cause of epididymitis
in young rams. The condition is endemic in New Zealand.
Australia and South Africa and has also been reported in
the USA and the UK (Sponenberg et al., 1982; Low et al.
1995). The organism is found in the prepuce, and
epididymitis  may  follow   an  ascending  opportunistic
infection. However, detailed knowledge of the sources and
modes of transmission of A. seminis is lacking and some
studies suggest that the ewe may be involved as an
intermediate carrier or through ewe- to - lamb transmission
(Al - Katib and Dennis, 2009). Abscesses form in affected
epididymides and there may be purulent discharge through
fistulae on to the scrotal skin. Virgin rams between 4 and 8
months of age are most commonly affected.
Diagnosis
 Specimens for laboratory examination should include pus,
· Specimens should be cultured on blood agar and incubated
aerobically at 37°C for 24 to 72 hours.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
-- Small pin-point, non-haemolytic colonies
- No growth on MacConkey agar
-- Catalase-positive
- Unreactive in many biochemical tests.
797
· PCR-based methods may be used for differentiation from
related organisms.
·Serological tests include the CFT and ELISA.
Treatment and control
A vaccine is not available. Recovered rams show much
reduced fertility and, if a high incidence of disease is
expected in a flock, prophylactic antibiotics in feed or
water may be indicated

Pasteurella
species,
Mannheimia haemolytica
  and
Bibersteinia trehalosi
Pasteurella and Mannheimia species are small (0.2 x 1-2
μm), non-motile, Gram-negative rods or coccobacilli
They are oxidase-positive facultative anaerobes, and most
species are catalase-positive.  Although  non-enriched
media will support their growth, these organisms grow best
on media supplemented with blood or serum. They usually
remain viable for only a few days on culture plates. Some
species, such as Mannheimia haemolytica,Bibersteinia
trehalosi and P. aerogenes, can tolerate the bile salts in
MacConkey agar. In smears from infected tissues stained
by the Giemsa method, pasteurellae exhibit bipolar
staining (Fig. 27.1).
The family Pasteurellaceae comprises 15 genera, seven of
whichcontain
organisms
of veterinaryimportance:
Actinobacillus, Avibacterium, Haemophilus, Histophilus,
Mannheimia,Pasteurella and Bibersteinia.These genera
share a number of common features, and some organisms
have been reclassified within these genera following
deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization studies and 16S rRNA
genesequencing.
Pasteurellatrehalosi(formerly
Pasteurella haemolytica biotype T) has been reclassified
as Bibersteinia trehalosi (Blackall et al., 2007). Isolates of
P. haemolytica previously known as biotype A have been
allocated to a new genus and renamed Mannheimia
haemolytica (Sneath and Stevens, 1990; Angen et al.,
1999). Pasteurella multocida, B. trehalosi and M.
803
haemolytica are major animal pathogens (Table 27.1). The
genera Actinobacillus,Histophilus and Haemophilus also
contain major pathogens of domestic animals (see
Chapters 26 and 29). Other Pasteurella and Mannheimia
species which have been isolated from domestic animals
and humans are presented in Table 27.2.
Key points
- Small Gram-negative rods
· Optimal growth on enriched media
· Non-motile,
oxidase-positive,
facultative
anaerobes
· Most species are catalase-positive
·Some species grow on MacConkey agar
· Bipolar staining is prominent in smears from

-  Commensals in the upper respiratory tract
·Respiratory pathogens
Usual habitat
Most Pasteurella, Bibersteinia and Mannheimia species
tract of animals. Their survival in the environment is
relatively short.
Differentiation
 of
Pasteurella,
Bibersteinia
 and
Mannheimia species
Pasteurellae and Mannheimia species can be distinguished
by colonial and growth characteristics, and by biochemical
reactions. Strains of P. multocida can be
804
differentiated by serotyping and biotyping, whereas M.
haemolytica and
1B. trehalosi strains are usually
differentiated by serotyping. In addition, a number of
molecular typing methods have been developed
[for
differentiating these pathogens.
· Colonial characteristics:
- P. multocida colonies are round, greyish, shiny and
non-haemolytic. Colonies of some pathogenic strains are
mucoid due to the production of thick hyaluronic acid
capsules. The colonies have a subtle but characteristic
sweetish odour.
-M. haemolytica,M.granulomatis and B.trehalosi
colonies are haemolytic and odourless.
- Colonies of the other Pasteurella species are round,
greyish and non-haemolytic except those of P. testudinis,
which are haemolytic.

Bacteria in Giemsa-stained blood smears from lesions have
this characteristic staining pattern.
805
·On MacConkey agar, M. haemolytica and B. trehalosi grow
as pin-point, red colonies. Most pathogenic Pasteurella
species do not grow on MacConkey agar.
·Biochemical methods for differentiating the main pathogenic
Pasteurella and Mannheimia species are summarized in
Table 27.3.
·Pasteurella and Mannheimia species are relatively active
biochemically:
-- Reactions in conventional biochemical tests are indicated
in Table 27.3.
- Commercially available biochemical test strips such as
API 20NE (BioMérieux) can also be used.
- In TSI agar slopes, a yellow slant and yellow butt
without H2S production are typical.
·Serotyping of Pasteurella and Mannheimia species
- The types (or serogroups) of P. multocida are identified
on the basis of differences in capsular polysaccharides
(Carter, 1955) and are designated A, B, D, E and F (Table
27.1). The organisms are further subdivided into about 16
[       
differences in cell wall lipopolysaccharides (Namioka and
Murata, 1961- Heddleston et al., 1972). Both capsular and
somatic antigens are used to designate a specific serotype.

- Seventeen serotypes of M. haemolytica/B. trehalosi are
recognized on the basis of extractable surface antigens. An
indirect
haemagglutination
test
or
a
   rapid
plate
agglutination test may be used to identify each serotype.
Serotypes 3, 4, 10 and 15 are classified as B. trehalosi; the
remaining serotypes are classified as M. haemolytica
except serotype 11 which is reclassified as M. glucosida.
 Biotyping of Pasteurella multocida is occasionally carried
out in epidemiological investigations but is not generally
used for diagnosis. In addition, the frequent occurrence of
unassigned biotypes limits the usefulness of biotyping
(Dziva et al., 2008). Three subspecies of P. muitocida are
recognized, namely P. multocida subspecies muitocida, P.
multocida subspecies septica and P. muitocida subspecies
809
gallicida. An additional subspecies, P. muitocida subspecies
tigris, has been proposed (Capitini e t al., 2002 ).
· Molecular typing methods using techniques such as 16S
rRNA  gene sequencing,
,amplified fragment length
polymorphism,
pulsed-field gel
electro-phoresis,
multi-locus sequence typing and other PCR-based methods
have been developed for investigating strains of Pasteurella
and Mannheimia species (Katsuda et al., 2003; Dziva et af.,
2008). Unfortunately a definitive correlation between
serotype and genotypic characteristics has not been
established and thus complete characterization of strains
requires both phenotypic and genotypic information.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
organisms, which are normally commensals of the upper
respiratory
 tract,
 may
invade
thetissuesof
immunosuppressed animals. Exogenous transmission can
also occur either by direct contact or through aerosols.
Whether  there
arei
inherent
differences
between
commensal and pathogenic strains is unresolved at present
(Dabo et al., 2007). Factors of importance in the
development   of  disease
include  adhesion of the
pas-teurellae to the mucosa and avoidance of phagocytosis
A number of adhesins have been described including
fimbriae, surface fibrils and filamentous haemagglutinins.
The capsule, particularly in type A strains, has a major
antiphagocytic role and may also function in adhesion in
some strains. Differences in capsular composition occur in
different serotypes. The capsule of types A and B is
composed of hyaluronic acid; that of type D contains
heparin and type F contains chondroitin. These compounds
are similar to those found naturally in the host species
colonized by the particular serotype and this molecular
810
mimicry limits the development of a strong immune
response to the organism. As with other bacteria, the
availability of iron is important for colonization and
multiplication of the organism and P. multocida has a
number of iron acquisition systems. The major virulence
factor of P. multocida strains of type D, which produce
atrophic rhinitis in pigs, is PMT toxin, a cytotoxic protein
that stimulates cytoskeletal rearrangements and growth of
fibroblasts. In
septicaemic
pasteurello-sis, 
severe
endotoxaemia and disseminated intravas-cular coagulation
cause serious illness which can prove fatal.
Four main virulence factors have been identified in strains
of M. haemolytica and B. trehalosi (Confer et al., 1990) :
adhesins which may enhance colonization; a capsule that
inhibits complemen^mediated destruction of the organisms
in serum; endotoxin which can alter bovine leukocyte
functions and is directly toxic for bovine endothelial cells;
leukotoxin, a pore-forming cytolysin that affects leukocyte
and platelet functions when present at low concentrations
and
 causes   cytolysis
at
thigh
1concentrations.The
subsequent release of lysosomal enzymes from damaged
cells together with inflammatory mediators, such as
tumour necrosis factor-o and eicosanoids, contributes to
severe tissue damage in these infections.
The major adhesins of M. haemolytica appear to be two
outer membrane proteins, OmpA and Lppl (Czuprynsk1.
2009) although the organism also has fimbriae and
enzymes such as sialoglycoprotease and neuraminidase
which may enhance colonization of the respiratory tract
(Rice et al., 2008 ). Once established in the lung, the
organism produces leukotoxin, which has potent effects on
811
ruminant neutrophils whereas neutrophils of other species
are resistant. The specificity is based on the ability of the
leuko-toxin to bind to the transmembrane receptor CD18, a
subunit of beta2-integrin. This receptor, when associated
with  CDlla,  is  expressed  as  the heterodimeric
glycoprotein  lymphocyte-function-associated  antigen  1
(LFA) 1) which is responsible for the high)affinity binding
of leukotoxin to ruminant leukocytes (Rice et al., 2008)
Binding initiates a series of intracellular events which
        n
cytochrome  c and ultimately  cell death  (Czuprynski,
2009). The importance of viral infections in predisposing
to infection with M. haemolytica is well known and recent
work has shown the possible mechanism behind this
observation. In vitro studies have shown increased
expression of LFA-lon
1 bovine peripheral blood
mononuclear cells infected
         
effects of M. haemolytica leukotoxin (Leite et al., 2004)
Diagnostic procedures
·There may be a history of exposure to stress arising from
transportation or overcrowding.
· Suitable specimens for laboratory examination from live
animals include tracheobronchial aspirates, nasal swabs or
mastitic milk.
· Tissue or blood smears from septicaemic cases, stained by
bipolar-staining organisms.
· Specimens should be cultured on blood agar and
MacConkey agar. Plates are incubated aerobically at 37°C
for 24 to 48 hours. Blood agar, supplemented with
neomycin, bacitracin and actidione, can be used for the
812
isolation of P. muitocida from heavily contaminated
specimens.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
-Colonial characteristics
- Growth on MacConkey agar
-- Positive oxidase test
- Biochemical profile
- PCR-based methods for the identification of colonies
phenotypically suggestive of Pasteurella or Mannheimia
species appear to be more reliable than biochemical
methods (Alexander et al., 2008; Dziva et al., 2008).
· Serological tests are generally of little diagnostic value in the
Mannheimia species.
Clinical infections
Clinical infections caused by pasteurellae and Mannheimia
species in domestic animals are mainly attributable to P.
multocida, M. haemolytica and B. tre-halosi (Table 27.1).
Pasteurella multocida has a wide host range whereas M.
haemolytica is largely restricted to ruminants and B.
trehalosi to sheep. The diseases associated with P.
multocida infection include haemor-rhagic septicaemia in
ruminants and occasionally in other domestic species,
porcine atrophic rhinitis, fowl cholera and bovine
pneumonic pasteurellosis. However, the main aetiological
agent   of  bovine  pneumonic  pasteurellosis  is  M.
haemolytica, and this organism is also responsible for
813
pneumonia in sheep and septicaemia in young lambs.
Infection withB. trehalosi
 frequently  results  in
septicaemia in older lambs.
Mannheimia haemolytica can cause a severe necrotiz-ing
mastitis in ewes, and both P. multocida and M.
haemolytica have been isolated occasionally from cases of
bovine mastitis. Both organisms have also been implicated
aetiologically  in  the  enzootic pneumonia complex of
calves.
Haemorrhagic septicaemia
Haemorrhagic septicaemia or barbone is an acute,
potentially  fatal septicaemia mainly affecting buffaloes
and cattle. Predisposing factors such as overwork, poor
body condition and monsoon rains are important in its
development. Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2 causes
the disease in Asia, the Middle East and some southern
European countries, while serotype E:2 is the cause in
Africa. However, the epidemiology of haem-orrhagic
septicaemia appears to have changed in recent years with a
decline in serotype E strains isolated in Africa and
increasing prevalence of type B strains (Dziva et al.,
2008). Serotypes B and E are the only P. multocida
serotypeswith
1 hyaluronidase  activity.  Haemorrhagic
septicaemia,  which
isof
considerableeconomic
importance in endemic regions, is notifiable in some
countries.
Buffaloes tend to be more susceptible to the disease than
cattle. All ages can be affected but in endemic areas the
       
814
months of age. Older animals may have a degree of
immunity from previous exposure. Many older animals are
latent carriers, with pasteurellae located in the tonsillar
crypts. Periodically, these animals shed P. multocida in
nasal secretions and in aerosols. Explosive outbreaks of
disease can occur if an active carrier is introduced into a
stressed, susceptible population
Clinical signs
The incubation period of the disease is 2 to 4 days and the
course ranges from 2 to 5 days. Death, without prior signs
of illness, may occur within 24 hours of infection. Sudden
onset of high fever, respiratory distress and a characteristic
oedema of the laryngeal region are features of the disease.
The oedema may extend to the throat and parotid regions
and to the brisket. Recumbency is followed by death from
endo-toxaemia. Mortality rates are usually over 50% and
can approach 100% (De Alwis, 1992).
Diagnosis
 A history of acute disease with high mortality in areas where
haemorrhagic septicaemia is endemic may suggest a
presumptive diagnosis of the condition.
·  Gross  pathological changes  may  include  widespread
petechial haemorrhages, enlarged haemor-rhagic lymph
nodes and blood-tinged fluid in the pleural cavity and the
pericardial sac.
· Giemsa-stained blood smears from a recently dead animal
often reveal large numbers of bipolar-staining organisms.
· Isolation, identification and serotyping the P. muitocida
isolate are confirmatory. Serotypes B:2 and E:2 are the
specific strains associated with the disease. A multiplex PCR
method  for  identification  of serotypes described   by
815
Townsend et af. (200l) has replaced the traditional indirect
haemagglutination assay in many laboratories.
·An antibody titre of 1:l60 or above inanindirect
haemagglutination test is indicative of recent exposure to the
pathogen.
Treatment and control
Antibiotic therapy in the early febrile stage is usually
effective. Although the organism is susceptible to penicillin,
tetracyclines are more often used.
·A slaughter policy for affected and in-contact animals is
usually pursued in countries where the disease is exotic.
Vaccines available for control of the disease include
bacterins and a live heterotypic vaccine (Myint and Carter,
1989). Modified live deletion mutant vaccines have been
developed also (Dalgleish et al., 2007 ).
· Latent carriers can be detected using immunohisto-chemical
techniques on samples of tonsillar tissue.
Bovine respiratory disease
Both shipping fever and enzootic pneumonia of calves are
associated with infection by M. haemolytica and P.
multocida. either separately or jointly. Shipping fever,
characterized by severe bronchopneumonia and pleurisy,
occurs most commonly in young cattle within weeks of
being subjected to severe stress, such as transportation,
assembly in feedlots and close confinement. The condition
is commonly associated with M. haemolytica, although P
multocida has also been isolated from lungs of affected
cattle. The principal serotype of M. haemolytica associated
with disease is Al although recent surveys
have
demonstrated the increasing importance of serotype A6 in
Europe and elsewhere (Donachie, 2000; Katsuda et al..
2008 ). The principal serotype of P. multocida isolated
816
from cases of respiratory disease in cattle is A3. While M.
the sole infecting agent in cattle, there is debate as to
whether P. multocida is a primary pathogen in bovine
respiratory disease or whether it merely acts as an
opportunistic invader with other pathogens (Dabo et al.,
2007).
 Several
respiratory
viruses
including
parainfluenzavirus 3, bovine herpesvirus 1 and bovine
respiratory syncytial virus may predispose to the bacterial
invasion. At post-mortem, the cranial lobes of the lungs are
red, swollen and consolidated. There is often an overlying
fibrinous pleurisy.
Clinical signs
Clinical features of shipping fever include sudden onset of
fever, depression, anorexia, tachypnoea and serous nasal
discharge. In mixed infections, there is usually a marked
cough and ocular discharge (Dalgleish, 1990). Morbidity
rates can reach 50% and mortality rates range from 1 to
10%. Enzootic calf pneumonia is classically described as
occurring in housed calves from 2 to 6 months of age with
morbidity rates of up to 30% and mortality rates of
between 5 and 10%.
Diagnosis
·There may be a history of exposure to stress factors and of
sudden onset of respiratory disease.
· Gross pathological findings are of diagnostic value.
 Cytospin preparations from bronchoalveolar lavage usually
reveal large numbers of neutrophils.
817
·Isolation of M. haemolytica, often in association with other
pathogens, from transtracheal wash samples or affected lung
tissue is confirmatory.
Treatment and control
·Affected animals must be isolated and treated early in the
course of the disease. Treatment with oxy-tetracycline,
effective.  However, increasing resistance to these
antimicrobial agents in M. haemofytica has been reported in
some countries (Hendriksen et af., 2008).
·Stress factors must be kept to a minimum. Procedures such
as castration, dehorning, branding and anthelminthic therapy
should be carried out several weeks before young cattle are
transported.
· Vaccination regimes for respiratory pathogens should be
completed at least 3 weeks before transportation. Vaccines
for M. haemolytica which incorporate modified leukotoxin
and surface antigens may induce protection. A vaccine
  o    
haemolytica Al and M. haemolytica A6 has been developed
(Schreuer et al., 2000) and recent research has concentrated
on
the development of vaccines for mucosal delivery (Rice et
al, 2007).
Pasteurellosis in sheep
Outbreaks of ovine pneumonic pasteurellosis are usually
caused by M. haemolytica whereas P. multocida tends to
produce sporadic cases of the disease. Mannheimia
haemolytica is a commensal of the upper respiratory tract
in a proportion of healthy sheep. Factors that predispose to
clinical disease are poorly understood and may include
adverse climatic conditions or concurrent infections with
respiratory viruses such as parainfluenzavirus 3. Flock
818
outbreaks usually start with sudden deaths of some sheep
and acute respiratory distress in others. Post- mortem
findings include ventral consolidation in the cranial lobes
of the lungs and fibrinous pleural and pericardial effusions.
Laboratory confirmation relies on isolation of a heavy
growth of M. haemolytica from lung lesions. Long-acting
oxytetracycline  is usually effective  for  treatment.
Multivalent bacterins are available and may be of value in
control programmes.
Septicaemic pasteurellosis in lambs less than 3 months of
age is caused by M. haemolytica. In older animals between
5 and 12 months of age, septicaemic pasteurellosis is
usually associated with B. trehalosi infection. Bibersteinia
trehalosi is found in the tonsillar tissues of carrier sheep.
As with most other pasteurella infections, clinical disease
may be precipitated by a range of predisposing factors
including transportation. Affected sheep which tend to be
mortality rate may approach 5%.
Atrophic rhinitis of pigs
Toxigenic strains of P. multocida type D or A cause a
severe, progressive form of atrophic rhinitis. These
toxigenic P. multocida isolates are
designatedAR+
(atrophic rhinitis-positive)
strains.
Infection   with
Bordetella bronchiseptica may cause mild, nonprogressive
turbinate atrophy without significant distortion of the
snout. However, the presence of this organism predisposes
to infection with P. multocida AR+. Other factors that may
predispose to infection include overstocking and poor
ventilation. Bordetella bronchiseptica and non-toxigenic
819
strains of P. multocida are widely distributed in pig herds
The introduction of a P. multocida AR+ carrier may
initiate an outbreak of progressive atrophic rhinitis in a
susceptible herd.  Although young pigs are particularly
vulnerable to infection, non-immune pigs of any age can
be infected by these toxigenic strains.
Clinical signs
Early signs, usually encountered in pigs between 3 and 8
weeks of age, include excessive lacrimation, sneezing and,
occasionally, epistaxis. The snout gradually becomes
shortened and wrinkled. As the disease progresses, a
distinct lateral deviation of the snout may develop (Rutter,
1989). Atrophic rhinitis is rarely fatal. Affected pigs are
usually underweight and damage to the turbinate bones
may predispose to secondary bacterial infections of the
lower respiratory tract.
Diagnosis
· In severely affected pigs, characteristic facial deformities are
diagnostic.
· Visual assessment of the extent of turbinate atrophy can be
made following slaughter by transverse section of snouts
between the first and second premolar teeth.
·Isolation and identification of P. muitocida should be
followed by tests to confirm that the isolate is a toxigenic
strain. Suitable tests include demonstration of toxicity for
tissue culture cells (Rutter and Luther, 1984; Chanter et af.,
1986), an ELISA test for toxin detection (Foged et al., 1988)
and the detection of the toxin gene by a polymerase chain
reaction technique (Nagai et af., 1994 ).
·A multiplex PCR for the detection of toxigenic and
non-toxigenic strains of P. muitocida and Bordetella
820
bronchoseptica has been developed by Register and DeJong
(2006).
·A multiplex PCR for the detection of toxigenic and
non-toxigenic strains of P. multocida and Bordeteila
 bronchoseptica has been developed by Register and DeJong
(2006).
Control
Chemoprophylaxis  with  sulphonamides,  trimetho-prim,
tylosin or tetracyclines in weaner, grower and sow rations
could be considered. However, resistance to these agents is
increasing worldwide (San Millan et al., 2009 ; Sellyei et af.,
2009 ; Tang et af., 2009) and antimicrobial susceptibility
testing of isolates should be carried out before antimicrobial
agents are administered for treatment or prophylaxis.
aq isnu juawgeueu pue Qipueqsny u! quawaaoiduj  
instituted to minimize the influence of predisposing factors
and to reduce reliance on antimicrobial agents.
Vaccination with a combined B. bronchiseptica bacterin and
P. muftocida toxoid may reduce the severity of the disease
and improve growth rates (Voets et al., 1992). Sows should
be vaccinated at 4 and 2 weeks before farrowing and young
piglets at I week and 4 weeks of age.
Fowl cholera
Fowl cholera is a primary avian pasteurellosis caused by P.
multocida capsular types A and F. It is highly contagious
and affects both domestic and wild birds. The disease
usually presents as an acute septicaemia which is often
fatal. Turkeys tend to be more susceptible than chickens.
Post-mortem lesions include haemorrhages on serous
surfaces and accumulation of fluid in body cavities. In
sporadic chronic cases of the disease, the signs and lesions
are often related to localized infections. The wattles.
821
accumulation of fibri-nopurulent exudates.
In the acute septicaemic form of the disease, numerous
characteristic bipolar- staining organisms can be detected
in blood smears and P. multocida can be isolated from
blood, bone marrow, liver or spleen. The bacterium may
be difficult to isolate from chronic lesions.
Medication of the feed or water early in an outbreak of
acute disease may decrease the mortality rate. Polyvalent
adjuvant bacterins are widely used and usually contain the
most commonly isolated sero-types, 1, 3 and 4 (Anon.,
2008). Autogenous vaccines may be required if the
commercial   vaccines  are   ineffective.   Modified  live
vaccines are available in some regions of the world,
including North America.
Snuffles in rabbits
Snuffles is a common, recurring, purulent rhinitis in
rabbits which is caused by type A strains of P. multoc-ida.
Bordetella bronchiseptica infection may sometimes cause
similar clinical
signs.Pasteurellamultocidais a
commensal in the upper respiratory tract of healthy carrier
rabbits. Clinical disease is often precipitated by stress
factors such as overcrowding, chilling, transportation,
concurrent infections and poor ventilation, resulting in
high levels of atmospheric ammonia. There is a purulent
nasal discharge which cakes on the fore legs because
affected rabbits paw their noses. Sneezing and coughing
may be observed. Sequelae include conjunctivitis, otitis
media and subcutaneous abscessation. Bronchopneumonia
822
may develop in young rabbits. Treatment or prophylactic
therapy with antibiotics may be of value. Predisposing
stress factors must be eliminated. Commercial vaccines for
this disease are not available.

Francisella tularensis
Francisella
tularensis,  originally
classified
as a
Pasteurella
species,  is  a tiny, poorly  staining,
Gram-negative rod (0.2 x 0.2-0.7 μm) which tends to have
a coccobacillary appearance. It is an obligate aerobe.
non-motile, oxidase-negative and weakly catalase-positive.
This fastidious organism requires the addition of cysteine
or cystine to blood agar for growth. It does not grow on
MacConkey agar.
isolates from infected animals produce capsules. F.
tularensis   subspecies   tularensis   (formerly  subsp.
nearctica), which includes highly virulent type A strains
and were thought to occur only in North America, have
been reported in Europe (Gurycova, 1998). Less virulent
type B strains, F. tularensis subspecies holarctica
(formerly subsp. palaearctica), which are assigned to two
biogroups (Pearson, 1998), are found in both Eurasia and
North America (Fig. 28.l).  A third  subspecies,
mediasiatica, is occasionally associated with disease.
Distinguishing features of the two pathogenic subspecies
are presented in Table 28.1.

Causes tularaemia in animals and humans
Three other Francisella species, F. noatunensis,
，F
novicida and F. philomiragia, are pathogens of fish and
may occasionally be associated with human infections
(Hollis et al., 1989). In addition, there may be other, as yet
uncharacterized, environmental species of Francisella
(Berrada and Telford, 2010).

Usual habitat
Tularaemia has been reported in over 250 species of
mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and invertebrates. The
important reservoir hosts of F. tularensis for infection in
humans and domestic animals are not entirely clear but
probably include lagomorphs, rodents, galliform birds and
deer. A more accurate picture may be that these are
amplifying hosts and the true reservoir host is a tick (Foley
and Nieto, 2010). Francisella tularensis may survive for 3
to 4 months in mud, water and contaminated carcasses
(Rohrbach, 1988). Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis
is associated with terrestrial animals and subsp. holarctica
is frequently linked to waterborne infections and to aquatic
mammals
such
 as beavers and
1  muskrats. Unlike,
subspecies tularensis, the true reservoir of subspecies
holarctica is now considered to be a protozoan organism
rather than a mammal (Foley and Nieto, 2010 ).
832
Epidemiology
Ticks and the deerfly (Chrysops discalis) are important
vectors in North America. The main tick species, in which
F.tularensis
can
 be   passed    transstadially   and
transovarially, include  Dermacentor variabilis,  D.
ander-soni and Amblyomma americanum.At each stage of
their life cycles, these ticks usually feed on vertebrate
hosts different from and larger than the hosts parasitized at
the previous stage. Direct transmission between domestic
animals is uncommon.
Clinical infections
Francisella tularensis can infect wildlife species, domestic
animals and humans. Fulminating disease can occur in
immunosuppressed individuals. Chronic, granulomatous
lesions or subclinical infections may develop. Subspecies
ularensis strains probably account for the majority of
clinical infections in domestic animals while subspecies
holarctica strains tend to cause a comparatively mild
illness that may not be evident.
Tularaemia in domestic animals
Although infection with F. tularensis is probably common
in domestic animals in endemic areas, outbreaks of
tularaemia are relatively rare. Outbreaks of disease have
been reported in sheep (Frank and Meinershagen, 1961),
horses (Claus et al., 1959) and young pigs.
Adult pigs and cattle appear to be comparatively resistant
toinfection. Dogs and cats may be infected and
833
seroconvert without clinical signs of disease. In serological
surveys, significant antibody titres to the pathogen were
found in 6% of feral cats (McKeever et al, 1958) and 48%
of dogs (Schmid et al.,1983). Cats are probably the
domestic animal in which clinical disease has been most
frequently documented; infection is presumably acquired
through hunting. The forms of disease described in humans
occur in cats also, including typhoidal, respiratory,
ulceroglandular and oropharyngeal tularaemia.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Infection with F. tularensis usually occurs through skin
abrasions or by arthropod bites. Animals can also acquire
infection through inhalation or by ingestion. The organism
is a facultative, intracellular pathogen which can survive in
macrophages but not in neu-trophils. The organism enters
macrophages via a unique system of pseudopod loops
(Clemens et al., 2005). Once within the cell, the organism
inhibits phagosome/lysosome fusion and survives within
the phagosome up to several hours by suppression of
acidification (Barker and Klose, 2007). The organism then
escapes from the phagosome, replicates in the cytoplasm
and is released from the cell by induction of pyroptosis, a
form of apoptosis (Foley and Nieto, 2010). Many putative
virulence genes have been identified in the F. tularensis
genome but the molecular pathogenesis of this organism is
only partly known (Meibom and Charbit, 2010). However,
a Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI) has been
identified and encodes a putative Type IV secretion system
and other virulence genes. Two copies of this FPI are
found in virulent strains of F. tularensis; single copies are
found in less virulent species
834
Lymphadenitis, either local or generalized, is a constant
finding and septicaemia is common. Pale necrotic foci are
present in enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and miliary
lesions may be evident in the liver and spleen. Areas of
pulmonary consolidation may also be present. Primary
pulmonary lesions due to aerosol inhalation have been
described in affected cats.
Clinical signs
Outbreaks of tularaemia have been reported in sheep, and
disease has been described in cats and other domestic
animals. Transmission of infection often correlates with
heavy tick infestation.
   s  s   
fever, depression, inappetence, stiffness and other
manifestations of septicaemia.
Diagnosis
·Although clinical signs are non-specific, heavy tick
infestation in severely ill animals in endemic regions may
indicate the presence of tularaemia.
 o  i   s  
serology, scrapings from ulcers, lymph node aspirates and
biopsy  material  or  post-mortem  samples  from  affected
tissues.
·Agglutination antibody titres of l:80 or higher are
presumptive evidence of infection with F. tularensis. A
rising antibody titre is indicative of an active infection.
·A fluorescent antibody technique can be used for the
identification of F. tufarensis in tissues or exu-dates and
from cultures.
835
· Isolation procedures for F. tularensis must be carried out in
a biohazard cabinet. Special precautions should also be
observed when handling suspect cases of tularaemia and
during post-mortem examinations.
· Glucose-cysteine-blood agar is used for culture with the
addition of antibiotics when samples are contaminated.
Plates are incubated aerobically at 37°C for up to 7 days.
· Identification criteria for isolates
- Small, grey, mucoid colonies, surrounded by a narrow
zone of incomplete haemolysis, appear after incubation for 3
to 4 days.
Immunofluorescence can be used to confirm the identity of
the pathogen in smears from the colonies.
- A slide agglutination test can be carried out on cultures
using antiserum specific to F. tufarensis. Biochemical tests
for distinguishing the subspecies are carried out in reference
laboratories (Table 28.1).
- PCR procedures for identification and differentiation of
strains are increasingly used (Forsman et al, 1995; Anon.,
2008). Real-time PCR for rapid identification of isolates has
been developed also (Tomaso et af., 2007).
·Detection of F. tularensis in blood and other tissues by
      
(Long et al., 1993; Johansson et al., 2000).
·If samples contain few organisms, isolation in embryonated
eggs or laboratory animals can be attempted.
Treatment
Effective antibiotics include amikacin, streptomycin,
imipenem-cilastatin and   the  fluoroquinolones.  A  high
relapse rate may occur if animals are treated with
bacteriostatic antibiotics. Francisella tularensis produces a
836
β-lactamase and thus is not susceptible to penicillins. Broth
microdilution is the recommended method for testing of
isolates; antimicrobial resistance was not detected when
seven agents were tested in a recent North American study
(Urich and Petersen, 2008 )
Control
Defined control measures are required in endemic areas as
commercial vaccines are not available for use in animals.
·Ectoparasite control is essential. Daily removal of ticks from
dogs and cats is advisable.
·Precautions should be taken to prevent contamination of
food and water with infected carcasses or excreta of wildlife
species.
· I n endemic regions dogs and cats should be prevented from
hunting wildlife species.
Tularaemia in humans
Tularaemia in humans, a serious and potentially fatal
infection,  often
presents as  a  slow-healing ulcer
accompanied
by
lymphadenopathy.
Individuals
particularly at risk, such as hunters, trappers, veterinarians
and laboratory workers, should take precautions when
handling suspect animals or materials.
A modified live vaccine is available for personnel working
with F. tularensis in specialized laboratories.

Histophilus

 and
Avibacteriumparagallinarum
There have been a number of taxonomic changes to
organisms within the genus Haemophilus in recent years
The species Histophilus somni now includes the bovine
commensal and
l opportunistic
Cpathogen‘Haemophilus
somnus’ and the ovine organisms Histophilus ovis and
Haemophilus agni (Angen et al.,2003).Haemophilus
paragallinarum has been reclassified as Avibacterium
paragallinarum (Blackall et al., 2005). These species are
small (less than 1um x 1 to 3um), Gramenegative rods.
which often appear coccobacil-lary and may occasionally
form short filaments. These motile organisms, which are
facultative anaerobes with variable reactions in catalase
and oxidase tests, do not grow on MacConkey agar. They
are fastidious bacteria; H. parasuis and Avibacterium
paragallinarum require growthfactor V(nicotinamide
adenine dinu-cleotide, NAD). Optimal growth for all these
species occurs in an atmosphere of 5 to 10% CO2 on
  (  o ss   
factors although, in the case of H. somni, X and V factors
are not absolute requirements for growth. Most isolates of
these organisms form small, transparent, dewdrop-like
colonies after incubation for 48 hours. Colonies of H.
somni have a yellowish hue and some isolates are
haemolytic on sheep blood agar.
The diseases caused by H. somni, H. parasuis and A.
paragallinarum are summarized in Table 29.1.Other
841
Haemophilus and Avibacterium species, which are
commensals on the mucous membranes of animals, rarely
cause disease (Table 29.2). The soluble antigens of these
organisms exhibit heterogeneity. A total of 15 serotypes of
H. parasuis have been identified and serotyping is also
used
for characterization of  H.
somni
 and
TA.
paragallinarum strains.

· Isolation techniques:
Both X and V factors are required in media for isolation of
some Haemophilus and Avibacterium species. Although
Histophiius somni does not have an absolute requirement for
these factors, its growth is enhanced by their presence. The
X factor is heat stable and is present in red blood cells. The
heat-l abile V factor, which is also present in red blood cells,
is susceptible to NADases in plasma. There are two common
methods for ensuring the availability of both X and V factors
in culture media:
- Chocolate agar, which supplies both factors, is prepared
about 10 minutes. The chocolate-brown colour of the
medium is due to lysis of the red cells. The heat- stable X
factor, released from the lysed cells, is unaffected by this
procedure. The V factor, which is also released from the
lysed cells, tolerates a temperature of 8o?C for a short
period whereas the plasma NADases which degrade V
factor are destroyed.
- Staphylococcus aureus growing on blood agar releases V
factor into the medium. Colonies of Haemophilus species
which require V factor grow close to the S. aureus colony,
a phenomenon referred to as satellitism
· Tests for X and V factor requirements:
- The disc method for determining X and V factor
requirements is illustrated and explained in Fig. 29.1. This
test is particularly suitable for determining V factor
requirement. The porphyrin test is a more accurate method
844
for determining the growth requirement for X factor. The
isolate is grown at 37°C for 4 hours in broth containing a
porphyrin precursor. When the culture is exposed to UV
light in the dark, porphyrin production is detected by a red
  o   n   
requirement for the X factor.
·Biochemical reactions:
- Some biochemical tests (Table 29.3) canbe carried out
using conventional media. For testing
- Commercially available biochemical kits are used for
testing isolates in a wider range of tests (Palladino et al..
1990).
·Molecular tests:
- Although serotyping methods for characterization of all
three species are used, molecular-based methods are
employed with increasing frequency. Many of these are
fingerprinting methods but, as with serotyping, clear
associations between virulence attributes and particular
strains have not been established.

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Histophilus somni, H. parasuis and A. paragallinarum are
heterogeneous organisms and their virulence differs from
strain to strain. Some isolates are apparently purely
commensal in nature and are never isolated from
pathological specimens. For example, many isolates of H.
parasuis belonging to serotype 3 are found only in the
systemic sites (Oliveira et al., 2003). An avirulent bovine
preputial isolate of H. somni appeared to lack many
putative virulence factors  when compared  with
a
pathogenic isolate from a case of bovine pneumonia
(Sandal and Inzana, 2010). This variability between strains
846
can cause difficulties in diagnosis as isolation of the
organism from some sites may not necessarily prove its
involvement in the disease condition observed and further
characterization may be required to prove pathogenicity.
The natural habitat of all strains of Histophilus somni, H.
parasuis and A. para-gallinarum is the host animal and
disease   occurs  opportunistically  due  to   predisposing
factors. Young or previously
y unexposed animals  are
particularly
susceptible
to
infections.
Specific-pathogen-free pigs, which do not harbour H.
parasuis as a commensal, often develop signs of disease
on primary exposure to the pathogen. Environmental and
other stress factors such as transportation, weaning and
viral infections may contribute to the development of
infections by this group of organisms.
Histophilus somni can adhere firmly to several host cell
types, including endothelial and vaginal epithelial
cells although the exact mechanisms of adherence are not
clear. The organism has a number of virulence attributes,
which include endotoxin production, phase variation of its
lipo-oligosaccharide, induction of apoptosis in endothelial
cells
and
production
of
trans-ferrin
and
immunoglobulin-binding
proteins.
The
lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) of H.
.somni is a major
virulence factor, both because of its toxic lipid A
component and because the organism can modify the
structure of its LOS, resulting in phase variation and
evasion of the host immune response. Vasculitis is a major
feature of the lesions observed in H. somni infections and
LOS is involved in induction of apoptosis in endothelial
cells and in leukocytes (Czuprynski et al., 2004)
Immunoglobulin-binding proteins bind the Fc portion of
847
bovine IgG2 and are responsible for resistance to
complement-mediated killing in serum. In addition, H.
somni produces an exopolysaccharide and filamentous
haemagglutinin proteins, both of which may be involved in
biofilm formation (Sandal et al., 2009; Sandal and Inzana,
2010).
The virulence attributes of H. parasuis are poorly
characterized, and definitive proof of virulence requires
reproduction of disease in animals. Olvera et al. (2006)
suggest that H. parasuis strains may be classified into
three groups: avirulent isolates from the upper respiratory
tract, strains capable of producing bronchopneumonia and
strains that produce systemic disease. However, although
multilocussequence
 typing
 results   were partially
consistent with this grouping of strains, to date no typing
system capable of definitively identifying virulent strains
has been developed. It is known that H. parasuis produces
capsular polysaccharide, lipo-oligosaccharide and outer
membrane proteins but detailed information on their exact
pathogenic role is not available.
Much remains to be learned about the pathogenic
mechanisms of Avibacterium paragallinarum also. The
organism produces a capsule which is associated with
virulence    and 
s   o  q   
Haemagglutination inhibition is the basis of the Kume
serotyping scheme which divides the species into a number
of different serotypes.
Diagnostic procedures
848
· Specimens for laboratory examination depend on the clinical
condition and type of lesions. These bacterial species are
fragile and neither refrigeration nor transport media maintain
viability. Ideally, clinical specimens should be frozen in dry
       a  
collection.
· Either chocolate agar or blood agar inoculated with a streak
of S. aureus, incubated in 5 to 10% CO2 at 37°C for 2 to 3
days in a moist atmosphere, is used for isolation.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
- Small, dewdrop-like colonies after 1to2 days
- Enhancement of growth by CO2
- Requirement for X and V growth factors
-- Biochemical profile
      
epidemiological purposes, these tests are of little diagnostic
value because this group of organisms does not show a
consistent relationship between serotype and virulence.
·PCR-based tests have been developed for detection and
identification of these pathogens. Tegtmeier et al. (2000)
found that PCR-based methods for the detection of H. somni
were the most sensitive when compared with culture,
immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization techniques.
Haemophilus parasuis can be particularly difficult to isolate
and a specific PCR method for this organism developed by
Oliveira et al. (200l) may improve detection rates in clinical
specimens, especially if these are not of optimal quality or
diagnostic laboratories lack specific expertise in culturing
this pathogen (Turni and Blackall, 2007 ). Chen et al. (
1996) used PCR techniques for the identification of A.
paragallinarum and also developed a test for detection of the
organism in clinical specimens (Chen et af., 1998). Realtime
849
PCR for detection of A. paragallinarum was successfully
developed by Corney et al. (2008).
Clinical infections
Histophilusand
IHaemophilusspecieswhich
are
pathogenic for animals tend to be host-specific (Table

Haemophilus   species  of uncertain
pathogenicity  which  are occasionally
isolatedfrom
domestic animals are listed in Table 29.2.
Infections caused by Histophilus somni in cattle
Histophilus somni is part of the normal bacterial flora of
the male and female bovine genital tracts. The organism
can
also
colonize
　the
upper
 respiratory   tract.
Environmental stress factors contribute to the development
of clinical disease. Histophilus somni is more resistant in
the environment than many Haemophilus species. It can
 saep o oi dn sog pooq pue saleqosp [eseu ul aalans
ambient temperatures and for up to 5 days in vaginal
discharges. Transmission is by direct contact or by
aerosols. Serological surveys indicate that at least 25% of
cattle have antibodies to H. somni (Harris and Janzen,
1989).
Clinical signs
Because septicaemia is commonly associated with H.
somni infection, many organ systems may be involved and
the resulting clinical
presentation  is unpredictable
Thrombotic meningoencephalitis (TME), a common
consequence of septicaemia, is encountered sporadically in
young cattle recently introduced to feedlots. Some animals
850
may be found dead and others may present with high fever
and depression, sometimes accompanied by blindness,
lameness and ataxia. Sudden death due to myocarditis has
also been described. Arthritis often develops in animals
which survive the acute phase of the disease.
Histophilus somni is one of the bacterial pathogens
commonly isolated from the enzootic calf pneumonia
complex. Sporadic cases of abortion, endometritis, otitis
and mastitis caused by H. somni have been recorded.
Diagnosis
· Severe neurological signs in young feedlot cattle may be
indicative of TME.
· Multiple foci of haemorrhagic necrosis, detectable grossly in
affected brains at post-mortem, are consistent with TME.
Vasculitis, thrombosis and haemorrhage are evident
histologically in brain, heart and other parenchymatous
organs.
·Confirmation is by isolation and identification of H. somni
from cerebrospinal fluid, from lesions detected post mortem
or from aborted foetuses.
Treatment and control
·Animals with clinical signs of septicaemia should be isolated
and those at risk should be monitored closely to detect early
signs of the disease.
· Although oxytetracycline is usually used for therapy,
penicillin, erythromycin and potentiated sulphonamides are
also effective.
· Commercially available bacterins may reduce morbidity and
mortality rates but their efficacy is variable. The protective
antigens in these bacterins are not known and work is
        
851
developing improved vaccines in the future (Siddaramppa
and Inzana, 2004 ; Sandal and Inzana, 2010 ).
Infections caused by Histophilus somni in sheep
 n no  o ss ao A  daus 
prepuce or vagina. Epididymitis in young rams caused by
H. somni has been recorded (Lees et al., 1990). Vulvitis,
mastitis and reduced reproductive performance in ewes
have been attributed to infection with H. somni. The
organism has also been associated with septicaemia,
arthritis, meningitis and pneumonia in lambs.
Glasser's disease
Glasser's disease, caused by Haemophilus parasuis,
manifests  as  polyserositis  and   leptomeningitis  usually
affecting pigs from weaning up to 12 weeks of age. Some
cases present as polyarthritis.
Haemophilus parasuis is part of the normal flora of the
from sows shortly after birth either by direct contact or
through aerosols. The presence of matermally derived
antibodies prevents the development of clinical signs.
However, Glasser’ s disease may occur sporadically in 2-
to 4-week-old piglets subjected to stressful environmental
conditions (Smart et al., 1989). Active immunity to H.
parasuis is usually established by 7 to 8 weeks of age.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is 1 to 5 days. Clinical signs usually
developinconventionally reared pigs 2 to 7days
852
   s s s on s 
transportation. Anorexia, pyrexia, lameness, recumbency
and convulsions are features of the disease. Cyanosis and
thickening of the pinnae are often encountered. Pigs may
die suddenly without showing signs of illness.
Diagnosis
Because organisms such as Streptococcus suis and
similar to those of Glasser's disease, diagnosis requires
detection and identification of H. parasuis. Furthermore,
detection of the organism from areas such as the upper
respiratory tract or the lungs is not proof of involvement in
observed lesions as non-pathogenic isolates of the organism
can be found in these sites in normal pigs.
· Isolation and identification of H. parasuis from joint fluid,
heart blood, cerebrospinal fluid or postmortem tissues of a
recently dead pig are confirmatory.
·Post-mortem findings in Glasser's disease may include
fibrinous polyserositis, polyarthritis and meningitis.
Treatment and control
Antimicrobial drugs such as tetracyclines, penicillins or
potentiated sulphonamides, administered
early in the course of the disease, are usually effective.
Haemophilus parasuis isolates remain susceptible to most
drugs commonly used in pig production (Aarestrup et al.,
2004).
· Predisposing stress factors should be identified and, where
possible, eliminated.
· Commercially available bacterins or autogenous bacterins
may  stimulate protective immunity  which is serotype
specific.
Infectious coryza of chickens
853
Infectious coryza, caused by A. paragallinarum, affects the
upper respiratory tract and paranasal sinuses of chickens.
Its economic importance relates to loss of condition in
broilers and reduced egg production in laying birds.
Chronically ill and, occasionally, clinically normal carrier
birds act as reservoirs of infection. Transmission occurs by
direct contact, by aerosols or from contaminated drinking
water. Chickens become susceptible at about 4 weeks after
hatching and susceptibility increases with age.
Clinical signs
The mild form of disease manifests as depression, serous
nasal discharge and slight facial swelling.  In severe
disease, swelling of one or both infraorbital sinuses is
marked and oedema of the surrounding tissues may extend
to the wattles. In laying birds, egg production may be
severely affected.
A copious, tenacious exudate may be evident at
post-mortem  in  the  infraorbital  sinuses. Tracheitis,
bronchitis and airsacculitis may be present also.
Diagnosis
·Facial swelling is a characteristic finding.
·Isolation and identification of A. paragallinarum from the
infraorbital sinuses of several affected birds is confirmatory.
· Immunoperoxidase staining can be used to demonstrate A.
paragallinarum in the tissues of the nasal passages and
sinuses (Nakamura et al., 1993 ).
 Serological tests such as agglutination tests, ELISA or agar
gel immunodiffusion tests are used to demonstrate
854
antibodies about 2 to 3 weeks after infection and to confirm
the presence of A. paragallinarum in a flock.
Treatment and control
·Medication of water and feed with sulphonamides or
Oxytetracycline should be initiated early in an outbreak of
disease.
·An all-in/all-out management policy should be implemented
and replacement birds should be obtained from coryza-free
stock. Good management of poultry units minimizes the risk
of infection.
· Bacterins may be of value in units where the disease recurs.
Vaccines should be administered about 3 weeks before
Outbreaks of coryza are anticipated.

Taylorella species
Taylorella equigenitalis and the more recently described
Taylorella asinigenitalis (Jang et al., 200l) are the only
members of the genus. Taylorella species are short (0.7 x
0.7 to 1.8μm), non-motile, Gram-negative rods, which give
positive reactions in catalase, oxidase and phosphatase
tests. They are microaerophilic, slow-growing and highly
fastidious, requiring chocolate agar and 5 to 10% CO2 for
optimal growth. Although the bacteria are not dependent
on the X or V growth factors, availability of factor X
stimulates growth. Taylorella species do not grow on
MacConkey agar.
Usual habitat
The organism is found in the genital tracts of stallions.
mares and foals. In stallions, T. equigenitalis is harboured
  s  a  ss ln  
clitoral fossa of infected mares. T. asinigenitalis can be
isolated from the genital tract of donkeys.
Clinical infections
Taylorella equigenitalis, the cause of contagious equine
metritis, appears to infect only Equidae (Platt and Taylor.
1982). Taylorella asinigenitalis has not been associated
with clinical disease in donkeys.
Contagious equine metritis
860
Contagious equine metritis (CEM) was first reported as a
       
Ireland (Crowhurst, 1977: O'Driscoll et al., 1977)
Outbreaks of the disease were subsequently described in
other European countries and in the USA, Australia and
Japan. It is a highly contagious, localized, venereal disease
characterized  by  mucopurulent  vulval  discharge  and
temporary infertility  in  mares. The  condition is
economically  important because it disrupts breeding
programmes on thoroughbred stud farms.
Key points
- Short, non-motile Gram-negative rods
· Fastidious, optimal growth on chocolate agar
· Microaerophilic, S to 10% CO2 required
· Positive oxidase, catalase and phosphatase tests
but otherwise unreactive
- T. equigenitalis causes contagious equine metritis
Infected stallions and mares are the main reservoirs of
infection. Transmission of the bacterium usually occurs
during coitus although infection may also be introduced by
contaminated   instruments.   It
t is considered
1that
spontaneous ascending infection in mares is unlikely and
that T. equigenitalis must be deposited in the uterus for
infection to establish (Platt and Taylor, 1982). Foals born
p  o   n  s  
parturition. Taylorella equigenitalis has been isolated from
more than 75% of the offspring of infected mares at 2 to 4
years of age (Timoney and Powell, 1982). These offspring
861
and mares, which have recovered clinically, may act as
sources of infection.
Pathogenesis
Pre-ejaculatory fluid and semen may be contaminated with
T. equigenitalis from the urethral fossa. After introduction
into the uterus, pathogenic organisms replicate and induce
an acute endometritis. Initially, mononuclear cell and
plasma cell infiltration predominates, a feature rarely
observed in acute bacterial endometritis (Ricketts et al.,
1978). Later, migration of neutrophils into the uterine
lumen produces a profuse mucopurulent exudate. Although
the pathogen may persist in the uterus, acute endometrial
changes subside within a few days. There are few data
available on the virulence mechanisms of the organism
although its ability to invade equine cell lines has been
investigated (Bleumink-Pluym et al., 1996). There is
strong clinical and epidemiological evidence that strains
differ in pathogenicity (Parlevliet et al., 1997 ) but the
basis for the differences in pathogenicity is unknown.
Clinical signs
Infected stallions and a minority of infected mares remain
asymptomatic. Most affected mares develop a copious,
mucopurulent,  vulvaldischarge
withoutS
systemic
disturbance within a few days of service by a carrier
stallion. The discharge may continue for up to 2 weeks and
affected mares remain infertile for several weeks. Some
mares recover without treatment and up to 25% remain
carriers (Platt and Taylor, 1982). Infection does not induce
protective immunity and reinfection can occur.
862
Diagnostic procedures
The OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals (Anon., 2008) details the sample types
and diagnostic requirements for this notifiable disease
·A copious, mucopurulent, vulval discharge 2 to 7 days after
service may indicate the presence of CEM.
 Specimens for bacteriology should be collected before and
during the breeding season.
· Swabs from mares should be taken from the clitoral fossa
and sinuses and from the endometrium at oestrus using a
double-guarded swab. When taking swabs, disposable gloves
should be changed between each animal.
·Foals of infected mares should be sampled before 3 months
of age. Swabs should be taken from the clitoral fossa of
fillies and from the penile sheath and tip of the penis in colts.
Swabs from stallions and teaser stallions are taken from the
urethra, ure-thral fossa and penile sheath in addition to
pre-ejaculatory fluid.
· Swabs must be placed in Amies charcoal transport medium
and reach the laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
Samples should be submitted to laboratories which are
officially certified by a regulatory authority.
·Chocolate agar-based media with the
additionof
amphotericin B, crystal violet and streptomycin are suitable
for isolation of the organism. Plates with and without
streptomycin should be inoculated as some isolates of T.
equigenitalis are susceptible to this antibiotic. A medium
developed (Timoney et al., 1982). Inoculated plates are
incubated under 5 to 10% CO2 at 37°C for 4 to 7 days.
·Identification criteria forisolates:
- Colonies, which may be visible after 48 hours, are small.,
smooth and yellowish grey and have an entire edge.
863
-- Reactions in the catalase, oxidase and phos-phatase tests
are positive.
-A slide agglutination test, using high-titred T.
equigenitalis antiserum, can be carried out on the culture.
- A fluorescent antibody technique using conjugated
serum, rendered specific by absorption with Mannheimia
haemolytica, may be used.
- A latex agglutination kit to identify the pathogen is
available commercially.
· Polymerase chain reaction  techniques for detecting  T.
of authors (Bleumink-Pluym et af., 1993; Chanter et af.,
1998; Anzai et al., 1999; Moore et al., 2001; Duquesne et al,
2007). Wakeley et al. (2006) developed a real-time PCR
method which can be used directly on genital swabs and, in
addition, can differentiate between T. equigenitalis and T.
asinigenitalis.
·Several molecular methods for strain typing of T.
equigenitalis are available, most of them based on digestion
with restriction enzymes followed by pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (Matsuda and Moore, 2003 ).
· Serological tests including the agglutination, complement
fixation and ELISA tests are useful for confirming active or
recent infections but do not detect asymptomatic carriers.
Treatment
Asymptomatic carriers must be treated as well as clinically
affected animals. Elimination of T. equigenitalis
from both mares and stallions can usually be accomplished
by washing the external genitalia with a 2% solution of
chlorhexidine  combined  with  local application  of
864
antimicrobial drugs such as nitrofurazone ointment on a
daily basis (Watson, 1997). In addition, a daily intrauterine
irrigation with antibiotic solution is carried out in mares
for 5 to 7 days. Ablation of clitoral sinuses may be
necessary in those mares in which T. equigenitalis persists
after treatment.
Control
Contagious equine metritis is a notifiable disease in many
countries with an advanced thoroughbred industry.
· Control regimens are based on laboratory detection of
asymptomatic and clinical infections with T. equigenitalis in
animals used for breeding.
·Appropriate, routine, hygienic methods must be practised on
 stud farms to prevent lateral spread of the pathogen.
· If CEM is diagnosed on stud farms, all breeding services
should cease immediately.
        
pathogen.
Test-mating a stallion to two maiden mares is a sensitive
method for detecting infection. Samples from the mares are
then examined bacteriologically

Bordetella species
The genus Bordetella contains eight species, including
three which are pathogenic for animals, B. bronchiseptica,
B. avium and B. parapertussis. Bordetella pertussis, the
type species, is associated with whooping cough in
children. The major animal pathogens are Bordetella
bronchiseptica, which infects a wide range of animal
species including humans, and B. avium, which is a
pathogen of avian species (Table 31.1). Ovine strains of
Bordetella parapertussis are associated with pneumonia in
lambs while human strains of this species cause a mild
form of whooping cough. It is suggested that some strains
of B. hinzii may be capable of causing disease in turkeys
although
 this
organism
S
generallyregarded as
non-pathogenic
(Register
and
Kunkle,2009).The
bordetellae are occasional pathogens which have an
affinity for ciliated
1  respiratory  epithelium.  Bordetella
bronchiseptica and B. avium are small (0.2 to 0.5 x 0.5 to
1.5 μm), Gram-negative rods with a coc-cobacillary
appearance.
These
species
are
catalase-positive,
oxidase-positive aerobes and are motile peritrichous
bacteria, which grow on MacConkey agar. Because they
cannot utilize carbohydrates, they derive their energy
mainly from the oxidation of amino acids and have no
special growth requirements. Bordetella parapertussis is
non-motile and some strains grow on MacConkey agar.
Usual habitat
870
Bordetella species are commensals on the mucous
membranes of the upper respiratory tract and some species
may be pathogenic for animals. In the environment,
survival time is usually short although B. avium may
survive for prolonged periods in water (Raffel et al., 2002
)
Key points
- Small Gram-negative rods
· Growth on non-enriched media; major animal
pathogens grow on MacConkey agar
·Strict aerobes
· Motile, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive
- Utilize amino acids for energy
· Toxigenic strains agglutinate mammalian red
blood cells
· Commensals in upper respiratory tract; some
species are opportunistic pathogens
· Cause respiratory disease in mammals and birds
Differentiation of Bordetella bronchiseptica and B. avium
These
bacteria are usually
identifiedbygrowth
characteristics, by biochemical reactions and by their
unique ability to agglutinate red blood cells (Table 31.2).
Bordetella avium requires differentiation from Alcaligenes
faecalis, which is non-pathogenic
·On sheep blood agar, colonies of virulent strains, visible
after incubation for 24 hours, are small, convex and smooth.
Many isolates of B. bronchiseptica are haemolytic, unlike B.
avium, which is non-haemolytic.
871
· On MacConkey agar, both B. bronchiseptica and B. avium
 produce pale, non-lactose-fermenting colonies.
· A selective indicator medium containing bromoth-ymol blue
as pH indicator is used for the isolation and presumptive
identification of bordetellae (Smith and Baskerville, 1979).
Other selective media such as charcoal/cephalexin agar can
be used also (Egberink et af., 2009).
·Miniaturizedbiochemical

(Hozbor et al., 1999; Koidl et af., 2007).
·Typing methods have been developed for epi-demiological
and research purposes and include multilocus sequence

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
872
The bordetellae exhibit phase changes, which correlate
with virulence and are identifiable by colonial appearance.
Expression of virulence is regulated by a two-component
signal transduction system encoded by the BvgAS locus.
The avirulent phase occurs at 25°C whereas at 37°C
BvgAS activates the expression of many virulence genes.
Virulence is mediated by several factors, which can be
broadly classified as adhesins or toxins. Adhesins include a
filamentous haemagglutinin, pertactin and fimbriae which
allow attachment to the cilia of the upper respiratory tract
       
and
 tracheobronchial
clearance.
In  addition, 
B
bronchiseptica produces an adenylate cyclase-haemolysin
which enters host cells through a type 1 secretion system
This toxin primarily targets phago-cytic cells (Gueirard
and Guiso, 1993; Harvill et al., 1999) and has a unique
structure
1t
 has
the
features   of
repeats-in-structural-toxin but with an extra domain for an
adenylate cyclase enzyme (Table 31.3). Other toxins
include  dermonecrotic  toxin  which  produces  turbinate
atrophy in pigs by interfering with differentiation of
osteoblasts. A type II secretion system translocates
various effector proteins into host cells, inducing cell
death, and increased expression of this system appears to
correlate with increased virulence (Buboltz et al., 2009).
Bordetella avium lacks the adenylate cyclase toxin but the
organism  does  produce  a
haemagglutinin, which
specifically agglutinates guinea-pig red cells and correlates
with pathogenicity for turkey poults (Gentry-Weeks et al..
1988; Sebaihia et al., 2006).Pertussis toxin is produced
only by the human pathogen, B. pertussis.

Clearance of the bacteria is mediated by locally produced
antibodies (IgA) which appear about 4 days after infection
commences.Although these antibodies can block
attachment of bordetellae to cilia, they are unable to
remove attached bacteria. Clearance of bor-detellae from
the respiratory tract may require several weeks. Carrier
animals, including a percentage of adults which continue
to shed the organisms, represent an important source of
infection.
Diagnostic procedures
· Specimens for laboratory examination include nasal swabs,
tracheal aspirates and exudates.
·Bordetellae are cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar
or on selective media. Plates are incubated aerobically at
37°C for 24 to 48 hours.

multiplex assays.
Clinical infections
875
Clinical signs associated with bordetellae usually relate to
upper respiratory tract infection. Young animals are most
susceptible, and infections in adults are usually mild or
subclinical. Predisposing factors such as stress or
concurrent infections contribute to field outbreaks of
disease. Although morbidity rates may be high, mortality
rates are usually low. The diseases associated with B.
bronchiseptica and B. avium are summarized in Table
31.1. Bordetella parapertussis, a recognized human
pathogen, has been isolated from lambs with chronic
non-progressive pneumonia (Cullinane et al., 1987).

In  addition, B.

disease
e in pigs in association with other pathogens.
Oropharyngeal swabs from healthy cats may yield B.
bronchiseptica and severe bronchopneumonia associated
with the organism has been reported in kittens
(Willoughby et al., 1991). Bordetella bronchiseptica may
occasionally cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in
rabbits and in laboratory rodents. Bordetella avium causes
turkey coryza and respiratory disease in quails (Blackall
and Doheny, 1987).

Canine infectious tracheobronchitis
Canine infectious tracheobronchitis, also known as kennel
cough, is one of the most prevalent respiratory complexes
of dogs. Although Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine
parainfluenzavirus 2 (PI-2) and canine adenovirus 2 (CAV
2) are considered to be the most important aetiological
agents, other microbial pathogens may also be involved
(Box 31.1).
Transmission occurs through respiratory secretions either
by direct contact or by aerosols. Mechanical transfer on
footwear or clothing, on contaminated feeding utensils and
on fomites can spread infection in kennels, pet shops and
animal shelters. Although morbidity rates may reach 50%,
mortality rates are usually low. Organisms may remain in
the respiratory tract and be shed for several months after
clinical recovery.
Clinical signs
Clinical signs of infection with B. bronchiseptica develop
within 3 to 4 days of exposure and, without complications,
persist for up to 14 days. They include coughing, gagging
or retching and mild serous oculonasal discharge. Affected
dogs usually remain active, alert and non-febrile. The
disease  is   self-limiting  unless   complicated
1by
877
bronchopneumonia which may develop in unvaccinated
pups or in older immunosuppressed animals.
Diagnosis
· Diagnosis is based on a history of recent exposure to carrier
dogs and characteristic clinical signs.
· The appropriate specimen for laboratory examination is
 tracheal fluid collected by transtracheal aspiration.
·Virulent isolates of B. bronchiseptica haemagglutinate ovine
and bovine red cells.
· Serology, in association with vaccination history, may be of
value for determining the involvement of respiratory viruses.
Treatment
·Dogs with mild clinical signs do not require specific therapy.
·If coughing persists for more than 2 weeks or if
bronchopneumonia is present, antibiotic therapy may be
required. Amoxicillin has proved effective in field trials
(Thursfield et al., 1991). Emergence of resistance to
penicillin, the cephalosporins and sulphonamides has been
reported recently (Schwarz et al., 2007). Tetracyclines and
fluoroquinolones may be effective (Bemis, 1992 )
Control
·Affected dogs should be isolated immediately.
· If predisposing factors are identified, they should be
corrected.
· Intranasal vaccines containing B. bronchiseptica and P[-2
affected by maternal antibodies. Some vaccines contain
canine adenovirus type 2 also. Modified live B.
bronchiseptica vaccines decrease the severity of clinical
signs but may not prevent infection. Modified live vaccines
are available for many of the viruses associated with
respiratory disease in dogs.
878
Bordetella bronchiseptica and the development of atrophic
rhinitis
Toxigenic strains of B. bronchiseptica are widely
distributed in pig herds. They can cause turbinate
hypopla-sia without distortion of the snout in piglets under
4 weeks of age. In uncomplicated infections, pigs reach
slaughter age with relatively minor change in the tur-binate
bones (Rutter, 1989). However, the infection with B.
bronchiseptica may facilitate colonization by toxigenic
Pasteurella multocida type D with the subsequent
development of severe atrophic rhinitis and distortion of
the snout. Factors such as overstocking and poor
ventilation can contribute to the development of atrophic
rhinitis. The most severe form of the disease results from
concurrent infection with B.  bronchiseptica and P
multocida (Pedersen et al., 1988 ).
Turkey coryza
Turkey coryza, caused by B. avium, is a highly contagious
upper respiratory tract disease of poults, with high
morbidity and low mortality. Infection is spread
through direct contact, by aerosols and from environmental
sources. Mucus accumulates in the nares with swelling in
the submaxillary
/sinuses. Beak-breathing, excessive
lacrimation and sneezing may be evident. Infection with B.
avium predisposes to secondary infections with bacteria
such as Escherichia coli. Once E. coli becomes
established, a more serious disease with high mortality can
develop.
Diagnosis
879
· Clinical signs and gross pathological features may be
indicative of the disease.
·Isolation and identification of B. avium from sinus and
tracheal exudates is confirmatory.

diagnostic value.
Treatment and control
·Broad-spectrum antibiotics early in the course of disease
may be beneficial.
· Commercially available bacterins and modified live vaccines
may be used in susceptible flocks.
·- Thorough cleaning and disinfection of turkey houses after an
outbreak of disease are essential for the elimination of B.
avium.

Moraxella species
The genus Moraxella has been divided into two subgenera,
Moraxella and Branhamella.Moraxella species occur as
short (1.0 to 1.5 × 1.5 to 2.5 μm), plump, Gram-negative
rods or, occasionally, cocci which typically occur in pairs
(Fig. 32.1). Moraxellae are non-motile, aerobic and usually
catalase-positive and oxidase-positive. Most members of
the genus associated with disease are proteolytic but are
unable to utilize sugars. Growth, which is enhanced by the
addition of blood or serum to media, does not occur on
MacConkey agar.  Moraxella bovis  is  the principal
pathogen in the genus but M. bovoculi, M. ovis and M. equi
are also associated with disease in animals. Moraxelld
catarrhalis can cause disease in humans. Other species,
which are periodically isolated from clinical specimens,
are generally regarded  as non-pathogenic. Selected
Moraxella species which may be isolated from animals
and their clinical significance are presented in Table 32.1.
When  isolated
fromcasesofinfectiousbovine
keratoconjunctivitis, virulent strains of M. bovis are
fimbriate and haemolytic and grow into the agar.
Moraxella bovis
Moraxella bovis is found on mucous membranes of carrier
cattle. The organism is susceptible to desiccation and is
short-lived in the environment. It can survive for up to 72
hours in the salivary organs and on the body surfaces of
flies, which can act as vectors.

Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis
Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK), sometimes
referred to as ^pink-eye’ or New Forest disease, is a highly
contagious condition affecting the superficial structures of
the eyes, usually in animals under 2 years of age. The
disease causes economic losses arising from decreased
weight gain in beef breeds, loss of milk production,
short-term  disruption  of  breeding  programmes  and
treatment costs.

There appears to be an age-related immunity, probably as a

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
887
The virulence of M. bovis is attributed to fimbriae, which
allow adherence of the organisms to the cormea,
circumventing the protective effects of lacrimal secretions
and blinking. Two types of fimbriae are recognized,
namely Q fimbriae (pili), which are specific for
colonization, and I fimbriae, which allow local persistence
of infection (Ruehl et al., 1993). Fimbrial antigens
stimulate
  type-
specific
protective
immunity.
Filamentous-haemagglutinin-like  proteins
 may
be
important for adherence also (Kakuda et al., 2006).
During bacterial replication, haemolysin and other lytic
enzymes such as fibrolysin, phosphatase, hyaluronidase
and aminopeptidase are produced. Lipopolysaccharides,
associated with O antigens, also appear to play a role in
virulence (DeBower and
1Thompson,  1997). The
haemolysin  is  a  calcium-dependent,  pore-forming
cytolysin which damages
the cell  membranes of
neutrophils (Clinkenbeard and Thiessen, 1991). This toxin
was subsequently shown to be an RTX (repeats in toxin)
toxin withhaemolyticand
1cytotoxic activity and
designated Mbx A (Angelos et al., 200l). Release of
hydrolytic enzymes from neutrophils on the cormeal
surface contributes to breakdown of its collagen matrix
        
Isolates from carrier animals are often
non-haemolytic and non-fimbriate but reversion  to
virulence can occur. It has been suggested that the
deficiency of lysozyme in the lacrimal secretions of cattle
may account for their susceptibility to M. bovis (Punch and
Slatter, 1984).
888
Clinical signs
Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis initially manifests as
blepharospasm,
conjunctivitis
 and
lacrima-tion.
Progression of the condition through keratitis to corneal
ulceration, opacity and abscessation may occasionally lead
to panophthalmitis and permanent blindness (Punch and
Slatter, 1984). Following
ulceration,  vascularization
extends from the limbus and stromal oedema develops.
There may be weakening of the cormea with the
development of coning. In most mild cases, the cornea
heals within a few weeks although there may be permanent
scarring of the structure.
Some carrier animals may exhibit persistent lacrimation.
Following infection with a virulent strain of M. bovis.
neutralizing antibodies develop which are active against
antibodies that block fimbrial-mediated adherence are
type-specific and exposure to M. bovis possessing a
different fimbrial type may result in disease (Moore and
Rutter, 1989).
Diagnostic procedures
·The disease characteristically affects a number of animals in
a herd.
Lacrimal secretion is  the most suitable specimen for
laboratory examination. Because M. bovis is extremely
susceptible to desiccation, specimens must be processed
promptly. For transportation, swabs of lacrimal secretions
should be placed in 1 to 2 ml of sterile water. Ideally,
specimens should be cultured within 2 hours of collection.
889
·A fluorescent antibody technique for demonstrating M. bovis
in smears from lacrimal secretions is available.
·Specimens should be cultured on blood agar and
MacConkey agar and incubated aerobically at 37°C for 48 to
72 hours.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
- Round, small, shiny, friable colonies appear after 48
hours. Colonies of virulent strains are surrounded by a
     si   
agar.
- No growth occurs on MacConkey agar.
- Cultures of virulent strains autoagglutinate in saline
- Smears from colonies reveal short Gram-negative rods in
pairs (Fig. 32.1).
- Reactions in the catalase and oxidase tests are positive. A
Loeffler's serum slope may be pitted after 10 days.
· Differentiation of moraxellae isolated from the eyes of cattle
can be carried out using PCR-based methods (Angelos and
Ball, 2007).
· Fimbriate isolates can be assigned to seven serogroups
using molecular methods also, including randomly applied
polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis (Conceica0 et al., 2004)
and PCR-DNA fingerprinting (Prieto et al., 1999 ).
Treatment
Antimicrobial   therapy   should    be    administered
sub-conjunctivally or topically early  in the disease
(George, 1990; DeBower and Thompson, 1997).
890
Control
·Fimbriae-derived
bacterins, whichare　available
commercially in some countries, are of uncertain efficacy.
Vaccines incorporating both cytotoxin and fimbriae have
been developed and may provide enhanced protection
(Angelos et af., 2007a).
·Management-related methods are important in the control of
[BK. These include isolation of affected animals, reduction
of exposure to mechanical irritants, the use of insecticidal
ear tags and the control of concurrent diseases such as
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis or Thelazia infestation.
·The prophylactic use of intramuscular oxytetracycline can be
considered for animals at risk.
·Animals that are blind should be housed
·Vitamin A supplementation may be beneficial.

Brucella species
Brucella species are small (0.6 x 0.6 to 1.5 μm),
non-motile, coccobacillary, Gram-negative bacteria. As
they are not decolorized by 0.5% acetic acid in the
modified Ziehl-Neelsen (MZN) staining technique, they
are referred to as MZN-positive. In MZN-stained smears
of body fluids or tissues, they characteristically appear as
clusters of red coccobacilli (Fig. 33.1). As all species of
Brucella share a high degree of genetic similarity, there
was a proposal that all described species be classified
within the genus Brucella melitensis (Anon., 1988).
However, this decision was reversed in 2005 and the six
Brucella nomenspecies were re-approved (Osterman and
Moriyon, 2006). In addition, a number of new species,
including brucellae of sea mammals and voles, have been
characterized in recent years
(Table 33.1).Brucella
melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis are subdivided into
biovars based on cultural and serological properties. The
Brucella genome is unusual among veterinary pathogenic
bacteria as it is composed of two circular chromosomes,
with the exception of B. suis biovar 3, which has a single
chromosome. Brucella species are aerobic, capnophilic
and catalase-positive. Apart from B. ovis and B. neotomae,
they are oxidase-positive.
. All Brucella species are
urease-positive except B. ovis. Brucella ovis and some
biotypes of B. abortus require 5 to 10% CO2 for primary
isolation. Moreover, the growth of other Brucella species
is enhanced in an atmosphere of CO2. Media enriched with
894
blood or serum are required for culturing B. abortus
biotype 2 and B. ovis.
Usual habitat
As a general rule, brucellae have a predilection for both
female and male reproductive organs in sexually mature
animals and each Brucella species tends to infect a
particular  animal  species.  Infected  animals  serve  as
reservoirs of infection, which often persists indefinitely.
Organisms shed by infected animals can remain viable in a
moist   environment

months.  However,
transmission is usually through direct contact with infected
animals or fluids and tissues associated with abortion

agglutination with monospecific sera, susceptibility to
bacteriophages and molecular methods are employed for
definitive identification.
·On primary isolation, colonies of B. abortus, B. melitensis
and B. suis occur in smooth forms and are small, glistening,
bluish and translucent after incubation
for 3 to 5 days. Colonies become opaque with age. [n
contrast, primary isolates of B. ovis and B. canis always
occur in rough forms. These rough colonies are dull,
yellowish, opaque and friable. Brucellae are non-haemolytic
on blood agar.
· Slide agglutination tests with monospecific antisera are used
to detect the presence of important surface antigens, abortus
antigen A and melitensis antigen M. The R antigen, a feature
of the rough brucellae B. ovis and B. canis, can be detected
by anti-R serum.
· Isolates of B. abortus are lysed by a specific bacteri-ophage
(Tbilisi phage) at routine test dilution.
· If other tests give equivocal results, oxidative metabolic
rates on selective substrates can be conducted in reference
laboratories.
· PCR, PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism,
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis methods and other molecular
differentiation of Bruceffa isolates. One of the first PCR
methods developed was the AMOS-PCR (Bricker and
Halling, 1994), so named because it could differentiate
between B. abortus biovars, 1, 2 and 4, B. melitensis, B. ovis
and B. suis. This method has been refined over time and can
now differentiate other biovars and species in addition to B.
abortus vaccine strains. A new multiplex PCR assay
(Bruce-ladder) described in the OIE Terrestrial Manual
(Anon., 2009a) identifies most Brucella species in a single
step, including the newly described species from marine
mammals and B. abortus and B. melitensis vaccine strains.

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
The establishment
 and
outcome of infectionwith
bru-cellae depend on the number of infecting organisms
and their virulence and also on host susceptibility,
including age of the host (Price et al., 1990 ). Brucellae
which lack the major outer-membrane lipopolysac-charide,
produce rough colonies and are less virulent than those
derived from smooth colonies (Roop et al., 1991).
Although smooth and rough organisms can enter host cells,
rough forms are usually eliminated unlike smooth forms
which may persist and multiply. Brucellae persist within
macrophages but not within neutrophils. Non-opsonized
brucellae are taken up through interaction of the O
side-chains of LPS with cholesterol-rich regions of the
897
phagocyte plasma membrane, termed lipid rafts. Once
engulfed, brucel-lae
persist
within
the
acidified
phagosome,
or
Brucella-containing
vacuole'.
Acidification of the phagosome is important as it induces
changes in gene expression of the brucella organism,
which
favour
intracellular
survival.
Cyclic
beta-1 ,2-glucans, constituents of the outer membrane, help
in the prevention of phagolysosome fusion. Inhibition of
phagosome-lysosome function is a major mechanism for
intracellular survival and an important determinant of
bacterial virulence. While survival within the phagosome
occurs, replication of brucellae only takes place once the
"brucellosome’ is formed. This structure is formed through
the fusion of the Brucella-containing vacuole with the
rough endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell. Effectors
secreted by a type IV secretion system encoded by the virB
operon appear to be important in maturation of the vacuole
and in its transport to, and fusion with, the rough
endoplasmic reticulum (Celli et al., 2006; Carvalho Neta et
αl., 2010). In the next phase of infection, virulent brucellae
bacteraemia results in  spread and localization  in the
reproductive organs and associated glands in sexually
mature animals. Erythritol, a polyhydric alcohol which acts
as a growth factor for brucellae, is present in high
concentrations in the placentae of cattle, sheep, goats and
pigs. This growth factor is also found in other organs such
as the mammary gland and epididymis, which are targets
for brucellae. Intracellular replication in trophoblastic cells
is strongly influenced by the stage of gestation and
increases in late gestation, when the cells actively secrete
steroid hormones. In chronic brucellosis, organisms may
localize in joints or intervertebral discs. It is suggested that
898
brucellae may inhibit or delay the host immune response
and this may be responsible in part for the persistent
infections seen with this pathogen (Carvalho Neta et al.,
2010).

for up to 5 days. Although CO2 is a specific requirement for
individual species, the majority of brucellae are capnophilic.
 Serological testing is used for international trade and for
identifying infected herds or flocks and individual animals in
national eradication schemes (Table 33.3). Brucellae share
antigens with some other Gram-negative bacteria such as
Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:9 (Hilbink et al., 1995),
and consequently cross-reactions can occur in agglutination
tests.

Clinical infections
901
Although each Brucella species has its own natural host, B.
abortus, B. melitensis and biotypes of B. suis can infect
animals other than their preferred hosts (Table 33.1).
Bovine brucellosis
Bovine brucellosis, caused by B. abortus and formerly
worldwide in distribution, has been eradicated or reduced
to a low prevalence in many countries through national
eradication programmes. In some countries, including the
USA, wildlife species appear to have acquired infection
from domestic cattle and infection has become established
in wildlife. Endemic infection of wildlife such as bison and
elk makes eradication of brucellosis in cattle extremely
difficult in some parts of North America. Although
tissues and fluids, infection can occasionally follow
venereal contact, penetration through skin abrasions,
inhalation or transplacental transmission (Fig. 33.2). The
number of organisms shed in foetal fluids post abortion
dose is estimated to be approximately 10* organisms, large
numbers of animals may be infected by an aborting cow
especially when animals are in close contact indoors.
Abortion storms may be encountered in herds with a high
percentage of susceptible pregnant cows. Abortion usually
nsqn p o po   a  so
pregnancies are usually carried to term. Large numbers of
brucellae are excreted in uterine discharges for about 2 to 4
weeksfollowing
ganabortionandatsubsequent
parturitions, although infected calves appear normal.
Infection in calves is of limited duration in contrast to
cows in which infection of the mammary glands and
902
associated lymph nodes persists for many years. Brucellae
may be excreted intermittently in milk for a number of
years. In bulls, the structures targeted include seminal
vesicles, ampullae, testicles and epididymides. In tropical
countries, hygromas involving the limb joints are often
observed when the disease is endemic in a herd.
In affected herds, brucellosis can result in decreased
fertility, reduced milk production, abortions in susceptible
replacement animals and testicular degeneration in bulls.
Abortion is a consequence of placentitis involving both
cotyledons and intercotyledonary tissues. In the bull.
necrotizing  orchitis  occasionally  results  in  localized
fibrotic lesions.
Diagnosis
·  Clinical signs are not specific although abortions in first-calf
heifers and replacement animals may suggest the presence of
the disease.
· Clusters of MZN-positive coccobacilli may be evident in
smears of cotyledons, and MZN-positive organisms may
also be detected in foetal abomasal contents and uterine
discharges.
·Isolation and identification of B. abortus is confirmatory.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
- Colonial appearance
 MZN-positive organisms
- Bacterial cell agglutination with a high-titred antiserum
- Rapid urease activity
903
 Biotyping using tests and other features indicated in
Table 33.2
·A range of serological tests, varying in sensitivity and
specificity, is available for the identification of infected
animals (Table 33.3)
Brucellin, an extract of B. abortus, has been used for
intradermal testing (Worthington et al., 1993).
 Molecular methods, including PCR-based techniques for the
detection of brucellae in tissues and fluids, have been
developed.

Treatment and control
904
·Treatment of cattle with brucellosis is ineffective.
· National eradication schemes are based on the detection and
slaughter of infected cattle. Detection is usually based on
serological methods (Table 33.3).
· Vaccination of young heifers, a strategic measure during the
early years of eradication schemes, is discontinued when the
prevalence of brucellosis reaches low levels. Immunity in
brucellosis is
predominantly cell-mediated. Two vaccines are currently
used in cattle, attenuated strain 19 (S19) vaccine, and the
more recent RB51 vaccine:
- S19 vaccine is administered to female calves up to 5
months of age. Vaccination of mature animals leads to
persistent antibody titres.
- RB5l strain is a stable, rough mutant which induces
good protection against abortion and does not result in
serologicalresponses detectable in tests used in
conventional brucellosis surveillance programmes. It is
now the official vaccine for the prevention of brucellosis in
several countries.
- An adjuvanted 45/20 bacterin, although less effective,
has been used in some national eradication schemes in the
past. Even when administered to adult animals, this
vaccine did not induce persistent antibody titres.
- More specific information relating to mechanisms of
protective immunity against B. abortus would promote the
development of more effective vaccines.
Caprine and ovine brucellosis
905
Caprine and ovine brucellosis, caused by B. melitensis, is
most commonly encountered in countries around the
Mediterranean littoral and in the Middle East, central Asia
and parts of South America. Goats, in which the disease is
more severe and protracted, tend to be more susceptible to
infection than sheep. The clinical disease resembles
brucellosis in cattle in many respects. Clinical features
include high abortion rates in susceptible populations,
orchitis in male animals, arthritis and hygromas. Infection
resulting in abortion may not induce a protective
immunity.
Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, direct examination of
MZN-stained smears of fluids or tissues, isolation and
identification of B. melitensis and serologicaltesting
Intradermal brucellin tests are used for surveillance of
unvaccinated flocks and herds. In countries where the
disease is exotic, a test and slaughter policy is usually
implemented. Test and slaughter policies can also reduce
the
eprevalence of disease
einendemicareas
The
Rose-Bengal agglutination test and the complement
fixation test are the most widely used methods for
detecting infection with B. melitensis and are approved for
the purposes of international trade. Indirect enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays have been developed and are also
approved tests for the purposes of international trade
(Anon., 2009b). The modified live B. melitensis Rev. 1
strain, administered by the subcutaneous or conjunctival
routes, is used for vaccination of kids and lambs up to 6
months of age.
Ovine epididymitis caused by B. ovis
906
Brucella ovis produces an infection in sheep which is
characterized by epididymitis in rams and placentitis in
ewes. The infection was first recorded in New Zealand and
Australia  and  is   now    established
1 inmany other
sheep-rearing regions, including some European countries.
The consequences of infection include reduced fertility in
rams, sporadic abortion in ewes and increased perinatal
mortality. Both ram-to-ram and ram-to-ewe venereal
transmission occurs. Few of the ewes served by an infected
ram develop disease. There is a relatively long latent
period in rams following infection. Brucella ovis may be
present in semen about 5 weeks after infection and
epididymal lesions can be detected by palpation at about 9
weeks. In countries where the disease is endemic,
premating checks on rams include serological testing and
scrotal palpation. Chronically affected rams often have
unilateral or bilateral testicular atrophy with swelling and
hardening of the epididymis. The most efficient and widely
used serological tests for B. ovis are the agar gel
immunodiffusion test, the complement fixation test and the
indirect ELISA. An immunoblotting technique can also be
used as a confirmatory diagnostic test (Kittelberger et al.,
1997). Brucella ovis can be isolated from semen and a
species-specific PCR test for detection of B. ovis in a range
of clinical samples including semen, preputial washes and
urine has been developed (Xavier et al., 2010). A
multiplex PCR that will identify all three major causes of
epididymitis in rams,Actinobacillus seminis,Histophilus
somni and B. ovis, has been described (Saunders et al.,
2007). Young rams may be vaccinated with the B.
melitensis Rev. 1 vaccine or with B. ovis bacterin.
Porcine brucellosis
907
Porcine brucellosis, caused by B. suis, occurs occasionally
in the USA but is more prevalent in Latin America and
Asia. There is a prolonged bacteraemia and the disease is
manifest as chronic
inflammatory  lesions
in the
reproductive organs of sows and boars. Lesions may also
be found in bones and joints. Infection is acquired by
ingestion or by coitus and may be self-limiting in some
animals. Clinical signs in sows include abortion, stillbirths.
neonatal mortality and temporary sterility. Boars excreting
brucellae in semen may either be clinically normal or
present with testicular abnormalities. Associated sterility
may be temporary or permanent. Lameness, incoordination

involvement. Biovars 1 to 3 of B. suis infect pigs; biovar 2
differs from the other biovars in its host
range and in the lesions produced. It occurs in wild boar
throughout continental Europe and the European hare is
considered a reservoir host also. Wild boars have been
implicated as the source of biovar 2 infections in domestic
pigs reared outdoors. This biovar produces miliary lesions,
particularly in the reproductive tract.
The Rose-Bengal plate agglutination test and the indirect
ELISA are the most reliable serological methods for the
diagnosis of porcine brucellosis. A test and slaughter
policy is the main control measure in countries where the
disease is exotic. A modified live B. suis vaccine is used
for the vaccination of pigs in south China. Brucella suis
biovar 4 infects reindeer and caribou in Northern Canada.
Alaska and Siberia and biovar 5 infects wild rodents.
Canine brucellosis
908
Canine brucellosis, caused by B. canis, has been recorded
in the USA, Japan and Central and South America.
However, the distribution of the disease may be more
extensive than currently recognized because of difficulties
with diagnosis. As Brucella canis is permanently in the
rough form, it is of comparatively low virulence causing
relatively mild and asymptomatic infections. In breeding
establishmentsinfection
1 may manifest   clinically
as
abortions, decreased fertility, reduced litter sizes and
neonatal mortality. Most bitches that have aborted
subsequently have normal gestations. In male dogs the
main clinical feature of the disease is infertility often
associated with orchitis and epididymitis. Infertility may
be permanent and dogs with chronic infections are often
aspermic. Rarely, discospondylitis may result in lameness,
paresis   or 
 paralysis,
 and
uveitis.Generalized
lymphadenitis has been reported also. A rapid slide
agglutination test kit containing 2-mercaptoethanol is used
as a screening test but lacks specificity. Confirmatory tests
include a tube agglutination test, ELISA and an agar gel
immunodiffusion  test.  PCR-based
I tests  have  been
developed for detection of B. canis in blood and tissues
and appear to be as sensitive as cultural techniques.
Treatment, which should be confined to animals not
   sss     s
course of the disease. A combination of a tetracycline and
an aminoglycoside may be effective (Nicoletti and Chase.
1987) but long-term resolution is difficult to achieve
(Pretzer, 2008). Neutering infected animals reduces the
risk of transmission. A commercial vaccine is not available
and control is based on routine serological testing and
removal of infected animals from breeding programmes.
909
Brucellosis inhumans
Humans are susceptible to infection with B. abortus, B.
suis, B. melitensis and, rarely, with B. canis and the
brucellae of sea mammals. Transmission to humans occurs
through contact with secretions or excretions of infected
animals. Routes of entry include skin abrasions, inhalation
and ingestion. Raw milk and dairy produce made with
unpasteurized milk are important sources of infection.
Laboratory accidents account for some human infections.
Brucellosis in humans, known as undulant fever, presents
as fluctuating pyrexia, malaise, fatigue and muscle and
joint pains. Abortion is not a feature of human infection.
Osteomyelitis is the most common complication. Severe
infections occur with B. melitensis (Malta fever) and B.
suis biovars 1 and 2. Human infections due to B. abortus
are moderately severe whereas those caused by B. canis
are usually mild. Antimicrobial  therapy should be
administered early in an infection. Humans can develop a
severe hypersensitivity reaction  following  infection or
after accidental  inoculation  with attenuated  vaccinal
strains.

Campylobacter and Helicobacter species
Campylobacter species are slender, curved, motile,
Gram-negative rods (0.2 to 0.5 °m wide) with polar
flagella. Daughter cells which remain joined have a
characteristic gull-winged appearance, and long spirals
formed by joined cells also occur (Fig. 34.1). These
microaerophilic organisms grow best on enriched media in
an atmosphere of increased CO2 and decreased oxygen
tension.
.Many
Campylobacter speciesgrow
on
MacConkey agar.
They
 are  non-fermentative
and
oxidase-positive and have variable catalase reactions.
Campylobacter species are found in the intestinal and
genital  tracts  of
fdomestic
C animals  and  are  widely
distributed
geographically.The
 principal
 disease
conditions associated with infection are either intestinal,
presenting as diarrhoea, or genital, causing infertility or
abortion. Campylobacter species
were previously
classified in the genus Vibrio, and the term ^vibriosis' has
been retained for some of the disease conditions which
they cause. Three species, namely C. fetus subsp
venerealis,C. fetus subsp. fetus and C. jejuni subsp.jejuni
(hereafter referred to as C. jejuni), are recognized
pathogens of veterinary importance (Fig. 34.2).

A number of other species, some of which have been

domestic animals and from humans (Table 34.1). The
pathogenicity of these species has not been clearly
determined.
The
 genus
Helicobacter
belongs
totheorder
Campylobacterales and the species H. pylori is an
established human pathogen. There are more than 30
species in the genus described to date, many of which have
been isolated from animals, sometimes in association with
disease. In addition, these organisms may have zoonotic
potential.
Campylobacter species
Usual habitat
Many Campylobacter species are commensals in the
intestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals. Campylobacter
jejuni and C. lari colonize the intestines of birds, which
can result in faecal contamination of water-courses and
stored food.A number of Campylobacter species are
915
excreted in the faeces of pigs. Campylobacter fetus
subspecies venerealis appears to be adapted principally to
bovine preputial mucosa.

requiring an atmosphere of 5 to 10% oxygen and 1 to 10%
CO2 for growth. A selective enriched medium such as
Skirrow agar is usually used for primary isolation (Terzolo
et al, 1991). Differentiation of isolates is based on colonial
morphology    and
1certain cultural, biochemical and
antibiotic-susceptibility  characteristics.   In  addition  to
traditional phenotyping methods, molecular techniques are
increasingly used for differentiation.
· Colonial morphology:
916
- Campylobacter fetus subspecies venerealis and C. fetus
subspecies fetus have small, round, smooth, translucent
colonies with a dewdrop appearance.
- Campylobacter jejuni produces small, flat, grey colonies
with a spreading, watery appearance.
- Colonies of some Campylobacter species, which may
contaminate clinical specimens, can be slightly pigmented.

and quantitative real-time PCR procedures. Chaban et af.
(2009) report the development of real-time PCR assays for
the detection of as many as 14 different Campylobacter
species in dogs. Differentiation of the subspecies of
Campylobacter fetus can be difficult and PCR may be a
valuable technique for confirmation of phenotypic results
(Schulze et al., 2006). PCR procedures developed in one
geographical region may not detect clones of C. fetus from
· Molecular typing methodologies are widely used for
investigation of disease caused by Campylobacter species in
humans (Foley et al., 2009) and to a lesser extent in animals
(Sahin et al., 2008). Techniques employing pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) are frequently used. Campyiobacter
species are included in the PulseNet International system
whereby PFGE patterns of isolates from outbreaks of
foodborne illnesses are transmitted around the world,
enabling rapid comparison of isolates and investigation of
infection sources. Other methods which have been applied to
Campylobacter species include restriction fragment length

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis and C. fetus subsp.
fetus are structurally unusual in that they possess a
microcapsule
or
layer,which
consists of
high-molecular-weight  proteins arranged in  a  lattice
formation.  This  S
layerconfers resistance to
serum-mediated destruction and phagocytosis (Blaser and
Pei, 1993) and enhances survival in the genital tract. In
addition, because eight different antigenic variants of the
protein can be expressed by the organism, the immune
response of the host may be subverted (Grogono-Thomas
et al., 2003).
Much
  recent
research
 on  the pathogenicity 
of
Campylobacter species  has  concentrated  on  genomic
analysis for the identification of putative virulence genes.
A major outer membrane protein found in C. jejuni and C.
fetus subsp. fetus and subsp. venerealis acts as an adhesin.
 s  s is  s 
(Campylobacter  adhesion   to fibronectin) have been
identified also. Flagellar genes have been identified in
many species. Highly virulent species contain a wide
repertoire of virulence genes. (Fouts et al., 2005;
Moolhuijzen et al., 2009). The intestinal pathogen C.
920
jejuni  is internalized  into epithelial  cells following
adhesion and may replicate within the membrane-bound
compartment. It is then released by exocytosis from the
basolateral surface. Genes encoding cytolethal distending
toxin have been identified in C. jejuni and C. fetus, and the
pathogenic role of this toxin has been confirmed in C.

been shown to contain a unique genomic island which

The role of heat- stable endotoxin in the pathogenesis of
campylobacteriosis is uncertain.
Diagnostic procedures
Details of the diagnostic methods for individual clinical
conditions are presented in relevant sections.
·Irrespective of the source of specimens for bacterial
isolation, certain general principles relating to culture
techniques
apply.
Campylobacter
species
 require
microaerophilic conditions for growth, usually supplied by
6% oxygen, 10% carbon dioxide and 84% nitrogen.
Although most pathogenic species grow optimally at 37°C,
C. jejuni requires up to 5 days at 42°C for optimum growth.
Smears from cultures and from clinical specimens should be
stained with dilute carbol fuchsin (DCF) for 4 minutes. This
method stains the organisms more intensely than the Gram
method.

Clinical infections
The most important consequences of infections with
organisms in this group are infertility in cattle due to C.
fetus subsp. venerealis, and abortion in ewes caused either
by C. fetus subsp. fetus or by C. jejuni (Fig. 34.2).
Bovine genital campylobacteriosis
Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis, the principal cause
of bovine genital campylobacteriosis, is transmitted during
coitus to susceptible cows by
asymptomatic carrier bulls. The bacteria survive in the
glandular crypts of the prepuce and bulls may remain
temporary infertility associated with early embryonic
death, return to oestrus at irregular periods (Fig. 34.3) and,
occasionally, by sporadic abortion. About one-third of
infected cows become carriers. Campylobacter fetus subsp
venerealis persists in the vagina of carrier cows, a feature
922
attributed to antigenic shifts in the immunodominant
antigens of the S layer proteins. Extension of infection to
the uterus with the development of endometritis and
salpingitis can occur during the progestational phase of the
oestrous cycle when both the numbers and the activity of
neutrophils decline. The infertile period following uterine
invasion can last for 3 to 5 months, after which natural
immunity may  develop.  IgA  antibodies,  which
predominate in the vagina, limit spread of the infection.
IgG antibodies produced in the uterus opsonize the
pathogens, facilitating phagocytosis by neutrophils and
mononuclear cells (Fig. 34.3). This natural immunity may
last for up to 4 years.
Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus, an enteric organism
acquired by ingestion, can cause sporadic abortions in
cOwS.
Diagnosis
· Investigation of the breeding records and vaccination history
of an affected herd may suggest campylobacteriosis.
 Campylobacter species can be detected by the fluorescent
antibody technique in sheath washings from bulls or
cervicovaginal mucus from cows.
· Isolation and identification of Cfetus subsp. venerealis from
preputial or vaginal mucus is confirmatory. Specimens of
mucus should be placed in special transport medium
(Lander, 1990). A more recently developed transport
medium was described by Harwood et al. (2009) which
increased isolation rates and was more suitable
for
PCR-based detection than other transport media tested.
·Vaginal mucus agglutination test detects about 50% of
infected, infertile cows on a herd basis.

·An ELISA can be used to demonstrate IgA antibodies in
vaginal mucus after an abortion (Hum et af., 1991 ).

Recovery of fertility
Treatment and control
Dihydrostreptomycin, administered either systemically or
topically into the prepuce, is used for treating bulls.
 Intrauterine administration of dihydrostreptomy-cin can be
used therapeutically but does not eliminate the organism
from the vagina and cervix.
925
·Vaccination with bacterins in an oil emulsion adjuvant is
used therapeutically and prophylactically in problem herds.
Vaccines are not available worldwide.
Ovine genital campylobacteriosis
Campylobacteriosis in ewes may be caused by either C.
fetus subsp.fetus or C. jejuni. The disease is worldwide in
distribution and is one of the most common causes of
ovine abortion in some countries (Agerholm et al., 2006;
Mannering et al., 2006). Campylobacterfetus subsp. fetus
is found in the faeces of cattle and sheep and C. jejuni may
be present in the faeces of a wide range of birds and
mammals. Previously, C. fetus subsp. fetus was the most
common Campylobacter species associated with ovine
abortion but C. jejuni is becoming increasingly prevalent
in many countries. Sahin et al. (2008) reported the
emergence of a single tetracycline-resistant clone of C.
jejuni associated with abortion, which now appears to be
widespread in the United States. Transmission of both of
these organisms is by the faecal-oral route. During
pregnancy, localization in the uterus of susceptible ewes
may occur following bacteraemia. The subsequent necrotic
placentitis may result in abortion late in pregnancy or in
stillborm or weak lambs. Round, necrotic lesions up to 2
cm in diameter with pale raised rims and dark depressed
centres are evident on the liver surface in some aborted
lambs. Aborting ewes are major sources of infection for
susceptible animals in a flock. Up to 2o% of ewes in a
susceptible flock may abort. Recovered ewes are immune
for at least 3 years and flock fertility in subsequent
breeding seasons is usually good. Although no effect on
male fertility attributable to C.fetus has been reported,
recently Zan Bar et al.( 2008) demonstrated decreased
926
ram sperm quality and viability when incubated with C.
fetus in vitro.
Diagnosis
 Typical hepatic lesions in aborted lambs are pathognomonic
although such lesions are only occasionally observed.
·A presumptive diagnosis is made by demonstrating the
 Organisms in foetal abomasal contents or birth fluids.
·Isolation andidentification of C.fetus subsp.fetus Or C.
jejuni are confirmatory.
These pathogens should be differentiated from other causes
of abortion in ewes (see Chapter 86 ).
Treatment and control
Aborting ewes should be isolated and placentae and aborted
foetuses promptly removed. The remainder of the flock
should be moved to clean pasture.
After confirmation of the disease in a flock, vaccination of
ewes with a C. fetus subsp- fetus bacterin is reported to
reduce the number of abortions (Gumbrell et al., 1996 ).
·Routine vaccination of ewes with a bacterin is usually
carried out immediately before or after mating, with a
booster after the second month of gestation and annually
thereafter. There is no cross-protection between C. fetus
subspecies fetus and C. jejuni. In addition, variation between
strains

·Chlortetracycline administered daily in feed has been used to
control outbreaks of abortion. Because of the emergence of
tetracycline-resistant clones of Campylobacter as reported
by Sahin et af. (2008), the resistance pattern of the
responsible organism should be determined to assist in the
Intestinal campylobacteriosis in dogs
927
Diarrhoea in dogs and other domestic animals has been
attributed  to infection with Campylobacter  species
although confirmation is difficult because healthy animals
may shed Campylobacter species in their faeces. However,
the presence of large numbers of campylobacter- like
organisms in DCF-stained faecal smears or rectal scrapings
from dogs with diarrhoea may be indicative of infection. A
limitation of direct examination is the inability to
differentiate Campylobacter from other organisms with a
similar
 appearance
such
as
Helicobacter
or
Anaerospirillium species. A recent study using PCR-based
techniques to detect and quantify Campylobacter species
in the faeces of dogs found that 58% of healthy dogs and
97% of diarrhoeic dogs shed Campylobacter in faeces. A
greater variety of species was detected infaeces of
diarrhoeic dogs than in normal dogs (Chaban et al., 2010 ).
Campylobacter species may contribute to the severity of
enteric disease in
 dogsi
infected with  other
enter-opathogens such as enteric viruses, Giardia species
and helminths. Young, debilitated or immunosup-pressed
animals are particularly at risk. Enrofloxacin is usually
effective in eliminating faecal shedding of Campylobacter
species. Because of the development of resistance to the
quinolones in Campylobacter species, this class of drug
should be reserved for the treatment of campylobacteriosis
in humans. Accordingly, erythromycin is the preferred
drug for treatment of dogs infected with Campylobacter
species. As infection in dogs is usually self-limiting
treatment is not generally required except when there is a
risk of zoonotic transmission.
Avian vibrionic hepatitis
928
Birds commonly harbour C. jejuni in their intestinal tracts
and shed the organisms in their faeces. Chicks acquire
p         
introduced into contaminated premises. Infection  in
chickens and turkeys is usually asymptomatic and its
principal importance is as a source of infection for humans
following carcass contamination at slaughter. Outbreaks of
disease, which are uncommon, are characterized by a
substantial drop in egg production in the flock. Severely
affected birds are listless and lose condition. There may be
haemorrhage and multifocal necrosis in the liver. A

rods with darting motility in bile, using phase contrast
microscopy.  Dihydrostreptomycin  sulphate  should  be
administered in the food early in an outbreak of disease.
Vibrionic hepatitis has been described in ostriches in
association with C. jejuni and C. coli infection (Stephens et
al., 1998).
Intestinal campylobacteriosis in humans
Campylobacter jejuni is the main cause of human
intestinal campylobacteriosis, and campylobacter infection
is the most frequent cause of food poisoning in many
countries. Campylobacter coli and C. lari are sometimes
implicated.
.These
zoonotic infections  are  usually
food-borne although infection by direct contact with
animals such as dogs is now thought to be of importance
Poultry meat is a major source of human infection. Fever,
abdominal pain and diarrhoea, sometimes with blood, are
the most common manifestations of this enteric infection.
In addition, antimicrobial resistance in campylobacters,
929
particularly to fluoroquinolones, is a major public health
concerm.
Helicobacter species
These organisms are helical, S-shaped or curved.
Gram-negative rods (3.0 x 0.5 to 0.9 μm). They are related
to Campylobacter species  and Arcobacter species
Helicobacter species require enriched media; some grow
on
Skirrow's
agar.
They
aremicroaerophilic
non-saccharolytic, oxidase-positive and, with the exception
of H. canis, catalase-positive. Some helico-bacters are
found in the gastric mucosa and others are found in the
intestine of humans and animals, including both domestic
and wild animals and birds. A strong urease reaction is
characteristic of the helico-bacters which colonize the
gastric mucosa. The morphology of H. pylori, the human
pathogen  associated
with
gastric
 ulcers,  gastric
adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
(MALT) lymphoma,
l, is slightly curved. Non-H. pylori
helicobacters
are
long
and
spiral-shaped.  Many
helicobacter organisms which are found in animals are
difficult to culture. and detection and identification
frequently rely on molecular methods. Their role in
production of disease in animals is uncertain but they
appear to be associated with gastritis in some species such
as the pig, cat and dog (Haesebrouck et al., 2009). In
addition, the organism known as ‘Flexispira rappini',
associated with abortion in sheep, is now thought to
comprise several Helicobacter species (Dewhirst et al.,
2000). The morphology of these organisms is distinctive as
they are spindle-shaped Gram-negative bacteria with spiral
930
periplasmic fibres and bipolar tufts of sheathed flagella
Aborted lambs have multifocal hepatic necrosis
resembling the hepatic lesions caused by Campylobacter
species.
The principal importance  of  Helicobacter  species  in
animals may be as a source of infection for humans.
Contact with cats, dogs, cattle and pigs has been associated
with infection in humans by non-H. pylori helicobacters
(Harbour and Sutton, 2008).

Lawsonia intracellularis
This slender, curved, Gram-negative rod, Lawsonia
intracellularis, has not been grown in cell-ree media. Its
morphology is campylobacter-like and it was formerly
referred to as ^ileal symbiont intracellularis'. It is classified
in the delta subdivision of the Proteobacteria and is a
microaerophilic obligate intracellular pathogen which is
aetiologically implicated in proliferative enteropathy of
pigs and foals (McOrist et al.,1995; Lavoie et al., 2000). It
has been cultured in enterocyte cell lines (Lawson et al.,
1993).
Usual habitat
Lawsonia intracellularis grows intracellularly in pig
enterocytes and infected animals excrete small numbers in
their faeces (Smith and McOrist, 1997). It has been
recovered from the tissues of foals and other animals
affected with proliferative enteropathy, including hamsters,
deer and ostriches (Cooper et al., 1997). Pigs and foals
which are not clinically affected, but live on endemically-i
nfected premises, may also shed the organism in their
faeces, as may wildlife on such farms (Friedman et al.,
2008; Pusterla et al., 2008).
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Lawsonia intracellularis has an affinity for enterocytes, its
siteofreplication.Infection
induces
 enterocyte
937
proliferation with the development of adenomatous and
inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum, caecum and
colon. This proliferative enteropathy can be reproduced
experimentally
by
oral
dosing
10
conventional
specific-pathogen-free pigs with the pathogen. Gnotobiotic
pigs, which are devoid of intestinal flora, do not develop
the disease when dosed with L. ntracellularis unless they
are pre-dosed with porcine intestinal flora. There appears
to be a synergistic interaction between L. intracellularis
and common intestinal organisms such as Escherichia coli,
Clostridiumspecies
Sand
Bacteroides species. These
organisms
probably
provide
appropriate
microenvironmental
conditions
necessary
forthe
colonization and
proliferationofL.i
intraceliuiaris
(McOrist et al., 1994). In addition, active proliferation and
differentiation of crypt cells, as occurs at weaning, appear
to be a prerequisite for lesion production (McOrist et al.,
2006). The exact mechanism of infection has not been
established but the organism apparently attaches and enters
epithelial cells followed by release from the endosome and
multiplication free in the cytoplasm of the cells. Following
infection, crypt cells proliferate and migrate to populate
the surface of the epithelial lining of the terminal ileum,
caecum and colon.
Key points
- Curved, Gram-negative rods
- Obligate intracellular pathogens
·  Microaerophilic
· Does not grow on inert media
938
·Growth in tissue culture prepared from
enterocytes
· Implicated in proliferative enteropathy of pigs
and foals
Clinical signs
Porcine proliferative enteropathy, which occurs in weaned
pigs 6 to 12 weeks of age, is characterized by proliferative
and inflammatory changes in the terminal small intestine
and large intestine.
. Under field conditions, infection
usually occurs approximately 6 weeks post weaning with
shedding persisting for 2 to 6 weeks (Stege et al., 2004).
Clinical signs range from chronic intermittent diarrhoea
with reduction in weight gain to acute haemorrhagic
enteropathy. Although sudden deaths may occur in
severely affected pigs, most animals with the milder form
of the disease recover without treatment.
Lesions in the ileum, caecum and colon include thickening
of the wall, mucosal necrosis and, in severe cases, clotted
    g    
nodes is a feature of the disease.
In foals, clinical signs are seen in weanlings and include
rapid weight loss with diarrhoea and colic, depression,
fever and subcutaneous ventral oedema.
Diagnosis
·  Clinical signs and gross pathological findings may be
sufficient for a presumptive diagnosis.
939
·Lawsonia intracellularis can be demonstrated in faeces or
       
chain reaction technique. Multiplex PCR techniques for the
detection of  the common  porcine  intestinal  pathogens
Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Saimonella serovars and L.
intracellularis have been developed (Elder et af., 1997; Suh
and Song, 2005).
· The organism can be demonstrated in sections from lesions
by silver-impregnation stains or by immunostaining.
·Lawsonia intracellularis can be cultured only in enterocyte
cell lines.
·Serological
tests
include
【FA，
ELISA
and
immu-noperoxidase monolayer assays (Guedes et al., 2002 ).
Treatment and control
Antimicrobial agents such as tylosin or tiamulin may be used
prophylactically or therapeutically in feed or water.
Evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility of the organism is
difficult because it can be cultured only in cell lines.
Wattanaphansak et af.(2008)evaluated antimicrobial
activity in  both the
 intracellular   and  extracellular
environments and suggested that tiamulin and valnemulin
were most effective when intracellular activitywas
evaluated and valnemulin was most effective ex tracellularly.
· Zinc bacitracin incorporated into feed has been reported to
be effective in reducing the prevalence of intestinal lesions
(Kyriakis et al., 1996).
· Thorough  cleaning  and  disinfection  of   contaminated
premises should be carried out at the end of each production
cycle.
A live attenuated vaccine for use in pigs is now available in
many countries and is effective in reducing clinical signs of
disease.

Spirochaetes
The order Spirochaetales contains five families, three of
which,
Leptospiraceae,
Spirochaetaceae
and
Brachyspiraceae, contain  pathogens  of veterinary
importance (Fig. 36.1) (Ludwig et al., 2008). It comprises
spiral or helical bacteria (spirochaetes) which share some
unique morphological and functional features. Members of
the order are motile by means of endoflagella which are
located within the periplasm (Fig. 36.2). The genus
Leptospira within the family Leptospiraceae contains
pathogens of veterinary and human medical importance.
The genera Borrelia, Brachyspira and Treponema also
contain significant animal and human pathogens. There are
some nonpathogenic genera in each family.
Pathogenic spirochaetes are difficult to culture; many
require specialized media and some require liquid media.
Organisms in the group are classified on the basis of
genetic relatedness. Serological methods are used for
epidemiological investigations and clinical diagnosis.
Leptospira species
Members of this species (leptospires) are motile helical
bacteria (0.1 × 6 to 12 μm) with hook-shaped ends (Fig
36.3). They have two circular chromosomes, both of which
contain genesessential to survival.Although
cytochemically Gram-negative, they do not stain well with
conventional
1  bacteriological dyes  and  are usually
945
visualized
using
dark- f
field
microscopy.
Silver
impregnation and immunological staining techniques are
used to demonstrate leptospires in tissues. Leptospirosis,
which can affect all domestic animals and humans, ranges
in severity from mild infections of the urinary or genital
systems to serious systemic disease (Table 36.1).

Usual habitat
Leptospires can survive in ponds, rivers, surface waters,
moist soil and mud when environmental temperatures are
moderate. Pathogenic leptospires can persist in the renal
tubules or in the genital tract of carrier animals. Although
indirect transmission  can occur when environmental
conditions are favourable, these fragile organisms are
transmitted most effectively by direct contact.

imparts a cord-like appearance, and their hooked ends

pathogenic microorganisms.
Differentiation of Leptospira species
Formerly, leptospires were differentiated by serological
reactions and two species were recognized, L. interrogans
containing
pathogens  and L. biflexa  containing
saprophytes. Leptospiral species (genospecies) are now
classified by DNA homology and, within each species,
various serovars are recognized on the basis of serological
reactions (Ellis, 1995). Currently, there are 20 recognized
leptospiral species which can be classified into three
groups, pathogens, non-pathogens and organisms of
uncertain  pathogenicity   (Intermational  Committee   on
Systematics  of  Prokaryotes,  2008;
Cerqueiraand
Picardeau, 2009). Pathogenic leptospiral} species are listed
in Box 36.1. More than 250 pathogenic serovars in 24
serogroups are defined (Yasuda et al., 1987; Perolat et al.,
1998; Cerqueira and Picardeau, 2009 ). Cross - absorption
949
of rabbit antisera against defined serovars is used to
determine the serovar of an isolate. Serovars with antigens
in common belong to the same serogroup. The taxonomic
classification of leptospires based on genetic make-up has
resulted in the classification of some serologically similar
leptospires  in  different 
t species. Serovar
Hardjo,
fot
example, belongs to two species, L. borgpetersenii and L
interrogans, because common surface antigens are shared
by these two genetically distinct organisms. Serological
classification  remains
clinically
important
because
particular serovars tend to be associated with specific host
animals and crossimmunity between serovars is minimal.
Thus, identification and understanding of the infecting
serovar  is essential  for understanding and controlling
leptospiral infections.

Epidemiology
Although leptospires are found worldwide, some serovars
appear to have a limited geographical distribution. In
951
addition, most serovars are associated with a particular
hosts readily acquire infection, and disease is frequently
mild or subclinical and is often followed by prolonged
excretion of leptospires in urine. Maintenance hosts are the
main source of environmental contamination and of natural
incidental hosts. Incidental host species usually exhibit low
susceptibility to infection, develop severe disease and are
inefficient transmitters of leptospires to other animals.
Recent genomic studies have shown that some pathogenic
leptospires have  extremely
limited
1 survival
in the
environment. Serovars in the species L. borgpetersenii do
not survive in the environment in contrast to L. interrogans
which shows prolonged survival in suitable habitats such
as surface waters (Bulach et al., 2006; Xue et al., 2009).
The maintenance hosts and the commonly infected
incidental hosts of some serovars of L. interrogans are
presented in Table 36.2. Many factors, including virulence
of the infecting serovar and immune status of the host,
influence the outcome of infection in different host
species.

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
The pathogenicity of leptospires relates to the virulence of
the infecting serovar and the susceptibility of the host
species. Although disease may be severe in immature
maintenance hosts, serious disease occurs most commonly
inincidentalhosts.There is
limited  information on
Leptospires invade tissues through moist, softened skin or
through mucous membranes; motility may aid tissue
invasion. They spread throughout  the body  via the
bloodstream but, following the appearance of antibodies at
about 10 days after infection, they are cleared from the
circulation. Some organisms may evade the immune
response and persist in the body, principally in the renal
tubules but also in the uterus, eye or meninges. The exact
mechanisms whereby the organisms persist in these sites
despite a specific immune response by the host are unclear.
In maintenance hosts, such as the rat colonized by serovar
Copenhageni, it appears that initially the leptospires
produce little damage to the kidney and do not evoke a
significant local cellular immune response, despite the
occurrence of leptospiruria from day 7 onwards (Monahan
et al., 2009). Although mild to severe interstitial nephritis
develops from 1 month after infection, leptospiruria may
persist for the life of the rat. Downregulation of expression
of antigenic proteins on the surface of the leptospires or
differential expression of proteins during chronic infection
953
have been suggested as possible mechanisms allowing the
persistence of leptospires in the face of a specific immune
response (Monahan et al, 2009). Binding of complement
regulatory proteins such as plasma factor H by pathogenic
leptospires may also play a role in immune evasion.
Virulence factors of leptospires have not been fully
characterized but the organisms do not appear to produce
specific secreted toxins. Toxic components appear to be
closely cell-associated and include outer membrane
proteins. The LPS of leptospires has much less endotoxic
activity than endotoxin of other Gramnegative organisms
and activates the host immune response via TLR-2 rather
than through the TLR-4 pathway. Initial adherence to host
cells may be mediated through binding of leptospiral
surface proteins such as a fibronectin-binding protein to
host cell extracellular matrix proteins (Merien et al., 2o00),
There is evidence that chemotaxis of leptospires to
haemoglobin may be involved in the initiation of infection
(Yuri et al., 1993). Leptospires can evade phagocytosis in
the bloodstream, possibly by inducing macrophage
apoptosis (Merien et al., 1997). It has been suggested that,
following attachment to host cells, the organisms gain
entry by receptor-mediated endocytosis (Merien et al..
1997). In susceptible animals, damage to red cell
membranes and
to
endothelial
cells along with
hepatocellular injury
produces
haemolvtic
anaemia
jaundice, haemoglobinuria and haemorrhage, associated
with acute leptospirosis. Pulmonary haemorrhage is a
significant lesion in peracute cases of disease in humans
(Dolhnikoff et al., 2007). Pathogenic leptospires contain
many  haemolysins including sphingomyelinases  which
may be responsible in part for the lesions described
954
Diagnostic procedures
 Diagnosis of leptospirosis in maintenance hosts usually
requires screening of a defined population.

a a  p a o o a  s
days of infection and from urine approximately 2 weeks
after initial infection either by culture in liquid medium or by
animal inoculation. Slow-growing serovars such as Hardjo
may require incubation for 6 months in liquid media at 30°C.
Commonly, EMJH (Ellinghausen, McCullough, Johnson and
Harris) medium, based on 1% bovine serum albumin and
Tween 80, is used for isolation. Tween provides the
long-chain fatty acids required as nutrients and albumin
adsorbs these compounds
and releases them slowly as they are toxic to the leptospires
if present in high concentrations.
·Isolates should be identified using DNA profiles and
serology. Many different methods for typing leptospiral
isolates  have been  investigated  with genomic
 macrorestriction with rare cutting endonucleases followed by
pulsed field gel electrophoresis currently regarded as the
gold standard (Cerqueira and Picardeau, 2009). Agreement
between PFGE results and serotyping is frequently good
although discrepancies have been reported.
· Fluorescent antibody procedures are often used for the
demonstration of leptospires in tissues. Suitable tissues
include kidney and liver. Silver impregnation techniques can
also be used for demonstration of leptospires in tissues.
· DNA hybridization, PCR, magnetic immunocapture PCR
and immunomagnetic antigen capture systems have also
been developed for the demonstration of leptospiral infection
in tissues and urine. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR
assays are now available and are useful for the evaluation of
newly developed vaccines, for the study of pathogenesis and
955
transmission of leptospirosis, and for diagnosis (Fearnley et
af., 2008; Lourdault et af., 2009 ).
· The standard serological reference test, the microscopic
agglutination test, is potentially hazardous because it
involves mixing live culture growing in liquid medium with
equal volumes of doubling dilutions of test serum. Titres in
excess of 1:400 or a fourfold rise in the titre in paired
samples are diagnostically significant when accompanied by
clinical  signs  consistent  with leptospirosis. Serological
diagnosis of host-adapted leptospirosis is difficult as titres
may be decreasing or absent when clinical signs are
observed. Some hostadapted serovars, notably Hardjo in
cattle, may elicit a poor immune response with the result that
infection and prolonged urinary excretion occur without
significant titres developing.
· A number of ELISA tests, developed in particular countries.
are based on the predominant serovars occurring in those
countries.
Clinical infections
The disease  conditions  associated   with   leptospiral
infections in domestic animals are presented in Table 36.1.
Leptospirosis in cattle and sheep
Cattle are maintenance hosts for L. borgpetersenii serovar
Hardjo and there is increasing evidence that this serovar is
also host-adapted for sheep and deer (Cousins et al., 1989;
Ayanegui-Alcerreca et al., 2007). Leptospira interrogans
serovar Hardjo is also hostadapted for cattle. Although L.
cases of disease in cattle, it may be more virulent than L.
borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo (Ellis et al., 1988).
Susceptible replacement heifers, reared separately and
introduced into an infected dairy herd for the first time at
956
calving, may develop acute disease with pyrexia and
agalactia affecting all quarters. Infection may also result in
abortions and stillbirths. If management practices allow
exposure to infection and the subsequent development of
immunity before breeding age, reproductive problems may
not develop. Agalactia caused by leptospiral infection can
be confirmed by demonstrating a rising antibody titre in
paired serum samples. Infection with serovar Hardjo in
sheep, particularly in intensively managed lowland flocks,
can cause abortions and agalactia. Antimicrobial treatment
with agents such as dihydrostreptomycin or amoxicillin
can be used for reducing or eliminating urinary excretion
of the organisms. Both monovalent and multivalent
inactivated vaccines, which are commercially available
may not always be effective. The serovars incorporated
into vaccines should be those that are associated with
disease in a particular region. Infection with serovars
Pomona, Grippotyphosa and Icterohaemorrhagiae can
cause serious disease, particularly in calves and lambs.
Infection    is    usually   accompanied   by   pyrexia,
haemoglobinuria, jaundice and anorexia. Extensive renal
damage with resultant uraemia often precedes death.
Vaccination is used for control of serovar Pomona which is
Leptospirosis in horses
Although serological evidence of leptospiral infection is
common in horses, clinical disease is infrequent. Infection
with serovar Bratislava, which has been associated with
abortions and stillbirths in horses, may be maintained in
the equine species. Clinical disease most often results from
incidental infection with serovar Pomona, although other
957
mares and renal disease in young horses. Equine recurrent
uveitis (periodic ophthalmia, ‘moon blindness') may be a
manifestation of chronic leptospirosis in horses. This
condition may be associated with persistent infection of
the eye with leptospires (Wollanke et al., 200l). In
addition, cross-reactions between leptospiral antigens and
proteins from the cornea and lens suggest that autoimmune
mechanisms may be involved (Parma
et al., 1992). Leptospiral vaccines are not currently
licensed for use in horses.
Leptospirosis in pigs
Acute   leptospirosis
 in pigs  is usually caused by
rodentadapted serovars such as Icterohaemorrhagiae and
Copenhageni. These serovars cause serious, sometimes
fatal disease in young pigs with signs similar to those of
acute leptospirosis in other species. In many parts of the
world, the principal host-adapted serovar is Pomona. Pigs
subclinically infected with Pomona may shed leptospires
in their urine for extended periods. Infection can result in
reproductive failure including abortions and stillbirths.
Pigs also serve as maintenance hosts for serovars
Tarassovi and Bratislava, which may
/alsocause
reproductive failure.
Leptospirosis in dogs and cats
The serovars associated with leptospirosis in dogs are
Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae. The widespread use of
emergence of serovars Grippotyphosa, Bratislava and
958
Pomona as important pathogens for dogs (Rentko et al.,
1992). Infection is most common in male dogs aged 4 to 7
years, with hunting dogs more at risk (Stokes and
Forrester, 2004). In addition, infection levels are linked to
season (late summer and early autumn) and to increased
rainfall. Serovar Canicola, which is host-adapted for dogs,
causes severe renal disease in pups. In animals that survive
the acute phase, a chronic uraemic syndrome may
subsequently develop. Incidental canine infections caused
by Icterohaemorrhagiae, Copenhageni or Pomona are
characterized by acute haemorrhagic disease or subacute
hepatic and renal failure. In incidental canine infections
duetoserovars
 other   than   Icterohaemorrhagiae
or
Copenhageni,  signs
of  renalinvolvement  usually
predominate. It is considered that serovar Bratislava,
which has been associated with abortion and infertility, is
becoming adapted to dogs which may act as maintenance
hosts. j
Bacterins
which
contain  onlyS
serovars
Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola do not induce immunity
against other serovars. Although clinical leptospirosis is
uncommon in cats, infections with a number of serovars
have been reported (Agunloye and Nash, 1996).
Control
Prevention of leptospirosis  in domestic animals relies
primarily on the use of vaccination. As immunity is
serovar specific, vaccines should contain the prevalent
leptospiral serovars present in the geographical region in
question. Current vaccines are usually bacterins, and
immunity must be boosted at least annually. Immunity
following    natural  infection   is  almost   entirely
antibody-based but some vaccines appear to induce a TH1
959
cell-mediated immune response also (Naiman et al., 2001)
Recent studies on vaccine development have concentrated
on the development of a subunit vaccine. Ideally, such a
vaccine would consist of a recombinant protein which
conferred cross protection against a number of pathogenic
serovars.
Public health aspects
Leptospirosis is an occupational disease of abattoir
workers, dairy and pig farmers, veterinary surgeons and
those engaged in manual work related to sewage and
drainage. It is a zoonosis of increasing importance in those
who partake in water sports, in particular those sports that
may result in bruising or scratching of the skin, such as
whitewater rafting, as injury to the skin facilitates invasion
by leptospires.
Borrelia species
Borreliae, which are longer and wider than other
spirochaetes, have a similar helical shape (Fig. 36.4). In
addition to a linear chromosome, which is unique among
bacteria, borreliae possess linear and circular plasmids.
some of which appear to be essential for growth and
survival of the organism. Although these spirochaetes can
cause disease in animals and humans, subclinical
infections are also common. Borreliae are transmitted by
arthropod vectors. Borrelia species of importance in
animals, their arthropod vectors, and the diseases which
they cause are summarized in Table 36.3.
Usual habitat
960
Borreliae are obligate parasites in a variety of vertebrate
hosts. Although these organisms persist in the environment
for short periods, they depend on vertebrate reservoir hosts
and arthropod vectors for longterm survival. Associations
of certain Borrelia species with particular arthropod
vectors and reservoir hosts are important in determining
the epidemiology of infections with Borrelia species.

Differentiation of Borrelia species
Borreliae can be differentiated from other spirochaetes by
their morphology, by the low guanine and cytosine content
of their genomic DNA and by ecological, cultural and
biochemical characteristics. Identification of Borrelia
species depends mainly on genetic analysis. At least 13
961
genospecies or genomic groups of B. burgdorferi sensu
lato have been identified using DNA- DNA hybridization.
16S rRNA sequencing and other molecular techniques. A
limited number of these species are pathogenic (Rudenko
et al., 2009).
Clinical infections
The species of particular veterinary importance are B.
burgdorferi sensu lato, the cause of Lyme disease in
animals and humans, and B. anserina which causes avian
borreliosis. The significance of two other species, B.
theileri and B. coriaceae, as animal pathogens is uncertain.
Lyme disease
This condition, also known as Lyme borreliosis, was first
identified in 1975 following investigation of a cluster of
arthritis cases in children near the town of Old Lyme,
Connecticut. The causative agent, a spirochaete, was
named Borrelia burgdorferi. Several genospecies of B.
burgdorferi have subsequently been identified in the USA
and Europe. Although B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the
principal genotype isolated in the USA, genetic diversity
among isolates has been documented (Oliver, 1996;
Rudenko et al., 2009 ). The recognized species of B.
burgdorferi sensu lato are presented in Box 36.2.
Epidemiology
Lyme disease has been reported in humans, dogs, horses
and cattle, and infection has been documented in sheep.
Ticks are the only competent vectors of B. burgdorferi
962
sensu lato. Infection is usually acquired by larval stages of
ticks feeding on small rodents. A variety of small wild
animals including mice, voles, hedgehogs, lizards and
birds can act as reservoir hosts. The spirochaetes persist
infection while feeding. Adult ticks feed preferentially on
large mammals such as deer and sheep, which are
maintenance hosts for the tick population but are
unsuitable reservoirs for B. burgdorferi sensu lato. The
persistence of these pathogenic bacteria in a region is
dependent on the presence of suitable reservoir hosts for
borreliae and maintenance hosts for ticks. The most
common tick vector for B. burgdorferi sensu lato in
Europe is Xxodes ricinus; in central and eastern USA it is I.
scapularis; on the west coast of the USA it is I. pacificus,
and in Eurasia it is I. persulcatus. The relationships
between B. burgdorferi sensu lato, its hosts and tick
vectors are shown in Fig. 36.5. Transovarial transmission
of the spirochaete in the tick, which may occur
infrequently, is not of epidemiological importance.
Occasional  transmission of borreliae from  infected
incidental hosts to uninfected ticks may occur.

Pathogenesis
964
Transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu lato occurs when an
infected tick feeds on a susceptible animal. Prior to
feeding, the spirochaetes are restricted to the midgut of the
ticks and, following ingestion of blood, they are found in
the salivary glands. Following ingestion of blood by the
tick, a change occurs in the expression of the outer surface
protein (Osp) of the borreliae. Osp A is expressed in the
midgut of the tick and is involved in adherence by the
borreliae to the gut of the tick. However, during feeding,
Osp A expression is rapidly down-regulated as it is a
potent stimulator of the immune response of the
mammalian host. In contrast, Osp C is up-regulated and
helps
to
protect  the borreliae
by
binding
a
complement-inactivating component
tintick saliva.
Complement-binding  proteins  are  produced
1bythe
borreliae themselves also and help
1n
resisting
complement-mediated killing by the host.
After entering the bloodstream of a susceptible host,
borreliae multiply and are disseminated throughout the
body. Organisms may be demonstrated in joints, brain,
nerves, eyes and heart. Whether disease is caused by active
infection or by host immune responses to the organism is
unclear. Persistent infection leading to the induction of
cytokines may contribute to the development of lesions
(Sprenger et al., 1997 ; Straubinger et al., 1997; Roberts et
al., 1998). There may be an association between different
genotypes of B. burgdorferi and particular clinical
frequently associated with arthritis, B. garinii with
Dam et al., 1993 ).
965
Clinical signs
Most infections are subclinical. Serological  surveys
demonstrate that exposure is common in both animal and
human populations in endemic areas (Santino et al., 1997).
The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease relate mainly
to the sites of localization of the organisms.
Clinical disease is reported frequently in dogs. Signs
include fever, lethargy, arthritis and evidence of cardiac,
renal or neurological disturbance. In the USA, arthritis is a
common finding whereas neurological disturbance is the
most frequent clinical feature in Europe and Japan. The
clinical signs in horses are similar to those in dogs and
include lameness, uveitis, nephritis, hepatitis and
encephalitis. However, some authors maintain that
definitive evidence of clinical Lyme disease in horses is
lacking (Butler et al., 2005). Lameness in cattle and sheep
associated with B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection has
been reported.
Diagnosis
Laboratory confirmationof Lyme disease may prove
difficult because the spirochaetes may be present in low
numbers in specimens from clinically affected animals. In
addition, the organism is fastidious in its cultural
requirements.
·A history of exposure to tick infestation in an endemic area
in association with characteristic clinical signs may suggest
Lyme disease.
 Rising antibody titres to B. burgdorferi sensu lato along with
typical clinical signs are indicative of disease. Because
966
subclinical infections are common in endemic areas, high
titres alone are not confirmatory. The ELISA is extensively
used for antibody detection; western immunoblotting is
sometimes used for confirmation of ELISA results. A
quantitative ELISA based on the detection of antibodies to
C6 peptide is used in humans and may be useful in dogs also
(Littman et af., 2006). It has been shown that ELISA
techniques based on this antigen may be able to differentiate
naturally infected and vaccinated animals (O'Connor et af.,
2004).
· Immunofluorescence assays may also be used but the results
of these methods may be difficult to interpret.
·Culture of borreliae from clinically affected animals is
confirmatory. Cultures in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium
should be incubated for 6 weeks under microaerophilic
conditions andshould be carriedout in specialized
laboratories.
· Low numbers of borreliae can be detected in samples by
PCR techniques. These techniques are most useful in early
cases of Lyme disease in humans in which 50 to 70% of skin
biopsies of erythema migrans lesions may be positive
(Wilske et af., 2007). Similar results have been obtained
with synovial fluid samples. As domestic animals do not
usually show lesions of erythema migrans, PCR-based tests
may be less useful than in humans. PCR techniques can alsc
be used for identifying genospecies and for epidemiological
investigations (K urtenbach et al., 1998).
Treatment and control
·Acute Lyme disease responds to treatment with amoxicillin
and oxytetracycline. In chronic disease, prolonged or
repeated courses of treatment may be required.
·Acaricidal sprays, baths or dips should be used to control
tick infestation. Where feasible, tick habitats such as rough
brush and scrub should be cleared.
·Prompt removal of ticks from companion animals may
       
transmit spirochaetes shortly after attachment, it cannot be
967
assumed that daily removal of ticks will prevent infection
(Korenberg and Moskvitina, 1996 ).
·A number of vaccines, including whole cell bacterins and
recombinant subunit vaccines, are commercially available
for use in dogs in some countries. An OspA recombinant
vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies which are

vaccinating  dogs  with  currently   available  vaccines  is
disputed (Littman, 2003 ; Littman et al., 2006).
Public health aspects
humans. Clinical signs include skin rash localized at the
site of tick attachment, followed, in the absence of
treatment, by arthritis, muscle pains, and cardiac and
neurological abnormalities. Infection is often acquired by
walking in endemic areas during periods of tick activity.
Dogs, cats and farm animals may act as transport hosts for
infected ticks thereby exposing humans to the risk of
infection.
Avian spirochaetosis
This acute disease of birds, caused by Borrelia anserina,
can result in significant economic loss in flocks in tropical
and subtropical regions where the disease is endemic.
Chickens, turkeys, pheasants, ducks and geese are
susceptible to infection. Soft ticks of the genus Argas
frequently transmit the disease. However, when there is
contact between susceptible birds and infected material
such as blood, tissues or excreta, transmission may occur.
Because B. anserina survives poorly in the environment
and for a limited time in infected birds, Argas ticks are
968
important reservoirs of the organisms. The borreliae
survive trans-stadial moulting in ticks and can be
transmitted transovarially
between  tick
Kgenerations.
 Outbreaks of avian
spirochaetosis coincide with periods of peak tick activity
during warm, humid seasons. Morbidity and mortality are
low in flocks continually exposed to infection. The disease
is characterized by fever, marked anaemia and weight loss.
Paralysis may
 develop   as  the  disease progresses.
Immunity, which follows recovery, is serotype specific.
Several serotypes may be present in a particular region.
Diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstration of the
spirochaetes  in buffy  coat smears using dark-field
microscopy. Blood or tissue smears can also be examined
using immunofluorescence. Giemsa - stained smears or
silver impregnation techniques can be used to demonstrate
the borreliae in tissues. The organisms are usually isolated
by inoculating embryonated eggs or young chicks with
infected blood or homogenized tissues. PCR techniques
have been applied for the characterization of B. anserina
strains (Ataliba et al., 2007). Treatment with antibiotics is
effective. Inactivated vaccines and tick eradication are the
main control measures.
Brachyspira and Treponema species
Five species of brachyspires have been isolated from pigs,
namely Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, B.pilosicoli,B.
intermedia, B. innocens and B. murdochii, the latter two
considered to be non-pathogenic. Brachyspira intermedia
has  been  associated  with  intestinal  spirochaetosis in
chickens and
I pigs.
Treponema
lparaluiscuniculiis
969
associated with vent disease in rabbits, and a number of
Treponema species have been identified in lesions of
bovine digital  dermatitis and  contagious  ovine digital
dermatitis. Brachyspira and Treponema species have six to
fourteen spirals and are 0.1 to 0.5 μm in width (Fig. 36.4).
Usual habitat
Pathogenic Brachyspira species are found in the intestinal
tract of both clinically affected and normal pigs. Carrier
pigs can shed B. hyodysenteriae for up to 3 months and are
the principal source  of infection for healthy  pigs.
Brachyspira pilosicoli colonizes the intestinal tract of
chickens, dogs, wild birds, rodents and non-human
primates and is recognized as an important cause of colitis
and typhilitis in pigs and poultry.
Differentiation of Brachyspira species
The differentiation of B.hyocysenteriae from other
intestinal spirochaetes is based on its pattern of haemolysis
on blood agar. Tests for detecting indole production or the
hydrolysis of hippurate are also useful  diagnostically
(Table 36.4). Restriction endonuclease analysis, restriction
fragment length polymorphism, ribotyping using 16S
rRNA analysis, PCR-based assays and multilocus enzyme
electrophoresis
have
been
developed
both徳for
differentiating species and for distinguishing strains of
organisms within species. A scheme based on multilocus
sequence typing has been developed to examine the
diversityand genetic relatedness of Brachyspira
hyodysenteriaeisolates.Brachyspirahyodysenteriae
970
strains can also be allocated to several serogroups and
serotypes.

Pathogenesis
Most information on the pathogenesis of Brachyspira
species derives from studies of B. hyodysenteriae. Motility
in mucus is an essential virulence factor of this organism;
mutant strains with altered motility are less capable of
colonizing the pig intestine (Kennedy et al., 1997).
Colonization may be enhanced by factors in mucus with
chemotactic activity for the organisms. Factors with such
chemotactic activities have been demonstrated in vitro
(Kennedy and Yancey, 1996). Haemolytic activity,
demonstrated in vitro, correlates with pathogenicity, and
six genes encoding haemolytic and cytotoxic activity have
been identified (Muir et al., 1992; ter Huurne et al., 1994;
Hampson and Ahmed, 2009). In addition, proteases

development of disease (Jacobson et al., 2004; Jonasson et
al., 2004; Thomsen et al., 2007).
The pathogenesis of infection with B. pilosicoli differs
from that of B. hyodysenteriae in that attachment of the
important. Attachment of B. pilosicoli to the epithelial
cells of the colonic mucosa leads to disruption of function
with resultant cell shedding and oedema.
Clinical infections
Infections with Brachyspira species are of importance in
pigs. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae,the cause of swine
dysentery, and B. pilosicoli, the cause of porcine intestinal
spirochaetosis, are recognized
 pathogens.  There is
evidence that B. intermedia may be associated with
porcine spirochaetal colitis, but this has not been
confirmed experimentally. Pigs acquire infection through
exposure to contaminated faeces. The disease usually
spreads slowly through a herd, affecting only one or two
pens at a time. Dogs, rats, mice and flies may act as
transport hosts for the spirochaetes. Mice populations can
maintain B. hyodysenteriae. Although strains of B.
pilosicoli have been found in many species including
humans, dogs, chickens and pheasants, cross-infection
between species has not  been  clearly demonstrated.
Colonic spirochaetosis, which causes wet faeces and poor
production in chicken flocks, may be underdiagnosed
(Smith, 2005). Brachyspira species can survive in the
environment for limited periods only if protected from
desiccation. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae can persist for
972
several weeks in moist faeces and for at least 3 days in
slurry.
Clinical signs
The pathogenic Brachyspira species and the clinical
conditions associated with infection are presented in Table
36.5.Infection with B. hyodysenteriae causes dysentery
which is most often encountered in weaned pigs from 6 to
12 weeks of age. Affected pigs lose condition and become
emaciated. Appetite is decreased and thirst may be evident.
During recovery, there may be large amounts of mucus in
the faeces. Although mortality is low, reduced weight gain
due to poor food conversion causes major economic loss.

Previously, enteric

　had
1   been  produced
experimentally by infecting pigs with a weakly haemolytic
spirochaete (Taylor et al., 1980). The clinical signs in
porcine intestinal spirochaetosis are similar to those of
swine dysentery but are less severe. Diarrhoea contains
efficiency with poor weight gains has a major effect on
production.

Diagnosis
History, clinical signs and gross lesions may indicate swine
dysentery.
 Blood agar with added antibiotics is used for the culture of
Brachyspira species. Cultures are incubated anaerobically at
42°C for at least 3 days. Complete haemolysis is present
around colonies of B. hyodysenteriae; other enteric
spirochaetes are weakly haemolytic (Table 36.4).
Definitive identification 
can
be
made
using
immunofluorescence, DNA probes or biochemical tests
(Table 36.4).
Serological tests such as ELISA can be used to investigate
infection in herds.
· PCR-based techniques have been developed and may be
useful for direct detection of B. hyodysenteriae in clinical
samples and for laboratory confirmation of isolates.
Real-time PCR techniques have been developed also (Akase
et al., 2009).
Treatment and control
Medication of drinking water is a useful method of
treatment. Drugs commonly used include tiamulin,
lincomycin and the nitroimidazoles. Improved hygiene,
medication of feed and alteration of the diet may assist in
controlling infection. Depopulation, thorough cleaning and
disinfection of premises and strict rodent control are
required for eradication of the disease. Whole cell bacterin
vaccines are available for control of swine dysentery in
some countries but their efficacy is uncertain
Treponema species
974
A number of Treponema species have been isolated from
cases of bovine digital dermatitis and from the recently
described condition of contagious ovine digital dermatitis.
Several species may be present within the same herd and
even within the same individual animal (Evans et al.,
2009).  The  pathogenic
Cmechanismsleading to
development of lesions are poorly understood but
spirochaetes can be demonstrated deep in infected tissue.
The involvement of Treponema species in digital lameness
of cattle and sheep is described in greater detail in Chapter
91.

Chapter 37
Pathogenic  anaerobic non-spore-forming  Gram-negative
bacteria
Many
Inon-spore-forming,
anaerobic,  Gram-negative
bacteria cause opportunistic mixed infections, often in
association   with    facultative    anaerobes.   Synergistic
interactions between the organisms in these mixed
infections are common. Fusobacterium species and
bacteria from the genera Prevotella, Dichelobacter and
Porphyromonas constitute more than 50% of the anaerobic
organisms isolated from these infections.
Usual habitat
Non-spore-forming, Gram-negative anaerobes are often
found on mucous membranes of animals and humans,
particularly in the digestive and urinogenital tracts. They
are excreted in the faeces and they can survive for short
periods in the environment. Dichelobacter nodosus, a
primary pathogen of the epidermal tissues of the hoof
region of ruminants, survives for less than 7 days in the
environment.
Diagnostic procedures
·In order to ensure that isolates of anaerobes are
aetiologically significant, specimens for isolation procedures
should be obtained by direct sampling from discharges or
lesions and by suprapubic puncture in urinary infections.
 Specimens should be processed promptly after collection.
Commercial kits and transport media are available for
985
specimens from suspected anaerobic infections. In the core
of a tissue specimen over 2 cm’, an anaerobic
microenvironment is usually maintained. A fluid sample,
collected in a syringe, remains suitable for anaerobic culture
if air is expelled from the syringe and the needle is plugged.
· Anaerobic jars with an atmosphere of hydrogen and 10%
CO2 are used for incubating cultures at 37°C for up to 7
days. Anaerobic bags or pouches are available also and are
suitable for culturing small numbers of samples
•Blood agar (5to 10% ruminant red blood
cells)
supplemented with yeast extract, vitamin K and haemin, is
used for the isolation of anaerobes. Selective media can be
 prepared by adding appropriate antimicrobial agents. Media
        
atmosphere for at least 6 hours before inoculation. Special
media for the isolation of anaerobes are available
commercially.
· Liquid media, such as cooked meat broth or thioglycollate
medium supplemented with vitamin K and haemin, are
useful for subculturing and may be used as a back-up source
of culture material but are unsuitable for primary isolation.
 Special selective media are required for the isolation of
Dicheiobacter nodosus from ruminant footrot (Skerman,
1989). In some media formulations, powdered ovine hoof is
added to promote enhanced growth.
· Molecular methods based on PCR amplification or nucleic
acid probes have been developed for the detection of
anaerobic organisms in clinical specimens, particularly for
Dichelobacter nodosus, as footrot is a disease of major
economic importance in sheep (La Fontaine et af., 1993
Zhou et al., 2001).

Differentiation of the non-spore-forming Gram-negative
anaerobes
Non-spore-forming    Gram-negative    anaerobes 
are
differentiated on  the basis of bacterial morphology,
colonial appearance, antibiotic susceptibility testing and
fatty acid production.
·Rods of Dichelobacter nodosus are thick, straight or slightly
spua yoq 1o auo e agqnq pue suol wr 9 0 dn 'paa1no
Fusobacterium necrophorum has irregularly staining, long,
non-branching filamentous forms (Fig. 37.1).
· Colonies of Gram-negative anaerobes usually have a foetid
Or putrid odour due to volatile fatty acid production.
- The appearance of Dichelobacter nodosus colonies is
variable (Stewart et af., 1986). Colonies of virulent strains
from lesions of ovine footrot usually have a dark central
zone, a pale granular middle zone and a spreading irregular
periphery with a ground glass appearance.

·Methods for detecting virulent strains of D. nodosus,
reviewed by Wani and Samanta (2006), include:
- Elastin and gelatin gel tests for detection of protease
activity.
- ELISA, using monoclonal antibodies against D. nodosus
 proteases and other antigens.
 Polymerase chain reaction techniques for detection of
virulence-specific genes.
988
- Molecular tests are also used for grouping strains of D.
nodosus. PCR techniques using serogroup-specific primers
have largely replaced conventional serogrouping (Wani and
Samanta, 2006 ).
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Non-spore-forming  anaerobes  usually  exert  pathogenic
effects when anatomical barriers are breached allowing
invasion of underlying tissues. They replicate only at low
or negative reduction potentials (Eh). Most of the bacteria
involved in opportunistic infections produce superoxide
dismutase which allows them to survive in oxygenated
tissues until the Eh reaches levels favouring their growth.
Tissue trauma and necrosis followed by multiplication of
facultatively anaerobic bacteria can lower Eh levels to a
range suitable for the proliferation of non-spore-forming
anaerobes. Most infections involving these organisms are
mixed. Two or more bacterial species, interacting
synergistically, may produce lesions which the individual
organisms cannot produce. A relevant example of this type
of synergism is the production of a heat-labile factor by
necrophorum replication (Smith et al., 1989). In turm, F.
the strain virulence and aids survival of A. pyogenes
(Emery et al., 1984). Synergism between F. necrophorum
and  Dichelobacter   nodosus  is  important  in   the
pathogenesis of ruminant pedal lesions (Fig. 37.2). In this
instance, F. necrophorum facilitates tissue invasion by D.
nodosus and is itself stimulated by a growth factor
elaborated by D. nodosus.

activity and is more virulent than F. necrophorum subsp.
funduliforme. Strains of F. necrophorum which produce
oral, paraoral and necrotizing pneumonic infections in
horses have been classified as a new species, F. equinum
(Dorsch et al., 2001; Tadepalli et al., 2008). However, it is
unclear at present whether all fusobacterial infections in
horses are caused by this species or whether strains of F.
necrophorum maybe involved also.
Fusobacterium necrophorum produces a wide range of
virulence factors in addition to leukotoxin, including
haemagglutinins,
haemolysins,
dermotoxin,  other
extracellular enzymes and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which
contribute to the development of ruminal lesions. Of these,
the most important virulence determinants are leukotoxin,
haemagglutinins and LPS (Tadepalli et al., 2009). The
990
haemagglutinins  function  as  adhesins  and  promote
adherence to, and invasion of, ruminal epithelial cells. The
leukotoxin is active against ruminant neutrophils in
particular but may also act against macrophages and
hepatocytes. In contrast, it is only moderately toxic for
equine neutrophils and has little or no activity against
neutrophils of pigs and rabbits. Endotoxin from LPS is
important in the genesis of hepatic abscesses and induces
an intense neutrophilia
Characteristics of D. nodosus which correlate with its
ability to damage tissues include the production of
thermostable proteases and elastase and the presence of
agarolytic  activity on agar-based
d mediacontaining
powdered hoof. The production of Type IV fimbriae,
encoded by the fimA gene, is central to virulence and these
highly immunogenic structures form the basis of
classification of D. nodosus strains into 10 serogroups.

Clinical infections
The non - spore - forming, Gram - negative anaerobic
bacteria that have been implicated in infections in
domestic animals are listed in Box 37.1. Brachyspira
hyodysenteriae is discussed in Chapter 36.
Fusobacterium necrophorum is considered to be the
primary pathogen in a number of disease conditions in
farm animals (Table 37.1). Mixed bacterial infections are
commonly
implicated  in   foot  lesions  in  domestic
ruminants and pigs (Table 37.2). Pedal bacterial infections
in farm animals, such as footrot and foot abscessation, are
discussed in detail in Chapter 91. Mixed infections with
non - spore - forming anaerobes are also present in
aspiration    pneumonias
and
in bovine 
traumatic
reticuloperitonitis and pericarditis. In addition, many
inflammatory conditions in domestic carnivores are caused
by non-specific mixed anaerobic pathogens.

b, facultatively anaerobic.
Calf diphtheria
This condition usually presents as necrotic pharyngitis or
laryngitis in calves under 3 months of age. The aetiological
agent, F. necrophorum, can enter through abrasions in the
mucosa of the pharynx or larynx often caused by ingestion
of coarse feed. Clinical signs include fever, depression,
anorexia, excessive salivation, respiratory distress and a
foul smell from the mouth. Untreated calves may develop
a fatal necrotizing pneumonia. Treatment with potentiated
sulphonamides or tetracyclines early in the course of the
disease is usually effective.
Bovine liver abscess
Hepatic abscessation in cattle, secondary to rumenitis, is
encountered most commonly in feedlot animals. The
feeding of rations high in carbohydrates and the resulting
rapid  intraruminal
 fermentation
can
lead tothe
development of rumenitis, ulcers and abscesses in the
ruminal wall. High levels of lactate produced during
ruminal   acidosis   may   favour 
the
growthofF.
necrophorum as lactic acid is a major substrate for the
organism. Fusobacterium necrophorum is sensitive to pH,
994
and the number of organisms in ruminal contents decreases
markedly when the pH drops below pH 5.0. However, the
pH of the ruminal wall microenviron
ment is likely to remain close to pH 7.0 even during
ruminal acidosis, thus allowing survival and multiplication
ofthe organism.Fusobacterium necrophorum together
with other anaerobes and Arcanobacterium pyogenes
invade the tissues of the ruminal wall, and occasionally
abscess formation. Affected cattle rarely show clinical
signs, and lesions are usually detected at slaughter;
nevertheless, production losses in terms of reduced weight
gain and feed conversion efficiency may be considerable.
Management in feedlots should be aimed at reducing the
incidence of rumenitis. Although chlortetracycline, tylosin
or other antimicrobial agents administered in feed during
the finishing period can reduce the prevalence of liver
abscesses, this practice is no longer recommended owing
to concerns about the development of antimicrobial
resistance. Vaccines are available in some countries to
protect against liver abscesses but their efficacy appears to
be questionable (Fox et al., 2009)
Necrotic rhinitis of pigs
This sporadic condition, primarily affecting young pigs, is
characterized by suppuration and necrosis of the snout as a
result of infection withF.
.necrophorum, often in
association with other anaerobes. These organisms enter
through abrasions in the nasal mucosa. Signs include
swelling of the face, sneezing and a foulsmelling nasal
discharge. In chronic infections, involvement of the nasal
and facial bones can result in permanent facial deformity
995
(bull nose'). Potentiated sulphonamides administered
early in the course of the infection may be beneficial.
Thrush of the hoof
This necrotic condition of the equine hoof is associated
with poor hygiene, wet conditions and lack of regular
cleaning of the hooves. Infection with F. necrophorum,
secondary to hoof damage, results in a localized
inflammatory response. Thrush, which commonly affects
the hind feet, is characterized by a foul-smelling discharge
in the sulci close to the frog. The aim of therapy is to
encourage regeneration of the frog by providing dry, clean
stabling, regular attention to the hooves and exercise.
Black spot of bovine teats
Black spot or black pox of the teat orifice and sphincter of
dairy cows presents as a localized area of necrosis with
black scab formation due to invasion by F. necrophorum.
The condition can contribute to stenosis of the sphincter
and may predispose to mastitis.
Other conditions
A number of other conditions have been reported
associated with infection by non-spore-forming anaerobic
bacteria. These include a specific syndrome of bovine
necrotic  vulvovaginitis  reported  in  association  with
Porphyromonas levii in Israeli dairy herds (Elad et al.,
2004; Friedgut and Stram, 2006).

Mycoplasmas
The mycoplasmas are microorganisms in the class
Mollicutes. Of the nine genera in this class, five contain
species of veterinary interest (Fig. 38.1). The genus
Mycoplasma, in which there are more than 1o0 species,
contains most of the animal pathogens. The first
mycoplasma identified in 1890 was Mycoplasma mycoides
subspecies mycoides, the cause of contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia. Similar types of mycoplasmas which
were
subsequently
identified
were
called
pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO)
Mycoplasmas, the smallest prokaryotic cells capable of
self-replication, are pleomorphic organisms ranging from
1.0
μm long).
 Because
they
cannotsynthesize
peptidoglycan or its precursors, they do not possess rigid
cell
walls
but
have flexible,
triple-layered
outer
membranes. Their flexibility allows them to pass through
bacterial membrane filters of pore sizes from 0.22 μm to
0.45 μm. Mycoplasmas are susceptible to desiccation,
heat, detergents and disinfectants. However, they are
resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin which interfere
with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. Based on 5S
rRNA sequence analyses, the mycoplasmas have been
shown to be linked phylogenetically to Gram-positive
bacteria such as Clostridium species which have low
guanine-cytosine content in their DNA. They require
enriched media for growth, characteristically forming
1000
umbonate microcolonies when illuminated obliquely and
microcolonies with a ^fried egg? appearance in transmitted
light (Fig. 38.2). The dense central zone is due to extension
of the microcolony into the agar (Fig. 38.3). Mycoplasmas
have relatively small genomes (approximately 800 genes)
as they have lost the genes required for many metabolic
processes. They are dependent on the host cell for essential
nutrients that they cannot produce and are fastidious in
their growth requirements when cultured in vitro

grow optimally in an atmosphere of 5 to 10% CO2.
Non-pathogenic anaerobic mycoplasmas are found in the
rumens of sheep and cattle. The genera Mycoplasma and
Ureaplasma contain animal pathogens, with the latter
being associated principally with reproductive disorders.
1001
Recent changes in the classification of the mycoplasmas
have resulted in some organisms previously classified in
the rickettsial group being incorporated into the genus
Mycoplasma.
These
organisms  are
knownas the
haemotropic mycoplasmasor
 by the trivial name
haemoplasmas’ as they parasitize red blood cells. They
previously belonged to the genera Haemobartonella and
Eperythrozoon in the family Anaplasmataceae. The major
diseases associated with infection by Mycoplasma species
are summarized in Table 38.1. Other clinical conditions of
lesser economic significance are listed in Table 38.2.

Usual habitat
Mycoplasmas are found on mucosal surfaces of the
conjunctiva, nasal cavity, oropharynx and intestinal and
genital tracts of animals and humans. Some species have
tropisms for particular anatomical sites while others are
found in many locations. The haemotropic mycoplasmas
are found on the surface of red blood cells. In general, they
are host-specific although some species have a broad host
range. It is suggested that these organisms may cross the
species barrier more often than previously thought and this
may be of significance in immunocompromized or stressed
animals and humans (Pitcher and Nicholas, 2005). Many
1003
mycoplasmas are non-pathogenic and constitute part of the
normal flora of their host. Mycoplasmas survive for short
periods in the environment.
Differentiation of the mycoplasmas
colonial morphology, requirement for  cholesterol and
biochemical reactivity (Table 38.3). They can be identified
by serological methods. As biochemical and serological
confirmation of identity is difficult and these tests are
usually performed in specialized laboratories, PCR
techniques are now used as rapid, specific and relatively
easy-to-use identification tests.
·Mycoplasma species andUreaplasma species require
enriched media containing animal protein, a sterol
component and a source of DNA or adenine dinucleotide.
Commercially available mycoplasma agar or broth media
(often heart infusions) are supplemented with 20% horse
serum and yeast extract providing amino acids and vitamins.
In addition, penicillin is used to inhibit Gram-positive
bacteria, and thallous acetate is incorporated to inhibit
Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Media are buffered at pH
0 99 0 09 Hd 1e pue saioads rusnjdo54w 10g 8'2 0 27
Ureaplasma species. For culturing ureaplasmas, urea is
added to the medium and thallous acetate, which is toxic for
these organisms, is omitted.
Acholeplasmaspecies
occasionally grow as contaminants on mycoplasma media.
·Colonial morphology
 
unstained microcolonies of Mycoplasma species are 0.1 to
i ae , e aa pe  ui  go
38.2). Some species produce colonies up to 1.5 mm in
diameter which can be seen without magnification.
1004
- Colonies of Ureaplasma species are usually 0.02 to 0.06
mm in diameter and often lack a typical peripheral zone.
Because their colonies are tiny, these organisms were
formerly referred to as T- mycoplasmas.
- Dienes stain facilitates recognition of microcolonies by
staining the central zone dark blue and the peripheral zone a
lighter blue.
MicrocoloniesofMycoplasmaspecies
require
differentiation from colonies of bacterial L-forms. Because
bacterial L-forms lack a rigid cell wall, they assume shapes
resembling mycoplasmas. However, L-forms can revert to
their normal bacterial shape and produce cell walls and
typical   bacterial   colonies   when   subcultured
1on
non-inhibitory media.
·Mycoplasma species and Ureaplasma species require sterols
for growth and this is reflected in their sensitivity to
inhibition by digitonin. As Acholeplasma species are
sterol-independent, they are resistant  to inhibition by
digitonin. In the digitonin sensitivity test, a filter paper disc
impregnated with digitonin is placed on medium inoculated
with the isolate. A zone of growth inhibition exceeding 5
mm around the disc indicates sensitivity to digitonin.
· Biochemical tests are carried out in liquid or solid media
with the appropriate reagent added. Table 38.4 indicates the
biochemical reactions of the main pathogenic mycoplasmas
of sheep and goats. Unlike Ureaplasma species which
produce urease, Mycoplasma species do not metabolize urea.
· [mmunological tests, using specific antisera produced
against each pathogenic species, are used for specific
identification. Growth inhibition tests, in which filter paper
discs containing specific antisera are placed on an agar
surface seeded with the mycoplasma under test, are used for
diagnosis. A zone of growth inhibition up 8 mm wide
develops around the disc containing homologous antiserum.
Fluorescent antibody staining of individual microcolonies
can also be used for identification.

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Unlike many bacterial pathogens, mycoplasmas do not
appear to produce specific toxins or invasins. However,
some of the intrinsic metabolic functions of the organism
appear to be important in its ability to produce disease, in
addition to its ability to adhere to host cells and to evade
the immune response. Production of H2O2 can induce
toxic damage to host cells to which the organisms are
adhering. Accordingly, adhesion to host cells is an
essential attribute for pathogenicity but mycoplasmas do
1008
not invade the cells. Production of these soluble factors
may be central to the pathogenicity of some strains as it
has been shown that European strains of Mycoplasma
mycoides subsp. mycoides produce significantly less H2O2
than the more pathogenic African strains of this species
(Pilo et al., 2007). Some pathogenic species possess
structures composed of unique adhesion proteins which
promote attachment to mammalian cells (Krause and
Stevens, 1995). Mycoplasmas can adhere to neutrophils
and  macrophages and can also impair  phagocytic
functions.
Variation in surface proteins is an important virulence
attribute of Mycoplasma species as it allows the organism
to rapidly adapt to the host environment and to evade the
developing immune response. Such alterations in surface
proteins have been demonstrated in many of the important
animal pathogens including Mycoplasma mycoides subsp
mycoides (Persson et al., 2002), M. bovis (Sachse et al.,
2000) and the avian pathogens M. gallisepticum and M.
synoviae (Noormohammadi, 2007). It is not known if the
antigenic variation which occurs in these surface proteins
is a regulated event or whether it is a random response due
surface antigens. An additional mechanism which may
contribute to persistence of mycoplasmas in the host is the
similarity between some mycoplasmal antigens and host
tissue antigens. This may interfere with host recognition of
mycoplasmal antigens during tissue invasion. In addition,
it may predispose to the development of autoimmune
disease if the host's immune response to mycoplasmal
antigens  damages
 tissues which   share  antigenic
determinants with the invading pathogen.
1009
Modulation or activation of host immune responses is
critical in the pathogenesis of mycoplasmal diseases. Some
pathogenic mycoplasmas, including those involved in
pulmonary
 diseases, are mitogenic 
cforBand
TT
lymphocytes (Muhlradt and Schade, 1991). Activation of
macrophages and monocytes leads to the release of
proinflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis
factor
 and
interleukins.
 Pneumonia-producing
mycoplasmas, which
adhereto  ciliated respiratory
epithelium, can induce ciliostasis, loss of cilia and
cytopathic change.
Diagnostic procedures
Isolation of mycoplasmas from clinical samples does not
necessarily
y  confirm   aetiological  involvement  because
certain mycoplasmas of questionable clinical significance
are widely distributed. In regions where mycoplasmal
diseases are endemic, clinical findings may point to the
involvement of a particular mycoplasmal pathogen.
·Specimens for laboratory examination, ideally collected
early in the course of a disease, should be kept refrigerated
and delivered to a laboratory within 48 hours. Suitable
samples include mucosal scrapings, tracheal exudates,
aspirates, pneumonic tissue, mastitic milk and fluids from
joints or body cavities. Swabs from lesions or suspect
for trans fer to the laboratory.
· The presence of Mycoplasma species or mycoplasmal
antigens in samples can be demonstrated immunologically or
by nucleic acid procedures:
- Fluorescent antibody techniques.
1010
Peroxidase-antiperoxidase
procedures
on
 paraffin-embedded tissues.
-Polymerase chain reaction techniques.
.Theseare
particularly useful for poorly preserved samples
or for samples from animals which have been treated with
antibiotics, in which the organisms may not be viable.
· Inoculated mycoplasmal medium is incubated aerobically or
in 5 to 10% CO2, in a humid atmosphere at 37°C for up to
14 days.
· Fluid samples can be inoculated directly on to agar or into
broth media. Tissue specimens such as lung should be
freshly sampled and a cut surface moved across the surface
of a solid medium. Alternatively, the tissue can be
pasn uoisuadsns au jo saldues pue yorq u! pezjussouou
for inoculation of liquid or solid media.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
-′Fried-egg’ microcolonies
- Microcolony size
 Cholesterol requirement for growth (digitonin sensitivity
test)
- Biochemical profile including urease production
- Fluorescent antibody technique on microcolonies
- Growth inhibition test with specific antisera.
· Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Disc diffusion methods
are not suitable for testing mycoplasmal organisms because
Of their slow-growing nature, and thus micro broth dilution
methods are most commonly used. However, for
mycoplasma organisms which grow on solid media, the E
test method is an easily performed, satisfactory method.
·Serological tests:
1011
- Complement fixation tests for the major mycoplasmal
diseases of ruminants are used for certification when animals
 are traded internationally.
-TestsbasedonELISA are being developedfor the
diagnosis of economically important mycoplasmal diseases.
A competitive ELISA for Mycoplasma mycoides subsp.

- Rapid plate agglutination tests are used for screening
poultry flocks and for the field diagnosis of contagious
bovine pleuropneumonia.
Haemagglutination-inhibition   tests  can  be  used   to
diseases.
Clinical infections
Mycoplasmas are often implicated in disease processes
involving mucosal surfaces and such disease frequently
becomes chronic. Factors such as extremes of age, stress
and intercurrent infection may predispose to tissue
invasion.  In addition, mycoplasmas may exacerbate
disease initiated by other pathogens, particularly in the
respiratory tract.
Mycoplasmal  infections  cause  respiratory diseases  of
major economic importance in farm animals, especially in
ruminants, pigs and poultry (Table 38.1). Infections
associated with mastitis or conjunctivitis in cattle and with
disease conditions in pets are usually of lesser importance
(Table 38.2). Several mycoplasmas have been isolated
       
1012
respiratory and urinary tract disease in dogs (Jang et al.,
1984). Mycoplasma cynos is commonly associated with
respiratory disease in dogs, and experimental infection
resulted in pneumonia (Chalker, 2005). In cats, M. felis can
cause conjunctivitis and M. gateae is associated with
arthritis.
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a severe
contagious disease of cattle which has been recognized for
more than 2o0 years and formerly had a worldwide
distribution. It is caused by M. mycoides subsp. mycoides
(small colony type), a member of the ‘mycoides
cluster'.This cluster is composed of five closely related
members including the M. mycoides and M. capricolum
subspecies of sheep and goats (Table 38.1) and M. leachii
(Table 38.2). Members of the cluster share biochemical,
immunological and genetic characteristics which render
differentiation of  individual
1species  and  subspecies
difficult (Egwu et al., 1996).
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia is endemic in central
Africa,the Middle Eastand Asia.Sporadic outbreaks,
usually of a less severe form of the disease, have recently
occurred in Portugal, France, Italy and Spain. Recent
genotyping of strains from Europe and Africa, using
multilocus sequence analysis, has confirmed that the
strains from both continents are different and that
European strains did not originate in Africa (Yaya et al.,
2008). The main method of transmission is by aerosols.
Transmission of the disease requires close contact with
clinically affected animals or asymptomatic carriers.
1013
Clinical signs become apparent 3 weeks after infection.
The severity of the disease relates to strain virulence and
the immune status of the host. Spread of infection can be
relatively slow with peak morbidity (about 50%) at 7 to 8
months after introduction of infection into a herd. In severe
outbreaks, the mortality rate may be high.
Clinical signs and pathology
Clinical signs in the acute form of CBPP include sudden
onset of high fever, anorexia, depression, drop
in milk yield, accelerated respiration and coughing
Animals adopt a characteristic stance with the head and
neck extended and elbows abducted. Expiratory grunting
can occur 1 to 3 weeks after the onset of clinical signs.
Arthritis, synovitis and endocarditis may be present in
affected calves.
At post-mortem, the pneumonic lungs have a marbled
appearance. Grey and red consolidated lobules alternate
irregularly with pink emphysematous lobules and the
interlobular septa are distended and oedematous. There
may be abundant serofibrinous exudate in the pleural
cavity. In chronic cases, fibrous encapsulation of necrotic
foci is commonly found. These necrotic foci contain viable
mycoplasmas, and breakdown of the capsules in
chronically affected animals is a major factor in the
persistence and spread of CBPP in endemic areas.
Diagnosis
1014
· In endemic regions, clinical signs and characteristic post
mortem findings allow a presumptive diagnosis.
· The fluorescent antibody test can be used on pleural fluid to
confirm the presence of the pathogen.
· Isolation and definitive identification of the pathogen from
broncho-alveolar lavage, pleural fluid, lung tissue or the
broncho-pulmonary lymph nodes is confirmatory.
·Polymerase chain reaction based tests may be useful
confirmatory tests. The successful development of real-time
PCR assays for the differentiation of members of the
'mycoides cluster” has been reported recently (Fitzmaurice
et af., 2008 ).
·Serological tests:
- Rapid field serum agglutination test
- Passive haemagglutination screening test
-Complement fixation test or competitive ELISA for
determining disease status of animals crossing national
boundaries
-Dot-blot technique for confirmation (Nicholas et af.,
1996).
Treatment and control
 Treatment with antimicrobial drugs is prohibited in countries
where the disease is exotic but is often attempted in
unsatisfactory, especially for chronically affected animals,
but has been reported as effective in reducing transmission
of infection to healthy in-contact animals where all affected
cattle are treated (Hubschle et af., 2004).
 In countries where CBPP is exotic, slaughter of affected and
in-contact cattle is mandatory.
·In endemic regions, control strategies are based on
prohibiting movement of suspect animals, mandatory
1015
quarantine and the elimination of carrier animals by
serological testing and slaughter.
 Annual vaccination with attenuated vaccines is carried out to
stimulate effective immunity in cattle in endemic areas. The
virulence of attenuated vaccines varies with the strain of
mycoplasma employed. Annualvaccinationmay be
discontinued as eradication of the disease progresses.
Infections with Mycoplasma bovis
Strains of M. bovis, which is worldwide in distribution, can
cause severe pneumonia in calves in the absence of other
respiratory pathogens (Doherty et al., 1994) and can
exacerbate respiratory disease caused by Pasteurella and
Mannheimia species (Gourlay et al., 1989). Mycoplasma
bovis is frequently associated with chronic respiratory
disease. There is good evidence that the organism plays a
causal  role
1n
the
lesions
of
caseonecrotic
bronchopneumonia
frequently
observed
1 in  natural
outbreaks of M. bovis infection and disease (Caswell and
Archambault, 2007). It is suggested that the lesions
observed in experimental infections are milder because
animals are usually slaughtered within 2 weeks of
infection. Mycoplasma bovis has also been associated with
mastitis and polyarthritis. Arthritis usually occurs in
association with respiratory disease or mastitis. Diagnostic
techniques
are
similar
to
those used  for other
mycoplasmas. Treatment and control of respiratory disease
are based on management practices and antimicrobial
therapy although response to treatment is frequently poor
in chronic cases. Although two inactivated vaccines are
available in the USA as an aid in the prevention of
respiratory disease, their efficacy is questionable. Mastitis
caused by M. bovis may range from subclinical to severe
1016
and systemic involvement with arthritis may occur. A
number of other  Mycoplasma  species  cause  sporadic
mastitis in cattle (Table 38.2). There is often a dramatic
loss of milk production and the serous or purulent mastitic
exudate has a high leukocyte count. Mycoplasmal mastitis
should be considered when other common bacterial causal
agents have  been  excluded.  Mastitis   caused by
Mycoplasma bovis is discussed in more detail in Chapter
93.
Contagious agalactia of sheep and goats
This severe febrile disease of sheep and goats, caused by
M. agalactiae, is prevalent in parts of Europe, northern
Africa and parts of Asia. It usually becomes
evident immediately after parturition and is characterized
by mastitis, arthritis and conjunctivitis. Pregnant animals
may abort and the disease can be fatal in young animals
due to pneumonic complications. The organism is shed in
milk and may remain localized in the supramammary
lymph nodes between lactations. Disease due to M.
agalactiae must be distinguished from mastitis and
arthritis associated with M. capricolum subsp. capricolum
or M. mycoides subsp. capri (Gil et al., 1999). Inactivated
and    attenuated
vaccines
forM.
agalactiae are
commercially available.
Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia
Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP), caused by
M.
capricolumsubsp.
capripneumoniae(formerly
Mycoplasma strain F38), is present in northern and eastermn
Africa and in Turkey. The disease is characterized by
1017
pneumonia, fibrinous pleurisy, profuse pleural exudate and
a marbled appearance on the cut surface of affected lungs.
Although similar in many respects to contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia (CBPP), well developed necrotic areas in
the lungs in chronic CCPP are rare. The disease is highly
contagious and is transmitted by aerosols. Nomadic herds
often carry infection to regions free of the disease.
Pleuropneumonia in goats can occasionally be caused by
V.
f.mycoides subspecies capri. However, monoclonal
antibody to M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae is
specific for this organism in a growth inhibition disc test
(Belton et al., 1994). More recent tests based on PCR are
rapid and specific and are now widely used for
identification of isolates andfor direct detection of the
organism in clinical specimens (Anon., 2008b). Inactivated
vaccines give satisfactory protection
Enzootic pneumonia of pigs
This economically important disease, caused by M.
hyopneumoniae, occurs worldwide in intensively reared
pigs. Poor ventilation, overcrowding and temperature
fluctuations may precipitate an outbreak. Pigs of all ages
are susceptible and the condition is characterized by
coughing, poor growth rates and, in some cases,
respiratory   distress.
At
t post-mortem,  pulmonary
consolidation is confined to the cranial and middle lobes
with clear demarcation from normal lung tissue. Clinical,
epidemiological  and  pathological  findings  are   usually
indicative of the presence of the condition. The gold
standard for confirmation of disease is by isolation and
identification of the pathogen. However, the organism is
extremely difficult to isolate.AlthoughM.hyopneumoniae
1018
can be demonstrated　inlung　t
tissue  by
immunofluorescence, PCR-based tests are now regarded as
the most sensitive tests available. Infection on a herd basis
may be demonstrated serologically, usually by ELISA.
Appropriate antimicrobial drugs such as tylosin tartrate,
lincomycin or tiamulin, when incorporated into the feed,
are suitable for controlling herd infections. However,
antimicrobial resistance to a number of agents has been
reported, including
resistance
eto tylosinand
1 to
fluoroquinolones (Vicca et al., 2004, 2007). Inactivated
and subunit vaccines are available and are useful for
reducing the development of  clinical disease and
production losses but they do not prevent infection.
  s     
development of specific-pathogen-free herds.
Other mycoplasmal diseases of pigs
Mycoplasmahyorhiniscauses achronic progressive
polyserositis in pigs up to10weeks of age. It is
characterized by fever, laboured breathing, lameness and
swollen joints. At post-mortem, serofibrinous pleurisy,
pericarditis and peritonitis are present. The disease can be
confirmed by isolation and identification of the pathogen
and by serology. Tylosin or lincomycin, administered early
in the course of the disease, may be of therapeutic value.
A polyarthritis caused by M. hyosynoviae affects pigs from
10 to 30 weeks of age. This self-limiting arthritis and
synovitis produce transient lameness. Confirmation relies
on isolation and identification of the pathogen.
Mycoplasmal diseases of poultry
1019
Mycoplasma gallisepticum causes chronic respiratory
disease in chickens and infectious sinusitis in turkeys. The
organism is transmitted through infection of the embryo in
the egg or by aerosols. Clinical signs are consistent with
upper respiratory tract involvement in chickens. In turkeys.
there is swelling of the paranasal sinuses. Reduced egg
production may be evident. Diagnosis is based on isolation
and identification of the pathogen and on flock testing
using
the serum
1plate a
agglutinationtest.Several
PCR-based methods for the detection of the organism in
clinical samples and for identification of isolates have been
published (Anon., 2008c). Haemagglutination inhibition
and ELISA tests are also used in flocks to confirm
infection. Although antimicrobial medication of feed is
used
1during
outbreaks,  the
establishmentof
specific-pathogen-free flocks is the preferred method for
controlling the disease. Eggs used for hatching should be
dipped in a tylosin solution to eliminate the pathogen
Modified live vaccines and bacterins are available.
Mycoplasma meleagridis may be egg-transmitted and may
be present in turkey semen. Aerosol transmission
is less important with this pathogen than with M.
gallisepticum. The clinical features of the infection include
reduced egg hatchability, airsacculitis in young poults and
joint and bone deformities in growers. Confirmation
requires isolation and identification of the pathogen. The
serum plate agglutination test is used for flock testing.
Tylosin, administered in the water for the first 10 days of
life, is of therapeutic value. Eggs used for hatching should
be dipped in tylosin solution. Semen should be obtained
from M.meleagridis-free toms.
1020
Mycoplasma synoviae, the cause of infectious synovitis in
chickens and turkeys, is transmitted mainly by aerosols
       s 
gallisepticum and M. meleagridis infections. Synovitis,
arthritis and respiratory signs are the main clinical features.
Confirmation requires isolation and identification of the
pathogen or positive serological tests. In common with
other mycoplasmas, PCR-based detection methods are
available. Tetracycline medication of the feed is used for
treatment and control. Eradication is possible through the
development of specific-pathogen-free flocks.
Haemotropic mycoplasmas
These organisms, which were formerly classified within
the rickettsial group, are small bacteria that cannot be
cultured in vitro. They were reclassified as mycoplasmas
based   on biological
 and   phenotypic  characteristics
including their small size, lack of a cell wall and resistance
to penicillin. Sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA
gene confirmed the relationship of the species
Haemobartonella and Eperythrozoon withmycoplasmas
(Messick, 2004)
Feline infectious anaemia
Feline infectious anaemia, which is caused by Mycoplasma
haemofelis, occurs worldwide. The pathogen is found on
the surface  of erythrocytes  (Fig. 38.4).
Twoother
haemotropic mycoplasmas (Candidatus M. haemominutum
and Candidatus M. huricensis) have been detected in cats,
but they are seldom associated with clinical disease (Willi
et al., 2007a). The exact mode of transmission is uncertain.
1021
However, the disease is comparatively
commonin
free-roaming tom cats between 1 and 3 years of age and
transmission through bite-wounds or by biting arthropods
has been suggested. Perinatal transmission to kittens has
been recorded. Recovered cats may remain asymptomatic
carriers. The prevalence of carrier cats in a population may
approach 15% for M. haemofelis and may be as high as
38% for Candidatus M. haemominutum (Willi et al.,
2007a).

Mycoplasma
haemofelis.When
 stained
with
Romanowsky stain, the organisms (arrows) appear as dark
cocci or rods which are located on the surfaces of red
blood cells.
Pathogenesis and clinical signs
The clinical presentation of the disease is variable and the
mechanisms for production of anaemia and haemolysis are
not completely understood. The attachment of the
1022
organism to the red blood cells may lead to direct damage.
In addition, cold agglutinins have been observed in cats
infected with M.
haemofelis  which suggests the
involvementof immunological
 mechanisms in   the
destruction of red cells. In peracute disease, a profound
anaemia  associated  with  immunosuppression  and   an
overwhelming parasitaemia rapidly results in death. The
more commonly encountered acute form of the disease
presents with fever, anaemia, depression, weakness and,
occasionally, jaundice. A chronic form of the disease may
follow, with affected animals exhibiting anaemia, lethargy
and marked weight loss. In immunocompetent cats,
successive waves of parasitaemia are gradually eliminated
and a satisfactory regenerative bone marrow response
develops.  Immunosuppression resulting  from infection
with feline retroviruses is often a major factor in the
development of severe feline infectious anaemia
Diagnosis
Mycoplasma haemofelis may be demonstrated on the surface
of erythrocytes in Giemsa-stained blood smears (Fig. 38.4).
Because of the cyclical nature of the parasitaemia, daily
blood sampling may be necessary and the sensitivity of this
technique is low, less than 20%
·PCR analysis is the best method currently available for
diagnosis of infection with haemotropic mycoplasmas.
Several methods have been published
including a real-time PCR technique which can differentiate
infect cats (Tasker et af., 2003; Willi et af, 2007b).
·The pathogen can be demonstrated in blood smears by
immunofluorescence.
-Haematological findings may include a reduced packed cell
volume and evidence of regenerative anaemia.
1023
·Babesia felis and Cytauxzoonfelis should be considered in
the differential diagnosis.
Treatment and control
·In acute disease, doxycycline therapy initiated early and
continued for up to 2l days is effective for treatment of
clinical signs but may not eliminate infection.
·Severely affected cats may require blood transfusions.
· Control measures should include flea control and the careful
selection of feline donors for blood transfusion.

Infection with Mycoplasma suis
Mycoplasma suis infection in pigs is one of the most
common haemotropic mycoplasma infections of farm
animals. Most infections are subclinical and the prevalence
in some pig herds can approach 20%. Transmission
involves biting arthropods such as lice. It may also result
from the use of instruments contaminated with infected
blood. Outbreaks of disease are sporadic and may be
associated with stress factors.S

Chlamydia and Chlamydophila species
Members of the order Chlamydialesare obligate
intracellular bacteria with an unusual developmental cycle
during which unique infectious forms are produced. They
eukaryotic host cells. The order Chlamydiales consists of
four  families,  Chlamydiaceae,
Parachlamy-diaceae,
SimkaniaceaeandWaddliaceae.Waddliachon-drophild
and Parachlamydia species
S have been implicated in
bovine abortion (Ruhl et al., 2009), whileNeochlamydia
hartmannellae, an amoebic endosymbiont, has been
associated with ocular disease in cats (von Bomhard et al.,
2003). However, by far the most significant species from a
veterinary and medical point of view are found in the
family Chlamydiaceae. On account of their apparent
difficulty with generating ATP and resultant dependence
on host cell metabolism, chlamydiae have been termed
'energy parasites'. Currently, two genera, Chlamydia and
Chlamydophila. and nine species are described (Fig. 39.1).
Formerly a single genus and four species, Chlamydia
trachomatis, C. psittaci, C. pneumoniae and C. pecorum,
were recognized. This classification was based
1on
phenotypic characteristics such as host preference,
inclusion morphology, iodine staining for the presence of
glycogen, and sulphonamide susceptibility. However,
nucleic acid sequencing studies of the 16S and 23S rRNA
genes indicate two distinct lineages (Everett et al., 1999).
Recently, it has been proposed to include all nine species
in a single genus, Chlamydia species (Greub, 2010a, b).
1031
In the developmental cycle of chlamydiae, infectious and
reproductive forms are morphologically distinct (Fig
39.2). Infectious extracellular forms, called elementary
bodies (EBs) are small (200 to 300 nm), metabolically
inert and osmotically stable. Each EB is surrounded by a
conventional
bacterial
cytoplasmic
membrane,a
periplasmic space and an outer envelope containing
lipopolysaccharide.  The periplasmic  space does not
contain a detectable peptidoglycan layer and the EB relies
on disulphide cross-linked envelope proteins for osmotic
stability (Hatch, 1996). Elementary bodies enter host cells
by  receptor-mediated  endocytosis  Acidification  of the
endosome and fusion with lysosomes are prevented by
mechanisms which are not fully understood. A process of
structural reorganization within the pathogen, of several
hours’ duration, results in the conversion of an EB into a
reticulate body (RB). The RB, about 1 μm in diameter, is
metabolically active and osmotically fragile and replicates
by binary fission within the vacuole. The vacuole and its
contents, when stained, are called an inclusion. When a
number of inclusions containing RBs of C. trachomatis are
formed in an infected cell, fusion of these structures may
occur. About 20 hours after infection, the developmental
cycle becomes asynchronous, with some RBs continuing
to divide and remaining in close association with the
inclusion membrane while others detach from the inclusion
membrane, condense and mature to form EBs. In general,
replication continues for up to 72 hours after infection
when the host cell lyses releasing several hundred bodies
which  include  EBs,  RBs and  intermediate forms.
Chlamydial replication may be delayed in the presence of
gamma interferon or penicillin or when the availability of
tryptophan
orcysteine is limited, resulting in
1032
morphologically aberrant forms and persistent infection.
Delayed replication of this type appears to be important in
the development of the immunopathological changes in
humans associated with
1trachoma and with pelvic
inflammatory reactions.

The gastrointestinal tract appears to be the usual site of
Chlamydophila species  infection  in animals.  Intestinal
infections are often subclinical and persistent.  Faecal
shedding of the organisms, which is typically prolonged,
becomes intermittent with time. The EBs can survive in
the environment for several days.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Chlamydiae infect over 450 species of birds and a large
number of mammalian species including humans. In recent
years, isolations have also been made from invertebrate
species. Chlamydial species are usually associated with
specific   diseases
 in particular
hosts. In  sheep,
Chlamydophila abortus is an important cause of abortion
whereas infections with C. pecorum are frequently
1034
it occurs, the outcome of infection in the secondary host
may be either similar, as in transmission from sheep to
cattle, or severe, as in transmission from sheep to pregnant
women.
Infection  with   C.  pecorum   is  associated
Iwith
conjunctivitis, arthritis and inapparent intestinal infection.
The type of clinical presentation relates to the route of
infection and the degree of exposure. Environmental
factors and management practices can influence the
prevalence of some chlamydial infections such as enzootic
abortion in ewes, which tend to be more prevalent in
intensively managed lowland flocks.
Many chlamydial infections are asymptomatic, particularly
when they are localized in superficial epithelia They may
also persist for long periods without inducing protective
immunity. However, chronic infections may repeatedly
stimulate the host immune system. Chlamydiae possess a
number of heat shock proteins which are partially
homologous to heat shock proteins in other bacteria and to
a number of human mitochondrial proteins. It is considered
that repeated stimulation of the immune system with these
proteins  contributes  significantly  to  the delayed-type
hypersensitivity responses associated with trachoma and
inflammatory pelvic disease in humans. The tissue damage
in these diseases is more severe than would be expected
from direct infection alone. Gamma interferon has been
shown to contribute to the control of primary chlamydial
infections. However, there is also evidence that gamma
interferon  can induce latent or persistent chlamydial
1035
infections which, in turn, may be responsible for increased
heat shock protein expression (Ward, 1995).

Diagnostic procedures
Consideration   of
fthe history,
clinical
signs
and
pathological   changes  may   suggest  certain   chlamydial
infections such as feline chlamydiosis and enzootic
abortion of ewes. Based on history and clinical findings,
1036
chlamydial involvement in a disease outbreak may be
suspected but laboratory confirmation is required for a
reliable diagnosis. A review of recent developments in the
laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infections has been
published (Sachse et al., 2009)
· Specimens for isolation of the organism should be placed in
suitable
transport
medium
such
as
with foetal calf serum, aminoglycoside antibiotics and an
antifungal agent (Spencer and Johnson, 1983). As
chlamydiae are thermolabile, samples should be kept at 4°C.
For long-term storage, samples should be frozen at -70°C.
However, each cycle of freezing and thawing reduces the
titre of the stored organisms.
organisms in smears or tissue sections containing moderate
numbers of organisms. Smears or histo-logical sections of
Organs from aborted foetuses or from the liver and spleen in
cases of avian chlamydiosis are suitable for direct
examination. Placental smears from cases of chlamydial
abortion typically contain large numbers of organisms.
Suitable chemical staining procedures include the modified
Ziehl-Neelsen, Giemsa,
modified  Machiavello and
Castaneda methods. Methylene blue-stained smears can be
examined by dark-field  microscopy.  Immunofluorescent
staining improves the sensitivity of detection of chlamydial
EBs in smears but usually does not identify the species
involved because the monoclonal antibodies commonly used
are directed against Chlamydiaceae- specific antigens such
as chlamydial LPS
·Several commercial kit sets employing ELISA methodology
have been developed for the detection of C. trachomatis.
Many of these kit sets detect chlamydial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) which is common to allChiamydia and
Chlamydophila species. Consequently, they can be used to
detect the LPS of species in both genera.
1037
· Chlamydiae can be isolated either in embryonated eggs,
following inoculation into the yolk sac, or in a number of
continuous cell lines such as McCoy, L929, baby hamster
kidney and Vero. Cell lines vary in their susceptibility to
infection by different chlamydial species. For ease of fixing
and subsequent staining, tissue culture cells are usually
grown in flat-bottomed vials containing coverslips. The
attachment of chlamydiae to cells is greatly enhanced by
centrifugationof the sample ontothe monolayer.The
sensitivity of the isolation procedure is also increased by the
use of non-replicating cells. This is achieved by the addition
of
cytotoxic
chemicals
such
1ascycloheximide,
5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine, cytochalasin B and emetine to the
cell culture medium. After 2 to 3 days’ incubation at 37°C
the monolayer is fixed, stained as described above and
examined  for the presence of chlamydial  inclusions.
Antibiotics to which chlamydiae are sensitive, such as
oxytetracycline, erythromycin and penicillin, should not be
used in the cell culture medium.
·Polymerase chain reaction techniques have been developed
for the detection of chlamydial DNA in samples. The
primers are typically directed against the ribosomal RNA
operon or the ompA gene. Using these methods it is possible
to distinguish different chlamydial species by employing
specific primers (Sheehy et al., 1996; Everett and Andersen,
1999; Sachse and Hotzel, 2003 ). Real-time protocols and a
DNA microarray assay are also available for both detection
and species identification (DeGraves et af., 2003 ; Ehricht et
af., 2006).
·Several serological procedures available for the detection of
antibodies  to chlamydiae  include complement fixation,
ELISA,
indirect
immunofluorescence
and
micro-immunofluorescence. Although
the complement
fixation test is the most widely recognized serological test, it
is time-consuming and only moderately sensitive. More
sensitive assays based on ELISA methodology are now
available. Because chlamydial infection is widespread, an
exceptionally high or a rising antibody titre must be

many of the available serological procedures detect
       
allow differentiation of the chlamydial species involved in
the infection. In addition, there is cross-reactivity between
the LPS of chlamydiae and that of some other Gramnegative
bacteria.
Clinical infections
A wide range of animal species are susceptible to
infections with chlamydiae (Vanrompay et al., 1995 ).
Both the severity and the type of disease produced by
chlamydiae are highly variable, ranging from clinically
inapparent  infections and local  infections of epithelial
surfaces to severe systemic infections (Table 39.1).
Diseases associated  with chlamydial infections  include
conjunctivitis, arthritis, abortion, urethritis, enteritis,
pneumonia and encephalomyelitis. Clinical signs and their
severity are influenced by factors related to both host and
pathogen, and one type of clinical presentation usually
predominates in outbreaks of disease.

The species of Chlamydophila that infect humans differ in
transmissibility.   Although
 human  infections 
can
be
acquired following contact with aborting ewes or cats with
1040
conjunctivitis, infected birds are considered to be more
likely sources of infection. Human infections acquired
from psittacine species are termed psittacosis while those
from other avian species are termed ornithosis. Irrespective
of the avian source of the infection, the condition typically
presents as a respiratory illness.
Enzootic abortion of ewes
Enzootic abortion of ewes (EAE) caused by C. abortus is
primarily a disease of intensively managed flocks. The
disease is economically significant in most sheepproducing
countries.Although abortion associated with C. abortus is
best documented in sheep, it has also been reported in
other domestic species including cattle, pigs and goats.
Chlamydial infection in cattle and goats often originates
from sheep. The source of
infection in pigs is less clearly defined (Schiller et al.,
1997).
Epidemiology
Infection is usually introduced into clean flocks wher
infected replacement ewes abort. Large numbers of
from affected ewes. Organisms can remain viable in the
environment for several days at low  temperatures.
Infection occurs by ingestion. The role of infected rams in
venereal spread is uncertain (Appleyard et al., 1985). Ewes
infected late in pregnancy do not usually abort but may do
 a  a  d xa   o
result in abortion during that pregnancy. Ewe lambs may
acquire infection during the neonatal period and abort
1041
during their first pregnancy. As a result, the most dramatic
outbreaks of EAE often occur in the year following the
introduction of infection into a flock.
Pathogenesis
The site of persistence in non-pregnant ewes is unknown.
The first signs of chlamydial infection of the placenta are
detectable at about day 90 of gestation. The organism
targets the trophoblast layer giving rise to inflammation,
thrombotic vasculitis and tissue necrosis in the placenta.
Dissemination to foetal tissues occurs but the pathological
changes are mild. Abortion is considered to result from a
combination of factors including reduced efficiency of
foetal-matermal  exchange,  disruption  of  placental
endocrine function and disruption of the immunological
balance (‘immune expulsion') between foetus and dam
(Sammin et al., 2009 ).
Clinical signs
Enzootic abortion of ewes is characterized by abortion
during late pregnancy or by the birth of premature weak
lambs. Aborted lambs are well developed and fresh.
Necrosis  of
 cotyledons  and oedema  of   adjacent
intercotyledonary tissue in affected placentae is often
present along with a dirty pink uterine exudate. Aborting
ewes rarely show evidence of clinical disease and their
 dn qnoua pandn Ansn si  rnbasns
30% of animals in a fully susceptible flock may abort, a
            
disease is endemic.
1042
Diagnosis
Well-preserved aborted lambs and evidence of necrotic
placentitis are suggestive of EAE.
Large numbers of EBs can be demonstrated in placental
smears using suitable staining procedures. If using MZN
staining, care must be taken to avoid confusing chlamydial
EBs with Coxieffaburnetii which also causes abortionin
ruminants and has similar staining properties.
·Commercial diagnostic kits are available for the detection of
chlamydial antigen in samples.
· Isolation of chlamydiae in suitable cell lines or in the yolk
sac of embryonated eggs is possible.
Polymerase chain reaction techniques are available and can
C. abortus and C. pecorum (Sachse and Hotzel, 2003). A
real-time PCR protocol for C. abortus is available (Pantchev
et af., 2009).
·A number of different serological tests can be used for the
detection of chlamydial antibodies including the complement
fixation test, ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence.
Chlamydophila abortus shares some common antigens with
C. pecorum and a number of Gram-negative bacteria. The
use of recombinant antigens specific for C. abortus may
improve the specificity of serological tests (Rodolakis et al.
1998; Wilson et al, 2009). The serological tests currently
available do not distinguish between vaccinated and infected
animals.
Treatment and control
Control measures for EAE have been comprehensively
reviewed (Aitken et al., 1990 ).
Chlamydiae are susceptible to a number of antibiotics which
can  be used during  an outbreak.  Administration  of
long-acting oxytetracycline to in-contact pregnant ewes has
beenshowntoincreasethenumberof live-bornlambs.
1043
However, antibiotic treatment does not eliminate the
infection and treated ewes may shed chlamydiae at
parturition.
Transmission of infection in anaffected flock can be
reduced by isolating all aborted ewes for 2 to 3 weeks,
removing and destroying all placentas, thoroughly cleaning
areas  where  abortions  occurred   and  administering
lambed.
·A decision should be made either to vaccinate or attempt to
eradicate the disease by culling. A live attenuated vaccine,
containing   a   chemically  induced   temperature-sensitive
mutant strain, is available and must be administered to ewes
which can be used in pregnant animals. The abortion rate
and level of shedding of the organism is significantly
reduced in vaccinated animals.
·Chlamydophila abortus infection is serious and potentially
life-threatening for pregnant women who should avoid
contact with ewes during the lambing season (Johnson et al.,
1985; Buxton, 1986).
Feline chlamydiosis
Chlamydophila felis (formerly known as feline strains of
C. psittaci) is associated with conjunctivitis and, less
commonly, rhinitis. Feline pneumonitis, the original name
for feline chlamydiosis, is now considered a misnomer
because of the rarity of lower respiratory tract infection
caused by C. felis in cats.
Epidemiology
Serological surveys have revealed that about 1o% of
unvaccinated cats have antibodies to C. felis. The primary
target is the conjunctiva and C. felis can be isolated from
1044
up to 30% of cats with conjunctivitis, particularly cats with
chronic conjunctivitis (Wills et al., 1988). Infection is
transmitted by direct or indirect contact with conjunctival
or nasal secretions. Organisms may also be shed from the
reproductive tract (TerWee et al., 1998). Infection may be
persistent  with prolonged shedding of organisms and
clinical relapses. The infection is most common in
multi-cat households, particularly breeding catteries. The
stress of parturition and lactation may trigger shedding of
 sss  s  q s
their offspring. The majority of cases occur in cats less
than l year of age.
Clinical signs
After an incubation period of about 5 days, unilateral or
bilateral conjunctival congestion, clear ocular discharge,
chemosis and blepharospasm become evident. If secondary
infection with organisms such as Mycoplasma felis and
Staphylococcus species occurs, the ocular discharge may
become
 mucopurulent.
Conjunctivitis  may
be
accompanied by  sneezing and nasal discharge. The
condition usually resolves without treatment in a few
weeks. However, persistent infection with recurring
clinical episodes also occurs.
Diagnosis
· The specimen of choice for detection of the organism is a
conjunctival swab containing a large number of cells.
· Stained conjunctival smears may reveal intracyto-plasmic
inclusions.
·The organism may be isolated in suitable cell lines or in
embryonatedeggs.
1045
·Commercial diagnostic ELISA kits for detecting the
family-specific lipopolysaccharide antigen are available.
· Conventional and real time polymerase chain reaction
protocols have been developed for samples and are
considered the methods of choice (von Bomhard et al., 2003;
Dean et al, 2005).
·The  complement
tfixation test, ELISA or indirect
immunofluorescence test can be used to detect chlamydial
antibody titres. Serology is useful  for establishing if
infection is endemic in a group of cats.
Treatment and control
·Chlamydiae are susceptible to several antibiotics, and
systemic treatment is more effective than local treatment.
Tetracyclines are generally considered the antibiotics of
choice. To avoid relapses, treatment should continue for 2
weeks after the resolution of clinical signs. All in-contact
cats should be treated at the same time.
Both inactivated and modified live vaccines are available for
parenteral inoculation. Vaccination reduces the clinical
effects of natural infection but does not prevent infection or
the  shedding  of  organisms. Inadvertent
tintraocular
administration of the live vaccine can result in conjunctivitis
(Sturgess et al., 1995 ).
·A small number of cases of conjunctivitis in humans
involving C. felis have been reported.
Sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis
This neurological disease, caused by C. pecorum, has been
described in several regions of the world including the
USA, Japan, Israel and Europe. Although intestinal
infection in cattle with C. pecorum is considered to be
common,  sporadic  bovine  encephalomyelitis
occurs
haphazardly and the predisposing factors are unknown.
Affected animals, which are usually under 3 years of age,
1046
develop a high  fever and exhibit incoordination,
depression, excessive salivation and diarrhoea. Terminally.
animals may become recumbent and can develop
opisthotonos. The course of the disease is about 2 weeks
and the mortality rate may be up to 50%. Lesions
associated with vascular damage are found in the brain and
other organs. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, the
presence of a serofibrinous peritonitis, histopathological
changes in the brain and isolation or detection of the
organism in brain tissue. High doses of antibiotics such as
tetracyclines and
tylosin may be effective. Vaccines are not available and a
control strategy has not been formulated.
Avian chlamydiosis
Infections with  C. psittaci in psittacine birds were
originally designated psittacosis, and ornithosis 
was
reserved for chlamydial infection in other avian species.
Avian chlamydiosis is currently the preferred designation
for the condition. The disease has been recorded
worldwide with the highest infection rates reported in
psittacine
birds
(Psittacidae)
and
pigeons
(Columbiformes).
Based on immunofluorescent reactions with a panel of
monoclonal  antibodies  against  major  outer  membrane
protein (MOMP) epitopes, six avian serotypes of C.
psittaci designated A to F are recognized (Andersen, 1991,
1997). The syndromes and host ranges of particular
serotype A, psittacine birds; serotype B, pigeons; serotype
C, ducks and geese; serotype D, turkeys; serotype E,
1047
pigeons and ratites; serotype F, parakeets. Based on
PCR-RFLP data, serotypes have been assigned to
equivalent genotypes (Vanrompay et al, 1997'. A further
three genotypes are generally accepted, namely genotype
E/B, a group of isolates from ducks, turkeys and pigeons
(Geens et al., 2005 ); and two mammalian isolates, WC in
cattle and M56 in muskrats. Sequence analysis of the
ompA gene, which codes for MOMP, has revealed a
further six genotypes of C. psittaci (Sachse et al., 2008 ).
Epidemiology
A wide range of both wild and domestic avian species are
susceptible to infection. The organism is present in
respiratory discharges and faeces of infected birds.
Infection is usually acquired by inhalation or by ingestion.
Subclinical infection is common. Clinically affected and
carrier birds may shed organisms intermittently  for
prolonged    periods.   Stress   arising
fromcaptivity,
transportation, egg-laying, overcrowding and intercurrent
     r 
shedding and disease outbreaks.
Clinical signs
Avian chlamydiosis is a generalized infection, affecting
particularly  the  digestive and respiratory  tracts. The
incubation period is up to 10 days. Clinical signs vary in
nature and severity, depending on the strain of C. psittaci
and the species and age of the affected birds. Signs include
loss of condition, nasal and ocular discharges, diarrhoea
and respiratory distress. The most frequent post-mortem
1048
findings  are  hepatosplenomegaly,  a
airsacculitis   and
peritonitis.
Diagnosis
The diagnostic techniques for avian chlamydiosis have
been reviewed by Andersen (2008).
·Organisms may be identified in stained impression smears of
affected tissues.
· Chlamydial
 antigen
may
be
detected
using
immunohistochemistry or ELISA kits.
Chlamydial DNA may be demonstrated by the polymerase
chain reaction (Van Loock et af., 2005 ; Laroucau et af.,
2007). Real-time PCR protocols and a genotyping
microarray for C. psittaci are available (Geens et al., 2005 ;
Sachse et al., 2008 ).
·Isolation of C. psittaci is carried out in cell culture Oor
embryonated eggs.
·Antibodies to C. psittaci may be detected using suitable
serological tests including the complement fixation test and
ELISA. However, interpretation of antibody titres can be
difficult, particularly when single samples are tested. Results
based on paired serum samples or samples from several
birds in a flock are more reliable for diagnosis than a single
serum sample.
Treatment and control
·Tetracyclines are the antibiotics of choice. An extended
course of treatment over several weeks is required.
A commercial vaccine is not available.
 [mported birds, particularly psittacine species, should be
held in quarantine and receive tetracycline-medicated feeds.
· Proper husbandry and suitable transportation minimize the
occurrence of clinical disease.
1049
 Avian chlamydial isolates are potentially zoonotic. Infection,
which commonly follows aerosol inhalation, may be
subclinical or result in systemic disease. Pulmonary
involvement is common. Meningitis or meningoencephalitis
may develop in severely affected individuals. Psittacosis in
humans is a notifiable disease in the USA, Japan, Australia
and many European countries.

Rickettsiales and Coxiella burnetii
Organisms in the order Rickettsiales form a diverse group
of small (0.3 to 0.5 x 0.8 to 2.0 μm), non-motile,
pleomorphic Gram-negative bacteria which replicate only
in host cells. They can be cultured in the yolk sac of
embryonated eggs or in selected tissue culture cell lines.
Because they stain poorly with aniline dyes, these
organisms should be stained by Romanowsky methods
such as Giemsa or Leishman. In addition to host-cell
dependence and poor affinity for basic dyes, a requirement
for an invertebrate vector distinguishes them from
conventional bacteria and the Chlamydiales.
The application of ribosomal RNA sequencing techniques
and other precise analytical methods has led to extensive
reclassification of the organisms in the Rickettsiales. The
family Bartonellaceae has been removed from the order
(Brenner et al., 1993) and Coxiella burnetii, which is
genotypically and pheno- typically distinct from other
members of the group, is now placed in the gamma
subgroup  of   the proteobacteria  within  the order
Legionellales. Coxiella burnetii is dealt with in this chapter
under a separate section. The genera Haemobartonella and
Eperythrozoon,previously
 classified  in
the
Anaplasmataceae, have been transferred to the genus
Mycoplasma (Neimark et al., 2001, 2002).
At
present,  two  families,  Rickettsiaceae
 and
Anaplasmataceae, comprise the Rickettsiales (Fig. 40.1).
1056
The species in the family Rickettsiales awaiting definitive
assignment are in quotation marks in Fig. 40.1 and Table
40.1. The members of the family Rickettsiaceae have cell
walls similar to those of other Gram-negative bacteria.
Ultrastructural
 studies
have
shown
that
　the
Anaplasmataceae
have
outer membranes
swhichare
generally similar to those of Gram-negative bacteria but
lack an obvious peptidoglycan layer. Organisms in the
family Rickettsiaceae, referred to as rickettsiae, generally
target endothelial cells. Although several new species of
rickettsiae have recently been identified in domestic
animals using molecular techniques, their pathogenicity is
uncertain and currently the only species of veterinary
importance in the familyRickettsiaceae is Rickettsia
rickettsi, the cause of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Members of the Anaplasmataceae comprise four genera of
veterinary
importance,
Anaplasma,
Ehrlichia,
Neorickettsia and Aegyptianella. Organisms in this family
parasitize cells of haemopoietic origin, and species of
organisms previously known as HGE (human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis)
agent, Ehrlichia
lequiandEhrlichia
phagocytophila, have been unified under the single species
Anaplasma phagocytophilum.

Epidemiology
1059
Animal hosts and arthropod vectors are the reservoirs for
most organisms in the Rickettsiales. Some organisms,
including Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma marginale and A.
phagocytophilum, produce latent infections. In arthropods.
rickettsiae replicate in the epithelial cells of the gut before
spreading to other organs, including the salivary glands
and ovaries, where further replication may occur.
Organisms are transmitted when the arthropod feeds on the
animal host. Some organisms such as Rickettsia rickettsii
are maintained in a tick population by transovarial
transmission. Transmission
of
E.
canis  and  A.
phagocytophilumoccurs inticksby trans-stadialbut not
transovarial routes. The majority of members of the
Rickettsiales are transmitted by arthropods but the vectors
of some Ehrlichia species have not yet been clearly
defined (Table 40.1). Transmission by flukes has been
confirmed for Neorickettsia species, with N. risticii having
a complex life cycle involving an intermediate snail
reservoir and a trematode vector. Members of the
Rickettsiales are labile outside host cells, and for some
species a silent cycle involving ticks and small wild
mammals may constitute a possible source of infection for
domestic animals.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Many Rickettsia species including the causal agents of
typhus (R. prowazekii), murine typhus (R. typhi) and scrub
typhus (R. tsutsugamushi) are primarily human pathogens.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, caused by Rickettsia
rickettsi, which is a common rickettsial disease of
humans, also affects dogs. These highly pathogenic
organisms have a predilection for the endothelial cells of
1060
small blood vessels, resulting in vasculitis and thrombosis
in many organs. Rickettsia
species produce phospholipase which damages  the
membranes of phagosomes allowing the organisms to
escape into the cytoplasm. Rickettsia rickettsii replicates in
both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of host cells, inducing
cytotoxic effects
UnlikeRickettsia
species,  all
members  of  the
Anaplasmataceae replicate within phagosomes in the host
cell by inhibiting phagosome/lysosome fusion. Reticulate
and dense-core forms are described and both divide by
binary fission. Dense-core forms predominate late in
infection and it is suggested that these may be the
infectious forms, perhaps because they possess many
adhesins. Organisms are released from cells by cell lysis or
exocytosis. Ehrlichia species, with the exception of the
human pathogens E. chaffeensis and E. sennetsu, are
pathogens of domestic and feral animals. These organisms
have a predilection for leukocytes and, in the case of E.
ruminantium,
vascular
endothelium.
Ehrlichia
ruminantium, the cause of heartwater in ruminants,
probably parasitizes macrophages and other cell types in
lymphoid tissues during the initial phase of infection.
Organisms finally localize in membrane-bound vacuoles in
endothelial cells throughout the body.
Two species in the genus Neorickettsia cause acute febrile
disease in dogs. These organisms, which localize
predominantly in lymph nodes, produce a generalized
lymphadenopathy

Many Anaplasma species andAegyptianella pullorum
parasitize red blood cells and are found within vacuoles in
this cell type. Other members of the genus, including A.
phagocytophilum and A. bovis, target granulocytes and A.

this family to survive and replicate within granulocytes is
unique among bacterial organisms.

These difficult procedures are usually performed only in
laboratories engaged in research or vaccine production.
·Blood or tissue smears stained by the Giemsa technique can
be used to demonstrate the morphology of members of the
Anaplasmataceae. They occur as purplish blue, small,
individual organisms, sometimes in clusters, or as morulae
up to 4.0 μm in diameter. Those Ehrlichia and Anaplasma
species that are found in granulocytes or platelets can be
demonstrated in blood smears from animals in the early
stages of disease. Species that target mono- cytes are present
less frequently in blood smears.
· Fluorescent antibody techniques can be used to identify R.

Clinical infections
Rickettsial organisms are relatively host-specific. Because
definitive arthropod or fluke vectors are involved in the
transmission of members of the Rickettsiales, diseases
associated with these organisms tend to occur in defined
geographical regions (Table 40.1). In many instances, the
clinical signs reflect the targeting of a particular cell type
by the causal agent. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis
caused by variants of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and
Rocky Mountain spotted fever are important zoonotic
diseases, as is Q fever.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever in dogs
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, caused by Rickettsia
rickettsi, affects mainly humans and dogs. In North
America,the main tick vectors are Dermacentor variabilis
and D.  andersoni.  Rhipicephalus sanguineus and
1063
and South America. Ticks acquire the pathogen while
feeding on infected small wild mammals. Rickettsia
rickettsii is maintained in the tick population by
transovarial and trans-stadial transmission and thus the tick
acts as both a reservoir and a vector of the organism. An
infected tick must remain attached for up to
20 hours before salivary transmission to the host occurs.
The organisms, which replicate in endothelial cells of
infected dogs, produce vasculitis, increased vascular
permeability and haemorrhage.
Clinical signs
The incubation period of the disease is 2 to 10 days and the
course is usually less than 2 weeks. Clinical signs include
fever, depression, conjunctivitis, retinal haemorrhages,
muscle and joint pain, coughing, dyspnoea and oedema of
the extremities. Neurological disturbance, which occurs in
about 80% of affected dogs, presents as stupor, ataxia,
neck rigidity, seizures and coma. Dogs with mild disease
and those treated early following infection usually recover.
In severe disease, death may result from cardiovascular.
neurological or renal damage. At post-mortem, there is
widespread haemorrhage, splenomegaly and generalized
lymphadenopathy
Diagnosis
Rocky Mountain spotted fever should be considered in dogs
with systemic disease which have been exposed to ticks in
endemic areas.
1064
·Indirect fluorescent antibody test or ELISA demonstrating a
rising antibody titre to R. rickettsii is diagnostic. Antibodies
are not demonstrable until at least 10 days after infection.
·A marked thrombocytopenia and leukopenia may be present
during the acute phase of the disease.
       as
monocytic ehrlichiosis.
·PCR detection in canine and tick tissues has been described
by a number of workers.
Treatment and control
Tetracycline therapy, which usually produces clinical
improvement within 24 hours, must be continued for 2
weeks.
· Supportive therapy is necessary for severely debilitated
dogs.
Frequent removal of ticks is recommended. Because the
disease is zoonotic, gloves should be worn during this
procedure or a forceps should be used.
Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis
Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, a generalized disease of
Canidae caused by Ehrlichia canis, is confined to tropical
and subtropical regions. Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the
brown tick, is one of the main vectors and trans-stadial
transmission occurs. After detachment from an infected
host, ticks can transmit the agent to susceptible dogs for up
to 5 months. Dogs often remain carriers for more than 2
years  after  recovery
from acute  disease. Human
ehrlichiosis is caused by E. chaffeensis which is closely
related to E. canis.
Clinical signs
1065
Following an incubation period lasting up to 3 weeks, the
disease can progress through acute, subclinical and chronic
phases (Fig. 40.2). The acute phase, in which signs range
from
1mild to severe, is characterized by fever,
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and anaemia. Most affected
dogs recover but some progress to a subclinical phase
lasting months or years during which low blood cell values
persist but clinical signs are minimal. A minority of these
dogs later develop a severe form of the disease known as
tropical canine pancytopenia. Persistent bone marrow
depression,  along
with
haemorrhages, neurological
disturbance, peripheral oedema and emaciation, are
characteristic of this phase of the disease. Hypotensive
shock may ultimately develop, leading to death (Rikihisa,
1991). Progression to this chronic phase of the disease may
be influenced by factors such as breed susceptibility,
immunosuppression and the virulence of the infecting
strain of E. canis.
Diagnosis
·Typical clinical and haematological features in dogs exposed
to ticks in an endemic area may suggest canine monocytic
ehrlichiosis.
·Morulae of E. canis may be detected in mononuclear cells in
Giemsa-stained smears of the buffy- coat layer prepared
from peripheral blood.
· Seroconversion can be demonstrated 3 weeks after infection
using indirect immunofluorescence. Antibody titres of 1:10
or greater are considered to be indicative of infection.
·Culture of E. canis in a canine macrophage cell line is
possible although time-consuming.
Detection using PCR-based methods is now the more
common method used for demonstration of the infection.

Tetracyclines can be administered to susceptible dogs
entering an endemic area as a short-term prophylactic
measure.

Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis
This disease, described in both dogs and humans in the
USA, is caused by Ehrlichia ewingii (Anderson et al.,
1067
1992). Neutrophils are the primary target cells for the
pathogen. Infected dogs, which exhibit mild clinical signs,
recover uneventfully.
Canine cyclic thrombocytopenia
Anaplasma platys, the cause of this condition, parasitizes
platelets. In infected dogs thrombocytopenia recurs at
intervals of about 10 days, usually without evidence of
clinical disease. Seroconversion, detected by indirect
immunofluorescence, can be demonstrated about 2 weeks
after infection.
Potomac horse fever
Potomac horse fever, also known as equine monocytic
ehrlichiosis and equine ehrlichial colitis, is caused by
Neorickettsia risticii. Originally described in 1970 in
horses near the Potomac river in Virginia and Maryland.
the disease has now been reported throughout North
fever occurs during summer months and the life cycle
involves a fluke vector in which transovarial transmission
occurs, and an intermediate snail reservoir. Transmission
to horses probably occurs following ingestion of aquatic
insects infested with infected metacercariae. Neorickettsia
risticii infects epithelial cells of the crypts in the colon and
also targets monocytes, tissue macrophages and mast cells
Clinical signs
Fever, anorexia, depression, colic, leukopenia and
laminitis may be evident. The case fatality rate can reach
1068
30%. Transplacental transmission of E. risticii may occur
and the agent may induce abortion (Holland and Ristic,
1993). Patchy hyperaemia of the large intestine may be
found at post- mortem (Rikihisa, 1991).

Treatment and control
·Oxytetracycline intravenously for 7 days is therapeutically
effective.
·Inactivated vaccines, commercially available in North
America, are not fully effective.
Bovine petechial fever
Bovine petechial fever, also called Ondiri disease, which
occurs in both wild and domestic ruminants, is caused by
Ehrlichia ondiri'. Clinical disease is most common in
cattle imported into endemic areas. The disease is limited
to highland areas of Kenya and other East African
countries, and the vector is considered to be a species of
tick with restricted distribution.‘Ehrlichia ondiri' is
thought to replicate initially in the spleen and to spread
subsequently to other organs. Clinical signs include high
fluctuating fever, depressed milk yield and widespread
petechiation of visible mucous membranes. Oedema and
1069
petechiation of the conjunctiva produces ‘poached-egg'
eye, a feature typical of severe cases. Death often results
from pulmonary oedema. Recovered animals, which
become carriers, are resistant to reinfection for at least 2
years. The organisms are often found in granulocytes in
smears of peripheral blood stained by the Giemsa method.
Tetracyclines are effective only when administered during
the incubation period of the disease.
Tick-borne fever
Tick-borne fever (TBF) is a rickettsial disease of domestic
and wild ruminants caused by variants of Anaplasma
phagocytophilum.The disease tends to be endemic on
certain tick-infected upland farms in some European
countries. The main vector is the tick, Ixodes ricinus, in
which trans-stadial transmission occurs. Transmission to
ruminant hosts occurs through the bites of infected ticks
and, less commonly, through contaminated instruments.
Recovered animals are immune to challenge with the
homologous strain of A. phagocytophilum but remain
infected for up to 2 years and act as reservoirs of infection
for ticks. Since the maintenance of immunity appears to be
related to repeated exposure to A. phagocytophilum.
removal of animals from tick- infected pastures results in a
decline in protective immunity. Recent findings indicate
that several species of small rodents such as shrews and
voles are competent hosts of A. phagocytophilum and thus
may be important reservoirs of infection (Woldehiwet,
2006).
Pathogenesis
1070
Anaplasma phagocytophilum is unusual in its ability to
survive and multiply within neutrophils, eosinophils and
monocytes. The ability to survive in these cells is related to
its ability to inhibit lysosomal fusion with the cytoplasmic
vacuoles within which it multiplies. In addition, it delays
apoptosis of infected cells which allows the organism to
complete its replication in spite of the short lifespan of
these cells. Up-regulation of the chemokine IL-8 by A.
phagocytophilum helps multiplication of the organism as it
recruits uninfected neutrophils to the site of infection.
These neutrophils then become infected and further
disseminate the organism.
Carrier animals which have recovered from infection show
recurrent bouts of bacteraemia. Persistence of infection
may be related to antigenic variation of outer membrane
proteins  and immune  evasion.  Immunosuppression  is
characteristic of infection with A. phagocytophilum and is
a consequence of severe leukopenia and impaired function
of neutrophils and lymphocytes.
Clinical signs
Clinical signs, which develop after an incubation period of
up to 13 days, include fever, inappetence and a reduced
growth rate in young animals. A drop in milk production
and abortions or stillbirths may occur in naive, pregnant
animals after transfer to farms where the disease is
endemic (Jones and Davies, 1995). Most affected animals
recover within 2 weeks. However, A. phagocytophilum
depresses   both   antibody-mediated    and   cell-mediated
immune responses, increasing the susceptibility of young
lambs to tick pyaemia and louping ill, diseases which are
1071
also  tick-transmitted.  Haematological
 changes in
tick-borne fever include leukopenia and transient
thrombocytopenia.
Diagnosis
The disease should be consideredin sick ruminants on
tick-infected pastures in endemic regions.
·In Giemsa-stained blood smears, more than 70% of
neutrophils contain intracytoplasmic blue morulae during the
febrile period of the disease (Fig. 40.3).
·Indirect immunofluorescence is used to detect rising
antibody titres.
· PCR-based techniques, including real-time RT- PCR, have
been described (Sirigireddy et al., 2006).
·Differentiation of variants of A. phagocytophilum causing
TBF from variants that infect humans, dogs and horses can
be achieved by sequencing amplified fragments of the 16S
rRNA gene (Woldehiwet, 2006).

Equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis
This disease, often known as equine ehrlichiosis, is caused
by variants of Anaplasma phagocytophilum which infect
horses. The organism was previously thought to be a
different species from the agent causing tick-bome fever
and was known as Ehrlichia equi. It has been reported in
the USA, some European countries and Israel. Clinical
signs include fever, depression, ataxia, limb oedema,
icterus
 and  petechial
haemorrhages
on
mucous
membranes. The disease is relatively mild, the mortality
rate is low and cases tend to occur in late autumn and in
winter. Transmission is by Xxodes species of ticks.

Heartwater
1073
Heartwater, caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium, is a severe
disease of ruminants limited to regions of sub- Saharan
Africa and some Caribbean islands. Ticks belonging to
Amblyomma species are the main vectors. Wild ruminants
such as wildebeest become subclinically infected and the
disease can be comparatively mild in indigenous breeds of
domestic cattle in which a carrier state can be maintained
for up to 8 months. Clinical disease develops in calves and
lambs and in newly introduced breeds of Bos taurus.
Ehrlichia ruminantium replicates in reticuloendothelial
cells, particularly macrophages, and in endothelial cells of
capillaries, especially those of the central nervous system.
Damage to vascular endothelium results in increased
permeability and widespread petechial haemorrhage.
Clinical signs
Sudden onset of fever occurs following an incubation
period of 1 to 4 weeks. Neurological signs are common
and include chewing movements, twitching of eyelids.
high-stepping gait, circling and recumbency. Death often
occurs during convulsions in acute cases. In subacute
disease, lesions include hydropericardium, hydrothorax.
pulmonary oedema and congestion. Splenomegaly and
extensive  mucosal  and serosal  haemorrhages  may  be
evident.
Diagnosis
· In endemic regions, nervous signs and post mortem findings
provide a presumptive diagnosis.
1074
· Squash preparations of brain tissue, stained by the Giemsa
method, may disclose the organisms located close to nuclei
of endothelial cells.
· Nucleic acid probes, including polymerase chain reaction
techniques, can be used on tissues from clinically affected
cattle.
·Indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA and western blot
procedures are used todemonstrate antibodies to E.
ruminantium.
 PCR assays, including quantitative real-time PCR, have been
described (Steyn et al., 2008).
Treatment and control
·Tetracycline therapy administered early in the disease may
be effective.
· Immunization by inoculating blood from infected sheep,
along with tetracycline therapy, may be used.
· Tick control is expensive and often impractical. However, as
a consequence of tick control measures, immunity in
indigenous stock may decline due to the lack of challenge
with the infectious agent through repeated exposure to ticks.
Salmon poisoning disease
Salmonpoisoning
 disease, caused by Neorickettsia
helminthoeca, is an acute and frequently fatal infection of
Canidae. The pathogen passes through the
developmental stages in a snail-fish-dog cycle of the
fluke, Nanophyetus salmincola. Dogs become infected by
ingesting raw salmon containing fluke metacercariae.
Neorickettsia helminthoeca enters the blood-stream
following attachment of the fluke to the intestinal mucosa
of the canine host. Replication of the bacterium in
lymphoid tissues results in generalized lymphadenopathy.
The disease is limited to the northwest Pacific coast of
1075
North America and occurs close to rivers into which the
salmon migrate.
Clinical signs
Signs of illness develop abruptly about 7 days after
ingestion of raw fish. Fever, anorexia, weakness and
depression are followed by persistent vomiting and bloody
diarrhoea. Death ensues in 7 to 10 days in up to 90% of
untreated dogs. Animals that survive are usually resistant
to reinfection.
Diagnosis
·A history of access to raw fish in endemic areas and the
presence of fluke eggs in the faeces of severely ill dogs are
suggestive of the infection.
· Organisms can be demonstrated in macrophages in lymph
node aspirates stained by the Giemsa method.
·  Infection with canine parvovirus 2 and canine distemper
virus may be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Treatment and control
·Tetracyclines, sulphonamides or chloramphenicol may be
effective if administered early in the course of disease.
· Supportive therapy may be necessary in dehydrated or
anaemic animals.
·Raw fish should not be fed to dogs in endemic areas.
·A vaccine is not available.
Elokomin fluke fever
Neorickettsia elokominica', the cause of Elokomin fluke
fever, is morphologically indistinguishable from N.
helminthoeca and has the same fluke vector. The disease is
1076
milder than salmon poisoning disease and has a wider host
range which includes Canidae, bears, racoons and ferrets.
Neorickettsia elokominica' infection may be concurrent
with N. helminthoeca infection and  there is
n0
cross-protection between the two organisms.
Bovine anaplasmosis
Bovine anaplasmosis, or gall sickness, caused by
Anaplasma marginale, affects cattle in tropical and
subtropical regions. The disease, which is characterized by
fever, anaemia and icterus, is often inapparent in animals
in endemic areas. In young calves, infections are mild and
result in the development of a carrier state. Carrier animals
may develop mild clinical signs when stressed. Although
severe  clinical  disease may develop  in  susceptible
yearlings introduced into an endemic area, most recover.
In contrast, the mortality rate in naive adult cattle may
approach 50%. Morulae of Anaplasma marginale are
located inside erythrocytes close to the cell membrane. The
main vectors are
ticks of Boophilus  species but
  n  o  ss
Instruments contaminated with infected blood may also be
a source of infection. Anaplasma marginale has six major
outer surface proteins, three of which vary antigenically.
However, although several genotypes of A. marginale have
been identified, infection exclusion occurs, with only one
genotype establishing

development of vaccines capable of inducing cross-
protection against multiple genotypes is important as new
genotypes of the organisms may be introduced into an area
whenanimalsharbouring
gdistinctgenotypesofthe
1077
pathogen are introduced into a region for the first time
(Kocan et al., 2004).
Clinical signs
The incubation period ranges from 2 to 12 weeks. Clinical
signs include inappetence, depression and reduced milk
yield. Marked anaemia and jaundice develop in the
absence of
haemoglobinuria, and   weight
loss is
pronounced. Affected cattle may die suddenly from
hypoxia if they are handled roughly. Resistance of
recovered
1  animals  to  re-infection  is  dependent
on
persistence of A. marginale in tissues.
Diagnosis
Clinical  signs  and  haematological  findings  in   stressed
indigenous cattle or in naive cattle introduced into an
endemic area may suggest the condition.
Giemsa-stained blood smears may contain densely staining
bodies (0.3 to 1.0 μm in diameter) located near the periphery
of erythrocytes. The organisms are most numerous about 10
days after the onset of fever, when up to 50% of erythrocytes
can be affected.
immunofluorescence.
· A radioactive RNA probe and a polymerase chain
reaction-based method are sensitive techniques used  for
detecting the pathogen.
·Serological tests are of particular value in detecting latent
infections. These tests include the complement fixation test,
the card agglutination test, ELISA and dot enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay.
Treatment and control
1078
· Long-acting oxytetracycline or  imidocarb dipropionate,
administered early in the disease, are effective.
·Supportive therapy is essential in severe cases.
· In endemic areas, control measures are aimed at minimizing
stress in indigenously reared cattle.
 Prior to introduction into an endemic region, animals must
be vaccinated. A live A. centrale vaccine, which provides
partial protection against A. marginale, is used only in
calves. Attenuated and inactivated A. marginale vaccines are
also available.
Aegyptianellosis in poultry
This disease, caused by Aegyptianella pullorum, affects
poultry and wild birds. The vector is a tick of the genus
Argus. Infected birds have ruffled feathers, anorexia,
diarrhoea, anaemia and hyperthermia. Lesions include
hepatosplenomegaly  and punctiform haemorrhages  on
serosal surfaces. Control of ticks is important and
tetracyclines are effective for therapy.
Q fever
The acute form of Q (query) fever, caused by Coxiella
farmers, abattoir workers, veterinarians and others in
contact with farm animals and their products. Subclinical
disease is more common than clinical infection, and
endocarditis is the principal form of the chronic disease.
    a   s
without apparent contact with farm animals, perhaps
resulting from windborme transmission of the organism
(Arricau-Bouvery and Rodolakis, 2005). Although an
obligate intracellular pathogen, C. burnetii forms small
resistant forms during replication and these endospore-like
1079
forms remain viable in the environment for up to 150 days
Coxiella burneti grows preferentially  in  the acid
environment  of phagolysosomes of macrophages and
monocytes and many of its metabolic activities are
detectable only at pH 5 or lower (Redd and Thompson,
1995). Most infections are acquired by inhalation of
aerosols originating from parturient sheep, goats or cattle.
Coxiella burnetii localizes and replicates in the female
genital tract and mammary glands of ruminants with
intermittent or continuous shedding of organisms in uterine
discharges, foetal fluids, urine and milk. Rare outbreaks of
Q fever have been associated with exposure to parturient
cats (Langley et al., 1988). Laboratory infections are
common. Although several genera of ticks serve as carriers
of C. burnetii, infection following tick bites is relatively
rare. Ingestion of milk or milk products contaminated with
C. burnetii usually results in asymptomatic infections in
humans. Vertical and sexual transmission of infection is
possible in animals. Most infections in domestic animals
are subclinical. However, rare sporadic abortions have
been described in sheep, goats, cattle and cats. In
ruminants, infection may also result in infertility or the
birth of weak offspring. Placentitis or endometritis may be
evident. Foetal lesions include hepatitis, myocarditis and
interstitial pneumonia (Campbell, 1994).
Diagnosis
To prevent human infections, specimens must be collected
and handled with care, and diagnostic procedures must be
carried out in a biohazard safety cabinet.
1080
· Smears from placental tissue and uterine discharges stained
by the MZN method reveal small clumps of red
coccobacillary bodies. Demonstration of the organism by the
MZN staining method combined with serological results
from the affected group of animals provide an adequate basis
for diagnosis of infection (Anon., 2008).
·Immunofluorescence can be used to demonstrate the
organisms in placental smears.
· Polymerase chain reaction procedures are used to detect
small numbers of organisms in different sample types
including aborted materials, milk and faeces (Anon, 2008).
·Coxiella burnetii can be cultured in the yolk sac of 5 to
7-day-old embryonated eggs.
 Serological tests for C. burnetii include the complement
fixation test, indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA and a
competitive immunoassay (Soliman et al., 1992)
Control
·Segregation of parturient ruminants and careful disposal of
placentas  and aborted  foetuses are essential  following
confirmation of disease.
·Inactivated egg-yolk vaccines are available for annual
vaccination of non-pregnant ruminants.
·A vaccine suitable for laboratory and abattoir workers who
are at high risk of infection is available.

Chapter 41
Bacterial species of limited pathogenic significance
This  heterogeneous  group  of  Gram-negative bacteria
contains organisms which occasionally produce disease in
domestic animals (Table 4l.1) and also a number of
bacterial  species of uncertain pathogenicity  which are
commonly isolated from clinical specimens (Table 41.2),
Apart from Neisseria species which are Gram-negative
cocci, the organisms in the group are Gram-negative rods.
Acinetobacter species
Organisms belonging to the Acinetobacter species are
Gram-negative coccobacilli, which are easily isolated on
standard culture media. They are environmental organisms
which cause opportunistic infections in humans and
animals, especially in hospital settings. Acinetobacter
baumannii, A. calcoaceticus and A. woffii are the most
commonly isolated species. Many strains are resistant to
multiple antimicrobial agents and strains have been
isolated from human patients which are resistant to all
commercially
 available
agents
(Munoz-Price
and
Weinstein, 2008). All A.
.baumannii isolates contain
chromosomally-encoded cephalosporinases.  The AmpC
gene encoding these enzymes is normally expressed at low
levels but clinical resistance occurs when a promoter
insertion sequence close to the AmpC gene causes its
   nd  ss
of resistance in Acinetobacter species and can expel
β-lactam  antibiotics,  quinolones,  tetracyclines  and
1086
chloramphenicol. Acquired resistance to the carbapenem
group
  of  anti-microbials through
the action
of
metallo-β-lactamases is an emerging problem in human
medicine, and strains which have acquired these enzymes
have been reported in many parts of the world. In animals,
Acinetobacter species have been isolated from different
clinical    conditions 
 including post-operative wound
infections and septicaemia (Abbott et al., 2005;
Brachelente et al., 2007: Weese, 2008). Antimicrobial
treatment of infection can be challenging when an isolate
is multi-drug resistant. Control of Acinetobacter infections
is most successful when a point source can be identified,
but general control measures include thorough cleaning of
physical facilities, improved infection control measures,
surveillance and isolation (Munoz-Price and Weinstein,
2008).
Bartonella species
The genus Bartonella, which was formerly classified in the
order Rickettsiales, contains 19 recognized species at
present
(Table  41.3).
0.Theorganismsarethin,
Gram-negative, slightly curved rods, which grow only on
blood-enriched media. Growth is slow and colonies may
require up to 4 weeks to develop.
Epidemiology
Bartonella species are carried by a number of wild and
domestic animals (Table 4l.3) and transmission usually
occurs by means of an arthropod vector. Bartonella
henselae is carried by healthy cats and is transmitted from
cat to cat by the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, without
1087
causing clinical signs. Infection is more common in
warmer climates than in temperate countries and affects
younger animals. Serological
 surveys in humans and
animals indicate increasing prevalence of infection from
temperate to tropical regions. Kittens may be bacteraemic
for weeks to months. Transmission to humans usually
occurs by means of a scratch and less commonly by means
of cat bites. It is suggested that the organism may enter the
scratch from contaminated flea faeces which adheres to the
claw of the cat (Chomel et al., 2006).

Pathogenesis
These bacteria are present in red blood cells and vascular
endothelial cells. Mandle et al. (2005) reported that the
organism invades the red-cell progenitor cells in the bone
marrow, resulting in the presence of the organism in
circulating red blood cells. In humans, infection with B.
henselae,B.clarridgeiae or B. koehlerae causes cat
scratch disease, with signs developing 1 to 3 weeks after
the scratch or bite of a cat. In some cases, a small skin
visible at the site of inoculation. Other signs include
lymphadenitis and systemic signs such as fever, malaise
and headaches. Usually the condition resolves without

Diagnostic procedures
1091
·Bartonelfa species are readily identified in tissues with silver
stains such as Warthin-Starry stain.
·These organisms are difficult to isolate; they grow on
blood-enriched media following several weeks of incubation
at 37°C. Isolation from bacteraemic cats may be enhanced
by lysis of the feline red blood cells by freezing the blood
sample before it is cultured.
· Isolates cannot be identified using conventional biochemical
tests but cell wall fatty acid profiles can be used for
identification. Increasingly, identification is by molecular
methods such as PCR or partial sequencing techniques
(Boulouis et al., 2005).
·  Isolation of the organism from clinical specimens is even
more difficult than from the blood of bacteraemic cats.
Bacterial detection in such specimens is usually by
extraction of DNA from tissues followed by PCR-based
techniques.
· Serology is used for the diagnosis of clinical disease but is
not useful for the detection of bacteraemia in cats as such
animals may be seronegative when sampled. The most
frequently used serological tests are IFA and ELISA.
Treatment and control
Antimicrobialtherapy

immunocompetent people is not required. Prolonged
treatment with antibiotics is needed for bacillary
angiomatosis affecting immunocompromised individuals.
In vitro susceptibility testing, which can be carried out
using agar dilution or E test methods (Dorbecker et al.,
2006), does not always reflect in vivo results, probably due
to the intracellular nature of the organism. Effective
regimes for the elimination of bacteraemia in cats have not
been established although treatment with doxycycline or
enrofloxacin for 2 to 4 weeks has been used for this
1092
purpose (Breitschwerdt, 2008). Control of infection in cats
is based largely on elimination of the flea vector.
Aeromonas species, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Vibrio
species
Aeromonas species, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Vibrio
species are Gram-negative bacteria with a number of
common attributes.
They
are
 found in aquatic
environments,  possess
somesimilarbiochemical
characteristics and morphological features, and are
opportunistic pathogens of fish, reptiles and rarely
mammals. Vibrio cholerae, an important human pathogen,
produces cholera which is a severe, life-threatening,
enteric infection.
Morphologically, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas species are
straight, medium-sized rods, unlike Vibrio species which
are curved. Most members of these genera are
catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, facultative anaerobes
which are motile by polar flagella. The positive oxidase
reaction distinguishes this group of organisms from
members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Although Aeromonas
species and Plesiomonas shigelloides  grow(
on
non-enriched media, many Vibrio species are halophilic
The optimal temperature for growth of some species in the
group is lower than 37?C. Microaerophilic organisms,
formerly classified as Vibrio species, are now assigned to
the genus Campylobacter.
Aeromonas species and P. shigelloides are found in fresh
water and are present in the oral cavity and on the skin of
1093
fish and reptiles. Most Vibrio species are found in brackish
and salt water.
Clinical infections
Members of these genera are primarily pathogens of fish
and reptiles, although some species can infect mammals
and birds. Infections are usually opportunistic, requiring
stress factors for the initiation of disease. Species which
have been associated with disease processes are included
in Table 41.1. Aeromonas hydrophila, P. shigelloides and
V. metschnikovi are the opportunistic pathogens which
have been most often encountered in domestic animals and
humans.
The pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the production
of disease are poorly understood. Aeromonas hydrophila
produces a number of virulence factors including adhesins,
exoenzymes, haemolysin and enterotoxins. This organism
has been associated occasionally with disease conditions in
domestic animals. Abortion attributed to A. hydrophila was
recorded in cattle (Wohlgemuth et al., 1972). The
organism has also been isolated from a young dog with
septicaemia (Pierce et al., 1973). Experimentally, A.
hydrophila produces haemorrhagic colitis in rabbits (Hibbs
et al., 1971).
Pathogenic strains of Plesiomonas shigelloides, which
cause diarrhoea in humans, produce enterotoxins. The
geographical distribution of this organism is limited to
tropical and subtropical regions.
1094
Apart from the important human pathogen, V. cholerae,
there are at least five other species which cause enteric
infections in humans. Food poisoning caused by Vibrio
parahaemolyticus is associated with the consumption of
raw or undercooked seafoods. Vibrio metschnikovii causes
enteric disease in chickens. Listonella anguillarum (Vibrio
anguillarum)and some Vibrio species are pathogens of
fish.
Diagnostic procedures
Adefinitive diagnosis requires
 the  isolation
and
identification of the pathogen from lesions. Because of the
widespread distribution of the majority of these bacteria in
the environment, laboratory results should be interpreted
with caution.
Treatment
Antibiotic therapy should be based on susceptibility testing
of Aeromonas species and P. shigelloides. Cephalosporins
may be of therapeutic value. Gentamicin and nalidixic acid
are usually effective for the treatment of infections caused
by Vibrio species.
Chromobacteriumviolaceum
Chromobacterium violaceum is a motile, Gram-negative
rod which grows on MacConkey agar and on nutrient agar
with the production of a non-diffusible violet pigment.
This bacterium is a catalase-positive, oxidase- positive
facultative anaerobe which is found in soil and water of
subtropical and tropical regions.
1095
Septicaemic infections with C. violaceum have been
recorded in humans, pigs and dogs (Gogolewski, 1983).
The    organism    has    been   associated
withacute
pleuropneumonia in Barbary sheep (Carrasco et al., 1996)
and pigs (Liu et al., 1989).
Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale
This organism has been associated with respiratory disease
in chickens and turkeys (Hinz et al., 1994) but has been
isolated from many wild and domesticated species of birds.
It is a pleomorphic Gram-negative rod which grows on
blood  agar  producing 
small, grey, non-haemolytic
colonies.  Although
Ornithobacteriumrhinotracheale
grows in an aerobic environment, growth is enhanced in 5
to 10% CO2. The organism is oxidase- positive and
catalase-negative (Charlton et al., 1993). Transmission of
infection can take place by horizontal and vertical routes.
Clinical infections are most severe in older chickens and
turkeys and severity is also dependent on the presence of
concurrent    infections
and
management
factors.
Antimicrobial susceptibility varies greatly between strains
    m  n s o 
days at 200 ppm is usually effective.
Riemerellaanatipestifer
This
Sorganism,  previously  designated  Pasteurella
anatipestifer,
1S
a
 non-motile,
asaccharolytic
Gram-negative rod which grows optimally on enriched
media in an atmosphere of 5 to 10% CO2. It is non-
haemolytic on blood agar and does not grow on
MacConkey agar. Infection with this organism can cause
1096
septicaemia primarily affecting ducklings up to 6 weeks of
age although older waterfowl, turkey poults, chickens and
pheasants can also be affected. The disease in ducklings is
usually precipitated by stress. Clinical signs include ocular
and nasal discharges, head and neck tremors and
incoordination. Mortality may reach 70%. Fibrinous
pericarditis and peritonitis are  common  post-mortem
findings. Meningitis and fibrinous airsacculitis may also be
present.  Twenty-one serotypes of this organism are
currently recognized and multiple serotypes may occur on
a single farm. Because of this, serotyping may not always
provide  useful epidemiological  data and newer  typing
methods such as PCR-based techniques or SmaI
macrorestriction analysis may provide more useful
information (Kiss et al., 2007). Early treatment with
ampicillin, amoxicillin or tetracyclines may be effective. A
bacterin and a live avirulent vaccine are available.
Streptobacillusmoniliformis
Streptobacillus
moniliformis,a highly pleomorphic
Gram-negative rod, is a normal inhabitant of the upper
respiratory tract of rodents. The organism occasionally
and  mice and  cervical  lymphadenitis  in  guinea-pig
colonies. Rare cases of synovitis and deaths are reported in
turkey flocks associated with rat bites. The bacterium is
responsible for Haverhill fever and rat-bite fever in
humans. Using PCR, the organism has been identified in
the mouths of dogs with known contact with rats but the
role of dogs as a source of infection in humans has not
been established (Wouters et al., 2008),

General features of fungi associated  with disease  in
animals
It is estimated that there are probably 1.5 million species in
the kingdom Fungi, of which more than 80,000 species
have been described. Approximately 4o0 fungal species
are pathogenic for humans and animals. Fungi are
eukaryotic, non-photosynthetic
heterotrophs
which
The taxonomy of the kingdom Fungi is in a state of flux
due to recent research based on DNA comparisons of
species. Traditionally, classification has been based on
morphological differences, physiology, the presence of
structural macromolecules and sexual mating. However, in
several   instances   molecular  studies
have revealed
morphologically  indistinguishable  fungi
iin the same
habitat to be different species. In 2007, a comprehensive
phylogenetic classification of the kingdom Fungi was
proposed (Hibbett et al., 2007) and this new classification
is reflected in the Dictionary of the Fungi (Kirk et al.,
2008)
and
the
Index
Fungorum
(www.indexfungorum.org). Five phyla in the kingdom are
recognized:Microspora
(Microsporidia),Ascomycota,
Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota and Glomeromycota.
The phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota have been
placed in the newly created sub-kingdom Dikarya. Twc
new phyla have been proposed: Chytridiomycota and
Neocallimastigomycota. The phylum Zygomycota is not
recognized   in   this   classification   scheme   pending
clarification of the relationships among the clades that are
1102
traditionally included in this phylum. Most zygomycetes of
veterinary importance have been placed in the sub- phylum
Mucormycotina which is currently listed as incertae sedis
(Latin, of uncertain placement). It is possible that the
phylum Zycomycota will be resurrected and validated to
include Mucormycotina in the future as the term is still in
use.

Traditional classification of the fungi relies heavily on
morphology and sexual reproduction. The form of a fungal
species during its sexually reproductive life cycle is termed
its teleomorph, while its asexual form
1103
is referred to as its anamorph. The preferred term for fungi
that lack a meiotic stage is mitosporic fungi. About a fifth
of all fungi, including many Aspergillus, Malassezia,
Penicillium and Coccidioides species, have no known
sexual stage. Formerly these fungi were placed in a
heterogeneous group called the Class Deuteromycota or
Fungi Imperfecti. Molecular methods are increasingly
being
 used
01
produce
phylogenetic trees which
demonstrate evolutionary relationships and to assign
fungal species to their appropriate grouping, even where
there is no known sexual form. Such methods usually
involve comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of highly
conserved ribosomal RNA, especially the small (18S)
subunit (SSU) and the large (26S) subunit (LSU) of
ribosomal DNA. Many fungi formerly assigned to the
Fungi Imperfecti have been transferred to the Ascomycota.
A dual naming system has been used for many years with
separate teleomorphic and anamorphic names. This system
 n  n    
sexualreproductive
mode
was recognized. In many
instances the anamorphic name is better known because it
isthe asexualform whichis associated with disease
production. This is illustrated by the dermatophyte
Microsporumcanis
whose
 teleomorph
name
1S
Arthroderma otae. It is expected that, with advances in
diagnostic molecular methods, the dual naming system
will eventually become unnecessary. Fungi of veterinary
importance are found in the three phyla Ascomycota,
Basidiomycotaand
1Zygomycota.Members of the
Chytridiomycota cause skin infections in frogs which
interfere with their ability to respire through their skin
(Rosenblum et al., 2010). Chytridiomycosis, first reported
in Australia, has subsequently been reported in many
1104
continents and has resulted in high mortality rates in
amphibians in Califormia, Central America and regions of
South America. The glomeromycetes, which are the
smallest group of fungi, are of major ecological
importance as plant symbionts which form arbuscular
mycorrhizal associations with plant roots. The phylum
Blastocladiomycota contains zoosporic fungi
The two main morphological fungal forms are moulds and
yeasts (Fig. 42.1). Moulds grow as branching filaments
called hyphae (2 to 10 μm in diameter) whereas the
unicellular yeasts have an oval or spherical appearance (3
to 5 μm in diameter). Dimorphic fungi occur in both mould
and yeast forms. Environmental factors usually determine
the form in which a dimorphic fungus occurs. Fungi such
as Candida albicans, which produce forms additional to
the two major forms, are described as polymorphic
Fungi grow aerobically and many are strict aerobes.
Temperatures appropriate  for the optimal  growth of
different groups of pathogenic fungi and the incubation
time required for the development of distinctive colonial
features are indicated in Table 42.1. Reproduction by spore
formation may be either sexual or asexual. In some species
both types of spore formation occur. Fungi tolerate high
osmotic pressures and acidic environments as low as pH
5.0.

Structure
1106
Hyphal cell walls, which impart rigidity and osmotic
stability,  are
 mainly
 composed
[  of   carbohydrate
components   including   chitin 
macromoleculeswith
cellulose cross-linkages. In yeasts, cell walls contain
protein complexed with polysaccharides and, in some
species, a range of lipid compounds. In the bilayered cell
membrane, which lines the cell wall in the fungi, the
predominant sterol is ergosterol in contrast to cholesterol,
which predominates in the cell membranes of animals.
Both moulds and yeasts have nuclei with well defined
nuclear membranes, mitochondria and networks of
microtubules. Septa (cross-walls) are often present in
hyphae.
Figure 42.2 Stages in the germination of a fungal spore
leading to the development of a branched hypha
Growth, reproduction and colonial formation
Airborne fungal spores germinate in locations where
environmental conditions are favourable. Spores swell and
their metabolic activity increases prior to the production of
tubular projections which develop into branched hyphae
(Fig. 42.2). The hyphal wall is thin and plastic at its tip
and, as apical growth occurs, cross-linkage of wall
1107
constituents results in maturation of the structure. Lateral
branches develop from hyphae at localized areas of
plasticity which allow outgrowth from the rigid mature cell
wall. Septa, formed by inward growth of the cell wall,
have central pores through which nutrients and organelles
may pass. Extension of hyphae and their lateral branches
results in the formation of a mycelium, an interlacing
network of hyphae.
Moulds tend to form large colonies with growth and
extension of hyphae at their peripheries. In some species,
mature elements at the centre of colonies produce
specialized aerial hyphae which support  spore-bearing
asexual reproduction, two main types of spores, conidia
and sporangiospores, are recognized. Conidia are formed
on conidiophores, and sporangiospores are formed within a
sporangium, a sac-like structure borne on an aerial hypha
termed a sporangiophore (Fig. 42.3). Sporangiospores are
formed only by fungi in the phylum Zygomycota. In
dermatophytes,
multicellular
structures
called
macroconidia and single-celled microconidia are produced
in cultures from lateral hyphal branches, whereas
arthroconidia are formed from the disintegration of hyphae
within keratinized structures. Asexual spores produced by
fungi are illustrated in Fig. 42.4.

In most yeasts, asexual division is by budding. Daughter
cells separate from parent cells after the formation of a
cross-wall at the point of budding. The colonies of
yeast-like fungi are soft, smooth and round.
Demonstration of the sexual stage of fungi, which is
usually conducted in specialized laboratories, is essential
for the taxonomic classification of phyla. A summary of
the features of the sexual spores of the Ascomycota,
Basidiomycota and Zygomycota is presented in Table 42.2.
General features of fungal disease
The pathogenetic mechanisms by which fungi produce
disease are listed in Box 42.1. The fungal diseases which
result from tissue invasion (mycoses) can be conveniently
categorized according to the sites of lesions (Table 42.3).
Superficial

such as Candida species or Malassezia pachydermatis.
The dermatophytoses, which are clinically more important
because of their communicability and zoonotic potential.
are associated with invasion and destruction of keratinized
structures by dermatophytes such as Microsporum species
and Trichophyton species. Subcutaneous mycoses result
from localized fungal invasion of the dermis and subcutis,
often following penetration by a foreign body. When
infection is caused by pigmented (dematiaceous) fungi, the
condition  is  termed  phaeohyphomycosis.  Tumour-like
granulomatous lesions are called mycetomas when caused
by
saprophytic fungi, and
 pseudomycetomas   when
associated with dermatophyte invasion. Systemic mycoses,
which often originate in the respiratory or digestive tracts,
usually   follow   opportunistic  infection  by  saprophytic
fungi. Factors that predispose to infection include
alteration in the normal microbial flora as a result of
prolonged   antimicrobial   therapy,   immunosuppression
following corticosteroid therapy or viral infection, and
exposure to high infective doses of spores in confined
spaces (Box 42.2).

· Prolonged antibiotic therapy
· Immunological defects
· Immaturity, ageing and malnutrition
·Exposure to heavy challenge of fungal spores
· Traumatized tissues
· Persistent moisture on skin surface

Diagnosis of fungal diseases
Mycological cultural procedures should be performed in a
biohazard cabinet because of the risk of human infection
from spore aerosols. Culture of Coccidioides immitis
should be attempted only in reference laboratories because
highly infective arthrospores are produced in cultures at
both 25°C and 37°C
diagnosis particularly in the dermatophytoses.
specimens from subcutaneous and systemic mycoses. Before
treatment commences, specimens should be collected from
the periphery of active lesions in an aseptic manner.
·Direct microscopic examination of wet preparations may be
confirmatory:
1113
- Ringworm arthrospores surrounding infected hairs or
hyphae in infected tissues may be demonstrable after
clearing specimens in a few drops of 10% KOH under a
coverslip for some hours.
-Cryptococcus neoformans can be demonstrated, in
cerebrospinal fluid mixed with India ink or nigrosin, as
budding cells with wide capsules.
- Sporing heads can be examined under a coverslip after
mounting a sample from a colony in a drop of lactophenol
cotton blue. Other methods for direct examination include
slide culture and transparent adhesive tape techniques. Yeast
cells can be stained with methylene blue or by the Gram
method.
· Fungi are usually isolated on Sabouraud dextrose agar (pH
5.5) which inhibits growth of most bacteria. The addition of
chloramphenicol and cycloheximide increases selectivity by
inhibiting some of the fast-growing contaminating fungi
such as the zygomycetes. To stimulate growth of the yeast
phase of dimorphic fungi, enriched media, such as
brain-heart infusion agar with 5% blood, and incubation at
37°C are required. Incubation times and temperatures for
culture of the various fungal groups are listed in Table 42.1.
·Histopathological demonstration of fungal hyphae or yeast
forms is usually necessary for confirmation of the
significance of isolates from deep mycotic infections. The
periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction or methenamine silver
impregnation can be used to demonstrate fungal elements in
tissue sections.

Differentiation of fungal species
The main morphological features used for differentiating
fungi implicated in mycotic diseases are presented in Table

In  addition,  molecular
and
 immunological
characterization of fungal pathogens is being developed for
species differentiation.
· The form of the sexual stage (teleomorph) is used for
assigning a fungus to a phylum (Table 42.2).
· Examination of sporing heads for conidial arrangement and
the type and morphology of spores may allow initial
differentiation. The presence of a mature sporangium
identifies the fungus as a zygomycete (Fig. 42.3).
·Features of vegetative hyphae which can be used for
differentiation include:
-- Presence or absence of septa
- Either hyaline (colourless) or dematiaceous (pigmented)
- Specific hyphal structures such as racquet-shaped and
spiral hyphae.
·Colonial characteristics:
- Size and appearance after specified incubation time
Colour of both obverse and reverse sides
1115
 Surface elevations or depressions
·Yeasts can be differentiated by colonial appearance and the
size and shape of individual cells. Biochemical reactions are
also used for differentiation.
· Dimorphic fungi grow as moulds when cultured on
Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25°C and as yeasts when
cultured on enriched media at 37°C.
· Soluble antigens produced by dimorphic fungi can be used
for identification in immunological tests.
· Specific nucleic acid probes have been developed for rapid
and reliable identification of dimorphic fungi.
·Molecular diagnostic methods, including PCR and specific
probes, are increasingly being applied for the identification
of specific fungal species. However, conventional methods
will remain important due to the large number of fungi in the
environment capable of causing disease.

Dermatophytes
The dermatophytes, a group of septate fungi which occur
worldwide, invade superficial keratinized structures such
as skin, hair and claws. More than 30 species of
dermatophytes are recognized in three anamorphic genera:
Microsporum,Trichophyton
Originally, dermatophytes were classified in the Fungi
Imperfecti.However, (
despite
their
 ecologica]  and
phenotypic variation, molecular studies have shown that
all dermatophytes are genetically closely related to each
other and are members of the family Arthrodermataceae in
the phylum Ascomycota. Several species have been shown
to be capable of reproducing sexually and have been
placed in the teleomorphic genus Arthroderma with dual
names referring to the anamorphic and teleomorphic
forms, respectively. The name of the anamorphic form
which is still the most widely recognized will be used in
this chapter. The species Epidermophyton floccosum is
primarily a human pathogen.
Arthrospores (arthroconidia) are the infectious forms most
often associated with tissue invasion by this group of
fungi. They are released by fragmentation of hyphae in
keratinized structures. These resistant forms can remain
viable for more than 12 months in suitable environments in
buildings. Dermatophytes are strict aerobes, most of which
grow slowly on standard Sabouraud dextrose agar. A few
require special growth factors which are supplied by the
addition of yeast extract to the Sabouraud dextrose agar.
1118
Macroconidia and microconidia are produced in culture.
The colonies of many dermatophytes are pigmented.
Colonial  morphology  and   the  type  of  macroconidia
produced are used for identification.

 Zoophilic and anthropophilic dermatophytes are
obligate pathogens; geophilic dermatophytes are
saprophytes in soil
 Cause characteristic circular skin lesions termed
ringworm
Dermatophytosis (ringworm) affects many animal species
(Table 43.1). The disease is a zoonosis and most human
infections are caused by Microsporum canis contracted
from infected cats (Pepin and Oxenham, 1986).
Usual habitat
Dermatophytes can be grouped on the basis of their
habitats and host preferences as geophilic, zoophilic or
anthropophilic (Table 43.2). Geophilic dermatophytes
inhabit and replicate in the soil in association with
1119
decomposing keratinous materials such as hairs or feathers
(Weitzman and Summerbell, 1995). Animals can acquire
infection with geophilic dermatophytes from soil or from
contact

· The colonial morphology of dermatophytes commonly
isolated from animals is described in Table 43.3. The
obverse and reverse of each colony should be examined
· Macroconidial morphology is assessed under low or high dry
magnification in preparations or transparent adhesive tape
mounts of colony samples stained with lactophenol cotton
blue (Figs 43.1, 43.2). Other structures such as spiral
hyphae, microconidia or chlamydospores can be used for
differentiation.
· Special growth requirements can be determined using
commercially available trichophyton agar. Control medium,
designated trichophyton agar 1 (T1), is a casein basal agar
Other media, produced by adding growth factors to the basal
agar, are T3 containing thiamine and inositol, T4 containing
only thiamine and T5 containing nicotinic acid.
Trichophyton verrucosum, which has a requirement for
thiamine and sometimes for inositol, usually grows on T3 or
T4 media.
 Trichophyton equinum requires nicotinic acid for growth
whereas T. equinum var. autotrophicum does not. Culture on
T1 and T5 media can be used to differentiate these variants.
-Trichophyton mentagrophytes hydrolyses urea when
grown on Christensen urea agar.
·Temperature tolerance tests are useful for differentiating T.
verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes, which grow well at
37°C, from other dermatophytes which do not tolerate this
temperature.
· In vitro hair perforation tests are sometimes used to
distinguish atypical isolates of T. mentagrophytes from T.
rubrum and atypical M. canis from T. equinum. Sterilized
blonde hairs from a child, placed on a culture of the
dermatophyte under test, are incubated at 25°C. The hairs,
stained with lactophenol cotton blue, are examined
microscopically   from  the    seventh   day   onwards.

this medium. Growth of dermatophytes results in alkaline
metabolic products and the colour of the medium changes to

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Dermatophytes invade keratinized structures such as the
stratum corneum of the epidermis, hair follicles, hair shafts
and feathers. Lesion development is influenced by the
virulence of the dermatophyte and the immunological
competence of the host. Young, aged, debilitated and
immunosuppressed animals are particularly susceptible to
infection, which occurs either directly by contact with an
infected host or indirectly through infected epithelial
debris in the environment. Infective arthrospores adhere to
keratinized structures and germinate within 6 hours. Minor
trauma such as gentle rubbing of the skin or bites from
arthropods may facilitate infection. Damp skin surfaces
and warmth favour germination of spores. Metabolic
products  of hyphal
1growth
1mayprovoke alocal
1125
inflammatory response. Hyphae grow centrifugally from
the initial lesion towards normal skin, producing typical
ringworm lesions. Alopecia, tissue repair and nonviable
hyphae are found at the centres of lesions as they develop
Growth of hyphae can result in epidermal hyperplasia and
hyperkeratosis.  Secondary bacterial infection  sometimes
follows mycotic folliculitis
The development of a strong cell-mediated response
correlates with the onset of a delayed-type hypersensitivity
which usually results in elimination of the dermatophyte,
resolution of the lesion and local resistance to reinfection.
Immunity to dermatophytosis is transient and reinfection
may occur if the challenge dose is large (Moriello and De
Boer, 1995). Other mechanisms which may be associated
with the elimination of infection include an increased rate
of desquamation from the stratum corneum and an increase
in the permeability of the epidermis allowing penetration
of inflammatory fluids (Wagner and Sohnle, 1995)
Animals with ringworm developantibodies
against
dermatophyte glycoprotein antigens. Antibody- mediated
responses do not appear to be protective. Strong humoral
immune-mediated   responses  and   weak  cell-mediated
responses have been demonstrated in persistently infected
cats (Moriello and DeBoer, 1995)
Diagnostic procedures
Laboratory investigation of dermatophytosis is often
necessary because diagnosis on clinical grounds can be
difficult.

the animal species affected may indicate the dermatophyte
most likely to be involved ( Table 43.1).
·Specimens suitable for laboratory examination include
scrapings from affected claws, and biopsy material from
pseudomycetomas. Suitable material from cats can also be
collected on a large sheet of paper by brushing the coat with
a clean toothbrush
· Hairs and skin scrapings treated with KOH should be
examined microscopically for the presence of arthrospores.
The arrangement of arthrospores on hair shafts is typically
ectothrix (Fig. 43.4). Mites, such as Demodex species, may
also be detected in these specimens.
· Histological sections of skin or pseudomycetomas can be
stained by the PAS or methenamine silver techniques to
demonstrate fungal structures.
· Specimens are cultured on Emmon's Sabouraud dextrose
agar (pH 6.9) with the addition of 2 to 4% yeast extract,
0.05g/litre chloramphenicol and 0.4 g/litre cycloheximide.

and examined twice weekly for up to 5 weeks.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
-Colonialmorphology
- Microscopic appearance of macroconidia
- Supplementary tests including growth on DTM medium.
· Several DNA-based techniques have been developed for the
identification of isolated fungi and for the detection of
fungal DNA in dermatological specimens (Nardoni et af.,
2007;Kanbe,2008)
 [n cats and dogs with suspicious lesions, examination with
Wood's lamp should always be carried out because M. canis
infections are comparatively common in these species. A
characteristic apple-green fluorescence from infected hairs is
evident in more than 50% of affected dogs and cats (Sparkes
1127
et af., 1993). Detection of fluorescence depends on factors
such as stage of infection and the characteristics of the
infecting strain. In cats with inapparent infections, hairs
should be cultured.
· Laboratory investigations to exclude other pathogens which
cause skin conditions should be considered.

Clinical infections
Dermatophytosis  is a comparatively  common  clinical
condition in both companion and farm animals. Because of
the zoonotic nature of the dermatophytoses, affected
animals should be handled with care.
Dermatophytosis in cats and dogs
Most infections in cats are caused by M. canis. Clinical
features of the disease include classical ringworm lesions,
miliary
  dermatitis, pseudomycetomas (Medleau 
and
Rakich, 1994), onychomycosis and, rarely, generalized
lesionsin immunosuppressed
animals.   Inapparent
infections are known to occur and cats may also carry
arthrospores physically in their coats (Moriello et al.,
1994). Persian cats appear  to have a heritable
predisposition and  may  present  with  mycetoma-like
1128
lesions. The dermatophytes which commonly affect dogs
are listed in Box 43.1. The disease usually presents as
areas of alopecia, scaling and broken hairs surrounded by
inflammatory zones. Less commonly encountered lesions
include folliculitis and onychomycosis. Lesion distribution
on the muzzle may relate to certain behavioural activities
such as compulsive digging in soil, rat-catching and
attacking hedgehogs. These activities often determine the
species of dermatophyte involved in the infection, for
example T. mentagrophytes var. erinacei is usually
acquired from hedgehogs and M. gypseum from the soil.
Generalized infection is uncommon in dogs and is often

and immunosuppression.

·Microsporum canis
·M.gypseum
·Trichophyton mentagrophytes

Treatment and control
Because the dermatophytoses are zoonoses, treatment and
control are particularly important in domestic carnivores.
·If lesions are limited in extent, treatment with preparations
such as lime sulphur or miconazole shampoo may be
effective (Moriello and De Boer, 1995). A solution of 0.2%
enilconazole is approved in most countries for use in dogs,
cats, horses and cattle.
1129
· Clipping of the haircoat is advisable, particularly if lesions
are extensive. The clippings, which contain numerous
in fective arthrospores, must be disposed of carefully.
· Itraconazole, fluconazole or terbinafine, administered orally,
are the drugs of choice for systemic therapy. Because they
are potentially teratogenic, azole drugs should not be given
many years for the treatment of dermatophytosis, it is used
less frequently because of the risks of teratogenicity. In
be given to cats  with feline immunodeficiency  virus
infection.
·Animals with suspicious lesions should be isolated.
·Early laboratory confirmation is essential.
·[n-contact animals should be examinedunder aWood's
lamp and closely monitored for skin lesions.
·Contaminated areas should be vacuum-cleaned to remove
infected skin debris and hairs.
· Contaminated bedding should be burnt and grooming
equipment should be disinfected with 0.5% sodium
hypochlorite.
·A number of vaccines for use in dogs and cats have been
 produced over the years but a vaccine of proven efficacy still
appears to be lacking (Lund and DeBoer, 2008).
Dermatophytosis in cattle
Trichophyton verrucosum is the usual cause of ringworm
in cattle. Calves are affected most commonly and often
develop characteristic lesions on the face and around the
eyes. In heifers and cows, lesions may be present on the
neck and limbs. Oval areas of affected skin are alopecic
with greyish white crusts. Infection is most common in
winter months, with a number of animals usually affected.
Bovine dermatophytosis is usually self-limiting. However,
individual valuable animals may require treatment. Topical
1130
preparations such as 5% lime sulphur, captan (1:300) or
natamycin may be effective. Individual lesions can be
treated with fluconazole, itraconazole or terbinafine
Commercial vaccines containing an attenuated strain of T.
   (    o
successfully for the control of bovine dermato- phytosis in
Europe and Russia (Gordon and Bond, 1996 ; Lund and
DeBoer, 2008).
Dermatophytosis in horses
Trichophyton equinum is the main cause of ringworm in
horses.Trichophyton equinum var. autotrophicum is a
variety that lacks the requirement for nicotinic acid and
although relatively specific for the horse is uncommon and
is limited   in  geographical  distribution.  Microsporum
equinum, now considered to be identical to M. canis
(Graser et al., 2000), occurs from time to time in young
horses. Transmission occurs by direct contact or from
contaminated harness and grooming gear. The distribution
of the skin lesions may indicate the likely source of the
infection. Lesions may be limited to the girth strap or
saddle regions or may be widely distributed if grooming
gear is contaminated. Infection caused by M. gypseum can
be acquired from rolling in soil, with lesions usually
confined to the dorsum. Trichophyton mentagrophytes is
occasionally isolated from horses, and T. verrucosum
infections may be acquired from contact with infected
cattle. Horses under 4 years of age are particularly
susceptible to dermatophytosis. Treatment with topical
preparations such as 5% lime sulphur, natamycin or azole
compounds is usually effective. Affected animals must be
isolated and contaminated harness and grooming gear
1131
should be disinfected with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. In
some European countries, vaccination is used to prevent
transmission of infection in groups of animals (Lund and
DeBoer, 2008).
Dermatophytosis in pigs
Dermatophytosis in pigs is uncommon and is usually
caused by M. nanum. The condition, which can be
endemic in a herd, may not be recognized, particularly in
pigs with pigmented skin (Ginther, 1965). All ages are
susceptible and lesions can occur anywhere on the body
surface as thick brownish crusts. Ringworm in pigs is not
of economic importance.
Favus in poultry
Gallinaceous birds are occasionally infected with M.
gallinae, the cause of avian ringworm or favus. White
patchy crusts develop on the comb and wattles. If the
disease is severe, feather follicles may be invaded and
affected birds may show signs of systemic illness.

Aspergillus species
Among the saprophytic moulds, Aspergillus species are
widely distributed. Although the genus contains more than
190 species, only a limited number of these have been
implicated in opportunistic  infections in  animals and
humans. Aspergillus fumigatus is the species most often
S  s     
niger, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. deflectus, A. nidulans and A.
flavipes. Aspergillus species are members of the phylum
Ascomycota. The teleomorph or sexual stage is not known
for many
Aspergillus species. Recently, the sexual
reproductive cycle

demonstrated and the teleomorph Neosartorya fumigata
was described (O'Gorman et al., 2008). The hyphae are
septate, hyaline and up to 8.0 μm in diameter. Unbranched
conidiophores develop at right angles from specialized
hyphal foot cells. The tip of the conidiophore enlarges to
form a vesicle which becomes partially or completely
covered with flask-shaped phialides. The phialides produce
chains of round pigmented conidia (phialoconidia) which
may be smooth or rough and are up to 5.0 μm in diameter
(Fig. 44.1). Aspergilli are aerobic and grow rapidly.
forming distinct colonies after incubation for 2 to 3 days.
The colour of the obverse side of colonies, which may be
bluish green, black, brown, yellow or reddish, varies with
individual species and with cultural conditions. Aspergillus
fumigatus, a thermotolerant species, grows at temperatures
ranging from 20°C to 50°C.

Respiratory infections may occur following inhalation of
spores. Less commonly, infection can result from ingestion
of spores or following tissue trauma. Systemic infection is
invariably associated with immunosuppression. Species
such as A. flavus, which elaborate potent toxins when
growing in cereals and other foods, cause mycotoxicosis
(see Chapter 51)
Usual habitat
Aspergilli are common soil inhabitants and are also found
in  large numbers in decomposing
organic  matter.
Aspergillus fumigatus often occurs in overheated, poor
quality hay and in compost heaps. Spores of Aspergillus
species are present in dust and air.

Recognition of Aspergillus species
Aspergillus species grow on standard laboratory media
such as Sabouraud dextrose agar. Because the genus
contains a large number of species, differentiation is
difficult. A small number of the species are responsible for
the majority of infections in animals and a presumptive
identification may be made on the basis of colonial
appearance and the conidial arrangement on sporing heads
 Colonies can be up to 5 cm in diameter after incubation for 5
days. The colour of the reverse side is pale yellow to light
tan. The colour of the obverse side is determined by the
pigmentation of the conidia:
-A.fumigatus colonies rapidly become velvety or granular
and bluish green with narrow white peripheries. Older
colonies are slate grey.
- A. niger colonies are black and granular, features imparted
by their large pigmented sporing heads
1137
- A. flavus colonies are yellowish green with a fluffy texture.
- A. terreus colonies are cinnamon brown with a granular
texture.
·Sporing heads, stained with lactophenol cotton blue and
examined with low and high dry magnification, have
characteristic features. These include size and shape of
vesicles, position of phialides, and the size, shape and colour
of conidia. Differentiating features of A. fumigatus and A.
niger sporing heads are illustrated in Fig. 44.1.
· Because their colonies can be similar in appearance,
microscopic differentiation of A. fumigatus from some
Penicillium species may be necessary. The conidiophores of
Penicillium species often possess  secondary
branches
(metulae), bearing several phialides (Fig. 44.2).
 For definitive identification it may be necessary to induce
and examine the teleomorphic form of an Aspergillus isolate,
a procedure carried out in reference laboratories.

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Infection with Aspergillus species, mainly A. fumigatus,
has been recorded in many species of animals.
Aspergillosis, which is primarily a respiratory infection,
follows spore inhalation. Because
the spores of A.
1138
fumigatus are small, they can pass through the upper
respiratory tract and may be carried to the terminal parts of
the bronchial tree (Amitani et al., 1995). Germination of
inhaled spores and hyphal invasion of tissues depend on a
number of factors. A true virulence factor has not been
demonstrated but rather a number of factors appear to
combine to facilitate disease production (Tomee and
Kauffman, 2000). Aspergillus spores adhere to collagen,
fibrinogen,  fibronectin
  and 
laminin.Pathogenic
Aspergillus species grow well at 37°C and produce a wide
variety of extracellular enzymes. Proteases with elastase,
fibrinolytic and anticoagulative properties are considered
to be important. In addition, a metabolite of A. fumigatus,
gliotoxin, inhibits both the activity
ofciliaand
phagocytosis by macrophages.
Immune competence of the host largely determines the
outcome of infection. Factors that may modify immune
competence include corticosteroid therapy and long-term
treatment with antimicrobial drugs. Interference with both
neutrophil and monocyte function may predispose to tissue
invasion.  Hyphal invasion  of blood vessels leads to
vasculitis and thrombus formation. Mycotic granulomas
may develop in the lungs and occasionally in other internal
organs.
Diagnostic procedures
· Certain specific clinical conditions such as guttural pouch
mycosis may suggest the involvement of Aspergillus species.
Endoscopic examination can be used to detect lesions in the
nasal cavity and guttural pouch.
1139
·For confirmation of aetiological involvement, tissue invasion
tissues taken at post-mortem, and Aspergillus species must
be isolated from specimens.
·Tissue sections stained by methenamine silver or by the PAS
method may reveal hyphal invasion.
· For isolation, small tissue specimens are applied to the
scarified surface of Sabouraud dextrose agar and incubated
aerobically at 37°C for 2 to 5 days. Hyphae grow from
specimens forming colonies.
· Identification criteria:
- Colonial morphology
- Appearance of sporing heads including conidia (Fig. 44.1)
- Growth at 45°C to 50°C (thermotolerant species).
· Molecular procedures, such as the polymerase chain reaction
technique, are being developed to detect A. fumigatus in
clinical specimens (Spreadbury et af., 1993; O'Sullivan et
al., 2003; Peeters et af., 2008).
·Serological tests are based on growth phase or
hyphal-specific antigens of A. fumigatus. As a consequence
of constant exposure, most animals develop antibodies to
conidial antigens and serological results must be interpreted
with caution. In dogs, the most sensitive serological test is
considered to be the ELISA. A commercial human ELISA
that detects a cell wall component, β-1,3-D-glucan, in blood
and bronchoalveolar lavage samples has been applied with
some success to avian serum samples (Cray et af., 2009).
Clinical infections
Clinical
cases   of  aspergillosis   are   comparatively
uncommon and usually sporadic. Birds appear to be more
susceptible  to aspergillosis  than mammals and  this
susceptibility has been attributed to differences in innate
1140
and

mammalian  species.

Brooder pneumonia in young chickens
This disease affects newly hatched chickens which are
exposed to high numbers of A. fumigatus spores. Affected
chickens develop somnolence and inappetence, and many
die. Yellowish nodules are present in the lungs, air sacs
and, occasionally, in
1other organs. Histopathological
evidence of tissue invasion by fungi and culture of A.
fumigatus from lesions are required for confirmation. Strict
hygiene and routine fumigation of incubators are effective
control measures.
Aspergillosis in mature birds
1142
Infection in mature birds frequently follows inhalation of
spore-laden dust derived from contaminated litter or feed.
Poultry and captive penguins, raptors and psittacine birds
may be affected. Penguins are susceptible to infection if
kept at unsuitably high ambient temperatures, whereas
infection in raptors has been attributed to A. fiumigatus
spores from shredded wood bark on aviary floors. Clinical
signs, which are variable, include dyspnoea and
emaciation. Yellowish nodules resembling lesions of avian
tuberculosis can be observed in the lungs and air sacs.
Dissemination may  occur  to other  internal  organs.
Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathology and culture.
Guttural pouch mycosis
This condition, which is frequently associated with
Aspergillus species infection, particularly A. fumigatus, is
usually unilateral (Ludwig et al., 2005). Lesions, often
plaque-like, develop in the mucosa of the pouch wall.
When fungal hyphae penetrate to deeper tissues, they
cause tissue necrosis, thrombosis, erosion of blood vessel
walls and neural damage. The clinical signs include
epistaxis,dysphagia
a   and   laryngeal  hemiplegia.
Postauricular swelling and unilateral nasal discharge may
follow accumulation of inflammatory exudates in the
pouch. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, radiographic
evidence of fluid accumulation in the pouch and
demonstration of characteristic lesions by endoscopy.
Confirmation is based on demonstration of fungal hyphae
in biopsy specimens and isolation of A. fumigatus from
lesions. Therapeutic options include infusion of antifungal
agents such as itraconazole into the pouch and surgical
intervention to deal with serious haemorrhage. Oral or
1143
systemic antifungal therapy is used infrequently because of
potential toxicity and excessive cost.
Nasal aspergillosis in dogs
Canine nasal aspergillosis is encountered in young to
middle-aged dolichocephalic breeds. Clinical signs, which
are
often
unilateral,  include  persistent,  profuse
sanguinopurulent nasal discharge with sneezing and bouts
of epistaxis. Radiography may reveal an increased
radiolucency of turbinate bones. Serology may suggest
aspergillosis (Billen et al., 2009) but culture and
histopathological  examination of biopsy material are
essential for confirmation.
Administration  of itraconazole  through  tubes inserted
surgically in the frontal sinuses and nasal chambers may be
used together with systemic treatment with fluconazole or
voriconazole which should continue for 6 to 8 weeks.
Mycotic abortion in cows
This  form of abortion occurs sporadically and its
prevalence
may
　be　influenced
1  by poor   quality
contaminated fodder harvested in wet seasons. Aspergillus
fumigatus can proliferate in damp hay, in poor quality
silage and in brewers’ grains. Infection, which reaches the
uterus haematogenously, causes placentitis leading to
abortion late in gestation. Affected cows usually show no
signs of systemic illness. Intercotyledonary areas of the
placenta are thickened and leathery and the cotyledons are
necrotic. Aborted foetuses may have raised cutaneous
plaques resembling ringworm lesions. Diagnosis is based
1144
on culture of A. fumigatus from foetal abomasal contents
and histopathological evidence of mycotic placentitis.

Yeasts and disease production
Yeasts are eukaryotic, round or oval, single-celled
organisms. During asexual reproduction, blastoconidia,
also referred to as buds or daughter cells, develop.
Blastoconidia, produced linearly without separation, may
elongate to form a pseudohypha. Yeasts, such as Candida
or  when growing deeply
y in agar media. Yeasts grow
aerobically on Sabouraud dextrose agar, and the species
capable of tissue invasion grow well at 37?C. Colonies,
which are usually moist and creamy in texture, resemble
large bacterial colonies. Formerly, yeasts were classified as
Fungi Imperfecti. Based on demonstration of a teleomorph
or by utilizing sequencing data, the genera of veterinary
importance have been placed in either phylum Ascomycota
(Candida, Macrorhabdus and Geotrichum) or phylum
Basidiomycota
(Cryptococcus,
Malassezia
and
Trichosporon)
Yeasts are found in the environment, often on plants or
the skin or mucous membranes of animals. They cause
opportunistic  infections 
which
are
categorized
as
exogenous, when derived from the environment, or
endogenous, when resulting
from  overgrowth
of
commensals. Immunosuppression or factors such as
prolonged antimicrobial therapy which disturb the resident
flora on mucosal surfaces may facilitate yeast overgrowth
leading to tissue invasion. Yeasts of importance in animal

disease are Candida species (particularly C. albicans),
Cryptococcus neoformans and Malassezia pachydermatis.

animal disease. It grows aerobically at 37°C on a wide
range of media including Sabouraud dextrose agar.
Colonies  are
e composedof   buddingoval cells
approximately 5.0 × 8.0 μm. In animal tissues, C. albicans
may exhibit polymorphism in the form of pseudohyphae or
hyphae (Fig. 45.1). On certain media, it characteristically
produces    thick-walled    resting
cells
kmown  as
chlamydospores (chlamydoconidia).
Usual habitat
Candida species occur worldwide on plant materials and.
as commensals, in the digestive and urogenital tracts of
animals and humans. Candida albicans is isolated from
environmental sources less frequently than other Candida
species, suggesting adaptation towards a parasitic rather
than a saprophytic existence.
Differentiation of Candida species
·Most Candida species have a similar colonial appearance.
Colonies, which are whitish, shiny and convex, are 4 to 5
mm in diameter after incubation for 3 days.
· Subculturing on to an indicator medium allows presumptive
identification of C. albicans, C. krusei and C. tropicalis on
the basis of colonial appearance (Odds and Bernaerts, 1994).
· Carbohydrate assimilation and fermentation tests, which are
usually performed in reference laboratories, allow definitive
species identification
·Commercially available biochemical test kits, giving results

Features of C. aibicans used for presumptive identification
include:
- Growth at 37°C
- Production of chlamydospores in submerged cultures on
cornmeal agar (Fig. 45.2)
- Production of germ tubes within 2 hours when incubated in
serum at 37°C (Fig. 45.3)

Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
1152
Candida albicans, the principal yeast involved in animal
disease, possesses a number of putative virulence factors
(Cutler, 1991). The organism has surface integrin-like
molecules which allow adhesion to matrix proteins. In
addition, surface structures can bind fibrinogen and
complement components. Production of proteases and
phospholipases may aid tissue  invasion.   Phenotypic
switching and biofilm formation, which have been
demonstrated in C. albicans, may facilitate evasion of host
defence mechanisms.
During the early stages of infection, phagocytic clearance
mechanisms eliminate most of the yeast cells. Cells that
         s
transition  from budding  to hyphal forms probably
facilitates tissue penetration and increases resistance to
phagocytosis due to the larger size of the hyphae.
enhance invasiveness. The localized mucocutaneous form
of candidiasis is
associated with overgrowth of resident C. albicans in the
oral   cavity  or   gastrointestinal  and   urogenital  tracts.
Predisposing  factors  include  defects  in cell-mediated
immunity, concurrent disease, disturbance of the normal
flora by prolonged use of antimicrobial drugs and damage
to the mucosa from indwelling catheters. Affected mucosa
 is thickened and often hyperaemic.
Haematogenous spread may occur following  vascular
invasion by hyphae or pseudohyphae, producing systemic
lesions.
Diagnostic procedures
1153
· Suitable specimens for culture and histopathology include
biopsy or post-mortem tissue samples and milk samples.
· Tissue sections, stained by PAS or methenamine silver
methods, may reveal budding yeast cells or hyphae.
· Culture is carried out aerobically at 37°C for 2 to 5 days on
Sabouraud dextrose agar, with or without cycloheximide.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
- Characteristic colonies yielding budding yeast cells.
- Growth on media containing cycloheximide (specific for
C. albicans)
- Colonial appearance on CHROMagar Candida.
- Biochemical profile.
- Chlamydospore and germ tube production (specific for C.
albicans).
Molecular techniques have been used for the identification
of Candida species in clinical veterinary samples but are not
routinely applied (Kano et al., 2002).
Clinical infections
Opportunistic infections with Candida species, which
occur  sporadically,  are  usually
 associated
1with
immunosuppression or the prolonged use of antimicrobial
drugs. The  clinical  conditions attributed  to Candida
species are presented in Table 45.1. Overgrowth of
commensal  Candida  species  may   result  in  localized
mucosal damage in parts of the digestive or urogenital
tracts.
Thrush of the oesophagus or crop in young chickens may
be associated with prolonged antibiotic administration,
1154
debilitating conditions such as intestinal coccidiosis, or
unsanitary, overcrowded housing conditions. Mycotic
stomatitis has been reported in pups, kittens and foals
(McClure et al., 1985). Candida albicans has been
implicated in gastro-oesophageal ulceration in pigs and
foals (Kadel et al., 1969; Gross and Mayhew, 1985).
Rarely, disseminated candidiasis may occur in pigs, calves,
dogs and cats.

albicans.

Disseminated disease
Bovine abortion caused by Candida species has been
recorded (Foley and Schlafer, 1987). In addition, a number
of Candida species have been isolated from cases of
bovine mastitis (Richard et al., 1980). Mycotic mastitis
occurs  sporadically  either as  a  consequence
of
contaminated intramammary preparations or from heavy
environmental contamination (Elad et al., 1995). Usually
1155
one quarter is involved and spontaneous elimination of the
infection frequently occurs. Rarely, yeast cells may be
shed for up to 12 months.
Cryptococcus species
Although the genus Cryptococcus contains more than 30
recognized
 species, only C. neoformans produces
opportunistic infections. On the basis of polysaccharide
capsular antigens, five serotypes of C. neoformans are
recognized (A, B, C, D and AD hybrid). Originally two
variants of C. neoformans were described, C. neoformans
var. neoformans (serotypes A, D and AD) and C.
neoformans var. gattii (serotypes B and C). However, two
morphologically   distinct
teleomorphs,Filobasidiella
neoformans and F. bacillispora, produced by these two
variants have been demonstrated and C. gattii is now
considered a separate species. In addition, significant
genetic variations have been shown between serotypes A
and D resulting in the recognition of serotype A as a
separate variant, C. neoformans var. grubii. Currently, C.
neoformans is considered to be a species complex
consisting of two variants, C. neoformans var. grubii (A),
C. neoformans var. neoformans (D) and subspecies C. gatii
(B, C). Based on genetic analysis, nine molecular types
       
further taxonomic refinements are expected. The majority
of infections in humans, which occur predominantly in
immunocompromised individuals, are associated with C.
neoformans var. grubii.

mother cell and its bud. Prominent mucopolysaccharide
capsules are a characteristic feature of this yeast.
The yeast cells are round to oval and 3.5 to 8.0 μm in
diameter. A daughter cell is formed as a bud, on a narrow
neck, from the mother cell. When recovered directly from
affected
animals, 
the  yeasts
have  thick
mucopolysaccharide capsules which can be demonstrated
in India ink preparations (Fig. 45.4). The capsules can also
be observed in tissue sections stained with mucicarmine.
Cryptococcus species
 are  aerobic, 1
 non-fermentative
organisms which form mucoid colonies on a variety of
media including Sabouraud dextrose agar. The ability to
grow at 37°C distinguishes C. neoformans from other
Cryptococcus species. Filamentous forms (hyphae and
pseudohyphae) have been described but are rare. On
basidiospores may be important infectious forms.
The clinical conditions caused by C. neoformans in
domestic animals are presented in Table 45.2.
1157
Usual habitat
Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans
var. neoformans can be isolated from the droppings of
pigeons and other birds and from soil enriched by these
droppings. Creatinine, present in the droppings, is utilized
by this yeast. Pigeons with C. neoformans in their
intestinal tracts can excrete the organism for several
months without developing disease.

Laboratory recognition of C. neoformans
Colonies of Cryptococcus species, which are mucoid when
first isolated due to the presence of capsular material,
become dry with age. They may have a cream, tan or
yellowish appearance.
·Budding yeasts with wide capsules can be demonstrated in
[ndia ink preparations (Fig. 45.4).
· Most Cryptococcus species
produce urease, rapidly
hydrolysing urea to ammonia.
1158
· Differentiation of species is possible using carbohydrate
assimilation tests or commercially available biochemical
kits.
· Identification criteria for C. neoformans:
- Ability to grow at 37°℃
- Brown colonies on birdseed agar as a result of phenol
oxidase production
Melanin demonstrable in cell walls using the
Masson-Fontana stain on tissue sections.
Cryptococcus gattii can utilize glycine as the sole source of
nitrogen and is resistant to canavanine. In contrast,
Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans
var. neoformans cannot utilize glycine as a sole source of
nitrogen and are susceptible to canavanine.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Infection occurs through inhalation of C. neoformans cells
in contaminated dust. Some yeast cells may be trapped in
the nasal cavities or sinuses, while others are deposited in
the lungs. Virulence factors of C. neoformans include the
capsule, which is antiphagocytic, the ability to grow at
mammalian  body temperature and  the  production  of
phenol oxidase. Mutants that have lost one of these
attributes are avirulent. The virulence arising from phenol
oxidase activity may relate to the degradation of
catecholamine which
results in the accumulation of melanin in the yeast cell
walls protecting against the toxic effects of free radicals
Jacobson    and
dEmery，1991)．Productionof
phospholipases, involved in membrane disruption during
tissue invasion, is also thought to be an important
1159
virulence factor. Phenotypic switching has been described
for C. neoformans (Jain and Fries, 2008).
Immunocompetent
animals can mount an effective
cell-mediated response to C. neoformans. Dissemination
from the respiratory tract to brain, meninges, skin and
bones is usually associated with defective cellmediated
immunity. Lesions  associated with C. neoformans
infection range from discrete granulomas to tumour-like
myxomatous masses composed of yeast cells in a
connective tissue matrix. Small granulomas may be
present in the lungs of clinically normal animals.
Diagnostic procedures
Care must be exercised when handling material from
suspect C. neoformans cases because of the risk of
acquiring infection.
· Suitable specimens for laboratory examination  include
exudates, cerebrospinal fluid and biopsy or post-mortem
tissues.
·Budding yeasts with characteristic, thick capsules can be
demonstrated in fluid samples using India ink preparations
(Fig. 45.4).
· In tissue sections, yeast capsules are demonstrated by
Mayer's mucicarmine method. Melanin can be detected in
cell walls of C. neoformans by the Masson-Fontana
technique.
· Specimens, cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar with
chloramphenicol but without cyclohexamide, are incubated
aerobically at 37°C for up to 2 weeks.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
- Mucoid colonies

infection, can be used on samples of cerebrospinal fluid,

been described (Kano et af., 2001)
Clinical infections
Apart from sporadic cases in cats and dogs, cryptococcosis
in domestic animals is relatively rare (Table 45.2). In
companion animals, clinical signs of cryptococcosis
usually relate to the nasal cavity or skin involvement. The
disease in dogs, which is less common than in cats, is often
disseminated with neurological and ocular signs (Jergens
et al., 1986). Cryptococcosis has been recorded
infrequently  in horses. Clinical signs include nasal
granulomas and sinusitis (Scott et al., 1974), pneumonia
(Hilbert et al., 1980), meningoen- cephalitis and abortion
(Blanchard and Filkins, 1992). Cryptococcus neoformans
is a rare cause of mastitis in dairy cattle. Avian
cryptococcosis has occasionally been described (Malik et
al., 2003).
Feline cryptococcosis
Nasal,
 cutaneous,
neuralandocular formsof
cryptococcosis are recognized in cats. The nasal form,
1161
which accounts for approximately 70% of cases, is
characterized by flesh-coloured, polyp-like granulomas in
the nasal cavity. Cutaneous lesions, often affecting the
face, head and neck, are reported in about 30% of cases.
Peripheral  lymphadenopathy  is common.  Neurological
signs are evident in about 25% of cases and, in some
instances, chorioretinitis may be evident.
Surgical  removal  combined  with  parenteral  antifungal
drugs is the usual method for treating cutaneous
cryptococcosis. There may be a favourable response to
amphotericin B with flucytosine or to ketoconazole.
itraconazole or fluconazole (Medleau et al., 1990; Malik et
αl., 1992). Therapy should continue for at least 2 months
The latex agglutination test can be used to monitor the
effects of antifungal therapy and declining capsular antigen
levels indicate a favourable response to treatment
(Medleau et al., 1990).
Malassezia pachydermatis
Malassezia species, commensals on the skin of animals
and humans, are aerobic, non-fermentative, urease-
positive yeasts which grow at 35°C to 37°C. There are 11
species recognized currently in the genus (M. equi, found
          
recognized). All species, with the exception of M.
pachydermatis, are lipid-dependent on account of an
inability to synthesize C14 or C16 fatty acids de novo
(Ashbee, 2007). One species in particular, Malassezia
pachydermatis (formerlyPityrosporum canis)is of
veterinary importance. The cells of M. pachydermatis,
   o n  pa n -aq  i
1162
length, reproduce by monopolar budding on a broad base
Multiple budding may occur from the same site on a
mother cell. After repeated budding, a distinct collarette
forms at this site (Fig. 45.5). Pseudohyphae may be
produced infrequently in tissues (Guillot et al., 1998).
Figure 45.5 Bottle-shaped cells of the yeast, Malassezia
pachydermatis. Monopolar budding on a broad base, with
the formation of a prominent collarette, is a characteristic
of this yeast.
Usualhabitat
Malassezia pachydermatis can be found on the skin of
mammals and birds, particularly in areas rich in sebaceous
glands. The anal region, external ear canal, lips and
interdigital skin of dogs are frequently colonized by this
yeast (Bond et al., 1995b). Three lipid-dependent species,
M. furfur, M. globosa and M. sympodialis, have been
isolated from healthy cats. In many instances, mixed
cultures containing two or even three Malassezia species,
M. pachydermatis, M. furfur and M. sympodialis, are
recovered from canine and feline specimens (Raabe et al.,
1998).
Identification of Malassezia pachydermatis
· The unique budding pattern is demonstrable in microscopic
preparations stained with methylene blue.
1163
·Malassezia pachydermatis is the only member of the genus
which grows on Sabouraud dextrose agar without lipid
supplementation. Colonies, which are dull, opaque and
cream- coloured, have a smooth surface.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Malassezia pachydermatis is an opportunist and, in dogs,
has been associated with two clinical conditions, otitis
externa and dermatitis. Colonization and growth of the
organism in these locations may be associated with
immunosuppression and other predisposing factors which
alter the microclimate of the skin or ear canal. The yeast
cells produce sebum-altering lipases and when present in
high numbers they apparently induce excessive sebaceous
secretion, a feature of seborrhoeic dermatitis (Akerstedt
and Vollset, 1996). Zymogens in the yeast cell wall can
activate the complement cascade leading to damage to
keratinocytes, inflammation and pruritus. In otitis externa,
the production
of
proteolytic
enzymes
by  M
pachydermatis results in damage to the mucosa of the ear
canal. Excessive production and retention of wax, a
consequenceof
  ceruminous   gland  hypersecretion,
combined with the activity of M. pachydermatis and other
microorganisms, contribute to inflammatory changes.
Inflammatory exudate and necrotic debris accumulate in
the canal.
Genetic characterization of M. pachydermatis isolates
indicates that up to four different genetic types occur.
While a single genetic type predominates, the other three
types have been isolated only from the ear canals of dogs
(Aizawa et al., 200l; Castella et al., 2005).
1164
Diagnostic procedures
Involvement of M. pachydermatis should be considered in
otitis  externa  and
incanine seborrhoeic dermatitis.
Cytological examination is the most useful technique for
assessing increases in populations of M. pachydermatis.
Small numbers of yeast cells may not be significant and as a
general guide the finding of one or more organisms per
oil-immersion field in association with clinical signs can be
considered significant (Chen and Hill, 2005).
·Exudate from affected ear canals should be submitted for
laboratory examination.
· Clear adhesive strips pressed on to skin lesions several
times, impression smears, vigorous swabbing of the skin
surface or superficial skin scraping may be used to collect
suitable material for staining and examination for yeast cells.
In severe dermatitis, biopsy of skin may be considered.
· Characteristic yeast cells are demonstrable in exudates
stained with methylene blue (Fig. 45.5).
·Malassezia pachydermatis can be cultured aerobically at
37°C for 3 to 4 days on Sabouraud dextrose agar containing
chloramphenicol. Dixon's agar, a lipid- supplemented agar,
supports the growth of both M. pachydermatis and the
lipid-dependent Malassezia species.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
 Colonial appearance
- Growth without lipid supplementation (consistent with M.
pachydermatis)
- Characteristic microscopic appearance
 Molecular methods are available for the differentiation of
Malassezia species (Mirhendi et al., 2005)
· In otitis externa, blood agar and MacConkey agar plates
       
pathogens aetiologically associated with M. pachydermatis.
1165
Clinical infections
Malassezia pachydermatis has been implicated in canine
seborrhoeic  dermatitis and also  in skin  infections
secondary to epidermal dysplasia, a genetic disorder of
West Highland terriers (Akerstedt and Vollset, 1996). This
yeast is one of many organisms which may
contribute to otitis externa in dogs. The condition occurs
infrequently in cats
M. sympodialis has also been associated with otitis in cats,
while M. pachydermatis has been linked to feline chin
acne. Malassezia species isolated from cattle with otitis
include M. globosa, M. sympodialis, M. fiurfur and M.
slooffiae.
Canine seborrhoeic dermatitis
Factors that predispose to canine seborrhoeic dermatitis
include hypersensitivity disorders, keratinization defects,
immunosuppression and persistently moist skin folds.
Lesions tend to occur more frequently and with greater
severity in skin folds. Pruritus and erythema are
accompanied by a foul-smelling, greasy exudate with
matting of hair. Concurrent bilateral otitis externa may be
present(Bond et al.,  1995b). Treatment with
miconazole-chlorhexidine shampoo (Bond et al., 1995a)
or a combination of topical and oral ketoconazole may be
effective.
Canine otitis externa
1166
Otitis externa is characterized by a dark pungent discharge
from the ear canal and intense pruritis with head shaking,
scratching and rubbing of the ears. Damage to the pinna
may manifest as a haematoma. The mucosa of the ear
 o       
condition is complex.
.Poor ear conformation,wax
retention and immunosuppression are among the factors
that may predispose dogs to the disease. Malassezid
pachydermatis, which is present in low numbers in the ear
canal of clinically normal dogs, may proliferate in otitis
externa. Predisposing causes should be investigated and
eliminated or treated (Little. 1996). The fungal and
bacterial pathogens causing the  inflammatory response
should be identified by microscopic examination and
culture of aural exudate. Antibiotic susceptibility testing
should be carried out on the bacterial isolates prior to
initiating therapy. Proprietary ear drops, containing drugs
effective against the bacteria and fungi usually involved
and also against Otodectes cynotis, may be beneficial. In
chronic cases, surgical intervention may be required.
Megabacteria'(Macrorhabdusornithogaster)
Megabacteria’ are large (20 to 50 x 3.0μm) Gram-
glands of the lower portion of the proventriculus in
budgerigars with megabacteriosis, a chronic wasting
disease. They are also found in the proventriculus of
clinically normal budgerigars (Baker, 1997). Initially
believed to be a bacterium, phylogenetic analysis of
sequences of the 18S rDNA and 26S rDNA has shown the
organism to be an anamorphic ascomycetous yeast. The
organism has been named Macrorhabdus ornithogaster
1167
(Tomaszewski et al., 2003) and is also referred to as avian
gastric yeast. Infections have been documented in a wide
range of avian species including budgerigars, canaries,
finches, parrots, quail, cockatiels and ostriches. Large
numbers of organisms are present in clinically affected
birds whereas relatively few are found in asymptomatic
birds. Factors that predispose to disease include poor
hygiene, overcrowding and
1ageneticpredisposition
(Phalen, 2005). Clinical signs may include weight loss.
diarrhoea and vomiting. The pH in the proventriculus
changes from pH 2 to pH 7 or 8 (Simpson, 1992). Clinical
signs and demonstration of large numbers of the organism
in faeces or proventricular scrapings stained with Gram's
stain or Romanowsky stains are suggestive of proliferation
of this yeast. Definitive diagnosis is based on postmortem
examination and histopathology. The organism grows on
blood agar in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 and small
haemolytic colonies are detectable after incubation for 2
days.

produces yeast cells (blastoconidia), pseudohyphae, true
hyphae and arthrospores (Fig. 45.6). After inoculation of
Sabouraud dextrose agar, colonies appear in about 1 week.
This yeast, which is non-fermentative and urease-positive,
causes white piedra, a fungal infection of the hair shaft in
humans. Rare infections in animals include skin lesions in
horses and monkeys, and mastitis in cattle. Nasal

Chapter 46
Dimorphic fungi
Some fungi, referred to as dimorphic fungi, occur in two
distinct forms, a mould form and a yeast form. They exist
as moulds in the environment and when cultured on
Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25°C to 30°C. In animal tissues
and when cultured at 37°C on brain- heart infusion agar
with the addition of 5% blood, most grow as yeasts after
conversion from the more stable mould form. The
dimorphic fungi most often associated with disease in
domestic
 animals
are
Blastomyces
dermatitidis,
Histoplasma capsulatum and Coccidioides immitis (Table
46.1). The spores of these dimorphic fungi usually enter
hosts by the respiratory route and infection may be
disseminated throughout the body. A variant of H.
capsulatum, H. capsulatum var. farciminosum, hereafter
referred to as H. farciminosum, generally enters through
skin abrasions and produces lympho-cutaneous lesions,
epizootic lymphangitis, in horses and mules. Sporothrix
schencki, which can also infect dermal tissues following
trauma, produces occasional opportunistic infections.
Rare asymptomatic infections, caused by Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis (Costa et al., 1995) and Emmonsia species
(adiaspiromycosis), have been recorded  in domestic
animals. A clinical case of para- coccidioidomycosis has
been reported in a dog (Ricci et al., 2004), while
(Borman et al., 2009).
1176

Fig. 46.1. The teleomorph of B. dermatitidis is a member
of
the
phylum
Ascomycota
designated
1Ajellomyces
dermatitidis
Usual habitat
Although the precise natural habitat of B. dermatitidis is
unknown, it has been isolated from moist, acid soils rich in
organic matter (Archer et al., 1987).
Recognition and laboratory diagnosis
1179
· When incubated at 25°C to 30°C on Sabouraud dextrose
agar, mould colonies are white and cottony, usually
becoming brown with age. Oval or pear-shaped conidia (2 to
10 μm in diameter) are borne either on conidiophores or
directly on the hyphae.
· When incubated at 37°C on brain-heart infusion agar with
added cysteine and 5% blood, yeast colonies are cream to
tan, wrinkled and waxy. The yeast cells (8 to 10 |m in
diameter) are thick-walled and typically bud on a broad base.
·A soluble exoantigen of B. dermatitidis can be identified by
agar gel immunodiffusion using specific antiserum (Di
Salv0, 1998).
· Commercially available nucleic acid probes for use on
cultures of dimorphic fungi are sensitive and specific
(Stockman et af., 1993)
Yeast cells may be demonstrated in cytological and
histopathological  preparations  from  affected tissues  by
staining with the PAS stain or with methenamine silver.
Exudates or aspirates for cytological examination should be
stained with methylene blue or by the Giemsa method.
Alternatively, immunofluorescent staining can be used to
specifically identify the yeast form in tissues.
Polymerase chain reaction protocols are available for the
detection and identification of the fungus in clinical
specimens (Bialek et al., 2003)
· Serological procedures, suitable for demonstrating rising
antibody titres in affected dogs, are ELISA and counter-
immunoelectrophoresis.  Detection  of  fungal  antigen in
 o s ssi a q a p s
described (Spector et al., 2008).
Clinical infections
Blastomycosis most commonly affects dogs and humans
(Legendre et al., 198l). Infection in other species is
uncommon but it has been recorded in the cat (Breider et
1180
al., 1988). The disease is encountered in North America,
Africa, the Middle East and India.
Canine blastomycosis
Young male dogs of sporting breeds are particularly prone
to infection because of frequent exposure to the fungus in
the environment. Infection usually occurs by inhalation of
aerosolized spores or mycelial fragments. Conversion to
the yeast form occurs in the tissues. The yeast form is
much more resistant to neutrophils and mononuclear
phagocytes than the mould form. The best studied
virulence factor is BAD1 (Blastomyces adhesin; formerly
WI-l), a major surface protein that both promotes
attachment to cells in the respiratory tract and modulates
the host's immune response. Pulmonary blastomycosis, a
chronic debilitating condition, is the usual form of the
disease. Presenting
 signs include coughing, exercise
intolerance and dyspnoea. The extent of the infection,
which may be limited to the lungs and associated lymph
nodes, is largely determined by the immune competence of
the host. Although antibodies are produced, protective
immunity depends on the cellular immune response. Many
infections
are
subclinical.
detectableonly by
seroconversion. In animals with inadequate cell-mediated
immunity, there may be dissemination to skin, eyes and
bones. The central nervous system and, in male dogs, the
urogenital  tract
t  are occasionally  affected. Primary
cutaneous blastomycosis is uncommon (Wolf, 1979). The
clinical presentation in disseminated disease relates to the
distribution and severity of the lesions which are
granulomatous or  pyogranulomatous. Yeast cells are
numerous in these lesions.
1181
Itraconazole is the treatment of choice for dogs and cats
Amphotericin B may be combined with itraconazole if
infection is severe. Animals should be monitored for
possible nephrotoxic effects of treatment.
Histoplasmacapsulatum
Three variants of H.capsulatum
arerecognized:
Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum (H. capsulatum),
which can produce systemic histoplasmosis mainly in dogs
and
cats;  H.
capsulatum
var.
mnsouuounf
(H.
farciminosum)
which
 causes
equineepizootic
lymphangitis; and H. capsulatum var. duboisii, a human
pathogen limited to parts of equatorial Africa. The
teleomorphs of these variants are members of the phylum
Ascomycota, designated Ajellomyces capsulatus. The
mould and yeast forms of H. capsulatum are shown in Fig
46.2.
Usual habitat
Histoplasma capsulatum is found in soil, particularly when
enriched with bird or bat faeces. Aerosols, following

sunflower-like macroconidia (9 to 15 μm in diameter).
·When cultured at 37°C on brain-heart infusion agar with
added cysteine and 5% blood, yeast colonies are round,
mucoid and cream-coloured. Budding yeast cells are oval to
spherical (2 to 5 μm in diameter).
 A commercially available nucleic acid probe can be used for
identification of isolates (Stockman et al., 1993).
·Giemsa-stained smears of exudates or aspirates may be used
for demonstrating yeast forms in macrophages.
Histopathological examination of affected tissues reveals
pyogranulomatous foci containing yeast forms. Molecular
techniques can be used to detect the fungal DNA in
histological sections (Ueda et al., 2003).
1183
·A positive skin test, using histoplasmin, merely indicates
exposure to the fungus.
·Using histoplasmin as antigen in an agar gel
immunodiffusion test, two precipitin bands, H and M, can be
identified with serum from affected animals. The reliability
of this test for the diagnosis of the disease in animals is
questionable.
Clinical infections
Histoplasmosis, which occurs in many countries, is
endemic in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys and in
other areas of the USA. The dog and cat are the domestic
species most
toften affectedclinically.Epizootic
lymphangitis occurs in Eguidae in Africa, the Middle East
and Asia.
Canine and feline histoplasmosis
Most infections in these
 species  are asymptomatic
Following
inhalation,  microconidia are  ingested
1by
pulmonary alveolar macrophages, in which the yeast forms
persist and replicate. Granulomatous lesions may be found
in the lungs of both dogs and cats. Disseminated disease
has been recorded in both species, probably associated
with impaired cellmediated immunity. In dogs, ulcerative
intestinal lesions  are commonly
/encounteredwhereas
intestinal involvement is rare in cats. Clinical signs in
affected dogs include chronic cough, persistent diarrhoea
and emaciation. Less frequently, peripheral lymphadenitis,
ulcerative skin nodules, eye lesions, lameness and
neurological dysfunction may be encountered. The clinical
signs in cats relate mainly to pulmonary involvement and
include dyspnoea, depression, fever and loss of weight.
1184
Disseminated   histoplasmosis   is    invariably    fatal.
Itraconazole is the drug of choice on account of its low
toxicity. Ketoconazole and amphotericin B can be used for
treatment but animals should be monitored for signs of
toxicity.
Epizootic lymphangitis
Epizootic lymphangitis, caused by H. farciminosum, is a
contagious disease of Equidae which may have a high
prevalence when animals are in close contact. Infection is
usually acquired from environmental sources through
minor skin abrasions on the limbs. However, primary
ocular involvement and pulmonary involvement have also
been recorded. Characteristic lymphocutaneous lesions,
which resemble those of equine farcy (see Chapter 25),
consist of ulcerated discharging nodules usually located
along the course of thickened, hard, lymphatic vessels.
Regional lymphadenopathy is often present. Yeast cells of
H. farciminosum are found in large numbers in lesions,
mainly within macrophages (Chandler et al., 1980).
Histoplasma farciminosum, present in discharges, can be
spreadby biting
g insects and through contaminated
 grooming gear and harness.
In most countries where the disease is exotic, it is
notifiable and a test and slaughter policy is implemented.
If treatment is considered advisable, surgical

Coccidioides species
The geophilic fungus C. immitis can infect a wide range of
animal species including humans. Approximately 10o,000
human cases occur in the USA annually and the fungus has
been added to the select agent list of potential bioterrorism
pathogens in the USA. Although grouped with the
dimorphic fungi, C. immitis is biphasic rather than
dimorphic because typical yeast forms are not produced.
Large spherules containing endospores develop in tissues.
The spherule and mould forms of this fungus are shown in
Fig. 46.3. Respiratory infections may follow inhalation of
arthroconidia (arthrospores) produced from the mould
form of the fungus in soil. Following inhalation, the
arthrospore is stimulated by the presence of phagocytes,
increasedCO2and37°Cto differentiateintoa
multinucleated spherule which then reproduces by
endosporulation. Upon maturation, the spherule ruptures
releasing hundreds of endospores that can mature into new
spherules in the surrounding tissues. The large size of the
1186
spherule may allow it to avoid engulfment by phagocytes.
The tissue damage caused is thought to be the result of a
combination of enzymatic activity and the host's
immunological response. Systemic spread from pulmonary
lesions has been described. Coccidioides species are
members of the phylum Ascomycota but a teleomorphic
stage has not been demonstrated.
Usual habitat
Coccidioides immitis grows in the soil of arid or semiarid
low-lying areas of southwestern USA, northerm Mexico
and parts of Central and South America. Dust in these
areas may be heavily contaminated with arthroconidia.
Isolates from outside the endemic
region of the San Joaquin Valley in California and
formerly referred to as ‘non-California’ C. immitis have
been found to be sufficiently different to warrant separate
species status. The name C. posadasii has been proposed
(Fisher et al., 2002).
Recognition and laboratory diagnosis
Because culturing of Coccidioides species is hazardous, it
should be attempted only when stringent precautions are
observed, including the use of a biohazard cabinet.
Diagnosis  is  usually   based  on  clinical  findings  and
histopathology
·When cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25°C to 30°C,
colonies are shiny, moist and grey, becoming white and
cottony.  Thick-walled,  barrel-shaped  arthroconidia,
separated by empty cells which undergo degeneration, are
released following hyphal fragmentation (Fig. 46.3).
1187
· The identity of suspect cultures can be confirmed using
aqueous extracts in immunodiffusion tests with specific C.
immitis antiserum.
·A commercially available nucleic acid probe can be used on
cultures  for identification
1(Stockman et af.， 1993).
Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii can be distinguished
by  amplifying  and  sequencing  the  ribosomal  internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) region (Tintelnot et af., 2007).
·The history may indicate that a suspect animal came from an
endemic area. Radiographs of the thorax or affected limbs
may detect lesions consistent with coccidioidomycosis.
·Spherules of Coccidioides species may be demonstrated in
exudates or aspirates cleared with 10% KOH and may also
be identified in stained tissue sections.
Complement fixation, agar gel immunodiffusion, ELISA and
latex agglutination tests can be employed to demonstrate
rising antibody titres. The AGID test is highly specific but
not sensitive.
·A positive skin test, using a filtrate of a mycelial culture
(coccidioidin), is indicative of exposure to the fungus.
)ntraperitoneal inoculation of mice with material  from
cultures may be necessary to demonstrate the formation of
spherules in vivo.
Clinical infections
Since the occurrence of Coccidioides species is limited to
defined arid regions of south-western USA, Mexico and
Central
 and
South
America,
most
cases
coccidioidomycosis are encountered in animals from these
areas. Although many animals from these regions become
infected, relatively few develop clinical disease. The
domestic species most often affected is the dog. The
disease in dogs varies from asymptomatic to disseminated
and  fatal.  Clinical  coccidioidomycosis  has  also  been
described in horses, cats, llamas and marine mammals
1188
Canine coccidioidomycosis
In one prospective study, 7o% of seropositive dogs had no
evidence of clinical disease (Shubitz et al., 2005). Dogs
with mild pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, which present
with non-specific signs including cough, fever and
inappetence, may recover spontaneously. Animals with
weakness, depression, fluctuating fever and loss of weight.
Dissemination  from pulmonary
lesions, which
is
frequently related to immunosuppression, often results in
osteomyelitis with lameness and radiological evidence of
bone destruction as the condition progresses. Other tissues,
including the skin, may be affected. Therapy with azole
drugs, continued for at least 6 months, may be effective
but relapses can occur.
Equine coccidioidomycosis
Clinical  signs  of  coccidioidomycosis  in   horses  are
nonspecific and include intermittent fever, abdominal pain,
loss of   weight and evidence of pulmonary and
musculoskeletal involvement. Pulmonary disease, in which
coughing may be the only presenting sign, occurs in about
60% of cases. Musculoskeletal pain, usually associated
with osteomyelitis, is evident in about one-third of infected
animals.  Recurring  superficial  abscessation  is also a
feature. Thickening of the placenta, plaque-like lesions on
the umbilical cord and nodules in the lungs of the foetus
were recorded in a case of abortion caused by C. immitis
(Langham et al., 1977). Treatment of disseminated
coccidioidomycosis is usually unsuccessful.
1189
Sporothrix schenckii
Sporothrix species belong to the phylum Ascomycota.
Sporothrix schenckii is the pathogenic species and is
widely distributed in the environment where it grows as a
(ap un r 7 in l) aqday spues luionpod pino
and conidiophores. The yeast and mould forms of this
fungus are shown in Fig. 46.4. Infection occurs
sporadically in horses, cats, dogs and humans. Sporothrix
schenckii occurs worldwide and is particularly important in
subtropical and tropical regions. Molecular studies suggest
that S. schenckii is not a

Recognition and laboratory diagnosis
·When cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25°C, mould
colonies grow rapidly and are white, becoming black or
brown, wrinkled and leathery. Pear- shaped conidia are
borne in a rosette pattern on slender conidiophores. In older
cultures, conidia form singly on hyphae.
·When cultured at 35°C to 37°C on brain-heart infusion agar
containing 5% blood, cream to tan yeast colonies develop
within 3 weeks. The yeast cells, (2 to 3 × 3 to 5 μm), are
cigar-shaped.
· Direct microscopic examination of exudates from feline
lesions stained with methylene blue usually reveals large
numbers of yeast cells. They are sparse in exudates from
Other animals.
· Histopathological examination of tissue sections, stained by
the PAS or methenamine silver techniques, may reveal yeast
cells.
·Fluorescent antibody or immunoperoxidase techniques
applied to tissue sections allow specific identification of the
yeast cells.
Clinical infections
Sporotrichosis is a chronic cutaneous or lymphocutaneous
disease which rarely becomes generalized. Dissemination
usually
1  occurs in
1 immunocompromized  individuals.
Sporadic cases are recorded in horses, cats, dogs, cattle.
goats, pigs and humans. Infection is usually acquired from
the environment as a result of the inoculation of spores
beneath the skin or into wounds, where they develop as the
yeast form. Infected cats carry the organism in the nasal
       s
have been reported in cats in Brazil (Schubach et al.,
2008).
1191
Equine sporotrichosis
Lymphocutaneous  sporotrichosis  is  the most  common
form of the disease in horses (Blackford, 1984). Fungal
spores usually enter through skin abrasions on the lower
limbs. Nodules, which ulcerate and discharge a yellowish
exudate, develop along the course of superficial lymphatic
vessels. Subcutaneous oedema in the affected limb may
result
tfrom lymphatic obstruction.  Treatment with
inorganic iodides, administered in the feed, should
continue for approximately 30 days after clinical recovery.
Animals undergoing treatment should be monitored for
signs
of iodism.Itraconazole,fluconazole
and
voriconazole are effective for the lymphocutaneous form
of sporotrichosis. Surgical excision of early lesions may be
feasible.
Feline sporotrichosis
Nodular skin lesions occur most often on limb extremities,
head and tail. Secondary nodules can develop along the
course of lymphatics. Infection may be spread to other skin
sites by grooming. Nodules ulcerate and discharge a
seropurulent exudate. Following ulceration, extensive
areas of underlying muscle and bone may be exposed
(Dunstan et al., 1986). Large numbers of yeast cells in
discharges from lesions in cats may pose a health hazard to
humans handling affected animals (Zamri-Saad et al.,
1990). Itraconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole are
effective treatments for sporotrichosis
Canine sporotrichosis
1192
Sporotrichosis in dogs often manifests as multiple
ulcerated and crusted, alopecic, cutaneous lesions over the
head    and    trunk.  Lymphocutaneous   involvement
occasionally occurs but disseminated disease is rare (Scott
et al., 1974). The treatment regime is similar to that for
cats.

Zy gomycetes of veterinary importance
Fungi in the phylum Zygomycota characteristically have
broad (6 to 15 μm), coenocytic (relatively aseptate) hyphae
and replicate asexually by producing sporangiospores
within a sporangium. Fusion of gametangia from two
different strains, resulting in the
productionofa
thick-walled
 zygospore,
，isthe
modeofsexual
reproduction. Zygospores are seldom formed in cultures
except in the case of Basidiobolus species. The absence of
septa allows nutrients to pass along hyphae, resulting in
rapid growth. Septa may occasionally be observed at sites
of hyphal damage and close to sporangia. The coenocytic
hyphae are easily damaged and may become non-viable
during sampling
The phylum has two classes, the Zygomycetes and the
Trichomycetes. Three orders in the class Zygomycetes,
namely Mucorales,Mortierellales and Entomophthorales,
are of veterinary importance. The pathogenic species
Mortierella wolfii was formerly classified within  the
Mucorales, but has recently been placed in the newly
created order Mortierellales which has a single family
Mortierellaceae. Genera in the three orders containing
potentially pathogenic species are indicated in Fig. 47.1.
Absidiacorymbiferahas beenrenamedLichtheimia

saprophytes, which can cause sporadic opportunistic
infections. The term zygomycosis is applied to disease
caused by infection with a member of the Zygomycota.
1199
Clinical disease has been described in a wide range of
species including mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and
amphibians. The term phycomycosis was formerly used to
insidiosum,a
 fungal-like
eorganism which produces
opportunistic infections similar to those produced by
clinical disease tends to occur following infection with
members of the Mucorales and Mortierellales than with
members of the Entomophthorales which are associated
with  chronic diseases  of the nasal mucosa and
subcutaneous tissues.

Mucorales and Mortierellales
These fungi are commonly known as ‘pin’ or “bread'
moulds because their dark sporangia resemble pinheads
and they are often found growing on stale bread. The
morphological features of some members of the Mucorales
1202
are illustrated in Fig. 47.2. Several genera produce
root-like rhizoids which allow anchorage to surfaces.
Colonies grow rapidly on culture plates.
Strains associated with animal disease, which grow well at
37°C on Sabouraud dextrose agar, are susceptible to
cycloheximide. Sporulation of two species, Mortierella
wolfi and Saksenaea vasiformis, occurs only on media
deficient in certain nutrients.
Mucormycoses, diseases caused by fungi belonging to the
orders Mucorales and Mortierellales, are encountered
sporadically worldwide.  They
ofteninvolve the
gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract and associated
lymph nodes. Clinical disease may be severe with
dissemination to other organs on account of the
angiotropism of these agents. Infection may be associated
with immunosuppression.
Usual habitat
Membersof theMucoralesandMortierellalesare
saprophytes present in soil and vegetation and their spores
are often airborne. Although M. wolfi has been isolated
from soil near silage and rotting hay, it is otherwise
difficult to recover from environmental sources.

Factors that may

 include
immunodeficiency,
corticosteroid
therapy, prolonged
administrationof
broad-spectrum  antibiotics and  viral diseases such as
panleukopenia and infectious peritonitis in cats (Ossent,
1987). Pathogenic species are thermotolerant, permitting
them to grow at core body temperature. Infection may
follow ingestion or inhalation of spores from contaminated
environmental sources. Hyphae invade the mucosa,
submucosa and local vessel walls, producing an acute
necrotizing  thrombotic  vasculitis. Chronic  lesions are
usually localized and granulomatous.
Diagnostic procedures
1205
Apart from M. wolfii, which may produce abortion followed
by acute pneumonia, members of the Mucorales rarely cause
recognizable disease syndromes in animals.
·Specimens for laboratory examination should include tissues
for both histopathology and culture. Cotyledons, abomasal

·Staining of tissue sections by the PAS or methenamine silver
techniques facilitates detection of aseptate hyphae
·Fluorescent antibody methods have been used for identifying
pathogens such as Lichtheimia (Absidia) corymbifera
(Jensen et al., 1990).
· Isolation is carried out on Sabouraud dextrose agar without
cycloheximide. Cultures are incubated aerobically at 37°C
for up to 5 days.

Clinical infections
The zygomycoses of domestic animals are presented in
Table 47.1. Laboratory procedures including isolation of
the fungus and demonstration of hyphae in affected tissues
are essential for the diagnosis of zygomycosis. The clinical
signs, relating to the condition that predisposed to fungal
invasion, may mask signs arising from the fungal
infection. Irrespective of the location, mycotic lesions
1206
caused by members of the Mucorales and Mortierellales
are less commonly encountered than those caused by
Aspergillus species. Due to the sporadic nature of these
conditions, prevention  is difficult.
. Where possible,
exposure to spores should be minimized by ensuring
adequate ventilation and by exclusion of mouldy feedstuffs
from the diet. Factors that predispose to infection should
be avoided.

Mycotic abortion
The prevalence of mycotic abortion in cattle is influenced
bv climatic and other environmental factors. Reports from
some regions suggest that fungi may be involved in 7% of
bovine abortions (Knudtson
and Kirkbride, 1992).
Although Aspergillus species account for the majority of
cases in many countries, M. wolfii, Lichtheimia species,
Mucor species, Rhizomucor species and Rhizopus species
have also been implicated and in some regions may
predominate. Abortion, which usually occurs late in
gestation, is often linked to the feeding of mouldy hay or
silage. The location of lesions on cotyledons suggests
haematogenous infection of the uterus, possibly from a
pulmonary or enteric source. The cotyledons are enlarged
and necrotic, and the intercotyledonary placental tissue is
thickened and leathery. Vasculitis, associated with hyphal
invasion, is demonstrable in sections of affected
cotyledons. Occasionally, lesions may be observed grossly
on the skin of aborted foetuses.
Abortion due to M. wolfi, an important cause of mycotic
abortion in New Zealand, may be followed within days by
an acute fibrinonecrotic fungal pneumonia (Carter et al.,
1973). Because of the difficulty in isolating M. wolfii from
autolysed tissues, abortion caused by this organism may be
underdiagnosed (MacDonald and Corbel, 1981). Mycotic
1208
abortion in mares caused by Lichtheimia corymbifera has
been reported.
Alimentary tract infections
Mycotic rumenitis in cattle may follow mucosal damage
associated with ruminal lactic acidosis. The microscopic
appearance of the causal fungi in ruminal lesions suggests
that, in most cases, zygomycetes of the genera
Lichtheimia, Absidia and Mucor are involved (Brown et
al., 2007). Infarctions due to thrombosis, necrosis and
haemorrhage are major features of the mycotic lesions.
Extension of the inflammatory process
through the ruminal wall results in fibrinous peritonitis.
Zygomycotic abomasitis and ulceration in calves, which
may follow neonatal infection, can also produce
perforation    and
1  peritonitis.  Acute    gastrointestinal
zygomycosis has been recorded in piglets (Reed et al.,
1987).
Mycotic pneumonia
An acute fatal pneumonia of cows, which is caused by M.
wolfii and occasionally follows abortion due to the fungus,
is a well recognized syndrome in New Zealand (Carter et
al., 1973). Chronic pneumonic lesions caused by other
zygomycetes are encountered sporadically in cattle and
other domestic species.
Entomophthorales
Basidiobolus  and
1 Conidiobolus, two genera in the
Entomophthorales, are sometimes associated with
1209
opportunistic infections in animals. A unique feature of
these fungi is the production of a single conidium which is
forcibly discharged when mature. Molecular data tend to
suggest that Basidiobolus species are more closely related
to chytrid fungi than to Entomophthorales. Basidiobolus
ranarum is the only pathogenic species in the genus and is
limited in distribution to the warmer regions of the world.
Conidiobolus species associated with disease include C.
coronata, C. incongruous and C. lamprauges. The
distribution of these species is also associated with warmer
regions of the world.
Usual habitat
Basidiobolus species are saprophytes in soil and decaying
fruit and vegetable material, and may be present in the
faeces of amphibians, reptiles, insectivorous bats and
marsupials (Speare and Thomas, 1985).
Conidiobolus species are saprophytes in soil and in
decaying vegetation, particularly in rainforests.
Differentiation of the Entomophthorales
·Colonial morphology:
Basidiobolus  species are  moderately  fast-growing  and
form flat, smooth, yellowish grey colonies which become
radially folded with a white powdery surface. They have
an earthy odour similar to that of Streptomyces species
smooth, cream-coloured colonies which become radially
1210
folded and brownishwith a white powdery surface.
Discharged conidia adhere to the Petri dish lid.
·  Microscopic appearance:
      s 
zygospores (20 to 50 μm in diameter) form.
Conidiobolus species produce simple conidiophores which
bear solitary, spherical conidia (10 to 25 μm in diameter).
Germination of conidia results in the production of single
or multiple hyphal tubes with secondary conidia.
· Differentiation to a species level is carried out in
mycological reference laboratories.
Pathogenesis and pathology
Although not clearly defined, the route of entry of these
fungi is probably through minor abrasions in the skin or
nasal mucous membranes. Hyphal invasion of blood
vessels is uncommon. Spread by lymphatics sometimes
occurs (Hillier et al., 1994). Although disseminated
disease is rare, it has been reported (Miller and Turnwald,
1984) in a dog infected with B. ranarum (syn. B.
haptosporus).
Granulomatous lesions result from infection with these
opportunistic pathogens. An eosinophilic deposit around
individual hyphae (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon) may
represent immune
complexformation
(Millerand
Campbell, 1984).
1211
Diagnostic procedures
·Specimens for laboratory examination should include biopsy
Or post-mortem tissues for histopathology and culture. Care
should be taken to avoid excessive tissue disruption during
sampling as the coenocytic hyphae are easily damaged and
become non-viable.
thin-walled hyphae of Basidiobolus species are usually up to
20 μm in diameter whereas those of Conidiobolus species
are up to 12 μm in diameter. There may be evidence of an
eosinophilic cuff or sheath around individual hyphae
(SplendoreHoeppli phenomenon).
These fungi are thermotolerant and can be isolated on
Sabouraud dextrose agar without added cyclohexamide after
incubation aerobically at 37°C for up to 5 days.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
Colonial morphology
Microscopic appearance.
· For identification to a specific level, specimens should be
sent to a reference laboratory.
Clinical infections
The  entomophthomycoses  of domestic  animals  are
indicated in Table 47.1. Basidiobolus species cause
cutaneous lesions in the horse and dog which resemble
those associated with Pythium insidiosum (see Chapter
48).Infections  with  Conidiobolus  species  cause
granulomas in horses (Humber et al., 1989; Zamos et al.
1996), sheep (Carrigan et al., 1992; Silva et al., 2007) and
1lamas (French and Ashworth, 1994). On rare occasions,
1212
Conidiobolus  species  cause   pyogranulomatous  and
cutaneous lesions in dogs (Hillier et al., 1994).

Fungus-like organisms of veterinary importance
Three  eukaryotic,  fungus-like  organisms,  Pythium
insidiosum,Rhinosporidium seeberi and Lacazia loboi,
cause rare sporadic infections in animals which have
contact with contaminated water. These organisms, which
are found in either mycelial or unicellular forms in tissues,
induce host reactions similar to those encountered in
fungal infections. Pythiosis and rhinosporidiosis have been
described in domestic animal species and in humans.
Lacazia loboi is mainly a human pathogen although
sporadic cases have been recorded in dolphins.
Pythiuminsidiosum
This fungus-like organism, also known as Hyphomyces
destruens, is classified in the class Oomycetes, kingdom
Chromista (kingdom Protista) It is found in aquatic
environments and is an opportunistic animal pathogen
whereas many other Pythium species are important as plant
pathogens. Infection with P. insidiosum is rare in animals.
        
organism and the production of motile zoospores (Fig
48.1).
Pythium insidiosum grows on a variety of laboratory media
when incubated at both 25°C and 37°C. However,
zoospores are produced only in water cultures. On solid
media and in plant and animal tissues, the organism
1217
develops aseptate hyphae (4 to 10 μm in diameter) which
are similar morphologically to those of the zygomycetes.

produced by the zoospores at body temperature, extend
into the tissues and may invade blood vessels, facilitating
a  cellular 
rimmune response consisting mostly of
eosinophils. Much of the tissue damage arising from the
infection  is thought to result from degranulation of
eosinophils and mast cells.
Diagnostic procedures
 The nature and distribution of lesions and a history of access
 no i  s    
suggest the disease.
· Specimens, including biopsy material and samples from
cutaneous lesions in horses, should be delivered immediately
to the laboratory. Samples for transportation should be
washed in sterile distilled water and transported at ambient
temperature.
· Tissue sections, stained by the PAS or methenamine silver
methods, are used to demonstrate hyphal forms.
· Immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase techniques can
be used to identify P. insidiosum in tissue sections.
· Detection and identification of Pythium insidiosumhas been
achieved using a nested PCR assay (Grooters and Gee,
2002).
· Sabouraud dextrose agar, inoculated with material from
lesions, is incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 to 48 hours.
The colonies, which are flat, whitish and radiating, may be
up to 20 mm in diameter after 24 hours.
· Identification criteria for isolates:
_ Colonial morphology
Aseptate hyphae.
1221
·Specific identification should be carried out in a reference
laboratory. A DNA probe has been developed (Schurko et
al., 2004)
·Serological tests such as agar gel diffusion and ELISA have
been used for the diagnosis of pythiosis in affected animals
(Grooters et al., 2002).
Clinical infections
Pythiosis is a rare, sporadic, non-contagious condition
which occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. It
has been recorded in Australia, New Zealand, New
Guinea, the Caribbean islands, and South, Central and
North America. Although horses and dogs are the species
most commonly infected, a few cases have been reported
in calves (Miller et al., 1985).
Pythiosis in horses
Cutaneous pythiosis is the usual presentation in horses
(Chaffin et al., 1992 ), although intestinal pythiosis has
also been reported (Morton et al., 1991). Lesions usually
occur on those parts of the body, particularly the limbs,
which come in contact with water containing zoospores.
Lesions are large, circular, granulomatous nodules which
often ulcerate. Sinus tracts may develop exuding a
sero-sanguineous discharge. Pruritus is marked. Necrotic
yellowish coral-like masses (kunkers’ or ^leeches') can be
removed intact from the granulomas. In addition to
necrotic tissue, these masses contain eosinophils and
hyphae of P. insidiosum (Mendoza et al., 1993). Bone
involvement can occur  in chronic disease. Surgical
excision of lesions followed by immunotherapy has proved
successful in some cases (Miller, 198l; Mendoza et al.,
1222
2003). Enteric pythiosis is characterized by stenotic
fibrous gastrointestinal lesions.
Pythiosis in dogs
Canine infection most commonly involves the stomach and
small intestine (Miller, 1985 ). Subcutaneous pythi-osis is
less commonly encountered (Foil et al., 1984). Intestinal
lesions are usually extensive when an affected animal is
first presented for examination. Clinical signs include
vomiting, weight loss, intermittent diarrhoea and palpable
abdominal masses. Extension of the infection to the
pancreas, mesenteric lymph nodes and bile ducts may
occur. Cutaneous lesions, which occur on limbs, face or
tail, are granu-lomatous nodules often with discharging
sinus tracts. Surgical excision of lesions and long-term
treatment with itraconazole may be beneficial.
Rhinosporidium seeberi
Rhinosporidium seeberi is a fungus-like organism which
   e n  a n  s
maintained in monolayers of human rectal tumour cells
(Levy et al., 1986 ). It belongs to a group of aquatic
protistan parasites in the class Mesomycetozoea, kingdom
Protozoa  (kingdom  Protista).
.Rhinosporid-iosis，
a
sporadic, non-contagious, pyogranulomatous infection of
the skin or mucosa, has been recorded in horses, dogs,
cattle, goats, waterfowl and humans. Cases occur
predominantly   in   tropical   and  subtropical
1regions,
particularly in Sri Lanka, southern India and Argentina.
Usual habitat
1223
It is generally considered that stagnant water and possibly
soil are the natural habitats of the organism.
Pathogenicity and pathology
Rhinosporidium seeberi is of low pathogenic potential and
disseminated infection is rare. The life cycle of the
commonly as a chronic polypous rhinitis characterized by
the presence of large sporangia (loo to 400 μm in
diameter) in affected tissues. The sporangia, which have
double-contoured cell walls with an outer chitinous layer
and an inner layer of cellulose, contain up to 16,000
endospores (approximately  7 μm in diameter).  Mature
endospores can be stained by the PAS and methenamine
silver methods. Several electron-dense bodies (1.5 to
2.0μm in diameter) containing DNA are present in the
endospores.
The polyps, which may be sessile or pedunculated and up
to 3cm in diameter, are composed of soft fibromyxomatous
stromal tissue covered by epithelium. Mature sporangia
may be detectable grossly in the stroma as minute white
they rupture. The release of endospores elicits a marked
pyogranulomatous reaction (Easley et al., 1986)
Diagnostic procedures
· Nasal polyposis may suggest the presence of the condition.
·Specimens for laboratory examination should include biopsy
material and scrapings from lesions.
1224
· Cytological   examination   demonstrates  a   neutrophilic
response and many endospores. Neutrophils form aggregates
around endospores.

Clinical infections
Rhinosporidiosis, which is endemic in subtropical and
tropical regions, has been encountered also in North
America and Europe (Caniatti et al., 1998; Leeming et al..
2007 ; Miller and Baylis, 2009 ). Infection occurs through
minor trauma in skin or mucous membranes. The reddish
brown polyps in rhinosporidiosis may project from the
nares and can occlude the nasal passages. Noisy breathing
may be exacerbated by exercise. Nasal discharge is usually
present  and  epistaxis
may occur. The uncommon
cutaneous lesions may be single or multiple and sessile or
pedunculated.
Treatment
by
cryosurgery
or
electrocauterization is
 suggested
to
avoidexcessive
bleeding. Diamino-diphenylsulphone (dapsone) has proved
beneficial although deleterious side effects, including
haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia, may occur in
dogs. Recurrence of rhinosporidiosis may occur following
treatment.
Lacazia loboi
Lacazia loboi, also known as Loboa loboi, is an
unclassified yeast-like organism not yet cultured in
vitro(Taborda et al., 1999 ). Phylogenetic studies have
indicated that it is closely related to Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis, a dimorphic fungal pathogen of humans, in
the order Onygenales, phylum Ascomycota (Herr et al.,
1225
2001 ). It is probably an aquatic saprophyte and is capable
of causing granulomatous cutaneous disease (lobomycosis
or keloidal blastomycosis) in humans and dolphins. In skin
sections stained by the PAS or methenamine silver
techniques, large numbers of yeast - like cells (5 to 12 μm
in diameter) are present in multinucleate giant cells. They
replicate by budding and some remain attached to each
other by narrow bridge-like structures forming short chains
(Fig. 48.2).
Lobomycosis has not been reported in domestic animals.
Human cases of the disease have been reported from
tropical regions of South and Central America and affected
dolphins have been found off the coast of Florida (Reif et
al., 2006 ). Skin changes in dolphins range from white
crusts to nodular or verrucose lesions which ulcerate easily
and bleed (Bossart, 1984 ). Small lesions can be removed
surgically. Lobomycosis in a dolphin has been treated
successfully with miconazole.

smears from lesions. These yeast-like cells often occur in
short chains connected by short bridge-like structures.

Pneumocystis carinii
Pneumocystis carinii is a unicellular organism with a life
cycle resembling that of a protozoal parasite. On the basis
of significant genetic evidence it is classified in the family
Pneumocystidaceae, phylum Ascomycota, in the kingdom
Fungi (Pixley et al., 1991). Although the life cycle of P.
carinii has not yet been fully determined, intrapulmonary
infection probably involves asexual and sexual phases. The
life cycle involves a thin-walled haploid trophic or
vegetative form which can undergo binary fission or can
enter into sexual reproduction through conjugation. Mating
results in production of a diploid zygote and the initiation
of sporogenesis. This is followed by transitional changes
involving three consecutive sporocytic stages into a
thick-walled cyst containing eight spores. Following their
release, these ascospores enter a vegetative stage,
completing the life cycle. A cell wall is present only in the
cyst form of the organism. Because the main sterol in this
thin cell wall is cholesterol rather than ergos-terol, this
form of the organism is refractory to standard antifungal
drugs. Recent studies suggest that benign colonization by
mammals is relatively common, resulting in carriage and
airborne transmission to susceptible in-contact animals of
the samespecies(Chabéetal.，  2004).In
immunocompromized individuals, infection may result in
with immunosuppression following HIV infection. The
organism has been found in a wide range of domestic, wild
1231
and captive mammalian species. Formerly, the genus was
described as having a single species. Current molecular
studies suggest
thatP.carinii
iis made up of  a
heterogeneous group of genetically isolated strains that
have undergone functional and genetic adaptation to their
respective host species over millions of years. Strains of P.
carinii from different animal species exhibit a narrow host
range and have distinct genetic and antigenic profiles
(Peters et a/., 1994 ). A trinomial nomenclature has been
proposed whereby the name of a particular strain or
'special form’ (forma specialis ) is derived from the host
species from which it originated. As an example, the name
P. carinii fsp. equi would apply to horse strains. In recent
years additional species have been formally described and
proposed: P. carinii and P. wakefieldiae isolated from rats,
P. jirovecii from humans, P. murina from laboratory mice
and P. oryctolagi from Old World rabbits. The organism is
difficult to culture in vitro.
Key points
·Member of the kingdom Fungi
· Distinct strains appear to be associated with
particular animal species
Difficult to cul ture in vitro
· Trophic, cyst and spore forms may be found in
lungs of affected animals
Pneumomia,
which
occurs
only
immunosuppressed animals, occasionally affects
horses and dogs
Usual habitat
1232
The natural reservoir of P. carinii is not known but
serological and molecular  studies suggest  a high
prevalence of colonization in young, clinically normal
mammals, probably as a result of airborme or transplacental
transmission.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
The exact mode of transmission is uncertain but airborne
spread is considered to be the most important route. In the
animal body, the trophic form adheres in clusters to type 1
alveolar cells. Characteristic pathological findings, which
are similar in all species, include diffuse pulmonary
consolidation, marked thickening of alveolar septa and
proteinaceous exudate in alveoli
Diagnostic procedures
·Specimens for laboratory examination may include lung
tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Cytological and histopathological specimens are used for
diagnosis. Giemsa-stained preparations can be used to
demonstrate the different forms of the organism, whereas the
methenamine silver method stains only the cyst form.
Fluorescent-conjugated monoclonal antibody techniques are
sensitive and specific.
[mmunocytochemical  methods  can  be used  for  specific
identification in tissue sections.
 The organism may be detected during electron microscopic
examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
·The polymerase chain reaction is used in reference
laboratories for DNA amplification (Peters et al., 1994 ;
Ramos Vara et af., 1998).
·Serological tests, employed for epidemiological surveys, are
not of diagnostic value.
1233
Clinical nfections
Most cases of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystisspecies
in domestic animals have been recorded in dogs, horses,
rabbits, cats and pigs. The condition has been most
extensively studied in young rabbits which provides a
non-immunosuppressed model for Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia
(Soulezet
al.,  1989).Hereditary
immunodeficiency has been suggested as an explanation
for the frequency of the disease in miniature dachshunds
(Farrow et al., 1972). Arabian foals with combined
immunodeficiency disorder are particularly susceptible
(Perryman et al., 1978). Affected animals are afebrile and
present with respiratory distress. Without treatment the
disease
may
prove
fatal.
Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, administered orally for
2 weeks, is usually effective.

Opportunistic infections caused predominantly by phaeoid
fungi
A
variety
of saprophytic fungi which
can infect
traumatized
tissues
produce
slowly
progressive
inflammatory lesions. Clinical cases are uncommon and
generally
represent exploitation of
predisposing
conditions,  particularly
 devitalized 
tissues
 and
immuno-suppression. Although lesions mainly involve the
dermis or subcutis, they may be found elsewhere. In this
chapter, discussion is limited to the saprophytic fungi
which
have
been
aetiologically
implicated
1n
phaeohyphomycosis and
1eumycetomas. Eumycetomas
causedby
ySporothrixschenki,Pythiuminsidiosum,
Aspergillus species and the zygomycetes are described in
other chapters.
Phaeohyphomycosis is caused by  species of phaeoid
(dematiaceous,  pigmented)
fungi
which
produce
dark-walled hyphae, pseudohyphae and yeast cells in vivo.
Mycetomas are chronic subcutaneous infections caused by
fungi (eumycetomas) or actinomycetes (actinomycetomas)
and characterized by the presence of grains or granules
Eumycetomas may be caused by phaeoid or non-phaeoid
fungi. The granulomatous lesions in eumycetomas are
distinguished from the lesions of phaeohyphomycosis by
the presence of granules composed largely of fungal
mycelia
1n
exudates.
In
some
instances
phaeohyphomycosis, especially when caused by infection
withBipolaris specifera or withExserohilumrostratum,
1237
has been mistakenly categorized as eumycetoma (Chandler
et al., 1980). True eumycetomas are rare in domestic
animal species (Brodey et al., 1967; Lambrechts et al.,
1991).
The pigmentation of phaeoid fungi is due to the presence
of melanin in their hyphal walls. The dark coloration of
granules occasionally found in eumycetomas also derives
from melanin. Some phaeoid species such as Bipolaris
species and Scedoporium species produce meagre amounts
of melanin. In lesions caused by these species, their
hyphae
appear 
non-pigmented
intissue sections
Masson-Fontana silver stain can be used to demonstrate
the presence of melanin. Melanin is thought to play a role
in fungal penetration of tissues by acting as an antioxidant
aiding survival of the oxidative bursts produced by
phagocytes and by protecting the fungal cell wall through
the binding of host hydrolytic enzymes.
Key points
· Phaeoid (pigmented) fungi can infect traumatized
tissue causing phaeohyphomycosis
· An uncommon manifestation of infection with both
phaeoid and non-phaeoid  fungi is eumycetoma
formation
· The granulomatous lesions of phaeohyphomycosis
and  eumycetoma  occur  most   frequently
in
subcutaneous tissues
· Sinus formation with serosanguineous discharges is
a feature of superficial lesions
 Discharges
 from
eumycetomas
contain
macroscopic  granules  composed   of  fungal
1238
elements. Granules formed by phaeoid fungi are
black;  those formed  by  other fungi lack
pigmentation
Usual habitat
The  fungi  implicated   in  phaeohyphomycosis  and
eumycetoma are found in soil and in plant material. Some
are distributed worldwide and others are restricted to
tropical and subtropical regions.
Clinical infections
The more important fungal species that have been isolated
from  subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis in domestic
animals are presented in Table 50.1. Some of these fungal
species have also been isolated from the
rare eumycetomas which have been confirmed in domestic
animals. The domestic species most often affected by
phaeohyphomycosis are  cats, horses and
1cattle.
        g
dogs (Brodey et al., 1967). Curvularia and Bipolaris
species have been recovered from granulo-matous lesions
in the nasal cavity of cattle.Scedosporium apiospermum
(anamorph of Pseudallescheria boydii) has been isolated
from lesions of white line disease in horses.

of
nodular granulomatous fungal skin disease in cats in the
1240
United Kingdom (Miller, 2010 ). They have also been
associated with nodular skin disease in horses (Genovese
et al., 2001 ). The presence of distinct granules (either
black or pale) in discharges distinguishes the lesions of
eumycetomas from those of phaeohyphomycosis.
Systemic lesions caused by phaeoid fungi are extremely
rare.
Osteolytic

 by
Phialemoniumobovatum
(Lomax et al.，1986) and
Scedosporium inflatum (Salkin et al., 1992), now termed
S. prolificans, has been recorded in dogs. Cerebral
phaeohyphomycosis
caused  by Cladophialophora
bantiana has been reported in dogs and a cat (Dillehay et
al., 1987 ). A chronic granulomatous lesion in the
abdominal cavity of a dog was described as a black grain
eumycetoma (Lambrechts et al., 1991)
Diagnosis
· Suitable  specimens for  laboratory examination  include
fine-needle aspirates, punch biopsies and post-mortem tissue
samples.
· Specimens are inoculated on to Sabouraud dextrose agar,
with and without antimicrobial agents, and incubated
aerobically at 25°C to 30°C for up to 6 weeks. [solates
reference laboratory.
· Isolates are identified by colonial morphology and the
microscopic appearance of fruiting structures (Table 50.1).
However, a commercial DNA sequencing kit has shown
some promise in the identification of dematiaceous fungi
(Hall et af., 2004).
· Both PAS and methenamine silver techniques are used for
demonstrating hyphae in tissue sections.
1241
· The Masson - Fontana silver stain is used to demonstrate
melanin in the hyphae of phaeoid fungi.
·A deposit  of eosinophilic material around mycelial
aggregates  in eumycetomas,  referred to as  the
Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon, may be demonstrable in
tissue sections.
Treatment
·Discontinuation of any form of immunosuppressive therapy
(Swift et al.,2006).
· Surgical excision of lesions is effective (Beale and Pinson,
1990).
·Although antifungal therapy is usually ineffective, a
combination of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine may be
beneficial.

Mycotoxins and mycotoxicoses
Mycotoxins, secondary metabolites of certain fungal
species, are produced when toxigenic strains of these
organisms grow under defined conditions on crops, pasture
or stored feed. The acute or chronic intoxication following
ingestion  of  contaminated plant material is  termed
mycotoxicosis. More than 1o0 fungal species are known to
elaborate mycotoxins, and approximately 400 secondary
metabolites with toxigenic activity are produced by these
fungi. Many of these
fungi
ibelong to the genera
Penicillium,Aspergillus,Fusarium and Claviceps
Factors
affecting
mycotoxin
 production  and    the
development of mycotoxicosis are presented in Fig. 51.1.
For fungal  growth
1 and toxin production, a suitable
substrate must be available along with moisture and
optimal  temperature
and
oxygen
levels.  Some
mycotoxicoses
have a high
1 prevalence  in particular
geographical regions where agricultural practices  favour
their occurrence. Mycotoxicoses tend to be more common
in developing countries where methods of harvesting and
storage are inadequate and where regulations aimed at
preventing the distribution and sale of suspect crops for
human consumption or animal feed are not enforced.
Toxigenic strains of fungi may grow preferentially on
particular parts of a plant, some favouring the
carbohydrate-containing seeds or  kernels and others
utilizing the cellulose substrate in fibrous stems or leaves.
1245
Mycotoxins are non-antigenic, low molecular weight
compounds.  Many
are
heat-stable, retaining toxicity
following exposure to the processing temperatures used for
pelleting and other procedures (Box 51.1). A particular
mycotoxin may be produced by a number of fungal
species. Moreover,
, some fungi can elaborate several
mycotoxins  which may  differ  in  biological  activities.
producing complex clinical effects. Clinical diagnosis of
the mycotoxicoses may also be complicated by the
presence of a number of toxigenic species on a food
source. The severity of clinical signs is influenced by the
period of exposure to contaminated feed and the amount of
mycotoxin ingested. Some batches of feed may be
contaminated and mycotoxin may be unevenly distributed
in a batch. Clinical evidence of the targeting of particular
organs such as the liver or the central nervous system is a
feature of some mycotoxicoses.  Immunosuppression,
mutagenesis, neoplasia or teratogenesis may also result
from exposure. Epidemiological and clinical features of
mycotoxicoses are summarized in Box 51.2
Key points
·Certain fungi elaborate metabolites (mycotoxins)

environmental conditions

Box 51.1 Characteristics of mycotoxins.
·Low molecular weight, heat-stable substances
· Unlike many bacterial toxins, non-antigenic;
exposure does not induce a protective immune
response
·Many are active at low dietary levels
· Specific target organs or tissues affected
· Toxic effects include immunosuppression,
mutagenesis, teratogenesis and carcinogenesis
· Accumulation in tissues of food-producing
animals or excretion in milk may result in human
exposure
Mycotoxicoses of defined veterinary importance are
presented in Table 5l.1. The role of a number of
mycotoxins considered to be involved in diverse clinical
conditions in domestic animals is not yet clearly defined
(Lomax et al, 1984; Griffiths and Done, 1991). Many
diseases with suspected links to mycotoxins are being
re-evaluated as the toxic activities of new fungal
metabolites are investigated (Fink-Gremmels, 2008).
Aflatoxicosis
Fungi associated with the production of aflatoxins, the
mycotoxins which cause aflatoxicosis, include Aspergillus
flavus, A. parasiticus and A. nominus. Ingestion of
aflatoxins, which are difuranocoumarins elaborated by
toxigenic strains of Aspergillus species, produces disease
in a wide range of mammals, birds and aquatic species.
Many substrates support the growth of aflatoxin
production by toxigenic Aspergillus species. Maize, wheat,
oats, barley, rice, peanuts and other nuts are among the
1248
crops that may be naturally contaminated by these
mycotoxins. Fungal growth and mycotoxin production can
proceed when the moisture content of a harvested crop or
stored feed is close to 16% in a temperature range of 14°C
to 30?C. In surveys of pet foods for the presence of
aflatoxins, wild bird feed was found to be the most
contaminated (Leung et al., 2006). All animal species are
susceptible to aflatoxins but
t young animals and
monogastric animals are more susceptible than mature
ruminants.

 requires 
demonstration
of
significant levels of mycotoxin in feed or in
tissues from affected animals
Although four prominent aflatoxins, namely B1, B2, G1
and G2, are particularly important in disease production,
many more have been identified. Aflatoxin B1, which is
口
1249
the mycotoxin most often encountered in disease outbreaks
and is reported to be particularly toxic for humans and
animals, is hepatotoxic and carcinogenic. After absorption
from the gastrointestinal tract, aflatoxins are metabolized
by the liver to a range of toxic and nontoxic products. The
liver is the principal organ affected by aflatoxins, resulting
in hepatocellular necrosis and impaired liver function. In
cattle, aflatoxin B1, which escapes rumen degradation, is
converted into a hydroxylated form called aflatoxin M1,
which is excreted in milk (Fink-Gremmels, 2008)
Toxicityrelates
to binding
ofmetabolitesto
macro-molecules,
especially
nucleic
 acid
 and
nucleoproteins. Consequently, the toxic effects include
reduced protein synthesis, carcinogenesis, teratogenesis
and aplasia of the thymic cortex leading to depressed
cell-mediated immunity (Osweiler, 1990).
Clinical findings
Aflatoxicosis has been encountered worldwide in many
domestic species. There is considerable variation in
susceptibility between species and within age groups.
Ducklings, turkey poults, calves, pigs and dogs are
sensitive to toxic effects, whereas sheep and adult cattle
are more resistant. Aflatoxicosis is uncommon in horses
and goats. Subacute aflatoxicosis, associated 
with
prolonged exposure to low concentrations of toxin, usually
presents as slowly developing ill thrift and reduced growth
rate. Immunosuppression, with increasing prevalence of
endemic infection and inadequate responses to routine
vaccination, may also be detected in affected groups of
animals. This insidious form of aflatoxicosis is often of
1250
greater economic significance than acute forms of the
disease associated with high concentrations of toxin in the
diet. Acute aflatoxicosis has been recorded in birds and
cattle. Ataxia, opisthotonos and sudden death are features
of the acute disease in ducklings. Hepatopathy is a
common finding and, in birds more than 3 weeks old.
subcutaneous
haemorrhages
may
be evident.
Haemorrhagic diathesis, probably related to hepatopathy,
is a characteristic of acute toxicity in chickens and turkeys.
In turkey X disease, the first clearly defined outbreak of
acute aflatoxicosis, widespread haemorrhages may have
been due to the combined effect of aflatoxins and
cyclopiazonic
 acid,
which
are
 often
 produced
simultaneously by A.flavus (Robb,1993 ).Acute
aflatoxicosis in cattle may rapidly result in death
(Cockcroft, 1995). In affected calves, blindness, circling,
tenesmus, diarrhoea and convulsions have been recorded
Low levels of aflatoxins fed to young pigs depressed their
cell-mediated   and  humoral
immune
responsesand
increased their susceptibility to infectious agents. Clinical
signs of aflatoxicosis in dogs include depression, anorexia,
vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice and epistaxis. Aflatoxins
present in a diet which was fed for many months were
identified as the cause of epidemic liver cancer in rainbow
trout (Coppock and Jacobsen, 2009). Deaths in the human
population in India following consumption of maize
contaminated with aflatoxin have been reported (Moss,
2002 ).
Diagnosis
· Except in outbreaks of acute disease, clinical signs are
vague. Epidemiological features and postmortem findings
1251
may be of diagnostic value. Aflatoxin may be demonstrated
in tissues obtained at post-mortem.
Carefully selected samples of suspect feed should be stored
at-20°C until analysed.

include:
 Immunoaffinity columns which are sometimes used for
sample purification to improve sensitivity.
1254
Thin-layer   chromatography.  Chromatograms  are
examined under UV light for the four main toxins on the
basis of position and fluorescence. The fluorescence of
aflatoxins B1 and B2 is blue and with G1 and G2 it is
green.
- High-performance liquid chromatography
- Ultra-performance liquid chromatography combined
with mass spectrometry.
Immunoassay
techniques such as ELISA and
radioimmunoassay procedures.
- Biological assays such as bile duct proliferation in
ducklings, chick embryo bioassays, brine shrimp larvae
tests and trout embryo bioassays.
Control and prevention
· The growth of fungal contaminants on stored feed should be
pue Susaiey sumoloy sanseu aendondde Kq paul
during storage.
· Batches of food for human and animal consumption may be
monitored for aflatox in contamination.
    s    
pressure has been used to detoxify contaminated batches of
feed.
·Aflatoxins B1 and G1 are rapidly degraded by 2% ozone but
aflatoxins B2 and G2 are more resistant and require
treatment with 20% ozone for rapid degradation.
·Dilution of contaminated feed with uncontaminated supplies
is no longer recommended and is illegal in the EU as a
method to reduce aflatoxin concentration and minimize
toxicity.
1255
Addition of hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate to feed
is reported to reduce aflatoxin toxicity (Harvey et af., 1989).
· Glucomannan-containing polymers extracted from yeast cell
walls have a high adsorptive capacity for binding different
mycotoxins including aflatoxin B1 (Leung et af., 2006).
Citrinin toxicosis
Many Penicillium species including P. citrinum, P.
viridicatumand P.
.expansum produce the mycotoxin
citrinin. Aspergillus terreus and a number of other
Aspergillus species also produce the mycotoxin which is a
potent nephrotoxin. Citrinin and ochratoxin A,which are
often found together in stored cereal grain, can act
synergistically. The toxic effects of citrinin include severe
kidney damage, hepatic damage and immunosuppression
as a consequence of damage to the immune system. Wheat,
oats, maize, barley and rice are among the cereals which
may contain citrinin.
In Scandinavia, a condition in pigs referred to as a porcine
nephrosis syndrome has been attributed to consumption of
barley contaminated with citrinin. Clinical features of this
condition  include  increased  water  consumption  and
increased production of dilute urine containing protein. A
haemorrhagic syndrome in cattle is associated with citrinin
poisoning. In poultry, signs of citrinin intoxication include
lethargy，
decreased
　 feed
consumption, increased
consumption of water and reduction in weight gain.
Following
feeding trials, dogs developed emesis,
intussusception and renal failure. Natural citrinin toxicosis
in dogs seems unlikely in view of the strong emetic effect
of this mycotoxin.
1256
Cyclopiazonic acid toxicosis
Many Penicillium species and a number of Aspergillus
species, including A. flavus, produce cyclopiazonic acid
Some strains of P. camembertii, used in the production of
gourmet cheese, also produce cyclopiazonic acid. This
mycotoxin is an indole tetrameric acid which acts as a
specific inhibitor of calcium-dependent ATPase and
affects iontransport
across
　cell
membranes.The
mycotoxin is produced by particular fungi growing on
stored grain or meal. Weakness, anorexia and loss of body
weighthave
been
 described
1  in  pigs   consuming
contaminated meal. In chickens, cyclopiazonic acid
decreases feed conversion, interferes with weight gain and
may cause mortality. Consumption of mouldy millet
containing cyclopiazonic acid has been linked to kodua
poisoning in humans, characterized by somnolence, nausea
and tremors.
Diplodiosis
Ingestion of the toxin produced by Diplodia maydis, the
corn cob rot fungus growing on maize cobs, causes a
disease called diplodiosis in farm animals. Contaminated
cobs fed to animals or ingested by animals grazing fields
where maize has been harvested produce disease in cattle.
sheep, goats and horses. The condition has been recorded
in southern Africa and Argentina. Growth of D. maydis on
cobs over a number of weeks is necessary for toxin
production. An interval of up to 2 weeks may elapse
between
ingestion of contaminated cobs and emergence of clinical
signs.Prominent
t clinical
signs
include stiffness,
1257
incoordination, ataxia and paralysis. In some outbreaks of
diplodiosis in cattle, the mortality rate may approach 40%
(Odriozola et al., 2005 ). Signs of illness disappear when
contaminated corn is removed from the diet. Exposure of
pregnant ewes and cows during the second half of
pregnancy results in stillbirths and neonatal deaths.
Spongiform lesions may be found in a high percentage of
the brains of affected lambs and calves; vacuolation of
myelin sheaths and swelling of astrocytes have been
recorded in adult cattle
Ergotism
This disease, which occurs worldwide in many domestic
animal species and in humans, follows ingestion of toxic
levels of certain ergopeptide alkaloids found in the
sclerotia of  Claviceps purpurea. This fungal  species
colonizes the seed heads of ryegrasses and cereals such as
rye and barley. Toxicity may be retained in silage (Hogg,
1991). Ovarian tissue of the seed is destroyed and replaced
by fungal mycelium which enlarges, hardens and darkens
to form a sclerotium, also referred to as an ergot (Fig

BC refers to a ^noxious pustule in the ear of grain’ thought
to be a reference to ergot (Sanders-Bush and Mayer, 2006).
Mature sclerotia, shed from seed heads in autumn and
overwintering in the soil, germinate in the following
spring. They produce stromata bearing perithecia in which
asci,  containing
ascospores, develop. Windborme
ascospores, forcibly discharged from the perithecia,
germinate on suitable grasses and cereal plants to form a
new  generation  of  sclerotia.  The most important
ergopeptide alkaloids in the sclerotia are ergotamine,
1258
ergometrine and other derivatives of lysergic acid
(Coppock and Jacobsen, 2009). These alkaloids have a
number of  pharmacological effects  including  direct
stimulation of the adrenergic nerves supplying arteriolar
smooth muscle and inhibition of prolactin secretion.

sclerotium
Clinical findings
Convulsive ergotism, an uncommon acute form of the
disease, is occasionally observed in cattle, sheep and
horses exposed to large doses of ergotamine. Signs include
staggering, convulsive episodes and drowsiness. Smaller
amounts of mycotoxin absorbed over relatively long
periods result  in  persistent arteriolar  constriction  and
endothelial damage. The effects of these changes, most
noticeable in body extremities, are thrombosis and
ischaemia. Swelling and redness of the extremities
accompanied by lameness and stiffness are followed by
terminal gangrene. There is a clear line of demarcation
1259
between non-viable and viable normal tissues. Cold
ambient temperatures and muddy conditions under foot
may contribute to the severity of the lesions. In chickens,
dry gangrene of the comb, wattles and feet may develop.
In warm climates, hyperthermia may occur in cattle
ingesting ergopeptide alkaloids (Ross et al., 1989 ). In

starvation.  Although ergopeptides may  exert an
oxytocin-like effect on the pregnant uterus, abortion is not
a feature of ergotism.

Prevention
·If ergots are confirmed in pasture, an immediate change to
ergot-free pasture should take place.
·Regular grazing or topping to prevent seed-head formation
in pasture grasses reduces the possibility of sclerotia

·Grain containing ergots should not be fed to animals.
Removal of ergots from small batches of grain can be
achieved mechanically or by flotation methods.
Facial eczema
1260
The saprophyte fungus Pithomyces chartarum, which
grows on dead plant material at the base of growing
pasture, causes facial eczema in grazing ruminants. Sheep,
cattle and farmed deer are the species most severely
affected by this mycotic disease. This economically
important disease, which is seasonally common in New
Zealand, also occurs in Australia, South Africa, South
America and, to a limited extent, parts of Europe. In this
disease, the skin lesions develop as a result of
photosensitization following exposure to the hepatotoxin
sporidesmin in the spores of the saprophytic fungus
Pithomyces chartarum. The fungus sporulates prolifically
 u s pn m lnp n asnd uo

chartarum isolated in New Zealand produce sporidesmin,
       g
in other countries (Collin and Towers, 1995).
Hepatobiliarylesions  develop  as  a  result  of the
accumulation and concentration of sporidesmin in the bile
Necrosis of biliary epithelium results in obstruction of
intrahepatic ducts with cell debris and diffusion of toxin
into the hepatic parenchyma producing damage to blood
vessels and hepatocytes. The consequent atrophy, necrosis
and fbrosis reduce the capacity of the liver to excrete
phylloerythrin, a potent photodynamic compound formed
from chlorophyll
by
yenteric organisms, which
is
distributed to many tissues including the skin. The
photodynamic activity of phylloerythrin when exposed to
solar radiation produces skin lesions typical of the disease
Clinical findings
1261
There is a latent period of 10 to 14 days between ingestion
of a toxic amount of sporidesmin and the development of
photosensitization.
In  sheep,
lesions   develop
11
non-pigmented areas which are not covered by wool. The
eyelids, muzzle and ears are inflamed and swollen. Serous
exudation and scab formation may be followed by necrosis
and sloughing of skin. Jaundice is usually present. In
cattle, lesions are limited to areas of non-pigmented skin.
Milk production may be severely reduced. Although
mortality due to severe liver damage is limited, economic
losses arising from debilitation may be considerable.
Diagnosis
· In ruminants, photosensitization accompanied by jaundice is
Suggestive of the disease.
· Environmental temperatures above 12°C along with heavy
rainfall over a 48-hour period provide suitable conditions for
the growth of P. chartarum on pasture and are likely to
precipitate disease outbreaks.
Counts of the characteristic spores of P. chartarum (Fig.
51.3) in pasture samples can be used for prediction of
disease outbreaks. Pastures with high spore counts are toxic
for grazing animals.
· Elevated serum liver enzymes such as gamma-glutamyl
transferase are found in affected animals.
Competitive ELISA techniques have been developed for
field use. Sporidesmin may be detected in bile, urine, plasma
or whole blood (Briggs et al., 1993 ).

(10-20  x 20-30μm) with transverse and longitudinal
septa.
1262
Control and prevention
·  Routine monitoring of pasture spore counts can be used to
evaluate their safety for grazing.
Spore formation by P. chartarum can be controlled by
spraying pastures with benzimidazole fungicides.
Accumulation of pasture litter can be controlled by pasture
management techniques.
 Breeding programmes which select sheep resistant to the
toxic effects of sporidesmin are employed in some countries.
The administration of high doses of zinc to sheep and cattle
by drenching with zinc oxide or zinc sulphate in drinking
water, before ingestion of sporidesmin, has been shown to
reduce sporidesmininduced liver damage. Zinc forms a
stable mercaptide with reduced sporidesmin, removing it
from the auto-oxidation cycle that leads to the generation of
reactive oxygen radicals which cause cell damage and cell
death (Smith and Towers, 2002). For large flocks where
daily drenching is impractical, slow-release intraruminal
boluses containing zinc, which can produce protection for up
to 4 weeks, have been developed and are available
commercially.
Fescue toxicosis
Tall fescue grass, Festuca arundinacea, is a perennial
grass adapted to a wide range of soil types and climatic
conditions. It is common in pastures in large areas of the
USA and also grows in Australia and New Zealand. Two
1263
diseases are associated with tall fescue grass, summer
fescue toxicosis and fescue lameness.
Summer fescue toxicosis
This condition occurs in cattle when ambient temperatures
are high, typically above 30²C. High environmental
temperatures induce hyperthermia in animals grazing tall
fescue pasture contaminated with the endophytic fungus
Neotyphodium  coenophialum.  Clinical  signs  associated
with the hyperthermia include dyspnoea, inappetence and
hypersalivation. Affected cattle move into wet areas and
seek shade. Reduction in prolactin levels and reduced milk
yield are features of this condition. In addition to agalactia.
prolonged gestation, weak neonates and thickened
placentae have been associated with this toxicosis. The
mycotoxin ergovaline has been implicated in the aetiology
of summer fescue toxicosis (Fink-Gremmels, 2008). The
hyperthermia observed in this condition is attributed to the
peripheral  vasoconstriction  caused   by   the  mycotoxin
which shares some common features with ergot alkaloids.
Other aspects of this condition are attributed
[to
ergovaline's action as a dopamine receptor agonist.
Fescue lameness
Unlike summer fescue toxicosis, fescue lameness is
associated with late autumn or early winter. Clinical signs
of fescue lameness resemble ergotism in herbivores.
Severe lameness is followed by gangrene and sloughing of
the extremities, especially digits. Lesion development is
attributed to the vasoconstrictive action of ergovaline
produced  by  Neotyphodium
coenophialum.
The
1264
vasoconstrictive activity of ergovaline is exacerbated by
low ambient temperatures. There are suggestions that a
number   of
f   mycotoxins  may
be  involved in   the
development of fescue lameness.
Fumonisin toxicoses
Fumonisins are produced by a number of Fusarium
species, notably
FusariumverticillioidesandF.
proliferatum and at least ten other species. By interfering
with
 sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism,  these
mycotoxins affect animals and humans in different ways.
Horses and pigs are more susceptible to the toxic effects of
fumonisins than cattle, sheep and poultry. Through their
interference with folic acid metabolism, fumonisins have
been associated with neural tube defects in humans
(Coppock and Jacobsen, 2009). Fumonisin B1 has been
linked to oesophageal cancer in people living in regions of
South Africa, China, Italy and the USA (Bennett and
Klich, 
20032.
This
mycotoxin
 causes
leukoencephalomalacia in horses, pulmonary oedema and
hydrothorax in pigs, and hepatotoxic and carcinogenic
effects in rats.
Mycotoxic leukoencephalomalacia
Fusarium species are commonly found growing on mouldy
maize affected by rain or when stored with a high moisture
content. Because most strains of the fungus do not produce
toxin, the presence of the fungus is not indicative of
fumonisin production. At least six fumonisins, namely B1,
B2, B3, B4, A1 and A2, are known but fumonisin Bl is the
most frequent cause of toxicity in animals, especially
1265
horses (Conkova et al., 2003). Ingestion of mouldy maize
cobs containing the mycotoxin fumonisin Bi, which is
produced by Fusarium verticillioides, is responsible for
sporadic neurological disease, mainly in horses, donkeys
and mules. The disease has been reported from Egypt,
South Africa, the USA and Greece. Neurological signs,
which relate to liquefactive necrosis of the white matter in
the cerebrum, include inability to swallow, weakness,
staggering, circling and marked depression. Mania.
described in some cases, may be due to hepatic failure.
Fumonisin Bl, when fed to horses at concentrations
greater than 10 μg/g of feed, is lethal (Ross et al., 1991).
Porcine pulmonary oedema
Fumonisins Bl and B2 are associated with fatal pulmonary
oedema in pigs. This condition, which can result from
consumption of fumonisin Bl at dietary concentrations
above 1o0 ppm, appears to be caused by pulmonary
hypertension   resulting  in   pulmonary   oedema
a and
hydrothorax. Chronic exposure to fumonisins is associated
with hepatotoxicosis.
Mouldy sweet potato toxicity
Acute interstitial pneumonia in cattle has been attributed to
eating mould-damaged sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas)
in the USA, New Zealand and Australia. Phytoalexins.
metabolites formed in sweet potatoes in response to
structural damage, are metabolized by Fusarium solani
and F. semitectum to lung oedema factor, 4-i pomeanol.
This factor is converted
1266
by microsomal enzymes in pneumocytes to toxic products
which damage the cells (Hill and Wright, 1992). Dyspnoea
is the principal clinical sign. Death may occur within 10
hours of the onset of signs.
Mycotoxic lupinosis
Lupin seeds contain toxic alkaloids which can produce
neurological disturbance in herbivores. This plant toxicosis
is distinct from the mycotoxicosis associated with
ingestion   of  peptide   mycotoxins  called   phomopsins
produced by Diaporthe toxica, the fungal cause of stem
blight in lupins. Diaporthe toxica, a saprophytic fungus,
produces stem damage and also grows on dead lupin
material and affects pods and seeds. Summer rain is
conducive to fungal growth. Cattle and sheep grazing
stubble of lupin crops are susceptible to the mycotoxins
produced by the fungus.
Five mycotoxins, A, B, C, D and E, are produced by
Diaporthe toxica, and pathological changes attributable to
consumption of phomopsins include hepatosis, muscle
injury and kidney damage. The disease is important in
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and parts of Europe.

phomopsin toxicity has been reported in Western Australia
(Allen et al., 1992). In sheep, oral administration of zinc is
reported to reduce the severity of liver damage caused by
phomopsins.
1267
Ochratoxicosis
Agroup of related isocoumarins, referred to as
ochratoxins, are produced by numerous toxigenic strains of
Aspergillus species and Penicillium species. In temperate
climates, P. verrucosum is associated with production of
these mycotoxins; in tropical climates A. alutaceus and
related species produce ochratoxins. Numerous Aspergillus
species have the ability to produce these mycotoxins in
stored grain with a high moisture content. Although
ochratoxins are found principally in cereal grains such as
barley, oats, rye, wheat and maize, they have been detected
in animal by-products and also in fresh fruit, grape juice
and wine (Moss, 2008).
Four ochratoxins, A, B, C and D, have been described and
ochratoxin A is the most common and the most toxic

s       
Ochratoxin A is a heat-stable, potent nephrotoxin which is
also immunosuppressive and carcinogenic. Many of the
biological effects of ochratoxin A relate to interference
with protein synthesis.
In pigs, inappetence, depression, weight loss, polydipsia
and polyuria are features of this mycotoxic nephropathy.
Dogs are reported to be extremely sensitive to ochratoxin

shows many common features with the degenerative renal
lesions caused by ochratoxin A in pigs. However, the
aetiology of this human nephropathy is not yet determined.
Mycotoxic oestrogenism
A number of Fusarium species including F. graminearum,
F. culmorum, F. equiseti and F. crookwellense growing on
mouldy maize, maize stubble, oats, barley, wheat, rye and
rice produce oestrogenic substances, notably zearalenone.
Pasture levels of zearalenone may be sufficient in some
countries to cause reproductive problems in sheep and
cattle (Smith and Towers, 2002). Zearalenone is a potent,
non-steroidal oestrogen and both it and its metabolites can
bind to oestrogen receptors inducing a syndrome in
animals referred to as hyperoestrogenism (Fink-Gremmels,
2008).Asecondary1
metabolite  of  zearalenone,
α-zearalenol, has been marketed as a growth-promoting
agent. While still available in some countries, it was
banned by the European Union in 1989.
The majority of mycotoxins exert either a direct or indirect
toxic effect on cells, tissues or organs. Although described
as a mycotoxin, zearalenone does not conform to the usual
description of a fungal toxin either in its molecular
structure or in its biological activity. Its undesirable effects
on fertility in some species, however, and its ability to
induce pathological changes in some reproductive organs
place it in a separate category. Although pigs are
considered to be the most sensitive animal species to
1269
zearalenone, young female calves are also susceptible.
Clinical
Isigns
  of   hyperoestrogenism   are   observed
infrequently in ruminating cows.
Pigs, particularly prepubertal gilts, are commonly affected
by oestrogenism. The condition, sometimes
erroneously called vulvovaginitis, develops about a week
after ingestion of contaminated feed. Vulval oedema and
and, occasionally, vaginal and rectal prolapse are features
in gilts. In sows, anoestrus, pseudopregnancy, infertility
and reduced litter size with small weak piglets may suggest
oestrogenism (Long and Diekman, 1986).
Low conception rates have been recorded in cattle and
sheep with oestrogenism. Less frequently, affected cattle
may present with vaginal discharge, nymphomania and
abnormal mammary development in prepubertal heifers.
Zearalenone can be excreted in milk, posing a public
health risk. As the mycotoxin can be detected by
chromatography, isolation and identification of the specific
fungus may not be required. Oestrogen activity in feed
may be assayed by injection of extracts into sexually
immature mice, which develop uterine hypertrophy when
extracts are positive. An ELISA technique has been
developed for detecting zearalenone in pasture samples
and ovine urine.
Patulin toxicosis
Although first used as an antimicrobial agent more than 60
years ago, patulin was later reclassified as a mycotoxin.
Currently, patulin is considered of greater importance in
1270
human medicine than in veterinary medicine. This
mycotoxin is produced by a number of fungi including
Penicillium, Aspergillus and Byssochlamys species.Patulin
has been detected in rotten fruit, apple juice and mouldy
bread. Penicillium expansum, the blue mould that causes
soft rot of apples, pears and other fruit, is recognized as
one of the most common producers of this mycotoxin.
Patulin is commonly present in apple juice and surveys
indicate that from 21% to 100% of samples analysed
contained this mycotoxin (Moss, 2008). However, unlike
the majority of mycotoxins, patulin, a polyketide, is a
relatively unstable molecule. While it is stable in the
weakly acidic conditions of apple juice, it does not survive
the fermentation into cider products.
Because patulin has broad antimicrobial activity against
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and protozoa, it
has a negative
effecton ruminalmicroflora
(Fink-Gremmels,  2008). Intoxication  associated with
patulin ingestion by cattle may result in tremors, ataxia and
recumbency. The antimicrobial effects of patulin alter the
functioning of rumen microflora, and the consequences of
these changes, which are distinctly different from typical
mycotoxins, may result in acidosis, poor feed utilization,
loss of body weight and diarrhoea with undigested fibres in
the faeces.
Experimental studies in dogs indicate that patulin affects
the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhoea, lethargy,
     
predominant clinical signs observed. When fed to young
pigs, clinical signs included vomiting, salivation, anorexia
and weight loss.
1271
Slaframine toxicosis
The phytopathogen Rhizoctonia leguminicola causes
black-patch disease when growing on red clover, alfalfa.
soya bean and other legumes. Transmission of the fungus
seems to be seed-borne and it survives seasonal growth
cycles in plant tissues and on plant debris. On red clover
seeds, the fungus may survive for up to 2 years. High
temperatures accompanied by high humidity favour fungal
growth
Rhizoctonialeguminicolaproduces
 two indolizidine
alkaloids, slaframine and swainsonine. Horses are
particularly sensitive to the action of slaframine, and
profuse salivation develops within hours of consuming
contaminated plant material (Wijnberg et al., 2009). Cattle,
sheep and goats are also susceptible to slaframine toxicity.
Other clinical
1signs
  include  excessive  lacrimation,
bloating, diarrhoea and polyuria. In hay, silage or forage
which contains contaminated clover, toxin remains active
for several months. Slaframine intoxication has been
described in many regions of the USA and in Canada,
Japan, France and The Netherlands. Recovery usually
follows removal of contaminated material from the
animal's diet and mortality is uncommon.
Sterigmatocystin toxicosis
As a precursor in the synthetic pathway for aflatoxins.
sterigmatocystin is considered to be capable of causing
liver damage and to be carcinogenic. Although similar in
many respects to aflatoxins, sterigmatocystin is considered
to be much less toxic. Sterigmatocystin-producing fungi
1272
include Aspergillus versicolor, A. flavus, A. niduellus, A.
terreus and Bipolaris sorokiniana. This mycotoxin has
been found in stored wheat flour, cereals, peanuts, dry
beans, cheese and green coffee.
Dysentery, decreased milk production and deaths occurred
in dairy cattle following ingestion of food contaminated
with sterigmatocystin-producing strains of A. versicolor
(Coppock and Jacobsen, 2009).
Tremorgen intoxications
Tremorgens, a heterogeneous group of mycotoxins,
produce neurological effects including muscular
tremors, ataxia, incoordination and convulsive seizures
following ingestion. Signs often develop after strenuous
exercise or excitement. Recovery usually follows within
hours of removal from contaminated pasture or withdrawal
of contaminated feed. Most tremorgens produce their
neurological effects without obvious morphological tissue
changes. Unidentified neurotoxins of Aspergillus clavatus
can  cause  neuronal  degeneration   and focal  gliosis
(Gilmour et al., 1989 ).
Perennial ryegrass staggers
This neurotoxic condition of grazing livestock, which
occurs in the late spring and summer, causes muscular
tremors, ataxia and other neurological signs in sheep,
cattle, horses and farmed deer. Perennial ryegrass staggers
occurs sporadically in North and South America, Australia,
New Zealand and parts of Europe. This disease occurs
1273
ryegrasses   are   the  predominant  grasses 
 present.
Neotyphodium lolii, an endophytic fungus growing on
perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), produces a number of
mycotoxins  called
lolitrems.
Thesetremorgenic
neurotoxins, especially lolitrem B, are responsible for the
clinical   signs  observed   in  ryegrass  staggers.   The
tremorigenic neurotoxins are indole diterpene alkaloids
and include paxilline, lolitrem B and a number of other
compounds (Smith and Towers, 2002; Fink-Gremmels,
2008). Fungal invasion and the amount of lolitrem B in
infected plant material increase to toxic levels as the
temperature rises in late spring, whereas toxic levels
decline as the temperature falls later in the year. Growth of
N. lolii is largely concentrated in older leaf sheaths, flower
stalks and seeds. Consequently, clinical signs usually
develop in late summer or early autumn when growth of
pasture grasses declines. Infected plants do not exhibit
signs of fungal infestation. Animals fed on contaminated
hay or silage may develop clinical signs.
Perennial ryegrass staggers may affect many animals in a
flock or herd but deaths are rare and recovery is gradual if
animals  are  removed
1fromcontaminated
I pasture.
Neurotoxic tremorgens may cause  incoordination by
interfering with neuronal transmission in the cerebral
cortex; histological lesions relating to the activity of these
neurotoxins have not been reported
Paspalum staggers
Tremorgens present in the sclerotia of Claviceps paspali.
growing on the seed heads of paspalum grasses, produce
incoordination and ataxia in cattle, sheep and horses
1274
grazing contaminated grasses. The life cycle of C. paspali
resembles that of C. purpurea. Paspalum staggers is
caused
by the indole
terpenoids
 paspalinine
and
paspalitrems A, B and C. These mycotoxins share some
common features with paxilline and lolitrems, implicated
in perennial ryegrass staggers. The clinical signs observed
in paspalum staggers are similar to those that occur in
perennial ryegrass staggers. Death is rare but may occur
from respiratory
 failure
during sustained
Iseizures.
Recovery is gradual after animals are removed from
contaminated pasture. Control may be achieved by topping
of pastures to prevent development of paspalum seed
heads.
Penitrem staggers and related conditions
A number of neurological diseases, often collectively
referred to as penitrem staggers, are attributed to
mycotoxins produced by many Penicillium species and
also by Aspergillus species growing on pasture plants or
stored feed.  Tremorgenic mycotoxins associated with
diseases in dogs are usually produced during food spoilage
(Leung e t al., 2006 ). Tremorgens produced by
Penicillium species include penitrems A, B and C,
verruculogen and roquefortine. Penitrem A, the most toxic
tremorgen mycotoxin associated with Penicillium species,
is produced by P. crustosum. Roquefortine is produced by
P. roqueforti and can be produced by many other
Penicillium species including P. crustosum. Tremorgenic
mycotoxins associated with Aspergillus species include
fumitremorgen A and B produced by A. fiumigatus and
flavus tremorgen produced by A. flavus.
1275
In livestock, the clinical signs produced by these
mycotoxins are similar to those observed with ryegrass
staggers. Two  tremorgenic  mycotoxins  of  clinical
importance in dogs are penitrem A and roquefortine
(Puschner, 2002). Mouldy cheese, bread and decaying
organic matter are the most likely sources of these
mycotoxins. Clinical signs, which occur soon after
ingestion of toxic food by dogs, include weakness, muscle
tremors, rigidity, seizures and recumbency. A body
temperature greater than 40?C has been observed in some
affected dogs. Induced emesis and gastric lavage is
recommended when marked toxicity is evident
Trichothecene toxicoses
The trichothecene mycotoxins constitute a large and
diverse group of sesquiterpenoid compounds produced by
species of Fusarium,
Myrothecium,Cephalosporium,
Stachybotrys, Trichoderma and Trichothecium. The term
trichothecene derives from trichothecin, one of the first
members of the family identified (Bennett and Klich,
2003). On the basis of their molecular structure, the
trichothecenes are grouped as
non-macrocyclic and macrocyclic compounds. Fusarium is
the major genus associated with the production of
non-macrocyclic   compounds.   The
 macrocy- clic
trichothecenes are produced by Myrothecium, Stachybotrys
and Trichothecium species. Trichothecenes inhibit protein
synthesis in eukarytotic cells. They inhibit mitochondrial
functions and induce apoptosis. These mycotoxins have
radiomimetic effects in tissues, and immunosuppression
results from sublethal doses of trichothecenes.
1276
Because of the complex nature of the mvcotoxins involved
and  the marked differences in  clinical presentation
observed in avian and mammalian species to individual
trichothecene mycotoxins, specific names are not usually
assigned   to   diseases  attributed   to  nonmacrocyclic
trichothecene-related diseases. Broader terms such as food
refusal and emetic syndrome are sometimes applied to
these conditions. In contrast, diseases associated with
macrocyclic  trichothecenes produced by  Myrothecium,
Stachybotrys and Trichothecium species are more clearly
defined and have been assigned specific names.
A number of toxigenic fungi involved in the production of
non-macrocyclic trichothecene toxicoses can produce more
than one mycotoxin. Accordingly, a number of mycotoxins
may contribute to syndromes attributed to a single
mycotoxin  produced by a particular toxigenic fungus
Another difficulty with this group of diseases is that the
mycotoxins responsible for some syndromes associated
with trichothecene toxicoses are not yet specified. The
syndromes associated with toxigenic Fusarium species in
pigs and other animals include feed refusal, emesis,
anorexia, mucosal haemorrhages and necrotic skin lesions.
Fusariumspecies are often found on barley, maize, rye,
wheat and mixed cereals in regions of the world with
temperate climates.
Deoxynivalenol toxicosis
Production of deoxynivalenol is associated with Fusarium
graminearum,F.culmorum and a number of other
Fusarium species growing on maize, barley, wheat and
other cereals. Deoxynivalenol is one of the most common
1277
mycotoxins found in cereals. Wet seasons and warm
weather promote growth of Fusarium species on feed
components.
Feed contaminated with deoxynivalenol is unpalatable for
many farm animals, especially pigs. Even low levels of
this mycotoxin in feed result in food refusal, vomiting,
digestive disturbances and weight loss in pigs. The potent
emetic activity of this mycotoxin (its synonym
1is
vomitoxin) is evident in pigs, dogs and cats but ruminants
are comparatively resistant to its activity. Decreased feed
contaminated with deoxynivalenol (Conkova et al., 2003)
In addition to its toxic effects on the gastrointestinal tract
in many species, deoxynivalenol is reported to have
teratogenic activity in rats (Coppock and Jacobsen, 2009).
Because more than one trichothecene mycotoxin may be
present in contaminated feed, the clinical syndromes
associated with deoxynivalenol toxicity are not clearly
established.
T-2 toxicosis
Fusarium species associated with production of T-2 toxin
include F. sporotrichioides and F. poae. During World
War H, a serious disease in the Russian population,
alimentary  toxic aleukia,
,was associatedwiththe
consumptionofmouldy
wheatcontaminatedwith
toxigenic  Fusarium  species.  Clinical  signs  included
mucosal lesions, toxic effects on the bone marrow,
thrombocytopenia   and    haemorrhages.   Although    the
clinical consequences of consumption of T-2 toxin are not
clearly   established
1in  animals,  cytotoxic  activity,
1278
immunosuppression and toxic effects on the bone marrow
have been observed in pigs and cats. Feed refusal of T-2
toxin-contaminated feed occurs with pigs but not with
cattle. When administered to rodents in feeding trials, T-2
toxin induced cytotoxicity, immunosuppression and CNS
signs. Poultry are susceptible to the direct toxic effects of
T-2 toxin. Beak lesions, abnormal feather formation in
chickens, a drop in egg production, tissue haemorrhages
and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases have
been recorded in poultry of different ages (Coppock and
Jacobsen, 2009). Clinical signs observed in cats fed
contaminated rations included vomiting, dysentery, ataxia
and dehydration (Puschner, 2002). Severe irritation of the
has been observed in cattle consuming T-2 toxin in
contaminated feed. Although the clinical spectrum of T-2
toxicity is not uniform in animals, cytotoxicity and
interference with bone marrow activity, resulting in
thrombocytopenia and haemorrhage, are a common
outcome.
Diacetoxyscirpenol toxicosis
Production   of  diacetoxyscirpenol  is   associated   with
Fusarium
a
number
ofother
Fusariumspecies growing on cereals. This mycotoxin,
which is one of the most potent trichothecene toxins, is an
epithelial  necrotizing  agent.   Cellular  depletion  and
necrosis of lymphoid organs, and haemorrhages in the
skin, oral cavity, intestine and major organs, are attributed
to the action of this toxin. The clinical syndrome
associated with diacetoxyscirpenol in cattle includes
1279
mucosal haemorrhages, salivation and depression. In pigs,
haemorrhagic intestinal lesions and emesis are attributed to
the activity of diacetoxyscirpenol. The toxic effects of this
mycotoxin in dogs include depression of bone marrow
activity and associated  haematological  changes.  Oral
lesions involving the beak and tongue have been described
Toxic effects included inhibition of protein synthesis.
Stachybotryotoxicosis
The mycotoxins produced by Stachybotrys chartarum,
macrocyclic trichothecenes, include satratoxins, roridins
and verrucarins. Some isolates produce a range of
additional substances with unspecified biological activity.
Stachybotrys chartarum growing on straw, hay or grain
produces these mycotoxins which are cytotoxic and exert a
radiomimetic effect on tissues. These toxins inhibit DNA
and protein synthesis. Stachybotryotoxicosis has been
reported in the former Soviet Union, parts of Europe and
South Africa. Horses, cattle, sheep and pigs are susceptible
and fungal spores produced by S. chartarum are toxic for
humansfollowing
contact,  ingestion  or inhalation
(Coppock and Jacobsen, 2009). Clinical signs of toxicity 1n
animals include diarrhoea, dysentery, haemorrhages on
nasal and oral mucosae and epistaxis. Agranulocytosis is a
feature of the intoxication, and immunosuppression
predisposes animals to opportunistic infections. Horses
and, in addition to haemorrhages, myositis is reported in
affected animals. Chronic exposure to the mycotoxins may
have fatal consequences, resulting from a combination of
haemorrhage and septicaemia
1280
Myrotheciotoxicosis
Sudden deaths in sheep and cattle have been attributed to
the mycotoxin roridin produced by Myrothecium roridum
and M. verrucaria growing on ryegrass, white clover
plants in pasture or stored feed. Post-mortem findings
related to the mycotoxin included abomasitis, hepatitis and
pulmonary congestion. Prolonged exposure to sublethal
amounts  of roridin may cause  weight loss and
unthriftiness.

Pathogenic algae and cyanobacteria
Algae are saprophytic eukaryotic organisms which are
widely distributed in the environment especially in water.
Many contain chlorophyll. Infrequently, some species of
algae have been implicated in disease of domestic animals
(Table 52.1). Colourless eukaryotic algae belonging to the
genus Prototheca can invade tissues causing cutaneous and
disseminated disease in a number of species and mastitis in
cattle. Green algae belonging to Chlorella species have
been associated with tissue invasion in ruminants on rare
occasions. The prokaryotic cyanobacteria (formerly known
as blue-green algae) produce potent toxins which can
affect hepatic and neurological function.
Prototheca species
Prototheca species, widely distributed, saprophytic.
colourless algae, are related to green algae of the genus
Chlorella. It is thought that Prototheca species may be
achlorophyllous
descendents  of  Chlorella  species
Prototheca zopfii has been associated with disseminated
protothecosis in dogs and with mastitis in cows. Three
biotypes of P. zopfii have been described (Roesler et al.
2003). Subsequent studies based on sequence analysis of
the 18S rRNA gene have led to the proposal that P. zopfii
should be reclassified as genotypes 1 (biotype 1) and 2
(biotype 2), and a new species P. blaschkeae(biotype 3)
(Roesler et al., 2006 ). The majority of bovine protothecal
mastitis cases are caused by P. zopfii genotype 2 (Moller et
1286
al., 2007 ). Cutaneous protothecosis in cats and dogs is
caused byP.wickerhamii.Protothecaspecies grow
aerobically forming yeast-like colonies on Sabouraud
dextrose agar and on blood agar. During
asexual
reproduction, 2 to 16 sporangiospores develop within a
sporangium (Fig. 52.1). The sporangiospores are released
cultures, the sporangiospores of P. zopfii are larger than
those of P. wickerhami(Pore, 2005).

1288
Infections due to Prototheca species are opportunistic.
Organisms can enter tissues at sites of minor trauma in
skin and mucous membranes or through the teat canal.
Some outbreaks in cattle have been associated with the use
of contaminated intramammary products.
Diagnostic procedures
·Suitable specimens for laboratory examination include milk
samples and biopsy or post-mortem tissues. An indirect
serum and whey (Roesler et al., 2001).
· Methenamine silver or PAS techniques can be used to
demonstrate algal cells and sporangia in histological sections
of granulomatous lesions.
· Immunofluorescent techniques are used to identify P. zopfii
and P. wickerhamii in tissues.
·The organisms grow on blood agar and Sabouraud dextrose
agar without cyclohexamide. Organisms may be isolated
from contaminated  specimens  on  prototheca isolation
medium with added phthalate and 5-fluorocytosine (Pore,
2005 ). Culture plates are incubated aerobically at 35°C to
37°C for 2 to 5 days
·Carbohydrate assimilation test kits  for differentiating
Prototheca species are available commercially. Prototheca
wickerhamii assimilates trehalose but not l-propanol,
whereas P. zopfi assimilates I-propanol but not trehalose.
·Identification criteria for isolates:
- Colonial morphology
- Microscopic appearance of sporangiospores
-Carbohydrate assimilation tests.
· Molecular methods are available for the identification of P.
zopfii (On0zaki et al., 2009).
1289
Clinical infections
Although Prototheca species are commonly present in the
environment,  infections   in  animals are  infrequent
Suppression of cell-mediated immunity may be a factor
predisposing to disseminated disease (Migaki et al., 1981).
Cutaneous protothecosis in cats
A cutaneous form of protothecosis,  caused by P
wick-erhamii, is the only manifestation of the disease
reported in cats (Dillberger et al., 1988). Large, firm,
discrete nodules occur on limbs and feet. Similar lesions
have been described on the nose and ears and at the base of
the tail. Microscopically the granulomatous lesions,
located in the dermis, contain multinucleate giant cells
with engulfed organisms. Surgical excision of skin lesions
is the most effective method of treatment. Ketoconazole
therapy is often ineffective.
Disseminated protothecosis in dogs
Infection with P. zopfii probably occurs through the
haemorrhagic colitis (Migaki et al., 1981; Stenner et al.,
2007 ). Affected dogs may present with protracted bloody
diarrhoea along with signs of neurological or ocular
disturbance. There may be progressive weight loss and
debility. Treatment of disseminated protothecosis is
usually unsuccessful. At post-mortem, granulomatous
lesions in which protothecal cells may be demonstrated are
found in skeletal muscles, brain, liver, kidneys, eyes and
cochlea. In addition to disseminated protothecosis, a
1290
cutaneous form caused by P. wickerhamii has been
recorded (Ginel et al., 1997).
Protothecal mastitis in cows
Prototheca
zopfii
　can　cause
 chronic   progressive
pyogranulomatous lesions in bovine mammary glands
and associated lymph nodes. Indurative mastitis may affect
a number of quarters. Because of their intracellular
location, protothecal cells may be difficult to eliminate
from the glands. Although the organisms are excreted
intermittently in milk, they may not be demonstrable in
samples, and some cases of the disease may be overlooked
(Spalton, 1985 ). Prototheca zopfii can persist in the
tissues throughout a dry period and may be excreted during
the next lactation. Treatment is unsuccessful. Affected
cows should be culled because they are potential sources
of infection and their milk yields are permanently reduced.
Disseminated protothecosis has been recorded in cattle on
rare occasions (Taniyama et al., 1994).
Chlorella species
S        
Chlorella
specles
are
morphologically  similar
Prototheca species. However, they are photosynthetic,
possessing chloroplasts containing green pigment which
imparts colour to infected tissues. The organisms have
been recovered from liver and associated lymph nodes of
sheep (Zakia et al., 1989) and, in Australia, from cattle
with lymphadenitis (Rogers et al., 1980 ). Disseminated
chlorellosis has been described in a dog (Quigley et al.
2009).
1291
The cyanobacteria
The    cyanobacteria    are    prokaryotic    photosynthetic
organisms found worldwide in fresh and marine water and
in soil. Blue-green ‘algal’ blooms may form when
conditions allow rapid replication of cyanobacteria. They
may occur in water enriched with phosphates or nitrogen,
when its temperature is between 15°C and 30°C, its pH is
neutral or alkaline, and wind disturbance is minimal
(Carmichael, 1994 ). In these circumstances, domestic or
wild animals drinking contaminated water are likely to be
exposedto toxinreleasedfrom theorganisms
(Lopez-Rodas et al., 2008). More than 40 species of
cyanobacteria are known to produce potent hepatotoxins or
neurotoxins. Selected cyanobacteria, presumed to be
toxigenic, are listed in Box 52.1. Microcystis aeruginosa is
the species most often incriminated in episodes of
poisoning. Some species such as Anabaena flos-aquae can
generate both hepatotoxin and neurotoxin.
Cyanobacterial toxicoses
Toxins of the cyanobacteria, their modes of action and
their clinical effects are presented in Table 52.2. Although
death may occur within a short time after ingestion of a
lethal dose of toxin, the dose-response curve is relatively
steep and animals can ingest nearly 90% of a lethal dose
without noticeable effects. The severity of intoxication
depends on the degree of exposure and the toxin
concentration in contaminated water. Birds and ruminants
are usually more susceptible to the toxins than monogastric
animals.

Clinical signs
Clinical signs, which relate to the types of toxin ingested.
may be diverse. Hepatotoxic effects, which may develop
within hours of exposure, include muscle tremors,
dyspnoea, blood-stained diarrhoea and coma (Kerr et al.,
1987 ). Hepatomegaly may be detectable. Photosensitive
dermatitis has been recorded in horses and ruminants.
Signs of neurotoxicosis, which may develop within
minutes of ingesting toxin, include hypersalivation, clonic
convulsions, rigor and cyanosis (Gunn et al., 1992 ). Death
may occur rapidly after the onset of clinical signs
Diagnosis
·There may be a history of access to contaminated water with
an 'algal' bloom(James et al., 1997; Puschner et al., 2008).
·The mouth or legs of affected animals may be stained green.
· Samples of bloom should be examined microscopically for
the presence of cyanobacteria.
· Toxin must be demonstrated in the bloom or in stomach
contents by chemical, biological or immunoassay techniques
in a reference laboratory.
·There may be histopathological evidence of hepatotoxicosis.
· Serum concentrations of bile acids and liver enzymes may
be elevated (Carbis et al., 1995).
Other possible sources of intoxication should be considered
in the differential diagnosis.
Treatment
·Affected horses and ruminants, removed from the source of
toxin, should be housed out of direct sunlight.
· Emetics administered to recently exposed dogs may aid
recovery.
1294
·Activated charcoal slurry or ion-exchange resins may be
used for adsorbing toxins from the gastrointestinal tract.
·Although atropine reduces the anti-acetylcholinesterase
activity of anatoxin-a(s), no therapeutic antagonist is
effective against anatoxin-a or the saxitoxins.
Control
·Access of animals to contaminated water must be restricted.
· Companion animals should not be fed fish from
contaminated waters.
· Growth of cyanobacteria can be controlled in small bodies of
water by the addition of copper sulphate. However,
treatment of an 'algal' bloom with algicides results in the
liberation of toxins from dead cells into the water.

Antifungal chemotherapy
Fewer than 200 species of fungi are capable of causing
infection in otherwise healthy humans and animals. A
  s     
opportunistic fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans,
CryptococcusneoformansandAspergillusfumigatus
These opportunistic infections usually occur in hosts which
are   debilitated
or
immunosuppressed. Prolonged
administration
of
antibacterial
drugs
or
immunosuppressive agentspredisposes
humans
 and
animals to opportunistic fungal infections.
Based on the initial site of infection, fungal infections can
be classified into a number of broad groups: superficial
mycoses, subcutaneous mycoses and systemic mycoses.
Superficial mycoses are limited to the skin, other
keratinized structures including hair and nails and also
mucous membranes. Subcutaneous mycoses are infections
that involve the dermis, subcutaneous tissues and
occasionally adjacent structures. Systemic mycoses are
infections that usually originate in the lungs and spread to
many other organs. Mycotoxicoses constitute an important
group of diseases which result from the ingestion of fungal
toxins that have been preformed in stored food or standing
crops.
Factors that predispose to opportunistic fungal infections
include alteration of the normal microbial flora as a
consequence of prolonged antibacterial therapy, primary or
1300
secondary
immunodeficiency,
immunosuppression
following
  corticosteroid  therapy, administration of
antineoplastic  drugs, acute viral infections, some
neoplastic conditions and exposure to high infectious doses
of fungal spores in confined spaces. Advanced AIDS is an
important predisposing factor for fungal infections in the
human population. It is unrealistic, therefore, to expect
systems or tissues of immunosuppressed animals or from
animals  with  primary  or  secondary  immunodeficiency
diseases. Accordingly, the host’ s immune status should be
considered carefully when designing antifungal treatment
regimes.
Although there are fewer antifungal drugs currently
available than antibacterial drugs, major advances in
antifungal chemotherapy have taken place in recent years.
There are four major classes of antifungal agents:
allylamines, azoles, echinocandins and polyenes. Other
antifungal compounds include griseoful-vin, flucytosine,
iodides and morpholines. Some of these compounds, such
as allylamines, can be used both topically and systemically
while other antifungal drugs such as amorolfine and
ciclopirox olamine are used topically.
The toxicity of many antifungal drugs used in past decades
limited their therapeutic use in humans and animals. The
availability of newer, less toxic, antifungal compounds
which selectively inhibit fungal growth has resulted in a
range of antifungal drugs with fewer side effects and more
predictable antifungal activity
1301
The modes and sites of action of antifungal drugs range
from compounds that interfere with fungal cell synthesis to
drugs that inhibit mitosis of fungal cells
Prolonged treatment with antifungal drugs is often required
to ensure clinical recovery.
The susceptibilityof
pathogenic fungi to antifungal compounds is not always
predictable. Some fungal pathogens are naturally resistant
to chemotherapeutic drugs
S while other fungal species
gradually  develop resistance  to  antifungal  drugs.  In
contrast to the spread of high-level multidrug resistance
encountered in bacteria, antifungal drug resistance usually
develops slowly.
Fungal pathogens and related organisms that cause disease
options are summarized in Table 53.1. Classification of
antifungal drugs and their modes and sites of action are
summarized in Table 53.2.
Antifungal drugs
Allylamines
These antifungal drugs, which have both fungistatic and
fungicidal activity, are used for treating a range of fungal
pathogens, especially infections with dermatophytes. Two
compounds in this category of synthetic drugs, naftifine
and terbinafine, are used therapeutically. The former is
used as a topical cream for dermatophyte infections, the
latter in  tablet and topical formulations. Allylamines
inhibit the activity of squalene epoxidase, an enzyme
required for the production of ergosterol, the principal
sterol in the membrane of fungal cells. Decreased synthesis
1302
of ergosterol and accumulation of squalene produce a toxic
effect on the fungal pathogen.
Terbinafine, a lipophilic drug, is reported to become
concentrated in the dermis, epidermis, adipose tissue and
nails. It has a broad spectrum of activity which includes
dermatophytes, Aspergillus species, some dimorphic fungi
and yeasts. In the human population, few side effects have
been reported. There are limited data on the clinical use of
terbinafine in dogs and cats but its efficacy against
dermatophytes is of particular relevance in the treatment of
ringworm. Terbinafine has been used successfully for the
treatment of systemic aspergillosis in avian species.
Although primary resistance to terbinafine has been
observed, dermatophyte resistance to this antifungal drug
is reported to be rare.
Griseofulvin
Although griseofulvin was formerly used extensively for
the treatment of dermatophyte infections, it has been
superseded by safer and more effective antifungal drugs.
This orally administered drug has a spectrum of activity
limited to dermatophytes. Griseofulvin, a fungistatic drug,
exerts its effect by binding to microtubular proteins and
interfering with microtubule formation. As a consequence
of its activity, mitosis of fungal cells is inhibited. In
addition, inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis may occur.
Deposition of griseofulvin occurs in keratin precursor cells
and, when these cells differentiate, the drug remains bound
to keratin rendering the cells resistant to fungal invasion.
Griseofulvin is used for treating dermatophyte infections in
large and small animals. Treatment for several weeks may
1303
clinical recovery. Because of its teratogenic effects,
griseofulvin  is  contraindicated
[1n
 pregnant animals,
especially queens and mares.
Some species of dermatophytes develop resistance to
griseofulvin. Data relating to griseofulvin resistance are
limited and the molecular basis of resistance is uncertain.
Azoles
Two chemically different groups of azole compounds,
imidazoles and triazoles, are used therapeutically for their
fungistatic activity (Table 53.2). The antifungal activity of
all azole compounds derives from their ability to inhibit
fungal cytochrome 14-α-demethylase. Inhibition of this
enzyme, which is involved in the conversion of lanosterol
to ergosterol, leads to depletion of ergosterol and
accumulation of 14-o-methylsterols in the fungal cell
activities and the functioning of membrane-bound enzyme
systems. As a consequence of membrane damage, nutrient
transport and chitin synthesis are impaired and fungal
growth ceases. The fungistatic action of azole compounds.
which takes place over several generations of fungi,
becomes clinically evident at a slow rate and, accordingly,
prolonged treatment regimes are required to ensure clinical
recovery.
In contrast to the early azole drugs such as ketoconazole.
fluconazole and itraconazole have a much greater affinity
for  fungal cell membranes than mammalian cell
membranes and these triazoles produce fewer side effects.
1304
In recent years, fluconazole and itraconazole are being
used in preference to ketoconazole for the treatment of
fungal
 infections
in
humans
and
animals.  Both
itraconazole and fluconazole have wider spectra of activity
than ketoconazole. Fluconazole is effective against
dermatophytes,
Candida
species,
Cryptococcus
neoformans, Histoplasma capsula-tum, Coccidioides
immitis and Sporothrix schenckii. It is moderately effective
against Blastomyces dermatitidis but ineffective against
Aspergillus species and zygomycetes. Itraconazole has a
broader antifungal spectrum than fluconazole and, in
addition to the fungal pathogens against which fluconazole
is effective, itra-conazole is active against dematiaceous
fungi
andAspergillus
specles.
In common with
fluconazole,
itraconazole

against
zygomycetes. Voriconazole, a new broad-spectrum triazole
developed to overcome the resistance of fungal pathogens
to fluconazole and itraconazole, is effective against yeasts,
dimorphic fungi and Aspergillus species. It is the drug of
choice for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (Segal,
2009). Its spectrum of activity extends to the agents of
phaeohyphomycoses  but
t  it  is  not  effective against
zygomycetes. Because of the risk of teratogenicity, azole
drugs are contraindicated in pregnant animals.

Resistance to azole antifungal drugs is a gradual process
which  involves several alterations  in fungal  strains
subjected to antifungal drug pressure. In many of the
isolates studied, multiple mechanisms of resistance were
evident.
Echinocandins
This  group of semisynthetic lipopeptides  inhibit  the
synthesis of 1,3-β-glucan,a major component of many
fungal cell walls. By acting as non-competitive inhibitors
of 1,3-β-glucan synthase, echinocandins interfere with
fungal cell division and also with cell growth. Because
mammalian  cells do  not  contain 
1,3-β-glucan,
1315
echinocandins are selectively toxic for fungi in which
glucans constitute the dominant cell wall component. A
non -  echinocandin lipopeptide which  inhibits  glucan
synthase has shown good activity against yeasts and
Aspergillus species in vitro and in vivo. Fungi such as
Cryptococcus neoformans, which contain predominantly
1,6-β-glucans in their cell walls, are resistant to
echinocandins.   Three  echinocandins,
caspofungin,
micafungin and anidulafungin, appear to have similar
antifungal spectra.
Caspofungin, which has a limited spectrum of activity, is
effective against Candida species, most Aspergillus
species, Pneumocystis carinii and some fungi which cause
phaeohyphomycoses. Its efficacy against dimorphic fungi
is not predictable and it is not effective against C.
neoformans or the zygomycetes.
Primary resistance
 to echinocandins
 among clinical
isolates of Candida species and Aspergillus species
appears to be uncommon. Because of their selective
toxicity for fungal cell walls, few adverse reactions to
echinocandins have been reported in  the human
population. Data  relating
toclinicaltrialswith
echinocandins in animals are limited but it is likely that
these novel antifungal drugs  will be  of  particular
therapeutic value for treating aspergillosis and candidiasis
 in avian and mammalian species.
Flucytosine
This fluorinated pyrimidine is transported into susceptible
fungal cells by the action of cytosine permease and there
1316
converted by the action of fungal cytosine deaminase to
5-fluorouracil.  Later,  5-fluorouracil  is  converted  to
5-fluorouridylic acid which then competes with uracil in
the synthesis of RNA. This results in RNA miscoding and
inhibition of DNA and protein synthesis.
Flucytosine has a narrow spectrum of activity which
includes Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans and a
limited  number  of  dematiaceous  moulds.  Because
resistance to  flucytosine  can develop quickly during
treatment, this drug is used in combination with
amphotericin B or fluconazole. Combination therapy is
used for the treatment of cryptococcosis, especially in cats.
Primary and acquired resistance to flucytosine may result
from absence, dysfunction or deletion of one or more
enzymes which are not essential for fungal survival.
Iodides
Although sodium iodide and potassium iodide have been
used for treating fungal infections for many years, their
modes of action are not well umderstood. Enhancement of
suggested as one antifungal mechanism. An alternative
mode of action may relate to direct interference with
fungal cell metabolism.
A high percentage of human patients with sporotrichosis
recovered  following  oral  administration  of  potassium
iodide and relapses were rare (Arenas, 2005). Sodium
iodide has been used successfully to treat cutaneous and
lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis in animals. Prolonged
1317
treatment with iodine compounds is often required and
may lead to a risk of iodism. To avoid residues in milk and
meat, iodine compounds should be used carefully in
food-producing animals.
Morpholines
Amorolfine, a morpholine derivative with antifungal
activity, is used topically to treat dermatophytosis and
onychomycosis.  This  antifungal
1 compound  inhibits
ergosterol synthesis which is essential for the functioning
of the fungal cell membrane. Other effects include
squalene accumulation and disturbance of chitin synthesis.
Amorolfine has a broad antifungal spectrum which
includes dermatophytes, dimorphic fungi and other fungal
pathogens associated with onychomycosis. It is inactive
against Aspergillus
species. Although considered to be a highly effective
antifungal agent for treating onychomycosis in humans,
this compound's therapeutic activity in animals is not yet
well defined.
Nucleoside-peptides
Chitin   synthesis
is inhibited  by a  number  of
nucleoside-peptides
 including
nikkomycin  Z.  This
antifungal compound inhibits chitin synthase, thereby
interfering with fungal cell wall synthesis. It is reported to
potentiate the effect of flucytosine, some azole compounds
and echinocandins. Nikkomycin  Z has been highly
effective in clinical trials for the treatment of murine
pulmonary  blastomycosis,  histoplasmosis
and
coccidioidomycosis. Further clinical  trials in naturally
1318
infected animals are required to confirm its therapeutic
effectiveness against dimorphic fungal infections
Polyenes
The polyenes are macrolide antibiotics which have a broad
spectrum of activity against fungal pathogens. Many of
these compounds are too toxic for therapeutic use but
amphotericin  B is  suitable for antifungal therapy  in
humans and animals. In common with other polyenes,
amphotericin B binds preferentially to sterols, especially
ergosterol in  the fungal cell membrane. Although
amphotericin  B  binds to cholesterol,  the principal
membrane sterol of mammalian cells, it does so less avidly
than to ergosterol. Binding of this antifungal drug to the
fungal cell membrane alters its permeability resulting in
leakage of sodium, potassium and hydrogen ions and cell
death.Amphotericin B also disrupts the function of
oxidative enzymes in target cells. The spectrum of activity
of this antifungal drug includes pathogenic yeasts,
dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus species and zygomycetes.
Intravenous administration of amphotericin B can result in
nephrotoxicity. The toxic effect is related to the binding of
the drug to the sterol-rich cell membranes in kidney
tubules. Because  of the problems associated  with
conventional amphotericin B use, new formulations with
reduced toxicity and improved pharmacological properties
have been developed. Three new formulations of the drug.
namely a lipid complex of amphotericin B, liposomal
amphotericin B and a colloid suspension of the drug, are
available. These new formulations offer greater efficacy
than conventional amphotericin B with reduced toxicity.
1319
Their high cost, however, has limited their selection for the
treatment of systemic fungal disease in animals.
Development of secondary resistance to amphotericin B
has not emerged as a major problem. Some isolates of
Candida   species   may   be   relatively  resistant   to
amphotericin B and resistance among Aspergillus species
maybe encountered occasionally
Pradimicin antibiotics
Among    the    pradimicin
 antibiotics,   pradimicin
BMS-181184 has antifungal activity. This water-soluble
pradimicin derivative binds to cell surface carbohydrate
components of yeast cells. Changes induced by this
antifungal  compound include potassium  leakage  from
yeast cells. Because it does not have affinity for cultured
animal cells, this pradimicin derivative appears to have
selective  antifungal
1activity. Pradimicin A,  a low
molecular   weight  carbohydrate-binding   agent   with
antifungal activity, also has selective inhibitory activity
against human immunodeficiency virus (Balzarini et al.,
2007).
Sordarins and azasordarins
This new class of antifungal drugs selectively inhibits
fungal  growth by blocking elongation factor  2 and
disrupting protein synthesis. Sordarin derivatives have a
broad antifungal spectrum which includes dermatophytes,
Aspergillus species, dimorphic fungi and Pneumocystis
carinii. When combined with amphotericin B, sordarins
have a synergistic action against Candida species and
1320
Aspergillus species. In clinical trials using animal models,
sordarinswereeffective
against histoplasmosis.
coccidioidomycosis  and  pneumocystosis. Toxicological
data suggest that sordarins are relatively safe drugs but
more extensive clinical trials are required to confirm their
  e      
Ciclopirox olamine
This antifungal drug, a substituted pyridone, has a broad
antifungal spectrum. Ciclopirox olamine alters membrane
transport, cell membrane integrity and mitochondrial
electron transport processes. In addition to its antifungal
activity against dermatophytes and yeasts, including
Malassezia species, it is active against some Gram-positive
and
 some Gram-negative
bacteria.  Italso has
anti-inflammatory activity which may be beneficial in the
treatment of some superficial fungal infections. This drug,
which is used topically, penetrates through the epidermis
into the dermis. It is especially effective for the treatment
of onychomycosis in humans but long-term treatment is
required to eliminate the fungal infection. Toxicity has not
been reported when ciclopirox olamine is used topically.
Classification of antifungal drugs and their modes of
action are presented in Table 53.2. The modes and

Resistance to antifungal drugs
A recognized feature of many infectious agents is that they
are either inherently resistant or become resistant to drugs
that interfere with their replication or otherwise alter their
metabolism. Fungal pathogens conform to this biological
pattern of either possessing resistance to antifungal drugs
or acquiring
resistance

secondary resistance may develop. Mutation and selection
1322
account for much of the secondary resistance that
develops. A commonly observed type of secondary
resistance is the replacement of a particular fungal
pathogen with a more resistant strain or, in some instances,
with a more resistant species. Alternatively, a single strain
may include a resistant subpopulation which may be
selected for by sustained antifungal therapy. Other changes
in fungal cells which may lead to decreased susceptibility
to antifungal drugs include transient gene expression
resulting from antifungal therapy, and possession and
expression of particular virulence factors. Much of the
acquired resistance to antifungal drugs in the human
population has been attributed to prophylactic therapy or to
suboptimal dosage associated with prolonged treatment.
In contrast to the rapid emergence and spread of high-level
multidrug resistance encountered with bacteria, antifungal
resistance usually develops slowly and involves the
emergence of resistant species or a gradual change in the
cellular structures or functions which result in resistance to
the antifungal drug. Unlike the resistance mechanisms
observedforsome
antibacterial agents, there is no evidence at present that
fungal pathogens are capable of breaking down or
structurally modifying antifungal agents as a means of
achieving resistance. Primary and acquired resistance to
flucytosine is attributed to an absence, dysfunction or
deletion of one or more enzymes which are not essential
for fungal survival.  Mechanisms of resistance  to
fluconazole include decreased binding activity to the P450
cytochrome, increased production of the target cytochrome
and decreased accumulation of the drug in fungal cells due
to reduced uptake or increased efflux mechanisms
1323
Resistance to amphotericin B is reported infrequently.
Quantitative or qualitative change in the sterol content of

include a decrease in the amount of ergosterol in the cell
due to inhibition of synthesis, replacement of ergosterol
with episterol or other sterols and alterations in the ratio of
sterols to phospholipids (Arikan and Rex, 2005).
Resistance related to qualitative change may include
reorientation or masking of ergosterol in the fungal cell
membrane. It has been reported that previous exposure to
azole compounds, which lead to depletion of ergosterol.
may contribute to amphotericin B resistance in fungal
cells.
Resistance to azole drugs may arise from qualitative or

14-α-demethylase, decreased access of the drug to the

Quantitative modifications may arise from increased copy
numbers of the enzyme leading to increased synthesis of
ergosterol. Azole resistance may occur due to changes in
sterol or  phospholipid  composition  in  the  fungal  cell
membrane resulting in decreased permeability to the
antifungal drugs. In addition to decreased accumulation of
the antifungal drug in the target cells, increased efflux
mechanisms may contribute to azole resistance. Efflux
pump systems have been implicated in fluconazole and
itraconazole   resistance  in  Candida  species  and

the immune status of the host, the site and severity of the

usuallygradual and

When necessary, combination  therapy which achieves
synergy with the antifungal drugs selected should be
employed. A better understanding of the virulence factors
of pathogenic fungi would allow the formulation of
treatment regimes appropriate for the tissue or system
invaded. Consideration of host factors should form part of
the treatment strategy, as measures aimed at enhancing the
host' s immune response to the invading pathogen may
contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of antifungal drugs.

Nature, structure and taxonomy of viruses
The term ‘virus’ (Latin, poison) refers to members of a
unique class of infectious agents which are extremely
small, contain only one type of nucleic acid and have an
absolute dependence on living cells for replication (Box
54.1). Viruses have some of the characteristics of living
cells, such as a genome and the ability to adapt. Unlike
living cells, however, they lack autonomy as they cannot
capture and store free energy. Because of these limitations
viruses are generally viewed as sub-cellular, non-living,
infectious entities which only become part of a living
borrowed life (van Regenmortel, 2000). The genomes of
the viruses that infect animals are considerably smaller
than those of prokaryotic cells, ranging from about 2
kilobase pairs (kbp) to 8o0 kbp. In the majority of virus
families, the nucleic acid is present as a single molecule;
however, in some RNA virus families (e.g. Reoviridae and
Orthomyxoviridae), the nucleic acid occurs in separate
segments. Although the nucleic acid of viral genomes is
usually linear, it is circular in some viruses such as
parvoviruses. Genomes of both DNA and RNA viruses can
De
 single-stranded    or    double-stranded.  Particular
characteristics of DNA and RNA viruses are presented in
Tables 54.1 and 54.2 and in Figs 54.1 and 54.2.
Recently, an icosahedral DNA virus named Sputnik has
been found in association with the large mimivirus,
Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV). Sputnik
1330
has been shown to multiply in the virus factory found in
amoebae co-infected with  APMV. The activities of
Sputnik are deleterious to APMV and the term virophage
et al., 2008). Two unique types of infectious agents, which
are structurally less complex than viruses, are recognized.
viroids and prions. Viroids are composed of naked RNA
and prions are proteinaceous infectious particles which are
devoid of demonstrable nucleic acid
In recent years, remarkable advances have been made in
our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and
control of viral diseases. However, as new viral diseases
are recognized in the animal and human populations, fresh
challenges confront those engaged in virological research.
The origin of viruses
Viruses have evolved to a stage where they are considered
to be among the most efficient and economic forms of
microbial life. They can be categorized in three main
groups on the basis of their nucleic acid composition:
DNA viruses, RNA viruses and viruses that utilize both
DNA and RNA for replication. Differences between these
groups are significant and may be indicative of
independent origins for each group. Although the origin of
viruses is uncertain, and no fossil remains exist, four
theories have been proposed to explain their evolution.
They may have originated from primitive, pre-cellular
RNA replicons, which evolved to become dependent on
cells for replication. Alternatively, they may have arisen
from segments of cellular nucleic acid which acquired the
ability to replicate at the expense of the host cell. The third
1331
theory, the regressive theory of the origin of viruses,
postulates that they arose from free-living organisms,
which gradually lost genetic information until they became
totally dependent on the biosynthetic pathways of their
host cells. The study of the genomes of viruses and their
host organisms supports the view that viruses are probably
as ancient as cells and have co-evolved with them. Whole
genomic sequencing studies indicate that all life forms and
sub-cellular replicons share basic structural and functional
motifs. In fact, viruses have mediated lateral gene transfers
among cells and in this way have contributed to cellular
change.

Structure of viruses
A fully assembled infective virus is termed a virion. This
term is not synonymous with the term virus. A virion can
be considered solely in terms of its physical constituents or
chemical composition. In contrast, a virus possesses not
[     s     
characteristics which become evident when it infects a
susceptible host cell. The definition of a virus must,
therefore, include the various functional activities and
biotic interactions that make it a biological entity (van
Regenmortel, 2000).
The  fundamental
component of the virionisa
nucleoprotein core with the ability to infect host cells and
replicate in them, thus ensuring continued survival. The
genome of vertebrate viruses is enclosed within a shell of
proteins called a capsid (Fig. 54.3). It is haploid except in
retroviruses, in which it is diploid. The term nucleocapsid
is used to describe the packaged form of the genome in the
capsid. Each subunit of the capsid is composed of a folded
polypeptide chain. Collections of these subunits constitute
structural units or protomers which in turn  comprise
assembly units. The term capsomer or morphological unit
is used to describe features such as protrusions seen on the
surface of virus particles in electron micrographs. These
often correspond to groups of protein subunits arranged
about a local axis of symmetry. Capsids are therefore
composed of multiples of one or more types of protein
subunits.  The  orderly

structure. Icosahedral and helical symmetries are the two
types of capsid symmetry described in viruses (Fig. 54.4)

Closed-shell virions, isometric viruses, have structures
based on icosahedral symmetry, a structural form which
offers the maximum capacity and greatest strength for a
given surface area. The icosahedron, one of the five
platonic solids, has 20 equilateral triangles forming its
faces, 30 edges and 12 vertices. At its simplest, a viral
icosahedron has 60 identical structural units, three in each
triangular face. Larger numbers of smaller units are
accommodated on the triangular faces only in specific
multiples of 60, represented by the formula T = h^ + hk +
k2 where h and k are integers having no common factors
and T is the triangulation number. For caliciviruses, T = 3
and for herpesviruses, T = 16. The structural units at each
vertex form groups of five termed pentons, while those on
the faces form groups of six called hexons. There are
two-fold, three-fold and five-fold axes of rotational
symmetry which pass through edges, faces and vertices,
respectively. Viruses with icosahedral symmetry are often
not seen as icosahedrons; they may appear in electron
micrographs as spheres or hexagons. Icosahedral capsids
are generally assembled in the host cell prior to
incorporation of the viral nucleic acid. Some viral
preparations may contain capsids devoid of nucleic acid.
The nucleic acid of double-stranded DNA viruses is
condensed into a form suitable for incorporation into
capsids by the action of cellular histones and basic
virus-encoded molecules. The protective capsid of many
RNA viruses is formed by the insertion of protein units
between each turm of the nucleic acid helix, incorporating
the RNA in the tubular package. As a result, the capsid
protein helix coincides with that of the nucleic acid; the
length of the helix is determined by the length of the RNA
1338
molecule. In RNA viruses, each capsomere consists of a
single polypeptide molecule.

Taxonomy of viruses
The sole experimental indication of the minute size of
viruses at the end of the nineteenth century was their
ability to pass through filters which retained bacteria.
Information relating to viruses derived largely from studies
on the diseases which they caused. Early classification
systems were therefore based on their pathogenic effects
and transmission patterns. In the 1930s, details of the
structure and composition of viruses began to emerge.
Subsequently, it was possible to group viruses on the basis
of shared features of virions. During the 1950s and 1960s,
several  classification  schemes
were  adopted.The
International Committee on Nomenclature of Viruses
(ICNV) was established in 1966 to develop a single
universal taxonomic scheme. The successor to the ICNV,
the InternationalCommittee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV), established in 1973, developed and expanded the
1341
universal scheme in which virion characteristics are used
to assign viruses to five main hierarchical levels, namely
order, family, subfamily, genus and species (Tables 54.3 to
54.8). Virus orders are designated by the suffix -virales. In
orders, phylogenetically related families are grouped
together. Four orders containing viruses of animals have
been defined thus far. These are the Mononegavirales
comprising the families Paramyxo-viridae, Rhabdoviridae,
Bornaviridaeand
Filoviridae,
thePicornavirales
comprising the families Picornaviridae, If laviridae,
Dicistroviridae,
Marnaviridae
and Secoviridae,  the
HerpesviralescomprisingthefamiliesHerpesviridae,
Alloherpesviridae
2and Malacoherpesviridae, and the
Nidoviralescomprising
the familiesCoronaviridae,
Arteriviridae and Roniviridae. It has been proposed that a
new order, Retrovirales, be created comprising the families
Retroviridae,
Hepadnaviridae,
Caulimoviridae,
Pseudoviridae and Metaviridae. Families are therefore
designated by the suffix-viridae. Of more than 70 families
currently recognized, about 22
containvirusesof
veterinary importance.The suffix -virinae denotes a
subfamily. Viral genera are designated by the suffix -virus.
More than 280 genera are recognized. The criteria for
defining a genus differ from family to family. The species
taxon is regarded as the most important level in the
classification of viruses. However, its definition and
application have always been difficult and controversial. In
1991, the ICTV accepted the definition of a virus species
proposed by van Regenmortel (1990) which states that ^a
virus species is defined as a polythetic class of viruses that
constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular
ecological niche'. This implies that a virus species is
defined by a  combination  of multiple properties and
1342
characteristics; no single or unique property is essential for
species definition. This comprehensive type of taxonomy
is the Adansonian system of classification. In the present
scheme of virus taxonomy, the primary delineating criteria
are the type and nature of the genome, the mode and site of
viral replication and the structure of the virion. Currently,
more than 1,900 virus species are recognized by the ICTV,
with the periodic inclusion of new species. In addition,
     s 
strains and subtypes. These latter categories have become
accepted for practical reasons such as vaccine development
and the diagnosis of disease. Universal definitions or
formal nomenclature for strains and subtypes of virus
species are not recognized internationally.

The ease with which base sequencing can be carried out on
viral nucleic acids has revolutionized approaches to virus
taxonomy and phylogeny. Reference genome sequences
are available for all viral taxa in databases such as
GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank), which
permit
 substantial
shortcuts
to
specific
taxonomic
placements. In addition, the use of statistical methods for
comparing sequence similarities has contributed to studies
on the evolution of viruses. The ICTV intends to reserve
the hierarchical level or order solely for the recognition of
phylogenetic relationships. Recently, interest has focused
         
subspecies level. Particular attention has been given to the
frequency of mutation in a number of RNA viruses
whereby, on average, every progeny virus will differ by
1345
one mutation and, as a consequence of this, a given viral
population will comprise a heterogeneous assortment of
mutants. This phenomenon
has
resultedin the
development of the concept of viral quasispecies (Eigen,
1993). This concept envisages that each virus quasispecies
exists as a genetically diverse, rapidly evolving population
of virions, with non-identical but closely related mutant
and recom-binant viral genomes represented by a complex
mutant spectrum and a consensus (average) nucleotide
sequence. The consensus sequence may not physically
exist in the mutant spectrum. A viral quasispecies may be
dominated by one or several master (dominant) sequences,
which generally have a selective advantage and may or
may not coincide with the consensus sequence. The
population as a whole, the quasispecies, is the unit of
selection and acts as a genetic pool which is subject to a
continuous process of variation, competition and selection.
The population is in dynamic equilibrium, with the
expansive force of mutation balanced by the constraining
force of selection. The survival of the quasispecies
depends on the stability of the consensus sequence, the
complexity of the information in the genome and the
copying fidelity If an advantageous mutant appears, the
original quasispecies will be substituted by a new one,
  p an snss au e q o
distribution of mutants (mutant spectrum). This concept is
particularly important with regard to RNA viruses with
larger   genomes.   Because a cellular  proof-reading
mechanism for RNA is lacking, error rates during
         n
replicating viral DNA. As a result, non-lethal mutations
tend to accumulate in the genome of RNA viruses. It has
been estimated that RNA viruses can evolve up to one
1346
million times faster than DNA viruses. However, high
size due to the ‘error threshold',a critical average error
rate. Above this threshold a virus cannot maintain
sequence integrity. As a result, the genomes of RNA
viruses are restricted to about 30 kilobases or less,
typically 5 to 15 kb. In contrast DNA viral genomes as
large as 800 kb have been described.

Replication of viruses
Unlike bacteria, which can grow on inert media, viruses
are obligate intracellular parasites and can multiply only in
host cells. This requirement arises from their limited
genomic composition which obliges them to utilize various
combinations of host cell transcriptional and translational
machinery, organelles, enzymes and other macromolecules
for replication. The effects of viral multiplication on host
cells range from minor to major changes in cellular
metabolism to transformation, persistent infection and
cytolysis.Studiesof
f viral reproduction are usually
conducted in synchronously-infected cell cultures. In these
cultures, cells are infected with an excess of virus particles
to ensure that a single synchronous cycle of virus
replication takes place. The duration of the cycle may
range from 6 to 40 hours. Within hours of infection, an
    s  s  
methods such as virus assay or electron microscopy. After
this eclipse phase, virions are demonstrable both
intracellularly and extracellularly. The number of viral
particles increases exponentially.Fullyassembledvirions
are released from infected cells either by budding or by
cytolysis. The number of virions released is largely
dependent on the species of infecting virus and on the host
cells and may approach many thousands.
The replicative cycle of a virus can be conveniently
divided into a number of stages: attachment and entry into
the cell, uncoating of viral nucleic acid, synthesis of
1351
virus-specific proteins, production of new viral nucleic
acid and assembly and release of newly formed viruses
from the host cell (Box 55.1). A virion must first attach to
cell surface receptors in order to produce infection. Initial
virus-cell interaction is a randomevent, which relates to
the number of virus particles present and the availability of
appropriate receptor molecules. Virus-cell  interaction
determines both the host range and the tissue tropism of
viral species. Different viruses have evolved to the point
where they can utilize a wide range of host cell surface
proteins as receptors. Certain groups of surface molecules
appear
to
be
preferred
receptors 
including
as
proteoglycans, glycoconjugates with terminal sialic acid
residues, integrins 
and
the
IgG
superfamily of
transmembrane proteins. Many of these surface molecules
are highly conserved and are essential for fundamental
cellular functions. Some viruses have more than one type
of ligand molecule and they may bind to several cell
surface receptors in sequential order during attachment.
Several viruses undergo an initial, non-specific binding,
which helps to concentrate virions at a cell surface, prior to
binding to more specific receptors. Adenoviruses bind to a
primary receptor via a knob-like protein structure on the
end of the projecting fibres at the vertices of the capsid. As
a result, the fibre becomes distorted, bringing the virus
closer to the cell membrane and permitting the engagement
of a second receptor, an integrin, at a site on the penton
base. In the case of some species of virus, individual
virions can detach and adsorb to another cell when
infection of a particular host cell does not proceed. For
orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses, detachment of
virus   is    mediated
by
viral
neuraminidase, a
receptor-destroying enzyme.

Virus uptake or penetration is an energy-dependent process
which can occur in a number of ways. Receptor-mediated
endocytosis is a mechanism which is frequently used for
cell entry by non-enveloped viruses. The most common
endocytic
pathway
15
1
the clathrin-mediated endocytic
pathway, which is normally used by cells to internalize
receptor-bound
  ligands,
fluid,
lipids and  membrane
proteins. This pathway involves pre-existing or induced
clathrin-coated pits, which invaginate into the cell and are
pinched off, forming endocytotic vesicles which contain
the virus-receptor complex. The cage-like lattice formed
around the vesicles by clathrin molecules breaks down
soon after endocytosis and the vesicle becomes competent
to
fuse with
an
early
endo-some. The increasing
acidification of
the
eendosome as it becomes a late
endosome frequently leads to conformational change in the
virus and helps to facilitate penetration into the cytosol.
The
envelopes
of
several
vruses, 
such
as
orthomyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses and flaviviruses, fuse
with
the  membranes 
of
endosomes,
releasing
nucleocapsids directly
yinto the cytoplasm. Eventual
degradation of viral structures remaining in the late
1353
endosome occurs following fusion with a lyso-some. In
rare instances, lysosomes may play a part in penetration.
Alternative, endocytic pathways utilized by viruses include
caveolae-mediated
and
 raft-mediated
pathways.
.A
particular virus may use different endocytic pathways
depending on cell type, virus multiplicity and conditions of
growth. An alternative strategy, which may be used by
enveloped viruses including paramyxoviruses, retroviruses
and herpes-viruses, involves direct fusion of the viral
envelope with the plasma membrane. This allows release
of the nucleocapsid directly into the host cell cytoplasm.
Mechanisms  employed by  non-enveloped
[viruses to
penetrate into the cytosol through the cell membrane or
through the limiting membrane of an organelle such as an
endosome or a caveosome are incompletely understood but
include: (a)
puncture,which
involves the direct
introduction or translocation of the viral genome into the
cytoplasm through channels or pores generated by the
virus (picormaviruses) in the plasma membrane; (b)
perforation, which involves transfer of the intact virus
without lysis of the membrane (parvo-viruses); (c) lysis,
such as occurs when adenoviruses are released from
endosomes by acid-activated rupture of the limiting
membrane.
Uncoating is the process whereby the viral genome is
released in a form suitable for transcription and may
involve partial or full disassembly. In the case of
enveloped viruses, in which the nucleocapsid is discharged
directly into the cytoplasm, transcription can usually
proceed without complete uncoating. In non-enveloped
viruses, uncoating is poorly understood but generally
involves conformational changes, proteolytic enzyme
1354
activity, progressive loss of structural proteins and
weakening of intermolecular interactions. In reoviruses,
the genome may express all functions without complete
release from the capsid. The uncoating of most other
non-enveloped viruses proceeds to completion. Poxviruses
host enzymes, with complete release of viral DNA from
the core requiring virus-specified proteins. In some viruses
which replicate in the cell nucleus, uncoating may be
that replicate in the nucleus, entry into the nucleoplasm
may occur via the NPC, or alternatively the virus may wait
until the nuclear membrane breaks down during cell
division. The main limitation to transport via the NPC is
size, with a functional pore diameter of 39 nm. As a result,
only the smallest viruses such as parvoviruses can be
transported intact, while in the case of larger viruses, a
subviral complex or nucleic acid is transported into the
nucleus.
The synthesis of viral proteins by host cells, which is the
central event in replication of viruses, requires the
production of viral mRNA. Those DNA viruses, the
majority of which replicate in the nucleus, can avail of host
cell transcriptases to synthesize viral mRNA. Other viruses
utilize theirown
1enzymes to generate mRNA.A
significant proportion of the genome of RNA viruses is
devoted to encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
(RdRp), because these enzymes are not available in host
cells. The polymerase enzymes function both as a
transcriptase to produce viral mRNA and as a replicase to
produce progeny viral RNA. Many viruses have evolved
strategies which facilitate interference with the activity of
1355
cellular mRNA. Viruses direct the synthesis of either a
separate mRNA for each gene or a polycistronic mRNA
encompassing
a number
of
 genes.
Eukaryotic cell
protein-synthesizing mechanisms, however, translate only
monocistronic messages.
If：
a
1 large precursor protein
molecule is produced, cleavage into individual proteins is
required and each family of viruses employs unique
strategies for this purpose.

At a molecular level, the diversity of viral genome
structures and replication strategies is marked. However,
all viruses must express mRNA during the early stages of
infection, so that the translational machinery of the cell can
be harnessed to make viral proteins. Based on the nature of
the genome and the pathways of mRNA synthesis, viruses
1356
of veterinary importance can be grouped into six classes
(Baltimore, 1971). A seventh class has since been added as
a result of the discovery of hepadnaviruses which are
reverse-transcribing double-stranded DNA viruses. Central
to this scheme is the designation of the genome of
single-stranded   RNA
virusesaspositive-senseor
negative-sense nucleic acid (Fig. 55.1). In this context, the
word ‘sense’ refers to the translated nucleic acid. The
nucleic acid of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses
is mRNA in sense and can be translated directly into virus
protein.
In this chapter, specific viruses have been selected to
illustrate the replicative mechanisms of both DNA and
RNA viruses. However, individual viruses within these
two groups frequently exhibit unique replicative methods.
Although they have many similarities, the mechanisms
involved in the replication of DNA and RNA viruses are
complex intracellular events, which require separate
consideration.
Replication of DNA viruses
Double-stranded DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses,
papillomaviruses and adenoviruses, which replicate in the
nucleus of the cell, have a relatively direct replication
strategy  as  the  starting  material
(dsDNA) can be

Replication of the DNA genomes of poxviruses and

enzymes which enable them to replicate in the cytoplasm

A defined temporal sequence of events occurs during
replication and transcription of DNA viruses. Specified
genes
encode
for
early
proteins,which
include the
enzymes and other proteins necessary for virus replication
and, in some instances, for suppression of the synthesis of
host cell
 proteins.
Subsequently, replication of viral
nucleic acid and transcription of the genes which encode
the late proteins occur. These late proteins (so called
because they are translated following replication of viral
DNA), which are also frequently transcribed from newly
1359
formed viral nucleic acid, are structural components
synthesized late in the infection cycle. This temporal
sequence is not clearly demonstrable in the replicative
cycles of RNA viruses in which most of the genetic
information is expressed contemporaneously. This early/
late switch of genes in DNA viruses is considered to be an
evolutionary adaptation to competition with the host cell
for gene expression. As a result, early gene expression is
modest whereas, incontrast, late gene expression occurs
following genome replication when the increased gene
copy numbers facilitate viral dominance of protein
synthesis mechanisms within the host cell. Intermediate
gene sets have been identified in poxviruses and
herpesviruses.
Replication of RNA viruses
Most RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm. However,
retroviruses, orthomyxoviruses and bormaviruses replicate
in the nuclei of host cells. Reoviruses, orthomyxo-viruses
and birnaviruses, double-stranded RNA viruses, have
segmented genomes. Transcription
occurs in the cytoplasm under the direction of a viral
transcriptase. The negative-sense strand of each segment 1s
transcribed to produce individual mRNA molecules. In
contrast, the genomes of positive-sense, single-stranded
RNA viruses can act directly as mRNA following infection
(Fig. 55.3). The enzymes necessary for genome replication
in these viruses are produced after infection by direct
translation of virion RNA.Taking picornaviruses as an
example, this RNA can bind directly to ribosomes and is
translated to yield a single polyprotein, which is then
cleaved to yield both functional and structural proteins.
1360
Because direct translation can occur, naked RNA extracted
from positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses is
infectious. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
viruses utilize a number of different synthetic pathways
during replication. In togaviruses, only about two-thirds of
the viral RNA is directly translated during the first round

Subsequently，f
full-length
negative-sense RNA is synthesized, and from this a

and a one-third-length positive-sense RNA strand are
formed. The genomes of caliciviruses, coronaviruses and
arteriviruses also encode for mRNA which can be full
length or shorter (referred to as subgenomic)

The genome of retroviruses consists of positive-sense,
single-stranded
1RNA 
which
does
not  function
as
messenger RNA. Instead, a single-stranded DNA copy is
produced by RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse
transcriptase), using the viral RNA as a template. As the
second strand of DNA is formed, the parental RNA is
removed
1 from the RNA-DNA hybrid molecule. The
reverse
 transcriptase molecule mediates two activities,
DNA
polymerase
activity
which
incorporates
deoxyribonucleotides on either a DNA or an RNA
template, and RNase H activity which degrades RNA
when it is present in a DNA/RNA duplex form. The
resulting double-stranded DNA appears to enter the cell
1365
nucleus by one of two mechanisms: following breakdown
of the nuclear membrane during mitosis, or through active
    n   
membrane. This may partly explain the requirement of
some retroviruses for dividing cells, whereas lentiviruses
can successfully infect non-dividing cells. The viral DNA
is integrated into the host cell genome as a provirus
through the action of DNA integrase (Fig. 55.5). Both
enzymes, reverse transcriptase and integrase, are carried
into the host cell inside the virion core. The integrated
DNA provirus, which may be incorporated into cellular
chromosomes at a number of sites, can be transcribed to
new viral RNA.

Membrane proteins and glycoproteins are synthesized on

including enzymes are synthesized on ribosomes free in

known as sorting sequences, facilitate the incorporation of
proteins at various cellular locations where they are
required  for  metabolic  activity.  Most  viral proteins
undergo post-translational
modification
including
proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation and glycosylation.
During glycosylation,
sugar side-chains are added to viral proteins in a
programmed manner as the proteins are being transferred
from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi
apparatus preparatory to final assembly of intact virions
and their release from the cell.
1366
Assembly and release of virions
The mechanisms for the assembly and release off
enveloped
1   and  non-enveloped
I viruses  are   distinct.
Non-enveloped viruses of animals have an icosahedral
structure. The structural proteins of these viruses associate
spontaneously in a symmetrical and stepwise fashion to
form procapsids. Subsequently, viral nucleic acid is
incorporated into the procapsid. Proteolytic cleavage of
specific procapsid polypeptides may be required for the
final  formation  of  infectious particles.  Non-enveloped
viruses   are
usually
 released
following  cellular
disintegration (lysis). The assembly of picor-naviruses and
reoviruses occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell whereas
parvoviruses, adenoviruses and
1   papillomaviruses 
are
assembled in the nucleus.
In enveloped viruses, the final step in the process of virion
assembly involves acquisition of an envelope by budding
from cell membranes. Prior to budding, cell membranes
are
 modified
by
the
 insertion
of virus-specified
transmembrane glycoproteins which aggregate in patches
in the plasma
  membrane.
The
presenceofviral
glycoproteins alters the antigenic composition of infected
cells, which subsequently can become targets for cytotoxic
T lymphocytes. Togavirus nucleo-capsids bind to the
hydrophilic domains
 of the virus-specified membrane
proteins which project slightly into the cytoplasm and
become surrounded by the altered portion of membrane.
The nucleocapsids  of helical   viruses  bind  to  a
virus-specified matrix protein which lines the cytoplasmic
side of membrane patches
1367
Budding of viruses through the plasma membrane does not
usually breach the integrity of the membrane and, as a
result, many enveloped viruses are non-cytopathic and
may be associated with persistent infections. Assembly of
retrovirus virions occurs by two main pathways: for
retroviruses with C-type morphology, capsid assembly and
envelopment occurs concurrently at the plasma membrane;
in the case of capsid assembly of retroviruses with B-type
and D-type morphology, it occurs at an intracytoplasmic.

the plasma membrane and budding. Non-cytopathic
viruses need to avoid rebinding to receptors on the host

promote destruction of terminal sialic acid residues on the
cellular receptors used for viral attachment on the host cell
surface. In the case of influenza virus, the neuraminidase is
critical for virus release as it prevents nascent virions from
attaching to the host cell surface receptors and to each
other. Retroviruses produce an over-abundance of viral
glycoproteins such that cellular receptors are bound by
their ligand as they are transported to the cell surface
resulting in removal or down-regulation of the receptor

Flaviviruses, coronaviruses, arteriviruses and bunyaviruses
acquire their envelopes inside cells by budding through the
membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum or the

plasma membrane, releasing the virion by exocytosis

still some uncertainty over the precise mechanism of
egress, and three alternative methods have been proposed:
single nuclear envelopment, dual envelopment and single
cytoplasmic envelopment. It is possible that different
pathways are used at different times during the cycle of
infection.

Genetics and evolution of viruses
Viruses exhibit enormous genetic diversity. These minute
pathogens are capable of infecting not only vertebrates but
also invertebrates, plants, fungi, 1
protozoa, algae and
bacteria. Viruses utilize a variety of molecular mechanisms
to compensate for their limited genetic capability. They
may encode genes in different reading frames. These
reading frames may overlap, may be encoded in opposite
directions or may be read by frameshifting. Some viruses
maximize their limited genome size by using subgenomic
RNA fractions, where a portion of the RNA is translated
into viral proteins. In recent years, the development of
techniques in molecular and cell biology, including
molecular cloning, nucleotide 
sequencing
and the
polymerase  chain
reaction, have greatly
expanded
knowledge of viral genomes. Viral genetics is concerned
not only with understanding the detailed structure of the
viral genome and the extent to which it determines the
biological and disease-producing potential of viruses, but
also with elucidation of the mechanisms of genetic change
and virus evolution. Genomic change is responsible for
alterations in antigenicity and pathogenicity which, in turn,
may influ-ence the course of viral diseases of animals and
humans. Mutation is the most frequent cause of genetic
change in viruses. Less commonly, genetic interactions
termed recombinations, which can occur between different
viruses or between a virus and its host cell, may account
for alteration in virus characteristics. This genetic variation
has no specific or pre-established purpose and serves to
1371
generate repertoires of variant genomes subject to
evolutionary selection forces. Virus evolution follows
general Darwinian principles.
Mutation
Spontaneous and random errors in the copying of viral
nucleic acid, termed mutations, can occur during the
replication of viruses. The rate of mutation in the genome
of DNA viruses ranges from10-
to10
11
per
incorporated nucleotide, whereas the mutation rate in the
genomes of RNA viruses is much higher, ranging from
10-3. to 10-5. When replicating in the nucleus of host
cells, the genomes of DNA viruses are subjected to error
correction carried out by cellular exonucleases. Some viral
DNA polymerases

activity. The lower fidelity of genome replication in RNA

has implications  for
genome size. DNA virus genomes are rather stable and can
be very large, up to 800 kb. In contrast, the genome size of
RNA viruses is typically less than 20 kb because high error

catastrophe'. Coronaviruses are exceptional in having a
genome of between 27 and 32 kb. RNA virus quasispecies
have a mis-incorporation rate per nucleotide per replication
of about 1/u where v is the length in bases of the genome
As a result, these viruses tend to be near or at their error
threshold.
1372
Exposure to X-rays, UV irradiation or chemical mutagens
increases the frequency of mutation. Point
mutations, resulting from single nucleotide substitutions,
are the most common type of mutation. Less common
types of mutation result from the deletion or insertion of
one or more nucleotides. Additive effects of point
mutations, occurring
account for phenotypic variations which are influenced by
selection processes. Because they frequently do not result
in alteration of the amino acid composition of the coded
protein, most point mutations are thus silent. In other
instances, the mutation may be lethal and virus strains
containing such lethal mutations are rapidly eliminated.
Occasionally, mutations conferring a selective advantage
allow positive selection of the mutant virus. Non-lethal
mutations may accumulate rapidly in the genomes of RNA
viruses giving rise to quasispecies, genetically diverse
populations  of   viruses

sequences. As a result, RNA viruses have enormous
       
can be rapidly generated. The spectrum of viruses
following mutation does not behave as a collection of
independent genomes, but rather as a unit of selection.
Different components of the mutant spectrum can interact
in both a positive (complementation effect) and a negative
(suppressive or interfering effect) manner. A new area of
antiviral research, termed lethal mutagenesis, exploits the
inherently high mutation rates of RNA viruses and
involves the administration of mutagenic agents to drive
viral extinction through volation of the error threshold and
error catastrophe. Viral suppression is facilitated by a low
viral load and low viral fitness. The most promising results
1373
have been obtained using a combination of mutagenic
agents and antiviral compounds.
Phenotypic expression of a mutation may be reversed by a
back-mutation at the nucleotide responsible for the original
mutation. Alternatively, a suppressor mutation may
prevent phenotypic expression of the mutant gene. The
phenotypic expression of a particular mutation may give
risetoclearly
distinguishable
mutants
 including
conditional-lethal,
antibody-escape
and
defective-interfering mutants.
Conditional-lethal mutants
 can replicate only under
defined permissive conditions. Examples of such mutants
include temperature-sensitive mutants, which can multiply
most efficiently at temperature ranges different from
parental wild-type viruses, and host-range mutants, which
can infect host species different from those of parent
viruses.  The  temperature-sensitive
mutants，which
replicate at temperatures slightly below core mammalian
body temperature, have been particularly useful in the
development of live intranasal vaccines. Such vaccines
stimulate local immunity without systemic spread. When
first isolated, viruses may grow poorly in cell cultures and
in laboratory animals. However, adaptation can usually be
achieved by serial passage, resulting in selection of rapidly
growing mutants. This selection process is dependent on
surface proteins which determine binding efficiency to
host cell receptors. Host-range mutants, while often
replicating more readily in vitro, tend to be less virulent for
natural host species. This has been exploited as a method
1374
for attenuation in the production of many modified live
vaccines.
Selection for antibody escape mutants can occur when
viruses replicate in the presence of antibody. Because of
altered antigenic surface determinants, the mutants are
unaffected by  neutralizing antibodies induced by the
wild-type virus. Such a selection process may facilitate
persistent or recurring infections.
In 1954, von Magnus noted that serial undiluted passage of
influenza  virus resulted in a significant decrease in
infectious titre, despite the number of viral particles
remaining constant. This phenomenon is due to the
accumulation of defective interfering viral particles in viral
stocks. Defective-interfering mutants require the presence
of a complementing, helper virus, usually the wild-type
virus, for replication. Most defective-interfering viral
particles are deletion mutants and display a replication
advantage relative to wild-type virus. Such mutants can
interfere with the replication of wild-type helper viruses,
presumably by competing more effectively for host cell
resources, and may, therefore, become progressively more
numerous on serial passage. Defective-interfering mutants
may play a role in disease, by promoting the establishment
and maintenance of persistent infections.
Viral recombination
The exchange or transfer of genetic material between
different but closely related viruses infecting the same cell
is termed genetic recombination. This type of genetic
exchange can also occur between virus and host cells. The
1375
genomes of  the recombinants contain new genetic
information. The alteration of genetic information may
result from intramolecular recombination, copy-choice
recombination, reassortment or genetic reactivation.
Intramolecular recombination usually occurs in DNA
viruses and involves dissociation and reestablishment of
covalent bonds within the nucleic acid in a process similar
tothat observed in bacteria and higher organisms.
Copy-choice (template switching) recombination between
positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses occurs through
a template switching mechanism. The RNA polymerase
switches between template strands during synthesis of the
complementary negative-sense strand. This process can
S     
has been observed in mixed infections of coronaviruses. It
is suggested that western equine encephalitis virus arose
through copy-choice recombination as a heterologous
recombinant of the two toga-viruses, easterm equine
encephalitis virus and a Sindbis-like virus. High-frequency
recombination in retroviruses occurring, on average, more
than once per replication event per genome, is a
consequence of the retrovirus genome and replication
strategy. Although the retrovirus genome is diploid, only a
single provirus is generated. The two copies of the RNA
genome are typically involved in the process of reverse
transcription. Normally the two RNA molecules in a virion
are identical but they may be distinct if derived from two
viruses or viral strains resulting in a high frequency of
recombination
 in   the 
eresulting
proviralDNA.
Recombination has played an important role in the
variability of the envelope proteins of retroviruses,
1376
whereas the polymerase gene seems to have been protected
and is highly conserved.
Reassortment can occur randomly in RNA viruses with
segmented genomes, such as orthomyxoviruses, reoviruses
and bunyaviruses. In this type of recombination, genome
segments of two or more related viruses infecting the same
cell are exchanged. The process is an important source of
genetic variability in nature, permitting rapid adaptation of
viruses to new hosts, the development of viruses with new
antigenic   characteristics
and
changes
invirulence
Reassortment is generally restricted to taxonomically
related viruses, either viruses of the same species, such as
orthomyxo-viruses, or viruses belonging to the same
serogroup within a species, such as reoviruses and
bunyaviruses. Genetic reassortment plays a major role in
the epidemiology of human influenza A virus infections.
Periodically, viruses with novel
antigenic properties
emerge, facilitating more rapid
spreadthroughoutthe
human and animal
1 population.
Thereisconvincing
evidence that dual infection of pig populations with avian
and human influenza viruses accounts for the emergence
of new virulent subtypes which can spread to the human
population from close contact with pigs. In genetic
reactivation, infectious progeny are produced from
parental viruses, of which one or both are non-infectious,
following mixed infection of a cell. When infectious
progeny are produced from related viruses inactivated by
   n     
phenomenon is referred to as multiplicity reactivation.
Cross-reactivation or genome rescue occurs when an
inactivated  virus  becomes  capable  of  replicating after
acquiring genetic material from an infective virus
1377
Virus-host cell recombination
It is known that recombination between viral and cellular
genetic material occurs. Such recombination may be
important for virus evolution and virulence. Several
retroviruses have become potentially oncogenic by
incorporating  cellular oncogenes into  their genomes.
Integration of the cellular DNA into the viral genome
frequently results in a concomitant loss of viral genetic
material, resulting in replication-defective progeny viruses
whichrequirehelper
r   viruses   for  replication.  The
non-cytopathic biotype of bovine virus diarrhoea virus,
which causes persistent infection in cattle, may become
cytopathic through a process of RNA recombination and
cause mucosal disease. The specific change is cleavage of
the non-structural
1fusion protein, NS2-3, and the
subsequent separate expression of NS3. One mechanism
that allows this change is insertion of one or more cellular
ubiquitin gene sequences into a key region of the viral
genome.
Other interactions involving viruses
Viruses may interact in a number of ways at the level of
gene products. These types of interaction, which can result
in phenotypic alteration of  viral activity, include
complementation and phenotypic mixing.
In cells with dual infections, complementation can occur if
the defective gene product of one virus is substituted by
the gene product of another virus. This results in survival
         
        
1378
genome remains unchanged. Complementation can occur
between related and unrelated viruses; the defective
viruses are termed satellite viruses. Adeno-associated
viruses, which are members of the Parvoviridae, can
replicate only in the nucleus of cells simultaneously
infected with an ade-novirus. Hepatitis delta virus, a
satellite virus of humans, requires co-infection with
       
provision of envelope proteins.
Structural proteins may be exchanged following infection
of a cell, usually by two related viruses, a process known
as phenotypic mixing. One form of this type of interaction,
transcapsidation, involves complete or occasionally partial
exchange of capsids between non-enveloped
1viruses
Phenotypic mixing also occurs in enveloped viruses which
acquire envelopes when budding from host cells. The
progeny nucleocapsids of one virus may be released from a
cell surrounded by an envelope containing glycoproteins
specifiedby
another
virus.
Defectiveoncogenic
retro-viruses, which are dependent on helper viruses for
replication, may derive envelopes
from hostcell
membrane
which contain glycoproteins encoded by their helper
viruses. Phenotypic mixing does not involve genetic
change as it is a transient event.
Viral genomic sequence analysis
Cell culture techniques are no longer required for
producing sufficient quantities of virus for detailed studies
It is now possible to produce large amounts of viral nucleic
acid using either molecular cloning techniques or by use of
1379
the polymerase chain reaction following extraction of viral
nucleic acid from clinical samples. The nucleic acids of
bovine papillomavirus and rabbit haemorrhagic disease
virus have been  analysed and sequenced
1without
cultivation of these viruses in vitro. This has provided
valuable   information    about    both
1viruses,allowing
altermative approaches  to  diagnosis  and  vaccination
procedures. In recent years, automated methods for
sequencing  viral  genomes
S have become  simpler  and
cheaper (see also Chapters 6 and 9). Sequences, both
partial and complete, of a wide range of microorganisms
are retrievable from international databanks such as
GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank).
Viral genome sequencing has been used for many years to
help establish phylogenetic relationships among viruses. It
has also been used to great effect in the field of molecular
epidemiology.The  genotyping
of  isolates  provides
information on the source and epidemiology of  viral
diseases of veterinary importance such as foot-and-mouth
disease and Venezuelan equine encephalitis. Functional
genomics is concerned with the linking of phenotypic traits
to specific genes. The identification of open reading
frames (ORFs) is relatively easy in viruses because
translatable sequences start with the methionine codon
(AUG). This facilitates the identification of genes
encoding  viral  structural  and  non-structural  proteins.
Information of this type is of considerable value in the
development of diagnostic reagents and antiviral drugs and
also in the design of novel vaccines (see Chapter 5)
Evolution of viruses
1380
Genetic change, arising from mutation and recombination.
occurs at different rates among families of viruses. Some
genetically controlled traits may confer a selective
advantage which relates to prevailing conditions and
selection pressures. Periodically, genomic change may
contribute to the emergence of major outbreaks of new
diseases. Point mutations in the genome of feline
panleukopenia virus or a closely related virus can confer
the ability to replicate in canine cells and have been
proposed as the event responsible for the emergence of
canine parvovirus which causes a serious disease in dogs,
first described during the late 1970s. Genomic change may
also account for infection of horses with Hendra virus and
of pigs with Nipah virus. Both of these paramyxoviruses
have wildlife reservoirs, probably fruit bats. Subsequent
with infected domestic animals illustrates the important
unforeseen consequences of viral genomic alteration
Influenza A virus and myxoma virus provide important
insights into the evolution of viruses. Influenza A viruses
can infect a wide range of animal species. Isolates of the
virus from birds and humans can infect pigs and, in this
species, reassortment can occur with the emergence of new
take place at intervals of more than 10 years, are most
likely to originate in south-east Asia because of high
population densities and close contact between humans
and domestic pigs and ducks. Virus variants produced in
this way may escape neutralization by antibodies and, by
becoming the dominant circulating strain, cause
pandemics. During the twentieth century, pandemics of
human influenza 0ccurred in 1900, 1918, 1957, 1968 and
1381
2009. The pandemics of 1957 (Asian influenza') and 1968
("Hong Kong influenza') were caused by reassortant
viruses that contained genetic segments of avian origin in a
human influenza genetic background. In 2009 a new strain
of influenza A virus swept through human populations
around the world. Genetic studies indicated similarities to
swine influenza isolates and pigs are susceptible to
infection but circulation of the virus has occurred primarily

Myxoma virus is a poxvirus that causes a mild infection in
Sylvilagus species, the native American rabbit. It is
transmitted mechanically by biting arthropods feeding on
infected animals, particularly fleas and mosquitoes. The
virus causes serious, often fatal, disease in European
rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus. The European rabbit.
       
mid-nineteenth century, became a major agricultural pest.
Myxoma virus was released into the Australian rabbit
population in 1950 in an attempt to control numbers. Case
fatality
rates of more than 99% during dramatic
summertime epizootics were initially recorded.  The
disease tended to disappear during winter months, due to
1383
the greatly reduced rabbit numbers and decreased
mosquito activity. In such circumstances less virulent viral
mutants, which caused a more prolonged disease course
with a greater opportunity for transmission, were selected.
Subsequently, attenuated strains of the virus became
dominant. This resulted in a recovery rate in infected
rabbits exceeding 1o%, with the selection of genetically
more resistant rabbits. The case fatality rate for a particular
strain of virus in serial infection studies on rabbits from
areas where repeated outbreaks occurred declined from
90% to 50%. However, this trend to avirulence did not
disease in European rabbits. It was found that a level of
virulence associated with replicationwas required to
ensure sufficiently high levels of virus in the skin to permit
transmission to occur. Virulent strains of the virus became
re-established  in  the  genetically  resistant  populations
ensuring further efficient transmission of the virus. In
1968, the European rabbit flea was released to improve
transmission of the virus in areas where mosquitoes had
not been effective vectors. In rabbit populations in which
this flea flourished, the seasonal incidence of myxomatosis
changed from sharp summer outbreaks to protracted winter
and spring outbreaks. A dynamic equilibrium currently
exists between virulence of the virus and genetic resistance
of the rabbit population (Fenner, 2010). However, rabbit
numbers are substantially reduced compared with their
flourishingpopulation

myxomatosis.
Thus, despite the restrictions imposed on viruses by their
limited genome size, these agents utilize many different

mechanisms in order to subvert the host to diversify.

Propagation of viruses and virus-cell interactions
Viruses exhibit considerable diversity both in their ability
to survive outside the host and in their cultural
requirements. Some viruses, such as those causing enteric
disease in animals, tolerate wide pH ranges and are
relatively stable in the environment. In contrast, other
viruses are labile and only survive for short periods outside
the host. Enveloped viruses are readily inactivated by lipid
solvents, such as chloroform and ether, and by various
detergents such as sodium deoxycholate. Viruses are
sensitive to ultraviolet and gamma irradiation. Because of
their diploid genome, retroviruses are more resistant than
other viruses to these forms of radiation. Enveloped
viruses are more thermolabile than those without
envelopes. As a rule, the rate of inactivation can be
measured in seconds at 60°C, in minutes at 37°C, in hours
at 20°C and in days at 4°C. Ice crystal formation during
freezing damages viruses, especially enveloped viruses.
The infectivity of viruses is retained for long periods when
they are stored at -70°C or when they are freezedried
Storage at-20°C in conventional freezers is an
i     s
storage in liquid nitrogen at -l96°C can be achieved by
rapid freezing of small aliquots of high-titred viral
suspensions in a medium containing a high concentration
of protective protein or a cryoprotective agent such as
dimethyl sulphoxide. Freeze-drying involves dehydration
of frozen viral suspensions under vacuum in glass
ampoules which are then sealed to preserve the vacuum.
1386
Lyophilization is employed for the preservation of
valuable seed stocks of viruses and for storage of modified
live viral vaccines.
Propagation of viruses
As viruses replicate only in living cells, a source of viable
cells is required for their growth. Tissue culture is widely
used for virus propagation; inoculation of chick embryos
production of particular viruses. Propagation is required
for the isolation and identification of viruses involved in
disease, for the titration of viruses for vaccine production
and for the provision of stocks for research purposes.
Tissue culture
Techniques for tissue culture, the growth and maintenance
of living tissue in vitro, can be grouped under two
headings: explant cultures and cell cultures. Originally,
methods for growing cells involved using small fragments
or explants of tissue. This technique is still used for
isolating viruses from animals with persistent diseases
such as caprine arthritis-encephalitis In a special form of
explant culture, termed organ culture, the size and type of
the tissue fragment is sufficient to retain tissue
architecture. Explant tracheal cultures are required for the
isolation of some coronaviruses.
Digestion of tissue into individual cells is used in cell
culture preparation. Dispersion of cells from tissue
involves mechanical cutting or chopping of the tissue into
small pieces followed by digestion, using trypsin or other
1387
proteolytic enzymes. The liquid or semi-solid culture
medium in which cells are grown must supply
the required environmental conditions and nutrients. It
must be isotonic and be maintained at physiological pH
values. There must also be a supply of inorganic ions.
carbohydrate (usually glucose), amino acids, vitamins,
growth factors, peptides and proteins. Some cells grow in
chemically defined media but usually natural products
such as foetal calf serum, yeast extract or embryo extract
are incorporated in the medium. Phenol red is commonly
added as a pH indicator. A bicarbonate buffer is often used
to maintain the correct pH. However, exposure to air in an
open system results in an increase in pH. Cells can be
grown in sealed containers, or exogenous CO2 may be
provided at a rate of 5 to 10%
Cell cultures may
be
primary, semi-continuous or
continuous. Primary cell cultures are derived directly from
tissues and contain many cell types. Tissues from foetuses
or from neonatal animals are more suitable for tissue
culture preparation than those from mature animals. For
the isolation of a specific virus, the most sensitive systems
are primary cell lines derived from the target tissue of the
virus in a susceptible animal species. The cells in these
cultures retain many of the characteristics of cells in the
intact organ. However, the sensitivity of a given cell
solely on the organ of origin as it is frequently possible to
isolate viruses that infect one body system in cells derived
from a different system. The numbers of cell divisions

yculturesarerelatively

Accordingly, primary cultures must be prepared at
frequent intervals. Primary cultures can be passaged by
1388
dispersing the primary monolayer with trypsin, usually
with added ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid, and
distributing the cells on to fresh surfaces to form secondary
cell cultures. The number of further passages is finite and
an end point, termed the Hayflick limit, is eventually
reached. The Hayflick limit is related to the longevity of
the animal species from which the cells derived. Cells
which are nurtured may survive beyond the Hayflick limit,
continue to grow and constitute a cell line. The cells of
semi-continuous   or  diploid  cell
1lines  retain  their
characteristic diploid chromosomal constitution and can
support the growth of a widerangeof viruses.Suchcell
lines, most of which are predominantly fibroblastic, tend to
die out between the 30th and 50th passage.
Continuous cell lines are derived from either normal or
neoplastic tissue and can be passaged indefinitely. In these
cell lines, referred to as heteroploid cell lines, the cells
have an abnormal number of chromosomes. In general,
they  are  not  as  sensitive
as either primary or
semi-continuous cell lines for virus isolation. However,
viruses can usually be adapted to grow in continuous cell
lines. Established cell lines facilitate large-scale growth of
viruses for vaccine production or research purposes. Well
characterized continuous celllines can be obtained from
commercial organizations which specialize in preserving
and distributing stock. Samples can be purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection and the European
Collection of Cell Cultures. Continuous cell lines with
recognized names include Madin Darby bovine kidney
(MDBK) and Crandell feline kidney (CRFK). Following
prolonged passaging, continuous cell lines may become
contaminated with Mycoplasma species or viruses and may

acquire altered  characteristics such as  increased or
decreased   susceptibility

laboratories freeze early stocks of cells and, periodically.
revive cells from the frozen stock in order to ensure
maintenance of characteristics. Cells can be stored in a
viable state for long periods at temperatures below
-130°C, typically at -196°C using liquid nitrogen.
Cryoprotective agents such as dimethyl  sulphoxide  or
glycerol are usually added to the medium in which cells
are suspended.
Detection of viral growth in cell cultures
Viral growth in cell culture, which results in damage to
infected cells, may be detectable by light microscopy.
Microscopic changes in infected cells, termed cytopathic
effect (CPE), include change in shape, cell detachment,
fusion leading to syncytium formation, the presence of
inclusion bodies and cell death. On primary isolation.
some viruses do not produce CPE. Following passage on
to fresh monolayers, they may become cytopathic. The full
range of the effects of viral infection on cultured cells,
especially inclusion body formation, may be demonstrable
onlyby staining.
 Inclusion   bodies  are  intracellular
structures which have characteristic staining features. In
virus-infected cells, they may be composed of viral nucleic
acid, viral protein or altered cellular material. Inclusion
bodies, which may be single or multiple, may be located in
the cytoplasm or the nucleus. They are described as
acidophilic, when stained by eosin, and basophilic, when
stained by haematoxylin. Intracytoplasmic inclusions may
be found in cells infected with poxviruses, reoviruses,
rabies virus and paramyxoviruses, while intranuclear
1390
inclusions occur in cells infected with adenoviruses,
herpesviruses and parvoviruses. Infections with some

Non-cytopathic  viruses
 require

methods. Enveloped viruses belonging to some families
insert viral glycoproteins into the plasma membrane of
infected cells. These glycoproteins may induce cell fusion,
producing syncytia, or promote
haemadsorption, the binding of erythrocytes to the surface
of infected cells. Syncytia may be formed in cell cultures
infected with lentiviruses, paramyxoviruses and some
herpesviruses.  Cells

Serological tests may be required for the specific
identification of a viral species. A useful method for
detection  and  specific identification  is  infection  of
susceptible cells grown as monolayers on coverslips in
Leighton tubes or in flat-bottomed vials. Following
fixation of infected cells, virus can be identified by
employing a fluorescein-labelledantibody.Monoclonal or
polyclonal

dependingon
availability and the level of specificity required. This
technique is independent of any cytopathic or other
property of the test virus and contributes to the speed and
sensitivity of the isolation procedure. However, a separate
conjugate is required for the specific detection of each
virus species. Specific antibodies against viruses can also
be utilized in virus neutralization tests to block cytopathic
effects    and

inhibition assays to inhibit the erythrocyte-binding activity
of viruses. Neutralization assays are the definitive methods
for distinguishing many viruses and defining serotypes.
Although immunoelectron microscopy is more sensitive
and specific than direct electron microscopy, it cannot be
used as a general screening method for viruses in clinical
samples.
Embryonated eggs
Formerly, embryonated eggs were used extensively for
virus isolation. Decline in the use of embryonated eggs has
resulted from improvements in tissue culture techniques.
However, inoculation of embryonated eggs remains the
preferred method for isolation of influenza A viruses and
formanyavian viruses. In  order toexclude
maternally-derived anti-viral antibodies, the source of the
1392
eggs requires careful selection: they should preferably be
eggs from specific pathogen-free flocks. Passage in
embryonated eggs has proved useful for attenuating certain
viruses used in the production of modified live virus
vaccines.
Embryonated eggs may be inoculated using a number of
defined routes (Fig. 57.1). Viruses can be inoculated into
the allantoic cavity, the amniotic cavity or the yolk sac.
They can also be inoculated on to the chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM). In addition, well developed chick
embryos can be inoculated intravas-cularly The route
selected for inoculation is largely determined by the tissue
affinity of each particular virus. Evidence of the effect of
viral growth includes death or dwarfing of the embryo and
the formation of pocks on the CAM. Haemagglutination or
immunofluorescence may be used as additional tests for
the detection of virus.
Experimental animals
For ethical reasons, experimental infection of animals is
now used less frequently than formerly. A number of
alternative methods for the growth and study of viruses are
available. However, for several virus families, the use of
cell culture for isolation is of limited value and animal
inoculation remains the preferred procedure. Suckling
mice are used for the detection of arthropod-bormne viruses
and for rabies virus. Inoculation of the natural host species
is a requirement for the isolation of some viruses.
Challenge experiments in the natural host species may be
necessary to evaluate vaccines. The production of antisera
requires inoculation of laboratory animals with virus.
1393
Investigation of the pathogenetic mechanisms relating to
viral infections and the subsequent immune response of the
host frequently require inoculation of either laboratory
animals or natural hosts.
Determination of virus concentration

when
standardizing
virus
neutralization
or
haemagglutination-inhibition  assays  or  when  producing
whole virus vaccines, accurate standardization of virus
concentration is essential. It is also necessary when
determining the minimum dose of virus required to
produce clinical disease.  Titration  methods may be
physical, used to measure the total number of virions
present (employing electron microscopy) or biological,
used to calculate the number of infectious virions by
inoculating a susceptible host or tissue culture system.
Alternatively, a measure of a specific viral activity such as
haemagglutination may be used or the concentration of
viral    antigen
may
be
determined.
 Some  titration
procedures are quantal, providing an approximation of the
number of virions in a preparation. Estimation of viral
concentration by quantal techniques is adequate for most
experimental or diagnostic purposes. Typically, these
assays are carried out using serial ten-fold dilutions of a
given virus preparation to inoculate several replicate host
or cell culture systems per dilution. The end point in mice
or embryonated eggs is usually death and the unit is
expressed as the 50% lethal dose (LDso). In cell culture
systems, the end point is expressed as the 50% tissue
culture infective dose (TCIDso). The results are usually
expressed as a logio value per ml of the original undiluted
1394
specimen.

Reed-Muench and by Karber are frequently employed in
these calculations.

The concentration of haemagglutinating viruses is often
expressed in haemagglutinating (HA) units. The HA unit is
equivalent to the highest dilution of the virus suspension

The cell sheets are then overlaid with tissue culture

medium containing agar which prevents spread of virus
throughout the cell culture while permitting cell-to-cell
transfer. As a result, cytopathic viruses produce foci of cell
death around the replication sites, which then appear as
clear areas called plaques. Based on the number of plaques
and the dilution and size of the inoculum, the titration end
point is calculated and expressed as plaque forming units
(pfu) per ml. Although it is possible for a single virion to
produce one plaque, 1n
1 practice the virion : pfu ratio for
most animal viruses is seldom less than 10 : 1. Even within
a single virus preparation, there appears to be substantial
microheterogeneity
as
not
all
virus particles in a
preparation can form plaques. The multiplicity of infection
(moi) is the ratio of number of infectious virus particles to
a known number of cells in a culture. It might be expected
that an moi of 1 pfu would result in every cell becoming
infected but in practice only about two-thirds of the cell
population are found to be infected. This occurs because
the distribution of virus particles among a population of
cells is random with a distribution pattern that is best
described mathematically by the Poisson distribution. An
moi of ≥5 is required to ensure that more than 99% of cells
become infected.

Virus-host cell interactions
Virus infections may produce effects ranging from latency
to cell death (Table 57.1). Infections may be productive or
non-productive, consequences influenced by the ability of
the virus to replicate effectively in a given cell type. When
a host cell allows virus replication to proceed, it is said to
be permissive. This state may not be static as occurs when
latent infections are reactivated following a period of
quiescence or non-productive interaction. Reactivation
tends to occur when latently infected animals are subjected
to stressful environmental conditions.
Mechanisms of cell injury
Cytopathic viruses kill cells which they infect. Frequently,
cell necrosis is the consequence of the cumulative effects
of a number of biochemical changes induced by viral
replication, resulting in the production of ultrastructural
lesions. Cell death due to necrosis tends to occur late in the
viral replication cycle after progeny virus production is
complete and cytolysis may in fact facilitate the release of
virions.
Reoviruses,
poxviruses, 
picornaviruses,
paramyxoviruses  and   r
rhabdoviruses  can    inhibit   the
transcription of host cell RNA to permit synthesis of viral
mRNA. This alteration of host cell metabolism may relate
to interference with protein synthesis due to the production
of virus-encoded factors. Herpesviruses, influenza viruses
and vesicular stomatitis virus inhibit processing of host
cell mRNA by interfering with the splicing of the primary
cellular mRNA transcripts.
Rapid
1 and  pronounced
shutdown of protein synthesis occurs in cells infected with
picornaviruses, poxviruses and
herpes-viruses.  Other
1397
viruses such as adenoviruses cause a gradual shutdown of
cellular activity at a late stage in the viral replicative cycle.
The  viral mechanisms  which block  protein synthesis
include competition for ribosomes from large amounts of
viral mRNA, degradation of cellular mRNA by viral
enzymes, interference with cellular mRNA translation and
the alteration of the intracellular ionic environment in
favour  of  viral mRNA translation.  Viral  proteins  of
lentiviruses and adenoviruses inhibit the processing of
cellular proteins and their transportation from the
endoplasmic reticulum. Accumulations of viral structural
proteins occurring late in infection may be directly toxic
for host cells. Humoral and cellular immune responses
directed against viral proteins incorporated into the plasma
membrane of the host cell in vivo may be cytotoxic.
Programmed cell death, apoptosis, can be induced by viral
infection. In apoptosis, activation of cellular endonuclease
leads to fragmentation of cellular DNA. The resulting
DNA fragments produce a characteristic pattern of evenly
spaced  bands  when  electrophoresed  in agarose   gel.
Apoptosis may be triggered by certain viruses in the early
stages of infection, resulting in the death of individual cells
prior to virus replication. This event could be an important
host defence mechanism. Some viruses produce substances
which block apoptosis, thus prolonging cell survival.
Non-cytopathic viral infections
Viruses such as retroviruses, which are usually
non-cytopathic, do not interfere with protein synthesis in
host cells. These viruses frequently produce persistent
infections with progressive changes which eventually lead
1398
01
cell
death.
Members   of the   sub-family
Alphaherpesvirinae
typically  produce productive lytic
infections, usually
in epithelial cells. At the sites of
productive infection, progeny viruses enter sensory nerve
fibres and are transported in the axoplasm to sensory nerve
ganglia. Latent infection develops within the neuronal
perikarya. Viral replication is restricted because stimuli for
replication are not produced in the non-dividing neurons.
The intracellular viral DNA is present in a circular
episomal form in association with nucleosomes, and
transcription is limited to a few latency-associated
transcripts (LATs). The function of LATs is not known.
They do not appear to be translated into proteins and they
are not essential for the maintenance of the latent state.
The lack of viral protein expression allows infected
neurons to remain undetected by the immune system.
Multiple copies of the viral DNA may be demonstrable in
latently infected host cells. Episodes of reactivation with
production of  infectious
progeny virus can occur
periodically. The newly produced virions are transported
in the sensory nerve fibres to the superficial sites of the
primary infection where they may again induce lytic
lesions. The mechanism of reactivation is not fully
understood. Certain stimuli or stress factors, such as
trauma,

termed provirus, into the host chromosome. This allows
propagation of the provirus along with host chromosomes.
Integration of provirus, while not destroying the cell, may
alter the host genotype and the expression of host genes.
The genomes of DNA viruses such as papillomaviruses are
maintained in cells as circular episomal molecules. Viral
replication, which is promoted by viral proteins, is
synchronized with host cell division.
Viral oncogenesis
A number of DNA and RNA viruses cause neoplastic
transformation  of cells
(Table57.2).
Transformation
results from interference with growth signals in cells. The
consequent alteration  in cell growth affects saturation
density, growth factor requirements and anchorage
dependency. Normally, cells stop dividing once they form
a confluent layer covering the available surface area of a
solid substrate. Transformed cells do not exhibit contact
inhibition of cell growth and continue growing, piling up
into multiple layers. The normal dependence of cells for
1400
growth factors in the culture medium is often reduced or
 i  s  s r 
fibroblast cells will normally grow in vitro only on a solid
glass or plastic surface. Transformation of cells results in a
loss of this dependence
Central to the understanding of the mechanisms involved
in tumour production by viruses was the discovery of
oncogenes. Originally recognized in retroviruses, more
than 60 oncogenes, termed v-onc genes, have been
identified. Cellular genes, c-onc genes or proto-oncogenes,
corresponding to most v-onc genes, are present in normal
cells
Sinwhichthey
regulate
 cell division  and
differentiation. Cellular oncogenes encode proteins which
function as growth factors, growth factor receptors,
1s generally accepted that v-onc genes of retroviruses were
acquired during the evolution of these viruses following
virus-host cell interaction. Central to this process is the
possession of a unique enzyme, reverse transcriptase, and
the incorporation of a DNA copy of viral RNA into the
host genome. Two important consequences of the
integration of provirus into the host genome are the ability
of retroviruses to transduce cellular genetic material and
the insertional activation (or occasionally inactivation) of
cellular genes. Retroviruses may exert an oncogenic effect
by carrying v-onc genes (transducing retroviruses) or
expression of c-onc genes (cis-activating retroviruses). The
v-onc genes carried by rapidly transforming retroviruses
differ in certain respects from the c-onc genes from which
they were derived. They are under the control of strong
viral promoters known as long terminal repeats (LTRs),
1401
carry mutations as a result of the high error rate of reverse
transcriptase and may be joined to other viral genes in a
way that modifies their function. As a result, they are
outside of the control of normal cellular gene regulation,
and oncogene proteins may be overproduced or may
function in an abnormal way leading to uncontrolled cell
division. In contrast, slowly transforming retroviruses lack
a v-onc gene and give rise to tumours in a random manner.
Insertion of provirus (insertional mutagenesis) with its
greatly increase the production of the normal c-onc gene
protein.
The oncogenes of DNA viruses are not usually derived
from cellular genes. The DNA viruses are generally
present in cells as circular episomal nucleic acid, and their
oncogenes encode early viral proteins that inactivate
tumour suppressor proteins such as retinoblastoma (Rb)
and p53. These tumour suppressor proteins regulate
mammalian cell growth by controlling the progression of
the cell cycle through holding the cell at the Gl phase of
the cell cycle. The strategy of the DNA viruses is to drive a
resting cell to enter S phase, thereby inducing the cellular
gene-encoding activities necessary for DNA replication.
Normally this cell cycle deregulation is of no consequence
because the infected cell eventually dies. However, if the
replication cycle of the virus is curtailed (non-productive
infection), overexpression of the gene products may occur,
contributing to oncogenic  transformation and inducing
uncontrolled replication of the host cell. In contrast to
other DNA viruses associated with transformation, the
genome of the herpesvirus, Marek's disease virus, appears
to
1402
contain a number of v-onc genes similar to those of
retroviruses.

Pathogenesis of viral diseases
Viral pathogenesis, the production of disease as a result of
viral infection, is concerned with the cellular events and
pathological mechanisms that connect the virus to cell/
tissue/organ damage and the resulting clinical signs.
Although viruses are obligate cellular parasites, viral
infection does not always result in apparent clinical
disease. A broader definition of viral pathogenesis
encompasses the process of infection following entry into
a susceptible host by a virus, irrespective of outcome. The
mechanisms whereby viruses produce disease relate not
only to direct interference with cellular functions but also
to indirect effects caused by host responses (immune/
inflammatory) to infection. Virulence refers to the relative
ability of viruses to produce disease in a host. It is
dependent on the attributes of both the virus and its host.
and is influenced by factors such as the dose and route of
entry of the virus and the species, age and immune status
of the host. Frequently, comparisons are made between
related viruses as to their virulence, and a particular isolate
may be described as more virulent or less virulent than
others. Because of the complex interactions between
viruses and their hosts, clinical disease does not
necessarily follow exposure to a virulent virus. Viral
infections may result in subacute, acute or chronic or
persistent disease. Although present in the tissues, some
viruses which exhibit latency produce disease only under
defined environmental conditions. In slow viral infections.

Routes of infection
Viruses can infect vertebrate hosts by a variety of routes.
In many instances, viruses must first attach to and infect
cells on the skin and other body surfaces. Viruses can be
introduced into the body through breaks in surface
epithelia such as scratches, abrasions or wounds. They
        
through bites or following the use of contaminated needles
or   surgical   equipment.
When intact, the stratified
squamous epithelium of the epidermis usually presents an
effective barrier to infection. Because they have an affinity
for epidermal cells, papillomaviruses replicate in the
epidermis producing local proliferative lesions. In contrast,
viruses such as myxomavirus of rabbits and sheeppox

other tissues through blood vessels and lymphatics.
Mucous membranes, which present a minimal physical
barrier to infection, are coated with a layer of mucus. This
viscous secretion provides some physical protection and,
in addition, often contains protective immunoglobulins. In
the respiratory tract, infectious agents may be moved
towards the oralcavity by the coordinated activity of
ciliated epithelium. Peristalsis in the intestinal tract and the
flushing action of urine in the urinary tract assist in the
1405
removal of infectious agents from these anatomical
locations. Some viruses, which are spread venereally, may
invade through abrasions, frequently resulting from sexual
activity, in the urethral, vaginal or anal mucosa.

In order to establish infection in the gastrointestinal traci
(GIT), enteric viruses must evade local mucosal immune
defences and either attach to specific receptors on
epithelial cells or be engulfed by M cells, specialized
epithelial cells overlying Peyer's patches in the ileum. In
the GIT, prevailing environmental conditions are generally
unfavourable for virus survival. Successful viral pathogens
of the GIT, which damage intestinal cells, are usually
unaffected by gastric acid, are tolerant to bile salts and are
resistant
toinactivation
 by proteolytic   enzymes.
Remarkably, the infectivity of some viruses such as
proteolytic enzymes. With the notable exception of
coronaviruses, enteric viral pathogens are non-enveloped
and therefore hardy'. Bile salts generally have an adverse
effect on viral envelopes. The basis for the resistance of
the envelopes of coronaviruses to bile salts is unknown.
Arboviruses
Arboviruses are defined as viruses maintained in nature
through biological transmission between vertebrate hosts
by haematophagous arthropods. The viruses multiply in
the tissues of the arthropod vector. The most important
arthropod vectors are mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies and
midges. The vector remains infected for life. The term
‘arbovirus’ has no taxonomic status. It is applied to viruses
belonging to several viral families including Togaviridae,
Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Arenaviridae and
Bunyaviridae. Most arboviruses are maintained in complex
sylvatic life cycles involving a primary vertebrate host and
a primary arthropod host. Such cycles usually remain
undetected unless domestic animals and humans encroach.
1407
Alternatively, due to ecological change, the virus may
escape its primary cycle by means of a secondary vector or
vertebrate host. As a result, the virus is brought into the
peridomestic environment. Domestic animals and humans
are generally ‘deadend’ hosts as they do not develop
sufficient viraemia to contribute to the transmission of the
virus. The majority of arbovirus infections are zoonoses,
are found in tropical developing countries, and have a
distinct  geographical distribution.  Ecological  factors
limiting the distribution of particular arboviruses include
temperature, rainfall and distribution of both vertebrate
reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors.
Dissemination in the host
Following infection, local spread from cell to cell
frequently
occurs.
When
viruses bud from cells,
dissemination may be influenced by the manner and site of
budding. Release of viral progeny from the apical surface
of mucosal cells favours localized infection in tubular
structures such as the air passages and the intestine. In
contrast, release of virus from the basal surface into
subepithelial tissues facilitates systemic infection. Factors
which may limit the ability of some viruses to spread
systemically include the absence of suitable cell receptors
and lack of permissive cells. In addition, optimal viral
replication may occur only in dividing cells, in cells of a
certain age/differentiation state or at a temperature lower
than core body temperature. These virus and host factors
may play an important role in determining the tropism of a
virus, and account for the selective infection of certain
cells in particular organs. In subepithelial tissues, viruses
frequently enter the lymphatic network and may be
1408
transported to the regional lymph nodes either as free
virions or in infected macrophages. From the nodes, virus
may pass to the efferent lymphatics and the thoracic duct,
eventually entering the bloodstream, the
   ss    
transported along peripheral nerves. The preferential use of
one route of spread does not necessarily exclude spread by
other routes.
Haematogenous spread
Primary replication at the site of entry is frequently
followed by transitory low-titred primary viraemia which
results in infection of various organs including those of the
reticuloendothelial system and the vascular endothelium.
Further multiplication at these locations is followed by a
sustained, high-titred
1secondary
viraemia.Inthe
bloodstream, virus may be free in the plasma or associated
with cellular elements.
The body employs a number of mechanisms for clearing
virus from the circulation. These include complement and
antibody and the phagocytic　 cells of 
the
reticuloendothedial system in the liver, spleen, lung and
lymph nodes. The magnitude and duration of a viraemia
are determined by the amount of virus entering the
bloodstream   and
the  effectiveness  of 
clearance
mechanisms. Large viruses are cleared more rapidly from
the circulation than small viruses. There is rapid removal
of viruses opsonized by antibody or by complement.
Viraemias, in which virus remains free in the plasma, such
as those associated with parvoviruses, flaviviruses,
togaviruses and picornaviruses, are usually of short
1409
duration, with clearance generally coinciding with the
appearance of neutralizing antibodies in the serum.
Prolonged viraemias are features of infections with viruses
such as canine distemper virus, feline leukaemia virus and
Marek's disease
virus, which  are
associatedwith
circulating cells. These viruses are often unaffected by the
action of antibodies and complement. Some viruses like
lentiviruses can replicate in monocytes or lymphocytes
and, in many instances, produce persistent viraemias.
Invasion of tissues and organs from the blood can occur in
a number of ways which may relate to virus interaction
with macrophages or vascular endothelial cells. Viruses
such as picornaviruses, retroviruses, togaviruses and
parvoviruses can infect endothelial cells and, following
replication, are released into the tissues of target organs. In
other instances, following endocytosis by endothelial cells.
viruses may be translocated to the basal surface and
released into tissues by exocytosis. In some anatomical
locations such as the choroid plexuses, virions may pass
from the bloodstream into surrounding tissues through
fenestrated endothelium. Viruses can be transported into
tissue spaces inside lymphocytes or monocytes as these
cells migrate from
1the circulation.
Engulfment and
destruction of viruses by the phagocytic cells of the
reticuloendothelial  system are an  important defence
mechanism which limits viraemia. In some instances,
phagocytosis of viruses by these cells may result in
transfer of virions to distant sites in the body.
Neural spread
1410
Neurotropic viruses such as rabies virus, Aujeszky's
disease virus and Borma disease virus can invade the CNS
through peripheral nerves. Enveloped viruses are usually
transported as naked nucleocapsids by axoplasmic flow.
Within the CNS, dissemination frequently involves spread
across synaptic junctions. In addition, spread within
peripheral nerves from the CNS to other locations may
occur. Alphaherpesviruses can spread in peripheral nerves
from the site of infection to ganglia, causing latent
infections.  Reactivation of  infection  may result in
recrudescence of superficial lesions following transport of
virus from the ganglia along nerve fibres.
Clinical signs
The signs of viral infections reflect both the site of virus
replication in tissues and host responses. Some viruses kill
the cells in which they replicate, producing clinical signs
that relate to the anatomical location and function of the
affected cells. Because of the considerable reserve and
regenerative capacity of the liver, the loss of large numbers
of hepatocytes may  not result  in significant clinical
disturbance. In contrast, loss of relatively few neurons may
have  severe  clinical
]consequences.I
In some viral
infections, loss of specialized functions or reduction in
functional efficiency in infected cells may induce clinical
signs. Viral infections of the respiratory and intestinal
tracts are frequently complicated by secondary bacterial
infections, which may contribute to the development of
clinical signs and associated pathology. Bacterial species
present in the normal flora may contribute to these
opportunistic  infections.  Denuded  epithelial  surfaces,
impaired clearance mechanisms, or increased availability
1411
of bacterial nutrients may promote bacterial proliferation,
leading to secondary infections.
A number of viruses, including infectious bursal disease
virus of poultry and feline immunodeficiency virus, target
cells of the immune system. Progressive depletion of
lymphocytes can lead to an immunodeficient state. As a
consequence, affected animals may present with a variety
of clinical signs, due to secondary bacterial infection. In
most viral infections, the
immune system has an important protective role. However,
there are viral infections in which the principal lesions
result from hypersensitivity reactions and subsequent
immunopathological changes. Immune complexes formed
in persistent viral infections such as feline infectious
peritonitis and equine infectious anaemia are responsible
for vasculitis and glomerulonephritis.
Abortion following viral infection is usually indicative of
substantial damage to the tissues of the placenta or foetus.
The effect on the foetus is often influenced by the stage of
gestation and by the virulence of the virus. Infection with
virulent virus early in gestation generally results in foetal
death with resorption or abortion. Infection of pregnant
cattle with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) before
100 days’ gestation may result in abortion, congenital
defects or immunotolerance. If infection occurs at a later
stage during pregnancy, calves may be born with
congenital defects, whereas infection towards the end of
pregnancy induces a protective immune response.
When viral epidemics occur in susceptible populations, the
outcome   in  individual  animals   can    range  from
1412
asymptomatic infection to persistent or even fatal
infection. Host factors which may influence the outcome
include age, immune status, genetic factors and nutrition.
Young animals are generally more susceptible to viral
infections than older animals, whose increased resistance
can usually be attributed to maturation of the immune
system, and/or cell differentiation and to immunological
memory. Reverse age resistance, although uncommon, is
well documented in rabbit haemorrhagic disease. In this
condition, rabbits less than 5 weeks of age do not develop
disease because the target organ, the liver, does not appear
to be susceptible early in life. Severe malnutrition may
exacerbate certain viral diseases, a possible consequence
of which may be depressed cell-mediated immunity.
Success in breeding birds with enhanced resistance to
avian leukosis and Marek's disease illustrates the influence
of genetic factors on disease susceptibility
Virus shedding and patterns of infection
The shedding of infectious virions from surfaces or
orifices
via aerosols, droplets, scabs, body fluids,
excretions and secretions (saliva, blood, semen, milk.
urine, faeces) allows transfer to other susceptible hosts.
Although shedding usually coincides with the onset of
clinical signs, it may begin earlier in some viral infections.
Respiratory viruses are usually transmitted in aerosols
generated by coughing and sneezing. Enteric viruses are
frequently shed in enormous quantities in faeces and can
generally survive in harsh environments. Viruses which
produce generalized infections may be shed by a number
of routes. Body fluids such as saliva, semen, urine and
milk may contain particular viruses. Arboviruses usually
1413
produce high--itred viraemias of short duration and rely on
appropriate  haematophagous  vectors  for  transmission.
Surgical procedures or blood sampling may  facilitate
spread of blood-borne viruses. Some viruses can be
transmitted vertically by the transplacental route or via the
birth canal. Endogenous retro-viruses are transmitted in the
DNA of germ cells.
The maintenance of infection in a population requires
continuous infection of susceptible animals. Two main
strategies have been adopted by viruses for this purpose,
namely acute infection and long-term persistence (Fig.
58.2).
Acute infection is characterized by a short clinical course,
with rapid elimination of virus from the tissues. In these
infections, there may be shedding of large amounts of
virus over a short period. To maintain infection in a
susceptible population, viruses which cause acute
infections must be either highly contagious, such as
influenza viruses, or capable of surviving for long periods
in the environment, as is the case with parvoviruses,
poxviruses and many enteric viruses.
Persistent viral infections are characterized by a prolonged
course with constant or intermittent shedding. These
infections, which may be acute initially, can persist in
either latent or chronic forms. Latent infections are
characterized by persistence of the virus in a non-
productive form, either integrated into the genome of the
host, as occurs with retrovirus, or as an episome, in the
case of herpesviruses. Periodic reactivation of productive
infection with shedding of infectious virus may occur. This
1414
type　 of infection　 is　 best exemplifiedby
alphaherpesviruses, such as feline herpesvirus 1, which
produce productive infections in epithelial cells and latent
infections in sensory neurons. The terms persistent
infections and chronic infections are sometimes used
interchangeably but, in general, chronic infection implies
that virus is constantly present (continuous replication) and
may be shed intermittently or continuously, generally at
low levels. This type of infection can occur when the
immune response of the host fails to eliminate virus from
the tissues within the time when immune clearance would
be expected to occur.
Infections characterized by long incubation periods of
months or years are referred to as slow infections.
Infections of this type, produced by lentiviruses, jaagsiekte
[ sd  a sd   
course, usually resulting in death.
Figure 58.2 Comparative features of acute, latent, chronic
and slowly progressing  viral infections in animals,
illustrating the duration of virus persistence in the tissues.
The time required for the development of clinical signs and
the pattern of virus shedding in each form of disease are
typical for the categories of infections illustrated. Although
virus shedding typically coincides with the development of
clinical signs, there is wide variation in the duration of
clinical signs and virus shedding among different families
of viruses. In slowly progressing viral infections, clinical
signs and shedding of virus usually persist until the animal
finally succumbs to the infection.

Mechanisms of persistence
Viruses that persist in the body usually employ a number
of strategies to ensure prolonged infections. For a virus to
persist in host tissues, some infected cells must survive.
Viruses have evolved a number of different strategies to
reduce pathogenic effects on host cells. Viruses that
1416
produce non-lytic infections are likely to cause chronic
infections. A number of viruses that are normally lytic
have been shown to be capable of establishing persistent
infections. Alphaherpesviruses, by exploiting the fact that
sensory neurons are only partly permissive, have the
   s  s     
non-dividing cells, the viruses persist as circular episomal
DNA   until   adverse   environmental   factors   induce
immunosuppression, which  permits  virus  replication.
Foot-and-mouth disease virus can persist for long periods
in the pharyngeal region of animals that have recovered
from the clinical disease. These animals may act as a
source of infection for susceptible animals. Adenoviruses
may persist in the body by producing low-grade, cycling
infection with small numbers of cells infected at any given
time. The evolution of defective-interfering or less
cytolytic variants may permit this type of infection to
occur.
Viruses have evolved severalstrategies to evade the
       
immunocompetent host. Certain tissues in the body.
referred to as immunologically privileged sites, are exempt
from immune surveillance.  The blood-brain barrier
restricts contact between lymphocytes and CNS tissues. In
addition, neurons
donot 
express the
major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class HH
molecules which are required for T cell recognition of
virus-infected cells, while other cells in the body,
expressing low levels of MHC class I, are targets for virus
infection. Certain viruses cause adjacent cells to fuse
together, permitting the viral
genometo
spread
contiguously from cell to cell, thus avoiding neutralizing
1417
antibody. This phenomenon is thought to be important in a
number of late-onset, progressive, fatal, nervous diseases
where the virus spreads gradually from neuron to neuron.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which is a rare
complication of measles virus infection, and old dog
encephalitis, which is a complication of canine distemper,
are conditions in which this form of viral spread may
       
herpesviruses, viral gene expression is diminished and
viral proteins are not expressed on the cell surface. Such
infected cells are not easily recognized by the immune
system. Viruses, particularly RNA viruses, undergo
frequent mutation. Variants with altered epitopes at sites
important for antibody neutralization or T cell recognition
can emerge. These variants may evade immune detection
and become the predominant infecting strain. This type of
antigenic variation has been described in influenza virus
infections as a consequence of alterations in the surface
glycoproteins,
haemagglutinin
  and   neuraminidase.
Although these viruses do not persist in individual infected
animals, they may persist in animal populations.
Lentiviruses, such as equine infectious anaemia (EIA)
virus, exhibit significant antigenic variation during
replication in infected animals. Recurrent episodes of
clinical disease can occur in individual horses with EIA, in
association  with  the  emergence of  antibody-escape
variants and subsequent viraemia. Infection with feline
immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a lentivirus, results in the
destruction of CD4+ lymphocytes, but the bone marrow
responds by increasing the rate of production of naive
CD4+ cells. The host's immune response against FIV
limits virus replication and the bone marrow continues to
produce adequate levels of these lymphocytes for months
1418
or years. Antigenic variation, which allows the virus to
circumvent the immune system, ensures a high rate of
virus production.  A  dynamic   equilibrium becomes
established between virus production and clearance by the
body. Eventually, the bone marrow is unable to
compensate, with a resultant drop in CD4+ cell levels and
immunodeficiency. It has been shown that some viruses
can down-regulate or block expression of host cell surface
markers such as MHC class I and class II molecules. Some
viral proteins appear to act defensively by interfering with
the function of anti-viral cytokines. Immune tolerance of
the type associated with congenital BVDV infection
permits persistent infection in calves. Affected calves have
a lifelong viraemia and are the principal source of infection
for other cattle.
An important epidemiological parameter used in the
mathematical modeling of the spread of infectious disease
through  a  population  is  reproduction  number  or
reproduction rate (R). The basic reproduction number (Ro)
is defined as the mean number of secondary cases arising
from a typical single infected case in a population, with no
immunity to the disease and without any control
interventions. This value is affected by the ability of the
virus to infect susceptible hosts, the duration of infectivity
of an infected host and the population density of
susceptible hosts. Underlying assumptions include equal
susceptibility and exposure of host animals and uniform
mixing of infected and susceptible animals. An important
threshold is defined when Ro = 1; values greater than 1
indicate that each primary case will give rise to more than
one secondary case and the infection will spread. Large
values of Ro indicate the possibility of a major epidemic.
1419
Values of Ro less than 1 indicate that the outbreak will
eventually die out, even if a number of secondary cases
occur. The proportion of a given population that must be
vaccinated to provide sufficient herd immunity to prevent
sustained spread of an infection is given by 1-1/Ro. The
rate at which an epidemic develops is expressed by Ro in
association with the generation time (Tg), that is, the time
from shedding of virus in primary infections to shedding of
virus in the resulting secondary cases.

Laboratory diagnosis of viral infections
Many viral diseases of animals can be diagnosed on the
basis of clinical signs, together with post-mortem findings
and histopathological changes. However, confirmation of
the involvement of specific viral pathogens frequently
requires specific laboratory procedures. Surveillance for
particular  viruses
isan
 important
taspectof the
management of valuable animals, such as bulls and
stallions, used for artificial insemination, which have the
potential to spread infection to many other animals. As
part of international trade regulations, certification of
freedom from certain viral diseases must accompany
animals exported to countries in which the diseases are
exotic.
Moreover, rapid
1 and
accurate
laboratory
confirmation of exotic viral diseases, including those with
zoonotic
potential,  is  essential  for  the  successful
implementation   of  eradication policies  and  for   the
protection of human health. Surveillance of animal
populations for new, emerging or re-emerging viral
diseases  is   an  important  responsibility   of  national
veterinary services.
More than 200 major viral diseases of veterinary
importance affect
animal
1species.Becauseofthe
considerable  resources required  for  the  provision  of
comprehensive diagnostic services in virology, national
diagnostic services are usually  concerned with those
diseases prevalent in a country. Moreover, laboratories
frequently provide a diagnostic service for particular
1421
animal species. Special laboratory containment facilities
are mandatory for some viruses, such as foot-and-mouth
disease virus, which cause highly contagious diseases. The
Office International des épizooties (OIE) in Paris, also
known as the World Organization for Animal Health,
monitors and publishes details of significant animal
disease outbreaks worldwide. Compilation and publication
of this information relies on international cooperation and
a network of laboratories dealing with viral diseases of
international importance.
Collection, preservation and transportation of samples
Failure to provide a suitably selected specimen for the
diagnostic laboratory is the single most important cause off
unreliable laboratory results. Important factors relating to
specimen collection and submission include: the timing of
specimen collection from a sick animal; the type, quality
and quantity of the specimen; the time taken for the
specimen to reach the laboratory, the suitability of the
medium inwhich
the
sample
is  stored
during
transportationand
the
 conditions
under
which
transportation took place. Ideally, specimens for laboratory
examination should be collected as early as possible from
affected animals when viral titres are highest and before
secondary    bacterial   or   fungal
1infectionsbecome
established. It is advisable to collect samples from
apparently normal in-contact animals as some of these
animals may be actively shedding virus. The specimens
selected for laboratory examination should relate to the
clinical signs or to lesion distribution post mortem. Swabs
from the oropharynx or nasopharyngeal aspirates are
suitable
1422
specimens for investigation of respiratory diseases.  In
enteric viral diseases, large numbers of virus particles are
shed in faeces. In those diseases characterized by viraemia.
virus may be demonstrable in cells of the buffy coat layer.
Preservation of the infectivity or antigenicity of viruses
may be required for particular tests. As many viruses are
labile, specimens for virus isolation should be collected
into transport medium, refrigerated and transmitted to the
laboratory without delay. Samples should be frozen at
-70°C if delay in delivery is anticipated. Freezing in a
domestic freezer at -20°C decreases the infectivity of most
viruses. Transport medium consists of buffered isotonic
saline containing a high concentration of protein, such as
bovine albumin or foetal calf serum, which prolongs virus
survival. Antibiotics and antifungal drugs are added in
order to inhibit the growth of contaminants. Samples for
electron microscopy in which demonstration of virion
morphology is the primary objective require less exacting
conditions for storage and transportation. When collecting
blood samples for molecular diagnostic tests, it should be
noted that the anticoagulant heparin is inhibitory for some
polymerase chain reaction procedures. Air-dried smears
for fluorescent antibody (FA) staining should be fixed in
  n s h   o    
preserve viral antigens. This fixation process allows
penetration of FA conjugates into cells. A similar fixation
procedure is required for cryostat sections of frozen tissues
prior to FA  staining. Formalin-fixed tissue samples
embedded in paraffin wax can be stored for many years
and used to demonstrate the presence of viral antigen by
immunohistochemical techniques.
1423
Guidance from clinicians regarding the possible aetiology
of the disease under investigation is essential for deriving
maximum benefit from laboratory tests. This requires an
accurate assessment of the history and clinical signs
together with a tentative clinical diagnosis. In some
instances, post-mortem and histopathological examination
of tissues may be sufficient for diagnostic purposes,
particularly if specific inclusion bodies are found in
infectedtissues.
Detection of virus, viral antigens or nucleic acid
The presence of virus in tissues can be confirmed by
isolation of live virus, by demonstration of virus particles
or viral antigen and by detecting viral nucleic acid
Laboratory diagnostic tests based on molecular biology
and antigen detection methods have become the methods
of choice for the rapid diagnosis of viral diseases.
Isolation of live virus
Virus isolation using cell culture, fertile eggs or
experimental animals is the standard against which other
diagnostic methods are usually compared. A monolayer
composed of a particular cell type cannot be expected to
support the growth of the diverse range of viruses which
cause animal diseases in a host of different cell types.
Laboratories usually have a limited range of cell lines most
often used for virus isolation and appropriate for the range
of samples received. Embryonated eggs are widely used
for the isolation of influenza A virus and avian viruses.
Because of ethical considerations and cost, virus isolation
in experimental animals is now seldom employed
1424
Virus isolation is a sensitive procedure when cultural
conditions are optimal for a particular virus and also
generates a supply of virus for further studies. This method
is suitable for the detection of many different viruses,
including  viruses  not suspected
1from the clinical
assessment and not previously recognized in clinical
disease  conditions
1n
 animals. However,
itis
labour-intensive, slow and expensive. A number of blind
passages may be required before a virus becomes adapted
to a particular cell line and, as a consequence, a test result
may not be available for some weeks. Because some
viruses do not produce a cytopathic effect, additional
detection procedures such as haemadsorption and FA
staining may be needed to demonstrate their presence in
cell cultures. Even when a virus produces a pronounced
cytopathic effect, additional tests are frequently required
for definitive identification. Shell vial culture refers to a
modified cell culture technique whereby cells are grown
on a coverslip placed at the base of a vial, the inoculum is
added and the vial is centrifuged. Following a suitable
incubation period, the coverslip is removed and subjected
toimmunofluorescent staining.
. This method frequently
provides enhanced sensitivity compared with conventional
viral culture. Mixed cell culture systems, in which the
simultaneous culture of a number of different cell types
takes place in a monolayer, have been used for virus
isolation. This system permits the isolation of a broader
range of viruses than a conventional monolayer and their
subsequent detection using monoclonal antibodies.
Electron microscopy
1425
Viruses can be demonstrated in diagnostic specimens by
electron microscopy. This method can be used not only to
recognize mixed viral infections, but also to detect viruses
that cannot be grown in vitro such as noroviruses.
Although  this  technique  is particularly useful for
identifying enteric viruses, it has serious
limitations, including limited sensitivity, high capital costs
and the need for a skilled operator. Large numbers of viral
particles (usually greater than 1o' per ml) must be present
in    clinical  samples
to ensure detection.Sufficient
concentrations of virus may be found in samples of faeces,
scabs, vesicular fluids and wart tissues to allow detection.
Moreover, viruses with similar morphology may be
difficult  to distinguish
1using
electronmicroscopy.
Members of a  viral family  usually  have identical
morphology and cannot be distinguished on this basis
alone and the use of additional techniques, such as
antibody labelling, may be necessary to definitively
identify the viral species. In a few viral families, such as
Poxviridae and Reoviridae, morphological differences do
exist at the generic level.
A number of methods are used for the preparation of
samples for examination. When preparing fluid samples,
low-speed centrifugation to remove large particulate debris
is  followed by ultracentrifugation
tosedimentvirus
particles. Negative staining with heavy metal compounds
such as phosphotungstic acid or uranyl acetate increases
contrast so that the brighter virions stand out against a dark
background. The addition of antiserum to the specimen in
immunoelectron microscopy enhances the sensitivity of
the procedure by clumping virus particles and facilitating
their recovery by centrifugation. Alternatively, antiserum,

Antiviral antibodies labelled with fluorochromes can be
used to detect viral antigens in clinical specimens,
particularly
respiratory
/specimens.
Enzyme-labelled
antiviral antibodies can also be used for this purpose.
When using procedures involving immunofluorescence, a
or mercury vapour lamp) is required in order to visualize
fluorescing material
(Fig. 59.1). Specific antibodies
labelled  with
fluorochromes，
 usually  fluorescein
(RITC), are employed to detect virus-infected cells in
specimens. The fluorochrome, exposed to light of a
particular wavelength, emits light at a slightly longer
wavelength, allowing demonstration of the labelled
antibody bound to virus particles. The technique is used to
detect virus-infected cells in fixed smears, cryostat
sections or monolayers
Direct and indirect immunofluorescent techniques can be
used to demonstrate virus or viral antigen in specimens
(Fig. 59.2).  In direct immunofluorescence, conjugated
antibody, specific for the particular virus, is applied to the
fixed specimen. Following incubation, the specimen is
washed to remove unbound antibody prior to microscopic
examination. The indirect method employs unlabelled
antiviral antiserum and a labelled antiglobulin, specific for
the species of animal from which the unlabelled antiserum
was derived. Immunofluorescence techniques are rapid and
1427
sensitive, but require careful interpretation as non-specific
fluorescence can occur in certain specimens.

Enzyme-labelled antibodies can also be used to identify
viruses or viral antigen in clinical specimens. Horseradish
peroxidase is the most common enzyme employed for
conjugation with specific antiserum. After binding to viral
antigen, antibody is identified by the addition of hydrogen
peroxide and a benzidine derivative to the preparation.
During the ensuing
reaction, the colourless soluble benzidine derivative is
converted to a coloured insoluble precipitate. For this
technique, paraffin-embedded and resin-embedded tissues
can be used and stained preparations do not fade when
stored for long periods. Moreover, the stained preparations
can

Endogenous tissue peroxidases, however, may produce
misleading reactions unless suitable controls are included.

immunohistochemical reactions. Biotin can be covalently

1  to   antibody
without
 interfering   with 
its
antigen-binding capacity. Avidin, bound to either a
fluorochrome or an enzyme, has a high affinity for the
biotin molecules linked to the antibody.
Solid-phase immunoassays
1429
In these assays, either antigen or antibody is immobilized
on to a surface. Suitable surfaces include polystyrene or
synthetic membranes for enzyme immunoassays and
radioimmunoassays; latex beads are often employed for
agglutination tests. These assays are sensitive and
relatively uncomplicated. Commercial tests based on these
methods have been developed for particular viruses.
Radioimmunoassays employ antibodies labelled with
radioisotopes, and the bound antibody is measured using a
gamma counter. These types of assays have largely been
superseded by safer immunoassay procedures. Enzyme
immunoassays,
usually
termed
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA), are currently widely used
for the immunodiagnosis of viral infections. In these
assays, antibodies are labelled with enzymes which
produce a colour change when they react with appropriate
substrates. This colour change can be assessed visually or
spectrophotometrically. For the detection of virus, wells in
polystyrene plates are coated with specific antiviral
antibody and test material is added (Fig. 59.3). If present in
the test material, viral antigen binds to the antibody during
incubation and
disnot
t removedby washing
Enzyme-labelled antibody specific for the viral antigen is
then added. Following incubation and washing, substrate
for the enzyme is added; a colour change indicates a
positive reaction.
Large numbers of samples can be processed quickly using
ELISA. Rapid one-step assays suitable for use in
veterinary practices are commercially available. Many of
these kits utilize a membrane as the solid phase in order to
increase the surface area on which antigen-antibody
1430
reactions can occur, thereby reducing incubation and
washing times.
Latex particles,
 coated    with    antiviral  antibodies,
agglutinate in the presence of viral antigen. Special
equipment is not required for these tests, which are simple
and inexpensive. However, factors that decrease the
reliability of these tests include nonspecific reactions and
prozone effects, due to high antigen concentrations.
Immunodiffusion
This procedure is carried out in agar. The technique
involves placing a fluid sample containing the virus under
test in a well in the agar opposite a well containing
antiserum. As the fluids diffuse out of the wells, a line of
precipitate forms if the sample under test contains viral
antigen. Although this test is easy to perform and
inexpensive, it is relatively insensitive.
Complement fixation test for antigen detection
When antigen binds  to antibody to form immune
complexes, complement becomes activated and fixes to the
complexes. In the complement fixation test, the test sample
is   added   to   a
kmown antiserum which has been
heat-inactivated
to
destroycomplement. Following
incubation, a precise amount of guinea-pig complement is
added. If viral antigen is present in the test sample,

Haemagglutination and haemadsorption
Viruses
belonging
several
families
including
to
Orthomyxoviridae,
Paramyxoviridae,
Adenoviridae,
Parvoviridae
 and
Togaviridae
can
interact
with
erythrocytes
of
many
animal
species
causing
haemagglutination. This unique ability derives from viral
glycoproteins (haemagglutinins) which attach to receptors
on erythrocytes, resulting in the formation of aggregates
which settle out of suspension. The haemagglutinins of
orthomyxoviruses
 and
paramyxoviruses
allow these
viruses to bind to neuraminic acid-containing receptors on
erythrocytes. These viruses also possess neuraminidases
which can destroy the erythrocyte receptors, causing
dissociation. The surface structures (spikes) of influenza
viruses which contain haemagglutinin and neuraminidase
activity can be used to type influenza virus A isolates
using specific antibody. As large numbers of virus
1432

haemagglutination, this test is relatively insensitive.
The term haemadsorption is used to describe binding of
erythrocytes  to  cells  infected  with  haemagglutinating
viruses.  The haemagglutinating glycoproteins of these
viruses are incorporated into cell membranes during viral
replication.
Nucleic acid detection
The sensitivity and versatility of methods for the detection
of viral nucleic acids have greatly improved in recent years
and they are now becoming the method of choice for viral
identification. These methods are particularly valuable
when dealing with viruses which are either difficult to
grow or cannot be grown in vitro. They are useful for
        
also for specimens containing inactivated virus. Cloned
viral DNA is available for probing of samples and tissues
by nucleic acid hybridization. An advantage of applying
hybridization procedures to intact cells or tissue sections is
that cellular integrity is retained allowing identification of
the exact site of virus location. Hybridization techniques,
however, have been largely superseded in recent years by
the more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
which has the advantage of amplifying the target gene
sequences. An important modification of PCR is reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which
has extended the application of the technique to RNA
viruses. Because of their exquisite sensitivity, PCR
techniques require rigorous  standardization to exclude
cross-contamination and to ensure reproducibility and
1433
reliability.   When  collecting
 clinical  specimens,
contamination from the environment or from other sources
must be  avoided.  The  possible
presence of   viral
‘passengers’ and degraded viral genomes becomes an
important issue as the sensitivity of detection tests
increases. As manipulation of the amplified product is not
necessary in real time PCR, this method is less prone to
contamination problems than conventional PCR.
Diagnostic serology
Serological procedures can be used for the retrospective
diagnosis  of  viral  diseases  and  for  epidemiological
surveys.  These  procedures can
1be  automated and
diagnostic  reagents for  many  viral 
pathogens are
commercially available. Single blood samples from
animals in susceptible populations suffice for establishing
the prevalence of a disease. When using serological
procedures for the diagnosis of endemic disease in flocks
or herds, paired serum samples taken at an interval of at
least 3 weeks are required to demonstrate rising antibody
titres. Initial samples should be collected during the acute
phase, when clinical signs are first evident, and the second
samples during convalescence. A single blood sample may
be adequate for diagnosis if reagents are available for
demonstrating IgM antibodies, which are indicative of a
primary
immune
 response.
Difficulties with the
interpretation of serological tests may arise due to
cross-reactions with antigenically-related viruses or if the
acute-phase serum is collected too late to detect a primary
immune response. In young animals, passively acquired
maternal antibodies may persist for several months, which
can lead to misinterpretation of results
1434
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
The procedure used for carrying out ELISA to detect
antibodies is different from that previously described for
the demonstration of virus in specimens. The essential
difference is that viral antigen is bound to the solid phase
(polystyrene wells or membranes). Dilutions of test serum
are added and allowed to react with the antigen. After
washing, enzyme-conjugated antiglobulin is added and,
following further incubation and washing, appropriate
substrate is added. The intensity of the colour change is
proportional to the amount of antibody in the test serum
(Fig.  59.4).  Either polyclonal  or monoclonal  labelled
conjugates may be used; the choice depends on whether or
not the immunoglobulin isotype is required for estimating
the duration of the infection.

Immunofluorescence for antibody detection
Using indirect immunofluorescence, test serum is added to
known viral antigen fixed on a microscope slide (Fig
59.5). Following incubation, the slide is washed and, after
the addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
antiglobulin, incubated for a further period. The slide is
again washed before examination using a fluorescence
microscope. The test is both sensitive and rapid, but
requires careful interpretation.
Serum neutralization test
This test is highly specific and sensitive for viruses which
produce cytopathic effects (CPE). It is considered to be the
definitive standard against which other serological tests are
compared.  Neutralizing   antibodies  usually
correlate
closely with immune protection. In this test, which is
typically carried out in microtitre plates, a constant amount
of stock virus is added to doubling dilutions of a test
serum. Cells susceptible to the virus are added to the wells.
The presence of neutralizing antibodies in the serum
prevents infection of the cells and CPE. The titre of the
serum is the highest dilution at which the virus is
1436
neutralized. The neutralizing effect of test serum can also
be evaluated in susceptible experimental animals and in
chick embryos. Neutralizing antibodies tend to persist in
recovered animals for long periods, often for many years.
Haemagglutination inhibition test
Because viruses in certain families have the ability to
haemagglutinate, the inhibitory effect of antibodies on
haemagglutination can be used for the diagnosis of
infection with these viruses. The haemagglutination
inhibition (HAI) test is specific, reliable and easily
performed. The test, usually carried out in microtitre
plates, involves serial twofold dilutions of serum to which
a known concentration (four haemagglutinating units) of
virus is added. The highest dilution of the serum which
inhibits erythrocyte agglutination is the HAI titre of the
test serum. Non-specific inhibitors of haemagglutination,
sometimes present in sera, can be inactivated by heating or
by treatment with kaolin, trypsin, periodate or bacterial
neuraminidase.
Complement fixation tests
Due to difficulties with standardization, complement
fixation tests have been superseded by more convenient
diagnostic tests such as ELISA. Complement-fixing
antibodies tend to appear before neutralizing antibodies but
do not persist. Sera from some species are difficult to
titrate by this method, owing to the presence of
anti-complementary activity.
Western blotting (immunoblotting) technique
1437
This test, which was developed primarily as a research
procedure for the identification of antigenic proteins, can
also be used for the diagnosis of viral disease. Purified
virus, solubilized with an anionic detergent such as sodium
dodecyl sulphate, is electrophoresed
in a polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins are transferred
electrophoretically on to a nitrocellulose membrane, which
is then washed, dried and cut into longitudinal strips
Following incubation in test sera, the strips are washed and
incubated with enzyme-labelled antiglobulin. Addition of
substrate produces an insoluble coloured product where
test antibody is bound to the separated viral proteins.
Interpretation of test results
Because false-positive and false-negative results can occur
in many test procedures, inclusion of positive and negative
controls is essential. The sensitivity and specificity of a
particular diagnostic test should be established. In the case
of a diagnostic test applied to identify infected animals in a
population, the sensitivity of the test, expressed as a
percentage, is the number of animals identified as positive
out of the total number of animals infected. The specificity
of the test is the percentage of uninfected animals in which
the result is negative. In order to detect all animals with an
important viral infection, a test with high sensitivity is
required. For laboratory confirmation of a viral infection in
an individual animal, a test with high specificity is
essential.
The detection of virus or the demonstration of antibody to
a specific virus does not necessarily confirm an
aetiological link with a disease state. With the increasing
1438
use of very sensitive, non-culture-based amplification
methods capable of detecting latent or very low level
persistent
tinfections, care  should
be takenwhen
interpreting results obtained by such sensitive laboratory
methods. For the conclusive confirmation of test results, it
may be necessary to demonstrate a correlation between the
site of virus recovery and the nature and extent of lesions
Circumstantial evidence for the aetiological involvement
of a virus in a clinically affected animal is supported by the
recovery of the same virus from susceptible in-contact
animals. Moreover, a rising antibody titre to the putative
causal virus, demonstrated bv the use of paired serum
samples, is of diagnostic importance. Published reports on
the potential importance of a similar disease syndrome and
its aetiology may point to the requirement for particular
laboratory investigations

Antiviralchemotherapy
Introduction
In common with bacterial infections, some viral infections
may be confined to particular tissues or organs while other
viral infections may become generalized, affecting many
tissues and systems. When feasible, immunization is the
preferred method for controlling viral infections in humans
and animals. However, the absence of vaccines for many
major viral diseases and the emergence of new virulent
virus subtypes in animals, leading to zoonotic infections.
has confirmed the necessity for effective antiviral
chemotherapy not only for treatment of the human
population but also for prophylactic medication of those
exposed to sources of infection. Although antiviral
chemotherapy is now a well established part of human
treatment regimes, its place in veterinary medicine is less
well defined. Cost, the necessity for rapid and reliable
diagnosisbefore
commencing
treatmentandthe
circumstances in which antiviral drugs can be used
therapeutically have curtailed this form of therapy  in
animals. Despite present trends in the use of antiviral drugs
in animals, it is probable that this form of medication will
follow the pattern of antibacterial and anthelmintic use in
animals as cost factors and other circumstances change in
future years.
Unlike bacteria or fungi, viruses
cannot  replicate
independently and, because of this restriction, they are
1440
obligate intracellular parasites. Host cells provide the
requirements for viral replication including energy, protein
synthesis and RNA or DNA replication. Because viruses
utilize the host cell's biosynthetic systems for replication,
development and delivery of antiviral therapy present
many challenges relating to efficacy and toxicity for the
host. Most antiviral drugs have narrow therapeutic margins
and  the efficacy of antiviral  chemotherapy is further
complicated by viral latency, a
featureofmany
herpesviruses.
Virus replication occurs in sequential steps. Attachment
and penetration follow the binding of viral attachment
protein to a cell surface receptor. Once within the cell,
uncoating with release of the viralgenome follows.
Expression of the viral genome, replication of the genome
and   translation    of   viral
1proteins is followedby
post-translational modifications of viral proteins, assembly
of virion components and release by budding or cell lysis.
Effective antiviral drugs inhibit virus-specific events
related to virus replication rather than host cell synthetic
activities, such as nucleic acid or protein synthesis. Most
antiviral drugs interfere with viral-encoded enzymes or
viral structures essential for replication. Many antiviral
drugs are nucleic acid analogues which interfere with
DNA and RNA synthesis. Other mechanisms of action
include interference with viral cell binding, interruption of
virus uncoating and inhibition of virus progeny release
from infected host cells. In addition to their antiviral
activity, some antiviral substances such as interferons
possess immunomodulatory activity. A major obstacle in
1441
the development of antiviral drugs is the inherent toxicity
ofinhibitory
compounds for host cells. The other limiting factor in
antiviral chemotherapy is the development of resistance.
Development of antiviral drugs
Developments in antiviral chemotherapy lagged behind the
sustained progress achieved in antibiotic discoveries from
the 1940s to the 1960s. From the 1970s to the present,
antiviral chemotherapy has progressed steadily in response
to the risks posed by the threat of influenza pandemics, the
rapid spread of human immunodeficiency virus across the
world and the inadequacy of conventional chemotherapy
for the treatment of viral infections in patients with
immunological  incompetence.  Some  of   the   major
developments relating to the synthesis and subsequent use
of antiviral drugs are presented in Fig. 60.1.
Viral infections and  strategies for interrupting virus
replication
All viruses which cause disease in humans and animals
replicate in host cells and, accordingly, they follow a
similar sequence during their replicative cycle. Although
they may share similar features during replication,
diagnosis of viral infections often presents clinicians and
laboratory staff with many challenges. Acute viral
infections  have relatively  short  incubation  periods.
whereas slowly progressing viral infections have long
incubation  periods.  A  consequence of  chronic  viral
infections is the prolonged shedding of virus by the
infected animal. Latent viral infections are characterized
1442
by periodic reactivation of virus replication, often related
to
stressful
environmental
conditions
immunosuppression associated with intercurrent infection,
administration  of  immunosuppressive drugs  or  other
factors. Latency, a feature of some families of viruses such
as herpesviruses, is not affected by treatment with antiviral
drugs. Because currently available antiviral drugs are
virustatic, successful antiviral chemotherapy relies on host
immunological competence. For viral infections such as
those caused by retroviruses, the host's immune response
is unable to clear the viral pathogens from the tissues and
life-long antiviral therapy is required.
Antiviral therapy is aimed at preventing virus entry into
host cells, interfering with uncoating, genome replication
or assembly and release of virus from host cells. Stages of
viral replication and possible points at which antiviral
drugs or components of the immune system can interrupt
replicative events are presented in Table 60.1. The major
modes of action, are reviewed briefly in Table 60.2
Immunomodulators
A number of immunomodulatory drugs which promote
protective immune response to viral pathogens have been
described. Some of these compounds enhance innate
immune responses and, although they lack direct antiviral
effects, they may induce cytokines and chemokines with
antiviral activity. Among the important cytokines with
antiviral activity,   interferons 
feature prominently.
also. They bind to specific cell surface receptors which
1443
initiate  intracellular    events  including  induction   of
particular enzymes, inhibition of cell proliferation and
enhancement of immune responses.
There are two types of functionally overlapping
 s i       s
mediate the early immune responses to viral infections,
include variants of interferon-α (IFN-α) and a single
interferon-β (IFN-β). Mononuclear phagocytes are the
principal source of IFN-α, while fibroblasts and other cells
 (       
produced following antigenic stimulation of T cells and
NK cells.
The primary role of type 1 interferons is defence against
viruses. They induce an antiviral state in most nucleated
cells and also activate NK cells. Interferon-y has indirect
antiviral
activity
but
also
functionsas
an
immunomodulatory cytokine through its ability to activate
macrophages and thereby contribute to the initiation of
specific antiviral resistance mediated by antibodies and T
lymphocytes.
Type 1 interferons are produced by infected cells when
with innate immune responses which detect the presence
of virus by toll-like receptors. Whether produced by
infected cells or sentinel immune cells, type l interferons
act on nearby cells inhibiting virus replication by a number
of mechanisms at different stages of the replicative cycle.
Among the antiviral mechanisms associated with IFN-o
and  IFN-β    are  production   of  a   double-stranded
RNA-dependent protein kinase R, PKR, a latent
1444
endonuclease, RNaseL, and Mx proteins. Release of PKR
interferes with translation of viral mRNA. The RNaseL
degrades viral mRNA and also ribosomal RNA, thereby
inhibiting protein synthesis. The Mx proteins may block
transcription of a range of RNA viruses and also interfere
with virus particle assembly. These proteins, however,
have little effect on DNA viruses. Interferon-y induces
only PKR but, in addition, has a major role in macrophage
activation which results in phagocytosis of viruses and
virus-infected cells, destruction of virus-infected cells and
production of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α ) and IFN
-O.

synthesis and therapeutic use of antiviral drugs from the
1950s onwards. In some instances, many years elapsed

its antiviral activity.

of viral infections in humans and also for use in animals.
Two subtypes of recombinant IFN-α (rIFN-α), rIFN-α-2a
and rIFN-α-2b, have been used for treating viral hepatitis
and other viral diseases. Recently, rIFN-α-2a modified by
covalent attachment  of a branched-chain polyethylene
glycol moiety has become available. This modified
interferon, referred to as pegylated interferon, is absorbed
slowly from the injection site and has a much longer
half-life than conventional interferon.

Ion channel blocking compounds
The anti-influenza drugs amantadine and rimantadine
cycle of influenza A viruses. The mechanism of action of
these antiviral drugs relates to virus uncoating shortly after
endocytosis of virus by the host cell.
Amantadine
The antiviral drug amantadine, which has long been known
as a specific inhibitor of influenza A virus, is a tricyclic
amine. Amantadine inhibits an early step in the replication
of influenza A virus and its antiviral activity is confined to
influenza A virus.
Following attachment to host cell sialic acid moieties on
cell surface glycoproteins by means of influenza envelope
glycoprotein spikes or haemagglutinins, the virus is
endocytosed. At this early stage of its replication cycle, the
virus is contained in a membrane-bound compartment, the
endosome. As part of its normal function, the endosome
becomes acidified. The low pH causes a conformational
change in the virion haemagglutinin protein, and fusion of
the virion envelope and the endosomal membrane occurs,
releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm of the host
1447
cell. However, in the presence of amantadine, the matrix
protein,  Ml，  does
not (
dissociate
from
the
ribonucleoprotein which remains in the cytoplasm instead
of
entering the nucleus.
.The M2 protein in the
nucleocapsid seems to form a polymeric tube-like structure
through which hydrogen ions from the acidified endosome
enter  the  virion  and  dissociate  Mlfrom the
ribonucleoprotein (Fig. 60.2). By interfering with the ion
channel function of the M2 protein, amantadine inhibits
acid-mediated  dissociation    of  the   ribonucleoprotein
complex early in replication, a process essential for
uncoating of the single-stranded RNA genome
Primary drug resistance to amantadine is uncommon in
human isolates of influenza A virus. Resistance in some
    s   
nucleotide changes leading to amino acid substitutions in
the transmembrane region of M2 protein have been
associated with resistance to amantadine.

Rimantadine
Like amantadine, rimantadine is a specific inhibitor of
influenza A virus. Both drugs can be used for the treatment
and prevention
of mfection.
Rimantadine, an α-methy]
derivative of amantadine, is a tricyclic amine with much
greater antiviral activity than amantadine. In addition to its
antiviral activity, rimantadine has inhibitory activity
1n
vitro for Trypanosoma brucei.
As described for amantadine, the mechanism of action of
rimantadine relates to interference with virus uncoating
1450
shortly after endocytosis. The functioning of the M2
protein in the nucleocapsid of the virus, which is
associated with uncoating, is disrupted by rimantadine.
When this occurs, acid-mediated dissociation of the
ribonucleoprotein complex, a process essential for
uncoating of the single-stranded RNA genome, does not
take place.
Primary drug resistance to rimantadine in human isolates
of influenza A virus is uncommon. Resistance in some
avian and swine isolates has been reported. Alteration of
M2 protein or haemagglutinin protein may contribute to
the   development
of resistance.

amantadine share cross-susceptibility   and resistance
patterns.Resistance may

Neuraminidase inhibitors
Inhibitors of influenza neuraminidase activity interfere
with release of influenza A virus and influenza B virus
from host cells. When influenza viruses complete their
replicative cycle, they bud from the cell membrane.
Release of newly formed virions from infected cells
requires neuraminidase for cleavage of sialic acid residues
from the cell membrane envelope present on the budding
virions. If this does not take place, the binding of
haemagglutinin protruding from the virion surface with
persisting sialic acid residues on newly released adjacent
virions causes aggregation of the virions on the cell
surface.
1451
The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir
are  sialic acid analogues  which  specifically  inhibit
influenza A virus and influenza B virus neuraminidase
activity (Fig. 60.2).
Oseltamivir
Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated that
neuraminidase activity at the time of virion release is
shown that oseltamivir and zanamivir, both neuraminidase
inhibitors, were effective antiinfluenza drugs when used
prophylactically and also therapeutically
Oseltamivir is a transition-state analogue of sialic acid
which is a potent selective inhibitor of influenza A and B
neuraminidase activity. The interaction of oseltamivir with
neuraminidase causes  a  conformational  change  in  the
enzyme's active site which inhibits its activity. As a
consequence of neuraminidase inhibition, aggregation and
clumping of virions occur at the infected cell surface.
reducing the spread of virus within the respiratory tract.
Although influenza variants containing haemagglutinin
and neuraminidase mutations which are less inhibited by
oseltamivir than wild-type viruses have been reported,
such isolates have reduced infectivity and virulence in
animal models.
Zanamivir
The neuraminidase inhibitor, zanamivir, like oseltamivir, is
a sialic acid analogue which specifically inhibits influenza
1452
A virus and influenza B virus neuraminidase activity.
Unlike oseltamivir, zanamivir is not bio-available if
administered orally and it is given as a dry powder by
intranasal inhalation or by oral inhalation in humans.
Neuraminidase    inhibition   by    zanamivir    results

Many antiviral  drugs inhibit  viral genome replication
Most of these drugs are nucleoside analogues which inhibit
viral polymerases, especially DNA polymerases. Before
these compounds can exert their antiviral effect, they must
undergo intracellular phosphorylation to the active
triphosphate form. Phosphorylated nucleoside analogues
inhibit polymerases by competing with natural substrates
and they are usually incorporated into the growing DNA
chain where they often terminate elongation.
Acyclovir and related drugs in this category, which include
famciclovir, penciclovir, ganciclovir and valacyclovir, are
all acyclic nucleoside analogues. These antiviral drugs,
which are especially effective against herpesviruses,
inhibit  viral  DNA polymerase  or  inhibit  viral  DNA
synthesis by  slowing and eventually terminating  chain
elongation (Fig. 60.3).
1453
Acyclovir
The nucleoside analogue acyclovir is structurally similar to
the natural nucleoside deoxyguanosine (Fig. 60.4). This
acyclic guanosine nucleoside was among the first antiviral
drugs approved for clinical use in humans and its antiviral
activity is restricted to herpesviruses.  Acyclovir has
selective activity against a number of herpesviruses
including herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses.
There is limited published information on the clinical
efficacy of acyclovir for the treatment of herpesvirus
infections in animals.
Acyclovir inhibits DNA polymerase in a number of
herpesviruses. Before this antiviral drug can exert its
effect, however, it must be phosphorylated. Herpes
simplex virus encodes a thymidine kinase which activates
the drug by phosphorylation to acyclovir monophosphate,
and host cell enzymes complete the conversion to the
diphosphate form and finally to the triphosphate form
Because initial phosphorylation does not take place in
uninfected cells, the production of acyclovir triphosphate
is   confined    to 
0 herpesvirus-infected cells. Acyclovir
triphosphate competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerases
and, to a lesser extent, cellular DNA polymerases. The
acyclovir triphosphate also becomes incorporated into viral
DNA where it acts as a chain terminator. A feature of
herpesvirus infections in humans and animals is latency,
which is associated  with periodic symptomatic and
asymptomatic recurrence. Antiviral drugs do not eliminate
latent viral infections.

Acyclovir
Treatment with acyclovir has been reported to decrease
mortality in parakeets and psittacine birds with herpesvirus
infections. This antiviral drug is also used for treating
feline viral rhinotracheitis.
Resistance to acyclovir is linked to absence or partial
productionof
thymidine  kinase,  altered   thymidine
substrate specificity or alteration of viral DNA polymerase
 in a manner which prevents acyclovir binding.
Cidofovir
The cytidine nucleotide analogue cidofovir has inhibitory
activity
against
herpesviruses,
poxviruses,
papillomaviruses and adenoviruses. Cidofovir has a long
tissue half-life and in many animal models long intervals
between doses do not diminish its antiviral activity. Single
doses may be effective against poxvirus infections.
1456
Cidofovir inhibits viral DNA synthesis by slowing and
gradually terminating chain elongation. Resistance to
cidofovir is attributed to mutations in viral DNA
polymerase.
Famciclovir and penciclovir
A prodrug
 derivative of penciclovir, famciclovir is
metabolized to the active compound, penciclovir in vivo.
Famciclovir  is  a diacetyl ester of 6-deoxypenciclovir.
Penciclovir is an acyclic guanine nucleoside analogue and
its mode of action and spectrum of activity are similar to
those of acyclovir. This antiviral drug is an inhibitor of
viral DNA synthesis, and penciclovir triphosphate acts as a
competitive    inhibitor    of   viral   DNA    polymerase.
Penciclovir, which inhibits herpesviruses in a manner
similar to acyclovir, becomes concentrated in and persists
in infected cells to a greater extent than acyclovir.
Resistance
e topenciclovir andfamcicloviramong
herpesviruses develops in the same manner as observed
with acyclovir. However, resistance during clinical use is
reported to be low.
Foscarnet
The antiviral drug foscarnet is an inorganic pyrophosphate
analogue which inhibits viral DNA polymerase by binding
directly to the pyrophosphate binding site. Foscarnet,
trisodium phosphonoformate,  inhibits replication  of
herpesvirus    DNA   polymerases  and   HIV  reverse
transcriptase. Its clinical use, however, is limited to
herpesvirus infections.
1457
Foscarnet reversibly blocks the pyrophosphate binding site
inhibits cleavage of pyrophosphate from deoxynucleoside
triphosphates.
Although
foscarnet
　 inhibits  DNA
polymerase by a mechanism that differs from nucleoside
analogues, many mutant viruses which are resistant to
nucleoside analogues are also resistant to foscarnet.
Herpesvirus resistance to foscarnet is associated with point
mutations in the gene encoding viral DNA polymerase.
Ganciclovir
The acyclic guanine nucleoside analogue, ganciclovir, is
similar in structure to acyclovir. Ganciclovir has inhibitory
activity against many herpesviruses but it is especially
active
against cytomegalovirus.
Phosphorylationof
ganciclovir within herpes-infected cells is initiated by viral
kinases.  Ganciclovir
diphosphate
and
ganciclovir
triphosphate are
eformed by cellular enzymes.The
triphosphate  form
1is  a competitive inhibitor
of
deoxyguanosine triphosphate incorporation into DNA and
it preferentially interferes with viral DNA polymerase
rather than the DNA polymerase of host cells.
Incorporation of ganciclovir triphosphate into viral DNA
does not result in chain termination as is the case with
acyclovir triphosphate incorporation. When ganciclovir
triphosphate is incorporated into host cells, it exerts a
radiomimetic effect, especially on bone marrow cells.
Resistance to ganciclovir results from reduced intracellular
phosphorylation and mutations in viral DNA polymerase.
Idoxuridine
1458
The iodinated thymidine analogue, idoxuridine, was
among  the  first  specific 
 antiviral
compounds used
therapeutically. Its antiviral activity does not compare with
the high  selectivity  of moderm antiviral  compounds.
Idoxuridine inhibits the replication of a number of DNA
viruses including
gherpesviruses and poxviruses.It
resembles acyclovir in its mode of action as it is first
converted to a monophosphate nucleotide by viral
thymidine kinase with subsequent synthesis of diphosphate
and    triphosphate   nucleosides
bycellular  kinases.
Idoxuridine triphosphate inhibits viral and cellular DNA
synthesis. Much of its antiviral activity is attributed to its
incorporation  into  viral nucleic acid  with  subsequent
interference with viral gene expression. Because of its
toxicity following systemic administration, it is used only
as a topical  agent.  Ophthalmic  solutions  containing
idoxuridine are used for treating herpesvirus keratitis in
animals.
Resistance to idoxuridine, which develops quickly, is due
to mechanisms similar to those that mediate resistance to
acyclovir. These  include altered  thymidine substrate
specificity and alteration  of viral  DNA polymerase
resulting in interference with idoxuridine binding.
Ribavirin
This antiviral drug inhibits the replication of a wide range
of DNA and RNA viruses. Ribavirin, a purine nucleoside
analogue, is phosphorylated successively by cellular
kinases to ribavirin-monophosphate, ribavirin-diphosphate
and ribavirin-triphosphate nucleotides. The triphosphate
form inhibits the RNA polymerase of the influenza viruses,
1459
and other mechanisms of antiviral activity probably
operate in the inhibition of a range of RNA and DNA
viruses. The mode of action of ribavirin is probably
relatively non-specific (Fig. 60.2).
Ribavirin, administered as an aerosol, is used to treat
severe respiratory syncytial virus bronchopneumonia in
children. Oral ribavirin, combined with pegylated
interferon-a-2a, is active against hepatitis C virus infection.
Prompt administration of ribavirin to patients with Lassa
fever caused by an arenavirus results in a dramatic
reduction in mortality. Ribavirin is active against feline
infectious peritonitis virus in vitro but, when used to treat
cats experimentally infected with calicivirus, it induced
bone marrow suppression and other adverse reactions.
The relatively broad antiviral spectrum of ribavirin is often
accompanied by an associated lack of potency at non-toxic
levels. Lack of specificity of an antiviral drug often
correlates with limited clinical activity and this applies to
ribavirin also. Undesirable effects of ribavirin therapy
include bone marrow suppression and oxidative damage to
membranes
Emergence of resistance to ribavirin has been recorded
infrequently. Because of the uncertainty associated with its
mode of action, the underlying mechanisms leading to the
development of resistance are not well defined.
Trifluridine
This fluorinated analogue of thymidine has in vitro
inhibitory activity against a wide range of viruses
1460
including herpesviruses, vaccinia  virus and some
adenoviruses. Trifluridine is highly toxic and unsuitable
for systemic use. The triphosphate form of trifluridine is a
competitive inhibitor of the incorporation of thymidine
triphosphate into DNA. This antiviral compound, which
was synthesized more than 40 years ago, is still the
treatment of choice for herpesvirus keratoconjunctivitis in
humans. It is used as a 1% ophthalmic solution. If given
systemically, trifluridine is reported to be mutagenic and
teratogenic in animals. It is used topically for the treatment
of herpetic keratitis in animals.
Resistance to trifluridine has been described in clinical
isolates of herpesviruses. The basis of resistance is
attributed to altered thymidine kinase substrate specificity
Valacyclovir
The L-valyl ester of acyclovir, valacyclovir, is efficiently
absorbed after oral administration and rapidly converted to
acyclovir. The enhanced oral bioavailability of acyclovir
produced from valacyclovir has allowed the development
of better treatment regimes than with acyclovir
Valacyclovir inhibits viral DNA synthesis by the same
mechanisms outlined for acyclovir.  In common with
acyclovir, valacyclovir has inhibitory activity against
herpesviruses and is reported to be especially effective
against herpes zoster infections in humans.
Antiretroviral drugs
Antiretroviral fusion inhibitors
1461
Antiviral drugs which interfere with virus attachment and
entry into host cells prevent subsequent stages of virus
infection. Such drugs also provide an opportunity for
components of the immune system to clear viruses from
body fluids and host tissues.
Enfuvirtide
The synthetic peptide enfuvirtide prevents the fusion of
HIV-1 with the host cell outer membrane, thereby
preventing infection of CD4+ T cells. The sequence of the
        s
transmembrane gp41 region of HIV-1 which mediates
fusion of the virus membrane lipid bilayer with that of the
host cell. Enfuvirtide inhibits infection of CD4+ T cells by
free virus particles and also prevents cell-to-cell
transmission of HIV-1 in vitro (Fig. 60.5). Because of its
unique mechanism of action, enfuvirtide retains activity
against viruses which have become resistant to other
classes of antiretroviral drugs. Human immunodeficiency
type 1 strains develop resistance to enfuvirtide through
specific mutations in the enfuvirtide-binding domain of
gp41.

Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors

to a site on the

 activity. Delaviridine and
nevirapine, two examples
S of these antiviral drugs, are
1463
non-competitive inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.
These drugs do not require intracellular phosphorylation to
acquire antiviral activity.
Delaviridine
The non-nucleoside
reverse
  transcriptase inhibitor
delaviridine is a bis-heteroarylpiperazine compound which
selectively inhibits HIV-1. Delaviridine induces a
conformational change in reverse transcriptase which
disrupts its catalytic activity. Because the target site of this
antiviral drug is HIV-1 -specific and is non-essential for the
enzyme, resistance can develop quickly. If resistance to
delaviridine develops, cross-resistance to other antiviral
drugs in this class usually follows.
Nevirapine
In common with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors, nevirapine binds to sites on the enzyme
different  from  the  substrate. Nevirapine isa
dipyridodiazepinone compound which selectively inhibits
HIV-lbut not HIV-2.This antiviraldrug isa
non-competitive inhibitor which binds to a site on HIV- 1
reverse transcriptase that is distant from the active site,
inducing a conformational change in the enzyme which
disrupts its catalytic activity. Because the target site is
HIV-specific and is not essential for the functioning of the
enzyme, resistance to nevirapine develops rapidly. If
resistance to nevirapine occurs, cross- resistance to other
antiviral drugs in this class usually follows.
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
1464
A number of nucleoside analogues, including lamivudine,
stavudine and zidovudine, are inhibitors of HIV reverse
transcriptase. Stavudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue
and lamivudine is a cytosine analogue.
These nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are
activated intracellularly by phosphorylation with cellular
kinases, and their triphosphate forms competitively inhibit
reverse transcriptase. The triphosphate form of these
antiviral agents terminates elongation of the proviral DNA
chain (Fig. 60.5).
Lamivudine
The cytosine
  analogue lamivudine  is  a reverse
transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and HIV-2 and an
inhibitor of the DNA polymerase of hepatitis B virus.
Cellular enzymes convert lamivudine to the triphosphate
form which competitively inhibits hepatitis B DNA
polymerase.
Resistance to lamivudine, which occurs with single amino
acid substitutions, develops rapidly in patients with HIV
infections treated with this drug alone. Such resistance
confers cross-resistance to related antiviral drugs. In
combination with zidovudine, lamivudine has a marked
synergistic antiviral effect.
Stavudine
Nucleoside inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase act as
DNA chain terminators after they are converted to the
triphosphate form intracellularly. Stavudine, a synthetic
1465
nucleoside analogue, is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor
which is active against HIV-1 and HIV-2. The triphosphate
form of stavudine terminates the elongation of proviral
DNA and, accordingly, HIV replication.
Resistance to stavudine shares common features with
resistance to another thymidine analogue, zidovudine.
Mutations that lead to resistance to these two antiviral
drugs are referred to as thymidine-associated mutations.
Resistance mechanisms relate to mutations in reverse
transcriptase.
Zidovudine
Nucleoside
reverse
etranscriptase inhibitorsinclude
zidovudine, an analogue of thymidine. Zidovudine was the
infection. It has inhibitory activity against a range of
retroviruses including HIV-1, HIV-2, human T cell
lymphotropic viruses and other mammalian viruses.
Because it becomes incorporated by the enzymatic activity
of reverse transcriptase into nascent DNA, zidovudine
triphosphate terminates the elongation of the proviral DNA
chain (Fig. 60.5). Selectivity does not exist at the
activation  step  and,  a
 accordingly,  phosphorylated
zidovudine accumulates in most dividing cells. This leads
to toxicity which is characterized by bone marrow
suppression resulting in neutropenia and anaemia.
Treatment with zidovudine was reported to reduce clinical
cats. Although infection persists despite
1466
treatment, therapy with this antiviral drug may prolong the
lives of infected cats.
Resistance to zidovudine is associated with mutations in
viral reverse transcriptase resulting in decreased affinity of
the enzyme for this antiviral drug. Cross-resistance to other
thymidine analogues also occurs.
Antiviral drugs which act as protease inhibitors
Together with genome replication, production of virus
proteins is an essential part of the replicative cycle of all
viruses. For many viruses, including HIV-1, assembly of
proteins and nucleic acid into viral particles does not
produce an infectious virion. An additional step, referred
to as maturation, is required. New virus proteins require
cleavage by virus- specific proteases to become fully
functional. The HIV-1 protease cleaves gag and pol
polyproteins yielding shorter mature HIV proteins. The
gagproteinsconstitute
  essential  structural   proteins
including nucleocapsid proteins, whereas the pol proteins
possess enzymatic activity including reverse transcriptase,
protease and integrase functions. Thus, HIV protease has a
central role in converting HIV virus particles into mature
infectious viruses. Cleavage events are initiated when
newly formed virions begin to bud from an infected cell.
Inhibition of  protease results  in  the production  of
non-infectious  viruses.  HIV protease inhibitors  are
peptide-like chemicals which competitively inhibit the
activity of the viral protease. When combined with
long-term suppression of viraemia, increased CD4+ T
lymphocyte numbers and reduced disease progression.
1467
Antiviral drugs which  target HIV protease include
amprenavir, ritonavir and saquinavir. When introduced
into an infected cell before virion budding commences,
protease inhibitors prevent polyprotein cleavage and result
in the production of non-infectious virus.
Amprenavir
Amprenavir is an amino sulphonamide non-peptide HIV
protease inhibitor. This antiviral drug acts by binding to
the active site of HIV protease, preventing the processing
of gag and pol polyprotein precursors and, as a
consequence of this interference, immature non-infectious
virus particles are produced (Fig. 60.5).
As amprenavir is an active-site inhibitor of HIV protease,
resistance to this drug is conferred by mutations in the
viral protease cleavage site and amino acid substitutions. It
has been reported that cleavage site mutations can improve
the fitness of protease mutants.
Ritonavir
Protease inhibitors share a number of characteristics: they
bind competitively to proteases of HIV-l and HIV-2,
preventing  the post-translational breakdown of viral
polyprotein into shorter, mature proteins required for
assembly of the virion and for budding, without the need
for intracellular activation of proteases.
Ritonavir is a peptidomimetic HIV protease inhibitor
which reversibly binds to the active site of HIV protease,
thereby preventing polypeptide processing. Infected cells
1468
exposed to ritonavir continue to produce viral proteins but
these proteins are unsuitable for virion assembly and for
maturation. Although virus particles are produced in the
presence of ritonavir, they are not infectious.
Resistance to ritonavir develops because of accumulation
of mutations in the corresponding gene leading to amino
acid substitutions at active enzymatic sites or at other sites
known to interact with inhibitors. Viruses with protease
mutations, however, appear to be less fit than wild-type
viruses.
Saquinavir
As the first licensed virus protease inhibitor, saquinavir
         
clinical trials, however, it had poor oral bioavailablity.
Saquinavir is a peptidomimetic hydroxyethylamine HIV
protease inhibitor which inhibits replication of HIV-1 and
HIV-2. It reversibly binds to the active site of HIV
protease, preventing polypeptide processing and virion
maturation.
Resistance to saquinavir develops because of accumulation
of mutations with amino acid substitutions at the active
site.
Resistance to antiviral drugs
All forms of microorganisms, including viruses, can
readily become resistant to inhibitory drugs. As most
antiviral compounds are highly selective and usually target
a specific viral protein, often enzymes involved in viral
1469
nucleic acid synthesis or viral protein processing, a natural
consequence is that point mutations in the virus genome
can result in drug-resistant variants. The development of
resistance, which often limits the usefulness of antiviral
drugs, has been reported for the majority of antiviral
compounds currently in use. As current antiviral drugs
inhibit active replication, viral replication is likely to
resume when treatment concludes. Effective antiviral host
immune responses are therefore essential for clinical
recovery from infection. Failure of antiviral therapy may
relate to the host's
immunologicali
incompetence  or  the  emergence  of
drug-resistant variants. Development of resistance, a
multifactorial process, may involve the selection and use
of the antiviral compounds, drug concentration at the site
of infection, initial virus susceptibility to the treatment,
inherent characteristics of the invading virus and the
immune status of the host.
Factors which affect the development of drug resistance
The frequency of drug-resistant mutants in a population of
viruses and the rate at which mutations arise depend on
       
rate of the virus: the higher the rate of mutation, the more
rapidly  resistance develops.  Viral mutation rates are
mostly determined by the fidelity of the polymerases
which replicate the viral genome. Among DNA viruses,
there is a relatively low error rate because DNA
polymerases include exonuclease proofreading functions
which can eliminate errors. In contrast, RNA viruses have
very high intrinsic mutation rates with no proofreading or
repair mechanisms involved. This high rate of mutation
1470
combined with a large virion population can give rise
quickly to considerable diversity within a single host.
Based on virus mutation rates alone, viruses could evolve
to resist any antiviral drug unless the drug in question
succeeded in reducing virus replication to a negligible
level.  This can be achieved
1inpractice bydrug
combinations aimed at reducing virus replication to a low
level.
Although  some antiviral  drugs  are potential  chemical
mutagens, most mutants appear to arise naturally and these
virions have a selective advantage in the presence of the
inhibitor. Drug therapy, therefore, does not induce the
mutation; rather it provides the necessary selective
pressure for the promotion of drug-resistant viruses which
arise naturally.
Another aspect of antiviral drug resistance is the target size
for mutation: the greater the number of sites where
mutations confer drug resistance, the more rapidly antiviral
resistance is likely to occur. Mutations which give rise to
amino acid substitutions in or close to the site which
interacts with the inhibitory compound, leading to
resistance, are referred to as primary mutations. Such
mutations usually arise early after exposure to the antiviral
compound. Additional mutations which arise during the
course of treatment and which contribute to the overall
level of resistance are termed secondary mutations. Even
in the absence of antiviral chemotherapy, a small number
of virions in a given population become resistant to
inhibitory drugs. Such pre-existing drug-resistant mutants
continue to replicate when selective pressure is applied
through administration of antiviral drugs.
1471
Some drug-resistant mutants have altered pathogenicity, a
consequence of alteration of virus fitness. For a virus
which is drug-resistant to be capable of causing disease, it
must mutate not only to evade drug inhibition but also to
retain those characteristics required for disease production
Apartfrom
 immunomodulatory  compounds
which
promote either non-specific or specific protective antiviral
immune responses, development of resistance to antiviral
drugs  is  an
 inevitable 
consequenceofantiviral
chemotherapy. Of the many strategies that can be applied
to the control of viral diseases in humans and animals.
vaccination is the preferred option. In the absence of
effective vaccination, antiviral chemotherapy offers the
possibility of prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for a
defined number of viral pathogens.
Future developments
For the past two decades, the choice of antiviral
       
compounds with activity against herpesviruses, some
influenza viruses and retroviruses. In recent years,
molecular developments have ushered in a new era which
heralds fundamental changes in the choice, safety and cost
of antiviral compounds. The ability of pharmaceutical
companies  to  synthesize  antiviral  drugs  with  greater
specificity than those currently in clinical use offers the
possibility of less toxic, more effective compounds for a
wider range of viral pathogens than has been available in
recent years.
1472
Because symptoms of acute infection often occur after
viral replication has been taking place for several days, the
benefit of chemotherapy for viral infections is often less
evident than for bacterial infections. Successful antiviral
immunological  competence.  As  the   antiviral   drugs
currently available are virustatic, the outcome of viral
infection is ultimately determined by components of innate
immune responses, especially interferons and NK cells,
and by specific cellmediated immune responses together
with the production of neutralizing antibodies or antibodies
that contribute to the development of antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
Future antiviral therapeutic developments will depend on
the identification of new molecular targets during viral
replication  and   the  synthesis  of appropriate  antiviral
agents. A new target for the inhibition of herpes simplex
virus, the helicase-primase complex,
has
 been reported.
.The helicase-primase complex
comprises a group of three proteins concermed with
unwinding the double-stranded DNA and priming the
daughter
r  strand
　during DNA
replication.An
aminothiazolylphenyl-containing compound, BILS 179
BS, was reported to inhibit the enzymatic activities of
herpes simplex virus helicase-primase (Crute et al., 2002).
The mechanism of action of these types of inhibitors is
through the stabilization of the enzyme-nucleic acid
interactionswhich
  prevent   progression through
helicase-primase catalytic cycles. Both in vitro and in vivo
anti-herpes simplex virus activity was demonstrated with
this    antiviral 
compound.   Another   helicase-primase
inhibitor belonging to the thiazolyl-amides, BAY 57-1293,

with marked anti-herpes simplex activity, has been
reported to bind to the helicase- primase subunits
simultaneously (Kleymann et al, 2002). This antiviral
compound had potent therapeutic antiviral activity in mice
experimentally infected with herpes simplex virus type 1
(Biswas et al., 2007). This compound was also effective in
athymic nude mice, animals which have defective
cell-mediated immune responses.
Helicase inhibitors, which are aminothiazole derivatives,
appear to be highly potent in tissue culture and in animal
models.
Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are not currently available
for  clinical use. A phosphorothioate oligonucleotide,
referred to as REP-9, is reported to have antiviral activity
against a range of enveloped viruses (Field and Vere
Hodge, 2008). This oligonucleotide, which has both
hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, is reported to be
active
 against
herpesviruses,  orthomyxoviruses,
paramyxoviruses and retroviruses. The antiviral effects of
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been demonstrated
in vitro for a range of viruses which affect humans and
animals but the application of this approach using in vivo
test systems has been limited owing to the technical
difficulties of delivering sufficient amounts of siRNAs
intracellularly.

Herpesviridae
The family Herpesviridae contains more than 1o0 viruses.
Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals including
humans are susceptible to herpesvirus infection. These
viruses are of special
importance
because of their
widespread occurrence, their evolutionary diversity and
their involvement in many important diseases of domestic
animals and humans.
The name, herpesvirus (Greek
herpein, to creep), refers to the sequential appearance and
local extension of lesions in human infection. Herpesvirus
virions are enveloped and range from 200 nm to 250 nm in
diameter. They contain double-stranded DNA within an
icosahedral capsid which has a diameter of 125 nm (Fig.
61.1). A layer of amorphous material, the tegument, lies
between the envelope and the capsid. Herpesviruses enter
cells by fusing with the plasma membrane. Replication
occurs in the cell nucleus. The method by which mature
        
currently a matter of debate. Nucleocapsids appear to bud
through the inner nuclear membrane. However, it is
unclear whether this envelope is retained or if fusion with
the outer nuclear membrane causes the envelope to be lost
with subsequent re-envelopment occurring in a Golgi or
post-Golgi compartment.
.At least ten viral encoded
glycoproteins  are
incorporated into  theenvelope
Enveloped virions are released from the cell by exocytosis
Infection involving virus replication results in cell death.
However, herpesviruses are best known for their ability to
produce latent infections. The mechanisms controlling
1479
latency are not well understood but are thought to involve
a ‘default’ mechanism whereby immediate early gene
expression fails to occur, resulting in the maintenance of
the viral genome as a circular episomal element.
.A
possible trigger for alphaherpesvirus latency may be
infection of neurons, which are only partly permissive.
Resumption of the productive cycle of infection is
dependent on changes in the infected cell due to external
stimuli or cell differentiation. Intranuclear inclusions are
characteristic of herpesvirus infections. Extension of viral
infection occurs through points of cell contact without
exposure of virus to neutralizing antibodies in blood or
interstitial fluids. Protective antibody responses are usually
directed against the envelope glycoproteins. Herpes-virus

Betaherpesviruses, which replicate and spread slowly,
cause infected cells to enlarge, hence their common name

Clinical infections
Herpesviruses establish life-long infections with periodic
reactivation resulting in bouts of clinical disease. Shedding
of virus may be periodic or continuous. Following a
cell-associated viraemia, systemic infection is usual.
Members of the genus Simplexvirus, however, tend to
       
epithelium at the site of inoculation and the sensory nerves
that innervate the site. During latency, the episomal viral
genome remains circular and gene expression is limited.
Reactivation of infection is associated with various stress
factors
including
 transportation,
adverse
weather
conditions, overcrowding and
intercurrent infection.
Natural infections with particular herpesviruses are usually
restricted to defined host species. Because these viruses are
highly adapted to their natural hosts, infections may be
inapparent or mild. However, in very young or
immunosuppressed animals, or as a result of infection of
1482
an alternative host, infection can be life-threatening. Some
herpesviruses, such as Marek's disease virus and human
herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus), are implicated in
neoplastic transformation of cells
Herpesviruses can cause respiratory, genital, mammary
and CNS diseases in cattle (Tables 61.1, 61.2). Aujeszky's
disease, which affects pigs and other domestic species, is
the major porcine herpesvirus infection (Table 61.3). In
horses, herpesviruses can cause respiratory, neurological
and venereal diseases, and abortion along with neonatal
infection (Table 61.4). The herpesviruses of domestic
carnivores are presented in Table 61.5 and those of birds in

Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), which infects domestic
and range cattle, is associated with several clinical
conditions including
 infectious bovine rhinotracheitis,
infectious
pustular
vulvovaginitis,
balanoposthitis.
conjunctivitis and respiratory disease in calves. Infection
with BHV-1 is an important cause of losses in livestock
worldwide. A single antigenic type of BHV-1, which
contains subtypes 1.1, 1.2a and 1.2b, has been recognized
using restriction enzyme analysis (Table 61.2)
Epidemiology
Transmission occurs via respiratory or genital secretions.
Aerosol transmission is most efficient over short distances
1486
and is facilitated by the close grouping of animals. The
reactivation of latent infections may occur following
stressful events such as transportation or parturition. Virus
is transported intra-axonally to the original portal of entry.
These animals frequently show no clinical signs when the
infection is reactivated but shed virus into the environment
and are an important means of perpetuating infection in
herds. The semen of infected bulls may contain virus and
infection may follow natural  service or artificial
insemination. In addition, aborted foetuses can be an
important source of infection.
Pathogenesis and pathology
The virus that causes infectious bovine rhinotracheitis is
usually acquired through aerosols. Replication occurs in
 n As sddn ar jo saq snon a
large amounts of virus are shed in nasal secretions. Virus
also enters local nerve cell endings and is transported
intra-axonally to the trigeminal ganglion where it remains
latent. It is also thought that latent infection can become
established in the germinal centres of the pharyngeal
tonsils. In most instances, infection is contained within 2
weeks by a strong immune response. However, tissue
severe systemic effects and, possibly, death. Rarely,
viraemia in pregnant cows may produce foetal infection
and abortion. Necrotic foci may be present in various
organs of aborted foetuses, particularly in the liver.
Following genital infection with subtypes 1.2a and 1.2b,
virus replicates in the mucosa of the vagina or prepuce,
and latent infection may become established in the sacral
1487
ganglia. Focal necrotic lesions on genital mucosae may
eventually coalesce to form large ulcers. An intense
inflammatory reaction can develop in the reproductive
tract  with  secondary bacterial  infection leading  to
endometritis. Viraemia is not a feature of genital infection
with BHV-1 subtypes and infected pregnant cows rarely
abort.
Clinical signs
In outbreaks of disease, either the respiratory or the genital
form usually predominates. The incubation
period is up to 6 days. The severity of the clinical signs in
the respiratory form of the disease are largely determined
by the extent of secondary bacterial infection. Affected
animals develop a high temperature and nasal discharge
accompanied by anorexia. The nares are inflamed ('red
nose') and conjunctivitis, lacrimal discharge and corneal
opacity are often present. In uncomplicated infections,
animals recover after about a week. If bacterial infection
becomes established, animals develop dyspnoea, coughing
and open-mouth breathing. Death may ensue. In severe
outbreaks in feedlot cattle, morbidity may approach 100%
and mortality may be as high as 10%.
Cows with infectious pustular vulvovaginitis exhibit
vaginal discharge and frequent urination. Animals usually
recover within 2 weeks. However, secondary bacterial
infection may result in metritis, temporary infertility and
purulent vaginal discharge persisting for several weeks
Infected bulls have lesions on penile and preputial
mucosae.
1488
Afatal generalized disease with fever, oculonasal
discharge, respiratory distress, diarrhoea, incoordination
and convulsions has been described in young calves.
Diagnosis
·Swabs collected from the eyes, nares and genitalia of several
affected animals during the early acute phase of the disease
are suitable for virus isolation (Nettleton et al, 1983)
Because the virus is fragile, specimens for transportation to
the laboratory should be placed in viral transport medium
and kept refrigerated. The virus produces a rapid cytopathic
effect in bovine cell lines.
· Smears from ocular, nasal or genital swabs and frozen
sections of tissues from aborted foetuses can be used for the
rapid   demonstration
of
viral
antigen
by
immunofluorescence. Viral antigen can also be detected
using ELISA.
· The presence of characteristic gross and microscopic lesions
in aborted foetuses is suggestive of infection with BHV-1.
·The polymerase chain reaction has been adapted for
detection of BHV-1 DNA in appropriate samples (Moore et
al.,2000)
·Real-time PCR assays are now widely used instead of virus
isolation for detection of virus (Kramps, 2008).
· Evidence of a rising antibody titre in paired serum samples
using virus neutralization or ELISA is indicative of active
infection. Commercial ELISA kits are available including
gE-ELISA formats designed for use in conjunction with
marker vaccines.
· As part of a surveillance programme, bulk milk samples can
be tested for antibodies using ELISA.
Control
Inactivated, subunit and modified live vaccines are
available for the control of BHV-l (van Oirschot et al.,
1489
1996). Vaccination reduces the severity of clinical signs
but may not prevent infection and the establishment of
latent infection with possible future re-excretion. Regular
re-vaccination at 6-monthly intervals can help to decrease
the risk of re-excretion. Modified-live vaccines, which
may cause abortion, should not be administered to
pregnant   animals.  Vaccine  strains,  which 
Iare
temperature-sensitive, have a cut-off temperature in the
same range as body temperature and should be
administered by the intranasal route. Replication of these
mutants in nasal mucosa is not impaired as the temperature
at this site is lower than that of the body. Marker or DIVA
(differentiate infected from vaccinated animals) vaccines,
based either on genetically engineered viruses lacking one
or on  subunit
t preparations containing one or more
glycoproteins, are available. A serological test, usually a
blocking ELISA, is used to detect antibodies against a
glycoprotein not present in the marker vaccine. The
availability of marker vaccines enables either eradication
or reduction of infection in national herds to proceed
economically. Successful eradication programmes based
on test and slaughter policies have been carried out in
Denmark and Switzerland.
Bovine herpes mammillitis and pseudo-lumpy-skin disease
Infection with bovine herpesvirus 2 (BHV-2) is associated
with outbreaks of a severe ulcerative condition of the teats
of dairy cows. The condition has been reported in many
countries around the world. Bovine herpesvirus 2 infection
resulting in a generalized mild skin infection, termed
pseudo-lumpy-skin disease to distinguish it from the more
1490
serious lumpy skin disease caused by a poxvirus, has been
reported in tropical and subtropical regions. Isolates of the
virus appear to be serologically and genetically similar
regardless of whether they have come from cases of
mammillitis or pseudo-lumpy-skin disease.
Epidemiology
In temperate regions, outbreaks of herpes mammillitis are
sporadic and usually occur in autumn or early winter.
Latent infection and subsequent reactivation
may be important factors in the spread and perpetuation of
infection within herds. In cows calving for the first time,
lesions appear a few days after parturition. Serous exudate
from lesions contains large quantities of virus, and
transmission to other cows in the herd occurs through
direct and indirect contact during milking. Infection occurs
through small abrasions in the skin. Insects may transmit
the virus from animal to animal mechanically. Calves
suckling affected cows can become infected and may
transmit the virus. In Africa, a wide range of wild animal
species appear to act as subclinical reservoirs of infection.
Insect transmission is considered to be important in warm
climates and may account for the occurrence of the
generalized skin form of the disease in those regions.
Pathogenesis
The virus replicates optimally at a temperature lower than
normal  body  temperature.  Following intradermal  or
subcutaneous inoculation, BHV-2 replicates without
dissemination to other sites. In contrast, generalized
infection  with widespread skin nodules develops  in
1491
experimental animals following intravenous inoculation of
BHV-2.
Clinical signs
The number of animals displaying clinical signs during
outbreaks is variable, and subclinical infection is common.
First-lactation  cows  which
have  recently  calved
particularly animals with udder oedema, are most severely
affected. The incubation period is up to 8 days. Lesions
appear as thickened plaques on one or more teats.
Ulceration of the skin leads to scar formation. The lesions
are painful and there is a reduction in milk yield due to
difficulty with milking. In severe cases, lesions may also
appear on the skin of the udder. Circular ulcers may be
present on the lips, nostrils or muzzle of calves suckling
affected cows. In pseudo-lumpy-skin disease, a variable
number of nodules appear on the skin over the neck,
shoulders, back and perineum. The nodules, which are
circular and hard, have depressed centres. They heal
without scar formation within a couple of weeks.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on virus isolation in tissue culture. The
optimal incubation temperature for inoculated cell cultures
is 32°C. A PCR assay has been developed for the detection
of BHV-2 in skin lesions (d'Offay et al., 2003).
Serological tests have been used in attempts to
demonstrate a significant rise in titre but frequently the
first serum sample already has a high titre.
Control
1492
Commercial vaccines are not available. Affected animals
should be isolated and milked separately. Teat dipping and
disinfection of milking machine clusters between cows is
advisable. The most susceptible animals, first-lactation
cows, should be milked first. Insect control measures may
help to limit the spread of disease within a herd.
Malignant catarrhal fever
This severe, sporadic disease of cattle, deer and other
ruminants is frequently fatal. The disease has also been
described in pigs in a number of European countries.
Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is caused by two related
but distinct viruses, alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (A1HV-1)
and ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2). As the wildebeest is
the natural host of AlHV-1, infection with this virus is
confined to Africa. Sheep are the natural hosts of OvHV-2
and infection occurs worldwide in sheep and goats. In
these species, infection is common and subclinical.
Epidemiology
Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 is transmitted vertically and
horizontally in wildebeest populations. There is evidence
that latency occurs in lymphoid cells. Some wildebeest
calves are infected transplacentally but most acquire
infection shortly after birth through nasal secretions from
their mothers or from other calves. Viraemia persists in
young wildebeest for the first few months of life. This
facilitates shedding of large quantities of virus in nasal and
ocular secretions. In-contact cattle may become infected.
The pattern of virus shedding is thought to be similar in
sheep especially at lambing, when transmission to cattle
1493
and farmed deer is most likely to occur. Infection in cattle
and deer is thought to be acquired through contact with
young lambs. However, recent studies suggest that sheep
  ns n    o s a  9 
transmit infection (Li et al., 2004). Cattle and deer are
considered to be ^end-hosts’ because they do not appear to
transmit virus.
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of MCF is poorly understood. It is
presumed that virus enters the body through the
upper respiratory tract. A cell-associated viraemia occurs.
However, virus is difficult to detect at the site of lesions
and it has been suggested that tissue changes in MCF may
have an immunopathological basis. Cellmediated reactions
have been
implicated
lesion   (

Lymphocytes, predominantly
CD8+
 T lymphocytes
accumulate in a variety of organs, frequently associated
with tissue necrosis. It has been proposed that tissue
damage results 
from the unregulatedactivityof
virus-infected cytotoxic T lymphocytes or virus-infected
NK cells (Russell et al., 2009)
Clinical signs
The incubation period, although variable, generally lasts 3
to 4 weeks. The most common clinical presentation is
characterized by sudden onset of fever, oculonasal
discharge, enlarged lymph nodes, conjunctivitis, corneal
opacity and erosive mucosal lesions in the upper
respiratory tract. Profuse mucopurulent  nasal discharge
leads to encrustation of the muzzle. Some animals display
1494
neurological
signsi
 including    muscle   tremors,
incoordination and head pressing. An intestinal form of the
disease presents with diarrhoea or dysentery.
The course of this usually fatal disease is up to 7 days.
Some animals may linger for weeks or months and may
recover (O’ Toole et al., 1997). In peracute disease,
particularly in deer, death may occur without premonitory
signs. There is evidence that mild or inapparent infections
may occur in cattle at risk (Powers et al., 2005).
Diagnosis
Diagnosis   is   based
1on clinical
 presentation   and
post-mortem findings of extensive vasculitis characterized
histologically  by  fibrinoid  degeneration   and   marked
lymphoid infiltration. Ulceration of surface epithelia is a
prominent feature of MCF. Viral DNA can be detected in
circulating
leukocytes,  fresh
tissues
and
paraffin-embedded tissues using PCR (Muller-Doblies et
al., 1998; Crawford et al, 1999). Although a competitive
inhibition ELISA has been developed for the detection of
serum antibodies to A1HV-l and OvHV-2 (Li et al..
1994), it is not as reliable as PCR or histopathological
examination. This competitive ELISA can be used to
determine the prevalence of antibodies in sheep
populations. Although A1HV-1 can be isolated in bovine
thyroid cells from the buffy coat of animals with
wildebeest-associated MCF, ovine herpesvirus 2 has not
yet been grown in tissue culture.
Control
1495
As a vaccine is not available, control depends on the
separation of susceptible species from reservoir hosts.
Using the PCR assay, identification and elimination of
sheep harbouring OvHV-2 in order to establish a virus-free
flock may be worthwhile in defined circumstances.
Aujeszky's disease
This disease is caused by porcine herpesvirus 1, also
referred to as Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV). A single
serotype of the virus is recognized. The pig, in which
subclinical and latent infections can occur, is the natural
host of the virus. Other domestic animals are susceptible
and infection in these incidental hosts, often referred to as
pseudorabies, is usually fatal.
Epidemiology
Infection is endemic in the pig populations of most
countries. The disease has been eradicated from many
countries in recent years. Outbreaks of disease in naive
herds can be devastating, with rapid spread to pigs of all
ages. The virus is shed in oronasal secretions, milk and
semen. Transmission  usually occurs by nose-to-nose
contact or by aerosols. Transplacental transmission occurs
and aborted foetuses are a source of virus. Although the
virus is not stable in the environment, it may remain
infectious for a few days under suitable conditions
Wind-borne transmission over distances of a few
kilometres has been recorded. Sheep, which are highly
susceptible, may acquire infection following direct contact
with pigs or when sharing the same airspace. Scavenging
carnivores may become infected after eating pig meat; cats
1496
are particularly susceptible to infection as are hunting dogs
fed   infected   pig carcasses.  The  opportunity  for
transmission of virus from these animals is limited because
the incubation period is short and the brief clinical course
is invariably fatal in these incidental hosts.
Pathogenesis
Following infection, the virus replicates in the epithelium
of the nasopharynx and tonsils. Virus spreads from these
primary sites to regional lymph nodes and subsequently to
the CNS along axons of the cranial nerves. Virulent strains
of ADV produce a brief viraemia and become widely
distributed throughout the body, particularly in the
respiratory tract. Virus replication in alveolar macrophages
interferes with their
phagocytic function. Transplacental transfer results in
 generalized infection of foetuses. Infected animals excrete
virus for up to 3 weeks following infection. Latency occurs
in a high percentage of infected animals, with virus
localizing in the trigeminal ganglia and tonsils.
Clinical signs
The age and susceptibility of infected pigs and the
virulence of the infecting strain influence the severity of
the clinical signs. Young pigs are most severely affected;
mortality may approach 1oo% in suckling piglets. In
neonatal piglets, the incubation period may be as short as
36 hours compared with 5 days in older pigs. Neurological
signs, including incoordination, tremors, paddling and
convulsions, predominate in young pigs. Affected animals
usually die within 2 days. Mortality is much lower in
1497
weaned pigs although neurological and respiratory signs
are often present. Fever, weight loss and signs of
respiratory disease including sneezing, coughing, nasal
discharge and dyspnoea may be evident in fatteners.
Neurological signs are uncommon in these older animals
and they usually recover within a week. Infection in sows
early in pregnancy usually results in resorption of foetuses
and return to oestrus. Later in pregnancy, infection
frequently produces abortion; full-term piglets may be
stillborn or weak. In herds with endemic ADV infection,
neonatal animals are  protected by  maternally  derived
antibody.
       
is characterized by neurological signs resembling those of
rabies. Intense  pruritus  (mad itch") leadingto
self-mutilation is a feature of the disease, particularly in
ruminants. The clinical course is short with most affected
animals dying within a few days.
Diagnosis
The history, clinical signs and lesions may suggest ADV
infection.  Laboratory confirmation  is based on virus
isolation, detection of viral antigen, serology
and
histopathological findings.
·Specimens of brain, spleen and lung from acutely affected
animals are suitable for virus isolation. In the event of a
delay between collection and tissue culture inoculation,
samples should be refrigerated.
· Cryostat sections of tonsil or brain are suitable for detection
of viral antigen by immunofluorescence.
1498
· Both PCR and real time PCR assays have been developed
for the detection of the viral genome in secretions and tissues
(McKillen et al., 2007).
· Serological tests, including virus neutralization and ELISA,
are available for detecting ADV antibodies. In young pigs,
maternally derived antibodies may be present up to the age
       
introduced for the detection of antibodies to the surface
glycoproteins gC, gE and gG. These assays are designed to
differentiate animals infected with field virus from those
vaccinated with a gene-deleted mutant lacking a particular
surface glycoprotein, gE being the usual deletion used.

development of clinical disease. Modified live, inactivated
and gene-deleted vaccines are available. Vaccines have
been produced in which the thymidine kinase (TK) gene
has been deleted together with a gene encoding one of the
non-essential surface glycoproteins. Because endogenous
levels of TK are low in neurons, this gene-deleted virus
cannot replicate in neurons and as a consequence is
significantly reduced in virulence. However, such vaccinal

of recombination of field virus with a gene-deleted virus
and the subsequent generation of a virulent ADV has been
suggested (Maes et al., 1997). Eradication of Aujeszky's
disease can be achieved by depopulation, by test and
removal, or by segregation of litters. The development and
use of effective DIVA or marker vaccines in conjunction
in the field of Aujeszky's disease, making eradication
feasible and economically worthwhile. The disease has
1499
been eradicated from domestic pigs in several European
countries, Canada and New Zealand. Eradication
programmes are underway in several other countries
including Ireland. In the USA, domesticated pigs are free
of the disease but infection is still present in feral pigs.
Equine rhinopneumonitis and equine herpesvirus abortion
Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-l) and equine herpesvirus 4
worldwide, are responsible for outbreaks of respiratory
disease in young horses and for abortion. Before 1981, it
was considered that the pathogen was a single virus,
EHV-1, composed of two subtypes. However, restriction
endonuclease analysis showed that the subtypes were two
distinct viruses. Infection with EHV-l is associated with
respiratory disease, abortion, fatal generalized disease in
neonatal foals and encephalo-
myelitis. Although infection with EHV-4 is primarily
associated with respiratory disease, sporadic abortions
have also been attributed to this virus.
Epidemiology
Close contact facilitates transmission of these fragile
viruses. Transmission usually occurs by the respiratory
route following contact with infected nasal secretions,
aborted foetuses, placentae or uterine fluids. Both EHV-1
and EHV-4 can occur as latent infections. Serological
surveys using a type-specific ELISA have shown that there
is a high prevalence of antibody to EHV-4, approaching
100% in some populations (Gilkerson et al, 1999b). It is
thought that episodes of reactivation of latent EHV-4
1500
infection without coincident clinical disease occur in adult
horses, resulting in transmission to foals. The prevalence
of antibody to EHV-1 is about 30% in adult horses; it is
lower in foals (Gilkerson et al, 1999b). It appears that foals
become infected with EHV-l from their dams or from
other lactating mares in the group. Foal-to-foal spread may
occur both before and after weaning (Gilkerson et al.,
1999a). Even without aborting, mares infected with EHV-1
are potential sources of infection. When reactivation of
infection in a latent carrier mare occurs in a stud farm,
exposure of non-immune, in-contact pregnant mares may
lead to an abortion storm.
Pathogenesis
These viruses replicate initially in the upper respiratory
tract and regional lymph nodes extending in some cases to
the lower respiratory tract and lungs. Latent infection of
the trigeminal ganglia with both EHV-1 and EHV-4 may
occur. Infections with EHV-4 appear to be restricted to the
respiratory tract and viraemia is uncommon. In contrast,
     l   
lymphocyte-associated viraemia which disseminates the
virus around the body and can result in abortion or
neurological disease. Latent infection of lymphocytes with
EHV-l has been demonstrated and can be followed bv
reactivation. The virus can spread directly from infected
leukocytes to contiguous cells, thus avoiding neutralization
by circulating antibody.  Equine herpesvirus 1 has a
predilection for vascular endothelium. Vasculitis and
thrombosis in the placenta along with transplacental
infection of the foetus result in abortion. Vasculitis and
thrombosis, associated with EHV-1 infection, may also
1501
occur in the CNS especially in the spinal cord, with
resultant  ischaemia  and  myelomalacia.  Neurological
changes appear to be related to infection with particular
neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1, as a result of a single
      
polymerase (Nugent et al., 2006). It has been reported that
horses regularly vaccinated with killed vaccines are at an
increased risk of developing equine herpesvirus-associated
neurological disease and an anamnestic immune response
1S
considered    an   important    prerequisite   for    the
immune-mediated  vascular damage associated with the
condition (Borchers et al., 2006).
Clinical signs
Respiratory disease caused by EHV-4 occurs in foals over
2 months of age, in weanlings and in yearlings. Following
an incubation period of 2 to 10 days, there are signs of
fever, pharyngitis and serous nasal discharge. Secondary
bacterial infection is common, giving rise to mucopurulent
nasal discharge,
coughing
and，insome
cases,
bronchopneumonia. In the absence of serious secondary
infection, recovery usually occurs within 2 weeks.
Respiratory disease associated with EHV-1 is clinically
indistinguishable from that caused by EHV-4; outbreaks of
disease caused by EHV-1, however, are less common.
Immunity, following primary respiratory tract infection,
lasts only a few months and is restricted to antigenically
similar viruses. Multiple infections result in significant
cross-protection against heterologous herpesvirus. Mares
which abort following infection with EHV-1 rarely show
premonitory signs. Abortion occurs several weeks or
months after exposure, usually during the last 4 months of
1502
gestation. Such infected mares rarely abort during
subsequent pregnancies and their fertility is unaffected.
Infection close to term may result in the birth of an
infected foal which usually dies due to interstitial
pneumonia and viral damage in other tissues, sometimes
complicated by  secondary bacterial  infection.  Although
neurological signs associated with EHV-1l infection are
relatively uncommon, they may present in several horses
during an outbreak of abortion or respiratory disease on a
farm. The signs range from slight incoordination to
paralysis, recumbency and death.
Diagnosis
Virus isolation and identification are used routinely for the
laboratory confirmation of herpesvirus infection in horses.
Nasopharyngeal swabs should be collected during the early
stages of respiratory infections and dispatched in suitable
transport medium to the laboratory.
Viral antigen may be demonstrated in cryostat sections of
lung, liver and spleen from aborted foetuses using
immunofluorescence.
· The characteristic gross and microscopic lesions, particularly
intranuclear inclusions in areas of hepatic necrosis, may be
sufficient   for   confirmation   of  herpesvirus   abortion.
Vasculitis is commonly found in the myeloencephalopathy
caused by herpesvirus.
·The polymerase chain reaction is widely used for the
detection of viral DNA in clinical specimens. It is capable of
differentiating EHV-1 from EHV-4 (Varrasso et al., 2001)
·Demonstration of a fourfold rise in antibody titre in paired
serum  samples is useful  for  confirmation of  a recent
outbreak. Most serological tests do not distinguish infection
with EHV-1 from infection with EHV-4 because of antigenic
cross-reactivity. ELISA-type assays employing monoclonal
antibody or recombinant glycoprotein G antigens can
1503
distinguish the two viruses (Crabb et al., 1995).
Complement-fixing antibodies decline to undetectable levels
within a few months and, accordingly, are useful for
identifying recent infection.
Control
Effective management  practices  and  vaccination  are
essential for control. Animals returning from sales, races
or other events should be segregated for up to 4 weeks. On
large stud farms, horses should be kept in small, physically
separated groups. It is essential that pregnant mares be
segregated in a stress-free environment. Following an
outbreak of disease, affected animals should be isolated.
Premises should be disinfected and movement should be
restricted until animals on the premises have been clear of
the disease for at least a month.
Modified  live and   inactivated  virus   vaccines  are
commercially available. Vaccination with live vaccines is
10u
 permitted   in some countries.  Many  vaccine
vaccination is not considered to be fully protective,
frequent boosters are recommended. Vaccination appears
to reduce the severity of clinical signs and to decrease the
likelihood of abortion. It is a valuable adjunct to sound
management practices aimed at controlling the disease.
Equine coital exanthema
This benign venereal disease of horses, caused by equine
herpesvirus 3 (EHV-3), is thought to occur worldwide.
Epidemiology
1504
Serological surveys indicate that the prevalence of
infection in breeding animals is about 50%. The reported
incidence of the disease is much lower, presumably
because many infections are subclinical. The principal
  s  [ s isss  o
may also occur through contaminated instruments.
Immunity to reinfection is short lived and clinical signs
may develop in the same animal in consecutive breeding
seasons.
Pathogenesis
Although latent infection with EHV-3 has not been
conclusively demonstrated, it is thought that it probably
occurs in sacral ganglia and that outbreaks of disease are
initiated by reactivation of latent infection. The virus,
which has a tropism for keratinized epithelium, is
temperature sensitive and replication is restricted at core
body  temperature. Viraemia and abortion  are not
associated with EHV-3 infection.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 10 days. Lesions on external
genitalia appear initially as red papules which develop into
vesicles and pustules. The pustules rupture leaving ulcers
that may coalesce. Lesions are occasionally encountered
on the teats, lips and nares. Secondary bacterial infection is
common. In uncomplicated cases, lesions heal within 2
weeks. On pigmented skin, sites of healed lesions appear
as white spots. Infection can affect the fertility of stallions
as they may refuse to serve mares when penile lesions are
severe.
1505
Diagnosis
Clinical diagnosis  is based on  the distribution and
appearance of the lesions. Electron microscopy of lesion
scrapings or virus isolation in tissue culture at 34°C can be
used to confirm infection. Viral DNA can be detected in
skin lesions by PCR (Kleiboeker and Chapman, 2004).
Virus neutralization and ELISA are suitable assays for
demonstrating a rising antibody titre in paired serum
samples. However, in some cases the antibody response
may be minimal and failure to demonstrate a significant
rise is not necessarily evidence of absence of infection.
Control
Affected horses should be isolated and should not be used
for   breeding  until  lesions  have  completely  healed.
Disposable gloves should be used for genital examination
and equipment should be thoroughly disinfected after use.
An effective vaccine is not available.
Canine herpesvirus infection
Infection in domestic and wild Canidae caused by canine
herpesvirus 1 (CHV-1) is common worldwide. Clinical
disease caused by the virus is uncommon, but when
infection occurs in neonatal pups it results in generalized
disease with accompanying high mortality
Epidemiology
Prevalence rates, based on serological surveys of dogs, are
88% in England and 42% in The Netherlands (Reading and
1506
Field, 1998; Rijsewijk et al., 1999). Infection usually
occurs by the oronasal route following direct contact
between infected and susceptible animals. During periods
of stress, latent infections may be reactivated with
shedding of virus. The sites of latency include sensory
ganglia (Burr et al., 1996; Miyoshi et al., 1999). Virus is
shed in oronasal and vaginal secretions. Newborn pups,
which can acquire infection either in utero or during
parturition, may be an additional source of infection for
littermates.
Pathogenesis
Following infection, CHV-1 replicates in the nasal
mucosa, pharynx and tonsils. The virus replicates most
effectively  at  temperatures  below  normal  adult  body
temperature with the result that infection in adults is
external genitalia. Because the hypothalamic regulatory
centre is not fully operational in pups under 4 weeks of
age, they are particularly dependent on ambient
temperature and maternal contact for maintenance of
normal body temperature. A cell-associated viraemia and
widespread viral replication in visceral organs can occur in
infected  neonatal
  animals   with decreased   body
temperatures.
Clinical signs
In adult dogs and pups over 4 weeks of age, infection is
usually asymptomatic. Occasionally, vesicular lesions on
external genitalia and mild vaginitis or balanoposthitis may
be observed. Primary infection of pregnant bitches may
1507
result in abortion, stillbirths and infertility. Pups infected
during parturition or shortly after birth develop clinical
signs within days. Affected pups stop sucking, show signs
of abdominal pain, whine incessantly and die within days
Morbidity and mortality rates tend to be high in affected
litters. Bitches whose pups are affected tend to produce
healthy litters subsequently. Pups which receive colostral
antibodies may
y  become  infected   without developing
clinical signs.
Diagnosis
Diagnostically  significant post-mortem findings include
focal areas of necrosis and haemorrhage, particularly in the
kidneys. Intranuclear inclusions are usually present. Virus
          
specimens of liver, kidney, lung and spleen. In situ
hybridization and PCR protocols are available.
Control
A commercial subunit vaccine is available and has been
shown to decrease pup mortality following administration
to pregnant bitches (Poulet et al., 2001). Affected bitches
and their litters should be isolated to prevent infection of
other whelping bitches. Heating lamps and pads, which
raise the body temperature of pups to 39°C, may help to
reduce the severity of infection if initiated prior to or at the
time of exposure to the virus.
Feline viral rhinotracheitis
1508
This acute upper respiratory tract infection of young cats is
caused by feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1). The virus, which
is distributed worldwide, accounts for about 40% of
respiratory infections in cats. Both domestic and wild
species of Felidae are susceptible
Epidemiology
Close contact is required for transmission. The prevalence
of infection is higher in cats in colonies than in cats reared
individually. Virus  is shed in oral and oculonasal
secretions. Due to its relative lability, survival in the
environment is short. Most recovered cats are latentlv
infected. Reactivation with virus replication and shedding
is particularly associated with periods of stress such as
parturition, lactation or change of housing. Several days
elapse between exposure to stress and shedding of virus.
The kittens of carrier queens may become infected
subclinicallywhileprotected
1bymaternally-derived
antibody. These kittens may become carriers and, as
adults, perpetuate the infection. In common with many
herpesvirus infections in other species, the trigeminal
ganglia are important sites of latency.
Pathogenesis
Initially, FHV-l replicates in oronasal or conjunctival
tissues before infecting the epithelium of the upper
respiratory tract. Viraemia and generalized infection does
not appear to occur except in animals at the
extremes of age and in immunocompromised cats.
Secondary bacterial infections, which commonly occur,
exacerbate the clinical signs.
1509
Clinical signs
The incubation period is usually short, about 2 days, but
may be up to 6 days. Young cats display signs of acute
upper respiratory tract infection including fever, sneezing.

Diagnosis
Clinical differentiation of feline viral rhinotracheitis from
feline calicivirus infection is difficult.
·Virus can be isolated in feline cell lines from oropharyngeal
or conjunctival sw abs.
·Specific viral antigen can be demonstrated in acetone-fixed
nasal and conjunctival smears using immunofluorescence.
 Several PCR protocols have been published and compared
for sensitivity (Maggs and Clarke, 2005). In terms of clinical
relevance, particularly in the absence of characteristic
clinical signs, a positive result may simply be an incidental
finding as all latently infected cats may shed virus
intermittently. Quantitative assessment using real-time PCR
may be more informative (Vogtlin et al., 2002).
·The virus neutralization test or ELISA can be used on paired
serum samples to demonstrate a rising titre for confirmation
Of diagnosis.
Treatment and control
1510
  r   
Nucleoside analogues such as trifluridine, idoxuridine.
vidarabine and acyclovir have been used topically for
FHV-l ocular disease with some success, but large-scale
clinical trials have not been carried out. Other treatments,
including feline interferon and L-lysine, have also been
investigated. Antibiotics are frequently used to control
secondary bacterial infections. The protection provided by
vaccination is incomplete as vaccinated cats can become
infected but clinical signs and shedding tend to be much
reduced. Inactivated vaccines are suitable for use in
pregnant queens and help to boost levels of maternal
antibody available for kittens. Intranasal vaccines may
give rise to mild upper respiratory signs. When cats are at
low risk of exposure to infection, booster vaccinations at
3-year intervals may be sufficient (Elston et al., 1998;
Scott and Geissinger,
19991.
.Commercial vaccine
preparations also contain feline calicivirus. Developments
in vaccine production include the use of avirulent deletion
mutant virus strains and, in addition, the insertion of the
feline calicivirus capsid gene into the modified FHV-1
genome (Gaskell and Willoughby, 1999). Good husbandry
practices and disease control procedures should be
implemented  in  catteries  in  conjunction  with regular
vaccination schedules to minimize the impact of clinical
disease. In breeding colonies where the disease is endemic,
additional measures should be implemented including the
isolation of queens and their kittens, early weaning of
kittens into isolation and vaccination at an early age.
Infectious laryngotracheitis
1511
This highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens and
sometimes pheasants is caused by gallid herpes-virus 1
(GaHV-1).  Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) occurs  in
many countries. Although strains of GaHV-l vary in
virulence, they are antigenically homogeneous. In areas of
intensive poultry production, the disease is usually well
controlled  by  a combination of   vaccination  and
biosecurity. However, the virus tends to persist in small
enterprises and specialized chicken flocks as an endemic
infection.
Epidemiology
Typically, infection is transmitted through aerosols,
especially among intensively reared birds. Latency occurs
in the trigeminal ganglia, and carrier birds may shed virus
intermittently after periods of stress such as the onset of
laying or when groups of birds are mixed. Indirect
transmission from one production unit to another may
occur through contaminated fomites.
Pathogenesis
Following inhalation, virus replicates locally in the upper
respiratory tract. Spread along sensory nerves results in
localization in the trigeminal ganglia
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 12 days. The epidemic form
of the disease, caused by virulent strains of
GaHV-1, is characterized by coughing, gasping, moist
rales, oculonasal discharge, expectoration of bloodstained
1512
mucus and head shaking. Mortality may reach 70%. Death
is often due to severe obstructive haemorrhagic
laryngotracheitis. Mild respiratory signs, conjunctivitis and
decreased egg production are features of infection with
strains of low virulence.
Diagnosis
In severe outbreaks of ILT, the clinical signs and
postmortem findings may be sufficiently characteristic for
diagnosis. In outbreaks of the mild form of the disease,
laboratory confirmation is necessary. Virus isolation can
be carried out on the chorioallantoic membrane of
embryonated eggs or in avian cell cultures. Rapid methods
of diagnosis include demonstration of herpesvirus particles
of viral antigen
in smears or
frozen sections by
immunofluorescence. Viral antigen can be detected in
tracheal samples by ELISA or agar gel immunodiffusion
(AGID). The PCR assay is considered to be more sensitive
than virus isolation for the detection of GaHV-l and
permits the differentiation of field and vaccinal strains
using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
analysis of amplified fragments. Real time PCR assays
demonstrated by virus neutralization, ELISA or AGID.
Control
Flock management systems and  vaccination  protocols
form the basis of control methods. In broiler flocks, short
production cycles and all-in all-out management systems
ensure that they remain free of the disease. In layer flocks,
1513
vaccination is usually carried out using live vaccines
administered by aerosols or in drinking water. Vaccination
protects against clinical disease but is ineffective against
infection by field virus and the establishment of latency.
Genetically  engineered  vaccines  are  currently  being
evaluated.
Marek's disease
This contagious lymphoproliferative disease of chickens is
caused by gallid herpesvirus 2 (Marek's disease virus),
which is a cell-associated and oncogenic virus. The
disease, which is of major economic significance in the
poultry industry, occurs worldwide. Herpesviruses of
chickens and turkeys in the genus Mardivirus can be
divided into three serotypes or species. Serotype 1 (gallid
herpesvirus 2) includes all pathogenic strains and the
attenuated variants derived from these strains; serotype 2
(gallid    herpesvirus    3)
  contains   avirulent
 and
non-oncogenic strains; the third serotype, meleagrid
herpesvirus 1, is an avirulent herpesvirus of turkeys.
Serotype l strains can be categorized as mildly virulent,
virulent and highly virulent.
Epidemiology
Productive replication with release of infective virus
occurs only in the epithelium of the feather follicle.
Cell-free virus is released from the follicles along with
desquamated cells. This dander can remain infective for
several months in poultry-house dust and litter. Infected
birds remain carriers for life, and their chicks, which are
protected initially by maternally-derived antibody, acquire
1514
infection within a few weeks, usually by the respiratory
route. In addition to the virulence of the infecting strain of
herpesvirus, host factors that contribute to the severity of
the disease include genotype, sex and age at the time of
infection. The best characterized genetic locus associated
histocompatibility complex (MHC). Female birds are more
susceptible to the disease than male birds; the reason for
this difference is unknown. Resistance to the development
of disease increases with age. Transportation, vaccination,
handling and beak trimming are stress factors that increase
susceptibility to disease.
Pathogenesis and pathology
Following inhalation, virus replicates locally before
transfer, probably within macrophages, to the major
lymphoid organs where it causes cytolysis, primarily of B
cells. Latent infection occurs in T cells activated by the
cytolytic process involving B cells.A persistent
cell-associated viraemia results in dissemination of the
virus throughout the body. Infection of epithelial cells in
feather follicles occurs about 2 weeks after infection
Cytolysis of these epithelial cells results in shedding of
virus  particles  into
 the  environment. Genetically
susceptible chickens are prone to tumour development and
immunosuppression, associated with apoptosis of T cells
and thymocytes along with down-regulation of CD8
molecule expression. Lymphomatous lesions may become
evident in these birds from 2 weeks to several months after
infection. Transformation of T cells probably relates to
oncogenes in certain serotype 1 strains. Multiple copies of
the virus genome are found in transformed cells, both as
1515
episomal DNA and integrated into host cell DNA. Several
genomic regions with potential roles in transformation
have been identified (Venugopal, 2001)
including meq (which resembles the Jun/Fos family of
oncogenic transcription factor proteins), a basic-leucine
zippergene
(Calnek, 1998). 
Defective immune
surveillance mechanisms can allow transformed cells to
form lymphoid tumours. The peripheral nerves are often
affected, exhibiting proliferative (type A), inflammatory
(type  B)  or
minor infiltrative (type C) changes.
Demyelination, which is found in type A and type B
lesions, causes paralysis. The acute form of Marek's
disease is characterized by diffuse infiltration of many
internal organs with neoplastic lymphoid cells. A surface
antigen expressed on transformed lymphocytes, formerly
called   Marek's   disease   tumour-associated   antigen
(MATSA), is now considered to be merely a marker for
activated T cells.
Clinical signs
Birds between 12 and 24 weeks of age are most commonly
affected. Clinically, Marek's disease presents as partial or
complete paralysis of the legs and wings. The mortality
rate rarely exceeds 15% with deaths occurring over a
number of weeks or months. In the acute form of the
disease, birds are severely depressed before death or may
die without clinical evidence of disease. The mortality rate
in the acute form of the disease is usually between 1o%
and 30%; outbreaks with mortality as high as 70% have
been reported.
Diagnosis
1516
The diagnosis of Marek's disease is based on clinical signs
and pathological findings.
· Paralysis of legs and wings in conjunction with thickening of
the peripheral nerves is typical of Marek's disease.
· In adult birds, nerve involvement is not always evident. In
these birds, differentiation from lymphoid leukosis is
particularly important.
·Differentiation from lymphoid leukosis is based on the age
of affected birds, the incidence of clinical cases and the
histopathological findings.
·Virus can be isolated from the buffy coat of blood samples
or suspensions of spleen or lymphoma cells from infected
birds. Chicken kidney cells or duck embryo fibroblasts can
be used for isolation of the virus.
 s go sd  a aa  e l -
feather tips, using a radial precipitin test.
· Serum antibodies to GaHV-2 may be demonstrated using
AGID, ELISA, immunofluorescence or virus neutralization.
·Primers, which can distinguish attenuated and wild-type
strains, have been developed for PCR assays. Suitable
sources of viral DNA include blood and feather tips.
· In the absence of characteristic clinical signs, infection with
gallid herpesvirus 2 is not indicative of Marek's disease in a
flock.
Control
The use of appropriate management strategies, genetically
resistant stock and vaccination have reduced losses from
Marek's disease. Disinfection, all-in all-out policies, and
rearing young chicks away from older birds for the first 2
or 3 months of life reduce exposure to infection,
decreasing the likelihood of high mortality. A range of
modified  live  vaccines   containing
the three avian
herpesvirus    serotypes   are    commercially    available.
1517
Although a single dose of virus injected into day-old
chicks provides good lifelong protection, it does not
prevent superinfection with virulent field viruses. A
synergistic protective effect is obtained by using two or
three strains in a vaccine. Consequently meleagrid
herpesvirus 1 is commonly incorporated into bivalent or
trivalent vaccines. Novel vaccines based on recombinant
DNA technology are being developed because of a
reduction in the efficacy of conventional vaccines due to
emergence of virulent mutants (Witter, 1998). Automated
in ovo vaccination at the eighteenth day of incubation has
replaced  conventional  vaccination  methods  in  large
commercial units (Ricks et al., 1999).

Papillomaviridae
Viruses in the family Papillomaviridae (Latin papilla,
nipple, combined with Greek suffix -oma used to denote
tumours)  are  non-enveloped  with  icosahedral  capsids
which
contain
a singlemoleculeofcircular
double-stranded DNA. The family contains 16 genera.
Papillomaviruses are 55 nm in diameter (Fig. 62.1).
Replication takes place in the nucleus and release of new
virions occurs by lysis of the infected cell. Members of the
family are resistant to lipid solvents, acid and heating at
60°C for 30 minutes. Infections, which are often persistent,
usually become established early in life. Papillomaviruses
   is  dxa s 
cultured cells.
Formerly, papillomaviruses
were
 grouped
with
polyomaviruses in the family Papovaviridae. Infections
with polyomaviruses are of minor veterinary importance.
Although they produce no clinical effects in natural hosts,
most polyomaviruses (polyoma, many tumours) are
oncogenic   when  inoculated   into
 newborm  rodents.
Budgerigar fledgling disease, caused by an avian
polyomavirus, is characterized by outbreaks of acute
generalized infection  with high mortality in young
budgerigars.
Clinical infections
1525
These epitheliotropic, host-specific papillomaviruses cause
proliferative lesions (warts) in many mammalian and avian
species. Although many papillomaviruses have not been
grown in cell culture, the DNA sequences of several
papillomaviruses have been elucidated, allowing specific
detection in lesions. In infected cells, the viral DNA is
usually episomal.

Theclinicalconditionsassociatedwithpapillomavirus
infections in domestic animals are presented in Table 62.1.
Papillomaviruses tend to be host-specific and to produce
proliferative lesions in specific anatomical sites. Infections
only those that affect humans, cattle, horses and dogs are
of clinical significance. Lesions, which are most
commonly observed in young animals, usually regress
spontaneously after weeks or months. Regression is
attributed to the
development
tofcell-mediated
immunity.
 Typical
papillomas are composed of finger-like projections of
proliferating epithelium supported by a thin core of mature
fibrous tissue. In fibropapillomas, the fibrous tissue
component predominates. In some host species, several
papillomaviruses can cause neoplastic change. Several
viral species and more than 80 genotypes have been
identified in humans, while in cattle three species and up to
ten genotypes are recognized. Recent changes in taxonomy
(de Villiers et al., 2004) have resulted in the grouping of
papillomavirus
 types
into
species.
 Three
 bovine
papillomavirus
 spec1es
are
recognized:
bovine
papillomavirus 1 (BPV genotypes 1 and 2), bovine
papillomavirus 3 (BPV genotypes 3, 4 and 6) and bovine
       
genotypes of bovine papillomavirus (BPV), genotypes 1, 2
and 5 (group A) and genotypes 3, 4 and 6 (group B), can
be categorized on the basis of size of genome and the type
1527
and location of associated lesions. Group A viruses infect
both epithelial cells and fibroblasts while Group B viruses
infect epithelial cells only. The genome of BPV 5 shares
similarities with the genomes of both xipapillomaviruses
and deltapapillomaviruses. In addition, BPV 5 appears to
be capable of giving rise to both fibropapillomas and
epithelial papillomas (Bloch et al., 1994). As a result, BPV
5
has
been
placed inaseparate
egenus,
Epsilonpapillomavirus. Several novel BPVs have recently
been identified and at least ten genotypes are now
recognized.  Progression  of papillomas to  malignant
tumours has been documented in humans, cattle and
rabbits.

Pathogenesis
Papillomaviruses infect the basal cells of squamous
epithelium, usually as a result of minute abrasions. Viruses
may also gain entry at vulnerable sites such as junctions
between different  types of epithelia. Infected cells
proliferate but  differentiation  is  delayed. Viral  gene
expression is restricted during this proliferative phase. Full
gene expression results in the production of viral capsids
only after cellular differentiation begins in the more
superficial  epithelial  layers.  The  normal differentiation
process is subverted by the virus, the cell nucleus is
retained and synthesis of  viral proteins necessary for
replication and assembly proceeds. New virions can be
visualized by electron microscopy in the nuclei of
differentiated keratinized cells. Release of virus occurs
during desquamation of infected cells from the surface of
lesions.
Diagnosis
· Because the clinical appearance of papillomas (warts) is
distinctive, laboratory confirmation is not usually required
for papillomatous lesions.
·Histopathological examination may be required to determine
the nature of some lesions, especially equine sarcoids.
· Electron microscopic examination of specimens from the
epidermis may reveal characteristic virus particles.

Bovine cutaneous papillomatosis
1530
In cattle, cutaneous papillomatosis is caused by several
types of bovine papillomavirus. Cutaneous fibropapillomas
are generally associated with BPV types 1, 2 or 5, whereas
BPV types 3, 4 or 6 are commonly linked to papillomas in
which the fibrous tissue component is minimal. The
different gross appearances of  the  two  types  of
proliferative response are exemplified by lesions produced
by types of papillomavirus on teats of cows. Teat
fibropapillomas, associated with BPV-5 infection, have
smooth surfaces and are described as ^rice grain’ type. In
contrast, ‘frond’ type teat papillomas arise from infection
with BPV-6. Predilection of viruses in this group for
       
papillomaviruses which produce teat lesions.
Fibropapillomas arising from infection with BPV types 1
or 2 are often found on the head and neck of cattle under 2
years of age. Spontaneous regression of the lesions
generally occurs within 1 year. Cutaneous papillomas
caused by BPV-3 tend to persist. Because infection with
BPV is usually self-limiting, treatment is seldom required.
Surgical removal of large lesions on teats may be
necessary because of interference with milking. Although
inactivated autogenous vaccines are used therapeutically,
their efficacy is unproven. However, inactivated vaccines
can be used prophylactically.
Bovine alimentary papilloma-carcinoma complex
Papillomas of the oesophagus, rumen and reticulum are
associated with BPV-4 infection. The lesions, which are
often solitary and relatively small, are found incidentally at
post-mortem
examination.
Epidemiological
and
1531
experimental studies have demonstrated that there is an
increased frequency in  the occurrence of malignant
transformation of virus-induced alimentary papillomas to
squamous cell carcinomas when animals are ingesting
bracken fern (Jarrett et al., 1978; Campo et al., 1994).
Such malignant lesions, which are found in anatomical
sites identical to those of the papillomas, may cause
difficulty in swallowing, ruminal tympany and loss of
condition. Nodular fibropapillomas caused by  BPV-2,
which are occasionally found in similar upper alimentary
tract locations, do not appear to become malignant.
Enzootic haematuria
Enzootic haematuria is encountered worldwide in cattle on
poor pastures with abundant bracken fern growth. The
haemorrhage originates from tumours in the bladder wall.
Individual neoplastic lesions derive from either epithelial
or mesenchymal tissues. Experimental studies suggest that
BPV-2 and toxic compounds from bracken contribute to
oncogenesis (Campo et al., 1992). It is probable that
immunosuppression following ingestion of bracken may
allow activation of latent BPV-2 in bladder tissues and this
effect, together with the action of carcinogens also present
in bracken, is responsible for the induction and progression
of neoplastic lesions.
Equine papillomatosis
Papillomas are commonly encountered in horses between 1
d  f s    s  
have been identified based on DNA studies. Type 1 is
associated with papillomas on the muzzle and legs, while
1532
type 2 is associated with papillomas of the genital tract.
Spread may occur by direct
or  indirect  contact.  The lesions usually regress
spontaneously after several months and recovered animals
are immune to reinfection.
Equine sarcoid
The equine sarcoid, a locally invasive fibroblastic skin
tumour, is the most common neoplasm of horses, donkeys
and mules (Marti et al., 1993). Bovine papillomavirus 1 or
a closely related variant is implicated in  sarcoid
development.  Experimental  inoculation   of susceptible
animals with these viruses results in fibromatous lesions
which resemble sarcoids but which regress spontaneously.
Viral DNA with a high degree of homology to BPV has
been identified in tissue from sarcoids using both in situi
hybridization (Lory et al, 1993) and PCR (Otten et al.,
1993).
Lesions usually develop in horses between 3 and 6 vears of
age. Clusters of equine sarcoid cases have been reported in
closely related horses and also in groups of horses on the
same farm. However, the incidence of equine sarcoid
(estimated at 0.5 to 2%) is comparatively low for a viral
disease. This may indicate that the horse is a
non-permissive host (Marti et al., 1993).
Sarcoids can occur on any part of the body, either singly or
in clusters. The most commonly affected sites are the head.
ventral abdomen and limbs. They are highly variable in
appearance but can be arbitrarily categorized as verrucous
or fibroblastic. Clinical diagnosis should be confirmed
1533
histologically. Surgical removal is the usual form of
treatment. Recurrence is common following conventional
surgery and cryosurgery is more successful. Radiation
therapy, CO2 laser surgery and chemotherapy have also
been used with varying degrees of success (Knottenbelt et
al., 1995). Immunotherapy, aimed at stimulating
cell-mediated immunity, may be effective in some cases.
This involves intralesional injection of BCG or cell-wall
extract of Mycobacterium bovis into horses previously
sensitized to tuberculoprotein. A novel therapy involving
the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting viral
gene expression of the E2 protein has been shown to be
effective in vitro (Gobeil et al., 2009)
Canine oral papillomatosis
Multiple transmissible papillomas in the oropharyngeal
region of dogs are often encountered. This condition.
which is caused by canine oral papillomavirus, is common
in young dogs and is readily transmitted. While the
aetiology of this oral condition is well established, the
cause of papillomas occurring at other sites in the dog is
uncertain (Narama et al., 1992).
Canine oral papillomavirus is transmitted by direct and
indirect contact. The incubation period is up to 8 weeks.
Lesions are usually
1multiple and although generally
confined to the oral mucosa are sometimes found on the
conjunctiva, eyelids and muzzle. The papillomas initially
appear as smooth, white, raised lesions but later they
become rough and cauliflowerlike. Spread may occur
inside the oral cavity. There is spontaneous regression
within months. Surgical removal is generally unnecessary
1534
unless the papillomas persist or cause physical discomfort.
Inactivated vaccines have been used but do not appear to
be effective. Live unattenuated vaccines, which are
effective, may produce neoplastic lesions at the injection
site (Bregman et al, 1987).

Adenoviridae
Adenoviruses (Greek adenos, gland), first isolated from
expiant cultures of human adenoids, are icosahedral (70 to
90 nm in diameter) and contain a single linear molecule of
double-stranded DNA. Fibres project from each of the 12
vertices of the capsid (Fig. 63.1). Agglutination of rat or
monkey erythrocytes, a property of many adenoviruses, is
dependent  on  the
fibre
proteinswhich
1possess
type-specific
immunodetermi-
nants. The  family
Adenoviridae is composed of four genera, Mastadenovirus,
Aviadenovirus,
andSiadenovirus.One
further genus has been proposed, Ichtadenovirus, for fish
adenoviruses. Mammalian adenoviruses, assigned to the
genus Mastadenovirus, infect mammals only, share a
that infect birds. Serogroups and serotypes are defined on
the basis of neutralization
assays. Haemagglutination
inhibition is used to confirm serospecificity. Adenoviruses
are moderately stable in the environment, in which they
can survive for many weeks. They can withstand freezing,
abolished by heating at 56°C for more than 10 minutes but
heat sensitivity varies from genus to genus.
Adenoviruses replicate in cell nuclei. Newly assembled
virions  form  crystalline aggregates, demonstrable as
intranuclear   basophilic   inclusions   in   stained    tissue
sections. Adenoviruses have a natural host range generally
confined to a single species or to closely related species.
1538
Infection is common in animals and humans. Fifty-one
human serotypes have been recognized, grouped into six
species (human adenovi- rus A to F). Most human
infections appear to be subclinical or mild, although
immunodeficient individuals may develop severe clinical
disease. In contrast to human infections, certain animal
infections result in severe illness. Genera and species
belonging to the Adenoviridae are listed in Fig. 63.2.
Adenoviruses of veterinary importance are presented in
Table 63.1.

Clinical infections
Adenovirus infections can be particularly severe in dogs
and domestic fowl. Two serotypes of canine adenovirus
are recognized. Infection with canine adenovirus type 1
1539
(CAV-l) causes infectious canine hepatitis, a severe
generalized disease, whereas
 infection withcanine
adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) is commonly associated with
localized respiratory disease. In other domestic mammals,
adenovirus infections are associated occasionally  with
enteric or respiratory problems. In Arabian foals with
combined immunodeficiency disease, pulmonary infection
with equine adenovirus A is invariably fatal.

Avian adenoviruses are distributed worldwide and have
been isolated from a wide range of species including
1540
chickens, turkeys, pheasants, pigeons, ducks, quail, geese,
guinea fowl and budgerigars. Infection is extremely
either  subclinical  or associated  with  relatively mild
disease. However, severe disease may follow infection
with certain avian adenoviruses, egg-drop syndrome virus
and turkey adenovirus A. Fowl adenovirus A, also known
as chicken embryo lethal orphan virus (CELO virus, fow]
adenovirus 1), is the type species for avian adenoviruses
and causes quail bronchitis. Fowl adenovirus C (serotype
4) is associated with hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome

This worldwide, generalized, viral disease of dogs, caused
by CAV-l, principally affects the liver and vascular
endothelium. The complete DNA sequence of CAV-1 has
been determined (Morrison et al, 1997).
Epidemiology
Infectious
 canine
hepatitis    has
becomerelatively
uncommon because of the widespread use of effective
vaccines. Although dogs are the most commonly affected
species, foxes, wolves, coyotes, skunks and bears are also
susceptible (Thompson et al., 2010). Transmission can
occur following ingestion of urine, faeces or saliva from
infected animals. The immune response usually eliminates
virus from host tissues by 14 days after initial infection
However, virus may persist in the kidneys and, in some
instances, may be excreted in urine for more than 6
months.
1541
Pathogenesis
Following ingestion, CAV-1 localizes in the tonsils and
Peyer's patches
6(Fig. 63.3).As viraemia develops,
replication  in  vascular endothelium results  in  rapid
distribution of virus throughout the body. Virus replication
also occurs in the parenchymal cells of the liver and
kidneys. Clinical recovery in most dogs coincides with the
production of neutralizing antibodies at about 10 days after
infection. Glomerulonephritis, corneal oedema and anterior
uveitis, attributable to immune complex deposition, may
develop in some infected animals.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 7 days. Dogs of all ages are
susceptible and subclinical infection is common. Clinical
disease is most frequently encountered in young dogs. The
     h    
up to 100% in young pups. In peracute disease, death
occurs so rapidly that poisoning may be suspected. In
acute disease, affected dogs present with fever, depression.
anorexia, increased
1thirst, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Abdominal palpation may elicit pain and, although
hepatomegaly may be detected, jaundice is uncommon.
Corneal opacity, either unilateral or bilateral, may occur
within weeks of clinical recovery in about 20% of affected
animals and usually resolves spontaneously. Recovered
animals have life-long immunity.
Diagnosis
1542
· A history of fever, sudden collapse and abdominal pain in
young, unvaccinated dogs may suggest infectious canine
hepatitis.
· Haematological examination may reveal a marked reduction
in neutrophils and lymphocytes during the febrile stage.
Clotting time may be prolonged.
Kupffer cells and endothelial cells are confirmatory.
·Viral antigen can be demonstrated by immunofluorescence
in cryostat sections of liver.
· PCR methods for detecting viral DNA in clinical specimens
have been described (Kiss et af., 1996; Chouinard et af.,
1998; Hu et al, 2001).
 Suitable specimens for virus isolation in canine kidney cells
include oropharyngeal swabs, blood, urine and faeces from
affected animals sampled during the febrile stage of the
disease. Samples of spleen, lymph nodes and kidney
obtained post mortem are also suitable for virus isolation.
Because of high levels of arginase activity in hepatic tissue,
liver samples are unsuitable for virus isolation as this
enzyme inhibits viral replication in tissue culture.
· A rising antibody titre, detectable using virus neutralization
or haemagglutination inhibition tests, is indicative of active
CAV-1 infection.

Treatment and control
Supportive treatment may allow time for hepatocellular

to counteract dehydration and shock.  In severely ill
animals, blood transfusions may be required to prevent or
control haemorrhage.
Inactivated and modified
1  live vaccines are available.
Occasionally, vaccination
with1
modified live CAV-1
vaccines results in mild nephropathy with shedding of
virus in urine and, in some instances, comeal opacity.
These side effects do not occur with modified live CAV-2
vaccines which stimulate effective long-lasting immunity
to CAV-1. Pups with unknown levels of maternally
derived antibody should be vac-cinated twice, at 8 to 10
weeks and at 12 to 14 weeks of age. Booster injections,
1546
either annually or at intervals of 2 years, are
recommended. Inactivated CAV-1 vaccines, which do not
induce obvious side effects, require boosters at frequent
intervals in order to maintain adequate antibody levels
Infection with canine adenovirus type 2
Canine adenovirus type 2, which is readily transmitted by
aerosols, replicates in both upper and lower respiratory
tract. Clinical signs are generally mild. Affected dogs may
present with clinical signs similar to those of canine
infectious tracheobronchitis (kennel cough). Most dogs
recover and are immune to subsequent challenge. Virus
shedding continues for about 9 days after infection.
Occasional cases of bronchopneumonia may develop due
to  secondary   bacterial  infection.  Diagnosis can  be
confirmed by virus isolation, in situ hybridization and PCR
(Benetka et al., 2006)
Inclusion body hepatitis
Although inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) affects mainly
broilers, it
tsometimes occurs
1m1
pullets. There is
uncertainty about the cause of IBH, and a number of fow]
adenovirus serotypes have been aetiologically
implicated. In affected flocks, a sudden increase in
mortality, which may reach 30%, is a feature of the
disease.  Immunosuppression due to  infectious bursal
disease or chicken anaemia virus infection predisposes to
severe infection and high mortality. Lesions include an
enlarged liver with scattered haemorrhages and necrosis,
intramuscular haemorrhage and anaemia.  Intranuclear
inclusions in hepatocytes are prominent. Diagnosis is
1547
based on characteristic hepatic lesions. Because apparently
healthy birds
excrete
 adenoviruses    and   may   be
serologically positive,  the significance  of positive
serological tests is questionable. As vaccines are not
readily available and the aetiology of IBH is not
definitively established, specific control measures cannot
be formulated.
Egg drop syndrome
A disease referred to as egg drop syndrome, caused by an
adenovirus prevalent in ducks and probably introduced
into chickens through a contaminated vaccine, was first
described in 1976. In flocks, the disease is characterized by
d qon on an Aq o uod a u dop e
production. Infected hens may lay abnormal eggs. Laying
hens up to 36 weeks of age are most commonly affected.
Inflammatory lesions are found in the oviduct, particularly
the pouch shell gland. Intranuclear inclusions may be
present in the epithelial cells of this gland. Samples of
oviduct, including material from the pouch shell gland, are
suitable specimens for virus isolation in avian cell lines,
especially duck kidney or fibroblast cell lines. Virus can
also be detected using ELISA, immunofluorescence or
PCR. As the virus agglutinates avian red cells,
haemagglutination inhibition is the preferred method for
serological screening of flocks. Control of egg drop
syndrome relies on the use of inactivated vaccines before
laying begins. Appropriate hygienic measures combined
with disinfection can be used to limit the spread of
infection. Because of the high risk of cross-infection,
chickens and ducks should be housed separately

Poxviridae
The family Poxviridae contains the largest viruses which
cause disease in domestic animals. Poxvirus symmetry is
complex. The virions in this family are either brick-shaped
(220 to 450nmx140 to 260 nm) with a surface membrane
composed of tubular or globular proteins or ovoid (250 to
300nm x 160 to 190 nm) with a surface membrane
composed of a regular spiral filament (Fig. 64.1 and 64.2).
They contain more than 1oo proteins including several
virus-encoded enzymes. A biconcave core or nucleoid
contains linear double-stranded DNA and one or two
lateral bodies within a surface membrane (Fig. 64.3). A

Infections with

in
vesicular skin lesions (Table 64.1). Smallpox, caused by
variola virus, was formerly a human disease of major
international significance. The use of vaccinia virus for the
1552
prevention of smallpox, first introduced by Jenner in the
late eighteenth century, eventually led to the eradication of
this highly contagious disease at the close of the twentieth
century. Poxviruses code for a large number of proteins
that subvert immune and inflammatory pathways in the
host. These proteins include inhibitors of antiviral
pathways of the cell, anti-apoptotic factors and immune
modulators to modulate host defences against the virus
(Stanford et al, 2007).

Clinical infections
Transmission of poxviruses can occur by aerosols, by
direct contact,
by
 mechanical
transmission
through
arthropods and through fomites. Skin lesions are the
principal feature of these infections. Several virus-encoded
proteins are released from infected cells including a
homologue of epidermal growth factor which stimulates
cell proliferation. Typically, pox lesions begin as macules
and progress through papules, vesicles and pustules to
scabs which detach
leaving

infections.  there  is a  cell-associated

recovered animals have solid immunity. Some localized
pox  infections may

Infections caused by cowpox virus
Cowpox is endemic in parts of Europe. Although infection
and disease have been described in cattle, cats, humans and
a range of mammals in zoos, these species are considered
to be incidental hosts. The reservoir hosts are probably
wild rodents. There is evidence that voles and woodmice
are the principal reservoir hosts in western Europe
(Chantrey et al., 1999). In milking cows, lesions are
usually confined to the teats. The domestic species in
which the disease is most often recognized is the cat.
Affected cats usually come from rural areas and are
described as good
hunters. Moreover, infections in cats tend to peak in the
autumnwhen
small
] rodent
tpopulations  are high,
suggesting rodent-derived infections. Although cat-to-cat
transfer occurs, this mode of transmission is rare. Small
papules on the head or forelimbs, the first recognizable
signs of the infection, eventually ulcerate. Scab formation
is usually followed by complete resolution in about 6
weeks. Secondary skin lesions develop in some cats and a
few animals may show signs of coryza or conjunctivitis.
Rarely, pneumonia and pleural exudation have been
described. Diagnosis can be confirmed by histopathology,
PCR, electron microscopy or virus isolation. No specific
control measures are warranted. Human infections, which
are usually contracted from infected cats, are uncommon.
Infections caused by pseudocowpox virus
1559
Pseudocowpox, also known as milker's nodule, is caused
by pseudocowpox virus, a parapoxvirus with worldwide
distribution. It is a common mild condition affecting the
teats of lactating cows. Infection spreads slowly through
milking herds with variation in the number of affected
animals at any particular time. There is evidence to suggest
that subclinical persistent infection occurs in lymphatic
tissue in cattle (Iketani et al., 2002). Transmission is by
direct or indirect contact. Transfer of infection can occur
through teat cups and on milkers' hands. Transmission can
also occur mechanically by flies or when calves are being
suckled. Small red papules on teats or udder develop into
ulcers with overlying scab formation. Healing at the centre
of the lesions produces characteristic ring-shaped or
horseshoe-shaped  scabs.  Typical  parapoxvirus  particles
can be demonstrated in scab material using electron
microscopy.  Control is based on appropriate hygienic
measures at milking, including the use of effective teat
dips. In human infections, lesions are usually confined to
the hand, forearm or face.
Bovine papular stomatitis
This mild viral disease of young cattle occurs worldwide.
It is caused by a parapoxvirus, bovine papular stomatitis
virus, which is transmitted bv direct or indirect contact
Infection is common and usually subclinical. Mature cattle
are considered to be reservoirs of infection.
Affected calves commonly develop lesions in the buccal
cavity and on the muzzle. These lesions are characterized
by hyperaemic foci that develop into papules with
concentric zones of inflammation. Affected animals
1560
usually recover within 3 weeks. A more severe, chronic
form of the disease, which may be associated with
concurrent infections or immuno-suppression, has been
described (Yeruham et al., 1994). Virions can be
demonstrated in skin scrapings by electron microscopy.
The virus is transmissible to humans.
Orf
This important disease of sheep, also known as contagious
pustular dermatitis or contagious ecthyma, occurs
worldwide and is caused by a parapoxvirus. Goats, camels
and humans are also susceptible to infection
Epidemiology
The virus is transmitted through direct or indirect contact.
Under dry environmental conditions, the virus is stable and
can survive in scab material for months. Infectivity is
substantially reduced after exposure to adverse climatic
conditions. In most flocks, infection is maintained by
sheep with chronic lesions (McKeever and Reid, 1986)
Pathogenesis
The virus, which is epitheliotropic, produces proliferative
wart-like lesions following entry through skin abrasions
such as those acquired from thistles. The virus replicates in
epidermal keratinocytes, and infected cells release a
vascular endothelial growth factor, which stimulates
angiogenesis in the skin (Haig, 2006). The virus encodes a
number of factors that interfere with inflammation and the
local immune response including a homologue of
1561
interleukin 10, a chemokine binding protein and a
granulocyte-macrophage  colony  
 stimulating  factor/
interleukin 2 binding protein (Fleming and Mercer, 2007).
Papular lesions progress to vesicles, pustules and
eventually scab formation. Proliferation of cells underlying
scabs produces verrucose masses. In the absence of
secondary bacterial infection, lesions usually heal within 4
weeks.
Clinical signs
The disease primarily affects young sheep. The incubation
period is up to 7 days. Although lesions most often occur
on the commissures of the lips and on the muzzle, they
may also develop in the mouth and on the feet, genitalia
and teats. Mild lesions may go unnoticed. Severely
affected lambs with lesions in the buccal cavity often fail
to eat, lose condition and may
die. Outbreaks last for some months and vary in severity
from farm to farm and from year to year. The disease does
not usually recur until the birth of new susceptible lambs
in the flock. Although isolates from individual flocks can
differ in genotype, there is no evidence that the severity of
the disease correlates with the strain of the virus involved
(Gilray et al., 1998). Environmental management factors
may influence the outcome of infection (Gumbrell and
McGregor, 1997). Concurrent bacterial infection with
oedema of the head and swelling of the tongue, which
could be confused with bluetongue, has been described.
Immunity following natural infection may not confer
complete protection, due in part to virus immunomodulator
proteins that interfere with host immune responses (Haig
1562
and McInnes, 2002). However, lesions in animals
previously affected are usually less severe and heal more
rapidly than those developing after first exposure. In
chronically infected sheep, lesions may be either mild or
proliferative.Immunity  to  the  virus requires
a
cell-mediated immune (CMI) response and neonatal lambs
are susceptible to infection despite receipt of colostrum
from previously infected ewes.
Diagnosis
Lesions of orf are readily recognized by their characteristic
appearance  and  distribution.  Virus  present  in  lesion
material can be identified by electron microscopy. Primers
are available for the detection of parap-oxvirus DNA in
clinical specimens (Kottaridi et al., 2006).
Treatment and control
There is no specific treatment for infection with orf virus
Antibiotic therapy reduces the effect of secondary bacterial
infection in young lambs.
In endemically infected flocks, control is based on the use
of a fully virulent live vaccine derived from scab material
or cell culture. Ewes should be vaccinated by scarification
in the axilla at least 8 weeks before lambing. When close
to lambing, they must be moved to a new grazing area in
order to minimize exposure of lambs to infectious vaccinal
scab material. Lambs should be vaccinated only if an
outbreak occurs in a flock. If carried out effectively,
thorough  cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and
1563
equipment between periods of housing may reduce the
amount of residual virus in buildings.
Humans are susceptible to infection with orf virus
Typically, a single lesion occurs on hands, forearms or
face. Care should be exercised when handling infected
sheep and when using live vaccines.
Sheeppox and goatpox
Both of these diseases are endemic in south-eastern
Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The viruses of
sheeppox and goatpox are members of the genus
Capripoxvirus. A range of capripoxvirus strains have been
isolated from sheep and goats and there is evidence of
recombination between strains (Gershon et al., 1989).
Although some strains are extremely pathogenic in both
sheep and goats, other strains produce severe disease in
only one of these species. Recent genetic studies suggest
that sheeppox virus and goatpox virus are phylogenetically
distinct viruses (Tulman et al., 2002 ).
Epidemiology
Virus particles are shed from skin lesions and in ocular and
nasal discharges during the acute stages of the disease.
Infection occurs through skin abrasions or by aerosol.
Biting insects may also transmit the virus mechanically.
Housing or stockading animals facilitates transmission of
the virus. Following infection, capripoxvirus strains induce
immunity. In endemic areas, where indigenous animals
frequently have a high level of naturally acquired
1564
immunity, generalized disease and mortality are rare. In
isolated flocks, outbreaks of severe disease may occur.
Pathogenesis and pathology
The virus replicates locally either in the skin or in the
lungs. Spread to the regional lymph nodes is followed by
viraemia and replication in various internal organs. Skin
lesions, typical of poxvirus infection, appear about 7 days
post infection. Lung lesions present as multiple nodular
areas of consolidation.
Clinical signs
Following an incubation period of about 1 week, infected
animalsdevelop
fever, oedema of theeyelids.
conjunctivitis and nasal discharge. Within a few days,
macules which rapidly develop into papules appear on the
skin and external mucous membranes. Scabs form over
necrotic papules. The severity of the clinical signs depends
on the breed, age, immune status and nutritional status of
the host animal as well as the strain and virulence of the
infecting capripoxvirus. Lesions in mild afebrile disease
may be minimal and confined to the skin beneath the tail.
Mortality rates with infections from some strains of
capripoxvirus may be up to 5o% even in indigenous
breeds. The disease is most severe in young animals and in
imported breeds. In some European breeds, which are
extremely susceptible, mortality rates may approach 100%.
Secondary bacterial infection or dissemination of the virus
to other sites may result in a severe form of the disease.
1565

virus. Several modified live
evaccinesareavailable
including a Kenyan sheeppox strain used in sheep and
goats, a Romanian strain used in sheep, and the Mysore
strain used in goats. A subunit vaccine has also been
developed (Carn et al., 1994). Inactivated vaccines are not
recommended as they are less effective than modified live
1566
vaccines
 because  cell-mediated
immunity is the
predominant protective response.
Capripoxviruses are being employed as  vectors  for
important ruminant viral vaccines (Romero et al., 1993).
These vector vaccines may provide protection against
diseases caused by capripoxviruses as well as diseases
such as rinderpest and peste des petits ruminants.
Lumpy skin disease
This acute disease of cattle.  which is endemic in
sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, is caused by lumpy
skin disease virus (Neethling virus), a capripoxvirus.
Outbreaks have also occurred in Egypt and Israel.
Epidemiology
Although virus is present in the saliva of infected animals
and  transmission  may   occur  through  environmental
contamination, lumpy skin disease is not particularly
contagious (Carn and Kitching, 1995-. The principal
method of transmission is by mechanical transfer through
biting insects (Chihota et al., 200l). As a consequence,
disease outbreaks usually occur during the rainy season
when insect activity is high and epidemics are often
associated with heavy rainfall. New outbreaks may appear
in areas far removed from an initial outbreak. It is unclear
how the virus persists between epidemics but subclinically
infected cattle are probably important. A wildlife reservoir,
possibly the African Cape buffalo, may be involved.
Pathogenesis and pathology
1567
Virus, which is transmitted mechanically by biting insects.
rapidly  disseminates  through  a   leukocyte-associated
viraemia. Many cell
1   types  including  kerati-nocytes,
myocytes, fibrocytes and endothelial cells become
infected. Damage to endothelial cells, which results in
vasculitis,  thrombosis,   infarction,  oedema
aand
inflammatory cell infiltration, accounts for the nodular
skin lesions.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 14 days. There is a
persistent
t fever accompanied by lacrimation, nasal
discharge and a drop in milk yield. Superficial lymph
nodes become enlarged and there is oedema of the limbs
and dependent tissues. Circumscribed skin nodules
develop particularly on the head, neck, udder and
perineum. Nodules also develop on the mucous
membranes of the mouth and nares. Some skin lesions may
develop into ^sit-fasts'. These structures are composed of a
central plug of necrotic tissue which sloughs leaving a
deep ulcer. Secondary bacterial infection or myiasis can
exacerbate the condition. Recovery may take several
months. Affected animals are often debilitated and
pregnant cows may abort. The severity of the disease
relates to the strain of virus and the breed of cattle
Domestic breeds (Bos taurus) are more susceptible than
zebu (Bos indicus) cattle. Some animals
have few skin lesions and no systemic reaction while
others display the full spectrum of clinical signs. Although
the mortality rate is usually less than 5%, the economic
impact of the disease can be considerable.

Control

for the control of lumpy skin disease, one based on a South
African strain of lumpy skin disease virus and the other on
a Kenyan strain of sheeppox virus. A recombinant vaccine
providing protection against lumpy  skin disease and
rinderpest has been developed (Romero et al., 1993).
Imported cattle should be vaccinated before introduction
into high-risk areas. Surveillance and eradication policies
are appropriate control measures in countries bordering on
endemic regions (Yeruham et al., 1995)
Swinepox
This disease, which occurs worldwide, is mild and often
goes unrecognized. Swinepox virus is the sole member of
1569
the  genus Suipoxvirus.  The  virus  is transmitted
mechanically by the pig louse, Haematopinus suis.
Following an incubation period of about 1 week, infected
animals display a slight fever and rash. Papules and
pustules with scab formation resolve within 3 to 4 weeks.
These skin lesions are similar to those which occur in pigs
infected with vaccinia virus. Virus particles can be
demonstrated in material from the lesions by electron
microscopy. A vaccine is not available although there is
interest in the use of swinepox virus as a vaccine vector.
Control within a herd can be achieved by improved
hygiene together with louse eradication.
Fowlpox
This disease, which affects domestic poultry, including
chickens and turkeys, is caused by infection with fowlpox
virus. The infection is slow-spreading and characterized by
proliferative skin lesions and diphtheritic lesions in the
upper digestive and respiratory tracts. Fowl pox has a
worldwide distribution.
Epidemiology
Fowlpox, pigeonpox and turkeypox viruses are closely
related and are not strictly host-specific. Several avian
species are susceptible to infection with fowlpox virus.
Transmission occurs by contact and by mechanical transfer
on the mouthparts
of biting
 arthropods, particularly
mosquitoes. Virus enters the body through abrasions on
unfeathered skin, on oral mucosa or on respiratory mucosa.
Aerosols generated from scab material may result in
transmission by inhalation. There is evidence that the virus
1570
may persist in some birds with reactivation occurring as a
result of stress or immunosuppression.
Pathogenesis
Virus multiplication occurs at the site of introduction and
may be confined to that site when the strain of infecting
virus is of low virulence. Infections caused bv virulent
strains result in viraemia with replication in internal
organs.  The route of introduction influences the
distribution and severity of lesions. Factors such as
malnutrition, debilitation and stress may contribute to the
severity of the disease.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 14 days. Two forms of
fowlpox have been described, a cutaneous form (dry pox)
and a diphtheritic form (wet pox). In the cutaneous form.
nodular lesions develop on the comb, wattles and other
unfeathered areas of skin. Progression to vesicle formation
is followed by ulceration and scab formation. Healing
occurs within 2 weeks. In severely affected birds, lesions
may involve both feathered and unfeathered areas of skin
and involvement of the eyelids may lead to complete
closure. In the diphtheritic form of the disease, yellowish
necrotic lesions (cankers) develop on the mucous
membranes of the mouth, oesophagus and trachea. Oral
lesions may
interfere with eating. Tracheal involvement may lead to
laboured breathing and rales.
1571
The mortality rate, which is higher in birds with the
diphtheritic form than the cutaneous form, may approach
50% in severe outbreaks, particularly when accompanied
by  secondary  bacterial  or  fungal  infection.  Economic
losses are largely due to a transient drop in egg production
in laying birds and reduced growth in young birds
Diagnosis
Large intracytoplasmic inclusions  (Bollinger bodies)
containing small elementary bodies (Borrel bodies) may be
demonstrable in epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence and
immunoperoxidase techniques can be used to identify viral
antigen in intracyto-plasmic inclusions.
Typical poxvirus particles can be demonstrated by electron
microscopy in material from lesions.
·Virus may be isolated on the chorioallantoic membrane of 9
to 12-day-old embryonated eggs.
· Nucleic acid probes can be used for diagnosis. Alternatively,
viral DNA can be amplified by PCR using specific primers
(Lee and Lee, 1997)
·Suitableserological
tests

Treatment and control
There is no specific treatment. Control of secondary
bacterial infection is desirable. In endemic areas, improved
management and hygiene along with regular vaccination
have reduced the effect of the disease on commercial
poultry production. Modified live fowlpox or pigeonpox
virus vaccines, produced in tissue culture or chick embryo.
are available commercially. Chickens are usually
vaccinated at about 1 month of age. Recombinant vaccines
1572
employing fowlpox and canarypox viruses are being
developed for use not only in birds but also in mammalian
species. Although fowlpox virus can enter mammalian
cells and expresses proteins, it is unable to replicate.
Myxomatosis
This severe generalized disease of European rabbits is
caused by myxoma virus, the type species of the genus
Leporipoxvirus.
Epidemiology
The natural hosts of myxoma virus are New World species
of rabbits, Sylvilagus brasiliensis in South America and S.
bachmani in California. Infection has long been endemic
in South America and western North America. In natural
hosts, myxoma virus infection causes a benign cutaneous
fibroma. In contrast, infection in the European rabbit
(Oryctolagus cunicu- lus) is lethal. During the 1950s South
American isolates of myxoma virus were introduced into
populations of O. cuniculus in Europe, Chile and Australia
as a method for controlling rabbit numbers. More than
99% of infected rabbits died and the disease is now
endemic in these regions. Both attenuated virus strains and
resistant rabbit populations have emerged.  Virus is
transmitted mechanically on the mouthparts of mosquitoes
and fleas. Epidemics, which may occur annually, relate to
the presence of arthropod vectors and large numbers of
young susceptible rabbits
Pathogenesis and pathology
1573
Virus replicates at the site of inoculation and in regional
lymph nodes and the subsequent viraemia is mainly
cell-associated, with most virus particles in lymphocytes.
Gelatinous, myxoma-like swellings are evident in the skin
about 1 week after infection.
Clinical signs
Subcutaneous  gelatinous  swellings are
particularly
prominent
inthe head
1  and
[anogenital
areas.
Blepharoconjunctivitis develops, accompanied by an
opalescent ocular discharge. Affected animals are febrile
and listless, and some may die within 48 hours. Activation
of Pasteurella multocida infection can result in nasal
discharge. The mortality rate, which ranges from 25% to
90%, is influenced by the genetic resistance of the rabbit
population and the virulence of the virus strain. Low
ambient temperatures increase the severity of the disease.
Diagnosis
The clinical signs are characteristic. Isolation of virus or
detection of poxvirus particles in exudate or in material
from lesions by electron microscopy is confirmatory.
Control
Commercial and laboratory rabbit stocks can be protected
by vaccination with modified live myxoma virus or with
rabbit fbroma (Shope fibroma)  virus, a  related
Leporipoxvirus. Control of flea infestation in colonies and
insect proofing of accommodation to reduce transmission
1574
of infection by other arthropods may be necessary in
endemic areas.

Asfarviridae
African swine fever virus (ASFV), formerly assigned to
the family Iridoviridae, has been reassigned to a newly
created family, Asfarviridae, containing the single genus
Asfivirus. African swine fever virus is the type species of
s  n mo o a s  s 
by arthropods. The virus has similarities in genome
structure and method of replication to poxviruses but is
different in other respects. Virions are 175 to 215 nm in
diameter and consist of a membrane-bound nucleoprotein
lipid-containing envelope (Fig. 65.1). This complex virus
contains more than 50 proteins, including a large number
of structural proteins and several virus-encoded enzymes
required for transcription
 and
post-translational
modification of mRNA. The genome consists of a single
molecule of linear double-stranded DNA. Following
replication in the cytoplasm of host cells, virus is released
either by budding through the plasma membrane or
following cellular disintegration. African swine fever virus
is stable in the environment over a wide range of
temperature (4°C to 20°C) and pH values. The virus may
persist for months in meat. Infectivity can be destroyed by
disinfectants such as orthophenylphenol, formalin and
halogen compounds
African swine fever
1580
African swine fever (ASF) is an economically important
viral disease of pigs, characterized by fever, haemorrhages
in many tissues and a high mortality rate. It is endemic in
sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar and Sardinia. Outbreaks
have occurred in Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands, Russia,
Malta, Brazil, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
The Iberian Peninsula was declared free of the disease in
1995, almost 30 years after initial introduction into the
region, but ASFV reappeared in 1999 in Portugal. It has
been eradicated from South America and the Caribbean.
Key points
· Enveloped DNA virus
·  Icosahedral symmetry
· Replicates in cytoplasm of host cells and in soft
ticks of the Ornithodorus species
Causes African swine fever
Epidemiology
Domestic and wild pigs are the only species susceptible to
infection. In Africa, ASFV is maintained in a sylvatic
cycle involving soft ticks of the genus Ornithodorus and
inapparent infection of warthogs and bushpigs (Fig. 65.2).
Adult warthogs with persistent inapparent infection rarely
develop viraemia. In contrast, young warthogs develop
viraemia and are a major source of virus for soft ticks.
Replication of virus occurs in the ticks and both
transovarial   and  transstadial  transmission  have  been
described. Soft ticks
1581
feed for short periods on hosts before dropping off and
sheltering in crevices in walls or cracks in the ground. As
ticks are able to maintain and transmit the virus to pigs for
years, the presence of ticks in a particular region makes the
eradication of ASF difficult. The principal tick species
involved in transmission are O. porcinus porcinus (O.
moubata) in Africa (Kleiboeker et al., 1998) and O.
erraticus in Spain and Portugal. Experimentally, several
other Ornithodorus  species  support  virus replication.
Virulent strains of ASFV, producing high mortality in
infected animals, are widely distributed in Africa. Many
isolates from other parts of the world are less virulent and
mortality rates are usually below 5o%.
Following infection of domestic pigs with virulent virus,
body fluids and tissues contain large quantities of virus
until death or recovery occurs. Ingestion of uncooked meat
from infected warthogs or domestic pigs is a major method
of transmission. Spread can also occur by direct contact
usually through oral or nasal secretions. Occasionally,
animals become infected by contact with blood shed as a
result of fighting. Indirect transmission can occur through
contaminated transport vehicles, fomites and footwear.
Feeding uncooked swill is an important mechanism of
spread of ASF internationally, with outbreaks often
starting in herds close to airports and ports.
Pigs which have recovered from clinical disease may
remain infected for long periods. Carrier pigs are
considered to be important sources of virus dissemination.
Although recovered  pigs  are  clinically  unaffected by
challenge with genotypically related ASFV, the challenge
virus may replicate and spread to other pigs.

Pathogenesis and pathology
Infection in domestic pigs is usually acquired via the
oronasal route. The virus replicates initially in pharyngeal
mucosa, tonsils and the regional lymph nodes. Infection
then spreads by the bloodstream to other lymph nodes,
bone marrow, spleen, lung, liver and kidneys. Secondary
replication in these sites results in prolonged viraemia.
Although the virus replicates primarily in cells of the
lymphoreticular system, it can also infect megakaryocytes.

subcapsular petechiation in the kidneys, petechial and
ecchymotic haemorrhages on serosal surfaces, oedema of
the lungs and hydrothorax. The widespread haemorrhages
result
t from 
disseminated
[  intravascular
coagulation,
endothelial damage and destruction of megakaryocytes
(Rodriguez et al., 1996). Leukopenia is marked. Because
the virus does not appear to replicate in T and B
lymphocytes, it has been suggested that the lymphopenia
1584
and necrosis of lymphoid organs follows apoptosis of
lymphocytes induced
[ by    proinflammatory    cytokines
(Carrasco et al., 1996; Salguero et al, 2005). Lesions in
chronic disease include pneumonia, fibrinous pleuritis and
pericarditis, pleural adhesions and hyperplasia of
lymphoreticular tissues.
Clinical signs
The clinical signs of ASF, which range from inapparent to
peracute, relate to the challenge dose and virulence of the
virus and to the route of infection. The incubation period.
which may extend from 4 to 19 days, is typically 5 to 7
days in acute cases. Animals with peracute disease die
suddenlywithout
t premonitory clinical signs. Fever.
inappetence, depression and recumbency are features of
acute disease. Cutaneous hyperaemia and, in some cases,
haemorrhages may
be
evident.  Other signs include
dyspnoea, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea, bleeding from the nose
and rectum, and abortion. The mortality rate is high.
Subacute disease has a course of 3 to 4 weeks. Clinical
signs include pneumonia, swollen joints, emaciation,
depression and inappetence. Mortality rates, which are
variable, depend on the age and general health of infected
pigs. Animals may recover clinically or may develop a
chronic form of the disease, which usually occurs in
regions whereASFVisendemic.The
immune
mechanisms responsible for recovery and protection from
ASFV are poorly understood. Neutralizing antibodies are
not demonstrable in the sera of recovered animals.
Cell-mediated immunity is considered to be an important
component of the immune response.
1585
Diagnosis
Laboratory confirmation of ASF is mandatory because the
clinical signs and lesions, which occur in some other
important pig diseases such as classical swine fever,
erysipelas and septicaemic salmonellosis, are similar.
· Suitable samples for laboratory examination include blood,
serum, tonsil, spleen and lymph nodes.
· The most convenient and frequently used test for detection
of ASFV is the PCR. Direct immunofluorescence, which is
fast and economical, can be carried out on impression
smears or cryostat sections. However, the sensitivity of the
test is only 40% in pigs with subacute or chronic ASF
because of the blocking action of bound antibodyin
antigen-antibody complexes. Most field strains of ASFV
induce haemadsorption. Pig erythrocytes adhere to the
surface of infected monocytes and macrophages, forming a
characteristic rosette. The haemadsorption test can be carried
out by employing leukocytes from blood samples of pigs
under investigation or by inoculating primary blood
leukocyte cultures with blood or homogenized tissue from
suspect pigs.
· The polymerase chain reaction is used to detect DNA from
ASFV in tissues (Aguero et al., 2003; King et al., 2003 )
·Antibodies persist for long periods in recovered animals.
Serological testing may be the only means of detecting
animals infected with strains of low virulence. Techniques
for detecting antibodies to ASF include ELISA and
immunoblotting.
Control
A successful vaccine is not yet available. Inactivated
vaccines do not induce protection.   Although  live
attenuated vaccines induce protection against challenge
with homologous virus strains in some pigs, a proportion
1586
of these animals become carriers and may develop chronic
lesions.
Countries maintain disease-free  status by prohibiting
importation of pigs and pig products. Waste food scraps
from aircraft and ships must be boiled before inclusion in
pig feed. In the face of an outbreak of ASF in countries
free of infection, an eradication policy is implemented.
The occurrence of low virulence strains renders eradication
difficult.
Restriction of pig movement, serological monitoring of
carrier pigs and prevention of contact between domestic
pigs and warthogs or ticks are important control measures
in countries where the disease is endemic. Eradication of
tick species which act as
vectors of ASFV is an essential part of a control
programme.

Parvoviridae
Viruses belonging to the family Parvoviridae, referred to
as parvoviruses, are small (Latin parvus, small) and range
in size from 18 to 26 nm in diameter (Fig. 66.1). These
non-enveloped, icosahedral  viruses possess a  linear
genome of single-stranded DNA. There are two
sub-families: Parvovirinae, which includes viruses of
vertebrates, and Densovirinae, viruses of arthropods. Of
the five genera within the subfamily Parvovirinae (Fig.
66.2), the genus Parvovirus contains viruses which are of
particular veterinary importance.
Parvoviruses replicate only in the nuclei of dividing host
cells, a feature which determines the tissues targeted. After
entering a cell, the virion is uncoated and its
single-stranded    DNA   genome    is   converted   to
double-stranded DNA by cellular DNA polymerases in the
nucleus. Following viral replication, cell lysis occurs as
virions are released.
Parvoviruses are stable in the environment. They are
resistant to many factors including lipid solvents, a wide
range of pH values (pH 3 to 9) and heating at 56°C for
more than 60 minutes. They are inactivated by formalin.
beta-propiolactone, sodium hypochlorite and oxidizing
agents. With the exception of Aleutian mink disease virus
and
dgoose parvovirus, parvoviruses of vertebrates
agglutinate erythrocytes. Hae-magglutination inhibition
(HAI) by specific antisera is widely used for the
1589
identification of these viruses. Mink enteritis virus, canine
parvovirus and racoon parvovirus are considered to be
host-range mutants of feline panleukopenia virus.

Clinical infections
Parvoviruses can infect many domestic and wild animals
(Table 66.1). Although most members of the group
produce acute systemic diseases, some such as canine
minute virus and  bovine parvovirus are of uncertain
pathogenic significance. Two distinct
parvoviral diseases of mink, Aleutian mink disease and
mink enteritis, are recognized. Mink enteritis, first
described in the 1940s, affects kits and clinically resembles
1590
feline panleukopenia. Aleutian mink disease is a persistent
infection, primarily  affecting
animalswhichare
homozygous for pale coat colour.  The disease is
characterized by  B lymphocyte stimulation leading to
plasmacytosis, hypergammaglobulinaemia and immune
complex- related lesions in the kidneys and other organs
Aleutian mink disease can also occur in domestic ferrets
(Welchman et al., 1993). Goose parvovirus infection,
A        
contagious and often fatal. A related virus, duck
parvovirus, causes a similar disease in Muscovy ducks.
Both viruses are related to adeno-associated viruses but do
not require a helper virus for productive replication. The
most important parvoviral diseases of domestic mammals
are feline panleukopenia, canine parvovirus infection and
porcine parvovirus infection.

Feline panleukopenia
Feline panleukopenia, also known as feline infectious
enteritis or feline distemper, is a highly contagious
generalized disease of domestic and wild cats caused by
feline panleukopenia virus. Only one serotype of this virus
has been identified. The disease, which is worldwide in
distribution, is one of the most common feline viral
infections.

Pathogenesis and pathology
Following ingestion or inhalation, replication occurs in the
mitotically active lymphoid tissues of the oropharynx and
associated lymph nodes. Viraemia develops within 24
hours, producing infection of mitotically active cells in
other tissues, particularly the cells of the intestinal crypts
and the lymphopoietic cells of the bone marrow, thymus.
ymph nodes and spleen. Destruction of these target tissues
results in panleukopenia and villous atrophy. The crypts of
1594
Lieberkuhn are dilated and contain necrotic epithelial cells
Intranuclear inclusions are sometimes evident in crypt
cells. Intestinal villi become blunted and may fuse. The
effects of transplacental infection on foetuses generally
relate to the stage of gestation at which viral infection
occurs. Infection early in gestation usually leads to
abortion or resorption; viral invasion later in gestation may
result in cerebellar hypoplasia, retinal dysplasia or early
neonatal death.
Clinical signs
The incubation period of feline panleukopenia ranges from
2 to 10 days but is typically 4 to 5 days. Subclinical
       o  
leukopenia, usually followed by life-long immunity.
Subacute disease presents as depression, fever and
diarrhoea lasting 1 to 3 days, followed by rapid recovery.
The disease is most severe in young, unvaccinated kittens
between 6 and 24 weeks of age and is characterized by
sudden onset of pronounced depression, anorexia and
fever. Vomiting, sometimes accompanied by diarrhoea or
dysentery, follows within 2 days
and can result in severe dehydration and electrolyte
imbalance. Abdominal pain may be evident. The mortality
rate ranges from 25 to 90%, with most deaths occurring
within 3 to 5 days of the onset of illness. Animals which
survive require several weeks for full recovery. Immunity
is strong and long-lasting. Subnormal temperatures are
followed by death within 24 hours. Although intrauterine
infection of the developing foetuses often occurs, infected
pregnant queens usually show no signs of illness. Foetal
infections early in gestation may result in resorption or
1595
abortion.  Because
  of developing foetal
 immune
competence, infections after mid-gestation are usually less
severe. However, stillbirths, early neonatal death and
teratological changes such as cerebellar hypoplasia and
retinal dysplasia may occur in the litters of queens infected
during late pregnancy. Kittens with cerebellar hypoplasia

- Appropriate fluid therapy for dehydration should be given.
-Wholeblood or plasma fromimmune donors maybe

supplemented with B complex vitamins.
Control
Immunity following natural infection  is strong and
long-lasting. Vaccination is the principal control measure.
·Modified live and inactivated vaccines are commercially
available:
- Inactivated vaccines are less effective than modified live
vaccines and require booster inoculations. They are safe for
pregnant queens and might be considered for vaccination of
Siamese and Burmese kittens which can have adverse
reactions to modified live vaccines (Carwardine, 1990 ).
Modified live vaccines can be used to immunize kittens at
8 to 10 weeks of age, with a booster dose at 12 to 14 weeks

Canine parvovirus infection
Infection with canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged in the
late 1970s as a worldwide disease in dogs with
high morbidity and mortality. Acute or subacute heart
failure in pups infected in utero or during the perinatal
period was a common manifestation of the disease. With
the gradual development of immunity in the adult dog
population as a consequence of both natural exposure and
vaccination, the clinical pattern of the disease changed
Themostcommon
clin1cal
presentationcurrently
encountered is acute enteric disease in young dogs
between weaning and 6 months of age. Since the
appearance of CPV in 1978, further mutations affecting the
genome and antigenicity of the virus have occurred and
three subtypes of the virus are currently recognized,
CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c (Truyen, 2006). Infection or
vaccination with one subtype generally confers immunity
against the other subtypes, but there have been calls to
incorporate recent field strains in the vaccines (Decaro et
1598
al., 2009 ). Canine parvovirus is believed to have evolved
from FPV as a result of five or six amino acid changes in
the capsid protein gene, which permitted the virus to bind
to the transferrin receptor on canine cells. Canine
parvovirus infections in cats appear to be rare. Canine
parvovirus is now classified as a strain of FPV.
Epidemiology
Many canine species are susceptible to infection and
transmission is predominantly by the faecal-oral route.
Infected dogs shed large numbers of viruses in their faeces.
The number of viruses in faeces may be 10%/g from the
fifth or sixth day after infection. Persistent shedding is
uncommon and the continued presence of the disease in
dog populations depends mainly on the stability of the
virus in the environment. The low dose of virus required to
establish infection and the ease with which mechanical
transfer can take place are important additional factors
contributing to the spread of infection.
Pathogenesis and pathology
The  virus replicates  initially  in  pharyngeal lymphoid
tissues and Peyer's patches. Once viraemia develops, the
main target tissues are those with rapidly multiplying cell
populations. During the first 2 weeks of life there is active
division of cardiac myocytes allowing viral replication
with resultant necrosis and myocarditis. In older pups, the
virus invades the actively dividing epithelial cells of the
crypts in the small intestine. Loss of cells from the
intestinal crypts leads to blunting of villi, with resultant
reduced absorptive and digestive capacity, leading to
1599
diarrhoea. There may be extensive haemorrhage into the
intestinal lumen in severely affected pups. Destruction of
lym-phoid tissues of the intestinal mucosa and mesenteric
lymph nodes contributes to immunosuppression  which
allows proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria with
secondary  invasion  of  damaged intestinal tissues.
Endotoxaemia, leading to endotoxic shock, may follow in
some instances.
Clinical signs
The age and the immune status of the animal largely
determine the form and severitv of the disease. After a
short incubation period of 4 to 7 days, animals with enteric
disease show sudden onset of vomiting and anorexia.
Depression and fever may also be observed. Diarrhoea,
often blood-stained, develops within 48 hours, and in
severe cases there may be frank haemorrhage. The faeces
have a foetid smell. Concurrent intestinal parasitism and
viral or bacterial infections may exacerbate the condition.
Affected dogs deteriorate rapidly due to dehydration and
weight loss. Prolonged illness is uncommon; severely
affected animals die within 3 days. Animals which survive
the disease develop a long-lasting immunity
In the myocardial form of the disease, which is now rare,
affected pups usually show signs of acute heart failure
before 8 weeks of age. Some pups may develop congestive
heart failure months after the initial infection as a result of
extensive fibrosis following myocardial necrosis

· Dogs with subacute or chronic heart failure may improve

Control
Vaccination alone usually cannot control the cycle of
endemic parvovirus infection in kennels and therefore it is
important to minimize exposure of pups to the virus until
they reach 20 weeks of age (Pollock and Coyne, 1993).
Non-protective, low levels of maternal antibody can
interfere with the efficacy of some modified live vaccines.
In many pups, these critical levels last until 8 to 12 weeks
of age, but in some instances interference with vaccination
may continue until 18 weeks of age (O'Brien, 1994).
·  Inactivated and modified live vaccines are commercially
available:
 Inactivated vaccines usually provide protection for up to 1
year and are safe to use in pregnant bitches.
   s    
long-lasting protection, annual boosters may be required.
These vaccines should not be used for pregnant bitches.
Modified live vaccines vary in their degree of viral
attenuation. The less attenuated strains of vaccinal viruses
can replicate in pups despite the presence of residual
maternal antibodies (Churchill, 1987; Burtonboy et af.,
1991) and vaccination of pups at 12 weeks of age is often
claimed by vaccine manufacturers to be protective.
·Thorough disinfection of premises must be carried out
following a disease outbreak:
- Effective disinfectants include 1% sodium hypochlorite
and 2% formalin.
1602
- Fumigation with formaldehyde gas, where feasible, is the
most efficient disinfection procedure.
Porcine parvovirus infection
Porcine parvovirus is an important cause of reproductive
failure in pigs. The virus, which occurs as a single
serotype, is found worldwide and infection is endemic in
many conventional pig herds.
Epidemiology
On farms where the disease is endemic, many sows are
transmit passive protection through colostrum to their
piglets. Maternally-derived immunity usually persists for
about 4 months, but it can persist in some pigs until they
are 6 to 9 months of age. During this period, the
maternally-derived antibodies may
interferewiththe
development of active immunity and consequently some
gilts can be seronegative and susceptible to infection at
mating. Infected pigs shed virus in their faeces and other
secretions, including semen, for only a few weeks
However, pens may remain contaminated for several
months because of the exceptional stability of the virus.
Pathogenesis
After infection by the oronasal route and occasionally
through semen, local replication of virus is followed by
viraemia. The virus has a predilection for the mitotically
active cells of foetal tissues. Transplacental infection in
pregnant sows occurs 10 to 14 days after exposure to the
1603
virus. The major damage to foetuses arises before onset of
immunological competence, at about 60 to 70 days of
gestation (Huysman et al., 1992). Infection of embryos in
the first weeks of life results in death and resorption. When
infection occurs later in gestation, but before day 70,
foetuses die and become mummified. Infection after 70
days of gestation usually results in the birth of healthy
seropositive piglets.
Clinical signs
Porcine parvovirus infection is a major cause of SMEDI.
an acronym used to describe porcine reproductive failure
in which stillbirths, mummified foetuses, early embryonic
death and infertility (SMEDI) occur. Abortion and
neonatal   deaths   have
  been  reported   occasionally.
Generally, small litters with
mummified
1 piglets of different sizes are produced
following
 transplacental   infection    and
subsequent
sequential exposure of foetuses by intrauterine spread. If
the number of viable embryos is reduced below four, the
entire litter is typically lost. Infection with porcine
parvovirus does not appear to damage the male
reproductive tract.
Diagnosis
·When reproductive failure is detected in young or recently
introduced sows, particularly if associated with mummified
foetuses, infection with porcine parvovirus must be
considered.
· Several foetuses should be submitted for laboratory
examination.
1604
· Demonstration of viral antigen in cryostat sections of foetal
tissues by immunofluorescence, particularly in lung tissue, is
reliable and sensitive.
· Agglutination of guinea-pig erythrocytes by homogenates of 
foetal tissue indicates the presence of viral haemagglutinin.
 Swine kidney cell lines may be used for virus isolation.
However, viral infectivity is gradually lost following death
of the foetus, and isolation from mummified tissues may be
uns uccessful.
· PCR assays have been used for the detection of viral DNA in
foetal tissues (Gradil et al., 1994).
·SerologicaltechniquesincludeHAIandVNtests.
Antibodies may be detected in sera or body fluids of older
foetuses or aborted piglets. However, serological testing of
the sow's serum is usually of little diagnostic value in
infected herds.
Control
Control in herds in which the disease is endemic is based
on exposure of gilts and susceptible sows to porcine
parvovirus prior to mating, thereby inducing immunity.
Vaccination can be used to enhance immunity in herds
with endemic disease. It can also be used for male or
female breeding stock introduced into these herds
Natural exposure can be achieved by increasing the contact
between susceptible gilts and older seropositive sows.
Methods of stimulating immunity include exposing animals
to contaminated faeces or to placental or foetal tissue from
infected sows.
· Modified live and inactivated vaccines against the single
serotype of porcine parvovirus have been developed
commercially. Gilts and susceptible seronegative sows and
boars should be vaccinated 2 to 4 weeks before mating.
Vaccination prevents intrauterine infection for a limited
1605
period.  Most  vaccination  strategies rely  on subsequent
natural exposure to the virus to reinforce immunity
(Huysman et af., 1992 ).

Circoviridae
Viruses in the family Circoviridae cause disease in
vertebrate animals and plants. Circoviruses (17 to 22 nm in
diameter) are non-enveloped with icosahedral symmetry
(Fig. 67.1). They are stable in the environment at pH 3 to
pH 9 and are resistant to heating at 60°C for 30 minutes.
The genome consists of a molecule of circular single-
stranded DNA. Replication occurs in the nuclei of dividing
cells.  Genetic
C sequencing studies
ssuggestedthat
circoviruses fell into three groups (Niagro et al., 1998) and
this is reflected in recent classification changes. Chicken
anaemia virus (22nm in diameter), the type species, has
been assigned to the newly- created genus, Gyrovirus. The
animal circoviruses (17 nm in diameter), porcine
circovirus and beak and feather disease virus, have been
assigned to the genus Circovirus. The third grouping
contains plant viruses which have now been assigned to
the family Nanoviridae.
Clinical infections
Circoviruses,  which  are host-specific  and have a
worldwide distribution, infect cells of the haemolym-
phatic system. Infections with chicken anaemia virus and
with porcine circovirus are of veterinary interest. Beak and
feather disease virus is associated with a debilitating,
immunosuppressive disease of young psittacine birds,
particularly cockatoos.

Chicken anaemia virus infection
Young birds infected with chicken anaemia virus (CAV)
develop aplastic anaemia and generalized lym- phoid
atrophy. This virus, which infects chickens only, is present
in poultry flocks worldwide. All of the field isolates of the
virus, which appear to be equally pathogenic, belong to a
single serotype.
Epidemiology
Both horizontal and vertical transmission occur. Infection
is by the faecal-oral route.Vertical transmission through
the egg occurs during the 1 to 3- week viraemic period
following infection of laying hens. Once infection is
established in a breeder flock, most birds develop
antibodies  before laying begins.  Maternally-derived
antibodies do not prevent chicks from becoming infected
and shedding the virus. However, they prevent the
development of clinical disease. An age resistance to
disease but not to infection develops in chicks at about 2
weeks of age. In breeding flocks containing many
serologically positive adult birds, subclinical infection is
1610
common in chickens. Age resistance and the protective
effect of maternally-derived antibodies do not prevent
clinical disease if immunosuppressive viruses such as
infectious bursal disease virus or gallid herpesvirus 2 are
present in the flock.

and haemocytoblasts in the bone marrow. Destruction of
these cells results in immunosuppression and anaemia.
Gross post-mortem findings include atrophy of thymic and
bursal tissues, a pale bone marrow and haemorrhages in
skeletal muscle and at subcutaneous sites.
Clinical signs
Chickens develop clinical signs at about 2 weeks of age.
Affected birds are depressed, anorexic and pale. The
mortality rate, which is usually about 10%, may be up to
50%. Birds which survive the acute phase of the disease
recover slowly. Subclinical infection in broilers from
breeder flocks can adversely affect weight gains.
Diagnosis
A presumptive diagnosis is based on the clinical signs and
gross lesions at post mortem. Laboratory confirmation
relies on  detection of viralantigen by
1mmu-
nocytochemical
1 techniques.Viral
1 DNA can be
demonstrated in bone marrow and thymus by in situ
hybridization, by dot-blot hybridization or by PCR. Virus
isolation, although possible, is exacting and expensive.
Serum    antibodies  can    be   detected   using   virus
neutralization, indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA. A

seronegative breeder flocks before laying begins.
Control
Because infection with CAV is common, it is difficult to
maintain breeder flocks free of infection. Breeding birds
1612
should be exposed to infection before laying commences.
Seronegative flocks can be deliberately exposed to virus
by transfer of old litter from CAV- positive farms or by the
addition of crude tissue homogenates from affected birds
to drinking water but such exposure is unreliable and
inherently unsafe.
Commercial live vaccines are available and are designed to
prevent vertical transmission of the virus from breeder
hens. Vaccination does not prevent economic losses in
broilers due to subclinical infection. Control of other
immunosuppressive viruses in CAV- positive flocks is
essential due to the additive effects of these combined
infections.
Pig circovirus infection
Porcine circovirus was first described in 1974 as a
picornavirus-l ike contaminant of the continuous pig
kidney cell line PK/15. Experimental challenge suggests
that  this  virus,  termed
 porcine circovirus  1, is
non-pathogenic. An antigenically and genomically distinct
circovirus, porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2), is consistently
isolated  from piglets with post-weaning multisystemic
wasting syndrome (PMWS). Sero- epidemiological studies
indicate that infection with PCV 2 is widespread in pig
populations worldwide. The virus has also been linked to
porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and
recognized, PCV-2a, PCV-2b and PCV-2c
Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome
1613
Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), a
progressive wasting condition with lesions in several organ
systems, was first described in Canada in 1991 in specific
pathogen-free herds (Allan and Ellis, 2000)
Epidemiology
Although molecular methods indicate differences between
isolates of PCV-2, it is unclear if these differences
correlate  with pathogenicity.The oro-nasal route is
considered to be the principal transmission pathway with
efficient horizontal transmission to in-contact animals.
Viral shedding is thought to occur in nasal, salivary and
ocular secretions as well as in urine and faeces.
Pathogenesis
As pigs infected with PCV-2 do not always develop
PMWS, co-factors appear to be necessary for the
development of the full clinical disease. It is thought that
immune stimulation may be an important trigger, possibly
by increasing the number of permissive cells entering the S
phase of the cell cycle. A generalized depletion of
lymphocyctes is a consistent feature of the disease and the
destruction of thymic lymphocytes is believed to play a
central role in its pathogenesis (Darwich et al., 2004). The
virus is also capable of inducing hepatitis.
Clinical signs
Affected animals are usually 2 to 4 months of age and
present with weight loss, dyspnoea, enlarged lymph nodes,
diarrhoea and, sometimes, icterus. Morbidity rates in
1614
affected herds tend to range from 4% to 30% with a
mortality rate up to 80% in affected pigs.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of PMWS is based on clinical signs and
pathological  findings.  The  histopathological  changes  in
lymphoid tissues, which are characteristic, include
granulomatous inflammation, depletion of lymphocytes
and
intracytoplasmic
inclusions 
 in  macrophages
Antibodies to PCV 2 may be detected using indirect
immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase monolayer assay
or ELISA. Virus isolation in pig cell lines is also indicative
of infection. A definitive diagnosis requires demonstration
of PCV 2 antigen or viral nucleic acid in association with
lesions,  which  can  be achieved
dby theuseof
immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (Kim and
Chae, 2004)
Control
Due to the widespread nature of the virus, control is
largely directed at eliminating co-factors and predisposing
and contributory factors that may be present on individual
farms. Control is based on good husbandry, rapid removal
of affected animals and the elimination of other infectious
agents. Commercial inactivated and subunit vaccines are
available. The vaccines have been used in piglets or
altermatively in sows and gilts to provide passive immunity
to piglets via colostrum.

Retroviridae
Retroviruses (Latin retro, backwards) are labile, enveloped
RNA viruses, 80 to 100 nm in diameter. The family is
divided into two subfamilies,  Orthoretrovirinae and
Spumaretrovirinae. Seven genera are currently assigned to
the
family:
Alpharetrovirus,
Betaretrovirus,
Gammaretrovirus,
Deltaretrovirus,Epsilonretrovirus,
Len- tivirus and Spumavirus (Fig. 68.1). The family name
refers to the presence in the virion of a reverse tran-
scriptase, which is encoded in the viral genome.
The envelope, which is acquired from the plasma
membrane of the host cell, surrounds an icosahedral capsid
containing two linear, positive-sense, single strands of
RNA and core proteins including the enzymes reverse
 s      s
eccentric in the case of betare-troviruses, concentric for
alpharetroviruses, gamma-retroviruses, deltaretroviruses
and spumaviruses, and rod- shaped or truncated cone-
shaped in the case of lentiviruses (Fig. 68.3 and 68.4).
Historically, based on electron microscopy, retroviruses
were categorized as A-type, B-type, C-type and D-type
particles.
Reverse transcriptase acts as an RNA-dependent DNA
polymerase, which transcribes from RNA to DNA. The
RNA genome of replication-competent members of the
Retroviridae contains a minimum of three major genes or

(group-specific antigen) gene encodes structural proteins.
The pol (polymerase) gene encodes the enzymes reverse
transcriptaseand
1integrase. The env (envelope)gene
encodes the envelope glycoprotein which is transported to
the Golgi apparatus and cleaved into separate surface (SU)
and transmembrane (TM) subunits. A fourth essential
gene, the pro gene, is expressed in different ways in
 s  ds aa  p ss 
frame to the gag or pol gene. The pro (protease) gene
encodes the enzyme protease, which is responsible for
cleavage of precursor polyproteins and is the target of
protease-inhibiting drugs used in humans in highly active
antiretroviral
therapy
(HAART)
for
acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Cell entry involves a complex interaction between the
envelope glycoprotein and a specific cell receptor. It
appears that the SU subunit makes the initial contact. This
is followed by significant conformational changes in the
envelope protein. The TM subunit is thought to induce
fusion of the viral and cellular membranes resulting in
internalization of the virion core into the cytoplasm. Under
the influence of the reverse transcriptase, double-stranded
DNA copies of the viral genome are synthesized in the
cytoplasm of the host cell. During this process, repeat base
sequences, containing several hundred base-pairs and
called long terminal repeats (LTRs), are added to the ends
of the DNA transcripts. Transcripts are integrated into the
chromosomal DNA, as provirus, at random sites through
the action of viral integrase. The sites of proviral
1623
integration determine the extent and nature of cellular
changes. The LTRs contain important promoter and
enhancer  sequences,
which
 are  involved
1inthe
transcription of mRNA and virion RNA from provirus.
Release of mature virions often occurs by budding from
cell membranes. If the provirus of certain retroviruses is
inserted close to the host genes which regulate cell
division, the proviral LTRs may increase the rate of
mitosis with a risk of inducing neoplasia (insertional
mutagenesis)
Because errors are relatively frequent during reverse
transcription, a high mutation rate is a feature of retroviral
replication. In addition, recombination between retroviral
genomes in doubly-infected cells can occur because
reverse transcriptase can transfer from the RNA template
ofone virus to that of another. Consequently,
antigenically-different retroviruses
(quasispecies)
frequently  emerge  and  classification  of  species  and
subtypes often proves difficult.
Retroviruses can be categorized as endogenous or
exogenous. Endogenous retroviruses occur widely among
vertebrates, the result at some time in the distant past of
infection of germline cells. They are transmitted only as
provirus in germ cell DNA vertically, from parent to
offspring. They are regulated by cellular genes and are
usually silent. The gradual accumulation of these retroviral
   s  h  ae n sns
confer some advantage on the host. It has been suggested
that endogenous retroviruses act as restriction factors,
which block the replication of related, pathogenic,
exogenous retroviruses. However, the relationship between
1624
endogenous and exogenous retroviruses is complex
Endogenous retroviral genomes may contribute env genes
to produce recombinant feline leukaemia viruses and avian
leukosis viruses. Occasionally, endogenous retroviruses
can be activated by irradiation, mutagens or carcinogens
with the production of new virions.  Endogenous
retroviruses of pigs may be potentially dangerous for
humans receiving xenotransplants.
Retroviruses are sensitive to heat, lipid solvents and
detergents. Because of their diploid genomes, they are
relatively resistant to UV light
Clinical infections
Retroviruses in the genera Alpharetrovirus, Betare-
trovirus,Gammaretrovirus,Deltaretrovirus and Epsilon-
retrovirus are frequentlyreferredto as oncogenic
retroviruses    because
theycaninduce neoplastic
transformation of cells which they infect.
On the basis of the interval between exposure to the virus
and
tumour
 development, 
uegoouosnouegoxa
retroviruses are designated either as slowly transforming
s i    (
(transducing) viruses. Slowly transforming retroviruses
induce B cell, T cell or myeloid tumours after long
incubation periods. For malignant transformation to occur,
the provirus must be integrated into the host cell DNA
close to a cellular oncogene (c-onc, proto-oncogene),
resulting in interference with the regulation of cell division
(insertional mutagenesis). Most insertions are innocuous
and even if a host gene is disrupted, the mutation may be
1625
recessive in nature. Rarely the provirus insertion creates a
dominant- acting mutation that may result in the activation
of a proto-oncogene or, altermatively, the inactivation of a
tumour-suppressor gene. In contrast, rapidly transforming
retroviruses, which can induce tumour formation after
short incubation periods, contain viral oncogenes (v-onc).
Viral oncogenes are considered to be cellular oncogenes
acquired by recombination during virus evolution. These
oncogenes are very diverse in sequence and function and
include genes encoding intracellular tyrosine kinases
(v-src, v-fps, v-fes, v-abl), growth factors (v-sis), growth
factor receptors (v-erbB), transcription factors (v-myc,
V-erbA) and members of the G protein family (v-ras). Such
genes exert a strong influence on mitogenic signalling
pathways, on the control of the cell cycle and on
antiapoptotic pathways. If the oncogene is integrated into
the viral genome without loss of replicative virus genes, as
in Rous sarcoma virus, the retrovirus is described as
replication-competent.
t. Frequently, as a consequence of
cellular oncogene integration, existing trans-acting viral
sequences necessary
yfor replication are deleted. Such
replication-defective retroviruses rely on helper viruses to
multiply and are rarely transmitted under normal field
conditions.Occasionally
they may cause rapidly developing neoplastic disease. A
third method of tumour induction is exemplified by bovine
leukaemia virus which depends on the tax gene encoding
for a protein capable of up-regulating both viral LTRs and
cellular promoter sequences, even when the provirus is
integrated into a different chromosome (trans-activation).
A schematic representation of the important genes in
various categories of oncogenic viruses 1s presented in Fig
68.5.
1626
The newly established Epsilonretrovirus genus contains
viruses associated with neoplasia in fish. The oncogenic
retroviruses of poultry are presented in Table 68.1 and
those of domestic mammals in Table 68.2.
Lentiviruses (Latin lentus, slow) cause diseases with long
incubation  periods  and  insidious  protracted  courses.
Important   animal   and human    diseases   caused   by
lentiviruses include AIDs, feline immunodeficiency,
equine infectious anaemia and maedi/visna. Lentiviruses of
domestic animals are presented in Table 68.3. Although
spumaviruses (Latin spuma, foam) cause vacuolation of
cultured cells, they are not associated with clinical disease.
Spumaviruses have been identified in primates, cats,
horses and cattle.
Avian leukosis
The avian leukosis virus (ALV) group includes both
replication-competent   and   replication-defective   retro-
viruses. Neoplastic conditions in chickens including the
lymphoid, erythroid and myeloid leukoses, fibrosarcoma,
haemangiosarcoma and nephroblastoma are caused by
viruses in the group. Lymphoid leukosis, a B cell
lymphoma and the most common of these neoplastic
conditions, is economically the most important.

On the basis of differences in viral envelope glycoproteins.
avian leukosis viruses are divided into ten subgroups (A to
J). Isolates from chickens belong to subgroups A, B, C, D.
E and J; viruses in the other subgroups infect other avian
species. Most isolates
from outbreaks
of
disease
1n
chickens belong
to：
 subgroup
A.
Endogenous
avian
leukosis viruses, which are commonly present in chickens
and are transmitted vertically in the germline cells, usually
belong to subgroup E. Members of subgroup J, a group
recentlyrecognized
in
broilers, are associated
1with
1629
myeloid leukosis and have arisen from recombination of a
novel family of endogenous viruses (ev/J) and exogenous
avian leukosis viruses (Benson et al., 1998)
Because of the time required for the genetic events to
occur that lead to transformation of cells and malignancy,
there is usually an incubation period of months to years
between natural infection with ALV and the development
of neoplasia. Neoplastic conditions associated with ALV
include lymphoid leukosis, myeloid leukosis, sarcomas
and renal tumours. Avian leukosis virus is also associated
with osteopetrosis. One of the final steps in oncogenesis
can be the generation of recombinant, rapidly transforming
viruses, which have incorporated a cellular oncogene into
their genome. Viruses isolated from such tumours include
     
and Rous sarcoma virus, all of which rapidly cause
tumours when inoculated experimentally into susceptible
chickens. These viruses are usually defective and require a
helper ALV for replication. Rous sarcoma virus is
exceptional in that it has an oncogene (src) in addition to a
complete  ALV
genome,  and
consequently
1S
replication-competent as well as capable of rapid cell
transformation in vivo and in vitro. This type of acutely
transforming virus is very seldom, if ever, transmitted
under natural conditions. The endogenous ALVs carried
by chickens in most flocks do not directly cause tumours.
Epidemiology
Exogenous ALV is transmitted both vertically, through
virus present in egg albumen, and horizontally by close
contact. Chicks which hatch from infected eggs are usually
1630
immunotolerant and exhibit persistent viraemia. They are
the principal source of virus in a flock. Virus is transmitted
in saliva and faeces to incontact birds. Viral shedding into
oviducts results in transmission to chick embryos. Chicks
infected after hatching develop a transient viraemia before
they produce neutralizing antibodies. Some of these birds
may become carriers, shed virus intermittently and
produce infected chicks if exposed early in life in the
absence of maternal antibodies. Natural exposure of adult
birds to infection does not usually result in virus shedding.
Neoplasmsdevelop
inpersistentlyviraemic birds,
particularly
congenitally-infected
chicks.
Virus-neutralizing antibodies are passed in the yolk sac
from antibody-positive hens to their chicks, providing
passive immunity to infection for the first few weeks of
life.
Pathogenesis
Following infection, virus spreads throughout the body,
replicating in most tissues. Avian leukosis virus transforms
B cells after integration of provirus close to the c-myc gene
which induces cellular replication under the influence of
the viral LTR promoter. Less commonly, ALV has been
associated with erythrob- lastosis when the c-erbB gene in
an erythroid cell is activated. Subgroup J isolates are
associated with late- onset myeloid leukosis in broilers
(Benson et al., 1998). Rapidly transforming viruses are
formed rarely in individual birds by transfer of a c-onc
(proto-oncogene) into the ALV provirus during its
integration. Multiple insertions of the provirus into the host
cell genome result in exaggerated gene expression and
overproduction  of a  transformation-associated  protein.
1631
More than a dozen different oncogenes have been
identified in transforming avian retroviruses. The protein
products of oncogenes may act as hormone or growth
factor receptors, transcription control factors and kinases
virus strain may be capable of producing neoplasia of more
than one cell type, usually one cell type predominates in an
affected animal.
Clinical signs
The incubation period for lymphoid leukosis is usually
more than 4 months. Disease is generally sporadic in
infected flocks but occasional epidemics have been
described. Affected birds become inappetent, weak and
emaciated. They have pale wattles and the liver and bursa
of Fabricius may be enlarged. Osteopetrosis, in which the
long bones of the legs become visibly thickened.
sometimes accompanies lymphoid leukosis. Subclinical
infections with ALV are associated with depressed egg
production and fertility, decreased hatchability and growth
rate and increased death rates. Economic loss from
lymphoid leukosis is mainly due to deaths in egg-laying
and breeding birds between 5 and 9 months of age.
Diagnosis
·Post-mortem findings and histopathological determination of
tumour type are usually diagnostic.
 Differentiation from Marek's disease is important and is
based on the age of affected birds, the presence of bursal
tumours, absence of thickening of peripheral nerves and
histological assessment of neoplastic cell types.
·Virus isolation, which is difficult, is not usually attempted.

detection of ALV nucleic acid (Cavanagh, 200l). Specific
primers or sequencing of the amplicon can be used to
determine the infecting subgroup or to distinguish
endogenous from exogenous virus (Silva et af., 2007).
Control
The eradication of ALV infection with exogenous
subgroup A has been successfully achieved in most
commercial chicken  flocks.The  cycle  of vertical
transmission  is interrupted by hatching and rearing
infection-free chicks in isolation. Ongoing monitoring for
the presence of infection is essential. Because autosomal
genes encode subgroup-s pecific cell surface receptors
through which ALV gains entry to the cell, genetically
resistant birds with decreased numbers of specific cell
surface receptors can be bred. Attention has focussed
largely on resistance to subgroup A viruses. Selection for
  s o  s sis 
viruses capable of overcoming host resistance frequently
arise. Control of ALV infection in commercial flocks is
based on high standards of hygiene and effective
management aimed at reducing levels of infection. Birds
from disease-free or genetically resistant stock should be
used for breeding. Because the virus is labile, all-in all-out
management systems along with thorough washing and
disinfection programmes between batches of birds are
effective for preventing transfer of infection. Chicks of
1633
uncertain status should not be mixed with disease-free
chicks. Chick rearing should take place remote from older
birds. Vaccination with inactivated or modified live ALV
vaccines has not been successful.  Recombinant avian
leukosis and fowlpox viruses expressing subgroup A
envelope glycoproteins have been shown to have potential
as effective vaccines
Feline leukaemia and associated clinical conditions
Infection with feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) not only
results in feline leukaemia but is also associated with a
variety of other clinical conditions. On the basis of
differences in the gp70 envelope glycoprotein of FeLV,
isolates of this gammaretrovirus are assigned to four
subgroups (A, B, C and T). Feline leukaemia virus A
(FeLV-A), the predominant subgroup, can be isolated from
all FeLV-infected cats. Viruses of subgroup B, which arise
through recombination between the env genes of FeLV-A
and endogenous FeLV-related proviral DNA, are present
in about 50% of isolates. FeLV-B is transmitted only in
association with FeLV- A. In a proportion of cats exposed
to a mixture of FeLV-A and FeLV-B, the FeLV-B
component is lost. Therefore, the continuing survival of
FeLV-B depends upon the generation of new recombinants
in cats persistently infected with FeLV-A. Cats that are
infected with both FeLV-A and FeLV-B have a higher risk
of developing tumours than those infected with FeLV-A
alone. Each FeLV-C isolate is unique, arising de novo in a
FeLV- A infected cat through  mutations in the
receptor-binding region of the FeLV-A env gene. Once
generated, FeLV-C viruses rapidly cause a fatal anaemia
and consequently are not transmitted to other cats.
1634
Conversion of FeLV-A to FeLV-T requires a combination
of an insertion and single amino acid changes to the
envelope protein, giving rise to a T cell tropic, cytopathic
virus capable of inducing immunodeficiency. In order to
enter and infect host cells, FeLV-T requires a soluble
cofactor coded for by an endogenous retroviral sequence
(Cheng et al, 2007).
Like the ALVs, FeLV causes tumours by several means,
including insertional mutagenesis and recombination with
a variety of cellular proto-oncogenes to produce acutely
transforming, replication-defective viruses. Examples of
the latter are FeLVs isolated from thymic lymphomas, and
feline sarcoma viruses (FeSV) that are isolated from rare
multicentric fibrosarcomas in young cats. These viruses
are not transmitted under natural conditions
Epidemiology
Infection with feline leukaemia virus, which occurs in
domestic cats worldwide, is an important cause of
mortality. Close contact is required for transmission of this
labile virus, and the prevalence of infection is related to
population density, ranging from less than 1% in
individually kept cats to more than 20% in catteries and
multicat households. Large amounts of virus are shed in
saliva with smaller quantities present in tears, urine, milk
and faeces. Infection is usually acquired by licking,
grooming and through bite wounds. Young kittens are
matermally-derived antibody is protective in kittens up to 6
weeks of age, a significant proportion of those exposed
before 14 weeks of age become persistently infected. Such
1635
animals constitute the main reservoir of FeLV and they are
prone to develop FeLV-related disease. Most cats exposed
after 4 months of age develop immunity and eliminate the
virus. Kittens born to persistently-infected queens develop
persistent infection, acquired either transplacentally or
through ingestion of milk
Pathogenesis
Following oronasal exposure, virus replicates in the
lymphoid tissues of the oropharyngeal region. The virus
spreads in infected mononuclear leukocytes to other
lymphoreticular tissues and bone marrow. In most cats,
cell-mediated immunity and neutralizing antibodies to the
gp70 envelope glycoprotein are produced at this stage,
usually resulting in virus elimination. However, a latent
bone marrow infection, which is eliminated after several
months, is present in about 5o% of cats. Failure to contain
the infection results in extensive virus production in the
bone marrow and persistent viraemia. The virus, present in
both leukocytes and plasma, is disseminated to glandular
and mucosal epithelia. Large quantities of virus are shed
from the salivary glands and the upper respiratory tract.
Because the production of virus particles requires cellular
DNA synthesis, tissues with high mitotic activity such as
bone marrow and epithelia are targeted. Prolonged periods
of viral replication in haemo-lymphatic tissues can lead to
depletion of lymphoid and myeloid cells, producing
immunosuppression
and
anaemia.
Severe
immunosuppression is caused by infection with FeLV-T.
Isolates  of FeLV-C  are
associated
1withsevere
non-regenerative anaemia
1636
Neoplastic changes in lymphoid or myeloid cells follow
insertion of provirus close to a cellular oncogene with
activation or deregulation of the gene, or generation of
acutely transforming viruses by the acquisition of a
cellular oncogene such as myc by recombination.
Clinical signs
The incubation period ranges from months to years. The
majority of persistently-infected cats die within 3 years of
infection. About 80% of these cats die from non-neoplastic
FeLV-associated disease; the remaining 20% of infected
cats succumb to neoplasia, particularly lymphosarcoma.
During the early phase of infection, cats may develop
fever, malaise and lym-phadenopathy, which may not be
detected clinically. A variable period as asymptomatic
carrier cats follows. Clinical signs, which are often
non-specific and chronic, are usually seen in adult cats
between 2 and 4 years of age. Anaemia, reduction in
reproductive
performance,  fading
kitten  syndrome,
enteritis and a variety of secondary infections due to the
immunosuppressive effects of the virus are important
features of the disease. Immune complex formation,
initiated  by  circulating
gantigen, may give rise to
glomerulonephritis
Lymphosarcoma, the most commonly occurring feline
tumour, is usually linked to infection with FeLV. Thymic,
alimentary,  multicentric and leukaemic  forms  of
lymphosarcoma are described and clinical signs relate to
the anatomical sites involved. Fibrosarcoma and myeloid
tumours, which have also been associated with FeLV
infection, occur less frequently than lymphosarcoma.
1637
Diagnosis
Detection of viral antigen in blood or saliva is the method
commonly used for the laboratory diagnosis of feline
leukaemia. Virus isolation, which is expensive and
time-consuming, is used as a confirmatory test.
Commercial ELISA and rapid immunomigrationtests,
designed to detect the major capsid protein (p27), are
available. Cats giving positive results to these tests should be
retested some months later as their immune response may
clear the viraemia up to 16 weeks later.
·The immunofluorescent antibody test, which is generally
employed as a confirmatory test, can be used to detect viral
antigen in the cytoplasm of leukocytes in blood smears.
·Conventional PCR (Jackson et af., 1996; Miyazawa and
Jarrett, 1997) and real - time PCR (Hofmann - Lehmann et
al., 2001) assays are available for the detection of proviral
FeLV DNA in peripheral blood samples. However, cats
which have overcome FeLV viraemia may continue to be
provirus positive. Detection by RT-PCR of high virus loads
in saliva, plasma or faeces is a reliable indicator of viraemia
(Gomes-Keller et al., 2006).
 Serological testing for antibodies is not used for diagnosis
since both viraemic and recovered cats can have anti-FeLV
antibodies. However, the demonstration of a high titre of
virus neutralizing antibodies generally indicates that a cat is
immune and resistant to infection.

membrane antigen (FOCMA) is expressed in all FeLV and

Treatment and control
1638
Supportive treatment is important for FeLV-viraemic cats
Aggressive courses of antibiotics to combat secondary
infections may be needed. Treatment of viraemic cats with
feline interferon omega has been shown to improve
clinical signs and extend survival time. The antiviral drug
AZT has also been shown to be useful but requires careful
monitoring due to possible
side effects. A test and removal policy has been shown to
be effective in eradicating infection from catteries. The
status of individual cats should be confirmed by retesting
after 12 weeks. Infected cats, which must be separated
from susceptible animals, should be excluded from
breeding programmes. Serological testing for antigen at
intervals of 6 months is recommended and cats about to be
introduced into a cattery should be isolated until test
results are known. Several commercial vaccines, including
killed whole virus, recombinant canarypox virus, and
subunit and recombinant subunit types, are available.
Vaccination does not result in elimination of the virus in
persistently-  nfected   cats.  Accordingly,  prior  to
vaccination, cats should be tested. Vaccination does induce
helping to reduce proviral and viral loads. However,
vaccination does not provide complete protection or
prevent infection and other appropriate control measures
should be implemented also.
Enzootic bovine leukosis
This retroviral disease of adult cattle is characterized by
persistent lymphocytosis, the presence of circulating
antibody to the causal agent, bovine leukaemia virus
(BLV) and the development of B cell lymphosarcoma in a
1639
number of infected animals. Enzootic bovine leukosis
(EBL) has a worldwide distribution. Some countries,
including Ireland and most EU Member States, have
eradicated the disease; other countries are embarking on
eradication programmes.
Epidemiology
Transmission, which can occur by direct contact or
transplacentally, usually takes place through transfer of
blood or secretions such as colostrum and milk containing
infected lymphocytes. Infection with BLV is lifelong. The
labile virus is intimately cell-associated.
Less than 1o% of calves born to infected dams are infected
at birth. Calves are protected from contact infection for
several months by maternally-derived antibody. Animals
are usually infected between 6 months and 3 years of age
(Hopkins and DiGiacomo, 1997). Iatrogenic transmission
is important and has been linked to reuse of needles.
multidose injectors, contaminated surgical instruments and
rectal examination procedures. While biting flies may
transmit the virus mechanically, their importance as
vectors is uncertain. The prevalence of infection is higher
in dairy cattle than in beef cattle. Susceptibility to
infec-tion is influenced by genotype and related to the
bovine major histocompatibility antigen type.
Pathogenesis
The primary target cell is the B lymphocyte. Bovine
leukaemia virus does not possess an oncogene. Nucleic
acid sequences at the 3' end of the env gene, termed the X
1640
region, encode for the regulatory proteins Tax and Rex
which are central to neoplastic transformation. The Tax
protein interacts with cellular transcription factors
resulting in transactivation of the promoter in the LTR of
integrated BLV provirus. Up-regulation of some cellular
 genes including those coding for IL-2 and its receptor may
also occur.
Clinical signs
Although infections are lifelong, most animals remain
subclinically infected. About 30% of infected animals
develop
persistent
lymphocytosis,  an  increase
ein
lymphocyte numbers in the blood without clinical signs of
disease. A small percentage of BLV-seropositive cattle
eventually   develop  lymphosarcoma.  Clinical   disease
usually occurs in adult animals between 4 and 8 years of
age. The presenting signs, which relate to the sites of
tumour formation, include enlargement of superficial
lymph nodes, digestive disturbance, inappetence, weight
loss and general debility.
Diagnosis
from sporadic bovine leukosis which usually affects calves
and young adult cattle. Formerly, blood lymphocyte counts
were employed for laboratory diagnosis of infected
animals and for the eradication of EBL. However, all
infected cattle do not develop lymphocytosis. Serological
testing  for  virus-specific  antibody
is now used for
diagnosis and also for eradication.
1641
· Several serological tests including AGID and ELISA are
suitable for the detection of antibodies to BLV. Antibodies
detected in calves less than 6 months of age may be colostral
in origin.
·Although virus can be isolated by cultivation of peripheral
blood lymphocytes, this technique is not performed
routinely.
· The polymerase chain reaction has been employed as a
sensitive research tool for the detection of provirus in
peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Control
A commercial vaccine is currently not available. Test and
removal strategies have been successfully used
for both  national and  individual herd eradication
programmes. Serological testing at 6-month intervals is
recommended (Brunner et al., 1997). In countries in which
the prevalence of BLV infection is too high to permit
removal   of  all seropositive animals  from herds,
management practices aimed at reducing the spread of
infection  should be adopted. Such practices include
separating infected and susceptible animals, rearing calves
on milk from non-infected cows and serological testing of
replacement animals
Jaagsiekte
This disease, also called ovine pulmonary adenomatosis, is
a slowly progressing neoplastic disease of adult sheep. It is
caused by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), also known
as ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma virus. Jaagsiekte is an
Afrikaaner word meaning ‘panting sickness'. With the
e      
jaagsiekte has a wide geographical distribution. Goats
1642
the disease occurs rarely in goats. Multiple copies of
endogenous retroviruses related to JSRV have been found
in the genomes of both sheep and goats. Jaagsiekte sheep
retrovirus is not considered to be an endogenous retrovirus.
Epidemiology
Respiratory exudates from affected sheep are infectious
and transmission occurs by the respiratory route. Close
disease highest in housed animals. Within an infected
flock, disease incidence, which may be up to 20%, is
influenced by breed and type of flock management.
Susceptibility to jaagsiekte appears to be age-related with a
longer incubation period in older animals.
Pathogenesis
The virus replicates principally in two types of pulmonary
cells, type II alveolar cells and non-ciliated bronchial cells.
Hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2) has been shown to be the cellular
receptor for virus attachment before cell entry. Tumours
arising from these cell types progressively replace normal
lung tissue leading to death from asphyxia. The excess
production of surfactant proteins by the neoplastic cells
results in large amounts of pulmonary fluid. About 10% of
the tumours metastasize to regional lymph nodes.
Metastasis to heart or skeletal muscle occurs rarely. The
presence of an oncogene has not been demonstrated in the
viral genome and the envelope of the virus has been shown
to be capable of inducing cell transformation (Caporale et
al., 2006). Multiple copies of closely related endogenous
1643
betaret-roviruses (enJSRV) are present in the genome of
sheep and goats. They play a role in protecting their host
  s      
viral replication cycle (Varela et al., 2009). They are
expressed in the placenta and are required for placental
development, leading to speculation that this may account
for the apparent immunological tolerance in mature
animals  to the disease-producing, exogenous JSRV
(Palmarini et al., 2004).
Clinical signs
The incubation period may range from several months up
to 2 years. Tumour nodules have been detected in lambs as
early as 10 days after experimental inoculation. Affected
animals are usually 3 to 4 years of age and in poor bodily
condition. They display respiratory distress and mouth
'wheelbarrow test', when the hind legs are raised, a clear
fluid flows from the nostrils. Moist rales may be heard.
Often, only a single animal in a flock may be clinically
affected at a particular time. The course of the disease may
extend over weeks or months. Secondary pasteurellosis is a
frequent complication.
Diagnosis
The  characteristic clinical  signs may be masked in

secondary
infection.
Histo-pathological confirmation is desirable. Attempts to
culture the virus in monolayers have been unsuccessful. It
is possible to detect virus in lung exudates or washings by
ELISA and viral nucleic acid may be detected by PCR.
1644
Virus is also demonstrable in lymphoid tissue and
peripheral blood leukocytes. As infected animals do not
appear to develop a specific humoral immune response
(Ortin et al., 1998), it is not possible at present to confirm
infection by serology.
Control
Jaagsiekte was successfully eradicated from Iceland in
1952 after drastic depopulation procedures. The incidence
particularly during the rearing of lambs (Voigt et al.,
2007), and by elimination of suspect animals immediately
after clinical or laboratory confirmation.
Feline immunodeficiency virus infection
This condition was first reported in 1987 and infection
with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a lentivirus.
is now recognized worldwide as an important cause of
disease in cats. The infection in cats is sometimes referred
to as ‘feline AIDs’ on account of similarities to acquired
immunodeficiency virus. Five subtypes or clades of FIV,
designated A to E, have been identified based on diversity
in the envelope gene amino acid sequences. This diversity
may account for differences in the pathogenesis and
clinical progression of the disease associated with different
isolates. The majority of isolates belong to subtypes A or
B.
Epidemiology
1645
Infection with FIV occurs in domestic cats. Related
lentiviruses have been isolated from a number of wild
Felidae, including pumas, spotted hyenas and lions.
Seroprevalence in cats varies from region to region with
reported estimates of 1 to 14% in normal cats and up to
44% in cats showing clinical signs of chronic infections.
Animals remain infected for life. Virus is shed mainly in
the saliva and transmission usually occurs through bites.
Accordingly, infection rates are highest in free-roaming,
adult male cats. Nonaggressive intimate contact may also
be important in  transmission under natural conditions
Queens may transmit infection to kittens in utero, during
parturition or in milk, particularly during the acute phase
of infection.
Pathogenesis
The virus replicates principally in  CD4+ (helper)T
lymphocytes. Replication also occurs in macrophages,
dendritic cells, astrocytes and microglial cells. Infected
cats remain persistently viraemic. The level of viraemia
increases rapidly after infection and peaks at 8 to 12 weeks
before gradually declining and increasing again during the
terminal stage of the disease. Humoral responses are
normal, or occasionally
enhanced, with antibodies
appearing 2 weeks after infection. However, there is
progressive deterioration in cell-mediated immunity due to
depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Lymphocyte depletion
is attributed to the cytopathic effect of virus in addition to
decreased production of lymphocytes and apoptosis. Other
immunological abnormalities associated with the infection
include  reduced
1   interleukin-2   responsiveness   and
production, impaired lymphocyte blastogenesis in response
1646
tomitogens  and reduced antibodyresponse  to T
cell-dependent antigens. Reduction in CD4+ lymphocyte
numbers, increased production of virus, the emergence of
variants with increased virulence, and infection with
opportunistic pathogens contribute to the development of
clinical disease.
Clinical signs
The prevalence of clinical disease is highest in cats over 6
years of age. The course of the disease may be divided into
an acute phase, an asymptomatic phase, a phase
characterized by vague clinical signs and a terminal phase
with marked immunodeficiency (Hartmann, 1998). The
acute phase, which may last several weeks or months, is
manifested by pyrexia, generalized lymphadenopathy and
neutropenia. A prolonged period during which infected
cats appear clinically normal follows. The third phase is
marked by recurrent fever, leukopenia, anaemia, weight
loss, lymphadenitis, chronic gingivitis and behavioural
changes. Opportunistic infections are frequent in the
terminal phase of the disease. Chronic stomatitis is a
common finding. Other manifestations include chronic
respiratory, enteric and skin infections. Neurological signs.
usually due to direct viral damage, develop in a small
number of infected cats. Concurrent FeLV infection may
exacerbate the immunodeficiency and accelerate the
appearance of clinical signs. An increased incidence of
neoplasia, particularly B cell lymphomas, is recorded in
FIV-infected cats. Some infected cats do not develop
FIV-related clinical disease during their lifetime.
Diagnosis
1647
· Serological testing for antibodies to FIV is the principal
method for confirming infection. Commercial ELISA and
immunoconcentration kit-sets are available. Alternative tests
include immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence.
Some cats fail to produce antibodies for several months
following infection; antibody levels may become
undetectable in terminally ill cats. The kittens of infected
queens may remain seropositive for up to 5 months due to
ingestion of colostral antibodies.
· Although virus isolation from blood or saliva is possible, it
 is not considered realistic for routine diagnostic purposes.
· Proviral DNA can be detected using the polymerase chain
reaction. However, these tests are not reliable in all cases
and may be inferior to serological tests (Crawford et af.,
2005). In general, these tests detect virus belonging to
subtype A in a reliable manner; they are considered to be
less reliable for detecting other subtypes of this virus.
Treatment and control
Treatment is aimed primarily at the control of secondary
infections. A number of antiviral drugs such as
azidothymidine (AZT), directed against viral reverse
transcriptase, have a beneficial effect in clinically ill cats
but   do  not   eliminate   infection.  Unfortunately,
AZT-resistant mutants of FIV can arise within months of
human interferon alpha have been used with varying
success. A commercial, killed, whole virus (subtypes A
and D) vaccine is available and has been shown to protect
against some heterologous virus strains (Hosie and Beatty,
2007). It is difficult to distinguish serologically between
vaccinated and infected cats, although one approach has
been to use a dualsubtype vaccine (Kusuhara et al., 2007).
Control is based on prevention of exposure by separating
infected and non-infected cats in multicat households, by
1648
preventing cats from roaming freely, by using seronegative
queens for breeding and by screening all cats before
introduction into seronegative populations
Equine infectious anaemia
This disease, also called swamp fever, affects horses,
mules and donkeys in many countries worldwide. It is
caused by a lentivirus, equine infectious anaemia virus
(EIAV). Although infected Equidae remain viraemic for
life, such animals often bring the infection under control
with limited viral replication evident and an absence of
clinical signs.
Epidemiology
Virus is transmitted mechanicallyby haematophagous
insects, particularly Tabanus and Stomoxys species. The
virus survives for only short periods on the mouth-parts of
biting flies. These haematophagous insects usually obtain a
complete blood meal from a single host. If interrupted
during feeding, they may transfer virus to another host
when they resume feeding. Transmission occurs most
often in the summer, during periods of high insect activity,
in low-lying swampy areas close to woodlands (the
preferred habitat of tabanids). The risk of transmission is
related to the levels of virus in the blood, being highest
during febrile episodes. Iatrogenic transmission can occur
through  contaminated  needles  or  surgical  instruments.
Although in utero transmission can occur, it is uncommon.
Pathogenesis
1649
Virus replicates in macrophages, monocytes and Kupffer
cells. A cell-associated
viraemia
1   develops
with
dissemination throughout the body (Oaks et al., 1998)
Although EIAV infects monocytes, viral expression
appears tooccuronly
followingmacrophage
differentiation in the tissues, a mechanism referred to as
the ‘Trojan horse'. Despite mounting a strong immune
response, infected horses fail to eliminate the virus and
become persistently  infected
1following insertionof
provirus into the genome of host cells. With the continuous
production of virus particles, many target cells become
infected. In the course of further provirus production by
reverse transcription in infected cells, mutations frequently
arise due to errors during the transcription process. This
can result in the emergence of new virus strains or
quasispecies exhibiting antigenic  variation in envelope
glycoproteins (antigenic
drift).Febrile episodes and
marked immune stimulation signal the emergence of these
new strains. Non-neutralizing antibodies produced against
virus early in the course of infection lead to the formation
of immune complexes. Such immune complexes activate
complement contributing to the initiation of fever, anaemia
and thrombocytopenia, and later, glomeru- lonephritis
Haemolysis, enhanced
[ erythrophagocyto- sis
 and
depressed erythropoiesis are responsible for the anaemia in
chronically affected horses. In most animals, clinical
episodes eventually cease, probably as a consequence of a
broad-based immune  response  involving cytotoxic  T
lymphocytes and neutralizing antibodies against a wide
range of viral epitopes.
Clinical signs
1650
The majority of infected horses display mild signs, which
may go undetected. Most of the clinical signs are attributed
to the host's immune response rather than to direct viral
damage. Following an incubation period of up to 3 weeks.
infected animals may present with fever, depression and
petechiae  on  mucous
membranes and conjunctivae.
However, following this phase of the disease, most horses
appear clinically normal for several  weeks until  the
recrudescence of clinical signs. Rarely, severe epistaxis
and ventral oedema may be followed by death. The
number and severity of recurring disease episodes vary
widely. Most occur during the first vear after infection and
decline in number thereafter. Many horses that appear
clinically normal remain carriers. Some exhibit a chronic
form of the disease characterized by weight loss, anaemia,
ventral oedema and debilitation, leading eventually to
death.
Diagnosis
Laboratory confirmation of infection is based on  the
demonstration of serum antibodies to the core virus protein
p26.
·The serological test recognized for international trade is the
AGID test (Coggins test). Although the ELISA is a suitably
sensitive assay, positive results should be confirmed by the
more specific AGID test. Results can also be confirmed by
immunoblotting.
 Antibodies may not be detectable early in the course of the
disease.
·False-positive results may be encountered in foals up to 6
months of age owing to the presence of colostral antibodies.
1651
·The presence of viraemia can be demonstrated by
inoculation of a susceptible horse with blood from a suspect
animal.
·Virus can be isolated in leukocyte cultures prepared from the
blood of susceptible horses. Because of the time and expense
involved, virus isolation is rarely attempted.
Proviral DNA may be detected by PCR and viral RNA can
be detected using RT-PCR.
Control
Commercial
1vaccines are not available inwestern
countries. Envelope antigenic variation among strains of
EIAV presents a significant obstacle to the development of
an effective vaccine. Control measures are aimed at
reducing the risk of infection. In many countries,
legislation requires certification of freedom from EIA prior
to importation of horses. Restriction of animal movement
is also used to minimize the risk of disease spread.
Management practices, including detection and removal of
seropositive animals, insect control and testing of animals
prior to introduction on to a property, are worthwhile
control measures. Care should be taken to ensure that
chemicals    used    routinely   for  disinfecting   surgical
instruments also inactivate EIAV.
Small ruminant lentivirus group
Two distinct lentiviruses have been described in small
ruminants. While maedi/visna  virus (MVV) primarily
affects sheep  and  caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus
(CAEV) principally affects goats, some strains of these
closely-related viruses are transmissible to both sheep and
goats with the production of persistent infections. Genomic
1652
analyses of these ovine and caprine lentivirus isolates
suggest that they evolved from a common ancestral
genotype. The current view is that they comprise a
heterogeneous group with a variable host range and
different pathogenic capabilities (Pasick, 1998; Shah et al.,
2004).
Maedi/visna
This lentiviral disease, also referred to as ovine progressive
pneumonia, la bouhite and zwoegersiekte, occurs in many
countries. Maedi/visna virus (MVV) causes a life-long
infection in sheep and is associated with chronic
progressive disease in adult sheep. Maedi and visna,
wasting', respectively, refer to the clinical features
encountered in the respiratory form and the rare nervous
form of the disease. Maedi/visna caused significant losses
in Icelandic sheep prior to its eradication in 1965. Apart
from  Iceland,  Australia and  New 
Zealand, ovine
lentiviruses are present in most countries.
Epidemiology
Infection is frequently subclinical. The clinical severity of
disease is influenced by viral virulence, the age of the host
when exposed and other host factors. Although virus is
widely distributed in tissues of infected animals, it is
transmitted principally in pulmonary exudates, colostrum
and milk. Horizontal transmission occurs by inhalation of
during winter housing. In flocks with endemic disease,
lambs may be exposed to infection by lactogenic
1653
transmission if borm to seropositive ewes or to infection
from aerosols. Transmission may occur transplacentally or
by iatrogenic exposure but such routes are probably of
minor importance.
Pathogenesis
Clinical signs take several months or years to develop. The
chronic, progressive inflammation is characterized by
mononuclear cell  infiltration  and  lymphopro-liferation,
particularly in the lungs and mammary glands. Lesions are
also present in synovial membranes and in the brain.
Persistent infection and the interaction between viral
antigens and cellular and humoral components of the
immune system are responsible for the development of
lesions. Provirus integrated into the genome of monocytes
and their precursors is activated only when the monocytes
develop into macrophages. Restricted virus production in
the monocytes permits insidious spread of virus around the
body with minimal immune stimulation (Trojan horse
mechanism). The occurrence of antigenic variants during
the course of an infection, as a result of genetic instability,
also facilitates persistence. For some weeks after infection,
immuneresponse,
sufficient to restrict virus production to low levels, does
not eliminate infection. Both humoral and cell-mediated
responses occur in infected sheep but neither is fully
effective and may, in fact, contribute to the pathogenesis of
the disease. The period from infection to seroconversion is
usually up to 8 weeks but may take several months or
years. This delay in antibody response reflects a low level
of viral antigen production (Brodie et al., 1998).
1654
Clinical signs
Clinical disease develops slowly and is rarely observed in
animals less than 2 years of age. It is influenced by the
prevalence of infection in the flock and by breed.
Concurrent infection with jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus in the
flock results in severe disease. Only about 30% of infected
animals develop clinical signs. Respiratory distress, which
becomes more severe as the disease progresses, is the most
common clinical presentation. Affected sheep are usually
afebrile until the later stages of the disease when secondary
bacterial infection often occurs. Death is due to anoxia or
to secondary infection. Indurative mastitis with reduction
in milk production, which results in poor growth of lambs.
is a relatively common finding. Lameness and swelling of
one or more joints, particularly the carpus and tarsus, have
been described in some flocks. Neurological signs, which
are relatively rare, may occur in association with other
signs of the disease.
Diagnosis
A presumptive clinical diagnosis of maedi/visna can be
confirmed serologically and should be conducted on a
flock basis. The time required for seroconversion may be
long and unpredictable but, once antibody production is
initiated, it continues. Commonly used serological assays
include AGID, ELISA and western blotting. Virus
isolation is possible but time-consuming and expensive.
Viral nucleic acid can be detected in peripheral blood and
in tissues by PCR but the procedure is not widely used on
account of the wide strain variation and the low virus load
in vivo (de Andres et al., 2005)
1655
Control
Eradication of MVV infection requires regular serological
monitoring and removal of seropositive animals. Newborn
lambs should be removed at birth from infected dams and
reared in isolation. Colostrum and milk from certified
MVV-free ewes should be used for feeding lambs. An
effective vaccine is not available at present.
Caprine arthritis-encephalitis
This lentivirus disease of goats, characterized by
polyarthritis
in：
 adults 
 and, 
 rarely,  by
leukoencephalomyelitis in kids, occurs worldwide. It is
caused
by
persistent i
infection
with
 caprine
arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV)
Epidemiology
Although infection is common among dairy goats in most
countries, clinical disease is uncommon. The virus is
usually acquired by kids during the neonatal period
through ingestion of colostrum or milk from infected does.
Close contact between susceptible and infected goats over
an extended period is required for horizontal transmission.
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis is similar to that of maedi/visna with
persistent  infection
   and 
1  non-protective  immune
mechanisms responsible for lesion development. Virus
production occurs after infected monocytes develop into
macrophages.  Viral  antigens  provoke   a   vigorous
1656
cell-mediated reaction  which is responsible for the
characteristic changes in target tissues.
Clinical signs
The most common presentation in adult animals is arthritis
       
Swelling of affected joints, particularly the carpus, occurs
but the degree of lameness is variable. Affected animals
gradually lose weight. Reduced milk production relates to
chronic  mastitis.   A  rapidly  progressive  neurological
disease, which can affect kids up to 4 months of age,
manifests as posterior paresis progressing to quadriplegia.
Diagnosis
Laboratory
 confirmation  relies
on
detectionof
virus-specific antibodies. The most commonly used assays
are AGID and ELISA. Virus isolation can be achieved by
co-cultivating leukocytes from blood or milk with synovial
membrane cells. Nucleic acid detection by PCR is also
possible.
Control
This is based on test and segregation programmes. Infected
flocks should be tested regularly and seropositive animals
should be culled; kids should be separated
from their dams at birth and reared on heat-treated
colostrum or pasteurized milk. An effective vaccine is not
currently available.

Reoviridae
Viruses in the family Reoviridae were originally isolated
from respiratory and enteric sources without any
associated disease, namely orphan. These icosahedral
viruses, 60 to 80 nm in diameter, are non-enveloped and
possess a layered capsid which is composed of one to three
concentric protein shells (Fig. 69.1). The family contains
15 genera, which can be divided into two groups based on
their appearance: ~spiked’ viruses, so called because they
possess turret-shaped projections situated at the 12
icosahedral vertices, and ‘smooth’ viruses, which have a
spherical appearance. It has been proposed to create two
subfamilies,  Spinareovirinae and  Sedoreovirinae,  in
recognition of these two morphological forms. The
genome of the virion is composed of 10 to 12 segments of
double-stranded RNA. Genetic reassortment readily takes
place in cells co-infected with viruses of the same species.
Replication occurs in the cytoplasm ofhost cells often with
the formation of intracytoplasmic inclusions. Members of
the genera Orthoreovirus and Rotavirus infect animals and
humans (Fig. 69.2). Members of the genera Orbivirus,
Coltivirus and Seadornavirus infect both arthropod vectors
and vertebrate hosts. The genera Fijivirus, Phytoreovirus
andOryzavirus
contain viruses of plants that are
transmitted by arthropod vectors (leafhoppers). The genera
Idnoreovirus,
Cypovirus,
and
Cardoreovirus contain viruses of arthropods, while
members of the genus Aquareovirus infect fish. Members
of the genus Mycoreovirus infect fungi and the genus
1663
Mimoreovirus contains a virus which infects algae. Viruses
in the family are moderately resistant to heat, organic
solvents and non-ionic detergents. Orthoreoviruses and
rotaviruses are stable over a wide range of pH values
unlike orbiviruses which lose infectivity at low pH values.
In some genera, the action of proteases such as trypsin on
the outer capsid shell is essential for the development of
infectivity; the modified virions are termed infectious or
intermediate subviral particles (ISVPs)

Diseases c aused by a vian o rthoreoviruses
Infections caused by avian orthoreoviruses are usually
inapparent. In certain circumstances, however, they may
either cause primary disease or contribute to the severity of
1668
mixed infections. Using serum neutralization tests, at least
nine serotypes are recognized. Although transmission is
mainly by the faecal-oral route, transfer to developing
chicks in ovo can occur. Arthritis/tenosynovitis, caused by
orthoreoviruses in chickens between 4 and 16 weeks of
age, has been reported worldwide. Lameness is a
prominent feature of this disease and rupture of the tendon
of the gastrocnemius muscle may occur. Affected birds
have limited mobility and may die of starvation. Morbidity
is usually less than 1o%. The synovial lesions resemble
those caused by infection with Mycoplasma synoviae or
with Staphylococcus aureus. Orthoreovirus involvement
can be confirmed by virus isolation. Specimens suitable for
virus isolation are affected articular cartilage and tendon
sheaths. Synovial fluid is not a reliable source for virus
isolation. Suspensions of macerated tissues are inoculated
into the yolk sac of embryonated eggs or on to monolayers
of chick embryo liver cells. Avian orthoreoviruses induce
syn-cytium formation. Viral antigen may be detectable by
immunofluorescence
in cryostat sections of tissues.
RT-PCR protocols are available for the detection and
differentiation of avian orthoreoviruses (Caterina et al.,
2004; Liu et al., 2004). Although serological
testing is not particularly useful because of the high
prevalence of subclinical infections, it may be employed to
determine the immune status of a flock. Both inactivated
and modified live vaccines have been used in parent flocks
to stimulate high levels of maternally-derived antibody in
chicks. However, vaccines may induce protection only
against homologous serotypes (Meanger et al., 1997).
Control measures include total depopulation at the end of a
production  cycle followed by thorough cleansing and
disinfection of premises
1669
Enteric disease caused by rotaviruses in young animals
Rotaviruses cause diarrhoea in intensively-reared young
farm animals worldwide. Isolates are divided into seven
antigenically distinct serogroups (A to G), also termed
species, based on reactions with the major capsid protein,
VP6. The host range varies depending on the viral species.
Rotavirus E has been isolated only from pigs to date, while
rotavirus D, F and G are associated only with avian
species. Most isolates belong to serogroup A. Fifteen
serotypes (G1-G15) are recognized within serogroup A on
the basis of the antigenicity of VP7, an outer capsid
glycoprotein, which is highly immunogenic and induces
type-specific neutralizing antibodies. Field infections with
rotaviruses are considered to be species-specific. However,
virus isolates from one species can be transmitted
experimentally to other species. Human infection with
animal rotaviruses appears to be uncommon (Cook et al.,
2004).
Epidemiology
High titres of virus (1o 9 virus particles per gram of faeces)
are excreted by clinically affected animals. Horizontal
transmission occurs following ingestion of contaminated
feed. Because the virus is stable in the environment,
premises
maybeheavily
contaminated and
intensively-reared animals are those most often affected.
 spo a    o s
thorough cleansing and disinfection procedures are not
implemented.
Pathogenesis
1670
The severity of infection is largely determined by the
virulence of the infecting viral strain, the amount of virus
ingested and the level of matermally-derived immunity.
Other factors that influence the outcome of infection
include age of the animal at the time of exposure,
overcrowding and the presence of other enteric pathogens.
Rotavirus diarrhoea has malabsorption and secretory
components (Ramig, 2004). The virus, which can survive
gastric acidity, passes through the stomach and infects
enterocytes at the tips of villi in the small intestine. For
many years a crypt-cell invasion hypothesis has been
accepted as the explanation for the diarrhoea associated
with rotavirus infection in young animals. Infection is
thought to result in destruction of mature enterocytes
located on the upper two-thirds of the villi of the small
intestine. Because the rate of enterocyte replacement is
relatively slow in young animals, affected villi become
stunted and covered by cuboidal cells. These immature
replacement cells have reduced levels of disaccharidases
and
defective  glucose-coupled
1sodium
I transport.
Undigested lactose provides an ideal substrate for bacterial
proliferation in the intestinal lumen. In addition, it exerts
an osmotic effect which results in the retention of fluid in
the lumen and, along with impaired fluid absorption,
contributes to the development of a malabsorption type of
diarrhoea. However, the correlation between histological
lesions and disease signs is not absolute; it is possible for
diarrhoea to occur in the absence of visible tissue damage.
The non-structural protein NSP4 has been shown to
function as an entero-toxin, specifically inhibiting the Na
transporter protein, SGLT1 (Lorrot and Vasseur, 2007)

Diagnosis

 Although negative-contrast electron microscopy is rapid,
large numbers of virus particles (lo° per gram of faeces)
must be present for reliable confirmation. Immunoelectron
microscopy increases the sensitivity of the procedure. Mixed
viral infections can be detected by negative-contrast electron
microscopy.
latex agglutination. The antiserum employed in these tests is
usually specific for sero-group A rotaviruses. Reagents for
these assays are
commercially available. Immunofluorescence can be used to
detect viral antigen in smears or in cryostat sections of
affected small intestines.
Sodium
dodecyl
sulphate-polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) has been used successfully to
demonstrate RNA segments of rotaviruses in clinical
samples. The sensitivity of this procedure is comparable
with electron microscopy. The electrophoretic patterns
permit differentiation of rotavirus serogroups.
Rotaviruses are difficult to isolate in tissue culture from
clinical samples. The addition of low concentrations of
1672
trypsin to the growth medium facilitates viral uncoating and
improves viral replication.
Treatment
Oral electrolyte solutions may be beneficial in some cases.
Intravenous fluid replacement and antibiotic administration
are required in severe cases complicated by bacterial
infection.
Control
Measures aimed at reducing the levels of virus challenge in
young animals are essential. These must be combined with
management procedures which ensure that neonatal
animals receive adequate amounts of colostrum. Local
immunity is more important than circulating antibody;
ingestion of colostrum provides protective antibodies in
the intestinal lumen. Vaccination of pregnant dams
enhances antibody levels in mammary secretions. Oral
vaccination  of newborn  animals  using  modified  live
vaccine is of questionable  value.  A modified live
pentavalent vaccine has been developed by reassorting a
bovine rotavirus isolate (strain WC3) with five human
rotavirus A serotypes and appears promising in human
infants. Stressful environmental  conditions should be
minimized.
African horse sickness
This is a non-contagious disease of horses, mules and
donkeys caused by African horse sickness virus (AHSV).
Nine serotypes of this orbivirus, which can be
distinguished by neutralization tests, constitute the African
1673
horse sickness serogroup. The disease is endemic in
subtropical and tropical Africa, where the zebra is
considered to be the natural vertebrate host and reservoir
of the virus. Although serious outbreaks of AHSV serotype
9 have occurred in the Middle East, India and Pakistan, the
disease has not persisted in these regions. Outbreaks of
serotype 4 have been recorded in Spain, Portugal and
Morocco in recent years. African horse sickness is
classified as a listed disease by the Office Intermational des
Epizooties.
Epidemiology
The virus is transmitted by haematophagous insects. The
principal biological vector is Culicoides imicola, a species
of Afro-Asian midge, which remains infected for life. This
midge prefers a warm climate; it aestivates at temperatures
below 10?C, while replication of the virus in the midge
ceases at temperatures below 15°C (Mellor et al., 1998).
With  increased  temperatures  associated with  climate
change in recent years, the distribution of Culicoides
imicola has extended northwards into southern Europe as
far as latitude 46°N. Endemic disease occurs only in
regions where C. imicola is constantly present. Epidemics
of African horse sickness occur periodically outside these
regions following climatic conditionswhichallow
     s   s 
Outbreaks of the disease are seasonal, usually occurring in
late summer. The virus may be isolated from clinically
normal maintenance hosts such as the zebra and African
donkey. Although dogs are susceptible  to infection
following ingestion of infected horsemeat, they do not
appear to have any role in the epidemiology of the disease.
1674
Pathogenesis and pathology
The primary sites of viral replication are believed to be
regional lymph nodes, spleen and lungs. Viraemia persists
throughout the febrile period, typically 4 to 8 days. In
zebras and donkeys, viraemia may last up to 4 weeks.
Endothelial cells are important sites of secondary viral
replication, resulting in increased vascular permeability,
oedema, haemorrhage and intravascular coagulation.
Post-mortem findings include diffuse pulmonary oedema,
hydrothorax, ascites and hydropericardium.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is usually less than 9 days. Four
forms of this febrile disease, all of which can occur in a
particular outbreak, are recognized. A peracute pulmonary
form is characterized by depression and nasal discharge
with rapid progression to severe respiratory distress.
Mortality rate may approach 1oo%. A subacute cardiac
form manifests as conjunctivitis, abdominal pain and
progressive dyspnoea. Subcutaneous oedematous swellings
of the head and neck are most obvious in the supraorbital
fossae, palpebral conjunctiva and intermandibular space.
Colic is often a feature of this form of the disease, which
has a mortality rate of up to 70%. A third form of African
horse sickness,
the mixed form, presents with both cardiac and pulmonary
features. A mild or subclinical form, termed horse sickness
fever, is the only form observed in zebras and African
donkeys.
Diagnosis
1675
· Characteristic clinical signs, such as oedema of the
supraorbital fossae, may allow a clinical diagnosis.
Post-mortem findings, including pericardial and pleural
effusions, are consistent with a diagnosis of African horse
sickness.
· Suitable samples for laboratory examination include blood,
lymph node and spleen. Inoculation of cell cultures may be
used to demonstrate the presence of virus. Intracerebral
inoculation of newborn mice may also be used for this
purpose. Virus can be identified by immunofluorescence and
typed using virus neutralization with monovalent antiserum
or competitive ELISA.
·Viral antigen can be detected in samples by sandwich
ELISA.
Viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR (Zientara et al.,
1998). This test may provide results within 24 hours and can
be used to distinguish the nine serotypes (Sailleau et al.,
2000).
neutralization tests. In acute disease, infected animals may
die before antibodies are produced. Seroconversion  in
donkeys, used as sentinel animals outside endemic areas,
confirms the presence of the disease.
Control
Vector control, quarantine of affected animals and
vaccination are the main methods for preventing outbreaks
of disease. Insect vector control includes the use of
repellents and insecticides, the elimination of insect
breeding areas and housing of animals in insect-proof
buildings at dawn and at dusk when insect activity is
highest. Attenuated vaccines, both monovalent and
polyvalent containing up to four serotypes, are available.
However, these vaccines fail to prevent viraemia and may
cause teratogenic effects in pregnant mares. Moreover, the
1676
vaccine virus may revert to a virulent state and be
transmitted by vectors. In addition, vaccinated animals
cannot be differentiated serologically from those with field
infections. Inactivated vaccines, based on serotype 4, are
effective  in preventing clinical disease.  A polyvalent
vaccine must be used if there is a risk of exposure to
different serotypes. Protective immune responses may be
generated using recombinant-expressed structural proteins
as subunit vaccines (Roy and Sutton, 1998). Such vaccines
should be safe and permit differentiation of vaccinated
from infected animals. Adequate bio-containment facilities
are mandatory for vaccine production.
Bluetongue
This non-contagious viral disease of sheep and other
domestic and wild ruminants is transmitted by biting
insects, principally Culicoides species. Isolates of the
causal agent, bluetongue virus (BTV), belong to a distinct
serogroup in the Orbivirus genus. Twenty-five serotypes
of BTV have now been described; the most recent
serotype, Toggenburg orbivirus, was isolated from goats in
Switzerland. Bluetongue (BT) is of greatest significance in
sheep and deer. The severity of the disease is influenced by
the serotype of the virus, the breed of sheep and prevailing
environmental conditions. Bluetongue is classified as a
listed disease by the Office International des Epizooties.
Epidemiology
and 40°S, reflecting the distribution of Culicoides species.
Culicoides imicola is the principal vector in Africa, the
1677
Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East. In Australia, C.
transmission are C. varipennis var. sono-rensis in North
America and C. insignes in South America. Since 2006,
BTV-8 has caused a severe epizootic in Northern Europe.
Indigenous  European  Culicoides  species  including  C.
dewulfi and C. obsoletus complex appear to be capable of
next (Saegerman et al., 2008). Clinical disease in cattle has
been a feature of this epizootic with clinical signs similar
to but generally milder than those observed in sheep.
Female midges feeding on viraemic animals become
infected and virus replicates in their tissues. Culicoides
species can transmit virus in saliva within 7 to 1o days and
they remain infected for life. Temperatures of 18?C to
29°C along with high humidity favour insect activity,
while temperatures greater than 12°C are required for virus
replication within the vector. These factors account for the
seasonal occurrence of the disease in many parts of the
world. Culicoides species are most active at dawn and
dusk. In localized areas within endemic regions, there may
be an increased frequency of BT outbreaks. These areas
are particularly suitable for the breeding of Culicoides
species because of the accumulation of animal faeces in
marshland. Extension of disease to contiguous areas occurs
through the
movement of viraemic animals or insect vectors. Although
the flight range of Culicoides species is limited, they may
be transported over long distances by wind movement
resulting in BT outbreaks in  susceptible ruminant
populations outside endemic regions. Such events may
precipitate  epidemics  which  are usually  self-limiting
1678
unless the climate is suitable for vector activity throughout
the year. It is considered that four potential routes may
operate for the virus to overwinter in ruminant populations,
permitting viral
 recrudescence
inspring:vertical
transmission in ruminants (dam to offspring), prolonged
subclinical  virae-mia  in   certain  infected  individual
animals, vertical transmission in the vector with survival of
infected offspring through the winter, and survival of
infected adult midges (Wilson et al., 2008).
In endemic areas, infection of cattle is common and
usually inapparent. The viraemia in cattle commonly lasts
several weeks facilitating acquisition of virus by insect
vectors. Consequently, cattle are considered to be
important  reservoirs  of   virus  (Barratt-Boyes  and
MacLachlan, 1995). During the viraemic phase, virus can
be detected in the semen of a proportion of rams and bulls.
Venereal and transplacental transfers of BTV infection are
generally considered to be uncommon but the strain of
BTV-8 circulating in northern Europe appears to be
capable of vertical transmission in the ruminant population
(Menzies et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2008). Embryos
collected from infected ewes may transmit infection to
recipient ewes but this can be prevented by washing the
embryos extensively (Singh et al., 1997)
Pathogenesis and pathology
After experimental infection, the virus replicates initially
in regional lymph nodes. It is then carried in blood or
further replication   takes  place.  Virus  localizes and
multiplies in the endothelium of small blood vessels
1679
producing vascular damage with stasis, exudation and
tissue hypoxia. The initiation and development of surface
lesions in areas of tissue hypoxia relate to minor trauma
and may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection.
Lesions are particularly evident in the oral cavity, around
the mouth and on the coronet of the hoof. In the
bloodstream,  the
virus
is highlycell-associated,
particularly with erythrocytes. It has been suggested that
this may protect virus from antibody and allow the virus to
persist. Infectious virus can be detected for 35 to 60 days
after infection. Sporadic cases of clinical disease in cattle
with participation of IgE as a result of previous exposure
to BTV or related orbiviruses.
Clinical signs
The clinical presentation, which is highly variable, ranges
from subclinical infection to severe disease with high
mortality. Severe disease is generally confined to Merinos
and European mutton breeds. Nutritional status, exposure
to sunlight and age also appear to influence the severity of
lesions. The incubation period in sheep is up to 10 days
Affected animals are febrile and depressed with vascular
congestion of the lips and muzzle. Oedema of the lips,
face, eyelids and ears develops. Erosions and ulcers are
evident on the oral mucosa. There is excessive salivation
and a watery discharge that subsequently becomes
mucopurulent and dries forming crusts around the nares.
The tongue may be swollen and cyanotic. Lameness may
result from coronitis and laminitis. Some animals develop
torticollis. Abortion may occur and lambs may be weak or
deformed at birth. Mortality rate may be up to 30% and, in
1680
some outbreaks, may be higher. Animals recovering from
infection may lose part of their fleece some weeks later.
Clinical cases in susceptible cattle are characterized by
fever, stiffness, ulceration of the oral mucosa, burnt
muzzle’ and dermatitis. Cattle infected during pregnancy
may abort or give birth to malformed calves
Diagnosis
A presumptive diagnosis of BT may be based on clinical
findings and post-mortem lesions. Diagnostic methods
include identification of the virus or demonstration of
BTV-specific antibodies in non-vaccinated animals.
· Samples suitable for virus isolation include unclotted blood
from febrile animals or fresh spleen and lymph node
collected at post-mortem. Virus may be isolated by
intravenous inoculation of embryonated eggs or in cell
culture.
·A highly sensitive nested RT-PCR has been developed for
detecting BTV nucleic acid in clinical samples (Aradaib et
af., 2003). Molecular techniques can detect BTV nucleic
virus can be isolated. Protocols for quantifying viral load
(Shaw et al., 2007; Toussaint et al., 2007) and differentiating
viral strains (Mertens et af., 2007) are available
·Antigen detection ELISA systems have also been described
(Stanislawek et af., 1996; Hamblin et af., 1998)
·Serological tests for the detection of antibodies to the BTV
serogroup include CFT, indirect immunofluorescence and
competitive ELISA. Neutralization assays are used for
demonstrating type-specific
antibodies. In animals from endemic regions, a rising
antibody titre must be demonstrated using paired serum
samples.

.Live attenuated
vaccines have been used successfully for many years and
provide protection against virulent virus of homologous
serotype. Polyvalent vaccines are essential in regions
where a number of serotypes are present. Attenuated
vaccines may produce viraemia and may be teratogenic
when used in ewes during the first half of gestation. They
should not be used during periods of vector activity
because of the risk of transferring
vaccinalvirus to
pregnant ewes and the possibility of genetic reassortment
with field virus and reversion to virulence (Osburm et al.,
1996). Killed adjuvanted vaccines can induce protection
but are more expensive to produce and require two
inoculations. Recombinant virus-like particles, capable of
inducing protective immunity, have been produced in
insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses
expressing BTV proteins. However, vaccines produced by
this method are not yet available commercially.

Birnaviridae
Birnaviruses are so named because their genomes contain
two segments (A, B) of linear, double-stranded RNA.
Genetic reassortment has been described. The icosahedral
 ho        
polypeptides, designated VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5,
have been identified. The major capsid protein (VP2)
contains epitopes which induce neutralizing antibodies.
Replication occurs in the cytoplasm of host cells and
involves  a  virion-associated
1RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase. The family Birnaviridae contains four genera:
Avibirnavirus and Entomo-birnavirus,  which infect
chickens and insects respectively, while members of
Aquabirnavirus and Blosnavirus infect fish. Virions, which
are non-enveloped, are stable over a wide pH range and at
a temperature of 60?C for 1 hour. They are resistant to
treatment with ether and chloroform.
Clinical infections
Two economically important diseases associated with
birnaviruses are infectious bursal disease of chickens and
infectious pancreatic necrosis of salmonids. These diseases
occur worldwide and cause considerable losses in poultry
units and in farmed salmon.
Infectious bursal disease
1687
This condition is a highly contagious disease of young
chickens which is caused by infectious bursal disease virus
(IBDV). The causal agent was first isolated in Gumboro,
Delaware, and the disease was originally known as
Gumboro disease. Although turkeys and ducks are
chickens. Based on neutralization tests, isolates of IBDV
are assigned to two serotypes. There is considerable
variation in the virulence and antigenicity of serotype 1
isolates. Both‘very virulent’ (vv) strains and antigenic
variants have emerged
dinvaccinatedflocks.‘Very
virulent' strains were first reported in Europe and Asia in
the late 1980s. These strains, although antigenically similar
to classical serotype 1 strains, can cause disease even when
maternally-derived antibody against the classical vaccine
strains is present. Serotype 2 isolates are not associated
with clinical disease. A variety of antigenic variants are
recognized within each serotype. In the United States in
recent years, variant serotype 1 isolates have been detected
in flocks that had been vaccinated with classical strain
vaccines. These antigenic variants, which are highly
immunosuppressive in young chicks, cause rapid bursal
atrophy.

occurs
S when matermally-derived antibody  levels are
waning at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Virus is shed in the faeces
1689
for up to 2 weeks after infection and can remain infectious
in the environment of a poultry house for several months.
Spread to other poultry units can occur by fomites. Neither
a carrier state nor vertical transmission has been
demonstrated.
Pathogenesis
Within hours of ingestion, virus can be detected in
macrophages and lymphoid cells in the caeca, duodenum
and jejunum. Virus reaches the liver via the portal
circulation and infects Kupffer cells. Infection spreads to
the bursa of Fabricius where rapid replication results in a
pronounced secondary viraemia and dissemination to other
tissues. The main target cells are B lymphocytes and their
precursors in the bursa. The major antigenic protein, VP2,
has been shown to induce apoptosis in infected cells.
Depletion of B lymphocytes in early life results in
impaired humoral immune responses, lowered resistance to
infectious diseases and ineffective responses to vaccines.
In chickens older than 3 weeks of age, viral infection only
marginally affects immune competence because many B
lymphocytes are distributed throughout the tissues before
bursal damage occurs.
Clinical signs
The severity of clinical signs is influenced by the virulence
of the virus, the age of chicks at the time of infection, the
breed of the chicks and the level of matermnally-derived
antibody. Chicks develop an acute form of the disease,
usually between 3 and 6 weeks of age, following a short
incubation period. Affected birds are depressed and
1690
inappetent and show evidence of diarrhoea and vent
pecking. Morbidity ranges from 10% to 100% with a
mortality rate up to 20% or, occasionally, higher. The
course of the disease is short with surviving birds
recovering in about 4 days. Many outbreaks are mild,
detectableonlybyimpaired
1weightgains.Although
infections before 3 weeks of age are usually subclinical,
severe depression of antibody responses may result. In
general, the earlier in life infection occurs, the more
pronounced  the  immunosuppression.  Clinical  signs  in
these
e birds are usually vague. Suboptimal growth,
vaccination may be encountered.
Diagnosis
· In acute disease, clinical signs and a swollen oedematous
bursa at post-mortem are often sufficient for diagnosis.
Confirmation and identification of subclinicalinfection
require laboratory tests.
·Viral antigen can be detected in smears or frozen sections of
the bursa using immunofluorescence. Macerated bursal
tissue is suitable for detection of viral antigen by ELISA or
by gel diffusion tests. Antigen capture ELISA with suitable
monoclonal antibodies is capable of differentiating the very
virulent IBDV phenotype from less pathogenic types.
Specimens of bursa, spleen or faeces are suitable for virus
isolation. Most strains grow on the chorioal-lantoic
membrane of embryonated eggs. Classical and  variant
serotype l isolates can be differentiated using the virus
neutralization assay.
· Reverse transcriptase-PCR can be used for the diagnosis of
[BD, utilizing primers directed against the VP2 gene or the
VP1 gene.  Restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide
sequencing of PCR products are widely used for the
characterization of IBDV strains, particularly for the
1691
identification of vv[BDV. Real -time RT - PCR protocols are
available.
·Birds that have recovered from the acute disease develop
high antibody titres as mature peripheral B lymphocytes are
largely unaffected.  Suitable  serological  assays  include
ELISA and virus neutralization.
Control
Depopulation, thorough cleaning and effective disinfection
programmes are required following an outbreak of disease
in a unit. Most commercial units rely on vaccination for
control. Both modified live and inactivated serotype 1
vaccines are available. Live vaccines can be administered
by aerosol or in drinking water. Birds selected for breeding
are usually vaccinated at 4 to 10 weeks of age with a live
vaccine and again close to laying, with an inactivated
oil-adjuvanted  vaccine,  to ensure high  levels of
maternally-derived antibody in chicks. Vaccines used in
parent stock should contain both classical and variant
strains of IBDV. Chicks can be actively immunized after
maternally-derived antibody levels decline at about 4
weeks of age. In high-risk flocks, vaccination may begin at
day of age to protect birds with little or no
maternally-derived
1antibody, followed  by  booster
inoculations at 2 and 3 weeks of age. Partially attenuated
(hot') are generally used in this way in broilers and
commercial layer replacements as they are capable of
overcoming low levels of maternally-derived antibody.
Recent vaccine developments include in vitro expression
of VP2 gene and several recombinant vaccines using
suitable vectors such as turkey herpesvirus, fowl
adenovirus and fowlpox virus.

Orthomyxoviridae
The family Orthomyxoviridae (Greek orthos, proper, and
myxa, mucus) contains those viruses that cause influenza
in humans and animals. Orthomyxoviruses are spherical or
pleomorphic, enveloped viruses, 80 to 120 nm in diameter
(Fig. 71.1), but long filamentous forms also occur. The
envelope, which is derived from host cell membrane lipids.
contains glycosylated and non-glycosylated viral proteins.
Surface projections of glycoproteins form ‘spikes’ or
peplomers which, in influenza A and B viruses, are of two
types:ahaemagglutinin
(H)
responsible for virus
attachment and envelope fusion, and a neuraminidase (N)
capable of cleaving viral receptors, degrading mucus and
promoting both entry of virus into cells and release of
virions from infected cells

irradiation and oxidizing agents.
1694
The family contains five genera, namely Influenzavirus A,
Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus and
Isavirus. Influenza B and C viruses are primarily
pathogens of humans, although occasional infections of
pigs with influenza C virus have been described and
influenza B virus has been isolated from seals

Thogotovirus and Dhori virus are tick-borne arboviruses

Europe and Asia. Infectious salmon anaemia virus is an
important cause of disease in Atlantic salmon. Influenza A
virus, the most important member of the family, is a
significant pathogen of birds and mammals.
Isolates of influenza A virus are grouped into subtypes on
the basis of their H and N antigens. Currently, 16 H
antigens and nine N antigens are recognized (Fouchier et
al., 2005). New subtypes of influenza A virus emerge

development of new subtypes. To assess the risk posed by
the emergence of new variant viruses, a precise
international standard classification of isolates has been
adopted by the World Health Organization. This system is
based on the influenza virus type, host, geographical
origin, strain number, year of isolation and subtype. An
example of this classification system, influenza virus
A/equine/Prague/1/56 (H7N7), indicates that this virus was
isolated from a horse in Prague during 1956. Antigenic

Clinical infections
Influenza A viruses cause significant infections in humans,
pigs, horses and birds. Antibodies to influenza A virus
have been detected in cattle in association with respiratory
disease, but their significance is unclear (Brown et al.
1998). Aquatic birds, particularly
ducks which are
reservoirs of influenza A virus, provide a genetic pool for

The viruses replicate in the intestinal tract of birds and the
faecal-oral
route is considered the main route off
transmission. Human influenza pandemics have been
1697
attributed to the close association of concentrated human
populations with  domestic  fowl and  pigs.  Genetic
reassortment in these animal populations can lead to the
emergence of virulent influenza virus subtypes which are
capable of infecting humans, thereby initiating pandemics
(Fig. 71.2). Influenza viruses bind to sialic acid-galactose
disaccharides on the cell surface. Sialic acid can be linked
at positions 3 or 6 to the backbone of galactose. In humans.
Avian
influenza
viruses
bind
preferentially
to
α-2.3-linkages and accordingly have a low affinity for
human ciliated epithelium. Because pigs express both
types of linkages, human and avian influenza subtypes can
replicate readily  in porcine
ecells and thus pigsare
considered to be the species in which reassortment
(‘mixing vessel’ hypothesis) is most likely to occur
(Shortridge, 1997). Due to the fact that the genome of
influenza A virus is segmented, mixed infections can give
rise to genetic reassortment with the emergence of new
subtypes. Such novel subtypes have been implicated in
most major pandemics which have occurred to date. As
there is limited immunity to the new subtypes in the
human population, spread from country to country tends to
occur rapidly. It is estimated that the pandemic of ^Spanish
flu' in 1918 had a mortality rate of 2-20% and was
responsible for more than 40 million human deaths
worldwide. There is evidence to suggest that the cause of
the ‘Spanish flu' was an avian HiN1 influenza virus
(Taubenberger et al., 2005) that became adapted to
humans and swine. In contrast, both the 1957 H2N2 ^Asian
flu'and the 1968 H3N2‘Hong Kong flu’ human
pandemics were the result of reassortant viruses that
1698
contained both avian and human influenza virus genes. In
2009, a new pandemic strain of H1N1 influenza A began
circulating in humans (Zimmer and Burke, 2009). It

addition, two of the gene segments (neuraminidase and
matrix protein) of this new virus were similar to European
swine influenza A virus strains from 1992 (Babakir-Mina
et al., 2009). Pigs were considered to be the likely source
of this virus and were shown to be susceptible to infection
but circulation has occurred primarily in the human
population.

Less serious outbreaks of human influenza, which are of
relatively frequent occurrence, can be attributed to subtle
antigenic changes arising from errors during replication of
viral nucleic acid. If these subtypes exhibit antigenically
distinct haemagglutinins, they are less affected by existing
neutralizing antibodies and a proportion of the susceptible
population may become infected. Such outbreaks occur
abruptly, typically in the winter months in temperate
regions, and have a mortality rate of about 0.1%
Subtypes of influenza A virus, which are well established
as pathogens in animal populations, have also been
implicated in human infections. In 1976 an outbreak of
respiratory disease involving a swine influenza H1N1 virus
occurred in soldiers in Fort Dix, New Jersey. A large
vaccination campaign was mounted with 40 million doses
administered before the programme was halted. The virus
did not spread outside the military training base. In 1997,
following a large epidemic of avian influenza in chickens,
an H5N1 subtype was isolated from a fatal case in a young
child in Hong Kong. This subtype had not previously been
described outside of avian species. Human health fears
prompted the destruction of 1.2 million birds. Fortunately,
human-to-human transmission did not occur to any
significant extent, although other human cases did occur as
a result of contact with infected poultry. By the end of
1997, 18 human cases had been confirmed, six of which
were fatal. In 2002, a highly pathogenic subtype of H5N1,
capable of producing severe disease in domestic birds.
reappeared in Hong Kong. Spread of this subtype, believed
to have originated in southern China, marked the start of
an unprecedented epizootic of avian influenza involving
1701
a large number of countries across south-east Asia over
several years. Transmission has been principally related to
infection in parts of Africa and Europe may indicate a role
for the spread of virus by migrating wild birds. Cases of
human disease have been rare to date, but the case fatality
rate has been high at 60% (Abdel-Ghafar et al, 2008). The
virus has also infected tigers, leopards, domestic cats and
 o    p e so
expressed regarding the possibility of transmission of low
pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 isolates to humans
(Lupiani and Reddy, 2009).
Avian influenza (fowl plague)
Many combinations of H and N antigens in influenza A
virus are represented in isolates from avian species,
particularly waterfowl (Raleigh et al., 2009). Influenza A
virus subtypes are distributed  worldwide and are
frequently  recovered  from  clinically   normal  birds.
Outbreaks of severe clinical disease, caused by H5 and H7
subtypes, occur periodically in chickens and turkeys. In
these species, acute infection is referred to as fowl plague
or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and is
categorized as a listed disease by the OIE. All H5 and H7
isolates are notifiable. Phylogenetic studies have shown
close similarities between wild and domestic bird isolates
and indicate that clades and lineages of isolates are
associated with geographical and temporal factors
Epidemiology
1702
Infection is maintained in wild bird populations.
Waterfowl are considered to be responsible for introducing
the virus to domestic birds. Although ducks, particularly
juveniles, regularly become infected with influenza A
virus, they rarely show signs of illness. Following
replication in the intestinal tract, virus is shed in faeces.
Secondary spread can result from the movement of
personnel and  contaminated equipment between  poultry
farms, and live-bird markets may contribute to the spread

type of proteases present in a given tissue and the structure
of the viral haemagglutinin molecule. The production of
infectious virions requires post-translational cleavage of
the viral precursor haemagglutinin (HAo) molecule into a
disulphide-linked HAl-HA2 dimer to attain its full
biological potential. In the majority of influenza A virus
subtypes, haemag-glutinin is cleaved by particular host
    s s   
epithelial cells of the respiratory and digestive tracts. The
presence at the cleavage site of multiple basic amino acids.
arginine or lysine, renders haemagglutinins of virulent
subtypes susceptible to cleavage by intracellular host
proteases present in many tissues, thereby facilitating the
development of generalized infection.  It has  been
suggested that HPAI isolates arise by mutation from low
virulence isolates probably after the transfer of virus from
the natural wild bird host to poultry. Such change, which is
unpredictable, may occur soon after introduction or
1703
following several months of circulation of low pathogenic
avian influenza (LPAI) virus in poultry.
Clinical signs
The incubation period, which is variable, is up to 3 days in
naturally-infected individual birds and 14 days in the entire
flock. The incubation period is influenced by virus and
route of infection. Clinically, the disease may be
inapparent, mild or, in some instances, severe with high
mortality. Factors such as overcrowding, poor ventilation
and
1 concurrent
t  infections may  predispose  to  the
development of severe disease. Highly virulent subtypes
Clinical signs are more apparent in birds which survive for
a few days. Respiratory distress, diarrhoea, oedema in the
cranial region, cyanosis, sinusitis and lacrimation are
features of the clinical presentation. Infection of laying
birds results in a dramatic drop in egg production
Diagnosis
The severe form of the disease may be difficult to
distinguish from velogenic, viscerotropic Newcastle
disease or from fowl cholera. Mild forms of the disease
resemble other respiratory conditions in birds.
 Laboratory confirmation, which involves virus isolation and
characterization,
,is essential. Suitable specimens for
laboratory examination include tracheal and cloacal swabs,
faeces and pooled samples of organs.
Tissue suspensions are inoculated into 9 to 1l-day-old
embryonated eggs.  Allantoic fluid, harvested after
1704
incubation for 4 to 7 days, is tested for haemagglutinating
activity.
· The presence of influenza A virus can be confirmed by
immunodiffusion  using  a  suspension  of  chorioallantoic
membrane from eggs inoculated with material from an
outbreak and positive antiserum to the nucleocapsid or
matrix antigens common to all influenza A viruses.
·Antiserawith broad specificity may be used in
haemagglutination inhibition (Hl) or immunodiffusion tests
to confirm that an isolate is influenza A virus. Definitive
subtyping is performed by haemagglutination inhibition (HI)
and neura-minidase inhibition (NI) in reference laboratories
using monospecific antisera prepared against the 16
haemagglutinins and nine neuraminidase determinants.
·All highly virulent avian influenza A subtypes identified
possess either H5 or H7 antigens. However, numerous low
virulence H5 and H7 isolates have been recorded. To assess
pathogenicity, ten chickens 4 to 8 weeks of age should be
inoculated intravenously. [solates that cause more than 75%
mortality within 8 days or have an intravenous pathogenicity
index (IVPl) of greater than 1.2 are considered highly
pathogenic.
 Genomic sequencing can be used to determine the amino
acid composition at the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin
molecule. H5 and H7 isolates with an IVPI of less than 1.2
should be sequenced to determine if they have multiple basic
amino acids at the cleavage site of the precursor
haemagglutinin molecule as these are associated with
pathogenicity (Alexander, 2008).
RT-PCR techniques (Senne et af., 1996; Starick et af., 2000;
Munch et al, 200l) and real-time RT-PCR (Spackman et af.,
2002) are commonly employed for the rapid detection and
subtype identification of virus in clinical samples
particularly   for  the  rapid  identification  of  subsequent
 s sd   a  s
detected and the virus isolate characterized. Primers for
conserved sequences of the matrix protein gene are useful
for screening samples from a range of different species for
1705
all subtypes of the virus (Fouchier et al., 2000). Primers and
protocols are also available for the rapid and specific
detection of H5 and H7 subtypes of the virus (Slomka et af.,
2007).
· Commercial antigen immunoassays are available for the
detection of influenza A viruses in poultry (Slemons and
Brugh, 1998; Cattoli et af., 2004). The tests are rapid and
generally detect any influenza A virus, typically based on a
monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein. Because
these assays may lack sensitivity, their use should be
confined to flock testing.
· Serological testing for antibodies to influenza virus can be
carried out using an agar gel immunodiffusion test or
haemagglutination inhibition test or by competitive ELISA
(Shafer et af., 1998). A neurami-nidase inhibition test has
been developed as part of a DIVA (differentiating infected
from vaccinated animals) strategy (Capua et al., 2003).
Control
Outbreaks of avian influenza in domestic species are
notifiable to national regulatory authorities. In countries
free of the disease, outbreaks are controlled by slaughter of
affected flocks, imposition of movement restrictions and
implementation
of
 rigorous  disinfection  procedures.
Imported birds are quarantined. In high-risk areas along
the migration routes of waterfowl, poultry should be
housed in bird-proof buildings.
Vaccination is usually prohibited in those countries
implementing a slaughter policy because of international
trade restrictions and possible difficulties in establishing
freedom from infection. Some countries accept the
presence of mildly pathogenic subtypes because of the
expense of implementing control measures. In such
countries, inactivated oil emulsion vaccines are available
1706
commercially and are used, particularly in turkeys, to
protect against subtypes of low virulence. Recombinant
haemagglutinin protein vaccines and recombinant fowlpox
virus vector vaccines containing a haemagglutinin gene
insert have been developed (Swayne et al., 1997; Crawford
et al., 1999).
Vaccines that are effective against a particular virulent
influenza A subtype may not be effective against new
emerging subtypes. Because of the risk of reversion to
        s
used. However, clinical trials in humans with an
attenuated, cold- adapted, reassortant influenza virus
vaccine have produced good results (Couch, 2000) and
may lead to the development of similar vaccines for
poultry
Swine influenza
This highly contagious disease of pigs occurs worldwide.
Swine influenza was first described in 1918, its occurrence
coinciding with a major pandemic of human influenza. The
      o 
H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2. Frequently two or more subtypes
circulate in a pig population. In Europe during 1979, H1N1
isolates, clearly distinguishable from classical HlN1
subtypes and with haemagglutinins structurally similar to
     
subtypes, which are more virulent than classical HlNl
isolates, now predominate in Europe. The H3N2 virus is a
triple
reassortantcontaining
haemagglutinin
  and
neuraminidase proteins from a human influenza virus and
internal proteins from porcine, avian and human viruses,
1707
while the H1N2 subtype is a triple reassortant comprised
of an HA of human origin, an NA of swine H3N2 origin
and intermal proteins of avian-like swine
H1Nl viruses. A novel H3N1 subtype has recently been
described in pigs in Korea, Italy and the USA. It has been
suggested that pigs may act as a ‘mixing vessel’ with
transfer of virulent reassortant subtypes from pigs to
humans resulting in pandemics in the human population
(Fig. 71.2).
Epidemiology
An outbreak of swine influenza is usually associated with
the recent introduction of pigs into a herd. Virus, shed in
high concentrations in the nasal secretions of infected pigs,
spreads rapidly within a herd. The principal route of
transmission is by direct contact. Airborne spread between
farms may occur under suitable weather conditions in
areas with high pig populations. Outbreaks of disease
usually occur when environmental temperatures are low.
Between outbreaks, it is probable that virus circulates in
herds without evidence of clinical disease and that
        
related to the continual availability of susceptible animals.
Pigs housed in multiple age groups are at greater risk of
acquiring infection with swine influenza virus than those
of uniform age (Poljak et al., 2008).
Pathogenesis and pathology
Infection is limited to the respiratory tract; the lungs are
the major target organs. Following infection, virus
multiplies in nasal, tracheal and bronchial epithelium.
1708
Spread of infection throughout the respiratory tract may
result in necrosis, extensive pneumonic change and
consolidation. Experimental inoculation of some swine
influenza virus isolates demonstrated very low virulence
and resulted in minor histological changes without gross
post-mortem lesions (Ferrari et al., 2010). Lesions are
often limited to the apical and cardiac lobes. The acute
phase of the disease persists for more than 72 hours after
which virus replication declines.
Clinical signs
Onset of the disease in a herd is often abrupt, many pigs
becoming clinically ill simultaneously. The incubation
period is up to 4 days. The severity of the illness ranges
from subclinical to acute and is strongly influenced by the
strain of the infecting virus. Secondary bacterial infections
frequently complicate the course of the disease and delay
recovery. Acute disease is characterized by huddling in
groups, paroxysmal coughing, dyspnoea and fever, while
  n     s 
Most pigs recover within 6 days. Although morbidity is
high, mortality is usually low except in very young pigs or
when intercurrent infection is present. The economic
impact of the disease is mainly attributable to loss of
weight, while in fully susceptible herds abortion can occur
in affected sows (Karasin et al., 2002)
Diagnosis
· Samples suitable for virus isolation include nasal mucus and
lung tissue collected from acute cases early in the disease.
As the virus is labile, transport media should be used for
1709
rapid transfer of specimens to the laboratory. Isolation is
performed in  embryonated eggs  or cell  culture.  After
incubation for 72 hours, haemagglutinating activity is
demonstrable in the allantoic fluid.
· Demonstration of a rise in antibody levels in paired serum
samples using haemagglutination-inhibition test or ELISA
 procedures is indicative of infection.
Viral antigen can be detected using immunofluorescence or
ELISA.
Viral nucleic acid can be detected with RT-PCR (Fouchier et
af., 2000) and real time RT-PCR (Richt et al., 2004).
Control
Good husbandry, including the elimination of stress
factors, may help to minimize losses from swine influenza.
Depopulation is the only means of eliminating infection.
and an all-in/all-out management system is the best
measure to prevent the introduction of infection.
Inactivated    vaccines   are    available    commercially.
Vaccination can be beneficial provided that the subtypes of
virus incorporated in vaccines include those involved in
the outbreaks (Thacker and Janke, 2008)
Equine influenza
This economically important, acute respiratory disease of
horses has occurred worldwide with the exception of a
small number of countries such as New Zealand and
the first time. Two immunologically distinct subtypes of
influenza A virus are described in horses. The first virus,
isolated from horses in 1956, was designated A/equine/
Prague/1/56 (H7N7) or influenza A/equine 1. In 1963, a
second subtype was isolated in the USA and designated
1710
A/equine/Miami/2/63 (H3N8) or influenza A/equine2
Infection or vaccination with one subtype does not induce
protection against infection  with  the other subtype
Although the last outbreak of disease attributed to
influenza A/ equine 1 occurred in 1979, there is serological
evidence that this subtype continues to circulate in the
horse population.
Antigenic drift accounts for several variants of influenza
A/equine 2 with two antigenically and genetically distinct
et al., 1998). However, considerable crossover of viruses,
of both lineages, from the two continents has been
recorded. Both North American and European lineages of
H3N8 have been detected in horses in China. In contrast,
an H3N8 subtype isolated from horses in China in 1989
was more closely related to avian strains than to the H3N8
subtype circulating in horses in other countries. Outbreaks
of influenza in greyhounds have been associated with
isolates closely related to H3N8 equine influenza virus
(Crawford et al., 2005).
Epidemiology
Outbreaks are associated with movement and assembly of
horses for shows, sales, racing or training. The initial
source of infection is often a partially immune horse
shedding virus without showing clinical signs. Equine
influenza is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among
susceptible horses. Large quantities of virus are shed in
aerosols by the frequent coughing of affected animals.
  h    p  s 
windborme aerosol
(Davis et al.,  2009). Indirect
1711
transmission through contamination of clothing, equipment
and vehicles can also occur.
Pathogenesis
The virus replicates in the epithelium of the respiratory
tract resulting in destruction of ciliated epithelium within 4
to 6 days and hypersecretion from submucosal glands. This
destruction of ciliated epithelial cells is a result of
apoptosis triggered by infection of cells by equine
influenza virus.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is usually 1 to 3 days with a range
of 18 hours to 5 days, the length of incubation being
inversely related to the infecting dose (Newton and
Mumford, 2004). The disease is characterized by pyrexia,
nasal discharge, dry cough, anorexia and depression. It is
frequently associated with secondary bacterial infections
(Newton et al., 2006). Ocular discharge, limb oedema and
      
clinical signs and the likelihood of secondary bacterial
infection with
 the  development   of  respiratory
complications. Exercise exacerbates the clinical signs
(Gross et al., 1998). Animals with mild infections usually
recover within 3 weeks. In severe cases, several months
may be required for convalescence. Excretion of virus has
been reported to last from 7 to 10 days in fully susceptible
horses.
Diagnosis
1712
Although clinical signs may be suggestive of equine
influenza, laboratory confirmation is required.
· Nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the acute phase of
the infection are suitable for isolation of the virus in
embryonated eggs or in cell culture. New isolates should be
closely monitored for antigenic drift.
·A commercial diagnostic kit, developed for the detection of
the nucleoprotein of human influenza A virus, can be used
for the diagnosis of equine influenza (Chambers et af.,
1994).
· Viral nucleic acid can be demonstrated using RT-PCR
(Donofrio et af., 1994; Oxburgh and Hagstrom, 1999;
Fouchier et af., 2000) and real-time RT-PCR (Quinlivan et
af., 2005; Lu et af., 2009).
· Serological diagnosis of equine influenza is possible.
Haemagglutination inhibition or single radial haemolysis
tests on paired serum samples can be used for diagnosis.
Serum used in the Hl test must be pretreated in order to
remove non-specific inhibitors.
Treatment and control
Supportive therapy and rest are indicated for affected
horses. The antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine
have been shown to be effective for inhibiting replication
of influenza A virus in vitro. Several inactivated vaccines
are commercially available which are effective in reducing
the severity of clinical signs and shedding of virus (Paillot
et al.,2010). However, immunity is usually short-lived and
booster injections are required in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions. The incorporation of polymer
adjuvants or Quil-A-based immuno-stimulating complexes
(ISCOMs) into vaccine preparations extends the duration
of protective levels of immunity. Commercial recombinant
canarypoxvirus vaccines expressing the haemagglutinin
1713
gene of A/equine 2 have been tested and used during the
successful control and eradication programme for equine
influenza in Australia in 2007 (Garmer et al., 2010).
Serological assays capable of differentiating infected from
vaccinated animals (DIVA) are applicable with this
vaccine.   Protective  immunity   generated   by  natural
exposure is related both to a mucosal IgA immune
 ‘sasuodsa qan pu eohn [ony o pu asuodsa
patterm of  protective
immunity not generated by
conventional vaccines
(Nelson et al., 1998). Vaccinated horses generally exhibit
milder clinical signs and shed virus for shorter periods than
unvaccinated animals. Vaccine manufacturers must update
vaccinal strains regularly and vaccines should include
antigenic material representative of the influenza A virus
subtypes prevalent in the horse population. Current
commercial vaccines contain strains of both lineages of
H3N8 as well as H7N7, and have been shown to give
broad  cross-protection  when  circulating antibodies are
sufficiently high (Park et al., 2004).
The rate of mutation is likely to be increased by
vaccination (Newton and Mumford, 2004). For this reason,
it is considered necessary to update the strains of equine
influenza used in vaccine production every 3 to 5 years
(Anon.-EU-EI, 1998). In addition to vaccination, contro]
of equine influenza requires isolation of affected horses
and cleaning, disinfection and isolation of infected
premises.  Animal   movement   should   cease  until
contaminated premises have been cleaned and disinfected.

Paramyxoviridae
Paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses were formerly
grouped together as the ‘myxoviruses’ (Greek myxa,
mucus), a name which describes their affinity for mucous
membranes. Paramyxoviruses are pleomorphic, 150 nm or
more in diameter and enveloped (Fig. 72.1). They contain
a single molecule of negativesense, single-stranded RNA.
Two types of glycoprotein
‘spikes' or peplomers are
present in the envelope: an attachment protein and a fusion
protein (F). The attachment protein may be either a
haemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) or a protein
without neuraminidase
activity (G).The  attachment
proteins allow the virus to bind to cell surface receptors
and the fusion protein causes the virus envelope to fuse
with the host cell membrane. Both types of peplomers can
induce production of virus-neutralizing antibodies. There
is also an envelope-associated non-glycosylated membrane
protein
(M).
Paramyxoviruses
may
exhibit
haemagglutinating,
haemolytic
and
neuraminidase
activities. The nucleocapsid, which has helical symmetry,
is 13 to 18 nm in diameter and has a characteristic
cytoplasm. Virions are released by budding from the
plasma membrane at sites containing virus envelope
proteins. The labile virions are sensitive to heat,
desiccation, lipid solvents, non-ionic detergents and
disinfectants.

Rinderpest
1725
This acute disease, which occurs primarily in ruminants
and is also referred to as cattle plague, has been recognized
for centuries as a major cause of mortality in cattle and
domestic buffalo. Originally an Asian disease, devastating
outbreaks in Europe resulted in the foundation of the first
veterinary school in Lyon in 176l. Following its
introduction into the Horm of Africa a devastating outbreak
followed throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the last
decadeofthenineteenth
century.Rinderpest  was
considered endemic in the Somali pastoral ecosystem
which straddles the borders of Kenya, Ethiopia and
Somalia. However, the virus has not been confirmed in this
area since 2o0l. The virus is considered to have been
eradicated from its traditional homeland of central Asia
and also from Africa. It is classed as a listed disease by the
World Organization for Animal Health, also known as
Office International des Epizooties (OIE).
Epidemiology
Although only one serotype of this morbillivirus is
recognized, strains differ in both host range and virulence.
Individual host species exhibit differences in susceptibility
to virus strains. Domestic cattle, buffalo and several
wildlife species including giraffe, warthog, Cape buffalo
and eland are highly susceptible to infection. Gazelles and
small domestic ruminants are less susceptible. Asiatic
breeds of domestic pig develop disease whereas infection
in European breeds is sub-clinical. Transmission, which
occurs through aerosols, usually requires close contact as
the virus is labile and remains viable in the environment
for short periods only. Virus shedding in all secretions and
excretions begins a few days before clinical signs develop.
1726
In endemic areas, the disease is usually mild and is
restricted to young cattle in which maternally-derived
immunity has declined. As there is no carrier state,
maintenance of infection requires continuous transmission
to susceptible animals. Transmissibility and virulence of
the virus are directly related. During epidemics, selection
of virulent, highly transmissible virus occurs, with
shedding of large quantities of virus from infected animals.
The absence of highly susceptible hosts in endemic areas
results in the selection of milder strains of virus.
Epidemicsusually
 occur   following   movement
t of
susceptibleanimals
into an endemic area or the
introduction    of   infected   animals   into    susceptible
populations. All ages of animals are affected in epidemics
Morbidity may reach 90% and mortality can approach
100%.
Pathogenesis
After inhalation of the virus, multiplication occurs in the
pharyngeal   and  mandibular  lymph   nodes.   Viraemia
develops within 3 days, resulting in spread to other
lymphoid tissues and to the mucosae of the respiratory and
digestive tracts.  Leukopenia and immunosuppression
follow necrosis in lymphoid tissues. Virus shedding, which
continues throughout the acute phase of the disease,
subsides a few days after body temperature returns to
normal.
Clinical signs
After an incubation period of 3 to 9 days, infected animals
develop a fever and become anorexic and depressed
1727
Mucosal erosions in the mouth and nasal passages become
evident within 5 days. Profuse salivation is accompanied
by an oculonasal discharge. About 3 days after the
appearance of the mucosal ulcers, fever regresses and a
profuse diarrhoea develops. The dark fluid faeces often
contain mucus, necrotic debris and blood. Dehydration and
wasting soon become evident. Severely affected animals
may collapse and die within 12 days of the onset of clinical
signs. In surviving animals, convalescence lasts several
weeks. Secondary infections and activation of latent
protozoal infections are frequent complications. Pregnant
animals may abort during the convalescent period.

found
throughout  the  gastrointestinal  tract  with  characteristic
congestion and haemorrhage along the longitudinal folds

regions
where rinderpest
is  uncommon  or  absent,
laboratory confirmation is required to differentiate it from
bovine viral diarrhoea, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis,
malignant catarrhal fever and foot-and-mouth disease.
When investigating an outbreak, specimens for laboratory
1730
examination should be collected from several febrile
animals which have not developed diarrhoea.
 Specimens suitable for virus isolation include white cells
from the buffy coat of heparinized blood samples, lymph
node and spleen.

suspected rinderpest (Bruning et al., 1999).
·A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method,
which can detect rinderpest virus and differentiate it from
the virus of peste des petits ruminants, has been developed
(Forsyth and Barrett, 1995)
       
rinderpest virus is the test recommended by OIE for
international trade.
· Post mortem enteric lesions are characteristic but not
pathognomonic. Congestion of the folds of the colonic
mucosa often produces a zebra-stripe pattern.
 Syncytia may form in stratified squamous epithelium of the
upper alimentary tract and in crypts of the small intestine.
Control
The Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme of the Food
and Agricultural Organization (FAO) was begun in 1994
to achieve worldwide eradication of rinderpest. It was
declared a success in 2010, making this only the second
virus (after smallpox virus) to be eradicated. Factors which
1731
developed by Walter Plowright that induces lasting
immunity, reliable diagnostic tests and the absence of
carrier animals and wildlife reservoirs.
In countries free of rinderpest, control is based on
restriction of animal movement, quarantine of imported
animals and slaughter of infected animals. In endemic
areas, control is achieved by vaccination of domestic cattle
and buffaloes with a modified live tissue-culture-based
vaccine that induces immunity lasting at least 5 years. This
stable  freeze-dried  vaccine  is  thermolabile  following
reconstitution. Recombinant vaccinia and capripoxvirus
vaccines expressing either haemagglutinin protein or
A        
and have been used to protect cattle (Inui et al, 1995;
Ngichabe et al, 1997). Control of animal movement is the
single most important measure for preventing disease
transmission.
Peste des petits ruminants
This condition, also referred to as goat plague, is an acute
contagious disease of small ruminants, particularly goats.
It is caused by the morbillivirus, peste des petits ruminants
virus (PPRV), which is closely related to other members of
the genus. Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), which occurs
in sub-Saharan Africa north of the equator, the Middle
East, India and Pakistan, is an OIE-listed disease.
Epidemiology
Close contact is required for transmission of this labile
virus which occurs by aerosols. The introduction of
1732
infection into a flock is invariably associated with
movement of animals. Although a carrier state is not
known to occur, subclinical infection and the onset of viral
shedding before overt clinical signs facilitate spread of
infection. In West Africa, epidemics tend to occur during
the rainy season, when flocks are gathered together in
preparation for sales. Infection rates are similar in sheep
and goats but the disease is generally more severe in goats.
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of PPR is similar to that of rinderpest
Mucosal erosions and profuse diarrhoea are features of the
condition. During the acute phase of the disease, virus is
shed in all secretions and excretions.
Clinicalsigns
The incubation period is about 4 days. The disease is
particularly severe in young animals. Affected goats
exhibit fever, dry muzzle and a serous nasal discharge
which becomes mucopurulent. Erosions on the mucous
membrane of the buccal cavity are accompanied by
marked salivation. Ulcers develop in the mucosae of the
alimentary, respiratory and urinary tracts. Conjunctivitis
with ocular discharge is a feature of the disease. A profuse
diarrhoea, which results in dehydration, develops within
days of infection. Signs of tracheitis and pneumonia are
common. There is a severe leukopenia which facilitates
secondary bacterial infection. Pulmonary infections caused
by Pasteurella species are common in the later stages of
the disease. Pregnant animals may abort. Mortality rates in
1733
severe outbreaks often exceed 70% and acutely affected
goats may die within 10 days of exposure to the virus.
In sheep, infection with PPRV, which tends to be less
severe than in goats, is characterized by fever, nasal
catarrh, mucosal erosions and intermittent diarrhoea.
Affected animals usually recover after 10 to 14 days.
Diagnosis
Specimens for laboratory examination should be taken
from animals in the acute phase of the disease. Suitable
specimens include nasal and ocular swabs, unclotted blood
and scrapings of buccal and rectal mucosae. Samples of
lung, spleen and lymph node from animals slaughtered
early in the course of the disease are also suitable.
Laboratory  confirmation  is based primarily on  virus
isolation in tissue culture and on antigen detection. Rapid
antigen  detection  methods  include ELISA,  counter
immunoelectrophoresis  and   agar   gel  immunodiffusion.
Specific primers for use in RT-PCR are available.
Antibodies can be detected by virus neutralization or by
competitive ELISA.
Control
Slaughter policies apply in countries free from PPR
Quarantine and vaccination are used in regions where the
disease is endemic. Modified live rinderpest vaccine,
which induces adequate protection against PPRV, has been
used in sheep and goats for many years. A modified live
PPRV vaccine has also been developed.
1734
Canine distemper
This  highly
ycontagious disease of dogs and other
carnivores has a worldwide distribution. Canine distemper
virus (CDV), a pantropic morbillivirus, produces a
 generalized infection involving many organ systems.
Epidemiology
The wide host range of CDV includes members of the
families Canidae, Ailuridae, Hyaenidae, Mustelidae,
Procyonidae, Ursidae, Viverridae and Felidae. Outbreaks
of disease have been documented in several wildlife
species including foxes, skunks, racoons, black-footed
ferrets
and
lions
(Appel
1and
Summers, 1995;
Roelke-Parker et al., 1996). The virus is relatively labile.
requiring transmission by direct contact or by aerosols. In
urban dog populations, the virus is maintained by infection
of susceptible animals. Infection spreads rapidly among
young dogs, usually between 3 and 6 months of age, when
maternally-derived immunity declines. The number of
dogs in populations in rural areas is often too low to
maintain continuous infection with the result that,
irrespective of age, unvaccinated dogs are susceptible and
significant outbreaks of the disease can occur.
Pathogenesis
The virus, which replicates in the upper respiratory tract.
spreads to the tonsils and bronchial lymph nodes. A
cell-associated viraemia follows with spread to other
lymphoreticular   tissues.
Viral    replication    produces
lymphocytolysis
 and
leukopenia
resulting
in
1735
immunosuppression which facilitates a secondary viraemia
to develop. The extent of spread to tissues and organs is
determined by the rapidity and effectiveness of  the
immune response. In the absence of a sufficiently vigorous
response, dissemination and replication of CDV occurs in
the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary and
Icentral
nervous systems. Spread to the skin may also occur.
Virus infects both neurons and glial cells within the CNS
and may persist there for very long periods. Old dog
encephalitis  is apparently associated  with prolonged
persistence of the virus in the brain, possibly as a result of
non-cytolytic spread from cell to cell without budding
from the cell membrane, thus evading immune detection

analogous  tothatcausing

persistent infection with defective measles virus. The
presence of viral antigen in these conditions stimulates a

extend to 4 weeks or more when nervous signs appear

enlargement become evident. Coughing, vomiting and
diarrhoea are often consequences of secondary infections.
A skin rash and pustules may be present on the abdomen.
Some affected dogs have hyperkeratosis of the nose and
footpads, referred to as “hardpad'. Acute disease, which
may last for a few weeks, is followed either by recovery
andlife-long immunity
or
by the development of
neurological  signs and,
eventually, death. Common
neurological   signs 
include
paresis,
， myoclonus and
seizures. The convulsions may begin as petit mal chewing
gum’ fits where the animal salivates and makes chewing
movements with the jaws before convulsions become more
frequent and severe, resulting in grand mal epileptiform
seizures. A grave prognosis is indicated in animals
displaying neurological disturbance. Residual neurological
deficits are common in dogs that survive. Old dog
encephalitis, characterized by motor and behavioural
deterioration, is invariably fatal.
Diagnosis
A febrile, catarrhal illness with neurological sequelae in
young dogs is highly suggestive of canine distemper.
·Viral antigen may be demonstrated by immunofluorescence
in conjunctival or vaginal impression smears or in smears of
cells from the buffy coat.
·Cryostat sections of lymph nodes, urinary bladder and
cerebellum are also suitable for the demonstration of viral
antigen.
· Eosinophilic inclusions can be demonstrated in nervous and
epithelial tissues.
1737
·Sensitive molecular methods for the detection of CDV RNA
in clinical samples include one-step, nested and real-time
RT-PCR (Frisk et af., 1999; Kim et af., 200l; Shin et af,
2004; Elia et al., 2006). Retrospective diagnosis using a
semi-nested RT-PCR on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue is also possible (Stanton et af., 2002). Six major
genetic lineages, America-1 and-2, Asia-1 and-2, European
and Arctic, have been identified, based on sequencing of the
H gene (Martella et al., 2007). Commercial vaccines
typically contain strains from the America-1 lineage.
Serologicaldemonstrationof eitherIgMantibodies or a
fourfold rise in  antibody  titre between acute and
convalescent sera may be determined by virus neutralization,
ELISA or indirect immunofluorescence. Antibody may be
detected in cerebrospinal fluid.

Control
Modified live vaccines, which are available commercially,
provide adequate protection when administered to pups
after   matermally-derived  antibody   has   declined   to
negligible levels, usually after 12 weeks of age. Most CDV
vaccines are produced from egg-adapted or avian cell
culture-adapted virus (Onderstepoort strain) or from canine
cell culture-adapted virus (Rockborn strain). Because
post-vaccinal encephalitis has been reported occasionally
following the use of canine cell culture-adapted strains, the
avian cell culture-adapted strain is considered to be safer.

moderate levels   of  matermally-derived antibody. A
recombinant canarypox virus expressing CDV envelope
1738
glycoproteins has been shown to be an effective vaccine
(Larson and Schultz, 2006). Following successful
vaccination, dogs remain immune for several years and
booster vaccinations are recommended every 3 years (Gore
et al., 2005). Because of the labile nature of the virus,
control can be achieved after an outbreak of disease in
kennels by strict isolation and disinfection
Infections caused by other morbilliviruses
During the late 1980s, serious outbreaks of a disease, with
clinical and  pathological features  similar  to  canine
distemper, were recorded in the seal populations,
particularly harbour seals, in the Baltic and the North Sea.
The interest generated by these disease outbreaks of viral
       n
new morbilliviruses including phocine distemper virus and
cetacean distemper  virus. Serological evidence  of
morbillivirus infection has been recorded in several
cetacean species.
Hendra and Nipah viruses
During an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in horses
in Australia during
g1994, Hendra virus, originally
considered to be an equine morbillivirus, was isolated.
Two humans in contact with infected horses were also
affected. Fourteen horses and their trainer died. Sporadic
cases with acute onset, fever accompanied by either
respiratory or neurological signs and high mortality rates
are reported periodically. A related virus, Nipah virus, was
isolated in Malaysia during 1999 following outbreaks of
disease in pigs and humans working in affected pig units.
1739
The disease, which caused a febrile encephalitis, resulted
 s   ' n s on   
Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered to be Pteropus
species of bats (flying foxes). As a consequence of the
discovery of these two viruses, a new genus, Henipavirus.
has been created within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae.
Newcastle disease
A large number of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) isolates
has been recorded worldwide from a range of domestic and
wild birds. Nine species of antigenically distinct APMV
are currently recognized in the genus Avulavirus. New
isolates are assigned to a species on the basis of antigenic
relatedness in haemagglutination inhibition tests. Although
infections with most avian paramyxovirses are associated
with mild or inapparent disease, infections with APMV-2
and APMV-3 cause respiratory disease in turkeys.
The most important avian paramyxovirus is Newcastle
disease virus (NDV), also designated avian paramyxovirus
1 (APMV-l), which causes Newcastle disease. This
disease occurs in poultry worldwide. Newcastle disease
was first described in 1926 when severe outbreaks were
reported in Newcastle, England, and in Java. Other major
outbreaks of the disease occurred in the Middle East
during the late 1960s and in the 1970s when pigeons were
the species primarily affected.
Epidemiology
A wide range of avian species including chickens, turkeys,
pigeons, pheasants, ducks and geese is susceptible.
1740
Infection with NDV is probably endemic in wild birds
especially waterfowl (Takakuwa et al., 1998). Strains of
NDV differ in their virulence. On the basis of virulence
and tissue tropism in poultry, isolates are categorized into
five groups or pathotypes:
· Viscerotropic velogenic isolates causing severe fatal disease
characterized by haemorrhagic intestinal lesions (Doyle's
form)
· Neurotropic velogenic isolates causing acute disease
characterized by nervous and respiratory signs with high
mortality (Beach's form)
· Mesogenic isolates causing mild disease with mortality
confined to young birds (Beaudette's form)
· Lentogenic isolates causing mild or inapparent respiratory
infection (Hitchner’s form)
·Asymptomatic enteric isolates associated with sub-clinical
intestinal infection by lentogenic strains.
These clinical forms overlap and, in addition to the
pathogenicity of the NDV isolate, factors such as the host
species, dose, age of bird and environmental conditions
influence the severity of clinical signs. It appears that
virulent strains may arise from progenitor viruses of low
virulence following passage in chickens (Shengqing et al.,
2002). Virus is shed in all excretions and secretions.
Transmission usually occurs by aerosols or by ingestion of
contaminated feed or water. The relative stability of the
virus permits mechanical transfer of infective material
through the movement of personnel and equipment. Virus,
which can survive in carcasses for some weeks, is present
in all organs of acutely affected birds and in eggs.
Captive and wild birds can contribute to the spread of
infection. Pigeons are susceptible to all strains of NDV and
1741
may play a role in the transmission of Newcastle disease.
Mesogenic isolates, which can be distinguished from other
NDV isolates using monoclonal antibodies, were obtained
from racing pigeons in Europe during the early 1980s.
These isolates, often referred to as ^pigeon’ paramyxovirus
1, are associated with clinical disease in pigeons
resembling the neurotropic form of Newcastle disease.
Kingdom during 1984 were linked to feed contaminated by
infected feral pigeons.
Pathogenesis
Viral replication, which occurs initially in the epithelia of
the respiratory and intestinal tracts, is followed by
haematogenous spread to the spleen and bone marrow.
Secondary viraemia results in infection of other organs
including lungs, intestine and CNS. The extent of spread
within the body relates to strain virulence which is
determined by the amino acid sequence of the F
glycoprotein. The fusion (F) glycoprotein of NDV is
synthesized in an infected cell as a precursor molecule (Fo)
which is cleaved by host cell proteases to F1 and F2
subunits. If cleavage fails to occur, non-infectious particles
are produced. The Fo molecules of virulent strains of NDV
possess basic amino acids at critical positions which
P      s   
tissues. In contrast, the replication of lentogenic strains is
confined to the respiratory and intestinal epithelia where
suitable trypsin-like proteases are produced.
Clinical signs
1742
The incubation period is usually about 5 days. Respiratory,
gastrointestinal and nervous signs occur in chickens. The
particular clinical presentation relates to the virulence of
the virus strain, its tissue tropism and the age and immune
status of the host. Highly virulent strains may produce
sudden high mortality in a flock in the absence of
premonitory clinical signs. The mortality rate in fully
susceptible flocks may be close to 1oo%. When present,
signs in these flocks include listlessness, weakness and a
produce respiratory signs such as gasping and rales,
oedema of the head and neck and greenish diarrhoea. Birds
that survive the acute phase may develop neurological
signs. Infection with neurotropic velogenic strains results
wing paralysis, leg paralysis, torticollis and muscle
spasms.  Mesogenic  strains usually cause respiratory
disease. Lentogenic strains do not produce disease in adult
birds but may produce respiratory signs in young birds.
   o s s n o 
turkeys, which usually involves the respiratory and central
nervous systems, is less severe than that in chickens.
Pigeons infected with ' pigeon' paramyxovirus 1 present
with neurological signs and diarrhoea, and mortality in
affected birds may approach 10%. Clinical infections have
also been described in cormorants and geese
Humans may develop a transitory conjunctivitis if exposed
to high concentrations of NDV.
Diagnosis
1743
A presumptive clinical diagnosis may be made when the
characteristic signs and lesions associated with virulent
strains are present. Laboratory confirmation by isolation
and identification of the virus is necessary.
·Tracheal and cloacal swabs from live birds are suitable for
virus isolation. Suitable post-mortem
specimens for laboratory examination include  faeces,
intestinal contents and portions of trachea, intestine, spleen,
brain and lung. Samples may be stored at 4°C for up to 4
days.
Virus isolation is carried out in embryonated eggs from
specific pathogen-free (SPF) flocks, usually by inoculation
into the allantoic cavity. After incubation, allantoic fluid is
tested for haemagglutination activity.
· Haemagglutination-inhibition test using specific antiserum
confirms the presence of NDV.
· Virulence of NDV isolates is assessed using in vivo tests
including the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPl) and
the intravenous pathogenicity index in SPF chicks. The
pathogenicity index is the mean score per bird per
observation over an 8-or 10- day observation period. The
q sy sa pa ssn (a) a yp u
employed to classify isolates as velogenic (embryonic death
(ED) in less than 60 hours), mesogenic (ED between 60 and
90 hours) and lentogenic (ED after more than 90 hours). The
current OIE definition for reporting an outbreak of ND is
   o s    l  
least three) basic amino acids at the C-terminus of the F2
 protein and phenylalanine at residue 117 (N-terminus of the
F1 protein).
· Molecular techniques are increasingly being used for the
detection of NDV in clinical specimens (Gohm et al., 2000;
Creelan et al, 2002). Primers are usually selected to cover
the cleavage site of the Fo protein gene, thus providing
information on the virulence of the virus detected
1744
      ( )
successfully in ND outbreaks (Wise et af., 2004).
·Demonstration of antibody to NDV is of diagnostic value
only
in
unvaccinated
flocks.
The
haemagglutination-inhibition test is the most widely used
assay. Commercial ELISA kits are available.
 Demonstration of viral antigen in tracheal sections or
impression smears using immunofluorescence is a less
sensitive technique than virus isolation.
Control
General control measures include locating poultry farms
several kilometres apart, bird-proofing of houses and feed
stores, controlled access to farms, thorough cleaning and
disinfection of vehicles and equipment and restriction of
movement  between  poultry
1 farms.  National  control
policies for Newcastle disease differ from country to
  o    o
slaughter of infected flocks. A combination of vaccination
and slaughter policies is frequently employed. Vaccination
Lentogenic or mesogenic strains of NDV propagated in
eggs or tissue culture are used in live vaccines. They are
administered as a spray, in drinking water or by intranasal
or  intraconjunctival   instillation.  The   presence
of
matermally-derived antibodies interferes with the efficacy
of live vaccines. In order to avoid this undesirable effect,
vaccination should be delayed until 2 to 4 weeks of age
when most birds will be susceptible, or alternatively live
vaccine can be administered to day-old chicks by
conjunctival instillation or by a coarse spray with large
droplets in order to ^seed’ a flock with vaccinal virus. This
method, which may result in respiratory disease in fully
1745
susceptible birds, establishes active infection in some birds
that persists until maternally-derived immunity has waned
sufficiently in the rest of the birds to allow infection to
develop. Revaccination is normally carried out 3 to 4
weeks later. A schedule of vaccination employing both live
and inactivated vaccines gives good results. Vaccinated
birds, although protected from clinical disease, can be
infected with wild-type virus and become shedders.
Several recombinant vaccines employing different vector
viruses have been developed
Blue eye disease in pigs
This condition, caused by porcine rubulavirus, was first
observed in pigs during 1980 in Mexico. Blue eye disease
is characterized by neurological signs and corneal opacity
in young pigs and reproductive failure in adults. Morbidity
and mortality are highest in young pigs. Diagnosis is based
on clinical signs, histopathological changes and serological
testing of paired serum samples. Suitable tests for the
detection
of
antibodies
include
haemagglutination-inhibition,
ELISA
and
virus
neutralization.  Methods  aimed
at
preventing
the
introduction of the infection include strict isolation
procedures   combined
with
1 serological testing
of
replacement animals. Inactivated vaccines have been
produced. The disease has not been reported outside
Mexico. However, another rubulavirus, Menangle virus,
was isolated from stillborn piglets during an outbreak of
reproductive disease at a large Australian commercial
piggery in 1997.
Infection caused by bovine parainfluenza virus 3
1746
Infection with bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3),
which
occurs
worldwide,  is  often subclinical.
Transmission,
which occurs by aerosols and direct contact, is facilitated
by overcrowding in poorly ventilated conditions. Although
uncomplicated infections are frequently subclinical, mild
isolated from animals during outbreaks of serious
respiratory disease such as enzootic calf pneumonia and
shipping fever, conditions in which other respiratory
viruses and bacteria are often involved. Various stress
conditions may contribute to the severity of the disease.
The virus infects ciliated epithelium of the respiratory
tract, alveolar epithelium and macrophages. Infection
causes destruction of ciliated epithelium resulting in
interference with the mucociliary clearance mechanism. In
addition, phagocytosis and intracellular destruction of
bacteria  by
  alveolar   macrophages   are   depressed,
predisposing to secondary bacterial infection in the lungs.
Most uncomplicated infections with BPIV-3 are mild and
are characterized by fever, nasal discharge and coughing
The majority of affected animals recover within a few
days. The virus can be isolated in suitable bovine cell lines
from nasal swabs or lung tissue. Samples should be taken
from several animals in the early stages of the disease and
transferred immediately to the laboratory in viral transport
medium. Direct immunofluorescence for detecting viral
antigen can be carried out on samples of nasal mucus or on
cryostat sections of lung. Haemagglutination-inhibition
tests,  virus  neutralization,  ELISA  and
 indirect
immunofluorescence are commonly used to demonstrate a
1747
four-fold rise in antibody titre between acute and
convalescent sera.
Both inactivated and modified live BPIV-3 vaccines are
available, often combined with other respiratory viruses.
Modified live vaccines are designed either for intranasal
administration or for intramuscular injection.Immunity
tends to be short-lived and reinfection may occur after
some months.
Infection caused by bovine respiratory syncytial virus
Pulmonary disease, caused by bovine respiratory syncytial
virus (BRSV), is recorded in beef and dairy calves
worldwide. Infection has been recorded in sheep and goats
with isolates designated as ovine respiratory syncytial
virus and caprine respiratory syncytial virus, respectively.
However, these isolates may represent strains of a
ruminant respiratory syncytial virus rather than separate
species. The virus is so named because of the characteristic
syncytia which it induces in infected cells in vivo and in
vitro.
Epidemiology
Infection in cattle is common. Moderate to severe
respiratory signs often develop in infected calves. Infection
in adult animals is usually mild or subclinical but severe
disease may occasionally occur (Ellis et al., 1996;
Elvander, 1996). Persistent infection in individual animals
is considered to be responsible for the maintenance of
infection in herds. Transmission occurs through aerosols or
through direct contact with infected animals. Most clinical
1748
cases are recorded during autumn and winter months
Transportation,  overcrowding
conditions can precipitate outbreaks of the disease.
Concurrent infection with bovine viral diarrhoea virus
results in more severe clinical signs than those encountered
in infection with each individual virus (Pollreiz et al.,
1997).
Pathogenesis
The virus replicates primarily in the ciliated epithelium of
the respiratory system.
 Destruction  of bronchiolar
epithelium
 results
11
necrotizing
 bronchiolitis.
Multinucleate cells are occasionally formed by fusion of
induction of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines
and it has been suggested that much of the pathological
changes are due to the host's response (Valarcher and
Taylor, 2007). Bovine respiratory syncytial virus is
considered to be immunosuppressive. This effect, along
with the accumulation of cellular debris and exudate in
pulmonary airways, facilitates bacterial proliferation.
Clinical signs
Affected animals are typically between 3 and 9 months
old. The incubation period is 2 to 5 days. Clinical signs,
which range from mild to severe, include fever, nasal and
lacrimal discharge, coughing and polypnoea. As the
disease progresses, open-mouth and abdominal breathing
may be present. The course of the disease is usually up to 2
weeks. A biphasic patterm is commonly observed in
outbreaks among beef calves. Mild respiratory disease is
1749
followed by apparent recovery and, within a few days,
dyspnoea and pulmonary emphysema develop. Mortality
in these outbreaks may reach 20%.
Diagnosis
Clinical signs and pathological findings may permit a
presumptive diagnosis. Laboratory confirmation  is
necessary for definitive diagnosis
·Suitable specimens for laboratory examination include nasal
swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue and paired
serum samples. Specimens should be collected from several
 animals in the affected group.
· As the virus is thermolabile, specimens must be transferred
 promptly to the laboratory in a suitable transport medium.
· Virus isolation is not attempted routinely as it is difficult and
requires several blind passages in cell culture.
· Commercial ELISA kits are available for the detection of
viral antigen. Immunofluorescence is a rapid and useful
technique. Viral antigen can be detected more readily in
specimens from the lower respiratory tract than in nasal
swabs.
· Polymerase chain reaction procedures have been described
for the detection of specific viral nucleic acid (Larsen et af.,
1999; Valarcher et al., 1999; Willoughby et al., 2008).
·Suitable serological tests for demonstrating a rising antibody
titre include virus neutralization and ELISA. Serum samples
should be taken early in the course of the disease as antibody
levels tend to rise rapidly
Control
Suitable control measures include reducing stress factors.
maintaining good hygiene in calf pens, rearing calves away
from older age groups and implementing a closed herd
1750
policy. Prior vaccination with formalin-inactivated virus
may exacerbate BRsV disease (Antonis et al., 2003).
Modified live vaccines may be administered parenterally
or intranasally. Although vaccination tends to reduce the
likelihood of clinical disease in exposed animals, the
duration of protection is short, and frequent boosters may
be required. Vaccines developed for the control of BRSV
infection  include  an  intranasal recombinant  herpes-1
vaccine expressing the attachment (G) glycoprotein
(Taylor et al., 1998), a vaccinia recombinant virus
(Antonis et al., 2003), a DNA vaccine encoding the fusion
gene (Taylor et al., 2005) and a subunit fusion
glycoprotein   vaccine    expressed    in   recombinant
baculovirus-infected insect cells (Sharma et al., 1996).

Rhabdoviridae
Members of the family Rhabdoviridae (Greek rhabdos,
rod) have characteristic rod shapes (Fig. 73.l). This
family, along
withthefamilies
Paramyxoviridae,
Bornaviridae and Filoviridae, belongs to the order
Mononegavirales (Fig. 73.2). Viruses in this order possess
a linear, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA genome of
negative polarity encased in a ribonucleo-protein complex
Rhabdoviruses
of
 vertebrates   are  bullet-shaped
cone-shaped while those infecting plants are generally
bacilliform.
This
large
family
contains viruses
of
vertebrates, 
invertebrates
and
plants.  The family
Rhabdoviridae
comprises
S1X
genera: Vesiculovirus,
Lyssavirus,
Ephemerovirus,
Cytorhabdo-virus,
Novir
habdovirus and Nucleorhabdovirus. Moreover, a large
number of rhabdoviruses have yet to be assigned to a
genus.Vesiculovirus,Lyssavirus and Ephemerovirus
genera contain viruses that infect vertebrates. Infectious
haematopoietic necrosis virus and related rhabdoviruses of
fish are included in the genus Novirhabdovirus.
Rhabdoviruses usually contain five major proteins: a large
RNA-dependent
t RNA
 polymerase
(L),a surface
glycoprotein (G), a nucleoprotein (N), a protein component
of the viral polymerase (P) and a matrix protein (M). The
G protein forms the surface peplomers which interact with
host cell receptors, facilitating endocytosis of the virion. In
addition,  the  G
protein inducesvirus-neutralizing
antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. Replication occurs
1758
in
the
cytoplasm
(with
the
exception
of
nucleorhabdoviruses). Newly synthesized nucleocapsids
acquire envelopes from the plasma membrane as virions
bud from the cell. Virions (100 to 430nm × 45 to 100 nm)
are stable in the pH range 5 to 10. They are rapidly
inactivated by heating at 56°C, by treatment with lipid
solvents and by exposure to UV light.

Rhabdoviridae is rabies virus, a Lyssavirus (Greek yssa
rage or fury). A number of distinct Lyssavirus genotypes
produce clinical signs indistinguishable from rabies (Table
73.1). Four new lyssaviruses have been isolated from bat
1760
species: Aravan virus, Khujand virus, Irkut virus and West
Caucasian bat virus. More than 25 viruses isolated from
animals have been classified in the genus Vesiculovirus
The most important vesiculoviruses which infect domestic
animals are the vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus and the
vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (Table 73.2). Bovine
ephemeral fever virus, of significance in some countries, is
the type species of the genus Ephemerovirus. Some fish
diseases, such as infectious haematopoietic necrosis, viral
haemorrhagic septicaemia and spring viraemia of carp are
also caused by rhabdoviruses.
Rabies
This viral infection, which affects the central nervous
system of most mammals including humans, is invariably
fatal. However, mammalian species vary widely in their
susceptibility. Most clinical cases are due to infection with
rabies virus (genotype 1). A number of other neurotropic
lyssaviruses, closely related to the rabies virus, produce
clinical signs indistinguishable from rabies (Table 73.1).
Genetic sequencing and antigenic studies have been used
serotypes (Smith, 1996; Gould et al., 1998). Each
genotype is assigned separate species status. Classical
continental land masses with the exception of Australia
and Antarctica. Many island countries are also free of the
disease.
Epidemiology
1761
Several species-adapted strains of rabies virus have been
described. Strains affecting a particular species are
transmitted more readily to members of that species than to
other animal species. In a given geographical region,
rabies is usually maintained and transmitted by particular
mammalian reservoir
r hosts. Twoepidemiologically
important infectious cycles are recognized, urban rabies in
dogs and sylvatic rabies in wildlife. More than 95% of
human cases are the result of bites from rabid dogs.
Racoons, skunks, foxes and bats are important reservoirs
of rabies virus in North America (Krebs et al., 1998). In
continental Europe, the principal reservoir is the red fox.
The vampire bat is an important reservoir of the virus in
Central and South America and in the Caribbean islands.
In developed countries, the control of stray dogs and the
use ofvaccination programmes
have reduced  the
importance of urban rabies and have focused attention on
wildlife reservoirs.
Species  susceptibility  to  rabies  virus  is important
epidemiologically. Domestic animals and humans are
considered to be moderately susceptible to the virus,
whereas foxes, wolves, coyotes and jackals are considered
tobe highly
susceptible.Althoughvirus maybe
transmitted through scratching and licking, transmission
usually occurs through bites. Infected animals may excrete
         
clinical signs.
Pathogenesis
Following introduction into the tissues, virus enters
peripheral nerve endings. There may be limited replication
1762
locally in myocytes or other tissue cells. The virus is
transported to the central nervous system by retrograde
axoplasmic flow and becomes widely disseminated in
nervous tissue by intra-axonal spread. Clinical signs
develop  following neuronal  damage caused  by  viral
replication. Virus spreads centrifu-gally within nerve cell
processes and is released at axon terminals where it infects
many non-nervous tissues including the salivary glands.
The presence of virus in saliva, especially in carnivores, is
an important factor in rabies transmission.
Although rabies viral antigens are highly immuno-genic,
immune  detection  is  delayed because intracellular
transport prevents contact with the cells of the immune
system in the early stages of infection.

Clinical signs
The incubation period, which is highly variable and can be
of many months’ duration, is influenced by various factors
including host species, virus strain, the quantity of virus in
the inoculum and the site of introduction of the virus.
Large amounts of virus introduced into deep bite wounds
in the head region are usually associated with short
incubation
periods. The clinical course in domestic
carnivores, which usually lasts for days, may encompass
prodromal, furious (excitative) and dumb (paralytic)
phases. In certain rabid animals, some of these phases may
not be observed. In the prodromal phase, affected animals
are often confused and disorientated; wild animals may
lose their natural fear of humans. The furious phase is
characterizedbyanincrease
in
0aggressivenessand
hyperexcitability, and there is a tendency to bite at
1764
inanimate objects and at other animals. Affected animals
may roam over long distances. The furious form is
observed more often in cats than in dogs. Foxes rarely
exhibit this form of the disease. In dumb rabies, muscle
weakness, difficulty in swallowing, profuse salivation and
dropping of the jaw are the usual features. These cli nical
signs may be mistaken for those caused by a foreign body
in the mouth or throat. The term hydrophobia, a synonym
for rabies in humans, relates to the ina bility to swallow
water because of pharyngeal paralysis
Diagnosis
Ante mortem diagnostic tests for rabies are not generally
used except in humans where saliva is examined by PCR
In endemic areas, suspect domestic carnivores which have
bitten humans should be isolated and observed for up to 7
days. The brains of animals that develop clinical signs
should be examined for the presence of virus. Rabies virus
is particularly abundant in Ammon's Horn of the
hippocampus, cerebrum, cerebellum and medulla. Rapid
laboratory confirmation is essential for the implementation
of appropriate treatment of human patients.
· The preferred method of diagnosis is the direct fluorescent
antibody test (FAT) on acetone-fixed brain tissue smears.
The FAT provides a rapid and specific diagnosis but may
yield false-negative results with autolysed brain specimens.
The conjugated antisera used for diagnosis are usually most
sensitive for detecting rabies virus (serotype 1), but will
detect other serotypes if a potent conjugate directed against
conserved antigenic sites on the nucleocapsid proteins is
used.
1765
· Non-suppurative encephalitis characterized by perivascular
lymphoid cuffing and intracytoplasmic inclusions (Negri
bodies) may be demonstrable histologically.
· Rabies virus can be cultured in neuroblastoma cells or in
baby hamster kidney cells. Culture of the virus is of value
when results of the FAT are uncertain. Rabies virus, which is
non-cytopathic, can be detected in tissue culture using
conjugated antisera.
· Unweaned mice, inoculated intracerebrally with brain tissue
from suspect rabies cases, should be observed over several
days for the development of disease. The FAT is used to
confirm the presence of rabies virus in infected mice.
·Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
has been used to detect viral RNA in brain samples. This test
can distinguish rabies virus (genotype l) from rabies-related
lyssaviruses. The sensitivity of RT-PCR can be enhanced by
combining the technique with ELISA which aids detection
of amplified product (Whitby et al., 1997).
 Serological tests, although rarely used to confirm a diagnosis
due to late seroconversion, are commonly used for trade and
for  animal  movement.  Internationally recognized  virus
neutralization tests include the rapid fluorescent focus
inhibition test (RFFIT) and the fluorescent antibody virus
neutralization test (FAVN). Commercially available indirect
ELISAs, using rabies glycoprotein as antigen, are useful
screening tests to determine if vaccinated cats and dogs have
seroconverted.

rabies
 can be effectively
controlled by vaccination and restriction of dog and cat
movement and by the elimination of stray animals. Control
of sylvatic rabies requires special measures. Regional
depopulation of reservoir species, which has rarely been
successful, is ecologically unacceptable. Vaccination of
red foxes with live oral vaccines, delivered in baits, has
eliminated sylvatic rabies from several regions of western
Europe. A number of modified live rabies virus vaccines
have been used including SAD B19, SAG-1 and SAG-2.
However, as a result of concerns about the safety of live
vaccines, a vaccinia-rabies virus glycoprotein (VRG)
recombinant vaccine was developed and has proved
effective for vaccinating foxes (Pastoret and Brochier,
1999), coyotes (Fearmeyhough et al., 1998) and racoons
(Hanlon et al., 1998). The rapid increase in racoon rabies
in the USA has proved difficult to control through
vaccination (Smith, 1996), and several challenges remain
for successful eradication in North America including
1768
development of practical vaccination methods for bats
(Rupprecht et al., 2004).
Commercial vaccines available for the immunization of
domestic  carnivores  by  parenteral  inoculation  contain
inactivated virus (genotype l) and are potent and safe.
These inactivated rabies vaccines are considered to be
effective against strains of genotype 1 virus. However,
their ability to induce a protective immune response
against other lyssavirus genotypes
isvariableand
cross-protection against individual lyssavi-ruses such as
Mokola virus may not develop. A commercial recombinant
canarypox virus vaccine is available for cats. Promising
developments include oral vaccination using either a
recombinant  canine type-2 adenovirus expressing  the
rabies virus glycoprotein (Tordo et al., 2008) or a double
glycoprotein rabies virus (RV) variant as a live-attenuated
vaccine (Faber et al., 2009).
Vesicular stomatitis
This febrile disease affects mainly horses, cattle and pigs
Other susceptible species include camelids, several
wildlife species and humans. Vesicular stomatitis is
clinically similar  to  foot-and-mouth disease and is a
disease listed by the Office International des Epizooties. A
number of closely related, antigenically distinct members
of the genus Vesiculovirus, of which the type species is
vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus, can cause the disease.
Most outbreaks are associated with vesicular stomatitis
Indiana virus or with vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus.
which is more virulent.  Cocal virus and vesicular
stomatitis Alagoas virus, also referred to as subtypes 2 and
1769
3 of vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus respectively, have
been
isolated from outbreaks of disease in horses and cattle in
South America (Table 73.2)
Epidemiology
Infection is endemic in Central America and in regions of
South America and the USA. Outbreaks of the disease
occur every 2 to 3 years in tropical and subtropical regions.
with clinical cases most common at the end of the rainy
season and early in the dry season. Rapid spread from
endemic areas to other regions may occur during some
summer seasons. Disease outbreaks in temperate regions.
which occur every 5 to 10 years, usually cease abruptly
with the onset of winter.
Although the mode of transmissionis incompletely
understood, direct contact and insect vectors have been
implicated. Virus is shed in saliva and can contaminate
water and feed troughs. The involvement of insect vectors
is inferred from the seasonal occurrence of cases and from
the pattern of spread with clustering of cases along river
valleys and in irrigated areas. Virus has been isolated from
many insect species including blackflies, mosquitoes,
sandflies and house-flies. Viral replication in blackflies has
been demonstrated experimentally. It is unclear how biting
insects acquire the virus from domestic animals as a
Pathogenesis
1770
Virus probably enters the body through abrasions on the
skin or mucous membranes or following an insect bite.
Vesicles, which develop at the site of infection, may
coalesce. Spread may occur locally by extension from
primary lesions. Although secondary lesions at distant sites
may develop, it is unclear how transfer of the virus occurs
and if these lesions result from viraemia or following
environmental contamination (Clarke et al., 1996).
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 5 days. Subclinical infection
is common: around 10 to 15% of animals in infected herds
show clinical signs. Affected animals, which are usually
more than l year old, become febrile. Vesicles develop on
the tongue and on oral mucous membranes, often
accompanied by profuse salivation. Secondary lesions may
occur on the coronary band and teats. Lameness is often a
prominent feature of the disease in pigs. Mastitis may
develop in cows with severe teat lesions. In the absence of
secondary infection, lesions generally heal within 2 weeks
The economic impact of the disease relates to production
losses, culling and other disease control measures (Hayek
et al., 1998). Following infection, animals develop high
levels of neutralizing antibodies but the duration of
protection is variable. Cross-protection between vesicular
stomatitis Indiana virus and vesicular stomatitis New
Jersey virus is limited.
Diagnosis
1771
Because of similarities between vesicular stomatitis,
foot-and-mouth disease and swine vesicular disease,
prompt laboratory confirmation is required. If horses
present with vesicular lesions, infection with vesicular
stomatitis virus should be considered.
·Suitable specimens for isolation of virus or for the detection
of viral antigen include epithelium from lesions and
vesicular fluid.
·Viral antigen can be detected by CFT or ELISA.
·Virus may be isolated in suitable cell lines, in embryonated
eggs or in suckling mice by intracerebral inoculation. The
virus is cytopathic. The fluorescent antibody test, ELISA,
CFT or the virus neutralization test are suitable procedures
for identification of isolates.
· Electron microscopy can be used to identify virus in
specimens or tissue culture.
stomatitis have been published (Rasmussen et al., 2005).
·Antibody levels in recovered animals may be assayed by
liquid-phase blocking ELISA, CFT, the virus neutralization
test, competitive ELISA or IgM-specific capture ELISA.
Because levels of complement-fixing and IgM antibodies
persist for only short periods, assays based on procedures
involving these antibodies can be used to confirm recent
infections in endemic areas.
Treatment and control
 Specific treatment is not available. Measures aimed at
minimizing secondary infections may be beneficial.
Suspected cases should be notified to the relevant
authorities. Movement restrictions and a 30-day quarantine
period following the last clinical case are recommended for
infected  premises. International  trade  restrictions  are
generally instituted following an outbreak.
1772
· Insect-proofing of buildings and avoidance of habitats
associated with insect vectors reduce the likelihood of
infection.
·Although both inactivated and attenuated vaccines have been
used, they are not commercially available.
·Vesicular stomatitis is a zoonotic disease with clinical signs
that resemble influenza.
Bovine ephemeral fever
This arthropod-borne viral disease of cattle and water
buffalo occurs in tropical and subtropical regions of
Africa, Asia and Australia. The virus causes subclinical
infection in many other ruminant species including Cape
buffalo, wildebeest, waterbuck and deer.
Epidemiology
Epidemiological
 evidence　 suggests  that    insects,
particularly   mosquitoes  and   possibly  certain  midge
species, are involved in transmission of the virus. In
tropical areas where bovine ephemeral fever is endemic,
subclinical infections are common. Outbreaks often follow
periods of rainfall. In more temperate regions, epidemics
occur during summer months and tend to decline with the
onset of winter. Transmission does not occur by direct
contact or by fomites. Persistence of virus in animals
following recovery from acute illness has not been
documented. It is probable that virus persistence occurs in
arthropod vectors.
Pathogenesis
1773
Blood-sucking insects acquire the virus when feeding on
animals during the brief viraemic stage of the disease. The
virus, which multiplies in the insect vector, is shed in its
saliva and is transmitted to a new host during feeding. The
virus primarily affects the endothelium of small blood
vessels and gives rise to a major systemic inflammatory
response. Many of the pathological changes observed in
infected animals are attributed to host response rather than
to direct viral damage.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is typically 3 to 5 days. The severity
of the clinical signs is influenced by the immune status of
infected animals and the virulence of the virus strain. The
  a      
high-yielding dairy cows. A biphasic high fever is
commonly observed. Affected animals become depressed,
anorexic, lame and constipated. Milk production drops
dramatically. Muscle stiffness and ruminal stasis may
develop. Pregnant animals may abort. Recumbency may be
accompanied by salivation and ocular and nasal discharge.
Muscular   fibrillation   and
paresis frequently occur,
reflecting the accompanying hypocalcaemia. The disease is
of short duration and affected animals usually recover after
a few days. Most recovered animals develop a solid
immunity.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of bovine ephemeral fever is usually based on
clinical signs. Virus neutralization tests or ELISA should
be carried out on paired serum samples to detect a rise in
1774
virus-specific antibody. Other serological tests such as
immunofluorescence are less useful as interpretation is
complicated   by  cross-reacting  antibodies  induced  by
infections with related non-pathogenic ephemeroviruses
such as Kimberley virus. Neutrophilia, increased plasma
fibrinogen and decreased plasma calcium levels are
commonly present. Isolation of bovine ephemeral fever
detection of viral RNA has been described (Stram et al.,
2005).
Treatment
Affected animals should be rested. Anti-inflammatory
drugs such as phenylbutazone, flunixin meglumine and
ketoprofen have proved useful for treatment (Fenwick and
Daniel, 1996). Intravenous or subcutaneous administration
of calcium borogluconate is recommended. Oral drenching
should be avoided during the acute phase of the illness
because swallowing may be impaired.
Control
s       
Control is based on the use of vaccines, both inactivated
and attenuated. Trials have been carried out using a
subunit vaccine based on the envelope glycoprotein (Uren
et al., 1994). A recombinant virus-vectored glycoprotein
vaccine has been developed.

Bornaviridae
The family Bornaviridae, which belongs to the order
Mononegavirales, contains a single genus, Bornavirus.
The sole member of the genus is Borma disease virus
(BDV). This enveloped virus, which has only recently
been demonstrated by electron microscopy, is spherical
with a diameter of about 90 nm (Fig. 74.1). The envelope
 'p n  o  o '   snns
genome consists of a single molecule of negative-sense,
single-stranded RNA. In contrast to other non-segmented
negative-sense RNA animal viruses, replication occurs in
the nucleus of host cells with budding at the cell surface.
The virus is highly neurotropic and highly cell-associated,
spreading by cell-to-cell contact in a non-cytolytic manner.
This labile virus is sensitive to heat, lipid solvents and low
pH values.
Clinical infections
Borma disease virus is associated with a severe T
cellmediated meningoencephalitis in horses and sheep in
central Europe. For many years efforts have been made to
confirm a link between the virus and staggering disease in
cats. Recently a number of reports have suggested that
proventricular dilatation disease, a fatal disorder of parrots,
is caused by an avian bornavirus (Honkavuori et al., 2008;
Kistler et al., 2008).
Borma disease
1779
This fatal neurological disease of horses is named after
Borna, the town in Saxony where in 1885 many horses
died in an epidemic of the disease. The disease occurs
sporadically in Germany, Switzerland and other parts of
Seroepidemiological studies, however, indicate a wide
geographical distribution. Antibodies reacting with BDV

Epidemiology
Neurological disease attributed to BDV has been described
in horses, sheep and cats. Serological evidence of infection
has been recorded in several other species including cattle,
rabbits, parrots and ostriches. The virus, which is thought
to be present in nasal, salivary and conjunctival secretions.

through inhalation. Most cases of Borna disease occur in
spring and early summer; prevalence varies from year to
1780
year. It has been suggested that rodents and wild birds may
act as reservoir hosts (Berg et al., 2001; Hilbe et al., 2006).
Persistent infections can be established experimentally in
rats.
Figure 74.1 Bornavirus particles as they appear in an
electron  micrograph   and  diagrammatic representation
(inset).
Pathogenesis and pathology
Following oronasal infection, the virus gains entry to the
CNS by intra-axonal spread either through the olfactory
nerve or through nerves supplying the oropharyngeal and
intestinal regions. Spread within the CNS and into the
peripheral nerves also occurs within axons. Viral antigens
1781
expressed on the surface of infected neurons induce a
cell-mediated  response  involving cytotoxic  CD8  and
resulting
gin destruction of the infectedcells. A

perivascular cuffing is largely confined to grey matter.
Neuronal  degeneration
is prominent and intranuclear
inclusions (Joest-Degen
bodies)
may  be present,
infected  animals,  which  are  relatively low  and
non-protective, are not linked to the pathogenesis of the
disease. Despite the persistence of infection, clinical signs
do not develop in immunodeficient animals.
Clinical signs
Borna disease has been described mainly in young horses.
The incubation period, which is highly variable, ranges
from weeks to severalmonths.Factors which may
influence the severity of clinical signs include the age and
immunological status of the infected animal and the strain
of infecting virus. On farms where infection in horses is
present, clinical disease is usually confined to individual
animals. Clinical signs include fever, somnolence and
evidence of neurological disturbance. Ataxia, pharyngeal
paralysis and hyperaesthesia may be present. The course of
the disease is up to 3 weeks and mortality rates may
approach 1oo%. Surviving horses have permanent CNS
damage and may exhibit recurrent episodes of neurological
disturbance. ‘Staggering disease' in cats has been
associated with BDV infection (Lundgren et al., 1995). In
defined geographical regions, sheep flocks with large
numbers of seropositive animals have been reported
1782
Diagnosis
Borna disease may vaguely resemble other neurological
conditions in the horse. However, the distribution of
         s
encephalomyelitides and, if eosinophilic  intranuclear
inclusions (Joest-Degen bodies) are present, they may be
confirmatory. Viral antigen can be demonstrated in the
brain by immunohistochemical methods. Demonstration of
  i s   s n s
immunofluorescence, immunoblotting or ELISA may aid
diagnosis.  Reverse transcriptase-PCR and real-time
RT-PCR for the demonstration of BDV-RNA are valuable
diagnostic tools (Legay et al., 200o; Wensman et al.,
2007).
Control
Although BDV does not appear to be readily transmitted
by infected horses, seropositive animals should be isolated.
Standard hygienic measures should be applied to suspect
animals. The disease is notifiable in Germany.

Bunyaviridae
The name of this family is derived from Bunyamwera, the
place in Uganda where the type species Bunyamwera virus
was first isolated. The family Bunyaviridae contains more
than 300 viruses. Virions (80 to 120 nm in diameter) are
spherical and enveloped. Glycoprotein peplomers project
from the surface of the envelope which encloses three
circular, helical, nucleocapsid segments (Fig. 75.1). The
viruses are sensitive to heat, acid pH levels, lipid solvents,
detergents and disinfectants. The genera in the family are
Orthobunyavirus,Phlebovirus,Nairovirus,Hantavirus and
Tospovirus. Based on antigenic relatedness, viruses within
each genus are placed in serogroups. The genome consists
of three single-stranded, negative or ambisense RNA
segments designated small (S), medium (M) and large (L)
Genetic reassortment occurs between closely related
viruses. There are four structural proteins: a nucleocapsid
(N) protein, a large (L) transcriptase protein and two
 n   ) sd
neutralizing antigenic determinants are present on one or
both of the envelope glycoproteins. Non-structural (NS)
proteins may be expressed by the S segment (designated
NSs) and by the M segment (designated NSm). Replication
takes place in the cytoplasm of host cells. In the final
stages of assembly, virions acquire envelopes by budding
into the Golgi network. They are then transported through
the cytoplasm in secretory vesicles and released by
exocytosis at the cell surface.
1786
Viruses in the genera Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus,
Nairovirus and Hantavirus infect vertebrates; those in the
genus Tospovirus infect plants.
Key points

viruses
·Replicate in the cytoplasm
·  Labile in the environment
· More than 300 viruses in the family, the majority
are arthropod-borne
· The family is composed of five genera:
- Orthobunyavirus contains viruses which cause
con genital defects in cattle and sheep
- Phlebovirus contains the virus which causes
Rift Valley fever
- Nairovirus contains the virus which causes
Nairobi sheep disease
- Hantavirus contains many viruses which cause
haemorrhagic fever in humans; rodents act as
reservoirs
- Tospovirus contains viruses of plants
Clinical infections
With the exception of viruses in the genus Hantavirus,
bunyaviruses are arthropod-borne. In nature, these
1787
arboviruses are maintained in complex transmission cycles
involving replication in both arthropod  vectors and
vertebrate hosts. Infection of mammalian cells often results
in cytolysis while infection of invertebrate cells is
non-cytolytic and persistent. Mosquitoes are the most
important vectors. Ticks, sandflies and midges may act as
vectors for some bunyaviruses.

temporary pools. Eggs of these species must remain dry
for a period before they hatch following re-immersion in
water. During epidemics, RVFV replicates in both wild
and domestic ruminants and can be transmitted by many
species of mosquitoes. Humans are frequently infected
during
these epidemics. Infected
1 ruminants  develop
1790
marked viraemia for up to 5 days after infection. During
this period, blood and tissues of affected animals are
infectious. Direct and indirect transmission can occur
through aerosols, contact with infected placentae or
aborted foetuses, fomites or mechanical transfer on the
mouthparts of flies. Abattoir workers and veterinarians are
particularly at risk of acquiring infection
Pathogenesis and pathology
Following infection and local replication, viraemia leads to
invasion of the liver and other major organs. Cell necrosis
is widespread, particularly in the liver. In pregnant animals
the virus crosses the placenta and the extensive cytolysis
results in foetal death.
Clinical signs
In mature sheep and goats, clinical signs include fever,
weakness, regurgitation of ingesta, foetid diarrhoea,
blood-tinged mucopurulent
nasal
discharge  and,
occasionally, icterus. Pregnant ewes may abort. Abortion
rates approaching 100% are not uncommon. Mortality
rates in adult sheep may be up to 60%. In lambs, the
incubation period is up to 36 hours. Affected animals are
pyrexic, listless and disinclined to move; they may show
signs of abdominal pain. Affected lambs rarely survive
          
mortality rate in lambs less than 1 week old approaches
90%. In cattle, mortality rates are usually below 10% and
abortion rates range from 15% to 40%.
1791
Human infections with RVFV are often inapparent or may
present as a moderate to severe influenza-like illness. The
haemorrhagic and encephalitic forms of the disease, which
occur in a small number of patients, can be fatal.
Diagnosis
· The histopathological lesions, particularly in the livers of
lambs, are considered pathognomonic. Demonstration of
viral  antigen in  fixed  tissues  by  immunohistochemical
methods is confirmatory.
· Virus can be isolated in suitable cell cultures, susceptible
laboratory animals or embryonated eggs. Specimens for
laboratory examinations include blood  from viraemic
animals, foetal organs and post-mortem specimens of liver,
spleen and brain. Because the virus can infect laboratory
personnel, suspect specimens should be handled only in
properly equipped laboratories.
· Rapid confirmatory tests include detection of viral antigen in
qss uoissuo siT q ns
immunofluorescence. Viral RNA can be readily detected in
serum and tissues, as well as in mosquitoes, using RT-PCR
(Sall et af., 200l; Bird et af., 2007).
·Demonstration of IgM antibodies by ELISA in a serum
sample or of seroconversion in paired serum samples by
virus neutralization, ELISA or haemagglutination inhibition
may be used for confirmation of the disease.
Control
Although vector control and environmental management
can assist in limiting the spread of Rift Valley fever, such
measures are often not feasible. Modified live vaccine
containing Smithburm's attenuated strain of RVFV is
widely used in endemic regions and during outbreaks. This
vaccine is unsafe in pregnant animals because it may cause
1792
congenital  defects  or  abortion.  A  mutagen-attenuated
vaccine, developed for use in humans, is effective but may
produce teratogenic effects depending on the stage of
pregnancy (Morrill et al., 1997; Hunter et al, 2002).
Another candidate vaccine is the attenuated clone 13, a
small plaque variant which has a large deletion in the small
RNA segment that codes for non-structural proteins
(Muller et al., 1995). Inactivated vaccines prepared from
highly immunogenic, virulent strains of RVFV are suitable
for use in pregnant animals and may be used in Rift Valley
fever-free countries bordering endemic regions
Nairobi sheep disease
This severe, tick-borne, viral infection of sheep and goats
occurs in central and eastern Africa. The causal agent,
Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV), is closely related to
Ganjam virus of sheep and goats in India. The virus is
currently classified as a strain of Dugbe
virus. Although humans are susceptible to NSDV,
infection appears to be uncommon.
Epidemiology
The brown ear tick (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus) is the
principal vector of the virus. Transovarial and transstadial
infection occurs with transmission by all stages of the tick.
In endemic areas, lambs and kids exposed to infection
while protected by maternally-derived antibody develop
active immunity.  Outbreaks of disease arise from
movement of susceptible animals into endemic areas or
disease-free areas.
1793
Pathogenesis
Following inoculation by an infected tick, regional lymph
nodes draining the site become enlarged and oedematous
The virus has a predilection for vascular endothelium and
replicates to high titres in liver, spleen, lungs and other
organs.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 6 days. There is marked
pyrexia and depression followed, within 48 hours, by
foetid dysentery. A mucopurulent nasal discharge and
conjunctivitis may be observed. Pregnant animals often
abort. The mortality rate ranges from 30% to 90%; death
may occur up to 11 days after the onset of clinical signs.
The disease is more severe in native breeds of sheep than
in Merinos. Clinical signs are milder in goats than in
sheep.
Diagnosis
A history of a high mortality rate in a flock recently
introduced into an endemic area may point to Nairobi
sheep disease. Specimens suitable for virus isolation in cell
culture include blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen
from febrile or dead animals. Direct immunofluorescence
is useful for identification of the virus in tissue culture
cells. Viral antigen can be detected directly in tissue
specimens by AGID. The indirect immunofluorescent test
is recommended for the detection of antibodies to NSDV.
Control
1794
Dipping is used to control the tick vector, and animals at
risk should be vaccinated. Modified live and inactivated
 e   s   sm
demand has not justified commercial production.
Bunyaviruses
and
ruminants
Orthobunyaviruses, which cause congenital defects, such
as arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly, and abortion in
cattle, sheep and goats include Akabane virus (Akabane
serogroup), Aino virus (Shuni virus serogroup), Peaton
virus (Shamonda virus serogroup), Douglas virus
(Sathuperi virus serogroup) and Tinaroo virus (Akabane
serogroup) has been linked to neonatal deaths and
malformed lambs in parts of the United States. The most
important and virulent of these viruses is Akabane virus.
Akabane disease
Serological studies indicate a widespread distribution of
this virus in tropical and subtropical regions in the Middle
East, Asia, Australia and Africa. Sporadic epidemics,
associated  with developmental defects, have been
described in Japan, Australia, Israel and parts of Africa.
The virus is transmitted by midges and mosquitoes.
Disease outbreaks appear to coincide with movements of
the vectors or following the introduction of susceptible
animals into endemic areas. Encephalomyelitis and
polymyositis develop in foetuses infected with Akabane
virus. The extent and degree of the pathological changes
that occur following infection can be related to the stage of
1795
gestation at which infection occurred. The most severe
damage, resulting in neurological defects, is evident in
calves born to cowsinfected at 12 to16 weeks of
gestation. Clinical signs are generally not observed in the
dam (Lee et al., 2002). Diagnosis is based on gross
of specific neutralizing antibody in the sera of aborted
calves or of newborn animals prior to suckling. Molecular
techniques for the detection and differentiation of Akabane
virus from other orthobunyaviruses have been described
(Akashi et al., 1999: Stram et al., 2004). Vector control
and vaccination are the methods used to prevent outbreaks
of the disease. An inactivated vaccine is available in Japan
and Australia. A live vaccine is commercially available in
Japan. In order to minimize the occurrence of congenital
defects in cattle and sheep, breeding stock should be
introduced into endemic areas in advance of the breeding
season.

Picornaviridae
Picornaviruses (Spanish pico, very small), which are
icosahedral and non-enveloped, contain a molecule of
single-stranded RNA. Virions are 30 nm in diameter (Fig
76.1). The capsid is composed of 60 identical subunits,
each containing four major proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3 and
VP4. The VP4 protein is located on the inner surface of the
capsid. Viral replication occurs in  the cytoplasm in
membrane-associated complexes and infection is usually
cytolytic. Picormaviruses are resistant to ether, chloroform
and non-ionic detergents. Individual genera differ in their
therma]   lability   and
pH　stability.Asubstantial
reorganization of the family has occurred in recent years.
The family originally comprised eight genera: Enterovirus,
Cardiovirus, Aphthovirus, Hepatovirus, Parechovirus,
Erbovirus, Kobuvirus and Teschovirus, Four new genera
have recently been added: Tremovirus, Sapelovirus,
Senecavirus and Avihepatovirus.The genus Rhinovirus
was removed following the re-classification of human
rhinovirus A and human rhinovirus B as enteroviruses.
Many of the porcine isolates, referred to as porcine
enteroviruses (PEV) 1-13, have been placed in the genus
Teschovirus. Several isolates previously referred to as
avian enteroviruses have been renamed and reassigned to
another genus (Sapelovirus and Avihepatovirus) or left
unassigned, while avian nephritis virus 1 and 2 have been
renamed chicken astrovirus and placed in the family
Astroviridae.

virus
(Bergmann et al., 1996; Mezencio et al., 1999) and swine
vesicular disease virus (Lin et al., 1998), can produce
persistent infections.  Antigenic variation, which may
contribute to the development of persistent infection

(Woodbury, 1995), has been attributed to a number of
molecular mechanisms including genetic recombination.

Bovine enteroviruses have been isolated from both normal
cattle and animals with enteric, respiratory and
duck hepatitis virus type 1) is an important cause of
hepatitis in ducklings; three genotypes of the virus have
been described.
Swine vesicular disease
This mild vesicular disease of pigs occurs sporadically in
parts of Europe and Asia; it is endemic in southern Italy.
Because   it is   indistinguishable   clinically  from
foot-and-mouth disease, accurate laboratory diagnosis of
swine vesicular disease (SVD) is essential and this is the
main reason it is still classified as a listed OIE disease.
Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), an enterovirus, is
closely related to human coxsackievirus B5, a subtype of
human enterovirus B. The pig is the natural host for the
virus. Laboratory workers handling contaminated material
can become infected.
1802
Epidemiology
In the presence of organic matter, SVDV is stable for long
periods in the environment and transmission can occur
directly or indirectly. Spread of disease from farm to farm
is dependent on the movement of infected pigs or
contaminated vehicles or fomites. Tissues of infected pigs.
which contain large quantities of virus, remain infective
despite the low pH values associated with rigor mortis.
The virus exhibits prolonged survival in refrigerated pork.
Pathogenesis
Following entry through damaged skin or by ingestion, the
virus replicates locally and subsequently spreads via the
lymphatics to the bloodstream. During viraemia of short
duration, many organs and tissues become infected. Virus
shedding, which is greatest during the first week following
infection, begins before clinical signs become evident. The
faeces and tissue material from infected pigs may contain
viable virus for months (Lin et al., 1998)
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 7 days. Infection is usually
characterized by a mild febrile illness. Strains of the virus
vary in virulence. Subclinical disease is common.
Transient fever is followed by the development of
vesicular lesions on the feet, particularly on the coronary
bands. Less commonly, vesicles appear on the lips, tongue
and snout. Lameness, dullness and inappetence may be
present. Lameness is exacerbated by penning on concrete
1803
floors. Affected animals remain in good condition and the
lesions heal within a few weeks.
Diagnosis
Laboratory tests are essential for differentiating SVD from
other important vesicular diseases of pigs.
·An ELISA is available for the rapid detection of viral
antigen in vesicular fluid or in epithelial tissues.

described (Lin et af., 1997 ; Nunez et af., 1998). In addition,

screening for antibodies to SVDV. Virus neutralization and
neutralization, although the standard test, requires tissue
culture procedures and takes longer to complete than ELISA.
A limitation of serological testing is that it may occasionally
yield false-positive results in some individual animals,
Control
Effective vaccines against SVD have been prepared.
Commercial  vaccines   are   not  available
because
vaccination is not considered a suitable control measure in
countries free of important vesicular diseases. In most
countries, SVD is a notifiable disease and eradication
policies are enforced with restrictions on the importation
of pigs and pork. Control measures, applied following an
outbreak of SVD, include thorough cleaning and
disinfection of premises, control of pig movement and
boiling of waste food fed to pigs.
Teschen/Talfan disease
This condition, formerly referred to as porcine enteroviral
encephalomyelitis, was first described in Teschen,
Czechoslovakia, in  1929 and subsequently caused
significant losses in several European countries. The
clinical  presentation varies in accordance  with  the
1805
virulence of the infecting strain of porcine enterovirus
(PEV). Severe clinical disease is now rare and is largely
confined to eastern Europe and Madagascar.
Epidemiology
Thirteenserotypes
S  of  porcine   enteroviruses 
were
recognized  formerly.  Comparative analysis  of  genome
sequences of porcine enteroviruses has resulted in PEV 1
to 7 and PEV 11 to 13 being assigned to a newly-created
genus, Teschovirus, which comprises a single
species and eleven serotypes, porcine teschovirus (PTV) 1
to ll.  Porcine teschovirus serotypes associated with
PTV-5. The most important neurotropic strains belong to
PTV serotype 1 (PEV1), which includes both the highly
virulent isolates associated with Teschen disease and the
less virulent but widely distributed strains that cause
endemic posterior paresis (Talfan disease). In common
with swine vesicular disease, transmission occurs by the
faecal-oral route either directly or indirectly. Clinical
disease is most severe in young pigs in herds which have
not been previously exposed to infection. In herds that are
endemically infected, sporadic clinical disease tends to
occur
aftermixing of
weaned
pigs when
maternally-derived immunity has declined.
Pathogenesis
Following ingestion, virus replicates in the tonsils,
intestines and associated lymph nodes. Viraemia and
invasion of the central nervous system may follow,
1806
particularly when virulent strains are involved. Faecal
excretion of virus may continue for several weeks.
Clinical signs
Fever, depression and listlessness may be followed about 1
week after infection by neurological signs. Weakness and
incoordination progress to paraplegia and paralysis. Pigs
with posterior paralysis may adopt a dog-sitting posture.
Severely affected animals exhibit nystagmus, opisthotonos,
convulsions and coma. Mortality rate in these animals is
high. Mildly affected pigs usually recover.
Diagnosis
 A mild  to severe non-suppurative encephalomyelitis  is
demonstrable histologically. The presence of viral antigen
 may be detectable by immunohisto-chemical staining.

specimens of brain and spinal cord. The virus produces a

viral RNA (Palmquist et af., 2002), while specific primer
sets have been designed to differentiate the different species
of porcine picornaviruses (Zell et af., 2000). A real-time
assay has also been described (Krumbholz et af., 2003).
·Virus neutralization and ELISA are the most frequently used
serological methods for demonstrating antibodies to PTV.
Because antibodies to PTV strains are common in pig
populations, it is necessary to demonstrate a fourfold rise in
titre between acute and convalescent sera for disease
confirmation.
Control
1807
Both inactivated and modified live vaccines are effective
and have been used for the control of Teschen disease, a
disease which is notifiable in many countries. Outbreaks
can be controlled by slaughter, strict sanitary measures and
ring vaccination.
Reproductive disorders caused by porcine picornaviruses
Porcine teschovirus serotypes PTV1, PTV3 and PTV6 as
well as porcine sapelovirus (porcine enterovirus A, PEV8)
are associated with the SMEDI syndrome (stillbirths,
mummification, embryonic death and infertility) in pigs.
Although  these viruses are widely distributed in
commercial pig herds, they are pathogenic only for
embryos and foetuses. Clinical disease follows infection of
naive, pregnant animals. Cross-protection between
serotypes does not occur. Transmission is by the
faecal-oral route. Infection of the alimentary tract is
followed by viraemia and transplacental spread to
developing foetuses. The clinical effects of infection
depend on the stage of gestation. Infection during early to
mid-gestationresults
in  embryonic  death
 and
mummification, whereas infection during the later stages
of pregnancy may result in stillbirths or the birth of live
piglets. A susceptible sow may, therefore, give birth to
mummified, stillborn and live piglets, reflecting the stage
of foetal development at the time of infection. The clinical
presentation is indistinguishable from porcine parvovirus
infection, a more common cause of the SMEDI syndrome.
Laboratory confirmation requires either isolation of the
virus
from lung tissues of stillborn piglets or
demonstration of antibody in the serum of stillborm or
newborn  piglets   prior   to  ingestion  of colostrum.
1808
Mummified foetuses carried to term usually do not contain
live virus but viral antigen may be detectable by
immunofluorescence.   Commercial  vaccines  are   not
available.  Gilts    should 
1be exposed to porcine
tescho-viruses by contact with older sows, faeces or
mummified foetuses prior to breeding
Avian encephalomyelitis
This viral disease of young birds has been recorded in
domestic fowl, pheasants, quail and turkeys. Avian
encephalomyelitis (AE) is of considerable economic
importance in chickens. Although avian encephalomyelitis
virus (AEV) was formerly considered to be an enterovirus
it has been shown to be most closely related to hepatitis A
virus and tentatively assigned to the genus HepatoviruS
(Todd et al., 1999). A new genus, Tremovirus, has been
created. Horizontal and vertical transmission occurs. The
virus produces enteric infection and is shed in the faeces.
A proportion of the eggs of infected hens are infected.
Chicks infected in ovo hatch normally but shed virus and
infect other chicks in the incubator shortly after hatching
Infection of the intestinal tract is followed by viraemia and
a competent immune response is required to prevent
infection of the central nervous system. Clinical signs,
which usually become evident within 2 weeks, include
ataxia and fine tremors of the head and neck. Progressive
paralysis leads to death due to inanition or following
trampling.   Non-suppurative   encephalomyelitis 
and
lymphocytic accumulations in viscera, particularly the
pancreas, are characteristic. Demonstration of viral antigen
in tissues by immunofluorescence or by virus isolation in
embryonated hens' eggs from brain or pancreas is
1809
confirmatory. Viral RNA in tissues can be detected using
RT-PCR (Xie et al., 2005). Serological testing of paired
sera may be of diagnostic value. Control is achieved by
vaccination of breeding  flocks with a modified live
vaccine to ensure the presence of maternally-derived
antibodies in chicks.
Foot-and-mouth disease
This highly contagious disease of even-toed ungulates is
characterized by fever and the formation of vesicles on
epithelial surfaces. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a
listed disease of major importance internationally  on
account of its rapid spread and the dramatic economic
       
foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) are grouped into
sevenmalor
r   serotypes  with differing  geographical
distributions (Table 76.1). Infection with one serotype does
  s     
number of subtypes is recognized within each serotype.
Nucleotide sequencing of the VPl (1D) gene, which
encodes for a capsid protein, is used for comparing an
isolate from an outbreak with other isolates of the same
serotype in order to determine possible sources of
infection. Study of VP1-based phylogenies has revealed
that different genotypes within the O and SAT types
evolve in discrete geographical regions and such variants
are known as topotypes. The dramatic spread of the
pan-Asian lineage (topotype) of type O virus in recent
years, which resulted in a very extensive and expensive
outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001, has been of
particular concern in European countries.

Epidemiology
Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and domesticated buffalo are
susceptible to FMD. Several wildlife species including
African buffalo, elephants, hedgehogs, deer and antelopes
are also susceptible. Large numbers of virus particles are
shed in the secretions and excretions of infected animals.
Virus shedding begins during the incubation period, about
24hours before the appearance of clinical signs.
Transmission can occur by direct contact, by aerosols, by
mechanical carriage by humans or vehicles, on fomites and
through animal products such as meat, offal, milk, semen
or embryos. Because of their large respiratory volume and
the low dose of virus required to establish infection, cattle
are highly susceptible and are often the first species in
which clinical  signs  are evident.  Infected groups of
animals, particularly pigs, shed large quantities of virus in
aerosols (Donaldson et al., 200l). Under favourable
conditions of low temperature, high humidity and
1811
moderate winds, virus in aerosols may spread up to 10 km
over land. Turbulence is generally less marked over water
than over land. In 1981, virus was carried a distance of
more than 20o km from France to the south coast of
England.
The virus, which is moderately resistant to environmental
factors, is sensitive to acid and alkaline conditions outside
the range pH of 6.0 to 9.o. Virus can remain infective on
soil for 3 davs in summer and for up to 28 davs in the
winter. Following death of the host, lactic acid production
in muscle inactivates the virus but it may survive in offal
and in bone marrow. Foot- and- mouth virus can persist in
the pharyngeal region of carrier animals which have
recovered from FMD. It can also persist in vaccinated
animals infected with a subtype different from the vaccinal
subtype. Infection may persist for up to 3 years in cattle,
for many months in sheep and for up to 5 years in the
African Cape buffalo. Transmission of infection from
persistently-infected African Cape buffalo to domestic
cattle has been clearly demonstrated, whereas there is only
circumstantial  evidence   to   indicate   the   occasional
transmission of infection from persistently-infected cattle.
It is unclear if virus can persist in pigs (Bergmann et al.,
1996; Mezencio et al., 1999; Zhang and Bashiruddin,
2009).
Pathogenesis
Although infection usually occurs through inhalation, the
most efficient method of infection, virus can also gain
entry to tissues through ingestion, insemination and
inoculation, and through contact with abraded skin. Pigs
1812
are more resistant than ruminants to the virus and infection
tends to occur through the feeding of contaminated,
untreated swill. Primary viral replication, after inhalation,
takes place in the mucosal and lymphatic tissues of the
pharynx. Viraemia follows primary multiplication with
further viral replication in lymph nodes, mammary glands
and other organs as well as the epithelial cells of the
mouth, muzzle, teats, interdigital skin and coronary band.
In these areas of stratified squamous epithelium, vesicle
formation results  from  swelling

ruptureof
keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum.
Clinical signs
The incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days, but is
generally shorter than a week. Infected cattle develop fever
and inappetence and show a drop in milk production.
Profuse salivation, with characteristic drooling and
smacking of lips, accompanies the formation of oral
vesicles which rupture, leaving raw, painful ulcers.
Ruptured vesicles in the interdigital cleft and on the
coronary band lead to lameness. Vesicles may also appear
on the skin of the teats and udders of lactating cows.
         
secondary bacterial infection which exacerbates and
prolongs the inflammatory process. Infected animals lose
condition. Mature animals seldom die. Calves may die
from acute myocarditis. Although the virus does not cross
the placenta, abortion probably relates to the pyrexial
response.
In pigs, foot lesions are severe and the hooves may slough
Marked lameness is the most prominent sign in this
1813
species. The disease in sheep, goats and wild ruminants is
generally mild, presenting as fever accompanied
[by
lameness which spreads rapidly through groups of animals
Human infection, usually mild, has been described on rare
occasions in laboratory personnel working with the virus
and in individuals handling infected animals.

resembles  other
vesicular diseases of domestic animals including vesicular

vesicular exanthema in pigs (Table 76.2). Consequently,
FMD
0requires laboratory
confirmation.Laboratory
procedures involving FMDV must be carried out in
1814
purpose-built laboratories suitable  for containment  of
Group 4 pathogens.
·A confirmatory diagnosis is based on the isolation of FMDV
from samples of tissue or vesicular fluid. Epithelium
collected from an unruptured or recently ruptured vesicle is
ideal for laboratory processing.
·Viral antigen demonstration may be carried out by ELISA or
CFT.
·In persistent or subclinical infections, samples of
 o    o
RT- PCR.
· Virus isolation is carried out in special cell lines such as
primary bovine thyroid or kidney cells.
 The preferred test for virus detection is the RT-PCR which is
sensitive and specific and has been adapted for the
amplification of genome fragments of FMDV (Reid et af.
2000). Real-time protocols are available and considered to
be as sensitive as virus isolation (Alexandersen et af., 2002)
with potential for use in the field (King et af., 2008).
Specific primers, which can distinguish the seven serotypes,
are available.
· Demonstration of specific antibody by virus neutralization or
ELISA can be used to confirm a diagnosis in unvaccinated
animals. In endemic areas, interpretation of antibody titres
may prove difficult. The use of assays (De Diego et al.,
1997;
Bergmann et al., 2000) such as ELISA or immunoblotting,
capable of detecting antibodies to non-structural proteins
(NSPs), has proved useful for differentiating animals
currently or previously infected from animals vaccinated
with purified or recombinant protein preparations, which do
not contain NSPs (Mackay et af., 1997 ; Sorensen et af.,
1998 ; Paton et af., 2006). These assays are probably most
appropriate for herd use rather than for individual animals
 ss  s a s 
infected produce little antibody to NSPs (Mackay, 1998).
1815
Control
In countries that are free from FMD, it is notifiable
Affected and in-contact animals are slaughtered. Following
an outbreak, movement restrictions are applied and
infected premises must be thoroughly cleaned and
disinfected. Mild acids such as citric acid and acetic acid
and alkalis such as sodium carbonate are effective
disinfectants. Reserves of inactivated virus are maintained
in several countries to provide an adequate supply of
vaccine at short notice in the event of a major outbreak of
the disease. Although ring vaccination around an affected
premises may help to limit the spread of the disease, 1t may
also allow the development of the carrier state in animals
subsequently exposed to the virus.
In countries where FMD is endemic, efforts are generally
directed at protecting high-yielding dairy cattle by a
combination  of  vaccination  and
1controlofanimal
movement. Vaccines for FMD incorporating adjuvant are
derived from tissue-culture-propagated virus which has
been chemically inactivated. They are usually multivalent,
containing three or more virus strains. Protection against
antigenically-similar strains of virus is satisfactory and
lasts for up to 6 months. Research is continuing into the
development of improved vaccines based principally on
peptide synthesis or recombinant DNA technology (Doel,
1996; Grubman, 2005)
Infections caused by equine rhinitis viruses
    ss   
rhinovirus 1 is closely related to foot-and-mouth disease
1816
virus. It has been renamed equine rhinitis A virus and has
been placed in the genus Aphthovirus. Equine rhinitis B
virus (equine rhinovirus 2, 3) comprises three serotypes
and has been placed in the genus Erbovirus. Infection with
equine rhinitis viruses appears to be widespread and most
horses are exposed early in life. Although equine rhinitis A
virus and equine rhinitis B virus have been associated with
acute respiratory disease (Carman et al., 1997; Klaey et al.,
1998; Dynon et al., 2007), they are generally considered to
be minor respiratory pathogens. They may contribute to
the development of disease following surgery or strenuous
exercise or when present in mixed infections with bacteria
or other viruses. Viraemia and prolonged shedding of virus
in urine occurs in infection with equine rhinitis A virus.
Infection with encephalomyocarditis virus
Rodents are considered to be the natural hosts of
encephalomyocarditis virus  (EMCV).  However,  this
cardiovirus has a wide host range including humans,
monkeys and pigs. Infection in pigs is usually sub-clinical
but sporadic deaths and minor outbreaks of disease have
been described. Rats and mice, the principal reservoirs,
excrete virus in faeces and urine. The virus is stable in the
environment.   Pigs  acquire   infection   by   ingesting
(Koenen et al., 1999). Following ingestion, viraemia
develops within a few days. Subsequently, high titres of
virus can be demonstrated in the myocardium, spleen and
mesenteric lymph  nodes.  Transplacental  infection may
occur. Virus isolates associated with myocardial disease
are apparently distinct from those responsible for
reproductive disease (Koenen et al., 1999).
1817
Outbreaks of disease are generally restricted to one
particular age group. The severity of the disease relates to
the strain of virus and the age of the infected pigs, with
severe disease usually confined to the first weeks of life.
Piglets may die suddenly as a result of heart failure.
Hydrothorax, hydropericardium and ascites may be
demonstrated at post-mortem examination.  Areas of
myocardial necrosis with associated lymphoid infiltration
may be demonstrable histologically. Changes in the CNS
are minimal. Reproductive failure in sows is characterized
by
ymummified foetuses and stillbirths. Laboratory
confirmation relies on virus isolation and identification.
The rapid detection of EMCV RNA in clinical specimens
by RT-PCR has been described (Vanderhallen and
Koenen, 1997).  Virus neutralization,  ELISA  and
haemagglutination tests can be used to detect specific
antibodies. Control of rodents is important in reducing the
likelihood of infection. An inactivated vaccine is available
commercially in the USA.

Caliciviridae
Caliciviruses
(Latin
calix，cup)
 have  cup-shaped
depressions
  on the surface
of  virions which are
demonstrable by electron microscopy. The virions, 27 to
40 nm in diameter, are icosahedral and non-enveloped
(Fig. 77.1). The genome consists of a single molecule of
linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA. Replication
takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and virions
are released by cell lysis. Many caliciviruses have not yet
been cultured. The virions are resistant to ether,
chloroform and mild detergents. They are relatively
resistant to heat but are sensitive to acid pH values.
Caliciviruses, which are closely related to picorna-viruses,
were  formerly grouped within  the  Picorna-viridae.
Currently, the family Caliciviridae is divided into four
genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus and two genera of human
caliciviruses referred to as Norovirus and Sapovirus. A
fifth genus, ‘Nebovirus', has been proposed with type
species Newbury-l virus (bovine enteric calicivirus)
isolated from the faeces of a calf. The genus Vesivirus
contains vesicular exanthema of swine virus, the type virus
of the family, San Miguel sea lion virus and feline
calicivirus. The Lagovirus genus contains two viruses of
lagomorphs, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus and
European brown hare syndrome virus. The human
caliciviruses, Norwalk virus and Sapporo virus, cause
gastroenteritis. Due to the lack of clarity of surface detail
and their fuzzy appearance when viewed by electron
1824
microscopy, noroviruses are also referred to as small,
round, structured viruses. Bovine (Newbury-2 virus) and
porcine noroviruses have been described (Scipioni et al.,
2008). Hepatitis E virus of humans, formerly classified in
the Caliciviridae, has been placed in a newly created
family, Hepeviridae.

(Table 77.1).
Infections with
caliciviruses, which are frequently persistent, may be
inapparent, mild or acute. Transmission occurs directly or
indirectly   without   vector   involvement.   However,
mechanical  transmission  of rabbit haemorrhagic  disease
virus by mosquitoes and fleas has been described.

Vesicular exanthema of swine
First reported in southerm Califormia in 1932, vesicular
exanthema of swine (VES), an acute, highly contagious
disease, became widespread throughout the USA during
1826
the 1950s. An eradication campaign included rigorous
implementation of laws relating to the cooking of waste
food. The last outbreak of VES was recorded in 1956 and
the country was declared free of the disease in 1959. A
reservoir of the virus exists in marine mammals. In 1972.
the San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV) was isolated from
Califormia sea lions, which had developed vesicles on their
flippers.  Premature  parturition  occurred  in  infected
animals. Subsequently, SMSV has been isolated from a
number of other marine mammals and from the opal eye
fish. Strains of SMSV produce VES when inoculated into
pigs and it is thought that the original outbreak of VES
arose through the feeding of uncooked swill containing
meat from infected marine mammals. These vesicular
viruses show antigenic heterogeneity. There are 13
serotypes of vesicular exanthema of swine virus and 17
serotypes of SMSV. San Miguel sea lion virus is currently
classified as a strain of vesicular exanthema of swine virus
The incubation period of VES is up to 72 hours and the
course of the disease is approximately 2 weeks. Vesicles
appear on the tongue, lips, snout, interdigital skin and
coronary bands. Affected pigs are febrile and acutely lame.
Although morbidity is high, mortality is low. The disease
is  clinicallyindistinguishable from  foot-and-mouth
disease, vesicular stomatitis and swine vesicular disease.
Because of its similarity to foot-and-mouth disease,
vesicular exanthema of swine is an important disease.
Weight loss in fattening pigs and mortality in neonatal pigs
are economically important consequences of the infection

Vesicular fluid and the overlying flap of epithelium are

virus isolation in pig kidney cell lines.
Feline calicivirus infection
Infections caused by feline calicivirus (FCV) account for
about 40% of upper respiratory tract inflammatory disease
in cats worldwide. All species of Felidae are considered to
 a q  s  g  ad 
domestic cats and to cheetahs in
1828
captivity. Most FCV isolates belong to a single genotype,
although a second genotype has been described in Japan
(Sato et al, 2002). There is a high degree of antigenic
heterogeneity among FCV isolates. Sequence analysis
studies have shown that individual isolates of FCV exist as
quasispecies, which evolve and exhibit antigenic drift.
Significant  alterations  in  the antigenic  profiles   of
sequential virus isolates from carrier cats are thought to be
influenced by immune selection and may play an
important part in viral persistence (Radford et al., 1998)
Epidemiology
Although cats of all ages are susceptible to infection with
FCV, acute disease occurs most commonly in kittens as
maternally-derived antibody wanes between 2 and3
months of age. Infected cats excrete large amounts of virus
1n
oronasal   secretions.  Many
y  cats  shed   virus  in
oropharyngeal secretions for at least 30 days after recovery
from acute infection or following subclinical infection
while protected by maternally-derived antibody or by
vaccination. A minority remain persistently infected and
shed virus continuously for months and, occasionally, for
         
these carrier animals and the prevalence of infection is
highest where large groups of cats live together. It is
thought that this persistence arises as a result of a
combination of both viral and host factors. Sequential
studies of isolates from endemically-infected colonies of
cats indicate that a number of mechanisms operate to
n      s   
population. Progressive  evolution  of   virus  within
persistently-infected
[ individuals
through
mutation
1829
accumulation
givesrisetochanges
inthe
immunodominant region of the capsid protein, allowing
the virus to escape the host immune response. In addition,
recombination between different viral strains has been
described (Coyne et al., 2006b). As a result, the majority
of cats within an infected colony undergo sequential
reinfection with viral variants of the same strain or with
distinct, co- circulating strains (Coyne et al., 2007).
Although  infection   usually   follows  contact    with
acutely-infected or carrier cats, indirect transmission can
also occur with virus capable of persisting in the
environment for up to 1 month on dry surfaces at room
temperature.
Pathogenesis
Virus replication occurs primarily in the oropharynx with
rapid spread throughout the upper respiratory tract and to
the conjunctivae. A transient viraemia occurs with spread
of virus to many other tissues. Infections range from
subclinical to severe, reflecting differences in strain
virulence. Virulent strains of FCV can cause interstitial
pneumonia in young kittens. The virus has been recovered
from the joints of lame cats. In recent years, virulent
systemic disease (VSD-FCV)has beendescribed,
associated with certain virulent strains of the virus and
characterized by vasculitis, multi-organ involvement and
high mortality (Hurley et al, 2004; Coyne et al., 2006a)
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 5 days. Clinical signs.
which are usually confined to the upper respiratory tract
1830
and the conjunctivae, are often less severe than those
caused by feline herpesvirus 1 infection. Fever, oculonasal
discharge and conjunctivitis are accompanied by the
development of characteristic vesicles on the tongue and
oral mucosa. These vesicles rupture leaving shallow ulcers.
        
Stiffness and shifting lameness, which usually resolve
within a few days, are sometimes seen during the acute
phase of FCV infection or following inoculation with FCV
vaccine. An association between infection with FCV and
chronic gingivitis and stomatitis has been suggested, when
infection with feline immunodeficiency virus is also
present.
In cats affected by VSD-FCV, the upper respiratory tract
disease is accompanied by pyrexia, cutaneous oedema.
ulcerative dermatitis and jaundice. Adult cats are often
more severely affected than kittens and vaccination does
not seem to be protective. Mortality rates may be as high
as 50%. Outbreaks of VSD-FCV are usually associated
with the introduction of cats from large rescue shelters into
another colony and tend to be of short duration
Diagnosis
·Upper respiratory tract signs along with ulcers on the oral
mucosa are suggestive of infectionwithFCV.
Differentiation from feline herpesvirus 1 infection requires
laboratory testing.
· Feline calicivirus can be isolated in feline cell lines from
oropharyngeal swabs or from lung tissue. The detection of
FCV may not be aetiologically significant due to the large
numbers of carrier and shedding animals in cat populations
1831
·Viral RNA can be detected in clinical specimens using
RT-PCR (Sykes et af.,1998) and real-time RT-PCR
(Wilhelm and Truyen, 2006) protocols. The design of the
primers used must take account of the variability of the viral
genome.
 On account of the high seroprevalence in cat populations,
demonstration of a rising antibody titre in paired serum
samples is required for laboratory confirmation of infection.
Control
Vaccination and management practices aimed at reducing
exposure to the virus are the main methods of control.
Inactivated  vaccines  for  parenteral  administration  and
modified live vaccines for either parenteral or intranasal
administration    are    available.   DNA    vaccines   and
virus-vectored vaccines have been developed but are not
yet commercially available. Although vaccination protects
effectively against acute upper respiratory tract disease, it
does not prevent subclinical infection or the development
of a carrier state. Vaccines are based on a limited number
of FCV isolates, which cross-react with a broad spectrum
of field isolates. An increasing number of recent field
isolates are not neutralized by vaccine-induced antisera in
vitro (Lauritzen et al., 1997) and this has led to the
incorporation of new vaccine strains (Addie et al., 2o08).
Live vaccines for administration by injection may cause
clinical signs if administered by other routes. Intranasal
vaccines are useful where a rapid onset of protection is
needed, such as when there is a high risk of a disease
outbreak, but they may give rise to mild clinical signs such
recommended for cats in high risk circumstances, while
triennial intervals may be sufficient for cats in low risk
1832
categories (European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases,
2007). Management practices aimed at reducing viral
spread and load in large catteries include vaccination, use
of quarantine facilities, grouping of new arrivals, good
hygiene practices, use of pens that prevent direct contact
and avoidance of overcrowding. Additional measures in
endemically-infected breeding colonies include reduction
in stocking density, early vaccination and early weaning of
kittens followed by rearing in isolation.
Rabbit haemorrhagic disease
This is a highly contagious, acute and often fatal disease of
European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Rabbits under 2
months of age are not susceptible. A single serotype of the
virus (RHDV) and two major subtypes are recognized:
RHDV and  the antigenic
variant RHDVa. Rabbit
haemorrhagic disease (RHD) was first reported in China
during 1984 and has since been encountered in many parts
of the world. This virus is considered to be a mutant form
of a non-pathogenic virus, sometimes referred to as rabbit
calicivirus, which has been endemic in commercial and
wild rabbits in Europe for many years (Capucci et al.,
1996). Phylogenetic analyses of RHDV isolates indicate
that virulent strains have emerged on more than one
occasion and that the outbreaks in China were caused by a
European virus following the importation of Angora
rabbits from Germany (Forrester et al., 2006). Rabbit
haemorrhagic disease virus has been used for biological
control of rabbits in Australia and New Zealand
Epidemiology
1833
Virus is shed in all excretions and secretions. Among
rabbits in close contact, transmission is mainly by the
faecal-oral route. Infection may also occur by inhalation or
through the  conjunctiva.  Mechanical  transmission  by a
variety of insects including mosquitoes and fleas has been
demonstrated. The virus survives in the environment and
indirect transmission through contaminated foodstuff or
fomites may occur. Spread of virus between units and
between countries may result from uncontrolled movement
of infected rabbits or from contact with infected rabbit
meat, insects or fomites. The virus was inadvertently
released from a research facility in Australia during 1995
and, subsequently, was illegally introduced into New
Zealand in 1997. In Europe, outbreaks of RHD have been
variable in severity and in Italy this has been attributed to
the presence of non-pathogenic rabbit calicivirus infection.
In certain populations of rabbits, RHDV appears to
circulate without evidence of disease (Forrester et al..
2007).  Epidemiological factors may be important in
determining disease outcome, with most transmission
occurring during and just after the breeding season (White
et al., 2004). It has been shown that infection of young
subsequent RHDV challenge when they reach maturity
(Ferreira et al., 2008).
Pathogenesis and pathology
Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage are considered
to be the major targets of the virus (Ramiro-Ibanez et al.,
1999). Juvenile rabbits up to 2 months of age are resistant
to the disease. The reason for this resistance is unclear but
it may have a physiological basis. Severe hepatic necrosis
1834
is the most obvious lesion in affected rabbits. In addition,
there may be evidence of disseminated intravascular
coagulation.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 3 days. The disease is
characterized by high morbidity and high mortality.
The course is short, with death occurring within 36 hours
of the onset of clinical signs. Acutely affected animals are
pyrexic and depressed and have an increased respiratory
rate. A serosanguineous nasal discharge, haematuria and
neurological signs including convulsions may be present.
Rabbits may be found dead or die in convulsions. A few
rabbits may present with mild, subacute signs during the
later stages of an epizootic. Some animals may survive for
a few weeks with jaundice, weight loss and lethargy.
Diagnosis
High mortality in rabbits along with characteristic gross
lesions including necrotic hepatitis and congestion of
spleen and lungs are suggestive of RHD. Culture of RHDV
has not been successful. High concentrations of virus are
present in affected livers. Confirmation is based on
detection of virus by electron microscopy or of viral
antigen
byELISA,
immunofluorescence
haemagglutination using human erythrocytes. Reverse
transcriptase PCR and real time RT-PCR have been
developed for the detection of RHDV nucleic acid (Moss
et al, 2002; Gall et al, 2007). Suitable serological tests for
the detection of specific antibodies to the virus include
haemagglutination-inhibition and ELISA
1835
Control
In countries where RHD is endemic, control is achieved by
vaccination. Inactivated and adjuvanted vaccines prepared
from clarified liver suspensions of experimentally infected
rabbits are usually administered at about 10 weeks of age.
Novel vaccines are being developed, based on recombinant
myxoma  virus expressing RHDV capsid protein or on
virus-like  particles from  capsid  protein  produced  in
baculovirus expression systems.

Astroviridae
The family Astroviridae (Greek aster, star) contains
viruses with a surface structure that imparts a star-like
appearance. Astroviruses, 28 to 30 nm in diameter, are
non-enveloped and have icosahedral symmetry (Fig. 78.1).
The genome consists of  a single molecule
of
positive-sense, linear, single-stranded RNA. These viruses
are resistant to low pH values, various detergents and
heating at 60°C for 5 minutes. Replication occurs in the
cytoplasm of host cells, and virions are released by cell
lysis. Trypsin is required for cultivation of these viruses.
The family contains two genera: Avastrovirus, whose
members infect avian species, and Mamastrovirus, whose
members infect mammalian species (Fig. 78.2). Species
are designated according to the host of origin while
serotypes are defined by cross-neutralization tests. Two
serotypes of bovine astrovirus and two serotypes of turkey
astrovirus are recognized.
Clinical infections
Astroviruses, which are distributed worldwide, have been
detected in the faeces of humans, cattle, pigs, sheep, dogs.
cats, deer, chickens, ducks and turkeys. Transmission
occurs by the faecal-oral route. Isolates from different host
species are antigenically distinct and host species-specific.
Infections are mild in most species. Mamastroviruses are
associated with self-limiting gastroenteritis in animals and
1840
humans. Following an incubation period of up to 4 days.
diarrhoea may develop. Infections with avastroviruses may
be severe and frequently involve a number of organs (Koci
and Schultz-Cherry, 2002). In ducklings, a severe hepatitis
may develop, while kidney lesions have been found in
birds infected with chicken astro-virus (avian nephritis
virus); turkey astro virus 2 is associated with poult enteritis
mortality syndrome(PEMS)
Key points
· Small,  single-stranded  RNA  viruses  with
icosahedral symmetry
· Replicate in the cytoplasm
·Two genera, Avastrovirus and Mamastrovinus,

Diagnosis is based on the detection of astroviruses in
faeces using electron microscopy or ELISA. Detection of
viral RNA using reverse transcriptase PCR (Koci et al.,
2000; Day et al., 2007) and virus isolation in primary cell
lines or embryonated eggs are also possible. Apart from a
vaccine for duck astrovirus, vaccines for other astroviruses
viruses are usually mild. Control is based on husbandry
practices appropriate for the prevention of enteritis in
young animals.

Coronaviridae
Members of the family Coronaviridae (Latin corona,
crown) are large, pleomorphic, enveloped viruses. They
contain a single molecule of linear, positive-sense,
single-stranded RNA. Club-shaped glycoprotein peplomers
projecting  from  the  envelope
impartacrown-like
appearance to the virus (Fig. 79.1). Each peplomer is
composed of a large viral trimeric glyco-protein (spike or
S protein) which is responsible for attachment to cells and
fusion between the envelope and plasma membrane. The S
protein is the main antigenic component which induces the
production   of  neutralizing  antibodies  during  natural
infection. Hypervariable domains in the S protein facilitate
the production of virus escape mutants capable of evading
the host immune response. Along with the family
Arteriviridae, the family Coronaviridae belongs to the
order  Nidovirales.  A major  reorganization   of  the
Coronaviridae has been accepted recently in which the
family will be divided into two subfamilies, Coronavirinae
and Torovirinae (Fig. 79.2). Coronaviruses, which are
almost spherical with a diameter of 120 to 160 nm, have
helical nucleocapsids. Toroviruses, which have a tubular
nucleocapsid, may be disc-shaped, kidney-shaped or
rod-shaped and are 120 to 140 nm in diameter. The
Coronavirinae subfamily will comprise three genera,
Alphacoronavirus,
Betacorona-virus
and
Gammacoronavirus. Closely-related virus species are to be
grouped together
and
renamed
as
 follows:
alphacoronavirus 1 (comprising feline coro-navirus, canine
1844
coronavirus   and
[transmissible
gastroenteritis virus);
betacoronavirus 1 (comprising human enteric coronavirus,
human coronavirus OC43, bovine coronavirus, porcine
haemagglutinating
 encephalomyelitis
virus,
equine
coronavirus and the newly-recognized canine respiratory
coronavirus); avian coronavirus (comprising
imfectious
bronchitis virus, turkey coronavirus, pheasant coronavirus,
duck coronavirus,
， goose  coronavirus  and
pigeon
coronavirus). The subfamily Torovirinae will comprise
two genera, Torovirus and the newly-created Bafinivirus,
which contains a virus of fish.

emergence of genetically divergent strains. Genetic
recombination can occur at high frequency between related
choice’ mechanism.

With the exception of infectious bronchitis virus,
coronaviruses are usually difficult to grow in cell culture.
The virions are sensitive to heat, lipid solvents,
formaldehyde, oxidizing agents and non-ionic detergents.
The stability of coronaviruses at low pH values is variable;
some are stable at values as low as pH 3.0.
Clinical infections
Coronaviruses can infect a number of mammalian and
avian species and many display tropisms for respiratory
and intestinal epithelium. The coronaviruses of veterinary
importance and the clinical consequences of infection are
indicated in Table 79.1. Infections, which are usually mild
or inapparent in mature animals, may be severe in young
animals. Coronaviruses are aetiologically important in
humans as a cause of the common cold. A recently
described member of the family that is capable of causing
serious illness in humans, severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) virus, is believed to have been acquired
from another animal species. The Chinese horseshoe bat
may have been the source of infection.
Although evidence of torovirus infection has been found in
pigs, sheep, goats and cats (Muir et al., 1990), the clinical
significance of these infections is questionable. Two
toroviruses have been implicated in enteric diseases of
domestic animals (Table 79.2)

aetiologically implicated in FIP. It is now clear that FIPV
arises as a mutant of the widely distributed FECV resulting
in an alteration in tropism from exclusively enteric
epithelial cells to the inclusion of the myeloid cells,
monocytes and macrophages (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985 ;
Poland et al., 1996; Rottier et al., 2005). Current thinking
envisages a single virus termed feline coronavirus (FCoV)
which encompasses strains of varying virulence that can be
grouped
1 broadly
into
two
biotypes,  enteric and
FIP-associated. Genomic studies have shown a high degree
of genetic related-ness between isolates of the two strains
from the same location (Vennema et al., 1998). A mutation
in the 3c gene, which encodes a small protein of unknown
function, is considered to be responsible for the altered cell
tropism of FIPV isolates (Pedersen, 2009). The parent
FECV displays a strong tropism for mature apical
epithelium of the intestine, while FIPV isolates display an
enhanced ability  to replicate in macrophages.  Two
serotypes of FCoV are described, both of which can cause
FIP. Serotype l accounts for most field infections in
Europe and  North America  whereas serotype
：2
predominates in Japan. Serotype 2 is thought to have
arisen as a result of a recombinational event between
FCoV and canine coronavirus (Herrewegh et al., 1998)
Epidemiology
1848
Feline infectious peritonitis occurs sporadically in catteries
or multicat households. The incidence is reported to be
higher in pedigree cats (Sparkes et al., 1992). Although
cats of any age may be affected, those less than 1 year of
age appear to be most susceptible. A second peak of
disease in cats over 10 years of age has been noted (Barr.
1998). Infected cats shed virus in faeces and oronasal
secretions. Transmission is mainly by the faecal - oral
route. Litter boxes are considered to be the main source of
infection in groups of cats. Infection is acquired by young
kittens from their mothers or from other adult cats (Addie
and Jarrett, 1992). In infected multiple-cat households,
about 40% of cats shed virus in their faeces at any given
time, while about 15% of cats are persistently-infected
carriers, responsible for maintaining the infection. While
the majority of cats may be transiently infected with a
particular strain of virus, reinfection with a different strain
can occur. Shedding and transmission of the mutated,
FIP-associated virus does not appear to occur under natural
circumstances.

Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of FIP is outlined in Fig. 79.3. Infection
with FIPV does not always result in clinical disease; about
one in nine FCoV-infected cats go on to develop FIP.
Factors which may influence the development of the
disease include the age, immune status and genetic
characteristics of the host and the emergence of virulent
virus strains (Addie et al., 1995). Any stressful episode
experienced during FCoV infection may predispose a cat
to develop FIP. Following mutational changes in the virus.
the emergence of a virulent FIPV strain results in systemic
kittens, the development of effective cell-mediated
immunity (CMI) restricts viral replication and ultimately
1851
eliminates infection. Some individual animals with less
effective CMI may shed virus intermittently while
remaining clinically normal. When CMI is severely
impaired or defective, virus replication continues leading
to B cell activation and the production of non-protective
antibodies. The immune complexes, formed from these
antibodies and FIPV, activate complement leading to
immune-mediated vasculitis. The severity of this vasculitis
influences the clinical presentation and the rate of
     s  o iss
hypersensitivity,  there  is evidence of type 　IV
hypersensitivity in FIPV-induced lesions (Paltrinieri et al.,
1998a,b). In experimentally induced FIP, an enhanced
form of the disease may occur in cats that already possess
antibodies to FCoV.Itisthought that this
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is the result of
opsonizing antibodies facilitating the uptake of FCoV by
macrophages (Hartmann, 2005). Failure to develop
effective vaccines for FIP has been attributed to the
development of antibodies which promote uptake of virus
by macrophages rather than neutralizing antibodies.
Clinical signs
The incubation period ranges from weeks to months. The
onset of clinical signs may be either sudden or slow and
insidious. Early signs, which are generally non-specific,
include anorexia, weight loss, listlessness and dehydration.
Affected cats often present with icterus.
Cats with the effusive form of the disease have fibrin-rich
exudates in the abdominal or thoracic cavities. If the
pleural effusion is marked, dyspnoea develops. The
1852
effusive form of the disease usually leads to death within 8
weeks.
In the non-effusive form of FIP, clinical findings are less
characteristic. Signs referable to lesions in organs or
tissues in the abdominal cavity are present in about 50% of
affected  cats.  Anterior  uveitis,  chorioretinitis  and
neurological signs may be evident in up to 30% of cases.
The course of the disease is usually protracted with
animals surviving for weeks or months. Infection with
feline leukaemia virus or with feline immunodeficiency
virus may increase susceptibility to FIPV and contribute to
the severity of the clinical signs.
Diagnosis
Currently, histological examination of affected tissues is the
only procedure available for the definitive diagnosis of FIP.
 [mmunohistochemical demonstration of FCoV antigen in
tissue macrophages is confirmatory. However, invasive
techniques are required to obtain the appropriate tissue
samples.
Pleural or peritoneal fluid, which may contain fibrin strands,
clots on standing. It has a high protein content. A gamma
globulin content exceeding 32% of total protein is suggestive
of FIP (Weiss, 1991). Detection of FCoV antigen in
macrophages in the body fluid correlates with FIP but in
some cases macrophage numbers in effusion smears are too
low for detection of the virus.

·A serum hyperproteinaemia is frequently present due to a
hypergammaglobulinaemia. Serum liver enzymes and total
bilirubin may also be raised.
· Diagnostic serological tests, including [FA and ELISA can
be used to quantify antibody levels to FCoV. Considering
that a large proportion of the cat population is
 g i      o
healthy cats, particularly cats from multiple-cat households,
titres should be interpreted with caution. When determined
by indirect immunofluorescence, antibody titres may be high
in some FIP cases, while antibody titres are negligible in
Other cases (Sparkes et al., 1991).
· Reverse transcriptase PCR can be used to detect viral RNA
in blood and in pleural/peritoneal effusions (Hartmann,
2005). It has also been used to
detect the shedding of virus in faeces and for the
identification of carriers (Addie and Jarrett, 200l ; Addie et
af., 2004). Unfortunately it has not been possible to design
primers capable of distinguishing FIP-causing FCoV from
enteric FCoV. In terms of ante-mortem testing of suspect
FIP cases, the detection of messenger RNA within
circulating monocytes by RT-PCR is considered the most
reliable (Simons et af., 2005)
Treatment and control
Specific treatment for FIP is not available, and cats with
clinical  FIP  eventually  die. Supportive  therapy and
broad-spectrum antibiotics may be useful for treating
affected cats in good physical condition (Weiss, 1994).
Immunosuppressive and antinflammatory treatments may
slow the progression of the disease but do not prevent the
inevitable fatal outcome.
An intranasal vaccine employing a temperature-sensitive
mutant strain of serotype 2 FIPV has been developed. It is
considered to be safe and does not induce ADE. Although
1855
reports of some efficacy trials have been favourable
Postorino Reeves et al., 1992; Hoskins et al., 1994; Fehr
et al., 1997), other studies have failed to demonstrate
significant protective immunity. The vaccine is licensed
for cats older than 16 weeks. However, kittens in
multiple-cat households where FCoV is present are often
already infected and seropositive by that age.
The creation and maintenance of coronavirus-negative
catteries is an effective method of control but is extremely
difficult to achieve. Measures aimed at reducing the
incidence of the disease include observing strict hygiene.
avoiding large numbers of cats in single households.
breeding from bloodlines free of FIP, rearing litters of
kittens in isolation (Addie and Jarrett, 1990) and reducing
stress in catteries.
Canine coronavirus infection
The ability of canine coronavirus (CCoV), now referred to
as alphacoronavirus 1, to cause disease is variable and the
agent can be isolated from normal dogs and those with
diarrhoea (Tennant et al., 1993). Two genetic types have
been recognized: CCoV type 1 and CCoV type 2 (Pratelli
et al., 2003). Highly virulent variants of CCoV have
occasionally been described (Decaro and Buonavoglia,
2008). The virus is related antigenically to the feline
coronaviruses. A genetically and antigenically distinct
virus, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), has been
described and is associated with mild respiratory disease,
particularly 1n kennelled dogs (Erles and Brownlie, 2008)
Epidemiology
1856
Serological studies indicate that infection is common
(Tennant et al., 1991). Infections with CCoV may spread
Seroprevalence may approach 100% in kennels and range
from 6% to 75% in pet dog populations. The prevalence of
CCoV in a cross-section of dogs presenting at veterinary
clinics, as determined by RT-PCR, was 2.8% (Stavisky et
al., 2010).
Infection is acquired from the faeces of infected animals.
Infected dogs usually shed the virus for up to 9 days and
intermittent shedding may continue for months. The virus
is not particularly resistant in the environment and carrier
dogs are required for its maintenance. Mucosal immunity
appears to be more important than circulating antibody for
protection of dogs from reinfection. In the absence of
frequent re-exposure to the virus, the duration of immunity
may be relatively short
Pathogenesis
Canine coronaviruses withstand the acidic environment of
the stomach and infect enterocytes in the duodenum.
Infection spreads rapidly involving other parts of the small
intestine. Diarrhoea may follow loss of digestive and
absorptive capacity in the small intestine as a result of
damage to mature enterocytes at the tips of villi. Recovery
is rapid in uncomplicated cases.
Clinical signs
Although clinical disease has been recorded in dogs, foxes
and coyotes, infection with CCoV is often asymptomatic

Dogs of all ages can become infected; serious illness is
most likely to occur in pups. The incubation period is up to
3 days. Clinical signs, which are variable and non-specific.
include anorexia, depression, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Most animals recover in 7 to 10 days. Occasionally, illness
may be protracted due to secondary bacterial, parasitic or
other viral infections. The mortality rate is low.

Transmissible gastroenteritis
1858
Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious,
coronaviral  disease
e of young pigs which
occurs
worldwide. There is one serotype of transmissible
gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) which is closely related
antigenically to feline coronavirus and canine coronavirus
and all three viruses are now considered a single species
and referred to as alphacoronavirus 1.A relatively
non-pathogenic respiratory variant of TGEV, referred to as
porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), was  first
recognized in 1984. This virus, a deletion mutant of
TGEV, spread to pig populations in many European
countries and has now been identified in the USA and in
some Asian countries. Infection with PRCV is usually
subclinical.
Epidemiology
Transmission of TGEV is usually by the faecal - oral
route. The virus is moderately stable in the presence of
proteolytic enzymes and at pH 3.0, ensuring survival in the
stomach and small intestine. Viral shedding in faeces can
persist for up to 2 weeks. Outbreaks of TGE tend to occur
in winter. In fully susceptible herds, the virus spreads
rapidly infecting animals of all ages. The disease is,
however, most severe in newborn piglets. Outbreaks
usually terminate in a few weeks if no new susceptible
animals are introduced into the herd.
Pathogenesis
Following ingestion, the virus replicates mainly in mature
enterocytes at the tips of the villi in the small intestine
Viral replication results in villous atrophy throughout the
1859
length of the small intestine. Digestion and cellular
transport of nutrients and electrolytes are severely
disrupted resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the
intestinallumen and diarrhoea. Young piglets are
particularly susceptible to the ensuing dehydration and
metabolic acidosis.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 3 days. Vomiting and
watery diarrhoea may be evident in affected piglets less
than 7 days old. Rapid dehydration and weight loss follow
The disease is usually confined to piglets under 3 weeks of
age and, in newborn piglets, mortality may approach
100%. Inappetence and transient diarrhoea may be
observed in older pigs. Subclinical infections also occur.
Sows quickly become immune, and maternally-derived
immunity, lactogenic IgA, reduces the severity of clinical
signs in piglets. Outbreaks usually last a few weeks.
However, TGEV infection may become endemic in a herd
if
 consecutive
litters
become
infected
as
maternally-derived  immunity
wanes. Clinically, such
infections are usually mild.
Diagnosis
The sudden onset and rapid spread of diarrhoea among
newborn pigs along with almost 10o% mortality is highly
suggestive of TGE. Post-mortem examination of washed
small intestine discloses paper-thin walls due to villous
atrophy. The walls of the jejunum and ileum are affected
whereas those of the duodenum are usually normal.
1860
· Viral antigen can be detected in mucosal smears or cryostat
sections of the small intestine by immunofluorescence. It
may be necessary to euthanize some piglets in the early
stages of the disease in order to obtain suitable specimens for
laboratory examination. Viral antigens can be demonstrated
in faeces by ELISA.
·Virus can be isolated from faeces in a swine testis cell line.
· Reverse transcriptase PCR assays for the detection of TGEV
and differentiation from PRCV are available (Paton et af.,
1997).
 Serological testing for antibodies can be carried out using
virus neutralization. However, virus neutralization does not
distinguish antibodies to TGEV from those induced by
PRCV infection. Competitive
blocking ELISAs, which are based on the use of monoclonal
antibody directed against a glycoprotein epitope present in
TGEV but absent from PRCV, can be used to distinguish
infections caused by these two viruses. These assays are
available commercially.
Treatment and control
Specific treatment is not available but fluid replacement
therapy may be beneficial. Maintaining the farrowing house
at an optimal temperature may enhance survival.
· In acute outbreaks of TGE, deliberate exposure of pregnant
sows to the virus may reduce neonatal mortality. After
exposure, sows due to farrow should be moved to clean
premises. Newborn piglets born to exposed sows will
usually   receive   passive   antibody   protection   through
colostrum.
·Modified live and inactivated  vaccines are available.
Modified live vaccines are administered orally to sows 5 to 7
weeks before farrowing and  a booster inoculation is
administered   parenterally   1  week   before   parturition.
Vaccination reduces mortality but does not eliminate
infection.
1861
·Serious outbreaks of TGE have become rare in European pig
populations endemically infected with PRCV. Porcine
Sows infected with PRCV usually transfer substantial
colostral protection to their litters (Wesley and Woods,
1993).
Porcine epidemic diarrhoea
This porcine disease, which is clinically similar to TGE
occurs in Europe and Asia. There is only one serotype of
porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), a coronavirus
serologically unrelated to TGEV.
Epidemiology
The virus is transmitted by the faecal - oral route. Spread
of the virus to susceptible herds occurs directly through
infected pigs and indirectly through contaminated fomites
or vehicles. The rate of spread of infection within a farm is
slower than that of TGEV
Pathogenesis
Virus replication occurs in epithelial cells in the small
intestine and colon. In the small intestine, shortening of
villi occurs. The rate and severity of cell destruction is less
marked than with TGEV.
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 4 days. The age of animals
affected and the associated morbidity and mortality are
variable. On some farms, animals of all ages become sick
1862
and the mortality rate in piglets under 1 week may
approach 50%. Watery diarrhoea, which may be preceded
by
vomiting，isthe
main clinicalpresentation.
Occasionally a few animals die suddenly, with back
muscle necrosis evident post mortem. The virus may
persist on large breeding farms by infecting consecutive
litters of pigs. Most affected pigs recover after about 1
week and mortality rates are usually low.
Diagnosis
· Direct immunofluorescence, using cryostat sections of small
intestine from pigs euthanized during the phase of acute
diarrhoea, is sensitive and reliable, particularly in specimens
from newborn piglets.
·Viral antigen may be detected by ELISA in faecal material
or intestinal contents collected during the acute phase of the
disease.
·A duplex RT-PCR designed to detect and to differentiate
PEDV and TGEV has been described (Kim et al., 200l,
2007).
·Antibodies can be detected in paired serum samples using a
blocking ELISA or by indirect immunofluo-rescence on
PEDV-positive cryostat sections of intestine.
Treatment and control
·Specific treatment is not available. Vaccines are not
generally available but an oral attenuated vaccine has been
developed in South Korea (Song et al., 2007).
Appropriate hygienic measures and control of animal and
human movement between farms are necessary measures for
disease prevention.
· During an outbreak of the disease on a breeding farm, good
hygiene slows the spread of infection. Deliberate spread of
the virus to pregnant sows using infected faecal material
1863
stimulates colostral immunity and shortens the course of a
disease outbreak.
Porcine
haemagglutinating
 encephalomyelitis
virus
infection
This coronavirus disease of young pigs, also known as
vomiting and wasting disease, is caused by porcine
haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of which
there is only one serotype. The virus agglutinates red cells
of several animal species
Epidemiology
Infection is common and probably worldwide. The virus is
shed  in nasal secretions and readily  transmitted by
aerosols. Infection persists on breeding farms as a
subclinical respiratory condition. In herds where infection
is endemic, immune sows transfer protective antibodies to
their offspring and piglets are protected until they have
developed an age-related resistance. Pigs which become
subclinically infected develop an active immunity at 8 to
16 weeks of age.
Pathogenesis
The virus replicates locally in the upper respiratory tract
and tonsils before spreading via the peripheral nervous
system to the medulla oblongata. It then spreads to other
parts of the central nervous system. Viral damage to the
vagal sensory ganglion and to the intramural plexus of the
stomach are considered to be responsible for vomiting and
delayed gastric emptying, respectively.
1864
Clinical signs
Clinical signs develop in pigs less than 3 weeks of age
after an incubation period of up to 7 days. Signs range
from
　acute
 encephalomyelitis  characterized
incoordination, convulsions and high mortality to vomiting
and wasting, where the principal signs include vomiting,
dehydration and emaciation. Newborn piglets become
severely dehydrated and may die. The mortality rate is
often 100% in young pigs. Older pigs continue to vomit
and become emaciated. Survivors may be permanently
stunted.
Diagnosis
·  For the isolation of virus or demonstration of viral antigen in
cryostat sections by immunofluorescence, samples of brain
stem must be collected within 2 days of the onset of clinical
signs. Porcine thyroid cells are suitable for virus isolation.
·  Lesions  of  non-suppurative encephalomyelitis may be
evident.
· Viral RNA may be detected using reverse transcriptase and
nested PCR assays (Sekiguchi et al., 2004).
A significant rise in antibody titre may be demonstrable in
paired
1serumsamples
byvirusneutralization
haemagglutination-inhibition tests.
Treatment and control
·Specific treatment is not available.
·Due to the sporadic nature of the disease, vaccination is
unwarranted.
·Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent the
introduction of infection into breeding units. If infection is
introduced, it is important to ensure that infection of sows
results in an adequate antibody response for the protection of
1865
litters. To ensure that they are exposed to the virus in
advance of pregnancy, gilts should be integrated into the
herd before breeding commences.
Infectious bronchitis
Infectious  bronchitis,  caused   by
   avian   coronavirus
(infectious bronchitis virus, IBV), is a highly contagious,
economically important, worldwide disease of poultry
which affects the respiratory, reproductive and renal
systems. Many serotypes are recognized, often with
different virulence and tissue tropisms, probably as a result
of mutation or recombination.
Epidemiology
The chicken is the main host although IBV has been
isolated from pigeons and pheasants. The most important
route of transmission is by aerosols, and spread of
infection   occurs  rapidly   among
susceptiblebirds
Morbidity may approach 100%. Virus, shed from the
respiratory tract for a few weeks after infection, may be
recovered over a period of weeks from the faeces and from
eggs of infected birds. Infection may persist in the
digestive tract of individual birds. Several serotypes can
co-circulate in a region and, as serotypes cross-protect
poorly, chickens can acquire infection on more than one
occasion (Cavanagh, 2007).
Pathogenesis
The respiratory system is the primary site of virus
replication. Viraemia follows within 1 to 2 days of
exposure.   The   virus   becomes
 widelydistributed
1866
throughout the body, particularly in the oviducts, kidneys
and bursa of Fabricius. The distribution and severity of
lesions in these tissues are influenced by the virulence of
the infecting strain and the breed of chicken (Cavanagh,
2007).
Clinical signs
The incubation period is up to 48 hours. Age, immune
status and strain of virus strongly influence the nature
and severity of disease observed in a flock. In general,
disease is most severe in young birds, particularly when
secondary infections are present. In chickens less than 3
weeks of age, there is gasping and nasal exudate present.
Infection may result in stunting and some birds may die
suddenly from occluded bronchi. In older birds, rales and
gasping are usually observed. Mortality rates are generally
low in the absence of secondary infections. The course of
the disease is up to 7 days in individual birds and
outbreaks last about 10 to 14 days in flocks. Layers show
signs of rales followed by a marked reduction in egg
production which slowly returms to normal. Poor egg
quality, with soft-shelled and misshapen eggs, may
continue for several weeks. A relatively new strain, termed
QX, was first described in China in 1996 and is associated
with cystic oviducts. Affected birds stand with their heads
held up due to an enlarged abdomen, the result of large
fluid-filled cysts in the oviducts. Infection with
nephrotropic strains of IBV is associated with interstitial
nephritis and mild respiratory signs with moderate to high
levels of mortality.
Diagnosis
1867
Virus isolation is often feasible in the acute stage of the
preferred for virus isolation, samples from kidney, oviduct
and faeces can also be used. Material is usually inoculated
into the allantoic sac of 9 to 10-day-old embryonated eggs.
A number of passages may be required to produce the
characteristic stunting and curling of the embryo. Tracheal
explants from day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks may be
used for antigenic typing of isolates by virus neutralization.
· The detection and typing of isolates can be accomplished
using real-time RT - PCR (Callison et af., 2005).
 Serological tests, including virus neutralization, agar gel
can be used to demonstrate a rise in antibody titre between
acute and convalescent serum samples.
Treatment and control
·Specific treatment is not available. The administration of
 s   a   si
infections.
·Both live and killed vaccines with adjuvant are available.
Protection tends to be short-lived and serotype-specific.
Consequently, vaccination on a number of occasions and
with more than one sero-type is usual. Live vaccines are
usually administered in the drinking water or by aerosol to
chicks up to 14 days of age and again at about 4 weeks of
age. A high-passage vaccinal virus, which is less virulent, is
used for primary immunization. A more virulent strain of
virus is used for booster vaccination. Following primary
immunization with live vaccines, killed vaccines inoculated
shortly before the birds start laying eggs are useful in layer
and breeder flocks to prevent losses in egg production and to
ensure a high level of yolk-sac-derived immunity in chicks.
Bovine coronavirus infection
1868
Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is one of the causes of calf
diarrhoea and is also associated with winter dysentery in
adult housed cattle. There is evidence of its involvement in
the bovine respiratory disease complex (Kapil and Goyal,
1995). The virus, which exists as a single serotype,
haemagglutinates red cells of mice, rats and hamsters.
Epidemiology and pathogenesis
Virus is mainly transmitted by the faecal - oral route.
However, coronaviruses have also been recovered from the
respiratory tract of calves (McNulty et al., 1984) and
infected calves often harbour BCV in both the enteric and
respiratory tracts (Thomas et al., 2006). Infection is
usuallyendemic
on
farms, maintained
 by
clinically-affected  calves and persistently-infected, but
clinically normal, calves and cows. The virus replicates
and destroys mature enterocytes in the small intestine and
colon, resulting in a malabsorptive diarrhoea. The severity
of disease is influenced by the age of the animal at the time
of infection and type of management. Risk factors, which
include changes in diet, cold temperatures, close
confinement and the presence of other microorganisms
       
important in the development and pathogenesis of winter
dysentery.
Clinical signs
In calves, the incubation period is up to 2 days and clinical
signs are usually observed between 3 and 30 days of age
There is profuse diarrhoea which may result in
dehydration, acidosis and death. With appropriate
1869
treatment, the diarrhoea usually ceases in a few days
Respiratory tract infections are generally mild but may
predispose to more severe secondary infections.
In adult animals the incubation period of winter dysentery
is 3 to 7 days. There is a sudden onset of diarrhoea
accompanied by a dramatic drop in milk yield. The faeces
of some animals may contain blood or blood clots. A
nasolacrimal discharge and cough may accompany  the
diarrhoea. Herd outbreaks can last for 2 weeks.
Diagnosis
·Faeces or intestinal contents for laboratory examination
should be collected early in the course of the disease.
·Typical coronavirus particles can be demonstrated in faecal
samples by direct electron microscopy (EM). Immune EM is
preferable as it is more sensitive and specific. Alternative
diagnostic methods of detection include ELISA and reverse
passive haemagglutination.
 [mmunofluorescence can be used to detect viral antigen in
cryostat sections of distal small intestine or colon.
·RT-PCR, nested PCR and real-time PCR assays are
available for detection of bovine coronavirus RNA in
clinical samples (Cho et af., 2001; Decaro et af., 2008).
·Isolation of virus in tissue culture is difficult.
· Antibodies to BCV are widespread in cattle, and serological
assays, including virus neutralization, ELISA and
haemagglutination inhibition, are of limited value for
diagnosis.
Treatment and control
Treatment is supportive but non-specific. Control of the
disease in calves is based on vaccination and good
management practices including thorough cleaning and
1870
disinfection,  good  ventilation  to reduce  airborme
transmission and ensuring an adequate intake of colostrum.
To avoid transmission to susceptible calves, animals of
different age groups should not be mixed. Both live and
inactivated vaccines have been developed and can be used
orally in calves to stimulate active immunity. The presence
of maternal antibodies to BCV in colostrum-fed calves
may interfere with the efficacy of oral vaccination.
Alternatively, vaccines may be administered parenterally
in cows to increase the level of antibody in colostrum and
milk. A vaccine is not available at present for the
prevention of winter dysentery in adult animals.

Arteriviridae
Arteriviruses, formerly classified as members of the family
Togaviridae,  have
 been assigned to thefamily
Arteriviridae. Their genome organization and mode of
replication are similar to those of members of the
Coronaviridae and these two families are part of the order
Nidovirales. In the family Arteriviridae there is a single
genus, Arterivirus. The name of the family and genus
derives from the disease, equine arteritis, which is caused
by the type species. Arteriviruses are spherical, 40 to 60
nm in diameter and possess a lipid- containing envelope
carrying small projections (Fig. 80.1). There are two major
and four minor envelope proteins, four of which are
glycoproteins. The icosahedral nucleocapsid contains a
molecule of linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA.
Replication takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells
and is characterized by the formation of double-membrane
vesicles that probably carry the replication complex.
Preformed nucleocapsids bud into the lumen of smooth
intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and/
or the Golgi complex. The enveloped virions accumulate
in intracellular vesicles, which are transported to the cell
membrane for release by exocytosis. Arteriviruses are
relatively labile, being sensitive to heat, low pH, lipid
solvents, detergent treatment, UV irradiation and many
disinfectants.
Clinical infections
1880
Members of the genus are host-specific and antigenically
unrelated. Infections have been described in horses, pigs,
mice  and
1 monkeys. The primary target cells are
macrophages. Infection is spread horizontally by aerosol,
by biting or by venereal transmission. Infections are
frequently persistent.

reproductive and respiratory syndrome
Equine viral arteritis
Although infection with equine arteritis virus (EAV)
occurs worldwide, outbreaks of clinical disease are
ventral oedema  and  abortion  are prominent  clinical
features. Biological and genomic differences have been
demonstrated in isolates of EAV but antigenic variation is
limited. Only one serotype has been recognized.
Epidemiology
Horses, donkeys and mules are susceptible to infection.
The percentage of seropositive animals is higher in
Standardbreds  than  in   Thoroughbreds.  Whether  this
reflects differences in susceptibility or in degree of
1881
exposure as a result of management practices is unclear.
Although infection is prevalent in some horse populations,
outbreaks of disease are sporadic.The frequency of
confirmed outbreaks of equine viral arteritis has increased
in recent years. Factors which may have contributed to this
increase  include increased international movement of
horses, more extensive use of artificial insemination and
greater awareness of the disease.

electron micrograph and a diagrammatic representation
(inset).
100mm
During the acute phase of infection, virus is spread
primarily by aerosols from the respiratory tract. Virus is
1882
also shed in faeces, urine and vaginal secretions. Close
contact facilitates spread of infection. Virus is usually
eliminated from mares and geldings within 1 to 2 months
but may persist in about 35% of infected stallions. Carrier
stallions are asymptomatic and shed virus continuously in
semen. More than 80% of mares covered by carrier
stallions may become infected. Persistent infection, which
does not impair the fertility of stallions, appears to be
testosterone- dependent (McCollum et al., 1994). Mares
infected venereally may spread virus horizontally via the
respiratory route to in-contact susceptible animals. Mares
do not become persistently infected. Abortion or infection
of the foal may result when pregnant mares are infected.
Pathogenesis and pathology
Following aerosol transmission, replication occurs in
pulmonary macrophages. There is subsequent spread to the
bronchial  lymph  nodes  and  viraemia.  Pathological
changes, arising from infection of endothelial cells and
widespread necrotic arteritis, include oedema, congestion
and haemorrhage in many tissues. Aborted foetuses, which
often exhibit autolysis, rarely display characteristic lesions
Clinical signs
The incubation period ranges from 3 to 14 days. Many
infections are subclinical. The disease tends to be more

anorexia, depression, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and stiff gait.
Oedema, which is usually prominent, may involve the
eyelids, ventral abdomen and limbs, particularly the hind
1883
limbs. Urticarial-type lesions commonly affect the skin of
the neck. Acute, often fatal, respiratory disease has been
recorded in foals (Del Piero et al., 1997). Affected horses
almost invariably make a full recovery and are usually
immune for several years. Clinical signs in donkeys are
similar to those in horses but generally milder.
Diagnosis
Because equine viral arteritis resembles a number of other
equine diseases in its clinical presentation, definitive
diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation. Internationally
accepted  testing   procedures 
　have   been    published
(Tim0ney, 1996; 0IE, 2008)
· Virus isolation is carried out in appropriate cell lines such as
rabbit or equine kidney cells. Samples suitable for isolation
 procedures include nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs,
placental tissue and foetal tissue and fluids.
Viral RNA can be detected in semen and other specimens
using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A
variety of protocols have been published (OlE, 2008).
· Acute and convalescent blood samples can be submitted for
serology. The virus neutralization test, considered to be
sensitive and highly specific, is the most widely used test
and is usually carried out in microtitre plates with the
addition of complement to enhance sensitivity.
·Carrier stallions can be identified by serological testing. If
stallions are seropositive, virus isolation from semen should
be attempted. The sperm-rich fraction of semen is suitable
for virus isolation or RT-PCR. Alternatively, carrier animals
can be mated to seronegative mares which are monitored for
seroconversion.
Treatment
1884
Supportive therapy is indicated in severe cases. The carrier
state in stallions cannot be eliminated by chemotherapy.
Control
Persistently infected stallions should be identified and
either castrated or euthanized. In order to reduce the risk of
colt foals becoming carriers, vaccination at 6 to 12 months
of age is recommended (Timoney and McCollum, 1996).
Two types of vaccine are available commercially:
 A modified live tissue-culture-adapted vaccine induces good
protection against clinical disease but not against infection.
Use of this vaccine is contrain- dicated in pregnant mares
and in foals under 6 weeks of age. Vaccinated stallions do
not appear to develop the carrier state with vaccinal virus.
· An inactivated whole-virus vaccine with adjuvant is reported
to be safe for pregnant mares but requires booster injections
at 6-month intervals (Fukunaga, 1994).
Replicon particles, derived from a vaccine strain of
Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus expressing
the two major envelope proteins, have been shown to be
capable of inducing protective, neutralizing antibodies
(Balasuriya et al., 2002).
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
This economically important condition is characterized by
reproductive failure in sows and pneumonia in young pigs.
The syndrome was first described in the USA in 1987.
Despite attempts at controlling spread, the disease is now
endemic in many countries. The aetiological agent,
originally called Lelystad virus, was first isolated in the
Netherlands (Wensvoort et al., 1991). It was characterized
1885
as an arterivirus and renamed porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Significant antigenic
and genomic differences between European and American
isolates of the virus are evident, referred to as type I and
type II subspecies, respectively. However, type I isolates
have now been found in America, while type II isolates
have been introduced into Europe through the use of
modified live vaccine made from a North American
isolate.
Epidemiology
Natural infection occurs in pigs and wild boars. Virus.
which is shed in saliva, urine, semen and faeces, is highly
infectious. Nose-to-nose contact is considered to be the
most likely route of transmission. Airbome transmission
between farms was important during the early acute
outbreaks of the disease when large quantities of virus
were excreted. Now it appears to be important only when
pig population densities are high and when weather
conditions are suitable. Virus survival, which is prolonged
prevail, facilitates transmission. Infection is generally
introduced on to farms by infected pigs or by infected
semen. On endemically-infected farms, virus is transmitted
either continuously or in waves. Maintenance of infection
on farms is multifactorial (Albina, 1997). Maternally-
derived immunity is of such short duration that piglets
become susceptible to infection at 4 to 10 weeks of age.
Susceptible replacement  pigs  maintain  infection  in
endemic herds. Infection may spread in a slow and
unpredictable manner with the result that some animals in
infected herds remain susceptible. Immunocompetent pigs,
1886
which display a progressive decline in antibody levels over
a period of several months, may become susceptible to
reinfection. In experimentally  infected pigs, infection
persisted for up to 157 days (Wills et al., 1997).
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Infection occurs most frequently by the respiratory route.
The virus has an affinity for pulmonary alveolar
macrophages and the lungs are probably the target organs
(van Reeth, 1997). Early antibody responses are not
effective in clearing virus infection. Antibody- dependent
enhancement

macrophages has been described in the disease. After
transportation to regional lymph nodes, virus spreads to

immunosuppressive effect, it predisposes to infection with
other microorganisms such as Streptococcus suis, porcine
respiratory  corona-
virus  and Haemophilus parasuis
(Albina et al., 1998).
Clinical signs
Introduction of PRRSV to a breeding herd is usually
followed by reproductive failure which may take the form
1887
of abortions, early farrowing, increased numbers of
stillborm and mummified foetuses, weak neonatal
pigs and delayed return to service in affected sows. A
'rolling inappetence', progressively affecting animals in an
infected herd, has been described. In some cases, cyanosis
of the ears and vulva along with erythematous plaques on
the skin (blue-eared disease') have been described
are important features of the disease in neonatal pigs.
Subclinical infection is common. Factors which may
exacerbate clinical disease include concentrated numbers
of pigs, the virulence of the strain of PRRsV and the
presence of slatted floors. Although sporadic respiratory
and reproductive problems are the main clinical
manifestations in most affected herds, in a few
endemically- infected herds, chronic disease problems
predominate (Zimmermann et al., 1997). However, more
severe outbreaks with deaths occurring in both young and
adult pigs, and mortality rates averaging 20%, have been
described in China (Tian et al., 2007).
Diagnosis
·Laboratory confirmation is usually required because the
clinical
 presentation  is
variable,   particularly
in
endemically-infected herds.
·Serology is the most widely used diagnostic method. Several
serological tests are available including ELISA and an
immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. However, these tests
do not distinguish carrier from vaccinated animals.
Commercial assays are available (Okinga et al., 2009).
The presence of PRRSV may be demonstrated by virus
isolation, direct FA staining, in situ hybridization or reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Kleiboeker et af.,
1888
2005). Virus isolation is difficult, requiring the use of
porcine alveolar macrophages.  Suitable samples for
submission include serum, foetal fluids, spleen, tonsils,
lymph nodes and lung tissue. A multiplex PCR assay has
been designed to differentiate North American and European
PRRsV isolates (Gilbert et al., 1997).
Treatment
Specific treatment is not available. Supportive therapy and
antibiotic administration to suppress secondary infections
may be beneficial.
Control
Vaccination and effective hygiene and health management
are important for controlling infection.
·A commercial modified live vaccine is available for use in
pigs 3 to 18 weeks of age and is suitable for use in
non-pregnant sows before breeding. It is not suitable for use
in boars and pregnant sows or in herds free from PRRSV
infection. Spread of vaccinal  virus  to non-vaccinated
animals, in some instances resulting in clinical disease, has
been reported. An inactivated vaccine with adjuvant is also
available (Plana-Duran et af., 1997). Vaccination provides
reasonable protection from the clinical effects of infection.
Vaccines may contain type I or type Il viruses. It is
considered that vaccines containing virus closely related to
the circulating field virus provide the greatest benefit (Scortti
et al., 2007 ; Okuda et al., 2008).
Stabilization of the sow herd is required to avoid
subpopulations of non-immune sows and to break the cycle
of  reinfection.   Effective  isolation  and   acclimatization
procedures should be introduced before replacement sows
are added to the herd. Other control measures, relating to the
weaning and rearing of piglets on infected premises and to
1889
strategies for the elimination of infection from herds, have
been proposed (Dee and Joo, 1997) Dee and Molitor, 1998).

Flaviviridae
The family name of the Flaviviridae (Latin flavus, yellow)
is derived from yellow fever, a disease of humans caused
by a flavivirus with jaundice as a major clinical feature.
Members of the family are 40 to 60 nm in diameter with
icosahedral capsids and tightly adherent envelopes which
contain  either  two or
three virus-encoded proteins
depending on the genus (Fig. 81.1). The genome is
composed
of
positive-sense,
single-stranded
RNA
Replication of virus occurs in the cytoplasm with assembly
and envelopment taking place at intracellular membranes,
probably   endoplasmic  reticulum.  Viral  particles  are
transported in cytoplasmic vesicles through the secretory
pathway before release by exocytosis. The labile mature
virions are sensitive to heat, detergents and organic
solvents.
The family comprises three genera, namely Flavivirus,
Pestivirus and Hepacivirus (Fig. 81.2). Two genera,
Flavivirus and Pestivirus, contain viruses of veterinary
importance. The genus Flavivirus contains more than 50
members assigned to several serologically-defined groups.
Most members of the genus are arboviruses, which require
either mosquitoes or ticks as vectors. Viruses in the genus
agglutinate goose red cells. The genus Pestivirus contains
four viruses of veterinary importance, namely bovine viral
diarrhoea virus 1 and 2, border disease virus, and classical
swine fever virus. Pestiviruses possess four structural
proteins: a capsid protein and three envelope glycoproteins
1894
designated Erns (soluble ribonuclease), El and E2. The
immunodominant major glycoprotein, E2 (gp55) induces
neutralizing antibodies
Key points

· Most viruses in the genus Flavivirus are
transmitted by arthropods and cause encephalitis
Pestiviruses, which are transmitted directly or
indirectly. cause bovine viral diarrhoea, border
disease and classical swine fever
Clinical infections
In the genera Flavivirus and Pestivirus, there are several
viruses of particular veterinary importance (Table 81.1)
Four members of the genus Flavivirus, louping ill virus,
Japanese encephalitis virus, Wesselsbron virus and Israel
turkey meningoencephalitis
virus,  cause disease in
domestic animals. In addition, infection with West Nile
virus, an important human pathogen, causes fatal disease
in horses and, since 1999, has
       
dramatic spread across North America. Other members of
the genus which are important human pathogens include
yellow fever virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis
virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and St. Louis
encephalitis virus. The sole member of the Hepacivirus
1895
genus, hepatitis C virus, is an important cause of hepatitis
in humans.
The four recognized members of the Pestivirus genus
which infect domestic species are closely related
antigenically. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus can infect both
cattle and sheep, as well as other ruminants and pigs. On
the basis of sequence differences in the gene encoding the
envelope glycoprotein E2, six distinct genotypes have been
defined within the genus (van Rijn et al., 1997): classical
swine fever virus, border disease virus, classical bovine
viral diarrhoea virus (isolates predominantly from cattle),
atypical bovine viral diarrhoea virus (isolates from cattle,
sheep and pigs), deer pestivirus, and giraffe pestivirus. A
novel pestivirus genotype has been identified recently in
phylogenetic studies have suggested that there may be nine
species of pestiviruses (Liu et al., 2009). Pestivirus
infections may be inapparent, acute or persistent and are
economically important worldwide

Louping ill
The name
‘louping ill’derives from the Scottish
vernacular for “leaping’ or “bounding', an allusion to the
abnormal gait of some affected animals. Louping ill is a
viral disease primarily of sheep. Although the virus is
pathogenic for humans, infection is rare. The disease,
which is largely confined to Britain and Ireland, has also
been described in Norway, Spain, Bulgaria and Turkey.
Isolates from Spain and Turkey are distinct from each
other and also from isolates in Britain, Ireland and Norway
(Marin et al., 1995). Louping ill virus belongs to a group
of serologically-related viruses, the mammalian tick-borne
encephalitis group or complex. Members of this group are
distributed in northern temperate latitudes and are mainly
human pathogens.

Epidemiology
Louping ill virus is transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus
and the seasonal incidence and regional distribution of the
disease reflect periods of tick activity in suitable habitats
such as upland grazing. Two main periods of tick activity
occur, the first in spring and a second in late summer or
early autumn. The host range of I. ricinus is wide, and
infection with

virus is maintained in endemic areas through a sheep-tick

Trans-stadial but not transovarial transmission of the virus
occurs in the tick. Rarely, contaminated instruments may
be responsible for virus transmission. On farms where
infection is endemic, losses occur mainly in sheep under 2
years of age. Most sheep acquire life-long immunity.
Young lambs are protected by colostral antibody.
Pathogenesis
Viral replication occurs initially in lymph nodes draining
sites of inoculation. Viraemia follows with dissemination
to other lymphatic organs and to the brain and spinal cord.
The speed and onset of the immune response are important
in preventing spread of virus and limiting the degree of
damage in the central nervous system. Immunosuppression
caused by infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the
agent of tickborne fever, is considered to be responsible
for increased mortality in sheep with louping ill.
Clinical signs
Following infection, sheep develop a febrile response,
which may go unnoticed. The temperature then
returns to normal and, in a proportion of animals, rises
again as neurological signs develop. Signs of clinical
disease are highly variable ranging from ataxia to the rapid
onset of coma and death. Signs include hyperexcitability.
fine muscular tremor, incoordination and exaggerated limb
movements. Most affected animals develop convulsions
mild, residual neurological signs. In cattle, the course of
louping ill is more protracted.  Affected animals may
become recumbent but usually remain bright and many
1900
eventually recover. In humans, influenza-like clinical signs
are followed, in most cases, by mild neurological
disturbance.
Diagnosis
A history of neurological signs or unexplained deaths in
sheep in endemic areas during periods of tick activity may
indicate louping ill.  Laboratory confirmation is usually
required.
A non-suppurative encephalomyelitis is usually detectable
histologically. Lesions are most pronounced in the brain
stem and spinal cord. A specific diagnosis may be possible
antigen.
Specimens of brain, collected aseptically into 50% glycerol
saline, may  be  inoculated
into
tissue culture
or
intracerebrally into baby mice in order to isolate the virus.
· Detection of louping ill virus using an RT-PCR protocol has
been described (Gaunt et al., 1997; Marriott et al., 2006).
·Antibody to the virus can be detected using complement
fixation and gel diffusion tests. The virus agglutinates goose
red cells. Detection of IgM antibodies is indicative of acute
infection.
Treatment
Specific treatment is not available. Careful nursing and
sedation may aid recovery.
Control
 Inactivated vaccines are protective. In the past, formalized
vaccines produced from infected sheep brains were
responsible, in some instances, for causing scrapie in
vaccinated animals. Tissue- culture-derived virus is now
used for inactivated vaccines.
1901
· Animals to be retained for breeding are vaccinated at 6 to 12
months of age. Colostrum from vaccinated ewes usually
   eo  n a  s sd
injection may be advisable for ewes in their second
 pregnancy to enhance colostral antibody levels.
Dipping of sheep may also reduce risk of infection.
Japanese encephalitis
This disease, which mainly affects humans, has a wide
geographical distribution in Asia. Infection can occur in a
number of animal species including horses and pigs. The
virus is transmitted by mosquitoes (Culex species) and is
maintained by a mosquito-aquatic bird (egrets, herons)
cycle. The disease is of reduced importance in horses
because of their declining numbers in endemic areas and
the use of effective vaccines. The pig is an important
amplifying host because of its close association with
human populations in parts of Asia. Boars can transmit the
virus in semen. Infection can cause reproductive failure in
sows. Litters from infected sows may include mummified
and stillborn foetuses, weak piglets with neurological signs
and clinically-normal piglets. Confirmation is based on
virus isolation, detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR or the
demonstration of specific antibody. Both inactivated and
live attenuated vaccines have been used to control the
disease.
West Nile virus
West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Japanese
encephalitis virus serogroup. There are five distinct genetic
lineages: lineage l is the most widespread (la Europe,
1902
Africa, Americas and Asia; 1b Kunjin virus, Australia);
lineage 2 has occurred in Africa and has also been linked
to avian mortality in central Europe; lineages 3 and 4 have
been found in Russia; lineage 5 (formerly 1c) has been
identified in India. The viruses responsible for recent
   1     
was introduced to the Western hemisphere from the Old
World and spread rapidly. An increased number of cases
with severe and fatal neurological disease in humans,
horses and birds have been associated with this spread
The virus is transmitted in enzootic cycles involving Culex
species of mosquitoes and birds. Secondary transmission
cycles occur, typically in late summer, involving Aedes
species ("bridging
vectors) of mosquitoes, which
preferentially feed on mammals, and result in incidental
infections in humans and domestic animals. Bird
migrations may carry the virus into new geographical
areas. Infections in birds are frequently asymptomatic but
clinical signs and high mortality can occur in
crows, ravens, jays and geese. Only a small percentage of
infected  horses develop neurological disease.  Clinical
signs in horses include anorexia, depression, ataxia,
circling, head pressing and convulsions. Paralysis, coma
and death may follow in approximately 30% of cases.
Diagnosis and control
Cases of neurological disease in birds, particularly
Corvidae species, during the warm months of the year are
suggestive of WNVinfection.Sick birds are often
viraemic and virus may be present in blood, saliva and
droppings. Diagnostic  samples should be handled at
containment level three. Virus can be recovered from a
1903
cord are the preferred specimens from horses. Virus
isolation can be carried out in cell culture. Alternatively,
infection can be confirmed by detection of viral antigen by
immunoassay and immunohisto- chemistry or by detection
of viral RNA by RT-PCR (Johnson et al., 200l; Tewari et
al., 2004). The primary method of diagnosis of WNV
infection is by virus demonstration using PCR. Suitable
serological tests include ELISA and plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT). Antibody cross-reactions with
related flaviviruses can occur; the PRNT is the most
specific assay. Control is based on vaccination and a range
of vaccines are commercially available  for horses
including inactivated, canarypox-vectored vaccine, DNA
vaccine and a chimeric vaccine based on a yellow fever
virus vector.
Wesselsbron disease
This disease, caused by a flavivirus, has a wide host range
including domestic species, wild mammals and humans.
However, clinical disease is usually encountered in sheep;
infections in other species tend to be mild or subclinical.
Infection in humans may result in febrile influenza-like
symptoms.Thevirus
s is transmitted bymosquitoes.
Infection is widespread in sub- Saharan Africa. The
   a       
clinically less severe. It is characterized by abortion,
neonatal mortality and congenital abnormalities such as
hydranencephaly and arthrogryposis. The disease is most
severe in newborn lambs, which present with fever,
depression,  general
weakness
andpolypnoea.
Confirmation is based on virus isolation, intracerebral
1904
inoculation of baby mice and the demonstration of specific
antibody. An attenuated vaccine, which provides life-long
immunity, is available. Pregnant animals should not be
vaccinated because of the risk of abortion.
Bovine viral diarrhoea and mucosal disease
Infection with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), also
known as bovine virus diarrhoea virus, is common in cattle
populations throughout the world. The virus can cause
both acute disease, bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), and a
protracted form of illness, mucosal disease, arising from
persistent infection. Using cell culture, cytopathic and
non-cytopathic biotypes are recognized. The biotype most
often isolated from cattle populations is non-cytopathic.
Cytopathic isolates can arise from non-cytopathic BVDV
as a result of recombination events including incorporation
of host RNA and duplication of viral RNA sequences in
the NS2-3 gene resultingin cleavage of NS2-3 and
increased production of NS3 (Meyers et al., 1996). Two
genotypes, now considered separate species, BVDV 1
 )    (  )
         e
contain cytopathic and non-cytopathic isolates and produce
similar clinical syndromes in cattle. However, only type 2
isolates have been associated with thrombocytopenia and a
haemorrhagic syndrome, first described in North America
(Rebuhn et al., 1989). Based on phylogenetic analysis, 13
subgenotypes of BVDV 1 and two subgenotypes of BVDV
2 have been described.
Epidemiology
1905
When cattle are infected initially with BVDV, they shed
o i sna nsun a pu pod pous b o sni
animals. Persistently-infected (PI) animals, which shed
virus in secretions and excretions, are particularly
important sources  of infection.  Persistent  infection
develops   when   infection    of
thefoetuswith
la
non-cytopathic strain occurs before day 120 of gestation.
About 1% of animals in an infected population are
persistently infected
and
viraemic.
Although
persistently-Infected cows may breed successfully, they
can
1transmit virus transplacentally to calves during
successive gestations. This form of disease transmission is
relatively common. The presence of cattle with persistent
infection in a herd results in constant exposure of the other
cattle to virus, producing a high level of herd immunity. In
such herds, more than 80% of animals are serologically
positive.
Virus is excreted in the semen of both persistently and
transiently-infected bulls. Infection may be transmitted
through  natural  service  or  by  artificial  insemination.
Embryo transfer from animals with persistent or transient
infection can lead to infection in recipient cows. If
pregnant animals are inoculated with live
vaccines, their calves may develop persistent infection.
Due to the instability of the virus, indirect transmission
rarely occurs through farm workers, equipment and biting
flies. Although cattle are the primary hosts, the virus can
infect most even-toed ungulates. Interspecies spread of
bovine and ovine pestiviruses has been demonstrated under
natural conditions but its epidemiological significance is
uncertain.
1906
Pathogenesis
The virus is usually acquired by the oronasal route and
subsequent viraemia, virus spreads throughout the body
either free in the plasma or in association with leukocytes.
Both B and T lymphocyte numbers decrease. As the virus
hasan
 immunosuppressive
effect, infectionmay
predispose calves to respiratory and enteric disease. The
outcome of transplacental spread depends on the age of the
foetus at the time of infection. During the first 30 days of
gestation, infection may result in embryonic death with
return of the dam to oestrus. The effects of foetal infection
between 30 and 150 days of gestation include abortion,
mummification and congenital abnormalities of the CNS,
often cerebellar hypoplasia. Foetuses, which become
infected after day 120 of gestation, can mount an active
immune response and are usually normal at birth. If virus
invades the foetus before the development of immune
competence, immunotolerance to the agent develops with
persistent infection for the lifetime of the animal. The virus
involved in this persistent infection is non-cytopathic.
Later, usually between 6 months and 2 years of age, a
cytopathic biotype emerges as a consequence of mutation
of the non-cytopathic virus or of recombination with
nucleic acid of the host cell or other non-cytopathic
biotypes. The presence of cytopathic virus, which is
antigenically homologous to the resident non-cytopathic
biotype and is not cleared by the immune system, leads to
the development of widespread lesions and mucosal
disease. In some cases the source of the cytopathic virus
may be external, as occurs in vaccine-associated outbreaks.
If the superinfecting virus is antigenically heterologous, it
1907
will be cleared by the immune system but may give rise to
a new cytopathic mutant following recombination with the
resident non-cytopathic virus.
Cytopathic  isolates differ  from  their   non-cytopathic
counterparts by the continual production of an 80-kDa
non-structural protein (NS3), the result of cleavage of the
NS2-3 gene product. The role of NS3 in the pathogenesis
of mucosal disease is unclear, but cellular destruction by
cytopathic BVDV appears to be as a result of apoptosis.
The NS3 protein is also detectable in leukocytes and
several tissues  in cattle  persistentlyinfectedwith
non-cytopathic virus (Kameyama et al., 2008) and may
account for signs of reduced immuno-ompetence, poor
development and respiratory  signs observed  in some
persistently-infected animals. Cytopathic isolates have a
particular tropism for gut-associated lymphoid tissues.
Clinical signs
Most BVDV infections are subclinical. Outbreaks of BVD
are usually associated withhigh morbidity and low
mortality.  When  present,  clinical   signs  include
inappetence, depression, fever and diarrhoea. Significant
mortality has been described in some outbreaks of BVD
(David et al., 1 994). Peracute BVD is characterized by
high fever, severe diarrhoea and dehydration. Ulceration of
the oral mucous membrane and the epithelia of the
interdigital cleft and coronary band may also be present. In
some cases, thrombocytopenia results in bloody diarrhoea,
epistaxis and petechiae in the mouth, conjunctiva and
sclera
1908
Although a significant proportion of persistently- infected
animals are clinically normal, some are born undersized
and exhibit retarded
1 growthrate and poor viability.
Increased susceptibility to enteritis and pneumonia has
been reported. Mucosal disease is usually sporadic in
occurrence.  The  condition  affects  persistently-infected
animals, usually between 6 months and 2 years of age
Clinical signs include depression, fever, profuse watery
diarrhoea, nasal discharge, salivation and lameness.
Ulcerative lesions are present in the mouth and interdigital
clefts. Case fatality rate is 1o0%; death usually occurs
within weeks of the onset of clinical signs. A few animals
may survive for several months before dying from severe
debilitation.
Diagnosis
A tentative diagnosis may be possible on the basis of
clinical  signs  and pathological findings.  Laboratory
confirmation requires demonstration of antibody, viral
antigen or viral RNA. Seroconversion and the presence of
viraemic animals are necessary for confirmation of
established infection in a herd.
·Specimens suitable for laboratory examinations include
serum, spleen, tissue from the pinna (*'ear notch’ test), lymph
node and lesions from the gastrointestinal tract.
·Virus can be isolated in cell cultures. Sequential samples
taken 3 weeks apart should be used to confirm persistent
infection. Before foetal calf serum
is used in cell culture medium, it should be screened for the
 presence of virus or antibody.
  i      
immunoperoxidase   technique.
[mmunohistochemical
1909
staining of skin sections ('ear notch’ test) has been shown to
correlate well with results from blood- based tests (Njaa et
af.,2000)
· Dot blot, in situ hybridization and PCR techniques (Letellier
and Kerkhofs, 2003) for the detection of viral RNA have
been described. A multiplex PCR for the detection and
differentiation of BVDV 1 and BVDV 2 has been described
(Gilbert et al., 1999). Detection of viral nucleic acid in
pooled samples such as bulk milk (Drew et al., 1999) and
serum (Weinstock et al., 2001) is possible using RT- PCR
· Virus neutralization and ELISA are the most commonly used
methods for the detection of antibodies to BVDV.
Demonstration of a four-fold increase in antibody titre of
paired serum samples is necessary to confirm recent
infection. Most commercial ELISAs utilize the NS3 protein,
alone or in combination with other BVDV protein, as
pestiviruses. It has been shown that NS3-specific antibody
levels in serum and milk are low or undetectable following
vaccination with an inactivated BVDV vaccine and that it is
possible to monitor infection in vaccinated herds provided a
suitable vaccine and NS3 antibody test combination is
applied (Makoschey et al., 2007; Kuijk et al., 2008).
Treatment and control
Supportive therapy may be of benefit in outbreaks of
bovine viral diarrhoea. Most losses arising from BVDV
infections in herds result from the effects of prenatal
infections and mucosal disease. Control strategies are
directed at preventing infections which can lead to the
birth of persistently-infected animals.
·  Killed, attenuated live and  temperature-sensitive mutant
virus vaccines have been developed. Live vaccines induce
        
infections and immuno- suppression. In addition, they may
1910
animals. Killed vaccines primarily elicit a humoral immune
response and may be used in pregnant animals but require
regular boosters to maintain protection. The extent to which
killed vaccines protect the foetus is unclear. Vaccines
produced from a single strain or genotype of virus may not
be fully protective due to antigenic variation, a feature of
BVDV isolates. Vaccines have largely been evaluated for
their ability to prevent acute disease, and manufacturers
generally do not claim that vaccination prevents foetal
infection (van Campen and Woodard, 1997). Exposure of
replacement stock to a persistently-infected animal before
 p u m du  s 
but is less reliable than vaccination.
The elimination of BVDV from a herdrequires the
identification and removal of persistently-Infected animals.
The dam, sire and progeny of persistently- infected animals
should be tested since the virus can be passed from parent to
offspring.
·Based on successful control and eradication programmes
carried out in northern Europe, a two- step vaccination in
conjunction   with
test
 and
 removal
of
      
densities and high seroprevalence has been recommended
(Moennig et al., 2005). This involves inoculation with an
inactivated vaccine followed by administration of a modified
live vaccine 4 weeks later.
·Herd immunitywanes following the
removalof
persistently-infected animals. Therefore, all newly acquired
cattle should be tested before being introduced to the herd.
·Systematic testing of bulk milk or pooled blood samples for
antibodies from herds plays an important role in identifying
herds with persistently-infected animals and is important in
national eradication programmes.
Border disease
This congenital disorder of lambs, also known as hairy
shaker disease, occurs worldwide. Border disease, which
1911
was first reported from the Welsh/English border, is
caused by infection of the foetus with a non- cytopathic
pestivirus. Border disease virus (BDV) is closely related to
bovine viral diarrhoea virus and it has been suggested that
they may be a single species. Pestivirus isolates from
sheep can infect other domestic ruminants and pigs.
Moreover, pestivirus isolates from a number of domestic
species, particularly cattle, can infect pregnant sheep
causing border disease in their offspring
Epidemiology
Persistently-infected animals shed virus continuously in
excretions and secretions. These animals tend to have a
low survival rate under field conditions, although some
may survive for several years without developing clinical
signs.  Persistently-infected ewes may give birth  to
persistently- infected
1lambs.  Acute  infections in
susceptible sheep are transient and result in immunity to
challenge with homologous strains of
BDV. Infected rams shed virus in semen and may infect
transmission can occur through contaminated needles
during flock vaccination. Other ruminant species shedding
pestivirus are potential sources of infection for sheep
Pathogenesis
Virus is probably acquired by the oronasal route. In
susceptible pregnant ewes, infection results in placentitis
and invasion of the foetus. The immune response of the
ewe does not protect the developing foetus. The age of the
foetus at the time of infection ultimately determines the
1912
outcome. The foetus develops immune competence
between 60 and 85 days of gestation. Foetal death may
follow infection prior to the development of immune
competence, the outcome being resorption, abortion or
mummification.
Foetuses
which
survive
become
immunotolerant and remain persistently infected. These
animals may be clinically normal at birth or may display
tremors andhairy
ybirthcoat, consequences of viral
interference  with organogenesis.  Congenital  defects  in
affected lambs  include  skeletal
growth retardation,
hypomyelinogenesis and enlarged primary hair follicles
with reduced numbers of secondary follicles. Infection
after day 85 of gestation induces an immune response with
elimination of the virus and the birth of a healthy lamb.
Foetal infection during mid-gestation, when the immune
system is developing, may result in lesions in the central
nervoussystem including
cerebral  cavitation
1 and
cerebellar dysplasia. Immune-mediated reactions have
been suggested as the possible explanation for these severe
lesions. Some persistently-infected sheep may develop a
condition similar to mucosal disease of cattle. Cytopathic
isolates of BDV have been recovered from the intestines of
such affected animals
Clinical signs
In flocks infected with BDV, there may be an increase in
the number of abortions and weak neonatal lambs.
Characteristic signs of infection in newborn lambs include
altered body conformation, changes in fleece quality and
tremors. Hairs projecting above the wool, particularly
along the neck and back, impart a halo effect that is most
noticeable in fine-coated breeds. Affected lambs are often
1913
small and their survival rate is poor. The survival rate is
influenced not only by the severity of the neurological
dysfunction but also by the standard of animal care. In
well-nursed lambs, the neurological signs gradually abate
and such animals may eventually become clinically
normal.
Diagnosis
· The characteristic clinical signs are diagnostic
· Dysmyelination may be demonstrable histologically in the
central nervous system. Immunohistochemical staining can
be used to demonstrate virus in brain tissue.
·Virus isolation is possible in susceptible bovine or ovine cell
lines. Immunohistochemical staining is used to demonstrate
the presence of non-cytopathic virus.
Samples suitable for virus isolation include whole blood and
tissues from affected lambs. Pre-colostral blood from lambs
is preferable because antibody acquired from colostrum may
interfere with virus isolation.
·Viral antigen can be detected by immunofluorescent staining
of frozen sections or by immunoperoxidase staining of fixed
sections. An ELISA can be used to detect viral antigen in the
blood of persistently-infected lambs.
· Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction can be used
to detect viral RNA and to genotype the virus (Vilcek and
Paton, 2000; Willoughby et al., 2006).
· Serological testing, employing methods such as virus
neutralization and ELISA, can be used to determine the
extent of infection in a flock.
Control
Control should be based on identification and removal of
persistently-infected animals  and  precautions  to avoid
introduction of infected animals into a flock. Where such a
1914
policy is not feasible, breeding stock should be deliberately
mixed with persistently-infected animals at least 2 months
before mating.  A  commercial  inactivated,  adjuvanted
vaccine is available, containing BDV and BVDV-1
(Nettleton et al., 1998)
Classical swine fever (hog cholera)
This highly contagious, potentially fatal disease of pigs,
although still present in many countries, has been
eradicated from North America, Australia and most
European countries. It is classed as a listed (formerly List
A) disease by the Office International des Epizooties. In
recent years, sporadic outbreaks have occurred in the
United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands and
Germany. It is still enzootic in wild boar in some European
countries. Isolates of classical swine fever virus (CSFV),
the causal agent of the disease, can be placed in three
major groups on the basis of nucleotide sequence data
(Lowings et al., 1996;
Moennig et al., 2003). Recent European isolates, placed in
Group 2, are distinct from those that caused swine fever
outbreaks during the 1940s and 1950s (Group 1) and those
circulating in Asia (Group 3). Isolates, although
conforming to a single major antigenic type and being
mostly non-cytopathic, differ substantially in virulence.
Epidemiology
         
CSFV and direct contact between infected and susceptible
animals is the main means of transmission. In endemic
areas, the disease is spread principally by movement of
1915
infected pigs. Shedding of virus may begin before clinical
signs become evident. Virulent virus is shed in all
excretions and secretions until the time of death at about
20 days post infection. Virus strains of moderate virulence
may result in chronic infection with continuous or
intermittent  shedding by infected pigs.  In addition,
congenital infections with strains of low virulence may
result in the birth of persistently-infected piglets. Infected
animals occur in wild boar populations in Europe, which
act as reservoirs of infection leading to spread by direct
contact and indirectly by infected meat. Spread between
premises can occur indirectly, particularly in regions with
a high density of pig farms. Transmission can occur
mechanically  via personnel,   vehicles  and biting
arthropods. The virus, which is relatively fragile and does
not persist in the environment, is not spread over long
distances by air movement. Despite its lability, CSFV can
survive for long periods in protein-rich biological materials
such as meat or body fluids, particularly if chilled or
frozen. Although legislation prohibiting the feeding of
recent outbreaks of classical swine fever can still be traced
to waste food fed to pigs.
Pathogenesis and pathogenicity
Pigs are usually infected by the oronasal route. The tonsil
is the primary site of viral multiplication. Virus spreads to
regional lymph nodes and viraemia develops after further
viral multiplication. Virus, which has an affinity for
vascular endothelium and reticuloendothelial cells, can be
isolated from all major organs and tissues. In acute swine
fever, vascular damage in conjunction with severe
1916
thrombocytopenia    results   in    widespread
1 petechial
haemorrhages.  A non-  suppurative encephalitis with
prominentperivascularcuffing
is present in most
CSFV-infected pigs. Virus strains of reduced virulence can
cause a mild form of the disease. In pregnant sows, virus
may be transmitted to foetuses. The outcome of
transplacental infection is determined by the age of the
foetus and the virulence of the invading strain of virus.
Infection early in gestation results in foetal death with
resorption or abortion. In utero infection may also result in
stillbirths, weak newborn piglets with congenital tremors
and, occasionally, clinically normal piglets. Piglets with
immune tolerance to the virus remain persistently infected
and
dexcrete virus continuously.Persistently-infected
animals, which are clinically normal when born, may
subsequently develop late- onset disease following several
weeks or months of virtual absence of clinical signs. The
factors that precipitate late-onset disease are unclear.
Clinical signs
Following an incubation period of up to 10 days, affected
animals develop high fever and become inappetent and
     ii i sa
Vomiting and constipation are followed by diarrhoea.
Some animals may die soon after developing convulsions.
A swaying gait usually precedes posterior paresis. Most
cases of acute classical swine fever succumb within 20
days after infection.
Signs of disease are milder in infections caused by strains
of low virulence. Partial recovery from an initial phase of
acute illness may be followed by relapse and death. Some
1917
pigs may survive for several months but exhibit marked
growth  retardation.  Abortion, 
mummification,
malformations and stillbirths may be encountered in
breeding herds. Liveborm infected piglets, often exhibiting
tremors, may die soon after birth. Some affected piglets
may present with haemorrhages in the skin. Congenital
malformations include deformities of the head and limbs
and cerebellar hypoplasia.
Diagnosis
Although clinical signs and history may provide evidence
for a tentative diagnosis, laboratory confirmation is
essential, particularly with infections caused by strains of
reduced virulence.
· In acute disease, haemorrhages are present in many internal
organs and on serosal surfaces. Petechiae are often present
on kidney surfaces and in lymph nodes. Other gross
pathological features of diagnostic significance are splenic
infarction and *button’ ulcers in the mucosa of the terminal
ileum near the ileocaecal valve.
·Rapid
1  confirmation  is 
possible  using
direct
immunofluorescence on frozen sections of tonsillar tissue,
kidney, spleen, distal ileum and lymph nodes. As
pigs can be infected with BVDV, monoclonal antibodies
specific for CSFV may be required to reach a definitive
diagnosis.  Antigen-capture
ELISAs  are  available
commercially and are suitable for detection of viral antigen
in blood or organ suspensions. These assays are less
sensitive than virus isolation and are best used on a herd
basis.
·Virus isolation can be carried out in porcine cell lines using
homogenates of spleen and tonsil. As most isolates are
non-cytopathic, immunostaining
isnecessaryforthe
demonstration of viral antigen.
1918
· The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays
for detection of CSFV RNA are sensitive and rapid (Dewulf
et al., 2004 ; Hoffmann et al., 2005). They are now replacing
most other methods used for virus detection.
·Serological testing is useful on farms infected with strains of
low virulence or for serological surveys. Virus neutralization
and ELISA are the tests most widely used. A blocking
ELISA has been developed for distinguishing CSFV from
BVDV (Wensvoort et al., 1988) but the definitive method
for differentiation is the comparative neutralization test,
which compares the level of antibodies to the different
Pestivirus species.
Control
·The disease is notifiable in many countries which have
adopted slaughter policies and banned vaccination. Pigs and
pig products should not be imported from countries where
infection with CSFV is present. Swill must be boiled before
being fed to pigs. Contact between domesticated pigs and
wild pigs/boars should be avoided.
· In countries where the disease is endemic or during the early
stages of an eradication programme, vaccination may be
used. Live vaccines attenuated either by serial passage in
rabbits (Chinese strain) or in tissue culture (Japanese
guinea-pig strain or French Thiverval strain) are currently
used. These vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccinated
animals
 cannot be distinguished

naturally-infected animals. The use of recombinant E2

ELISA capable of detecting antibodies to the envelope

Togaviridae
Viruses in the family Togaviridae (Latin toga, cloak) are
enveloped RNA viruses, approximately 70 nm in diameter,
with icosahedral symmetry. The envelope, which contains
glycoprotein spikes, is closely bound to an icosahedral
capsid (Fig. 82.1). Togaviruses agglutinate goose and
chick erythrocytes. There are two genera, Alphavirus and
Rubivirus, in the family. The sole member of the genus
Rubivirus is rubella virus, which does not require an
arthropod vector and causes German measles in children
and young adults.
The genus Alphavirus includes more than 25 species, a
number of which are important animal pathogens.
Alphaviruses are divided, on the basis of genomic
composition, into a number of antigenically-related groups
including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)
complex, eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV)
complex, Semliki forest virus complex and western equine
encephalitis virus (WEEV) complex. Western equine
encephalitis virus has been shown to have arisen by
recombination between EEEV and Sindbis-like viruses,
probably between 1,300 and 1,900 years ago (Weaver et
al.,  1997).  Recombination  is infrequent  among
alphaviruses as these viruses undergo genetic change
primarily by accumulation of point mutations.
Replication of alphaviruses, which contain positivesense
single-stranded RNA, occurs in the cytoplasm, and
1926
nucleocapsids are assembled in the cytosol. In vertebrates.
alphavirus infection results in cytolysis. The viral
envelope, which  contains 
virus-derivedglycoprotein
spikes, is acquired as the nucleocapsid buds into the
plasma membrane. Viral infection of invertebrate cells is
usually non-cytolytic and is persistent. In this instance,
membranes rather than through the plasma membrane.
Key points

symmetry
·  Replicate in cell cytoplasm
· Labile in the environment
·Genus Alphavirus

encephalitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis
- major cause of zoonotic infections
Mature virions of alphaviruses are sensitive to pH changes,
heat, organic solvents, detergents and disinfectants and are
not stable in the environment. Alphaviruses, in common
with certain members of the Flaviviridae, Reoviridae,
Rhabdoviridae and Bunyaviridae, are termed arboviruses
indicating that they are arthropod-borne. This term,
however,  does not have taxonomic significance.
Alphaviruses  primarily  infect  and  are  transmitted  by
1927
mosquito species. Although they are capable of infecting a
variety of vertebrate hosts, they usually have a principal
invertebrate vector and an amplifying or reservoir
      
determine the geographical distribution of alphaviruses.
Clinical infections
Domestic animals and humans are usually considered to be
‘dead-end’ hosts of alphaviruses because they do not
develop a sufficiently high titre of circulating virus to act
as reservoir hosts. A number of important equine diseases
are caused by infection with members of the genus
Alphavirus (Table 82.1). The three equine encephalitis
viruses (Venezuelan, eastern and western), which are
confined to the western hemisphere, are transmitted by
mosquitoes. Getah virus occurs mainly in south-east Asia
and in Australia. A number of outbreaks of disease caused
by this virus have been recorded in Japan. The recent
addition of alphaviruses that infect fish, salmon pancreas
disease virus (SPDV), and elephant seals, southern
elephant seal virus, has added to the complexity of the
organization of the genus. It is considered unlikely that
SPDV is transmitted by an arthropod vector.

Equine encephalitides
The viruses that cause Venezuelan, eastern and western
encephalitis are important in the Americas. These three
viruses produce similar clinical signs although infections
caused by the virus of western equine encephalitis tend to
be mild. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is
considered the most important of the three viruses with
major disease outbreaks occurring at approximately 10 to
20-year intervals in South America.
Epidemiology
The
equine
encephalitidess
 share
some
common
epidemiological features. The peak periods of these
diseases coincide with times of maximum vector numbers,
1929
usually in late summer following heavy rainfall. The
regional distribution of the viruses is related to that of
mosquito  vectors.  Numbers  of  clinical  cases drop
dramatically when vector numbers decrease due to cold
weather or drought.
Eastern equine
 encephalitis
virus(EEEV)occurs
principally in Atlantic coastal areas of North America.
However, EEEV has also been isolated in Michigan, the
Caribbean islands and South America. Antigenic and
genetic differences exist between isolates from North and
South America indicating two distinct lineages. North
American isolates are highly conserved (Group I). In
contrast, South American isolates comprise several
genotypes, and at least three different subgroups (Groups
HIa, IIB, III) can be delineated. South American EEEV
infections are associated with equine disease but rarely
human disease. Accordingly, these viruses are considered
to be less virulent than North American isolates. The virus
is maintained in cycles of infection involving passerine
birds and the irrigation ditch
1mosquito (Culiseta
melanura), which inhabits freshwater swamps and is
ormithophilic (Fig. 82.2). Following infection, a high titre
of virus develops in many wild birds without evidence of
disease. High mortality rates have, however, been recorded
in pheasants, emus and whooping cranes. Virus can be
transmittedbetween
pheasants
bypecking
 and
cannibalism. Periodic epidemic outbreaks of infection in
wild birds, which may lead to infection of humans and
horses, involve additional mosquito species such as Aedes
on birds and on mammals. Infection usually results in
sporadic disease in humans, horses and pheasants.
1930
Epizootics, which tend to occur in the autumn, disappear
witht
the arrival of the first frosts. Overwintering
mechanisms for virus maintenance are unclear, although
wild birds are considered to be possible reservoirs.
Transovarial transmission  in mosquitoes has not been
demonstrated.

Isolates of VEEV comprise a complex of six subtypes (I to
VI). Within subtype I, there are five antigenic variants or
serotypes (AB-F). Originally, subtypes I-A and I-B were
considered to be distinct, but they are now believed to be
identical (I-AB). Epizootic forms of Venezuelan equine
encephalitis are caused by two highly virulent subtype I
serotypes of the virus (I-AB and I-C). The serotypes I-D,
I-E and I-F, as well as the other five subtypes (II to VI) of
VEEV, comprise enzootic viruses and are considered to be
non-pathogenic for Equidae. However, enzootic I-E
viruses have been shown to be responsible for a small
number of limited outbreaks of neurological disease in
         
viraemia produced by these enzootic strains in horses is
generally low. The viruses are maintained in sylvatic
cycles involving rodents and mosquitoes (Culex species) in
swampy habitats. Phylogenetic studies suggest that the
viruses implicated in epizootics are derived from mutation
of viruses involved in enzootic cycles (Weaver et al.,
1992), giving rise to increased infectivity for other
mosquito vector species and/or an increased level of
1932
viraemia in horses. Eguidae serve as amplifying hosts for
these epizootic strains. Genetic studies indicate a close
relationship between I-AB, I-C and I-D viruses. Epizootics
of VEE occurred regularly between 1962 and 1972 in the
northern part of South America and in Central America,
extending at one stage as far as Texas. Some of these
outbreaks resulted from residual live virus contained in
formalinized vaccine preparations. Following a quiescent
period of 20 years, a limited outbreak of disease occurred
in Venezuela in 1992 followed by an extensive epizootic in
Venezuela and Columbia in 1995 (Weaver et al., 1996).
Horses inoculated with a virulent subtype of VEEV are
important amplifiers of virus activity, developing a
viraemia of sufficiently high titre to allow transmission by
feeding mosquitoes.
Although
western equine encephalitis (WEE)has
traditionally occurred in the USA west of the Mississippi,
it is also present in many other parts of the North
American continent. Infections tend to recur
in certain areas. The cycle of infection involves
mosquitoes, usually Culex tarsalis, and indigenous wild
birds in which infection is inapparent. Horses are infected
incidentally and are ‘dead-end’ hosts because levels of
virus in the blood remain low. Epizootics are rare and
epizootic  strains probably arise from nonpathogenic
enzootic strains. Overwintering mechanisms of the virus
are unclear but may involve birds, reptiles or mosquitoes.
Highlands J virus is a closely related virus that belongs to
the WEEV complex and is found in the eastern United
States. It is a rare cause of encephalitis in horses but an
important pathogen of a number of bird species such as
emus and turkeys.
1933
Pathogenesis
Following
ginoculation by a feeding mosquito, viral
replication occurs near the site of entry and in the regional
lymph nodes. Viraemia, ranging from barely detectable to
high levels, is accompanied by fever. When disease is
severe, the virus invades the central nervous system
resulting in neuronal necrosis and perivascular lymphoid
cuffing.
Clinical signs
Diseases caused by the three equine encephalitis viruses
are clinically similar. The incubation period may be up to 9
days. Clinical signs, which usually last from 4 to 9 days,
range from mild fever and depression to fatal febrile
encephalomyelitis.
Neurological
 signs
include
photophobia, blindness, head pressing, circling, ataxia and
inability to swallow. Affected horses exhibit severe
depression with low carriage of the head and a wide-based
stance. Terminally, animals become recumbent and
semicomatose with convulsions prior to death. The case
fatality rate is 90% for EEE, 50 to 80% for VEE and 20 to
40%for WEE.
Diagnosis
Clinical signs along with a history of previous cases of
equine encephalitis in the same region may be suggestive
of the disease. However, laboratory confirmation is usually
required. Due to the possibility of human infection, care
must be taken during specimen collection.
1934
·Virus isolation provides a definitive diagnosis. Isolation is
carried out in cell culture or in suckling mice. Whole blood
or serum, collected during the pyrexic phase of the disease,
is suitable for virus isolation. Brain or cerebrospinal fluid
can be collected post mortem. When VEE is suspected,
isolates should be typed using monoclonal antibodies or
nucleic acid sequencing in order to distinguish virulent from
non-virulent subtypes.
·An immunohistochemical staining
  technique 
 forthe
detection of EEEV antigen in fixed brain sections has been
described (Patterson et al., 1996).
Detection of viral RNA in tissues of affected animals and in
mosquitoes can be achieved using RT-PCR (Pfeffer et af.,
1997; Linssen et af., 2000).
Diagnosis of WEE or EEE is usually based on serology.
Paired serum samples should be collected to demonstrate a
rising titre. Suitable testing methods include ELISA, plaque
reduction neutralization assay, haemagglutination-inhibition
and complement fixation. An IgM capture ELISA has been
used to provide evidence of infection in single serum
samples. The vaccination status of an animal must be
considered in interpreting the results of serological tests. The
interpretation of serological results for VEEV is complicated
by the presence of antibodies produced in response to
inapparent infections with non-virulent subtypes.
Treatment and control
Although    supportive  palliative    treatments   may  be
beneficial, the prognosis is generally poor. Control is
based on vaccination of horses and implementation of
measures aimed at reducing mosquito populations

Prions: unconventional infectious agents
The microbial pathogens responsible for the majority of
infectious    diseases
in   mammals 
conformto
longestablished criteria used to describe infectious agents.
These criteria include their size, morphology, biochemical
characteristics, mode of replication and their susceptibility
to physical and chemical methods of inactivation. The
realization that some infectious agents did not conform to
this system of evaluation was initially treated with
scepticism by many scientists. Gradually it became evident
that a particular group of infectious agents, termed
unconventional infectious agents, had attributes which set
them apart from typical microbial pathogens such as
viruses,  bacteria  and  fungi.  These  unconventional
infectious agents appear to be devoid of nucleic acid, can
infect animals and humans without inducing an immune
response and exhibit resistance to physical and chemical
methods of inactivation far beyond the most resistant
forms of conventional infectious agents. The diseases in
which unconventional infectious agents are implicated are
termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs),
a
unique
group
of
neurodegenerative
diseases
characterized by neuronal degeneration. A proposal that
the agents responsible for TSEs be grouped together as
distinctly  different  infectious  agents  gradually  gained
   sa     
scientific literature (Prusiner, 1982). Two types of prions
are described, one associated with mammals, the other
with fungi (Wickner, 1994). The ^prion theory’ proposes
1938
that this unique group of infectious agents are derived from
       
number of different biological mechanisms (Prusiner et al.,
1999). As a consequence of these alterations, it is
suggested that prions can induce changes in the animal's
body which lead to the development of TSEs. The native
glycoprotein, PrP (host cellular prion protein), which is
highly conserved across most species, is composed of 252
to 264 amino acids and is proteinase K-sensitive and
detergent-soluble (Wopfner et al., 1999). The C-terminal
half of the molecule comprises
two short β-sheets and three longer c-helices. The first 23
amino acids of the N terminus of PrPC act as a signal
peptide that targets the protein to the cell membrane where
the  C  terminus  becomes

the brains of animals with TSEs. These experiments
demonstrate that binding of several β-PrP molecules

together can lead to the formation of an irreversible β-sheet
accumulationin
TSEs.
The formation of PrpSc from PrPC in TSEs may be
usually by ingestion such as occurred in cases of kuru
following ritualistic cannibalism in the Fore peoples of
Papua New Guinea (Fig. 83.2)._ Random spontaneous
sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), may initiate the
process in an individual. This is the most common form of
human prion disease accounting for approximately 70 to
80% of all cases with an incidence of one per million of
the population. A third mechanism relates to mutation in
the PrP gene which predisposes to configurational change
in PrPC as occurs in the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
syndrome in humans.

The PrP gene of an infected animal determines the
primary amino acid sequence of the prion protein in that
animal. The resistance of some species to infection by
barrier'. This barrier is attributed to differences between
the amino acid sequences of the prion proteins in the two
species. According to the conformational selection model,
the host PrPC
 primary structure influences its degree of
type and the ease of
transmission between species is determined by the degree
of overlap between the PrPSc 
 types permitted by the PrPC
present in the host and donor species (Collinge and Clarke,
1944
2007). On initial transfer of PrpSc between species, the
incubation period tends to be relatively long. Subsequent
transfer between members of the recipient species leads to
barrier’ may explain the resistance of humans to infection
with PrpSc derived from sheep with scrapie. The prion
strain responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) is considered to be highly ‘promiscuous’ and may
conformation that is readily imprinted on PrPC from a
range of different species.
Infectious TSE isolates which, following inoculation of
syngeneic hosts, cause disease with distinct characteristics
and exhibit distinct prion-disease phenotypes, are defined
as prion strains (Aguzzi et al., 2007). Prion strains from
infected sheep have been described on the basis of
bioassays in mice. Strain differentiation is based on
incubation periods, mortality patterns, PrpSc deposition
patterns, lesion profiles, proteinase K sensitivity and
titratable infectivity in the brains of mice of known
genotypes. Prion diversity is thought to be determined by
may account for observed differences in prion strains. The
protein only' theory of prion composition is contested
(Chesebro, 1998) and the existence of strains has been
cited as evidence which supports a requirement for the
presence of nucleic acid in prions.
Prions are stable at a wide pH range and are remarkably
resistant to most methods of biological inactivation. Early
evidence of the resistance of these agents to chemical
inactivation was provided by retrospective studies on
1945
18,0o0 sheep, which had been inadvertently exposed to
infection when inoculated with a formalized louping ill
vaccine. The vaccine at that time was prepared from
brains, spinal cords and spleens of sheep. It also contained
    s   n 
with formaldehyde (Greig, 1950). Approximately 10% of
the vaccinated animals developed scrapie. Treatment of
prions with alcohols and aldehydes that fix proteins may
help to stabilize rather than inactivate these agents. The
inclusion of a formic acid step in formaldehyde fixation of
brain tissue is used to reduce the infectivity of the agents
of scrapie, BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease in
histological sections. Physical methods for inactivating the
agents of BSE and scrapie have been intensively
investigated because safe disposal of infected carcasses is
mandatory. Although autoclaving at 132°C has been
recommended, it does not ensure prion inactivation. High
concentrations of sodium hypochlorite or hot solutions of
sodium hydroxide have been shown to inactivate a
thermostable strain of scrapie agent (Taylor, 2000).
Clinical infections
Diseases attributed to prions occur sporadically and are
significantly influenced by the genome of the affected
animal. They are viewed as part of a diverse group of
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease
and Parkinson's disease in humans, referred to as
protein-folding diseases'. These diseases share a number
of features in common including appearance late in life,
neuronal loss and the accumulation of cerebral deposits of
misfolded protein aggregates (Soto and Estrada, 2008).
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are slowly
1946
progressive  neurodegenerative  diseases,  which
)are
characterized by long incubation periods and spongiform
changes in the brain. They have been described in many
animal species, including ruminants and certain carnivores
(Table 83.1). Similarities in the neuropathological features
of scrapie in sheep and kuru in humans suggested that the
two diseases had a similar aetiology (Hadlow, 1959).
Subsequently, it was established that kuru was also caused
by an unconventional transmissible agent. A number of
other similar neurodegenerative diseases of humans, some
of which are genetically determined, are classified as
TSEs. The TSEs that have been described in humans are
presented in Table 83.2. In humans, these TSEs may occur
as infectious, genetic or sporadic diseases. In scrapie, there
is convincing evidence for the importance of the genetic
constitution of certain breeds of sheep in determining
susceptibility to the disease.

goats and moufflon occurs worldwide except in Australia
and New Zealand.
Epidemiology
The mode of transmission of scrapie is not clearly
understood but epidemics are self-sustaining due to
horizontal transmission and environmental persistence.
Potential modes for natural infection include ingestion,
entry through superficial abrasions and transmission from
ewe to lamb. There is evidence that transmission tends to
occur during early life and that exposure to placental
material and milk from affected ewes may be important
(Konold et al., 2008). Pastures grazed by affected animals
appear to remain contaminated for years.
Particular polymorphisms of the PrP gene are associated
with an increased incidence of scrapie in certain breeds of
sheep. Some research workers have inferred from breeding
experiments that scrapie is an exclusively genetic disease.
However, Australia and New Zealand are free of scrapie
despite the presence of animals with scrapie-associated PrP
alleles (Hunter et al., 1997). The PrP gene-coding
sequence in sheep is highly polymorphic. Polymorphisms
at codons 136, 154 and 171 of the PrP gene, producing
amino acid substitutions in PrP protein, are important in
influencing susceptibility to scrapie. In many breeds, the
1949
valine 136 glutamine 171 arginine 154 (denoted VRQ)
allele is strongly associated with susceptibility to scrapie
(Laplanche et al., 1999). An atypical form of scrapie,
Nor98, which has a different tissue distribution and can
occur in animals genetically resistant to classical scrapie,
has been described in Europe and the United States
(Benestad et al., 2003)
Pathogenesis
Following natural infection, PrpSc is usually first detected
in tissues of the lymphoreticular system including the
spleen, the palatine tonsil and the retropharyngeal and
mesenteric lymph nodes. In lymph nodes, replication
apparently occurs in follicular dendritic cells. After oral
exposure it is thought that the portal of entry to neural
tissues is in the duodenum and ileum. The agent then
spreads through fibres of the autonomic nervous system to
the spinal cord and the medulla oblongata (van Keulen et
al., 2008). Neuronal and neuropil vacuolation and
astrogliosis are characteristic features of this disease.
Clinical signs
The disease has a long incubation period. Neurological
signs develop predominantly in sheep of breeding age with
a peak incidence between 3 and 4 years of age. Initially,
affected animals may present with restlessness or
nervousness, particularly after sudden noise or movement.
Fine tremors of the head and neck and incoordination with
a tendency to exhibit jerky movements are characteristic
signs. Pruritus may result in loss of wool. In some affected
sheep, a nibbling reflex can be elicited by scratching the
1950
back. Progression of the disease leads to emaciation. Death
usually occurs within 6 months from the onset of clinical
signs. The annual mortality rate due to scrapie in an
affected flock is typically 3 to 5% although the rate can
reach 20% in severely affected flocks
Diagnosis
Clinical  signs and histopathological examination of the
CNS form the basis for diagnosis. Characteristic
microscopic changes  include  neuronal  vacuolation  and
degeneration, vacuolar change in the neuropil, and
astrocytosis,  particularly
in the medulla.  However,
additional samples of all major brain regions may need to
be processed given that strain-specific targeting of other
parts of the brain has been described (Benestad et al.,
2003). No obvious inflammatory response is evident.
Confirmatory   methods
include immunohistochemical
staining
for
immunoblotting to  detect
proteinase-K-resistant PrPSc and electron microscopy to
detect  scrapie-associated   fibrils   in    detergent-treated
extracts of brain. Ante-mortem detection methods, based
palatine tonsil, nictitating membrane and rectal biopsies by
histochemical methods, have being reported but do not
detect prions in all infected sheep. A number of rapid
immunodiagnostic tests based on western blot methods or
ELISA methodology, originally developed for BSE, are
now available for the diagnosis of scrapie (Novakofski et
al., 2005). Positive or inconclusive results require
confirmation by  immunohistochemistry or  western blot
methods.  Serology  is  not  useful diagnostically   as
1951
antibodies specific for the scrapie agent that do not
cross-react with PrP' have not been demonstrated.
Control
In the European Union, scrapie has been designated a
notifiable disease. Countries free of the disease impose
strict quarantine procedures. Slaughter policies have been
enforced with different degrees of success in
several countries. In Australia and New Zealand, an
eradication policy, implemented soon after the introduction
of the disease, was successful. Eradication was abandoned
in the United States because of the cost and difficulties in
implementation.  A  control policy involving flock
certification and movement restrictions is now in place.
Breeding scrapie-resistant sheep may be a realistic method
for reducing the frequency of the disease (Parry, 1983).
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy
This condition is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease
of adult cattle, first recognized in England in 1986 (Wells
et al., 1987). More than 180,000 cases of the disease were
subsequently confirmed and an estimated one million
animals were infected. This common source epidemic
peakedin 1992 when more than36,000 cases were
identified. Since then, there has been a steady decline in
numbers of confirmed cases. The disease has been reported
in several countries in animals imported from Great
Britain. In addition, indigenous cattle in many European
countries, including Switzerland, Ireland, France and
Portugal, have developed the disease. Cases of BSE in
1952
indigenous cattle have also been reported in Canada, USA,
Israel and Japan
Theprion
strain
causing
 bovine  spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE)  is  not
t considered to be
species-specific; infection has been reported in exotic
ungulates in zoological collections following ingestion of
feed derived from contaminated bovine tissues. In
addition, feline spongiform encephalopathy was first
recorded in the early 1990s in association with the BSE
epidemic. In 1996, a novel form of human prion disease
termed variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)was
recognized in Great Britain. Molecular strain-typing
studies and experimental transmission in transgenic and
conventional mice indicated that vCJD and BSE are
caused by indistinguishable prion strains. The extent of
exposure of the human population to the agent cannot be
accurately estimated because of uncertainties about risk
factors and about the length of the incubation period in
vCJD (Collinge, 1999). Susceptibility to vCJD is strongly
associated with a methionine homozygous genotype at
codon 129 of the human prion protein (PRNP) gene. The
number of deaths due to vCJD peaked in the United
Kingdom in 2000 at 28 cases, while the total number of
deaths caused by vCJD reached 170 in 2010.
The BSE epidemic in Great Britain is considered to have
been caused by a single major strain of BSE. However,
following large-scale active surveillance studies in several
countries, atypical forms of BSE have been identified
based on variant features of pathology and/or molecular
characteristics. One type ('H-type') is characterized by
higher molecular mass fragments than classical BSE, while
1953
the other has a lower molecular mass and is referred to as
L-type'
bovine
amyloidotic
spongiform
encephalopathy (BASE). The discovery of atypical forms
of BSE suggests that this neurodegenerative disease may
sometimes arise spontaneously and, accordingly, sporadic
cases will continue to occur.
Epidemiology
The BSE epidemic, which started simultaneously at
several geographical locations in Great Britain, was
attributed to contaminated meat-and-bone meal (MBM)
prepared from slaughterhouse offal and fed as a protein
dietary supplement to cattle. It is postulated that the
scrapie agent crossed the species barrier into cattle in the
early 1980s following changes in the rendering process
which allowed survival of increased amounts of scrapie
PrP (PrpSc) in the MBM. Recycling of infected tissues
from animals with BSE, prior to the recognition of the
disease and the imposition of control measures, resulted in
extension of the epidemic. Because of the high ratio of
sheep to cattle, the frequency of endemic scrapie and the
heavy reliance on MBM as a supplement for dairy cattle in
Great Britain, the epidemic has been largely confined to
that country (Nathanson et al., 1999). However, MBM was
exported from the UK during the early part of the epidemic
and the subsequent introduction of rapid testing across
        o
countries. As a result of the banning of ruminantderived
MBM in 1988, there was a marked decline in the
prevalence of BSE in Great Britain after 1993. Despite this
decline, animals born after imposition of the ban have
developed BSE. This was ascribed to the continued use of
1954
ruminant-derived MBM and also to cross-contamination in
feed mills by rations specified for pigs and poultry.
Additional stringent regulations, introduced in 1996,
banned the inclusion of mammalian-derived MBM from
farm animal feed.
Horizontal transmission of BSE does not appear to occur
and, although maternal transmission may occur at a low
rate, it is considered to be of minimal importance in the
spread of disease. Susceptibility of cattle to BSE appears
to be independent of sex, breed and genotype.
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of BSE is poorly defined. The agent of
BSE has been found in the distal ileum following
experimental oral exposure. In naturally occurring cases of
the disease, the agent has been demonstrated mainly in the
CNS, retina and distal ileum. Characteristic changes in the
CNS include vacuolation and glial proliferation.
Clinical signs
The mean incubation period is about 5 years. Neurological
signs, which are highly variable, include changes in
behaviour and deficits in posture and movement. Loss of
weight and decreased milk production also occur. Other
clinical   signs   include   tremors,
hyperaesthesia,
apprehension, bruxism, exaggerated menace reflex and
head shyness. Ataxia, hypermetria and a tendency to fall
        
disease. The clinical course may extend over many days or
months.
1955
Diagnosis
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy can be confirmed by
histopathological
1examination  of brain tissue  and
appropriate additional methods.  Examination of brain
tissue may be confined to a coronal section of the medulla
at the obex. Characteristic neuropathological changes
including  neuropil   vacuolation   and   astrocytosis  are
consistently present at this site. Additional confirmatory
immunoblotting  to demonstrate  proteinase  K resistant
detergent-treated extracts of brain. Commercial, automated
immunoblotting and ELISA techniques suitable for
large-scale screening of animals are now available
(Novakofski et al., 2005). The application of protein
misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technology to
2001; Soto et al., 2005) may enhance detection and lead to
the development of more sensitive assays for the testing of
presymptomatic animals and humans.
Control
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a notifiable disease
in countries of the European Union with compulsory
testing of fallen animals and cattle over 48 months of age.
In some countries, the entire herd in which an affected
animal is detected is slaughtered. In other countries,
clinically-affected animals only, or affected and cohort
animals, are slaughtered. Ruminant-derived protein should
be excluded from ruminant rations. Carcasses of infected
animals should be incinerated at high temperatures to
1956
ensure destruction of the thermostable agent. Buildings
and equipment can be decontaminated by the application
of high concentrations of sodium hypochlorite or of heated
strong solutions of sodium hydroxide (Taylor, 2000).
Tissues considered to have a high risk of transmitting BSE
such as skull, spinal column, tonsils, intestines and
mesentery are excluded from the human food chain in
many countries.

primary viral infection may lead to a secondary bacterial
infection are illustrated by the secondary invasion of
damaged  canine   intestinal   tissue  by  Gram-negative
bacteria following canine parvovirus  infection of the
intestinal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes. Sudden
dietary changes that alter the microflora of young animals,
colonization by Gram- negative bacteria, such as E. coli,
which are capable of producing local tissue damage and
systemic disease. Gram-positive bacteria,  such as
enteropathogenic clostridia, can also produce serious
enteric disease when circumstances such as a high intake
of grain or unrestricted access to rich pasture promote their
rapid proliferation with subsequent toxin production.
Diseases caused by Gram-positive bacteria include fatal
septicaemia in ruminants and other domestic animals
caused by Bacillus anthracis, potentially fatal intoxication
caused by neurotoxic clostridia, suppurative conditions
associated with staphylococcal infections, and both
localized and disseminated lesions caused by bacteria
belonging to the Actinobacteria (Fig. 84.1). Pathogenic
mycobacteria, which produce chronic progressive diseases
humans and
animals,  although(
cytochemically
Gram-positive, stain poorly using the Gram stain. The
Ziehl-Neelsenstaining
 method 1s
employed
for
demonstrating these acid-fast bacteria in smears.
Gram-positive bacteria exhibit wide diversity in their
cultural characteristics, their host preferences, their ability
to produce disease and their responses to chemotherapeutic
agents.  Staphylococcus   species   are    of   particular
importance because of the range of virulence factors that
1965
they express and their ability to develop resistance to
antibacterial   drugs.  Resistance   of   staphylococci  to
antibiotics is a major obstacle to the successful treatment
of tissue infections in many species. Because pathogenic
clostridia produce potent exotoxins which are responsible
for
tissue  damage, neurological  disturbance and
enterotoxaemia, toxoids are highly effective vaccines for
preventing clostridial diseases. Vaccination, however, is
not an effective option at present for inducing protective
immunity against  infections  caused  by  staphylococci,
streptococci, listeria, corynebacteria or actinomycetes. The
diverse natures of the diseases that these Gram- positive
bacteria produce in animals, due to the virulence factors
that they elaborate and the absence of a sustained
protective immune response following infection, are
among the reasons why the development of effective safe
vaccines for these important pathogens has not yet been
successful. Although there has been some progress in the
development of vaccines for pathogenic mycobacteria, the
failure to clearly identify toxic factors produced by these
intracellular bacteria and the chronic nature of the diseases
they produce account for some of the difficulties in
explaining the pathogenesis of these acid-fast bacteria and
the limitations of vaccination  for the prevention of
mycobacterial diseases.

1967
αerogenes are two opportunistic bacterial species often
encountered in coliform mastitis in dairy cattle. Proteus
species  and  Klebsiella  species  cause urinary  tract
infections in dogs, cats and other animals. Salmonella
serotypes cause enteric disease in most species of animals,
septicaemia in calves, foals and piglets and food-
poisoning in humans. Serotypes vary in virulence and a
number are adapted to particular hosts.
Enteric disease, septicaemia and toxaemia are conditions
associated with E. coli infections in young animals.
Brucella species, major intracellular pathogens, target the
reproductive tract of sexually mature female and male
animals. Abortion in late gestation is a feature of
brucellosis in ruminants and pigs. Apart from the diseases
produced in animals, many Brucella species cause severe
systemic disease in humans characterized by intermittent
fever of variable duration, profuse sweating and weight
loss. Among the Gram- negative bacteria, spirochaetes are
important human and
animal
pathogens.Leptospira
interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae is an example of
a leptospire which produces septicaemia in young animals,
abortions in cattle and serious human infection. Another
spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, causes Lyme
borreliosis in dogs, other domestic animals and humans.
Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, an anaerobic spirochaete,
causes swine dysentery, a disease of weaned pigs which
results in poor food conversion and economic loss. A brief
summary  of   the    characteristics    of   pathogenic
Gram-negative bacteria, including the diseases that they
cause, is presented in Fig. 84.2.

Atypical bacteria  constitute  a distinct grouping of
microorganisms that do not conform to the convenient
differentiationof
 bacteria  into   Gram-positive    and
Gram-negative categories based on their cell wall staining
is wide divergence in their structure, staining patterns,
growth requirements and pathogenicity. The mycoplasmas
do not have cell walls, are highly pleomorphic and do not
stain by the Gram method. In addition, a number of
mycoplasmal organisms, formerly described as rickettsiae
and now referred to as haemotropic mycoplasmas, do not
grow in vitro; many of these unusual mycoplasmas are
probablyarthropod-borne
and
they  cause infectious
anaemia in many
mammalian
1species. Mycoplasmal
pathogens cause respiratory diseases in ruminants, pigs
and poultry; these pathogens also cause mastitis and
arthritis in ruminants
Sinmanycountries.Contagious
bovine pleuropneumonia is endemic in parts of Africa, the
Middle
East
and
Asia.
Contagious
caprine
pleuropneumonia is present in northern and eastern Africa
and in Turkey, while enzootic pneumonia of pigs occurs
worldwide. Mycoplasmal diseases are of major economic
importance not only in developing countries but also in
regions of the world where ruminants, pigs and poultry are
reared intensively. Coxiella burnetii, which occurs in two
antigenic phases, is often transmitted by aerosols. This
organism, which is unusually stable in the environment
and resistant to disinfectants, produces an influenza-like
occupational disease in farmers and abattoir workers but
most infections in animals are subclinical. The obligate
intracellular bacteria,  chlamydiae, have  a unique
developmental cycle and produce respiratory, enteric and

4naplasma species do not grow on inert media, are
tick-borne and produce diseases in ruminants, horses,
humans and dogs. Ehrlichia species infect ruminants, dogs
and

countries.These tick-borne
pathogens replicate in granulocytes, monocytes and
macrophages; endothelial cells are the targets of E.
ruminantium and E.ondiri.Rickettsia rickettsii causes
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a tickborne infection.
Humans, dogs and rodents are susceptible to this rickettsial
disease. Vascular endothelial damage is a prominent
feature of the disease in humans and in animals. A brief

Dermatophytoses, which are clinically more important
than dermatomycoses because of their communicability to
are associated with the invasion and destruction
of
keratinized   structures   by   dermatophytes  such
as
Microsporum and  Trichophyton  species. Subcutaneous
mycoses usually result from localized fungal invasion of
the dermis and subcutis, often a consequence of
penetration by a foreign body. Systemic mycoses, which
often originate in the respiratory or digestive tracts, usually
followopportunistic
c infection  by  saprophytic  fungi
Factors that predispose to fungal invasion of tissues
include alteration in the normal microbial flora as a result
of prolonged antimicrobial therapy, immunosuppression
following corticosteroid therapy or viral infections and
exposure to heavy challenge of fungal spores. In addition
to invasion of tissues, pathogenic fungi can elaborate
toxins, referred to as mycotoxins, which have a number of
toxic effects including immuno- suppression, mutagenesis,
teratogenesis and carcinogenesis. Mycotoxicoses follow
the ingestion of contaminated plant material, cereals or
nuts; feeds with a high moisture content stored under
o anos  aq A qmo [un nnoa pqi suopo
fungal toxins. Diseases caused by mycotoxins tend to be
seasonal as climatic factors often determine the extent of
 s    [ d o  g
pasture or on stored feed harvested during a wet season. A
point of distinction between mycotoxicoses and infectious
diseases caused by bacteria or viruses is the absence of
lateral spread to in-contact animals. A brief summary of
1973
important features of pathogenic fungi, related pathogens,
mycotoxins and mycotoxicoses is presented in Fig. 84.4.
Viral pathogens, either alone or in association with
bacterial agents, can initiate major outbreaks of disease
involving the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract or
the reproductive tract. Many viruses have an affinity for
particular cell types, and the stability of some viruses in
the environment facilitates transmission to susceptible
animals
 through
environmental
contamination.
Parvoviruses, which replicate only in rapidly dividing
cells, exhibit exceptional resistance to heat, pH changes
and disinfectants. Canine parvovirus infection results in
extensive contamination of kennels, equipment, footwear
and clothing of workers. The stability of the virus and the
low dose required to establish infection in susceptible dogs
        
parvovirus infection is an important cause of reproductive
failure in pigs. Transplacental infection in pregnant sows
occurs within 2 weeks of exposure, and infection of
embryos in the first weeks of life leads to death and
resorption. Infection later in gestation, before day 70,
results in foetal death and mummification. Infection after
70 days, at a time when foetuses are immunologically
competent, usually results in the birth of seropositive
healthy piglets.
There is wide variation in the types of diseases that DNA
virus families cause and in the range of species of animals
affected (Fig. 84.5). Herpesviruses cause diseases in the
respiratory, reproductive and nervous systems. As latency
is a common outcome of infection with herpesviruses,
these
 viruses  establish
life-long
 infectionswith
1974
reactivation and shedding of virus which may be periodic
or  continuous. Reactivation  of infection is  usually
associated
【with
  various  stress
factors  including
transportation, adverse weather conditions, overcrowding
and  intercurrent infections.   Natural  infections   with
particular herpesviruses are usually restricted to defined
host species.
Some members of the RNA virus families such as the
Arteriviridae and Bornaviridae cause disease in a limited
number of animal species. In contrast, viruses belonging to
the Picornaviridae and the Retroviridae affect a wide
range of animal species (Fig. 84.6). Retroviral infections of
animals cause slowly progressing life-long infections. A
feature of viruses in many genera in the Retroviridae is
their ability to induce neoplastic changes in specific cell
types. Viruses in this family include the avian leukosis
virus, feline leukaemia virus, feline immunodeficiency
virus, equine infectious anaemia virus and the virus that
causes maedi/visna in sheep. Acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome

by
human
immunodeficiency virus, a lentivirus.
The ability of some retroviruses to target helper T cells
results  in  progressive immunodeficiency  and renders
animals susceptible to opportunistic bacterial and fungal
agents which ultimately become responsible for terminal
illness in infected animals. The slow progression of
lentivirus infection is in sharp contrast to the rapid
progression  of the   aphthoviruses   which cause
foot-and-mouth disease. Transmission of foot- and-mouth
disease virus (FMDV) can occur by direct contact, by
aerosols, by mechanical means, on fomites and through
1975
animal products. Infected groups of animals, particularly
pigs, shed large quantities of virus in aerosols which, under
favourable conditions for virus survival, can spread over
long distances. In addition to domestic ruminants and pigs.
many wildlife species are susceptible to FMDV. The short
incubation period, the shedding of virus during the
incubation period, the relative resistance of the virus to
environmental factors and  the presence of wildlife
reservoirs in some countries militate against  the
implementation of effective control measures in many
regions of the world.

Orthomyxoviridae infect birds, horses, humans and pigs.
Some virulent subtypes of influenza A virus, which are
well established pathogens in animal p
populations, have
1982
also been implicated in human infections. A subtype of
influenza A virus which caused avian influenza in the late
1990s also infected humans causing a limited number of
deaths. More recently, a subtype of influenza A with
genetic similarities to swine influenza isolates circulating
in the pig population spread to the human population in
Mexico and resulted in human-to-human transmission of
the virus in a number of countries. West Nile virus, a
member of the Flaviviridae, was first identified in Africa.
It has spread throughout the world and is now the leading
cause of human arboviral encephalitis in the United States

Succeeding chapters in this section deal with the role of
microbial pathogens in diseases which affect particular
tissue structures or body systems. This approach provides a
clinically relevant perspective on the association between
infectious agents and the diseases that they produce with
emphasis on the pathogenesis of the diseases they cause
1985
and the nature and distribution of lesions in the tissues or
systems affected.

Interactions of microbial  pathogens  with the nervous
system
Microbial pathogens can damage the nervous system by
invasion and replication in the tissues, by provoking
immune-mediated reactions and by elaborating toxins. The
species, age and immune status of the host and the nature,
dose, tropism and virulence of the infectious agent are
important determinants in pathogenesis. Additional factors
of particular  significance which influence clinical  and
epidemiological features in nervous disorders include the
routes of entry and spread of the aetiological agents, and
the anatomical areas and cell types targeted. The route of
entry, whether through the bloodstream, along the nerves
or
through tissues by local extension, frequently
determines  the  anatomical location  of lesions and,
consequently, the neurological signs observed.
Haematogenous bacterial infections
Bacterial invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) can
occur via the bloodstream in generalized diseases (Table

suchas staphylococci orArcanobacterium pyogenes,

immune-mediated mechanisms. Irrespective of the nature
of
initiating
 mechanisms,  the
 subsequent 
 mural
inflammatory reaction, which may be accompanied by
thrombosis,  leads  to  parenchymal degeneration  and
necrosis.
Cerebrospinal  leptomeningitis  is  a  common  sequel  to
haematogenous bacterial invasion of the CNS. It is usually
purulent although mononuclear cells may sometimes
predominate. Pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
is an important indicator of bacterial meningitis. Moreover,
circulation of CSF contributes to the diffuse distribution of
the
meningeal lesions
through
surface spread
of
aetiological  agents. The development  of concurrent
ventriculitis can lead to increased intracranial pressure.
Suppurative cerebrospinal leptomeningitis, which is rare in
dogs and cats, is frequently encountered in newborn farm
animals. A major contributory factor to its occurrence in
this group is colostrum deprivation. Lack of maternally-
derived antibody allows septicaemic spread of coliform
bacteria, streptococci and other opportunistic organisms
from the intestines and umbilical vessels. Polyserositis and
polyarthritis are additionallesions whichare almost
invariably present

  bacterial
leptomeningitis.
The widespread distribution of lesions in most bacterial
haematogenous infections of  the CNS results in
non-specific  neurological  signs.  Although  neurological
disturbance may be the most prominent presenting sign,
dysfunction of other organ systems is usually present.
Haematogenous viral infections
1989
In systemic viral diseases, replication of the aetiological
agents usually occurs in lymphatic tissues prior to the
development of viraemia. When encephalitis develops, it is
generally non-suppurative and can primarily affect either
the vasculature or the neural parenchyma.

A number of different pathogenetic mechanisms may
contribute to the development of vascular lesions in
multi-systemic viral diseases. The endotheliotropic viruses
of swine fever and infectious canine hepatitis produce
necrosis of endothelial cells resulting in capillary damage,
haemorrhage and lymphocytic infiltration of vessel walls.
In contrast, the immunopathological mechanisms involved
in the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis result in
fibrinoid degeneration in vessel walls and a mixed cell
reaction
which
includes
neutrophils.
Fibrinoid
degenerative vasculitis is also found in malignant catarrhal
fever (MCF) but the contribution of immunopathological
mechanisms to the pathogenesis of MCF has not been
clearlyestablished.
In canine distemper and
1canine
herpesvirus 1 infection, discrete lesions are present in the
parenchyma of many organs including the CNS, with
minimal evidence of vasculopathy. Non- suppurative

a, vascular lesions predominate.
 In common with generalized bacterial diseases affecting
the CNS, the diffuse distribution of the viral lesions
produces non-specific clinical signs. Malfunction of other
organ systems may induce signs of greater relevance for
clinical diagnosis. Viraemic diseases in this category are
listed in Table 85.2.
When the neural parenchyma is specifically targeted in
viraemic disease, the principal clinical presentations relate

Infection via peripheral nerves
Microbial pathogens, which can invade the CNS via
peripheral nerves, are listed in Table 85.4. The clinical
signs produced by infections with these agents are often
attributable to malfunction of specific areas of the brain
and associated nerves. For example, invasion by Listeria
monocytogenes along cranial nervesfrom sites of infection
in the oral cavity in ruminants results in characteristic
microabscesses in the medulla and other parts of the brain
stem. The local tissue destruction, which is often
asymmetrical in distribution, can result in unilateral facial
paralysis with drooping of the eyelid, lip and ear. The
coronavirus which causes vomiting and wasting disease of
piglets is also considered to induce a characteristic clinical
response by affecting specific areas of the nervous system.
After initial replication in respiratory, alimentary or
pharyngeal epithelia, virus spreads in peripheral nerves to
invade ganglia such as the sensory vagal nucleus in the
medulla and the myenteric plexus of the gastric wall.
Replication in these sites results in vomiting
[and
constipation.
The sites of viral replication and the intra-axonal mode of
transport in rabies contribute not only to the clinical signs
but also to the length of the incubation period and to the
spread of the disease. Significant variation in incubation
periods, observed in individual cases, has been attributed
to the different distances between the point of introduction
of the virus and the brain, and to the rate of viral
replication in myocytes at the point of introduction. In
addition, intra-axonal transport of the virus to the CNS is
relatively slow and this may correlate with a prolonged
1994
incubation period. In the CNS, the virus replicates
extensively in the hippocampus and other parts of the
limbic system, often leading to aggressive behavioural
changes which are of particular significance in carnivores.
Centrifugal spread of virus from the CNS along nerves
produces infection of other organs, including the salivary
glands. Replication of the virus in the salivary epithelium
with consequent contamination of secretions is responsible
for infection of the bite wounds inflicted by the rabid
animal.
Although neurotropism is less marked with porcine
herpesvirus 1 than with rabies virus, infection of the CNS
in susceptible pigs is usually considered to occur along the
axoplasm of cranial nerves from infected oronasal
epithelia. Latency has been demonstrated in pigs with
Aujeszky's disease; the virus persists in ganglia and
tonsillar tissues. Latent carriers shed virus intermittently in
oronasal secretions and can be responsible for spread of
infection in pig herds. Intense skin irritation, which can
lead to self-mutilation, is a feature of pseudorabies,
particularly in cattle and sheep, although it may
occasionally occur in dogs and cats. Pruritus develops
when virus reaches the segment of cord supplying the
affected area.
Infections with lentiviruses
Neurological dvsfunction has been described as an
uncommon clinical feature in a number of diseases caused
by lentiviruses (Table 85.5). The development of clinical
signs is usually insidious and prolonged in these entities.
In visna and in caprine arthritis- encephalitis (CAE),
1995
randomly distributed periventricular demyelination is the
most prominent neuropathological feature in the brain.
Demyelination in the spinal cord is multifocal and subpial
in distribution. The pathogenesis of the demyelination is
obscure. Neurological dysfunction in visna rarely affects
sheep less than 2 years of age and manifests as muscular
tremors and ataxia progressing slowly to paresis and
paralysis. In contrast, neurological dysfunction in CAE
develops most commonly in kids at about 3 months of age.
with rapid progression from spinal ataxia to paralysis
within weeks. The clinical features of CNS involvement in
feline immunodeficiency virus infection include dementia
and other behavioural disturbances suggestive of cerebral
lesions. In equine infectious anaemia, spinal ataxia is a rare
clinical
presentation
which
can
be
attributed
to
granulomatous encephalomyelitis.

Viral infections which cause developmental anomalies
Viruses that cause developmental anomalies in the CNS of
domestic animals are listed in Box 85.1. The susceptibility
of the developing nervous tissues to the destructive effects
of these viruses is closely related to the stage of gestation
at the time of infection. Destruction of germinal cells by
these viruses results in teratological defects such as
cerebral cavitation and cerebellar hypoplasia. Teratological
changes may follow intrauterine infection with pestiviruses
 S       
virus and border disease virus. Hypomyelinogenesis,
another developmental defect in lambs with Border
disease, is attributed to delayed maturation of oli-
godendrocytes. Lambs with tremors typical

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)
Spongiform encephalopathies are so called because of the
characteristic vacuolation of the neural parenchyma seen in
affected animals. These neurodegenerative diseases have
1997
been described in a number of domestic and captive animal
species (see Chapter 83). They have many common
features including the nature of the aetiological agent.
transmissibility, and long incubation periods and clinical
courses.
It is widely accepted that the aetiological agents, prions,
are structurally modified forms of protein normally present
on cell membranes. The structural change, initiated
post-translationally
inthe
normal
protein
 through
association  with  abnormal  prion
protein, results in
accumulation  of these abnormal
1molecules. In the
abnormal protein, α-helices are largely replaced by
β-sheets   which
 resist
enzymatic
digestion.
This
conformational
change allows
polymerization, often
demonstrable as amyloid plaques in the brain tissue of
some  affected
 specles.
Scrapie-associatedfibrils
containing the abnormal protein can be demonstrated in
extracts of brain tissues from animals with spongiform
encephalopathy and serve as markers of the disease.
There is strong experimental evidence in mice and sheep to
support the view that, after ingestion and processing in
regional lymph nodes, spread of the aetiological agent to
the spinal cord is via the splanchnic nerves. Although there
are differences in lesion distribution between the various
spongiform encephalopathies, major vacuolar changes are
found in the brain stem, particularly in the medulla, in all
affected animals. In the later stages of the disease, diffuse
astrogliosis may be present. Clinical signs, though
somewhat variable, usually relate to loss of motor control
and to behavioural changes.
1998
Algal, bacterial and fungal neurotoxicity
Diseases caused by bacterial agents which elaborate toxins
affecting neurological function are listed in Table 85.6. In
the clostridial diseases, botulism and tetanus, the toxins
affect neuromuscular function. In botulism, following
ingestion of preformed toxin, there is flaccid paralysis as a
result of blockingof acetylcholine release 
at
neuromuscular junctions. The tetanus toxin, elaborated by
organisms in an infected wound, blocks inhibitory signals
from the  CNS with  resultant muscular spasms.
Morphological tissue changes are absent in botulism and
tetanus.
Focal symmetrical encephalomalacia and oedema disease
 n gs a e  s   
replicating Clostridium perfringens type D and certain
strains of Escherichia coli, respectively. These toxins
usually produce acute disease with sudden or rapid death.
Degenerative lesions relating to vascular damage develop
in animals that survive the acute phase and there is
progressive neurological disturbance.
Ingestion of preformed neurotoxin is the main method of
exposure in toxicoses of algal and fungal origin (Table
85.7). Neurological signs may follow ingestion of fungal
toxins in grasses of the Paspalum genus on which
Claviceps paspali is growing. Similar neurological signs
follow the ingestion of lolitrems in perennial rye grass
contaminated with Neotyphodium lolii and feed or pasture
contaminated by tremorgens produced by other fungi
Affected animals have fine head tremors at rest and may
show incoordination, stiffness or muscular spasms if

Algal and fungal infections
2000
Algal and fungal infections which may affect the nervous
system are listed in Box 85.2. Although lesions produced
by the fungi are generally located in the respiratory tract,
infection of the CNS may occasionally occur. A defective
immune  response,
immunosuppressive therapy
prolonged administration of antibiotics predispose to tissue
invasion by fungi. Infection with the algal agent,
Prototheca zopfi, may occasionally spread to the CNS
from a primary site in the intestines.

Chapter 86
Interactions of microbial pathogens with the male and
female reproductive systems
Microbial agents represent a relatively small proportion of
the aetiological factors which can affect reproductive
performance in domestic animals (Box 86.1). Protozoal
diseases, such as ovine toxoplasmosis and bovine
neosporosis, can be a greater threat to foetal survival than
bacterial, fungal or viral infections. When taken together,
microbial and protozoal agents account for less than 30%
of the diagnoses recorded in many surveys of abortion in
farm animals. Chromosomal, hormonal, nutritional, toxic
and physical factors may account for large numbers of
unspecified embryonic and foetal deaths. Certain microbial
infections are, nevertheless, important causes of reduced
reproductive performance in many countries.
The development and functional integrity of the male and
female reproductive systems in domestic animal species
are  dependent  on 
 delicately   balanced  hormonal
interactions. In male animals, the clinical effects of
microbial infections on reproductive performance relate
largely to tissue destruction and associated anatomical
alterations. In contrast, microbial infections of the female
tract can disrupt the hormonal interactions which influence
tissue and behavioural changes during oestrous cycles, and
those which are essential for the maintenance of
pregnancy.
Infections of the male reproductive system
2003
Microbial infections of the male reproductive system in
domestic animals may lead to the development of lesions
which adversely affect fertility. In addition, venereal
impact on the reproductive performance of susceptible
females. In some venereal infections, such as those
involving bovineherpesvirus
1 infectious   pustular
vulvovaginitis) and equine herpesvirus 3 (equine coital
exanthema), lesions are usually confined to the mucosal
surfaces of the penis, vulva and vagina. Other, more
serious venereal infections may cause metritis or abortion.
Infections which produce inflammation of the penis and
prepuce (balanoposthitis) are rarely of major clinical
significance.  Balanoposthitis,  caused
1  by  herpesvirus
infections in bulls and stallions, can result in ulcerative
lesions which may be extensive but resolve spontaneously
within a few weeks. A diverse population of bacterial.
fungal and protozoal species is present in the prepuce in
many domestic animals. Some of these microorganisms
are
potentiallypathogenic
 and, in a  suitable
microenvironment, selective overgrowth of a species can
result in clinical disease. The development of ulcerative
balanoposthitis due to the activity of Corynebacterium
        sn  n
example of the effect of this type of microenvironmental
influence.
Primary testicular infections are usually haematogenous in
origin, whereas those involving the epididymis generally
originate in the urogenital tract. Infection, once established
in the scrotal sac, may spread to involve both testis and
epididymis. Inflammations of the testis (orchitis) and of
2004
the epididymis (epididymitis) are often concurrent. Among
the bacterial pathogens which affect the male reproductive
system, Brucella species have a particular predilection for
testicular and epididymal tissues in the bull, boar, ram and
dog. In bulls, infection with B. abortus produces an acute
orchitis leading to tissue necrosis. In rams, infection with
B. melitensis also results in orchitis, whereas epididymitis
is the main effect of infection with B. ovis. The epididymis
is also the primary target of Actinobacillus seminis and
Histophilussomni
 infections 
1m
rams.Multifocal
suppurative orchitis in boars, caused by B. suis, is often
accompanied by lesions in the epididymis. Concurrent
orchitis and epididymitis are present also in B. canis
infection in dogs. In addition to Brucella species, other
bacterial agents which produce orchitis and epididymitis in
bulls include Escherichia coli and Salmonella serotypes.
Burkholderia mallei can produce testicular lesions in boars
and dogs. Arcanobacterium pyogenes is an important
cause of orchitis in bulls, boars and rams. Lesions
involving testicular tissues of stallions have been described
in glanders and in infections with Salmonella Abortusequi.
Viral infections in stallions in which orchitis may be a
feature include equine viral arteritis and equine infectious
anaemia. Orchitis and epididymitis have been reported in
canine distemper virus infection in dogs.

In bulls, microbial infections caused by Arcanobacterium

often result in seminal vesiculitis. The seminal vesicles of
the bull are also considered to be a major site for the
localization of Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo. In
the dog, urinary pathogens such as E. coli and Proteus
species can invade the prostate as part of an ascending
infection through the urethra.
Infections of the non-pregnant uterus
Although the non-pregnant uterus is relatively resistant to
infection, susceptibility to pathogens varies during the
oestrous cycle. In early oestrus, uterine motility increases
under the influence of
oestrogens, contributing
to
mechanical expulsion of potential pathogens. In addition,

when

increases. During this phase, the phagocytic activity of

Moreover, experimental studies have demonstrated an
increased  susceptibility   of  the  progesterone-stimulated
endometrium to opportunistic pathogens.

Many  of  the microbial agents  which invade  the
nonpregnant uterus can be transmitted by venereal contact
(Box 86.2). The outcome of postcoital infection, even if
caused by agents specifically capable of inducing uterine
disease, is usually
a mild short-lived endometritis.
Opportunistic pathogens, such as A. pyogenes, E. coli and
streptococci, are transient inhabitants of the vagina in
many species and are often associated with postcoital
endometritis. The mare appears to be particularly
susceptible to postcoital endometritis because the marked
relaxation of the cervix during oestrus facilitates the
introduction of opportunistic pathogens from the vulva, the
vagina or the external genitalia of the stallion

The uterus and uterine tubes are especially vulnerable to
infection immediately following parturition. Retention of
the
  placenta  and   trauma  resulting
from difficult
parturitions are important factors contributing to the
development  of  post-partum  metritis  and  salpingitis.
Abortion, both infectious and noninfectious, is often
followed by retention of the placenta and delayed uterine
involution which allow access for opportunistic pathogens
through the cervix. Post-partum metritis can follow
infection with a wide range of bacteria, some of which
may also be responsible for placentitis and abortion (Box
86.3). These infections, which may be mixed, often resolve
spontaneously. However, when severe, infection can result
in death from toxaemia. Moreover, a chronic metritis may
develop,   characterized  by   persistent   inflammatory
exudation into the uterine lumen
Pyometra
In cattle, post-partum bacterial metritis can progress to
pyometra, the accumulation of pus in the uterus. In this
condition the diseased endometrium produces insufficient
prostaglandin F2α (PGF2a), a luteolytic factor normally
2011
responsible for regression of the corpus luteum (CL). The
persistent CL continues to secrete progesterone which
stimulates hyperplasia of the endometrium and increases
its susceptibility to infection. In addition, myometrial
activity is inhibited, the cervix remains closed, and pus and
uterine secretions accumulate.

pyometra.

·Haemolytic streptococci

.Pasteurella species

·Staphylococcus species
The sequence of events leading to pyometra in domestic
carnivores is somewhat different. Canine pyometra usually
occurs in unbred, mature bitches. The disease develops
during dioestrus, when the oestrogen-primed endometrium
comes under the influence of progesterone. In addition to
copious amounts of intraluminal pus, a characteristic cystic
endometrial   hyperplasia
is
present.  It
has
been
demonstrated experimentally
that cystic endometrial
hyperplasia can be induced by injury to the endometrium
during early dioestrus. The injury may be produced
 o sn e n q  a
coli into the uterus. In naturally occurring canine
pyometra, E. coli is the organism most frequently isolated
from the abnormal secretions, although other opportunistic
2012
pathogens may also be involved (Box 86.4). Endotoxaemia
is often encountered in affected bitches, particularly in
closed pyometra. In some cases, circulating immune
complexes are deposited in renal glomeruli and the
resulting glomerulonephritis can lead to renal failure
Renal function may also be compromised by the reduced
cortical perfusion associated with endotoxaemic shock
Pyometra is encountered less commonly in queens than in
bitches, and its relationship to endometrial hyperplasia is
less clear because evidence of endometrial hyperplasia is
present in almost all mature queens.
Infections of the pregnant uterus
Maintenance of early pregnancy in farm animals and
horses is largely dependent on secretion of
progesterone by the CL. During the oestrous cycle, lysis of
luteal tissue follows synthesis and release of PGF2α from
the endometrium. Implantation of a normal blastocyst
inhibits this endometrial PGF2α production and prevents
luteolysis, thus maintaining pregnancy. Death of the
embryo results in loss of this inhibitory effect with
synthesis and release of PGF2α, regression of the CL and
return to oestrus. The dead conceptus may be resorbed or
expelled at a later stage. Although most early embryonic
deaths are  considered
1to be dueto chromosomal
abnormalities, some are attributable to infections such as
Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis in cows and
Klebsiellapneumoniae
2in mares. In these uniparous
species, expulsion of an early embryo may not be
observed, and the only indications of embryonic death may
be a slight vaginal discharge and late return to oestrus.
2013
Death of more developed foetuses during the first half of
pregnancy in the cow, mare and ewe has variable effects
on the persistence of the CL. In some cases, the CL
persists and dehydration and mummification of the dead
of the CL results in relatively rapid expulsion of the dead
foetus. In contrast, death of a foetus during the second half
of pregnancy in these species is often followed by
immediate abortion because foetal hormone production,
which is necessary for maintenance of pregnancy, ceases.
Corpora  lutea  persist  throughout
gestationinthe
multiparous bitch, queen and sow. Mummification
develops more often in these species than in uniparous
species. In fact, a cluster of clinical features including
stillbirths, mummification, embryonic death and infertility
(SMEDI) is characteristic of a number of viral infections in
pregnant sows. These various clinical presentations in
infected sow herds reflect the different stages of
development at the time of foetal infection. A similar
spectrum of changes in infected foetuses, along with a
history of infertility, is seen in viral diseases of other
species. In some of these conditions, such as border
disease of sheep and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV)
infection, there is also evidence of growth retardation.
developmental defects and persistent infection, all of
which are related to the gestational age of the foetus at the
time of infection. The development of persistent infection
with BVDV in cattle, for example, can occur only if
infection takes place before foetal immune competence is
established.

Microbial infections of cattle and sheep which can result in
abortion  are  indicated

respectively. Infections caused by a number of bacterial
agents, including
Leptospira interrogans serovars,
Salmonella serotypes, Chlamydophila abortus, Listeria
monocytogenes and Bacillus licheniformis, can result in
abortion in both species. However, differences between the
two ruminant species in susceptibility to a particular agent
influence the outcome of infection. Leptospira interrogans
serovars, especially serovar Hardjo, are important causes
of reproductive losses in cattle. Sheep appear to be
relatively more resistant to leptospiral infection than cattle,
and abortion is a rare occurrence although it may be
bovine leptospiral abortion, pathological changes in foetal
tissues and placentae are often absent and isolation of the
causal agent is difficult. Serological tests must, therefore,
be used to establish the presence of leptospirosis in an
infected herd because abortions tend to occur some time
after the acute phase of the disease. In contrast, abortions
in outbreaks of bovine and ovine salmonellosis occur
during the acute phase of the disease when pyrexia and
diarrhoea  are
clinically
evident. Although
many
Salmonellaserotypes
infect   domestic
ruminants,
Salmonella Dublin is of particular significance in bovine
abortion in many countries. When ruminants abort due to
infection with Salmonella serotypes, extensive replication
of the organisms in the placenta is a major factor leading to
foetal expulsion
Chlamydophila abortus is an important cause of abortion
in sheep flocks. Naive ewes, newly introduced into an
infected flock, and animals pregnant for the first time are
2015
particularly susceptible to infection. Infected animals
usually remain clinically normal until invasion of the
placenta in the last month of gestation leads to abortion.
Lambs, which are infected shortly after birth, may remain
latent carriers until they become pregnant. Placentitis is a
prominent feature  of infection  and,  occasionally,
multifocal hepatic necrosis is present in infected foetuses.
Abortion caused by Listeria monocytogenes appears to be
dependent on the ingestion of large numbers of organisms
and, in cattle and sheep, is commonly associated with the
feeding of poor quality silage which can contain large
numbers of these bacteria. Placentitis and foetal infection
are recorded in both species, and abortion occurs in the last
third of gestation. Infection and retention of a dead foetus
close to term can result in dystocia, with subsequent
septicaemia or metritis in the dam. Aborted lambs
occasionally have numerous small, pale areas of
microabscessation throughout the liver.
Abortion associated with Bacillus licheniformis is a
problem in cows and ewes in Scotland, the north of
England and Ireland. The infection is associated with
feeding of poor quality silage and mouldy hay. The
thickened, leathery appearance of the placenta resembles
that observed in mycotic abortion.
Bovine brucellosis, caused by Brucella abortus, is the
most extensively studied reproductive disease in cattle.
The disease is recorded in most parts of the world and, in
regions where control measures are ineffective, is usually
endemic. Reproductive performance in affected herds is
severely impaired, and there is the possibility of zoonotic
2016
transfer to the human population. Sexually immature cattle
are relatively refractory to infection. In susceptible mature
animals, especially females, infection may persist in lymph
nodes and other tissues for prolonged periods, without
producing clinical disturbance. Because B. abortus has a
predilection for endometrial and placental tissues, spread
of the organism and replication in these tissues occurs
during
 pregnancy.
Abortion,
the
main
clinical
manifestation of the infection, usually occurs during the
seventh or eighth month of gestation. There may be
extensive necrotic lesions in cotyledons with oedema of
intercotyledonary areas. Organisms can be demonstrated in
smears from affected cotyledons and can be cultured from
uterine fluids, cotyledons and the abomasal contents of
aborted calves.

effects of viraemia, septicaemia or toxaemia on maternal
and foetal tissues and, indirectly, on the hormonal
regulation of pregnancy. Those microorganisms which

The role of microbial pathogens in intestinal disease
The digestive system  is constantly bombarded by
organisms derived from environmental sources. In the
anterior part of the tract, members of all of the major
groups of microorganisms are capable of colonizing the
oral and pharyngeal mucosae and, in some instances, can
produce defined clinical conditions. Some of these
conditions, such as canine oral papillomatosis, are caused
by
  particular  infectious
agents;otherslike
eacute
necrotizing  ulcerative
gingivitisareassociatedwith
overgrowth of some members of the resident microbial
flora, often as a result of immuno- suppression. Other parts
of the upper digestive system are less susceptible to
microbial colonization. The stratified squamous epithelium
of the oesophageal mucosa and the acidity of the secretion
from gastric mucosal glands, along with the layer of mucus
covering
g both oesophagealand gastric orabomasal
mucosae, are inimical to microbial colonization. In
contrast, the environment of the intestinal tract is
particularly suitable for microbial colonization and many
enteric  organisms  have  evolved superficial  structures
which allow attachment to the surface of enterocytes.
Intestinal structure and function
The intestinal tract is the portion of the digestive system
  o fo s  iss  si 
absorption of nutrients, water and electrolytes. Although
there are considerable species differences in the length and
2026
anatomical positioning of the tract, its general structure
and function are similar in all domestic animals. The two
main parts of the tract, the small and large intestines, differ
functionally with regard to digestion and absorption; these
functional differences are reflected in structural differences
in their mucosal surfaces. In the small intestine, where
most digestion and absorption of organic compounds take
place, the mucosal surface area is greatly increased by
folds and villus formation. In the large intestine, mucosal
folding is less prominent, villi are absent and microvilli are
less numerous. In carnivores, the functions of the large
intestine are mainly confined to the absorption of water
and electrolytes. In herbivores, the metabolic activities of
members of the normal microbial flora of the caecum and
water and electrolytes. Goblet cells, which are present in
the mucosal epithelium throughout the intestine, are
particularly numerous in the large intestine where mucus
secretion is important for faecal lubrication. In all species.
after a storage period of 24 to 36 hours, the solid or
semisolid contents of the rectum are expelled as faeces.
The integrity of the mucosal epithelium is maintained by
replication of undifferentiated cells in the glandular crypts.
The immature enterocytes differentiate as they migrate on
to mucosal surfaces, replacing effete epithelial cells which
are constantly shed from the tips of villi in the small
intestine and from the surface of the large intestine.
In addition to participation in the digestion and absorption
of nutrients, enterocytes have an important role in
controlling water and electrolyte transfer between the
intestinal lumen and the lamina propria. The end result of
2027
this activity is the absorption of water from the lumen and
the production of formed faecal
material. Disturbance of the mechanisms involved in this
process is a major factor in diseases produced by some
enteropathogenic microorganisms
In the small intestine, absorption of sodium and chloride
ions and non-electrolytes, such as glucose and amino
acids, occurs mainly by transcellular transport. Ionic
balance in the cells is maintained by loss of intracellular
hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. Transfer of water from the
intestinal lumen into intercellular spaces occurs through
the tight junctions between enterocytes. This paracellular
       s
intestinal contents and the fluid in the intercellular space
The gradient is produced by energy-dependent transfer of
sodium ions into the space through the basolateral parts of
enterocyte plasma membranes. Because tight junctions in
the small intestine are relatively permeable, especially in
the duodenum and jejunum, back-flow occurs. The overall
balance is in favour of absorption with diffusion into the
capillaries of the lamina propria. Because the tight
junctions in the large intestine are more impermeable than
those in the small intestine, a high osmotic pressure is
       
propria, contributing to water absorption. Moreover,
absorption of volatile fatty acids in the colon results in
further water absorption.
Solute movement across enterocyte plasma membranes is
controlled by peptide hormones acting through  the
intracellular  secondary  messengers  adenyl  cyclase  and
guanyl cyclase. Activation of these enzymes produces

which depress sodium absorption and promote chloride
secretion by crypt cells.
Normal flora
The intestinal tract is bacteriologically sterile at birth
Within hours, the tract is colonized by a range of bacteria
including Lactobacillus species, Escherichia coli and strict
anaerobes such as Clostridium species, various species of
anaerobicGram-positive
COCC1
andFusobacterium
necrophorum. Because the ingesta in the anterior small
intestine tends to retain the acidity derived from the
secretion of gastric acid, these bacterial populations
usually establish in the terminal part of the small intestine
life of the host. In ruminants, the resident microflora of the
rumen, caecum and colon, which includes yeasts and
protozoa along with bacteria, is responsible for the
degradation of cellulose and for metabolic processes
involving
other
carbohydrates
  and
nitrogenous
compounds. Similar digestive functions are performed by
the normal microflora of the caecum and colon in
monogastric herbivores, thereby contributing to their
nutritional requirements.
Following establishment of a resident microflora, antigenic
stimulation promotes expansion of the gut- associated
lymphoid tissue (GALT), allowing local production of
immunoglobulins, an important factor in preventing
colonization by pathogenic microorganisms. Components
of GALT include intraepithelial lymphocytes and Peyer's
patches, localized aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma
2029
cells in the mucosa and submucosa of the small intestine.
The epithelial cells (M cells) covering Peyer's patches are
actively pinocytotic and appear to be able to sample,
process and present antigen to the underlying lymphocytes.
The immunoglobulins  produced
1byGALTare
predominantly IgA. They are secreted on to the surface of
the intestinal epithelium where they protect against
pathogen adhesion to enterocytes.
Short chain fatty acids produced by certain members of the
resident flora inhibit growth of exogenous bacteria.
Moreover, competition between bacterial species for
energy-producing  nutrients 
  and for receptors  on
enterocytes influences the composition of the intestinal
microbial population.
Pathogenetic mechanisms in enteritis
The specific intestinal niches occupied by the various
resident bacteria are determined by the affinity of surface
structures on the microorganisms for specific receptors on
the enterocytes. Changes in the normal microflora may
allow access of pathogenic microorganisms to epithelial
cell receptors leading to the establishment of infection.
Factors that contribute to changes in the normal microflora
include antimicrobial drug therapy and stress related to
changes in feeding or management practices. Moreover,
animals are particularly susceptible to infection with
pathogenic microorganisms
s during the neonatal period
before the resident microflora becomes fully established.
The significant pathogenic microorganisms associated with
intestinal disease in large animals are listed in Boxes 87.1
to 87.4.

a

mechanisms to produce the metabolic and structural
changes in the

diarrhoea and to dysentery. Because of the complex
microenvironment in the intestine and the possibility of
synergism between pathogens, categorization of the
functional and structural changes produced by individual
pathogens is not always possible. Nevertheless, certain
pathological alterations, including hypersecretion, villous
atrophy, mucosal distortion and necrosis, may result from
infection with particular enteric pathogens.

Hypersecretion
Functional  disturbance  of  intestinal  epithelial  cells  is
exemplified by infection with enterotoxigenic strains of E.
coli, a common aetiological agent of diarrhoea in neonatal
calves, pigs and lambs. The toxic mechanisms involved in
this type of enteric infection are detailed in Chapter 24.
2032
These enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli possess fimbrial
adhesins which allow attachment to enterocytes in the
small
1intestine. The hypersecretion induced by the
enterotoxins relates to the activation of adenylate cyclase
orguanylatecyclase
in enterocytes. Hypersecretory
diarrhoea results from a combination of increased chloride
and water secretion and inhibition of sodium and water
absorption. The excess fluid entering the large intestine
overloads  its  absorptive   capacity.  Morphological  and
inflammatory changes in the mucosa of the small intestine
are absent or negligible
Villous atrophy
Destruction of the epithelial cells on the surface of villi or
in the crypts of the small intestine results in changes in the
size and shape of the villi and enterocytes. The villi, which
become stunted and often fuse, are covered by cuboidal
epithelium. This villous atrophy is encountered in the
terminal  small  intestine  during some  infections  with
bacteria such as attaching-effacing E. coli. However, it is
most commonly encountered in enteric viral infections.

encountered in rotavirus infections of neonatal farm
animals to the marked structural disruption produced by
infection with canine parvovirus. These differences relate

epithelial cells near the tips of villi are affected.

uncomplicated infections, epithelial replacement with
clinical recovery may occur  within a few days.
Nevertheless, interference with digestive and absorptive
processes, due to stunting
gof villi and incomplete
differentiation of replacement epithelial cells, can result in
fluid overload of the colon with consequent diarrhoea. The
coronavirus of pigs, transmissible gastroenteritis virus,
also targets enterocytes on villi. However, villous damage
is much more extensive than that encountered in rotavirus
infections and may be permanent.
In affected newborn piglets, severe diarrhoea may result in
rapid dehydration and high mortality
Canine parvovirus targets actively dividing cells. In enteric
infection, the virus invades and destroys the progenitor
cells in the crypts of Lieberkuhn interfering with the
mechanism for replacement of villous epithelium and
leading to widespread villous atrophy in the jejunum and
ileum. Dilation and collapse of glandular structures may
produce irreparable mucosal damage. If stem cells survive,
restoration of the mucosa occurs. Because rapidly dividing
cells in the germinal centres of lymphoid tissues including
GALT are also targeted by the virus, secondary bacterial
infection often exacerbates the condition

cell-mediated
1 immunoinflammatorydisease of adult
ruminants, is caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies
paratuberculosis. The condition is characterized by the
recruitment of large numbers of macrophages and T
lymphocytes into the lamina propria and the submucosa,
2034
mainly in the terminal part of the ileum and large intestine.
The large numbers of infiltrating cells produce crypt
compression and villous distortion and atrophy. As a
result, the absorptive surface area in the ileum is markedly
reduced and there is interference with fluid resorption in
the large intestine. Lymphatic drainage from the intestinal
wall may be partially  impeded by  granulomatous
ymphadenitis and   lymphangitis  which   are  constant
features of the disease. Lymphatic blockage may be a
contributory factor to the protein loss, which occurs in
bovine   paratuberculosis.   Increased    permeability   of
vascular endothelium and of the tight junctions between
enterocytes may heighten protein loss. Moreover, loss of
plasma albumin into the intestine and the consequent
hypoalbuminaemia can result in further loss of fluid from
the circulation.  The protein- losing enteropathy of
paratuberculosis accounts in part for the fact that affected
animals become emaciated while usually retaining their
appetite.
The effects of proliferative mucosal changes are evident in
the intestinal adenomatosis complex in growing pigs. The
various clinicopathological syndromes within this complex
are caused byLawsonia intracellularis.As its name
implies, this organism is present and replicates in the
cytoplasm of enterocytes in the crypts, especially in the
ileum. Mitosis of infected enterocytes results in glandular
hyperplasia and the production of a population of
enterocytes    which    remain    undifferentiated.  These
undifferentiated cells are not shed and their retention
results in the formation of pseudo-stratified columnar
epithelium with expansion of glandular structures and
thickening of the mucosa. The mechanisms involved in the
2035
stimulation of mitosis by Lawsonia intracellularis are
unknown. Necrosis of the adenomatous tissues has been
attributed to replication of anaerobic organisms colonizing
the
terminal
ileum.
Proliferative
haemorrhagic
enteropathy, a sporadic condition affecting young adult
pigs, is part of the intestinal adenomatosis complex. It is
characterized by necrosis of the adenomatous epithelium
marked neutrophil infiltration into the mucosa and
haemorrhage. These lesions are consistent with a
hypersensitivity reaction to antigen derived from Lawsonia
intracellularis
Mucosal necrosis
Necrosis of the enteric mucosa is a feature of some
bacterial infections. The severity and extent of the necrosis
depend on the virulence of the infecting organism and the
immune status of the host. Cytotoxins of Clostridium
perfringens type C cause an acute necrotizing enteritis of
the distal parts of the small intestine in calves, lambs.
piglets and foals. The necrosis often extends to the deep
tissues of the mucosa and results in haemorrhagic lesions.
Severe, extensive, mucosal erosion along with heavy
neutrophil infiltration occurs in the small intestine of
young domestic animals infected with some strains of E.
coli and with Salmonella species. Moreover, endotoxin
derived from Gram-negative organisms is responsible for
thrombosis in mucosal vessels, further contributing to

Fusobacterium necrophorum, are found in superficial

feature of the disease, and capillary thrombosis is present
in the mucosa. Fluid and electrolyte transport in the small

interference with fluid absorption from the colon.

The role of microbial pathogens in respiratory disease
The respiratory system can be divided into the upper
respiratory tract comprised of the nasal cavities, pharynx
and larynx, and the lower respiratory tract comprised of
the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and lung parenchyma
Because the mucosa of the bronchus is not significantly
different from that lining the trachea, larynx or pharynx.
the passages that extend from the nose to the bronchi can
be considered as conducting airways, whereas the
bronchioles and alveoli are treated as integral parts of the
lungs.
The primary function of the respiratory system is to
replenish oxygen removed from arterial blood during
passagethrough
 metabolically-active   tissues   and,
concurrently, to eliminate carbon dioxide generated by
tissue metabolism. The lungs provide the respiratory
     s  s
and carbon dioxide can diffuse from blood into pulmonary
alveoli for elimination at the next expiration. Gas exchange
between air and blood takes place by diffusion across a
very thin blood-gas barrier, approximately 1.0 to 2.0μm
across and consisting of alveolar epithelium, endothelium
of the alveolar capillaries and, between them, the fused
basal laminae of the two cell types. Since this barrier offers
little resistance to the diffusion of oxygen and carbon
dioxide, the efficiency of gas exchange depends on how
closely the flow of air in the alveoli (ventilation) matches
2039
the flow of blood in the alveolar capillaries (perfusion). A
mismatch of ventilation and perfusion is the main reason
for impaired gas exchange in diseases of the respiratory
system; when the mismatch is large, it can cause severe
respiratory distress. Gas exchange can be impaired by
disease processes in the blood or in the cardiovascular
system as well as by disorders of the respiratory system
Microbial pathogens are responsible for several diseases of
        s 
in gas exchange. Hypoxia due to ventilation/perfusion
mismatch can be an important complication in pneumonic
animals and, also, in animals in which ventilation is
impaired by obstructive lesions in the upper respiratory
tract. The flow of air can be obstructed by mucus or
inflammatory exudate within the lumen of the airway or by
thickening of the mucosa of an inflamed airway.
Perfusion and ventilation provide the two main avenues
through which microorganisms can enter the respiratory
system.All of the venous return from the systemic
circulation passes through the lungs en route from the right
ventricle to the left ventricle. Thus, the pulmonary
capillaries  are   frequently
exposed

pathogens including bacteria and viruses that show tropism
for endothelial cells. Likewise, inhaled air exposes the
respiratory tract to large numbers of microorganisms, some
of which establish a complex microflora of both resident
and transient microbes in the upper respiratory tract (nasal
cavity, pharynx and larynx). The composition of this

compromised. For instance, Mannheimia haemolytica, a
commensal resident of the nasal cavity
in cattle, can cause severe bronchopneumonia and pleurisy
('shipping fever') in young cattle subjected to stressful
conditions, such as transportation, assembly in feedlots or
close confinement.
Aerosol contamination of the environment results in
organisms. This is more likely to occur during epidemics
of respiratory disease or when high numbers of animals
share a confined air space in poorly ventilated, unhygienic
conditions. Inhaled air often contains a range of inorganic
particles, organic particles and noxious gases that can
damage the tissues and facilitate colonization of the
airways by airborne pathogens. In ordinary circumstances,
the anatomy and organization of the respiratory tract
provides defence mechanisms sufficiently robust to ensure
that the lungs and the thoracic portions of the bronchi
remain essentially free of microorganisms.
Defence mechanisms in the conducting airways
The respiratory tract can utilize a range of defensive
mechanisms to limit access of inhaled pathogens to the
delicate tissues of the blood-gas barrier,  where an
inflammatory exudate would impair gas exchange. The
more important of these mechanisms are removal of large
particles  during  passage  through  the  nasal  cavity,
mucociliary clearance in the airways and innate and
acquired humoral defences.
2041
The epithelium lining the conducting airways consists of
ciliated cells, secretory goblet cells and dendritic cells. The
luminal surface of these airways is covered by fluid
secreted by the epithelial cells and by submucosal glands
The surface fluid consists of a viscous mucous layer that
overlies a lubricating serous layer in which the cilia beat.
The mucus traps and transports airborme particles, a
process known as mucociliary clearance. Both layers are
permeated by antimicrobial agents produced constitutively
in the underlying tissues. Thus, as well as acting as an
important physical barrier to airborne microorganisms, the
surface fluid provides a chemical barrier to colonization by
microbes that are susceptible to products such
1as
lysozyme, lactoferrin,
, defensins,  catheli-cidins  and
secretory IgA (see Chapter 3)
Structural features of the nasopharynx help to bring
inhaled microorganisms into contact with the mucous
blanket that covers the mucosa of the conducting airways.
Projecting conchae are responsible for turbulence in the
flow of inspired air through the nasal cavity. Because of
the turbulence, airborne particles larger than 5μm together
with associated microorganisms collide with the layer of
mucus and become trapped in it. The serous fluid, the
underlying cilia towards the pharynx, where all three
components are swallowed or are expelled by coughing
Mucociliary clearance propels the fluid in a caudal
direction from the nasal cavity to the pharynx and in a
cranial direction from the bronchi and trachea to the
pharynx. In addition, the conchae help to prevent
desiccation of the alveoli; they warm and moisten inspired
air as it passes through the nasal cavity and, in turn, they
2042
reclaim heat and moisture from the saturated vapour that is
expelled during expiration.
The mucosa of the conducting airways contains a dense
network of macrophages and dendritic cells, both of which
serve as antigen-presenting cells (Holt et al., 2008)
Dendritic cells are located both within the surface
epithelial layer and directly underneath the epithelial
basement membrane.
Branching
processes
of
intraepithelial dendritic  cells extend between   adjacent
epithelial cells and reach the lumen of the airway without
disrupting the integrity of the epithelial barrier (Vermaelen
and Pauwels, 2005). Thus, the dendritic cells are able to
sense, sample and process microbial antigens in inspired
air.
Processed

[ on  major
histocompatibility (MHC) molecules on the surface of the
dendritic cells. After migration to local lymph nodes,
dendritic cells present the antigens to naive lymphocytes
and induce proliferation of antigen-specific T cells that
target the microbial antigen at the site of entry (see
Chapter 3)
Defence mechanisms in the lungs
Within the lungs, the bronchi branch many times,
eventually forming small airways called bronchioles.
There is a gradual decrease in the number of goblet cells
and submucosal glands in the subordinate branches of the
bronchial tree with the result that these secretory cells are
no longer present in bronchioles. The narrow terminal
branches of the bronchioles are continuous with alveolar
ducts and the numerous associated alveoli that contribute
the   epithelial 
 component of  the blood-gas barrier.
2043
Approximately 95% of the lining of the alveolar cavity is
composed of squamous epithelial cells (type I alveolar
cells); the remaining 5% is composed of type II alveolar
cells that secrete surfactant, which reduces the tendency of
alveoli to collapse. Type I cells cannot replicate when
damaged; type II cells can replicate to replace them. When

must be able to activate and control effective innate and
adaptive immune responses which do not cause residual
damage to pulmonary parenchyma.

route may have evoked systemic defence mechanisms but
they have to contend with local defence mechanisms when
they enter the pulmonary tissues. Local innate defences are
offered by antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulins in
alveolar fluid (Box 88.1). In the alveoli, IgG tends to be
the predominant immunoglobulin whereas IgA is the more
important immunoglobulin in the conducting airways.
Surfactant also plays a part in protecting the blood- gas
barrier from injury. As members of the collectin family.
surfactant proteins A and D contribute to host defences:
they opsonize bacteria, they are potent chemoattractants
for monocytes and neutrophils, and they enhance the
phagocytic  activities   of  alveolar  macrophages  and
inflammation in the respiratory tract can be life-threatening
to an animal (Thacker, 2006).
As the most important antigen-presenting cells in the
lungs, dendritic cells are central to the integration of innate
and adaptive immunity. The lungs are well supplied with
immature dendritic cells and it is probable that the increase
in number in infected lungs follows arrival of monocytes
from the bloodstream. Cells that can react to pathogens
without the aid of professional antigen-presenting cells,
2045
such as y&T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, may play a
significant role in lung immunity (Nikod, 2005 ). These
cell types respond rapidly during the early stages of
infection. For example, &T cells are active in the early
phase of Mycobacterium bovis infection in humans, mice
and cattle. Data from experimentally induced sepsis
indicate that laboratory animals deficient in y8 T cells
show  more tissue
damage,
delayed resolutionof
inflammatory infiltrates and higher mortality rates than
control animals with the natural complement of y&T cells
(Hirsh et al., 2006). These findings suggest that y&T cells
at the site of inflammation act to regulate the tissue
residual damage.
Macrophages are present in the interalveolar septa from
where they can migrate into the lumen of the alveolus and
adhere to epithelial cells. Under normal conditions, the
primary role of these alveolar macrophages is to engulf
redundant surfactant and to protect the blood-gas barrier
from antigens or infective agents that reach the alveoli.
They phagocytose bacteria and they release factors,
including IL-8,  that attract neutrophils.  Activated
neutrophils phagocytose bacteria and they can secrete
factors, including defensins, TNF-o, IL-1 and IL-6, that
contribute to clearance of pathogens. The priority is to
regulate the host response so that the blood-gas barrier
remains intact and functional. Once the infection or the
inflammatory  process  has  been  controlled,  the
macrophages engage in the removal of exudate and tissue
debris from the alveolus.
2046
Mariassy et al. (1975) reported that alveolar macrophages
are seldom seen in the alveolar sac in cattle and suggested
that the presence of pulmonary intravascular macrophages
may compensate for the scarcity of alveolar macrophages
In cattle (and in sheep, goats, pigs, horses and cats),
intravascular macrophages are attached to the endothelium
of alveolar capillaries. These are highly phagocytic cells
and they play an important role in the clearance of
circulating bacteria from the pulmonary vessels. However,
they release pro-inflammatory mediators that are capable
of damaging lung tissue during inflammatory responses to
blood-borne pathogens (Caswell and Williams, 2007).
Microbial diseases of the conducting airways
Although infection may sometimes be confined to one part
of the conducting airways, the likelihood is that more than
one of the component parts may be affected. Rhinitis,
inflammation of the nasal cavity, can be a primary local
condition or it may be part of a systemic disease. Causes of
rhinitis include pathogenic microorganisms, allergens,
irritant gases or dust. Some bacterial and viral causes of
rhinitis are listed in Box 88.2. The basic reaction of the
nasal cavity to infectious agents consists of vascular
congestion, hyperactivity of goblet cells and mucous
glands, and cellular infiltration of the mucosa. Most cases
of acute rhinitis begin with a serous nasal discharge which
often changes to catarrhal or mucopurulent discharge when
the quantity of necrotic leucocytes and desquamated tissue
increases. The severity of the tissue reaction can vary from
mild catarrhal rhinitis seen in many bacterial and viral
infections to rhinitis with extensive necrosis of the luminal
epithelium, often with fibrinous deposits on the surface. In
2047
pseudomembranous rhinitis, the fibrinous deposits can be
peeled off without loss of underlying tissue. In contrast,
the fibri-nonecrotic (diphtheritic) lesions of calf diphtheria
caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum leave an ulcerated
surface when the fibrinous membrane is removed. Fungi
and mycobacteria cause granulomatous lesions. In the

Inflammatory processes in the nasal cavity can extend to
the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, as well as to the
paranasal sinuses and, in Equidae, to the guttural pouches.
In strangles, caused by Streptococcus equi, suppurative
lesions in the upper respiratory tract and associated lymph
2048
glands can extend to cause empyema of the guttural
pouches. Aspergillus species can also extend along the
auditory tubes to cause diphtheritic inflammation in the
guttural pouches, from which location the fungi and the
inflammation may extend to involve the internal carotid
artery and branches of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves.
Colonization of the nasal cavity by Pasteurella multocida
causes progressive atrophic rhinitis in young pigs. A
heat-labile toxin produced by the bacterium disturbs the
normal process of modelling of the conchae, leading to
deformity of the nasal cavity and the snout (see Chapter
91). The consequent impairment of the filtering function of
the nasal cavity predisposes the host to secondary
bronchopneumonia.
The pharynx and the larynx may be involved as part of
inflammatory diseases of either the upper or lower
respiratory   tract.  Laryngitis may   be part of  oral
necro-bacillosis (calf diphtheria) caused by Fusobacterium
necrophorum ; however, that disease may affect the larynx
in the absence of lesions elsewhere. In calves, laryngeal
ulcers develop as a consequence of septic phlebitis
associated with Histophilus somni septicaemia and
pneumonia. Toxins released by certain serotypes of
Escherichia coli cause oedema disease in pigs, in some of

The bronchi also respond to infection with hyperactivity of
mucus-secreting cells, invasion by inflammatory cells, and
variable hyperplasia, metaplasia or ulceration of  the
surface epithelium. Loss of ciliated cells is an early feature
2049
of bronchitis, leading to impaired removal of exudate and
the pathogen. In some species, bronchitis is associated
with hyperplasia of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue
(BALT) located around high endothelium venules at the
bifurcations of the bronchial tree (Bienenstock and
McDermott, 2005; Pabst and Tschernig, 2010). The
accumulation of B cells and T cells causes the overlying
epithelium to bulge into the lumen of the bronchus, and
that segment of epithelium contains cells specialized for
uptake of antigen, analogous to M cells overlying Peyer's
patches in the intestine. Hyperplasia of BALT is very
evident  in  enzootic pneumonia  in  pigs  caused by
Mycoplasma
1hyopneumoniae, perhaps induced  by
superantigens in the cell membrane of the pathogen. BALT
is present in pigs, sheep, cats, rabbits and chickens.
Microbial diseases of the lungs
The defence mechanisms of the conducting airways and
those of the lungs can cope successfully with the vast
majority of noxious agents that enter the pulmonary
system so that it is not necessary for the lungs to mount an
inflammatory response. Thus, the lungs are not subjected
to the tissue damage that can be caused during an
inflammatory response by neutrophil products released to
kill microbes, such as reactive oxygen species and
proteases. However, if the 
defencesprove  tobe
inadequate, the lungs are well equipped to respond rapidly
and effectively. The pulmonary microvasculature is very
extensive, intact alveolar capillaries contain a marginal
pool of neutrophils, and these cells can migrate directly
from the alveolar capillaries rather than from postcapillary
2050
venules as happens at most other systemic sites (Burns et
Gl.
2003). Moreover, additional neutrophils can be attracted to
the alveolar capillaries very rapidly in response to
inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-8.
Thebronchiolar-alveolar junction is a major site of
deposition of particles less than 3pμm that have not been
of the lungs result from bronchiolitis. Respiratory viruses
that cause lesions in the bronchi are likely to cause
changes also in bronchioles and alveoli. As the
inflammation progresses, exudate, desquamated epithelial
cells and inflammatory cells accumulate in the narrow
lumen of the respiratory bronchioles, leading either to
atelectasis ifthe airway obstruction is complete or to
trapping of air and over-distension of alveoli when the
obstruction is incomplete. In either case, gas exchange is
impaired in alveoli distal to the obstruction. The blockage
interferes with removal of exudate from the alveolar sac
and, in species in which adjacent alveoli communicate via
the pores of Cohn, there is lateral spread of inflammation
According to Mariassy et al. (1975), pores of Cohn are
small and extremely rare in cattle and, because of this and
the separation of distinct lung lobules by complete septae,
cattle are prone to focal pulmonary atelectasis.
Factors predisposing to pulmonary infectior
In the respiratory system, the outcome of interaction
between host and infectious agent depends largely on the
ability of the host to prevent establishment of infection.
This ability relates not only to the virulence and challenge

dose of the agent but also to the effectiveness of the
defence mechanisms. In many infections, the balance is

factors or by intercurrent disease in the respiratory or other
organ systems. Young animals are particularly susceptible
to the effects of deleterious environmental and other stress
factors (Box 88.3). Cold air temperatures, uraemia or
dehydration can affect mucociliary function by reducing
ciliary activity, slowing the rate of clearance of foreign
material. The rate is slower also in hot dry atmospheric
conditions as a result of fluid evaporation from the mucus
component of the clearance mechanism. Immunodeficient
animals are particularly prone to pulmonary infection, an
indication of the importance of local immunity as a

Patterns of pulmonary inflammation
The  significant pneumonic  conditions affecting  large
animals are presented in Tables 88.1 to 88.4. Two main
patterns of pneumonia, namely bronchopneumonia and
interstitial (proliferative) pneumonia, are recognized.
Bronchopneumonia
Usually aerogenous in origin, bronchopneumonia is
commonly caused by bacterial infection. Predisposing
factors, including viral or mycoplasmal infection of the
respiratory tract and environmental stress, can interfere
with respiratory clearance mechanisms and with immune
responsiveness. These factors are almost always involved
in   the  pathogenesis  of  the　 condition.  Lesions,
characteristically located in the anteroventral regions of the
lungs, consist of irregular areas of consolidation. Affected
regions of lung, which are reddened and swollen during
the acute inflammatory phase of the pneumonia, collapse
as it resolves. Inflammatory lesions develop initially at the
bronchiolar-alveolar junction, a location where inhaled
bacteria and aerosol droplet nuclei are often deposited.
2053
Neutrophil infiltration and serofibrinous exudation extend
from the original
1 nidus to surrounding alveoliand
bronchioles within affected lobules. The outcome of
bronchopneumonia depends on the virulence of the causal
agent and on the severity and extent of the inflammatory
reaction. When alveolar basement membranes remain

abscesses form. Clinical signs of respiratory involvement
may be minimal in chronic bronchopneumonia, although
there may be considerable economic loss due to poor

fibrinonecrotic form of pneumonia occurs in which the
bronchopneumonic pattern of lesion development is not
readily  detected. The
einflammatory1
 reaction spreads
rapidly through pulmonary tissues often involving entire
lobes. Pneumonias of this type are caused by infection
with virulent strains of
Mannheimiahaemotyticain
Pasteurella multocida in a number of domestic animal
species. Affected pulmonary tissue is swollen and dark red
and exudes blood-stained fluid from cut surfaces, on which
irregular pale areas of necrosis may be detected. The
interlobular septa may be distended with serofibrinous
exudate, and fibrinous deposits are usually present on the
overlying pleura. Septicaemia or  toxaemia frequently
develops and some animals may die suddenly.

associated  with interstitial  pneumonia primarily  involve

infection to the lungs is often haematogenous, particularly
in acute systemic

 in a diffuse

Chronic interstitial tissue changes occur in ovine
progressive pneumonia caused by maedi/visna virus. This
lentivirus is transmitted to adult sheep by aerosols and to
lambs in the milk of infected dams. The virus, which
targets monocytes and macrophages, persists and can
replicate in the presence of the immune response of the
host. Affected sheep may be clinically normal for several
years after infection. Gradual loss of condition and
hyperpnoea may then develop. At post-mortem, the lungs
do not collapse and may be up to four times the weight of
normal lungs. Grey areas of consolidation can be detected

Interactions of microbial pathogens with the renal system
The urinary system eliminates waste solutes brought to the
kidneys by the circulating blood. The kidneys transfer
these waste products from the bloodstream to a multitude
of blind-ended epithelial tubes (renal tubules). The waste
productsarefinally
 passed through
aseriesof
muscle-invested tubes that transport the urine to the
exterior (Fig. 89.1). Normally, the kidney and the ureters
do not have a microbial flora. However, pathogenic
microorganismscan
reach
  these  organs  via the
bloodstream (the haematogenous route) or by ascending
the excretory pathway. The pathogenesis of ascending
infection of the urinary tract differs considerably from that
of haematogenous infection of renal tissues. Valuable
insights into the pathogenesis and pathology of urinary
infections can be gained from a focused review of the
microanatomy of the kidney and of the outflow channel.
with particular emphasis on how  structural adaptations
influence dynamic host-pathogen interactions within the
urinary system.
The first part of this chapter is devoted to the interaction of
pathogens  with  the excretory passages distal to the
kidneys, while the second part deals with infectious
conditions affecting the parenchyma of the kidneys and
those parts of the excretory passages within the kidneys.
Ascending infection of the excretory pathway

Evidence from domestic animals and from human patients
supports the hypothesis that most ascending infections of

flora of the large intestine of the host, predominantly
strains of E. coli that possess virulence factors that enable
them to survive in the urinary tract. Female animals are
more prone to ascending infection than are male animals,
largely because of the relatively short female urethra and
the closer proximity of the urinary and intestinal orifices;
other contributory factors include more frequent exposure
to infection from the genital tract, and the greater
probability of the introduction of exogenous microbes

procedures or catheterization of the urinary bladder.

form firm attachments to the lining epithelium and they are
flushed out by the next voiding of urine. Many of these
microorganisms grow poorly in urine and the hosts remain
asymptomatic. Moreover, the presence of potential
pathogens in urine is not necessarily indicative of active
infection of the urinary tract. On the other hand, the
urinary system is vulnerable to attack by a range of
microorganisms (Table 89.1) that possess ligands by which

pyelonephritis in the sows, often with a fatal outcome due
to renal failure.

Structure and function of the excretory passages
2065
The kidneys begin the excretory process by non-
selectively filtering about 20% of the renal blood flow into
the tubules as protein-free fluid devoid of cells. The
epithelial cells of the tubules modify the composition of
the filtrate by selective reabsorption of many solutes and
water and by selective secretion of other substances. As a
result of these adjustments, approximately 1% of the
filtrate is delivered to the ureters as hypertonic urine which
remains virtually without change as it is propelled by
peristalsis along the excretory pathway to the exterior. The
pathway is lined by transitional epithelium, which protects
the underlying tissues from damage by the hypertonic
fluid. This specialized uroepithelium consists of basal cells
and undifferentiated intermediate cells underlying the
differentiated umbrella cells at the luminal surface (Fig
89.2). The stratified epithelium is sufficiently distensible to
permit storage of urine in the bladder and sufficiently
'tight’ to maintain a permeability barrier between the
hypertonic urine and the subepithelial tissues, including
the draining blood vessels. Uroepithelium is impermeable
from the underlying tissues into the hypertonic urine
(Lewis, 2000; Apodaca, 2004). Thus, uroepithelium
prevents significant changes in the composition of urine as
it is transported, stored and eliminated through the
excretory passage. It also acts as a physical barrier to
invasion by bacteria

Scanning electron microscopy has shown that the apical

contains several hundred transmembrane proteins called
uroplakins. The carbohydrate moieties of the uroplakins
act as specific receptors for several pathogens that colonize
the urinary tract (uropathogens). There are no cilia on the
umbrella cells, nor do they have the protection of a
continuous layer of secreted glycosaminoglycans (such as
mucus, mucin, polysaccharide or mucoprotein) that could
2067
impede attachment by bacteria (N'Dow et al., 2005). To
prevent pathogens from establishing a foothold on the
uroepithelial surface, the urinary system has to rely on the
flushing effects of micturition and on the antiadhesive role
of the soluble Tamm-Horsfall protein, a glycoprotein
released into the urine by the epithelial cells of the thick
ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Mannose residues in
Tamm-Horsfall protein can bind uropathogens, thus
competitively blocking
attachmenttouroepithelial
receptors and leading to the elimination of the bacteria in
urine. Members of the two main families of antimicrobial
peptides, the defensins and the cathelicidins, are secreted
continuously by uroepithelial cells and tubular epithelial
cells of the nephron (Valore et al., 1998; Chromek et al..
2006). The constitutive expression of these peptides is low,
but on contact with bacteria the epithelial cells promptly
increase the rate of release of the peptides, thus creating an
antimicrobial barrier on the luminal surface of the
epithelium. When inflammatory  cells respond  to the
presence of pathogens, the infiltrating cells act as an
additional source of antimicrobial peptides
The vesico-ureteral valve is the principalbarrier to
ascending infection entering the ureters. This barrier
function can fail either due to a developmental defect of
the valve mechanism or to high pressure as a result of
obstruction to the outflow of urine, whether by uroliths.
tumours, hypertrophy of the prostate, or malformations of
the bladder or the urethra. Irrespective of the primary
causes, the result is reflux of urine into the ureters and
urinary stasis, making the excretory pathway a fluid-filled
continuum which greatly increases the risk that pathogens
2068
Virulence factors of uropathogens
Although many strains of E. coli do not have the ability to
survive within the urinary tract, the uropathogenic strains
(UPEC) express virulence factors that enable them to
adhere to the uroepithelial cells, to evade or resist the
innate immune response of the host, to compete with host
tissues for essential nutrients and to proliferate in the new
location. The more important virulence factors expressed
by UPEC and by opportunist invaders of the urinary tract,
such as Klebsiella,Pseudomonas and Proteus,are
adhesins, toxins and iron-uptake systems. Uropathogenic
E. coli can be regarded as the prototype uropathogen,
whose virulence factors define the interplay between the
bacteria and the host tissues in the pathogenesis and
pathological  changes of urinary  tract infections. The
opportunist invaders of the urinary tract have similar
virulence factors but less is known about the molecular
basis of their activities.

Some adhesins are anchored within the bacterial cell
membrane (afimbrial or non-fimbrial adhesins), others are
present in the flexible tips of fimbriae (or pili), filamentous
structures that project from the cell membrane. Typically.
several hundred fimbriae are evenly distributed over the
bacterial cell surface. A single bacterium may have genes
2069
for a number of different adhesins but it does not always
express them: expression of each of the genes may be
subject to random phase variation or, to more specific
purpose, they may be switched on or off as environmental
conditions change. Thus, the bacteria seek to adapt to
different locations and  to
move
betweenthem
Uropathogenic E. coli make good use of phase variation as
they use Type 1 fimbriae to adhere to the urinary bladder
and P fimbriae to attach to the kidneys. In Type 1 fimbriae.
the adhesin protein is FimH, which interacts directly with
the luminal surface of the bladder by binding to terminal
mannose residues in the integral glycoprotein, uroplakin
la. Regardless of their source, most E. coli isolates carry
the fimH gene although it is not always expressed. In P
fimbriae, the adhesin protein is PapG; it binds to
uroepithelial cells, to tubular epithelium and to renal
vascular endothelium by attachment to a digalactose
moiety of a cell- surface glycolipid receptor.
Toxins
Uropathogenic E. coli produce α-haemolysin and cytotoxic
necrotizing factor 1. c-Haemolysin is a poreforming toxin
that is cytotoxic for a variety of cells, including
erythrocytes, leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and
uroepithelial cells. It forms transmembrane pores that
result in the loss of the normal ionic gradients, without the
loss of intracellular proteins; the disturbed osmotic forces
draw water into the cell and death ensues by osmotic lysis
At sublethal levels, c-haemolysin is a potent stimulus for
the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which induces fever
and the release of acute phase proteins. IL-1 is reputed to
enhance the proliferation of virulent strains of E. coli; thus,
2070
the elevation of IL-1 levels within the host may accelerate
the growth rate of the pathogens and increase the exposure
of the host to their virulence factors.
In uropathogenic E. coli, the gene for cytotoxic necrotizing
factor 1 (CNFl) is closely associated with the gene for
haemolysin. Of the strains that produce CNF1, only a
small
1 proportion are non-haemolytic. CNFl causes
rearrangement of the cytoskeleton of host epithelial cells,
facilitating engulfment of non- invasive bacteria. Also, it
has been shown to reduce the migration of neutrophils
across epithelial layers and to decrease their phagocytic
activity. It is capable of killing cultured uroepithelial cells
by apoptosis, which has led to the suggestion that it may
be involved in the exfoliation of infected uroepithelial cells
from the bladder.
Lipopolysaccharide
Lipopolysaccharide interacts with cells that have the
toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), such as macrophages,
neutrophils, dendritic cells and B lymphocytes. At low
concentration, LPS is a pathogen-associated molecular
pattern (PAMP) that provides early warning signals to
activate the innate immune response.  At high
concentrations, LPS activates complement, Factor XII and
macrophages, resulting in the release of interleukin-1
(IL-1), TNF-o, nitric oxide and other mediators that induce
fever,
inflammation,  disseminated
intravascular
coagulation and hypotensive shock.
Iron-uptake systems
2071
The availability of iron is low within the urinary tract. For
E. coli to survive in those conditions, the organism must be
able to acquire iron from the iron-binding proteins of the
host. For this purpose, E. coli produces iron-binding
siderophores. The uropathogenic strains produce more of
these iron chelators than do faecal strains. Inadequate
uptake of iron weakens the ability of the organism to infect
the kidney; hence, iron- uptake systems are listed amongst
the virulence factors of uropathogenic E. coli
Virulence factors of opportunistic uropathogens
Like uropathogenic E. coli, opportunistic bacteria require
multiple  virulence  determinants.  Opportunistic  bacteria
have a range of adhesins, fimbriate and afimbriate. The
practical significance of many of these adhesins has yet to
be elucidated but it is known that some of the fimbriae that
are important for colonization are subject to phase-variable
expression. For instance, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris
are opportunistic pathogens that cause lesions in the
urinary tract in dogs and horses. Both can express genes
for a number of adhesins that bind specifically at different
locations within the urinary tract. Phase variation is a
factor in the strong predilection of P. mirabilis for the
upper urinary tract where it causes pyelonephritis. It is
believed that the pathogen uses one fimbrial type, P.
mirabilis fimbriae (PMF), to become established in the
bladder. Then some of the bacteria differentiate into the
heavily flagellated swarming phenotype and proceed up
type, mannose-resistant/Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbria, to
adhere to epithelial cells of the kidneys.
2072
Klebsiella pneumoniae is another opportunistic invader of
o  e  s ssdxa   on An a
adhesins. Again, it is not known what role most of the
adhesins play in the pathogenesis of urinary infection.
Type 1 fimbriae are responsible for attachment of K.
pneumoniae to uroepithelium in the bladder, initiating
cystitis. They have been shown to bind to the cells of the
proximal tubule in the kidney, and it is thought that they
may be involved in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis
However, when the bacterium invades the underlying
tissues, it switches off the expression of type 1 fimbriae
(phase variation) because the fimbriae trigger destruction
of the bacterium by phagocytes.
In
cattle and
sheep,

tothe
Corynebacterium renale group of organisms (C. renale, C
pilosum and C. cystitidis) may move from the reproductive
tract to the urinary tract. Corynebacterium cystitidis causes
mild cystitis,while C.renale and C.pilosum cause severe
haemorrhagic cystitis which may progress to ureteritis and
pyelonephritis. This group of organisms and some other
bacterial invaders of the kidneys, such as Proteus species,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Klebsiella pneumoniae and
Actinobaculum suis (Eubacterium suis),produce urease
(Box 89.1) which hydrolyses urea to ammonia and carbon
dioxide and raises the local pH sufficiently to cause
precipitation of magnesium and calcium salts from the
urine as struvite and apatite uroliths. The increased
alkalinity enhances bacterial proliferation, the ammonia
damages the uroepithelium and the precipitates increase
the inflammatory changes in the mucosa. In addition, the
precipitates provide a nidus for bacterial growth in which
the pathogens are protected from host defence mechanisms
2073
and from therapeutic agents. The stones can obstruct the
flow of urine, diminishing the flushing out of bacteria.
Escherichia coli does not produce urease and it is not
directly associated with urolithiasis.

and interfering with the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.
Responses of the host to ascending bacterial infection of
the excretory pathway
Although uropathogens are highly adapted for survival and
proliferation in the urinary tract, they have to contend with
an array of host factors that tend to prevent infection.
Many uropathogenic E. coli are eliminated from the lower
parts of the excretory pathway by the passage of urine:
some
floatingfree,  somebound
1tosecretory
immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and adherent to (or within)
2074
neutrophils and others bound by the FimH adhesin to
Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. The invading E. coli that
become established within the bladder use their FimH
adhesin to bind to mannose moieties of uroplakin on the
luminal surface of the umbrella cells, an event that initiates
a complex train of responses that determines the outcome
of the infectious process. In the urinary bladder,
uropathogenic E. coli cause cystitis; if they reach the
kidneys they may cause pyelonephritis
Cystitis
Pathogens may ascend to the urinary bladder from a distal
location in the urogenital tract or, less frequently, they may
descend from active lesions in the upper urinary tract.
Attachment and internalization of the pathogens are
essential steps in the initiation of cystitis. Attachment
activates the uroepithelium. The cell membrane of the
umbrella cell expresses toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) which
recognizes bacterial LPS and activates an innate immune
response, triggering a cascade of signals (Fig. 89.3). This
culminates in an inflammatory response, engulfment of the
bacteria by the uroepithelial cells, exfoliation of umbrella
cells and formation of intracellular bacterial communities
with the possible survival of a dormant reservoir of
uropathogenic E. coli within the undifferentiated layers of
the uroepithelium. Such dormant reservoirs of E. coli may
seed recurrent bouts of cystitis.

The activated uroepithelial cells secrete the cytokines
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) that mediate
the early phases of the inflammatory reaction. In cystitis.
IL-6 is found primarily in urine but in pyelonephritis it
reaches measurable concentrations in both urine and
serum. Systemic IL-6 induces fever and stimulates the
liver to produce acute-phase proteins. It evokes both
humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. It promotes
the secretion of immunoglobulins, including secretory IgA
and the proliferation of T lymphocytes. The local release
of IL-8 induces neutrophils to leave the bloodstream and to
mount an attack on the pathogens. The phagocytes migrate
through the tissues and cross the uroepithelial barrier to
interact with bacteria in urine. The pathogens release
products such as α-haemolysin, LPS and CNFl, which
may decrease chemotactic responses.
2076
Although the host-pathogen interactions mediated by
FimH activate a cascade of innate host defences, they also
      a s  i
own transfer into the umbrella cells where they are less
accessible to phagocytes, antibodies, T cell activity and
antimicrobial therapy, and where the supply of nutrients
and the conditions for growth are more favourable than in
urine. Engulfment of the adherent bacteria by the umbrella
cells is a consequence of FimH-induced rearrangements in
the cytoskeleton of the umbrella cells and extension of the
cell membrane around the bacteria. The engulfed bacteria
grow and divide, establishing biofilm-like communities
within the cytoplasm of the umbrella cells. The
counter-response of the host to bacterial invasion is
activated by FimH: the bacteria-laden umbrella cells show
apoptotic-like changes and are shed into the urine, thus

However, some of the pathogens are able to escape from
the dying cells before the process of exfoliation is
or, perhaps more significantly, into the freshly exposed
undifferentiated intermediate cells and basal cells. Bacteria
that enter the less mature cells appear to enter a quiescent
state, in which they can persist as an intracellular reservoir
of pathogens from which they can be reactivated and
trigger further episodes of cystitis.
Infectious diseases of the kidneys
Pathogens can reach the kidneys via the bloodstream or,
more commonly, by ascending infection. Blood- borne
pathogens target the renal cortex, whereas the ascending
pathogens seek to establish a foothold in the renal medulla.
2077
The cortex and the medulla have different structures and
functions and the invading pathogens have to contend with
the consequences of these differences. To a large extent,
the early interactions between the pathogens and the renal
tissues in each of the two regions are determined by the
structural adaptations of the local vasculature and of the
associated tubules.
Structural features of the renal cortex
The architecture of the renal cortex is dominated by
glomeruli, urinary tubules and capillaries packed in an
inconspicuous interstitium. Within the kidney, blood is
supplied to the renal cortex by afferent arterioles, each of
which supplies two sets of capillary beds in series with an
efferent arteriole as the bridging vessel. The first capillary
network is the glomerulus. The second capillary network
includes the peritubular capillaries in the cortex and the
vasa recta in the medulla, both of which supply oxygen
and important nutrients to the cells of the urinary tubules,
deliver substances for secretion by those cells, and return
reabsorbed water and solutes to the circulatory system. Up
to 90% of the renal blood flow passes through the cortical
glomeruli before entering the peritubular capillaries in the
cortex; the other 10 to 15% passes through the
juxtamedullary glomeruli on the way to the vasa rectae in
the medulla.
The efferent arteriole, the second resistance vessel in the
portal system, is a major determinant of blood pressure in
both capillary beds. It provides the glomerulus with the
high blood pressure (up to 60 mmHg) required to deliver
an ultrafiltrate of the blood to the urinary tubules, and it
2078
ensures that the blood pressure in the second capillary bed
(less than 20 mmHg) is sufficiently below the colloid
osmotic pressure in the capillaries to facilitate the uptake
of the water and solutes that have been reabsorbed from
the filtrate by the tubular cells. The blood pressure and rate
of flow are lower in the post-glomerular circulation than in
other capillaries throughout the body, an important
determinant in the responses of renal tissue to pathogens.
Structural features of the renal medulla
The interstitium is much more extensive in the medulla
than in the cortex. When the tubular and the vascular
elements enter the medulla, they both adopt a similar
hairpin-like configuration before returning to the cortex.
The descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle
and those of the vasa rectae lie parallel to each other in the
medullary interstitium. That configuration results in the
filtrate flowing in opposite directions in the two limbs of
the loop of Henle and, because of the permeability and
specific ion transport
properties of the two limbs, it operates as a counter-current
peritubular fluid between the corticomedullary junction
(iso-osmotic) and the inner medulla (hyperosmotic). The
hyperosmolality  is  attributable  in approximately  equal
measure to the accumulation of sodium chloride and of
urea in the interstitial fluid of the inner medulla. The
countercurrent flow of blood in the hairpin-like vasa rectae
plays a significant role in maintaining the osmotic gradient
in the interstitium. The vessels are highly permeable to
both water and solutes, which permits the blood they
channel through the medulla to achieve osmotic balance
2079
with the surrounding interstitial fluid. Thus, the vasa rectae
serve as countercurrent exchangers that remove excess
water and solute that would dissipate the medullary
gradient.The
considerably increases the viscosity of blood in the vasa
rectae; accordingly, for the countercurrent exchange to
operate, it is essential that the haematocrit value of blood
entering the vasarectae should be low. Most
measurements of the packed cell volume entering the vasa
rectae give values of about 10% (Lote et al., 1996)
The medulla receives about 10 to 15 % of the total renal
blood flow at low blood pressure and at a flow rate of less
than one-fourth of the flow rate in the cortex. Because the
number of blood cells per unit volume within the vasa
rectae is less than in the systemic circulation and because
the countercurrent flow facilitates diffusion of oxygen
between the descending and ascending parts of the vasa
recta, there is a considerable gradient in oxygen tension
from the renal cortex to the medulla, to the extent that the
inner medulla may be “living on the brink of anoxia'.
These local conditions limit the antimicrobial activities of
the medulla.
The responses of renal tissues to ascending infection
Vesico-urethral reflux facilitates the extension of infection
from the urinary bladder to the renal pelvis. The urogenous
pathogens cause pyelonephritis, a tubulointerstitial disease
that results in destructive lesions in the renal pelvis and the
underlying renal parenchyma.
Pyelonephritis
2080
Pyelonephritis may be caused by specific urinary
pathogens such as Corynebacterium renale, C. cystitidis
and C.pilosum in cattle and Actinobaculum suis
(Eubacterium suis) in pigs, or by opportunistic invaders
such as E. coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella peumoniae or
Morganella morganii in many species of animals. Many of
these pathogens use different types of adhesins in different
regions of the renal system. For instance, most of the E.
coli associated with pyelonephritis exercise phase variation
when they reach the renal pelvis, expressing P fimbriae
rather than type 1 fimbriae by which, in the earlier phase,
they attach to the lining of the bladder. Similarly, Proteus
species use PMF fim-briae to colonize the urinary bladder
and MR/P fimbriae to bind to the kidneys. These
interactions are responsible for exposure of the renal
tissues  to  bacterial  toxins  such  as lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), haemolysin,
and
1CNFl;theyalsotrigger
intracellular activity of second messenger molecules that
activate  epithelial  cells  to  release   cytokines  and
chemokines. Although the primary objective of the host
responses is to defend the structures and functions of the
renal tissues, some of the responses contribute to
pathological sequelae. Recruitment of neutrophils by IL-8
into infected tissue is essential for clearance of the
pathogens but the lytic enzymes of the phagocyte may lead
to local tissue damage.
Pyelonephritis begins as inflammation and necrosis of the
renal papillae before it extends to the subepithelial tissues.
Pathogens that penetrate the epithelial barrier in the renal
medulla enter an environment that has structural and
physiological features that favour bacterial survival and
proliferation. The interstitial matrix is extensive and loose,
2081
       
the lesions they induce. Adjacent discrete lesions may
coalesce. The defence mechanisms of the host are not
optimal in the renal medulla. In the vasa rectae, the blood
pressure is very low, the flow is slow, and the number of
cells per unit volume of blood is low. Thus, phagocytes
arrive slowly and in inadequate numbers during the early
acute phase of pyelonephritis. Furthermore, the activities
of those cells that migrate into the inner medulla are
retarded by the very low oxygen tension and by the very
high osmolality that prevail there. Some pathogens, such
as Proteus species, Klebsiella species,  Pseudomonas
species and Corynebacterium renale, produce urease
which hydrolyses urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide.
High concentrations of ammonia can benefit pathogens in
two ways: first, ammonia inhibits the activation of
complement; secondly, it predisposes to the formation of
uroliths in which the pathogens are protected from the
defences of the host. The susceptibility of the renal
papillae to infection provides pathogenic bacteria with a
foothold in the kidney from which they migrate outwards
through the inner and outer medulla to the cortex, typically
inducing a wedge-shaped suppurative lesion in which there
are intratubular and interstitial infiltrates, largely of
neutrophils.
Responses of the kidneys to blood-borne challenges
Some of the more serious bacterial and viral diseases of
the urinary system, notably tuberculosis, leptospirosis and
infectious canine hepatitis, are blood- borne. In addition,
blood delivered by the renal arteries may expose the
kidneys to other challenges generated by bacteria such as
2082
bacterial toxins, circulating immune complexes, or
antimicrobial antibodies  that  may cross-  react  with
antigenic components of the glomerulus
The distribution of the causal agents within the renal
parenchyma is determined to a considerable extent by the
unique adaptations of the renal vasculature. Immune
complexes tend to lodge on the basement membrane of the
glomerular filter, evoking inflammatory lesions in that
location. Similarly, anti- streptococcal antibodies interact
with epitopes in the filtration membrane and induce a
proliferative glomerulonephritis. Approximately 90% of
the post- glomerular blood flow remains in the renal cortex
and as a result tubercular and leptospiral lesions are more
frequent in the cortex than in the medulla.
Bacteraemia/pyaemia
Blood-borne clumps of bacteria or septic emboli are prone
to lodge in the renal vasculature, predominantly in
glomerular or peritubular capillaries within the cortex; less
frequently they lodge in capillaries within the medulla.
Typically, this is seen as multiple small abscesses in the
renal cortex, a feature of several bacterial diseases, notably
those in which emboli break away from umbilical lesions
or from vegetative lesions on valvular endocardium.
Haematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium bovis is
likely to result in a number of small granulomatous lesions
in the cortex of both kidneys. The initial entrapment of
these acid-fast bacteria occurs in capillaries within or just
distal to the cortical glomeruli. The large throughput and
high oxygen tension of arterial blood within the
2083
glomerulus encourages the bacilli to proliferate, and on
occasion this can lead to rupture of some of the capillary
loops and the discharge of the organisms and cellular
debris into the proximal tubule. In turn, passage of this
infected material is likely to stall at the nadir of the loop of
Henle from where the bacteria can break out to initiate
lesions in the medulla. Enlargement and confluence of the
lesions in this location are facilitated by the physical
structure of the medullary interstitium, by local
impairment of antibacterial activities due to the slow flow
and low oxygen tension of the blood supply and by the
hypertonicity of the interstitial fluid. Lesions in the
medulla can erode the wall of the renal pelvis, enabling
bacteria to gain access to urine and cause descending
infection of the excretory channels.
Renal damage by pathogenic leptospires
The urinary system plays a very significant role in the
epidemiology
 of leptospirosis.   New   hosts  acquire
pathogenic leptospires by direct or indirect exposure to the
urine of infected animals. The spirochaetes invade the host
through cuts, abrasions, water- softened skin, or intact
mucous membranes, and they pass, via lymphatics, to the
bloodstream. Avirulent leptospires are cleared rapidly by
phagocytosis  whereas
virulent
organismsevade
phagocytosis. The pathogens can survive engulfment by
macrophages, in which they induce apoptosis. It has been
suggested that the organisms use the phagocytic cells as a
means of transport to preferred tissue sites (Merien et al.,
1997).The leptospiraemic phase elicits an adaptive
immune response which, typically, clears the bacteria from
the bloodstream within 10 days. Less frequently, the
2084
leptospires proliferate rapidly and cause an acute illness
that may culminate in death. In maintenance hosts,
leptospires can persist in niches to which immunoglobulins
do not have ready access, such as the proximal renal
tubule, the aqueous humour of the eye, the cerebrospinal
fluid and, in the case of some serovars, the female
reproductive tract. The renal niche is of particular
importance: the leptospires attach to the luminal surface of
the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and from there
they can be shed into the urine, the principal vehicle for
transmission of spirochaete infection.
Remarkably, prolonged persistence of leptospires within
the renal tubule of the maintenance host appears to have
little effect on the histology or function of the kidney. In
contrast, haematogenous dissemination of leptospires in
accidental hosts may give rise to systemic pathological
changes and functional derangements of varying severity.
Depending upon the severity and extent of the lesions in
the kidney, the host may develop acute renal failure,
chronic renal failure, or only mild and transient functional
disturbances.
The basic lesion in the various organs and tissues is injury
to the endothelium of small blood vessels. Blood and
bacteria escape into the tissues where the disruption of
normal vascular perfusion reduces oxygen tension and
attenuates the innate antimicrobial responses, allowing the
     s   
the tissues and organs. In the kidney, the leptospires can
escape from glomerular capillaries or from peritubular
capillaries. Leptospires break out of the glomerulus and
passvia
2085
Bowman's space into the proximal tubule. Spirochaetes
that leave the peritubular capillaries enter the interstitial
space in the renal cortex, where they induce lesions of
tubulo-interstitial nephritis, manifested by necrosis of the
epithelium and rupture of the basement membrane,
oedema of the interstitium, and a mixed infiltrate of
lymphocytes, monocytes and plasma cells, with occasional
neutrophils. From the interstitial space, the leptospires
move into the lumen of the proximal tubule where they
reside as clumps of bacteria attached to the luminal surface
of the epithelium and from whence they can be excreted in
urine.
Systemic infection by pathogenic leptospires can give rise
to a wide spectrum of responses including an acute
life-threatening disease, a subacute moderately severe
disease, a chronic disease, or a subclinical infection
detected only by serology. Virulence of the leptospires is a
function of components of the outer membrane that are
exposed on the surface of the bacterium and are expressed
during infection. The infected mammalian host responds
promptly with an innate immune response followed by an
adaptive immune response to constituents of the outer
membrane.The
major
surface
components
are
lipopolysaccharide
(LPS),
lipoproteins,
and
glyco-lipoprotein (GLP). Leptospiral LPS is at least
tenfold less toxic than is LPS of other Gram-negative
bacteria but, following recognition by CD14 and TLR-2, it
activates renal epithelial cells, macrophages and B cells
and, thus, it is central to both the innate and the adaptive
immune responses. LPs is the target for circulating
antibodies that opsonize leptospires for phagocytosis by
macrophages and neutrophils. The specific epitopes that
2086
induce protective antibodies reside in the polysaccharide
side-chains of LPs. Thus, the induced antibodies protect
against serovars that possess the specific epitopes but do
not protect against serovars that lack these antigenic
determinants. A number of surface lipoproteins also
activate an innate immune response, after interaction with
CD14 and TLR-2 receptors. Two surface proteins have
been identified as adhesins that attach to components of
the extracellular matrix: one mediates attachment to
laminin, the other to fibronectin. The adhesin responsible
for attachment to the epithelium of the proximal tubule has
not been identified but that function may be exercised by
surface-exposed proteins recently identified and referred to
as Lig (leptospiral Ig-like) proteins. Many pathogenic
leptospires release haemolysins. For instance, L. Pomona
releases a haemolysin that induces haemolytic anaemia in
young calves. An outer membrane GLP is cytotoxic and,
because it inhibits the activity of sodium pumps in
epithelial cells of renal tubules, it predisposes to
hypokalaemia.
Damage by microbial toxins
Several bacterial species release toxins that damage the
tubular epithelium. The epsilon toxin of Clostridium
perfringens type D causes degenerative changes in the
epithelial cells of both the proximal convoluted tubule and
the distal convoluted tubule. The damage is significant in
both regions despite the fact that the luminal surface of the
proximal tubule does not have the specific receptors for the
toxin that are present on the distal tubule of a number of
species, including sheep, cattle and humans. The pulpy
kidney found at necropsy of lambs which have died from
2087
acute type D enterotoxaemia is a product of both the
tubular degeneration and the very rapid onset of autolysis
that is characteristic of the disease. In humans, some
strains of E. coli, such as Ol57:H7, release a shigatoxin
that damages endothelial cells in glomeruli and peritubular
capillaries and has a direct toxic effect on tubule cells in
both cortex and medulla
Immune-mediated diseases
Immune-mediated diseases of the kidneys fall into two
categories: those that begin when antigen- antibody
complexes, preformed in the bloodstream, are trapped at
the glomerular filtration membrane (immune-complex
glomerulonephritis), and those in which the pathological
processes begin when antimicrobial antibodies bind to
constituents of the glomerular basement membrane, thus
creating novel complexes in situ (anti-GBM disease). The
antibody component of a preformed complex may have
been elicited by a microbial antigen or by a novel antigen
that had been expressed when a pathogen had damaged
host cells or tissues. Immune-complex glomerulonephritis
has been described in canine pyometra and in diseases of
viral origin, such as infectious canine hepatitis, feline
leukaemia, equine infectious anaemia, feline infectious
peritonitis, classical swine fever, and African swine fever.
In anti-GBM disease, circulating antibodies to a microbial
antigen bind to either a homologous epitope that is a native
constituent of the glomerular basement membrane or to a
non-  glomerular antigen that has interacted
Iwith
components of the glomerulus and has been incorporated
(planted') within the membrane.

Microbial diseases of the cardiovascular system
The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, the
system, blood flow is maintained by the activity of the two
adjacent pumping chambers of the heart (Fig. 90.1). The
right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary
circulation, a low-pressure system that replenishes the
supply of oxygen in exchange for carbon dioxide.
Simultaneously, the left ventricle pumps blood through the
systemic circulation, a higher pressure system that
transports and distributes oxygen and other essential
substances to the tissues and removes by-products of tissue
metabolism, including non-volatile substances. Blood
returns to the right atrium via the venous limb of the
pulmonary circulation before it returns to the arterial limb
of the systemic circulation. The indispensable distributive
functions of this closed circulatory system can be damaged
by microbial diseases that compromise the pumping
activities of the heart or restrict the flow of blood through
the larger blood vessels.
The heart: structural and functional relationships
The pumping function of the heart can be disturbed by
microbial diseases that affect the pericardium,  the
myocardium, or the endocardium.
Pericardium
2090
The pericardium is a fibrous sac within which the heart is
suspended from the great vessels of the systemic and
pulmonary circulations. The sac, which anchors the heart
within the mediastinum, is composed of two layers: a thick
outer fibrous layer and a thin inner serous layer. The
fibrous layer is composed mostly of collagen; it is stiff and
relatively inelastic. Because of its low compliance, the
fibrous layer prevents overextension of the myocardium
during acute increases in intracardiac volume, as it does
during administration of large blood transfusions. It can
expand
to
accommodate
gradual
increases
intra-pericardial pressure, as it does when the heart
enlarges during prolonged training of human athletes,
greyhounds and racehorses. However, an acute increase in
rather than to expand. This can have a significant impact
on the work of the heart.
The inner layer of the pericardium consists of a sheet of
mesothelial cells that covers the outer surface of the heart.
as the visceral pericardium or epicardium, and then is
reflected on to the inner surface of the fibrous pericardium
as the parietal pericardium. Thus, the parietal and visceral
portions of the serous pericardium surround a closed space,
the pericardial cavity, into which the mesothelial cells
secrete pericardial fluid, a lubricant that minimizes friction
during cardiac movement. Under physiological conditions,
the pericardial cavity contains a small volume of fluid (less
than 10 ml in the dog, and about 20ml in the horse). It has
a modest reserve capacity, provided by the normal slight
slackness of the fibrous sac and by anatomical recesses and
sinuses of the serous layer. Because of the low compliance
of the stiff fibrous pericardium on its outer boundary, any
2091
increase beyond the reserve capacity of the pericardial
cavity results in a steep increment in intrapericardial
pressure and interference with the pumping activity of the
heart.

cells
(cardiomyo-cytes) that fall into two broad classes: those
that contract and those that conduct the action potentials
that excite the contractile elements. The efficiency of the
pumping activity of the heart depends on the functional
2092
integrity of its various parts and on an ordered sequence of
events initiated by the electrical pacemaker  in  the
sino-atrial node. From the pacemaker the cardiac impulse
spreads over the atrial wall to reach the atrioventricular
node. It then passes to the ventricles via the bundle of His
and its ramifications Myocardial lesions that involve the
pacemaker or the conduction system can disturb the
cardiac rhythm and interfere with the function of the
cardiac pump
Blood is pumped during contraction of the ventricles
(systole); the heart refills during the phase of myocardial
relaxation (diastole). In diastole, the walls of the atria and
of the ventricles are relaxed and the atrio-ventricular
valves are open, allowing the heart to act as if it has a
single chamber on either side; blood from the great veins
passes freely through the atria and the open valves into the
relaxing ventricles. During the initial phase, filling of the
ventricles is very rapid because the atria are maximally
filled just prior to the opening of the atrioventricular
valves. In the final filling phase, the atria contract (atrial
systole) forcing more blood into the ventricles. Thus,
ventricular filling is mostly passive and depends on the
venous returm. An increase in volume or speed of venous
return increases the quantity of blood ejected by a single
contraction,the stroke volume:decreasedvenous return
causes a reduction in stroke volume. An example of this
physiological principle is seen in constrictive pericarditis.
As the disease progresses, the pressure exerted on the
relaxed myocardium by the fibrotic pericardium can grow
to exceed the normally low diastolic pressure within the
right atrium, thus impeding filling of that chamber and,
consequently, reducing stroke volume.
2093
Endocardium
The endocardium lines the chambers of the heart,
including the heart valves. It consists of connective tissue
underlying a layer of endothelial cells that is continuous
with the endothelium of the vessels entering and leaving
the heart. The endothelial surface has a negative charge
which repels circulating blood cells, also negatively
charged. The intact endothelium does not interact with
normal
platelets.
In
contrast,
constituentsofthe
subendothelial layer are highly attractive for blood cells
and, when breaks in the continuity of the endothelium
expose them to blood, platelet plugs initiate thrombus
formation at the sites of injury. Injury to the endothelial
surface occurs most frequently near the free ends of the
cardiac valves where the cusps are apposed as the valves
close. These endothelial cells are particularly vulnerable to
injury because of repeated physical contact at closure and
because the vessels supplying blood to the cardiac valves
do not extend beyond the proximal third of the cusp (Leask
s     o     
leads to the development of vegetative lesions that result in
stenosis or incompetence of affected valves. Incompetence
or stenosis of a valve can result in a high-velocity jet
stream that causes turbulent blood flow and damages the
mural endothe-lium (jet lesion'). Deposition of platelets
and fibrin at the site of the jet lesion results in the
formation of asterile mural
thrombus, to  which
blood-borne bacteria may adhere.

viruses or bacteria may invade cardiac tissues in the course
of a systemic disease, as occurs with foot-and-mouth
disease in neonatal calves or with Staphylococcusaureus
septicaemia in lambs and calves. The heart may be

microorganisms, the vast majority of which inhabit the
skin and mucous membranes as commensals ('normal

inflammatory reactions such as impetigo or gingivitis.
Periodically, small numbers of bacteria from these sources
gain entry into the bloodstream, where they encounter the
bactericidal activity of plasma and the phagocytic activity
of neutrophils. Thus, the bacteraemia tends to be transient;
however, it may result in colonization of the myocardium.
Normal vascular endothelium is an efficient barrier that
serves to protect host tissues and organs from invasion by
blood-borme bacteria but if the endocardium is damaged.
even a transient bacteraemia may result in infection of the
heart.
When  pathogenic  viruses or bacteria invade cardiac
tissues, they trigger an innate immune response. Host cells,
both parenchymal cells and cells of the immune system,
secrete chemokines, nitric oxide and the proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-y. Macrophages
and natural killer (NK) cells are mobilized and activated
2095
and enter the affected areas in response to microbial
in vasion.
Pericarditis
Although the pericardium may be involved in a variety of
microbial diseases, many pericardial lesions are not the
prime cause of morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless,
pericardial lesions are  not insignificant:  they cause
haemodynamic disturbances that contribute significantly to
systemic pathophysiology, even in acute septicaemic
conditions. Depending on the pathogen involved, the

fibrinous, serofibrinous, fibrinohaemorrhagic or purulent
in nature. The presence of fibrin in the exudate predisposes
to formation of adhesions between the parietal layer of the
pericardial cavity and its visceral layer (the epicardium),
while the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity
raises intrapericardial pressure which may affect cardiac
function as a result of compression.
The effects of pericardial effusions on cardiac function are
influenced by the rate at which the fluid accumulates (Fig.
90.2). A rapid increase in content of the pericardial cavity
soon exceeds the reserve capacity. The fibrous pericardium
stiffens with the result that the heart has to compete with
excess fluid for space within the pericardium. Further
acute increases in the volume of pericardial fluid result in
steep increments in intrapericardial pressure, leading to
compression of the heart, particularly of the thin-walled
rght atrium and nght ventricle. Compression (tamponade)
interferes with filling of the right atrium during diastole.
resulting in increased venous pressure and systemic venous
2096
congestion, with distension of the jugular veins, prominent
jugular pulse, and ventral oedema. In turn, decreased
venous return leads to a decrease in ventricular output.
Thus, at an advanced stage, the condition represents
right-sided, low-output heart failure. In contrast, when an
effusion accumulates slowly, the fibrous pericardium can
stretch gradually to accommodate a volume that may
expand to be several times the reserve capacity, sometimes
without clinical evidence of nght-sided heart failure. In the
horse, the stretched pericardium can accommodate several
litres of pericardial fluid, as it does in the subacute cardiac
form of African horse sickness. The volume of suppurative
exudate in traumatic pericarditis in cattle may be up to 4.5
litres or more.
Figure 90.2 Changes in pericardial pressure associated
with cardiac tamponade. Pericardial pressure curve on the
left shows the steep rise in pressure when the volume of
pericardial fluid quickly exceeds the limit to which the
parietal pericardium can stretch. The curve on the right
represents a slower rate of filling of the pericardial sac,
which gives the parietal pericardium more time to
accommodate a larger volume of fluid.

Suppurative pericarditis in cattle is usually a sequel to
penetration of the wall of the reticulum by a sharp foreign
body, such as a nail or a piece of wire which then
perforates the diaphragm and the pericardium. The result is
a fistulous tract that can introduce a range of pathogens,
such
asArcanobacterium
pyogenes,
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Fusobacterium necro-phorum, into the
pericardial  cavity.  The pericardial  exudate  is  copious,
fibropurulent and putrid. The toxic effects of the pathogens
and of the putrid exudate are responsible for the systemic
responses: fever, depression and leukocytosis. The volume
of the sequestered exudate and the pericardial adhesions
that develop over time impair cardiac function, leading to
tamponade and right-heart failure. In animals that survive
the systemic illness, the pericardial lesions undergo
resolution or organization. In non-suppurative pericarditis.
the fluid is resorbed and residual lesions vary in extent
from string-like adhesions between the two pericardial
surfaces to diffuse fibrosis which obliterates extensive
segments of the cavity and constricts the heart. In
suppurative pericarditis, organization of the adhesions may
be so extensive that the pericardial cavity is obliterated.
This  chronic  constrictive  pericarditis  interferes  with
2098
cardiac  filling   and  cardiac  output,  and  leads to
compensatory hypertrophy of the myocardium and,
eventually, to congestive heart failure.
Myocarditis
Inflammation of the myocardium develops in the course of
many infectious and toxic diseases but is an uncommon
primary lesion. Myocarditis commonly occurs as a
infections of young animals. In other circumstances, the
inflammatory reaction may be a local response to necrosis
of myocardial cells. For instance, when neonatal calves.
lambs, or piglets die suddenly during outbreaks of
foot-and-mouth disease, the inflammatory changes in the
myocardium are secondary to virus-induced necrosis of the
cardiac muscle cells
Myocarditis may result  from invasion  of  the cardiac
muscle by bacteria, viruses, protozoa or fungi. Also, it may
bea consequence of circulating toxins or of
infection-induced immune reactions.  The inflammatory
process may be focal or diffuse; the primary damage may
be to the cardiomyocytes, the conducting system, the
vascular elements,
the
autonomicnerves  or the
interstitium. Clinical signs depend on the number, size, or
location of the lesions. Some focal lesions may not cause
cloaked by the primary systemic illness. Lesions that
impinge on the conduction system can interfere with the
electrical conductance of the heart, resulting in partial or
complete heart block and associated arrhythmia. Thus.

intolerance, cardiac arrhythmia, or sudden death. In some
cases of acute myocarditis, the lesions may resolve
completely or with only insignificant residual scars; other
cases may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic
congestive heart failure.
Bacterial myocarditis
Bacterial myocarditis tends to be focal in distribution,
often in the form of miliary lesions resulting from
haematogenous dissemination of pyogenic pathogens. Foci
of acute  suppurative myocarditis are a
featureof
septicaemia
 due 
to
Listeria
monocytogenes
or
Actinobacillus equuli. Other necrotizing bacteria, such as
Rhodococcus
equ,
Fusobacteriumnecrophorum,
Clostri-dium piliforme, staphylococci and streptococci,
reach the myocardium from primary foci elsewhere in the
body, as in navel ill, strangles, or metritis
Necrotizing and haemorrhagic myocardial lesions due to
Clostridium chauvoei have been responsible for sudden
deaths in calves and lambs without evidence of blackleg
lesions in skeletal muscle. In cattle, the myocardial form of
the Histophilus somni disease
complex may cause sudden death in animals that have not
shown previous signs of illness, or it may develop as a
Depletion of the number of circulating granulocytes can
predispose animals to bacterial myocarditis. Infection with
certain strains of Anaplasma phagocy-tophilum that cause
tick-borne fever in ruminants results in significant
2100
reductions in B and T lymphocyte and neutrophil numbers
in young lambs, increasing susceptibility of these animals
toStaphylococcus aureus, the causal agent of tick
pyaemia. Staphylococci, introduced into the tissues by tick
bites, enter the bloodstream and 
become   widely
disseminated within the body, forming abscesses in many
internal  organs
including the myocardium. Severe
depression in the number of platelets and neutrophils also
occurs in bracken fern poisoning in ruminants. The
thrombocy-topaenia is
  responsible  for   multiple
haemorrhages throughout the body including the intestinal
mucosa, which enable members of the intestinal microflora
to invade the bloodstream. The neutropaenia weakens the
ability of the host to terminate the bacteraemia, and the
bacterial emboli proceed to cause multiple small lesions in
the myocardium.
Bacteria may enter the myocardium from primary lesions
      d  
myocarditis may arise as an extension from traumatic
pericarditis caused by an infected foreign body penetrating
from the reticulum. This condition can involve a range of
bacteria that mayinclude Arcanobacterium pyogenes,
staphylococci, streptococci, and Histophilus somni. Friable
vegetations on the cardiac valves can be a source of
infected emboli that lodge in the myocardium ( Table 90.1).
Viral myocarditis
Myocarditis has been observed in several viral diseases of
animals. In many of these diseases, the myocardium is not
a primary target of the virus; however, extension of a
systemic viral infection to the myocardium is likely to
2101
increase morbidity and mortality because virus-induced
degenerationof cardiomyocytes
 and  the associated
inflammatory response cause haemodynamic disturbances
that impair the homeostatic responses of the cardiovascular
system to the systemic pathological changes.

mainly natural killer (NK) cells, y& T cells and
macrophages, which enter the affected areas where the
mononuclear cells provide an additionalsource of
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Some large NK-like cells in
this first wave of inflammatory cells release perforin
molecules that cause lethal damage by forming pores in the
cell membranes of the cardiomyocytes. In conjunction
with the cytokines and nitric oxide, the mononuclear cells
begin to eliminate the virus from the myocardium, a
process that is enhanced when the myocardium is
infiltrated by another wave of mononuclear cells which
marks the onset of an adaptive immune response.
The second wave of cells is dominated by lymphocytes.
largely T cells and a smaller number of B cells. Both CD4
helper T cells and CD8tcytotoxic T cells are required for
the development of myocarditis. It seems that CD4+T cells
are responsible primarily for the induction of the adaptive
immune response, while CD8+T cells are necessary for the
production of lesions (Rose et al., 1993 ). Both T cells and
B cells play important protective roles in limiting
proliferation of the viral pathogens: the cytotoxic T cells
by    destruction    and
1 elimination  of virus-infected
cardiomyocytes, the B cells by producing neutralizing
2103
antiviral antibody. On many occasions, these cellular and
humoral immune responses are sufficient to clear the viral
infection, often with little residual damage. Ideally, the
local immune response should revert to its resting state

lesions.
Continuous,
excessive expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
protracted activation of T cells can cause even greater
damage to the cardiomyocytes thanthe primary virus
infection. Some cardiomyocytes may become targets for
the immune system because injury during the early phase
of the infection allows antigen-presenting cells access to
myocardial antigens such as cardiac myosin that are
normally sequestered within the cell. Thus, this second
phase (chronic phase) of the pathological process is an
autoimmune response provoked by the initial virus
infection. Other cardiomyocytes become targets because
they express antigens that are structurally similar to viral
response.
Persistent activation of responses can cause extensive
destruction of cardiomyocytes and, since the myocardium
lacks the ability to produce a new generation of muscle
cells to replace them, the loss of contractile elements is
permanent. The surviving muscle cells hypertrophy to
maintain cardiac output. However, this compensatory
response may not be sufficient to offset further
deterioration in cardiac function. Loss of muscle cells is
followed by the deposition and accumulation of collagen, a
2104
relatively inelastic material in the extracellular spaces
Progressive accumulation of this fibrillar collagen stiffens
the myocardium and, in conjunction with progressive
hypertrophy of muscle fibres, it changes the size and shape
of the cardiac chambers. Stroke volume is reduced because
the collagen interferes with relaxation of the myocardium
during diastole and  with  contractility during systole.
Excess collagen within the interstitium may encase muscle
fibres, disrupt orderly transmission of force between
contracting myocytes, and thereby impair the pumping
activity   of
hypertro-phied  hearts.  Ultimately,  the
progression of these changes in structure and function
leads to the development of cardiomyopathy and cardiac
failure.
In general, viral myocarditis occurs more often and with a
higher mortality rate in young animals than in adult
animals. For some viruses, such as canine parvovirus,
susceptibilityof young
hosts  to infection may  be
associated with the presence of mitotically active cells in
the myocardium of the neonatal animal. For other viruses,
age-dependent susceptibility is determined by changes in
the expression of specific receptors. For instance, mouse
models of myocarditis induced by coxsackievirus B have
with
a spontaneous
decline  in expression of the
coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor on myocardial cells as
the host progresses from foetal life to adulthood. The
patterns of acute viral disease in adult animals reflect the

described as ‘tiger heart'. Sudden death and streaky
myocardial lesions are seen also in canine parvovirus
infection. In 1978, when parvovirus infection was
2106
identified as a significant cause of disease in dogs, it was
recognized that the small intestine was a target organ for
the virus in dogs of any age but that the virus had a
predilection for the myocardium in pups up to 8 weeks of
age. Typically, in these animals the virus-induced diffuse

myocarditis was responsible for a high mortality rate in
neonatal pups. In the intervening years, natural exposure
and vaccination have raised immunity to the virus in the
adult dog population and, consequently, there has been a
substantial decline in the susceptibility of neonatal pups to
the cardiac form of parvoviral disease. The viruses of
canine distemper and infectious canine hepatitis also show
a predilection for  the myocardium in neonatal  and
unweaned pups.
Endocarditis
Endocarditis is usually restricted to the cardiac valves but
it may extend to the mural endocardium lining the
chambers. In all species, single or multiple lesions may
develop on any of the valves but in some species there is
variation in relative frequency among the valves. In cattle,
infective endocarditis

bacteraemia is often of low grade (less than 10
colony-forming units per ml) and it is cleared within 15 to
20 minutes (Seifert and Wisplinghoff, 2005 ), it can result
in colonization of the endocardium.

The inflammatory process can be initiated by some
virulent bacteria, such as S. aureus, that are able to bind to
undamaged  endothelial cells  on   a  cardiac  valve.
Attachment of S. aureus to the endocardium, whether to
undamaged endothelial cells or to preformed thrombus on
2108
damaged endothelium, is mediated by fibrinogen-binding
proteins. Bacteria that require pre-existing damage to the
endothelium enter the process at a later stage. They attach
to a sterile thrombus that has formed where the continuity
of the endothelial cells has been broken. This infected
thrombusthendevelops
intoa
avegetative
lesion
(cauliflower-like) on the cardiac
Cvalve. The critical
elements in the pathogenesis of the vegetative lesion are
focal damage to the endocardium, formation of a sterile
thrombus  at that site,  persistent or intermittent
bacteraemia,  colonization of the thrombus  by  the
blood-borne bacteria, and serial additions of platelets and
fibrin as the bacteria proliferate in the thrombus.
Usually, the lesion begins where damage to the
endothelium of a valve has exposed the subendothelial
tissues. Circulating platelets adhere to collagen in the
exposed tissues, and the aggregated platelets degranulate
and stimulate the deposition of fibrin. This leads to the
formation of a sterile thrombus accompanied by an
inflammatory response. Some blood-borme bacteria are
able to adhere to components of this sterile thrombus. The
bacteria proliferate, and stimulate deposition of more
platelets and fibrin, thus promoting the growth of the
infected thrombus within which the bacteria are protected
from host defence mechanisms. The result is continued
enlargement of the thrombus by serial deposition of layers
of platelets and fibrin. The vegetative lesions are friable
and liable to shed emboli into the circulation, leading to
infarcts and metastatic foci of infection in peripheral
organs, especially in the lungs when the emboli enter the
pulmonary circuit and in the kidneys when the emboli are
delivered by the systemic circulation. The infection may
2109
extend to the myocardium or the pericardium. In mature
thrombi, organization of the deposits of fibrin to fibrous
connective tissue proceeds from the base, producing
irregular, nodular, verrucose (wart-like) lesions.
Infections of the vascular channels
The vascular system can be divided arbitrarily into the
arterial system, the microvasculature, the venous system,
and the lymphatic system (Maxie and Robinson, 2007).
The microvasculature, comprised of arterioles, capillaries
and venules, is the exchange system in which fluids, gases.
electrolytes, hormones, nutrients, inflammatory cells and
waste products are transferred between the blood and the
extravascular tissues. The endothelium and the associated
basal membrane constitute the main permeability barrier
across which the exchanges take place. In addition to its
function as a permeability barrier, the endothelium plays
important roles in the development and remodelling of the
vasculature, in the maintenance of vascular tone, and in the
prevention of intravascular coagulation. Remodelling of
blood vessels is an important feature of host responses to
tissue damage induced by pathogens
Endothelium plays a key role in the host response to
infectious agents by regulating  the  extravasation  of
leukocytes and by producing inflammatory cytokines.
When inflammatory cells are not required in the tissues,
the endothelium retains the leukocytes within the
bloodstream. When a pathogen invades, the endothelial
cells of the postcapillary venules can be activated to
express adhesion molecules and to secrete chemokines that
2110
promote the emigration of leukocytes into tissues where
the cells are required.
The definition of inflammation as a local reaction of
vascular connective tissue to injury places the vessels of
the microcirculation at the core of all inflammatory
responses to pathogens.  The participation of the
recurring theme in the chapters that deal with infections of
individual body systems. In this chapter, the focus is on the
pathological effects of infectious agents on the structure
and function of all categories of vascular channels,
including arteries, veins and lymphatics.
Inflammation can develop independently in the three
categories of large vascular channels as arteritis, phlebitis
or lymphangitis. When all three types of vessels are
involved simultaneously, the term vasculitis is applied to
these vascular changes. The histopathological features of
vasculitis include the presence of inflammatory cells
within and around the wall of a blood vessel accompanied
by damage to the wall in the form of deposition of fibrin,
degeneration of collagen, and necrosis of endothelial cells
and smooth muscle cells (Maxie and Robinson, 2o07).
Vasculitis is an important component of many diseases of
animals.
An infected lesion in the wall of an artery may arise by
inward extension from infected tissue through which the
vessel travels. Alternatively, the vascular lesion may be an
outward extension of a response to a blood-borne pathogen
that has invaded the wall of the vessel from the lumen or
from the vasa vasorum. A number of bacteria, particularly
2111
rickettsiae, and some viruses, show tropism for endothelial
cells. Amongst such endotheliotropic agents are the
bacteria Histophilus somni, the rickettsiae responsible for

fever in dogs, and the viruses of equine viral arteritis,
African horse sickness, classical swine fever, and African
swine fever. Some of the damage caused by these
endotheliotropic
pathogens
can
be  attributed
【to
interference with the actions of the endothelium as the
permeability barrier between the bloodstream and soft
tissues.
.For
example,
the
widespread
dpetechial
haemorrhages in serous membranes and the leakage of
fluid into body cavities and perivascular tissues are due to
increased
permeability
of
capillaries. However, the
endothelium does much more than act as a passive barrier.
Endothelial  cell  activation is an  integral  part of acute
inflammation, a process in which the local microvascular
endothelial cells are both active participants and regulators
of the cellular and tissue responses (Pober and Sessa.
2007). Endothelial cells produce and release a variety of
mediators that are able to influence cellular and organ
function throughout the body.
The structure of capillary endothelial cells and the
mediators they release vary with anatomical location. The
vascular bed of an individual tissue is adapted to meet the
diverse needs of the tissues it supplies and it can express
molecules specific for those particular tissues. There is
considerable functional heterogeneity amongst endothelial
cells located in different vascular beds. The molecular
characteristics of the cells vary along the vascular tree.
This endothelial diversity may be a factor in the propensity
2112
of certain endothelio-tropic pathogens to target specific
regions of the vascular tree.
Endotheliotropic
 microorganisms 
maytargetthe
vasculature as a whole, or they may target a specific
vascular bed. Equine arteritis virus does not appear to
target a particular vascular bed. The virus causes
panvasculitis, characterized by inflammation of veins,
capillaries, lymphatics and arteries. Early lesions in veins,
capillaries and lymphatics are associated with oedema of
the ventral abdominal wall and the hind limbs. This is
         
medium-sized and small arteries throughout the body.
African horse sickness is a viral disease in which selective
vascular damage may be evident. Four forms of this
disease are recognized: the
mild horse sickness fever, the subacute cardiac form, the
mixed or cardiopulmonary form,  and the peracute
pulmonary form (Mellor and Hamblin, 2004 ). In horse
sickness fever, a condition usually involving only mild to
moderate fever and oedema of the supraorbital fossae, viral
antigen is found predominantly in the endothelial cells of
the spleen, with lesser amounts elsewhere, whereas, in the
peracute form of the disease, viral antigen is found
throughout the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems
(Behling-Kelly and Czuprynski, 2007).
and subsequent emboli. Thrombi in terminal arteries give
rise to ischaemia and infarction downstream, as is seen in
the  diamond-shaped   cutaneous  lesions caused by
Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae infection in pigs. Branches of
the renal arteries are prone to obstruction by emboli
2113
released from vegetative endocardiallesions. Sterile
emboli produce typical infarcts and infected emboli cause
abscesses. Infected emboli that obstruct interlobular
arteries or their smaller branches cause abscesses confined
to the renal cortex; those that block interlobar arteries
cause abscesses that occupy segments of both cortex and
medulla.

Interactions
ofmicrobial
 pathogens
withthe
musculoskeletal system
The musculoskeletal
system
has
well-recognized
mechanical functions: it provides support and protection
for body structures and it plays essential roles in
locomotion, respiration and mineral homeostasis. The
mechanical functions are executed by coordinated activity
of skeletal muscles, tendons, bones, cartilage, joints and
ligaments. Each of these diverse tissues has evolved
distinct biological properties and structural characteristics
in order to meet specific mechanical demands of avian and
mammalian species. Inevitably, the remarkable adaptation
of structure to mechanical function in the various tissues
impacts on the interactions of the host with microbial
pathogens and it has created the need for novel protective
and regenerative pathways to deal with the consequences
of host-pathogen encounters.
Responses of muscle to microbial pathogens
Although living muscle has been described as an
inhospitable site for microorganisms (Van Vleet and
Valentine, 2007), destruction of muscular tissue is a
feature of many infectious diseases of domestic animals.
including some that are life-threatening. Some viral
infections may induce foci of necrosis in skeletal and
cardiac muscle. In sheep, bluetongue virus damages
endothelial cells, resulting in micro-thrombi in small blood
vessels with oedema, focal haemorrhages and ischaemic
2116
necrosis of many tissues, including skeletal muscles and
the myocardium. Although these virus-induced changes
are defined as myositis (inflammation of muscle), they are
       
associated inflammatory response is secondary to muscle
damage. From a clinical perspective, the more important
microbial diseases of skeletal muscle are due to anaerobic
spore-forming bacilli of the genus Clostridium. Pathogenic
clostridia produce a number of toxins and enzymes that
damage muscles and give rise to life-threatening toxaemia.
However, the local muscular lesion is more accurately
defined as myonecrosis rather than myositis. The primary
lesion is necrosis of muscle fibres. Cytokines released
from  the degenerating  muscular tissue
recruit
inflammatory cells but, because of the distinctive structure
of skeletal muscle, most of these cells aggregate in the
interstitial tissue rather than in the muscle fibres.
Distinctive structural features of skeletal muscle
Skeletal muscles are composed of large numbers of
parallel myofibres bound closely together by a network of
connective tissue that forms part of the deep fascia. Each
muscle is enveloped by a sheath of dense fibrous
connective tissue called the epimysium. Fascia also
extends into the muscles from the inner surface of the
epimysium; as perimysium, it insulates muscle fibres into
bundles called fascicles and as endomysium it surrounds
individual fibres which it insulates from neighbouring
myofibres (Fig. 91.1).  Myofibres generate contractile
force, while the connective tissue acts as a supportive
matrix that accommodates the contractile elements and
takes part in the transmission of contractile force to
2117
adjacent myofibres and to tendons (Trotter and Purslow,
1992). The intimate association between myofibres and the
surrounding connective tissue is important for maintenance
of the integrity and proper function of the entire muscle
(Jarvinen et al., 2002).

The epimysium enveloping an entire muscle is in contact
with the sheaths of fascia that surround adjacent muscles
These smooth expanses of connective tissue provide
slippery surfaces that allow adjacent structures to move
s        s 
The potential space present between two sheaths of fascia
that abut upon each other is called a fascial plane. Distinct
fascial planes separate muscles in the limbs, the trunk, the
neck and the head. In each of these locations, the fascial
planes form natural cleavage lines within the muscular
masses, providing lines of least resistance to the spread of
transudate, extravasated blood, exudate, or bacteria. Thus.
fascial planes determine the direction in which an infection
may spread and, to an appreciable degree, they set the
anatomical boundaries to the resultant lesion. Pus and
other exudates gravitate to the most ventral region of a
fascial plane and that defines the probable location of an
emerging fistula or, alternatively, the most appropriate site
for elective surgical drainage.
The perimysium and endomysium constitute the interstitial
tissue through which blood vessels and nerves reach the
individual muscle fibres. The endomysium has two main
histological components (Fig.  91.1): discrete areas of
felt-like basal lamina that completely envelop each
independent myofibre, and the more diffuse, collagenous,
reticular lamina that fills the extracellular spaces between
all the basal laminae within the fascicle (Sanes, 2003).
Small arteries and arterioles that ramify throughout the
perimysium supply the capillaries in the reticular lamina.
The main course of the capillaries is parallel to the
myofibres, but they branch, anastomose and form an
extensive mesh around the muscle  cells. Thus. the
2119
endomysium is a richly vascular tissue with an extensive
system of anastomoses that provides the nutrients required
by active muscles and is capable of supplying adequate
numbers of inflammatory cells when and
where they are required. Even without the intervention of
pathogens, skeletal muscles require scavenger cells to
removecellular
debriswhen
 myofibres  undergo
degeneration following blunt trauma, sudden forceful
contractions, or unaccustomed vigorous activity. In these
circumstances, recruited monocytes become macrophages,
enter the necrotic myofibres and remove the cellular
debris. At the same time, the intact basal lamina is a
selective filter; it remains impermeable to fibroblasts and
to satellite cells and their progeny. The substantial
mechanical strength of the endomysium serves to protect
the myofibres from contraction-induced injury. Powerful
forces generated by the contractile elements are capable of
injuring and rupturing the lipid bilayer of the plasma
membranes of the myofibres, particularly during maximal
workload.  Transmembrane receptors  firmly  attach  the
lamina, and the tight physical attachment to the basal
lamina helps the cell membrane to retain its integrity and
to protect the myofibre from contraction-induced injury.
Each
mature
myofibre  is
along,  cylindrical.
multi-nucleated cell that  is packed with contractile
elements (myofibrils); approximately 80% of its volume is
Duance, 1990). The muscle progenitor cells are called
myoblasts. During the prenatal phase, myoblasts take one
of two developmental pathways: they can differentiate into
mature myofibres or they can remain as quiescent satellite
2120
cells that occupy positions on the surfaces of the
myofibres, between the plasma membrane and the
overlying basal lamina (McGeady et al., 2006). As the
nuclei of mature myofibres do not replicate, activated
satellite cells are the main source of myoblasts required fot
maintenance, hypertrophy, repair or replacement of mature
myofibres
The elongated myofibre is formed by end-to-end fusion of
many myoblasts, each of which contributes a post-mitotic
nucleus and a segment of cell membrane to the creation of
a tubular muscle cell. Subsequent development within the
myotubule involves the synthesis of specific contractile
proteins and the orderly array of the contractile elements
(actin and myosin) in myofilaments and myofibrils that is
responsible for the striations of skeletal muscle. In the
sarcoplasm of a mature myofibre, the nuclei are distributed
along the entire length of the fibre and each nucleus is
responsible  for  gene
expression in a segment of
sarcoplasm (nuclear domain) in its immediate vicinity
(Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008). As a consequence of
this functional arrangement, segments of a fibre can act
independently of other segments; commonly, when a
portion of a fibre becomes necrotic, adjacent viable
segments within that fibre continue to function normally.
Segmental distribution of structural damage is a distinctive
feature of injury to skeletal muscle.
Responses of muscle to injury
The major histopathological responses of skeletal muscle
to injury are necrosis of myofibres, infiltration by
inflammatory cells, regeneration of myofibres, and
2121
activation of fibroblasts in the intramuscular fascia. These
processes often extend into three overlapping phases: a
phase of degeneration, a phase of regeneration and a
remodelling phase.
The earliest evidence of the degeneration phase is necrosis
of myofibres. Most frequently, necrosis is segmental,
involving a number of contiguous sarcomeres within each
affected myofibre. The necrotic lesions may be induced by
exogenous factors, such as microbial toxins, or by
activation   of
f endogenous proteases  that degrade
myofibrillar and cytoskeletal proteins. The enzymes are
activated by a high concentration of intracellular calcium
ions, whether due to an influx of extracellular calcium
through a damaged plasma membrane or to an inability of
damaged  sarcoplasmic  reticulum  and mitochondria to
regulate intracellular transfer of ions.
Inflammatory cells are attracted to the site of injury by
proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and
TNF-o. These migrating cells invade the injured tissue
from the extensive mesh of small blood vessels that
encircles each affected muscle cell. The basal lamina does
not block the entry of the phago-cytic cells into the
myofibre. The initial response is an influx of neutrophils
followed
[ by monocytes
that
promptly
become
macrophages engaged in the removal of the necrotic
material, including remnants of the plasma membrane that
adhereto  the inner
 surface
eof the basallamina
Macrophages  specifically  target  the  necrotic  material
without damaging
the surrounding basal lamina or
associated satellite cells. When the necrotic debris has
been removed, the viable segments of myofibre proximal
2122
and distal to the lesion are linked by a hollow tube of basal
lamina that has not been degraded. This empty part of the
tube acts as a scaffold within which orderly regeneration of
the damaged myofibre can occur.
Since mature myofibres cannot replicate, the key cell
involved in regeneration of myofibres is the satellite cell.
These progenitor cells are present, in quiescent mode, on
the surface of mature myofibres between the plasma
membrane and the basal lamina. In necrotic myofibres.
satellite cells survive inside the hollow tube, where they
are activated when exposed to signals emanating from
injured muscle (Fig. 91.2). On activation, satellite cells
multinucleated myotubes that fuse with existing myofibres
to repair damaged regions or fuse with one another to form
new myofibres. The outcome can differ greatly depending
on whether or not the basal lamina is intact. When the tube
is ruptured, cells move in and out of it: satellite cells that
escape
1mto
interstitial
tissue
 form imdependent
non-functional muscle giant cells, while fibroblastic cells
that enter the tube lay down fibrous tissue that impedes or
completely restricts regeneration of myofibres within the
tube. When the hollow tube is intact, the activated satellite
cells use it as a scaffold to ensure that the new segments
intercalate with the proximal and distal viable segments,
reinstating the  structural  integrity and the functional
continuity of the myofibre. The new segments of myofibre
secrete their own basal lamina; the corresponding stretches
of the old tube are removed during the remodelling phase

Normally, the components of the granulation tissue laid

control system fails due to over-abundant production or
inadequate degradation of the extracellular matrix, a
fibrous scar results. Fibrosis of the intramuscular fascia
leads to a loss of strength and flexibility and predisposes to
recurring injury.

Responses of muscle to bacterial infection
Bacterial infection of skeletal muscle can be introduced by
the haematogenous route; for example, focal embolic
polymyositis is a feature of Histophilus somni infection in
lambs and of Actinobacillus eguuli infection in foals. More
commonly, bacterial pathogens enter the muscles via
penetrating wounds or intramuscular injections, or by
direct extension  from  suppurative lesions  in adjacent
structures such as tendon sheaths, joints, bones, or deep
fascia.The tissue

suppuration and necrosis of muscle fibres. This initial
lesion, an ill-defined cellulitis, may undergo resolution
with minor residual scarring; alternatively, it may expand
along fascial planes or it may be encapsulated as an
organized abscess. Spread along the fascial planes can give
rise to extensive damage and may result in one or more
fistulae emerging on the body surface, sometimes a
considerable distance from the original lesion. An abscess
in a muscle may heal slowly, or it may expand and
fistulate, in which case it either proceeds to heal by fibrosis
or it persists as a chronic granulomatous lesion and source
of continuousor  intermittent
discharge. In cats,
2125
Pasteurella multocida-infected bite wounds often result in
expanding cellulitis that leads to extensive destruction of
muscle fibres with accumulation of subcutaneous exudates,
especially below the level of the skin penetration The skin
puncture heals readily and, in the absence of adequate
drainage, abscesses and fistulae may form at the site
In horses, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis may cause
abscesses in various tissues and organs throughout the
body. The pyogenic responses of horses to this pathogen
are seen in three recognized clinical patterns: ulcerative
lymphangitis, extermal abscesses, and intermal abscesses.
Intramuscular abscesses fall into the external category. In
individual horses, the abscesses may be in a single site or
in multiple sites. They are frequently located in the
pectoral region and along the ventral midline of the
abdomen. The well-encapsulated abscesses may reach a
diameter of 15 to 20cm. The disease has been called
pigeon fever because the swollen pectoral muscles look
like a puffed-out pigeon breast. This disease is particularly
prevalent in the southern states of the USA. In the past,
this condition tended to occur as sporadic cases, often only
a single horse on a farm. In recent years, thousands of
horses have been affected in ‘epidemics' that have
extended the geographical regions in which the disease is
endemic (Spier, 2008). It is suspected that the pathogen
may be transmitted by arthropods since the incidence of
the disease fluctuates from year to year, greatly influenced
by   higher  than normal  seasonal rainfall  and other
conditions that favour high populations of insects
The pathogenicity of C. pseudotuberculosis has been
linked to the lipid coat that lies outside its cell wall and to
2126
the production of an exotoxin, phospholipase D (PLD)
Each of these bacterial products facilitates the survival of
the pathogens at the initial site of infection There, the early
innate inflammatory response is dominated by neutrophils
until macrophages take over as the more significant
phagocytic cells. The neutrophils that phagocytose the
pathogens at entry do not eliminate the infectious agent
because cytotoxic mycolic acid in the lipid coat of C.
pseudotuberculosis
causes
degenerative   changes  in
neutrophils. In addition 
the PLD toxinactivates
complement in the tissues surrounding the invading
bacteria, depleting complement locally  and reducing
opsonization of the bacteria (Yozwiak and Songer, 1993).
When macrophages engulf C. pseudotuberculosis, the lipid
coat protects the bacteria from the activity of the lysosomal
enzymes of the macrophages; the bacteria survive and
replicate as facultative intracellular pathogens. There is
continued expression of PLD by the intracellular C.
pseudotuberculosis, and this enzyme has been shown to
cause a small but significant reduction in the viability of
the host macrophages (McKean et al., 2007). When an
infected macrophage dies, it releases cellular debris and
viable corynebacteria, which act as a signal for another
cycle of phagocytosis, intracellular replication of C.
pseudotuberculosis, and death of phagocytes;the formation
of an abscess is set in train.
PLD toxin does not elicit any systemic sign of intoxication
rather, its activities are predominantly local. The primary
enzymatic function of PLD is to catalyse the dissociation
of sphingomyelin into ceramide phosphate and choline.
Hydrolysis of sphingomyelin  in host  cell membranes
results in leakage of aqueous contents and death of the cell.
2127
In endothelial cells PLD increases vascular permeability,
leading to leakage of plasma from blood vessels into the
surrounding tissues and, from there, into the lymphatic
channels. Thus, PLD acts as a permeability factor that
facilitates flow of fluid and the spread of pathogen-laden
macrophages to secondary sites of infection, including
skeletal muscles. Formation of an intramuscular abscess
that is palpable externally is a prolonged process in which
the cycle of phagocytosis, intracellular replication of C.
pseudotuberculosis, and death of phagocytes is repeated
many times.
Granulomatous lesions in skeletal muscle
Infectious granulomas in skeletal  muscle occur in
actinobacillosis,
actinomycosis,
botryomycosis and
tuberculosis. Nowadays, the prevalence of tuberculous
lesions in the musculature of cattle and pigs is extremely
low.In cattle, Actinobacillus lignieresii is a common cause
of pyogranulomatous lesions in the tongue. Timber tongue
(or   wooden   tongue)  is  a chronic pyogranulomatous
condition in which the skeletal
muscle fibres are displaced by an expanding mass of
fibrous tissue that contains a number of small loci of
pyogenic infection. Within the inflammatory locus, the
Gram-negative organisms are present as discrete colonies
in sulphur granules where they are surrounded by radiating
clubs, suspended in purulent debris, and encapsulated by
the fibrous tissue. The enlarged and rigid tongue interferes
with prehension and mastication Actinomyces bovis, the
bacterium  
 primarily
responsible for mandibular
osteomyelitis (lumpy jaw) in cattle, is an occasional cause
of similar granulomatous lesions in the tongue. On
2128
microscopy, a distinguishing feature is that the mass of
bacteria at the centre of the sulphur granule stains
Gram-positive in contrast to the Gram-negative reaction of
actinobacilli. Lesions due to Actinomyces bovis occur in
the masseter muscle and adjacent muscles 
as
a
consequence of invasion from contiguous osteomyelitis.
In the horse, granulomatous lesions of botryomycosis may
develop in the muscles of the neck and pectoral region as
an extension from a primary granulomatous dermatitis
caused
 by  a  persistent
low-grade
 infection
by
Staphylococcus
aureus.
Draft
horses seem
01
be
particularly  susceptible, 
presumably
because
the
staphylococci invade cutaneous abrasions caused by
harmess. The tissue reaction to invasion by the
staphylococci progresses to a hard nodular mass of fibrous
tissue that encloses a number of small abscesses which
may intercommunicate by sinuses and may drain to the
surface of the skin as fistulae
Necrotizing lesions in skeletal muscle
Some members of the genus Clostridium have a
predilection for skeletal muscle, in which they may
produce toxins and enzymes that damage the muscles and
give rise to clinical signs of toxaemia. The bacteria
involved are the histotoxic species Clostridium chauvoei,
C. septi-cum, C. perfringens, C. novyi and C. sordellii
These bacteria are widely distributed in nature, in the soil,
and in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals
Histotoxic clostridia produce a battery of exotoxins, most
of which act as extracellular enzymes that sustain the
bacteria during saprophytic life in the soil and during
2129
parasitic life in animal hosts. In skeletal muscles, the
clostridial exotoxins cause necrosis, oedema, haemorrhage
and gas formation. The major toxins of each clostridial
species have been assigned letters of the Greek alphabet,
with the letter o usually designating the most significant
toxin produced by that species. Because of this convention,
a given Greek designation is not intended to indicate that
toxins released by different species share the same
structure or mode of action. For instance, the two
pathogens isolated most often from myonecrotic lesions
express dissimilar α. toxins. There is no structural or
functional relationship between the pore-forming α toxin
of C. septicum and the α toxin of C. perfringens, a
cytolysin that hydrolyses phospholipid components of host
cell membranes.
The usual habitat of most of the clostridia is the soil from
which mammals acquire the pathogenic species by the oral
route or through traumatic injury. In either case, disease is
         
forms of the pathogens. The growth of the anaerobes and
the production of their toxins and enzymes are inhibited by
the high oxidation-reduction potential of normal tissues. In
the absence of an anaerobic environment, clostridial spores
remain dormant. There is evidence that some spores
acquired by the oral route may be disseminated by
macrophages and persist as dormant spores in liver, spleen
or skeletal muscle. These spores can be a source of
endogenous infection  when  changes in local conditions
allow them to germinate, multiply and produce toxins.
Dormant clostridial spores have been found in healthy
skeletal muscles in horses (Vengust et al., 2003), and
germination of these spores has been advanced as a
2130
probable explanation for the fact that many horses that
develop clostridial myonecrosis have a history of recent
intramuscular   injection    or    imadvertent
perivascular
injection of sterile medicinal products in the region of the
lesion (Peek et al., 2003). Dormant spores may be
activated also by non-penetrative trauma: for instance, the
initiating event in the pathogenesis of blackleg in young
unvaccinated cattle is muscle bruising and the associated
hypoxia that activates spores of C. chauvoei already
present in the muscles.
Dormancy also plays a role in the fate of clostridia
acquired from exogenous sources. It is probable that the
vast majority of traumatic wounds in domestic animals are
contaminated by a mixed flora that includes one or more
histotoxic clostridial
1 species, but anaerobic wound
infection develops in only a very small proportion of
injured animals. Tissue anoxia is the critical factor that
allows the anaerobes to grow in the wound. Hence, there
are three possible outcomes to the entry of histotoxic
clostridia. In the absence of the required anaerobic
conditions, the clostridia remain dormant, without clinical
evidence of their presence in the wound, until they are
eliminated by the defence mechanisms of the host. When
anoxic conditions prevail, the contamination rapidly
progresses to infection, tissue damage and toxaemia. The
microorganisms may proliferate and give rise to clostridial
cellulitis (malignant oedema), a toxaemic disease of the
integument in which lesions are limited to local skin and
subcutis without involvement of muscle, or they may
induce clostridial myonecrosis, a condition
in which there is progressive destruction of local muscle
mass in association with systemic signs of severe
2131
toxaemia. Clostridial cellulitis and clostridial myonecrosis
are diseases of ruminants, horses and pigs; they rarely
occur in carnivores. Clinical reports often use the term gas
gangrenetodescribe
eeither clostridial cellulitis  or
clostridial myonecrosis.
Clostridial cellulitis
Typically, clostridial cellulitis develops in a superficial
wound in which there is a modest amount of devitalized
tissue that has been contaminated with a polymicrobial
flora consisting of some histotoxic clostridial species
together with some aerobes and facultative anaerobes.
most of which are saprophytes with proteolytic and
putrefactive properties. Transition from contamination to
infection  is  facilitated by synergistic activities of the
saprophytes and the pathogens: in particular, proliferation
of the toxigenic anaerobes is promoted by the ability of the
facultative organisms to reduce the oxidation-reduction
potential within the wound. Much of the energy required
by the proliferating clostridia is made available by the
degradation of fascial proteins by the proteolytic enzymes
of the saprophytes. The anaerobes can diminish the
efficacy of the host's phagocytic cells, which facilitates the
proliferation of the non-toxigenic bacteria. Thus, the
accompanying saprophytes play a significant role  in
creating the local conditions that modulate the release of
toxins by the histotoxic clostridia. The quantity and
potency of toxins expressed by the pathogens can vary
between affected animals. The characteristic features of
clostridial cellulitis are severe oedema, crepitation due to
formation of gas, coldness of the affected part and signs of
toxaemia.
　The
accumulation
of
gas and
1the
2132
serosanguineous oedema fluid spread along fascial planes
but, in many cases, muscles are not damaged significantly,
even in fulminating toxigenic infections. However, if the
blood supply to a muscle is significantly impaired by the
initial trauma, or subsequently as a result of toxic injury to
the blood vessels,  the cellulitis may develop into
myonecrosis (Van Vleet and Valentine, 2007).
Clostridial myonecrosis
Clostridial myonecrosis arises most frequently in deep
traumatic wounds in which blood flow is compromised by
physical damage and by vasoconstriction of blood vessels
that supply the surrounding tissues, including muscles
include castration, shearing, penetrating stake wounds and
injuries to the female genitalia during parturition.
Contamination of such deep wounds is likely to introduce
a polymicrobial flora that includes histotoxic clostridia.
The traumatized tissues within the wound provide a ready
source of nutrients required for bacterial growth and the
compromisedblood
supply
creates
ananaerobic
environment that favours
proliferationofhistotoxic
clostridia and the release of necrotizing toxins. The
distinguishing  feature
of
myonecrosis is that these
clostridial toxins destroy healthy, living tissues. The initial
bacterial growth  within
 the devitalized tissues of the
wound generates the population of aggressive pathogens
that are capable of invading and destroying adjacent
healthy tissue. As a consequence of reduced blood flow,
hypoxic muscles contiguous to the wound switch to
anaerobic metabolism, produce lactic acid and reduce the
local pH, thus creating conditions favourable for
2133
colonization by clostridia from the primary wound. In
those
 circumstances,  proliferation
 of the clostridia
proceeds apace, triggering changes in the immediate
environment that are conducive to progressive extension of
tissue damage. Degradation of tissue is promoted by
bacterial proteases, by enzymes released from tissue
lysosomesand
by  clostridial
1exotoxins  Once the
destruction of muscle begins, the necrotic

progresses along the muscle with great speed, sometimes
at the rate of several centimetres per hour.
Clostridium septicum and C. perfringens type A,acting
alone or in combination with other species, are the
pathogens isolated most often from myonecrotic lesions.
C. perfringens occurs more frequently but C septicum
causes a more rapidly fulminating disease from which few
The tissue damage caused by these two organisms is
attributed to the α toxin of C. septicum (Kennedy et al.,
2005, 2009) and to the synergistic actions of the α and 0
toxins of C. perfringens type A (Awad et al., 2001).
Although the toxins expressed by the several histotoxic
species are very different in structure andin mode of
action,they cause
 similar   histopathological  lesions.
However, the histological features of full-blown clostridial
myonecrosis are markedly different from the characteristic
inflammatory lesions induced in softtissues by bacteria
such as staphylococci or streptococci. Typically, the local
tissue response to bacterial infection is dilatation of the
blood vessels and increased blood flow through the site of
infection, with exudation and emigration of leukocytes.
Remarkably, as clostridial myonecrosis develops, the flow
of blood through affected tissues undergoes an irreversible
2134
decline as does the number of leukocytes within the site of
infection. When histotoxic clostridia invade a fresh wound,
there is a transient phase during which the host mounts a
typical
inflammatory response; phagocytes engulf the bacteria but
it has been shown that engulfed C perfringens can escape
from the phagosomes and
1cansurvive withinthe
cytoplasm of macrophages, even under aerobic conditions
(O'Brien and Melville, 2000, 2004 ). This attribute may be
a decisive factor in the survival of contaminating
anaerobes when pathogen numbers are low in fresh
wounds. When anaerobic conditions suitable for clostridial
growth develop, the bacteria begin to multiply and to
secrete toxins responsible for progressive destruction of
adjacent muscle. The toxins induce changes in the local
vasculature that block the flow of blood into the lesion;
when incised, the affected muscle does not bleed.
Although pressure exerted by gas accumulating within the
muscular compartments enclosed tightly by fascia can
compromise blood flow through the smaller blood vessels,
interference with blood flow is due principally to the
formation  of occlusive aggregations of  platelets,
leukocytes and fibrin within the blood vessels. This leads
to ischaemic necrosis of healthy muscle fibres distal to the
occlusions, resulting
 in reduced  oxidation-reduction
potential and enhanced conditions for the rapid extension
of the disease process. The host’ s ability to limit the
toxin-induced absence of inflammatory cells from the
myonecrotic lesion. The toxins can impede the egress of
leukocytes from the incoming blood vessels and they can
destroy the inflammatory cells that enter the site of
infection. As a result, leukocytes accumulate within the
2135
blood vessels at the boundary between healthy and dead
tissues. Consequently, despite extensive necrosis of
muscular tissues and of the fascia and skin that overlie
them, leukocytes do not infiltrate the area of myonecrosis.
Thus, the histopathology of the affected muscles is
distinctive: necrosis and fragmentation of muscle fibres.
separation of degenerating fibres by copious quantities of
fluid and gas, absence of leukocytes within the
myonecrotic tissue, presence of leukocytes within fascial
planes and accumulation of leukocytes within blood
vessels at the boundary between the healthy tissues and the
myonecrotic tissues.

by extension from adjacent soft tissue lesions or following
accidental or surgical trauma. The patho-genesis of bone
infection can often be related to trauma. Research
biologists have reported that it is not easy to infect healthy
bone: they find that it is often necessary to damage bone
by physical or chemical means in order to reliably induce
pathological changes in an animal model. In intact healthy
bone, the mineralized component protects the underlying
soft tissues  from  colonization
bypathogens.  Open
contamination with soil, grit and pathogens. When an
animal is bacteraemic, blunt trauma increases the risk of
bone infection, in the absence of fracture or obvious
wound. Presumably, blood-borme pathogens preferentially
colonize bone where trauma has made binding sites on the
receptors. Certain
bacteria
 express
receptors
for
2136
components of osteoid matrix, such as collagen,
fibronectin, laminin and sialoglycoprotein. Bacteria that
infect bone must bind firmly to the host tissue, avoid host
defencesand
proliferate
situ.
 Forexample
Staphylococcus aureus has receptors by which it can bind
to collagen and sialoglycoproteins and, once bound, it
secretes a mucopolysaccharide glycocalyx to create a
biofilm which enhances adhesion, shields the pathogen
from the host defence mechanisms, and allows it to
proliferate. Host tissue reaction to proliferating pathogens
is greatly influenced by some structural features, including
the ongoing renewal of bone.
Anatomical considerations
Bone is a dynamic tissue in which structural renewal is a
constant feature: the biomechanical and metabolic
competence of the skeleton is dependent on its ability to
replace old and damaged bone by new bone as required.
The physiological turnover of old bone that occurs
periodically throughout life is described as remodelling. In
physiological circumstances, remodelling occurs when
osteoclasts resorb small packets of old bone and then
osteoblasts fill the resulting space with new bone. In this
way, there is internal replacement of the bone without
alteration in gross form or function. Significantly, this
also play a role when pathogens invade bones and joints.
A structural feature that distinguishes bone from other
forms of connective tissue is the calcified matrix that
occupies the intercellular spaces. In the presence of this
hard extracellular material, the local vasculature passes
2137
through designated channels within the osseous tissue. In
the cortex of long bones, there is a lattice of vascular
channels   consisting  of    haversian    canals
running
approximately parallel to the long axis of the bone and
transverse Volkmann canals that interlink with the
haversian canals and also communicate with  the
periosteum and with the marrow cavity. Afferent blood
vessels enter Volkmann canals at both periosteal and
endosteal surfaces.

Arterial blood is delivered to long bones by three systems
of vessels: periosteal arterioles, nutrient arteries and
metaphyseal-epiphyseal arteries (Fig. 91.3).
Terminal
branches of periosteal arterioles enter Volkmann canals in
subperiosteal cortical bone, taking a centripetal route to
supply the outer regions of the cortex. In contrast, nutrient
arteries, metaphyseal arteries and epiphyseal arteries enter
the medullary cavity  through  foramina that perforate
cortical bone. Within the medullary cavity, these afferent
vessels give off branches, some to supply tissues in the
2139
medullary cavity, others to produce thin-walled vessels
that enter portals of Volkmann canals on the endosteal
surface of the bone and travel centrifugally towards the
outer cortex.
Although the blood vessels present in the vascular
channels of compact bone are interposed between arteries
and veins, they are unable to behave as typical capillaries.
In soft tissues, capillaries are embedded in loose
connective tissue which allows the vessels to dilate to
mounts a local inflammatory response. Hyperaemia alters
intravascular pressure is alleviated by transfer of fluid to
interstitial spaces within the surrounding connective tissue.
In cortical bone, the thin-walled vessels are encircled by
only a slender sheath of supportive connective tissue
within the rigid canals and, as a consequence, the vessels
are incapable of effective dilatation when blood flow is
increased. Likewise, the small extravascular space between
the basement membrane of the endothelial cells and the
wall of the bony canal has only a limited capacity for
extravasated fluid. When cortical bone is inflamed, these
circulatory constraints give rise to vascular engorgement
and turbulent blood flow which, in turn, predispose to
thrombosis    and    associated    local    infarction.   These
pathological consequences tend to be more pronounced
when the infective agent releases a toxin that damages the
local endothelial cells
The architecture of the vascular system in the growth areas
of the long bones has a significant impact on the
localization of lesions in haematogenous osteomyelitis. In

it commonly begins in the epiphysis. In growing animals,
the metaphysis is separated from the epiphysis by the
growth plate, a thick plate of cartilage that separates the
vasculature of the two regions. The nutrient artery is the
principal source of blood to the metaphyses. When a
nutrient artery enters the medullary cavity, it divides into
an ascending branch and a descending branch. After each
of these medullary arterioles has given off a series of small
lateral branches that ramify in the vascular channels of the
cortical bone, it continues into the metaphysis, providing
anextensivenetworkof smallerarteriolesthatdonot
anastomose. These end-arterioles terminate in fenestrated
capillaries that allow blood-borme pathogens to escape into
the bone marrow. As the capillaries approach the growth
plate (Fig. 91.3), they form sharp hairpin bends and then
expand into large sinusoidal vessels that ramify in the
metaphy-seal area before draining into the nutrient vein.
Blood in the vascular loops and terminal vessels has a low
oxygen tension and the rate of flow through the sinusoids
is sluggish and turbulent, which favours the formation of
small intravascular thrombi within which bacteria are
sequestered from  circulating phagocytes. This enables
pathogens to survive, proliferate and induce inflammation.
By the time growth of a long bone has been completed, the
cartilage has been replaced by bone, a process known as
closure of the epiphysis. After closure, the metaphyseal
and epiphy-seal vessels communicate freely through the
closed growth plate and, consequently, blood-borne
pathogens  commonly  induce  primary  lesions  in  the
epiphyses of adult animals.

The histology of the periosteum helps to explain how
bacterial infection may lead to simultaneous occurrence of
degenerative and regenerative processes in an infected
bone. The periosteum consists of an outer fibrous layer and
an inner cellular layer.
.In long bones, the outer layer
provides bundles of collagen fibres that bind periosteum to
bone and it supplies
periosteal arterioles to the outer
regions of the cortex.

i. Trauma or other forms of injury which
displace the periosteum from
1 the surface of the bone
activate the quiescent osteoprogenitor cells, leading to
local formation of new bone. Because the attachment of
periosteum to bone is looser in growing animals than in
adults, this process of reactive osteogenesis is most evident
following infection in young animals. The most common
stimulus for this phenomenon is accumulation of exudate
2142
beneath the periosteum, a process that may occlude some
of the periosteal arterioles and result in segmental areas of
ischaemic necrosis in outer regions of cortical bone.
Reactions of bone to pathogens
In domestic animals, some bone infections may be caused
by fungal or viral pathogens but, in immature farm
animals, the majority are due to haematogenous spread of
bacteria from primary
lesions in the umbilicus, the
intestines or the respiratory tract. In these animals, the
common
causal
organisms
are
Arcano-bacterium
pyogenes, staphylococci, streptococci, Salmonella species
and Escherichia coli. The responses of skeletal tissues to
the pathogens are mediated by a number of cytokines,
some of which are continuously engaged in regulating the
activities of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in remodelling
mature bone (Fig. 91.4). In physiological circumstances,
osteoblasts are activated by IL-1 and TNF-o; in turn, the
activated cells secrete IL-6, IL-11 and prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) which activate osteoclasts. Osteoclasts degrade
bone matrix, releasing bone matrix proteins and TGF-β
which inhibit osteoclasts and stimulate production of
osteoblasts (Fig. 91.4). Then, the osteoblasts invade the
resorption site and begin the process of forming new bone
by secreting osteoid, the matrix in which minerals are
deposited. This process of bone turmover must be carefully
regulated to retain the structural features and the
biomechanical properties of the bone. In infected bone, the
reactive release of proinflammatory mediators, such as
TNF-α, IL-l and PGE2, by inflammatory cells can
uncouple the balance between resorption and formation of
bone. Thus, bacterial infection of bone may lead to local
2143
destructive lesions, to local proliferative lesions, or to a
combination of both.
       
inflammatory reaction in the soft tissues of bone, that is, in
the periosteum, in the connective tissue in the vascular
canals or in the bone marrow. The inflammation may
begin in the medullary cavity as osteomyelitis or it may
begin in the periosteum as periostitis. However, the
extensive connections between the blood vessels in the
periosteum,the
vascular canals and the bone marrow provide routes by
which progressive inflammation can extend to involve all
three sites. In each of these locations, there is little room
for expansion to accommodate inflammatory exudate. In
the medullary cavity and the vascular canals, exudate is
confined by rigid bone. The presence of the fluid and the
cellular components of the inflammatory exudate within
the marrow cavity increases intramedullary pressure,
which can compress branches of the nutrient arteries,
resulting in thrombosis and infarction of haematopoietic
marrow and of trabecular bone. As the pressure rises, it
can force exudate from the medullary cavity into the
vascular channels and through the cortex to the external
surface of the bone. Exudate percolating along the vascular
channels impedes the flow of blood to cortical bone and, in
spite of numerous anastomoses, the small vessels in the
rigid    channels   do  not
providesufficientcollateral
circulation to prevent segmental ischaemic necrosis within
the mineralized compact bone. On emergence at the
external surface of the bone, exudate can undermine the
attachment of periosteum to bone. If the exudate is trapped
between the bone and the periosteum, a subperiosteal
2144
abscess develops; if the periosteum ruptures, inflammation
spreads to the surrounding soft tissues and, in due course,
the exudate may be discharged at the body surface via
sinus tracts.
Thus, the main features of acute inflammation in bone are
trapping of exudate in restricted spaces and the associated
pressure effects on local vasculature that predispose to
infarcts both in the medullary cavity and in mineralized
bone. These factors, combined with the actions of bacterial
toxins and enzymes, lead to necrosis of avascular
fragments of bone. When necrosis is extensive, a segment
of dead bone may separate from the living bone as a
sequestrum, a bony corpse in a pool of purulent exudate.
Later, the host may attempt to wall off the sequestrum in a
sheath of granulation tissue, and in turn this is transformed
into a sheath of new bone known as an involucrum. Small
foci of necrotic bone may be resorbed slowly over time but
larger infected segments persist as sequestra, foci of
chronic osteomyelitis from which the pathogens cannot be
       
antibiotics. Even when pathogens are inactive, the necrotic
bone acts as a foreign body that interferes with the healing
process. Pathogens may persist as inactive residents. For
instance, some strains of Staphylococcus aureus can
survive for long periods within osteoblasts and endothelial
cells before they re-emerge as active pathogens. Some of
these strains have the characteristics of smallcolony
variants (SCVs) that grow very slowly on culture and yield
small, non-pigmented, non-haemolytic colonies. In vivo,
SCVs display a very slow metabolic rate, an enhanced
ability to persist within host endothelial cells, and strong
resistance to antibiotics. In human patients, SCVs have
2145
been associated with chronic osteomyelitis that was
resistant to prolonged antimicrobial therapy, and also with
chronic relapsing osteomyelitis, often with long periods of
quiescence between episodes.
Atrophic rhinitis
Bacterial toxins can damage turbinate bones (conchae) in
the nasal cavities of young pigs. A heat-labile cytotoxin
released by specific strains of Bordetella bron-chiseptica is
capable of inducing non-progressive, moderately severe
atrophic lesions of the conchae. The clinical signs are mild
and the host is able to spontaneously regenerate the
damaged bones. However, it is believed that the strains of
B.bronchiseptica that produce the cytotoxin may
bacterium that causes progressive atrophic rhinitis, a
diseaseinwhich
1  there  is severe,  progressive and
irreversible damage to the conchae. The cause of the
lesions of progressive atrophic rhinitis has been identified
P. multocida, predominantly strains of serotype D, less
commonly strains of serotype A (Chanter et al., 1986)
Clinical signs include sneezing, nasal discharge, deformity
of the snout, and failure to thrive. The pathognomonic sign
is a shortening or twisting of the snout due to disruption of
the normal processes of remodelling of the turbinate bones.
The activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are uncoupled:
the formation of bone by osteoblasts is inhibited and the
resorption of bone by osteoclasts is increased. It is
suggested that Pasteurella multocida toxin does not
directly affect the osteoclasts; rather, it stimulates
osteoblasts to release soluble mediators (cytokines and
2146
prostaglandins) that regulate the activities of the
osteoclasts (Dominick and Rimler, 1988). In severe cases,
the conchal bones may be destroyed completely.
Actinomycosis
Actinomycosis is a chronic granulomatous condition most
commonly seen as ^lumpy jaw' in cattle. The causal agent.
Actinomyces bovis, is a normal inhabitant of the
the deeper tissues of the jaw through wounds of the buccal
bodies. Infection may also occur by direct extension from
the gums through dental alveoli, particularly in young
animals in which teeth
are erupting. In the majority of cases the disease affects the
mandible; it occurs in the maxilla less frequently. In the
mandible, the disease expands progressively from an initial
small swelling of the bone, often located at the level of the
central molar teeth. In the bone, Actinomyces bovis invades
the medullary cavity where it elicits a pyogranulomatous
inflammatory reaction: the cavity is filled with granulation
        s
suppurative tracts. Colonies of the microorganism are
present in ^sulphur granules' in the pus and embedded in
the granulation tissue. In actinomycosis, the ‘sulphur
granule’ consists of a mass of tangled, Gram-positive
filaments surrounded by club-shaped red-staining bodies.
The structure of the affected bone undergoes extensive
changes as is evident when a macerated preparation of the
swollen segment is examined. The gross swelling is due to
the excess trabecular bone laid down when osteoprogenitor
cells in the periosteum are activated. This new bone and
2147
the adjacent old bone are perforated by cavities created by
advancing suppurative tracts. As a result, the bony lesion
has a sponge-like structure. Thus, the lesion caused by
Actinomyces bovis is a rarefying form of osteomyelitis.
The infection may extend from bone to adjacent soft
tissue, spread along fascial planes, and discharge pus
containing
sulphur granules through the  mucous
         
and consequently the animal has difficulty with prehension
and with mastication.
Vertebral osteomyelitis
Inflammation  of vertebral bodies can develop from
penetrating wounds or from infections in adjacent tissues,
including intervertebral discs, but it is likely that most
cases result from haematogenous dissemination of bacteria
as septic emboli from primary lesions in the umbilicus or
in any of several organ systems. Vertebral osteomyelitis
may be secondary to navel-ill in calves and foals, to
metritis, mastitis, and traumatic peritonitis in cattle, to
tail-biting in piglets, and to tail-docking in pups. The
disease is seen most commonly in neonatal animals,
presumably in those with inadequate passive immunity.
Arcanobacterium pyogenes is a common causative agent in
several species but a range of other bacteria may be
involved. In one study, Salmonella Dublin was isolated
from the vertebral lesion in eight of 10 calves that had
presented with cervico-thoracic osteomyelitis (Healy et al.,
1997). In pigs, discospondylitis occurs in association with
polyarthritis caused byErysipelothrix rhusiopathiae
Vertebral osteomyelitis often leads to destruction and
2148
collapse of the affected vertebra, compression of the spinal
cord and sudden onset of neurological signs.
Responses of joints to microbial pathogens
Many bacteria, viruses and fungi have been isolated from
infected joints of domestic animals. Infectious arthritis is
common in horses and in farm animals, often as a sequel to
neonatal bacteraemia in young animals that have not
absorbed
an
adequate
quantity
of
colostral
immunoglobulins. In very young animals, bacteria that
 s       
the nasopharynx, in the intestines, or in the umbilicus
frequently settle in richly vascular synovial membranes.
The resultant arthritis may be part of a systemic disease
that causes lesions in several other organs and tissues. In
other instances, the secondary lesions may appear to be
restricted to the skeletal system, commonly in more than
one joint; it is not always evident whether this is because
the joints are the only secondary sites affected or because
the disease has persisted in joints after it has been cleared
from other sites (Thompson, 2007 ). In general, arthritis
occurs in young animals as an acute disease involving
several joints simultaneously, whereas in mature animals it
tends to be a chronic degenerative disease, commonly in a
single joint. In both situations, the development of the
articular lesions reflects the interrelationships between the
several structural components of the joint and, also, the
distribution of forces between the joint and the
subchondral tissue of the articulating bones.
Anatomical considerations
2149
In a typical synovial joint, the ends of two opposing bones
are covered by hyaline cartilage, separated by a thin layer
of synovial fluid, and held in position by a cuff of dense
fibrous tissue, the joint capsule (Fig. 91.5). The capsule is
lined by a synovial membrane which is attached at the
margins of the articular cartilage but does not encroach on
the surface of the cartilage. In some recesses of the joint.
this membrane has many very small villous projections.
The membrane consists of two layers which are not
separated by a basement membrane: a thin intimal layer of
synovial cells (synoviocytes), and a subintimal layer of
richly vascular connective tissue. The intimal layer
phagocytic cells, which can engulf and remove cell debris
and waste material from the joint cavity, and type B cells.
which release several products into the synovial fluid,
including the surface-active phospholipid which is the
principal lubricant in healthy joints at low loads. Type B
cells also produce collagen and other constituents of the
intimal interstitium. Both cell types produce a number of
mediators, including TNF-o and interleukin-1.

cartilage
Under normal physiological conditions, the articular
cartilage provides an almost frictionless and wearresistant
surface for the transmission and distribution of mechanical
         
articular  cartilage
firmlyto subchondralbone. The
subchondral plate to which the cartilage is bound is many
times more deformable than cortical bone, thus allowing
more even distribution of the mechanical load between the
cartilage and the bone at times of peak mechanical loads
(Thompson, 2007). Structurally, the articular cartilage is a
matrix composed of collagen fibres in a proteoglycan gel
that contains a widely dispersed population of isolated
chondrocytes, cells that are responsible for the production
of the matrix. Chondrocytes regulate their activities in
response to mechanical signals and to molecular signals,
2151
such as growth factors, chemokines and cytokines
(Goldring and Marcu, 2009). Chondrocytes are able to
produce many of these mediators, which then act as
autocrine or paracrine messengers. The matrix does not
contain blood vessels, lymphatic vessels or nerves.
Chondrocytes depend on the diffusion of nutrients from
synovial fluid through the matrix. The extracellular matrix
is approximately 70% to 80% water, which enables it to
act as a resilient cushion at the weight-bearing surface of
the joint. At high mechanical loads, water is forced out of
the matrix into the synovial fluid, forming a layer of
hydrodynamic lubrication between the opposing cartilages.
When the pressure is released, water returns into the
cartilage by osmotic traction within the matrix.
In contrast to ongoing turnover of bone, remodelling of
articular cartilage occurs at a very slow rate. In mature
animals, natural remodelling of articular cartilage is based
the matrix rather than on renewal of chondrocytes or
collagen fibres. The majority of the degradative enzymes
are secreted by chondrocytes as inactive precursors that are
activated when cleaved by other enzymes in the matrix.
Also in the matrix there are specific enzyme inhibitors
which help to regulate the activities of the degradative
enzymes.Inhealthy
articular cartilage, turnover of
proteoglycan isvery
slowand strictlyregulatedto
maintain a balance between enzymatic degradation and
replacement. The pace of remodelling is increased in
response to mechanical injury, to changes in mechanical
loading, and to molecular signals, including chemokines
and cytokines released in infected joints.
2152
Responses of joints to bacterial pathogens
Pathogens can enter joints by the haematogenous route,
through wounds, by extension from adjacent bone or by
extension from periarticular soft tissues. Invasion of the
joint evokes an inflammatory response: increased blood
flow, increased permeability of capillaries to fluid and
cells, and recruitment of inflammatory cells, initially
neutrophils, later
monocytes
and
lymphocytes
Inflammation restricted to the synovium is described as
synovitis. The term arthritis implies that the capsule and
articular cartilage are inflamed; osteoarthritis is the
appropriate term when the inflammation has extended to
involve bone. Damage to intra-articular structures may be
due to toxins released by the pathogens, to the
inflammatory process, to proteolytic enzymes released
from cartilage or synovial tissues, to persistence of
microbial antigens in the joint, or to the failure of
degenerating chondrocytes to maintain the proteoglycan
content of the articular cartilage.
The acutely inflamed joint is hot, swollen and painful
because of the hyperaemia, the oedema of the synovial
membrane and of the joint capsule and the increased
volume of synovial fluid. The exudate may be fibrinous,
purulent or seropurulent. As the arthritis progresses,
oedema of the synovial tissues becomes less apparent but
the joint capsule and the synovial membrane become
thicker due to proliferation of stromal cells and
synoviocytes. Particulate matter released within the
affected joint is engulfed by type
A synoviocytes. The debris-laden phagocytes can persist
for extended periods in the subintimal layer. When a joint
2153
is severely affected, many of these synoviocytes may
accumulate within the synovial membrane and stimulate a
fibrotic reaction in the joint capsule. The synovial villi
enlarge and may branch extensively; they contribute to the
granulation tissue that spreads across the articular cartilage
as a pannus, cutting off the underlying cartilage from the
nutrients in synovial fluid. This is one of several negative
influences that contribute to degeneration of the articular
cartilage, the major consequence of microbial invasion of a
synovial joint.
Because it is an avascular structure, articular cartilage
cannot mount a typical inflammatory reaction but it is
affected by inflammation in the synovium, capsule or
subchondral bone. Articular cartilage generally remains
intact in fibrinous arthritis, except in areas where it is
covered by pannus. In purulent (septic) arthritis, the
cartilage may undergo extensive destruction on exposure
to collagenases and other lysosomal enzymes released
from degenerating neutrophils. At the molecular level, the
cartilageresponds
to
a
a repertoireofinflammatory
mediators from
1intra-articular
les1ons
andfrom
chondrocytes located within the cartilage itself.  The
mediators, including those that act as autocrine and
paracrine messengers, stimulate the chondrocytes to
produce proteolytic enzymes that contribute to destruction
of the cartilage matrix; they inhibit the synthesis of the
major physiological inhibitors of these enzymes and they
also inhibit synthesis of new matrix.  The resultant
imbalance between degradation and replacement results in
a net loss of matrix. The cartilage becomes thin and
develops  superficial  fissures;  hydrodynamic  lubrication
becomes less efficient. Progressive erosion of the articular
2154
cartilage brings the subchondral ends of the bones into
contact and, as a result, the two opposing surfaces are
polished by friction, become extremely hard and acquire
an ivory-like appearance  (eburmation).  The  stiffness
associated with this sclerosis of the subchondral bone may
reduce the ability of the bone to absorb and redistribute
mechanical loads through the joint, thus increasing the
load on the damaged cartilage and hastening its
destruction. A focus of inflammation in the subchondral
bone can remove the support on which the cartilage rests,
leading to collapse of the articular surface and
degeneration of the cartilage. This sequence of events
occurs in Mycoplasma bovis infection in cattle, and in
chronic Erysipelothrix rhusio-pathiae infection in sheep.
Although Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is responsible for
chronic arthritis in pigs, it is not always possible to isolate
the organism from affected joints. In such cases,
persistence of inflammatory changes in the joints may be
due to the presence of bacterial antigens in the synovial
tissues. Specific antibodies to these antigens have been
detected in synovial fluid of chronically arthritic joints,
presumably produced by the many plasma cells present in
the hypertrophic synovial villi
In septic arthritis, development of adhesions between the
surfaces of the two bones interferes with mobility of the
joint and may eventually lead to obliteration of the joint
cavity and fixation of the joint by connective tissue,
cartilage or osseous tissue. Osseous union of the bones
prevents movement as the joint becomes ankylosed.

economic loss in farm animal production. The relative
importance of foot lameness in various species differs; it is
especially important in cattle and sheep. Footrot caused by
infection with Dichelobacter nodosus and other bacterial
pathogens is a major cause of lameness in sheep. Relative
to sheep, infections of the foot in dairy cows are less
common. Although foot lameness in farm animals is
mainly attributable to bacterial infections, it is also a
significant clinical feature in a number of important viral
diseases in which pedal lesions develop (Table 91.1).
Lesions can develop in locations other than the foot in
these systemic viral diseases. In contrast, bacterial
infections which induce lameness are usually limited to
pedal tissues. Bacteria that affect the skin and horn of the
digit in farm animals include Fusobacterium necrophorum,
Arcanobacterium
pyogenes,
Porphyromonas
and
Prevotella species, organisms which are often normal
inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract. Virulent strains of
Dichelobacter nodosus, the primary cause of footrot in
sheep, are not regarded as commensals. These pathogenic
strains are maintained by clinically-affected and recovered
carrier sheep. Observations on the epidemiology of digital
dermatitis in cattle also suggest that the putative causative
organisms are maintained by carrier animals which can
introduce infection into clean herds
The aetiology and epidemiology of infectious digital
disease are complex, and definitive diagnosis is difficult
Isolation of anaerobic and other bacteria from pedal
2156
lesions is demanding, and specific procedures must be
followed (see Chapter 37). Moreover, contamination by
opportunistic bacteria may render interpretation of the
significance of isolates difficult. Infectious foot conditions
of sheep and cattle and their associated aetiological agents
are listed in Tables 91.2 and 91.3, respectively. The
aetiological role of the bacteria commonly isolated from
digital lesions is well established for some conditions but
is unclear in others; the primary role of Dichelobacter
nodosus in the aetiology of footrot in sheep is not disputed
whereas its role in interdigital dermatitis is uncertain. In
addition, synergism between two or more organisms is
important in the aetiology of many foot conditions as
illustrated by the relationship between F. necrophorum and
D. nodosus in ovine footrot and between F. necrophorum
and Porphyromonas levii in foul-in-the-foot (interdigital
necrobacillosis) in cattle.

Ovine footrot
Two clinical forms of footrot, virulent and benign,
apparently relate to the invasiveness of the strain of
Dichelobacter nodosus involved. Although D. nodosus is
the principal pathogen in ovine footrot, other organisms
are commonly associated with the condition (Table 91.2)
The bacterium largely responsible for the initiation of
2160
footrot is Fusobacterium necrophorum, which causes
tissue necrosis with a subsequent inflammatory reaction.
Damage to the interdigital skin as a result of constant
wetting and infection with Arcanobacterium pyogenes are
also involved in lesion development. The local anaerobic
microenvironment facilitates infection with D. nodosus
which possesses pili, allowing adherence to the epithelium
of the foot. If the strain of D. nodosus has poor keratolytic
activity, limited separation of horm from underlying matrix
may occur at the heel. This benign form of footrot
manifests as slight lameness which rapidly regresses after
topical treatment or with the onset of dry weather. Virulent
strains of D. nodosus cause extensive separation of horn
from underlying matrix, extending from the heel to the
sole and toe, with the formation of a foul-smelling necrotic
exudate. Lameness, which is severe and persistent, usually
involves more than one foot. Adult sheep are more
commonly affected than lambs and the Merino breed
appears to be more susceptible than other breeds.
Dichelobacter nodosus,a
1Gram-negative
anaerobic
bacterium, is an obligate pathogen of the feet of
clinically-affected  or chronic carrier ruminants.  The
organism can survive in warm, wet, muddy environmental
conditions for up to 7 days. In summer, survival of the
pathogen is favoured by grazing on lush pastures and wet
underfoot conditions enhance survival when sheep are
housed in winter. Both of these environmental situations
can contribute to maceration of interdigital skin. For
transmission to occur, daily mean temperatures must
exceed 10°C.
2161
Diagnosis of footrot is based primarily on clinical
examination. A number of scoring systems have been
devised to aid in the characterization and control of the
disease
(Whittington
and
1Nichols，1995).If
microbiological confirmation of the strain virulence of D.
nodosus is required, biochemical tests for virulence
attributes can be used. However, tests for elastase
production and gelatin liquefaction can take from 1 to 5
weeks to complete and are, therefore, of retrospective
value only. Newer diagnostic methods based on PCR and
detection of specific DNA products can be used for rapid
detection of virulent and benign strains (Liu and Webber,
1995 ). Rapid detection of strain virulence is important
because clinical differentiation between
benign footrot and the early manifestations of the virulent
form of the disease may be difficult
Extensive studies on the control of footrot were carried out
in Australia. They included comparisons of the economic
return from different control options (Egerton et al., 1989 ;
Egerton and Raadsma, 1991). Control strategies are
available including topical  treatment of affected feet,
identification and elimination of virulent strains of D.
nodosus, vaccination and genetic selection for improved
resistance to footrot. The conventional method of
treatment and control of footrot is paring of affected feet to
remove separated horn and establish drainage. This is
followed by topical application of antibacterial solutions
such as 10% to 20% zinc sulphate or 5% oxytetracycline
solution. This method of treatment is labour intensive and
is often replaced by the use of a foot bath, usually after
separation of affected sheep from the rest of the flock
2162
Carriers of benign strains of D. nodosus cannot be
identified as the interdigital skin remains normal and they
do not develop lameness. Footrot has been eliminated from
parts of Australia where control programmes involving the
culling of carrier sheep have been set up. Culling takes
place during the hot, dry spring/summer period when
transmission of D. nodosus cannot occur. Elimination of
footrot from other geographical regions which do not have
consistent periods of hot, dry weather does not appear to
be feasible (Green and George, 2008).
Although naturalinfection with D. nodosus confers no
appreciable immunity, vaccination can increase short-term
resistance and is a useful adjunct to control and treatment.
The antigens which evoke a protective immune response
 snsou 'a o sdnos o ul an aau ld a
immunity develops to the homologous strain only.
Knowledge of the serogroups prevalent in a flock is
essential when selecting a vaccine. The vaccines currently
available are inactivated.  Although  vaccines  usually
contain a number of different strains from the serogroups
most commonly associated with footrot, protection cannot
always be assured, even when the serogroups present in a
flock are matched with those in a vaccine. Transformation
of one serogroup of D. nodosus to another, which has been
shown to occur in vitro, is a possible explanation for
apparent vaccination failure in some cases (Wani and
Samanta, 2006). Vaccination can be used therapeutically to
reduce the severity and duration of infection. Two
injections of vaccine are necessary.
Genetic selection may be aimed at increased resistance to
virulent strains of D. nodosus. Alternatively, strategies
2163
might be directed towards increasing responsiveness to
vaccination.  Although   considerable   information 
1S
available on the genetic basis of susceptibility to footrot in
Merino sheep, the practical application of selection for
either increased resistance or responsiveness to vaccination
has not yet been achieved.
Ovine interdigital dermatitis
In this mild disease, inflammation is confined to the
interdigital skin. Fusobacterium necrophorum, which is
the principal pathogen, invades the epidermis following
maceration of the skin due to wet conditions underfoot or
following local
1 injury. The interdigital skin is
erythematous and swollen, and there may be superficial
greyish discoloration. Lameness is not usually apparent,
and affected animals recover when underfoot conditions
improve.  Ovine  interdigital dermatitis  is  clinically
indistinguishable from benign footrot.
Contagious ovine digital dermatitis
This is a newly described condition which has been
recognized in only a few countries worldwide, principally
in the UK (Winter, 2008). It can be distinguished from
other extremely virulent forms of footrot because
ulcerative lesions appear first on the coronary band and
interdigital lesions are not evident. The lesion progresses
down the hoof wall, causing separation of the horn from
the sensitive laminae and frequently resulting in complete
separation of the hoof hom, leaving a raw stump. The
aetiology of the condition is uncertain but treponemes
were isolated from clinically affected hooves more
2164
frequently than from healthy feet (Moore et al., 2005). The
organisms have been identified as T. phagedenis-like and
T. medium / T. vincenti- like (Sayers et al., 2009) and are
similar to those isolated from digital dermatitis lesions in
cattle (Evans et al., 2008). Strains of D. nodosus similar to
those isolated from cases of virulent ovine footrot have
A       s  o
contagious ovine digital dermatitis (Moore et al., 2o05).
Thus, the role of the bacterial organisms associated with
this condition and of other factors which may contribute to
disease development is currently unclear.
Opportunistic suppurative conditions of the foot
In sheep, lamellar abscessation can occur at the heel or the
toe. Horn defects may allow opportunistic infection which
usually includes F. necrophorum and A. pyogenes.
Increased weight in late gestation predisposes
to heel abscessation in ewes. Extension of infection from
ovine interdigital dermatitis may predispose to infection of
the second interphalangeal joint. When abscess formation
occurs at the toe, infection is usually confined to the
corium of the hoof without joint involvement.
In cattle, lamellar abscessation is frequently termed white
line disease. Infection of defective horn by opportunistic
bacteria may occur at any point on the white line. In dairy
cattle, the condition often affects the lateral claw of a hind
foot. This site is particularly susceptible to a combination
of mechanical stress and subclinical laminitis which may
predispose to disruption of horn structure, facilitating entry
of pyogenic bacteria. The subsequent suppurative process
2165
coronary band or at the skin/horn junction of the heel. If
left untreated the inflammatory process may involve the
deeper tissues of the foot leading to septic arthritis of the
second interphalangeal joint.
In pigs, lamellar abscessation (bush foot) occurs when
traumatic lesions of the white line or the sole become
infected. Trauma, due to rough floor surfaces, produces
erosions of the horn and haemorrhage in almost 1oo% of
intensively reared piglets. These minor lesions do not
cause lameness unless they become infected and there is
subsequent extension to the sensitive laminae. Progression
of infection may be similar to that observed in other
species with discharge at the coronary band. Serious
sequelae such as arthritis and tenosynovitis can also occur.
Bovine interdigital necrobacillosis
This condition, which is also kmown as foul-in-the-foot or
footrot, is an acute or subacute necrotizing interdigital
dermatitis (Table 91.3). The infection results in necrosis
with fissure formation in the interdigital skin and a
purulent exudate. Extension of the process to underlying
soft tissues is characterized by swelling. There is
considerable pain and lameness. The tissue damage is a
consequence of the synergistic action of F. necrophorum
and Porphyromonas levii, formerly known as Bacteroides
melaninogenicus subspecies levii (Berg and Loan, 1975;
Berg and Franklin, 2000 ). In common with other bacterial
infections of the digital skin and horn, predisposing factors
are considered important in the pathogenesis of interdigital
necrobacillosis Trauma, maceration of the skin after
prolonged wetting, and nutritional deficiencies have been
2166
suggested as important contributory factors in the
development   of 
the
  condition. Bovine  interdigital
necrobacillosis usually affects one foot and extension to
thesecond
1  inter-phalangealjoint   may occur. A
par-ticularly severe form of the disease, termed ‘super
foul', in which there is rapid development of necrosis and
Cutler, 1995 ). Response to antibiotic therapy is poor.
Isolates of F. necrophorum from these severe lesions are
extremely virulent (Berg and Franklin, 2000 ). A possible
     s   s
affected with ‘super foul'. Spirochaetes were observed in
lesions but their aetiological role was not clearly defined
(Doherty et al., 1998). Systemic antimicrobial therapy is
the usual treatment for interdigital necrobacillosis although
lesions may resolve without treatment. Early and sustained
treatment is required for ‘super foul', including local
debridement of necrotic tissue and high doses of parenteral
antibiotics for 5 days.
Bovine digital dermatitis
This condition was first described in Italy in 1974.
Inflammatory lesions occur in the interdigital skin and may
extend to the coronet. Two forms of the disease, erosive
and verrucose, may reflect different stages in its
development. The degree of lameness is variable and, on
palpation, lesions may be tender. The aetiology of digital
dermatitis is multifactorial. A number of infectious agents
and environmental factors appear to be associated with the
development of the disease. The condition is frequently
seen in first-calved heifers. There may be an increase in
the occurrence of the disease in loose-housed herds when
2167
conditions are unhygienic. The prevalence of the disease
usually decreases when animals are at pasture.
Current evidence supports the hypothesis that spirochaetes
have an aetiological role despite the absence of definitive
experimental proof. Many of the spirochaetes which have
been implicated appear to be closely related to human oral
treponemes, and several
1different
t   phylotypes   are
frequently present in a single animal (Klitgaard et al., 2008
). In addition to their presence on the surface of lesions,
treponemes can be
found deep within the dermis,
supporting the suggestion that they have an aetiological
role in lesion 
development. Affected cattle produce
anti-treponemal antibody, and treponemes isolated from
digital dermatitis lesions are capable of inducing abscess
formation in mice (Demirkan et al., 1999; Elliott et al.,
2007). Other bacteria isolated from the lesions include F.
necrophorum, Prevotella species, Porphyromonas species
and Peptostreptococcus(Peptoniphilus)indolicus(Dopfer,
2000 ). Topical applications of antibiotics are used for
treatment. Herd outbreaks can be treated with antibiotic
solutions, usually of lincomycin, erythromycin
1or
oxytetracycline, in footbaths, although legislative
(Laven and Logue, 2006).
Bovine interdigital dermatitis
Dichelobacter nodosus is considered to be the principal
aetiological agent in this condition. The strains involved
differ from those that cause virulent footrot in sheep. In
several investigations, D. nodosus was not isolated from
the lesions; a number of anaerobes including F.
2168
necrophorum and Prevotella species were isolated and
spirochaetes were demonstrated in the pedal lesion. Digital
and   interdigital  dermatitis may  be closely related.
Lameness is uncommon in bovine interdigital dermatitis
Footbaths containing formalin or copper sulphate are used
as part of a control programme.

The role of microbial pathogens in diseases of the
integumentary system
The skin is an extensive and versatile barrier between the
essential role in many of the homeostatic adjustments that
make it possible for mammals to survive on land. Skin has
a vital role in the regulation of body temperature. The skin
pigment, melanin, protects the tissues from injury by
ultraviolet light. The keratinized external surface of the
skin limits the loss of fluid by evaporation from the body
surface.The keyrole playedby
the epidermis in
life-threatening losses that occur when burns denude
extensive areas of the keratinized layer. Skin offers a
significant mechanical and chemical barrier to the entry of
microorganisms and it contributes to an effective immune
response when pathogens breach that barrier. Each of these
functions is dependent on adaptations of histological
structure that enable the skin to make the necessary
homeostatic adjustments.
Structural and functional perspectives
The skin is composed of epithelial and connective tissue
elements in two distinct but mutually dependent zones: the
epidermis and the dermis. The two zones are separated by
the basement membrane, a complex structure that anchors
the epidermis to the underlying dermis and also serves as a
semipermeable filter that selectively permits passage of
2176
fluids and cells in either direction. This is an extremely
important property, because the
blood vessels and
lymphatics that supply nutrients to the dermis do not
extend across the basement membrane. Sweat glands, hair
follicles and associated sebaceous glands extend into the
dermis as downgrowths of the epidermis. The dermis rests
on a layer of subcutaneous adipose tissue, the panniculus
adiposus. Beneath the fat, a sheet of fibrous connective
tissue, fascia, connects the skin to the subjacent tissues and
organs that it envelops.
The epidermis
The epidermis, the epithelial component of the skin.
contains
four
distinct cell
 types:  keratinocytes,
melano-cytes, Langerhans cells and Merkel cells. The
largest component of the epidermis is derived from
keratino-cytes, proliferating epithelial cells that grow and
differentiate into keratin-producing cells. The progenitor
keratinocytes lie in the basal layer of the epidermis, where
cell division occurs. The non-dividing daughter cells move
outwards,  enlarge,  differentiate
and

establish a distinctive stratified squamous epithelium in
which the stratum basale, the stratum spinosum, and the
stratum granulosum underlie the keratinized stratum
corneum (horny’ layer) at the surface of the skin (Fig.
92.1). The distinctive feature of the stratum spinosum is
the presence of large numbers of intercellular desmosomes
('spines') that link adjacent keratinocytes. The granules of
the stratum granulosum contain lipids that are extruded
into the intercellular spaces at the junction of the stratum
granulosum with the stratum corneum providing an
2177
intercellular  water barrier and
1maintaining cohesion
between the cells of the horny layer. In the stratum
cormeum, the cytoplasm, nuclei and organelles of the
keratinocytes are degraded and are supplanted by keratin,
contained within a tough insoluble sac, the cornified cell
the stratum corneum consists of several layers of tightly
packed, flattened, dead, horny cells (corneocytes). The
association of the keratinized cells with the insoluble
extracellular lipids has been compared to a wall in which
the cells represent the bricks and the intercellular lipids
represent the mortar. The more superficial keratinized cells
are continually exfoliated as flake-like squames. The

The other cells present in the epidermis are derived from
the neural crest or from the bone marrow. Melanocytes,
cells that synthesize melanin, are dendritic cells that
migrated in early embryonic life from the neural crest to
reside in the stratum basale. Their dendrites extend for
long
distances
between
keratino-cyteswithin the
epidermis; each melanocyte is in contact with many
keratinocytes and it can transfer melanin granules to those
cells. Merkel cells are also derived from the neural crest
and also reside in the stratum basale. They can detect
tactile stimuli. Langerhans cells are immature dendritic
cells that reside between keratinocytes, predominantly in
the stratum spinosum. Their elongated dendrites extend
into the interstitial spaces of the epidermis to create a
cellular network
 that  can detect infiltrating
foreign
antigens (Merad et al., 2008). They participate in both
innate and adaptive immune responses. As immature
dendritic cells, they recognize, capture and digest foreign
antigens to peptide fragments (innate immune response)
before they undergo transformation into mature dendritic
cells, present the antigenic peptides to nalve T cells in
draining lymph nodes and direct the development of
2179
primary adaptive immune responses appropriate to the type
of infectious agent detected (Lipscomb and Masten, 2002)
The dermis
The dermis consists of collagen and elastic tissue
embedded in ground substance (a mucopolysaccharide gel)
that has a high water-binding capacity. Nutrients and cells
pass through the ground substance on their way from the
blood vessels of the dermis to the avascular epidermis. The
rich blood supplyto
the skin,which has three
intercommunicating plexuses of vessels, terminates in the
dermis where it has some direct arteriovenous shunts that
play a significant role in thermoregulation. The endothelial
cells of the dermal microvasculature can express toll-1 ike
receptors; this may be important in sensing an infection, in
the recruitment of immune cells from the bloodstream, and
in healing of dermal wounds (Miller and Modlin, 2007).
During
 inflammatory
or
immunological  reactions,
pro-inflammatory cytokines cause endothelial cells of the
post-capillary venules  to express greater numbers of
adhesion molecules, thus promoting
gthe passage of
leukocytes into the dermis. Although the resident cell
population of the dermis is scant, a variety of cell types is
to be found close to the post-capillary venules: these
include fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages, lymphocytes
and dermal dendritic cells, all of which express toll-like
receptors and can contribute to immune responses. Mast
cells contribute to inflammatory reactions: they release
histamine, prostaglandins, TNF-aI chemotactic factors and
other mediators. The dermal dendritic cells have a number
of characteristics

antigen-presenting cells. Thus, the cellular components of
the dermal immune system are located adjacent to the
post-capillary venules  in an intimate relationship that
constitutes the dermal microvascular unit, a focal point of
cutaneous reactivity to antigenic stimuli. Most resident T
cells in normal uninflamed skin are located at these
perivascular sites, from which they can be mobilized
rapidly when a local immune response begins.
Responses of the skin to microorganisms
In health, the skin supports commensal microorganisms
that locate on the surface and within the outer layers of the
stratum corneum. Despite continuous desquamation of the
more superficial corneocytes, some of the commensal
microorganisms persist as resident microflora with which
invading microbes must compete for binding sites and for
nutrients. Some of the commensals act on lipids secreted
by the sebaceous glands producing free fatty acids that are
toxic to many bacteria. The resident flora may release
antibacterial  substances (bacteriocins)  that inhibit the
growth of other bacteria. Thus, the resident commensals
help to inhibit colonization by pathogens. The intact skin
provides a formidable physical barrier to invasion by
pathogens. In the stratum corneum, the interlocking layers
of dead keratinized cormeocytes and the intercellular lipids
form a “brick wall′ that pathogens cannot penetrate while it
remains intact. The barrier function is reinforced by tight
cell-to-cell adhesion within the layers of nucleated
keratinocytes beneath the stratum cormeum. In addition, the
host has the protection of a chemical barrier created on the
2181
surface of the skin by the constitutive release of
antimicrobial lipids and antimicrobial peptides which can
be released in greater amounts when the immune defences
of the skin are challenged by pathogens.
Immune defences of the skin
innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.
The innate immune arm recognizes invading pathogens,
mounts immediate defensive action against them and sets
the adaptive immune response in train. In turn, the
adaptive immune arm is driven by dendritic cells that
process microbial antigens to peptides, deliver the
immunogenic peptides to draining lymph nodes, and direct
the differentiation of nafve lymphocytes into activated T
cells responsive to the antigens of the invading pathogen.
Thus, the immune response to cutaneous infection begins
in the draining lymph nodes rather than in the skin

The innate immune response
The innate immune defence of the skin consists of five
principal elements, of which the first two are the physical
barrier to microbial invasion at the stratum cormneum and
the chemical barrier created by constitutive release of
antimicrobial lipids and antimicrobial peptides (Box 92. 1).
Some of the antimicrobial lipids are synthesized and
released
1by keratinocytes;
  others   are   delivered  in
secretions from sebaceous glands (Drake et al., 2008). The
principal  antimicrobial  peptides  released  by  epidermal
cells are defensins and cathelicidins. Small amounts of
these cationic peptides are expressed constitutively by
healthy skin. They

participating with the other peptides in the recruitment of

and B cells to the sites of infection. In conjunction with
several chemokines and cytokines, the antimicrobial
peptides participate in a range of immunomodulatory
activities in relation to the complement system, antibody
production, cytokine production, phagocytosis and tissue
repair (Palffyi et al., 2009). Significantly, antimicrobial
peptides are able to recruit and to activate dendritic cells,
the antigen-presenting cells that link innate recognition of
invading pathogens to the generation of appropriate types
of adaptive immune responses (Lee and Iwasaki, 2007)

Pathogens invading the skin are recognized by the toll-like

(Box 92.2). In response to TLR signals, all three cell types
release
  several
 chemokines   and
 proinflammatory
cytokines, principally IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. The
chemokines and cytokines are recognized by receptors
expressed on the immature dendritic cells. Thus the
dendritic cells are activated by both direct and indirect
signals from the TLRs. The immediate result is a sharp but
transient increase in phagocytic activity by dendritic cells
during which the infectious agents are engulfed and the
2185
microbial antigens are digested into immunogenic peptide
fragments. After this short phase as antigen-collecting
cells, the dendritic cells enter afferent lymphatics and
migrate to the draining lymph node; en route, they undergo
a maturation process which enables them to act as
antigen-presenting
cells.The
main features of this
transformation are loss of phagocytic capacity, expression
of co-stimulatory molecules required for the activation of
T cells, and expression of large numbers of MHC
molecules on the cell surface.

The T cells, activated by interaction with the MHC-peptide
complex, migrate from the lymph nodes to the site of
infection where they undergo clonal expansion and initiate
an adaptive immune response specific for the invading
pathogen.
2186
Histopathological responses of the dermis to microbial
infection
The primary responsive component of the dermis is the
microvasculature, specifically the capillary-venular bed of
the superficial plexus
(Fig.92.2).
.Proinflammatory
mediators dilate these vessels, increase their permeability
and activate their endothelial cells. The increase in
permeability allows fluid and plasma proteins to cross
from the blood to tissue spaces. Blood flows through the
dilated capillaries and venules at a reduced speed, which
allows the leukocytes to reach the periphery of the column
of blood, in apposition to the vascular surface of the
endothelial cells. Activated endothelial cells express
adhesion molecules to which the marginated leukocytes
attach. At the same time, some of the mediators are
responsible for the expression of chemotactic factors that
induce the marginated leukocytes to pass between adjacent
endothelial cells into the perivascular dermis. Neutrophils
monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils may
participate in the cellular response to cutaneous infection.
The composition and the intensity of the cellular exudate
can vary, depending on which mediators are released in
response to the microbial challenge. The variation is
attributable to the activity of mediators that modulate the
expression and avidity of different adhesion molecules on
the endothelial cells and of different chemotactic factors in
the dermis. In most acute inflammatory reactions to
bacterial pathogens, neutrophils are the first cells to invade
the perivascular connective tissue and they remain the
predominant cells for 6 to 24 hours. Thereafter, the
infiltrate is likely to be dominated by mononuclear cells,
initially by macrophages. The majority of macrophages
2187
derive from extravasated monocytes. Lymphocytes arrive
at a later stage. If the bacterial infection extends into a
chronic phase, the dermis is infiltrated by macrophages.
lymphocytes and plasma cells. Chronic inflammatory
lesions in the dermis commonly lead to the proliferation of
fibroblasts and deposition of newly formed collagen
fibrils. When excessive collagen forms, it becomes scar
tissue.
Infection   of    hair follicles   with 
accumulationof
inflammatory cells within follicular lumina (luminal
folliculitis) can lead to the rupture of follicular walls and
discharge of the contents, including keratin, into the
dermis. This condition, known as furunculosis, is caused
most commonly by Staphylococcus species, less frequently
byStreptococcus species and Pseudomonas species.
Because of the discharge of keratin into the extracellular
space, the dermis mounts an inflammatory reaction which
includes a large number of eosinophils.
In several systemic infectious diseases, blood flow in the
skin is compromised by inflammation and thrombosis in
the  dermal
 vasculature.
In    many
instances,the
consequences of the vascular lesions are evident as visible
lesions in the epidermis, mainly as infarcts. Typically, the
raised erythematous diamond-shaped lesions caused by
and thrombosis of small dermal arterioles. The visible
lesion is an area of dry necrosis, an infarct, that occupies
the segment of skin supplied by the occluded vessels. In
several species, young animals that have recovered from
septicaemic Salmonella infections develop dry necrotic
lesions on the extremities of ears and tails due to vasculitis
2188
and thrombosis in small arterial vessels. Calves that
recover from the septicaemic form of Salmonella Dublin
infection in the first 3 months of life are liable to develop
more serious dry gangrenous lesions affecting skin,
underlying soft tissues and bone in the distal parts of their
hind limbs. The gross lesion is similar to gangrenous
ergotism caused by the alkaloids of Claviceps purpurea
but the pathogenesis of the two conditions is different.
Foci of cutaneous necrosis in the scrotum, ears, nose,
nipples and limbs have been observed in dogs infected
with Rickettsia rickettsii, the causal organism of Rocky
Mountain  spotted   fever.  This  obligate   intracellular
pathogen replicates within host endothelial cells, destroys
the cells and induces necrotizing vasculitis and thrombosis
in the dermal vessels which, in turm, lead to the cutaneous
infarcts.
Cutaneous necrosis is a feature of toxic shock syndrome in
dogs. Many of the recorded cases have been attributed to
Streptococcus canis but Staphylococcus pseudintermedius
has been implicated in some dogs. Although the primary
site of the infection is not always in the integument, the
syndrome is often linked to necrotizing fasciitis, a

cells, increases vascular permeability and causes oedema
in target tissues, including the skin of eyelids and the
submandibular area.
Histopathological responses of the epidermis to microbial
infection
In normal circumstances, cell division in the stratum basale
matches the loss of cornified cells from the stratum
corneum. The continuity of the epidermal component of
the skin is dependent on the appropriate completion of the
three cardinal activities of the keratinocytes: proliferation,
differentiation with
outward
displacement,  and
desquamation. Any disturbance in these processes or in the
intercellular cohesion of the differentiating keratinocytes
results in structural changes in the epidermis. A range of
structural  changes  can  develop  during   cutaneous
infections.
Hyperplasia, an increase in the number of non-cornified
keratinocytes, is due to an increase in cell division that is
not matched by cell loss. The thickness of the epidermis is
increased, usually by enlargement of the stratum spinosum,
a condition described as acanthosis which is a feature of
almost all chronic inflammatory skin conditions. Often, the
2190
hyperplasia results in pegs of epidermis that project down
into the underlying dermis (Fig. 92.3).

the level of the stratum corneum, they are imperfectly
keratinized and they retain their nuclei, a condition known
as parakeratosis. This condition is common in ringworm
lesions in calves and in advanced exudative epidermitis in
piglets.

In the epidermis, the several layers of keratinocytes are
held as a cohesive sheet of cells by the numerous
desmosomes that link the plasma membranes of adjacent
cells and by the intercellular cement substance. During
acute inflammatory reactions in the skin, proteolytic
enzymes released by neutrophils can contribute to the
breakdown of desmosomes. Acantholysis, loss of cohesion
between keratinocytes due to breakdown of desmosomes,
results in rounded keratinocytes with clefts, vesicles, and
bullae in the tissue. Clefts are slit-like spaces that do not
contain fluid; vesicles, or blisters, are localized collections
of tissue fluid within or beneath the epidermis; bullae are
large blisters, greater than 1 cm in diameter. Cavities in the
epidermis that are filled with purulent fluid are called
pustules. Since the epidermis is avascular, the fluid that
forms vesicles and the neutrophils that result in pustules
arrive from the dermis. After they leave the bloodstream at
the postcapillary venules in the outer region of the dermis.
fluid and cells pass into the epidermis through the
basement membrane and move along the spaces between
the keratinocytes. When an influx of tissue fluid widens
the intercellular spaces and accentuates the intercellular
bridges, the keratinocytes appear to be elongated and the
epidermis acquires a ‘spongy’&
appearance. Spongiosis
(intercellular oedema) is a common feature in epidermal
inflammation caused by staphylococci or Malassezid
species. Severe intercellular oedema may lead to rupture of
intercellular bridges; spongiosis gives way to acantholysis.
Similarly, intracellular oedema (ballooning degeneration)
of keratinocytes induced by pox viruses can progress until
the affected cells burst, resulting in the accumulation of
fluid in multilocular vesicles whose septae are formed by
2192
the residual cell walls, a lesion described as reticular
degeneration.
Acantholysis is the initial lesion in exudative epidermitis
in suckling and weaned piglets (greasy pig disease). The
disease  is  induced
by   epidermolysins  released  by
Staphylococcushyicus or byS.chromogenes.
.These
exfoliative toxins cleave the epidermis between the stratum
granulosum and the stratum corneum. The destruction of
desmosomes by these exotoxins is comparable to the
action of S. aureus epidermolysin in the scalded skin
syndrome in children. The earliest microscopic lesions are
subcorneal   vesicles   which   become  pustules   when
neutrophils move into the cavities.
Bacterial diseases of skin
The physical, chemical and immunological defences
discussed above ensure that the normal intact skin of a
healthy animal is highly resistant to bacterial infection.
However, bacteria can penetrate the physical barrier when
the continuity of the epidermis is broken by wounds.
trauma, scratches, biting insects, thorns, awns or
hypodermic needles. Areas of skin that are damaged by
chemical irritants, burms or freezing are liable to become
infected, as are areas that are continually moist, or are
covered with accumulated dirt, matted hair or exudates.
Bacterial diseases of the skin occur more frequently in
dogs than in other domestic animals. This is attributed to a
relatively thin stratum cormeum, and the small amount of
intercellular lipids in the canine stratum corneum, together
with the relatively high pH of canine skin and the absence
of a protective lipid seal at the entrance of hair follicles.
2193
Many bacteria cause skin infections; most of the pathogens
are pyogenic and the cutaneous pathological change they
cause
1S
 called
pyoderma.
Coagulase-positive
staphylococci are the most common cause of pyoderma in
domestic animals. Staphylococcus pseud-intermedius is the
predominant isolate from pyoderma in dogs and cats, while
S. aureus is frequently isolated from pyoderma in horses,
cattle and sheep, and S. hyicus is an important cause in
pigs. Pyoderma is categorized as superficial or deep (Box
92.3). In superficial pyoderma, the lesions are confined to
the epidermis and they may or may not involve the outer
portion of the hair follicles. In deep pyoderma, the
inflammatory lesions are located in the dermis, or the
subcutis or both. They may develop fistulous tracts
through which purulent exudate is released on to the
surface of the skin.

Superficial bacterial pyoderma
Superficial pyoderma is a generalized infection of the skin
in which the gross lesions are erythema, vesicle formation,
pustules, exudates, crusts, and peripheral expanding rings
of flaky scales (‘epidermal collarettes', the peeling
remnants of the keratinized roof of the vesicle). The
circular lesions of superficial pyoderma closely resemble
ringworm lesions. The disease is commonly caused by
coagulase-positive staphylococci but it is rarely associated
with systemic illness and it does not leave a scar.

involve hair follicles. In juvenile impetigo (prepubescent
animals), the disease begins as subcorneal pustules that
extend outwards projecting above the skin surface between
the hair follicles. The pustules are composed
predominantly of neutrophils; they are fragile, they rupture
easily and the purulent discharge forms an adherent crust
on the skin surface. In kittens, the lesions are commonly
located on the dorsum of the neck and shoulders, where the
queen grasps kittens in her mouth. Here, the infective
agents are streptococci and Pasteurella species from the
oral flora of the queen. Adult animals may develop a
bullous (blistering) impetigo, consisting of large flaccid
pustules that span several hair follicles. In dogs, this form
of
impetigo   often   occurs 
in  conjunction
with
hyperadrenalism, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism.

the superficial venules and perivascular accumulations of
neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells. In some
affected dogs, pruritus is intense
Staphylococcus hyicus, the cause of exudative epidermitis
in neonatal and suckling piglets, produces an exfoliative
exotoxin that targets cells of the stratum granulosum,
2196
destroying the desmosomal intercellular adhesion molecule
that binds those cells to the stratum corneum. The
immediate result is acantholysis, cleavage of the epidermis
at the interface between the two layers. The bacteria
initiate subcorneal pustular dermatitis in the interfollicular
epidermis which then extends to hair follicles, resulting in
superficial purulent folliculitis. In neonates, the earliest
lesions are on the head; they spread rapidly to thorax,
abdomen and legs. Small areas of the stratum corneum
peel off and the underlying tissue is quickly covered by a
greasy, dark-brown exudate. The lesions rapidly coalesce
and soon the whole body is covered by the exudate, giving
the animal an overall greasy appearance. In the fully
developed lesion, the epidermis is acanthotic, has
microabscesses and has a fissured dark brown crust of
keratin and exudate. In neonates, the affected skin is
unable to serve its normal role in fluid and electrolyte
balance: survival  is compromised by dehydration and
electrolyte imbalance.
Superficial exudative dermatitis is induced in a wide range
of mammalian hosts by the Gram-positive actinomycete
Dermatophilus congolensis. This bacterium expresses two
distinct phenotypic forms during its life cycle: motile
zoospores and filamentous hyphae. The flagellated
zoospores are infective; after entry to the epidermis, they
germinate into hyphae that arborize within the viable
epidermis, induce inflammation and produce another
generation of zoospores to complete the life cycle. In
nature, the reservoir for D. congolensis appears to be in the
skin of carrier animals, where dormant zoospores can
survive for extended periods. Dry scabs on infected
animals also harbour dormant zoospores for long periods.
2197
In both situations, persistent moisture is required to
activate the spores before they can be transferred to new
hosts by direct contact or through mechanical transfer by
arthropod vectors, including ticks, flies and mosquitoes.
Normally, the physical and chemical barriers at the surface
of the skin are able to exclude D. congolensis. However,
the
organism can invade the epidermis when that tissue has
been punctured or after it has been exposed to excess
moisture over an extended period.
Dermatophilosis occurs worldwide, but most frequently in
tropical and subtropical climates where the development

temperature and the activities of biting insects that act as
mechanical vectors. The proliferation of the filamentous
pathogen within the epidermis elicits astrong
inflammatory response that gives rise to micro-abscesses
in the more superficial cell layers and a dense band of
neutrophils beneath the epidermis, separating the epithelial
tissue from the underlying dermis. The superficial cells
cornify and form scabs. Beneath the neutrophilic band, a
new epidermis is formed by outgrowths from the hair
follicles and from adjacent residual epidermis. In this way,
the mass of inflammatory cells is segregated between the
infected cormified epithelium and the newly formed
epidermis. The new epidermis is often invaded by
extension of microbial filaments from the hair follicles
which initiates another cycle of bacterial invasion,
inflammation and epidermal renewal. Repetition of this
sequence of events results in the multilaminar purulent

cause subcutaneous abscesses in foals, as does Histophilus

by extension of an infectious process that has begun in the
outer region of the hair follicle. Intense inflammation in
the deep region of the follicle often leads to rupture of the
follicular wall and extension of the infection into the
surrounding   dermis
and
panniculus.  The local
foreign-body reaction provoked by the released keratin,
sebum and products of inflammation produces a furuncle
from which fistulous tracts discharge purulent exudate on
to the surface of the skin. Within the dermis, foci of
purulent exudate may be circumscribed by granulation
tissue or by mature fibrous tissue forming abscesses.
2199
Cellulitis is the term used to describe a diffuse, deep, acute
inflammation that involves both dermis and subcutis. The
lesion spreads underneath the skin in the panniculus and it
is poorly circumscribed. Areas of the overlying skin are
necrotic and may slough. Cellulitis is a common sequel to
deep bite wounds in cats. In domestic animals, cellulitis
has been attributed to a wide range of bacterial infections,
including
staphylococci,
Pasteurellamultocida,
Corynebacterium
1pseudotuberculosisandClostridium
species. Pyogra-nulomatous lesions, involving the dermis,
the panniculus or both, occur in dogs, cats, horses and
cattle. The most common isolates from these lesions are
Actinomyces viscosus or Nocardia asteroides. Grossly, the
lesions consist of firm nodules, abscesses, fistulous tracts,
and extensive fibrosis. The exudate contains ‘sulphur
granules’ Histologically, the lesion consists of a number of
pyogranulomatous foci in an extensive field of fibrous
tissue. Each of the abscesses contains a mass of
Gram-positive bacteria clustered within an accumulation
of neutrophils, which, in turn, are surrounded by
epithelioid macrophages with some multinucleated giant
cells. The fibrous tissue that separates and encapsulates the
many abscesses is infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma
cells.
Viral diseases of skin
The intact skin is resistant to invasion by viruses, but these
pathogens can gain entry through wounds or arthropod
bites. Some viruses may induce skin lesions adjacent to the
point of entry; for instance, the herpes-virus that causes
bovine mammilitis and the papillomaviruses that induce
papillomas in several species. More often, virus-induced
2200
cutaneous lesions arise during the viraemic phase of a
systemic infection; this is true even for some viruses that
enter percutaneously such as the virus of lumpy skin
disease.
Skin lesions induced by viruses may be vesicular.
proliferative or neoplastic. Vesicles are the characteristic
primary lesions in foot-and-mouth disease and in swine
vesicular disease. The lesions develop in skin around the
mouth and on the feet, teats, and mammary gland. The
viruses have a predilection for the metabolically active
cells of the stratum spinosum where they cause ballooning
degeneration of individual keratinocytes. The intercellular
desmosomes of the
affected cells are lost, the keratinocytes detach from one
another, and the intercellular cavities fill with vesicular
fluid. In foot-and-mouth disease, the small vesicles
coalesce forming bullae. In cattle, some bullae may be up
to 6 cm across and the extensive domes of epidermal cells
are easily rubbed off, leaving raw ulcers that are prone to
secondary bacterial infection.
Pox viruses induce both proliferative and degenerative
changes in skin. A distinguishing feature of pox-virus
lesions is the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies
which may be seen in the epidermis, dermis or both. These
and, in the dermis, they are often seen in endothelial cells,
macrophages, or fibroblasts. Inclusion bodies are
prominent in the mononuclear cells that invade the dermis
in sheeppox. In the epidermis, the pox lesions develop
through a typical sequence: macule, papule, vesicle,
pustule, crust, and scar. Histopathological changes begin
2201
with ballooning degeneration and rupture of keratinocytes,
resulting in multiloculated vesicles (reticular degeneration)
in the stratum spinosum. Fluid and neutrophils enter the
epidermis from the dermis. Fluid distends the intercellular
spaces, stretching the desmosomes (spongiosis) and
progressing until the intercellular linkages are broken
(acantholysis). The vesicular stage is prominent in some
pox infections, such as sheeppox, but it is insignificant in
others, such as contagious pustular dermatitis (orf) in
sheep. The infiltrating neutrophils aggregate in vesicles
forming pustules. In contagious pustular dermatitis, the
pustules remain flat and are covered by a thick layer of
crust. In other pox diseases, the pustule has a depressed
centre and raised borders. This umbilicated gross lesion is
recognized as a ^pock'. The raised borders are the result of
hyperplasia of adjacent  keratinocytes. The extent of
epidermal hyperplasia  varies among

pathological changes of the dermis as well as the typical
pox lesions in the epidermis. The dermis is invaded by
large numbers of virus- infected mononuclear cells with
intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies ((sheeppox cells'),
severe necrotizing vasculitis develops in arterioles and
post-capillary venules, and ischaemic necrosis of the
dermis and overlying epidermis ensues.
Papillomaviruses induce two types of tumour-like lesions
of skin: squamous papillomas and fibropapil-lomas. A
typical papilloma is a wart-like mass in which there is
2202
proliferation of epithelial  cells  without  proliferation of
dermal fibroblasts. The epidermis is hyperkeratotic and
hyperplastic and it is supported by thin stalks of dermis.
Lesions may vary in size from small nodules to large
cauliflower-like  structures. In
young cattle, these
fibropapillomas, the proliferating cell is the dermal
fibroblast. The lesions appear as nodules or plaques
covered by a variably hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic
epidermis. The most common neoplasm of horses is the
equine sarcoid, a fibropapilloma associated with a virus
closely related to bovine papillomavirus types 1 and 2.
Fungal diseases of skin
Fungi abound in the environment but only a small
proportion of the many thousands of fungal species has the
ability to survive at the higher temperature in mammalian
tissues. When fungi are able to cause disease in normal
animals, they are regarded as true pathogens; other fungi
are described as opportunistic pathogens because  they
induce disease only in animals in which resistance to
infection

compromised
by
ill-health,
immunosuppression, or inadequate nutrition (Box 92.4)
Based on the location of lesions, mycotic infections can be
classified  into
three
basic
categories: superficial,
subcutaneous, and systemic. Superficial dermatoses are
infections in which the fungi are restricted to mucous
membranes or to the epidermis and the keratinized
structures of hair, feather, claw, and horn. These infections
include  candidiasis,  Malassezia  dermatitis,  and
dermatophytosis (ringworm). Subcutaneous dermatoses
2203
can be caused by a wide variety of saprophytic fungi that
gain direct entry to the dermis and subcutis through
accidental puncture of the skin by contaminated objects.
The organisms are of low virulence, the disease is chronic
and the lesions tend to remain localized. The lesions begin
as small  dermal  or subcutaneous papules that enlarge
gradually over months or years to become mycetomas,
nodular masses of granulomatous inflammation with
fibrosis and with fistulous tracts that discharge exudate on
to the surface of the skin. Typically, the exudates contain
grains composed of masses of fungal hyphae. Systemic
mycoses are responsible for lesions in intermal organs, such
as the respiratory and digestive systems, but they may
involve cutaneous tissues by haematogenous spread. These
infections include blastomycosis and histoplasmosis.

Although Candida albicans is not a normal inhabitant of
the skin, the yeast phase of the organism is commonly
present as a commensal on the mucous membranes of the
alimentary, upper respiratory and genital tracts and at
mucocutaneous junctions at body orifices. Hence, most
cases of candidiasis are
opportunisticinfectionsof
endogenous origin. Invasion of host tissues is facilitated by
the transformation of the organism from the yeast phase to
the branching pseudomycelial phase. Candidiasis is mainly
a disease of keratinized epithelium, most frequently in the
oral cavity and in the stomach of young animals, especially
piglets, calves and foals. Less frequently, when host
resistance is compromised, C. albicans invades the
keratinized epidermis. Cutaneous lesions evolve through
papules, vesicles and pustules to discrete ulcers with
erythematous borders and foul-smelling exudates. Special
stains
s(suchasperiodicacid-Schiff orGomori
methenamine silver) can be used to demonstrate yeast cells
2205
on the surface of the lesion and pseudohyphae invading the
hyperkeratotic epidermis.
Malazessia pachydermatis, a lipophilic yeast, is a member
of the normal flora of the skin of dogs and cats. It is a
common cause of otitis exterma. On the skin, it proliferates
and causes a greasy dermatitis when host defences are
compromised. Clinical signs include hyperaemia, scaly
plaques, hyperpigmentation, alopecia, pruritus and a rancid
odour.
Dermatophytosis ( ringworm') is an infection of keratin in
the stratum corneum, hair, and nails. These infections are
caused by a relatively small group of fungi, the
dermatophytes, that are capable of degrading keratin and
living on it. Keratin is an insoluble protein in which the
polypeptide chains are stabilized by disulphide bonds
between the abundant cysteine residues. As a result of this
structural feature, keratin is very resistant to chemical
degradation but reducing agents impair resistance to
proteolytic enzymes. During infection, the fungi excrete
large quantities of sulphite and they secrete a battery of
proteolytic enzymes. The sulphite is a reducing agent that
cleaves the disulphide bonds in keratin and it gives the
proteases access to the reduced proteins. The proteases
degrade the polypeptides to short peptides and amino
acids, which the fungi assimilate as nutrients.
Dermatophytes affecting domestic animals are members of
one of two genera, Microsporum or Trichophyton. Based
on their natural habitat and host preference, dermatophytes
are grouped into geophilic, zoophilic and anthropophilic
species. Geophilic fungi are present in the soil as free-l
2206
iving saprophytes but they can cause disease in animals
and humans as opportunist pathogens, for example
In  contrast,  zoophilic  and
anthropophilic  dermatophytes  have adopted a parasitic
existence on the skin of mammalian hosts. Zoophilic
species have become obligate parasites on the skin of
animals, for example Microsporum canis in cats or
Trichophytonver-rucosum
1n
1cattle. Anthropophilic
species have become obligate parasites on human skin.
Some of the obligate parasites have become specialized for
a single host; for example, Microsporum nanum is found
almost exclusively in pigs. Other dermatophytes, such as
Trichophyton mentagrophytes,infect a wide variety of
mammals. Zoophilic fungi frequently cause disease in
humans, whereas anthropophilic
fungi rarely infect
non-human hosts. The association with a particular host
species is reflected in different types and degrees of
inflammatory responses by human skin to anthro-pophilic
and zoophilic dermatophytes. In young children, the highly
anthropophilic  Microsporum  audouinii  elicits  a  mild

Bacterial causes of bovine mastitis
Mastitis is a common infectious disease in intensively
farmed dairy cattle. Although more than 1o0 microbial
species have been isolated from the bovine mammary
gland, a relatively small number are responsible for most
cases of clinical mastitis. It is usual to designate mastitis
according to the origin of the organisms. Contagious
mastitis is caused by bacteria that reside primarily in the
mammary gland of cows whereas environmental mastitis is
associated with microorganisms that are present in the
environment. Formerly, contagious mastitis accounted for
most outbreaks of the
disease
but.
following
the
implementation of mastitis control programmes during the
past three decades, the incidence of contagious mastitis
due
etoStaphylococcus
aureus
and
IStreptococcus
agalactiae declined. Data from the UK show that the
incidence   of
 clinical
mastitis decreased  from
approximately 150 cases per 100 cows per year in the
1960s (Wilson and Kingwill, 1975) to between 47 and 65
cases per 100 cows per year in 2004-2005 (Bradley et al.,
2007). Mastitis control
programmes are particularly
effective against pathogens that reside in the mammary
gland. Control measures for mastitis pathogens which are
widespread in the environment are difficult to implement.
Mastitis remains the most common and economically
important infectious disease of dairy cows (Kossaibati and
Esslemont,1997)
2209
With the exception of Mycoplasma species which can
invade the mammary gland from the bloodstream, most
organisms which cause mastitis enter the gland through the
teat canal. Fungal and viral pathogens are occasionally
implicated in mastitis. Five bacterial pathogens are
responsible for most cases of bovine mastitis (Box 93.1)
Mammary gland defence mechanisms
The teat orifice and the teat canal are the first barriers to
infection of the mammary gland. Some pathogens such as
S. aureus colonize the teat skin and teat canal, increasing
the probability of intramammary infection. Desquamation
of keratinized cells from the epithelial surface of the teat
canal may contribute to the mechanical removal of bacteria
from this location. In addition, fatty acids present in the
keratinized layer exert a bacteriostatic effect. The flushing
action of milk through the gland also acts as a natural
defence mechanism, and frequent stripping of the gland is
recommended  for  treatment of mastitis  caused
1by
Gram-negative bacteria. Teat length may be important in
determining susceptibility to infection. In heifers, short
teats in association with oedema of mammary tissue at
calving may predispose to mastitis (Waage et al., 2001).
Superficial teat lesions also increase the likelihood of
infection due to impairment of mechanical barriers. Even
relatively mild hyperkeratosis of the teat orifice caused by
incorrect milking machine function  is associated  with
increased subclinical mastitis (Lewis et al., 2000)
Non-specific antibacterial factors found in the mammary
gland are listed in Box 93.2.
Lactoferrin  exerts a
2210
bacteriostatic effect by binding free ferric ions which are
then unavailable for bacterial utilization.

Because of the low concentration of lactoferrin in the
lactating mammary gland, its principal function appears to
relate to protection against coliform infection during the
drying-off period.  Lysozyme  is  a bactericidal protein
active against Gram-positive bacteria but, because it is
present in low concentrations in bovine milk, its
significance compared with other defence mechanisms is
uncertain.
 The
lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen
peroxide system

bacteria and bactericidal for Gram-negative bacteria. This
2211
system depends on adequate concentrations of all three
components within the mammary gland. Lactoperoxidase

in
 mammary epithelium whereas
thiocyanate levels are influenced by the dietary intake of
certain green feeds. Hydrogen peroxide may be produced
by a variety of enzymatic activities in milk and by the
metabolic   activity  of  certain bacteria, if
 present.
Complement, activated by the alternate pathway, may
contribute to a limited extent to defence against
Gramnegative bacteria. The role of other elements of
innate immunity, including nitric oxide synthase and acute
phase proteins such as serum amyloid A, in defence of the
mammary gland is not yet clearly defined. Antimicrobial
peptides are likely to have important immunomodulatory
functions but their exact role in protection of the mammary
gland against mastitis is uncertain (Bowdish et al., 2005)
Cell counts in the non-infected lactating mammary gland
are usually less than 1o? somatic cells per ml. The cell
types include macrophages, with lesser numbers of
lymphocytes and neutrophils and small numbers of
epithelial cells. Cell counts tend to be elevated during early
and late lactation and the percentage of neutrophils
increases late in lactation. The speed of recruitment of
cells to the udder is an important factor in susceptibility to
mastitis, and cows with low somatic cell counts before
infection are at greater risk of developing severe disease
than cows with high cell counts. The inflammatory
response is initiated by macrophages which recognize the
invading pathogens. The macrophages release cytokines
such
 asIL-1β andTNF-α
whichstimulatethe
inflammatory  response  and  increase  the bactericidal
properties of neutrophils. Neutrophils are the principal
2212
cells involved in eliminating bacteria from the mammary
gland. Recruitment of neutrophils from the blood to the
site of infection in response to a number of inflammatory
mediators, such as cytokines and prostaglandins, is one of
the first steps in the inflammatory response. Epithelial and
endothelial cells play an important role in recruitment of
neutrophils as it is proposed that adhesion of bacteria to
epithelial cells and the action of bacterial toxins on these
cells induce the synthesis of cytokines such as TNF-α and
IL-6 (Rainard and Riollet, 2003). These cytokines then
activate expression of a number of adhesion molecules by
endothelial cells. Binding of neutrophils to endothelial
cells follows.  Migration of neutrophils along the
endothelium and into the tissues is facilitated by
chemoattractants such as C5a, C3a, LPS, IL-1, IL-2 and
IL-8 (Rainard and Riollet, 2006) Cell numbers in milk
increase within hours of infection, with counts of several
hundred cells per ml common in subclinical infections. In
clinical mastitis, millions of cells per ml may be present.

generally effective against Gram-negative bacteria but
organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, which produce

killing is mediated through hydrolytic enzymes within
lysosomes. However, the fiunctioning of this mechanism
may be less efficient in milk due to ingestion of casein and
fat particles by neutrophils. Tissue damage and impaired
mammary function may result from the respiratory burst

2213
The role of lymphocytes in the protection of the mammary
gland is the subject of much research. The proportion of T
lymphocytes present, which varies with the stage of
lactation, is greatest in late lactation, and the ratio of T
lymphocyte  subpopulations  also
changes throughout
lactation. The functional significance of these changes.
which is unclear, appears to correlate with reduced
resistance to infection in the postpartum period (Sordillo et
al., 1997).
The predominant immunoglobulin isotype  in normal
bovine milk, IgG1, is selectively transferred into milk from
serum but concentrations
sin normal milk are
low,
approximately
¥0.6
mg/ml
(Butler,
1981)
 and
concentrations of the other immunoglobulins are even
lower. During mastitis, there is an increase in permeability
of the epithelium separating the milk space from the
interstitial space and this allows passage of molecules from
blood into milk. This increase in permeability is important
as it allows the concentrations of immunoglobulins in milk
to rise during mastitis. The IgG1 isotype opsonizes bacteria
for phagocytosis by macrophages. As neutrophils are
recruited into the affected tissue, the importance of IgG2
increases because this isotype can opsonize bacteria for
phagocytosis by neutrophils. IgM can also act as an
opsonin.  IgA agglutinates bacteria, prevents bacterial
adherence to epithelium and neutralizes bacterial toxins.

infectious agents which cause contagious mastitis, namely
Staphylococcus

Scontrolmeasures.
Staphylococcus aureus can colonize the teat skin and teat
 a o os  s  
However, the udder is considered to be the main source of
infection as strain typing using techniques such as
multilocus sequence typing has shown that strains of S.
aureus derived from the udder are different from those
isolated from other sites on the body. Smith et al. (2005)
reported that the majority of strains causing intramammary
infection in three countries (United Kingdom, United
States of America and Chile) belonged to a single clonal
complex. This finding suggests that certain strains are
adapted to the bovine udder. Although staphylococci are
p       
for weeks, transmission of infection occurs mainly at
milking through contaminated milkers’ hands, teat cup
liners    and
1uddercloths.Adhesinssuch
fibrinogen-binding protein and fibronectin-binding protein
2215
A facilitate adhesion to the internal mucosal surfaces, and
the organism produces a number of virulence factors
responses. Enzymes such as hyaluronidase, staphylokinase
and proteinases assist tissue invasion. Antiphagocytic
factors such as a capsule allow staphylococci to resist
phagocytosis and, even if engulfed, organisms can persist
and multiply within phagocytes. When this occurs, S.
aureus outlives the phagocytic cells and may be released
into the tissues where it can cause further damage.
Persistence within the mammary gland is likely to be
enhanced for those strains that survive within mammary
epithelial cells and by the production of biofilms (Melchior
et al., 2006). Virulence factors such as exoenzymes,
leukocidins and haemolysins, augment tissue damage.
Mastitis caused by S. aureus ranges in severity from
peracute
 to subclinical.
Chronic  subclinical disease
interspersed with periodic clinical episodes is the most
in virulence factor production between isolates from acute
and chronic staphylococcal mastitis, and variation in
disease manifestations is likely to be influenced by the
stage of lactation at which infection occurs. Severe disease
usually develops early in lactation. In the most severe
form, peracute gangrenous mastitis, the infection causes
venous thrombosis with local oedema and congestion of
the udder leading to tissue necrosis. In this uncommon
form of staphylococcal mastitis, onset is sudden, and
clinical signs include high fever, profound depression and
anorexia. The affected quarter is swollen and sore on
palpation. Udder discoloration becomes evident, and
gangrenous black areas are obvious within 24 hours.
2216
Toxaemia may result in death unless appropriate treatment
        
severe swelling of the affected gland and a purulent
secretion which often contains clots. Extensive fibrosis is a
common sequel.
In chronic or subclinical staphylococcal mastitis, episodes
of bacterial shedding from affected quarters occur along
with elevated somatic cell counts. Clinical detection of this
form of mastitis relates to the extent of tissue damage.
Bacterial multiplication occurs principally in the collecting
ducts and, to a limited extent, in the alveoli. The
inflammatory response results in duct blockage and
atrophy of the associated alveoli. Influx of phagocytic cells
may lead to abscess formation and fibrosis which further
limits effective
clearance of the organisms and also interferes with
antibiotic penetration during  treatment.  Accordingly,
although some intramammary infections caused by S.
aureus are cleared by immune mechanisms, the majority
become chronic, low-grade or subclinical resulting in
substantial production losses.
Streptococcusagalactiae
As a cause of mastitis, S. agalactiae has been encountered
less frequently in recent years than in the past. However, it
continues to be a problem in individual herds with high
cell counts. This pathogen is an obligate parasite of the
bovine mammary gland which can also survive to a limited
extent in the environment. In herds with poor hygiene,
environmental sources of infection may be important. The
course of infection is similar to that of chronic S. aureus
2217
infection with cycles of bacterial shedding and high
somatic cell counts. Few data are available on the
virulence factors of S. agalactiae which are important in
bovine mastitis. Various surface proteins are likely to be
important in adherence; a capsule offers protection against
phagocytosis and exoenzymes including haemolysins
contribute to the production of tissue damage. Following
introduction into the mammary gland, S. agalactiae
multiplies and invades the lactiferous ducts. Passage
through the duct walls into the lymphatic system and the
supramammary  lymph
node
occurs. An influx of
neutrophils into the gland follows and the inflammatory
reaction results in blockage of the teat ducts and atrophy of
secretory tissues. These inflammatory cycles occur
periodically with progressive loss of secretory tissue. A
relatively mild systemic reaction occurs coinciding with
the first phase of
 replication  and   inflammation.
Subsequently, clinical signs are usually mild and confined
to the mammary gland. When the inflammation of the
acini and ducts begins to resolve, the epithelial lining is
shed, contributing to clot formation in the milk. Most
udder damage has already occurred before clinically
detectable changes in milk are evident
Mycoplasma species
Although a number of Mycoplasma species have been
isolated from outbreaks of bovine mastitis, the most
important pathogen is Mycoplasma bovis. Mycoplasmal
mastitis is particularly common in large dairy herds. The
reservoir of infection appears to be clinically healthy
calves and young cattle which harbour M. bovis in the
respiratory tract. Infection may be introduced into a herd
2218
free of infection by accidental inoculation of the organisms
with teat syringes or cannulae. Once infection becomes
established, transmission to other animals occurs during
milking. Affected cows can shed 10? to 108 CFU per ml of
milk, contaminating milking machines, milkers’ hands and
cloths which are then important sources of infection for
other animals in the herd. Haematogenous spread of
infection between quarters occurs. Mycoplasma bovis can
also cause congenital infection, thus maintaining the
infection within a herd. The pathogenesis of mastitis
caused by Mycoplasma species is unclear. It is thought that
surface proteins are likely to be important for adherence
and immune evasion as has been shown for mycoplasmal
infections of other tissues. A purulent interstitial exudate is
present throughout the gland resulting in degeneration of
alveolar epithelium. This   is  followed  by epithelial
hyperplasia with fibrosis and atrophy in the late stages of
thedisease.
Clinical signs do not develop in all affected cows, and
subclinical carriers are important sources of infection.
When present, clinical signs include a dramatic alteration
in milk consistency and a rapid decrease in milk yield
within days of infection. The secretion appears normal but,
on standing, a deposit of sandlike or flocculent material
settles out leaving a whey-like supernatant. Later in the
disease,the secretion may
1 be scanty and thick or
serum-like, containing curds. As response to treatment is
variable, infection often results in agalactia
Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Corynebacterium
bovis
2219
These bacteria are minor mastitis pathogens but they may
cause subclinical infections or mild clinical disease. They
can
 be classified as contagious pathogens because
coagulase-negative staphylococci are considered to be part
of the normal flora of animals and C. bovis is an inhabitant
of the bovine mammary gland and teat ducts. Infections
in which teat dipping is not practised nor dry cow therapy
used, than in herds in which effective control measures are
in place. Infection with coagulase-negative staphylo-cocci,
apparently acquired during the dry period, is most common
at calving. Although a number of different species of
coagulase-negative staphylococci may be isolated from
mastitis cases (see Chapter 14), S. chromogenes and S.
hyicus are the species most often isolated from outbreaks
of intramammary infection and clinical mastitis. Many
infections  with  coagulase-negative  staphylococci are
eliminated shortly after calving but, if infection becomes
established,  it  tends  to
0persist.Somestrainsof
coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from cases of
mastitis are invasive and produce toxins (Anaya-Lopez et
al., 2006). Infection can result in increased somatic cell
counts or in mild
mastitis-producing pathogens are under control. It has been
suggested
thatcows
harbouring coagulase-negative
staphylococci are less likely to be affected with other
major  pathogens which  cause contagious mastitis.
Infection with C. bovis may protect cows against infection
with S. aureus but protection against streptococci does not
occur.
Environmental mastitis
2220
Bacteria commonly present in the environment, especially
E. coli and Streptococcus uberis, are the organisms most
frequently isolated from cases of clinical mastitis in many
countries.  Contamination of teat  ends is  a major
predisposing factor in the development of environmental
mastitis. Because environmental pathogens can survive
and multiply in organic bedding materials, housing
conditions can influence teat contamination rates. Mastitis
caused by S. uberis is particularly associated with bedding
of cows with straw. When sawdust and wood shavings are
used for bedding, E. coli and Klebsiella species are often
isolated from infected cows. The rate of infection is
sd  so u  a pno u r nsn
although S. uberis has been isolated from intensively
grazed pasture in numbers similar to those found in
bedding material (Harmon et al., 1992). Infection can be
transmitted  by
environmental
contaminationof
intramam-mary tubes.  Outbreaks of mastitis
with
organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or fungl.
which are resistant
tto antibiotics, are particularly
associated with this mode of transmission. Many infections
caused by environmental pathogens occur during the
drying-off period and in the weeks before calving. The
majority of infections with E. coli occur during the 7 to 10
days before calving which may be explained in part by the
ability of the organism to acquire iron from the dry
system (Smith and Hogan, 1993) Hogan and Smith, 2003).
Typically, environmental mastitis is of shorter duration
than contagious mastitis. In addition, infections caused by
coliform bacteria are likely to be clinically evident and
clinical  signs may be severe.  Bacterial pathogens
2221
periodically isolated from cows with mastitis are listed in
Box 93.3.
Escherichia coliv and other coliform bacteria
An association between herds with low bulk milk somatic
cell counts and an increased incidence of toxic mastitis has
been recorded. The majority of these outbreaks are caused
by infection with E. coli (Green et al., 1996; Menzies et
al., 2000). The relationship between bulk milk cell counts,
individual cow cell counts and the occurrence of toxic
mastitis has not been fully elucidated. Recent studies
suggest that slow recruitment of cells to the udder is a
factor predisposing to mastitis and that the level of somatic
cell counts in individual cows before infection can
influence the course and severity of the subsequent
mastitic episode (Hill, 1981; Shuster et al., 1996) Green,
2000). Somatic cell counts are not readily correlated with
the risk of coliform mastitis

The pathogenesis of coliform mastitis is largely attributed
to the effects of endotoxin. Endotoxic injury to the
microvasculature of the alveolar walls and interstitial
tissue of the mammary gland causes hyperaemia.
haemorrhage and oedema of the affected quarter. Coliform
bacteria do not usually invade the tissue and, if cows
survive the effects of endotoxin, affected quarters can
returm to partial production in the same lactation. Severity
of the disease is dependent on the neutrophil response and
the pre-existing level of neutrophils in the gland. Clinical
signs may be dramatic if the response is delayed and the
existing level of neutrophils is low, a feature of disease in
newly-calved cows. In peracute coliform mastitis, onset is
sudden and the cow becomes toxaemic, anorexic,
depressed and pyrexic. Within hours, recumbency and a
      n  
followed by profuse diarrhoea and dehydration. Usually,
the affected quarter is not markedly swollen or hot. The
serous secretion contains small flakes of necrotic tissue.
This is a serious disease and death may occur within one or
two days after the onset of signs. Animals that survive can
recover within a few days. Some surviving animals remain
recumbent for several days and resulting complications
may require euthanasia. Acute disease is characterized by
less severe systemic signs with a watery or serous
secretion from the affected quarter. Recovery is the usual
outcome. Chronic and
subclinical infections occur and recurring infections with
E. coli may be more common than previously thought
(Bradley and Green, 2001).
Streptococcusuberis
2223
Many sites in the cow including the tonsils, gastrointestinal
tract and genital tract and the coat can yield S. uberis
Contaminated bedding is considered to be an important
source of the organism facilitating transmission from the
high in straw, moderate in sawdust and wood shavings and
low in inorganic bedding such as sand. Streptococcus
uberis can be isolated from heavily used pasture in
bedding
It is considered that adherence to undamaged mammary
tissues is not of primary importance in the colonization of
the gland by S. uberis. However, a specific adhesion
molecule involved in attachment to bovine mammary
epithelial cells has been identified by Almeida et al.
(2006). Successful colonization may relate to an ability to
resist phagocytosis by neutrophils and the acquisition of
nutrients
Sfrom milk. Streptococci are nutritionally
fastidious organisms and S. uberis is unable to synthesize a
number of amino acids which are essential for growth
This organism secretes a plasminogen activator which
converts plasminogen to plasmin, a protease which can
hydrolyse casein to peptides. It is thought that S. uberis
can then use these peptides for growth. This proposed
pathogenic mechanism is unconfirmed, but the partial
success of the use of plasminogen activator as a vaccine
suggests that it may have a role in the pathogenesis of S.
uberis (Leigh, 1999). Resistance to both phagocytosis and
killing by neutrophils is attributed to the presence of a
capsule. Abnormalities in the milk are the only obvious
clinical features of infection in most cows. Signs of
2224
systemic disease characterized by fever and anorexia are
observed in less than 10% of affected cows.

possibly due to their ability to invade bovine mammary

summer mastitis of dry cows and heifers.

Clinical signs relate to the causative agent and range from
the acute haemorrhagic mastitis caused by B. cereus to the
mild, low-grade infections as observed in mastitis caused
by Listeria monocytogenes. However, low-grade infections
are important as a cause of decreased production. In
addition, infection with L. monocytogenes has zoonotic
implications. Microorganisms infrequently associated with
bovine mastitis are listed in Box 93.4
Summer mastitis
The term ‘Summer mastitis’ is used to describe an acute
suppurative mastitis which occurs in dry cows and heifers
at pasture during the summer and early autumn. It occurs
mainly in northerm and westerm Europe although sporadic
outbreaks of a clinically similar disease occur elsewhere.
Arcanobacterium
pyogenes
andPeptoniphilus
(Peptostreptococcus) indolicus are considered to be the
two principal pathogens involved in this mixed infection.
A primary role for S. cdysgalactiae has been suggested, and
other bacteria, especially anaerobes, are frequently isolated
from affected quarters. The high seasonal incidence of the
2226
disease suggests that risk factors for the disease increase in
summer. Flies, especially Hydrotoea irritans, may transmit
the bacteria involved in summer mastitis between cows,
and colonization and infection are most likely to occur
when teats are damaged due to rough grazing. Dry cows
and heifers are frequently grazed on less intensively
managed farmland adjacent to woods and scrub, which
form a suitable habitat for flies. Invasion of the mammary
gland occurs via the teat canal and results in severe clinical
mastitis with marked systemic effects. The virulence
factors of A. pyogenes include a pyolysin which is
cytolytic for cells of the immune system and is a putative
vaccine candidate. Bacterial adherence to mammary
epithelial cells  is  facilitated
1by neuraminidases and
extracellular matrix-binding proteins. Animals affected by
summer  mastitis are
pyrexic, anorexic, weak  and
depressed; some may abort. The affected quarter is
swollen, hard and painful and the secretion is watery with
clots. Later it becomes purulent with a foetid odour. If the
cow survives the toxaemia, an abscess may form and
eventually discharge to the exterior. There is usually
complete loss of function of the quarter and affected cows
are culled.
Diagnosis
The criteria for definition of mastitis have changed from
those first set by the International Dairy Federation in 1967
to a current threshold of 1oo,oo0 somatic cells per ml
(Hamann, 2005). However, regulatory limits for bulk milk
vary between countries and thus cell counts taken as
significant differ from country to country. A somatic cell
count of greater than 200,000 per ml is a threshold
2227
frequently used to define sub-clinical mastitis in an
individual animal. Establishment of an aetiological
diagnosis is dependent on the quality of the milk sample
submitted. If more than one organism is isolated from a
milk sample, such a sample is regarded as contaminated
and the results are unreliable. An exception occurs when
mastitis follows severe traumatic injury to the teats in
which mixed infections are relatively common. The correct
sampling procedure should be followed for milk
collection:
·Teats which are obviously dirty should be washed and dried
immediately.
· Each teat end should be treated with 70% ethyl alcohol and
left for 1 minute before sampling.
· As the first milk expressed may be contaminated, it should
be discarded.
· The sterile container used to collect the milk sample should
006  asoo au ue e p ai 0 eled s pla ag
to the teat being sampled. This minimizes the risk of
contamination from the udder or abdomen.
·The container should be capped tightly, labelled with the
If this is not possible, it should be stored at 4°C until it can
freezing at -20°C and, accordingly, samples can be frozen
and submitted in batches for culture. Some bacteria may not
survive freezing and, if difficulty in isolating pathogens
arises, samples should be submitted for culture immediately
after collection.
Most mastitis pathogens can be isolated easily using
routine culture methods. Media used for primary culture
are blood agar, Edward's medium, which is selective for
streptococci, and MacConkey agar. Colony morphology,
patterns of haemolysis and growth characteristics on these
2228
media often allow a presumptive identification to be made.
A definitive identification of a suspect pathogen can be
made using tests specific for that organism as described in
the chapters on individual pathogens. Diagnostic kits for
the identification of the more common mastitis pathogens
are available. These include miniaturized biochemical
systems which test the ability of an organism to utilize
different sugars. Other metabolic reactions can also be
detected.  These tests are
frequentlyusedforthe
identification of streptococci and members of the
Enterobacteriaceae.- Commercial agglutination test kits
are also available for Lancefield grouping of streptococci
and for agglutination assays to differentiate S. aureus from
coagulase-negative staphylococci.
Occasionally, bacteria cannot be isolated from mastitic
milk samples. Reasons for this include:
·Treatment with antibiotics before sampling.
·Destruction of the bacteria in the course of the
inflammatory reaction. In some forms of mastitis caused by
E. coli or other environmental organisms, systemic effects
of endotoxin continue in the absence of viable bacteria in
the milk.
·Chronic mastitis in which the organisms have been
eliminated but with persistence of the pathological changes.
· Failure to isolate pathogens may relate to the media and
cultural methods used. Some microorganisms such as
Mycoplasma species, Leptospira serovar Hardjo and fungi
require sui table media, specialized isolation procedures and
appropriate incubation conditi ons.
·Traumatic mastitis.
The history accompanying the samples may provide
background information relating to samples which are
bacteriologically negative. Further investigation may
2229
be required if the history does not match the results
obtained. Molecular methods increase the sensitivity of
detection and can detect injured or dead organisms. A
recent study by Taponen et al. (2009) using real-time PCR
techniques found that 43% of mastitis samples showing no
bacterial growth on culture contained between 10? to 10
genome copies of mastitis pathogens per ml of milk
Molecular diagnostic methods
Molecular methods for the detection of mastitis pathogens
have been developed and are particularly useful  for
pathogens which are difficult to culture. Cai et al. (2005)
reported the successful use of a real-time PCR for the
detection of Mycoplasma bovis in milk, an organism that
requires specialized culture methods.In a review of
molecular methods described in the literature, Cai et al.
(2003) suggested that real-time PCR methods may be most
useful as these methods are quantitative and thus may be
able to differentiate between true pathogens and small
numbers of contaminating organisms.  Multiplex PCR
procedures have been described for the detection and
differentiation of  the principal  Gram-positive mastitis
pathogens (Gillespie and Oliver, 2005).
Treatment
Antimicrobial agents are used extensively for the treatment
and control of bovine mastitis. Intramammary antibiotic
preparations are available to farmers in many countries and
this easy access is likely to result in excessive
antimicrobial chemotherapy. In countries such as Norway,
where  antibiotic  preparations  are available  only  on
2230
prescription, indiscriminate use of these therapeutic agents
is less likely to occur. It is important that the rationale for
use of antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis is thoroughly
understood by veterinarians prescribing treatment and that
this information is communicated clearly to farmers.
Antibiotics used in the treatment of mastitis can be
administered by parenteral or intramammary routes. In
most cases, administration by the intramammary route is
advised in order to achieve therapeutic concentrations in
milk (Constable et al., 2008). Intramuscular or intravenous
injection is likely to be beneficial for the treatment of acute
clinical mastitis caused by S. aureus or for dealing with
bacteraemia associated with severe E. coli mastitis. In
acute mastitis, antimicrobial compounds given by the
intramammary route may fail to reach the affected site due
to occlusion of milk ducts by inflammatory exudates.
Chemotherapeutic agents given by the parenteral route for
the treatment of mastitis should, ideally, have appropriate
characteristics (Box 93.5) which render them suitable for
treatment of mastitis (Sandholm, 1995; Ziv, 1980)

 Long half-life
Interactions between host, pathogen and antimicrobial
agent
In bovine mastitis, the choice of antimicrobial agent is
influenced by the nature of the pathogen and its location
within the mammary tissues, the host reaction to the
pathogen and the pharmacokinetics and mechanism of
action of the drug. Because individual cases of mastitis are
usually caused by a single bacterial species, the therapeutic
agent selected should be as specific as possible
Accordingly,
 antimicrobial
combinations
and
broad-spectrum antibiotics should be avoided. Collection
of samples for isolation of the causative organism and
determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern
should be completed before treatment commences.
However, the clinical signs and the herd history may
indicate which agent is most likely to be involved and
treatment  of  clinical mastitis usually begins before
identification of the causal agent. Treatment can be
changed, if necessary, in the light of in vitro antibiotic
sensitivitytesting.
The effectiveness of antimicrobial drugs for treating
mastitis caused by Escherichia coli is considered to be
questionable because the main clinical manifestations of
the condition relate to endotoxin activity and the
subsequent release of inflammatory mediators.In
experimental studies of acute E. coli mastitis, significant
improvement in recovery rates was not demonstrable
following antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, the rate of
2232
spontaneous recovery in subacute and mild infections with
E. coli may approach 90%. Treatment with oxytocin along
with frequent stripping of the mammary gland may be as
beneficial as the administration of antibiotics.

effective and tetracyclines up to 75% less effective against
staphylococci when tested in a medium containing milk
(Sandholm, 1995).
2234
Apart from resistance to penicillin encountered in
staphylococci, many pathogens of the mammary gland
remain susceptible to the majority of antimicrobial agents.
Although an ideal chemotherapeutic agent is not available
for the treatment of mastitis, antimicrobial compounds
currently used are presented in Table 93.1.
Antibiotic resistance
The resistance of staphylococci to antibiotics is a major
obstacle to the successful treatment of mastitis in dairy
cattle. Although there are many reasons for the failure of
treatment
  in   staphylococcal
1mastitis, production of
β-lactamase by  certain
1staphylococcalstrainsis the
principal
reason
for
failure.Theprevalenceof
penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus differs from country
to country. Approximately 20% of strains isolated in
Norway were resistant to penicillin (Brun, 1998); 36% of
strains tested were resistant in a study conducted in a
number of European countries, the US and Zimbabwe (de
Oliveira et al., 2000). In a study conducted in Sudan, 73%
ofS.aureus
 isolates
exhibitedmultipleresistance
(Kuwajock et al., 1999). Resistance to macrolide
antimicrobial agents which are commonly used for the
treatment of S. aureus mastitis is much less prevalent than
resistance to penicillin, with rates of 14 to 17% being
reported. The use of cloxacillin may select for
methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
Antibiotic therapy in lactating cows
During lactation, antimicrobial therapy is generally used
for treatment of clinical mastitis, whereas dry cow therapy
2235
is employed for controlling subclinical disease. Mastitis
caused by S. agalactiae is exceptional as both clinical and
subclinical disease can be successfully treated during
lactation. Streptococcus agalactiae is usually treated by
the intramammary route, with success rates approaching
100%. Saturation therapy can be used to eradicate the
disease from some herds. This entails identification and
treatment of all infected cows combined with strict
hygienic measures to prevent the spread of infection. Any
cows still infected after this regime will require further
treatment. A second option entails treating all lactating
cows in the herd.
Treatment of S. aureus infections during lactation results
in clinical recovery rates of 30 to 60%. However, complete
elimination of the organism is rarely achieved during
lactationand invariablyrequires drycowtherapy.
Treatment of subclinical mastitis during lactation is usually
considered uneconomic although recent work by Swinkels
et al. (2005a, b) suggests that treatment may be profitable
in some herds. Antibiotic treatment of mycoplasmal
mastitis is generally not effective although the successful
treatment of an outbreak of M. californicum and M.
canadense mastitis with a combination of intramammary
chlortetracycline and intramuscular tylosin has been
reported (Mackie et al., 2000). There is uncertainty about
the value of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of E. coli
mastitis. However, when treatment is given early enough
to limit endotoxin production, antibiotics may improve
recovery rates during the early postpartum period when a
degree of immunosuppression may be present. In addition,
in cases of acute coliform mastitis in which bacteraemia
2236
develops, systemic antimicrobial therapy may be required
(Wenz et al., 2001).
Dry cow therapy
Administration  of  intramammary  antibiotics  at  the
beginning of the dry period is used for the treatment of
mastitis caused by contagious pathogens, principally S.
aureus. Treatment of subclinical cases of mastitis due to
environmental organisms such as S. uberis, which are
detected late in lactation, may be deferred until the dry
period. Rates of clearance of S. aureus achieved with dry
cow therapy range from 25 to 75%. Treatment is unlikely
to be successful in older cows, and in cows with high
somatic cell counts when infection has persisted and when
more than one quarter is infected.
Other therapeutic measures
To combat the effects of endotoxin, supportive therapy in
the form of intravenous fluids and anti-inflammatory drugs
is important in the treatment of peracute and acute E. coli
mastitis. Oxytocin, in combination with hand stripping,
assists in the removal of organisms, their toxins and
inflammatory debris. In addition, oxytocin has been found
to be as effective as antibiotics for treating experimentally
induced S. aureus mastitis (Knight et al.， 20005)
Homeopathic, herbal and other remedies are used for the
treatment of mastitis but their efficacy is difficult to assess
due to lack of objective published data.
Prevention and control
2237
Measures appropriate for the prevention and control of
bovine mastitis differ depending on whether the causative
organisms are  contagious or environmental in  origin.
Although some measures such as a correctly functioning
milking machine are useful in the prevention of
predisposing conditions, it is essential that the major
pathogens causing mastitis on a farm are identified in order
to formulate effective control strategies. A general plan for
the control of bovine mastitis is presented in Box 93.6.
Contagious mastitis
The reservoir of infection for contagious mastitis is
infected cows and measures aimed at elimination of
infection from the mammary glands are of major
importance in control.
The efficacy of dry cow antibiotic therapy depends on the
effective against up to 80% of streptococcal infections but is
effective against an average of only So% of S. aureus
infections.
· Elimination of teat lesions helps to reduce colonization of
the teat skin, especially by S. aureus.
· Culling persistently-infected cows is important for the
control of staphylococcal mastitis and for the control of
mycoplasmal mastitis.
Box 93.6 Control plan for bovine mastitis
· Properly maintained milking equipment
· Hygienic milking practices
· Post-milking teat disinfection
· Antibiotic therapy for clinical cases and for dry
cows
2238
Culling of persistently-infected animals
Prevention of new infections requires measures to exclude
introduction of pathogens into the teat and to reduce
exposure of the teats to pathogens.
· Correctly maintained milking equipment minimizes liner slip
and incorrect vacuum levels. A properly functioning milking
machine reduces the risk of introducing pathogens into the
teat canal because of vacuum fluctuations and abnormal
pressure gradients within the teats. In addition, milking
machine performance can directly affect teat tissues.
Prevention of minor lesions such as hyperkeratosis of the
teat orifice helps to reduce the incidence of mastitis. The
milking machine cluster can transmit contagious pathogens
and efficient designs can reduce transmission. Research
suggests that low-volume claws, absence of air transmission
and low milk-flow rates increase transfer of pathogens
between teats (Woolford, 1995)
Hygienic milking practices, which include washing visibly
dirty teats with a disinfectant solution, followed by drying
with paper towels, and effective washing and disinfection of
the milking machine, reduce the likelihood of infection.
· Effective post-milking teat dipping or spraying is a major
control measure for contagious mastitis. A limited number of
chemical disinfectants can be used as teat dips. These
include  chlorine-releasing
 compounds, 
iodophors,
quaternary  ammonium compounds and  chlorhexidine
gluconate. The range of suitable disinfectants available is
limited because teat dips should fulfil a number of criteria in
order to be useful and safe. They should be non-irritating
and non-toxic. In addition, they should remain active in the
presence of organic matter such as milk and should not be
absorbed into the tissues or leave undesirable residues in
milk.
· Milking clinically affected cows last reduces the likelihood
of transmission of infection. If it is not possible to segregate
2239
clinically affected cows, disinfection of milk clusters
immediately after removal from an affected cow or use of
spread of infection.

pathogen   transmission
are
summarized in Fig. 93.1. Increasing the resistance of the
cow through vaccinationwould be an obvious way of
preventing and controlling pathogens causing contagious
mastitis. Although research is continuing into vaccines
against S. aureus and a commercial inactivated vaccine is
available in the USA, efficacy of such vaccines is limited
and their use is unlikely to be economically worthwhile
where the prevalence of S.aureus mastitis has been
reduced using other established control measures.
Environmental mastitis
Reduction of the number of pathogens in the environment
depends on maintenance of satisfactory conditions while
cows are housed or at pasture. Housing facilities should be
correctly designed and well maintained for both lactating
and dry cows. Facilities for dry cows and those that are
calving are especially important for the control of E. coli
mastitis as, in many instances, acquisition of infection
occurs just before calving. Some important measures for
reducing the reservoir of pathogens in the environment of
the cow include the following:
·Provision of housing facilities designed to ensure correct
lying behaviour with good cubicle usage to avoid teat
injuries.
·Clean, dry bedding minimizes the multiplication of
pathogens. Bacterial numbers are lower in dry inorganic
2240
bedding such as sand or mats than in organic bedding such
as straw or sawdust.
·Well ventilated buildings prevent wet conditions which
encourage the build-up of potential pathogens.
Reduction of new infections can be achieved by using
· Correctly functioning milking equipment to prevent the
introduction of environmental pathogens into the teat canal
and udder.
·Internal teat seals at drying off reduce the rate of new
(Woolford et al., 1998;Berry and Hillerton, 2007). Dry cow
antibiotic therapy can also be helpful in the prevention of
o  a o  o s   s 
mastitis-producing bacteria of environmental origin
·Keeping animals standing after milking until the teat
sphincter has fully closed may decrease the risk of infection.
This can be achieved by feeding animals after milking.
·Teat dipping before milking is reported to reduce new
infection rates with environmental pathogens by as much as
50% in some studies; in other studies improvement was not
observed.
·A commercial vaccine is available for preventing mastitis
caused by E. coli. This vaccine is a rough mutant E. cofi
strain which lacks the O antigen and consists only of core
antigen. This core antigen, which is highly conserved among
Gram-negative bacteria, is composed of lipid A and some
common core polysaccharides. The core antigen accounts
forthe cross-protection afforded by this vaccine against a
wide range of Gram-negative bacteria (Dosogne et af.,
2002). However, although vaccination of cows during the
dry period and early lactation reduces the severity of clinical
coliform mastitis, it does not protect against infection and
does not always reduce the incidence of clinical mastitis
(Wilson et af.,2007). Another benefit of vaccination,in
addition to reduced severity of clinical disease, is reduced
loss of milk production following clinical infection in
vaccinated cows (Wilson et af., 2008). Commercial vaccines
2241
against streptococci causing bovine mastitis are not available
but research is ongoing into the development of vaccines for
S. uberis, including investigation of T cell responses (Denis
et af., 2009). The stimulation of cell-mediated immune
defences in combination with a humoral response may also
be important for the development of vaccines against S.
aureus (Denis et af., 2009).

Disinfection, biosecurity and other aspects of disease
control
Advances in the development of chemotherapeutic drugs
and effective vaccines have provided the veterinary
profession with improved methods for controlling and
preventing many infectious diseases in animals, especially
in  intensively-reared animals. Despite these advances,
infectious diseases remain a major obstacle to increased
productivity. As a consequence of the limitations of
chemotherapy and vaccination for controlling transmission
of infectious agents, improved biosecurity measures
combined with effective disinfection  programmes are
recognized as essential components of animal management
systems on farms and production units in many regions of
the world.
Many infectious diseases of animals are spread not only
directly by the infected animal but also indirectly, through
environmental
contamination.
Intensive
 management
systems may contribute to the occurrence of enteric and
respiratory diseases, particularly  in  young animals.
Effective control measures are required to minimize the
spreadof  infectious
agents
in
susceptible
 animal
populations, especially when intensive production systems
are used. Vaccination is one of the preferred methods for
preventing infectiousdiseases
Scausedby specific
pathogens. However, many major diseases cannot as yet be
controlled by vaccination. In addition, some ‘complex
2251
  o     
controlled by this method.
Measures for the control of infectious diseases in domestic
animals include accurate identification of animals and
restrictions on their movement either into or within a
country. Following an outbreak of an infectious disease,
isolation of infected and in-contact animals is used to limit
spread. If the disease is exotic or subject to a national
eradication programme, laboratory testing of clinically
affected animals is followed by slaughter of infected and
in-contact animals. For endemic infectious diseases,
vaccination,
disinfection,
chemotherapy
and
chemoprophylaxis are employed selectively, depending on
the aetiological agents and the methods applicable for their
control. In most countries, the control measures applied to
a particular disease relate to its status within the country,
its
 economlc
 importance
both
 nationally
and
intermationally,  and
its public health significance.
Preventive treatment and control measures appropriate for
particular infectious agents are presented in Table 94.1.
Despite the 
availabilitv

range
of
chemo-therapeutic drugs and a large number of effective

cause
substantial  losses in animal populations  worldwide.  In
addition to losses as a result of mortality, there are costs
arising from decreased productivity of meat, milk and
eggs, reproductive failure and treatment programmes.

Movement of animals for sale, breeding, restocking
or
competitive events often contributes to the spread of
2253
infectious agents. In addition to sick animals exhibiting
clinical signs, subclinically affected animals may shed
infectious agents. Carrier animals, which appear clinically
normal, can also shed pathogens intermittently. The role of
animal feeds in disease transmission has become a topic of
intermational  importance
 following  the  unexpected
appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in
British cattle. The extreme resistance of the agent of BSE
to thermal and chemical inactivation renders recycling
food of animal origin an undesirable practice, especially if
derived from ruminants.
Survival of infectious agents in the environment
Infectious agents shed in excretions or secretions of
animals, or present in products of animal origin, may
remain  viable for long periods  in the environment.
Buildings, transport vehicles, soil, pasture, water and
fomites may become contaminated by the faeces or urine
of infected animals containing bacterial or viral pathogens.
Considerable variation in the survival times of animal
pathogens in the environment is recorded (Fig. 94.2).
Survival times, however, are influenced by many factors
including the number of infectious agents excreted by an
infected animal, the availability of nutrients, competition
from other microorganisms in the same environment and
other microenvironmental factors such as the type and
amount of organic matter present, temperature, pH,
humidity and exposure to ultraviolet light.

and in conditions which suit the pathogen's requirements
they may survive for more than one year (Quinn and
Markey, 2001). Prions and bacterial é
endospores exhibit

factors.
Scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenates mixed with
soil and packed
in
  perforated  Petri   dishes retained
infectivity for more than 3 years when buried in soil
(Brown and Gajdusek, 1991). The endospores of Bacillus
anthracis are considered to be among the most resistant
microbial forms encountered in soil. Annual soil sampling
on an island off the coast of Scotland, where endospores of
B. cnthracis were released in 1942 during biological
weapons trials in World War II, showed that endospore
2256
numbers were declining slowly (Manchee et al., 1994)
More than 40 years after their release, viable endospores
were demonstrable in the top layer of soil. A solution of
formaldehyde in sea water was used to decontaminate the
island.
Transmission of infectious agents
Infectious agents can be transmitted from an infected
animal to a susceptible animal by contact, ingestion.
inhalation, through bite wounds and sometimes by other
routes (Fig. 94.1). The modes of spread, the number of
infectious agents shed by an infected animal and the
        
the rate at which the infectious disease spreads and the
efficiency of control measures implemented by the owner
of a farm or production unit, or by veterinary intervention
at local, national or international level. Insect vectors,
which contribute to the dissemination of infectious agents,
together with wildlife reservoirs of infectious agents
(either mammals or birds), often limit the efficacy of
disease control measures and, in some instances, render
them ineffective.
The impact of infectious diseases on intensively-reared
animals such as pigs and poultry is recognized as one of
the major limiting factors relating to the
economic production of these species.The ease with which
infectious agents can spread between farms may be
reduced and in some instances eliminated by the
implementation of effective biosecurity measures. These
measures are designed to carefully regulate movement of
livestock, animal feed, staff and visitors between farms,
2257
thereby limiting the risks of disease transmission. Within
farms, the spread of endemic disease can be minimized by
isolation
of
sick
animals,
chemotherapy,
chemoprophylaxis,  vaccination  and practical  measures
such as cleaning and disinfection of contaminated
buildings, equipment and transport vehicles. Where
feasible, appropriate measures for the control of wild birds,
rodents, insects and 
1companion animals shouldbe
implemented (Fig. 94.1).
Biosecurity
The term ^biosecurity' includes a wide range of measures
aimed at preventing or limiting exposure of domesticated
animals on a farm or in a production unit to microbial
pathogens
from outside
sources. It  also  includes
procedures for preventing or limiting the spread of
infectious diseases among animals on a farm, in kennels, in
poultry production units or wherever animals are housed or
reared in close contact with each other. Infectious agents
      n  
infected animals, through contaminated feed, by vectors
and from environmental sources. An effective biosecurity
programme has many components, all aimed at ensuring
that the risks of healthy animals acquiring infection are
minimized.
Components of a biosecurity programme include diverse
issues ranging from design, location and environment of
farm buildings to the purchase of animals, feed supplies
and regulation of employees, transport vehicles, service
personnel and people visiting the farm either casually or
2258
operation, the greater the need for effective biosecurity
measures. Joint purchasing of expensive items of farm
equipment may be desirable economically but raises many
problems when such equipment is moved from farms with
questionable standards of animal production to farms with
high management standards. The well known adage ^A
chain is only as strong as its weakest link’ applies to the
design and implementation of biosecurity procedures. Any
lapse in the implementation of an effective biosecurity
of the animals involved. A properly formulated and
implemented  biosecurity programme incorporates those
aspects of disease control measures designed to limit the
transmission ofinfectious agents (Fig. 94.3).

staff in diagnostic laboratories, including support staff.
Exclusion of suspect animals from a country, quarantine at
point of entry, isolation of infected and in-contact animals
on the farm, followed by diagnostic testing and, if

national governments and by individual animal owners.
Schemes for the diagnosis, control and prevention of
important endemic diseases of animals are formulated by
national governments and implemented by veterinary
personnel at the district level and at farm level. In the
event of an outbreak of infectious disease subject to
government control, a rigorous testing policy, followed by
slaughter of infected
animals, segregation,
, monitoring and retesting  of
in-contact animals usually applies. Keeping animals free of

the owner. A closed herd or a closed flock is the most
effective method for excluding infectious agents from an
animal population.
Replacement animals should be purchased from reputable
sources where the history of the herd or flock from which
they are derived is known. In addition to the risks
associated with replacement animals, there are inherent
risks linked to animals returning to their farm of origin
following competitions, sales, hospitalization or similar
events, where close contact with other animals is
unavoidable.
Imported animals should be quarantined at point of arrival
in   a  country   and  subjected
1to thorough clinical
2262
examination  combined with appropriate laboratory  test
procedures. Even if assurance as to their health status is
provided at time of purchase in a market, at sales or when
purchased privately, it may be advisable to isolate newly
purchased animals after arrival on the farm for at least 2
weeks to monitor their health status. A limitation of both
quarantine and isolation of animals after purchase relates
to diseases with long incubation periods, such as
paratuberculosis in cattle, scrapie in sheep and rabies in
dogs and cats. Latent viral infections or latent bacterial
infections may not be detectable by clinical examination of
animals following a period of isolation on a farm.
Serological tests or other diagnostic procedures may be

Stud farms have a particular need to ascertain the health
status of all mares and stallions used for breeding
purposes. There are inherent risks associated with the
movement of breeding mares on to a farm. Such animals
should have their vaccination status confirmed in advance
of acceptance by the stud farm and be certified free of
infectionwithTaylorellaequigeni-talis.Streptococcus
equi is a constant source of concern when horses are
brought together for breeding purposes, for competitive
events or for sales.  A thorough clinical examination
together with a detailed clinical history of each animal may
aid in the detection and exclusion of suspect horses at
point of arrival.
Feed
2263
The source and quality of feed for farm animals requires
careful consideration to ensure freedom from microbial
pathogens or toxic factors. Feed such as grain can become
contaminated   during storage  with  viral or bacterial
pathogens before it reaches feed mills. Wild birds and
rodents have been implicated in feed contamination, and
cats shedding oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii in their faeces
can contaminate grain in feed mills or on farms. When fed
to cattle, silage, hay and harvested crops contaminated
with canine faeces containing oocysts of Neospora
caninum can induce multiple abortions in a herd. Grain
and nut crops, harvested during wet seasons, followed by
inappropriate storage conditions, can lead to fungal
proliferation and mycotoxin production in stored feed.
Animal-derived protein should be excluded from the diets
of ruminants due to the association of BSE in cattle with
the feeding of meat-and-bone meal. Because of the risks
associated with swill feeding, this cheap source of food for
pigs should be avoided.
Crops grown by the owner on the farm are sometimes a
source of infectious agents or biological toxins. Listeria
monocytogenes can replicate in the surface layers of poor
quality silage
 and  produce listeriosis  in ruminants.
Botulism in farm animals has been associated with feeding
baled silage. Ergopeptide alkaloids, produced by Claviceps
purpurea growing on standing ryegrasses, rye and other
cereal crops before harvesting, may be present in silage
made from such crops.
Water
2264
The source and quality of water for farm animals may be
influenced by farm location, climatic factors and other
environmental
influences.  As water　 supplies  for
intensively-reared animals such as pigs and poultry are
usually of mains origin, health problems from such a
source are usually of little concern. Contamination of a
clean water supply on a farm can occur due to pollution of
drinkers in buildings or outdoor water troughs by faeces or
urine. Drinkers in grazing areas positioned at low levels

contaminated by wild birds.
For grazing animals, ponds and larger bodies of water may
become contaminated by run-off from slurry spreading or
overflowing slurry tanks. Wildlife, either resident or
migratory, can contaminate ponds with either enteric
pathogens or leptospires. If poultry houses are located
close to lakes or large ponds, migratory water fowl or
seabirds can transmit avian influenza or Newcastle disease
to domestic poultry (Lister, 2008).
Water troughs for grazing animals may attract wildlife.
such as badgers, shedding Mycobacterium bovis in their
urine. Rats shedding leptospires can contaminate water
troughs, and other wildlife reservoirs can transmit a range
of waterborne microbial pathogens to
domestic animals. Raising water troughs for grazing
animals to a level not accessible to wild mammals may
reduce the risk of contamination. Frequent cleaning of
drinkers for intensively-reared animals should form part of
the management system
2265
Environment of domestic animals
The immediate environment of farm animals can have a
Buildings, farm yards, paddocks and other grazing areas
can be planned so as to promote animal health.
Conversely, improper  building 
 design,  inadequate
ventilation and insufficient floor space for the animal
population can predispose  to stressful  environmental
conditions for intensively-reared animals. Temperature
control  is   a   requirement 
for neonatal   pigs  and
newly-hatched chicks. Poultry and pig units should operate
close to their optimal temperatures. Building design should
incorporate  features   which  facilitate   cleaning   and
disinfection at the end of a production cycle or following
an outbreak of disease. Space for isolation facilities should
be an integral part of buildings designed for domestic
mammals. Floors and walls with a moderately smooth
finish facilitate cleaning and minimize trauma to animals
without predisposing to slipping. Food storage areas
designed to exclude rodents and wild birds not only
decrease the risk of food contamination but also limit
waste. Windows, doors and ventilation systems should be
rodent-proof. The installation of waterproof power points
in buildings reduces the risk of electric shocks for
employees. On large farms, consideration should be given
to the inclusion of facilities for washing and disinfecting
vehicles for transportation of animals.
Dusty paddocks and heavily grazed pastures can lead to a
build-up  of Rhodococcus  equi  which  can result  in
suppurative bronchopneumonia in foals up to 4 months of
age. Rough pastures offer cover for many tick species such
2266
as Ixodes ricinus. The acquisition of tick-borne diseases
such as louping ill and tick-borne fever is usually
associated with animals grazing rough pasture.
A secure perimeter fence is an essential component of any
biosecurity system. For pig and poultry units, the fence
should incorporate features suitable for the control of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Perimeter fences around
farms should ensure that grazing animals are contained
within a defined area and not allowed access to adjacent
properties. Cost is a major limiting factor in the erection
and maintenance of effective boundary fences, especially
on large farms.
Vehicular and pedestrian traffic
The control of vehicles calling at farms, especially pig and
poultry enterprises, is a fundamental requirement of
effective farm management. Delivery vehicles transporting
feed, bedding or other supplies should be visibly clean and
drivers should be advised on the biosecurity systems
operating on the farm. Drivers of milk tankers usually
adhere to a defined routine when calling at dairy farms.
Particular attention should be paid to drivers of vehicles
used for collection of animals, slurry tankers and vehicles
used for disposal of animal waste. These drivers should be
given clear instructions on procedures to be followed and,
if necessary, their work should be supervised. Wheel baths
at farm entrances are sometimes used as part of a
biosecurity strategy. Unless they are built to defined
specifications and maintained on a regular basis, their
value as part of a disease control programme is
questionable.
2267
Staff working on the farm, service personnel, veterinarians
and all others on official business should adhere strictly to
the wearing of protective clothing and footwear at all
times. In some instances, waterproof footwear may have to
be provided for  those  visiting
thefarm.Footbaths.
strategically positioned for all pedestrians, should be used
by persons entering the farm, irrespective of their reason
for being present. If farm buildings are arranged as discrete
units, the entrance to each building should have a footbath
at the point of entry. On farms with high levels of
biosecurity, visitors are required to indicate their names
and addresses and sign a register before entering the
premises.
Equipment
The sharing of farm equipment between groups of farmers
with different management standards and different disease
problems in their livestock is an arrangement which should
be avoided. Equipment used for cleaning buildings, slurry
spreading and the transportation of animals are among the
items which should be excluded from joint purchasing
agreements
Animal waste
The form and amount of animal waste generated on a farm
are determined by the number and species of animals
present, building design and the type of material used as
bedding for large animals or as poultry litter. In buildings
with slatted floors, animal waste is
stored in slurry tanks. These tanks should be constructed to
high specifications and have ample capacity to ensure that
2268
overflowing of contents does not occur and they should be
emptied at regular intervals. Slurry spreading is usually
restricted to defined times of the year when ground
conditions are suitable for slurry tankers and when the risk
of run-off is low. In many European countries, slurry
spreading  is restricted
1  by government regulations to
specified times of the year. An interval of up to 2 months
should elapse between the application of slurry to pasture
and the commencement
t of grazing.Alongerinterval
between the application of slurry and the commencement
of grazing may be required if enteric pathogens such as
Salmonella species or pathogenic acid-fast bacteria are
likely to be present in the slurry.
Straw used for bedding animals and litter from poultry
houses should be stored at a site remote from farm
buildings and composted for up to 2 months before
spreading takes place on land used for tillage. Composting
should take place on a site where run-off is minimized by
location and by the design of the holding facility.
Alternatively, the material can be removed at regular
intervals and dispersed on arable land. If an infectious
disease has occurred on the farm from which the bedding
material derived, composting should be carried out for at
least 2 months before dispersal of the material on arable
land.
Wild mammals and birds
Rodents
Rats and mice are often attracted to farm buildings because
they provide shelter in cold weather and because of the
2269
abundance of food available in such buildings. Rodents act
as reservoirs of Salmonella species, and mice often
harbour Salmonella Typhimurium which they excrete in
their faeces. Rats sometimes shed leptospires in their urine
and can transmit these virulent pathogens to domestic
animals and also to humans.
Farm buildings, especially feed storage facilities, should be
designed to exclude rodents. Feed bins should be
rodent-proof and feed spillages should be cleared up
promptly to lessen the attraction of rodents and wild birds
to farm buildings. Strategic use of rodenticides in the
vicinity of farm buildings is an effective method for
controlling rodent populations.
Wild birds
The availability of grain and shelter often attracts wild
birds to farm yards and farm buildings. Migratory
waterfowl can transmit avian influenza and Newcastle
disease to commercial poultry flocks. Native species of
wild birds can transmit microbial pathogens such as
Salmonella species, Yersinia species and Mycoplasma
species to poultry flocks. Poultry houses should have all
openings, including ventilation shafts, covered with wire
mesh to exclude wild birds.
Wildlife
The close interaction between grazing animals and wildlife
can result in the transfer of infectious agents between wild
animals and domestic animals. Farms bordering game
reserves, national parks or other land designated for the
2270
preservation of wildlife species provide an opportunity for
common grazing by domestic and wild ruminants.
Transmission of the foot-and-mouth disease virus from
persistentlyinfected African Cape buffalo to cattle has been
documented. Badgers and possums, which live either on
 qs A l hz o xod so un o s
same general environment as grazing cattle and also share
common diseases such as tuberculosis caused by
Mycobacterium bovis. Transfer of infection to cattle from
badgers or possums terminally ill with tuberculosis can
occur through licking, sniffing or biting moribund animals
on pasture. Nocturnal observations of badger behaviour on
cattle farms have demonstrated that badgers were attracted
to feed sheds, barns, haystacks and cattle troughs in their
search for food (Garnett et al., 2002). It was also noted that
contamination of cattle feed with badger faeces occurred
and that badgers came into close contact with cattle.
Cleaning and disinfection of farm buildings
Effective cleaning and disinfection at the end of a
production cycle or following an outbreak of disease is an
essential component of a biosecurity programme. If carried
out in  a  competent manner,  cleaning  alone  can
substantially reduce the number of pathogens in a building,
thereby decreasing the risk of a heavy challenge to the
animals in that environment. One of the principal reasons
for the failure of a disinfection procedure is the presence of
residual organic matter due to inadequate cleaning.
Accordingly,cleaning
gis a prerequisite for the
implementation of a successful disinfection programme.
Building design and the materials used for construction
influence cleaning methods. Fittings such as food
2271
receptacles and drinkers require special attention. If an
important infectious disease has occurred on the premises,
the system supplying water should be emptied, cleaned and
disinfected.

involved.
Thermal inactivation of microbial pathogens
thermal inactivation (Fig. 94.4). Although both moist and
dry heat can be used for inactivating microorganisms,
moist heat is more effective and requires less time to
achieve inactivation than dry heat. Many vegetative
bacteria are killed in less than 20 seconds by heating at
72°C. At temperatures above 80°C, most vegetative
bacteria are killed within seconds. Bacterial endospores are
remarkably thermostable, and moist heat at 121°C for at
least 15 minutes is required for their destruction. Many
viruses are labile at temperatures close to 7o?C. Canine
parvovirus is a notable exception: a temperature of 100°C
for 1 minute is required to inactivate this resistant virus.
Foot-and-mouth disease virus in  milk can survive
pasteurization at 72°C for 15 seconds and further heating
at 72°C for 5 minutes (Blackwell and Hyde, 1976). The
virus also survives heating at 93°C for 15 seconds in
cream. At temperatures close to 1oo°C, more than 20
minutes may be required to inactivate this resistant virus in
milk (Walker et al., 1984). Heat treatment of milk at
148°or 3 seconds reliably inactivates the virus

The prions that  cause transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies are extremelyresistant tothermal

autoclaving at 132°5 hours may be effective.
Disinfection, antisepsis and sterilization
There are a number of well defined measures that can be
applied for the prevention and control of infectious
diseases within a country or in regions of a country. These
include exclusion of suspect animals, quarantine at point of
entry, and isolation and slaughter of infected animals if
exotic disease is confirmed by clinical or laboratory tests.
When infectious diseases are endemic in a country, control
measures include vaccination,
chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis (Fig. 94.1, Box
94.1). During the implementation of disease eradication
permitted alongside a slaughter policy. Effective control
measures relating to the environment, animal waste and
animal products are central to the success of disease
eradication programmes (Fig. 94.1, Box 94.2). Chemical
decontamination can be used for buildings, equipment,
transport vehicles, footwear and clothing. Heat treatment
of milk, milk products and waste food of animal origin
such as swill, and chemical treatment of fluids, secretions
and excretions, are also essential for effective disease
control.

Disinfection implies the use of physical or chemical
methods for the destruction of microorganisms, especially
potential pathogens, on the surfaces of inanimate objects or
in the environment. Antisepsis can be defined as the
destruction or inhibition of microorganisms on living
tissues by chemicals which are non-toxic and non-irritating
for the tissues. Disinfectants and antiseptics differ
fundamentally from systemically active chemotherapeutic
agents in that they do not exhibit selective toxicity. Most
chemicals used as disinfectants are toxic not only for
microbial pathogens but also for host cells. Disinfectants
are therefore used only to reduce the microbial population
on inanimate surfaces or in organic materials, whereas
antiseptics can be applied topically to living tissues.
Because of the great diversity of microbial pathogens,
complete destruction of bacteria, fungi and viruses by
sterilization requires carefully controlled conditions. Steam
under pressure generating a temperature of 121°C for 20
2276
minutes, dry heat at 160°C for 2 hours or ionizing radiation
(gamma radiation) effectively inactivate conventional
microbial pathogens. Glutaraldehyde and peracetic acid at
specified concentrations are used as sterilizing agents.
Sterilization methods, which require strict adherence to
well-defined procedures, are used for surgical instruments,
fluids for systemic administration, media for culture of
microorganisms, and inactivation of microbial pathogens
in specimens submitted for laboratory identification. In
contrast, disinfection methods used for decontaminating
buildings, equipment, transport vehicles, footwear and
clothing are not implemented to the same strict guidelines.
Characteristics, modes of action and selection of chemical
disinfectants
Although a number of potentially useful physical methods
including dry and moist heat, ionizing radiation and
      
laboratory, at farm level, in clinical facilities and in
locations where animals are assembled for sporting events
or for sale, chemical disinfection procedures find wider
application than physical methods.
Many chemicals with antimicrobial activity can be used
for the inactivation of microbial pathogens in buildings,
stockyards and  transport  vehicles  and on  equipment.
Chemicals used include acids, alkalis, alcohols, aldehydes,
halogens, phenols and quaternary ammonium compounds.
Characteristics of an ideal disinfectant are presented in
Box 94.3. None of the currently available compounds
possesses all of these characteristics. Selection of a
disinfectant agent should be based on its spectrum of
2277
activity, its efficacy and its susceptibility to inactivation by
organic
matter.
Additional
considerations   include
compatibility with soaps and detergents, toxicity for
personnel and animals, contact time required, optimal
temperature, residual activity, corrosiveness, effects on the
environment and cost.

Selection and use of a disinfectant requires consideration
of the infectious agents likely to be present and the
conditions prevailing in the location where microbial
contamination has occurred. If the pathogen that caused
the disease outbreak has been identified, a disinfectant
with known activity against that agent should be selected
(Table 94.3). The activity of complex disinfectants may
vary in accordance with their formulation, and the efficacy
of individual compounds listed in Table 94.3 relates to
their use under ideal conditions. Before the application of a
disinfectant, surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned. This
physical procedure, if properly carried out, removes a high
percentage of accessible infectious agents. Staff training
and proper supervision are essential for the successful
implementation of a cleaning and disinfection programme.
Effective cleaning should always precede disinfection of
buildings, with the exception of those that have housed
animals with major zoonotic diseases such as anthrax.
       
chemical disinfectants (Fig. 94.5). Most vegetative bacteria
andenveloped
1   viruses   are   readily   inactivated   by
disinfectants; fungal spores and non-enveloped viruses are
less susceptible. Mycobacteria and bacterial endospores
are resistant to many commonly used disinfectants. Prions
are extremely resistant to chemical inactivation. High
concentrations of sodium hypochlorite or heated strong
solutions of sodium hydroxide are reported to inactivate
these unconventional infectious agents.
2279
Chemical inactivation of microbial pathogens
Among microbial pathogens, there is considerable
diversity not only in their morphological appearances but
also  in  their  nutritional requirements and  metabolic
activities. It is not surprising, therefore, that these diverse
microorganisms also exhibit wide variation in their
resistance to chemical disinfectants. Among vegetative
bacteria, fungi and viruses there are marked differences in
susceptibility   to many  chemical  compounds.  Some
Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to a number of
commonly
used  disinfectants 
suchasquaternary
ammonium compounds and biguanides. Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia can withstand
treatment with povidone - iodine solutions. Of greater
concern, however, is the increasing number of
Gram-negative bacteria which exhibit acquired resistance
to chemical disinfectants. The ability of some strains of E
coli to inactivate formaldehyde has been reported
Acquired resistance to biguanides, phenolic compounds
and quaternary ammonium compounds has been observed
in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
Because of their complex layered structure and their
unique  chemical components  such as dipicolinic acid,
bacterial endospores are inherently resistant to a wide
range of chemical compounds. They are also capable of
surviving in the environment for prolonged periods and
they are resistant to high temperatures which readily
destroy vegetative bacteria.
Enveloped viruses are moderately susceptible to many
commonly used chemical disinfectants. A number of
2280
non-enveloped viruses exhibit marked resistance to a range
of chemical compounds. Parvoviruses are exceptionally
resistant to chemical inactivation and a limited number of
disinfectants are effective against these non-enveloped
viruses. These viruses are also stable in the environment
and can withstand temperatures up to 1oo?C for short
periods.

chemical disinfectants than vegetative bacteria. Intrinsic
resistance of fungal cells to chemical compounds may
relate to the composition of fungal cell walls which renders
them less permeable than bacterial cells to chemicals such
as cationic compounds and alcohols. Wall thickness and
the presence of glucan and mannoproteins are considered
to be factors in the impermeability of fungal cell walls to
some chemical disinfectants.
. Conventional infectious
agents such as bacteria, fungi and viruses share some
common characteristics including their susceptibility to
inactivation   by   chemical
1disinfectants. A group of
infectious agents, termed unconventional infectious agents,
have characteristics which distinguish them from typical
microbial  pathogens.  These  unconventional  infectious
agents, which have been assigned the name prions, appear
to be devoid of nucleic acid, can infect animals and
humans without inducing a detectable immune response
and exhibit resistance to physical and chemical methods of
inactivation far beyond the most resistant forms of
conventional infectious agents. Prions are implicated in a
group of unusual neurological diseases referred to as
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Currently, it is
widely accepted that prions are composed of altered
protein, and the nature of the denaturation may account in
part for the exceptional resistance of these infectious
agents to physical and chemical methods of inactivation.
2282
As prions have not been isolated like conventional
infectious agents, it is unclear if their resistance derives in
part from innate characteristics of these agents or from
their close association with host tissues which confer
protection against  physical  and  chemical  methods  of
inactivation.

Unlike antibiotics or sulphonamides which usually exert
their effects on specific target sites within the bacterial

especially in the higher lipid content of the Gram-negative

in their susceptibility to chemical inactivation. Although
staphylococcal cell walls normally have a low lipid

increased resistance to phenolic compounds and to other
disinfectants. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, Proteus

immersed in the solution. Acquired bacterial resistance to
disinfectants has also been observed in both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria in recent years. The constant
repetitive use of some chemical compounds in particular
buildings, such as hospitals or clinics, may contribute to
the selection of bacteria resistant to such chemicals. To
minimize the risk of resistance developing in such
circumstances, rotational use of different classes of
disinfectants has been recommended.

resistance
to
chemical
compounds, mycobacteria occupy a position between
Gram-negative bacteria and bacterial endospores (Fig
94.5). Mycobacterial resistance to disinfectants is linked to
the cell wall composition of these bacteria; their high lipid
content renders them hydrophobic, thereby preventing
hydrophilic
agents
from
 entering
the cells.  Other
components of mycobacterial cell walls which distinguish
them from  conventional
bacteria include mycolic acid
derivatives and mycobacterial peptidoglycans. Differences
in the resistance of mycobacteria have been reported, with

peroxygen compound indicated that it was ineffective as a
mycobactericidal agent (Griffiths et al., 1999). Peracetic
acid, however, has been reported to be effective against
mycobacteria.

suitable   halogen
disinfectants   can    be

Bacterial endospores
Endospore-producing bacteria include Clostridium species
and Bacillus species. Bacterial endospores are much more
resistant  than  their corresponding  vegeta-tive cells to
adverse environmental conditions, heat and chemical
disinfectants. The ability of particular bacteria such as
clostridia and Bacillus anthracis to form spores confers on
them unique attributes which include prolonged survival
under adverse conditions and resistance to chemical
disinfectants. Although disinfectants such as alcohols,
biguanides, phenolic
compounds
andquaternary
2289
ammonium compounds may be sporostatic, they are not
sporicidal.
Chemical disinfectants with sporicidal activity include
alkylating agents, oxidizing agents and halogens (Table
94.4). Although some uncertainty remains about the
sporicidal activity of a limited number of these chemicals,
many are potent sporicides. The ability of formaldehyde
and    glutaraldehyde   to   inactivate    endospores
well-established. Likewise, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine
dioxide  and  other  chlorine-releasing  compounds  are
effective sporicides in the presence of limited amounts of
organic matter. The effectiveness of the oxidizing agents
hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid as sporicidal agents
may be influenced by the concentration at which they are
used and also by the presence of organic matter.

endospores are not well defined. Individual chemicals may
first damage extermal endospore structures before entering
the core where they may react with DNA or with enzymes
required for outgrowth and return to the vegetative state.
Fungal pathogens
Although
many
chemical
disinfectants
have
both
antibacterial and antifungal activity, bacteria and fungi
have many distinct structural features. Fungal cell walls
contain chemical compounds such as glucan polymers,
mannoproteins and chitin. The fungal cell membrane is
rich in ergosterol which is the target site of many
antifungal drugs. Because of the complexity of their cell
walls, fungal pathogens are more resistant to inactivation
by chemical disinfectants than non-sporulating bacteria.
2291
The antifungalactivityof quaternary ammonium
compounds is reported to depend on the type of compound
used, its concentration and the fungal cells being treated
Phenolic  compounds with  antifungal  activity include
halogenated phenols but many phenolic compounds are

formulations have  strong  fungicidal  activity.  Sodium

against spores of pathogenic fungi. Twelve disinfectants

chlorhexi-dine and glutaraldehyde were evaluated for their
ability toinactivate spores of Microsporum canis in
naturally-infected feline hair (Rycroft and McLay, 1991)
Sodium  hypochlorite,  benzalkonium  chloride  and
glutaraldehyde-based formulations were the most effective
disinfectants. Phenolic compounds, ethyl alcohol and
anionic detergents were ineffective against these fungal
spores.
Viruses
Many chemical compounds which are bactericidal are also
virucidal. However, when the activity of these
disinfectants is examined more closely, major differences
are evident. With the exception of mycobacteria, most
vegetative bacteria are more readily  inactivated by
2292
chemical compounds than are non-enveloped viruses.
Enveloped viruses are usually considered to have a pattern
of susceptibility similar to that of vegetative bacteria (Fig.
94.5). Many viruses shed by infected animals are found in
association with organic matter such as faeces, exudates or
body fluids which may shield them from chemical
inactivation. In addition, some resistant animal viruses,
notably canine and feline parvoviruses, are shed in
enormous numbers, thereby enhancing their opportunity to
infect susceptible animals in the immediate environment
and also facilitating transfer by vehicle or vectors to other
distant locations. Viral diseases of animals which are
spread mainly by contaminated surfaces, equipment or
fomites are more amenable to control by chemical
disinfectants than viral infections spread primarily through
aerosols, secretions, body fluids or animal products. The
ability of a virucide to function in an effective manner is
influenced by many factors including the nature of virus
particles present, the presence or absence of organic
matter, contact time, the concentration of chemical used
and
1the environmental
temperature.  Ultimately, the
structure of the virus particles, the antiviral spectrum of the
chemical employed and the environment in which the
interaction between the viruses and the chemical takes
place determine
etheoutcome.Selectionanduseof
chemicaldisinfectants
S  for   particular   circumstances
requires an understanding of the viral pathogens likely to
be present, the prevailing conditions in the building or
premises requiring
 decontamination, the spectrum of
activity of the virucide selected, its safety for workers and
the cost involved.
2293
The sites and modes of action of chemical disinfectants
which either inhibit viruses or have virucidal activity are
summarized in Table 94.5. Although acids and alkalis have
limited activity against many viruses, their ability to
inactivate the virus of foot-and-mouth disease is of
considerable importance. This non-enveloped picornavirus
resists inactivation by many commonly used disinfectants
but is inactivated by sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide,
citric acid and acetic acid. Chemicals with limited
virucidal activity include alcohols, biguanides, oxidizing
agents such as hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium
compounds and many phenolic compounds. Aldehydes,
ethylene oxide, β-propiolactone and halogens, especially
sodium
hypochlorite
and other
chlorine-releasing
compounds, are effective virucides. Structural and
functional components of enveloped and non-enveloped
viruses which are targets of chemical disinfectants are
shown in Fig. 94.8. The virucidal activity of complex
disinfectants is often determined by their exact formulation
and the concentration of each active constituent
incorporated into the final preparation.
Prions
Unlike conventional infectious agents, prions are resistant
to the majority of chemical compounds that have the
ability to inactivate bacteria, bacterial endospores, fungi
and viruses. The basis of this exceptional resistance is not
well understood but probably relates to the fact that prions
modification by organic solvents, oxidizing agents,
phenolic compounds, some halogens and alkylating agents.
2294
Experimental procedures  indicate  the  exceptional
resistance of the agents which cause transmissible
degenerative encephalopathies to physical and chemical
methods of inactivation. Based on published data from
many sources, Tables 94.6 and 94.7 summarize the
physical and chemical methods that have been evaluated
for the inactivation of agents that cause transmissible
degenerative encephalopathies.
The lack of consistency among the scientific reports

causal
agents
of
transmissible spongiform
 s   d n  n  snd
biological specimens used for evaluation and also to the
methods used to determine whether or not inactivation was
achieved (Taylor, 2004).
Prions have been shown to be resistant to several physical
methods of inactivation including dry heat, moist heat,
gamma irradiation, microwave irradiation and ultraviolet
irradiation. From the data presented in Table 94.6, it is
evident that the aetiological agents involved are generally
not inactivated by dry heat at a temperature of 200?C or
moist heat at temperatures close to 130°C. The ashing of
brain samples at 600?C failed to fully inactivate the scrapie
agent (Brown et al., 2ooo). Treatment of macerated
hamster brain infected with the 263K strain of
hamster-adapted scrapie at 1,000°C for 15 minutes
completely inactivated this strain of scrapie agent (Brown
et al., 2004). In published reports, paradoxical results
which indicate enhancement of the thermostability of the
BSE agent when autoclaved at 138?C compared with
134°C are attributed to smearing and drying of macerated
2295
brain tissue on glass surfaces before autoclaving took place
(Taylor, 2000). Prior fixation of tissue in ethyl alcohol or
formalin has been shown to enhance the resistance of
scrapie agents to inactivation.
Hydrochloric acid, alkylating agents, detergent, organic
solvents and oxidizing agents are ineffective against the
causal
 agents
of
 transmissible  spongiform
encephalopathies (Table 94.7). Extensive investigations
with a wide range of chemical compounds gradually
yielded relevant data on the inactivation of these resistant
agents. It has been reported that when PrpSc is bound to
metallic surfaces it is more resistant to inactivation than
when present in tissue. Sodium hypochlorite solutions and
heated sodium hydroxide inactivated the BSE agent, the
CJD agent and the scrapie agent. Inactivation of the CJD
agent and the scrapie agent occurred following treatment
with 2.5% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite for 1 hour (Brown et
al., 1986). Further evaluation of the activity of sodium
hypochlorite   demonstrated    that    solutions    yielding
concentrations of available chlorine from 8,250 to 16,500
ppm inactivated the BSE agent. Autoclaving the scrapie
agent at 121°C for 30 minutes in the presence of 2 mol/
litre sodium hydroxide resulted in inactivation of the agent
(Taylor et al., 1997).

Studies on the efficacy of hyperbaric rendering procedures
for the inactivation of the BSE agent and the scrapie agent
have yielded equivocal results (Schreuder et al., 1998).
Thermal inactivation procedures for these agents using
moist heat are not yet conclusively established. The BSE
agent is considered to be more resistant to heat inactivation
procedures than the scrapie agent (Schreuder et al., 1998)
Although
 the
 aetiological

exhibit
exceptional
resistance to chemical inactivation, high concentrations of
available chlorine released by sodium hypochlorite and
sodium hydroxide at a concentration of 2 mol/litre, heated

these

Acids
2300
Acidic conditions tend to inhibit bacterial growth, and
many organic acids are employed as preservatives in food
and pharmaceuticals. The antimicrobial activity of acids is
usually pH dependent. Organic acids are highly effective
against Gram-positive bacteria but not as active against
Gram-negativebacteria.
Viruses show wide variation in their susceptibility to low
pH levels, often related to structural features. The capsid
proteins of some viruses, which are markedly inhibited by
acidic conditions, may
undergo  changes in  their
conformationalstate whentreated with organic acids.
Many acids including citric acid and phosphoric acid
inactivate the virus of foot-and-mouth disease. Mineral
acids may also be used for this purpose but they are
corrosive and hazardous for workers. Hydrochloric acid
inactivates human rotavirus and vesicular stomatitis virus.
At a 2.5% concentration, hydrochloric acid has been used
for inactivating the endospores of Bacillus anthracis on
hides.
In food processing industries, mineral acids are used
extensively as cleaning agents for removing lime scale.
milk stone and other alkaline deposits in pipes and milking
machines and on surfaces. The choice of acid may be
determined by the types of component being treated and by
their ability to withstand high temperatures and acidity
Acetic acid, an effective antibacterial agent, can be used at
concentrations up to 0.5% for treating wounds infected
with Pseudomonas species. This organic acid, which is
non-irritating at low concentrations, has been used
2301
topically for the treatment of chronic bacterial conditions
including otitis externa.
Organic acids and mineral acids have a defined but limited
role in disinfection procedures. Their antimicrobial activity
usually correlates with low pH values and they tend to act
slowly. Because strong mineral acids are hazardous for
workers, eye protection and rubber gloves should be worn
when handling these acids.
Alcohols
The   antimicrobial  spectrum    of   alcohols  includes
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria,
some fungal pathogens and some enveloped viruses. They
are not sporicidal and non-enveloped viruses are resistant
The bactericidal property of alcohols increases with carbon
chain length but water solubility decreases. Ethyl alcohol
and isopropyl alcohol are widely used as disinfectants. The
presence of water increases the bactericidal activity of
alcohol and the most effective concentration of ethyl
alcohol is approximately 70%. Alcohols denature protein,
are lipid solvents and exhibit rapid antimicrobial activity
against vegetative bacteria. The antifungal activity of
alcohols is attributed to reduction in water activity to
below the levels at which fungal enzymes, membranes and
cells retain structural and functional stability (Maillard.
2004). Because they evaporate rapidly, alcohols exert no
residual effects following topical application.
Alcohols are often used alone for topical disinfection
Solutions of iodine or chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol are
employed for the preoperative disinfection of skin sites.
2302
Published data indicate that preoperative application of 2%
chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol is superior to an
aqueous solution of 10% povidone - iodine for preventing
surgical - site infection in human patients (Darouiche et
al., 2010). In comparison with other disinfectants, alcohols
are inexpensive, relatively non-toxic, non-tainting and
colourless. The antimicrobial activity of alcohols is limited
in the presence of organic matter, especially when dried on
surfaces. Because of their solvent activity, rubber and
some plastic material may be damaged by alcohol. Due to
their inflammability, alcohols should not be applied to
surfaces close to naked flames
Aldehydes
As a group, aldehydes are highly reactive chemicals with a
wide
  antimicrobial
spectrum.
Three  aldehydes,
formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and ortho phthalaldehyde
are used as disinfectants. A number of chemicals including
aldehydes, ethylene
oxide andβ-propiolactone are
alkylating agents: they inactivate enzymes and other
proteins with labile hydrogen atoms such as sulphydryl
groups. Aldehydes react readily with amino, carboxyl,
sulphydryl and hydroxyl groups on proteins, causing
irreversible changes in protein structure. Some aldehydes
react with amino groups on purine and pyrimidine bases in
nucleic acids and with peptidoglycan. Formaldehyde
occurs as a gas which is freely soluble in water and also as
a solid. At room temperature, formaldehyde polymerizes,
forming
a
colourless
 solid
1  material
called
paraformaldehyde. Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is an
aqueous   solution   containing  approximately   38%
formaldehyde (w/w) with methyl alcohol added to delay
2303
polymerization. Vapour-phase formaldehyde can be used
 o  s   
produced by evaporation of formalin,
by the addition of formalin to potassium permanganate
crystals or by heating paraformaldehyde. The antimicrobial
spectrum of formaldehyde is wide. It is effective against
vegetative bacteria including mycobacteria, endospores.
fungi and viruses but it acts more slowly than
glutaraldehyde. Apart from its use as a disinfectant,
formaldehyde is used in the preparation of veterinary
lameness in cattle and sheep. Even at low levels, the
irritating vapour and pungent odour of formaldehyde is
evident. It is toxic and the inhalation of vapour may
sensitize
workers. The use of formaldehyde as a
broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent is declining due to its
known    toxicity    and    its    potential    carcinogenicity
Chlorine-releasing agents should not be used in association
with formaldehyde as bis-chloromethylether, a potent
carcinogen, is produced by the reaction of formaldehyde
with hydrochloric acid, sodium hypochlorite or other
chlorine-containing compounds.
Glutaraldehyde, a
dialdehyde,  is  usually supplied
commercially as a 2%, 25% or 50% acidic solution
Although stable at acid pH, it is more active at values close
to pH 8. It has high microbiocidal activity against
vegetative bacteria, bacterial endospores, fungal spores
and viruses. Unlike formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde reacts
rapidly with microbial pathogens. For high - level
disinfection, glutaraldehyde is used as a 2% solution. It
reacts with proteins, with components of bacterial cell
walls and with bacterial endospores. Although recognized
2304
as one of the most effective sporicidal agents, its mode of
interaction with these resistant structures is not clearly
defined. In  addition to
itsdisinfectantproperties,
glutaraldehyde is used for specimen fixation in electron
It is widely used for the sterilization of thermosensitive
equipment which cannot be subjected to heat sterilization.
Even at low levels, glutaraldehyde vapour is irritating for
the eyes and mucous membranes. Some workers exposed
to  glutaraldehyde develop allergic  contact dermatitis,
asthma and rhinitis. Concerns about the risks of exposure
to glutaraldehyde have resulted in a marked decline in its
use as a broad-spectrum disinfectant, and altermative
chemicals with comparable efficiency and fewer toxic side
effects are being considered.
Ortho-phthalaldehyde, an aromatic aldehyde, has been
evaluated as a potential replacement for glutaraldehyde.
This recently introduced chemical has marked bactericidal
and virucidal activity but its sporicidal activity is less than
that    of glutaraldehyde.
An
advantage
of
ortho-phthalaldehyde over other aldehydes is its lipophilic
activity which facilitates its uptake through the cell walls
of Gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria (Moore and
Payne, 2004). Further work 1s required to determine safety
and efficacy aspects of this aromatic aldehyde
Alkalis
The antimicrobial activity of alkalis is related to hydroxyl
ion concentration. Alkalis are frequently used to increase
the pH of industrial sanitizers and cleaners. Sodium
2305
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and sodium carbonate
(washing soda) are the alkalis most often employed for
cleaning surfaces of buildings and vehicles; calcium
hydroxide (slaked  lime) is S
 sometimes
susedfor
whitewashing surfaces of buildings following an outbreak
of an infectious disease. At high concentrations these
chemicals have marked microbiocidal properties. Caustic
alkaline solutions are effective against many
viruses
including foot-and-mouth disease virus, adenoviruses and
swine vesicular disease virus. Although sodium carbonate
at a 4% concentration is used primarily as a cleaning agent,
it is particularly effective against foot-and-mouth disease
virus. At concentrations over 5%, sodium hydroxide has a
wide
 antimicrobial
spectrum
including

endospores. Prions, which are resistant to most chemical
decontamination procedures, are inactivated by treatment
minutes. Both sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide
are corrosive for metals and hazardous for workers. All
workers using strong alkaline solutions should be informed
of their caustic nature and should wear eye protection,
rubber gloves and protective clothing.
Ammonium hydroxide, described as a weak base,
inactivates coccidial oocysts which are resistant to the
majority of  standard   chemical disinfectants.  Aqueous
solutions of this weak base, even at low concentrations.
have potent antibacterial activity. Strong solutions of
ammonium hydroxide emit intense pungent fumes.
Biguanides
2306
This group of cationic compounds includes chlorhexidine.
alexidine and some polymeric forms. Biguanides are
widely used as aqueous solutions for hand washing and
preoperative  skin  preparation.  Because  biguanides are
cationic, their activity is greatly reduced by soaps and
other anionic compounds. The most important member of
this group, chlorhexidine, is available as dihydrochloride.
diacetate and gluconate. Chlorhexidine gluconate, which is
water soluble, is the form most commonly used. Absence
of toxicity 1s an 1mportant feature of biguanides
Chlorhexidine is a membrane-active agent which at low
concentrations inhibits membrane enzymes and
promotes leakage of cellular constituents. When the
concentration is increased, cytoplasmic constituents are
coagulated and a bactericidal effect is observed. This
biguanide  has a wide antibacterial  spectrum  which
includes Gram-positive bacteria and many Gram-negative
bacteria. It has limited fungicidalactivity.Some
Gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus species and
Pseudomonas species may be highly resistant to this
nor sporicidal. Although it may be active against some
enveloped viruses, the antiviral activity of chlorhexidine is
variable and it cannot be recommended as an effective
antiviral disinfectant. Chlorhexidine - alcohol solutions are
particularly effective as topical disinfectants; they combine
the antibacterial rapidity of alcohol with the persistence of
chlorhexidine at the site of application. Because it has
longer residual activity on teat skin than many other
disinfectants, chlorhexidine is used extensively in teat dips
for mastitis control programmes in dairy cattle. The
activity of chlorhexidine is pH dependent and it is more
2307
active at alkaline than acid pH values. Its activity is
reduced by the presence of organic matter. As some
biguanides may be toxic for aquatic species, care should be
taken when disposing of chlorhexidine solutions
Ethylene oxide
At room temperature, ethylene oxide is a colourless gas
with a faint odour and an irritating effect on eyes and
mucous membranes. It is soluble in water and a range of
organic solvents. Ethylene oxide is inflammable and when
present in the air at a concentration exceeding 3% it forms
an explosive mixture. This safety problem can be
overcome by mixing ethylene oxide with carbon dioxide or
other suitable gases which are not inflammable. Ethylene
oxide is not corrosive for metals and it decomposes
spontaneously into methane, ethane and carbon dioxide.
As an alkylating agent, ethylene oxide reacts with amino,
carboxyl, sulphydryl and hydroxyl groups, leading to
 s   g o o
also nucleic acids. It is a highly effective antimicrobial
agent with bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal and sporicidal
activity. Some vegetative bacteria such as enterococci are
does not inactivate prions. Activity against the protozoan
parasite  Cryptosporidium parvum has been reported.
Ethylene oxide is used for the low-temperature sterilization
of heat-sensitive equipment. A desirable feature of the gas
is its ability to penetrate a variety of materials including
large packages, bundles of cloth and certain plastics.
However, inactivation of microorganisms takes place
slowly. The antimicrobial activity of ethylene oxide is
2308
influenced　by　relative　humidity，
temperature.
concentration of the gas, contact time and the presence of
ethylene oxide include organic residues and salt crystals.
There has been a decline in the use of ethylene oxide in
recent years arising from risks to human health following
exposure to the gas through work-related activities and
also to patients arising from residual gas present in
sterilized material. Ethylene oxide has been listed as a
mutagen and a human carcinogen since the 1990s. Modern
ethylene oxide sterilization equipment and improved work
practices have decreased the risks associated with the use
of this low-temperature chemical sterilizing agent. Despite
broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent has persisted not only
because of its toxicity but also on account of its
inflammability. An additional concern relates to the
potential risks arising from release of this alkylating agent
into the environment in the immediate vicinity of
institutions employing ethylene oxide  routinely  for
low-temperature sterilization of equipment.
Halogens
Chlorine and iodine compounds are used extensively in
veterinary medicine for their antimicrobial activity. It is
claimed that bromine compounds, which are sometimes
used for their bactericidal  activity, have greater
antimicrobial activity than  chlorine compounds.  Despite
these claims, bromine compounds  are employed
infrequently as disinfectants.   In addition  to  their
long-established place in water treatment, chlorine gas and
2309
chlorine-releasing compounds are used extensively in food
processing industries. Iodine compounds are also used as
disinfectants in food processing and as teat dips in dairy
cattle. Because they are relatively non-toxic, iodine
compounds are used for hand disinfection preoperatively
1n
veterinary  and  human  healthcare  facilities, in
laboratories and also at farm level.
Chlorine compounds
Many different types of chlorine-releasing compounds are
available  for general-purpose disinfection for particular
applications  in food
1  processing  industriesand  for
veterinary use. The antimicrobial  activity of chlorine
preparations is determined by the amount of available
chlorine in solution is strongly influenced by chlorine
concentration, pH, the presence of organic matter and
exposure to light. Chlorine-releasing compounds include
sodium hypochlorite and N-chloro compounds, also
referred to as organic chlorine compounds.
Chloramine-T,
dichloramine-T,
halozone,
sodium
dichloro-isocyanurate and potassium dichloro-isocyanurate
are examplesof
organic
chlorine compounds.The
antimicrobial activity of these compounds is reported to be
slower than that of hypochlorites but some of these organic
chlorine compounds are less susceptible to inactivation by
organic matter than  sodium hypochlorite. Chlorine
dioxide, which is a gas at room temperature, has been
proposed as an alternative to sodium hypochlorite. This
gas, which is soluble in water, forming a stable solution in
the dark, decomposes slowly when exposed to light. At
concentrations above 1o% in air, chlorine dioxide is
2310
unstable and explosive. However, it is an effective
antimicrobial   compound   and   non-inflammable   and
non-explosive  at concentrations  used  for  sterilization.
Chlorine dioxide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum. It is
bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal
1(Table94.5)and
spori-cidal (Table 94.4) and reported to be capable of
inactivating prions (Table 94.7). A gaseous chlorine
dioxide sterilization apparatus, which was developed more
than 20 years ago, is available commercially. The
sterilizing ability of chlorine dioxide is reported to be
equivalent to that of ethylene oxide.
The antimicrobial activity of chlorine and its compounds is
      
when free chlorine is added to water. Hypochlorites and
chloramines undergo hydrolysis when added to water,
leading to the formation of hypochlorous acid. This acid
releases nascent oxygen, a powerful oxidizing agent.
Chlorine combines directly with bacterial cytoplasmic
proteins and with
viral
capsid
proteins. Although
chlorine-releasing compounds damage the genomes of a
number of viruses, the nature of these reactions is not
clearly defined. Chlorine compounds such as sodium
hypochlorite are most effective at pH values below 7 and
their antimicrobial activity is inversely proportional to the
pH of the environment in which they are used. The
optimum pH for hypochlorites is close to pH 5. Because of
their instability, hypochlorites can lose up to 50% of their
concentration within a month if stored in open containers.
On account of this instability, fresh solutions should be
prepared before use.
2311
Chlorine-releasing   compounds    are  potent    virucides.
Chlorination, a standard water treatment for preventing the
spread of infectious disease, is generally considered to be a
safe procedure. Chlorine gas has been used for decades for
the treatment of public water supplies and sodium
hypochlorite is employed for the treatment of water in
swimming pools. Household bleaches, which usually
contain high concentration of sodium hypochlorite, are
used at suitable dilutions in dairies, in food processing
plants and for general disinfection of equipment and farm
buildings. Sodium hypochlorite is fast-acting, non-staining
and inexpensive. However, its corrosive effects and its

circumstances. The two most important factors limiting the
antimicrobial activity of hypochlorites are the presence of
residual  organic  matter  and the neutralization  of
hypochlorous acid by alkaline substances. In environments
with high residual organic matter due to inadequate
cleaning, low levels of chlorine compounds are ineffective.
Health risks arising from the use of chlorine compounds
appear to be limited. Detection of trihalom-ethanes in
chlorinated water has raised concern about the safety of
this form of treatment of public water supplies as

rendering  public   water  supplies   safe   for  human
consumption are available at present. Advantages of

spectrum, ease of use and relatively low cost.
Iodine compounds
2312
The antimicrobial activity of iodine compounds has been
recognized for more than 180 years. Although iodine and
chlorine compounds share some common characteristics as
effective antimicrobial agents, they have a number of
distinguishing features. Iodine is less reactive chemically
than chlorine, and iodine compounds are more active in the
presence of organic matter than chlorine compounds. The
antimicrobial activity of iodine is greater at acid pH than at
alkaline pH.
Elemental iodine, a bluish-black crystalline substance with
a metallic lustre, is only slightly soluble in water. Despite
its low solubility, iodine was formerly used for its
antimicrobial activity as an aqueous solution.  Iodine is
readily soluble in ethyl alcohol and in aqueous solutions of
potassium iodide and sodium iodide. When dissolved in
ethyl alcohol (tincture of iodine), high levels of free iodine
are obtained. Disadvantages of using iodine solutions
include instability, staining of skin and fabrics, toxicity
and skin irritation. Inorganic iodine has been largely
replaced by iodophors in which iodine is complexed with
surface-active compounds or polymers which allow both
increased solubility and sustained release of free iodine. In
most iodophor preparations, the carrier is usually a
non-ionic surfactant in which iodine is present as micellar
aggregates. When complexed, free iodine levels are limited
and the disadvantages of using aqueous or alcoholic
solutions are avoided. An iodophor in which iodine is
complexed with polyvinylpyrrolidone,
referred to as povidone - iodine, is a commonly used
disinfectant. When an iodophor is diluted with water,
dispersion of the micellar aggregates of iodine occurs
leading to a slow release of iodine. Because the amount of
2313
concentration used, more concentrated solutions may have
less antimicrobial activity than diluted solutions. The
increased antimicrobial activity of dilute solutions reflects
the level of free iodine present. For maximum
antimicrobial effect, iodophor solutions should be diluted
in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions
When used at appropriate dilutions and at pH values below
5, iodophors have a broad range of antimicrobial activity.
They are bactericidal, fungicidal and virucidal. It has been
suggested that the amino acids tyrosine and histidine in the
viral capsid are the specific targets for iodine. These
disinfectants are reported to react with sulphydryl groups.
      
enveloped viruses to iodophors. Buffered solutions of
 r sr  ss  e  
high concentrations and long contact times are required for
effective sporicidal action. The spore coat and cortex are
the sites affected.  Reports of prolonged survival of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia in
povidone - iodine solution have been attributed to the
presence of organic matter, inorganic material or biofilm
formation on the items being treated. Addition of alcohol
improves    the    antimicrobial  activity   of    iodophors
Alcoholic solutions of iodophors are widely used in some
countries for disinfection of hands and sites prior to
surgical procedures. Acidic iodophor solutions are used as
disinfectants in dairy plants, the pH of iodophors is kept
acidic by the addition of phosphoric acid to ensure the
removal of dried milk residues. Effective post-milking teat
dipping is an important control measure for contagious
2314
mastitis in dairy cattle, and iodophors are among the
common teat dips used for this purpose.
Heavy metals and their derivatives
The term “heavy metals' includes metals such as mercury,
lead, zinc, silver and copper. Salts of heavy metals are
sometimes used for their antimicrobial activity in farming,
horticulture, and human and veterinary medicine. The
ability of extremely low concentrations of certain metals
such as silver and copper to exert a marked inhibitory
effect on bacteria, algae and fungi has been recognized for
centuries. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of
their ability to inhibit enzymatic activity in microbial
membranes and within the cytoplasm, by binding to
sulphydryl groups.
Copper, which is slowly oxidized in air, forms a series of
compounds, some with marked antimicrobial activity. For
decades, copper salts have been incorporated into lotions
for their antiseptic and astringent activities. In addition to
its inhibitory effect on microbial metabolism by combining
with sulphydryl groups, copper has a strong affinity for
DNA  which
itcan
denature   reversibly
atlow
concentrations. Copper salts, through their ability to
combine with protein molecules, are reported to have an
adverse effect on viral capsid proteins. Copper sulphate
mixed with lime, referred to as Bordeaux mixture, was
introduced in the 1880s as a spray for the control and
prevention of fungal infections in susceptible plants such
as potatoes. When sprayed on foliage, it adhered to leaves
forming a slow-release copper complex with sustained
2315
antifungal  activity.  The  algicidal  activity   of  copper

bodies of water and pools. A number of copper compounds
are used as preservatives in wood, paper and paint
industries
A number  of mercurial compounds including mercuric
chloride, mercurochrome, thiomersal and phenylmercuric
nitrate have been used for many years for the treatment of
minor wounds and skin infections. Thiomersal, which was
formerly used as a skin disinfectant and fungicide, is used
as a preservative for biological products such as bacterial
and viral vaccines. Concerns arising from the risks of
environmental pollution, direct toxicity and the persistence
of mercury in the environment have resulted in a
progressive decline in the use of mercurial compounds in
recent years. The majority of mercurial compounds have
been replaced by disinfectants and therapeutic agents
which are less toxic, more effective and less likely to result
in environmental pollution.  Inclusion of mercury  in
products for agricultural and industrial use is strongly
discouraged by regulatory authorities.
Interference with sulphydryl groups has been proposed as
the likely method of interference by silver compounds with
bacterial and fungal enzyme systems. Aqueous solutions of
silver nitrate, which are bactericidal, have been used to
prevent infection of burn wounds in human patients. The
antibacterial effect of silver-releasing surgical dressing has
been documented. Sand coated with silver has been used in
filters for water purification, and silver-coated charcoal has
been employed for similar purposes. The virucidal activity
of silver compounds against a range of enveloped and
2316
non-enveloped viruses has been described. Although the
mode of action has not been
explained, alteration of capsid proteins was proposed as
the likely method of inactivation.
β-Propiolactone
At room temperature β-propiolactone is a colourless
non-flammable liquid which is miscible with water. The
antimicrobial activity of β-propiolactone depends on its
concentration and on relative humidity and temperature. It
is bactericidal, fungicidal, sporicidal and virucidal.
Microbial inactivation is attributed to alkylation of DNA
It is a highly effective gaseous sterilizing agent. Although
β-propiolactone is considerably more active than ethylene
oxide, it lacks the penetrating power of ethylene oxide.
When organic matter is present, an increased concentration
of β-propiolactone is required.
β-Propiolactone has been widely used for the production of
inactivated veterinary viral vaccines. It has potential use in
decontamination of animal premises and when dealing
with contaminated fluids of animal origin. Health hazards
associated with the use of β-propiolactone include skin
lesions and eye irritation following direct exposure. Of
even greater concern are the longer term risks following
limited exposure because of the suspected carcinogenic
activity of this potent antimicrobial agent.
Peroxygen compounds
Hydrogen peroxide,  peracetic  acid,  ozone  and
peroxygen-based
1  commercial  disinfectants  containing
2317
sodium or potassium peroxymonosulphates are strong
oxidizing agents with broad antimicrobial  spectra. A
peroxygen compounds, including peroxymono-sulphates,
are
ineffective   as   mycobactericidal
agents. The
characteristics of individual compounds determine their
usefulness as disinfectants in veterinary medicine
Hydrogen peroxide, which is available as a solution, is a
non-polluting compound that decomposes to oxygen and
water. The strength of a solution of hydrogen peroxide is
usually specified as 10 volumes or 20 volumes, which
indicates the volume of oxygen that evolves from 1
volume of the peroxide solution. For industrial use, higher
concentrations of solution are available. Because hydrogen
peroxide solutions are unstable, benzoic acid or other
suitable substances are added as stabilizers. This oxidizing
agent is bactericidal and sporicidal. There are limited data
on the virucidal activity of hydrogen peroxide, and some
non-enveloped viruses may survive exposure to its
oxidizing activity. Hydrogen peroxide is an effective
sporicidal agent and its activity is enhanced by increased
concentrations and elevated temperatures. In common with
some
：other
peroxygen compounds, the activity of
hydrogen peroxide against mycobacteria is questionable.
The presence of catalase or other peroxidases in some
bacteria can increase tolerance to low levels of hydrogen
peroxide. Due to the activity of tissue catalase, strong
effervescence follows application of hydrogen peroxide to
contaminated wounds and this reaction assists in the
removal of cellular debris and pus. When applied to
tissues, the antimicrobial activity is of short duration.
Formation of hydroxyl radicals, which react with cellular
2318
components including nucleic acid, account for the
antimicrobial activity of this compound. A new process,
using radio waves to generate plasma-activated hydrogen
peroxide vapour, has been developed in recent years. The
generation of hydroxyl ions and other free radicals. In
addition  to its use as a disinfectant and antiseptic.
hydrogen peroxide is used in the food industry for aseptic
packaging
Peracetic acid, a colourless liquid with a pungent odour, is
a strong oxidizing agent. It is miscible with water and has
greater lipid solubility and more potent antimicrobial
activity than hydrogen peroxide. This disinfectant, which
is available commercially as a 15% aqueous solution, is
rapidly lethal for a wide range of microorganisms
including bacteria and their spores, fungi, algae and
viruses. Even at low temperatures, and in the presence of
organic matter, it is sporicidal. Unlike a number of other
peroxygen compounds, per-acetic acid is mycobactericidal.
It oxidizes sulphydryl and amino groups and denatures
protein and nucleic acid. Because of its wide antimicrobial
spectrum, it is used as a cold sterilizing agent for some
thermolabile medical devices. Peracetic acid can corrode
steel, copper and other metals and it can damage natural
and
d synthetic rubber. On account of its strong
antimicrobial action at low temperatures and an absence of
residues,  peracetic  acid
iswidelyusedinthe
food-processing and beverage industries. It is also used for
disinfecting sewage sludge. At concentrations close to
60%, peracetic acid can be explosive at room temperature.

2319
irritation caused to mucous membranes, concern has been
expressed about safety aspects of peracetic acid. Following
prolonged exposure to moderate levels of peracetic acid.
there may be an increased risk of tumour development.
Ozone, an allotropic form of oxygen, has strong oxidizing
properties. It is bactericidal, sporicidal and virucidal. In
water, ozone is chemically unstable but its antimicrobial
activity persists due to the production of free radicals,
including hydroxyl radicals.
Alteration of proteins following treatment with ozone
results from reactions with cysteine, tryptophane and
methionine. The primary viral changes caused by ozone
appear to result from structural damage to viral capsids,
followed by inactivation of viral nucleic acid. The
sporicidal activity of ozone is attributed to changes
induced in the outer spore coat layers. Ozone is sometimes
used for disinfection of water and also in the food industry.
A number of commercial disinfectants utilize peroxygen
compounds in their formulations. One such commercial
preparation, Virkon?, has been evaluated for its activity
against mycobacteria. Based on the results obtained, it was
concluded that Virkon  @ was ineffective as a
mycobactericidal agent (Griffiths et al., 1999).
With the exception of peracetic acid, there is uncertainty
about the mycobactericidal activity of a number of
peroxygen compounds. Several newlow-temperature
procedures for sterilization, utilizing hydrogen peroxide
gas plasma and ion plasmas formed from peracetic acid,
have been described in recent years. These new procedures
offer many potential advantages over some of the methods
currently available for sterilization
2320
Phenolic compounds
For more than 150 years, phenol has been employed for its
antimicrobial activity. It has the distinction of being one of
the first chemicals used as an antiseptic in surgical
procedures. Phenol was also the standard disinfectant with
which other chemicals with potential antimicrobial use
were compared
inaprocedure knownasthe
phenol-coefficient technique. Formerly, most of the
phenolic  compounds used for the manufacture of
disinfectants were obtained from tar, hence the use of the
term coal-tar disinfectants. Tar itself, a by-product of the
destructive distillation of coal, contains a number of
products. Fractionation of tar yields phenols, organic bases
and neutral products. The temperature employed for
fractionation determines the range of products produced
and their biological activity. A progressive increase in
desirable  biological  properties
s  of coal-tar phenols  is
observed with increasing
boiling point but this is
accompanied by decreased solubility in water. Formerly,
some well known patented coal-tar products such as Jeyes
Fluid and Lysol, solubilized by the addition of soap, were
popular general-purpose
disinfectants. Today, many
phenolic compounds are synthesized. In addition to a wide
range of coal-tar phenols, non-coal-tar phenols such as
2-phenylphenol (ortho-phenylphenol) are also available.
Simple and substituted phenols constitute a vast group of
chemicals but their antimicrobial activity cannot be readily
nitration increases the antibacterial activity of phenol but
nitration also increases systemic toxicity. In the bisphenol
series, halogenation confers additional antimicrobial
activity.  Phenolic compounds range from phenol and
2321
cresylic acid to a collection of high-boiling tar acids. The
term black fluids is applied to coal-tar fractions solubilized
with soaps: white fluids are emulsions prepared from tar
fractions.Because  of differences
informulation,
generalizations  concerning  the  antimicrobial  activity  of
phenolic compounds are inappropriate. The antimicrobial
activity and also the toxicity of individual phenolic
disinfectants depend on the exact formulation and
concentration of each active constituent in the preparation.
By binding to amino acid residues and displacing water
molecules, phenols denature protein. Conformational
changes in membrane proteins result in cytoplasmic
membrane damage leading to leakage of intracellular
components. Some phenolic compounds also react with
thiol groups, causing metabolic inhibition.
When employed at recommended concentrations, phenolic
compounds  are  bactericidal.  Ortho-phenylphenol  and
black fluids are particularly effective against mycobacteria
but
bisphenols
are
not
tmycobactericidal.
When
halogenated, phenols and cresols have antifungal activity
As a group, phenolic compounds are not sporicidal and
their activity against viruses is formulation-dependent;
enveloped viruses may be inactivated but non - enveloped
viruses are often resistant. Ortho-phenylphenol is active
against enveloped and many non-enveloped viruses. Due
to the great diversity of phenolic compounds available and
the wide variation in their formulations, this group of
disinfectants cannot be recommended as reliable virucidal
agents. Phenolic compounds are usually moderately priced
and not seriously affected by the presence of organic
matter. Contact with the skin should be avoided because of
the irritation and depigmentation produced by some
2322
compounds. As pigs and cats are particularly susceptible to
the toxic effects of phenolic disinfectants, all treated
surfaces should
1bethoroughly
rinsedbefore the
reintroduction of animals. Phenolic compounds impart a
tarry odour and leave a residual film on surfaces which can
cause tainting of food and
[  agricultural   products
Accordingly, these disinfectants should not be used in
meat plants, dairies or food storage areas. They are

come into direct contact with food for human
consumption.
Disinfectants  containing
phenolic
compounds are potentially toxic for workers, domestic
animals and wildlife. In circumstances where substantial
amounts of these disinfectants are used in farm buildings,
run-off should not be discharged into ponds, lakes, rivers
or streams. Fluid containing phenolic disinfectants
should be collected in slurry tanks or other suitable holding
facilities and applied to arable land remote from water
courses.
Quaternary ammonium compounds
The structure of quaternary ammonium compounds is
related to that of ammonium chloride and these chemicals
can be considered as organically substituted ammonium
compounds.
These
cationic
compounds 
have
surface-active properties but they are incompatible with a
wide range of chemical agents including non-ionic and
anionic surfactants such as soaps, phos-pholipids and other
substances. Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs)
are most effective at neutral or slightly alkaline pH values
They have low toxicity and high solubility in water. These
disinfectants exert their antimicrobial action by reacting
2323
with anionic lipids in the cytoplasmic membrane and with
the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Low
concentrations of QACs cause membrane damage with
resultant leakage
of
cvtoplasmic
components,  a
consequence of the disruption of the interactions between
lipids and proteins  in
 membrane  structures. High
concentrations of QACs nduce coagulation of cytoplasmic
components.Interactionsof
fthese compounds with
enzymes essential for cell metabolism interfere  with
metabolic processes. QACs are attracted to the negatively
charged surfaces of microorganisms where they bind to
phospholipids in the cell membrane and denature proteins,
thereby impairing permeability. They should be applied to
clean surfaces as their antimicrobial activity is reduced by
organic matter such as blood, milk or faeces.
In comparison with many other disinfectants, QACs are
moderately expensive. They have a limited antimicrobial
spectrumand
d   they  exhibit greater  activity  against
Gram-positive  bacteria
 than  against   Gram-negative
bacteria.   Some
 Gram-negative  
bacteria   such    as
Pseudomonas species and Serratia marcescens can survive
and grow in solutions of QACs. These cationic compounds
are neither mycobactericidal nor sporicidal.  Although
some of these compounds have activity against enveloped
viruses, non-enveloped viruses are resistant and as a group
they are considered unreliable virucides
One of the most commonly used QACs, benzalkonium
chloride,  which  is  bactericidal  and  fungicidal,  is
incompatible with components of some commercial rubber
preparations but not with silicone rubber. This compound
is employed for preoperative preparation of skin and
2324
mucous membranes. Benzethonium chloride is employed
for treatment of superficial wounds and also for controlling
algal growth in swimming pools. Ethyl alcohol potentiates
the action of QACs.
High concentrations of QACs can cause skin irritation.
Because they are non-staining, odourless, non-toxic and
usually non-corrosive, QACs are used extensively as
disinfectants in food processing industries. They are also
used for disinfection of automatic calf feeders and
included in sheep dips for  controlling microorganisms
associated with fleece problems.
Characteristics of chemicals employed as disinfectants, not
only in veterinary medicine and human medicine but also
for procedures related to public health and for use in the
food industry, are summarized in Table 94.8.
Microbial resistance to disinfection
Disinfectants play an important role in limiting the spread
of bacterial pathogens (Russell, 2003). The continuous use
of these agents in veterinary medicine and elsewhere could
potentially lead to the emergence of bacteria resistant to
these important antimicrobial compounds. Bacteria with
increased tolerance to disinfectants have been reported and
can be selected for under defined laboratory conditions
(McMurry et al., 1998; Braoudaki and Hilton, 2004 ;
Randall et al., 2004). When a disinfectant is used under
suboptimal conditions, treated bacteria may survive. This
may occur following dilution, through inactivation of the
disinfectant by organic material present in the environment
2325
being treated, or through incorrect application of the
disinfectant.
Resistance to disinfectants is less common among bacteria
than antibiotic resistance (Poole, 2002). Nonetheless.
resistance to different classes of disinfectants has been
reported for pathogens of veterinary importance including
E. coli, Campylobacter species, Listeria species,
staphylococci and Pseudomonas species (Randall et al.,
2001, 2003 ; Brenwald and Fraise, 2003). When used in
accordance with the recommended guidelines, commercial
disinfectants are usually effective.
Several mechanisms of resistance to disinfectants have
been described and many of these overlap with the
concern that bacteria resistant to various classes of
disinfectants may develop cross-resistance to important
antibiotics used to treat animals.
Resistance  to  disinfectants
 following
targetsite
modifications
In the laboratory, it is possible to select bacteria which
have acquired resistance to disinfectants. Mutants of E.
coli, Salmonella Typhimurium
1andS.aureus
demonstrating reduced susceptibility to triclosan can be
selected in vitro. Triclosan is a widely used biocide and, at
low concentrations, it is the only biocide kmown to inhibit
a specific bacterial enzyme, FabI, that encodes an enol
acyl-carrier protein (ACP) reductase involved in fatty acid
biosynthesis. Levels of resistance conferred by fabl
mutants with MIC ranges of between 1 and 64 mg/ml are
2326
significantly below concentrations of the disinfectant
applied in practice (from 2,000 to 20,000 mg/ml)
Interestingly, Braoudaki and Hilton (2004) described an E.
coli Ol57 strain that exhibited an MIC to triclosan of more
than 1,024 mg/ml. This strain did not contain any
alteration in the fabl-encoding gene, suggesting that an
undescribed mechanism may be involved. In Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, a second enol-ACP reductase, denoted as
FabV, was recently described (Zhu et al., 2010)

Because
the

gene
 present  in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and M. smegmatis is a common target for both
triclosan and isoniazid, an antimicrobial therapeutic-agent
cross-resistance between these two unrelated compounds
may arise (McMurry et al., 1999).
Resistance to disinfectants arising from alterations in cell

common
among
Gram-negative bacteria, such as the Enterobacteriaceae
and among Pseudomonas species. This is often attributed
to mechanisms that limit the intracellular concentration of
2330
a disinfectant. Structural components of the outer cell
membranes of these bacteria present an effective barrier to
the entry of some disinfectants (Table 94.9)
In Gram-positive bacteria, the mechanically strong, thick.

antimicrobial
compounds，into

(Tkachenko et al., 2007).
In contrast to Gram-positive bacteria, the envelope of
Gram-negative bacteria is composed of a multi-layered
structure  that
 exhibits
an
 increased   resistance
to
disinfectants  (Stickler,  2004). The  cell
1wall
of
Gram-negative bacteria has an outer membrane (OM), in
which structural components function to limit the entry of
disinfectants into the cytoplasm.
Water-filled outer-membrane protein channels known as
porins facilitate the selective entry of small molecules into
the cell and simultaneously

hydrophobic and large hydrophilic disinfectant molecules
(Poole, 2002). In E. coli, the outer membrane protein F

The role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a permeability
barrier   in 
Gram-negative
bacteria has
been reported
extensively. LPS
S is a unique component of the OM in
Gram-negative bacteria and forms a rigid barrier that limits
penetration of lipophilic compounds into the cell (Stickler.
2004).
Other
membrane
proteins
and
membrane
characteristics, such as surface hydrophobicity, have also
been shown to influence the entry of disinfectants into the
cell.
2332
The electrostatic charge associated with bacterial cell
surfaces also plays a role in resistance to disinfectants,
especially in the case of compounds such as QACs
(Bruinsma et al., 2006).
Gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria display  an
intrinsic resistance to disinfectants (Gilbert et al., 2004)
Spores are resistant to most disinfectants, such as alcohols,
biguanides,  organic
acids, phenolic  compounds,
organomercurials and QACs, that would inactivate
vegetative cells. The endospore structure provides a robust
physical barrier, rendering many disinfectants ineffective
as sporicidal agents.
Resistance to disinfectants mediated by efflux pumps
Efflux  pumps  are membrane-associated proteins  that
extrude a range of structurally dissimilar toxic compounds
from the cytoplasm of the cell. Five classes of efflux
pumps are recognized and are widely distributed among
bacteria. These include the small multidrug resistance
(SMR) family (now part of the drug/ metabolite transporter
(DMT) superfamily), the major facilitator superfamily
(MFS), the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, the
  a ( os - o - s
multidrug and toxic drug extrusion (MATE) superfamily.
Additional information on efflux pump structures is
provided in Chapter 12.
In Gram-positive bacteria, genes encoding SMR and MFS
families of efflux pumps are frequently located on
plasmids. Reduced susceptibility of S. aureus to QACs,
phenolic compounds and intercalating agents was linked
2333
with the efflux pumps QacA to D (Wang et al., 2008). In
Acinetobacter species, E. coli, Salmonella species,
Pseudomonas species and other Gram-negative bacteria,
transporters such as QacE and QacE ?l are also located on
latter are generally associated with integrons that may
account  for  their broad  dissemination. Salmonella
Typhimurium DT104 contains a 43-kbp Salmonella
Genomic Island 1 (SGI 1) (described in Chapter 12)
wherein a qacEl-encoding gene linked to a class 1
integron is located on the chromosome. This structure or
its derivatives have been identified in more than 15
different Salmonella serovars and also in Proteus
mirabilis.
The following Gram-negative bacteria possess  well
characterized membrane transport proteins: Pseudomonas
αeruginosa, MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN
and MexJK (Poole, 2007); E. coli and Salmonella.
AcrAB-TolC, AcrEF-TolC and EmrE; and Campylobacter
jejuni and C. coli, CmeABC (Piddock, 2006). Despite their
ability to export a range of structurally diverse chemical
compounds, chromosomally-encoded efflux pumps are not
known to promote acquired resistance to biocides (Poole,
2004). Over-expression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in
E. coli confers resistance to triclosan and pine oils (Moken
et al., 1997).
Bacteria resistant to various classes of disinfectants can
exhibit cross-resistance to some important antibiotics used
to treat animals. The relationship between biocide export
and antibiotic resistance remains to be determined (Poole,
2004).
2334
Mercury  resistance has been attributed  to  the
plasmid-encoded mer genes (Poole, 2004). Chlorhexidine
resistance due to degradation of the biocide has also been
reported (Ogase et al., 1992), as has resistance to
formaldehyde due to the plasmid-encoded formaldehyde
dehydrogenase found in E. coli (Kummerle et al., 1996)
and Seratia marcescens (Kaulfers and Marquardt, 1991).
Resistance   to    disinfectants    mediated    by    bacterial
populations within biofilms
Many bacteria are associated with surfaces and grow as a
biofilm rather than as planktonic cells. Population-based
resistance to disinfectants may play an important role in
vivo. Populations of bacteria in biofilms have been
consistently described as displaying biocide resistance
orders of magnitude higher than their planktonic
counterparts (Smith and Hunter, 2008). This has major
implications for the control of infectious agents of
importance in veterinary medicine, where biofilms may
form on surgical equipment, implants and elsewhere.
Bacteriawithin
a
biofilm are organized intoa
three-dimensional structure consisting of multiple bacterial
species embedded within an exopolysaccharide matrix or
glycocalyx. Biofilms containing Salmonella and Proteus
exhibit an increased resistance to triclosan. Listeria species
present in a biofilm show increased resistance to
peroxides. Within these bacterial communities, metabolism
is altered
and the organisms exhibit a biofilm-associated pheno-type,
including a reduction in disinfectant penetration due to the
extracellular polysaccharide matrix (Pan et al., 2006),
2335
enzymatic inactivation of the biocide (Huang et al., 1995)
and induction of efflux pumps (Maira-Litran et al., 2000).
Increased resistance to biocides within a biofilm has been
attributed to several factors. The extracellular matrix acts
as a physical barrier, limiting diffusion of the disinfectant
into the bacterial cell. This barrier also facilitates the
inactivation of the biocide through chemical reactions that
       
The glycocalyx contains trapped extracellular enzymes
which are concentrated within this matrix (Gilbert et al.,
2004). If a species capable of producing an inactivating
enzyme to a particular disinfectant is present within a
biofilm, it will confer resistance upon that entire bacterial
community
Bacteria present in biofilms have a slower growth rate than
planktonic cells due to the limited nutrients in this
environment.  Therefore,  bacterial  cells  in  such  a
dormant cells. Slowly growing cells are generally more
resistant to biocidal compounds than rapidly growing cells
(Stickler, 2004).  Similarly,  the  biofilm-associated
phenotype involves an alteration in OM proteins that
reduces the permeability of the cell and up-regulates efflux
pump activity.
Disinfection procedures
The correct choice of disinfectant is fundamental to the
success of a disinfection programme. For optimal activity,
disinfectants should be used at the correct concentration
and allowed sufficient contact time with the surfaces or
2336
equipment. Thorough cleaning of all surfaces before
application of disinfectant is essential for the inactivation
of infectious agents as the antimicrobial activity of many
chemical compounds is seriously impaired by residual
organic matter such as faeces, blood, exudates, food and
bedding. Moderate amounts of organic matter interfere
with the activity of halogen disinfectants, particularly
sodium hypochlorite, whereas phenolic disinfectants retain
much of their activity under similar conditions
A pressure washer set at low pressure can be used for
applying disinfectant to the surfaces of buildings at a rate
of 0.4 litres/m'. A knapsack sprayer may suffice for small
areas. Fumigation may be the preferred method for
disinfection of buildings if an outbreak of a notifiable
disease has been confirmed. As many disinfectants such as
formaldehyde are
ineffective at low temperatures,
buildings should be heated to approximately 20?C in cold
weather. Transport vehicles  should be included  in
disinfection programmes as pathogens can be transferred
over long distances in the cargo area, in the cab or,
occasionally, on the outside of the vehicle. High-pressure
cleaning with warm water containing detergent should be
followed by rinsing with hot water. Surfaces should be
allowed to dry before the application of disinfectant at the
correct concentration to all parts of the vehicle, including
the bodywork and wheels. A contact time of at least 30
minutes is required. Waste water from vehicles should be
disposed of in a slurry tank and applied only to land used
fortillage
Attention to detailis essential for the success of a
disinfection programme. Failure to inactivate infectious
2337
agents present in buildings, on equipment or in transport
vehicles may be due to the selection of an ineffective
disinfectant, careless use of a potentially effective
disinfectant, environmental factors or reintroduction of
infectious agents by clinically affected animals, healthy
carrier animals, food or rodents (Table 94.10)
Footbaths
Many infectious agents shed in faeces or urine of animals
     
another. Footbaths located at entry points to a farm or
building should be used by all staff and visitors. To ensure
compliance with footbath use, all pedestrians entering the
premises should wear clean, waterproof footwear.
Footbaths should be large enough to accommodate the
largest size of footwear worn by workers or visitors.
Disinfectants suitable for footbath use include iodophors,
phenolic compounds and formalin. If a specific infectious
agent is identified as the cause of a disease outbreak, a
disinfectant known to be effective against that agent
should be used in all footbaths on the premises.
Wheel baths
Wheel baths are sometimes positioned at farm entrances as
part of a disease control programme (Quinn and Markey,
2001). The design of wheel baths should be such that there
is adequate contact with disinfectant for a sufficient time to
S a  s sn  s s
The tyre of the largest wheel entering the bath should be
completely immersed in disinfectant in one revolution.
2338
Installation of a properly designed wheel bath is expensive
and may impart an unrealistic impression of biosecurity. In
many instances, the contents of vehicles, including
animals, their secretions and excretions, animal feed and
bedding, pose a greater threat of transferring infectious
agents than vehicle wheels.

disinfection programmes or limit their effectiveness.

Practical aspects of disinfection procedures
To ensure success, disinfection procedures require careful
planning and efficient implementation. Many chemicals
used as disinfectants are corrosive, toxic or hazardous
Highly reactive chemicals such as formaldehyde and
glutaraldehyde may be carcinogenic. Those supervising
disinfection programmes should ensure that prolonged
contact with  toxic chemicals by
yworkersisavoided
Disinfectants should be kept in cool, dark storage areas
and used before they reach the expiry date specified on
containers. They should be diluted by trained personnel in
accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. All staff
working with strong solutions of acids or alkalis should
wear face shields and rubber gloves. Chlorine-releasing
compounds and formaldehyde should never be used
together or immediately after each other because a potent
interact. Fumigation procedures require careful planning
and should not be carried out by inexperienced staff.
Care
eis required when cleaning buildings before
disinfection proceeds. Power hosing can generate aerosols
containing viable pathogens which may be inhaled by
workers unless properly fitting face masks are worn. After
an outbreak of anthrax, the building should be sealed and
2340
all drains blocked. The contents of the building including
bedding, fittings and equipment should be sprayed with
5% formalin which should be left to act for at least 10
hours before items are removed. Subsequently, the entire
building and its fittings should be cleaned and disinfected.
As no single chemical disinfectant can be considered
suitable for every purpose and circumstance, the selection
and use of disinfectants for particular microbial pathogens
require a clear understanding of their antimicrobial
spectrum and their limitations. Some disinfectants such as
aldehydes have a wide antimicrobial spectrum while other
compounds such as
 biguanides are limited in their
antimicrobial
 activity.
Cost,
availability, stability,
inactivation by organic matter and toxicity are features that
influence the selection, safety and general use of many
chemical compounds on the farm, in food processing
industries or for
specific
aspectsofdiseasecontrol
programmes. Chemical disinfectants are indispensable for
the successful implementation of disease eradication
programmes. To ensure success, the use, application and
limitations of these compounds should be understood by
those implementing
such
programmes.Withcareful
selection, accurate
dilution and
ljudicious use of
disinfectants,  tissue
residues,  food
 tainting   and
environmental pollution can be readily avoided while still
ensuring the destruction of microbial pathogens of
veterinary 1mportance.
In addition to the intrinsic resistance of bacterial
endospores,  mycobacteria  and
some Gram-negative
bacteria to particular chemical compounds, the ability of a
number of pathogenic bacteria to acquire resistance to
chemical disinfectants has been observed in recent years.
2341
There is evidence that resistance to disinfectants and
antibiotics is genetically linked in a number of instances.
Although not an issue of major concern at present, this
development   confirms  the  adaptability  of   bacterial
pathogens to measures aimed at controlling environmental
microbial populations through chemical intervention. This
observation also
emphasizes the need for careful selection and prudent use
of chemical compounds as part of disease control
programmes for animal and human populations. Education
of farmers, producers, food processors and others engaged
in the development and implementation of biosecurity
programmes requires a coordinated effort on the part of
veterinary, medical and health science professionals so that
each can offer informed advice on the careful selection,
proper use and safe disposal of chemical compounds with
antimicrobial activity.
