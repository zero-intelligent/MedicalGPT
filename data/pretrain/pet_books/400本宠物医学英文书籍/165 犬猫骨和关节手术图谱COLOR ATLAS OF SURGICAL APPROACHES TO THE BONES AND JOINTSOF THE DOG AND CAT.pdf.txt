Preface
Many surgeons usually choose to review regional anatomy when planning for surgery. Anatomical review is more likely
while learning new surgical tcchniques, as identification of anatomical structures is not as routine. This atlas provides an
answer to traumatologists who have been asking for a collction of colour anatomical images of the most common surgical
approaches to the limbs. The selected images have been used in continuing education courses for traumatologists with great
success and availability in text book format is often asked.
The approaches to the thoracic limt are prescnted in three sections. The first includes the scapula, shoulder and hume-
rus of the dog, the second contains the elbow, radius, ulna and manus of the dog, and a third section includes selections on
the cat. The pelvic limb begins with the hip joint and thigh and continues with the knce, leg and pes of thc dog. It conclu-
des with the corresponding approaches in the cat. Images of the articulated boncs of the region are presented at the begin-
ning of each section. All approaches were completed on fresh tissue (no fixation) for more natural colour. Cadaver vesscs
were highlighted by colour injection. Superficial to decp views of prepararions are presented with thc relevant musclcs, liga-
ments, nerves and vessels identified, Additionally, several vidcos of the thoracic and pelvic limbs with 3l) rcconstruction,

proxinal to distal. Footnotes indicate the commonly uscd protocol for each surgical approach.
