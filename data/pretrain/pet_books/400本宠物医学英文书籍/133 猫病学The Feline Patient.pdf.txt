CHAPTER 2
Acne
Christine A. Rees
Overview
Acne is a common dermatologic condition in cats. Feline acne is a follicu-
lar keratinization and glandular proliferation of tissue and glands of the
chin area. Other areas that can also be affected include the lower and
upper lips. The usual age of onset is 6 months to 14 years of age (median
age 4 years old). One study evaluating 22 cats with acne found that a
variety of skin lesions are present with feline acne. The most common
skin lesions noted with acne are comedones (73%), alopecia (68%), crusts
'ssA eapa saseo aaaas un (%lt) euauia pue (%t) anded (%)
and scars can be present. The most common body location is the chin.
Pruritus is infrequent (35% of 22 cats). Malassezia pachydermatitis is

patients (45%). The bacteria that are isolated include coagulase-positive 
ings in cats with acne include lymphoplasmacytic periductal inflamma-
tion, sebaceous gland duct dilatation, follicular keratosis with plugging
 and dilatation, folliculitis, pyogranulomatous adenitis, and furunculosis.

● History and Clinical Signs: These are so distinct that they are usually

● Histopathology: Histologic signs for feline acne are classic (see

description).
Primary Therapeutics
● Secondary infections should be treated with systemic antibiotics for
3 weeks or I week beyond when the skin appears normal.
· Topical medications are useful for treating feline acne. The chin should
be clipped and cleaned prior to applying these topical medications.
Examples of topical medications that have been used include salicylic
acid pads (i.e., Stridex pads), benzoyl peroxide 5% gel, 0.01 to 0.025%
ment, and mupiricin ointment.
Therapeutic Notes
· Hot packing of the chin prior to treatment often makes the treatment 
more effective. A warm, moist cloth can be held on the chin for 30
seconds to open the pores and allow the medication to penetrate
better.
 Prognosis
 The prognosis is good for feline acne. Intermitent lifelong symptomatic 
treatment is often necessary. Feline acne is primarily a cosmetic concern.
The exception is when a secondary infection is present. Bacterial skin
infections often require systemic therapy to achieve control.

CHAPTER 3
Acrome
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
Acromegaly is a well-recognized but rare disorder of cats caused by
a functional growth hormone (GH) secreting tumor of the anterior
pituitary. The disease is characterized by overgrowth of bone, viscera,
and soft tissue and insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. Most acromegalic
cats are middle-aged to older males; a breed predisposition has not
been recognized.
 Severe insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus is the most common and
important clinical manifestation. GH exerts significant diabetogenic
activity through its ability to create peripheral insulin resistance. Some
acromegalic cats require 30 to 130 units of insulin per day to control
concurrent diabetes. Historical and clinical findings include polyphagia,
polyuria, polydipsia, weight gain despite poorly controlled diabetes,
enlargement of the head, widened interdental spaces, inferior prog-
nathism, large paws, rapid growth of toenails, thickened skin, degen-
erative arthritis, thickening of pharyngeal tissues, and organomegaly

(especially cardiac, hepatic, and renal). Cats presented late in the course
of disease may show signs of heart disease or failure (ie., systolic

CHAPTER 7
Anal Sac Disease
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
The anal sacs are located lateral to the anus in the 4- to 5-o'clock and
external anal sphincters and contain sebaceous and apocrine tubular
anal glands, which secrete a malodorous substance that is used for scent
marking, individual recognition, and defense purposes. This substance
is temporarily stored in the paired anal sacs (paranal sinuses), which
empty voluntarily when the cat feels threatened or involuntarily with
bowel movements. If the sacs are not emptied periodically, the anal
gland secretion desiccates and thickens. See Figure 7-1. At this stage, the
anal sacs are said to be impacted; the cat exhibits pain when defecating
and may experience tenesmus. The cat responds by licking or biting at
the tailhead region. If infection occurs within the sacs, pain will increase.

rial through a draining tract over one or both anal sacs. See Figure 7-2.
Thus, the three stages of anal sac disease are impaction, infection, and
abscessation.
An unrelated anal sac condition is incompetence of the anal sac
sphincters. When affected, cats spontaneously release normal anal sac

Figure 7-1.
· Irrigation: An antiseptic solution, such as dilute chlorhexidine, is
used to flush remaining dried debris from the anal sacs. Sedation of 
 the cat generally is required.
· Antibiotic Instillation: Local treatment with antibiotics is indicated.
Drugs expected to be effective against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus
fecalis, and Clostridium spp. should be considered.
· Systemic Antibiotics: Systemic antibiotics with the characteristics

congenital defects such as mitral valve dysplasia.
 Left ventricular concentric hypertrophy occurs when significant
outflow obstruction is present. The elevated left ventricular pressures
may eventually result in left-sided congestive heart failure in severely
affected cats.
Physical examination reveals a left basilar systolic ejection-
type murmur and potentially late-rising femoral pulses, which are
difficult to note at high heart rates.

 Two distinct forms of aspergillosis have been described in cats: local-
ized sino-nasal/orbital disease and disseminated disease. Localized
disease is much less common than disseminated disease and involves
the nasal cavity and frontal sinus. Local extension into the orbit may
cause exophthalmos, although orbital disease has been described in
one cat with no evidence of sino-nasal or disseminated disease. Sino-
nasal infection is associated with extensive and irreversible turbinate
destruction. Clinical signs of nasal and sinus involvement include inspi-
 ratory dyspnea and stertor, sneezing, chronic mucopurulent nasal dis-
charge, epistaxis, facial swelling, and mandibular lymphadenopathy.
A mass lesion may be visualized within the nasal cavity. Localized
infection has also been described in the urinary bladder of a cat with
cystitis. Cats with disseminated disease have nonspecific signs of leth-
argy, fever, anorexia, and depression; vomiting and diarrhea have been 
reported in a few cats. Necropsy of cats with disseminated disease has
demonstrated fungal hyphae in the lungs, heart, bladder, kidney, liver,
and brain.

· Technique: An allergy test is performed, either by intradermal or
in vitro means. Specific allergens are selected to which the patient
appears to be to allergic. An allergen-based serum is formulated
and injected subcutaneously according to various protocols. If the 
patient responds, injections must be continued for life.
● Disadvantage: The primary drawback is the delayed therapeutic
response (1-3 months, range of 1-12 months). Symptomatic man-
agement may be needed during the first 3 months of the immu-
notherapy. Potential risks include worsening of symptoms, which
can be controlled by modification of injection protocol, and imme-
diate adverse reaction to the injection, manifested as diarrhea,
vomiting, weakness, or collapse. Severe reactions are rare when
the immunotherapy is administered properly.
Secondary Therapeutics
● Treat Secondary Causes of Pruritus: Secondary infections of the skin
or ears need to be treated. In addition, exposure to external parasites,
such as fleas, can cause an increase in pruritus. Therefore, cats should
be on flea control products during immunotherapy.

CHAPTER 18
Basal Cell Tumors
Bradley R. Schmidt and Mitchell A. Crystal
Overview
Basal cell tumors are common, making up 11 to 30% of feline skin tumors.
Basal cell tumors occur in older adult cats (mean age 10-ll years) and
may be benign (i.e., benign basal cell tumor, basal cell epithelioma, basa-
loid tumor, basaloma) or malignant (basal cell carcinoma). As most basal
cell tumors are benign (>90%) and carcinomas are generally of low-grade
malignancy with a low metastatic potential, the preferred nomenclature
is "basal cell tumor" for both benign and malignant tumors. Basal cell
carcinomas are more common in the cat than in the dog. Tumors arise
from epidermal basal cells and usually affect the head, neck, limbs, and
thorax. See Figure 18-1A. Basal cell carcinomas more commonly arise
from the nasal planum and eyelids. See Figure 18-1B. They appear as well 
circumscribed, solitary, 0.5- to 10.0-cm (0.25- to 4-inch) raised, ulcerated,
hairless, lesions, which are occasionally melanotic or cystic. Occasionally
multiple tumors may be found in the same patient. Tumors are typically
fixed to the overlying skin and are freely movable. Tumors are often slow
(A)
growing and may be present for months prior to diagnosis. All breeds are
affected, although Siamese (carcinoma) and Himalayan and Persian
(benign basal cell tumor) breeds may be predisposed to basal cell tumor
development. There is no known etiology, although a strong correlation
exists in humans between ultraviolet light exposure and tumor forma-
tion. Clinical signs are limited to the presence of the mass. Differential
diagnoses include squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, mast cell tumor,
cutaneous hemangioma or hemangiosarcoma, hair follicle tumors, and
sebaceous gland tumors.

Bite Wounds: Felines
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
The territoriality of the cat is largely responsible for its fighting behavior,
whether it is the aggressor or the territory defender. The typical feline
bite wound is due to a tooth that penetrates the skin and underlying
tissue, leaving a lesion of minimal diameter but substantial depth.
Within a few hours, the skin puncture closes, entrapping bacteria from
the cat's mouth and debris, which were carried into the wound. Aerobic
and anaerobic bacterial infections are common. The three stages are pre-
abscess (swelling and pain), abscessation (focal pocket of pus), and post-
abscess (abscess drains spontaneously through the skin). Abscessation
Occurs about 3 to 5 days after the bite. If not surgically opened, it will

Some cats develop chronic draining tracts due to resistant bacteria,
Mycoplasma, Mycobacterium, or fungal infections, the presence of foreign
bodies or bone sequestra within the wound, or immunosuppressive
states associated with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or the
feline leukemia virus (FeLV).

● Retroviral Tests: Cats with recurrent or nonresponsive abscesses
should be tested for FeLV and FIV. Although the FeLV antigen test

exposed before vaccine-induced immunity occurs.
 The clinical signs are based on the fact that the FCV replicates in epi-
thelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, conjunctiva, tongue, and in
 pneumocytes in the pulmonary alveoli. The most consistent clinical sign
of an FCV infection is sneezing; other common signs include fever, nasal

occurs due to fever, oral ulceration, or nasal congestion and can lead to
dehydration and death. Less frequently, various strains of FCV cause
polyarthritis, ulceration of the nasal planum, or interstitial pneumonia.
The FCV can be isolated from the mouths of the vast majority of cats with
lymphoplasmacytic stomatitis-gingivitis. If it is etiologically involved it
is due to an immune response to the virus and not the virus itself.
 Transmission primarily occurs by direct contact between cats involv-

tinguish from a mesothelioma. As with mesothelioma, malignant epi-
thelial effusions may develop secondary to exudation from the primary
tumor, inflammation associated with the primary tumor, and diffuse
lymphatic metastasis/obstruction. Malignant effusions are generally
present within the body cavity where the primary tumor is identified
but may also develop in other body cavities secondary to lymphatic
metastasis. Solid metastasis to other organs may also be seen. See

CHAPTER 31
Cataracts
Shelby L. Reinstein and Harriet J. Davidson
Overview
 The lens is an avascular, transparent tissue that functions to refract light
onto the retina. When the lens is diseased, a loss of transparency often
 manifests as an opacity, or cataract, within the lens. Nuclear sclerosis is
a normal aging change and should be differentiated from cataracts.
Nuclear sclerosis results from an increased density of the central portion
of the lens as it ages; it is visible as a bluish opacity in the center of the
lens. Nuclear sclerosis does not affect vision unless advanced; however,
cataracts can progress and cause blindness. Additionally, cataracts often
induce a secondary uveitis (see Chapter 223), which can lead to gla uucoma
(see Chapter 85).
 There are many methods used to classify cataracts. It is helpful to
determine the age of onset, stage of progression, location, and cause of
a cataract.

CHAPTER 32
Ceruminous Gland Disease
Mark Robson
Overview
Ceruminous glands are modified apocrine glands that exist throughout
the deeper connective tissue of the external ear canal extending onto the
 pinna. Their oily secretions are combined with those of sebaceous glands
to result in the formation of cerumen.
 The ducts of ceruminous glands often open into the infundibulum of
hair follicles but may also open directly to the epidermal surface, a
feature not seen with apocrine glands.
Disease of these glands can be described as hyperplastic, cystic, or
neoplastic. Ceruminous gland neoplasia (i.e., benign and malignant) in 
cats is not common, but it is the most frequently seen tumor of the ear
canal in the feline. See Figures 32-1 and 32-2. In one study of 176 tumors
the ratio of adenomas-to-carcinomas was 45:55. Neoplasia appears to be

 that required a total ear canal ablation.
It can be difficult or impossible to tell the difference on visual examina-
tion between different forms of ceruminous gland disease and to deter-
mine whether the lesion is of ceruminous gland origin or represents
another lesion such as an inflammatory polyp, melanoma, or squamous
 cell carcinoma. Ceruminous gland lesions can appear as single or mul-
tiple masses and can be darkly pigmented. Ceruminous gland disease
can occur anywhere within the canal and can penetrate the tympanum
and enter the middle ear.
 Any patient with chronic otitis externa should be suspected of having
a neoplasm, and strenuous efforts should be made to properly examine
the entire ear canal and tympanum. Examination of the feline ear canal
Can be difficult due to the presence of exudate, tissue swelling, hyperpla-
sia, and pain. Proper evaluation will often involve general anesthesia.
Treating the infection first may permit visualization without anesthesia.
 Ear swabs alone are a poor method of diagnosing a mass as the cytol-
ogy will be dominated by inflammation and infection.Fine-needle aspi-
ration (FNA) has been shown to be quite accurate in differentiating
inflammatory polyps from neoplastic change but much less accurate at
differentiating a ceruminous gland adenoma from a carcinoma or ceru-
minous gland neoplasia from other forms of cancer. Histopathology
remains the most accurate means of diagnosis and can be achieved with
incisional biopsy pending decisions on wider resection and possible ear
canal ablation.
The clinical signs of ceruminous gland disease are similar to other
inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic syndromes. They include head
shaking, ear pawing or scratching, otic odor, pain, pruritus, head tilt,
folding over of the pinna, malaise, and anorexia.

tion. About 5 to 10% of unvaccinated cats have antibodies against C. felis.
The prevalence of C. felis in cats with ocular or upper respiratory tract
infection ranges from 11 to 32%. In clinically healthy cats, the prevalence
of C. felis is reported to be up to 13%. Cats can be asymptomatic carriers
of the infection, but as a resultof stressor immunosuppression, the latent
infection can be reactivated and clinical signs develop.
 Transmission of infection requires close contact with infected cats and
their aerosols, but the infection may also be transmitted via fomites.
Ocular secretion is probably the most important body fluid for infection.
Conjunctival shedding usually ceases at around 60 days after infection,
but cats with persistent infections may excrete the infectious agent for
up to 8 months.
 C. felis may occur simultaneously with other upper respiratory tract
pathogens, such as the feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) and feline calicivirus
(FCV). Both Mycoplasma felis and Bordetella bronchiseptica can complicate
C. felis infection.
Chlamydophila felis is not solely an ocular and respiratory tract patho-
gen. Instead, it may become systemic. It has been isolated from the
rectum and vagina of cats. Therefore, intestinal and reproductive tracts
are suggested to be sites of persistent infection.
 Following an infection, immunity is generally weak and short in
duration. There is age-related resistance of cats to C. felis infection

· Clinical Signs: Dyspnea with systemic signs will occur. Coughing
may also occur. Affected cats typically demonstrate forced inspira-
tion with delayed expiration, as though they are holding their breath.
· Auscultation: Muffled heart and lung sounds are found.
● Radiography: Radiographic signs of pleural effusion include visual-
ization of pleural fissure lines and scalloping of the lung borders.
Atelectic lung lobes should not be mistaken for a thoracic mass.
Radiographs are most meaningful following thoracentesis. Note the
caudal pulmonary arteries as an indication of heartworm disease and
observe for an anterior mediastinal mass. Note the presence of
rounded lung lobes as an indication of fibrosing pleuritis.
● Ultrasound: This should be performed before fluid is removed from
the pleural space if the cat's respiratory status permits. It may be
helpful in establishing the presence of an anterior mediastinal mass
or detecting pericardial or cardiac disease. Occasionally, heartworms
 can be visualized in the right side of the heart or in the pulmonary
trunk.

CHAPTER 39
Coccidiosis
Mark Robson and Mitchell A. Crystal
Overview
Coccidia are obligate intracellular parasites usually found in the small
intestine. There are several genera of coccidia that infect cats, most com-
monly Isospora (se Table 39-1; for information regarding Toxoplasma
gondi, refer to Chapter 214; for information regarding Cryptosporidium
spp, refer to Chapter 44). Coccidia are acquired via ingestion of mono-
Zoic cysts in intermediate host tissue or sporulated oocysts from infected
feces. There is generally no extra-intestinal involvement in the cat, and
transplacental and transmammary infection does not occur.
Cats are the definitive host for Isospora felis and Isospora rioolta, and
infection with these species rarely causes disease. Kittens younger than
1 month old, and cats that are stressed, immunosuppressed, or in
crowded (e.g., catteries) or unsanitary conditions are at a higher risk of
developing clinical signs. Physical examination may be normal or reveal
40μm
evidence of diarrhea, hematochezia, weight loss, and dehydration.
Death may occur in severely affected animals.
Cats are also the definitive host for Hammondia hammondi, Besnoitia
walacei, B. darlingi, and B. oryctofelisi. Cats become infected from ingest-
ing tissue cysts in the intermediate host, commonly rodents. Infection is
generally limited to the gastrointestinal tract; however, Besnoitia may be
found in extra-intestinal organs. These species are considered to be
non-pathogenic.
Cats are an intermediate host for Sarcocystis neurona of which the
definitive host is the opossum. Infection is acquired by direct ingestion
of sporocysts shed in opossum feces. S. neurona can cause a fatal
encephalomyelitis in kittens, although limited studies have found
serum antibodies in 5% of domestic and 13% of feral cats indicating that 
exposure is not uncommon. Many other Sarcocystis spp. have been iden-
tified in the intestinal tract of cats and, rarely, skeletal and cardiac

Primary Therapeutics
· Fluid Therapy: Fluid therapy is essential to aid in softening
the stool in dehydrated cats. Intravenous or subcutaneous adminis-
tration is preferred to oral rehydration therapy. See Chapter 302.
● Enemas: This is indicated as the initial step in the medical manage-
ment of constipation/obstipation. This is best performed following
fluid administration and with the cat under anesthesia. The enema
should utilize 15 to 20mL/kg of warm water without soap or other
additives (to minimize mucosal irritation and damage). The volume
delivered should be repeated several times to completely empty the
colon. Manual evacuation via abdominal palpation and rectal digital
manipulation should be performed in conjunction with enema

administration for maximal colonic evacuation. A small amount of 
water-soluble lubrication will help in removing feces. In cats with
mild constipation, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate enemas may be
sufficient.
· Prokinetics: Cisapride has proven beneficial in managing constipa-
tion in cats. It has been removed from the human market because
of side effects but is still available through veterinary compound-
ing pharmacies. For cats up to 10 pounds, the dose is 2.5mg/cat
q8h PO given 30 minutes before feeding. Cats heavier than 10
pounds may receive a dose up to 5mg/cat q8h PO given 30 minutes 
before feeding.
● Diet: Easily digestible, low-bulk diets are indicated. Supple-
mentation with small amounts of fiber (e.g. psyllium [Vetasyl,
Metamucil]) at 2.5-5mL (1/2-1 teaspoons or 1.7-3.4g) q12 to 24h
PO with food or canned pumpkin at 2.5 to 5mL (1-2 teaspoons)
q12 to 24h PO with food may help soften the stool and stimulate
defecation; however, diets high in fiber often create excessive fecal
bulk and may complicate or worsen colonic distention.

 Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) is an extremely common ocular disease
in cats. Cats are frequently exposed to the virus at birth. Although vac-
cination against herpesvirus is common, the vaccine does not produce
sterilizing immunity. Therefore, infection and ocular disease may still
occur in vaccinated cats. The virus has a propensity for the corneal epi-
thelium but may replicate within the conjunctiva. The virus may become
latent and establish itself within the trigeminal ganglia. After an initial
corneal infection, nearly S0% of cats will have latent infections, with
upward of 45% of those cats having reoccurrence of clinical disease. Cats
can develop keratitis at anytime in their life cycle, but kittens and elderly
cats are most likely to become symptomatic as they have a lower immune
defense. Cats that are latently infected are prone to re-ulceration during
the juvenile state at the onset of estrus and under stress. Stress of any
type or systemic steroid administration can allow viral recrudescence
resulting in development of clinical signs.

Therapeutic Notes
● Typically, coughing is not a life-threatening or debilitating problem
for cats, although it may be a sign of serious disease.
● In general, it is not necessary or even desirable to suppress the cough.
One's efforts should be directed at determining and treating the
underlying cause. Response to steroids in a coughing cat has been
used as an indirect test for asthma. However, cats with heartworms
will also have a cough that responds to steroids and may be more
ommon than asthma in heartworm endemic areas.
Prognosis
 The prognosis is variable depending upon the underlying disease.

CHAPTER 43
cryptococcos1s
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
Infection with Cryptococcus is observed regularly in cats. At present, this
genus includes two species important to veterinary medicine: C. neofor-
mans, which has a global distribution, and C. gatti, which has a more
limited distribution and is associated with cases reported in Australia,
British Columbia, and the Pacific Northwest of the United States.
Cryptococcosis is the only systemic fungal infection observed more
bird feces (especially the alkaline, nitrogen-enriched droppings of
pigeons), although many infected cats have no known contact with
pigeon excreta. Birds rarely become infected because of their high body
temperature. Environmental exposure and risk factors for C. gatti are
still being determined, but disease risk appearslinked to the presence of
trees (both eucalyptus, as well as other species) or proximity to com-
mercial soil disruption or logging. The exact mode of infection is
unknown but probably occurs through inhalation of airborne organisms
since the upper respiratory tract is the most common primary site of
infection. The age range of affected cats is broad. Some studies have
found male cats at increased risk, but other reports have failed tosupport
this observation. It has been suggested that the Siamese, Birman, and 
Ragdoll breeds may be over-represented.

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other immune-deficient
states is well documented; in contrast, several reports have found that
suggest that, at least in humans, C. gatti should be considered a primary
pathogen because of its potential to infect immunocompetent hosts.
 Although cats infected with the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and
feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) represent states of cell-mediated
immune deficiency comparable to HIV, potential for retroviruses to
predispose to infection by either C. meoformans or C. gattii has not
been clearly established. Most published reports have evaluated only
C. neoformans and findings have been inconsistent, though there is
some evidence that FeLV-infected cats may not respond as well to
treatment as healthy cats and that they are more prone to relapse.
Further clarification is needed regarding the roles of risk factors and
underlying disease in feline cryptococcosis.
 The organism appears to have the greatest affinity for the upper respi-
ratory system, with the nervous and integumentary systems also com-
 monly involved. Unlike in humans, the lower airways usually remain

TABLE 43-1: Protocol for Subcutaneous Administration of Amphotericin B
1. Preparation of suspension: Add 10mL sterile distilled water to a 50-mg vial of amphotericin B deoxycholate (Fungizone, Bristol Myers Squibb,
 Princeton, NJ) to produce a 5-mg/ml colloidal suspension.
2. Storage: The vial may be frozen for storage for up to 4 weeks. When the drug is needed, the vial may be thawed and the needed amount
 aseptically withdrawn from the vial. Return to freezer for refreezing and storage.
3. Preparation of subcutaneous infusion: Take a 500-mL bag of 0.45% sodium chloride in 2.5% dextrose, warm to 40°C in a microwave oven, and 
then connect to an administration set. Discard 100 to 50ml of the bag. Add the calculated dose of amphotericin B stock suspension via the

several times to ensure transfer of all drug to the bag.
4. Administration of drug: Attach a 19- or 21-gauge to the administration set, then insert the needle into the subcutaneous space between the
scapulae (roughly on the midline). Allow the fluid to flow as fast as gravity will permit; elevating the bag will facilitate delivery. It usually takes 10 to
15 minutes to deliver the entire volume (350-400 mL). The entire volume is given in one site unless the cat is visibly uncomfortable after half the
solution is delivered. The fluid tends to move extensively throughout the subcutaneous space, with ventral pooling several hours after delivery.
 5. Treatment schedule: This formulation is typically administered two to three times per week.

of salt to the diet may also be renoprotective. (b) Monitor blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine closely and at least temporarily discontinue

Overview
Cytauxzoonosis is caused by the small protozoan hemoparasite
Cytauxzoon felis. A tissue or schizogenous phase in which schizont rep-
lication occurs within tissue macrophages leads to vascular obstruction
 and severe clinical disease or death. There is also an erythrocytic phase

hemolytic anemia. Cytauxzoon infection is most common in the south
central and southeastern United States, but there is some evidence that
the organism is spreading to other regions. Infection is acquired from
tick vectors; Dermacentor variabilis and (experimentally) Amblyomma

Bobcats serve as an asymptomatic reservoir host. Outdoor cats with
exposure to tick vectors are more at risk of developing the disease.

The prognosis for cats with diabetic neuropathy is variable. Some cats
have a return to normal leg function. Others show no response even with

 Diabetic Nephropathy

Diabetic nephropathy is thought to occur in diabetic cats; however,
its detection is complicated by the fact that most diabetic cats are

·Arrhythmias associated with DH are usually seen 24 to 72 hours after
trauma and are difficult to control with anti-arrhythmics. They
usually resolve spontaneously within 5 days.

SECTION 1: Diseases and Conditions
· Pimobendan: This inodilator is also recommended to strengthen
contractility and provide some vasodilation. Recommended dose
range is 0.1 to 0.3mg/kg q12h PO. Pimobendan is not currently
licensed in the United States for use in cats.
· Taurine Supplementation: Give to maintain normal plasma taurine
levels (60-120μmol/L). The normal dose is 250 to 500mg q24h.
● Anticoagulation: Give aspirin (10mg/kg PO twice weekly) to pos-
sibly prevent blood clots. In one study though, no significant differ-
ence was found in survival or recurrence rate between cats receiving
the traditional dose and cats receiving low-dose aspirin (5mg q72h).
Recurrence of thrombi occurs at a high rate (43.5%) even with anti-
coagulation. Cats with left atrial enlargement, especially greater than
20mm in diameter, are at greatest risk for aortic thromboembolism.
Consider also antithrombotic agents such as clopidogrel (18.75mg
[one-fourth of 75-mg tablet]) q24h PO; unfractionated heparin (200
units/kg q8h SC); low molecular weight heparin (daltaperin [100
units/kg q12-24h SC] or enoxaparin [1 mg/kg q12-24h SC]).
· Spironolactone: This drug is used at subdiuretic dose for conges-
(A)
tive heart failure. It is dosed at 0.5 to 1.0mg/kg q12 to 24h PO.
Therapeutic Notes
· Aggressive diuretic therapy is continued until respiratory distress
resolves and is followed by a reduction in dose to maintain a normal
respiratory rate (usually less than 40 breaths per minute).
● Maintenance furosemide doses usually range from 6.25mg q24h PO
to 12.5 mg q8h PO.

· Taurine supplementation may be discontinued once echocardio-
graphic values return to within normal limits and dietary taurine
intake is deemed satisfactory. However, the serum taurine level
should be rechecked 30 to 60 days after discontinuing taurine
 supplementation.

● Feline idiopathic cystitis is the most common cause of dysuria/pol-

life-threatening disease as long as it does not lead to urethral
obstruction. It is also self-limiting in most cats in 7 to 14 days.
Therefore, it is common practice to diagnose this disease based on

CHAPTER 62
Ear Mites
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
Otoacariasis, infestation by the ear mite Otodectes cymotis, is common in
cats and is responsible for at least half of all cases of feline otitis externa.
 Kitens most frequently become infested by contact with the queen or
other infested kittens. These highly contagious mites live on the skin
surface and are nonburrowing. They irritate the ceruminous glands of
the ear, causing the canal to fill with cerumen, blood, and mite excreta.
As the mite feeds on the host's epidermal debris and tissue fluid, the cat
is exposed to mite salivary antigen; some cats eventually become sensi-
tized. In one study, wheal and flare reactions (Type I hypersensitivity)
and Arthus-type reactions (Type Ml hypersensitivity) were noted in large
numbers of random cats following exposure to mite antigen. Sensitized
cats may develop intense otic pruritus with the presence of only a few
mites, although the immune system is normally able to limit the severity
of infestations in healthy mature cats.
 The mites are not host specific. Also, because humans are occasionally
infested, O. cymotis must be considered a possible zoonotic ectoparasite.
 The presence of a brownish or blackish ear discharge, shaking the

(Demodex cati), pediculosis, and chiggers.
· Clinical Signs: Clinical signs are described in the Overview.
● Otic Examination: The white mites are often seen moving in response
to the warmth of the otoscope light. Although they are relatively
large in comparison to some other mites, they cannot be seen in the
ear canal without magnification. The canals should be thoroughly
examined; when possible, patency of the tympanic membrane should 
be determined.
· Cytology: Some of the debris from the ear canal may be rolled onto
each of two microscope slides with a cotton swab. Two or three drops
of mineral oil can be applied to the first slide. On scanning (4x) or
low (10x) power, mites will be observed "swimming" in the oil. Mite 
eggs can sometimes be found, even when adult mites are not present.
The second slide may be stained with a modified Wright's stain to
determine the presence of yeasts or bacteria.
Diagnostic Notes
· Although some cats have an extreme response to the presence
 of ear mites, others are relatively asymptomatic.
· A dark ear discharge is also common in yeast infections. Cytology is
needed to differentiate otoacariasis from yeast otitis.
Figure 62-1  Ear mites can be intensely pruritic to the external ear canals resulting in
scratching that may cause a wound caudal to the pinna.

vary depending on the type of skin lesion present See Table 66-1.
Regardless of the type of skin lesion present, EGC skin lesions can be
secondarily infected. If an infection is present, it needs to be treated.
Diagnosis
Primary Diagnostics
● Allergy Work-Up: Allergies are most commonly associated with cats
developing EGC. Allergies that can cause EGC include flea allergy
dermatitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis.
Flea combing, fea or mosquito antigen intradermal skin tests, or
response to flea control aid in determining whether flea allergy der-
matitis is an underlying cause.(See Figures 66-1A, 66-1B, and 66-1C)
An 8- to 12-week food elimination diet with a food rechallenge to
prove or disprove food allergies is present is also a useful diagnostic
tool. See Chapter 82. Intradermal allergy testing is a sensitive and
useful test for diagnosing atopic dermatitis. Contact allergies rarely
cause EGC and are difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis of contact
(A)
allergy is most commonly performed by history and distribution
pattern. Patch testing exists, but the veterinarian needs to select
contact allergensin the environment that may be causing this problem.
No predetermined contact allrgy panels exist for patch testing.
● Biopsy: Skin biopsies of affected lesions are useful for diagnosing
EGC. If ulcerative lesions are present, the biopsy sample should be
collected at the junction between the normal and ulcerated skin. If
nodules or plaques are present, the biopsy punch should penetrate
the center of the lesion. Eosinophilic ulcer (i.e., feline indolent ulcer,
"rodent ulcer", see Figure 66-2) shows hyperplastic, ulcerated, super-
ficial perivascular to interstitial dermatitis. Fibrosis may also be

Overview
Eosinophilic keratitis is a unique inflammatory condition of the feline
cornea that is most often unilateral. There are occasional reports of this
 condition in horses as well, but it has never been reported in the dog.
Sometimes the condition is referred to as proliferative keratoconjunctivi-

malities or altered motility.
● Endoscopy: Definitive diagnosis requires endoscopy, which will
readily demonstrate the presence of esophagitis, its severity, and the
extent of the lesions.
· Plain Radiographs: These rarely show any abnormalities.
Treatment
● Mild/superficial Cases: Food is withheld for 24 to 48 hours and then
reintroduced. A soft, low-fat, high-protein diet should ideally be
used. A diet of this composition improves the lower esophageal tone
and minimizes delays in gastric emptying. Combining this with
short-term use of mucosal protectants and antacids may be curative.
● Moderate to Severe Cases: More aggressive therapy is needed, pos-
sibly for several weeks. If esophageal "rest" is considered beneficial
to allow adequate healing, consideration should be given to placing

a gastrostomy tube. This can be valuable for 5 to 10 days during the
initial healing process, but oral therapy in the form of mucosal pro-
 tectants should not withheld during this period.
● Mucosal Protectants: Sucralfate suspension (100-200 mg/kg q8-12h
PO) forms a protective barrier over the ulcerated mucosa. Gastric
antacids reduce gastric acidity and help prevent further damage
during reflux. Suitable drugs include ranitidine (1-2mg/kg q8-12h
PO), famotidine (0.5mg/kg q12-24h PO), and omeprazole (0.7 mg/
kg q24h PO). Anti-inflammatory drugs (prednisolone at 1-2mg/kg
q24h for 24 weeks) may help limit further inflammation and fibrosis.
In the presence of significant and deep inflammatory changes, it may
be prudent to provide antibiotic cover during the use of predniso-
lone. In the presence of severe pain, oral lidocaine gel may also be of
valule.
Prognosis
 Response to therapy should be monitored with serial endoscopy, which
will also allow early treatment of stricture formation if this occurs. In
many cases, early aggressive therapy will produce a very good outcome.
Esophageal Stricture
Overview
Stricture formation (fibrosis and scar tissue) is usually an end result
of severe esophageal trauma or esophagitis. The site of the stricture
can be extremely variable, and, although some are focal, others can

· Balloon Catheter Dilatation: See Figure 69-3. This produces radial
forces to stretch as opposed to the shearing forces induced by using
bouginage. Depending on the size of the stricture, a ballon with a

larger diameter balloons can be used over time as the stricture dilates.
The balloon is passed into the esophagus and, under endoscopic
guidance, it is placed so that the stricture is approximately central in
the length of the balloon. The balloon is inflated to a pressure of 
approximately 30 to 50 psi and held at this pressure for 45 to 60
seconds before deflating. Once deflated the esophagus should be re-
examined endoscopically. If minimal damage or mucosal tearing

SECTION 1: Diseases and Conditions
Treatment
● Postural Feeding with Small, Frequent Meals: If postural feeding
cannot be achieved, holding the cat up after feeding with its head 
higher than its body for 5 to 15 minutes may be equally effective.
· Food Type: Feeding foods of various consistencies to find which is 
best tolerated. Although feeding liquid or semi-liquid foods appears
logical, some cats tolerate dry food better. This can only be deter-
mined by trial and error. However, one should feed high quality,
calorie-dense foods.
● Pro-Motility Agents: The use of pro-motility agents (i.e., metoclo-
pramide and cisapride) can be tried, but generally the response to
these agents in cats with megaesophagus is poor.
· Spontaneous Resolution: Occasional spontaneous resolution of 
cases of idiopathic megaesophagus has been reported. The mecha-
nism of disease and resolution in these cases has not been deter-
mined. If there is concomitant esophagitis or inhalation pneumonia,
appropriate therapy for these should be instituted.

than the canine dose; the canine dose is not effective.
● Ethanol 20%: Use if fomepizole is not available. It should be given
as soon as the diagnosis is made, but it must be within the first 6
hours post-ingestion. To make a 20% solution, remove 105mL from
a 500-mL bag of normal saline and replace 105mL of 95% grain

measurement of total proteolytic activity in feces using one of several
different assay methods. X-ray film digestion, the most popular tech-
nique, is highly unreliable and should not be used. Radial enzyme
diffusion using a suitable substrate, such as casein, is considered more
reliable. However, false-positive results can be observed because pro-
teolytic enzymes are highly unstable in fecal material. False-negative
results have also been described. Three stool samples from consecu-
tive days should be evaluated and the fecal samples must be frozen
immediately and sent on ice to preserve fecal proteolytic activity.
· Serum Cobalamin Concentration: Serum cobalamin concentration is
decreased in almost all cats with EPl due to the fact that in cats more
than 99% of intrinsic factor is secreted by the exocrine pancreas.
Intrinsic factor binds to cobalamin, and the cobalamin/intrinsic
factor complexes are absorbed by specific receptors in the ileum.
Unfortunately, a subnormal serum cobalamin concentration is not
specific for EPl, and cats with chronic gastrointestinal diseases other
than EPI commonly have a decreased serum cobalamin concentration.

CHAPTER 72
Eyelid Diseases and Surgery

Overview
The feline eyelids or palpebrae consist of four basic layers from deep
to superficial: conjunctiva, tarsal plate, muscle, and skin. The conjunc-
tiva covers the sclera then turns back on itself at the conjunctival
fornix of both the upper and lower eyelids to cover their inner aspects.
The tarsal plate is a band of thickened connective tissue which sepa-
rates the conjunctiva from the muscle layer and helps maintain the
eyelids' shape. The major muscles of importance in the eyelids are
the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which is responsible for elevat-
ing the upper eyelid, and the orbicularis oculi muscle, which surrounds
the palpebral fissure causing the eyelids to close when it contracts.
These muscles are innervated by cranial nerve (CN) IIl and CN VII,
respectively. In contrast to many other species, cats do not have true
upper or lower eyelashes. Most cats do have a row of hairs close to
the lid margin that function similarly to true eyelashes. Lining the
eyelid margins are the ductal openings to the meibomian glands,
which secrete the oily component of the tear film. Smaller Glands of
Moll and Glands of Zeis are found in close association with hair
follicles along the lid margin. In comparison to dogs, cats are relatively

Congenital and Inherited Conditions
Eyelid Agenesis
This condition occurs sporadically and is the most common congenital
abnormality of the feline eyelid. In the vast majority of cases the uper,
temporal eyelid is affected, but the amount of tissue missing from the
eyelid varies (see Figure 72-1). Usually the condition is bilateral.
Diagnosis is based on appearance of the lesion. Affected animals will not
have a continuous eyelid margin as the lid is followed from medial to
lateral. The condition may be associated with congenital intraocular
abnormalities as well. Sequelae include exposure keratitis and mechani-
cal irritation from facial hairs, which are able to contact the cornea
without an intact eyelid. These conditions can lead to severe scarring.
discomfort, and loss of the globe if deep corneal ulceration results.
Treatment is usually surgical, and the method employed depends on the
size of the defect. Small defects (less than one-fourth of the eyelid
margin) may be closed directly by incising the edges of the missing
portion of the lid, carefully apposing the eyelid margins, and then sut-
ing the defect. Cryotherapy to destroy the follicles of irritating hairs may
be sufficient to reduce discomfort and corneal disease if the defect is

of age, and is most common in brachycephalic breeds including
Persians and in the Maine coon, but it can be seen in any breed. In
brachycephalics the entropion often involves the medial lower eyelid.
Older cats can also be affected by entropion secondary to loss of orbital
fat as part of the aging process.
Most entropion in cats can be corrected surgically with a modified
Hotz-Celsus procedure. Eyelid position should be assessed while the
cat is awake and under topical anesthetic, so any spastic component is
minimized, to determine how much tissue should be removed.
Ectopic Cilia
This condition has been rarely reported in the cat. Hair(s) can grow from
the palpebral conjunctiva along the posterior lid and contact the cornea
 causing irritation and ulceration. Often corneal ulcers associated with
 this condition are linear and oriented dorsoventrally. Treatment is surgi-
cal excision of the hair follicle and can be followed by cryotherapy.
Acguired Conditions
(A)
Blepharitis
 This condition presents as swelling and hyperemia of the eyelids with
variable involvement of the conjunctiva. Depending on the duration, the
periocular skin may be alopecic. Excoriations or ulcerations may be
present due to self-trauma because the condition can be painful or
pruritic.
Drug Reactions
Both systemic and topical medications can cause allergic reactions result-
ing blepharitis. It is common for cats to have severe localized reactions
A drug reaction should be considered with any acute swelling of the
conjunctiva and eyelids within 24 to 48 hours after starting a new medi-

FIP is found where the FECV is found, which is in virtually all shelters,
in nearly all catteries with more than six cats, and in 60% or more of
multicat households. FECV infection occurs by the fecal-oral route with
viral shedding occurring within a week of exposure. Shedding may
persist for 18 months or more, be persistent for 4 to 6 months followed
by intermittent periods of shedding, or the virus may be cleared within
6 to 8 months. However, reinfection resembling primary exposure often
occurs. Virus shedding is roughly proportional to coronavirus antibody

SECTION 1: Diseases and Conditions
As the disease become more clinically evident, lethargy and fever may
become consistent, and appetite suppression and weight loss may
become more progressive. The effusive form manifests itself as either
abdominal distension due to ascites or dyspnea due to pleural effusion.
Ocular and CNS involvement occur in less than 10% of cats with effusive
FIP. The most common ocular presentation is uveitis; many cats experi-
nation, hyperesthesia, seizures and palsy of the brachial, trigeminal,
facial, and sciatic nerves, convulsions, hydrocephalus, dementia, person-
ality changes, nystagmus, head tilt, and circling. Intact males may
develop scrotal enlargement due to peritonitis extension. Polyarthritis
due to generalized synovitis occurs frequently. The noneffusive form
produces CNS or ocular disease in about 60% of affected cats, and signs
related to specific organ failure may predominate.

Diagnosis
 Primary Diagnostics
· Combination Testing: Because there is not a single, simple consis-
tently diagnostic test, diagnosis is based on an accumulation of
factors. The odds of noneffusive FIP are high with the following:
· A young cat from a shelter or cattery.
· The presence of uveitis or CNS signs.
● Elevated serum proteins.
· Increased serum globulins and decreased serum albumin resulting
in an A-to-G ratio <0.6.
· A fever that is not antibiotic responsive.
· Leukopenia, especially if accompanied by leukocytosis.
· A nonregenerative anemia.
● The odds of effusive FIP are high with the following:

the high protein content. See Chapter 288.
●Immunohistochemical examination of cells in the fluid will be
 positive for viral antigens and is confirmatory.
· High levels of FIPV RNA will be detected with real time poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
● Histopathology: This is considered confirmatory when it reveals
 pyogranulomas (effusive FIP) or pyogranulomas (noneffusive FIP) in 
a cat with appropriate clinical, hematological, and serological
findings.
Secondary Diagnostics
· Aqueous Humor: They presence of increases in proteins and leuko-
cytes is consistent with non-effusive FIP.
· Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): This often shows increases in proteins
(>200mg/dL) and leukocytes (>100 cells/μL, consisting predomi-
nantly of neutrophils) when noneffusive FIP is present.
· FCoV Antibody Tests (Titers): These can be helpful but not diagnos-

Flukes: Liver, Biliary, and Pancreatic
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
The cat may be infected with several species of flukes, including
Amphimerus pseudofelineus, Opisthorcus tenuicollis,Metorchus conjunctus,
and Platynosomum concinnum. The latter, P concinru is the most
common, with 15 to 85% of outdoor cats in an endemic area being
affected. Infections are limited to cats living in semitropical climates
(including Hawaii and south Florida in North America) and exposed to
two intermediate hosts. P concinmum is about 2.0 to 3.5mm and lives in
the bile ducts and gall bladder; it is occasionally found in the small
intestine and pancreas. The first intermediate host is the land snail. The
second intermediate host is most commonly a lizard (thus the term lizard
poisoning), but it may be the Bufo toad, skink, or gecko. Adult flukes
develop about 1 week after ingestion of the second intermediate host,
and ova can be detected in the cat's feces about 2 to 3 months later. Many
infected cats are asymptomatic, and others have nonspecific signs
including vomiting, diarrhea, inappetence, and weight loss. Icterus and 
peripheral eosinophilia are often present. The latter begins three weeks
after infection and persists for months. Beca use these signs are common
in many other diseases, the detection of fluke ova does not necessarily
 mean that flukes are the causative agent.

CHAPTER 82
Food Reaction
Christine A. Rees
Overview
Food reactions or allergies are the second most common allergy in cats.
This allergic reaction can occur at any age. Unlike atopic dermatitis,
which is usually seasonal, food allergies are a nonseasonal pruritic
problem. Cats are different from other species in that the pruritus can
be subtle in cats. In many cats, the pruritus is manifested as excessive
grooming. Food reactions or allergies do not typically respond to ste-
roids. The types of skin lesions that can be seen include barbed alopecia,
complete alopecia, erythema, miliary dermatitis, eosinophilic granuloma
complex, excoriations, crusts and scale. See Figures 82-1A and 82-1B.
Diarrhea, Malassezia dermatitis, and ceruminous otitis may also be seen
in the food allergic cat. See Chapters 66, 131, 140, and 157.

to atopy. These signs include recurrent otitis externa, pruritus,
military dermatitis, eosinophilic plaque, and other forms of eosino-
philic granuloma complex, excessive grooming, and nonseasonal
skin problem.
● Food Trial: A food elimination diet and food rechallenge is the only
way to definitively diagnose food allergies in cats. Options for food
elimination diets include hydrolyzed protein diets or a novel protein
source diet (i.e., duck and green pea, rabbit and green pea, venison
and green pea, and so on). The chosen diet should be fed for 8 to 12
weeks. At the end of the food elimination diet trial period the cat
should be rechallenged to the old food to prove or disprove a food
allergy. The clinical signs will reappear within 1 to 2 weeks after the
cat is rechallenged to the offending food ingredient.

● Diet Manipulation: After the cat is rechallenged with the old diet the

food ingredients to determine which food ingredient or ingredients
are causing the allergic reaction. After the individual offending food

CHAPTER 83
Giardiasis
Mark Robson and Mitchell A. Crystal
Overview
Giardia duodenalis (also known as Giardia intestinalis and Giardia lamblia)
that causes acute or chronic diarrhea, occasionally malabsorption and,
rarely, vomiting. Giardia exists in two forms: (a) the cyst form, which is
shed in the feces, can survive for months in wet, cool conditions in the
environment, and is infective to other animals and, (b) the trophozoite
form that develops in the small intestine from ingested cysts and causes
clinical signs. Giardia is acquired via ingestion of infected feces or con-
taminated food or water. There is no extra-intestinal migration, and
transplacental and transmammary infections do not occur. Once

Hyperproteinemia due to hyperglobulinemia is seen in about half of
the cats with GSPC. The presence of azotemia with alow urine specific
gravity suggests renal disease as a concurrent or causative condition.

Treatment
Primary Therapeutics
● Emergency Treatment: Many times cats will present with IOP greater
than 50mm Hg. It is critical to lower the IOP to a near normal value
(A)
Osmotic diuretics are most commonly used in the emergency setting.
These medications reduce IOP by dehydrating the vitreous body in
the eye. Therefore, they are most effective if water is withheld for up
to 4 hours. The systemic effectiveness of these medications can be
monitored using the normal eye as IOP should lower in the normal
eye as well.
● Intravenous Mannitol: Mannitol should be administered through
an intravenous catheter at a dose of 1.0 to 1.5gm/kg once slowly
(over 15-20 minutes). If ineffective in 30 minutes, the dose may be
repeated once.
● Glycerin (50 or 70% solution): This is given at 1 gm/kg PO. It may
 be repeated once in 30 minutes. This substance has a foul taste and
may be difficult to administer; an orogastric tube is preferable. It
has been known to cause vomiting.
● Maintenance Therapy: These drugs may be used in various combina-
tions once the IOP has reached a normal level. Consultation or refer-
ral to a veterinary ophthalmologist should be considered for
long-term management.

Diagnosis
Primary Diagnostics
● Presentation: If a cat presents in distress with pulmonary signs, all
tests should be performed in consideration of the patient's condition.
Emergency treatment to restore proper oxygenation should take pre-
cedence over diagnostics until the cat is stable. Measurement of pO2
may assist in determining next best steps.
· Complete Blood Count (CBC): This should be part of the minimum
database. Eosinophilia or basophilia is found inconsistently in cats
with heartworms.
● Heartworm Serology: Both antigen and antibody tests should be
performed and are available as point-of-care in-house diagnostics and
through reference labs, the latter being the most sensitive. A positive
antigen test indicates the cat is harboring at least one adult female
heartworm. A positive antibody test means the cat has successfully
been infected with heartworms because all current tests identify anti-
bodies to various proteins from the L3 or L4 stage of worm develop-
ment. A positive antibody test cannot differentiate between a current
active infection and a recent one in which all the worms have died.
It has been documented that positive antibody tests are inconsistent

CHAPTER 89
Heinz Body
1 Hemolytic Anemia
and Methemoglobinemia
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
Oxidative agents cause two major types of injury to feline erythrocytes.
The first, Heinz body (HB) formation, occurs when feline hemoglobin is
denatured and precipitates on the erythrocyte membrane. Feline hemo-
globin is an easy target for oxidative injury because it contains more
MR
sulfhydryl groups per molecule than most other species. Additionally.
the feline spleen is relatively inefficient at removing HB aggregates from
the erythrocyte once they form. Consequently, even clinically normal
MC
cats have an occasional HB in circulation unlike most other species.
Irreversible cellular damage caused by HB formation leads to a primarily
extravascular hemolytic anemia when the erythrocyte reaches a critical
level of fragility and must be cleared from circulation. In a few situations,
HBs may form by means other than oxidative stress on the red blood
HB
cells (e.g:, propylene glycol), though the exact mechanism remains
unknown.
The second type of oxidative injury, methemoglobinemia, is revers-
ible; it develops when the ferrous (+2) iron of hemoglobin is oxidized to
the ferric (+3) state, rendering hemoglobin incapable of carrying oxygen.
Figure 89-1 Heinz bodies are seen on many of the erythrocytes in this field (HB). The
larger erythrocytes, called macrocytes (MC), and the metarubricyte (MR) are indicative
of bone marrow response to anemia.

CHAPTER 91
Hemangiosarcoma
Bradley R. Schmidt
Overview
Hemangiosarcoma is an uncommon malignant tumor characterized by
rapidly proliferating anaplastic cells derived from blood vessels and
lining blood-filled spaces. It generally develops in older cats. The most
common site of hemangiosarcoma development is the skin, followed by
the mesentery, spleen, liver, mediastinum, nasal cavity, oral cavity, and
other sites. When all abdominal forms are grouped together as visceral
hemangiosarcoma, cutaneous and visceral forms occur with similar fre-
quency Within the skin, cutaneous and subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma
and cutaneous hemangioma occur with similar frequency. The skin of
the head appears to be the most common locations for cats with cutane-
ous hemangiosarcoma (see Figure 91-1), but in one study the flank and
ventral abdominal regions were more common in cats with subcutane-
 ous hemangiosarcoma. See Figure 91-2. Ulceration, bleeding, and sub-
cutaneous hemorrhage are the most common clinical findings in cats
with cutaneous hemangiosarcoma, with an increase in size of the mass
associated with the hemorrhage being reported by many owners. Studies
vary with regard to the metastatic potential of cutaneous hemangiosar-
coma; however, metastasis may not be as common as with the visceral

forms. Of the visceral forms, hemangiosarcoma of the mesentery may
making the true site of origin diffcult to determine. Splenic hemangio-
sarcoma may be solitary or multiple. See Figure 91-3. Hepatic heman-
nodules in the hepatic parenchyma. See Figure 91-4. Clinical signs associ-
ated with visceral hemangiosarcoma include abdominal swelling and
dyspnea secondary to hemoabdomen, acute or intermittent weakness

and collapse, lethargy, and vocalization. Chylous effusion (ascites) has
also been reported. Abdominal, lung, and cardiac metastasis is common 
for mesenteric and splenic hemangiosarcoma but may be less common

imaging (MRI) may be helpful in determining the extent of the
disease prior to surgery.
· Minimum Date Base: A complete blood count (CBC), serum bio-
chemistry profile, urinalysis, and retroviral serology should be per-
formed to evaluate the overall health of the patient. Anemia is a
common finding in many cats secondary to hemorrhage. Other pos-
sible abnormalities may include thrombocytopenia, hypoprotein-
emia, azotemia that may be renal or prerenal in origin, hepatic
enzyme elevation, and hyperglobulinemia. Fragmented red blood
cells are not frequently reported in the cat in association with this
tumor.
· Coagulation Profile: A coagulation profile is recommended prior to
surgical procedures as well as to evaluate for a primary coagulopathy
as a cause for cavitary hemorrhage.
Diagnostic Notes
● With the possible exception of the cutaneous forms, hemangiosar-
coma should be considered a metastatic neoplasm.

 The mode of transmission is not fully understood but is suspected to
occur via blood-sucking arthropod vectors such as fleas, although this
has not been conclusively proven. The organism is effectively transmit-
ted in transfused blood. Also, queens have been known to pass the
infection to newborns kittens, but the mechanism of transmission has
not been determined.

Diagnostic Notes
· The minimum data base should include retrovirus testing. Where
appropriate, the cat should also be screened for toxoplasmosis (see
Chapter 214) and feline infectious peritonitis (see Chapter 76)
because these are associated with inflammatory liver disease and
pancreatitis.
· All cats with suspected liver disease should be evaluated at veni-
puncture sites after blood collection. Coagulation tests are not rou-
tinely predictive of bleeding potential, but a clinical clue may be
 provided by cutaneous hemorrhage or prolonged bleeding after
venipuncture. Clinical bleeding in cats with liver disease is uncom-
monly due to overt hepatic failure. It more likely results from vitamin
K deficiency caused by impaired bile acid efflux into the intestine
(necessary for absorption of fat-soluble vitamins), anorexia, and
impaired intestinal absorption due to concurrent inflammatory

cats and kittens. These viruses are especially problematic in stressful,
population-dense settings, such as shelters, boarding facilities, catteries,
and multicat households.
All ages of cats are susceptible to FHV-1, although it is particularly
virulent for young kittens. Therefore, early conferral of vaccine-induced
decline by 7 to 9 weeks of age, kittens have the opportunity for viral
exposure and successful infection before immunizations are started.
Additionally, residual maternal immunity may interfere with early vac-
cination efforts.
 Most cats that become infected with FHV-1 and recover will remain
infected for life because the virus becomes latent in neural tissue, espe-
cially the trigeminal ganglia. A lifelong course of relapsing disease inter-
posed with periods of viral quiescence is the hallmark of FHV-1.
Shedding may be reactivated during periods of stress, ilness or immu-
nosuppressive therapy. Parturition and lactation may reactivate the
virus in latently infected queens with subsequent infection of the kittens.

CHAPTER 97
Histoplasmosis
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
[eung odo au um uaun o adans  ede sie
organism Histoplasma capsulatum; however, most cats probably develop
only a transient, clinically inapparent infection. In North America, the
St. Lawrence, Missouri, and Misssippi River vallys and their related
tributaries are areas of endemic infection. The organism is commonly
associated with topsoil enriched by the nitrogen of bird and bat feces.
Most evidence supports a respiratory route of infection with hema-
togenous and lymphatic routes of dissemination, although primary
gastrointestinal infection has been reported. The infectious form (myce-
lial phase) lives in the environment; once inside the body, the organism
converts to the noninfectious yeast phase. Histoplasmosis is essentially
a disease of the mononuclear phagocyte system. A competent cell-
mediated immune response must be present to contain infection.
Infection with the feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency viruses
does not appear to predispose cats to histoplasmosis. Humans and
other pets are not at risk for the disease from contact with infected
(A)
cats but may become infected because of similar environmental
exposure.
 Diagnosis can be a challenge because most cats have disseminated
disease with a wide variety of vague, nonspecific signs, such as fever,
weight loss, depression, and anorexia. Less than half of infected cats
demonstrate organ-specific dysfunction. When signs are localizing, the
respiratory system is commonly affected, although coughing is uncom-
mon. See Figures 97-1 and Figure 291-40. Tachypnea, dyspnea, and

be more common with disseminated histoplasmosis than with any other
feline systemic mycosis, with both the anterior and posterior chambers
involved (anterior uveitis and granulomatous chorioretinitis). Intestinal 
histoplasmosis is much less common in cats than in dogs.
Because the clinical signs are often quite vague and non-localizing, the
differential diagnoses for feline histoplasmosis are extensive and should
include diseases that could cause fever, anemia, respiratory distress,
inflammatory ocular disease, bone lesions, or hepatosplenomegaly.

● Radiography: A fine, diffuse, or linear interstitial pattern in the lungs

osteolytic (see Figure 97-3), although concurrent osteoproduction
may be found.

pupil dilates incompletely or not at all. To further confirm a postgan-
glionic lesion, a dilute direct-acting sympathomimetic agent (1%

be administered in each eye. If the lesion is postganglionic, dilation
of the pupil will occur within 20 minutes due to denervation hyper-

is preganglionic.

· Surgical Management: Surgical removal of the abnormal adrenal
gland is the treatment of choice; the disease is usually unilateral.
However, although the tumors are usually adenomas, they are often
locally invasive, and there may be invasion of local blood vessels,
including the vena cava. In such cases, surgical management may be
much more challenging. If adrenalectomy is performed it is often
curative although the rare malignant forms have a poorer long-term
prognosis.

Emergency Treatment
● Urgency: Rapidly reduce pressure values below the high risk level
(180/120). Thisis indicated for acute retinal detachment or unrespon-
sive seizures.
● Nitroglycerin Paste: This reduces BP rapidly but is only effective for
about 48 hours. Apply 6mm (1/4 inch) to the concave side of the
pinna. If the pinna is cold (due to vasoconstriction), warm it before

drug application to increase absorption. Caution: It is also absorbed
through human skin readily.
· Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEi): ACEi have an
immediate effect on BP (several hours) and a long-term effect (2
weeks). Depending on the substance ACEi lowers systolic BP up to
15 to 20mm Hg (i.e., enalapril, benazepril, or imidapril) or as much
as 40mm Hg (ramipril). ACEi can be increased in dosage to further
optimize effect. They are well tolerated by cats. Enalapril, benazepril,
and imidapril are dosed at 0.5 mg/kg q12 to 24h PO. Ramipril is
dosed at 0.25 to 0.375mg/kg q24h PO.
· Amlodipine: This drug is a strong systemic and intrarenal vasodila-
tor with minimal effect on the heart due to a more peripheral than
central blockade of calcium channels (ratio 15:1). It protects the
heart and the kidney by decreasing systemic BP. It has a faster
onset and more effective decrease of BP. Within 24 hours it will
decrease BP up to 40mm Hg or more; its maximum effect is reached

outcome. It is well tolerated and dosed at 0.1 to 0.5mg/kg initially
(approximately 0.625mg/cat PO) then increased to 1.25mg/cat PO
 after 3 to 4 days if needed based on BP readings.
● For a hypertensive crisis that does not respond to the drugs already
discussed, use sodium nitroprusside at a dosage of 1 to 3 (up to 10)
μg/kg per minute administered in a constant rate infusion. It has
immediate onset with a plasma half-life of only a few minutes.
Alternatively, administer hydralazine at 2.5mg/cat q12h PO. It is 
effective after 1 to 2 hours and lasts for 12 hours.

Diagnostic Notes
● Serum T3 levels are of limited usefulness in the diagnosis of feline
HT because 25% of affected cats with elevated serum T4 levels
have normal serum T3 levels. Few, if any, hyperthyroid cats have
normal levels of T4 and elevated levels of T3.
● If fI4 is to be measured, the equilibrium dialysis and direct dialysis

P-mitrale or widened P-waves) and left ventricular enlargement (i.e.,
increased R-wave amplitude or increased QRS duration) are present.
Arrhythmias are frequent. Most cats with HCM will have a sinus
tachycardia. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias may be present.
Intraventricular conduction deficits, such as left anterior fascicular
block (i.e., bundle branch block), are occasionally present.
· Radiography: Variable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is seen.
Left atrial enlargement is often most prominent. Early in the course

of the disease, the cardiac silhouette may be normal because the left
ventricular wall thickening is directed inward. Cats with congestive
heart failure may demonstrate enlargement of the pulmonary veins,
variable pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion. See Figures 110-2,
294-11, 294-12, and 294-13.
● Echocardiography: Left ventricular hypertrophy involving the left
ventricular free wall and, usually to a greater degree, the interven-

is reportedly 6.5mm (normal 3.7 ± 0.7mm). Values of septal or left

Diagnosis
Primary Diagnostics
· History: A thorough dietary history should be assessed (chronic
protein malnutrition). A medication history should be obtained (i.e.,
NSAIDS). The owner should be questioned about color of the cat's
 stool (gastrointestinal [Gl] bleeding). Chronic vomiting and weight
loss may suggest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
· Physical Examination: Clinical signs of hypoalbuminemia include
peripheral edema (see Figure 112-1), ascites, and poor wound healing.
Cutaneous lesions sufficient to cause hypoalbuminemia (ie., a pro-
tein-losing dermatopathy [PLD]) would have to be significant. Small,
firm kidneys could suggest chronic renal disease (protein-losing
nephropathy [PLN]). The intestines should be palpated for evidence
of protein-losing enteropathy (PLE; normal to thickened intestines).
Stool color should be examined for evidence of melena (GI bleeding).
Hypoalbuminemia does not tend to cause pulmonary edema.

Idiopathic Ulcerative Dermatitis

Overview
Idiopathic ulcerative dermatitis is a rare feline dermatitis with an
 unknown cause and pathogenesis. Patients may present at any age,
breed, or sex. Most patients have a heavily crusted nonhealing ulcer
that has a surrounding border of thickened skin. This lesion may be
painful and occurs most commonly on the dorsal midline of the caudal
neck or between the scapulae. No systemic signs are usually noted.
A peripheral lymphadenopathy is possible. Infections, injections, foreign
bodies, and trauma do not appear to play a direct role. I have seen

Inflammatory Polyps and Masses
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
Respiratory polyps are masses composed of inflammatory cells that
contain or are covered with respiratory epithelium. Nasopharyngeal
 polyps occur in the oral cavity, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, Eustachian
tube, and tympanic bulla. They often arise in the tympanic bulla, extend 
down the Eustachian tube, and enter the nasopharynx. They can arise in
the nose and extend into the nasopharynx or out the nasal opening.
Inflammatory polyps can arise in the middle ear and extend through the
tympanic membrane (TM) into the external ear canal.
 Respiratory polyps are composed of granulation tissue, which may be
quite dense and mature or looser and more vascular. They usually have
insignificant numbers of eosinophils. They occur most commonly in
young cats; the mean age of diagnosis is 1.5 years. Consequently, they
are considered by some to be a congenital disease. However, they have
also been found in older cats and may be the consequence of chronic

respiratory epithelium. It is believed that their origin is different from
respiratory polyps. They are included in this chapter because of several
diagnostic and therapeutic features that they share with respiratory
polyps.

Treatment
Primary Therapeutics
· Oral Surgery: Oral masses should be biopsied and removed either
with excision or laser ablation. Initially, a nasopharyngeal mass
should be approached orally with rostral retraction of the soft palate.
Its point of attachment in the middle ear may be avulsed with
steady traction. Failure to remove all of the mass, a common problem,
will often result in regrowth. If it cannot be removed in this manner, 
the nasopharynx can be approached via an incision through the
midline of the soft palate. See Figure 121-2A and Chapter 262. Masses
adjacent to teeth are less likely to recur if those teeth are extracted
followed by the use of anti-inflammatory drugs.

middle ear, bulla osteotomy increases one's chances of removing the

CHAPTER 122
Intraocular Tumors
Karen R. Brantman and Harriet I. Davidson
Overview
Although intraocular masses are generally uncommon in the cat, both
neoplastic and nonneoplastic tumors can occur. An iris cyst (otherwise
refered to as a ciliary or uveal cyst) is a pigmented, translucent, non-
neoplastic proliferation of ciliary tissue. Cysts are round and smooth,
attaching most commonly to the posterior iris. Pigmentation may be
intense, making them difficult to distinguish from a solid mass.
Nonetheless, light from a bright transilluminator held close to the
eye should penetrate it. A single, simple cyst requires no therapy.
Intervention is considered only when the cyst obstructs the pupil,
hinders vision, disrupts aqueous flow, obstructs the irido-corneal angle,
or touches the corneal endothelium. Cyst removal is accomplished via
needle aspiration or laser ablation.
 An iris nevus or freckle is an excessive accumulation of melanin within
the iris and is considered non-neoplastic. The freckle itself and surround-
ing iris should be smooth, non-vascular, and regular in appearance. If
large areas of iris pigmentation or multifocal nevi are present, the condi-
tion is referred to as iris melanosis. Freckles and melanoses should be
 monitored closely throughout the cat's life for progression. When pig-

Conjunctivitis is considered the most common feline ocular condi-

developing both a diagnostic and treatment plan.
 Infectious Causes of Conjunctivitis and Keratitis
● Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1): This organism is extremely common
among the cat population, with greater than S0% of cats potentially
having latent infections. As a result, it is a leading cause of con-
junctivitis in cats of all ages. The virus is transmitted by inhalation
or direct contact, and kittens are often infected by the queen early
in life. FHV-1 infects epithelial cells of the conjunctiva, respiratory
tract, and occasionally the cornea and causes necrosis of these cells.
Initial clinical signs may be seen as conjunctivitis alone or in asso-

Laryngeal Disease

Overview
Laryngeal disease is relatively uncommon in cats. The presenting signs
associated with laryngeal disease are usually: (a) inspiratory dyspnea,

ing, and placing a stethoscope over the larynx and auscultating at this
site may help to localize the abnormality to the larynx; (b) dyspnea that
is not relieved by mouth-breathing (e.g., by occluding the nostrils during
clinical examination); (c) dysphonia or complete loss of voice, often with
aqedied (a) pue (guuanos 1o guupia gurgsea (p) (and o Aqeu1 ue
laryngeal abnormalities or clinical signs that may worsen on gentle
manipulation of the larynx.
 Because of the small size of the feline larynx, it is not uncommon for
cats with laryngeal disease to have profound dyspnea, and careful han-
dling to avoid severe distress may be required.
A variety of types of laryngeal disease have been reported in cats
including anatomical abnormalities, edema, and laryngeal cysts, but the

Overview
Mycobacteria are nonmotile, nonspore-forming, gram-positive, acid-
fast, aerobic bacilli. Noted for wide variations in host affinity and patho-
genicity, they are phagocytized by macrophages and grow intracellularly.
Cats are susceptible to a number of different mycobacterial infections
and several mycobacterial syndromes have been identified in cats,
not produce tubercles); infection caused by rapidly growing mycobacte-
ria (previously called "opportunistic" or "atypical" mycobacteria), and
feline leprosy syndrome. Cats with mycobacteriosis are usually pre-
sented for care because of nodular skin lesions or thickening of the sub-
cutaneous tissues; there may be associated ulceration or draining tracts.
Historically, feline leprosy has been attributed to infection with
Mycobacterium lepraemurium, the causative agent of rat leprosy. More
recently, it has been demonstrated that a number of different organisms
may be responsible for feline leprosy, and the disorder is now termed
feline leprosy syndrome.
M. lepraemurium infection causes a nodular-to-ulcerative granuloma-
tous skin disease of cats. Mice and guinea pigs are also susceptible to this
organism. It is thought to be transmitted to cats through fighting with or 
ingesting infected rodents. The disease is most prevalent in areas with a

Linear Foreign Body
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
A linear foreign body is a gastrointestinal (Gl) foreign body that is
linear in shape. It may lodge in the Gl tract due to its diameter or
 composition, or it may lodge because it exceeds the length of a peristaltic
wave (i.e. about 30cm [12in]). Most linear foreign bodies are string
sewing thread, ribbon, Easter basket grass, or Christmas tree tinsel.
Materials of this type often lacerate the intestinal wall, resulting in
bacterial peritonitis. Clinical signs include anorexia, retching, vomiting.

 small bowel to become bunched or accordion pleated. See Figure
128-2. Thick linear foreign bodies (e.g., shoe lace) cause obstruction
without the typical accordion pleating. See Figure 128-3. These may

Linear Foreign Body
Figure 128-5  Two enterotomy incisions were all that were needed to remove this
linear foreign body. The string was tied through the side ports in the catheter, and
the catheter and the string were extracted from the distal enterotomy site. Care should 
be taken not to spill barium into the peritoneal cavity because it is irritating: bile
peritonitis results.
Figure 128-3  A thick linear foreign body (heavy shoe lace) fills the small bowel
so the classic plications are not seen on a barium series.
However, a technique can be used in many cats that requires only
two enterotomy incisions. See Figure 128-5. A 12 French rubber cath-
eter is inserted into the bowel through the initial enterotomy incision,
which is made near the distal end of the foreign body. It is threaded
retrograde through the bowel to the proximal end of the foreign
body. A second enterotomy incision is made over the end of the

the bowel in the distal direction. Aggressive treatment of bacterial
peritonitis should be part of the surgical procedure.
· Peritonitis: Because many of these cats have bowel perforation,
antibiotics should be given before and after surgery. Aggressive
peritoneal flushing should occur prior to abdominal closure. See
Chapter 168.
Therapeutic Notes

this condition.

Primary Therapeutics
● Fenbendazole: Give 50mg/kg q24h PO for 5 days for capillariasis,
for 21 days for aelurostrongylosis, and for 14 days for paragonamia-

of choice for paragonamiasis. Treatment should be extended if subse-
quent fecal examinations remain positive for larvae or ova; however,
spontaneous remission can occur with both species of lungworms.

Secondary Therapeutics
● Radiation Therapy: This may be indicated in some cases, including
possibly nasal lymphoma and mediastinal lymphoma; however, it is
not clear if the addition of radiation therapy is superior to chemo-
therapy alone.
● Supportive Care: Fluids, nutritional supplementation, feeding tubes,
or other supportive measures may be needed depending on the loca-
tion and severity of the lymphoma and the cat's tolerance for
chemotherapy.
Therapeutic Notes
· Chemotherapy is generally well tolerated. Most cats experience self-
limiting side effects (i.e., anorexia, lethargy) at some point in the
protocol. Serious side effects are infrequent and include vomiting.

● Medicated Shampoos: Topical 2% ketoconazole, 2% miconazole, or

CHAPTER 132
Mammary Gland Neoplasia
Bradley R. Schmidt and Mitchell A. Crystal
Overview
Mammary gland neoplasia is the third most common neoplasia in the
cat, accounting for 17% of all neoplasms in the female cat. Mammary
tumors are rare in male cats. Mammary gland neoplasia occurs at an
average age of 10 to 12 years (12.8 years in male cats) but has a reported
age range of 9 months to 23 years. Siamese cats and domestic short
haired cats may be at an increased risk of developing mammary gland
neoplasia, and Siamese cats may acquire tumors at a slightly younger
age. Reports have shown that some mammary tumors contain proges-

ovariohysterectomy has a sparing effect on the incidence of malignant
(but not benign) mammary neoplasia. Cats spayed prior to 6 months of
age are 91% less likely to develop mammary carcinoma.
 Feline mammary tumors are malignant 80 to 93% of the time in con-

is the adenocarcinoma (i.e., tubular, papillary, or solid), which presents

Diagnosis
Primary Diagnostics
● Palpation: This is the test that usually finds the mass. Because 80
to 93% of mammary gland tumors are malignant, a mammary mass
in a cat must be taken seriously and approached aggressively.
Owners who wish to monitor growth over time need to be told
that metastasis may occur while the palpable mass is still small.

the lungs, pleura, or intrathoracic lymph nodes. See Figure 132-2.
Thoracic radiographs should be performed prior to anesthesia and
 surgery in all cats with mammary tumors. Three views are recom-
 mended (left and right laterals and a ventral-dorsal view).
· Abdominal Ultrasound: This should be performed to evaluate for
 evidence of metastasis and lymph node enlargement.
● Pleurocentesis and Cytology: This is indicated if pleural effusion is
 present. Cytologic evaluation of fluid collected may reveal evidence
of metastasis although some cats with intrathoracic neoplasia will
have effusion void of neoplastic cells.
● Fine-Needle Aspiration and Cytology: This may suggest whether a
tumor is malignant or benign, but histopathology is more accurate.

Manx Syndrome
Vanessa Pimentel de Faria
Overview
Manx is a breed with a naturally occurring mutation of the spine. Manx
cats that are homozygous for the mutation die before birth, and stillborn
kittens show gross abnormalities of the central nervous system. If there
is no overt problem with a Manx syndrome kitten at birth, the difficulties
will show up in the first few weeks or months of life. The syndrome is
extreme difficulty walking. Heterozygous Manx are affected to an equal
or lesser degree. The most visible effect is taillessness, which is a domi-
nate trait. That characteristic varies from having no coccygeal vertebrae
("rumpy"), several coccygeal vertebrae fused in an upright position
("rumpyraiser"), several coccygeal vertebrae, but deformed ("stumpy"),
au (Au, no pet,) e aadus Au n aaus e Aeu pue
rumpy form seems to have more spinal cord abnormalities in addition
to absent or rudimentary caudal vertebrae.
It is hypothesized that the problems associated with the taillessness
condition may be related to a disturbance of central nervous system
development during early embryonic life. The variable expression of

spinal nerves from the sacral cord segments, which supply innervation
to the colon, bladder, hindlimbs, and perineal regions. In addition, the 
pelvis may be malformed and fused, and the anal opening may be
narrow, causing constipation. However, some tailless cats have a normal
sacrum, spinal cord, and cauda equina. Spina bifida is the most com-
monly reported vertebral malformation in Manx cats, and urine and
fecal incontinence are often the earliest presenting signs. In some cases,
spina bifida (see Figure 134-1) is associated with meningocele (see

Mast Cell Tumors
Diagnostic Notes
● The histologic appearance of cutaneous MCT (mastocytic or his-
tiocytic) may help predict metastatic potential. The grading scale
used in the dog does not apply to feline MCT.
· A complete systemic evaluation (CBC, buffy coat preparation,
bone marrow aspiration, and abdominal or thoracic imaging)
will define the extent of the disease and assist in selection of the
most appropriate therapeutic approach. This should be per-
formed in all cases of visceral MCT and in cases of cutaneous
MCT associated with clinical signs or in cases that have multiple
cutaneous tumors.
● When performing fine-needle biopsies of splenic lesions, pre-
treatment with antihistamines may be indicated to reduce the
effects of degranulation.
● Mast cell granules occasionally do not stain well with quick-
staining methods. Leaving the slide in the fixative (first dip jar
in quick Wright's-type stains) for several minutes may help
improve mast cell granule staining. See Chapter 287.

● Surgical Excision: Complete removal is curative in most cases of
cutaneous MCT. Wide surgical margins should be attempted,
although margins are not as critical as in the canine because most
demonstrate a benign behavior. Wide margins are indicated for
the diffuse mastocytic form.

of 5 to 6 years of age. There is no breed or sex predilection, although one
source suggests males are predisposed. Obese, less-active cats may be at
an increased risk. Clinical signs of megacolon include chronic constipa-
tion or obstipation with poor responses to treatment with laxatives and
enemas. Cats may also demonstrate anorexia, lethargy, and vomiting.
Rarely, diarrhea is noted secondary to straining and mucosal irritation,
and owners may erroneously present these cats for diarrhea. Clinical
signs may be present for weeks to years. Physical examination reveals a
distended colon, usually with no other abnormal findings, although
dehydration is often present.
 The differential diagnosis for idiopathic megacolon should include

Meningioma, the most common primary brain tumor of cats, arises from

condition occurs when an untreated wound or an unsanitary damp
region, can predispose cats to infestation. Urine, feces, and vaginal
discharge can accumulate in these areas and harbor a scent that attracts
insects. Subsequent secondary bacterial pyoderma can work to further
promote fly strike. Geriatric long-haired cats are overrepresented as
debilitation can lead to a lack of grooming followed by hair matting
affected due to their inability to groom the perineal area. Often times,
cats in this condition suffer from neglect, usually based on ignorance
rather than malice on the part of the owner. An understanding of the
fly life cycle can aid a veterinarian suspecting abuse or neglect to
determine the duration of the problem.
 Once flies become attracted to an area, they lay hundreds of eggs that
hatch within 24 hours into first instar larvae. These larvae immediately
begin to migrate into the tissue and feed on surrounding liquefied mate-

begin to swarm together and migrate further. After another 24 hours
they molt into third instar larvae, their final larval stage. At this point 
the larvae grow, develop, and feed for approximately 48 hours before
they leave the feeding source to pupate.

CHAPTER 147
Nasal and Frontal Sinus Infection
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
Infections are common in the nasal cavity (rhinitis) and frontal sinuses
(sinusitis) of cats. These two structures communicate through an ostium
so infections that originate in the nasal cavity frequently ascend into
the frontal sinuses resulting in rhinosinusitis. Primary sinusitis is rare.
 There are three common categories of infection: bacterial, viral, and
fungal. All three are likely to be chronic and produce a nasal discharge.
Several theories are related to the pathophysiology of these disorders.
Some authorities feel that most disorders are idiopathic and due to a
self-perpetuating, chronic inflammatory disease much like inflammatory
bowel disease occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. Others feel that most
begin as a chronic infection with the feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) or the
feline calicivirus (FCV). The latter theory states that a chronic viral infec-
tion predisposes the cat to secondary bacterial or even fungal infections
because the viruses cause permanent damage to the turbinates. The
bacteria most commonly cultured include Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus.
 The role of Bartonella in chronic rhinitis is controversial. Many cats
with rhinitis, sinusitis, and rhinosinusitis test antibody positive for the
bacterium, but so do many asymptomatic cats. See Chapter 17. Most
fungal infections are due to Cryptococcus neoformans, but histoplasmosis
 may also affect the nasal cavities. Underlying immunosuppression due
to the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or the feline immunodeficiency virus
(FIV) has not been found to be a factor. The typical clinical signs are
recurrent episodes of sneezing and a chronic purulent nasal discharge.

empirical choice.

CHAPTER 148
Nasal Myiasis
Sarah M. Webb
Overview
The nasal bot fly (Oestrus oois), is an insect, the larvae of which occur
primarily in the nasal cavity of sheep and goats. In sheep, the adult fly
deposits first instar larvae around the nostrils, from where they crawl
into the nasal passages. First instar larvae persist for 2 weeks to 9 months
before migrating to the frontal sinuses. Finally, fully grown third instar
larvae leave the host and drop to the ground, where pupation occurs
before hatching into adult flies. Hooks and spines on the larvae cause
severe irritation and inflammation of the host mucosa with a marked
hypersensitivity reaction.
 This myiasis occurs worldwide and has been identified on several
occasions as an unusual parasite causing nasal myiasis in several other
species. For example, O. oois has been reported to cause severe naso-
pharyngeal irritation in humans. In affected individuals, there is an
acute onset of discomfort and a "foreign body sensation" with extreme
irritation of the throat, itching, and coughing followed by nasal, aural,
and ocular symptoms. Similar findings have been reported sporadically
in the dog, with sneezing as the most prominent clinical sign.
Affected cats present with a typical history of roaming with access to

and inflammation result in marked edema of the mucosa of the nasal
turbinates. This can result in near complete occlusion of air flow through
the nasal passages. Physical distress is obvious, although once the cat
learns to open mouth breathe, its dyspnea improves. Coughing may
subside after a few days. Other clinical signs may include vomiting and
depression with a poor appetite. Nasal discharge is not an obvious
feature of disease in the cat.
 The differential diagnosis includes acute feline viral upper respiratory
disease, neoplasia, nasal polyps, and foreign bodies causing upper
airway obstruction. Of these, usually only foreign bodies have a suffi-
ciently abrupt onset to really fit in with the clinical picture.

nasopharyngeal stenosis has a fair prognosis, with recurrence of the

stent placement, however, is good. Most cases of nasopharyngeal neo-
plasia have a poor prognosis, except for lymphoma, for which the prog-
nosis is fair to good. Infectious disorders of the nasopharynx have a
variable prognosis, depending on the causative agent and the immune 
status of the patient. Fungal rhinitis has a fair to good prognosis;
however, successful treatment may require months of continuous anti-
microbial therapy. Viral infections of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx
 tend to be chronic and persistent in cats regardless of therapy; however,
the prognosis for most cats is good.

CHAPTER 154
Oral Neoplasia
Bradley R. Schmidt and Mitchell A. Crystal
Overview
Oral neoplasia comprises 3% of all feline tumors. Of these, 60 to 80% are
squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 10 to 20% are fibrosarcomas (FSA).
Other oral tumors including odontogenic tumors (i.e., inductive fibro-
ameloblastoma, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, and epulides),
melanoma, lymphoma, and so on comprise less than 3% of all oral
tumors. Breed, coat color, or gender has not been associated with oral
tumor formation. Results of one study suggests the use of flea collars,
feeding a predominantly canned diet, feeding canned tuna fish, and
possibly exposure to household tobacco smoke are associated with an
increased risk of oral SCC development.
 Feline oral tumors may arise from any region of the mouth (i.e., man-
dible, maxilla, palate, and so on), but SCC appears to most commonly
 involves the sublingual site. See Figure 154-1. Tumors are more common
in older cats (i.e., average of 10-12 years for SCC and FSA), with the
exception for cats with inductive fibroameloblastoma in which cats are
generally young (18 months or younger,) and there is no definitive breed
or sex predilection. Oral tumors tend to be locally invasive and often
invade the underlying bone and extend to involve the nasal passages,

SECTION 1: Diseases and Conditions
Diagnostic Notes
● Educating the client regarding oral examinations and the importance
of regular veterinary visits is important for early detection of oral
tumors.
● Detection of loose teeth during oral examination or dental proce-
dures should prompt strong consideration for radiographs, CT or
 MRI, and biopsy.
● Blood tests may reveal an anemia of chronic disease, paraneoplastic
leukocytosis, and other medical conditions that may concurrently be
 present in older cats.
· Feline retroviruses have not been shown to be a risk factor for the
development of feline oral tumors but are important in assessing
the overall health of the patient. A retrovirus infection will degrade
the prognosis.

It is sensible to advise owners to administer NSAIDs after the cat has

CHAPTER 157
Otitis Externa
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
The external ear consists of the auricle, commonly known as the pinna,
that acts to collect sound and the external acoustic meatus, commonly
known as the external ear canal (EEC), which is a sound-conducting tube
that begins at the base of the pinna and terminates at the tympanic
membrane (TM). The pinna consists of the 0.5mm (1/32inch) thick
auricular cartilage covered by skin on each side. Numerous auricular
muscles attach to the auricular cartilage for movement of the pinna. The
EEC is L-shaped with a horizontal component and a vertical component.
Most diseases of the EEC involve the horizontal portion.
Otitis externa refers to any inflammatory disease of the pinna or the
EEC. Some underlying conditions are not intrinsically inflammatory but
may incite an inflammatory response. Lesions that obstruct the EEC
impair hearing, trap fluids, and prevent proper movement of air thus
creating a warm, dark, moist environment that is ideal for bacterial or
fungal growth.
 Diseases of the pinna include lacerations or abscesses (usually from
fighting; Chapter 21), tumors, and aural hematoma. Aural tumors are
usually squamous cell carcinoma (Chapter 203), mast celltumor (Chapter
Figure 157-1   An aural hematoma is a nonpainful, fluid-filled mass on the concave

side of the pinna. This one is so large that it nearly covers this side of the pinna.
 Diseases of the EEC include infections by bacteria or yeast, ear mites

16 and 82), contact irritants, inflammatory polyps (See Chapter 121),
and tumors. The most common tumors of the EEC are ceruminous

Suspicious for otitis externa. The discharge is often fetid. Dark exu-

and whether or not the TM is intact. This may require sedation in
some cats.
· Cytology: A modified Wright's stained smear can be used to classify
the infection as cocci Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., see

CHAPTER 158
Otitis Media and Interna
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
 Otitis media and otitis interna are defined as inflammation of the middle
membrane and air-filled tympanic cavity, the tympanic nerve (a branch
of the facial nerve), the opening to the Eustachian tube, and three audi-
tory ossicles (i.e., the malleus, stapes, and incus). Several nerves pass
through the middle ear, but only two are clinically relevant, the facial
nerve and the sympathetic trunk. Inner ear structures include the
cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular canals; these are housed within a
membranous labyrinth contained within a bony labyrinth.
Otitis media may be difficult to diagnose because it may be clinically
silent or overshadowed by concurrent otitis externa. Otitis media may
be a primary or secondary disease and may also occur iatrogenically. In
many cases, it develops secondary to extension of otitis externa through 
a ruptured tympanic membrane or by extension up the Eustachian tube
polyps, tumors, trauma, and bacterial infection. Many cases of otitis
interna have an associated otitis media; thus, the middle ear may serve
as the most common route of infection for the inner ear.
 Signs of otitis media include shaking the head or pawing at the ear
and, occasionally, a head tilt (caused by pain, not vestibular in origin).
When the facial nerve is involved, drooling, paralysis of the lip or ear,
diminished or absent palpebral reflexes, and widened palpebral fissures
may be seen. Sympathetic nerve involvement may produce Horner's
syndrome: enophthalmos, protrusion of the membrana nictitans, ptosis,

sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound over the last decade and insig-
nificant lesions, such as nodular hyperplasia, may be falsely taken as
evidence of pancreatitis, leading to a decreased specificity of this
diagnostic modality. Thus, caution is advised not to overinterpret
ultrasonographic findings.
Pancreatic Cytology: The pancreas can be ultrasonographically
localized in most feline patients with pancreatitis, and fine-needle
aspiration of the pancreas can be safely performed by an experi-
enced operator. The presence of pancreatic acinar cells and inflam-
matory cells in the same cytological preparation confirms a diagnosis
of pancreatitis. However, a lack of inflammatory cells does not
help to rule out a diagnosis of feline pancreatitis.
Secondary Diagnostics
· Serum fTLI Concentration: Like serum fPLI concentration, serum
fILI concentration is also a specific indicator of pancreatic function.

decreased contrast in the cranial abdomen, dilated and gas-filled
small intestinal loops, and transposition of abdominal organs (i.e.,
duodenum laterally and dorsally, the stomach to the left, and the
transverse colon caudally). However, these findings are rather soft

Diagnosis
Primary Diagnostics
· Clinical Signs: Clinical signs will vary widely depending on the loca.
tion of the primary malignancy and its associated PNS.
· CACS: Clinical signs frequently include reduced appetite, nausea,
 and weight loss, which can be severe and rapid.
● Pyrexia: Fever is caused by the production of various cytokines by
the tumor, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF).
● HHM: The best recognized cancers causing HHM in the cat are
lymphoma and various carcinomas. Neoplastic tissue secretes a
number of active compounds including parathyroid hormone-
related protein (PTHrP) and Vitamin D derivatives resulting in
hypercalcemia due to increased osteoclast activity in bone and
increased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Clinical signs often
include lethargy, weight loss, anorexia, polyuria /polydipsia, and
vomiting. See Chapter 103.

· Nutritional Support: This is frequently required. Placement of a
feeding tube (i.e., nasoesophageal, esophageal, gastric, or jejunal) is
often the only practical means of feeding the patient if they are not
voluntarily eating. Assisted feeding (with or without pharmacologic
appetite stimulants) can sometimes work, but careful attention to
actual intake of calories is essential. Patients should not be stressed
by force-feeding.

Patent Ductus Arteriosus
Larry P. Tilley
Overview
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is not as common in the feline as in the
canine; however, it is important because it is one of the few cardiovas-
cular anomalies that may be corrected surgically. In the fetus, the ductus
arteriosus allows shunting (right-to-left) of blood away from the pulmo-
nary vascular bed through the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta.
Following birth, the ductus arteriosus normally constricts and eventu-
ally closes in response to increases in local partial pressure of oxygen

right shunt occurs, which eventually causes severe left ventricular
volume overload and left-sided heart failure. Changes in the pulmonary
2
vascular resistance may cause reversal of the shunt, which results in
right-sided heart failure.
 The magnitude of left-to-right shunting is dependent on the luminal
diameter and resistance within the ductus and on the pulmonary vascu-
lar resistance. The clinical features of PDA depend on the direction and

impulse. In right-to-left shunts, a murmur usually is not present, the
femoral pulses are not bounding, and signs of right-sided (i.e., ascites
and jugular pulses or distention) or biventricular heart failure (i.e.,

CHAPTER 165
Pectus Excavatum
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
Pectus excavatum (PE), or "funnel chest," is a congenital deformity of
the sternum and costochondral cartilages that creates a dorsal-to-ventral
narrowing of portions of the thoracic cavity. The cause (or causes)
remains unknown, although genetics may be involved because multiple 
animals in a single litter may be affected. A breed or sex predisposition
has not been identified. Affected animals are often asymptomatic; others
will have abnormalities of both the cardiovascular and respiratory
systems soon after birth. Abnormal position of the heart in the thorax
may lead to a heart murmur and impaired venous return and makes
auscultation, electrocardiography, and echocardiography difficult.
Dyspnea is the most common clinical sign; hyperpnea, exercise intoler-
ance, and recurrent respiratory infections have been reported. Many
affected cats are asymptomatic.
Diagnosis
Primary Diagnostics
● Physical Examination: The sternal defect is usually palpable (see
Figure 165-1).
● Radiography: Lateral radiographs demonstrate decreased thoracic
volume and elevation of the sternum with varying degrees of
severity. See Figures 165-2 and 165-3A. The cardiac position is
usually abnormal, with the heart shifted to the left of midline on
a ventrodorsal or dorsoventral view. See Figure 165-3B.
Figure 165-1   A palpable concave defect of the caudal sternum is present in this cat 
with pectus excavatum.

the heart and not heart disease.
● Size of the heart is difficult to assess radiographically. True cardio-
megaly cannot always be distinguished from malposition of the
heart.
● Radiographs should be evaluated for concurrent abnormalities.
● The electrocardiogram will be difficult to interpret due to abnormal
cardiac position in the chest.
Treatment
Primary Therapeutics
● Medical Management: Young animals without significant deformity
(i.e., the chest is simply flattened) may occasionally develop near-
to perform gentle medial-to-lateral compression of the thorax to

facilitate the process of normalizing contour of the chest. Cats with
mild sternal deviation (see Figure 165-2) may be clinically normal
without any treatment.
· Surgical Management: Application of an external splint to the
ventral thorax is the most common technique used in correction
of PE. The splint is padded and shaped into the contour of the
ventral thorax. Several sutures are placed around the sternum and
secured to the splint. Periodic tightening of the sutures moves the
sternum into a more normal position. This technique offers the
advantage of minimal internal intervention, but it is less effective
on cats with closed growth plates. Cats that are symptomatic will
usually improve after external splinting. Older cats may have a
less compliant thorax and require more aggressive techniques (e.g.)
sternotomy with splinting).
Secondary Therapeutics
● Antibiotics: Some animals with PE are prone to recurring respiratory
(A)
 infections. These should be addressed with appropriate antimicrobial
therapy.
Therapeutic Notes
· Owners should be advised not to breed animals that have PE or
that have produced litters with PE. Animals with PE should be
neutered.

Perinephric pseudocysts (PNP) are formed by the accumulation of

been reported sporadically as a cause of apparent renomegaly and
abdominal distention in the cat. Because the cyst wall is not lined with
epithelium, the term pseudocyst is used. The PNP wall is thought to be
derived from the renal capsule. Usually the cysts are attached to the hilus
or the poles of the kidney. Fluid may accumulate in a subcapsular or
the accumulation of fluid between the renal capsule and renal paren-
chyma. Fluid usually has low protein content, low specific gravity, and
low cell count.
RKidney
 The pathogenesis of the perinephric fluid accumulation is not com-
pletely understood. Underlying renal parenchymal disease may be a
factor because chronic renal disease is often present in association with
pseudocysts, and
d progressive renal parenchymal contraction that
impairs venous or lymphatic drainage could result in transudation.
Typically fluid is a transudate of serum, although uriniferous pseudo-
extravasation of urine between the kidney and renal capsule because

Perirenal pseudocyst formation occurs primarily in older cats (the
majority are over 8 years of age) and more often in males. There is

no breed predisposition, although Persians, Siameses, domestic short-
hair breeds, and domestic long-hair breeds are more represented than
others. Even though Persians have PNP, it is a different clinical entity
from polycystic kidney disease (PKD). PKD is an inherited autosomal
dominant disease in which cats develop multiple, epithelial lined intra-
 renal cysts derived from proximal and distal tubular epithelium in
renal cortical and medullary parenchyma.
Affected cats usually are presented for nonpainful abdominal disten-
sion over weeks to months, although in many of them signs referable to
renal dysfunction, such as polydipsia, polyuria, anorexia, weight loss,
and vomiting, are evident. About 90% have at least mild chronic renal
disease at the time of diagnosis.

 The differential diagnoses include renal neoplasia, abscess, hematoma,
hydronephrosis, PKD, granulomatous interstitial nephritis due to feline
 infectious peritonitis (FIP), and pyelonephritis.

Secondary Diagnostics
● Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals a distended
abdomen with one or twolarge palpable masses. This is not a pathog-
nomonic for this disease.
● Abdominal Radiographs: These usually show a large mass with soft-
tissue radiopacity in the area normally occupied by the kidneys.
Diagnostic Notes
· Fine-Needle Aspiration or Biopsy: Differentiation between abscess,
hematoma, lymphoma, and PNP can usually be accomplished by
obtaining a fine-needle aspirate or biopsy of the lesion.
· A biopsy is associated with complications such as hemorrhage and
deterioration of renal function but should be considered if there is
evidence of renal neoplasia or a clinical suspicion that reversible
renal disease may be present.
· There is a high prevalence of urinary tract infection associated with
PNP so a urine culture should be submitted when the diagnosis is
made.
· Unilaterally affected cats have lower median serum creatinine

Treatment
Primary Therapeutics
● Capsulectomy: Resecting the cyst wall is the most common treat-
ment, although it probably does not stop transudate production but
may allow the transudate to be absorbed by the much larger surface
of the peritoneal cavity. See Figure 167-2. If the cyst wall is insuffi-
ciently removed, a new pseudocyst may form, necessitating dissec-
tion to the renal hilus. Because of the continued fluid production
from the cyst remnants after capsulectomy, ascites, and dehiscence
may occur. See Figure 167-3.
Secondary Therapeutics
● Drainage: Because of continual fluid production, needle drainage
provides only temporary relief to the patient, lasting from days to
months; it should be repeated as needed. This method may be prefer-
able for cats with moderate to severe chronic renal failure depending
upon the rapidity with which the PNP refills and the signs that the
cat suffers as a result.

· Omentalization: Using the omentum to enhance physiologic drain-
ing of the fluid has been reported and may be useful in minimizing
abdominal distention. The intrinsic ability of the omentum provides
ongoing physiological drainage of continued secretions, eliminates
dead space, and provides a source of neovascularization. See Figure
167-4.
Therapeutic Notes
· Renal biopsy of the contralateral kidney is useful for identify under-
lying parenchymal disease, but complications such as hemorrhage
and deterioration of renal function must be considered.
· Many cats with PNPs have concurrent chronic renal failure, and this

when irritating plants are ingested. Rinsing should be repeated after
the patient vomits.
· Decontamination (Emesis): If ingestion of the plant is within 4
hours and the cat is asymptomatic, or if the ingested plant is
known to cause systemic effects, emesis should be induced unless 
contraindicated (see Therapeutic Notes). For clients at home, emesis 
can be induced with ipecac syrup (2-6ml/cat PO). Hydrogen per-
oxide is highly irritating to tissues and can result in orogastric
mucosal ulceration. Under veterinary supervision, xylazine can be
used (0.4-0.5mg/kg IV), then reversed with yohimbine (0.1mg/
kg IV) after vomiting has occurred. Apomorphine is not recom-
mended for use in cats.
● Decontamination (Activated Charcoal): Give 2-5g/kg after induced
emesis is completed. Prepared liquid mixtures of activated charcoal
should be given according to the manufacturer's directions. For dry
weight activated charcoal, each gram should be mixed with 5mL of
water. Administration should be repeated every 3 to 6 hours there-
after. A minimum of several doses is recommended. In animals
Figure 170-24 Philodendron (Philodendron spp.); commonly encountered by cats.
without signs of respiratory compromise, orogastric tube administra-
tion is recommended for fast and reliable administration of activated
charcoal. (See Chapter 308).
● Laxatives: Laxatives should be given no sooner than 30 minutes after
administration of activated charcoal. Osmotic cathartics, such as
  ) s   
or lactulose (0.22 ml/kg PO), are generally effective.
· Fluid Therapy: If systemic signs develop, administer fluids IV.
Fluids should be administered as necessary during cathartic therapy.
Lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) should be avoided in cases of
cardiac toxicity, hepatic failure, or acute renal failure. Balanced
electrolyte solutions, such as LRS, are the fluid of choice for toxici-
ties primarily involving the gastrointestinal system.
· Arrhythmias: An electrocardiograph (ECG) should be performed
to monitor for arrhythmias; treat as appropriate. Lidocaine can be
given (1 mg/kg IV) as a bolus and repeated as needed for severe
ventricular arrhythmias. Cats tend to be more sensitive to the central
nervous system (CNS) effects of lidocaine; therefore, caution is
advised.

Treatment
Primary Therapeutics
· Immunosuppressive Therapy: The histologic pattern has caused
some to treat with immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone, gold 
salts, and chlorambucil.
● Doxycycline: One of the authors has had consistent success with
doxycycline (5mg/kg q12h PO for several weeks), based on a treat-
ment protocol published in the Veterinary Record (Bennenay S, &

cats develop chronic renal failure about 7 years of age. Clinical signs
include polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, inappetence, and lethargy.
 Bacterial infection of the cysts has been reported. This is a serious
 complication that mandates antibacterial therapy. Because the cysts do
not communicate with the tubules or pelvis, most cats have sterile urine.

· Antibiotics: Bacterial infection of cysts is a complicating factor in
some cats.
· Nephrectomy: This could be considered when unilateral disease
is present and when renal failure is not present. An excretory
urogram should be performed first to document function in the
other kidney. However, nephrectomy is not recommended in a
Persian cat, Persian-crossed cats, or long-haired cats in general
due to the genetic nature of the disease and the potential for late
onset disease. It is rarely a unilateral disease. Nephrectomy is also
indicated when infection in the cysts of one kidney are resistant
to antibiotic therapy.

Overview
Polydactylism, the condition of having extra digits, is common in domes-
tic cats; it has also occasionally been observed in exotic cat species. It is
unknown why this condition appears more commonly in cats as com-
pared to other mammalian species.
 Polydactylism is characterized as a dysostosis, or a morphological
abnormality affecting development of bones or parts of bones. The harm-

abnormalities. However, the less common form of polydactylism is asso-
 ciated with serious deformities, such as radial agenesis or hypoplasia
(the so-called "twisty cat").
 Normally, cats have 5 digits (including the medial digit, or dewclaw)
on the front feet and 4 digits on the hind feet. The dewclaw is shorter
there are one or more additional digits on the front feet, hind feet, or
both. Rarely, only the hind feet are affected. In most cases, the extra
digits are present on the medial aspect of the paw. Oftentimes, the extra
digit does not contain a full complement of bones. The presence of extra
digits on the medial aspect of the limb is called preaxial polydactylyy;
when present on the lateral aspect of the limb, it is called postaxial
polydactyly. Several cats have been reported to have upwards of 25
total digits.
 This condition likely arose as a genetic mutation and is passed down
as an autosomal dominant trait with variable expression (numbers of
toes). Cats with polydactylism sometimes have a similarly affected

 Polydactyl cats have been called "mitten cats," "thumb cats,” and
"Hemingway cats." The latter term refers to the polydactyl cats
owned by the writer Ernest Hemingway. He had a remarkable affec-
tion for these animals and many polydactyl cats still reside at

CHAPTER 179
Pulmonary Fibrosis
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a recently described chronic pro-
gressive interstitial lung disease of cats. Only a limited number of cases
have been described in the literature. Nevertheless, recognition of this
disorder in cats is highly significant in that it mimics the clinical course
hauo Aue un ueu Aiaso aiou yd uewnu jo saupuy oonoued pue
animal model studied to date.
 The exact cause of IPF in cats remains undetermined, though a genetic
basis is speculated. It represents a unique disorder in which the
pulmonary interstitium is progressively replaced with foci of fibroblasts

does not have a significant inflammatory component.
 Infectious causes of interstitial lung disease (e.g., toxoplasmosis and
histoplasmosis) are common and have been well described in cats. Other 
less common causes include toxic, chemotherapeutic (nitrosourea), and
environmental agents (e.g, paraquat and asbestos). IPF is diagnosed 
when all known ca uses of interstitial lung disease have been eliminated.
 No apparent breed or sex predisposition has been noted. Most affected
cats have been middle-aged or geriatric. Owners are often unaware of
(A)
the disease because middle-aged and older cats are normally sedentary
and can limitexertion even further when respiratory difficulty is present.
Most cats do not demonstrate distress until pulmonary gas exchange is
severely compromised; thus, recognition of respiratory abnormalities is
typically a recent historical finding. Tachypnea, inspiratory dyspnea,

expiratory component distinguishes IPF from asthma and bronchitis.
Diagnosis
 Primary Diagnostics
● Physical Examination: Tachypnea, inspiratory (or mixed inspiratory
and expiratory) distress, and cough have been reported. Crackles and
wheezes are common on lung auscultation.
· Thoracic Radiography: Parenchymal disease varies in type, location,
and severity with IPF. Abnormalities in cases studied to date have
been described as "pronounced" to "severe." Interstitial, alveolar,
and bronchiolar patterns (alone or in combination) are present with 
a patchy or diffuse distribution. See Figures 179-1 and 179-2.
● Lung Biopsy and Histopathology: Definitive diagnosis of IPF
requires lung biopsy. Fibrous changes in the lung cannot be reliably
detected with cytology, regardless of how the sample is obtained
(i.e., aspiration or airway washings).

may be beneficial in ruling out infectious, parasitic, or neoplastic
 processes. See Diagnostic Notes for risks.
● Heartworm Serology: Heartworm disease is a more common cause
of feline cough than IPF and should be investigated in endemic areas.
Heartworm disease may cause chronic lung disease with similar
radiographic findings. See Chapter 88.
Diagnostic Notes
· A number of cats with confirmed IPF died during or after airway
 lavage. Lack of normal airway compliance and the attendant compli-
procedure for cats with IPF.
· Concurrent pulmonary neoplasia has been found in a number of cats
studied. A well-described association between IPF and pulmonary
carcinoma exists in humans and animals.
(A)
Treatment
Primary Therapeutics
● Corticosteroids: Immune-suppressive doses of glucocorticoids may
 be administered but improvement seldom occurs.
● Bronchodilators: Bronchodilator therapy may be included in the
treatment plan, but most affected cats have not shown a response to
these drugs.
Therapeutic Notes
● Cytotoxic Therapy: Cyclophosphamide was utilized in one reported
case, and the cat survived for at least 4 years. The cat received concur-
rent corticosteroids.
Prognosis
Because of the progressive nature of IPF, the prognosis is grave. Most
 cats survive only days to months following diagnosis.

Pulmonic Stenosis
Larry P. Tilley
Overview
Congenital obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract is less
common in the cat than in the dog. Isolated pulmonic stenosis (PS) has
been reported infrequently in the cat, with only 3% of congenital heart
defects in one study. Right ventricular outflow obstruction secondary to
valvular or infundibular stenosis causes right ventricular pressure over-
examination findings suggestive of pulmonic stenosis include a left

sometimes evidence of right-sided heart failure such as ascites. Affected

by the owner, or a diagnosis of lower urinary tract disease is made based
on hematuria, dysuria, pollakiuria, and bacturia. Many cats showing
nonspecific signs of infection are treated empirically with antibiotics
without a definitive diagnosis and subsequently improve. Evidence of
the disease may be found years later following the onset of chronic renal

· Chemistry Profile: Typical findings during active infection include
azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, nonregenerative anemia, and meta-

of their nephrons functioning will have normal renal values; this is
not unusal.
● Urinalysis: Typical findings during active infection are low specific
 gravity proteinuria, bacturia, pyuria, and hematuria. Leukocyte

of bacteria and to provide data on which to base antibiotic
selection.

CHAPTER 183
Pyothorax
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
H
Pyothorax is an accumulation of pus within the pleural cavity. It is almost
always caused by a bacterial infection; Pasturella multocida and Bacteroides
 spp. are common isolates. Anaerobic organisms are often found, and
fungi may also be causative. Traditionally the causative organism has
been thought to gain entry into the pleural space through penetrating
bite wounds from other cats, but foreign bodies, such as migrating plant
awns, have rarely been found within the pleural space and presumed to
be causative. In addition, it is thought that infections may arise from 
abscesses in adjacent organs, including the trachea and esophagus, or
 may develop from hematogenous spread. A recent study shows a strong
link to oropharyngeal bacteria that may descend the respiratory tract,
penetrate the lung parenchyma via abscessation, and enter the pleural
space. However, in most cases, the source of the infection is not defini-
tively identified. Presence of the organisms and their toxins leads to the 
systemic effects of fever, inappetence, weight loss, and dehydration.
Pulmonary compression results in dyspnea and tachypnea. As with most
cases of dyspnea, the owner usually reports an acute onset, even though
 the disease typically has been present for days to weeks.
(A)
Diagnosis
Primary Diagnostics
· Clinical Signs: Clinical signs include dyspnea and tachypnea; some
cats may have systemic signs of illness.
· Auscultation: Heart sounds are muffled; lung sounds are decreased
ventrally and increased dorsally.
● Radiography: Pleural effusion with pleural fissures and scalloped
lung borders are typical. See Figure 183-1.
● Thoracentesis: A few milliliters of fluid may be removed to confirm
 the presence of pleural effusion and for subsequent analysis.

ated cell count is greater than 15 × 10′/L (15,000 × 10°/mm"), often
greater than 50,000 × 10°/L (50,000 × 10°/mm), and may reach
100,000 × 10°/L (100,000 × 10 / mm²).
● Pleural Fluid Cytology: Degenerative neutrophils, macrophages,
and the causative organism are usually found. Nondegenerate neu-
trophils may predominate when higher bacteria, such as Actinomyces
or Nocardia, are involved. See Figure 183-2.
· Culture and Sensitivity of Pleural Fluid: Aerobic and anaerobic cul-
tures are essential as many of the pathogens are anaerobic. Some

CHAPTER 187
Rectal Disease
Heloisa Justen Moreira de Souza
Overview
The most common rectal diseases in cats include perineal hernia,
rectal prolapse, rectal stricture, rectal tumors, rectal perforation, and
rectovaginal fistulae.
Perineal Hernia
Overview
 Perineal hernias are related to weakness of the pelvic diaphragm mus-
culature and failure to support the rectal wall. This results in persistent
distention and outpouching of the rectum and impaired defecation. The
pue snusaual (st-1 auen) sieak 6 sl suais jo yasuo jo ae ueipau
constipation are the most common clinical signs. In cats with perineal
hernias visible perineal swelling occurs less often than in dogs. Cats with
megacolon and perineal herniation have hard stool filling the entire
colon and rectum. Perineal hernias are usually bilateral, and many are
associated with predisposing conditions that cause persistent straining,

Perineal hernia with bladder retroflexion is a rare condition and may
occur following a pelvic fracture resulting in stenosis of the pelvic canal
and chronic constipation.
Rectal Prolapse
Overview
Rectal prolapse is defined as eversion or prolapse of the rectum through
the anal opening caused by persistent straining beca use of urogenital or
intestinal disease. It may be complete (entire rectum and may include
part of the anus as well) or partial (protrusion of the rectal mucosa). The
complete prolapse mass is cylindrical, with a depression seen in the end.
The most common cause is severe enteritis or proctitis due to endopara-
sites, most often affecting kittens. Additional causes include foreign
bodies, neoplasia of the rectum or distal colon, dystocia, urolithiasis, or
sequelae of perineal urethrostomy. See Figure 187-1. Manx cats with
neurologic dysfunction of the anorectum are predisposed to this disease.

longstanding cases of rectal prolapse, the tissues may be ulcerated and

rectovaginal fistula exhibit abdominal enlargement and discomfort,
bulging of the perineum, lack of anal opening, passage of fluid feces
through the vagina and impaction, irritation of the vulva, tenesmus, and
inappetence. See Figure 187-4. Signs are usually noted after weaning.
Rectal Perforation
Overview
 Rectal perforation may be associated with administration of enemas
or manual extraction of impacted feces in cats and bite wounds. See
Figure 187-5. It is easy to perforate the rectal wall with even a rubber
 abscessation, and endotoxic shock may occur.

Rectal Stricture
· A rectal pull-through procedure is recommended for treatment of
rectal strictures. Simple circular strictures may respond to bouginage,
but it may be necessary to repeat this procedure several times.
Rectal strictures also can be successfully dilated using balloon dila-
tation techniques. Balloons with a diameter of 10 to 15mm are used
for cats. Four to six dilatation procedures may be required to achieve
functional sulccess.
Rectal Tumors
● For cats with rectal lymphoma, treatment with standard chemother-
apy protocols is initiated unless a mass is obstructing the rectum and
debulking is necessary. A rectal pull-through procedure is recom-
mended for treatment of rectal carcinoma. The primary indication for 
performing a rectal pull-through is to resect a distal colonic or
midrectal lesion not approachable through the abdomen and too

 The sclera is white and fibrous in nature but frequently not visible on
fundic examination. It can be seen in color-dilute cats that have little
 pigment in the RPE cells or choroid; this gives the eye a white or creamy
yellow appearance.
The vitreous humor fills the posterior segment of the eye, resting
directly on the retina. It is composed of water, collagen, cells, and hyal-
uronic acid. By maintaining its normal volume and consistency, the
space-occupying nature of the vitreous holds the retina in place against
the choroid. Changes to the vitreous resulting from age-related degen-
eration, chorioretinal inflammation, or hemorrhage, can make the fundus

disease. They have indistinct borders and typically present as gray to
white in color due to accumulation of vascular products or cellular infil-
trates in or beneath the retina. Hemorrhage appears bright red in color
with irregular margins. The retina becomes raised, resulting in bullous
detachment and potential blindness. Blood vessels may be large, tortu-
ous, and blood filled. Perivascular cuffing results if serum leaks from the
vessels. The optic nerve head may be swollen, irregular, or puffy.
 Inactive retinal lesions are areas where previous inflammation,
detachment, toxicity, or degeneration occurred. Inactive lesions are
 clear, flat, and well demarcated. Damaged areas in the tapetal fundus
are hyperreflective due to loss of retinal tissue over the tapetum
lucidum, whereas in the nontapetal fundus, lesions lack pigment or
contain clumps of pigment. Blood vessels are thin, pale, or absent, and
those overlying previously detached areas of retina will not contain
 blood. Previous hemorrhage may be dark in color with distinct edges.

is an essential amino acid in cats. It must be supplemented by diet; cats
cannot synthesize it endogenously. Insufficient nutritional taurine
results in retinal degeneration. Initially, the cat may have no evidence of
vision abnormalities; clinical lesions may be discovered during ophthal-
mic examination for unrelated reasons. The classic ophthalmoscopic
lesion is initially seen as a central, oval, or cigar-shaped hyperreflective 
area with poorly demarcated margins. If taurine is supplemented at this
stage, the hyperreflective area will remain but become well demarcated.
If the deficiency continues, the lesion will progress and result in a com-
pletely avascular, hyperreflective fundus. These severe cases result in
blindness. This condition is no longer common in the United States due
to current feline diet formulations.
 Toxins or drug overdose may also result in retinal degeneration. The
most common drug toxicity is enrofloxacin, which can cause permanent
blindness. Retinal toxicity is acute, occurring as early as 2 to 3 days after
initiating antibiotic therapy. The first sign of toxicity is often mydriasis.

Diagnosis
Primary Diagnostics
· Cytology: Fine-needle aspirates are of limited value in the diagnosis
of sarcomas because these tumors usually do not exfoliate well.
Although cytology is not acurate at differentiating sarcoma types, it
should give an indication that it is a sarcoma and help rule out other
types of neoplasia.
· Histopathology: Incisional biopsies will usually give a definitive
diagnosis of the type of sarcoma, which will aid with further surgical
or therapeutic planning. Although biopsies of sarcomas do not
increase the risk of metastasis, local seeding of neoplastic cells may
(A)
occur. It is important that the biopsy be performed in such a way as
to allow for complete excision of the biopsy site at a later date.
· Radiographs: If the primary tumor is overlying bone radiographs are
important to assess the degree of bony involvement.
Secondary Diagnostics
● Tumor Staging: Staging typically involves three-view thoracic radio-
graphs, cytology of regional lymph nodes (if possible), and abdomi-
nal ultrasound. This will help to determine the therapeutic options
and prognosis.
· Minimum Database: Complete blood count, serum biochemistry,
urinalysis, T4 assay and retroviral tests are important to look for
paraneoplastic syndromes and concurrent diseases, which may affect
surgical planning, anesthetic planning, the patient's ability to deal
with chemotherapy, and long-term prognosis.
● Advanced Imaging: Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic
 resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to determine the extent of the
tumor to plan for surgery or radiation therapy.
Diagnostic Notes
· Cytological findings from sarcomas should be interpreted with
 caution because they may vary from the histological diagnosis.
· Aspiration of bone marrow, liver, and spleen may be considered as
 part of the staging of malignant histiocytosis.

CHAPTER 199
Scottish Fold Osteochondrodysplasia
Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
The Scotish Fold is an affectionate breed known for its gentle disposi-
tion, rounded face and eyes, and folded ears. The trait for folded ears
has been perpetuated from a naturally occurring mutation first seen in
a Scottish barn cat in the 1960s; hence the name "Scottish Fold." The
breed was accepted for registry in England in 1966, but pedigree status
was rescinded in 1974 after discovery of a heritable cartilage defect in
the breed. Scottish Folds are still not accepted for registry in the United
Kingdom, although it is recognized as a pedigreed cat by the Cat
Fancier's Association in North America. The long-haired version of the
Scottish Fold is called the Highland Fold. When Scottish Fold cats are
mated with Scottish-Fold type cats with straight ears, the offspring are
called Scottish Shorthairs.
Kittens are born with straight ears and at about 1 month of age, the
ears will fold in some, but not all, of the kittens. Folded ears are caused
by a cartilage defect which is transmitted as an autosomal dominant 
trait. Recent work has described the inheritance pattern as incompletely
dominant rather than simple dominant. The folded-ear allele is desig-
nated as Fd. Folded-ear cats bred to other folded-ear cats are Fd /Fd;
(A)
heterozygotes are Fd/fd.
Unfortunately, the cartilage abnormality of the ears is linked to
a progressive, crippling arthropathy, Scottish Fold Osteochondro-
dysplasia (SFOCD). When foldedear cats are mated to other folded-ear
cats, this arthropathy invariably results. Affected cats have shortened
 malformed legs and abnormalities of growth plates. Cats heterozygous
for the folded gene (folded ear X straight ear mating) may develop
arthritis, but it is at an older age than cats which are homozygous.
Cats afflicted with SFOCD are painful in one or more limbs and reluc-
tant to jump from heights. Their gait is stiff and stilted because their
joints are unable to bear the weight of their fairly robust frame. Their
distal extremities (the feet in particular) are shorter than expected and
often misshapen, giving them a somewhat squat appearance. The tail is
short, has a thickened base, and is variably rigid and inflexible. It is not
uncommon for affected cats to present for lameness at a few weeks to
months of age; the severity of signs worsens with age as mechanical
stress on the bones and joints takes a toll.
Diagnosis
 Primary Diagnostics
● Diagnostic Imaging: Radiographs provide the basis for diagnosis of
 SFOCD. Lesions are bilaterally symmetric and may be present as
early as 7 weeks of age. There is irregularity in the size and shape of

seizure was single or multiple (cluster), and possible precipitating
events. Characteristics of the preictal and postictal period may be
important in predicting future seizures or confirming that the episode
was truly a seizure.
● Physical Examination: A complete neurologic examination should
be performed but not immediately after a seizure; the patient
should first be fully recovered from a recent seizure. Cranial nerve
deficits, proprioceptive deficits, lateralizing signs, and vision distur-
bances are just a few of the abnormalities that may help pinpoint the
underlying cause. The head should be evaluated for signs of trauma

examination is essential to identify retinal lesions that might indicate
infectious or inflammatory disease, hypertension, or lymphoma. A
normal neurologic examination does not rule out structural brain
disease.

· Radiography: Skull radiographs do not provide meaningful infor-
mation except with trauma and in rare cases of hydrocephalus. See
Figure 200-1. Thoracic radiographs are helpful in screening for sys

· Serum Bile Acids: Fasting and postprandial serum bile acids
are useful in identifying portosystemic shunts. See Chapter 178.
Determination of bile acids may be especially appropriate for kittens
and young adult cats with a history of seizures.
● Blood Pressure Determination: This is useful to screen for hyperten-

CHAPTER 201
Skin Parasites
Christine A. Rees
Overview
Skin parasites or ectoparasites are a common cause for feline dermato-
logic problems. Various skin parasites exist in cats. The most common
ectoparasites in cats that cause dermatologic problems are mites and
fleas. Different types of mites that commonly affect cats include: Demdex
spp., Cheyletiella spp., Ntoedres spp., and Otdetes spp.Each one of thee
parasites has a different treatment. Therefore, each one of these skin
 parasites will be addressed individ ually.
Demodicosis
Overview
Three distinct demodectic mites exist in the cat: Demodex gatoi, Demoder
 cati, and a "long" as yet unnamed Demodex spp. mite. Anecdotal reports 
suggest that D. gatoi is more commonly diagnosed in the United States
than the other two species. The diagnosis of this mite appears to be a
(A)
regional phenomenon because this mite is rarely reported in some areas 
of the country.
 The clinical presentation and possible underlying medical conditions
associated with the presence of the mites varies between the three demo-
on the body. This mite causes pruritus and is highly contagious among
cats. One report suggests that D. gatoi may also be associated with a
concurrent food allergy. Therefore, food allergy should be considered
when D. gatoi mites are present. See Figure 201-1.
 In contrast to D. gatoi, D. cati are found most commonly on specific
body locations, notably the face, eyelids, and ears. This mite causes
patchy alopecia with or without scale. A ceruminous otitis may also be
present. D. cati is most commonly associated with an underlying meta-
bolic or systemic disease, typically diabetes meltus, feline leukemia
virus infection (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection, or
other causes of immunosuppression. Therefore, appropriate blood tests 
need to be included in the diagnostics when D. cati is found.
 The clinical presentation for the long unnamed Demodex spp.is poorly

Prognosis
 The prognosis varies according to the species involved. The prognosis
is good for D. gatoi if all cats in the household are treated. The prognosis 
for D. cati will vary according to the underlying cause that is present.
 The prognosis for the long unnamed Demodex spp. is unknown.
Cheyletiellosis
Overview
Cheyletiella blakei is a feline ectoparasite that grossly appears as dandruff
or scale. Close inspection with magnification reveals the mite to move
thus creating the name "walking dandruff."
 The most common clinical signs are the appearance of excessive dan-
druff or scale on the trunk with pruritus. However, asymptomatic car-
riers have also been reported.
 C. blakei is highly contagious between cats and is zoonotic. Eggs are

tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure has been shown as a possible contributing
factor in oral SCC; ETS has not been evaluated in cutaneous SCC. The
mean age of cats with cutaneous SCC is 9 to 12 years. Common sites for
tumor development are the nasal planum (80-90% of affected cats; see
Figure 203-2), pinna (50% of affected cats; see Figure 203-3), eyelids (20%
of affected cats; see Figure 203-3), and lips. Tumors generally appear as
a proliferative or ulcerative, plaque-like or cauliflower-like lesion, with
or without overlying crusts. Lesions are sometimes mistaken as nonheal-
ing wounds. About one-third of affected cats have multiple facial lesions.
Cutaneous SCC is locally invasive but rarely metastasizes; however,

The prognosis is generally unrelated to the location of the tumor,
although tumors of the pinna often allow a more aggressive therapy and
thus may be associated with a better outcome. Histological grade appears 
to be prognostic; 50% of cats with poorly differentiated tumors are likely
to be euthanized within 12 weeks.

Stud Tail
Christine A. Rees
Overview
Feline stud tail is due to hyperplasia of the supracaudal tail gland;
this results in an accumulation of greasy material in the hair covering
parts of the tail. This condition is seen mostly in intact males but can
be seen in females and neutered males. A higher incidence has been
reported in cage confined cattery cats or in cats with poor grooming
habits. The greasy band-like strip occurs on the dorsum of the tail
(proximal one-half to one-third). This can lead to the collection of dirt
on the tail or matting in this area. When secondary infection occurs,
the area can become painful. However, stud tail is most commonly
considered a cosmetic problem.
Diagnosis

sphincter is retained. Function of the pudendal nerve can be deter-
mined through evaluation of anal tone and sensation to the perineum
and genitalia.
● Pelvic Nerve: The pelvic nerve originates in the sacral spinal cord at
 S1 to S3 and supplies parasympathetic motor and sensory innerva-
tion to the bladder, rectum, and genitalia. This nerve is vital for the
detrusor reflex of the bladder and for maintaining normal resting
tone of the colon and rectum to aid in fecal propulsion during defeca-
tion. Pelvic nerve damage results in uncoordinated, ineffectual
attempts at urination and overflow incontinence. Feces may accumu-
late in the colon. Function may be checked by observing the cat
urinate and determining the amount of residual urine. Normal urine
volume should be less than 2mL after micturition.

Tetanus, an uncommon bacterial disease of cats and dogs, is caused

 of tetanus. The organism is ubiquitous in the environment and part 
of the normal intestinal flora of humans and mammals. Clinical disease 
occurs when bacterial spores are traumatically introduced into tissues
with low oxygen tension and subsequently convert to a vegetative,
toxin-producing form. Elaborated toxins cause tissue necrosis and a
local environment favorable to further bacterial growth and toxin
elaboration. Tetanospasmin toxin gains entry to nerves at neuromus-

Toxin may remain at the level of the spinal cord or ascend the cord
bilaterally to the brain; hematogenous spread affects distant neuro-
 muscular junctions or can enter the brain via the ventricles. Binding
of toxin is irreversible and recovery depends entirely on growth of
new axonal terminals, a process requiring approximately 3 weeks.

· Diet Change: Affected cats should be placed on a balanced feline
diet.
Therapeutic Notes
● If dextrose is given to a cat with thiamine deficiency, it will be utilized
quickly and undergo abnormal metabolism, leading to lactic acid
buildup. If thiamine deficiency is a possibility, 25mg of thiamine
 should be given IM prior to dextrose administration.
· Cats that recover but refuse to eat any other diet than the thiamine-
deficient one can be supplemented with 30 to 50mg/cat q24h of oral
thiamine to prevent recurrence.
Prognosis
 The prognosis for thiamine-deficient cats is excellent if proper treatment
is rendered and the cat's diet is changed to one with adequate thiamine.

CHAPTER 211
Third Eyelid Diseases
Gwen H. Sila and Harriet I. Davidson
Overview
 The third eyelid, also referred to as the nictitating membrane, is located
in the medial and ventral aspect of the orbit rostral to the globe. It is
covered by conjunctival tissue, which lines the inside of the eyelids.
Within the center of the third eyelid is a T-shaped cartilage, which pro-
vides stability. At the base underneath the cartilage is a serous lacrimal
gland, which provides approximately 33% of the tear film. The third
eyelid moves across the surface of the eye by passive movement.
Contraction of the retractor bulbi muscle pulls the globe deeper into the
 orbit, which results in the third eyelid moving up and across the eye. In
the cat there is a small portion of smooth muscle, which is innervated
by sympathetic nerves, within the third eyelid. This muscle is extremely
small and plays no significant role in its movement. The function of the
third eyelid is to protect the cornea from external damage and help
spread the tear film evenly. Problems that affect the conjunctiva may also
affect the third eyelid. See Chapter 124.
Elevation of the third eyelid is the most common symptom prompting
consultation for a third eyelid abnormality. There are multiple possible
causes that need to be considered. Haws is a lay term used to describe a

hymoma
Bradley R. Schmidt
Overview
Thymoma is an epithelial tumor of the thymus infiltrated with benign,
mature lymphocytes arising from the cranial mediastinum. Different
histological cell types may be seen, but there appears to be no prognostic
differenced between these cell types. In cats, 60% of thymomas are cystic,
and squamous cell carcinoma has also been rarely documented to arise
within feline thymomas. Features of benign or malignant characteristics
are related to the pattern of growth of the tumor and not based on histol-
ogy. Benign tumors are well encapsulated and are easily amendable to
surgical resection. See Figure 2131. Malignant thymomas are invasive
and may be difficult to remove but do not necessarily metastasize.
Metastasis within the thoracic and abdominal cavity has been reported
to occur in 20% or less of reported cases. The median age of cats with
thymoma is reported to be 9.5 years of age. Domestic short-hair cats and

loxoplasmos1s
Gary D. Norsworthy and Sharon Fooshee Grace
Overview
 Yoxoplasma gondii is a protozoal organism that infects most warm-
blooded animals, but domestic and wild Felidae are the only hosts in
which the entire life cycle can be completed (i.e., are definitive hosts).
Approximately 30% of cats and up to 50% of humans in the United States
have been infected with the organism, although few of either species
have clinical disease. There are three infectious forms of the parasite: (a)
AImos (a) 'sanss Apoq ui aall yium 'saozauen Suendau Aipidel
replicating bradyzoites, which reside in tissue cysts, and (c) unsporu-
lated oocysts, which are excreted in feces. Some cats become infected
through ingestion of sporulated oocysts. However, most cats become
infected when they ingest bradyzoites, which are encysted in the tissues
of an intermediate host, such as a rodent. These tissue cysts are digested,
releasing bradyzoites, which penetrate the small intestinal wall. The
asexual phase of development is followed by a sexual phase, finally
 producing unsporulated oocysts. These unsporulated oocysts pass in the
feces but are not infective until they are exposed to oxygen and sporulate
in 1 to 5 days. The entire life cycle can be completed within 3 days after
ingestion of tissue cysts. If the life cycle begins with the ingestion of
tachyzoites or oocysts, it requires about 3 weeks for completion.

inspiratory) because most clinically significant conditions will cause
obstruction to the flow of air. However, coughing, stridor, and other
signs, such as gagging and dysphagia, may also be present depending
on the disease process. If the disease affects the intrathoracic trachea,
expiratory rather than inspiratory dyspnea may be seen.
Infectious Causes
Overview
Infectious tracheitis may occur in cats, usually as part of the acute upper
respiratory tract disease complex, with agents such as feline herpesvi-
respiratory (ie., nasal, ocular, and nasopharyngeal signs) predominate
with tracheal inflammation often being a minor component.
Rarely, tracheitis may be severe, and it may contribute significantly to
the disease presentation. Occasional cases have been seen with severe
tracheal infammation or edema that has caused significant respiratory
compromise.
Tracheal Foreign Bodies
(A)
Overview
Foreign bodies are more likely to lodge in the trachea in cats due to
the relatively small size of the airways, but smaller foreign bodies,
such as grass seeds, may pass lower down the respiratory tract. See
Figure 2i5-1. Respiratory noise, dyspnea, and coughing are the main
features seen with tracheo-bronchial foreign bodies. The signs are typi-

is most commonly affected with pressure necrosis occurring rather

All these conditions result in narrowing of the tracheal lumen, although
this may be a dynamic event with tracheal collapse.

the altered airway dynamics (e.g., rostral tracheal, laryngeal, or nasopha-

occur as a hypersensitivity reaction.
True tracheal collapse is extremely uncommon but has been described
as a result of congenital malformation. It may also be an acquired condi-
tion, such as secondary to tracheal trauma or secondary to severe
obstructive upper respiratory disease. The cough associated with nar-

SECTION 1: Diseases and Conditions
If a gastric or intestinal obstruction occurs, an underlying Gl
problem should be considered. When the surgery is performed to
remove the hairball, submit stomach and intestinal tissue for
histopathology.
Treatment
Primary Therapeutics
· Grooming: Frequent, even daily, brushing or combing may be
needed to prevent ingestion of excessive hair.
● Petroleum-Based Laxatives: These should be administered orally to
 provide lubrication and facilitate normal aboral passage. Several
preparations are commercially available. Most are in the form of a
flavored paste. Tastes vary between products so a cat's rejection of
one product does not mean it will reject another. Doses vary but

generally are suggested at 1 to 5mL/cat per day to effect. Overdosing
may ca use diarrhea although this is unlikely.
Secondary Therapeutics
● Motility Enhancers: Cisapride (2.5-7.5mg/cat q8-24h PO) or meto-
dopramide (0.2-0.5mg/kg q6-12h PO) may provide support for
those cats with motility disorders.
· Shaving: Long-haired cats can be shaved every 2 to 4 months to
minimize hair ingestion.
Prognosis
 Cats without underlying disease are at minimal risk of becoming ill and
trichobezoars mainly only create an inconvenience to the owner. Most
 of these cats can be controlled with therapy, although occasional epi-
sodes can be expected. The prognosis of cats with underlying disease

degree of obstruction and the duration of the obstruction. Return of renal
function is excellent after several days of obstruction; about 90% of GFR
will return after 2 days. It is good after several weeks of obstruction;
approximately 50% of GFR returns after 2 weeks. After 1 month of
obstruction little or no return of renal function is expected.
 For cats that are alive after 1 month, the long-term survival is excellent
with a 2-year survival rate of approximately 80%. However, recurrence
of ureteral obstruction is high with about 40% of cats experiencing a
repeated obstructive episode after a median time of 12 months.

CHAPTER 220
Urethral Obstruction
Rhett Marshall
Overview
Urethral obstruction in cats is a common and serious urologic emergency
that is fatal if urine flow is not restored within 24 to 48 hours. Immediate
therapy is required to correct fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base derange-
ments while simultaneously re-establishing urethral patency.
Urethral obstruction causes increased intravesicular pressure that is
transmitted "upstream" to the kidney and opposes forces driving
glomerular filtration. Tubular concentrating ability and other tubular
functions are also affected, leading to impaired sodium and water
reabsorption, and impaired excretion of acids and potassium. This
results in uremia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and volume depletion.
Following relief of the obstruction, renal tubular impairment may
continue for several days, presumably to resolve the dramatic water
and electrolyte abnormalities that have developed and is known as
postobstructive diuresis.
 The most common causes of obstruction are urethral plug (see Figure

urethral stricture (see Figure 220-4), neoplasia of the bladder neck or
urethra, and extraluminal obstruction (see Figure 136-5). Male cats are
predominantly affected, but obstruction may also occur in female cats.
With correct management, most obstructions are succesfully relived by
catheterization and renal function restored. Difficulty voiding is common
post-obstruction and may be due to reobstruction, urethral spasm, or

urethrospasm and reobstruction.
Differential diagnoses are in two categories. (a) Acute renal failure
causing metabolic derangements may be due to obstructive nephropathy
(ureteral obstruction), toxic nephropathy (e.g., drug therapy or toxin
ingestion), inflammatory nephropathy (i.e., glomerulonephritis or pyelo-
nephritis), and circulatory collapse (e.g., severe dehydration, hypoten-
sion, anemia, heart failure, shock, sepsis, or diabetic ketoacidosis). (b)
 Difficulty or inability to urinate may be due to nonobstructive feline

Urinary Bladder Tumors
Bradley R. Schmidt
Overview
ELINE ABD
Urinary bladder tumors are rare in the cat. Transitional cell carcinoma
7.5
(TCC) is the most common urinary bladder tumor in the cat, with squa-
mous cell carcinoma (SCC) being the second most common tumor, fol-
lowed by leiomyosarcoma. Lymphoma has also been reported in 2 cats.
Leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor of the urinary bladder.
Risk factors for development of urinary bladder tumors in the cat are
U pauapi Aeraua aie sdk shon happeiq Areuun umou ou
older cats, with the mean age for cats with TCC being 13 to 15 years.
Male and female cats were equally represented in all types of bladder
tumors in most studies, but in one study males were over-represented.
Clinical signs are similar to that seen in cats with urinary tract infections
or idiopathic cystitis, with hematuria being reported in all cases of feline
TCC. Other clinical findings may include dysuria, stranguria, pollaky-
uria, a palpably distended urinary bladder secondary to urethral
obstruction, and nonspecific signs such as anorexia, weight loss, or leth-
argy. Azotemia may be noted and may be related to the tumor (second-
M0.8TIS
ary to urethral or ureteral obstruction) or may be due to concurrent
(A)
chronic renal disease. In contrast to dogs, TCC in cats may arise from
any region of the urinary bladder. Ureteral leiomyosarcoma has been
reported in one cat, and urethral leiomyoma resulting in urethral
obstruction was reported in another cat. Metastasis is uncommon at the
time of diagnosis for all tumor types; however, in two series of 31 cats
with TCC, 9 cats developed metastasis to the iliac lymph nodes with 2
of these cats having pulmonary metastasis as well. Extension of the
tumor to the uterine stump and omentum was also noted in 2 cats. Other
reported metastatic sites include the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, dia-
phragm, muscle, and liver.

are generally asymptomatic and are usually composed of calcium
 oxalate; uncommonly chronic or recurrent hematuria occurs with the
origin of the hemorrhage being in the kidneys. See Figure 222-1. When
uroliths are found in the bladder, hematuria and dysuria result. Ureteral
or urethral uroliths cause severe pain, dysuria, or obstruction.
Urine is commonly supersaturated with crystal-producing materials.
However, the presence of crystals does not necessarily predispose the
cat to urolith formation. Urine pH is an important element in crystal
formation; however, it is not the only one or necessarily the most impor-
tant one. Struvite, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, and urate are
less soluble in alkaline urine. Cystine and uric acid are less soluble in
acid urine. Urine pH does not appear to have a major effect on the solu-
bility of calcium oxalate; these uroliths will not dissolve regardless of the
pH of the urine, within the limits of being compatible with life. However,
most calcium oxalate uroliths occur in cats with acid urine. Urinary stasis
 encourages urolith formation regardless of the type.

· Quantitative analysis of the urolith is strongly encouraged. The com-
position of the center of the stone is the most important aspect for
planning preventive measures.
· If bacteria are noted within the center of the urolith, the urolith and
 the cat's urine should be cultured if it has not already been done.
· Interpretation of urine sediment for the presence of bacteria should
be done with caution. Brownian movement may occur in cellular
breakdown products. These breakdown prod ucts may have the same
size, shape, and movement of bacteria. Conversely, it is not unusual 
for urine sediment to be read as free of bacteria but bacteria to be
cultured. Urine culture is recommended.

renoliths. Uroliths causing obstruction of the ureters must be removed
surgically and promptly See Chapters 220 and 275. Uroliths within
the bladder can be removed by retrograde urohydropropulsion or
surgically via cystotomy. It is advised that radiographs be performed 
immediately following cystotomy to verify removal of all of the
(A)
uroliths present. Uroliths lodged within the urethra may be back-
flushed into the bladder for surgical removal or medical dissolution;
however, most urethral uroliths must be removed by perineal
urethrostomy.
● Medical Management: Ureteral uroliths sometimes spontaneously
move retrograde even as far back as the renal pelvis. If surgery is to
be performed, a radiograph should be taken immediately prior to
surgery to verify location. It has been reported that amitriptyline
(1 mg/kg q24h PO for 3 days) may cause retrograde migration of
ureteral uroliths, but this should not be attempted if obstruction is 
present.
● Urohydropropulsion: This nonsurgical technique has been success-
ful in removing small uroliths from the bladder of female cats or from
male cats that have had a perineal urethrostomy. The cat is posi-
tioned so its vertebral column is vertical, directing the neck of the
bladder downward. In this position gravity moves the urolith to
the neck of the bladder. The bladder is manually expressed forcing
the urolith down the urethra and out of the cat.

may be dissolved with Feline Prescription Diet s/d@ (Hill's Pet

CHAPTER 223
Uveitis
Gwen H. Sila and Harriet I. Davidson
Overview
The uvea is the middle portion of the eye made up of the iris, ciliary
body, and choroid. Uveitis may involve any one of these structures
resulting in iritis, cyclitis, or choroiditis, respectively. It may also involve 
combinations of these structures resulting in anterior uveitis (iridocycli-
tis) or posterior uveitis (chorioretinitis). Uveitis may occur alone, or it
may be associated with other ocular or systemic diseases.
 The causes of uveitis are variable, but in over 50% of the cases the
disease is considered idiopathic. However, even with idiopathic uveitis
there is an initiating pathologic process involved although that process
may not be determined. Anything that allows systemic immunocytes
access to the intraocular structures of the immune-privileged eye can
lead to uveitis. This means that destabilization of the blood-aqueous
barrier from trauma, intraocular surgery, systemic inflammation, or vas-
culitis may result in intraocular inflammation. One documented cause
of uveitis is bacterial infection. This may be due to direct bacterial colo-
nization of intraocular structures or hematogenously spread antigen-
antibody complexes. Anytime a severe systemic infection occurs, uveitis

result from the viral infection. Fungal infections that cause uveitis

species (both anterior and posterior chambers) has been reported.
Systemic hypertension may cause retinal detachment (see Chapters 107
and 193) sometimes resulting in severe hyphema. The presence of red
blood cells and other proteins in the eye stimulates an immune response
and can result in chronic uveitis. Intraocular neoplasia is an uncommon
ocular finding that may be present for months before resulting in uveitis.
Primary tumors of the eye include melanoma, postraumatic ocular
sarcoma, and adenoma or adenocarcinoma. See Chapter 122. Secondary
intraocular tumors may result from mammary or uterine adenocarcino-
mas, hemangiosarcoma, or lymphoma (see Figure 223-2). Lymphoma
 can cause uveitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome without neoplastic cells
present within the eye. See Chapter 163. Lens-induced uveitis is caused
by slow leakage of proteins from a cataractous lens (phacolytic uveitis)
that are seen as foreign material by the immune system, resulting in a
low-grade, chronic uveitis. Rupture of the lens capsule (phacoclastic
uveitis) results in rapid release of lens proteins and severe, acute uveitis
that is typically non-responsive to medical therapy. Often surgical
removal of the lens is necessary to save the eye. Corneal ulcers may be
accompanied by uveitis due to the axonal response, where the ciliary
body is stimulated by the ophthalmic nerve as it leaves the cornea result-
ing in a release of local inflammatory mediators.
A transilluminator is critical for complete evaluation of all structures
of the eye including the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris,

 pupil shape.
· Conjunctival vascular engorgement, which can be differentiated
from the engorgement of the underlying scleral vessels based on
movement of the conjunctiva across the surface of the globe. In more
 severe cases the deeper vessels may become inflamed as well.
● Iris color changes may result from either an increase or decrease in
melanin within the iris stroma or due to growth of new iris vascula-
ture (iris rubeosis) and congestion of normal iris vessels. See Figures 
223-1 and 223-2.
● Iris texture changes result from swelling of the iris (see Figure 223-2).
Cells may easily slough off and result in pigmented cells in the ante-
rior chamber and pigment deposits on either lens capsule or corneal
endothelium. Anterior synechia (adhesions from the iris to the
cornea) and posterior synechia (adhesions from the iris to the lens)
may result. Iris nodules, which are accumulations of lymphocytes,
are sometimes seen within the stroma giving it an undulating
appearance.
● Irregular pupillary margins result from changes in the iris stroma

CHAPTER 224
Ventricular Septal Defect
Larry P. Tilley
Overview
 Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is among the most common congenital
heart defect found in the feline. The interventricular septum separates
the left and right ventricles and is divided into membranous and mus-
cular components. Ventricular septal defects may occur in any area of
the septum but more commonly occur in the membranous portion near
the base of the heart. Additionally, concurrent congenital defects may be 
RV
present (i.e., tetralogy of Fallot). Intracardiac shunting of blood results 
when the defect is present.
Clinical significance of a VSD is determined by two factors: the size of
the defect and the relative pressures in the ventricles, which influence
the degree and direction of the shunt. Small defects (restrictive VSDs)
often are of no hemodynamic significance, whereas large defects (non-
restrictive VSDs) are usually of significant hemodynamic consequence.
When left and right ventricular pressures are normal, left-to-right shunt-
ing occurs and the left atrium and ventricle become volume overloaded
secondary to the increased venous return. If pulmonary vascular resis-

· VSDs may exist concurrently with other congenital heart defects.
· Cardiac catheterization and selective angiocardiography are rarely
needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment

· Medical: Medical management of left-sided congestive heart failure
is employed using diuretics, vasodilators, such as angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors, and moderate dietary salt restriction.
· Surgery: Banding of the pulmonary artery may be attempted in cats

· Periodic phlebotomy is indicated if significant polycythemia is
 present in right-to-left shunting VSDs.
Therapeutic Notes
● The response to therapy may be quite variable.
· Digoxin therapy is indicated in selected cases with obvious systolic
dysfunction or arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.
Prognosis
Cats with small-to-medium left-to-right shunting restrictive VSDs typi-
cally have a favorable prognosis, especially if they remain asymptomatic
at 6 months of age. Most cats with significant lesions develop congestive
heart failure within the first few weeks of life or reverse their shunt due
to pulmonary hypertension. Patients with moderate-to-severe cardio-

Diagnostic Notes
· A diagnosis of feline idiopathic vestibular syndrome is based on the
presence of clinical signs, lack of progression, rapid improvement,
and the exclusion of other differential diagnoses. Routine laboratory
tests are within normal limits.
Treatment
Primary Therapeutics
· Supportive Care: The cat should be placed in a quiet area with
minimal stimulation. If imbalance, disorientation, or apprehension is
severe, sedation with diazepam (0.1-0.5mg/kg q6-i2h IV or PO)
may be helpful.
Secondary Therapeutics
● Fluids and Nutrition: Fluid or nutritional support are occasionally
initially needed in cats that are adipsic or anorexic.
● Antiemetics: Dolasetron mesylate (0.3-0.6 mg/kg q12-24h IV or SC),
ond ansetron (0.5-1.0mg/kg q8-12h IV, IM, or SC), metoclopramide
(0.2-0.5 q6-8h PO, SC, or IM or 1-2mg/kg per day constant rate

complete medical examination is needed in all aggression problem
behavior cases. A physical examination should be accompanied by
additional diagnostic tests, as appropriate, such as urinalysis, fecal
examination, and screening tests for metabolic or endocrine dysfunc-
tion. In some cases, additional diagnostic proced ures such as radio-
graphs may be necessary to look for potential sources of pain. Other
areas that can contribute to an increase in irritability include dental
disease, gastrointestinal problems, changes in vision or hearing.
hypertension, and allergies.
· Complete History: All behavior cases require a thorough and com-
plete history for accurate diagnosis. Detailed history and descriptions
of aggressive incidents are essential to identify potential triggers of
aggressive behavior and direct appropriate corresponding treatment.
Historical questions should focus on the aggressive episodes them-
selves, suchas when, where,to whom and how frequentlyaggressive
episodes occur. All participants must be identified to give the best
(A)
description of events. Owner responses and pet responses to owner
intervention must also be explored. This should allow the formula-
tion of a potential diagnostic category and a treatment regime.
· Resources: Information regarding the daily routine, including how
resources are allocated within the home, must be collected. The client
should be questioned about the cat's ability to hide, retreat, or escape
from the locations where aggressive episodes occur. Resources
include, but are not limited to, food, water, liter boxes, toys, hiding
spots, and perching areas. When and how food is provided to the cat
should be explored. Limited resources or poor placement of resources
may lead toaggression.For example, if alitter box is placed in ahigh
traffic area or in a corner, the cat may become aggressive when using
the box if accidentally surprised by an oncoming owner. Multiple
resources and resource locations allow cats to avoid unwanted
human interaction by providing them with alternatives if one
resource is perceived as unsafe due to human occupation.
● Age of Onset: Age of the cat at onset of the problem should be docu-
mented. When cats reach social maturity, around age 1 to 2 years,
they may become more territorial or defensive.

do not respond to catnip will sometimes respond to some of the other
plants known to stimulate olfactory behaviors. It has been experimen-
tally demonstrated that cats detect nepetalactone through the olfactory
epithelium and not through the vomeronasal organ, a unique sensory
organ found in the nasal cavity.
When cats come in contact with the fresh plant, they will smell it and
then rub their face on the plant, as well as the pot containing it. If planted
in a garden, they will roll in the foliage. They have also been observed
to eat and chew the fresh leaves. When exposed to the dried herb, a
variety of behaviors can be observed, including rolling, salivating, vocal-
izing, kneading, head shaking jumping, acting "spaced out" or "frolic-
some," and demonstrating estrous-like behavior (even male cats). The
effect is transient, with the most intense response lasting only a few
minutes. A period of satiation does follow this response, and some have
suggested that to maintain maximal responsiveness, it should not be
offered to cats more than twice a week.

● Feeding: Feral cats spend a significant amount of their time foraging
for food, so increasing the complexity of obtaining food may enrich
the environment for an indoor-only cat. Options include feeder toys,
placing multiple food bowls throughout the home, leaving small
portions in different bowls during the day, hiding treats in boxes and
bags in various areas of the home, and providing food puzzles. Food

appears that some cats prefer soft materials for resting. Suggestions
include chenille, wool, felt, fleece, or even paper. Many cats prefer

· The room needs to be "cat proof." There should be no small, tight
 places where a cat can hide, thereby giving them the freedom to roam 
around the room. This is a stress reducer.
· However, designated hiding places can be stress relievers. Some cats 
like to curl up in a sink. Others prefer a plastic pan (dish pan) or a
designated cabinet. These need to be cleaned after each use.

steel. Laminates are quieter, warmer, and sufficiently durable for 
cats. Our cages (www.clarkcages.com) have been in use for 10 years
and show almost no signs of wear.
· Cage size is usually a compromise between comfort, expense, and
available space. Most cats are comfortable for a few days in a
24" ×24" ×24"(i.e., width, height, depth) cage. Large cats and cats
that are hospitalized longer do wellin 30" × 24" × 24" cages.
● Food and water bowls should be as large on the bottom as on the top
so they do not turn over easily.
● We use two types of litter boxes.Small plastic ones are more appeal-
ing to cats but can consume more cage space and litter. They must
be washed and disinfected between cats. Cardboard litter trays
(www.clinet.com; 7" x 9" flat trays) are well accepted by most cats.
They consume less litter and are disposable so disease transmission
is not an issue.
· Cats on intravenous fluids, with severe diarrhea, or those that are just
(A)
 messy do well on racks that fit into the cages (www.clarkcages.com).
 They allow fluids to go through while being reasonably comfortable
to the cats. A smallhand towel can be put on the rack for lying and
sleeping.
· Elizabethan collars are necessary in select situations. Use a soft collar
when it is acceptable. Hard plastic collars are needed for some
situations (www.kvpusa.com).
● Intravenous catheters can be placed in several peripheral veins. Short
catheters perform well in the cephalic veins for 2 to 3 days. Long
(central venous) catheters can remain in place for up to 7 days,
and blood samples can be collected through them. They can be
placed in the jugular vein or in the medial saphenous vein. See
Cha pter 297.
● Frequently, cats feel more secure when some form of seclusion is
 provided. Cardboard boxes can be used; they should be discarded
Feliway can be sprayed on the boxes for added stress control.

 need less restraint and are less aggressive compared to being in a

always be treated concurrently with behavior modification.
· Confinement with a Litter Box: Limit the cat's access to the areas

likely to spray allows the cat to have an area all by itself without the
presence of the other cats in the household. A cat might want between
4 and 6 hours of alone time daily. Confinement is usually effective in
getting the cat to use the litter box while confined but may not affect

the cat may be out under strict supervision to prevent marking.
· Do Not Punish: Punishment is not an effective tool for changing

nents. Other terms have been used including overgrooming, self-directed
behaviors, displacement activities, and compulsive disorders. In the
past, the term endocrine deficiency alopecia incorrectly described this con
dition. The common link in all of these is that most hair loss appears
to be self-induced from excessive grooming often without any easily
discernable skin lesions. Grooming is a normal feline activity that com-
prises up to 50% of nonsleeping time or 8 to 15% of the total daily time
budget of the domestic cat. When done to excess, damage to the hair
shaft and subsequent hair loss are possible. The supposition in the past
has been because no discernable medical diagnosis could be ascer-

tion as the sole cause or in some cases along with a behavioral compo-
nent and only a small percentage are purely behavioral in origin. Those
that are behavioral in origin may also be compulsive disorders that
arise from underlying conflict, anxiety, or frustration and occur at a
frequency and duration that interferes with daily normal functioning.
Hair loss is most commonly noted on the medial forelegs, caudal area
of the back legs, caudal abdomen, flanks, and lumbar areas. See Figure
238-1.
 Initially it is useful to ascertain the number of grooming bouts, their
length, and intensity. This may be difficult to determine if punishment
has been used in the past and now the cat engages in the behavior away
from the owner. Because hair regrowth is typically slow, diagrams or
photographs of the hair loss and any lesions and their size will be useful
to assess treatment response. In most cases the hair loss occurs in areas
more easily reached by the cat; sides, flanks, back of rear legs, and
abdomen. Interestingly these areas correlate with studies that have
shown that these areas receive the most time in the normal daily feline
grooming ritual.
 There are five circumstances that can cause or contribute to psycho-
or without medical complications.

● Displacement Activities: Displacement activities are behaviors that
occur when an animal is confronted with an acute conflict situation.
Usually these are short lived and self-limiting. If the problem situa-
tion is not resolved, displacement activities can become chronic
outlets for stress and frustration.
● Redirected Behavior: When faced with a frustrating or conflict situ-

is not alleviated, the redirected behavior may be come chronic.
Redirected behaviors can also occur in an environment that does
not meet the needs of the cat for play, exploration, social contact,
and rest.
· Attention Seeking: Animals will engage in behaviors to get owner
attention even when it appears that the behavior is injurious. If
grooming behavior results in picking up, holding, playing with,
or feeding the cat, and if these are rewarding to the cat, then grom-
ing behaviors might be reinforced and ongoing. However,
generally attention seeking alone will not be the sole cause of the
overgrooming.
· Compulsive Disorder: Compulsive disorders are behaviors that are
usually derived from a normal behavioral pattern (in this case groom-
ing) but occur at a higher than normal rate, are difficult to interrupt,
and interfere with the ability of the animal to function normally.
Often animals that have compulsive disorders will engage in the
behavior to the exclusion of most activities except eating and sleep-

· Buspirone is an azapirone antianxiety medication that acts as a
partial serotonin agonist. It may take 2 to 4 weeks to take effect and
is usually given two to three times daily. Side effects include irritabil-
ity, gastrointestinal effects, and occasional paradoxical increase in
anxiety. To be effective it must be given a minimum of twice daily.

CHAPTER 242
Endodontics and Restorations
R. B. Wiggs, S. L. Ruth, and B. C. Bloom
Overview
 Teeth with disease or injury compromising the health and vitality of the
pulpal tissue often require endodontic treatment. Endodontic treatment
helps stabilize the internal portion of the tooth to maintain the integrity
 of the external structure of the tooth and its surrounding periodontium.
The periodontium, in turn, works to hold the teeth stable within the
 alveolus or tooth socket. The internal structure of the tooth is the pulp,
which is encased within the pulp cavity. The pulp itself is a soft-tissue
mass containing many specialized cells, such as odontoblasts, fibro-
blasts, and fibrocytes, as well as connective, vascular, lymphatic, and
nervous tissues. The pulp exits the tooth through the apical delta located
at the apex, or tip of the root, and connects to the periodontium.
The pulp maintains the vitality of the tooth. Once the pulp dies, the
tooth is considered non-vital even if it is still normally seated within its
socket. The dead pulp tissue becomes the host to infections that typically
manifest at the apex of the tooth and surrounding tissues. The degrada-
tion materials percolating from the apex also stimulate an immune
response that results in gradual loss of tooth attachment, which can be
detected radiographically as a radiolucency around the apex of the tooth.
Over time the dead pulp can become a source for chronic bacteremia
Apoq s,ieo au uum sueao snoanu on aseuep un hnsau Aeu ieu

by either extraction or endodontic treatment.

monly have an open apex, or root tip. The process of apexogenesis, when
suiccessful, maintains the tooth's vitality and allows for the completion
of the tooth's root growth, maturity, thickening, and apical closure,
which can make a future root canal procedure possible, if required. The
basic steps of apexogenesis are:
 1. Radiograph the tooth for full assessment of it and adjoining tissues.
 2. Disinfect the oral cavity, usually with chlorhexidine solution (0.2% or 
less).
 3. Inject local anesthesia, such as bupivicaine.
 4. Smooth the fractured tooth surface with a white stone, an aluminum
oxide bur, and number 1/2 or number 1 sterile round ball bur.
 5. Remove 2 to 3mm of pulp tissue with a sterile number 1/4 or number
1/2 round ball bur.
· If bleeding fails to subside within 2 to 3 minutes, apply gentle pres-
sure. If the pressure fails, apply a small amount of a hemostatic
solution or powder.
· If bleeding continues, remove an additional 1 to 2mm of pulp and
repeat hemostasis as outlined previously.
● If all attempts at hemorrhage control fail,the pulp most likely has

dying If this is the case, then apexification or extraction may be
required.
6. Pending hemorrhage is controlled, direct pulp capping can be com-
pleted by applying either 1mm of calcium hydroxide USP powder or
mineral trioxide aggregrate (MTA) directly to the pulp.
 7. Protect the pulp capping material and restore the tooth surface by
applying a layer of glass ionomer such as Microspand Tm Ionosit@. The
restoration should be finished to conform with the immediate tooth
structure. Overbuilding of the restoration only results in structures
that are easily redamaged.
 8. The final restoration should be acid etched and two to three coats of
 an unfilled resin applied to fill any defects and tohelp seal the margins
of the restoration.
· A radiograph of the tooth and its final restoration should then be
taken for evaluation and future reference. See Figure 242-2. The
tooth should re-examined and radiographed every 1 to 6 months
according to the reason of the initial apexogenesis procedure.

This proced ure is typically used for immature permanent teeth that are
non-vital or have irreversible pulpitis (with an immature and incom-

allows for the development of the tooth's root structure and closure of
the apex so that a standard root canal procedure can be performed to

and long duration. Beware of cumulative toxicities with two anesthetic
agents combined; the combined dose should remain below 2mg/kg as
a rule of thumb.
 Toxicity is associated with blockade of neuronal and cardiac sodium
channels. High systemic absorption of a LA can occur from the site of
injection, especially following intrapleural or intercostal blocks. Signs of
LA neurotoxicity include muscle twitching, restlessness, convulsion, or
depression. Intravenous infusion of lidocaine has been shown to have 
deleterious effects on cardiac output in the cat. Therefore, the adminis-
tration of intravenous lidocaine is not advised (continuous infusion or
intravenous regional anesthesia) in the cat. Bupivacaine-induced cardiac
toxicity can be reversed by infusion a lipid emulsion (Intralipid@) in

Colectomy
 Notes
· Significant postoperative complications occur in only 2% of cats that
undergo subtotal colectomy and may include stricture at the surgical
site, loss of vascularity to the bowel, and anastamosis dehiscence or 
peritonitis. Common, transient postoperative problems include
tenesmus and diarrhea.
● Tenesmus usually resolves within a few days of surgery.
● Diarrhea usually resolves within 6 weeks of surgery (S0% of the cats
 in one study), although it has been documented to persist for as long
as 6 months.
·A small number of cats may develop constipation weeks to
months following surgery, but this usually responds to medical
management.
● Cats with pelvic strictures benefit from this surgery, but stool
softening diets and medications are often also needed long
term.
● Rarely the colon will stretch within 6 to 12 months postoperatively.

Cryptorchidism Surgery

that do not descend within the first 2 months of life are unlikely to
do so. The condition can affect one or both testicles, but unilateral crypt-
orchism is more common. Cryptorchid testes can be located inside
or outside the abdominal cavity. In one study, all cats with bilateral
cryptorchism were located intra-abdominally. If located outside the
B
abdomen, the testicle is between the inguinal ring and the scrotum. The
appearance of cryptorchid testicle is usually abnormal as they are usually
soft, small, and irregularly shaped. Persian cats may be predisposed to
the condition.
Diagnosis
● Physical Examination: The absence of both testes in the scrotum by
 2 months of age is considered cryptorchidism.
● Ectopic testes can be located in several locations. Physical examina-
tion should include careful palpation of the scrotum, inguinal area,
and abdominal cavity. Because cryptorchid testicles are often
atrophied and difficult to palpate, ultrasonography may be beneficial
DD
in determining the correct side and location of the teste. In cats,
the large amount of inguinal fat can make it especially difficult to
palpate.
● A complete blood count and biochemistry panel should be performed
 prior to anesthesia to evaluate for other systemic problems including
the potential bone marrow suppression associated with hyperestro-
genism (Sertoli cell tumor).
Procedure
· The treatment of ectopic testes in cats involves the removal of both

testicle determines the surgical approach.
· Caudally directed traction on the scrotal testicle during these proce-
 dures will help to lateralize the retained testicle.
Prescrotal Testicles
· In thin or mature cats the testicle may be palpable. If so, incise
directly over the testicle in the same manner as performed for a
routine castration. Expose the testicle, vas deferens, and associated
vasculature. Triple ligate the vessels and the vas deferens with 2-0 or
3-0 polydiaxanone. Incise between the two most distal sutures and
remove the testicle.
· Close the subcutaneous tissue and skin in routine fashion.

● If the testicle is not found within the inguinal area the incision should
be extended cranially and caudally to allow for a ventral midline
celiotomy.

traction. See Figures 252-1, 252-2, and 252-3.
· Once the testicle is definitively identified remove as previously
described.
●Rarely, the testicle could be located within the inguinal ring.
 Careful dissection in the area to avoid the pudendal vasculature is
essential.
· Gentle traction applied to the testicle should allow for it movement
into the subcutaneous space.
Bladder
● Alternatively, the inguinal ring may be widened to allow for retrac-
tion into the abdominal cavity. The removal of testes through keyhole
incisions and a spay hook is not recommended due to the potential
for ureteral damage.
● If the testicle is not located gently pull on the ductus deferens while
watching for movement in the prescrotal area. Incise over the area of
movement until the testicle is located. See Figure 252-4.

Therapeutic Notes
· Cryptorchidism is believed to be hereditary, and both testicles should
be removed. Breeding of an affected cat is discouraged.
● A cat with an intraabdominal testicle will be infertile in the retained
testicle only due to the increased temperature within the abdomen
as compared to the scrotum.
● Failure to remove a retained testicle, regardless of location, will

Indications
· The jaws of the hemostats are opened, and the hemostats removed
from the cat.
· Any disease-causing prolonged anorexia in a cat that can otherwise
wholly or partially be treated at home. Examples include hepatic
lipidosis, neoplasia with chemotherapy, systemic fungal diseases,
oral disease, and traumatic injuries resulting in sloughing of tissue.
Contraindications
include rupture or obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.
● Diseases of the esophagus, which would be aggravated by the pres-
ence of food or the tube in the esophagus. Examples include esopha-
 gitis, esophageal foreign body, or megaesophagus.
Procedure
● General anesthesia is induced. Choose an agent that will permit
rapid recovery as many of these patients recover slowly from some
anesthetic agents due to their illness. Sevoflurane and isoflurane
by mask or induction chamber with subsequent intubation are this
author's choices.
● The cat is placed in right lateral recumbency.
● The esophagus is located off the midline to the left in the cervical
region. Therefore, the hair on the left side of the neck is shaved, and
the area prepped for surgery.

● Instruct the owner to inject the food at 1 to 2mL per second. If the
cat appears to become nauseated, the feeding rate should be
slowed.
· The tube should be flushed with 2 to 3mL of water following
feeding to clear food from the tube and prevent obstruction.
Maintenance
The tape (not the tube) should be changed about every 2 weeks. There
may be discharge around the ostomy site that needs to be removed, and
often the owner will get food on the tape. The tape is cut along the right
side of the neck to avoid cutting the e-tube. It is peeled off of the hair

two days to allow the esophageal wall to adhere to the muscle and
skin thus creating a fistula that prevents food and liquids from
leaking out of the esophagus into the surrounding tissues. Likewise,
the tube should not be removed less than 2 days after placement.
· The tube may become obstructed if the food mixture is too thick.
Blenderized diets should be poured through a kitchen strainer before
attempting to syringe them through an e-tube. My preferred tube
feeding diet is lams Maximum-Calorierm (The lams Company,
Dayton, OH). With this product straining is not needed.
● If an obstruction occurs within the e-tube, it is most likely in the
plastic fitting because that is the narrowest part of the apparatus. This 
fitting can be pulled out of the e-tube and cleared without removing
the e-tube. If the obstruction is in the tube itself, flushing with 2mL
of a carbonated cola drink may dissolve dried food. If not, the tube
must be removed and replaced.
· Food should be about body temperature. If it is cold, it will be very
difficult to syringe it through the tube, and it is likely to induce
vomiting.
· Vomiting will occur immediately after feeding if too much food is
fed at one time. If this occurs, reduce the quantity of each feeding. A
cat with severe hepatic lipidosis may have a stomach capacity of as
little as 15mL.

Definition
Frontal sinus obliteration is removal of the air-filled frontal sinuses
because of chronic sinusitis.
Overview and Indications
 The paired frontal sinuses are air filled structures located within the right
and left frontal bones dorsal to the eyes. They are separated by a bony
 septum on the midline. They communicate with the left and right halves
of the nasal cavity through a pair of ostia, which permits infections or
tumors that originate from the nasal cavity to ascend into the frontal
sinuses. Once infected, systemic antibiotic therapy is ineffective in
dearing the sinusitis because they become virtually avascular dead
spaces.
Frontal sinus trephination and flushing, obliteration with fat grafts,
and obliteration with methylmethacrylate implants have been used to
treat frontal sinusitis. Temporary response often occurs, but long-term

Although this technique has been successful for treating sinusitis, it
does not offer a cure for the often underlying chronic rhinitis; therefore
the owner's expectations must be realistic. See Chapter 147.
Procedure

Gastrostomy tube placement may also be performed without surgery by
means of an endoscope (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG]

Lip Avulsion Reattachment

This procedure is to surgically reattach of the lower lip (labium) follow-

Procedure
● The tissue should be closely inspected for dirt and other debris. All
foreign material should be flushed from the tissue with copious
amounts of sterile, normal saline. A 35 or 60-mL syringe and a 20-
gauge needle create suficient muzzle velocity to adequately flush the
tissue.

position, it must be detached and the edges freshened. It may be
necessary to undermine adjacent tissue to get the lip to return to its
 normal position.

 gested to be at increased risk for the development of mammary neopla-
sia. Approximately S0 to 90% of mammary tumors in the cat are

Indications
 Mammary neoplasia in the cat should be treated by regional or unilateral
mastectomy. Lumpectomy consisting of local excision of mammary
masses is contraindicated in the cat except when mammary neoplasia

CHAPTER 265
Oronasal Fistula Repair
Heloisa Justen Moreira de Souza
Overview
An oronasal fistula is an abnormal communication between the oral and
nasal cavities. Defects of the hard or soft palate allow food and liquid to
pass easily into the nasal cavity. Palatal defects can be congenital or
acquired.
 The palate separates the oral and nasal cavities. It consists of rostral
and caudal parts. The rostral hard palate consists of bone covered dor-
sally by nasal epithelium and ventrally by the thick, ridged oral palatal
epithelium. The caudal soft palate contains skeletal muscle between the
epithelial surfaces; this muscle forms part of the nasopharyngeal sphinc-
ter that prevents food or fluid from entering the nose during swallowing.
The right and left major palatine arteries are the main arteries to the
mucoperiosteum of the hard palate. The major palatine artery passes
through the caudal palatine foramen and the palatine canal. See Figure
 265-1. It exits the palatine bone through the major palatine foramen and
proceeds rostrally in the palatine groove on the surface of the hard
palate. The palatine foramina are located medial to the maxillary fourth
premolars. The major palatine vessels and nerves course rostrally in the
palatine sulcus supplying the hard palate and adjacent soft-tissue struc-
tures. The palatine grooves, in which the vessels lie, are located halfway
between the alveoli and the midline of the palate.
(A)
 Congenital Oronasal Fistula
Overview
Congenital defects of the lip and palate may be inherited or result from 
intrauterine trauma or stress. Norwegian forest cats, Ocicat, Persian,
Ragdoll, Savannah, and Siamese are breeds at higher risk. These anoma-
lies are describes as affecting the primary palate (premaxilla and lip) and
the secondary palate (hard and soft palates). Incomplete closure of the
(deu) di a so ha Ared e si aeed Aed
Defects of the secondary palate may appear as cleft hard or soft palate
and are usually located on the midline. Cleft palate is a failure of the
palatine processes to fuse properly resulting in a cleft or opening in the
roof of the mouth. Soft palate defects without hard palate defects may
sometimes be unilateral, or the soft palate may be entirely absent.
Unilateral cleft of the soft palate occurs sporadically in cats.

prevent dropping of stool. Alternatively, a purse string suture can be
used to close the anus, but it must not be pulled so tight as to distort
the perianal skin.

be slightly wider than the flap itself to ensure adequate blood supply. In
addition, flaps should be as short as possible to cover the defect.
Wounds should be evaluated carefully with regard to the size, shape,
elasticity of surrounding skin, and character of the recipient bed. Wounds
 present on the trunk of an animal are often amenable to local advance-
ment flaps as described herein. Wounds located on the distal extremities
are managed via releasing incisions and direct closure or mesh grafts.
Prior to placement of free skin grafts the recipient bed must be free of
infection and be covered with healthy granulation tissue.
Single Pedicle Advancement Flaps
Overview
 Single pedicle advancement flaps are the simplest of flaps and rely on
the elasticity of adjacent skin. Preoperative planning for this technique
involves the initial assessment of skin elasticity, and the flap is oriented
in the direction of the least tension. Flap width is dictated by width of
the defect. Flap length is kept to minimum to avoid possible necrosis of
the tip.
Surgical Technique
· See Figure 270-1.
● The skin is grasped with fingers or forceps to assess the best direction
for donor skin advancement.
· Two parallel skin incisions are made equal to the width of the defect.
Alternatively, the incision can be made in a divergent manner to
ensure that the flap is wider at the base.
· The flap is carefully undermined with Metzenbaum scissors until
adequate mobility is obtained.

stretch in response to the tension. This prestretching of skin can be per-
formed a few hours to days before primary closure of the wound occurs.
Regardless of the type of tension relief employed, careful planning is
required for optimal reconstruction.
Prognosis
Flap survival is dependent on numerous factors including overall patient
health as well as the viability of the recipient bed. Prior to graft place-
ment, the recipient should be free of infection and have a good vascular
supply. Culture and sensitivities of the wound should be taken as
needed to aid in antimicrobial therapy Graft sites should be free of
tension and have no sharp edges or points. The presence of tension or
points will greatly increase the risk of dehiscence. Bandages and drains
may be employed on an as-needed basis depending on the mobility of
the tissue and degree of dead space.

● A 1-cm (3/8-in) longitudinal incision is made in the center of the

● The catheter, containing a blunt-pointed metal stylet, is inserted
through the subcutaneous tissue about 1cm (3/8in) off dorsal
midline. It is guided with one hand and pushed with the other until
the fitting is flush with the incision.
· The stylet is removed.
● The fitting is sutured with several soft, nonabsorbable sutures so
it is well anchored to the skin. The fiting should be well anchored
on both sides and at the cranial and caudal ends. If the sutures are
too tight, they will ultimately cut through the skin. The success
of this catheter is largely dependent on successful suturing. See

Therefore, a heparin-saline flush should be performed following each

through the catheter following each fluid treatment. It is important
to begin this process before fibrin buildup occurs because heparin will

· If infection develops around the catheter, do not remove the catheter.
Instead, flush about 5mL of sterile normal saline into the catheter and
aspirate. Perform a culture on the aspirated material to permit proper
antibiotic selection. Administration of an antibiotic directly into the
catheter puts the drug at the site of infection, optimizing the chance
for a positive treatment outcome. Regular fluid therapy can continue
during and after antibiotic therapy. Discuss aseptic technique with
the owner, including soaking of the cap in a dilute bleach solution

CHAPTER 276
Urethrostomy, Perineal
Don R. Waldron
Definition
Perineal urethrostomy (PU) is a surgical method of permanent urinary
diversion in which the penile urethra is excised and the pelvic urethra
sutured to the perineal skin. When performed correctly, PU prevents
most cases of urethral obstruction in male cats. The procedure requires
neutering of the cat, so owners of breeding tom cats should be fully
 informed prior to surgery.
Indications
● PU is the surgical procedure of choice for male cats that suffer
repeated episodes of urethral obstruction as a result of feline lower
urinary tract disease or urethrolithiasis.
● PU is the surgical procedure of choice for male cats with urethral
obstruction that cannot be relieved with urethral catheterization.
● The procedure is sometimes indicated for lower urethral trauma.
 Procedure
· Abdominal radiographs are advisable prior to surgery to rule out
cystic and urethral calculi as causes of obstruction.
· Surgery should not be performed on uremic cats. Intravenous fluid

· Most of the surgical dissection takes place laterally and ventrally to

● Dorsal dissection of periurethral tissues is performed close to the

● The urethra must be incised to the level of the bulbourethral glands
to ensure that the pelvic urethra has been reached. The flared end of
the catheter can be used to determine the urethral diameter.
● Meticulous suturing of the urethral mucosa to skin will minimize
 postoperative hemorrhage and stricture.
· A restraining collar is used to prevent self-trauma for 2 days after
surgery.
· Shredded paper is used instead of litter until healing is complete.
● The patient is sedated for suture removal to minimize trauma to the
urethrostomy site 10 to 14 days following surgery. If dissoluble
sutures are placed, this step is not necessary.
● The cat should be monitored every 6 to 12 months for urinary tract
infection and urolith development for the remainder of its life.

 Complications
· Inadequate suturing of the urinary bladder wall to the skin may
result in dehiscence of the wound.
· The most common complication is urine scalding of the skin of the
ventral abdomen. If the skin protectant ointment is not sufficient, 
 frequent bathing of the skin is recommended.
· If this procedure is used on a long-term basis, urine scaling and
bacterial cystitis will be likely to occur. The bacteria often become
antibiotic resistant over several weeks to months. After 6 to 12
months, the ostium may close so surgery is needed to recreate it.

Tissue Cells
 If a noninflammatory population of tissue cells is identified, features of 
the cells usually allow classification into one of the three cell types:
discrete (round) cells, mesenchymal (spindle) cells, or epithelial cells. See
Table 280-2.
Tissue Cell Types
● Discrete (Round) Cells: Tumors of discrete cell origin typically yield
high cellularity samples of round, small to medium sized, individu-
ally arranged cells with distinct cell borders. Examples of discrete cell
tumors of cats include lymphoma, mast cell tumor, and plasma cell
tumor. See Figures 280-6 and 280-7.
● Epithelial Cells: These cells are medium to large in size appearing
round to caudate in shape and are usually present in cohesive clus-
ters with distinct cellular borders. Neoplastic populations of epithe-
lial cells are termed carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are epithelial
tumors of glandular origin. See Figures 280-8 and 280-9.

CHAPTER 281
Adenocarcinoma
Amy C. Valenciano, Rick L. Cowell, and Tara P. Arndt
Overview
 Adenocarcinomas are malignant tumors of glandular epithelial origin.
These tumors may arise from any glandular tissue including sites such
as: ear (ceruminous glands), nasal, gastrointestinal, mammary, biliary,
pancreatic, or subcutaneous adnexal tissue (sebaceous and apocrine
glands).
Cytologic Features
Glandular epithelial cells can be identified cytologically by high exfolia-
tion, large cell size, tendency to cluster and form an acinar pattern, and
 by the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles of secretory material. Cells
of glandular origin should be evaluated for criteria of malignancy as
described in Chapter 280. Although adenomas will be fairly uniform in
size and appearance, adenocarcinomas generally will show malignant

CHAPTER 283
Fibrosarcoma
Amy C. Valenciano, Rick L. Cowell, and Tara P. Arndt
Overview
Fibrosarcomas are malignant tumors of mesenchymal tissue origin, spe-
cifically, of fibrocytes. These tumors are invasive and recurrent, but
uncommonly metastatic. They represent nearly 17% of all skin tumors
in cats. Aside from the skin, fibrosarcoma can also arise in mammary
tissue, the oropharynx, and intestine. Injection-site sarcoma is a specific
type of sarcoma that arises at sites of previous injections of vaccines and
other products. Detailed information regarding the diagnosis of suspect
injection-site sarcomas established by the Vaccine-Associated Feline
Sarcoma Task Force can be found at: www.avma.org/vafstf/. See
Chapter 197.
Cytologic Features
Most mesenchymal tumors are poorly exfoliative and hemodilute upon
fine-needle aspiration. When aspirates fail to yield sufficient cells for
 evaluation, a nonaspiration technique should be considered. This can be
accomplished by inserting the needle into the mass and redirecting
without aspirating (tattoo technique). Once the needle is removed, an

sary for diagnosis.
When cells do exfoliate on aspiration or nonaspiration fine-needle
shaped appearance with indistinct cell margins. Cytoplasm can be scant
to moderate and is often basophilic. Nuclei range from slender and
elongate to plump and ovoid. Most cells are uninucleate, but multinucle-
ate cells may be found in lesser numbers. See Figure 283-1. Cells may be
present individually or in aggregates, and occasionally mesenchymal
cells may be observed producing a bright pink amorphous to fibrillar
matrix. See Figure 283-2. Cytology samples of mesenchymal tissue
 should be evaluated for criteria of malignancy as described in Chapter
of a sarcoma, with the caveat that uniform, minimally atypical cells can
be seen with well-differentiated, yet malignant, neoplasms. In this case,
histopathology is needed for definitive characterization of biologic
behavior.
 Most sarcomas, including fibrosarcomas, appear similar on cytology.
Thus, histopathology, occasionally with the aid of special stains, is
needed to distinguish the different types of sarcomas. Special caution
must be made with any cytologic diagnosis of sarcoma because non-
neoplastic fibrous tissue that is reactive secondary to inflammation can
display significant criteria of malignancy and be indistinguishable from

 Differentiation of spontaneous versus injection-site sarcoma, both
cytologically and histopathologically, can be difficult. However,
development of a sarcoma at a site of previous injection/vaccination
and the presence of foreign material suggests injection association.

Lymph Node with Metastatic Neoplasia
Metastatic neoplasia can be identified on cytologic evaluation of lymph

present in lymph node cytologic preparations in variable numbers and
will often display criteria of malignancy. See Figure 285-3. Refer to
Chapter 280 for more information regarding criteria of malignancy.
Increases in the number of cells other than lymphocytes (e.g., mast cells,
plasma cells, or histiocytic cells) that are normally present in lymph

lymph nodes are considered benign with surgical excision being cura-
tive. However, the diagnosis of cutaneous mast cell tumor should be
followed by assessment for lymph node and visceral involvement.
Multifocal cutaneous mast cell tumors, development of multiple tumors,
recurrence of mast cell neoplasia, and splenic mast cell neoplasia are
often associated with a guarded prognosis.
 Unlike in the canine, histological grade is not predictive of biologic
behavior in the feline. Histologically, benign tumors are usually com-
posed of uniform, well-differentiated cells with a low mitotic index.
Poorly differentiated tumors with invasion and a high mitotic index are
associated with a worse prognosis. Further information about mast cell
neoplasia can be found in Chapter 135.
Cytologic Features
Aspirates from mast cell tumors usually exfoliate high numbers of cells

granules have a high affinity for cytology stains; therefore, on occasion,
the granules may uptake all of the stain entering the cell leaving the
nucleus understained (pale blue). See Figure 287-2. Granules from rup-
tured mast cells are usually observed free in the background of the
smear. Variable numbers of eosinophils and fibroblasts may also be seen
in samples from mast cell tumors. See Figure 287-3. Some cutaneous
mast cell tumors in the feline contain mast cells almost exclusively, with
eosinophils being rare to absent. This is in contrast to canine mast cell
tumors in which eosinophils are often present in high numbers.
Cytologically, most neoplastic mast cells are uniform, heavily granu-
lated, and demonstrate minimal criteria of malignancy. However, some
mast cell tumors may consist of mast cells that are poorly granular to
agranular, especially tumors involving the intestine. In the intestine,
mucosal mast cells appear to differ from mast cells derived from the
mesenchyme, and are often agranular. See Figure 287-4. Pleomorphic
and agranular mast cells can be difficult to distinguish from other
discrete cell tumors (i.e., histiocytic neoplasia, plasma cell neoplasia,

lymphosarcoma). Additionally, fast Romanowsky-type
stains
(Diff-Quik) can sometimes fail to stain mast cell granules or cause them

Effusions secondary to FlP are characterized by a high protein content,
often 4.5gm/dL or more, rarely as low as 3.6gm/dL. The high protein
content lends a viscous nature to the fluid. Effusions secondary to FIP
can have quite a range in cellularity, with cell counts occasionally
dipping into the modified transudate range, to very cellular specimens
containing 20,000 cells/μL or greater. Cytologically, there is a character-
istic basophilic, stippled, proteinaceous fluid background with a near
equal mix of nondegenerate neutrophils, foamy, cytophagic macro-

matory cells are generally well preserved and infectious agents are not 
observed. See Figure 288-1.

Septic effusions are of moderate to high protein content and are one of
the most cellular fluid specimens. Thus, grossly the fluid is yellow and

Transtracheal Wash Hemosiderosis
Tara P.Arndt, Rick L. Cowell, and Amy C.Valenciano
Overview
 Transtracheal wash (TrW) samples are a common diagnostic test in
evaluating feline respiratory disease. Hemosiderin-containing macro-
 phages (hemosiderophages) have been found in a variety of underlying
pathologic conditions in the feline patient. Classically hemosiderophages
were refered to as "heart failure cll"; however, hemosiderophages
cardiac disease and pulmonary hypertension. Airway hemosidero-
phages have been associated with a diverse variety of other diseases
including feline asthma syndrome, complicated and uncomplicated rhi-
nitis, pulmonary neoplasia (primary or metastatic), primary or concur-
rent heart disease, pneumonia of varied causes, trauma, pulmonary
embolism or infarction, lung lobe torsion, as well as neurologic disease.
Alveolar hemorhage can be attributed to several mechanisms including
enhanced diapedesis secondary to increased pulmonary vascular con-
gestion due to cytokine effects and microtrauma secondary to low-grade
irritation due to coughing.

Radiographs of Cranial Mediastinal Mass
(A)
· Roentgen signs of cranioventral mediastinal masses include an
increase in soft-tissue opacity cranial to the heart. The trachea may
be displaced dorsally or to the right. Larger mediastinal masses may
compress the trachea and may silhouette with the cranial border of
the heart. There may be varying amounts of pleural and pericardial
effusion. The cranial lung lobes may be displaced caudally.
Ultrasound of Cranial Mediastinal Mass
● Ultrasound allows a quick and easy way to rule out a mediastinal
mass when pleural effusion is present. If a mass is present, ultrasound-
guided aspiration can be safely done in sedated patients.
· Locate the heart, and then move craniad one intercostal space
directing the transducer cranially and dorsally toward the thoracic
inlet. The normal mediastinum contains large vessels surrounded
by varying amounts of hyperechoic fat. See Figures 291-1 through
291-3.
Mediastinal Cyst
● Mediastinal cysts are rare findings that have similar radiographic
findings to cranial mediastinal masses. The cystic nature of these
lesions can be determined with ultrasound. Coughing is often the
presenting clinical sign. See Figure 291-4.
Hilar Lymphadenopathy
● Enlargement of the hilar lymph node can cause a mass effect in the
cranial mediastinum. Lymphadenopathy is usually in response to
local infection. See Figure 291-5.

Interstitial Lung Pattern
 The interstitial pattern can be divided into structured or unstructured

The borders can be smooth and well demarcated. "Fuzzy" nodules occur
when an inflammatory component is present. Differentials include: (a)
primary neoplasia, (b) metastatic neoplasia, (c) pulmonary abscess, (d)
mycotic or granulomatous pneumonia, (e) traumatic pneumatocele, and
(f) hematoma or cysts.

disease without an inflammatory component. Differentials include
primary lung tumor, walled-off abscess, and metastatic neoplasia.
· Primary pulmonary neoplasia is rare in feline patient. The appear-

 Additional radiographic signs associated with primary neoplasia
include dystrophic mineralization, pleural effusion, and intrathoracic
lymphadenopathy. See Figures 291-31 and 291-32.
· A single poorly defined nodule indicates that the expanding lesion
has an inflammatory component. Differentials include abscess, para-

● Multiple well-demarcated nodules usually represent neoplasia espe-
cially if the nodules have different sizes more consistent with meta-
static neoplasia. The nodules may be variably sized with borders that

care to avoid the falciform ligament, which would result in an unsuc-
cessful study.
● Barium is harmful to the peritoneum and should not be injected into
the peritoneal cavity.
● The procedure may fail to detect herniation in which herniated solid
organs or other tissue prevents movement of the contrast medium
outside the peritoneal cavity.
● In a normal celiogram, radiopaque iodinated contrast will be seen
outlining the intestinal loops and other abdominal organs. Margins
of the contrast should be smooth.
Ultrasonography of the Normal Peritoneal Cavity
· The interface between the diaphragm and lung is shown as a smooth
hyperechoic line. Mirror image artifact can cause the liver to appear
to be located cranial to the lung-diaphragm interface. Care should 
be taken to avoid interpreting this artifact as a diaphragmatic hernia
 or peritoneopericardial hernia.
· A small amount of free anechoic fluid can be present, particularly in

 abdominal surgery.
 Abnormal Fluid in the Peritoneal Cavity
● On radiography, decreased visualization of serosal surfaces can indi-
cate the presence of abnormal fluid accumulation in the peritoneal
cavity.
● Causes of free fluid (see Figure 292-1) include ascites from hepatic or
cardiac disease, peritonitis, neoplasia, hemorrhage, rupture of a
hollow organ (i.e., urine, bile, and intestinal contents), and recent
surgery.
● It is important to realize that loss of serosal detail occurs because fat
is no longer providing sufficient contrast between soft-tissue struc-
tures in the abdomen. Loss of serosal detail occurs not only when
fluid is present but also when there is minimal fat (see Figure 292-2)
or when the fat is obscured because of a mass or masses in the

SECTION 6: Imaging
Free Gas in the Peritoneal Cavity
· Causes of free gas include rupture of the gastrointestinal tract, a
penetrating wound, infection with gas-prod ucing organisms, and
recent surgery.
· On radiography, a significant amount of gas can increase visualiza-
tion of serosal surfaces. Loops of intestine surrounded by gas appear
brighter than when normally seen. Abnormal gas patterns can be
diagnostic. Intraluminal gas will have smooth circular or oval
borders. Extraluminal gas outliningbowel and other organs will have
sharp angular margins. See Figure 292-5B. Gas is sometimes seen
between the liver and diaphragm.
· Small amounts of gas can be diagnosed by using a horizontal beam 
while the patient is placed in left lateral recumbency or dorsal recum-
bency. These positions allow gas to rise where it can be visualized
with the horizontal beam. See Figure 292-5C.
· On ultrasonography, gas is hyperechoic with deep reverberation arti-
(A)
fact Small amounts of gas are difficult to identify. Care must be taken
so that gas in bowel or lung is not mistaken for free peritoneal gas.
Abdominal Herniation
· Intestines and other abdominal organs can herniate through the
diaphragm or abdominal wall.See Figure 292-6. Peritoneo-pericardial
herniation is a congenital problem in which abdominal contents
herniate into the pericardial sac. See Figure 292-7. Disruption of the
diaphragm or abdominal wall might be apparent on survey radiog-
raphy. In some cases, intestinal gas allows visualization of displaced
bowel.
● Gastrointestinal contrast agents can be used to help localize the intes-
tines, but there can be herniation of solid organs (i.e., liver, spleen,
mesentery, or falciform fat) without simultaneous herniation of
bowel. Abnormal cranial displacement of the gastrointestinal tract

might be visible in some of these cases, particularly if barium is
administered.

· Celiography can be useful to demonstrate interruption of the
diaphragm and abdominal wall and to outline abdominal organs.

to identify displaced intestine. Similarly, cystography can be used to
determine the location of the urinary bladder when an inguinal or

● Ultrasonography can be useful to detect herniated contents.

Imaging of the Body Wall
· The body wall can be examined with radiography or ultrasonogra-
phy to determine integrity (see Abdominal Herniation) or evaluate
involvement of the body wall in cases with neoplasia.
· Computerized tomography (CT) is also valuable for determining the 
extent of neoplasia. See Figure 292-8.

neoplasms may have areas of hemorrhage, necrosis, or inflammation
that contribute to this pattern of echogenicity.
· Abscesses are uncommon, but may appear solid (hyperechoic or

areas. Parasitic cysts can also occur.

Imaging of the Urinary Bladder and Urethra
(A)
Radiography of Normal Feline Urinary Bladder and Urethra
· The feline bladder is described as having the shape of a teardrop or
ellipse.
· The intra-abdominal urethra of the cat is long compared to that of
the dog so the bladder is more cranially located.
Cystography
· Cystography is used for evaluation of the urinary bladder wall and
contents. Cystography is preferred over ultrasonography for confir-
 mation of a ruptured urinary bladder.
● Ionic organic iodinated contrast media are used for positive contrast
cystography. If there is a possibility of extravasation of contrast into
the peritoneal cavity, nonionic contrast media could be used to
reduce possible side effects including dehydration. Air is usually
used for negative contrast cystography. Carbon dioxide is less
convenient (and less commonly used) but is more soluble
in
blood and is thus, less likely to cause embolism. A combination of
positive and negative contrast media is used for double contrast
cystography.
· On positive contrast cystograms, the bladder contour is smooth. The
contrast is uniform with no radiolucencies seen.
● On negative contrast cystograms, the air should smoothly outline the
mucosal surface of the bladder if all urine has been removed. If the
urine is not removed, the air forms a bubble above the urine.
Measurement of wall thickness will not be accurate because the urine

likely to be irregular and less well marginated. Gravity will cause
them to be located centrally in the lateral recumbent view. Blood clots 
can be more difficult to differentiate.
· On ultrasonography, hypoechoic material in the lumen can represent
blood cells, clots, cellular debris, or fat droplets. Calculi (see Figure
292-75) in the lumen are usually hyperechoic and will be present in
the dependent side of the urinary bladder, although uncommonly
calculi will adhere to the bladder mucosa and not move as expected.
They are variable in size and number and may exhibit deep acoustic
shadowing. Small calculi or crystals may become suspended in the
lumen of the bladder.
Ruptured Bladder
·Rupture of the urinary bladder can result from trauma or
obstruction.
· Survey radiography shows decreased serosal detail resulting from
urine free in the peritoneal space. See Figure 292-77A. The amount
of time elapsed since trauma and the size of the tear will determine

or chronic. The mucosa may also be irregular. Large projections into
the lumen can be seen in neoplasia or polypoid cystitis.
· An urachal diverticulum can cause a bulge in the cranial margin of
the bladder. This may be more obvious on excretory urography; it
may be induced when too much contrast material is infused during
positive cystography. It may or may not be associated with clinical
signs.
· A nondistensible bladder wall may occur in chronic cystitis.
● Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in normal cats and either air or contrast
 can be present in the kidneys after double contrast cystography.
● On ultrasonography, the urinary bladder wall is often thickened and
sometimes irregular. When evaluating the bladder wall, remember
to consider the degree of distension because an empty bladder could
appear thickened. Conversely, disease could be missed in an overly
distended bladder. In emphysematous cystitis, gas may appear
hyperechoic with deep reverberation artifact.

Bladder Neoplasia
● Transitional cell carcinoma is the most common neoplasm found in
the feline urinary bladder. Other neoplasms include squamous cell
carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma, heman-
giosarcoma or hemangioma, fibroma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and
 primary or secondary lymphoma.
● Survey radiography usually shows a normal bladder unless dystro-
 phic mineralization is present. Sublumbar lymphadenopathy may be
present if there is metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes.
Metastasis could also be seen in the thorax or bones. The kidneys or
ureters may be enlarged if there is hydronephrosis or hydroureter
associated with a mass at the trigone.

Skull views
Purpose
● Evaluation of the skull for trauma, nasal and sinus disease, nasopha-
ryngeal polyps, periodontitis, otitis media, staging of neoplasia, ne-
rologic disorders, and temporomandibular joint disease.
Clinical Indications
● Trauma to the temporomandibular joint
· Nasal disease including intranasal neoplasia, chronic rhinosinusitis,
foreign body, and neoplasia
·Nasopharyngeal polyps
· Tympanic bullae-otitis media and neoplasia
● Periodontal disease (see Chapters 240 and 245)
· Neurologic disorders
Figure 293-1A 7-week-old kitten presented for seizures. The calvarium was markedly
enlarged and abnormally shaped. Radiographic signs are suggestive of hydrocephalus.
Technique
· General anesthesia required.
● Symmetrical positioning is critical for proper evaluation of subtle
changes.
● Lateral and dorsoventral views of the skull are standard.
· Additional views needed for complete evaluation of skull such as
frontal view, open mouth ventrodorsal view, intraoral doroventral
view, lateral oblique view, and oblique views of upper and lower
arcade for dental evaluation (see Chapter 245).
● Temporomandibular joints are readily viewed on the dorsoventral
projection. Oblique views of the feline skull require rotation of the
 skull 20 degrees from ventrodorsal.
· Nasal disease requires symmetrical views of the skull including open
mouth ventrodorsal, frontal view, intraoral dorsoventral, and lateral
oblique views. See Chapter 146.
● Nasopharyngeal polyps can be visualized most consistently from the
lateral projection. See Chapter 149.
● Tympanic bullae can be visualized on open mouth rostrocaudal, left
dorsal 20-degree right ventral oblique, and right dorsal 20-degree left
ventral oblique views.

Normal Findings
● The normal myelogram consists of thin parallel columns of contrast 
medium in the subarachnoid space outlining the spinal cord.
· The spinal cord normally widens in the caudal cervical and caudal
lumbar regions due to the brachial and lumbar intumescences.
● In normal myelograms, the cervical spine cord of a cat appears pro-
 portionally wider than that seen in dogs. The contrast columns are
comparatively narrower.
Common Lesions
● Inflammatory diseases caused by feline infectious peritonitis, toxo-
in cats. Myelography and MRI studies may be normal.
● Infrequent problems in cats include intervertebral disc disease, spinal
cord trauma, lymphosarcoma, and spinal cord infarction. In one MRI
study, neoplasia was the most common spinal cord disease.
(B)
● Lesions can be categorized as intramedullary (within the cord), extra-
 medullary intradural, and extradural.
● In intervertebral disc disease, myelographic signs (see Figure 293-24)
reflect extradural compression and include narrowing of the disc
space with or without mineralization of the disc, dorsal displacement
of the ventral contrast column in the lateral view, and thinning of the 
contrast columns in the ventrodorsal view. The contrast columns
may be displaced lateral in the ventrodorsal view. An intramedullary
pattern may be present if there is significant cord swelling.
· Similar findings will be present on MRl with narrowing of the
intervertebral disc space, dorsal displacement of the ventral spinal
cord on the sagittal image, and variable degree of ventral to
lateral compression on the transverse image. See Figures 29325
and 293-26.
· Lymphosarcoma can invade either the vertebral column or nervous
system or both. There may be involvement of the spinal cord or the
neoplasm may involve intradural or extradural structures. In survey
radiography, there may be lysis of one or more vertebrae. See Figures 
293-27 and 293-28.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Collection
Mitchell A.Crystal
Definition
 The retrieval of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid space
for laboratory evaluation.
Indications
· To determine the general nature of central nervous system disorders;
however, only on occasion does CSF collection and evaluation reveal
a specific diagnosis.
· To further investigate fever of unknown origin once common causes
have been eliminated.
Contraindications
● Increased intracranial pressure; clinical signs may include anisocoria,
 mydriatic or nonresponsive pupils, dull mentation or altered state of
consciousness, rigid paresis, altered respiratory patterns and heart
rhythms (especially bradycardia), or coma

 Examination
Karen R. Brantman and Harriet I. Davidson
Overview
 The techniques of ophthalmic examination are not complicated, but they
do require practice to perform easily on a cat. First, a complete history
of the cat's eye problems, health problems, and potential familial prob-
lems should be taken. Next, perform the ophthalmic examination before
tion room should be dark and quiet to prevent distraction and allow
greater visualization of intraocular structures. Finally, perform a com-
 plete physical examination.
Examination of Head and Face
● The face should be carefully evaluated prior to restraining the cat.
Touching the cat's face or stressing the cat may mask the true position
of ocular and periocular structures.
● Evaluate for symmetry and evidence of neurologic problems such as
head tilt, ear droop, or loss of muscle mass.
· Evaluate eyelids for conformation prior to touching the face. The
eyelid margin should be visible along all edges.
● Evaluate the eyes to determine if they are both tracking and are of

CHAPTER 305
Nasal Sampling
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
nosing cats with chronic or acute rhinitis or rhinosinusitis. Collecting
samples from within the nasal cavity instead of discharges that exit the
nares are more likely to be representative of the true etiology. This
chapter describes two methods for so doing.
 Skull radiographs are necessary to determine if nasal sampling is
indicated and to determine the appropriate area in which to perform
sample collection. General anesthesia is necessary for correct positioning
and imaging of the nasal cavity. The most useful view is an open mouth
ventrodorsal radiograph. See Figures 146-1 and 147-1. Increased opacity
in the nasal area indicates the need for aspiration. See Figure 305-1. In
this cat if nasal aspiration is chosen, it should be performed at the level
of the arrow about 2mm (1/8in) off the midline. If nasal flushing is
chosen, the left nasal cavity should be flushed.
Nasal Aspiration
 Nasal aspiration involves the use of a small gauge needle to aspirate
material from within the nasal cavity. The described technique uses a
transpalatine approach.
Figure 305-1  An open-mouth ventrodorsal radiograph of the nasal cavity is used to 
choose the site for nasal aspiration.In this cat, the needle should enter the nasal cavity
at the level of the arrow about 2 mm [1/8in] off the midline.
Procedure
Once the area and need for aspiration has been determined, the cat is
placed in ventral recumbency. It is important that a cuffed endotracheal
tube be in place. A22-gauge disposable needle and a 6- or 12-mL syringe
are used. The needle insertion point is determined based on the radio-
graph. Dentition and the distance offof the median septum are used to
'aeed pieu au aeauad ot pasn st uoou urp y aos uoisod
See Figure 305-2. Once the needle has passed into the nasal cavity, make
several aggressive aspirations with the syringe to obtain a sample. When
the sample is collected the needle is withdrawn. Pressure should be
applied to the biopsy site if bleeding occurs. Occasionally, a few drops
of blood will exit the nares. The sample is expressed onto a clean slide,
and a smear is made. The slides should be stained and evaluated for
cellular content then submitted to a veterinary pathologist. If only blood
is present the procedure should be repeated.Some of the sample should
also be reserved for aerobic and or anaerobic bacterial culture and sen-
sitivity. Another portion should be placed on a sterile dacron-tipped
applicator and submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing
for viral respiratory pathogens.

The needle insertion point is determined based on the radiograph.

Necropsy of Kittens
Michele Fradin-Ferme
Overview
 Making a definitive diagnosis on a very young dying kitten is difficult
because symptoms are not specific and usually include hypothemia,
agitation, crying, dyspnea, or cyanosis. Blood analysis is not easily done 
due to the limited quantity of blood and the difficulties of collection. A
 properly performed, thorough necropsy can allow a diagnosis by obser-
vation of gross lesions and performance of numerous laboratory
analysis.
know if there is an infectious or a genetic disease ocurring in their
breeding colony. Gross necropsy and sample collection are performed
at the veterinary hospital when pathology laboratories prefer to receive
samples of organs rather than a whole kitten.
 Necropsy of kittens should be performed as often as possible to
become proficient in the procedure and to recognize normal kitten
anatomy. The heart and liver are prominent in a normal kiten compared
to an adult cat. There is always some fluid in the body cavities of a
newborn kitten after it has been frozen then defrosts; this is not patho-
logical or ascites. See Figure 306-1.

● Orogastric tube feeding is for hospitalized anorectic patients. It can

CHAPTER 310
Restraint Techniques and Devices
Gary D. Norsworthy
Overview
 Restraint is a vital part of successful feline practice. Although most feline
patients are cooperative and easily handled, some are either difficult or
fractious. Difficult cats can generally be handled as long as proper tech-
niques and restraint devices are used. However, they have the potential
of accelerating to the fractious category. Fractious cats must be proac-
tively restrained or they will become dangerous to veterinarians, staff,
and owners. Generally, anesthesia is needed for most procedures.
The Difficult Cat
Definition
 These cats are manageable but can convert to fractious. They usually hiss

· Blood samples can be taken from the medial saphenous vein when

 towel then picking them up.
● They can be "poured" from plastic carriers into a bath towel.
· Cat bags and cat muzzles can be effective.
● Placing Elizabethan collars on them often permits safe handling.
· If they try to hide in a litter box, cover the liter box with a towel and
lift it from the cage. Once out of the cage, most of these cats are
 manageable using the techniques and devices above.
● Cats in soft carriers can be handled with a large bath towel. The cat's
head must be facing the end of the carrier that unzips. The top of the
carrier is unzipped, and the towel is placed over the cat so it cannot
move. It is restrained within the towel by one technician. The end of
the carrier is unzipped, and an anesthesia mask is placed over the
cat's face so anesthetic gas can be administered. See Figure 310-1.

Overview
In addition to constituting a key component of a patient's signalment,
age is a necessary part of the history for guiding many diagnostic and
therapeutic recommendations and prognoses. Knowledge of a patient's
age has many implications. Age may help differentiate normal anatomy
from an abnormal lesion. It is considered when administering medica-
tion and is used to adjust drug dosages and anesthetic protocols. Age
also has a strong bearing on the formulation of a list of differential diag-
a known date of birth, and the age of the cat must be approximated.
However, there is little information available to help guide the feline
practitioner in this endeavor. Although there is some objective data
available for determining various stages in a cat's growth, such as
growth plate closure times, dental eruption times, and behavioral devel-
 opment, a lot information is strictly empirical. Studies are still needed
to document more precisely when various changes occur in a cat's devel-
opment, but until then, the information in this chapter is presented to
help take some of the guesswork out of age approximation.

Dental Eruption Times

the special needs of cats based on life stage, especially the aging cat. Cats

actual year of a cat's life thereafter. For this reason, mature, senior,
and geriatric cats should be assessed on a more frequent schedule
than their younger counterparts. Whereas an annual examination may
be acceptable for young, healthy cats, a general guideline for older
cats is every 6 months for physical examination and biochemical
evaluation.
Examination of a young and otherwise healthy cat may focus on
nutrition/obesity, dental care, or behavior, but the examination of an
older cat will likely focus more on weight changes, dental disease,
grooming changes, increased incidence of hypertension, renal disease,
neoplasia, endocrinopathy, pain, and quality of life assessment. General
knowledge of approximate age and life stage will help to guide veteri-
narians in making appropriate wellness recommendations to clients of

Overview

 As feline medicine has evolved over the past 30 years, we are finding
multiple examples of the fallacy of that assumption. This chapter con-
trasts some of the clinically significant anatomical differences in the two
species.
 Clinically Significant Anatomical Differences
● In general, the long bones of the limbs (both thoracic and pelvic) of
the cat are straighter than those of the dog. Also, the bodies of the
lumbar vertebrae are relatively longer in the cat than in the dog.
Clinical significance: This can be useful in identifying cat versus dog
on an unlabeled radiograph.

Overcoming Barriers to Veterinary Visits

the challenges associated with bringing a cat to the clinic are given below.
Once the client arrives at the veterinary clinic, the health-care team can take steps to reduce stress for both the
 some tips to facilitate examination and treatment.
Reducing the stress of transport

 - Keep the transport carrier out and accessible in the home.

 Create and maintain a positive association with the transport 
carrier by making it a comfortable resting, feeding
or play location.
rides paired with positive experiences.
· withholding food prior to travel may prevent motion sickness,
increase interest in treats at the clinic, and is beneficial if blood is
to be collected.
 Apply a calming synthetic pheromone to, and/or place familiar
clothing from a favorite person in, the carrier on a routine basis
 and just prior to transport.13,14
Making the cat and client comfortable at the clinic
 Minimize waiting times.
 Provide elevated platforms in the waiting area so owners can place cat carriers out of reach of dogs.
 Use calming synthetic pheromones in the environment.14
 Facilitating the examination and treatment
+ Provide a cat-friendly exam room:
 Keep the room and table warm, with a non-slip surface for the cat.
 Avoid loud noises or ambient sounds that may mimic hissing (eg,
whispering).
 Distract and reward with tasty treats/catnip/play.
Handle using minimal restraint:
 See AAFP Feline Behavior Guidelines for tips on handling cats 
 during the veterinary examination.10
While gathering historical information, allow the cat time to adjust
jo joop aui bujudo jo dot au buaowai Aq shupunons aul o1
the carrier. The cat should ideally remain in the bottom half of the 
carrier for as much of the exam as possible; this allows it to adjust to the
 examiner and the environment.15,16
Allow the cat to hide partially under a towel; use towels, rather than 
scrufing, for handling where additional restraint is needed.
Avoid making eye contact with the cat.
 Determine the most comfortable position for the cat during the examination,
 such as the veterinarian's lap.
 Use sedation, anesthesia or analgesics as indicated to reduce stress and/or
pain.

Parturition
Overview
Neonatal survival is directly related to the quality of labor. Dystocia is
not uncommon among cats; according to one study approximately 15%
of births needed veterinary intervention, and 8% of those resulted in
caesarean section. It has been reported that Siamese and Siamese-related

cats may have higher risk for dystocia than other breeds. See Chapter 60.

 tion. Milk can usually be expressed from the mammary glands 24 to 48
hours before delivery.
Phases of Parturition
Phase I of parturition begins at the first observed contractions and ends
at the birth of the first kitten. The median duration of phase I is 30 to 60
minutes, and usually it takes less than 2 hours. Labor starts with mild
straining and discomfort for 30 to 60 minutes changing to hard labor
involving pronounced straining and discomfort, which usually lasts 5 to

Vibrissae (whiskers) serve many important functions. As specialized
tactile hairs, they constantly monitor the environment and channel
sensory information to the cat's nervous system. Vibrissae help the cat
estimate the size, shape, and presence of objects without seeing or touch-
ing them. Because whiskers are freely movable, their position offers an
outward indicator of a cat's emotions and attitude about its immediate
environment.
Vibrissae are recognized as specialized hairs called "sinus hairs." They
are stiffer and several times thicker than other hairs and taper toward
their distal ends. Vibrissae are contained in deeper, wider follicles than
other hairs. Each follicle has at least one sebaceous gland and a bit of
striated muscle attached to its outer layer, allowing for voluntary move-
ment of the whisker. An endothelial-lined blood sinus is also found in
these follicles. The follicular blood sinuses of facial whiskers are abun-
dantly supplied with branches of the trigeminal nerve, although whis-
kers themselves do not contain nerves.

SECTION 8: Appendixes
Shortening or Loss
Whiskers are periodically shed by healthy cats, just as normal hair is
shed. Lost whiskers willregrow and are typically replaced in a matter
of a few months.
 Not uncommonly, the queen will shorten or bite off the whiskers of
her Kkittens as she grooms them. This does not appear to cause any harm,
and the whiskers will be replaced in time. Also, cats are sometimes
reported to barber or chew off the whiskers of other cats in their house-
hold, though the reasons for this are unknown. Chewing off the whiskers
of another cat is not a behavior commonly seen with allogrooming, but
 other than the loss of the whiskers, it is probably a harmless activity.
Occasionally, cats are reported to even chew on their own whiskers.
 Although alopecia is not a common side effect of chemotherapy in
 cats, it does often result in whisker loss. This is most often associated
with antitumor antibiotics, such as mitoxantrone and doxorubicin. See
Figure 328-2. Whiskers will usually (but not always) regrow weeks to
 months after discontinuation of therapy. However, the new vibrissae
may be more coarse and of a different color than the original whiskers.

Fammiliarize yourself and your staff about zoonotic issues.
Discuss the health risks and benefits of cat ownership with your clients; help them decide the management needed.
Inform public health authorities if a reportable zoonotic disease is diagnosed.
Clinical actions
Vaccinate all cats against rabies.
Routinely administer monthly heartworm preventative in endemic areas.
Routinely administer monthly taeniacides to cats allowed outdoor in areas endemic for Echinococcus muftifocufaris.
Test all cats for gastrointestinal parasites at least once yearly.
Recommend a diagnostic workup when a disease with zoonotic potential is likely.
Offer the following diagnostics for all cats with 1-2 days diarrhea and for cats owned by immunosuppressed individuals:
1. Zinc sulfate centrifugation and microscopic evaluation for oocysts, cyst, and eggs.
2. Fecal wet mount to evaluate trophozoites of Giardia spp. and Fitrichomonas spp.
 3. Rectal cytology to look for white blood cells and spirochetes consistent with Campyobacter spp.
4. Cryptosporidium spp. screening by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), or acid-fast stain.
