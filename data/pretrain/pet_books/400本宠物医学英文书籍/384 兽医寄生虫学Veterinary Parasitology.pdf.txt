Introduction
Unlike previous editions, parasites are now organised under the hosts and
organ systems in which they are found. As many parasites have features in
common, the first chapter of this book provides a background to the
taxonomic classification and common morphological features of the many
groups of parasites found in domestic animals. More detailed individual
descriptions are then provided under the respective host chapters.
Throughout the book extensive indexing and cross-referencing are
provided both in the overview that follows, and at the end of each host
         
are now grouped in a separate chapter, Chapter 11: Facultative parasites
and arthropod vectors.
Further general chapters are provided on The epidemiology of parasitic
diseases (Chapter 12); Resistance to parasitic diseases (Chapter 13);
Antiparasitics (Chapter 14); and The laboratory diagnosis of parasitism
(Chapter 15)

Foreword to the first edition
This book is intended for students of veterinary parasitology, for
practising veterinarians and for others requiring information on some
aspect of parasitic disease.
Originally intended as a modestly expanded version of the printed notes
issued to our students in the third and fourth years of the course, the text,
perhaps inevitably, has expanded. This was due to three factors. Firstly, a
gradual realization of the deficiencies in our notes; secondly, the necessity
of including some of the comments normally imparted during the lecture
course; and thirdly, at the suggestion of the publishers, to the inclusion of
course.
parasitic diseases of domestic animals. The most important of these
diseases have therefore been discussed in some detail, the less important
dealt with more briefly and the uncommon either omitted or given a brief
mention, Also, since details of classification are of limited value to the
veterinarian we have deliberately kept these to the minimum sufficient to
indicate the relationships between the various species. For a similar
reason, taxonomic detail is only presented at the generic level and,
occasionally, for certain parasites, at species level. We have also trod
lightly on some other areas such as, for example, the identification of
species of tropical ticks and the special significance and epidemiology of
some parasites of regional importance. In these cases, we feel that
instruction is best given by an expert aware of the significance of
particular species in that region.
Throughout the text we have generally referred to drugs by their chemical,
rather than proprietary, names because of the plethora of the latter
throughout the world. Also, because formulations are often different, we
have avoided stating doses; for these, reference should be made to the data
is recommended at an unusual dose, we have noted this in the text.
In the chapters at the end of the book we have attempted to review five
aspects  of   veterinary   parasitology,  epidemiology,   immunity,
20
anthelmintics, ectoparasiticides and laboratory diagnosis. We hope that
this broader perspective will be of value to students, and particularly to
those dismayed by the many complexities of the subject.
 o       nxn   s o  
chapter on diagnosis. This was decided with some regret and much relief
on the grounds that it would have meant the inclusion, in a book primarily
intended for undergraduates, of hundreds of references. We hope that
those of our colleagues throughout the world who recognize the results of
their work in the text will accept this by way of explanation and apology.
We would, however, like to acknowledge our indebtedness to the authors
of several source books on veterinary parasitology whose work we have
frequently consulted. These include Medical and Veterinary Protozoology
by Adam,Paul & Zaman,Veterinaermedizinische Parasitologieby Boch
& Supperer, Dunn's Veterinary Heiminthology, Euzeby's Les Maladies
Vermineuses des Animaux Domestiques,Georgi’'s Parasitology for
Veterinarians, Reinecke's Veterinary Heiminthology, Service's A Guide
to Medicai Entomology and Soulsby's Heiminths, Arthropods and
ProtozoaofDomesticatedAnimais.
Any student seeking further information on specific topics should consult
these or, alternatively, ask his or her tutor for a suitable review.
The ennui associated with repeated proofreading may occasionally (we
hope, rarely) have led to some errors in the text. Notification of these
would be welcomed by the authors. Finally we hope that the stresses
endured by each of us in this collaborative venture will be more than
offset by its value to readers.

Foreword and acknowledgements to the second edition
The first edition of this book was published in 1987 and the authors
considered that a second edition is now necessary for several reasons.
Firstly, the widespread use of drugs such as avermectins and milbemycins.
which have had a significant effect on anthelmintic prophylaxis and
control. At the time of the first edition only one, ivermectin, was marketed
whereas at the present time there are now several such products.
supplemented by a number of new, long-acting chemoprophylactic
devices.
Secondly, in many countries the production of a number of older
anthelmintics and insecticides has largely ceased or many are difficult to
find.
Thirdly, several parasitic diseases have now been described, about which
little was known at the time of the first edition. Notably these are
neosporosis and Lyme disease. Also included is a short description of the
nasal mite of dogs, Pneumonyssus caninum, kindly provided by Professor
Arvid Uggla of The National Veterinary Institute and Swedish University
of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.
Fourthly, we have taken the opportunity of rewriting some parts of the
text, which on reflection, were less clear than we had hoped. In many
cases, this has been supplemented by new diagrams or photographs.
Another change in this edition is the adoption of the standardized
nomenclature of animal parasitic diseases (SNOAPAD) proposed by an
expert committee appointed by the World Association for  the
Advancement  of Veterinary  Parasitology  (WAAVP) published   in
Veterinary Parasitology (1988) 29, 299-326. Although this may have a
animal parasitic diseases for many years, it is designed to improve the
clarity of scientific communication by the general use of uniform
terminology and should, in the long term, prove particularly beneficial in
facilitating the retrieval of computerized data related to veterinary
parasitology.
At the end of the book we have given a list of books and journals, which

greater detail. This is confined to publications, which are readily available
in most libraries of universities and research institutes.
We wish to thank Drs Ken Bairden, Quintin McKellar and Jacqueline
McKeand for helpful comments on the text, also Mr Stuart Brown who
assisted in the preparation of some of the new illustrations and Una B.
Shanks RsW who prepared all of the new drawings.
We should mention, with great regret, the death of our co-author Dr
Angus M. Dunn, who died in 1991 before this review was started, but we

we have made.
At the start of this revision we had intended to include new sections on
parasitic disease of both fish and laboratory animals. However, a
subsequent review of the literature currently available on these two
subjects indicated that both were adequately covered in existing
publications and it seemed more sensible to include the titles of these in
the list of suggested reading.
Finally we wish to express our appreciation of the reception accorded to
the first edition by reviewers, colleagues and students; we hope this
second edition will be equally well received.

Foreword to the third edition
On behalf of the original authors of the first and second editions of
authors responsible for the third edition, which has expanded considerably
from the previous two in order to include new areas of interest in the
subject at local, national and international levels.
It is worth reflecting that the first edition was essentially a written and
illustratedexpansion of the printed notes issued to undergraduate
veterinary students at the University of Glasgow. These notes very much
mirrored the research interests of the staff within the Department of
       
branch of the subject, and to a lesser extent the protozoology and
entomology components. Understandably this bias was reflected in the
first edition, which was aimed at a readership of veterinary undergraduates
and practising veterinary surgeons.
diseases, the main change was the adoption of the standardised
nomenclature of animal parasitic diseases (SNAOPAD) proposed by an
expert committee of the World Association for the Advancement of
Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP).
By the time edition three was sought there was a clamour from the ever
expanding population of those interested in the subject to produce a book
that was not only suitable for students and practitioners but also provided
more detailed information required by those researching the subject
whether in academia, government institutions or industry.
This was a difficult task to undertake but the current authors have
managed to produce a well illustrated text suitable for those studying and
researching the subject. I particularly liked the re-vamped sections on
entomology and protozoology and the updating of that on helminthology.
The new chapters on parasites of laboratory animals and exotic pets were
needed and the highlighting of zoonotic potential, where appropriate, was
a welcome feature.

colleagues at Glasgow.

I am sure the new edition will command great interest and respect from
the international community of veterinary students, researchers and
practitioners.

Preface and acknowledgements to the third edition
which includes teachers and students in veterinary schools, research
groups in universities and institutes, veterinarians in practice and in
government service and others who are involved in aspects of parasitic
disease. In producing the new edition of Veterinary Parasitology the
authors had several aims.
The first was to preserve the spirit of the first and second editions, which
had been compiled by eminent and respected veterinary parasitologists in
their field and which provided a solid background on which to
consolidate.
The second aim was to expand the sections on protozoa and ectoparasites
and to incorporate a larger selection of parasites, which are of veterinary
significance in other parts of the world. The book focuses mainly on core
information relating to parasites of livestock and companion animals but
new sections on parasites of poultry and gamebirds, laboratory animals.
      s ,   
parasitic diseases are now covered in detail using a standardised format
for each parasite to allow easy referencing and for comparison between
species within a genus. Where appropriate, reference is made to human
infections where there is natural transmission of parasitic disease between
vertebrate animals and man (zoonoses).
The third aim was to present the information in a format which is
compatible with the current parasitology teaching modules used within
many university veterinary schools. This inevitably has had to be a
compromise, as approaches to teaching veterinary parasitology differ
throughout the world, but, by arranging the parasites under host species
and their predilection site within the host and providing a comprehensive
check list for each section and extensive cross-referencing, it is hoped that

parasite orders and families. Additional detailed sections are provided at
laboratory diagnosis, including numerous tables and identification charts.

Parasite taxonomy and
morphology
PRINCIPLESOFCLASSIFICATION
When examined, living organisms can be seen to form natural groups with
features in common. These similarities may be morphological, but
increasingly may be based on DNA analysis. Groups of organisms are
combined into biologically meaningful groups, usually attempting to
represent evolutionary pathways. A group of this sort is called a taxon,
and the study of this aspect of biology is called taxonomy. The study of
the complex systems of inter-relationship between living organisms is
called systematics.
The taxa into which organisms may be placed are recognised by
international agreement; the primary ones are: kingdom, phylum, class,
order, family, genus and species. The intervals between these are large,
and some organisms cannot be allocated to them precisely, so intermediate
taxa, prefixed appropriately, have been formed; examples of these are the
suborder and the superfamily. As an example, the taxonomic status of
one of the common abomasal parasites of ruminants may be expressed as
shownbelow

Class NEMATODA
A system of classification of nematodes of veterinary importance is given
in Table 1.1. It must be emphasised that this is not an exact expression of
intended for use in the study of veterinary parasitology. It is based on the
ten superfamilies in which nematodes of veterinary importance occur, and
which are conveniently divided into bursate and non-bursate groups.
STRUCTUREANDFUNCTION
Most nematodes have a cylindrical form, tapering at either end, and the
body is covered by a colourless, somewhat translucent, layer: the cuticle.
The cuticle is secreted by the underlying hypodermis, which projects into
the body cavity forming two lateral cords, which carry the excretory
canals, and a dorsal and ventral cord carrying the nerves (Fig. 1.1). The
muscle cells, arranged longitudinally, lie between the hypodermis and the
body cavity. The latter contains fluid at a high pressure, which maintains
the turgidity and shape of the body. Locomotion is effected by undulating
waves of muscle contraction and relaxation that alternate on the dorsal and
     o    go s gs
and suspended in the fluid-filled body cavity (Fig. 1.1).

The digestive system is tubular (Fig. 1.2a). The mouth of many
nematodes is a simple opening, which may be surrounded by two or three
lips, and leads directly into the oesophagus. In others, such as the
strongyloids, it is large, and opens into a buccal capsule, which may
contain teeth. Such parasites, when feeding, draw a plug of mucosa into
the buccal capsule, where it is broken down by the action of enzymes,
          a s
worms may also secrete anticoagulant, and small vessels, ruptured in the
digestion of the mucosal plug, may continue to bleed for some minutes
after the worm has moved to a fresh site
Those with very small buccal capsules, like the trichostrongyloids, or
simple oral openings, like the ascaridoids, generally feed on mucosal
fluid, products of host digestion and cell debris, while others, such as the
oxyuroids, appear to scavenge on the contents of the lower gut. Worms
living in the bloodstream or tissue spaces, such as the filarioids, feed
exclusively on body fluids.

The oesophagus is usually muscular and pumps food into the intestine. It
is of variable form (Fig. 1.3), and is a useful preliminary identification
character for groups of worms. It may be filariform, simple and slightly
thickened posteriorly, as in the bursate nematodes; bulb-shaped, with a
large posterior swelling, as in the ascaridoids; or double bulb-shaped, as
in the oxyuroids. In some groups this wholly muscular form does not
occur: the filarioids and spiruroids have a muscular-glandular
oesophagus which is muscular anteriorly, the posterior part being
glandular; the trichuroid oesophagus has a capillary form, passing
through a single column of cells, the whole being known as a stichosome.
 A rhabditiform oesophagus, with slight anterior and posterior swellings,
is present in the preparasitic larvae of many nematodes, and in adult
free-living nematodes.
The intestine is a tube whose lumen is enclosed by a single layer of cells
or by a syncytium. The luminal surfaces possess microvilli, which
increase the absorptive capacity of the cells. In female worms the intestine
terminates in an anus, while in males there is a cloaca which functions as
an anus, and into which opens the vas deferens and through which the
copulatory spicules may be extruded.
The so-called 'excretory system’ is very primitive, consisting of a canal
within each lateral cord joining at the excretory pore in the oesophageal
region.
37
The reproductive systems consist of filamentous tubes. The female
 organs comprise ovary, oviduct and uterus, which may be paired, ending
in a common short vagina, which opens at the vulva (Fig. 1.2b). At the
junction of uterus and vagina in some species there is a short muscular
organ, the ovejector, which assists in egg laying. A vulval flap may also
be present.

trichostrongyloids, the two most important being the spicules and
38
gubernaculum (Fig. l.4). The spicules are chitinous organs, usually
paired, which are inserted in the female genital opening during copulation.
The gubernaculum, also chitinous, is a small structure, which acts as a
guide for the spicules. With the two sexes in close apposition the
amoeboid sperm are transferred from the cloaca of the male into the uterus
of the female.
The cuticle may be modified to form various structures (Figs l.5a and
1.5b), the more important of which are:
Leaf crowns consisting of rows of papillae occurring as fringes round the
rim of the buccal capsule (external leaf crowns) or just inside the rim
(internal leaf crowns). They are especially prominent in certain nematodes
of horses. Their function is not known, but it is suggested that they may be
used to pin a patch of mucosa in position during feeding, or that they may
prevent the entry of foreign matter into the buccal capsule when the worm
has detached from the mucosa.

Cervical papillae occur anteriorly in the oesophageal region, and caudal
papillae posteriorly at the tail. They are spine-like or finger-like
sensory or supportive.
Cervical and caudal alae are flattened wing-like expansions of the cuticle
in the oesophageal and tail regions.
Cephalic and cervical vesicles are inflations of the cuticle around the
The copulatory bursa, which embraces the female during copulation, is
important in the identification of certain male nematodes and is derived
from much expanded caudal alae, which are supported by elongated
caudal papillae called bursal rays. It consists of two lateral lobes and a
single small dorsal lobe.
Plaques and cordons are plate-like and cord-like ornamentations present
on the cuticle of many nematodes of the superfamily Spiruroidea.
BASICNEMATODELIFECYCLE
In the Nematoda, the sexes are separate and the males are generally
smaller than the females, which lay eggs or larvae. During development, a
nematode moults at intervals, shedding its cuticle. In the complete life
cycle there are four moults, the successive larval stages being designated
L1, L2, L3, L4 and finally L5, which is the immature adult.

One feature of the basic nematode life cycle is that immediate transfer of
infection from one final host to another rarely occurs. Some development
usually takes place either in the faecal pat or in a different species of
animal, the intermediate host, before infection can take place.
In the common form of direct life cycle, the free-living larvae undergo
two moults after hatching and infection is by ingestion of the free L3.
There are some important exceptions however, infection sometimes being
by larval penetration of the skin or by ingestion of the egg containing a
larva.
[n indirect life cycles, the first two moults usually take place in an
intermediate host and infection of the final host is either by ingestion of
the intermediate host or by inoculation of the L3 when the intermediate
host, such as a blood-sucking insect, feeds.
After infection, two further moults take place to produce the L5 or
immature adult parasite. Following copulation a further life cycle is
initiated.
In the case of gastrointestinal parasites, development may take place
entirely in the gut lumen or with only limited movement into the mucosa.
However, in many species, the larvae travel considerable distances

emphasised that the above is a basic description of nematode life cycles
and that there are many variations.
DEVELOPMENTOFTHEPARASITE
EGG
Nematode eggs differ greatly in size and shape, and the shell is of variable
thickness, usually consisting of three layers.
42
The inner membrane, which is thin, has lipid characteristics and is
impermeable. A middle layer, which is tough and chitinous gives rigidity
and, when thick, imparts a yellowish colour to the egg. In many species
this layer is interrupted at one or both ends with an operculum (lid) or
plug. The third outer layer consists of protein, which is very thick and
sticky in the ascaridoids and is important in the epidemiology of this
superfamily.
In contrast, in some species the eggshell is very thin and may be merely
present as a sheath around the larva.
The survival potential of the egg outside the body varies, but appears to be
connected with the thickness of the shell, which protects the larva from

ground.

Outside the body, hatching is controlled partly by factors such as
temperature and moisture and partly by the larva itself. In the process of
 p  i  ls n   
enzymes secreted by the larva and by its own movement. The larva is then
able to take up water from the environment and enlarges to rupture the
remaining layers and escape.
When the larvated egg is the infective form, the host initiates hatching
the process. It is important for each nematode species that hatching should
although it appears that dissolved carbon dioxide is a constant essential.
Three of the important superfamilies, the trichostrongyloids, the
strongyloids and the rhabditoids, have a completely free-living
preparasitic phase. The first two larval stages usually feed on bacteria, but
43
the L3, sealed off from the environment by the retained cuticle of the L2,
cannot feed and must survive on the stored nutrients acquired in the early
stages. Growth of the larva is interrupted during moulting by periods of
lethargus in which it neither feeds nor moves.
The cuticle of the L2 is retained as a sheath around the L3; this is

temperature and humidity. The optimal temperature for the development
of the maximum number of larvae in the shortest feasible time is generally
in the range 18-26°C. At higher temperatures, development is faster and
the larvae are hyperactive, thus depleting their lipid reserves. The
mortality rate then rises, so that few will survive to L3. As the temperature
falls the process slows, and below 10°℃ the development from egg to L3
usually cannot take place. Below 5°C movement and metabolism of L3 is
minimal, which in many species favours survival.
The optimal humidity is 100%, although some development can occur
down to 80% relative humidity. It should be noted that even in dry
weather where the ambient humidity is low, the microclimate in faeces or
at the soil surface may be sufficiently humid to permit continuing larval
development.
In the trichostrongyloids and strongyloids, the embryonated egg and the
ensheathed L3 are best equipped to survive in adverse conditions such as
freezing or desiccation; in contrast, the L1 and L2 are particularly
vulnerable. Although desiccation is generally considered to be the most
lethal influence in larval survival, there is increasing evidence that by
entering a state of anhydrobiosis, certain larvae can survive severe
desiccation.
On the ground most larvae are active; although they require a film of

INFECTION
   o        s
and this occurs in the majority of trichostrongyloid and strongyloid
nematodes. In these, the L3 sheds the retained sheath of the L2 within the
alimentary tract of the host, the stimulus for exsheathment being provided
by the host in a manner similar to the hatching stimulus required by
egg-infective nematodes. In response to this stimulus the larva releases its
own exsheathing fluid, containing an enzyme leucine aminopeptidase,
which dissolves the sheath from within, either at a narrow collar anteriorly
so that a cap detaches, or by splitting the sheath longitudinally. The larva
can then wriggle free of the sheath.
  l  o   d a  
development is interrupted by two moults, each of these occurring during
a short period of lethargus.
The time taken for development from infection until mature adult parasites
are producing eggs or larvae is known as the prepatent period and this is
of known duration for each nematode species.
METABOLISM
The main food reserve of preparasitic nematode larvae, whether inside the
egg shell or free-living, is lipid, which may be seen as droplets in the
lumen of the intestine. The infectivity of these stages is often related to the
amount present; larvae which have depleted their reserves are not as
infective as those which still retain quantities of lipid.
   s    e s a  
most nematodes feed on bacteria. However, once they reach the infective
third stage, they are sealed in the retained cuticle of the second stage,
cannot feed and are completely dependent on their stored reserves.
In contrast, the adult parasite stores its energy as glycogen, mainly in the
lateral cords and muscles, and this may constitute 20% of the dry weight
of the worm.
Free-living and developing stages of nematodes usually have an aerobic
metabolism, whereas adult nematodes can metabolise carbohydrate by
45
both glycolysis (anaerobic) and oxidative decarboxylation (aerobic).
However, in the latter, pathways may operate which are not present in the
host and it is at this level that some antiparasitic drugs operate.
The oxidation of carbohydrates requires the presence of an electron
transport system, which in most nematodes can operate aerobically down
to oxygen tensions of 5.0 mmHg or less. Since the oxygen tension at the
mucosal surface of the intestine is around 20 mmHg, nematodes in close
proximity to the mucosa normally have sufficient oxygen for aerobic
metabolism. Otherwise, if the nematode is temporarily or permanently
some distance from the mucosal surface, energy metabolism is probably
largely anaerobic.

The end products of the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats or proteins are
excreted through the anus or cloaca, or by diffusion through the body wall.
Ammonia, the terminal product of protein metabolism, must be excreted
rapidly and diluted to nontoxic levels in the surrounding fluids. During
periods of anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism, the worms may also
excrete pyruvic acid rather than retaining it for future oxidation when
aerobic metabolism is possible.
The ‘excretory system’ terminating in the excretory pore is almost
certainly not concerned with excretion, but rather with osmoregulation and
salt balance.
Two phenomena which affect the normal parasitic life cycle of nematodes
and which are of considerable biological and epidemiological importance
are arrested larval development and the periparturient rise in faecal
egg counts.
46
ARRESTEDLARVAL
DEVELOPMENT
(synonyms: inhibited larval development, hypobiosis) This phenomenon
at a precise point in its parasitic development. It is usually a facultative
characteristic and affects only a proportion of the worm population. Some
strains of nematodes have a high propensity for arrested development
while in others this is low.
Conclusive evidence for the occurrence of arrested larval development can
Only be obtained by examination of the worm population in the host. It is
usually recognised by the presence of large numbers of larvae at the same
stage of development in animals withheld from infection for a period
longer than that required to reach that particular larval stage.
The nature of the stimulus for arrested development and for the
subsequent maturation of the larvae is still a matter of debate. Although
there are apparently different circumstances which initiate arrested larval
development, most commonly the stimulus is an environmental one
1 a  i   ss i  a  i
may be seen as a ruse by the parasite to avoid adverse climatic conditions
for its progeny by remaining sexually immature in the host until more
favourable conditions return. The name commonly applied to this seasonal
arrestment is hypobiosis. Thus the accumulation of arrested larvae often
coincides with the onset of cold autumn/winter conditions in the northern
hemisphere, or very dry conditions in the subtropics or tropics. In contrast.
the maturation of these larvae coincides with the return of environmental
conditions suitable to their free-living development, although it is not
clear what triggers the signal to mature and how it is transmitted.
The degree of adaptation to these seasonal stimuli and therefore the
proportion of larvae which do become arrested seems to be a heritable trait
and is affected by various factors, including grazing systems and the
degree of adversity in the environment. For example, in Canada where the
winters are severe, most trichostrongyloid larvae ingested in late autumn
winters, about 50-60% are arrested. In the humid tropics where free-living
47
larval development is possible all the year round, relatively few become
arrested.
However, arrested development may also occur as a result of both
acquired and age immunity in the host and, although the proportions of
larvae arrested are not usually so high as in hypobiosis, they can play an
important part in the epidemiology of nematode infections. Maturation of
these arrested larvae seems to be linked with the breeding cycle of the host
and occurs at or around parturition.
The epidemiological importance of arrested larval development from
whatever cause is that, first, it ensures the survival of the nematode during
periods of adversity; secondly, the subsequent maturation of arrested
larvae increases the contamination of the environment and can sometimes
result in clinical disease.
PERIPARTURIENTRISE(PPR)IN
FAECAL EGG COUNTS
(Synonyms: post-parturient rise, spring rise.)
This refers to an increase in the numbers of nematode eggs in the faeces of
animals around parturition.
This phenomenon is most marked in ewes, goats and sows and recent data
supports the hypothesis that there is competition between the immune
system, the rapidly growing fetus in late pregnancy and the udder during
lactation, for nutrients, particularly metabolisable protein. This relaxation
of immunity can be largely restored by supplementation with
rumen-undegradable protein and is also influenced by the body protein
status of the ewe.
The source of the PPR is three-fold
(1) Maturation of larvae arrested due to host immunity
  n  o s sn  (
pastures and a reduced turnover of existing adult infections.
(3) An increased fecundity of existing adult worm populations
48
Contemporaneously, but not associated with the relaxation of host
immunity, the PPR may be augmented by the maturation of hypobiotic
larvae.
The importance of the PPR is that it occurs at a time when the numbers of
new susceptible hosts are increasing and so ensures the survival and
propagation of the worm species. Depending on the magnitude of
infection, it may also cause a loss of production in lactating animals and,
by contamination of the environment, lead to clinical disease in
susceptible young stock.
NEMATODESUPERFAMILIES
Superfamily TRICHOSTRONGYLOIDEA
The trichostrongyloids are small, often hair-like, worms in the bursate
group, which, with the exception of the lungworm Dictyocaufus, parasitise
the alimentary tract of animals and birds. Structurally they have few
cuticular appendages and the buccal capsule is vestigial. The males have a
well developed bursa and two spicules, the configuration of which is used
for species differentiation. The life cycle is direct and usually
non-migratory and the ensheathed L3 is the infective stage.
The trichostrongyloids, including Dictyocaulus, are responsible for
considerable mortality and widespread morbidity, especially in ruminants.
The most important alimentary genera are Ostertagia, Teladorsagia,
Haemonchus,Trichostrongylus,Cooperia,Nematodirus,Hyostrongylus,
Marshallagia and Mecistocirrus. Other genera of lesser importance are
Amidostomum, Ollulanus, Ornithostrongylus and Impalaia.
Superfamily STRONGYLOIDEA
There are several important parasites of domestic mammals and birds in
this superfamily of bursate nematodes.
Most are characterised by a large buccal capsule, which often contains
teeth or cutting plates, and in some there are prominent leaf crowns
surrounding the mouth opening. The adults occur on mucosal surfaces of
ingestion of plugs of mucosa.
49
With the exception of three genera, Syngamus, Mammomonogamus and
Stephanurus found in the peri-renal area, all other genera of veterinary
conveniently divided into two groups, the strongyles and hookworms.
The strongyles are parasitic in the large intestine and the important genera
are Strongylus, Triodontophorus, Chabertia and Oesophagostomum. The
cyathostomins (cyathostomes or trichonemes) of horses include the genera
Cyathostomum, Cylicocyclus, Cylicodontophorus and Cylicostephanus
Syngamus and Cyathostoma are important parasites of the respiratory tract
of birds. Mammomonogamus are parasites of the respiratory tract of cattle,
sheep and goats.
Superfamily ANCYLOSTOMATOIDEA
Hookworms are parasites of the small intestine and the genera of
lesser extent, Gaigeria and Agriostomum.
In humans important hookworm genera are Ancylostoma and Necator.
SuperfamilyMETASTRONGYLOIDEA
Most worms in this superfamily inhabit the lungs or the blood vessels
adjacent to the lungs. The typical life cycle is indirect, and the
intermediate host is usually a mollusc.
They may be conveniently divided into three groups according to host:
those occurring in pigs (Metastrongylus), in sheep and goats (Muellerius,
Protostrongyius, Cystocaufus, Spiculocauius and Neostrongyius), and in
the domestic and wild carnivores (Oslerus, Filaroides, Aelurostrongyfus,
Angiostrongylus,Crenosoma,Anafilaroides,Metathelazia and Guritia).
Elaphostrongylus occurs in deer in Europe; Parelaphostrongylus occurs in
deer and camelids in North America.
50
Superfamily RHABDITOIDEA
This is a primitive group of nematodes which are mostly free-living, or
parasitic in lower vertebrates and invertebrates. Although a few normally
free-living genera such as Halicephalobus (Micronema) and Rhabditis
occasionally cause problems in animals, the only important genus from
the veterinary point of view is Strongyloides.
Superfamily ASCARIDOIDEA
The ascaridoids are among the largest nematodes and occur in most
domestic animals, both larval and adult stages being of veterinary
importance. While the adults in the intestine may cause unthriftiness in
young animals, and occasional obstruction, an important feature of the
group is the pathological consequences of the migratory behaviour of the
larval stages.
With a few exceptions the genera have the following characters in
common. They are large, white opaque worms, which inhabit the small
intestine. There is no buccal capsule, the mouth consisting simply of a
small opening surrounded by three lips. The common mode of infection is
by ingestion of the thick-shelled egg containing the L2. However, the
cycle may involve transport and paratenic hosts.
Genera of veterinary interest are Ascaris, Toxocara, Toxascaris,
Parascaris, Ascaridia, Heterakis and to a lesser extent the anisakids
(Anisakis,Contracaecum,Hysterothylacium, Pseudoterranova,
Angusticaecum)
Superfamily OXYUROIDEA
Adult oxyuroids of animals inhabit the large intestine and are commonly
called pinworms because of the pointed tail of the female parasite. They
have a double bulb oesophagus and a direct life cycle. The genera of
veterinary interest are Oxyuris and Probstmayria, both parasitic in the
horse; Skrjabinema, which is a parasite of ruminants; Paraspidodera in
-Anod jo saseed aue yotum (eapiounnqns) nuninqns pue said eauing
Oxyurids include the common human pinworm, Enterobius.
51
SuperfamilySPIRUROIDEA
The precise classification of a number of genera currently assigned to this
superfamily is controversial, but there are some of significance in
veterinary medicine: Spirocerca, Habronema, Draschia, Parabronema
Thelazia, Gnathostoma, Gongylonema and to a lesser extent Ascarops,
Physocephaius,Simondsia,Physaloptera,Spirura,Echinuria,
Dispharynx,Tetrameres, Streptocara, Cheilospirura, Histiocephaius,
Hartertia and Oxyspirura. A major characteristic of this group is the tight
spirally coiled tail of the male. The life cycles are indirect involving
arthropod intermediate hosts.
Members of the genus Thelazia are principally found in or around the eyes
of animals and can be responsible for keratitis. Unlike most spiruroids, the
L1 stage is not ingested from the faeces, but by flies feeding on ocular
secretions.
The genus Gongyfonema is unusual among the spiruroids in having a very
wide final host range, which includes all the domesticated animals, though
it is most prevalent in ruminants. Like most spiruroids the favoured
location of the adults is in the upper alimentary tract, in the oesophagus,
and in the forestomachs and stomach of mammals and the crop of birds.
Superfamily FILARIOIDEA
This superfamily is closely related to the Spiruroidea and, as in the latter,
all its genera have indirect life cycles. None of them inhabits the
 d   o     
more primitive forms laying eggs, which are available to the vectors in
dermal exudates, and the more highly evolved forms laying larvae, termed
microfilariae. The latter, which may be enclosed in a flexible, sheath-like
'egg shell’ are taken up by parasitic insects feeding on blood and tissue
blood and tissues at regular intervals, some appearing in the daytime and
others at night; this behaviour is termed diurnal or nocturnal periodicity
Genera of  interest  in veterinary medicine include Parafiliaria,
Stephanofilaria,Dirofilaria,Dipetalonema,Onchocerca,Setaria,
Elaeophora, Ornithofilaria and Pelecitus. Of greater importance in human
52
medicine are the genera Onchocera, Brugia, Loa, Wuchereria and
Mansonella.
FILARIOSISINMAN
Though they are probably the most important group of helminth infections
in humans, filarioid nematodes are of only marginal concern to the
veterinarian, since domestic animals are of little significance in their
epidemiology. The following are the most important species in man:
1. Onchocerca volvulus. Human onchocercosis due to O. volvulus

most important species, B. malayi, is also infective for monkeys and
    s m

man, B. pahangi, has a reservoir in many species of domestic and
wild animals, including the dog and cat. Adult parasites inhabit
lymph nodes and afferent lymphatic vessels.
3. Wuchereria bancrofti is also mosquito borne and affects the
lymphatic system causing elephantiasis in Africa, Asia and South
America. It is exclusive to man. As with Brugia spp, the main

pathogenic effects are associated with adult worms rather than with
microfilariae.
4. Loa loa is transmitted by Chrysops spp (tabanid flies), and occurs
in west, central and east Africa, where it causes the transient
subcutaneous enlargements known as 'Calabar swellings'. It is
confined to man, apes and monkeys. Longevity can be up to 20
years.

associated with allergic signs. The prevalence is extremely high in
endemic areas, where parasites closely resembling M. ozzardi are
commonly found in monkeys and in horses and cattle. There is,
however, reluctance to presume that these animals may be reservoir
hosts until positive identification is made.
Superfamily TRICHUROIDEA
The members of this superfamily are found in a wide variety of domestic
animals.A common morphological feature is the‘stichosome’oesophagus
that is composed of a capillary-like tube surrounded by a single column of
cells.
There are three genera of interest. The first, Trichuris, is found in the
caecum and colon of mammals; the second, Capillaria, is most commonly
present in the alimentary or respiratory tract of mammals or birds. Both
lay eggs with plugs at both poles. The adults of the third genus,
Trichineila, are found in the small intestine of mammals and produce
larvae, which immediately invade the tissues of the same host.
Superfamily DIOCTOPHYMATOIDEA
Species of veterinary interest in this superfamily are the *kidney worm'
Dioctophyma renale; Hystrichis and Eustrongylides occur in aquatic fowl.
54
Superfamily DRACUNCULOIDEA
Members of this superfamily are parasites of the subcutaneous tissues.
The two genera of  veterinary  significance are Dracunculus and
Avioserpens. The life cycle involves development in a species of Cyclops
before becoming infective to the final host
Phylum ACANTHOCEPHALA
This is a separate class, closely related to the Nematoda, which contains a
few genera of veterinary importance. They are generally referred to as
'thornyheaded worms’ due to the presence of a hook-covered proboscis
anteriorly, and most are parasites of the alimentary tract of vertebrates.
The hollow proboscis armed with recurved hooks, which aid in
attachment, is retractable and lies in a sac. There is no alimentary canal,
with absorption taking place through the thick cuticle, which is often
folded and invaginated to increase the absorptive surface. The sexes are
separate, males being much smaller than females. Posteriorly, the male
has a muscular bursa and penis and, after copulation, eggs, discharged by
ovaries into the body cavity of the female, are fertilised and taken up by a
complex structure called the uterine bell, which only allows mature eggs
to pass out. These are spindleshaped, thick-shelled and contain a larva
which has an anterior circlet of hooks and spines on its surface and is
called an acanthor. The life cycle is indirect, involving either an aquatic
Or terrestrial arthropod intermediate host. On ingestion by the intermediate
host, the egg hatches and the acanthor migrates to the haemocoel of the
arthropod where it develops to become a cystacanth after 1-3 months.
The definitive host is infected by ingestion of the arthropod intermediate
host, and the cystacanth, which is really a young adult, attaches and grows
to maturity in the alimentary canal. The prepatent period varies from 5-12
weeks.
FamilyOLIGACANTHORHYNCHIDAE
The major genus of veterinary significance is Macracanthorhynchus,
which is found in pigs.
55
Family POLYMORPHIDAE
A few genera are parasites of rodents (Moniliformis) aquatic birds
(Polymorphus, Filicollis) and fishes (Echinorhynchus, Acanthocephaius)
Phylum PLATYHELMINTHES
This phylum contains the two classes of parasitic flatworms, the
Trematoda and the Cestoda.
ClassTREMATODA
The class Trematoda falls into two main subclasses, the Monogenea,
which have a direct life cycle, and the Digenea, which require an
intermediate host. The former are found mainly as external parasites of
fish, while the latter are found exclusively in vertebrates and are of
considerable veterinary importance.
The adult digenetic trematodes, commonly called “flukes', occur primarily
in the bile ducts, alimentary tract and vascular system. Most flukes are
flattened dorsoventrally, have a blind alimentary tract, suckers for
attachment and are hermaphrodite. Depending on the predilection site, the
eggs pass out of the final host, usually in faeces or urine, and the larval
stages develop in a molluscan intermediate host. For a few species, a
second intermediate host is involved, but the mollusc is essential for all
members of the group.
There are many families in the class Trematoda, and those which include
parasites  of  major    veterinary importance   are  the   Fasciolidae,
Dicrocoeliidae, Paramphistomidae and Schistosomatidae. Of lesser
importance are the Troglotrematidae and Opisthorchiidae.The most
important group by far are the Fasciolidae and the discussion below of
structure, function, and life cycle is largely orientated towards this group.

Subclass DIGENEA
STRUCTUREANDFUNCTIONOF
DIGENETICTREMATODES
The adult possesses two muscular suckers for attachment. The oral sucker
at the anterior end surrounds the mouth, and the ventral sucker, as the
name indicates, is on that surface. The body surface is a tegument, which
is absorptive and is often covered with spines. The muscles lie
immediately below the tegument. There is no body cavity and the organs
are packed in a parenchyma (Fig. 1.6).

The trematodes are usually hermaphrodite and both cross- and
pair of testes each leading into a vas deferens; these join to enter the cirrus
sac containing a seminal vesicle and the cirrus, a primitive penis which
terminates at the common genital opening (Fig. 1.6). The female system
has a single ovary leading into an oviduct, which is expanded distally to
vitelline glands and ultimately a shell. As the egg passes along the uterus,
the shell becomes hardened and toughened and is finally extruded through
the genital opening adjacent to the ventral sucker. The mature egg is
anoperculum.
Food, generally blood or tissue debris, is ingested and passed into the
caeca where it is digested and absorbed. Metabolism appears to be
primarily anaerobic.
LIFECYCLEOFDIGENETIC
TREMATODES
The essential point of the life cycle is that whereas one nematode egg can
develop into only one adult, one trematode egg may eventually develop
into hundreds of adults. This is due to the phenomenon of asexual
multiplication, parthenogony, in the molluscan intermediate host, i.e. the
production of new individuals by single larval forms.
The adult flukes are always oviparous and lay eggs with an operculum or
lid at one pole. In the egg the embryo develops into a pyriform
(pear-shaped), ciliated larva called a miracidium. Under the stimulus of
light, the miracidium releases an enzyme, which attacks the proteinaceous
cement holding the operculum in place. The latter springs open like a
hinged lid and the miracidium emerges within a few minutes.
The miracidium, propelled through the water by its cilia, does not fed and
must, for its further development, find a suitable snail within a few hours.
It is believed to use chemotactic responses to ‘home’ in on the snail and,
on contact, it adheres by suction to the snail and penetrates its soft tissues
aided by a cytolytic enzyme. The entire process of penetration takes about
30 minutes, after which the cilia are lost and the miracidium develops into
58
These cells develop into rediae, which migrate to the hepato-pancreas of
the snail; rediae are also larval forms possessing an oral sucker, some
flame cells and a simple gut. From the germinal cells of the rediae arise
the final stages, the cercariae, although if environmental conditions for
the snail are unsuitable, a second or daughter generation of rediae is often
produced instead. The cercariae, in essence young flukes with long tails,
emerge actively from the snail, usually in considerable numbers. The
actual stimulus for emergence depends on the species, but is most
commonly a change in temperature or light intensity. Once a snail is
infected, cercariae continue to be produced indefinitely, although the
majority of infected snails die prematurely from gross destruction of the
hepato-pancreas.
Typically the cercariae swim for some time, utilising even a film of water,
and within an hour or so attach themselves to vegetation, shed their tails
and encyst. This stage is called a metacercaria.
months. Once ingested, the outer cyst wall is removed mechanically
during mastication. Rupture of the inner cyst occurs in the intestine and
depends on a hatching mechanism, enzymatic in origin, triggered by a
suitable oxidation-reduction potential and a carbon dioxide system
provided by the intestinal environment. The emergent juvenile fluke then
penetrates the intestine and migrates to the predilection site where it

they are passed in the faeces; there is no redial stage during development

severe haemorrhagic enteritis of dogs, the so-called 'salmon poisoning'
This name is derived from the cycle of the fluke, which involves a water

Family CYCLOCOELIDAE
These are medium-sized to large fluke, parasites of aquatic birds in the
body cavity, air sacs or nasal cavities. Genera include Typhlocoelum in the
respiratory tract of ducks, and Hyptiasmus in the nasal and orbital sinuses
of ducks and geese.
FamilyOPISTHORCHDAE
The members of this family require two intermediate hosts, the first being
water snails and the second a wide variety of fish, in which the

Class CESTODA
This class differs from the Trematoda in having a tape-like body with no
alimentary canal. The body is segmented, each segment containing one
and sometimes two sets of male and female reproductive organs. Almost
allthe tapeworms of veterinaryimportance are in the order
Cyclophyllidea, the two exceptions being in the order Pseudophyllidea.

Order CYCLOPHYLLIDEA
STRUCTUREANDFUNCTION
The adult cestode (Fig. l.7) consists of a head or scolex bearing
attachment organs, a short unsegmented neck and a chain of segments.
The chain is known as a strobila and each segment as a proglottid.
The organs of attachment are four suckers on the sides of the scolex and
          
protrusible cone or rostellum and in some species this may be also armed
with one or more concentric rows of hooks, which aid in attachment.
The proglottids are continuously budded from the neck region and become
sexually mature as they pass down the strobila. Each proglottid is
hermaphrodite with one or two sets of reproductive organs, the genital
pores usually opening on the lateral margin or margins of the segment
(Fig. 1.8); both self-fertilisation and cross-fertilisation between proglottids

of the trematodes. As the segment matures, its internal structure largely
disappears and the fully ripe or gravid proglottid eventually contains only
remnants of the branched uterus packed with eggs. The gravid segments
are usually shed intact from the strobila and pass out with the faeces.
Outside the body the eggs are liberated by disintegration of the segment or
are shed through the genital pore.

The fully embryonated egg consists of:
(1) The hexacanth (six-hooked) embryo or oncosphere
(2) A thick, dark, radially striated *shell' called the embryophore.
(3) A true shell, which is a delicate membrane and is often lost
while still in the uterus.
65
The tegument of the adult tapeworm is highly absorptive, the worm
deriving all its nourishment through this structure. Below the tegument are
           
fills the space between the organs. The nervous system consists of ganglia
in the scolex from which nerves enter the strobila.The excretory system,
as in the Trematoda, is composed of flame cells leading to efferent canals,
which run through the strobila to discharge at the terminal segment.
LIFECYCLE
The typical life cycle of these cestodes is indirect with one or more
intermediate hosts. With few exceptions, the adult tapeworm is found in
the small intestine of the final host, the segments and eggs reaching the
exterior in the faeces.
When the egg is ingested by the intermediate host, the gastric and
intestinal secretions digest the embryophore and activate the oncosphere.
Using its hooks, it tears through the mucosa to reach the blood or lymph

predilection site the oncosphere loses its hooks and develops, depending
on the species, into one of the following larval stages, often known as
metacestodes (Fig. 1.9):

The seven main families of veterinary interest in the order Cyclophyllidea
are the Taeniidae, Anoplocephalidae, Dilepididae, Davaineidae,
Hymenolepididae,Mesocestoididae andThysanosomidae.
FamilyTAENlDAE
The adults are found in domestic carnivores and man. The scolex has an
armed rostellum with a concentric double row of hooks (the important
exception is Taenia saginata whose scolex is unarmed). The gravid
segments are longer than they are wide.
The intermediate stage is a cysticercus, strobilocercus, coenurus or
hydatid cyst and these occur only in mammals.
Genera of importance are Taenia (syn Multiceps) and Echinococcus.
Family ANOPLOCEPHALIDAE
These are essentially   tapeworms of horses  (Anoplocephaia,
Paranopiocephala) and ruminants (Moniezia). The scolex has neither
rostellum nor hooks and the gravid segments are wider than they are long.
The intermediate stage is a cysticercoid present in forage mites of the
family Oribatidae.
FamilyDILEPIDIDAE
These are tapeworms of the dog, cat (Dipylidium), and the fowl
(Amoebotaenia, Choanotaenia, Metroliasthes). The scolex usually has an
armed rostellum with several rows of hooks. The intermediate stage is a
cysticercoid.
68
Family DAVAINEIDAE
These are mainly parasites of birds (Davainea, Raillietina, Cotugnia)
 n   s o     
suckers. The intermediate stage is a cysticercoid
FamilyHYMENOLEPIDIDAE
These parasites are of minor veterinary importance. Members of this
family, which have a characteristically slender strobila, infect birds, man
and rodents (Hymenolepis, Rodentolepis, Fimbriaria). The intermediate
stage is a cysticercoid present in an arthropod host.
Family MESOCESTOIDIDAE
Also of minor veterinary importance, these cestodes of carnivorous
animals and birds have two metacestode stages. The first is a cysticercoid
in an insect or mite, and the second a solid larval form, a tetrathyridium, in
a vertebrate. Genera include Mesocestoides found in dogs, cats and wild
mammals, and Dithyridium in chickens, turkeys and wild birds.
Family THYSANOSOMIDAE
Closely related to the Anoplocephalidae, this family contains several
ruminants (Stilesia, Thysanosoma, Thysaniezia and Avitellina)
The intermediate stage is a cysticercoid present in forage mites of the
family Oribatidae.
OrderPSEUDOPHYLLIDEA
The morphology of the Pseudophyllidea is generally similar to that of the
Cyclophyllidea, but there are two distinct features. First, the scolex has no
suckers and instead has two longitudinal grooves or bothria, which
become flattened to form organs of attachment. Secondly, the egg shell is
thick, brown and operculate, and the coracidium, which emerges after
hatching, is an oncosphere with an embryophore which is ciliated for
mobility in water.
69
The pseudophyllidean life cycle utilises two intermediate hosts. The
coracidium must first be ingested by a crustacean in whose body cavity a
freshwater fish, the procercoid is liberated, and in the muscles of the new
host develops into a second larval stage, a plerocercoid, which possesses
the characteristic scolex; it is only this stage which is infective to the final
host.
This order contains only two genera of veterinary importance,
Diphyllobothrium and Spirometra.
Family DIPHYLLOBOTHRIIDAE
The genus Diphyllobothrium is an important cestode of humans and
fish-eating mammals. They are long tapeworms with an unarmed scolex,
with two muscular bothria.
Spirometra are tapeworms of dogs, cats and wild carnivores and an
ENTOMOLOGY
Veterinary entomology, in its literal sense, means a study of insects of
veterinary importance. This term, however, is commonly used to describe
the wider study of all arthropods parasitic on animals, including arachnids
such as ticks and mites.
Phylum ARTHROPODA
The phylum Arthropoda contains over 80% of all known animal species
and consists of invertebrates whose major characteristics are a hard
chitinous exoskeleton, a segmented body and jointed limbs.
70
CLASSIFICATION
There are two major classes of arthropods of veterinary importance,
namely the [nsecta and Arachnida, and the important orders in these
classes are shown in Figs 1.10 and 1.11.
The two major classes can be differentiated by the following general
characteristics:
Insecta: These have three pairs of legs, the head, thorax and abdomen are
distinct, and they have a single pair of antennae.
Arachnida: The adults have four pairs of legs, the body is divided into the
gnathosoma (mouthparts) and idiosoma (fused cephalo-thorax and
abdomen);there areno antennae.

A third class of arthropod, the Pentastomida, is of lesser veterinary
importance. The adults are found in the respiratory passages of vertebrates
and resemble annelid worms rather than arthropods.

Arthropods are metameric, that is they are divided into segments.
However, within a number of arthropod classes, particularly the arachnids.

and, in many of the mites for example, it has almost disappeared.
Segments have become fused into clusters, such as the head, thorax and to
a lesser extent the abdomen. Each group of segments is specialised for
functions different from those of the other parts of the body.
EXOSKELETON
The exoskeleton is the outer covering, which provides support and
protection  to  the living 
 tissues of  arthropods.  The exoskeleton  is
non-cellular. Instead it is composed of a number of layers of cuticle,
which are secreted by a single outer cell layer of the body known as the
epidermis (Fig. 1.12). The outer layer of cuticle, the epicuticle, is
composed largely of proteins and, in many arthropods, is covered by a
waxy layer. The next two layers are the outer exocuticle and the inner
endocuticle. Both are composed of a protein and a polysaccharide called
72
chitin, which has long, fibrous molecules containing nitrogen. For extra
strength the exocuticle may be tanned, or sclerotised. This is where
proteins, interwoven between the chitin bundles, become tightly
cross-linked giving it extra strength. The sclerotised cuticle is hard and
dark in colour.

The cuticle is often penetrated by fine pore canals, which allow the
passage of secretions from the epidermis to the surface. The cuticle has
many outgrowths in the form of scales, spines, hairs and bristles.
Movement is made possible by the division of the cuticle into separate
plates, called sclerites. Plates are connected by intersegmental
membranes, where the cuticle is soft and flexible (Fig. 1.13). The
          
of the cuticle called apodemes. The soft, flexible, unsclerotised cuticle
present at the joints of the adult arthropod exoskeleton also occurs in the
integument of larval arthropods.
APPENDAGES
However, the number of appendages has frequently been modified
through loss or structural differentiation. In insects there are always three
pairs of legs in the adult stage. In mites and ticks there are three pairs of
legs in the larval life cycle stage and four pairs in the nymphal and adult
stages. The cuticular skeleton of the legs is divided into tube-like
segments connected to one another by soft articular membranes, creating
joints at each junction.
GAS EXCHANGE
For some small arthropods the exoskeleton is thin and lacks a waxy
epicuticle. For these animals oxygen and carbon dioxide simply diffuse
74
directly across the cuticle. However, this method of gas exchange is only
functional over very short distances and for very small animals. In most of
the terrestrial groups of arthropod ectoparasite, the protective cuticle is
punctured by a number of openings. In the insects these openings are
called spiracles; in the mites and ticks they are called stigmata (Fig
1.14).

Typically spiracles or stigmata open into cuticlelined air-conducting tubes
called tracheae, which form longitudinal and transverse tracheal trunks
that interconnect among the segments. The tracheae branch repeatedly as
they extend to all parts of the body. The branches of the tracheae end
within the cells of muscles and other tissues in extremely fine tracheoles,
which are the principal sites of gas exchange. The ends of the tracheoles
contain fluid and are usually less than l μm in diameter. Tracheoles are
Oxygen enters through the respiratory openings and passes down the
trachea, usually by diffusion along a concentration gradient. Carbon
dioxide and (in terrestrial insects) water vapour move in the opposite
direction. Water loss is a major problem for most terrestrial arthropds and
    e o si xa s  
oxygen into the body while making sure that they do not desiccate. Hence
in periods of inactivity the respiratory openings are often kept closed by
valves which open only periodlically. In large and highly mobile insects
75
active pumping movements of the thorax and or abdomen may be used to
help to ventilate the outer parts of the tracheal system.
CIRCULATORYSYSTEM
The arthropod circulatory system is relatively simple, consisting of a
series of central cavities or sinuses, called a haemocoel (Fig. 1.15). The
haemocoel contains blood, called haemolymph, in which hormones are
transported, nutrients are distributed from the gut and wastes removed via
 the excretory organs. The haemolymph is not involved in gas exchange.

on the other hand have a functional equivalent of the heart, the dorsal
vessel. This is essentially a tube running along the length of the body. The
76
dorsal vessel is open at its anterior end, closed at its posterior end and is
perforated by pairs of lateral openings called ostia. The ostia only permit a
one-way flow of haemolymph into the dorsal vessel. The dorsal vessel

NERVOUSSYSTEM
Arthropods have a complex nervous system associated with the well
developed sense organs, such as eyes and antennae, and behaviour that is
often highly elaborate. The central nervous system consists of a dorsal
brain in the head which is connected by a pair of nerves which run around
the foregut to a series of ventral nerve cord ganglia.
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
The gut of an arthropod is essentially a simple tube that runs from mouth
to anus. The precise shape of the gut varies between arthropods depending
on the nature of their diet.

The gut is divided into three sections: the foregut, midgut and hindgut
(Fig. 1.16). The foregut and hindgut are lined with cuticle. In fluid-feeding
arthropods there are prominent muscles, which attach to the walls of the
pharynx, to form a pump. The foregut is concerned primarily with the
ingestion and storage of food, the latter usually taking place in the crop.
77
Between the foregut and the midgut is a valve called the proventriculus
or gizzard. The midgut is the principal site of digestion and absorption. [t
has a cellular lining, which secretes digestive enzymes. Absorption takes
place largely in the anterior of the midgut, in large outpockets called
gastric caecae. The hindgut terminates in an expanded region, the
rectum, which functions in the absorption of water and the formation of
faeces. Nitrogenous wastes are eliminated from the haemocoel by long,
thin projections called the Malpighian tubules, which open into the gut at
the junction of the mid- and the hindgut. In mites and ticks the gut follows
a broadly similar plan, but may be simplified, often with only one pair of
Malpighian tubules.
ARTHROPODSENSEORGANS
The sensory receptors of arthropods are usually associated with
modifications of the chitinous exoskeleton. The most common type of
receptor is associated with hairs, bristles and setae. Bristles may act as
Alternatively, the bristle may carry chemoreceptors, which may be
senstive to specific chemical cues. The sensory hairs and bristles are
legs.

eye, is large with thousands of long, cylindrical units called ommatidia,
each covered by a translucent cornea, called a facet. There is no
mechanism for accommodation, the compound eye does not form an
effective image and its principal function is in detecting movement. In the
female of some species of insect the eyes are distinctly separated
(dichoptic) while in the males they may be very close together (holoptic).

arthropods, such as the ticks and lice, eyes may be greatly reduced or
78
absent. In others such as some blood-sucking flies, whose sight is
important in locating their hosts, the eyes are well developed.
REPRODUCTTVESYSTEM
In most arthropods the sexes are separate and mating is usually required
for the production of fertile eggs. The female reproductive system is
composed of a pair of ovaries. Each ovary is divided into egg tubes, or
ovarioles. The ovarioles lead, via the oviduct to an ovipositor. Most
  r  s a    's a o
oviduct, and live larvae may be deposited at various stages of
development.
The male reproductive system is usually composed of a pair or testes,
each subdivided into a set of sperm tubes, leading to the vas deferens and
the external genitalia, with a penis, or aedeagus. Accessory glands
which encloses the sperm and protects it during insemination.
  o  ae a m     
some species of mite, the spermatophore is deposited on the ground and
the female is induced to walk over and pick up the spermatophore with her
genital opening. Sperm are usually stored by the female in organs called
MOULTING
To grow, arthropods must shed the exoskeleton periodically; this is
moulting or, more properly, ecdysis. Before the old exoskeleton is shed
the epidermis secretes a new epicuticle. The new epicuticle is soft and
wrinkled at this stage. When the old skeleton is shed the soft, whitish
exoskeleton of the newly moulted animal is stretched, often by the
ingestion of air or water. Once expanded, sclerotisation occurs, resulting
in hardening and darkening of the cuticle. The stages between moults are
known as stages, or stadia, and distinct morphological life cycle stages
are known as instars.
79
Class INSECTA
GENERAL MORPHOLOGY AND
LIFE CYCLE
Members of the class Insecta can be distinguished from the other
arthropods by the presence of only three pairs of legs in the adults, and the
abdomen.
The head carries the main sensory organs: the single pair of antennae, a
pair of compound eyes and, often, a number of ocelli. The mouth is
 u g  a a a m s  
ancestral form, represented by living insects such as cockroaches or
grasshoppers, the mouthparts are composed of the following elements
ay au on pauoee aeid pesuy e si dl saddn o unqei aui (il'l ai)
or clypeus. The paired mandibles (jaws) and maxillae (secondary jaws)
have areas of their surfaces adapted for cutting, slashing or grinding. The
maxillae may also carry maxillary palps, which are sensory in function
and used in the monitoring of food. A hypopharynx arises from the floor
of the mouth and bears the external opening of the salivary glands and is
similar to a tongue. A labium or lower lip usually bears two sensory labial
palps, but these may be extensively modified, especially in flies. The
mouthparts of different insects showa remarkable varietyof
specialisation, which is related to their diet.

by a short, triangular trochanter. There then follows the femur, the tibia,
One to five segments of the tarsus, the tarsomeres and, finally, the
pretarsus composed of claws and ridged pads. Between the claws there
may be two pad-like pulvilli surrounding a central bristle or pad, known
as the empodium (Fig. 1.18). The legs of insects are generally adapted for
walking or running but some are modified for specialised functions, such
as jumping (fleas) or clinging to the hairs of their host's body (lice).
        o  
mesothorax and metathorax (pterygotes). Some orders of primitive insects
have never developed wings (apterygotes), while others, such as the fleas
and lice, which once had wings, have now lost them completely. Others,
such as some of the hippoboscids, have wings for only a short time as
adults, after which they are shed. The wing consists of a network of
sclerotised veins, which enclose regions of thin, transparent cuticle called
cells. The veins act as a framework to brace and stabilise the wing and
may carry haemolymph and nerves. The arrangement of the veins tends to
be characteristic of various groups of insect species and so is important in
identification and taxonomy (Fig. 1.19). In several groups of insects, such
as beetles, the front wings have been modified to various degrees as
protective coverings for the hind wings and abdomen, known as elytra. In
the true flies (the Diptera) the hind wings have been reduced to form a pair
of club-like halteres, which are used as stabilising organs to assist in
flight.
The abdomen is composed primitively of 11 segments, although the tenth
and eleventh segments are usually small and not externally visible and the
eleventh segment has been lost in most advanced groups. The genital
ducts open ventrally on segment eight or nine of the abdomen and these
simple abdominal appendages. In the male, the basic external genitalia
consist of one or two pairs of claspers, which grasp the female in
copulation, and the penis (aedeagus). However, there is considerable
variation in the precise shape of the male genitalia in various groups of
82
species. In the female the tip of the abdomen is usually elongated to form
an ovipositor.

Within the class Insecta there are generally considered to be 30 orders, of
which only three, the flies (Diptera), fleas (Siphonaptera) and lice
(Phthiraptera), are of major veterinary importance.
INSECTLIFECYCLES
In most insects, the juvenile stadia broadly resemble the adult, except that
the genitalia and, where appropriate, wings are not developed. The
juveniles, usually called nymphs, make new cuticle and shed the old one
at intervals throughout development, typically four or five times,
increasing in size before the emergence of the adult. This is often
described as a simple life cycle with incomplete or partial metamorphosis,
known as hemimetabolous metamorphosis (Fig. 1.20)
In other, more advanced, insects the juvenile and adult stages are
dissimilar. The juvenile instar, which may be referred to as a larva,
maggot, grub or caterpillar, has become concerned primarily with
feeding and growth. In contrast, the adult, or imago, has become the
specialised reproductive and dispersal instar. To reach the adult form, the
larva must undergo complete metamorphosis, during which the entire
body is reorganised and reconstructed. The transformation between the
juvenile and the adult is made possible by the incorporation of a pupal
stage, which acts as a bridge between juvenile and adult. The pupa does
not feed and is generally (but not always) immobile. However, it is
metabolically very active as old larval tissues and organs are lost or
remoulded and replaced by adult organs. This pattern of development is
83
described as a complex life cycle with holometabolous metamorphosis
(Fig. 1.21).

Family CIMICIDAE
Bed-bugs of the genus, Cimex, are blood feeders on a wide range of
animals and humans.
FamilyREDUVIDAE
 Triatome or cone-nose bugs, sometimes called kissing or assassin bugs, of
the genera Rhodnius, Triatoma and Panstrongylus, are blood-feeders on a
wide range of animals and humans. They are vectors of the protozoan
parasite Trypanosoma cruzi which causes Chagas’ disease, in South
America.

Order DIPTERA

the insect to maintain stable flight. All species of Diptera have a complex
life cycle with complete metamorphosis. As a result, dipterous flies can be
parasites as larvae or adults, but they are rarely parasites in both life cycle
stages. The adults of many members of this order are also important as
vectors of disease.
The order Diptera is most commonly divided into three sub-orders,
Cyclorrhapha, Brachycera and Nematocera, and this is the
classification system that will be adopted here (Fig. 1.22). Adults of these
suborders can be distinguished morphologically by wing venation (Fig.
1.23) and antennal structure (Fig. 1.24), and also by ecological habitats.
        
should be replaced as an infraorder known as the Muscomorpha, within an
enlarged sub-order Brachycera. This is known as the ‘McAlpine
classification' but is not, as yet, universally accepted.
Suborder NEMATOCERA
Flies of the sub-order Nematocera are usually small, slender and delicate
(Fig. 1.24). The wings are often long and narrow, with conspicuous
longitudinal veins (Fig. 1.23). The palps are usually pendulous, though not
in mosquitoes, and usually are composed of four or five segments. Only
the females are parasitic and have piercing-sucking mouthparts. Eggs are
laid in or near water and develop into aquatic larvae and pupae: both of
these stages have recognisable heads and are mobile.

Family CERATOPOGONIDAE
This family consists of very small flies, which are commonly known as
biting midges. The females feed on humans and animals and are known to
90
transmit various viruses, protozoa and helminths. The only important
genus from a veterinary standpoint is Culicoides.
FamilySIMULIDAE

most important. Commonly referred to as *blackflies’ or “buffalo gnats*
they have a wide host range, feeding on a great variety of mammals and
birds and causing annoyance due to their painful bites. In humans
however, they are most important as vectors of Onchocerca volvulus, the
filarioid nematode that causes ‘river blindness' in Africa and Central and
South America.
Family PSYCHODIDAE
The flies of this family are called the ‘sandflies’ with Phlebotomus the
Lutzomyia is of medical importance. Both genera are important as vectors
of Leishmania. Since, in some areas of the world, the term 'sandflies
includes some biting midges and blackflies a better term is ^phlebotomine
sandflies'.
Family CULICIDAE
The Culicidae are the mosquitoes. They are small slender flies with long
legs. Although their bites are a severe nuisance to humans and animals
filarial nematodes and viruses. Primarily because of their importance as
vectors of human malaria there is a vast literature on their classification,
behaviour and control, but the family is of limited veterinary significance
and only general aspects of morphology, significance and control need be
discussed. The main genera of importance are Anopheles, Aedes and
Culex.
SuborderBRACHYCERA
These are large flies with stout antennae often consisting of only three
segments, the last segment frequently bearing annulations (Fig. 1.24). The
maxillary palps are usually held forwards and cross-veins are present on
91
the wings. The females use their slashing-sponging mouthparts to pierce
the skin of their host and then feed on the pool of blood created (Fig.
1.26). The eggs are laid on vegetation overhanging mud or shallow water
retractile heads. Like the Nematocera, both larvae and pupae are mobile
and aquatic, and are usually found in mud.

Family TABANIDAE
There is only a single family of Brachycera of major veterinary interest,
the Tabanidae, species of which are often known as horse flies, deer flies
and clegs. The pain caused by their bites leads to interrupted feeding, and
as a consequence, flies may feed on a succession of hosts and are therefore
important in the mechanical transmission of pathogens such as
trypanosomes.
The Tabanidae is one of the largest families of Diptera, containing an
estimated 8000 species divided into 30 genera, only three of which are of
major veterinary importance: Tabanus (horse flies), Haematopota and
Chrysops (deer flies). Species of the genus Tabanus are found worldwide;
the Haematopota are largely Palaearctic, Afrotropical and Oriental in
distribution; species of the genus Chrysops are largely Holarctic and
Oriental.
92
Suborder CYCLORRHAPHA
These are small to medium-sized flies with short, three-segmented
antennae, the last of which often bears a feather-like attachment, the arista.
The maxillary palps are small and the wings show cross-venation.
The cyclorrhaphous Diptera of veterinary interest are divided into the
three superfamilies Muscoidea, Hippoboscoidea and Oestroidea. The
Muscoidea and Hippoboscoidea, each contain two families of veterinary
interest, the Muscidae and Fannidae and the Hippoboscidae and
Glossinidae, respectively. The superfamily Oestroidea contains three
families of veterinary interest, Oestridae, Calliphoridae and
Sarcophagidae, species of which are primarily associated with myiasis,
the infestation of the tissues of a living host with fly larvae.

cyclorrhaphous Diptera of veterinary interest. Sponging mouthparts are
93
used for feeding on liquid films. Such mouthparts are found in groups
such as the house flies, blow flies and face flies. Biting mouthparts are
used for puncturing the skin and drinking blood. They occur in groups
such as the stable flies, horn flies and tsetse flies. In the sponging- type
 mouthparts, as seen in the house fly, the proboscis is an elongate feeding
tube, composed of a basal rostrum bearing the maxillary palps, a median
flexible haustellum, composed of the labium and flap-like labrum, and
apical labella (Fig. 1.27). Mandibles and maxillae are absent. The labrum
and the hypopharynx lie within the flexible anterior gutter in the labium.
The labella are sponging organs, the inner surface of which are lined by
grooves called pseudotracheae. The grooves lead towards the oral
aperture, known as the prestomum. When feeding, the labella are
ns rauun su asoxa on pauado pue assad poonq q papuedxa
They are then applied to the liquid film. Liquid flows into and along the
grooves by capillary action and then is drawn up the food canal by
muscular pumping action. At rest, the inner surfaces of the labella are in
close contact and kept moist by secretions from the labial salivary glands.
The house fly proboscis is jointed and can be withdrawn into the head
capsule when not in use by the retraction of the rostrum. There are a
number of minute teeth surrounding the prestomum, which can be used
directly to rasp at the food. These teeth may be well developed and
important in the feeding of various species of Muscidae, for example
Hydrotaeairritans.
The ancestral cyclorrhaphous Diptera probably had the sponging
mouthparts as described, without mandibles and maxillae. However, a
number of species, such as stable flies and tsetse flies, have developed a
blood-sucking habit and show modifications of the basic house fly
mouthparts, which reflect this behaviour.

In blood-feeding Muscidae, the labella have been reduced in size and the
pseudotracheae have been replaced by sharp teeth. The labium has been
lengthened and surrounds the labrum and hypopharynx (Fig. 1.28). The
rostrum is reduced and the rigid haustellum cannot be retracted. [n
feeding, the teeth of the labella cut into the skin. The entire labium and the
labrum-hypopharynx, forming the food canal, are inserted into the wound.
Saliva passes down a duct in the hypopharynx and blood is sucked up the
food canal. Variations on this general pattern range from the robust
mouthparts of stable flies to the delicate mouthparts of tsetse flies.
The larvae of cyclorrhaphous Diptera have a poorly defined head, and are

The mature larva pupates on or in the ground, within a hard pupal case or
puparium, which is completely immobile. When the adult fly is ready to
emerge, it does so by inflating a membranous ptilinal sac situated at the
front of the head, which then pushes off a circular cap at the anterior end
of the puparium.
Family MUSCIDAE
This family comprises many biting and non-biting genera, the latter
         n  s
responsible for ‘fly-worry’ in livestock and a number of species are
vectors of important bacterial, helminth and protozoal diseases of animals.
The major genera of veterinary importance include Musca (house flies and

Family HIPPOBOSCIDAE
The Hippoboscidae are unusual in being flattened dorsoventrally and
having an indistinctly segmented abdomen, which is generally soft and

mammals and birds and have strong claws on the feet, which allow them
to cling to hair or feathers. They tend to be either permanent ectoparasites
or to remain on their hosts for long periods. The two major genera of
Family GLOSSINIDAE
The sole genus in the family Glossinidae is Glossina, species of which are
known as tsetse flies. Tsetse flies are entirely restricted to sub-Saharan
Africa, and feed exclusively on the blood of vertebrates and are of
importance as vectors of trypanosomosis in animals and humans.
Family CALLIPHORIDAE
The Calliphoridae, known as blow flies, are a large family, composed of
over 1000 species divided between 150 genera. At least 80 species have
been recorded as causing traumatic, cutaneous myiasis. These species are
found largely in five important genera: Cochliomyia, Chrysomya,
Cordylobia, Lucilia and Calliphora. The genera Protophormia and
Phormia also each contain a single species of importance. Most of these
species are either primary or secondary facultative invaders. Only two
species, Chrysomya bezziana and Cochliomyia hominivorax, are obligate
agents of myiasis.
FamilySARCOPHAGIDAE
The family Sarcophagidae, known as flesh flies, contains over 2000
species in 400 genera. Most species of Sarcophagidae are of no veterinary
importance, breeding in excrement, carrion and other decomposing
organic matter. The principal genus containing species which act as
important agents of veterinary myiasis is Wohlfahrtia.
97
Family OESTRIDAE
This is an important family consisting of several genera of large, usually
hairy, flies whose larvae are obligatory parasites of animals. All are
obligate parasites, showing a high degree of host specificity. The adults
have primitive, non-functional mouthparts. However, their larvae spend
their entire period of larval growth and development feeding within their
vertebrate
hosts, causing  nasopharyngeal,
digestive  tract,  or
dermalfuruncular myiases. The larvae are characterised by posterior
spiracular plates containing numerous small pores.
The Oestridae contains about 150 species, known as the bots and warbles.
There are four sub-families of importance: Oestrinae, Gasterophilinae,
Hypodermatinae and Cuterebrinae. The sub-family Oestrinae contains
one genus of major importance, Oestrus, and three genera of lesser
importance, Rhinoestrus, Cephenemyia and Cephalopina. The sub-family
Gasterophilinae contains a single genus of importance, Gasterophilus. The
sub-family Hypodermatinae contains one genus of major importance,
Hypoderma, and a second, less widespread genus, Przhevaiskiana. The
sub-family Cuterebrinae contains two genera of interest, Cuterebra and
Dermatobia. Other oestrids, though of limited geographical distribution,
but locally of veterinary importance are Cephenemyia, Oedemagena,
Gedoeistia and Cephalopina.
OrderPHTHlRAPTERA
The lice (order Phthiraptera) are permanent obligate ectoparasites, which
are highly host specific, many species even preferring specific anatomical
areas. They usually only leave their host to transfer to a new one. They are
small insects, about 0.5-8 mm in length, dorsoventrally flattened and
possess stout legs and claws for clinging tightly to fur, hair and feathers.
lifestyle, and lice are thought to be derived originally from winged
ancestors. They feed on epidermal tissue debris, parts of feathers,
sebaceous secretions and blood. They usually vary in colour from pale
beige to dark grey, but they may darken considerably on feeding. Most are
blind, but a few species have simple photosensitive eye spots.
The Phthiraptera is a small order with about 3500 described species, of
which only about 20-30 are of major economic importance. The
98
classification of the Phthiraptera is complex and remains the subject of
some debate. The order is divided into four sub-orders: Anoplura,
Amblycera, Ischnocera and Rhynchophthirina. However, the
Rhynchophthirina is a very small sub-order, including just two African
species, one of which is a parasite of elephants and the other a parasite of
warthogs. The Anoplura, known as the sucking lice, are usually large, up
to 5 mm, with small, pointed heads and terminal mouthparts (Fig. 1.30)
They are generally slow moving, and have powerful legs, each with a
single large claw. They occur exclusively on mammals. The description
"biting lice', sometimes used to describe the Anoplura, is a misnomer,
because all lice bite.
In the veterinary literature,the Amblycera and Ischnocera are usually
discussed together and described as the Mallophaga which, in older
textbooks, is accorded status as a sub-order in its own right. However,

LOUSELIFECYCLES
Sucking and chewing lice have very similar life cycles. During a life span
are usually whitish, and are glued to the hair or feathers where they may
be seen with the naked eye (Fig. 1.31). There is no true metamorphosis
and from the egg hatches a nymph, similar to, though much smaller than.
the adult. After three moults the fully grown adult is present. The whole
cycle from egg to adult usually takes 2-3 weeks.

chewing lice are equipped for biting and chewing and have a wider range

dermal scales and blood scabs; the bird lice also feed on skin scales and
scabs, but unlike the mammalian species, they can digest keratin, so that
they also eat feathers and down.

The effect of lice is usually a function of their density. A small number of

high densities. Such heavy louse infestations may cause pruritus, alopecia,
      s  
lethargy and loss of weight gain or reduced egg production. Severe
infestation with sucking lice may cause anaemia. Heavy infestations are
usually associated with young animals or older animals in poor health, or
thosekeptin unhygienic conditions.
Transfer of lice from animal to animal or from herd to herd is usually by
direct physical contact. Because lice do not survive for long off their host,
the potential for animals to pick up infestations from dirty housing is
limited, although it cannot be ignored. Occasionally, lice also may be
transferred between animals by attachment to flies (phoresy).
In temperate habitats, louse populations are dynamic and exhibit
pronounced seasonal fluctuations. The seasonal increase in louse

some other underlying problem, such as malnutrition or chronic disease.
Suborder ANOPLURA
The sub-order contains several families, two of which are of major
importance in veterinary medicine, the Haematopinidae and the
Linognathidae. The Polyplacidae and Hoploperidae contain species which
are parasites of rodents. The Echinophthiridae contains species which are
parasites of marine mammals and the Neolinagnathidae, of which there
are only two species that are parasites of elephant shrews. Two other
families of medical interest are the Pediculidae and Pthiridae.
101
Family HAEMATOPINIDAE
The family Haematopinidae contains the genus Haematopinus (the
'short-nosed’ louse), which is the main one of veterinary importance. This
is the largest louse of domestic mammals, up to 0.5 cm in length, found in
cattle, pigs and horses.
FamilyLINOGNATHlDAE
The family Linognathidae contains two genus of veterinary importance.
sheep, goats and dogs. Solenopotes is a small bluish louse, which tends to
occur in clusters on cattle.
FamilyMICROTHORACIDAE
This family contains four species of the genus Microthoracius. Three
species parasitise llamas and a fourth species is parasitic on camels.
Family POLYPLACIDAE
Lice of the genus Polyplax infest rodents and may cause problems in
laboratory colonies.
Suborder AMBLYCERA
Amblycera are ectoparasites of birds, marsupials and New World
mammals. Adults are medium-sized or relatively large lice, usually 2-3
mm in length. They have large, rounded heads on which the eyes are
reduced or absent. They are chewing lice with mouthparts consisting of
distinct mandibles on the ventral surface and a pair of two- to
four-segmented  maxillary palps.  The  four-segmented antennae are
protected in antennal grooves, so that only the last segment is visible. The
Amblycera contains six families, of which the families Menoponidae,
Boopidae, Gyropidae and Trimenoponidae are of relevance to veterinary
medicine.
102
Family MENOPONIDAE
Several genera are of veterinary importance on birds. Menacanthus can
cause severe anaemia and is the most pathogenic louse of adult domestic
hens and cage birds, in particular canaries. Menopon is found mainly on
the domestic hen, but it will spread to other fowl, such as turkeys and
ducks, which are in contact. Holomenopon is found on ducks.
FamilyBOOPIDAE
Members of this family occur on marsupials. Heterodoxus may be of
importance on dogs and other canidae.
Family GYROPIDAE
 o s sid  i d     do
family may be distinguished from other families of chewing lice because
the tarsi of the mid- and hindlegs have either one or no claws.
FamilyTRIMENOPONIDAE
Trimenopon is found on guinea pigs.
Suborder ISCHNOCERA
The Ischnocera includes three families, two of which, the Philopteridae on
domestic birds and Trichodectidae on mammals, are of major veterinary
importance.
Family PHILOPTERIDAE
The family Philopteridae contains the genera Cuclotogaster, Lipeurus,
Goniodes, Goniocotes and Columbicola, species of which are important
parasites of domestic birds. The Philopteridae have five- segmented
antennae and paired claws on the tarsi.
103
Family TRICHODECTIDAE
The family Trichodectidae contains the genera Bovicola (Damalinia),
found on cattle, sheep and horses; Felicola, the sole species of louse found
on cats; and Trichodectes found on dogs.
The Trichodectidae have three-segmented antennae and a single claw on
the tarsi.
Suborder RHYNCHOPHTHIRINA
The Rhynchophthirina is is a very small sub-order including just two
species, which are parasites of elephants and warthogs.
Order SIPHONAPTERA
Fleas (Siphonaptera) are small, wingless, obligate blood-feeding insects.
Both sexes are blood-feeders and only the adults are parasitic. The order is
relatively small with about 2500 described species, almost all of which are
morphologically extremely similar. Over 95% of flea species are
ectoparasites of mammals, whilst the others are parasites of birds.
Fleas (Fig. 1.32) are dark brown, wingless insects, usually between 1 and
6 mm in length, with females being larger than males. The body colour
may vary from light brown to black. The body is laterally compressed
with a glossy surface, allowing easy movement through hairs and feathers.
Eyes, when present, are simply dark, photosensitive spots, and the
antennae, which are short and club-like, are recessed into the head. The
third pair of legs is much longer than the others, an adaptation for
jumping. The head and first segment of the thorax ( pronotum) may bear
ventral (genal) or posterior (pronotal) rows of dark spines called ctenidia
or ^combs', and these are important features used in identification.

Many species of flea are able to parasitise a range of hosts. This,
combined with their mobility, which allows them to move easily between
hosts, makes them parasites of considerable medical and veterinary
importance and makes them difficult to control. Once on their host, fleas
feed daily or every other day. Females require significantly more blood
than males. Blood-feeding may have a range of damaging effects on the
host animal, causing inflammation, pruritus or anaemia. Fleas may also
act as vectors of bacteria, protozoa, viruses and tapeworms. However, in
veterinary entomology fleas are probably of most importance as a cause of
and poultry, their readiness to parasitise humans as alternative hosts gives
Ruminants, horses and pigs do not have their own species of fleas.
FLEALIFECYCLES
Fleas are holometabolous and go through four stages: egg, larva, pupa and
adult (Fig. 1.33). The ovoid eggs have smooth surfaces, and may be laid
Occurs in 2 days to 2 weeks, depending on the temperature of the
surroundings. The larvae are maggot-like, with a distinct, brownish head
and have a coat of bristles. There are no appendages. They have chewing
mouthparts and feed on debris and on the faeces of the adult fleas, which
contain blood and give the larvae a reddish colour. The larva moults twice,
105
the final stage being about 5.0 mm long, and then spins a cocoon, from
which the adult emerges.
Moulting and pupation are dependent on the ambient temperature and
humidity. Under ideal conditions, the entire cycle may take only 18 days
to complete, although it can range from 6-12 months.
Two broad trends in flea life cycles can be seen. A simple association with
the nest habitat is preserved in many groups of the family Ceratophyllidae,
characterised by infrequent and brief associations with the host and often
considerable adult movement between hosts and nests. In contrast, many
groups of the family Pulicidae show prolonged adult associations with the
host. However, within these broad categories, a high degree of variation
may exist. A few genera remain permanently attached throughout adult
life. These are the burrowing, or ‘stickfast', fleas, whose females are
embedded in the skin, within nodules. Only the posterior part of these
fleas communicates with the surface, allowing the eggs or larvae to drop
to the ground and develop in the usual manner.

There are generally considered to be 15 or 16 families and 239 genera
Ceratophyllidae and the Pulicidae. The Ceratophyllidae is a large family.
at present thought to contain over 500 species, of which about 80 species
are parasites of birds and the remainder of which are parasites of small
rodents. Most species of the family are Holarctic in distribution. The
Pulicidae are parasites of a range of mammals. They are distributed
worldwide.
Family CERATOPHYLLIDAE
The Ceratophyllidae is a large family containing over 500 species of
which about 80 species are parasites of birds and the remainder are
parasites of rodents. The genus Nosopsyllus are fleas of rats;
Ceratophyflus parasitises mainly squirrels and other rodents, but contains
two species of veterinary importance because they feed on poultry and
Other birds.
Family PULICIDAE
The Pulicidae are parasites of a range of mammals with worldwide
distribution. Genera of veterinary importance include Ctenocephalides
(dog and cat fleas), Spilopsyllus, Echidnophaga, Puiex, Xenopsylla,
Archaeopsylla,Tunga and Leptopsylla.
Class ARACHNIDA
Members of the class Arachnida are a highly diverse group of largely
carnivorous, terrestrial arthropods. The arachnids do not possess antennae
or wings and they only have simple eyes. In this class there is only one
group of major veterinary importance, the sub-class Acari (sometimes
also called Acarina), containing the mites and ticks.
The sub-class Acari is an extremely diverse and abundant assembly; over
        r si o 5
averaging about 1 mm in length. However, some ticks may be over 3 cm
in length. Segmentation is inconspicuous or absent and the sections of the
body are broadly fused, so that the body appears sack-like.
107
The first pair of appendages, called chelicerae, is positioned in front of
the mouth and is used in feeding. The second pair of appendages appears
behind the mouth and is composed of palps. Their precise structure and
function varies from order to order. The palps are usually short, sensory
structures associated with the chelicerae. Together the chelicerae and
palps form a structure called the gnathosoma. The body posterior to the
gnathosoma is known as the idiosoma (Fig. l.34). In the adult, the
idiosoma is subdivided into the region that carries the legs, the podosoma.
and the area behind the last pair of legs, the opisthosoma. The legs are
six-segmented and are attached to the podosoma at the coxa, also known
as the epimere. This is then followed by the trochanter, femur, genu, tibia
and tarsus ending in a pair of claws and a pad-like pulvillus (Fig. 1.35)
There are three main lineages of extant mites: the Opiloacariformes, the
Parasitiformes and the Acariformes. The Opiloacariformes are thought to
be the most primitive of the living mites and are not parasitic. The
Parasitiformes possess one to four pairs of lateral stigmata posterior to the
coxae of the second pairs of legs and the coxae are usually free. The
Parasitiformes include the ticks, described as the Ixodida or Metastigmata.
and the gamesid mites or Mesostigmata. The Acariformes do not have
visible stigmata posterior to the coxae of the second pair of legs and the
coxae are often fused to the ventral body wall. The Acariformes include
the mite-like mites, the Sarcoptiformes and Trombidiformes, often
described as the Astigmata and Prostigmata, respectively. The terms
metastigmata, mesostigmata, astigmata and prostigmata, relate to the
position of the respiratory openings on the body and provide a convenient
way of distinguishing the four sub-orders of parasitic importance.

LIFECYCLES
There are four basic life cycle stages:t
the egg, a sixlegged larva,
eight-legged nymph and eight-legged adult (Fig. 1.36). But these may be
further divided into prelarva, larva, protonymph, deutonymph, tritonymph
and adult. There may also be more than one moult in each of these instars.
In many Acari, pre-larval and larval instars take place within the egg or
have been lost. In others, one or more of the nymphal instars may be
omittted.

The ticks, sub-order IXODIDA (Metastigmata)
The ticks are obligate, blood-feeding ectoparasites of vertebrates,
particularly mammals and birds. They are relatively large and long-lived,
  a o 's     
between meals. Tick bites may be directly damaging to animals, causing
irritation, inflammation or hypersensitivity, and, when present in large
numbers, anaemia and production losses. The salivary secretions of some
ticks may cause toxicosis and paralysis; however, more importantly, when
they attach and feed they are capable of transmitting a number of
pathogenic viral, bacterial, rickettsial and protozoal diseases.

Ticks belong to two families, the Ixodidae and Argasidae. The most
presence of a rigid chitinous scutum, which covers the entire dorsal
surface of the adult male. In the adult female and in the larva and nymph it
extends for only a small area, which permits the abdomen to swell after
feeding. The other family is the Argasidae or soft ticks, so-called because
they lack a scutum; included in this family are the bird ticks and the
tampans.
Family IXODIDAE
The [xodidae are relatively large ticks (between 2 and 20 mm), flattened
dorsoventrally. The enlarged fused coxae of the palps are known as the
is extended anteriorly and ventrally to form the hypostome, which lies
below the chelicerae (Fig. 1.37). The hypostome is armed with rows of
backward barbs or teeth, and is used as an anchoring device when the tick
feeds. Ventromedially there is a hypostome with recurved teeth for
maintaining position; it bears a dorsal groove to permit the flow of saliva
and host blood. The four-segmented sensory palps and heavily sclerotised
chelicerae are anterior and visible from the dorsal surface.

and, in some species, a row of notches, called festoons, on the posterior
border of the body. Chitinous plates are sometimes present on the ventral
surface of the males. Some ticks have coloured enamel-like areas on the
body and these are called ‘ornate ticks'.

organ, which is packed with chemoreceptors used for locating potential
hosts. Eyes, when present, are situated on the outside margin of the
113
stigmata, which lead to the tracheae. The stigmata are large and
positioned posterior to the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. In adults, the
genital opening, the gonopore, is situated ventrally behind the
gnathosoma, usually at the level of the second pair of legs, and is
surrounded by the genital apron. From the gonopore are a pair of genital
grooves extended backwards to the anal groove, located ventrally, and
usually posterior to the fourth pair of legs (Fig. 1.40).
The hard ticks are temporary parasites and spend relatively short periods
on the host. There is a single hexapod larval stage, and a single octopod
nymphal stage leading to the reproductive adut stage (Fig. 1.41). The
number of hosts to which they attach during their parasitic life cycle varies
from one to three. Based on this, they are classified as:

[xodid ticks are important vectors of protozoal, bacterial, viral and
rickettsial diseases. The [xodidae contains about 650 species of ticks in
thirteen genera. Ixodes is the largest genus containing 217 species. Other
genera of veterinary importance include Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus,
Haemaphysalis,Boophilus,Amblyomma,Hyalomma and Aponomma.
116
Family ARGASIDAE
Soft ticks have a leathery and unsclerotised body with a textured surface
which in unfed ticks may be characteristically marked with folds or
grooves (Fig. 1.42). The integument is inornate. The palps appear
somewhat leg-like with the third and fourth segments equal in size. The
gnathosoma is located ventrally and is not visible from the dorsal view in
nymphs and adults. When present, the eyes are present in lateral folds
above the legs. The stigmata are small and anterior to the coxae of the
fourth pair of legs. The legs are similar to those of hard ticks; the pulvulli
are usually absent or rudimentary in nymphs and adults, but may be well
developed in larvae.
The soft ticks have a multi-host life cycle. The larval stage feeds once
 q     e q   
and seven nymphal stages, each of which feeds then leaves the host before
moulting to the next stage. The adult females lay small batches of eggs
after each short feed, lasting only a few minutes.
These ticks, unlike the [xodidae, are drought resistant and capable of
living for several years, and are found predominantly in deserts or dry
conditions, but living in close proximity to their hosts. There are three
genera of veterinary importance, Argas, Otobius and Ornithodoros.
THEMITES
The ectoparasitic mites of mammals and birds inhabit the skin, where they
feed on blood, lymph, skin debris or sebaceous secretions, which they
ingest by puncturing the skin, scavenge from the skin surface or imbibe
from epidermal lesions. Most ectoparasitic mites spend their entire lives in
intimate contact with their host, so that transmission from host to host is
      s s   
significant welfare problems and economic losses. Some mites may be
intermediate hosts of anoplocephalid cestodes, including Anoplocephala,
Moniezia and Stilesia.

Parasitic mites are small, most being less than 0.5 mm long, though a few
blood-sucking  species  may   attain  several  millimetres  when   fully
engorged. The body is unsegmented but can show various sutures and
118
grooves. The body is divided into two sections, the gnathosoma and
idiosoma. The idiosoma may be soft, wrinkled and unsclerotised.
However, many mites may have two or more sclerotised dorsal shields
and two or three ventral shields: the sternal, genitoventral and anal
shields (Fig.1.43).These may be important features for mite
identification. The genitoventral shield, located between the last two
(posterior) pairs of legs, bears the genital orifice.
of sensory palps and a pair of chelicerae, the latter sometimes bearing
claw-like, or stylet-like chelae at their tips (Fig. 1.44). Between the
chelicerae is the buccal cone, both of which fit within a socket-like
chamber formed by enlarged coxae of the palps, ventrally and laterally
and by a dorsal projection of the body wall, called the rostrum.

In the mesostigmatic mites, the fused expanded coxal segments of the
palps at the base of the gnathosoma are known as the basal capituli, from
which protrudes the hypostome. The palps are one- or two-segmented in
 most astigmatic and prostigmatic mites, and five- or six-segmented in the
Mesostigmata. The last segment of the palps usually carries a palpal claw

anterior and posterior legs. Larval mites have three pairs of legs. The first
119
pairs of legs are often modified to form sensory structures and are
frequently longer and slender. At the end of the tarsus may be a pretarsus
claw or filamentous hair. In some parasitic astigmatic mites, the claws
may be absent and replaced by stalked pretarsi, which may be expanded
terminally into bell or sucker-like pulvilli (Figs 1.35 and 3.44)
In many mites, particularly astigmatic mites, gas exchange takes place
through the integument. In other mites, gas exchange takes place through
one to four pairs of stigmata, found on the idiosoma. The presence or
absence of stigmata is used for taxonomic purposes. The stigmata in
mesostigmatic mites can be associated with elongated processes called
peritremes.
Eyes are usually absent and, hence, most mites are blind. Where they are
present, however, in groups such as the trombidiformes, the eyes are
simple. Hairs, or setae, many of which are sensory in function, cover the
idiosoma of many species of mite. The number, position and size of the
setae are extremely important in the identification of mite species.
Although, like the ticks, mites are obligate parasites, they differ from them
 Aq Aue si uoissiusun 1eun os iso an uo '1npe o sa wo
The life cycle of many parasitic species may be completed in less than 4
weeks and in some species as little as 8 days. Unlike the ticks, once
infection is established, pathogenic populations can build up rapidly on an
animal without further acquisitions. Female mites produce relatively large
eggs from which a small, six-legged larva hatches. The larva moults to
          
nymphal stages, known respectively as the protonymph, deutonymph and
tritonymph. In many groups of mites, particularly the Astigmata, one of
these nymphal instars, usually the deutonymph, is usually a facultative
inactive, dispersal or protective stage, and may be omitted from the life

Sub-order TROMBIDIFORMES (PROSTIGMATA)
The trombidiformes (Prostigmata) is a large and diverse group of mites
existing in a wide range of forms, and occupying various ecological
habitats. Prostigmatic mites usually have stigmata, which open on the
gnathosoma or the anterior part of the idiosoma, known as the
propodosoma. There are over 50 families, of which four contain species of
veterinary importance: Demodicidae, Cheyletiellidae, Trombiculidae and
Psorergatidae. Other families may be of lesser importance, not as parasites
Family DEMODECIDAE
The Demodecidae is a family of prostigmatid mites, containing a single
genus of veterinary interest, Demodex, species of which are found in a
wide range of animals including humans. These are small mites with an
elongated 'cigar-shaped’ body and four pairs of 'stumpy’ legs, located at
123
the front of the body, in the adult. The striated opisthosoma forms at least
half the body length.
Species of the genus Demodex are highly specialised mites that live in the
hair follicles and sebaceous glands of a wide range of wild and domestic
animals, including humans. They are believed to form a group of closely
related sibling species, which are highly specific to particular hosts:
Demodex phylioides (pig), Demodex canis (dog), Demodex bovis (cattle),
Demodex equi (horse), Demodex musculi (mouse), Demodex ratti (rat),
Demodex caviae (guinea pig), Demodex cati (cat) and Demodex

Sub-order MESOSTTGMATA (Gamesid mites)
The Mesostigmata are a large group of mites, the majority of which are
predatory, but a small number of species are important as ectoparasites of
birds and mammals. Mesostigmatid mites have stigmata located above the
125
coxae of the second, third or fourth pairs of legs. They are generally large
with usually one large, sclerotised shield on the dorsal surface, and a
series of smaller shields in the midline of the ventral surface. The legs are
long and positioned anteriorly. Some species are host specific but the
majority parasitise a range of hosts. There are two main families of
veterinary interest, the Macronyssidae and Dermanyssidae, and four
families of minor interest, the Halarachinidae, Entonyssidae,
Rhinonyssidae and Laelapidae.
Family MACRONYSSIDAE
These are relatively large, blood-sucking ectoparasites of birds and
mammals of which Ornithonyssus, in birds, and Ophioryssus, in reptiles.
are of veterinary importance. Only the protonymph and adult stages feed.
The mites have relatively long legs and can be seen with the naked eye.
Family DERMANYSSIDAE
Species of the genus Dermanyssus are blood-feeding ectoparasites of birds
and mammals. They are large mites with long legs, greyish white,
becoming red when engorged. Ophionyssus are parasites of snakes.
FamilyHALARACHNIDAE
Mites of the subfamily Halarachinae are obligate parasites found in the
respiratory tract of mammals. Pneumoryssus is found in the nasal sinuses
and nasal passages of dogs. Members of the subfamily Riallietinae are
obligate parasites in the external ears of mammals. Raillietia is found in
the ears of domestic cattle.

PROTOZOOLOGY
KingdomPROTISTA
Subkingdom PROTOZOA
The Protozoa contains unicellular organisms, which belong to the
Kingdom, Protista. Protozoa are more primitive than animals, and no
matter how complex their bodies may be, all the different structures are
contained in a single cell
Protozoa, like most organisms, are eukaryotic, in that their genetic
information is stored in chromosomes contained in a nuclear envelope. In
this way they differ from bacteria which do not have a nucleus and whose
single chromosome is coiled like a skein of wool in the cytoplasm. This
primitive arrangement, found only in bacteria, rickettsia and certain algae,
is called prokaryotic and such organisms may be regarded as neither
animal nor plant, but as a separate kingdom of prokaryotic organisms, the
Monera.

basal body, and in some species is attached to the body of the protozoan
along its length, so that when the flagellum beats, the cell membrane
(pellicle) is pulled up to form an undulating membrane. Sometimes,
also, it projects beyond the protozoan body as a free flagellum. During
movement the shape of these organisms is maintained by microtubules in
the pellicle.
Other protozoa, such as Balantidium (Fig. 1.47), move by means of cilia
which are fine, short hairs, each arising from a basal body; these cover
much of the body surface and beat in unison to effect movement. In such
species a mouth or cytostome is present and the ciliary movement is also
used to waft food towards this opening.
A third means of locomotion, used by protozoa such as Entamoeba (Fig.
1.48) are pseudopodia, which are prolongations of cytoplasm. Movement
  s         
pseudopodium also possesses a phagocytic capacity and can function as a
cup, which closes, enveloping particulate food material in a vacuole.

Finally some protozoa, such as the extracellular stages of the Eimeria,
have no obvious means of locomotion, but are nevertheless capable of
gliding movements.
The nutrition of parasitic protozoa usually occurs by pinocytosis or
phagocytosis, depending on whether tiny droplets of fluid or small objects

process is the same, the cell membrane gradually enveloping the droplet or
complete, the particle is carried into the cell where fusion with lysosomes
effects digestion. Finally, undigested material is extruded from the cell. As
noted above, some ciliated protozoa and also some stages of the organisms
causing malaria obtain food through a cytostome. At the base of the
Metabolic products are excreted by diffusion through the cell membrane.
The infective stage of some protozoa is called a sporozoite, while the
term trophozoite is applied to that stage of the protozoa in the host, which
feeds and grows until division commences. In most protozoa, reproduction
is asexual and is accomplished by binary fission or, in the case of Babesia
       
which occurs in the subphylum Sporozoa is merogony (schizogony). In
the latter process, the trophozoite grows to a large size while the nucleus
divides repeatedly. This structure is called a meront (schizont) and, when
mature, each nucleus has acquired a portion of the cytoplasm so that the
schizont is filled with a large number of elongated separate organisms
called merozoites. The meront eventually ruptures, liberating the
individual merozoites.
Protozoa that only divide asexually generally have a short generation time.
provide the variants necessary for natural selection. However, most
Sporozoa at certain stages in their life cycle also have a sexual phase of
reproduction, called gametogony, which may be followed by a free-living
maturation phase, or sporogony. Sometimes, as in Eimeria, both asexual
and sexual phases occur in the same host while in others, such as
Plasmodium, the asexual phase occurs in the vertebrate host and the
sexual phase in the arthropod vector.
Finally it should be noted that, although this section deals with pathogenic
protozoa of veterinary importance there are many other species.
These protozoa assist in the digestion of cellulose, and on being passed to
the abomasum, act as a source of protein for the host.

KINESTOPLASTORIDA
(HAEMOFLAGELLATES)
The haemoflagellates all belong to the family Trypanosomatidae, and
include the trypanosomes and leishmanias.
133
MORPHOLOGY
Trypanosomes have a leaf-like or rounded body containing a vesicular
nucleus, and a varying number of subpellicular microtubules lying beneath
the outer membrane. There is a single flagellum arising from a
kinetosome or basal granule. An undulating membrane is present in some
genera and the flagellum lies on its outer border. Posterior to the
kinetosome is a rod-shaped or spherical kinetoplast containing DNA.
Members of this family were originally parasites of the intestinal tract of
insects, and many are still found in insects. Others are heteroxenous,
   e  a      o  
invertebrate host.
Members of the genus Trypanosoma are heteroxenous and pass through
amastigote, promastigote, epimastigote and tryptomastigote stages in their
life cycle. In some species only tryptomastigote forms are found in the
     s   
amastigote and tryptomastigote forms are present.
In the tryptomastigote form, the kinetoplast and kinetosome are near the
posterior end and the flagellum forms the border of an undulating
membrane that extends along the side of the body to the anterior end.
In the epimastigote form, the kinetoplast and kinetosome are just
posterior to the nucleus and the undulating membrane runs forward from
there.
[n the promastigote form, the kinetoplast and kinetosome are still further
anterior in the body and there is no undulating membrane.
In the amastigote form, the body is rounded and the flagellum emerges
from the body through a wide, funnel-shaped reservoir.

THETRANSMISSIONOF
TRYPANOSOMEINFECTIONIN
ANIMALS
With one exception, all trypanosomes have arthropod vectors in which
transmission is either cyclical or non-cyclical.
[n cyclical transmission the arthropod is a necessary intermediate host in
which the trypanosomes multiply, undergoing a series of morphological
transformations before forms infective for the next mammalian host are
produced. When multiplication occurs in the digestive tract and proboscis,
so that the new infection is transmitted when feeding, the process is
known  as anterior station development; the various species of

Salivaria. All are trypanosomes transmitted by tsetse flies, the main
species being Trypanosoma congolense (subgenus Nanomonas), T. vivax
(subgenus Duttonella) and T. brucei (subgenus Trypanozoon)
In other trypanosomes, multiplication and transformation occurs in the gut
and the infective forms migrate to the rectum and are passed with the
faeces; this is posterior station development and the trypanosome
species are grouped together as the Stercoraria. In domestic animals,

Trypanosomosis is one of the world's most important diseases of animals
and man. Most African species are transmitted by the tsetse flies
(Glossina).
SALIVARIAN TRYPANOSOMES
A number of species of Trypanosoma, found in domestic and wild
animals, are all transmitted cyclically by Glossina in much of sub-Saharan
Africa. Reproduction in the mammalian host is continuous, taking place in
the tryptomastigote stage. Salivarian trypanosomes are highly pathogenic
for certain mammals, such that the presence of trypanosomosis precludes

macrophage the promastigote reverts to the amastigote form and again
starts to divide.
Leishmania occur primarily in mammals, although ten species have been
described in Old World lizards. They cause disease in man, dogs and
various rodents. Leishmania have a heteroxenous life cycle, are
transmitted by sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus in the Old World and
Lutzomyia in the New World.
Hypopylaria are primitive species found in old world lizards, which
become infected following ingestion of sandflies. Development occurs in
the sandfly hindgut.
Peripylaria develop in both the hindgut and foregut of sandflies and
infect both lizards and mammals. Transmission in mammals is by bite of
sandflies.
Suprapylaria develop in the sandfly midgut and foregut and occur only in
mammals with transmission by sandfly bite.

FLAGELLATES
Members of the families Trichomonadidae, Monocercomonadidae and
Diplomonadidae occur predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract of
vertebrates. Whilst many are considered to be commensals, some may be
important causes of enteritis and diarrhoea.
140
Family TRICHOMONADIDAE
The family Trichomonadidae ('trichomonads') includes a number of
genera of medical and veterinary interest: Trichomonas, Tritrichomonas,
Tetratrichomonas,Trichomitus and Pentatrichomonas.The trichomonads
have three to five flagella, of which one is usually recurrent and attached
to an undulating membrane. Trichomonads have been found in the caecum
and colon of virtually every species of mammals and birds, and also in
host-parasite relationships of many remain unclear.
Tritrichomonas in cattle is an important venereal disease causing
infertility and abortion.
Family MONOCERCOMONADIDAE
These are similar in appearance to the trichomonads except there is no
undulating membrane. The genus Histomonas is of veterinary importance
causing major losses in turkeys and gamebirds. Monocercomonas occurs
in a wide range of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish and is
 generally considered nonpathogenic.
FamilyRETORTAMONADORIDIDAE
These protozoa are predominantly inhabitants of stagnant water but occur
in a wide range of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects and are generally
considered non-pathogenic. Species of Retortamonas are found in
humans, monkeys, cattle, sheep, rabbits and guinea pigs.
Family DIPLOMONADIDAE
The family Diplomonadidae contains two main genera of veterinary
interest, Giardia and Spironucleus, and a few minor genera considered to
be non-pathogenic in animals.
           si 
occurs in wild and domestic animals. The organism is bilaterally
symmetrical and possesses eight flagella, six of which emerge as free
flagella at intervals around the body. It is unique in possessing a large
adhesive disc on the flat ventral surface of the body, which facilitates
attachment to the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa.
141
Spironucleus (Hexamita) is a cause of enteritis and diarrhoea in birds
(particularly in poultry, gamebirds and pigeons) and rodents. Caviomonas
is found in the small intestine and Monocercomonoides, Protomonas,
Hexamastix and Chilomitus are found in the caecum of guinea pigs.
Family COCHLOSOMATIDAE
Cochlosoma occurs in the caeca of ducks and is of unknown
pathogenicity.
Phylum APICOMPLEXA
Protozoa within the phylum Apicomplexa (Sporozoa) are characterised by
occurring intracellularly and having an apical complex at some stage of
their development. The trophozoites have no cilia or flagella.
Reproduction involves both asexual (merogony or schizogony) and sexual
(gametogony) phases. Following gametogony, a zygote is formed which
divides to produce spores (sporogony).
Within the Class Sporozoasida, and Order Eucoccidiorida are three
suborders of veterinary significance, the Eimeriorina (the alimentary
sporozoa), and the Haemospororina and Piroplasmorina, which are blood
sporozoa.
SuborderEIMERIORlNA
The Eimeriorina contains parasites which occur mainly in vertebrates.
Those of major veterinary importance fall into three families, the
Eimeridae, Cryptosporididae and Sarcocystidae. Other families of lesser
significance include the Lankesterellidae and Atoxoplasmatidae.
GENERALISEDLIFECYCLE
The life cycle is divided into three phases: sporulation, infection and
merogony (schizogony), and finally, gametogony and oocyst formation
(Fig. 1.50).
142
SPORULATION
Unsporulated oocysts, consisting of a nucleated mass of protoplasm
enclosed by a resistant wall, are passed to the exterior in the faeces. Under
temperatures of around 27°C, the nucleus divides twice and the
protoplasmic mass forms four conical bodies radiating from a central
mass. Each of these nucleated cones becomes rounded to form a
sporoblast, while in some species the remaining protoplasm forms the
oocyst residual body. Each sporoblast secretes a wall of refractile material
and becomes known as a sporocyst, while the protoplasm within divides
        
protoplasm within the sporocyst forms a sporocyst residual body and the
sporocyst may have a knob at one end, the Stieda body. The time taken
for these changes varies according to temperature, but under optimal
conditions usually requires 2-4 days. The oocyst, now consisting of an
outer wall enclosing four sporocysts each containing two sporozoites, is
referred to as a sporulated oocyst and is the infective stage (Fig. 1.51).

sporocysts are then liberated either mechanically or by carbon dioxide,
and the sporozoites, activated by trypsin and bile, leave the sporocyst. In
is then known as a trophozoite. After a few days each trophozoite has
divided by multiple fission to form a meront (schizont), a structure
consisting of a large number of elongated nucleated organisms known as
merozoites. When division is complete and the meront is mature, the host
neighbouring cells. Merogony may be repeated, the number of meront
 generations depending on the species.
GAMETOGONY ANDOOCYST FORMATION
(SEXUAL REPRODUCTION)
Merogony terminates when the merozoites give rise to male and female
not fully known. The macrogametocytes are female and remain
unicellular, but increase in size to fill the parasitised cell. They may be
distinguished from trophozoites or developing meronts by the fact that
they have a single large nucleus. The male microgametocytes each
undergo repeated division to form a large number of flagellated
uninucleate organisms, the microgametes. It is only during this brief
phase that coccidia have organs of locomotion. The microgametes are
freed by rupture of the host cell, one penetrates a macrogamete, and fusion
of the micro- and macrogamete nuclei then takes place. A cyst wall forms
around the resulting zygote, now known as an oocyst, and no further
development usually takes place until this unsporulated oocyst is
liberated from the body in the faeces.
FamilyEIMERIDAE
This family contains 16 genera and some 1340 named species, of which
the most important are Eimeria and Isospora and infections with these
genera are often referred to as ^coccidiosis'. The genera are differentiated

Family CRYPTOSPORIDIDAE
This family contains a single genus, Cryptosporidium, with at least 13
species occurring in mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Members of this
family are small parasites infecting the brush border of epithelial cells
mainly in the gastrointestinal tract. The life cycle is monoxenous, but
immediately infective.
Family SARCOCYSTIIDAE
Five genera, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Besnoitia, Hammondia and
Frenkelia, are of veterinary interest. Their life cycles are similar to
Eimeria and Isospora except that the asexual and sexual stages occur in
intermediate and final hosts respectively. With the exception of the genus
Toxoplasma, they are normally non-pathogenic to their final hosts and
their significance is due to the cystic tissue stages in the intermediate
hosts, which include ruminants, pigs, horses and man. The tissue phase in
the intermediate host is obligatory, except in Toxoplasma where it is
facultative.
The genus Toxoplasma contains a single species. Unsporulated oocysts are
passed in the faeces of cats and other felids. Toxoplasma shows a
complete lack of species-specificity in the intermediate host and is capable
of infecting any warm-blooded animal and is an important zoonosis.
Sarcocystis is one of the most prevalent parasites of livestock and infects
mammals, including man, birds and lower vertebrates. About 130 species

host. Most Sarcocystis species, infecting man and domestic animals, are
final hosts.Sarcocystis infections in the intermediate host are usually
asymptomatic. Gastrointestinal disease is occasionally reported in man.
The closely related genus, Frenkelia, differs from Sarcocystis in that its
last generation meronts occur in the brain rather than in the muscles.
Neospora is a cause of paralysis in dogs and abortion in cattle. Recent
evidence indicates members of the dog family are the final hosts.
Species of Besniotia have been found in cattle, horses, deer, rodents,
primates and reptiles. Cats are the definitive hosts. The parasites develop
in connective tissue, particularly of the skin, causing skin thickening and
hair loss.
FamilyLANKESTERELLIDAE
Lankesterella occur in amphibians; Schellakia are found in reptiles

A single family, the Plasmodiidae, contains a number of genera of medical
and veterinary interest. All species are heteroxenous with merogony
Occuring in a vertebrate host, and sporogony in an invertebrate host. There

birds, a disease most common in the tropics and transmitted by biting
dipteran flies. The vectors differ, in that avian species of Plasmodium are
transmitted by mosquitoes; Haemoproteus by midges or hippoboscid flies;
and Leucocytozoon by Simulium spp.
Plasmodium species are currently organised into five subgenera, which are
distinguished by the morphological characteristics of the erythrocytic
stages of the parasites, by the morphological changes in their host cells
and by their preference for either mature erythrocytes or erythrocyte
precursors. They are distinguished from the genera Haemoproteus and
Leucocytozoon by the presence of merogony in circulating erythrocytes.
Avian malaria is a common mosquito-transmitted disease of wild birds
that infects domestic fowl and cage birds when suitable vectors and wild
reservoir hosts are present. There are over 30 species of Plasmodium
affecting birds, which differ widely in host range, geographical
distribution, vectors and pathogenicity. Species that infect domestic birds
occur in four of these five subgenera.
Within the family Plasmodiidae are species of Plasmodium which cause
malaria in humans, one of the most prevalent diseases of man in the
mosquitoes.
149
Suborder PIROPLASMORINA
Often referred to as *piroplasms', these parasites are found mainly in the
erythrocytes or leucocytes of vertebrates. No oocysts are formed and
reproduction in the vertebrate host is asexual with sexual reproduction
occurring in the invertebrate host. The piroplasms are heteroxenous with
known vectors ixodid or argasid ticks.
FamilyBABESIDAE
The genus Babesia are intra-erythrocytic parasites of domestic animals
and are transmitted by ticks in which the protozoan passes transovarially,
via the egg, from one tick generation to the next. The disease, babesiosis,
is particularly severe in naive animals introduced into endemic areas and
is a considerable constraint on livestock development in many parts of the
world.
Family THEILERIIDAE
The diseases caused by several species of Theileria are a serious
constraint on livestock development in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
The parasites, which are tick-transmitted, undergo repeated schizogony in
the lymphocytes, ultimately releasing small merozoites, which invade the
red cells to become piroplasms. Theileria are widely distributed in cattle
and sheep in Africa, Asia, Europe and Australia, have a variety of tick
inapparent to rapidly fatal.
Various species of Cytauxzoon occur as theilerialike piroplasms in the red
cells of wild animals. The genus differs from Theileria in that schizogony
Cytauxzoon is a cause of a fatal disease of domestic cats, characterised by
fever, anaemia and icterus, in southern USA. The reservoir hosts are wild
cats.
Phylum MICROSPORA
All Microspora are obligate intracellular parasites with unicellular spores,
the spore possessing an extrusion apparatus and a coiled polar tube,
150
typically filamentous, extending backwards to form a polar cap. Most are
parasites of insects.
Family NOSEMATIDAE
The Nosematidae have ellipsoidal or oval spores consisting of an external
wall, sporoplasm, a coiled polar tube and a polar capsule. The genus
Encephalitozoon is of minor significance in veterinary medicine, causing
disease in dogs, rabbits, other mammals and in humans.
Family ENTEROCYTOZOONIDAE
but has also been reported in dogs, cattle and other domestic animals. Its
significance in animal hosts is unknown.
Phylum CILIOPHORA
The ciliates of domestic animals all belong to the phylum, Ciliophora
[Individual organisms have a micronucleus containing a normal set of
chromosomes and active in reproduction, and a polyploid macronucleus,
involved in  vegetative functions. Ciliates have either simple cilia or
found in the cortex beneath the pellicle composed of ciliary basal granules
transverse binary fission and sexual reproduction by conjugation, in which
there is a transfer of micronuclear materials between individuals. Many
species of ciliates occur as harmless commensals in the rumen and
reticulum of ruminants, and the large intestine of equids. The only ciliate
of importance in veterinary medicine occurs in the family Balantidiidae.
Family BALANTIDIIDAE
The only genus of importance is Balantidium, which has an ovoid,
ellipsoidal body with elongate macronucleus and a single micronucleus
with a cytosome at the base of an anterior vestibulum. Balantidium has
worldwide distribution and is found in pigs, monkeys and man.
151
Family PYCNOTRICHIDAE
This family contains the genus Buxtonella, which has an ovoid, uniformly
ciliated body with a prominent curved groove and a cyathostome near the
anterior end. Buxtoneila has worldwide distribution and is found in the
caecum of cattle.
Family NYCTOTHERIDAE
The genus Nyctotherus are coprophilic, cilated protozoa with a peristome
at the anterior end, ending in a cytosome in the middle of the body.
Nycotherus is found in the faeces of various species of Chelonia and
vegetarian lizards, such as iguanas.

Pneumocytis is widely distributed in a wide range of healthy, domestic
and wild animals. Currently it is considered to be an opportunistic

significance in other hosts is not known
152
RICKETTSIA
Rickettsial organisms are parasitic, Gram-negative microorganisms,
associated with arthropods, which may act as vectors or primary hosts.
Whilst the Rickettsia are now generally considered to be in the bacterial
Kingdom, Monera, for historical reasons they are included within
 parasitological texts and for this reason have been retained.
Within the order, Rickettsiales, three families are recognised: the
Rickettsiaceae, the Bartonellaceae and the Anaplasmataceae.
Family RICKETTSIACEAE
This is the most important family, which, in vertebrates, are parasites of
tissue cells other than erythrocytes and are transmitted by arthropods. The
two main sub-families are the Rickettsieae, which are capable of infecting
suitable vertebrate hosts including humans, who may be the primary host
but are more often incidental hosts, and Ehrlichieae, most of which are
pathogenic in mammals.
Rickettsieae
Rochalimaea and Coxiella. Species of Rickettsia are the important human
pathogens but some species can affect dogs and cats and many have a
wildlife reservoir. With the exception of louse-borne typhus and trench
fever, all these human infections are zoonoses with no person-to-person or
distinguished within the genus: typhus group, spotted fever group and
scrub typhus group.
Species of Rochalimaea are the cause of trench fever in humans and the
disease is transmitted by lice.
The genus Coxiella has a single species with worldwide distribution and is
the cause of Q fever. Infection is enzootic in cattle, sheep and goats but
can cause severe disease in humans. The organism is widely disseminated
among wild mammals and birds and has been found in ixodid and argasid
ticks, gamasid mites and in human body lice (Pedicuius).
153
Ehrlichieae
Ehrlichieae are minute rickettsia-like organisms, which are pathogenic for
mammals, including humans. The genus of importance in veterinary
medicine, Ehrlichia spp, are found in leucocytes in the circulating blood
and are transmitted by ixodid ticks.
FamilyBARTONELLACEAE
Members of the Bartonellaceae are polymorphic, often rod-shaped
microorganisms which are distinguished from the Anaplasmataceae, by
cultural and structural characteristics. The Bartonellaceae include two
genera, Bartonella and Grahamella. Several species of Bartonella have
important zoonosis.
FamilyANAPLASMATACEAE
The Anaplasmataceae are very small, rickettsia-like particles occurring in
or on the erythrocytes of vertebrates and are transmitted by arthropods.
Two of the four genera, Anaplasma and Aegyptianella, are important
pathogens of domestic animals. Species of the other two genera,
Species of Anaplasma are very small (0.3-1.0 μm in diameter) parasites of
the erythrocytes of ruminants and are transmitted biologically by ticks and
mechanically by sucking flies, especially tabanids.
Aegyptianella infect a wide range of wild and domestic birds in the
warmer parts of the world and have been recorded from Africa, Asia and
southern Europe. The main vectors are ticks of the genus Argas
plasma. They are worldwide in their distribution and have been found in
domestic and wild mammals. Vectors include lice and mosquitoes.
Haemobartonella are coccoid or rod-shaped organisms located on or
The taxonomy of several species is subject to much debate and there is a
proposal to re-classify some species in the genera Eperythrozoon and

Haemobartonella into the bacterial genus Mycoplasma (class Mollicutes)
based on 16s rRNA gene sequences and phylogenetic analysis.

Diagnosis: Usually an incidental finding on postmortem
 producing white or red, blood-filled zig-zag tracts in the mucosa.
Epidemiology: Infection is very much dependent on the presence and
abundance of the intermediate hosts, principally coprophagous beetles of
the genera Aphodius,Onthophagus,Blaps, Caccobius

Paramphistomum cervi
Synonym: Paramphistomum explanatum
Common name: Rumen fluke
Predilection site: Rumen
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Paramphistomatidae
Description, gross: The adults are small, conical (pear-shaped)
maggot-like flukes about 1.0 cm long and light red in colour when fresh.
One sucker is visible at the tip of the cone and the other at the base. The
  o  ssl a ss l  sss ou s n
specimens having a pink colour.
Description, microscopic: The egg resembles that of Fasciola hepatica,
being large (about 130-180 μm), and operculate, but is clear rather than
yellow.
Definitive hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, deer, buffalo, antelope
Intermediate hosts: Water snails - principally Planorbis and Bulinus
Life cycle: Development in the snail intermediate host is similar to that of
Fascioia and under favourable conditions (26-30°C) can be completed in
158
development in the final host occurs entirely in the alimentary tract.
Following excystment in the duodenum the young flukes attach and feed
there for about 6 weeks before migrating forward to the forestomachs
where they mature. The prepatent period is between 7 and 10 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. They are of little veterinary
significance in Europe and America, but are occasionally the cause of
disease in the tropics and subtropics.
Pathogenesis: The adult parasites in the forestomachs are well tolerated,
even when many thousands are present and feeding on the wall of the
intestinal phase of the infection.
Clinical signs: In heavy duodenal infections, the most obvious sign is
diarrhoea accompanied by anorexia and intense thirst. Sometimes in
cattle, there is rectal haemorrhage following a period of prolonged
straining. Mortality in acute outbreaks can be as high as 90%.
Diagnosis: This is based on the clinical signs usually involving young
animals in the herd and a history of grazing around snail habitats during a
period of dry weather. Faecal examination is of limited value since the
acute disease occurs during the prepatent period. However, large numbers
of paramphistome eggs can sometimes be present in faeces during acute
disease as the intestinal phase may also be accompanied by large numbers
of adult flukes in the forestomach. Confirmation can be obtained by a
postmortem examination and recovery of the small pink-coloured,
immature flukes from the duodenal musosa and ileal contents.
Fig. 2.1 Adult Paramphistomum cervi in the forestomach.
159
Pathology: The immature flukes are embedded in the mucosa of the upper
ileum and duodenum and are plug feeders, and this can result in severe
erosion of the duodenal mucosa. In heavy infections these cause enteritis
characterised by oedema, haemorrhage, ulceration and associated anaemia
and hypoproteinaemia. At necropsy, the young flukes can be seen as
clusters of brownish pink parasites attached to the duodenal mucosa and
occasionally also in the jejunum and abomasum.
Epidemiology: Paramphistomosis often depends for its continuous
endemicity on permanent water masses, such as lakes and ponds, from
heavy rains. Paramphistome eggs deposited by animals grazing these areas
hatch and infect snails. Subsequent production of cercariae often coincides
with receding water levels making them accessible to grazing ruminants.
In other areas, the situation is complicated by the ability of the snails to
aestivate on dry pastures and become reactivated on the return of rainfall.
A good immunity develops in cattle, and outbreaks are usually confined to
young stock. However, adults continue to harbour low burdens of adult
parasites and are important reservoirs of infection for snails. In contrast,
sheep and goats are relatively susceptible throughout their lives.
Treatment: Resorantel and oxyclozanide are considered the anthelmintics
of choice against both immature and adult rumen flukes in cattle and
sheep.
160
Control: As in Fasciola gigantica, the best control is achieved by
animals to natural water. Even then snails may gain access to watering
troughs and regular application of a molluscicide at source or manual
removal of snails may be necessary.
Notes: There is confusion over the classification of paramphistomes and it
is likely that many described species, such as those listed below, are
synonymous.

Entamoeba bovis
Predilection site: Rumen
Parasite class: Sarcodina
Family: Endamoebidae
Description: Trophozoites are 5-20 μm in diameter. The smoothly
granular cytoplasm is filled with vacuoles of various sizes. The nucleus is
large with a large central endostome made up of compact granules, with a
row of chromatin granules of varying sizes around its periphery. The cysts
are 4-14 μm in diameter and contain a single nucleus when mature with
irregular clumps of chromatin granules. A large glycogen granule may or
may not be present.
Hosts: Sheep, goat
Life cycle: Trophozoites divide by binary fission. Before encysting the
amoebae round up, become smaller and lay down a cyst wall. Each cyst
has one nucleus. Amoebae emerge from the cysts and grow into
trophozoites.

ABOMASUM
Cattle can be parasitised by over 18 species of gastrointestinal nematodes.
important gastrointestinal nematode in cattle is Ostertagia ostertagi and
whilst the diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment and control are described in
detail for this parasite, details are similar for other gastrointestinal
nematodes.
Ostertagia ostertagi
Synonym: Ostertagia lyrata,Skrjabinagia lyrata
Common name: Brown stomach worm
Predilection site: Abomasum
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: Adults are slender, reddish brown worms with a short
    sg    a   gg
Description, microscopic: The cuticle in the anterior region is striated
transversely whereas the rest of the body is unstriated and bears around 30
longitudinal ridges. The brown spicules are slightly curved and divided in
2.3a). In the female, the vulva is sited about 1.5 mm from the posterior
and is covered with a flap. The tail tapers gradually and ends in a slender,
rounded tip.

(b)
Hosts: Cattle, deer and very occasionally goats
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. Eggs are passed in the faeces, and
under optimal conditions, develop within the faecal pat to the infective
third stage within 2 weeks. When moist conditions prevail, the L3 migrate
from the faeces on to the herbage. After ingestion, the L3 exsheaths in the
rumen and further development takes place in the lumen of an abomasal
gland. Two parasitic moults occur before the Ls emerges from the gland
around 18 days after infection to become sexually mature on the mucosal
surface. The entire parasitic life cycle usually takes 3 weeks, but under
certain circumstances many of the ingested L3 become arrested in
development at the early fourth larval stage (EL4) for periods of up to 6
months (also referred to as hypobiosis).
Geographical  distribution:   Worldwide.  Ostertagia   is  especially
important in temperate climates and in subtropical regions with winter
rainfall.
Pathogenesis: Large populations of O. ostertagi can induce extensive

larval development occurs.
In heavy infections of 40 000 or more adult worms the principal effects of
these changes are first, a reduction in the acidity of the abomasal fluid, the
pH increasing from 2.0 up to 7.0. This results in a failure to activate
pepsinogen to pepsin. There is also a loss of bacteriostatic effect in the
abomasum. Secondly, there is an enhanced permeability of the abomasal
epithelium to macromolecules.
The results of these changes are a leakage of pepsinogen into the
circulation, leading to elevated plasma concentrations, and the loss of
plasma proteins into the gut lumen, eventually leading to
hypoalbuminaemia. In addition, in response to the presence of the adult
parasites, the zymogen cells secrete increased amounts of pepsin directly
into the circulation.

Clinical signs: Bovine ostertagiosis occurs in two clinical forms. In
temperate climates with cold winters the seasonal occurence of these is as
follows:
Type I disease is usually seen in calves grazed intensively during their
first grazing season, as the result of larvae ingested 3-4 weeks previously;
in the northern hemisphere this normally occurs from mid-July onwards.
In type I disease, the morbidity is usually high, often exceeding 75%, but
mortality is rare provided treatment is instituted early
Type Il disease occurs in yearlings, usually in late winter or spring
following their first grazing season and results from the maturation of

animals in the group are affected; mortality in such animals can be high
unless early treatment with an anthelmintic effective against both arrested
and developing larval stages is instituted.
The main clinical sign in both type I and type II disease is a profuse
           
persistent and has a characteristic bright green colour. In contrast, in the
majority of animals with type Il, the diarrhoea is often intermittent and
anorexia and thirst are usually present. In both forms of the disease, the
loss of body weight is considerable during the clinical phase and may
reach20% in 7-10 days.
Diagnosis: In young animals this is based on:
1. The clinical signs of inappetence, weight loss and diarrhoea
2. The season. For example, in Europe type I occurs from July until
September and type II from March to May.
3. The grazing history. In type I disease, the calves have usually
been set-stocked in one area for several months; in contrast, type [I
from spring to mid-summer, then moved and brought back to the
original field in the autumn. Affected farms usually also have a
history of ostertagiosis in previous years.

1000 eggs per gram (epg) and are a useful aid to diagnosis; in type
II the count is highly variable, may even be negative and is of
limited value.
5. Plasma pepsinogen levels. In clinically affected animals up to 2
levels are 1.0 IU in non-parasitised calves). The test is less reliable
in older cattle where high values are not necessarily correlated with
large adult worm burdens but, instead, may reflect plasma leakage
6. Postmortem examination. Adult worms can be seen on close
inspectionof the abomasalsurface.Adult wormburdens are
typically in excess of 40 0o0, although lower numbers are often
found in animals which have been diarrhoeic for several days prior
male spicules (Fig. 2.3).
168
In older animals, laboratory diagnosis is more difficult since faecal egg
counts and plasma pepsinogen levels are less reliable.
Pathology: The developing parasites cause a reduction in the functional
gastric gland mass; in particular the parietal cells, which produce
hydrochloric acid, are replaced by rapidly dividing, undifferentiated,
non-acid-secreting cells. Initially, these cellular changes occur in the
parasitised gland (Fig. 2.4), but as it becomes distended by the growing
end result being a thickened hyperplastic gastric mucosa.
Macroscopically, the lesion is a raised nodule with a visible central
orifice; in heavy infections these nodules coalesce to produce an effect
reminiscent of morocco leather (Fig. 2.5). The abomasal folds are often
very oedematous and hyperaemic and sometimes necrosis and sloughing
of the mucosal surface occurs (Fig. 2.6); the regional lymph nodes are
enlarged and reactive.

Epidemiology  of ostertagiosis
temperate
countries of the northern hemisphere
Dairy herds
1. A considerable number of L3 can survive the winter on pasture
and in soil. Sometimes the numbers are sufficient to precipitate type
[ disease in calves 3-4 weeks after they are turned out to graze in
170
the spring. However, this is unusual and the role of the surviving L3
is rather to infect calves at a level which produces patent subclinical
infection and ensures contamination of the pasture for the rest of the
grazing season.
2. A high mortality of overwintered L3 on the pasture occurs in
spring and only negligible numbers can usually be detected by June.
This mortality, combined with the dilution effect of the rapidly
growing herbage, renders most pastures, not grazed in the spring,
safe for grazing after mid-summer. However, some L3 may survive
in the soil for at least another year and can subsequently migrate on
to the herbage.
3. Eggs deposited in the spring develop slowly to L3; this rate of
development  becomes  more rapid  towards mid-summer as
temperatures increase, and, as a result, the majority of eggs
around mid-July onwards. If sufficient numbers of these L3 are
Development from egg to L3 slows during the autumn.
4. As autumn progresses and temperatures decline an increasing
proportion (up to 80%) of the L3 ingested become inhibited at the
early fourth larval stage (EL4). In late autumn, calves can therefore
harbour many thousands of these EL4 but few developing forms or
adults.  These  infections  are  generally  asymptomatic  until
maturation of the EL4 takes place during winter and early spring
synchronous, clinical signs may not occur but the adult worm
burdens which develop can play a significant epidemiological role
by contributing to pasture contamination in the spring.
Two factors, one management and one climatic, appear to increase the
prevalence of type II ostertagiosis.
       s   d  
pasture, then moving these to hay or silage aftermath before returning
them to the original grazing in late autumn. Such pasture will still contain
many L3 and when ingested they will become arrested.
Secondly, in dry summers the L3 are retained within the crusted faecal pat
and cannot migrate on to the pasture until sufficient rainfall occurs. If
rainfall is delayed until late autumn many larvae liberated on to pasture
171
will become arrested following ingestion and so increase the chance of
type II disease.
Although primarily a disease of young dairy cattle, ostertagiosis can
nevertheless affect groups of older cattle in the herd, particularly if these
have had little previous exposure to the parasite.
Acquired immunity is slow to develop and calves do not achieve a
significant level of immunity until the end of their first grazing season.
Housing over the winter allows the immunity to wane by the following
spring and yearlings turned out at that time are partially susceptible to
reinfection and so contaminate the pasture with small numbers of eggs.
However, immunity is rapidly re-established and any clinical signs which
occur are usually of a transient nature. By the second and third year of
grazing, adult stock in endemic areas are usually highly immune to
reinfection and of little significance in the epidemiology. However,
heifers, there are reports of clinical disease following calving. Burdens of
adult Ostertagia spp in dairy cows are usually low and routine treatment
of herds at calving should not be required.
Beef herds
Although the basic epidemiology in beef herds is similar to dairy herds.
the influence of immune adult animals grazing alongside susceptible
calves has to be considered. Thus, in beef herds where calving takes place
u q unpod  ss uun si sisonso uds su u
adults is low, and the spring mortality of the overwintered L3 occurs prior
to the suckling calves ingesting significant quantities of grass.
Consequently, only low numbers of L3 become available on the pasture
later in the year. However, where calving takes place in the autumn or
winter, ostertagiosis can be a problem in calves during the following
grazing season once they are weaned, the epidemiology then being similar
to that for dairy calves.

Epidemiology of ostertagiosis in subtropical and
temperate countries in the southern hemisphere
[In countries with temperate climates, such as New Zealand, the seasonal
in the summer and burdens of arrested larvae accumulating in the autumn.
[n those countries with subtropical climates and winter rainfall, such as
parts of southern Australia, southwest Africa and some regions of
Argentina, Chile and Brazil, the increase in L3 population occurs during
the winter and outbreaks of type I disease are seen towards the end of the
winter period. Arrested larvae accumulate during the spring and where
type II disease has been reported it has occurred in late summer or early
    i  go  s s  
parts of the USA with non-seasonal rainfall, such as Louisiana and Texas.
There, larvae accumulate on pasture during winter and arrested
development occurs in late winter and early spring with outbreaks of type
II disease occurring in late summer or early autumn.
The environmental factors which produce arrested larvae in subtropical
zones are not yet fully known.
pro-benzimidazoles (febantel, netobimin and thiophanate), levamisole, 0r
the avermectins/milbemycins. All of these drugs are effective against
developing larvae and adult stages. Following treatment, calves should be
moved to pasture which has not been grazed by cattle in the same year.
For the successful treatment of type [I disease it is necessary to use drugs
which are effective against arrested larvae as well as developing larvae
and adult stages. Only the modern benzimidazoles (such as albendazole,
fenbendazole or oxfendazole)or the avermectins/milbemycins are
effective in the treatment of type II disease when used at standard dosage
levels, although the pro-benzimidazoles are also effective at higher dose
rates.
The field where the outbreak has originated may be grazed by sheep or
rested until the following June.
In lactating dairy cattle, topical eprinomectin has the advantage that there
is no milk withholding period.
173
treating young cattle with anthelmintics over the period when pasture
larval levels are increasing. However, it has the disadvantage that since
the calves are under continuous larval challenge their performance may be
also necessary using a drug effective against hypobiotic larvae in order to
prevent type II disease.
The prevention of ostertagiosis by limiting exposure to infection is a more
efficient method of control. This may be acheived by allowing young
cattle sufficient exposure to larval infection to stimulate immunity but not
sufficient to cause a loss in production. The provision of this 'safe pasture
may be achieved in two ways:
1. Using anthelmintics to limit pasture contamination with eggs
during periods when the climate is optimal for development of the
free-living larval stages, i.e. spring and summer in temperate
climates, or autumn and winter in the sub-tropics.
2. Alternatively, by resting pasture or grazing it with another host,
such as sheep, which are not susceptible to O. ostertagi, until most
of the existing L3 on the pasture have died out.
Sometimes a combination of these methods is employed. The timing of
events in the systems described below is applicable to the calendar of the
northern hemisphere.
Prophylactic anthelmintic medication
Since the crucial period of pasture contamination with O. ostertagi eggs is
the period up to mid-July, one of the efficient modern anthelmintics may
to minimise the numbers of eggs deposited on the pasture. For calves
going to pasture in early May two treatments, 3 and 6 weeks later, are
used, whereas calves turned out in April require three treatments at
intervals of 3 weeks. Where parenteral or pour-on macrocyclic lactones
are used the interval after first treatment may be extended to 5 or 8 weeks
(the interval depends on the anthelmintic used) due to residual activity
against ingested larvae.
Several rumen boluses are available which provide either the sustained
174
release of therapeutic doses of an anthelmintic at intervals of 3 weeks
throughout the grazing season. These are administered to first season
grazing calves at turnout and effectively prevent pasture contamination
and the subsequent accumulation of infective larvae. Although offering a
high degree of control of gastrointestinal nematodes there is evidence to

throughout the year on the same pasture and is particularly advantageous
for the small heavily stocked farm where grazing is limited.
Anthelmintic treatment and move to safe pasture in mid-July
This system, usually referred to as ‘dose and move',is based on the
knowledge that the annual increase of L3 occurs after mid-July. Therefore
 an o ue un e s    san j
early July and moved immediately to a second pasture such as silage or
hay aftermath, the level of infection which develops on the second pasture
will below.
The one reservation with this technique is that in certain years the
numbers of L3 that overwinter are sufficient to cause heavy infections in
the spring and clinical ostertagiosis can occur in calves in April and May.
However, once the ^dose and move’ system has operated for a few years
this problem is unlikely to arise.
In some European countries the same effect has been obtained by delaying
the turnout of calves until mid-summer.
Alternate grazing of cattle and sheep
Since the effective lifespan of most O. ostertagi L3 is under 1 year and
cross-infection between cattle and sheep in temperate areas is largely
limited to O. leptospicularis, Trichostrongyfus axei and occasionally C.
oncophora, good control of bovine ostertagiosis should, in theory, be
land suitable for cropping or grassland conservation. In marginal or
175
upland areas reasonable control has been reported using an annual rotation
of beef cattle and sheep. The drawback of alternate grazing systems is that
they impose a rigorous and inflexible regimen on the use of land.
Furthermore, in warmer climates where Haemonchus spp are prevalent,
this system can prove dangerous since this very pathogenic genus
establishes in both sheep and cattle.
Rotational grazing of adult and young stock
This system involves a continuous rotation of paddocks in which the
susceptible younger calves graze ahead of the immune adults and remain
long enough in each paddock to remove only the leafy upper herbage. The
incoming immune adults then graze the lower more fibrous echelons of
produced by the immune adults contains few if any O. ostertagi eggs, the
pasture contamination is greatly reduced. The optimal utilisation of
permanent grassland and the control of internal parasitism without resort
Notes: O. ostertagi is perhaps the most common cause of parasitic
gastritis in cattle. The disease, often simply known as ostertagiosis,
typically affects young cattle during their first grazing season, although
adult cattle.

two generations of meronts, and oocysts are produced in 72 hours. The
 prepatent period is unknown.
Geographical distribution: Reported in USA, Brazil, UK, Czech
Republic, Germany, France, Japan and Iran
Pathogenesis: Generally considered to be non-pathogenic

Speciation of Cryptosporidium is difficult, if not impossible, using
conventional  techniques.  A range of molecular and  immunological
immunofluorescence (IF) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA). More recently, DNA-based techniques have been used for the
molecular characterisations of Cryptosporidium species.
Pathology: The presence of the endogenous stages of the parasite leads to
destruction of the microvilli of peptic glands, leading to elevated
concentrations of plasma pepsinogen levels.
Epidemiology: The epidemiology of infection has not been studied
although it is likely to be similar to Cryptosporidium parvum in cattle.
Many calves are likely to become infected without showing clinical signs
but become sources of infection for calves that follow. The primary route
of infection is by the direct animal-to-animal faecal-oral route. Thus in
calves, for example, overcrowding, stress of early weaning, transport and

marketing, together with low levels of hygiene will increase the risk of
heavy infections.

characterisations have indicated that all bovine isolates are C. andersoni.

Trichostrongylus longispicularis
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are similar in size to T. cofubriformis.
181
Description, microscopic: The spicules are stout, brown, unbranched,
slightly unequal in length and terminate in a tapering blunt tip that has a
small semi-transparent protrusion.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, deer, camel, llama
Life cycle: This is direct and typically trichostrongyloid. See T.

Cooperia oncophora
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: In size C. oncophora is similar to Ostertagia but with
a large bursa. Males measure around 5.5-9 mm and females 6-8 mm in
length. When fresh the worms appear pinkish white.
        
cephalic vesicle and the transverse cuticular striations in the oesophageal
region (Fig. 2.7). The body possesses longitudinal ridges. The spicules
have a distinct wing-like expansion in the middle region and often bear
ridges (Fig. 2.8a); there is no gubernaculum. The females have a long
tapering tail. Eggs are oval and thin-shelled.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, deer
Life cycle: This is direct and typical of the superfamily. Ingested L3
exsheath, migrate into the intestinal crypts for two moults and then the
adults develop on the surface of the intestinal mucosa. The prepatent
period is around 3 weeks. The bionomic requirements of the free-living
stages are similar to those of Ostertagia.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
182
Pathogenesis: C. oncophora is generally considered to be a mild
pathogen in calves, although in some studies it has been associated with
inappetence and poor weight gains. A partial immunity to reinfection
develops after about 8-12 months of exposure to infective larvae.
Clinical signs: These are loss of appetite and poor weight gains.
Occasionally a heavy infection can induce intermittent diarrhoea.
Fig. 2.7 Anterior of Cooperia spp showing the cephalic vesicle and
cuticular striations.
Diagnosis: Eggs of Cooperia spp are all very similar morphologically.
Faecal culture will allow identification of infective larvae.
183
Pathology: Moderate to heavy infections can induce a catarrhal enteritis
with localised villous atrophy and oedema of the intestinal mucosa.

Epidemiology: In temperate areas, this is similar to that of Ostertagia.
Arrested development (hypobiosis) at the EL4 is a regular feature during
late autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere, and spring and
summer in the southern hemisphere. Adult animals usually show few
signs of infection but act as carriers, shedding low numbers of eggs in
their faeces.
In the subtropics, the epidemiology is similar to that of Haemonchus
though Cooperia does not have the same high biotic potential and the L3
survive rather better under arid conditions. Hypobiosis is also a feature
during prolonged dry seasons.
Treatment: The principles are similar to those applied in bovine
Ostertagiosis. Cooperia is one of the dose-limiting species and one should
consult the manufacturer's data sheets for efficacy of anthelmintics
against adult and L4 stages.
Control: Similar to that described for Ostertagia.
Notes: In temperate areas, members of the genus Cooperia usually play a
secondary role in the pathogenesis of parasitic gastroenteritis of ruminants
184
However, in some tropical and subtropical areas, some species are
responsible for severe enteritis in calves.
Three further species of Cooperia are found in cattle. Details of the
diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment and control are as for C. oncophord
Cooperiapunctata
Common name: Cattle bankrupt worm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda

Description, gross: Similar to C. oncophora. Males measure around
4.5-6.0 mm, and females 6-8 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: See C. oncophora and Fig. 2.8c for details.
Hosts: Cattle, deer
Life cycle: Similar to C. oncophora but the adults remain closely
associated with the mucosa and surface epithelium. The prepatent period
is around 2-3 weeks. The bionomic requirements of the free-living stages
are similar to Haemonchus.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide

that of other intestinal trichostrongylid species, which leads to villous
atrophy and a reduction in the area available for absorption. In heavy
infections, diarrhoea has been reported.
Clinical signs: There is loss of appetite, poor weight gains and diarrhoea
and there may be submandibular oedema.
Cooperiapectinata
Predilection site: Small intestine

Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: Similar to C. oncophora. Males measure around 78

Description, microscopic: See C. oncophora and Fig 2.8b for details.
Hosts: Cattle, deer
Life cycle: See C. punctata for details
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Similar to C. punctata. A catarrhal
enteritis is often present with loss of appetite, poor weight gain, diarrhoea,
and in some cases, submandibular oedema.

Life cycle: Similar to that of C. pectinata and C. punctata. The bionomic
requirements of the free-living stages concur with those for Haemonchus.
Geographical distribution: Parts of Europe, North America and
Australia
186
Pathogenesis: Moderate pathogenicity as the worms penetrate the surface
of the small intestine and can induce villous atrophy.
Clinical signs: See C. punctata.
Diagnosis: See C. oncophora
Treatment and control: Refer to C. oncophora
Nematodirus helvetianus
Common name: Thread-necked worm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are slender, males measuring around
11-16 mm and females 17-24 mm in length.
The male has two sets of parallel rays in each of the main bursal lobes and
the long, slender spicules end in a fused point with the surrounding
membrane being lanceolate. The female has a truncate tail with a small
spine, and the egg is large, ovoid and colourless and twice the size of the
typical trichostrongyle egg (Fig. 2.9).
Hosts: Cattle, occasionally sheep, goat and other ruminants
Life cycle: The preparasitic phase is almost unique in the
trichostrongyloids in that development to the L3 takes place within the egg
shell. N. heivetianus does not have the same critical hatching requirements
as N. battus (see Chapter 3) and so the larvae often appear on the pasture
within 2-3 weeks of the eggs being excreted in the faeces. More than one
annual generation is therefore possible. The parasitic phase within the host
is similar to that of N. battus. The prepatent period is around 3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Although this is similar to that of N. battus, there is some
controversy over the extent of the pathogenic effect. N. hefvetianus has
187
been incriminated in outbreaks of bovine parasitic gastroenteritis but
experimental attempts to reproduce the disease have been unsuccessful.
Clinical signs: Low to moderate infections may produce no obvious
clinical manifestations. In severe infections, diarrhoea can occur during
the prepatent period and young animals may become dehydrated.
Fig. 2.9 Large egg of Nematodirus helvetianus.
Diagnosis: Examination of faeces will allow the large colourless eggs to
be differentiated from those of N. spathiger. At necropsy, the tips of the
male spicules will allow diagnosis from other Nematodirus species.
Pathology: Increased mucus production and focal compression and
stunting of villi may occur in the small intestine.
188
Epidemiology: The eggs do not usually exhibit delayed hatching. The
pattern of infection is similar to that of Trichostrongyfus species.
Treatment: Several drugs are effective against Nematodirus infections;
levamisole, an avermectin/milbemycin or one of the modern
benzimidazoles. However, Nematodirus is one of the dose-limiting species
and manufacturer's data sheets should be consulted as there are
differences in efficacy against adults and L4 stages between oral and
parenteral administration for some macrocyclic lactones. The response to
treatment is usually rapid and if diarrhoea persists coccidiosis should be
considered as a complicating factor.

Bunostomum phlebotomum
Synonym: Monodontus phlebotomum
Common name: Cattle hookworm
Predilection site: Small intestine, particularly the anterior jejunum and/or
duodenum
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ancylostomatoidea
Description, gross: Bunostomum is one of the larger nematodes of the
small intestine of ruminants, being 1-3 cm long, stout, greyish white and
characteristically hooked at the anterior end with the buccal capsule
opening anterodorsally (Fig. 2.10).
Description, microscopic: The large buccal capsule opens anterodorsally

capsule but there are two pairs of small sub-ventral lancets at its base. In
the male the bursa is well developed and has an asymmetrical dorsal lobe.
The right externodorsal ray arises higher up on the dorsal stem and is
longer than the left. It arises near the bifurcation of the dorsal ray, which
divides into two tridigitate branches. The spicules are very long and
slender. In the female the vulva opens a short distance in front of the
middle of the body.
The infective larva is small with 16 gut cells and a short filamentous tail
Eggs are medium-sized (97 × 50 μm) irregular broad elipse, with
dissimilar sidewalls and four to eight blastomeres.

Ingested larvae usually develop without a migration. Further development
continues in the gut. The prepatent period is about 6 weeks after skin
penetration, and 7-10 weeks after ingestion.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
191
Pathogenesis: The adult worms are blood-suckers and infections of
loss of weight and occasionally diarrhoea. Worm burdens of around 2000
may lead to death in cattle. In stabled cattle, pruritus of the limbs,
probably caused by skin penetration by the larvae, is seen.
Clinical signs: There may be inappetence, diarrhoea and emaciation.
more frequently seen in young animals. Severe infection can also induce
submandibular oedema (*bottle jaw'). Postmortem examination often
reveals hydrothorax and fluid within the pericardium. Older livestock
frequently develop sufficient immunity to limit reinfection and in many
cases Bunostomum is present asymptomatically. In calves, foot stamping

Diagnosis: The clinical signs of anaemia and perhaps diarrhoea in calves
are not in themselves pathognomonic of bunostomosis. However, in
eliminating the possibility of Fasciola hepatica infection. In the tropics,
haemonchosis must be considered, possibly originating from hypobiotic
larvae. Faecal worm egg counts are useful in that these are lower than in
Haemonchus infection while the eggs are more bluntly rounded, with
relatively thick sticky shells to which debris is often adhered. For accurate
differentiation, larval cultures should be prepared.
Pathology: The carcase is anaemic and cachexic. Oedema and ascites are
seen. The liver is light brown and shows fatty changes. The intestinal
contents are haemorrhagic and the mucosa is usually swollen, covered
with mucus, and shows numerous lesions resulting from the worms

thelumen.
Epidemiology: Pathogenic infections are more common in the tropics and
sub-tropics and in some areas, such as Nigeria, the highest worm burdens
are found at the end of the dry season, apparently due to the maturation of
hypobiotic larvae. Young livestock are most susceptible. B. phiebotomum

high worm burdens are usually uncommon. The prophylactic dosing
regimes, adopted for the control of trichostrongyles, have contributed to
the low prevalence of Bunostomum.
192
Treatment: Anthelmintics listed for O. ostertagi are effective
Control: A combination of strategic dosing with anthelmintics and
pasture management is used in the control of larvae as they are susceptible
to dessication, and the infection is mainly found on permanently or
occasionally moist pastures. Avoiding or draining such pastures is an
effective control measure. The ground around water troughs should be
kept hard and dry, or treated with liberal applications of salt. Stabled cattle
should be protected by ensuring the floors and bedding are kept dry and
that faeces are removed frequently, and are not allowed to contaminate
food and water.
Agriostomum vryburgi

in length and a gubernaculum is present.
Description, microscopic: The shallow bucal capsule contains four pairs
of large teeth on its margin and has a rudimentary leaf-crown. The large
oesophageal opening houses two small subventral lancets. Eggs measure
about 130-190 × 60-90 μm.
Hosts: Cattle, buffalo, ox and zebu
Life cycle: The life cycle is probably direct.
Geographical distribution: Asia and South America
Pathogenesis: The hookworms attach to the mucosa of the anterior small
intestine. The pathogenicity, although unknown, presumably depends on
its haematophagic habits, inducing anaemia.
Notes: Agriostomum vryburgi is a common hookworm of the large
intestine throughout its distribution range.

Details on the diagnosis, treatment and control are likely to be similar to
B.phlebotomum.

Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Rhabditoidea

Toxocara vitulorum
Synonym: Neoascaris vitulorum
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Description, gross: This is a very large whitish nematode, the adult male
is up to 25 cm and the female 30 cm.
Description, microscopic: The cuticle is less thick than other ascarids
and somewhat soft and translucent. There are three lips, broad at the base
and narrowing anteriorly. The oesophagus is 3-4.5 mm long and has a
posterior, granular ventriculus. The tail of the male usually forms a small
the anterior pair is large and double. Pre-cloacal papillae are variable in
number. The vulva is situated about one eighth of the body length from
the anterior end. The egg of T. vitulorum is subglobular, with a thick
finely pitted shell, and is almost colourless (75-95 × 60-74 μm) (Fig
2.11).
Fig. 2.11 Egg of Toxocara vitulorum.
194
Hosts: Cattle, buffalo and zebu, rarely sheep and goats
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. The most important source of infection
is the milk of the dam in which larvae are present for up to 3-4 weeks
after parturition. There is no tissue migration in the calf following
milk-borne infection and the prepatent period is 3-4 weeks. The ingestion
of larvated eggs by calves over 6 months old seldom results in patency,
the larvae migrating to various tissues where they remain dormant; in
female animals, resumption of development in late pregnancy allows
further transmammary transmission.
Geographical distribution: Africa, India, Asia
Pathogenesis: The main effects of T. vitulorum infection appear to be
caused by the adult worms in the intestines of calves up to 6 months old.
Heavy infections are often associated with unthriftyness, catarrhal enteritis
and intermittent diarrhoea, and in buffalo calves particularly, fatalities
may occur. Heavy burdens can be associated with intestinal obstruction
and occasionally perforation may occur leading to peritonitis and death.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea, poor condition
195
Diagnosis: In some instances heavily infected calves may exhale an
acetone-like odour. The sub-globular eggs, with thick, pitted shells, are
characteristic in bovine faeces. Egg output in young calves can be very
high (>50 000 epg) but patency is short and by around 46 months of age,
calves have expelled most of their adult worm population.
Pathology: The pathological effects of adult worms in the intestine are
poorly defined. Heavy infections may obstruct the gut and lead to gut
perforation. Migration up the bile or pancreatic duct may lead to biliary
obstruction and cholangitis.
Epidemiology: The most important feature is the reservoir of larvae in the
tissues of the cow, with subsequent milk-borne transmission ensuring that
calves are exposed to infection from the first day of life. The majority of
patent infections occur in calves of less than 6 months of age.
Treatment: The adult worms are susceptible to a wide range of
anthelmintics, including piperazine, levamisole, macrocyclic lactones and
the benzimidazoles. Many of these drugs are also effective against
developing stages in the intestine.
Control: The prevalence of infection can be dramatically reduced by
treatment of calves at 3 and 6 weeks of age, preventing developing worms
reaching patency.
Capillaria bovis
Synonym: Capillaria brevipes
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: These are very fine filamentous worms, the narrow
Males measure around 8-9 mm and females up to 12 mm.
Description, microscopic: The males have a long thin single spicule
about 0.9 mm long and often possess a primitive bursa-like structure. The
eggs are barrelshaped (similar to Trichuris), 45-50 × 22-25 μm, are
196
colourless and have thick shells that are slightly striated with bipolar
plugs.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. The infective L1 develops within the
egg in about 3-4 weeks. Infection of the final host is through ingestion of
this embryonated infective stage and development to adult worms occurs
without a migration phase. The prepatent period is 3-4 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Considered to be of low pathogenicity and of little
veterinary significance.
Clinical signs: No clinical signs have been attributed to infection with this
parasite.
Diagnosis: Because of the non-specific nature of the clinical signs and the
fact that, in heavy infections, these may appear before eggs are present in
the faeces, diagnosis depends on necropsy and careful examination of the
small intestine for the presence of the worms. This may be carried out by
microscopic examination of mucosal scrapings squeezed between two
glass slides; alternatively the contents should be gently washed through a
fine sieve and the retained material resuspended in water and examined
against a black background.
Pathology: No associated pathology
common in sheep though not significant.
Treatment: Not usually required
Control: Not required
Moniezia benedeni
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Anoplocephalidae
197
Deseription, gross: These are long tapeworms, 2 metres or more, which
are unarmed, possessing prominent suckers.
Description, microscopic: Segments are broader than they are long (up to
2.5 cm wide) and contain two sets of genital organs grossly visible along
the lateral margin of each segment (Fig. 2.12). There is a row of
inter-proglottidal glands at the posterior border of each segment, which
may be used in species differentiation; in M. benedeni they are confined to
a short row close to the middle of the segment. The irregularly
quadrangular eggs have a well defined pyriform apparatus and vary from
55-75 μm in diameter.
Final host: Cattle
Intermediate hosts: Forage mites, mainly of the family Oribatidae.
Life cycle: Mature proglottids or eggs are passed in the faeces and on to
pasture where the oncospheres are ingested by forage mites. The embryos
cysticercoids in 1l-4 months and infection of the final host is by ingestion
 of infected mites during grazing. The prepatent period is approximately 6
weeks, but the adult worms appear to be short lived, patent infections
 persisting for only 3 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Fig. 2.12 Proglottids of Moniezia benedeni.
198
Pathogenesis: Generally regarded as of little pathogenic significance.
Clinical signs: No clinical signs have been associated with infection.
Diagnosis: This is based largely on the presence of mature proglottids in
the faeces and the characteristic shape of Moniezia eggs (triangular, M.
expansa; quadrangular, M. benedeni) that contain the oncosphere. The
eggs of M. benedeni are slightly larger than those of M. expansa (see
Chapter 3).
Pathology: No reported pathology.
Epidemiology: Infection is common in calves during their first year of
life and less common in older animals. A seasonal fluctuation in the
incidence of Moniezia infection can apparently be related to active periods
    s a  s    
cysticercoids can overwinter in the mites.
Treatment: In many countries a variety of drugs, including niclosamide.
praziquantel, bunamidine and a number of broad-spectrum benzimidazole
s         
gastrointestinal nematodes, are available for the treatment of Moniezia
199
infection. If this is carried out in calves in late spring, in temperate areas,
the numbers of newly infected mites on pasture will be reduced.
Control: Ploughing and reseeding, or avoiding the use of the same
pastures for young animals in consecutive years, may prove beneficial.
Notes: This genus of cestodes is common in ruminants and resembles, in
most respects, Anoplocephala of the horse. Moniezia spp are the only
tapeworms of ruminants in many countries of western Europe.
Thysaniezia ovilla
Synonym: Thysaniezia giardia
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Thysanosomidae
Description, gross: Adults reach 200 cm in length, varying in width up to
12 mm.
Description, microscopic: The scolex is small, measuring up to 1 mm in
diameter. Segments are short, bulge outwards giving the margin of the
 o  s       
rarely two, with genital pores alternating irregularly. Eggs are devoid of a
pyriform apparatus and are found in groups of 10-15 in elongated
paruterine organs (l00 μm long), with a thick grey shell and a
protruberance at one end.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, camel and wild ruminants
Intermediate hosts: Oribatid mites (Galuma, Scheloribates) and psocids
(bark lice, dust lice)
Life cycle: Mature segments are passed in the faeces of the infected host
on to pasture, where forage mites ingest the oncospheres. Cysticercoids
develop within the orabatid intermediate hosts and infection of the final
host is by ingestion of infected mites during grazing.
Geographical distribution: Southern Africa

Bovine coccidiosis
At least 13 different species of Eimeria are known to infect cattle. Clinical
signs of diarrhoea are associated with the presence of E. zuernii or E.
bovis, which occur in the lower small intestine, caecum and colon. E.
alabamensis, has been reported to cause enteritis in yearling calves in
some European countries. Affected animals develop watery diarrhoea,
shortly after turnout in the spring on to heavily contaminated pastures
previously grazed by calves.
The life cycles (where known) of the Eimeria species are typically
coccidian (see Chapter 1, Protozoa -Phylum: Apicomplexa). Following
ingestion of the sporulated oocyst there are several merogony stages
within the intestinal mucosa (usually two in those in which the life cycle
has been described). In some species, such as E. bovis, first-generation
   , s       
followed by smaller second-generation meronts. During gametogony,
fusion of macrogametocytes and microgametocytes leads to zygote
Sporulation outside the body may be completed in 1-4 days under ideal
conditions, but can take several weeks in cold weather. Sporulated oocysts
203
contain four sporocysts each containing two sporozoites. The life cycle
takes between 1 and 4 weeks depending on the species of Eimeria.
Prevalence
Most cattle are infected with coccidia during their lives and in the majority
of animals the parasites co-exist causing minimal damage. Disease usually
only occurs if they are subjected to heavy infection or if their resistance is

presence of infection does not necessarily lead to the development of
clinical signs of disease and in many situations low levels of challenge can

Pathogenesis
the crypt cells of the large intestinal mucosa (Table 2.1). This is because
the ruminant small intestine is very long, providing a large number of host
cells and the potential for enormous parasite replication with minimal
damage. [f the absorption of nutrients is impaired, the large intestine is, to
some extent, capable of compensating. Those species that invade the large
intestine are more likely to cause pathological changes, particularly if
large numbers of oocysts are ingested over a short period of time. Here,
the rate of cellular turnover is much lower and there is no compensation

dehydration and death. [n lighter infections, the effect on the intestinal
mucosa is to impair  local absorption. Species that develop more
superficially in the small intestines cause a change in villous architecture
with a reduction in epithelial cell height and a diminution of the brush
border giving the appearance of a 'flat mucosa'. These changes result in a
reduction of the surface area available for absorption and consequently a
reduced feed efficiency.

Clinical and pathological signs
Clinical signs are usually weight loss, anorexia and diarrhoea, often
bloody. On postmortem, there may be little to see beyond thickening and
petechiation of the bowel but mucosal scrapings will reveal masses of
gamonts and oocysts. Giant meronts may be seen in the mucosa of the
small intestine as pin-point white spots, but unless they are present in vast
          
gamonts.
Hostresistance
Whilst animals of all ages are susceptible to infection, younger animals
are generally more susceptible to disease. Occasionally, however, acute
coccidiosis occurs in much older, even adult, animals with impaired
cellular immunity or in those which have been subjected to stress, such as
transportation, crowding in feedlot areas, extremes of temperature and
weather conditions, changes in environment or severe concurrent
infection.
205
Epidemiology
Bovine coccidiosis is primarily a disease of young animals normally
occurring in calves between 3 weeks and 6 months of age but has been
reported in cattle aged 1 year or more. The disease is usually associated
with a previous stressful situation such as shipping, overcrowding,
changes of feed, severe weather or concurrent infection with parvovirus.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis should be based on history, clinical signs (severe diarrhoea in
young animals), postmortem findings (inflammation, hyperaemia and
thickening of caecum with masses of gamonts and oocysts in scrapings),
supported by oocyst counts and speciation to identify pathogenic species
(Fig. 2.13). Counts of faecal oocysts identified to species can help to
complete the picture, but oocyst numbers may be grossly misleading when
considered in isolation. Healthy animals may pass more than a million
0ocysts per gram of faeces whereas in animals dying of coccidiosis the
could mask significant numbers of the more pathogenic species, for
instance, and give the impression that the abundant species was the cause.
Chapter 15: The Laboratory Diagnosis of Parasitism (Table 15.6).

206
Treatment
Outbreaks of clinical coccidiosis can appear suddenly and may prove
troublesome to resolve as they often occur on heavily stocked farms,
particularly where good husbandry and management are lacking. If deaths
are occurring, early confirmation of the diagnosis is vital. Affected
animals should be medicated and moved to uncontaminated pens or
pasture as soon as possible.
Normally all animals in a group should be treated, as even those showing
no symptoms are likely to be infected. Severely infected animals that are
diarrhoeic and dehydrated may require oral or intravenous rehydration.
Where non-specific symptoms of weight loss or ill-thrift are present, it is
important to investigate all potential causes and seek laboratory
confirmation. If coccidiosis is considered significant, much can be done
through advice on management and instigation of preventative measures.

Prevention and control
Coccidial infections can be reduced through avoidance of overcrowding

Eimeriaalabamensis
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are usually 0void, 13-24 × 11-16 μm (mean 18.9 x
13.4 μm) with a smooth, colourless wall with no micropyle, polar body or
residuum. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal, 10-16 x 4-6 μm with a tiny Stieda
in the sporocysts and have one to three clear globules. First-generation
207
Second-generation meronts are 9-12 × 6-9 μm, ovoid or ellipsoidal in
shape and contain 18-26 merozoites.
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically coccidian with the developmental
stages occurring in the nucleus of epithelial cells. Sporozoites penetrate
the intestinal cells as early as day 2 after infection, and meronts are visible
in the nucleus from 2-8 days post infection. Parasitised cells are usually
those at the tips of the villi and multiple invasion of the nucleus may
first-generation meronts are seen 2-7 days post infection, and mature
gametocytes are found in the posterior third of the small intestine and may
also occur in the mucous membrane of the caecum and colon in heavy
infections. Oocysts may be seen in the cells of the lower ileum as early as
6 days post infection. The prepatent period is 6-11 days with a patent
period of 1-13 days. Sporulation takes 4-8 days.
Geographical distribution: Presumed worldwide, mainly Europe
Pathogenesis: Particularly pathogenic, attacking the epithelial cells of the
jejunum, ileum, and, in heavy infections, the caecum and colon.
Pathology: Infection causes catarrhal enteritis in the jejunum, ileum and
caecum with petechial haemorrhages. Histologically there is necrotic
inflammation and destruction of epithelial cells. There is an inflammatory
response consisting predominantly of mononuclear cells with a few
eosinophils and neutrophils. Numerous meronts are seen in the nuclel of
villous epithelial cells, with occasional meronts in the upper colon. The
mesenteric lymph nodes are enlarged, and parasite stages have been
observed in the lymph nodes
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea in calves recently turned out on to permanent
paddocks. The calves become depressed and reluctant to rise. From 8 days
after turnout, 850 000 to several million oocysts/g faeces are excreted.
Growth rate of the calves is adversely affected. Morbidity ranges from
5-100%, average 64%, but mortality is generally low.
Treatment: Sulphonamides can be used to treat infection. Decoquinate
has a prophylactic action against the parasite.
208
Control: Where infection is suspected to be due to oocysts overwintering
On the pasture, the grazing land should be rotated to ensure that calves are
not turned out on to potentially heavily infected pasture.
Infection with the following species of coccidia present in the small
intestine is not usually associated with clinical signs. Specific treatment
and control measures are not usually indicated for these species although
they often present as mixed infections. Differentiation is based on oocyst
morphology (see Table 15.5 and Figure 15.19).

Cryptosporidium parvum
Predilection site: Small intestine

μm (mean 5.0 × 4.5 μm) and a length:width ratio of 1.19.
213
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, horse, deer, man
Life cycle: The life cycle of Cryptosporidium is basically similar to those
of other intestinal coccidia although sporulation takes place within the
host. The oocysts, each with four sporozoites, are liberated in the faeces.
Following ingestion, the sporozoites invade the microvillous brush border
of the enterocytes and the trophozoites rapidly differentiate to form
meronts with four to eight merozoites. Gametogony follows after one to
two generations of meronts and oocysts are produced in 72 hours.
Evidence also indicates that two types of oocysts are produced. The first,
the majority, are thick-walled and are passed in the faeces. The remainder
are thin-walled and release their sporozoites in the intestine, causing
auto-infection.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Cryptosporidiosis is common in young calves, although the
pathogenesis of infection is not clear. It is remarkable in that, unlike other
members of the Eimeridae, Cryptosporidium does not enter the cells of
    o     
between domestic animals and man.
Clinical signs: Clinically the disease is characterised by anorexia and
diarrhoea, often intermittent, which may result in poor growth rates.
Diagnosis: Oocysts may be demonstrated using Ziehl-Nielsen stained
faecal smears in which the sporozoites appear as bright red granules (Fig.
2.14). Speciation of Cryptosporidium is difficult, if not impossible, using
conventional  techniques.  A range of molecular and  immunological
immunofluorescence (IF) (Fig. 2.15) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent
for the molecular characterisations of Cryptosporidium species.
Pathology: The meronts and gamonts develop in a parasitophorous
envelope, apparently derived from the microvilli and so the cell disruption
seen with other coccidia does not apparently occur. However, mucosal
changes are obvious in the ileum where there is stunting, swelling and
eventually fusion of the villi. This has a marked effect on the activity of
some of themembrane-bound enzymes.

Epidemiology: A variety of mammals act as hosts to C. parvum but little
is known of the importance of their involvement in transmitting infection
to, or maintaining infection in domestic livestock. In young calves
infection appears to be age related with seasonal peaks of disease reported
to coincide with birth peaks in spring and autumn. The first calves to be
born often become infected without showing clinical signs but become
sources of infection for calves that follow. Infection spreads rapidly, and

animals, it appears that infections usually originate from the same host

overcrowding, stress of early weaning, transport and marketing, together
lambs, chilling due to adverse weather conditions in the neonatal period,
intercurrent infections or nutritional or mineral deficiencies could
exacerbate or increase the likelihood of disease. Infection in these cases is
likely to occur through grooming, nuzzling, coprophagy, or by faecal
soiling by direct contact with infected animals. Infection may also occur
indirectly through consumption of contaminated foods or environmental
sources, including pasture and water.
Treatment: There is no known treatment, although spiramycin may be of
some value, and the infection is difficult to control since the oocysts are
highly resistant to most disinfectants except formol-saline and ammonia.
at a dose rate of 1 mg/10 kg. Symptomatic treatment may be given in the
form of anti-diarrhoeals and fluid replacement therapy.
Control: Good hygiene and management are important in preventing
disease from cryptosporidiosis. Feed and water containers should be high
colostrum within the first 24 hours of birth and overstocking and
overcrowding should be avoided. Dairy calves should be either isolated in
individual pens or kept in similar age groups and cleaned out daily. On
calf-rearing farms with recurrent problems, the prophylactic use of
halofuginone can be considered by treating for 7 consecutive days
commencing at 24-48 hours after birth
Notes: Recent molecular characterisations have shown that there is
extensive host adaptation in Cryptosporidium evolution, and many
mammals or groups of mammals have host-adapted Cryptosporidium
infectivity. These genotypes are now delineated as distinct species and
include, in cattle, C. parvum, C. bovis (also termed the bovine genotype or
genotype 2) and C. hominis (previously termed the human genotype).

Of epithelial cells.
Epidemiology: Molecular studies have revealed a substantial level of
genetic diversity in G. intestinalis isolates. Human isolates fall into two
major groups (assemblage A and B) with a wide host range in other
mammals and it may prove to be the case that separate species names may
be applicable. Other assemblages may also represent distinct species.
Limited epidemiological studies suggest that in animal isolates, direct
animal-to-animal contact and faecal soiling is the most likely method of
possible route. The incidence of these parasites varies but can be assumed
to be higher in some species than has been reported. Studies in Canada
and USA indicate levels of infection in cattle of up to 20% in clinically
normal animals and 100% infection rates in young diarrhoeic calves.
Treatment: There is no recommended treatment for infection in calves.
Several benzimidazole anthelmintics (e-g. albendazole, fenbendazole) are
effective and may prove to be of benefit.
Control: As infection is transmitted by the faecaloral route, good hygiene
and prevention of faecal contamination of feed and water is essential.
Notes: The parasite is important because of waterborne outbreaks that
have occurred in human populations. There is still controversy over the
classification of Giardia spp. The current molecular classification places
isolates into eight distinct assemblages. Some authors give separate
specific names to organisms isolated from different hosts, e.g. Giardia
219
bovis, although species specificity of many isolates is unknown.
Phylogenetic data suggest that G. intestinalis is a species complex
composed of several species that are host specific.

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: In O. radiatum infections in cattle, the pathogenic effect is

is one of the most damaging worms to cattle when present in high
numbers, with >200 adult worms in calves and >1000 adults in adult cattle

Effusion of tissue fluid and blood cells may be evident through small leaks
between cells, or from erosions in glands or on the surface. Although
repeated exposure to infective larvae may result in the accumulation of
large numbers of fourth-stage worms in nodules, formation of nodules has
little pathogenic significance in cattle.

Treatment:  Anthelmintic  therapy with broad-spectrum anthelmintics
(benzimidazoles, levamisole and avermectins/milbemycins) is highly
effective.

Control: Whilst not generally considered highly pathogenic,  a
combination  of  strategic  dosing  with   anthelmintics  and pasture
management, as used in the control of other nematodes, will also help to

anterior end that is characteristically embedded in the mucosa.
Description, microscopic: The male tail is coiled and possesses a single
spicule in a protrusible sheath. The sheath is covered with minute spines
characteristic eggs are lemon shaped, 70 × 35 μm, with a thick smooth
shell and a conspicuous polar plug (operculum) at both ends; in the faeces

the plugs are digested and the released L1 penetrate the glands of the distal
ileum, caecal and colonic mucosa. Subsequently, all four moults occur
within these glands, the adults emerging to lie on the mucosal surface with
their anterior ends embedded in the mucosa. The prepatent period is about
7-10 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
223
Pathogenesis: Most infections are light and asymptomatic. Occasionally.
when large numbers of worms are present, they cause a diphtheritic
inflammation of the caecal mucosa.
Clinical signs: Despite the fact that ruminants have a high incidence of
ruminants, is generally negligible, although isolated outbreaks have been
recorded.
Diagnosis: Since the clinical signs are not pathognomonic, diagnosis may
depend on finding numbers of lemon-shaped Trichuris eggs in the faeces.
Egg output is often low in Trichuris infections.
Pathology: In severe cases, the mucosa of the large intestine is inflamed,
haemorrhagic with ulceration and formation of diptheritic membranes.
Epidemiology: The most important feature is the longevity of the eggs,
which may still survive after 3 or 4 years. On pasture this is less likely
since the eggs tend to be washed into the soil.
Treatment:  In  ruminants the benzimidazoles,  the avermectins/
Trichuris, but less so against larval stages.
Control: Prophylaxis is rarely necessary in ruminants.
Notes: The adults are usually found in the caecum but are only

inconspicuous micropyle, no polar granule or oocyst residuum (see Fig.
2.13). Sporocysts are elongate ovoid, 13-18 × 5-8 μm and have an
inconspicuous Stieda body and a sporocyst residuum. The sporozoites are
225
elongate, and lie lengthwise head to tail in the sporocysts and usually have
a clear globule at each end.
Life cycle: There are two asexual generations. The first-generation
meronts are in the endothelial cells of the lacteals of the villi in the
posterior half of the small intestine, mature at 14-18 days after infection
Second-generation meronts occur in the epithelial cells of the caecum and
colon, but may extend into the last metre of the small intestine in heavy
infections. The sexual stages generally occur in the caecum and colon, but
may extend into the ileum in heavy infections; they appear 17 days after
5-15 days. The sporulation time is 2-3 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Particularly pathogenic, attacking the caecum and colon,
causing mucosal sloughing and haemorrhage.
Pathology: The most severe pathological changes occur in the caecum,
colon and terminal foot of the ileum, and are due to the gamonts. The
mucosa appears congested, oedematous and thickened with petechiae or
diffuse haemorrhages. The gut lumen may contain a large amount of
blood. Later in the infection the mucosa is destroyed and sloughs away.
The submucosa may also be lost. If the animal survives, both the mucosa
and submucosa regenerate.
Clinical signs: Severe enteritis and diarrhoea, or dysentery with tenesmus
in heavy infections. The animal may be pyrexic, weak and dehydrated,
and if left untreated, loses condition and may die.
Epidemiology: Disease is dependent on conditions, which precipitate a
massive intake of oocysts, such as overcrowding in unhygienic yards or
feedlots. It may also occur at pasture where livestock congregate around
water troughs.

not require to feed. Under optimal conditions the L3 stage is reached
within 5 days, but usually takes longer in the field. The L3 leave the faecal
pat to reach the herbage either by their own motility or through the agency
of the ubiquitous fungus, Pilobolus. After ingestion, the L3 penetrate the
  s       
moult. The L4 then travel via the lymph and blood to the lungs, and break
out of the capillaries into the alveoli about 1 week after infection. The
final moult occurs in the bronchioles a few days later and the young adults
then move up the bronchi and mature. The prepatent period is around 3-4
weeks.

pneumonia and typically affects young cattle during their first grazing
season on permanent or semi-permanent pastures. Pathogensis may be
divided into three phases:
(1) Pre-patent phase: around days 8-25. This phase starts with the
appearance of larvae within the alveoli where they cause alveolitis.
This is followed by bronchiolitis and finally bronchitis as the larvae
become immature adults and move up the bronchi. Towards the end
of this phase bronchitis develops, characterised by immature
lungworms in the airways and by cellular infiltration of the
epithelium. Heavily infected animals, whose lungs contain several
thousand developing worms, may die from day 15 onwards due to
respiratory failure following the development of severe interstitial
emphysema and pulmonary oedema.
          
main lesions. First, a parasitic bronchitis characterised by the
presence of hundreds or even thousands of adult worms in the
frothy white mucus in the lumina of the bronchi (Fig. 2.20).
Secondly, the presence of dark red collapsed areas around infected
bronchi (Fig. 2.21). This is a parasitic pneumonia caused by the
aspiration of eggs and L1 into the alveoli.
234
(3) Post-patent phase: around days 61-90. [n untreated calves, this
is normally the recovery phase after the adult lungworms have been
expelled. Although the clinical signs are abating, the bronchi are
still   inflamed  and  residual  lesions  such  as bronchial  and
peribronchial fibrosis may persist for several weeks or months.
normal and coughing ceases. However, in about 25% of animals,
which have been heavily infected, there can be a flare-up of clinical
signs during this phase, which is frequently fatal. This is caused by
one of two entities. Most commonly, there is a proliferative lesion
so that much of the lung is pink and rubbery and does not collapse
whenthe chest isopened.
This,  often  described
as
‘epithelialisation', is due to the proliferation of type 2 pneumocytes
on the alveoli giving the appearance of a gland-like organ. Gaseous
exchange at the alveolar surface is markedly impaired and the lesion
is often accompanied by interstitial emphysema and pulmonary

dissolution and aspiration of dead or dying worm material into the
alveoli. The clinical syndrome is often termed postpatent parasitic
bronchitis. The other cause, usually in animals convalescing
indoors, is a superimposed bacterial infection of the imperfectly
healed lungs leading to acute interstitial pneumonia.
Fig. 2.21 Typical distribution of pneumonic lesions of parasitic bronchitis
235
Clinical signs: Within any affected group, differing degrees of clinical
severity are usually apparent.  Mildly  affected animals cough
intermittently, particularly when exercised. Moderately affected animals
have frequent bouts of coughing at rest, tachypnoea (60 respirations per
minute) and hyperpnoea. Frequently, squeaks and crackles over the
posterior lung lobes are heard on auscultation. Severely affected animals
show severe tachypnoea (80 respirations per minute) and dyspnoea and
frequently adopt the classic ‘air-hunger” position of mouth breathing with
the head and neck outstretched. There is usually a deep harsh cough,
squeaks and crackles over the posterior lung lobes, salivation, anorexia
and, sometimes, mild pyrexia. Often the smallest calves are most severely
affected.
Calves may show clinical signs during the prepatent period and
occasionally a massive infection can cause severe dyspnoea of sudden
onset often followed by death in 24-48 hours.
Most animals gradually recover, although complete return to normality
may take weeks or months. However, a proportion of convalescing calves
suddenly develop severe respiratory signs, unassociated with pyrexia.

Diagnosis: Usually the clinical signs, the time of the year and a history of
grazing on permanent or semipermanent pastures are sufficient to enable a
diagnosis to be made.
236
Larvae are found (50-1000/g) only in the faeces of patent cases so that
faecal samples should be obtained from the rectum of a number of
opened bronchi and their size is diagnostic. A lungworm ELISA can be
used to detect antibodies to D. viviparus. Seroconversion takes 4-6 weeks
and titres persist for 4-7 months. Serology can be helpful in cases of
reinfection husk, as it will often detect larval stages. Cross-reactivity
requires validation and setting of appropriate optical density (OD) cut-off
values when interpreting results.
Pathology:

Epidemiology: Generally only calves in their first grazing season are
clinically affected, since on farms where the disease is endemic older
animals have a strong acquired immunity. In endemic areas in the northern
hemisphere infection may persist from year to year in two ways:
· Overwintered larvae: L3 may survive on pasture from autumn until
late spring in sufficient numbers to initiate infection or occasionally
to cause disease.
·Carrier animals: small numbers of adult worms can persist in the
bronchi, particularly in yearlings, until the next grazing season.
Chilling of infective larvae before administration to calves will
produce arrested Ls; hypobiosis at this stage has also been observed
in naturally infected calves in Switzerland, Austria and Canada.

relatively inactive. This fungus, Pilobolus, is commonly found growing on
the surface of bovine faecal pats about l week after deposition. The larvae
of D. viviparus migrate in large numbers up the stalks of the fungi on to,
and even inside, the sporangium or seed capsule (Fig. 2.22). When the
sporangium is discharged it is projected a distance of up to 3 m in still air
to land on the surroundingherbage.

usually not apparent until calves, turned out to graze in the spring, have
been at grass for 2-5 months. One explanation is that the initial infection,
acquired from the ingestion of overwintered larvae in May, involves so
few worms that neither clinical signs nor immunity is produced; however,
sufficient numbers of larvae are seeded on to the pasture so that by July
the numbers of L3 are sufficient to produce clinical disease. Young calves,
added to such a grazing herd in July, may develop clinical disease within
2-3weeks
only migrate on to pasture at some point between June and October.
Although dairy or dairy-cross calves are most commonly affected,
autumn-born single-suckled beef calves are just as susceptible when
turned out to grass in early summer. Spring-born suckled beef calves
grazed with their dams until housed or sold do not usually develop clinical
signs, although coughing due to a mild infection is common. However, the
typical disease may occur in weaned calves grazed until late autumn.
In tropical countries, where disease due to D. viviparus may occur
intermittently, the epidemiology is presumably quite different and
probably depends more on pasture contamination by carrier animals such

clinical signs in one or more animals with a possible fatal termination.
Whatever treatment is selected, it is advisable to divide affected calves
into two groups, as the prognosis will vary according to the severity of the
disease. Those calves which are only coughing and/or tachypnoeic are

Calves in this category may not have developed a strong immunity and
after treatment should not be returned to grazing which was the source of
infection; if this is not possible, parenteral ivermectin, doramectin or
239
moxidectin may be used since their residual effect prevents reinfection for
an extended period.
Any calves which are dyspnoeic, anorexic and possibly pyrexic should be
kept indoors for treatment and further observation. The prognosis must be
guarded as a proportion of these animals may not recover while others
may remain permanently stunted. In addition to anthelmintics, severely

immunise all young calves with lung-worm vaccine. This live attenuated
vaccine is currently only available in parts of Europe and is given orally to
calves aged 8 weeks or more. Two doses of vaccine are given at an
interval of 4 weeks and, in order to allow a high level of immunity to
develop, vaccinated calves should be protected from challenge until 2
weeks after their second dose. Dairy calves or suckled calves can be
vaccinated successfully at grass provided the vaccine is given prior to
encountering a significant larval challenge.
Although vaccination is effective in preventing clinical disease, it does not
completely prevent the establishment of small numbers of lungworms.

should be vaccinated whether they go to pasture in the spring or later in
the year and a vaccination programme must be continued annually for
each calf crop

boluses, as recommended in the control of bovine ostertagiosis. The
danger of these measures, however, is that through rigorous control in the
first grazing season, exposure to lungworm larvae is so curtailed that cattle
remain susceptible to husk during their second season; in such situations it
may be advisable to consider vaccination prior to their second year at
grass.
Because of the unpredictable epidemiology, the technique commonly used
in ostertagiosis of ^dose and move' in midsummer does not prevent
parasitic bronchitis.
240
Parasitic bronchitis in adult cattle
Parasitic bronchitis is only seen in adult cattle under two circumstances:
1. As a herd phenomenon, or in a particular age group within a herd,
if they have failed to acquire immunity through natural challenge in
earlier years. Such animals may develop the disease if exposed to
heavy larval challenge, as might occur on pasture recently vacated
by calves suffering from clinical husk.
2. Disease is occasionally seen where an individual adult is penned
in a heavily contaminated calf paddock
The disease is most commonly encountered in the patent phase although

sign.
[n selecting an anthelmintic for treatment, one should consider the
withdrawal period of milk for human consumption. Eprinomectin has no
withdrawal period for milk
The reinfection syndrome in parasitic bronchitis
Normally the natural challenge of adult cattle, yearlings or calves, which
by vaccination, is not associated with clinical signs. Occasionally,
however, clinical signs do occur to produce the *reinfection syndrome',
which is usually mild, but sometimes severe. [t arises when an immune
animal is suddenly exposed to a massive larval challenge that reaches the
lungs, and migrates to the bronchioles where the larvae are killed by the
immune response. The proliferation of lymphoreticular cells around dead

slight tachypnoea over a period of a few days; less frequently there is
marked tachypnoea, hyperpnoea and, in dairy cows, a reduction in milk
yield. Deaths rarely occur. It can be difficult to differentiate this syndrome
from the early stages of a severe primary infection. The only course of
action is treatment with anthelmintics and a change of pasture.

Pneumocystis carinit
Synonym: Pneumocystis jiroveci
Common name: Pneumocystosis
Predilection site: Lung
Parasite class: Archiascomycetes
Family: Pneumocystidaceae
Description: Two major forms of P. carinii have been consistently
identified from histological and ultrastructural analysis of organisms
found in human and rat lung. These are a trophic form and a larger cyst
stage containing eight intracystic stages.
Hosts: Man, cattle, rat, ferret, mouse, dog, horse, pig, and rabbit
Life cycle: The life cycle of Pneumocystis still remains poorly
understood. [nformation is mostly derived from histochemical and
ultrastructural analysis of the lung tissue of rodents and infected humans.
The presumed life cycle of Pneumocystis includes an asexual and a sexual
growth phase. Current knowledge suggests that the trophic (trophozoite)
forms are produced during asexual development. These forms are usually
pleomorphic and found in clusters. They appear capable of replicating
asexually by binary fission and also replicate sexually by conjugation.
producing a diploid zygote, which undergoes meiosis and subsequent
mitosis, resulting in the formation of a precyst initially, and then an early
cyst and a mature cyst eventually. During differentiation of the organism
from precyst to mature cyst, eight intracystic spores or 'daughter cells’ are
cyst ruptures and develop into trophic forms.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Pneumocystis is one of the major causes of opportunistic
mycoses in the immunocompromised, including those with congenital
242
immunodeficiencies, retrovirus infections such as AIDS, and cases
Clinical signs: Infections in animals are generally asymptomatic. [In
humans, pneumocystosis is observed in four clinical forms; asymptomatic
infections, infantile (interstitial plasma cell) pneumonia, pneumonia in
Diagnosis: Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) and Giemsa stain may
be used for microscopic visualisation of Pneumocystis. Toluidine blue
(TBO) is the most effective for cyst stages while Giemsa stains are used to
show trophozoites. Axenic culture methods have been described; however,
in vitro cultivation, especially from clinical samples, is not always
successful. Fluorescence antibody staining techniques can be used to
detect both cyst and trophozoite stages of P. carinii. A number of
polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) have been reported which amplify
specific regions of DNA from P. carinii and are approximately 1oo times
more sensitive than conventional staining techniques.

detected by a silver staining procedure. A foamy eosinophilic material is

masses of the organism, alveolar macrophages, desquamated epithelial
alveolar cells, polymorphonuclear leucocytes and other host cells.
Epidemiology: The organism is apparently quite widely distributed in
latent form in healthy individuals and in the dog, as well as a wide variety
of other domestic and wild animals. The organism is thought to be
transmitted by aerosol, although the natural habitats and modes of
Pneumocystis DNA has been detected in air and water, suggesting that the
free forms of the organism may survive in the environment long enough to
infect a susceptible host. However, little information on the means of
transmission exists currently. In humans, infections appear to spread
between immunosuppressive patients colonised with Pneumocystis, and
different and host-specific, suggesting that zoonotic transmission does not
occur.
243
detected P. carinii pneumocysts in 3.8% of calves, 3.6% of sheep and
6.7% of pigs. Studies in Japan detected P. carinii in cattle and a wide
caused pneumonia in weaning pigs.
Treatment: Trimethroprim-sulphamethoxazole is the drug of choice for
treatment and prophylaxis of Pneumocystis infections. Pentamidine and
atovaquone are the alternative therapeutic agents in humans.
Control: Control is difficult given that the details of the routes of
transmission are unknown. Infection is generally as ymptomatic in animals
and is only likely to be detected in immunocompromised individuals.
this microorganism later proved to be a separate genus and was named
Pneumocystis carinii and classified as a protozoan until the late 1980s.
Following further taxonomic revision, Pneumocystis is now classified as a
fungus, not a protozoan. The taxonomy is still complicated in that
appear to be multiple species in this genus. Genetic variations and DNA
sequence polymorphisms are often observed, suggesting the existence of
numerous strains even within a single species of Pneumocystis.

65-90 μm), and about twice the size of a trichostrongyle egg.
Final hosts: Sheep, cattle, goat, horse, deer, man and other mammals
Intermediate hosts: Snails of the genus Lymnaea. The most common,
Lymnaea (syn Gaiba) truncatuia, is an amphibious snail with a wide
distribution throughout the world. Other important Lymnaea vectors of F.

L. bulimoides North and Southern USA and the Caribbean
L. humilis North America
L. viator
South America
L. diaphena South America
L. cubensis South America
L.viridis
China, Papua New Guinea
Life cycle: Adult flukes in the bile ducts shed eggs into the bile, which
enter the intestine. Eggs passed in the faeces of the mammalian host
develop and hatch, releasing motile ciliated miracidia. This takes 9-10
days at optimal temperatures of 22-26°C and little development 0ccurs
below 1o°C. The liberated miracidium has a short life-span and must
locate a suitable snail within about 3 hours if successful penetration of the
latter is to occur. In infected snails, development proceeds through the
sporocyst and redial stages to the final stage in the intermediate host, the
cercaria; these are shed from the snail as motile forms, which attach
themselves to firm surfaces, such as grass blades, and encyst there to form
the infective metacercariae. It takes a minimum of 6-7 weeks for
completion of development from miracidium to metacercaria, although
under unfavourable circumstances a period of several months is required.
Infection of a snail with one miracidium can produce over 600
metacercariae. Metacercariae ingested by the final host excyst in the small
intestine, migrate through the gut wall, cross the peritoneum and penetrate
the liver capsule. The young flukes tunnel through the liver parenchyma
for 6-8 weeks, then enter the small bile ducts where they migrate to the
larger ducts and occasionally the gallbladder and reach sexual maturity.
The prepatent period is 10-12 weeks. The minimal period for completion
of one entire life cycle of F. hepatica is therefore 17-l8 weeks. The
usually less than l year.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: This varies according to the number of metacercariae
ingested, the phase of parasitic development in the liver and the species of

liver damage and haemorrhage. The second occurs when the parasite is in
the bile ducts, and results from the haematophagic activity of the adult
flukes and from damage to the biliary mucosa by their cuticular spines.
Most studies have been in sheep and the disease in this host is discussed in
more detail in Chapter 3. The seasonality of outbreaks is that which occurs
in western Europe.
Although acute and subacute disease may occasionally occur under
conditions of heavy challenge, especially in young calves, the chronic
form of the disease is by far the most important, and as in sheep, is seen in
the late winter/early spring.
The pathogenesis is similar to that in sheep but has the added features of
calcification of the bile ducts and enlargement of the gallbladder. The
calcified bile ducts often protrude from the liver surface, giving rise to the
term ^pipe-stem liver'. Aberrant migration of the flukes is more common
in cattle and encapsulated parasites are often seen in the lungs. On
reinfection of adult cows, migration to the fetus has been recorded,
fasciolosis increases the susceptibility of cattle to infection with
Salmonelladublin.

burdens, the clinical effect is minimal and the loss of productivity is
difficult to differentiate from inadequate nutrition. It must be emphasised
that diarrhoea is not a feature of bovine fasciolosis unless it is complicated
by the presence of Ostertagia spp. Combined infection with these two
 parasites has been referred to as the fasciolosis/ostertagiosis complex.
Fasciola infections may cause a loss of production in milking cows during
winter. Clinically, these are difficult to detect since the fluke burdens are
usually low and anaemia is not apparent. The main effects are a reduction
in milk yield and quality, particularly of the solids-non-fat component.
Clinical signs: In heavy infections in cattle, where anaemia and
hypoalbuminaemia are severe, submandibular oedema frequently occurs.
With smaller fluke burdens, the clinical effect is minimal and the loss of
productivity is difficult to differentiate from inadequate nutrition. It must
be emphasised that diarrhoea is not a feature of bovine fasciolosis unless it
is complicated by the presence of Ostertagia spp. Combined infection
with these two parasites has been referred to as the fasciolosis/
Ostertagiosiscomplex.
248
Diagnosis: This is based primarily on clinical signs, seasonal occurrence,
prevailing weather patterns, and a previous history of fasciolosis on the
farm or the identification of snail habitats. While diagnosis of ovine
fasciolosis should present few problems, especially when a postmortem
examination is possible, diagnosis of bovine fasciolosis can sometimes
prove difficult. In this context, routine haematological tests and
examination of faeces for fluke eggs (note: eggs of Fasciola are browny
yellow and eggs of Paramphistomidae are colourless) are useful and may
be supplemented by two other laboratory tests.
The first is the estimation of plasma levels of enzymes released by
damaged liver cells. Two enzymes are usually measured. Glutamate
dehydrogenase (GLDH) is released when parenchymal cells are damaged
           s
epithelial cells lining the bile ducts; elevation of this enzyme takes place
mainly after the flukes reach the bile ducts and raisedlevels are
maintained for a longer period. The second test is the detection of
antibodies against components of flukes in serum or milk samples, the
ELISA and the passive haemagglutination test being the most reliable.
Pathology: In cattle, the pathogenesis is similar to that seen in sheep with
the added features of calcification of the bile ducts and enlargement of the
giving rise to the term *pipe-stem liver' (Fig. 2.25). Aberrant migration of
the flukes is more common in cattle and encapsulated parasites are often
seen in the lungs.
Epidemiology: For a more detailed description, see entry under sheep.

At present there is only one drug, triclabendazole, which will remove the

Apart from triclabendazole, the two drugs most commonly used for
subacute or chronic fasciolosis are nitroxynil and oxyclozanide, and
several others, such as clorsulon and niclofolan, are also marketed in some
countries. Albendazole, ricobendazole and netobimin are also effective
against adult fluke at an increased dosage rate. In lactating cows, where
the milk is used for human consumption, the above drugs are either
banned or have extended  withdrawal periods.  An exception
IS
oxyclozanide, which is licensed for use in lactating animals in many
countries and has a milk-withholding time of up to 3 days. Resistance to
flukicides is not a problem in cattle.
250
Control: Control of fasciolosis may be approached in two ways: by
reducing populations of the intermediate snail host or by using
anthelmintics (for a more detailed description see entry under sheep). The
timing of treatments will depend on the spectrum of activity of the
flukicide. A typical treatment schedule in the northern hemisphere in an
average rainfall season would be:
· Dose cattle in autumn with a flukicide, which is effective against
young immature fluke to reduce liver damage from fluke migration.
This is irrespective of whether cattle will be housed or outwintered.
· Dose grazing cattle in winter with a flukicide, which is effective
against adult fluke and immature stages. In-wintered cattle need to
be treated after housing (timing of the dose varies with the flukicide
used).
·Dose out-wintered cattle in spring with a flukicide, which is
effective against adult stages. This will remove fluke burdens and
reduce contamination of pastures with fluke eggs and thus reduce
the summer infection of snails.
for treatment. The use of meteorological forecasting of fasciolosis is
described in detail under sheep.
Fasciolagigantica
Common name: Tropical large liver fluke
Predilection site: Liver
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Fasciolidae
Description, gross: The adult fluke is larger than F. hepatica, the body is
more transparent, and can reach 7.5 cm in length and 1.5 cm in breadth.
The shape is more leaf-like, the conical anterior end is very short and the
shoulders, characteristic of F. hepatica, are barely perceptible (Fig
2.23b).
measuring 170-190 × 90-100 μm.
Final hosts: Cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat, pig, camel, deer, man
251
southern Europe it is L. auricuiaria, which is also the important species in
the southern USA, the Middle East and the Pacific [slands. Other
important Lymnaea vectors of F.gigantica are:
L.natalensisAfrica
L.rufescens
Indian subcontinent
L. acum inataIndian subcontinent
L. rubiginosaSoutheast Asia
L. viridis
China and Japan
All these snails are primarily aquatic snails and are found in streams,
irrigation channels and marshy swamps.
Life cycle: This is similar to F. hepatica, the main differences being in the
timescale of the cycle. The immature stages migrate through the liver
parenchyma, the adults reaching the bile ducts about 12 weeks after
   n    s s  
13-16 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Africa, Asia, Europe, USA
Clinical signs: Clinical signs are similar to those of F. hepatica
Diagnosis: This is based primarily on clinical signs, seasonal occurrence,
prevailing weather patterns and a previous history of fasciolosis on the
farm or the identification of snail habitats. Diagnosis can be confirmed by
the identification of the typical operculate eggs in faeces samples.
Pathogenesis: Acute and chronic infection occurs in sheep but only the
chronic form predominates in cattle. Like F. hepatica, F. gigantica is
capable of infecting man.
Pathology: The pathology is similar to that described for F. hepatica. In
cattle, the pathology is similar to that seen in sheep with the added
giving rise to the term 'pipe-stem liver'.
Epidemiology: The snails, which carry the larval stages of F. gigantica,
are primarily aquatic and as a result the disease is associated with animals
252
grazing on naturally or artificially flooded areas or around permanent
water channels or dams. [n subtropical or tropical countries with distinct
wet and dry seasons, it appears that optimal development of eggs to
miracidia occurs at the start of the wet season and development within the
snail is complete by the end of the rains. Shedding of cercariae then
commences at the start of the dry season when the water level is still high
and continues as the water level drops. Under laboratory conditions, a
rather than on herbage, and under natural conditions this could have a very
significant effect on the dissemination of infection. Metacercariae are
acquired by animals utilising such areas during the dry season and clinical
problems, depending on the rate of infection, occur at the end of that
season or at the beginning of the next wet season. Metacercariae encyst on
plants under water, such as rice plants, and can survive for up to 4 months
on stored plants, such as rice straw.
Treatment: The drugs and dose rates given for the treatment of F.
hepatica are also generally applicable for the treatment of F. gigantica.
Only triclabendazole and clorsulon are effective against both mature and
immature stages of F. gigantica in cattle.
Control: The principles are the same as for the control of F. hepatica and
are based on the routine use of anthelmintics together with measures to
reduce populations of the snail intermediate host. There is, however, the
important difference that the latter are water snails whose control depends
on a different approach from that for the mud snail, L. truncatufa.
Routine anthelmintic treatment of animals at seasons when heavy
infections of adult flukes accumulate in the host is recommended using a
drug effective against adult and immature flukes. This should prevent
serious losses in production, but for optimal benefit should be
accompanied by snail control.
When watering of stock is from a reservoir or stream, complete control
To do this effectively from streams, the water may require to be pumped
and in remote areas simple water-driven pumps whose power source
depends on the water flow have been found useful. It is important that the
by snails.
253
When grazing depends on the dry season use of marshy areas around
receding lakebeds, snail control is difficult. Molluscicides are usually
impractical because of the large body of water involved and their possible
effect on fish, which may form an important part of the local food supply.
Apart from repeated anthelmintic treatment to prevent patency of acquired
infections of F. gigantica, there is often little one can do. Ideally, such
areas are often best suited to irrigation and the growing of cash crops, the
supply to cattle.
Fascioloides magna
Common name: Large American liver fluke
Predilection site: Liver and bile ducts
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Fasciolidae
Description, gross: Flukes are large and thick and measure up to 10 × 2.5
cm. The flukes are oval, with a rounded posterior end. They possess no
anterior cone and when fresh are flesh-coloured.
Description, microscopic: Eggs are large, operculate, measure 109-168 ×
75-96 μm and have a protoplasmic appendage at the pole opposite the
operculum.
Final hosts: Deer, cattle, sheep, goat, pig, horse
Intermediate hosts: A variety of freshwater snails, Fossaria spp,
Lymnaea spp, Stagnicola spp
Geographical distribution: Mainly occurs in North America, central,
eastern and southwestern Europe, South Africa and Mexico.
Pathogenesis: In deer and cattle, the flukes are frequently encapsulated in
migration results in low pathogenicity. In cattle and in pigs the flukes may
become entrapped in a thick-walled fibrous capsule and there is no
connection to the bile ducts and consequently it is rare to find fluke eggs
in faeces in these livestock. Sometimes flukes can also be found in
254
liver there is often no obvious clinical sign of infection.
Clinical signs: In deer and cattle the parasites can cause hepatic damage
    i s e  ai   
host reaction and clinical signs are minimal.
Diagnosis: This is based primarily on clinical signs, and history of contact
with grazing deer in known endemic areas. Cysts and the large flukes are
presence of fluke eggs is a useful aid to diagnosis.
Pathology: In cattle and pigs, thick-walled cysts with fibrous capsules or
calcified cysts may be present in the liver.
Epidemiology: The various snail intermediate hosts tend to occur in
stagnant semi-permanent water that contains large amounts of dead or
dying vegetation, swamp areas, or pools and streams. F. magna is
indigenous to North America and is common in Canada and the Great
Lake areas where the white-tailed deer and the elk are commonly infected.
Domestic cattle and sheep become infected when they graze pasture where
parasitised deer occur.
Treatment: For cattle and sheep the commonly used flukicides, such as
triclabendazole, closantel, clorsulon and albendazole, are effective.
Mature F. magna are susceptible to oxyclosanide.
deer. Elimination of the snail intermediate hosts is difficult due to their
varied habitats. Similarly, removal of Cervidae may not be practical.
Because of these factors sheep rearing, particularly, is difficult in areas
where the parasite is prevalent.
Notes: F. magna is primarily a parasite of deer (Cervidae) and is
commonly found in white-tailed deer, elk and moose. For more details see
Chapter 8: Ungulates (Deer).

Subspecies: granulosus
Common Name: Dwarf dog tapeworm, hydatidosis
Predilection site: Mainly liver and lungs (intermediate hosts); small
intestine (definitive hosts)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: Hydatid cysts are large fluid-filled vesicles, 5-10 cm
in diameter, with a thick concentrically laminated cuticle and an internal
germinal layer.
Description, microscopic: The germinal layer produces numerous small
vesicles or brood capsules each containing up to 40 scolices, invaginated
into their neck portions and attached to the wall by stalks. Brood capsules
may become detached from the wall of the vesicle and float freely in the
vesicular fluid and form ^hydatid sand'

PARASITES OF THE PANCREAS
Eurytrema coelomaticum
Common name: Pancreatic fluke
Predilection site: Pancreatic ducts, rarely the bile ducts
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Dicrocoelidae
Deseription, gross: A leaf-shaped reddish brown fluke. Adults measure
around 8-12 mm x 6-7 mm.
Description, microscopic: The body is thick and the juvenile flukes are
armed with spines. The oral sucker is large, the pharynx and oesophagus
short. Eggs measure around 40-50 × 25-35 μm and are similar to those of
Dicrocoefium.
Final hosts: Cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, pigs, camels and man
Intermediate hosts: Two are required:
1. Land snails, particularly of the genus Bradybaena
2. Grasshoppers of the genus Conocephalus or tree crickets
(Oecanthus)
 a s e a  a s  ss g  a
generations of sporocysts occur. Cercariae are released onto the herbage
about 5 months after initial infection and these are ingested by
grasshoppers. Infective metacercariae are produced in about 3 weeks. The
final host becomes infected by accidentally eating the second intermediate
host. Metacercariae encyst in the duodenum and migrate to the pancreas
via the pancreatic duct and reside in the small ducts of the pancreas. The
prepatent period in cattle is 3-4 months.
Geographical distribution: South America, Asia and Europe
258
Pathogenesis: Low to moderate infections produce little effect on the
host. Heavy infections may cause a sporadic wasting syndrome and
emaciation.
Clinical signs: No specific signs but a general weight loss may occur in
heavy infections.
Diagnosis: Usually reported as an incidental finding at necropsy
Pathology: Large numbers of flukes can cause dilation and thickening of
the pancreatic ducts and extensive fibrosis. Flukes may also be embedded
in the pancreatic parenchyma causing chronic interstitial pancreatitis and
there is sometimes a granulomatous reaction around fluke eggs that have
penetrated the walls of the ducts.
Epidemiology: Infection is influenced by the availability of the
invertebrate intermediate hosts. Prevalence rates of E. coelomaticum can
be as high as 70% in slaughtered cattle in endemic areas.
Treatment: There is no specific treatment for eurytrematosis.
Control: This is not feasible where the intermediate hosts are endemic
Eurytremapancreaticum
Common name: Pancreatic fluke
Predilection site: Pancreatic ducts and occasionally the bile ducts and the
duodenum.
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Dicrocoeliidae
Description: Similar to E. coelomaticum. Adults measure around 8-16 x
5-8 mm.
Geographical distribution: Eastern Asia and South America

PARASITES OF THE
CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Schistosoma bovis
Common name: Blood fluke, bilharziosis
Predilection site: Portal and mesenteric veins, urogenital veins
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Schistosomatidae
Description, gross: The sexes are separate; the males are 9-22 mm long
and 1-2 mm wide, and the female 12-28 mm long. The suckers and the
body of the male behind the suckers are armed with minute spines, while
the dorsal surface of the male bears small cuticular tubercles. The slender
the male.
Deseription, microscopic: The eggs are usually spindle-shaped, but
smaller ones may be oval and measure 187 x 60 μm. There is no
operculum.
Final hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, camel
Intermediate hosts: Snails (Bulinus contortus, B. truncates, Physopsis
africana,P.nasuta)
Life cycle: The ovigerous female penetrates deeply into the small vessels
of the mucosa or submucosa of the intestine and inserts her tail into a
small venule and since the genital pore is terminal, the eggs are deposited,
or even pushed, into the venule. There, aided by their spines and by
proteolytic enzymes secreted by the unhatched miracidia, they penetrate
the endothelium to enter the intestinal submucosa and ultimately the gut
lumen; they are then passed out in the faeces. Worms present in the
vesical veins penetrate the endothelial lining of the bladder where eggs
may be passed in the urine. Some eggs are carried away in the
bloodstream and locate in other organs such as the liver. The eggs hatch in
261
water and the miracidia penetrate appropriate snails. Cercariae develop
from daughter sporocysts, which replace the redia stage and there is no

ingestion the cercariae lose their forked tails, transform to schistosomula,
Or young flukes, and travel via the bloodstream through the heart and
        
mesenteric veins. The prepatent period is 6-7 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Africa, Middle East, southern Asia, southern
Europe
Pathogenesis: The young flukes cause some damage during migration but
eggs in the intestine and the blood-sucking habit of the worms. Acute
disease is characterised by diarrhoea and anorexia due to response to the
deposition of eggs in the mesenteric veins and their subsequent infiltration
in the intestinal mucosa. The presence of the worms in veins of the
bladder in cattle may cause damage to the bladder wall and haematuria.
Clinical signs: These are diarrhoea, sometimes blood stained and
containing mucus, anorexia, thirst, anaemia and emaciation. In cattle, the
presence of the worms in the vesical veins may cause haematuria.
Diagnosis: This is based mainly on the clinicopathological picture of
diarrhoea, wasting and anaemia, coupled with a history of access to
natural water sources. The relatively persistent diarrhoea, often blood
stained and containing mucus, may help to differentiate this syndrome
fromfasciolosis.

stages of infection.
In general, when schistosomosis is suspected, diagnosis is best confirmed
by a detailed postmortem examination which will reveal the lesions and, if
the mesentery is stretched, the presence of numerous schistosomes in the
262
Pathology: At necropsy during the acute phase of the disease there are
marked haemorrhagic lesions in the mucosa of the intestine, but as the
disease progresses the wall of the intestine appears greyish, thickened and
oedematous due to confluence of the egg granulomata and the associated
inflammatory changes. The liver may be larger than normal, depending on
the stage of the disease, and may be markedly cirrhotic in long-standing
infections. On microscopic examination there is pigmentation of the liver
and numerous eggs may be found, surrounded by cellular infiltration and
fibrous tissue. The spleen may be slightly swollen and lymph glands are
usually pigmented.
Epidemiology: The epidemiology is totally dependent upon water as a
medium for infection of both the intermediate and final host. Small
main snail habitats. Eggs, miracidia and cercariae are short-lived with
seasonal transmission directly related to rainfall and temperature. The fact
that percutaneous infection may occur encourages infection where
livestock are obliged to wade in water. In cattle, high prevalence is usually
associated with low numbers of worms, although worm burdens increase
with age whilst egg excretion declines markedly in animals above 2 years
of age due to the development of partial immunity.
Treatment: For economic reasons, chemotherapy is not suitable for the
control of schistosomiosis in domestic stock except during severe clinical
outbreaks. Care has to be exercised in treating clinical cases of
schistosomosis since the dislodgement of the damaged flukes may result
in emboli being formed and subsequent occlusion of major mesenteric and
portal blood vessels with fatal consequences. Older drugs still used in
some areas are the antimonial preparations, tartar emetic, antimosan and
Over a period of days at high dosage rates. Fatalities associated with the
use of these drugs are not uncommon. Praziquantel, which is the drug of
choice for treatment of human schistosomosis,is also effective in
Control: This is similar to that outlined for F. gigantica and
Paramphistomum infections. Since the prevalence of snail populations
varies according to temperature, local efforts should be made to identify
the months of maximum snail population, and cattle movements planned
to avoid their exposure to dangerous stretches of water at these times.
263
When watering of stock is from a reservoir or stream, fencing the water
source and leading a pipe to troughs can achieve control. To do this
effectively from streams, the water may require to be pumped and in
troughs be cleaned out regularly since they can become colonised by
snails.
When grazing depends on the dry season use of marshy areas around
receding lakebeds, snail control is difficult. Molluscicides are usually
impractical because of the large body of water involved and their possible
effect on fish, which may form an important part of the local food supply.
Apart from repeated anthelmintic treatment to prevent patency of acquired
infections of Schistosoma, there is often little one can do. Ideally, such
areas are often best suited to irrigation and the growing of cash crops, the
supply to cattle.
Schistosomajaponicum
Common name: Blood fluke, bilharziosis
Predilection site: Portal and mesenteric veins
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Schistosomatidae
Description, gross: The sexes are separate; the male, which is broad and
flat, is 9.5-20 mm long, carrying the female which is 12-26 mm long, in
the hollow of its inwardly curved body (Fig. 2.26). The suckers lie close
together near the anterior end. The cuticle is spiny on the suckers and in
the gynaecophoric canal. This characteristic and the vascular predilection
site are sufficient for generic identification.
Description, microscopic: The eggs are short, oval, 70-100 μm long, and
may have a small sub-terminal spine. There is no operculum.
Final hosts: Cattle, horse, sheep, goat, dog, cat, rabbit, pig, man
Intermediate hosts: Snails belonging to the genus Oncomeiania.
264
Life cycle: This is similar to S. bovis. Development to the cercarial stage
occurs through two generations of sporocyst without a redial form and
there is no metacercarial phase, penetration of the final host by the motile
cercariae occurring via the skin. The developmental period in the snail can
be as short as 5 weeks. Schistosomula, or young flukes, that reach the
abdominal vessels and pass to the portal veins become sexually mature in
about4weeks.
Fig. 2.26 Male and female Schistosoma in copula
Geographical distribution: South and east Asia
Pathogenesis: The penetration of the cercariae through the skin causes
dermatitis, which is evident about 24 hours after infection. Passage
through the lungs may cause pneumonia in gross infections and abdominal
organs such as the liver may become congested during the early stages of
the disease due to the arrival of immature worms in the intra-hepatic portal
blood vessels. The most serious damage is caused by the adult parasites in
the egg-laying stage due to the irritation caused by the eggs lodged in the
tissues, which are forced to find their way through small venules to the
epithelium and lumen of the gut. The masses of eggs become surrounded
by inflamed areas and an infiltration of leucocytes, particularly
eosinophils, gives rise to a rather characteristic type of abcess. The
abcesses in the intestinal wall usually burst, discharging their contents into
the lumen of the gut and eventually heal forming scar tissue. In the liver
the abcesses become encapsulated and eventually become calcified, a
265
large number of such foci leading to liver enlargement, cirrhosis and
ascites.
Acute disease, characterised by diarrhoea and anorexia, occurs 7-8 weeks
          
granulomatous response to the deposition of eggs in the mesenteric veins
and their subsequent infiltration in the intestinal mucosa. Following
massive infection death can occur rapidly, but more usually the clinical
signs abate slowly as the infection progresses. As this occurs, there
appears to be a partial shift of worms away from the intestinal mucosa and
reactions to these migrating parasites and their eggs can occur in the liver.
Schistosomosis is generally considered to be a much more serious and
important infection in sheep than in larger ruminants, and even where a
high prevalence of the parasite is detected in slaughtered cattle, clinical
signs of the disease are seen only rarely. In sheep, anaemia and
hypoalbuminaemia have been shown to be prominent during the clinical
phase apparently as a result of mucosal haemorrhage, dyshaemopoeisis
and an expansion in plasma volume. The significance of low-level

considerableeffectonproductivity.
There is evidence, experimentally, of acquired resistance to reinfection by
homologous species and, from natural infections, that resistance may
develop as a result of prior exposure to a heterologous species.
Pathology: This is similar to S. bovis. Scar tissue and frequent
papillomatous growths may be seen on the intestinal mucosa. On sections
of the liver there is also evidence of egg granulomata and of portal fibrosis
provoked by eggs, which have, inadvertently, been swept into small portal
vessels. The mesentery, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen are frequently
altered due to the presence of abnormal amounts of connective tissue.
Details of the clinical signs, diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment and
control are as for S. bovis.
Schistosoma nasalis
Synonym: Schistosoma nasaiae
Common name: Snoring disease
266
Predilection site: Veins of nasal mucosa
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Schistosomatidae
Description, gross: The sexes are separate, the male, which is broad and
flat and about 1 cm long, carrying the female in the hollow of its inwardly
curved body.
Description, microscopic: The eggs are 336-581 μm long, boomerang
shaped, with a terminal spine.
Final hosts: Cattle, goat, sheep, buffalo, horse
Intermediate   hosts:
Snails(Lymnaea
1luteola,L.acuminata,
Indopianorbis exustus)
Life cycle: Details of the life cycle are not completely known. The female
in the veins of the nasal mucosa lays her eggs, which presumably enter the
nasal sinuses and are sneezed out. The eggs hatch in minutes in water and
the miracidia penetrate appropriate snails. Development to the cercarial
stage occurs without a redial form and there is no metacercarial phase.
After penetration or ingestion the cercariae transform to schistosomula, 0r
young flukes, and travel to their final site, the nasal veins.
Geographical distribution: India, Pakistan, SE Asia
Pathogenesis: In heavy infections there is a copious mucopurulent
discharge, snoring and dyspnoea. The main pathogenic effects are
associated with the eggs, which cause abscess formation in the mucosa.
Fibrous granulomatous growths occur which may occlude the nasal
passages.
Clinical signs: Coryza, sneezing, dyspnoea and snoring
Diagnosis: Infection is confirmed by the presence of the spindle-shaped
eggs in the nasal discharge.
Pathology: The mucosa of the nasal sinuses is studded with small
abcesses that contain the eggs of the worms, and later show much fibrous
tissue and proliferating epithelium.
267
Epidemiology: The epidemiology is totally dependent upon water as a
medium for infection of both the intermediate and final host.
Treatment and control: As for S. bovis
the life cycle, pathogenesis, epidemiology, treatment and control are

Description, gross: The sexes are separate; the males are 5-19 mm long,
and the females 6-22 mm long.
Description, microscopic: The eggs are oval with a terminal spine and
measure 57-140 × 18-72 μm.
Final hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, horse, donkey, camel
Intermediate hosts: Snails (Indopianorbis)
Geographical distribution: India
Schistosoma spindale
Predilection site: Mesenteric veins
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Schistosomatidae
Description, gross: The sexes are separate, the male, which is broad and
flat and about 2.0 cm long, carrying the female in the hollow of its
inwardly curved body.
Description, microscopic: The eggs are 100-500 μm long, spindle
shaped and have a lateral or terminal spine. There is no operculum
Hosts: Cattle, horse, pig and occasionally dog
Geographical distribution: Parts of Asia and the Far East
Schistosomaturkestanica
Synonym: Orientobilharzia turkstanicum

liver
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Schistosomatidae
Description, gross: Small species, the male is 4.2-8 mm and the female
3.48 mm.
269
Description, microscopic: The female uterus contains only one egg at a
time, which measures 72-77 × 16-26 μm with a terminal spine and short
appendage at the other end.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, camel, horse, donkey, buffalo
Geographical distribution: Asia
Pathogenesis: Of little significance in cattle but can cause marked debility
in sheep and goats, causing liver cirrhosis and nodules in the intestines.
Elaeophora poeli
Common name: Large aortic filariosis
Predilection site: Blood vessels
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: Slender worms, males measuring around 4-7 cm and
females up to 30 cm.
Description, microscopic: There are no lips and the oesophagus is very
long. The tail of the male bears five to seven pairs of papillae, two pairs
being pre-cloacal. Microfilariae are 340-360 μm.
Final hosts: Cattle, buffalo, zebu
Intermediate hosts: Not known, possibly Tabanid flies
Life cycle: Indirect life cycle. The microfilariae are ingested by the
intermediate host and the L3, when developed, are released into the wound
made when the insect next feeds. The male occurs in nodules in the wall
of the aorta, while the female is fixed in nodules by its anterior extremity
with the rest of the body free in the lumen of the aorta. Microfilariae occur
in the blood and in subcutaneous connective tissue.
Geographical distribution: Parts of Africa,Asia and the Far East
Pathogenesis: In cattle, nodules, from which the female worms protrude.

Pathology: The main affected area is the thoracic region of the aorta. In
light infections, the lesions are found chiefly on the dorsal wall of the
aorta, near the openings of the intercostal arteries. In heavy infections, the
Epidemiology: Because of the innocuous nature of the infection in cattle,
the distribution of the species in these hosts is not completely known.
Treatment: Treatment is not indicated.
Onchocerca armillata
Common name: Aortic filariosis
Predilection site: Aorta
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: Slender whitish worms. Male worms are about 7 cm
and female worms up to 70 cm long.
Description, microscopic: Microfilariae are unsheathed and measure
346-382 μm.
Final hosts: Cattle, rarely camel, sheep, goat
Intermediate hosts: Midges (Culicoides), blackflies (Simulium)
Life cycle: The life cycle of Onchocerca armillata is typically filarioid
The microfilariae are found transiently in the bloodstream and more
usually in the skin of the dorsal parts of the body. Biting insects, feeding
in this area, ingest microfilariae, which then develop to the infective stage
271
in around 3 weeks. When these infected insects feed on another bovine
host, transmission of L3 occurs.
Geographical distribution: Africa, Middle East, India
strategically important site in the bovine aorta, is not usually associated
with clinical signs. It is usually only discovered at the abattoir, surveys in
the Middle East having shown a prevalence as high as 90%.
Clinical signs: Infection is usually inapparent.
Diagnosis: Typical nodular lesions may be found in the wall of the aorta
on postmortem examination. Microfilariae may also be found in skin
biopsy samples taken from affected areas. The piece of skin is placed in
warm saline and teased to allow emergence of the microfilariae, and is
thenincubatedfor about 8-l2 hours. The microfilariae are readily
recognised by their sinuous movements in a centrifuged sample of the
saline. Another option is to scarify the skin of a predilection site and
examine the fluid exudate for microfilariae.
Pathology: O. armillata is found in grossly visible nodules in the intima.
media and adventitia of the aorta (Fig. 2.27), and atheromatous plaques
are commonly seen on the intima. In chronic infections, the aortic wall is
thickened and the intima shows tortuous tunnels with numerous nodules
containing yellow caseous fluid and coiled worms. Aortic aneurysms have
been noted in about a quarter of infections.
Fig. 2.27 Onchocerca armillata within the aorta.
272
Epidemiology: Prevalence is very high is some regions with 80-90% of
animals infected.
Treatment: Rarely indicated. Daily administration of diethylcarbamazine
over a period of 21 days acts as a microfilaricide, and a single dose of
ivermectin is highly efficient in this respect, although the dying
microfilariae may provoke local tissue reactions.
Control: With the ubiquity of the insect vectors there is little possibility
of efficient control, though the use of microfilaricides will reduce the
numbers of infected flies. In any case, with the relatively innocuous nature
of the infection there is unlikely to be any demand for control.
TRYPANOSOMIOSIS
Members  of  the  genus  Trypanosoma  are  haemoflagellates  of
overwhelming importance in cattle in sub-Saharan Africa as a cause of
273
trypanosomiosis. See Chapter 1 (Protozoa - Zoomastigophorasida) for
general descriptions.
Salivarian trypanosomes
A number of species of Trypanosoma, found in domestic and wild
Africa. The presence of trypanosomosis precludes the rearing of livestock
in many areas while in others, where the vectors are not so numerous,
trypanosomosis is often a serious problem, particularly in cattle. The
disease,  sometimes 
known  as  nagana,
is
characterisedby
lymphadenopathy and anaemia accompanied by progressive emaciation
and, often, death.
Pathogenesis
The signs and effects of the various trypanosomes found in domestic
animals are more or less similar The pathogenesis of trypanosomosis may
be considered under three headings:
1. Lymphoid enlargement and splenomegaly develop associated
with plasma cell hyperplasia and hypergammaglobulinaemia, which
 i a       a  
variable degree of suppression of immune responses to other
antigens such as microbial pathogens or vaccines. Ultimately, in
infections of long duration, the lymphoid organs and spleen become
shrunken due to exhaustion of their cellular elements.
2. Anaemia is a cardinal feature of the disease, particularly in
cattle, and initially is proportional to the degree of parasitaemia.
 sis     si m
erythrophagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocytic systems of the
spleen, liver and lungs, but as the disease becomes chronic there
may
y  be  decreased   haemoglobin  synthesis.  Leucopenia   and
thrombocytopenia are caused by mechanisms  that predispose
leucocytes   and    platelets  to   phagocytosis.  Immunological
mechanisms in the pathogenesis lead to extensive proliferation of
activated macrophages, which engulf or destroy erythrocytes,
leucocytes, platelets and haematopoietic cells. Later, in infections of
and intermittent, the anaemia may resolve to a variable degree
274
However, in some chronic cases it may persist despite
chemotherapy.
3. Cell degeneration and inflammatory infiltrates occur in many
organs, such as the skeletal muscle and the central nervous system,
but perhaps most significantly in the myocardium where there is
separation and degeneration of the muscle fibres. The mechanisms
underlying these changes are still under study.
Clinical signs
In cattle, the major signs are anaemia, generalised enlargement of the
superficial lymph glands, lethargy and progressive loss of bodily condition
(Fig. 2.28). Fever and loss of appetite occur intermittently during
parasitaemic peaks, the latter becoming marked in the terminal stages of
the disease. Typically, the disease is chronic, extending over several
months, and usually terminates fatally if untreated. As a herd
phenomenon, the growth of young animals is stunted, while adults show
decreased fertility, and if pregnant, may abort or give birth to weak
offspring. In the terminal stages, animals become extremely weak, the
lymph nodes are reduced in size and there is often a jugular pulse. Death
is associated with congestive heart failure due to anaemia and myocarditis.
Occasionally, the disease is acute, death occurring within 2-3 weeks of
infection preceded by fever, anaemia and widespread haemorrhages.

275
Diagnosis
The clinical signs of the disease, although indicative, are not
pathognomonic.  Confirmation  of clinical diagnosis depends  on  the
o sn      s 
  is  a   s s
parasitaemia is massive it is possible to detect motile trypanosomes in
fresh films of blood. More usually, both thick and thin smears of blood are
air-dried and examined later. Thick smears, de-haemoglobinised before
staining with Giemsa or Leishman's stain, offer a better chance of finding
trypanosomes, while the stained thin smears are used for differentiation of
the trypanosome species.
More sensitive techniques utilise centrifugation in a microhaematocrit
buffy coat and the plasma; alternatively, the tube may be snapped, the
buffy coat expressed on to a slide, and the contents examined under
dark-ground or phase-contrast microscopy for motile trypanosomes. With
these techniques the packed red cell volume is also obtained which is of
indirect value in diagnosis if one can eliminate other causes of anaemia,
especially helminthosis.
276
A number of serological tests have been described and include indirect
   e      
Pathology
The carcase is often pale, emaciated and there may be oedematous
atrophy of fat. The liver, lymph nodes and spleen are enlarged and the
viscera are congested. Petechiae may appear on lymph nodes, pericardium
and intestinal mucosa. The liver is hypertrophic and congested with
degeneration and necrosis of the hepatocytes, dilation of blood vessels and
parenchymal  infiltration  of  mononuclear   cells.  A  non-suppurative
myocarditis, sometimes associated with hydropericarditis, has been
reported accompanied by degeneration and necrosis of the myocardial
tissue. Other lesions can include glomerulonephritis, renal tubular
necrosis,   non-suppurative
meningio-encephalomyelitis,focal
poliomalacia, keratitis, opthalmitis, orchitis, interstitial pneumonia and
bone marrow atrophy. Splenic and lymph node hypertrophy occur during
the acute phase but the lymphoid tissues are usually exhausted and fibrotic
in the chronic stage.
Epidemiology
The vectors are various species of Glossina including G. morsitans, G.
paipalis, G. longipaipis, G. pallidipes and G. austeni. Typanosoma
congolense can also be transmitted mechanically by other biting flies in
tsetse-free areas, although this is uncommon. Since the life cycle of T.
vivax is short, it is more readily transmitted than other species and
mechanical transmission of T. vivax by tabanids allows it to spread outside
the tsetse belt. The disease can also be transmitted mechanically through
 contaminated needles and instruments.
The epidemiology depends on three factors: the distribution of the vectors,
virulence of the parasite and the response of the host.
· The vectors. Of the three groups of tsetse flies (see Glossina), the
savannah and riverine are the most important since they inhabit
areas suitable for grazing and watering. Although the infection rate
of Glossina with trypanosomes is usually low, ranging from 1-20%
277
of the flies, each is infected for life, and their presence in any
difficult. Biting flies may act as mechanical vectors, but their
significance in Africa is still undefined
 The parasites. Since parasitaemic animals commonly survive for
prolonged periods, there are 
 ample
opportunitiesforfly
transmission. Perhaps the most important aspect of trypanosomosis
which accounts for the persistent parasitaemia is the way in which
        sa s 
glycoprotein coat which is antigenic and provokes the formation of
antibodies which cause opsonisation and lysis of the trypanosomes.
Unfortunately, by the time the antibody is produced, a proportion of
the trypanosomes have altered the chemical composition of their
glycoprotein coat and now, displaying a different antigenic surface.
are unaffected by the antibody. Those trypanosomes possessing this
parasitaemia; the host produces a second antibody, but again the
glycoprotein coat has altered in a number of trypanosomes so that a
third wave of parasitaemia occurs. This process of antigenic
variation associated with waves and remissions of parasitaemias,
often at weekly intervals, may continue for months, usually with a
fatal outcome. The repeated switching of the glycoprotein coat is
now known to depend on a loosely ordered sequential expression of
an undefined number of genes, each coding for a different
glycoprotein coat. This, together with the finding that metacyclic
a different genetic repertoire, explains why domestic animals, even
if treated successfully, are often immediately susceptible to
reinfection. The complexity of antigens potentially involved has
also defeated attempts at vaccination.
The hosts. Trypanosomosis is basically an infection of wildlife in

trypanotolerance. In contrast, rearing of domestic livestock in
or selection has occurred in several breeds. Thus in West Africa
278
small humpless cattle of the Bos taurus type, notably the N'Dama,
survive and breed in areas of heavy trypanosome challenge despite
the absence of control measures
(Fig.2.29). However, their
resistance is not absolute and trypanosomosis exacts a heavy toll,
particularly in productivity. In other areas of Africa, indigenous
breeds of sheep and goats are known to be trypanotolerant,
with antigenic variation is unknown. It is thought that the control
and gradual elimination of their parasitaemias may depend on the
possession of a particularly rapid and effective antibody response,
although other factors may also be involved.

Subgenus: Trypanozoon
Common name: Nagana
Predilection site: Blood. T. brucei brucei is also found extravascularly in.
for example, the myocardium, central nervous system (CNS) and
reproductive tract.
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
279
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: T. brucei brucei is pleomorphic in form and ranges from
long and slender, up to 42 μm (average 29 μm), to short and stumpy,
12-26 μm (mean 18 μm), the two forms often being present in the same
blood sample. The undulating membrane is conspicuous, the kinetoplast is
small and sub-terminal and the posterior end is pointed. In the slender
form the kinetoplast is up to 4 μm from the posterior end, which is usually
drawn out, tapering almost to a point, and has a well developed free
flagellum; in the stumpy form the flagellum is either short or absent and
the posterior end is broad and rounded with the kinetoplast almost
terminal. Intermediate forms average 23 μm long and have a blunt
posterior end and moderately long flagellum (Fig. 2.30). A fourth form
with a posterior nucleus may be seen in laboratory animals. In fresh
unfixed blood films, the organism moves rapidly within small areas of the
microscope field.

Life cycle: Tsetse flies ingest trypanosomes in the blood or lymph while

glycoprotein surface coat, and become elongated and multiply in the
trypomastigote, form and acquire an epimastigote form, characterised by
the fact that the kinetoplast lies just in front of the nucleus. After further
multiplication of the epimastigotes they transform again into small,
typically trypomastigote forms with a glycoprotein surface coat. These are
the infective forms for the next host and are called metacyclic
metacyclic trypanosomes are inoculated into the new host when the tsetse
fly feeds.
At the site of inoculation the metacyclic forms multiply locally as the
typical blood forms, producing within a few days a raised cutaneous
bloodstream and multiply; a parasitaemia, detectable in the peripheral
blood, usually becomes apparent 1-3 weeks later. Subsequently, the
parasitaemia may persist for many months although its level may wax and
wane due to the immune response of the host.
Geographical distribution: Approximately 10 million square kilometres
of sub-Saharan Africa between latitudes 14°N and 29°S.
Pathogenesis: In T. brucei brucei infections, the disease is usually more
chronic in cattle and animals may survive for several months and may
recover.
Treatment: The two drugs in common use are isometamidium and
diaminazine aceturate.These are usually successfulexcept where
trypanosomes have developed resistance to the drug or in some very
chronic cases. Treatment should be followed by surveillance since
reinfection, followed by clinical signs and parasitaemia, may occur within
a week or two. Alternatively, the animal may relapse after chemotherapy,
due to a persisting focus of infection in its tissues or because the
trypanosomes are drug resistant.

Family: Trypanosomatidae
Hosts: Horse, donkey, camel, cattle, zebu, goat, pig, dog, water buffalo,
elephant, capybara, tapir, mongoose, ocelot, deer and other wild animals.
Geographical distribution: North Africa, Central and South America,
central and southern Russia, parts of Asia (India, Burma, Malaysia,
southern China, Indonesia, Phillipines)
Pathogenesis: Domestic species such as cattle, buffalo and pigs are
commonly infected, but overt disease is uncommon and their main
significance is as reservoirs of infection.
Treatment and control: Suramin or quinapyramine (Trypacide) are the
drugs of choice for treatment and also confer a short period of
prophylaxis. For more prolonged protection a modified quinapyramine
known as *Trypacide Pro-Salt' is also available. Unfortunately, drug
resistance, at least to suramin, is not uncommon.

Notes: The original distribution of this parasite coincided with that of the
camel, and is often associated with arid desserts and semiarid steppes.

Trypanosoma congolense
Subgenus: Nannomonas
Common name: Nagana, paranagana, Gambia fever, ghindi, gobial
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: T. congofense is small, monomorphic in form, 8-20 μm
long. The undulating membrane is inconspicuous, the medium-sized
kinetoplast is marginal and the posterior end is blunt. There is no free
flagellum (Figs 2.31, 2.32). In fresh blood films the 0rganism moves
sluggishly, often apparently attached to red cells.

then the metacyclic, infective trypanosomes that pass to the hypopharynx
and infect new hosts when the tsetse flies bite and feed.
Geographical distribution: Africa, Central, West Indies, Central and
South America (Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Columbia, Guyana, French

This currently depends on the control of tsetse flies, discussed under
Tsetse flies (Glossina), and on the use of drugs (Table 2.2).

Notes: Often referred to as a *non-pathogenic trypanosome'
BABESIOSIS
Life cycle
Multiplication of Babesia organisms in the vertebrate host occurs in the
erythrocytes by binary fission, endodyogeny, endopolyogeny (budding) or
merogony to form merozoites. These are liberated from the erythrocyte
and invade other cells. The asexual cycle continues indefinitely and the
animals may remain infected for life. On ingestion by a tick these forms
become vermiform, and enter the body cavity then the ovary and penetrate
the eggs where they round up and divide to form small round organisms.
When the larval tick moults into the nymph stage, the parasites enter the
salivary gland and undergo a series of binary fissions entering the cells of
the salivary gland acini. They multiply further until the host cells are filled
with thousands of minute parasites. These become vermiform, break out
of the host cell and lie in the lumen of the gland and are injected into the
mammalian host when the tick sucks blood.
Epidemiology
The epidemiology of the bovine Babesia species depends on the interplay
of a number of factors and these include:
1. The virulence of the particular species of Babesia. B. bigemina
and B. bovis in tropical and subtropical regions are highly
pathogenic, B. divergens in northern Europe is relatively
291
pathogenic, whilst B. major produces only mild and transient
anaemia.
2. The age of the host. It is frequently stated that there is an inverse
age resistance to Babesia infection in that young animals are less
susceptible to babesiosis than older animals. The reason for this is
not known.
3. The immune status of the host. In endemic areas, the young
animal first acquires immunity passively, in the colostrum of the
dam and, as a result, often suffers only transient infections with
mild clinical signs. However, these infections are apparently
sufficient to stimulate active immunity, although recovery is
followed by a long period during which they are carriers when,
although showing no clinical signs, their blood remains infective to
ticks for many months. It used to be thought that this active

the phenomenon was termed premunity. However, it seems unlikely

lose their infection either naturally or by chemotherapy, but still
retain a solid immunity.
4. The level of tick challenge. In endemic areas, where there are
many infected ticks, the immunity of the host is maintained at a
contrast, where there are few ticks or when they are confined to
young animals receive little, if any, colostral protection. If, in these
circumstances, the numbers of ticks suddenly increase due to
favourable climatic conditions or to a reduction in dipping
frequency, the incidence of clinical cases may rise sharply. This
situation is known as enzootic instability.
5. Stress. In endemic areas, the occasional outbreak of clinical
disease, particularly in adult animals, is often associated with some
form of stress, such as parturition or the presence of another
disease, such as tick-borne fever.

Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
characteristically is seen and identified by the pear-shaped bodies joined at
an acute angle within the mature erythrocyte. Round forms measure 2 μm
and the pear-shaped, elongated ones are 45 μm. The erythrocytic stages
lack a conoid, micropores and typical mitochondria, but have an anterior
and posterior polar ring and typically two rhoptries.
Hosts: Cattle, buffalo
Geographical distribution: Australia, Africa, North, Central and South
America, Asia and southern Europe
destruction of the erythrocytes with accompanying haemoglobinaemia,
haemoglobinuria and fever.
Generally, B. bigemina infections are not as virulent as those of B. bovis.
   g t n  s n nn   
Otherwise the disease is typically biphasic, the acute haemolytic crisis, if
not fatal, being followed by a prolonged period of recovery.
Clinical signs: Calves are relatively resistant to infection, and do not
usually show clinical disease. In older animals, clinical signs can be very
severe; however, differences in pathogenicity may occur with various B.
bigemina isolates associated with different geographical areas. The first
sign is usually a high fever with rectal temperatures reaching 41.5°C
(106.7°F). There is anorexia and ruminal atony. Often the first visible

becomes uneasy, seeks shade and may lie down. Cattle may stand with an
arched back, have a roughened hair coat and show evidence of dyspnoea
and tachycardia. The mucous membranes are first inflamed and reddened,
but as erythrocytic lysis occurs, they become palid and show signs of
anaemia. Anaemia is a contributory factor to the weakness and loss of
condition seen in cattle that survive the acute phase of the disease. The
anaemia may occur very rapidly, with 75% or more of the erythrocytes
being destroyed in just a few days. This is usually associated with severe
haemoglobinemia and haemoglobinuria. After onset of fever, the crisis
will usually pass within a week, and if the animal survives, there is usually
293
severe weight loss, drop in milk production, possible abortion and a
protracted recovery. Mortality is extremely variable and may reach 50%
or higher, but in the absence of undue stress most animals will survive.
Diagnosis: As for B. bovis
Pathology: Acute infections as for B. bovis. In cattle that have suffered a
more prolonged illness, acute lesions are much less conspicuous.
usually emaciated and icteric, the blood is thin and watery, the
intermuscular fascia is oedematous, the liver yellowish brown, and the bile
may contain flakes of semi-solid material. The kidneys are pale and often
oedematous, and the bladder may contain normal urine, depending on how
long past the haemolytic crisis the necropsy is performed. Although the
Epidemiology: Boophiius annufatus,B. micropfus and B. decoforatus are
the principal vectors of Babesia bigemina. Mechanical transmission is
possible, but it is not efficient enough to maintain infection in the absence
of specific tick vectors.
Treatment: As with B. bovis, successful treatment of B. bigemina
depends on early diagnosis and the prompt administration of effective
drugs. If medication is administered early, success is the rule, for there are
several effective compounds. One of the first successful treatments was
trypan blue. This treatment may be used to determine the type of infection
bovis is not. Generally, the small babesias are more resistant to
chemotherapy. The most commonly used compounds for treatment are
diminazene diaceturate (3-5 mg/kg), imidocarb (1-3 mg/kg) and
amicarbalide (5-10 mg/kg); however, the quinuronium and acridine
derivatives are also effective where these are available. Treatment of B.
bigemina is so effective in some instances that radical cures occur that will
eventually leave the animal susceptible to reinfection. For this reason,
reduced drug levels are sometimes indicated. Imidocarb has been
successfully used as a chemoprophylactic that will prevent clinical
infection for as long as 2 months, but allow mild sub-clinical infection to
occur as the drug level wanes resulting in premunition and immunity.
Control: Specific control measures are not usually necessary for animals
born of mothers in endemic areas, since their colostrum-acquired
294
immunity is gradually reinforced by repeated exposure to infection.
[ndeed, the veterinary importance of babesiosis is chiefly that it acts as a
constraint to the introduction of improved livestock from other areas.
Areas of enzootic instability also create problems when tick numbers
suddenly increase or animals, for some reason, are forced to use an
adjacent tick-infested area.
[mmunisation, using blood from carrier animals, has been practised for
many years in tropical areas, and more recently in Australia; rapidly
passaged strains of Babesia, which are relatively non-pathogenic, have
been widely utilised in live vaccines. In the near future, these may be
superseded by adjuvanted vaccines prepared from several recombinant
Babesia antigens. Otherwise the control of babesiosis in susceptible
animals introduced into endemic areas depends on surveillance for the
first few months after their arrival and, if necessary, treatment.
Vaccination of cattle against B. bigemina infection is commonly practised
in many countries by inoculating blood from donor animals. This is
usually obtained from a recently recovered case, any untoward reactions
in the 'vaccinates' being controlled by babesicidal drugs. In Australia, the
procedure is more sophisticated in that the vaccine is produced from acute
infections produced in splenectomised donors. For economy, the blood is
collected by exchange transfusion rather than by exsanguination. It is
interesting that the rapid passage of the parasite by blood inoculation in
splenectomised calves has fortuitously had the very desirable effect of
decreasing the virulence of the infection in non-splenectomised calves to
the extent that post vaccination surveillance of cattle is frequently not
performed. The parasite count of the blood determines the dilution of the
latter, which is dispensed in plastic bags, packed in ice and despatched in
insulated containers. Each dose of vaccine contains about 1o million
parasites. Most of the vaccine is used in cattle under 12 months of age
living in conditions of enzootic instability. The degree of protection
induced is such that only 1% of vaccinated cattle subsequently develop
cattle.
The primary disadvantage of red cell vaccines is their lability and the fact
that, unless their preparation is carefully supervised, they may spread
diseases such as enzootic bovine leucosis. Obviously there will be no such
problem with a vaccine based on recombinant antigens.
295
A regimen of four injections of long-acting oxytetracycline at weekly
on tick-infested pastures, has been shown to confer prophylaxis against B.
bigemina during this period, after which the cattle were immune to
subsequent challenge.
Notes: B. bigemina, a large Babesia is of particular interest historically,
since it was the first protozoan infection of man or animals demonstrated
to have an arthropod intermediate host; this was shown in 1893 by Smith
,   go s n    s

country.

Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
as a single body, as small round bodies, or as paired, pear-shaped bodies
joined at an obtuse angle within the centre of the mature erythrocyte. The
round forms measure 1-1.5 μm, and the pear-shaped bodies 1.5 × 2.4 μm
in size. Vacuolated signet ring forms are especially common.
Hosts: Cattle, buffalo, deer
Geographical distribution: Australia, Africa, Central and South
America, Asia and southern Europe
Pathogenesis: B. bovis is generally regarded as the most pathogenic of the
bovine Babesia. Although the classical signs of fever, anaemia and
haemoglobinuria occur, the degree of anaemia is disproportional to the
parasitaemia since haematocrit levels below 20% may be associated with
infections of less than 1% of the red cells. The reason for this is unknown.
In addition, B. bovis infection is associated with sludging of the red cells
in the small capillaries. In the cerebrum this causes blockage of the vessels

depression are invariably fatal. Finally, recent work has indicated that
some of the severity of B. bovis infection may be associated with the
activation of certain plasma components, leading to circulatory stasis,
shock and intravascular coagulation.
Clinical signs: [ncoordination, convulsions, depression, death
hemoglobinuria in cattle located in enzootic areas where Boophiius ticks
occur are usually sufficient to justify a diagnosis of babesiosis. For
confirmation, the examination of blood films, stained with Giemsa, will
reveal the parasites in the red cells. However, once the acute febrile phase
has subsided they are often impossible to find since they are rapidly
removed from the circulation. In addition, a technique of brain biopsies
has been described that has proven very useful in detecting and diagnosing
Babesia bovis infections. The characteristic low parasitemias in the
circulating blood make this technique very useful in improving the
chances of seeing the organism. There is a marked concentration of
infected erythrocytes in the capillaries of the brain.
methanol and/or a sample of whole blood in an anticoagulant and serum
should be collected. In cases of chronic infection, diagnosis is usually
made using a variety of serological tests for the detection of specific
antibodies, since the organism disappears or is present in extremely low
numbers soon after the acute infection. Presently, immunofluorescence
assay is the test of choice in the serologic diagnosis of B. bovis.
Other conditions that should be considered and may resemble babesiosis
are anaplasmosis, trypanosomiosis, theileriosis, leptospirosis, bacillary
haemoglobinuria, haemobartonellosis and eperythrozoonosis.
Pathology: At necropsy, the carcase is pale and jaundiced and the lungs
may be oedematous and congested in cattle that have died early in the
enlarged and icteric, and the gallbladder, which may have haemorrhage on
the mucous surface, is distended with thick, dark green bile. The spleen is
markedly enlarged, and has a dark pulpy consistency. The abomasal and
intestinal mucosa may be icteric with patches of sub-serosal haemorrhages
297
(Fig. 2.37). The blood is thin and watery. The urinary bladder is frequently
distended, with dark, reddish brown urine. Jaundice is commonly
distributed in the connective tissue. The lymph nodes are oedematous and
often have petechiation.
Fig. 2.37 Postmortem findings, Babesia bovis.
Epidemiology: Babesia bovis is transmitted by the same ticks that
transmit B. bigemina (Boophilus annulatus, B. microplus). The tick
Boophiius decoloratus, which is widely distributed in Africa, does not
appear to transmit Babesia bovis even though it readily transmits Babesia
bigemina. There are reports from Europe of Babesia bovis, for which the
vector is thought to be Ixodes ricinus.
Treatment: Successful treatment depends on early diagnosis and the
prompt administration of effective drugs. There is less likelihood of
success if treatment is delayed until the animal has been weakened by
fever and anaemia. Chemotherapy is generally effective, although B. bovis
is usually somewhat more difficult to treat than other Babesia species, and
a second treatment, or slightly increased dose rates, may be desirable. The
most commonly used compounds for the treatment of babesiosis are
diminazene diaceturate (3-5 mg/kg), imidocarb (1-3 mg/kg) and
amicarbalide (5-10 mg/kg); however, the quinuronium and acridine
derivatives are also effective where these are available. Trypan blue is not
effective against B. bovis.
298
Control: The numbers of ticks and therefore the quantum of Babesia
infection may be reduced by regular spraying or dipping with acaricides.
[n addition, in cattle, the selection and breeding of cattle which acquire a
high degree of resistance to ticks is practised, particularly in Australia.
Widespread use of tick vaccines may also have a significant influence on
the incidence of infection in cattle (see control of Babesia bigemina).
Repeated passage of B. bovis in splenectomised calves results in the
attenuation of the organism and for many years this attenuated vaccine has
been produced and successfully used in Australia for the prevention of B.
bovis. In some cattle (older, and producing dairy cows), chemotherapy
 im p aq  aa a a  i aq 
The development of in vitro techniques for the cultivation of B. bovis on
bovine erythrocytes has led to the isolation of soluble antigens, which,
when combined with adjuvants, have proven immunogenic. These
non-infectious vaccines, although they do not prevent infection, appear to
be responsible for moderating the effects of infection. They do not
produce as high a level of protection as is seen with premunising vaccines
but are safe and do not yield carriers. In some instances, these vaccines,
although protective against homologous challenge, may not protect
against immunological variants. The continuous in vitro passage of B.
bovis has been shown to induce a level of attenuation similar to that seen
         
infection following a challenge with virulent B. bovis. The primary
disadvantage of red cell vaccines is their lability and the fact that, unless

Babesia divergens
Common name: Redwater fever
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
299
Description: Examination of stained blood films shows the organisms to
be within red cells, almost always singly or as pairs, often arranged at a
characteristic angle with their narrow ends opposed. Typically, they are
pyriform, but may be round, elongated or cigarshaped. B. divergens is a
'small Babesia’ and in blood films typically appears as paired, widely
divergent organisms, 1.5 × 0.4 μm, lying near the edge of the red cell (Fig.
2.38). Other forms may be present measuring 2 × 1 μm, some are circular
up to 2 μm in diameter and a few may be vacuolated.
Hosts: Cattle
Geographical distribution: Northern Europe
destruction of the erythrocytes with accompanying haemoglobinaemia,
haemoglobinuria and fever. This may be so acute as to cause death within
a few days, during which the packed red cell volume falls below 20%. The
parasitaemia, which is usually detectable once the clinical signs appear,
may involve between 0.2% and 45% of the red cells. Milder forms of the
disease, associated with relatively resistant hosts, are characterised by
Fig. 2.38 Diverse forms of Babesia divergens in bovine red cells.

300
Clinical signs: Typically the acute disease occurs 1-2 weeks after the tick
commences to feed and is characterised by fever and haemoglobinuria
('redwater'). The mucous membranes, at first congested, become
jaundiced, the respiratory and pulse rates are increased, the heart beat is
usually very audible, and in cattle ruminal movements cease and abortion
may occur. If untreated, death commonly occurs in this phase. Otherwise,
convalescence is prolonged, there is loss of weight and milk production
and diarrhoea followed by constipation is common. In animals previously
exposed to infection, clinical signs may be mild or even inapparent.
Diagnosis: The history and clinical signs are usually sufficient to justify a
diagnosis of babesiosis. For confirmation, the examination of blood films.
stained with Giemsa, will reveal the parasites in the red cells (Fig. 2.39).

Pathology: At necropsy, the carcase is pale and jaundiced, the bile is thick
and  granular  and  there  may  be  subepicardial  and  subendocardial
haemorrhages.
Epidemiology: B. divergens is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus, and is
widespread and pathogenic, with clinical cases occurring during the
periods of tick activity, primarily in the spring and autumn. Infection in
the tick is transovarially transmitted and the larvae, nymphs and adults of
the next generation are all able to transmit infection to cattle
Fig. 2.39 Intraerythrocytic stages of Babesia divergens.
301
Treatment: Amicarbilide, diminazene aceturate and imidocarb are the
most commonly used drugs. Recently, long-acting preparations of
oxytetracycline have been shown to have a prophylactic effect against B.
divergens infection. Imidocarb, due to its persistence in the tissues, has a
prophylactic effect for several weeks. During the convalescent phase of
the disease, blood transfusions may be valuable as are drugs designed to
stimulate food and water intake.
Control: Normally no effort is made to control this infection in endemic
areas, although cattle recently introduced require surveillance for some
months, since, on average, one in four will develop clinical disease and of
these one in six will die if untreated. However, in some parts of mainland
Europe, such as the Netherlands, where ticks are confined to rough
vegetation on the edges of pastures and on roadsides, it is often possible to
take evasive measures. [t is thought that the red and roe deer are not
important reservoir hosts since only mild infections have been
experimentally produced in splenectomised deer.
Notes: Since 1957,several cases of fatal babesiosis due to B.divergens
infection have occurred in man in Yugoslavia, Russia, Ireland and
Scotland. In each case, the individual had been splenectomised sometime
previously, or was currently undergoing immunosuppressive treatment.

exposure to infection. Tick numbers may be reduced by regular spraying

or dipping with acaricides. The control of infection in susceptible animals
introduced into endemic areas depends on surveillance for the first few
months after their arrival and, if necessary, treatment.
THEILERIOSIS
Diseases caused by several species of Theileria (theileriosis) are a serious
constraint to livestock production in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The
parasites, which are tick transmitted, undergo repeated merogonony in the
lymphocytes ultimately releasing small merozoites, which invade the red
cells to become piroplasms.
Theileria are widely distributed in cattle and sheep in Africa, Asia, Europe
and Australia, have a variety of tick vectors and are associated with
Although the speciation of many Theileria is still controversial, largely
because of their morphological similarity, there are two species of major
veterinary importance in cattle. Minor and mildly pathogenic species
infecting cattle include T. velifera and T. taurotragi in Africa, T. mutans
and the T. sergenti/orientalis/buffeli complex.

Description: Trophozoite forms in the erythrocyte are predominantly
rod-shaped (1.5-2.0 x 0.1-1.0 μm), but may also be round, oval and
comma-shaped (Fig- 2.4l). Koch bodies are in the lymphocytes and

Fig. 2.42 Macroschizonts of Theileria parva in a smear of a lymph node
Hosts: Cattle, African buffalo (Syncerus caffer)
Life cycle: Erythrocytic merozoites are ingested by the tick intermediate

macro- and microgamonts to produce zygotes. These develop and enter
305
become fission bodies. In adult ticks, the primary fision bodies divide into
fission bodies and produce sporozoites that are released into the saliva
Cattle are infected when the ticks suck blood. The sporozoites are
inoculated into cattle and quickly enter lymphocytes in an associated
lymph gland, usually the parotid. The parasitised lymphocyte transforms
to a lymphoblast, which divides rapidly as the macroschizont develops.
This division is apparently stimulated by the parasite, which itself divides
synchronously with the lymphoblast to produce two infected cells. The
rate of proliferation is such that a ten-fold increase of infected cells may
occur every 3 days. About 12 days after infection, a proportion of the
macroschizonts develop into microschizonts and within a day or so these
produce the micromerozoites that enter erythrocytes, which after a few
binary fissions produce the varied forms present in the red cells.
For completion of the life cycle, the piroplasms require to be ingested by
the larvae or nymphal stages of the three-host vector, R. appendiculatus.
In these, the sexual phase described above occurs in the tick gut followed
development occurs until the next stage of the tick starts to feed when the
sporoblasts produceinfective sporozoites from about day 4 onwards.
Since female ticks feed continuously for about 10 days and males
intermittently over a longer period, this allows ample time for infection of
the host. Transmission is transtadial, i.e. by the next stage of the tick, and
transovarian transmission does not occur. The incubation period following
ticktransmission is8-24 days.
Geographical distribution: East and central Africa
Pathogenesis: The sequence of events in a typical acute and fatal
infection progresses through three phases, each spanning about 1 week.
The first is the incubation period of about l week when neither parasite
nor lesions can be detected. This is followed during the second week by
marked hyperplasia and expansion of the infected lymphoblast population.

T. parva lawrencei is transmitted from the African buffalo and becomes

Clinical signs: About 1 week after infection, in a fully susceptible animal,
the lymph node draining the area of tick bite, usually the parotid, becomes
enlarged and the animal becomes pyrexic (40-41.7°C; 104-107°F).
Within a few days there is generalised swelling of the superficial lymph

ceases rumination, becomes weak, with a rapid heartbeat, and petechial
haemorrhages may occur under the tongue and on the vulva. Affected
animals become emaciated and dyspnoeic and there is terminal diarrhoea,
often blood-stained. Recumbency and death almost invariably occur,
usually within 3 weeks of infection. Occasionally nervous signs, the
 presence of meronts in cerebral capillaries.
Milder infections show a mild fever lasting 3-7 days, listlessness and
swelling of superficial lymph nodes.
Diagnosis: East coast fever only occurs where R. appendiculatus is
present, although occasionally outbreaks outwith such areas have been
recorded due to the introduction of tick-infected cattle from an enzootic
area. In sick animals, macroschizonts are readily detected in biopsy
smears of lymph nodes and in dead animals in impression smears of
lymph nodes and spleen. In advanced cases, Giemsa-stained blood smears
show piroplasms in the red cells, up to 80% of which may be parasitised.
The indirect fluorescent antibody test is of value in detecting cattle, which
have recovered from east coast fever.
Pathology: Necropsy during the terminal phase shows lymph nodes are to
be swollen with atrophy of the cellular content of the lymph nodes and
variable hyperaemia. The spleen is usually enlarged with soft pulp and
yellow, with parenchymatous degeneration. The kidneys are either

kidney capsule may contain a large amount of serous fluid. There may be
petechiae in the visceral and parietal pleura, adrenal cortex, urinary
bladder and mediastinum. There are characteristic ulcers 2-5 mm or more
in diameter in the abomasum, small and large intestines. Peyer's patches
are swollen, and the intestinal contents yellowish.
Epidemiology: Since the tick vector, R. appendicuiatus, is most active
following the onset of rain, outbreaks of east coast fever may be seasonal
or, where rainfall is relatively constant, may occur at any time.
Fortunately, indigenous cattle reared in endemic areas show a high degree
of resistance and, although transient mild infection occurs in early life.
mortality is negligible. The mechanism of this resistance is unknown
However, such cattle may remain carriers and act as a reservoir of
infection for ticks. Susceptible cattle introduced into such areas suffer
high mortality, irrespective of age or breed, unless rigid precautions are
observed.
[n areas where the survival of the tick vector is marginal, challenge is low
and indigenous cattle may have little immunity. Such areas, during a
prolonged period of rain, may become ecologically suitable for the
survival and proliferation of the ticks, ultimately resulting in disastrous
outbreaks of east coast fever. In some parts of east and central Africa
where populations of cattle and wild African buffalo overlap there is an
additional epidemiological complication due to the presence of a strain of
T. parva, known as T. parva fawrencei. This occurs naturally in African
buffalo, many of which remain as carriers. The tick vector is also R.
appendiculatus and, in cattle, the disease causes high mortality. Since
infected ticks may survive for nearly 2 years, physical contact between
buffalo and cattle need not be close.
Treatment: Although the tetracyclines have a therapeutic effect if given
cases. The drugs of choice in clinical cases of east coast fever are the
anti-coccidial drug halofuginone.
    r  e    
improved cattle are raised has relied on legislation to control the
308
movement of cattle, on fencing to prevent access by nomadic cattle and
buffalo and on repeated treatment of cattle with acaricides. In areas of
high challenge, such treatments may require to be carried out twice
weekly in order to kill the tick before the infective sporozoites develop in
the salivary glands. This is not only expensive, but creates a population of
fully susceptible cattle; if the acaricide fails, through human error or the
acquisition of acaricide resistance by the ticks, the consequences can be
disastrous.
Great efforts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine, but these have
been thwarted by the complex immunological mechanisms involved in
immunity to east coast fever and by the discovery of immunologically
different strains of T. parva in the field. However, an “infection and
      s   n
stabilate of T. parva and long-acting tetracycline has been shown to be
successful, although it has not been used on a large scale as yet.
Apparently, the tetracycline slows the rate of schizogony, giving the
immune response time to develop.
Notes: Because of the wide distribution of its tick vector, Rhipicephalus,
 t s  o  a  i   a 
associated with a mortality of 100%, T. parva infection is an immense
obstacle to livestock improvement.

round (0.5-2.7 μm) to oval (2 × 0.6 μm), but may also be rod-shaped or
or four daughter cells, the latter in the shape of a cross. Koch bodies are in

diameter; these divide further to become micromeronts that contain
chromatin granules 0.3-0.8 μm in diameter and produce merozoites 0.7-1
μm in diameter.
Hosts: Cattle, domestic buffalo
Life cycle: Erythrocytic merozoites, ingested by the tick intermediate
host, develop into macro- and microgamonts to produce zygotes. These
develop and enter the haemolymph to become kinetes, which then enter
the salivary glands to become fission bodies. In adult ticks, the primary
fission bodies divide into secondary (primary sporoblasts) and tertiary
(secondary sporoblasts) fission bodies and produce sporozoites that are
released into the saliva. Cattle are infected when the ticks suck blood. The
sporozoites  enter  lymphocytes  and  become  meronts,  initially
macromeronts,  and  then  micromeronts.  Micromerozoites  enter
erythrocytes, and after a few binary fissions produce the varied forms that
are taken up by other ticks. The incubation period following tick
transmission is 9-25 days (mean 15 days).
Geographical distribution: Mediterranean countries (Portugal and Spain,
the Balkans), the Middle East, Indian subcontinent and China
Pathogenesis: The pathogenesis and clinical signs are initially similar to
those of east coast fever with pyrexia and lymph node enlargement, but in
the late stages there is a haemolytic anaemia and often icterus.
Convalescence is protracted in those cases that recover.
Clinical signs: [n the acute form there is fever (40-41.7°C; 104-107°F),
inappetence, cessation of rumination, rapid heartbeat, weakness, decreased
milk production, swelling of superficial lymph nodes and eyelids,
diarrhoea (containing blood and mucus), jaundice and petecchial
haemorrhages. Affected animals become emaciated and death can occur.
In the more chronic form there is intermittent fever, inappetence,
emaciation, anaemia and jaundice.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis depends on the detection of meronts in both lymph
node biopsy specimens and, unlike T. parva, in blood smears. A
low-grade piroplasm parasitaemia, in the absence of schizonts, is usually

lungs are usually oedematous; characteristic ulcers are present in the
abomasum, small and large intestines.
Epidemiology: T. annulata is transmitted transtadially by ticks of the
genus Hyalomma. Hyalomma detritum in north Africa; H. detritum and H.
Excavatum in the former Soviet States; H. truncatum in parts of Africa; H.
dromedarii in central Asia; H. excavatum, H. turanicum and H.
marginatum in Asia Minor; H. marginatum in India; and H. longicornis in
Siberia and the Far East. Like east coast fever, indigenous cattle in
endemic areas are relatively resistant while improved cattle, particularly
European breeds, are highly susceptible. However, unlike east coast fever
the disease in such cattle is not uniformly fatal, although the mortality rate
may reach 70%.
Congenital infection can occur occasionally in calves.
Treatment: See T. parva
Control: In many areas, the prevention of T. annulata infection in
imported dairy stock is based on permanent housing. However this is
expensive and there is always the possibility that infected ticks may be
brought in with the fodder to cause disease and colonise crevices in the
cattle accommodation. In some countries immunisation with meronts
attenuated by prolonged in vitro culture has given excellent results.
Theileriaorientaliscomplex
Synonyms: Theileria mutans, Theileria buffeli, Theileria sergenti
Common name: Benign theileriosis
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Theileriidae
Description: Trophozoite forms in erythrocytes are round (1-2 μm
diameter), oval (1.5 x 0.6 μm), pyriform, comma-shaped or
Anaplasma-like (Fig. 2.43). Binary fission produces two or four daughter
cells. There are relatively few Koch bodies (8-20 μm) in the lymphocytes
of the spleen and lymph nodes, which contain 1-80 chromatin granules
(1-2 μm in diameter).

Pathogenesis: Mildly pathogenic
Clinical signs: Similar in appearance to the mild form of T. annuiata
causing anaemia, with jaundice and lymphadenopathy occasionally
present.
Diagnosis: Giemsa-stained blood smears may show piroplasms in the red
nodes.
Pathology: In acute cases the spleen and liver are swollen, the lungs may
be oedematous and there are characteristic ulcers in the abomasum, and

vectors in Australia.
312
Treatment: Little information is available on treatment although the
drugs of choice in clinical cases are likely to be parvaquone and
buparvaquone.
Control: Tick control methods may be considered including fencing and
dipping or cleaning cattle of ticks but these are not usually required.
Notes: The taxonomy of benign theileriosis species is complicated and it
is now considered that T. orientalis is part of a complex with T. sergenti,
T.buffeli and T. mutans.

RICKETTSIALES
Several rickettsial organisms are of importance in cattle.
314
Anaplasma marginale
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Anaplasmataceae
Description: In Giemsa-stained blood films the organisms of A.
marginale are seen as small, round, dark red ‘inclusion bodies
approximately 0.3-1.0 μm within the red cell (Fig. 2.44). Often there is
only one organism in a red cell and characteristically this lies at the outer
 margin; however these two features are not constant.
Fig. 2.44 Intraerythrocytic stages of Anaplasma marginaie.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, wild ruminants
Life cycle: Anaplasma can be transmitted by ticks, and also mechanically
by biting flies or contaminated surgical instruments. Once in the blood,
the organism enters the red cell by invaginating the cell membrane so that
a vacuole is formed; thereafter it divides to form an inclusion body
containing up to eight ‘“initial bodies’ packed together. The inclusion
bodies are most numerous during the acute phase of the infection, but
some persist for years afterwards.
Geographical distribution: Africa, southern Europe, Australia, South
America, Asia, former Soviet states and USA
315
Pathogenesis: Typically, the changes are those of an acute febrile reaction
accompanied by a severe haemolytic anaemia. After an incubation period
of around 4 weeks, fever and parasitaemia appear, and as the latter
develops, the anaemia becomes more severe so that within a week or so up
to 70% of the erythrocytes are destroyed. The clinical signs are usually
very mild in naive cattle under 1 year old. Thereafter, susceptibility
increases so that cattle aged 2-3 years develop typical and often fatal
anaplasmosis, while in cattle over 3 years the disease is often peracute and
frequently fatal.
Clinical signs: Clinical signs are attributed to severe anaemia and include
depression,  weakness,
，fever, laboured breathing, inappetance,
dehydration, constipation and jaundice. The acute stage of the disease is
characterised by fever (39.441.7°C; 103-107°F) that persists for 3-7
days. During the febrile phase there is decreased rumination, dryness of
the muzzle, loss of appetite, dullness and depression. Lactating cows show
a depression in milk yield and abortion is a common feature in advanced
pregnancy. The severity of the disease increases with age, with animals
Diagnosis: The clinical signs supplemented, if possible, by a haematocrit
estimation and the demonstration of Anaplasma inclusions in the red cells,
are usually sufficient for diagnosis. For the detection of immune carriers,
complement fixation and agglutination tests are available; an indirect
fluorescent antibody test and DNA probe have also been developed.
Pathology: Gross pathological lesions are those usually associated with
tissues. The spleen is often greatly enlarged with enlarged splenic
follicles. The liver may be enlarged with rounded borders. The gallbladder
is enlarged and obstructed with dark, thick bile. Petechiae may be
observed on the epicardium, pericardium, pleura and diaphragm. The
lymph glands are enlarged. Microscopically there is hyperplasia of the
bone marrow. The spleen shows a decrease of lymphoblasts and increased
vacuolation and degeneration of reticular cells and there is reduction of
the white pulp and accumulation of pigment resembling haemosiderin.

annuiatus, B. decolaratus and B. micropius. In the USA, the main tick
vectors are Dermacentor andersoni, D.occidentalis and D. variabilis

horn flies and mosquitoes have also been incriminated as potential
ruminants such as deer. Cattle, especially adults, introduced into endemic

presumably due to previous exposure when young, although their acquired
immunity usually co-exists with a carrier state. This balance may, on
occasions, be disturbed and clinical anaplasmosis supervenes when cattle
are stressed by other diseases, such as babesiosis
Treatment: Tetracycline compounds are effective in treatment if given
early in the course of the disease and especially before the parasitaemia
has reached its peak. More recently, imidocarb has been shown to be
effective and may also be used to sterilise carrier animals.
Control: Vaccination of susceptible stock with small quantities of blood
containing the mildly pathogenic A. centrale or a relatively avirulent strain
of A. marginale is practised in several countries, any clinical signs in
adults being controlled by drugs. In the USA, a killed A. marginale
vaccine containing erythrocyte stroma is also available. Although all are
generally successful in the clinical sense, challenged cattle become
carriers and so perpetuate transmission. The killed vaccine has the
disadvantage that antibodies produced to the red cell stroma, if transferred
in the colostrum, may produce isoerythrolysis in nursing calves. Improved
inactivated vaccines are currently under development. Otherwise, control
at present depends largely on the reduction of ticks and biting flies.
Anaplasma centrale
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Anaplasmataceae
Description: As for A. marginaie, except that the organisms are
commonly found in the centre of the erythrocyte.
Hosts: Cattle, wild ruminants, and perhaps sheep, may act as reservoirs of
infection.
317
Geographical  distribution:  Worldwide  in  tropics  and  subtropics
including southern Europe. It is also present in some temperate areas,
including parts of the USA.
Pathogenesis: Similar to A. marginale but generally considered to be less
pathogenic.
Clinical signs: The clinical features include pyrexia, anaemia and often
jaundice, anorexia, laboured breathing and in cows, a severe drop in milk
yield or abortion. Occasionally peracute cases occur, which usually die
within a day of the onset of clinical signs.
Pathology: Necropsy at this time often reveals a jaundiced carcase, a
         
The spleen and lymph nodes are enlarged and congested and there are
petechial haemorrhages in the heart muscle. The urine, unlike that in
babesiosis, is normal in colour. In survivors, recovery is prolonged.
Epidemiology: Apart from the various modes of transmission described
above, little information is available. Reservoirs of infection are
maintained in carrier cattle and perhaps in wild ruminants or sheep. Cattle,
especially adults, introduced into endemic areas are particularly
susceptible, the mortality rate being up to 80%. In contrast, cattle reared in
endemic areas are much less susceptible, presumably due to previous
exposure when young, although their acquired immunity usually co-exists
with a carrier state. This balance may, on occasions be disturbed and
clinical anaplasmosis supervenes when cattle are stressed by other
diseases, such as babesiosis.

Ehrlichia ruminantium
Synonym: Cowdria ruminantum
Common name: Heartwater, cowdriosis, malkopsiekte (Afrikaans)
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Rickettsiaceae
Description: Organisms are seen as close-packed colonies consisting of
less than ten to many hundred cocci. The organism varies in size from 0.2
μm to greater than 1.5 μm. The diameter of individual organisms in a
given cluster is rather uniform but groups are very pleomorphic. The small
granules tend to be coccoid, with larger ones looking like rings,
horseshoes, rods and irregular masses.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goats and wild ruminants
Life cycle: Ehrlichia ruminantium is transmitted by at least five species of
reticuloendothelial cells and then parasitises vascular endothelial cells.
Division is by binary fission and it produces morulalike colonies in the
cytoplasm of infected cells.
Geographical distribution: Africa, south of the Sahara; Caribbean
(Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante and Antigua)
Hydropericardium may lead to cardiac insufficiency and hydrothorax and
pulmonary oedema to respiratory difficulties. Oedema is often so
pronounced in peracute heartwater that it is responsible for sudden death
by asphyxia. The occasional sudden fall in plasma volume preceding
death has been associated with the development of the transudates. Brain
lesions are not consistent enough to explain the nervous symptoms.
320
Clinical signs: The average natural incubation period is 2 weeks, but can
vary from 1o days to 1 month. [n most cases, heartwater is an acute febrile
disease, with a sudden rise in body temperature; temperature may exceed
41°℃ within 1-2 days. It remains high with small fluctuations and drops
shortly before death.
A peracute form occurs in exotic breeds introduced into an endemic
region. The animal appears clinically normal, but if examined will have a
die. Thoracic auscultation will often reveal oedema in the lungs and
bronchi.
In the acute form, fever is followed by inappetence, sometimes
listlessness, diarrhoea, particularly in cattle and dyspnoea indicative of
lung oedema. The course of infection is 3-6 days and consists of pyrexia
(often over 41°C; 106°F). A mild cough may be heard and, on
auscultation, hydrothorax, hydropericardium and lung oedema are noted.
s          si   
Nervous signs develop gradually. The animal is restless, walks in circles,
makes sucking movements and stands rigidly with tremors of the
superficial muscles. Cattle may push their head against a wall or present
aggressive or anxious behaviour. Finally, the animal falls to the ground,
pedalling and exhibiting opisthotonos,  nystagmus and chewing
movements. The animal usually dies during or following such a nervous
attack.
In the subacute form, the signs are like those of the acute form but they are
much less severe with a transient fever and sometimes diarrhoea. Disease
may last for over a week and the animal usually improves gradually but a
few cases progress to collapse and death. This is often the most severe
form seen in indigenous cattle, and those previously infected. In these
stock symptoms are usually absent.
Diagnosis: There is no specific method for diagnosis in the living animal.
Amblyomma vectors, of clinical nervous signs, and of transudates in the
 pericardium and thorax at postmortem examination. Provisional indication
can be from the history and clinical signs. Lymph node material can be
aspirated to examine for vacuoles containing organisms in the cytoplasm
of the reticular cells. Serum can be examined using a capillary flocculation
test. A number of serological tests have been described but all suffer from
321
species.
Diagnosis is easier at postmortem as the organism can be discerned in
brain tissue capillaries that have been fixed in methyl alcohol and stained
with Giemsa. Typical colonies of E. ruminantium can be observed in brain
smears made after death. Slides are examined for the presence of the
characteristic colonies. Experience is required to differentiate from other
haemoparasites (Babesia bovis), certain blood cells (thrombocytes,
granulocytes), normal subcellular structures (mitochondria, mast cell

and
hypomagnesaemia.
Pathology: The lesions present are very variable and not pathognomonic.
In the peracute form there are few gross lesions, but in some there is
marked lung oedema with tracheal and bronchial fluids. In the acute form
hydrothorax, pulmonary oedema, intestinal congestion, oedema of the
mediastinal and bronchial lymph nodes, petechiae on the epicardium and
endocardium, congestion of the brain, and moderate splenomegaly. The
liver is often engorged, with the gallbladder distended. The spleen is
occasionally enlarged. There may be congestion of the meningeal blood
vessels.
Epidemiology: Distribution of heartwater coincides with that of the
Amblyomma ticks, which require a warm humid climate and bushy grass.
A number of African species of the genus Amblyomma (A. haebrum, A.
variegatum,A.pomposum,A.gemma,A.lepidum,A.tholloni,A.sparsum,
A.astrion,A.cohaerens, A.marmoreum) and American species (A.

is only when susceptible exotic species are introduced that infection
becomes apparent. Besides cattle, sheep, goats, Asian buffalo, antelopes
and deer are susceptible to infection and disease. Indigenous cattle
undergo inapparent infection. Calves under 3 weeks old, even from
susceptible stock, are difficult to infect. Heartwater can occur throughout
activity. The incubation period is variable, from 7 to 28 days, with fever
starting on average after 18 days. Mortality can be up to 60% in exotic
breeds, but less than 5% in local cattle.
Treatment: Therapy is most effective when carried out early in disease.
Tetracyclines can be used and do not interfere with development of
immunity.
Control: Prevention is aimed at controlling the tick vector by dipping
cattle at weekly intervals with reliable acaricides. However, the ticks of
the genus Ambylomma are less susceptible than those from other genera
As the tick may transmit infection after 24 hours on the host, better control
should also be taken not to introduce Amblyomma on infected animals or
in forage to uninfected cows.
In areas where disease is endemic most cattle are immune. A carrier state
develops after infection and remains for several weeks. Non-infected
resistance persists a variable time, lasting from a few months to several
years. After this time reinfection can occur.
The only method of immunisation is an infection and treatment method
using infected blood or homogenised pre-fed infected ticks followed by
tetracycline treatment as soon as pyrexia develops.
Notes: Heartwater is one of the main obstacles to the improvement of
livestock productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. It was first recognised as a
major disease in southern Africa after the introduction of exotic breeds. [ts
There are very few reliable figures about its importance in local breeds in
endemic areas. However, there is no doubt that in endemic areas
indigenous cattle are far more resistant than exotic or crossbred cattle,
presumably because of natural selection. In contrast, small ruminants in
323
The name heartwater was used because hydropericardium was regarded as
a pathognomonic lesion of the disease. The disease is still also generally
known as 'cowdriosis'.

See Chapter 6 (Dogs and cats).
Thelaziarhodesi
Common name: Cattle eyeworm
Predilection site: Eye, conjunctival sac, lachrymal duct
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Small thin yellowish white worms, 1.0-2.0 cm long.
Males are 8-12 mm and females are 12-20 mm.
Description, microscopic: A mouth capsule is present and the cuticle has
prominent striations at the anterior end.
325
Final host: Cattle, buffalo, occasionally sheep, goat
Intermediate host: Muscid flies, particularly Fannia spp
Life cycle: The worms are viviparous. The L1 passed by the female worm
into the lachrymal secretion is ingested by the fly intermediate host as it
feeds. Development from L1 to L3 occurs in the ovarian follicles of the fly
in 15-30 days during the summer months. L3 migrate to the mouthparts of
           
Development in the eye takes place without further migration. The
prepatent period is 20-25 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Lesions are caused by the serrated cuticle of the worm and
most damage results from movement by the active young adults causing
lachrymation, followed by conjunctivitis. In heavy infections the cornea
may become cloudy and ulcerated. There is usually complete recovery in
about 2 months, although in some cases areas of corneal opacity can
persist. Infection may predispose to infectious keratoconjunctivitis ('pink
eye') caused by Moraxella.
Clinical signs: Lachrymation, conjunctivitis and photophobia. Flies are
usually clustered around the eye because of the excessive secretion. In
severe cases, the whole cornea can be opaque and without treatment,
progressive keratitis and ulceration of the cornea may occur.
Diagnosis: The presence of a conjunctivitis that is coincident with the
season of fly activity is an indication of possible infection. In some cases
the Thefazia worms may be seen on the surface of the conjunctiva or in
the conjunctival sac. Sometimes eggs or larvae can be recovered from
lachrymal secretions. It may be necessary to instil a few drops of local
anaesthetic to facilitate manipulation of the third eyelid.
Pathology: Invasion of the lachrymal gland and ducts may cause
inflammation and necrotic exudation leading to occlusion and reduced tear
production.   Mechanical   irritation   of  the   conjunctivitis  produces
inflammation, whilst damage to the cornea leads to opacity, keratitis and
corneal ulceration.
Epidemiology: Thelazia infections occur seasonally and are linked to
periods of maximum fly activity. The parasite can survive in the eye for
326
several years, but since it is only the young adult which is pathogenic a
reservoir of infection may persist in symptomless carrier cattle. Survival
of larvae also occurs in the pupal stages of flies during the winter.
Treatment: Treatment was at one time based on manual removal of the
worms under a local anaesthetic, but this is now replaced by administering
drug may be applied topically as a 1% aqueous solution.
Control: Prevention is difficult because of the ubiquitous nature of the fly

Description: The organism is pear-shaped, approximately 10-25 μm long
and 3-15 μm wide and has a single nucleus and four flagella, each arising
from a basal body situated at the anterior rounded end. Three of the
flagella are free anteriorly, while the fourth extends backwards to form an
undulating membrane along the length of the organism and then continues
posteriorly as a free flagellum (Figs 2.45, 2.46). The axostyle, a hyaline
rod with a skeletal function, extends the length of the cell and usually
 projects posteriorly. The costa is prominent but there is no pelta.

undulating membrane being readily seen. Occasionally, rounded immobile
forms are observed and these are possibly effete.
Hosts: Cattle
Life cycle: The trichomonads reproduce by longitudinal binary fission. No
sexual stages are known and there are no cysts. Transmission occurs
during coitus.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. However, the prevalence has
now decreased dramatically in areas where artificial insemination is
widely practised and in Britain, for example, the disease is now probably
extinct.
Pathogenesis: In the bull, a preputial discharge associated with small
nodules on the preputial and penile membranes may develop shortly after
infection. Organisms are present in small numbers in the preputial cavity
of bulls, with some concentration in the fornix and around the glans penis.
The chronically infected bull shows no gross lesions.
In the cow, the initial lesion is a vaginitis, which can be followed in
Various sequelae can result, including a placentitis leading to early
abortion (1-l6 weeks), uterine discharge and pyometra. Abortion before
the fourth month of pregnancy is the commonest sequel and this is

normallyfollowedbyrecovery.Occasionallythe developing fetal
membranes are retained leading to a purulent endometritis, a persistent
uterine discharge and anoestrus; infrequently the corpus luteum is retained
and the cervical seal remains closed, when a massive pyometra develops
which visually simulates the appearance of pregnancy. In some cases,
despite infection, pregnancy is not terminated by abortion and a normal,
full-term calf isborn.
Clinical signs: In the bull, there are no clinical signs once the infection is
established. In the cow, early abortion is a characteristic feature although
this is often undetected because of the small size of the fetus and the case
may present as one of an irregular oestrus cycle. Other clinical signs are
those of purulent endometritis or a closed pyrometra and, in these cases,
the cow may become permanently sterile. On a herd basis, cows exhibit
irregular oestrous cycles, uterine discharge, pyometra and early abortion.
The cow usually recovers and generally becomes immune, at least for that
breeding season, after infection or abortion.
Diagnosis: A tentative diagnosis of trichomonosis is based on the clinical
history, signs of early abortion, repeated returns to service, or irregular
oestrous cycles. Confirmation depends on the demonstration of organisms
in placental fluid, stomach contents of the aborted fetus, uterine washings,
pyometra discharge or vaginal mucus. Apart from a problem of infertility,
which usually follows the purchase of a mature bull, confirmation of
diagnosis depends on the demonstration of the organism. Vaginal mucus

Alternatively, on a herd basis, samples of vaginal mucus may be examined

Pathology: Infection in females causes cervicitis and endometritis leading
to infertility, abortion or pyometra. The inflammatory changes in the
endometrium and cervix are relatively mild and non-specific, although
continuous or intermittent in their discharge, and the number and activity
of the trichomonads can vary considerably. Abortions may occur at any
time but mainly in the first half of pregnancy. There are no specific fetal
lesions, but large numbers of protozoa may be found in the fetal fluids and
          
exudates in small amounts, and thickening and haemorrhage without
may be copious with watery exudates containing floccules which may be
brownish and sticky and contain swarms of trichomonads.
Epidemiology: Bulls, once infected, remain so permanently. The
organisms inhabit the preputial cavity and transmission to the cow occurs
during coitus. From the vagina, the trichomonads reach the uterus via the
cervix to produce a low-grade endometritis. Intermittently, organisms are
flushed into the vagina, often 2 or 3 days before oestrus. Infection is
   
amniotic and allantoic fluid. Subsequently cows appear to 'self cure’ and,
in most cases, appear to develop a sterile immunity.
In the bull, slaughter is the best policy, although dimetridazole orally or
intravenously has been reported to be effective.
Control: Artificial insemination from non-infected donors is the only
entirely satisfactory method of control. If a return to natural service is
332
contemplated, recovered cows should be disposed of since some may be
carriers.
Notes: Normally one might expect the overall prevalence of
trichomonosis to be high, since it is venereally transmitted by bulls, which
show no clinical signs. In fact, the advent of supervised schemes of
artificial insemination has largely eradicated the disease, and today it is
limited to areas where there are many small farms each with their own
bulls, or to countries where veterinary supervision is limited.
[In a few early studies, three serotypes were recognised based on
agglutination: the ‘Belfast” strain, reportedly predominated in Europe,
Africa and the USA; the ^Brisbane’ strain in Australia; and the *Manley
strain, which has been reported in only a few outbreaks.
Neospora caninum
Synonym: Histopiasma gondii
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystiidae
Description: Tachyzoites measure 6 × 2 μm and are usually located in the
cytoplasm of cells. Tissue cysts are oval, 107 μm long, have a thick wall
(up to 4 μm) and are found only in neural tissue.
Intermediate hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat
Final host: Dog
Life cycle: The complete life cycle of Neospora caninum has only
gondii because of the structural similarity of the asexual stages of the two
parasites. Similarities between the two organisms suggested that N.
caninum was a coccidian parasite whose infective stage was an oocyst.
The definitive stage has recently been shown to be dogs, which pass small
numbers of oocysts in faeces from 8-23 days after infection. Tissue cysts
are tachyzoites and can infect a range of animals including cattle, sheep,
goats and horses. The dog can also act as an intermediate host.
333
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: N. caninum is a major cause of abortion in both dairy and
beef cattle. Cows of any age can abort from 3 months of gestation to full
alive or may die in utero and be mummified or reabsorbed. Calves that are
infected may be born underweight and with neurological symptoms such
as ataxia, decreased reflexes and exophthalmia.
[nfection is thought to reduce milk production in adult diary cows through
its effects on fertility.
Clinical signs: Abortion, mummification, weak calves with ataxia,
exophthalmia
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on histological examination of freshly
aborted fetuses. The lesions in the heart and central nervous system (CNS)
is commercially available and can be used to test serum samples for
Neospora-specific antibodies. The ELISA results are expressed as a
(PP) values. Results are negative if less than 20 PP; inconclusive if
between 20 and 25 PP; and positive if greater than 25 PP.
CNS and retina of affected cattle. Although infection can be found in
many organs, the commonest site is the brain. Microscopic lesions of
seen in the brain, spinal cord and heart. Hepatitis can also be found in
epidemic abortions.
Epidemiology: The dog is the final host, and is also an intermediate host
in prenatal infections. In cattle, infection can be both vertically transmitted
from dam to calf in utero and lactogenically, naturally by ingestion of
food and water contaminated with dog faeces containing Neospora
caninum oocysts, or from cow to cow. The mechanisms of repeat
congenital transmission are unknown at present.
[In cattle, most abortions occur either sporadically on farms with annual
annual abortion rates of 5-l0%. Occasionally abortion rates may reach
334
30%, being more common during late summer. It is possible for cattle that
abortion and infected cows are more likely to abort than non-infected
cows. Cows infected with N. caninum are also likely to infect more than
95% of their calves by transplacental infection.
Treatment: There is no effective treatment in cattle.
Control: Control of Neospora-induced abortion in cattle depends on
faeces of any animal and the disposal of aborted fetuses and placentas by
incineration. The lack of complete knowledge of both the life cycle and
the range of definitive hosts has limited effective control measures but
there is a strong argument for the culling of seropositive animals from a
herd. Seropositive animals have been shown to suffer a higher risk of
abortion than seronegative animals in the herd. Dogs should not be
allowed to eat aborted fetuses or fetal membranes, and their faeces should
be prevented from contaminating bovine feedstuffs.

oval, about 0.5-1.0 × 0.5 cm long, and filled with fluid in which the
scolex is usually clearly visible. As in the adult tapeworm, it has neither
rostellum nor hooks.
Description, microscopic: The uterus of the gravid proglottid has 15-30
lateral branches on each side of the central stem, in contrast to that of T.
solium with only 7-12 lateral branches. Gravid proglottids may contain
around 100 000-200 000 eggs, each being approximately circular with a
smooth thick shell, and measuring 30-50 × 20-30 μm.
A subspecies, Taenia saginata asiatica, has a rostellum and posterior
protruberances on segments and 11-32 uterine buds. The metacestodes are
small, about 2 mm, and have a rostellum and two rows of primitive hooks,
those of the outer row being numerous and tiny.
Final host: Man
Intermediate host: Cattle
Life cycle: An infected human may pass millions of eggs daily, either free
and these can survive on pasture for several months. After ingestion by a
susceptible bovine, the oncosphere travels via the blood to striated muscle.
It is first grossly visible about 2 weeks later as a pale, semi-transparent
spot about 1.0 mm in diameter, but is not infective to man until about 12
weeks later when it has reached its full size of 1.0 cm. By then it is

frequently present in the same carcase. Humans become infected by
ingesting raw, or inadequately cooked meat. Development to patency
takes 2-3 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. Particularly important in Africa
and South America.
336
Pathogenesis: Although C. bovis may occur anywhere in the striated
muscles the predilection sites, at least from the viewpoint of routine meat
inspection, are the heart, the tongue and the masseter and intercostal
muscles (Fig. 2.47). Under natural conditions the presence of cysticerci in
the muscles of cattle is not associated with clinical signs although,
experimentally, calves given massive infections of T. saginata eggs have
developed severe myocarditis and heart failure associated with developing
cysticerci in the heart.
Fig. 2.47 Cysticercus bovis in skeletal muscle.
Clinical signs: In humans, the adult tapeworm may produce diarrhoea and
hunger pains, but the infection is usually asymptomatic and is mainly
objectionable on aesthetic grounds.
Diagnosis: Individual countries have different regulations regarding the
inspection of carcases, but invariably the masseter muscle, tongue and
heart are incised and examined and the intercostal muscles and diaphragm
inspected; the triceps muscle is also incised in many countries. The
the preservation of the economic value of the carcase.
[mmunoserology has some usefulness for screening infected herds. In
humans, the presence of tapeworms is recognised by the passage of
proglottids and/or eggs in faeces.
337
Pathology: Cysticerci commence to degenerate 4-6 months after infection
and by 9 months a substantial number may be dead. With light infections
cysticerci may remain viable for 2 years or more.
Epidemiology: There are two quite distinct epidemiological patterns
found in developing countries and developed countries respectively.
· Developing countries. In many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin
America cattle are reared on an extensive scale, human sanitation is
circumstances the incidence of human infection with T. saginata is
high, in certain areas being well over 20%. Because of this, calves
are usually infected in early life, often within the first few days
after birth, from infected stockmen whose hands are contaminated
with Taenia eggs. Prenatal infection of calves may also occur, but
completely resistant to further infection. Based on routine carcase
inspection, the infection rate is often around 30-60%, although the
real prevalence is considerably higher.
Australia and New Zealand, the standards of sanitation are high and
meat is carefully inspected and generally thoroughly cooked before
consumption. In such countries, the prevalence of cysticercosis is
low, being less than 1% of carcases inspected. Occasionally
however, a cysticercosis ^storm', where a high proportion of cattle
are infected, has been reported on particular farms. In Britain and in
Australia, this has been associated with the use of human sewage
on pasture as a fertiliser in the form of sludge, ie. sedimented or
bacterial-digested faeces. Since T. saginata eggs may survive for
perhaps not surprising. Other causes of a sudden high incidence of
stockman occurring either as a random event or, as has been
reported from feedlots in some of the southern states of the USA, as
a result of the use of migrant labour from a country with a high
prevalence of infection. As distinct from these ^storms', the cause
of the low but persistent prevalence of infection in cattle is obscure,
but is thought to be due to the access of cattle to water
contaminated with sewage effluents, to the carriage and dispersal of
338
T. saginata eggs by birds which frequent sewage works or feed on
effluent discharged into rivers or the sea, and to occasional fouling
of pasture by itinerant infected individuals. In contrast to the
epidemiology in developing countries, cattle of any age are
 o s     
immunity. There is also evidence that when cattle are first infected
as adults the longevity of the cysticerci is limited, most being dead
within 9 months.
Treatment: As yet there is no licensed drug available which will
effectively destroy all of the cysticerci in the muscle, although
praziquantel has shown efficacy in experimental situations.
Control: In developed countries the control of bovine cysticercosis
 depends on a high standard of human sanitation, on the general practice of
cooking meat thoroughly (the thermal death point of cysticerci is 57°C)
and on compulsory meat inspection. Regulations usually require that
infected carcases are frozen at -l0°C for at least 10 days which is
sufficient to kill the cysticerci, although the process reduces the economic
value of the meat. Where relatively heavy infections of more than 25
cysticerci are detected, it is usual to destroy the carcase. In agricultural
practice the use of human sludge as a fertiliser should be confined to
cultivated fields or to those on which cattle will not be grazed for at least 2
years. In developing countries the same measures are necessary, but are
not always economically feasible, and at present the most useful step
and the thorough cooking of meat.

SARCOCYSTOSIS
The previously complex nomenclature for the large number of Sarcocystis
   s     o  
to systematists, this practice has the virtue of simplicity (Table 2.3).
Life cycle
The life cycle for all species is heteroxenous. Sexual stages occur in the
predator and oocysts are passed in the faeces. The intermediate host is
infected by ingestion of sporocysts. The final host becomes infected by
e  rsn s  s a go us
the prey animal.
Diagnosis
when the grossly visible sarcocysts in the muscle are discovered.
However, in heavy infections of cattle, diagnosis is based on the clinical
signs and on histological demonstration of meronts in the blood vessels of
 Organs, such as kidney or heart, and the presence of cysts in the muscles at
necropsy or biopsy. An indirect haemagglutination test, using bradyzoites
as antigen, is also a useful aid to diagnosis; however, the presence of a
titre need not imply active lesions of Sarcocystis. Also, animals may die
 prior to a detectable humoral response. In cattle, the degenerative muscle
changes closely resemble those of vitamin E-selenium deficiency,
although the latter lacks an inflammatory cellular response. Examination
of faeces from dogs or cats on the farm for the presence of sporocysts may
be helpful in the diagnosis.
Epidemiology
Little is known of the epidemiology, but from the high prevalence of
symptomless infections observed in abattoirs, it is clear that where dogs or
341
cats are kept in close association with farm animals or their feed, then
the transmission of S. bovicanis and farm cats in the transmission of S.
bovifelis so care should be exercised that only cooked meat is fed to dogs
or cats. Acute outbreaks are probably most likely when livestock, which
have been reared without dog or cat contact, are subsequently exposed to
large numbers of the sporocysts from dog or cat faeces. The longevity of
the sporocysts shed in the faeces is not known.
Treatment and control
There is no effective treatment for infection, either in the final or in the
intermediate host. Where an outbreak occurs in cattle, it has been
suggested that the introduction of amprolium (100 mg/kg, per os, daily
over 30 days) into the diet of the animals has a prophylactic effect.
The only control measures possible are those of simple hygiene. Farm
dogs and cats should not be housed in, or allowed access to, fodder stores
nor should they be allowed to defecate in pens where livestock are housed.
Sarcocystis bovicanis
Synonym: Sarcocystis cruzi, Sarcocystis fusiformis
Predilection site: Muscle
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystiidae
Fig. 2.48 Sarcocystis bovicanis.
342
Deseription: In cattle, the meronts found in the endothelial cells are quite
small, measuring 28 μm in diameter. In contrast, the bradyzoite cysts can
be very large and visible to the naked eye as whitish streaks running in the
direction of the muscle fibres. They have been reported as reaching
several centimetres in length, but more commonly they range from
0.5-5.0 mm (Fig. 2.48). The cyst wall is thin and smooth and has a small
number of flattened protrusions 0.3-0.6 μm long, without fibrils.
Intermediate hosts: Cattle
Final hosts: Dog, fox, wolf, coyote
Life cycle: The definitive final host is the dog. Infection is by ingestion of
the sporocysts and this is followed by at least three asexual generations. In
the first, sporozoites, released from the sporocysts, invade the intestinal
wall and enter the capillaries where they locate in endothelial cells in the
caecum, large intestine, kidney, pancreas and mesenteric lymph node, and
circulating lymphocytes, the resulting merozoites penetrating skeletal and
cardiac muscle cells. There they encyst and then divide by a process of
budding or endodyogeny giving rise to broad banana-shaped bradyzoites
contained within a cyst; this is the mature sarcocyst and is the infective
stage for the carnivorous final host.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
343
Pathogenesis: Infection in the final host is normally non-pathogenic.
although mild diarrhoea has occasionally been reported. The principal
pathogenic effect is attributable to the second stage of merogony in the
vascular endothelium. Heavy experimental infections of calves with S.
bovicanis have resulted in mortality l month later, with, at necropsy,
petechial haemorrhages in almost every organ including the heart, together
with generalised lymphadenopathy. Experimental infection of adult cows
has resulted in abortion.
A naturally occurring chronic disease of cattle, ^Dalmeny disease', has
been recognised in Canada, the USA and Britain. This is characterised by
emaciation, submandibular oedema, recumbency and exophthalmia; at
postmortem examination, numerous meronts are found in endothelial
cells, and developing sarcocysts in areas of degenerative myositis.
Clinical signs: In heavy infections there is anorexia, fever, anaemia, loss
of weight, a disinclination to move and sometimes recumbency. In cattle.

a wide range of change may be encountered. Microscopic inspection of

which are eosinophils) or, at a later stage, macrophages and granulation

developing cysts, but generally very low numbers of Sarcocystis produce
no reaction. As cysts mature, the cyst capsule within the enlarged muscle

Description: The first-generation meronts are 37 × 22 μm and contain
more than 100 tachyzoites. Second-generation meronts when mature are
14 x 6.5m and contain up to 35 tachyzoites. Sarcocysts are up to 8 mm
long with a striated wall, 7 μm thick, and may be visible to the naked eye

Life cycle: The definitive final host is the cat. Infection is by ingestion of
the sporocysts and this is followed by at least two asexual generations. In
the intermediate host, the first-generation meronts are located in
mesenteric and intestinal arterioles. Second-generation meronts when
mature are found in capillaries of striated muscle and the heart, from
which the resulting merozoites penetrate striated muscle cells, most
commonly in the oesophageal muscle. There they encyst and metrocytes
are formed within the cyst, which divide repeatedly by endodyogeny to
the final host.

Pathogenesis:  Infections  are  generally  non-pathogenic;  and  any
pathogenic effect is attributable to the second stage of merogony in the
vascular endothelium.
Clinical signs: Infections are usually asymptomatic. Heavy infections
may occasionally produce anorexia, fever, diarrhoea, anaemia and weight
loss.

infective stage for humans.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The species is slightly if at all pathogenic for calves.
Clinical signs: Infection is usually asymptomatic in calves.

Pathogenic effects are always related to the extra-intestinal phase of

produce areas of necrosis in vital organs such as the myocardium, lungs,

lymphadenopathy occurs.  As the disease progresses bradyzoites are
formed, this chronic phase being usually asymptomatic.
Clinical signs: There are only a few reports of clinical toxoplasmosis
associated with fever, dyspnoea, nervous signs and abortion in cattle.

infected blackflies feed on another bovine host transmission of L3 occurs.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. In Australia and North America
the parasite, O. lienalis (considered to be synonymous) is found in the

incubated for about 8-12 hours. The microfilariae are readily recognised
option is to scarify the skin of a predilection site and examine the fluid
ex udate for microfilariae.
Pathology: Adult worms, which are found in pairs, are most frequently
located in the ligamentum nuchae adjacent to the thoracic spines and less
frequently in the connective tissue on the scapula, humerus and femur.
The worms do not stimulate nodule formation but lie loose in the
connective tissue and cause no disease or reaction.
Epidemiology: The incidence of infection can be very high in endemic
areas, although the parasite is rarely detected.
Treatment: Not required.
Control: With the ubiquity of the insect vectors there is little possibility
of efficient control, though the use of microfilaricides will reduce the
numbers of infected flies. In any case, with the relatively innocuous nature
of the infection there is unlikely to be any demand for control.

Onchocerca gibsoni
Predilection site: Connective tissue
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: The slender worms range from 2 to over 20 cm in
length and lie tightly coiled in tissue nodules. Males are 3-5 cm and
females 14-20 cm, although there have been reports of worms up to 50 cm
in length.
Description, microscopic: The tail of the male is curved and bears lateral
alae and six to nine papillae at either side. The spicules are unequal in
size. Microfilariae are not sheathed and are 240-280 μm long
Final host: Cattle
Intermediate host: Midges (Cuficoides)
Life cycle: As for O. gutturosa
Geographical distribution: Africa, Asia and Australasia
Pathogenesis: Worms occur in groups 'worm nests', and provoke a
fibrous reaction around the coiled-up worms in muscle tissue (nodules can
measure up to 5 cm in diameter). The nodules are often in the brisket and
can be responsible for economic loss due to carcase trimming.
Clinical signs: Affected animals are not clinically ill and show no
presenting signs other than subcutaneous nodules at the predilections sites.
Diagnosis: In active lesions, the presence of worms is readily established
on section of the subcutaneous nodules. Microfilariae may also be found
in skin biopsy samples taken from affected areas with subcutaneous lymph
spaces. The microfilariae are concentrated in the preferred feding sites of
the vectors, which for Culicoides spp are usually the shaded lower parts of
the trunk, and it is usually recommended that samples should be taken

incubated for about 8-12 hours. The microfilariae are readily recognised
by their sinuous movements in a centrifuged sample of the saline. Another
option is to scarify the skin of a predilection site and examine the fluid
exudate for microfilariae.
Pathology: A nodule forms around the worms with the head becoming
fixed and surrounded by fibroblasts. Successive portions of the worm are
drawn into the nodule, where they eventually lie coiled up and surrounded
by a fibrous tissue capsule, which increases in thickness as the lesion
grows older. In older nodules, degeneration of the tissues and calcification
of the worms frequently takes place. The capsule consists of dense fibrous

areas.
Treatment: In the past this has consisted of daily administration of
diethylcarbamazine over a period as a microfilaricide, but it now appears
that a single dose of ivermectin is highly efficient in this respect, although
the dying microfilariae may provoke local tissue reactions. Affected
carcases must be trimmed to remove the nodules.
Control: With the ubiquity of the insect vectors, there is little possibility
of efficient control, though insect repellents will help reduce insect attack.
In any case, with the relatively innocuous nature of the infection there is
unlikely to be any demand for control.

Pathogenesis: O. ochengi in the skin causes some economic loss from
blemished hides.
Clinical signs: Affected animals are not clinically ill and show no
 presenting signs other than subcutaneous nodules at the predilection sites.
Diagnosis: As for O. gibsoni
Pathology: Not reported
Epidemiology: The incidence of infection can be very high in endemic
areas.

Parafilaria bovicola
Common name: Summer *bleeding disease', verminous nodules
Predilection site: Subcutaneous and intermuscular connective tissue
Parasite class: Nematoda
352
Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: Slender white worms 3.0-6.0 cm in length. Males are
2-3 cm and females 45 cm.
Description, microscopic: Anteriorly, there are numerous papillae and
circular ridges in the cuticle. In the female the vulva is situated anteriorly
near the simple mouth opening.
Small embryonated eggs, 45 × 30 μm, that have a thin flexible shell are
laid on the skin surface where they hatch to release the microfilariae or L1,
which are about 200 μm in length.
Final hosts: Cattle, buffalo
Intermediate hosts: Muscid flies; Musca autumnalis in Europe
Life cycle: Eggs or free L1 larvae present in exudates from bleeding
points in the skin surface are ingested by muscid flies (e-g. M. autumnafis
in Europe; and M. fusoria and M. xanthomeias in Africa), in which they
develop to L3 within several weeks to months, depending on air
temperature. Transmission occurs when infected flies feed on lachrymal
secretions or skin wounds in other cattle and the L3 deposited then migrate
in the subcutaneous tissue and develop to the adult stage under the skin in
5-7 months. Bleeding points develop 7-9 months after infection, which is
about the same duration as patency.
Geographical distribution: Africa, Asia, southern Europe and Sweden
Pathogenesis: Adult worms in the subcutaneous connective tissue induce
small inflammatory lesions and haemorrhagic nodules, usually in the
upper body regions. When the gravid female punctures the skin to lay her
eggs there is a haemorrhagic exudate or bleeding point’ which streaks
and mats the surrounding hairs and attracts flies. Individual lesions only
bleed for a short time and healing is rapid. There is some evidence that
exposure to sunlight is required to initiate bleeding of the nodules.
At the sites of infection, which are predominantly on the shoulders,
withers and thoracic areas, there is inflammation and oedema which, at
meat inspection, resemble subcutaneous bruising in early lesions and have
a gelatinous greenish yellow appearance with a metallic odour in
longer-standing cases.Sometimes the lesions extendintothe
353
intermuscular fascia. The affected areas have to be trimmed at marketing
and further economic loss is incurred by rejection or downgrading of the
hides.
Clinical signs: The signs of parafilarioidosis, such as *bleeding points′
during the warmer seasons, are pathognomonic. Active bleeding lesions
are seen most commonly in warm weather, an apparent adaptation to
coincide with the presence of the fly intermediate host. The haemorrhagic
exudate often streaks the hair and may lead to focal matting.
Diagnosis: This is normally based on clinical signs, but if laboratory
confirmation is required, the small embryonated eggs or microfilariae may
be found on examination of fresh exudate from bleeding points. The
demonstration of eosinophils in smears taken from lesions is also
considered a constant diagnostic feature. Serodiagnosis, using an ELISA
technique has been developed.
Pathology: Nodules formed in  the cutaneous and intermuscular
connective tissue are 1-2 cm in diameter, enlarge in the summer months,
Epidemiology: In Europe, bovine parafilarioidosis occurs in spring and
summer, disappearing in winter, whereas in tropical areas it is seen mainly
after the rainy season. A high prevalence of 36% in cattle has been

areas, but its spread will depend on the presence of specific fly vectors. It
has been estimated in Sweden that one ^bleeding’ cow will act as a source
of infection for three other animals
Treatment: Patent infections in beef and non-lactating dairy cattle may be
treated with ivermectin, moxidectin or nitroxynil. The former two drugs
are given parenterally as a single dose whereas two doses of nitroxynil are
required at an interval of 3 days. None of these drugs is licensed for use in
drugs produce a marked reduction in bleeding points and, due to
resolution of the muscle lesions, a significant reduction in meat
condemnation if slaughter is delayed for 70 days after treatment.
354
Control: This is difficult, because of the long prepatent period during
which drugs are thought not to be effective. [n Sweden, dairy cattle and
particularly heifers at pasture, are the main source of infection for M.
autumnalis, which is an outdoor fly, active in spring and summer.
However, infections in young beef cattle are the chief cause of economic
loss through carcase damage.
Since neither ivermectin nor nitroxynil is effective against immature
worms, treatment is only useful for patent infections recognisable by the
clinical signs. However, because of restrictions on the use of ivermectin
and nitroxynil in lactating cows, these are rarely treated and instead are
kept indoors during the period of fly activity.
In endemic areas, young beef cattle may be treated with an anthelmintic
some time before slaughter as described above. In Sweden the use of

Notes: The adults of this genus of primitive filarioids live under the skin
where they produce inflammatory lesions or nodules and, during egg
laying, haemorrhagic exudates or *bleeding points' on the skin surface.
Setaria labiato-papillosa
Synonym: Setaria cervi

40-60 mm and females 60-120 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: The tail of the female ends in a marked button,
which is divided into a number of papillae. Microfilariae are sheathed and
measure 240-260 μm.
355
Final hosts: Cattle, buffalo, bison, yak, and various deer, rarely sheep
Intermediate hosts: Mosquitoes (Aedes, Culex)
Life cycle: Larvae produced by adult worms in the body cavity circulate
in the blood and are taken up by culicine mosquitoes, including Aedes and
Culex species. Infective larvae develop in the mosquito muscles in 12-16
days, and are re-injected into the final host when the mosquitoes feed. The
prepatent period is 8-10 months.
Fig. 2.50 Worms of Setaria spp in the mesentery.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The worms in their normal site are usually harmless
occasionally inducing a mild fibrinous peritonitis and are only discovered
at necropsy. S. fabiato-papillosa may have an erratic migration in sheep
and goats and enter the spinal canal causing cerebrospinal setariosis,
*lumbar paralysis', which is irreversible and often fatal; the condition has
only been reported in the Middle and Far East.
Clinical signs: There are no clinical signs when the worms are in their
normal site, but when nervous tissue is involved there is locomotor
disturbance, usually of the hind limbs, and if the parasites are high in the
spinal canal there may be paraplegia
356
Diagnosis: Infection with the adult worms is only accidentally discovered
in the living animal by the finding of microfilariae in routine blood
smears. In cases of cerebrospinal nematodosis, confirmatory diagnosis is
only possible by microscopic examination of the spinal cord, since the
 parasites exist only as larval forms in their aberrant site.

brown foci or streaks grossly. The lesions show microcavitation and
variable haemorrhage. There is loss of myelin and fragmentation of axons
locally with eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages present along with
a mild meningitis and vascular cuffing.
Epidemiology: Since the worms are usually innocuous, their
epidemiology has received little study. The prevalence is higher in warmer
countries, where there is longer seasonal activity of the mosquito vectors.
Treatment: There is no treatment for setarial paralysis
Control: This would depend on control of the mosquito vectors, which is

sheep, goats and horses causing epizootic cerebrospinal nematodiosis.
Affected animals suffer from acute focal encephalomyelomalacia, which
causes acute or subacute tetraplegia or paraplegia of the hindlimbs.
Pathology: Migrating larvae in abherent hosts affecting the CNS may
cause areas of damage seen as brown foci or streaks grossly. Acute
malacia occurs in the track of the worm such that the lesions show
microcavitation and variable haemorrhage. There is loss of myelin and
fragmentation of axons locally with eosinophils, neutrophils and
macrophages present along with a mild meningitis and vascular cuffing.

PARASITES OF THE
INTEGUMENT
Stephanofilaria stilesi
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: Small nematodes; males are 2.6-3.7 mm and females
3.7-6.9 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: There are four to five cephalic spines and
18-19 peribuccal spines. The male spicules are unequal and the female
worms have no anus. The thin-shelled eggs are 58-72 × 42-55 μm in size.
Microfilariae are 45-60 μm in length and are characterised by a peribuccal
elevation with a single spine and a short and rounded tail.
Final host: Cattle
358
Intermediate hosts:Thehorn fly (Haematobia irritians,H.titillans)
Life cycle: The fly vectors are attracted to the open lesions in the skin
caused by the adult parasites, and ingest the microfilariae in the exudate.
Development to L3 takes about 3 weeks, and the final host is infected
when the flies deposit larvae on normal skin.
Geographical distribution: USA, Japan, Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS)
Pathogenesis: Lesions begin to appear within 2 weeks of infection. In this
species, the lesions are usually localised to the preferred biting areas of the
vectors on the lower abdomen, commonly along the midventral line
between the brisket and navel, but also on the udder, scrotum, flanks and
ears. The flies feed predominantly along the midventral line of the host
and their bites create lesions that permit microfilariae to invade the skin.
These lesions are attractive to both species of hornflies as well as
non-biting  muscids.   Adult  nematodes  occur  in  the dermis  and
microfilariae in the dermal papillae of lesions but not in adjacent healthy
tissue.
Clinical signs: In endemic regions, granulomatous and ulcerative lesions

Diagnosis: Though adult worms and microfilariae are present in the
lesions they are often scarce and many scrapings prove negative.
Diagnosis is therefore usually presumptive in endemic areas, and is based
on the appearance and site of the lesions. Deep skin scrapings macerated
in saline will release microfilariae and adult worms. Biopsy sections
readily reveal microfilariae and adults.
Pathology: The skin is at first nodular, but later there is papular eruption
with an exudate of blood and pus. In the centre of the lesion there may be
sloughing of the skin, but at the margin there is often hyperkeratosis and
alopecia. The condition is essentially an exudative, often haemorrhagic,

of herbage. Succulent grazing produces soft, moist faeces, which are more
359
suitable breeding sites for the flies than the hard crumbly faeces deposited
on sparse dry grazing. Hence, irrigation of pasture may result in an
increase of stephanofilariosis. Though the lesions subside in cooler
weather, the damage to the hide is permanent and may result in
the pain of the lesions and the irritation of cattle by the flies.
Treatment: Organophosphorus compounds, such as trichlorophon.
applied topically as an ointment have proved effective. Levamisole at
9-12 mg/kg by injection followed by daily application of zinc oxide
ointment has also been reported as effective. Avermectins have reported
stages.
Control: Control of hornflies is feasible by the proper handling of manure
and the use of insecticides. Macrocyclic lactones applied topically give
reported protection against hornflies for period of up to 5 weeks.

around 100 cm in length.
Description, microscopic: The female worm has no vulva.
Final host: Man and occasionally cattle, horse dog, cat and other

Besnoiia besnoiti
Predilection site: Skin, conjunctiva
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystiidae
Description: The pseudocysts are non-septate and about 100-600 μm in
diameter, with a thick wall containing thousands of merozoites but no
metrocytes.
Intermediate hosts: Cattle, goats, wild ruminants (wildebeest, impala,

Final host: Cat, wild cats (lion, cheetah, leopard)
Life cycle: The ruminant intermediate hosts are infected by the ingestion
of oocysts shed into the environment by infected cats. First generation

connective tissue and serosae of the nasal mucosa, larynx, trachea and
other tissues of the intermediate host forming pseudocysts.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, although important tropical and
subtropical countries, especially in Africa
363
Pathogenesis: Following infection in cattle there is a systemic phase
dependent parts of the body.  Subsequently bradyzoites develop in
fibroblasts in the dermis, subcutaneous tissues and fascia and in the nasal
and laryngeal mucosa. The developing cysts in the skin result in a severe
condition characterised by painful subcutaneous swellings and thickenings
of the skin, loss of hair and necrosis. Apart from the clinical
manifestations, which in severe cases can result in death, there can be
considerable economic losses due to condemnation of hides at slaughter
Clinical signs: Affected animals show skin thickening, swelling, hair loss
and skin necrosis. Photophobia, excessive lachrymation and hyperaemia
of the sclera are present, and the cornea is studded with whitish, elevated
specks (pseudocysts)
Diagnosis: Besnoitiosis can be diagnosed by biopsy examination of skin.
The spherical, encapsulated cysts are pathognomonic. The best method is
macroscopically
Pathology: This genus differs from other members of the Sarcocystiidae
in that the cysts containing bradyzoites are found mainly in fibroblasts in
or under the skin. The host cell enlarges and becomes multinucleate as the

Hypoderma spp
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
Description, adults: The adults are large and the abdomen is covered
with yellow-orange hairs giving them a bee-like appearance (Fig. 2.51).
The adults have no functioning mouthparts.
Description, larvae: The mature larvae are thick and somewhat
barrel-shaped, tapering anteriorly. When mature they are 25-30 mm long,
and most segments bear short spines. The colour is dirty white when
newly emerged from the host, but rapidly turns to dark brown; the pupa is

almost black. The third-stage larvae of the two species of Hypoderma that
commonly parasitise cattle (H. bovis and H. lineatum) may be
distinguished from other species of Hypoderma by examination of the
posterior spiracular plate, which is completely surrounded by small spines.
The two Hypoderma species in cattle may be distinguished from each
other by the fact that in H. bovis the posterior spiracular plate surrounding
the button has a narrow funnel-like channel, whereas in H. lineatum it has 
a broad channel (Fig. 2.52)

Hosts: Cattle; the larvae occur erratically in other animals including
equines, sheep and, very rarely, humans.
Life cycle: The adult flies are active only in warm weather, and in the

females attach their eggs to hairs on the lower parts of the body and on the
legs above the hocks. The eggs are 1.0 mm long and are fixed to the hairs
using small terminal clasps (Fig. 2.52). One female may lay 100 or more
18°C.
The first-stage larvae, which are less than 1.0 mm long, hatch in a few
days and crawl down the hairs, penetrate the hair follicles and migrate in
paired mouth hooks and the secretion of proteolytic enzymes aid
migration. The larvae feed as they travel to the species-specific resting

grow to 12-16 mm. [n February and March migration is resumed and the
L2 arrive under the skin of the back. Here they moult to the L3 stage,
which can be palpated as distinct swellings ('warbles'). The L3 makes a
cutaneous perforation and the larvae breathe by applying their spiracles to
the aperture (Fig. 2.53). A fully grown third-stage larva measures 27-28
and fall to the ground, where they pupate under leaves and loose
vegetation for about 5 weeks. The adults then emerge, copulate, the
females lay their eggs and die, all within 1-2 weeks. Oviposition can take
place as soon as 24 hours after emergence from the puparium. The precise
timings and duration of events in the life cycle will vary depending on
latitude and ambient temperature.
Fig. 2.53 Third stage Hypoderma larva in warble on the back of a cow.
367
Geographical distribution: Northern hemisphere. However, Hypoderma
is absent from extreme northern latitudes, including Scandinavia, and it
has occasionally been found sparsely south of the equator in Argentina,
Chile, Peru and southern Africa, following accidental introduction in
imported cattle.
Pathogenesis: By far the most important feature of this genus is the
economic loss caused by downgrading and condemnation of hides
perforated by larvae. The L3 under the skin damage the adjacent flesh and
this necessitates trimming from the carcase the greenish, gelatinous tissue
called *butcher's jelly', also seen in the infested oesophageal submucosal
tissues. In addition the adult flies themselves are responsible for some
loss. When they approach animals to lay their eggs, their characteristic
buzzing noise, which appears to be instantly recognisable, causes the
wire and other obstacles. Dairy cows show reduced milk yield, and beef
animals have reduced weight gains as a result of interrupted feeding. This
species will pursue animals for some distance making repeated attacks.
Clinical signs: Except for poor growth and decreased milk yield in bad
cases the host animals show no appreciable signs until the larvae appear
along the back. The presence of L3 causes characteristic fluid-filled
swellings ('warbles') in the dermis of the back, which can be seen and
felt.
Diagnosis: The presence of the larvae under the skin of the back allows
diagnosis of warble flies. The eggs may also be found on the hairs of the
p  sn aq  sisan oso  a ui s
animals infected with migrating larvae and hence those needing treatment.
368
Pathology: Warble larvae induce a pronounced tissue inflammation. The
cellular reacton is predominantly eosinophilic and lymphocytic. The
presence of the larvae also induces the production of a thickened
connective tissue lined cavity, surrounding the larva, filled with with
inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils. If larvae die in the spinal
canal, the release of a highly toxic proteolysin may cause paraplegia.
Larval death in other regions may, in very rare cases, lead to anaphylaxis
in sensitised animals.
Treatment: Hypoderma is highly susceptible to systemically active
organophosphorus insecticides and to the macrocyclic lactones abamectin,
ivermectin,  doramectin,  eprinomectin
Iand
1moxidectin.The
 organophosphorus preparations are applied as ^pour-ons’ to the backs of
cattle and are absorbed systemically from there; macrocyclic lactones can
be given by subcutaneous injection or pour-on.
Control: In control schemes in Europe, a single annual treatment is
usually recommended, preferably in September, October or November.
This is before the larvae of H. bovis have reached the spinal canal, so that
Treatment in the spring when the larvae have left their resting sites and
arrived under the skin of the back, although effective in control, is less
desirable since the breathing Lg has then perforated the hide. However, in
some countries such as the United Kingdom, such treatment is mandatory
if warbles are present on the backs of cattle.
restriction of cattle movement on  infected farms and compulsory
treatment in the autumn, have been undertaken on islands such as the
United Kingdom and Eire. For example, in the UK the prevalence of
infected cattle was reduced from around 40% in the 1970s to virtually zero
in the 1990s. However, evidence of infection is still encountered

Hypodermabovis
Common name: Warble fly, northern cattle grub
Predilection site: Subcutaneous tissues, spinal canal
Description: Adult female Hypoderma bovis are about 15 mm in length
and bee-like in appearance; the abdomen is covered with yellow-orange
hairs with a broad band of black hairs around the middle (Fig. 2.54a). The
hairs on the head and the anterior part of the thorax are greenish yellow.
Life cycle: Characteristic features of the life cycle of H. bovis are that it
attaches its eggs singly to hairs on the lower parts of the body (Fig. 2.52c).
Following penetration through the skin the larvae migrate along nerves
until they reach the epidural fat of the spine in the region of the thoracic
and lumber vertebrae,where they overwinter

Description: Adult female Hypoderma fineatum are about 13 mm in
yellow-orange hairs with a broad band of black hairs around the middle.
The hairs on the head and the anterior part of the thorax are yellowish
white (Fig. 2.54b).
Life cycle: Characteristic features of the life cycle of H. fineatum are that
it attaches its eggs in rows of six or more on individual hairs below the
hocks (Fig. 2.52b). Following penetration of the skin, the larvae migrate
between the fascial planes of muscles and along connective tissue,
towards the region of the diaphragm. Eventually they reach the submucosa
of the oesophagus where they spend the winter. Adult H. lineatum also
usually emerge about 1 month before H. bovis.
reaches the animals by a series of hops along the ground and remains on
the lower limb for a time while it lays its row of eggs, so that the animal
may be unaware of its presence. Consequently, in parts of the USA this
species is appropriately termed the “heel fly'. If larvae of H. lineatum die
in the oesophageal wall they may cause bloat through oesophageal

stricture and faulty regurgitation. Larval death in other regions may, in
very rare cases, lead to anaphylaxis in sensitised animals.
ECTOPARASITES
FLIES
The larval stages, 'maggots', of a number of species of fly (Diptera) are
found in skin wounds on cattle and are listed in the host-parasite checklist
at the end of this chapter. More detailed descriptions of these parasites are
found in Chapter 1l (Facultative ectoparasites and arthropod vectors).
LICE
Heavy louse infestation is known as pediculosis. Blood-sucking lice have
been implicated in the transmission of disease such as those that transmit
rickettsial anaplasmosis; however, lice are predominantly of importance
because of the direct damage they cause. This effect is usually a function
of their density. A small number of lice may be very common and present
no problem. However, louse populations can increase dramatically

infestations from dirty housing is limited, although it cannot be ignored.
Occasionally, lice also may be transferred between animals by attachment
to flies (phoresy).
Description: Lice have a segmented body divided into a head, thorax and
abdomen. They have three pairs of jointed legs and a pair of short
antennae. All lice are dorsoventrally flattened and wingless. The sensory
organs are poorly developed; the eyes are vestigial or absent.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, primarily in cooler areas
Pathogenesis: Light infestations are usually only discovered accidentally
and should not be considered of any pathogenic importance, lice being
almost normal inhabitants of the dermis and coat of many cattle,
372
especially in winter. Moderate infestations are associated only with a mild
chronic dermatitis, and are well tolerated. [n heavier infestations there is
pruritus, with rubbing and licking, but if sucking lice are present in large
numbers there may be anaemia and weakness.
Clinical signs: Light infestations are usually only discovered accidentally.
In these infections the lice and eggs are easily found by parting the hair,
especially along the back, the lice being next to the skin and the eggs

lice undisturbed. In such animals the shedding of the winter coat may be
delayed for many weeks, retaining large numbers of lice.
Diagnosis: The lice may be seen on the skin. Removal and examination
under a light microscope will allow species identification. The eggs are
also visible and appear as white specks attached to the hairs.
Epidemiology: In warm countries there is no marked seasonality of
infestations are in late winter and early spring, when the coat is at its
         
multiplication. The most rapid annual increase in louse populations is seen
when cattle are winter-housed, and lice can build up in numbers very
quickly. In late spring, there is usually an abrupt fall in the numbers of
lice, most of the parasites and eggs being shed with the winter coat.
Numbers generally remain low throughout the summer, partly because the
thinness of the coat provides a restricted habitat, but partly also because
high skin surface temperatures and direct sunlight limit multiplication and
may even be lethal.
Treatment:
Ihe
Organophosphorus

insecticides (for example
chlorfenvinphos, coumaphos, chlorpyrifos, crotoxyphos, trichlorfon,
phosmet and propetamphos), usually applied as pour-on or spot-on
applications, are effective in killing all lice. However, most insecticides
registered for use on cattle are not very active against louse eggs. This
means that after treatment eggs can still hatch and continue the infestation.
A second treatment is therefore recommended 2 weeks later to kill newly
emerged lice. Pour-on or spot-on synthetic pyrethroids, such as

Control: The timing and frequency of treatments depends very much on
individual circumstances. In many cases treatment in late autumn or early
winter will give adequate control of cattle lice. In Europe, louse control is
usually undertaken when cattle are housed for the winter. Because a wide
variety of chemical classes are effective, louse control is not difficult to
achieve. Nevertheless, in an attempt to reduce the risk of selection for
resistance, rotation of chemical classes may be advantageous. Treatment
of all stock on farm and subsequent initial quarantine and treatment of all
newly introduced animals will allow a good degree of louse control to be
maintained.
Bovicola bovis
Synonym:Damalinia bovis
Common name: Red louse, cattle chewing louse
Predilection site: Favours the top of the head, especially the curly hair of
the poll and forehead, the neck, shoulders, back, and rump, and
occasionally the tail switch.
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Ischnocera
Family: Trichodectidae
Description: B. bovis are a reddish brown in colour with dark transverse
pu ul ui w z on dn ans snv uaop an uo sug
0.35-0.55 mm in width. The head is relatively large, as wide as the body
and is rounded anteriorly (Fig. 2.55). The mouthparts are ventral and are
adapted for chewing. The legs are slender and are adapted for moving
amongst the hair. The claws, on each leg, are small.
Hosts: Cattle
Life cycle: During a life span of about a month the female lays an egg
every 2 days on average. These eggs are usually whitish, and are glued
374
singly to the hair shaft where they may be seen with the naked eye. The
eggs hatch after 7-10 days and each nymphal instar lasts 5-6 days. The
nymphs have lighter sclerotisation and less distinct banding than adult
lice. The nymph is similar in appearance though much smaller than the
adult. After three nymphal stages, the nymph moults again to become an
adult. The whole cycle from egg to adult takes 2-3 weeks. Adults may
live for up to 10 weeks. Bovicola are believed to be capable of increasing
their rate of population growth by changing from sexual to asexual
reproduction via parthenogenesis. As a result, highly female biased sex
ratios may be commonly found in a growing population.

1944).
Pathogenesis: The mouthparts of B. bovis are equipped for biting and

scales and blood scabs. If infestations increase, the lice may spread down
the sides and may cover the rest of the body. This louse feeds by scraping
375
away scurf and skin debris from the base of the hairs, causing
considerable irritation to the host animal. The skin reaction can cause the
hair to loosen and the cattle react to the irritation by rubbing or scratching,
which will result in patches of hair being pulled or rubbed off. Scratching
may produce wounds or bruises and a roughness to the skin. This may

Epidemiology: Bovicola bovis is one of the commonest cattle parasites in
Europe and it is the only chewing louse found on cattle in the USA.
Though it causes less individual damage than sucking lice, it is present in
larger numbers and so can be extremely damaging. Infested cattle may
show disrupted feeding patterns.

Haematopinuseurysternus
Common name: The short-nosed louse
Predilection site: Skin, poll and at the base of the horns, in the ears, and
around the eyes and nostrils and even in mild infestations it is found in the
tail switch.
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Anoplura
Family: Haematopinidae
domestic mammals, measuring 3.4-4.8 mm in length. The louse is broad
in shape with a short, pointed head (Fig. 2.56). The head and thorax are
yellow or greyish brown, and the abdomen blue-grey with a dark stripe on
each side. The hard-shelled eggs are opaque and white and are pointed at
their base.
Hosts: Cattle
Life cycle: Adult lice live for 10-15 days and, when mature, females lay
            
hairs or bristles of the host and hatch in 1-2 weeks. The emerging nymphs
resemble the adult louse except in size. Nymphs moult to become adults
about 14 days after hatching. The female lice begin to lay eggs after
feeding and mating.

377
Pathogenesis: In severe infestations, the entire region from the base of the
horns, over the face (Fig. 2.57) to the base of the tail can be infested.
Notes: This species is more commonly found infesting mature cattle than
young animals. In North America Haematopinus eurysternus is more
 prevalent in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions.
Haematopinus quadripertusus
Common name: Tail louse
Predilection site: Tail and perineum
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Anoplura
Family: Haematopinidae
Description: Haematopinus quadripertusus is a large, eyeless louse about
4-5 mm in length. It has a dark, well developed thoracic sternal plate.
Behind the antennae are prominent angular processes, known as ocular
points or temporal angles. The legs are of similar sizes, each terminating
in a single large claw that opposes the tibial spur. Distinct sclerotised
paratergal plates are visible on abdominal segments 2 or 3 to 8.
378
Hosts: Cattle, commonly zebu cattle (Bos indicus)
Life cycle: During a lifespan of about a month the female lays 50-100
operculate eggs ('nits') at a rate of one to six eggs per day. These are
usually whitish, and are glued to the hair or feathers where they may be
seen with the naked eye. The eggs of this louse are usually deposited on
the tail hairs, which become matted with eggs in severe infestations. In
very severe cases the tail head may be shed. The eggs hatch after 9-25
days depending on the climatic conditions. Nymphs disperse over the
entire body surface of the host, but adults are most commonly found on
the tail head. After three nymphal moults, over a period of about 12 days.
the fully mature reproductive adult is present. Within 4 days, after feeding
and mating, the adult female begins to lay eggs. The whole cycle from egg
to adult takes 2-3 weeks. This species is most commonly found among the
long tail hairs at the base of the tail.
Pathogenesis: Haematopinus quadripertusus feeds on host blood using its
piercing mouthparts. In severe infestations, the entire region from the base
Epidemiology: Unlike other cattle lice, Haematopinus quadripertusus is
most abundant during the summer and in warmer climates. The lice are
transmitted through direct contact between hosts.
Linognathus vituli
Common name: 'Long-nosed’ cattle louse
Predilection site: Skin, preferring the head, neck and dewlap
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Anoplura
Family: Linognathidae
Description: Bluish black medium-sized louse with an elongated, pointed
head and body, approximately 2.5 mm in length (Fig. 2.58). There are no
eyes or ocular points. Forelegs are small. Mid- and hindlegs are larger
with a large claw and tibial spur. There are two rows of setae on each
segment. The thoracic sternal plate is weakly developed or absent. The
379
eggs may be dark in colour, and are less easy to see on hair. These lice are
gregarious in habit, forming dense, isolated clusters. While feeding they
ex tend their bodies in an upright position.
Hosts: Cattle
Life cycle: During a lifespan of about a month the female lays a number
of operculate eggs at a rate of about one egg per day. These are glued to
    u a  s    a  
within 10-15 days. The nymph is similar in appearance to the adult
though much smaller. The nymph increases in size as it moults through
three instars, to eventually become an adult. The whole cycle from egg to
adult takes 2-3 weeks.
Pathogenesis: This  species is  capable of transmitting bovine
anaplasmosis, dermatomycosis (ringworm) and theileriosis.

Séguy, 1944).
380
Epidemiology: Heaviest infestation occurs in late winter and early spring.
Solenopotes capillatus
Common name: Little blue cattle louse
Predilection site: Skin of neck, head, shoulders, dewlap, back and tail
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Anoplura
Family: Linognathidae
Description: Small bluish lice which tend to occur in clusters on the neck,
head, shoulders, dewlap, back and tail. These lice may be distinguished
from the genus Linognathus by the presence of abdominal spiracles set on
381
slightly sclerotised tubercles, which project slightly from each abdominal
segment (Fig. 2.59). At 1.2-1.5 mm in length Solenopotes capillatus is the
smallest of the anopluran lice found on cattle. Eyes and ocular points are
absent, and the louse has a short rostrum. There are no paratergal plates on
the abdomen. The second and third pairs of legs are larger than the first
thoracic sternal plate is distinct. The eggs of this louse species are small,
short and dark blue.

MITES
The ectoparasitic mites of cattle feed on blood, lymph, skin debris or
sebaceous secretions, which they ingest by puncturing the skin, scavenge
from the skin surface or imbibe from epidermal lesions. Most ectoparasitic
mites spend their entire lives in intimate contact with their host, so that
transmission from host to host is primarily by physical contact. Infestation
by mites is called acariasis and can result in severe dermatitis, known as
mange, which may cause significant welfare problems and economic
losses.
Demodex bovis
Predilection site: Hair follicles and sebaceous glands
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
383
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Demodicidae
Description: Species of Demodex have an elongate tapering body, up to
0.1-0.4 mm in length, with four pairs of stumpy legs ending in small blunt
The legs are located at the front of the body, and as such the striated
Opisthosoma forms at least half the body length.
Hosts:Cattle
Life cycle: Demodex spp usually live as commensals in the skin, and are
highly site-specific, occupying the hair follicles and sebaceous glands.
hexapod larvae, in which each short leg ends in a single, three-pronged
claw. Unusually, a second hexapod larval stage follows, in which each leg
ends in a pair of three-pronged claws. Octopod protonymph, tritonymph
and adult stages then follow. Immature stages and these migrate more
deeply into the dermis. One follicle may harbour all life cycle stages
concurrently. The life cycle is completed in 18-24 days. In each follicle or
gland the mites may occur in large numbers, located in a characteristic
head-downward posture. In the newborn and very young these sites are

and several thousand mites, which cause hide damage and economic loss.
Though these nodules can be easily seen in smooth-coated animals, they
are often undetected in rough-coated cattle until the hide has been dressed

particularly on the withers, lateral neck, back and flanks. Concurrent
pyoderma may occur, leading to furunculosis with ulceration and crust
formation.
Diagnosis: For confirmatory diagnosis, deep scrapings are necessary to
reach the mites deep in the follicles and glands. This is best achieved by
taking a fold of skin, applying a drop of liquid paraffin, and scraping until
capillary blood appears.
Pathology: In cattle cutaneous nodules consist of follicular cysts lined

mites. Eruption of the cysts on to the skin may form a thick crust; rupture
within the dermis may form an abcess or granulomatous reaction.
Epidemiology: Probably because of its location deep in the dermis, it is
prolonged contact. Such contact usually only occurs during suckling, and
as such it is thought that most infections are acquired in the early weeks of
life. The muzzle, neck, withers and back are common sites of infestation.
Treatment: In many cases demodecosis spontaneously resolves and
treatment is unnecessary. The organophosphate trichlophon, used on three

effective.
Control: Control is rarely applied since there is little incentive for farmers
to treat their animals, as the cost of damage is borne by the hide merchant.
Notes: Species of the genus Demodex are highly specialised mites that
live in the hair follicles and sebaceous glands of a wide range of wild and
domestic animals, including humans. They are believed to form a group of
hosts: Demodex phylloides (pig), Demodex canis (dog), Demodex bovis
(cattle), Demodex equi (horse), Demodex musculi (mouse), Demodex ratti
(rat), Demodex caviae (guinea-pig), Demodex cati (cat) and Demodex
folliculorum andDemodexbrevis onhumans.
In some parts of Australia 95% of hides are damaged, and surveys in the
USA have shown a quarter of the hides to be affected. In Britain 17% of
hides have been found to have Demodex nodules.

Psorergates bovis
Synonym:Psorergates bos
Common name: Cattle itch mite
Predilection site: Skin, all over the body
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Psorergatidae
Description: Psorergates bovis is a small mite, roughly circular in form
     s     o  sal 
equidistantly around the body circumference, giving the mite a crude star
progressively longer during the nymphal stages until, in the adult, the legs
are well developed and the mites become mobile. Adults are about 190 μm
long and 160 μm wide. The tarsal claws are simple and the empodium is
pad-like. The femur of each leg bears a large, inwardly directed curved
spine. In the adult female, two pairs of long, whip-like setae are present
 posteriorly; in the male there is only a single pair.
Hosts: Cattle
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, hexapod larva, followed by
octopod protonymph, tritonymph and adult. All developmental stages

Geographical distribution: Australia, New Zealand, southern Africa,
North and South America. It has not been reported in Europe.
Pathogenesis: Little or no pathogenic effect.
Clinical signs: There are few clinical signs associated with infestations of
this mite. Mites may occur on apparently normal skin without causing
itching of the host animal.
386
Diagnosis: To obtain mites it is necessary, having clipped away a patch of
hair, to apply a drop of mineral oil and scrape the skin down to the blood
capillary level. The mites themselves are easily identified.
Pathology: Rarely the mite may cause alopecia and desquamation, but in
the majority of cases there appears to be no recognisable lesion associated
with the infection.
Epidemiology: This mite is not normally considered to be of clinical
significance.

secondary bacterial infections are common in severe cases. Death in
untreated calves, weight loss, decreased milk production and increased
susceptibility to other diseases can occur.
387
Treatment: In cattle dipping and topical application of nonsystemic
acaricides, such as the organophosphates (diazinon, coumaphos or
phosmet), amitraz or a lime-sulphur dip, may be effective. Dippings
should be repeated at  2-week intervals. The topical application of
flumethrin is also used in some parts of the world. Most treatments are not
licensed for use in dairy cattle. Injectable formulations of avermectins
(ivermectin and doramectin) and milbemycins (moxidectin) may be
effective, though the isolation of treated animals for 2-3 weeks after
a pour-on formulation, and is the only macrocyclic lactone that may be
used in dairy cattle.
Following diagnosis, the treatment of all animals on infected premises and
subsequent treatment of all incoming stock is recommended

Predilection site: Skin; particularly the legs, feet, base of tail and upper
rear surface of the udder
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Psoroptidae
Description: Very similar to P. ovis but it is believed that P. natalensis
can be distinguished morphologically by the length and spatulate shape of
the fourth outer opisthosomal seta of the male. However, the precise
species status of P. natalensis has yet to be confirmed.
Hosts: Primarily buffalo but it has been reported on cattle.

Chorioptes bovis
Synonym: Chorioptes ovis, Chorioptes equi, Chorioptes caprae,
Chorioptes cuniculi
Predilection site: Skin, particularly the legs, feet, base of tail and upper
rear surface of the udder
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Psoroptidae
Description: Adult female Chorioptes bovis are about 300 μm in length
(Fig. 2.60), considerably smaller than Psoroptes ovis. Chorioptes do not
have jointed pretarsi; their pretarsi are shorter than in Psoroptes and the
sucker-like pulvillus is more cup-shaped, as opposed to trumpet-shaped in
Psoroptes. In the adult female, tarsi I, II and IV have short-stalked pretarsi
and tarsi IIl have a pair of long, terminal, whip-like setae. The first and
second pairs of legs are stronger than the others and the fourth pair has
long, slender tarsi. In the male, all legs possess short-stalked pretarsi and
pulvilli. However, the fourth pair is extremely short, not extending beyond
the body margin. Male C. bovis have two broad, flat setae and three
normal setae on well developed posterior lobes. The mouthparts are
distinctly rounder, and the abdominal tubercles of the male are noticeably
more truncate than those of Psoroptes (see Fig. 3.44).
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, horse, goat, rabbit

(b)
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, hexapod larva, followed by
octopod protonymph, tritonymph and adult. All developmental stages
occur on the host. The complete egg-to-adult life cycle takes about 3
weeks. Eggs are deposited at a rate of one per day and are attached to the
host skin. Adult females produce 15-20 eggs and live for 2-3 weeks.
Chorioptes bovis has mouthparts which are adapted for chewing skin
debris. Mites may survive for up to 3 weeks off the host, allowing
transmission from housing and bedding as well as by direct contact.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: In catle, chorioptic mange occurs most often in housed
animals, particularly dairy animals, affecting mainly the neck, tail-head,
udder and legs. Usually only a few animals in a group are clinically
affected. The mites are found more commonly on the hindleg than on the
foreleg. It is a mild condition, and lesions tend to remain localised, with
slow spread. Its importance is economic; the pruritus caused by the mites

Epidemiology: Mite populations are highest in the winter and may regress
against Chorioptes. They should be repeated at 2-week intervals.
[vermectin, doramectin, eprinomectin and moxidectin applied topically as
a pour-on are also effective against chorioptic mange.
Control: Regular checks of livestock and quarantining of infected animals
will help to control the frequency and extent of infestations.

Sarcoptes scabiei
Common name: Scabies
Predilection site: Skin
391
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Sarcoptidae
Pathogenesis: Sarcoptic mange is potentially the most severe of the cattle
manges, although many cases are mild. Nevertheless, it is being
increasingly diagnosed in Britain and in some areas, including Canada and
parts of the USA, the disease is notifiable and the entry of cattle carrying
Sarcoptes, whether clinically affected or not, is not permitted. The mite
has partial site preferences, which have given it, in the USA, the common
name of *neck and tail mange', but it may occur on any part of the body.
Mild infections merely show scaly skin with little hair loss, but in severe
cases the skin becomes thickened, there is marked loss of hair and crusts
form on the less well haired parts of the body (Fig. 2.61), such as the
escutcheon of cows. There is intense pruritus leading to loss of meat and
milk production and to hides being downgraded because of damage by
scratching and rubbing.
Treatment and control: Treatment has largely depended on the use of
repeated washes or sprays usually organochlorine insecticides such as
gamma HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane). However, organochlorine
insecticides are not now available in most countries. Systemic macrocyclic
lactones may give good results. Alternatively, the application of a pour-on
organophosphate such as phosmet, on two occasions at an interval of 14
days, is also effective. Neither macrocyclic lactones nor phosmet are
licensed for use in lactating animals whose milk is used for human
consumption. The amidine, amitraz, is effective against sarcoptic mange
in cattle and has withdrawal periods of 24 and 48 hours respectively for
meat and milk.

Parasites of sheep and goats
ENDOPARASITES
PARASITESOF THE DIGESTIVE
SYSTEM
OESOPHAGUS
Gongylonema pulchrum
Synonym: Gongylonema scutatum
Common name: Gullet worm
Predilection site: Oesophagus, rumen
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: A long, slender whitish worm; the males being about
5.0 cm and the females up to about 14.0 cm in length.
Description,   microscopic:   Worms   are   easily    distinguished
the anterior region of the body. Asymmetrical cervical alae are prominent
398
The egg is thin-shelled and possesses two opercula. It contains an L1 when
passed in faeces.
Final host: Sheep, goat, cattle, pig, buffalo, horse, donkey, deer, camel,
man
Intermediate host: Coprophagous beetles, cockroaches
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically spiruroid. Eggs are passed in faeces
and when eaten by an intermediate host they hatch and develop to the
infective stage within about 4 weeks. Infection of the definitive host is
through the ingestion of infected coprophagous beetles or cockroaches.
The adult worms live spirally (in a zipper fashion) embedded in the
oesophageal mucosa or submucosa with their anterior and/or posterior
Geographical distribution: Probably worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infection is usually regarded as non-pathogenic, though
infection has been associated with a mild chronic oesophagitis in
ruminants. G. puichrum in humans presents as a painful tumour-like area
in the oral epithelium or subcutaneous tissues that contains coiled worms.
Clinical signs: Usually asymptomatic in ruminants
Diagnosis: Usually an incidental finding on postmortem
Pathology: Adult worms bury in the epithelium of the forestomachs
producing white or red, blood-filled zigzag tracts in the mucosa.
Epidemiology: Infection is very much dependent on the presence and
abundance of the intermediate hosts, principally coprophagous beetles of
the genera Aphodius, Onthophagus, Blaps, Caccobius, Onthophagus. Man
can acquire infection through direct ingestion of the intermediate host
cockroaches in the water source.
Treatment: Not reported
Control: Control is not practical, nor necessary

Hosts: Sheep, goat
Life cycle: Both the free-living and parasitic phases of the life cycle are
similar to those of the bovine species, O. ostertagi.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide

Pathogenesis: [n clinical infections, this resembles the situation in cattle
and similar lesions are present at necropsy, although the morocco leather
appearance of the abomasal surface seen in cattle is not common in sheep
experimental and natural conditions that T. circumcincta causes a marked
depression in appetite and this, together with losses of plasma protein into
the gastrointestinal tract and sloughed intestinal epithelium, results in
moderate infections of T. circumcincta carcase evaluation can show poor
 protein and fat deposition. Skeletal growth can also be impaired.
Diarrhoea is intermittent and although stained hindquarters are common.
seen.
Diagnosis: This is based on clinical signs, seasonality of infection and
faecal egg counts and, if possible, postmortem examination, when the
characteristic lesions can be seen in the abomasum. Plasma pepsinogen
levels are above the normal of about 0.8 [U tyrosine and usually exceed
2.0 tU in sheep with heavy infections.
Pathology: The pathology is similar to that described for O. ostertagi in
cattle. The developing parasites cause distension of parasitised gastric
glands, leading to a thickened hyperplastic gastric mucosa similar to that
seen in cattle (see Fig. 2.5). In heavy infections these nodules coalesce and
the abomasal folds are often very oedematous and hyperaemic.
Epidemiology: In sheep, T. circumcincta and O. trifurcata are responsible
October; thereafter arrested development of many ingested larvae occurs
and a type [I syndrome has been occasionally reported in late winter and
early spring, especially in young adults. In subtropical areas with winter
rainfall outbreaks of disease occurs primarily in late winter.
Temperate regions
In Europe, the herbage numbers of T. circumcincta L3 increase markedly
from mid-summer onwards and this is when most disease appears. These
larvae are derived mainly from eggs passed in the faeces of ewes during
404
the periparturient period, from about 2 weeks prior to lambing until about
6 weeks post-lambing. Eggs passed by lambs, from worm burdens which
have accrued from the ingestion of overwintered larvae, also contribute to
      n    
dangerous populations of L3 from July to October. If ingested prior to
October, the majority of these larvae mature in 3 weeks; thereafter, many
become arrested in development for several months and may precipitate
type II disease when they mature.
[mmunity is acquired slowly and usually requires exposure over two
grazing seasons before a significant resistance to infection develops.
Subsequently, adult ewes harbour only very low populations of
Subtropical regions
The epidemiology in subtropical areas is basically similar to that in
temperate zones, except that the seasonal timing of events is different. In
        i  s  o 
pasture, which occurs with the onset of rain in late autumn or winter. This
coincides with conditions which are favourable to the development of the
free-living stages of Teladorsagia and so infective larvae accumulate
during the winter to cause clinical problems or production loss in the
second half of the winter; arrested larval development occurs at the end of
the winter or early spring. The sources of pasture contamination are again
 jo   s a  d a  s 
which have survived the summer. The relative importance of these sources
in any country varies according to the conditions during the adverse
longevity of L3 is reduced, except in areas with shade and these can act as
reservoirs of infection until the following winter. Although L3 can persist
 probably less than that afforded by the more abundant bovine faecal pat.
Ostertagia trifurcata
[n temperate regions this is similar to T. circumcincta. In tropical and
subtropical zones where the summer is very dry and hot, the longevity of
405
L3 is reduced except in areas with shade and these can act as reservoirs of
infection until the following winter. Although L3 can persist in sheep
faeces during adverse weather conditions the protection is probably less
rainfall areas the numbers of Ostertagia and Teladorsagia larvae on
pasture reach a maximum in late winter and decline markedly through
spring into summer as the pastures dry out.
Treatment: Ovine teladorsagiosis often responds well to treatment with
any of the modern benzimidazoles or pro-benzimidazoles, levamisole.
which in sheep is effective against arrested larvae, or the avermectins/
milbemycins. However, the widespread prevalence of isolates of
Teladorsagia circumcincta that are resistant to the benzimidazoles, and
increasingly resistant to levamisole and even some macrocyclic lactones,
dictates that farmers must monitor the resistance status of their flocks to
ensure that an effective anthelmintic is used. Treated lambs should
preferably be moved to safe pasture and, if this is not possible, treatment
may have to be repeated at 6-weekly intervals until the pasture larval
levels decrease in late autumn.
Many of the anthelmintics recommended for sheep are not registered for
use in goats. Where goat milk or milk products are used for human
consumption, milk-withholding periods for different drugs should be
observed. Thiabendazole has anti-fungal properties and should not be used
when milk is processed for cheese.
Control: See The treatment and control of parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE)
in sheep (below)
Notes: Considered to be a polymorphic species with at least two male
morphs, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Ostertagia trifurcata, and
possibly a third, Teladorsagia davtiani. The females cannot be
differentiated but are distinguishable from other ostertagian females.
The treatment and control ofparasitic
gastroenteritis (PGE) in sheep
The recommendations outlined below are applicable to temperate areas of
the northern hemisphere, but the principles can be adapted to local
conditions in other regions.
406
Treatment
Because of the short period between birth and marketing, the treatment of
PGE in lambs is an inferior policy compared with the preventive measures
discussed below. However, when necessary, treatment with any of the
benzimidazoles, levamisole or an avermectin/milbemycin will remove
adult worms and developing stages, unless resistance to these drugs is
present in the flock. Following treatment, lambs should be moved to
pasture not grazed by sheep that year, otherwise they will immediately
become reinfected. The occasional outbreaks of type [I teladorsagiosis
(ostertagiosis) in young adult sheep in the spring may be treated with the
same anthelmintics. Unlike O. ostertagi in calves, the arrested stages of
the common sheep nematodes are susceptible to the benzimidazoles and
levamisole.
Control
that described for O. ostertagi in cattle, its practice is somewhat different
for the following reasons:
1. The PPR (periparturient rise in faecal egg counts) is very marked
in ewes and is the most important cause of pasture contamination
with nematode eggs in the spring.
2. PGE in sheep is generally associated with a variety of nematode
genera with differing epidemiological characteristics.
3. Most sheep graze throughout their lives so that pasture
contamination with nematode eggs and the intake of infective larvae
is almost continuous and modified only by climatic restrictions.
4. Anthelmintic resistance is now widespread throughout many
sheep-rearing areas of the world and therefore strategies are
development of resistant isolates. Recently, guidelines for the use of
anthelmintics in sustainable control strategies for sheep in northern
temperate areas have been produced (www.nationalsheep.org) and
are outlined below.
407
Summary of guidelines for the control of
gastrointestinal
nematodes
and
use
of
anthelmintics in sheep and goats
Anthelmintic usage
1. Use anthelmintics sparingly. This will reduce the selection
pressure for further development of drug resistance. Effective
monitoring of faecal egg counts is integral to this approach. This
strategy is discussed more fully under treatment of ewes and lambs.
2. Use anthelmintics effectively. It is important regularly to check
the dosing equipment and to apply correct techniques to maximise
the efficacy of the drug. Sheep should be dosed at the rate
likelihood of under-dosing.
3. Monitor for anthelmintic resistance. It is essential to ensure
that the drug to be administered will be effective. The resistance
status of each family of anthelmintic should be assessed on the
farm.
4. Use the appropriate anthelmintic. In some situations it may be
closantel against a specific infection dominated by Haemonchus or
a benzimidazole against Nematodirus. Avoidance of using a
broad-spectrum  drug  in  these  circumstances  will  reduce  the
selection pressure to this family of anthelmintics. Annual rotation of
anthelmintic families can be useful, especially where resistance to
the macrocyclic lactones is absent or at a very low level. This
 i       s
firmly established.
Control strategies
1. Use effective quarantine procedures. It is essential to treat
prevent the introduction of anthelmintic-resistant worms. This may
be difficult on farms with resistance to all three families of drugs,
although a narrow-spectrum product may be useful in some
circumstances. In many northern temperate areas resistance is
408
mainly to the benzimidazoles with some resistance to levamisole
and emerging resistance to the macrocyclic lactones. In these
circumstances a quarantine treatment would consist of treatment
sequentially, or if available, as a combination product.
2. Use strategies to conserve susceptible worms. The aim is to
lower the selection pressure for development of resistance which
contamination or when immune animals are treated. Two
approaches are appropriate. Firstly, do not move treated sheep
immediately on to low contamination pasture as any worms which
 go sq  q  a ou m  aa
susceptible parasites. Instead, delay moving the sheep from
contaminated pasture after dosing to allow them to become lightly
   o     
Secondly, leave a proportion (about 10%) of the flock untreated so
that some animals will shed eggs on to the low-contamination
        
reduce selection for resistance versus some loss of productivity.
3.Use strategies that reduce the reliance on anthelmintics.
Approaches which integrate grazing management will reduce the
exposure to infective larvae, and thus reduce the adverse effects of
infection on productivity, whilst allowing sufficient exposure to
induce a measure of acquired immunity. This strategy is considered
in more detail below.
In selecting the best method of prophylaxis much depends on whether the
farm consists primarily of permanent pasture or has pastures which are
rotated with crops so that new leys or hay and silage aftermaths are
available each year.
Prophylaxis  on farms
consisting of mainly
permanent pasture
On such farms control may be obtained either by anthelmintic prophylaxis
or by alternate grazing on an annual basis with cattle and sheep. The
former is the only feasible method where the farm stock is primarily sheep
409
while the latter can be used where cattle and sheep are both present in
reasonable proportions.
Prophylaxis by anthelmintics
Intensive chemoprophylaxis is not a long-term option for the sustainable
control of ovine and caprine PGE
condition will be carrying low worm burdens as they will have a
strong aquired immunity. Treatment at this period can significantly
select for anthelmintic resistance. It is therefore recommended that
only mature ewes with a low body condition score or immature
effective against arrested larval stages.
2. Adult sheep at lambing. The most important source of infection
for the lamb crop is undoubtedly the increase in nematode eggs in
ewe faeces during the PPR and prophylaxis will only be efficient if
this is kept to a minimum. Effective anthelmintic therapy of ewes
during the fourth month of pregnancy should eliminate most of the
worm burdens present at this time, including arrested larval stages
and in the case of ewes on extensive grazing, where nutritional
status is frequently low, this treatment often results in improved
general body condition. Treatment around lambing or turnout, and
again 45 weeks later will significantly reduce the ewe contribution
to pasture contamination, but it may also increase the selection for
Suggested that ewes are dosed early in the lactation period to allow
them to become reinfected before a high level of immunity is
re-established. In addition, leaving a proportion of the ewes
untreated will allow the pasture to be contaminated with unselected
parasites. Both of these approaches could however increase the risk
of disease in the lamb crop later in the season. Where ewes are
inwintered or housed for a period before lambing, dose them on
entry to the shed. Following turnout on to contaminated pasture
they may require further treatment in about 45 weeks. An
provide anthelmintic incorporated in a feed or energy block during
the periparturient period. The results obtained with the latter system
appear to be best when the ewes are contained in small paddocks or
410
fields, as the uptake of drug is less consistent under extensive
grazing systems.Rumen boluses designed for the slow release of
anthelmintics over a prolonged period are available in some
countries for sheep and are recommended for use in ewes during the
periparturient period to eliminate worm egg output. Young adults
and rams should also be treated at these times.
3.Lambs.Treatment for N. battus infection is considered
separately under the relevant section. In general, lambs should be
treated at weaning, and where possible moved to 'safe' pastures, i.e.
those not grazed by sheep since the previous year. Where such
grazing is not available, prophylactic treatments (using either
levamisole, benzimidazoles, pro-benzimidazoles or avermectins/
milbemycins) should be repeated until autumn or marketing. The
number of treatments will vary depending on the stocking rate, one
        o 
intensive conditions. In order to reduce unnecessary dosing of
lambs it is recommended that faecal egg counts are monitored to
blocks have proved useful.
The prophylactic programmes outlined above are relatively costly in terms
of drugs and labour but are currently the only practicable options available
where the enterprise is heavily dependent on one animal species.
Prophylaxis by alternate grazing of sheep and cattle
On farms where sheep and cattle are both present in significant numbers,
effective control is theoretically possible by alternating the grazing of
pasture on an annual basis with each host, due to the relative
insusceptibility of cattle to sheep nematodes and vice versa. However,
Nematodirus battus can infect young susceptible calves and this may
    t    
season's lambs. In practice, control is best achieved by exchanging, in the
spring, pastures grazed by sheep and beef cattle over the previous year,
preferably combined with anthelmintic treatment at the time of exchange.
411
Prophylaxis on farms with alternative grazing
[n these mostly intensive farms, rotation of crops and grass is often a
feature, and therefore new leys and hay and silage aftermaths are available
       o   
management and anthelmintic prophylaxis.
1. Prophylaxis by grazing management and anthelmintics. Good
control is possible with only one annual anthelmintic treatment of
PPR in faecal egg counts prior to moving the ewes and lambs to a
safe pasture. At weaning, the lambs should be moved to another
safe pasture and an anthelmintic treatment of the lambs at this time
is good policy. A second system has been devised for farms where
arable crops, sheep and cattle are major components and involves a
3-year rotation of cattle, sheep and crops. With this system the
aftermath grazing available after cropping may be used for weaned
calves and weaned lambs. It has been suggested that anthelmintic
prophylaxis can be disposed of completely under this system, but
omitted. As anthelmintics may not remove all the worms present
and some cattle nematodes can infect sheep and vice versa, and a
few infective larvae on the pasture can survive for beyond 2 years,
it is advisable to give at least one annual spring treatment to all
stock prior to moving to new pastures.
2. Prophylaxis by grazing management alone. Systems using
strip or creep grazing, which limit the return of sheep to pastures
until the contamination has declined to a low level, have been used

system where sheep are rapidly rotated through a series of paddocks
Sheep only graze a paddock for 3%2 to 4 days and are then moved to

interval of less than 5 weeks. Under the hot humid environment the

Marshallagia marshalli
Synonym: Ostertagia marshalli, Ostertagia tricuspis
Predilection site: Abomasum
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: Similar to Ostertagia spp and can be differentiated by
its greater length (males 10-13 mm; females 15-20 mm).
Description, microscopic: Males have a long thin dorsal ray, which
bifurcates near the posterior extremity. The end of the spicule is divided
into three small processes. The ellipsoidal eggs are much larger than
Ostertagia spp (>150 μm) and resemble those of Nematodirus battus.
Hosts: Sheep, goats, deer and wild small ruminants
Life cycle: The life cycle is similar to Ostertagia except that L2 can hatch
from the egg. Following ingestion, larvae burrow into the abomasal
mucosa and form small greyish white nodules, which may contain several
developing parasites. The young Ls emerge from the nodules around day
16 post-infection and egg laying is usually apparent by 3 weeks. Arrested
development of larvae can occur.

southern Europe, USA, South America, India and Russia.
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Generally M. marshalli is not
considered to be an important pathogen.
Diagnosis: Adults are readily identified based on the structure of the male
spicules. Eggs are recognised in faecal samples by their large size.
Epidemiology: Wild ruminants serve as an important reservoir of
infection.
Treatment and control: Anthelminitcs used to treat other gastrointestinal
nematodes are likely to be effective.
Notes: Other species include M. mongolica, which is found in the
abomasum of sheep, goats and camels in parts of Mongolia. M.

L1 on the pasture and may develop to L3 in as short a period as 5 days but
development may be delayed for weeks or months under cool conditions.
After ingestion, and exsheathment in the rumen, the larvae moult twice in
close apposition to the gastric glands. Just before the final moult they
develop the piercing lancet which enables them to obtain blood from the
mucosal vessels. As adults they move freely on the surface of the mucosa.
The prepatent period is 2-3 weeks in sheep and 4 weeks in cattle.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. Most important in tropical and
subtropical areas.
Pathogenesis: Essentially the pathogenesis of haemonchosis is that of an
acute haemorrhagic anaemia due to the blood-sucking habits of the
worms. Each worm removes about 0.05 ml of blood per day by ingestion
and seepage from the lesions, so that a sheep with 5000 H. contortus may
lose about 250 ml daily. In acute haemonchosis anaemia becomes
      r s  o 
progressive and dramatic fall in the packed red cell volume. During the
subsequent weeks the haematocrit usually stabilises at a low level, but
only at the expense of a two- to three-fold compensatory expansion of
erythropoiesis. However due to the continual loss of iron and protein into
the gastrointestinal tract and increasing inappetence, the marrow
eventually becomes exhausted and the haematocrit falls still further before
death occurs. When ewes are affected, the consequent agalactia may result
in the death of the suckling lambs. Less commonly, in heavier infections
of up to 30 000 worms, apparently healthy sheep may die suddenly from
severe haemorrhagic gastritis (Fig. 3.4). This is termed hyperacute
haemonchosis.
Perhaps as important as acute haemonchosis in tropical areas is the lesser
known syndrome of chronic haemonchosis. This develops during a
prolonged dry season when reinfection is negligible, but the pasture
becomes deficient in nutrients. Over such a period the continual loss of
blood from small persisting burdens of several hundred worms is
sufficient to produce clinical signs associated primarily with loss of
weight, weakness and inappetence rather than marked anaemia.

Clinical signs: In hyperacute cases, sheep die suddenly from
haemorrhagic gastritis.
Acute haemonchosis is characterised by anaemia, variable degrees of
oedema, of which the submandibular form and ascites are most easily
recognised, lethargy, dark coloured faeces and falling wool (Fig. 3.5)
Diarrhoea is not generally a feature. Chronic haemonchosis is associated
with progressive weight loss and weakness, neither severe anaemia nor
gross oedema being present.

Diagnosis: The history and clinical signs are often sufficient for the
marrow changes in the long bones, is also useful. Changes are usually
evident in both, although in sheep, which have just undergone 'self cure'
(see below) or are in a terminal stage of the disease, the bulk of the worm
 u    n    
have occurred so rapidly that marrow changes are minimal. The diagnosis
of chronic haemonchosis is more difficult because of the concurrent
gradual disappearance of the syndrome after anthelmintic treatment.
Pathology: In cases of acute haemonchosis, at necropsy, there may be
between 2000 and 20 000 worms present on the abomasal mucosa which
shows numerous small haemorrhagic lesions. The abomasal contents are
fluid and dark brown due to the presence of altered blood. The carcase is
o  s     so  
epiphyses into the medullary cavity.
Epidemiology: The epidemiology of H. contortus is best considered
separately, depending on whether it occurs in tropical and subtropical or in
temperate areas.
Tropical and subtropical areas
Because larval development of H. contortus occurs optimally at relatively
high temperatures, haemonchosis is primarily a disease of sheep in warm
climates. However, since high humidity, at least in the microclimate of the
survival, the frequency and severity of outbreaks of disease is largely
dependent on the rainfall in any particular area.
Given these climatic conditions, the sudden occurrence of acute clinical
haemonchosis appears to depend on two further factors. First, the high
moderate infections, means that massive pasture populations of L3 may
appear very quickly. Second, in contrast to many other helminth
infections, there is little evidence that sheep in endemic areas develop an
419
effective acquired immunity to Haemonchus, so that there is continuous
contamination of the pasture.
  i         
with the ability of H. contortus larvae to undergo hypobiosis. Although
the trigger for this phenomenon is unknown, hypobiosis occurs at the start
of a prolonged dry season and permits the parasite to survive in the host as
arrested L4 instead of maturing and producing eggs, which would
inevitably fail to develop on the arid pasture. Resumption of development
occurs just before the onset of seasonal rains. In other tropical areas such
as East Africa, no significant degree of hypobiosis has been observed and
 ns  s s u   a m p aa a s
evolutionary development unnecessary.
The survival of H. contortus infection on tropical pastures is variable
depending on the climate and degree of shade, but the infective larvae are
relatively resistant to desiccation and some may survive for 1-3 months
on pasture or in faeces.
In areas of endemic haemonchosis it has often been observed that after the
advent of a period of heavy rain the faecal worm egg counts of sheep
expulsion of the major part of the adult worm burden. This event is
commonly termed the self-cure phenomenon, and has been reproduced
existing adult infection in the abomasum. The expulsion of the adult worm
population is considered to be the consequence of an immediate-type
hypersensitivity reaction to antigens derived from the developing larvae. [t
self-cure when large numbers of larvae mature to the infective stage on
pasture after rain.
Although this phenomenon has an immunological mechanism it is not
necessarily associated with protection against reinfection since the larval
challenge often develops to maturity.
Another explanation of the self-cure phenomenon as it occurs in the field
n  s n  a i  o an o  s
contemporaneously and on pasture with insignificant numbers of infective
larvae. This suggests that the phenomenon may also be caused, in some
420
cause, self-cure is probably of mutual benefit to both host and parasite.
The former gains a temporary respite from persistent blood loss while the
generation.
Temperate areas
In the British Isles, the Netherlands and presumably in other parts of
northern Europe and in Canada, which are among the least favourable
areas for the survival of H. contortus, the epidemiology is different from
that of tropical zones. From the information available, infections seem to
  s  si   s s o i d
[nfective larvae, which have developed from eggs deposited by ewes in
the spring are ingested by ewes and lambs in early summer. The majority
of these become arrested in the abomasum as EL4 and do not complete
development until the following spring. During the period of maturation
of these hypobiotic larvae, clinical signs of acute haemonchosis may occur
and in the ewes this often coincides with lambing. The epidemiology is
proportion of ingested larvae, which did not undergo hypobiosis in early
summer.
Treatment: When an acute outbreak has occurred the sheep should be
treated with one of the benzimidazoles, levamisole, an avermectin/
milbemycin or salicylanilide and immediately moved to pasture not
recently grazed by sheep. When the original pasture is grazed again.
prophylactic measures should be undertaken, as enough larvae may have
survived to institute a fresh cycle of infection. Chronic haemonchosis is
dealt with in a similar fashion. If possible the new pasture should have a
 good nutritional value; alternatively some supplementary feeding may be
given.
Control: In the tropics and subtropics this varies depending on the
duration and number of periods in the year when rainfall and temperature
permit high pasture levels of H. contortus larvae to develop. At such times
            s
depending on the degree of challenge. Sheep should also be treated at least
once at the start of the dry season and preferably also before the start of
prolonged rain to remove persisting hypobiotic larvae whose development
421
could pose a future threat. For this purpose, one of the modern
benzimidazoles or an avermectin/milbemycin is recommended. In some
wool-producing areas where Haemonchus is endemic, closantel, which
has a residual prophylactic effect, may be used. Because of long
withdrawal periods this is of limited use in meat-producing animals.
Apart from anthelmintic prophylaxis, some studies, especially in Kenya,

world where veterinary surveillance is poor. Rapid rotation through a
series of paddocks can be effective in certain wet tropical areas (for details
refer to The treatment and control of PGE in sheep - prophylaxis by
grazing management alone).
In temperate areas, the measures outlined for the control of parasitic
gastroenteritis in sheep are usually sufficient to pre-empt outbreaks of
haemonchosis.
Currently trials are in progress to determine the efficacy of a recombinant

Notes: Until recently the sheep species was called H. contortus and the
cattle species H. placei. However there is now increasing evidence that
these are the single species H. contortus with only strain adaptations for
cattle and sheep.
Trichostrongylus axei
Synonym: Trichostrongylus extenuatus
Common name: Stomach hairworm
Predilection site:Abomasum orstomach

females 48 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: In T. axei, the male spicules are dissimilar and
unequal in length, the right being shorter than the left (Fig. 3.6a).
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, deer, horse, donkey, pig and occasionally man
Life cycle: This is direct and the preparasitic phase is typically
trichostrongyloid. The prepatent period in sheep is about 3 weeks.

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The extent of the lesions in the abomasum or stomach is
dependent on the size of the worm population. Small irregular areas,
showing diffuse congestion and whitish grey raised flat, circular lesions
may be present in the pyloric and fundic regions. These lesions are about
1-2 cm in diameter and have been termed plaques or ringworm lesions

weight loss and diarrhoea. At lower levels of infection, inappetence and
poor growth rates, sometimes accompanied by soft faeces, are the
common signs.
Diagnosis: This is based on clinical signs, seasonal occurrence of disease
and, if possible, lesions at postmortem examination. Faecal egg counts are
a useful aid to diagnosis, although faecal cultures are necessary for generic
identification of larvae. At necropsy, T. axei is easily identified from
washings and digests of the abomasum or stomach.
Pathology: In sheep, there is often extensive desquamation of the
superficial epithelium of the mucosa. A mucoid hyperplasia is seen in the
plaques and in longer-established infections there may be shallow ulcers
in the neck regions of the glands. Cellular infiltration of the lamina propria
occurs, particularly an influx of eosinophils and lymphocytes. In most
cases there is not a marked reduction in the number of parietal or zymogen
cells. Over time, infection can lead to a chronic proliferative inflammation
and shallow depressed ulcers may be present.
Epidemiology: The embryonated eggs and infective L3 of T. axei can
survive under adverse conditions. Larval numbers increase on pasture in
424
late summer/autumn often giving rise to clinical problems during the
winter and early spring. Immunity is slowly acquired and age immunity is
not well developed.
Treatment and control: See Treatment and control of parasitic
gastroenteritis (PGE) in sheep.
Parabronema skrjabini
Predilection site: Abomasum
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: The white slender adult worms (up to 3.6 cm long)
resemble Haemonchus spp somewhat in gross form and size, but without
the red spiral coloration, while the younger worms are closer to Ostertagia
in appearance. Males are 15-18 mm with one spicule.
Description, microscopic: The genus is readily distinguished from the
other abomasal worms by the presence of large cuticular shields and
cordons in the cephalic region. The tail of the male is spiral with four pairs
of pre-anal papillae.
Final host: Sheep, goat, cattle, camel
Intermediate host: Muscid flies of the genera Stomoxys and Lyperosia

Mediterranean countries, notably Cyprus
Pathogenesis: Parabronema is usually regarded as non-pathogenic,
although it can cause nodular lesions in the abomasal wall.

Epidemiology: The seasonality of infection is related to the activity of the
fly vectors.
Treatment: Treatment is normally not required.
Control: Any measures to reduce fly populations will be beneficial
SMALLINTESTINE
Trichostrongylus
Species of Trichostrongylus are small, light brownish red, hair-like
worms, and difficult to see with the naked eye. Males measure around
4.0-5.5 mm and females 5.5-7.5 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: The worms have no buccal capsule. A useful
generic character is the distinct excretory notch in the oesophageal region.
The male bursa has long lateral lobes, while the dorsal lobe is not well
defined. Spicules are stout, ridged and pigmented brown, and a
gubernaculum is present. Species identification is based on the shape and
size of the spicules (Table 3.1; Fig. 3.6). The female tail is bluntly tapered
and there is no vulval flap. Eggs are thin-shelled and typically strongyle.
Life cycle: This is direct and the preparasitic phase is typically
trichostrongyloid; eggs developing to the infective L3 in about 7-10 days
under optimal conditions. Following ingestion and exsheathment, larvae
penetrate the mucosa of the small intestine (Fig. 3.8) and after two moults
the fifth-stage worms are present under the intestinal epithelium around 2
weeks after initial infection. The prepatent period is 2-3 weeks.
Diagnosis: This is based on clinical signs, seasonal occurrence of disease
and, if possible, lesions at postmortem examination. Faecal egg counts are
426
a useful aid to diagnosis, although faecal cultures are necessary for generic
identification of larvae. At necropsy, the small intestine is often inflamed
           
flattened, red areas that are demarcated from the surrounding mucosa.
Digestion of the gut in warm physiological saline for 2-3 hours will
release the small hair-like worms for examination.

Trichostrongylus can survive under adverse conditions. In temperate areas
the L3 survive the winter, occasionally in sufficient numbers to precipitate
clinical disease in the spring, but more commonly, larval numbers increase
 on pasture in summer and autumn giving rise to clinical problems during
these seasons. Hypobiosis plays an important part in the epidemiology, the
428
seasonal occurrence being similar to that of Ostertagia spp. In contrast to
other trichostrongyles hypobiosis occurs at the L3 stage although their role
in outbreaks of disease has not been fully established.
In the southern hemisphere larvae accumulate in late winter and outbreaks
are usually seen in spring. In Australia and Africa, following a period of
drought the advent of rain has been shown to rehydrate large numbers of
apparently desiccated L3 (anhydrobiosis) which then become active and
rapidly available to grazing animals. T. colubriformis also survives
adverse environmental conditions as adult parasites within the host and
these can persist for many months.
Immunity to Trichostrongylus, as in Ostertagia, is slowly acquired and in
sheep, and probably goats, it wanes during the periparturient period.

Control: See Treatment and control of parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE) in

Notes: Trichostrongylus is rarely a primary pathogen in temperate areas,
but is usually a component of parasitic gastroenteritis in ruminants. By
contrast, in the subtropics it is one of the most important causes of
parasitic gastroenteritis.
Trichostrongylus colubriformis
Synonym: Trichostrongylus instabilis
Common name: Black scour or bankrupt worm
Predilection site: Duodenum and anterior small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: Males measure around 4.0-5.5 mm and females
5.5-7.5 mm in length.
429
Description, microscopie: In T. colubriformis, the spicules are thick,
brown, unbranched, of equal length and terminate in a barb-like tip (Table
3.1; Fig 3.6b)
Hosts: Sheep, goat, cattle, camel and occasionally pig and man
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. Although T. colubriformis
occurs in temperate regions, it is mainly a parasite of subtropical and
tropical zones.
Pathogenesis: Following ingestion, the larvae penetrate the mucosa and
developing worms are located in superficial channels sited just beneath the
surface epithelium and parallel with the luminal surface, but above the
lamina propria. When the sub-epithelial tunnels containing the developing
worms rupture to liberate the young worms about 10-12 days after
infection, there is considerable haemorrhage and oedema and plasma
proteins are lost into the lumen of the gut leading to hypoalbuminaemia
and hypoproteinaemia. Grossly there is an enteritis, particularly in the
duodenum; the villi become distorted and flattened and the mucosa is
inflamed, oedematous and covered in mucus. However many areas may
small area, erosion of the mucosal surface is apparent with severe villous
atrophy (Fig. 3.9). In heavy infections diarrhoea occurs, and this, together
with the loss of plasma protein into the lumen of the intestine and an
increase in turnover of the intestinal epithelium, leads to an impairment in
protein metabolism for growth and is reflected as weight loss. Reduced
deposition of body protein, calcium and phosphorus and efficiency of food
utilisation may occur. Heavy infections can induce osteoporosis and
osteomalacia of theskeleton.

particularly if animals are also malnourished and they receive a high larval

common signs. It is often difficult to distinguish the effects of low
infections from malnutrition.

Hosts: Sheep, goat, deer, camel, occasionally pig and man
Geographical distribution: Mainly temperate regions of the world
Pathogenesis: The macroscopic lesions in the intestine are similar to
those described for T. colubriformis, although they tend not to be as
extensive and appear to resolve earlier, possibly being indicative of an
earlier expulsion of worms than with T. coiubriformis. Frequently shallow
red depressed areas, demarcated from the more normal coloured
surrounding mucosa, are present on the surface of the intestine. These
have been termed *finger print’ lesions (Fig. 3.10). These affected areas
are devoid of villi, or the villi appear as rounded protruberances, and
induce similar adverse effects on protein and mineral metabolism to those
described for T. colubriformis.

Cooperia curticei
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: C. curticei is moderately small with a large bursa.
The most notable feature is the ‘watch spring-like’ posture. Males
measure around 4.5-6.0 mm and females 6.0-8.0 mm in length. When
fresh they appear pinkish white.
Description, microscopic: The main generic features are the small
cephalic vesicle and the transverse cuticular striations in the oesophageal
region. The body possesses longitudinal ridges. The spicules are short and
stout and have a distinct wing-like expansion in the middle region, which
      o i    
tapering tail. Eggs are oval and thin-shelled.
Hosts: Sheep, goat, deer
Life cycle: This is direct and typical of the superfamily. Ingested L3
adults develop on the surface of the intestinal mucosa. The prepatent
period is around 2 weeks. The bionomic requirements of the free-living
stages are similar to those of Teladorsagia.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: C. curticei is generally considered to be a mild pathogen in
lambs and kids although in some studies it has been associated with
433
inappetence and poor weight gains. A partial immunity to reinfection
develops after about 8-12 months of exposure to infective larvae.
Clinical signs: Low to moderate infections are often asymptomatic but
heavy worm burdens can lead to loss of appetite and poor growth rates.
Faecal culture will allow identification of infective larvae.
Pathology: Cooperia do not tunnel into the epithelium but coil among the
intestinal villi causing adjacent villous atrophy. In heavy infections there
is more widespread villous atrophy in the small intestine leading to loss of
brush border enzymes and digestive disturbance.
Epidemiology: In temperate areas, this is similar to that of Teladorsagia.
Hypobiosis at the EL4 is a regular feature during late autumn and winter in
the northern hemisphere, and spring and summer in the southern
hemisphere. Generally, first year grazing animals are most likely to
accumulate moderate worm populations. Exposure to infective pasture

usually show little clinical signs of infection but act as carriers, shedding
low numbers of eggs in their faeces. Infective larvae survive well on
pasture, being tolerant of cold conditions.
Treatment: The principles are similar to those applied in PGE in sheep.
Cooperia is one of the dose-limiting species and one should consult the
manufacturer's data sheets for efficacy of anthelmintics against adult and
L4 stages.
Control: Similar to that recommended for Teladorsagia
Notes: In temperate areas, members of the genus Cooperia usually play a
secondary role in the pathogenesis of PGE of small ruminants although
they may be the most numerous trichostrongyle present.

Description, gross: The adults are slender, the males measuring around
11-16 mm and females 15-25 mm in length. The anterior of the worm is

ridges.
Microscopic: A small but distinct cephalic vesicle is present (Fig. 3.11).
Males are characterised by having only one set of divergent rays in each
bursal lobe and the tips of the spicules are fused in a small, flattened
oval-shaped projection (Fig. 3.12c). The female worm has a long pointed
tail and the large egg is brownish with parallel sides.
Hosts: Sheep, goat and occasionally cattle (calves)
Life cycle: The preparasitic phase is almost unique in the
trichostrongylids in that development to the L3 takes place within the
eggshell. Hatching of most eggs requires a prolonged period of chill
followed by a mean day/night temperature of more than 10°C, conditions
which occur in late spring. Hence most of the eggs from one season's
grazing remain unhatched on the ground during the winter and only one
generation is possible each year for the bulk of this species. However,
autumn of the same year resulting in significant numbers of L3 on the
pasture at this time. The ingested L3 penetrate the mucosa of the small
intestine and moult to the L4 stage around the fourth day. After moulting
to the L5 the parasites inhabit the lumen, sometimes superficially coiled
around villi. The prepatent period is 14-16 days.

Geographical distribution: N. battus is most important in the British
Isles, but also occurs in Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and parts of
Canada.
Pathogenesis: Nematodirosis, due to N. battus infection, is an example of
a parasitic disease where the principal pathogenic effect is attributable to
the larval stages. Following ingestion of large numbers of L3 there is
disruption of the intestinal mucosa, particularly in the ileum, although the
majority of developing stages are found on the mucosal surface.
Development through L4 to L5 is complete by 10-12 days from infection
and this coincides with severe damage to the villi and erosion of the
 mucosa leading to villous atrophy. The ability of the intestine to exchange
fluids and nutrients is grossly impaired, and with the onset of diarrhoea
the lamb rapidly becomes dehydrated
Clinical signs: In severe infections, yellowy-green diarrhoea is the most
dehydration proceeds, the affected animals become thirsty and in infected
flocks the ewes continue to graze, apparently unaffected by the larval
challenge, while their inappetent and diarrhoeic lambs congregate round
drinking places. At necropsy, the carcase has a dehydrated appearance and
there is often an acute enteritis. The intertwining of the thin, twisted
worms in the intestine can produce an appearance similar to that of cotton
437
with pathogenic species of coccidia can exacerbate the severity of disease.
faecal egg counts are of little value in early diagnosis which is best made
on grazing history, clinical signs and, if possible, a postmortem
examination. Nematodirosis should be differentiated from coccidiosis
Pathology: Gross pathological changes may be limited to fluid mucoid
contents in the upper small intestine with occasional hyperaemia of the
mucosa of the duodenum with excess mucus on the surface. Worm counts
may reveal tangled, cottony masses of elongate, coiled nematodes. The
presence of large numbers of larvae is associated with villous atrophy and
fusion, whilst crypts may appear elongate and dilated. Local erosions may
occur if villous atrophy is severe and on histopatholgy there is a mixed
o sd s o s    
and eosinophils in the lamina propria.
Epidemiology: The three most important features of the epidemiology of
N.battus infections are:
1. The capacity of the free-living stages, particularly the egg
containing the L3, to survive on pasture; some for up to 2 years.
2. The critical hatching requirements of most eggs, which ensure the
appearance of large numbers of L3 on the pasture simultaneously,
usually in May and June. Though the flush of larvae on the pasture
may be an annual event, the appearance of clinical nematodirosis is
not; thus if the flush of L3 is early the suckling lambs may not be
consuming sufficient grass to acquire large numbers of L3, and if it
is late the lambs may be old enough to resist the larval challenge.
There is some evidence that there is an age resistance to N. battus,
which commences when lambs are about 3 months old. However,
susceptible lambs of 6-7 months can have considerableN.battus
burdens and it is therefore doubtful if this age immunity is absolute.

calves can become infected when they graze pasture that carried
lambs the previous spring
Treatment: Several drugs are effective against Nematodirus infectionsi
levamisole, an avermectin/milbemycin or one of the modern
benzimidazoles. However, Nematodirus is one of the dose-limiting species
and the manufacturer's data sheets should be consulted as there are
differences in efficacy against adults and L4 stages between oral and
parenteral administration for some macrocyclic lactones. The response to
treatment is usually rapid and, if diarrhoea persists, coccidiosis should be
considered as a complicating factor.
Control: Due to the annual hatching of N. battus eggs in spring, the
disease can be controlled by avoiding the grazing of successive lamb
crops on the same pasture. Where such alternative grazing is not available
each year, control can be achieved by anthelmintic prophylaxis, the timing
           s o
appearance of N. battus L3 is May to early June. Ideally, dosing should be
at 3-week intervals over May and June and it is unwise to await the
appearance of clinical signs of diarrhoea before administering the drugs.
Forecasting systems are based primarily on soil temperature in the early
spring which can predict the likely severity of nematodirosis. In years
when the forecast predicts severe disease, three treatments are
recommended during May and June; in other years two treatments in May
should suffice.
Notes: As anthelmintic resistance is rare in Nematodirus species it may be
advisable to use a benzimidazole against specific Nematodirus infection
and in this way reduce the selection pressure on the other families of
drugs.
Nematodirus filicollis
Common name: Thread-necked worm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
439
Description, gross: The adults are slender worms, males measuring
10-15 mm and females 15-24 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: A small but distinct cephalic vesicle is present.
The male has two sets of parallel rays in each of the main bursal lobes.
The spicules are long and slender with fused tips and terminate in a
narrow pointed swelling (Fig. 3.12a). The female has a truncate blunt tail
with a small spine (similar to N. spathiger), and the egg is large, ovoid,
thin-shelled and colourless and twice the size of the typical trichostrongyle
egg-
Hosts: Sheep, goat, occasionally cattle and deer
Life cycle: The preparasitic phase is almost unique in the
trichostrongyloids in that development to the L3 takes place within the egg
shell. N. filicoilis does not have the same critical hatching requirements as
N. battus. Hatching occurs over a more prolonged period and so larvae

in the faeces. The parasitic phase within the host is similar to that of N.
battus. The prepatent period is 2-3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Cosmopolitan, but more prevalent in
temperate zones
Pathogenesis: Similar to that of N. battus but of lesser severity
clinical manifestations. In severe infections, diarrhoea can occur during
the prepatent period and young animals may become dehydrated.
Diagnosis: Examination of faeces will enable the colourless eggs to be
penetrating into the crypts. Larvae emerge as fourth- or fifth-stage larvae
and coil among the villi with their posterior ends protruding into the
lumen. The presence of large numbers of worms leads to the development
of villous atrophy, crypt dilation and elongation. If villous atrophy is
severe the worms may not be able to maintain their position in the
intestine.
440
Epidemiology: The hatch of L3 from the eggs occurs over a more
prolonged period than with N. battus, numbers of larvae accumulate on
with outbreaks of nematodirosis in small ruminants it is more common to
find it in conjunction with the other trichostrongyles that contribute to
ovine PGE.
Treatment:See Nematodirus battus.
Control: Disease due to monospecific Nematodirus filicollis infections is
rarely seen. They are usually part of the worm burden of trichostrongyloid
species that are responsible for the syndrome of PGE in sheep and as such
may be controlled by the measures outlined elsewhere.
Nematodirus spathiger
Common name: Thread-necked worm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are slender worms, males measuring
around 10-14 mm and females 15-24 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: A small but distinct cephalic vesicle is present.
The male has two sets of parallel rays in each of the main bursal lobes.
The spicules are long and slender with fused tips and terminate in a
spoon-shaped tip (Fig. 3.12b). The female has a truncate blunt tail with a
small spine (similar to N. filicollis), and the egg is large, ovoid,
thin-shelled and colourless and twice the size of the typical trichostrongyle
egg-
Hosts: Sheep, goats, occasionally cattle and other ruminants
Life cycle:  The preparasitic phase is almost unique in the
trichostrongyloids in that development to the L3 takes place within the egg
shell. N. spathiger does not have the same critical hatching requirements
as N.battus. Larvae can appear on the pasture within 3-4 weeks of eggs
441
being excreted in the faeces; more than one annual generation is therefore
possible. The parasitic phase is similar to that of N. battus. The prepatent
period is 2-3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Cosmopolitan
Pathogenesis: Similar to that of N. battus but of lesser severity

differentiated from the brown eggs of N. battus. At necropsy the tips of
the male spicules will allow diagnosis from other Nematodirus species.
Pathology: As for N. filicollis

pattern of infection is similar to that of Trichostrongylus species.

Bunostomumtrigonocephalum
Synonym:Monodontus trigonocephalum
Common name: Hookworm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ancylostomatoidea
Description, gross: Bunostomum is one of the larger nematodes of the
small intestine of ruminants, being 1.0-3.0 cm long, stout, greyish white
and characteristically hooked at the anterior end with the buccal capsule
opening anterodorsally.
 s  so jo d e    o sn p
internally a large dorsal cone. Dorsal teeth are absent from the buccal
capsule but there is a pair of small sub-ventral lancets at its base. In the
442
male the bursa is well developed and has an asymmetrical dorsal lobe. The
right externodorsal ray arises higher up on the dorsal stem and is longer
than the left. It arises near the bifurcation of the dorsal ray, which divides
into two tri-digitate branches. The spicules are slender, twisted and
the middle of the body.
The infective larva is small with 16 gut cells and a short filamentous tail.
The eggs is medium sized (90 × 51 μm), irregular broad elipse in shape,
with dissimilar sidewalls and 4-8 blastomeres.
Hosts: Sheep, goat, camel, deer
Life cycle: Infection with the L3 may be percutaneous or oral. After skin
penetration, the larvae travel to the lungs and moult to fourth-stage larvae
Ingested larvae usually develop without a migration. Further development
continues in the gut. The prepatent period is 4-8 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The adult worms are blood-suckers and infections of
100-500 worms can produce progressive anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia,
loss of weight and occasionally diarrhoea. Worm burdens of around 600
may lead to death in sheep.
Clinical signs: The main clinical signs are progressive anaemia, with
associated changes in the blood picture, hydraemia and oedema, which
become weak and emaciated and the appetite usually decreases. The skin
is dry and the wool of sheep falls out in irregular patches. Diarrhoea may
occur, and the faeces may be dark because of altered blood pigments.
Collapse and death may occur.
Diagnosis: The clinical signs of anaemia and perhaps diarrhoea in young
sheep are not in themselves pathognomonic of bunostomosis. However, in
temperate areas, the epidemiological background may be useful in
eliminating the possibility of Fasciola hepatica infection.In the tropics,
larvae. Faecal worm egg counts are useful in that these are lower than in
Haemonchus infection, while the eggs are more bluntly rounded, with
443
relatively thick sticky shells to which debris is often adherent. For
accurate differentiation, larval cultures should be prepared.
Pathology: The carcase is anaemic and cachexic. Oedema and ascites are
seen. The liver is light brown and shows fatty changes. The intestinal
contents are haemorrhagic and the mucosa is usually swollen, covered
with mucus, and shows numerous lesions resulting from the worms
feeding. The parasites may be seen still attached to the mucosa or free in
the lumen.
Epidemiology: Pathogenic infections are more common in the tropics and
subtropics and, in some areas, the highest worm burdens are found at the
end of the dry season apparently due to the maturation of hypobiotic
larvae. Young animals are most susceptible. In temperate countries, high
worm burdens are usually uncommon. The prophylactic dosing regimes,
adopted for the control of trichostrongyles, has contributed to the low
prevalence of Bunostomum.
Treatment: The prophylactic anthelmintic regimes advocated for other
 gastrointestinal nematodes are usually sufficient.
Control: A combination of strategic dosing with anthelmintics and
pasture management as used in the control of ovine PGE is effective.
Larvae are susceptible to dessication, and the infection is mainly found on
permanently or occasionally moist pastures. Avoiding or draining such
should be kept hard and dry, or treated with liberal applications of salt.
Housed sheep and goats should be protected by ensuring the floors and

Gaigeria pachyscalis
Common name: Hookworm
Predilection site: Duodenum and small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ancylostomatoidea
444
Description, gross: Adult males are up to 2 cm; females are up to 3 cm
long-
cone, but no dorsal tooth, and a pair of sub-ventral lancets, which have
several cusps each. The male bursa has small lateral lobes joined together
ventrally, and a large dorsal lobe. The anterolateral ray is short and blunt
 o         
arise from the main stem of the dorsal ray, which is split for about a
quarter of its length, the two short branches ending in very small
digitations. The spicules are slender with recurved barb ends.
Hosts: Sheep, goat, wild ruminants
Life cycle: The life cycle is thought to be direct; the main route of
infection is percutaneous. Infective L3 larvae are susceptible to
desiccation.
Geographical distribution: South America, South Africa, Indonesia and
parts of Asia
Pathogenesis: The parasite is a voracious blood sucker; as few as
100-200 worms are sufficient to produce death in sheep within a few
weeks.
Clinical signs: Causes severe anaemia and death.
Diagnosis: Demonstration of the characteristic large eggs in the faeces
Pathology: As for B. trigonocephalum
Epidemiology: As for B. trigonocephalum
Treatment and control: As for B. trigonocephaium
Strongyloides papillosus
Common name: Threadworm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Rhabditoidea
445
Description, gross: Slender, hair-like worms generally less than l.0 cm
1ong
Description, microscopic: Only females are parasitic. The long
oesophagus may occupy up to one third of the body length and the uterus
Unlike other intestinal parasites of similar size the tail has a blunt point
(Fig. 3.13). Strongyloides eggs are oval, thinshelled and small, being half
the size of typical strongyle eggs. In herbivores it is the larvated egg
which is passed out in the faeces, but in other animals it is the hatched L1.
Hosts: Sheep, cattle, other ruminants and rabbits
Life cycle: Strongyloides is unique among the nematodes of veterinary
importance, being capable of both parasitic and free-living reproductive
cycles. The parasitic phase is composed entirely of female worms in the
small intestine and these produce larvated eggs by parthenogenesis, i.e.
development from an unfertilised egg. After hatching, larvae may develop
through four larval stages into free-living adult male and female worms
and this can be followed by a succession of free-living generations.
However under certain conditions, possibly related to temperature and
          
penetration or ingestion and migrating via the venous system, the lungs
and trachea to develop into adult female worms in the small intestine

Lambs and calves may acquire infection immediately after birth from the
mobilisation of arrested larvae in the tissues of the ventral abdominal wall
of the dam, which are subsequently excreted in the milk. In addition,
prenatal infection has been demonstrated experimentally in cattle. The
prepatent period is 8-14 days.

Pathogenesis: Skin penetration by infective larvae may cause an
          
Organisms of foot-rot. Passage of larvae through the lungs has been shown
of the lung surfaces. Mature parasites are found in the duodenum and
proximal jejunum and if present in large numbers may cause inflammation
with oedema and erosion of the epithelium. This results in a catarrhal
enteritis with impairment of digestion and absorption.
447
Clinical signs: The common clinical signs, usually seen only in very
young animals, are diarrhoea, anorexia, dullness, loss of weight or reduced
growthrate.
Diagnosis: The clinical signs in very young animals, usually within the
first few weeks of life, together with the finding of large numbers of the
characteristic eggs or  larvae in  the  faeces  are  suggestive  of
strongyloidosis. It should be emphasised however that high faecal egg

of the villi in the small intestine. In large numbers they may cause villous
atrophy, with a mixed mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration of the
lamina propria. Crypt epithelium is hyperplastic and there is villous
clubbing-
Epidemiology: Strongyloides infective larvae are not ensheathed and are
susceptible to extreme climatic conditions. However warmth and moisture
favour development and allow the accumulation of large numbers of
infective stages. For this reason, it can be a major problem in housed
calves up to 6 months of age in some Mediterranean countries. A second
major source of infection for the very young animal is the reservoir of
larvae in the tissues of their dams andthis may leadto clinical
same dam often show heavy infections.
Treatment: Specific control measures for Strongyfoides infection are
rarely called for. The benzimidazoles and the avermectins/milbemycins
Control: Reduction in numbers of free-living larvae by removal of faeces

infection by skin penetration.
Capillaria longipes
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
448
Description, gross: These are very fine filamentous worms, the narrow
Males measure around 11-13 mm and females up to 20 mm.
Description, microscopic: The males have a long thin single spicule, 1.2
mm long, and often possess a primitive bursa-like structure. The females
contain eggs that resemble those of Trichuris in possessing bipolar plugs.
The eggs are barrel-shaped, 45-50 × 22-25 μm and colourless; they have
thick shells that are slightly striated with bipolar plugs.
Hosts: Sheep, goat
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. The infective L1 develops within the
egg in about 3-4 weeks. Infection of the final host is through ingestion of
this embryonated infective stage, development to adult worms occurs
without a migration phase. The prepatent period is 3-4 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Considered to be of low pathogenicity and of little
veterinary significance.
Clinical signs: No clinical signs have been attributed to infection with this
parasite.
Diagnosis: Because of the non-specific nature of the clinical signs and the
   q   s s y i  
present in the faeces, diagnosis depends on necropsy and careful
examination of the small intestine for the presence of the worms. This
may be carried out by microscopic examination of mucosal scrapings
squeezed between two glass slides; alternatively the contents should be
 gently washed through a fine sieve and the retained material resuspended
in water and examined against a black background.
Pathology: No associated pathology
Epidemiology: Infection is by ingestion of the larvated eggs and is
common in sheep though not significant.
Treatment: Not usually required
Control: Not required

Moniezia expansa
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Anoplocephalidae
Description, gross: These are long tapeworms, 2 m or more in length.
which are unarmed, possessing prominent suckers.
Description, microscopic: Segments are broader than they are long (up to
1.5 cm wide) and contain two sets of genital organs grossly visible along
the lateral margin of each segment. There is a row of inter-proglottidal
species differentiation. In M. expansa they extend along the full breadth of
the segment. The irregularly triangular eggs have a well defined pyriform
apparatus and vary from 55-75 μm in diameter.
Final hosts: Sheep, goats, occasionally cattle
Intermediate hosts: Forage mites, mainly of the family Oribatidae
Life cycle: Mature proglottids or eggs are passed in the faeces and on
pasture where the oncospheres are ingested by forage mites. The embryos
cysticercoids in 1-4 months and infection of the final host is by ingestion
 of infected mites during grazing. The prepatent period is approximately 6
weeks, but the adult worms appear to be short lived, patent infections
persisting for only 3 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Although generally regarded as of little pathogenic
New Zealand, of heavy infections causing unthriftiness, diarrhoea and
even intestinal obstruction. However, Moniezia infections are so obvious,
both in life, because of the presence of proglottids in the faeces, and at
necropsy, that other causes of ill health may be overlooked. It is
interesting that experimental studies have failed to demonstrate substantial
clinical effects even with fairly heavy worm burdens.
450
Clinical signs: While a great variety of clinical signs, including
unthriftiness, diarrhoea, respiratory signs and even convulsions, have been
attributed to Moniezia, infections are generally symptomless. Subclinical
effects remain to be established
Diagnosis: This is based largely on the presence of mature proglottids in
the faeces and the characteristic shape of Moniezia eggs (triangular, M.
expansa, quadrangular, M. benedeni) that contain the oncosphere. The
eggs of M. benedeni are slightly larger than those of M. expansa.
Pathology: Little pathology is associated with the presence of light
infections. Heavy infections may produce a solid mass of tapeworms that
may occlude the intestinal lumen.
Epidemiology: Infection is common in lambs, kids and calves during
their first year of life and less common in older animals. A seasonal
       
related to active periods of the forage mite vectors during the summer in
temperate areas. The cysticercoids can overwinter in the mites.
Treatment: In many countries several drugs, including niclosamide.
praziquantel, bunamidine and a number of broad-spectrum benzimidazole
compounds, which have the advantage of also being active against
gastrointestinal nematodes, are available for the treatment of Moniezia
infection. If this is carried out in lambs and calves in late spring, in
temperate areas, the numbers of newly infected mites on pasture will be
reduced.
Control: Ploughing and reseeding, or avoiding the use of the same
pastures for young animals in consecutive years, may prove beneficial.
Notes: This genus of cestodes is common in ruminants and resembles, in
most respects, Anoplocephala of the horse. Moniezia spp are only the
tapeworms of ruminants in many countries of western Europe.
Other species of tapeworms are found in the small intestine of sheep and
goats. Many of the details are essentially similar to Moniezia.

Sheep coccidia
Eleven species of Eimeria have been identified in sheep, distinguished
primarily 0n 0ocyst morphology (Table 15.6; Fig. 15.20). Each stage of
each individual coccidial species has its preferences as to which cells it
infects and which parts of the gut it infects. Those infecting the posterior
part of the intestine tend to be more harmful.
Although the majority of sheep, particularly those under l year old, carry
coccidia, only two species (E. crandallis and E. ovinoidalis) are known to
be highly pathogenic. It was thought for many years that the species of
studies have shown, however, that although morphologically similar,
coccidia in small ruminants are host-specific and cross-infection between
sheep and goats does not occur.
The following general descriptions apply to sheep and goat Eimeria.
Life cycle: The life cycles of all species are typically coccidian (see
Chapter 1: Parasite taxonomy and morphology, Phylum: Apicomplexa).
Following ingestion of the sporulated oocyst there are usually two
some species, followed by smaller second-generation meronts. During
gametogony, fusion of macrogametocytes and microgametocytes leads to

contain four sporocysts each containing two sporozoites. The life cycle
takes between 2 and 4 weeks, depending on the species of Eimeria.
Pathogenesis: The most pathogenic species of coccidia are those that
infect and destroy the crypt cells of the large intestinal mucosa. This is
because the ruminant small intestine is very long, providing a large
number of host cells and the potential for enormous parasite replication
with minimal damage. If the absorption of nutrients is impaired, the large
intestine is, to some extent, capable of compensating. Those species that
invade the large intestine are more likely to cause pathological changes,
particularly if large numbers of oocysts are ingested over a short period of
time. Here, the rate of cellular turnover is much lower and there is no
 s  s    s    
become heavily infected, the mucosa becomes completely denuded
resulting in severe haemorrhage and impaired water resorption, leading to
diarrhoea, dehydration and death. In lighter infections, the effect on the
intestinal mucosa is to impair local absorption. Species that develop more
superficially in the small intestine cause a change in villous architecture
 a o  e pn i h d ui  e 
border, giving the appearance of a *flat mucosa'. These changes result in a
reduction of the surface area available for absorption and consequently a
reduced feedefficiency.
Clinical signs: Clinical signs vary from loss of pellet formation to weight
loss, anorexia and diarrhoea (with or without blood) (Fig. 3. 14).
Pathology: On postmortem, there may be little to see beyond thickening
and petechiation of the bowel but mucosal scrapings will reveal masses of
gamonts and oocysts. Giant meronts may be seen in the mucosa of the
small intestine as pin-point white spots (Fig. 3.15), but unless they are in
vast numbers they cause little harm. The most pathogenic stages are the
gamonts (Fig. 3.16)
Epidemiology: Coccidia are normally present in animals of all ages and
usually cause no clinical signs, as immunity is quickly acquired and
maintainedbycontinuous exposure

Development of disease is dependent on a number of factors, in particular
husbandry and management.

458
Adult animals are highly resistant to the disease, but not totally resistant to
infection. As a result, small numbers of parasites manage to complete their
life cycle and usually cause no detectable harm. In the wild or under more
natural, extensive systems of management, susceptible animals are
exposed to only low numbers of oocysts and acquire a protective
immunity. Extensive grazing, as occurs under natural conditions in the
wild, limits the level of exposure to infective oocysts. Under modern
production systems, however, lambs or kids are born into a potentially
heavily contaminated environment, and, where the numbers of sporulated
oocysts are high, disease often occurs. Three management factors are
associated with the development of high levels of infection and the
development of disease: pens are not cleaned on a regular basis;

exposed to heavy oocyst challenge. Under unhygienic, overcrowded
conditions, the lambs or kids will be exposed to and ingest a large
proportion of this infection and will develop severe disease and may even
die from the infection. If conditions are less crowded and more hygienic,
the infective dose ingested will be lower, they may show moderate, slight
 or no clinical signs and develop an immunity to reinfection, but they in
turn will have multiplied the infection a millionfold. Stress factors, such as
poor milk supply, weaning, cold weather and transport, will reduce any
acquired resistance and exacerbate the condition. A major problem in
milking goatherds is that, in an attempt to ensure a constant year-round
milk supply, births often take place over an extended period of time. If the
same pens are used constantly for successive batches, or if young kids are
added to a pen already housing older animals, then the later born kids are
immediately exposed to heavy challenge and can show severe coccidiosis
in the first few weeks of life.
460
Colostrum provides passive immunity to coccidiosis during the first few
weeks of life. Thereafter, susceptibility to coccidial infections has been
found progressively to increase. Subsequently animals acquire resistance
to coccidia as a result of active immunity. While animals of all ages are
susceptible to infection, younger animals are generally more susceptible to
     o s    
during the first few months of life and may or may not show signs of
disease. Those that reach adulthood are highly resistant to the pathogenic
effects of the parasites but may continue to harbour small numbers
throughout their lives.
Occasionally, acute coccidiosis occurs in adult animals with impaired
cellular immunity or in those which have been subjected to stress, such as
dietary changes, prolonged travel, extremes of temperature and weather
conditions, changes in environment or severe concurrent infection. An
animal's nutritional status and mineral and vitamin deficiencies can also
influence resistance to infection. Suckling animals, in addition to
benefiting from colostral intake, may forage less and hence pick up fewer
oocysts from pasture. Well nourished animals may simply be able to fight
off infection more readily.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis should be based on history, clinical signs (severe

million oocysts per gram of faeces, whereas in animals dying of
nonpathogenic species could mask significant numbers of the more
pathogenic species, for instance, and give the impression that the abundant
species was the cause.
Treatment: Outbreaks of clinical coccidiosis can appear suddenly and
 may prove troublesome to resolve as they often occur on heavily stocked
farms, particularly where good husbandry and management are lacking. If
deaths are occurring, early confirmation of the diagnosis is vital and
should be based on history, postmortem examination and intestinal
461
smears. Affected animals should be medicated and moved
【to
uncontaminated pens or pasture as soon as possible.
Normally all animals in a group should be treated, as even those showing
no symptoms are likely to be infected. Severely infected animals that are
diarrhoeic and dehydrated may require oral or intravenous rehydration.
Where non-specific symptoms of weight loss or ill-thrift are present, it is
important  to  investigate   all  potential  causes  and   seek  laboratory
through advice on management and instigation of preventative measures
outlined earlier. Batch rearing of animals of similar ages limits the
build-up and spread of oocysts and allows targeting of treatment to
susceptible age groups during the danger periods.

Whilst the same compounds used for the treatment and control of
coccidiosis in sheep should be effective in goats, little data or information
are available on the efficacy of these compounds in goats.
Control: Animals particularly at risk from coccidiosis are those kept
indoors on damp bedding, or those on contaminated heavily stocked
pastures, particularly in cold wet weather. The incidence of disease can be
462
reduced through avoidance of overcrowding and stress, and attention to
hygiene. Raising of food and water troughs, for example, can help avoid
contamination by reducing the levels of infection. Young animals should

29-37 × 17-28 μm (mean 33.4 × 22.6 μm) with a micropyle and a
micropylar cap and have one or occasionally more polar granules, without
a residuum. Sporocysts are 12-22 × 6-10 μm without a Stieda body and

Second-generation meronts measure 52  × 39 μm and contain
approximately 50 merozoites. Intranuclear stages have been observed in
small intestinal epithelial cells, 15, 18 and 19 days after experimental
infection. The developing parasites are 1.6-5 μm in size and are mostly
localised within a tiny cavity of the nucleus. Each intranuclear parasite is
surrounded by a halo, and most contain two to four dark-staining and
probably dividing nuclei and appear to be second-generation merozoites.

The macrogamonts are 35-45 μm in diameter and the microgamonts are
6.5 × 26 μm.
Life cycle: First-generation meronts are localised along the length of the
appear in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells 15-20 days after infection. The
gamonts appear at 11 days post infection, suggesting that merogony and
gametogony run parallel for a time. Most sexual stages develop in
epithelial cells of the crypts. The prepatent period is 18-21 days and the
patent period is 10-12 days. Sporulation time is 2-3 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Not considered to be pathogenic, although there have been
some reports of E. ahsata causing diarrhoea, inappetance, weight loss and
even death.

found in the epithelial cells of the small intestine villi. Synchronous
division of the parasites occurs. The microgamonts contain a large
19-29 days and the patent period around 10 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Papilloma-like lesions may occur in the small intestine,
usually as a sequel to gametocyte formation, but these are not of great
pathogenic significance.
Pathology: A few small, slightly haemorrhagic areas are seen scattered
throughout the lining of the small intestine and thick, white, opaque
patches, made up of groups of heavily parasitised villi, are present leading
to the formation of polyps (Fig. 3.17).

Diagnosis: The presence of polyps containing large numbers of gamonts
and oocysts is indicative of E. bakuensis infection. Oocysts are prevalent
in the faeces of sheep of all ages, and coccidiosis cannot be diagnosed
solely by finding 0ocysts. Peak oocyst counts of >1 000 000/g faeces have
been reported in clinically healthy lambs.

Goat coccidia
Nine species of coccidia have been identified in goats based on oocyst
morphology and predilection site (Table 15.7; Fig 15.21). Eimeria
ninakohlyakimovae and E. caprina cause widespread denudation of the
469
mucosa in the upper and lower large intestine in young kids. E. arfoingi is
probably  the most commonly encountered coccidia causing polyp
formation and focal hyperplasia of the mucosa. Other species that are
considered pathogenic in goats are E. christenseni and E. hirci.

Description: The 0ocysts are 0void or ellipsoidal, 27-44 × 17-31 μm
(mean 38 × 25 μm), colourless to pale yellow, with a micropyle and
micropylar cap. One or more polar granules are present but there is no
00cyst residuum. Sporocysts are broadly 0void, 12-18 × 8-11 μm. Each
has a residuum and the Stieda body is either vestigial or absent. The
sporozoites are elongate and lie lengthwise head to tail in the sporocysts.
Each has one or more clear globules. First-generation meronts when
mature are ellipsoidal, 100-277 x 81-130 μm and contain thousands of
straight merozoites about 6-8 × 1-2 μm. Second-generation meronts are
9-20 × 8-12 μm and contain 8-24 merozoites, and sometimes a residuum.

microgametes (3 x 0.5 μm) and a residuum.
Life cycle: First-generation meronts are situated in the endothelial cells of
the lacteals of the jejunum and ileum, and in the lamina propria and lymph
vessels of the submucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes. Second-generation
meronts occur 16 days after infection, mostly in epithelial cells of the
470
crypts, and less often in those of the villi in the small intestine and also in
the sinuses of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Gamonts are present in the
days after infection. The prepatent period is 14-23 days and the patent
period is 3-30+ days. The sporulation time is 3-6 days.

Pathogenesis: This species is one of the more pathogenic in young goats,
infection causing desquamation of the mucosa and superficial necrosis.
Pathology: Focal aggregates of coccidia, particularly gamonts and
0ocysts, occur in the jejunum and ileum and are associated with local
infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells, epithelial necrosis and
submucosal oedema. Superficial desquamation of  the mucosa and
superficial necrosis are also present. The capillaries are congested and
there are petechial haemorrhages. The cellular reaction in the submucosa
consists of lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, neutrophils and
eosinophils. In the lymph nodes there is oedema and perivascular
infiltration by lymphocytes. There are white foci in the intestine consisting
essentially of masses of macrogametes, microgamonts and oocysts in the
epithelial cells of the tips and sides of the villi and in the crypts.

Hosts: Goat
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal, to subspherical, light brown to
brownish yellow, 18-23 x 14-19 μm (mean 20.7 × 16.2 μm) with a
micropyle and micropylar cap, one or more polar granules, but no oocyst
residuum. Sporocysts are ovoid, 8-14 x 4-9 μm with a tiny Stieda body
and a residuum. The sporozoites lie lengthwise, at an angle, or even at the
ends of the sporocysts and have one to two clear globules.
Life cycle: Details of the life cycle are not known. The prepatent period is
13-16 days and the patent period is 5-14 days. The sporulation time is
1-3 days.
Geographical distribution: Presumed to be worldwide
Pathogenesis: This species is considered pathogenic but lesions and
pathology have not been described in detail.
Clinical signs: Clinical signs for E. christenseni, E. hirci, E.
ninakohlyakimovae and E caprina (see Large intestine) are similar.
[nfection leads loss of appetite, unthriftiness and profuse diarrhoea, often
containing streaks of blood. If left untreated, these animals may continue
to scour and eventually die of dehydration.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on history, age, postmortem lesions and
numbers in both healthy and diseased animals so that postmortem or
oocyst differentiation is advisable.
Epidemiology: Managemental factors associated with the development of
high levels of infection and the development of disease are overcrowding,
dirty conditions and repeat use of rearing pens for different age groups of
young goats. If the same pens are used constantly for successive batches,
or if young goats are added to a pen already housing older animals, then

Control: Good management and hygiene practices, by regular moving of
feed and water troughs, avoidance of overcrowding and stress, batch
rearing and feeding of dams prior to parturition, can all help to reduce the
incidence of infection.

contains a single nucleus when mature, with numerous chromatoid bodies
of various sizes and abundance, and a cytoplasmic glycogen granule.
Hosts: Sheep, goat
Life cycle: Trophozoites divide by binary fission. Before encysting, the
amoebae round up, become smaller and lay down a cyst wall. Each cyst

LARGEINTESTINE
Oesophagostomum columbianum
Common name: Nodular worm
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Strongyloidea
Description, gross: Adults are slender worms (male 12-17 mm, female
15-22 mm) with large cervical alae, which produce a marked dorsal
curvature of the anterior part of the body.
Description, microscopic: The cuticle forms a high mouth-collar shaped
like a truncate cone, and separated from the rest of the body by a
constriction. The cephalic vesicle is anterior to a cervical groove behind
which arise the cervical alae pierced by cervical papillae. External leaf
crowns consist of 20-24 elements and the internal has two small elements
to each external element. The male bursa is well developed with two equal
alate spicules.
The egg is a medium-sized (73-89 x 34-45 μm), regular broad elipse with
barrel-shaped walls, and contains 8-16 blastomeres when passed in the
faeces. The L3 have long filamentous tails, 32 gut cells and a rounded
head.
Hosts: Sheep, goat, wild ruminants
Life cycle: The preparasitic phase is typically strongyloid and infection is
by ingestion of L3, which enter the mucosa of any part of the small or
large intestine becoming enclosed in obvious nodules in which the moult
to L4 takes place. These L4 then emerge on to the mucosal surface,
migrate to the colon and develop to the adult stage. On reinfection with
most species the larvae may remain arrested as L4 in nodules for up to 1
year. The prepatent period is about 45 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide; more important in tropical and
subtropical areas
479
Pathogenesis: In the intestine, O. cofumbianum L3 migrate deep into the
nodules, which are visible to the naked eye. On reinfection, this response
       s    
    ti      s o 
ulceration of the mucosa. Diarrhoea occurs coincident with emergence
about a week after primary infection and from several months to a year
the disease runs a chronic debilitating course with effects on the
production of wool and mutton. The nodules in the gut wall also render
the intestines useless for processing as sausage skins and surgical suture
material.
Clinical signs: [n acute infections, severe dark green diarrhoea is the main
clinical sign and there is usually a rapid loss of weight, emaciation,
prostration and death in young animals. In chronic infections, there is
inappetence and emaciation with intermittent diarrhoea and anaemia.
Diagnosis: This is based on clinical signs and postmortem examination.
Since the acute disease occurs within the prepatent period, eggs of
Oesophagostomum spp are not usually present in the faeces. In the chronic
disease eggs are present and L3 can be identified following faecal culture.
Pathology: On postmortem, the carcase is emaciated, the mesenteric
lymph nodes are enlarged, and the colonic mucosa is thickened, congested
and covered by a layer of mucus in which the worms are scattered. There
is hyperplasia of goblet cells, and the lamina propria contains a heavy
mixed inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes and plasma
cells. Nodules caused by histotropic L4, mainly in the large intestine, are
0.5-3 cm in diameter and comprise a central caseous or mineralised core
surrounded by a thin, fibrous, encapsulating stroma. Microscopically, the
nematode or its remnants are present among a mass of necrotic debris in
which eosinophils are prominent. Giant cells and macophages may
surround the necrotic material. Similar nodules may be found in liver,
lungs, mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes. Those in the deeper layers
of the gut project from the serosal surface ('pimply gut') and may cause
adhesion to adjacent loops of gut or to other organs, and rarely may incite
intussusception or peritonitis. In most cases, however, nodules are
incidental findings at autopsy. They are probably the response to
histotropic L4 in hosts sensitised by L3, or the result of prior infection.
480
The nodules caused by the histotropic L3 consist of small concentrations
of suppurative exudate, which resolve as minor foci of granulomatous
inflammation after the evacuation of the larvae.
Epidemiology: In tropical and subtropical areas, O. columbianum in
sheep is especially important. The prolonged survival of the L4 within the
nodules in the gut wall and the lack of an effective immunity made control
difficult until the advent of effective anthelmintics.
(benzimidazoles, levamisole and avermectins/milbemycins) is highly
effective.
Control: A combination of strategic dosing with anthelmintics and
pasture management, as used in the control of other nematodes, will also
help to control O. columbianum.
Notes: The more pathogenic species in sheep occur in the subtropics and
tropics and are associated with nodule formation in the intestine.
Oesophagostomum venulosum
Common name: Large bowel worm
Fig. 3.18 Anterior of Oesophagostomum venulosum showing the large
inflated cephalic vesicle.
481
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Strongyloidea
Description, gross: Adult worms are slender, with males 11-16 mm, and
female 13-24 mm long.
Description, microscopic: The head has a shallow buccal capsule with an
external leaf crown of 18 elements. The external crown is compressed so
there is only a narrow opening into the buccal capsule. There are no lateral
cervical alae and the cervical papillae are posterior to the oesophagus.
Around the anterior oesophagus there is an inflated cuticular cephalic
vesicle (Fig. 3.18). This terminates in a cervical groove, which is followed
in some species by broad cervical alae. In the male the bursa is well
developed. The egg is a medium-sized (85 × 51 μm), regular broad elipse
with barrel-shaped walls, and contains 16-32 blastomeres when passed in
482
the faeces. The L3 have long filamentous tails, 32 gut cells and a rounded
head.
Hosts: Sheep, goat, deer, camel
Life cycle: The egg hatches on the ground releasing the first-stage larva,
which moults to the second stage, and then to the infective third stage. The
host is infected by ingestion of the larva with the herbage. There is no
migration stage in the body, although there is limited evidence that skin
penetration is possible. The larvae moult again and the fourth-stage larvae
attach to, or enter, the wall of the intestine. Fourth-stage larvae return to
the lumen and pass to the colon. The prepatent period is about 7 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Generally considered non-pathogenic
Clinical signs: Not associated with clinical signs
Diagnosis: Diagnosis of gastrointestinal nematodes generally is based on
Faecal worm egg counts are not that useful, as the eggs of O. venulosum
are difficult to differentiate from other trichostrongyle eggs. For accurate
differentiation, larval cultures should be prepared.
Pathology: O. venufosum seldom causes significant nodule formation (c.f.
O. columbianum) and when it does the nodules are small and mainly
confined to the caecum and colon.
Epidemiology: The basic epidemiology of O. venulosum is similar to
other trichostrongylid infections of sheep and is described in more detail

survives until the next spring. The species is also capable of overwintering

Other species of Oesophagostomum have been reported in sheep and
goats. Little is known of their pathogenesis and treatment is not usually
indicated.

Chabertia ovina
Common name: Large-mouthed bowel worm
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Strongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are 1.5-2.0 cm in length and are the
largest nematodes found in the colon of ruminants. They are white, stout
484
with a markedly truncated and enlarged anterior end due to the presence of
the very large buccal capsule (Fig. 3.19).
Description, microscopic: The huge buccal capsule, which is bell shaped.
has a double row of small papillae around the rim. There are no teeth.
There is a shallow ventral cervical groove, and anterior to it a slightly
inflated cephalic vesicle. In the male, the bursa is well developed and the
spicules are 1.3-1.7 mm long, with a gubernaculum. [n the female, the
have a rounded head, 32 gut cells and a long filamentous tail. The egg is a
mediumsized (90 x 50 μm), regular broad elipse, with 16-32 blastomeres.
Hosts: Sheep, goat, occasionally deer, cattle and other ruminants
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. Eggs are passed in the faeces and hatch
on the ground releasing the first-stage larva, which moults to the second
stage, and then to the infective third stage. The host is infected by
ingestion of the larva with the herbage. In the parasitic phase the L3 enter
colon; after a week they moult, the L4 emerge on to the mucosal surface
and migrate to congregate in the caecum where development to the L5 is
completed about 25 days after infection. The young adults then travel to
the colon. There is no migration stage in the body. The prepatent period is
about 6-7 weeks.
Fig. 3.19 Head of Chabertia ovina illustrating the large bellshaped buccal
capsule.
485
Geographical distribution: Worldwide but more prevalent in temperate
regions
Pathogenesis: Chabertia ovina is present, usually in low numbers, in the
majority of sheep and goats. It contributes to the syndrome of parasitic
clinical disease on its own. The major pathogenic effect is caused by the
buccal capsules and then feed by ingesting large plugs of tissue, resulting
in local haemorrhage and loss of protein through the damaged mucosa. A
burden of around 3o0 worms is considered pathogenic and in severe
Outbreaks the effects become evident during the late prepatent period. The
wall of the colon becomes oedematous, congested and thickened with
small haemorrhages at the sites of worm attachment.
Clinical signs: Moderate infections are usually asymptomatic. In severe
infections, diarrhoea, which may contain blood and mucus and in which
worms may be found, is the most common clinical sign. The sheep
become anaemic and hypoalbuminaemic and can suffer severe weight
loss.
Diagnosis: Since much of the pathogenic effect occurs within the
prepatent period, the faecal egg count may be very low. However, during
the diarrhoeic phase, the worms may be expelled and they are easily
recognised. At necropsy, diagnosis is generally based on the lesions since
the worm burden may be negligible following the expulsion of worms in
the faeces, although in some cases worms may be observed attached to the
mucosa of the colon.

processes. Eggs are asymmetrically flattened, larvated and measure 55-60
× 32-35 μm.
Hosts: Sheep, goat
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. Embryonated eggs are deposited on the
perineal skin by the adult female worms. Infection is by ingestion of the
embryonated egg. The prepatent period is about 25 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The pinworms cause negligible pathological disturbance
Clinical signs: These pinworms have rarely been incriminated as a cause
of disease and are usually recognised only at necropsy.
Diagnosis: Identification of the worms on postmortem, or the larvated
eggs in faeces
Pathology: No associated pathology

This genus of small pinworms contains several species parasitic in the
caecum and colon, details of which are essentially similar to Skrjabinema
ovis.

Trichuris ovis
Synonym: Trichocephalus ovis
Common name: Whipworms
488
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: The adults are long white worms about 48 cm (male
5-8 cm; females 3.5-7 cm) with a thick broad posterior end tapering
rapidly to a long filamentous anterior end that is characteristically
embedded in the mucosa.
Description, microscopic: The male tail is coiled and possesses a single
spicule in a protrusible sheath. The sheath bears an oblong swelling a
short distance from its distal extremity and is covered with minute spines,
which decrease in size towards the distal end. The female tail is merely
curved. The characteristic eggs are lemon shaped, 75 × 35 μm, with a
thick smooth shell and a conspicuous polar plug (operculum) at both ends;
in the faeces these eggs appear yellow or brown in colour.
Hosts: Sheep, goats, occasionally cattle and other ruminants
Life cycle: The infective stage is the L1 within the egg, which develops in
Under optimal conditions, these larvated eggs may subsequently survive
and remain viable for several years. After ingestion, the plugs are digested
and the released L1 penetrate the glands of the distal ileum, caecal and
colonic mucosa. Subsequently all four moults occur within these glands,
the adults emerging to lie on the mucosal surface with their anterior ends
embedded in the mucosa. The prepatent period is about 7-10 weeks.

Eimeria crandallis
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Hosts: Sheep
Description: Oocysts are subspherical to broadly ellipsoidal, 17-23 x
17-22 μm (21.9 × 19.4 μm), with a micropyle, which may be distinct or

two clear globules. Mature first-generation meronts are 250 μm in
diameter, and are visible to the naked eye as pin-point white spots,
1 x l  s  oo 
are mature by day 10. Second-generation meronts appear at day 10-12
after infection in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of the small intestine and
the caecum. Most lie at the base of the crypts and contain five to nine
 merozoites. Progamonts appear in the nuclei of the epithelial cells in the
crypts and villi of the jejunum, ileum and caecum at 1l-l6 days after
infection. The progamonts divide synchronously. By day 16, the
progamonts on the villi mature into gamonts, and enlarge and move into
the cytoplasm above the nucleus where they differentiate into macro and
microgamonts. The progamonts in the crypts mature from day 18. The
 prepatent period is 13-20 days and sporulation time is 1-3 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The pathogenic lesions are mainly in the caecum and colon
where gametogony of E. crandallis occurs. The lesions cause local
haemorrhage and oedema, and villous atrophy may be a sequel resulting in
malabsorption. Infection is particularly a problem in very young lambs,
491
especially if their immune status is poor or they have been colostrum
deprived. Light infections produce a very strong immunity.
Pathology: In heavily infected lambs at around 10 days after infection
there is whitish discoloration of the mucosa due to masses of
first-generation meronts, and this is apparent through the serosa. From the
onset of diarrhoea there is hyperaemia and thickening of the wall of the
small intestine, increasing in severity towards the caecum. Gamonts were
found in scrapings from these areas. In heavy infections, the caecum and
colon may be similarly affected. Histologically there is a leucocyte
infiltration with loss of villus epithelium associated with first- and
second-generation meronts in the small intestine. There is resulting villous
atrophy, and the crypt epithelium is also affected resulting in loss of
small intestine and the large intestine. Infected crypts are hyperplastic
with large, basophilic enterocytes and reduced goblet cell numbers.
Eimeriaovinoidalis
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Hosts: Sheep
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal, colourless or pale yellow, 17-30 x
doow snonidsuou ue s aau (ur l x bl uea) w bl1
without a micropylar cap. Two or more polar granules are present and
there is no residuum. Sporocysts are elongate 0void, 10-14 x 4-8 μm.
Each has a Stieda body and a residuum. The sporozoites are elongate,
1 1-14 x 2-4 μm and lie lengthwise head to tail in the sporocysts. Each has
one large and one small globule. First-generation meronts, at 10 days,
average 290 μm in diameter and contain many thousands of merozoites.
Second-generation meronts mature at about 10-l1 days and have a mean
diameter of 12 μm, each containing an average of 24 merozoites. The
mature microgamonts average 15 x 12 μm and contain many
microgametes arranged peripherally around a central residuum, whilst
mature macrogamonts average 16 x 12 μm.
492
Life cycle: Following ingestion of sporulated oocysts, eight sporozoites

Second-generation meronts lie in epithelial cells lining the crypts of the
large intestine, maturing 10-ll days after infection. From this last
schizont generation, merozoites emerge which give rise to the sexual
forms (gamonts), which in turn form oocysts that pass out in the faeces.
Once outside, the oocysts sporulate, i.e. they undergo two divisions to
produce four sporocysts, each containing two sporozoites. Only the
sporulated oocysts are infective. If ingested by a susceptible host, the
sporozoites emerge and start the cycle again. The prepatent period is

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The pathogenic lesions are mainly in the caecum and colon
where second-stage merogony and gametogony of E. ovinoidalis occur.

Clinical signs: Clinical signs for both E. crandailis and E. ovinoidalis are
lambs may not be thriving as expected. Several lambs may have a
their appetite and become weak and unthrifty. As the disease progresses,
some lambs show profuse watery diarrhoea, often containing streaks of
blood. If left untreated, these animals may continue to scour and
eventually die of dehydration.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on the management history, the age of the
lambs, postmortem lesions and faecal examination for oocysts. The latter
may be present in very large numbers in both healthy and diseased lambs
so that a necropsy is always advisable.
Epidemiology: In spring-lambing flocks in western Europe, infection of
lambs results both from oocysts, which have survived the winter and from
those produced by earlier born lambs. Lambs are usually affected between
4 and 8 weeks of age with a peak infection around 6 weeks. The outbreaks
reported have occurred where ewes and lambs were housed in unhygienic
conditions or grazed intensively. The feeding of concentrates in stationary
troughs, around which heavy contamination with oocysts has occurred,
can also be a precipitating factor. In the USA, coccidiosis occurs when
older lambs are confined in feedlots after weaning.
Treatment and control: Decoquinate and diclazuril are the drugs
generally used for the prevention and treatment of these infections.
Monensin and amprolium have also been used in some countries for
sulphamethoxypyridazine,   sulphadiazine,   sulphadoxine   and
All animals in a group should be treated and dehydrated animals may
require oral or intravenous rehydration. Where non-specific symptoms of
weight loss or ill-thrift are present, it is important to investigate all
 potential causes and seek laboratory confirmation. Good management and
hygiene practices, by regular moving of feed and water troughs, avoidance
of overcrowding and stress, batch rearing, feeding of dams prior to
 parturition, and creep feeding, will reduce the incidence of infection.

Eimeria ninakohlyakimovae
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Hosts: Goat
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal, thin-walled, colourless, 20-22 x
14-16 μm (mean 20.7 × 14.8 μm) without micropyle or micropylar cap
and with no 0ocyst residuum. Sporocysts are 0void, 9-15 × 4-10 μm, each
with a Stieda body and a sporocyst residuum. The sporozoites are
elongate, and lie lengthwise head to tail in the sporocysts, each with two
clear globules.
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically coccidian. The meronts, gamonts
and oocysts are in the epithelial cells of the ileum, caecum and upper large
days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: As for E. ovinoidalis in sheep
Eimeria caprina
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeridae
Hosts: Goat
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal or slightly ovoid, dark brown to
brownish yellow in colour, 27-40 × 19-26 μm with a smooth wall. There
is a micropyle but no micropylar cap or oocyst residuum. One or more
polar granules are present. Sporocysts are elongate 0void, 13-17 x 7-10
μm with a small Stieda body and a residuum. The sporozoites are
elongate, lie lengthwise head to tail in the sporocysts and usually have a
large clear globule at the large end and a smaller one at the small end.
495
Life cycle: Details of the life cycle are not known. The prepatent period is
  i     d   s
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: This species is considered pathogenic but lesions and
pathology have not been described in detail.
Clinical signs: The clinical signs for E. ninakohlyakimovae and E.
caprina are generally similar. Infection leads loss of appetite,
unthriftiness, profuse diarrhoea, often containing streaks of blood. If left
untreated, these animals may continue to scour and eventually die of
dehydration.
Epidemiology: Management factors associated with the development of
high levels of infection and the development of disease are overcrowding.
dirty conditions and repeat use of rearing pens for different age groups of
young goats. If the same pens are used constantly for successive batches,
or if young goats are added to a pen already housing older animals, then
the later born animals are immediately exposed to heavy challenge and
can show severe coccidiosis in the first few weeks of life. On heavily
stocked, overgrazed pastures levels of contamination may be high, leading
to disease.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on the management history, postmortem
lesions and faecal examination for oocysts.
coccidiosis in goats but sulphonamides, decoquinate or diclazuril may be
effective if disease is suspected. The incidence of infection can be reduced
through avoidance of overcrowding and stress, and attention to hygiene
Flagellateprotozoa
The life cycle of flagellate protozoa is similar for all species found in
sheep and goats. The trophozoites reproduce by longitudinal binary
fission. No sexual stages are known and there are no cysts. Transmission
is thought to occur by ingestion of trophozoites from faeces. All are
considered to be non-pathogenic and are generally only identified from
smears taken from the large intestine of fresh carcases.

Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
Description, adults: Greyish brown flies about 12 mm long, with small
black spots on the abdomen and a covering of short brown hairs (Figs
3.20, 3.21). The head is broad, with small eyes, and the frons, scutellum
and dorsal thorax bear small wart-like protuberances. The segments of the
antennae are small and the arista bare. The mouthparts are reduced to
small knobs.
Description, larvae: Mature larvae in the nasal passages are about 30 mm
long, yellow-white and tapering anteriorly. Each segment has a dark
transverse band dorsally (Fig. 3.22). They have large, black, oral hooks,
connected to an internal cephalopharyngeal skeleton. The ventral surface
bears rows of small spines.
Hosts: Primarily sheep and goat, but also ibex, camel and, occasionally,
humans
Life cycle: The females are viviparous and infect the sheep by squirting a
jet of liquid containing larvae at the nostrils during flight, which delivers

the mucus that is secreted in response to the stimulation of larval
movement. Larvae attach themselves to the mucous membrane using oral
hooks, which cause irritation. The first moult occurs in the nasal passages,
and the L2 crawl into the frontal sinuses where the final moult to L3 takes
place. [n the sinuses, the larvae complete their growth and then migrate
back to the nostrils, from where they are sneezed to the ground. Larvae
pupate in the ground and pupation lasts for between 3-9 weeks. The

active throughout the year, two or three generations are possible, but in
cool or cold weather the small L1 and L2 become dormant and remain in
recesses of the nasal passages over winter. They move to the frontal
sinuses only in the warmer spring weather, and then complete their
development into the L3, which emerge from the nostrils and pupate on
the ground to give a further generation of adults. The females survive only
2 weeks, but during this time each can deposit up to 500 larvae in the
nasal passages of sheep.
Geographical distribution: Although originally Palaearctic, it is now
found in all sheep-farming areas of the world, having been spread with
sheep as they were transported worldwide.
Pathogenesis: Most infections are light, with only an average of 2-20
larvae being present in the frontal sinus of infested animals at any one
time. Sheep show nasal discharge and sneezing, and rub their noses on
fixed objects. In the rare heavier infections, there is unthriftiness and
sheep may circle and show lack of coordination, these signs being termed
'false gid'. If a larva dies in the sinuses, there may be secondary bacterial
          
small cavities and are unable to leave when fully grown. Occasionally the
larvae may penetrate the bones of the skull and enter the cerebral cavity.
Changes in the nasal tissues of infected sheep include catarrh, infiltration
of inflammatory cells and squamous metaplasia, characterised by

The most important effects, however, are due to the activity of the adult
flies. When they approach sheep to deposit larvae the animals panic,
stamp their feet, bunch together and press their nostrils into each other's
fleeces and against the ground. There may be several attacks each day, so
that feeding is interrupted and animals may fail to gain weight.
Oestrus can occasionally also infect humans. Larvae are usually deposited
near the eyes, where a catarrhal conjunctivitis may result, or around the
lips, leading to a stomatitis. Such larvae never fully develop.
Clinical signs: Nasal discharge, rubbing, sneezing, unthriftiness, circling
and lack of coordination. Secondary bacterial infections are common.
Diagnosis: Although the clinical signs may assist in diagnosis,
infestations of Oestrus ovis must be differentiated from other conditions
with similar symptoms. Occasionally a larva may be found on the ground
after a severe sneezing attack, but often a positive diagnosis can only be
made atnecropsy.

induces a marked hypersensitivity reaction where there is an increase in
the numbers of serous mast cells and eosinophils and an increased
production of IgE. Interstitial pneumonia may develop during the course
of ovine oestrosis, marked by increases in the numbers of oesinophils and
mast cells in the lung parenchyma, mainly in the peribronchial region.

sensitisation.
Epidemiology: The adult flies occur from spring to autumn and are
particularly active during the summer months. However in warm climates
they may even be active in winter. In southern Europe, three generation
June-July and September-October. More commonly, however, there are
only two generations per year, with adults present in late spring and late
summer. Geographically, infestation prevalence tends to be highly
localised. The flies hide in warm corners and crevices and in the early
morning can be seen sitting on walls and objects in the sun.
Treatment: Where the numbers of larvae are small, it may not be
economically viable to treat. However, in heavy infections closantel,
nitroxynil, and the endectocides, ivermectin, doramectin and moxidectin.
are highly effective, as are the organophosphates trichlorphon and
dichlorvos.
Control: Should a control scheme be necessary it has been suggested by
South African workers that flock treatment should be given twice a year,
the first at the beginning of summer to kill newly acquired larvae, and the
second in midwinter to kill any overwintering larvae. Fly repellents may
be used but so far these have shownlimited success.
Gedoelstia spp
Predilection site: Nasopharynx
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
504
Description, adults: These are large, robust flies of up to 18 mm in

abdomen is brown with large black lateral patches and a series of large
tubercles with sharply pointed tips.
Description, larvae: The third-stage larvae are ovoid, up to 20 mm in
length and may be distinguished from all other oestrids by a vertical slit in
the posterior peritremes or a vertical suture if the spiracle is closed.
Hosts: Sheep, occasionally cattle, horses and antelope
Life cycle: The larvae are deposited by the adult flies in the orbit of the
natural hosts, which are antelopes, and travel by a vascular route to the
nasopharynx where they mature, thus showing some affinity with
Cephenemyia. Some larvae appear to include the lungs in this migration.
Geographical distribution: Southern Africa
Pathogenesis: In the normal wildlife hosts, larvae appear to cause little
pathological damage, although there are reports of loss of coordination.
The infection becomes of veterinary importance when domestic ruminants
are grazed close to, or among, the wild hosts. In sheep the larvae usually
and arresting eventually in the brain, ocular tissues, nasal cavities or heart.
It is in the eye that the signs are most prominent, with glaucoma, extrusion
and even rupture of the eyeball.
Clinical signs: In southern Africa this oestrid fly is responsible for an
oculo-vascular myiasis, causing extrusion of the eyeball in sheep and,
rarely,cattle.
Diagnosis: First-stage larvae may occasionally be observed on the cornea,
Pathology: In domestic hosts three main forms of infestation are
distinguished: ophthalmic, encephalitic and cardiac, characterised by
thrombo-endophlebitis and  thrombo-encarditis with encephalomalacia,
from vascular thrombosis. Myocardial, pulmonary and renal infarction
may also occur.
505
Epidemiology: Flocks may have a 30% morbidity, of which a third will
die, and in some areas sheep farming has had to be abandoned and
replaced by cattle farming because of this parasite.
Treatment: Organophosphates such as trichlorphon are effective against
the larvae, and flock treatment will reduce the blindness and mortality.
Topical application of 0.25% cypermethrin spray to the eye has been used
effectively to kill first-stage larvae.
Control: Domestic stock can safely graze with antelope during winter,
when the flies are inactive (June-August). They should be removed from
such areas in early spring when flies begin to emerge from puparia with
the rising temperature.
Dictyocaulus filaria
Common name: Sheep lungworm
Predilection site: Lungs
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The worms are white with the intestine visible as a
dark band. Males measure around 4-8 cm and the females 6-10 cm in
length.
Description, microscopic: The L1 resembles D. vivivparus but has a
characteristic cuticular knob at the anterior extremity.
Hosts: Sheep, goat and a few wild ruminants

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Similar to that of D. viviparus, infection leading to a
catarrhal bronchitis. However, since the number of lungworms in
individual animals is generally low (Fig. 3.24), the widespread lesions
associated with the bovine infection are not common.
Clinical signs: The most common signs are coughing and unthriftiness
which, in endemic areas, is usually confined to young animals. In more
severe cases, dyspnoea, tachypnoea and a tenacious nasal discharge are
also present. These signs may be accompanied by diarrhoea or anaemia
due to concurrent gastrointestinal trichostrongylosis or fasciolosis.
Diagnosis: This is based on history and clinical signs, but should be
confirmed by examination of fresh faeces taken from a large proportion of
the flock. The L1 resembles that of D. viviparus, but has a characteristic
intestinal cells. It is differentiated from other ovine lungworms by its
larger size and blunt-ended tail (Fig. 3.23a).

occur and the lung surface may be studded with purulent areas of
sec ondary bacterial infection.
Epidemiology: Although this parasite is prevalent worldwide, it is only
responsible for sporadic outbreaks of disease in temperate countries such
as the UK and North America. It occurs more frequently as a clinical
East and India.
In temperate areas the epidemiology is similar to that of D.viviparus in
that both the survival of overwintered larvae on pasture and the role of the
ewe and doe as a carrier are significant factors in the persistence of
that the parasites are present largely as hypobiotic larvae in the lungs
during each winter and mature in the spring. Development to the L3 only
occurs during the period from spring to autumn. In lambs and kids, patent

usually seen in autumn. The prevalence of infection is lower in adult
animals and their larval output smaller. Infective L3 can migrate from the
faeces without the need for fungal dispersion. It is likely that only two
cycles of the parasite occur during each grazing season.
[n warmer climates, where conditions are often unsuitable for larval
survival, the carrier animal is probably a more important source of pasture
contamination and outbreaks of disease in young susceptible animals are

disseminate infection when both are grazed together.
Treatment: Where sporadic outbreaks occur, the affected animals, or
preferably the whole flock, should be gathered, treated with a suitable
anthelmintic (see Dictyocauius viviparus) and then, if possible, moved to
fresh pasture.  The prophylactic regimens of control  currently
recommended for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep will
in normal years, be effective to a large extent in suppressing D. filaria
infection.
Control: Where it is necessary to apply specific control measures, it is
suggested that the flock should be annually treated with a suitable
anthelmintic in late pregnancy. The ewes and lambs should then be grazed
on pasture, which, in temperate areas at least, should not have been used
by sheep during the previous year.
Notes: This species, the most important lungworm of sheep and goats, is
commonly associated with a chronic syndrome of coughing and
unthriftiness, which usually affects lambs and kids.
Protostrongylus rufescens
Common name: Red lungworm
Predilection site: Small bronchioles
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Metastrongyloidea
Description, gross: Adult worms are slender, reddish worms (male up to
4.5 cm; female up to 6.5 cm)
Description, microscopic: In the male, the bursa is well developed but
small. The dorsal ray is globular in shape with six papillae on the ventral
membraneous alae. The gubernaculum has two bootshaped prolongations
bearing several knobs posteriorly. In the female, the vulva is close to the
 go Po si in o  e s l s a  Po
dorsal spine (Fig. 3.23b).
509
Definitive hosts: Sheep, goat, deer and wild small ruminants
Intermediate hosts: Snails (Helicella,Theba,Abida,Zebrina,Arianta)
Life cycle: The worms are ovo-viviparous, the L1 being passed in the
faeces: these penetrate the foot of the molluscan intermediate host, and
             
infected by ingesting the mollusc. The L3, freed by digestion, travel to the
lungs by the lymphatic-vascular route, the parasitic moults occurring in
the mesenteric lymph nodes and lungs. The prepatent period of
Protostrongylus is 5-6 weeks. The period of patency is very long,
exceeding2years.
Geographical distribution: Europe, Africa, Australia, North America
Pathogenesis: The worms live in the small bronchioles, where they
produce an irritation and local areas of inflammation develop leading to a
small foci of lobular pneumonia. The number of nodules on the lung
surface may relate to the intensity of infection.
Clinical signs: Pneumonic signs have rarely been observed, and infections
are almost always inapparent, being identified only at necropsy.
Diagnosis: The presence of infection is usually noted only during routine
faecal examination. The L1 are first differentiated from those of
Dictyocaulus filaria by the absence of an anterior protoplasmic knob, and
then on the individual characters of the larval tail (Fig. 3.23b)
Pathology: In Protostrongylus infection there is a somewhat larger area of
lung involvement than with Mueiierius, the occlusion of small bronchioles
by worms, resulting in their lesser branches that occur toward the lung
surface being filled with eggs, larvae and cellular debris. The affected
alveolar and bronchial epithelium is desquamated, blood vessels are
occluded and cellular infiltration and proliferation of connective tissue
occurs. This results in a small area of lobular pneumonia and the
grey-yellowish lesion has a roughly conical form, with the base on the
surface of the lung-
Epidemiology: Protostrongyius, whose intermediate host range is
restricted to certain species of snail, has a lower prevalence, though its
geographic range is just as wide as Muellerius. Additional factors which
play a part in ensuring the endemicity of these worms are, first, the ability
510
of the L1 to survive for months in faecal pellets and secondly, the
persistence of the L3 in the intermediate host for the lifetime of the
mollusc. Also important in this respect are the long periods of patency and
the apparent inability of the final host to develop acquired immunity, so
that adult sheep have the heaviest infections and the highest prevalence.
Treatment: The modern benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin have
been shown to be effective. However, higher dose rates or repeated
treatments may be necessary for high efficacy.
Control: Because of the ubiquity of the molluscan intermediate hosts, and
the fact that the L3 can survive as long as the molluscs, specific control is
difficult, but fortunately rarely necessary. In some enterprises it may be
 practical to reduce snail numbers through the limeing of pastures.
Notes: These worms all inhabit the lungs, but none is a major pathogen
and, though common, they are of little economic importance compared
with the other helminth parasites of sheep and goats. Although there are
several different genera they are sufficiently similar in behaviour to be
considered together.

Definitive hosts: Sheep, goat, deer and wild small ruminants
Intermediate hosts: Snails (Helix, Succinea) and slugs (Limax,
Agriolimax,Arion)
Life cycle: The life cycle is indirect. The worms are ovo-viviparous, the
L1 being passed in the faeces: these penetrate the foot of the molluscan
intermediate host, and develop to L3 in a minimum period of 2-3 weeks.
The sheep or goat is infected by ingesting the mollusc. The L3, freed by
digestion, travel to the lungs by the lymphatic-vascular route, the parasitic
moults occurring in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lungs. The prepatent
period of Muellerius is 6-10 weeks. The period of patency is very long,
exceeding 2 years.
regions
Pathogenesis: Although there can be extensive emphysemic nodules,
pneumonic signs have rarely been observed, and infections are usually
inapparent, being identified only at necropsy. Sometimes mild infections
are accompanied by sporadic coughing. Heavy infections may predispose
the lungs to secondary bacterial infection. In goats, heavy infection with
M. capillaris can induce coughing and dyspnoea and occasionally
pneumonia.
Clinical signs: Generally asymptomatic but occasional coughing and
dyspnoea in heavy infections
Diagnosis: The presence of infection is usually noted only during routine
faecal examination. The L1 are first differentiated from those of
Dictyocaulus filaria by the absence of an anterior protoplasmic knob, and

nodular focal lesions, that occur most commonly near, or on, the lung
surface, and on palpation have the feel and size of lead shot. Nodules
containing single worms are almost imperceptible, and the visible ones
enclose several of the tiny worms as well as eggs and larvae. Occasionally
larger greyish nodules, up to 2 cm in diameter, are apparent and
sometimes the nodules are calciffied. The nodules consist of necrotic
masses, resulting from the degeneration of accumulated leucocytes and
pulmonary tissue, and they are surrounded by connective tissue and
occasional giant cells. Adjoining pulmonary tissue may be hyperaemic
and the alveoli become filled with cells and debris.
Epidemiology: Muellerius is by far the commonest genus of sheep
lungworm, and in many temperate areas such as Britain, the eastern states
of the USA and the winter rainfall regions of Australia, almost all sheep
partly attributable to its wide range of intermediate hosts and the ability of
larvae to overwinter in the molluscs. Prevalence of infection tends to
increase with age. Additional factors which play a part in ensuring the
endemicity of these worms are, first, the ability of the L1 to survive for
months in faecal pellets and secondly, the persistence of the L3 in the
intermediate host for the lifetime of the mollusc. Also important in this
respect are the long periods of patency and the apparent inability of the
final host to develop acquired immunity, so that adult sheep have the
heaviest infections and the highest prevalence. Wild small ruminants are
frequently heavily infected and could transmit protostrongylids to grazing
sheep and goats under some management systems.

Description, gross: *Hydatid’ cysts are large fluid-filled vesicles, 5-10
cm in diameter, with a thick concentrically laminated cuticle and an
internal germinal layer.
Description, microscopic: The germinal layer produces numerous small
vesicles or brood capsules each containing up to 40 scolices, invaginated
into their neck portions and attached to the wall by stalks. Brood capsules
may become detached from the wall of the vesicle and float freely in the
vesicular fluid and form *hydatid sand'
Final hosts: Dog and many wild canids
Intermediate hosts: Domestic and wild ruminants, man and primates, pig
and lagomorphs, horses and donkeys are resistant
Life cycle: The prepatent period in the final host is around 40-50 days,
after which only one gravid segment is shed per week. The oncospheres
are capable of prolonged survival outside the host, being viable on the
oncosphere penetrates the gut wall and travels in the blood to the liver, or
in the lymph to the lungs. These are the two commonest sites for larval
development, but occasionally oncospheres escape into the general
systemic circulation and develop in other organs and tissues. Growth of
the hydatid is slow, maturity being reached in 6-12 months. In the liver
and lungs the cyst may have a diameter of up 20 cm, but in the rarer sites,
such as the abdominal cavity, where unrestricted growth is possible, it
may be very large, and contain several litres of fluid. The cyst capsule

which, when cyst growth is almost complete, brood capsules each
containing a number of scolices are budded off. Many of these brood
capsules become detached and exist free in the hydatid fluid; collectively
these and the scolices are often referred to as “hydatid sand'. Sometimes,
complete daughter cysts are formed either inside the mother cyst or
   s           
to form new hydatids.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: In domestic animals the hydatid in the liver or lungs (Figs
3.25, 3.26) is usually tolerated without any clinical signs, and the majority

[n contrast, when man is involved as an intermediate host the hydatid in its
pulmonary or hepatic site is often of pathogenic significance. One or both
lungs may be affected causing respiratory symptoms, and if several

person survives, released daughter cysts may resume development in other
regions of the body.
Clinical signs: Infection in cattle or sheep is generally not associated with
clinical signs. Human infection can result in respiratory distress or
infected.
Diagnosis: The presence of hydatids as a clinical entity is rarely suspected
in domestic animals, and specific diagnosis is never called for.
Pathology: In sheep, about 70% of hydatids occur in the lungs, about 25%
in the liver, and the remainder in other organs.
Epidemiology: Only a few countries, notably Iceland and Eire, are free
from this strain of E. granulosus. It is customary to consider the
feeding of ruminant offal containing hydatid cysts. The domestic
intermediate host will vary according to the local husbandry but the most
important is the sheep, which appears to be the natural intermediate host,
scolices from these animals being the most highly infective for dogs. In
parts of the Middle East the camel is the main reservoir of hydatids, while
in northern Europe and northern Russia it is the reindeer. The pastoral

Treatment:No treatment in sheep
519
Control: This is based on the regular treatment of dogs to eliminate the
adult tapeworms and on the prevention of infection in dogs by exclusion
from their diet of animal material containing hydatids. This is achieved by
denying dogs access to abattoirs, and, where possible, by proper disposal
supported by legislation, with penalties when they are disregarded. [n
countries where no specific measures for hydatid control exist, it has been
found that an incidental benefit from the destruction of stray dogs for
rabies control has been a great reduction in the incidence of hydatid
infection inhumans.

livestock intermediate hosts. The dog-sheep cycle is infective to man.
Less dominant is the 'northern’ biotype that involves the wolf-reindeer or
wolf-moose cycles and is not considered a danger to man.
There are two major strains of E. granulosus in domestic animals, namely
E. granulosus granulosus and E. granulosus equinus (see Chapter 4:

Life cycle: Adult flukes in the bile ducts shed eggs into the bile, which
enter the intestine. Eggs passed in the faeces of the mammalian host
develop and hatch, releasing motile ciliated miracidia. This takes 9-10
days at optimal temperatures of 22-26°C and little development occurs
below 10°C. The liberated miracidium has a short lifespan and must locate
is to occur. In infected snails, development proceeds through the sporocyst
and redial stages to the final stage in the intermediate host, the cercaria;
these are shed from the snail as motile forms, which attach themselves to
firm surfaces, such as grass blades, and encyst there to form the infective
metacercariae. It takes a minimum of 6-7 weeks for completion of
development  from  miracidium  to metacercaria,  although  under
unfavourable circumstances a period of several months is required.
[nfection of a snail with one miracidium can produce over 600
s          
intestine, migrate through the gut wall, cross the peritoneum and penetrate
the liver capsule. The young flukes tunnel through the liver parenchyma
for 6-8 weeks, then enter the small bile ducts where they migrate to the
larger ducts and occasionally the gall bladder and reach sexual maturity.
The prepatent period is 10-12 weeks. The minimal period for completion
of one entire life cycle of F. hepatica is therefore 17-18 weeks (Fig. 3.27).
The longevity of F. hepatica in untreated sheep may be years; in cattle it
is usually less than l year.

Pathogenesis: This varies according to the number of metacercariae
ingested, the phase of parasitic development in the liver and the species of
host involved. Essentially the pathogenesis is two-fold. The first phase
 occurs during migration in the liver parenchyma and is associated with
liver damage and haemorrhage. The second occurs when the parasite is in
the bile ducts, and results from the haematophagic activity of the adult
flukes and from damage to the biliary mucosa by their cuticular spines.
Most studies have been in sheep and the disease in this host is discussed in
detail. The seasonality of outbreaks is that which occurs in western
Europe.
Fasciolosis in sheep may be acute, sub-acute or chronic.
523
The acute disease is the less common type of fasciolosis and occurs 2-6
weeks after the ingestion of large numbers of metacercariae, usually over
2000, and is due to extensive destruction of the liver parenchyma and the
severe haemorrhage which results when the young flukes, simultaneously
migrating in the liver parenchyma, rupture blood vessels. Damage to the
liver parenchyma is also severe. Outbreaks of acute fasciolosis are
generally presented as sudden deaths during autumn and early winter. On
examination of the remainder of the flock, affected animals are weak, with
pale mucous membranes and dyspnoea; in some instances they have
palpably enlarged livers associated with abdominal pain and ascites.
Sometimes these outbreaks are complicated by concurrent infections with
Clostridium novyi resulting in clostridial necrotic hepatitis ^black disease'
although this is less common nowadays because of widespread
vaccination against clostridial diseases.
In the subacute disease, metacercariae are ingested over a longer period
and while some have reached the bile ducts, where they cause a
cholangitis, others are still migrating through the liver parenchyma
causing lesions less severe, but similar, to those of the acute disease; thus
the liver is enlarged with numerous necrotic or haemorrhagic tracts visible
on the surface and in the substance. Subcapsular haemorrhages are usually
evident, but rupture of these is rare.
This form of the disease, occurring 6-l0 weeks after ingestion of
approximately 500-1500 metacercariae, also appears in the late autumn
and winter. It is presented as a rapid and severe haemorrhagic anaemia
with hypoalbuminaemia, and, if untreated, can result in a high mortality
rate. However it is not so rapidly fatal as the acute condition and affected
sheep may show clinical signs for 1-2 weeks prior to death; these include
a rapid loss of condition, reduced appetite, a marked pallor of the mucous
membranes, and an enlarged and palpable liver. Submandibular or facial
Oedema and ascites may be present.
Chronic fasciolosis, which is seen mainly in late winter/early spring, is
the most common form of the disease. It occurs 4-5 months after the
ingestion of moderate numbers, 200-500, of metacercariae. The principal
         
ml blood per fluke can be lost into the bile ducts each day. Additional loss
of plasma proteins occurs by leakage through the hyperplastic biliary
mucosa and the pathogenic effect is exacerbated if the sheep is on a low
524
plane of nutrition. Clinically, chronic fasciolosis is characterised by a
progressive loss of condition, lowered appetite and the development of
anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia, which can result in emaciation, an open
brittle fleece, pallor of the mucous membranes, submandibular oedema
(bottle-jaw') and ascites. The anaemia is hypochromic and macrocytic
with an accompanying eosinophilia. Fasciola eggs can be demonstrated in
the faeces. In light infections, the clinical effect may not be readily
discernible, but the parasites can have a significant effect on production
due to an impairment of appetite and to their effect on post-absorptive
metabolism of protein, carbohydrates and minerals. There is no evidence
for any significant age immunity or acquired resistance to F. hepatica
infection in sheep.
Clinical signs: Outbreaks of acute fasciolosis in sheep are generally
presented as sudden deaths during autumn and early winter. On
examination of the remainder of the flock, affected animals are weak, with
pale mucous membranes and dyspnoea; in some instances they will have
palpably enlarged livers associated with abdominal pain and ascites.

discernible, but the parasites can have a significant effect on production

Diagnosis: This is based primarily on clinical signs, seasonal occurrence,
prevailing weather patterns, and a previous history of fasciolosis on the
farm or the identification of snail habitats. Diagnosis of ovine fasciolosis
should present few problems, especially when a postmortem examination
is possible. Routine haematological tests and examination of faeces for
fluke eggs (note: eggs of Fasciola are brown-yellow and eggs of
Paramphistomidae are colourless) are useful and may be supplemented by
twootherlaboratorytests.
The first is the estimation of plasma levels of enzymes released by
damaged liver cells. Two enzymes are usually measured. Glutamate
525
dehydrogenase (GLDH) is released when parenchymal cells are damaged
           
other, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) indicates damage to the
epithelial cells lining the bile ducts; elevation of this enzyme takes place
mainly after the flukes reach the bile ducts and raised levels are
maintained for a longer period. The second is the detection of antibodies
against components of flukes in serum or milk samples, the ELISA and
the passive haemagglutination test being the most reliable.

enlarged, friable, haemorrhagic and honeycombed with the tracts of
migrating flukes (Fig. 3.28). The surface, particularly over the ventral
lobe, is frequently covered with a fibrinous exudate. Subcapsular
haemorrhages are common and these may rupture so that a quantity of
blood-stained fluid is often present in the abdominal cavity (Fig. 3.29). [n
the subacute form, the liver is enlarged with numerous necrotic or
haemorrhagic tracts visible on the surface and in the substance.
Subcapsular haemorrhages are usually evident, but rupture of these is rare.
[n the chronic form, the liver has an irregular outline and is pale and firm,
the ventral lobe being most affected and reduced in size. The liver
pathology is characterised by hepatic fibrosis and hyperplastic cholangitis.
Several different types of fibrosis are present. The first to occur is
post-necrotic scarring found mainly in the ventral lobe and associated with
the healing of fluke tracts. The second, often termed ischaemic fibrosis, is
526
a sequel of infarction caused by damage and thrombosis of large vessels.
Thirdly, a peribiliary fibrosis develops when the flukes reach the small
bile ducts. Sometimes fluke eggs provoke a granulomalike reaction, which
can result in obliteration of the affected bile ducts. The hyperplastic

the large numbers of metacercariae necessary for outbreaks of fasciolosis.
1. Availability of suitable snail habitats: L. truncatula prefers wet
mud to free water, and permanent habitats include the banks of
ditches or streams and the edges of small ponds. Following heavy
rainfall or flooding, temporary habitats may be provided by hoof
marks, wheel ruts or rain ponds. Fields with clumps of rushes are
often suspect sites. Though a slightly acid pH environment is
optimal for L. truncatula, excessively acid pH levels are
detrimental, such as occur in peat bogs, and areas of sphagnum
moss.
2. Temperature: A mean day/night temperature of 10°C or above is
the minimum range for the development and hatching of F.
hepatica eggs. However, it is only when temperatures rise to 15°℃
of snails and fluke larval stages ensues.
3. Moisture: The ideal moisture conditions for snail breeding and
the development of F. hepatica within snails are provided when
rainfall exceeds transpiration, and field saturation is attained. Such
conditions are also essential for the development of fluke eggs, for
miracidia searching for snails and for the dispersal of cercariae
being shed from the snails.

from May to October. A marked increase in numbers of metacercariae on
pasture is therefore possible during two periods. First, from what is known
as the summer infection of snails, in which metacercariae appear on
pasture from August to October (Fig. 3.30). These snail infections arise
  a s    r e  
spring/early summer by infected animals, or from eggs, which have
survived the winter in an undeveloped state. Development in the snail
occurs during the summer and the cercariae are shed from August until
October. Secondly, from the winter infection of snails in which
metacercariae appear on the pasture in May to June (Fig. 3.31). These are
which larval development had temporarily ceased during the period of
winter hibernation of the snail host and had recommenced in the spring.
Both F. hepatica eggs and metacercariae can survive over the winter and
          
miracidia in late spring, can infect snails. The metacercariae, by infecting
stock in early spring, result in eggs being available by mid-summer at the
optimal snail breeding season. However, survival of metacercariae is poor

In most European countries, the summer infection of snails is the more
important and an increase in the numbers of metacercariae occurs annually
   t  s go      
when summer rainfall is heavy. The winter infection of snails is much less
important, but occasionally gives rise to large numbers of metacercariae in
late spring and early summer, particularly when the preceding months
have been unduly wet.
Circulating antibodies to F. hepatica are readily detectable in sheep, but
there is no evidence that, under field conditions, sheep ever become
 go s a u    e   
the flukes will live as long as the sheep. Severe outbreaks of ovine
fasciolosis frequently involve adult sheep which have been previously
exposed to infection. In contrast, although outbreaks do occur in young
cattle, more usually an acquired immunity gradually develops; this limits
the lifespan of the primary infection, slows the migration of secondary
infection and eventually reduces the numbers of flukes established. Thus,
in endemic areas, adult cattle often appear unaffected clinically whereas
530
should be remembered that F. hepatica can infect a wide range of
mammals, including horses, donkeys, deer, pigs and rabbits, and it is
possible that on occasions these hosts may act as reservoirs of infection.
Man may also become infected, especially from the consumption of
watercress from unfenced beds.
Most of the above comments on the ecology of L. truncatula also apply to
the other amphibian species of Lymnaea, which transmit the parasite.

there is a second wave of metacercarial production derived from new
generations of snails. L. tormentosa can extend its range by floating/
drifting on water currents.
There is some evidence that the prevalence of fasciolosis in hot countries
is higher after several months of drought, possibly because the animals
congregate around areas of water conservation and so the chances of
snails becoming infected are increased.
Since L. truncatula is the most widespread and important species involved
in the transmission of F. hepatica, it is discussed in detail. L. truncatula is
531
a small snail, the adults being about 1.0 cm in length. The shell is usually
whorls. When held with the turret upright and the aperture facing the
observer, the latter is approximately half the length of the snail and is on
the right-hand side, and there are 4.5 whorls. The snails are amphibious
and although they spend hours in shallow water, they periodically emerge
on to surrounding mud. They commonly inhabit drainage ditches and
poorly drained land. They are capable of withstanding summer drought or
winter freezing for severalmonths by respectively aestivating Or
hibernating deep in the mud. Optimal conditions include a slightly acid pH
environment and a slowly moving water medium to carry away waste
products. They feed mostly on algae and the optimum temperature range
for development is 15-22°C; below 5°C development ceases. In Britain
for example, snails breed continuously from May to October, one snail
being capable of producing up to 100 000 descendants over 3 months.
hexachlorethane and hexachlorophene, may still be used in some
countries, but these have been largely replaced by more efficient and less
toxic compounds and only the latter will be discussed.
· Acute ovine fasciolosis. Until recently, treatment was not highly
successful due to the inefficiency of the older drugs against the
early parenchymal stages. However, efficient drugs are now
available and the one of choice is triclabendazole, which removes
all developing stages over 1 week old. Other drugs are closantel
and nitroxynil, which will remove flukes over 4 weeks old. A single
        
pasture or a well drained, recently cultivated field should be
adequate treatment. However with closantel or nitroxynil a second
         
ground. Where sheep cannot be moved to clean ground, treatment
should be repeated at 3-weekly intervals until 6 weeks after deaths
have ceased.
· Subacute ovine fasciolosis. The drugs recommended for acute
fasciolosis can be used against older flukes responsible for subacute
fasciolosis. Movement to fluke-free pasture is again advisable
following treatment, and where this is not possible treatment should
be repeated at 4 and 8 weeks to eliminate maturing flukes. [n
532
addition to the above drugs, brotianide (available in some
countries) is also effective.
· Chronic ovine fasciolosis. Outbreaks of chronic fasciolosis can be
successfully treated with a single dose of any of a range of drugs
(nitroxynil, brotianide, closantel, oxyclozanide and triclabendazole)
and following treatment, the anaemia usually regresses within 2-3
weeks. The roundworm anthelmintics, albendazole, ricobendazole
and netobimin are also effective against adult flukes albeit at
increased dosage rates.
Frequent treatment with flukicides which belong to the same chemical
group, or with the same anthelmintic season after season, could enhance
the possibility of development of drug-resistant flukes. It is advisable to

reducing populations of the intermediate snail host or by using
anthelmintics.
1. Reduction of snail populations. Before any scheme of snail
control is undertaken a survey of the area for snail habitats should
be made to determine whether these are localised or widespread.
The best long-term method of reducing mud-snail populations such
as L. truncatuia is drainage, since it ensures permanent destruction
of snail habitats. However, farmers are often hesitant to undertake
expensive drainage schemes, although in some countries special
drainage grants are available. When the snail habitat is limited a
simple method of control is to fence off this area or treat annually
with a molluscicide. Copper sulphate is the most widely used;
although more efficient molluscicides, such as N-trityl morpholine,
have been developed, none are generally available. In Europe,
experimental evidence indicates that a molluscicide should be
the commencement of breeding, or in summer (July/August) to kill
infected snails. The spring application should ensure better contact
often impractical because the saturated nature of the habitat makes
vehicular access difficult. In the summer this is less of a problem
although molluscicide/snail contact may be reduced because of the
533
increase in herbage growth. The application of a molluscicide
should be combined with anthelmintic treatment to remove existing
fluke populations and thus the contamination of habitats with eggs.
When the intermediate snail host is aquatic, such as L. tomentosa,
good control is possible by adding a molluscicide, such as N-trityl
morpholine or niclosamide, to the water habitat of the snail, but
there are many environmental objections to the use of molluscicides
in water or irrigation channels and rapid recolonisation of snail
habitats can occ ur.
2.Use of anthelmintics.The prophylactic use of fluke
anthelmintics is aimed at:

i. In late April/early May treat all adult sheep with a drug
effective against adult stages. At this time, products
containing both a fasciolicide and a drug effective
against nematodes which contribute to the periparturient
rise (PPR) in faecal egg counts in ewes may be used.
il. In October, treat the entire flock using a drug effective
against parenchymal stages, such as triclabendazole or
closantel.
ilil. In January, treat the flock with any drug effective
against immature and adult stages.
iv. In wet years further doses may be nesessary. In June,
4-6 weeks after the April/May dose, all adult sheep
should be treated with a drug effective against adult and
late immature flukes. In October/November, 4 weeks
after the early October dose, treat all sheep with a drug
effective against parenchymal stages.
534
v. The precise timing of the spring and autumn
treatments will depend on lambing and service dates.
3. Meteorological forecasting of fasciolosis. The life cycle of the
liver fluke and the prevalence of fasciolosis are dependent on
climate. This has led to the development of forecasting systems,
based on meteorological data, which estimate the likely timing and
severity of the disease. In several western European countries, these
forecasts are used as the basis for annual control programmes. Two
different formulae have been developed:
i. Estimatation of 'ground surface wetness', which is the critical
factor affecting the summer infection of snails. The formula is
M = n(R - P + 5) where M is the month, R is the monthly
rainfall in inches, P is the evapotranspiration in inches and n is
the number of wet days per month. A value of 100 or more per
month is optimal for parasite development and therefore values
of more than 100 are registered as 100. The formula is applied
breeding and parasite development, ie. May-October in
Europe, and the monthly values summated to give a seasonal
index or Mt value. Since the temperatures are generally lower
in May and October, the values for these months are halved
prior to summation. Where the Mt exceeds 450, the prevalence
of fasciolosis is likely to be high. The forecast is used to issue
          
shedding of cercariae. The disadvantage of the forecast is that it
may overestimate the prevalence where there is an autumn
drought or underestimate the likely prevalence where the
presence of drainage ditches allows the parasite life cycle to be
maintained in dry summers. Although this technique is mainly
applied to the summer infection of snails, it is also used for
forecasting the winter infection of snails by summating the
values for August, September and October; if these exceed 250
and the following May or June has a high rainfall then
fasciolosis is forecast for the area.
ii.“Wet day” forecast. This compares the prevalence of
fasciolosis over a number of years with the number of rain-days
during the summers of these years. In essence, widespread
fasciolosis is associated with 12 wet days (over 1.0 mm of
535
rainfall) per month from June to September where temperatures
do not fall below the seasonal normal. Computer-based forecast
systems have also been developed.

538
Life cycle: The egg does not hatch until ingested by the first intermediate
host, a terrestrial snail, in which two generations of sporocysts develop
which then produce cercariae. The latter are extruded in masses cemented
together by slime and adhere to vegetation. This phase of development
takes at least 3 months. The slime balls of cercariae are ingested by ants in
which they develop to metacercariae mainly in the body cavity and
occasionally the brain. The presence of a brain lesion in the ant, induced
by metacercariae, impels the ant to climb up and remain on the tips of the
herbage, thus increasing the chance of ingestion by the final host. This
phase in the ant is completed in just over 1 month in summer
containing metacercariae. The metacercariae hatch in the small intestine
and the young flukes migrate up the main bile duct and thence to the
smaller ducts in the liver. There is no parenchymal migration and the
prepatent period is 10-12 weeks. The total life cycle takes approximately
6 months. The flukes are long-lived and can survive in the final host for
several years.

found in the bile ducts, the livers are relatively normal; this is presumably
due to the absence of a migratory phase. However, in heavier infections
there is fibrosis of the smaller bile ducts and extensive cirrhosis can occur
and sometimes the bile ducts become markedly distended. Condemnation
of livers at slaughter may cause severe economic losses among cattle
herds and sheep flocks.

Epidemiology: There are two important features that differentiate the
epidemiology of Dicrocoelium from that of Fasciola:
1. The intermediate hosts are independent of water and are evenly
distributed on the terrain.
2. The egg can survive for months on dry pasture, presenting a
reservoir additional to that in the intermediate and final hosts.

Treatment: Many flukicides show no activity against D. dendriticum
when administered at the recommended fluke dose rates. Netobimin has
been shown to be highly effective at a dose rate of 20 mg/kg.
Albendazole, given at 20 mg/kg, is very effective, as is praziquantel at 50
mg/kg. Other drugs such fenbendazole are also effective, but at very high
dose rates (50 mg/kg).

Control: This is difficult because of the longevity of D. dendriticum eggs,
the wide distribution of the intermediate hosts and the number of reservoir
hosts. Control depends almost entirely on regular anthelmintic treatment.

Life cycle: The life cycle is not known but probably involves orabatid
mites.
Geographical distribution: Africa and Asia
Clinical signs: Infection is usually asymptomatic.
Diagnosis: Identification of eggs or proglottids in the faeces
Pathogenesis: Generally considered to be of low pathogenicity.

Epidemiology: S. hepatica is very common in sheep and other ruminants.
Treatment and control: Treatment is rarely called for, but praziquantel
has proved effective.

Taenia hydatigena (metacestode)
Synonym: Taenia marginata, Cysticercus tenuicollis
Predilection site: Abdominal cavity, liver (intermediate hosts); small
intestine (definitive hosts)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: The mature metacestode (cysticercus tenuicollis) is
about 5-8 cm in diameter and contains a single invaginated scolex
(bladderworm) with a long neck.
Final hosts: Dog, fox, weasel, stoat, polecat, wolf, hyena
Intermediate hosts: Sheep, cattle, deer, pig, horse

peritoneum. Within a further 4 weeks each develops into the
characteristically large metacestode, Cysticercus tenuicollis.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Heavy infections in young lambs can lead to hepatitis and
death. Occasionally, also, the developing cysticerci are killed in the liver,
subcapsular surface of the liver is studded with greenish nodules of around
I cm in diameter.
Fig. 3.33 Hepatitis cysticercosa caused by massive infection with
Cysticercus tenuicollis.
Severe infection of the liver or tissues may result in liver/carcase
condemnation at slaughter. The mature cysticerci in the peritoneal cavity
are usually benign. Concomitant immunity can occur in the intermediate
host allowing metacestodes, acquired from a primary infection, to survive
in the host, although the host is resistant to reinfection. Infrequently, large
numbers of developing cysticerci migrate contemporaneously in the liver
gross pathology resembles acute fascioliosis, and which is often fatal (Fig.
3.33)
Clinical signs: Loss of condition, emaciation and ascites may be present.
543
Diagnosis: Chronic infection in sheep is usually confirmed at meat
inspection where the large larval cysts are observed on the mesentery,
omentum and abdominal organs. The liver of animals that have died as a
result of acute infestation may contain haemorrhagic tracts and developing
metacestodes.
Pathology: The main lesions are seen in the liver, which has a number of
dark red foci and streaking and young cysticerci may be found in
migratory tracts. Metacestode stages are frequently found attached to the
omentum, intestinal mesentery and to the serosal surface of abdominal
organs, especially the liver in the intermediate ruminant hosts (Fig. 3.34).

and reindeer cycle exists in northern latitudes in which the metacestodes
are found in the liver of the intermediate host and dogs can be infected as
definitivehosts.

Treatment: No practical treatment is available for the intermediate host.
Control: This is similar to that of other taeniids involving control of
infection in the definitive host and through the burial or disposal of
ruminant carcases andoffal.

Notes: The correct nomenclature for the intermediate host stage is the
‘metacestode stage of Taenia hydatigena’ rather than ‘Cysticercus
tenuicollis'

PARASITESOFTHE
CIRCULATORYSYSTEM
Elaeophora schneideri
Common name: Filarial dermatosis, 'sore head'
Predilection site: Blood vessels
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: Slender worms; males are around 5 cm and females
up to 12 cm long.
Description, microscopic: Microfilariae are 270 μm, bluntly rounded
anteriorly, and tapering posteriorly.
Final hosts: Sheep, goat, deer (elk, moose, mule deer)
Intermediate hosts: Tabanid flies
Life cycle: The life cycle of E. schneideri is typically filarioid. The
microfilariae are ingested by the intermediate host, when feeding and the
L3, when developed, are released into the wound made when the insect
next feeds. Early development appears to be in the meningeal arteries, and
the worms migrate to the carotid arteries and are mature and producing
microfilariae about 4.5 months after infection. The adult worms are
embedded in the arterial intima of the arotid, mesenteric and iliac arteries;
     n     o  
around 4-5 months.
Geographical distribution: Western and southern USA
Pathogenesis: In E. schneideri infection in sheep, the circulating
microfilariae are associated with a facial dermatitis, 'sorehead', in which a
granulomatous inflammation of the skin occurs accompanied by intense
546
pruritis. Occasionally the feet are also affected. This appears in the
summer months. In severe cases there may be self-injury from rubbing,
with abrasion, bleeding and scab formation. Lesions may alternate
between periods of activity and inactivity. Lesions ultimately resolve with

Trypanosomes
Members of  the genus  Trypanosoma are haemoflagellates  of
overwhelming importance in cattle in sub-Saharan Africa but also occur in
sheep and goats. See Chapter 1 (Zoomastigophorasida) for general
description and Chapter 2 for detailed descriptions of individual species of
trypanosomes, and their control.
Trypanosoma brucei brucei
Subgenus: Trypanozoon
Common name: Nagana
Predilection site: Blood. T. brucei bucei is also found extravascularly in,
for example, the myocardium, CNS and reproductive tract.
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Hosts: Cattle, horse, donkey, zebu, sheep, goat, camel, pig, dog, cat, wild
game species
Distribution: Sub-Saharan Africa
Treatment: The two drugs in common use in cattle are isometamidium
and diaminazine aceturate and both should be suitable for use in sheep and
goats. These are usually successful except where trypanosomes have
developed resistance to the drug or in some very chronic cases. Treatment
should be followed by surveillance, since reinfection followed by clinical
animal may relapse after chemotherapy, due to a persisting focus of
infection in its tissues or because the trypanosomes are drug-resistant.
Trypanosoma congolense
Subgenus: nannomonas
Common name: Nagana, paranagana, Gambia fever, ghindi, gobial
Predilection site: Blood
550
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, horse, camel, dog, pig. Reservoir hosts include
antelope, giraffe, zebra, elephant and warthog.
Distribution: Sub-Saharan Africa
Treatment: In infected cattle, the two drugs in common use are
diminazene aceturate (Berenil) and homidium salts (Ethidium and
Novidium) and are appropriate for use in sheep and goats infected with T.
congolense. As with T. brucei, these drugs are usually successful except
where trypanosomes have developed resistance to the drug or in some
very chronic cases.
Trypanosoma vivax
Subspecies: vivax
Subgenus: Duttonella
Common name: Nagana, souma
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, camel, horse; antelope and giraffe are
reservoirs
Geographical distribution: Africa (central), West Indies, Central and
South America (Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Columbia, Guyana, French
Guyana), Mauritius
Treatment: As for T. congofense

Family: Trypanosomatidae
Hosts: Pig, camel, sheep, goat
Distribution: Central Africa

Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
end long and pointed. There is a prominent undulating membrane and a
free flagellum. Tryptomastigote forms are rare in the blood
Hosts: Sheep, goat
Life cycle: Tryptomastigotes are transmitted by the sheep ked,
Melophagus ovinus, and epimastigote and amastigote forms in the midgut
metacyclic tryptomastigote forms in the hingut. Sheep are infected when
they bite into the keds and the tryptomastigotes are released and pass
through the intact mucosa. It has been suggested that replication does not
occur in the sheep.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Non-pathogenic
Diagnosis: Infections in the blood are so sparse they can only be detected
by culture in selective medium.
552
Epidemiology: T. melophagum is transmitted by the sheep ked
Melophagus ovinus and infection is linked to the presence and abundance
of ked infections.
Treatment and control: Not required although general ectoparasite
control strategies effective against keds will also control infection levels
of the trypanosome.
Babesiosis
For details on the general life cycle and epidemiology of babesiosis see
Chapter 2: Cattle. Control measures are essentially similar and require
some level of protection but may be difficult in sheep, expensive, and may
have a negative cost benefit. Under certain conditions, it may be more
beneficial to attain endemic stability, allowing early infection and
development of immunity.
Babesia motasi
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae

parasites are usually piriform. The merozoites occur singly or in pairs and
the angle between members of a pair is usually acute.
Hosts: Sheep, goat
Geographical distribution: Southern Europe, the Middle East, the former
Soviet Union, southeast Asia and Africa
Pathogenesis: Strains of B. motasi from Europe produce a mild clinical

basin may be more pathogenic and some strains are transmissible to goats,
but this is not a consistent observation.

splenomegaly with soft, dark red splenic pulp and prominent splenic
corpuscles. The liver is enlarged and yellowish brown and the gall bladder
is distended with thick, dark bile. The mucosa of the abomasum and
intestine, subcutaneous, subserous and intramuscular connective tissues
are oedematous and icteric with patches of haemorrhage. The blood is thin
and watery, and the plasma tinged with red.
Epidemiology: Transmitted by ticks of the genus Haemaphysalis (H.
punctata, H. otophila), Dermacentor (D. silvarum) and Rhipicephalus (R.
bursa).
Treatment: Diminazene aceturate is effective against B. motasi.
Babesia ovis
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
Description: Babesia ovis is small species, 1-2.5 μm long, mostly
rounded and in the margin of the host erythrocytes, with paired, piriform
trophozoites usually lying at an obtuse angle.
Hosts: Sheep, goat
Geographical distribution: Southern Europe, former Soviet States,
Middle East, Asia
Pathogenesis: Infections occur as a pathogenic entity in southern Europe
and the Middle East but are generally mild in indigenous sheep with
area. Death, if it occurs, is due to organ failure which, in turn, is due not
only to destruction of the erythrocytes with resultant anaemia, oedema and

Clinical signs: The clinical signs of infection include anaemia, jaundice,
oedema and haemoglobinuria. Infections are often mild and often are
inapparent.
Diagnosis: Examination of blood films, stained with Giemsa, will reveal
the parasites in the red cells. Usually fewer than 0.6% of the erythrocytes
are infected.
splenomegaly with soft, dark red splenic pulp and prominent splenic
corpuscles. The liver is enlarged and yellowish brown and the gall bladder
is distended with thick, dark bile. The mucosa of the abomasum and
intestine, subcutaneous, subserous and intramuscular connective tissues
are oedematous and icteric with patches of haemorrhage. The blood is thin
and watery, and the plasma tinged with red.
Epidemiology: Rhipicephaius bursa has been shown to be a vector for
this parasite, and I. ricinus, I. persuicatus and D. reticulatus are suspected
vectors.
Treatment: Diminazene aceturate is effective against B. ovis.
Quinuronium sulphate is still used in some countries.
Theileriosis
Theileria spp are widely distributed in cattle and sheep in Africa, Asia,
Europe and Australia, have a variety of tick vectors and are associated
         
because of their morphological similarity, there are two species of major
veterinary importance in sheep.
The life cycle of Theileria spp involves erythrocytic merozoites, which are
ingested by the tick intermediate host and develop into macro- and
microgamonts to produce zygotes. These develop and enter the
555
haemolymph to become kinetes and then the salivary glands to become
fission bodies. In adult ticks, the primary fission bodies divide into
fission bodies and produce sporozoites that are released into the saliva.
Animals are infected when the ticks suck blood. The sporozoites enter
lymphocytes and become meronts; both macromeronts and micromeronts
occur, producing micromerozoites that enter erythrocytes, which after a
few binary fissions produce the varied forms that are taken up by other
ticks.
Theileria hirci
Synonym:Theilerialestoquardi
Common name: Malignant theileriosis of small ruminants
Predilection site: Blood, lymph nodes, spleen
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Theileriidae
Description: Trophozoites are found in lymphocytes and erythrocytes as
round (0.6-2.0 μm in diameter), oval, rod-shaped (1.6 μm long) forms
(Fig. 3.35). Binary or quadruple fission takes place in the erythrocytes
Meronts (Koch bodies), averaging 8 μm in diameter (range 10-20 μm) and
containing 1-80 granules, are common in the lymphocytes of the spleen
and lymph nodes.
Hosts: Sheep,goat
Geographical distribution: Southern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and
North and EastAfrica
Pathogenesis: Highly pathogenic, causing an acute and highly fatal
disease in adult sheep and goats with mortalities of 46-l00%. The
infection is mild in young lambs and kids due to maternal immunity. An
acute form is more common, but sabacute and chronic forms have been
observed.
Clinical signs: [n the acute form there is fever (40-41.7°C; 104-107°F),
inappetence, cessation of rumination, rapid heartbeat, weakness, swelling
of superficial lymph nodes and eyelids, diarrhoea (containing blood and
556
mucus) and jaundice and haemorrhage in submucous, subserous and
subcutaneous tissues may occur. Affected animals become emaciated and
death occurs. In chronic infections there is intermittent fever, inappetence,
emaciation, anaemia and jaundice
Fig. 3.35 Meront of Theileria hirci.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis depends on the detection of meronts in blood
postmortem.
Pathology: The lymph nodes are always swollen, the liver usually
swollen, the spleen markedly enlarged and the lungs oedematous. Infarcts
are often present in the kidneys, and there are petechiae on the mucosa of
the abomasum and irregularly disseminated red patches on the intestinal
mucosa.
Epidemiology: The tick vectors are thought to be Rhipicephaius bursa
and Hyalomma anatolicum.

A single dose of halofuginone at 1.2 mg/kg per os is also reported to be
effective.
Control: Tick control measures can be considered for controlling disease
Topical application of acaricides may provide some level of protection but

may be difficult in sheep, expensive, and may have a negative cost
benefit.
Notes: Causes significant losses in small ruminant populations in the
Mediterranean and NorthAfricanregions.

Common name: Tick-borne fever, pasture fever, canine granulocytic
ehrlichiosis,
human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, equine granulocyitc
erlichiosis
559
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Anaplasmataceae
Description: Blood smears stained with Giemsa or Wright's stains reveal
one or more loose aggregates (morulae or inclusion bodies, 1.5-5 μm in
diameter) of blue-grey to dark blue coccoid, coccobacillary
or
pleomorphic organisms within the cytoplasm of neutrophils (Fig. 3.36).
Hosts: Sheep, cattle, dog, horse, deer, rodents
Life cycle: Obligate intracellular organisms infecting ganulocytes,
predominantly neutrophils, appearing within the cytoplasm as
membrane-bound vacuoles. Multiplication is by binary fission forming
large inclusion bodies (morulae). In untreated animals, the cytoplasmic
inclusions can be detected in circulating neutrophils for 1-2 weeks. The
organisms spend part of their normal life cycle within the tick and are
transmitted trans-stadially. As the tick vector feeds on a wide range of
vertebrate animals, transmission of the infectious agent may take place to
multiple host species.

Pathogenesis: Organisms enter the dermis via a tick bite and are then
spread via the blood and/or the lymph and localise in mature granulocytes.
mainly in neutrophils but also in eosinophils, of the peripheral blood
However it is not clear whether they invade mature cells or precursor cells
within the myelopoietic system. After endocytosis, multiplication occurs
within cytoplasmic phagosomes and the organisms can be found in many
organs, e.g- spleen, lungs and liver. The veterinary significance of
tick-borne fever in sheep is three-fold. First, although the disease in itself
is transient, its occurrence in very young lambs on rough upland pastures
Secondly, the disease, possibly because of the associated leucopenia,
predisposes lambs to louping-ill, tick pyaemia (enzootic staphylococcosis)
and pasteurellosis. Finally, the occurrence of the disease in adult sheep or
cattle newly introduced into an endemic area may cause abortion or

infection to death. The risk of acquiring one or more tick-bome infections
may be dependent on the prevalence of multi-infected vectors. A.

reservoir hosts and vectors, and in geographical areas where tick-borne
fever is endemic, borreliosis is also prevalent.
fever, dullness and inappetence, which persist for around 10 days. During
this time, although leucopenia is marked, the characteristic 'morula'
inclusions may be seen in a variable proportion of the polymorphonuclear
leucocytes present. Recovery is usually uneventful, although such animals
remain carriers for many months.
Diagnosis: Tick-borne fever should be considered when an animal
presents with an acute febrile illness in an endemic geographic area.
Stained blood smears should be examined and, withWright's stain,
morulae typically appear as dark blue, irregularly stained densities in the
cytoplasm of neutrophils. The colour of the morulae is usually darker than
that of the cell nucleus. Morulae are often sparse and difficult to detect
and a negative blood smear cannot rule out A. phagocytophilum infection.
561
Specific diagnostic tests include immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT)
immunoblot analyses, ELISA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analyses. The most widely accepted diagnostic criterion is a four-fold
change in titre by IFAT. However, cross-reactivity may occur with other
members of the genera Anaplasma and Ehrlichia.

Of
Thrombocytopenia is one of the most consistent haematological
abnormalities in infected dogs. It may be moderate to severe and persists
for a few days before returning to normal. Biochemical abnormalities may
include mildly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and alanine
aminotransferase activities.
Epidemiology: Rodents as well as domestic and wild ruminants (sheep
and deer), have been reported as reservoir hosts of A. phagocytophilum in
Europe. The predominant reservoir host varies depending on the local
natural and agricultural landscape. The vector of A. phagocytophilum in
Europe is the common sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus. In endemic areas the
 prevalence of infection in young hill lambs is virtually 100%.
Treatment: Treatment of tick-borne fever in sheep is rarely indicated.
supplemented by one or two prophylactic injections of long-acting
oxytetracycline, which protects against infection for 2-3 weeks.
Doxycycline at 5-10 mg/kg for 3 weeks appears to be most effective
regime for treating infections in dogs and cats. Severe disease may require
treatment for longer periods. The most common side effects of
doxycycline treatment are nausea and vomiting which are avoided by
administering the drug with food.
Control: In sheep, prophylaxis depends on tick control by dipping.
Notes: The newly reclassified Anaplasma phagocytophilum combo nov
and Anaplasma platys (formerly known as E. platys)) causes canine,
equine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.

Predilection site: Blood
Fig. 3.37 Intraerythrocytic forms of Eperythrozoon ovis.
Order: Rickettsiales

of clinical signs is insidious. Lambs infected at about 2-3 months of age
show growth retardation and are slow to reach sexual maturity.
Clinical signs: Disease in lambs is mild and limited to vague ill-thrift.
Diagnosis: Identification from staining artefacts requires good blood films
and filtered Giemsa stain. The organisms appear as cocci or short rods on
the surface of the erythrocytes, often completely surrounding the margin
of the red cell. However, the organisms of Eperythrozoon are relatively
loosely attached to the red cell surface and are often found free in the
plasma.
   le e  s o r 
there is a gradual development of an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
Platelet counts are reduced and prothrombin times are prolonged
Epidemiology: E. ovis is transmitted by stable flies (Stomoxys caicitrans)
and keds (Malophagus ovinus) and in the tropics and subtropics by
mosquitoes (Aedes camptorhynchus, Anopheies annulipes, Culex

Treatment and control: Tetracyclines should be effective but control is
not usually practical or necessary.

PARASITES OF THE NERVOUS
SYSTEM
Taenia multiceps
Synonym: Muiticeps multiceps, Coenurus cerebralis
Common name: Gid, sturdy, staggers
Predilection site: Brain and spinal cord (intermediate hosts); small
intestine (final hosts)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: When mature the Coenurus cerebralis cyst is readily
recognised as a large fluid-filled transparent bladder up to 5 cm or more in
diameter.
Description, microscopic: The coenurus bears clusters of several hundred
 protoscolices on its internal wall.
Definitive hosts: Dog, fox, coyote, jackal
Intermediate hosts: Sheep, cattle, deer, pig, horse, man
Life cycle: The intermediate host is infected through the ingestion of T.
multiceps eggs. Each egg contains an oncosphere that hatches and is
activated in the small intestine. The oncosphere then penetrates the
intestinal mucosa and is carried via the blood to the brain or spinal cord
where eachoncosphere develops into the metacestode larval stage
(Coenurus cerebralis). When mature, this is readily recognised as a large
fluid-filled cyst up to 5.0 cm or more in diameter, which bears clusters of
scolices on its internal wall. In goats the cysts can also mature in
subcutaneous and intramuscular sites. The cysts in sheep and goats often
persist throughout the life of the animal. The life cycle is completed when
the final host, dog or wild canid, eats an infected sheep brain or spinal
cord.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
567
Pathogenesis: The Coenurus takes about 8 months to mature in the
       e 
pressure atrophy, which may lead to perforation of the skull. When cysts
locate in the spinal cord the resulting pressure can lead to paresis of the
hindlimbs. Although an acute form of coenurosis can occur, chronic
disease is more frequently identified. Acute disease is likely to occur when
sheep are grazed on pasture heavily contaminated with faeces from
untreated dogs. The migration of large numbers of larval stages through
the brain can rapidly lead to neurological dysfunction and death. Chronic
disease presents as a progressive focal lesion of the brain with signs of
neurological  dysfunction  appearing  about  3-6  months  from  initial
infection and is usually seen in sheep of 6-24 months of age. Coenurosis
is much less common in cattle.
Clinical signs: Clinical signs depend on the location and size of the cyst
or cysts and include circling behaviour, visual defects, peculiarities in gait,
stumbling, uncoordinated movements, hyperaesthesia or paraplegia. As
the infection progresses animals may become anorexic and lose weight
and death may result. The clinical syndrome is often known as ^gid’ or
'staggers’ in which the animal holds its head to one side and turns in a
circle to the affected side.
Diagnosis: It is difficult to diagnose infection in sheep or goats unless
obvious neurological signs are apparent. Even then other organisms, such
as Listeria monocytogenes, Oestrus ovis and louping-ill, should be
considered in any evaluation of acute coenurosis. Most diagnoses are
made at postmortem. Where cysts are located on the surface of the brain it
is sometimes possible to palpate the local softening of the frontal bones of
the skull.
Pathology: The cyst or cysts are mainly located in one cerebral
hemisphere and occur less frequently in the cerebellum and spinal cord
(Fig. 3.38). The growth of the cysts within the brain or skull causes
pressure atrophy of adjacent cerebral tissue. The migration of large
numbers of immature stages in the brain of lambs can lead to acute
meningoencephalitis. In acute cases of coenurosis, pale yellow tracts are
frequently present on the surface of the brain. They are comprised of
necrotic tissue with marked cellular infiltration. In chronic coenurosis
there may be compression of brain tissue by the developing cyst and the
568
increased intracranial pressure can result in local softening of the bones of
the skull, either above the cyst or in other areas.
Fig. 3.38 Coenurus cerebralis cyst on the surface of the cerebellum from
an infected sheep.
Epidemiology: Where livestock, particularly sheep, have access to
grazing land that is contaminated with infective dog faeces, then there is a
risk of larval migration of the metacestode stage into the central nervous
system.
Treatment: Surgical removal is possible if the cyst is situated on the brain
surface. This may be detected by local softening of the skull, or by
detailed neurological examination. However, for many cases there is no
treatment.
Control: This can be achieved through ensuring that dogs, in particular
sheep dogs, do not have access to the heads of slaughtered or dead sheep
possible. In areas where coenurosis is endemic the regular de-worming of
dogs with an effective anthelmintic every 6-8 weeks will reduce the
contamination into the environment and, by breaking the sheep-dog cycle,
may lead to eradication of the disease. Foxes are not thought to be an
important final host for T. muiticeps.

PARASITES OF THE
REPRODUCTIVE/UROGENITAL
SYSTEM
Toxoplasma gondii
Predilection site: Muscle, lung, liver, reproductive system, central
nervous system
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystidae
Description: Tachyzoites are found developing in vacuoles in many cell
types, for example fibroblasts, hepatocytes, reticular cells and myocardial
cells. In any one cell there may be 8-16 organisms, each measuring
6.0-8.0 μm. Tissue cysts, measuring up to 100 μm in diameter, are found
s u  p 'ug p  'ai as a u u
thousand lancet-shaped bradyzoites (Fig. 3.39).
Intermediate hosts: Any mammal, including man, or birds. Note that the
final host, the cat, may also be an intermediate host and harbour
extra-intestinal stages.
Fig. 3.39 Tissue cyst of Toxoplasma gondii.
570
Final host: Cat, other felids
Life cycle: The final host is the cat, in which gametogony takes place.
Sheep and goats act as an intermediate host, in which the cycle is
extra-intestinal and results in the formation of tachyzoites and bradyzoites,
which are the only forms found in non-feline hosts. Infection usually
occurs through the ingestion of sporulated oocysts. The liberated
sporozoites rapidly penetrate the intestinal wall and spread by the
haematogenous route. This invasive and proliferative stage is called the
tachyzoite and, on entering a cell, it multiplies asexually in a vacuole by a
process of budding or endodyogeny, in which two individuals are formed
within the mother cell, the pellicle of the latter being used by the daughter
cells are infected. This is the acute phase of toxoplasmosis. In most
instances, the host survives and antibody is produced which limits the
invasiveness of the tachyzoites and results in the formation of cysts
containing thousands of organisms which, because endodyogeny and
growth are slow, are termed bradyzoites. The cyst containing the
bradyzoites is the latent form, multiplication being held in check by the
acquired immunity of the host. If this immunity wanes, the cyst may
571
rupture, releasing the bradyzoites, which become active and resume the
invasive characteristics of the tachyzoites.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infections are usually acquired via the digestive tract, and
so organisms are disseminated by the lymphatics and portal system with
subsequent invasion of various organs and tissues. Pathogenic effects are
always related to the extra-intestinal phase of development. In heavy
infections, the multiplying tachyzoites may produce areas of necrosis in
vital organs, such as the myocardium, lungs, liver, and brain; during this
phase the host can become pyrexic and lymphadenopathy occurs. As the
disease progresses bradyzoites are formed, this chronic phase being
usually asymptomatic. In pregnant animals, exposed for the first time to 7.

toxoplasmosis.
Clinical signs: Undoubtedly the most important role of toxoplasmosis,
particularly in sheep, is its association with abortion in ewes and perinatal
mortality in lambs (Fig. 3.40). If infection of the ewes occurs early in
gestation (<55 days), there is death and expulsion of the small fetus, which
is seldom observed. If infection occurs in mid-gestation, abortion is more
readily detected, the organisms being found in the typical white lesions,
2.0 mm in diameter, in the cotyledons of the placenta and in fetal tissues;
alternatively the dead fetus may be retained, mummified and expelled
later. If the fetus survives in utero, the lamb may be stillborn or, if alive,
weak. Ewes that abort due to T. gondii in one year, usually lamb normally
in subsequentyears.
Diagnosis: Tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii are often difficult to find in
tissue sections, but are more likely to be present in sections of brain and
placenta. Identification can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry, while
          o

test (DT) is the longest established serological method, and in many ways
represents the gold standard, at least in humans. The dye test uses live,

tachyzoites and can be used to differentiate IgM and lgG antibodies. Other
tests for the detection of Toxoplasma antibodies include an direct
agglutination test (DAT), a latex agglutination test (LAT) and an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Fig. 3.40 Toxoplasma gondii: aborted fetus and necrotic placenta.
Abortion in sheep and goats due to T. gondii must be differentiated from
other infectious causes of abortion,
including infections with
Chiamydophila abortus (enzootic abortion), Coxiella bumetii (Q fever),
Brucella melitensis,Campylobacter fetus fetus,Salmonella spp,border
disease, and the viruses that cause bluetongue, Wesselsbron's disease and
Akabane disease.
Pathology: In heavy infections, the multiplying tachyzoites may produce
areas of necrosis in vital organs such as the myocardium, lungs, liver and
brain. In sheep abortions, characteristically the placental intercotyledonary
membranes are normal, but white foci of necrosis, approximately 2-3 mm
in diameter, may be visible in the cotyledons (Fig. 3.41). Microscopically,
these foci appear as areas of coagulative necrosis that are relatively free of
inflammation.
Inflammation,  when
 present,
，is
 non-suppurative.
Toxoplasma tachyzoites are seen only rarely in association with these foci
usually at the periphery of the lesion. Examination of the brain may reveal
focal microgliosis. The lesions often have a small central focus of necrosis
573
that might be mineralised. Focal leucomalacia in cerebral white matter,
due to anoxia arising from placental pathology, is often present. Focal
microgliosis is more specific, as leucomalacia reflects placental damage,
but may occur in other conditions such as border disease or rarely ovine
chlamydiosis.
Fig. 3.41 Cotyledons of aborted placenta showing white focal lesions
Epidemiology: The cat plays a central role in the epidemiology of
toxoplasmosis and the disease is virtually absent from areas where cats do
not occur. It is difficult to explain the widespread prevalence of
toxoplasmosis in ruminants, particularly sheep, in view of the relatively
low number of oocysts shed into the environment. It has been suggested
that pregnant ewes are most commonly infected during periods of

been contaminated with cat faeces in which millions of oocysts may be
present. Further spread of oocysts may occur via coprophagous insects,
which can contaminate vegetables, meat and animal fodder. It has been
suggested that venereal transmission can occur in sheep.
Treatment: Not indicated
Control: On farms, control is difficult, but where possible animal
feedstuffs should be covered to exclude access by cats and insects.
Monensin and decoquinate have also been administered to ewes in

becoming pregnant. Presumably, the value of this technique depends on
the replacements being exposed to circumstances similar to those of the
initial outbreak. It is sometimes also advised to mix replacement stock
with ewes at the time of the outbreak of abortion in order to facilitate
transmission of infection. This is extremely unwise, since other causes of
abortion, notably the agent of enzootic abortion of ewes, if also present,
may affect the replacement stock and be responsible for abortion in
subsequent years. Fortunately, a vaccine is now available for sheep, which
is less of a hit or miss' than the above techniques. This is a live vaccine

potential to form oocysts in cats. It is usually recommended to vaccinate
the whole flock initially and thereafter only annual vaccination of

as a single dose intramuscularly at least 3 weeks prior to tupping.
PARASITES OF THE
LOCOMOTORY SYSTEM
Taenia ovis
Synonym: Cysticercus ovis
Common name: Ovine cysticercosis, 'sheep measles
Predilection site: Small intestine (final host); muscle (intermediate host)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description: Mature cysticerci are ovoid, white and around 3.5-10 mm
and contain a single protoscolex, which is invaginated and is armed with
hooks and a rostellum.
Definitive hosts: Dog, fox, wild carnivores.
575
Intermediate hosts: Sheep, goat
Life cycle: Dogs and wild canids are infested by consuming the
cysticercus in the intermediate host. The intermediate host is infected
usually located in the skeletal muscle, heart, diaphragm and intermuscular
connective tissue. The cyst becomes infective around 2-3 months after
infection of the host. The prepatent period in dogs is around 6-9 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide.
Pathogenesis: Ovine cysticercosis is primarily important because of
aesthetic objections to the appearance of the cysts in sheep meat and, in
consequence, it can be a significant cause of economic loss through
condemnation at meat inspection.
Clinical signs: Adult tapeworms normally induce only mild symptoms in
the host and are considered to be of little pathogenic importance. Infected
intermediate hosts do not usually show clinical signs of disease. Sheep can
develop a strong acquired immunity to reinfection.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis in sheep and goats is through the identification of
cysts at meat inspection.
Pathology: The mature, ovoid white cysticerci are grossly visible in the
cardiac and skeletal musculature of sheep and goats. Commonly the
cysticerci are degenerate with a green or cream, caseous or calcified

Intermediate hosts: Sheep
Final host: Dog
Life cycle: Sheep become infected by ingesting sporocysts, passed in the
faeces of the dog. Once ingested there are three asexual generations. In the
first, sporozoites, released from the sporocysts, invade the intestinal wall
and enter the capillaries where they locate in endothelial cells in many
organs and undergo two merogony cycles. A third asexual cycle occurs in
the circulating lymphocytes, the resulting merozoites penetrating muscle
endodyogeny giving rise to broad banana-shaped bradyzoites contained
within a cyst; this is the mature sarcocyst and is the infective stage for the

Clinical signs: In heavy infections in sheep, there is anorexia, fever,
anaemia, loss of weight, a disinclination to move and sometimes
recumbency; in lambs a dog-sitting posture has been recorded. Abortions
may occur in breeding stock.
Pathology: In sheep, meronts present in endothelial cells of capillaries in
various organs lead to endothelial cell destruction. As the organisms enter
muscle, a wide range of change may be encountered. Microscopic
inspection   of Sarcocystis-infected  muscle  often reveals occasional
degenerate   parasitic  cysts   surrounded  by  variable   numbers  of
inflammatory cells (very few of which are eosinophils) or, at a later stage,
macrophages and granulation tissue. Usually there is no muscle fibre
degeneration, but there may be thin, linear collections of lymphocytes
between fibres in the region. The extent of muscle change bears little
relationship to the numbers of developing cysts, but generally very low
numbers of Sarcocystis produce no reaction. As cysts mature, the cyst
capsule within the enlarged muscle fibre becomes thicker and more clearly
differentiated from the muscle sarcoplasm.

small, measuring 28 μm in diameter. In contrast, the bradyzoite cysts can
be very large and visible to the naked eye as whitish streaks running in the
 s    a  a  e

Intermediate hosts:Sheep
Final host: Cat
Life cycle: Infection is by ingestion of the sporocysts and this is followed
by a single asexual generation in capillaries and arterioles of the lung,
kidney and brain, from which the resulting merozoites penetrate muscle
cells. There they encyst and then divide by a process of budding or
endodyogeny giving rise to broad banana-shaped bradyzoites contained
within the sarcocyst. Sarcocysts are found primarily in the muscles of the

Geographical distribution: Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and

Pathogenesis: Heavy infestations can result in loss of weight, reduction in
milk production; however, the chief importance of Przhevaiskiana is in
hide damage.
Clinical signs: Symptoms depend on the intensity of infestation and on
restless, reduce feeding, and significantly infested animals lose condition.
Except for poor growth and decreased milk yield in cases of heavy

infestation, the host animals show no appreciable signs until the larvae and
Diagnosis: The presence of the larvae in swellings under the skin,
detected by palpaption, allows diagnosis. Respiratory holes at the centre of
each swelling, with associated reddish dried exudate may be observed.
The eggs may also be found on the hairs of the animals in the summer.
Serological diagnosis has been demonstrated to be effective.
Pathology: The pathology is variable and depends on the intensity of
infestation. Histologically, a fibrous, thick-walled carivity is formed
around the third-stage larva by granulation tissue, surrounded by a
hyalinised and eosinophilic cuff. After granulocyte infiltration there may
be a second infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and
giant cells.
Epidemiology: Younger animals appear to be more prone to infestation
than older animals. Flock prevalences of between 30 and 90% have been
reported in goat herds in southern Italy and Greece, with mean intensities
of about five larvae per animal.
Treatment: Organophosphate insecticides, such as trichlorophon, appear
to be less effective when used to treat goat warble fly infestation than for
bovine hypodermosis. However, the macrocyclic lactones, abamectin,
Ivermectin, doramectin, eprinomectin and moxidectin, have been shown to
be highly effective against P. silenus infestation.

ECTOPARASITES
LICE
Heavy louse infestation is known as pediculosis. Blood-sucking lice have
been implicated in the transmission of disease; however, lice are
predominantly of importance because of the direct damage they cause.
This effect is usually a function of their density. A small number of lice is
very common and presents no problem. However, louse populations can
increase dramatically reaching high densities. Transfer of lice from animal
to animal or from herd to herd is usually by direct physical contact.
Because lice do not survive for long off their host, the potential for
animals to pick up infestations from dirty housing is limited, although it
cannot be ignored. Occasionally, lice also may be transferred between
animals by attachment to flies (phoresy).
Description: Lice have a segmented body divided into a head, thorax and
abdomen. They have three pairs of jointed legs and a pair of short
antennae. All lice are dorsoventrally flattened and wingless. The sensory
organs are poorly developed; the eyes are vestigial or absent.
u uo pue sy au usum uaas aq reu s sun pue aoil au ssisouii
skin when the coat is parted. The lice may be removed and identified
under a light microscope.
Pathology: The pathology of louse infestation is extremely variable.
Infestations may induce alopecia, irritation, papulocrustous dermatitis and
selfexcoriation.Sucking lice may cause anaemia.
Epidemiology: Generally, for the transfer of louse infestation, close
bodily contact is necessary. Transmission occurs when sheep are brought
together as in sale yards, and especially when sheep are housed for the
winter since the heavy fleece provides a habitat that is readily colonised
by lice. Adult lice positioned near to the tip of the wool fibre are passed on
infested sheep just four months to infest the entire flock. Lice populations
 peak in spring and lambs may be particularly susceptible to infestation.
586
Treatment: Several topical insecticides, such as amidine, amitraz or
organophosphates
(for
example,  chlorfenvinphos,  coumaphos,
chlorpyrifos, crotoxyphos, trichlorfon, phosmet and propetamphos),
applied in dips or spray are effective but are becoming more limited in
their availability in some countries due to safety and environmental
concerns. Two treatments, 14 days apart, may be required. Topical
application of the pour-on pyrethroid, cypermethrin, the spot-on
deltamethrin and the insect growth regulator (IGR), triflumuron, have also
been shown to be effective. The pyrethroids, which act by diffusion over
the body surface in the sebum and give protection for 8-14 weeks, are
probably the treatment of choice. Macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin,
doramectin and moxidectin) may also be used, although they have only
limited activity against chewing lice. The situation for goats is different in
that few treatments have been specifically evaluated for use in goats and
pour-on treatments may be less effective because of the variability in hair
fibres found on different goat breeds
Control: Louse control in sheep is generally not difficult to achieve due to
the wide variety of chemical classes that are effective, although resistance
has occurred in some countries. Nevertheless, in an attempt to reduce the
risk of selection for resistance, rotation of chemical classes may be
advantageous. A good degree of louse control can be achieved by shearing
because solar radiation and dehydration reduce the hatch rate of louse
eggs. Subsequently, another good management procedure is to treat sheep
immediately after shearing, which ensures a greater proportion of lice
come into contact with insecticide and reduces the volume of chemical
necessary to achieve this. If ewes are dipped during early pregnancy, the
risk that they still will be louse infested at lambing is reduced, as is the
chance of lambs becoming infested. Then dipping the lambs results in the
flock getting as close to louse-free as possible. The ewe lambs, when old
enough to be mated, should not then be in a position to so readily infest
their progeny. This could lead to a situation where treatment is necessary
less frequently, assuming that there is a residual louse population as is
commonly the case.
Bovicola ovis
Synonym: Damalinia ovis
587
Predilection site: The upper epidermal layers mainly on the back and
upper parts of the body
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Ischnocera
Family: Trichodectidae
Description: These chewing lice are up to 3 mm long, reddish brown in
colour, with a relatively large head that is as wide as the body and rounded
anteriorly. The mouthparts are ventral. Bovicola has a three-segmented
antenna and a single claw on each tarsus.
Hosts: Sheep
Life cycle: During a lifespan of about 1 month the female lays two to
to the hair where they may be seen with the naked eye. Bovicola ovis
prefers areas close to the skin such as the back, neck and shoulder, but is
highly mobile and severe infestations will spread over the whole body. It
is estimated to take about 20 weeks for a population of B. ovis on a sheep
to increase from 5oo0 to half a million, under favourable conditions. A
nymph hatches from the egg; nymphs are similar to, although much
smaller than, the adult. The nymph moults twice, at 5-9-day intervals,
until eventually moulting to become an adult. The whole cycle from egg
to adult takes 2-3 weeks.
The mouthparts of these lice are adapted for biting and chewing the outer
layers of the hair shafts, dermal scales and blood scabs. Bovicola ovis is
capable of rapid population expansion and this is thought to be aided by
parthenogenesis. Hence, highly female-biased sex ratios may be common
in a growing population.
Bovicola ovis is very active, roaming in the wool over the entire body. It is
susceptible to high temperatures, but it is also intolerant of moisture. In a
damp fleece, with a relative humidity of more than 90%, it will die in 6
hours, and when covered by water it will drown in an hour.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
588
Pathogenesis: Bovicola may cause intense irritation, resulting in rubbing
and scratching, with matting and loss of hair, involving almost the whole
body in extreme cases. The scratching animal may tear or pull out the
fleece and exuded serum from bite wounds may cause wool matting and
discoloration. Wounds may attract blowflies. Lice reduce the quality of
wool and can reduce wool production if left uncontrolled.
Clinical signs: Restlessness, rubbing and damage to the coat would
suggest that lice are present, and when the hair is parted the parasites will
be found. Lice appear as small yellowish specks in the hair and the small
 pale eggs are readily found, scattered throughout the coat.
Bovicola caprae
Synonym: Damalinia caprae
Common name: Red louse
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta

three nymphal stages. The egg-to-adult life cycle requires about 20-40
days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, but particularly common in
Australia and New Zealand
Pathogenesis: Lice cause sheep to rub and scratch, sometimes to the point
of denuding areas of skin. Infestation by Linognathus spp results in a
chronic dermatitis characterised by constant irritation, rubbing and biting
of the fleece.Because they are blood feeders, anaemia is common where
high populations of lice exist. Anaemia may predispose animals to
respiratory or other diseases. L. ovillus is a known vector of
Eperythrozoon ovis in sheep.
Clinical signs: Linognathus ovillus is manly found on the face of sheep
but at high densities may spread over the entire body. Infested animals
have a ragged appearance, often with tags of wool hanging from the
fleece. Newly infested sheep are very sensitive to lice. Others, which have
had lice for long periods, can develop quite severe infestations but show
few signs. Often lousy wool has a yellow colour due to a heavy suint and
skin secretions.
Linognathus pedalis

Pathogenesis: On the host L. pedalis is more sedentary than L. ovillus and
tends to occur in aggregations in its preferred sites which are the more
lightly wooled areas of the body such as the legs, belly and feet. However,

MITES
The ectoparasitic mites of sheep and goats feed on blood, lymph, skin
debris or sebaceous secretions, which they ingest by puncturing the skin,
scavenge from the skin surface or imbibe from epidermal lesions. Most
ectoparasitic mites spend their entire lives associated their host, so that
transmission from host to host is primarily by physical contact. Infestation
by mites is called acariasis and can result in severe dermatitis, known as
mange, which may cause significant welfare problems and economic
losses.
Demodex ovis
Synonym: Demodex ariae
Predilection site: Hair follicles and sebaceous glands, most common on
the face
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Demodicidae
593
0.1-0.4 mm in length, with four pairs of stumpy legs ending in small blunt
claws in the adult (Fig. 6.32). Setae are absent from the legs and body.
The legs are located at the front of the body, and as such the striated
opisthosoma forms at least half the body length.
Hosts:Sheep
Life cycle: Demodex spp usually live as commensals in the skin, and are
highly site-specific, occupying the hair follicles and sebaceous glands.
Females lay 20-24 spindle-shaped eggs in the hair follicle, and these give
rise to hexapod larvae, in which each short leg ends in a single,
three-pronged claw. Unusually, a second hexapod larval stage follows, in
protonymph, tritonymph and adult stages then follow. Immature stages
and these migrate more deeply into the dermis. One follicle may harbour
all life cycle stages concurrently. The life cycle is completed in 18-24

outgrowths. The presence of Demodex mites much deeper in the dermis
than sarcoptids means that they are much less accessible to surface-acting
acaricides. Species of Demodex are unable to survive off their host.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: This form of mange is rare in sheep and is of little
  n      si  s  
character. Large numbers of mites may cause hide damage.
Clinical signs: Ovine demodectic mange is uncommon. Clinical signs
include alopecia and scaling, especially on the face, neck and shoulders.
Diagnosis: For confirmatory diagnosis, deep scrapings are necessary to
reach the mites deep in the follicles and glands. This is best achieved by

Pathology: Lesions may be papular, nodular and, rarely, pustular. The
mites in sebaceous glands occasionally induce folliculitis or furunculosis.

domestic animals, including humans. They are believed to form a group of
hosts: Demodex phylloides (pig), Demodex canis (dog), Demodex bovis
(cattle), Demodex equi (horse), Demodex musculi (mouse), Demodex ratti
(rat), Demodex caviae (guineapig), Demodex cati (cat) and Demodex
folliculorum and Demodex brevis on humans. Various morphological
variations may be seen on a host, these are sometimes, probably
incorrectly, ascribed separate species status.
Demodex caprae

Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Demodicidae
Description: See D. ovis
Hosts: Goat
Life cycle: See D. ovis
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
595
Pathogenesis: The disease is similar to that in cattle. The initial lesions on
the face and neck extend to the chest and flanks and may eventually
involve the whole body, with the formation of cutaneous nodules of up to
20 mm in diameter containing yellowish, caseous material with large
numbers of mites. This form of mange is rarely debilitating, and is of
greatest importance as a cause of down-grading or condemnation of goat
skins.
Clinical signs: Pea-sized nodules containing caseous material and mites,
particularly on the withers, lateral neck, back and flanks. Concurrent
pyoderma may occur, leading to furunculosis with ulceration and crust
formation.
Diagnosis: For confirmatory diagnosis, deep scrapings are necessary to
reach the mites deep in the follicles and glands. This is best achieved by
taking a fold of skin, applying a drop of liquid paraffin, and scraping until
capillary blood appears.
Pathology: Cutaneous nodules consist of follicular cysts lined with
squamous epithelium and filled with waxy keratin squames and mites.
Eruption of the cysts on to the skin may form a thick cust; rupture within
the dermis may form an abcess or granulomatous reaction.
Epidemiology: Probably because of its location deep in the dermis, it is
very difficult to transmit Demodex between animals unless there is
prolonged contact. Such contact usually only occurs during suckling, and
as such it is thought that most infections are acquired in the early weeks of
life. The muzzle, neck, withers and back are common sites of infestation.
Treatment: In many cases, demodecosis spontaneously resolves and
treatment is unnecessary. The organophosphate trichlofon, used on three
occasions 2 days apart, and systemic macrocyclic lactones may be
effective.
Control: Control is rarely applied.
Psoroptes ovis

Common name: Scab mite
596
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Psoroptidae
Description: Mites of the genus Psoroptes are nonburrowing mites, up to
0.75 mm in length and oval in shape (Fig. 3.43). All the legs project

whip-like setae on the third pair. In contrast, the smaller adult males,
which are recognisable by their copulatory suckers and paired posterior
lobes, have pulvilli on the first three pairs of legs and setae on the fourth
whereas in males, the fourth pair is extremely short.
Hosts: Sheep, cattle, goat, horse, rabbit, camelids
Life cycle: The eggs of P. ovis are relatively large, about 250 μm in
length, and oval. The hexapod larva which hatches from the egg is about
330 μm long. The larva moults into a protonymph, the protonymph moults
into a tritonymph and the tritonymph moults to become an adult. Egg,

(b)
Adult females produce eggs at a rate of about 2-3 per day on average. The
median life expectancy for an adult female P. ovis is about 16 days, during
which it will have laid about 40-50 eggs. Populations of P. ovis on a host
may therefore grow quickly doubling every 6 days or so.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide; particularly Europe and South
America, but not Australia or New Zealand
Pathogenesis: The mites are non-burrowing and feed superficially on a
lipid emulsion of skin cells, bacteria and lymph on the host skin, produced
as a result of a hypersensitivity reaction to the presence of antigenic mite
faecal material.
 This hypersensitivity causes inflammation, surface
exudation, scale and crust formation, with excoriation (scratching) due to
selftrauma. Infestation is described as psoroptic mange or sheep scab (Fig.
3.45). The serous exudate produced in response to the mites dries on the
skin to form a dry, yellow crust, surrounded by a border of inflamed skin
covered in moist crust. Mites are found on the moist skin at the edge of the
lesion, which extends rapidly and may take as little as 6-8 weeks to cover
three quarters of the host's skin. Eventually the crust lifts off as the new
fleece grows.
Infestation in sheep leads to severe pruritus, wool loss, restlessness, biting
and scratching of infested areas, weight loss, reduced weight gain and in
598
some cases, death. When handled, infested sheep may demonstrate a
'nibble reflex', characterised by lip smacking and protrusion of the
the neck, shoulders, back and flanks. [n severe cases the skin may be
excoriated, lichenified and  secondarily infected,  with  numerous
thick-walled abscesses of between 5 and 20 mm in diameter. Sheep scab
can affect sheep of all ages but may be particularly severe in young lambs
and sheep in poor condition.
The incidence of the disease varies according to season. In warm weather,
mite populations may decline, leaving residual populations in sites such as
the axilla, groin, infra-orbital fossa and inner surface of the pinna and
auditory canal during spring, summer and early autumn. Populations of
Psoroptes may also be found localised in the ears of sheep,causing
chronic irritation, often associated with haematomas, head shaking and
scratching-
Clinical signs: The earliest phase following infection is seen as a zone of
inflammation with small vesicles and serous exudate. As the lesion
spreads, the centre becomes dry and covered by a yellow crust while the
borders, in which the mites are multiplying, are moist. Scab lesions occur
most frequently around the shoulders and the back. The first visible sign is
usually a patch of lighter wool, but as the area of damage enlarges, the

wool becomes ragged and stained, and is shed from large areas. In
addition to wool loss, the sheep may become restless and preoccupied in
scratching. As a result, weight gains may be impaired in growing animals.
while in adults there may be weight loss.

Diagnosis: Another non-burrowing mite, Chorioptes, can be common in
sheep, and it is essential that this less pathogenic mite should be
differentiated from the pathogenic Psoroptes. The important differential
features are shown in Fig. 3.44. Although relatively easy to identify the
active disease within a flock, the latent lesions make it more difficult to
declare a flock free of infection. Particular attention should be paid to the
    a    sl   n s
600
skin scrapings taken around the lesion; this can then be examined
microscopically.
Pathology: The mite faeces and its flora, shed cuticle and enzymes in the
peritrophic membrane which surrounds the faecal pellets, induce a
subcorneal oesinophilic pustules, and a dermal infiltrate composed of
eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, accompanied by
mast cell hyperplasia. There is pronounced dermal oedema.
Fig. 3.45 Sheep with psoroptic mange (photograph courtesy of Dr
Eduardo Berriatua).
Epidemiology: Transmission is primarily through physical contact and
the majority of sheep become infected while the mites are active and
multiplying. However, transmission may also occur via the environment.
The length of time a mite can survive off its host is strongly affected by
ambient temperature and humidity, but at low temperatures (<15°C) and
high humidity (>75% relative humidity), survival may be in excess of 18
days, allowing transmission from housing, bedding or contaminated
machinery, such as shearing equipment. Time of year may have an
important impact on off-host survival. This has important implications for
the potential for transmission from the environment to new hosts,
transmission being considerably greater in the winter.
601
The period when the mite infestation has declined, either as a response to
environmental conditions or the host's immune response, is also very
significant in the epidemiology of the disease. Sheep that appear to be

Outbreaks.
Treatment: Although several methods of applying acaricide, such as
showering, have been tested, plunge dipping is generally recommended
minute, and the head should be immersed at least twice. They should be
held in clean pens before dipping and it is customary to hold them in
 draining pens for a time afterwards to conserve dip and assist in its proper
disposal. Modern acaricides have been developed which have an affinity
acaricide is gradually 'stripped out', and manufacturers give directions for
replenishment after a speciffied number of sheep have been dipped.
[In most countries in which control is practised, only specified acaricides
are permitted for use in dips. For many years only gamma BHC (gamma
replaced by the organophosphates, diazinon and propetamphos, which in
detoxified and excreted from tissues. The synthetic pyrethroids, flumethrin
and c-cypermethrin, have also been licensed for the control of sheep scab
in some countries.
Two treatments with injectable ivermectin at 200 μg/kg and an interval of 
7 days have given complete clearance of Psoroptes ovis. Additionally,
doramectin given at 300 μg/kg or moxidectin at 200 μg/kg give control
following a single injection; all are now licensed in several countries for
thispurpose.
Control: Because of its short population turnover period of 10 days there
is very rapid spread, and it is this character which has led to legislative
control in many countries since the economic consequences of
uncontrolled sheep scab are serious. For example, the disease was
  o   g so o s    
reappeared in 1973, most probably having been introduced as the
quiescent phase in imported sheep and very rapidly spread to flocks
602
throughout the UK. It was eradicated from Australia and New Zealand
many years ago, but remains notifiable in these countries. Legislation in
support of control is based on inspection of flocks, limitation of movement
and compulsory treatment of all sheep at prescribed times.
The main source of infection of a flock is through the introduction of new
     o

Notes: The taxonomy of the mites in this genus is confused, with mites
located in different parts of the body or on different hosts traditionally
given different species names; however, little good evidence exists to
support this nomenclature.
Psorergates ovis
Synonym: Psorobia ovis
Common name: Sheep itch mite
Predilection site: Skin, all over the body
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Psorergatidae
Description: Psorergates ovis is a small mite, roughly circular in form
and less than 0.2 mm in diameter (Fig. 3.46). The legs are arranged more
or less equidistantly around the body circumference, giving the mite a
crude star shape. Larvae of P. ovis have short, stubby legs. The legs
the legs are well developed and the mites become mobile. Adults are
about 190 μm long and 160 μm wide. The tarsal claws are simple and the
empodium is padlike. The femur of each leg bears a large, inwardly
directed curved spine. In the adult female, two pairs of long, whip-like
setae are present posteriorly; in the male there is only a single pair.
603
Hosts: Sheep, particularly fine-wooled breeds such as Merino sheep
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, hexapod larva, followed by
octopod protonymph, tritonymph and adult. All developmental stages

days.
Fig. 3.46 Adult female Psorergates (reproduced from Baker et al., 1956).
Geographical distribution: Australia, New Zealand, southern Africa,
North and South America. It has not been reported in Europe.
Pathogenesis: Infection is most common in fine-wool breeds such as the
Merino and Corriedale and is acquired by contact when the wool is short;
as the fleece lengthens, it presents a barrier to the transfer of mites. The
spread of the mite population is very slow, and infestation is rarely found
in animals less than 6 months old. The animal may be 3 years or more
before the whole fleece area is affected.
604
Though a‘non-burrowing’ mite,Psorergates attacks the skin itself, living
in the superficial layers and causing chronic irritation and skin thickening
The earliest signs are small, pale areas of wool on the shoulders, body and
flanks, which gradually extend over the rest of the fleece, with irritation
increasing as the mite population grows. Sheep rub, bite and chew their
wool, which becomes ragged, with loose strands trailing from the sides of
the body. In long-standing cases, large patches of wool may be lost. The
fleece itself contains much scurf and has a slightly yellowish hue, while
the staple is very dry and easily broken. Microscopically there is a
hyperkeratosis and marked desquamation, with the deeper superficial
layers showing round-cell infiltration and eosinophilia in the immediate
vicinity of the parasite. In severe cases the whole fleece, which is difficult
to shear because of its matted consistency, must be discarded. In less
severely affected sheep and especially in older animals (which have
become tolerant of the itch because of their thickened, damaged skin)
fleeces are downgraded.
Clinical signs: These parasites are severely irritating, causing the host
animal to rub and bite at their fleece. The fleece may be weakened and the
wool may break easily
Diagnosis: To obtain mites it is necessary, having clipped away a patch of
wool, to apply a drop of mineral oil and scrape the skin down to the blood
capillary level. The mites themselves are easily identified using a
microscope. The absence of mites in a single scraping is not sufficient
evidence for a negative diagnosis.
Epidemiology: The adult mites are spread by direct contact between hosts
  s        
found at higher densities in winter and spring. Psorergates ovis is very
sensitive to desiccation, can only survive for 24-48 hours off the host and
only the adults are mobile. As a consequence of these factors, the spread
of infestation through a flock is generally slow and is most evident during
the winter months.
Treatment: Psorergates is relatively unsusceptible to most acaricides.
although the formamidine amitraz and lime-sulphur dips have been shown
to be of considerable value. Otherwise, the older arsenic-sulphur
605
preparations may be used. Macrocyclic lactones are highly effective
against this species, with a single treatment usually killing all the mites.
Control: Sheep should be dipped soon after shearing. Annual dipping
after shearing will suppress the mite population, keeping the infestation
rate low, but rarely eradicating it completely
Sarcoptes scabiei
Common name: Scabies
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Sarcoptidae
Pathogenesis, sheep: The mite, unlike the nonburrowing mites of the
genus Psoroptes, prefers regions without wool, such as the face, ears,
axillae and groin, and has a slow spread. Affected areas are at first
erythematous and scurfy. The intense pruritus characteristic of sarcoptic
mange is present, and sheep scratch and rub the head, body and legs
against trees, posts and walls. Because of the itch, sheep are almost
continuously restless and are unable to graze, so that there is progressive
emaciation. In haired sheep the whole body may be affected. Sarcoptic
mange has a wide geographic distribution in many sheep-raising areas of
the world, such as the Middle East. In Africa it occurs in the local breeds
of haired sheep and, because of hide damage, is of considerable economic

606
As in other sarcoptic infections the main signs are irritation with
encrustations, loss of hair and excoriation from rubbing and scratching. In
long-standing cases the skin becomes thickened and nodules may develop
on the less well haired parts of the skin, including the muzzle, around the
eyes, and inside the ears.
Treatment: In sheep, treatment and control are similar to those described
for the more common psoroptic mange. In goats, repeated treatment is
often necessary, sometimes over several months in long-standing cases.
The acaricide which has been most widely used is gamma HCH, and
where this is no longer available there may be problems obtaining a
treatment of milking goats, a single injection of systemic macrocyclic
lactone may be effective. Corticosteroid therapy has been reported to aid
recovery as it suppresses the pruritus

Chorioptes bovis
Synonym: Chorioptes ovis, Chorioptes equi, Chorioptes caprae,
Chorioptes cuniculi
Predilection site: Skin, particularly the legs, feet, base of tail and upper
rear surface of the udder
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Psoroptidae
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, horse, goat, rabbit
Pathogenesis: [n sheep, the mites are found mainly on the legs and feet
and, though very common, little harm is caused (Fig. 3.44). When clinical
forefeet. The mites cluster about the accessory digits and along the
coronary border of the outer claws, causing crusting below the accessory
607
digits and in the interdigital spaces. Lambs are thought to become infected
by contact with the legs of the ewe. In some cases there may be spread
from the limbs to the face and other regions and, in occasional severe
cases, pustular dermatitis (with wrinkling and thickening of the skin) may
occur.
It has been noted in New Zealand that when the mange spreads to the
scrotum the thickened and inflamed skin allows the scrotal temperature to
remain high with, as a result, testicular atrophy and cessation of
spermatogenesis. Infected rams have impaired reproductive ability or
sterility, though their general health is not affected. The condition is not
irreversible; semen production and  fertility return to normal after
successful mange treatment. Prevalence of leg and scrotal mange is
usually highest in the autumn and winter months, and declines in spring.
In goats, the mites occur mostly on the forefeet around the accessory
digits and claws. However, they may also occur higher on the foot and on
the pastern. The lesions produced are relatively mild. Infestation rates of
C. bovis tend to be higher in goats than sheep, with up to 80-90% of goats
in individual herds being parasitised.
Treatment: Chorioptic mange in sheep is easily treated by dipping or by
local treatment with a suitable acaricide. Macrocyclic lactones are an
effective treatment against chorioptic mange. Crotoxyphos (0.25%)
applied as a spray can also be used to treat infestations.
In goats, a suitable acaricidal wash, scrubbed on to the lesions on two
occasions, 14 days apart, is effective.
Notes: The names Chorioptes ovis, Chorioptes equi, Chorioptes caprae
and Chorioptes cuniculi used to describe the chorioptic mites found on
sheep, horses, goats and rabbits respectively, are now all thought to be
synonyms of Chorioptes bovis.

FLIES
Melophagus ovinus
Common name: Sheep ked
608
Predilection site: Skin on the neck, shoulders and belly
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Hippoboscidae
Description, adult:  Hairy, brown,  wingless, ‘degenerate’ fly,
approximately 5.0-8.0 mm long with a short head and broad,
dorsoventrally flattened, brownish thorax and abdomen (Figs 3.47, 3.48).
The abdomen is indistinctly segmented and is generally soft and leathery.
Both sexes are completely wingless and even the halteres are absent. They
have piercing bloodsucking mouthparts and strong legs provided with
claws that enable them to cling onto wool and hair.
Hosts:Sheep
Life cycle: Keds are permanent ectoparasites and live for several months
feeding on the blood of sheep and sometimes goats. A single egg is
ovulated at a time. The egg hatches inside the body of the female and the
larva is retained and nourished within the female during its three larval
stages, until it is fully developed. The mature larvae produced by the
females adhere to the wool. These are immobile and pupate immediately.
The 3.04.0 mm long brown puparia are easily visible on the fleece. The
 pupae are fully formed within 12 hours of larviposition and are resistant to
this period may be extended considerably during winter. Copulation
occurs 3-4 days after emergence, and females are able to produce
offspring 14 days after emergence. Although one mating provides
sufficient sperm for a lifetime, repeated matings usually occur when
multiple males are present. A female produces between 10 and 20 larvae
in its lifetime. Ked populations build up slowly since each female
produces only one larva every 10-12 days. Adults can only live for short
periods off their hosts.

609
Fig. 3.48 The sheep ked Melophagus ovinus.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, but most common in temperate
areas
610
Pathogenesis: Since keds suck blood, heavy infections may lead to loss of
condition and anaemia. Inflammation leads to pruritus, biting, rubbing,
wool loss and a vertical ridging of the skin known as ‘cockle'.
Melophagus ovinus is also responsible for an allergic dermatitis in sheep
characterised by small nodules on the grain layer of the skin, reduced
weight gain and darkened patches at the affected site. They are spread by
contact and long-wooled breeds appear to be particularly susceptible.
Melophagusovinusis thevector of thenon-pathogenicTrypanosoma
melophagium. If the sheep eats a ked the metacyclic stages may penetrate
the buccal mucosa.
Clinical signs: Intense irritation from infestation causes sheep to rub, bite
to further bacterial and parasitic infections. The faeces of the keds produce
stains in the coat that do not wash out readily
Diagnosis: Adults and pupae may be seen on the host animal, most
frequently around the ribs.
Epidemiology: Keds are permanent ectoparasites. The spread of sheep
keds is largely through contact, and the movement of keds from ewes to
lambs is an important route of infestation. Within a flock, transfer occurs
air temperature. Air temperature must usually be 21°C or above before
many keds are observed on the surface of the fleece. Consequently,
transfer between animals is more likely, and occurs more rapidly, in
summer than in winter. Sheep with dense, long or clotted fleeces are more
likely to spread the infection because the keds come to the surface of such
fleeces. Heavy infestations of keds are most commonly seen in autumn
and winter. Poorly fed animals or those that are not sufficiently protected
against cold weather are most liable to suffer from keds, and the parasites
are particularly common towards the end of winter.
Treatment: Organophosphates and pyrethroids applied as dips, sprays or
pour-on formulations are highly effective at treating M. ovinus
infestations. Pupae are resistant to treatment but shearing removes pupae
and adults.
611
Control: Specific measures are rarely undertaken, since the routine use of
insecticides for the control of blowflies and ticks usually also results in the
efficient control of keds.
Notes: The sheep ked is of considerable economic importance and is
generally regarded as one of the most damaging ectoparasites of sheep in
North America. The overall losses in the USA due to keds have been
estimated to be about US$40 million per year.
FLY STRIKE (MYIASIS)
Myiasis is the infestation of the organs or tissues of host animals by the
larval stages of dipterous flies, usually known as maggots or grubs. The
fly larvae feed directly on the host's necrotic or living tissue. A small
number of species are obligate ectoparasites and must have a living host to
complete their development. The majority, however are facultative
parasites and these can develop in both living and dead organic matter.
The facultative species can be subdivided into primary and secondary
  o      s
habit and are capable of initiating myiasis, but may occasionally live as
saprophages in decaying organic matter and animal carcases. The
secondary  facultative ectoparasites normally  live as saprophages and
usually cannot initiate a myiasis; they may secondarily invade pre-existing
infestations. The three obligate species of myiasis fly are dealt with in
Chapter 11.
Clinical signs: Infestations resulting from small numbers of larvae may be
tolerated well by sheep; nothing can be seen until the fleece is parted,
revealing the damaged skin and the larvae. Heavily affected sheep are
anorexic, appear dull and usually stand away from the main flock. The
fleece in the affected area is darker, has a damp appearance and a foul

separated and the area surrounding the lesion clipped. Where possible

sheep with insecticides. The problems associated with this are the
infestations (which occur throughout the season) and the rapidity with
which severe damage occurs. Any insecticide used must therefore not only
kill the larvae, but also persist in the fleece. Organophosphorous and
pyrethroids insecticides may give effective protection for up to 10 weeks.
Application of these insecticides is made by hand spraying, plunge
dipping, in a spray race or by jetting. In the northern hemisphere, two
annual treatments, usually in May and August should give protection for
the whole of the fly season. The insect growth inhibitors, cyromazine and
dicyclanil, give excellent protection for 8 or 12 weeks respectively after a
single application. However, these chemicals must be applied as a pour-on
before an anticipated challenge.
Other measures that should be taken to aid control are the prevention of
diarrhoea by effective worm control and the removal of excess wool from
the groin and perineal area to prevent soiling, a technique known as
crutching. Shearing reduces strike risk in ewes and the docking of lamb
tails will also significantly reduce the risk of breech strike. Appropriate
disposal of carcases, which otherwise offer an excellent alternative
breeding place for blowflies, is also recommended.
Lucilia
Description, adults: Lucilia blowflies measure up to 10 mm in length and
are characterised by a metallic greenish to bronze sheen (Fig. 3.49). The
adults are characterised by the presence of a bare stem-vein, bare squamae
and the presence of three pairs of postsutural, dorso-central bristles on the

Adult Lucilia sericata and L. cuprina may be distinguished from most
other species of Lucilia by the presence of a pale creamy-white basicostal
scale at the base of the wing, three postsutural acrostichal bristles on the
thorax and one anterio-dorsal bristle on the tibia of the middle leg-

However, definitive identification to species can only be confirmed using
a small number of subtle morphological features, such as the colour of the
fore femur, the number of paravertical setae present on the back of the
head and, most reliably, the shape of the male genitalia.
Larvae: Larvae are smooth, segmented and measure 10-14 mm in length.
They possess a pair of oral hooks at the anterior extremity, and, at the
posterior, peritremes bearing spiracles (Fig. 3.50)-

epidermis and lymphatic exudates, or on necrotic tissue. They will only
begin to feed on healthy tissue in crowded conditions. The mouth hooks
are used to macerate the tissues, and digestion occurs extra-orally by
means of amylase in the saliva and proteolytic enzymes in the larval
excreta. Mature larvae drop to the ground and pupate. The pupal stage is
completed in 3-7 days in summer. Adult flies can live for about 7 days.
The time required to complete the life cycle from egg to adult is highly
dependent on the ambient temperature but is usually between 2 and 6
weeks.

Pathogenesis: Two species, L. sericata and L. cuprina, are important
primary factulative agents of myiasis. Other species of Lucilia may be
occasional or secondary invaders of established myiases. After the eggs
are deposited on the wool, the larvae emerge and crawl down the wool on
to the skin. They secrete proteolytic enzymes, which digest and liquefy the
tissues. Second- and third-stage larvae may also abrade the skin with their
mouth hooks.
sheep, produce few clinical signs and be difficult to detect without
detailed examination. When the larvae cease feeding and leave the host,
615
the lesions created by such small infestations heal well and usually
without complications (Fig. 3.51).
However, the odour of an existing infestation may attract more blowflies
and induce further oviposition; the high humidity at an active strike lesion
may also enhance egg and larval survival. Hence, once infested, sheep
become far more likely to receive multiple strikes. At the initial lesion site
there may be alopecia and underlying scar tissue formation, while the
lesion spreads from its margins as further ovipositions occur and waves of
larvae feed under the surrounding wool. The irritation and distress caused
by the expanding lesion is extremely debilitating and sheep can rapidly
lose condition.

temperature and respiratory rate. The animals become anaemic and suffer
severe toxaemia, with both kidney and heart tissues affected. The feeding
   s  o    eo 
combination with the larval proteases produced, results in the
development of inflamed, abraded or undermined areas of skin. Infested
616
animals become lethargic, appear depressed and cease feeeding, resulting
in loss of weight and anorexia. If untreated, multiple infestation rapidly
leads to death from toxaemia, usually within about 2 weeks of the initial
infestation, although the precise time required will depend on the intensity
of infestation.
Epidemiology: The epidemiology of cutaneous myiasis in sheep depends
on factors that affect the prevalence of blowflies and those which affect
host susceptibility. The three principal factors are:
1. Temperature. High ambient temperatures allow elevated levels of
fly activity and, provided the relative humidity is also high, favour
the creation of suitable areas of microclimate in the fleece that
attract the adult flies to lay their eggs. In temperate areas, the rising
temperatures of late spring allow overwintering larvae to complete
their development and the first wave of adult blowflies to emerge.
Ambient temperature then determines the number of generations
and, hence, the maximum abundance of flies over the summer.
2. Rainfall. Persistent rain can make the fleece more attractive to the
adult female flies, stimulate oviposition and increase the survival of
the eggs and first-stage larvae, which require areas of high humidity
in the wool to persist.
3. Host susceptibility. This is increased where putrefactive odours,
develop in the fleece. The commonest causes of this are soiling of
due to fighting, especially on the head in rams. Long fleece, long
ails and wrinkled skin folds in some breeds, may also increase host
susceptibility. Foot rot, caused by two anaerobic, Gram-negative
bacteria, Bacteroides nodosus and Fusobacterium necrophorum, is
also an important predisposing factor leading to foot strike.
Lucilia sericata
Synonym: Phaenicia sericata
Common name: Greenbottle, sheep blowfly
Predilection site: Skin, skin wounds
Parasite class: Insecta
617
Family: Calliphoridae
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. Originally Lucilia sericata was
probably endemic to the Palaearctic. However, as a result of natural
patterns of movement and artificial dispersal by humans and livestock in
the past few hundred years the species is now found worldwide. L.
sericata is more common in cool-temperate habitats, such as Europe, and
is often replaced by the closely related Lucilia cuprina in warm-temperate
and subtropical habitats.
Pathogenesis: Blowfly strike by L. sericata occurs most commonly in the

is little recorded involvement of dermatitis in predisposing sheep to strike
by L. sericata in northern Europe. Following initial strike by L. sericata
secondary blowfly species may also invade the site of infestation. These
secondary invaders include other species of Lucilia, Calliphora spp and,
in some regions, Chrysomya spp.

increase with increasing flock size and stocking density, and to decrease
with increasing farm altitude. Initially in spring, unshorn adults may be
most at risk. Immediately following shearing the risk of strike in adult
sheep is considerably reduced. However, the susceptibility of strike in
lambs increases, peaking in late summer as their fleeces grow and as
populations of pasture nematodes increase, against which they have no
acquired immunity, and lead to diarrhoea and faecal soiling. In temperate
areas under summer conditions, up to four generations may develop per
year. In these areas, the final generation overwinters in the soil as larvae,
to emerge as adults in the following spring. The precise timing of spring
dependent. In warmer climates the number of generations per annum is
greater and up to nine or ten have been recorded in southern Africa and
Australia. The period of risk is more prolonged in warm, moist weather
Notes: Lucilia sericata is the most important agent of sheep myiasis
England in the fifteenth century. Lucilia sericata arrived in New Zealand
618
over 1o0 years ago and soon established itself as the primary myiasis fly
in the country, 0ccurring in 75% of all cases of sheep strike. However,
now L. cuprina appears to be displacing L. sericata to become the most
important primary cause of fly strike in sheep in New Zealand.
Lucilia cuprina
Synonym: Phaenicia cuprina, Phaenicia paliescens
Common name: Greenbottle, Australian sheep blowfly
Predilection site: Skin wounds
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Calliphoridae
Geographical distribution: It is thought that the original distribution of
Lucilia cuprina may have been either Afrotropical or Oriental. However,
as a result of natural patterns of movement and artificial dispersal by
humans and livestock in the past few hundred years, the species is now
in
warm-temperate and subtropical habitats. There are believed to be two
sub-species: L.c. cuprina is distributed throughout the Neotropical,
Oriental and southern Nearctic regions, while L.c. dorsalis is found
throughout the sub-Saharan, Afrotropical and Australasian regions.
      snss o  o
intermediate forms are believed to be common. The simple division into
two sub-species is, therefore, certainly an oversimplification of the
complex pattern of genetic variation that occurs between populations of L.
cuprina.
Pathogenesis: In Australia and New Zealand, body strike caused by L.
cuprina is frequently the main form of myiasis. Body strike occurs most
commonly around the shoulders and back region and is frequently
associated with the incidence of bacterial dermatophilosis caused by the
bacterium Dermatophilus congolensis. Body strike in Australasia is also
often associated with bacterial fleece rot; a superficial dermatitis induced
the skin, resulting in a matted band of discoloured fleece. It is possible
that dermatophilosis and fleece rot act synergistically in attracting
619
blowflies and their subsequent oviposition. However, where the Merino

favours the accumulation of urine and faeces.
Following initial strike by Lucilia cuprina a variety of secondary species
may also invade the site of infestation. They frequently extend the injury
rendering the strike one of great severity. These secondary invaders
include Calliphora spp and Chrysomya spp.
Lucilia cuprina is suspected of spreading diseases such as gastroenteritis
and anthrax among host animals.
year have been recorded and L. cuprina may be active all year round in
some parts of its range.
Notes: Lucilia cuprina is absent from most of Europe, although it has
    u   o   
probably introduced into Australia towards the middle or end of the
 s sis r    si    
mainland Australia and Tasmania, present in 90-99% of flystrike cases. In
the early 1980s L. cuprina was discovered in New Zealand and was most
probably introduced from Australia. Now, despite its low abundance, in
northern areas of New Zealand it appears to be displacing L. sericata to
become the most important primary cause of flystrike in sheep.
Lucilia cuprina In is also the primary myiasis fly of sheep in southern
Africa. Although this species had been known in South Africa since 1830,
little sheep strike was recorded until the early decades of the twentieth
century, possibly as a result of the introduction of more susceptible
Merino breeds or changes in husbandry practices.
In North America, L. cuprina (syn. Phaenicia cuprina, Phaenicia
pallescens) is known to be present, although it does not appear to be
important in sheep myiasis.

in length. They possess a pair of oral hooks at the anterior extremity,
620
spiracles on the anterior segment and, posteriorly, spiracular plates. The
arrangement of the posterior spiracles on these plates serves to
differentiate the species.
Life cycle: Flies oviposit primarily in carrion, but also may act as
secondary invaders of myiases on live mammals. The gravid female lays
the larvae then feed, grow rapidly and moult twice to become fully mature
maggots. When they have completed feeding, third-stage larvae migrate to
the ground and pupate. Following pupation the adult female fly must
obtain a protein meal and mate.
Pathogenesis: When involved in myiasis, secondary blowflies are
attracted by the odour of the infestation, and their larvae extend and
deepen the lesion. The irritation and distress caused by the lesion is
extremely debilitating and the host animal can rapidly lose condition. The
latter is often the first obvious sign of strike as the lesion occurs at the skin
surface and is sometimes observed only on close examination.
Epidemiology: Secondary flies usually follow an initial strike by a
primary fly such as Lucilia cuprina and invade the site of infestation.
They frequently extend the injury rendering the strike one of great
severity.

thoracic spiracle is black or black-brown and is difficult to distinguish
from the general body colour. In contrast, in Phormia regina the anterior
spiracle is yellow or orange and stands out clearly against the dark
background colour of the thorax (Fig. 3.53).
Description, larvae: The third-stage larvae of both P. terraenovae and P.
regina are characterised by strongly developed, fairly pointed tubercles on
the posterior face of the last segment. In third-stage larvae of P.
625
terraenovae the tubercles on the upper margin of the last segment are
longer than those of P. regina, being longer than half the width of a

Life cycle: Flies oviposit primarily in carrion, but also may act as
secondary invaders of myiases on live mammals. The gravid female lays
clusters of 100-200 yellowish cream eggs. The eggs hatch into larvae; the
maggots. These then migrate to the ground and pupate. Following
pupation the adult female fly must obtain a protein meal and mate. Adult
flies can live for approximately 30 days.

the anterior thoracic spiracle is black or black-brown and is difficult to
the anterior spiracle is yellow or orange and stands out clearly against the
dark background colour of the thorax.
Description, larvae: The third-stage larvae of both P. terraenovae and P.
regina are characterised by strongly developed, fairly pointed tubercles on
the posterior face of the last segment. In third-stage larvae of P.
terraenovae the tubercles on the upper margin of the last segment are
longer than half the width of a posterior spiracle, whereas in P. regina
they are less than half the width of a posterior spiracle in length. The
larvae of P. terraenovae also possess dorsal spines on the posterior
margins of segment 10 which are absent in larvae of P. regina (Fig. 3.53).
Hosts: Mainly sheep, but may also be a serious pest of cattle and reindeer.
Life cycle: Flies oviposit primarily in carrion but also may act as
secondary invaders of myiases on live mammals. The gravid female lays
627
clusters of 100200 yellowish cream eggs. The eggs hatch into larvae and
the larvae then feed, grow rapidly and moult twice to become fully mature
maggots. These then migrate to the ground and pupate. Following
pupation, the adult female fly must obtain a protein meal and mate. Adult
flies can live for about 30 days.
Geographical distribution: Northern Canada, USA, Europe,
Scandinavia,Russia
A number of other, more generalist ectoparasites may also be found on
sheep and goats and these are listed in the host-parasite checklist at the
end of this chapter. More detailed descriptions of these parasites may be
found in Chapter 11 (Facultative ectoparasites and arthropod vectors).
In the following checklists, the codes listed below apply:
Heiminth classes:
N = Nematoda; T = Trematoda; C = Cestoda.
Arthropod classes:

Parasites of horses
ENDOPARASITES
PARASITES OF THE DIGESTIVE
SYSTEM
OESOPHAGUS
No parasites reported
STOMACH
Members of the genus Habronema, and the closely related genus
Draschia, are parasitic in the stomach of the horse. Habronema inhabits
the mucus layer of the gastric mucosa and may cause a catarrhal gastritis,
but is not considered an important pathogen, while Draschia parasitises
the fundic region of the stomach wall and provokes the formation of large
these parasites is as a cause of cutaneous habronematidosis or ^summer
sores' in warm countries.
Life cycle: The life cycle is similar for all species. Eggs or L1 are passed
in the faeces and the L1 are ingested by the larval stages of various muscid
flies that are often present in faeces. Development to L3 occurs
637
host. When the fly feeds around the mouth, lips and nostrils of the horse.
          s  m
Alternatively infected flies may be swallowed whole in feed and drinking
water. Development to adult takes place in the stomach where the larvae
burrow into the glandular area of the mucosa and induce the formation of
nodules. The worms develop to mature adults within the nodules in about
8 weeks. When Drachsia larvae are deposited on a skin wound or around
the eyes they can invade the tissues; they do not complete their
development but may cause granulomatous skin lesions.
Final hosts: All are parasites of the horse and other equines
Intermediate hosts: Dipteran flies of the genera Musca, Stomoxys and
Haematobia (Lyperosia)
Epidemiology: The seasonality of cutaneous lesions is related to the
activity of the fly vectors.
Treatment: A number of modern broad-spectrum anthelmintics including
oxfendazole, oxibendazole and albendazole have been shown to have
activity against the adult parasites in the stomach. Cutaneous lesions are
best treated with ivermectin. The use of insect repellents has some benefit
and radiation therapy and cryosurgery have been used in more chronic
cases.
Control: Obviously any measures taken to prevent injuries and to control
fly populations will be beneficial. Stacking manure and using insecticides
during the day, for example, limit fly populations and attack. Skin wounds
should be treated with either fly repellents or a combination of antiseptic
and insecticide.
Draschia megastoma
Synonym: Habronema megastoma
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Slender white translucent worms 0.7-1.3 cm long;
adult male are 7-10 mm and females 10-13 mm. The worms are
638
recognised by their heads, which are slightly constricted from the main
body.
Description, microscopic: The pharynx is funnelshaped. The hind end of
the male is usually spirally coiled with four pairs of pre-cloacal papillae.
Spicules are uneven in length with the left longer than the right.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: In the stomach the worms live in colonies in the mucosa
around which develop large nodular fibrous tumour-like lesions (Fig. 4.1)-
These occur in the fundus region and seem to be well tolerated unless they
protrude into the lumen sufficiently to interfere mechanically with
stomach function or, more rarely, cause abcessation or perforation when
the lesions become secondarily infected with pyogenic bacteria. D.
megastoma can cause a skin reaction, cutaneous habronematidosis or
summer sores', when larvae are deposited on broken skin or open wounds
by infected flies.
Draschia megastoma infection.
Clinical signs: The presence of adult worms in the stomach causes very
little clinical disturbance. Cutaneous habronematidosis presents as intense
itching of the affected skin. Non-healing granulomatous lesions, raised
above the surface of the skin may be a feature (see Habronema).
639
Diagnosis: Usually only low numbers of eggs or larvae are present in the
       
tube. Sometimes larvae can be identified in the small granulomatous skin
lesions.
Pathology: Adult worms burrow into the submucosa of the stomach
producing large tumour-like nodules causing the mucosa to protrude into
the gastric lumen. The worms provoke a surrounding granulomatous
reaction, which contains a central core of necrotic and cellular debris and
large numbers of eosinophils. Burrowing larvae in the conjunctivae cause
an ulcerative, weeping lesion at the medial canthus, which becomes
progressively more nodular as the lesion becomes more granulomatous.
Mineralised granules, caseous debris and larvae may be found in the
lesion. Larvae in the skin cause lesions that are rapidly progressive and
proliferative in nature, comprising ulcerated masses of granulation tissue
that haemorrhages readily. Lesions may be single or multiple and range in
size from 5-15 cm. On section, the lesions are caseous and histologically
there are aggregates of eosinophils scattered throughout the connective
tissue, which contains a few macrophages and multinucleate giant cells
surrounding degenerating larvae. The surface of the lesion is usually
covered with a fibronecrotic exudate overlying a highly vascular
granulation tissue infiltrated with neutrophils.
Habronema microstoma
Synonym: Habronema majus
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Slender white translucent worms 1.5-2.5 cm long:
adult males are 16-22 mm and females 15-25 mm. The male has wide
caudal alae and the tail has a spiral twist.
Description, microscopic: The pharynx contains a dorsal and ventral
tooth in its anterior part. The male has four pairs of pre-cloacal papillae.
 
640
right. The elongated, 0val, small eggs are thin-shelled, 45-59 x 16 μm and
larvated when shed in faeces.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The adult Habronema in the stomach may cause a mild
catarrhal gastritis with excess mucus production. More important are the
granulomatous lesions of cutaneous habronematidosis, commonly known
as ‘summer sores', and the persistent conjunctivitis with nodular
thickening and ulceration of the eyelids associated with invasion of the
eyes. Larvae have also been found associated with small lung abscesses.
Lesions of cutaneous habronematidosis are most common in areas of the
body liable to injury and occur during the fly season in warm humid
countries, although it also occurs in temperate regions. During the early
stages, there is intense itching of the infected wound or abrasion, which
may cause further self-inflicted damage. Subsequently a reddish brown,
non-healing cauliflower-like granuloma develops that protrudes above the
level of the surrounding skin and may be up to 8.0 cm in diameter. These
lesions are known as ^summer sores’ in acute cases. Later the lesion may
become more chronic, fibrous and inactive, but will not heal until the
 
at the medial canthus. Sometimes larvae invade the skin of the prepuce
and glans penis of stallions.
Diagnosis: This is based on the finding of nonhealing, reddish cutaneous
granulomas. The larvae, recognised by spiny knobs on their tails, may be
found in material from these lesions. Gastric infection is not easily
diagnosed since Habronema eggs and larvae are not readily demonstrable
in the faeces by routine techniques.

Pathology: Adult worms in the mucosa of the stomach have been
associated with a mild ulceration. Burrowing larvae in the conjunctivae
cause an ulcerative, weeping lesion at the medial canthus, which becomes
 progressively more nodular as the lesion becomes more granulomatous.
Habronema muscae
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Slender white translucent worms, 1.0-2.5 cm long:
adult males are 8-14 mm and females 13-22 mm. The male has wide
caudal alae and the tail has a spiral twist. It is unlikely to be confused with
other nematodes in the stomach since Draschia is associated with
characteristic lesions and Trichostrongyius axei is less than 1.0 cm in
length.
Description, microscopic: There are two lateral trilobed lips; the pharynx
is cylindrical and has a thick cuticular lining. There are four pairs of
pre-cloacal papillae and one or two papillae behind the cloaca. The cloacal
region is covered with small cuticlar ridges. Spicules are uneven in length
with the slender left one longer than the right. The vulva is situated near
the middle of the body and opens dorsolaterally. The elongated, oval,
642
small eggs are thin-shelled, 40-50 × 10-12 μm and larvated when shed in
faeces.

difficult to see with the naked eye. Males measure around 3-6 mm and
females 4-8 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: The male spicules are dissimilar and unequal

Gasterophilus
Species of Gasterophilus, known as bots, are obligate parasites of horses,
donkeys, mules, zebras, elephants and rhinoceroses. Nine species are
recognised in total, six of which are of interest as veterinary parasites of
sp!nba
Description, adults: Bot flies are robust dark flies, 10-15 mm in length
(Fig. 4.3). The body is densely covered with yellowish hairs. In the female
the ovipositor is strong and protuberant. The wings of adult Gasterophilus
characteristically have no cross-vein dm-cu (Fig. 4.4).

Fig. 4.7 Gasterophiius larvae in the stomach of a horse.
Clinical signs: Burrowing of the first-stage larvae in the mouth lining,
tongue and gums can produce pus pockets, loosen teeth and cause loss of
appetite in the host. Larvae attached to the gastrointestinal mucosa cause
648
avoidance reactions when hovering around the host and laying eggs on the
as stationary animals. Females will pursue galloping horses and
immediately resume oviposition when the horse stops.
Diagnosis: The adult flies may be visible and recognisable on and around
the host. The eggs are also easily recognisable on the host and may be
be detected. The presence of larval parasites in the stomach is difficult to
identify except by observation of the larvae in faeces.
Pathology: The burrowing of first- and second-stage Gasterophiius larvae
in the tissues of the tongue and mouth may result in lesions, the
Active tunnelling removes virtually all tissue in the path of the larvae
including nerves and capillaries leading to haemorrhage and exocytosis
into the tunnels, which fill with erythrocytes mixed with macrophages,
lymphocytes and some eosinophils. The tunnels may become infected
with bacteria, which result in microabscesses, composed of clotted
erythrocytes, bacteria, disintegrating epithelial cells and large numbers of
neutrophils. Cells surrounding the tunnel exhibit pyknosis, epithelial
hydropic degeneration and became separated from each other.
Interdental gingiva invaded by larvae appear hyperaemic and denuded of

and dichlorvos, but these have generally been replaced by broad-spectrum
macrocyclic lactone compounds, such as ivermectin and moxidectin.
Control: The most effective means of control of this parasite is to remove
the eggs from the host's coat. This requires, where possible, daily
649
examination of the animal, paying particular attention to the area around
the lips. If eggs are found during the summer and autumn, subsequent

containing an insecticide. The warmth stimulates hatching and the
insecticide kills the newly hatched larvae.
From the life cycle it is clear that in temperate areas during the winter
almost the entire Gasterophiius population will be present as larvae in the
stomach, since adult fly activity ceases with the advent of the first frosts in
autumn. A single treatment during the winter, therefore, should effectively
break the cycle. In certain areas, where adult fly activity is prolonged by
mild conditions, additional treatments may be required. Despite the lack of
understanding of the pathogenic effect of bots, treatment is usually
recommended as owners are concerned when larvae appear in the faeces.
Treatment, however, does reduce fly populations and thus the fly worry
associated with egg-laying.
Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis
Common name: Bot flies
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
Description: In G. haemorrhoidalis, the spines on the ventral surface of
the larval segments are arranged in two rows. The head segment has only
lateral groups of denticles and the dorsal row of spines on the eighth
segment is not broadly interrupted medially. The mouth hooks are
q a (t ) Ael po pe As pao A
spines are sharply pointed.
Hosts: Horse, donkey
Life cycle: G. haemorrhoidalis lays batches of 150-200 eggs around the
lips. The adult flies have a short lifespan and females can deposit all of
their eggs within 2-3 hours if the weather is mild and a suitable host is
available. The eggs are easily seen: they are l-2 mm long and usually
black in colour. They either hatch spontaneously in about 5 days or are
stimulated to do so by warmth, which may be generated during licking
650
and self-grooming. Larvae either crawl into the mouth or are transferred to
the tongue during licking. The larvae can burrow into the epidermis of the
lips and from there migrate into the mouth. These then penetrate the
tongue or buccal mucosa and burrow through in these tissues for several
    s      sm
oesophagus to the stomach where they attach to the gastric epithelium.
The larvae remain and develop in the stomach for periods of 10-12
months. When mature in the following spring or early summer, they
detach and are passed in the faeces. In this species, the larvae reattach in
the ground, and after 1-2 months the adult flies emerge. These do not
feed, and live for only a few days or weeks, during which time they mate
and lay eggs. If suitable hosts are unavailable the flies move to high points
to aggregate and mate, following which the females initiate a
longer-distance search for hosts. There is therefore only one generation of
flies per year in temperate areas.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Gasterophilus inermis
Common name: Bot flies
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
Description: In G. inermis the spines on the ventral surface of the larval
segments are arranged in two rows. The head segment has only lateral
groups of denticles and the dorsal row of spines on the eighth segment are
       g a o
with their tips directed backwards and approaching the base (Fig. 4.6b)
The body spines are sharply pointed. Body segment 3 has three complete

Hosts: Horse, donkey, zebra
Life cycle: The adult female lays up to 300 eggs on the cheeks and around
the mouth of the host animal. These are each attached individually to the
651
length and usually creamy white in colour. The eggs either hatch
spontaneously in about 5 days or are stimulated to do so by warmth, which
may be generated during licking and self-grooming. After hatching, the
larvae burrow into the epidermis, and migrate towards the mouth. The
migration route of the larvae can be detected by the presence of a track
mouth and penetrate the mucous membranes of the cheek. The second-
and third-stage larvae migrate to the rectum where they reattach. The
larvae remain and develop in the host for periods of 10-12 months. When
mature in the following spring or early summer, they detach and are
passed in the faeces. Pupation takes place on the ground, and after 1-2
months the adult flies emerge. These do not feed and live for only a few
days or weeks, during which time they mate and lay eggs. There is
therefore only one generation of flies per year in temperate areas.

stimulated to do so by warmth, which may be generated during licking
and self-grooming. Larvae either crawl into the mouth or are transferred to
the tongue during licking. These then penetrate the tongue or buccal
mucosa at the anterior end of the tongue where they excavate galleries in

the sub-epithelial layer of the mucous membrane. The larvae wander in
these tissues for several weeks before exiting the tongue and moulting.
Second-stage larvae attach for a few days to the sides of the pharynx,
cluster at the boundary of glandular and non-glandular epithelium. Larvae
remain and develop in this site for periods of 10-12 months. When mature
in the following spring or early summer, they detach and are passed in the
faeces. Pupation takes place on the ground and after 1-2 months the adult

or less conical and the third segment has a dorsal row of spines and
sometimes ventral spines (Fig. 4.6c).
Hosts: Horse, donkey and zebra
Life cycle: The throat bot fly, G. nasalis, lays its eggs in the
intermandibular area. Eggs are laid in batches of up to 500, usually with
one egg attached per hair. The eggs are easily seen, being 1-2 mm in
length and usually  creamy  white in colour.  Eggs either hatch
spontaneously in about 7 days or are stimulated to do so by warmth, which
may be generated during licking and self-grooming. Larvae either crawl
into the mouth or are transferred to the tongue during licking. These then
burrow into the spaces around the teeth and between the teeth and gums.
This may result in the development of pus sockets and necrosis in the
gums. The first larval stage lasts 18-24 days, following which larvae

Gasterophiluspecorum
Common name: Bot flies, dark-winged horse bot
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
Description: G. pecorum has spines on the ventral surface of the larval
           
lateral groups of denticles and one central group, the latter situated
between the antennal lobes and mouth hooks. The dorsal rows of spines
are broadly interrupted medially on the 7th and 8th segments. The 10th
and 1 lth segments have no spines.
Hosts: Horse, donkey
Life cycle: Adult G. pecorum are most active in late summer and unlike
other species, the dark-coloured eggs are laid on pasture and are ingested
by horses during grazing. Up to 2000 eggs are laid in batches of 10-115.
The eggs are highly resistant and the developed larva may remain viable
for months within its egg until ingested by horses. In the mouth, the eggs
hatch within 3-5 minutes. First-stage larvae immediately penetrate the
mucous membrane of the lips, gums, cheeks, tongue and hard palate and
burrow towards the root of the tongue and soft palate, where they may
remain for 9-l0 months until fully developed. They may also be
swallowed and settle in the walls of the pharynx, oesophagus or stomach.
When mature in the following spring or early summer, the larvae detach
and are passed in the faeces. Pupation takes place on the ground and after
1-2 months the adult flies emerge. These do not feed and live for only a
few days or weeks, during which time they mate and lay eggs. There is
therefore only one generation of flies per year in temperate areas.
Geographical distribution: Europe, Africa, Asia

655
constriction of the oesophagus.
Clinical signs: Burrowing of the first-stage larvae in the mouth lining,
tongue and gums can produce pus pockets, loosen teeth and cause loss of
appetite in the host. Large numbers of attached larvae can cause
inflammation, choking and hinder swallowing.
Diagnosis: Larvae present in the pharynx can usually be seen on direct
inspection. Larvae further down the digestive tract can only be detected by
observation of the mature detached larvae in faeces.
SMALLINTESTINE
Strongyloides westeri
Common name: Threadworm
Predilection site: Small intestine

are parasitic.
Description, microscopic: The long oesophagus may occupy up to one
third of the body length and the uterus is intertwined with the intestine
giving the appearance of twisted thread. Unlike other intestinal parasites
of similar size the tail has a blunt point. Strongyloides eggs are oval,
thin-shelled and small, 40-52 × 32-40 μm, being half the size of typical

 Oedema and erosion of the epithelium. This results in catarrhal enteritis
with impairment of digestion and absorption. Migration of larvae through
the lungs can cause severe haemorrhage and respiratory distress. Skin
penetration may result in irritation and dermatitis.
Clinical signs: Foals with heavy burdens show acute diarrhoea, weakness
and emaciation. Older animals may harbour large burdens without
showing clinical signs.
Diagnosis: The clinical signs in very young animals, usually within the
first few weeks of life, together with the finding of large numbers of the
characteristic eggs or larvae in  the  faeces are suggestive of

humid environments. Strongyloides infective larvae are not ensheathed
and are susceptible to extreme climatic conditions. However, warmth and
moisture  favour development and allow the accumulation of large
numbers of infective stages. A second major source of infection for the
very young animal is the reservoir of larvae in the tissues of their dams
and this may lead to clinical strongyloidosis in foals in the first few weeks
of life.Successive progeny from the same damoften showheavy
infections.
Treatment: Specific control measures for infection are rarely called for.
Not all anthelmintics show high efficacy, but most of the modern
benzimidazoles are effective. Macrocyclic lactones are effective against
against adult worms.
Control: Reduction in numbers of free-living larvae by removal of faeces
transmission. On stud farms, foals are often given an anthelmintic
treatment at 1-2 weeks of age against S. westeri.

Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
40 cm in length, cannot be confused with any other intestinal parasite of
equines. Males measure 15-25 cm and females up to 40 cm
658
Description, microscopic: The adult parasites have a simple mouth
opening surrounded by three large lips and in the male the tail has small
caudal alae. The dorsa lip has two double papillae and each ventrolateral
lip has one double subventral, and a small lateral papilla. Spicules are long
and stout. The egg of P. equorum is almost spherical, 50-75 × 40-50 μm,
brownish and thick-shelled with an outer, pitted coat.
Hosts: Horse, donkey
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct and migratory involving a
  a  ss  e    s   
as little as 10-14 days, although development may be delayed at low
temperatures. After ingestion and hatching the larvae penetrate the
intestinal wall and within 48 hours have reached the liver. By 2 weeks
they have arrived in the lungs where they migrate up the bronchi and
trachea, are swallowed and return to the small intestine. The site of
occurrence and timing of the parasitic larval moults of P. equorum are not
precisely known, but it would appear that the moult from L2 to L3 occurs
between the intestinal mucosa and the liver and the two subsequent moults
occur in the small intestine. The minimum prepatent period of P. equorum
is 10 weeks; longevity is up to 2 years. There is no evidence of prenatal
infection.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: During the migratory phase of experimental infections, up
to 4 weeks following infection, the major signs are frequent coughing,
foals remain bright and alert. Light intestinal infections are well tolerated,
but moderate to heavy infections will cause unthriftiness in young animals
with poor growth rates, dull coats and lassitude. A wide variety of other
clinical signs, including fever, nervous disturbances and colic, has been
attributed to field cases of parascariosis, but these have not been observed
in experimental studies.
Clinical signs: Adult worms in heavy infections can cause severe enteritis
numbers of larvae may cause coughing, with fever and anorexia
659
Diagnosis: This depends on clinical signs and the presence of spherical,
thick, brownish, rough-shelled eggs on faecal examination. Occasionally,
atypical thick-walled eggs are seen that lack the dark outer shell. If disease
negative, diagnosis may be confirmed by administration of an
 a q        
thefaeces.
Pathology: Gross changes are provoked in the liver and lungs by
migrating P. equorum larvae. In the liver, larvae cause focal haemorrhages
and eosinophilic tracts that resolve, leaving whitish areas of fibrosis.
Larval migration in the lungs also leads to haemorrhage and infiltration by
eosinophils, which are later replaced by accumulations of lymphocytes.
while subpleural greyish green lymphocytic nodules develop around dead
or dying larvae; these nodules are more numerous following reinfection
These liver and lung lesions are usually of little pathological significance.
Although the presence of worms in the small intestine (Fig. 4.9) is not
associated with any specific lesions, heavy infections have occasionally
been reported as a cause of impaction and perforation leading to
peritonitis. Adult worms may cause catarrhal enteritis and intermittent
diarrhoea. However, under experimental conditions, unthriftiness is a
major sign and despite maintaining a good appetite infected foals lose
weight and may become emaciated. Competition between a large mass of
parasites and the host for nutrients may be the underlying cause of this
weight loss.

the world and is a major cause of unthriftiness in young foals. There are
fecundity of the adult female parasite, some infected foals passing
millions of eggs in the faeces each day. Secondly, the extreme resistance
of the egg in the environment ensures its persistence for several years. The
sticky nature of the outer shell may also facilitate passive spread of eggs.
In the northern hemisphere, summer temperatures are such that many eggs
become infective at a time when a population of susceptible foals is
 present. The infections acquired by these result in further contamination of
pasture with eggs which may survive during several subsequent grazing
seasons. Although mature horses may harbour a few adult worms and act
as carriers, heavy burdens are usually confined to yearlings and to foals,
which become infected from the first month or so of life; infection is
young animals. Exposed foals often develop immunity, resulting in partial
or total loss of the worm population.
661
Treatment:  Benzimidazoles  (such  as  fenbendazole,  oxfendazole
oxibendazole), pyrantel, ivermectin and moxidectin are all effective
against adult and larval stages when given orally.
Control: Since transmission is largely on a foal-to-foal basis it is good
policy to avoid using the same paddocks for nursing mares and their foals
in successive years. Treatment should start when foals are about 8 weeks
old and be repeated at appropriate intervals depending on the anthelmintic
used.
Notes: Infection with Parascaris equorum is common throughout the
world and is a major cause of unthriftiness in young foals
Tapeworms
Several tapeworm species are found in horses, donkeys and other equines.
          
Oribatidae, in which the intermediate cysticercoid stages are found.
Life cycle: Mature segments are passed in the faeces and disintegrate,
releasing the eggs. These are ingested by forage mites in which they
found in the intestine of horses 1 or 2 months after the ingestion of
infected mites in the herbage.
Diagnosis: Where clinical signs occur they may be difficult to
upsets. However, it may be possible to confirm the presence of
Anoplocephala by the demonstration of the typical eggs on faecal
examination or on postmortem.
Epidemiology: Horses of all ages may be affected, but clinical cases have
been reported mainly in animals up to 3-4 years of age.
Treatment: Specific treatment for Anoplocephala infection is rarely
including pyrantel at increased dosage rates (38 mg/kg). Praziquantel at 1
mg/kg is also effective.
Control: Control is difficult, since forage mites are widespread on
pasture. Treatment with an effective anthelmintic before the animals enter
662
new grazing may help to control Anoplocephala infections in areas where
problems have arisen.

obstruction and perforation of the intestinal wall have been recorded
associated with massive infections.

catarrhal, haemorrhagic or ulcerative enteritis. Cases of intestinal
obstruction, colic and perforation of the intestinal wall have been recorded
associated with massive infections.
Clinical signs: Rare, but infection causes diarrhoea and colic.
Pathology: The mucosa at the site of attachment may be inflamed,
thickened and ulcerated.

Pathology: Infection is rarely associated with lesions but occasionally the
site of attachment is inflamed and slightly ulcerated.
Epidemiology: Horses of all ages may be affected.
Coccidiosis
Several species of coccidia have been reported from horses. Few details
are available on the life cycles, pathogenesis and epidemiology and
pathogenesis. Similarly, little is also known about treatment and control of
equine coccidiosis, but by analogy with other hosts, sulphonamides can be
tried. Prevention is based on good management and hygiene. Young
animals should be kept off heavily contaminated pastures when they are
most susceptible. Good feeding of dams prior to parturition and rearing of
animals of similar ages limits the build-up and spread of oocysts.
Eimeria leuckarti
Synonym: Globidium leuckarti
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Host: Horse, donkey
Description: Oocysts are ovoid or pyriform, flattened at the small end and
very large, measuring 70-90 × 49-69 μm (mean 80 × 60 μm), with a thick
dark shell and distinct micropyle. Sporocysts are elongate, 3043 × 12-15
μm, with a Stieda body and residuum. The sporozoites are up to 35 μm
long, lie lengthwise head to tail in the sporocysts and have a clear globule
at the broad end.
Life cycle: Complete details of the life cycle are not known and merogony
stages have not been described. Early gamonts are in the cells of the
intestinal lamina propria of the small intestine. The prepatent period is
15-33 days and sporulation time is 15-41 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
666
Pathogenesis: Occurs in the small intestine of horses and donkeys and has
been incriminated as the cause of an intermittent diarrhoea.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is difficult, and because of the heavy nature of the
oocysts, sedimentation techniques should be employed or, if flotation is
used, a concentrated sugar solution is necessary.
Pathology: The pathology includes marked inflammatory changes in the
mucosa and a disruption of villous architecture due to the presence of
large meront stages (Fig. 4.11).

Description: Mature 0ocysts are ovoidal or spheroidal, 5.0 x 4.5 μm
(range 4.6-5.4 × 3.8-4.7 μm) and a length: width ratio of 1.19.
668
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Cryptosporidiosis has been reported in immunodeficient
foals as a cause of diarrhoea.
Clinical signs: Clinically the disease is characterised by anorexia and
diarrhoea.
Epidemiology: Several mammals act as hosts to C. parvum but little is
or maintaining infection in domestic livestock. In the UK, surveys in
horses have shown the presence of C. parvum in 28% of thoroughbred
foals although there was no association between infection and diarrhoea.
Subsequent studies have demonstrated the genotype in horses to be
genotype 2.
Treatment: There is no known effective drug therapy, and where
cryptosporidiosis is diagnosed, supportive treatment, in the form of
antidiarrhoeals and fluids, is usually sufficient.

Description: The trophozoite has a pyriform to ellipsoidal, bilaterally
symmetrical body, 12-15 μm long by 5-9 μm wide. The dorsal side is
convex and there is a large sucking disk on the ventral side. There are two
anterior nuclei, two slender axostyles, eight flagellae in four pairs and a
pair of darkly staining median bodies. The median bodies are curved bars
resembling the claws of a hammer. Cysts are ovoid, 8-12 × 7-10 μm and
contain four nuclei.
Hosts: Man, cattle, sheep, goat, pig, horse, alpaca, dog, cat, guinea pig,
chinchilla
669
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infection in horses is considered non-pathogenic
Clinical signs: No associated clinical signs
Treatment and control: Not required
Notes: There is still controversy over the classification of Giardia spp.
The current molecular classification places isolates into eight distinct
assemblages. Some authors give separate specific names to organisms
isolated from different hosts although species specificity of many isolates
is unknown. Phylogenetic data suggest that G. intestinalis is a species
complex composed of several species that are host specific.

LARGEINTESTINE
Cyathostomins ('small strongyles')
The group ^small strongyles’ embraces over 40 species, popularly known
as trichonemes, cyathostomes or cyathostomins. For many years there has
been a great deal of confusion in the classification of this group of
parasites and in a new revision it has been proposed that the genus
Trichonema be discarded and replaced by four main genera, namely
Cyathostomum, Cylicocycius, Cylicodontophorus and Cylicostephanus,
cyathostomins. Other genera of unknown significance included in this
group are Poteriostomum, Craterostomum and Oesophagodontus. Since
the majority of species involved are similar both morphologically and in
behaviour they will be referred to in this text as cyathostomins or small
strongyles. Fifteen species of small strongyles are commonly present in
large numbers.
The following general descriptions apply to all species of small
strongyles.
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Small  strongyles are extremely
prevalent, and grazing horses usually carry a mixed burden of large and
small strongyles. The major clinical signs associated with heavy infections
670
in animals up to 2-3 years of age are unthriftiness, anaemia and
sometimes diarrhoea. Marked clinical signs are less common in older
animals, although general performance may be impaired. In temperate
countries an acute syndrome of catarrhal and/or haemorrhagic enteritis
with severe diarrhoea, leading to emaciation and in some cases death, in
horses and ponies in the spring has been reported; this is associated with
the simultaneous mass emergence of cyathostome L4 from the intestinal
mucosa and submucosa. This may have aetiological and epidemiological
similarities to type [I ostertagiosis in young cattle and is often referred to
as acute larval cyathostomosis.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on the grazing history and clinical signs of
loss of condition and anaemia. Although the finding of typical, oval,
 pi as e a  uxa g uo s as lrs
diagnosis, it is important to remember that substantial worm burdens may
(epg) due either to low fecundity of adult worms, the long prepatent

intestinal mucosa using the transmural illumination technique. On some
occasions when heavy cyathostome infections in the spring cause severe
diarrhoea, thousands of bright red cyathostome L4, apparently unable to
establish, may be present in the faeces.
Fig. 4.12 Developing small strongyle larvae in the mucosa of the caecum.
671
Pathology: Parasitic larval development of most species takes place
entirely in the mucosa of the caecum and colon, but a few penetrate the
muscularis and develop in the submucosa. The entry of larval
cyathostomes (Fig. 4.12) into the lumina of the tubular glands generally
        
hypertrophy. Emergence of the bright red L4 into the gut lumen appears to
be associated with a massive infiltration of the gut mucosa with
eosinophils. Many thousand L4 may be present, but their pathogenic
significance has been little studied. There are, however, reports of heavy
haemorrhagic enteritis, with thickening and oedema of the mucosa,
especially in animals of 6 months to 3 years of age.
Mature parasites are frequently present in large numbers in the lumen of
the large intestine; during feeding those species with small buccal capsules
layers of the mucosa. Although the erosions caused by individual parasites
may be slight, when large numbers are present a desquamative enteritis
mayresult.
Epidemiology: Strongylosis is most frequently a problem in young horses
reared on permanent horse pastures, although cases of severe disease may
overcrowding and poor management. Although the preparasitic larval
requirements of the horse strongyles are similar to those of the
trichostrongyles of ruminants, adult horses, unlike cattle, may carry
substantial worm burdens and therefore have a considerable influence on
the epidemiology of infection. Thus there are two sources of infection
n a an r sea n un s nz a 
larvae, which developed during the previous grazing season and have
source of infective larvae are the eggs passed in the current grazing season
by horses, including nursing mares, sharing the same grazing area. Pasture
larval levels increase markedly during the summer months when
environmental conditions are optimal for rapid development of eggs to L3
and may lead to the accumulation of large infections in the autumn.
At present there is little evidence for a consistent periparturient rise in
faecal egg output in breeding mares due to a relaxation of immunity, since

and is often unrelated to parturition.
There is increasing evidence that many cyathostome L3 ingested during
the autumn show a degree of hypobiosis and remain in the large intestinal
mucosa until the following spring. Mass emergence of these larvae results
in the severe clinical signs described previously
prophylactic measures are adequate. There are several broad-spectrum
anthelmintics, including the benzimidazoles, pyrantel and the avermectins/
lumen-dwelling adult and larval strongyles and these are usually marketed
         s
additional advantage of activity against  larvae of horse bot flies
(Gasterophilus spp), which develop in the stomach. Some modern
benzimidazoles and macrocyclic lactones are also efficient against both
developing cyathostome larvae in the gut wall and some migrating stages
of the large strongyles.
Control: Since horses of any age can become infected and excrete eggs,
all grazing animals over 2 months of age should be treated every 48
weeks with an effective broad-spectrum anthelmintic. This regimen will
also control infections with other intestinal parasites such as Parascaris
should receive an anthelmintic and be isolated for 48-72 hours before
being introduced. If possible, a paddock rotation system should be adopted

successive years. Avoid overstocking.
anthelmintic effective against larval cyathostomes will reduce the risk of
disease due to their mass emergence in the spring.
There is evidence that some species of cyathostomes are becoming
resistant to benzimidazole compounds, pyrantel and piperizine, and to
avoid this it is suggested that these should be used strategically alternated
with chemically unrelated anthelmintics on an annual or a 6-monthly
basis. Faecal samples from groups of horses should be examined at regular
intervals to monitor drug efficiency.

sweeping) or the alternate grazing of pasture by ruminant livestock.

Large strongyles
Members of the genus Strongyius live in the large intestine of horses and
donkeys and, with Triodontophorus, are commonly known as the large
strongyles. Since members of these genera form only one component of
the total parasitic burdens of the large intestine of the horse, general
aspects on their epidemiology, treatment and control have been described
under the general introduction to small strongyles
Diagnosis of these migratory species is difficult during the migratory
prepatent phase and is based on grazing history and clinical signs. Due to
the long prepatent period, clinically apparent strongylosis may be
associated with no, or low, faecal egg counts. Species or generic diagnosis
is not usually required but may be undertaken by specialist laboratories
based on morphology of larvae or adult worms.

the intestinal mucosa (Fig. 4.14). The well developed buccal capsule of
the adult parasite is prominent, as is the bursa of the male. Male are
2.3-2.8 cm in size and females 3.3-4.4 cm. The head end is wider than the

687
Hosts:Horse, donkey
Fig. 4.14 Strongyius edentatus feeding on the mucosa of the large
intestine.
Life cycle: The adult parasites live in the caecum and colon. Eggs, which
resemble those of the trichostrongyles, are passed in the faeces and
development from egg to the L3 under summer conditions in temperate
climates requires approximately 2 weeks. Infection is by ingestion of the
L3. Subsequently, parasitic larval development of the three species of
Strongylus differs and will be dealt with separately.
After penetration of the intestinal mucosa L3 travel via the portal system,
and reach the liver parenchyma within a few days. About 2 weeks later the
moult to L4 takes place, further migration then occurs in the liver and, by
6-8 weeks post-infection, larvae can be found subperitoneally around the
         
many sites with a predilection for the flanks and hepatic ligaments. The
final moult occurs after 4 months and each Ls then migrates, still
subperitoneally, to the wall of the large intestine where a large purulent
nodule is formed, which subsequently ruptures with release of the young
adult parasite into the lumen. The prepatent period is 10-12 months.

Strongylusequinus
Common name: Large strongyles
689
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Strongyloidea
Family: Strongylidae
Subfamily: Strongylinae
Description, gross: Robust dark red worms which are easily seen against
the intestinal mucosa. The well developed buccal capsule of the adult
parasite is prominent as is the bursa of the male. Male are 2.6-3.5 cm in
size and females 3.8-4.7 cm. The head end is not marked off from the rest
of the body.
Description, microscopic: Species differentiation is based on size and the
buccal capsule is oval in outline and there are external and internal leaf
bifid tip and two smaller sub-ventral teeth (Fig. 4.15b). The dorsal
oesophageal gland opens into the buccal capsule through a number of
pores situated in a thickened ridge, the dorsal gutter, formed by the wall of
the buccal capsule. The male has two simple, slender spicules. In the
female, the vulva lies 12-14 mm from the posterior extremity. Eggs are
0val, 75-92 × 41-54 μm, and thin-shelled.
Hosts: Horse, donkey
Life cycle: The adult parasites live in the caecum and colon. The
free-living phase is as described for S. edentatus. Of the three Strongylus
species, least is known of the larval migration of S. equinus. It appears that
the L3 lose their sheaths while penetrating the wall of the caecum and
ventral colon and within 1 week provoke the formation of nodules in the
muscular and subserosal layers of the intestine. The moult to L4 occurs
within these nodules and the larvae then travel across the peritoneal cavity
to the liver where they migrate within the parenchyma for 6 weeks or
more. After this time, L4 and Ls have been found in and around the
pancreas before their appearance in the large intestinal lumen. The
prepatent period is 8-9 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
690
Pathogenesis: Despite the invasive behaviour of the parasitic larval
stages, little specific pathogenic effect can be attributed to them. There has
been little work on the pathogenesis of migrating larvae of S. equinus. For
details of the pathogenesis of infection with adult worms see S. vuigaris.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea, fever, oedema, anorexia, depression and weight

Strongylus vulgaris
Common name: Large strongyles
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Strongyloidea
Family: Strongylidae
Subfamily: Strongylinae
Description, gross: Robust dark red worms which are easily seen against
the intestinal mucosa. The well developed buccal capsule of the adult
parasite is prominent as is the bursa of the male. Male are 14-l6 mm in
size and females 20-24 mm. The head end is not marked off from the rest
of the body.
Description, microscopic: Species differentiation is based on size and the
    go         
buccal capsule is oval in outline and contains two ear-shaped teeth at its
 ne p a s gl a o s a (sit ) 
distal extremities. The dorsal oesophageal gland opens into the buccal
capsule through a number of pores situated in a thickened ridge, the dorsal
691
gutter, formed by the wall of the buccal capsule. Eggs are oval, 83-93 x
48-52 mm, and thin-shelled.
Hosts:Horse,donkey
Life cycle: The adult parasites live in the caecum and colon. The
free-living phase is as described for S. edentatus. Following ingestion, the
L3 penetrate the intestinal mucosa and moult to L4 in the submucosa 7
days later. These then enter small arteries and migrate on the endothelium
to their predilection site in the cranial mesenteric artery and its main
branches. After a period of development of several months the larvae
moult to Ls and return to the intestinal wall via the arterial lumina.
Nodules are formed around the larvae mainly in the wall of the caecum
and colon when, due to their size, they can travel no further within the
arteries and subsequent rupture of these nodules releases the young adult
parasites into the lumen of the intestine. The prepatent period is 6-7
months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Strongyius vuigaris is less common than it was 20 years
ago in many countries, but is still the most significant and pathogenic
nematode parasitic in horses. Larval forms cause endoarteritis in the
mesenteric circulation, resulting in colic and thromboembolic infarction of
the large bowel, while the adults cause anaemia and ill-thrift. Much of the
a   q s sa   
infection of foals. A few weeks after infection with several hundred L3, a
clinical syndrome of fever, inappetence and dullness occurs, sometimes
accompanied by colic. At necropsy, these signs are associated with
arteritis and thrombosis of intestinal blood vessels, with subsequent
infarction and necrosis of areas of bowel. However, a syndrome of this
severity is not commonly reported in foals under naturalconditions.
probably because larval intake is continuous during grazing; it has been
administered in small doses over a long period.
The pathogenesis of infection with adult worms is associated with damage
to the large intestinal mucosa due to the feeding habits of the worms and,
to some extent, to the disruption caused by emergence of young adults
into the intestine  following completion of  their parasitic larval
development. These worms have large buccal capsules and feed by
692
ingestion of plugs of mucosa as they move over the surface of the
the incidental damage to blood vessels can cause considerable
haemorrhage. Ulcers, which result from these bites, eventually heal,
leaving small circular scars. The effects of infection with the adult worms
have not been quantified, but the gross damage and subsequent loss of
blood and tissue fluids is certainly partly responsible for the unthriftiness
and anaemia associated with intestinal helminthosis in the horse.
Clinical signs: Anaemia, poor condition and performance, varying
degrees of colic, temporary lameness, intestinal stasis, rarely intestinal
rupture and death.
Diagnosis: Colic due to verminous arteritis may be associated with a
palpable, painful enlargement at the root of the mesentery.
Pathology: Lesions due to migrating larvae are most common in the
cranial mesenteric artery and its main branches (Fig. 4.16), and consist of
thrombus formation provoked by larval damage to the endothelium,
together with a marked inflammation and thickening of the arterial wall
(Fig. 4.17). True aneurysms with dilatation and thinning of the arterial
wall, although uncommon, may be found, especially in animals which
have experienced repeated infection.

Triodontophorus
Members of the genus Triodontophorus are non-migratory, large
strongyles frequently found in large numbers in the colon and contribute
to the deleterious effects of mixed strongyle infection.

lumen of the caecum and large colon. After fertilisation the gravid female
migrates to the anus, extrudes her anterior end and lays her eggs in clumps

rapid, and within 4-5 days the egg contains the infective L3. Eggs are
rubbed off and contaminate the environment. Infection is by ingestion of
embryonated eggs on fodder, grass, bedding etc. The larvae are released in
the small intestine, move into the large intestine and migrate into the
mucosal crypts of the caecum and colon where development to L4 takes
q  a o e    ti   ol u d
maturing to adult stages that inhabit the lumen and feed on intestinal
contents. The prepatent period of O. equi is 5 months. Longevity of
female worms is around 6 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Most of the pathogenic effects of O. equi in the intestine
are due to the feeding habits of the L4, which result in small erosions of
the mucosa and, in heavy infections, these may be widespread and
effect is the perineal irritation and anal pruritis caused by the adult females
during egg-laying. The resultant dull hair coat and loss of hair is known as
'rat-tail'.
Clinical signs: The presence of parasites in the intestine rarely causes any
clinical signs. However, intense pruritis around the anus causes the animal
to rub on available solid objects, resulting in broken hairs, bare patches
and inflammation and scaling of the skin over the rump and tail head. The
intense itching often leads to restlessness and impaired feeding, causing
some loss of condition.

Fig. 4.23 Adult Oxyuris equi worms in faeces.
702
Pathology: Small erosions may occur in the mucosa in heavy infections
Epidemiology: Although the infective stage may be reached on the skin,
more often flakes of material containing eggs are dispersed in the
environment by the animal rubbing on stable fittings, fencing posts or
other solid objects. Heavy burdens may build up in horses in infected
Stables and there appears to be little immunity to reinfection.
Treatment: O. equi is susceptible to many broad-spectrum anthelmintics
and should be controlled by routine chemotherapy for the more important
horse parasites. Effective anthelmintics include ivermectin, moxidectin,
the benzimidazoles (fenbendazole, oxfendazole, oxibendazole) and
pyrantel. Newly acquired horses should be treated routinely.
Where animals are showing clinical signs, the perineal skin and underside
of the tail should be frequently cleaned (about every 4 days) using a
disposable cloth to remove the egg masses prior to their development to
L3 larvae, in addition to anthelmintic treatment.
Control: A high standard of stable hygiene should be observed, such as
the frequent removal of bedding and the provision of feeding racks and
water troughs than cannot easily be contaminated by bedding.

Intestinalfiukes
Several species of intestinal flukes belonging to the genera Gastrodiscus
and Pseudodiscus are found in the large intestine of horses. Intermediate
hosts are snails.
Life cycle: The life cycle of the different species is generally similar
miracidia into water where they enter a species of water snail.
Development in the snail proceeds through sporocyst and rediae stages
leading to the release of cercariae, which encyst to form metacercariae.
Infection of the final host is by ingestion of metacercariae with herbage.
Excystation occurs in the intestine where the immature paramphistomes
develop to reach maturity.
Pathogenicity: Adult flukes cause little damage to the intestine. Disease
is usually caused by large numbers of immature flukes.
Clinical signs: Mild infections are subclinical. Heavy infections are
accompanied by diarrhoea, anaemia, oedema, emaciation and marked
weakness.

haemorrhage and necrosis. In heavy infections, there may be catarrhal and
haemorrhagic enteritis.
Epidemiology: Infection is acquired by ingesting the intermediate hosts
with vegetation.
Treatment: Flukicidal drugs, such as nitroxynil, oxyclozanide, closantel,
triclabendazole or albendazole and netobimin, are active against the adult
flukes; triclabendazole at 10 mg/kg or clasantel at 7 mg/kg are active
against immature flukes.
Control: Wet pastures or swamps where the intermediate hosts are found
should be avoided.

Hosts: Horse, donkey, occasionally humans
Life cycle: The female fly produces 700 to 800 larvae which are expelled
in batches of up to 40 into the nostrils of the hosts. First-stage larvae
remain in the nasal cavities, before moving to the pharyngeal area, where
development varies considerably depending on location. Third-stage larva
are expelled and pupate in the ground.
Geographical distribution: Russia, Ukraine, central Asia
Pathogenesis: This species is a serious veterinary problem in areas such
as Russia, and infestation by large numbers of larvae in the throat may
result in a high level of mortality.
708
Clinical signs: Nasal discharge, rubbing, sneezing, unthriftiness, circling
and lack of co-ordination. Secondary bacterial infections are common.
Diagnosis: Larvae may be observed in the nasal cavities, throat and base
of the tongue.
Pathology: Catarrh, infiltration of inflammatory cells and squamous
metaplasia, characterised by conversion of secretory epithelium  to
to infestation may be recorded.
Epidemiology: Adults are on the wing in midsummer. Usually only one
generation per year occurs, although a second may be observed in some
areas.
Treatment: Where the numbers of larvae are small, it may not be
economically viable to treat. However, in heavy infections closantel,
nitroxynil, and the endectocides ivermectin, doramectin and moxidectin
are highly effective, as are the organophosphates trichlorfon and
dichlorvos.
Control: Area-wide control may be impractical; herd treatment may be
given twice a year, the first at the beginning of summer to kill newly
acquired larvae, and the second in midwinter to kill any overwintering
larvae.
Dictyocaulus arnfieldi
Common name: Equine lungworm
Predilection site: Lungs
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are slender, thread-like and whitish; the
adult males measuring around 3.5 cm and the females 6.5 cm in length.
Their location in the trachea and bronchi and their size are diagnostic.
Description, microscopic: Male worms have a small non-lobulated bursa
with short rays, with the mediolateral and posteriolateral rays fused for
half their length. The spicules are short, equal length and slightly curved.

290-480 μm with a posterior protuberance (Fig. 4.24).
Fig. 4.24 Dictyocaulus arnfieidi first-stage larva showing the terminal
protuberance.
Hosts: Donkey, other equids and occasionally the horse
Life cycle: The detailed life cycle is not fully known, but is considered to
be similar to that of the bovine lungworm, D. viviparus, except in the
following respects. The adult worms are most often found in the small
bronchi and their thin-shelled eggs, containing the first-stage larvae, are
coughed up before they are swallowed, passed in the faeces and then hatch
soon after being deposited. The prepatent period is around 2-3 months.
Patent infections are common in donkeys of all ages, but in horses
generally only occur in foals and yearlings. In older horses the adult
lungworms rarely attain sexual maturity.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The characteristic lesion is similar in both horses and
donkeys and is somewhat different from bovine parasitic bronchitis.
Clinical signs: Despite the prevalence of patent D. arnfieldi infection in
donkeys, overt clinical signs are rarely seen; however, on close

This absence of significant clinical abnormality may be partly a reflection
Infection is much less prevalent in horses. However, patent infections may
develop in foals and these are not usually associated with clinical signs. In
older horses, infections rarely become patent but are often associated with

recovered from fresh faeces. In horses, although a history of donkey

circumscribed areas of over-inflated pulmonary tissue 3.0-5.0 cm in
diameter. On section, at the centre of each lesion is a small bronchus
containing lungworms and mucopurulent exudate. Microscopically, the

often surrounded by inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes.
Epidemiology: Donkeys acquire infection as foals and yearlings and tend
to remain infected, presumably through re-exposure, all their lives. Horses

donkeys are grazed as companion animals with horses. However, natural
infection in horses can occur in the absence of donkeys. In horses, the
prevalence of D. arnfieldi is difficult to establish since infections only

Treatment: Successful treatment of both horses and donkeys has been
reported using ivermectin or some benzimidazoles, such as fenbendazole
and mebendazole.
Control: Ideally, horses and donkeys should not be grazed together, but if
they are, it is advisable to treat the donkeys, preferably in the spring, with
711
a suitable anthelmintic. A similar regimen should be practised in donkey
studs and visiting animals should be isolated in separate paddocks.

PARASITES OF THE LIVER
Fasciola hepatica
Common name: Liver fluke
Predilection site: Liver
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Fasciolidae
For more details see Chapter 3 (Sheep and goats).
Echinococcus granulosus
Subspecies: equinus
Common name: Dwarf dog tapeworm, hydatidosis
Predilection site: Mainly liver and lungs (intermediate hosts); small
intestine (definitive host)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: Hydatid cysts are large fluid-filled vesicles, 5-10 cm
in diameter, with a thick concentrically laminated cuticle and an internal
germinal layer.
Description, microscopic: The germinal layer produces numerous small
vesicles or brood capsules, each containing up to 40 scolices, invaginated
into their neck portions and attached to the wall by stalks. Brood capsules
712
may become detached from the wall of the vesicle and float freely in the
vesicular fluid and form *hydatid sand'.
Final host: Dog, fox
Intermediate hosts: Horse, donkey
Geographical distribution: Mainly Europe
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Infection in horses is generally not
associated with clinical signs.
Epidemiology: Equine hydatidosis is commonest in Europe, and in other
horses. The strain is highly specific for the horse and the eggs do not
develop in the sheep. The domestic dog and the red fox are the final hosts,
and the cycle in countries of high prevalence depends on access by dogs to
infected equine viscera. On mainland Europe, the most likely source is
offal from horse abattoirs and in Britain the viscera of hunting horses,
which are fed to foxhounds. The horse strain does not appear to be
infective to man.
Treatment: No treatment in horses.
Control: This is based on the regular treatment of dogs to eliminate the
adult tapeworms and on the prevention of infection in dogs by exclusion
from their diet of animal material containing hydatids. This is achieved by
denying dogs access to abattoirs, and, where possible, by proper disposal
of equine viscera. In some countries these measures have been supported
by legislation, with penalties when they are disregarded.
Notes: There are two major strains of E. granulosus in domestic animals.
namely E. granulosus equinus, which is not infective to man, and E.

descriptions of individual species of trypanosomes and their control.
Trypanosoma bruceibrucei
Subgenus: Trypanozoon
Common name: Nagana
Predilection site: Blood. T. brucei bucei is also found extravascularly in.
for example, the myocardium, central nervous sytem (CNS) and
reproductive tract.
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: T. brucei brucei is pleomorphic in form and ranges from
long and slender up to 42 μm (mean 29 μm), to short and stumpy, 12-26
μm (mean 18 μm), the two forms often being present in the same blood
sample. The undulating membrane is conspicuous, the kinetoplast is small
and sub-terminal and the posterior end is pointed. In the slender form the
kinetoplast is up to 4 μm from the posterior end, which is usually drawn
out tapering almost to a point, and has a well-developed free flagellum. In
the stumpy form the flagellum is either short or absent and the posterior
end is broad and rounded with the kinetoplast almost terminal.
Intermediate forms average 23 μm long and have a blunt posterior end and
moderately long flagellum. A fourth form with a posterior nucleus may be

Hosts: Cattle, horse, donkey, zebu, sheep, goat, camel, pig, dog, cat, wild

Life cycle: Tsetse flies ingest trypanosomes in the blood or lymph while
feeding on an infected host. Thereafter the trypanosomes lose their
glycoprotein surface coat, and become elongated and multiply in the
trypomastigote, form and acquire an epimastigote form, characterised by
the fact that the kinetoplast lies just in front of the nucleus. After further
multiplication of the epimastigotes they transform again into small,
typically trypomastigote forms with a glycoprotein surface coat. These are
the infective forms for the next host and are called metacyclic
trypanosomes. The entire process takes at least 2-3 weeks and the
metacyclic trypanosomes are inoculated into the new host when the tsetse
fly feeds
typical blood forms, producing a raised cutaneous inflammatory swelling
called a chancre within a few days. Thereafter they enter the bloodstream,
multiply, and a parasitaemia, detectable in the peripheral blood, usually
becomes apparent 1-3 weeks later. Subsequently, the parasitaemia may
persist for many months although its level may wax and wane due to the
immune response of the host.

Life cycle: Transmission is by biting flies, no cyclical development
occurring in the vector, and the trypanosomes remaining in the proboscis.
Geographical distribution: North Africa, Central and South America,
central and southern Russia, parts of Asia (India, Burma, Malaysia,
southern China, [ndonesia, Phillipines)
719
Pathogenesis: Depending on the virulence of the strain and the
susceptibility of the individual host, the disease may be acute in horses,
camels and dogs. Other domestic species, such as cattle, buffalo and pigs,
are commonly infected, but overt disease is uncommon and their main
significance is as reservoirs of infection. The syndrome is similar to that
caused by the tsetsetransmitted trypanosomes. Anaemia is caused mainly
mononuclear phagocytic systems of the spleen, liver, and lungs; as the
disease becomes chronic there may be decreased haemoglobin synthesis.
Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are caused by mechanisms that
predispose leucocytes and platelets to phagocytosis.  Immunological
mechanisms in the pathogenesis lead to extensive proliferation of
activated macrophages, which engulf or destroy erythrocytes, leucocytes,
platelets and haematopoietic cells.
Clinical signs: All domestic animals are susceptible but the disease is
pyrexia, progressive anaemia, loss of condition and depression. Recurrent
episodes of fever occur during the course of disease. Oedematous
swellings, ranging from cutaneous plaques to frank oedema of the ventral
abdomen and genitalia and  petechial haemorrhages of  the serous
membranes are often observed. Abortions have been reported in buffaloes
in Asia. Nervous signs may occur and include circling, incoordination,
staggering, head pressing, paraplegia, paralysis and prostration.
Diagnosis: The clinical signs of the disease, although indicative, are not

parasitaemia is massive it is possible to detect motile trypanosomes in
fresh films of blood. More usually, both thick and thin smears of blood are
air dried and examined later. Thick smears, de-haemoglobinised before
staining with Giemsa or Leishman's stain, offer a better chance of finding
trypanosomes, while the stained thin smears are used for differentiation of
the trypanosome species.
More sensitive techniques utilise centrifugation in a microhaematocrit
tube followed by microscopic examination of the interface between the

Pathology: The carcase is often pale, emaciated and there may be
oedematous swellings in the lower part of the abdomen and genital organs
with serous atrophy of fat. The liver, lymph nodes and spleen are enlarged
and the viscera are congested. Petechiae may appear on lymph nodes,

orchitis, interstitial pneumonia and bone marrow atrophy. Splenic and
lymph node hypertrophy occur during the acute phase but the lymphoid
tissues are usually exhausted and fibrotic in the chronic stage.
Epidemiology: This species, although closely related to the salivarian
trypanosome T. brucei brucei, is mechanically transmitted by biting
insects; the usual vectors are horseflies (Tabanus) but Stomoxys,
Haematopota and Lyperosia can also transmit the infection. In Central and

Treatment and control: Suramin or quinapyramine (Trypacide) are the
drugs of choice for treatment and also confer a short period of
prophylaxis. For more prolonged protection a modified quinapyramine
known as “Trypacide Pro-Salt” is also available. Unfortunately, drug
resistance, at least to suramin, is not uncommon.

Notes: The original distribution of this parasite coincided with that of the
camel, and is often associated with arid desserts and semiarid steppes.
Trypanosoma congolensecongolense
Subgenus: Nannomonas
Common name: Nagana, paranagana, Gambia fever, ghindi, gobial
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: T. congofense is small, monomorphic in form, 8-20 μm
long. The undulating membrane is inconspicuous, the medium-sized
kinetoplast is marginal and the posterior end is blunt. There is no free
flagellum. In fresh blood films the organism moves sluggishly, often
apparently attached to red cells.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, horse, camel, dog, pig. Reservoir hosts include
antelope, giraffe, zebra, elephant and warthog.
Distribution: Sub-Saharan Africa
Pathogenesis: The signs caused by this species are similar to those caused
by other trypanosomes, but the CNS is not affected. Anaemia is caused
mononuclear phagocytic systems of the spleen, liver, and lungs but as the
disease becomes chronic there may be decreased haemoglobin synthesis.
Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are caused by mechanisms that
activated macrophages, which engulf or destroy erythrocytes, leucocytes,
platelets and haematopoietic cells.
Clinical signs: Symptoms include intermittent fever, anaemia, oedema of
the limbs and dependent parts, progressive weakness and loss of
condition.

BABESOSS/THEILERIOSS
Two species, the small Theileria equi (formerly Babesia equi) and the
large B. caballi, are of importance in horses.
Babesia caballi
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
Description:
Trophozoites
 within erythrocytes are
pear-shaped,
measuring 2-5 μm in length, commonly occurring in pairs joined at the
posterior ends with the angle between the organisms acute. Round or oval
forms 1.5-3 μm in diameter may also occur.
Hosts: Horse, donkey
Geographical distribution: Europe, Asia, Africa, South and Central
America, Southern USA, Australia: related to distribution of ticks.
Pathogenesis: Death, if it occurs, is due to organ failure which, in turn, is
due not only to destruction of the erythrocytes with resultant anaemia,
oedema and icterus, but also to the clogging of the capillaries of various
organs by parasitised cells and free parasites. The stasis from this sludging
723
causes degeneration of the endothelial cells of the small blood vessels.
anoxia, and accumulation of toxic metabolic products, capillary fragility
and eventual  perivascular escape of  erythrocytes and macroscopic
haemorrhage. The incubation period is 6-10 days.
Clinical signs: The disease may be chronic or acute, and in either case can
be mild or fatal. Haemoglobinuria is rare, but fever, anaemia and icterus
are present. Gastroenteritis is common. Locomotor signs are usually
present, and posterior paralysis may occur.
Diagnosis: Examination of blood films, stained with Romanowsky stains
such as Giemsa, will reveal the parasites in the red cells. Species
identification is essential with regard to choice of therapeutic drugs. The
paired merozoites joined at their posterior ends are considered to be a
diagnostic feature of B. caballi. Examinations should be made as early as
 t    m  ss  s s
after the5th day.
The complement fixation test (CFT) is the primary screening test used for
horses travelling between countries. Because the CFT may not identify all
infected animals, especially those that have been treated, and because of
anti-complementary reactions produced by some sera, the IFAT is used as
a supplementary test. Test sera are inactivated for 30 minutes at 60°C and
tested in dilutions of 1:5 to 1:5120. A lysis of 50% is recorded as positive.
with the titre being the greatest serum dilution giving 50% lysis. A titre of
1:5 is regarded as positive. Anti-complementary samples are examined by
the [FAT.
strong positive reaction is relatively simple, but any differentiation
between weak positive and negative reactions requires considerable
antigen of B. caballi. Test, positive and negative control sera are diluted
from 1/80 to 1/1280. Sera diluted 1/80 or more that show a strong
fluorescence are usually considered to be positive, although due
consideration is also given to the patterns of fluorescence of the positive
and negative controls.
Pathology: Principal lesions include splenomegaly with soft, dark red
splenic pulp and prominent splenic corpuscles. The liver is enlarged and
yellowish brown and the gallbladder is distended with thick, dark bile.
724
The mucosa of the intestine is oedematous and icteric with patches of
haemorrhage. Subcutaneous, subserous and intramuscular connective
tissues are oedematous and icteric. The blood is thin and watery, and the
plasma tinged with red.
Epidemiology: B. caballi is transmitted by a variety of tick species,
including Dermacentor, Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus. Tick vectors
include Dermacentor reticulatus,D.variabilis,D.albipictus,D. silvarum,
D.nitens,Hyalomma excavatum,H.scupense,Rhipicephalus bursa,R

months to 4 years.

Supportive treatment is essential in the treatment of acute disease and may
include blood transfusion, fluid therapy, vitamins and good nutrition. The
chemotherapy of babesiosis in horses is difficult and, due to the toxicity of
most effective drugs, care must be taken in the administration of the
correct dosage.

Control: Immunity in horses after infection lasts for more than 1 year and
horses are therefore protectedin enzootic areas even with the seasonal
fluctuation of the tick population. Tick control is essential. Special
attention should be paid to the ears, region under the tail and between the
hind legs. Horses introduced into endemic areas are very susceptible and
should therefore receive special attention.

Hosts: Horse, donkey
Geographical distribution: North, Central, South America, Africa, Asia,

Pathogenesis: Death, if it occurs, is due to organ failure which, in turn, is
due not only to destruction of the erythrocytes with resultant anaemia,
oedema and icterus, but also to the clogging of the capillaries of various
organs by parasitised cells and free parasites. The stasis from this sludging
causes degeneration of the endothelial cells of the small blood vessels,
anoxia, and accumulation of toxic metabolic products, capillary fragility
and eventual perivascular escape of erythrocytes and macroscopic
haemorrhage.
Clinical signs: The incubation period following an infective tick bite is
10-21 days. The first sign of disease is a rise in temperature followed by
listlessness, depression, marked thirst, inappetence, lachrymation and
blepharitis. The most characteristic sign is icterus. There is marked
anaemia and more than half the erythrocytes are often destroyed leading to
haemoglobinuria. Oedema of the head, legs and ventral part of the body is
sometimes present, although posterior paralysis, sometimes seen in B.
caballi infection, is absent. Affected animals are constipated, and pass
small, hard balls of faeces covered with yellow mucus. The animals lose
condition fairly rapidly, and may become extremely emaciated.
Haemorrhages are present on the mucosa of the nasal passages, vagina and
third eyelid. The disease lasts 7-12 days but may be peracute with death

usually about 10% but may reach 50%. Recovery is slow.
Diagnosis: Examination of blood films, stained with Romanowsky stains
such as Giemsa, will reveal the parasites in the red cells. Species
identification is essential with regard to choice of therapeutic drugs. The
terad or Maltese cross arrangement is a diagnostic feature of T. equi.
Examinations should be made as early as possible since the parasites
begin to disappear from the peripheral blood after the 5th day.
727
The complement fixation test (CFT) is the primary screening test used for
horses travelling between countries. Because the CFT may not identify all
infected animals, especially those that have been treated, and because of
anti-complementary reactions produced by some sera, the [FAT is used as
a supplementary test. Test sera are inactivated for 30 minutes at 60°C and
tested in dilutions of 1:5 to 1:5120. A lysis of 50% is recorded as positive,
with the titre being the greatest serum dilution giving 50% lysis. A titre of
1:5 is regarded as positive. Anti-complementary samples are examined by
the IFAT.
With the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) the recognition of a
strong positive reaction is relatively simple, but any differentiation
between weak positive and negative reactions requires considerable
experience in interpretation. Each sample of serum is tested against an
antigen of T. equi. Test, positive and negative control sera are diluted from
1/80 to 1/1280. Sera diluted 1/80 or more that show a strong fluorescence
are usually considered to be positive, although due consideration is also
given to the patterns of fluorescence of the positive and negative controls.
Pathology: Emaciation, icterus, anaemia and oedema are seen at
postmortem examination. There are accumulations of fluid in the
pericardial sac and body cavities, and the fat is gelatinous and yellow. The
spleen is enlarged, with soft, dark brown pulp. The lymph nodes are
swollen and sometimes inflamed. The liver is swollen, engorged and
brownish yellow, the hepatic lobules are yellow in the centre and greenish
yellow round the edges. The kidneys are pale yellow and may contain
petechial haemorrhages. There are petechial or ecchymotic heamorrhages
on the mucosa of the intestine and stomach
Epidemiology: T. equi is transmitted by a variety of tick species including
Dermacentor, Hyaiomma and Rhipicephaius. Vectors are Dermacentor
reticulatus, D. aibipictus, Hyalomma marginatum (syn. H. dendritum), H.
scupense, Rhipencephalus bursa in Russia and former Soviet states; R.
evertsi in equitorial Africa; H. anatolicum and H. marginatum in Greece
H. dromedarii and R. sanguineus in central Asia. The vectors in the USA
include D. variabilis, D. albipictus, D. (Anocentor) nitens and R.
sanguineus; in South America D. (A.) nitens.

Neorickettsia risticii
Synonym:Ehrlichiaristicii
Common name: Equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, Potomac horse fever,
ditch fever, Shasta River crud, equine ehrlichial colitis
Predilection site: Reproductive tract
729
Parasite class: Rickettsiales
Family: Rickettsiaceae
Description: N. risticii is a Gram-negative obligate intracellular
bacterium, 0.6-1.5 μm in size, with a trophism for monocytes. The
organism is not visible in monocytes in blood films from clinical cases.
Hosts: Horse, rarely dog, cat
Life cycle: Details of the life cycle are incomplete but infection to horses
appears to involve ingestion of metacercarial stages of trematodes or
inadvertent ingestion of aquatic insect stages.
Geographical distribution: USA
Pathogenesis: Potomac horse fever (PHF) is an acute enterocolitis
syndrome producing mild colic, fever, and diarrhoea in horses of all ages,
as well as abortion in pregnant mares.
Following ingestion within the insect or trematode, the organism is taken
up by cells of the monocyte/macrophage series and the organisms
accumulate in the reticuloendothelial cells in the wall of the large colon.
The infection of enterocytes of the small and large intestine results in
acute colitis, which is one of the principal clinical signs. Other signs vary
from transient mild fever to severe diarrhoea, which become apparent
after 12-18 days. Colic of variable severity and abdominal distension may
precede the onset of diarrhoea in about 25% of cases. As well as blood
and lymphoid tissue, the organisms have been detected in macrophages.

be present and affected horses may also exhibit mild to moderate
following the onset of diarrhoea. Infection has also been associated with
abortion in mares.
Clinical signs: Fever, depression, leucopenia, dehydration, laminitis and
diarrhoea
Diagnosis: A provisional diagnosis is often based on the presence of
typical clinical signs and the seasonal and geographic occurrence of the
730
disease. Examination of peripheral blood smears is of no value as infected
monocytes are present in small numbers in the blood. A definitive
blood or faeces of infected horses. Although serological tests such as
IFAT or ELISA exist, serological testing is of limited value as a
diagnostic tool, although many infected horses have high antibody titres at
the time of infection. Because of the high prevalence of false-positive
horses is difficult. Isolation of the agent in cell culture, although possible.
is time consuming and not routinely available in many diagnostic
laboratories. A recently developed real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) assay allows the detection of N. risticii DNA within 2 hours
making this a much more feasible test for routine diagnostic examination.
To enhance the chances of detection of N. risticii, the assay should be
performed on a blood as well as a faecal sample, as the presence of the
Organism in blood and faeces may not necessarily coincide.
Pathology: On postmortem, there are little or no gross pathological
endothelial cells in the colon leading to small ulcerative lesions and
 goblet cells and dilation of intestinal crypts.
Epidemiology: Disease is seen in spring, summer and early autumn and is
associated with pastures bordering creeks or rivers. N. risticii has been
identified in freshwater snails and isolated from trematodes released from
the snails. DNA has been detected in 13 species of immature and adult
caddisflies (Trichoptera),  mayflies (Ephemeroptera),  damselflies
(Odonata, Zygoptera), dragonflies (Odonata, Anisoptera) and stoneflies
(Plecoptera). Transmission studies using N. risticii-infected caddisflies
have reproduced the clinical disease. One route of exposure is believed to
be inadvertent ingestion of aquatic insects that carry N. risticii in the
Clinically ill horses are not contagious and can be housed with susceptible
horses.
Treatment: Oxytetracycline administered at a dose of 6.6 mg/kg i.v. for 5
days is highly effective if given early in the clinical course of the disease.

indicated in animals exhibiting signs of enterocolitis. Laminitis, if it
develops, is usually severe and often refractory to treatment.
Control: Several inactivated, whole-cell vaccines based on the same
strain of N. risticii are commercially available, although they are only
marginally protective in the field. Reduction of snail numbers in rivers and
ditches may be attempted to lessen sources of infection.
Notes: The causative agent, formerly known as Ehrlichia risticii, has
relationships to other Ehrlichia groups.
Anaplasma phagocytophilum
Synonym: Ehrlichia equi
Common name: Equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Anaplasmataceae
one or more loose aggregates (morulae or inclusion bodies, 1.5-5 μm in
diameter) of blue-grey to dark blue coccoid, coccobacillary Oor
pleomorphic organisms within the cytoplasm of neutrophils.
Hosts: Sheep, cattle, dog, horse, deer, rodents
Life cycle: Obligate intracellular organisms infecting granulocytes.
predominantly neutrophils, appearing within the cytoplasm as
membrane-bound vacuoles. Multiplication is by binary fission, forming
large inclusion bodies (morulae). In untreated animals, the cytoplasmic
inclusions can be detected in circulating neutrophils for l-2 weeks.
Geographical distribution: USA, South America, Europe
Pathogenesis: Equine  granulocytic ehrlichiosis is an infectious,
non-contagious, seasonal disease. Severity of signs varies with age of the
animal and duration of the illness. Signs may be mild. Horses less than 1
year old may have a fever only. Horses 1-3 years old develop fever
732
depression, mild limb oedema and ataxia. Adults exhibit the characteristic
signs of fever, partial anorexia, depression, reluctance to move, limb
oedema, petechiation and jaundice. The fever, which is highest during the
first 1-3 days (39.5-40°C), persists for 6-12 days. Rarely, myocardial
     
infection can be exacerbated. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are few during
the first 48 hours and increase to 30-40% of circulating neutrophils at
days 3-5 of infection.
Clinical signs: Fever, depression, limb oedema, jaundice and ataxia
Diagnosis: Demonstration of the characteristic cytoplasmic inclusion
bodies in blood smears is diagnostic. PCR can detect A. phagocytophiium
DNA in unclotted blood or buffy coat smears. An IFAT can detect rising
antibody body titres to A. phagocytophilum.
Pathology: Gross petechiation, ecchymoses and oedema develop in the
subcutis and fascia. Vasculitis is regional, with the subcutis and fascia of
the legs predominantly affected.
Epidemiology: In endemic areas, the disease is seasonal occurring during
periods of peak tick activity. In the USA, transmission to horses is by the
tick Ixodes pacificus (the western black-legged tick).
Treatment: Oxytetracycline and tetracycline, at 7 mg/kg i.v., for 8 days,
has eliminated the infection. Horses with severe ataxia and oedema may
benefit from shortterm corticosteroid treatment (dexamethasone 20 mg for
2-3 days)
Control: Recovered horses are solidly immune for more than 2 years.
There is no vaccine.
Notes: The causal riskettsial agent was initially termed Ehrlichia equi, but
based on DNA sequence relationships, the organism is now referred to as
Anaplasmaphagocytophilum

PARASITES OF THE NERVOUS
SYSTEM
Thelazia lacrymalis
Common name: Equine eye worm
Predilection site: Eye, conjunctival sac and lachrymal duct
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Small thin yellowish white worms, 1.0-2.0 cm long.
Males are 8-12 mm and females 14-18 mm.
Description, microscopic: A mouth capsule is present and the cuticle has
prominent striations at the anterior end. In the male, the tail is blunt and
recurved with caudal alae.
Final hosts: Horse and other equids
Intermediate hosts: Muscid flies, particularly Musca, Fannia and
Morellia
Life cycle: The worms are viviparous. The L1 passed by the female worm
into the lachrymal secretion is ingested by the fly intermediate host as it
feeds. Development from L1 to L3 occurs in the ovarian follicles of the fly
in 15-30 days during the summer months. L3 migrate to the mouthparts of
the fly and are transferred to the final host when the fly feeds.
    n  s a   
 prepatent period is between about 3-6 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Europe, North and South America and parts
ofAsia
Pathogenesis: In many hosts, moderate eyeworm infection causes little
pathogenic disease. Lesions are caused by the serrated cuticle of the worm
and most damage results from movement by the active young adults,
causing lachrymation, followed by conjunctivitis. In heavy infections the
cornea may become cloudy and ulcerated. There is usually complete
734
recovery in about 2 months, although in some cases areas of corneal
opacity can persist. Infection may predispose the host to secondary
bacterial infection.
Clinical signs: Often infection can be inapparent but heavy infestations
can cause lachrymation, conjunctivitis and photophobia. Flies are usually
clustered around the eye because of the excessive secretion. In severe
cases the eyes may be swollen, with keratitis, corneal ulceration with a
purulent exudate.
  s  o o o    i
first-stage larvae.
Pathology: Invasion of the lachrymal gland and ducts may cause
inflammation and necrotic exudation leading to occlusion and reduced tear
production.  Mechanical  irritation  of the  conjunctiva produces
inflammation, whilst damage to the cornea leads to opacity, keratitis and
corneal ulceration.
Epidemiology: Theiazia facrymalis is very common in some areas and
infestation occurs seasonally, linked to periods of maximum fly activity.
 i i    s    e    
the young adult that is pathogenic a reservoir of infection may persist in
symptomless carrier animals. Only heavy infections cause symptoms.
Survival of larvae also occurs in the pupal stages of flies during the
winter.
Treatment: Fenbendazole at 10 mg/kg per os for 5 days is effective.
[vermectin given directly into the conjunctival sac may also have some
effect, but is not effective when given orally. Mechanical removal with
forceps following the application of an ocular local anaesthetic is also
useful. In cases of secondary bacterial infection the use of antibiotic eye
preparations may be indicated.
Control: Prevention is difficult because of the ubiquitous nature of the fly
vectors. Fly control measures aimed at protecting the face, such as
headbands, aids in the control of eyeworm infection.

Halicephalobus delitrix
Synonym: Micronema delatrix
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Rhabditoidea
Pathogenesis: This saprophagous, free-living nematode has been found in
the brain and in granulomatous tissues of the nares and maxilla of horses.
Toxoplasma gondii

Sarcocystis neurona
Common name: Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM)
Predilection site: Brain, spinal cord
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystiidae
Description: Meronts present in the cytoplasm of neural cells, leucocytes
and giant cells in the grey and white matter of the brain and spinal cord
        x  
Intermediate hosts: Horse
Final host: Opposum (Dideophis virginiana). Armadillos, skunks,
raccoons, sea otters, seals and domestic cats have all been implicated but
their significance is not known.
Life cycle: Details of the life cycle are not completely known. The North
American opossum is thought to be one definitive host with transmission
to horse via sporocysts in faeces. The life cycle may also involve
opposums scavenging on bird carcases containing an identical organism,
Sarcocystis falcatula, a parasite of several North American bird species. In
this respect, horses may be acting as an abnormal, aberrant host.
Geographical distribution: North, Central, South America
736
Pathogenesis: The organism causes wide-ranging neurological signs
associated with infection of any part of the CNS.
Clinical signs: Clinical signs include circling; cranial nerve signs of
muscle atrophy, facial paralysis; unilateral vestibular disease; cervical
spinal cord disease (wobbler syndrome); monoplegia with muscle atrophy;
gait abnormalities, pruritis; cauda equine syndrome.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on clinical signs; analysis of cerebrospinal
fluid, response to antiprotozoal therapy and negative response to
corticosteroid  therapy.  Postmortem   diagnosis  is  confirmed   by
demonstration of the organisms in CNS lesions. A Western blot test for S.
neurona antibody in CSF has been developed.
Pathology: There is focal discoloration, haemorrhage and malacia of CNS
tissue. On histopathology, the parasites are found in association with
mixed inflammatory cellular responses, and neuronal degeneration.
Meronts in various stages of maturation, or free merozoites, are commonly
seen within the cytoplasm of neurons or macrophages, neutrophils.
eosinophils, more rarely capillary endothelial cells and myelinated axons.
Epidemiology: The disease is sporadic, although multiple cases have been
reported on farms or racing establishments but there is no evidence of
horse-to-horse transmission. The disease occurs most frequently in young
adult breeding stock.
Treatment: The treatment of choice appears to be trimethoprim/
sulphadiazine at 15 mg/kg twice daily combined with 0.25 mg/kg
pyrimethamine daily in feed. This may be followed by intermittent
therapy with the same drugs at 20 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg respectively once
every 1-2 weeks.
Control: The source of the infection is probably opossum faeces so
measures to prevent feed contamination should be considered.

PARASITES OF THE
REPRODUCTIVE/UROGENITAL
SYSTEM
Trypanosoma equiperdum
Subgenus: Trypanozoon
Synonym: Trypanosoma brucei equiperdum
Common name: Dourine
Predilection site: Reproductive tract
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description:  The  organism  is  identical  to,  and structurally
indistinguishable in  appearance from  T. evansi.  The organism is
polymorphic, with slender, intermediate and stumpy forms. The mean
length varies considerably with typical forms 15-34 μm long (mean 24
μm). The undulating membrane is conspicuous and the kinetoplast small
and sub-terminal. Strains that lack a kinetoplast, visible with the light
by treatment with certain dyes, drugs or frozen storage.
Hosts: Horse, donkey
Life cycle: The trypanosome is transmitted at coitus. The organism
divides by longitudinal binary fission in various tissue fluids, particularly
in subcutaneous urticarial plaques and in the reproductive system.
Geographical distribution: Mediterranean basin, South Africa, Middle
East, South America
Pathogenesis: The disease is marked by stages of exacerbation, tolerance

constant feature. In longstanding cases, the external genitalia may be
fibrosed. The incubation period is 2-l2 weeks and the disease runs a
chronic course over 6 months to 2 years.
Clinical signs: The first sign is oedema of the genitalia and there is slight
fever, inappetance and a mucous discharge from the urethra and vagina.
Circumscribed areas of the mucosa of the vulva or penis may become
depigmented. The second stage of the disease is characterised by urticaria
and appears after 4-6 weeks. Circular, sharply circumscribed urticarial
plaques about 3 cm in diameter arise on the sides of the body, remain for
3-4 days, and then disappear. The plaques may develop again later.
Muscular paralysis develops beginning with the muscles of the nostrils
and neck, extending to the hind limbs and finally to the rest of the body.
The animal shows incoordination and then complete paralysis. Dourine is
usually fatal unless treated, but mild strains of the parasite may occur in
some regions.

results obtained by CFT.
Pathology: At postmortem examination, gelatinous exudates are present
under the skin. In the stallion, the scrotum, sheath and testicular tunica are
thickened and infiltrated. In some cases, the testes are fibrosed and may be
unrecognisable. In the mare, the vulva, vaginal mucosa, uterus, bladder
and mammary glands may be thickened with gelatinous infiltration. The
lymph nodes, particularly in the abdominal cavity, are hypertrophied,
softened and, in some cases, haemorrhagic. There is pronounced anaemia
and oedematous infiltration of the perineal tissues and ventral abdominal

trypanosomes are not continually present in the genital tract throughout
the course of the disease, transmission of the infection does not
Transmission of infection from mare to foal can occur via the mucosa
such as the conjunctiva. Mares' milk has been shown to be infectious. T.
Oedema on the genitals is not obvious and skin plaques only occur in less
than 10% of infected donkeys. Sperm and vaginal discharges contain large
numbers of parasites and are therefore a significant reservoir of the
pathogen.
Treatment: Quinapyramine sulphate (3-5 mg/kg s.c.) is one of the few
compounds effective against T. equiperdum. In many countries,
chemotherapy is prohibited and strict border controls are required before
importation ofhorses and donkeys.
Control: Strict control of breeding and movements of horses together
with quarantine and slaughter in clinical outbreaks has a marked effect on
the incidence of disease. Detection and slaughter of carrier equines leads
to eventual eradication. In-contact animals are declared free after 3
consecutive monthly negative complement fixation tests.
Notes: T. equiperdum causes the most important venereal disease in
horses and is responsible for great losses wherever it occurs.

Klossiella equi
Predilection site: Kidney
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
740
Family: Klossiellidae
Description: Meronts in endothelial cells of Bowman's capsule in the
kidneys are 8-12 μm in diameter with 20-30 nuclei. Second-generation
meronts found in epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubules are
15-23 μm in diameter containing 15-20 merozoites. Gamogony and
sporogony occur in the epithelial cells of the thick limb of Henle's loop.
The microgamonts form 4-10 microgametes. Sporonts, 20-23 μm in
fission, forming 1o-l5 or more nuclei, which condense and come to lie
sporozoites and are themselves contained in a sac formed, by the host cell.
Hosts: Horse, donkey, zebra
Life cycle: The life cycle is not clearly understood. Within epithelial cells
of kidney tubules, trophozoites form meronts and merozoites, which in
turn form gamonts. Fertilised gametes are believed to develop into
sporonts, which bud to form sporoblasts. Each of these sporoblasts
undergoes successive divisions to  form sporocysts  that contain
sporozoites. Mature sporocysts are surrounded by a thick wall and pass
from the body in the urine. When ingested by another host, the sporozoites
are released from the sporocyst, move to the kidney, where they enter
epithelial cells and initiate the cycle.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Non-pathogenic and not usually
associated with clinical signs
Diagnosis: Sporocysts may be detected in urine sediments or trophozoite
stages may be found on postmortem in the kidney. The site and location
are pathognomonic.
Pathology: Only heavily parasitised kidneys have gross lesions, which
are areas of necrosis, with perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells,
s
Epidemiology: Sporocysts are passed in the urine and infection takes
place by the ingestion of the sporulated sporocysts.

Treatment and control: Not required
Notes: This species is apparently quite common throughout the world but
seldom seen.

Epidemiology: Little is known of the epidemiology, but from the high
prevalence of symptomless infections observed in abattoirs it is clear that
 e   s e     a so 
transmission is likely. Acute outbreaks are probably most likely when
horses, which have been reared without dog contact, are subsequently
exposed to large numbers of the sporocysts from dog faeces. The
longevity of the sporocysts shed in the faeces is not known.
Treatment: There is no effective treatment for Sarcocystis infection in
horses.
Control: The only control measures possible are those of simple hygiene.
Farm dogs should not be housed in, or allowed access to, fodder stores.
nor should they be allowed to defecate in pens where horses are housed. It
is also important that they are not fed uncooked meat.

Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: Slender whitish worms; males are 15-20 cm and
females over 50 cm long
Description, microscopic: Microfilariae are 330-370 μm and possess a
long whiplash tail.
Final hosts: Horse, donkey
Intermediate hosts: Culicoides spp (biting midges)

rather than in the peripheral bloodstream. They migrate in subdermal
connective tissue in the ventral midline; biting midges, feeding in this
area, ingest microfilariae, which then develop to the infective stage in
around 3 weeks. When these infected midges feed on another equine host
transmission of L3 occurs. The prepatent period is around 12-l6 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The connective tissue of the flexor tendons and suspensory
ligament of the fetlocks is the preferential site. Following inoculation of
L3 by the vector, Cuficoides, the arrival of the parasites in their final site

examined for the presence of microfilariae.
Pathology: The ventral skin lesions are indistinguishable from those of
Culicoides sensitivity. Gross lesions include alopecia, scaling, crusting
and leucoderma. Secondary excoriations and ulcerative dermatitis are
induced by self-trauma.
Epidemiology: The general prevalence of equine onchocercosis is high.
most surveys in the USA having shown rates of more than 50%, though
the highest so far recorded in Britain is 23%. The accumulation of
microfilariae in the definitive host is highest during the seasons of greatest
midge activity.
Treatment: Not usually required. Ivermectin has good activity against the
microfilariae stages and will provide relief in cases of onchocercal
dermatitis.
Control: Generally not indicated. Insecticidal sprays or repellents may
reduce attacks by biting midges.
Notes: Though onchocercosis is an important filarial infection in human
medicine, most species in domestic animals are relatively harmless

harness areas may make the animals unsuitable for work.
Clinical signs: Clinically the condition is characterised by matting of the
hair due to blood and tissue fluid exudates from ruptured nodules. The
animals are hot, so that they appear to be 'sweating blood'. Occasionally,
lesions are mistaken for injuries caused by thorns and barbed wire.

Diagnosis: The presence of nodules in the skin (*bleeding points') are
pathognomonic. Larvated eggs or microfilariae can be demonstrated by
microscopic examination of smears taken from the haemorrhagic exudate
of fresh lesions. An ELISA is also available in some countries for
serodiagnosis.
Pathology: Nodules formed in the cutaneous and intermuscular
connective tissue are 1-2 cm in diameter, enlarge in the summer months,
burst open and haemorrhage and heal by scarring.
Epidemiology: Disease is usually only apparent in the warmer seasons in
temperate regions, whereas in hot tropical areas lesions are often seen
after the rainy season. Although the condition tends to disappear in cold
weather it will periodically reappear during warmer months for up to 4
years in individual animals.
Treatment: This is difficult, but oral ivermectin or moxidectin may be
tried.
Control: Fly control measures will be beneficial.

Setaria equina
Common name: Abdominal worm
Predilection site: Peritoneum, pleural cavity
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: The adults are long and slender, reaching 8 cm
(males) and 13 cm (females). The posterior end is spirally coiled
Description, microscopic: The microfilariae present in the blood are
about 0.25 mm long.
Final hosts: Horse, donkey
Intermediate host: Mosquitoes
Life cycle: Larvae produced by adult worms in the body cavity circulate
in the blood and are taken up by culicine mosquitoes, including Aedes and
weeks, and are re-injected into horses when the mosquitoes feed. The
prepatent period is 8-10 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The adult worms live in the abdominal body cavity.
Occasionally, the adults invade the lungs and eyes. The worms in their
normal site are usually harmless and are only discovered at necropsy.
Migrating larvae can cause an encephalomyelitis in horses and also can
invade the eye and induce blindness.
Clinical signs: There are no clinical signs when the worms are in their
normal site, but when nervous tissue is involved there is locomotor
disturbance and in severe cases lumbar paralysis.
Diagnosis: [nfection with the adult worms is only accidentally discovered
           
possible by microscopic examination of the spinal cord, since the parasites
exist only as larval forms in their aberrant site.
749
Pathology: Migrating larvae affecting the CNS may cause areas of
damage seen as brown foci or streaks grossly. The lesions show
microcavitation and variable haemorrhage. There is loss of myelin and
fragmentation of axons locally with eosinophils, neutrophils and
macrophages present along with a mild meningitis and vascular cuffing.
Epidemiology: Since the worms are usually innocuous their epidemiology
has received little study. The prevalence is higher in warmer countries,
where there is longer seasonal activity of the mosquito vectors.
Treatment: There is no treatment for setarial paralysis. Ivermectin has
been reported to be effective against adult S. equina.
Control: This would depend on control of the mosquito vectors, which is
unlikely to be applied specifically for this parasite.
Notes: The members of this genus are usually harmless inhabitants of the
 peritoneal and pleural cavities.

Bovicola equi
inba
Common name: Horse louse
Predilection site: Upper epidermal layers of the neck, flanks and tail base
750
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Ischnocera
Family: Trichodectidae
Description: These lice are up to 1-2 mm long and reddish brown in
colour. The relatively large head is as wide as the wingless body, and
rounded anteriorly. The mouthparts are ventral. This species has a
three-segmented antenna and a single claw on the tarsi.
Hosts: Horse
Life cycle: During a lifespan of about a month females lay one egg
approximately every day, glued singly on to a hair shaft. The eggs are
usually whitish and may be seen with the naked eye. Females avoid
ovipositing on the coarse hairs of the mane and tail, instead preferring
finer hairs on the side of the neck, the flanks and the tail base. [n severe

nymph that is similar in appearance to the adult, although the nymph is
much smaller, with lighter sclerotisation and less distinct banding. The
cycle from egg to adult takes 3-4 weeks.
The mouthparts of Bovicola equi are adapted for biting and chewing, and
allow them to feed on the outer layers of the hair shafts, dermal scales and
blood scabs. They also feed on the exudates resulting from their irritant
effect. Bovicola equi is capable of rapid population expansion.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Bovicola equi may cause intense irritation, resulting in
rubbing and scratching, with matting and loss of hair and sometimes
self-excoriation, involving almost the entire body in extreme cases. It is
possible  that heavy  louse infestations  in equines are  themselves
symptomatic of some other disorder, such as disease or, more likely,
simple neglect. If neglected and left ungroomed, the undisturbed louse
 population will multiply more rapidly. In addition animals in a debilitated

small pale eggs are readily found scattered throughout the coat. Other
symptoms include a rough coat, skin infections, loss of hair and weight

Diagnosis: The lice and their eggs may be seen within the hair and on the
skin when the coat is parted. The lice may be removed and identified
under a light microscope.
Pathology: The pathology of louse infestation is extremely variable.
Infestations may induce alopecia, dermal irritation, papulocrustous
dermatitis and selfexcoriation.
contaminated grooming equipment, blankets, rugs and saddlery. Severe
infestations spread over the entire body, and the numbers are greatest in
winter and early spring when the winter coat is at its most dense.
Longer-haired animals and breeds are more prone to infestation by this
species. As in cattle, the shedding of the winter coat is important in
ridding animals of the greater part of their louse burden in spring. In hot
countries the skin temperature of the animal's back may be high enough to
kill lice in the exposed, fine-coated areas.
Treatment: Currently pyrethroid-based insecticides, applied as
non-systemic, pour-on formulations are usually used to control lice, as
many older drugs are no longer available. All of the horses in the
establishment should be treated. Because eggs are relatively resistant to
hatched lice. Systemic treatments, such as the avermectins, are not
approved for treatment of lice on horses.
Control: Grooming equipment should be scalded, blankets and rugs
thoroughly washed, and saddlery thoroughly cleaned. Ideally, animals
should have individual grooming equipment, and saddlery should not be

Haematopinus asini
Common name: Horse sucking louse
Predilection site: Skin of head, neck, back, brisket and between the legs
Parasite class: [nsecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Anoplura
Family: Haematopinidae
Description: Haematopinus asini is 3-3.5 mm long and yellow-brown as
an adult. The lice have three pairs of legs and a long, narrow head with
piercing mouthparts adapted for sucking blood and tissue fluids. The lice
are found only on equines. All the species of Haematopinus are large lice.

tibial spur. Distinct sclerotised paratergal plates are visible on abdominal
segments 2 or 3 to 8.
Hosts: Horse, donkey
Life cycle: During a lifespan of about a month the female lays operculate
eggs ('nits') at a rate of one to six eggs per day. These are usually whitish,
and are glued to the hair where they may be seen with the naked eye. They
hatch in 1-2 weeks. Nymphs grow and moult over a period of about 12
days until the fully grown adult is present. After feeding and mating, the
days of oviposition, and an average of around 24 eggs are laid per female.
The whole cycle from egg to adult takes 3-4 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: On horses, Haematopinus asini is most commonly found
on the head, neck, back and inner surface of the upper legs. Symptoms
include heavy dandruff and greasy skin and eventually bald spots with
raw, red centres. Light infestations may be asymptomatic but, if present in

frequent blood meals. Each time they feed, they puncture the skin in a
different place. As in other animals, equine lice may cause intense
irritation, resulting in rubbing and scratching, with matting and loss of hair
and sometimes excoriation, involving almost the whole body in extreme
cases. Animals are restless and lose condition and, in heavy Haematopinus
infestations, there may also be anaemia. Loss of condition and weight may
increase the susceptibility of the host animal to other diseases.
Diagnosis: Restlessness, rubbing and damage to the coat would suggest
that lice are present, and when the hair is parted the parasites will be
found. These lice are large and yellow-brown, and very easily seen, and in
ofthecoat.
Pathology: The pathology of louse infestation is extremely variable. Low
infestations may induce alopecia, irritation, papulocrustous dermatitis and
self-excoriation. The blood-feeding of Haematopinus may cause anaemia.
Epidemiology: In normal light infestations, lice occupy sites in the dense
hair of the mane, the base of the tail, the submaxillary space, and also on
the fetlocks of rough-legged breeds. From these sites spread occurs over
the whole body, and the numbers are greatest in winter and early spring
when the winter coat is at its most dense. As in cattle, the shedding of the
winter coat is important to rid animals of the greater part of their louse
burden in spring. In hot conditions the skin temperature of the animal's

Demodex equi
Predilection site: Hair follicles and sebaceous glands
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Demodicidae
Description: Species of Demodex have an elongate tapering body, up to
0.1-0.4 mm in length, with four pairs of stumpy legs ending in small blunt
claws in the adult (Fig. 6.32). Setae are absent from the legs and body.
The legs are located at the front of the body, and, as such, the striated
opisthosoma forms at least half the body length.
Hosts: Horse
Life cycle: Demodex spp usually live as commensals in the skin, and are
highly site-specific, occupying the hair follicles and sebaceous glands.
Females lay 20-24 spindle-shaped eggs in the hair follicle that give rise to
hexapod larvae, in which each short leg ends in a single, three-pronged
claw. Unusually, a second hexapod larval stage follows, in which each leg
ends in a pair of three-pronged claws. Octopod protonymph, tritonymph
and adult stages then follow. Immature stages and these migrate more
concurrently. The life cycle is completed in 18-24 days. [n each follicle or
gland the mites may occur in large numbers, located in a characteristic

involve most of the body.
Epidemiology: Probably because of its location deep in the dermis, it is
difficult to transmit Demodex between animals unless there is prolonged
contact. Such contact occurs most commonly at suckling.
Treatment: There is little information regarding the treatment of equine
demodecosis. Investigation and treatment of underlying systemic disease
should be performed. Amitraz is contraindicated in horses because it can
cause severe colic and death.
Control: Not usually required.
Notes: A second species, D. cabaili, which infests the eyelids and muzzle
has been described in horses; whether this is a true species of a
morphological variant has not been established.
Sarcoptes scabiei
Common name: Scabies
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
756
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Sarcoptidae
Notes: This mange is now uncommon in horses. In Britain, for example,
only two cases have been recorded since 1948. In both cases there was
species.
Pathogenesis: When present sacrcoptic mange can be severe. There may
be intense pruritus due to hypersensitivity. Early lesions appear on the
head, neck and shoulders as small papules and vesicles that later develop
into crusts. Alopecia and crusting spread, become lichenified, forming
folds. If untreated, lesions may extend over the whole body, leading to
emaciation, general weakness and anorexia.
Treatment: If suspected, organophosphate insecticides or lime-sulphur
at 12- to 14-day intervals at least three to four times. Alternatively, the
oral administration of ivermectin or moxidectin at 200 μg/kg can be
attempted. Several treatments are required, 2-3 weeks apart, and it is
important to treat all contact animals.

Notes: The names Chorioptes ovis, Chorioptes equi, Chorioptes caprae
and Chorioptes cuniculi used to describe the chorioptic mites found on
sheep, horses, goats and rabbits respectively, are now all thought to be
synonyms of Chorioptes bovis.
In horses, chorioptic mange due to C. bovis is occasionally observed. The
mites are restricted to the pastern and occurs as crusty lesions with
thickened skin on the legs below the knees and hocks, and is most
prevalent in rough-legged animals and in those with heavy feather (Fig.
4.27). Though the mites are active only superficially, their movement
causes irritation and restlessness, especially at night when animals are

STOMACH
Hyostrongylus rubidus
Common name: Red stomach worm
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: Slender reddish worms when fresh, males measuring
 st     un  oo sy    p
transversely and longitudinally striated with 40-45 longitudinal striations.
Description, microscopic: A small cephalic vesicle is present and the
spicules resemble Ostertagia in ruminants, but have only two distal
branches. The bursa of the male is well developed and the dorsal lobe
small. There is a well developed telamen and short spicules. The vulva of
the female opens in the posterior third of the body. Eggs are medium
sized, 71-78 x 35-42 μm strongyle-type and are often difficult to
differentiate from those of Oesophagostomum.
Hosts: Pig, wild boar; occasionally found in rabbits
Life cycle: The free-living and parasitic stages are similar to those of
Ostertagia; infection is through oral ingestion of L3. The prepatent period
is about 3 weeks. Hypobiosis of L4 may occur following repeated
infection, or be induced by seasonal changes, and is often seen in older
animals. In sows these hypobiotic larvae may resume their development
during the periparturient relaxation of immunity and/or early lactation,
leading to an increase in the faecal egg count.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Similar to ostertagiosis, with penetration of the gastric
undifferentiated cells which proliferate to give rise to nodules on the
mucosal surface. The pH becomes elevated in heavy infections and there
is an increase in mucus production and a catarrhal gastritis. Sometimes
there is ulceration and haemorrhage of the nodular lesions, but more
766
commonly light infections occur and these are associated with decreased
appetite and poor feed conversion rates.
Clinical signs: Light infections are often asymptomatic. Heavy infections
can lead to inappetence, vomiting, anaemia, loss of condition and
bodyweight. Diarrhoea may or may not occur.
Diagnosis: This is based on a history of access to permanent pig pastures
and the clinical signs. Confirmatory diagnosis is by examination of faeces
for eggs; larval identification following faecal culture may be necessary,
particularly to differentiate Hyostrongylus from Oesophagostomum. At
the gastric mucosa. Other stomach worms, the spiruroid nematodes, are
larger: >13 mm.
Fig. 5.1 Hyostrongylus rubidus on the mucosa of an infected stomach.
Pathology: During the course of larval development there is dilation of
infected gastric glands and hyperplasia of the glandular epithelium of both
infected and neighbouring glands. The lamina propria is oedematous with
infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Larvae are
found in the gastric glands with adults mainly on the surface (Fig. 5.1).
During the course of development the hyperplasia causes the formation of
pale nodules, which may become confluent in heavy infections, leading to
the formation of a thickened, convoluted mucosa. There may be focal or
diffusely eroded areas and occasionally ulceration of the glandular
mucosa.
Epidemiology: Because of the preparasitic larval requirements, infection
767
therefore more common in breeding stock, particularly gilts. The
free-living larvae are particularly sensitive to desiccation and low
temperatures. The epidemiology, at least in temperate zones, is similar to
that of Ostertagia in ruminants with seasonal hypobiosis a feature. Adult
 pigs often act as a reservoir of infection.
Treatment: When Hyostrongy/us infection is diagnosed, particularly in
breeding stock, it is important to use a drug such as a modern
benzimidazole or a macrocyclic lactone, which will remove hypobiotic
larvae.
gastroenteritis in ruminants. For example, in temperate areas there should
be an annual rotation of pasture with other livestock or crops. The timing
of the move to other pastures may be dependent on other farming
activities; if it can be delayed until October or later and accompanied by
an anthelmintic treatment, then eggs from any worms which survive the
treatment are unlikely to develop due to the unfavourable winter
temperatures. A second treatment, again using a modern benzimidazole or
a macrocyclic lactone is recommended 3-4 weeks later to remove any
residual infection. It may be advantageous to treat pregnant pigs before
farrowing-
Notes: This parasite is responsible for a chronic gastritis in pigs,
particularly gilts and sows.
Ollulanus tricuspis
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: This is a very small trichostrongyle (0.7-1.0 mm
long). Males are 0.7-0.8 mm, and females 0.8-1 mm long.
coil of the head. The male bursa is well developed and the spicules are
stout and each is split into two for a considerable distance. The female has
the body and there is only one uterus and ovary.
768
Hosts: Cats, wild felids; occasionally found in pigs, foxes and domestic
dogs
Life cycle: The worms are viviparous, the larvae developing to the L3
stage in the uterus of the females. Autoinfection can occur, the shed L3
developing into adult worms on the gastric mucosa in around 45 weeks.
The whole life cycle may be completed endogenously and transmission, at
least in the cat, is thought to be via ingestion of vomit containing the L3.
The worms live under a layer of mucus in the stomach wall and the
anterior end of the worm is often located within the gastric crypts.
Geographical distribution: Mainly occurs in Europe, North and South
America, Australasia and the Middle East.
Pathogenesis: A chronic gastritis has been reported in the pig.
Clinical signs: Occasional vomiting and emaciation
Diagnosis: Diagnosis of ollulanosis is seldom made because of their small
size and lack of eggs and larvae in the faeces. Examination of vomit,
following an emetic, for the presence of worms is a useful approach. At
gastric mucosa should lead to a diagnosis
Pathology: The worms lie beneath the mucus on the surface of the
stomach, or partly in the gastric glands, and their presence may lead to
of the gastric glands causing the stomach mucosa to become convoluted
and thrown into folds.
Epidemiology: The parasite is common in some parts of the world.
particularly in cat colonies and cats that roam. The parasite can replicate
in the stomach without any need for external egg or larval phases and can
spread via vomit. The disease spreads mainly among starving stray cats
and from them to other hosts.

Ascarops strongylina
Synonym: Arduenna strongylina
Predilection site: Stomach

of the body. The wall of the pharynx contains several spiral supports. Eggs
are thick-shelled, 34-49 × 20 μm, and are embryonated when passed.
Final hosts: Pig, wild boar
Intermediate hosts: Coprophagous beetles (Aphodius, Onthophagus,
Gymnopieurus)
Life cycle: The life cycle of A. strongylina is typically spiruroid. Eggs
passed in the faeces of the infected host develop into infective larvae, if
ingest the beetles. The prepatent period is about 4 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: A. strongylina is not severely pathogenic; the main effect
being a catarrhal gastritis, particularly in young animals.
Clinical signs: Clinical signs are usually absent, although, in heavy
infections, softening of faeces and inappetence may occur.
examination, but the presence of the small elongate eggs in the faeces of
animals showing signs of gastritis will give a tentative indication of
spiruroidosis.
Pathology: On postmortem, the gastric mucosa is sometimes reddened
and oedematous.
770
Epidemiology: The epidemiology depends on  the presence and
abundance of the intermediate beetle hosts. Infection is more prevalent in
outdoor pigs at pasture.
Treatment: Treatment has not been considered with this genus.
Control: Not usually required.
Ascarops dentata
Synonym: Arduenna dentata
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Geographical distribution: Malaysia, S.E. Asia.
All other details are essentially similar to A. strongylina
Gnathostoma hispidum
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Thick-bodied worms; the males are 1.5-2.5 cm and
the females 2.0-4.5 cm long. The presence of the worms in gastric
nodules is sufficient for generic diagnosis.
Description, microscopic: The whole body is covered with spines. The
left spicule is longer than the right. Eggs are 0val, 72-74 × 39-42 μm with
a thin cap at one pole.
Final host: Pig, rarely man
Intermediate hosts: Cyciops spp and related freshwater crustacea
Life cycle: The young worms migrate in the abdominal organs of the host,
particularly the liver. Adult worms live in tunnels in the gastric nodules.
and the eggs pass from there into the lumen and are dropped into the water
771
in the faeces where they develop to L2 before hatching after several days
Crustaceans ingest L2 and development to L3 takes place within about 10
days. The final host is infected by ingestion of the crustacea and further
development occurs in the stomach wall, where the deeply embedded
worms provoke the growth of fibrous lesions. A second intermediate host
is not required with G. hispidum.
Geographical distribution: Europe, Asia, Africa
Pathogenesis: The most obvious effect of gnathostomosis is the presence
of fibrous growths on the stomach wall. Ulceration and necrosis of the
stomach wall are often present. In some cases a number of larvae will
migrate from the stomach to other organs, most commonly the liver, in
which they burrow, leaving necrotic tracks in the parenchyma. It occurs
erratically in man as a cause of visceral larva migrans.
Clinical signs: Gnathostoma infection is usually inapparent. Severe
infections may produce a marked gastritis leading to inappetence and
weight loss.
Diagnosis: The infection in the living animal can only be diagnosed by
the finding of the greenish, oval eggs, which have a thin cap at one pole,
in the faeces. Often, however, eggs are not present in faeces.
Pathology: Fibrous growths are of variable size, the largest being 3-4 cm
in diameter, and are cavitated, amounting to thick-walled cysts containing
several worms and fluid.
Epidemiology: It should be noted that the final hosts are also eligible
second intermediate hosts, so that, for example, the pig may harbour L3 in
its liver and muscles as well as adult worms in its stomach.
Treatment: Treatment has not been fully investigated
Control: With ubiquity of the first and second intermediate hosts,
thorough cooking of all food.
Gnathostoma doloresi

Physocephalus sexalatus
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Deseription, gross: Small, slender worms; the males measuring about
10-12 mm and the females up to 22 mm long.
Description, microscopic: The wall of the pharynx contains a single
spiral support. The cervical papillae are asymmetrically located. Eggs are
thick-shelled and are embryonated when passed.
Final hosts: Pig; occasionally rabbit, hare
Intermediate hosts: Coprophagous beetles
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically spiruroid and the prepatent period is
about 6 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Widely distributed in many parts of the
world
Pathogenesis: The parasites lie on the surface of the stomach wall under a
layer of mucus. P. sexalatus is not severely pathogenic, the main effect
being a catarrhal gastritis, particularly in young piglets.
Clinical signs: In many infections, obvious clinical signs are absent; in
heavy infections, softening of faeces and inappetance may occur.
Diagnosis: As for other spiruroid parasites

Epidemiology: Infection occurs where the intermediate hosts are
plentiful. Transmission may also occur through paratenic hosts, such as
amphibians or birds.
Treatment: Not reported
Control: Measures that restrict dung beetle populations feeding on pig
faeces will be beneficial.
Notes: P. sexalatus is not considered to be of great economic or
pathogenic importance.
Simondsia paradoxa
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Small slender worms. The females measure up to
about 20 mm in length, and males are 12-15 mm long.
Description, microscopic: Females have large lateral alae and a large
ventral and dorsal tooth. The gravid female has a characteristic form, the
posterior end of the body being a rounded sac filled with eggs. The male
has a spirally coiled tail. Eggs are oval or ellipsoid, 20-29 μm.
Final host: Pig
Intermediate hosts: Beetles
Life cycle: The life cycle is indirect. Eggs are passed in the faeces and
ingested by beetles in which they hatch and develop to infective larvae.
The parasites continue development  when the intermediate host is
ingested by a pig. Male worms live on the surface of the gastric mucosa,
but the females are found in small cysts in the mucosal crypts with their
anterior ends protruding.
Geographical distribution: Predominantly a parasite of tropical and
subtropical regions; also occurs in parts of Europe.

Pathogenesis: Simondsia paradoxa is not severely pathogenic, the main

reaction around the nodules in the stomach wall.
Clinical signs: Infections are usually asymptomatic.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis of a particular genus is difficult by faecal
examination, but the presence of the small elongate eggs in the faeces of
animals showing signs of gastritis will give a tentative indication of
spiruroidosis.
Pathology: Females are present in nodules 6-8 mm in diameter.
where the intermediate hosts are more abundant.
Treatment: Treatment is generally not considered.
Control: Attempts to control these spiruroids are unlikely to be successful
because of the ready availability of the intermediate hosts.
Trichostrongylus axei
Synonym: Trichostrongyius extenuatus
Common name: Stomach hairworm
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are small, hair-like, light brownish red and
difficult to see with the naked eye. Males measure around 3-6 mm and
females 4-8 mm in length.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, deer, horse, donkey, pig and occasionally man
Chapter 3 (Sheep and goats).
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
775
Pathogenesis: T. axei may occasionally be found in the stomach of pigs,
but is considered to be of minor importance.
SMALLINTESTINE
Globocephalusurosubulatus
Synonym: Giobocephalus longemucronatus
Common name: Pig hookworm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Strongyloidea
Description, gross: A very small, stout whitish worm, 0.4-0.8 cm long
Description, microscopic: The mouth opens subdorsally and the buccal
capsule is globular but with an absence of chitinous structures in the
buccal capsule. The male bursa is well developed and the spicules are
slender.
Hosts: Pig, wild boar
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct, either by oral ingestion of L3 larvae or
by percutaneous penetration. Larval migration through the heart, lungs,
trachea, oesophagus and stomach occurs.
Geographical distribution: North and South America, Europe, Africa
and Asia
Pathogenesis: Not known but thought to be generally of little pathological
significance, although heavy infections may affect piglets severely.
Clinical signs: Generally asymptomatic, although heavily infected piglets
may be anaemic and show weight loss and emaciation.
Diagnosis: Identification of eggs in the faeces, or adult worms found in
the small intestine on postmortem.
Pathology: Not described
776
Epidemiology: Not reported
Treatment: Most modern benzimidazoles and macro- cyclic lactones are
likely to be effective.
Control: Frequent removal of faeces and bedding on dry straw or
concrete will help reduce the risk of infection.
Ascarissuum
Common name: Large roundworm, white spot
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Description, gross: A. suum is by far the largest nematode of the pig; the
white, rigid females are up to 40.0 cm long and the males up to 25 cm in
length, and could only be confused with Macracanthorhyncus where this
occurs (Fig. 5.2).
Fig. 5.2 A knot of Ascaris suum recovered from the small intestine of an
infected pig.
Description, microscopic: The egg is ovoid and yellowish brown, with a
thick shell, the outer layer of which is irregularly mamillated. The egg is
777
larvated when passed in the faeces and the thick multilayered eggshell
enables the egg to survive desiccation and freezing in the environment for
several years.
Hosts: Pig, wild boar, rarely sheep, cattle, man
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. Though the pre- parasitic moults occur
by about 3 weeks after the egg is passed, a period of maturation is
 jo    i   i    ss
weeks after being passed, even in the optimal temperature range of
22-26°C. The egg is very resistant to temperature extremes, and is viable
for more than 4 years. After ingestion, the larvated egg hatches in the
small intestine, the L3 larva penetrates the intestinal mucosa and then

and thence to the small intestine via the bronchi, trachea and pharynx. In
the intestine the final moult occurs and the young adult worms inhabit the
lumen of the small intestine. If the eggs are ingested by an earthworm or
dung beetle they will hatch, and the L3 travel to the tissues of these
paratenic hosts, where they can remain, fully infective for pigs, for a long
worm is capable of producing more than 200 000 eggs per day. Longevity
is around 6-9 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The migrating larval stages in large numbers may cause
numerous small haemorrhages, emphysema and a transient pneumonia,

obstruction, and rarely a worm may migrate into the bile duct, causing
obstructive jaundice and carcase condemnation. Experimental infections
have shown that in young pigs the important effect of alimentary
ascariosis is economic, with poor feed conversion and slower weight
gains, leading to an extension of the fattening period by 6-8 weeks.
778
Fig. 5.3 Milk spot lesions in the liver associated with Ascaris suum.
Clinical signs: The main effect of the adult worms in pigs is to cause
production loss in terms of diminished weight gain. Otherwise, clinical
signs are absent except in the occasional case of intestinal or biliary
obstruction. Heavy infections may increase the susceptibility of young
pigs to other bacterial and viral pathogens. In piglets under 4 months old,
larval activity during the pulmonary phase of migration may cause a
clinically evident pneumonia, which is usually transient and rapidly
resolving. In sheep and cattle exposed to contaminated grazing, there may
be acute dyspnoea, tachypnoea and coughing following acute challenge
with migrating larvae in the lungs.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, history of disease, and, in
infections with the adult worm, on the presence in faeces of the
yellow-brown ovoid eggs, with thick mamillated shells. Being dense, the
eggs float more readily in saturated solutions of zinc sulphate or
magnesium sulphate than in the saturated sodium chloride solution, which
is used in most faecal examination techniques. Low counts of A. suum

Pathology: Larval migration induces lesions in the liver and lungs. In the
lungs, gross lesions are limited largely to numerous focal haemorrhages

some oedema, congestion and alveolar emphysema. Microscopically
there is an eosinophilic bronchiolitis. Bronchioles are surrounded by
macrophages and eosinophils, and the bronchiolar wall is infiltrated by
eosinophils, which are also present, with necrotic debris, in the lumen.
Larvae are usually readily found in tissue sections and may be present in
alveoli, alveolar ducts, bronchioles or bronchi, and in more chronic cases,
are found within eosinophilic granulomas. Lesions in the liver result in
considerable economic loss from condemnation at meat inspection.
Haemorrhagic tracks are present near portal areas and throughout lobules.
visible through the capsule as pinpoint red areas, sometimes slightly
depressed and surrounded by a narrow pale zone. These lesions collapse,
healing by fibrosis, which extends around portal tracts and extends out
more diffusely emphasising lobular outlines. Granulomatous foci
containing giant cells, macrophages and eosinophils may centre on the
remnants of larvae trapped and destroyed in the liver. The inflammatory
infiltrates in livers of animals exposed to larval ascarids may become
severe and diffuse, and this is reflected in the gross appearance of the
liver, which has extensive ‘milk spots’ and prominent definition of
lobules. The liver is firm, and heavy scars may become confluent,
obliterating some lobules and extending out to exaggerate interlobular
septa throughout the liver.
The pathogenicity of adult ascarids in the intestine is poorly defined.
Heavy infections may obstruct the gut, being visible as rope-like masses
through the intestinal wall. Ascarids may occasionally pass to the stomach
and be vomited or migrate up the pancreatic or bile ducts. Sometimes
biliary obstruction and icterus, or purulent cholangitis, may ensue. Rarely,
intestinal perforation occurs. On histology, there may be substantial
hypertrophy of the muscularis externa and elongation of the crypts of
Lieberkuhn, though height of villi is not significantly reduced.
Hypertrophy and exhaustion of the goblet-cell population and increased
infiltrates of eosinophils and mast cells are also observed in infected
intestines.

oedema. Microscopically, there is thickening of the alveolar septae, and
780
effusion of fluid and macrophages into the alveoli. Larvae present within
alveoli and bronchioles provoke an acute bronchiolitis.
Epidemiology: Young suckling piglets can become infected early after
birth through the ingestion of embryonated eggs that are attached to the
underbelly of the sow. Prevalence of infection is usually highest in pigs of
about 4 months of age onwards, and this, coupled with the fact that the
worms themselves have a limited life-span of several months, would
suggest that the main source of infection is the highly resistant egg on the
ground, a common characteristic of the ascaridoids. Hence ‘milk spot',
which is economically very important, since it is a cause of much liver
sisa id sos i od snon e sisd o
This condition has been widely noted to have a distinct seasonality of
occurrence, appearing in greatest incidence in temperate areas during the
warm summer months, and almost disappearing when the temperatures of
autumn, winter and spring are too low to allow development of eggs to the
infective stage. Also earthworms are generally more active and available
during the summer months. Sows and boars act as reservoirs of light
infection. A. suum may occasionally infect cattle, causing an acute,
atypical, interstitial pneumonia, which may prove fatal. In most cases
reported the cattle have had access to housing previously occupied by
pigs, sometimes several years before, or to land fertilised with pig manure.
In lambs, A. suum may also be a cause of clinical pneumonia as well as
'milk spot' lesions, resulting in condemnation of livers. In most cases
lambs have been grazed on land fertilised with pig manure or slurry, such
pasture remaining infective for lambs even after ploughing and cropping.
Young adults of A. suum are occasionally found in the small intestine of
but cross-infection is not of epidemiological significance.
Treatment: The intestinal stages are susceptible to most of the
anthelmintics in current use in pigs, and the majority of these, such as the
benzimidazoles, are given in the feed over several days. In cases of
suspected Ascaris pneumonia, injectable levamisole and ivermectin may
be more convenient. For 3-4 days posttreatment the faeces should be
removed from the pens and destroyed, as they often will contain large
numbers of eggs and expelled/disintegrating worms.
781
Control: In the past, elaborate control systems have been designed for
ascariosis in pigs, but with the appearance of highly effective
anthelmintics these labour-intensive systems are rarely used. The chief
problem in control is the great survival capacity of the eggs, but in housed
pigs, strict hygiene in feeding and bedding, with frequent hosing/steam
cleaning of walls, floors and feeding troughs will limit the risk of
infection. Some disinfectants and chemical solutions will limit infectivity.
In pigs on free range the problem is greater, and where there is serious
ascariosis it may be necessary to discontinue the use of paddocks for

receive anthelmintic treatment when purchased or on entry to the finishing
house and 8 weeks later; boars should be treated every 3-6 months.
Washing of the skin of sows prior to their removal to the farrowing pen
should reduce contamination with embryonated eggs.
Notes: The type species, Ascaris lumbricoides, occurs in man, and at one
time it was not differentiated from A. suum, so that the pig was thought to

veterinary medicine.
Strongyloides ransomi
Common name: Threadworm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Rhabditoidea
Description, gross: Slender, hair-like worms 3.44.5 mm long. Only
females are parasitic.
Description, microscopic: The long oesophagus may occupy up to one
third of the body length and the uterus is intertwined with the intestine
giving the appearance of twisted thread. Unlike other intestinal parasites
of similar size the tail has a blunt point. Strongyloides eggs are oval,
thin-shelled and small, 45-55 × 26-35 μm.
Hosts: Pig
782
Life cycle: Strongyloides is unique among the nematodes of veterinary
importance, being capable of both parasitic and free-living reproductive
cycles. The parasitic phase is composed entirely of female worms in the
small intestine and these produce larvated eggs by parthenogenesis, i.e.
development from an unfertilised egg. After hatching, larvae may develop
through four larval stages into free-living adult male and female worms
and this can be followed by a succession of free-living generations.
However, under certain conditions, possibly related to temperature and
moisture, the L3 can become parasitic, infecting the host by skin
penetration or ingestion and migrating via the venous system, the lungs
and trachea to develop into adult female worms in the small intestine.
Piglets  may  acquire  infection immediately  after  birth  from  the
mobilisation of arrested larvae in the tissues of the ventral abdominal wall
of the dam, which are subsequently excreted in the milk. In addition.
prenatal infection has been demonstrated experimentally in pigs. The
prepatent period is 6-9 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
erythematous reaction. Mature parasites are found in the duodenum and
with oedema and erosion of the epithelium. This results in catarrhal
enteritis with impairment of digestion and absorption.
Clinical signs: In light infections, animals show no clinical signs. In
heavy infections, there is bloody diarrhoea, anaemia and emaciation, and
sudden death may occur. During the migratory phase there may be
coughing, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Diagnosis: Demonstration of larvated eggs in faeces or the adults in
scrapings from the intestine on postmortem is diagnostic.
Pathology: The adult female worms burrow into the intestinal wall and
establish in tunnels in the epithelium at the base of the villi in the small
cause villous atrophy, with a mixed mononuclear inflammatory cell
infiltration of the lamina propria. Crypt epithelium is hyperplastic and
there is villous clubbing.
783
Epidemiology: Strongyloides infective larvae are not ensheathed and are
susceptible to extreme climatic conditions. However warmth and moisture
favour development and allow the accumulation of large numbers of
infective stages. Adult breeding stock may be infected with dormant
larvae in their subcutaneous fat. Pregnancy and farrowing appear to
stimulate the re-emergence of these larvae, which then may infect piglets
via the colostrum. This appears to be the major route of infection in young
piglets and, in only 7 days after birth, piglets may be passing eggs in their
faeces.
Treatment: Specific control measures for Strongyloides infection are
rarely called for. The benzimidazoles and the macrocyclic lactones may be
used for the treatment of clinical cases and a single dose of ivermectin
4-16 days prior to farrowing has been shown to suppress larval excretion
in the milk of sows.
Control: Strict hygiene and cleaning of pens before farrowing helps limit
levels of infection. Treating the sows before farrowing can also help
reduce infections in piglets.
Trichinella spiralis
Synonym:Trichina spiralis
Common name: Muscle worm
Predilection site: Small intestine, muscle
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: Because of their short lifespan, the adult worms are
rarely found in natural infections. The male is about 1.5 mm and the
female 3.5-4.0 mm long
Description, microscopic: The oesophagus is at least one third of the

contains developing larvae. Trichinella infection is most easily identified
by the presence of coiled larvae in striated muscle (Fig. 5.4). The cysts are
lemon-shaped, 0.3-0.8 x 0.2-0.4 mm in size and often transparent.
784
Hosts: Pig, rat, man, and most mammals
Life cycle: The life cycle is indirect. The adult parasites and infective
larvae (muscle trichinae) are unusual in being present within a single host
(i.e. development from larva to adult to larva in a single host). Trichinella
does not have a free-living stage. The developing adults lie between the
villi of the small intestine. After fertilisation, the males die while the
females burrow deeper into the intestinal mucosa. About a week later,
they produce L1 which enter the lymphatic vessels and travel via the
bloodstream to the skeletal muscles. There, still as L1, they penetrate
striated muscle cells where they are encapsulated by the host, grow and
assume a characteristic coiled position; the parasitised muscle cell is
transformed by microvascularisation into a ‘nurse cell'. This process is
complete within about 3-4 weeks, by which time the larvae are infective
and may remain so for many years. Development is resumed when
muscle, containing the encysted trichinae, is ingested by another host,
usually as a result of predation or carrion feeding. The L1 is liberated in
the stomach and in the intestine undergoes four moults to become sexually
mature within about a week. Patent infections persist for only a few weeks
at the most.
Fig. 5.4 Coiled infective larvae of Trichinelia spiralis in striated muscle.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, with the apparent exceptions of
Australia, Denmark and Great Britain
Pathogenesis: The adults occur in the glandular crypts of the proximal
small intestine and their larvae in the striated muscles; the diaphragmatic,
intercostal and masseter muscles and the tongue are considered to be the
main predilection sites. Infection in domestic animals is invariably light,
and clinical signs do not occur. However, when hundreds of larvae are
785
ingested, as occasionally happens in man and presumably also in
predatory animals in the wild, including cats and dogs, the intestinal
infection is often associated with catarrhal enteritis and diarrhoea, and 1-2
weeks later the massive larvalinvasionof the muscles causes acute
myositis, fever, eosinophilia and myocarditis. Periorbital oedema and
ascites are also common in man, sometimes accompanied by vomiting.

consequence of paralysis of respiratory muscles, but in persons who
survive this phase the clinical signs start to abate after 2-3 weeks.
Clinical signs: These are variable and depend on the host and the level of
infection. Signs are usually non-specific and resemble those of other
diseases, such as diarrhoea, fever, muscular pain, dyspnoea and peripheral
eosinophilia. T. spiralis infection in young pigs can induce inappetance,
weakness and diarrhoea. Older pigs are generally more tolerant of
infection.
Diagnosis: This is not relevant in live domestic animals. At meat
inspection, heavy larval infections may occasionally be just seen with the
naked eye as tiny greyish white spots. For routine purposes small samples
of pig muscle (taken from the preferential predilection sites) of about 1 g
are squeezed between glass plates, the apparatus being called a
low-power microscopic examination or projection onto a screen using a
trichinoscope. Alternatively, small portions of diaphragm tissue may be
 presence of larvae. The digestion method is now the preferred approach in
most countries as it is less expensive and labour intensive to perform. For
mass screening purposes, designed to determine the incidence of
trichinellosis in pigs within regions or for some high- volume
slaughterhouses, immunodiagnostic tests have been used. Of these, the
intestine where there is little associated pathology. Larvae are found in the
striated muscles with the diaphragmatic, intercostals, masseter muscles
and the tongue considered to be the main predilection sites. On microscpic
examination, the larvae lie in a bulging clear segment of muscle fibre,
which may be loosely encircled by eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells
786
and macrophages. In a heavy infection, a large proportion of the muscle
fibres in the predilection muscles may be infected with larvae and
surrounded by reactive zones. As the cellular reaction subsides, muscle
fibres surrounded by the larvae have the appearance of a fibrous capsule.
Once larvae become encysted, there is muscle fibre degeneration and
mineralisation, which doesn't appear to affect larval viability, as larvae
can survive for up to 20 years.
infection of animals in the wild and that the involvement of man in these
circumstances is accidental. The epidemiology of trichinellosis depends
on two factors. First, animals may become infected from a wide variety of
sources, predation and cannibalism being perhaps the most common.
Others include feeding on carrion, since the encapsulated larvae are
thought that transport hosts, such as crustaceans and fish, feeding on
drowned terrestrial animals, may account for infection in some aquatic
mammals such as seals.
The second factor is the wide host range of the parasite, infecting various
carnivores and omnivorous mammals. [n temperate areas rodents, brown
bear, badger and wild pig are most commonly involved; in the arctic, polar
bear, wolf and fox; in the tropics, lion, leopard, bushpig, hyena, jackal and
warthog. In these sylvatic or feral cycles, man and his animals are only

and subsequent ingestion of wild pigs may also produce disease in man
and his companion animals.

be a mode of transmission. Rats in piggeries also maintain a secondary

ingestion of infected flesh or faeces. Infection in man is acquired from the
ingestion of raw or inadequately cooked pork or its by-products, such as
sausages, ham and salami. It is also important to realise that smoking.

Trichinella to man.
In areas such as Poland, Germany and the USA, human trichinosis
acquired from pork has, until recently, been an important zoonosis. Over
the past few decades, prohibition of feeding uncooked food waste to pigs,
improved meat inspection and public awareness have greatly diminished
the significance of the problem. In Britain, and other countries in Europe,
and in the USA the numbers of outbreaks are few and sporadic.
The decreasing prevalence is also reflected in the fact that inapparent
infection in man, as shown by the presence of T. spiralis larvae in muscle
samples at necropsy, has decreased from 10% to not recorded in Britain,
and from 20% to under 5% in the USA over the past 50 years.
Treatment: Although rarely called for in animals, the adult worms and
the larvae in muscles are susceptible to several of the benzimidazole
anthelmintics, such as in-feed treatment with flubendazole in pigs.
Control: Probably the most important factor in the controlof
intended for consumption by pigs must be boiled (100°C for 30 minutes).
In fact, this practice is mandatory in many countries to limit the potential
spread of other diseases, such as foot and mouth disease and swine fever.
Other essential steps include:
1. Meat inspection, which plays an essential role in monitoring the
detection of infected carcases. Such carcases must be condemned.
2. Measures to eliminate rodents and other wild animals from piggeries
and slaughterhouses.
3. Prevention of exposure of pigs to dead animal carcasses, particularly of
rats and pigs.
4. Regulations to ensure that larvae in pork are destroyed by cooking or
freezing. In the USA, for example, any pork or pork products, other than
fresh pork, must be treated by heating or freezing before marketing and it
is likely also that irradiation might soon be introduced as a further method
of control.
5. Consumer education, and particularly the recognition that pork or pork
products or the flesh of carnivorous game should be thoroughly cooked
before consumption. It is worth noting that the larvae of Trichinella nativa
788
that occurs in wild carnivores and seals in some arctic and subarctic
regions is very resistant to freezing.

recently. It is composed of several sibling species, which cannot be
differentiated morphologically but molecular typing, and other criteria,
have now identified eight species of Trichinella (Table 5.1)
Macracanthorhynchushirudinaceus
Common name: Thorny-headed worm
Predilection site: Duodenum and proximal small intestine
Parasite class: Acanthocephala
Family: Oligacanthorhynchidae
Description, gross: Adults resemble Ascaris suum, but taper posteriorly.
The anterior of the worm possesses a retractable proboscis, which is
covered with recurved hooks (Fig. 5.5). The males are up to 10 cm and the
females around 60 cm in length and slightly pinkish in colour when fresh.
The worms are thick (5-10 mm in width) and the cuticle is transversely
wrinkled.
Description, microscopic: There is no alimentary canal. The egg is oval
with a thick greyish brown pitted shell and contains the acanthor larva
when laid. This larva has a small circle of minute hooks at the anterior.
789
Definitive hosts: Pig, wild boar, occasionally dog, wild carnivores and
man
Fig. 5.5 Head of Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus showing the
retractible proboscis.
Intermediate hosts: Various dung beetles and water beetles
Life cycle: Adults, attached to the small intestinal mucosa, lay eggs which
Aa aue 'siaqunu srel u! paonond ane asaul saaey aun u! passed ane
resistant toextremes of climate andcan survive for years inthe
environment. After ingestion by dung or water beetle larvae, the acanthor
develops to the infective cystacanth stage in approximately 3 months.
Infection of pigs occurs after ingestion of either infected beetle grubs or
adult beetles. The prepatent period is 2-3 months and longevity can be
aroundlyear.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, but absent from certain areas, for
example parts of western Europe
Pathogenesis: Mild infections are not very pathogenic, but heavy
infections may retard growth rates and cause emaciation.
Clinical signs: Low-level infections are usually asymptomatic. Heavy
infections may cause inappetence and weight loss.
Diagnosis: This is based on finding the typical eggs in the faeces. At

its proboscis and produces inflammation and may provoke granuloma
formation at the site of attachment in the wall of the duodenum and the
small intestine. Heavy infections may induce a catarrhal enteritis and,
rarely, penetration of the intestinal wall, which can result in a fatal
peritonitis.
Epidemiology: Infection is seasonal, being partly dependent on the
availability of the intermediate hosts. The eggs are able to remain viable in
the environment for several years. Infection tends to be more prevalent in
pigs of around 1-2 years of age.
Treatment: Although there is little information on treatment, levamisole
and ivermectin are reported to be effective.
Control: Pigs should be prevented from access to the intermediate hosts.

pigs are kept in small sties the faeces should be regularly removed to
reduce the prevalence of the dung beetle intermediate hosts.
Fasciolopsis buski
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Fasciolidae
Description, gross: Large, thick, elongate-oval fluke without shoulders,
broader posteriorly, and variable in size but usually measuring 30-75 x
 8-20 mm. The ventral sucker is situated near the anterior extremity and is
much larger than the oral sucker. The cuticle bears spines that are
frequently lost.
Description, microscopic: Eggs are brown, thin shelled with an
operculum, and measure 125-140 × 70-90 μm.
Final hosts: Pig, dog and man
791
Intermediate hosts: Flat, spiral-shelled freshwater snails of Planorbis
and Segmentina species
Life cycle: The life cycle is similar to F. hepatica. The final host is
infected through ingestion of metacercariae that encyst on aquatic plants.
The prepatent period is 9-13 weeks.
Geographical distribution: India, Pakistan, southeast Asia and China.
Pathogenesis: The parasite is mainly of importance as a cause of disease
in humans. It is located in the small intestine where it can cause severe
ulceration of the intestinal mucosa in heavy infections in man. Lesions are
less severe in the pig and dog.
Clinical signs: Infection causes abdominal pain, diarrhoea, oedema,
ascites and occasionally intestinal obstruction leading to malnutrition and
death in humans. Symptoms are less severe in pigs and dogs.
that have to be differentiated from eggs of Fasciola spp.
Pathology:  Heavier infections produce ulceration of  the intestinal
mucosa.
Epidemiology: The intermediate snail hosts feed on certain plants, water
calthrop (Trapa natans) and water chestnut (Eliocharis tuberosa), which
are cultivated for food and usually fertilised with human faeces. The
cercariae encyst on the tubers or nuts of these plants, and cause infection if
eaten raw. Pigs also become infected through eating these plants.
Treatment: Albendazole (10 mg/kg) and praziquantel (15 mg/kg) are
botheffective.
Control: The disease is easily preventable by avoiding raw or uncooked
aquatic plants in endemic areas. The introduction of good sanitation
facilities limits contamination of local watercourses and ponds.
Notes: F. buski is primarily a parasite of man, but can occur in the pig and
dog, which may act as reservoir hosts.
792
Coccidiosis
Although some ten species of coccidia have been described from pigs,
their importance is not clear. Isospora suis is a cause of a naturally
occurring severe enteritis in young piglets aged 1-2 weeks. Eimeria
debliecki has been described as causing clinical disease and severe
pathology; E. polita, E. scabra and E. spinosa cause moderate to mild
diarrhoeainpiglets.
The source of infection appears to be oocysts produced by the sow during
the periparturient period, the piglets becoming initially infected by
coprophagia; the second phase of diarrhoea is initiated by reinvasion from
tissue stages. Diagnosis of the condition is difficult unless postmortem
material is available since clinical signs occur prior to the shedding of
 s sod o   s on s a a p siss
rotavirus.

Diagnosis of coccidial infections is based on history and clinical signs,
and in patent infections, on the presence of oocysts of the pathogenic
species in the faeces. Oocysts may not be shed during the diarrhoeal phase
so faecal counts are not always of value.
Treatment for all species of Eimeria has generally relied on the use of a
sulphonamide/trimethoprim product combined with electrolyte and fluid
793
therapy. Treatment with several anticcocidial drugs, such as halofuginone.
salinomycin and diclazuril given orally to affected animals, has been
reported to be effective, although such treatments may not be licensed or
approved in many countries. Control of coccidiosis is based on reducing
environmental contamination by improved hygiene. Pens should be kept
clean and dry. Ammonia-based disinfectants can be used after thoroughly
cleaning farrowing pens by high-pressure hosing or steam disinfection.
Overcrowding of piglets and faecal contamination of food and water

 treatments are licensed or approved.
Isospora suis
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are spherical to subspherical, 17-25 × 16-22 μm
(mean 20.6 × 18.1 μm) and the wall is colourless and thin. There is no
micropyle or residuum and when sporulated the oocysts contain two

Hosts: Pig
Life cycle: Meronts are in the epithelial cells of the villi of the small
intestine usually in the distal third and below the host cell nucleus.

period of patency 3-13 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infection can occur in all types of farrowing facilities and
under all types of management systems. Piglets with clinical infection
develop a characteristic non-haemorrhagic disease that is unresponsive to
routine antibiotic therapy. Scours tend to occur in individuals from about 6
days of age, but most of the litter scours at 8-l0 days of age. The
diarrhoea ranges from white to pasty cream faeces through to a watery
diarrhoea. Affected piglets tend to be stunted and hairy. Severely affected

LARGEINTESTINE
Oesophagostomum
Six species of Oesophagostomum have been described from pigs. The
identification of individual species is beyond the scope of this book and
interested readers will need to consult a relevant taxonomic specialist.
Life cycle: The preparasitic phase is typically strongyloid and infection is
by ingestion of L3, although there is limited evidence that skin penetration
is possible in pigs. The L3 enter the mucosa of any part of the small or
large intestine then emerge on to the mucosal surface, migrate to the colon
and develop to the adult stage.
Pathogenesis: Oesophagostomum infections in the pig are not often
associated with clinical disease. Occasional diarrhoea, depression in
weight gain and poor food conversion may occur, especially during the
period of emergence of larvae and maturation of worms in the lumen of
804
the large intestine. Burdens of about 3000 to 20 000 adult worms are
associated with subclinical disease experimentally. Occasionally, infection
with Oesophagostomum, particularly mucosal damage precipitated by
larval encystment, may predispose to necrotic enteritis in association with
anaerobic flora and perhaps Balantidium.
Clinical signs: Pregnant sows show inappetence, become very thin, and
following farrowing, milk production is reduced with effects on litter
performance.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on postmortem findings and faecal egg
counts. Mixed infections with nodular worms and Hyostrongyius occur
frequently in pigs at pasture and their eggs are difficult to distinguish,
requiring faecal culture to distinguish L3.
Epidemiology: Infection is more prevalent in older pigs, which are
generally less susceptible to the pathogenic effects compared with
younger pigs. Survival of free- living L3 on the pasture and hypobiotic L4
in the host occur during autumn and winter; the hypobiotic larvae
Treatment: Adult worms are susceptible to benzimidazoles, levamisole
and macrocyclic lactones. Anthelmintic treatment does not always affect
the larvae within the nodules and repeat treatments several weeks apart are
required to reduce the worm population.
Control: Infections with Oesophagostomum are more likely to occur in
provision of clean pastures, rotation, mixed or alternate grazing and
strategic dosing regimes should be considered.

Several species of intestinal flukes belonging to the genera, Gastrodiscus
and Gastrodiscoides have been reported in pigs. Further details on the life
807
cycle, epidemiology, treatment and control of intestinal flukes are
 provided in Chapter 4 (Horses).
Gastrodiscus aegyptiacus
Common name: Intestinal fluke
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Paramphistomatidae
Description, gross: Adult flukes are pink in colour and measure 9-17 ×
8-11 mm. The anterior is up to 4 mm and cylindrical, whilst the rest of the
body is saucershaped, with the margins curved inwards.
Description, microscopic: The ventral surface is covered by a large
number of regularly arranged papillae. The oral sucker  has  two
postero-lateral pouches; the posterior sucker is small and subterminal.
Eggs are 0val and measure 131-139 × 78-90 μm.
Final hosts: Horse, pig, warthog
Intermediate hosts: Snails of the genus Bulinus and Cleopatra
Geographical distribution: Africa, India
Gastrodiscoideshominis
Synonym: Gastrodiscus hominis
Common name: [ntestinal fluke
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Paramphistomatidae
Final hosts: Pig, man
Geographical distribution: Asia

Whipworms
Trichuris suis
Synonym: Trichocephalus suis
Common name: Whipworms
Fig. 5.8 Trichuris suis on the surface of the large intestine.
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: The adults are whitish and about 3-5 cm long with a
thick broad posterior end tapering rapidly to a long filamentous anterior
end that is characteristically embedded in the mucosa (Fig. 5.8).
Description, microscopic: The male tail is coiled and possesses a single
spicule in a protrusible sheath. The sheath is variable in shape and in the
extent of its spinous armature. The female tail is curved. The characteristic
         x o    s
conspicuous polar plug at both ends; in the faeces these eggs appear
yellow or brown in colour.
Hosts: Pig, wild boar
809
Life cycle: The infective stage is the L1 within the egg, which develops in
1 or 2 months of being passed in the faeces depending on the temperature.
Under optimal conditions these may subsequently survive and remain
viable for several years. After ingestion, the plugs are digested and the
released L1 penetrate the glands of the distal ileum, caecal and colonic
mucosa. Subsequently, all four moults occur within these glands, the
adults emerging to lie on the mucosal surface with their anterior ends
embedded in the mucosa. The prepatent period is 6-8 weeks. Longevity is
4-5 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Most infections are light and asymptomatic. Occasionally,
when large numbers of worms are present, they cause a haemorrhagic
colitis and/or a diphtheritic inflammation of the caecal mucosa. This
results from the subepithelial location and continuous movement of the
anterior end to the whipworm as it searches for blood and fluid. In pigs,
heavy infections are thought to facilitate the invasion of potentially
pathogenic spirochaetes.
Clinical signs: Despite the fact that pigs have a high incidence of light
infections, the clinical significance of this genus is generally negligible,
heavy infection is occasionally seen and is associated with an acute or
chronic inflammation of the caecal mucosa with watery diarrhoea that
often contains blood. Anaemia may be present.
Diagnosis: Since the clinical signs are not pathognomonic, diagnosis may
depend on finding numbers of lemon-shaped Trichuris eggs in the faeces.
However, since clinical signs may occur during the prepatent period,
diagnosis in food animals may depend on necropsy.
Pathology: In severe cases, the mucosa of the large intestine is inflamed.
haemorrhagic with ulceration and formation of diptheritic membranes.
Epidemiology: The most important feature is the longevity of the eggs,
which may still survive after 3 or 4 years as a reservoir of infection in
piggeries. Generally pigs of around 2-4 months of age are the most
heavily infected.
Treatment: The benzimidazoles or levamisole by injection are effective
against adult Trichuris, but less so against the larval stage. Some
810
benzimidazoles need to be administered over several days. Doramectin is
effective.
Control: Prophylaxis is rarely necessary. Attention should be given to
areas where eggs might continue to survive for long periods. Such areas
should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected or sterilised by wet or dry
heat.
occasionally present in sufficient numbers to be clinically significant.
Trichuriosis in man: Trichuris trichiura, the whipworm of man and simian
primates, is morphologically indistinguishable from T. suis. However, it is
generally considered that these two parasites are strictly host specific.
Worldwide the number of cases in man is several hundred million, with
around 10 000 deaths per year attributed to trichuriosis. It is more
common in children.
Flagellateprotozoa
The life cycle of flagellate protozoa is similar for all species found in pigs.
The trichomonads reproduce by longitudinal binary fission. No sexual
stages are known and there are no cysts. Transmission is thought to occur
by ingestion of trophozoites from faeces. All are considered to be
the large intestine of fresh carcases.

Trichomitus rotunda
Synonym: Trichomonas buttreyi
Predilection site: Caecum, colon
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trichomonadidae
Description: The body is typically broadly piriform, but may occasionally
be ovoid or ellipsoidal. It is 7-11 × 5-7 μm (mean 9 x 6 μm). Cytoplasmic
inclusions are frequently  present. The three anterior flagella are

undulating membrane together with the costa, extends about 50-75% the
length of the body, and its undulation pattern varies from smooth to tightly
telescoped or coiled waves. The posterior free flagellum is generally
shorter than the body. The axostyle is a narrow, straight, non-hyaline rod
with a crescent or sickleshaped capitulum extending about 4 μm beyond
the body. The nucleus is practically spherical, 2-3 μm in diameter, with an
endosome surrounded by a clear halo. The parabasal body is 2-3 x

Other intestinal protozo0
Entamoeba suis
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite su bphylum: Sarcodina
Family: Endamoebidae
Description: Trophozoites are 5-25 μm in diameter. The nucleus varies in
appearance. The endostome is central and usually quite large and
sometimes fills the nucleus but may be small with a homogeneous ring of
peripheral chromatin. The cytoplasm is granular and vacuolated. The cysts
are 417 μm in diameter and contain a single nucleus and chromatin
 granules of varying shape and size.
Hosts: Pig
Life cycle: Trophozoites divide by binary fission. Before encysting the
amoebae round up, become smaller and lay down a cyst wall. Each cyst
has one nucleus. Amoebae emerge from the cysts and grow into
trophozoites
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Non-pathogenic
Diagnosis: Identification of trophozoites, or cysts in large intestinal
contents or faeces
Treatment and control: Not required
Balantidium coli
Predilection site: Large intestine
814
Parasite su bphylum: Ciliophora
Family:Balantididae
possesses rows of longitudinally arranged cilia (Fig. 5.10). At the anterior
end there is a funnel-shaped depression, the peristome, which leads to the
cytostome or mouth; from this, food particles are passed to vacuoles in the
cytoplasm and digested. Internally there are two nuclei, a reniform
macronucleus and adjacent micronucleus, and two contractile vacuoles.
which regulate osmotic pressure. Cysts are spherical to 0void, 40-60 μm
in diameter.
Hosts: Pig, man, camel, monkey, dog (rarely), rat
Life cycle: Reproduction is by binary fission. Conjugation, a temporary
attachment of two individuals during which nuclear material is exchanged,
also occurs, after which both cells separate. Eventually cysts are formed
which the parasite may be seen and are viable for 2 weeks at room
Fig. 5.10 Balantidium coli.
815
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Normally non-pathogenic, these protozoa may, for reasons
unknown, occasionally cause ulceration of the mucosa and accompanying
dysentery in the pig. Balantidium may be a secondary invader within
lesions of the large intestine.
Clinical signs: Occasionally causes diarrhoea or dysentery
Diagnosis: Balantidium is easily recognised by microscopic examination
of intestinal contents or by histological examination of intestinal lesions.
Pathology: The organisms are found in enormous numbers in the lumen
of the large intestine with normal caecal mucosa. The organism may,
however, be found within mucosal ulcers initiated by other infections. It
produces hyaluronidase, which might help to enlarge the lesions by
attacking the intercellular ground substance
large intestine of most pigs. Man may occasionally become clinically
816
affected through contamination of foodstuffs or hands with pig faeces.
Transmission occurs by ingestion of cysts or trophozoites. The cysts are
resistant to environmental conditions and can survive for weeks in pig
faeces. The pig is the usual source of infection for man and dogs.
Treatment: Tetracyclines are effective.
Control: Routine hygiene measures to prevent ingestion of cysts or faeces
should prevent infection.

for the occasional transmission of swine influenza virus.
817
Clinical signs: Most infections are light and asymptomatic, particularly in
older pigs. However, in heavy infections in young animals, coughing can

Secondary bacterial infection may complicate the signs, inducing
inappetance and loss of weight.
Diagnosis: For faecal examination saturated magnesium sulphate should
be used as the flotation solution because of the heavy density of the eggs.
The small rough-shelled larvated eggs are characteristic, but it should be
output may be sporadic in older pigs. The disease is most often
encountered in pigs on pasture, though an occasional outbreak has
occurred in yarded pigs. Disease history and clinical signs are also an aid
to diagnosis.
Pathology: During the prepatent period areas of pulmonary consolidation,
develop, often accompanied by areas of over-inflation. When the worms
are mature, and eggs are aspirated into the smaller air passages and
parenchyma, consolidation increases and emphysema is more marked.
Hypersecretion of bronchiolar mucus also occurs during this stage. About
6 weeks after infection, chronic bronchitis and emphysema are established
and small greyish nodules may be found in the posterior part of the

slowto resolve.
Epidemiology: Metastrongylosis shows a characteristic age distribution,
being most prevalent in pigs of 4-7 months old. It can be of high
prevalence in wild boar. The parasite is common in most countries,
although outbreaks of disease do not often occur, probably due to the fact
that most systems of pig husbandry do not allow ready access to
earthworms by pigs. Though it is often suggested that Metastrongylus may
transmit some of the porcine viruses, and may enhance the effect of
pathogens already present in the lungs, the role of the worm is not
conclusively proven.
Treatment: Many anthelmintics, including the modern benzimidazoles,
levamisole and the macrocyclic lactones, are highly effective.
818
Control: When pig husbandry is based on pasture, control is extremely
difficult because of the ubiquity and longevity of the earthworm
intermediate host. On farms where severe outbreaks have occurred, pigs
should be housed, dosed and the infected pasture cultivated or grazed with
other livestock.
Metastrongylus apri
Synonym: Metastrongylus elongatus
Common name: Pig lungworm
Predilection site: Lung
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Metastrongyloidea

58 mm.
Description, microscopic: The male bursa is relatively small and the
spicules are filiform and each end in a single hook. The vulva of the
female is near the anus. The posterior is curved ventrad.
Final hosts: Pig and wild boar; has been recorded in sheep, deer and in
other ruminants

survive for over a year in soil. Normally, however, they hatch almost
immediately, the intermediate host ingesting the L1. In the earthworm,
development to L3 takes about 10 days at optimal temperatures of
22-26°C. The longevity of the L3 in the earthworm is similar to that of the
intermediate host itself and may be up to 7 years. The pig is infected by
ingestion of earthworms and the L3, released by digestion, travel to the

detailed descriptions of individual species of trypanosomes, and their
control.
Trypanosoma brucei brucei
Subgenus: Trypanozoon
Common name: Nagana
Predilection site: Blood. T. brucei bucei is also found extravascularly in.
for example, the myocardium, central nervous system (CNS) and
reproductive tract.
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Hosts: Cattle, horse, donkey, zebu, sheep, goat, camel, pig, dog, cat, wild
game species
Distribution: Sub-Saharan Africa
Treatment: The two drugs in common use in cattle are isometamidium
and diaminazine aceturate and both should be suitable for use in pigs.
These are usually successful except where trypanosomes have developed
resistance to the drug or in some very chronic cases. Treatment should be
followed by surveillance, since reinfection, followed by clinical signs and
parasitaemia, may occur within a week or two. Alternatively, the animal
may relapse after chemotherapy, due to a persisting focus of infection in
its tissues or because the trypanosomes are drug-resistant.
Trypanosoma congolense congolense
Subgenus: Nannomonas
Common name: Nagana, paranagana, Gambia fever, ghindi, gobial
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Distribution: Sub-Saharan Africa
825
Treatment: In infected cattle, the two drugs in common use are
diminazene aceturate (Berenil) and homidium salts (Ethidium and
Novidium) and are appropriate for use in pigs infected with T. congolense
As with T. brucei, these drugs are usually successful except where
trypanosomes have developed resistance to the drug or in some very
chronic cases.
Trypanosoma simiae
Subgenus: Nannomonas
Synonym: Trypanosoma congolense simiae, T. rodhaini, T. porci
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: Tryptomastigotes are polymorphic, 12-24 μm long. Around
90% of the forms are long and stout with a conspicuous undulating
membrane; around 7% are long and slender with an inconspicuous
undulating membrane; and around 3% are short with an inconspicuous
undulating membrane. A free flagellum is usually absent.
Hosts: Pig, camel, sheep, goat
Distribution: Central Africa
Life cycle: T. simiae is mainly a parasite of warthogs transmitted by tsetse
flies, in which the parasites develop in the midgut and proboscis. Tsetse
flies also transmit the parasite to pigs, but transmission between pigs is
usually mechanically by biting flies. The trypanosome multiplies in the
iss     
Treatment: In pigs, T. simiae is the most important trypanosome
         
treatment. Isomethamidium chloride at increased dose rates of 12.5-35
mg/kg i.m. or a combination of quinapyramine (7.5 mg/kg s.c.) and
diaminazene
aceturate(5mg/kgi.m.)canbeused.A
suramin-quinapyramine complex (4 ml/5 kg) has shown some success in
prophylaxis in young piglets for a period of 3 months, and in adults for 5
months.

Hosts: Pig
Distribution: Central Africa
Treatment:As for T.simiae
BABESIA
Two species of Babesia are found in pigs. Babesia perroncitoi is a small
Babesia;B.trautmanni is a largeBabesia.Infection is transmitted to pigs
via tick vectors.
Life cycle: Multiplication of Babesia organisms in the vertebrate host
occurs in the erythrocytes by binary fission, endodyogeny, endopolyogeny
(budding) or merogony to form merozoites. These are liberated from the
erythrocyte and invade other cells. The asexual cycle continues
indefinitely and the animals may remain infected for life. The piroplasms
are transmitted by ticks but may also be transmitted by mechanical means
 am s a ad  ao a  a q a  p
round up and divide to form small round organisms. When the larval tick
moults into the nymph stage, the parasites enter the salivary gland and
undergo a series of binary fissions entering the cells of the salivary gland
acini. They multiply further until the host cells are filled with thousands of
minute parasites. These become vermiform, break out of the host cell and
lie in the lumen of the gland and are injected into the mammalian host
when the tick sucks blood.
827
Pathogenesis: The rapidly dividing parasites in the red cells produce
destruction of the erythrocytes with accompanying haemoglobinaemia,
haemoglobinuria and fever.
Diagnosis: The history and clinical signs of fever, anaemia, jaundice and
haemoglobinuria in pigs located in enzootic areas where ticks occur are
examination of blood films, stained with Giemsa, will reveal the parasites
in the red cells.
Pathology: The spleen is enlarged and there are pulmonary, renal and
gastrointestinal   hyperaemia   and   oedema.  Subepicardial   and
subendocardial haemorrhages are present with with petechiation present
on the serous membranes.
Treatment: Diminazene aceturate at 3.5 mg/kg i.m. is effective.
Control: Tick control measures can be considered for controlling disease.
Topical application of acaricides may provide some level of protection but

Babesia perroncitoi
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
Description: A ‘small’ Babesia occurring most commonly as annular
forms measuring 0.7-2 μm, although oval to pyriform forms, 1-3 μm x
1-2 μm in size, may also occur. Merozoites usually occur singly in
erythrocytes, but sometimes two or more may be present.
Hosts: Pig
Geographical distribution: Southern Europe, West and Central Africa,
Vietnam
828
Clinical signs: Clinical signs include fever, anaemia, haemoglobinuria.
jaundice, oedema and incoordination. Abortion may occur in pregnant
sOws.
Epidemiology: Wild pigs may act as reservoirs of infection and the tick
vectors include Rhipicephalus (R.appendiculatus,R. sanguineus) and
Dermacentor (D. reticulatus)
Babesia trautmanni
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
Description: A “large’ Babesia occurring as oval, pyriform and less
commonly round forms. Merozoites measure 2.5-4 x 1.5-2 μm, and
usually occur in pairs within erythrocytes, but sometimes four or more
may be present.
Hosts: Pig
Life cycle: As for B. perroncitoi
Geographical distribution: Southern Europe, Africa and parts of Asia
Clinical signs: Clinical signs include fever, anaemia, haemoglobinuria.
jaundice, oedema and incoordination. Abortion may occur in pregnant
sows. Mortality may reach 50% and pigs of all ages are affected.
Epidemiology: Infection and disease is seasonal according to the activity
of the tick vector. Wild boar and warthogs may act as reservoirs of
infection and the tick vectors include Rhipicephalus (R. appendiculatus, R.
sanguineus), Dermacentor (D. reticulatus) and Boophilus (B.decloratus).
Transovarian transmission has been reported in R. sanguineus.
Eperythrozoon suis
Synonym: Candidatus mycoplasma haemosuis
Predilection site: Blood
829
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Anaplasmataceae
Description: Pleomorphic coccobacilli occurring either as eperythrocytic
organisms in depressions on the cell surface, or free in the plasma. Single
parasitaemias. Cocci appear light blue with Giemsa or Romanowsky's
stains.
Hosts: Pig
Life cycle: Organisms are transmitted by biting insects and possible lice.
Replication takes place by binary fission or budding.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Among the Eperythrozoon, E. suis is the most pathogenic,
 ss   si e  aas a n  
have high fever and go on to develop anaemia, becoming weaker and
chronic syndromes. Acute infections often occur postpartum and affected
animals are pyrexic, anorexic and may show agalactia, mammary and
vulvular oedema. Chronic infections are usually subclinical and often
difficult to diagnose. Affected animals are generally in poor condition,
pale and jaundiced.
Clinical signs: Jaundice and anaemia in very young pigs
Diagnosis: Identification from staining artefacts requires good blood films
and filtered Giemsa stain. They appear as cocci or short rods on the
surface of the erythrocytes, often completely surrounding the margin of
the red cell. However, the organisms of Eperythrozoon are relatively
loosely attached to the red cell surface and are often found free in the
plasma.
Pathology: The main pathological changes occur in the liver and spleen.
In the liver there is fatty degeneration, atrophy and necrosis of central
hepatic cells with widespread lymphatic infiltration. Reticulo-endothelial
cells in liver, spleen and lymph nodes are hypertrophied and filled with
haemosiderin deposits.

and autumn when biting flies are active. The pig louse (Haemotopinus
suis) has also been incriminated in transmission.
Treatment and control: Tetracyclines and the arsenical, roxarsone, are
reported to be effective. Control of ectoparasite infections and possibly
addition of arsenicals or tetracyclines to the diet have been advocated in
countries where the disease is endemic.
Notes: The taxonomy of this species is subject to much debate and there is
a proposal to re-classify it into the bacterial genus Mycoplasma (class
Mollicutes) based on 16s rRNA gene sequences and phylogenetic
analysis.

base. The male bursa is short and the two spicules of either equal or
unequal length. Eggs are 100 × 60 μm.
Hosts: Pig, wild boar, rarely cattle
Life cycle: Pre-parasitic development from egg to L3 is typically
strongyloid, though earthworms may intervene as transport hosts. There
o     fo     s  
there is an immediate moult, and the L4 travel to the liver in the
bloodstream, either from the intestine by the portal stream, or from the
skin by the lungs and systemic circulation. In the liver the final moult
takes place, and the young adults wander in the parenchyma for 3 months
or more before piercing the capsule and migrating in the peritoneal cavity
           
reaction, and complete their development. The cyst communicates with
the ureter either directly or, if it is more distant, by a fine connecting
canal, allowing the worm eggs to be excreted in the urine. The prepatent
period ranges from 6-19 months and the worms have a longevity of about
2-3years.
Geographical distribution: Mainly warm to tropical regions of all
continents. It does not occur in western Europe.
     i s    
worms occur in the kidney itself, in the calyces and pelvis (Fig. 5.11).
Erratic migration is common in Stephanurus infection, and larvae have
been found in most organs, including the lungs, spleen, spinal cord, and in
muscle. In these sites they are trapped by encapsulation and never reach
the perirenal area. Prenatal infection has been reported.
The main pathogenic effect is due to the larvae, which, by the late L4
 s          n 
their wanderings. In heavy infections there may be severe cirrhosis,
832
thrombosis of hepatic vessels and ascites and, in rare cases, liver failure
and death. In most infections, however, the effects are seen only after
slaughter as patchy cirrhosis, and the main importance of the worm is
economic, from liver condemnation. In general the adult worms are not
pathogenic. Usually the adult worms, soon after arrival at the perirenal
site, are encapsulated in cysts, which may contain greenish pus. In rare
cases the ureters may be thickened and stenosed, with consequent
hydronephrosis.
Fig. 5.11 Stephanurus dentatus worms in a kidney.
Clinical signs: In most infections the only sign is failure to gain weight
or, in more severe cases, weight loss. Where there is more extensive liver
damage there may be ascites, but it is only when there is massive invasion,
comparable to acute fasciolosis in sheep, that death occurs.
Diagnosis: The clinical signs are likely to be few, and, since most of the
damage occurs during the prepatent phase, eggs may not be found in the
urine. However, in endemic areas, where pigs are failing to thrive and
where local abattoirs record appreciable numbers of cirrhotic livers, a
presumptive diagnosis can be made. Worms can be identified at necropsy.
Pathology: Percutaneous infection leads to the formation of nodules in the
skin, with oedema and enlargement of the superficial lymph nodes.
Migrating larvae produce acute inflammatory lesions especially in the
liver. Inflammation may lead to abscess formation and extensive liver
833
cirrhosis. The adult parasite is not markedly pathogenic and is found in
cysts, 0.5-4 cm in diameter, each cyst containing a pair of worms. Cysts
in the kidney may cause thickening of the ureter, which in chronic cases
may be almost occluded.
Epidemiology: Though the adult worms are never numerous, they are
very fecund, and an infected pig may pass a million eggs per day. The L3
is susceptible to desiccation, so that stephanurosis is mainly associated
with damp ground. Since it infects readily by skin penetration, the pigs?
habit of lying around the feeding area when kept outside presents a risk, as
does damp, unhygienic accommodation for housed animals. Such
conditions, coupled with prenatal infection and the longevity of the worm,
ensure continuity of infection through many generations of pigs. All ages
of pigs are susceptible to infection.
Treatment: Levamisole, the modern benzimidazoles and ivermectin are
effective.
Control: One approach to control is based on the susceptibility of the L3
to desiccation and on the fact that a major route of infection is
percutaneous. It follows that the provision of impervious surfaces around
the feeding areas for outdoor reared pigs, and simple hygiene, ensuring
clean dry flooring in pig houses, will help to limit infection. This approach
may be supplemented by segregating young pigs from those of more than
9 months of age, which will be excreting eggs.
The ^gilt only” scheme, which was advocated by workers in the United
States, consists essentially of using only gilts for breeding. The gilts are
reared on land, which is dry and exposed to the sun. A single litter is taken
from them, and as soon as the piglets can be weaned the gilts are
marketed. The scheme takes advantage of the extremely long prepatent
period which allows a single breeding cycle by the gilts to be completed
before egg laying begins and so progressively eliminates infection. The
boars used in the scheme are housed on concrete.
Regimes incorporating anthelmintic control recommend treatment of sows
and gilts 1-2 weeks before putting to the boar, and again 1-2 weeks
before farrowing. It should be remembered in designing a control system
infection.

PARASITES OF THE
LOCOMOTORY SYSTEM
Taenia solium
Synonym: Cysticercus cellulosae
Common name: Human pork tapeworm
Predilection site: Small intestine (final host); muscle (intermediate host)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: The adult tapeworm is 3-5 m long with a scolex,
typically taenid, having a rostellum with four suckers and armed with two
concentric rows of 22-32 hooks, while the uterus of the gravid segment
has 7-13 lateral branches. Adults can survive in humans for many years.
Description, microscopic: Cysts are milky white and have a scolex
bearing a rostellum and hooks similar to the adult.
Final host: Man
Intermediate hosts: Pig, wild boar, rarely dog and man
Life cycle: Gravid segments passed in the faeces each contain around 40
            s
period of time. After ingestion by a susceptible pig the oncosphere travels
via the blood to striated muscle. The principal location is the striated
muscles, but cysticerci may also develop in other organs, such as the
lungs, liver, kidney and brain. Humans become infected by ingesting raw
or inadequately cooked pork containing viable cysticerci. The human final
host may also act as an intermediate host and become infected with
cysticerci. This is most likely to occur from the accidental ingestion of T.
solium eggs via unwashed hands or contaminated food. There is also a
minor route of autoinfection, apparently, in a person with an adult
tapeworm, from the liberation of oncospheres after the digestion of a
835
gravid segment,which has entered the stomach from the duodenum by
reverse peristalsis. The prepatent period is 2-3 months.
Geographical distribution: This cestode is most prevalent in South and
Central America, India, Africa and parts of the Far East, apart from areas
where there are religious sanctions on the eating of pork. It is now
uncommon in many developed countries.
Pathogenesis: Clinical signs are inapparent in pigs naturally infected with
However, when humans are infected with cysticerci, various clinical signs
may occur depending on the location of the cysts in the organs, muscles or
oq aun go uo Araaa u pung aq A jas anss snoauns
in humans but are most common in the subcutaneous tissue, eye and brain.
Larvae that reach the brain develop in the ventricles and frequently
become racemose in character. Most seriously, cysticerci that develop in
the central nervous system produce mental disturbances or clinical signs
of epilepsy or increased intracranial pressure. They may also develop in
the eye with consequent loss of vision. In Latin America alone it is
estimated that almost 0.5 million people are affected, either by the nervous
or ocular forms of cysticercosis.
Clinical signs: Infected pigs are usually asymptomatic.
Infection is generally insignificant in humans although adult tapeworms
can occasionally cause abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. However
when man, acting as the intermediate host, is infected with cysticerci,
various clinical signs may occur depending on the location and number of
the cysts in the organs, muscles or subcutaneous tissue. CNS signs include
mental disturbances or clinical signs of epilepsy and may be fatal. Loss of
vision may occur when the eye is involved.
Diagnosis: For all practical purposes, diagnosis in pigs depends on meat
inspection procedures but this lacks sensitivity for low infection levels.
[ndividual countries have different regulations regarding the inspection of
carcases, but invariably the masseter muscle, tongue and heart are incised
and examined and the intercostal muscles and diaphragm inspected.
Proglottids can sometimes be seen in faeces. Cysticerci of T. sofium are
larger and more numerous than those of T. saginata (see Chapter 2
Cattle). In man the diagnosis of cerebral cysticercosis depends primarily
on the detection of cysticerci by CAT (computerised axial tomography)
836
scanning techniques, and on the finding of antibodies to cysticerci in the
cerebrospinal fluid.
Pathology: Cysticerci, comprising a single large cyst and inverted scolex,
measure 1-2 cm, and are easily visible between muscle fibres. The
cysticerci are rapidly ensheathed in connective tissue and create a
crescentic zone of degenerative lysis around them, thereby allowing room
to grow. Pigs are usually slaughtered at an age when all cysticerci are
generally still viable.
Epidemiology: In developing countries this depends primarily on the
close association of rural pigs with man, and in particular, their often
the gravid segments are not active and may remain in faeces. Humans
normally become infected when they consume raw or undercooked pork.
As noted above, man may become infected with cysticerci and this may
occur from the ingestion of eggs on vegetables or other foodstuffs
contaminated with human faeces or handled by an infected person.
Treatment: No effective drugs are available to kill cysticerci in the pig
although in man praziquantel and albendazole are considered to be of
some value as possible alternatives to surgery.
Control: This depends ultimately on the enforcement of meat inspection
regulations and deep-freezing procedures. Freezing pork at -10 to -8°C
continuously for 4 days kills the cysticerci, but chilling the meat at 0°C is
not sufficient and cysts may remain viable in chilled meat for 70 days. The
exclusion of pigs from contact with human faeces, the thorough cooking
of pork and proper standards of personal hygiene will reduce the
prevalence of infection.
Notes: A third form of Taenia (Asian Taenia') has been reported
throughout eastern Asia and also from parts of East Africa and Poland.
The ^Asian Taenia'appears to be closely related to T. saginata but its
molecular profile indicates that it is genetically different. The cysticerci of
this tapeworm are located in the liver of the pig and wild boar and
occasionally in cattle, goats and monkeys. The ‘Asian Taenia' is
considered not to be an important cause of human cysticercosis.

Trichinella spiralis
See under Small intestine.
Toxoplasma gondii
Predilection site: Muscle, lung, liver, reproductive system, central
nervous system
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystiidae
Description: Tachyzoites are found developing in vacuoles in many cell
types, for example fibroblasts, hepatocytes, reticular cells and myocardial
cells. In any one cell there may be 8-16 organisms, each measuring
6.0-8.0 μm. Tissue cysts, measuring up to 100 μm in diameter, found
mainly in the muscle, liver, lung and brain and may contain several
thousand lancet-shaped bradyzoites.
final host, the cat, may also be an intermediate host and harbour
extra-intestinal stages.
Final host: Cat, other felids
Life cycle: The definitive host is the cat in which gametogony takes place
(see Chapter 6: Dogs and cats). Pigs act as an intermediate host in which
the cycle is extra-intestinal and results in the formation of tachyzoites and
bradyzoites, which are the only forms found in non-feline hosts. The
liberated sporozoites rapidly penetrate the intestinal wall and spread by the
haematogenous route. This invasive and proliferative stage is called the
tachyzoite and on entering a cell it multiplies asexually in a vacuole by a
process of budding or endodyogeny, in which two individuals are formed
within the mother cell, the pellicle of the latter being used by the daughter
cells are infected. This is the acute phase of toxoplasmosis. In most
instances, the host survives and antibody is produced which limits the
invasiveness of the tachyzoites and results in the formation of cysts
containing thousands of organisms which, because endodyogeny and
growth are slow, are termed brady- zoites. The cyst containing the
bradyzoites is the latent form, multiplication being held in check by the
838
acquired immunity of the host. If this immunity wanes, the cyst may
rupture, releasing the bradyzoites, which become active and resume the
invasive characteristics of the tachyzoites.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Most Toxoplasma infections in animals are light and
consequently  asymptomatic.  Toxoplasmosis  has been  occasionally
but more usually is mild and unnoticed.
Diagnosis: Tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondi are often difficult to find in
tissue sections, but are more likely to be present in sections of brain and
placenta. Identification can be confirmed by immunohisto- chemistry,
while the polymerase chain reaction may be used to identify parasite DNA
in tissues. A number of serological tests have been developed of which the
dye test (DT) is the longest established serological method, and in many
ways represents the gold standard. Its reliability for use in pigs is not
known.
areas of necrosis in vital organs such as the myocardium, lungs, liver and
brain. Examination of the brain may reveal focal microgliosis. The lesions
often have a small central focus of necrosis that might be mineralised.
Focal leucomalacia in cerebral white matter, due to anoxia arising from
placental pathology, is often present.
toxoplasmosis and infection in pigs may occur through ingestion of feed
tachyzoites in the flesh of another intermediate host, such as rats.
Treatment: Not indicated
Control: On farms, control is difficult, but where possible animal
feedstuffs should be covered to exclude access by cats and insects. Control
of rats and regulation of feeding of swill to pigs are also measures that will
limit exposure to infection.
839
SARCOCYSTIS
Sarcocystis is one of the most prevalent parasites of livestock. Most cases
grossly visible sarcocysts in the muscle are discovered. Little is known of
the epidemiology, but from the high prevalence of symptomless infections
observed in abattoirs, it is clear that where dogs and cats are kept in close
association with farm animals or their feed, then transmission is likely.
The only control measures possible are those of simple hygiene. Farm
dogs and cats should not be housed in, or allowed access to, fodder stores
nor should they be allowed to defecate in pens where livestock are housed.
It is also important that they are not fed uncooked meat.

Description: Tissue cysts are compartmented up to 0.5-1.5 mm long x

by three asexual generations. In the first, sporozoites, released from the
sporocysts, invade the venules of the liver where they locate in endothelial

cells. The second-generation meronts are found in the endothelial cells of
capillaries of all organs and the resulting merozoites penetrate muscle
  go ss e   n  iso n a sll
within a cyst; this is the mature sarcocyst and is the infective stage for the
carnivorous final host. Cysts are found in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: S. suicanis is pathogenic to the pig and is known to
produce signs of enteritis, myositis and lameness. More generally clinical
signs are rarely observed and the most significant effect is the presence of
cysts in the muscles of food animals resulting in downgrading or
condemnation of carcases.
Clinical signs: In heavy infections of the intermediate hosts there may be
anorexia, fever, anaemia, loss of weight, a disinclination to move and
sometimes recumbency.
Pathology: In pigs, meronts present in endothelial cells of capillaries in
various organs lead to endothelial cell destruction. As the organisms enter
muscle, a wide range of change may be encountered. Microscopic
inspection of Sarcocystis-infected muscle oftenreveals occasional
inflammatory cells (very few of which are eosinophils) or, at a later stage,
macrophages and granulation tissue. Usually there is no muscle fibre
degeneration, but there may be thin, linear collections of lymphocytes
between fibres in the region. The extent of muscle change bears little
relationship to the numbers of developing cysts, but generally very low
numbers of Sarcocystis produce no reaction. As cysts mature, the cyst
capsule within the enlarged muscle fibre becomes thicker and more clearly
differentiated from the muscle sarcoplasm.

Sarcocystis suihominis
Synonym: Isospora hominis
Predilection site: Muscle
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystidae
Description: In the pig, the mature sarcocysts are thin-walled,
compartmented, up to 1.5 mm long, and have protrusions up to 13 μm
long, folded closely on the surface.
Intermediate hosts: Pig
Final host: Man, primates
Life cycle: Infection is by ingestion of the sporocysts and this is followed
by at least three asexual generations. In the first, sporozoites, released
from the sporocysts, invade the intestinal wall and the endothelial cells of
blood vessels in the liver, where they undergo two merogony cycles.

days and the patent period lasts at least 18 days.
Geographical distribution: Unknown
842
Pathogenesis: Infection is not pathogenic for nonhuman primates but is
extremely pathogenic for humans and the pig intermediate host. In the pig,
the principal pathogenic effect is attributable to the merogony stages in the
vascular endothelium of the liver.

between 5-9 and 11-15 days post infection. During the second phase,
there is apathy, dyspnoea, anaemia and cyanosis of the skin, muscle
spasms and hyperexcitability and prostration. Abortion may occur in
pregnant sows.
      e o   
faeces should be avoided. Human infection can be prevented through
adequate cooking or freezing of meat.
Notes: In humans, the ingestion of infected pork containing S. suihominis
produces clinical signs of bloat, nausea, loss of appetite, stomach ache,
vomiting, diarrhoea, difficulty breathing and rapid pulse within 6-42
hours. Sarcocystis may be responsible for several idiopathic diseases in
man, including cardiac diseases such as cardiomyopathy and myocarditis
and rheumatic diseases. It has also been suggested that Sarcocystis may be
associated with muscle aches and fatigue as part of the chronic fatigue
syndrome (CFS).

which are about 200 μm in length.
Final host: Pig
Intermediate hosts: Not known
Life cyele: Not known. The females appear to lay their eggs in the skin of

Geographical distribution: Southern Africa
Pathogenesis: The worms induce small hard whitish nodules in the
subcutaneous and intermuscular connective tissues. Infection is generally
considered to be non-pathogenic, although erupted skin vesicles may
become secondarily infected, forming abscesses.
Clinical signs: Infection is usually asymptomatic causing no effect on
productivity.
Diagnosis: This is normally based on clinical signs of small whitish
nodules, which eventually burst. Vesicular eruptions contain the eggs.
Pathology: Vesicular nodules may form in the cutaneous and
intermuscular connective tissue.
Epidemiology: The epidemiology is unknown.
Treatment: Treatment is seldom required as infection is of little
veterinary relevance.
Control: As the intermediate host is unknown control is not feasible or
usually required.
ECTOPARASITES
Haematopinus suis
Common name: Hog louse
844
Predilection site: Skin; most often present on skin folds of the neck and
jowl, the flanks and the insides of the legs on thin-coated animals.
Parasite class: [nsecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite suborder: Anoplura
Family: Haematopinidae
Description: Haematopinus suis is a large, greyish brown louse with
brown and black markings, measuring 5-6 mm in length. It is the largest
blood-sucking louse found on domestic animals. It has a long narrow head
and long mouthparts adapted for sucking blood. It has prominent angular
processes, known as ocular points or temporal angles, located behind the
antennae. Eyes are absent. The thoracic sternal plate is dark and well
developed. The legs are of similar sizes, each terminating in a single large
claw that opposes the tibial spur. Distinct sclerotised paratergal plates are
visible on abdominal segments 2 or 3 to 8.
Hosts: Pig
Life cycle: During a lifespan of about a month the female lays one to six
eggs per day. These are deposited singly, and are glued to the hairs on the
lower parts of the body and in skin folds on the neck, and on or in the ears,
where they may be seen with the naked eye. The eggs hatch within 13-15
days. The emerging nymphs resemble the adult louse except in size. In
about 12 days, the nymphs mature into adults and within 4 days, after
feeding and mating, the female lice begin to lay eggs. The entire life cycle,
from egg to adult, takes place on the host and is completed in 2-3 weeks.
Adults may live for up to 40 days but cannot survive for more than a few
days off the host. Between 6 and 15 generations may be completed per
year, depending on environmental conditions.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infested animals show a reduction in weight gain and are
more susceptible to other diseases. In severe infestations piglets may die
of anaemia. Haematopinus suis is believed to be a vector of African swine
fever, Eperythrozoon suis and the virus of swine pox.
845
Clinical signs: This louse is very common, and at low intensities is
usually tolerated without any signs apart from occasional mild irritation. It
usually occurs in the folds of the neck and jowl, around the ears and on the
flanks and backs. The majority of nymphs occur on the head region.
However, irritation is caused by the small but frequent blood meals, each
of which is taken via a different puncture wound. In heavy infestations,
pigs are restless and fail to thrive. Economically, the most important
feature of pediculosis in pigs is probably skin damage from scratching.
with reduction in hide value. In the most severe cases, pigs may rub most
of the hair off their bodies and, if acquired by piglets, Haematopinus suis
infestation may retard growth. Transfer is usually by contact but H. suis
may survive for up to 3 days off its host. Hence, transfer can also occur
when animals are put into recently vacated dirty accommodation.
Diagnosis: Haematopinus suis is the only louse found on pigs. Adults are
easily seen on the skin and can be removed and identified under a light
microscope.
Pathology: Both epidermis and corium may be affected by inflammatory
lesions at the bite puncture sites. Initially neutrophil infiltration with
necrosis of epithelial cells prevails. This is followed by capillary
proliferation with angioblast and fibroblast multiplication and straggled
lymphoid infiltration.
Epidemiology: Infection is primarily by physical contact between pigs,
particularly in closely confined fattening animals and in suckling sows
penned with their piglets. However, lice may also be acquired when
animals are put into recently vacated dirty accommodation.
Treatment: Avermectins given parenterally or the organophosphate
phosmet administered as a pour-on have both proved highly effective as a
single treatment. Amitraz and deltamethrin are also effective. Once lice
have been diagnosed it is essential to treat the entire herd.
Control: Generally, control is based on the application of insecticides or
use of a macrocyclic lactone. For herd prophylaxis, gilts and sows should
and boars treated twice annually.

Sarcoptes scabiei
Common name: Scabies
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Sarcoptidae
Description, adults: The adult of this species has a round, ventrally
flattened, dorsally convex body (Fig. 5.12). Adult females are 0.3-0.6 mm
long and 0.25-0.4 mm wide, while males are smaller, typically up to 0.3
mm long and 0.1-0.2 mm wide. The posterior two pairs of limbs do not
pairs of legs bear empodial claws and a sucker-like pulvillus, borne on a
long, stalk-like pretarsus. The sucker-like pulvilli help the mite grip the
substrate as it moves. The third and fourth pairs of legs in the female and
the third pair of legs in the male end in long setae and lack stalked pulvilli.
 The mouthparts have a rounded appearance. These mites have no eyes or
stigmata. The dorsal surface of the body of S. scabiei is covered with
transverse ridges, but also bears a central patch of triangular scales. The
dorsal setae are strong and spine-like. The anus is terminal and only
slightly dorsal. There are several host-adapted varieties of S. scabiei that
differ subtly in their morphology.

1956).
847
Description, larvae and nymphs: The hexapod larvae and the octopod
nymphs resemble the adults in general form.
Hosts: All domestic mammals and humans
Life cycle: The entire life cycle takes place on the host. Mating probably
takes place at the skin surface, following which the female creates a
permanent winding burrow, parallel to the skin surface, using her
chelicerae and the claw-like empodium on the front two pairs of legs. This
burrow may be up to 2-3 cm in length and burrowing may proceed at up
to 5 mm/day. Each tunnel contains only one female, her eggs and faeces.
Maturation of the eggs takes 3 or 4 days, following which the female starts
to oviposit one to three eggs per day, over a reproductive life of about 2
months. The eggs, which are oval and about half the length of the adult,
are laid singly at the ends of outpockets, which branch off along the length
of these tunnels. Three to four days after oviposition, the six-legged larva
hatches from the egg. Most larvae will crawl from the burrow towards the
848
skin surface, whilst some remain in the tunnels where they continue their
protonymph. During this time the larva and nymph find shelter and food
in the hair follicles. The protonymph moults to become a tritonymph and
again a few days later to become an adult.
Both sexes of adult then start to feed and burrow at the skin surface,
creating small pockets of up to 1 mm in length in the skin. Mating occurs
on the skin. The male dies shortly after copulation. After fertilisation,
female mites wander over the pelage to seek a suitable site for a
permanent burrow. Despite their short legs, adults are highly mobile,
capable of moving at up to 2.5 cm/min. Within an hour of mating the
female begins to excavate her burrow. Females burrow without direction,
eating the skin and tissue fluids that result from their excavations. Egg
laying begins 4-5 days after completion of the initial permanent winding
scratching they will attempt to burrow again.
The total egg to adult life cycle takes between 17 and 21 days, but may be
as short as 14 days. During this period, the mortality rate is high, with just
10% of mites that hatch completing their development. During an
infection mite numbers increase rapidly, then decline, leaving a relatively
stable mite population.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Host reactions occur primarily in response to the feeding
and burrowing activity of the mites and their faecal deposits. This
commonly occurs progressively 3 weeks into the initial infection. Lesions
can occur anywhere on the body, but are usually found on the head where

condition. Common signs are papular eruptions with erythema, pruritus
and hair loss. As the infestation progresses the skin becomes thickened,
the host scratching (Fig. 5.13). Scaly areas around the edge of lesions
indicate the spread of mites. Severe cases exhibit loss of appetite and
weight, impaired hearing, blindness and exhaustion.
Fig. 5.13 Sarcoptic mange in a pig.
Diagnosis: Useful diagnostic features of porcine sar- coptic mange are:
·The edges of the ears are often first affected, and on rubbing a
scratch reflex is readily elicited.
· There is always intense itching, so in cases of dermatitis where
there is no itch, sarcoptic mange can be eliminated as a possibility.
It is a highly contagious condition, and single cases are rarely seen
in groups of animals kept in close contact.
Confirmatory diagnosis is by examination of skin scrapings for the
presence of mites. However, since these are sometimes difficult to
demonstrate, a negative finding should not preclude a tentative diagnosis
of mange and initiation of treatment. For confirmatory diagnosis in pigs, a
reliable source of material for examination is wax from the ear.
Pathology: The first lesions appear as small red papules or weals and
general erythema about the eyes, around the snout, on the concave surface
of the external ears, in the axillae and on the front of the hocks where the
850
skin is thin. Scratching results in excoriation of these affected areas and
the formation of brownish scabs on the damaged skin. Subsequently, the
skin becomes wrinkled, covered with crusty lesions and thickened.
Epidemiology: New hosts are infected by contact with infected
individuals, presumably by the transfer of larvae, which are commonly
present more superficially on the skin surface. Transmission occurs
between mature animals and also from mother to offspring at birth.
Transfer of different host-adapted populations of S. scabiei between
different host species often results in only temporary infestations.
Infestation may also occur by indirect transfer, since the mites have been
shown to be capable of surviving off the host for short periods. The length
of time that S. scabiei can survive off the host depends on environmental
conditions but may be between 2 and 3 weeks. Consequently, animals
bedding may become contaminated and is a possible source of infestation
Treatment: In pigs, effective preparations that have been used include
amitraz, trichlorphon and bromo- cyclen. Newer and more convenient
products with a better residual effect are the systemic organophosphate
pour-on phosmet and the macrocyclic lactones.
Control: In pigs, a common control approach is to treat the sow (the main
reservoir of infection) before she goes into the farrowing crate or pen.
This procedure will be more successful than having to treat partly grown
pigs. The offspring of treated sows show better growth rates and shorter
finishing periods than those of untreated sows. It is most important that
boars are routinely treated at 6-monthly intervals, and any newly
introduced boar is treated and quarantined as they can readily infect sows
at service. In the treatment of affected pigs, acaricide may be applied
weekly, by wash or by spray, until the signs have regressed. It is

alternative, systemic macrocyclic lactones may be given.
Demodexphylloides
Predilection site: Hair follicles and sebaceous glands, particularly the
eyelids
Parasite class: Arachnida
851
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Demodicidae
Description: Species of Demodex have an elongate tapering body, up to
 0.1-0.4 mm in length, with four pairs of stumpy legs ending in small blunt
claws in the adult (Fig. 6.32). Setae are absent from the legs and body.
The legs are located at the front of the body, and as such the striated
opisthosoma forms at least half the body length.
Hosts:Pig
Life cycle: Demodex spp usually live as commensals in the skin, and are
highly site-specific, occupying the hair follicles and sebaceous glands.
Females lay 20-24 spindle-shaped eggs in the hair follicle that give rise to
hexapod larvae, in which each short leg ends in a single, three-pronged
claw. Unusually, a second hexapod larval stage follows, in which each leg
ends in a pair of three-pronged claws. Octopod protonymph, tritonymph
and adult stages then follow. Immature stages and these migrate more
   h     s   
concurrently. The life cycle is completed in 18-24 days. In each follicle or
gland the mites may occur in large numbers in a characteristic
head-downward posture. In the newborn and very young these sites are
   q    s  d
The presence of Demodex mites much deeper in the dermis than
sarcoptids means that they are much less accessible to surface-acting
acaricides. Species of Demodex are unable to survive off their host.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infestation is usually confined to the head, where there is
erythema, papules and thickened skin. If there is secondary bacterial
infection or follicular rupture, pustules and nodules may be observed.
Clinical signs: Erythema, papules and thickened skin on the head
Diagnosis: For confirmatory diagnosis, deep scrapings are necessary to
reach the mites deep in the follicles and glands. This is best achieved by

Pathology: Lesions typically involve the ventral abdomen, ventral neck.
eyelids and snout. They commence as small red macules, developing intc
releases thick white caseous debris.
Epidemiology: Probably because of its location deep in the dermis, it is
difficult to transmit Demodex between animals unless there is prolonged
contact. Such contact occurs most commonly at suckling. This mange is
rare in pigs, although sporadic incidences of up to 5% have been noted in
eastern European countries
Treatment: In many cases demodecosis spontaneously resolves and
treatment is unnecessary. The organo- phosphates (e-g. malathion,
coumaphos, diazinion, fenchlorvos, chlorfenvinphos, phosmet
or
Control: Control is rarely applied
Notes: Species of the genus Demodex are highly specialised mites that
live in the hair follicles and sebaceous glands of a wide range of wild and
 domestic animals, including humans. They are believed to form a group of
closely related sibling species, which are highly specific to particular
hosts: Demodex phylloides (pig), Demodex canis (dog), Demodex bovis
(cattle), Demodex equi (horse), Demodex musculi (mouse), Demodex ratti
(rat), Demodex caviae (guinea-pig), Demodex cati (cat) and Demodex
follicuforum and Demodex brevis on humans. Various morphological
variations may be seen on a host; these are sometimes, probably
incorrectly, ascribed separate species status.

Tetratrichomonascanistomae
Synonym: Trichomonas canistomae
Predilection site: Mouth
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trichomonadidae
Description: The body is piriform, 7-12 x 3-4 μm. The four anterior
flagella are about as long as the body and arise in pairs from a large
blepharoplast (Fig. 6.1). The undulating membrane extends almost the
length of the body, and terminates in a free posterior flagellum, which is
about half the length of the body. The axostyle is threadlike, stains black
with haematoxylin and extends a considerable length beyond the body.
The costa is slender and there are no subcostal granules.
Hosts: Dog
857
Life cycle: The trichomonads reproduce by longitudinal binary fission. No
sexual stages are known and there are no cysts.
Geographical distribution: Unknown
Pathogenesis: Considered non-pathogenic
Diagnosis: Morphological identification of the organisms from fresh and
stained mouth swab preparations. The organisms can also be cultured in a
range of media used for trichomonads.
Epidemiology:   Transmission presumably occurs

Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
colour; males are around 30-55 mm, and females 55-80 mm.
Description, microscopie: The lips are trilobed and the pharynx is short.
The male tail bears lateral alae, four pairs and one unpaired median
pre-cloacal papillae and two pairs of post-cloacal papillae, with a group of
il x ios 'shus y a sg d  a u d 
 μm and are larvated when passed in faeces.
Final hosts: Dog, fox, wild canids and occasionally cat and wild felids
859
Intermediate hosts: Coprophagous beetles: Scarabeus sacer, Akis,
Atenchus, Gymnopleurus, Cauthon spp. Many vertebrates such as rodents,
birds, insectivores and reptiles can act as paratenic hosts.
Life cycle: The thick-shelled elongate egg, containing a larva, is passed in
the faeces or vomit and does not hatch until ingested by a dung beetle. In
this, the intermediate host, the larva develops to the L3 and encysts.
Paratenic hosts may also be involved if the dung beetle, in turn, is ingested
by any of a variety of other animals including the domestic chicken, wild
birds and lizards. In these the L3 becomes encysted in the viscera. On
ingestion of the intermediate or paratenic host by the final host the L3 are
liberated, penetrate the stomach wall and migrate via the coeliac artery to
the thoracic aorta. About 3 months later the majority of larvae cross to the
adjacent oesophagus where they provoke the development of granulomas
as they develop to the adult stage in a further 3 months. The prepatent
period is therefore about 6 months. Eggs, however, may not be found in
the faeces of a proportion of animals with adult infections where the
 granulomas have no openings into the oesophageal lumen.
Geographical distribution: Tropical and subtropical areas
Pathogenesis: The migrating larvae produce haemorrhages, scarring and/
or the formation of fibrotic nodules on the internal wall of the aorta,
which, if particularly severe, may cause stenosis or even rupture. The
oesophageal granulomas, up to 4.0 cm in size, associated with the adult
worms, may be responsible for a variety of clinical signs including
dysphagia and vomiting arising from oesophageal obstruction and
inflammation.
Two further complications are, first, the development of oesophageal
osteosarcoma in a small proportion of infected dogs. These may be highly
invasive and produce metastases in the lung and other tissues. Secondly,
also relatively rare, is the occurrence of spondylosis of the thoracic
vertebrae or of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy of the long
bones. The aetiology of these lesions is unknown. Occasionally S. lupi
infection can induce a pyaemic nephritis.
Clinical signs: Despite the potential pathogenicity of this parasite, many
lesions and large, often purulent, oesophageal granulomas are present. In
some dogs infection will induce persistent vomiting with worms passed in
860
the vomit. In less serious cases there may be difficulty in swallowing or
interference with the action of the stomach. Aortic infection is not usually
observed until sudden death is caused by rupture.
Diagnosis: The location and appearance of the granulomatous lesions, up
to golf-ball size, is usually sufficient for identification. Numerous
pink-reddish, stout, spirally coiled worms may be seen on section of the
granulomas, but these are difficult to extricate intact since they are coiled

are fistulae in the oesophageal granulomas. However, the eggs are similar
in appearance to those of other spirurids. Otherwise diagnosis may depend
on endoscopy or radiography.
Pathology: The migrating larvae produce characteristic lesions in the wall
of the aorta (Fig. 6.2) while the adults are found embedded in
granulomatous lesions in the wall of the oesophagus and occasionally the
stomach.  Aortic lesions  include haemorrhage  and  necrosis with
eosinophilic inflammation, intimal roughening with thrombosis, aneurysm
with rare aortic rupture, and subintimal and medial mineralisation and
heterotopic bone deposition. Spondylosis of the ventral aspects of thoracic
vertebrae occurs in some cases with exostoses of the vertebral bodies.
Granulomas in the oesophagus contain pleomorphic fibroblasts. In some
animals mesencymal neoplasms develop in the wall of the oesophageal
granuloma with lesions showing cytological characteristics typical of
fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma, with local tissue invasion and, in many
cases, pulmonary metastasis.
often extremely high, sometimes approaching 100%. Probably this is
associated with the many opportunities of acquiring infection from the
variety of paratenic hosts.
Fig. 6.2 Fibrotic nodules on the internal wall of the aorta from a dog
infected withSpirocerca lupi.
861
Treatment: Treatment is rarely practical, but levamisole and albendazole
have been reported to be of value. Levamisole is given at 5-10 mg/kg as a
single dose. Diethylcarbamazine at oral doses of 10 mg/kg twice daily for
10 days may kill adult worms but not larvae.
Control: This is difficult because of the ubiquity of the intermediate and
paratenic hosts. Dogs should not be fed uncooked viscera from wild birds
or from free-range domestic chickens.
STOMACH
Ollulanus tricuspis
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: This is a very small trichostrongyle. Males are
0.7-0.8mm, and females 0.8-1 mm long.
Description, microscopic: The worm is identified microscopically by the
spiral coil of the head. The male bursa is well developed and the spicules
are stout and each is split into two for a considerable distance. The female
has a tail with three or four short cusps. The vulva is in the posterior part
of the body and there is only one uterus and ovary.
862
Hosts: Cats, wild felids; occasionally found in pigs, foxes and domestic
dogs
Life cycle: The worms are viviparous, the larvae developing to the L3
stage in the uterus of the females. Autoinfection can occur, the shed L3
developing into adult worms on the gastric mucosa in around 45 weeks.
The whole life cycle may be completed endogenously and transmission, at
least in the cat, is thought to be via ingestion of vomit containing the L3.
The worms live under a layer of mucus in the stomach wall and the
anterior end of the worm is often located within the gastric crypts.
Geographical distribution: Mainly occurs in Europe, North and South
America, Australasia and the Middle East.
infections may induce a severe catarrhal gastritis and vomiting. Untreated
hosts, although a chronic gastritis has been reported in the pig.
Clinical signs: Occasional vomiting and emaciation.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis of ollulanosis is seldom made because of their small
size and lack of eggs and larvae in the faeces. Examination of vomit,
following an emetic, for the presence of worms is a useful approach. At
gastric mucosa should lead to a diagnosis.
Pathology: The worms lie beneath the mucus on the surface of the
stomach, or partly in the gastric glands, and their presence may lead to
mucosal lymphoid hyperplasiaand elevated numbers of globule
thrown into folds.
Epidemiology: The parasite is common in some parts of the world.
        s   
in the stomach without any need for external egg or larval phases and can
spread via vomit. The disease spreads mainly among starving stray cats
and sometimes stray dogs.
Treatment: Levamisole, ivermectin or repeated doses of oxfendazole at
1 0 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days are effective.
863
Control: This is mainly achieved through the implementation of good
hygiene procedures.
Spirocerca lupi
See under Oesophagus.
Gnathostoma spinigerum
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Thick-bodied worms, reddish at the front, and greyish
posteriorly. The males are 1-2.5 cm and the females up to 3.0 cm long.
The presence of the worms in gastric nodules is sufficient for generic
diagnosis.
Description, microscopic: Confirmation is easily made with a hand lens
each communicate with a cervical sac. The anterior of the body is covered
with flat cuticular spines and the ventral caudal region of the male bears
small spines and four pairs of large pedunculate papillae as well as several
smaller sessile ones. The left spicule is longer than the right. Eggs are
Oval, greenish, 69 × 37 μm with a thin cap at one pole.
Final hosts: Cat, dog, man, mink, polecat and several wild carnivores
Intermediate hosts: Host 1: Many species of freshwater crustaceans,
copepods. Host 2: Small vertebrates including mammals, birds, reptiles,
fish and amphibians
Life cycle: The adult worms live in tunnels in the gastric nodules, and the
eggs pass from there into the lumen and are dropped into the water in the
intermediate hosts) ingest L1 and development to L2 takes place. The
crustaceans are themselves ingested by vertebrates (second intermediate
hosts), such as fish, frogs and reptiles, and development to L3 occurs and
the larvae become encysted. The L3 can also encyst in many mammals
864
such as mice, rats and dogs. The final host is infected by ingestion of the
vertebrate vector and further development occurs in the stomach wall,
where the worms provoke the growth of fibrous lesions.
Geographical distribution: Thailand, Japan, South East Asia, China,
Mexico
Pathogenesis: G. spinigerum is the most pathogenic Gnathostoma
        
In some cases a number of larvae will migrate from the stomach to other
organs, most commonly the liver, in which they burrow, leaving necrotic
tracks in the parenchyma
Clinical signs: Gnathostoma infection in the cat may cause acute
abdominal signs.
Diagnosis: The infection in the living animal can only be diagnosed by
d o e d n e  m s go  a go  
in the faeces. Often, however, eggs are not present in faeces.
Pathology: As in many spiruroid infections, the most obvious effect of
gnathostomosis is the presence of fibrous growths on the stomach wall.
These growths are of variable size, the largest being 3-4 cm in diameter,
and are cavitated, amounting to thick-walled cysts containing worms and
fluid. Ulceration and necrosis of the stomach wall are often present.
Epidemiology: Dogs, cats and several species of wild mammals are
reservoirs of the parasite. These final hosts become infected primarily
through eating infected fish or other animals that serve as paratenic hosts.
In humans, the ingestion of raw or inadequately cooked fish is the major
poorly cooked catfish, eels, frogs, chickens, ducks and snakes.
Treatment: Treatment has not been fully investigated

complete control cannot be achieved. Ensuring only well cooked fish.
eels, or other intermediate hosts, such as snakes, frogs, and poultry, are
eaten can prevent infections. Potentially copepod infested water should be
boiled or treated.
865
Notes: Like most spiruroids, Gnathostoma inhabits the upper alimentary
tract, occurring in nodules in the stomach wall of omnivores and
species.
When visceral larva migrans due to Gnathostoma occurs in humans, G.
spinigerum is the species usually involved, and the commonest source of

second intermediate hosts. Infection is particularly common in southeast
Asia, Japan and China but occurs in many other countries. The worms
never become fully adult, and the immature forms are most commonly
found in nodules in subcutaneous tissues and other organs that appear and
disappear irregularly as the parasites wander in various parts of the body.
[In humans, cutaneous gnathostomiosis can result in pruritic swellings and
eosinophilia with occasional abscess formation. Ocular gnathostomiosis is
characterised by haemorrhage, uveitis and perforation of the iris. A severe
form of infection is central nervous system (CNS) gnathostomiosis,
Physaloptera praeputialis
Predilection site: Stomach

as a sheath beyond the end of the body. The lips are simple and bear a set
of three flattened, internal teeth and a single conical external tooth. The
male bears lateral alae, joined anteriorly across the ventral surface. In the
female the vulva is slightly anterior to the midbody. The larvated eggs
have a thick clear shell and measure 45-58 μm × 3042 μm.
Final hosts: Cat and wild felids; occasionally the dog
Intermediate hosts: Beetles, cockroaches, crickets and paratenic hosts
866
Geographical distribution: China, Africa, North and South America
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically spiruroid. Eggs passed in the faeces
of the infected host develop into infective larvae if ingested by
coprophagous beetles. The life cycle is completed when cats ingest the
intermediate hosts. Various transport hosts may also be involved in
transmission of infection. The prepatent period is around 8-10 weeks.
lips, and attach strongly to the gastric mucosa, leaving small ulcers when
they move to fresh sites. These feeding sites may continue to bleed. They
may cause catarrhal gastritis, with emesis, and in heavy infections blood
may appear in the faeces.
Clinical signs: In heavy infections there may be vomiting and some
degree of anorexia. The faeces may appear dark in colour. Severely
affected animals may lose weight.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and by the finding of the
elongate eggs, thickened at either pole, in the faeces or vomit.
Pathology: Presence of the adult worms may cause gastric ulceration and
haemorrhage.
Epidemiology: The epidemiology depends on the presence and
abundance of the intermediate beetle hosts. Infection is more prevalent in
Treatment: Treatment with benzimidazoles over a 5-day period has been
reported to be effective. Pyrantel is also effective.
Control: The ubiquity of the insect intermediate hosts means that control
is not usually feasible.
Physaloptera rara
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Hosts: Cat
867
Description, gross: Adult male worms are 2.5-3 cm long and females
3-6cm.
Description, microscopic: This species differs from P. praeputialis in
that there is no sheath over the posterior portion of the body in both sexes.
The female vulva is anterior to the middle of the body. Eggs are
thick-shelled and ellipsoid, 42-53 × 29-35 μm.
Geographical distribution: North America
Details of the life cycle, pathogenesis, treatment and control are
essentially similar to those of P. praeputialis.
Spirura ritypleurites
Predilection site: Stomach, occasionally oesophagus
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Thick, short white worms with the posterior region
thicker than the anterior of the worm and twisted in a spiral.
Description, microscopic: The eggs have a thick shell and are
embryonated when passed.
Final hosts: Cat, rarely dog, fox
Intermediate hosts: Coprophagous beetles
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically spiruroid. Eggs develop into
infective larvae within an intermediate host. Larvae may then be ingested
by paratenic hosts, such as rodents and lizards, in which they become
encapsulated. Cats become infected by ingesting the insects or their
transport hosts.
Geographical distribution: This worm is endemic in parts of southern
Europe, Africa and Asia.
Pathogenesis: S. ritypleurites is usually presumed to be non-pathogenic.
Clinical signs: Symptoms of nausea, vomiting and digestive upsets have
been reported.
868
Diagnosis: As for Physaloptera spp
Pathology: No associated pathology reported
Epidemiology: The epidemiology depends  on the presence and
abundance of the intermediate beetle hosts. Infection is more prevalent in
outdoor cats that have access to intermediate hosts or paratenic hosts.
Treatment: Not usually indicated. Treatment with a benzimidazole over
an extended period is likely to be effective.

Capillaria putorii
Synonym: Aonchotheca putorii
Predilection site: Stomach, small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda

Description, gross: These are thin, filamentous worms, about 1 cm long:
males are 5-8 mm and females 9-15 mm.
Description, microscopic: Eggs have broad flat poles and granular
unsegmented contents.
Hosts: Cat, dog, mustelids, hedgehog
Life cycle: Cats are thought to become infected by eating infective eggs
from soil contaminated by hedgehog faeces.
Geographical distribution: Europe, New Zealand
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: There are few reports on the clinical
signs of infection in cats. Infected cats have reported anorexia and
intermittent bloody vomitus.
Diagnosis: Identification of the characteristic eggs in faeces
869
Pathology: There is reported chronic, hyperplastic pyloric gastritis and
ulceration around the pylorus associated with the presence of worms with
eggs present in the pyloric mucus and in the lumen of the pyloric glands.
2-week intervals, and ivermectin, at 300 μg/kg, have been reported to be
effective.
SMALL INTESTINE
Toxocara canis
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Deseription, gross: Toxocara canis is a large white worm up to about
18.0 cm in length; males are around 10 cm, and females up to 18 cm (Fig
6.3).
Description, microscopic: The adult head is elliptical due to the presence
of large cervical alae. The mouth is surrounded by three large lips. There
is no buccal capsule and the oesophagus lacks a bulb. The tail of the male
has a terminal narrow appendage and caudal alae. Female genital organs
extend anteriorly and posteriorly to the vulval region. The egg is dark
brown and subglobular, 90 x 75 μm with a thick, pitted shell.

superfamily, with four possible modes of infection.
The basic form is typically ascaridoid, the egg containing the L3 being
infective, at optimal temperatures, 4 weeks after being passed. After
ingestion, and hatching in the small intestine, the larvae travel by the
bloodstream via the liver to the lungs, where the second moult occurs, the
larvae returning via the trachea to the intestine where the final two moults
take place. This form of ascaroid migration occurs regularly only in dogs
Of up to about 2-3 months old.

support hepatic-tracheal migration as adults.Instead of hepatic-tracheal
migration, the L3 travel to a wide range of tissues including the liver,
lungs, brain, heart and skeletal muscle, and the walls of the alimentary
tract.
In the pregnant bitch, prenatal infection occurs, larvae becoming
mobilised at about 3 weeks prior to parturition and migrating to the lungs
Of the fetus where they moult just before birth. In the newborn pup the
and the final moults occur. A bitch, once infected, will usually harbour
sufficient larvae to infect all her subsequent litters, even if she never again
encounters the infection. A few of these mobilised larvae, instead of going
to the uterus, complete the normal migration in the bitch, and the resulting
adult worms produce a transient but marked increase in faecal Toxocara
egg output in the weeks following parturition.
The suckling pup may also be infected by ingestion of L3 in the milk
d an un  o    ro sam e n a 
following infection by this route. Paratenic hosts such as rodents or birds
may ingest the infective eggs, and the L3 travel to their tissues where they
remain until eaten by a dog when subsequent development is apparently
confined to the gastrointestinal tract.
A final complication is recent evidence that bitches may be reinfected
during late pregnancy or lactation, leading directly to transmammary
infection of the suckling pups and, once patency is established in the bitch,
to contamination of the environment with eggs. The bitch may be
puppies through her coprophagic activities.
The known minimum prepatent periods are:
· Direct infection following ingestion of eggs or larvae in a paratentic
host: 4-5 weeks
·Prenatal infection: 2-3 weeks
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: In moderate infections, the larval migratory phase is
accomplished without any apparent damage to the tissues, and the adult
worms provoke little reaction in the intestine. In heavy infections the
872
pulmonary phase of larval migration is associated with pneumonia, which
a mucoid enteritis, there may be partial or complete occlusion of the gut
and, in rare cases, perforation with peritonitis or in some instances
blockage of the bile duct.
Clinical signs: In mild to moderate infections, there are no clinical signs
during the pulmonary phase of larval migration. The adults in the intestine
may cause tucked-up abdomen or potbelly, with failure to thrive, and
occasional vomiting and diarrhoea. Entire worms are sometimes vomited
Or passed in the faeces. The signs in heavy infections during larval
infection occur during the pulmonary phase, and pups, which have been
heavily infected transplacentally may die within a few days of birth.
Nervous convulsions have been attributed by some clinicians to
toxocariosis, but there is still some disagreement on whether the parasite
can be implicated as a cause of these signs.
Diagnosis: Only a tentative diagnosis is possible during the pulmonary
phase of heavy infections when the larvae are migrating, and is based on
the simultaneous appearance of pneumonic signs in a litter, often within 2
weeks of birth. The eggs in faeces, subglobular and brown with thick,
pitted shells, are species-diagnostic. The egg production of the worms is
found in simple faecal smears to which a drop of water has been added.
T. canis in the dog can be confused only with Toxascaris feonina which is
only useful character, visible with a hand lens, is the presence of a small
finger-like process on the tail of the male T. canis.
Pathology: On postmortem, the animal appears poorly grown, potbellied
and cachectic. Large numbers of maturing worms are present in the
intestines and sometimes the stomach. Focal haemorrhages may be found
in the lungs of puppies with migrating T. canis larvae. Inflammatory foci
are often observed in the kidneys as white, elevated spots 1-2 mm in
of a small focus of macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and a few
eosinophils, possibly containing larvae. Occasionally, granulomas may be
found in theeye.
873
Epidemiology: Surveys of T. canis prevalence in dogs have been carried
out in most countries and have shown a wide range of infection rates, from
5% to over 80%. The highest rates of prevalence have been recorded in
dogs of less than 6 months of age, with the fewest worms in adult animals.
Infectioninduces immunity that results in loss of adult worms.
The widespread distribution and high intensity of infection with T. canis
depend essentially on three factors. First, the females are extremely
fecund, one worm being able to contribute about 700 eggs to each gram of
faeces per day, and egg counts of 15 0o0 epg are not uncommon in pups.
Second, the eggs are highly resistant to climatic extremes, and can survive
for years on the ground. Third, there is a constant reservoir of infection in
the somatic tissues of the bitch, and larvae in these sites are not
susceptible to most anthelmintics.
Treatment: The adult worms are easily removed by anthelmintic
treatment. The most popular drug used has been piperazine, although this
mebendazole) and by nitroscanate. Pyrantel and the avermectin,
selamectin,  are also effective.  Although several  anthelmintics have
activity against larval stages and juvenile worms, none are fully effective
at their removal.
A simple and frequently recommended regime for control of toxocariosis
in young dogs is as follows. All pups should be dosed at 2 weeks of age,
pups. A further dose should be given to the pups at 2 months old, to
     jo       
increase in faecal egg output by the dam in the weeks following whelping.
Newly purchased pups should be dosed twice at an interval of 14 days
Since there are likely to be a few worms present, even in adult dogs, in
spite of the diversion of the majority of larvae to the somatic tissues, it is
recommended that adult dogs should be treated every 3-6 months
throughout their lives.
It has been shown that daily administration of high doses of fenbendazole

eliminated transmammary and prenatal infection of the pups, although

be useful in breeding kennels.
Control: The main aim is to prevent transmammary and intrauterine
transmission of infection using the anthelmintic treatment regimens listed
practical, access of rodents to kennels should be prevented.
Notes: Apart from its veterinary importance, this species is responsible for
the most widely recognised form of visceral larva migrans (VLM) in
man. Though this term was originally applied to invasion of the visceral
tissues of an animal by parasites whose natural hosts were other animals,
it has now, in common usage, come to represent this type of invasion in
humans alone and, in particular, by the larvae of Toxocara canis, although
the larval stages of T. mystax, T. leonina and T. vitulorum (see Chapter 2:
Cattle, Small intestine) can be implicated. [ts complementary term is
cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), for infections by *foreign’ larvae, which
are limited to the skin.
The global condition occurs most commonly in children, often under 5
years of age, who have had close contact with household pets, or who
have frequented areas such as public parks where there is contamination
of the ground by infective dog faeces. Surveys of such areas in many
countries have almost invariably shown the presence of viable eggs of T.
canis in around 10% of soil samples. Despite this high risk of exposure to
infection, the reported incidence of clinical cases is small. For example, in
1979 a French survey of the world literature reported that only 430 cases
of ocular, and 350 cases of visceral, larva migrans had been recorded.
However, it has been suggested that 50-60 clinical cases occur in Britain
each year, since many are not recorded.
[n many cases, larval invasion is limited to the liver, and may give rise to
hepatomegaly and eosinophilia, but on some occasions a larva escapes
into the general circulation and arrives in another organ, the most
frequently noted being the eye. Here, a granuloma forms around the larva
on the retina, often resembling a retinoblastoma. Only in rare cases does
the granuloma involve the optic disc, with total loss of vision, and most
reports are of partial impairment of vision, with endophthalmitis or
granulomatous retinitis. Such cases are currently treated using laser
therapy. In a few cases of epilepsy, T. canis infection has been identified
875
serologically, but the significance of the association has yet to be
established.
Control of visceral larva migrans is based on the anthelmintic regimen
described above, on the safe disposal of dog faeces in houses and gardens.
and on the limitation of access by dogs to areas where children play, such
as public parks and recreation grounds.
Toxocara mystax
Synonym: Toxocara cati
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Description, gross: Typical of the superfamily, Toxocara mystax is a
large white worm (up to 10 cm in length), often occurring as a mixed
infection with the other ascaridoids of cats, such as Toxascaris leonina.
Males are 3-6 cm, females 4-10 cm.
Description, microscopic: The tail of the male has a terminal narrow
appendage. Differentiation is readily made between Toxocara mystax and
Toxascaris leonina on gross examination or with a hand lens, when the
cervical alae of the former are seen to have an arrow-head form, with the
posterior margins almost at a right angle to the body, whereas those of
Toxascaris taper gradually into the body (Fig. 6.4). The male, like that of
 n  go d a  s - s  s ' o
egg, subglobular, 65-75 μm with a thick, pitted shell and almost
colourless, is characteristic in cat faeces.
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: The life cycle of T. mystax is migratory when infection occurs
by ingestion of the L2 in the egg, and non-migratory after transmammary
infection with L3 or after ingestion of a paratenic host.
Fig. 6.4 Comparison of the anterior region of (a) Toxocara mystax and (b)

Following ingestion of eggs containing an infective second-stage larva.
the larvae enter the stomach wall and then migrate via the liver, lungs and
trachea back to the stomach and moult to L3, while L4 occur in the
stomach contents, the intestinal wall and bowel contents. Rodent
infections also play an important part in the life cycle. In these, larvae
remain as second-stage forms but when an infected mouse is eaten by a
cat the larvae, liberated by digestion, enter the stomach wall of the cat and
develop to L3. As well as mice acting as “intermediate hosts', L2 may be
found in the tissues of earthworms, cockroaches, chickens, sheep and
Other animals fed infective eggs.
Transmammary infection is common throughout lactation and the
lactogenic route of transmission is the most important. Prenatal infection
does not occur. The prepatent period from egg infection is about 8 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Because the majority of infections are acquired either in
the milk of the dam, or by ingestion of paratenic hosts, there is no

showing as potbelly, diarrhoea, poor coat and failure to thrive.
Clinical signs: Unthriftiness, potbelly, diarrhoea
Diagnosis: The subglobular eggs, with thick, pitted shells, are easily
recognised in faeces.
Pathology: Larvae developing in the mucosa of the stomach may provoke
a mild granulomatous reaction comprising lymphocytes and a few
macrophages around the coiled larvae.
Epidemiology: The epidemiology of T. mystax depends largely on a
reservoir of larvae in the tissues of the dam, which are mobilised late in
pregnancy and excreted in the milk throughout lactation. The paratenic
host is also of considerable significance because of the strong hunting
instinct in cats. Exposure to the latter route of infection does not occur
 jo     o s     s 
dams.
Treatment: Fenbendazole, mebendazole, piperazine and pyrantel are all
effective against adult nematodes. The benzimidazole anthelmintics are
more effective against larval ascarids.
Control: Since infection is first acquired during suckling. complete
control would be based on removal of kittens from the dam and artificial
rearing. Good hygiene is essential in catteries. Young kittens should be
wormed regularly with an anthelmintic from 4-6 weeks of age at 3-week
intervals until 4 months of age and thereafter at regular intervals.
Notes: T. mystax has been reported as a rare cause of visceral larva
migrans in man.
Toxocara malayiensis
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
878
Description, gross: Toxocara malayiensis is a large white worm; males
are 5.3-8.5 cm, females 1.1-1.4 cm, morphologically similar to 7. canis in
saop
Description, microscopic: There are three well defined lips, each with a
deep median notch lined with denticles: a dorsal lip with two large outer
papillae, and two subventral lips each with one outer papilla. Cervical alae
arise immediately behind the lips, gradually increasing in width to
mid-length, then tapering gradually posteriorly
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: The life cycle has not been fully described.
Geographical distribution: Malaysia
Diagnosis: The subglobular eggs, with thick-pitted shells are similar to
those of T. canis.
Epidemiology: Not described
Treatment and control: Presumed similar to T. mystax.
Details of the pathogenesis, pathology and clinical signs have not been
reported.
Toxascaris leonina
Synonym:Toxascarislimbata
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
 il m dn say  s o  o dn ae s ssoe uosa
Description, microscopic: Adults have an elliptical head due to presence
of large cervical alae. Three large lips surround the mouth, there is no
buccal capsule and the oesophagus lacks a bulb. The tail of the male is
simple. The female genital organs lie behind the level of the vulva. The
egg is slightly ovoid, light coloured, 75 × 85 μm with a smooth thick shell,
and is characteristic in dog and cat faeces.
879
Hosts: Dog, cat, fox
Life cycle: The infective stage is the egg containing a second-stage larva
or the third-stage larvae present in a mouse intermediate host. Following
ingestion and hatching, larvae enter the wall of the intestine and remain
for about 2 weeks. No migration of larvae occurs as with other ascarid
about 2-5 weeks post infection. Adult stages appear from about 6 weeks
post infection and lie in the lumen of the intestine. The prepatent period is
10-1l weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infection with Toxascaris is unlikely to occur in isolation
and is more usually accompanied by a Toxocara infection. In puppies and
young dogs less than 2 months of age the infection is usually absent as
there is no prenatal or lactogenic transmission. Damage is caused
predominantly by the adult worms and is determined by the number of
worms present in the intestine.
Clinical signs: Unthriftiness, potbelly, diarrhoea
Diagnosis: Toxascaris is almost indistinguishable grossly from Toxocara
process at the tip of the male tail of the latter. In the cat, differentiation
from Toxocara mystax is based on the shape of the cervical alae, which
are lanceolate in Toxascaris but arrowhead shaped in Toxocara mystax.
 The characterisitic ovoid, smooth-shelled eggs are easily recognised in the
faeces.
Heavy infections may cause occlusion of the intestinal lumen and are
usually associated with the mixed presence of Toxocara spp.
Epidemiology: Infection normally occurs through the ingestion of the
larvated eggs. Larvae of Toxascaris feonina may occur in mice with the
third-stage larvae distributed in many tissues. If a dog or cat ingests an
infected mouse the larvae are released and develop to maturity in the wall
and lumen of the intestine of the final host
880
Treatment: Fenbendazole, mebendazole, piperazine and pyrantel are all
effective against adult nematodes. The benzimidazole anthelmintics are
more effective against larval ascarids.
Control: Ascarid infections in the domestic carnivores invariably include
Toxocara, such that the measures recommended for control of the latter
will also have an effect on Toxascaris. Since the two main reservoirs of
infection are larvae in the prey or eggs on the ground, control has to be
hygiene to limit the possibility of acquisition of infection by ingestion of
eggs.
Notes: This genus occurs in domestic carnivores, and though common, is
   s    i sl eos
non-migratory.
Ancylostoma caninum
Common name: Canine hookworm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ancylostomatoidea
Description, gross: The worms are reddish grey in colour, depending on
whether the worm has fed, and are readily recognised on the basis of size.
and by their characteristic *hook-like' posture. Males are about 12 mm and
females 15-20 mm in length, (much smaller than the common ascarid
nematodes, which are also found in the small intestine).
Description, microscopic: The anterior end is bent dorsad and the oral
pairs of marginal teeth and a pair of ventro-lateral teeth and possesses a
dorsal gutter (Fig. 6.5). The male bursa is well developed. Eggs are
'strongylate' with dissimilar poles, barrel-shaped sidewalls, 56-75 x
3447 μm and contain two to eight blastomeres.
Hosts: Dog, fox and occasionally man
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct and, given optimal conditions, the eggs
881
Paratenic hosts can also be important. In percutaneous infection, larvae
migrate via the bloodstream to the lungs where they moult to L4 in the
bronchi and trachea, and are then swallowed and pass to the small
intestine where the final moult occurs. If infection is by ingestion the
larvae may either penetrate the buccal mucosa and undergo the pulmonary
migration described above or pass directly to the intestine where the adult
worms burrow their buccal capsules into the mucosa. Whichever route is
taken, the prepatent period is 14-21 days. The worms are prolific egg
layers and an infected dog may pass millions of eggs daily for several
weeks.
Fig. 6.5 Head of Ancylostoma caninum showing the large buccal capsule
containing pairs of teeth.
An important feature of A. caninum infection is that, in susceptible
muscles where they remain dormant until the bitch is pregnant. They are
then reactivated and, still as L3, are passed in the milk of the bitch for a
period of about 3 weeks after whelping. Transplacental transmission does
not occur.
Geographical distribution:  Worldwide in  the  tropics and warm
from endemic regions.
882
Pathogenesis: This is essentially that of an acute or chronic haemorrhagic
anaemia. The disease is most commonly seen in dogs under 1 year old and
young pups, infected by the transmammary route, are particularly
susceptible due to their low iron reserves. Transmammary infection is
  s  o s i    is o
second or third week of life. Infection of the bitch on a single occasion has
been shown to produce transmammary infections in at least three
consecutive litters.
Following infection, blood loss starts about the eighth day of infection
when the immature adult has developed the toothed buccal capsule, which
enables it to grasp plugs of mucosa containing arterioles. Each worm
removes about 0.1 ml of blood daily and in heavy infections of several
hundred worms pups quickly become profoundly anaemic. In lighter
infections, common in older dogs, the anaemia is not so severe, as the
marrow response is able to compensate for a variable period. Ultimately
however, the dog may become iron deficient and develop a microcytic
hypochromic anaemia. [n previously sensitised dogs, skin reactions such
as moist eczema and ulceration at the sites of percutaneous infection occur
especially affecting the interdigital skin.
It appears that dormant L3 in the muscles of both bitches and dogs can
recommence migration months or years later to mature in the host's
intestine. Stress, severe illness or repeated large doses of corticosteroids

inahookworm-freeenvironment
Experimentally, L3 of some strains of A. caninum exposed to chilling
before oral administration have been shown to remain in arrested
development in the intestinal mucosa for weeks or months. The
significance of this observation is still unknown, but it is thought that such
        
removed by an anthelmintic or at times of stress, such as lactation.
Clinical signs: In acute infections, there is anaemia and lassitude and
occasionally respiratory embarrassment. In suckled pups the anaemia is
often severe and is accompanied by diarrhoea, which may contain blood
and mucus. Respiratory signs may be due to larval damage in the lungs or
to the anoxic effects of anaemia. In more chronic infections, the animal is
usually underweight, the coat is poor, and there is loss of appetite and
perhaps pica. Inconsistently there are signs of respiratory embarrassment,

an ailing dog is suffering from hookworm disease.
Pathology: Animals dying of ancylostomosis are extremely pale and there
is often oedema of subcutaneous tissues and mesenteries, and serous
chronic infections, cachexia may be evident. If recent exposure to heavy
percutaneous infection has occurred there may be dermatitis and
numerous focal haemorrhages in the lung parenchyma. The liver is pale
and the intestinal contents are mucoid and red in colour. Worms may be
seen attached to the mucosa and pinpoint haemorrhagic sites may be
scattered over the intestinal surface.
Epidemiology: In endemic areas the disease is most common in dogs
under l year old. In older animals, the gradual development of age
resistance makes clinical disease less likely, particularly in dogs reared in
endemic areas, whose age resistance is reinforced by acquired immunity.
The epidemiology is primarily associated with the two main sources of
infection, transmammary in suckled pups and percutaneous or oral from
the environment. An important aspect of transmammary infection is that
e   e   snd n i o  
anthelmintic and has a negative faecal egg count. Contamination of the
environment is most likely when dogs are exercised on grass or earth runs
that retain moisture and also protect larvae from sunlight. On such
surfaces, particularly if exposed to sunlight, are lethal to larvae within a

lead to a massive build-up of infection.
Treatment: Affected dogs should be treated with an anthelmintic, such as
mebendazole, fenbendazole, pyrantel or nitroscanate, all of which will kill
884
both adult and developing intestinal stages; several of the macrocyclic
lactones have similar activity. If the disease is severe, it is advisable to
give parenteral iron and possibly vitamin B12 and to ensure that the dog
uisnysuen pooq e aunbau Aeu sdnd sunoa lap yoi-uod e sey
Control: A system of regular anthelmintic therapy and hygiene should be
adopted. Weaned pups and adult dogs should be treated every 3 months.
Pregnant bitches should be dosed at least once during pregnancy with an
anthelmintic that has high efficacy against somatic larvae, so as to reduce
transmammary infection, and the nursing litters dosed at least twice, at
1-2 weeks of age and again 2 weeks later with a drug specifically
infections. The perinatal transfer of both Ancylostoma and Toxocara
larvae may be reduced by the oral administration of fenbendazole daily
from 3 weeks before to 2 days after whelping.
Kennel floors should be free of crevices and dry and the bedding should
be disposed of daily. Runs should preferably be of tarmac or concrete and
kept as clean and dry as possible; faeces should be removed with a shovel
before hosing. If an outbreak has occurred, earth runs may be treated with
sodium borate, which is lethal to hookworm larvae, but this also kills
grass. A second possibility, which is often used in fox farms, is the
 provision of wire-mesh flooring in the runs.
Notes: A. caninum can occasionally use man as a final host. Although
infections do not reach full maturity, they may induce an eosinophilic
enteritis.
Ancylostoma braziliense
Common name: Hookworm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ancylostomatoidea
Description, gross: As for A. caninum except it is smaller than either A.
caninum or A. tubaeforme. In the dog, males measure around 7.5 mm and
females 9-10 mm in length.
885
Description, microscopic: The buccal capsule is deep with two pairs of
large dorsal and very small ventral teeth. Eggs are similar to A. caninum,
measuring around 75-95 × 41-45 μm.
Hosts: Dog, cat
Life cycle: Similar in many respects to A. caninum, using both oral and
percutaneous routes of infection, but transmammary transmission has not
been demonstrated. Rodents can act as paratenic hosts. The prepatent
period is about 2 weeks in the dog and cat.
Geographical distribution: Tropical and subtropical regions
Pathogenesis: While it may cause a degree of hypoalbuminaemia through
an intestinal leak of plasma, it is not a blood sucker and consequently is of
little pathogenic significance, causing only mild digestive upsets and
occasional diarrhoea. The main importance of A. brazifiense is that it is
regarded as the primary cause of cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) or
'creeping eruption’ in man. CLM is characterised by tortuous
erythematous inflammatory tracts within the dermis and by severe
   d  a   s  r
wandering in the dermis. These larvae do not develop, but the skin lesions
usually persist for weeks. The severity of the skin lesions relate to the
degree of exposure to infective larvae.

become infected via the consumption of paratenic hosts, such as infected
mice. The prepatent period is about 15 days.

dermatitis, affecting particularly the interdigital skin.
Clinical signs: Anaemia, diarrhoea, anorexia, lethargy, interdigital
dermatitis
Diagnosis: In areas where A. caninum is absent, the clinical signs of the
patent infection, together with the demonstration of strongyle eggs in the
faeces, is indicative of uncinariosis. Where Ancylostoma is also endemic,
differential diagnosis may require larval culture, although the treatment is
similar.
Pathology: Severe hookworm infections cause villous fusion and atrophy
in the small intestine and an inflammatory response in the lamina propria.
Epidemiology: Evidence suggests that in temperate climates like the UK
the seasonal pattern of infective larvae on paddocks used for greyhounds
follows that described for gastrointestinal trichostrongyloids in ruminants
 s s u d e e ir u a s e 
development to the L3 is heavily dependent on temperature.
Treatment: Fenbendazole, mebendazole, nitroscanate, piperazine,
pyrantel and milbemycin oxime are all active against the northern
hookworm.
Control: Regular anthelmintic treatment and good hygiene as outlined for
Ancyfostoma will control Uncinaria infection. The combination of
ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate or a formulation of chewable ivermectin
can give high efficacy. The pedal dermatitis responds poorly to
symptomatic treatment, but regresses gradually in the absence of
reinfection.
Strongyloides stercoralis
Synonym: Strongyfoides canis,S. intestinalis,Anguilfuia stercoralis
Common name: Threadworm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
890
Superfamily: Rhabditoidea
Description, gross: Slender, hair-like worms around 1mm long. Only
females are parasitic.
Description, microscopic: The long oesophagus may occupy up to one
third of the body length and the uterus is intertwined with the intestine.
giving the appearance of twisted thread. Unlike other intestinal parasites
of similar size the tail has a blunt point. Strongyloides eggs are oval,
thin-shelled and small, 50-58 × 30-34 μm. The hatched L1 is passed out
in the faeces.
Hosts: Dog, fox, cat, man
Life cycle: Strongyloides is unique among the nematodes of veterinary
importance, being capable of both parasitic and free-living reproductive
cycles. The parasitic phase is composed entirely of female worms in the
small intestine and these produce larvated eggs by parthenogenesis, i.e.
development from an unfertilised egg- After hatching, larvae may develop
through four larval stages into free-living adult male and female worms
  o s      s
However under certain conditions, possibly related to temperature and
moisture, the L3 can become parasitic, infecting the host by skin
penetration or ingestion and migrating via the venous system, the lungs
and trachea to develop into adult female worms in the small intestine. [n
then penetrating the mucosa of the rectum or perianal skin followed by a
pulmonary migration to the gut.
Puppies may  acquire  infection  immediately  after birth  from  the
mobilisation of arrested larvae in the tissues of the ventral abdominal wall
of the dam, which are subsequently excreted in the milk. The prepatent
period is 9 days.
(Portugal, France, Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary)
Pathogenesis: Severe infections can occur in dogs, especially in puppies.
Mature parasites are found in the duodenum and proximal jejunum and, if
present in large numbers, may cause inflammation with oedema and
erosion of the epithelium. This results in a catarrhal enteritis with
impairment of digestion and absorption

Clinical signs: Bloody diarrhoea, dehydration, sometimes death
Diagnosis: The clinical signs in very young animals, usually within the
first few weeks of life, together with the finding of large numbers of the
characteristic eggs or larvae in  the faeces are suggestive of
strongyloidosis.
Pathology: Lesions consist of catarrhal inflammation of the small
intestine while in severe infections there may be necrosis and sloughing of
the mucosa. Adult worms establish in tunnels in the epithelium at the base
of the villi in the small intestine.
Epidemiology: The dog may act as a natural host for this species.
Transmission is either by the oral or percutaneous route or by
autoinfection. The latter route can lead to cases of persistent
strongyloidosis occurring without external reinfection. Unweaned puppies
are infected orally from larvae adhering to the teats and with larvae
ingested with colostrum. Infection is most commonly seen in the summer
when the weather is hot and humid and is frequently a kennel problem
A strain of Strongyloides stercoralis has become adapted to man and
usually occurs in warm climates.
Treatment: In dogs, oral fenbendazole at 10-20 mg/kg daily for 3 days is
effective. Ivermectin is effective against adult worms.
892
Control: Disinfection or replacement of kennels and bedding eliminates
the sources of infection.
Notes: S. stercoralis can cause several forms of disease in man:
1. Penetration and subcutaneous migration of filariform larvae
(larval migrans) can cause an itching dermatitis that often resolves
spontaneously.
2. Migration in the mucosa of the intestinal tract can cause a chronic
intestinal syndrome. Symptoms include sporadic diarrhoea,
epigastric abdominal pain, heartburn, bloating and weight loss.
3. A mild transient pulmonary form can occasionally occur that
induces mild coughing.
4. Occasionally disseminated infection can induce neurological
manifestations, such as Gram-negative polymicrobial meningitis.
Less frequently, S. stercoralis has been associated with cerebral and
cerebellar abscesses.

Alaria alata
Common name: Intestinal carnivore fluke
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Diplostomatidae
          s 
Description, microscopic: At the anterior lateral corners of the anterior
part there are two tentacle-like processes. The suckers are very small and
the adhesive organ consists of two long folds with distinct lateral margins.
893
The eggs are large, 98-134 μm x 62-68 μm, operculate and
unembryonated.
Final hosts: Dog, cat, fox, mink, wild carnivores and rarely man
Intermediate hosts: 1. Fresh water snails (Planorbis spp). 2. Frogs and
toads.
Life cycle: Eggs are passed in the faeces from which miracidia eventually
hatch and enter fresh water snails (Planorbis). Sporocysts produce
cercariae with bifurcated tails. These leave the snail and infect tadpoles or
a frog, snake or mouse eats the tadpole, the mesocercariae become
infected by eating rodents infected with mesocercariae. Once infected the
and diaphragm, becoming metacercariae before returning to the small
intestine and maturing into flukes. The prepatent period is 1-2 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Eastern Europe
Pathogenesis: Adult fluke attach to the mucous membrane of the small
intestine (Fig. 6.7) but cause little harm. However the migratory
mesocercariae may cause clinical symptoms. Heavy infections may cause
a severe duodenitis and pulmonary damage in dogs and cats. A fatal case
the principal lesions were in the lungs.
Clinical signs: Infection is not usually associated with clinical signs.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is by identifying the presence of eggs in the faeces.
Pathology: Effects are generally limited to the attachment of flukes to the
intestinal mucosa and may include local irritation, erosion and ulceration
and the production of excessive intestinal mucus and, rarely,
haemorrhagic enteritis.
intermediate hosts are abundant. Transmammary infection has been
reported with some species in cats and rodents.
Treatment: Treatment with praziquantel or niclosamide is recommended.

Control: Dogs and cats should be prevented from catching or consuming
 paratenic hosts such as frogs, rodents and snakes.
Nanophyetus salmincola
Synonym: Trogiotrema saimincola
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Troglotrematidae
Description, gross: The fluke is small, oval, white or cream in colour,
about 1-2.5 mm long × 0.3 mm wide.
Description, microscopic: The large testes are oval and situated side by
side in the posterior third of the segment. Eggs are yellowish brown in
colour, unembryonated and measure about 64-80 × 34-50 μm. They have
an indistinct operculum and a small rounded abopercular knob.
Final hosts: Dog, cat, racoon, mink, bear, lynx, other fish-eating
mammals and rarely man
Intermediate hosts:
1.Snails(Oxytrema
silicula, Goniobasis,
Semisuicospira spp). 2. Various salmonid fish
895
Life cycle: Eggs are passed in the faeces of the host and after hatching,
which takes about 3 months, infect the snail first intermediate host. The
liberated cercariae swim for a while before penetrating a fish, encysting in
the kidneys, muscles and other organs. Infection of the final host occurs
when the fish is eaten. The prepatent period is as short as 5 days in the
aop
Geographical distribution:  North America  (northwest  Pacific) and
eastern Russia.
Pathogenesis: The trematodes penetrate deeply into the mucosa of the
duodenum or attach to the mucosa of other parts of the small or large
intestine. In large numbers they produce a superficial enteritis which may
lead to haemorrhagic enteritis. The real importance of N. saimincola lies
in its ability to transmit Neorickettsia heiminthoeca the agent of^salmon
poisoning', which frequently produces severe and fatal infections in dogs,
foxes and other animals.
Clinical signs: The presence of large numbers of flukes may cause
diarrhoea. With  complicated  infections  involving   Neorickettsia
heiminthoeca, there is a sudden onset of fever and complete loss of
appetite. Within a few days there is purulent discharge from the eyes,
vomiting and profuse diarrhoea, which may be haemorrhagic. Mortality
varies from 50-90% of infected animals.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is by identifying the presence of eggs in the faeces.

Control: Dogs and cats should not be fed raw fish and should be kept
away from salmon rivers and streams.
Notes: Nanophyetus can occasionally infect man where it penetrates
between the villi and causes inflamation and necrosis of the mucosa.
Several other trematodes parasitise the small intestine of dogs and cats and
other definitive hosts, including birds and man, but they are usually of
minor veterinary significance and are only briefly summarised in Table
6.2.
Diphyllobothrium latum
Common name:Broad tapeworm
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Diphyllobothriidae
Description, gross: A very long, ivory coloured, tapeworm, up to 20 m in
length, with several hundred proglottids. The scolex is unarmed with two
muscular longitudinal grooves or bothria as organs of attachment.
Description, microscopic: The mature and gravid segments are
long. Eggs are yellow, ovoid, operculate and measure around 70 x 50 μm.
Final hosts: Man and fish-eating mammals, such as the dog, cat, pig and
polar bear
Life cycle: Eggs are continuously discharged from the genital pores of the
attached gravid segments of the strobila and pass to the exterior in the
faeces. They resemble F. hepatica eggs being yellow and operculate, but
are approximately half the size. The eggs must develop in water and
within a few weeks each hatches to liberate a motile ciliated coracidium,
stage, a procercoid. When the copepod is ingested by a freshwater fish, the
procercoid migrates to the muscles or viscera to form the second larval
stage, the plerocercoid; this solid larval metacestode is about 5.0 mm long
898
and possesses the characteristic scolex. The life cycle is completed when
the infected fish is eaten raw, or insufficiently cooked, by the final host.
Development to patency is rapid, occurring within 4 weeks of ingestion of
the plerocercoid. However, if the infected fish is eaten by a larger fish, the
plerocercoid has the ability to establish itself in its new host.
Geographical distribution: Parts of Scandinavia, Russia, Japan and
North America
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: In man, infections are often
asymptomatic but there can be fatigue, dyspepsia, vomiting and transient
diarrhoea.  Infection is  usually asymptomatic in  animals although
occasionally vitamin B12 deficiency can occur.
Diagnosis: This depends on the detection of the characteristic eggs in the
faeces.
Pathology: Does not induce damage to the intestine.
           
hosts the cestode produces few fertile eggs. The epidemiology is therefore
largely centred around two factors, the access of human sewage to
freshwater lakes and the ingestion of uncooked fish. Domestic animals,

the maximum length being about 80 cm.
Description, microscopic: The scolex has a protrusible rostellum, which
is armed with four or five rows of small rose-thorn shaped hooks (Fig.
6.8). The proglottid is easily recognised, being elongate, like a large rice

Life cycle: The newly passed segments are active, and can crawl about on
the tail region of the animal. The oncospheres are contained in egg packets
or capsules, each with about 20 eggs, and these are either expelled by the
active segment or released by its disintegration.
abdominal cavity where they develop into cysticercoids. All stages of the
biting louse can ingest oncospheres, but the adult flea, with its mouthparts
adapted for piercing, cannot do so, and infection is only acquired during
the larval stage, which has chewing mouthparts. Development in the
louse, which is permanently parasitic and therefore enjoys a warm habitat,
takes about 30 days, but in the flea larva and the developing adult in the
cocoon, both of which are on the ground, development may extend over
several months. The final host is infected by ingestion of the flea or louse
containing the cysticercoids. Development to patency, when the first
gravid segments are shed, takes about 3 weeks.

901
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The adult is non-pathogenic and several hundreds can be
tolerated without clinical effect. They shed segments, which, as they crawl
actively from the anus, may cause some discomfort, and a useful sign of
infection is excessive grooming of the perineum. It has been suggested
that infected dogs form the habit of rubbing the anus along the floor, but
impacted anal glands are a more common cause of this behaviour.
Clinical signs: Anal discomfort, itching
Diagnosis: Often the first indication of infection is the presence of a
segment on the coat around the perineum. If the segment is freshly passed,
preliminary identification may be made on the elongate shape, and the

Pathology: Adult tapeworms are of little pathogenic significance.
dependent on the continuous presence of ectoparasites for its local
endemicity, it is more prevalent in neglected animals, though infestations
are also seen in well kept dogs and cats.
Treatment and control: In Dipylidium infection, treatment and control
must be instituted together, for it is clearly of no value to eliminate the
adult tapeworm while leaving a reservoir in the animal's ectoparasites.
Hence, administration of anthelmintics, such as nitroscanate and
praziquantel, should be accompanied by the use of insecticides. It is also
903
imperative that the animal's bedding and customary resting places should
receive attention with insecticides to eliminate the immature stages of the
flea, which are many times more numerous than the adult parasites
feeding on the dog or cat.
Notes: This is the commonest tapeworm genus of the domestic dog and
cat

Echinococcusgranulosus
Subspecies: granulosus
Subspecies: equinus
Common name: Dwarf dog tapeworm, hydatidosis
Predilection site: Anterior small intestine (final host); mainly liver and
lungs (intermediate host)
904
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: The entire cestode is only about 6.0 mm long, and is
therefore difficult to find in the freshly opened intestine. It consists of a
scolex and three or four segments, the terminal gravid one occupying
about half the length of the complete tapeworm (Fig. 6.10).
Hydatid’ cysts are large fluid-filled vesicles, 5-10 cm in diameter.
Description, microscopic: The scolex is typically taeniid and the
rostellum has two rows of hooks, varying from 30-60 in number. Each
segment has a single genital opening, with the penultimate segment
sexually mature and the last segment gravid. The genital pores alternate
irregularly. For more detailed morphology of hydatid cysts see description
of E. granulosus in Chapter 3 (Sheep and goats).

embryophore is radially striated with a six-hooked oncosphere.
Final hosts: E. granulosus granulosus: dog and many wild canids; E.
granulosus equinus: dog and red fox
Intermediate hosts: E. granulosus granulosus: domestic and wild
ruminants, man and primates, pig and lagomorphs; horses and donkeys are
resistant. E. granulosus equinus: horse and donkey
Life cycle: The prepatent period in the final host is around 40-50 days,
after which only one gravid segment is shed per week. The oncospheres
are capable of prolonged survival outside the host, being viable on the
ground for about 2 years. After ingestion by the intermediate host, the

systemic circulation and develop in other organs and tissues.
Growth of the hydatid within intermediate hosts is slow, maturity being
reached in 6-12 months. In the liver and lungs the cyst may have a
diameter of up to 20 cm, but in the rarer sites, such as the abdominal
cavity where unrestricted growth is possible, it may be very large, and
contain several litres of fluid. The cyst capsule consists of an outer

scolices are budded off. Many of these brood capsules become detached
and exist free in the hydatid fluid; collectively these and the scolices are
often referred to as ^hydatid sand'
Sometimes, complete daughter cysts are formed either inside the mother
cyst or externally; in the latter case they may be carried to other parts of
the body to form new hydatids.
Geographical distribution: E. granulosus granulosus: worldwide; E.
granulosus equinus: mainly Europe
Pathogenesis: The adult tapeworm is not pathogenic, and thousands may
be present in a dog without clinical signs. In domestic animals the hydatid
in the liver or lungs is usually tolerated without any clinical signs, and the
majority of infections are only revealed at the abattoir. Where oncospheres
have been carried in the circulation to other sites, such as the kidney,
pancreas, CNS or marrow cavity of long bones, pressure by the growing
cyst may cause a variety of clinical signs.
In contrast, when man is involved as an intermediate host, the hydatid in
both lungs may be affected causing respiratory symptoms, and if several
hydatids are present in the liver there may be gross abdominal distension.

also generally not associated with clinical signs. Human infection can
result in respiratory distress or abdominal enlargement depending on
whether the lungs or liver are infected.

Pathology: No reported pathology in the final hosts.
Epidemiology:
·E. granulosus granufosus. Only a few countries, notably Iceland
and Eire, are free from this strain of E. granufosus. It is customary
to consider the epidemiology as being based on two cycles, pastoral
and sylvatic. In the pastoral cycle the dog is always involved, being
infected by the feeding of ruminant offal containing hydatid cysts.
The domestic intermediate host will vary according to the local
the natural intermediate host, scolices from these animals being the
most highly infective for dogs. In parts of the Middle East the
camel is the main reservoir of hydatids, while in northern Europe
and northern Russia it is the reindeer. The pastoral cycle is the
primary source of hydatidosis in man, infection being by accidental
ingestion of oncospheres from the coats of dogs, or from vegetables
and other foodstuffs contaminated by dog faeces. The sylvatic cycle
occurs in wild canids and ruminants and is based on predation or
carrion feeding. It is less important as a source of human infection,

introduced to domestic dogs by the feeding of viscera of wild
ruminants.
E. granulosus equinus. Equine hydatidosis is commonest in Europe,
and in other parts of the world most cases have been recorded in
imported European horses. The strain is highly specific for the
horse and the eggs do not develop in the sheep. The domestic dog
and the red fox are the final hosts, and the cycle in countries of high
prevalence depends on access by dogs to infected equine viscera.

907
Taenia, but several drugs, notably praziquantel, are now available which
are highly effective. After treatment it is advisable to confine dogs for 48
hours to facilitate the collection and disposal of infected faeces. In man,
hydatid cysts may be excised surgically, although mebendazole,
albendazole and praziquantel therapies have been reported to be effective.
Control: This is based on the regular treatment of dogs to eliminate the
adult tapeworms and on the prevention of infection in dogs by exclusion
from their diet of animal material containing hydatids. This is achieved by
denying dogs access to abattoirs, and where possible, by proper disposal
of sheep carcases on farms. In some countries these measures have been
supported by legislation, with penalties when they are disregarded. In
countries where no specific measures for hydatid control exist, it has been

livestock intermediate hosts. The dog-sheep cycle is infective to man.
Less dominant is the *Northern’ biotype that involves the wolf-reindeer or
wolf-moose cycles and is not considered a danger to man.
Echinococcusmultilocularis
Common name: Dwarf fox tapeworm, alveolar ecchinococcosis
brain, muscles, Iymph nodes (intermediate hosts)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: E. muitilocuiaris is a very small tapeworm (2-4 mm)
and is generally similar to E. granufosus, but usually with three to five
908
segments, the terminal one measuring less than half the length of the
wholeworm.
Description, microscopic: The scolex has four suckers and possesses a
double row of large and small hooks. The third segment of the adult
tapeworm is sexually mature and the genital pores are in front of the
middle of each segment. The uterus is sac-like with no lateral sacculations
in  the terminal proglottid. Gravid segments contain around 200-300
spherical eggs. Eggs that are shed have a diameter of about 30-40 μm.
The structure of the metacestode consists of a germinative gelatinous
matrix that forms multiple compartments.
Final hosts: Wild canids (primarily foxes but in some areas coyote, wolf
and raccoon dog may be involved), domestic dog and cat, although the cat
is a less suitable host than canids.
Intermediate hosts: Mainly microtine rodents, such as voles, muskrats
and lemmings, and insectivores; some of the larger mammals, including
man, are also susceptible
cycle, although in some rural communities a synanthropic cycle occurs
with the domestic dog acting as definitive host. The intermediate host is
infected by ingestion of the oncosphere and subsequent passage, via the
circulatory system, to the liver where it develops into a multilocular or
alveolar cyst (metacestode stage). The cycle is completed when the
definitive host consumes an infected intermediate host, the mature
tapeworm developing in about 5 weeks. Adult tapeworms are relatively
short lived, about 6 months.
Geographical  distribution:  Northern  hemisphere,  including  North
America, Greenland, Scandinavia, central Europe, Russia, Middle East;
also India, China and Japan
liver as the so-called multilocular or alveolar cyst, a diffuse growth with
many compartments containing a gelatinous matrix into which the
protoscolices are budded off. Growth of the intermediate stage is invasive,
extending locally and capable of systemic metastases to other sites such as
lungs, brain, muscles and lymph nodes. These hydatids are the causative
agent of alveococcosis or alveolar echinococcosis.

intermediate host, clinical signs are dependent on the level of infection
and the location of the metacestode stages. Infection in man often presents
with few signs until the infection has markedly progressed. The slow
infiltration of organs may cause symptoms resembling those of a
slow-growing carcinoma.
Diagnosis: The sedimentation and counting technique at necropsy is the
well established method for the detec tion of intestinal E. muitilocularis in
the definitive host, although the intestinal scraping technique is also
useful. More recent research techniques include the detection of
copro-DNA by PCR and the detection of E. muitilocularis specific
Serological and PCR-based tests are available for the early detection of
infection in man.
Pathology: The adult tapeworm causes little damage in the intestine of the
definitive host.
  i       si   
parenchyma and cause cirrhosis. Expansion of alveolar echinococcus in
the liver produces aggregates of small gelatinous cysts that appear similar
to malignant neoplasia.
Epidemiology: Though E. muitilocularis has a wide distribution in the
northern hemisphere, it is essentially a parasite of tundra regions with its
greatest prevalence in the subarctic regions of Canada, Alaska and Russia.
Its basic epidemiological cycle in these regions is in the arctic fox and
wolf, and their prey, small rodents and insectivores. In North America, its
range is extending south from Canada into the United States where the red
fox and coyote act as final hosts. The cycle is therefore sylvatic, and most
with the contaminated fur of foxes and wolves. However, eating
vegetables or fruit contaminated by infected foxes seeking garden voles,
 may occasionally infect suburban man.
Over the last decade the population of red foxes has expanded in Europe
and foxes have also extended their distribution into urban and peri-urban
areas. The demonstration of an urban wildlife cycle of E. muitilocufaris in
foxes has implications for human health in areas where this parasite is
910
endemic. In addition, the expansion of the synanthropic cycle, involving
domestic dogs that prey on metacestode-infected rodents, may lead to an
increase in the prevalence of human alveolar echinococcosis. E.
multilocularis egg contamination has been predicted to be maximal where
the urban and rural habitats overlap.
Treatment: Dogs and cats can be treated with praziquantel or epsiprantel.
Treatment of domestic intermediate hosts is not advised. The invasive
growth in man simulates malignant neoplasia, and because of its
infiltrative spread in tissues and its readiness to develop metastatically,
surgery is not advisable; instead treatment with mebendazole Or
praziquantel is recommended.
Control: Because of the large sylvatic reservoir, control of E.
muitilocularis is unlikely ever to be achieved. Precautionary measures
include:
(1) The wearing of protective rubber gloves when handling fresh
skins/furs of foxes, wolves etc.
(2) The thorough washing of forest fruits and berries prior to
consumption in regions where infection is endemic.
(3) The treatment of dogs and cats with an effective cestocidal
anthelmintic.
Two further species of Echinococcus occur, E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli
These are briefly summarised below. The metacestode stages can establish
and develop in man. Intermediate hosts include rodents such as the paca
(Cuniculus paca), spiny rat (Proechimys guyannensis) and agouti
(Dasyprocta spp).
Echinococcus vogeli
Predilection site: Small intestine (final hosts); liver, lung and other
visceral organs (intermediate hosts)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: E. vogeli is a very small tapeworm (4-6 mm) and
usually has three segments, the terminal gravid segment being very long in
comparison to the rest of the tapeworm.
911
Description, microscopic: The uterus is sac-like, long and tubular in
shape. The metacestode has a polycystic structure.
Final hosts: Bush dog (Speothos venaticus) and occasionally domestic
dog. Man can be an accidental host.
Geographical distribution: Central and South America
Echinococcusoligarthrus
Predilection site: Small intestine (final hosts); viscera, musculature and
skin (intermediate hosts)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: E. oligarthrus is an extremely small tapeworm
(2.5-3.0 mm) and usually has three segments.
Description, microscopic: The uterus is sac-like in the gravid proglottid.
The metacestode is polycystic in form
Final hosts: Cougar, jaguar, ocelot and other felids; man can be an
accidental host.
Geographical distribution: Central and South America
Other details for both species are similar to those for E. muitilocularis
Spirometra mansoni
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Diphyllobothriidae
Description, gross: The adult tapeworms are very similar to
Diphyffobothrium. The plerocercoids, also called spargana, are white,
ribbon-like, crinkled and can measure around 300-400 mm.
Description, microscopic: The tapeworm possesses both a uterine and a

to that of D. latum, the procercoids being found in crustaceans, such as
Cyclops, and the plerocercoids in a wide variety of hosts. These can also
act as paratenic hosts. The plerocercoids can also transfer between
intermediatehosts.
Geographical distribution: South America and Asia
Pathogenesis and pathology: The tapeworm usually causes little effect in
the intestine of dogs and cats.
Clinical signs: Usually asymptomatic in animals
Notes:Other details are similar inmostrespects to D.latum.
Occasionally, man may become infected with plerocercoids, either
eating a plerocercoid-infected host such as a pig. This zoonosis, known as
sparganosis (Sparganum was the old name for these plerocercoids), is
characterised by the presence of larvae up to 35 mm long in the muscles
and subcutaneous tissues, particularly the periorbital area, causing oedema
and inflammation. Occasionally the spargana disintegrates into several
pieces (proliferating disease), which develop separately, and this can be
fatal.
Other species of Spirometra found in dogs and cats are detailed in Table
6.4.
Taenia hydatigena
Synonym: Taenia marginata, Cysticercus tenuicollis
Predilection site: Small intestine (final hosts); abdominal cavity, liver
(intermediate hosts)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
913
Description, gross: T. hydatigena is a large tapeworm measuring up to 5
m in length. The scolex is large and has two rows of 26 and 46 rostellar
hooks. Gravid proglottids are 12 x 6 mm and the uterus has five to ten
lateral branches.
Description, microscopic: Eggs are oval or elliptical and measure 36-39
× 34-35 μm

Final hosts: Dog, fox, weasel, stoat, polecat, wolf, hyena
Intermediate hosts: Sheep, cattle, deer, pig, horse
Life cycle: Dogs and wild canids are infested by consuming the
cysticercus in the intermediate host. The intermediate host is infected
through the ingestion of tapeworm eggs that hatch in the intestine. The
oncospheres, infective to sheep, cattle and pigs, are carried in the blood to
the surface of this organ and attach to the peritoneum. Within a further 4
weeks each develops into the characteristically large metacestode,
Cysticercustenuicoffis.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Adult tapeworms in dogs are usually
asymptomatic. However, in heavy infections there may be gastrointestinal
disturbances such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and anal pruritis that result
from the migration of proglottids from the perianal area.
Diagnosis: Often the first signs of tapeworm infection in dogs is the
as a result of the active migration of the segments.
914
Pathology: Usually causes little damage to the intestine although there
have been occasional reports of obstruction when several worm are
present.
Epidemiology: If untreated, the final host can harbour tapeworms from
several months to a year or more.
Treatment: Tapeworms can be removed from dogs through the
administration of  an  effective  cestocidal anthelmintic,  such
as
niclosamide, praziquantel, nitroscanate or multiple doses of mebendazole
or fenbendazole (Table 6.5). No practical treatment is available for the
intermediate host.

Common name: Gid, sturdy, staggers
Predilection site: Small intestine (definitive hosts); brain and spinal cord
(intermediate hosts)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: Adult tapeworms are 40-100 cm in length.
Description, microscopic: Adults have a small head about 0.8 mm in
diameter with four suckers. There is a double ring of 22-32 rostellar
hooks. The gravid segments measure 8-12 × 3-4 mm and the uterus has
18-26 lateral branches which contain taeniid eggs. Eggs are
approximately 29-37 μm in diameter.
916
Final hosts: Dog, fox, coyote, jackal and wolf
Intermediate hosts: Sheep, goat, cattle, deer, pig, horse, man
Life cycle: The intermediate host is infected through the ingestion of T.
multiceps eggs. Each egg contains an oncosphere that hatches and is
activated in the small intestine. The oncosphere then penetrates the
intestinal mucosa and is carried via the blood to the brain or spinal cord
where each oncosphere develops into the metacestode larval stage
(Coenurus cerebralis). When mature, this is readily recognised as a large
fluid-filled cyst up to 5.0 cm or more in diameter. This bears clusters of up
to several hundred scolices on its internal wall. In goats the cysts can also
mature in subcutaneous and intramuscular sites. The cysts in sheep and
goats often persist throughout the life of the animal. The life cycle is
brain or spinal cord.
New Zealand
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Infection in the intermediate hosts is
usually asymptomatic.
Diagnosis: As for T. hydatigend
Pathology: No associated pathology
Epidemiology: This is largely influenced by whether sheepdogs and stray
dogs have access to the heads or spinal cords of infected intermediate
hosts
Treatment: As for other taenid species
Control: This can be achieved through ensuring that dogs, in particular
sheep dogs, do not have access to the heads of slaughtered or dead sheep
Or goats. It is essential that all sheep carcases are buried as soon as
possible. In areas where coenurosis is endemic the regular de-worming of
dogs with an effective anthelmintic every 6-8 weeks will reduce the
may lead to eradication of the disease. Foxes are not thought to be an
important final host for T. muiticeps.
917
Taenia ovis
Synonym: Cysticercus ovis
Common name: Ovine cysticercosis, 'sheep measles
Predilection site: Small intestine (final host); muscle (intermediate host)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: The adult tapeworm is large, measuring 0.5-1.5 m in
length.
Microscopic: The rostellum bears 24-36 hooks. The strobila has a
scalloped edge and is often coiled into a spiral. The mature proglottids

uterus of the gravid proglottids has 20-25 lateral branches on either side.
Final hosts: Dog, fox, wild carnivores
Intermediate hosts: Sheep, goat
Life cycle: Dogs and wild canids are infested by consuming the
cysticercus in the intermediate host. The intermediate host is infected
through the ingestion of tapeworm eggs that hatch in the intestine. The
metacestode stage (Cysticercus ovis) infects the musculature and cysts are
usually located in the skeletal muscle, heart, diaphragm and intermuscular
connective tissue. The cyst becomes infective around 2-3 months after
infection of the host. The prepatent period in dogs is around 6-9 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Heavy infections in young dogs can
sometimes cause diarrhoea and ill-thrift.

harbouring eggs of T. ovis.
Treatment: As for other taenid species
Control: Regular treatment of dogs with an effective anthelmintic will
reduce contamination of the environment. Dogs should be denied access
to raw sheep and goat meat and carcases. A highly protective recombinant
vaccine is availableinsome countries.

919
(a)
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: The adult tapeworm can measure up to 2 m in length.
Microscopic: The adult tapeworm has a large scolex with narrow strobila
and the rostellum has 34-48 hooks (Fig. 6.11a). Gravid segments have a
920
uterus with 8-14 lateral branches on either side. Cysticercus pisiformis is a
small pea-like transparent cyst. Eggs are oval or elliptical and measure 37
× 32 μm.
Final hosts: Dog, fox
Intermediate hosts: Rabbit,hare
Life cycle: Infection of the intermediate host is through ingestion of
the intermediate host and penetrate the intestinal wall and pass via the
portal system to the liver. Juvenile stages migrate through the liver
parenchyma and locate in the abdominal cavity after 2-4 weeks, where
they develop into cysts (Cysticercus pisiformis) attached to the wall of the
mesentery and omentum. Cysts can survive the life of the host. The final
host is infected by ingesting the cysticercus. The prepatent period in the
dog is around 6-8 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infection is usually asymptomatic in both the final and the
intermediate host. However, in heavy infections liver damage can occur in
the intermediate host as a result of migration of juvenile worms through
the liver parenchyma. This can lead to hepatitis and cirrhosis.
Clinical signs: Infection is usually asymptomatic. In heavy infections the
intermediate hosts may show emaciation and jaundice
Diagnosis: Infection of the intermediate host is detected through the
presence of a single cyst or a cluster of several cysts in the abdominal
cavity.
Pathology: Pea-like cysts present on the peritoneum, wall of the
mesentery and omentum.
Epidemiology: There is a high prevalence in hunting dogs.
Treatment: As for other taenid species

Taenia serialis
Synonym: Coenurus serialis
Predilection site: small intestine (definitive host); intramuscular and
subcutaneous connective tissue (intermediate host)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: The adult tapeworm is of medium length, around
0.5-0.7 m, and bears two rows of hooks (Fig. 6.11b). The metacestode
cysts may be 4-6 cm in size.
Microscopic: The numerous scolices in the Coenurus are arranged in
lines or strands as the name ‘serialis' implies. The gravid uterus has
1 0-18 lateral branches and the vaginal sphincter is well developed.
Final hosts: Dog, fox and other canids
Intermediate hosts: Rabbit, hare and rarely rodents and man
Life cycle: Infection of the intermediate host is through ingestion of
tapeworm eggs shed by dogs. The intermediate stage Coenurus serialis is
found in the rabbit, usually subcutaneously or in the intermuscular
connective tissue. The final host is infected by ingesting the metacestode
stage.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infection is usually asymptomatic in both the definitive and
the intermediate host.
Clinical signs: No clinical signs reported.

anthelmintic and should not be fed raw carcases or offal from rabbits and
hares.
Notes: The correct nomenclature for the intermediate host stage is the
metacestode stage of Taenia serialis’ rather than ‘Coenurus serialis'.
Another species Taenia brauni is very similar to T. serialis and is found in
parts of Africa. The adult tapeworm occurs in the dog and other wild
canids and the metacestode in rodents.

Life cycle: The metacestode (Cysticercus fasciolaris) develops in the liver
of rodents and is infective to cats after about 9 weeks. When a cat ingests
the metacestode the scolex attaches to the wall of the intestine.
Tapeworms in cats become patent around 6 weeks and eggs are ingested
by the intermediate host.
Geographical distribution: Cosmopolitan
infections are usually subclinical.
Clinical signs: None reported.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis depends on the demonstration of segments or
individual taeniid eggs in the faeces. Specific identification of the adult
tapeworm is a specialised task.

contaminated with cat faeces harbouring eggs of T. taeniaeformis. Two
cycles can occur: an urban cycle that involves the domestic cat and house
924
and field rodents; and a sylvatic cycle that in North America uses bobcats
and wild rodents.
Treatment: Cats should be treated regularly with an effective cestocidal
anthelmintic. For adult tapeworms a number of effective drugs are
available, including praziquantel, mebendazole, fenbendazole and
dichlorophen.
Control: Control depends on dietary methods that exclude access to the
larval stage in the intermediate host. Where practical, cats should be
prevented from eating rodents.
Taenia cervi
Synonym: Cysticercus cervi, Taenia krabbei, Cysticercus tarandi
Predilection site: Small intestine (definitive host); muscle (intermediate
host)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Deseription, gross: The adult worm is about 26 cm long.
Description, microscopic: The mature segments are much broader than
long and the organs are compressed and transversely elongated. The
scolex bears 26-34 hooks.
Final hosts: Wolf, red fox, arctic fox
Intermediate hosts: Red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus
capreolus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)
Life cycle: Wild canids are infested by consuming the cysticercus in the
intermediate host. The intermediate host is infected through the ingestion
Of tapeworm eggs that hatch in the intestine.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Cysticerci may cause economic loss through condemnation
at meat inspection.
925
Clinical signs: Adult tapeworms are considered to be of little pathogenic
importance. Infected intermediate hosts do not usually show clinical signs
of disease.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is through the identification of cysts at postmortem.
Pathology: The mature, ovoid white cysticerci are grossly visible in the
muscle, heart, lung, liver and brain.
Epidemiology: Deer are infected by grazing pasture and forages
contaminated with carnivore faeces harbouring taenid eggs.
Treatment and control: Control is not practical.
Notes: The correct nomenclature for the intermediate host stage is the
unclear whether Taenia krabbei, found mainly in reindeer, is synonymous
with T. cervi, which is found mainly in red deer and roe deer, and that they
are one and the same species present in different hosts.
Mesocestoides lineatus
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Mesocestoididae
Description, gross: The adult tapeworm is 30250 cm in length and up to
3 mm wide.
Description, microscopic: The scolex is large and the suckers are
elongate and oval. Mature segments each contain a sinle set of
reproductive organs. The eggs are 0val and measure 40-60 × 35-43 μm.
Final host: Dog, cat, fox, mink and wild carnivores
Intermediate hosts: 1. Orabatid mites. 2. Birds, amphibians, reptiles
Life cycle: The life cycle requires two intermediate hosts. A cysticercoid
       i    
intermediate hosts forms a terathrydium; this may remain as an
encapsulated form for some time.
926
Geographical distribution: Europe, Asia, Africa
Pathogenesis: Adult tapeworms are of minor pathogenic significance and
infections are usually subclinical.
Clinical signs: None reported

Intermediate hosts: Various dung beetles and water beetles
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, but absent from certain areas, for
example parts of western Europe
For more details see Chapter 5 (Pigs).
Coccidiosis
Dogs and cats are infected with coccidian parasites belonging to the
genus, Isospora. In the dog, the common Isospora species are I. canis and
I. ohioensis. In the cat the common species are I. felis and I. rivoita.
Pathogenesis: There is no real evidence that these species are pathogenic
        o  
disease, or other immunosuppressive agents.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea in young puppies or kittens 
coccidial stages in the intestines. Affected animals with diarrhoea or
dysentery may be shedding oocysts in the faeces. The presence of oocysts
is not in itself sufficient for diagnosis but should be considered with
presenting signs of sudden onset of enteritis. Oocysts may need to be
927
differentiated from other oocysts of other coccidia genera found in dogs
(see Table 6.7) and cats (see Table 6.8 and Fig. 6.12).
Pathology: Coccidial stages are found in the epithelial cells lining the villi
of the small intestine. In heavy infections there is villous stunting and
reduction in the absorptive area of the lower small intestine leading to
diarrhoea.
Epidemiology: Crowding and lack of good sanitation promote spread of
coccidiosis.
. Breeding establishments,
kennels andrescuecentres are
potential sources of infection. Older dogs and cats are generally immune
to
infection in young puppies and kittens that have no previous exposure
Treatment: Information on treatment in the dog and cat is scanty,
although by analogy with other host species, the use of sulphonamides,
such as sulphadimidine, should be tried.

Description: Oocysts are 13 x 11 μm without a micropyle or residuum
Stieda body but have a residuum.
Final hosts: Dog
Intermediate hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, rodents, guinea pig
Life cycle: Unsporulated oocysts are produced in the faeces, and
following infection of the intermediate hosts, the multiplication of
tachyzoites in the lamina propria of the intestinal wall is followed by the
production of cysts containing bradyzoites in the skeletal muscle. The
prepatent period is 6-7 days. Sporulation time is 3 days.
Geographical distribution: Presumed worldwide
Pathogenesis: Non-pathogenic
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea in young puppies
Diagnosis: Identification of oocysts in dog faeces and differentiation from
other coccidia species of dogs (see T'able 6.7)
932
Pathology: Not reported
Epidemiology: The dog is infected following the consumption of
zoite-containing tissues of the intermediate host. Direct dog-to-dog
transmission does not occur.
Treatment: Not indicated
Control: The only control measures possible are those of simple hygiene
Dogs should also not be fed raw or uncooked meat.
Hammondia hammondi

Description: Unsporulated oocysts are colourless, spherical
to
subspherical to ellipsoidal, 13-14 × 10-11 μm (mean 13 × 11 μm) after
sporulation. The sporocysts are ellipsoidal, 8-11 x 6-8 μm (mean 10x 6.5
 μm) and have no Stieda body but have a residuum. The sporozoites are
elongate and curved with a nucleus near the centre.
Final hosts: Cat
Intermediate hosts: Rodents (mouse, rat, guinea pig)
Life cycle: The cat is infected by ingesting the infected rodents containing
meronts. After ingestion, there is multiplication in the small intestine
epithelium followed by gametogony. The prepatent period in the cat is
5-16 days and the patent period can be as long as 136 days.
Geographical distribution: Presumed worldwide
Pathogenesis: Non-pathogenic to either host, but it is important to
recognise that the oocysts of Hammondia closely resemble those of
Toxoplas ma and that their differentiation in cat faeces is a specialist task.
Clinical signs: No associated clinical signs

Sarcocystis
The previously complex nomenclature for the large number of Sarcocystis
spp has largely been discarded by many workers in favour of a new
to systematists, this practice has the virtue of simplicity.
At present the most important species recognised with the dog as a final
host are:
·Sarcocystis bovicanis (Sarcocystis cruzi)
·Sarcocystis ovicanis (Sarcocystis tenella)
·Sarcocystis capricanis
·Sarcocystishircicanis
·Sarcocystis
suicanis
(Sarcocystis
Sporcicanis,Sarcocystis
miescheriana)
·Sarcocystis equicanis (Sarcocystis bertrami)
·Sarcocystis fayeri
·Sarcocystis hovarthi
·Sarcocystis cameli
The most important species recognised with the cat as a final host are:
·Sarcocystis bovifelis (syn S. hirsuta)
·Sarcocystis ovifelis (S. tenella, S. medusiformis)
·Sarcocystis porcifelis (Sarcocystis suifelis)
934
Life cycle: The life cycle for all species is heteroxenous. Sexual stages
dog and cat is by ingestion of bradyzoite cysts in the muscles of infected
intermediate hosts. The bradyzoites are liberated in the intestine and the
micro- and macrogametocytes. Following conjugation of gametes,
thin-walled oocysts are formed which, unlike those of most other enteric
sporozoans, sporulate within the body. Two sporocysts are formed, each
containing four sporozoites. Usually the fragile oocyst wall ruptures and
free sporocysts are found in the faeces.
Pathogenesis: Infection in the dog and cat is normally non-pathogenic
although mild diarrhoea has occasionally been reported with some
infections.
Clinical signs: Occasional diarrhoea
differentiation from other coccidia species of dogs and cats (see Tables 6.7
and 6.8)
Pathology: Infection in the final host is not normally associated with
pathological changes. Oocysts may be seen in the lamina propria and
within the epithelium at the tips of the villi.
Epidemiology: Little is known of the epidemiology, but from the high
 prevalence of symptomless infections observed in abattoirs, it is clear that
where dogs and cats are kept in close association with farm animals or
their feed, then transmission is likely. Sheep dogs and farm cats are known
to play an important part in the transmission of Sarcocystis and care
should be exercised that only cooked meat is fed to dogs and cats. Acute
outbreaks of Sarcocystis in livestock are probably most likely when
livestock, which have been reared without contact with farm dogs
particularly, are subsequently exposed to large numbers of the sporocysts
from dog faeces. The longevity of the sporocysts shed in the faeces is not
known.
Treatment and control: There is no effective treatment for infection in
dogs or cats. The only control measures possible are those of simple
hygiene. Farm dogs and cats should not be housed in, or allowed access
to, fodder stores, nor should they be allowed to defecate in pens where
935
livestock are housed. It is also important that they are not fed uncooked
meat.

Geographical distribution: Thought to be worldwide
Life cycle: The life cycle of all Cryptosporidium species is basically
similar to that of other intestinal coccidia although sporulation takes place
within the host. Oocysts, each with four sporozoites, are liberated in the
faeces. Following ingestion, the sporozoites invade the microvillous brush
border of the enterocytes and the trophozoites rapidly differentiate to form
meronts with four to eight merozoites. Gametogony follows, after one to

Giardiaintestinalis
Synonym:Giardiaduodenalis,Giardialamblia,Lamblialamblia
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Diplomonadidae
Description: The trophozoite has a pyriform to ellipsoidal, bilaterally
symmetrical body, 12-15 × 5-9 μm. The dorsal side is convex and there is
a large sucking disk on the ventral side. There are two anterior nuclei, two
slender axostyles, eight flagellae in four pairs and a pair of darkly staining
median bodies. The median bodies are curved bars resembling the claws
of a hammer. Cysts are ovoid, 8-12 x 7-10 μm and contain four nuclei.
Hosts: Man, cattle, sheep, goat, pig, alpaca, dog, cat, guinea pig,
chinchilla
Life cycle: The life cycle is simple and direct, the trophozoite stage
dividing by binary fission to produce further trophozoites. Intermittently,
trophozoites encyst forming resistant cyst stages that pass out in the faeces
of the host in the faeces.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Although Giardia cysts are commonly excreted in the
faeces of dogs and cats there is no consistent relationship with diarrhoea
or other signs of gastrointestinal problems, although they could act as
reservoirs of infection for humans.
Clinical signs: When disease does occur, the signs often include chronic,
pasty diarrhoea, weight loss, lethargy and failure to thrive.
Diagnosis: Giardia cysts can be detected in faeces by a number of
methods. Traditional methods of identification involve direct examination
of faecal smears, or faecal concentration by formalin-ethyl acetate or zinc
945
sulphate methods and subsequent microscopic examination. It is generally
recommended that three consecutive samples be examined as cysts are
excreted intermittently.
Pathology: There may be villous atrophy, crypt hypertrophy and an
 rq ae  s   a   aq 
of epithelial cells
Epidemiology: Molecular studies have revealed a substantial level of
genetic diversity in G. intestinalis isolates. Human isolates fall into two
major groups (assemblage A and B) with a wide host range in other
mammals and it may prove to be the case that separate species names may
be applicable. Other assemblages may also represent distinct species.
Limited epidemiological studies suggest that in animal isolates, direct
animal-to-animal contact and faecal soiling are the most likely methods of
transmission, although water contamination can also be considered as a
possible route. Zoonotic transmission has been reported from dogs.
Treatment and control: Several benzimidazole anthelmintics (e.g-
albendazole, fenbendazole) and nitroimidazole drugs (metronidazole,
tinidazole) are effective and may prove to be of benefit in the treatment of
Giardia infections in animals. As infectionis transmittedby the
faecal-oral route, good hygiene and prevention of faecal contamination of
feed and water are essential.
Notes: The parasite is important because of water-borne outbreaks that
have occurred in human populations. There is still controversy over the
classification of Giardia spp. The current molecular classification places
isolates into eight distinct assemblages. Some authors give separate
specific names to organisms isolated from different hosts, although
species specificity of many isolates is unknown. Phylogenetic data suggest
that G. intestinalis is a species complex composed of several species that
are host specific.
LARGEINTESTINE
Trichuris vulpis
Synonym: Trichocephalus vulpis
946
Common name: Whipworms
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: The adults are whitish and about 4.5-7.5 cm long
with a thick broad posterior end tapering rapidly to a long filamentous
anterior end that is characteristically embedded in the mucosa (Fig. 6. 15).
Description, microscopic: The male tail is coiled and possesses a single
spicule in a protrusible sheath. The sheath bears small spines only on its
 t x  s   s    m
with a thick smooth shell and conspicuous polar plug at both ends; in the
faeces these eggs appear yellow or brown in colour.
Fig. 6.15 Trichuris vuipis adults recovered from an infected intestine.
Hosts: Dog, fox, cat
Life cycle: The infective stage is the L1 within the egg, which develops in
1 or 2 months of being passed in the faeces depending on the temperature.
Under optimal conditions, these may subsequently survive and remain
viable for several years. After ingestion, the plugs are digested and the
released L1 penetrate the glands of the distal ileum, caecal and colonic
947
mucosa. Subsequently, all four moults occur within these glands, the
adults emerging to lie on the mucosal surface with their anterior ends
embedded in the mucosa. The prepatent period is around 3 months.
Geographical distribution: Many parts of the world
Pathogenesis: Most infections are light and asymptomatic. Occasionally.
when large numbers of worms are present, they cause a haemorrhagic
colitis and/or a diphtheritic inflammation of the caecal mucosa. This
results from the subepithelial location and continuous movement of the
anterior end to the whipworm as it searches for blood and fluid.
Clinical signs: Sporadic disease due to heavy infection is more common
in dogs and is associated with an acute or chronic inflammation of the
caecal mucosa with watery diarrhoea that often contains blood. Anaemia
may be present and animals can lose weight.
Diagnosis: Since the clinical signs are not pathognomonic, diagnosis may
depend on finding numbers of lemon-shaped Trichuris eggs in the faeces.
Egg output is often low in Trichuris infections. However, since clinical
necropsy or a favourable response to anthelmintic treatment. Occasionally
expelled adult worms may be present in faeces.
Pathology: In severe cases, the mucosa of the large intestine is inflamed
Epidemiology: The most important feature is the longevity of the eggs.
Older dogs tend to have higher whipworm burdens than young dogs.
Treatment: The probenzimidazoles and benzimidazoles, administered
over several days, are effective against adult Trichuris, but less so against
the larval stage. Milbemycins are effective.
Control: Prophylaxis is rarely necessary. Attention should be given to
areas where eggs might continue to survive for long periods. Such areas
should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected or sterilised by wet or dry
heat.
Notes: The adults are usually found in the caecum but are only
occasionally present in sufficient numbers to be clinically significant.
948
Two other species, Trichuris serrata and Trichuris campanula,are
occasionally found in the cat, mainly in North and South America and the
Caribbean. Details on the life cycle, pathogenesis, treatment and control
are essentially similar to those for T. vuipis.

Description: Trophozoites of the large form are 20-30 μm in diameter.
those of the small form are 12-15 μm. The nucleus, when stained, has a
small central endostome with a ring of small peripheral granules. The
cysts of both forms are 10-12 μm in size, contain four nuclei when mature
and often contain rod-like chromatin bodies with rounded ends.
Hosts: Man, dog, cat, pig, rat, monkey
Life cycle: E. histolytica multiplies by binary fission, but eventually
encysts and cysts are passed in the faeces. Cysts contain four nuclei and
and both the nuclei and cytoplasm divide resulting in eight small amoebae
from each cyst.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Two forms of the parasite exist. Non-pathogenic forms of
the organism normally live in the lumen of the large intestine. Pathogenic
forms invade the mucosa causing ulceration and dysentery. From there
they may be carried via the portal system to the liver and other organs
proteolytic enzymes and produce characteristic flaskshaped ulcers in the
mucosa of the large intestine. Their erosion may allow the parasites to
enter the bloodstream when the most common sequel is the formation of
amoebic abscesses in the liver. The veterinary significance of amoebosis
is that natural infections, usually without clinical signs, can occur
infections. Kittens are also susceptible to experimental infection, although

they do not produce cysts. Monkeys have their own strains of E.
histolytica and these can be infective to man.
Clinical signs: Infection causes diarrhoea or dysentery.

A number of serological tests have been evaluated for the diagnosis of E.
histolytica infections. These include ELISA, latex agglutination,
complement fixation  and  indirect  haemagglutination.  A number  of

of specific DNA sequences that correlate to the pathogenic/
non-pathogenic isoenzyme analysis categorisation and appear to be very
sensitive and specific.
Pathology: Pathogenic strains of amoebae penetrate the mucosa of the
large intestine and multiply to form small colonies that extend into the
submucosa and muscularis. In the absence of bacterial infection there is
little reaction, but in complicated infections there is hyperaemia and
inflammation with predominantly neutrophils. Amoebae may pass into the

Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite subphylum: Sarcodina
Family: Trichomonadidae
Description: The body is pyriform, 8-20 μm long and there are usually
five anterior flagella. Four of the anterior flagella are grouped together,
and the fifth is separate and directed posteriorly. A sixth flagella runs
along the undulating membrane and extends beyond the body as a free
trailing flagellum. The undulating membrane extends the length of the
body. The axostyle is thick, hyaline with a sharply pointed tip. The pelta is
crescent shaped.
Hosts: Man, monkey, dog, cat, rat, mouse, hamster, guinea pig

PARASITESOF THE
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Two species of the genus, Mammomonogamus, which is closely related to
Syngamus, are parasitic in the nasal cavities of cats. Infections are usually
asymptomatic but affected animals may sneeze and have a nasal discharge
due to irritation of the nasal mucosa. Adult worms are red in colour, 1-2
cm long and permanently joined in copula. Diagnosis is based on clinical

Capillaria aerophila
Synonym: Eucoleus aerophila
Common name: Tracheal worm
Predilection site: Trachea, bronchi, occasionally nasal passages and
frontal sinuses
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: These are very fine whitish, filamentous worms, the
narrow stichosome oesophagus occupying about one third to half the body
length. Males measure around 24 mm and females 32 mm.
952
Description, microscopic: The males have a long thin single spicule and
often possess a primitive bursa-like structure. The females contain eggs
that resemble those of Trichuris in possessing bipolar plugs. The eggs are
barrel-shaped and colourless, 59-80 × 30-40 μm and have thick shells that
are slightly striated with bipolar plugs.
Final hosts: Fox, particularly those reared on fur farms, and mustelids;
occasionally dogs, cats and man.
Intermediate hosts: Earthworms
Life cyele: The parasite can have both a direct and an indirect life cycle.
The females deposit eggs in the lungs and these are coughed up,
swallowed and pass out in the faeces onto soil. These eggs take around
5-6 weeks to reach the infective stage and can survive for months in the
environment. In the direct cycle, following ingestion of the embryonated
eggs, the larvae hatch and penetrate the small intestine and migrate via the
lymphatics and bloodstream to the respiratory passages where they invade

hatch and the larvae are infective. The final host is infected following
consumption of the earthworm. The prepatent period is around 6 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide.
Pathogenesis: The nematode causes irritation to the respiratory mucosa
with a resultant increase in secretion. There may be some constriction of
the lumen of the air passages and some areas may show emphysema.
Heavy infections can induce bronchopneumonia with occasional abscess
formation in the lung tissue. Secondary bacterial infection can sometimes
Clinical signs: Light infections are usually asymptomatic. The clinical
signs of moderate to severe infection are those of rhinotracheitis and/or
bronchitis and in this respect are similar to those caused by Osferus or
Crenosoma infection. In such cases, there may be a nasal discharge, a
wheezing cough and/or sneezing. Dyspnoea can be observed in heavy
infections.
Diagnosis: The presence of eggs in faeces and a nasal discharge are
indicative of infection. Note that the eggs are morphologically similar to
those of Capillaria plica (see under Parasites of the reproductive/
urogenital system).

consumption of infective earthworms, the major route of transmission is
usually via the ingestion of embryonated infective eggs. C. aerophila is
particularly a problem in farmed animals reared for their fur. Disease is
usually seen in foxes of less than 18 months of age.
Treatment:  Modern benzimidazoles or  ivermection are effective.
Levamisole at 7.5 mg/kg on two consecutive days and repeating 14 days
later is also effective.
Control: On fox-rearing farms, care should be taken to ensure that runs
are created in areas where the soil is dry and free-draining. Alternatively,
the animals should be housed in cages raised above the soil. Breeding
pens need to be cleaned thoroughly to reduce the accumulation of
infective eggs. Periodic treatment with anthelmintic is essential.

final host, the L3 are released by digestion and travel to the lungs, via the
lymphatic glands and hepatic circulation, where both parasitic moults take
place. The prepatent period is around 3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The spiny cuticular folds abrade the mucosa of the air
passages with resulting bronchopneumonia and occlusion of the smaller
bronchi and bronchioles
Clinical signs: The symptoms are those of a chronic respiratory infection,
with coughing, sneezing and nasal discharge associated with tachypnoea.
Farmed foxes may become emaciated, with fur of poor quality. In the
infrequent acute infections there may be high mortality.
Diagnosis: Examination of faeces by smear, flotation or Baerman
technique will reveal the L1 with a straight tail which differentiates it in
fresh  canine  faeces  from  those  of Osierus, Filaroides  and

Oslerus osleri
Synonym: Filaroides osleri
Common name: Dog lungworm
Predilection site: Bronchli
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Metastrongyloidea
Description, gross: Small, pale, slender worms, up to 15 mm long; males
are 5 mm, and females 9-15 mm long.
Description, microscopic: The tail of the male is rounded and bears a few
papillae; spicules are short and slightly unequal. The larva has a short
S-shaped tail.
Hosts: Dog
Life cycle: Oslerus, and its closely related genus, Filaroides, are

trachea. Many larvae are coughed up and swallowed, and passed in the
newly hatched L1, which are present in her sputum. After ingestion, the
first moult occurs in the small intestine and the L2 travel to the lungs by
the lymphatic-vascular route. Development through to L5 takes place in
the alveoli and bronchi, and the adults migrate to their predilection site,
the tracheal bifurcation. The prepatent period varies from 10-18 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The worms are embedded in fibrous nodules (2-20 mm) in
the trachea at the region of bifurcation, and in the adjacent bronchi (Fig.
6.16). Rarely found deeper in the lungs. The nodules in which the worms
956
live first appear at about two months from infection. They are
pinkish-grey granulomas, and the small worms may be seen partly
 protruding from their surfaces. These nodules are fibrous in character and

diameter. Though the majority occur near the tracheal bifurcation a few
may be found several centimetres from this area. Infection can cause
chronic tracheobronchitis.
Fig. 6.16 Fibrous nodules in the bronchus caused by infection with
Osierusosieri.
Clinical signs: Many infections are clinically inapparent, and the
characteristic nodules are only discovered incidentally at necropsy. The
major signs of Oslerus infection are respiratory distress and a dry rasping
persistent cough, especially after exercise. The most severe cases have
usually been seen in dogs of 6-12 months old, and obviously the infection
is of greater importance in working dogs. Heavy chronic infections can
impair appetite and lead to emaciation. In household pets, whose exercise
is limited, the presence of the tracheal nodules is well tolerated, and
animals show little respiratory distress.

Diagnosis: Swabs of pharyngeal mucus give variable results and repeated
sampling may be necessary. However, in paroxysmal coughing, large

of larvae. Less rewarding techniques are those based on faecal
examination, either by flotation or by the Baerman method. Although
requiring general anaesthesia, bronchoscopy is the most reliable method,
as it will indicate not only the presence, size and location of many of the
nodules, but will also allow the collection of tracheal mucus for
confirmatory examination for eggs and larvae; the latter are invariably
coiled, sluggish and have an S-shaped tail. Large nodules may be detected
by lateral thoracic radiography.
Pathology: Typical lesions are protruding submucosal nodules, greyish
white in colour, in the region of the tracheal bifurcation. Lesions vary in
size from barely visible to larger nodules or protruding plaques that
project over l cm into the lumen of the trachea. Smaller nodules contain
immature worms, and the larger ones a mass of tightly coiled adults. The
worms lie in tissue spaces between the cartilage rings of the trachea and
lymphocytic infiltration locally. Superficially the nodules are covered by
intact epithelium, except for small pores through which the female worms

reaction with neutrophils and a few giant cells.
Epidemiology: Transmission occurs when an infected bitch licks the pups
and transfers the newly hatched L1 present in the sputum. Though Osierus
has been recorded from many countries there is little data on its local
prevalence. In the UK, one survey has given a figure of 6% for all types of
dog. In further surveys in the same area, greyhounds have shown a
prevalence rate of 18%, but there is no evidence of breed susceptibility. In
general the focus of infection appears to be the nursing bitch. Infection
rates may be high in kennel-housed dogs.
Treatment: There are reports of amelioration of clinical signs, apparently
due to a reduction in the size of the nodules, after prolonged treatment
with some benzimidazoles. Fenbendazole and albendazole at increased
Control: This is difficult unless infected bitches can be identified and
treated before whelping and during lactation. In the past the only certain
958
method of control was the removal of pups from infected dams at birth,
and hand rearing or fostering on uninfected bitches.
Notes: This genus was, until recently, part of the larger genus Filaroides,
but has now been separated on morphological grounds from the other
members. Though distinction has been made on morphology it is also
useful from the veterinary standpoint, for it separates the single harmful
species, Oslerus osleri, living in the upper air passages, from the relatively
harmless species which are retained in the genus Filaroides, and which
live in the lung parenchyma.

tissue. F. hirthi is smaller than F. milksi (see later).
Description, microscopic: The L1, present in the faeces and sputum, is
coiled, and the tail has a notch, followed by a constriction, and has a
terminal lance-like point.
Hosts: Domestic dog, wild carnivores
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. The worms are ovo-viviparous and the
hatched L1 are passed in faeces or expelled in sputum. Though infection
may be acquired by ingestion of faecal larvae, the important route, as in
Oslerus infection, is thought to be by transfer of L1 in the bitch's saliva
when the pup is licked. The prepatent period of F. hirthi is 5 weeks.
Geographical distribution: North America, Europe and Japan
Pathogenesis: Infection is almost invariably asymptomatic, and is
discovered only at postmortem examination. However, in the rare heavy
infection, hyperpnoea may occur.
959
Diagnosis: A squeeze preparation from a cut surface of the lung will show
worm fragments, eggs and larvae, and this, with the host and site, is
sufficient for generic diagnosis. Only F. hirthi has been diagnosed in the
live animal and this was in experimental dogs. The L1, present in the
faeces and sputum, is coiled, and the tail has a notch, followed by a
constriction, and has a terminal lance-like point. Zinc sulphate is an
effective flotation solution for the detection of larvae.
Pathology: The chief lesions are the small, soft, greyish miliary nodules
which are associated with the presence of worms and which are
distributed sub-pleurally and throughout the lung parenchyma; in heavy
infections, sometimes observed in experimental dogs subjected to
immunosuppressive drugs, the nodules may coalesce into greyish masses.
Epidemiology: Little is known of the epidemiology. F. hirthi was first
fair to suggest, in view of its mode of transmission, that a high prevalence
Treatment: Albendazole has been reported to be effective although
treatment is rarely called for.
Control: Unlikely to be required.

Aelurostrongylus abstrusus
Common name: Cat lungworm
Predilection site: Lung parenchyma and small bronchioles
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Metastrongyloidea
Description, gross: Aggregations of worms, eggs and larvae are present
throughout the lung tissue. The worms, about 0.5-1.0 cm long, are very
slender and delicate, and are difficult to recover intact for examination.
Description, microscopic: The male bursa is short and the lobes are
indistinct. Eggs measure 80 × 70 μm; L1 in faeces bear a sub-terminal
spine on their S-shaped tail.
Final host: Cat
Intermediate hosts: Many terrestrial molluscs, such as snails and slugs;
paratenic hosts include rodents, birds, amphibians and reptiles.
Life cycle: The life cycle is indirect. The worms are ovo-viviparous, and
the L1 are passed in the faeces. These penetrate the foot of the molluscan
intermediate host and develop to the infective L3 and during this phase
paratenic hosts, such as birds and rodents, may eat the mollusc. The cat is
usually infected by ingestion of these paratenic hosts and less frequently
by ingestion of the intermediate hosts. The L3 released in the alimentary
961
tract, travel to the lungs by the lymphatics or bloodstream. After the final
moult the adults are locatedin the alveolar ducts and the terminal
bronchioles. The prepatent period is between 4 and 6 weeks, and the
duration of patency is about 4 months, though some worms may survive in
the lungs for several years despite the absence of larvae in the faeces
Geographical distribution: Presumed worldwide
majority of infections are discovered only incidentally at postmortem
examination as multiple small, greyish foci or bigger consolidated
granulomas in the lungs.
Clinical signs: The clinical effects are slight, and in the resting cat are
limited to a chronic mild cough. Following exercise or handling, there
may be coughing, sneezing and nasal discharge with slight dyspnoea and
production of mucoid sputum. In heavy experimental infections the most
severe signs have appeared at 6-12 weeks after infection when egg laying
is maximal. Heavy infections may be accompanied by diarrhoea and
weightloss.
        
technique may be necessary to find the characteristic L1, which bears a
sub-terminal spine on its S-shaped tail. Examination of pharyngeal swabs
from a cut surface of the lung will often show the worm material including
the characteristic L1. Radiography has revealed the increased vascular and
focal parenchymal densities, which would be expected from the changes
described above.
subpleural foci with greyish centres containing the worms and tissue
debris, but in the rare severe infections larger nodules are present, up to
1.0 cm in diameter with caseous centres, projecting from the lung surface;
these  nodules maycoalesce  to  formareas of  consolidation.
Microscopically the alveoli may be blocked with worms, eggs, larvae and
cellular aggregations, which may progress to granuloma formation. A
characteristic change is muscular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which
affects not only the bronchioles and alveolar ducts, but also the media of
the pulmonary arteries. In these heavy infections the pleural cavity can be
filled with a whitish fluid and occasionally fatalities have been reported.
962
With the exception of the muscular changes, which appear to be
irreversible, resolution is rapid and the lungs appear almost completely
normal within 6 months of experimental infection, though a few worms
may still be present.
Epidemiology: Aelurostrongy/us infection is widespread, partly because it
is almost indiscriminate in its ability to develop in slugs and snails, and
partly because of its wide range of paratenic hosts. So far all surveys have
shown prevalences greater than 5%
Treatment: Fenbendazole at 50 mg/kg daily for 3 days has proved
effective.
Control: In household pets, and especially those of a nomadic disposition
or living in rural locations, access to the intermediate and paratenic hosts
is difficult to prevent and control is not often easy or practical.
Notes: Other nematodes can invade the lungs of cats, but generally they
are considered to be of low pathogenicity.
Paragonimus westermani
Common name: Oriental lung fluke
Predilection site: Lung
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Troglotrematidae
Description, gross: The parasite is rounded and thick, reddish brown in
colour 7.5-16 × 4-8 mm, and covered in scale-like spines. The ventral
sucker is situated slightly anterior to the middle of the fluke.
Description, microscopic: Species differentiation is based on the shape of
the spines. Those in P. westermani are large and have bifid points. Eggs
are yellowish brown in colour, operculate, 75-118 × 42-67 μm and the
triploid flukes occur in the Far East.
Hosts: Dog, cat, pig, goat, cattle, fox, other carnivores and man
963
Life cycle: The life cycle involves an amphibious or water snail, and a
crayfish or fresh water crab. Snails of the genera Melania, Ampullaria or
Pomatiopsis are infected by miracidia in which further development
through sporocyst, redia and cerceria takes place. After escaping the snail,
the cercariae swim about and, on contact with a freshwater crab or
          
cercaria-infected snails. Infection of the final host occurs by ingestion of
also be aquired through consumpion of paratenic hosts which have eaten
infected crabs or crayfish. The young flukes migrate to the lungs where
they are encapsulated by fibrous cysts connected by fistulae to the
bronchioles to facilitate egg excretion. Eggs pass up from the lung in the
sputum which the animals usually swallow such that eggs are passed in
the faeces. The prepatent period is 5-6 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Asia
Pathogenesis: Parasites in the lungs are not usually of great importance,
 p sop o s     sis  
veterinary interest is in the potential reservoir of infection for man.
Extrapulmonary infections may produce a cutaneous larval migrans and
          
involvement may lead to seizures, paraplegia and occasional deaths.
Clinical signs: In lung infections there may be a cough and eggs may be
found in the sputum in large numbers.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is by identifying the presence of eggs in the sputum
or faeces.
Pathology: In the lungs the parasitic cyst is surrounded by diffuse
connective tissue and the cyst wall becomes infiltrated by leucocytes and
   ssd  s   s
purulent fluid mixed with blood and eggs. Pleural adhesions sometimes
occur and there is usually hyperplasia of the bronchial epithelium and
focal areas of inflammation in the lungparenchyma.
Epidemiology:  Infection is  maintained in  endemic areas  where
intermediate hosts are abundant.
964
Treatment: High doses of albendazole, fenbendazole or niclofolan over a
prolonged period can be effective in control.
Control: The complex life cycle makes control in endemic areas
impossible.
Paragonimus kellicotti
Common name: Lung fluke
Predilection site: Lung
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Troglotrematidae
Description, gross: The parasite is rounded, reddish brown in colour,
7.5-16 x 4-8 mm and covered in scale-like spines. The ventral sucker is
situated slightly anterior to the middle of the fluke.
Description, microscopic: Species differentiation is based on the shape of
the spines. Those in P. kellicotti are very large and have a number of
points. Eggs are golden-brown in colour, 80-118 × 48-60 μm and have a
partly flattened operculum.
Hosts: Cat, pig, dog

Pneumonyssus caninum
Common name: Nasal mite
Predilection site: Nasal cavity, sinuses
Parasite class: Arachnida
Parasite sub-class: Acari
965
Family: Halarachnidae
Description: The mites are oval and pale yellow, adults measuring
approximately1-1.5× 0.6-0.9mm.Theyhave a smoothcuticlewith
relatively few setae. The mites have a single irregularly shaped dorsal
plate and a small sternal plate. Genital plates are absent in this species and
the genital opening is a transverse slit between the coxae of the fourth pair
of legs. They have long legs, relative to their body size, which terminate in
claws, short pre-tarsi (though these are relatively longer on the first pair of
legs) and small suckers.
Hosts: Dog
Life cycle: The details on the life history of these mites is not fully
known. There appear to be two main life stages, the adult and a six-legged

shaking and “inverted’ sneezing, as well as with chronic rhinitis, sinusitis
and tonsillitis, although the majority of infections seem to be sub-clinical.
In working and hunting dogs the most obvious result of nasal mite
infection is a markedly impaired sense of smell. There is evidence that P.
caninum can penetrate host tissues and move beyond the respiratory
system to cause lesions in the liver and kidney.
Clinical signs: The presence of mites causes excessive nasal secretion and
hyperaemia of the nasal mucosa. Extreme infestations may result in
listlessness, loss of appetite, irritation and scratching at the eyes, chronic
sneezing, bronchial cough and rhinitis or sinusitis.
Diagnosis: The mites can be seen crawling over the tissue surface of the
examination.
Epidemiology: The infection is probably transmitted by direct
nose-to-nose contact betweenanimals.lhis species appears tobe

Linguatula serrata
Common name: Tongue worm
Predilection site: Nasal cavity, sinuses
Parasite class: Pentastomida
Family: Linguatulidae
Description: Males measure up to 20 mm in length while females are
30-130 mm in length. Both sexes are transversely striated, expanded
anteriorly and shaped like an elongated tongue (see Fig 1 .45). Anteriorly
there are five small protuberances, one bearing a small mouth at its
extremity, the others bearing tiny claws. The eggs measure about 90 × 70
μm. The larval stage is up to 500 μm in size and devoid of annulations and
mouthparts.
Hosts: Principal hosts are tropical reptiles, such as snakes and crocodiles.
but some species parasitise mammals and birds. Linguatula serrata occurs
in dogs, cats and foxes, the adult occurring in the nasal passages and
sinuses.
Life cyele: With most pentastomids the life cycle requires an intermediate
host. In the case of Linguatula serrata, eggs are expelled from the
respiratory passage of the host by coughing or sneezing. Eggs are ingested
by the herbivorous intermediate host, commonly sheep or cattle or rabbits,
and pass into the gut where they hatch. The larva bores through the
intestinal wall to the mesenteric glands, liver and lungs. Here, larval

mm in diameter, may be visible in cut surfaces of mesenteric glands. The
final host is infected by eating uncooked viscera. Following ingestion, the
nymph migrates to the nasal passages where the final moult, mating and
egg production occur.
967
Geographical distribution: Worldwide: North America, Europe and
Australia
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Infrequently, heavy infections in dogs
may cause sneezing, coughing and a nasal discharge. The parasites live for
about 15 months in the host, after which the animal usually recovers

Pneumocystis carinii
Synonym: Pneumocystis jiroveci
Common name: Pneumocystosis
Predilection site: Lung
Parasite class: Archiascomycetes
Family: Pneumocystidaceae
Description: Two major forms of P. carinii have been consistently
identified from histological and ultra-structural analysis of organisms
found in human and rat lung. These are a trophic form and a larger cyst
stage containing eight intrac ystic stages.
Hosts: Man, cattle, rat, ferret, mouse, dog, horse, pig and rabbit
Life cycle: The life cycle of Pneumocystis still remains poorly
ultrastructural analysis of the lung tissue of rodents and infected humans.
The presumed life cycle of Pneumocystis includes an asexual and a sexual
growth phase. Current knowledge suggests that the trophic (trophozoite)
forms are produced during asexual development. These forms are usually
pleomorphic and found in clusters. They appear capable of replicating
  s  oe  s   
producing a diploid zygote; this undergoes meiosis and subsequent
968
mitosis, resulting in the formation of a precyst initially, and then an early
cyst and a mature cyst eventually. During differentiation of the organism
from precyst to mature cyst, eight intracystic spores or ^daughter cells’ are
produced. These intracystic spores are subsequently released, as the
mature cyst ruptures, and develop into trophic forms.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Pneumocystis is one of the major causes of opportunistic
immunodeficiencies, retrovirus infections such as AIDS, and cases
receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
Clinical signs: Not reported in dogs
Diagnosis: Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) and Giemsa stain may
(TBO) is the most effective for cyst stages while Giemsa stains are used to
show trophozoites.
Axenic culture methods have been described; however, in vitro
cultivation, especially from clinical samples, is not always successful.
and trophozoite stages of P. carinii. A number of PCRs have been
reported which amplify specific regions of DNA from P. carinii and are
approximately 100 times more sensitive than conventional staining
techniques.
Pathology: The lesion is characterised by a massive plasma cell or
histiocyte infiltration of the alveoli in which the organisms may be
detected by a silver staining procedure. A foamy eosinophilic material is
observed in the lungs during infection. This material is composed of
masses of the organism, alveolar macrophages, desquamated epithelial
alveolar cells, polymorphonuclear leucocytes and other host cells.
Epidemiology: The organism is apparently quite widely distributed in
latent form in healthy individuals and in the dog, as well as a wide variety
of other domestic and wild animals. The organism is thought to be
transmitted by aerosol, although the natural habitats and modes of
transmission of infections in humans are current areas of research.
free forms of the organism may survive in the environment long enough to
969
infect a susceptible host. However, little information on the means of
transmission exists currently. In humans, infections appear to spread
between immunosuppressed patients colonised with Pneumocystis, and
Human and non-human Pneumocystis species have been shown to be
different and host-specific, suggesting that zoonotic transmission does not
occur.
Treatment: Trimethroprim-sulphamethoxazole is the drug of choice for
treatment and prophylaxis of Pneumocystis infections. Pentamidine and
atovaquone are the alternative therapeutic agents in humans.
Control: Control is difficult given that the details of the routes of
transmission are unknown. Infection is generally asymptomatic in animals
and is only likely to be detected in immunocompromised individuals.
Notes: Initially reported as a morphological form of Trypanosoma cruzi,
this microorganism later proved to be a separate genus and was named
Pneumocystis carinii and classified as a protozoan until the late 1980s.
Following further taxonomic revision, Pneumocystis is now classified as a
fungus, not a protozoan. The taxonomy is still complicated in that
Pneumocystis from humans and other animals are quite different and there
appear to be multiple species in this genus. Genetic variations and DNA
sequence polymorphisms are often observed, suggesting the existence of

PARASITES OF THE LIVER
Fasciola hepatica
See Chapter 3 (Sheep and goats).
Capillaria hepatica
Synonym: Callodium hepatica, Hepaticola hepatica
Predilection site: Liver
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: These are very fine filamentous worms generally
measuring between I and 5 cm in length.
Description, microscopic: The males have a long thin single spicule and
often possess a primitive bursa-like structure. The eggs are barrel-shaped
and colourless have thick shells that are slightly striated with bipolar
plugs.
Hosts: Rat, mouse, squirrel, rabbit and farmed mustelids; occasionally
dog, cat and man
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct and differs from that of other Capillaria
species. Adult C. hepatica worms reproduce in the liver and females lay
groups of eggs in the parenchyma where they become encapsulated by the
host's reaction. These eggs are therefore not released directly from the
host. Infection is acquired by ingestion of either the liver, following
predation, cannibalism or carrion feeding, or eggs on the ground that have
been freed by decomposition of the host. Eggs in the soil will embryonate
and be infective in about 4 weeks. When infective eggs are ingested by the
host, they hatch in the intestine and the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall
and are carried to the liver via the lymphatics and the bloodstream.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide (in rodents)
971
Pathogenesis: Adult worms are found in the parenchyma of the liver
Granulomas develop around the eggs, accompanied by fibrosis. Heavy
infections can cause hepatitis and/or cirrhosis and ascites. The liver may
be enlarged and severe infections can be fatal. Heavy infections in man
induce similar hepatic lesions to those seen in other mammalian hosts and
hepatic capillariosis is usually fatal.
Clinical signs: Mild infections are usually asymptomatic. At autopsy, the
liver may have yellowy white streaks on the surface.
Diagnosis: Most infections are discovered at routine autopsy.
slides.
Pathology: The eggs, which are deposited in clusters, provoke the
development of localised granulomas, which are visible through the
capsule as yellowish streaks or patches
Epidemiology: Although the prevalence of C. hepatica is high in the liver
of rodents it lacks host specificity and occurs in a variety of mammals.
Human infection is acquired through ingestion of soil, containing
embryonated eggs, or by consuming contaminated food or water.
Treatment: Oral administration of a modern benzimidazole over several
days can be effective at preventing egg deposition in the liver tissues.
Once egg deposition has occurred, treatment may not be effective.
Control: Destruction of rodents will assist in control.
Notes: The taxonomic situation regarding many species of Capillaria is
complex and recently it has been split into several genera; the old species
names are listed with the new proposed generic names.
Capillariosis in man: three species of Capillaria (C. philippinensis, C.
hepatica and C. aerophila) can infect man. Man acquires C. hepatica
infection through ingestion of soil, containing embryonated eggs, or by
consuming contaminated food or water. Heavy infections in man induce
similar hepatic lesions to those seen in other mammalian hosts and hepatic
capillariosis is usually fatal. C. philippinensis infects the small intestine
972
Philippines and Thailand with sporadic outbreaks in other parts Of
southeast Asia, India, the Middle East and southern Europe. Eggs shed
into water embryonate and are ingested by freshwater or brackish-water
fish and develop to the infective stage in the intestinal mucosa. Infection is
acquired through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish. Large
thought to be the reservoir host. Clinical signs include intermittent
diarrhoea, followed by anorexia, abdominal distention and weight loss.
C. aerophila is very rare.
Opisthorchis sinensis
Synonym: Clonorchis sinensis
Common name: Chinese or oriental liver fluke
Predilection site: Bile ducts, pancreatic ducts and occasionally small
intestine
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Opisthorchiidae
Description, gross: The adult fluke is flat, transparent pinkish, wide
posteriorly and tapering anteriorly and may reach a size of 25 x 5 mm.
The cuticle is spiny in the young fluke but smooth in the adult.
Description, microscopic: The testes are multibranched. Eggs have a
thick light yellowish brown wall, 27-35 × 12-20 μm in size; they contain
a miracidium when they are laid, the internal structure of which is
asymmetrical. The convex operculum of the egg fits into a prominent rim
of the shell, while the opposite pole frequently bears a small hook-like
structure.
Final hosts: Man, dog, cat, pig, mink, badger
(Parafossaiurus, Bulimus spp, Bithynia, Melania and Vivipara). 2. Fishes
belonging to several genera of the family Cyprinidae (more than 40 have
been reported naturally infected)
973
Life cycle: The eggs normally hatch only after they have been swallowed
by the snail first intermediate host. In the snails the miracidium develops
cercariae, which have fairly long tails and elongate bodies with pigmented
eye-spots. After breaking out of the snail the cercaria swims about, and on
meeting a suitable fish it penetrates partly or completely into the tissues of
the fish and, losing its tail, becomes encysted in the fish. Infection of the
liberated in the duodenum of the final host and reach the liver by way of
the bile duct. The prepatent period is 16 days.
Geographical distribution: China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Japan, India
and parts of the former Soviet Union
Pathogenesis: The worms live in the narrow proximal parts of the bile
ducts. The young flukes, in particular, with their cuticular spines, cause
cholangitis, pericholangitis, cholecystitis with desquamation of the
epithelium, and may in rare cases bring about bile stasis by blocking up
the passages, resulting in jaundice.
Clinical signs: Symptoms are not generally seen except in heavy
infections. The symptoms in humans include anaemia, emaciation, ascites,
jaundice and diarrhoea.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on the identification of the characteristic
eggs in faecal samples, which have to be differentiated from other
trematode eggs such as Heterophyes, Metagonimus and other Opisthorchis
species. Several serological tests have been developed, but most are
non-specific. A reported enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
may be of value.
 g  o    sg  
infections there is fibrosis of the smaller bile ducts and cholangiohepatitis
adenomatous proliferation of the epithelium of the bile ducts takes place,
together with cirrhosis of the liver and this frequently leads to the
formation of cysts enclosing eggs and flukes.
Epidemiology: Carnivores or humans usually acquire infection by eating
raw fish. In some fish, the metacercariae are found only under the scales
and animals that are fed with the scales and offal of such fish become
974
infected, while humans who eat the rest of the fish do not. Infection is
usually aggregated in a small number of individuals.
Treatment: Praziquantel at 25 mg/kg on 3 consecutive days has been
reported to be effective.
Control: Cats and dogs act as reservoirs for human infection. Prevention
relies on avoiding feeding or eating of raw, undercooked or improperly
pickled, salted, smoked or dried fish. Freezing fish for a week at -10°C

Life cycle: The prepatent period is 2-3 weeks
Geographical distribution: Southern Asia, Europe, Russia, Canada
Pathogenesis: Most infections are asymptomatic, depending on the level

predisposing to cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Pathology: Light infestations may cause little pathology, but in heavier
infections there is fibrosis of the smaller bile ducts, and cholangiohepatitis
Adenocarcinoma of the liver or pancreas in cats and humans has been
reported.
Notes: There is some uncertainty regarding the proper classification of
opisthorcid flukes and many texts suggest the reported species of
Opisthorchis are synonymous.
Metorchis albidus
Synonym:Distoma albicum,Opisthorchisalbidus
Common name: Liver fluke
Predilection site: Bile ducts, gallbladder
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Opisthorchiidae
Description, gross: The fluke is spatulate, pointed anteriorly, rounded and
flat posteriorly, 2.5-3.5 x 1.0-1.6 mm with a spinous cuticle. The genital
 pore is in front of the ventral sucker.
Description, microscopic: Eggs are small, 24-30 x 13-16 μm.
Definitive hosts: Dog, cat, fox, seal
Intermediate hosts: Two are required: 1. Freshwater snails. 2. Fish,

976
Geographical distribution: Europe, Asia, North America
Several other species of liver flukes of the family Opisthochiidae are
found in dogs and cats and are summarised in Table 6.9. Details are
essentially similar to those of other opisthorcid flukes.
Platynosomum fastosum
Synonym:Platynosomumconcinnum
Common name: Cat liver fluke, “lizard poisoning
Predilection site: Bile and pancreatic ducts
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Dicrocoeliidae
Description, gross: The adult fluke is lanceolate and measures 4-8 x
1.5-2.5 mm.
Description, microscopic: The eggs are brown, oval, thick-shelled and
operculate 34-50 × 23-35 μm.
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: Eggs passed in the faeces develop in a land snail (Sublima),
and a crustacean (woodlouse). Cercariae encyst when a lizard eats the
wood louse. The cat is infected by ingesting an infected lizard, which acts
as an obligate paratenic host.

Control: Preventing cats from hunting lizards can control infection.
Predilection site: Bile and pancreatic ducts
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Dicrocoelidae
Description, gross: The body is thick, 8-16 × 5-8.5 mm in size, armed

Description, microscopie: The eggs are small, 45 × 35 μm, asymmetrical,
dark brown with an operculum and a miracidium.
Hosts: Cat, fox, racoon
Life cycle: The life cycle is unknown but is thought to involve snail
intermediate hosts of the genus Mesodon. Animals are likely to become
infected by ingestion of the snail intermediate host.
Geographical distribution: North America
Pathogenesis: Infection is usually well tolerated, and causes no apparent
ill-health. Infection in the cat has been reported to cause weight loss and
vomiting due to pancreatic fibrosis and atrophy.
Clinical signs: Mild infections are usually asymptomatic.
Diagnosis: Based on faecal examination for eggs and necropsy

Epidemiology: This is a common parasite of the pancreatic ducts of the
racoon. Cats presumably become infected by ingestion of the intermediate
host.
Treatment: Praziquantel may be effective against these flukes.
979
Control: This is difficult because of the longevity of the eggs, the wide
distribution of the intermediate hosts and the number of reservoir hosts.
Leishmaniadonovani infantum
Subspecies: Leishmania infantum (Leishmania chagasi)
Synonym: Leishmania donovani complex
Common name: Visceral leishmaniosis, kala-azar, infantile or
Mediterranean leishmaniosis (L. infantum)
Predilection site: Skin, liver, spleen
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: Leishmania amastigotes are small, round or oval bodies.
1.5-3.0 × 2.5-6.5 μm, located within macrophages and possessing a large
nucleus and  rod-shaped  kinetoplast  associated  with a rudimentary
flagellum, which does not extend beyond the cell margin.
Hosts: Man, dog, fox (Vulpes vuipes), black rat (Rattus rattus), racoon
(Nyctereutes procyonoides), jackal (Canis aureus), wolf and fennic fox
(Fennecus zerda), bush dog (Lycalopex vetuius)
Life cycle: The leishmanial, or amastigote form, after ingestion by a
sandfly, transforms into a promastigote form in the insect gut in which the
kinetoplast is situated at the posterior end of the body. These divide
repeatedly by binary fission, migrate to the proboscis, and when the insect
subsequently feeds, are inoculated into a new host. Once within a
starts to divide.
Geographical distribution: Southern France (Cevennes Hills), central
and western Mediterranean basin (Europe and Africa), Iran (L. infantum),
central and southern America (Mexico to northern Argentina) (L. chagasi)
Pathogenesis: In dogs, L. donovani infantum may cause either visceral or
cutaneous lesions, the latter being more common (Fig. 6.17). It may take
many months or even years for infected dogs to develop clinical signs, so
that the disease may only become apparent long after dogs have left
980
endemic areas. The disease is usually chronic with low mortality, although
  s o  g id   s i  !
proper expression of cell-mediated immunity; if this does not occur, the
active lesion persists, leading to chronic enlargement of the spleen, liver
and lymph nodes and persistent cutaneous lesions.
Clinical signs: In the cutaneous form in the dog, lesions are confined to
shallow skin ulcers often on the lip or eyelid, from which recovery is often
spontaneous. In the visceral form, which is more common, dogs initially
develop 'spectacles' due to depilation of hair around the eyes and this is
followed by generalised loss of body hair and eczema, leishmanial
organisms being present in large numbers in the infected skin. Intermittent
fever, anaemia, cachexia and generalised lymphadenopathy are also
typical signs. Long periods of remission followed by the reappearance of
clinical signs is not uncommon.
Fig. 6.17 Forelimbs of dog with cutaneous lesions of Leishmania
infantum.
Diagnosis: This depends on the demonstration of the amastigote parasites
in smears or scrapings from affected skin or from lymph node or marrow
biopsies. Confirmation in an individual case may be difficult, particularly
if signs are non-specific. Intracellular or extracellular amastigotes can be
identified in Giemsa or Leishman's stained aspirates, impression or biopsy
samples from lymph node, bone marrow, spleen or skin lesions. PCR and
immunocytochemistry methods have been developed for use on these
981
samples offering greater sensitivity. Serological assays using indirect
immunofluoresence (IFAT), enzyme linked immuno-absorbent assay
P        
laboratories can carry out culture and species identification using
isoenzyme analysis and RAPD PCR.
Pathology: Visceral leishmaniosis is essentially a reticuloentotheliosis.
Reticuloendothelial cells are increased in number and invaded by the
parasites. The enormously enlarged spleen is congested with prominent
Malpighian corpuscles. The liver is enlarged with fatty infiltration of
Kuppfer cells. Macrophages, myelocytes and neutrophils of the bone
marrow are filled with parasites. Lymph nodes are usually enlarged and
the intestinal mucosa is infiltrated with macrophages filled with parasites.
Epidemiology: Dogs are commonly infected and transmission is by
sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus (P. ariasi, P. perniciosus, P.
longcuspis, P. chinensis, P. mongolensis, P. caucasius) in the
Mediterranean area and the genus Lutzomyia (L. fongipaipis, L. evansi) in
Central and South America. The dog is the principal urban reservoir, with
infection rates as high as 20% in some countries, and the most important
source of human infection. It is probable that most dogs in endemic areas
are exposed to disease and will either develop clinical or subclinical
infection or become immune and resistant to infection. Leishmaniosis is
diagnosed in dogs in countries where sandfly vectors do not occur,
suggesting a currently unknown mechanism of transmission. Vertical
transmission from dam to offspring has been reported and transmission by
infected blood transfusion has been reported.
Treatment: Several drugs are used for treating canine leishmaniosis
(Table 6.l0). These include the pentavalent antimonials, of which
meglumine antimonate is the main drug, used either alone, or in
combination with other drugs, particularly allopurinol. Allopurinol can
 n  a i e e n  o
aminoside and ketoconazole.
Control: From the public health aspect, the destruction of infected dogs,
and stray dogs generally, is desirable, although often unacceptable. In
some areas, the population of sandflies has been reduced as a result of
mosquito control for malaria, and as a result the incidence of
leishmaniosis has decreased. Generally though, chemical control of
982
sandfly vectors has had very limited success. A deltamethrin-impregnated
collar offers some protection of dogs from sandfly bites and appears to
decrease the rate of infection in dogs and people in endemic areas.
and causes visceral leishmaniosis. In humans the incubation period may
be several months with spasmodic fever. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly
followwithmortality of 75-95%.

Hepatozoon canis
Synonym: Leucocytozoon canis
Common name: Canine hepatozoonosis
Predilection site: Blood, liver, kidney
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Hepatozoidae
Description: Gamonts, found in circulating neutrophils are ellipsoidal in
shape, about 11 x 4 μm, and are enveloped in a thick membrane (Fig.
6.18). Meronts are usually round to oval, about 30 μm in diameter, and
include elongated micromerozoites with defined nuclei, which in
cross-section have a 'wheel-spoke' appearance.
Hosts: Dog
983
Life cycle: The life cycle involves two hosts. The tick is a final host in
which syngamy occurs, and the dog is an intermediate host in which
asexual reproduction occurs. Nymphal ticks engorge with gamont-infected
leucocytes in an infected dog. Following ingestion the gamonts are freed
from the leucocytes, associate in pairs and transform into male and female
gametes leading to the formation of zygotes and oocysts. Each mature
After the tick moults, oocysts are found in the haemocoele and each tick
may carry thousands of infective sporozoites. Since the sporozoites remain
in the body cavity, the dog is apparently infected by ingesting the tick.
Once ingested the sporozoites are released from the oocysts, penetrate the
intestinal wall and are transported to target tissues and organs, in the blood
and lymph. They primarily infect the spleen, lymph nodes and bone
marrow where merogony occurs in macrophages and endothelial cells.
Two forms of meronts are found in infected tissues, one type containing
two to four macromerozoites, and a second type containing 20 elongated
micromerozoites. When the meront matures and ruptures, merozoites are
released and penetrate circulating neutrophils, in which they develop into
gamonts that circulate in peripheral blood. The cycle is completed when
the tick ingests infected blood. The period of development in the dog from
infection to the appearance of gamonts is about 28 days.

infection associated with a limited degree of inflammatory reaction.
However, infection may vary from asymptomatic in dogs with a low
parasitaemia, to life threatening in animals that present with a high
concurrent infections with parvovirus, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys,
Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania infantum, or immune suppression in the
young neonate or those with primary or induced immunodeficiency. High
parasitaemias can cause direct injury to the affected tissues and affect the
immune system, leading to extreme loss of weight and cachexia, although
infected dogs may maintain a good appetite.
          
animals but produce severe and fatal disease in others. Mild disease is
common and is usually associated with low level H. canis parasitaemia
(1-5%), frequently in association with a concurrent disease. A more
severe disease, characterised by lethargy, fever and severe weight loss, is
found in dogs with high parasitaemia often approaching 100% of
circulating neutrophils. Dogs presenting with both leucocytosis and high
parasitaemia may have a massive number of circulating gamonts (>50 000
gamonts/mm blood).
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is usually made on the identification of gamonts in
the cytoplasm of neutrophils (more rarely monocytes) in Giemsa or
Wright's stained blood smears. Between 0.5% and 5% of neutrophils are
commonly infected although this may reach as high as 100% in severe
infections. An indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and western blot

andanormocytic,
normochromic non-regenerative anaemia.

histopathological specimens in dogs from endemic areas. In dogs with low
parasitaemias, few lesions are usually observed. In dogs with high
parasitaemias, there may be hepatitis, pneumonia and glomerulonephritis
associated with numerous meronts. Meronts and developing gamonts are
also found in lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow.
          
Rhipicephalus sanguineus, which is found in warm and temperate regions
all over the world. Infection is transmitted trans-stadially from nymph to
985
adult stages of the tick vectors. Infection appears to be mainly from
ingestion of infected ticks. Vertical transmission has been reported.
Treatment: Infection is treated with imidocarb dipropionate at 5-6 mg/kg
every 14 days until gamonts are no longer present in blood smears. Oral
doxycycline at 10 mg/kg daily for 21 days in combination with imidocarb
from peripheral blood and require regular haematological evaluation.
Treatment of all infected dogs is recommended as parasitaemia may
increase over time and develop into a severe infection. The prognosis for
dogs with a low parasitaemia is generally good, but less favourable for
those with a high parasitaemia.
Control: Prophylaxis depends on regular tick control using an effective
acaricide and close examination of animals for the presence of ticks. In
areas where the disease is endemic, dogs should be prevented from
scavenging or eating raw meat or organs from wildlife.
Notes: The closely related H. americanum was initially reported to be a
strain of H. canis but is now considered a separate species, based on
clinical disease manifestations, pathology, morphological and genetic
differences.
PARASITES OF THE
CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Angiostrongylus vasorum
Synonym: Haemostrongyius vasorum
Common name: French heartworm
Predilection site: Right ventricle, pulmonary artery
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Metastrongyloidea
Description, gross: Slender worms up to 2.5 cm long. Males are 14-18
mm with a small bursa in which the rays are distinguishable.
986
Description, microscopic: The ventral rays are fused for most of their
length and the dorsal ray is stout with stout terminal branches. Females are
18-25 mm and the white ovaries are coiled round the red intestine (Fig.
6.19) with the vulva in the posterior half of the body.
Fig. 6.19 Female Angiostrongyius vasorum in the pulmonary artery.
First-stage larvae are 330 μm in length and have a small cephalic button
and a wavy tail with a sub-terminal notch.
Final hosts: Dog, fox and other canids
Intermediate hosts: Terrestrial molluscs, mainly snails and slugs
Life cycle: The genus is ovo-viviparous. The adult worms in the larger
pulmonary vessels lay eggs, which are carried to the capillaries, where
they hatch. The L1 break into the alveoli, migrate to the trachea and thence
to the alimentary tract to be passed in the faeces. Further development
takes place after entry into the intermediate host, the infective stage being
infective L3, freed by digestion, travel to the lymph nodes adjacent to the
alimentary tract, where both parasitic moults take place, and then to the

than 2 years.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, except in the Americas.
Prevalent in western Europe
Pathogenesis: Canine angiostrongylosis is usually a chronic condition,
extending over months or even years. Much of the pathogenic effect is
attributable to the presence of the adult worms in the larger vessels and
eggs and larvae in the pulmonary arterioles and capillaries. Blockage of
congestive cardiac failure.
Clinical signs: In recently established infections the resting dog usually
shows no clinical signs, but if a substantial number of worms is present,
the active animal will often show tachycardia, tachypnoea, with a heavy
productive cough, the sputum sometimes showing blood. In longer
established severe infections signs are present even in the resting dog.
There may be recurrent syncope. As a consequence of reduced
blood-clotting capacity, slowly developing painless swellings may appear
in dependent areas, such as the lower abdomen and intermandibular space,
and on the limbs where bruising has occurred. Chronic infections may be
occur. The rare acute infection, normally seen in young animals, shows
dyspnoea and violent cough with white-yellow, occasionally bloody,
sputum.
Diagnosis: The L1, which may be present in faeces and sputum, has a
small cephalic button, and a wavy tail with a sub-terminal notch, and its
presence in association with respiratory and circulatory signs is accepted
as confirmatory.
Pathology: The cut surface of the lung is mottled and reddish purple. One
reported systemic effect, which is unusual in helminth infections, is
interference with the blood-clotting mechanism, so that subcutaneous
haematomata may be present. In the larger blood vessels, there is
endarteritis and periarteritis which progress to fibrosis, and at necropsy the
vessels have a pipe-stem feel on palpation. The vascular change may
extend to the right ventricle, with endocarditis involving the tricuspid
valve.
988
Epidemiology: Though worldwide in general distribution, A. vasorum is
only prevalent in certain localities, and these are invariably rural. In
Europe, endemic foci have been recognised in France, Spain, Eire and
England.
Treatment: Mebendazole and fenbendazole at increased dose rates and
levamisole have proved effective.
Control: Control is impractical in most cases, due to the ubiquity of the
molluscan intermediate hosts.
Dirofilariaimmitis
Synonym:Nochtiellaimmitis
Common name: Canine heartworm
Predilection site: Cardiovascular system. Adults are in the right ventricle,
right atrium, pulmonary artery and posterior vena cava
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Filarioidea
 o l   s  s 
Adult females measure 25-30 cm, with the males about half as long.
Many worms are usually found together in a tangled mass. The size and
site are diagnostic for D. immitis.
Description, microscopic: The male tail has the typical loose spiral
common to the filarioids, and the tail bears small lateral alae. There are
4-6 pairs of ovoid papillae. The left spicule is long and pointed; the right
spicule is smaller and ends bluntly. In the female the vulva is situated just
behind the end of the oesophagus. The microfilariae in the blood are not
ensheathed and are 307-332 μm in length by 6.8 μm wide. They have a
tapered anterior end and blunt posterior end.
Final hosts: Dog, fox, wild canids; occasionally cat and other wild felids
and rarely man
Intermediate hosts: Mosquitoes of the genera Aedes, Anopheies and
Culex
989
Life cycle: The adults live in the heart and adjacent blood vessels and the
females release microfilariae directly into the bloodstream. These
microfilariae can live for several months in the visceral blood vessels.
Development to L3 in the mosquito takes about 2 weeks, by which time
the larvae are present in the mouthparts and the final host is infected when
    a op a u  q r e s so a
subcutaneous or subserosal tissues and undergo two moults over the next
heart via the venous circulation. The minimum prepatent period is about 6
months. The adult worms survive for several years and patency has been
recorded for over 5 years.
Geographical   distribution:   Warm-temperate  and   tropical   zones
throughout the world including North and South America, southern
Europe, India, China, Japan, Australia.
Pathogenesis: This is associated with the adult parasites (Fig. 6.20).
Many dogs infected with low numbers of D. immitis show no apparent ill
effects and it is only in heavy chronic infections that circulatory distress
occurs, primarily due to obstruction to normal blood flow leading to
chronic congestive right-sided heart failure. The presence of a mass of
active worms can cause an endocarditis in the heart valves and a
proliferative pulmonary endarteritis, possibly due to a response to parasite
excretory products. In addition, dead or dying worms may cause
pulmonary embolism. After a period of about 9 months the effect of the
ventricular hypertrophy, which may lead to congestive heart failure with
the usual accompanying signs of oedema and ascites. At this stage the dog
is listless and weak.

haemoglobinuria, bilirubinaemia, icterus, dyspnoea, anorexia and
collapse. Death may 0ccur within 2-3 days. Very occasionally there is
a
glomerulonephritis, possibly related to the deposition of immune
complexes.
In cats, pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure and caval
syndrome are less common, and more commonly the presence of the
parasites in the distal pulmonary arteries may induce a diffuse pulmonary
pneumonia. Ectopic infections are more commonly seen in cats with
 parasites reported in the eye, CNS and subcutaneous tissues.
Clinical signs: Heavily infected dogs are often listless and there is a
gradual loss of condition and exercise intolerance. They have a chronic
soft cough with haemoptysis and in the later stages of the disease become
dyspnoeic and may develop oedema and ascites. The acute vena caval
syndrome described above is characterised by haemoglobinuria, icterus
and collapse. Lighter infections in working dogs may be responsible for
991
poor performance during periods of sustained exercise. Infected cats may
show coughing, tachypnoea and dyspnoea and heavy infections can be
fatal.
Diagnosis: This is based on the clinical signs of cardiovascular
dysfunction and the demonstration of the appropriate microfilariae in the
blood. Non-microfilaraemic dogs may however still harbour adult
parasites. Affected dogs are seldom less than l year old and most are over
2years. [n suspected cases in which the microfilariae cannot be
demonstrated, thoracic radiography may show the thickening of the
pulmonary artery, its tortuous course and right ventricular hypertrophy.
Angiography may also be used to demonstrate the vascular changes more
clearly. At necropsy, adult worms are often present in the right heart
chambers and adjacent large blood vessels.
[mmunodiagnostic tests are also available commercially to identify cases
that do not have a detectable microfilaraemia. For example there are a
number of ELISA test kits for the detection of circulating heartworm
antigens, or specific antibodies, that will identify most mature infections
and which are highly specific.
The identification of the microfilariae in the blood (samples ideally taken
in the early evening) is aided by concentrating the parasites following
lysis, filtration and then staining with methylene blue or May-Grunwald
Giemsa. Commercial kits are available for this technique. Alternatively

sediment mixed with a blue stain and examined as a microscopic smear.
The microfilariae have to be differentiated from those of Dipetaionema
reconditum, a filarial parasite commonly found in the subcutis in dogs
Those of D. immitis are more than 300 μm in length and have a tapered
head and a straight tail; those of D. reconditum are less than 300 μm in
length and have a blunt head and a hooked posterior end. More precise
differentiation may be achieved by using histochemical stains for acid
phosphatase activity. D. immitis show distinct red acid-phosphate positive
 PCR-based recombinant DNA technology.
Heartworm infection in cats can be difficult to diagnose as a result of low
parasitepopulations.
992
Pathology: Heartworm disease is primarily a pulmonary vascular disease
eosinophils, followed by myointimal proliferations which produce
irregular rugose to villous projections that enmesh the worms. Thrombosis
may be associated with either dead or live worms, and thromboembolism
and pulmonary  infarction  following adulticide therapy.  Pulmonary
changes include haemosiderosis, diffuse interalveolar fibrosis and
proliferation of alveolar epithelium. Dead worms commonly result in
pulmonary granuloma formation. Additional lesions of heartworm disease
include those of right heart failure, such as chronic congestion of the liver
and occasionally ascites. Glomerulonephropathy occurs primarily due to
glomerular deposition of immune complexes, leading to a mild to
moderate  proteinuria.  Venal caval syndrome causes severe hepatic
congestion leading to cavernous enlargement of hepatic venules with
phlebosclerosis and thrombosis in the caudal vena cava and hepatic veins.
     n  sns  
dog being the most susceptible natural host. Infection commonly occurs in
dogs older than l year. Intra-uterine infection of puppies can also occur.
The important factors in the spread of heartworm disease can be divided
into those affecting the host and those affecting the vector.
Host factors include a high density of dogs in areas where the vectors
exist, the lengthy patent period of up to 5 years during which time
circulating microfilariae are present, and the lack of an effective immune
response against established parasites. Also a diurnal periodicity of
microfilaraemia ensures that high numbers of microfilariae are circulating
Vector factors include the ubiquity of the mosquito intermediate hosts,
their capacity for rapid population increase and the short development
period from microfilariae to L3 at optimal temperatures. At one point it
was considered that the worms do not occur in areas where the
temperature falls below 16°C, but more recently spread has occurred to
colder zones in Canada and USA.
Treatment: Drug treatment is complex, as the adult heartworms and the
microfilariae differ in their susceptibility to anthelmintics. Treatment
should not be undertaken without a physical examination of the dog and
an assessment of heart, lung, liver and kidney function. Where these
functions are grossly abnormal it may be necessary to give prior treatment
993
for cardiac insufficiency. The usual recommendation is that infected dogs
are first treatedintravenously with thiacetarsamide twice daily over a
2-day period or intramuscularly with melarsamide over 2 days to remove
the adult worms; toxic reactions are not uncommon following this
treatment due to the dying and disintegrating heartworms and resultant
 e p  og  a  o  eo  
weeks. This drug should be used with extreme care (Table 6.11).
A further treatment with a different drug is then given 6 weeks later to
remove the microfilariae that are not susceptible to thiacetarsamide or
melarsamide treatment. Several drugs are now available for this purpose;
the traditional one was dithiazanine iodide, administered over 7 days, and
either this or levamisole given orally over a 10-14-day period has proved
effective. The avermectins are also highly efficient against microfilariae,
as is milbemycin at the heartworm prophylactic dose of 500 μg/kg. These
induce rapid clearance of microfilariae but are not licensed for this
purpose because of occasional toxic or microfilaricidal side effects.
Veterinarians who choose to use either drug as a microfilaricide should
responsibility for administration of the correct dose and provide
appropriate monitoring and aftercare.
Withallof these drugs there is a risk of adverse reactions to dying
microfilariae. In some severe cases, heartworms have been removed
surgically rather than risk adverse reactions following drug therapy.
and this is considered under the next section, on control.
Control: Mosquito control is difficult and therefore prophylaxis is based
almost entirely on medication (Table 6.12). The drug widely used for this
has been diethylcarbamazine, which in endemic areas is given orally to
pups daily from 2-3 months of age. This kills developing larvae and so
pre-empts the problems of treating patent infections and microfilaraemia.
In tropical areas the drug is given all year round, but in more temperate
zones, where the mosquito has a limited season, treatment commences 1
month prior to the mosquito season and ceases 2 months after it ends.
Where prophylaxis is introduced in older dogs or after treatment of an
infected dog, care must be exercised to ensure that the dog is free from
microfilarial infection as anaphylactoid reactions may occur in infected
994
dogs after diethylcarbamazine treatment. Once prophylaxis is introduced,
regular checks for microfilariae should be made every 6 months.

Notes: Of the two species occurring in domestic carnivores, Dirofilaria
immitis is by far the more important. The adults, which are found in the
right side of the heart and adjacent blood vessels of dogs, are responsible
primarily a problem of warm countries where the mosquito intermediate
host abounds, the disease has become much more widespread in the past
decade and the problem in North America is now so extensive that special
heartworm clinics have been created.
Dirofilariosis in man: D. immitis and D. repens can cause aberrant
infections in man. D. immitis induces pulmonary coin lesions that are
normally of little pathological significance. D. repens (see parasites of

integument) more commonly occurs in subcutaneous nodules, particularly
in the ocular area.

TRYPANOSOMES
Members of the genus Trypanosoma are haemoflagellates of
overwhelming importance in cattle in sub-Saharan Africa but also occur in
many other hosts including dogs and cats. See Chapter 1: Parasite
taxonomy and morphology (Zoomastigophorasida) for general description
and Chapter 2: Cattle for detailed descriptions of individual species of
trypanosomes, and their control.
Trypanosoma brucei (brucei)
Subspecies: brucei
Subgenus: Trypanozoon
Common name: Nagana
Predilection site: Blood. T. brucei bucei is also found extravascularly in,
for example, the myocardium, CNS and reproductive tract
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: T. brucei brucei is pleomorphic in form and ranges from
long and slender, up to 42 μm (average 29 μm), to short and stumpy,
 a  s  o s   ( gl )  
blood sample. The undulating membrane is conspicuous, the kinetoplast is
small and sub-terminal and the posterior end is pointed. In the slender
form the kinetoplast is up to 4 μm from the posterior end, which is usually
996
drawn out tapering almost to a point, and has a well developed free
flagellum. In the stumpy form the flagellum is either short or absent and
the posterior end is broad and rounded with the kinetoplast almost
terminal. Intermediate forms average 23 μm long and have a blunt

blood films, the organism moves rapidly within small areas of the
microscope field.
Hosts: Cattle, horse, donkey, zebu, sheep, goat, camel, pig, dog, cat, wild

Clinical signs: The dog and cat are susceptible to T. brucei brucei. The
disease is usually acute, and apart from signs of fever, anaemia and
myocarditis, corneal opacity is often a feature. There may also be

extravascular haemolysis through erythrophagocytosis in the mononuclear
phagocytic systems of the spleen, liver and lungs, but as the disease
becomes chronic there may be decreased haemoglobin synthesis.
Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are caused by mechanisms that
predispose leucocytes and platelets to phagocytosis. Immunological
mechanisms in the pathogenesis lead to extensive proliferation of
activated macrophages, which engulf or destroy erythrocytes, leucocytes,
platelets and haematopoietic cells.
Clinical signs: All domestic animals are susceptible but the disease is
only fatal in horses, camels and dogs. The disease is manifested by
pyrexia, progressive anaemia, loss of condition and depression. Recurrent
episodes of fever occur during the course of disease. Oedematous
swellings ranging from cutaneous plaques to frank oedema of the ventral
abdomen  and genitalia and  petechial haemorrhages of  the serous
membranes are often observed. Nervous signs may occur and include
circling, incoordination, staggering, head pressing, paraplegia, paralysis
and prostration.
998
Diagnosis: The clinical signs of the disease, although indicative, are not
demonstration of trypanosomes in the blood. Occasionally, when the
parasitaemia is massive it is possible to detect motile trypanosomes in
fresh films of blood. More usually, both thick and thin smears of blood are
air-dried and examined later. Thick smears, de-haemoglobinised before
staining with Giemsa or Leishman's stain, offer a better chance of finding
trypanosomes while the stained thin smears are used for differentiation of
the trypanosome species.
More sensitive techniques utilise centrifugation in a microhaematocrit
tube followed by microscopic examination of the interface between the
buffy coat and the plasma; alternatively, the tube may be snapped, the
buffy coat expressed on to a slide, and the contents examined under
dark-ground or phase-contrast microscopy for motile trypanosomes. With
these techniques the packed red cell volume is also obtained which is of
indirect value in diagnosis if one can eliminate other causes of anaemia,
especially helminthosis.
A number of serological tests have been described and include IFAT and
andstandardisation.
Pathology: The carcase is often pale, emaciated and there may be
oedematous swellings in the lower part of the abdomen and genital organs
with serous atrophy of fat. The liver, lymph nodes and spleen are enlarged
and the viscera are congested. Petechiae may appear on lymph nodes,
pericardium and intestinal mucosa. The liver is hypertrophic and
congested with degeneration and necrosis of the hepatocytes, dilation of
blood vessels and parenchymal infiltration of mononuclear cells. A

orchitis, interstitial pneumonia and bone marrow atrophy. Splenic and
lymph node hypertrophy occur during the acute phase but the lymphoid
tissues are usually exhausted and fibrotic in the chronic stage.
Epidemiology: This species, although closely related to the salivarian
trypanosome T. brucei brucei, is mechanically transmitted by biting
999
insects; the usual vectors are horseflies (Tabanus) but Stomoxys
Haematopota and Lyperosia can also transmit the infection. In Central and
South America the vampire bat is a vector and can transmit the disease
(murrina).
Treatment: Dogs can be treated with quinapyramine.
Notes: The original distribution of this parasite coincided with that of the
camel, and is often associated with arid desserts and semiarid steppes.
Trypanosoma congolense
Subspecies: congolense
Subgenus: Nannomonas
Common name: Nagana, paranagana, Gambia fever, ghindi, gobial
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: T. congofense is small, monomorphic in form, 8-20 μm
long. The undulating membrane is inconspicuous, the medium-sized
kinetoplast is marginal and the posterior end is blunt. There is no free
flagellum. In fresh blood films the organism moves sluggishly, often
apparently attached to red cells.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, horse, camel, dog, pig. Reservoir hosts include
antelope, giraffe, zebra, elephant and warthog
Distribution: Sub-Saharan Africa
Clinical signs: The dog and cat are susceptible to T. congolense. The
disease is usually acute, and apart from signs of fever, anaemia and
myocarditis, corneal opacity is often a feature. There may also be
neurological changes resulting in aggressive signs, ataxia or convulsions.
Treatment: Dogs can be treated with quinapyramine

Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
Description: Large piroplasms, pyriform in shape, 4-5 μm in length,
pointed at one end and rounded at the other. Amoeboid forms have been
described that are 2-4 μm in diameter and usually contain a vacuole.
Hosts: Dog
Life cycle: Infective sporozoites present in the tick are injected into the
  e s        
and divide by binary fission within erythrocytes, causing the latter to
rupture during repeated phase of merogony releasing merozoites that
sequestered within capillary networks of the spleen, liver and other organs
from where they are released periodically into the circulation. On
ingestion by the tick these forms become vermiform and enter the body
cavity then the ovary and penetrate the eggs where they round up and
divide to form small round organisms. When the larval tick moults into
the nymph stage, the parasites enter the salivary gland and undergo a
1001
series of binary fissions entering the cells of the salivary gland. They
multiply further until the host cells are filled with thousands of minute
parasites. These become vermiform, break out of the host cell, lie in the
lumen of the gland, and are injected into the mammalian host when the
tickfeeds.

factors, such as immune-mediated destruction of erythrocytes, may occur
Infection may be classified as uncomplicated or complicated. The former
is usually associated with mild to moderate anaemia, lethargy, weakness
and hepato-splenomegaly. Complicated babesiosis refers to manifestations
that cannot be explained by the haemolytic crisis alone and is
characterised by severe anaemia and organic dysfunction. Mortality in
complicated babesiosis often exceeds 80%.
Clinical signs: The more severe forms of the disease in adult dogs are
associated with virulent infections (B. canis rossi, B. canis canis), whilst
pups are more severely affected irrespective of the species of Babesia.
Peracute infections are a feature of B. canis rossi and are characterised by
(sometimes cyanotic) mucous membranes, tachycardia, weak pulse.

haemoglobinuria and there may be widespread organ dysfunction
associated with hypotension, hypoxaemia leading to coma and death.
jaundice, inappetance, marked thirst, weakness, prostration and often
death. Petechial and ecchymotic haemorrhages may be observed on the
gums or ventral abdomen of some dogs. In chronic cases the fever is not
high and there is little jaundice. Anaemia is severe and the affected
animals are listless and become very weak and emaciated.
1002
The disease may take on many different clinical forms. Involvement of the
circulatory system may produce oedema, purpura and ascites, and there
may be stomatitis and gastritis; involvement of the respiratory system may
disturbances, paresis or epileptiform fits. Cerebral babesiosis may be
confused with rabies.
Diagnosis: Examination of blood films, stained with Romanowsky stains
such as Giemsa, will reveal the parasites in the red cells. Species
identification between large and small Babesia is essential with regard to
choice of therapeutic drugs.
A range of serological tests have been developed, with IFAT being the
most reliable test. Titres exceeding 1/80 are considered to be indicative of
cross-react with Neospora and Toxoplasma.

kidneys and muscles are icteric. There may be variable amounts of fluid in
sometimes present on the heart, pleura, bronchi and intestines.
Epidemiology: B. canis canis is transmitted by Dermacentor reticuiatus,
Rhipicephaius sanguineus.
Treatment: In every case, chemotherapy with imidocarb, phenamidine,
diminazine aceturate or trypan blue is advisable immediately after clinical
diagnosis, since death may occur rapidly (Table 6.13). Diminazine has a
low therapeutic index and toxicity appears to be dose-related, although
idiosyncratic reactions may occur. In addition to anti-babesial treatment,
supportive care should be provided. In dogs with severe anaemia blood
transfusion should be considered.

be frequently treated with a suitable acaricide. For dogs visiting
tick-endemic regions, tick prevention should be practised, e.g fipronil
application. In addition, a degree of surveillance of dogs exposed to
infection is advisable so that treatment can be administered as early as
possible. A vaccine has recently been launched in Europe for use against
B. canis. The vaccine contains surface proteins expressed by cultures of B.
canis and B. canis rossi and provides up to 6 months’ protection.

has been identified and appears to be endemic in Galacia, Spain and
transmitted by the tick Ixodes hexagonus.

Babesia felis
Synonym: Nuttallia felis
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite Class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
Description: Small piroplasms, with the majority of merozoites present in
erythrocytes, round, irregularly round and 1.5-2 μm in diameter; some are
elongate, 2-3 μm Iong and may form cruciform meronts.
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: As for B. canis
Geographical distribution: Africa
Pathogenesis: Infection usually manifests as an  afebrile, chronic
low-grade disease.
Clinical signs: Affected animals show anorexia, depression, anaemia,
emaciation, constipation and jaundice.
Diagnosis: Examination of blood films, stained with Romanowsky stains
such as Giemsa, will reveal the parasites in the red cells. Species
identification between large and small Babesia is essential with regard to
choice
oftherapeutic
 drugs. Concurrent   infection  withother
haemoparasites such as Mycoplasma (Haemobartoneila) can be common
in endemic areas and complicates the diagnosis.
Pathology: There is splenomegaly and jaundice, and complications are
wide ranging and include hepatopathy, renal failure, pulmonary oedema
e  e     
immunodeficiency disease, feline leukaemia virus or feline infectious
anaemia (Mycoplasma).
Epidemiology: Natural hosts are wild cats such as the lion and leopard.
The highest prevalence is in young adult cats (<3 years old) during the
spring and summer in endemic regions. The vectors are unknown,
1006
Treatment: The antimalarial drug, primaquine phosphate given at 0.5 mg/
reduces the parasitaemia it does not sterilise the infection. Accurate dosing
is required in cats to avoid toxicity, although vomiting is a common side
effect at this dose rate.
Control: Reducing tick exposure is the best way to prevent infection
although this is rarely achievable in endemic areas. Care must be taken in
cats with the use of acaricides due to their increased susceptibility to many
compounds.
Babesia cati
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Babesiidae
Description: Large piroplasms, pyriform in shape
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: As for other Babesia species
Geographical distribution: South Africa, India
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Not reported
Diagnosis: Examination of blood films, stained with Romanowsky stains
such as Giemsa, will reveal the parasites in the red cells. Species
identification between large and small Babesia is essential with regard to
choice of  therapeutic drugs.  Concurrent  infection with other
haemoparasites such as Mycoplasma (Haemobartonella) can be common
in endemic areas and complicates the diagnosis.
Treatment and control: Not reported
Cytauxzoon cati
Synonym:Theileria felis
Predilection site: Blood
1007
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Theileriidae
Description: The single signet-ring shaped forms present within
erythrocytes are 1-l.2 μm in diameter. Bipolar oval forms, tetrads and
dark-staining 'dots' may also be seen.
Hosts: Cat, bobcat (Lynx rufus)
Life cycle: The life cycle is poorly understood. Infective sporozoites are
injected into the cat from the salivary glands of an infective tick. Meronts
develop primarily within tissue histiocytes in many organs and develop to
release merozoites, which invade monocytes and erythrocytes.
Geographical distribution: USA
Pathogenesis: Infection of domestic cats with the merogenous stage
typically results in a rapidly progressive systemic disease with a high
variation in pathogenicity that may be associated with geographical
location. During the merogenous phase there is mechanical obstruction to
blood flow through various organs, notably the lungs, resulting in a
shocklike state. Intravascular and extravascular haemolysis occurs because
of erythrocyte invasion by merozoites.
Clinical signs: Soon after infection, affected cats develop non-specific
signs, such as anorexia, lymphadenopathy, fever and lethargy, but the
course of the disease is usually rapid, with the onset of a severe clinical
syndrome characterised by dehydration, pallor, dyspnoea, icterus,
recumbency and death. Usually, by the time the cat is presented, it is
severely ill. Most cats die within 9-15 days following infection by virulent
strains, regardless of treatment.

currently no serological assay commercially available
Pathology: Affected animals are markedly dehydrated, with generalised
pallor, jaundice and numerous petechiae and ecchymoses of the
epicardium and serosal membranes of the abdominal organs, as well as the
visceral pleura of the lungs and mucosa of the urinary bladder. Pulmonary
vessels are enlarged and tortuous as a result of vascular occlusion by the
tissue stages. The lymph nodes are enlarged, congested, or haemorrhagic
and oedematous and the spleen is markedly enlarged. Extra-erythrocytic
forms are found within phagocytes in the spleen, lymph nodes, lungs,
liver, kidneys and sometimes veins of the heart, urinary bladder and bone
marrow and contain hundreds of merozoites or indistinct Koch bodies
Epidemiology: This species has been found in the erythrocytes and
tissues of domestic cats in the USA. It is suspected that Dermacentor
variabilis is the principal vector. The natural hosts are the North American
wild cat species, such as the bobcat, and it is thought that transmission to
highest incidence of infection occurs during early summer through to
autumn when ticks are most active.
Treatment: Once diagnosed, the prognosis is poor and treatment often
unsuccessful. Treatment with diminazene aceturate, or imidocarb
diproprionate, both at 2 mg/kg i.m., may be used but may result in
transient worsening of the condition. Supportive fluid therapy or blood
transfusion may also be beneficial.
Control: Reducing tick exposure is the best way to prevent infection
although this is rarely achievable in endemic areas. Care must be taken in
cats with the use of acaricides due to their increased susceptibility to many
compounds.
Hepatozoonspp
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida

Family: Hepatozoidae
Description: Gamonts are found in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and have
an ellipsoidal shape, and round or pleomorphic nucleus.
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: Not known
Geographical distribution: France, Israel, India, South Africa
Pathogenesis: Feline hepatozonosis is characterised by skeletal and
myocardial muscle involvement and is commonly associated  with
immunosuppressive  viral disease caused by feline immunodeficiency
virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). Gamonts are found in
peripheral blood neutrophils, although the level of parasitaemia is usually
low with less than 1% of neutrophils containing gamonts.
Clinical signs: Infected cats have fever, and may show gait abnormalities,
muscular weakness and paresis.

Epidemiology: The epidemiology of the disease and the vector(s) are
unknown.
Treatment and control: Oral administration of doxycycline at 5 mg/kg
for 10 days has been used to eliminate gamonts from the blood of
domestic cats.
Notes: Hepatozoonosis is a rare infection in cats and the species involved
have not been identified.
Anaplasma phagocytophilum

one or more loose aggregates (morulae or inclusion bodies, 1.5-5 μm in
diameter) of blue-grey to dark blue coccoid, coccobacillary or
pleomorphic organisms within the cytoplasm of neutrophils.
Hosts: Sheep, cattle, dog, horse, deer, rodents, man
Life cyele: Obligate intracellular organisms infecting ganulocytes,
predominantly neutrophils, appearing within the cytoplasm as
membrane-bound vacuoles. Multiplication is by binary fission forming
large inclusion bodies (morulae). In untreated animals, the cytoplasmic
inclusions can be detected in circulating neutrophils for 1-2 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Probably worldwide, Europe (UK, Norway,
Finland, Netherlands and Austria), USA, South America, Australia
Pathogenesis: Organisms enter the dermis via a tick bite and are then
spread via the blood and/or the lymph and localise in mature granulocytes,
mainly in neutrophils but also in eosinophils, of the peripheral blood. In
dogs, severe pulmonary inflammation, alveolar damage and vasculitis of
the extremities in the absence of bacterial organisms suggest an
immunopathological course of events, such as cytokine-mediated
stimulation of host macrophages and non-specific mononuclear phagocyte
activity. The infection may also induce an over-active inflammatory
response, such as a septic shock-like syndrome, or diffuse alveolar
damage leading to respiratory distress syndrome. Phagocytic dysfunction
of infected neutrophils may result in a defective host defence and
subsequent secondary infections have been reported.
Both animals and humans can be co-infected with various Anaplasma,

infection to death. The risk of acquiring one or more tick-borne infections
may be dependent on the prevalence of multi-infected  vectors. A.
phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi, for example, share both
reservoir hosts and vectors, and in geographical areas where tick-borne
fever is endemic, borreliosis is also prevalent.

bacterial strain involved. Infected dogs usually present with a history of
lethargy and anorexia. Clinical examination commonly reveals fever,
reluctance to move and, occasionally, splenomegaly. Less commonly,
animals may show lameness, diarrhoea, or nervous signs such as seizures.
Systemic manifestations may include haemorrhage, shock and multiorgan
failure.
Diagnosis: A. phagocytophilum should be considered when an animal
presents with an acute febrile illness in an endemic geographic area.
        
morulae typically appear as dark blue, irregularly stained densities in the
cytoplasm of neutrophils. The colour of the morulae is usually darker than
that of the cell nucleus. Morulae are often sparse and difficult to detect
and a negative blood smear cannot rule out A. phagocytophilum infection.
Specific diagnostic tests include [FAT, immunoblot analyses, ELISA and
PCR analyses. The most widely accepted diagnostic criterion is a
four-fold change in titre by [FAT. However, cross-reactivity may occur

Epidemiology: Rodents as well as domestic and wild ruminants (sheep
and deer) have been reported as reservoir hosts of A. phagocytophilum in
Europe. The predominant reservoir host varies depending on the local
natural and agricultural landscape. The vector of A. phagocytophilum in
Europe is the common sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus. The organisms spend

disease may require treatment for longer periods. The most common side
effects of doxycycline treatment are nausea and vomiting which are
avoided by administering the drug with food.
Control: In dogs and cats, infections can be prevented to some extent by
avoiding tick-infested areas. Careful daily inspection for and removal of
ticks is recommended in combination with the application of residual
acaricidal products. Spray, spot-on liquid or collar formulations are
available with residual efficacy of 1 month or more depending on the
product.
Notes: The newly reclassified Anaplasma phagocytophilum combo nov.
(formerly known as three separate ehrlichiae E. phagocytophila, E. equi
and Anaplasma platys (formerly known as E. platys)) causes canine,
equine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.
Ehrlichia canis
Common name:
Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, tropical canine
pancytopenia
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Rickettsiaceae
Description: Ehrlichia canis is a small pleomorphic Gram-negative,
monocytes, intra-cytoplasmically in clusters (morulae). The earliest stages
are small elementary bodies 0.20.4 μm in diameter, followed by slightly
larger initial bodies 0.5-4 μm diameter, and finally even larger inclusion
bodies 4-6 μm diameter. The organisms stain blue with Romanovsky
stain, light red with Machiavello and brown-black by silver stain.
Hosts: Dog
1013
Life cycle: Infection is transmitted to the dog through the bite of an
infected Rhipicephaius sanguineus tick. Transmission in the tick occurs
trans-stadially, but not trans-ovarially. Larvae and nymphs become
infected while feeding on rickettsaemic dogs and transmit the infection to
the host after moulting to nymphs and adults, respectively.
Geographical distribution: Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia and America
Pathogenesis: Following infection, ehrlichiae organisms enter the
bloodstream and lymphatics and localise in macrophages, mainly in the
spleen and liver, where they replicate by binary fission. From there,
infected macrophages disseminate the infection to other organ systems.
The incubation period is 8-20 days and is followed consecutively by an
acute, a subclinical and a chronic phase. The acute phase may last 24
weeks, and if not treated may enter the subclinical phase of the disease.
Dogs in this phase may remain persistent carriers of E. canis for months or
persistently infected dogs may recover spontaneously, however others
subsequently develop the chronic severe form of the disease. Not all dogs
develop the chronic phase, and factors leading to the development of this
phase remain unclear. The prognosis at this stage is grave, and death may
occur as a consequence of haemorrhage and/or secondaryinfection.
the disease through the production of antibodies that bind to the
membrane of erythrocytes, and platelet-bound antibodies, which appear to
play a role in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia. Other mechanisms
involved in the development of the thrombocytopenia include increased
platelet destruction, shortened platelet half-life during the acute phase and
decreased
1  production   in    the    chronic    phase.   Meningitis  and
meningioencephalitis are associated with extensive lymphoplasmacytic
and monocytic infiltration, perivascular cuffing and gliosis. On rare
occasions morulae may be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of dogs with
of naturally infected dogs, suggests that some of the pathological and
clinical manifestations are mediated by immune complexes.
Clinical signs: E. canis infects all breeds of dogs; however, the German
shepherd dog appears to be more susceptible to clinical disease and more
severely affected than other breeds, with a higher mortality rate. There is
1014
no age predilection, and both sexes are equally affected. The disease is
clinical signs range from mild and non-specific, to severe and
life-threatening. Common non-specific signs in this phase include
depression, lethargy, anorexia, pyrexia, tachypnoea and weight loss.
Specific clinical signs include lymphadenomegaly, splenomegaly,
petechiation and ecchymoses of the skin and mucous membranes, and
occasional epistaxis. Less commonly there is vomiting, and serous or
purulent oculonasal discharge and dyspnoea. In the chronic severe form of
the disease, clinical signs may be similar to those seen in the acute disease
but more severe. There may be pallor of the mucous membranes and
emaciation, and peripheral oedema, especially of the hind limbs and
scrotum, may also be seen. Entire bitches may show prolonged bleeding
during oestrus, infertility, abortion and neonatal death. Secondary
bacterial and protozoal infections may cause interstitial pneumonia and
renal failure.

the conjunctiva and iris, corneal oedema and panuveitis. Subretinal
to a monoclonal gammopathy and hyperviscosity. Neurological signs
include ataxia, seizures, paresis, hyperaesthesia and cranial nerve
dysfunction, and may be attributed to meningitis or meningoencephalitis,
which are more commonly seen during the acute phase.
Systemic manifestations may include haemorrhage, shock and multi-organ
failure.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis of E. canis infection is based on history, clinical
Residence in or travel to known endemic areas, and a history of tick
infestation should increase the suspicion of infection.
In general, the Ehrlichia can be distinguished by the type of cell they
invade. As the name of the disease it causes implies, E. canis invades
mononuclear cells. Intracytoplasmic E. canis morulae may be visualised
in monocytes during the acute phase of the disease in some cases.
Examination of the buffy coat enhances the chance of visualising morulae
in smears. During the acute phase there is an increase in the mean platelet
volume, mild leucopenia and anaemia, and megaplatelets appear in the
1015
blood smear reflecting active thrombopoiesis. Monocytosis, and reactive
monocytes and large granular lymphocytes are also seen. During the
subclinical phase a mild thrombocytopenia is a commonly found disease

compared to non-pancytopenic dogs. Mild transient increase in serum
alanine aminotransferase (AAT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) may also
be present. Anti-platelet antibody test as well as Coombs' test may be
positive in infected dogs.
The indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (tFAT) test is the most
widely used serological assay for the diagnosis of canine ehrlichiosis, and
titres at a dilution equal to or greater than 1:40 are considered evidence of
exposure. Two consecutive tests are recommended, 1-2 weeks apart, with
a four-fold increase in antibody titre indicative of active infection. In areas
complicate the diagnosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA)
for E. canis antibodies have been developed and several commercial
dot-ELISA antibody tests have been developed for rapid in-clinic use.
Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) using specific primers for E. canis
have also been developed. Concurrent infections with other tick-borne
pathogens, such as Babesia spp and Hepatozoon canis, are common in
endemic areas and it is therefore important to examine blood smears of
infected dogs microscopically and to consider multiple serological or PCR
screening for co-infecting organisms.
Pathology: Once present in tissues, E. canis organisms continue to
invade, persist and replicate in cells. Circulating infected cells may induce
vasculitisand

combination with an altered cell-mediated immunity, result in the

the chronic phase, although the mechanisms for suppression are not
completely understood.
Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Transmission has also been shown to occur
experimentally with the American dog-tick, Dermacentor variabilis.
Transmission in the tick occurs trans-stadially, but not transovarially.
Larvae and nymphs become infected while feeding on rickettsaemic dogs
and transmit the infection to the host after moulting to nymphs and adults,
respectively. Adult ticks have been shown to transmit infection 155 days
after becoming infected. This phenomenon allows ticks to over-winter and
infect hosts in the following spring. The occurrence and geographical
distribution of E. canis is related to the distribution and biology of its tick
vector. R. sanguineus ticks are abundant during the warm season, and
living in endemic regions and those travelling to endemic areas should be
considered at risk of infection.
Treatment: Doxycycline at a dose of 10 mg/kg once daily (or 5 mg/kg
twice daily) per os, for a minimum period of 3 weeks, is the treatment of
choice for acute infections, and most acute cases respond and show
clinical improvement within 24-72 hours. Dogs in the subclinical phase
may need prolonged treatment, whilst dogs suffering from the chronic
severe form of the disease are usually unresponsive to treatment. Other

treatment, antibody titres may persist for months and even for years. Their
failure, but progressive decrease in the gammaglobulin concentrations is
associated with elimination of the rickettsia. E. canis antibodies do not
provide protection against re-challenge, and seropositive dogs remain
susceptible.
Control: No effective anti-E. canis vaccine has been developed and tick
control remains the most effective preventive measure against infection.

Description: Ehrlichia ewingii is a small pleomorphic Gram-negative,
neutrophils and eosinophils, intracytoplasmically in clusters (morulae).
Hosts: Dog
Life cycle: Infection is transmitted to the dog through the bite of an
infected Ambylomma americanum tick. Transmission in the tick occurs

of polyarthritis, observed more often with infection by granulocytic
ehrlichiae, arises from haemarthrosis and immune complex deposition into
the joints.
Clinical signs: The disease is usually an acute mild disease that may lead

mild and include thrombocytopenia and anaemia.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis of E. ewingii infection is based on history, clinical
presentation and clinical pathological findings supported by serology.

infestation should increase the suspicion of infection.  Visualisation of
morulae in the respective cell types provides a definitive diagnosis and

neutrophils.
The indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) is the most widely
used serological assay for the diagnosis of canine ehrlichiosis. However,
as D. ewingii has not yet been cultured in vitro, antigen is not readily
available for IFAT.In areas endemic for other Ehrlichia species,
serologicalcross-reactivitywiththemonocyticEhrlichiasppmay
complicate the diagnosis. Anti-E. ewingii antibodies strongly cross-react
with E. canis and E. chaffensis, and do not (or weakly) react with A.
phagocytophilum. The use of western immunoblot and species-specific
PCR assays should be used to confirm the ehrlichial species. Species
determination is important, as A. phagocytophilum is also associated with
intra-neutrophilic morula formation and similar clinical signs in dogs.
Pathology: After entering the canine host through the bite of the tick

invade, persist, and replicate in cells. Polyarthritis may arise from
haemarthrosis and immune complex deposition into the joints and is often
accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation.

scapularis and I. pacificus.
Treatment: Tetracyclines, especially doxycycline, elicit rapid clinical
improvement.
Control: Tick control is the most effective preventive measure against
infection. By targeting the vector, the life cycle and consequently
transmission of ehrlichiae will be interrupted. Common acaracides, such
as amitraz, fipronil, and pyrethrins, when used according to the
manufacturer's instructions, are effective in controlling ticks.
Notes: E. ewingii and the newly reclassified Anaplasma phagocytophilum
combo nov. cause canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. E. ewingii
has been implicated as the cause of human infections in the United States,

particularly in immunocompromised people. The role of the dog as a
zoonotic reservoir for E. ewingii infection is unknown.
Rickettsia rickettsii
Common name: Rocky Mountain spotted fever
Predilection site: Blood vessels
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Rickettsiaceae
Description: Small pleomorphic Gram-negative, coccoid, obligatory
intracellular organisms infecting endothelial cells of smaller blood vessels.
Hosts: Dog, man
Life cycle: Ticks become infected with R. rickettsii by feeding on infected
small rodents that are the main reservoir of disease. Immature ticks
become   infected   and   infection   is  transmitted  trans-stadially   and
transovarially to later tick stages, which feed on larger mammals.
Geographical distribution: USA, Canada, Central America
Pathogenesis: Following infection the organisms enter the bloodstream
and infect endothelial cells causing widespread vasculitis leading to
activation  of  the  coagulation
  and 
fibrinolytic pathways.
Thrombocytopenia  occurs through coagulatory and  immune-mediated
mechanisms. In chronic untreated cases, organs such as the skin, brain,
heart and kidneys may develop multiple foci of necrosis and vascular
injury leads to leakage of intravascular fluids andoedema. Fluid
accumulation in tissues such as the CNS can cause significant brain
oedema   resulting  in  a  progressive  mental  and  cardiorespiratory
depression.
Clinical signs: Infected dogs usually develop fever within several days
after tick exposure. This is usually accompanied by signs of lethargy,
mental dullness, inappetence, arthralgia and myalgia, manifest as
difficulty in rising and eventual reluctance to walk. Lymphadenomegaly
of all peripheral lymph nodes is apparent, and subcutaneous oedema and
haemorrhages may occur rarely on the mucous membranes, and more
1021
commonly in the ocular fundus. Neurological signs may appear due to
meningitis and can include hyperaesthesia, seizures, vestibular
dysfunction and a variety of manifestations depending on the lesion
localisation.Recovery is rapid and complete in those animals receiving
treatment early, before the onset of organ damage or neurological
complications. Once the neurological signs have developed, recovery is
delayed, or signs may be permanent.
Diagnosis: Clinical laboratory findings are non-specific for a generalised
acute phase inflammatory reaction. There is usually a leucopenia in the
acute stages followed by a moderate leucocytosis. A left shift and toxic
granulation of neutrophils may be observed in animals with the most
severe tissue necrosis. Thrombocytopenia is one of the most consistent
laboratory   findings.  Serum   biochemical   abnormalities    include
hypoalbuminaemia, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activity, and
variable hyponatraemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Conduction disturbances

Microscopically, there is a widespread necrotising vasculitis in many
Organs.
Epidemiology: Two tick species, Dermacentor andersoni (wood tick) and
D. variabilis (dog tick), both three-host ticks, appear to be mainly
involved in the transmission of R. rickettsii. Only a small proportion of
ticks may be infected in the overall population of a given area. In addition
to the low prevalence of infection, infected ticks are not immediately
infectious but become so following tick attachment and blood feeding for
periods of 5-20 hours. Dogs usually develop illness during the warmer
months of the year when questing ticks are active. This seasonality is less
noticeable at lower latitudes.

the antibiotics of choice and should be administered for at least 7 days, but
are only effective if they are given prior to the onset of tissue necrosis or

treatment with systemic or topically applied acaricides.
Notes: Rocky Mountain spotted fever is an important zoonotic disease
because of its high prevalence and potentially fatal outcome if diagnosis is
delayed or missed. Early signs in humans may be vague and misdiagnosis
can occur until a rash develops later in the course of disease.
Rickettsia conorii
Common name: Boutonneuse fever, Mediterranean spotted fever, Indian
tick typhus, east African tick typhus
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Rickettsiaceae
Description: Small pleomorphic Gram-negative, coccoid, obligatory
intracellular organisms infecting endothelial cells of smaller blood vessels.
Hosts: Rodents, dog, cattle, sheep, goat, man
Life cycle: Ticks become infected with R. conorii by feeding on infected
small rodents that are the main reservoir of disease. Immature ticks
Geographical distribution: Southern Europe, Africa, India and the
Oriental region
Pathogenesis: Infections appear to be non-pathogenic
Diagnosis: The rickettsiae can be demonstrated by staining blood or organ
smears with Giemsa or may be detected serologically.
Epidemiology: The vector of Mediterranean “boutonneuse’ fever is
Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Apart from dogs, sheep and cattle, other small
1023
free-living mammals, such as rats, mice and shrews, are believed to play

Treatment and control: Not usually required although if suspected,
tetracyclines are usually effective
Rickettsia felis
Predilection site: Blood vessels
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Rickettsiaceae
Description: Small pleomorphic Gram-negative, coccoid, obligatory
intracellular organisms infecting endothelial cells of smaller blood vessels.
Hosts: Cat, dog, man
Life cycle: Fleas become infected with R. felis by feeding on infected
trans-ovarially to later stages, and transmission occurs when the adult flea
feeds.
Geographical distribution: North and South America, Europe
dogs and cats is unknown. Cats infected with R. felis through exposure to
infected fleas develop a subclinical infection.
Epidemiology: In endemic areas of the USA, opposums are major
reservoirs for R. felis. Infection to dogs and cats is transmitted by the cat
flea, Ctenocephalides felis.

Haemobartonella felis
Synonym: Mycoplasma haemofelis, Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis,
Mycoplasmahaemominutum
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Rickettsiales
Family: Anaplasmataceae
Description: Small pleomorphic Gram-negative, coccoid, obligatory
intracellular organisms infecting erythrocytes.
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: The life cycle is not known but may involve transmission by
fleas or lice. Vertical transmission has been implicated.
Geographical distribution: North and South Europe
Pathogenesis: Haemoplasmas induce anaemia by haemolysis and
recrudescence of clinical signs. Recovered cats may remain carriers.
1025
Infection with Candidatus M. haemominutum does not often result in
clinical signs but a fall in PCV does occur.
Clinical signs: In the acute form, there is intermittent fever with a
progressive anaemia.
Diagnosis: The organisms can be detected in blood smears stained with
Romanowsky stain.
Pathology: There are no specific or pathognomonic pathological findings,
although cats with concurrent FeLV infection develop more pronounced
lesions. Tissues are usually pale and on occasions jaundiced. The liver is
often pale and jaundiced. Splenomegaly and lymph node enlargement
have  been  reported.  Histology  of the liver  includes centrilobular
     s     
be haemosiderosis. In the spleen there is congestion, extramedullary
haemopoiesis,   follicular   hyperplasia,   erythrophagocytosis   and
haemosideroisis.
Epidemiology: Transmission of the disease probably depends on
arthropods including lice, fleas, ticks and biting flies and, at least in the
case of H. felis, by ingestion of blood during fighting. Infection is most
common in young cats.
Treatment and control:  Treatment  with  tetracyclines  is effective.
Control of blood sucking arthropods with insecticides and prompt
treatment following cat fights.
Notes: The taxonomy of this species is subject to much debate and there is
a proposal to re-classify it into the bacterial genus Mycoplasma (class
Mollicutes) based on l16s rRNA gene sequences and phylogenetic
analysis. DNA studies have additionally demonstrated the exitence of two
distinct species of H. felis; Mycoplasma haemofelis (large species) and

PARASITES OF THE NERVOUS
SYSTEM
Thelazia callipaeda
Common name: Eye worm
Predilection site: Eye, conjunctival sac and lachrymal duct
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Small thin white worms 1.0-1.7 cm long; males are
7-11.5 mm and females 7-17 mm.
the right. In the female the vulva is in the oesophageal region.
Final hosts: Dog, cat, occasionally sheep and deer
Intermediate hosts: Muscid flies, particularly Fannia spp
Life cycle: The worms are viviparous. The L1 passed by the female worm
into the lachrymal secretion is ingested by the fly intermediate host as it
feeds. Development from L1 to L3 occurs in the ovarian follicles of the fly
during the summer months. L3 migrate to the mouthparts of the fly and are
transferred to the final host when the fly feeds.
Geographical distribution: Far East
Pathogenesis: Lesions are caused by the serrated cuticle of the worm and
most damage results from movement by the active young adults causing
lachrymation, followed by conjunctivitis. Infection may predispose the
host to secondary bacterial infection.
Clinical signs: Conjunctivitis, excessive lachrymation
    o  o    
conjunctival sac or on the conjunctiva following local anaesthesia, or
finding larvae in the lachrymal secretion (Fig. 6.21).
1027
Pathology: Invasion of the lachrymal gland and ducts may cause
inflammation  leading  to  occlusion   and  reduced  tear  production.
Mechanical irritation of the conjunctiva produces inflammation, whilst
damage to the cornea leads to opacity, keratitis and corneal ulceration.
Fig. 6.21 Thelazia in the eye of an infected dog.
Epidemiology: Thelazia infections occur seasonally and are linked to
periods of maximum fly activity.
Treatment: Surgical removal with forceps following the application of an
 e o e s      
of antibiotic eye preparations may be indicated. Ivermectin at 0.2 mg/kg
has been reported to be effective.
Control: Prevention is difficult because of the ubiquitous nature of the fly
vectors.
Thelazia californiensis
Common name: Eye worm
Predilection site: Eye, conjunctival sac and lachrymal duct
1028
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Small thin white worms 1.0-1.5 cm long.
Description, microscopic: A mouth capsule is present and the cuticle has
 prominent striations at the anterior end.
Final hosts: Dog, cat

Geographical distribution: North America
All other details as for T. callipaeda.
Taenia solium
Synonym: Cysticercus cellulosae
Common name: Human pork tapeworm
Predilection site: Small intestine (final host); muscle (intermediate host)
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Taeniidae
Description, gross: The adult tapeworm is 3-5 m long with a scolex,
typically taeniid, having a rostellum with four suckers and armed with two
concentric rows of 22-32 hooks. The uterus of the gravid segment has
 7-13 lateral branches. Adults can survive in humans for many years.
Description, microscopic: Cysts are milky white and have a scolex
bearing a rostellum and hooks similar to the adult.
Final host: Man
Intermediate hosts: Pig, wild boar, rarely dog and man
also show signs of cerebral cysticercosis with convulsions.
1029
Encephalitozoon cuniculi
Synonym:Nosema cuniculi
Predilection site: Blood
Class: Microsporasida
Family: Nosematidae
Description: Microsporidia are obligate, intracellular, spore-forming
protozoa. Trophozoites are 2-2.5 x0.8-1.2 μm in tissue sections or 4 × 2.5
 μm in smears. Spores are about 2 μm long and contain a spirally coiled
polar filament with four to five coils.
Hosts: Rabbit, dog, fox (red - Vulpes vuipes, blue - Alopex lagopus)
silver), cat, mouse, rat, man
Life cycle: The infective spore stages are highly resistant and can survive
innoculated into the cytoplasm of the host cell. There then follows a phase
 ) s      
followed by sporogony to form sporoblasts, which then mature into
spores.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The parasite develops within parasitophorous vacuoles in
macrophages and other cells, especially vascular endothelial cells.
Clinical signs: Infection in dogs is usually asymptomatic, but there may
be loss of condition, posterior weakness, incoordination, apathy and
epileptiform seizures.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis in the live animal is difficult and is usually based on
identifying the lesions on histopathology and observation of the organisms
in Giemsa, Gram or Goodpasture-carbol fuchsin stains. A serum ELISA
test is available.
Pathology: In the dog, there has been reported nonsuppurative nephritis.
encephalitis and vasculitis.
1030
Epidemiology: Not reported in dogs, although in other hosts transmission
via urine from infected animals has been described.
Treatment and control: Not reported in dogs
Toxoplasma gondii
See details and description under Parasites of the locomotory system.
Neospora caninum
Synonym:Histoplasmagondii
Predilection site: Blood
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystiidae
Description: Tachyzoites measure 6 × 2 μm and are usually located in the
cytoplasm of cells. Tissue cysts are oval, 107 μm long, and have a thick
wall (up to 4 μm) and are found only in neural tissue.
Intermediate hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat
Final host: Dog
Life cycle: The complete life cycle of Neospora caninum has only
gondi because of the structural similarity of the asexual stages of the two
parasites. Similarities between the two organisms suggested that N.
caninum was a coccidian parasite whose infective stage was an oocyst.
The definitive host has recently been shown to be dogs, which pass small
numbers of oocysts in faeces from 8-23 days after infection. Tissue cysts
are tachyzoites that can infect a range of animals including cattle, sheep,
 goats and horses. The dog can also act as an intermediate host.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide

particularly of the hindlimbs. Polymyositis and hepatitis may also occur
1031
Clinical signs are first noticed at 1-6 months of age but can be seen in
adults and older dogs. Sudden death due to myocarditis has been reported.
Clinical signs: Fatal, ascending hindleg paralysis
Diagnosis: History of neurological signs, muscle weakness with a
progressive ascending paralysis. An indirect antibody fluorescent test
(IFAT) is available.
         
nerve roots and skeletal muscles, but any organ may be involved including
the skin. In the brain, the grey matter is most severely affected, whilst the
submeningeal white matter tends to be most severely affected in the spinal
suppuration and granulatomous reaction. Chronic lesions are characterised
by lymphoplasmacytic, perivascular infiltrations and gliosis. A marked
fibrosis may develop, particularly in submeningeal areas of the cerebral
and cerebellar cortex. Parasitised muscle fibres undergo rapid necrosis,
and there are massive infiltrations of macrophages, lymphocytes and
plasma cells. Tissue cysts are scarce and usually found only in the CNS
Epidemiology: The dog is the intermediate host, and is also a final host in
prenatal infections. In cattle, infection can be both vertically transmitted
from dam to calf in utero and lactogenically, naturally by ingestion of
food and water contaminated with dog faeces containing Neospora
caninum oocysts, or from cow to cow. The mechanisms of repeat
congenital transmission are unknown at present.
Treatment: If canine neosporosis is diagnosed early, treatment with
trimethoprim, sulphadiazine, pyrimethamine and clindamycin might be
useful. Decoquinate has been shown to kill N. caninum tachyzoites in
cultures.
Control: Dogs should not be allowed to eat aborted fetuses or fetal
membranes, and their faeces should be prevented from contaminating
bovine feedstuffs.

PARASITES OF THE
REPRODUCTIVE/UROGENITAL
SYSTEM
Capillaria plica
Synonym: Pearsonema plica
Common name: Bladder hairworm
Predilection site: Urinary bladder, and occasionally the pelvis of the
kidney
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: Fine whitish, filamentous worms 1-6 cm long, males
measure 13-30 mm and females 30-60 mm.
Description, microscopic: The males have a long thin single spicule and
and colourless, 63-68 × 24-27 μm and have thick shells that are slightly
striated with bipolar plugs.
Final hosts: Fox, dog and more rarely cat
Intermediate hosts: Earthworms
Life cycle: This parasite requires an earthworm intermediate host,
ingested eggs developing to the infective L3 within 30 days. The prepatent
period is around 8 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Many parts of the world
Pathogenesis: It is rarely of pathogenic significance. It can however
occasionally induce cystitis where secondary bacterial infection occurs.
Clinical signs: Infections are usually
/asymptomatic. Cystitis and
difficulty in urinating have been observed.
1033
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on finding the typical Capillaria eggs in
urine.
Pathology: Most infections are harmless; the anterior end of the worm
embedded in the surface epithelium provokes a light cellular reaction in
the lamina propria.
Epidemiology: The route of transmission is via the ingestion of infective
larvae present in earth worms.
Treatment: Successful treatment with fenbendazole at 50 mg/kg orally
daily for 3 days has been reported.
Control: Care should be taken to ensure that runs are clean, dry and
free-draining.

names are listed with the new proposed generic names.
Dioctophyma renale
Synonym:Dictophyme renale,Eustrongyius gigas
Common name: Giant kidney worm
Predilection site: Kidney parenchyma, abdominal cavity
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Dioctophymatoidea
Description, gross: Dioctophyma is the largest parasitic nematode of
domestic animals, the female measuring more than 60 cm in length, with a
diameter of around 1.0 cm. The male is about 35 cm long. The worms are
deep red-purple in colour. Their size and predilection site are sufficient for
identification.

71-84 × 46-52 μm, with a thick, pitted shell and bipolar plugs, and are
unsegmented when passed.
Final hosts: Dog, fox, mink, ferret, otter, pine marten, polecat, mink;
sporadically reported in the cat, pig, horse, cattle and man.
1034
Intermediate hosts: Aquatic oligochaetes (annelids), e.g. Lumbricufus
variegatus
Life cycle: The worms are oviparous. The eggs, in the single-cell stage.
are passed in the urine in clumps or chains, and are ingested by the annelid
   s  n    
development phase in the annelid is about 24 months. The final host is
infected by swallowing the annelid with the drinking water, or by the
ingestion of a paratenic host, such as a frog or fish, which has itself eaten
intestinal wall, enter the peritoneal cavity and eventually penetrate the
kidney. The prepatent period is about 6 months but has been observed to
be as long as 2 years.
Geographical distribution: Temperate and subarctic areas; North and
South America, Asia. It occurs sporadically in Europe, but has not been
recorded in Britain. Its main endemic area is the northern part of North
America, chiefly Canada.
Pathogenesis: The final effect of infection is destruction of the kidney.
Usually only one kidney is affected, the right being more often involved
than the left. The parenchyma is destroyed leaving only the capsule as a
distended sac containing the worms; though there may be three or four
worms in a kidney, occasionally there is only one. Rarely, the worms may

Clinical signs: The main signs are dysuria with some haematuria,
especially at the end of micturition; in a few cases there is lumbar pain.
Most cases, however, are completely asymptomatic, even when one
can cause a chronic peritonitis.
 o        
yellowy brown, with pitted shells, and their occurrence in the urine, singly
or in clumps or chains, is diagnostic.
Pathology: Adult worms in the renal pelvis are very destructive, causing
initially haemorrhagic pyelitis, which becomes suppurative and the
oarenchyma is eventually destroyed until only the tunic contains the worm
and exudate. In the abdominal cavity, the worm often entwines a lobe of
1035
the liver and may cause erosion of the hepatic capsule, leading to
haemorrhage or infarction and rupture.
Epidemiology: As in many of the parasitic infections of domestic
          
intermediate and paratenic hosts are infected. Ranch mink probably
ingestion of infected annelids, frogs or fish.
Treatment: This is rarely called for, although surgery may be attempted
in confirmed cases.
Control: Elimination of raw fish from the diet.
Notes: Dioctophyma (red scourge) infection in man: this has been mainly
recorded in N. America, but other cases have occurred throughout the
world. Annelid intermediate hosts in the drinking water are infective and
uncooked frogs and fish act as paratenic hosts. The adult worms are found
in a thick-walled cyst in the kidney (usually the right) and may cause loin
pain and haematuria.

LOCOMOTORY SYSTEM
Trichinella spiralis

Toxoplasma gondii
Predilection site: Muscle, lung, liver, reproductive system, central
nervous system
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystiidae
Description: Oocysts in the faeces of cats are unsporulated when passed,
spherical and measure 13 × 12 μm (Fig. 6.22). When sporulated, which
takes 1-5 days, the 0ocysts are subspherical and measure 11-14 × 9-11
1036
μm (mean 12.5 × 10 μm), and contain two ellipsoid sporocysts (8.5 × 6
μm), each with four sporozoites, without a Stieda body and with a
residuum.
Intermediate hosts: Any mammal, including man, or birds. Note that the

Final host: Cat, other felids
Life cycle: The final host is the cat, in which gametogony takes place.
Dogs can act as an intermediate host in which the cycle is extra-intestinal
and results in the formation of cysts containing thousands of bradyzoites.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Most Toxoplasma infections in animals are light and
consequently asymptomatic.
Clinical signs:

cells in the brain and the respiratory tract; the associated lymph
nodes are enlarged.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is usually based on serological testing by latex
agglutination test (LAT) or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Pathology: At necropsy, bradyzoite cysts can be demonstrated in cells in
the brain and the respiratory tract; the associated lymph nodes are
enlarged.
Toxoplasma-infected animals, usually rodents, whose tissues contain
tachyzoites or bradyzoites. Direct transmission of oocysts between cats
can also occur. The ingestion of mature bradyzoites is the most important
route and results in the shedding of higher numbers of oocysts than when
infection is acquired from other stages. Following infection, the cyst wall
           
liberated bradyzoites initiate a cycle of merogonous and gametogonous
development culminating in the production of oocysts in 3-10 days.
Oocysts are shed for only 1-2 weeks. During this cycle in the intestinal
mucosa, the organisms may invade the extra-intestinal organs where the
development of tachyzoites and bradyzoites proceeds as in intermediate
hosts.
Dogs are infected by the ingestion of undercooked meat containing
Toxopiasmacysts.
The cat plays a central role in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and the
disease is virtually absent from areas where cats do not occur.
Epidemiological investigations in the USA and elsewhere indicate that

resistant to reinfection. However, a proportion remain as carriers, perhaps
due to the persistence of some meronts, and reactivation of infection with

Hepatozoon americanum
Common name: Canine hepatozoonosis
Predilection site: Blood, muscle
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Hepatozoidae
Description: Gamonts present within neutrophils are ellipsoidal in shape.
8.8 × 3.9 μm, with a central compact nucleus and enveloped in a thick
membrane. The cytoplasm stains pale blue and the nucleus dark reddish
with Giemsa stain. Muscle cysts are round to 0val, 250-500 μm in
diameter with the outer portion made up of concentric layers of fine, pale
staining laminar membranes giving the cyst an 'onion skin’ structure.
Host:Dog
Life cycle: The life cycle involves two hosts. The tick is a final host in
which syngamy occurs, and the dog is an intermediate host in which
asexual reproduction occurs. Both larval and nymphal ticks engorge with
gamont-infected leucocytes in an infected dog. Following ingestion the
gamonts are freed from the leucocytes, associate in pairs in syzygy and
transform into male and female gametes leading to the formation of
zygotes and oocysts. Each mature oocyst contains numerous sporocysts
each containing 10-26 sporozoites. After the tick moults, oocysts are
found in the haemocoele and each tick may carry thousands of infective
sporozoites. Since the sporozoites remain in the body cavity, the dog is
apparently infected by ingesting the tick. Once ingested the sporozoites
are released from the oocysts, penetrate the intestinal wall and are
1039
transported to target tissues and organs, in the blood and lymph. The
parasite infects skeletal and cardiac muscle where it develops between
myocytes within host cells of undetermined origin. Mucopolysaccharide
layers encyst the infected cells in the muscle where the parasite undergoes
adjacent tissue. Neutrophils and macrophages are recruited to the area and
vasculation, allowing infected leucocytes containing gamonts to enter the
circulation and repeat the asexual reproductive phase at other sites. The

muscle and osteoproliferative lesions. Prolonged infection may persist,
perpetuated by prolonged merogony cycles. Muscle atrophy becomes
apparent with chronic disease and can result in secondary weakness.
Clinical signs: Dogs infected with H. americanum are often presented
with fever, generalised pain or hyperaesthesia, muscle atrophy, weakness,
depression, reluctance to rise and mucopurulent ocular discharge. Muscle
secondary weakness. Most dogs maintain a relatively normal appetite, but
weight loss is common due to muscle atrophy and chronic cachexia.
Mucopurulent ocular discharge is common and is sometimes associated
with decreased tear production. Less frequently, clinical signs include
polyuria and polydipsia, abnormal lung sounds or cough, pale mucous
membranes and lymphadenomegaly.

blood. Blood samples should be examined rapidly using buffy coat
smears. Muscle biopsy of the biceps or epaxial muscles is the most
consistent method of identification of the characteristic cysts with
pyogranuloma formation and the presence of parasites. An ELISA for H.
americanum has been reported. Infected dogs have a marked neutrophilia,
a mild to moderate normocytic, normochromic non-regenerative anaemia
and thrombocytosis.

glomerulonephritis and occasionally amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits may
also be found in spleen, lymph nodes, small intestine and liver. Occasional
findings include pulmonary congestion, splenic coagulative necrosis,
lymphadenopathy and congestion of the gastric mucosa.
Epidemiology: The main vector of H. americanum is the Gulf coast tick,
Amblyomma maculatum, which is found in southern North America,
Central America and the northern parts of South America. Infection is
transmitted trans-stadially from nymph to adult stages of the tick vectors.
LarvalA.maculatum can alsobecome infectedandtransmit H
americanum as newly moulted nymphs or adults. Infection appears to be
mainly from ingestion of infected ticks. Vertical transmission has been
reported.
Treatment: There is no effective treatment capable of eliminating all
stages. Clinical remission can be obtained rapidly using a combination of
trimethoprim-sulphadiazine (15 mg/kg twice daily), clindamycin (10 mg/
kg three times daily) and pyrimethrine (0.25 mg/kg daily) over a period of
1041

Larvae pass to the host when the intermediate host next feeds. The
prepatent period in the dog is 8-10 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Africa, USA, Europe (Italy, UK)

Pathogenesis: The worms are not usually considered pathogenic.
Clinical signs: No associated clinical signs
Diagnosis: Dipetaionema reconditum often occurs in the same endemic
area as D.immitis andthe presence of its microfilariae may leadto
misdiagnosis on blood examination. The identification of the microfilariae
in the blood (samples ideally taken in the early evening) is aided by
concentrating the parasites following lysis, filtration and then staining
with methylene blue or May-Grunwald Giemsa. Commercial kits are
available for this technique. Alternatively one part of blood and nine parts
of formalin are centrifuged and the sediment mixed with a blue stain and
examined as a microscopic smear. The microfilariae have to be
differentiated from those of D. immitis, which are more than 300 μm in
length and have a tapered head and a straight tail; those of D. reconditum
are less than 300 μm in length and have a blunt head and a hooked
posterior end. More precise differentiation may be achieved by using
histochemical stains for acid phosphatase activity. D. immitis show
distinct red acid-phosphate positive spots at the excretory pore and anus.
while D.reconditum stains pink overall. Differential diagnosis may be
achieved through the application of PCR-based recombinant DNA
technology.

Dirofilaria repens
Synonym: Nochtiella repens
Common name: Cutaneous dirofilariosis
Predilection site: Subcutaneous, intermuscular tissues
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Filarioidea
Description, gross: The adults are long slender worms measuring from

Pathogenesis: The adults are found in nodules in subcutaneous and
intermuscular tissues and the microfilariae in the blood and lymph. D.
repens is responsible for cutaneous dirofilariosis, causing mild skin
lesions and localised itching. It is of little pathogenic significance in dogs.
In humans, infection is usually asymptomatic. Subcutaneous nodules are
found in the breasts, arms, legs, scrotum, eyelid, conjunctivae, penis and
testes.
Clinical signs: Itching, mild skin lesions, subcutaneous nodules

Epidemiology: Infection is by biting mosquitoes and transmission is
generally confined to warmer months when mosquitoes are active.
Treatment: Treatment is achieved by the surgical removal of the parasites
from skin lesions.
Control: Mosquito control is difficult and therefore prophylaxis is based
almost entirely on preventative medication with avermectins or
milbemycins as used for D. immitis.

Cutaneous leishmaniosis
Several species of Leishmania are responsible for cutaneous leishmaniosis
characterised by a moist ulcerative lesion at the site of insect bites that
may become large and granulomatous.
Leishmaniainfantum
See details and description under Parasites of the liver
Leishmania tropica
Synonym: Leishmania tropica complex
Common name: Cutaneous leishmaniosis, *dry’ oriental sore, Jericho boil
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Description: Leishmania amastigotes are small, round or oval bodies,
 s     x 
nucleus  and rod-shaped  kinetoplast associated with  a rudimentary
flagellum, which does not extend beyond the cell margin.
Hosts: Man, dog, rock hyrax (Procavia capensis)
Life cycle: See Leishmania infantum
Geographical distribution: In the dog, L. tropica occurs in central and
southwest Asia and equatorial and southern Africa, Kenya and Namibia
Pathogenesis: Leishmania tropica causes cutaneous leishmaniosis or
‘oriental sore', the lesions developing at the site of the insect bite.
Gradually the lesion enlarges, remaining red but without heat or pain.
Resolution involves immigration of leucocytes, which isolate the infected
area leading to necrosis and granuloma formation. Macrophages infected
with Leishmania organisms are eventually destroyed, and the animal
recovers and is immune to reinfection.
1048
Clinical signs: It may take many months or even years for infected dogs
to develop clinical signs, so that the disease may only become apparent
long after dogs have left endemic areas. Lesions are confined to shallow
skin ulcers often on the lip or eyelid, from which recovery is often
spontaneous.
Diagnosis: See Leishmania infantum
Pathology: The basic lesions are foci of activated proliferating
macrophages infected with Leishmania organisms. In some cases, these
are ultimately surrounded by plasma cells and lymphocytes leading to
necrosis and granuloma formation.

ECTOPARASITES
LICE
Heavy louse infestation is known as pediculosis. Blood-sucking lice have
been implicated in the transmission of disease such as anaplasmosis.
However, lice are predominantly of importance because of the direct
damage they cause, either by blood-feeding or chewing the skin or hair.
Clinical importance is therefore usually a function of their density.
Transmission of lice is usually by direct physical contact.
1049
Description: Lice have a segmented body divided into a head, thorax and
abdomen. They have three pairs of jointed legs and a pair of short
antennae. All lice are dorsoventrally flattened and wingless. The sensory
Organs are poorly developed; the eyes are vestigial or absent.
Clinical signs: The most notable sign of louse infestation is a scruffy, dry
hair or coat. Restlessness, rubbing and damage to the coat suggest that lice
are present, and when the hair is parted the parasites will be found
 o    m  aq     a a ss

chlorpyriphos, malathion or diazinon), amitraz, pyrethroids (for example
permethrin) and carbamates (for example carbaryl). Organophosphates
and permethrin should not be used in cats; amitraz should be used only
with care at half the dose applied to dogs. The more recent products,
imidacloprid, fipronil and the macrocyclic lactone, selamectin, may also
be particularly effective with high safety margins. However, since the
eggs are relatively resistant to most insecticides, repeat treatments 14 days
apart may be recommended for some products, to kill newly hatched lice.
Control: Since lice spend their entire life on the host animal, control is
readily achieved through the use of topical insecticides on all in-contact
animals. Lice can be spread on dirty, shared grooming equipment so
appropriate hygiene is essential.
Felicola subrostratus
Synonym: Felicola subrostrata
Common name: Cat biting louse
Predilection site: Skin, face, pinnae, back
Parasite class: Insecta
Order: Phthiraptera
1050
Sub-order: Ischnocera
Family: Trichodectidae
Description: This louse is beige or yellow in colour, with transverse
brown bands. Adults are an average of 1-1.5 mm in length. The shape of
the head is very characteristic, being triangular and pointed anteriorly
(Fig. 6.23). Ventrally there is a median longitudinal groove on the head,
which fits around the individual hairs of the host. The antennae have three
segments, are fully exposed and are similar in both sexes. The legs are
small, slender and end in single claws. The abdomen has only three pairs
of spiracles and is smooth with few setae.
Fig. 6.23 Adult female Felicola in ventral view (reproduced from Seguy,
1944).
Hosts: Cat
1051
Life cycle: Eggs are laid on the cat fur and hatch in 10-20 days. The adult
about30-40 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: This is a chewing louse and is the only species of louse that
commonly occurs on cats. Pediculosis is now rare and generally is seen
only in elderly or chronically ill animals. It is more problematic in
matted or neglected fur. Infestations most commonly occur on the face,
back and pinnae, causing a dull, ruffled coat, scaling, crusts and alopecia.
Epidemiology: Generally, infestation occurs via close bodily contact
This species of louse is highly host specific. Infestations may be common
in catteries, where asymptomatic carriers may act as reservoirs. Kittens
may be particularly susceptible to infestation.

Heterodoxus spiniger
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Order: Phthiraptera
Sub-order: Amblycera
Family: Boopidae
Description: Heterodoxus spiniger is a large, slender, yellowish coloured
louse. Adults are about 5 mm in length, with a dense covering of thick,
medium and long setae (Fig. 6.24). It can easily be distinguished from
other lice infesting domestic mammals since the tarsi end in two claws, as
opposed to one in the Anoplura and Trichodectidae. It is thought that H.
spiniger evolved in Australasia as a louse of marsupials that subsequently

carnivores. H. spiniger can be found anywhere on the body of the host.
Hosts: Dog and other carnivores
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical, with eggs giving rise to three nymphal
stages followed by the reproductive adult. However, little detail is known.
Geographical distribution: Confined to tropical and subtropical regions
health such as internal parasitism, infectious disease, malnutrition and
poor sanitation.
Epidemiology: Infection occurs after direct contact with an infested host
animal. Cross-contamination between different host species is possible if
the animals have physical contact.
Linognathus setosus
Common name: Dog sucking louse
Predilection site: Skin of head and neck areas
Parasite class: Insecta
Order: Phthiraptera
Sub-order: Anoplura
Family: Linognathidae
Description: This species of louse is up to 2 mm long when fully fed,
with a long pointed head. It does not have eyes or ocular points. The
second and third pairs of legs are larger than the first pair and end in stout
claws. The thoracic sternal plate is absent or if present is weakly
developed. Paratergal plates are absent from the abdomen.
Hosts: Dogs and other canids

days, giving rise to nymphs that require about 2 weeks to pass through
1054
three nymphal stages. The egg-to-adult life cycle requires about 20-40
days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Linognathus setosus is a common and widespread parasite
of dogs, particularly the long ears of breeds such as the spaniel, basset and
Afghan hounds. It may cause anaemia and is usually of greater pathogenic
significance in younger animals. Linognathus setosus is primarily found in
the head and neck areas and is especially common under the collar.
Linognathus setosus has been shown to harbour immature stages of the
filarial nematode Dipetalonema reconditum, which parasitises dogs.
However, it is unknown whether the lice act as efficient vectors of these
parasites.
Epidemiology: Generally, for the transfer of louse infestation, close
bodily contact is necessary. Lice dropped or pulled from the host die in a
few days, but eggs that have fallen from the host may continue to hatch
over 2-3 weeks in warm weather. Therefore, bedding used by infested
hosts should be disinfected.
Trichodectes canis
Common name: Dog biting louse
Predilection site: Skin, head, neck and tail regions
Parasite class: Insecta
Order: Phthiraptera
Sub-order: Ischnocera
Family: Trichodectidae
Description: Trichodectes canis is a small, broad, yellowish coloured
louse. It is 1-2 mm in length, with dark markings. The head is broader
than long and the antennae are three-segmented, short and exposed (Fig.
n    aas  gn   s  s  
on segments 2-6 and many rows of large, thick setae.
1055
Hosts: Dog, wild canids
Life cycle: Trichodectes canis commonly infests the head, neck and tail
regions, where it attaches to the base of a hair using its claws or
days. Eggs hatch in 1-2 weeks and give rise to three nymphal stages. The
nymphs mature into reproductive adults within about 2 weeks. The
egg-to-adult life cycle requires about 30-40 days.
Fig. 6.25 Adult female Trichodectes in ventral view (from Seguy, 1944)
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Trichodectes canis can be a harmful ectoparasite of dogs,
particularly in puppies and old or debilitated dogs. It is most commonly
found on the head, neck and tail attached to the base of hairs. It feeds on
tissue debris. It is a highly active species and infestation produces intense
irritation around predilection sites. Lice often congregate around body

orifices or wounds seeking moisture. Intense pruritus, scratching, biting.
sleeplessness, nervousness and a matted coat are all typical of T. canis
infestation. Damage to the skin from scratching results in inflammation,
excoriation, alopecia and secondary bacterial involvement.
Trichodectes canis is important as a vector of the tapeworm Dipylidium
caninum. Lice become infected when they ingest D. caninum eggs from
dried host faeces. The tapeworm develops into a cysticercoid stage within
the louse, where it remains quiescent until the louse is ingested by a dog.
during grooming. In the gut of the dog the cystercoid is liberated and
develops into an adult tape worm.
MITES
Infestation by mites is called acariasis and can result in severe dermatitis.
known as mange, which may cause significant welfare problems and
economic losses.
All mites are small, usually less than 1 mm in length. The body shows no
segmentation, although it can have various sutures and grooves. Adult and
nymphal mites have four pairs of legs; larvae have only three pairs. The
body is usually soft but may carry a number of hardened plates. Eyes are
usually absent and, hence, most mites are blind. Hairs, or setae, many of
which are sensory in function, cover the body of many species of mite.
The mouthparts are highly specialised, consisting of a pair of chelicerae,
which may be used for tearing, grasping or piercing
Cheyletiella blakei
Predilection site: Face, but may occur all over the body
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes(Prostigmata)
Family: Cheyletidae
1057
Description: Adults are about 400 μm in length and ovoid (see Fig. 9.14)
They have blade-like chelicerae that are used for piercing their host, and
short, strong, opposable palps with curved palpal claws. The palpal femur
possesses a long, serrated dorsal seta. The body tends to be slightly
elongated with a ^waist'. The legs are short; tarsal claws are lacking and
the empodium is a narrow pad with comb-like pulvilli at the ends of the
legs. Adults are highly mobile and are able to move about rapidly. The
solenidion, on the genu of the first pair of legs, is conical in C. blakei.
However, this feature can vary in individuals and between life-cycle
stages, making identification difficult.
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: All developmental stages occur on the host animal. Eggs are
glued to hairs 2-3 mm above the skin. A prelarva and then a larva develop
within the egg, with fully developed octopod nymphs eventually emerging
from the egg. The mites then moult through two nymphal stages before
the adult stage is reached. The life cycle is completed in approximately 2
weeks. The mites live in the hair and fur, only visiting the skin to feed on
lymph and other tissue fluids. They feed on these fluids by piercing the
epidermis with their stylet-like chelicerae. Adults can survive for at least
1 0 days off the host without feeding, or longer in cool environments.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The mite is not usually highly pathogenic and is more often
found in young animals in good physical condition. Long-haired cats tend
to be more commonly infested than short-haired cats. This parasite is
readily transferred to humans even on short contact, where it causes severe

Human cases will resolve spontaneously when the animal source has been
treated.
Clinical signs: Cheyletiella blakei most commonly infests the facial area
of cats, causing mild eczema-like skin conditions and associated pruritus.
[t is a characteristic of the dermatitis caused by Cheyletiella that many
skin scales are shed into the fur, giving it a powdery or mealy appearance,
and the presence of moving mites among this debris has given it the
common name of 'walking dandruff".
1058
Diagnosis: In any case of excessive scurf or dandruff in the cat
Cheyletiella should be considered in the differential diagnosis. On parting
the coat along the back, and especially over the sacrum, scurf will be seen.
and if this is combed out on to dark paper the movement of mites will be
detected among the debris. Scraping is not necessary as the mites are
always on the skin surface or in the coat.
Pathology: The pathology of Cheyletiella infestation is poorly
understood. In many cases there is very little skin reaction or pruritus. In
small, crusty, erythematous papules involving much of the body surface;
crusts are formed, but often there is only slight hair loss.
Epidemiology: This highly contagious, although mild, mange can spread
rapidly through catteries and kennels. Transmission is usually by direct
contact with infested animals, but the adult parasite can survive for over
10 days off the host and therefore bedding and furniture can act as a
source of infestation. Cheyletiella mites may be phoretic on cat and dog
fleas (Ctenocephalides spp) and may be transmitted by these ectoparasites.
shampoos, such as carbamates (e.g. carbaryl) and fipronil. Selenium
products, with low residual activity, three successive weekly treatments
may be needed.
Control: The cats, all in-contact animals and their surroundings should be
treated to control infestation rates. This is particularly important in
catteries, which often serve as a source of mite infestation.

Otodectes cynotis
Common name: Ear mite
Predilection site: External ear canal. May secondarily infest other parts of
the body including the head, back, tip of tail and feet.
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Psoroptidae
Description: Otodectes resembles Psoroptes and Chorioptes in general
conformation, having an ovoid body and projecting legs (Fig. 6.27). Like
jointed pretarsi. The sucker-like pulvillus is cupshaped, as opposed to
trumpet-shaped in Psoroptes. In the adult female, the first two pairs of
legs carry short, stalked pretarsi, while the third and fourth pairs of legs
have a pair of terminal whip-like setae. The fourth pair is much reduced.
The genital opening is transverse. In males all four pairs of legs carry
short, stalked pretarsi and pulvilli, but the posterior processes are small.

Hosts: Cat, dog and a number of other small mammals including the ferret
and red fox
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, hexapod larva, followed by
octopod protonymph, tritonymph and adult. All developmental stages
occur on the host. The complete egg to adult life cycle takes about 3
weeks. Eggs are deposited at a rate of one per day and are attached to the
host skin. Adult females produce 15-20 eggs and live for 2-3 weeks. Like
Chorioptes, this mite feeds superficially on skin debris.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Most animals harbour this mite, and in adult animals it has
only sporadically with the transient activity of the mites. The development
of clinical signs reflects the development of allergic hypersensitivity by
the host to antigenic substances produced by the mites while they are
feeding. This can result in responses ranging from asymptomatic to severe
otitis and convulsive seizures in different individual hosts. Young animals
probably acquire the mites from their mothers during suckling.
            
which becomes crusty (Fig. 6.28). The mites live deep in the crust, next to
1062
the skin. Secondary bacterial infection may result. Scratching may cause
excoriation of the posterior surface of the ear pinna. The resultant violent
head shaking and ear scratching are a common cause of aural
haematomata. In long-standing cases a severe purulent otitis may result
Fig. 6.28 Dark waxy exudate caused by Otodectes infection in the dog
Clinical signs: In general, the ear canals become inflamed and
excessively moistened with accumulations of brown-black exudates in
cats and grey deposits. This is accompanied by pruritus, intense itching
which causes the host to scratch their ears, shake their head or hold it to
one side and turn in circles. Signs of severe, untreated cases include
emaciation, spasms, selfinduced trauma and convulsions, including
epileptiform fits. Perforation of the tympanic membrane can result. The
clinical signs may be seen in dogs at an earlier stage than in cats and
foxes, which do not appear to be affected until the infestation has reached
high numbers and the disease is advanced.
Diagnosis: Tentative diagnosis is based on the behaviour of the animal
and the presence of dark, waxy deposits and exudate in the ear canal.
Confirmation depends on observing the mites either within the ear or by
removing some of the deposit and exudate and placing it on a dark surface
where the mites will be seen by a hand lens as whitish moving specks.

on a long, stalk-like pretarsus. The sucker-like pulvilli help the mite grip
the substrate as it moves. The third and fourth pairs of legs in the female
and the third pair of legs in the male end in long setae and lack stalked
pulvilli. The mouthparts have a rounded appearance. These mites have no
eyes or stigmata. The dorsal surface of the body of S. scabiei is covered
with transverse ridges, but also bears a central patch of triangular scales.
 The dorsal setae are strong and spine-like. The anus is terminal and only
slightly dorsal.
Hosts: All domestic mammals and humans
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis:
· Dogs. The predilection sites for the mites are thinly haired areas
such as the ears (Fig. 6.29), muzzle, face, and elbows but, as in
other manges, severe infestations may extend over the whole body.
Visually, the condition begins as erythema, with papule formation,
and this is followed by scale and crust formation and alopecia (Fig.
6.30). It is a characteristic of this form of mange that there is
intense pruritus, which often leads to self-inflicted trauma. After a
primary infection dogs begin to scratch within a week, often before
months the whole skin surface may be involved, dogs becoming
progressively weak and emaciated. A strong sour odour is a notable
feature of this form of mange.
· Cats. Sarcoptic mange is rare in cats. In the few recorded cases, the
progressive hair loss from the ears, face and neck, extending to the
abdomen.
Fig. 6.29 Thickened ear edge characteristic of sarcoptic mange.
1065
Fig. 6.30 Severe sarcoptic mange in a dog.
1066
Pathology: Dogs with chronic, generalised disease develop seborrhoea,
severe thickening of the skin, crust build-up, peripheral lymphadenopathy
and emaciation. However, the lesions associated with canine sarcoptic
mange are very non-specific. Usually there is dramatic epidermal
hyperplasia and a subtle, diffuse and uniform eosinophilic perivascular
dermatitis. However, cases may present with no eosinophilic infiltrate and
  e sis    r  
pruritic dermatitis.
 n       
treatment in dogs effective acaricides include the organochlorines, gamma
HCH and bromocyclen, and the organophosphates such as phosmet and
amitraz, but the availabilities of some of these compounds is limited or
non-existent in some countries. Lime-sulphur is highly effective and safe
for use in young animals; several dips 5 days apart are recommended.
1067
Many preparations are combined with a surfactant, which aids contact
with the mites by removing skin scales and softening crusts and other
debris. Selamectin spot-on is effective. Other macrocyclic lactones, such
as moxidectin and ivermectin, are not registered for the treatment of
sarcoptic mange in dogs, but have been reported to be effective depending
on the dosage and route of administration. Hair can be clipped, the crusts
and dirt removed by soaking with a good anti-seborrhoeic shampoo, and
an acaricidal dip applied.
spot-on may give good contol, although this is not an approved
application.
Control: Based on the protected location of the parasites, the duration of
the life cycle and the necessity of killing all mites, dogs should be bathed
weekly with an acaricidal preparation for 4 weeks, or longer if necessary,
until lesions have disappeared. Because this is a highly contagious mange,
affected dogs should be isolated and it should be explained to owners that
rapid cure cannot be expected. To ensure that an outbreak is contained, all
dogs on the premises should be treated if possible. In severely distressed
dogs, oral or parenteral corticosteroids are valuable in reducing the
 pruritus and so preventing further excoriation.

Description: Notoedres closely resembles Sarcoptes with a circular
outline and short legs with long unjointed pedicels, but it is distinguished
by its concentric 'thumb print' striations and absence of spines (Fig. 6.31).
The dorsal scales are rounded and arranged transversely. This species is
also smaller than S. scabiei; females are about 225 μm in length and males
about 150 μm, with a short, square rostrum. The anal opening is distinctly
dorsal and not posterior. Females have suckers on legs 1 and 2.
Hosts: Largely cat, but may occasionally infest dogs or rabbits, also wild
cats, foxes, canids and civets.
Fig. 6.31 Adult female Notoedres cati in dorsal view.
Life cycle: Similar to that of Sarcoptes, except that the females in the
dermis are usually found in aggregations. The fertilised female creates a
winding burrow or tunnel in the upper layers of the epidermis, feeding on
liquid oozing from the damaged tissues. The eggs are laid in these tunnels.
hatch in 3-5 days, and the six-legged larvae crawl on to the skin surface.

These larvae, in turn, burrow into the superficial layers of the skin to
are completed. Development from egg to adult takes 6-10 days. The adult
male then emerges and seeks a female either on the skin surface or in a

presumably from transferral of larvae, which are present more
superficially than the other stages.

and the stratum germinativum, occasionally invading hair follicles and
sebaceous glands, causing hyperkeratosis and thickening of the epidermis.
The infection appears as dry, encrusted, scaly lesions on the edges of the
ears and on the face, the skin thickened and somewhat leathery. Advanced
lesions can give cats a wrinkled, thickened skin with hyperkeratinisation
and hyperpigmentation casuing an ‘old age’ appearance. The associated
pruritus is often intense, and there may be severe excoriation of the head
and neck from scratching. In typical cases the lesions appear first on the
medial edge of the ear pinna, and then spread rapidly over the ears, face,
eyelids and neck. It may be spread to the feet and tail by contact when the
cat grooms and sleeps.
Clinical signs: Intense pruritus, erythema, skin scaling, greyish yellow
crusts and loss of hair. Scratching to alleviate itching leads to excoriation
of the skin, inflammation and secondary bacterial infections. If untreated,
the affected animal can become severely debilitated and notoedric mange
may be fatal in 4 -6 months.

of mononuclear cells and regional lymphadenopathy.
1070
Epidemiology: Notoedric mange is highly contagious and transmission
from host to host is by the spread of larvae or nymphs, but although it
occurs in local, limited outbreaks, it is not a frequent cause of skin disease
Treatment: Skin crusts should first be softened with liquid paraffin or
soap solution before applying an acaricide. Lime-sulphur dips at 10-day
intervals may be used. A 1% solution of selenium sulphide is also
recommended for use in cats; treatment should be given at weekly
intervals for 4-6 weeks, the prognosis being good. Although not licensed
for the treatment of cats, selemectin and ivermectin may prove effective
against Notoedres, although sudden death in kittens has been reported
with the use of ivermectin.
Control: All in-contact animals should be treated and bedding replaced.

opisthosoma forms at least half the body length.
Hosts:Dog
Life cycle: Demodex spp usually live as commensals in the skin, and are
highly site-specific, occupying the hair follicles and sebaceous glands.
Females lay 20-24 spindle-shaped eggs in the hair follicle that give rise to
hexapod larvae, in which each short leg ends in a single, three-pronged
claw. Unusually, a second hexapod larval stage follows, in which each leg
ends in a pair of three-pronged claws. Octopod protonymph, tritonymph

and adult stages then follow. Immature stages and these migrate more
deeply into the dermis. One follicle may harbour all life cycle stages
concurrently. The life cycle is completed in 18-24 days. In each follicle or
gland the mites may occur in large numbers in a characteristic
head-downward posture. In the newborn and very young these sites are

Pathogenesis: For the most part, Demodex mites are non-pathogenic and
significant clinical disease, particularly in dogs, where they cause
demodectic mange or demodicosis.
followed by thickening of the skin (Fig. 6.33). The mange may progress
no further than the in-contact areas; many of these localised mild
infections resolve spontaneously without treatment. On the other hand,
lesions may spread over the entire body, and this generalised demodicosis
may take one of two forms:
1073
·Squamous demodicosis is the less serious. It is a dry reaction, with
thickening of the skin. In some cases of this type only the face and
paws are involved.
·Pustular or follicular demodicosis is the severe form, and follows
bacterial invasion of the lesions, often by staphylococci. The skin

which serum, pus and blood ooze, giving this form its common
name of *red mange’ (Fig. 6.34). Affected dogs have an offensive
odour. Prolonged treatment is necessary, and survivors may be
severely disfigured, so early euthanasia is sometimes requested by
Owners, and by pedigree breeders.
The pathogenesis of Demodex is more complex than that of other mange
factor, which results in immunodeficiency in their offspring, making them
more susceptible to mite invasion. It has been observed that litter mates

of all types of demodectic mange is the absence of pruritus, but this is not
universal.
Diagnosis: For confirmatory diagnosis, deep scrapings are necessary to
reach the mites deep in the follicles and glands. This is best achieved by
taking a fold of skin, applying a drop of liquid paraffin, and scraping until
capillary blood appears. Even in normal dogs a few commensal mites may
be found in the material, but the presence of a high proportion of larvae
and nymphs will indicate a rapidly increasing population, and hence an
active infection. Skin biopsy, to detect mites in the follicles, has been used
in severely affected dogs, but is rarely necessary.

widespread alopecia, desquamation and thickening of the skin. In severe
pustular or follicular demodicosis the lesions observed are variable and
may include comedones, follicular papules and casts. More severely
haemorrhagic exudation and thick crusting. Demarcation between affected
areas and normal skin is abrupt. Lymphadenopathy is common. There is
bacterial invasion of the lesions, often by staphylococci. Dogs with
responsiveness, associated with the secondary bacterial infections. [n
some dogs only pododemodicosis is present. Pain and pedal oedema is
especially prominent in large dogs.
Epidemiology: Probably because of its location deep in the dermis, it is
very difficult to transmit Demodex between animals unless there is
prolonged contact. It is thought that most infections are acquired in the
early weeks of life during suckling. This view is supported by the fact that
lesions first appear on the muzzle, face, periorbital region and forelimbs.
Treatment: Of the available acaricides, the most widely used is amitraz
although the organophosphate, cythioate, may also be applied. With their
deep location in the dermis the mites are not readily accessible to most

prognosis should indicate that recovery will take at least 3 months, and
should, even so, be guarded.
Treatment with oral or injectable ivermectin at 250-300 μg/kg,
milbemycin at 2 mg/kg and moxidectin at 400 μg/kg, have all been used
successfully for  the treatment of generalised canine demodicosis.
[vermectin and moxidectin should be initiated at lower doses and patients
monitored for possible adverse effects during therapy. Where pyoderma is
severe, antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
Control: In controlling the endemicity of demodicosis, it should be noted
that since certain bitches are more prone than others to have susceptible

Notes: Species of the genus Demodex are believed to form a group of
closely related sibling species, which are highly specific to particular
hosts: Demodex phylloides (pig), Demodex canis (dog), Demodex bovis
(cattle), Demodex equi (horse), Demodex musculi (mouse), Demodex ratti
(rat), Demodex caviae (guineapig), Demodex cati (cat) and Demodex
follicuiorum and Demodex brevis on humans. Various morphological
variations may be seen on a host, these are sometimes, probably
incorrectly,ascribed separate species status.
Demodexcati
Predilection site: Hair follicles and sebaceous glands
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order:Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Demodicidae
Description: Species of Demodex have an elongate tapering body, up to
0.1-0.4 mm in length, with four pairs of stumpy legs ending in small blunt
claws in the adult. Setae are absent from the legs and body. The legs are
located at the front of the body, and as such the striated opisthosoma
forms at least half the body length. Short forms may be found on the cat
sometimes referred to as Demodex gatoi; whether these are genuinely a
distinct species remains to be determined.
Hosts: Cat
Life cycle: see D. canis
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Demodicosis is rare in cats. It takes a localised
self-limiting form, confined to the eyelids and periocular region, and is of
the mild squamous type, with some alopecia. Feline demodicosis is
usually associated with underlying debilitating disease such as diabetes
mellitus, feline leukaemia virus infection and systemic
Clupus
erythematosus.
1077
Clinical signs: Erythema, papules and thickened skin crusts, alopecia.
Generalised demodicosis is very rare, but has been reported with variable
pruritus, alopecia, scaling, crusting and hyperpigmentation on the head,
neck, legs and trunk.
Diagnosis: For confirmatory diagnosis, deep scrapings are necessary to
reach the mites deep in the follicles and glands. This is best achieved by
taking a fold of skin, applying a drop of liquid paraffin, and scraping until
capillary blood appears.
Treatment: In cats, 2% lime-sulphur dips may be effective when given
every 5-7 days for six dips; amitraz rinses at 0.0125-0.025% have also
been used successfully. In many cases demodicosis in cats spontaneously
resolves and treatment is unnecessary.
Control: Control is rarely applied.

ENDOPARASITES
PARASITES OF THE DIGESTIVE
SYSTEM
OESOPHAGUS
Capillaria annulata
Synonym: Eucoleus annulata
Common name: Hairworms or threadworms
Predilection site: Oesophagus, crop
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
stichosome oesophagus occupying about one third to half the body length.
Males measure around 15-25 mm and females 37-80 mm.
1086
Description, microscopic: The males have a long thin single spicule, with
a spiny spicule sheath, and often possess a primitive bursa-like structure.
This species has a cuticular swelling at the back of the head. The females
contain eggs that resemble those of Trichuris in possessing bipolar plugs
(Fig. 7.1). The eggs are barrel-shaped and colourless, 60-65 × 25-28 μm,
have thick shells that are slightly striated with bipolar plugs.
Final hosts: Chicken, turkey, ducks and wild birds
Intermediate hosts: Earthworms
Life cycle: The life cycle is indirect. Eggs passed in faeces are ingested by
earth worms and develop to the infective stage in 2-3 weeks. The prepatent
period is about 3-4 weeks in the final host.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Like Trichuris the anterior ends of the parasite are buried
in the mucosa and even light infections can produce a catarrhal
inflammation and thickening of the oesophagus and crop wall. Heavy
infections may cause diphtheritic inflammation and marked thickening of
 q   s s  a 
Fig. 7.1 Capillaria eggs.
1087
Clinical signs: Light infections of less than 100 worms may cause poor
weight gains and lowered egg production. Heavy infections often induce
inappetence and emaciation.
Diagnosis: Because of the non-specific nature of the clinical signs and the
fact that, in heavy infections, these may appear before Capillaria eggs are
present in the faeces, diagnosis depends on necropsy and careful
examination of the oesophagus and crop for the presence of the worms.
This may be carried out by microscopic examination of mucosal scrapings
squeezed between two glass slides; alternatively the contents should be
 gently washed through a fine sieve and the retained material resuspended
in water and examined against a black background.
Pathology: Presence of the adult worms causes catarrhal inflammation
and thickening of the oesophagus and crop wall. Heavy infections may
cause diphtheritic inflammation and marked thickening of the wall.
Epidemiology: Young birds are most susceptible to Capillaria infections
while adults may serve as carriers. The epidemiology is largely based on
the ubiquity of the earthworm intermediate host.
1088
Treatment: Levamisole in the drinking water is highly effective as are a
number of benzimidazoles given in the feed. Elevated oral doses of these
anthelmintics, administered over several days, also give high efficacy.
if possible, by moving the birds to fresh ground. Scrubbing and heat
in chicken houses.
Notes: The taxonomic situation regarding many species of Capillaria is
complex and recently it has been split into several genera; the old species
names are listed with the new proposed generic names.
Capillaria contorta
See under Crop.
Several spiruroid worms are found in the oesophagus, crop and
proventriculus of poultry. The life cycles of these parasites are indirect,
involving a range of invertebrate hosts. Infections with these parasites are
spiruroids are unlikely to be successful because of the ready availability of
the intermediate hosts.

Trichomonas gallinae
Synonym: Cercomonas gallinae, Trichomonas cofumbae
Common name: Canker,frounce,roup
1089
Predilection site: Oesophagus, crop, proventriculus
Fig. 7.2 Trichomonas gallinae.
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trichomonadidae
Description: The body is elongate, ellipsoidal or pyriform, 5-19 × 2-9
μm, with four anterior flagella that arise from the blepharoplast (Fig. 7.2).
The undulating membrane does not reach the posterior end of the body
The axostyle is narrow, protrudes 2-8 μm from the body and its anterior
portion is flattened into a spatulate capitulum. There is a crescent-shaped
o od s    o i n  asx  mn  
emergence. The parabasal body is hook-shaped and has a parabasal
filament and the costa is a very fine rod running three quarters the length
of thebody.
Hosts: Pigeon, turkey, chicken, raptors (hawks, falcons, eagles)
Life cycle: The trichomonads reproduce by longitudinal binary fission. No
sexual stages areknown and there are no cysts.
1090
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Clinical signs: Severely affected birds lose weight, stand huddled with
uffled feathers, and may fall over when forced to move. Yellow, necrotic
lesions are present in the oesophagus and crop and a greenish fluid

caseous, necrotic masses that may occlude the lumen. The circumscribed
disk-shaped lesions are often described as ^yellow buttons'. The lesions in
the liver, lungs and other organs are solid, yellowish, caseous nodules up
to I cm or more in diameter.
Epidemiology: Turkeys and chickens are infected through drinking
contaminated water, the source of contamination being feral pigeons and
other wild birds, which also use the water source. Trichomonads enter the
water from the mouths, not the faeces, of the wild birds. T. gallinae has no
Treatment: Nitroimidazole compounds, such as dimetridazole and
metronidazole, are effective, but their availability has declined in many
countries through legislative changes and toxicity concerns.
Control: Control in chickens and turkeys, depends on preventing access
of wild pigeons to drinking water.
CROP
Gongylonema ingluvicola
Common name: Gullet worm
Predilection site: Crop, oesophagus and occasionally proventriculus
1091
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Long, slender worm. The female worm is 32-55 mm
long and the males measure around 18 mm.
Description, microscopic: Easily distinguished microscopically by the
presence of longitudinal rows of round or oval, cuticular bosses in the
anterior region of the body. The eggs measure approximately 58 × 35 μm.
Final hosts: Chicken, turkey, partridge, pheasant, quail
Intermediate hosts: Cockroaches (Blatella germanica) and beetles of the
species Copris minutus
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically spiruroid. Eggs are passed in faeces
and, when eaten by an intermediate host, they hatch and develop to the
infective stage within about 30 days. Infection of the definitive host is
through the ingestion of infected cockroaches. The adult worms live
spirally (in a zipper fashion) embedded in the mucosa or submucosa of the
crop with their anterior and/or posterior ends protruding into the lumen.
 The prepatent period is about 8 weeks.
Geographical distribution: North America, Asia, Africa, Australia and
Europe
Pathogenesis: The adult parasites are moderately pathogenic, depending
on the number of worms embedded in the epithelium.
Clinical signs: Light infections are often asymptomatic. Heavier
infections may produce regurgitation.
Diagnosis: Usually an incidental finding on postmortem.

cornification of the epithelium of the crop.
Gongylonema crami
Predilection site: Crop
Parasite class: Nematode
1092
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Final host: Chicken
Details are essentially similar to Gongylonema ing/uvicola
Trichomonasgallinae
See under Oesophagus.
Capillaria contorta
Synonym: Eucoleus contorta
Predilection site: Oesophagus, crop
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description: General description as for other Capillaria species. Males
measure around 12-17 mm and females 27-38 mm. Eggs are 48-56 x
21-24 μm.
Final hosts: Chicken, turkey, pheasant, partridge, duck and wild birds
Intermediatehosts:Earthworms.
Life cycle: C. contorta appears to be able to develop both directly and
indirectly. In the direct life cycle, the infective L1 develops within the egg
in about 3-4 weeks. Infection of the final host is through ingestion of this
embryonated infective stage, development to adult worms occurs without
a migration phase. In the indirect life cycle, the egg requires to be ingested
by an earthworm in which it hatches, the final host being infected by
ingestion of the earthworm. The prepatent period is about 3-4 weeks in
the final host.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
s       
causing some reduction in growth and lower egg production. Severely
infected birds often become anaemic, weak and emaciated.
1093
Pathology: Large numbers of worms produce an inflammation varying
from catarrhal to diphtheritic.
Epidemiology: Young birds are most susceptible to Capillaria infections
while adults may serve as carriers. C. contorta is important since, having a
direct life cycle, it occurs indoors in birds kept on deep litter and outdoors
         
ac cumulate.
Control: Control depends on regular anthelmintic treatment accompanied
if possible by moving the birds to fresh ground. Scrubbing and heat
treatment of affected surfaces is essential as is the provision of fresh litter
in chicken houses.
Details of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment are as for C.
annulata.

PROVENTRICULUS
Tetrameres americana
Synonym: Tropisurus americana
Common name: Globular roundworm
Predilection site: Proventriculus
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: The adults show sexual dimorphism. The males are
pale white, slender, and only about 5-6 mm long. The females are bright
red and almost spherical, with a diameter of about 3.5-5.0 mm (Fig. 7.3)
Description, microscopic: Males have spiny cuticles and no cordons;
females have four longitudinal deep furrows on the surface. Eggs are
thick-shelled, 42-50 x 24 μm and embryonated when passed.
1094
Final hosts: Chicken, turkey, duck, geese, grouse, quail, pigeon
Fig.7.3Adult female Tetrameresamericana.
Intermediate hosts: Cockroaches, grasshoppers and beetles
Life cycle: Eggs are shed with the faeces and hatch when eaten by an
intermediate host. The final host becomes infected following ingestion of
the intermediate host and the males and females locate in the glands of the
proventriculus. Males inhabit the mucosal surface and upper regions of the
glands but after mating the males leave the glands and die. The females
are embedded deep in the mucosal glands.
Geographical distribution: Commonly occurs in Africa and North
America
Pathogenesis: The females in the glands of the proventriculus are
bloodsuckers, and can cause anaemia as well as local erosion. Heavy
infections may be fatal in chicks, but this genus is usually present only in
moderate numbers and is well tolerated. The migration of juvenile stages
into the wall of the proventriculus can cause inflammation and thickening.
1095
Clinical signs: [nfected fowl may become anaemic and lose condition
Heavy infections, particularly in young chickens, can induce thickening of
the proventriculus with oedema and in some instances this can lead to
partial blockage of the lumen. Heavy infections can be fatal.
Diagnosis: At necropsy, the female Tetrameres appear as dark red spots
when viewed from the serosal surface of the proventriculus.
Pathology: The wall of the proventriculus may be thickened to an extent
that the lumen is almost obliterated.

Dispharynx nasuta
Common name: Spiral stomach worm
Synonym: Dispharynx spiralis, Acuaria spiralis
Predilection site: Oesophagus, proventriculus
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
1097
Description, gross: The body is slender and coiled, particularly the
posterior of the male. Males measure up to around 8 mm long and the
females 10 mm.
Description, microscopic: The cuticle is ornamented with four wavy
cordons that recurve anteriorly and do not fuse. The left spicule is slender
and the right spicule shorter and oval-shaped. The eggs are thick-shelled,
33-40 × 18-25 μm and embryonated when passed.
Final hosts: Chicken, turkey, pigeon, guinea fowl, grouse, pheasant and
other birds
Intermediate hosts: Various isopods such as sowbugs (Porceilio scaber)
and pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare)
Life cycle:  Typically  spiruroid. The intermediate host ingests
embryonated eggs and development to the L3 takes place in the body
cavity. When the isopod is consumed by the final host, the worms develop
to the final stage in the proventriculus or oesophagus.
Geographical distribution: Asia, Africa and the Americas
Pathogenesis: Mild infections usually provoke only a slight nodular
inflammatory reaction in the mucosa with excessive mucus production.
Clinical signs: Most mild infections with Dispharynx are inapparent.
Heavily infected young birds can rapidly lose weight, become emaciated
and anaemic. Deaths can be high.
Diagnosis: A tentative diagnosis is based on the presence of spiruroid
eggs, which are difficult to differentiate. Species identification is usually
based on morphological identification of adult worms on postmortem.
Pathology: In severe infections, deep ulcers and hypertrophy can occur in
the mucosa of the proventriculus in which the anterior ends of the worms
are embedded.
Echinuria uncinata
Synonym: Acuaria uncinata
Predilection site: Oesophagus, proventriculus, gizzard
1098
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: The body is slender and males measure 8-10 mm
long and the females 12-18.5 mm.
Description, microscopic: The cuticle is ornamented with four wavy
cordons that are non-recurrent and they anastomose in pairs. There are
four pairs of pre-cloacal papillae in two groups of two either side, and four
pairs of post-cloacal papillae. The left spicule is longer than the right
spicule. The eggs are thick-shelled, 37 × 20 μm and embryonated when
passed.
Final hosts: Duck, goose, swan and various aquatic birds
Intermediate hosts: Daphnia and Gammarus
by water fleas in which they hatch and develop to infective larvae. The
parasites continue development when the intermediate host is ingested by
an aquatic bird.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The worms can cause an inflammation of the alimentary
tract and the formation of caseous nodules. These nodules can be very
large in the gizzard and proventriculus and interfere with the passage of
poog
Clinical signs: Infected birds may become weak and emaciated and
deaths have been reported.
Hystrichis tricolour
Predilection site: Proventriculus, oesophagus
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Dioctophymatoidea
males 2.5 cm in length.
1099
Description, microscopic: The cephalic area is expanded, and possesses
many regularly positioned spines. The eggs are thick-shelled, coated with
tubercles and have truncated poles.
Final hosts: Domestic and wild ducks and anatid birds
Intermediate hosts: Oligochaetes (annelids)
Life cycle: This is indirect. Fowl and other birds become parasitised
through ingestion of infected oligochaetes. The adult worms are deeply
embedded in the mucosa with their caudal and cephalic regions lying
within the lumen of the tract. The prepatent period is around 2 weeks.
Geographical distribution: The extent of the distribution is not known
but it occurs occasionally in Europe
Pathogenesis: The parasite induces nodule formation (pea-sized tumours)
on the wall of the proventriculus and oesophagus. Sometimes these can
perforate to the pleural cavity.
Clinical signs: Low infections are usually asymptomatic but heavy
burdens can induce emaciation.
Eustrongyloides papillosus
Predilection site: Oesophagus, proventriculus
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Dioctophymatoidea
Description, gross: Females measure about 3 cm in length
          
margin. Eggs are 68 x 38 μm.
Final hosts: Duck, goose
Intermediate hosts: Not known, possible oligochaetes
Life cycle: This is not fully known but oligochaetes are likely to be
involved as intermediate hosts and various fish as paratenic hosts.
Geographical distribution: Many parts of the world
1100
Pathogenesis: Generally considered to be of low pathogenicity and of
little veterinary significance, although the parasites can induce the
formation of nodules in the wall of the anterior digestive tract.
Trichomonas gallinae
See under Oesophagus.
For treatment and control, see under Gizzard
GIZZARD
Several species of gizzard worms are found in ducks and geese. The
following applies to all species.
Life cycle: Direct and similar to other strongyles. Infection is via
ingestion of L3, or through skin penetration. Eggs passed in the faeces are
already embryonated and develop to the L3 in the egg. Ingested larvae
penetrate the submucosa of the gizzard. Patency is around 2-3 weeks in
geese.
       s  
the gizzard, may cause heavy mortality in goslings, ducklings and other
young aquatic fowls. Young goslings and ducklings are particularly
irritation and ingest blood.
Clinical signs: Young fowl may become inappetent, and show diarrhoea
and anaemia. Over time the birds become emaciated, weak and, where
signs but act as reservoirs of infection.
Diagnosis: At necropsy, worms may be recovered from the mucosa of the
gizzard following incubation in warm saline for 1-2 hours. Amidostomum
spp are the main trichostrongyloids of the gizzard, which possess a buccal
capsule.
Pathology: Severe infections induce haemorrhages on  the gizzard
mucosa, which may be accompanied by catarrhal inflammation. Heavy
1101
infections can cause necrosis of the horny lining of the gizzard, forming
reddish brown loose folds containing many embedded worms.
Epidemiology: The infective L3 requires adequate moisture, such as pond
margins, to survive, as they are very susceptible to desiccation.
Treatment: Treatment with one of the modern benzimidazoles or
levamisole, often administered in feed or drinking water, is effective
Control: Gizzard worm infection may be prevented by ensuring that birds
do not run on the same ground each year. It is important to restrict access
of wild aquatic fowl to areas where geese are raised.
Amidostomum anseris
Synonym: Amidostomum nodulosum
Common name: Gizzard worm
Predilection site: Gizzard, occasionally proventriculus, oesophagus
Parasite class: Nematoda

Description: Similar to A. anseris in possessing a shallow buccal capsule
before they are fully infective.
Hosts: Domestic and wild duck
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Epomidiostomum anatinum
Synonym:Epomidiostomum
uncinatum,
Strongyiusuncinatus,
Amidostomum anatinum
Common name: Gizzard worm
Predilection site: Gizzard
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The body is filiform with a very fine tapering anterior
region and yellowish white in colour. Males measure around 6 mm, and
females are approximately 10 mm in length.
Description, microscopic: The mouth is surrounded by four protruding
papillae. The cuticle bears two lateral epaulets, the posterior edge of
which forms a three-toothed fringe. The dark brown spicules are of equal
length and the tip comprises three branches. A gubernaculum is absent.
The tail of the female has a conical appendage with a small rounded tip.
Eggs measure about 80 × 50 μm.
Hosts: Domestic and wild goose, duck and other aquatic fowl
Geographical distribution: Many parts of the world, especially North
America,Africa,Asia and Europe
1103
Notes: A similar species, Epomidiostomum crami, is found in Canada
geese (Branta canadensis) and bluewinged geese (Chen coeruleus) in
North America.
Epomidiostomumorispinum
Synonym: Strongylus anseris, Strongylus orispinum.
Common name: Gizzard worm
Predilection site: Gizzard and oesophagus
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: Males measure around 11 mm and females 16 mm in
length.
Description, microscopic: The anterior of the worm possesses four
posteriorly pointing offshoots and lateral festoons bearing a pair of
of the female tapers abruptly, towards the digitate tail.
Hosts: Duck, goose and swan
Geographical distribution: Africa, Europe
Epomidiostomum skrjabini

the central lobe being poorly developed. Spicules are equal and the
 posterior ends are split into three sharp-tipped branches. The anterior ends
are blunt. The female tail terminates in a fingerlike appendage, which is
bent venterally.
Hosts: Domestic and wild goose
Geographical distribution: Russia
Cheilospirura hamulosa
Synonym: Acuaria hamulosa
Predilection site: Gizzard
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Spiruroidea
Description, gross: Males measure up to 15 mm and females 30 mm.
Description, microscopic: The worms have four wavy irregular cuticular
cordons that extend to more than half the length of the body. The males
have four pairs of pre-cloacal and six pairs of post-cloacal papillae, a short
flattened spicule on the right and a longer slender spicule on the left side.
Eggs are embryonated when passed.
Final hosts: Chicken, turkey
Intermediate hosts: Grasshoppers (Melanopius), weevils and beetles
Life cycle: Eggs shed in the faeces are ingested by the intermediate host
where they develop to the infective stage in about 3 weeks. The final host
becomes infected after consuming this intermediate host and the prepatent
period is about 3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, in particular Europe, Africa.
Asia and the Americas
Pathogenesis: Generally, mild to moderate infections are considered to be
of low pathogenicity. In heavy infections, many adult worms penetrate
under the keratinised layer of the gizzard where they are found embedded
1105
in soft orangy-coloured nodules. The keratinised layer of the gizzard may
become necrotic and rupture of the gizzard can occur.
Clinical signs: Mild infections are usually asymptomatic. Severe
infections can lead to emaciation, weakness and anaemia.
Diagnosis: This is best achieved through autopsy of an affected chicken,
as the eggs of several species of Cheilospirura appear very similar
Pathology: In mild infections, the worms are noticed only if the horny
lining of the gizzard is removed, and are found in soft, yellowish red
the worms found below the necrotic material within the altered
musculature of the gizzard.
Other species of spiruroid worms found in the gizzard are considered to be
of minor significance.

Ascaridia galli
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Description, gross: The worms are stout and densely white, the females
measuring up to 12.0 cm in length (Fig. 7.4). Ascaridia is by far the
largest nematode of poultry.
Description, microscopic: The egg is distinctly oval, with a smooth shell,
and cannot easily be distinguished from that of the other common poultry
ascaridoid, Heterakis.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey, goose, duck, guinea fowl and a number of wild

killed by a dry hot environment. The prepatent period ranges from 4-6
weeks in chicks to 8 weeks or more in adult birds. The worms live for
about l year.

1107
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Ascaridia is not a highly pathogenic worm, and any effects
are usually seen in young birds of around 1-2 months of age, adults
appearing relatively unaffected. The main effect is seen during the
prepatent phase, when the larvae are in the duodenal/intestinal mucosa.
There they cause enteritis, which is usually catarrhal, but in very heavy
infections may be haemorrhagic. In moderate infections the adult worms
are tolerated without clinical signs, but when considerable numbers are
present the large size of these worms may cause intestinal occlusion and
death. Nutritional deficiency may predispose birds to the establishment of
infection.
Clinical signs: Heavily infected birds may become anaemic and show
intermittent diarrhoea, anorexia, later becoming unthrifty and emaciated.
This can lead to a decrease in egg production.
Diagnosis: In infections with adult worms, the eggs will be found in
faeces, but since it is often difficult to distinguish these from the slightly
smaller eggs of Heterakis, confirmation must be made by postmortem
examination of a casualty when the large white worms will be found. In
the prepatent period, larvae will be found in the intestinal contents and in
scrapings of the mucosa.
numbers of young parasites penetrate the duodenal or jejunal mucosa. The
1108
embedded larvae cause haemorrhage and extensive destruction of the
glandular epithelium, and proliferation of mucous-secretory cells may
result in adhesion of the mucosal villi. Damage to the epithelia may not
only be caused by the larvae, but also by the adult worms in the form of
pressure atrophy of the villi with occasional necrosis of the mucosal layer.
In chronic infections a loss of muscle tonus may be seen, and the intestinal
wall may assume a flabby appearance. During the histotropic phase, there
distended with urates.
Epidemiology: Adult birds are symptomless carriers, and the reservoir of
infection is on the ground, either as free eggs or in earthworm transport
hosts. Infection is heaviest in young chicks.
Treatment:  Treatment with piperazine salts, levamisole or a
benzimidazole, such as flubendazole, mebendazole or fenbendazole, can
be administered in the feed (30 ppm over 7 days; 60 ppm over 7 days; 60
orally, or 300 ppm in the feed.
Control: When birds are reared on a free-range system, and ascaridiosis is
a problem, the young birds should, if possible, be segregated and reared

advisable. Since the nematode may also be a problem in deep litter houses,
feeding and watering systems which will limit the contamination of food
and water by faeces, should be used

earthworms, which may act as transport hosts. The prepatent period is 6
weeks.
Geographical distribution: Presumed worldwide
Pathogenesis: Considered non-pathogenic
Diagnosis: Adult worms may be found in the intestine on postmortem or
the characteristic ascarid eggs may be seen in faeces.
Pathology: No associated pathology
Epidemiology: Adult birds are symptomless carriers, and the reservoir of
infection is on the ground, either as free eggs or in earthworm transport
hosts.
Treatment: Not usually required, although treatment with piperazine
salts, levamisole or a benzimidazole, such as fenbendazole, is effective.
Control: Strict hygiene and feeding and watering systems, which will
limit the contamination of food and water by faeces, should be used

Occurs without a migration phase. The prepatent period is around 3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: C. obsignata can be highly pathogenic in chickens and
pigeons, leading to mortalities. Birds become listless, emaciated and
diarrhoeic.
Epidemiology: Young birds are most susceptible to Capillaria infections
while adults may serve as carriers. C. obsignata is important since, having
a direct life cycle, it occurs indoors in birds kept on deep litter and
outdoors in free-range systems, allowing large numbers of infective eggs
to accumulate.

ingested by a termite, develop to the infective stage in the body cavity.
Following ingestion of an infected intermediate host the larvae develop to
maturity in the final host in about 3 weeks
Geographical distribution: Widespread in Europe, Africa and Asia. It is
not found in the New World
Pathogenesis: Infections are rarely fatal, but when large numbers of
worms are present there may be inflammation of the intestine.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea and emaciation may occur, often accompanied
by a decrease in egg production.
Diagnosis: Differentiation of eggs in faeces is difficult as they are
morphologically similar to those of other poultry spiruroids. Diagnosis is
usually confirmed at necropsy.
Treatment: Not reported
Control: Where feasible, removal of termite nests from areas adjacent to
runs used for poultry will be beneficial.
Tapeworms
Tapeworms are a feature of poultry which are reared on pasture, infection
being acquired through ingestion of infected intermediate hosts, such as
beetles, earthworms, ants, grasshoppers or flies. Infection is uncommon in
intensive indoor systems as suitable intermediate hosts are usually absent.
The most important and pathogenic species is Davainea proglottina which
penetrates the duodenal mucosa and in young birds can induce a necrotic
haemorrhagic enteritis which can be fatal.Railfientina echinobothrida is
also pathogenic, inducing a hyperplastic enteritis and multiple caseous
nodules where the scolex attaches to the wall of the intestine. Many other
tapeworm species produce only mild symptoms, unless infections are
heavy, when loss of productivity may be seen. Effective treatment of
avian tapeworms is achieved with praziquantel, flubendazole,
mebendazole, febantel or niclosamide. The dose rate and duration of
administration varies between species of poultry. Control depends on the
or removal of intermediate hosts where possible.
1114

Final hosts: Chicken, turkey, pigeon and other gallinaceous birds
Intermediate hosts: Gastropod molluscs such as Agriolimax, Arion,
Cepaea and Limax
Life cycle: Gravid proglottids are shed in faeces and eggs are ingested by
various gastropod molluscs, in which they develop to the cysticercoid
stage after about 3 weeks. Following ingestion of the mollusc by the final
host, the cysticercoids develop into adult tapeworms in about 2 weeks.

doubly armed scolex penetrating deeply between the duodenal villi. Heavy
infections may cause haemorrhagic enteritis, and light infections retarded
growth and weakness.
Clinical signs: Moderate infections can lead to reduced weight gain,
innapetance and lowered egg production. Large numbers of parasites may
induce emaciation, dyspnoea and even be fatal.
Diagnosis: This is best achieved at necropsy through microscopic
examination of mucosal scrapings from the duodenum and anterior small
intestine. The tapeworm can easily be overlooked due to its minute size.
Pathology: The mucosal membranes are thickened and haemorrhagic with
localised patches of necrosis. Fetid mucus may be present.
Epidemiology: Infection can be common in free-range fowl as suitable
intermediate hosts are often available. Young birds tend to be more
severely affected than older fowl.

Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, Tenebrionidae, and the meal beetles, Tribolium
spp.
Life cycle: Gravid proglottids are passed in faeces and eggs are ingested
by various intermediate hosts. The embryo hatches from the egg in the
intestine and then changes into a cysticercoid in the body cavity.
Following ingestion by the final host the activated cysticercoid attaches to
the mucosa of the anterior or mid small intestine. The prepatent period is
around 2-3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Heavy infections can induce a catarrhal enteritis
Clinical signs: Reduction in growth rate. Heavy infection can lead to
emaciation and weakness.
Diagnosis: This is best achieved at necropsy through microscopic
examination of mucosal scrapings from the small intestine.
Pathology: In heavy infections, the embedded scolices of this parasite can
produce caseous nodules in the wall of the small intestine.
Epidemiology: Young birds are usually more susceptible to infection than
adults. Infection rates depend on the availability of the intermediate hosts.
Beetles are numerous for free-range fowl but some beetles may also breed
in litter bedding. Eggs are reasonably resistant to environmental
conditions and will survive for several months.

Intestinal flukes
Intestinal flukes are found in both the small and large intestines. The
majority of avian intestinal trematodes parasitise aquatic fowl and birds
and are of importance where birds forage in habitats that support the snail
intermediate hosts.
Eggs passed in the faeces of infected birds hatch to produce a miracidium,
which infects the first intermediate snail host. Subsequently cercariae
encyst within the snail or are shed and migrate to infect other snails.
Cercariae can also encyst in the kidneys of tadpoles and adult frogs. The
final host is parasitised by ingesting the infected second intermediate host.
The prepatent period is 1-2 weeks.
Large numbers of flukes can irritate the intestinal mucosa inducing a
catarrhal, haemorrhagic enteritis and diarrhoea. Young birds are
1123
particularly susceptible to infection, showing progressive emaciation, and
mortalities can be high. Various anthelmintics are available for treatment.

Coccidiosis in chickens
Seven species of Eimeria have been identified in chickens; identification
is based on location in the intestine and associated pathology. Specific
identification is based on the nature and location of the lesions in the
intestine together with careful examination  of fresh smears  for  the
recognition of the development stages of the parasite.
1127
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is best based on postmortem examination of a few affected
birds. This can be made at microscopic level, either by examining the
faeces for the presence of oocysts or by examination of scrapings or
histological sections of affected tissues. Although oocysts may be detected
on faecal examination, it would be wrong to diagnose solely on such
evidence for two reasons. First, the major pathogenic effect usually occurs
prior to oocyst production, and secondly, depending on the species
involved, the presence of large numbers of oocysts is not necessarily
correlated with severe pathological changes in the gut. At necropsy, the
location and type of lesions present provide a good guide to the species
that can be confirmed by examination of the oocysts in the faeces and the
meronts and oocysts present in scrapings of the gut. A reliable species
diagnosis based on oocyst morphology is not possible as the dimensions
and other features overlap between species (see Table 15.11).

Species diagnosis is based on a combination of characteristics, including
site of development in the intestinal tract, the type of macroscopic lesions
and size of meronts in mucosal smears. The mature meronts may be
identified histologically by their location, size and the number of
merozoites they contain.
Epidemiology
The appearance and development of coccidiosis infections in poultry
houses is dependent on a complex interplay of many factors. In fresh litter,
1128
few coccidia are present and there may be only a few oocysts scattered
around. From the moment a few chicks are infected, rapid multiplication
commences and a week later, new oocysts are excreted in large quantities
The infection usually begins to spread at full rate around the third or
fourth week after housing. As exposure and immunity increases, the
chicks will then gradually recover and withstand the infection. Rearing of
thousands of birds on litter-covered floors in enormous houses may result
in a tremendous and dangerous buildup of the oocyst population. Whether
or not infection leads to the occurrence of disease outbreaks is to a great
Serious outbreaks of clinical coccidiosis with acute mortality are,
however, highly exceptional in modern broiler farms because of the
stringent monitoring and control measures employed. Where outbreaks do
occur, clinical signs can be ascribed to one, or a combination of two or
rarely three coccidial species. Management-related factors, such as
stocking density, size of the farm, period of vacancy, quality of the litter,
inadequate cleaning, ventilation system, presence of animals of different
ages and what anticoccidials are used, will play an important part in
influencing the numbers of oocysts that birds will be exposed to, and
whether and to what extent the coccidiosis will develop. The occurrence

immunity and the interference of other diseases. The damaging nature and
the location of the coccidia in the intestine will differ to such an extent
that ultimately a complex and unique picture will develop on individual
poultry farms. A change from litter-covered floors to wire-floored pens
greatly reduces the exposure to coccidia. Outbreaks of coccidiosis in
laying hens maintained in cages rarely occur. In general, the prophylactic
use of anticoccidial drugs is not required if the cages are kept clean and
the faeces do not contaminate watering and feeding systems.
Oocysts are disseminated via the faeces and the litter, with dust within the
poultry buildings, inside and outside the house by invertebrates and
vermin, whilst mechanical ventilation systems serve to scatter the oocysts
outside the house. Faecal contamination of vehicles and personnel can
spread the infection to other farms. Measures, such as thorough cleaning
and disinfecting with oocidal agents, batch depopulation between
grow-outs and admitting as few visitors as possible, are essential in order
to maintain proper hygiene standards. Today most poultry enterprises rely
1129
on floor-rearing methods for broiler production or breeder flocks and use
continuous medication programmes. Poultry producers also attempt to
control coccidiosis by employing good sanitary programmes. Litters
should be kept dry so that oocysts cannot sporulate. Wet litter must be
cleaned out and replaced with dry litter. When broiler houses are emptied
for a new batch of chickens the litter should be piled up for about 24 hours
is usually impractical since oocysts are resistant to disinfectants used
against bacteria, viruses or fungi.
Treatment
This should be introduced as early as possible after a diagnosis has been
made. Sulphonamide drugs have been the most widely used and it is
water, with an interval of 2 days between treatments. Where resistance has
occurred to sulphonamides, mixtures of amprolium and ethopabate have
given good results. Toltrazuril has been introduced for the treatment of
outbreaks of coccidiosis and its use is restricted to where other treatments
have been ineffective.
In the successful treatment of an outbreak of coccidiosis the aim is to treat
birds already affected and at the same time allow sufficient merogonous
development in the clinically unaffected birds to stimulate their resistance.
Control
Prevention of avian coccidiosis is based on a combination of good
management and the use of anticoccidial compounds in the feed or water.
Thus, litter should always be kept dry and special attention given to litter
near water fonts or feeding troughs. Fonts that prevent water reaching the
over the droppings pit. Feeding and watering utensils should be of such a
will also reduce the humidity in the house and help to keep litter dry.
Preferably, clean litter should always be provided between batches of
birds. If this is not possible, the litter should be heaped and left for 24
hours after it has reached a temperature of 50°C; it should then be forked
over again and the process repeated to ensure that all the oocysts in the
litter have been destroyed.
1130
The use of anti-coccidial agents depends on the type of management
concerned. Broiler chicks are on lifetime-medicated  feed and  the
anticoccidials used are maintained at a level sufficient to prevent
merogony. The drugs available for use singly or in various combinations
are amprolium, clopidol, diclazuril, ethopabate, halofuginone, lasalocid.
maduramicin, monensin, narasin, nicarbazin, robenidine, salinomycin and
sulphaquinoxaline. It is recommended that drugs are switched between
batches of broilers, the so-called ‘rotation programme', or within the
lifespan of each batch, the ‘shuttle programme'. Most drugs have a
 s          n
be slaughtered for human consumption. This is usually 5-7 days.
Where replacement laying birds spend their whole life on wire floors, no
medication is necessary; if they are reared on litter, for eventual
production on wire, then a full level of coccidiostat is given as for broilers.
If they are reared on litter, for production on litter, then a programme of
anti-coccidials designed to stimulate immunity is used.Preparations
frequently used either singly, or in combination, are amprolium,
ethopabate, lasalocid, monensin and sulphaquinoxaline. The procedure is
to administer these drugs in a decreasing level over the first 16 or 18
weeks of life. This may be done as a two-stage reduction, i.e. between 0
and 8 weeks and 8 and 16 weeks, or, alternatively, as a three-stage
reduction, from 0-6 weeks, 6-12 weeks and 12-18 weeks. Using this
in the very young birds and the reduced drug rate in older birds allows
develop.
When in-feed coccidiostats are used, there are two further factors to
consider. First, outbreaks of coccidiosis may occur in birds on medicated
feed either because the level of coccidiostat used is too low or because
conditions in the house have changed to allow a massive sporulation of
oocysts, which, on ingestion, the level of drug can no longer control.
Secondly, the influence of intercurrent infections in affecting appetite, and
therefore uptake of coccidiostat, should also be considered.
In the USA, a live ‘vaccine’ consisting of oocysts of eight species of
coccidia is commercially available. Young chicks are given the vaccine in
the drinking water, and 10 days later a coccidiostat is introduced into the
1131
feed for a period of 3-4 weeks. Successful immunisation has also been
achieved with oocysts attenuated by irradiation.
A live, attenuated, oral vaccine is available, as an alternative to
coccidiostats, for the control of coccidiosis in chickens. This consists of
selected ^precocious’ strains of each of the pathogenic species of coccidia
that affect poultry; these strains show rapid development in vivo with
minimal damage to the intestine but stimulate an effective immunity. For
boost immunity and this may not occur unless litter is sufficiently moist to
allow sporulation. There is considerable interest in developing more
efficient vaccines, in view of the increasing problem of drug resistance in
coccidiosis. Various other vaccines have also become available in several
countries using either live or attenuated strains of coccidia.
Intestinal coccidiosis
This form of the disease tends to be chronic and may be associated with
several species of Eimeria. Mortality may not be heavy but morbidity may
retard growth significantly. Usually more than one species is present.
Specific identification is based on the nature and location of the lesions in
the intestine together with careful examination of fresh smears for the
recognition of the development stages of the parasite.
Eimeria acervulina
Predilection site: Duodenum (Fig. 7.7)
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Fig. 7.7 Predilection site of Eimeria acervulina.
1132
Description: Oocysts are 0void, smooth 12-23 × 9-17 μm (mean 18 × 14
μm), without a micropyle or residuum but with a polar granule. The
sporocysts are ovoid, with a Stieda body and without a residuum.
First-generation meronts are 9-11 μm long and mature in 36-48 hours to
produce 8-16 merozoites  with a small residuum.  Second-generation

residuum; third-generation meronts mature 56-72 hours after inoculation
to produce eight merozoites with a residuum and  fourth-generation
meronts mature 80-96 hours after inoculation and produce 32 merozoites
with a large residuum. The macrogamonts are 14.5-19 μm in diameter,
1133
and the microgamonts 7-8 μm. The latter produce many tri-flagellate
microgametes 2-3 μm long.
Hosts: Chicken
Life cycle: The sporocysts emerge from the oocysts in the gizzard and the
sporozoites are activated and emerge in the small intestine. Most enter the
duodenum. The meronts are found in the epithelial cells of the villi of the
anterior small intestine where they lie above the host nucleus. There are
four merogony generations. The first-generation meronts lie at the base of
the glands of the crypts of the duodenum.
Fig. 7.8 Duodenal lesions of Eimeria acervulina.
Second-generation meronts are found at  the neck of the glands,
third-generation meronts lie at the base of the villi and fourth-generation
meronts lie on the sides and the tips of the villi. The sexual stages are
found above the host cell nuclei, in the epithelial cells of the villi and to a
lesser extent in the gland cells, and are seen 4 days after infection and take
40 hours to mature. The prepatent period is 89 hours. The sporulation time
is 24 hours.

weight gains but little mortality. Clinical disease occurs about 3 days
following the ingestion of large numbers of oocysts.
Clinical signs: E. acervulina is generally considered to be moderately
pathogenic, and heavy infections can cause severe signs and death.
1134
Symptoms include diarrhoea, dejection, ruffled feathers and drooping
wings, inappetence, weight loss and depressed weight gain.
Pathology: The lesions in light infections consist of white transverse
streaks in the duodenum and upper small intestine (Fig. 7.8). In heavier
infections the lesions coalesce and the intestinal wall becomes thickened
and congested with marked whitish mucoid exudate. Very large numbers
of the characteristic small ovoid oocysts can be seen in smears from the
duodenum and on histopathology (Fig. 7.9)
Lesions are scored +1 to + 4 as follows
1. Scattered, white plaque-like lesions containing developing
0ocysts confined to the duodenum. These lesions are elongated with
the longer axis transversely orientated on the thickened intestinal
walls like the rungs of a ladder. They may be seen from either the
serosal or mucosal intestinal surfaces. The birds would not be
affected clinically and weight gains would not be affected.
extend below the duodenum in young birds. The intestinal walls are
not thickened and the gut contents are normal. The birds would
show a depression in weight gain.
3. The lesions are clearly recognisable from the mucosal and serosal
surfaces, are more numerous and beginning to coalesce. The
intestinal wall is thickened and the intestinal contents are watery
due to excessive mucus secretion. The birds have diarrhoea, and
their weight gains are decreased.
4. The mucosal wall is greyish with colonies completely coalesced
In extremely heavy infections the entire mucosa may be bright red
in colour. Individual lesions may be indistinguishable in the upper
intestine. Typical ladder-like lesions appear in the middle part of the
intestine. The intestinal wall is very much thickened, and the
intestine is filled with a creamy exudate, which may contain
numbers of oocysts. The birds show diarrhoea, severe weight loss,
poor feed conversion and skin de-pigmentation.

Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are 0void, smooth 14-34 × 12-26 μm (mean 26 x
22 μm), without a micropyle or residuum but with a polar granule. The
sporocysts are ovoid (13 × 7.5 μm), with a Stieda body and a sporocyst
merozoites. Second-generation meronts are smaller than first-generation
meronts and contain 15-120 merozoites. The microgamonts contain
severalcentres of microgamete development and are larger than the
macrogamonts, which are 25 × 22 μm.
1137
Host: Chicken
Life cycle: The first-generation meronts are found in the epithelial cells in
the base of the villi in the mid intestine. There are at least three merogony
generations. Second-generation meronts are found subepithelially at the
tips of the villi in the lower small intestine 3 days post infection.
Third-generation meronts are first seen at 84 hours, and mature by 4 days
after infection and are located in the lower small intestine and large
intestine. Gamonts are seen from day 5 at the tips and sides of the villi in
the lower small intestine and large intestine, either above the host cell
nuclei or on the basement membrane. The prepatent period is 120
hours.The sporulation time is 24—48 hours.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The pathogenicity of this species is high but mortality is
variable. Lesions are most pronounced in the posterior small intestine.
Clinical signs: E. brunetti is markedly pathogenic, but its effects depend
on the degree of infection. Light infections may be asymptomatic. Heavier
infections reduce weight gain or cause weight loss. The birds develop
fluid droppings containing blood-tinged mucus and mucous casts. The
birds become depressed and deaths may occur. The symptoms continue
for 5 days before recovery.
Pathology: The gut wall becomes thickened and a pink or blood-tinged
catarrhal exudate appears 4-5 days after experimental inoculation. In early
or light infections, haemorrhagic, ladder-like streaks are present on the
mucosa of the lower small intestine and rectum. In heavy infections, a
characteristic necrotic enteritis appears that may involve the entire
intestinal tract, but which is more usually found in the lower small
intestine, colon and tubular part of the caeca (Fig. 7.11). A patchy 0r
continuous dry, caseous, necrotic membrane may line the intestine, and
the intestine may be filled with sloughed, necrotic material. Circumscribed
white patches may be visible through the serosa and there may be
intestinal perforation with resultant peritonitis.
Lesions are scored +1 to + 4 as follows
1. Gross lesions are very distinct with some greying and reddening
of the mucosal surfaces with a few petechiae visible from the
serosal surface, appearing as pits on the mucosal surface.
1138
2. Intestinal wall may appear grey in colour and the lower portion
may be thickened with flecks of pinkish material sloughed from the
intestine. More petechiae are present, with the greatest number
appearing on day 5 after infection. They may appear as early as day
3.5 and occur from the yolk stalk posteriorly. Mild mucosal
roughening can be detected by feel.
3. Intestinal wall thickened, and a blood-tinged exudate is present.
Transverse streaks may be present in the lower rectum with lesions
in the caecal tonsils. Weight gains and feed conversion are reduced.
4. Severe coagulative necrosis of the lower intestine can result in
erosion of the entire mucosa. This is apparent as a thickening of the
intestine wall and in some birds a dry necrotic membrane may line
the intestine (pseudomembranous necrosis) and caseous cores may
plug the caeca. Lesions may extend into the middle or upper
intestine and the necrosis may be severe enough to cause intestinal
obstruction and death of the bird.

without a residuum. The sporozoites are 19 x 4 μm and each has a
conspicuous clear globule.
Host: Chicken
Life cycle: The meronts are located above the host cell nuclei (or
occasionally beside them) in the epithelial cells of the tips of the villi of
the duodenum and upper ileum. There are three asexual generations. The
first-generation meronts lie deep in the epithelial cells of the deep glands
of the duodenum. They appear 48 hours after inoculation and contain
25-50 loosely packed merozoites. The second-generation meronts are in
the epithelial cells of the small intestine villi near the openings of the
crypts appearing on the third day after infection and produce about 12
merozoites. Third-generation meronts are in the epithelial cells along the
sides of the superficial villi and sometimes near the tips, appearing during
the fourth day after infection and produce about 12 merozoites. Gamonts
are located below the host cell nuclei and as they enlarge, the host cells
are displaced towards the centre of the villi and come to lie in their
interior. After fertilisation, an oocyst wall is laid down and the oocysts
break out of the villi and are passed in the faeces. The prepatent period is
120 hours. Sporulation time is 30-48 hours.

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Strains of E. maxima differ in their pathogenicity, which
           
morbidity, and mortality may approach 25%. Lesions occur most
frequently in the mid small intestine although the whole of the small
intestine may be involved. Clinical disease occurs about 3 days following
the ingestion of large numbers of oocysts. Asexual stages cause relatively
little damage, with the most serious effects being due to the sexual stages.

The sporocysts are 0void, 10-16 μm, with a Stieda body and without a
residuum. Merogony stages have not been described. The microgamonts
are 9-14 μm in diameter, and the microgamonts somewhat larger.
Host: Chicken
Life cycle: The endogenous stages are in the epithelial cells of the villi
and occasionally in the crypts of the small intestine; also caeca and

sporulation time is 18-24 hours.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: No discrete lesions are produced with this species, but
infection can cause loss in body weight gain.
Clinical signs: Generally, older chickens are affected by the species found
in the small intestine, and clinical signs are similar to those of caecal
coccidiosis. Subclinical infections are more common than overt disease
and may be suspected when pullets have poor rates of growth and feed
conversion, and the onset of egg laying is delayed.

Host: Chicken
Life cycle: Following ingestion of sporulated oocysts, and excystation,
sporozoites enter the epithelial cells of the small intestine, pass through
the epithelium into the lamina propria at the centre of the villi, and migrate
towards the muscularis mucosae. Many sporozoites are engulfed by
 macrophages during this passage, and are transported to the epithelial cells
of the fundus. The macrophages invade these cells and appear to
disintegrate leaving the sporozoites unharmed. The sporozoites round up
    n    s i  
epithelial cells of the crypts of the small intestine. Second-generation
meronts develop deep in the mucosa. The prepatent period is 138 hours
and the patent period is about 12 days. Sporulation time is 18-24 hours.

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: E. necatrix is one of the most pathogenic species of
coccidia affecting chickens.
Clinical signs: Symptoms seen include diarrhoea (mucoid and sometimes
bloody), dejection, ruffled feathers and drooping wings, inappetence,
weight loss and depressed weight gain. Death usually occurs 5-7 days
1146
Pathology: The principal lesions are in the small intestine, especially the
middle third. Small, white opaque foci are seen by the fourth day after
infection. These are the second-generation meronts, and they are often so
Severe haemorrhage may occur by day 5 or 6 and the small intestine may
be markedly swollen and filled with clotted or unclotted blood. The wall is
thickened, dull red and petechiae are present in the white foci as a result of
release of the second-generation merozoites (Fig. 7.16). The gut wall may
lose its contractility, become friable, and the epithelium may slough and
be replaced by a network of fibrin-containing mononuclear cells. This
which interferes with intestinal absorption.

Coccidiosis in turkeys
Seven species of Eimeria have been identified in turkeys; identification is
  d s  s     
Specific identification is based on the nature and location of the lesions in
the intestine together with careful examination of fresh smears for the
recognition of the development stages of the parasite.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is best based on postmortem examination of a few affected
birds. The oocysts may be identified according to shape and size. At
necropsy, the location and type of lesions present provide a good guide to
the species, which can be confirmed by examination of the oocysts in the
faeces and the meronts and oocysts present in scrapings of the gut.
Epidemiology
The appearance and development of coccidiosis is similar to that
described for chickens. Acute infections with pathogenic species occur in
young turkey poults 2-10 weeks of age, causing enteritis with variable
mortality. Deep-litter houses offer optimal conditions of temperature and
humidity for oocyst sporulation, and with overcrowding the risk of heavy
infection is further increased.

Treatment
Anticoccidial drugs, such as lasolocid, monensin, robenidine, amprolium.
ethopabate and clopidol/methylbenzoquate, can be used for prophylaxis
by incorporating in the feed for the first 12-16 weeks oflife. Low doses of
anticoccidial drugs can be used to allow immunity to develop, particularly
in breeding birds. Monensin should be used under veterinary guidance
Control
Prevention of turkey coccidiosis is based on a combination of good
management and the use of anticoccidial compounds in the feed or water.
Thus, litter should always be kept dry and special attention given to litter
near water fonts or feeding troughs. Drinkers that prevent water reaching
the litter should always be used and they should be placed on drip trays or
over the droppings pit. Feeding and watering utensils should be of such a
type and height that droppings cannot contaminate them. Good ventilation
will also reduce the humidity in the house and help to keep litter dry.
Preferably, clean litter should always be provided between batches of

When in-feed coccidiostats are used, there are two further factors to
consider. First, outbreaks of coccidiosis may occur in birds on medicated
feed either because the level of coccidiostat used is too low or because
conditions in the house have changed to allow a massive sporulation of
1151
oocysts, which, on ingestion, the level of drug can no longer control.
Secondly, the influence of intercurrent infections in affecting appetite, and
therefore uptake of coccidiostat, should also be considered.
Intestinal coccidiosis
As with coccidiosis in chickens more than one species is usually present in
outbreaks of disease. Specific identification is based on the nature and
location of the lesions in the intestine together with careful examination of
fresh smears for the recognition of the development stages of the parasite.
Eimeriaadenoides
Predilection site: Lower small intestine and caeca
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal or ovoid, smooth, colourless 19-31 x
13-21 μm (mean 26 x 17 μm), with a micropyle, 0ne to three polar
granules but with no oocyst residuum. The sporocysts are elongate, with a
Stieda body and a residuum and contain a clear globule at the large end.
First-generation meronts are 30 × 18 μm when mature (after 30 hours) and
contain approximately 700 merozoites, 4-7 x 1.5 μm, with a central
nucleus. Second-generation meronts are 10 x 10 μm and produce 12-24
merozoites, 10 × 3 μm, with the nucleus slightly nearer the rounded end.
The mature macrogamonts and microgamonts are 20 × 18 μm.
Host:Turkey
Life cycle: E. adenoides is found in the lower small intestine, caecae and
rectum and has two generations of meronts. First-generation meronts can
be seen in the epithelial cells as early as 6 hours after inoculation.
Second-generation meronts mature 96-108 hours after inoculation. Sexual
stages can be detected as early as 120 hours post infection. The prepatent
period is 104-132 hours and the patent period 7-20 days. Sporulation time
is 24 hours.

Pathogenesis: E. adenoides is one of the most pathogenic species of
coincident with the rupture of the second-stage meronts. Initially the
intestines appear grossly normal until this point; thereafter, the walls of
the lower third of the small intestine, caecae and rectum become swollen
and oedematous, with petechial haemorrhages visible from the mucosal
surface only. The lower intestine becomes filled with mucus. The infected
epithelial cells break away, leaving the villi denuded. The blood vessels
become engorged  and  cellular infiltration of the submucosa and
epithelium increases progressively. In birds that recover from the disease,
and in those that received a low infection, resolution is rapid. Vascularity
is greatly reduced and the deep glands are almost free of parasites by the
7th day. The intestine is almost normal by the 9th or 1oth day post
infection.
Clinical signs: The affected poults are dull, listless, anorexic, stand with
ruffled feathers and have their heads tucked under their wings. Their
droppings are white and mucoid and may contain blood. Heavy infections
can result in mortality.
Pathology: Most of the terminal intestine is congested and contains large
numbers of merozoites and long streaks of blood. Caseous material,
composed of cellular debris, gametes and a few immature oocysts,
accumulates. With time, the caseous exudate is composed largely of
oocysts. The faeces in severe cases are relatively fluid and may be
blood-tinged and contain mucous casts 2.5-5 cm long. Caseous plugs may
be present in the caecae. The terminal intestine may contain creamy white
mucus, and petechiae may be present in the mucosa. As recovery
proceeds, the intestinal contents appear normal but still contain large
numbers of oocysts.
Eimeria dispersa
Predilection site: Duodenum and upper small intestine Parasite class:
Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeridae
Description: Oocysts are ovoid, smooth, 22-31 x 18-24 μm (mean 26 x
21 μm), with no micropyle, polar granule or oocyst residuum. Sporocysts
are ovoid and have a Stieda body.
1153
First-generation meronts are 14 x 13 μm and contain an average of 19
merozoites; second-generation meronts are 8 x 7 μm and contain an
average of 13.5 merozoites; third-generation are 9 x 9 μm and contain an
average of 15 merozoites; whilst fourth-generation meronts are 12 × 10.5
μm and contain an average of seven merozoites. Mature macrogametes are
18-20 μm in diameter, with microgamonts slightly smaller.
Host: Turkey
Life cycle: First-, second-, third- and fourth-generation meronts are
present 30, 48, 72 and 96 hours after infection respectively. Sporozoites
and first-generation meronts lie close above the epithelial cell nuclei;
second-, third- and fourth-generation meronts are also above the host cell
nucleus, but lie near the brush border of the host cell. The mature macro-
and microgamonts can be found in the small intestine villar epithelial cells
96 hours after infection. The prepatent period is 120-144 hours. Oocyst
sporulation time is 48 hours.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: A mildly pathogenic species that produces creamy, mucoid
exudates in the small intestine of young turkeys and depressed weight
gains.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea, weight loss, ruffled feathers, droopiness and
growth retardation
Pathology: With pathogenic strains, the most severe lesions occur 5-6
days after infection. The entire small intestine is markedly dilated, and the
duodenum and anterior jejunum are creamy white when seen through the
serosal surface. The anterior half of the small intestine is filled with
creamy, yellowish, sticky, mucoid material. The wall of the anterior
intestine is oedematous, but there is little epithelial sloughing. Recovery is
rapid and the intestine appears virtually normal 8 days post infection.
Eimeria gallopavonis
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
1154
Description: Oocysts are 0void, smooth, 22-31 × 18-24 μm (mean 26 x
21 μm), with no micropyle, polar granule or oocyst residuum. Sporocysts
are ovoid and have a Stieda body.
First-generation meronts are 14 x 13 μm and contain an average of 19
merozoites; second-generation meronts are 8 × 7 μm and contain an
average of 13.5 merozoites; third-generation are 9 × 9 μm and contain an
average of 15 merozoites; whilst fourth-generation meronts are 12 × 10.5
μm and contain an average of seven merozoites. Mature macrogametes are
18-20 μm in diameter with microgamonts slightly smaller.
Host:Turkey
Life cycle: Endogenous stages occur in the epithelial cells at the tips of
the villi lying above the host cell nucleus. The first-generation meronts
occur in the ileum and rectum. There appear to be two sizes of
second-generation meronts, with smaller ones occurring in the rectum and
ileum, more rarely the caeca, and larger ones only in the rectum. A few
third-generation meronts are found in the rectum producing 1o-12
merozoites. These and second-generation meronts develop into gamonts
found primarily in the rectum and occasionally, the ileum and caeca. The
prepatent period is 144 hours. Oocyst sporulation time is 24 hours.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Reported to be moderately pathogenic
Clinical signs: Watery or mucoid diarrhoea, depression, ruffled feathers.
anorexia
Pathology: This species is found in the ileum, rectum and less commonly
the caeca. The intestine is inflamed and oedematous with soft white
caseous material in the lumen.
Eimeria meleagrimitis
Predilection site: Duodenum
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
1155
Description: Oocysts are subspherical, smooth, colourless 16-27 × 13-22
μm (mean 19 × 16 μm), with no micropyle or oocyst residuum, but with
one to three polar granules. The sporocysts are ovoid, with a Stieda body
and a residuum and contain a clear globule at the large end
First-generation meronts are 17 x 13 μm when mature (after 48 hours) and
contain approximately 80-100 merozoites, 4.5 × 1.5 μm, with a nucleus at
the larger end. Second-generation meronts are 8 × 7 μm and produce 8-16
merozoites, 7 x 1.5 μm, with the nucleus slightly near the centre
Third-generation meronts are the same size as the second-generation
meronts but differ in possessing a residuum and have a nucleus nearer the
large end. The mature macrogamonts and microgamonts are 15 × 1l μm
and the macrogamonts contain a residuum.
Host:Turkey
Life cycle: The sporocysts emerge from the oocysts in the gizzard and the
intestine. The sporozoites invade the tips of the villi and migrate down the
villi in the lamina propria until they reach the glands. First-generation
meronts can be found in the gland epithelial cells as early as 12 hours after
infection and are mature by 48 hours. The first-generation merozoites
invade the adjacent epithelial cells forming colonies of second-generation
meronts that mature at about 66 hours after infection. Third-generation
meronts may appear as early as 72 hours after inoculation and are mature
by 96 hours. Macrogametes and microgamonts appear 114 hours after
infection. The prepatent period is 144 hours. Oocyst sporulation time is
24-72 hours.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: E. meleagrimitis is moderately to markedly pathogenic and
has three generations of merogony with disease occurring following the
rupture of the third-stage meronts, at about 4 days after infection. It is
usually located in the small intestine anterior to the yolk stalk, but may
extend throughout the intestine.
Clinical signs: Disease is seen in turkey poults 2-10 weeks of age and
rarely in older birds because of acquired immunity. The affected poults are
dull, listless, stand with ruffled feathers and have their heads tucked under
birds are huddled together with closed eyes, drooping wings and ruffled
1156
feathers. Their droppings are white and mucoid and, at the peak of the
disease, intestinal cores may be passed and the faeces may contain a few
flecks of blood. Death occurs 5-7 days after infection, particularly in
young poults under 6 weeks old.
 e  t  e  e     
The jejunum is slightly thickened, dilated and contains an excessive
amount of clear, colourless fluid, or mucus containing merozoites, small
amounts of blood and other cells. By days 5-6 after infection, the
duodenum is enlarged and its blood vessels are engorged. It contains a
reddish brown, necrotic core that is firmly adherent to the mucosa and
extends a little way into the upper small intestine. The remainder of the
intestine is congested and petechial haemorrhages may be present in the
mucosa of most of the small intestine. The mucosa begins to regenerate on
the 6th or 7th day after infection. A few petechiae are present in the
duodenum and jejunum. There are small streaks of haemorrhage and
spotty congestion in the ileum. The posterior part of the jejunum and
ileum may contain greenish, mucoid casts, 5-10 cm long and 3-6 mm in
diameter. Necrotic material may be found in the ileum or faeces.
The following two non-pathogenic species of coccidia in turkeys are
uncommon.

Coccidiosis in ducks and geese
Eimeria anseris
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are small and pear-shaped, with a truncated cone,
smooth, colourless, 16-24 × 13-19 μm (mean 21 × 17 μm), with a
the micropyle. Sporocysts are ovoid and almost completely fill the
00cysts, 8-12 × 7-9 μm, with a slightly thickened wall at the small end
and with a residuum. Mature meronts are 12 × 20 μm and contain
approximately 15-25 merozoites. The macrogametes are usually spherical
and 12-26 × 10-15 μm. The microgamonts are 12-66 × 8-18 μm.
Hosts: Domestic goose, blue goose (Anser caerulescens), Richardson's
Canada goose (Branta canadensis hutchinsi)
1158
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically coccidian although precise details of
the life cycle are lacking. There appears to be only one merogony
cells of the villi of the small intestine, and in heavy infections also in the
caeca and rectum. The gamonts are mostly in the subepithelial tissues but
invade the epithelium in heavy infections. The prepatent period is 6-7
days and patent period 2-8 days.
Geographical distribution:Europe
Pathogenesis: There is comparatively little information on coccidiosis of
ducks and geese. E. anseris has been reported as causing acute intestinal
coccidiosis with haemorrhage in goslings.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea with mucus and haemorrhage
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is best based on postmortem examination of a few
affected birds. At necropsy the location and type of lesions present
provide a good guide to the species, which can be confirmed by
examination of the oocysts in the faeces and the meronts and oocysts
present in scrapings of the gut.
Pathology: There may be intestinal hyperaemia, mucus production with
flecks of coagulated blood within the gut lumen. Oocysts are found in
small discrete papilliform lesions.
Epidemiology: E. anseris occurs in young birds and is associated with
birds that are kept under intensive conditions.
Treatment: Little is known about treatment, but by analogy with other
hosts, one of the sulphonamide drugs should be tried.
Control: Prevention is based on good management, avoidance of
overcrowding and stress, and attention to hygiene. Contact with wild
geese should be avoided wherever possible.
Eimeria nocens
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
1159
Family: Eimeridae
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal or ovoid, thick-walled, brown, 25-33
× 17-24 μm (mean 29 × 20 μm), with a distinct micropyle, which is
covered by the outer layer of the oocyst wall. Mature meronts are 15 x 30
usually ellipsoidal or irregularly spherical and 20-25 × 16-2l μm. The
microgamonts are spherical or ellipsoidal and 28-36 × 23-31 μm.
Hosts: Domestic goose, blue goose (Anser caerulescens)
Life cycle: Precise details of the life cycle are lacking. Developmental
stages occur in the epithelial cells of the tips of villi at the posterior part of
the small intestine but may also occur beneath the epithelium. The
younger developmental stages lie near the host cell nuclei, and as they
grow they displace the nuclei and eventually destroy the cell and come to
  d         s
days.
Geographical distribution: Europe, North America
Pathogenesis: E. nocens has been reported as causing acute intestinal
coccidiosis in goslings.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea with mucus and flecks of blood
Diagnosis: As for E. anseris
with small flecks of coagulated blood within the gut lumen.
Epidemiology: E. nocens occurs in young birds and is associated with
birds that are kept intensively under conditions which offer optimal
conditions  of  temperature and   humidity   for  oocyst sporulation.
Overcrowding further exacerbates infection levels and risks from disease.
Treatment and control: As for E. anseris
Tyzzeria perniciosa
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
1160
Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal, colourless, 10-12 × 9-11 μm (mean
12 × 10 μm), without a micropyle and with a residuum. First-generation
meronts are 12 x 8 μm and contain only a few merozoites. Further meront
generations are 15-16 x 14-15 μm and contain more and larger
merozoites.
Hosts: Domestic duck, pintail duck, diving duck (Aythya erythropus)
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically coccidian and there appear to be at
least three merogony generations. The endogenous stages are in the
mucosal and submucosal cells of the small intestine. The prepatent period
is 5 days. Oocyst sporulation time is 1 day.
Geographical distribution: Presumed worldwide
Pathogenesis: T. perniciosa is highly pathogenic for ducklings. Infected

Clinical signs: Anorexia, diarrhoea with mucus and haemorrhage
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is best based on postmortem examination and by
examination of the oocysts in the faeces. Masses of very small rounded
oocysts are present in smears and scrapings of the gut.
Pathology: On postmortem, inflammation and haemorrhagic areas are
intestine. The intestinal wall is thickened and round white spots are visible
through the serosal surface. In severe cases, the lumen is filled with blood
and often cheesy exudates. The intestinal epithelium sloughs off in long
pieces often forming a lifting 'tube'.

Coccidiosis in gamebirds
Pheasants
The development of intensive management systems by pheasant-rearing
farms has led to an increase in coccidiosis. The significance of coccidiosis
in wild pheasants is difficult to assess because natural predators and
scavengers deal promptly with weak or dead birds. Treatment with
clopidol, lasalocid, amprolium
norpotentiated sulphonamides
(sulphaquinolaxaline or sulphadimidine) is generally effective, although
specific efficacy data are lacking-

large refractive globule. First-generation meronts are 18 x 13 μm and
contain 50-100 elongate merozoites; second-generation meronts are 28 x
21 μm and contain large numbers of merozoites and third-generation
meronts measure 8.5 x 7 μm and contain on average 19 merozoites.
Fig. 7.18 Oocyst of Eimeria colchici.
1163
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically coccidian. First-generation meronts
are found deep in the glands of the mucosal lining of the mid small
intestine; second-generation meronts appear in colonies in the lamina
propria at the base of the villi; small third-generation meronts develop in
the glands of the caeca. The gametocytes develop in the epithelial cells
lining the caecal mucosa. The prepatent period is 6 days. Sporulation time
is2days.
Geographical distribution: USA, Europe (UK, Bulgaria, Czech
Republic, Slovakia)
Pathogenesis: E. cofchici is the most pathogenic species of coccidia in
pheasants, producing weight loss and mortality in infected birds.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea and white soiling around the vent
Diagnosis: Postmortem examination of affected birds reveals the
characteristic white cores and examination of scrapings or histological
caeca. On faecal examination there are large numbers of oocysts in a
white caseous exudate (Fig. 7.19).
1164
Pathology: There is hyperaemia and mucoid enteritis in the small
intestine caused by the second-generation meronts. Dead birds have soft
white cores in the caeca and lower small intestine. In the caeca there is
        
epithelium and subepithelial cells of the lamina propria infected. The
cores are composed of oocysts, necrotic debris and food material.

colourless to pale yellowish brown, 18-24 × 15.4-21.4 μm (mean 21.2 ×
18.6 μm), with no micropyle and no 0ocyst residuum (Fig. 7.20). The
ellipsoidal sporocysts measure 11.6-13.6 × 6.1-6.8 μm (mean 12.6 × 6.7
sporocyst residuum largely obscures the sporozoites, which possess a
large refractile body and occasionally a second smaller one.
Fig. 7.20 Oocyst of Eimeria duodenalis.
1165
Life cycle: First-generation meronts appear in the epithelial cells towards
the tips of the duodenal villi. Second- and third-generation meronts follow
on quickly in the same site but extending further along the intestinal tract.
Gametocytes and third-generation meronts are both present together, and
the infection may extend throughout the entire small intestine with the
villi heavily parasitised, and multiple infection of individual epithelial
s   si d d  a o si
time is 1-2 days.
Geographical distribution: Europe (UK, France, Lithuania, Kazakhstan),
USA
Pathogenesis: As the specific name implies, this parasite develops in the
duodenum and upper small intestine where it can cause a mucoid enteritis.
Clinical signs: Light infections are generally asymptomatic but heavier
infections may cause a mucoid enteritis.
Diagnosis: Postmortem examination of affected birds reveals a mucoid
enteritis in the duodenum and upper small intestine and examination of
scrapings or histological sections of affected tissues shows large numbers
of small subspherical oocysts in the small intestine.
Pathology: The intestines of the birds that die are congested and contain a
pinkish mucoid exudate, whilst the caeca may be distended with a foamy
1166
yellow fluid. Scrapings from the small intestine show masses of small
subspherical ooc ysts.
Epidemiology: Coccidiosis in pheasants occurs most frequently in young
birds reared under intensive conditions. Disease surveys carried out in the
UK showed that E. duodenalis accounted for 10-15% of the coccidiosis
cases where species identification was possible.

numbers and has not been associated with outbreaks of disease.
Clinical signs: Not reported
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on oocyst morphology from faecal samples.
Where possible, postmortem examination of affected birds and
examination of scrapings or histological sections of affected tissues should
be undertaken.
Pathology: Not described.
Epidemiology: The significance of coccidiosis in wild pheasants is
with weak or dead birds.
Eimeria pacifica
Predilection site: Small intestine, caeca
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
1167
Family: Eimeridae
Description: Oocysts are 0void, 17-26 × 14-20 μm with a mammilated
oocyst wall.

also been reported in the caeca.
Geographical distribution: North America, Kazakhstan, Lithuania
Pathogenesis: Infection produces mucoid enteritis with low mortality but
high morbidity
Clinical signs: Mucoid diarrhoea
Diagnosis: Postmortem examination of affected birds reveals a mucoid
enteritis and examination of scrapings or histological sections of affected
tissues shows large numbers of small sub-spherical oocysts in the small
intestine and caeca.
Pathology: Not described
Epidemiology: As for other species of coccidia
Eimeria phasiani
Predilection site: Small and large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal, smooth, yellowish, 20.1-30.9 x
13.4-20.5 μm (mean 25 × 17 μm), with no micropyle and no 00cyst
pyriform, each with a prominent Stieda body, 12.9-15.9 × 5.6-7.4 μm
(mean 14.3 x 6.7 μm). Sporozoites contain a single refractile body.
Life cycle: Development of the endogenous stages occurs in the small
intestine and there is a gradual spread down the gut as the infection
proceeds. First-generation meronts develop in the epithelial cells lining the
glands of the ascending duodenum and the upper small intestine.
Second-generation meronts are most numerous towards the tips of the villi
1168
in the upper small intestine. Third-generation meronts and gametocytes
o  xd a i o   s a   
the caeca, being most numerous towards the tips of the villi.
The prepatent period is 5 days. Sporulation time is 2 days.
Geographical distribution: Europe (UK, France, Germany, Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan), USA
Clinical signs: Infection can result in anorexia, depression and a reduction
in weight gain and in heavy infections causes liquid faeces with mucus
and a little blood.
Diagnosis: Postmortem examination of affected birds reveals a mucoid
enteritis and examination of scrapings or histological sections of affected
tissues shows large numbers of gametocytes in the small intestine and
proximal part of the caeca.
Pathology: The main lesions consist of mucoid enteritis in the small
intestine. The intestines of heavily infected birds are hyperaemic and show
blood-streaked mucus (Fig. 7.21). The developmental stages of E.
phasiani occur below the nucleus of the host cell, causing ^ballooning’ of
the infected cell with enlargement of the nucleus. Oocysts occur
throughout the small intestine and in the proximal part of the caeca.
Epidemiology: Coccidiosis in pheasants occurs most frequently in young
birds reared under intensive conditions.
Fig. 7.21 Caecal lesions of Eimeria phasiani.
1169
Disease surveys carried out in the UK showed that E. phasiani accounted
for approximately 15% of the coccidiosis cases where species
identification was possible. In studies conducted in the Czech Republic/
Slovakia, E. phasiani occurred less frequently than E. coichici in wild
pheasants but was most prevalent during the winter and spring when it
was identified in18-41% of the samples examined.

21 × 15 μm), with a micropyle and polar granules but without a residuum.
Sporocysts are ovoid, with a Stieda body and a residuum.
Hosts: Guinea fowl
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically coccidian and there appear to be
three merogony generations. First-generation meronts are in the epithelial
cells of the crypts below the host cell nucleus near the muscularis mucosae
of the duodenum. Second-generation meronts are in the crypts of the
lower part of the villi of the upper and middle small intestine.
Third-generation meronts are in the middle to tips of the villi of the

1175
Cryptosporidium meleagridis
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Cryptosporidiidae
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoid, 5.6-6.3 × 4.5-4.8 μm (mean 6.2 × 4.6
μm).
Hosts: Turkey, chicken, duck, parrot
Life cycle: Oocysts, each with four sporozoites, are liberated in the faeces.
Following ingestion, the sporozoites invade the microvillous brush border
of the proventriculus, intestines and lungs and the trophozoites rapidly
differentiate to form meronts with four to eight merozoites. Only a single
merogony generation has been reported.
Geographical distribution: Presumed worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infection with this parasite has been associated with
diarrhoea and a low death rate in 1o- to 14-day-old turkey poults. C.
meleagridis also infects other avian hosts (for example, parrots) and is
also the third most common Cryptosporidium parasite in humans.
Clinical signs: Diarrhoea
Diagnosis: Oocysts may be demonstrated using Ziehl-Nielsen-stained
faecal smears in which the sporozoites appear as bright red granules.
Speciation of Cryptosporidium is difficult, if not impossible, using
conventional  techniques.  A  range  of molecular and  immunological
techniques has been developed,  that include  the  use of

Hosts: Turkey, game birds (pheasant, quail, partridge)
Life cycle: Trophozoites are formed by binary fission. Cyst stages are
thought to occur.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Spironucelosis is a disease of young birds with adult birds
symptomless carriers. The mortality in a flock varies and can be as high as
80%, reaching a peak in the flock at 7-10 days after the first bird dies, but
heavy losses seldom occur in birds over 10 weeks old. The incubation
period is 4-7 days.

Clinical signs: Affected birds are ruffled, have a foamy, watery diarrhoea.
lose weight rapidly and may become weak and die.
Diagnosis: Infection can be diagnosed by finding the characteristic motile
protozoa in fresh scrapings from the small intestine. The organism can be
differentiated from other flagellates in the gut by its small size, absence of
an undulating membrane and characteristic motion. The organism can also
be demonstrated in Giemsa-stained smears from the small intestine.
water. Carrier adult birds are the most important sources of infection for
young poults. Wild gamebirds may be a source of infection to birds reared
outdoors in natural pens. Hot weather and overcrowding predispose to
infection and the severity of a disease outbreak.
Treatment: Dimetridazole at 27 g/100 litres of drinking water for 12 days
or 54 g/100 litres for 3-5 days then 27 g/100 litres for 12 days are
effective treatments. However, in many countries products containing
dimetridazole are becoming unavailable for legislative reasons.
Control: Control depends on good management and hygiene. Young birds
should be raised in batches away from others birds of different age groups.
Separate utensils should be used for different groups of birds and kept
1178
raised or on wire mesh floors. Outdoor natural pens should be moved
periodically and contact with pheasants, quail or partridge prevented.
Dimetridazole at 125-200 g/tonne in feed or 12 g/l in drinking water for
up to 15 days can be used in prevention. However, see the note above
regarding availability.
LARGEINTESTINE
Several species of Heterakis are found in poultry. Gross examination
examination is necessary to demonstrate the spicules.
Heterakis gallinarum
Synonym: Heterakis papillosa, Heterakis gallinae, Heterakis vesicularis
Common name: Poultry caecal worm
Predilection site: Caeca; rarely large and small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Description, gross: Whitish worms up to 1.5 cm long, with elongated
pointed tails. The male is 7-13 mm long and the female is 10-15 mm.
Gross examination readily indicates the genus, but for specific
shape of the oesophagus and the size and shape of spicules.
Fig. 7.23 Posterior of a male Heterakis gallinarum showing the
 pre-cloacal sucker and caudal alae supported by caudal papillae.
1179
Description, microscopic: The oesophagus has a large posterior bulb.
Generic identity may be confirmed by the presence of a large circular
 pre-cloacal sucker in the male and prominent caudal alae supported by 12
pairs of caudal papillae (Fig. 7.23). The spicules are unequal in length, the
left (about 0.7 mm) has broad alae and the right is slender (about 2 mm),
The egg is 0void, 65-80 × 35-46 μm, thick and smooth-shelled, and is
difficult to distinguish from that of Ascaridia.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey, pigeon, pheasant, partridge, grouse, quail, guinea
fowl, duck, goose and a number of wild galliform birds
Life cycle: The direct life cycle is similar to that of Ascaridia spp. The
egg is infective on the ground in about 2 weeks at optimal temperatures.
Eggs may remain viable in the soil for several months. Earthworms may
be transport hosts, the eggs simply passing through the gut, or paratenic
hosts in which the egg hatches and the L3 travels to the tissues to await
ingestion by the fowl. In H. gallinarum all parasitic moults appear to
1180
occur in the caecal lumen. The prepatent period of the genus is about 4
weeks. Longevity is about 12 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: H. gallinarum is the commonest nematode parasite of
poultry, and is usually regarded as being non-pathogenic, although heavy
infections can induce thickening of the caecal mucosa. Its chief
pathogenic importance is as a vector of the protozoan, Histomonas
meleagridis, the causal agent of *blackhead’ (entero-hepatitis) in turkeys.
The organism can be transmitted from fowl to fowl in the egg of Heterakis
and in earthworms containing hatched larvae of the worm.
Clinical signs: Frequently, H. gallinarum alone produces an
asymptomatic infection.
Diagnosis: H. gallinarum infection is usually only diagnosed accidentally,
by the finding of eggs in faeces or the presence of worms at necropsy.
Differentiation between the three species of Heterakis is based on the
shape of the oesophagus and the length and shape of the spicules.
Pathology: The caeca may show marked inflammation and thickening of
the mucosa with petechial haemorrhages.
Epidemiology: H. gallinarum is widespread in most poultry flocks and is
of little pathogenic significance in itself, but is of great importance in the
epidemiology of Histomonas. Larvated eggs can remain viable in soil for
about l year and can be a source of infection in free-range birds.
Additionally, paratenic hosts such as earthworms can transmit infection.
Treatment:  Treatment with piperazine salts, levamisole or a
benzimidazole, such as flubendazole, mebendazole or fenbendazole, can
be administered in the feed (30 ppm 0ver 7 days; 60 ppm over 7 days; 60
ppm over 3 days; respectively). Levamisole is effective at 30 mg/kg orally
or 300 ppm in the feed.
Control: Control of H. gallinarum is only necessary when histomonosis is

Heterakis isolonche
Common name: Caecal worm
Predilection site: Caeca; rarely large and small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Description, gross: Whitish worms up to 1.5 cm long, with elongated
pointed tails. The male is 7-13 mm long and the female is 10-15 mm.
identification microscopic examination is necessary to demonstrate the
spicules.
Description, microscopic: The spicules are asymetrical and generic
identity may be confirmed by the presence of a large circular pre-cloacal
sucker in the male and prominent caudal alae supported by large caudal
papillae. The egg is 0void, thick and smooth-shelled, about 65-75 × 38-45
μm and is difficult to distinguish from that of Ascaridia.
Hosts: Pheasant, grouse, quail, duck, chicken
Life cycle: As for H. galflinarum. In H. isolonche infection, the hatched
larvae enter the caecal mucosa, and develop to maturity in nodules. Each
nodule has an opening into the gut through which the eggs reach the
lumen.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: H. isolonche of game birds is in itself pathogenic, causing
and diarrhoea with progressive emaciation and there may be high
mortality in heavily infected flocks.
Clinical signs: Infections with H. isolonche may produce nodular
typhlitis, diarrhoea, emaciation and death.
1182
Diagnosis: H. isolonche infection is diagnosed at necropsy by the finding
of caecal nodules containing adult worms, and if necessary, confirmed
microscopically by examination of the spicules.
Pathology: The caeca may show marked inflammation and thickening of
the mucosa with nodule formation and petechial haemorrhages.
Epidemiology: Infection is common in birds raised in permanent grass
Additionally, paratenic hosts such as earthworms can transmit infection.
Treatment: As for H. gallinarum
Control: Where H. isolonche infection is endemic in pheasantries, the
runs should be abandoned and pheasant chicks reared on fresh ground.

Heterakis brevispeculum
Predilection site: Caeca; rarely large and small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Description: See H. galfinarum for general information. The spicules are
of equal length (about 0.5 mm) and possess a barb near the tip.
Hosts: Duck, goose, guinea fowl, chicken
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Trichostrongylus tenuis
Predilection site: Small intestine, caeca
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are small and hair-like. Males measure
around 5.0-6.5 mm and females 7-9 mm in length. The spicules are
curved.
Description, microscopic: The worms have no buccal capsule. A useful
generic character is the distinct excretory notch in the oesophageal region.
Hosts: Game birds (grouse, partridge and pheasant), chicken, duck, goose,
turkey, emu
Life cycle: This is direct and the pre-parasitic phase is typically
trichostrongyloid. Infection is through ingestion of infective L3 from the
environment. The parasitic phase is non-migratory and the prepatent
period is short, only 7-10 days.
Geographical distribution: North America, Asia and Europe
Pathogenesis: T. tenuis has been implicated in outbreaks of severe
enteritis in game birds. Moderate to severe infections cause diarrhoea.
which is often fatal. Lighter infections result in a chronic syndrome
characterised by anaemia and emaciation.
1184
Clinical signs: These are reduced appetite, anaemia and general
emaciation.
Diagnosis: Identification of the adult worms on postmortem
infections can induce an acute haemorrhagic typhlitis

numbers of infective larvae with associated high morbidity and mortality,
particularly in grouse.
Treatment: On game farms, therapy with levamisole in the drinking
water has proved useful. Formulations of fenbendazole and flubendazole
are available for incorporation into feed.
Control: Where game are farmed, the pens should be moved regularly to
 prevent the accumulation of larvae and, if possible, the runs should not be
placed in the same areas in successive years.
Capillaria anatis
Synonym: Capillaria brevicollis, C. collaris, C. anseris, C. mergi
Predilection site: Caeca
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichuroidea
Description, gross: See C. annulata. Males measure around 16-24 mm
and females 28-38 mm.
Description, microscopic: The males have a long thin single spicule and
often possess a primitive bursa-like structure. The eggs are barrel-shaped,
colourless and have thick shells that are slightly striated with bipolar
plugs.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey, gallinaceous birds (pheasant, partridge), pigeon,
duck, goose
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. The infective L1 develops within the
egg in about 3-4 weeks. Infection of the final host is through ingestion of
1185
this embryonated infective stage, development to adult worms occurs
without a migration phase. The prepatent period is 3-4 weeks.

Pathogenesis: The anterior ends of the worms are embedded in the
mucosa. Heavy infection can induce haemorrhagic enteritis with bloody
diarrhoea. The caecal wall is often thickened.
Clinical signs: Infected birds may become weak and emaciated and be
anaemic.
Pathology: Chronically infected birds have thickened intestinal walls
covered with a catarrhal exudate.
Treatment and control is as for other Capillaria species
The following two species of Subulura found in the large intestine are
considered to be of minor significance. Intermediate hosts are cockroaches
and beetles. Treatment and control is not usually required. Note that
1186
current taxonomic revision suggests this genus falls within its own
superfamily: the Subuluroidea.
Subulura suctoria
Synonym: Allodapa suctoria, Subulura brumpti
Predilection site: Caeca
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Oxyuroidea
Description, gross: The males measure around 8-10 mm and the females
up to 18 mm.
Description, microscopic: The small buccal capsule has three teeth at its
base. The oesophagus is dilated posteriorly, followed by a bulb. The tail of
the male has large lateral alae and is curved ventrad. A slit-like pre-cloacal
sucker is present, surrounded by radiating muscle fibres. In the female, the
vulva is situated just anterior to the middle of the body. Eggs are
thin-shelled and spherical, 52-64 × 41-49 mm, and embryonated when
laid.
Final hosts: Chicken, turkey, guinea fowl, quail, grouse, pheasant and
various galliform birds such as ducks
Intermediate hosts: Include various cockroaches, beetles and earwigs
Life cycle: Eggs passed in faeces are ingested by the intermediate host

Strongyloides avium
Common name: Threadworm
Predilection site: Caeca, small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Rhabditoidea
Description, gross: Slender, hair-like worms 2.2 mm long. Only females
are parasitic.
Description, microscopic: The long oesophagus may occupy up to one
third of the body length and the uterus is intertwined with the intestine,
giving the appearance of twisted thread. Unlike other intestinal parasites
of similar size the tail has a blunt point. Strongyloides eggs are oval,
thin-shelled and small, 52-56 × 3640 μm, being half the size of typical
strongyle eggs. The larvated egg is usually passed in the faeces.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey, goose, quail, wild birds
Life cycle: Strongyioides is unique among the nematodes of veterinary
importance, being capable of both parasitic and free-living reproductive
caeca and these produce larvated eggs by parthenogenesis. After hatching,
larvae may develop through four larval stages into free-living adult male
and female worms and this can be followed by a succession of free-living
generations. Infection is generally direct, but percutaneous infection can
occur. The prepatent period is from 8-14 days.

Chicken caecal coccidiosis
Two species of coccidia are found in the chicken, of which Eimeria
tenella is the most important throughout the world.
Eimeria tenella
Predilection site: Caeca (Fig. 7.24)
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
1191
Description: Oocysts are 0void, smooth, colourless 14-31 × 9-25 μm
(mean 25 × 19 μm), without a micropyle or residuum but with a polar
granule. The sporocysts are ovoid, with a Stieda body and without a
residuum.
Host: Chicken
Life cycle: Following ingestion, the oocyst wall breaks in the gizzard
releasing the sporocysts. The sporozoites are activated by bile or trypsin
when the sporocysts reach the small intestine, and they escape from the
sporocysts. The sporozoites enter the epithelial cells either directly or
following ingestion by a macrophage. Each schizont rounds up to form a
first-generation  meront each  containing  about 900  merozoites,
approximately 2-4 μm long. These emerge into the caeca about 2.5-3
days after infection and invade new host cells. Second-generation meronts
are formed, and these lie above the host cell nucleus producing 200-350
merozoites, which are approximately 16 μm long, and which are found 5
days after inoculation. They invade new host cells to either form the
third-generation meronts (which lie beneath the host cell nucleus and
produce 430 third-generation merozoites which are about 7 μm long and
which invade new cells to form gamonts) or to form the gamonts directly.
The macrogametes and microgamonts lie below the host cell nuclei. The
microgamonts form many biflagellate microgametes, which fertilise the
macrogametes. The resulting oocysts lay down a resistant wall, break out
of the cells into the gut lumen and are then passed in the faeces. The
 prepatent period is 132 hours. Sporulation time is 18-48 hours.

1192
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
glands. The second-stage meronts are also unusual in that the epithelial
cells in which they develop leave the mucosa and migrate into the lamina
 propria and submucosa. When these meronts mature and rupture, about 72
hours after ingestion of oocysts, haemorrhage occurs, the mucosal surface
is largely detached and clinical signs become apparent.
Clinical signs: Clinical disease occurs when large numbers of oocysts are
ingested over a short period and is characterised by the presence of soft
1193
faeces often containing blood. The chicks are dull and listless, with
drooping feathers. In subclinical infections, there are poor weight gains
and food conversion rates.
Pathology: At postmortem, the caeca are often found to be dilated and
contain a mixture of clotted, and unclotted blood (Fig. 7.25). In
longer-standing infections, the caecal contents become caseous and
adherent to the mucosa. As regeneration of the mucosa occurs these caecal
plugs are detached and caseous material is shed in the faeces.
Fig. 7.25 Lesions of Eimeria tenella in caeca.
Lesions are scored +1 to + 4 as follows:
1. Very few small scattered petechiae on the caecal wall with no
thickening of the caecal walls and normal caecal contents.
2. Lesions more numerous with noticeable blood in the caecal
contents. The caecal wall is somewhat thickened with normal caecal
contents.
3. Large amounts of blood and caecal cores present. The caecal
walls are greatly thickened with little, if any, faecal contents in the
caeca.
4. Caecal walls are greatly distended with blood or large caseous
cores.

3-7 weeks of age. The prevalence of disease due to this species, and
caecal coccidiosis, has declined since many of the anticoccidial drugs in

Cryptosporidium baileyi
Predilection site: Small and large intestine, cloaca, bursa of Fabricius,
nasopharyx, sinuses, trachea, conjunctiva
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Cryptosporidiidae
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoid, 5.6-6.3 × 4.5-4.8 μm (mean 6.2 × 4.6
μm).
Hosts: Chicken, turkey, duck, cockatiel, quail, ostrich
Life cycle: Oocysts, each with four sporozoites, are liberated in the faeces.
Following ingestion, the sporozoites invade the microvillous brush border
of the proventriculus, intestines and lungs and the trophozoites rapidly
differentiate to form meronts with four to eight merozoites. There appear
to be three merogony generations and both thin- and thick-walled oocysts
have been observed. The prepatent period is 3 days and patent period
10-20 days.
Geographical distribution: Presumed worldwide
Pathogenesis: Cryptosporidium baileyi cryptosporidiosis is a disease of
the epithelial lining of the bursa of Fabricius and cloaca of chicken,
although the trachea and conjunctiva are lesser sites of infection. The
presence of developmental stages in the microvillus region of enterocytes
of the ileum and large intestines are not usually associated with clinical
signs. Similarly, heavy infection of the bursa of Fabricius and cloaca does
not appear to result in clinical illness (Figs 7.26, 7.27, 7.28). In the
respiratory form of infection, up to 50% of a broiler flock may show
clinical signs, and mortalities may reach 10%. Conjunctivitis in several
species of birds has been reported.

Clinical signs: Enteric infections are not associated with clinical signs. In
the respiratory form, initially disease is accompanied by sneezing and
coughing, followed by head extension to facilitate breathing. Severe signs
of respiratory disease last up to 4 weeks post-infection.

small whitish male (up to 0.5 cm) worms, are permanently in copula
o  n u p ssd uo a   us  e 
domestic birds (Fig. 7.31). Males possess two spicules.
Fig. 7.31 Adult Syngamus trachea in situ (arrow).
Description, microscopic: The worms have large shallow cup-shaped
         d    
1206
leaf-crowns. The ellipsoidal thin-shelled eggs are 70-100 x 43-46 μm
with a thick operculum at both ends.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey, game birds (pheasant, partridge, guinea fowl),
pigeon and various wild birds
Life cycle: Eggs escape under the bursa of the male and are carried up the
then swallowed and passed in the faeces. Unlike other strongyloids the L3
develops within the egg. Infection may occur by one of three ways, firstly
by ingestion of the L3 in the egg, secondly by ingestion of the hatched L3
or thirdly by ingestion of a transport (paratenic) host containing the L3.
The most common paratenic host is the common earthworm, but a variety
of other invertebrates including slugs, snails, beetles and some flies may
act as transport hosts. After penetrating the intestine of the final host the
L3 travel, via the liver, to the lungs, probably in the blood since they are
found in the alveoli 4-6 hours after experimental infection. The two
parasitic moults take place in the lungs within 5 days by which time the
parasites are 1.0-2.0 mm long. Copulation occurs around day 7 in the
trachea or bronchi after which the female grows rapidly. The prepatent
period is 16-20 days. Longevity is around 9 months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The effects of S. trachea are most severe in young birds.
especially game chicks and turkey poults. In these, migration through the
lungs in heavy infections may cause emphysema, oedema and result in
pneumonia and death. In less severe infections the adult worms cause a
partial occlusion of the airways and difficulty in breathing. In turkeys, the
male worms can be substantially embedded in the mucosa of the trachea.

poults. Pneumonia during the prepatent phase may cause signs of
dyspnoea and depression, whereas the presence of adult worms and excess
suffocation with the bird gasping for air; often there is a great deal of head
shaking and coughing as it tries to rid itself of the obstruction. The clinical
picture of ^ gapes? may thus range from gasping, dyspnoea and death to, in
less severely affected animals, weakness, anaemia and emaciation.
1207
Diagnosis: This is based on clinical signs and the finding of eggs in the
faeces. Disease is probably best confirmed by postmortem examination of
selected cases when reddish worms will be found attached to the tracheal
mucosa. The infected trachea often contains an increased amount of
mucus.
Pathology: The carcases of infected birds are emaciated and anaemic and
worms are found in the posterior part of the trachea, attached to the
mucosa and surrounded by mucus, which may be streaked with blood. In
turkeys, male worms become deeply embedded in the wall of the trachea,
causing the development of nodules.
Epidemiology: Gapeworm infection primarily affects young domestic
chickens of less than 2-3 months of age, but turkeys of all ages are
Susceptible, the adults often acting as carriers. All ages of other
passeriform and
1   galliform   species   are  susceptible  to  infection.
Infrequently S. trachea can infect anseriform birds. Eggs may survive for
up to 9 months in soil and L3 for years within the earthworm or other
transport hosts. Disease is seen most frequently in breeding and rearing
establishments where outdoor pens, such as are used for breeding
pheasants, are in use. Eggs, passed by wild birds such as rooks and
blackbirds, may initiate infection; these may also infect earthworms.
[nfection is usually highest during the summer when earthworms are
active. Infected chicks normally develop an age resistance by 2-3 months
of age and markedly reduce their worm burdens. Partial immunity to
reinfection is established.
Treatment: In-feed, modern benzimidazoles are effective, administered
usually over a period of several days. Birds need to be monitored, as
severely affected ones may not ingest adequate anthelmintic. Nitroxynil
and levamisole are also very efficacious when given in the water.
Control: Young birds should not be reared with adults, especially turkeys,
and to prevent infection becoming established runs or yards should be
kept dry and contact with wild birds prevented. Avoid the continuous

species are not permanently in copula, which contrasts to the situation
with Syngamus trachea. Eggs are 74-83 × 48-62 μm.
Hosts: Goose, duck, swan
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Young birds are most susceptible to disease and heavy
infections can be pathogenic, leading to emaciation and death.
Clinical signs: In heavy infections these may include depression of food
intake, asphyxia and dyspnoea.
Epidemiology: Severe infections are often associated with the ingestion
of transport hosts such as earthworms, slugs, snails and invertebrates.

Infections often occur seasonally, when, for instance, large numbers of
earthworms occur on the surface after heavy rain.
Typhlocoelum cymbium
Synonym: Tracheophilus sisowi
Predilection site: Trachea, bronchi

Description, gross: Adult fluke are 611.5 mm by 3 mm. The body has
rounded ends and is wide in the middle.
Description, microscopic: Eggs are 122 × 63 μm.
Hosts: Duck
Intermediate hosts: Snails of the genera Hefisoma and Planorbis
Life cycle: Eggs are coughed up and swallowed in the faeces. A
miracidium, containing a single redia, hatches from the egg. The redia, not
the miracidium, enters a snail and after ll days produces small numbers
of cercariae. There is no sporocyst stage. The cercariae are retained within
the snail and encyst. Birds are infected by eating infected snails. The
larval fluke reach the bronchi via the bloodstream.
Geographical distribution: Europe, Asia, Central America
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: The parasites cause obstruction of the
trachea and affected birds may die of asphyxia.

Cytodites nudus
Common name: Air sac mite
Predilection site: Lung, air sac
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Cytoditidae
Description: The air-sac mite, Cytodites nudus, is found in the air
passages and lungs of wild birds, poultry and canaries. The mite is oval
and about 500 μm long, with a smooth cuticle. The chelicerae are absent
and the palps are fused to form a soft, sucking organ through which fluids
1211
are imbibed. Legs are stout and unmodified, ending in a pair of stalked
suckers and a pair of small claws.
Hosts: Birds, particularly poultry and canaries
Life cycle: Larval, nymphal and adult stages take place on the surface of
the respiratory tract of the host, with the complete life cycle of the mite
requiring 14-21 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Small infestations may have no obvious effect on the
animal; large infestations may cause accumulation of mucus in the trachea
and bronchi, leading to coughing and respiratory difficulties, air saculitis
and weight loss. Balance may be affected in infested birds. Weakness,
emaciation and death have been described with heavy infections.
Clinical signs: Coughing, respiratory difficulties, pulmonary oedema,
weight loss, loss of balance or coordination.
Diagnosis: Positive diagnosis is only possible at postmortem, when
necropsy reveals white spots on the surface of air sacs.
Pathology: Death is usually associated with peritonitis, enteritis,
emaciation and respiratory complications.
Epidemiology: Infestation may be spread by the host through coughing
Treatment: Treatment with topical moxidectin every 3 weeks as
necessary may be effective.
Control: It is important to treat all the birds in an aviary when
commencing a preventative programme.
PARASITES OF THELIVER

organ location and the stage of disease. In the caecum, the organism is
round or oval, amoeboid, with clear ectoplasm and granular endoplasm,
6.0-20 μm in diameter, and bears a single flagellum (Fig. 7.32) although
this appears to be lost when in the mucosal tissue or the liver. The nucleus
is vesicular and a flagellum arises from a small blepharoplast near the
nucleus. In the caecal mucosa and liver, the organism is found singly or in
clusters and is amoeboid, 8-15 μm in diameter, with no flagellum. Both
luminal and tissue stages exhibit pseudopodial movement.
Fig.7.32Histomonas meleagridis.
Hosts: Turkey, game birds (pheasant, partridge), occasionally chickens
Life cycle: Birds become infected by ingestion of the embryonated egg of
the caecal worm, Heterakis gallinarum, the flagellate being carried in the
unhatched larva.When the egg hatches, the histomonads are released from
1213
the larva and enter the caecal mucosa where they cause ulceration and
           i
parenchyma, producing circular necrotic foci, which increase in size as the
parasites multiply in the periphery of the lesion. The next phase of the life
cycle is not clear, but it is presumed that the Heterakis worms become
infected with the caecal histomonads, possibly by ingestion, and that these
subsequently reach the ovary of the worm. It is certainly established that
the histomonads become incorporated in a proportion of the Heterakis
eggs, and thus reach the exterior. Infection of birds may also result from
and larvae.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The disease is essentially one of young turkeys up to 14
weeks old and is characterised by necrotic lesions in the caecae and liver.
The earliest lesions are small ulcers in the caeca, but these quickly enlarge
and coalesce so that the entire mucosa becomes necrotic and detaches,
forming, with the caecal contents, a caseous plug. The liver lesions are
circular and up to 1.0 cm in diameter with yellow depressed centres; they
are found both on the surface and in the substance of the liver.
Clinical signs: Infection is often mild and asymptomatic in chickens.
Turkey poults become dull, the feathers are ruffled and the faeces become
sulphur- yellow in colour 8 or more days after infection. Unless treated,
the birds usually die within 1 or 2 weeks.
In older turkeys, the disease is more usually a chronic, wasting syndrome
was first coined to describe the disease when cyanosis of the head and
wattles was thought to be a characteristic feature. However, this sign is not
necessarily present, and anyway is not confined to histomonosis.

occasionally ulcerating and perforating the caecal wall causing peritonitis.
The mucosa becomes thickened and necrotic and may be covered with a
characteristic, foulsmelling yellowish exudate that can eventually form
hard dry caecal cores adhering to the caecal wall. The caeca are markedly
inflamed and often enlarged. Liver lesions are pathognomonic and consist
of circular, depressed, yellowish areas of necrosis and tissue degeneration,
varying in size up to lcm or more and extending deeply into the liver (Fig.
7.33). In older birds the lesions may be confluent and other organs such as

readily found on histopathological examination. Affected lesions are
hyperaemic, haemorrhagic and necrotic with lymphocytic and macrophage
infiltration and the presence of giant cells.
Epidemiology: Although showing no signs of Histomonas infection, the
domestic chicken is commonly infected with H. gallinarum, whose eggs,
if fed to turkeys, will regularly produce histomonosis. Typically,
histomonosis occurs when turkey poults are reared on ground shared, or
recently vacated, by domestic chickens. However, since the organism may
survive in embryonated Heterakis eggs in soil, or as larvae in earthworms,
for over 2 years, outbreaks may arise on apparently clean ground. Young
turkeys may also become infected when reared by broody hens, which are
carriers.

Treatment: A number of drugs are effective, particularly the
nitro-imidazole compounds, such as dimetridazole. These have been
and carcinogenicity, and as such, few, if any, effective treatments are
available.
Turkeys should be reared on ground not used by domestic chickens for at
least 2 years, or on fresh litter or wire floors raised above the ground. In
game bird rearing facilities (pheasant, partridge), young birds should be
raised in raised pens and their droppings removed regularly. When poults
are old enough to be moved to rearing pens they should be placed on clean
           
depending on the climate and soil type. The use of anthelmintics for the
control of Heterakis worms can be an effective control measure in limiting
infection and spread.
PARASITES OF THE
CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Bilharziella polonica
Predilection site: Mesenteric and pelvic veins
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Schistosomatidae
Description, gross: The body is lancet-shaped posteriorly and the sexes
are separate. Males about are 3 mm and females 2 mm.
Description, microscopic: The female genital pore is just behind the
ventral sucker and the short uterus contains one egg at a time. The eggs
have a long, narrow and elongate anterior end and a swollen posterior end
with a terminal spine, and measure 400 × 100 μm.
Hosts: Duck
Intermediate hosts: Snails of the genera Planorbis
1216
Life cycle: Eggs are laid in the small vessels of the intestinal wall through
which they penetrate and are passed out in the faeces. Development takes
place in the snail intermediate host leading to the release of cercariae,
which infect the intermediate host either percutaneously, or following
ingestion.
Geographical distribution: Europe, North America
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Generally
yconsideredtobe
non-pathogenic. Eggs in the wall of the intestine may produce
inflammation. Parasites have been found in the pancreas, spleen and
kidneys, but in these organs they eventually die.
Treatment and control: Not required
Leucocytozoon caulleryi
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Plasmodiidae
Description: Gamonts present in erythrocytes when mature are round,
15.5 × 15 μm, and distort the host cell causing the host cell nucleus to
form a narrow, dark band extending about one third of the way around the
parasite. Meglomeronts present within tissues are 24300 μm in diameter.
Hosts: Chicken, guinea fowl
Life cycle: Sporozoites are introduced into a new host by the feeding
insects. Parasites undergo merogony in the endothelial cells of the liver,
heart, kidney, spleen, thymus, pancreas and other organs of the avian host.
The meronts are spherical or lobed and divide at first into cytomeres,
number of merozoites. Gamonts appear in the blood about 14 days post
the infected host cells become distorted and assume a spindle-shape.
When mature the parasites break out of the host cell and lie free in the
         
Culicoides spp, a zygote is formed which elongates into an ookinete about
21 μm long, which passes through the midgut wall to form sub- spherical
1217
oocysts on the midgut outer wall. Sporozoites are formed and pass to the
salivary glands and are introduced to the new host when the midges bite
them.
Geographical distribution: Asia
Pathogenesis: Some strains of L. caulieryi are non- pathogenic and others
are highly pathogenic, killing a high percentage of chickens in a flock.
Clinical signs: Affected chickens are listless, diarrhoeic and anaemic with
pallid combs and wattles.
Diagnosis: Gamonts can be seen in Giemsa-stained bloodsmears, the
gamont being rounded in L. caulleryi. There are no pigment granules. On
 postmortem there are haemorrhages, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly and
many organs have grossly visible white dots due to the presence of the
meronts.
Pathology: There is marked haemorrhage in the lungs, livers and kidneys
       s    
peritoneal cavity due to the presence of megalomeronts, which cause
haemorrhage on rupture.
Epidemiology: The incidence of disease is linked to the presence and
relative abundance of the midge vectors, Culicoides spp. In Japan,
Treatment: Treatment is not usually effective although pyrimethamine (1
ppm) and sulphadimethoxine (10 ppm) or clopidol at 125 ppm in feed may
 prevent but not cure infections of L. caulleryi.
Control: Control requires eliminating the arthropod vector from the
environment of the host. Insecticidal sprays and repellents sprayed within

averaging 45 x 14 μm, with pale cytoplasmic horns extending out beyond
the enclosed parasite. The host cell nucleus is elongate, forming a long,
thin, dark band along one side of the parasite, often splitting to form a
band on each side of the parasite. Hepatic meronts in the hepatocytes are
10-20 × 7-14 μm (mean 13.5 × 10.5 μm)
Hosts: Turkey
Life cycle: Birds become infected when bitten by a blackfly vector. The
sporozoites enter the bloodstream, invade various tissue cells, round up,
and become meronts. Hepatic meronts occur in the liver cells, the earliest
stage containing round and crescentshaped, basophilic cytomeres, which
develop into masses of deeply staining merozoites that completely fill the
         
microgametes are formed and develop into oocysts to produce sporozoites,
which break out of the oocysts and pass to the salivary glands, where they
accumulate. The prepatent period is 9 days.
Geographical distribution: Europe, North America
Pathogenesis: L. smithi is markedly pathogenic for turkeys, and
affected than poults, and the disease runs a slower course, but even they
may die. Recovered birds continue to carry parasites in their blood. Some
birds recover completely, but in other birds persistent infection may lead
to lethargy, lack of libido in male birds and persistent coughing. Sudden
stress in these birds may lead to death
Clinical signs: Affected poults are anorexic, lethargic and have difficulty

may suddenly collapse, become comatose and die. Birds surviving for 2-3
days after signs of disease appeared, tend to recover.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on finding and identifying the gamonts in
Giemsa-stained blood smears, or the meronts in tissue sections.
Pathology: Affected birds are anaemic and emaciated. The spleen and
liver are enlarged, and there is enteritis involving the duodenum,
sometimes extending throughout the small intestine.
1220
Epidemiology: The vectors of L. smithi are blackflies of the genus
Simulium and disease occurs in domestic and wild turkeys in North
America and Europe in mountainous or hilly areas where suitable blackfly
breeding habitats occur.
Treatment: No effective treatment has been reported.
Control: Prevention depends on blackfly control. Ideally, turkeys should
not be raised in areas where blackflies occur in significant numbers, or
they should be raised under conditions that prevent them from being bitten
by blackflies by rearing in screened quarters using 32-36 mesh screening.
Leucocytozoon simondi
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Plasmodidae
Description: Mature macrogametes and microgamonts are elongate,
sometimes rounded, 14-22 μm long, and present within erythrocytes or
leucocytes, which become elongate, up to 45-55 μm long, with their
nucleus forming a long, thin, dark band along one side. Infected host cells
have pale cytoplasmic horns extending out beyond the parasite and the

Hosts: Duck, goose
Life cycle: Birds become infected when bitten by a blackfly vector. The
sporozoites enter the bloodstream, invade various tissue cells, round up,
and become meronts. Two types of meront occur in the duck. Hepatic
meronts occur in the liver cells, forming a number of cytomeres, which in

Pathogenesis: L. simondi is markedly pathogenic for ducks and geese.
The heaviest losses occur among young birds with very rapid onset. Adult
1222
birds are more chronically affected, and the disease develops more slowly
after the appearance of signs. Death usually occurs as the peripheral
parasitism approaches its peak, 10-12 days after infection. Ducklings that
recover often fail to grow normally, and recovered birds remain carriers.
Clinical signs: Acutely affected ducklings are listless and inappetent, with
rapid, laboured breathing due to obstruction of the lung capillaries with
meronts. They may go through a short period of nervous excitement just
before death. Adult birds are thin and listless.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on finding and identifying the gamonts in
Giemsa-stained blood smears, or the meronts in tissue sections.
Pathology: The principal lesions are splenomegaly with liver hypertrophy
and degeneration. Anaemia and leucocytosis are present, and the blood
clots poorly.
Epidemiology: The vectors of L. simondi are various species of blackflies
(Simulium and other simulids) and disease occurs commonly in domestic
ducks and geese in mountainous or hilly areas where cold, rapid streams

Plasmodiumgallinaceum
Subgenus: Haemamoeba
Synonym:Plasmodiummetataticum
Fig. 7.34 Intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium gallinaceum.
1223
Common name: Avian malaria
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Plasmodidae
Description: The trophozoite is a small rounded form containing a large
vacuole, which displaces the cytoplasm of the parasite to the periphery of
the red blood cell. The nucleus is situated at one of the poles, giving the
young form a ‘signet ring’ appearance when stained by Giemsa. Both
gametocytes and meronts of P. gallinaceum can be round, oval or
irregular in shape. The nucleus of host cells is rarely expelled during
infection, but may be displaced by the parasite (Fig. 7.34). Each meront
16-20 merozoites in erythrocytic meronts.
Hosts: Chicken, guinea fowl
Life cycle: Following the introduction of the sporozoites from infected
mosquitoes, numerous pre-erythrocytic meronts (cryptozoites) are found
in the macrophages and fibroblasts of the skin near the point of entry.
Merozoites from this first generation of pre-erythrocytic meronts form a
second generation of pre-erythrocytic meronts, the metacryptozoites,
which reach maturity at about 72 hours. Merozoites from the metacrypto-

In this species, the exoerythrocytic developmental stages may be added to
by forms which are derived from the erythrocytic cycle. These are known
as phanerozoites, being derived from the merozoites of the meronts in the
erythrocytic cycle.
The erythrocytic cycle is initiated 7-10 days after infection by merozoites
exoerythrocytic meronts located, according to species, in the endothelial
Or haemopoietic cells. On entering the erythrocyte, the merozoite rounds
up to form a trophozoite. The early trophozoites undergo merogony to
produce merozoites, which are released from the meronts synchronously.
After a number of asexual generations have occurred, some merozoites

more intensely blue with Giemsa than do the microgametocytes. Further
development of the gametocyte stages can take place only when a suitable
Following ingestion, the nucleus of the microgametocyte divides, and
through a process of exflagellation, 6-8 μm long, thin, flagella-like
microgametes are extruded from the parent cell, become detached and
swim away to find, and fertilise, the macrogamete. The resulting zygote
(ookinete) is motile and penetrates the midgut mucosa and comes to lie on
the outer surface of the stomach, forming an early oocyst about 50-60 μm
in diameter. The nucleus of the oocyst divides repeatedly to produce a
very large number of sporozoites. Maturation of the oocyst takes a
variable period of time depending on the species of parasite, temperature
and the species of mosquito; but in general, it is 10-20 days. When
mature, the oocyst ruptures, liberating the sporozoites into the body cavity
of the mosquito, which then migrate all over the body of the mosquito but
eventually reach the salivary glands and are now infective to a new host.

it takes a blood meal.
Geographical distribution: Southeast Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Borneo.
India, Sri Lanka. The distribution in domestic chickens coincides with the
natural host, the jungle fowl.
1225
Pathogenesis: Plasmodium gallinaceum can be highly pathogenic in
domestic chickens, particularly when European breeds are introduced into
endemic areas where the cycle is maintained in wild red jungle fowl.
Anaemia is caused by destruction of circulating erythrocytes by
developing meronts. Neurological complications are caused by obstruction
of capillaries in the brain by extra-erythrocytic meronts.
Clinical signs: Birds with acute infection may be lethargic, anaemic with
pale combs, diarrhoeic and show partial or total paralysis.
Diagnosis: Parasites can be seen in Giemsa-stained blood smears. The
presence of meronts with numerous merozoites and round gametocytes
that displace the host cell nucleus are distinctive for P. gallinaceum.
Pathology: There may be pallor of the carcase due to anaemia,
brown-tinged skin and mucous membranes due to pigment deposition,
splenomegaly, and darkening of the viscera, especially liver, spleen, lungs
and brain due to accumulation of pigment. Microscopic lesions are most
evident in the blood. In the kidneys there may be accumulation of pigment
in macrophages, fatty degeneration of the parenchyma and possibly
accumulation of pigment in macrophages in the capillaries, obstruction of
the blood vessels and lymphatics and pulmonary oedema

Plasmodium juxtanucleare
Subgenus: Novyella
Synonym: Plasmodiumjaponicum
Common name: A vian malaria
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Plasmodiidae
Description: Meronts are small, round, ovoid or irregular and usually in
contact with the erythrocyte host cell nucleus and produce two to seven
(mean four) merozoites. Gamonts are round, ovoid, irregular or elongate
pyriform leading to the host erythrocyte often being distorted.
Hosts: Chicken, red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) in Sri Lanka, greywing
(Bambusicola thoracica) in Taiwan
Life cycle: Details on the pre-erythrocytic development following
meronts have been reported in lymphoid-macrophage cells of the spleen,
liver, kidney, heart, lung, bone marrow, testes, pancreas and brain, being
most common in the spleen. Erythrocytic cycles peak at 6-8 days with
merozoites undergoing sexual development with the formation of
microgametocytes and macrogametocytes; the latter are generally more

place only when a suitable mosquito host ingests the blood. Development
in the mosquito is similar to other species.
Geographical distribution: South and Central America (Mexico, Brazil,
Uruguay), Asia (Sri Lanka, Philipines, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia), east
Africa (Tanzania) and South Africa
Pathogenesis: This species is highly pathogenic, causing severe anaemia
through erythrocyte destruction and organ damage due to massive
numbers of exoerythrocytic forms. Central nervous system signs are
1227
associated with exo-erythrocytic forms causing damage to endothelial
cells of the brain capillaries.
Clinical signs: Affected birds are lethargic, depressed, progressively
emaciated and anaemic. Severely affected birds have a protruding
abdomen caused by splenic and hepatic enlargement and ocular
haemorrhage may occur. Affected birds may show paralysis or central
nervous system signs. Coma and death occur in heavy infections after a
short period of time.
Diagnosis: Giemsa-stained blood smears usually reveal numerous
meronts and gamonts in the erythrocytes and infected cells also have dark
pigment granules (digested haemoglobin). As blood samples cool, motile
be distinguished from P. gallinaceum by its more elongate gametocytes
and by tendency of the meront stages to cling closely to the host cell
nucleus.
Pathology: The liver and spleen are enlarged and dark brown-black in
reticuloendothelial cells of the liver, spleen and brain.
Epidemiology: P. juxtanucieare is a parasite of wild birds that infects
domestic chickens when wild reservoir birds and mosquito vectors are
present. Infection is spread by culicine mosquitoes of the genus Culex (C.
sitiens, C. annuius, C. gelidus and C. tritaeniorynchus in Malaysia; C.
saitanensis in Brazil). Natural vectors in other parts of its range are
unknown and detailed epidemiological studies have not been undertaken
Treatment: Affected birds or flocks may be treated with primaquine at
100 mg/kg orally or sulphonamide-trimethoprim combinations may be
tried. Sulphon amide drugs (sulphachloropyrazine, sulphamonomethozine)
and halofuginone, which are effective against other Plasmodium species in
birds, may also be effective.
Control: Since mosquitoes spread malaria, prevention depends on
mosquito control. Residual spraying of poultry houses with insecticides
may be effective. Birds can also be raised in screened quarters in areas
where mosquitoes are particularly prevalent.

Plasmodium durae
Subgenus: Giovannolaia
Synonym: Plasmodium japonicum
Common name: Avian malaria
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Plasmodiidae
Description: Trophozoites are amoeboid in appearance. Mature meronts
rarely displace the host cell nucleus and contain 6-14 (mean eight)
merozoites. Gamonts are elongate, at the end or side of the host cell, and
often displace the host cell nucleus, although the host cell is not usually
enlarged. Pigment granules are usually large, round and black.
Hosts: Turkey, francolins (Francolinus leucoscepus, F. levaillantii
(evaillantii)
Life cycle:

Exo-erythrocytic meronts have been found in capillary endothelial cells of
lung, liver, spleen and brain tissue, but are especially numerous in the
brain. In turkeys, parasitaemias peak between 15 and 25 days post
infection. On entering the erythrocytes, the merozoites round up to form
trophozoites. The early trophozoites undergo merogony to produce
merozoites, which are released from the meronts synchronously. After a
number of asexual generations, some mero- zoites undergo sexual
developmentwith the formationofmicrogametocytes and
Development in the mosquito is similar to other species.

Pathogenesis: Plasmodium durae is highly pathogenic in domestic
turkeys, and depending on strain and geographic location, cause death in
up to 90% of young turkey poults. Adult birds often develop right
capillaries such that infected birds can exhibit neurological signs and
paralysis before death.
Clinical signs: Young poults show few clinical signs until immediately
prior to death, when severe convulsions may occur. Adult birds are
lethargic, anorexic and may develop oedematous legs and gangrene of the

Haemoproteus meleagridis
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Plasmodiidae
1230
Description: Macrogametes and microgametes present in erythrocytes are
elongate and curve around the host cell nucleus, occupying about half to
three quarters of the host cell. The nucleus of macrogametocytes is
generally more compact, the cytoplasm denser, and melanin granules
more evenly distributed compared with  the polar clustering in
microgametocytes.
Hosts: Turkey
Life cycle: Details of the life cycle are incomplete. Sporozoites in the
salivary gland of the insect vector enter the circulation of the host when
the insect bites. Meronts occur in the vascular epithelium of the lung,
liver, kidney and spleen. Merozoites develop within the meront in clusters
and when mature are released into the circulation as tiny round bodies
which  transform  into  macrogametes   and  microgamonts   within

nasal passages.
Clinical signs: Birds may be observed scratching the eyes if they become
irritated. Affected birds develop opthalmitis, which becomes inflamed
with wateryeyes.
Diagnosis: A definitive diagnosis is made by finding the parasite in the
conjunctival sac. It may be necessary to instill local anaesthetic into the
or first-stage larvae
of the eyeball.
Treatment: Oral or topical levamisole or tetramisole and ivermectin have
instillation of local anaesthetic has been reported

Nymphal stage of various dragonflies
Life cycle: Eggs are passed in faeces and hatch to produce a miracidium,
which penetrates a snail to form a mother sporocyst, which produces
daughter sporocysts. These directly produce cercariae, there being no
redial development, and the cercariae are shed from the snail and will

Eimeria truncata
Predilection site: Kidney
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are ovoid, smooth, with a narrow truncate small
end, 14-27 x 12-22 μm with a micropyle and micropylar cap, sometimes
with a residuum. Mature meronts in the renal epithelial cells are 13 μm in
diameter and contain 20-30 merozoites. Macrogametes are 12-18 × 11-15
μm and microgamonts are 15-22 × 13-18 μm.
Hosts: Domestic goose, greylag goose (Anser anser), Canada goose
(Branta canadensis), Ross? goose (Anser rossi)
1240
Life cycle: Complete details on the life cycle are lacking. Meronts and
gamonts occur in the epithelial cells of the kidney tubules. The prepatent
period is 5-14 days. Sporulation time is 1-5 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: E. truncata, found in the kidneys of geese, can cause an
acute nephritis especially where domestic geese are reared intensively. [t
is highly pathogenic for young goslings and can cause up to lo0%
mortality within a few days of onset of clinical symptoms. Outbreaks have
also been recorded in geese in wildfowl sanctuaries.
Clinical signs: Marked weakness, emaciation, polydipsia, muscular
incoordination and death
Diagnosis: Infection is diagnosed by identification of oocysts in urates or
Pathology: The kidneys are markedly enlarged, light in colour, and show
numerous small, white nodules, streaks and lines on the surface and
throughout the cortex and medulla of the kidney. Infected cells are
eventually destroyed and the adjacent cells show pressure atrophy and
destruction. Affected tubules are packed with urates, oocysts and gamonts
in various stages of development and may be enlarged up to 5-l0 times
the diameter of normal tubules.
Epidemiology: E. truncata occurs as a sporadic parasite in domestic
geese and is most likely to occur when geese are kept in crowded,
unsanitary conditions. Contact with wild geese may introduce the
infection.

Control: Prevention is based on good management, avoidance of
overcrowding and stress, and attention to hygiene. Contact with wild
geese should be avoided wherever possible.

PARASTTESOFTHE
LOCOMOTORY SYSTEM
Sarcocystishorvarthi
Synonym: Sarcocystis gallinarum
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystiidae
Description: In the chicken, the tissue cysts are l-10 mm long with
striated walls and are found in skeletal muscles of the breast, thigh, neck
and oesophagus.
Final host: Dog
Intermediate hosts: Chicken
Life cycle: Infection in the chicken is by ingestion of sporocysts in dog
faeces. Complete details of the merogony phase of development are not
known. Ultimately, merozoites penetrate muscle cells where they encyst
giving rise to broad banana-shaped bradyzoites contained within a
sarcocyst, which is the infective stage for the carnivorous final host.
Geographical distribution: Unknown, presumed worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infections in chickens are generally inapparent, but have
been reported to cause severe myositis or muscular dystrophy.
Clinical signs: Muscle weakness and inability to stand have been
reported.
Diagnosis: Antemortem diagnosis is difficult and most cases of
Sarcocystis infection are only revealed at postmortem when grossly
visible sarcocysts in the muscle are discovered or detected by microscopic
examination.
Epidemiology: Little is known of the epidemiology, but it is clear that
where dogs are kept in close association with chickens or their feed, then
transmission is likely.
1242
Treatment and control: Treatment is not indicated. The only control
housed in, or allowed access to, fodder stores nor should they be allowed
to defecate in pens where chickens are housed. It is also important that
dogs are not fed raw or uncooked chicken.
Toxoplasma gondii
Predilection site: Muscle, lung. liver, reproductive system, central
nervous system
Order: Sporozoasida
Family: Sarcocystidae
Description: Tachyzoites are found developing in vacuoles in many cell
types, for example fibroblasts, hepatocytes, reticular cells and myocardial
cells. In any one cell there may be 8-16 organisms, each measuring
6.0-8.0 μm. Tissue cysts, measuring up to 100 μm in diameter, are found
mainly in the muscle, liver, lung and brain may contain several thousand
lancet-shaped bradyzoites.
Final hosts: Cat, other felids
Intermediate hosts: All warm-blooded mammals and birds
Life cycle: The definitive host is the cat in which gametogony takes place
(see Chapter 6). Birds act as an intermediate host in which the cycle is
extra-intestinal and results in the formation of tachyzoites and bradyzoites.
which are the only forms found in non-feline hosts.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Most Toxoplasma infections in animals
are light  and consequently asymptomatic.  Toxoplasmosis has been
occasionally reported in poultry and is usually mild and unnoticed.
Diagnosis: Tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii are often difficult to find in
tissue sections, but are more likely to be present in sections of brain and
placenta. Identification can be confirmed by immunohisto- chemistry,
while the polymerase chain reaction may be used to identify parasite DNA
in tissues.
1243
Epidemiology: The cat plays a central role in the epidemiology of
toxoplasmosis and infection in poultry may occur through ingestion of
feed contaminated with cat faeces or through ingestion of bradyzoites and
tachyzoites in the flesh of another intermediate host, such as rats.
Treatment and control: As for Sarcocystis hovarthi

Life cycle: Larvae are released into water and infective stages have been
shown to occur in Cyclops in Taiwan. Infection of the final host occurs
through the ingestion of the intermediate host.
Geographical distribution: China, Taiwan

Pathogenesis: The worms cause the formation of swellings under the
mandible, which are at first soft and movable and, after about 1 month.
asphyxia. Occasionally the swellings occur on the shoulders and legs and
interfere with the bird's movements. Numerous microfilariae are found in
the blood. The adult worms eventually rupture and disintegrate and
healing occurs, although if the worms die in the swellings, abscesses may
form. The disease lasts about ll months.
Clinical signs: Hard, painful swellings located under the mandible, and
occasionally on the shoulders and legs. Surviving birds have poor growth
rates.
Diagnosis: Identification of the adult worms within subcutaneous
swellings
Pathology: Not described
Epidemiology: Found in domesticated ducks in China, mainly in the dry
season (January to April), and in Taiwan, where disease may also occur in
September to October. It affects ducks 3 weeks to 2 months old.
Treatment: Removal of the worms through an incision into the most
prominent part of the swelling and antiseptic treatment of the swelling is
effective.
Control: Ducklings should be provided with water free from Cyclops and
should not be allowed access to marshland.
Collyriclum faba
Common name: Skin or cystic fluke
Predilection site: Skin, subcutaneous tissues, particularly around the
cloacal opening
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Troglotrematidae
1245
Description, gross: This fluke has a spiny tegument, is dorsally convex
and ventrally flattened and measures about 4 x 5 mm. There is no ventral
sucker.
Description, microscopic: Eggs are very small, measuring about 20 × 10
μm.
Final hosts: Chicken, turkey and wild birds
Intermediate hosts: 1. Snails. 2. Dragonfly nymphs
Life cycle: Eggs are passed through an opening in the wall of the cyst and
hatch in the environment to produce a miracidium, which penetrates a
snail. These directly produce cercariae, there being no redial development,
and the cercariae are shed from the snail and will enter dragonfly larvae,
where they encyst to the metacercaria stage. Infection of the final host
occurs through ingestion of the infected dragonfly. The immature
trematodes then migrate to the subcutaneous tissues.
Geographical distribution: Europe, Asia, North and South America
Pathogenesis: Commonly found in tissue around the cloaca but in heavy
infections flukes may also be present along the thorax, abdomen, beak and
neck. Such infections produce anaemia and loss of body condition and can
be fatal.
Clinical signs: Young birds may show difficulty in moving, inappetance,
anaemia, emaciation and even death. The presence of cysts can lead to
disfigurement of the skin.
Diagnosis: Typical cysts are found around the cloacal opening and along
the thorax and abdomen. Each cyst has a central opening and a pair of
flukes.
Pathology: The flukes are located in hard whitish grey subcutaneous
cysts, which can measure around 3-10 mm in diameter. These cysts have
a central pore and contain a pair of flukes and are usually filled with dark
fluid and eggs.
Epidemiology: Only birds with access to marshy areas where the
intermediate hosts occur are likely to become infected.
Treatment: Surgical removal is the only effective treatment.
1246
Control: Birds should be restricted from entering marshy areas.
ECTOPARASITES
LICE
Heavy louse infestation is known as pediculosis and is particularly
common in poultry. All species on birds are chewing lice and therefore are
of importance because of the direct damage they cause by chewing the
skin or feathers, although some blood-feeding may occur when the base of
feathers are damaged. Clinical importance is therefore usually a function
physical contact.
Description: Lice have a segmented body divided into a head, thorax and
abdomen. They have three pairs of jointed legs and a pair of short
antennae. All lice are dorsoventrally flattened and wingless. The sensory
organs are poorly developed; the eyes are vestigial or absent.
Life cycle: The general life cycle of poultry lice is relatively uniform
across the various species. During a lifespan of approximately a month the
female lays 200-300 operculate eggs ('nits'). These are usually whitish,
            
egg is similar to, although much smaller than, the adult. The nymph
moults three times over 2-3 weeks before giving rise to the adult. The lice
several weeks on the host but can remain alive only for about 1 week off
the host. The bird lice can digest keratin; biting off pieces of feather,
breaking these up with comb-like structures in their crops, and digesting
them with secretions aided by bacterial action. They will ingest not only
the sheaths of growing feathers, but also down and skin scabs.
Clinical signs: Restlessness, feather damage, emaciation and markedly
reduced performance are all symptoms of severe pediculosis. Infected

the species of louse found on poultry, the effects of avian pediculosis are
broadly similar, varying only in degree. Heavy infestations decrease

malathion, cypermethrin or rotenone, can be used to kill lice. However, as
the insecticides are unable to kill the eggs, two applications are necessary
with a 10-14-day interval. Deep-litter or free-range birds may be more

nesting should be thoroughly cleaned to eliminate sources of reinfestation
such as egg-laden feathers. As would be expected, the practice of

de-beaking allows an increase in infestations by preventing birds from
preening and grooming.
Cuclotogaster heterographus
Common name: Head louse
Predilection site: Skin and feathers of the head and neck
Parasite class: Insecta
Order: Phthiraptera
Sub-order: Ischnocera
Family: Philopteridae
Description, gross: A grey, slow-moving louse found close to the skin.
Cuclotogaster heterographus has a rounded body with a large, slender
head, which is rounded at the front (Fig. 7.36). Adult males measure
approximately 2.5 mm and females 2.6 mm in length.
Fig. 7.36 Adult female Cuclotogaster heterographus (dorsal view).
1249
Description, microscopic: The first segment of the antennae of males is
long and thick and bears a posterior process. The abdomen is elongate in
the male and barrel-shaped in the female, with dark brown lateral tergal
plates. Three long bristles project from each side of the dorsal surface of
the head and the five-segmented antennae are fully exposed. Each leg has
two tarsal claws.
Hosts: Chicken, other poultry
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: As the common name, chicken head louse, suggests,
Cuclotogaster heterographus occurs mainly on the skin and feathers of the
head, although it occurs occasionally on the neck and elsewhere. C.
heterographus feeds on tissue debris; skin scales and scabs and can digest
keratin from feathers and down. Infestation with C. heterographus is
particularly important in young birds. Infestations of young birds and

feathered, head lice infestation decreases, but can increase again when the
birds reach maturity.

Parasite class: Insecta
Order: Phthiraptera
Sub-order:Ischnocera
Family: Philopteridae
1251
Description, gross: The fluff louse, Goniocotes gallinae, is one of the
smallest lice found on poultry, at about 0.7-1.3 mm in length. It has a pale
yellow, almost circular body (Fig. 7.37).
  s       
bristles projecting from each side of its dorsal surface. The antennae are
tarsal claws on each leg and few hairs on the dorsal abdomen.
Hosts: Chicken
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Goniocotes gallinae may occur on the down feathers
anywhere on the body, but are often found in the fluff at the bases of
feathers, the preferred sites being the back and the rump. These lice
generally occur in low densities and so have little effect on the host.
However, cases of severe Goniocotes infestation can cause restlessness,
damaged plumage, anaemia and markedly reduced performance.

Hosts: Chicken
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Goniodes dissimilis is more abundant in temperate habitats.
Birds are unable to rest, cease feeding and may injure themselves by
scratching and feather plucking. In general young birds suffer more
severely, with loss of body weight, debility and perhaps death.

ventrally on the head, short antennae (three to five segments) and a
dorsoventrally flattened body. They are large lice, the adults reaching up
to 5 mm in length.
Hosts: Turkey
Life cycle: During a lifespan of about a month the female lays 200-300
operculate eggs ('nits'). These are usually whitish, and are glued to the
hair or feathers, where they may be seen with the naked eye. The eggs
hatch within 4-7 days and the lice spend their entire life cycle on the host,
feeding on feather debris. The nymph that hatches from the egg is similar
to, although much smaller than, the adult. The nymph moults three times
Over 2-3 weeks before giving rise to the reproductive adult.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Birds are unable to rest, cease feeding and may injure
themselves by scratching and feather plucking, with results often more
serious than any immediate damage by the lice. This species of louse is
commonest in adult birds, but young birds that do become infested suffer
more severely, with loss of body weight, debility and perhaps death. The
bird lice can digest keratin, biting off pieces of feather, breaking these up
with comb-like structures in their crops, and digesting them with
secretions aided by bacterial action. They will ingest not only the sheaths
of growing feathers, but also down and skin scabs.
Clinical signs: In general, young birds suffer more severely, with loss of
body weight, debility, and perhaps death. In adult laying birds the effect
on body weight is slight, and the main loss is in depression of egg
production.
1255
Epidemiology: Infection occurs after direct contact with an infested host
animal. Cross-contamination between different host species is possible if
the animals have physical contact.
Lipeurus caponis
Common name: Wing louse
Predilection site: Skin, wing and tail feathers
Parasite class: Insecta
Order: Phthiraptera
Sub-order: Ischnocera
Family: Philopteridae
Description: Grey, slow-moving lice found close to the skin on the
under-side of the large wing feathers. These lice are slender and elongate
in length and 0.3 mm in width (Fig. 7.39). The head is long and rounded at
the front, and the antennae are five-segmented and fully exposed. The legs
are narrow and bear two tarsal claws. Characteristically the hind legs are
about twice as long as the first two pairs of legs. There are characteristic
small angular projections on the head in front of the antennae. There are
relatively few dorsal hairs on the abdomen.
Hosts: Chicken
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: L. caponis is common on the underside of the wing and tail
feathers of chicken and other fowl throughout the world. Pathogenic
effects are usually slight in healthy animals and include restlessness,
irritation and general unthriftiness. Young birds may be susceptible to
heavy infestation, especially where underlying disease or malnutrition is
debilitating.

Description, microscopic: The head is almost triangular in shape and the
ventral portion of the front of the head is armed with a pair of spine-like
processes. The palps and four-segmented antennae are distinct. The
antennae are club-shaped and mostly concealed beneath the head. The
flattened abdomen is elongated and broadly rounded posteriorly with two
dorsal rows of setae on each abdominal segment. There are three pairs of

Hosts: Chicken, turkey, guinea fowl, peafowl, pheasant, quail, cage birds
(canary)
Geographical distribution:Worldwide

1258
Pathogenesis: Menacanthus stramineus is the most pathogenic louse of
adult birds, and may lead to fatalities in chicks. It is an extremely active
         s  s
Infestation can result in severe irritation, causing skin inflammation and
localised scabs and blood clots, especially in the region of the vent, and in
young birds, on the head and throat. Birds become restless and do not
digest their food properly. Ultimately infestation may result in decreased
hen weight, decreased clutch size and death in young birds and chicks.
Populations may reach as many as 35 000 lice per bird. Lice infestations
 often accompany manifestations of poor health such as internal parasitism,
infectious disease, malnutrition and poor sanitation. Although found
naturally infected with the virus of eastern encephalomyelitis, it is not
considered an important vector.
Epidemiology: This species is the most common and destructive louse of
domestic chickens. It is widespread and often reaches pest proportions. It
is most common on the breast, thighs and around the vent. In heavy
infestations, the lice may also be found under the wings and on other parts
of the body, including the head. After introduction into a flock
Menacanthus stramineus spreads from bird to bird by contact.
Cross-contamination between different host species is possible if the
animals have physical contact. Large populations are particularly common

Description: Pale yellow, rapidly moving louse. It is a small louse; adults
measure approximately 2 mm in length. Menopon gallinae has small palps
and a pair of four-segmented antennae, folded into grooves in the head

(Fig. 7.41). The abdomen is tapered posteriorly in the female but rounded
in the male and has a sparse covering of small to medium-length setae on
its dorsal surface.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey, duck

Sub-order: Amblycera
Family: Menoponidae
Description: A small, rapidly moving louse which especially favours the
feather'.
Hosts: Ducks
Life cycle: The nymph moults three times over 2-3 weeks before giving
rise to the reproductive adult. Individuals are highly mobile and move
rapidly.
Geographical distribution: worldwide
Pathogenesis: Partly due to irritation birds preen continuously, but
without the oily secretion the feathers cannot be waterproofed. Unable to

skin, and when much of the body is affected the birds are soaked, and may
die of pneumonia following chilling. Though the damaged plumage may
be replaced at the annual moult it soon degenerates, as a result of the
excessive preening, into its former sodden condition.
Clinical signs: Wet damaged plumage
Diagnosis: Lice and their eggs are visible on the skin and feathers of the
host animal.
Pathology: The pathology of louse infestation is highly variable. In heavy
infestations the skin becomes inflamed, erythematous and eventually
covered by scabs and blood clots.
Epidemiology: Infection occurs after direct contact with an infested host
animal. Cross-contamination between different host species is possible if
the animals have physical contact.
Treatment: Topical insecticidal compounds such as permethrin, carbaryl,
malathion, cypermethrin or rotenone can be used to kill lice. However as
the insecticides are unable to kill the eggs, two applications are necessary
with a l0-day interval.
Control: Although methods such as dusting the nesting material or
providing insecticide-treated laying boxes can be used to avoid undue
handling of birds, the results obtained from treating individual birds are
undoubtedly better.
There is a large number of closely related species of lice that may be
found on ducks, geese and other waterfowl. Of epidemiological
significance is that these species are amongst the least specific of all lice.
The lice can be found on the skin and feathers in all areas of the body. [n
ducks, infection with lice can damage feathers affecting water resistance
and insulation so that the birds may die from cold. Treatment and control

Clinical signs: This mite causes feeding lesions most commonly seen on
the breast or legs of the bird. The feeding nymphs and adults cause
irritation, restlessness and debility, and in heavy infections there may be
severe, and occasionally fatal, anaemia. Newly hatched chicks may die
rapidly as a result of mite activity. Egg production may decrease
significantly.
Diagnosis: The mites may be found in poultry housing during the day,
particularly in cracks or where roost poles touch supports, or on birds at
night. The mites can be observed in these locations with the naked eye,
found in the nasopharyngeal system of dead birds.
Pathology: The effects of mites are highly variable, but may include
hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, epidermitis, dermatitis, poor feather growth
and loss of feathers.

Common name: Poultry red mite, roost mite
Predilection site: Skin
Class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Mesostigmata
Family: Dermanyssidae
Description: The red mite or chicken mite, Derm- anyssus gallinae, is
one of the most common mites of poultry. It is a mesostigmatid mite that
feeds off the blood of fowl, pigeons, caged birds and many other wild
birds. It occasionally bites mammals, including humans, if the usual hosts
are unavailable. The adults are relatively large at 0.75-1 mm in length.

to black when engorged. A single dorsal shield is present, which tapers
posteriorly but is truncated at its posterior margin. The anal shield is
relatively large and is at least as wide as the genitoventral plate. Three
anal setae are present. The chelicerae are elongate and stylet-like.
1264
Hosts: Domestic poultry and wild birds; occasionally parasitic on
mammals, including humans.
Life cycle: This mite spends much of its life cycle away from its host; the
adult and nymph only visiting birds to feed, mainly at night. The favoured
habitats are poultry houses, usually of timber construction, in the crevices
of a week, allowing large populations to develop rapidly, although during
cold weather the cycle is slower. Approximately 1 day after feeding,
batches of eggs are laid in hiding places, detritus or near nests and roosts.

Within another couple of days they moult again, and soon afterwards they
complete their final moult to become an adult. Both nymphal stages feed,
as do the adult mites. The adult can survive for several months without
feeding, so a reservoir population can persist in unoccupied poultry houses
and aviaries.

the breast or legs of the bird. The mites can directly cause irritation and
anaemia, and can lower egg production and weight gain. Newly hatched
chicks may rapidly die as a result of mite activity. Infestation of pigeons is
common. Cats and dogs may become infested as a result of contact with
poultry, and human carriers are also important. In Australia, Dermanyssus
gallinae is a vector of Borrelia anserina, the cause of avian
spirochaetosis.

view. (b) Ventral view (reproduced from Baker et af., 1956).
1265
Epidemiology: Populations generally increase during the winter months
and decrease in the summer months, and infestation intensity increases
during the host breeding period. The presence of nestlings may stimulate
rapid reproduction and an exponential increase in mite numbers, so that at
 the time of fledging there are a significantly higher proportion of nymphs
in the nest than adults. Mites are transmitted by mite dispersion between
farms (through the transport of crates, egg flats or even on humans
themselves), or by direct contact between birds. Dermanyssus gallinae
may be an important pest of poultry flocks maintained on the floor in barn
or deep-litter systems, but is less important in caged production facilities.
Since Dermanyssus can survive for long periods in the absence of a host, a
poultry house may remain infested several months after birds are
removed.
Treatment: Treatment of birds is only palliative, and attention should be
paid to the mite habitats in buildings. Individual birds may be treated by
spraying or dusting the birds with an acaricide such as a pyre- throid or
carbaryl, coumaphos, malathion or stirofos. Systemic control with
repeated treatment with ivermectin (1.8-5.4 mg/kg) or moxidectin (8 mg/
kg) is effective for short periods.
1266
Control: Buildings and equipment should be cleaned, scalded with
boiling water and treated with an acaricide such as carbaryl or synergised
pyrethroids. Dimethoate and fenthion may be used as residual house
sprays when poultry are not present. Where the mites have invaded
dwelling houses their ability to survive in nests, without feeding for
several months, makes these important as reservoir sites, and all nests
Buying-in mite-free birds and using good sanitation practices are
important to prevent a build-up of mite populations.
Notes: Dermanyssus readily infects other animals, and can cause
erythema and intense pruritus in cats that occupy old wooden poultry
houses. Humans may develop skin lesions when mites enter rooms from
wild birds’ nests in the eaves of houses.
Ornithonyssus sylviarum
Synonym: Liponyssus
Common name: Northern fowl mite
Predilection site:Base of the feathers,particularly thevent area
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Mesostigmata
Fig. 7.43 Adult females Ornithonyssus sy/viarum (northern fowl mite). (a)
Dorsal view. (b) Ventral view (reproduced from Baker et al., 1956).
1267
Family: Macronyssidae
Description: The adults are relatively large, 0valshaped, 0.75-1 mm in
length with long legs that allow it to move rapidly (Fig. 7.43). The body is
usually greyish-white, becoming red to black when engorged. A single
become about half as wide, and is truncated at its posterior margin. The
female typically has only two pairs of setae on the sternal shield. The anal
shield is relatively large and at least as wide as the genitoventral plate.
Three anal setae are present. The chelicerae are elongate and stylet-like.
The body carries many long setae and is much more hairy than
Dermanyssus.
Hosts: Poultry and wild birds
Life cycle: Unlike Dermanyssus, Ornithonyssus spends its entire life on
the bird and can only survive for about 10 days away from a host. The
female lays one to five sticky, whitish eggs on the host at the base of the
feathers, primarily in the vent area, after a blood-meal. The eggs hatch
within approximately a day to produce hexapod larvae. The larvae do not
feed, and moult to become protonymphs. The protonymphs feed on blood
1268
from the host, before moulting over to become tritonymphs. The
tritonymphs do not feed, and moult to the adult stage. The entire life cycle
can be completed in 5-12 days under optimal conditions, but usually takes
longer. Due to the short generation times large populations can develop
rapidly on the birds.

Pathogenesis: Ornithoryssus sy/viarum is a bloodsucking ectoparasite. [t
occasionally bites mammals, including humans, if the usual hosts are
encephalitis, Newcastle disease, chlamydiosis and western equine
encephalomyelitis. The viruses that cause western equine encephalitis and
St. Louis encephalitis have both been detected in O. syiviarum from nests
of wild birds in North America, and it is likely that this mite acts a vector

pruritus.
feather shafts. Feathers may become matted and severe scabbing may
develop, particularly around the vent. Infested chickens show a grey-
black discoloration of the feathers due to the large number of mites
present. In heavy infections, birds are restless and lose weight from
irritation, egg production may be reduced, and there may be severe
anaemia. Common signs, apart from debility, are thickened, crusty skin
and soiled feathers around the vent.
Diagnosis: The mites are found on the birds or in their nesting and

Pathology: Feeding causes pruritus, feather damage, weakness, anaemia
and death. Scratching of the bites may result in secondary bacterial
infection.
Epidemiology: As Ornithonyssus syiviarum is almost a permanent
parasite, infection occurs via contact or by placing birds in
accommodation recently vacated by infected stock.

Ornithonyssus bursa
Synonym: Liponyssus bursa
Common name: Tropical fowl mite
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Mesostigmata
Family: Macronyssidae
Description: Similar to O. syiviarum. However, the ventral plate bears
three pairs of setae, while in O. syivarium and D. gallinae only two pairs
of setae are on the ventral plate.
Hosts: Poultry and wild birds
Geographical distribution: Tropical: Southern Africa, India, China,
Australia, Columbia, Panama and US A
Epidemiology: In warmer climates O. bursa is thought to replace the
northern fowl mite, O. syiviarum.

Common name: Depluming itch mite
Predilection site: Feathered areas
Parasite class: Arachnida
1270
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Fig.7.44
Adult female of Knemidokoptes gallinae, dorsal view
(reproduced from Hirst, 1922)
Family: Knemidokoptidae
Description: This is the only burrowing genus of mites on domestic birds,
and resembles Sarcoptes in many respects. The circular body and short,
stubby legs and the avian host are usually sufficient for generic diagnosis
(Fig. 7.44). Although similar in appearance to Knemidokoptes mutans,
individuals are typically smaller, and the pattern of dorsal striations is
unbroken.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey, pheasants and geese
1271
Life cycle: The fertilised female creates a winding burrow or tunnel in the
upper layers of the epidermis, feeding on liquid oozing from the damaged
tissues. Females are ovo-viviparous, giving birth to live hexapod larvae,
which crawl onto the skin surface. These larvae, in turn, burrow into the
superficial layers of the skin to create small 'moulting pockets', in which
the moults to protonymph, tritonymph and adult are completed. The adult
male then emerges and seeks a female either on the skin surface or in a
or extend the moulting pocket. The entire life cycle is spent on the host
and is completed in 17-21 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The parts of the body most commonly infected are the
head, neck, back, abdomen and upper legs. Severe cases can result in
emaciation and death.
Clinical signs: Knemidokoptes galfinae burrows into the feather shafts.
This is known as *depluming itch'. The condition is characterised by
intense scratching and feather loss over extended areas of the body.
Feathers fall out, break off or are pulled out by the bird. Mites may be
found embedded in the tissue at the base of feather quills, causing scaling,
papules and thickening of the skin.
        
 presence of the parasite. Identification of the mite species can be achieved
taken from the edge of lesions.
Pathology: The burrowing activity of the mites causes hyperkeratosis,
thickening and wrinkling of the skin, and sloughing of the keratinous
layers. Proliferative skin lesions may be observed on the legs, with digit
necrosis observed in some birds.
Epidemiology: Infestation is especially prevalent in spring and summer
and may disappear in autumn. New hosts are infected by contact. Infection
may remain latent for a long time with a small static mite population until
stress, such as chill or movement to a strange cage, occurs and the
population increases.
1272
Treatment: Malathion and sevin dusts may be applied. Birds may also be
treated with ivermectin; two to three treatments at 10-day intervals may be
required to completely eliminate the mites. The ivermectin may be applied
on the skin behind the neck, orally or injected. For individual birds
repeated topical application of paraffin may also be effective, if time
consuming-
Control: Repeated treatments of acaricides will prevent reinfestations. All
housing should be thoroughly disinfected.
Knemidokoptes mutans
Synonym: Cnemidocoptes
Common name: Scaly leg mite
Predilection site: Beneath the scales of the feet and legs
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Knemidokoptidae
Description and life cycle: Details are as for K. gallinae
Hosts: Chicken, turkey
Fig. 7.45 Damage to the scales of the legs and feet caused by burrowing of
the miteKnemidokoptes mutans.
1273
Pathogenesis: In poultry, Knemidokoptes mutans affects the skin beneath
the leg scales, causing the scales to loosen and rise, and giving a ragged
appearance to the usually smooth limbs and toes (Fig. 7.45). Lameness
and distortion of the feet and claws may be evident. The mites get onto the
feet of the birds from the ground, and the lesions develop from the toes
upwards.
Clinical signs: Raised scales on the feet and legs. The infestation may
result in lameness and malformation of the feet. Occasionally the neck and
comb may be affected. As the disease progresses over the course of
several months, birds stop feeding and eventually die.
Diagnosis: The raised scales on the legs and feet indicate the presence of
the parasite. Confirmation is achieved by finding the mites in skin
scrapings taken from lesions. Mature adult mites are often found beneath
the crusts.
Pathology: The parasites pierce the skin underneath the scale, causing an
inflammation with exudate that hardens on the surface and displaces the
scales.
Epidemiology: Infection may remain latent for a long time with a small
static mite population until stress, such as chill or movement to a new
environment, occurs, and the population increases. The condition is more
common in birds allowed access to the ground and, therefore, tends to be
1274
more prevalent in barnyard and deep-litter systems rather than in caged
production facilities. The mites are highly contagious.
Treatment: For 'scaly leg', the legs should be dipped into an acaricide
intervals. Birds can be treated by dipping the legs in a bath containing
HCH (0.1%), sulphur solution (10%) or sodium fluoride (0.5%). Oral or
topical ivermectin may also be effective.
Table 7.10 Mites of domestic and wild birds: there are a large number of
closely related species of feather, follicle and quill mites that may be
found on a wide range of birds. Quill mites may be found within the shaft
of living feathers whereas feather mites are located externally, usually at
the base of the feather. Feather follicle mites are found in the feather
follicles of the skin. The mites cause restlessness and feather plucking.
Treatment and control may be achieved through the application of
acaricides such as pyrethrum, trichlorfon, dichlorvos; oral or topical
ivermectin or selamectin may also be effective.

Description and life cycle: In Megninia ginglymura the male has greatly
enlarged third legs and large posterior lobes with copulatory suckers. The
female has all legs of similar size.
Hosts: A wide range of birds including chickens, pigeons and
passeriformes
Pathology: Dermatitis with secretion. Records of economic damage by
these mites are rare, but up to 20% decrease in egg production has been
reported with heavy infestation.

Laminosioptes cysticola
Common name: Subcutaneous mite, fowl cyst mite
Predilection site: Subcutaneous tissues, lung, peritoneum
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
1276
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Laminosioptidae
Description, gross: Laminosioptes cysticola is a small, oval mite,
approximately 250 μm in length.
Description, microscopic: The posterior two pairs of legs end in claws
and suckerless pedicels, while the anterior two pairs of legs end in claws
(Fig. 7.46). This mite has a smooth, elongated body and few setae. The
 gnathosoma is small and not visible when viewed from above.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey and pigeons, occasionally in wild birds
Fig. 7.46 Adult female Laminosioptes cysticola, ventral view (reproduced
from Baker et al., 1956).
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, hexapod larva, followed by
octopod protonymph, tritonymph and adult. All developmental stages
1277
occur on the host. However, life cycle details are lacking- The mites are
found in the subcutaneous muscle fascia and in deeper tissues in the lungs,
peritoneum, muscle and abdominal viscera.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. It is abundant in Europe and is
also found in the USA, South America and Australia
Pathogenesis: Laminosioptes is not usually associated with clinical signs
and is only discovered at meat inspection, when infected carcases are
condemned partly on aesthetic grounds and partly because the infection
appears somewhat similar to avian tuberculosis.
In the following checklists, the codes listed below apply:
Heiminth ciasses:
N = Nematoda; T = Trematoda; C = Cestoda; A = Acanthocephala.
Arthropod classes:
[= Insecta; A = Arachnida.
Protozoal ciasses:
M = Mastigophora; S = Sarcodina; A = Apicomplexa; R = Rickettsia.
Clinical signs: The parasites are not usually regarded as pathogenic
although occasionally neurological  signs including circling,  loss of
balance, wing droop, and death have been reported.
Diagnosis: The nodules may be seen in living birds by parting the breast
feathers and sliding the skin back and forth with the fingertips.
Examination of the nodules under a dissection microscope usually allows
the identification of the mite species.
Pathology: Aggregations of these small, oval mites are found in yellow
nodules, several millimetres in diameter, in the subcutaneous muscle
fascia and in deeper tissues in the lungs, peritoneum, muscle and
abdominal viscera. The subcutaneous nodules are often calcified, but these
only contain dead mites as the calcareous deposits are produced around
the mites after they have died. Active mites occur in the deep tissues. The
nodules created by the mites reduce the value of meat intended for human
consumption.

Epidemiology: It is estimated that around 1% of free- living urban
pigeons harbour Laminosioptes cysticola. The mode of transmission of
this mite is unknown.

ABOMASUM
A number of ostertagian parasites are found in the abomasa of various
deer hosts. The identification of individual species is beyond the scope of
this book and interested readers will need to consult a relevant taxonomic
specialist. There are several species of cattle or sheep nematodes, which
are described in more detail under the chapters for these hosts (Table 8.1)
 o i  o ss     
parasites in deer. Worm burdens in deer are generally light with lesions in
the abomasum resembling those of ostertagiosis in cattle. Clinical disease
is uncommon in free-ranging deer and occurs uncommonly in captive
recommended for cattle or higher. Both benzimidazoles and macrocyclic
lactones have been shown to be effective against gastrointestinal
nematodes in deer.

SMALLINTESTINE
A number of intestinal species have been reported in deer (Table 8.2) but
are generally of little clinical significance. The majority of these are
parasites of cattle or sheep and are described in more detail under the
chapters for these hosts.
A range of protozoa similar to those present in other ruminants is found in
the intestine of deer. A number of Eimeria species have been reported in
several species of deer but their significance is not known ( Table 8.3)

Life cycle: The adult flies are active from June to September and, like

then darts in and ejects larvae in fluid into the nostrils of the host animal.
The larvae migrate to the retropharyngeal pouches. There they become
attachedin clusters and develop. Further development occurs in the
nasopharynx, as the larvae migrate to and crowd in the retropharangeal
pouches that lie on either side of the throat at the base of the tongue. Fully
developed, third-stage larvae, which may be 40 mm in length, crawl to the
anterior nasal passages and are sneezed out. Pupation occurs on the
ground under surface debris. The pupation period is about 4 weeks. The
adult flies have no mouthparts for feeding so they are short-lived and mate
shortly after emerging-

Epidemiology: C. trompe is considered to be a serious problem in
domestic reindeer management in Scandinavia. It is estimated that in
Sweden the losses due to C. trompe and the warble fly Oedemagena
tarandi equate to approximately 15% of the income from reindeer
production.
Treatment: Nose bots are generally well tolerated in wild hosts and
treatment is not usually required.
Dictyocaulus viviparus
Predilection site: Bronchi, trachea
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are slender thread-like worms; males
measure around 4.0-5.5 cm and females 68 cm in length.
Description, microscopic: The buccal ring is triangular in shape.
First-stage larvae are 300-360 μm with the intestinal cells containing
numerous chromatin granules.
Hosts: Cattle, buffalo, deer (red deer) and camel

Life cycle: The life cycle is as described under cattle. The prepatent
period in red deer is 20-24 days and larvae are excreted for approximately
25 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Larval migration produces only a mild inflammatory
response in the lungs. Thus, larger numbers of immature worms reach the
pulmonary bronchi and heavy burdens of mature worms are well tolerated.
Clinical signs: [n contrast with D. viviparus infection in cattle, coughing
is not a common sign of affected red deer. Clinical signs commonly
associated with lungworm infection are loss of condition, dull coat as well
as inappetence, reduced weight gains, fever, increased tachycardia and
tachypnoea, dyspnoea and death in severe cases.
Diagnosis: Presumptive diagnosis of infection can be made on clinical
signs if young susceptible deer develop respiratory  problems  or
inappetence. On postmortem examination, the diagnosis is confirmed by
finding large numbers of lungworms and mucus in pulmonary airways and
pneumonic changes in the lungs. Mature D. viviparus infection can be
detected by recovery of first-stage larvae from faecal samples by the
Baermann technique (see Chapter 15).

Treatment: Benzimidazole anthelmintics and macrocylic lactones are
generally effective at increased dose rates.
Control: The importance and widespread occurrence of D. viviparus
infection in farmed red deer has prompted a number of recommendations
for its control. Clinical disease is exacerbated by stressors such as
malnutrition and transport and often associated with high stocking
pasture where cattle have grazed. Any introduced deer should be treated
on arrival and then 3 and 6 weeks later. Live lungworm vaccine has been
used as a preventative.

PARASITES OF THE LIVER
Fascioloides magna
Common name: Large American liver fluke
Predilection site: Liver and bile ducts
Parasite class: Trematoda
Family: Fasciolidae
Description, gross: Flukes are large and thick and measure up to 10 × 2.5
cm. The flukes are oval, with a rounded posterior end. They possess no
anterior cone and when fresh are flesh-coloured (Fig. 8.1).
Description, microscopic: Eggs are large, operculate, measure 109-168 x
75-96 μm and have a protoplasmic appendage at the pole opposite the
operculum.
Final hosts: Deer, cattle, sheep, goat, pig, horse
Intermediate hosts: A variety of freshwater snails, Fossaria spp,
Lymnaea spp,Stagnicola sp
Life cycle: The life cycle is similar to that of F. hepatica. The eggs hatch
to miracidia after 4 weeks or longer. Development in the snail takes 7-8
weeks. The prepatent period in deer is around 30 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Mainly occurs in North America, central,
eastern and southwestern Europe, South Africa and Mexico

1304
Fig. 8.1 Fascioloides magna.
Clinical signs: In deer and cattle the parasites can cause hepatic damage
on reaching the liver but the flukes rapidly become encapsulated by the
host reaction and clinical signs are minimal.
Diagnosis: This is based primarily on clinical signs. The presence of cysts
and the large flukes are usually seen on postmortem examination. Faecal
Pathology: In deer, encapsulated thin-walled fibrous cysts are found in
the liver parenchyma.
Epidemiology: The various snail intermediate hosts tend to occur in
stagnant semi-permanent water that contains large amounts of dead or
dying vegetation, swamp areas, or pools and streams. F. magna is
indigenous to North America and is common in Canada and the Great
Lake areas where the white-tailed deer and the elk are commonly infected.
Treatment: For cattle and sheep the commonly used flukicides such as
triclabendazole, closantel, clorsulon and albendazole are effective. Mature
F. magna are susceptible to oxyclosanide.

Control: Elimination of the snail intermediate hosts is difficult due to
their varied habitats.
Notes: F. magna is primarily a parasite of deer (Cervidae) and is
commonly found in white-tailed deer, elk and moose.

SYSTEM
Elaphostrongylus cervi
Synonym: Elaphostrongylus rangiferi
Predilection site: Connective tissue, CNS
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Metastrongyloidea
Description, gross: The mature worms are long and slender. Males are up
to 40 mm long; and females up to 60 mm long-
Description, microscopic: First-stage larvae have a dorsal spine on the
tail.
Final hosts: Red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreoius),

Hypoderma diana
Common name: Warble fly
Predilection site: Subcutaneous skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
Description, adults: Adult female Hypoderma diana are about 15 mm in
length and  bee-like  in appearance;  the  abdomen  is covered  with
yelloworange hairs with a broad band of black hairs around the middle
The adults have no functioning mouthparts.
Description, larvae: The mature larvae are thick and somewhat
barrel-shaped, tapering anteriorly. When mature they are 25-30 mm in
length and most segments bear short spines. Larvae are dirty white in
   i   a     
The pupa is almost black. The larvae are relatively host specific and live
as subcutaneous parasites of deer.
Hosts: Deer
Life cycle: Females emerge with all their eggs fully developed. They have
a relatively short lifespan in which they do not feed, and are able to mate
and oviposit soon after emergence. Mating takes place off the host at
aggregation points where females are intercepted in flight. The female
lays between 300-600 eggs on the lower regions of the legs and lower
body of the host animal, where they are glued to the hairs.
The first-stage larvae are less than 1 mm in length, hatch within a week
and crawl down the hairs, either burrowing directly into the skin or into
the hair follicles. The larvae then continue to burrow beneath the skin.
Hypoderma diana migrates below the skin along nerves to the spinal cord.
After about 4 months, usually by autumn, larvae reach the epidural fat of
the spine in the region of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, where they
overwinter. Next spring, migration is resumed until, about 9 months after
swelling (the ^warble') is formed and a small hole is cut to the surface. A
1315
cystic nodule then begins to form around each larva. The larva reverses its
position and rests with its two posterior spiracles close to the opening in
the warble, allowing the larva to breathe. In this location the larva moults
twice, during which time it grows rapidly, more than doubling in length.
Larval migration and growth take place in the host until April. The larvae
then drop off the host animal and pupate in soil. The fly emerges after
approximately 36 days. The duration of pupation depends on ambient
temperature and ground cover; higher pupal survival occurs when there is
at least some grass cover and where the ground does not freeze.

Pathogenesis: The fly is most active in May and June, but it is not
recognised as a cause of 'gadding’ in deer. The mature larvae occur
subcutaneously along the back, and hide damage occurs with linear
perforations.
Clinical signs: Except for poor growth in severe cases, the hosts show no

on the spinal cord can cause paralysis. When the larvae reach the skin on
the animal's back, large, soft, painful swellings of up to 3 mm diameter
develop. The larvae lie in cysts containing yellow purulent fluid.
Diagnosis: The presence of the larvae under the skin of the back of deer
allows diagnosis of warble flies. The eggs may also be found on the hairs
Of the animals in the summer.
Pathology: Warble larvae induce a pronounced tissue inflammation. The

such as mixed, deciduous and coniferous forests, wooded steppes and
wetlands. The adult fly is most active in May and June, particularly on
warm, sunny days. The main factors influencing the flight and oviposition
they are most active at midday. As in other species, the extent of
parasitism and prevalence are higher in younger animals, possibly due to a
 um nuo padan ynor dn q shpe ui ausin jo ans
parasite. The degree of parasitism in male deer is usually higher than in
females and castrated animals.
Treatment: Like other species, Hypoderma diana is highly susceptible to
systemically active organophosphorus insecticides and to the macrocyclic
lactones Ivermectin, doramectin, eprinomectin and moxidectin.
Control: For farm-raised deer a control programme may be implemented,
with regular treatment timed in relation to the local population dynamics
of Hypoderma. Animals may be given some protection by being herded
into corrals, shelters or shaded areas to reduce the risk of infestation when
adult flies are active.
It is more difficult to develop effective control measures for diseases in

live. For free-range deer that cannot be captured, food may be

supplemented with oral forms of antiparasitic preparations. However, care
must be taken in selecting a suitable food medium for the antiparasitic
agent, since it cannot be freely distributed around the environment

Notes: With the success of control measures against warbles in cattle it is
important to realise that H. diana, although capable of infecting many
species of deer, will not infect cattle. As a consequence of this, even in
parasitic larvae, cattle are not at risk.
Hypoderma tarandi
Synonym: Oedemagena tarandi
Common name: Reindeer warble
Predilection site: Subcutaneous connective tissue
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
Description: Large, hairy flies with reddish yellow hairy abdomens.
Mature, third-stage larvae are approximately 25 mm in length.
Hosts: Reindeer, musk ox and caribou
Life cycle: The life cycle of Hypoderma tarandi resembles that of other
species in the genus Hypoderma. They are active in July and August, each
female laying between 500 and 700 eggs, which are attached to the downy
undercoat rather than the outer hair. The flanks, legs, and rump are
preferential laying sites. After approximately 6 days the egg hatches on
the skin, and the larva then burrows into and under the skin. Unlike other
subcutaneous connective tissue via the spine. When the larva comes to rest
in about September to October, a swelling (warble) is created around it
where it feeds on the animal's blood and body fluids. The L3 makes a
cutaneous perforation and the larvae breathe by applying their spiracles to
the aperture. When growth is completed in the spring, the larva leaves the
1318
reindeer through its air hole and drops to the ground to pupate. It then
emerges as an adult fly, completing the cycle.
Geographical distribution:  Circum-arctic  and subarctic  regions  of
Europe, Asiatic Russia and America
Pathogenesis: The adult flies cause gadding, and the newly hatched
larvae may cause dermatitis with local oedema when they penetrate the
skin. The main importance of this genus, however, is economic, from
damage to hides by the L3. In Sweden this loss can amount to a fifth of the
total income from reindeer herds. Up to two hundred holes may be found
in typically infested reindeer skins in Russia.

Diagnosis: The presence of the larvae under the skin of the back allows
diagnosis of warble flies. The eggs may also be found on the hairs of the
animals in the summer.
Pathology: Warble larvae induce a pronounced tissue inflammation. The
cellular reacton is predominantly eosinophilic and lymphocytic. The
presence of the larvae also induces the production of a thickened
connective tissue lined cavity surrounding the larva, filled with with
inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils.
Epidemiology: Fawns and yearlings are most affected by this parasite,
which produces large oedematous swellings. These swellings may
suppurate and attract blowflies, which then oviposit in the wound.
Treatment: Injectable ivermectin, doramectin, eprinomectin

ECTOPARASITES
LICE
Lice infestations are frequently encountered in deer. It is beyond the scope
of this book to provide detailed descriptions of all the species of lice that
may be encountered on deer throughout the world. Some of the more
common species that may be encountered are provided in Table 8.6.
Treatments with  insecticides, such as  carbaryl, cypermethrin,
deltamethrin, diazinon, lindane, and malathion, are usually effective in
controlling lice on deer. Insecticidal dust bags or *back rubbers’ can be
used as self-dosing rubbing stations for deer, and other ungulates. Because
louse populations on most temperate ungulates increase during the cooler
months, insecticides should ideally be administered to them in the autumn/
winter months. Avermectins are generally less effective against chewing
1320
lice but may be effective against sucking lice. Animals destined to be
introduced into established herds should be quarantined and where
necessary treated.

Studies on the helminth parasites of camels are few, and published
information consists mainly of case reports and lists of reported helminths.
Many of the species reported are accidental infections with parasite
species of domestic ruminants and their significance and pathogenicity are
generally not known. The most important species, against which treatment
is targeted, is the camel stomach worm Haemonchus fongistipes. This
nematode, either alone or in mixed infections with Trichostrongylus spp,
may cause a debilitating and sometimes fatal condition.Limited
information is available on  the efficacy of anthelmintics against
gastrointestinal nematodes in camels. Benzimidazoles and ivermectin
given at cattle dose rates have reported efficacy against a number of
reported as less effective against Nematodirus and Trichuris spp.
Monthly treatments of young animals during the rainy season can help
reduce parasitic burdens. Removal of faeces around watering points and
keeping these areas dry can also reduce numbers of infective larvae.
ABOMASUM
Haemonchus longistipes
Common name: Camel stomach worm
Predilection site: Abomasum
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: Relatively small worms; males are 10-20 mm and
females 18-30 mm.
Description, microscopic: Females have a reduced knob-like vulval flap
(c.f. H. contortus which has a well developed linguiform vulvar flap).
Hosts: Camel
Life cycle: As for H. contortus in cattle and sheep
Geographical distribution: Africa, Middle East
1323
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: H. longistipes worms are voracious
blood-suckers producing symptoms similar to H. contortus in domestic
emaciation and death.
Epidemiology: The epidemiology is similar to that reported with
haemonchosis in domestic ruminants. The prevalence of this parasite
drop in prevalence during the dry season.
Camelostrongylus mentulatus
Predilection site: Abomasum, small intestine

Eimeria bactriani
Synonym: Eimeria nolleri
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Host: Camel (Bactrian, dromedary)
Description: The oocysts are spherical to ellipsoidal, pale yellow-brown,
and oocyst residuum. Sporocysts are spherical or elongate, 8-9 × 6-9 μm
with a residuum. Meronts in the small intestine are 16 x 10 μm and
contain 20-24 merozoites; mature microgamonts are 25 × 20 μm.
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically coccidian with endogenous stages
found in the small intestine, although the number of merogony stages is
unknown. Sporulation time is 9-15 days.
Geographical distribution: Germany, CIS (Russia and former Soviet
States)
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Not reported
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and the demonstration of
0ocysts in diarrhoeic faeces.
Epidemiology: Unknown
Treatment and control: Little is known about treatment, but by analogy
with other hosts, one of the sulphonamide drugs should be tried if disease
is suspected. Prevention is based on good management, avoidance of
1330
overcrowding and stress, and attention to hygiene, particularly watering
areas, which should be protected from faecal contamination.

especially in the female. The thorax is reddish brown, with a black pattern.
 s a    s    e 
yellow.
Description, larvae: The first-stage larvae are about 0.7 mm in length and
have long spines on the lateral edges of the segments. L2 are about 15 mm
1335
smooth fleshy lobes on each segment and large mouth-hooks.
Hosts: Camels
Life cycle: Eggs are laid around the nasal area. Larvae hatch and migrate
into the nasal cavity, frontal sinus and pharynx of their host, where they
spend several months feeding and moulting. When mature, the larvae
make their way back to the nose, considerably irritating the camel in the
process. As a result they are sneezed out on to the ground, and from here
the larvae burrow into the ground and pupate. Pupation takes about 25
days.
Geographical distribution: Occurs over entire range of both species of
camels: sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, Australia and Asia.
Pathogenesis: The larvae irritate and damage the mucosa. Camels snort,
emergence of mature larvae from the nostrils. When large numbers of
      se  d  
severely impaired. Unlike many oestrids, adult Cephalopina do not panic
the animals, and large numbers are often seen resting on the head and
around the nostrils.
Clinical signs: Snorting, sneezing, increased grooming, nasal discharge,
bleeding from the nostrils, coughing and reduced milk production and
body weight.
Diagnosis: The adult flies may be visible and recognisable on the host.
The eggs are also easily identifiable on the host. Larvae present in the
pharynx may be seen on direct inspection.
Pathology: The larval phase usually occupies about ll months, and is
associated with inflammation, sometimes purulent, of the nasopharyngeal
mucosa.
Epidemiology: Infestation of up to 90% of camel herds has been
recorded.
Treatment: Macrocyclic lactones, rafoxanide, trichlorphon and nitroxynil
titillator.
1336
Control: The most effective means of control of this parasite is to remove
the eggs from the host's coat. This requires, where possible, daily
examination of the animal, paying particular attention to the area around
the nostrils.

Synonym: Trypanosoma evansi, T. equinum
Common name: Surra, el debab, mbori, murrina, mal de caderas,
doukane, dioufar, thaga
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Zoomastigophorasida
Family: Trypanosomatidae
Hosts: Horse, donkey, camel, cattle, zebu, goat, pig, dog, water buffalo,
elephant, capybara, tapir, mongoose, ocelot, deer and other wild animals.
Many laboratory and wild animals can be infected experimentally.
Geographical distribution: North Africa, Central and South America,
central and southern Russia, parts of Asia (India, Burma, Malaysia,
southern China, [ndonesia, Phillipines)
Treatment and control: Suramin or quinapyramine (Trypacide) are the
drugs of choice for treatment and also confer a short period of
prophylaxis. For more prolonged protection a modified quinapyramine
resistance, at least to suramin, is not uncommon. Currently in camels,
isometamidiumis administeredintravenouslybecause of local tissue
reactions.
Notes: The original distribution of this parasite coincided with that of the
camel, and is often associated with arid desserts and semiarid steppes.

ECTOPARASITES
Microthoracius cameli
Common name: Camel sucking louse
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Microthoraciidae
Description: Microthoracius cameli have a very characteristic elongated
spindle-shaped head, which is almost as long as its swollen, rounded
abdomen (Fig. 8.5). The entire body is 1-2 mm in length.
Hosts: Camel
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical, with eggs giving rise to three nymphal
stages followed by the reproductive adult. However, little precise detail is
known.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, in association with its host
Pathogenesis: These lice are blood-feeders and heavy infestations can
significantly reduce weight gain and milk production.
Clinical signs: The signs of infestation are variable. Light infestation may
have no obvious effects, but pruritis, dermatitis and hair loss are usually
evident at heavier parasite loads.
1351
Diagnosis: The lice and their eggs can be seen on the skin of the host
animal when the hair is parted.
Epidemiology: Infection occurs after direct contact with an infested host
the animals have physical contact.
Treatment and control: Macrocyclic lactones, such as moxidectin, in a
Microthoracius. Three species parasitise llamas. The fourth species
Microthoracius cameli is parasitic on camels. The closely related
Microthoracius mazzai is an economically important parasite of alpacas

Diagnosis: The lice can be seen in the hair of the host animal when the
Epidemiology: Infection usually occurs after direct contact with an
infested host animal. Cross-contamination between different host species
a contaminated environment or grooming equipment as the lice can
survive for short periods off the host.
Treatment and control: Dips, dusts and sprays containing coumaphos,
malathion or permethrin may be effective, particularly if applied after
shearing. Macro-cyclic lactones, such as ivermectin, doramectin and
moxidectin, given in a repeated treatment programme of 7-10 days may
also be highly effective.

RABBITS
PARASITES OF THE DIGESTIVE
SYSTEM
Helminth infections are rarely seen in domestic rabbits unless they are
kept in conditions that expose them to the infective stages resultant from
contact with wild rabbits. The following species, with the exception of
Passalurus, are therefore generally only found in wild rabbits and
treatment of domesticated rabbits for many of these parasites is therefore
rarely indicated. When treatment is required, fenbendazole and
mebendazole are effective. In-feed medication with flubendazole can also
be given over 10 days.
A more detailed list of helminth species found in both domesticated and
wild rabbits is provided in the parasite checklist at the end of the chapter.
Graphidium strigosum
Common name: Rabbit strongyle
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
1380
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are reddish worms when fresh, with 40-60
longitudinal lines and fine, transverse striations. The male is 8-16 mm,
and female 11-20 mm long.
Description, microscopic: The male bursa has large lateral lobes and a
small dorsal lobe. Spicules are long, slender and each ends distally in
several points. Eggs are typically trichostrongyle, 0void and 98-106 x
5058 μm.
Hosts: Rabbit, hares
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. Infection is by ingestion of infective
larvae, which develop to the adult stage in the stomach in about 12 days.
Geographical distribution: Europe
heavy infections cause destruction of the gastric mucosa, diarrhoea,
anaemia, emaciation and sometimes death if untreated.
Diagnosis: This is based on identification of the eggs in the faeces or
adult worms in the stomach on postmortem.
Obeliscoides cuniculi
Predilection site: Stomach
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are brownish red worms; the male is
10-16 mm, and female 15-18 mm long.
Description, microscopic: The male spicules are brown, and bifurcated at
the distal end. The body of the female is tapered over the posterior 20% of
 x         s
μm.
Hosts: Rabbit, hare and occasionally white-tailed deer
1381
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. Infection is by ingestion of infective
Geographical distribution: USA
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Similar to G. strigosum
Diagnosis: This is based on identification of the eggs in the faeces or
adult worms in the stomach on postmortem.
Trichostrongylus retortaeformis
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Trichostrongyloidea
Description, gross: The adults are small, white and hair-like, usually less
than 7.0 mm long and difficult to see with the naked eye.
Description, microscopic: In the male, the ventro-ventral ray tends to be
terminate in a barb-like tip (see Table 3.l). The females possess double
Ovejectors.
Hosts: Rabbits, hares
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct and typically trichostrongyle
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
causing desquamation, and in heavy infections inflammation of the
intestine with excess mucous exudate.
Diagnosis: This is based on clinical signs, seasonal occurrence of disease
and, if possible, lesions at postmortem examination. Faecal egg counts are
a useful aid to diagnosis, although faecal cultures are necessary for generic
identification of larvae.
1382
TAPEWORMS
Gross: Tapeworms of the genus Cittotaenia are up to 80 cm long and 1
cm wide.
Microscopic: Proglottids are broader than long and each contains two sets
of genital organs. Eggs are about 64 μm in diameter and have a pyriform
apparatus.
Intermediate hosts: Forage mites, mainly of the family Oribatidae.
Life cycle: Mature proglottids or eggs are passed in the faeces and on to
pasture where the oncospheres are ingested by forage mites. The embryos
migrate into the body cavity of the mite where they develop to
cysticercoids. Infection of the final host is by ingestion of infected mites
during grazing.
contaminated grass.
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Heavy infections may cause digestive
disturbances, emaciation and occasionally death in affected rabbits.
Diagnosis: This is based largely on the presence of mature proglottids in
the faeces.
Cittotaenia ctenoides
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Anoplocephalidae
Deseription, microscopic: The scolex is about 0.5 mm wide
Final hosts: Rabbit
Geographical distribution: Europe
Cittotaenia pectinata
Predilection site: Small intestine
1383
Parasite class: Cestoda
Family: Anoplocephalidae
Description, microscopic: The scolex is smaller (0.25 mm) than that of
C. ctenoides.
Final hosts: Rabbit, hare
Geographical distribution: Europe, Asia, America
OXYURID WORMS
Passalurus ambiguus
Common name: Rabbit pinworm
Predilection site: Caecum, colon
Class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Oxyuridoidea
Description, gross: Adult worms are 4-ll mm in size and
semitransparent; males are 4-5 mm and females 9-11 mm.
oesophageal bulb. Eggs are thin-walled, with slightly flattened walls on
0ne side and measure 95-103 × 43 μm
Hosts: Rabbit, hare
Life cycle: Development is direct and infection occurs through the
ingestion of infective eggs. Immature stages are found in the mucosa of
the small intestine and caecum.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Rabbits can harbour large numbers of oxyurid worms with
no clinical signs. These worms can be a problem in rabbit colonies.
Treatment and control: Single treatments are not very effective because
of the direct life cycle and rapidity of reinfection. Fenbendazole at 50 mg/
kg in feed for 5 days is effective.
1384
COCCIDIOSIS
There are 11 species of coccidia affecting rabbits (Table 9.1). The
intestinal species, E. flavescens and E. intestinalis, are the most
pathogenic causing the destruction of crypts in the intestine resulting in
diarrhoea and emaciation with disease commonest around weaning.
Coccidial infections are seen commonly on commercial rabbit farms.

examination. Species identification is based on pathological lesions and
location within the intestine. identification is possible on oocysts
recovered from faeces
 following sporulation.
In practice, the
demonstration of many oocysts in the faeces is often used as an indication
that rabbits require treatment.
Treatment and control: A number of coccidiostats are available for
prophylactic use, including robenidine and clopidol. Sulphonamides
(sulphadimidine or sul-phaquinoxaline) are used for treatment, usually
given as two 7-day courses in drinking water, 1 week apart to allow for
the possibility of reinfection. Control of rabbit coccidiosis involves the
daily cleaning of cages, hutches or pens and the provision of clean feeding
troughs. In many large units, control is achieved by rearing animals on
1385
wire floors, or alternatively, coccidiostats such as amprolium, clopidol or
robenidine are incorporated in the feed.
Eimeria flavescens
Predilection site: Small and large intestine (Fig. 9.1)
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Fig. 9.1 Predilection site of Eimeria flavescens.
Life cycle: There are five merogony stages. The first-generation meronts
are in the glands of the lower small intestine, the second-to
fifth-generation meronts are in the caecum and colon. The second-,
  gn  ui  s o 
     s   s  
and gametes appear about 7 days, and oocysts appear in the faces about 9
days after infection. Sporulation time is 4 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
1386
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: E. flavescens is highly pathogenic for
young rabbits, causing high morbidity and mortality and is a major
problem on commercial rabbit farms.
Pathology: There is thickening of the intestinal wall of the caecum and
colon with petechial haemorrhages and loss of epithelium in the caecum
and colon.
Eimeria intestinalis
Predilection site: Small intestine (Fig. 9.2)
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Life cycle: There are three merogony stages. First-generation meronts are
at the base of the villi in the lower ileum. There appear to be two types of
second-generation meronts in the distal part of the villi, followed by

Entamoeba cuniculi
Predilection site: Caecum
Parasite sub-phylum: Sarcodina
Family: Endamoebidae
Description: Trophozoites are 20-30 μm in diameter. The cysts are 10-33
 μm in diameter and contain a single nucleus.
Hosts: Rabbit
Life cycle: Trophozoites divide by binary fission. Before encysting the
amoebae round up, become smaller and lay down a cyst wall. Each cyst
1398
has one nucleus. Amoebae emerge from the cysts and grow into
trophozoites

Retortamonas cuniculi
Synonym:Embadomonascuniculi
Predilection site: Caecum
Parasite sub-phylum: Mastigophora
Family: Retortamonadorididae
Description: Trophozoites are ovoid, 7-13 × 5-10 μm, with an anterior
flagella and a posterior trailing flagella emerging from the cytosomal
groove and occasionally have a tail-like process. Cysts are pyriform or
ovoid, 5-7 × 3-4 μm.
Hosts: Rabbit
Life cycle: Reproduction is by binary fission. Infection occurs by
ingestion of the cyst stage.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Non-pathogenic
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on the identification of the characteristic
trophozoites.

intestine and migrate to the liver via the lymph vessels. Merogony occurs
above the host cell nucleus in the epithelial cells of the bile ducts. The
number of asexual generations is uncertain, but there appear to be at least
six. In due course, some merozoites form macrogametes and others form
microgamonts. The latter produce large numbers of comma-shaped
biflagellate microgametes. These fertilise the macrogametes which lay
down an oocyst wall, break out of the host cell and pass into the intestine
with the bile, and then out in the faeces. The prepatent period is 18 days
and the patent period 21-30 days. The sporula-tion time is 2-3 days.
1401
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: This species, which occurs in the bile
ducts, reaches the liver via the portal vein and then locates in the
epithelium of the bile ducts where it results in a severe cholangitis.
Grossly the liver is enlarged and studded with white nodules. Some of the
symptoms seen are due to interference with liver function. Mild cases may
be asymptomatic. In more severe infections the animals become
inappetant and lose weight. There may be diarrhoea, jaundice, ascites and
polyuria. The symptoms may become chronic, or death may occur in
21-30 days. Clinical signs of E. stiedai infection include wasting,
diarrhoea, ascites and polyuria.
Fig. 9.13 Gamonts of Eimeria stiedai within hyperplastic bile duct
epithelium.
Pathology: The liver may become markedly enlarged, and white circular
nodules or elongated cords may be visible. These nodules are sharply
initially circumscribed, but later coalesce. The bile ducts are grossly
enlarged and are filled with developing parasites. There is pronounced
hyperplasia of the bile duct epithelial cells, and the epithelium is thrown
into folds. Each cell contains one or more parasites (Fig. 9.13).

PARASITES OF THE NERVOUS
SYSTEM
Encephalitozoon cuniculi
Synonym:Nosema cuniculi
Predilection site: Blood
Class: Microsporasida
Family: Nosematidae
Description: Microsporidia are obligate, intracellular, spore-forming
protozoa. Trophozoites are 2-2.5 × 0. 8-1.2 μm in tissue sections or 4 x
2.5 μm in smears. Spores are about 2 μm long and contain a spirally coiled
polar filament with four to five coils.
Hosts: Rabbit, dog, red fox (Vulpes vuipes), blue fox (Alopex lagopus),
silver fox, cat, mouse, rat, man
Life cycle: The infective spore stages are highly resistant and can survive
for many years. When spores are ingested, the polar tube is everted and
when fully extended the sporoplasm passes through the tube and is
innoculated into the cytoplasm of the host cell. There then follows a phase
of multiplication by binary or multiple fission (merogony). This is
followed by sporogony to form sporoblasts, which then mature into
spores.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: In rabbits, infection is very common causing granuloma
formation in the kidneys, liver and brain. Infection in the brain causes
convulsions, tremors, torticollis, ataxia, urinary incontinence, coma and
death.
Clinical signs: Many infected rabbits are asymptomatic, although clinical
signs such as head tilt, urinary incontinence, posterior paresis and anterior
uveitis have been reported.
1404
Diagnosis: Diagnosis in the live animal is difficult and is usually based on
identifying  the lesions on histopa-thology and observation of the
organisms in Giemsa, Gram's or Goodpasture-carbol fuchsin stains. A
serum ELISA test is available.
Pathology: In the rabbit, microscopic lesions consist of focal granulomas
and pseudocysts in the brain and kidneys, with occasional severe, focal
interstitial nephritis.
Epidemiology: Transplacental infection occurs in rabbits and rodents, but
ingestion of spores. Evidence suggests that in many countries, infection in
rabbits is common.
Treatment: Treatment with benzimidazoles (fenbenda-zole, oxfendazole
and albendazole) has been reported in rabbits. Fenbendazole is given at 20
mg/kg and albendazole 15 mg/kg for 28 days. Corticosteroids may
suppress granulomata formation, and should be used with caution.
Control: Control in rabbits depends on testing individuals, isolation and
treatment. The primary source of infection is urinary excretion and
ingestion of spores. Strict hygiene should therefore be followed with
raised food dishes and use of water bottles rather than bowls. Rabbits
should not be housed in tiered hutches where urine contamination of cages
below is common.
Notes: There are reports of E. cuniculi acting as a zoonosis, particularly in
immunocompromised individuals.

ECTOPARASITES
MITES
Psoroptes cuniculi
Synonym: Psoroptes ovis, Psoroptes cervinus, Psoroptes bovis, Psoroptes
equi
Common name: Ear canker mite
Predilection site: Ears
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes(Astigmata)
Family: Psoroptidae
Description: Mites of the genus Psoroptes are nonburrowing mites, up to
d sl a l (ty ) aus us ao pu aul un  9o
beyond the body margin. Its most important recognition features are the
funnel-shaped suckers (pulvilli).
Adult females have jointed pretarsi and pulvilli on the first, second and
fourth pairs of legs and long, whiplike setae on the third pair. In contrast,
1407
the smaller adult males, which are recognisable by their copulatory
suckers and paired posterior lobes, have pulvilli on the first three pairs of
legs and setae on the fourth pair. The legs of adult females are
approximately the same length, whereas in males the fourth pair is
ex tremely short.
The Psoroptes mite described as P. cuniculi is found primarily in rabbits,

causing irritation and head shaking, and also in sheep associated with
haematomas.
In adult Psoroptes cuniculi, the outer opisthosomal setae are, on average,
slightly shorter than those seen in P. ovis. Nevertheless, the usefulness of
this character is questionable, since there is considerable variation and
 a p 'so  a aq a a go s a i deo
length of the setae of mites is known to decrease with the age of a body
lesion. It appears very likely that P. cunicufi is simply a host-adapted
population of the species P. ovis.
Hosts: Rabbit, goat, sheep and horse
Life cycle: The eggs of Psoroptes cuniculi are relatively large (about 250
μm in length) and oval. The hexapod larva, which hatches from the egg, is
about 330 μm long. The larva moults into a protonymph, the protonymph
moults into a tritonymph and the tritonymph moults to become an adult.
Egg, larval, protonymph and tritonymph stages and the adult
 pre-oviposition period each require a minimum of 2 days to be completed,
giving a mean egg to adult time of about 10 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
may occur at relatively low intensities, but occasionally proliferate
blocked with greyish debris. If untreated, the infection may extend over
the rest of the body with scabs, loss of hair and excoriation from
scratching. The initial preclinical stages may last for several months,
problems to the infested rabbit. Mites are nonburrowing and therefore are
found only in exudate, not in tissue.
1408
Clinical signs: In the initial stages of the infection, small skin scales
 shn s s  'ss go su    
blood. If untreated the scales begin to crust and may eventually grow to a
thickness of 1o mm and fill the ear in severe cases. Scratching behaviour
and shaking of the head may occur, and scabs and loss of hair may be
   jo o s  s a ag s an  
over the rest of the body.
Diagnosis: A sample of scab should be taken from the infected area.
When placed in a glass jar or beaker the highly mobile mites will leave the
scab and start to migrate up the sides of the jar. Mites can then be
collected and examined under a microscope for key features: oval outline,
all legs projecting beyond the body margin, three-jointed pre-tarsus.
Pathology: At low population densities, little pathology may be evident.
In a rapidly expanding population, however, there may be chronic erosive
and proliferative eosinophilic dermatitis.
Epidemiology: When in its preclinical phase deep in the ear, transmission
is uncommon. However once the infestation has spread transmission is
more likely, primarily through physical contact but also may occur via the
environment.
Treatment: Treatment is as for otodectic mange of cats and dogs.
injected ivermectin is highly successful. The infected bedding should be
burnt and the housing thoroughly disinfected. The crust will resolve itself,
without the need to clean the ears, falling off approximately 10 days after
the first treatment.
Control: All in-contact animals should be treated. The housing must be
disinfected to prevent reinfection. Regular inspection of the animal,
paying particular attention to the ears, should help to control the parasite
and reduce the effects of subsequent infestations.
Cheyletiella parasitivorax
Common name: Rabbit fur mite
1409
Predilection site: Most commonly found on the dorsum, above the tail
and on the neck, but may occur all over the body.
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Cheyletidae
Description: Adults are about 400 μm in length and ovoid (Fig. 9.14)
They have blade-like chelicerae that are used for piercing their host, and
possesses a long, serrated dorsal seta. The body tends to be slightly
elongated with a 'waist'. The legs are short; tarsal claws are lacking and

Three very similar species of Cheyletiella are of veterinary importance
and are common: Cheyletiella yasguri on dogs, C. blakei on cats and C.
parasitivorax on rabbits. All three species are morphologically very
similar. However, the solenidion, on the genu of the first pair of legs, is
described as globose in C. parasitivorax, conical in C. blakei and
heart-shaped in C. yasguri. Nevertheless, this feature can vary in
individuals and between life cycle stages, making precise identification
difficult. Identification to genus and knowledge of the host is usually
sufficient for diagnosis, but it is important to be aware of the potential for
crosstransmission of the various species of Cheyletiella from other
in-contact hosts.
Host:Rabbit
Life cycle: All developmental stages occur on the host animal. Eggs are
glued to hairs 2-3 mm above the skin. A prelarva and then a larva develop
within the egg, with fully developed octopod nymphs eventually emerging
 ss  o    s a  a m
1411
the adult stage is reached. The life cycle is completed in approximately
two weeks. The mites live in the hair and fur, only visiting the skin to feed
epidermis with their stylet-like chelicerae. Adults can survive for at least
10 days off the host without feeding, or longer in cool environments.
Geographical distribution:  Worldwide, particularly  North America,
Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
Pathogenesis: Cheyletiella is relatively common in rabbits, but the mite is
not highly pathogenic at low densities and is often found in young animals
in good physical condition. It is a characteristic of the dermatitis caused
by Cheyletiella that many skin scales are shed into the fur, giving it a
powdery or mealy appearance, and the presence of moving mites among
this debris has given it the common name of *walking dandruff. There is
          a 
    s     
European rabbits.
Clinical signs: Infestation can result in eczema-like skin conditions and
associated pruritus and hair loss. Severe cases may show serous exudate
and extensive alopecia.
Diagnosis: In any case of excessive scurf or dandruff, Cheyfetiella should
be considered in the differential diagnosis. On parting the coat along the
back, and especially over the sacrum, scurf will be seen, and if this is
combed out on to dark paper the movement of mites will be detected
among the debris. Skin scraping is not necessary as the mites are always
on the skin surface or in the coat.
Pathology:  The pathology of Cheyletieila infestation is poorly
understood. In many cases there is very little skin reaction or pruritus.
However, in severe cases rabbits may show alopecia with red, scaly skin
and dermatitis with hyperkeratosis.
rabbits. It is highly contagious and can spread rapidly through rabbit
colonies. Transmission is usually by direct contact with infested animals
although the parasite can survive for over 10 days off the host, therefore
bedding and housing can act as a source of infestation.
1412
Treatment:
  Topical
1acaricides,  such as  pyrethrin  and
dichlorvos-containing sprays, are effective against Cheyletiella. Systemic
          
Selamectin spot-on has also been used effectively. Fipronil should only be
used with great caution because it has been associated with deaths in some
cases.
Control: All in-contact animals should be treated, bedding replaced and
housing disinfected.
Notes: Of all the mite infestations of domestic animals, this is one of the
most readily transferable to humans. The mites can penetrate clothing and
are easily transferred, even on short periods of contact. It is often found
persistent skin rash in the owner's family. In contrast to the condition in
its natural hosts, the infestation in humans causes severe irritation and
intense pruritus. The early sign is an erythema, which may progress to a
vesicular and pustular eruption. Cases in humans invariably clear up
spontaneously when the animal source has been treated.

FLEAS
Spilopsyllus cuniculi
Common name: Rabbit flea, European rabbit flea
Predilection site: Ears
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Siphonaptera
Family: Pulicidae
Description: The rabbit flea, S. cunicufi, has both pronotal and genal
ctenidia, the latter being composed of four to six oblique spines. Adults
are dark brown, and females are, on average, 1 mm in length; males are
slightly smaller. Eyes are present and the frons at the front of the head is
beneath the eye (Fig. 11.27).
1414
Hosts: Rabbit,hare, dog,cat
Life cycle: The rabbit flea, S. cunicufi, occurs largely on the ears. It is
periods with its mouthparts embedded in the host. The life cycle of this
species is believed to be mediated by host hormones imbibed with the host
blood. The presence of progesterones inhibits or delays flea maturation.
Following mating, the adult female rabbit ovulates and, about 10 days
before parturition, the levels of oestrogens and corticosteroids in the blood
increase. These hormones cause the fleas to attach tightly to their host and
stimulate development of the eggs of the female flea. Reproductive
hormones of the pregnant female host stimulate maturation of the ovaries
and oocytes of feeding female fleas and testicular development in males.
 aop d e uo ea ae ad Ao uo s as
serves to synchronise the life cycles of the flea and its host and results in
the emergence of adult fleas at the same time as a new litter of host
animals are born. The adult fleas become ready to mate when the litter is
born: an airborne kairomone emanating from the newborn rabbits and
their urine boosts copulation. The hormones of the host also cause adult
fleas to increase the rate of feeding and defecation by about five times.
This provides an abundance of food in the burrow for the newly hatched
larvae. Oviposi-tion occurs soon after adults have transferred on to the
newborn young. The larvae feed on organic matter in the nest debris and
mature 15-45 days later when they infest the host littermates before they
         
dramatically during the rabbit breeding season.
Adult female fleas on bucks or non-pregnant does are more mobile and
 sdn e ui s au e  s   o 
rabbit mating will also stimulate movement of fleas from one rabbit to
another.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: When rabbits are not breeding, the distribution of S.
cuniculi is related to skin temperature, with fleas usually congregating on
the ears. Because they assemble here in large numbers, the intensity of
bites may cause considerable irritation and tissue damage.
1415
The rabbit flea may also be found on cats and dogs, which hunt or
frequent rabbit habitats. On these hosts they are commonly found on the
face and attached to the pinneal margin.
Spilopsyffus cuniculi is the main vector of myxomatosis and it also
transmits the non-pathogenic Trypanosoma nabiasi.
Clinical signs: These fleas may cause a great deal of irritation and tissue
damage at the congregation sites on the ears.
Diagnosis: The fleas may be seen on the skin of the host animal,
particularly around the ears. They have a more sedentary habit than most
fleas, and will remain on the ear even when it is handled.

Echidnophaga galinacea|See Chapter 7: Poultry and gamebirds
Treatment: Imidacloprid may be used in rabbits to kill adult fleas on
contact. Fipronil should only be used with extreme care in rabbits due to
its potential toxicity.
Control: Not usually necessary. In case of repeated infestation the source
should be identified and contact prevented; all in-contact animals should
be treated; bedding should be replaced and housing disinfected.

Family: Calliphoridae
Description, adults: Lucilia sericata blowflies measure up to 10 mm in
length and are characterised by a metallic greenish to bronze sheen.
Description, larvae: Larvae are smooth, segmented, and measure 10-14
mm in length. They possess a pair of oral hooks at the anterior extremity,
Hosts: Mainly sheep, but a range of other domestic and wild animals may
be affected including humans.
Life cycle: Female blowflies lays clusters of 225-250 yellowish cream
eggs on wounds or soiled hair, attracted by the its odour. The eggs hatch

condition in rabbits and death may result within a few days.
Clinical signs: [nfested animals show extensive skin ulceration, shock,
weakness, depression, lethargy and anorexia.
Diagnosis: This is based on the clinical signs and recognition of maggots
in the lesion.
Pathology: Struck animals have a rapid increase in body temperature and
respiratory rate. The animals show extensive tissue damage, become
anaemic and suffer severe toxaemia.

Eimeria caviae
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Eimeriidae
Description: Oocysts are ellipsoidal or ovoid, smooth, brown, 13-26 x
12-23 μm, without a micropyle, or polar granule but with a residuum.
Life cycle: Following ingestion of oocysts, sporozoites enter the intestinal
epithelium to become first-generation meronts. Following a further three
intestine leading the excretion of oocysts in the faeces. The prepatent
period is about 7 days and the patent period approximately 4-5 days.

Pathogenesis and clinical signs: E. caviae is usually non-pathogenic but
may occasionally cause diarrhoea and mortality. Clinical signs include
unthriftiness, poor weight gain in young animals; droppings are slimy and
contain blood.

containing oocysts.
Epidemiology: Crowding and lack of good sanitation promote spread of
coccidiosis. Breeding establishments and rescue centres are potential
sources of infection. Older guinea pigs are generally immune from disease
but may seed the environment with oocysts leading to infection in young
animals that have no previous exposure.
Treatment: Information on treatment in the guinea pig is scanty, although
by analogy with other host species, the use of sulphonamides, such as
sulphamezathine, should be tried.
1419
Control: Good sanitation and isolation are effective measures in
preventing coccidiosis. If possible, guinea pigs should be housed on wire
floor cages to reduce the incidence of infection. Standard disinfectants are
ineffective against coccidial oocysts but ammonia-based products are
effective.
Cryptosporidium wrairi
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Cryptosporidiidae
Deseription: Mature 00cysts are ovoid, 4.8-5.6 × 4.0-5.0 μm (mean 5.40
x 4.6 μm), with a length:width ratio of 1.17. First-generation meronts are
3.44.4 μm when mature and contain eight merozoites; second-generation
meronts contain four merozoites. Developing macrogametes are 4-7.0 μm
in size.
Life cycle: Oocysts, each with four sporozoites, are liberated in the faeces
Following ingestion, the sporozoites invade the microvillous brush border
of the enterocytes and the trophozoites rapidly differentiate in 3-4 days to
form meronts with eight merozoites followed by a second merogony stage
containing four merozoites. Gametogony follows after two generations of
meronts usually around 13-15 days post infection. The prepatent period
has not been reported.
Geographical distribution: Unknown
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: The infection has only been reported in
small guinea pigs (weighing 200-300 g) and is not associated with
diarrhoea or overt signs of disease. Clinical signs are usually inapparent.
Diagnosis: Oocysts may be demonstrated using Ziehl-Nielsen-stained

LARGEINTESTINE
Paraspidodera uncinata
Predilection site: Large intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Ascaridoidea
Description, gross: Male worms are 16-1 7 mm and females 18-21 mm.
Description, microscopic: The egg is ellipsoidal, 43 × 31 μm
Host: Guinea pig
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. Eggs passed in the faeces are infective
after 3-5 days. When ingested they migrate to the caecum and colon and
mature in about 45 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Generally considered non-pathogenic,
although heavy infections may cause weight loss, debility and diarrhoea.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on identification of eggs in the faeces or
adult worms in the large intestine.
1421
Epidemiology: This caecal worm occurs naturally in the caecum and
colon of the wild guinea pig in South America and in laboratory guinea
pigs around the world. Infection is usually associated with guinea pigs
housed in outdoor runs.
Treatment and control: Piperazine at 3 g/l in the drinking water for 7
days is effective. Ivermectin at 200-500 μg given subcutaneously is also
likely to be effective. Control is based on good hygiene and management.
A number of protozoa are found in the caecum of the guinea pig. All are
considered non-pathogenic. Entamoeba caviae and Tritrichomonas caviae
are common in the caeca of laboratory guinea pigs.
Entamoeba caviae
Predilection site: Caecum
Parasite class: Sarcodina
Family: Endamoebidae
Description: Trophozoites are 10-20 μm in diameter. The nucleus, when
stained has a central or eccentric endostome with a ring of relatively
and contain eight nuclei when mature.
Tritrichomonas caviae

Klossiella cobayae
Predilection site: Kidney
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Klossiellidae
Deseription: The mature zygote is 30-40 μm in diameter and produces 30
or more sporocysts each containing about 30 sporozoites.
Host: Guinea pig
Life cycle: The life cycle is not clearly understood. Within epithelial cells
of kidney tubules, trophozoites form meronts and merozoites. Merozoites
enter the epithelial cells of the convoluted tubules of the kidney, where
they form gamonts. Fertilised gametes are believed to develop into
sporonts, which bud to form sporoblasts. Each of these sporoblasts
undergoes  successive  divisions  to  form  sporocysts  that  contain
sporozoites. Mature sporocysts are surrounded by a thick wall and pass
from the body in the urine. When ingested by another host, the sporozoites
1424
are released from the sporocyst, move to the kidney, where they enter
epithelial cells and initiate the cycle.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis  and   clinical   signs:  Although   usually  considered
non-pathogenic, a chronic to subacute nephritis with degenerative lesions
has been described.
Diagnosis: Sporocysts may be detected in urine sediments or trophozoite
stages may be found on postmortem in the kidney. The site and location
are pathognomonic.
Pathology: Only heavily parasitised kidneys have gross lesions, which
appear as tiny grey foci on the cortical surface. Microscopically these foci
are areas of necrosis, with perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells,
Epidemiology: Sporocysts are passed in the urine and infection takes
place by the ingestion of the sporulated sporocysts.

stages followed by the reproductive adult. However, little precise detail is
known.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Fig. 9.16 Adult female Gyropus ovalis (from Séguy, 1944)
1426
Pathogenesis: This species tears pieces of skin until blood pools and then
feeds from these pools. Underlying skin may be dry or oily and thickened
or crusty. Severely infected animals may show secondary bacterial
infection and stress, including weight loss. Infestation often accompanies
manifestations of poor health, such as internal parasitism, infectious
disease, malnutrition and poor sanitation.
Clinical signs: The signs of infestation are variable. Light infestation may
have no obvious effects, but pruritis, dermatitis, scratching and hair loss
are usually evident at heavier parasite loads.
Diagnosis: The lice and their eggs can be seen on the skin of the host
animal when the hair is parted.
Epidemiology: Infection occurs after direct contact with an infested host
animal. Cross-contamination between different host species is possible if
the animals have physical contact.

Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Listrophoridae
Description: Mites of the family Listrophoridae are soft-bodied, strongly
striated with a distinct dorsal shield, and have mouthparts and legs
modified for grasping hairs. Females of Chirodiscoides caviae are about
500 μm and males about 400 μm in length. The gnathosoma is distinctly
triangular. The propodosomal sternal shield is strongly striated and used to
clasp hairs (Fig. 9.18). The body is flattened dorsoventrally. All legs are
slender and well developed, with legs I and Il strongly modified for
clasping to hair.

Pathogenesis: These are burrowing mites, and the burrowing activity
results in irritation, inflammation and pruritus, causing biting, scratching
and rubbing of the infested areas and leading to alopecia. The infestation
Death may occur within 3-4 months of infestation. Transmission is by
close physical contact and from mother to offspring.
Clinical signs: Infestation causes irritation, biting, scratching, rubbing and
general restlessness.
Diagnosis: Confirmatory diagnosis is by examination of skin scrapings
for the presence of mites. However, since these are sometimes difficult to
demonstrate, a negative finding should not preclude a tentative diagnosis
of mange and initiation of treatment.
Pathology: Affected areas display marked acanthosis and hyperkeratosis
and may become secondarily infected with bacteria.
Treatment: Ivermectin may be administered twice at 7-to 10-day
intervals.
Control: All bedding must be replaced, and housing and the guinea pig's
local environment thoroughly cleaned.

Epidemiology: Internal autoinfection occurs in humans; but infection in
rodents usually involves an intermediate host. Under conditions of poor
hygiene infected rodents will contaminate food with their faeces, leading
to human infection. In addition such an environment will support the
intermediate hosts. Human prevalence is highest in children.
Treatment: Not usually indicated. Niclosamide mixed in powdered feed

Cryptosporidium muris
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Cryptosporididae
Description: Oocysts are small, ovoid, 7.4 × 5.6 μm and contain four free
sporozoites.
Trophozoites attached to the surface of a gland cell consist of a small
amount of cytoplasm with a nucleus, and often appear to be surrounded by
a cyst wall (peri-trophic membrane). The maturing first-generation
      x       s
Microgametocytes are 5 x  4 μm and contain 16 microgametes;
macrogametocytes are 7 x 5 μm.
Hosts: Rat, mouse, hamster, squirrel, Siberian chipmunk, wood mouse
(Apodemus syivaticus), bank vole (Clethrionomys glareoius), Dolichotis
patagonum, rock hyrax, Bactrian camel, mountain goat, man and
cyno-molgus monkey
Life cycle: Oocysts, each with four sporozoites, are liberated in the faeces.
Following ingestion, the spo-rozoites invade the microvillous brush border
of the gastric glands and the trophozoites rapidly differentiate to form
meronts with four to eight merozoites. Gametogony follows after two
generations of meronts and oocysts are produced in 10-l8 days post
infection.
1444
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Infections in rodents appear to cause
few pathogenic effects and infections are usually asymptomatic.
Diagnosis: Oocysts may be demonstrated using Ziehl-Nielsen-stained
Speciation of Cryptosporidium is difficult, if not impossible, using
conventional techniques. A range of molecular and immunological
techniques has been developed, that include the use of ELISA. More

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
1446
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Infections are generally asymptomatic
but have been reported to cause chronic enteritis in young mice.
Diagnosis: Giardia cysts can be detected in faeces by a number of
methods. Traditional methods of identification involve direct examination
of faecal smears, or faecal concentration by formalin-ethyl acetate or zinc
sulphate methods and subsequent microscopic examination. It is generally
recommended that three consecutive samples be examined as cysts are
excreted intermittently.
Pathology: The pathology has not been described. There may be villous
atrophy, crypt hypertrophy and an increased number of intraepithelial
concave surface to the brush border of epithelial cells.
animal-to-animal contact and faecal contamination are the most likely
methods of transmission, although water contamination can also be
considered as a possible route.
Treatment and control: Metronidazole at 0.5% in the drinking water for
10 days is reported to be effective. As infection is transmitted by the
faecal-oral route, good hygiene and prevention of faecal contamination of
feed and water are essential
Spironucleusmuris
Synonym:Hexamita muris,Octomitusmuris,Syndyo-mitamuris

the anterior end, and six anterior and two posterior flagella. There is no
cytostome.
Hosts: Mouse, rat, hamster
1447
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Infection causes enteritis and diarrhoea
in laboratory rodents. With chronic infections there is weight loss and
listlessness and diarrhoea is uncommon.
Diagnosis: Identification of characteristic trophozoites in mucosal smears
smears stained with Giemsa.
Pathology: Lesions are generally confined to the anterior small intestine
with inflammation of the duodenum, and the duodenal crypts are cystic
and filled with trophozoites of S. muris.
Epidemiology: Infection is common in  some rodent colonies.
Transmission presumably occurs by ingestion of trophozoites or cysts
from faeces or by faecal contamination.
Treatment and control: Control relies mainly on good hygiene and
management in rodent colonies and culling of animals with symptoms of
diarrhoea unresponsive to treatment, or those showing chronic weight
loss.
LARGEINTESTINE
Pinworms
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct. Females deposit embryonated eggs on
the perineal skin. Infection occurs in three ways:
1. Directly by ingestion of embryonated eggs from the perineum
2. Indirectly with food
migrate back via the anus.
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Pinworms are relatively common but
non-pathogenic parasites in the large intestine of laboratory rodents.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on identification of oocysts in the faeces.
Epidemiology: Crowding and lack of good sanitation promote spread of
infection.
1448
Treatment: Treatment can be with either piperazine (4-7 g/ml) given as
three separate 7-day courses in drinking water; or ivermectin at 0.4 mg/kg
for 3-4 weeks.

PARASITES OF THE
CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Angiostrongylus costaricensis
Predilection site: Mesenteric arteries and arterioles
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Metastrongyloidea
Description, gross: The worms are tapered at both ends and are filiform
in shape. Males measure about 20 mm and females 30-40 mm in length.
The spicules are equal in length, slender and striated.
Description, microscopic: The cephalic ends of the spicules are blunt and
the caudal tips are pointed. A gubernaculum is present. The ovoid eggs
layed in the mesenteric arterioles are thin-shelled, transparent and
unembryonated. The embryonated eggs shed in faeces measure around 90
μm.
Definitive hosts: Rodents, common in the cotton rat. Can also infect man
Intermediate hosts: Terrestrial molluscs such as slugs and snails. The
slug Vaginuius plebius is the main intermediate host for infection in the
cotton rat and man.
Life cycle: Larvae are shed in the faeces of the rodent and are ingested by
a mollusc in which development to the L3 stage takes place. Following
ingestion of the mollusc by rats, or ingestion of vegetation that is
contaminated with infective mucous trails, the L3 migrate via the
lymphatics. After two moults the worms migrate to the ileocaecal arteries
where they mature, reproduce and lay eggs, which are then carried to the
intestinal wall. Eggs embryonate, hatch to L1 larvae and migrate to the

In man, the adult parasites are frequently present in the ileocaecocolic
arteries where they induce a thickening of the intestinal wall and a
granulomatous eosinophilic inflammatory response. The syndrome is
termed abdominal angiostrongylosis.
Epidemiology: The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is the most common
definitive host in the Americas. Infection of man in endemic areas is
probably through accidental ingestion of infected slugs on vegetables or
salads or via infected mucous trails on green vegetation.
Treatment: Anthelmintic treatment is not advised in man
Control: This is not practical in rodents. Control of slugs and rodents and
greater public awareness of the zoonotic disease should reduce infection in
man. Thorough washing of vegetables and salad greens is important.

bladder tumours associated with infection.
Pathology: The female worms occur either free in the urinary bladder or
are embedded in the bladder wall. The presence of the worms can cause
granulomatous lesions in the lungs, and white nodules in the bladder wall.
Epidemiology: Transmission in laboratory animals occurs from parents to

Treatment and control: Not reported
Klossiella muris
Predilection site: Kidney
1461
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Klossiellidae
Description: Sporocysts measure 16 x 13 μm and contain 25-34
sporozoites.
Hosts: Mouse
Life cycle: The life cycle is not clearly understood. Within epithelial cells
of kidney tubules, trophozoites form meronts and merozoites, of which
there are two types. One forms 8-l2 merozoites and the other 40-60
merozoites. Merozoites enter the epithelial cells of the convoluted tubules
of the kidney, where they form gamonts. Fertilised gametes are believed
to develop into sporonts, which bud to form sporoblasts. Each of these
sporoblasts undergoes successive divisions to form sporocysts that contain
sporozoites. Mature sporocysts are surrounded by a thick wall and pass
from the body in the urine. When ingested by another host, the sporozoites
are released from the sporocyst, move to the kidney, where they enter
epithelial cells and initiate the cycle.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Infections in mice appear to cause few
pathogenic effects and are usually asymptomatic.
Diagnosis: Sporocysts may be detected in urine sediments or trophozoite
stages may be found on postmortem in the kidney. The site and location
are pathognomonic.
Pathology: Only heavily parasitised kidneys have gross lesions, which
appear as tiny grey foci on the cortical surface. Microscopically these foci
are areas of necrosis, with perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells,
especially lymphocytes with an increase in interstitial fibroblasts.

Myocoptes musculinus
Predilection site: Fur
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Listrophoridae
Description: These mites are soft-bodied, strongly striated with a distinct
dorsal shield, and have mouth-parts and legs modified for grasping hairs
(Fig. 9.24). Adult female Myocoptes musculinus are elongated ventrally,
about 300 μm in length, and the propodo-somal body striations have

spine-like projections. The genital opening is a transverse slit. The anal
opening is posterior and ventral. Legs I and II are normal, possessing
    l  s  s  s  s
less pronounced striations and a greatly enlarged fourth pair of legs for
grasping the female during copulation. The posterior of the male is
bilobed.
Hosts: Mouse, but will also infest guinea pigs.
Life cycle: Myocoptes musculinus spends its entire life on the hair of the
host rather than on the skin, feeding at the base of the hair and gluing its
eggs to the hairs. The life cycle is typical: egg, hexapod larva, followed by
octopod protonymph, tritonymph and adult. All developmental stages
occur on the host. The entire life cycle requires around 14 days.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: This mite causes myocoptic mange in wild and laboratory
mice. It is extremely widespread but is usually of little pathogenic
significance. Problems may occur, however, in crowded laboratory
colonies or in animals in poor condition. Lesions are often found along the
head and neck and between the shoulder blades. With heavy infestation,
mice may scratch constantly, leading to self-induced skin trauma and
alopecia.
Clinical signs: Infestation may be asymptomatic, or the mite may cause
inflammation, scaling,
, crusting, and pruritic dermatitis, leading to
scratching and alopecia.
Diagnosis: For confirmatory diagnosis, skin scrapings or coat brushings
must be examined for eggs and mites.
Pathology: Infestations may be asymptomatic, but the mite may cause
erythema, inflammation, scaling, crusting, pruritic dermatitis with
secondary alopecia. Chronic cases may develop secondary bacterial
infection.

Life cycle: The female oviposits amongst the fur, cementing the eggs to
the base of the hairs. Eggs hatch within 8 days, and the larvae moult four
days later. The egg-to-adult life cycle requires a minimum period of 12
days. All stages feed on extracellular fluids.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Light infestations are asymptomatic and
hence often go unnoticed. Larger mite populations result in alopecia,
dermatitis, pruritus and a harsh coat. The preferred site of infestation is the

morphologically similar to M. musculi, but can be distinguished by the
presence of two tarsal claws as opposed to just one (Fig. 9.26). Radfordia
1468
ensifera produces intense itching, leading to scabs most frequently seen on
the shoulders, neck,and the face.
Alargenumber of other closelyrelatedspecies of mitesmayalso
occasionally be found on rats and mice (Table 9.5); treatment and control
are as for Myocoptes musculinus. Distinguishing between individual
genera and species is beyond the scope of this text.

LICE
Polyplax spinulosa
Predilection site: Fur
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
1469
Parasite sub-order: Anoplura
Family: Polyplacidae
Description: These lice are slender, 0.6-l.5 mm in length and
yellow-brown in colour. The head bears prominent, five-segmented
antennae, no eyes and no ocular points (Fig. 9.27). There is a distinct
sternal plate on the ventral surface of the thorax. The forelegs are small
and the hindlegs are large with large claws and tibial spurs. The abdomen
has 7-13 dorsal plates, and approximately seven lateral plates on each
side. The egg is elongated, with a cone-like operculum.
Hosts: Mouse,rat
Life cycle: The lice spend their entire life cycle in the host and
 sp g inoqe ui y sa au r y q snoo uissn
give rise to three nymphal stages, followed by the reproductive adult. The
first nymphal stage is found on the entire body, while older stages are
            
completed in about 2 weeks.

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: These blood-sucking lice are commonly encountered in
   n  s  n    s
irritation, restlessness and constant scratching, particularly behind the
ears. Anaemia, unthrifty appearance and debilitation occur in heavy
infestations.
Clinical signs: Pruritus, restlessness, debilitation and anaemia.
Diagnosis: Adult lice, nymphs or eggs may be found on the fur.
Treatment and control: Lice may be killed by most organophosphates
(such as diazinon, malathion methoxychlor) and pyrethroids (such as
permethrin). Topical application of fipronil or imidocloprid or systemic
ivermectin may also be highly effective, but care must be taken because
adverse effects to ivermectin have been reported in some strains of mice.

Common name: Spined rat louse
Predilection site: Fur
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera

head carries a row of three setae below the eye. The frontal tubercle on the
inner surface of the hind femur. The body is elongated and about 3-4 mm
in length.
Fig. 9.28 The northern rat flea, Nosopsyllus fasciatus, male head (after
Smart, 1943).
1473
Hosts: Rat, mouse, humans
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, three larval stages, pupa and
5°C. Larval stages are found only in the nest or burrow. The larvae of this
species may pursue and solicit faecal blood meals from adult fleas. The
larvae grasp the adult in the region of the sensilium using their large
mandibles. Adults respond by defecating stored semi-liquid blood, which
is then imbibed by the larvae directly from the anus.
Geographical distribution: Although originally European in distribution,
the northern rat flea, Nosopsyffus fasciatus, has now been transported to
temperate habitats worldwide.
Pathogenesis: Its main hosts are rodents, particularly the Norway rat,
gophers and many other hosts. The northern rat flea will attack and feed
on humans, although it is not thought to be an important vector of plague.
It is known to be a vector of Hymenoiepis diminuta in parts of Europe,
Australia and South America.
1474
Clinical signs: Symptoms include restlessness and scratching of affected
            
seen, but should be differentiated from other similar conditions such as
sarcoptic mange.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is not easy as adults may leave the host and eggs
and larvae are difficult to find. The bites of these fleas are similar to those
of mosquitoes, lice and mites, with inflammation and itchiness.
Epidemiology: Nosopsyllus fasciatus fleas are not host specific and may
attack any available mammal or bird for a blood meal. As they are able to
survive off the host, transmission can occur from the bedding and housing.
This flea is highly mobile on the host and can be especially common in
host nesting material.
Treatment: Several organophosphorus, carbamate and pyrethrin-based
insecticides are effective. Imidacloprid and fipronil may be highly
effective and kill adult fleas on contact.
Control: Should this species become established in pet rats or mice the
animal should be treated, all litter and bedding should be removed and
burnt and the cage sprayed with an insecticide. If there is invasion of other
domestic hosts or humans from wild animals, the source must be
eradicated.
Xenopsylla cheopis
Common name: Oriental or black rat flea
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasiteorder:Siphonaptera
Family: Pulicidae
Description: Xenospylla cheopis resembles P. irritans in that both genal
and pronotal ctenidia are absent (Fig. 9.29). The head is smoothly rounded
anteriorly. The flea has a light amber coloration. The maxillary laciniae
The segments of the thorax appear relatively large and the pleural ridge is
1475
present in the mesopleuron of the thorax. There is a conspicuous row of
bristles along the rear margin of the head and a stout ocular bristle in front
oftheeye.
Hosts: Rat, humans; this species may also infest mice, cottontail rabbits
and ground squirrels.
Life cycle: The life cycle of X. cheopis is typical: egg, three larval stages,
pupa and adult. Eggs are usually laid in the environment rather than on the
animal host. Eggs are laid in batches of about 3-25 a day, with a female
laying 300-1000 eggs 0ver a lifespan that may be from 10 days to more
 s t    o   sg  e 
actively on organic debris. The duration of the larval stage depends upon
local conditions. The most important environmental variable is humidity
and larvae may die if they move outside a narrow range; humidities above

and up to 38 days without food, if humidity is high. Adult males and
females can take several blood meals a day. If the host dies, the flea
moves almost immediately to find a new one.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. The distribution of the Oriental
rat flea, X. cheopis, largely follows that of its primary host the black rat,
Rattus rattus. It has a worldwide distribution and is one of the most
abundant fleas in the southern states of the US. It is particularly common
in urban areas.
Pathogenesis: The bites of the flea may prove irritating to the host animal
causing it to scratch and rub itself. Xenopsylla cheopis is also an
intermediate host of helminths, such as Hymenolepis diminuta and H.
nana. Xenopsylla cheopis is the main vector of Yersinia pestis, the cause
1477
of bubonic plague in man. X. cheopis acquires Y. pestis when feeding on
 an i s   i i  sis s 
becomes blocked so that blood cannot be ingested; the hungry flea moves
from host to host in attempts to feed, and in its wanderings the infection
may be transferred from its endemic base in rodents to the human
population. Bacteria secreted in faeces may also enter a host through
abrasions. Though now rare in humans, plague still exists in wild rodents
('sylvatic plague') in parts of Africa, Asia, South America and the western
states of the USA. Xenosylla cheopis is also a vector of murine typhis
(Rickettsia typhi). In the case of typhus, the disease is only transmitted by
rickettsia in faeces. However, the pathogen can invade the ovary, leading
to its transovarial transmission, via eggs.
Clinical signs: The adult fleas may be seen on the skin and coat of the
host animal. Other signs are the host scratching affected areas.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis can be achieved by identifying the flea species on
the host.
Epidemiology: The fleas are able to survive off the host for long periods.
laboratory or pet rats and mice so their presence may indicate that there is
contamination by wild rodents.
Pathology: Flea feeding does not appear to produce histopathology at the
flea feeding sites nor does the elevated basophilic blood response of
infested rats affect subsequent feeding or longevity of the fleas.
Treatment: A wide range of products is available to treat infested hosts.
Imidacloprid and fipronil may be used in rats to kill adult fleas on contact.
        
effective longer-term alternative.
Control: For optimal control nesting material must be removed and
replaced, the housing treated and reinfestation from the environment or
introduced animals prevented
Leptopsylla segnis
Common name: Mouse flea
Predilection site: Fur
1478
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Siphonaptera
Family: Leptopsyllidae
Description: In the adult there are both genal and pronotol ctenidia, and
the genal ctenidium contains only four spines.
Hosts: Mice and rats
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, three larval stages, pupa and
adult. Eggs and larvae are found in the hosts nest and the adults are
obligate blood-feeders on the host animal. The adult fleas live for
approximately 20 days on the host. The entire life cycle may be completed
in 3-4 weeks under ideal conditions or 2 years under adverse conditions.
Geographic distribution: Europe and on the east and west coasts of the

FLIES
Cuterebra
Common name: New World skin bot flies
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae (sub-family Cuterebrinae)
1479
covered by dense, short hairs, and have a blue-black-coloured abdomen.
They have small, non-functional mouthparts and do not feed as adults.
       
numerous strong body spines.
s
Life cycle: Females lay eggs on the ground near or within the entrance of
host nests, or on grass near trails used by hosts. These are picked up by the
passing host. The larvae enter the body, directly through the skin or
through one of the orifices such as the nose, and then migrate
subdermally. At their final, species-specific resting site the larvae
eventually form a warble-like swelling. In rodents the warble is often
formed near the anus, scrotum or tail. Larval development may require
between 3 and 7 weeks. When mature, the larvae leave the host and drop
to the ground where they pupate.
Geographical distribution: New World
Pathogenesis: Species of the genus Cuterebra are largely dermal parasites
of rodents and rabbits, but may occasionally infest dogs and cats. The
larvae cause subdermal nodules. They are not commonly seen in
laboratory colonies, but may be found in animals maintained out of doors.
Clinical signs: Symptoms include the swellings and lesions made by
larvae.
Diagnosis: The presence of one or more superficially situated swellings
made after extraction and identification of the larvae.
Pathology: In the warble formed around each larva, a thin layer of
necrotic tissue develops and the larva feeds off the tissue debris and
exudate. In general, the cuterebrid species are of little economic veterinary
importance. However, occasional fatal cases of infestation have been
recorded in cats and dogs.
Epidemiology: 26 species are known to occur in the USA and Canada.
They are also found in Mexico and the neotropical regions; however, the
taxonomy of this genus is not yet clearly defined. In most regions there is
1480
only a single generation per year, adults are active in spring and summer
and they overwinter as pupae in the ground.
Treatment: Surgical removal of larvae can be performed relatively easily
if required for infected captive animals. The cyst opening should be
enlarged by incision and the parasite excised. The wound should then be
rinsed with an antiseptic solution and a topical antibiotic administered.
Control: Area-wide control is impractical and for long-term management
areas of known fly activity should be avoided.

undulating membrane does not reach the posterior end of the body and a
free posterior flagellum is absent. An accessory filament is present. The
axostyle is narrow, protrudes 2-8 μm from the body and its anterior
portion is flattened into a spatulate capitulum. There is a crescent-shaped
pelta anterior to the axostyle and there is no chromatic ring at its point of
1486
emergence. The parabasal body is hookshaped and has a parabasal
filament and the costa is a very fine rod running three quarters the length
Of the body.
Hosts: Pigeon, turkey, chicken, raptors (hawks, falcons, eagles)
Life cycle: The trichomonads reproduce by longitudinal binary fission. No
sexual stages are known and there are no cysts.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The domestic pigeon is the primary host, but the parasite
has been found in birds of prey that feed on pigeons, and it has been
experimentally established in a wide range of other birds. T. gallinae is

Previous infection leads to a varying degree of immunity, and adult.
pigeons, that have survived infection as squabs, are symptomless carriers.
Infection with a relatively harmless strain produces immunity against
virulent strains. Injection of plasma from infected pigeons also confers
immunity.
In pigeons, trichomoniosis is essentially a disease of young birds; 80-90%
of the adults are infected but show no signs of disease. Trichomoniosis
after infection (there are strain differences in virulence).
Clinical signs: Severely affected birds lose weight, stand huddled with
ruffled feathers and may fall over when forced to move. Yellow, necrotic
lesions are present in the mouth, oesophagus and crop of pigeon squabs
and a greenish fluid containing large numbers of trichomonads may be
found in the mouth. The condition is often fatal.
Diagnosis: The clinical signs are pathognomonic and can be confirmed by
identifying the characteristic motile trichomonads from samples taken
from lesions in the mouth or from fluid.
Pathology: The early lesions in the pharynx, oesophagus and crop are
small, whitish to yellowish caseous nodules. These grow in size and may
remain circumscribed and separate, or may coalesce to form thick,
caseous, necrotic masses that may occlude the lumen. The circumscribed
disk-shaped lesions are often described as 'yellow buttons'. The lesions in
1487
the liver, lungs and other organs are solid, yellowish, caseous nodules up
to 1 cm or more in diameter.
Epidemiology: In pigeons and doves, trichomoniosis is transmitted from

raptors become infected by eating infected birds.
Treatment: Carnidazole is used for the treatment and prophylaxis of

for squabs. Other nitroimidazole compounds, such as dimetridazole and
metronidazole, are also effective, but their availability has declined in
Control: Control of trichomoniosis in pigeons depends on the elimination
 Of the infection from the adult birds by drug therapy.
Notes: Trichomonas gallinae parasitises the mouth, sinuses, orbital
region, pharynx, oesophagus, crop and even proventriculus, but is not
found beyond the proventriculus. It often occurs in the liver, and to a
lesser extent in other organs including the lungs, air sacs, heart, pancreas,
and more rarely spleen, kidneys, trachea and bone marrow.

Description: Oocysts are sub-spherical to spherical, smooth, colourless or
slightly yellowish brown, 13-24 × 12-23 μm, without a micropyle 0r a
residuum but with a polar granule. Sporocysts are elongate ovoid, with a
Stieda body and residuum. The sporozoites are slightly crescent-shaped
      
sporocysts, and have a clear globule at each end.
Hosts: Pigeon (Columba domestica), rock dove (Columba fivia), collared
dove (Streptopelia decaoto)
Life cycle: After the sporulated oocysts are ingested, the sporozoites are
released and invade the epithelial cells of the intestine. First generation
1495
meronts are present 20-48 hours after infection in the epithelial cells of
the anterior ileum. Mature second-generation meronts are present 96
hours, and mature third-generation meronts are present 144 hours after
infection. The macrogametes are in the epithelial cells of the ileum. The
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: E. labbeana is slightly to markedly pathogenic, depending
on the strain of parasite and age of the birds. Adults are fairly resistant,
     s   g  
emaciated, eat little but drink a great deal, and have a greenish diarrhoea.
The heaviest losses occur among squabs in the nest. A high percentage of
the squabs may die, and those that recover are often somewhat stunted
Clinical signs: Light infections are usually asymptomatic. In heavier
infections, birds are listless, have a puffed-up appearance, and show
weakness, emaciation and diarrhoea.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on identification of oocysts in the faeces in
Pathology: In severe infections there is inflammation of the intestinal
Epidemiology: Transmission is via the faecal-oral route and is more
common in young birds. Sources of infection include dirty contaminated
baskets, eating or drinking contaminated food or water or drinking from
 contaminated water in roosts such as roof guttering.
Treatment: Sulphonamides administered in the drinking water (e.g.
Clazuril also is effective at 2.5 mg given as an oral tablet per pigeon,
regardless of weight. All birds in the same loft are usually treated
simultaneously to prevent reinfection of untreated birds.

and weight loss. Balance may be affected in infested birds. Weakness,
emaciation and death have been described with heavy infections.
Clinical signs: Coughing, respiratory difficulties, pulmonary oedema,
weight loss, loss of balance or coordination.
Diagnosis: Positive diagnosis is only possible at postmortem, when
necropsy reveals white spots on the surface of air sacs.
Pathology: Death is usually associated with peritonitis, enteritis,
emaciation and respiratory complications.

PARASITES OF THE
CIRCULATORYSYSTEM
Leucocytozoonmarchouxi
Synonym: Leucocytozoon turtur
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Plasmodiidae
Description: Macrogametes are rounded or elliptical, stain dark blue with
Giemsa and have a compact, reddish nucleus. This species forms rounded
megaloshizonts in nearly all internal organs.
Hosts: Pigeons and doves
Life cycle: Sporozoites are introduced into a new host by the feeding
insects. Parasites undergo merogony in the endothelial cells of internal
organs forming megaloschizonts. These lead to the production of
gametocytes in the blood, which, after ingestion by the vector insect, form
zygote and oocysts. These undergo sporogony leading to the formation of
sporozoites, which pass to the salivary glands and are introduced to the
new host when the insect vectors feed.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Until recently this species was
considered non-pathogenic in pigeons and doves but the species has been
shown to be pathogenic to pink pigeons (Columba mayeri).
Diagnosis: Demonstration of gametocytes in blood smears
Epidemiology: Vectors are members of the genus Simulium (blackflies)
Treatment and control: Not usually required although general insect
control or preventative measures may limit infection.

Haemoproteus columbae
Predilection site: Blood
Parasite class: Sporozoasida
Family: Plasmodiidae
range from tiny ring forms to elongate crescent-shapes that curve around
the host cell nucleus in the form of a halter. Macrogametes stain dark blue
with Giemsa stains, the nucleus is red to dark purple and compact, and
pigment granules are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm.
Hosts: Domestic and wild pigeon, dove and other wild birds
Life cycle: Sporozoites in the salivary gland of the fly enter the circulation
of the host when the insect bites and penetrate endothelial cells of blood
vessels where they develop into meronts forming 15 or more cytomeres,
each producing large numbers of merozoites. When merozoites are mature
they are released into the circulation as tiny round bodies which transform
into  macrogametes and microgamonts  within erythrocytes.  Further
development takes place in the insect host after blood feeding. After
fertilisation, a zygote forms in the insect midgut where sporogony takes
place, forming sporozoites. These are liberated in the body cavity and pass
to the salivary glands.
Geographical distribution: North America
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Generally considered to be of low
pathogenicity in adult birds, but an acute form of infection has been
reported in sqabs. Clinical signs included anorexia and anaemia.
Diagnosis: Demonstration of gametocytes in blood smears
Epidemiology: Vectors are hippoboscid flies, Pseudolynchia.
Treatment and control: Not usually required although general insect
control or preventative measures may limit infection

Laminosioptes cysticola
Common name: Subcutaneous mite, fowl cyst mite
Predilection site: Subcutaneous tissues, lung, perotoneum
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Sarcoptiformes (Astigmata)
Family: Laminosioptidae
Description, gross: Laminosioptes cysticola is a small, oval mite,
approximately 250 μm in length (Fig. 7.46).
and suckerless pedicels, while the anterior two pairs of legs end in claws.
This mite has a smooth, elongated body and few setae. The gnathosoma is
small and not visible when viewed from above.
Hosts: Chicken, turkey and pigeon, occasionally in wild birds
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, hexapod larva, followed by
octopod protonymph, tritonymph and adult. All developmental stages
occur on the host. However, life cycle details are lacking. The mites are
found in the subcutaneous muscle fascia and in deeper tissues in the lungs,
 peritoneum, muscle and abdominal viscera.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. It is abundant in Europe and is
also found in the United States, South America and Australia.
Pathogenesis: Laminosioptes is not usually associated with clinical signs
and is only discovered in pigeons at postmortem. Active mites occur in the
deep tissues. The nodules created by the mites reduce the value of meat
intended for human consumption
1503
Clinical signs: The parasites are not usually regarded as pathogenic
feathers and sliding the skin back and forth with the fingertips.
Examination of the nodules under a dissection microscope usually allows
the identification of the mite species.
Pathology: Aggregations of these small, oval mites are found in yellow
nodules, several millimetres in diameter, in the subcutaneous muscle
fascia and in deeper tissues in the lungs, peritoneum, muscle and
abdominal viscera. The subcutaneous nodules are often calcified, but these
only contain dead mites as the calcareous deposits are produced around
the mites after they have died.
Epidemiology: It is estimated that around 1% of free-living urban pigeons
harbour Laminosioptes cysticola. The mode of transmission of this mite is
unknown.
Treatment: Macrocyclic lactones may be effective.

ECTOPARASITES
Colombicola columbae
Common name: Slender pigeon louse
Predilection site: Wings or anterior part of the body
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Phthiraptera
Parasite sub-order: Ischnocera
Family: Philopteridae
Deseription: A pale yellow, slender louse usually 2-3 μm in length.
Hosts: Pigeons and doves
1504
Life cycle: Eggs of this species are usually attached to the feathers close
to the skin. There are three nymphal stages similar to, although much
smaller than, the adult. Development of the final stage gives rise to the
fully mature reproductive adult.
Geographical distribution: Probably worldwide
Pathogenesis: Infection may cause a mild pruritus, and in common with
most pediculoses, heavy infestations are usually seen only in diseased and
debilitated birds causing feather damage and irritation.
Clinical signs: Feather damage and irritation
Diagnosis: Adult lice may be seen moving around the plumage or eggs
may be seen attached to feathers.
Pathology: Lice are rarely linked to significant pathology
Epidemiology: Infection occurs after direct contact with an infested host
animal. Cross-contamination between different host species is possible if
the animals have physical contact.
Treatment: Topical insecticidal compounds, such as permethrin, carbaryl.
malathion, cypermethrin or rot-enone, can be used to kill lice. However,
as the insecticides are unable to kill the eggs, two applications are
necessary with a 10-day interval.
Control: Although methods such as dusting the litter or providing
insecticide-treated laying boxes are used to avoid undue handling of birds,
the results obtained from treating individual birds are undoubtedly better.
Regular checking and spraying of birds will enable infestation rates to be
controlled. In addition, crosscontamination should be avoided. This is
achieved by treating any birds in the environment of the pigeons and
restricting contact between wild birds and pigeons. The housing and
nesting should be thoroughly cleaned to eliminate sources of reinfestation
such as egg-laden feathers.

segmented abdomen. They have one pair of wings, the veins of which are
crowded together towards the anterior margin. Both sexes of adult are
blood feeders. The larvae are rarely seen and measure about 5 mm in
length.
Hosts: Mainly pigeons but other domestic birds may also be infested.
Life cycle: Gravid female flies mature larvae singly. Each female can
produce only five or six larvae in its lifetime. These larvae pupate almost
immediately after larviposition. When pupation is completed, the newly
emerged winged adults locate a suitable host animal on which they
flies are most abundant in the summer months.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The adult flies bite and blood-feed, resulting in a nuisance
and disturbance. Heavily infested birds may be restless, emaciated and
become susceptible to secondary infections. They may act as vectors of
Haemoproteus coiumbae and H.sacharovi.
Clinical signs: The adult flies are clearly visible when feeding on the host
animal. Irritation at the feeding sites may be observed.
Diagnosis: The adult flies may be found on the host animal.
Epidemiology: The adult flies are most abundant on the host during the
summer months.
Treatment and control: This is best achieved by topical application of
insecticides, preferably those with some repellent and residual effect such

long with no antennal fossae. Eyes are present. There is a pronotal comb
 i  s si     n    
lateral row of four to six bristles on the inner surface of the hind femur.
description of individual species in this genus is beyond the scope of this
text.
Hosts: Pigeon
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, three larval stages, pupa and
adult. Before the female can begin ovipositing it needs to feed on the host
several times. Unlike most other fleas, which often remain on the host and
feed for long periods, pigeon fleas spend most of their time in the nest of
The larvae feed on detritus amongst the nest material, bird droppings and
on undigested blood from the adult faeces. The larval stages are completed
the cocoon and emerges in an old nest in spring as temperatures rise.
Large numbers may occur in the nests of passerine birds, and they may
complete their life cycle during the period of nest occupation by these
birds. Work has shown a negative correlation between flea abundance and
mean body mass of the brood being parasitised.
If the nest is reused by birds the following year, the newly emerged adults
will locate the new hosts, feed and continue the cycle. If the nest is not
reused, the newly emerged adults will make their way to the nest entrance,
where they may be able to attach to a bird that is examining the old nest as
a potential nest site. Alternatively, they may climb up trees and bushes,
where they stop periodically and face the brightest source of light,
jumping in response to a shadow passing in front of the light.
1507
Geographical distribution: Found predominantly in the Old World, but
has been introduced into the Americas.
Pathogenesis: Feeding activity may cause irritation, restlessness and, with
heavy infestations, anaemia. In wild birds, flea reproduction and feeding
activity is synchronised with the breeding season. Adult C. cofumbae may
also feed on humans and domestic pets.
Clinical signs: Symptoms include restlessness and scratching of affected
areas. The bites may be visible on the skin. Allergic dermatitis may be
seen.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is not easy as adults may leave the host and eggs
and larvae are difficult to find. The bites of these fleas are similar to those
of mosquitoes, lice and mites, with inflammation and itchiness.
          
available mammal or bird for a blood-meal. As they are able to survive off
the host, transmission can occur from the bedding and housing. This flea
is highly mobile on the host and can be especially common in host nesting
material. Ceratophylfus cofumbae feeds readily on humans and domestic
 pets, and is often acquired in the handling of pigeons and wild birds. It has
also been known to migrate into rooms from nests under adjacent eaves.
When such nests are removed they should be incinerated; otherwise the
underfed fleas may parasitise domestic pets and humans.
Treatment: Topical treatment of the affected birds with insecticidal
products such as permethrin, carbaryl, malathion and rotenone is effective.
Control: Should fleas become established, drastic measures may have to
be adopted to get rid of them. All litter and nest material should be
removed and burnt, and the housing sprayed with an insecticide.
Argas reflexus
Common name: Pigeon tick
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
1508
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Argasidae
Description: Species of the genus are usually dorsoventrally flattened,
with definite margins, which can be seen even when the tick is engorged.
The cuticle is wrinkled and leathery. Most species are nocturnal and are
parasites of birds, bats, reptiles or, occasionally, small insectivorous
mammals. Most species seldom attack humans. Species of this genus are
usually found in dry, arid habitats.
The adult Argas reffexus is between 6 and 11 mm in length. It may be
distinguished from the fowl tick, Argas persicus, by its body margin,
which is composed of irregular grooves, and by the hypostome, which is
not notched apically. It is reddish brown in colour with paler legs.
Hosts: Birds, mainly pigeons
Life cycle: Argas refflexus is nocturnal and breeds and shelters in cracks
and crevices in the roost structure. Females deposit batches of 50-100
eggs in these cracks and crevices. After hatching, larvae locate and attach
to a host, where they remain and feed for several days. After feeding they

moulting to the adult stage. Adult males and females feed about once a
month. Females can become completely engorged within 30-45 minutes.
All stages of these ticks remain around the roosting area, quiescent in the
day and actively feeding at night. Argas reflexus can survive in empty
roosts for more than a year. Engorged females diapause between July and
August. If oviposition has already commenced, egg-laying stops and
resumes the following year without the need for another blood meal.
Geographical distribution: Europe, Russia, Asia, north and west Africa.
Pathogenesis: Infestation may cause irritation, sleeplessness, loss of egg
productivity and anaemia, which can prove fatal. Heavy infestations can
take enough blood to bring about the death of their host. This species
transmits Borrelia anserina, the cause of fowl spirochaetosis, and
1509
Aegyptianella pullorum, a rickettsial infection. It may also be a vector of
west Nile and chenuda virus and the quaranfil virus group.
Clinical signs: Inflammation and raised areas will be present from tick
            
sleeplessness, loss of productivity and anaemia, which can prove fatal.
Diagnosis: The adult ticks, particularly the engorged larvae, may be seen
on the skin. Nymphs and adult ticks may be found in cracks of the
 go s     s s  
bites consisting of a mixed inflammatory cell response with fibrosis.
Epidemiology: Argas reflexus eggs show limited levels of cold tolerance;
winter temperatures of 3°C cause approximately 50% mortality. This
limits its northern distribution through Europe.
Treatment: Argasid ticks, which exist in lofts and enclosures, can be
controlled by application of an acaricide to their environment coupled
with treatment of the population on the host. Environmental treatment of
roosts and lofts may be effected using acaricidal sprays or emulsions
containing organophosphates or pyrethroids. All niches and crevices in
affected buildings should be sprayed, and nesting boxes and perches
should also be painted with acaricides. At the same time as premises are
treated, birds should be dusted with a suitable acaricide or, in the case of
larger animals, sprayed or dipped. Treatment should be repeated at
monthly intervals.
Control: All new animals should be treated prior to introduction into an
existingflock.

Libyostrongylus
Life cycle: The life cycle is typically strongyle. Following ingestion,
infective larvae burrow into the proventricular glands and under the kaolin
layer of both proventriculus and gizzard where they develop into adult
worms 4-5 weeks later
Pathogenesis: The young worms penetrate deeply into the mucosa of the
glands of the proventriculus. Adults live on the surface of the epithelium
(Fig. 10.2) where they feed on blood, causing a severe inflammatory
reaction and anaemia.
Clinical signs: Chicks are most susceptible to infection and become
anaemic, weak and emaciated with heavy mortality in untreated cases.
Fig. 10.2 Libyostrongylus douglassi: mucosal surface of proventriculus.
Insert shows magnified worm.
1511
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on finding eggs in the faeces or by
identifying the worms in the proventriculus and gizzard on postmortem.
Treatment: Levamisole (30 mg/kg), fenbendazole (15 mg/kg) and
ivermectin (200 μg/kg) are effective in the treatment of wireworm
infection in young ostrich.
Control:  Appropriate hygiene  and  husbandry  measures, including
removal of faeces aimed at limiting pasture contamination, help limit
exposure to dangerous levels of infective larvae. It is important to isolate
and treat all new birds to prevent introduction of infection on ostrich
farms.

Predilection site: Feathers and skin
Parasite class: Ischnocera
Family: Philopteridae
Description: Narrow-bodied louse with a large head (Fig. 10.3)
Hosts: Ostrich
Fig. 10.3 Struthiolipeurus struthionis (photograph courtesy of Dr Vince
Smith).
1521
Life cycle: The biology of these lice has not been fully studied, but is
thought to be typical: egg, several nymphal stages and adult requiring
about 1 month for completion.
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: This is a chewing louse, which damages
the feathers, reducing the value of especially white plumes. The damage
causes the feathers to have a moth-eaten appearance.
Treatment and control: Treatment with pyrethroid is recommended;
carbaryl dust (5%) may also be effective.
A variety of other lice may also be found on Ostrich including
Struthiolipeurus nandu and Struthiolipeurus stresemanni.Struthiolipeurus

reported in rheas; and Dahiemhornia asymmetrica in emus.
Gabuciniaspp
Common name: Shaft or quill mites
Predilection site: These mites can be found in the ventral groove of the
feather shaft.
Parasite class: Arachnida
1522
Family: Gabuciniidae
Description: These are pale elongated mites, about 0.5 μm in length. The
dorsal idiosoma appears patterned or sculpted. The first two pairs of legs
protrude anteriorly.
Hosts: Ostrich
Life cycle: Typical: egg, nymphal stages and reproductive adult.
Knowledge of the biology of these quill mites is very limited. Under
intensive conditions this parasite is able to multiply rapidly on ostriches
reaching high densities.
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Quill mites are very common, but
occasionally become a problem in ostriches kept under intensive
conditions. Large numbers of mites cause severe feather damage, causing
scarring of the skin and a reduction in the economic value of the infested
animal.
Diagnosis: Mites may be observed at the base of the feathers.
Treatment and control: Treatment with ivermectin has been reported to
be effective.
Notes: There are several species in this genus, which infest a range of
wild birds,but Gabucinia scuipturata and Gabucinia (Pterolinchus)
bicaudatus are the most common and well described in ostrich.
Numerous species of tick have also been reported to infest ostriches in
their native ranges. These are summarised in the parasite checklist at the
end of this chapter.
REPTILES
Reptiles are represented by four orders of animals comprising
approximately 5500 species. Species of reptiles belonging to the Chelonia

1523
Reptiles in the wild are infected with a wide range of parasites, especially
given the extremely varied range of prey animals, and their potential to act
as intermediate hosts for many species of parasites. Generally though, if
healthy even when carrying burdens of several species of parasites.
Parasites with heteroxenous life cycles, requiring two or more hosts, are
only likely to be encountered in wild-caught animals.
Parasitic infections are frequently encountered in captive-bred reptiles and
this section  will concentrate only on these infections rather than
wild-caught specimens. Given the range of reptile species kept in
captivity, it is beyond the scope of this book to provide detailed
descriptions of all the species of parasites that may be encountered. As
such, only a general overview is provided with more detailed descriptions
of those parasite species considered to be of importance.
It is not uncommon to encounter ^pseudoparasites', which may either be
parasites of the prey host (e.g. the oxyurid parasite, Syphacia of rodents,
seenin snake faeces)or normalcommensals of the gut florain
herbivorous animals (e.g. the ciliate Nyctotherus in iguanas and tortoises).
For this reason it is important to know both the taxonomic identification
and the diet of captive reptiles prior to attempted parasite identification
and instigation of potentially unnecessary treatment.
PARASITES OF THE DIGESTIVE
SYSTEM
HELMINTHS
Whilst cestode, trematode and acanthocephalan parasites are commonly
found in wild-caught reptiles, their complicated life cycles, which may
involve one or more intermediate hosts, mean that they are rarely found in
captive reptiles and as a consequence these parasite classes will not be
discussed further.
1524
Nematodes
Reptile digestive tracts can be infected with a wide range of
trichostrongylid, strongylid, ascarid and other nematode superfamilies.
Both strongyles and tricho-strongyles can be found in the alimentary tracts
Of reptiles, especially snakes.
Kalicephalusspp
Predilection site: Small intestine
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Strongyloidea
Description: Adult worms are 1-5 cm in length
Hosts: Snakes
Life cycle: The life cycle is direct with a prepatent period of 2-4 months.
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Kalicephaius causes a wide range of
signs, including lethargy, regurgitation, diarrhoea, anorexia and debility.
The larvae may undergo a visceral larva migrans and can cause respiratory
problems.
Diagnosis: The embryonated eggs or larvae may be found in faecal
smears or on microscopy of oral and oesophageal mucus, or tracheal
washings.
Pathology: Adult worms embedded in the oesophageal, gastric and
intestinal mucosa cause ulceration, usually with a secondary bacterial
infection. Build-up of necrotic debris may cause occlusion of the
oesophagus.
Epidemiology: Infection is by ingestion of contaminated food or water or
together.
Treatment and control: Treatment is often unsuccessful, although
fenbendazole (50-100 mg/kg) or oxfendazole (60 mg/kg) may be tried.
[vermectin at 200 μg/kg by subcutaneous injection has also been reported
1525
to be effective but should be used with caution in some species of reptiles
controlling and preventing infection.
Within the Ascaridoidea, certain genera and species of these worms
only in snakes; Angusticaecum and Sufcascaris are found in chelonia. The
 pathogenic effects of ascarid nematodes depend on parasite numbers, food
availability and an infected animal's overall condition. Clinical signs, such
as regurgitation and obstipation, may be seen. The presence of the worms
in the gastrointestinal tract may cause gastritis, ulceration and perforation
of the stomach wall; and in the intestines, intestinal obstruction

with heavy worm burdens.
Diagnosis of these infections is based on microscopic examination of eggs
found in the faeces. Ascarid eggs are round with thick, heavily pitted
walls. Control of ascarid nematodes depends on routine parasitological
screening of all new arrivals and treatment of all infected animals with
anthelmintics. Fenbendazole given at 50-100 mg/kg by mouth or stomach
tube is generally reported to be effective.
Oxyurid parasites belonging to the superfamily Oxyuridoidea are
commonly found in reptiles and at least 12 different genera have been
described in snakes, lizards and chelonia. These small nematodes
(pinworms') may be present in large numbers in the large intestine, colon
and rectum, causing discomfort. Some species are viviparous, but the
majority are oviparous or ovovivaporous and a common feature of their
eggs is an asymmetrical flattening on one side. Diagnosis of oxyurid
infections is based on the identification of the characteristic eggs in faeces,
ascarid infections.
Rhabditoidea, are slender, hair-like worms. Only females are parasitic and

another via the larvated egg, which is barrel-shaped with bipolar plugs.
PROTOZOA

commonly seen in the faeces of reptiles. Spironucleus (Hexamita) has
been reported to cause fatal renal disease in aquatic chelonia (terrapins). A

identifying the organisms by their characteristic flagella, nuclear
complement and other morphological characteristics.  Most of these
organisms are sensitive to oral metronidazole (dose rate 100-275 mg/kg)

Several protozoan species may often be present in clinically normal
reptiles and may become pathogenic only if and when the host is stressed
or becomes immunologically incompetent for one reason or another.

Correct identification is essential otherwise they become the objects of
unnecessary (and possibly harmful) treatment. Neonatal common iguanas,
for example, acquire their intestinal microflora by actively seeking out and
ingesting the fresh stools of older lizards. When the normal microflora is
substantially disturbed or destroyed, the gut must be reinoculated with a
culture or other source of bacterial and protozoan organisms from a
healthy animal as close to the genus and species of the sick reptile as
possible.
Entamoebainvadens
Predilection site: Large intestine
1528
Parasite class: Sarcodina
Family: Endamoebidae
Description: Trophozoites are 1 1-20 μm and cysts approximately 16 μm.
Life cycle: Following ingestion of the infective cyst, it excysts and
releases one quadrinucleate trophozoite which divides to produce eight
uninucleate amoebae. These mature in the colon, eventually producing
cysts which pass out in the faeces.
Pathogenesis: E. invadens usually lives as a commensal symbiont in
turtles, some tortoises and crocodilians that serve as healthy reservoirs of
the organism. Contamination of the water supply of snakes and lizards
with Entamoeba can, on occasions, lead to enteritis, hepatitis and,
occasionally, nephritis. It has been reported in cases of human and animal
amoebic meningoencephalitis.
to regurgitation of undigested food, weight loss, dehydration, lethargy,
severe diarrhoea, sometimes accompanied with blood or bile-tinged green
mucus and/or tags of intestinal mucosa. Rupture of hollow viscus organs
has been reported in some cases. Occasionally, rectal or cloacal prolapse
occurs.
Diagnosis: Positive diagnosis of amoebiosis depends upon finding
elongated uninucleate trophozoites and/or cysts containing four nuclei in
the faeces. Cysts are more easily detected if stained with Lugol's iodine.
Pathology: Microscopically, the characteristic lesions produced by E.
invadens are severe intestinal erosion, inflammation and, often, ulceration.
The affected gut wall is thickened, ulcerated and focally necrotic, often a
fibrinonecrotic  pseudomembrane  is  found in  the  intestinal  lumen
overlying the foci of inflammation. Typically, the ileum and colon are the
most severely affected intestinal segments. The liver shows focal areas of
necrosis and evidence of fatty degeneration. Pulmonary abscessation has
also been associated with more chronic infections.

Many of these organisms appear to share a commensal relationship with
their hosts, but some infections have been associated with gastric,
intestinal, hepatic, brain and renal lesions. Due to the potential for human
infection, care must be taken when working with reptiles harbouring these
Organisms.
Several genera of coccidia (Eimeriidae) have been reported from reptiles.
These include Eimeria, Iso-spora, Caryosporai, Cyclospora, Hoarella,
Octosporelia, Pythonelia, Weyonelia, Dorisiella and Tyzzeria. Eimeria,
Isospora and Caryospora are the most frequently observed genera in
reptiles, particularly in lizards and snakes. Isospora has also been reported
in crocodilians. Only Eimeria have been found in chelo-nians. Weyoneffa
has only been reported in snakes. Determining the number of sporocysts
and sporozoites present within the sporulated oocysts is used for
differentiating the genera (see Table l.3).
It is important, however, to be aware that in some species of carnivorous
snakes and lizards, some of the Isospora recorded may be Toxoplasma and
of the prey host.
Parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium are of increasing importance in
lizards and C. saurophilum in lizards.

Description: Oocysts, passed fully sporulated, are ovoid, 5.9 x 5.1 μm,
with a length:width ratio of 1.1 7.
Hosts: Snakes, lizards
Life cycle: The life cycle is unknown but is likely due to the ingestion of
sporulated oocysts, each with four sporozoites. Following ingestion, the
sporozoites appear to invade the microvillous brush border of the gastric
glands to form meronts followed by gametogony and oocyst production.

PARASITES OF THE
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Rhabdias spp
Predilection site: Lungs
Parasite class: Nematoda
Superfamily: Rhabditoidea
Hosts: Snakes
Life cycle: Only females are parasitic and these produce larvated, oval,
stages into free-living adult male and female worms and this can be
followed by a succession of free-living generations. Infection is via the
oral route, but percutaneous infection is also possible.
1534
Pathogenesis and clinical signs: Infection causes minimal damage, but
may result in inflammation and secondary bacterial infection of the oral
mucosa with production of mucous exudate. Percutaneous infections may
cause skin lesions.
Diagnosis: The larvae may be found in faecal smears or on microscopy of
tracheal washings.
Treatment and control: Levamisole given at 10 mg/kg into the coelomic
cavity and repeated after 2 weeks is effective. Ivermectin at 200 μg/kg by
subcutaneous injection has also been reported to be effective.

Diagnosis: Sporocysts may be detected in urine sediments or trophozoite
stages may be found on postmortem in the kidney. The site and location
are pathognomonic.
Epidemiology: Sporocysts are passed in the urine and infection takes
place by the ingestion of the sporulated sporocysts.
Treatment and control: Not required, although some of the
sulphonamide  antibiotics,  such

PROSTIGMATA
Trombiculid mites (family Trombiculidae) during their larval stages only,
feed on reptiles for 2-10 days before dropping off, moulting to
protonymphs and then deutonymphs, which feed on insects and spiders.
The adult mites feed on detritus in the environment.
The family Pterygosamatidae are specialised parasitic mites of lizards,
parasitising only certain species of lizards that include the agamids
(Agamidae), geckoes (Gekonidae), iguanas (lguanidae) and zonures
(Zonuridae). Geckobiella and Pimeliaphilus infest primarily geckoes;
Hirstiella infests iguanas and geckoes; Ixodiderma infests zonures;
Scapothrix and Zonurobia infest zonures, with some infections causing
severe dermatitis.
TICKS
Amblyomma,Aponomma,Hyaiomma,Haemaphysalis,Ixodes,Argas and
Ornithodoros. These tick genera are covered in more detail in Chapter 11
imported from southern Europe for the pet trade. This practice has now
ceased and there is no evidence of establishment outside its natural range.
The relapsing fever tick, Ornithodoros turicata, native to the USA and
Mexico, has been reported on box turtles (Terrepene spp)
More detailed descriptions of these ticks are given in Chapter 11
(Facultative ectoparasites and arthropod vectors).
INSECTS
Several fly species are known to attack reptilian hosts and may be
responsible for transmission of diseases in  the wild. Phlebotomine
sandflies are known to transmit Leishmania to reptiles, and mosquitoes
1539
transmit a range of haemoparasites, filarial worms and arboviruses to
reptiles.
Myiasis has been reported in tortoises with blowfly larvae causing lesions
especially around the cloaca, following diarrhoea or trauma to the cloaca.
Treatment is by cleaning and debriding the lesion, followed by
disinfection and application of a topical insecticide.

TICKS
SOFT TICKS (ARGASIDAE)
[n the soft ticks (Argasidae), the body is leathery and unsclerotised, with a
        r 
marked with grooves or folds. Argasids typically have a multi-host
developmental cycle. The single larval instar feeds once, before moulting
to become a first-stage nymph. There are between two and seven nymphal
stages, each of which feed and then leave the host, before moulting to the
next stage. Adults mate away from the host and feed several times. The
adult female lays batches of 400-500 eggs after each feed. In contrast to
the slow-feeding ixodids, argasid ticks feed for only a few minutes.
Argasid, soft ticks are more common in deserts or dry conditions. In
contrast to the hard ticks, argasid soft ticks tend to live in close proximity
to their hosts: in chicken coops, pigsties, pigeon lofts, bird’s nests, animal
burrows or dens. In these restricted and sheltered habitats the hazards
associated with host finding are reduced and more frequent feeding
becomes possible.
Clinical signs: The adult ticks, particularly the engorged females, are
easily seen on the skin, commonly beneath the wings. Egg laying
decreases and may stop altogether as a result of the infestation. However,
1544
the ticks only feed for a limited period. Inflammation and raised areas will
be present from tick bites.
Diagnosis: The parasites may be found on the host or found in cracks of
the woodwork and walls around the animal housing. Microscopic
Pathology: Small granulomatous reactions may form at the site of tick
bites, consisting of a mixed inflammatory cell response with fibrosis.
Treatment: Argasid ticks, which exist in and around animal housing,
poultry houses and enclosures, can be controlled by application of an
the host. Environmental treatment of roosts and poultry houses may be
effected using acaricidal sprays or emulsions containing organophosphates
and pyrethroids. All niches and crevices in affected buildings should be
sprayed, and nesting boxes and perches in poultry houses should also be
painted with acaricides. At the same time as premises are treated, birds
should be dusted with a suitable acaricide or, in the case of larger animals,
sprayed or dipped. Treatment should be repeated at monthly intervals.
Control: In poultry houses, all new birds should be treated prior to
introduction into an existing flock. Control of argasid ticks can be assisted
by elimination of cracks in walls and perches, which provide shelter to the
free-living stages.
ARGAS
Species of the genus Argas are usually dorsoventrally flattened, with
definite margins, which can be seen even when the tick is engorged. The
cuticle is wrinkled and leathery. Most species are nocturnal and are
parasites of birds, bats, reptiles or, occasionally, small insectivorous
mammals. Most species seldom attack humans. Species of this genus are
usually found in dry, arid habitats. Detailed description of only the major
species of veterinary importance will be presented here.

Hosts: Chicken, turkey and wild birds
Life cycle: Argas persicus is nocturnal and breeds and shelters in cracks
and crevices in the structure of poultry houses. Females deposit batches of
25-100 eggs in these cracks and crevices. Up to 700 eggs may be
produced by a single female at intervals, each oviposition preceded by a
blood-meal. After hatching, larvae locate a host and remain attached and
feed for several days. After feeding they detach, leave the host and shelter

first-stage nymphs. They then proceed through two or three nymphal
stages, interspersed with frequent nightly feeds, before moulting to the
adult stage. Adult males and females feed about once a month, but can
survive for long periods without a blood-meal. Females can become
completely engorged within 30-45 minutes. Under favourable conditions
the life cycle can be completed in about 30 days. All stages of these ticks
remain around the roosting area of poultry, quiescent in the day and
actively feeding at night. Argas persicus can survive in empty poultry
housing for years, and may travel long distances to find their hosts. This
round.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, especially in the tropics
Pathogenesis: Though common pests of chickens and turkeys, they are
not usually a significant veterinary problem, except in small, housed
flocks. It will bite humans, particularly if living in proximity to an infested
flock. Infestation may cause irritation, sleeplessness, loss of egg
considerable quantity of blood for engorgement, and therefore heavy
infestations can take enough blood to bring about the death of their host.
Most species are nocturnal and are parasites of birds, bats, reptiles or,
These ticks may transmit Borrelia anserina, the cause of fowl
spirochaetosis, and Aegyptianella puflorum, a rickettsial infection. It is a
vector of Borrelia anserina and Aegyptianella pullorum among poultry, as
1547
well as avian spirochaetosis. The spirochaetes may be passed from one
generation of ticks to the next through the egg, and transmitted to the host
by biting or by faecal contamination.
Argas reflexus
Common name: Pigeon tick
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: [xodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Argasidae
Description: The adult Argas reflexus is between 6 and 1l mm in length
and may be distinguished from the fowl tick, Argas persicus, by its body
margin, which is composed of irregular grooves, and the hypostome,
which is not notched apically (Fig. 1l.1). It is reddish brown in colour
with paler legs.
Distribution: It is abundant in the Middle and Near East, from where it
has spread into Europe and most of Asia.
Hosts: Pigeon
Life cycle: The life cycle is similar to that of A. persicus. The number of

complete. It is nocturnal and during the day lives in crevices in the pigeon
house or nest material. It can withstand prolonged periods of starvation.
Engorged females diapause during the summer months.
If oviposition has already commenced, egg-laying stops and resumes the
following year without the need for another blood meal.
Pathogenesis: Heavy infestations may cause death from anaemia. It may
also transmit fowl spirochaetosis. This tick occasionally bites humans,
causing allergy. Its northern distribution through Europe is limited by the
1548

since A. reflexus eggs show low levels of cold tolerance. Typical winter
temperatures of 3°C cause approximately 50% mortality in A. reffexus
eggs.
Epidemiology: This species lives in close association with its host,
Columba livia.
Argas walkerae
Common name: Chicken tick
Predilection site: Skin, commonly beneath the wings
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes

ORNITHODOROS
This genus includes about 90 species, almost all of which are found in
tropical and subtropical habitats in both the Old and New World. Most
Ornithodoros species are found in Africa, commonly in the burrows of
South America and the Rocky Mountain states of the USA. They are
nocturnal and the mouthparts are well developed. The integument has a
wrinkled pattern, which runs continuously over the dorsal and ventral
surfaces (Fig. 11.2). There is no distinct lateral margin to the body, which
appears sac- like. Species of this genus are found largely in habitats such
as dens, caves, nests and burrows, and so are not normally a problem for
most domestic animals. Only the nymphs and adults are parasitic and may
be responsible for considerable irritation; heavy infections can cause
mortality of stock from blood loss.

Several species of Ornithodoros inflict painful bites and may be major
vectors of relapsing fever. Detailed description of only the major species

OTOBIUS
This small genus contains only two species: Otobius megnini and Otobius
lagophilus.
Otobius megnini
Common name: Spinose ear tick
Predilection site: Ears
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Argasidae
Description: The adult body is rounded posteriorly and slightly attenuated
anteriorly (Fig. 11.3). Adult females range in size from 5-8 mm in length;
males are slightly smaller. They have no lateral sutural line, and no
distinct margin to the body. Nymphs have spines. In adults the hypostome
1557
is much reduced and the integument is granular. The body has a blue-grey
coloration with pale yellow legs and mouthparts. Larvae measure 2-3 mm
in length and a fully-grown, engorged nymph measures 7-10 mm.
Hosts: Commonly infests wild and domestic animals, including sheep,
cattle, dogs, horses and occasionally humans.
Life cycle: This species is a one-host tick. The larval and nymphal stages
are parasites of a wide range of mammals, but the adults are not parasitic.
Mating takes place off the host, and batches of eggs are laid in sheltered
sites such as in cracks and crevices in the walls of animal shelters, under
stones or the bark of trees. The larvae hatch within 3-8 weeks and attach
to a host animal. They may survive without food for 2-4 months. The
moult in the ears and nymphs remain there for 1-7 months. When fully
grown and engorged, the nymphs drop off the host and seek dry, sheltered
sites, where they moult after a few days to become adults. The adults do

Secondary bacterial infections can occur, which may extend up the ear
canal. Infested hosts may scratch and shake their heads. Scratching can
cause local skin trauma and occasionally perforate the eardrum. This can
clinical signs may be mistaken for signs of colic.
Otobius lagophilus
Common name: Rabbit ear tick
Predilection site: Ears
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: [xodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Argasidae
Hosts: Rabbits
Life cycle: This species is a one-host tick. Only larvae and nymphs are
parasitic.
Geographical distribution: North America, Canada
Pathogenesis: The larvae and nymphs feed in the external ear canal of the
host, producing severe inflammation and a waxy exudate in the ear canals.
Infested hosts may scratch and shake their heads. Scratching can cause
local skin trauma.
1559
HARDTICKS
Life cycle: The life cycles of ixodid ticks involve four instars: egg,
six-legged larva, eight-legged nymph and eight-legged adult. During the
passage through these stages ixodid ticks take a number of large blood
meals, interspersed by lengthy free-living periods. They are relatively
long-lived and each female may produce several thousand eggs.
Most hard ticks are relatively immobile and, rather than actively hunting
for their hosts, the majority adopt a strategy known as questing, in which
they wait at the tips of vegetation for an appropriate host to brush past.
Once contact is made the ticks transfer to the host, and then move over the
tick.
Ticks have developed a variety of complex life cycles and feeding
strategies, which reflect the nature of the habitat, which the various
species of tick inhabit, and the probability of contact with an appropriate
host. For most a three-host life cycle has been adopted (Fig. 1.41). Larvae,
nymphs and adults all feed on different hosts. Blood-feeding typically
takes between 4 and 6 days after which they drop to the ground and either
suitable host to feed and moult again or lay eggs. For a relatively small
are scarce and in which lengthy seasonal periods of unfavourable climate
occur, two- and one- host feeding strategies have evolved.
In temperate habitats, feeding and generation cycles of hard ticks are
closely synchronised with periods of suitable temperature and humidity
conditions. Ticks, particularly in the immature stages, are very susceptible
to desiccation, particularly when ticks are active. To minimise drying out
they start questing when saturated with water and return to the humid
ground level when dehydrated. Water may also be imbibed by drinking.
Clinical signs: There are no obvious signs of tick infestation other than
the presence of the parasites and the local skin reactions to their bites.
Diagnosis: The adult ticks, particularly the engorged females, are easily
seen on the skin, the predilection sites being the face, ears, axilla and
inguinal region. Usually small, inflamed nodules are also seen in these
1560
environment and microscopic examination used to identify individual
species.
Pathology: The local reaction to tick bites varies considerably; commonly
small granulomatous reactions may form at the site of tick bites consisting
of a mixed inflammatory cell response with fibrosis.
Epidemiology: The distribution of ticks in a temperate climate with
frequent and non-seasonal rainfall is closely linked with the availability of
a microenvironment with a high relative humidity, such as occurs in the
mat which forms under the surface of rough grazing. In contrast, in
tropical grazing areas the grass cover on pastures is discontinuous and
often interspersed with bare or eroded patches. Where suitable grass cover
does exist it has been generally accepted, since temperatures are suitable
for development throughout a large part of the year, that the distribution of
ticks is mainly governed by rainfall, and with the exception of Hyalomma
However, recent studies have shown that the factors underlying the
are rather more complex, and depend on the transpiration of plant leaves.
As long as this continues, adequate humidity is maintained in the
microclimate despite the dryness of the general environment. However,
on the leaves close, transpiration ceases and the low humidity created in
the microclimate rapidly becomes lethal to the ticks.
In the field, the stability of the microclimate is dependent on factors such
as the quantity of herbage or plant debris and the grass species. The
 n        
humidity within which they are active and feed, and these thresholds
govern their distribution. Generally, ticks are most active during the warm
season provided there is sufficient rainfall, but in some species the larval
and nymphal stages are also active in milder weather. This affects the
duration and timing of control programmes.
Treatment: The control of ixodid ticks is largely based on the use of
chemical acaricides applied either by total immersion in a dipping bath or
in the form of a spray, shower, spot-on or slow-release ear tags. A wide
variety of formulations of organophosphate (e.g. malathion, chlorpyrifos,
1561
fenthion, dichlorvos, cythoate, diazinon, propetamphos, phosmet) and
pyrethroid insecticides (e.g- permethrin, deltamethrin) are available for
application as sprays, dips, spot-on or showers. Macrocyclic lactones or
closantel given by the parenteral route have also been shown to be a useful
aid in control of ticks. Where severely parasitised animals require
individual treatment, special formulations of acaricides suspended in a
greasy base may be applied to affected areas.
[n companion animals, topical acaricidal compounds, such as fipronil
(phenylpyrazole), imidacloprid (chloronicotinyl), selamectin (macrocyclic
lactone), amitraz (formamidine) and the organophosphates (e.g-
malathion, ronnel, chlorpyrifos, fenthion, dichlorvos, cythoate, diazinon,
propetamphos, phosmet) and carbamates can be used to kill ticks on the
host. Pyrethroids (e.g- permethrin, deltamethrin) should not be used in
cats.
Control: The long-term control of three-host ticks is geared to the period
required for the adult female stage to become fully engorged, which varies
from 4-l0 days according to the species. [f an animal is treated with an
acaricide which has a residual effect of, say, 3 days, it will be at least 7
days before any fully engorged female reappears following treatment (i.e.
3 days’ residual effect plus a minimum of 4 days for engorgement).
Weekly treatment during the tick season should therefore kill the adult
challenge when the treatment interval has to be reduced to 4 or 5 days.
Theoretically, weekly treatment should also control the larvae and
nymphs, but in several areas the peak infestations of larvae and nymphs
occur at different seasons to the adult females and the duration of the
treatment season has to be extended
Since many ticks occur on less accessible parts of the body, such as the
anus, vulva, groin, scrotum, udder and ear, care must be exercised to
ensure that the acaricide is properly applied.
Traditional control methods such as burning of cattle pastures are still
g pod p e  psd  ae  se s ue pa
rains, when ticks are inactive. This technique is still a most useful one in
extensive range conditions, and provided it is used after seeding of the
grasses has taken place, regeneration of the pastures will rapidly occur
following the onset of rains. Cultivation of land and, in some areas,
1562
can be used where more intensive systems of agriculture prevail. Pasture
'spelling’ in which domestic livestock are removed from pastures for a
often has the disadvantage that ticks can still obtain blood from a wide
variety of other hosts.

IXODES
Ixodes is the largest genus in the family Ixodidae, with about 250 species.
They are small, inornate ticks, which do not have eyes or festoons. The
mouthparts are long and are longer in the female than male. The fourth
1563
segment of the palps is greatly reduced and bears chemoreceptor sensilla.
        sd   s s 
gap between the palp and chelicerae (Fig. 11.4). Males have several
ventral plates, which almost cover the ventral surface. Ixodes can be
distinguished from other ixodid ticks by the anterior position of the anal
groove. In other genera of the Ixodidae the anal groove is either absent or
is posterior to the anus (see Fig. 11.8a)
Ixodesricinus
Common name: Sheep tick; castor bean tick
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: [xodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: The engorged adult female is light grey, up to 1.0 cm in
length and bean shaped (Figs 11.5, 11.6). However, when engorged the
legs are not visible when viewed from above. Adult male Ixodes ricinus
are only 2.0-3.0 mm long, and because they take smaller blood meals than
females, the four pairs of legs are readily visible from above. Nymphs
resemble the adults but are less than 2.0 mm in length. The larvae, often
described as 'seed ticks’ or 'pepper ticks', are less than 1.0 mm in length
and usually yellowish in colour.
In I. ricinus, as compared with I. canisuga and I. hexagonus, the tarsi are
tapered (Fig. 11.7) and not humped and the posterior internal angle of the
first coxa bears a spur, which overlaps the second coxa (Fig. 11.8)
Hosts: Sheep, cattle, goat, but can feed on all mammals and birds;
juvenile stages may also feed on lizards.
Life cycle: I. ricinus is a three-host tick and the life cycle requires 3 years.
The tick feeds for only a few days each year, as a larva in the first year, a
nymph in the second and an adult in the third.
1564
Mating takes place on the host. After attachment the female is inseminated
once and subsequently completes a single large blood meal; in contrast,
the males feed intermittently and mate repeatedly. During mating, the
 e        s 
opening with its mouth-parts, transfers the spermatophore, a sac
containing the spermatozoa, into the opening, with the aid of his front
legs. Once fertilised, the female subsequently feeds for about 14 days and
then drops to the ground to lay several thousand eggs in the soil in
sheltered spots, over a period of about 30 days, after which it dies.

The eggs hatch to produce larvae. Larvae begin to quest several days to
several weeks after hatching, the precise time depending on temperature
and humidity. The larvae climb up the stems of vegetation ready to attach
to a passing host. Once a host is located, larvae feed for 3-5 days,
a m uo y dop u 's ool Aq iam Aoq  ss
 s m  yas   s    a s
feeding for 3-5 days, before dropping off the host and moulting into the
adultstage.
The host on which nymphs feed is usually larger than that of the larvae,
typically a bird, rabbit or squirrel. Twelve months later adults begin to
quest for a host, on which they feed and mate. Adults feed on larger
mammals, such as sheep, cattle or deer and achieve this selection by
climbing to different levels in the vegetation while questing.
Although the life cycle takes 3 years to complete, the larvae, nymphs and
adults feed for a total of only 26-28 days and I. ricinus is therefore a
   
months, unfed nymphs for 24 months and unfed adults for 21-31 months.
but the precise period over which they can survive depends on
temperature and humidity.
Geographical distribution: Temperate areas of Europe, Australia, South
Africa, Tunisia, Algeria and Asia. It is more common in areas of rough
grazing moorland and woodland.

Although recorded, this species has never become established in North
America.
Pathogenesis: Ixodes ticks ingest blood and, occasionally, heavy
infestations can cause anaemia. Tick bites may damage the host at the site
1567
of attachment caus ing local injury, which may predispose to secondary
bacterial infection. The lesions caused during feding may predispose to
myiasis. Also at slaughter the value of the hide or fleece may be reduced.
Most significant of all, this tick transmits a range of pathogens. In western
Europe, in cattle it transmits Babesia divergens and B. bovis, the causes of
red-water fever and Anaplasma marginaie, the cause of anaplasmosis in
cattle. [n sheep and cattle, it transmits the virus that causes louping-ill and
the rickettsia responsible for tick-borne fever. It is also associated with
tick pyaemia, caused by Staphylococcus aureus, in lambs in Britain and
Norway.
Ixodid ticks also transmit Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochaete
responsible for Lyme disease in humans. Ixodes ricinus has been reported
to cause tick paralysis and act as a vector for Czechoslovakian
encephalitis, Russian spring-summer encephalitis and Coxiella burnetii.
This tick may also transmit Bukhovinian haemorrhagic fever.
Ixodescanisuga
Common name: Dog tick
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: Ixodes canisuga is an inornate tick, without festoons or eyes.
The palps are long and the ventral surface of the male is almost entirely
covered with a series of plates. An anal groove is present anterior to the
anus. The engorged female is light grey, up to 10 mm in length and
bean-shaped, with four pairs of legs. The males are only 2.0-3.0 mm long,
and the four pairs of legs are readily visible. I. canisuga can be
differentiated from I. ricinus by the presence of humped tarsi (Fig. 11.7)
(Fig. 1l.8). Nymphs resemble the adults and also have four pairs of legs,
1568
but are less than 2.0 mm in size. The larvae ('pepper ticks') are less than
1.0 mm, usually yellowish in colour and have only three pairs of legs.
Hosts: Mammals including dogs, foxes, sheep, horses and mules
approximately 3 years to complete. The tick feeds for only a few days
each year; as a larva in the first year, a nymph in the second and an adult
in the third. The life cycle is adapted to life in a lair or den. Mating takes
place in the den and adult males are only rarely found on the host. Adult
females lay relatively small numbers of eggs, probably about 400.
Geographical distribution: Throughout Europe, as far east as Russia
Pathogenesis: Infestation may cause dermatitis, pruritus, alopecia and
anaemia, but it is not an important vector of disease. It may be a particular
problem in packs of dogs in kennels.
Epidemiology: This species, sometimes called the British dog tick, has
been found in a variety of hosts. It is particularly recognised as a problem
in kennels, where the tick is capable of survival in crevices and cracks in
the floors and walls.
Ixodes hexagonus
Common name: Hedgehog tick
Predilection site: Head, ears
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: Adults are red-brown, with legs that appear somewhat
banded in colour. The scutum is broadly hexagonal (hence the name
  l o d n a o xoo a   l  (s
spur. However, the spur is smaller than in I. ricinus and does not overlap

tarsi are long (0.8 mm in the female and 0.5 mm in the male) and sharply
humped apically (Fig. 11.7).
Hosts: Hedgehog; other mammals, including dogs, cats, foxes, sheep,
horse, moles
Life cycle: Ixodes hexagonus is a three-host tick adapted to live with hosts
which use burrows or nests. It is primarily a parasite of hedgehogs but
may also be found on dogs and other small mammals. The life cycle is
similar to that of I. ricinus: egg, hexapod larva, octopod nymph and adult,
periods of about 8 days. After dropping to the ground adult females
The ticks may be active from early spring to late autumn, but are probably
most active during April and May. This species inhabits sheltered habitats
such as burrows and kennels and may infest pets in large numbers when
they are exposed.
Geographical distribution: Europe and northwest Africa
Pathogenesis: On dogs and cats, adult females usually attach themselves
behind the ears, on the jaws, neck and groin, causing localised dermatitis
and the risk of wound infection. These ticks are often found to be
around the head area. It may also become a more significant pest in places
where I. ricinus is absent. Ixodes hexagonus is a biological vector of
Borrelia spp and tick-borne encephalitis.
Epidemiology: The main host is the European hedgehog, and the
movement of this host to urbanised areas may increase the risk of both
 people and their animals being exposed to infectious diseases carried by I.
hexagonus.
Ixodes holocyclus
Common name: Paralysis tick
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
1570
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: The engorged adult female is light grey, up to 1.0 cm in
length, bean shaped and has four pairs of legs. The males are only 2.0-3.0
mm long, and the four pairs of legs are readily visible. The palps are long
and the ventral surface of the adult male is almost entirely covered with a
series of plates. An anal groove is present anterior to the anus. Nymphs
resemble the adults but are less than 2.0 mm in size while the larvae are
less than 1.0 mm in length, and usually are yellowish in colour.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, dog, cat. All mammals and birds
Life cycle: This species is a three-host tick. The tick feeds for only a few
days each year, as a larva in the first year, a nymph in the second and an
adult in the third. Mating takes place on the host. After attachment the
female is inseminated once and subsequently completes her single large
blood meal; in contrast, the males feed intermittently and mate repeatedly.
Once fertilised, the female subsequently feeds for about 14 days and then
drops to the ground to lay several thousand eggs in sheltered spots, after
which she dies. The larvae, which hatch from the eggs, will feed for about
6 days in the following year, then drop to the ground and moult to the
s u o sop 'sp sis sn r p an ul is pr
adult. Although the life cycle takes 3 years to complete, the larvae,
nymphs and adults feed for a total of only 26-28 days.
Geographical distribution: A ustralia
Pathogenesis: Ixodes holocycius is the main cause of tick paralysis in
Australia. Its paralysing toxin has been reported to affect at least 20 000
domestic animals annually. Although infestations usually consist of
relatively few individual ticks, I. hofocycius infestations can kill cattle.
particularly calves, and small domestic animals. Fifty larvae or five
nymphs will kill a 40 g rat, and larger numbers of either can cause
paralysis in dogs and cats.
1571
Generally only the adult stage infests cattle, with the worst outbreaks in
late winter, spring and summer. Ixodes holocyclus is also a vector for
Coxielia burnetii (Q fever) and Rickettsia australis (Queensland tick
typhus).
Epidemiology: This species is most commonly found amongst low, leafy
vegetation since this protects it against sun and wind exposure and
 maintains the high humidity required for development.
Ixodes persulcatus
Common name: Taiga tick
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: The taiga tick, Ixodes persulcatus, is morphologically very
similar to I. ricinus; it is an inornate, red-brown coloured tick, without
festoons or eyes. The palps are long and the ventral surface of the male is
is light grey and up to 10 mm in length. The major difference is that the
female adult I. persulcatus has a straight or wavy genital opening rather
than arched as in I. ricinus.
Hosts: Sheep, cattle, goat, horse, dog, other mammals, birds and man
Life cycle: The taiga tick has a similar life cycle to Ixodes ricinus
although adults are rarely active during autumn.
ricinus, being widespread throughout eastern Europe, Russia and as far
east as Japan.
Pathogenesis: Ixodes persufcatus is a major vector of the human diseases
Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus and Lyme borreliosis.
1572
Epidemiology: Taiga ticks may be dispersed by migrating birds
Ixodesrubicundus
Common name: Karoo paralysis tick
Predilection site: Skin, neck, chest and belly
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Hosts: Domestic livestock and wild ungulates
Life cycle: This is a three-host tick species. The tick feeds for only a few
days as a larva, a nymph and an adult. The life cycle of this species takes
about 2 years. Mating takes place on the host. After attachment the female
is inseminated once and subsequently completes her single large blood
meal; in contrast, the males feed intermittently and mate repeatedly. Once
fertilised, the female subsequently feeds for about 14 days and then drops
to the ground to lay several thousand eggs in sheltered spots, after which
she dies.
Geographical distribution: Southern Africa, particularly the Karrooveld
Pathogenesis: Ixodes rubicundus, the Karoo paralysis tick, parasitises
domestic stock and wild ungulates in South Africa and may lead to serious
losses. Ticks may cause damage at the site of attachment causing local
injury, which may predispose to secondary bacterial infection. The adult
tick produces a toxin that causes paralysis in sheep and goats. Affected
animals become paralysed and some may show signs of incoordination
and stumbling. Unless ticks are removed, the animal will remain paralysed
and die within days. Most affected animals recover within 24 to 48 hours
once the ticks have been removed or animals have been dipped.
1573
Ixodes scapularis
Synonym: Ixodes dammini
Common name: Shoulder tick, black-legged tick
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Hosts: Deer. All mammals and birds
Life cycle: This is a three-host tick species. It feeds for only a few days
each year, as a larva in the first year, a nymph in the second and an adult
in the third. Mating usually takes place on the host. After attachment the
female is inseminated and subsequently completes her single large blood
meal. In contrast, the adult males feed intermittently and mate repeatedly.
Once fertilised, the female subsequently feeds for about 14 days and then
which she dies. The following year, peak larval activity occurs in August,
when larvae attach and feed on a wide variety of mammals and birds,
particularly on white-footed mice (Peromyscus feucopus). After feeding
for 3-5 days, engorged larvae drop from the host to the ground where they
Overwinter before moulting to become a nymph. In May of the following
year, larvae moult to become nymphs, which feed on a variety of hosts for
3-4 days. Engorged nymphs then detach and drop to the forest floor where
they moult into the adult stage, which becomes active in October. Adult
ticks remain active through the winter on days when the ground and
ambient temperatures are above freezing. The adult ticks feed on large
mammals, primarily upon whitetailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus.
Although the life cycle takes 3 years to complete, the larvae, nymphs and
adults feed for a total of only 26-28 days.
Geographical distribution: North America, particularly in and around
wooded areas
1574
Pathogenesis: Ixodes scapularis inflicts a very painful bite. Nymphal and
adult stages of this tick are the most common vector for Lyme disease in
North America. They are also implicated in the transmission of
Franciselfa tularensis. These ticks are major vectors for the transmission
of human babesiosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) and are
responsible for the transmission of anaplasmosis and piroplasmosis.
Epidemiology: Ixodes scapularis requires a relative high humidity to
survive, and its patterns of feeding activity reflect this requirement. With
feeding restricted to times of year when conditions of temperature and
humidity are appropriate, distinct restricted seasonal periods of activity
result, usually in spring and autumn. As a result of its requirement for high
humidity, in general, it is associated with areas of deciduous woodland
containing small mammals and deer.
Ixodes pacificus
Common name: Western black-legged tick
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: [xodidia (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: A very similar species to Ixodes scapularis. Adult ticks are
red-brown in colour and about 3 mm in size. Larvae and nymphs are
smaller and paler in colour.
Life cycle: This is a three-host tick species
Geographical distribution: Commonly found in the Western USA and
British Columbia
Pathogenesis: It is known to be a vector of Lyme disease and the
rickettsia responsible for equine granulocytic ehrliciosis.
1575
Epidemiology: It is found in habitats with forest, north coastal scrub, high
brush and open grasslands

in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa. However, one important
species is found in temperate North America. The identification of more
readers will need to consult a relevant taxonomic specialist.
Amblyomma americanum
Common name: Lone star tick
Predilection site: Ears, flanks, head and belly
Parasite class:Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description, adults: The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, is so
called because of a single white spot on the scutum of the female (Fig.
11.9). These are large, usually ornate, ticks whose legs have bands of
colour. Eyes and festoons are present. The palps and hypostome are long.
and ventral plates are absent in the males. The engorged female is up to 10
   l eo  g      
reddish-brown in colour, becoming light grey when engorged. On the
scutum are two deep parallel cervical grooves and a large, pale spot at its
posterior margin. The male is small with two pale symmetrical spots near
the hind margin of the body, a pale stripe at each side, and a short oblique
pale stripe behind each eye. The males are only 2-3 mm in length, and
because of the small idiosoma the four pairs of legs are readily visible. [n

both sexes, coxa I has a long external spur and a short internal spur, and
the mouthparts are much longer than the basis capituli.
Nymphs and larvae: Nymphs resemble the adults and also have four
pairs of legs but are less than 2 mm in size, while the larvae ('pepper
ticks') are less than 1 mm in length, usually yellowish in colour and have
only three pairs of legs.
Hosts: Wild and domestic animals, particularly cattle; birds; larvae are
most frequently found on wild small mammals.

Life cycle: The life cycle is typical of a three-host tick. Adult females
attach to a host and take a single large blood-meal over a period of 3-4
weeks, taking 0.5-2.0 ml of blood, during the course of which they mate
once. In contrast, the males feed intermittently and mate repeatedly. Once
fertilised, the female drops to the ground to lay several thousand eggs in
sheltered spots, after which she dies. The larvae, which hatch from the

1578
drops off and becomes adult. Although the life cycle takes 3 years to
complete, the larvae, nymphs and adults feed for a total of only 26-28
days. Larvae and nymphs feed on rodents, rabbits and ground-inhabiting
birds. Adults feed on larger mammals such as deer, cattle, horses and
sheep.
Geographical distribution: Widely distributed throughout central and
eastern USA
Pathogenesis: This tick is most commonly found on the ears, flanks, head
and belly. Tick infestation is irritating and painful, and infestation has
ml of host blood, so large numbers can cause anaemia. Bites may cause
tick paralysis. Amblyomma americanum is an important vector of
tuiarensis (tularaemia). It has also been implicated as a vector of Borrelia
burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Q fever, canine ehrlichiosis and human
monocytic ehrlichiosis.
Epidemiology: Feeding larvae, nymphs and adults are active between
  s s   s  n s 
feeding activity of each stage. There is usually a single generation per
year. This species is particularly common in wooded areas, where hosts
become infected as they brush against vegetation harbouring ticks.

been associated with tick paralysis. The wounds created by this species
may create a suitable site for screwworm myiasis associated with
Cochliomyia spp.
BOOPHILUS
Ticks of the genus Boophilus are often known as “blue ticks', and are
important as vectors of Babesia spp and Anaplasma marginale in cattle in
subtropical and tropical countries. The palps and hypostome are short. The
males have adanal or accessory ventral shields. The basis capituli is
hexagonal dorsally. The mouthparts are short and the compressed palps
are ridged dorsally and laterally (Fig. 1 1.4). Unfed adults may be only 2 or
3 mm long, reaching lengths of up to 12 mm when engorged. The
text and interested readers will need to consult a relevant taxonomic
specialist.
Control: The basis of successful control is to prevent the development of
the engorged female ticks and so limit the deposition of large numbers of

therefore, treatment every 21 days during the tick season should give good
control, but since the nymphal stages appear to be less susceptible to most
acaricides, a 12-day interval is often necessary between treatments at the
beginning of the tick season. The avermectins/milbemycins may play an
increasing role in the control of one-host ticks. A single acaricide
treatment can destroy all of the ticks on an animal, but will not prevent
reinfestation. Hence, to effect long-term control, cattle that have had direct
Or presumed contact with Boophilus must be dipped at regular intervals
for at least a year and the movement of animals into the affected farms or
ranches strictly controlled.

stage. Mating takes place on the host. The total period spent on the host is
between 15 and 55 days, although unfed larvae can survive for up to 8
months before attachment to the host. Two to four generations may occur
per year, depending on climatic conditions; the entire life cycle of this
species can be completed in 6 weeks.

Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: Adult B. micropius have a short, straight gnathosoma. The
legs are pale cream. The body is oval to rectangular and the scutum is oval
and wider at the front. The anal groove is obsolete in the female and is
faint in the male and surrounds the anus posteriorly. Coxa I is bifid. The
spiracles are circular or oval. The nymphs of this species have an

colour is brown to blue-grey, with white at the front and sides.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, wild ungulates
Life cycle: This species is a one-host tick. The larva, nymph and adult all
attach to, and develop on, a single host. The engorged female drops off the
host and lays between 2000 and 4500 eggs 0ver a period of 4-44 days.
The larvae hatch after 14-146 days depending on climatic conditions. The
1585
larvae then attach to the host, feed and moult to the nymph and then adult
stages. From the attachment of larva to engorgement of the adult female
requires 3 weeks. After engorging, females can weigh up to 250 times
more than when unfed. Mating takes place on the host. The total period
spent on the host is between 17 and 52 days, and the entire life cycle can
be completed within 2 months, although unfed larvae can survive for up to
20 weeks before attachment to the host. Although present all year round,
 populations reach their peak in summer.
Geographical distribution: Asia, Australia, Mexico, Central and South
America, West Indies, South Africa
Pathogenesis: B. micropius is widely distributed in the southern
hemisphere and the southern states of the USA and is considered one of
the most serious external parasites of Australian cattle. This tick species is
an important vector for the transmission of Babesia bigemina and Borrelia
theileri in South America, Anaplasma marginale in Australia and South
America and Coxieffa burnetii in Australia.Disease transmission can
occur throughout all the parasite stages. Disease organisms may be passed

DERMACENTOR
Ticks of the genus Dermacentor are medium-sized to large ticks, usually
with ornate patterning. The palps and mouthparts are short and the basis
capituli is rectangular (Fig. 11.4). Festoons and eyes are present. The coxa
of the first pair of legs is divided into two sections in both sexes. Coxae
progressively increase in size from I to IV. The males lack ventral plates
and, in the adult male, the coxa of the fourth pair of legs is greatly
beyond the scope of this text and interested readers will need to consult a
relevant taxonomic specialist.
Most species of Dermacentor are three-host ticks, but a few are one-host
ticks. The genus is small with about 30 species, most of which are found
in the New World. Several of the species are directly associated with
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q fever, tularaemia and Colorado tick
fever. The salivary secretions of some species may produce tick paralysis.

Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description, adults: Dermacentor andersoni is an ornate tick, with a base
colour of brown and a grey pattern (Fig. 11.11). Males are about 2-6 mm
1588
in length and females about 3-5 mm in length when unfed and 10-11 mm
in length when engorged. The mouthparts are short. The basis capituli is
short and broad. The legs are patterned in the same manner as the body.
The coxae of the first pair of legs have well developed external and
internal spurs.
Hosts: Immature stages: small rodents; adults: wild and domestic
herbivores
Life cycle: Dermacentor andersoni is a three-host tick.Immature stages
primarily feed on small rodents, while adults feed largely on wild and

Geographical distribution: Widely distributed throughout the western
and central parts of North America from Mexico as far north as British
Columbia
Pathogenesis: High infestation levels may therefore cause anaemia.
Dermacentor andersoni may cause tick paralysis, particularly in calves,
caused by Anaplasma marginale. It also transmits the Colorado tick fever
virus, and the bacteria that cause tularaemia. Dermacentor andersoni is
the chief vector of Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky Mountain spotted fever) in
westernUSA.
Epidemiology: Adult numbers peak in May, then decline by July. Larvae
This species is particularly common amongst damp, grassy, brush-covered
areas, since these attract both the small mammals required by the
1589
adults. Infection occurs when host animals brush against vegetation
harbouring tick larvae.

Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: [xodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: These are ornate, pale brown and gray ticks with eyes and
festoons present (Fig. 1l.12). The basis capituli is rectangular and the
palps short. The males lack ventral plates and the coxae of the fourth pair
 of legs are enlarged with external spurs. Adult males are about 3-4 mm in
length and adult females about 4 mm in length when unfed and 15 mm in
length when engorged.

Hosts: Dog, horse, cattle, man. This tick will feed on many species of
domestic and wild mammals.
Life cycle: Dermacentror variabilis is a three-host tick, feeding once in
each of the larval, nymphal and adult life cycle stages. After each feed it
drops from the host. Mating takes place on the host. Once fertilised, the
adult female feeds for 5-27 days before dropping to the ground to lay
4000-6000 eggs in sheltered spots, after which she dies. Oviposition may
last 14-32 days, depending on temperature and humidity. The larvae hatch

paralysis in dogs. In cattle it may transmit bovine anaplasmosis. It is also
an important vector of Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky Mountain spotted
fever) in the USA and is able to transmit the bacteria which causes
tularaemia (hunter's disease). It also transmits St Louis encephalitis virus
and several studies have shown that it may carry the Lyme disease
bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi.

the ground. However, some males may remain attached to the host during
winter. Larvae and nymphs are active from spring to autumn, although
there is a general peak in adult activity from early spring to summer with a
second, lower peak in autumn. The development of D. silvarum from egg
to adult may require as little as 45 days at 28°C and 50 days at 25°C. The
threshold temperatures for larval and nymphal development are 8 and
10°C respectively. The life cycle may be completed in 1 year or, more
usually in most parts of its range, it is extended by one or more summer or
winter diapauses to 2-4 years.
Geographical distribution: Asia (central Siberia and northeastern China
to Japan)

Haemaphysalis punctata
Synonym: Haemaphysalis cinnabarina punctata
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: [xodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: Small, inornate ticks with eyes and festoons absent (Figs
11.15, 11.16). The palps and hypostome are short. The adults of both
sexes are about 3 mm in length, the female reaching about 12 mm in
length when engorged. Sexual dimorphism is not pronounced, however.
The basis capituli is rectangular, about twice as broad as long. The sensory
palps are short and broad, with the second segment extending beyond the
basis capituli. The anal groove is posterior to the anus. The coxae of the
first pair of legs have a short, blunt internal spur, which is also present on
the coxae of the second and third pair of legs and which is enlarged and
tapering on the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. In the male the spur may
be as long as the coxa.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, horse, deer, wolf, bear, bat, birds, rabbit. The
larvae and nymphs may also be found on birds, hedgehogs, rodents and
reptiles, such as lizards and snakes.
Life cycle: Haemaphysalis punctata is a three-host tick, feeding once in
each of the larval, nymphal and adult life cycle stages. After each
blood-meal it drops from the host. Engorgement on the host may take
6-30 days to complete. Once fed, each adult female lays 3000-5000 eggs
on the ground, over a period of 10 days to 7 months. Unfed larvae can
survive for up to 10 months, unfed nymphs and adults for 8.5 months.
Geographical distribution: Europe (including southern Scandinavia and
Britain), central Asia and North Africa
Pathogenesis: Haemaphysalis punctata is responsible for the transmission
of Babesia major and Babesia bigemina, Theileria mutans (T. buffelil/
1600
orientalis), Anaplasma marginaie and A. centraie in cattle. In sheep, it
transmits Babesia motasi and the benign Theileria ovis. It has also been
reported to cause tick paralysis. In addition to transmitting Anaplasma and
Babesia spp, different H. punctata populations are infected by tick-borne
encephalitis virus, Tribec virus, Bhanja virus, and Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever virus.

1601
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: [xodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Hosts: Dog, domestic and wild carnivores, small rodents and occasionally
cattle
Life cycle: Haemaphysalis leachi is a three-host tick, feeding once in each
of the larval, nymphal and adult life cycle stages. After each feed it drops
from the host. Each female lays approximately 5000 eggs. The eggs hatch
within 26-37 days, from where the emerging larvae attach to a host and
engorge after 2-7 days. They can survive exceptionally cold and dry
conditions. Unfed larvae can survive for over 6 months. The larvae drop
off the host and moult to the nymphal stage after approximately 30 days.
Nymphs attach to a host and become engorged after 2-7 days, after which
they drop off and moult to become adult after 10-16 days. Unfed nymphs
can survive for over 2 months. The adults attack a third host and engorge
within 8-l6 days, although they are able to survive unfed for 0ver 7
months.
Geographical distribution: Africa, Australia and Asia
Pathogenesis: This species is responsible for the transmission of canine
piroplasmosis (B. canis) in dogs, tickbite fever (Rickettsia conori) and
Coxiella burnetii.

HYALOMMA
Species of this genus are mediumsized or large ticks, with eyes and long
mouthparts. The males have ventral plates on each side of the anus.
Hyalomma spp are usually two-host ticks, though some species may use
three hosts. They are most commonly found on the legs, udder, tail or
perianal region. There are about 20 species, found usually in semi-desert
lowlands of central Asia, southern Europe and North Africa. They can
survive exceptionally cold and dry conditions.
Species of Hyalomma are usually inornate, but with banded legs (the
bont-legged tick'); eyes are present and festoons sometimes present. The
palps and hypostome, as in Amblyomma, are long (Fig. 11.4). The males
have adanal shields. The identification of more than the major species is
beyond the scope of this text and interested readers will need to consult a
relevant taxonomic specialist.

Hyalomma anatolicum
Sub-species: anatolicum
Common name: Bont-legged tick
Predilection site: All over the body but especially the axilla, inguinal
region, face and ears
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Hosts: Cattle, horse; all mammals and birds
Life cycle: This species is a two- or three-host tick. Larvae acquire a host,
Following engorgement nymphs drop off the host, moult to the adult stage

mating occurs and the female completes her single large blood meal.
Males feed intermittently and mate repeatedly. Once fertilised the female
feeds for about 14 days and then drops to the ground to lay several
thousand eggs in sheltered spots, after which she dies. The larvae and
nymphs feed on birds and small mammals, and the adults on ruminants
and equines. When larvae and nymphs infest smaller mammals, birds or
reptiles, the life cycle may become a three-host model.
Geographical distribution: Steppe and semi-desert environments from
central Asia to Bangladesh, the Middle and Near East, Arabia,
southeastern Europe and Africa. Hyalomma anatolicum is believed to
European and Asiatic parts of its range and Hyalomma anatolicum
anatolicum elsewhere. Some authors have suggested that these should be
viewed as separate species.
Pathogenesis: This genus is mainly responsible for tick toxicosis, in parts
of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The ‘toxin” produced by the adult
tick causes a sweating sickness in ruminants and pigs characterised by a
1607
widespread hyperaemia of the mucous membranes and a profuse moist
eczema. This is a highly damaging tick species. Hyalomma anatolicum
transmits Theileria annulata, T. equi, Babesia caballi, Anaplasma
marginafe,Trypanosomatheileriand atIeastfive arboviruses.
Notes: A closely related species, H. fusitanicum, replaces H. anatolicum
believed to be a vector of equine and bovine babesiosis.

first host for between 13 and 45 days. Nymphs drop off the host and then
moult to become adults. Subsequently the adult finds a second host where
the adult female engorges in 5-6 days. Unfed larvae can survive for 12
months, unfed nymphs for 3 months and unfed adults for 14 months.
Geographical distribution: Africa
Pathogenesis: This genus is responsible for tick toxicosis in parts of
southern Africa. The ‘toxin’ produced by the adult tick causes a sweating
sickness in ruminants and pigs characterised by a widespread hyperaemia
of the mucous membranes and a profuse moist eczema.
Hyalommadromedarii
Common name: Camel tick
1609
Predilection site: All over the body but especially the axilla, inguinal
region, face and ears
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: Hyalomma dromedarii are usually inornate but with banded
legs; eyes are present and festoons are sometimes present. The second
segment of the palps is usually less than twice as long as the third
segment, and the scutum has no pattern.
Host: Camels, but may also be of veterinary significance in ruminants and
horses
Life cycle: This is predominantly a two-host species of tick. Larvae
acquire a host, feed and moult. Nymphs reattach to the same host soon
after moulting. Following engorgement nymphs drop off the host, moult to
the adult stage and then acquire a new second host where they feed. After
attachment, mating occurs and the female completes her single large
blood-meal. Males feed intermittently and mate repeatedly. Once fertilised
the female feeds for about 14 days and then drops to the ground to lay
several thousand eggs in sheltered spots, after which she dies. In some
circumstances, a variable life cycle has been reported for H. dromedarii
with a three-host life cycle observed on sheep or cattle. It appears that the
type of host, rearing conditions, density and age of the larvae may
influence the life cycle adopted by this species

Clinical signs: There are no obvious signs of tick infestation other than
the presence of the parasites and the local skin reactions to their bites.
Diagnosis: The adult ticks, particularly the engorged females, are easily
seen on the skin. The main predilection sites are the face, ears, axilla and
inguinal region.
Pathology: Small granulomatous reactions may form at the site of tick
bites consisting of a mixed inflammatory cell response with fibrosis.

and coxae are dark, reddish or black-brown. The males have adanal
shields. The second segment of the palps is less than twice as long as the
third segment, and the scutum has no pattern.
Hosts: This species feeds primarily on burrowing rodents, particularly as
larvae and nymphs. However, adults will also feed on ruminants and
equines, where this species may be of veterinary significance.
Life cycle: Species of Hyalomma usually have a two-host life cycle, with
larvae and nymphs remaining and feeding on the same host. The engorged

Life cycle: The members of this species complex have a two-host life
cycle, larvae and nymphs remaining and feeding on the same host. The
engorged nymphs drop to the ground and moult to become an adult.
1612
Subsequently the adult feeds and engorges on a second host. The life cycle
takes a minimum of 14 weeks from egg to adult.
Geographical distribution: Africa, Asia Minor and southern Europe:
·H. marginatum marginatum (Caspian area of Iran and CIS to
 Portugal and northwestern Africa)

Nile Valley and southern Arabia)
·H. marginatum turanicum (Pakistan, Iran, southern CIS, Arabia,
parts of northeastern Africa)
· H. marginatum isaaci (Sri Lanka to southern Nepal, Pakistan,
northern Afghanistan).
Pathogenesis: The salivary secretions of this species may also produce

RHIPICEPHALUS
The genus is composed of about 60 species, all of which were originally
endemic to the Old World and, for the most part, distributed throughout
sub-Saharan Africa. However, many species have now been introduced
into a range of new habitats worldwide. They act as vectors of a number
of disease pathogens. They infest a variety of mammals but seldom birds
are two-host ticks.
The basis capituli is hexagonal (Fig. 11.4) and, in the male, paired plates
are found on each side of the anus. They are not ornate. Palps are short
and eyes and festoons are usually present. Spiracular plates are
comma-shaped. The identification of more than the major species is
beyond the scope of this text and interested readers will need to consult a
relevant taxonomic specialist.
Rhipicephalus appendiculatus
Common name: Brown ear tick
Predilection site: Skin; ears
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
1615
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: Adult male R. appendiculatus are brownish, reddish brown,
or very dark, with reddish brown legs. They vary from 1.8-4.4 mm in
 is    s   s  
the lateral grooves and in the lateral fields. The cervical grooves are
moderately reticulate  or  non-reticulate. The  posteromedian and
para-median grooves are narrow and distinct. The adanal shields are long
and have slightly rounded angles, but can be somewhat variable.
Adult female R. appendiculatus are also brown, reddish brown, or very
dark. The punctuations are small to moderate sized and are similar to
those found in the male. The scutum is approximately equal in length and
width; its posterior margin is slightly tapering or abruptly rounded. The
lateral grooves are short, poorly defined or absent. The cervical grooves
are long and shallow and almost reach the posterolateral margins.
Hosts: Cattle, horse, sheep, goat, deer, antelope, dog, rodents. This
species of tick will feed on a wide variety of mammals and birds.
Life cycle: This species is a three-host tick and mating takes place on the
host.
Geographical distribution: Africa, south of the Sahara. It occurs
particularly in areas with substantial rainfall and shrub cover and it is
absentin deserts.
Pathogenesis: This tick is considered a major pest in areas where it is
endemic. Heavy infestations on cattle can result in severe damage to the
ears and toxaemia. The excess blood excreted by the ticks may attract flies
leading to secondary myiasis. Tick bites may become infected with
         s
infestations can result in fatal toxaemia and loss of resistance to other
infections as well as severe damage to the host's ears, udder and tail. R.
appendiculatus is a vector of east coast fever (Theileria parva), T.
lawrencei, Nairobi sheep disease (NSD) virus, Ehrlichia bovis,
Hepatozoon canis, Rickettsia conorii and Thogoto virus.
1616
Epidemiology: Adults and immatures feed in the ears of cattle and other
livestock and seasonal activity is closely associated with temperature and
rain periods. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus is more abundant in cool,
shaded shrubby or woody savannas with at least 60 cm of annual rainfall.
Control: Weekly dipping during the tick season should kill the adult
female ticks before they are engorged, except in cases of very severe
challenge when the dipping interval has to be reduced to 4 or 5 days.
Dipping intervals of this latter frequency are also necessary for cattle
infested with R. appendiculatus in areas where east coast fever is endemic
so that the ticks are killed before the sporozoites of T. parva have time to
           
Theoretically, weekly dipping should also control the larvae and nymphs,
but in several areas the peak infestations of larvae and nymphs occur at
different seasons to the adult females and the duration of the dipping
season has to be extended.

1618
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Parasitiformes
Sub-order: Ixodida (Metastigmata)
Family: Ixodidae
Description: This species can be distinguished from other members of the
genus by its red legs. It has a black scutum, which is densely pitted, and in
the male leaves a red margin of the opisthosoma uncovered.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep, goat, horse, dog. All mammals and birds
Life cycle: This is a two-host species of tick. The larval and nymphal
stages engorge on the same host. The female lays approximately
depending on the temperature and climatic conditions. Larvae and nymphs
remain on the host for between 10 and 15 days before dropping to the
ground. Nymphs then moult after 42-56 days. Subsequently, adults locate
a second host, when the adult female engorges in 6-10 days. The larvae
and nymphs are commonly found in the ears or the inguinal region, while
the adults are mainly found under the tail. Unfed larvae can survive for 7
months, while unfed adults can survive for 14 months.
Geographical distribution: Africa, south of the Sahara
Pathogenesis: Rhipicephaius evertsi is a major vector for the transmission
of east coast fever, Theileria parva, redwater, Babesia bigemina and T.
mutans of cattle. It also transmits Borrelia in various animals, and biliary
fever, Theileria equi,in horses.

Pathogenesis: Rhipicephalus sanguineus is primarily parasitic on dogs
and is responsible for the transmission of Babesia canis and Ehrlichia
canis and can also cause tick paralysis in the dog. There seems little doubt
that it can also transmit many protozoal, viral and rickettsial infections of
animals and man. These include Theileria equi and B. caballi of equines,
Anaplasma marginale in North America, Hepatozoon canis of dogs,
Coxielia burnetii, Rickettsia conorii, R. canis, R. rickettsii, Pasteureila
tularensis, Borrelia hispanica and the viruses that cause Nairobi sheep
disease and other viral diseases of sheep in Africa. Rhipicephalus
sanguineus is also a vector for east coast fever (Theileria parva) among
cattle, Babesia perroncitoi and Babesia trautmanni among pigs, and
transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever in some areas of the USA and
Mexico.

Immature stages feed on the common burrowing savannah rodents.
Geographic distribution: Central and southern Africa
Pathogenesis: It is believed to act as a vector of Anaplasma marginale, A.
centrale, Rickettsia conorii and Coxiella burneti. It can also cause tick
paralysis in humans.
1622
Notes: In eastern and northern Africa R. simeus is replaced by R.
praetextatus, which ranges from central Tanzania to Egypt and which is a
vector of Thogoto virus. West of the Nile, these species are replaced by R.
senegalensis and R.muhsamae.
MITES
Most mites are relatively host specific and are discussed in their relevant
host chapter.
TROMBICULIDAE
Species of the family Trombiculidae are commonly known as chiggers.
red bugs, harvest mites and scrub itch mites, and are unique, in that only
the larval stage is ectoparasitic. In the adult and nymphal stages they are
believed to be predators on the eggs and larvae of other arthropods. The
principal species of veterinary interest are in the genus Trombicula.
They feed on blood, which they ingest by puncturing the skin.
Clinical signs: Infestation can result in pruritus, erythema, weals, papules
and excoriation, leading to hair loss.

surface. Microscopic examination may then be used to identify individual
species.
Treatment: In most cases, the dermatitis should resolve a few days after
the larvae have left the skin, however acarididal treatment may be
necessary. Topical acaricides, such as organophosphates (e.g- phosmet,
chlorpyriphos, malathion or diazinon), fipronil or lime-sulphur can be
used, depending on the host infested.
Control:  Environmental  treatment  with  cyfluthrin,  cyhalothrin,
deltamethrin, carbaryl and deltamethrin may help to reduce mite
abundance in areas such as back yards. However, area-wide control is
avoidance of sites of known mite prevalence.

Pathogenesis: Infestation causes pruritus, erythema and scratching,

excoriation leading to hair loss. In some cases, pruritus occasionally may
continue long after the larvae have left, and heavy infestations may also
induce systemic effects such as fever.
Neotrombiculaautumnalis
Synonym: Trombicuia autumnalis
Common name: Harvest mite
Predilection site: Harvest mites are commonly found in clusters on the
foot and up the legs of dogs, on the genital area and eyelids of cats, on the
face of cattle and horses and on the heads of birds, having been picked up
from the grass.
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Trombiculidae
Fig. 11.18 Parasitic larval stage of the Harvest mite Neotrombicula
(Trombicuia) autumnalis (reproduced from Savory, 1935).
1624
Description: The hexapod larvae are rounded, red to orange in colour and
about 0.2 mm in length (Fig. 11.18). The scutum bears a pair of sensillae
and five setae. In N. autumnalis the scutum is roughly pentangular and has
 numerous small punctuations. There are two simple eyes on each side of
the scutum. The body is covered dorsally with 25-50 relatively long,
       e 
five-segmented palps. The palpal femur and genu each bear a single seta.
The palpal tibia has three setae and a thumb-like terminal claw, which
opposes the palpal tarsus. The palpal claw is three-pronged (trifurcate).
Adults and nymphs have a pronounced figure-of-eight shape. They have
stigmata, which open at the base of the chelicerae and their bodies are
covered with setae. Adults are about l mm in length.
Hosts: Dogs, cats, cattle, horses, rabbits and birds
Life cycle: They are parasitic only in the larval stage. Female adults lay
their spherical eggs in damp but well drained soil. After about a week the
1625
hexapod larva hatches from the egg and begins to crawl about the soil,
eventually climbing an object such as a grass stem. Here it awaits a
passing host. Larvae of the species of veterinary interest are not highly
host specific and may attach to a variety of domestic animals. The larva
attaches itself by its blade-like chelicerae and feeds on the host's serous
tissues for several days before falling from the host. After feeding, the
larva enters a quiescent stage for a few days as a nymphochrysalis, before
moulting to become the active octopod nymph. After a further inactive
imagochrysalis nymphal stage, the adult emerges. The nymphal and adult
stages are free- living, mobile and predatory. The life cycle typically
requires 50-70 days. Neotrombicula autumnalis passes through only one
 generation per year and its abundance is usually strongly seasonal.
Geographical distribution: Europe
Epidemiology: In Europe the activity of Neotrombicuia autumnalis is
most pronounced in late summer and autumn, and larvae are most active
on dry, sunny days. It will parasitise almost all domestic mammals,
including humans and some ground-nesting birds. N. autumnalis may be
particularly abundant in closely cropped chalk grassland, but it may also
be found in wooded areas and scrub.
Eutrombicula alfreddugesi
Synonym:Trombiculaalfreddugesi
Common name: Chigger mite
Predilection site: Commonly face, muzzle, thigh and belly
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-crder: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Trombiculidae
Description: The larvae of E. alfreddugesi, known as chiggers, are similar
in appearance to those of N. autumnalis. They are reddish orange and vary
1626
However, for the larvae of E. alfreddugesi the palpal claws are
two-pronged (bifurcate), the scutum is approximately rectangular and 22
dorsal setae are present.
Hosts: Dogs, cats, cattle, horses, rabbits, birds
Life cycle: The life cycle is similar to that described for N. autumnalis.
Adult chiggers are free living while the immature stages are parasitic.
Infestation is most common around the face, muzzle, thigh and belly. The
resulting pruritus may persist for several days and is generally a
hypersensitivity reaction to the mite saliva, occurring after the individual
has detached.
Geographical distribution: Eutrombicula alfreddugesi is the most
important and widespread of the trombiculid mites of veterinary interest in
     o  s i   
America.
Epidemiology: Eurombicula alfreddugesi is particularly common at the
margins of woodland, scrub and grassland, but is not highly habitat
July and September, whereas in more southern habitats it may be active all
year round. E. alfreddugesi parasitises a wide range of mammals and
birds.
Eutrombicula splendens
Synonym: Trombicula spiendens
Common name: Chigger mite
Predilection site: Commonly on the face, feet or legs
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Trombiculidae
1627
Description: Eurombicuia spiendens is morphologically similar and
frequently sympatric with E. alfreddugesi in North America.
Geographical distribution: North America; generally confined to the
east, from Ontario in Canada to the Gulf States, although it may also be
abundant in Florida and parts of Georgia.
Epidemiology: This species generally occurs in moister habitats than E.
alfreddugesi, such as swamps and bogs.
Eutrombicula sarcina
Synonym: Trombicula sarcina
Common name: Scrub itch mite, black soil itch mite
Predilection site: Commonly on the face, feet or legs
Parasite class: Arachnida
Sub-class: Acari
Order: Acariformes
Sub-order: Trombidiformes (Prostigmata)
Family: Trombiculidae
Description: The parasitic larvae are small (0.2 mm long), round mites
with numerous setae.
Geographical distribution: A ustralasia
Epidemiology: The scrub itch mite Eutrombicuia sarcina is an important
parasite of sheep in Queensland and New South Wales of Australia.[ts
principal host, however, is the grey kangaroo. These mites prefer areas of
savannah and grassland scrub. They may be particularly abundant from
November to February, after summer rain. The primary site of infestation
is on the leg, resulting in intense irritation.
1628
INSECTS
FLEAS: SIPHONAPTERA
The fleas are small, wingless, obligate, blood-feeding insects. Over 95%
of flea species are ectoparasites of mammals, while the others are
ectoparasites of birds. The order is relatively small with about 2500
described species, almost all of which are morphologically extremely
similar.
Pathogenesis: The wounds created at the feeding site are usually seen as
erythematous papules or wheals, surrounding the central puncture site.
The wounds may develop a crust of dried exudate. The wheals may persist
for several weeks. Pruritis may be intense, resulting in secondary
traumatic lesions.
bite may produce a small, raised wheal on the skin.
Diagnosis: When the signs are indicative of flea infestation, but no
parasites can be found, the host should be sprayed with an insecticide,
placed on a large sheet of plastic or paper, and vigorously combed or
groomed. The combings and debris should be examined for fleas or flea
faeces, which show as dark brown-black crescentic particles. Consisting
almost entirely of blood, these will produce a spreading reddish stain
when placed on moist tissue.
Another technique is the use of a vacuum cleaner with fine gauze inserted
behind the nozzle; the latter is applied to the host or its habitat and the
fleas are retained on the gauze.
Treatment: In flea-bite allergy, where there is much distress,
corticosteroids may be used topically or systemically as palliative
treatment.
For specific treatment, insecticides are available, mainly in the form of
powders, sprays, shampoos or spot-on preparations. These are generally
organophosphorus compounds, pyrethrum and its derivatives, or
carbamates. There are also oral and in-feed formulations of drugs for use

against fleas in dogs and one of these is a benzoylurea derivative.

insect growth regulators (chitin synthesis inhibitors, juvenile hormone
analogues) applied directly to the animal, not only increases ovicidal and/
or larvicidal activity but also delivers it effectively to the sleeping areas
environment. Insect growth regulators do not kill adult fleas and are not
suitable by themselves for flea control, unless used in a completely closed
environment. For flea infestations of domestic animals, frequent
should be washed at high temperatures.
Ctenocephalides felis
Subspecies: felis
Subspecies: strongylus
Subspecies: damarensi
Subspecies: orientalis
Common name: Cat flea
1630
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Siphonaptera
Family: Pulicidae
Description: Cat fleas are dark brown-black, wingless insects, with
laterally compressed bodies, which have a glossy surface. Females
typically measure 2.5 mm in length; males are smaller, sometimes less
than 1 mm in length. Eyes, are simply dark, photosensitive spots, and the
antennae, which are short and club-like, are recessed into the head. In the
female C. f felis the head is twice as long as high and pointed anteriorly.
In the male C. f felis the head is as long as wide but is also slightly
elongate anteriorly (Fig. 11.19). The third pair of legs is much longer than
the others and, coupled to elaborate internal musculature, provide an
adaptation for jumping to locate their host. The head bears at its posterior
(pronotal) or ventral (genal) borders rows of dark spines called ctenidia or
'combs', and these are the most important features used in identification
(Fig. 11.19). The genal ctenidium consists of 7-8 spines and the pronotal
ctenidium about 16 spines. The teeth of the genal ctenidium are all about
the same length. On the dorsal border of the hind (metathoracic) tibia in
both sexes of C.f. felis there are only six notches bearing setae (Fig.
11.19). Between the postmedian and apical long setae there is a short,
subapical spine.

Hosts: Cat, dog, human
Life cycle: Both sexes are blood feeders, and only the adults are parasitic.
Once on its host C. f. felis tends to become a permanent resident. Within
24 48 hours of the first blood meal females begin to oviposit. The pearly
white ovoid eggs (Fig. 11.20), which measure 0.5 mm in length, have

per day, 0ver a life of about 50-100 days. However, on a cat, the average
lifespan is probably substantially lower than this, possibly less than 1
week. The rate of oviposition is highest at times of day when cats
normally rest, in the early morning and late afternoon. As a result, flea
eggs are concentrated at host resting sites rather than over the large areas
they roam. The eggs cannot withstand major climatic variations,
appropriate environment will ultimately develop into adults. At 70%
relative humidity and 35°C, 50% 0f eggs hatch within 1.5 days. At 70%
relative humidity and 15°℃ it takes 6 days for 50% of eggs to hatch. Eggs
cannot survive below 50% relative humidity.

surroundings. The creamy yellow larvae are elongate, slender and
maggot-like (Fig. 11.21); each segment carries a ring of bristles. The last
abominal segment bears two hooked processes called anal struts, which
are used for gripping in locomotion. They have chewing mouthparts and

Within the host's bedding, den or lair the larvae of C. f. felis exist in a
protected environment, with relatively high humidity, buffered from the
extreme fluctuations of ambient temperatures and provided with detritus
and a source of adult flea faecal blood. The larvae have limited powers of
movement (probably less than 20 cm before pupation) and crawl about
their environment largely at random, but they are negatively phototactic
takes them to the base of carpets where they can encounter food and are
sheltered from light and mechanical damage. The larva moults twice, the
final stage being about 5.0 mm long. At 24°C and 75% relative humidity.
the duration of the three larval stages is about 1 week, but in unfavourable
conditions, larvae may develop more slowly. At 13°C and 75% relative
humidity larval development takes about 5 weeks, though the larval cycle
can take up to 200 days. Larvae will only survive at temperatures between
13°C and 35°C. The larvae are extremely susceptible to desiccation and
mortality is high below 50% relative humidity.
When fully developed, the mature third-stage larva empties its gut and
spins a thin, silk cocoon. This process requires a vertical surface against
which they can align themselves. Fragments of detritus adhere to the
cocoon. At 24°C and 78% relative humidity the duration of the pupal
stage is about 8-9 days. If the pupal stage is disturbed the larvae will
either spin another cocoon or develop into naked pupae showing that the

the cocoon. Adults may remain in this state for up to 140 days at 11°C and
75% relative humidity. At cooler temperatures, fully formed fleas may
The areas within a building with the necessary humidity for egg and larval
development are limited. Sites outdoors are even less common and fle2
larvae cannot develop in arid areas exposed to the hot sun. If found
Outside they typically inhabit the top few millimetres of soil.
Emergence of the adult from the cocoon is triggered by stimuli such as
mechanical pressure, vibrations or heat. Adult emergence may be
extremely rapid, when provided with appropriate conditions. The ability to
remain within the cocoon for extended periods is essential for a species
such as C. f. felis since its mobile hosts may only return to the lair or
1634
 n  s       
almost as soon as they are on their host, though they can survive for
several days without feeding, provided the relative humidity is above
about 60%. Within 36 hours of adult emergence most females will have
mated. Females will mate with several males and egg laying begins 24-48
hours after the first blood meal.
Within 10 minutes of feeding adults begin to produce faeces. Partially
digested host blood forms a large component of the flea faeces. The faeces
quickly dries into reddish black faecal pellets, known as *flea dirt'.
It is important to recognise that most of the flea's life cycle is spent away
from the host. This includes not only the eggs, larvae and cocoon, but
also, if necessary, the adult flea.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. However, there are four distinct
subspecies of C. felis: C. felis felis is widespread, C. f strongyfus occurs
in Africa, C. f. damarensis in southwestern Africa and C. f orientalis in
India,Sri Lanka and southeast Asia.
Pathogenesis: The response to a flea bite is a raised, slightly inflamed
wheal on the skin, associated with mild pruritus, but though the animal
will scratch intermittently there is little distress. However, after repeated
flea bites over a period of several months a proportion of dogs and cats
develop flea-bite allergy, which is often associated with profound clinical
signs (Fig. 11.22)
  o  l se  s n  s     
day, severe infestations may lead to iron-deficiency anaemia. Anaemia
caused by C. f felis is particularly prevalent in young animals and has
been reported in cats and dogs and, very rarely, goats, cattle and sheep.
Flea-bite allergy is a hypersensitive reaction to components of the flea
saliva released into the skin during feeding. The allergy shows a
seasonality in temperate areas, appearing in summer when flea activity is
highest, though in centrally heated homes exposure may be continuous. In
warmer regions, such as the western states of the USA, the problem occurs
throughout the year. As would be expected, the most commonly affected
areas in both dogs and cats are the preferential biting sites of the fleas,
which are the back, the ventral abdomen and the inner thighs. In the dog
the primary lesions are discrete crusted papules which cause intense
1635
pruritus. The most important damage, however, is subsequently inflicted
by the animals themselves, in scratching and biting the affected areas, to
produce areas of alopecia or of moist dermatitis ('wet eczema'). In older
q  s  '  g oa    'so
thickened, folded and hairless, and in these animals the pruritus is much
less intense. In the cat, flea-bite allergy produces the condition commonly
known as miliary dermatitis or eczema, readily detectable on palpation, in
which the skin is covered with innumerable small, brown, crusty papules
which cause marked pruritus. In cats, there are two distinct clinical
manifestations associated with flea allergy: milary dermatitis and feline
symmetrical alopecia.
Fig. 11.22 The lesions of flea bite allergy in a cat.
Flea-allergy dermatitis is one of the most common causes of
dermatological disease of dogs and cats. Dermatitis associated with
the skin, with itching persisting up to 5 days after the bite. The resultant
licking, chewing and scratching can lead to hair loss, self-induced trauma
and secondary infection. Other symptoms include restlessness, irritability
and weight loss, though the intensity of irritation varies greatly with the
individual attacked.
All dogs can become allergic to fleas, though atopic dogs are predisposed
to developing reactivity. One bite may be sufficient to cause an allergic
reaction. Intermittent flea exposure encourages development of a flea
1636
allergy, while continual exposure appears to protect against it, as does
contact with fleas at an early age. Though little is known about the
allergens responsible for evoking the allergic response, recent findings

canine [gG or IgE, at least 15 different flea components have been found
to bind IgE. No pattern of reactivity or differences in antibody structure

antibody responses and allergic reactivity of dogs to fleas. Both immediate
and delayed hypersensitivity can be observed, and individuals will vary in
the strength and proportion of each type of sensitivity they express. Dogs
tolerance resulting in loss of clinical signs.
Cats kept in a flea infested environment groom at twice the rate of cats in
a flea-free environment. In normal grooming a cat may ingest almost 50%
of its resident flea population within a few days and cats fitted with
Elizabethan collars, which prevent grooming, harbour much greater
populations of fleas than cats free to groom. The removal of fleas during
grooming reduces the chance of finding them during a skin and coat
examination. This is a particular diagnostic problem in cats with a low flea
burden but marked flea-bite hypersensitivity. In such cases, since many of
the groomed fleas are ingested, examination of the mouth may reveal fleas
caught in the spines of the cat's tongue.
Fleas are vectors of a range of viruses and bacteria, and pathogen
transmission is enhanced by their promiscuous feeding habits. Most
species of flea are host-preferential rather than host-specific and will try to
50 different host species. Other factors which contribute to the potential of
C. felis as a vector include transovarial transmission of some pathogens
(Rickettsia species) and the transmission of pathogens such as Bartonella
henselae through adult flea faeces.
 s o o  n  s  s  s
cats,Dipylidium caninum.Though the adult flea can acquire the filarioid
infection by intake of microfilariae in a blood meal, the specialised
mouthparts do not allow the ingestion of the eggs of Dipylidium, and this
1637
with general organic debris, are ingested by flea larvae. The tapeworm
eggs hatch in the midgut of the flea larva and the worm larvae penetrate
the gut wall, passing into the haemocoel. The tapeworm larvae develop
development, eventually encapsulating as an infective cysticercoid. After
ingestion of the adult flea by the host, cysticercoids are liberated and
develop into tapeworms in the digestive tract.

Ctenocephalides felis felis also acts as an intermediate host of the
non-pathogenic, subcutaneous filaroid nematode of dogs Dipetalonema
reconditum, which adults may ingest during blood-feeding.
Epidemiology: The cat flea, C. f felis, is the most common species of flea
found on domestic cats and dogs throughout North America and northern
Europe. Significantly more cats are infested with fleas than dogs,
however, perhaps because of their tendency to roam, increasing their
   s         
but, in the northern hemisphere, numbers tend to increase around late
spring and early autumn when ambient conditions are favourable for larval
development. Since C. felis are able to survive for long periods off the
host they therefore do not require direct contact for transmission.
1638
Ctenocephalides canis
Common name: Dog flea
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Siphonaptera
Family: Pulicidae
Description: The dog flea, C. canis, is closely related and is
morphologically very similar to the cat flea, C. f felis, although they
cannot interbreed and, therefore, are truly distinct species. The head of the
female dog flea is more rounded on its upper and anterior surface than that
of the cat flea and less than twice as long as high (Fig. 11.23). Like C. f
felis, the dog flea has both genal and pronotal ctenidia (Fig. 11.24). The
genal ctenidium consists of seven to eight spines and the pronotal
ctenidium about 16 spines (Fig. 11.23). However, in both female and male
C. canis the first spine of the genal ctenidium is shorter than the rest. On
the dorsal border of the hind (metathoracic) tibia in both sexes of C. canis
there are eight notches bearing stout setae (Fig. 11.23).
Hosts: Dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, foxes and humans have all been recorded
as hosts of C. canis.
Fig. 11.24 Adult Ctenocephalides canis.
1639
Life cycle: The life cycle of C. canis (egg, veriform larva, pupa and adult)
is very similar to that of C. f felis. Egg production commences 2 days
after the male and female arrive on the dog. Eggs and larvae do not
survive at temperatures of over 35 °C, preferring a temperature range
between 13 and 32°C and relative humidity between 50 and 90%. [n these
conditions even unfed adults can survive for many weeks. Pupae may
remain dormant for a year or more, yet are able to hatch in 30 seconds
when cues, such as vibration, indicate the presence of a suitable host. In an
appropriate environment the total life cycle may take as little as 3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Similar to that of C. f. felis.
Epidemiology: The behavioural differences between dog and cat fleas
seem largely to involve the range of environmental conditions which their
larvae are capable of tolerating. While household dogs in northern Europe
             
dogs in kennels and dogs in rural areas or at higher altitudes are more
likely to be infested by C. canis.
Archaeopsylla erinacei
Common name: Hedgehog flea
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Siphonaptera
Family: Pulicidae
Description: Adults are easily recognised, being 2-3.5 mm long with a
 genal comb of one to three short spines and a pronotal comb of one short
spine (Fig. 11.25).
Hosts: Hedgehogs, dogs and cats
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, three larval stages, pupa and
adult. Before the female can begin ovipositing she needs to feed on the
permanent resident.
1640
Geographical distribution: Europe and North America
Epidemiology: Archaeopsylla erinacei occurs on hedgehogs and may be
transferred to dogs and cats following contact.
Pulex irritans
Common name: Human flea
Predilection site: Skin
Fig. 11.25 The hedgehog flea, Archaeopsylla erinacei, female head (after
Smart, 1943).
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasite order: Siphonaptera
Family: Pulicidae
Description: Pulex irritans has neither genal nor pronotal ctenidia (Fig.
11.26). The outer margin of the head is smoothly rounded and there is a
1641
pair of eyes. This species can be distinguished from X. cheopis by the
presence of the single ocular bristle below the eye and the absence of a
row of bristles along the rear margin of the head. The metacoxae have a
about halfway down the forecoxae, which distinguishes this species from
the closely related Pulex simulans found in Hawaii (where the laciniae
extend for at least three quarters the length of the forecoxae).
Hosts: Humans and pigs; may also occur on dogs, cats, rats and badgers
Life cycle: The life cycle is typical: egg, three larval stages, pupa and
adult. It is thought that originally the principal hosts of this species were
pigs. Each adult female P. irritans lays around 400 eggs.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, but it is now uncommon in the
USA and most of northern Europe.
Pathogenesis: The bites of Pulex can cause dermatitis and it may on

1642
Epidemiology: Although described as the human flea, P. irritans can
infest cats, dogs, and many other domestic animals, although it is probably
most common on pigs. It breeds profusely in pigsties and is usually the
most important species in farm areas. People working with infested pigs
can also easily become infested and start infestations in their homes.
Spilopsyllus cuniculi
Common name: Rabbit flea, European rabbit flea
Predilection site:Ears
Parasite class:Insecta
Parasite order:Siphonaptera
Family: Pulicidae
Hosts: Rabbit, hare, dog, cat
1643
Description: The rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, has both pronotal and genal
ctenidia, the latter being composed of four to six oblique spines (Fig.
11.27). Adults are dark brown. Females are, on average, 1 mm in length;
males are slightly smaller. Eyes are present and the frons at the front of
the head is rounded with the frontal tubercle conspicuous. There are two
stout spines beneath the eye.
Hosts: Rabbit, hare, dog, cat
Fig. 11.27 Head and pronotum of the rabbit flea, Spilopsyllus cuniculi.
Life cycle: The rabbit flea, S. cunicufi, occurs largely on the ears. It is
more sedentary than most other species of flea and remains for long
         s
increasingly active and mobile after feeding on a pregnant doe. Adults
transfer to newborn young and lay eggs. The larvae feed on organic matter
in the nest debris and mature 15-45 days later when they infest the host
littermates before they disperse from the burrow. Populations of S.
1644
Goegraphical distribution: Worldwide
cuniculi is related to skin temperature, with fleas usually congregating on
the ears. Because they assemble here in large numbers, the intensity of
bites may cause considerable irritation and tissue damage. Rabbit fleas
may also be found on cats and dogs, which hunt or frequent rabbit
habitats. On these hosts they are commonly found on the face and attached
to the pinneal margin. Spilopsylius cuniculi is the main vector of
myxomatosis and it also transmits the non-pathogenic Trypanosoma
nabiasi.

Family:Pulicidae
Description: The sticktight flea, E. gallinacea, is a burrowing flea
important mainly in domestic poultry. The adult sticktight flea is small:
females are commonly about 2 mm in length and the males are less than 1
mm in length. The head is sharply angled at the front (frons). There are no
genal or pronotal ctenidia (Fig. 11.28). On the head behind the antenna
there are two setae and, in the female, usually a well developed occipital
lobe. The thoracic segments are narrowed dorsally. Spiracles are present
 on the second and third abdominal segments. The mouthparts appear
large, extending the length of the forecoxae, and project from the head
conspicuously. The maxillary laciniae are broad and coarsely serrated. On
the anteroventral surface of each hind coxa, there are three rows of minute
spiniform bristles.
Hosts: Poultry, but may also attack cats, dogs, rabbits and humans
Life cycle: After host location, females aggregate on bare areas, often the
head, comb or wattles. Newly emerged adults are active and move
1646
towards sunlight, which helps them accumulate on the wattles of cocks or
hens. After feeding, females burrow into the skin where they attach firmly
  e        
and 6 weeks. Copulation then takes place. The skin around the point of
attachment may become ulcerated. The female begins oviposition an
average of 6-10 days after attachment, at a rate of about 1-4 eggs per day.
Eggs are laid in the ulceration or dropped to the ground. If laid in the
ulceration, larvae hatch, emerge from the skin and drop to the ground to
complete their development. The incubation period may last from 4-14
days, though typically it takes 6-8 days. Eggs fail to survive temperatures
of 43°C and above.Thelarvae feed onchicken manure and develop
through three larval stages over a period of 14-3l days. The pupal period
generally requires around 9-19 days and the entire life cycle may be
completed in 30-60 days. Adults generally locate a new host and attach
within about 5-8 days after emergence.

areas throughout the world, but may also be found in many subtropical
and temperate habitats.
Pathogenesis: The burrowing of adults and subsequent emergence of
larvae through the skin tissue can result in areas of ulceration, leading to
secondary bacterial infection. Sticktight fleas can occur at densities of
over 1o0 individuals per bird, all concentrated on the head. As a result,
infestation of poultry may reduce growth and egg production. Severe
infestation can lead to anaemia. Ocular ulceration, caused by self-trauma,
becomes ulcerated, and young birds may be killed by heavy infections
buildings. They are potentially able to transmit the plague and murine
typhus but, since the females spend most of their lives attached to a single
host, they are not considered to be significant vectors of disease
Clinical signs: Signs include restlessness and sratching of affected areas.
The bites may be visible on the skin. Allergic dermatitis may be seen, but
should be differentiated from other similar conditions such as sarcoptic
mange.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is not easy as adults may leave the host and eggs
and larvae are difficult to find. Poultry sometimes have clusters of these
1647
fleas around the eyes, comb, wattles and other bare spots. These dark
brown fleas have their heads embedded in the host's flesh and cannot be
around the margin of the outer ear or occasionally between the toe pads.
Epidemiology: These fleas are not host specific and may attack any
available mammal or bird for a blood meal. As they are able to survive off
the host, transmission can occur from the bedding and housing. Primarily
important as a parasite of birds, the adult sticktight flea is an especially
serious pest of chickens. However, it may also be found on humans, rats,
cats, dogs, horses and larger insectivores. Infestations on dogs may be
fleas are found on the poorly haired areas of the ventrum, scrotum,
interdigital and periorbital skin and around the pinnae of the ears.
Treatment: Sticktight fleas can be removed with tweezers by grasping
and pulling firmly. An antibiotic ointment should be applied to the area to
prevent infection. If fleas are too numerous to remove individually, a flea
product registered for on-animal use should be applied according to label
instructions. Several organophosphorus, carbamate and pyrethrin-based
insecticides are effective when applied as a solution.
drastic measures may have to be adopted to get rid of them. All litter
should be removed and burnt and the poultry house sprayed with an
insecticide.
Ceratophyllus gallinae
Common name: European chicken flea
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta

Family: Ceratophyllidae
Description: Adults of Ceratophyllus gallinae are typically 2-2.5 mm
long with no antennal fossae. Eyes are present. There is a pronotal comb.
carrying more than 24 teeth, while the genal comb is absent (Fig. 11.29).

There is a lateral row of four to six bristles on the inner surface of the hind
femur and there are no spines on the basal section of the legs.
Hosts: Poultry, wild birds, dog, cat, humans

If the nest is reused by birds the following year, the newly emerged adults
will attach to the new hosts and continue the cycle. If the nest is not
reused, the newly emerged adults will make their way to the nest entrance,
where they may be able attach to a bird that is examining the old nest as a
potential nest site. Alternatively they may climb up trees and bushes; here
they stop periodically and face the brightest source of light, jumping in
response to a shadow passing in front of the light.
Geographical distribution: Found predominantly in the Old World but
has been introduced into southeast Canada and northeast USA
Pathogenesis: Ceratophyfius gallinae is the commonest flea of domestic
poultry. It is not however considered to be an important vector of disease.
Feeding activity may cause irritation, restlessness and, with heavy
infestations, anaemia.
Clinical signs: Symptoms include restlessness and scratching of affected
areas. The bites may be visible on the skin. Allergic dermatitis may be

the host, transmission can occur from the bedding and housing. This flea
is highly mobile on the host and can be especially common in host nesting
material. It will feed readily on humans and domestic pets, and is often
acquired in the handling of poultry and from injured wild birds brought
into houses. It has also been known to migrate into rooms from nests
incinerated; otherwise the hungry fleas may parasitise domestic pets and

Notes: The European chicken flea, Ceratophyllus gallinae, is a very
common flea of poultry and also infests more than 75 species of wild bird
and some mammals. In Europe, the vast majority of its hosts are
hole-nesting tits, particularly great tits and blue tits. This species
originated in Europe and has spread with poultry operations round the
world. It is difficult to eradicate, as it is able to feed on many different
species and is highly adaptable.
Tungapenetrans
Common name: Chigger, jigger, chigoe, bicho do pe or sand flea
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Parasiteorder:Siphonaptera
Family: Pulicidae
Description: Tunga penetrans has no ctenidia and no spiniform bristles
on the metathoracic coxae. The head is angular and has an acute frontal
angle. The thorax is short and reddish brown. The female is about l mm
1651
long before a blood meal but may increase to a length of up to 7 mm when
gravid. The male flea is smaller, about 0.5 mm long, and never embeds in
the host.
Hosts: Humans and pigs. In addition, reservoir hosts include cattle, sheep,
horses, mules, rats, mice, dogs, and other wild animals.
Life cycle: The fertilised female slashes the skin of the host with her
until only the last two abdominal segments are exposed. Host skin
 s e a a  le     s
free-living mobile adult male mates with the embedded female. The male
possesses one of the longest intromittent organs relative to body size in the
animal kingdom and mates from an inverted position. The female remains
attached, feeding on host fluids and greatly expanding the size of the
abdomen. The female often expands 8o-fold to reach the size of a pea after
8-10 days. The embedded female produces a nodular swelling leaving
only a small opening to the outside through which up to 200 eggs are
passed and drop to the ground. The eggs hatch in 3 or 4 days, and the fleas
moult through two larval stages. The entire life cycle requires about 17
days.
Geographical distribution: Parts of Africa, Asia and North and South
America. The sand flea, jigger or chigoe, is an important parasite of
humans in the Neotropical and Afrotropical regions.
Pathogenesis: Once T. penetrans becomes engorged with blood, its
ulcers. Tetanus and gangrene may result from secondary infections.
Intense local irritation and pruritus are also symptomatic of more minor
infestations.
Tunga penetrans may also pose significant problems in dogs, particularly
in the interdigital spaces, under the pads and the scrotum, but infestation
tends to be highly localised. The presence of a number of adult T.
penetrans in the paws can be crippling.
The damage to the skin can facilitate the entry of other pathogens leading
to secondary infection and ulceration.
Clinical signs: The presence of the female flea can cause extreme itching,
pain, and inflammation, and secondary infections may occur. This flea
1652
occurs mainly on the feet of humans, causing severe irritation. In pigs the
tolerate the infection with no signs of distress.
Diagnosis: The swelling produced by the female is easily visible and
often surrounded by eggs. The nodule (usually on the foot in humans)
slowly enlarges over a few weeks in a patient who has recently been in an
endemic area. The nodule can range from 4-l0 mm in diameter.
Sometimes, a serosanguinous exudate oozes from the central opening.
Epidemiology: The main habitat is warm, dry soil and sand of beaches,
stables and stock farms. On contact, the fleas invade unprotected skin. The
most common site of involvement is the feet (interdigital skin and
subungual area). The flea has limited jumping ability.
Treatment: Reported topical treatments in humans include cryotherapy Or

with a needle or a forceps. Surgical removal of the fleas is the
recommended treatment. A number of surgical treatment methods are
available.The flea canbe removed fromits cavitywithsterile
instruments, but this is more difficult when the flea is engorged. The
orifice needs to be enlarged, and the entire nodule should be excised. An
antibiotic ointment may be applied, along with systemic antibiotic therapy
when indicated. Aggressive treatment of secondary infection, and tetanus
prophylaxis are important. In dogs, foot- bathing with 0.2% trichlorphon
or metriphonate has been shown to be effective, as has subcutaneous
injection of ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg body weight).

of which blood-feed. The entire egg to adult life cycle may take 2-3
months, but more usually I-2 years.

Feeding may take between 3 and 30 minutes. After engorging, the rostrum
is removed from the host and the bug defecates after which it crawls away
to find shelter.
Geographical distribution: Over 1o0 species are found in South and
Central America, southern and the Midwest USA, predominantly in the
tropical regions. However five species of Linshcosteus are found in India
and seven species of Triatoma are found in southeast Asia and one in
Africa.
Pathogenesis: Triatomines are important vectors of the protozoan
Trypanosoma cruzi. This causes Chagas’ disease in humans and a disease
of similar pathology in dogs. Although cats are susceptible to infection

Clinical signs: The bite causes irritation and swelling. Heavy infestations
in poultry houses may result in chronic blood loss and mortality in young
birds.
Diagnosis: Bugs may be found in cracks and crevices in the housing, or
rarely may be seen on the host.
Pathology: The lesions produced at the feeding site may vary
considerably between individual hosts. The wounds created are usually
seen as erythematous papules or wheals, surrounding the central puncture
site. The wheals may persist for several weeks. Pruritis may be intense,
resulting in secondary traumatic lesions.
Epidemiology: Some species of tratomine bug, including Triatoma

DIPTERA
The Diptera is one of the largest orders in the class [nsecta, with over 120
000 described species. All these species have a complex life cycle with
complete metamorphosis. Hence, the larvae are completely different in
structure and behaviour to the adults. As a result, dipterous flies can be
ectoparasites as larvae or adults, but they are rarely parasites in both life
cycle stages.
LARVALPARASITES:MYIASIS
 q s is o ss o s n jo  an s sis
larval stages of dipterous flies, usually known as maggots or grubs. The
fly larvae feed directly on the host's necrotic or living tissue. The hosts are
usually mammals, occasionally birds and, less commonly, amphibians or
reptiles. All the flies that act as economically important agents of
veterinary myiasis are members of the superfamily Oestroidea. Within this
superfamily there are three major families of myiasis-producing flies:
Oestridae, Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae. Oestridae are highly species
specific and are dealt with in their respective host chapters. Calliphoridae
and Sarcophagidae are generalists and so are dealt with here.
Description: The body of the larval myiasis species is usually clearly
segmented, pointed anteriorly and truncated posteriorly (Fig. 1.29)
1656
However, this shape may be modified, with the larvae of some species
being barrel-like or, occasionally, flattened. The cuticle is typically pale
and soft but is often covered by spines or scales arranged in circular
bands. Although legless, in some species, the body may have a number of
fleshy protuberances, which aid in locomotion. The true head is
completely invaginated into the thorax. The functional mouth is at the
inner end of the pre-oral cavity, from which a pair of darkened
mouth-hooks protrudes. The mouth-hooks are part of a complex structure.
known as the cephalopharyngeal skeleton, to which muscles are attached.
There is a pair of anterior spiracles on the prothoracic segment,
immediately behind the head and a pair of posterior spiracles on the 12th
segment. The structure of the posterior spiracles is of great taxonomic
importance. They usually consist of a pair of sclerotised spiracular plates
with slits or pores in the surface for gaseous exchange.
Life cycle: A small number of species are obligate agents of myiasis -
that is, they require a living host for larval development. Adult females
deposit approximately 200 eggs at a time on the host and the larvae hatch
after 12-24 hours, moult once after 12-18 hours and a second time about
30 hours later. They feed for 3-4 days and then move to the soil to pupate

invaders of myiases on live mammals. The life cycle is identical to the

lethargic, and separate from the herd. They may cease feeding and show
weight loss. Wounds with foul-smelling odour will be observed on
inspection.
Diagnosis: Myiasis is diagnosed by the removal of the larvae and
identification under a dissecting microscope. The larva possess a pair of
oral hooks at the anterior extremity, spiracles on the anterior segment and,
posteriorly, spiracular plates. The arrangement of the mouthparts and
posterior spiracles serve to differentiate the species.However
identification of the larvae of most species is extremely difficult and,
where possible, samples of live larvae should be retained until adult
emergence to confirm the identification, which is more easily
1657
accomplished withthe adult fly.The detailed description  and
identification of the larvae of most species is beyond the scope of this text
and specimens should be referred to a relevant taxonomic specialist.
Pathology: The direct pathological effects of myiasis may vary
considerably and depend on the species of ectoparasite, the number of
larvae and the site of the infestation. In many cases infestation by small
numbers of fly larvae may have little or no discernible clinical effect on
the host. However, a heavier burden of parasites may produce effects
including irritation, discomfort and pruritus, resulting in reduced feeding,
weight loss, reduced fertility and loss of general condition. Ultimately,
heavy infestation may lead rapidly to host death from direct tissue
damage, haemorrhage, bacterial infection, dehydration, anaphylaxis and
toxaemia. Myiasis from a range of species also has been shown to produce
a marked immunological response in the host.
Treatment: For subdermal warble-forming larvae surgical removal of
larvae may be required. Applying heavy oil or petrolatum jelly to the
opening of the lesions will occlude the airway of the larvae and may cause
them to exit the host. Applying a small amount of chloroform or ether to
Lidocaine hydrochloride can also be injected into the furuncular lesion to
facilitate extraction of the larva. Antibiotics should be prescribed. Great
care should be taken during the extraction process to avoid rupturing the
larva in situ.
For cutaneous myiases, the larvae should also be removed and identified
and the wound should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Topical
organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides are effective against newly
hatched larvae, immature forms and adult flies. Larvae inside wounds
must be treated with a suitable larvicide. Spraying or dipping animals with
an approved insecticide and treating infested wounds can protect against
cyromazine and dicyclanil, may give highly effective long-lasting
prophylactic protection against cutaneous myiasis. The macrocyclic
lacotones, ivermectin, eprinomectin, moxidectin and doramectin, may also
be effective against cutaneous myiasis and are particularly effective
against nasopharyngeal, subdermal and gastrointestinal myiases.
Control: Any wounds should be properly dressed to prevent infection. In
1658
dehorning and ear marking should be avoided during the fly season. Given
the high rates of reproduction, high rates of dispersal and multiple
generations per year, area-wide control of most dipterous agents of
myiasis is impractical. There are however, notable exceptions, which will
be highlighted subsequently in this chapter.
Cochliomyia hominivorax
Synonym: Callitroga hominivorax
Common name: Screwworm
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Calliphoridae
Description, adult: The adult fly has a deep greenish blue metallic colour
with a yellow, orange or reddish face and three dark stripes on the dorsal
surface of its thorax.
Description, larvae: Mature larvae measure 15 mm in length and have
bands of spines around the body segments. The tracheal trunks leading
from the posterior spiracles have a dark pigmentation extending forwards
as far as the ninth or tenth segment (Fig. 11.30). This pigmentation is most
conspicuous in fresh specimens.
Hosts: Commonly cattle, pigs and horses but may parasitise any
mammals, including humans.

Life cycle: Cochliomyia hominivorax is an obligate parasite and cannot
complete its life cycle on carrion. Female flies oviposit at the edge of
wounds or in body orifices, in clusters of 150-300 eggs. Shearing,
castration or dehorning wounds are common oviposition sites, as are the
navels of newly born calves. Even wounds the size of a tick bite are
reported to be sufficient to attract oviposition. The flies lay batches of this
size every 2-3 days during adult life, which is on average 7-10 days in
length. The larvae hatch in 10-12 hours and penetrate into the tissues,
which they liquefy, and extend the lesion considerably. The wound may

in 5-7 days, after which they leave the host to pupate in the ground. The
1660
pupal period lasts for between 3 days and several weeks, depending on
temperature. There is no true diapause stage and C. hominivorax cannot
survive over winter in cool temperate habitats. The entire life cycle may
be completed in 24 days in optimum conditions.
Geographical distribution: Cochliomyia hominivorax occur primarily in
tropical areas of southern and central America and the Caribbean islands.
Its range formerly extended north into Mexico and the southern states of
North America, from where it has now been eradicated.
Pathology and pathogenesis: In cattle, infestation initially causes
intermittent irritation and pyrexia, followed by the production of a
cavernous lesion. The tissue shows progressive liquefaction, necrosis and
haemorrhage, before the larvae leave the wound. If untreated, repeated

other blowflies such as Lucilia do not feed in a vertical position or burrow
that extends from the 12th somatic segment to the 10th or 9th segment.
Epidemiology: Adult females have been reported to fly up to 200 miles.
The infestation can also be spread by the transport of animals and people
from infested areas.
Control: As a result of the economic cost of this pest, large-scale
in 1957-59. This was achieved by the release of large numbers of male C.
hominivorax, which had been sterilised by radiation. Sterilised males mate
with wild females, which are in turn rendered infertile. Subsequent control
operations spread the area of sterile male release and by 1980 effective
control of C. hominivorax in the USA was achieved. Despite a number of
sporadic, but significant, outbreaks, effective control has been maintained.
The eradication programme has subsequently been successfully directed
against the fly in Mexico, Puerto Rico and as far as Panama.
Notes: In 1988, C. hominivorax were discovered in an area 10 km south

000km'. In1989 there were about 150 cases of myiasis by C.
hominivorax but by 1990, a total of 12 068 confirmed cases of screwworm
fly myiasis were recorded and, at its peak, almost 3000 cases were seen in
the single month of September 1990. It was estimated that if unchecked
the infestation could cost the Libyan livestock industry about US$30

again using the release of sterile males.

Life cycle: Cochliomyia macellaria is a ubiquitous carrion breeder.
However, it can act as a secondary invader of myiasis, and is known as the
secondary screwworm fly.
Geographical distribution: Neotropical and Nearctic, from Canada to
1662
Pathogenesis:  Mechanical  transmission of disease attributed to this
species includes botulism in birds, 12 different Salmonella types including
Saimonella typhimurium, poliomyelitis and swine influenza.
Epidemiology: Cochliomyia macellaria is often attracted to the wounds
initiated by C. hominivorax. The two species are commonly found
together.
Chrysomya bezziana
Common name: Old World screwworm
Predilection site: Skin wounds
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Calliphoridae
Description, adult: These stout, blue-green flies have four longitudinal
black stripes on the prescutum, orange-brown eyes and a pale coloured
face. The flies have dark legs and white thoracic squamae. The anterior
spiracle is dark orange or black-brown. The adult flies measure 8-10 mm
in length.
Description, larvae: The first-stage larvae are creamy white and measure
about 1.5 mm in length. The second- and third-stage larvae are 4-9 mm
and 18 mm in length respectively, and are similar in appearance; each
segment carrying a broad, encircling belt of strongly developed spines
(Fig. 11.31).

Hosts: Mammals including cattle, sheep, dogs and occasionally humans
Life cycle: Chrysomya bezziana is an obligate agent of myiasis. Gravid
females are attracted to fresh open wounds and body orifices on any
warm-blooded animal. Even small wounds resulting from thorn scratches
and tick bites may be sufficient to attract oviposition. C. bezziana
1664
commonly infest the umbilicus of newborn calves. The female lays
batches of 100-300 eggs on the dry perimeter around the wound. Each
female produces several batches of eggs in her lifetime of about 9 days.
The eggs hatch within 10-20 hours at 37°C and first-stage larvae begin to
feed in the open wound or moist tissue, often penetrating deep into the
hosttissue.
Generally eggs are laid in the late afternoon, ensuring that their
development is complete by the next morning, avoiding lethal exposure to
direct sunlight and drying. The larvae mature in 4-12 days, after which
they drop to the ground to pupate. Pupation lasts for approximately 7 days
month under cooler conditions. Adult C. bezziana may feed on honeydew,
nectar and animal excrement in addition to decomposing corpses. The
entire life cycle takes 2-3 weeks.
Geographical distribution: This species occurs primarily in tropical
areas: Africa and southern Asia including India, the Arabian peninsula,
southeast Asia, the Indonesian and Philippine islands and New Guinea.
irritation and pyrexia, followed by the production of a cavernous lesion.
Infested wounds often have a serosanguineous discharge and sometimes a
distinctive foul-smelling odour. Sometimes, there may be large pockets of
larvae with only small openings in the skin. The tissue shows progressive
liquefaction, necrosis and haemorrhage, before the larvae leave the
wound. Animals may die from secondary infection or toxicity in 1-2
weeks if the infestation is not treated.
Clinical signs: In the first day or two, screwworm infestations are difficult
to detect. Often, all that can be seen is slight motion inside the wound. As
the larvae feed, the wound gradually enlarges and deepens. Animals
infested with screw worms may appear dull, lethargic and separate from
the herd. They may cease feeding and show weight loss. Wounds with
foul-smelling odour will be observed on inspection; however, it may be
difficult to see the maggots at the wound surface because only the
posterior spiracles are exposed. Larvae of other blowflies such as Lucilia
instead feed more superficially. Screwworms may be particularly difficult
to find inside the nasal, anal and vaginal openings.
1665
Screwworms are diagnosed by the removal of the larvae and identification
with a dissecting microscope.
Epidemiology: In temperate regions, screwworm attacks are restricted to
the warm seasons, although may occur during mild winters. In the tropics
they are continuous. Female screwworms are attracted to all
warm-blooded animals. The distance a fly will travel can range from
10-20 km in tropical environments.
Notes: The precise status of Chrysomya bezziana as a clinical and
economic pest is uncertain, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and few
studies have been able to obtain quantitative estimates of myiasis
incidence, its clinical or economic importance. The absence of livestock

Chrysomya megacephala
Common name: Oriental latrine fly
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Calliphoridae
Description, adults: Adults are medium-sized, stout, blue-green flies
with longitudinal stripes on the thorax and orange-brown eyes (Fig
11.32). Chrysomya megacephala can be distinguished from Lucilia by the
broad bands on its rounder abdomen and by its black forelegs. The face is
pale coloured. The anterior spiracle of the thorax of adults is dark
coloured.
Description, larvae: The larvae are about 18 mm in length. They have
hooked mouthparts and bands of small spines on each segment. There are
the last segment only.
1666
Hosts: A range of warm-blooded animals may be infested.
Life cycle: Flies oviposit primarily in carrion but also may act as
secondary invaders of myiases on live mammals. Females lay batches of
The entire egg-to-adult life cycle takes about 8 days at 30°C. Chrysomya
megacephala is commonly called the Oriental latrine fly because of its
habit of breeding in faeces as well on carrion and other decomposing
organic matter. It may occur in large numbers around latrines and may
also become a nuisance in slaughterhouses, confined animal facilities and
open-air meat and fish markets.

Shtakelbergh, 1956).
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. Chrysomya megacephala is a
native of Australasian and Oriental regions. However this species has been
introduced inadvertently into the New World and entered Brazil around
1975. Since then it has dispersed rapidly to reach Central and North
America.
Chrysomya rufifacies
Common name: Hairy maggot blowfly
1667
Predilection site: Skin wounds
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Calliphoridae
Description, adult: These bluish green flies have longitudinal stripes on
the thorax and orange-brown eyes. The hind margins of the abdominal
segments have blackish bands and the anterior spiracle is white or pale
yellow.
Description, larvae: The larvae bear a number of thorn-like, fleshy
projections on most of the body segments, which give these species their
common name of *hairy maggot blowflies'. These projections become
longer on the dorsal and lateral parts of the body. C. rufifacies larvae may
be distinguished from C. albiceps by the presence of small spines on the
stalks of the projections. Third-stage larvae are about 18 mm in length.

Cordylobia anthropophaga
Common name: Tumbu fly
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Calliphoridae
Description, adults: The adult is a stout, yellow-brown fly, 8-12 mm in
length. It has a yellow face and legs and two black marks on the thorax.
Adult flies feed on decaying fruits, carrion and faeces and have large, fully
developed mouthparts. The arista of the antenna has setae on both sides.
The thoracic squamae are without setae and the stem vein of the wing is
without bristles.
Description, larvae: Third-stage larvae are 12-28 mm in length and are
densely, but incompletely, covered with small, backwardly directed,
sinuous slits and a weakly sclerotised peritreme.
Hosts: Humans and other mammals. It is thought that the primary hosts of
 s  si    s  
domestic dog is an important host.
Life cycle: The eggs are deposited singly in dry, sandy, shaded areas
where animals lie, particularly areas contaminated with host urine or
faeces. Females may also be attracted to dry, urine-soiled clothing. Eggs
are laid in early morning or late evening. Up to 500 eggs are laid per
female over their lifespan of 2-3 weeks. The eggs hatch after 2-4 days
and the first-stage larvae wait in the dry substrate for a host. The larvae

through which the larva breathes. The swellings may be found anywhere
on the host animal's body but are most commonly found on ventral parts.
The three larval stages are completed in the host and, when mature (7-15
days after infection), the larvae emerge out of this hole and pupate on the
ground in surface debris. Adult flies emerge from the pupae after 34
weeks.
Geographical distribution: Sub-Saharan Africa
Pathogenesis: The larvae develop under the skin and produce a painful
swelling, 10 mm in diameter, with a small central opening. The swelling is
initially pruritic, becoming more painful as the larva grows. Serous fluid
may exude from the lesion.
Cordylobia rodhaini

are laid in early morning or late evening. Up to 500 eggs are laid per
female over their lifespan of 2-3 weeks. The eggs hatch after 2-4 days,
and the first-stage larvae wait in the dry substrate for a host. The larvae
can remain alive, without feeding, for 9-15 days hidden just beneath the
soil surface. A sudden rise in temperature, vibration or carbon dioxide,
which might signify the presence of a host, activates the larvae. They

Dermatobiahominis
Common name: Torsalo, berne, human bot fly, ura
Predilection site: Skin wounds
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Oestridae
Description, adult: The adult Dermatobia fly resembles Calliphora in
appearance, the short, broad abdomen having a bluish metallic sheen, but
          
measures approximately 12 mm in length. Adults have a yellow-orange
head and legs, and the thorax possesses a sparse covering of short setae.
The arista of the antennae has setae on the outer side only.
Description, larvae: Mature larvae measure up to 25 mm long and are
somewhat oval. They have two to three rows of strong spines on most of
the segments. Larvae are narrowed at the posterior end, particularly the
second-stage larva. The third-stage larva is more oval in shape with
prominent flower-like anterior spiracles (Fig. 1 1.3 7).

Life cycle: Dermatobia is most common in forest and bush regions, the
latter known in many parts of South America as the ‘monte'. The adult
flies do not feed; instead nourishment is derived from food stores
accumulated during the larval stages. The female has a sedentary habit,
resting on leaves until oviposition is imminent, when she catches an insect
(usually a mosquito) and attaches a batch of up to 25 eggs to the underside
of its abdomen or thorax. While attached to this transport host the L1

Wohlfahrtia magnifica
Common name: Flesh fly, screwworm
Predilection site: Skin wounds
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Sarcophagidae
Description, adult: The adult flies are large, measuring 8-14 mm in
length, with elongated bodies. They are grey in colour and have three
distinct, longitudinal, thoracic stripes. The abdomen is clearly marked
with black spots (Fig. 1l.38c). The flies have numerous bristles covering
the body and long, black legs. The arista of the antennae does not possess
setae.
1681
Description, larvae: Larvae possess strongly developed oral hooks
Hosts: Adult females will oviposit on any warmblooded animal. This
includes most livestock, particularly sheep and camels and also poultry,
although cattle, horses, pigs, dogs and humans may also be infested.
Life cycle: Wohifahrtia magnifica is an obligate agent of myiasis. Female
flies deposit 120-170 first-stage larvae on the host, in wounds or next to
body orifices. The larvae feed and mature in 5-7 days, moulting twice,
before leaving the wound and dropping to the ground where they pupate.

Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Sarcophagidae
Description: The adult flies are large, 8-14 mm in length, with elongated
bodies, longitudinal black thoracic stripes and have a grey and black
tessellated abdomen. Larvae possess strongly developed oral hooks.
Hosts: Camels
Life cycle: Wohifahrtia nuba oviposit primarily in carrion, but they may
also act as secondary invaders of myiases on live mammals in north Africa
and the Near East. Females deposit live first-stage larvae rather than eggs.
When fully mature, the third-stage larvae leave the feeding site to pupate
in the ground.
Geographical distribution: Primarily north Africa and the Near East
Pathogenesis: When present in an infected wound or as a secondary
invader at an existing myiasis, larvae extend and deepen the lesion. The
host animal can rapidly lose condition. If untreated, repeated infestation
may quickly lead to the death of the host within1-2 weeks.

Wohlfahrtia meigeni
Common name: Flesh fly
Predilection site: Skin wounds
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Sarcophagidae
Description, adults: The adult flies are large, 8-14 mm in length, with
elongated bodies, longitudinal black thoracic stripes and a grey and black
tessellated abdomen.
Description, larvae: Larvae possess strongly developed oral hooks.
Hosts: Warm-blooded vertebrates, particularly mink and fox, may also
infest rabbits and dogs
Life cycle: The adult female of W. meigeni deposits active maggots on the
host, often in wounds, body orifices or existing myiases. However, the
larvae can penetrate intact skin if it is thin and tender, hence young
animals tend to be most affected. Groups of larvae may be observed in
boil-like swellings under the skin. The larvae feed and grow, moulting
twice, before leaving the host and dropping to the ground where they
pupate.
Geographical distribution: Palearctic, primarily western USA
Pathogenesis: Flies lay their larvae in wounds, body orifices or existing

Description, adults: Adults are grey-black, non-metallic, medium to
large flies with prominent stripes on the thorax and a checkered abdominal
pattern (Fig. 11.38a).
Hosts: Cattle, sheep
Life cycle: All Sarcophagidae are larviporous; the ovulated eggs are
retained within the oviduct of the adult female and batches of 30-200
larvae are deposited shortly after the eggs hatch. The larvae of
Sarcophaga are normally associated with carrion but may occasionally

BITINGANDNUISANCEFLIES
Adult flies may feed on blood, sweat, skin secretions, tears, saliva, urine
or faeces of the domestic animals to which they are attracted. They may
do this either by puncturing the skin directly, in which case they are
known as biting flies, or by scavenging at the surface of the skin, wounds

bites and, therefore, are frequently disturbed by the host while
blood-feeding. As a result, the flies are forced to move from host to host

dramatic escape behaviour, in which self-injury can occur, to less or
increased levels of tail twitching, licking, foot stamping and skin rippling;
animals may bunch or seek the shelter of overhanging vegetation. All
these changes in behaviour result in reduced time spent feeding and
decreased performance. Flies may be observed, often in large numbers,
feeding along the back, sides and ventral abdomen, particularly of cattle
and horses. [rritation and blood loss can lead to a marked reduction in
weight gain.
Diagnosis: Increased levels of disturbance in the host animals;
observation of flies on the animals. Precise identification will require
microscopic examination of specimens. Identification of the larvae of
most species is extremely difficult and, where possible, adults should be
collected or samples of live larvae should be retained until adult
emergence to confirm the identification, which is more easily
accomplished with the adult fly.   The detailed description and
identification of the larvae of most species is beyond the scope of this text
and if identification to species level is required, specimens should be
referred to a relevant taxonomic specialist.
Treatment: Insecticide-impregnated ear tags, tail bands and halters,
mainly containing synthetic pyrethroids, together with pour-on, spot-on
and spray preparations, are widely used to reduce fly annoyance in cattle
andhorses.
1688
Control: Various types of screens and electrocution grids for buildings
are available to reduce fly nuisance, but the best methods of control are
those aimed at improving sanitation and reducing breeding places (source
reduction). For example, in stables and farms manure should be removed.
or stacked in large heaps where the heat of fermentation will kill the
developing stages of flies, as well as eggs and larvae of helminths. [n
addition, insecticides applied to the surface of manure heaps may prove
beneficial.
A range of insecticides and procedures is available for the control of adult
flies. Aerosol space sprays, residual insecticides applied to walls and
ceilings and insecticide-impregnated cards and strips may reduce fly
numbers indoors. Insecticides may also be incorporated in solid or liquid
fly baits, using attractants such as various sugary syrups or hydrolysed
yeast and animal proteins.
numbers of muscid flies associated with fly-worry. These consist of
sacking impregnated with or containing insecticide, which is suspended

However, given the high rates of reproduction, high rates of dispersal and
multiple generations per year, area-wide control of most dipterous agents
of myiasis is impractical.

Pathogenesis: The adult flies feed on the host animal's blood, causing
injury and irritation due to the constant piercing of the skin. Loss of blood
due to horn flies can be considerable. In addition, during feeding the horn
fly withdraws and reinserts its mouthparts many times, resulting in
considerable irritation to the host. Although less important than many
other muscid flies in disease transmission, Haematobia may transmit
Stephanofilaria, the skin filarioid of cattle.
Epidemiology: Hot, humid weather, with a temperature of 23-27°C and a
relative humidity of 65-90%, is ideal for horn fly activity. The flies may
be more abundant on cattle with dark coats and dark-coloured areas of
bicoloured cattle. When temperatures are above 29°C flies migrate to the
shaded skin of the belly and udder.

it has been concluded that they are probably best regarded as subspecies of
H. irritans.
Haematobia minuta
Synonym: Lyperosia minuta
Predilection site: Skin, withers, back and sides. Occasionally the belly in

Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Description: The adults are up to 4 mm in length. They are usually grey,
often with several dark stripes on the thorax. Unlike Musca the proboscis
is held forwards, and unlike Stomoxys the palps are stout and as long as
the proboscis.

adequate moisture and temperatures. Low temperatures and dry conditions
delay larval development and kill the eggs. After pupation in the ground,
the newly emerged adult flies seek out and then remain on their cattle or
buffalo hosts. Reproduction is continuous and populations are
multivoltine.
Geographical distribution: Africa
Pathogenesis: Large numbers cause intense irritation, and the skin
wounds made during  feeding may attract other muscids and
myiasis-producing flies. These flies may have a pronounced effect on the
health and productivity of the cattle. Significant blood loss can occur due
to the high densities on the host (often several thousand) and also the fact
that both sexes feed several times per day. The bites are painful and
irritating and may cause feeding lesions. It is difficult to assess the precise
economic effect of these flies, but their effective control on grazing cattle
can result in significant increases in production. Although less important
than many other muscid flies in disease transmission, species of
Haematobia transmit Stephanofilaria, the skin filarioid of cattle and, in
some areas, camel trypanosomiasis.
Haematobia stimulans
Synonym:Haematobosca stimulans
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Description, adult: Haematobia stimulans are slightly smaller than
Stomoxys caicitrans at about 6 mm in length. They are usually grey, often
with several dark stripes on the thorax. The proboscis is held forwards
and, unlike Stomoxys, the palps are stout, as long as the proboscis and are
club-shaped apically (Fig. 11 .40b). In H. stimuians the palps are yellow in
colour, whereas in H. irritans they are dark grey. The eggs are reddish
brown and lack a terminal horn.

Hosts: Cattle
Life cycle: Haematobia stimuians is less resident on its host than H.
irritans, and more closely resembles S. cafcitrans in its behaviour. The
eggs are 1-1.5 mm in length and are laid in fresh faeces. Females require
300-400 eggs that are deposited in batches of 20-30. These hatch quickly

Geographical distribution: Europe
Pathogenesis: The bites are painful and irritating and may cause feeding
lesions. Although less important than many other muscid flies in disease
transmission, species of Haematobia transmit Stephanofilaria, the skin
filarioid of cattle.
Hydrotaea irritans
Common name: Sheep headfly
Predilection site: Skin wounds
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Description: Hydrotaea irritans is generally similar in size  and
olive-green abdomen and an orange-yellow coloration at the base of the
wings. The thorax is black with grey patches. Adults measure 4-7 mm in
length. Specific identification of non-biting muscid flies requires specialist
advice.
Hosts: Cattle, sheep and horses
Life cycle: Adult flies prefer still conditions and are found near
woodlands and plantations, with peak numbers occurring in mid-summer.
1694
Eggs are laid in decaying vegetation or faeces; they hatch and develop into
mature larvae by the autumn. Each female produces one or two batches of
about 30 eggs in its lifetime. Third-stage larvae may be predatory on other

numbers occurring in mid-summer.
Geographical distribution: Widespread throughout northern Europe, but
not believed to be present in North America.
Pathogenesis: Headflies are attracted to animals and feed on tears, saliva,
 s    ao s s '  
mouthparts are adapted for feeding on liquids, but in addition they possess
small teeth and the rasping effect of these during feeding leads to skin
damage. They are facultative blood-feeders and will ingest blood at the
edges of wounds if available. Horned breeds of sheep, such as the
Swaledale and Scottish Blackface, are most susceptible to attack (Fig.
11.41). Swarms of these flies around the head lead to intense irritation and
annoyance and result in self-inflicted wounds, which then attract more
flies. Clusters of flies feeding at the base of the horns lead to extension of
these wounds, and the condition may be confused with blowfly myiasis.
Secondary bacterial infection of wounds is common, which may
encourage blowfly strike. The economic losses due to headfly infection

Epidemiology: Although commonly known as the sheep headfly, this
species may be the most numerous muscid species found on cattle and
horses. The populations of Hydrotaea irritans peak during midsummer.
Adult flies prefer still conditions and are associated with permanent, fairly
sheltered pastures that border woodlands or plantations.

Musca autumnalis
Common name: Facefly
Predilection site: Skin, especially eyes, nose and mouth
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Description: Female adults of Musca autumnalis are 6-8 mm in length,
male adults 5-6 mm, and they vary in colour from light to dark grey. The
thorax is usually grey with four dark longitudinal stripes, and there is a
sharp upward bend in the fourth longitudinal wing vein. The abdomen is a
yellowish brown background colour with a black median longitudinal
stripe. The eyes are reddish and the space between them can be used to
determine the sex of a specimen, since in females it is almost twice as
broad as in males. The aristae are bilaterally plumose at the tip. The
facefly, M. autumnalis, is very similar to M. domestica in size and
appearance, although the abdomen of the female is darker, while in the
 male tergite two and three are typically yellowish orange along the sides.
The detailed wing venation  is of  taxonomic importance  in the
differentiation of Musca from similar flies belonging to other genera such
as Fannia, Morellia and Muscina and in the identification of different
1696
Musca species, but is beyond the scope of this text. The eggs of M.
Hosts: Cattle
Life cycle: The facefly, Musca autumnalis, congregates in large numbers
around the faces of cattle. It feeds on secretions from the eyes, nose and
mouth as well as from blood in wounds left by other flies, such as
tabanids. It lays its eggs just beneath the surface of fresh cattle manure
autumnalis are about 3 mm in length and possess a short respiratory stalk.
They are arranged so that the respiratory stalk of each egg projects above
the surface of the pat. Like M. domestica, the larvae pass throughout three
stages within approximately l week, before entering the surrounding soil
and pupariating to form a whitish coloured puparium. Summer generations
require about 2 weeks to complete a life cycle. This allows several
generations in any one season. Faceflies prefer bright sunshine and usually
do not follow cattle into barns or heavy shade. Adults are strong fliers and
can move between widely separated herds. Faceflies overwinter as adults.
in response to short photoperiods, aggregating in overwintering sites such
as farmbuildings.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide. Musca autumnalis is widely
distributed throughout Europe, central Asia and parts of Africa and, since
its introduction in the 1950s, can now be found throughout North
America.

considered to be important in the transmission of infectious bovine
keratoconjunctivitis ('pink eye’ or New Forest disease) due to Moraxella
bovis, and they are also intermediate hosts of Parafilaria bovicola. Adults
are developmental hosts for Thelazia (nematodes which live in the
conjunctival sac of cattle and horses, causing conjunctivitis, keratitis,
photophobia and epiphora).
Epidemiology: In northern Europe, Musca autumnalis may often be the
most numerous fly worrying cattle in pasture. The eggs of M. autumnalis
are usually laid in bovine faeces, and if conditions are suitable the
1697
to bunching and so interfere with grazing, contributing to reduced
production rates.
Notes: Musca autumnalis is one of the most important livestock pests to
invade North America. Its introduction from Europe was first detected in
1951 in Nova Scotia. From there it spread southward and, by 1959, many
cases were being reported on cattle. It now occurs throughout
cattle-rearing areas of the USA and Canada.
Musca domestica
Common name:Housefly
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Distribution: Worldwide
Description: Female adults of Musca domestica are 6-8 mm in length,
male adults 5-6 mm, and they vary in colour from light to dark grey. The
thorax is usually grey with four dark longitudinal stripes, and there is a
sharp upward bend in the fourth longitudinal wing vein (Fig. 1l.42). The
abdomen has a yellow-brown background colour with a black median
longitudinal stripe. The eyes are reddish and the space between them can
be used to determine the sex of a specimen, since in females it is almost
twice as broad as in males. The aristae are bilaterally plumose at the tip.
The detailed wing venation is of taxonomic importance in the
differentiation of Musca from similar flies belonging to other genera such
as Fannia, Morellia and Muscina and in the identification of different
Musca species, but is beyond the scope of this text.

Hosts: Although Musca domestica is not itself a parasite of living
animals, it is responsible for the transmission of a variety of important
diseases and parasites, particularly to humans and a wide variety of
domestic animals.
Life cycle: Female flies lay batches of up to 150 creamy white, 1.0 mm
long, banana-shaped eggs in wet faeces or rotting organic material. The
dorsal surface of the eggs has two curved, rib-like thickenings. Batches of
eggs are laid at 3-4-day intervals throughout life. The eggs hatch (under

High manure moisture favours their survival. At the posterior end of the
larvae there are paired respiratory spiracles, the shape and structure of
feed on decomposing organic material and mature to 10-15 cm in length
in 3-7 days under suitable conditions. Optimal temperatures for larval
development are 30-37°C, although as the larvae mature their temperature
tolerance increases. Mature larvae then move to drier areas around the
larval habitat and pupate, forming a rigid and dark brown barrel-shaped

organic material. Pathogens are either carried on the hairs of the feet and
body or regurgitated as salivary vomit during subsequent feeding. A
number of Musca spp. have been incriminated in the spread of diseases
including mastitis, conjunctivitis and anthrax. In humans they are
probably most important in the dissemination of Shigella and other enteric
bacteria. Eggs of various helminths may be carried by the flies, and they
also may act as intermediate hosts of a number of helminths such as
Habronema spp and Raillietina spp. Deposition of Habronema larvae in
wounds may give rise to skin lesions commonly termed 'summer sores’ in
horses. The housefly, Musca domestica, is closely associated with
humans, livestock, their buildings and organic wastes. Although it may be
of only minor direct annoyance to animals, its potential for transmission of
viral and bacterial diseases and protozoan and metazoan parasites is of
significance.

Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Distribution: In Africa, the Pacific islands and Oriental regions
Pathogenesis: Musca sorbens is a widespread species, largely replacing
M. domestica where it occurs and is an important vector of disease in
these regions(see M.domestica)
Musca vetustissima
Common name: Bush fly
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Distribution: Australia
Pathogenesis: The bush fly, Musca vetustissima, which is very closely
related to M. sorbens, is an important nuisance pest of humans and
livestock. Bushflies have been known to transmit eye infections and other
enteric diseases between other animals and humans.
Musca crassirostris
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Description: Musca crassirostris are not obligatory parasites, but they can
feed on a wide variety of animal secretions and are especially attracted to
wounds. Adults are about 5.5-7.5 mm in length and vary in colour from
light to dark grey. There are four distinct dark longitudinal stripes on the

Geographical distribution: Mediterranean countries
Pathogenesis: M. crassirostris may use the prestomal teeth to rasp the
skin and draw blood, which is then ingested. This species may act as a
mechanical vector for a wide variety of viral and bacterial diseases and
protozoan and metazoan parasites (see M. domestica).
Stomoxys calcitrans
Common name: Stable fly
Predilection site: Skin. Location depends on the host: on cattle the legs
are preferred, on dogs the ears
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Muscidae
Description, adults: Superficially, Stomoxys caicitrans resembles the
housefly M. domestica, being similar in size (about 7-8 mm in length) and
grey with four longitudinal dark stripes on the thorax. Its abdomen,
however, is shorter and broader than M. domestica with three dark spots
on the second and third abdominal segments. Probably the simplest
method of distinguishing stable flies from M. domestica and other genera
Of non-biting muscid flies is by examination of the proboscis, which in
Stomoxys is conspicuous and forward projecting (Fig. 11.40). When
feding, the proboscis swings downwards and skin penetration is achieved
by the rasping action of fine teeth on the end of the labium. Stable flies
can be distinguished from biting muscid flies of the genus Haematobia by
the larger size and the much shorter palps of the former.
Description, larvae: Larvae of Stomoxys can be identified by examination
of the posterior spiracles, which are relatively well separated and each has
three S-shaped slits.

Life cycle: Both male and female flies feed on blood. The female lays

complete darkness and a temperature of about 27°C. The puparia are
brown and about 6 mm in length. The complete life cycle from egg to
adult fly may take 12-60 days depending mainly on temperature.
After emergence the adult females require several blood-meals before the

reactions with an immunosuppressive effect, rendering the host more
susceptible to disease.
Stable flies may probe and attempt to feed on a number of hosts in rapid
succession. They may therefore act as important mechanical vectors in the
transmission of pathogens such as trypanosomes. Trypanosoma evansi
(causing surra of equines and dogs), T. equinum (mal de caderas of
equines, cattle, sheep and goats), T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense (human
African trypanosomiasis) and T. brucei and T. vivax (nagana of equines.
cattle, sheep and goats) are all mechanically transmitted by S. caicitrans.
These flies also act as vectors for anthrax and Dermatophilus congolensis.
S. calcitrans also serves as an intermediate host of the nematode
Habronema.
1703
Epidemiology: Approximately 3 minutes is required for a blood-meal
during which time flies may almost double in weight. The bite of stable
flies is painful and as such they are a serious pest of animals. In large
numbers these flies are a great source of annoyance to grazing cattle and
in some areas there are estimates of milk and meat production losses of up
to 20%. Adult flies live for about 1 month and are abundant around farm
buildings and stables in late summer and autumn in temperate areas. They
largely remain in areas of strong sunlight and they bite mainly out of
doors, although they will follow animals inside to feed. They will also
enter buildings during rainy weather in the autumn. S. caicitrans are swift
fliers but in general do not travel long distances.
Fannia canicularis
Common name: Lesser housefly
Predilection site: Skin, mouth, nose, eyes
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Faniidae
Description, adult: Species of Fannia generally resemble houseflies in
appearance but are more slender and smaller at about 4-6 mm in length.
The fourth longitudinal vein is straight (not bent as in the house fly) (Fig.
11.43a). Fannia canicularis is greyish to almost black in colour,
possessing three dark longitudinal stripes on the dorsal thorax. The palps
are black_ The aristae are bare.
Description, larvae: The larvae are easily recognised by the flattened
shape and the branched, fleshy projections from the body (Fig. 11.43b).
The brown-coloured puparium resembles the larva in shape.
Hosts: Cattle, poultry
Life cycle: Fannia breed in a wide range of decomposing organic
material, particularly the excrement of chickens, humans, horses and
cows. The life cycle is typical, with three larvae stages, followed by the
pupa and adult. The complete life cycle requires from 15-30 days.

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Species of Fannia are of interest as nuisance pests of
cattle-confinement areas and dairies. They rarely feed directly from
animals; however, the few that do are attracted to smeared faeces, sweat,
and mucus. Although it may be of only minor direct annoyance to
animals, its potential for transmission of viral and bacterial diseases and
protozoan and metazoan parasites is of significance, as for Musca
domestica.
Epidemiology: Flies may be observed feeding on animal faeces, manure
piles, garbage and other types of decomposing organic material, and seen
attempting to land and feed on the liquid secretions of exudates of the
eyes, nose and mouth. Fannia canicularis is the most cosmopolitan
species and is commonly found breeding in animal manure and confined
livestockfacilities
1705
In contrast to Musca domestica, the eggs and larvae of most species of
Fannia are more susceptible to desiccation. Hence, they are more
abundant in semiliquid sites, especially pools of semi-liquid faeces. Adults
are more abundant in the cooler months of spring and autumn, declining in
midsummer. Adults of Fannia are readily attracted into buildings and
adult males are familiar as the flies responsible for the regular triangular
flight paths beneath light bulbs or shafts of sunlight from windows in
buildings.

TABANIDS:HORSEFLIES
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Tabanidae
Hosts: Generally large domestic or wild animals and man, but small
mammals and birds may also be attacked.
Description, adults: These are medium to large biting flies, up to 25 mm
in length, with wingspans of up to 65 mm. The head is large and the
         s
various stripes or patches of colour on the abdomen or thorax and even the
large eyes, which are dichoptic in the female and holoptic in the male,
may be coloured. The coloration of the wings and the short, stout,
threesegmented antennae, which have no arista, are useful in
differentiating the three major genera of Tabanidae (Fig. 11.45).
1710
The mouthparts, which are adapted for slashing/sponging, are short and
strong and always point downwards. Most prominent is the stout labium,
which is grooved dorsally to take the other mouthparts, collectively
termed the biting fascicle. The labium is also expanded terminally as
paired large labella, which carry tubes called pseudotracheae, through
which blood or fluid from wounds is aspirated. The biting fascicle, which
creates the wound, consists of six elements, the upper sharp labrum, the
hypopharynx with its salivary duct, paired rasp-like maxillae and paired
broad pointed mandibles. Male flies have no mandibles and therefore
cannot feed on blood. They instead feed on honeydew and the juice of
flowers.
Description, larvae: These are spindle-shaped and off-white in colour
and clearly segmented. The cuticle has distinct longitudinal striations.
Mature larvae may be 15-30 mm in length. There is a distinct head
capsule and strong biting mandibles. Abdominal segments have
unsegmented leg-like structures (pseudopods) for locomotion (four pairs
in Tabanus and three pairs in Chrysops). A distinct posterior respiratory
siphon is usually present, which may be greatly elongated.

Life cycle: After a blood meal the female lays batches of 100-1000
creamy white 0r greyish cigar-shaped eggs, 1.0-2.5 mm long, on the
underside of vegetation or on stones, generally in muddy or marshy areas.
The eggs hatch in l-2 weeks, using a special spine to exit the egg case,
and the cylindrical, poorly differentiated larvae drop into the mud or
water. The larvae are 1.0-60 mm in length, and have 11 segments. They
are recognised as tabanids by their small black retractable heads and the
  o  s     
pseudopods. They also have a structure in the last segment, unique to
tabanid larvae, known as Graber's organ, the function of which may be
sensory. They are sluggish and feed either by scavenging on decaying
organic matter or by predation on small arthropods including other tabanid
larvae. Optimally, larval development takes 3 months, but, if
Overwintering occurs, may extend for up to 3 years. The subcylindrical
pupa is brown, the abdominal segments are movable and the anterior part
of the appendages of the adult can be distinguished. Mature larvae pupate
while partially buried in mud or soil and the adult fly emerges after 1-3
1712
weeks. In most species, males complete their pupation before females.
After emergence the male pursues the female and mating, initiated in the
air, is completed on the ground. Adults are strong fliers and are usually
diurnal. The whole life cycle takes a minimum of 45 months or longer if
larval development is prolonged.
Populations of adult flies show seasonal fluctuations in both temperate and
tropical areas. In temperate climates adults die in the autumn and are
replaced by new populations the following spring and summer, whereas in
tropical areas their numbers are merely reduced during the dry season with
an increase at the start of the rainy season.

(the major food source of males who lack mandibles). They typically bite
a number of times in different places before they are replete and the
wounds created continue to bleed and may attract other flies. Adults feed
approximately every 3 hours during the day and between feeding rest on
the underside of leaves or on stones or trees.
Tabanusspp
Common name: Horseflies
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Tabanidae
Description: Species of the genus Tabanus have transparent wings. Also
useful in generic differentiation are the characteristics of short, stout.
three-segmented antennae, which have no arista. In species of the genus
Tabanus the first two antennal segments are small and the terminal
segment has a tooth-like projection on its basal part and four annulations
(Fig. 11.45).
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: The adult females locate their prey mainly by sight and
their bites are deep and painful. They feed every 3-4 days causing a great
deal of annoyance. The pain caused by their bites leads to interrupted
1713
feeding, and as a consequence flies may feed on a succession of hosts.
They are therefore important in the mechanical transmission of a range of
pathogens such as anthrax, pasteurellosis, trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis
and the human filarial disease, loaosis.
Epidemiology: These powerful flies may disperse many kilometres from
their breeding areas and are most active during hot, sunny days.
Notes: In North America in particular, several species of the genus
Tabanus are particularly important pests. These are Tabanus atratus (the
black horse fly), Tabanus fineola and Tabanus similis in the eastern states.
In the western USA, Tabanus punctifer and Tabanus suicifrons are of
particular importance. Other common species are Tabanus quinquevittatus
and Tabanus nigrovittatus, which are well known in North America as
'greenheads'.
Chrysops spp
Common name:Horseflies,deerflies
Predilection site: Preferred feeding sites are the underside of the
abdomen, the legs, neck and withers.
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Tabanidae
Description: Chrysops have dark banded wings, which are divergent
when at rest. The wing venation is characteristic, especially the branching
of the fourth-longitudinal vein (Fig. 1l.45).
Geographical distribution: Worldwide, primarily in the Holarctic and
Oriental regions

vector of Pasteureffa tufarensis in North America.C. dimidiata,the
mango fly, and C. siacea are intermediate hosts of the filariid nematode,
evansi, the causative agent of surra in equines and dogs; T. equinum the
cause of mal de Caderas of equines; T. simiae of pigs; T. vivax and T.
brucei which cause nagana of equines, cattle, sheep and other ungulates;
1714
and T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense which cause human African
trypanosomiasis.
Haematopota spp
Common name: Horseflies, clegs
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Tabanidae
Description: Haematopota have characteristically mottled wings that are
held divergent when at rest. In Haematopota the first antennal segment is
large and the second segment narrower, while the terminal segment has
three annulations (Fig. 11.45).
Geographical distribution:  Worldwide, although there are no
Haematopota species in Australia. There are five species of Haematopota
in the Nearctic region; Haematopota americana is of the greatest
veterinary importance in America and H. pluvialis in Europe.
Pathogenesis: Haematopota species may feed on a number of hosts in
rapid succession. They may therefore act as important mechanical vectors
in the transmission of pathogens such as anthrax, pasteurellosis,
trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis and the human filarial disease, loaosis.
Epidemiology: These powerful flies may disperse many kilometres from
their breeding areas and are most active during hot, sunny days.
TSETSEFLIES
Glossina spp
Common name: Tsetse flies
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Glossinidae
1715
Description: In general, adult tsetse are narrow, yellow to dark brown
flies, 6-15 mm in length, and have a long, rigid, forward-projecting
proboscis (Fig. 1l.46). There are 23 known species. When at rest, the
wings are held over the abdomen like a closed pair of scissors. The thorax
is a dull greenish brown colour and is marked with inconspicuous stripes
and spots. The abdomen is brown, with six segments that are visible form
the dorsal aspect (Fig. 11.47). Tsetse flies are easily distinguished from all
other flies by the characteristic hatchet-shaped medial cell in the wings.
The antenna has a large third segment, with an arista that bears 17-29
dorsal branchinghairs.

1717
There are no maxillae or mandibles in the mouth-parts of tsetse flies and
the long proboscis is adapted for piercing and sucking. The proboscis is
composed of a lower U-shaped labium with rasp-like labella terminally
and an upper narrower labrum, which together create a food channel.
Within this food channel sits the slender hypopharynx that carries saliva
and anticoagulant down into the wound formed during feeding. The
proboscis is held horizontally between long palps, which are of an even
thickness throughout.
The 23 known species of tsetse flies can be divided into three groups, each
with different habits and requirements. The Glossina palpalis group are
riverine species, which feed primarily on reptiles and ungulates. Flies of
the G. morsitans group are savannah and dry thorn-bush species, which
feed mainly on large animals. Members of the G. fusca group occur in the
rainforest, preferring dense shade and riverine thickets.
Hosts: Various mammals, reptiles and birds
1718
Life cycle: Both male and female flies suck blood and although the
various species of tsetse may have some host preferences, generally they
will feed on a wide variety of animals.
The females, in contrast to other muscids, are viviparous. They ovulate a
single egg at a time. The fertilised egg is retained in the oviduct, where it
hatches after about 4 days at 25°C. The larva is retained in the common
oviduct (uterus) where it is nourished with secretions from the highly
specialised accessory glands. Maturation in the uterus from fertilised egg
to the mobile, 8.0-10 mm long, third-stage larva takes approximately 10
days. At this stage the larva is creamy white, segmented and posteriorly
has a pair of prominent dark ear-shaped protuberances known as
polypneustic lobes. During the development of the third-stage larva these
lobes protrude from the posterior abdomen of the adult female and have a
respiratory function similar to the posterior spiracles of other muscid
larvae.
When mature, the larva is deposited on to the ground by the adult female,
usually into characteristic areas of bare, sandy soil under shade. After
deposition the larva wriggles into loose soil to a depth of a few
centimetres and forms a rigid dark brown, barrel-shaped puparium within
12 hours. The pupal period is relatively long, taking 4-5 weeks, 0r even
more in cool weather. On emergence the adult is unable to fly until its
wings have expanded. It takes at least a week for the complete endocuticle
to be secreted and for the exocuticle to harden fully. The female fly may
require several blood meals over a period of 16-20 days before producing
her first larva. Once fully active the adult flies feed every 2-3 days and the
first larviposition occurs 9--12 days after emergence.
Breeding generally continues throughout the year, with peak fly numbers
occurring at the end of the rainy season. The longevity of adult flies in
nature is variable, ranging from a few days to several months.
Geographical distribution: These flies are confined to a belt of tropical
           
Zimbabwe and Mozambique in the south (Lat. 20-30°S). The various
species are restricted to different geographical areas according to habitat.

during feeding and these then undergo multiplication and maturation

Clinical signs: Host animals may scratch and rub bite wound sites, which
may result in significant skin trauma.
The   symptoms   of  tsetse-transmitted  trypanosomiasis  include
hyperthermia, anaemia, rapid emaciation, oedema of the lower parts of the
s lesu  s e p s x pn u
Paralysis may also occur.
Diagnosis: Observation and identification of the adult flies feeding on the
host animal. The flies are most active at dawn and dusk.
Epidemiology: The normal hosts of tsetse flies are African wild, large
mammals and reptiles, which experience few or no ill effects from the
presence of the trypanosomes in their blood unless subject to stresses such
as starvation. These wild animals act as reservoirs of the disease. When
humans or domestic animals become infected, however, the pathogenic
effects of the trypanosomes can be debilitating or fatal unless treated.
Treatment: Dipping cattle in pyrethroid insecticides such as deltamethrin
  s  e    
used to treat trypanosome infection.
Control: In the past, campaigns against tsetse flies to control
trypanosomiasis both in humans and in animals depended mainly on
large-scale killing of the game animals that act as reservoirs of
trypanosome infection and as a source of blood for the flies. It was also
common to clear large areas of bush in order to destroy the habitats of the
adult flies. These methods were fairly successful, but are now largely
unacceptable on ecological and economic grounds.
Currently, most anti-tsetse measures rely on the use of insecticides applied
from the ground or by aircraft. When the objective is complete eradication
of Glossina, residual formulations of insecticides are used. It is also
essential that the area to be sprayed has economic potential and that
agricultural  development   of  the  cleared   area   should  proceed
because of the relatively low rate of tsetse reproduction but, because of the
1720
inevitable reinvasion of tsetse from surrounding untreated areas, is
uneconomic unless the selected area is on the edge of a tsetse belt where
the fly populationis already under stress because of relatively
unfavourable climatic conditions. Advocates of insecticidal spraying argue
that, since Gfossina is highly susceptible to the insecticides used, the
sophisticated and selective use of modern chemicals, usually on one
occasion only, has no major and permanent effects on the environment. [n
 s s m   i s  n io od  o
successful control are much more significant in this respect.
Populations of tsetse flies have been reduced or eradicated in localised
areas by the use of traps. These have the advantages of being cheap, can
be used by local labour and are harmless to the environment. Essentially
they depend on the presentation of a material, such as dark cloth, which
attracts the flies and leads into a trap that often incorporates an insecticide.
Volatile chemical odours, such as acetone octenol or cattle urine, placed in
 or near traps attract flies and increase the number caught. However, traps
are relatively difficult to deploy and maintain in densely vegetated areas
of bush.
Some breeds of domestic livestock such as N'dama cattle are relatively
trypanotolerant.
G. austeni, G. fuscipes and G. tachinoides while key species in the
morsitans group include G. morsitans and G. palidipes.
CULICIDAE: MOSQUITOES
The mosquitoes, family Culicidae, are a diverse group of over 3000
species. They occur worldwide from the tropics to the arctic. There are
three genera of medical and veterinary importance: these are Anopheles,
Aedes and Cuiex. There are about 900 species in the genus Aedes.
Common name: Mosquito
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Culicidae
1721
Description: Mosquitoes vary from 2-10 mm in length and have slender
bodies, prominent eyes and long legs (Fig. 11.48). The long, narrow wings
are held crossed flat over the abdomen at rest and bear scales, which

conspicuous, forward-projecting, elongated proboscis adapted for piercing
and sucking. Individual elements comprise a long, U-shaped, fleshy
labium containing paired maxillae, mandibles and a hypopharynx, which
carries a salivary duct that delivers anticoagulant into the host's tissues
(Fig. 1.25). The labrum forms the roof of the proboscis. All the elements,
with the exception of the labium, enter the skin during feeding by the
females, forming a tube through which blood is sucked. In the
non-parasitic males the maxillae and mandibles are reduced or absent. The
maxillary palps of different species are variable in length and morphology.

Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Life cycle: The larvae of all species are aquatic and occur in a wide
variety of habitats, ranging from extensive areas such as marshes to
smaller areas; the edge of permanent pools, marshes, puddles, flooded
(Fig. 1l.49). However, they are usually absent from large tracts of
uninterrupted water, such as lakes, and from fast-flowing streams or
rivers. Mosquito larvae are known as wrigglers and require between 3 and
20 days to pass through four stadia. Hatching is temperature-dependent
and occurs after several days or weeks, but in some temperate species
eggs may overwinter. All four larval stages are aquatic. There is a distinct
head with one pair of antennae, compound eyes and prominent mouth

transparent and the eyes, legs and other structures of the developing adult
are readily visible. The tapering abdominal segments have short hairs, and
1722
terminally there is a pair of oval, paddle-like extensions, which enable the
pupa to move up and down in the water. Generally the pupal stage is
short; only a few days in the tropics and several weeks or longer in
temperate regions. The adult emerges through a dorsal split in the pupal
tegument. Adults usually only fly up to a few hundred metres from their
breeding sites, but may be dispersed long distances by winds. Although
the lifespan of adult flies is generally short, some species can overwinter

normal activity and flight, mosquitoes feed on nectar and plant juices, but
females are anautogenous; they need an initial blood-meal to develop their
mosquito will live for an average of 2-3 weeks, while the male's lifespan
is shorter.
Mosquitoes are nocturnal or crepuscular feeders with a wide host range.
Host selection is extremely opportunistic and is largely influenced by the
relative abundance of hosts found in the habitat. Host location is achieved
using a range of olfactory and visual cues, orientation to wind direction
and body warmth. Oviposition begins as soon as a suitable site is located.
Adult mosquitoes are strong fliers.
       
Mosquito populations can reach large sizes, especially in parts of the
southern USA, and the persistent feeding activity of adult females may
cause considerable nuisance and reduce the productivity of livestock
1724
Females preferentially feed on large mammals and are so persistent that
livestock will be driven away from areas where they are numerous.
Sensitivity to mosquito bites varies with individuals; most hosts will suffer
only a minor reaction, showing local swelling, redness and irritation.
Other hosts can exhibit severe hypersensitivity reactions to mosquito
saliva and, if the bites are scratched, a secondary bacterial infection may
ensue.
Epidemiology: In temperate climates the population size peaks during the
summer, while in tropical countries large populations are usually present
all year round.
Clinical signs: The bite of mosquitoes may cause a localised
inflammatory reaction with intense itching. Sensitivity to mosquito bites
varies with individuals; most hosts will suffer only a minor reaction,
showing local swelling, redness and irritation. Other hosts can exhibit

Diagnosis: The bite appears as a reddened, raised area on the skin.

time as short-acting space sprays, some are now being developed as
residual  insecticides.  Insecticides  with a residual action are effective
against  the adult  stages,  particularly  if  applied  indoors.
purpose.
Control: Measures, largely developed for the control of human malaria,
are directed either against the developing larvae or adults, or against both
simultaneously. The various measures used against larvae include the
removal or reduction of available breeding sites by drainage or other
means, which makes these sites unsuitable for larval development. This is
not always practicable, economical or acceptable and the feasibility of
these methods must always be assessed locally. Biological control has
areas and rice fields, but these methods are unsuitable for those mosquito
species breeding in small temporary collections of water. The isolation
and development of mosquito pathogens including microorganisms,
 protozoa and nematodes is mainly experimental at present, as are genetic
methods of control.
1725
Probably the most widely used measures against mosquito larvae are those
which involve the repeated application of toxic chemicals, mineral oils or
insecticides to breeding sites, but these have to be continuously applied

Aedesspp
Common name: Mosquito
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Culicidae
Sub-family: Culicinae
Description: The genus Aedes belongs to the subfamily Culicinae. The
culicine adult rests with its body angled and its abdomen directed towards
the surface (Fig. 1l.50). The palps of female culicine mosquitoes are
usually only about one quarter of the length of the proboscis.
Hosts: A wide variety of mammals (including humans), reptiles and birds
Life cycle: After a blood meal the gravid female lays up to 300 eggs
singly on the surface of water. The eggs are dark coloured, either elongate
or ovoid, and cannot survive desiccation. Most species of Aedes lay their
eggs on moist substrates rather than on the water itself, where they mature
and await adequate water to stimulate hatching. In some cases the eggs

by Plasmodium. Mosquitoes can act as vectors of various viral diseases,
including arboviruses, such as equine encephalitis (a togavirus), rabbit
transmit yellow fever and the human filarial nematodes, Wuchereria and
Brugia.
Species of importance: Aedes sierrensis is one of the main carriers of
Dirofilaria immitis and will attack mammals of all sizes. A particularly
important  aggressive  biting species  is  Aedes vigilex. Aedes

Description: Living anopheline adults can readily be distinguished from
culicines, such as Aedes and Cuiex, when resting on a flat surface. On
landing, anopheline mosquitoes rest with the proboscis, head, thorax and
 (o ll a) as a o a ue e a s ao i ua
palps of female anopheline mosquitoes are as long and straight as the
proboscis. The abdomen of Anopheles bears hairs but not scales.
Life cycle: The eggs are dark coloured, boat-shaped, and possess
characteristic lateral floats that prevent them from sinking and maintain
their orientation in the water. Such eggs usually hatch within 2 or 3 days
and cannot survive desiccation. Most larvae of Anopheles lie parallel to
the water surface and take in air through a pair of spiracles on the
penultimate abdominal segment.
1728
Pathogenesis: Species of Anopheles transmit the dog heartworm,
Dirofilaria immitis. Mosquitoes are also important in the transmission of
the  arboviruses (arthropod-borne) causing eastern,  western and
Venezuelan encephalitis in horses and other arbovirus diseases of man and
animals. The genus Anopheles contains the only known vectors of human
malaria, and transmits the human filarial nematodes, Wuchereria and
Brugia.
Culexspp
Common name: Mosquitoes
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Culicidae
Sub-family: Culicinae
Description: The genus Culex belongs to the subfamily Culicinae. The
culicine adult rests with its body angled and its abdomen directed towards
the surface (Fig. 1l.50). The palps of female culicine mosquitoes are
usually only about one quarter of the length of the proboscis.
Life cycle: In species of the genus Culex, eggs are laid in groups forming
'egg-rafts'. A female Culex mosquito may lay a raft of eggs every third
seven times. When the eggs mature they will hatch into larvae regardless
of the availability of water. The eggs are dark coloured and either elongate
or ovoid. Hatching is temperature-dependent and occurs after several days
to weeks, but in some temperate species eggs may overwinter. All four
larval stages are aquatic. In Cuiex spp larvae take in air through a pair of
spiracles situated at the end of a small tube called the respiratory siphon.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: Culicines are important vectors of a range of arboviruses.
Species of Culex transmit both the dog heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis and
avian malaria caused by Plasmodium. They also act as vectors for the
filarid worm Setaria labiatopapillosa, cause of ovine abdominal filariosis,
1729
Setaria equina, the equine abdominal worm, and Setaria congolensis in
pigs.

CULICOIDES:MIDGES
Predilection site: Skin
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Ceratopogonidae
Description: Insects within the large nematoceran family, the
Ceratopogonidae, are known as the biting midges. The family contains
one main genus of veterinary interest, Culicoides. Culicoides biting
midges are among the most abundant of haematophagous insects, with
over 1000 species that feed on birds or mammals, inflicting a painful bite.
They transmit many disease pathogens and, most importantly, act as
vectors of more than 50 arboviruses.

Culicoides midge adults are 1.5-5.0 mm in length with the thorax humped
over a small head (Fig. 11.51). The wings are generally mottled in pattern,
and at rest are held like a closed pair of scissors over the grey or brownish
black abdomen. The legs are relatively short, particularly the forelegs, and
the small mouth-parts hang vertically. The short piercing proboscis
consists of a sharp labrum, two maxillae, two mandibles, a hypopharynx
and a fleshy labium, which does not enter the skin during feeding by the
adult female. In the male, the long antennae are feathery or plumose,
whereas those of the female possess only short hairs and are known as
pilose antennae. Microscopic hairs cover the wings. Ceratopogonids have
1731
a forked medial vein (M1, M2) and species of the genus Culicoides usually
have a distinct pattern of radial cells and an r-m cross-vein on their wings
(Fig. 11.51).
Hosts: All domestic animals and humans
Life cycle: The eggs, which are brown or black, are cylindrical or
banana-shaped and 0.5 mm in length. Eggs are laid in damp marshy
ground or in decaying vegetable matter near water. Hatching occurs in 2-9
days depending on the species and temperature, but temperate species may
overwinter as eggs. There are four larval stages and these are characterised
by having small dark heads, segmented bodies and terminal anal gills.
They have a serpentine swimming action in water and feed on decaying
vegetation. Larval development is complete in warm countries in 14-25
months. The less active brown pupae, 2.0-4.0 mm long, are found at the
surface or edges of water and are characterised by a pair of respiratory

not strong fliers and they are usually found close to larval habitats in small
humid weather and tend to be crepuscular and nocturnal. Females are
attracted to the smell and warmth of their hosts and different species may
be host specific to varying degrees.
Geographical distribution: Worldwide
Pathogenesis: In large numbers, biting midges can be a serious source of
irritation and annoyance to livestock. The main areas affected are usually
the head and neck. The biting of midges has been linked to an
pruritic skin disease of horses, described as seasonal equine pruritic
dermatitis. Symptoms include pruritus, crusting and alopecia of the face,
ears, withers, mane, rump and tail. The lesions are exacerbated by
 n      
thickening. This is one of the most common allergic skin diseases in
itch' in Australia. In the UK, the disease is particularly a problem of
1732
likely to be inherited. Several species are involved in this condition, C.
pulicaris in Europe, C. robertsi in Australia and C. insignis, C. stelifer and
C. venustus in the USA.
Culicoides biting midges act as vectors of more than 50 arboviruses,
which are transmitted across their broad host range, including those
   s s    e 
sheep, African horse sickness, bovine ephemeral fever and, in the USA,
eastern equine encephalitis. Species of Cuficoides may act as mechanical
gibsoni to cattle, Onchocerca cervicalis to horses and several species of
protozoa (Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon) to poultry and other birds.
Clinical signs: The host animal's reaction to a bite of a Culicoides midge
typically consists of a localised stinging or burning sensation and a well
defined reddened area around the bite site. These may remain itchy from a
few minutes to 2-3 days, and will cause the host animal to rub and scratch
at the area.
Diagnosis: The bite of the adult flies leaves a characteristic reddened area
and may remain itchy for several days. Flies may be seen on the host
animal.
Epidemiology: Culicoides adults are crepuscular or nocturnal feeders,
particularly prevalent in dull, humid weather. Flight activity can be
influenced by temperature, light intensity, lunar cycles, relative humidity,
wind velocity and other weather conditions. The mean distance travelled
shorter distances. Adult Cuficoides are usually found close to larval
habitats in small and inconspicuous swarms. Females are attracted to the
smell and warmth of their hosts, and different species may be host specific
to varying degrees, for example C. brevitarsis feeds mainly on cattle and
C.imicola onhorses.
There is a large number of species of Culicoides of varying importance as
nuisance pests and vectors. Of particular note in Europe and Asia are
Culicoides pulicaris, Culicoides obsoletus (a complex of four separate
species),Culicoides impunctatus and Culicoides sibirica.Culicoides
imicola is found throughout Africa and southern Europe and is the key
vector of African horse sickness and blue tongue virus. In North America,
1733
Culicoides furens and Culicoides denningi inflict painful bites and
Culicoides variipennis is the primary vector of blue tongue virus.
Treatment: Flies spend limited time on their hosts and are difficult to
control using insecticides unless these have rapid killing or repellent
ability. Applications of pyrethroid insecticides may give effective, though
short-term, local control.
Control: This is difficult because of the usually extensive breeding habitat
and depends on the destruction of breeding sites by drainage or spraying
with insecticides. Repellents or screens may be used, but the latter have to
be so fine that they may reduce air-flow, so screens impregnated with
    a n   s
recommended instead. For ^sweet itch', antihistamine treatment may give
immediate relief and the regular application of synthetic pyrethroid
dressings may help prevent recurrence of the condition. It is also
recommended that susceptible animals be housed when fly activity is
maximal, usually in late afternoon and early morning.
Notes: Blue tongue virus (BTV) exists as a number of distinct serotypes,
24 of which have been recognised to date. These viruses can infect a wide
range of ruminant species, but usually only cause severe disease in certain
breeds of sheep, particularly the fine-fleeced species, such as Merino and
Dorset Horn. In sheep it causes fever, enteritis, upper respiratory tract
infection, ulceration of the tongue and lameness. BTV can cause very high
mortality, in excess of 25%, and morbidity in excess of 75%. Blue tongue
occurs generally in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and parts of
North America, and serious outbreaks have occurred in the past 50 years
in southern Europe. In one such outbreak, between 1956 and 1960, over

birds, and the primary midge vector is Culicoides melanura.
Bovine ephemeral fever, also known as 3-day sickness, is caused by an
arbovirus. It is found throughout Africa, the Oriental region and
occasionally causes epizootics in Australia. It affects cattle causing
morbidity, but usually not mortality, resulting in reduced milk yields.
BLACKFLIES.BUFFALO GNATS
Simuliumspp
Common name: Blackflies, buffalo gnats
Predilection site: Adult Simulium feed all over the body, but particularly
the head, abdomen and legs.
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Simuliidae
Description: More than 1700 species of blackflies have been described
worldwide, although only 10-20% of these are regarded as pests of
humans and their animals. As their common names indicate, these flies are
usually black with a humped thorax. The adults are 1.5-5 mm in length,
relatively stout-bodied, with broad, colourless wings that show indistinct
venation and are held at rest like the closed blades of a pair of scissors.
The wings are short, typically 1.5-6.5 mm long, broad with a large anal
lobe and have veins, which are thickened at the anterior margin of the
wing (Fig. 1l.52). The first abdominal tergite is modified to form a
prominent basal scale, fringed with fine hairs. Morphologically, adult
in the female the eyes are distinctly separated (dichoptic), whereas in
males the eyes are very close together (holoptic) with characteristic
enlarged ommatidia in the upper part of the eye. This enables males to
locate females against the blue backdrop of the sky. Compared with other
closely related flies, the antennae, although ll-segmented, are relatively
1735
short, stout and devoid of bristles. The mouthparts resemble those of the
biting midges except for the presence of conspicuous segmented maxillary
 palps. The body is covered with short golden or silvery hairs.

There may be up to eight larval stadia. The mature larvae are 5.0-13.0 mm
long, light coloured and poorly segmented, and are distinguishable by a
blackish head, which bears a prominent pair of feeding brushes (Fig.
11.53). The body is swollen posteriorly and just below the head is an
appendage called the proleg, which bears hooks. Larvae normally remain
attached to submerged vegetation or rocks by a circlet of posterior hooks,
but may change their position in a looping manner by alternate use of the
proleg and the posterior hooks. The larvae remain in areas of fast-flowing
current, since they require highly oxygenated water to survive. They use
the water current to passively filter feed on suspended debris and bacteria.
In deoxygenated water, the larvae detach from their silken pads and drift
downstream. Larval maturation takes from several weeks to several
months, and in some species larvae can overwinter. Mature larvae pupate
in a slipper-shaped brownish cocoon fixed to submerged objects. The
pupa has prominent respiratory gills projecting from the cocoon. In the
final stages of pupation, a film of air is secreted between the developing
adult and the pupal cuticle. When the pupal case splits the emerging adult
rises to the surface in a bubble of air and is able to fly away immediately.
The pupal period is normally 2-6 days and a characteristic feature of
flies, which gain the surface of the water and take flight. The duration of
the life cycle, from egg to adult, is variable, depending on the species and
weeks to as long as 85 days. Adult flies feed on plant nectar, but in most

graze cattle during the spring due to the activity of these flies. Horses are
anaemic from blood loss when attacked. Even at relatively low population
densities the painful bites may cause considerable disturbance and reduced
productivity. Some host animals may suffer from allergic reactions to

act as vectors for filarioid helminths, such as the nematodes Onchocerca
Bovine and equine onchocerciasis produce nodules containing adult
worms in various regions of the skin, particularly the withers of cattle,
resulting in hide damage. From a medical perspective Simulidae are
particularly important as vectors of the filaroid nematode Onchocerca
vofvufus, which causes river blindness in humans in Africa, Central and
South America.
Clinical signs: Simulids cause severe irritation to livestock when they
occur in large numbers and herds will often stampede. Bites are inflicted
on all parts of the body and give rise to vesicles, which burst, exposing the
underlying flesh. These skin wounds heal very slowly.

numbers in the tropics during the rainy season. In temperate and arctic
regions the biting nuisance may be seasonal, since adults die in the
autumn with new generations in spring and summer. The adult flies are
found in swarms near free-running, well aerated streams, which are their
breeding sites. Some rivers can produce nearly a billion flies per kilometre
of riverbed per day. Adults are strong fliers and are highly responsive to
carbon dioxide and other hostanimal odours. They may fly as many as 48
1740
miles in search of a host, before returning to the breeding site to
commence oviposition.
Treatment: Flies spend limited time on their hosts and are difficult to
control using insecticides unless these have rapid killing or repellent
activity. Applications of pyrethroid insecticides may give effective,
though short-term, local control.
Control: Blackfly control is extremely difficult since immature larval
stages are found in running, well aerated water, often some distance from
the farm or housing, and adult flies are capable of flying over 5 km. The
most practical control method is the application of insecticides to breeding
sites to kill larvae. This technique has been developed for the control of
Simulium species, which are vectors of *river blindness' in man in Africa.
and  entails  the  repeated  application  of insecticides  to  selected
water-courses at intervals throughout the year. The insecticide is then
carried downstream and kills larvae over long stretches of water.
Alternatively, bush clearing will remove adult resting sites and aerial
application of insecticides may help in areas where breeding occurs in
networks of small streams and watercourses. [n horses, insecticides or
repellents may be applied topically, and poultry can be provided with
insecticidal dust baths.
Species of importance: Possibly the most damaging simulid of
temperate latitudes in the New World is Simulium arcticum which can be
a major livestock pest in western Canada. Populations can reach densities
which are high enough to kill cattle. In the USA, Simulium venustum and
Simulium vittatum may be common and widespread pests of livestock,
particularly common in June and July. Simulium pecuarum, the southern
buffalo gnat, may cause losses in cattle in the Mississippi valley. The
turkey gnat, Simufium meridionale, is common in southern USA and the
Mississippi valley, where it may be a significant pest of poultry. Simulium

damaging in central and southern Europe is Simulium colombaschense,
which may cause heavy mortality of livestock.

SANDFLIES
Phlebotomus spp
Common name:Phlebotomine sandflies
Predilection site: Skin; sandflies primarily bite areas of exposed skin
such as the ears, eyelids, nose, feet and tail
Parasite class: Insecta
Family: Psychodidae
Description, adults: These small flies, up to 5.0 mm long, are
legs (Fig. 11.54). The wings, which, unlike those of other biting flies are
lanceolate in outline, are also covered in hairs and are held erect over the
body at rest. As in many other Nematoceran flies, the mouthparts are of
short to medium length, hang downwards and are adapted for piercing and
sucking. The maxillary palps are relatively conspicuous and consist of five
segments. In both sexes the antennae are long, 16-segmented, filamentous
andcoveredinfine setae.
Larvae: The mature larva is greyish white with a dark head. The head
matter. The antennae are small. The abdominal segments bear hairs and
ventral, unsegmented leg-like structures (pseudopods) which are used in
presence of long caudal setae; one pair in first-stage larvae and two pairs
in second-, third-and fourth-stage larvae.

Hosts: Many mammals, reptiles, birds and humans
Life cycle: Up to 100 ovoid, 0.3-0.4 mm long, brown or black eggs may
be laid at each oviposition in small cracks or holes in the ground, the
floors of animal houses, or in leaf litter. Although not laid in water the
eggs need moist conditions for survival, as do the larvae and pupae. A
optimal conditions the eggs can hatch in 1-2 weeks, but this may be
prolonged in cold weather. The larvae, which resemble small caterpillars,
scavenge on organic matter and can survive flooding. There are four larval
stages, maturation taking 3 weeks to several months, depending on
        si
these flies overwinter as mature larvae. The mature larvae are 4-6 mm in
length, have a well developed black head with eyespots, and a segmented
greyish body, which is covered in bristles. The pupae attach themselves to
1743
the substrate in an erect position with the exuviae of the last larval instar
attached at the caudal end. The adults emerge from pupation after 1-2
weeks. The whole life cycle takes 30-100 days, or even longer in cool
weather.
Geographical distribution: Widely distributed in the tropics, subtropics
and the Mediterranean area. Most species prefer semi-arid and savannah
regions to forests.
Pathogenesis: These flies inflict a painful bite, causing irritation and
blood loss, which may lead to a reduction in weight gain. Apart from their
biting nuisance in localised areas, phlebotomine sandflies are important as
known vectors of Leishmania spp which cause cutaneous and visceral
leishmaniasis in humans. Dogs are important reservoir hosts in some
regions.
Pathogenesis and pathology: Sandflies are important as vectors of
various pathogens. Of particular importance is leishmaniasis in humans
 pasneo saseasip aui dds nunuysiag ueozoond au Aq pasnes 'saop pue
humans are commonly classiffied as either visceral (kala-azar) or
cutaneous infections. Dogs, cats, rodents and other wild animals act as
reservoirs of infection. Dogs affected with cutaneous leishmaniasis have a
non-pruritic, exfoliative dermatitis with  alopecia and peripheral
hepatomegaly, generalised lymphadenopathy, lameness, anorexia, weight
loss and death. The disease has also been reported in cats. In North
America, sandflies may also act as vectors of vesicular stomatitis of cattle
Clinical signs: The bites of these flies are painful and irritating to the
host, giving rise to weals in soft-skinned animals. Sandflies particularly
bite areas of exposed skin such as the ears, eyelids, nose, feet and tail.
Diagnosis: Sandflies may be visible on the host during the night. During
the day sandflies can most often be collected in the field and are not
usually seen on animals.
Epidemiology: In common with many other small biting flies, only the
females suck blood. They prefer to feed at night, resting in shaded areas
during the day. Since they are capable of only limited flight, nuisance due
to biting may be confined to certain areas near the breeding sites. There is
1744
some seasonality in activity, the numbers of flies increasing during the
rainy season in the tropics, whereas they are only present during the
summer months in temperate zones. Adults often accumulate in the
burrows of rodents or in other shelters, such as caves, where the
microclimate is suitable.
Treatment: The most effective method to prevent fly bites and
transmission of infection is to ensure that animals avoid areas of high fly
density and are kept indoors when fly activity is highest. Flies spend
limited time on their hosts and are difficult to control using insecticides
unless these have rapid killing or repellent activity. Permethrin and
deltamethrin are the only insecticides with sufficient repellent activity and
rapidity of action to make them suitable for the control of sandfly biting in
dogs. Neither drug is suitable for cats.
        
phlebotomine sandflies, probably due to the fact that leishmaniasis has
merited insufficient attention as a disease, and also because little is known
in detail of the biology and ecology of the developing stages of these flies.
The adults are, however, susceptible to most insecticides, and where there
have been spraying campaigns to control the mosquito vectors of malaria
these have effectively controlled Phlebotomus. Removal of dense
vegetation may reduce the suitability of the environment for the breeding
of theseflies.
Notes: The large family Psychodidae, sub-family Phlebotominae, contains
a single genus of veterinary importance in the Old World, Phlebotomus,
and a single genus of veterinary importance in the New World, Lutzomyia.
In some areas of the world, the term ‘sandflies’ includes some biting
midges and blackflies, and should be distinguished by referring to them as
phlebotomine sandflies'.

The epidemiology of
parasitic diseases
Although the reasons for the occurrence of parasitic diseases are multiple
and often interactive, the vast majority occur for one of four basic reasons.
These are:
1. An increase in the numbers of infective stages.
2. An alteration in host susceptibility.
3. The introduction of susceptible stock.
4. The introduction of infection into a clean environment.
Each of these will be discussed in turn, giving examples.

This category involves parasitic diseases which occur seasonally, and
although more distinct in zones with a wide climatic variation, may also

A multiplicity of causes is responsible for the seasonal fluctuations in the
        
1746
conveniently grouped as factors affecting contamination of the
environment, and those controlling the development and survival of the
free-living stages of the parasites and, where applicable, their intermediate
hosts.
CONTAMINATIONOFTHE
ENVIRONMENT
The level of contamination is influenced by several factors.
BIOTICPOTENTIAL
 g    g       ss
as measured by its fecundity. Thus, some nematodes, such as Haemonchus
contortus and Ascaris suum, produce many thousands of eggs daily, while
others, like Trichostrongylus, produce only a few hundred. Egg production
by some external parasites such as the blowfly, Lucilia sericata, or the
tick, Ixodes ricinus, is also very high, whereas Glossina spp produce
relatively few offspring.
The biotic  potential  of  parasites  which  multiply  either  within  an
intermediate or final host is also considerable. For example, the infection
of Gaiba (Lymnaea) with one miracidium of the trematode Fasciola
hepatica can give rise to several hundred cercariae. Within the final host,
protozoal parasites such as Eimeria, because of merogony and
gametogony, also give rise to a rapid increase in the contamination of the
environment.
STOCKMANAGEMENT
The density of stocking can influence the level of contamination and is
multiplication of the parasite takes place outside the final host. It has the
greatest influence when climatic conditions are optimal for development
of the contaminating eggs or larvae, such as in spring and summer in the
northern hemisphere.
1747
A high stocking density will also favour the spread of ectoparasitic
conditions such as pediculosis and sarcoptic mange, where close contact
between animals facilitates the spread of infection. This may occur under
crowded conditions in cattle yards, or from mother to offspring where, for
example, sows and their litters are in close contact.
[In coccidiosis, where large numbers of oocysts are disseminated,
management procedures which encourage the congregation of stock, such
as the gathering of lambs around feeding troughs, may lead rapidly to
heavycontamination.
In temperate countries, where livestock are stabled during the winter, the
date of turning out to graze in spring will influence contamination of
pasture with helminth eggs. Since many helminth infective stages, which
have survived the winter, succumb during late spring, the withholding of
stock until this time will minimise subsequent infection.
MMUNESTATUSOFTHEHOST
Clearly, the influence of stocking density will be greatest if all the stock
are fully susceptible, or if the ratio of susceptible to immune stock is high.
beefherds.
However, even where the ratio of adults to juveniles is low it must be
remembered that ewes, sows, female goats, and to a lesser extent cows,
become more susceptible to many helminths during late pregnancy and
early lactation due to the periparturient relaxation in immunity. In most
areas of the world, parturition in grazing animals, synchronised to occur
with the climate most favourable to pasture growth, is also the time most
suitable for development of the free-living stages of most helminths. Thus,
the epidemiological significance of the periparturient relaxation of
immunity is that it ensures increased contamination of the environment
when the number of susceptible animals is increasing.
There is some evidence that resistance to intestinal protozoal infections
such as coccidiosis and toxoplasmosis is also lowered during pregnancy
and lactation, and so enhances spread of these important infections.
On the credit side, host immunity will limit the level of contamination by
modifying the development of new infections either by their destruction or
1748
arrest at the larval stages, while existing adult worm burdens are either
Although immunity to ectoparasites is less well defined, in cattle it
develops against most species of ticks, although in a herd this expression
of resistance often inadvertently results in an overdispersed population of
ticks with the susceptible young animals carrying most of the ticks.
In protozoal diseases, such as babesiosis or theile- riosis, the presence of
immune adults also limits the likelihood of ticks becoming infected;
however, this effect is not absolute since such animals are often silent
carriers of these protozoal infections.
HYPOBIOSIS/DIAPAUSE
These terms are used to describe an interruption in development of a

the host and occurs seasonally, usually at a time when conditions are
adverse to the development and survival of the free-living stages. The
epidemiological importance of hypobiosis is that the resumption of
development of hypobiotic larvae usually occurs when conditions are
optimal for free-living development and so results in an increased
contamination of the environment. There are many examples of seasonal
hypobiosis in nematodes including Ostertagia/Teladorsagia infections in
ruminants, Hyostrongyius rubidus in pigs and Trichonema spp in horses.
Diapause in arthropods, like hypobiosis in nematodes, is also considered
to be an adaptation phenomenon whereby ectoparasites survive adverse
conditions by a cessation of growth and metabolism at a particular stage.
       i    
Depending on the extremity of the northern or southern latitudes, this may
occur after one or several generations. For example, the headfly,
Hydrotoea irritans, in northern latititudes, has only one annual cycle and
overwinters as a mature larva in diapause. Other insects, such as Stomoxys
caicitrans or blowflies in these latitudes, have several generation cycles
1749
before entering diapause.  Diapause occurs less in parasites which
continuously infect the hosts, such as mange mites or lice.
To date, similar phenomena have not been ascribed to protozoa, although
similar hypothesis has been proposed.

Thefactorsthataffectdevelopmentandsurvivalaremainly
environmental,  especially
management practices. Current changes in the global climate are
anticipated to influence the infective stages of many parasites and/or the
prevalence of some intermediate hosts. For example, the trend towards
prevalence of Fasciola hepatica infection in ruminants in some temperate
regions.
THEMICROHABITAT
Several environmental factors which affect the microhabitats of free-living
parasitic stages are vital for development and survival. Thus moderate
temperatures and high humidity favour development of most parasites,
while cool temperatures prolong survival. The microclimate humidity
depends, of course, not only on rainfall and temperature, but on other
elements such as soil structure, vegetation type and drainage. Soil type
turn, determines the degree to which a layer of ^mat' is formed between
the soil and the herbage. The mat is abundant in older pastures and holds a
permanent store of moisture in which the relative humidity remains high
even after weeks of drought. The presence of this moisture and pockets of
  s a go  a i r a u! pddn 
factors favour the development and survival of helminth larvae, ticks,
larval stages of insects and coccidial oocysts.
1750
In contrast, the use of rotational cropping of pastures reduces the influence
of *mat' and therefore parasite survival. In the arid tropics pasture growth
is usually negligible causing a similar effect.
In the same way, a high groundwater table is important for the
development and survival of intermediate snail vectors of trematodes,
such as liver and rumen flukes.
The development and survival of helminth eggs or larvae within faeces are
also dependent on temperature and moisture. The host species may also
influence this situation since normal cattle faeces remain in their original
form for a longer time than, say, sheep pellets. Thus the moisture content
at the centre of a bovine faecal pat remains high for several weeks or even
months and so provides shelter for developing larvae until the outside
environment is suitable.
Dictyocauius larvae may also be distributed with the spores of the fungus
Pilobofus which grow in bovine faeces, while several species of nematode

SEASONALDEVELOPMENT
[n temperate countries with distinct seasons of summer and winter there is
a limited number of generations and the same is true of countries with
distinct dry and wet seasons. In Britain, for example, there has generally
only been one, or at the most two, parasitic generations of the common
trichostrongyle infections of ruminants, since larval development on the
pasture occurs only from late spring through to early autumn, the peak
levels of infective larvae being present from July until September. This
           
milder and longer seasons. In tropical climates there may be numerous
for the development and survival of the free-living stages are optimal.
The development of large numbers of infective stages of parasites within
distinct seasons is usually followed by a high mortality rate within a few
weeks. However, considerable numbers survive for much longer than is
commonly realised. For example, in the helminths, significant numbers of
1751
metacercariae ofFasciolahepatica and infectivelarvaeof
trichostrongyles are capable of survival for at least 9 months in Britain.
Dipteran fly populations also vary in the number of generations per year.
Using the blowflies as an example, there are three or four generations, and
there are usually only two, temperature being the limiting factor. In the
humid tropical or subtropical countries the development of trichostrongyle
larvae or fly populations proceeds throughout most of the year and,
although this may be slower at certain times, there will be numerous
generationsper annum.
Although the permanent ectoparasites, such as lice or mange mites, live on
or in the skin of animals and, therefore, in an apparently stable
due to seasonal factors or human intervention. In the northern hemisphere
development of these parasites is optimal in the winter when the coat is
long and the micro-environment humid and temperate.
Apart from the free-living stages of coccidian parasites, which have
seasonal requirements similar to those of the trichostrongyles, the
prevalence of other protozoan infections is related to the feeding activity
of their arthropod vectors. For example, in Britain, babesiosis in cattle
occurs at peak times of tick activity in the spring and autumn, although
tick activity has become less confined to these times of the year.
STOCKMANAGEMENT
The availability of helminth infective stages is also affected by certain
management practices. Thus, a high density of stocking increases the level
of contamination, and, by lowering the sward height, enhances the
availability of the larval stages largely concentrated in the lower part of
the herbage. Also, the scarcity of grass may induce animals to graze closer
to faeces than otherwise. However, against this, the microclimate in a
short sward is more susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity
and so the free-living stages may, on adverse occasions, be particularly
vulnerable. This may explain why the helminth burdens of ruminants in
close-cropped set-stocked pastures are often less than those in animals on
rotated pastures.
1752
Similarly, many pasture improvement schemes have direct or indirect
effects on arthropod populations. Improved host nutrition results from
pasture improvement and helps to maintain host resistance to parasitism.
However, pasture improvement, particularly in the tropics, can increase
the breeding success of ticks and of those dipteran flies which lay their
eggs in faeces, by increasing the shelter available. Furthermore, the
increased stocking rates on improved pastures may increase the chances of
parasites finding a host.
The date of parturition in a flock or herd may also influence the likelihood
of parasitic infection. Where livestock are born out of season the numbers
of trichostrongyle infective stages are usually lower and the chance of
infection is postponed until the young animals are older and stronger.
AN ALTERATION IN
HOSTSUSCEPTTIBILITY
This may refer to existing infections or to the acquisition of new
infections.
ALTEREDEFFECTS OFAN
EXISTINGINFECTION
This is observed principally in adolescent or adult stock which are
with disease and may be explained by various dietary and host factors.
DIET
It is well known that adequately fed animals are better able to tolerate
parasitism than animals on a low plane of nutrition. Thus, ruminants
affected with blood-sucking helminths, such as Haemonchus contortus or
Fasciola hepatica, may be able to maintain their haemoglobin levels as
long as their iron intake is adequate. However, if their iron reserves
1753
become low theirhaemopoeitic systems become exhausted and they may
die. Similarly, cattle may grow at a reasonable rate with moderate
trichostrongylid burdens even though some loss of protein is occurring
through the alimentary mucosa. However, if there is a change in diet
which reduces their protein intake, they are unable to compensate for the
loss of protein and lose weight.
These deleterious effects of parasitism, without any change in the level of
 s    s o     
animals during a period of drought.
Incidentally, the same effect is produced when food intake is not increased
during pregnancy and lactation. Good examples of this are the
accumulation of lice on poorly fed animals during the winter and the fact
that the anaemia caused by ticks is greater in animals on poor nutrition.
significant. Thus, trichostrongylosis in ruminants is known to impair the
absorption of both calcium and phosphorus and, where the dietary intake
of these is sub-optimal, osteoporosis can occur. Also, the deleterious
effects of some abomasal parasites in sheep are greater where there is a
cobalt deficiency and, in such animals, levels of parasitism generally
considered to be non-pathogenic may be associated with severe diarrhoea
and weight loss.

influences fetal growth and subsequently that of the neonate through poor
milk production by the dam. This has been clearly illustrated in sows
infected with moderate burdens of Oesophagostomum dentatum and in
ewes infected with helminths such as Haemonchus or Fasciola.
STEROIDTHERAPY
Steroids are widely used in therapy of both man and animals and it is
known that they may alter the susceptibility to parasitism. A good
example of this is in the cat infected with Toxoplasma gondi; excretion of

in grazing animals will result in the eventual establishment of higher
numbers of trichostrongyles than were present prior to treatment.
Excessive application of acaricides to control ticks may also lower herd

HYPERSENSITIVITY
In many instances, at least part of the immune response to parasites is

Where this occurs in the gut, as in intestinal nematode infections, the
reaction is associated with an increased permeability of the gut to
macromolecules such as protein, and this may be a significant factor in
immune animals under heavy larval challenge. In sheep, for example,
relatively poor growth rates and poor wool production may result.
A stunting effect has also been observed in tick- resistant animals which
are under constant challenge, while pet animals repeatedly exposed to
mite infestations may have severely thickened, hyperaemic and sensitive
skins, although only neglible numbers of mites are present.
THE INTRODUCTION OF
SUSCEPTIBLE STOCK
Parasitism may result from the movement of susceptible stock into an
infected environment due to the following factors.
1756
ABSENCEOFACQUIRED
IMMUNITY
The common nematode diseases of ruminants provide the best examples
of outbreaks of parasitic disease following the movement of calves into
infected areas. For example, in western Europe the cattle lungworm,
Dictyocaufus viviparus, is endemic; the most severe outbreaks are seen in
calves born in early spring and turned out in late summer to graze
alongside older batches of calves which have grazed from early spring.
Overwintered larval populations have cycled in these older calves and
when the fresh populations of infective larvae, which develop from these
infections, accrue on pasture, the younger calves, with no previous
experience of infection, are extremely susceptible.
The occurrence of 'cysticercosis storms' in adult cattle, grazed on fields
contaminated with eggs of the human tapeworm, Taenia saginata, or
handled by infected stockmen, are occasionally reported in Europe and the
USA. This high degree of susceptibility is due to lack of previous

LONGEVITYOFINFECTIVE
STAGES
Especially in temperate zones and in parts of the subtropics, the free-living
stages of most parasites will survive in the environment or in intermediate
hosts for periods sufficiently long to reinfect successive batches of young
animals and may cause disease in these animals within a few weeks of
exposure.
THEINFLUENCEOFGENETIC
FACTORS
BETWEENHOSTSPECIES
Most parasites are host specific and this specificity has been utilised in
integrated control programmes, such as mixed grazing of sheep and cattle,
to control gastrointestinal nematodes. However, some economically
important parasites are capable of infecting a wide range of hosts which
vary in their susceptibility to the effects of the parasite. For example,
cattle seem able to cope with liver fluke infestations which would cause

cattle or sheep to their common gastrointestinal trichostrongyles.
BETWEENBREEDS
animals to parasites varies and is genetically determined. For example,
some breeds of sheep are more susceptible to the abomasal nematode,
Haemonchus contortus, than others; Bos indicus breeds of cattle are more
resistant to ticks andother haematophagous insects than Bos taurus
breeds. In Denmark, the Black Pied cattle are genetically deficient in their
cellular immune responses and have proved more susceptible to liver
fluke, while the N'dama breed of cattle in west Africa is known to be
tolerant to trypanosomosis.
1758
Even within flocks or herds, individual responders and non-responders, in
terms of their ability to develop resistance to internal and external
parasites, are usually present and it is recommended by some experts that
culling of the poorest responders should take place.
SEX
There is some evidence that entire male animals are more susceptible than
females to some helminth infections. This could be of importance in
countries where castration is not routinely practised, or where androgens
are used to fatten castrates or cull cows.
STRAIN OF PARASITE
d  nxa    s   r
infections, there is now evidence that strains of helminths occur which
vary in infectivity and pathogenicity.  The increasing prevalence of
drug-resistant isolates of many parasites is another point which should be
considered when disease outbreaks occur in herds, flocks or studs where
 control measures are routinely applied.

INTRODUCTIONOFNEWSTOCK
One of the current trends inthe internationallivestock arenais the
movement of breeding stock from country to country. Quarantine
restrictions and vaccination requirements are stringent in relation to
epidemic diseases, but limited or non-existent for parasitic diseases. When
infected animals are moved into an area previously free from any given
parasite the infection may cycle, provided suitable conditions exist, and
the consequences for the indigenous stock can be extremely serious.
Examples of this category include the introduction of Toxocara vitulorum
r s n n e      
from mainland Europe and transmission occurring via the dam's milk. The
spread of Parafilaria bovicola in Sweden, presumably introduced with
southern Europe, is another example. In the USA, Australia and Britain
the increased movement of human populations and their pets has seen the
spread of a number of diseases of dogs including heartworm, canine
babeiosis and ehrlichiosis, infections previously limited to more tropical
areas. In some of these situations, competent arthropod vectors suitable for
mange in cattle, originally confined to southern Europe, is now endemic in
Belgium and Germany due to trade in breeds of cattle. Protozoal diseases,
such as toxoplasmosis, have been introduced into sheep flocks in countries
where it was previously absent, by the importation of infected sheep.
Babesiosis has also spread where animals carrying infected ticks have
moved into non-endemic areas where the ticks were able to become
established.
THEROLE OFEFFLUENT
The transfer of infection from one farm to another via manure has also
been reported. Thus outbreaks of ostertagiosis have occurred in farms
following the application of cattle slurry as a fertiliser, while cysticercosis
storms’ due to Cysticercus bovis have occurred in cattle following the
application of human sewage to pastures. Finally, the application of pig
slurry containing ascarid eggs to pastures subsequently grazed by sheep
has resulted in pneumonia due to migrating ascarid larvae.

Winged insects transmit a number of helminth and protozoal infections,

with Fasciola hepatica resulted in the snails becoming infected and,
subsequently, outbreaks of clinical fasciolosis.

Resistance to parasitic
diseases
Broadly speaking, resistance to parasitic infections falls into two
categories. The first of these, often termed innate resistance, includes
species resistance, age resistance and in some cases breed resistance,
which, by and large, are not immunological in origin. The second
category, acquired immunity, is dependent on antigenic stimulation and
subsequent humoral and cellular responses. Although, for reasons
explained below, there are few vaccines available against parasitic
diseases, natural expression of acquired immunity plays a highly
significant role in protecting animals against infections and in modulating
the epidemiology of many parasitic diseases.
SPECIES RESISTANCE
For a variety of parasitological, physiological and biochemical reasons,
many parasites do not develop at all in other than their natural hosts; this
is typified by, for example, the remarkable host specificity of the various
species of Eimeria. In many instances however, a limited degree of
development occurs, although this is not usually associated with clinical
signs; for example, some larvae of the cattle parasite Ostertagia ostertagi
          o
However, in these unnatural or aberrant hosts, and especially with
1762
example of this is visceral larva migrans in children due to Toxocara
canis, which is associated with hepatomegaly and occasionally ocular and
cerebral involvement.
Some parasites, of course, have a very wide host range, Trichinella
spiralis, Fasciola hepatica, Cryptosporidium parvum and the asexual
stages of Toxoplasma being four examples
AGE RESISTANCE
Many animals become more resistant to primary infections with some
parasites as they reach maturity. For example, ascarid infections of
old. If hosts are infected at an older age, the parasites either fail to
develop, or are arrested as larval stages in the tissues; likewise, patent
Strongyloides infections of ruminants and horses are most commonly seen
in very young animals. Sheep of more than 3 months of age are relatively
resistant to Nematodirus battus, and in a similar fashion dogs gradually
develop resistance to infection with Ancylostoma over their first year of
life.
The reasons underlying age resistance are unknown, although it has been
relationship has not yet fully evolved. Thus, while the parasite can
develop in immature animals, it has not yet completely adapted to the
adult.
On the other hand, where age resistance is encountered, most parasitic
species seem to have developed an effective counter-mechanism. Thus,
Ancylostoma caninum,Toxocara canis,Toxocara mystax, Toxocara
vitulorum and Strongyloides spp all survive as larval stages in the tissues
of the host, only becoming activated during late pregnancy to infect the
young in utero or by the transmammary route. In the case of Nematodirus
battus, the critical hatching requirements for the egg, i.e. prolonged chill
followed by a temperature in excess of 10°C, ensure the parasites′ survival
as a lamb-to-lamb infection from one season to the next.
1763
Oddly enough, with Babesia and Anaplasma infection of cattle, there is
generally thought to be an inverse age resistance, in that young animals
are more resistant than older naive animals.
BREED RESISTANCE
In recent years, there has been considerable practical interest in the fact

Probably the best example of this is the phenomenon of trypanotolerance
displayed by west African humpless cattle, such as the N'dama, which

although it is thought that immunological responses may play a role.
In helminth infections, it has been shown that the Red Masai sheep,
indigenous to east Africa, is more resistant to Haemonchus contortus
infection than some imported breeds studied in that area, whilst in South
Africa it has been reported that the Merino is less susceptible to
trichostrongylosis than certain other breeds.

Merino, Scottish Blackface and Finn Dorset sheep which are homozygous
for haemoglobin A, develop smaller worm burdens after infection than
their haemoglobin B homozygous or heterozygous counterparts.
Unfortunately, these genotypic differences in susceptibility often break
down under heavy challenge.
          
Merino lambs may be divided into responders and non-responders on the
basis of their immunological response to infection with Trichostrongylus
colubriformis and that these differences are genetically transferred to the
next generation.
The selection of resistant animals could be of great importance, especially
in many developing areas of the world, but in practice would be most

rather than be dependent on laboratory tests.
In Australia resistance to ticks, particularly Boophiius, has been shown to
breeds and low in the European, Bos taurus, breeds. However, where
cattle are 50% Zebu, or greater, in genetic constitution, a high degree of
resistance is still possible allowing a limited use of acaricides.
ACQUIRED IMMUNITY
TOHELMINTH
INFECTIONS
[mmune responses to helminths are complex, possibly depending on
antigenic stimulation by secretory or excretory products released during
the development of the L3 to the adult. For this reason it has only been
possible to develop one  or  two practical  methods of artificial
immunisationof  which the radiation-attenuated vaccine against
Dictyocaulus viviparus is perhaps the best example.
Despite this, there is no doubt that the success of many systems of grazing
naturally acquired degree of immunity to gastrointestinal nematodes. For
example, experimental observations have shown that an immune adult
sheep may ingest around 50 000 Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) L3 daily
without showing any clinical signs of parasitic gastritis.
THEEFFECTOFTHEIMMUNE
RESPONSE
Dealing first with gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes, the effects of
the immune response may be grouped under three headings, the sequence
reflecting the usual progression of acquired immunity:
1765
the migration and establishment of larvae or, sometimes, by
arresting their development at a larval stage. This type of
inhibition of development should not be confused with the more
larvae on pasture or, in the present state of knowledge, with the
arrested larval development associated with age resistance in, for
example, the ascarids.
may be reduced. The important practical aspect of this mechanism
the great reduction in pasture contamination with eggs and larvae,
which in turn reduces the chance of subsequent reinfection.
3. The development of immunity after a primary infection may be
trichostrongyloid nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a much studied
laboratory model, which has contributed greatly to our understanding of
the mechanisms of host immunity in helminth infection. The infective
stage of this parasite is normally a skin penetrator, but in the laboratory is
usually injected subcutaneously for convenience. The larvae travel via the
bloodstream to the lungs where, having moulted, they pass up the trachea
and are swallowed. On reaching the small intestine they undergo a further
moult and become adult, the time elapsing between infection and
development to egg-laying adults being 5-6 days. The adult population
remains static for about 5 more days. After this time the faecal worm egg
output drops quickly, and the majority of the worms are rapidly expelled
from the gut. This expulsion of adult worms, originally known as the 'self
cure' phenomenon, has been shown to be due to an immune response.
If the rats are reinfected, a smaller proportion of the larval dose arrives in
the intestine, i.e. their migration is stopped. The few adult worms which
do develop in the gut remain stunted and are relatively infertile, and worm
expulsion starts earlier and proceeds at a faster rate.
Under natural grazing conditions larval infections of cattle and sheep are
          
occurs. For example, calves exposed to Dictyocaulus viviparus quite
rapidly acquire patent infections, readily recognisable by the clinical
1766
signs. After a period of a few weeks, immunity develops and the adult
worm burdens are expelled. On subsequent exposure in succeeding years
such animals are highly resistant to challenge, although if this is heavy,
clinical signs associated with the reinfection syndrome, i.e. the
immunological destruction of the invading larvae in the lungs, may be
seen. With Ostertagia and Trichostrongyius infections, the pattern is the
same with the build-up of an infestation of adult worms being followed by
their expulsion and subsequent immunity; in later life only small,
short-lived adult infections are established and eventually the infective
larvae are expelled without any development at all. However, with
gastrointestinal infections in ruminants, the ability to develop good
immune responses is often delayed for some months because of
immunological unresponsiveness.
understood despite considerable research. However it is generally agreed
that such infections produce a state of gut hypersensitivity associated with
an increase of mucosal mast cells in the lamina propria and the production
of worm-specific IgE, much of which becomes bound to the surface of the
mast cells. The reaction of worm antigen, from an existing infection or
from a subsequent challenge, with these sensitised mast cells releases
permeability and hyperproduction of mucus. Some workers have
concluded that these physiological changes simply affect the well-being of
the worms by, for example, lowering the oxygen tension of their
environment, so that they become detached from the mucosa and
subsequently expelled. Others have postulated that, in addition, the

mucosal surface and the significance of sensitised T cells, which are
known to promote the differentiation of mast cells, eosinophils and
mucus-secreting cells, are also currently under study.
With regard to tissue-invading helminths, the most closely studied have
been the schistosomes. Schistosomulae of Schistosoma mansoni may be
attacked by both eosinophils and macrophages, which attach to the
antibody-coated parasite. Eosinophils, especially, attach closely to the
parasites where  their secretions damage the underlying parasite
1767
membrane. Attempts to find if a similar mechanism exists against
Fasciola hepatica have indicated that although eosinophils do attach to
parts of the tegument of the young fluke, the latter seems able to shed its
surface layer to evade damage.
EVASIONOF THEHOST'S
IMMUNE RESPONSE
Despite the evidence that animals are able to develop vigorous immune
responses to many helminth infections, it is now clear that parasites, in the
course of evolution, have capitalised on certain defects in this armoury.
This aspect of parasitology is still in its infancy, but three examples of
immune evasion are described below.
NEONATAL
IMMUNOLOGICAL
UNRESPONSIVENESS
This is the inability of young animals to develop a proper immune
response to some parasitic infections. For example, calves and lambs fail
to develop any useful degree of immunity to reinfection with Ostertagia
grazing season. Similarly, lambs remain susceptible to Haemonchus
contortus infection until they are between 6 months and 1 year old. The
cause of this unresponsiveness is unknown. However, while calves and
lambs ultimately do develop a good immune response to Ostertagia or
Teladorsagia infection, in the sheep/Haemonchus contortus system the
ad suoi e Aq papaaons uao Auaedde si ssauaaisuosaun geeuou
of acquired immunological unresponsiveness, e.g. Merino sheep reared
from birth in a Haemonchus-endemic environment remain susceptible to
reinfection throughout their entire lives.
CONCOMITANTIMMUNITY
This term is used to describe an immunity which acts against invading
larval stages, but not against an existing infection. Thus a host may be
infected with adult parasites,but has a measure of immunity to further
1768
infection. Perhaps the best example is that found with schistosomes, which
are covered by a cytoplasmic syncytium which, unlike the chitinous-like
cuticle of nematodes, would at first seem to be vulnerable to the action of
antibody or cells. However, it has been found that adult schistosomes have
the property of being able to incorporate host antigens, such as blood
group antigens or host immunoglobulin, on their surface membrane to
mask their own foreign antigens.
Concomitant immunity does not appear to operate with Fasciola hepatica
in sheep, in that they remain susceptible to reinfection. On the other hand,
cattle not only expel their primary adult burden of Fasciola hepatica, but
also develop a marked resistance to reinfection. Concomitant immunity
also includes the situation where established larval cestodes may survive
for years in the tissues of the host, although the latter is completely
immune to reinfection. The mechanism is unknown, but it is thought that

reaction.

As well as stimulating the production of specific IgE antibody, helminths
'turn on’ the production of large amounts of non-specific IgE. This may
help the parasite in two ways. First, if mast cells are coated by

adequate quantity.
THEDEBITSIDEOFTHEIMMUNE
RESPONSE
Sometimes immune responses are associated with lesions that are
damaging to the host. For example the pathogenic effects of
oesophogostomosis are frequently attributable to the intestinal nodules of
1769
Oesophagostomum columbianum; similarly, the pathogenic effects of
schistosomosis are due to the egg granulomata, the result of cell-mediated
reactions, in the liver and bladder.
There is evidence from some studies for a negative genetic interaction
between production traits and resistance to parasitism. Sheep which had
been selected for their resistance to gastrointestinal nematode infection
showed a higher incidence of scouring. This may be the result of an
increased hypersensitivity to ingested larvae.
ACQOUIREDIMMUNITY
TO PROTOZOAL
INFECTIONS
As might be anticipated from their microscopic size and unicellular state,
immunological responses against protozoa are similar to those directed
against bacteria. The subject is, however, exceedingly complex and the
following account is essentially a digest of current information on some of
the more important pathogens. As with bacterial infections, immune
both are involved.
Trypanosomosis is a good example of a protozoal disease to which
immunity is primarily humoral. Thus, in vitro, both IgG and IgM can be
shown to lyse or agglutinate trypanosomes and in vivo even a small
amount of immune serum will clear trypanosomes from the circulation,
 uo  n    
phagocytic cells. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of antigenic variation,
another method of immune evasion, prevents these infections being
completely eliminated and typically allows the disease to run a
characteristic course of continuous remissions and exacerbations of
parasitaemia. It is likely, also, that the generalised immunosuppression
induced by this disease, may, sooner or later, limit the responsiveness of
the host.
1770
[t is alsorelevant to note that some of the important lesions of
trypanosomosis, such as anaemia, myocarditis and lesions of skeletal
muscle, are thought to be attributable to the deposition of trypanosome
antigen or immune complexes on these cells leading to their subsequent
destruction by macrophages or lymphocytes, a possible debit effect of the
immuneresponse.
perhaps acting as an opsonin, and facilitating the uptake of infected red
cells by splenic macrophages. Antibody is also transferred in the
colostrum of the mother to the new-born animal and confers a period of
protection against infection.
Finally, in trichomonosis, antibody, presumably produced by plasma cells
in the lamina propria of the uterus and vagina, is present in the mucus
secreted by these organs and to a lesser extent in the plasma. This, in vitro,
kills or agglutinates the trichomonads and is probably the major factor
responsible for the self-limiting infections which typically occur in cows.
Of those protozoal infections against which immunity is primarily
cell-mediated, leishmaniosis is of particular interest in that the amastigotes
invade and proliferate in macrophages whose function, paradoxically, is
the phagocytosis and destruction of foreign organisms. How they survive
in macrophages is unknown, although it has been suggested that they may
release substances which inhibit the enzyme activity of lysosomes or that
the amastigote surface coat is refractory to lysosomal enzymes. The
immunity that develops seems to be cell-mediated, perhaps by cytotoxic T
cells destroying infected macrophages or by the soluble products of
sensitised T cells ‘activating’ macrophages to a point where they are able
to destroy their intracellular parasites. Unfortunately in many cases the
efficacy of the immune response and the consequent recovery is delayed
aetiology.
As noted above, sometimes both humoral and cell-mediated reactions are
involved in immunity, and this seems to be the situation with coccidiosis,
theileriosis and toxoplasmosis.
In coccidiosis, the protective antigens are associated with the developing
1771
for the production of neutralising antibody against the extracellular
sporozoites and merozoites and secondly, in a cell-mediated fashion, by
releasing substances, such as lymphokines, which inhibit the
multiplication of the intracellular stages. The net effect of these two
and a decrease in oocyst production.
As described earlier, the proliferative stages of theilerial infections are the
merogonous stages, which develop in lymphoblasts and divide
During the course of infection, and provided it is not rapidly fatal,
cell-mediated responses are stimulated in the form of cytotoxic T cells
which target on the infected lymphoblasts by recognising two antigens on
the host surface. One of these is derived from the Theileria parasite and
the other is a histocompatibility antigen of the host cell. The role of
      s t   
demonstrated, using an in vitro test, that an antibody against the
sporozoites inoculated by the tick may be highly effective in protection.
In toxoplasmosis also, both humoral and cell-mediated components appear
to be involved in the immune response. However, the relative importance
of their roles remains to be ascertained, although it is generally believed
that antibody formation by the host leads to a cessation in the production
of tachyzoites and to the development of the latent bradyzoite cyst. It is
also believed that recrudescence of tachyzoite activity may occur if the
host becomes immunosuppressed as a consequence of therapy or some
other disease.
ACQUIREDIMMUNITY
TOARTHROPOD
INFECTIONS
It is known that animals exposed to repeated attacks by some insects
gradually develop a degree of acquired immunity. For example, at least in
man, over a period of time the skin reactions to the bites of Culicoides and
1772
mosquitoes usually decrease in severity. Likewise, after several attacks of
calliphorine myiasis, sheep can develop a degree of resistance to further
attack.
A similar sequence of events has been observed with many tick and mite
infestations. The immune reaction to ticks, dependent on humoral and
cell-mediated components to the oral secretions of the ticks, prevents
proper engorgement of the parasites and has serious consequences on their

pig and with psoroptic mange in sheep and cattle, and ‘sweet itch’ of
horses due to skin hypersensitivity to Culicoides bites.
THEFUTUREOF
PARASITEVACCINES
Early approaches investigating the use of live attenuated vaccines resulted
in commercially available vaccines for the bovine lungworm,
Dictyocauius viviparus, and for Eimeria infections in poultry. Apart from
D. viviparus there are no commercially produced vaccines for the control
of helminth infections in ruminants. The increased prevalence of parasites
which are resistant to drug therapy has led to further investment in vaccine
components, and considerable progress has been made in identifying
candidate antigens for several important parasite species.
Vaccines have already been developed, for example, against Taenia ovis
infection in sheep, for Babesia canis in dogs, and for Babesia bovis and
Boophiius micropius in cattle. The commercial success of current
1773
experimental recombinant vaccines will depend not only on their efficacy
    o       
effective, low-cost, delivery systems which will confer long-acting
protection.
Two main approaches have been adopted for vaccine development: those
based on ‘natural antigens', which are recognised by the host during the
course of infection, and those based on *hidden’ or *covert' antigens. The
latter strategy ignores the mechanisms of natural immunity and directs
responses towards molecules located or secreted internally. There have
been encouraging advances towards the aim of producing vaccines for the
control of several parasitic diseases in the last decade. Recent research has

similarly, against the cestodes Echinococcus granulosus, Taenia ovis and
T. saginata using molecules on the surface of the oncosphere stage. The
recombinant T. ovis vaccine is not available commercially, mainly as it is
not an ovine or human pathogen. The economic return for a recombinant
cestode vaccine for developing countries needs to be further evaluated.
HIDDENANTIGENS
An important advantage of using 'covert’ antigens in vaccine strategies is
that they should be effective in those infections where natural immunity is
poorly developed or is ineffective.  A possible disadvantage is that
immunity is not boosted by infection. However, it has been shown in
Haemonchus contortus infection in lambs that vaccination with *hidden'
gut membrane antigens, which are predominantly proteases and which are
not normally recognised by the host during infection, will provide

membrane approach formed the basis of the recombinant vaccine against
Boophiius micropius, the Australian cattle tick.
In conclusion, although considerable progress has been made towards the
experimental production of some monovalent vaccines, it is likely to be
several years before commercially produced recombinant vaccines are
available.

Antiparasitics
INTRODUCTION
It is not practical to give full efficacy data and methods of application of
the large number of drugs currently available against the vast range of
parasites that parasitise domestic animals. As the number of compounds
and their various formulations are continually changing it is perhaps more
appropriate to discuss the use of antiparasitics in general terms, according
to the groups of parasites they target. For the purposes of this chapter,
antiparasitics are  grouped as anthelmintics, ectoparasiticides or
antiprotozoals. Details of their use against individual species or groups of
 parasites have been described under the appropriate sections of the main
text.
ANTHELMINTICS
The control of parasitic helminths in domestic animals relies largely on
the use of anthelmintic drugs. Although anthelmintics are used in all
domestic species, the largest market is undoubtedly the ruminant market,
especially cattle, where millions of pounds are spent annually in an effort
to reduce the effects of parasitism.
1776
ANTHELMINTICSANDTHEIR
MODEOF ACTION
The mode of action of many anthelmintics basically depends on
interference with essential biochemical processes of the parasite, but not
of the host.
The major groups of anthelmintics currently in use against nematodes,
trematodes and cestodes are shown in Table 14.1.
BENZIMIDAZOLES/PRO-BENZIMIDAZOLES
The
benzimidazoles
include
thiabendazole,
parbendazole,
oxibendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, albendazole, triclabendazole
and ricobendazole (albendazole oxide). Three other chemicals, febantel,
netobimin and thiophanate (probenzimidazoles), are also included in this
group because they are metabolised in the body to active benzimidazole
metabolites. Modification of a particular benzimidazole can affect the
pharmacokinetic behaviour  of  the drug  through changes  in  relative
insolubility, slowing the elimination of the parent drug and/or active
metabolites. The greater efficacy, and wider spectrum of activity, of the
most recently introduced (second-generation) benzimidazoles appears to
be due to the relative insolubility of these chemicals, which affects the
absorption, transport and excretion of the anthelmintic compound from the
host.

tubulin, a constituent protein present in microtubules and in plasma and
mitochondrial membranes. The formation of microtubules is a dynamic
process involving the polymerisation of tubulin rings at one end and
depolymerisation at the other end. Benzimidazole anthelmintics bind to
B-tubulin causing capping and inhibition of further microtubule formation.
The resultant effect is starvation of the parasite due to inhibition of
glucose uptake, protein secretion and microtubule production. There is

It appears to have no tubulin-binding properties, unlike other members of
this group, and it must therefore act along alternative pathways.
Benzimidazoles have a low toxicity, and in some cases can be used at over
ten times the recommended dose rate. Parasite resistance to anthelmintics
has most frequently been associated with repeated use of these drugs
against nematodes of sheep, goats and horses and in many countries has
limited both their effectiveness and use.
MIDAZOTHIAZOLESY
TETRAHYDROPYRIMIDINES
The imidathiazole group contains two members, tetramisole and
levamisole. Tetramisole is a racemic mixture of dextro and levo forms
Levamisole is the levo-isomer and it is with this form that anthelmintic
potency resides. The dose rate of levamisole is therefore half that of
tetramisole, and it has twice the safety index.
Levamisole is used mainly in cattle and sheep and has good activity
against a range of gastrointestinal nematodes and is also highly effective
against lungworms. Levamisole can be administered orally, by injection or
1778
(oxyclozanide or triclabendazole) to form a broad-spectrum drench for
worms and fluke. Unlike the benzimidazoles it is not ovicidal. Levamisole
is non-teratogenic and is therefore safe to use in pregnant animals. The
therapeutic index in relation to other anthelmintics is, however, low.
Animals given levamisole may be hyperactive for a few minutes after
receiving the recommended therapeutic dose. Toxic signs, due to a
stimulant effect on nerve ganglia, may manifest as salivation, bradycardia,
 s        
Injectable levamisole may cause inflammation at the site of injection.
The drug is rapidly absorbed and excreted, most of the dose being lost
from the system within 24 hours of administration. Because of the mode
of action of these compounds nematode paralysis occurs quickly and
removal of the worms is rapid. In addition to its anthelmintic properties,
levamisole has been shown to stimulate the mammalian immune system
by  increasing cellular    activity.  The  relationship    between   the
immunostimulatory and nematocidal properties of levamisole is unknown.
Pyrantel and morantel are members of the tetrahydropyrimidine group.
Morantel is used for the treatment of gastrointestinal worms of cattle and
sheep but is not effective against mucosal or arrested stages or against
established lungworm infections. Like levamisole, it has no activity
against tapeworms and fluke. Pyrantel is used for the treatment and
control of nematode and tapeworm infections in horses and nematodes in
dogs. It is also active against nematodes in ruminants and pigs. Pyrantel
salts (tartrate or pamoate) are active against adult and larval stages of large
and small strongyles, ascarids, tapeworms (Anoplocephala) at double the
regular dose, and benzimidazole-resistant strains of cyathostomes in the
horse.
None of these drugs are particularly toxic and they can be used safely in
pregnant and young animals.
The mode of action of these compounds appears to be as selective
agonists, mimicking the action of acetylcholine (Ach), causing a rapid,
reversible spastic paralysis. Paralysed worms are expelled by normal gut
peristalsis.
1779
AVERMECTINS/MILBEMYCINS
These are a series of macrocyclic lactone derivatives, which are
fermentation products of the actinomycete Streptomyces avermitilis
(avermectins)andStreptomyces
Cyanogriseus (milbemycins)
on the lactone ring, whilst milbemycins differ from the avermectins
through the absence of a sugar moiety from the lactone skeleton. The
avermectins include abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin  and
ivermectin, and are active against a wide range of nematodes and
arthropods. Moxidectin is a milbemycin and has a similar wide-ranging
activity.
The macrocyclic lactones have been shown to have excellent activity, at
very low dose rates, not only against a wide range of nematodes, but also
against certain arthropod parasites and hence are sometimes referred to as
endectocides. They are active against adult and larval gastrointestinal
roundworms and lungworms of ruminants, horses and pigs, although none
of these compounds have activity against tapeworms or liver fluke.
Avermectins are also active against filarial worms (Parafilaria) in cattle.
microfilariae of the canine heartworm (Dirofilaria) in dogs and spiruroid
worms, including Habronema and Draschsia, in horses.
The ectoparasites these compounds have activity against include warbles
(Hypoderma spp) in cattle, sucking lice (Haematopinus, Linognathus,
Selenopotes spp) and mange mites (Psoroptes, Sarcoptes, Chorioptes) in
cattle, sheep and pigs. More detailed information on the efficacy of the
endectocides against ectoparasites is provided  in the section  on
ectoparasiticides.
   r n d e s  i 
and is effective against hookworms (Ancyfostoma, Uncinaria) and ascarid
roundworms (Toxocara, Toxascaris) in dogs and cats. Selamectin has
been specifically developed for use in dogs and cats and is also active
against fleas and mites in these hosts (see Ectoparasiticides)
Macrocyclic lactones are highly lipophilic and, following administration.
are stored in fat tissue from where they are slowly released, metabolised
and excreted. Ivermectin is absorbed systemically following oral,
subcutaneous or dermal administration, but is absorbed to a greater
degree, and has a longer halflife, when given subcutaneously or dermally.

       i   sde o on 
is a slow release. Excretion of the unaltered molecule is mainly via the
faeces with less than 2% excreted in the urine. The reduced absorption and
bioavailability of ivermectin when given orally in ruminants may be due
to its metabolism in the rumen. The affinity of these compounds to fat
explains their persistence in the body and the extended periods of
protection afforded against lungworms and stomach worms in cattle and
sheep. Individual  variances  in  these  periods  of protection  reflect
differences in drug distribution, metabolism and excretion. In cattle.
injectable and pour-on preparations provide protection for up to 42 days
for lungworms and 35 days for stomach worms depending on the product
and formulation. The prolonged half-life of these compounds also
determines levels of residues in meat and milk, and subsequent
compulsory withdrawal periods following treatment. With the exception
of eprinomectin, which has a zero milk withdrawal period, treatment with
this class of compounds cannot be given to lactating cattle, or during the
last2monthsof pregnancy
Their mode of action has been studied but has still not been completely
elucidated. Ivermectin is known to act on y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
neurotransmission at two or more sites in nematodes, blocking
interneuronal stimulation of excitatory motor neurones and thus leading to
a flaccid paralysis. It appears to achieve this by stimulating the release of
   o      u  
receptor on the post-synaptic membrane of an excitatory motor neurone.
The enhanced GABA binding results in an increased flow of chloride ions
(Cl ) into the cell leading to hyperpolarisation. In mammals, GABA
neurotransmission is confined to the central nervous system; the lack of
effect of avermectin on the mammalian nervous system at therapeutic
concentrations is probably because, being a large molecule, it does not
readily cross the blood-brain barrier. More recent evidence suggests that
ivermectin may exert its effect through action on glutamate-gated Cl
SALICYLANILIDESSUBSTITUTEDPHENOLS
The salicylanilides/substituted phenols can be regarded as close analogues
and include the bromsalans, clioxanide, oxyclozanide, brotianide,
niclosamide, rafoxanide and closantel (salicylanilides), nitroxynil,
1781
disophenol,
， bithionol,  hexachlorophene,
，niclofolan(phenol
derivatives). With the exception of niclosamide, the salicylanilides and
substituted phenols are usually marketed as flukicides for cattle and sheep,
being highly effective against adult, and to a lesser extent, immature
flukes (Fasciola). Some also possess activity against bloodsucking
nematodes such as Haemonchus. Disophenol has been used for treatment
of dogs infected with hookworms, and is also effective against mature H.

benzimidazole-resistant H. contortus infections. Niclosamide is highly
effective against tapeworms in cattle, sheep, horses, poultry and possibly
against immature paramphistomes in ruminants. In a number of countries,
plasma proteins (>99%), which may explain their high eficacy against
blood-feeding parasites. Fasciolicidal activity is dependent on the extent to
long plasma half-lives when compared with oxyclozanide. Evidence
suggests that the apparent efficacy of these drugs, particularly against
immature fluke (Fasciola), may be due more to their persistence in the
plasma and the effect they have on maturing adult flukes when they reach
the bile ducts, rather than the effect they have on the immature stages
themselves. Young flukes probably ingest mainly liver cells, which
they cause extensive haemorrhage and come into contact with
contact with even greater concentrations of anthelmintic as the bile ducts
are important in the excretion of these compounds, as evidenced by the
high proportion of these, and their metabolites, excreted in the faeces
rather than the urine.
Salicylanilides   and   substituted    phenols   uncouple   oxidative
phosphorylation and therefore decrease the availability of high-energy
phosphate compounds such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced
nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NADH) in the mitochondria. They
have also been shown to inhibit succinate dehydrogenase activity and the
fumarate reductase system, which is associated with oxidative
phosphorylation. Because of the long half-life of the plasma protein-bound
molecules, the parasites experience prolonged exposure to the drugs,
which reduces the energy available to the parasites.

uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation, i.e. hyperventilation, hyperthermia,
convulsions, tachycardia and ultimately death.
Dichlorophen is a chlorinated phenol and is active against tapeworms
(Dipylidium, Taenia) in dogs and cats. Its mode of action is thought to be
similar to that of the salicyclanides, interfering with oxidative
phosphorylation.
PIPERAZINES
Piperazine salts are widely used against ascarids, particularly in dogs and
cats, and act as GABA agonists, producing paralysis. Piperazine adipate
has been widely used in horses and is effective against adult stages of
small strongyles and Parascaris. In pigs, the drug is active against Ascaris
and nodular worms Oesophagostomum spp after a single treatment.
Diethylcarbamazine is still marketed in certain parts of the world for the
treatment of lungworm infections in cattle. It is primarily active against
immature lungworms and because it has to be given over a period of 3
days to achieve its effect, it has been replaced by more modern
anthelmintics. The action of diethylcarbamazine on immature lungworm
larvae is thought to be a ‘flaccid’ paralysis due to hyperpolarisation of
neuronal post-synaptic membranes resulting from an increased flow of Cl
          l  e

dying or dead microfilariae following treatment. It has also been reported
to be effective against the lungworm Crenosoma vuipis of dogs and
farmed foxes.
1783
ORGANOPHOSPHATES
Several organophosphorus compounds (see ectoparasiticides) are active
against nematodes, but are becoming less widely available in many
countries. Compounds used in the treatment of nematode infections
include coumaphos, trichlorophon, haloxon and dichlorvos. They act
by inhibiting cholinesterase resulting in a build-up of acetylcholine, which
leads to neuromuscular paralysis of nematodes and their expulsion. This
group of drugs is relatively toxic and has been used most frequently in
horses, because of the additional insecticidal action against larvae of horse
bots.
Coumaphos has been widely used as an ectoparasitic in livestock. It
exhibits a cumulative effect on trichostrongyle nematodes if given in feed
daily for l week; there is a good activity against Haemonchus spp and
  ss i        o
Trichostrongyius,  Ostertagia   spp   and   Oesophagostomum
spp
Anthelmintic activity can be enhanced if the drench passes via the closed
Oesophageal groove directly to the abomasum either with sodium
bicarbonate in cattle, or copper sulphate in sheep. It is also effective
against Capillaria, Ascaridia and Heterakis in chickens. The drug is toxic
and may cause mortality in ruminants. Coloured breeds of egg-laying hens
are more susceptible to the drug than white breeds and birds should not be
treated while they are in lay.
Haloxon is still used in many countries for treatment of nematodes. In
cattle, sheep and goats, there is good activity against adult Haemonchus;
also Cooperia spp in sheep and Neoascaris in cattle. There is a moderate
effect against Ostertagia,Bunostomum,
Trichostrongyfusand
Oesophagostomum but little effect against Nematodirus, Trichuris and
Chabertia. It is highly effective against adult stages of Strongylus
vuigaris, most small strongyles (also benzimidazole-resistant strains),
Parascaris and Oxyuris in the horse.Haloxon is also effective against
Capillaria infections of birds (chicken, turkey, quail and pigeons) but is
ineffective against Heterakis. In pigs, it is active against adult Ascaris and
paralysis). It is used in some countries in chickens, turkeys, quail and
pigeons against Capillaria. The recommended dose range for birds
(50-100 mg/kg) is lethal for geese and possibly waterfowl.
1784
Trichlorophon is effective against adult and immature Parascaris, adult
pinworms (Oxyuris) and against bots (larvae of Gasterophilus) and, at
higher doses, large strongyles (S. vuigaris) and small strongyles in horses.
benzimidazoles,  pyrantel  pamoate or  piperazine/phenothiazine for
removal of ascarids, pinworms, small strongyles (cyathostomes) and all
three species of large strongyles. It shows good efficacy against adults of
Ascaris, Trichuris and Hyostrongylus in pigs. At therapeutic doses, there
may be mild adverse effects such as transient softening of faeces and mild
colic for several hours.
Dichlorvos has a similar spectrum of activity to trichlorophon in horses
and pigs; formulation in a slow-release resin increases activity against
large and small strongyles and safety in pigs. However, the resin pellets,
which appear in the faeces, are toxic to other animals, especially chickens.
ARSENICALS
Thiocetarsamide is an arsenical compound that has been used for many
dogs. Its efficacy varies depending on the sex and age of worm, and there
is a risk to treated animals of pulmonary embolism in the first month
following treatment. The drug is highly irritant to subcutaneous tissues
and is both hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic with mortality during or
following therapy related to the degree of clinical manifestation of
heartworm disease. It is now no longer available.
Melarsomine dihydrochloride is a new generation arsenical adulticide
that can be used for treatment of canine heartworm disease. It is less
        
efficacy using a two-dose strategy. It is generally well tolerated causing
only minor tissue reactions and is normally administered intramuscularly
into the lumbar muscles.
OTHERDRUGS
Phenothiazine was the first broad-spectrum anthelmintic used for several
 i   si l    s i  s
1785
for treating benzimidazole-resistant strains of small strongyles. The drug
is active against adult stages of small strongyles but has little or no effect
on large strongyles, immature stages of small strongyles and Parascaris.
At therapeutic doses there may be side effects, such as anorexia, muscular
weakness, icterus or anaemia, but seldom mortality.
against tapeworm infections in dogs and cats. It is generally formulated
and administered with pyrantel pamoate to give a broader range of activity
against both roundworms and tapeworms of dogs and cats.
Praziquantel is an aceylated quinoline-pyrazine and is active against a
dose rates against tapeworms of ruminants. It is the drug of choice against
multilocular echinococcosis (Echinococcus muitilocuiaris) and is also
   () s   s
(Nanophyetus)in dogs. Praziquantelmodulates cell membrane
permeability causing spastic paralysis of muscle cells in the parasite and,
like a number of other cestodicidal drugs, causes damage to the parasite
tegument.
Nitroscanate is marketed for treatment of common roundworm and
tapeworm infections of dogs. Although active in cats its use in this species
is contraindicated due to adverse side effects including posterior paralysis,
inappetence and vomiting.
Emodepside is a semi-synthetic compound belonging to a new group of
chemicals called the depsipeptides. The compound acts at the
against roundworms of dogs and cats.
PROPERTIESOFANTHELMINTIC
COMPOUNDS
1.It should be efficient against all parasitic stages ofa
particular species. It is also generally desirable that the spectrum
of activity should include members of different genera, for example
1786
in dealing with the equine strongyles and Parascaris equorum.
However in some circumstances, separate drugs have to be used at
different times of year to control infections with unrelated
gastroenteritis and the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica are examples.
2. It is important that any anthelmintic should be nontoxic to the
host, or at least have a wide safety margin. This is especially
important in the treatment of groups of animals such as a flock of
sheep, where individual body weights cannot easily be obtained,
rather than in the dosing of individual companion animals such as
catsordogs
3. In general, an anthelmintic should be rapidly cleared and
necessary in meat-and milk-producing animals. However, in certain
used to prophylactic advantage, for example the use of closantel to
control Haemonchus in sheep.
4. Anthelmintics should be easily administered, otherwise they
will not be readily accepted by owners; different formulations are
available for different domestic animal species. Oral and injectable
products are widely used in ruminants, and pour-on preparations are
cattle and sheep. Palatable in-feed and paste formulations are
        
available as tablets for dogs and cats.
5. The cost of an anthelmintic should be reasonable. This is of
special importance in pigs and poultry where profit margins may be
narrow.
USEOFANTHELMINTICS
Anthelmintics are generally used in two ways: therapeutically, to treat
existing infections or clinical outbreaks, or prophylactically, in which the
prophylactic use is preferable where administration of a drug at selected
intervals or continuously over a period can prevent the occurrence of
disease.
1787
THERAPEUTICUSAGE
When used therapeutically, the following factors should be considered:
·If the drug is not active against all stages it must be effective
against the pathogenic stage of the parasite.
·Use of the anthelmintic should, by successfully removing parasites.
result in cessation of clinical signs of infection, such as diarrhoea
and respiratory distress; in other words, there should be a marked
clinical improvement and rapid recovery after treatment.
PROPHYLACTIC USAGE
Several points should be considered where anthelmintics are used
prophylactically:
· The cost of prophylactic treatment should be justifiable
economically, by increased production in food animals, or by
preventing the occurrence of clinical or subclinical disease in, for
example, horses with strongylosis or dogs with heartworm disease.
· The cost-benefit of anthelmintic prophylaxis should stand
comparison with the control, which can be achieved by other
methods such as pasture management or, for example, in the case of
dictyocaulosis, by vaccination.
 It is desirable that the use of anthelmintics should not interfere with
the development of an acquired immunity, since there are reports of
outbreaks of disease in older stock, which have been overprotected
by control measures during their earlier years.
· Prolonged prophylactic use of one drug should be avoided as this
may encourage the development of anthelmintic resistance.
METHODSOFADMINISTRATION
usually by subcutaneous injection. Oral administration is common by
drenching with liquids or suspensions, or by the incorporation of the drug
in the feed or water for farm animals and by the administration of tablets
to small animals. More recently, paste formulations have been introduced
especially for horses and there are now several compounds which have
1788
systemic action when applied as pour-on or spot-on formulations to the
skin. Methods for injecting compounds directly into the rumen of cattle
have also been marketed. A number of rumen-dwelling boluses are
available, mainly for cattle, and to a lesser extent for sheep. These are
designed to deliver therapeutic doses of anthelmintic at intervals
(pulse-release) or low doses over prolonged periods (sustained-release);
both prevent the establishment of mature parasite populations and thus
limit the contamination of pastures and the occurrence of disease. An
apparatus for the delivery of anthelmintics into drinking water at daily or
 periodic intervals has also been developed.
Some products are marketed for cattle and sheep consisting of a mixture
of a roundworm anthelmintic and a fluke drug, but the timing of
treatments for roundworms or flukes, whether curative or prophylactic, is
often different and the requirement for such combination compounds is
therefore limited.
ECTOPARASITICIDES
(INSECTICIDES/
ACARICIDES)
The control of the ectoparasites found on animals, including fleas, lice,
ticks, mange mites, warbles and nuisance flies, is largely based on the use
of chemicals. There is a vast world market in these chemicals, with
ECTOPARASITICIDESANDTHEIR
MODE OF ACTION
Three main chemical groupings have been used as the basis for the
common ectoparasiticides: the organochlorines, the organophosphates and
the synthetic pyrethroids. Other groups that are also used include the
carbamates (primarily in poultry), the formamidines, the triazines, benzyl
1789
benzoate and natural plant products such as pyrethrin. The avermectins
and milbemycins have also been shown to have a high activity against a
range of ectoparasites and these are increasingly used for ectoparasite
control, for example mange in sheep, cattle and pigs. There are also
compounds which affect the growth and development of insects. Based on
their mode of action they can be divided into chitin inhibitors, chitin
synthesis inhibitors and juvenile hormone analogues. Insect growth
regulators (IGRs) are widely used for flea control in domestic pets and for
blowfly control in sheep but have limited use in other host species. For
example, lufenuron blocks the formation of larval chitin in fleas, and
cyromazine disrupts growth regulation in blowfly larvae on sheep.
ORGANOCHLORINES(OCS)
Organochlorines are now banned in many countries on the grounds of
both human and environmental safety. OCs fall into three main groups:
·Chiorinated
ethane
derivatives.
Includes
DDT
(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane),
DDE
(dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane)
andDDD(dicofol,
methoxychlor). Chlorinated ethanes cause inhibition of sodium
 q s u   oss e a
sodium channels open, resulting in delayed repolarisation of the
axonal membrane. This state renders the nerve vulnerable to
repetitive discharge from small stimuli that would normally cause
an action potential in a fully repolarised neurone.
Cyciodienes. The cyclodienes include chlordane, aldrin, dieldrin.
hepatochlor, endrin and tozaphene. They appear to have at least two
component modes of action; inhibition of y-amino butyric acid
(GABA) stimulated Cl flux and interference with calcium ion
(Ca2+ ) flux. The resultant inhibitory post-synaptic potential leads
to a state of partial depolarisation of the post-synaptic membrane
and vulnerability to repeated discharge.
Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH). Includes benzene hexachloride
(BHC) and its y-isomer, lindane. The mode of action is similar to
the cyclodienes with the drug binding to the picrotoxin side of the
GABA receptor resulting in an inhibition of GABA-dependent Cl-
flux into the neurone.
1790
DDT and BHC were used extensively for flystrike control but were
subsequently replaced in many countries by more effective cyclodiene
compounds, dieldrin and aldrin. DDT and lindane (BHC) were widely
organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroids have largely replaced them
They have the advantage that the effect of the drug persists for a longer
food animals, is that they persist in animal tissues. If toxicity occurs the
signs are those of central nervous system (CNS) stimulation with
hypersensitivity, followed by increasing muscular spasm progressing to
convulsions.
ORGANOPHOSPHATES(OPS)
These include a vast number of compounds of which chlorfenvinphos,
coumaphos,crotoxyphos,
crufomate,  cythioate,  diazinon,
dichlofenthion, dichlorvos, fenthion, iodofenphos, malathion,
phosmet, propetamphos, ronnel, tetrachlorvinphos and trichlorphon
have been amongst the most commonly used. These can persist in the
animals' coat or fleece for reasonable periods, but residues in animal
tissues are short lived. Some have the ability to act systemically, given
parenterally, orally or as a pour-on, but the effective blood levels of these
are maintained for only 24 hours. The OPs are cholinesterase inhibitors; if
acute toxicity occurs, the signs are salivation, dyspnoea, incoordination,
muscle tremors and sometimes diarrhoea. There is also concern over
chronic toxicity which may be associated with the use of these compounds
and which is thought to be the result of inhibition of the enzyme
neurotoxicesterase.
SYNTHETICPYRETHROIDS(SPS)
The common SPs in use include deltamethrin, permethiin,
cypermethrin, flumethrin and fenvalerate. The main value of these
compounds lies in their repellent effect and since they persist well on the
coat or skin, but not in tissue, they are of particular value against parasites
which feed on the skin surface, such as lice, some mites and nuisance
flies. Pyrethroids act as neurotoxins upon sensory and motor nerves of the
neuroendocrine and CNS of insects. All the pyrethroids are lipophilic and
this property helps them to act as contact insecticides. Some have the
1791
ability to repel and to ^knockdown', i.e. affect flight and balance without
causing complete paralysis. Because the SPs have a strong affinity for
             
occur it is expressed in the peripheral nervous system as hypersensitivity
and muscle tremors. SPs are also extremely toxic to fish and aquatic
invertebrates and there are environmental concerns over their use.
CARBAMATES
Carbamate insecticides are closely related to the organophosphates (OPs)
and are anticholinesterases, but unlike OP compounds they appear to
cause a spontaneously reversible block on the enzyme acetylcholinesterase
(AchE) without changing it. The two main carbamate compounds in use in
veterinary medicine are carbaryl and propoxur, with butocarb and
carbanolate also used in the control of poultry ectoparasites. Carbaryl has
low mammalian toxicity but may be carcinogenic and is often combined
with other active ingredients. Fenoxycarb is used for flea control and
appears to have a mode of action closely related to the juvenile hormone
analogues, preventing embryonic development in flea eggs, larval
been formulated with permethrin or chlorpyrifos for use on animals or in
liquid concentrate form for environmental flea control.
AVERMECINS/MILBEMYCINS
These are effective at very low dose levels against certain ectoparasites
  d ud a  d ai 
particularly effective against ectoparasites with tissue stages, such as
warbles, bots and mites, and have good activity against bloodsucking
parasites such as lice and one-host ticks. As in nematodes, they are
thought to affect cell function by direct action in Cl channels. They have
a very wide safety margin. Some avermectins have a marked residual
effect and a single treatment given parenterally is still effective against
lice or mites hatching from eggs 3-4 weeks later.
         
(Ctenocephalides) and prevents flea infestations on dogs and cats for a
1792
period of 30 days. It is safe and effective in controlling mite (Otodectes,
Sarcoptes) and tick (Rhipicephalus) infestations.
FORMAMIDINES
The main member of this group is amitraz, which acts at octopamine
receptor sites in ectoparasites resulting in neuronal hyperexcitability and
death. It is available as a spray or dip for use against mites, lice and ticks
in domestic livestock. In cattle, for example, it has been widely used in
pue isou-aluis jo lonuon aun rog sunjnoy uo-nod no sheds 'sdi
multi-host tick species. In dipping baths, it can be stabilised by the
addition of calcium hydroxide, and maintained by standard replenishment
methods for routine tick control. An alternative method has been the use
with the full concentration of amitraz at weekly intervals prior to use.
Amitraz has also been shown to have an expellent action against attached
ticks. It has been shown to be effective on controlling lice and mange in
pigs and psoroptic mange in sheep.
treatment and control of ticks, and for canine demodicosis (Demodex) and
sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes). Amitraz is contraindicated in horses and in
pregnant or nursing bitches and cats, although it has been used at a
reduced concentration to treat feline demodicosis. Amitraz is also
formulated in collars for tick control in dogs.
PHENYLPYRAZOLES
Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole compound which blocks transmission of
signals by the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, present in insects. The
compound binds within the Cl channel and consequently inhibits the
flux of Cl  ions into the nerve cell resulting in hyperexcitation of the
insect nervous system. Fipronil is used worldwide for the treatment and
control of flea and tick infestations on dogs and cats and has reported
activity against mange mites (Sarcoptes), ear mites (Otodectes), forage
mites (Trombicula, Cheyletiella) and dog lice (Trichodectes). It is highly
lipophilic and diffuses into the sebaceous glands of hair follicles that then
act as a reservoir giving it a long residual activity. Sunlight, immersion in
        
1793
products containing this compound. There is evidence that fipronil has an
extremely rapid knock-down effect which occurs before the fleas have
dermatitis.
NTROGUANIDINESANDSPINOSYNS
Imidacloprid is a chloronicotinyl insecticide, a synthesised chlorinated
derivative of nicotine. It specifically binds to nicotinic acetylcholine (Ach)
receptors in the insect's CNS, leading to inhibition of cholinergic
transmission resulting in paralysis and death. This mode of action is the
same as nicotine, which has been used as a natural insecticide for
centuries. The favourable selective toxicity of imidacloprid appears to be
due to the fact that it only seems to bind to the Ach receptors of insects,
having no effect on these receptors in mammals. Its activity appears to be
mainly confined to insect parasites and it is available as a spot-on product
in many countries for use in dogs and cats for the control of adult fleas
providing protection against reinfestation for up to 45 weeks.
Spinosad  is a  fermentation product of  the soil actinomycete,
Saccaropolyspora spinosa, and has been developed in some countries for
INSECT GROWTH REGULATORS
Several IGRs are used throughout the world, and represent a relatively
growth and development. IGRs act mainly on immature stages of the
parasite and as such are not usually suitable for the rapid control of
established adult populations of parasites. Where parasites show a clear
a preventative measure.
Based on their mode of action they can be divided into chitin synthesis
inhibitors (benzoylphenyl ureas), chitin inhibitors (triazine/pyrimidine
derivatives) and juvenile hormone analogues. [GRs are widely used for
flea control in domestic pets and for blowfly control in sheep but have
limited use in other host species.
1794
Benzoylphenyl ureas
The benzoylphenyl ureas (diflubenzuron, flufenoxuron, fluaxuron,
lufenuron and triflumuron) are chitin inhibitors, of which several have
been introduced for the control of ectoparasites of veterinary importance.
Chitin is a complex aminopolysaccharide and a major component of the
 g u q o s    a a s
polymerisation of individual sugar molecules. Chitin molecules, together
with proteins are assembled into chains, which in turn are assembled into
microfibrils. The exact mode of action of the benzoylphenyl ureas is not
fully understood. They inhibit chitin synthesis but have no effect on the
with the assembly of the chitin chains into microfibrils. When immature
insect stages are exposed to these compounds they are not able to
complete ecdysis and as a consequence die during the moulting process.
Benzyl phenylureas also appear to show a transovarial effect. Exposed
adult female insects produce eggs in which the compound is incorporated
developed larvae are incapable of hatching. Benzoylphenyl ureas show a
efficacy against ticks and mites. The exception to this is fluazuron, which
has greater activity against ticks and some mite species.
Benzoylphenyl ureas are highly lipophilic molecules and, when
administered to the host, build up in the body fat from where they are
slowly released into the bloodstream and excreted largely unchanged.
Diflubenzuron and flufenoxuron are used for the prevention of blowfly
strike in sheep. Diflubenzuron is available in some countries as an
emulsifiable concentrate for use as a dip or shower. [t is more efficient
against first-stage larvae than second and third instars and is therefore
recommended as a preventative, providing 12-14 weeks’ protection. It
may also have potential for the control of a number of major insect pests
     
cattle as a tick development inhibitor. When applied as a pour-on it
provides long-term protection against the one-host tick, Boophilus
micropius.
Lufenuron is administered orally and is used for the control of fleas of
dogs and cats. The drug accumulates in fat tissue allowing subsequent
slow release. Fleas take up the drug through the blood and transfer it to
1795
their eggs, which are non-viable within 24 hours of administration. The
formation of larval chitin structures is blocked, thereby inhibiting the
development of flea larvae and providing environmental control of the flea
population. For oral administration, the drug must be administered in the
food to allow sufficient time for absorption from the stomach. Injectable
treatment is given at 6-monthly intervals whilst oral treatment is given
once monthly during summer, commencing 2 months before fleas become
active. As lufenuron has no activity against adult fleas, an insecticide
treatment may be required if there is an initial heavy infestation or in cases
of severe hypersensitivity.
Triflumuron is active against lice and fleas in dogs
Triazine/pyrimidine derivatives
Triazine and pyrimidine derivatives are closely related compounds that are

deposition of chitin into the cuticle rather than its synthesis.
Cyromazine, a triazine derivative, is effective against blowfly larvae on
sheep and lambs and also against other Diptera, such as houseflies,
mosquitoes, etc. At recommended dose rates, cyromazine shows only
limited activity against established strikes and must therefore be used
preventatively before anticipated challenge. Blowflies lay eggs usually on
damp fleece of treated sheep. Although larvae are able to hatch out, the
young larvae immediately come into contact with cyromazine, which
prevents the moult to second instars. The use of a *pour-on’ preparation of
cyromazine has the advantage that efficacy is not dependent upon factors
addition, the persistence of the drug is such that control can be maintained
for up to 13 weeks after a single pour-on application, or longer if applied
by dip or shower.
Dicyelanil, a pyrimidine derivative, is highly active against dipteran
larvae and is available as a pour-on formulation for blowfly control in
sheep in some countries, providing up to 20 weeks protection.

Juvenilehormone analogues
The juvenile hormone analogues mimic the activity of naturally occurring
juvenile hormones and prevent metamorphosis to the adult stage. Once the
destroy endogenous juvenile hormones, and final development occurs to
the adult stage. The juvenile hormone analogues bind to juvenile hormone
receptor sites, but because they are structurally different are not destroyed
by insect esterases. As a consequence, metamorphosis and further
development to the adult stage does not proceed.
Methoprene is a terpenoid compound with very low mammalian toxicity
that mimics a juvenile insect hormone and is regularly used for flea
control. It is sensitive to light and will not persist outdoors. It has been
used extensively and successfully in indoor environments and on pets in
the form of collars, shampoos, sprays and dips and also as a feed through
larvicide for hornfly (Haematobia) control on cattle. The other member of
MISCELLANEOUSCOMPOUNDS
Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is a methylnedioxphenyl compound that has
been widely used as a synergistic additive in the control of arthropod
pests. It is commonly used as a synergist with natural pyrethrins, the
combination having a much greater insecticidal activity than the natural
product alone. The degree of potentiation of insecticidal activity is related
to the ratio of components in the mixture, such that as the proportion of
PBO increases, so the amount of natural pyrethrins required to evoke the
same level of kill decreases. The insecticidal activity of other pyrethroids.
particularly of knockdown agents, can also be enhanced by the addition of
PBO. The enhancement of activity of synthetic pyrethroids is normally
less dramatic but PBO may be included in several formulations. PBO

sprays, foggers, washes, dips and occasionally used in baits to trap insects.
However, with the advent of pour-on and spot-on formulations with a
systemic effect, the parenteral administration of drugs such as the
avermectins and closantel and the use of impregnated ear tags, collars and
tail-tags, the methodology of control applications to animals has changed.
Traditional methods

insecticide are used to control mites, lice and ticks and certain dipterans
such as blowflies on sheep on a worldwide basis and on cattle in tropical
areas. This technique is more successful in sheep where the persistence of
insecticide is greater in the wool fleece than in the hair coat found in
cattle. It is important to remember that the concentration of insecticide in a

pyrethroids. Despite human and environmental safety concerns, some
countries have reintroduced organochlorines because of developing
resistance to organophosphates.
Insect control in dairies or stables may be aided by the use of various
resins strips incorporating the insecticide; dichlorvos and trichlorfon are
often used for this purpose. Sometimes baits containing synthetic
pheromones, sugars or hydrolysed yeasts, plus insecticide are spread
around animal premises to attract and kill dipterans.
Pour-on,spot-onorspray-on
Those available at present contain organophosphates with a systemic
synthetic pyrethroids. They are recommended for the control of warbles
and lice in cattle and lice and keds in sheep. A valuable development is
cattle. A single treatment in pigs gives very good results and, if used in
sows prior to farrowing, prevents transmission to the litter; two treatments
at an interval of 14 days are necessary in cattle. The synthetic pyrethroids

the organophosphates. They are recommended for the protection of cattle
against nuisance flies. The tags are usually made of polyvinylchloride
impregnated with the insecticide. When attached to an animal's ear the
insecticide is released from the surface, dissolves in the sebum secreted by
actions or ear flapping and tail swishing as well as by bodily contact
between cattle. As the insecticide is rapidly bonded to the sebum on the
animal's coat the treatment is rain-fast; also the tag or tail band continues
to release a supply of chemical under all climatic conditions. Since the
drugs are located in the sebum, they are not absorbed into the tissue so
there is no need for a withdrawal period prior to slaughter, nor is it
necessary to discard milk. The common SPs marketed for this purpose are
cypermethrin and permethrin. Under conditions of heavy fly challenge a

Parenteral treatment
The avermectins/milbemycins and closantel may be given parenterally to
control some ectoparasites. For example, the endectocides have good
activity against warbles, lice, many mites and also the one-host tick
Boophiius. Closantel is available in some tropical countries for use against
one-host ticks and sucking lice.
COMPANION ORPETANIMALS
Ectoparasiticides are mainly used as dusting powders, aerosols, washes/
shampoos, spot-on preparations and impregnated collars, whilst some are
available for oral use. They are mainly used for the control of fleas, lice
and mange in dogs and cats and for lice, mange and nuisance flies in
horses.
Dusting powders
The powders should be shaken well into the animal's fur or hair and, in
the case of house pets, into the bedding. The powders commonly used
contain pyrethroid-based insecticides with or without the synergist,
piperonyl butoxide. These are particularly useful for fleas and lice and
repeat treatments are generally recommended every 2-3 weeks.
Aerosols
Although easy to use, some of the noisier sprays can upset pets.
Overzealous spraying in confined spaces, such as in a cat basket, may
produce toxic effects. Sprays available are generally based on pyrethroids
and carbamates or a mixture of organophosphates such as dichlorvos plus
fenitrothion, or a mixture of the synergist piperonyl butoxide with OPs or
pyrethroids. Depending on the spray, the aerosol container should be held
at 15-30 cm from the animal and sprayed for up to 5 seconds for cats and
a little longer for dogs. A repeat treatment is often recommended in 7-14
days; but only one spray application with fipronil can give up to 3 months?

which are responsible for 'sweet-itch'.
Aerosols containing the insect growth regulator, methoprene, are available
for the control of larval populations of fleas in the environment.
Baths
These are available as shampoos, emulsifiable concentrates, wettable
agents or creams for the control of fleas, lice and mange mites. Most
preparations are for dogs and care is needed if they are used for cats.
Common ingredients are carbaryl, propoxur and the OP phosmet; amitraz
is particularly useful for demodectic mange in dogs. The instructions for
bathing should be carefully followed and, where necessary, care taken that
the insecticide is properly rinsed from the coat. Organophosphate
shampoos should not be used when dogs have insecticidal collars.
Insecticidalcollars
These are used primarily  for flea control and are based on the
Organophosphates, carbamates and synthetic pyrethroids. The period of
protection is claimed to be 3-4 months, but the success of this method of
application is variable. Occasional problems arise from contact dermatitis
organophosphate treatments. Apart from collars, impregnated medallions
are also available in some countries. Care should be taken with the use of
collars in pedigree long-haired cats and greyhound dogs due to individual
susceptibility to OP poisoning.
Collars have also been introduced containing deltamethrin for the control
of biting flies, including sandflies, as a means of prevention of infection
with transmissible diseases such as leishmaniosis.
Oralpreparations
One organophosphate, cythioate, is marketed as an oral preparation. It is
specifically for the treatment of demodectic mange and flea infestations in
dogs and flea infestation in cats; the daily administration of tablets is
rec ommended as a supplement to topical application.
1801
Other preparations
Spot-on preparations containing fenthion, deltamethrin, fipronil,
imidocloprid, emodepside and selamectin are now available for the control
of fleas, and in some cases ticks, on dogs and cats. In horses, lice and
areas of mange mite infestation can be treated topically, but the problem
impregnated with cypermethrin be attached to the saddle or mane as a
possible means of incorporating the synthetic pyrethroid into the sebum.
POULTRYECTOPARASITES
The carbamates and the organophosphate, malathion, are the most widely
used. Individual birds are dusted and the insecticide applied in the poultry
house, nesting boxes and litter. Cypermethrin is available for the
environmental treatment of poultry red mites (Dermanyssus).
ANTIPROTOZOALS
Unlike other antiparasitic agents, for which a few chemical structural
classes exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activity, antiprotozoal
activity exists in a wide spectrum of chemical classes, each of which
possess only a narrow spectrum of activity. The classification of
antiprotozoal compounds is complex and for the purposes of this chapter
they are divided into eight main groups, each of which may be further
subdivided on the basis of structural similarities.
ANTIPROTOZOALSANDTHEIR
MODEOF ACTION
ANTIMONIALSANDARSENICALS
Antimonials contain the group V metal, antimony, and have been used
extensively for the treatment of leishmaniosis. The antimonials selectively
1802
inhibit enzymes that are required for glycolytic and fatty acid oxidation in
tissue amastigotes found within macrophages.
Tartar emetic (antimony potassium tartrate) was the first antimonial
used for this purpose in cases of human leishmaniosis. It was also used in
the treatment of Trypanosoma congolense congolense and T. v. vivax
infections in cattle and T. b. evansi infections in camels. Extravascular
injection causes severe necrosis and the compound has a narrow
chemotherapeutic index resulting in about 6% mortality during routine
treatment.
Pentavalent antimony compounds meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime
or N-methylglucamine antimoniate), sodium antimony gluconate and
sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) have been the first-line drugs for the
treatment of leishmaniosis in humans and are the principal antimonials
used for the treatment of canine leishmaniosis. The precise chemical
structure of these drugs is difficult to identify. Drug tolerance  to
antimonials in human and canine leishmaniosis is known and there may be
considerable rates of treatment failure and relapses. These drugs may
show marked toxic effects such as arthralgia, nephrotoxicity and
cardiotoxicity, leading rarely to sudden death. Antimonials are
administered either by intralesional infiltration in simple single cutaneous
lesions or by intramuscular injection in all cases with systemic
involvement. Antimony is excreted quickly from the body so that daily

Arsenicals are substituted benzene arsonic acid salts or esters and have

Roxarsone was used primarily as a growth promoter but had some
activity against Eimeria tenella and E. brunetti in chickens when used
alone or in combination with nitromide or dinitolmide. Arsenicals have a
low safety index and have been superseded by comparatively less toxic
compounds.

SUBSTITUTEDAROMATICS
Amidinesanddiamidines
Pentamidine has the widest spectrum within the group with activity
against Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Babesia and Pneumocystis, and is used
of leishmaniosis. Amicarbilide is active against Babesia and diminazene

Diminazene is highly active against babesiosis in cattle, sheep, pigs,
horses and dogs although the small Babesia spp are generally more
of individual animal tolerance to the drug; it is well tolerated in horses at
the recommended dose, although higher doses may cause severe side
effects. Various treatment regimens are used for eliminating babesiosis in
cattle, horses and dogs. [n most cases the recommended dose is given in
divided doses, e.g. 5 mg/kg, twice at 24-hour intervals, to eradicate
Babesia spp infections in horses, or 1.75 mg/kg twice at 24-hour intervals
to reduce or avoid neurotoxic side effects in horses (lethargy,
incoordination and seizures) and dogs (ataxia, opisthotonus, nystagmus,

doserate.
Diminazine is also effective against Trypanosoma congolense congolense
and T. v. vivax, but less active against T. b. brucei and T. b. evansi
infections and shows no activity against T. c. simiae. Widespread use may
lead to development of diminazene-resistant T. v. vivax and T. c.

is uncertain but may be similar to that of pentamidine and diminazene.
Arylamides and urea derivatives
Nitolmide and dinitolmide are arylamides (nitrobenzamides) used as
coccidiostats in poultry appearing to affect first-generation meronts; they
are active against Eimeria tenella and E. necatrix infections but have
        
combination with roxarsone as in-feed coccidiostats for use in chickens
Nicarbazin (phenyl urea) is also used as a coccidiostat in the control of
coccidiosis in chickens and turkeys in shuttle programmes (starter feed
only) usually in the winter and for that reason resistance of coccidia to
nicarbazine is not yet widespread. It is also used in combination with
narasin as it shows synergistic effect with the ionophores. It affects
second-generation meronts, impairing oocyst formation and allowing
      do o s 
problems with side effects, as it can cause increased sensitivity to heat
stress during summer, which results in growth depression and mortality in
broilers. The drug should not be fed to laying hens because of toxic side
effects (reduced hatchability, interruption of egg laying)
Imidocarb diproprionate is a phenyl urea and is the drug of choice for
the treatment of babesiosis in cattle, horses and dogs. It appears to act
directly on the parasite leading to an alteration in morphology, and is

against large Babesia spp of pigs, horses and dogs. The drug has a low

therapeutic index and may stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system
by anticholinesterase activity. The mode of action is unknown.
These compounds have similar modes of action and act by uncoupling
oxidase and glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, which prevents
re-oxidation of NADH and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
synthesis.
Sulphonic acids
Suramin and trypan blue were amongst the first antiprotozoals. Suramin
was one of the first antitrypanosomal drugs developed and shows high
efficacy against trypanosomes of subgenus Trypanozoon (7. b. brucei, T.
b. evansi, T. equiperdum) and is the drug of choice for T. b. evansi
infections (surra) in camels and horses. The drug inhibits enzymes in the
glucose metabolism pathway preventing re-oxidation of NADH and
decreased ATP synthesis. [t may be toxic in horses, causing oedema of
sexual organs, lips and eyelids or painful hoofs. Intramuscular
administration can cause severe necrosis at the injection site and
sub-optimal dosing (less than 1 g/l00 kg body weight) may lead to
suramin-resistant strains.
Trypan blue is an azo-napthalene dye used for the treatment of babesiosis
and was the first specific drug with activity against B. bigemina in cattle.

and second-stage meronts of Eimeria. It is both coccidiostatic and
coccidiocidal and is used for the treatment of coccidiosis in chickens,
turkeys and rabbits. It has a broad spectrum of activity but in rabbits it is
active against intestinal Eimeria spp only. It is thought to interfere with
ATPase activity.
Dapsone and acedapsone are sulphones active against Plasmodium and
malaria. Their mode of action is similar to the sulphonamides, acting as
antifolate drugs, blocking the incorporation of PABA to form dihydrofolic

Methylbenzoquate is usually administered in combination with clopidol
or meticlorpindol, mainly in shuttle or rotation programmes to achieve a

coccidiosis in chickens and turkeys.
Iodoquinol is a 4-hydroxyquinolone that is active against Entamoeba.
Quinine, chloroquine, droxycholoquine, primaquine and mefloquine
are quinolines used  primarily as antimalarial  treatments in human
medicine, inhibiting electron transport processes by inhibiting pyrimidine
synthesis.
Primaquine diphosphate is active against tissue stages of Plasmodium,
but is much less active against erythrocytic stages. It has been shown to be
active against Babesia felis in cats at 0.5 mg/kg by intramuscular
injection, although doses above l mg/kg caused mortality. It has also been
used in the treatment or prevention of avian malaria (1o0 mg/kg per os).
Clopidol and meticlorpindol are pyridinols and are active against
first-generation  meronts,  arresting  sporozoite  and  trophozoite
development; they are effective against all Eimeria spp in chickens,
although resistance problems limit their use to shuttle programmes. Both
compounds need to be given before or shortly after exposure and are used
as a coccidiostats. Clopidol is used in the prevention of coccidiosis in
chickens, partridge, guinea fowl, pheasants and rabbits with a high safety
index.
Emetine and dehydroemetine are isoquinolines with activity against
Entamoeba. The acridine derivative, quinacrine, is active against
Plasmodium and Giardia. Acriflavine hydrochloride is active against
Babesia bigemina and other large Babesia spp.
PYRIMIDINEDERIVATIVES
Amprolium is structurally similar to thiamine (vitamin Bl) and is a
competitive thiamine antagonist. Because of the relatively high thiamine
requirement of rapidly dividing coccidian cells compared with most host
cells, the drug has a high safety margin. Amprolium acts on
first-generation meronts, thereby preventing differentiation of merozoites,

Amprolium + ethopabate have been combined with sulphaquinoxaline and

against all Eimeria spp); lambs and calves; sows to control disease in
suckling pigs pre- and post-farrowing; and rabbits to control intestinal
Eimeria spp, but they are ineffective against hepatic coccidiosis in rabbits.
Pyrimethamine and trimethoprim  are both folate antagonists with
activity against Pneumocystis and are useful for treating various types of
coccidiosis (eimeriosis, toxoplasmosis, sarcocystosis, neosporosis),
malaria and bacterial infections. These compounds target the enzyme
dihydrofolate reductase, inhibit pyrimidine biosynthesis and DNA
metabolism and are usually used in combination with long-acting
sulphonamides. As antifolates they synergise the anticoccidial action of
sulphonamides by blocking the same biosynthetic pathway.
Halofuginone is a quinazoline affecting first- and second-generation
meronts of Eimeria and is used in the control of coccidiosis in chickens
and turkeys. The drug has also been shown to possess marked
antitheilerial activity in cattle, and is available in some countries for the
prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in calves. It has also been
shown to be effective against acute sarcosporidiosis in goats and sheep
(Sarcocystis capracanis and S. ovicanis, respectively at 0.67 mg/kg on
two successive days). The therapeutic index of halofuginone is low and
overdose may produce severe diarrhoea and cachexia.

coccidiostatic after a short medication period or coccidiocidal after long
periods of medication. Arprinocid acts against coccidia by inhibiting
hypoxanthine transport.
PHENATHRIDIUMS
This group of compounds, which includes isometamidium, homidium
and quinapyrimine, has been used exclusively in the treatment of
trypanosomiosis. The mode of action appears to be interference with
nucleic acid synthesis by intercalative DNA binding. Other drugs of this
series, pyrithridium, phenidium chloride and dimidium bromide, were
replaced because of a high incidence of delayed toxicity, including
Isometamidium isasynthetic hybridof   the diazotised
p-aminobenzamidine moiety of diminazene molecule linked with
homidium chloride. The drug is highly active against Trypanosoma vivax
vivax infections in ruminants and horses as well as against T. c.
congolense infections in ruminants, horses and dogs. It is less active
against T. b. brucei and T. b. evansi infections in horses, ruminants,
camels and dogs. The recommended dose is usually well tolerated by
cattle. However, intramuscular injection can cause severe local reactions
at the injection site. Intravenous injection in horses and camels may avoid
local reaction but may cause systemic toxicity (salivation, tachycardia,
profuse diarrhoea, hindleg weakness and collapse due to histamine
release).
Homidium salts (bromide or chloride) are effective against T. v. vivax
        o s i  e 
Their limited protective activity in cattle depends on severity of challenge
and may last 3-5 weeks. Homidium can also be used for treating T. v.
vivax and T. c. congofense infections in horses and dogs. Widespread use
in cattle resulted in appearance of resistant T. c. congolense strains in east
and west Africa. Homidium-resistant trypanosomes can be controlled by
diminazene or isometamidium at increased dose rates. The drug is
generally well tolerated at the recommended dose and also at higher dose
levels, but may be irritant at sites of injection. Deep intramuscular
injection effectively reduces local irritations. Severe reactions may occur
1810
in horses after intramuscular injection, whereas intravenous injection
seems to be well tolerated.
Quinapyrimine is highly active against T. c. congolense, T. v. vivax, T. b.
brucei and T. b. evansi and reaches therapeutic levels quickly. The target
 of action of quinapyramine is protein synthesis, displacing magnesium
(Mg ) ions and polyamines from cytoplasmic ribosomes, leading to an
extensive loss of ribosomes and condensation of kinetoplast DNA. The
drug can cause local and systemic reactions (salivation, shaking.
trembling, diarrhoea, collapse) in cattle, horse, dogs and pigs within
development of drug-resistant strains of T. c. congolense have limited its
usefulness in treating trypanosomiosis in cattle. However, the drug seems
to be safe and efficient for treating surra (7. b. evansi) in camels and
horses as well as T. b. evansi infections in pigs. Quinapyramine-resistant
strains are usually controlled by isometamidium. Quinapyramine is active
against suramin-resistant strains of T. b. evansi and T. b. brucei.
TRIAZONES
Toltrazuril is a symmetrical triazone compound and is active against all
intracellular stages of coccidia found in chicken, geese, ducks and cattle,
sheep, goats and pigs. Toltrazuril is used therapeutically for the treatment
of outbreaks of coccidiosis. It can be administered via drinking water and,
because of its long residual activity, it can be used intermittently, allowing
development of protective immunity.
Diclazuril and clazuril are asymmetrical triazones with a broad spectrum
of  activities against  various coccidia in  birds and animals at low
concentrations (0.5-2 ppm in  feed). Diclazuril has a strong
anticoccidiocidal activity and has been developed as a feed additive for
the prevention of coccidiosis in chickens and turkeys. It is active against
developing first- and second-generation meronts and gamonts of Eimeria
stages most affected by diclazuril varies with the Eimeria species. It is
highly effective against all stages of E. tenella but only against gamont
stages of E. maxima. Due to the development of resistance, it is used
frequently in shuttle programmes. Diclazuril is also used for the treatment
of rabbit coccidiosis, showing high activity against hepatic and intestinal
coccidiosis, and in the treatment and prevention of coccidiosis in sheep.
1811
Clazuril has only limited action against some chicken coccidia, but is
highly active against coccidiosis in pigeons.

ANTIBACTERIALS
Sulphonamides
Sulphonamides, such as sulphadimidine, sulphamethoxypyrizidine,
sulphaguanidine, sulphaquinoxaline and sulphachloropyrazine, are
structural antagonists of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which is
incorporated into folic acid. They inhibit the conversion of dihydrofolic
acid to tetrahydrofolic acid at the dihydropteroate synthase step.
Tetrahydrofolate is an important cofactor in many active single carbon
transfer reactions, required for the synthesis of certain amino acids,
purines and especially the synthesis of de-oxythymidylate,required for
DNA synthesis. Large doses used for therapeutic applications often cause
toxicity (haemorrhagic syndrome, kidney damage and growth depression).
Sulphonamides were among the first anticoccidials and are active against
first- and second-stage meronts, being coccidiostatic at low doses and
coccidiocidal at higher doses. Many of the compounds used in chickens

coccidiosis in cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats and rabbits. When given in
combination   with  pyrimethamine   and   other  diaminopyrimidines,
long-acting sulphonamides (e.g. sulphadoxine or sulphamethoxine) are
highly active antibacterials, antimalarials and anticoccidials.
1812
Nitroimidazoles
The nitroimidazoles include dimetridazole, ornidazole, ronidazole,
tinadazole, carnidazole and metronidazole, which appear to interfere
with RNA synthesis, and nifursol, which acts by causing damage to lipids
and DNA within the cells.
These compounds exhibit potent activity against trichomonads,
Histomonas, Spironucieus and Giardia, and were the drugs of choice for
these infections in turkeys and gamebirds. Ronidazole, dimetridazole and
nifursol were used in the treatment of Histomonas infections in turkeys
and gamebirds (pheasants, partridge); however, because of concerns over
mutagenicity their use has been suspended in many countries. Carnidazole
is used for the treatment of trichomoniosis in pigeons. Metronidazole,
ornidazole and tinazole are used in humans for the treatment of giardiosis
and amoebiosis.
Nitrofurans
The nitrofurans, which include furazolidone, nitrofurazone and
coccidiostatic activity; concerns over toxicity and carcinogenicity have
countries. Furazolidone has been used for the prevention and treatment of
coccidiosis in chickens, turkeys and pigs and for the treatment of bacterial
digestive tract infections and giardiosis. Nitrofurazone is active against
second-generation meronts of Eimeria tenella and E. necatrix infections in
poultry, and has been used for control of coccidiosis in lambs and goat
kids.
Ionophores
The polyether ionophores are fermentation products of Streptomyces or
Actinomadura. These are currently the most widely used anticoccidial
compounds used mainly for the control of poultry coccidosis. Monensin,
narasin,
salinomycin,
maduramicin
and semduramicin
are
'monovalent' ionophores preferentially binding to monovalent ions,

and is termed a ‘divalent’ ionophore. The effect is to destroy

These compounds are extremely toxic to horses. lonophores such as

when administered with tiamulin, and most of the ionophores may interact
with sulphonamides, chloramphenicol and erythromycin.

used for the treatment of Toxoplasma infections. Clindamycin is a
lincosamide with a similar mode of action, and has been used to treat
Plasmodium, Babesia and Toxoplasma infections.
Amphotericin B is a polyene macrolide antibiotic used mainly as an
antifungal agent but is also used as a second-line drug for the treatment of
Leishmania. The drug is extremely nephrotoxic but lipid and unilamellar
liposome formulations of amphotericin B have been developed with lower
toxicity.
Aminoglycoside antibiotics
Aminogycoside antibiotics are bactericidal agents and are widely applied
for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Aminoglycosides
is reserved for the treatment of gastrointestinal infections. Parmomycin
has activity against Entamoeba,Giardia,Balantidium and Leishmania.
Tetracycline antibiotics
The tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibacterials active against a range
of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but also against the
Rickettsiales (Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma),and Mycopiasma and
Chlamydia. The mode of action is thought to be through inhibition of
protein synthesis.
Oxytetracycline, tetracycline and chlortetracycline have similar
properties and may be given orally or by intramuscular injection.
Doxycycline is more lipophilic than the other tetracyclines and is better
absorbed orally and penetrates better into the lung and cerebrospinal fluid.
Members of this group exhibit the broadest antiprotozoal activity and have
been used for the treatment of Plasmodium, Balantidium, Theileria and
Entamoeba. Oxytetracycline has been shown to control active Babesia
every 4 days.
1815
USE OF ANTIPROTOZOALS
The use of antiprotozoals as therapeutic or prophylactic agents is similar
to thatdescribedfor anthelmintics.
METHODSOFADMINISTRATION
Anticoccidials used for controlling enteric coccidia principally belonging
to the genus, Eimeria, are administered in feed. In the poultry industry, it
is usual to employ anticoccidials in broiler birds continuously in feed until
just before slaughter. In layer replacement stock, pullets are medicated
continuously until commencement of egg-laying. Continuous use of
anticoccidials may lead to ineffective treatment due to drug resistance; as
a consequence, various rotational programmes have been developed by the
poultry industry to reduce or avoid this problem.
Antiprotozoals are generally used in two ways: therapeutically, to treat
existing infections or clinical outbreaks, or prophylactically, in which the
timing of treatment is based on knowledge of the epidemiology. Clearly
prophylactic use is preferable where administration of a drug at selected

RESISTANCE
ANTHELMINTICRESISTANCE
Drug resistance is heritable and repeated dosing will therefore select for
an increasing proportion of resistant individuals. The mechanisms involve
either differences in drug metabolism within the parasite and/or mutations
at the binding site of the drug. The prevalence and severity of anthelmintic
resistance is increasing and leading to uncontrolled loss of production.
Helminth resistance to anthelmintics has been most frequently recorded in
sheep and goats (mainly Haemonchus spp and Trichostrongylus spp in
tropical and subtropical regions and Teladorsagia in temperate areas) and
        
benzimidazole group of compounds. Over the last decade resistance to all
three chemical classes of broad-spectrum  anthelmintics,  1-BZ
(benzimidazoles and probenzimidazoles), 2-LM (levamisole/morantel)
and 3-AV (avermectins/milbemycins), and in some cases to the
narrow-spectrum anthelmintics, such as closantel, has become more
widespread in nematode  parasites  of  smallruminants. These
multi-resistant isolates are particularly prevalent in countries in the
southern hemisphere, such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and
South American countries. The differences in the rate of emergence of
anthelmintic resistance between these agroclimatic zones are considered to
be due to the number of parasite generations and biotic potential of the
 parasite species involved and also to the proportion of the total population
which is not exposed to the drug (i.e. left in refugia). Frequency of
treatment and underdosing are considered to be the main cause of
benzimidazole andlevamisole resistance inHaemonchusand
Teladorsagia. The timing of treatments and the presence of larvae in
refugia may be particularly important in the development of macrocyclic
1817
lactone resistance. Trematode resistance to flukicides is currently at a
considerably lower level.
Studies have shown minimal reversion to susceptibility in highly selected
homozygous isolates following withdrawal of the selecting drug and, as a
consequence, once resistant worms are present on a livestock enterprise
they can be considered as permanent. Therefore, it is important to be able
to detect the presence of emerging resistant isolates at an early stage.
Unfortunately, the in vivo faecal egg count reduction test and the in vitro
egg hatch assay, larval development assay and larval migration inhibition
assay, used to detect the presence of resistant isolates, are insensitive and
will only detect resistant parasites when resistant parasites comprise
around 25% of the total population. The use of a discriminating dose of
anthelmintic may increase the sensitivity. New molecular-based probes
are more sensitive but to date are only available for the benzimidazoles
Strategies  todelay  the development/transmission of  anthelmintic
resistance are discussed under Treatment, prevention and control of
parasitic gastroenteritis in sheep (Chapter 3). No new anthelmintic
families are expected to be licensed in the near future, partly due to cost,
and partly as the sheep sector is a small global market. It is therefore
reliance on anthelmintics. Non-chemical approaches include:
1. The breeding of sheep that are able to resist or tolerate worm
infections.
 2. Feeding of nematophagous fungi which are able to trap larvae in
the faeces and thus reduce pasture contamination.
3. Dietary supplementation with rumen bypass protein or forages
rich in condensed tannins to increase the supply of protein to the
small intestine and thus enhance the rate of acquisition of immunity.
4. Periodic grazing of pastures that contain forage species with
anthelminticproperties.
5. The application of new molecular vaccines. These new

1818
PESTICIDERESISTANCE
At the recommended doses modern insecticides are highly effective at
removing susceptible individuals, but they can impose strong selection
pressure for the development of resistance. The development of resistance
may reduce the effectiveness of the treatment applied and thereby increase
the frequency of application and the dose required, in turn increasing the
costs and adding to the environmental impact.
There are two major variables that determine the rate at which resistance
is likely to spread throughout the population: its mechanism of inheritance
and the severity of selective pressure (what percentage of susceptible
individuals survive each generation). In general, resistance will spread
through a population most rapidly when it is inherited as a single,
dominant allele and selective pressure is high (meaning very few
susceptible individuals escape and reproduce).
When an insect population develops resistance to one pesticide, it may
also prove to be resistant to similar compounds that have the same mode
of action. This phenomenon, known as class resistance, occurs frequently
or pyrethroid insecticides. In some cases, a population may develop a
form of resistance that protects it from compounds in more than one
chemical class. This is known as cross-resistance, and may result in an
insecticides.
Overall, resistance in the majority of ectoparasite species is not as severe
or widespread a problem as that seen in endoparasites.

attack are recommended. In addition, however, it is essential to ensure that
manufacturer's recommendations are scrupulously followed and that all
apparatus is calibrated correctly and working effectively.
For farmers wanting to reduce reliance on synthetic insecticides, a range
of management practices and nonchemical methods may be utilised in an
integrated manner to reduce ectoparasite prevalence. One or several
techniques may be used, but importantly these should be integrated with
each other to form components of a general livestock ectoparasite
control technologies which modify some aspect of the parasite's
environment, on or off the host, either to increase pest mortality, to reduce
fecundity or to reduce contact between the pest and host.
There can be little doubt that resistance to existing chemicals is unlikely to
be reversed and indeed will become more widespread, and that new
compounds developed in the future will also select for resistance.
Probably the most optimistic prognosis is that appropriate management
will allow the rate of development of resistance to be reduced.
1820
ANTIPROTOZOALRESISTANCE
Continuous use of antiprotozoals has also led to ineffective treatment due
to drug resistance in the target parasite populations. This is perhaps best

crucial in the successful control of coccidiosis in the rapidly expanding
poultry industries throughout the world. However the emergence of
resistance has been rapid and has limited the useful life of many chemical
anticoccidials, although the speed at which resistance develops varies
greatly between compounds. With the ionophorus antibiotics, which have
dominated the scene for the last two decades, resistance has been
considerably slower to develop. Nevertheless, resistance to this group has
been reported in both Europe and the USA, with crossresistance occurring
notably among the monovalent cation group. Although ionophore-resistant
strains may be present, it is possible that the numbers of oocysts are
insufficient to cause clinical coccidiosis. Selection pressure is therefore
probably lower than with many of the chemical anticoccidials. It has been
suggested that this incomplete control of parasite development stimulates
production of immunity in the host and this may be a major factor in the
effectiveness of ionophores in the field.
Knowledge of the mode of action of anticoccidial compounds is necessary
to understand the mechanisms of resistance. Although some information is
       
drugs, explanations for their selectivity are either circumstantial or
unknown. As in other parasites, the most likely mechanism of resistance
involves modification of the target receptor so that its sensitivity to
1821
inhibition is decreased. Compounds that share a similar mode of action
may also share resistance (cross-resistance). This should be distinguished
  s  q  is  i is  
differing modes of action.
It has been shown that parasites resistant to the recommended levels of
certain anticoccidial drugs may be suppressed if the concentration of drug
is increased. Resistance to these higher concentrations, however, is likely
to develop rapidly after further selection. Increasing the concentration of a
drug may, therefore, only be of use in the short term and, in any case,
would not be practical because most anticoccidial drugs are used at levels
close to those that are toxic to the chicken.
Resistant strains may emerge if anticoccidial drugs have been employed at
concentrations lower than those normally recommended for control.[t
would therefore appear to be important to maintain adequate drug levels in
the field in order to reduce the possibility of selecting resistant strains. A
reduction in the use of drugs is desirable since it is generally accepted that
the selection of genes for resistance will occur more rapidly as the
frequency of treatment is increased. Control of coccidiosis may be
build-up of infection in a poultry house. Such a policy would, however, be
conversion etc. that would probably result.
The genetics of anticoccidial resistance in Eimeria are poorly understood.
Most drugs inhibit the asexual stages of the life cycle. Many of the
complexities involved in the selection of resistance in diploid organisms.
such as the degree of dominance of resistance genes, are absent because
these stages are haploid. Any resistant mutants will, therefore, be

Alternation of drugs (rotation) with different modes of action has been
widely advocated in the poultry industry, but this has been based upon an
empirical, rather than scientific, basis. It is not known for what duration
(number of crops) a particular drug should be used before changing to
another anticoccidial agent. Alternation of drugs within a single crop
1823
(shuttle programmes) has also been widely practised. It has been claimed
that this may slow the development of resistance but no evidence to
support this contention has been provided. The period of medication for
the drugs in a shuttle may be too short to eliminate any resistant forms
Resistant parasites may survive in the litter for the life of the crop and the
subsequent use of the same drugs would result in further selection
pressure for resistance. A likely result of short periods of alternation
between drugs is the development of strains resistant to several drugs
(multiple resistance).Vaccines based upon live,attenuated parasites are a
possible alternative to medication for the control of coccidiosis.
Alternating cycles of planned immunisation and chemotherapy might

interval, however, before a population recovers susceptibility to a drug is
likely to be considerably longer than the time taken to acquire resistance.
It is also probable that resistance will re-emerge more rapidly if older
compounds are reintroduced. Various combinations of drugs have been
employed to extend the spectrum of activity against different species of
Eimeria rather than prevent the development of resistance (e.g. amprolium
and ethopabate). Mixtures have also been used to reduce the risk of
toxicity since, in some cases, adequate activity can be obtained with lower
doses than if the drugs are used alone (e.g. naracin and nicarbazin). Even
where these combination drug mixtures have been used, resistance has
developed.
Another area in which resistance has become a problem is in the control of
trypanosomiosis. Drug resistance was first noted in trypanosomes to the
arsenicals and aromatic compounds. For example, diminazene-resistance
in Trypanosoma vivax vivax and T. c. congolense strains is now
widespread. As a rule, diminazene-resistant strains are susceptible to
isometamidium. Widespread use of homidium and quinapyridine in cattle
resulted in the appearance of resistant T. c. congoiense strains in east and
west Africa. Homidium-resistant trypanosomes can be controlled by
diminazene    or    isometamidium   at 
increased   dose   rates.
Quinapyramine-resistant strains are usually controlled by isometamidium.
Quinapyramine is also active against suramin-resistant strains of T. b.

required for some of the concentration methods of examination.

preparation is then examined microscopically. It is possible to detect most
eggs or larvae by this method, but due to the small amount of faeces used
it may only detect relatively heavy infections.
FLOTATIONMETHODS
The basis of any flotation method is that when worm eggs are suspended
in a liquid with a specific gravity higher than that of the eggs, the latter
will float up to the surface. Nematode and cestode eggs float in a liquid
with a specific gravity of between 1.10 and 1.20; trematode eggs, which
are much heavier, require a specific gravity of 1.30-1.35.
The flotation solutions used for nematode and cestode ova are mainly
based on sodium chloride or sometimes magnesium sulphate. A saturated
solution of these is prepared and stored for a few days and the specific
density 1.2 is preferred. For trematode eggs, saturated solutions of zinc
chloride or zinc sulphate are widely used. Some laboratories use the more
expensive and toxic potassium mercury iodine solution.
1826
Whatever solutions are employed the specific gravity should be checked
made rapidly, otherwise distortion may take place.
Directflotation
A small amount of fresh faeces, say 2.0 g, is added to 10 ml of the
flotation solution and, following thorough mixing, the suspension is
poured into a test tube and more flotation solution added to fill the tube to
the top. A coverslip is then placed on top of the surface of the liquid and
the tube and coverslip are left standing for 10-15 minutes. The coverslip
is then removed vertically and placed on a slide and examined under the
flotation solution may be accelerated by centrifugation.
McMaster method
This quantitative technique is used where it is desirable to count the
number of eggs or larvae per gram of faeces. The method is as follows:
1. Weigh 3.0 g of faeces or, if faeces are diarrhoeic, 3 teaspoonfuls
2. Break up thoroughly in 42 ml of water in a plastic container. This
can be done using a homogeniser if available or in a stoppered
bottle containing glass beads.
3. Pour through a fine mesh sieve (aperture 205 μm, or 100 to 1
inch).
4. Collect filtrate, agitate and fill a 15 ml test tube.
5. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes.
6. Pour off supernatant, agitate sediment and fill tube to previous
level with flotation solution.
7. Invert tube six times and remove fluid with pipette to fill both
chambers of McMaster slide (Fig. 15.l). Leave no fluid in the
pipette or else pipette rapidly, since the eggs will rise quickly in the
flotation fluid.
8. Examine one chamber and multiply number of eggs or larvae
to arrive at the number of eggs per gram of faeces (epg):
If 3 g of faeces are dissolved in 42 ml
1827
Total volume is
45 ml
Therefore 1 g
15 ml
The volume under etched area is 0.1S ml
Therefore, the number of eggs is multiplied by 10o. If two chambers are
examined, multiply by 50.
An abbreviated version of this technique is to homogenise the 3 g of
the McMaster slide. Although a faster process, the slide contents are more
difficult to ‘read' because of their dark colour.
It is impossible to calculate from the epg the actual worm population of
the host, since many factors influence egg production of worms and the
number of eggs also varies with the species. Nevertheless, egg counts in
excess of 1o00 are generally considered indicative of heavy infections and
those over 500 of moderate infection. However, a low epg is not
necessarily indicative of very low infections, since patency may just be
newly established; alternatively, the epg may be affected by developing
immunity. The eggs of some species, such as certain ascarids,
Strongyloides, Oxyuris, Trichuris and Capillaria, can be easily recognised
morphologically. However, with the exception of Nematodirus spp, the

While this technique will detect the eggs and larvae of most nematodes,
cestodes and coccidia, it will not demonstrate trematode eggs, which have
a higher specific density. For these, a flotation fluid of higher specific
gravity such as a saturated solution of zinc sulphate has to be used or a
sedimentation method employed as described below
SEDIMENTATIONMETHODS
For trematode eggs:
1. Homogenise 3 g of faeces with water and pass the suspension
through a coarse mesh sieve (250 μm). Thoroughly wash the
material that is retained on this screen, using a fine water jet and
discard the debris.
             
minutes, remove the supernatant, and transfer the remainder
(approximately 12-15 ml) to a flat-bottomed tube.
3. After sedimentation for a further 2 minutes the supernatant is
again drawn off, a few drops of 5% methylene blue added and the
sediment screened using a low power stereomicroscope. Any
trematode eggs are readily visible against the pale blue background
For lungworm larvae, the Baerman apparatus may be used. This consists
of a glass funnel held in a retort stand. A rubber tube, attached to the
bottom of the funnel, is constricted by a clip. A sieve (aperture 250 μm) is
placed in the wide neck of the funnel, which has been partially filled with
water, and a double layer of gauze is placed on top of the sieve. Faeces are

which is then inverted and placed on the sieve. The apparatus is left
overnight at room temperature during which the larvae migrate out of the
faeces and through the sieve to sediment in the neck of the funnel. The
clip on the rubber is then removed and the water in the neck of the funnel
A simple adaptation of the above method is to suspend the faeces enclosed

CULTUREANDIDENTIFICATION
OFLARVAE
Two techniques are widely used for the culture of infective larvae from
nematode eggs.
In the first, faeces are placed in a jar with a lid and stored in the dark at a
temperature of 21-24°C. The lid should be lined with moist filter paper
and should not be tightly attached. After 7 days’ incubation, the jar is
filled with water and allowed to stand for 2-3 hours. The larvae will
migrate into the water and the latter is poured into a cylinder for
sedimentation. The larval suspension can be cleaned and concentrated by
using the Baermann apparatus as described above and then killed by
adding a few drops of Lugol's iodine and examined microscopically.
An alternative method is to spread faeces on the middle third of filter
paper placed in a moistened petri dish. After storage at 21-24°C for 7-10
days, the dish is flooded with water and the larvae harvested as before.
The identification of infective larvae is a specialist technique and requires
some experience. A key to the identification of infective larvae is provided
in Table 15.4 and Figure 15.12.
RECOVERYOFALIMENTARY
NEMATODES
Details are given below of a technique for the collection, counting and
identification of the alimentary nematodes of ruminants. The procedure is
similar for other host species, information on identification being available
in the text.
1. As soon as possible after removing the alimentary tract from the
body cavity, the abomasal/duodenal junction should be ligatured to
prevent transfer of parasites from one site to the other.
2. Separate the abomasum, small intestine and large intestine.
3. Open the abomasum along the side of the greater curvature, wash
         
volume up to 24 litres.
1830
4. After thorough mixing transfer duplicate 200 ml samples to
suitably labelled containers and preserve in 1o% formalin.
5. Scrape off the abomasal mucosa and digest in a pepsin/HCl
mixture at 42°C for 6 hours; 200 g of mucosa will require 1 litre of
mixture. Make digest up to a volume of 2 or 4 litres with cold water
and again take duplicate 200 ml samples. Alternatively, the
Williams technique may be used. In this, the washed abomasum is
placed, mucosal surface down, in a bucket containing several litres
of normal saline and maintained at 40°C for 4 hours. Subsequently,
the abomasum is gently rubbed in a second bucket of warm saline.

scored with lines to facilitate counting; add 2-3 ml sodium
thiosulphate solution to decolourise debris. If necessary, worms
may be preserved in an aqueous solution of 10% formalin or 70%
alcohol. To clear large worms for microscopic examination,
immerse in lactophenol for a suitable period prior to examination.
3. Examine for the presence of parasites using a stereoscopic
microscope (x12 objective) and identify and count parasites as
male, female and larval stages.

IDENTIFICATIONOFNEMATODE
EGGS
The presence of nematode eggs in faeces is a useful aid to diagnosis of
worm infections as they can be identified and counted in faecal samples
(Figs 15.2-15.10). Strongyle eggs are approximately 60-80 μm long, 0val,
of Trichuris, Nematodirus spp and Strongyloides can be identified and
may be counted and reported separately.
THIRD-STAGE LARVAL
IDENTIFICATION
by worms of one particular genus or not, particularly on farms where
Haemonchus occurs. If so, larval culture and differentiation can be
performed, usually using the faeces from the FEC. This technique takes a
1835
further 10-14 days, so results are not available for some time after the
FEC is known.

Larval differentiation (Table 15.4,Figs 15.11
1and 15.12) requires the
hatching of the eggs in the sample, culture in sterile faeces or peat, and the
subsequent identification of the larvae. Usually, 50 or 100 larvae are
counted, and the percentage of each genus reported. It should be noted that
eggs of each genus do not always hatch at the same rate because of
differences in temperature requirements for the different genera. Larval
culture results should therefore be used as a general indication of the
worm genera present, rather than a precise determination of the proportion
of the FEC contributed by each genus.

TECHNIQUE
A small drop of suspension of larvae is placed on a microscope and a drop
of Gram's iodine added and a coverslip placed over the drops. The iodine
kills the larvae and allows for easier identification of the salient features

lungs and transferred to glass beakers containing saline. The worms are
best counted immediately, failing which they should be left overnight at
4°C which will reduce clumping. Additional worms may be recovered if
the opened lungs are soaked in warm saline overnight.
Another method is Inderbitzen's modification of the perfusion technique,
described by Wolff et af. (1969), in which the lungs are perfused, is as
follows. The pericardial sac is incised and reflected to expose the
pulmonary artery in which a 2 cm incision is made. Rubber tubing is
introduced into the artery and fixed in situ by double ligatures. The
remaining large blood vessels are tied off and water from a mains supply
bronchiolar walls, flushes out the bronchial lumina, and is expelled from
the trachea. The fluid is collected and its contents concentrated by passing
through a fine sieve (aperture 38 μm). As before, this is best examined
immediately for the presence of adult worms and larvae.
The smaller genera of lungworms of small ruminants are difficult to
recover and enumerate, although the Inderbitzen technique may be of
value.

RECOVERYOFTREMATODEAND
CESTODE PARASITES
For both Fasciola and Dicrocoelium the livers are removed and cut into
slices approximately l cm thick. On squeezing the liver slices, any flukes
seen grossly are removed and formalised and the slices immersed in warm
water overnight. The gallbladder should also be opened and washed, and
any flukes removed.
After soaking, the liver slices are again squeezed, rinsed in clean water
and discarded. Both washings are passed through a fine sieve (aperture
1845
1 00 μm) and the material retained and formalised. [n the case of intestinal
paramphistomes, the first 4 m of duodenum should be tied off, opened,
washed and examined for adherent trematodes.
Counts are carried out microscopically, entire flukes plus the numbers of
heads and tails being recorded. The highest number of either of the latter
is added to the number of entire flukes to give the total count.
Cestodes are usually readily visible in the intestine or liver, but whenever
possible these should be removed intact so that, if necessary, the head and
the mature and gravid segments are all available  for specialist
examination. In the case of Echinococcus in canids, however, the worms
should be undertaken.
OTHERAIDS TODIAGNOSIS
There are two other techniques which are useful aids in the diagnosis of
trichostrongyle infections in ruminants. The first is the plasma pepsinogen
test and the second the estimation of infective larvae on herbage. Both of
these techniques should be undertaken in a specialist parasitology
laboratory, but a short account is given here of the material required for
these tests, the basis of the techniques and how the results may be
interpreted.
THEPLASMAPEPSINOGENTEST
The estimation of circulating pepsinogen is of value in the diagnosis of
abomasal damage, and is especially elevated in cases of ostertagiosis.
Elevations also occur with other gastric parasites such as Trichostrongylus
axei, Haemonchus contortus and, in the pig, Hyostrongylus rubidus.
The principle of the test, which is best carried out by a diagnostic
laboratory, is that the sample of serum or plasma is acidified to pH 2.0,
thus activating the inactive zymogen, pepsinogen, to the active proteolytic
enzyme pepsin. This activated pepsin is then allowed to react with a
protein substrate (usually bovine serum albumin) and the enzyme
concentration calculated in international units (μmol tyrosine released per
100 ml serum per minute). The tyrosine liberated from the protein
1846
substrate by the pepsin is estimated by the blue colour, which is formed
when phenolic compounds react with Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent. The
minimum requirement for the test, as carried out in most laboratories, is
1.5 ml serum or plasma. The anticoagulant used for plasma samples is
either EDTA or heparin.
In parasitic gastritis of ruminants due to Ostertagia spp and T. axei the
levels of plasma pepsinogen become elevated. In parasite-free animals the
level is less than 1.o iu of tyrosine; in moderately infected animals, it is
between 1.0 and 2.0 and in heavily infected animals it usually exceeds 3.0,
reaching as high as 1o.0 or more on occasion. Interpretation is simple in
animals during their first 18 months, but thereafter becomes difficult as
the level may become elevated when older and immune animals are under
challenge. In such cases the absence of the classical clinical signs of
diarrhoea and weight loss indicates that there are few adult parasites
present.
PASTURE LARVAL COUNTS
For this technique, samples of grass are plucked from the pasture and
placed in a polythene bag, which is then sealed and dispatched to a
laboratory for processing. It is important to take a reasonable number of
random samples, and one method is to traverse the pasture and remove
four grass samples at intervals of about four paces until approximately 400
have been collected (Figure 15.13). Another, primarily for lungworm
larvae, is to collect a similar number of samples from the close proximity
of faecal pats. At the laboratory, the grass is thoroughly soaked, washed
and dried and the washings containing the larvae passed through a sieve
(aperture 38 μm; 600 to 1 inch) to remove fine debris. The material
retained on the sieve is then Baermanised and the infective larvae are
identified and counted microscopically under the high power. The
aeqau pep jo ay lad eT se pessadxa are quasaid sraqunu
Fig. 15.13 Butterfly route.
1847
Where counts in excess of 1000 L3/kg of ruminant gastrointestinal
trichostrongyles are recorded, the pasture can be regarded as moderately
infective and values of over 5000 L3/kg can be expected to produce
clinical disease in young animals during their first season at grass.
Although this is a useful technique for detecting the level of
gastrointestinal nematode L3 on pastures, it is less valuable for detecting
lungworm larvae because of the rapid fluctuations of these larvae on
pastures.
A more sophisticated technique, the Jorgensen method, which depends on
migration of larvae through an agar medium containing bile, is used in
some laboratories for estimating Dictyocauius larval populations on
pasture; since most lungworm larvae are concentrated close to faeces,
present state of knowledge, the detection of any lungworm larvae in
herbage samples should be regarded with suspicion and even a negative
finding does not necessarily imply that the pasture is free of infection.
1848
ECTOPARASITES
Arthropods of veterinary interest are divided into two major groups, the
InsectaandtheArachnida.Mostaretemporaryorpermanent
ectoparasites, found either in or on the skin, with the exception of some
flies whose larval stages may be found in the somatic tissues of the host.
Parasitic insects include flies, lice and fleas, while the two groups of
arachnids of veterinary importance are the ticks and mites. In all cases
diagnosis of infection depends on the collection and identification of the
parasite(s) concerned.

Adult dipteran flies visiting animals are usually caught either by netting or
after being killed by insecticides, while larvae may be collected in areas
where animals are housed or directly from animals where the larval stages
are parasitic. Identification of the common flies of veterinary interest, at
least to generic level, is fairly simple, the key characters being described
in the guide below. Identification of larvae to generic and species level is
rather more specialised and depends on examination of certain features
such as the structure of the posterior spiracles. Publications dealing with
this may be found in References and further reading.

Guide to third-stage larvae causing myiasis in domestic animals
The guide to larvae presented below applies specifically to recognition of
the third stage. This stage is usually of the longest duration and, since the
larvae are approaching their maximum size or are beginning to wander, is
usually the stage when they are most commonly observed. It should be
noted, that because the external structure of larvae may change over the
course of their growth and development, first- and second-stage larvae
may not key out appropriately.

LICE AND FLEAS
close examination; in the case of lice, the eggs, commonly known as
'nits', may also be found attached to the hair or feathers. Fleas may be
more difficult to detect, but the finding of flea faeces in the coat, which
appear as small dark pieces of grit and which, on contact with moist cotton
wool or tissue, produce a red coloration due to ingested blood, allow
confirmation of infection. Collection may be straightforward as in the case
of many lice, which may be brushed from the coat or removed by clipping
hairs or feathers. Fleas may be removed by brushing or vacuum cleaning.
Alternatively, in the case of small animals, the parasites may be readily
sprayed with an insecticide.The gross characteristics of biting and sucking
lice, and a key to the fleas, which are commonly found on domestic
animals are described below.
Guidetotherecognitionofcommonliceofveterinary importance
many genera are obscure. However, because lice in general are highly host
specific, in many cases information relating to the species of host and the
site of infestation will provide a reliable initial guide to identification. The
various species of lice are usually found in all geographical regions of the
world in which their host occurs.

engorged, but care should be taken in their removal since their mouthparts
are usually firmly embedded in the skin. The tick may be persuaded to
withdraw its mouthparts if a piece of cotton wool, soaked in anaesthetic, is
placed around it or, alternatively, if something hot is held near its body
One of the simplest methods used to recover ticks from pasture is to drag a
blanket over the ground to which the unfed ticks become attached as they
would to a host. Specific identification of the large variety of ticks which
parasitise domestic animals is a specialised task.

on examination of the external auditory canal using an auroscope or on
          
likewise, rigorous brushing of the coat and subsequent microscopic
examination of this material will usually confirm infection with
Cheyletiella. For the demonstration of some nonburrowing and burrowing
mites it is often necessary to obtain a skin scraping which is subsequently
1894
examined microscopically. The area selected for scraping should be at the
edge of a visible lesion and the hair over this area should be clipped away.
A drop of lubricating oil such as liquid paraffin is placed on a microscope
slide and a clean scalpel blade dipped in the oil before using it to scrape
the surface of a fold of affected skin. Scraping should be continued until a
slight amount of blood oozes from the skin surface and the material
obtained then transferred to the oil on the slide. A coverslip should then be
applied and the sample examined under low magnification (x10o). If
during this initial examination no mites are detected a further sample may
be heated on a slide with a drop of 10% caustic potash. After allowing this
preparation to clear for 5-10 minutes it should be re-examined
The identification of mites can be difficult. However, since mites in
general tend to be relatively host specific, a good first practical indication
of the likely identity of any species in question can be the species of host
and the location of the mite on that host. The following is a general guide
to the adults of the most common species and genera of ectoparasitic mites
likely to be encountered. It is important to note that this guide is not
comprehensive and if in doubt more specialist keys should be used.

PRESERVATION
Most adult arthropods and their developing stages may be preserved
satisfactorily in 70% alcohol in small glass or plastic tubes. A plug of
cotton wool should be pushed down the tube to limit damage during
transit and the tube firmly corked and labelled. Otherwise, the specimen
tube, but this is best left to the specialist for all but the largest flies.
PROTOZOAL
INFECTIONS
The laboratory diagnosis of protozoal diseases  is often relatively
straightforward and well within the scope of the general practitioner,
athough on other occasions it may require specialised techniques and long
experience. This section is concerned primarily with the former and
supplements the information already given in the general text.

EXAMINATION OF FAECAL
SAMPLES
The McMaster flotation method is the simplest technique for detecting the
presence and estimating the number of coccidial oocysts in faeces. The
technique is exactly the same as that described for helminthological
diagnosis although the small size of the oocysts makes the microscopic
examination more prolonged. If the animal has acute clinical signs of
coccidiosis, such as blood-stained faeces, and many thousands of oocysts
are present, one may reasonably consider that the diagnosis is confirmed.
Unfortunately, with the more pathogenic species of coccidia, clinical signs
may appear during the meroogonous phase or when oocyst production has
just started, so that a negative or low oocyst count does not necessarily
indicate that the clinical diagnosis was wrong. The oocyst count is also of
little value in the less acute coccidial infections associated with production
losses. In general, because of the limitations of the oocyst count, a
 postmortem examination, at least on poultry, is always advisable.
For the detection of intestinal protozoa such as Entamoeba, Giardia or
Balantidium, a small amount of fresh faeces may be mixed with warm
saline and examined under a warm-stage microscope for the presence of
trophozoites or cysts. However, their identification requires considerable
experience and faecal samples preserved in formalin or polyvinyl alcohol
may be sent to a specialist laboratory for confirmation.
The diagnosis of suspected Cryptosporidium infection depends on the
small thin-shelled oocysts appearing bright red.
EXAMINATION OF BLOODAND
LYMPH
Leishmann, and examined under an oil immersion lens are commonly
used for the detection of trypanosomes, babesial and theilerial piroplasms
and rickettsial infections such as anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis and
eperythrozoonosis. On other occasions, needle biopsies of enlarged lymph
1908
nodes may be similarly stained for the detection of trypanosomes
(especially Trypanosoma brucei or T. vivax) or theilerial schizonts.
[n trypanosomosis, the parasitaemia may be light and the chance of a
positive diagnosis is increased if a thick blood film, dehaemoglobinised by
immersing the slide in water before eosin staining, is used. For this a drop
of fresh blood, with no added anticoagulant, is gently stirred on a slide to
cover an area of about 10 mm diameter and allowed to dry. Subsequently
It may be stained by Field's technique as follows.
Preparation of solutions:
Solution A Methylene blue0.4 g
Azure I
0.25 g
Solution B
250 ml
Solution B Na2HPO412H2O 25.2 g
KH2PO4
12.5 g
Distilled water
1000 ml
Solution C Eosin
0.5g
Solution B
250 ml
These solutions do not keep and should be freshly prepared each day.
(1) Dip slide in solution A 1-3 seconds
(2) Rinse in solution B 2-3 seconds
(3) Dip slide in C
13 seconds
(4) Rinse in tap water 2-3 seconds
(S) Stand upright to drain and dry.
This technique is commonly used in large-scale survey work in the field.
earlier in the text, is the examination, under darkground illumination, of
the expressed buffy coat of a microhaematocrit tube for the detection of
motile trypanosomes.
Trypanosoma congofense or T. brucei infection is another common
technique practised in the field. Three days later the tail blood of such
1909
mice should be examined and subsequently daily thereafter for about 3-4
weeks to establish if trypanosomes are present.
The detection of specific antibody in a specialist laboratory may also be
useful in the diagnosis of several protozoal diseases such as theileriosis,
trypanosomosis, including T. cruzi infection, babesiosis, cryptosporidiosis
and rickettsial infections such as anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis. However
a positive result does not necessarily imply the presence of a still active
infection, but simply that the animal has at some time been exposed to the
pathogen. An exception to this interpretation is the diagnosis of suspected
toxoplasmosis in sheep, where rising antibody levels over a period of
several weeks are reasonable evidence of recent and active infection.
EXAMINATIONOFSKIN
Histological examination of skin biopsies or scrapings from the edges of
skin ulcers, suspected to be due to leishmaniosis, may be used to
demonstrate the amastigote parasites in the macrophages.
In dourine, caused by Trypanosoma equiperdum, fluid extracted from the
cutaneous plaques usually offers a better chance of detecting
trypanosomes than blood smears.
Finally, although not within the province of the general practitioner, the
use of xenodiagnosis as a diagnostic technique should be noted. This is
used to detect protozoal infections such as babesiosis, thieleriosis or
Trypanosoma cruzi infection where the parasite cannot be found easily. It
consists of allowing the correct intermediate host, such as a tick or a
haematophagous bug, to feed on the animal. These arthropod vectors
have, of course, to be reared in the laboratory so that they are free from
infection. After feeding, the arthropod host is maintained for several
weeks to allow any ingested organisms to multiply, after which it is killed
and examined for evidence of infection. Although a valuable technique,
especially for the detection of carrier states, the method has the
