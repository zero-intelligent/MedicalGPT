Companion animal practice is an ever-changing field. As new research
and experience broaden our knowledge, changes in practice, treatment,
and drug therapy may become necessary or appropriate. Readers are advised
to check the most current product information provided by the manufacturer
of each drug to be administered to verify the recommended dose, method and
duration of administration, and contraindications. It is the responsibility of the
practitioner, relying on his/her own experience and knowledge of the patient,
to make diagnoses, to determine best treatment and dosages for each individual
patient, and to take all appropriate safety precautions. Neither the publisher
 nor the author assumes any liability for any injury and/or damage to persons
or property related to use of material contained in this book.

The cranial lobar vessels are easiest to evaluate

pushes the CaVC-heart juncture dorsally, causing a
more horizontal CaVC orientation.

 The diameter of the CaVC is approximately that
of the descending thoracic aorta, although its size
changes with respiration. Persistent widening of the
CaVC suggests increased caval pressure and can be
seen with RV failure, cardiac tamponade, pericardial

have an asymmetric or concurrent ventral distribution

usually have an uneven and patchy distribution of
opacities, which either extends throughout the lung
fields or is concentrated in the middle zones (64, 65).
Other classic patterns of pulmonary infiltrate

pulmonary edema tends to be bilateral and

EVALUATION OF THE PLEURAL SPACE
PLEURAL EFFUSION
As free pleural fluid accumulates between lung lobes,
wedge-shaped areas of soft tissue/fluid opacity that
'point’ toward the center of the chest become visible.
On a lateral view, ventral opacity (fluid) separates the
lungs from the sternum. On DV/VD views, this opacity
separates the lung lobes from each other and the chest
wall (66-68). The cardiac silhouette is better visualized
on a VD view because the fluid collects at the dorsal
aspect of the thorax; however, this position may
exacerbate respiratory distres. Large volume pleural
effusion causes partial lung collapse, rounding of lobar
borders, and silhouetting of the cardiac and mediastinal
shadows. Pleural fluid and reduced lung expansion

Ventricular fibrillation
This lethal rhythm is characterized by multiple
reentrant circuits causing chaotic electrical activity in
the ventricles (98). Consequently, like the atria during

activity and cannot function as a pump. Ventricular

Escape complexes and rhythms
Escape complexes occur after a pause in the dominant
(usually sinus) rhythm. If the sinus rhythm does not
resume, the escape focus continues to fire at its own
intrinsic rate. Escape rhythms are usually regular.
Escape activity can originate from automatic cells in
the atria, the AV junction, or the ventricles (100, 101).
Ventricular escape rhythms (idioventricular rhythms)
99
usually occur at a rate <40-50 beats/minute in the dog
and <100 beats/minute in the cat. Junctional escape
rhythms usually range from 40-60 beats/minute in the
dog. Because escape activity is a cardioprotective
mechanism, escape complexes and escape rhythms
should not be suppressed with antiarrhythmic drugs.

Diastolic RV wall thickness should be <50% (and
usually ~33%) of LV wall thickness. Measurements
in cats (Table 15) are relatively consistent. Because of
breed and body size-related variation, standardized
values for normal dogs are more problematic (Table
16, pp. 72-73).

CONTRAST ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
Contrast echocardiography or “bubble study’ is a
technique used in 2-D modalitiy (and, occasionally, in
 M-mode modality) in which a substance containing
‘microbubbles’ is rapidly injected either into a
peripheral vein or selectively into the heart. The passage

DOPPLER MODES
Several types of Doppler echocardiography are used
clinically: pulsed wave (PW), continuous wave (CW),
and color flow (CF) mapping. PW and CW are also
 known as spectral Doppler.
Pulsed wave Doppler
PW Doppler uses short bursts of ultrasound to
interrogate a specified area, designated the sample
volume, distant to the transducer. This is known as
range gating. Its advantage is that blood flow velocity,
direction, and spectral characteristics can be
calculated from a specific location in the heart or
61
blood vessel (158-161). The main disadvantage is that
the maximum measurable velocity is limited by the
transmitted frequency, the sample volume's distance
from the transducer and by the pulse repetition
PW:2.5MHz
 frequency (PRF). The PRF relates to the time required
to send, receive, and process echos returning from the
selected location as discreet pulses. Twice the PRF (or
the Nyquist limit) defines the maximum measurable
velocity, which is influenced by the transmitted
 frequency and the distance of the sample volume from
the transducer.

PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Functional closure of the ductus arteriosus normally
 r  re   
over days to weeks cause permanent closure. Animals
with inherited PDA have a histologically abnormal
ductal wall that is unable to constrict&, 54. Closure at
only the pulmonary side of the ductus causes a ductus
diverticulum from the aorta but no shunt; this “forme
fruste’ (incomplete form) of inherited PDA is seen
54. With a fully patent ductus, blood shunts from the
277
descending aorta to the pulmonary artery during both
systole and diastole, because aortic pressure normally
is higher throughout the cardiac cycle (276, 277). This
left-to-right shunt creates a volume overload on the
pulmonary circulation, LA, and LV. Shunt flow
depends on the pressure gradient between the two
circulations and the ductus diameter. Rarely, an
aorticopulmonary window, between the ascending
aorta and the pulmonary artery, or other central A-V
fistula causes similar hemodynamic and clinical
abnormalitiesss, 56. Hyperkinetic arterial pulses are
characteristic of PDA because blood run-off from the
 aorta to the pulmonary system allows diastolic aortic
pressure to decrease rapidly and widens pulse pressure
(278; see also Chapters 1 and 2).

 Echocardiography reveals left heart dilation, with

Larger defects can usually be visualized just below the
aortic valve in the right parasternal long-axis plane. The
septal tricuspid leaflet is located to the right of the
defect. Because echo “drop-out' is common at the thin
membranous septum, more than one scanning plane
should be used to evaluate a suspected VSD. Supporting
clinical evidence and a murmur consistent with VSD
should also be sought. Doppler studies demonstrate the
shunt flow and, in some cases, aortic regurgitation
(289-294). Cardiac catheterization, oximetry, and

sometimes replaced with isotonic fluid, to maintain the
PCV at a level where clinical signs are minimal (see

Therapy involves surgical division of the ligamentum

PRAA. Some dogs have a coexisting retroesophageal
left subclavian artery or left aortic arch (possibly
atretic), which must also be identified and divided for a
successful outcome121. A thoracoscopic technique also
has been reported122 Medical management consists of
giving frequent, small, semisolid or liquid meals in an
upright position for an indefinite time. Most dogs
become clinically normal after successful surgery, but
some experience persistent regurgitation, indicating a
permanent esophageal motility disorder123
COR TRIATRIATUM
359
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
This uncommon malformation is caused by an
abnormal membrane that divides the right (dexter) or
va
left (sinister) atrium into two chambers. There are
several reports of cor triatriatum dexter (CTD) in
dogs124-128. Cor triatriatum sinister has only been
described rarely (cat)1 129. The intraatrial membrane
of CTD results from failure of the embryonic right
sinus venosus valve to regress. The caudal vena cava
and coronary sinus empty into the caudal RA
chamber; the tricuspid orifice is within the cranial RA
chamber. Obstruction to venous flow through the
abnormal membrane increases hydrostatic pressure
within the caudal vena cava and abdominal structures.
360
CLINICAL FEATURES
Large to mid-sized breeds of dog are most often
affected with CTD. Development of persistent ascites
at an early age is the most prominent clinical sign (see
193, p. 121). Exercise intolerance, lethargy, distended
cutaneous abdominal veins, and, sometimes, diarrhea
are also reported (357). Neither a cardiac murmur nor
jugular venous distension are features of this anomaly.

1) Major criteria (3 points each]:*
a) LV dilation: systolic or diastolic dimension exceeding 959%o confidence intervals for the individual or other breed-specific
reference ranges.
b) Increased LV sphericity: ratio of LV diastolic chamber length (from apex to mitral annulus; obtained using right parasternal
long axis 4-chamber view) to [V diastolic short-axis dimension (from M-mode) of <1.65.
c) ■ Reduced LV fractional shortening: <20-25%o (depending on breed-specific reference values; M-mode); and/or
 Reduced LV ejection fraction: <40%o (from 2-D long-axis view optimized for LV size).
2) Minor criteria (1 point each):
a) Arrhythmia: where it is strongly associated with DCM in the specific breed (e.g. ventricular ectopy in Boxers or Doberman
Pinschers); other causes should be actively excluded.
b] Atrial fibrillation.
c) Increased mitral valve EPSS (from M-mode).
d) Increased preejection PEP:ET ratio: exceeding 95%o confidence intervals (e.g. >0.4).
e) IV fractional shortening in equivocal range: depends on breed-specific reference values (from M-mode).
f) Left or biatrial enlargement.
Total score of 6 or more points is consistent with DCM once other cardiac and systemic disease is excluded.
Total score of 1 to 5 points should prompt serial reevaluation for evidence of progression.

result from increasing LA pressure. Geomeric changes
in the LV and papillary muscles as well as abnormal
systolic mitral valve motion can interfere with normal
valve closure. Secondary MR exacerbates the increased
LA volume and pressure. LV volume is normal or
decreased; reduced ventricular volume results in lower
stroke volume and may contribute to NH activation.
Higher HRs further interfere with LV filling, exacerbate
myocardial ischemia, and promote pulmonary venous
congestion and edema by shortening the diastolic filling

PERICARDIAL DISEASES AND CARDIAC TUMORS

Other diagnostic techniques such as pneumo-

pericardiography and angiocardiography may be
helpful in identifying cardiac tumors, although
echocardiography has largely replaced these tests
(536, 537). Although differentiation of neoplastic

reactive mesothelial cels in the effusion39, lymphoma
and some other tumors can occasionally be diagnosed
by pericardial fluid evaluation.
MANAGEMENT
Pericardiocentesis is indicated immediately for cardiac
tamponade (see 
 p. 327). Conservative management,
with pericardiocentesis as needed, is used in some
patients until episodes of cardiac tamponade become
537
unmanageable. Whether antinflammatory doses of a
glucocorticoid are of benefit is unclear. Surgical subtotal
pericardiectomy prevents recurrent tamponade but may
facilitate metastatic dissemination throughout the
 thoracic cavity; however, this does not appear to affect
survival time with HSA or mesotheliomar7. Balloon
pericardiotomy (see p. 328) may provide a less invasive
alternative to surgery in some patients, but this
 procedure is not recommended with HSA, as this tumor
is quite friable. Because heart base tumors (e.g.
chemodectoma) tend to be slow growing, partial
pericardiectomy,  or pericardiotomy, may  prolong
survival of affected dogs for months to years. Because of
local invasion with this and other tumors, complete
surgical resection is rarely possible. Nevertheless, some
tumors may be amenable to surgical resection,
depending on their location and invasiveness0-52?

 prevalence of this in dogs is unknown2, 37.
Signs of right-sided heart failure can be a
