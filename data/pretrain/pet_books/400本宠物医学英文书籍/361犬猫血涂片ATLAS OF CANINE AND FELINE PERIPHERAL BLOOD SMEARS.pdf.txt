INTRODUCTION:
BLOOD SMEAR PREPARATION
ANDEXAMINATION
Overview
Evaluafion of blood smears is a fundamental step in overall health assessment and is included in stan-
 dard hematologic profles and as part of the diagnostic evaluation of virtually every ill patient. In addi-
fion to being a means of obtaining the differenfial white blood cell (WBC) count (i.e., determination of
the distribution of the different types of leukocytes, both as percenfages and counts per microliter [μL]),
blood smear examination may yield a broad range of diagnostic information. For example, altered red
blood cell (RBC) morphology may suggest chronic blood loss, exposure to endogenous and exogenous
toxins, disorders of vasculafure, or immune-mediated hemolysis. Changes in WBC morphology may be
the earliest laboratory finding of inflammation and may be diagnostic for certain inherited conditions
and leukemias. Some changes occur in leukocyte mafurity, morphology, and type that may orly be
detected through microscopic evaluation of peripheral blood smears (i.e., neutrophilic leff-shift, neutro-
philic toxic change, and the presence of circulating mast cells). In some cases, infectious agents, pathog-
nomonic cellular inclusions, and neoplastic cells are observed on blood films, yielding an immediate,
Blood smear evaluation should be performed as part of every complete blood count (CBC), either
in-house or in arl outside laboratory. Evaluafion provides morphologic corfirmafion of hematologic
parameters, assurance of the qualify of values obtained from automated analyzers, and additional impor-
fant irformafiorn not given by auitomated methods. The vale of blood smear review is maximized when
the information is correlated with the patient's medical history, current and previous laboratory findings,
and physical examination findings.
 Blood smear preparation is easy and inexpensive, and experience in evaluation is readily acquired
with adequate background information and regular practice. This introduction describes applicable
techniques and interpretations of canine and feline blood smears. A brief introduction to the integration
of findings from blood smear evaluations with other values in the CBC is included.
Equipment and Supplies
An essential piece of equipment for blood smear evaluation is a well-maintained, binocular microscope
with high-quality 10, 20, 40 or 50 (ideally, oil-immersion 50×), and 100× (oil-immersion) objectives. Addi-
tionally, clean glass slides and good-quality, fresh stains and Coplin jars are needed for in-house
staining.
 Standard plain or frosted glass slides may be used directly from the package without special treatment
or clearing. Slides with frosted ends facilifate labeling wifh pafient informafion. Slide surfaces should
be free of dust, fingerprints, and residue from detergent, alcohol, or tap water. The use of special cytologic
adhesives may result in background staining and are not recommended. Arn ample supply of slides
facilitates preparafion of multiple smears per sample, avoiding the frustration of interprefting any poorly
made smears. These additional smears may also be reserved for alternafive types of staining or, if indi-
cated, a specialist's review.
 Sample Collection
Ideally, blood samples should be collected on the first afftempt from a medium to large vein of a calm
patient. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is the preferred anficoagulant for blood used in cyto-
logic preparafions. The liquid form of EDTA disperses more rapidly ir samples and may be preferable

is accomplished by gently inverting the tube 6 to 10 times. Alternatively, blood without an anticoagulant
may be placed directly from the collection needle onto the slide. This is preferred by some because of
possible morphologic alterafions caused by the EDTA and is parficularly useful if sample volume is
limited. Samples collected from superficial skin-puncfure wounds, clipped toenails (due to excessive
contaminafion wifth tissue procoagulants), and blood anficoagulated with heparin (a relatively poor
preservative of cellular morphology and staining characteristics) are less acceptable. Blood anticoagu-

sample dilution interferes with cell count estimates.
Collection of blood in proper proporion to anticoagulant is facilitated by the use of commercial vacu-
fainers. This is essential to avoid certain artifacts of cell morphology and also to achieve accurate cell
counts, which may be affected by overfilling and underfilling the fube.
Smear Preparation
The goal of blood smear preparation is to spread the cells (RBC, WBC, and platelets), so a large,
infrequently touching, and should be devoid of large spaces without cells. In the monolayer, WBCs
flatten and stain well, allwing good evaluation of cytoplasmic and nuclear detail. WBCs will be
evenly distributed, allowing accurate differential counts to be performed and promoting examination
of WBC, RBC, and platelet morphologies. Inclusions such as rickeftsial and viral inclusions may be
readily idenfified. In thick areas of the smear, cells offen are foo confracted, distorted, and poorly
stained for reliable evaluation. In excessively fhin areas of fhe smear and in the feafhered edge, cells are
 often distorted, damaged, and ruptured, prohibiting reliable classification and morphologic evaluation.
 Also, a differential WBC count performed near or in the feathered edge results in skewing toward the
larger cell types.
Well-made smears are essential for reliable identification, quantification, and evaluation of periph-
eral blood cells. Smears may be prepared on glass slides or coverslips. The glass slide technique is
generally easier and more reliable than preparing smears on coverslips. Glass slides may also be pro-
cessed fhrough automatic stainers and are most suitable for laboratories using suich equipmenf.
However, the coverslip method generally results in more uniform WBC distribution and less frauma tfo
fragile blood components such as large or neoplastic cells. For both methods, blood samples should be
fresh and adequately mixed just prior to smear preparation, and smears should be completely air-dried
before staining.
The blood smear preparafior techrique should be learned well, as ift is necessary for reliable in-house
blood smear examination and hemogram results from samples submifted to referral laboratories. At least
one freshly prepared (in-house) blood smear should accompany all EDTA-anficoagulated blood samples
submifted fo referral laborafories for CBC. Failure to submit a premade blood smear may result in several
artifacts; for example, blood parasites (e.g., Mycoplasma hemofelis) may fall off the RBC surfaces, resulting
decreased; and WBCs become pyknotic (secondary to aging), and when 10% or more of the WBCs are
 pyknotic, the differential count is invalid.
 Smears are prepared on glass slides by placing a drop of blood (2 to 3 mm in diameter) on fhe broad
face of the slide about 1 to 1.5 cm from the frosted border (or edge of a nonfrosted slide). Another clean,
dry slide (spreader slide) is held loosely against fhe surface of the first slide af a 30-degree angle
and drawn smoothly toward the blood drop. The spreader slide should be brought to a position
where if just meets, but is not drawn into, the blood drop. When fhe spreader slide makes contact with
the blood, capillary acfion immediately distributes the blood between the fwo slides. Then, with no
downward pressure, the spreader slide is quickly and smoothly swept across the remaining length of
the underlying slide.
Ideally, blood smears have a smooth transition from the thick region to the feathered edge and cover

blunt instead of feathered, the second slide was probably raised off the first before the blood was spread
completely. Unequal smear thickness usally results from the spreader slide being held at too obtuse an
angle or placing too much pressure on the first slide while spreading the blood. Too much pressure on
the second slide may also result in WBCs clumping along the smear's feathered edge. Too liffle pressure
may result in short, fhick smears. Smear thickness may also be affected by the viscosity of the blood

may be necessary for preparing smears of severely hemoconcentrated blood. Smears need to be thor-
 Oughly air-dried before staining; those that are thick may require additional drying time (and additional
time in fixafive and stain).
Common problems in blood smear technique include unclean slides, placing too large a drop of blood
or the blood smear slide, pulling the prep slide too far back, excessive pressure, slow movement of the
prep slide forward, and jerky or uneven forward movement of the prep slide.
 Unclean microscope slides may cause spaces devoid of cells to be scaftered throughout the smear,
prohibit smooth movement of fhe prep slide, and impair the stairing of porfions or the enfire smear.
Using a drop of blood that is too large causes the smear to be too thick and to extend too far down
the blood smear slide. Often, the blood smear extends to the end of the slide without formation of a
monolayer, precluding reliable microscopic examination.
Pulling the prep slide too far back causes blood to flow underneath the prep slide. When the prep
pass back under the prep slide more easily than do larger cells (ie., neufrophils and monocytes). As a
result, WBCs are unevenly distributed with small lymphocytes being in excess in the earlier formed
portion of the smear and neutrophils and monocytes being in excess in the later formed portion of the
smear (ie., feathered edge). Obviously, these smears may give misleading differential WBC counts.
Excessive pressure on the prep slide cauises uneven WBC spreading, where most of the WBCs become
concentrated at the feathered edge. Also, with extreme pressure it may be difficult to rapidly and
smoothly move the prep slide forward. Thus, excessive pressure may lead to irregular smears and
uneven distribufion of WBC types, resulting in inaccurate differenfial WBC counts.
Stains
 As with cytologic preparations, Romanowsky-type stains (Wright; Wright-Giemsa) are good general
stains for microscopic blood smear evaluation. Quick Romanowsky-type stains (Diff-Quik) are advan-
tageous because they are less sensifive to solufion pH and staining fime and less susceptible to precip-
itate formation compared with Wright stains. However, most quick stains are also less effective af
demonstrating polychromasia of immafure erythrocytes, granules in some cells (i.e., granular lympho
cytes and mast cells), and toxic change in neutrophils. Thus, whenever possible, Wright stains are
preferred.
 Different brands of Wright and Wright-Giemsa stains are available, and following the manufacturer's
staining protocol for each fype is advised. In general, staining is achieved by first dipping the air-dried
slides into a methanol-containing Coplin jar for fixation (approximately 30 seconds). After fixation, the
slides are dipped into Coplin jars containing the stain reagent. Some manufacturers have one type
of stain reagert, others have fwo. Affer stairing, fhe slides are dipped into Coplin jars containing
buffer and then rinsed with water (tap, deionized, or a combination of tap and deionized water). The
slides may be dried by blotting with bibulous paper or placed upright on an absorptive surface
to hasten drying. A blow dryer set on low power and held 8 to 10 inches from the slide also shortens
drying time.
Quick stain methods vary somewhat and should be used according to manufacturer's recommenda-
tions. Diff-Quik requires three separate solutions: (1) an alcohol fixative, (2) a methylene blue dye
mixfure, and (3) an eosin-confaining solufion. The smear is slowly dipped and slightly swished five or
more fimes into each solufion in sequence, with one edge of the slide briefly blofted befween solufions.
For each step, the fluid should drain smoothly off the slide between dips, with no bubbling or uneven-
ness, before proceeding to fhe next solufion. Tap or distilled water is used to rinse the slide affer the last
solution and before air-drying.
Hematologic Reference Intervals
 Reference intervals, which are found in publications and texts, provided by a reference laboratory, or
provided by manufacfurers of bench-top analyzers, are generally reliable. Certair physiologic factors
occasionally cauise a healthy pafient's hematologic values to deviate from reference intervals. For example,
very young animals are rapidly expanding their vascular space and tend to have relatively low hemato-
crits. Yourg animals are also acfively replacing fetal RBCs with adult RBCs and also have greater eryth-

excited or vigorously exercised patients, especially if they are immafure. This epinephrine-induced
response may also result in temporarily increased counts of other WBC types in the peripheral blood of
healthy patients. At least one canine breed, the Greyhound (and potentially other sight hounds as well),
has hematologic reference intervals reported to fall slighfly outside of reference intervals commorly used
for the species. Although fhese normal physiologic conditions should be considered, they generally
explain less than 5% of the pafient values that fall outside reference intervals for any single hematologic
result.

BLOODSMEARS
BloodSmears
DISTINcTIvE FEATUREs: Blood smears have three major areas: (1) the thick inner area (body); (2) the
monolayer; and (3) the feathered edge (the most external area). The inner area is the thickest area of
the smear, and cells are usually too confracted, distorted, or poorly stained for reliable evaluafion. The
monolayer is the best area for cell morphology evaluation and differential cell counts, whereas the feath-
ered edge is the best area to search for orgarisms (i.e., microfilaria), clumped platelets, and large atypical
cells, neoplastic cells, or both. Blood smears should have a smooth fransifion in thickness from the
proximal end to the distal end of the smear and have an adequate monolayer for evaluafion of cell dis-
fribution and morphology. The monolayer is found within fhe distal half of the smear adjacent to the
feathered edge and is luminescent when the unstained slide is held under indirect light.
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Iritially, the entire smear should be quickly scarned using the 10 or 20x
objective from the thickest region to the feathered edge. At this low magnification, blood films may be
checked for staining, overall thickness, smooth transitions in thickness, cell distribufion, adequacy of the
A pafient's hematocrit may be crudely estimated by examining a blood smear at low magrificafion.
 This estimate assumes that smear thickness was not increased or decreased to compensate for anemia
or hemoconcentration by increasing or decreasing the angle of the spreader slide. Blood films from
nonanemic animals generally have red blood cells (RBCs) that are closely apposed in the monolayer as
well as several RBC layers at the thick end of the smear that obstruct penefrance of most of the condenser
light. In confrast, smears from animals that are moderately to markedly anemic usually have RBCs that
are widely separated from one another in the monolayer and only one to two RBC layers in the thick
 end of the smear that allow considerable condenser light to penetrate. In smears prepared from hemo-
 concentrated specimens, the monolayer will occupy a relatively smaller zone and cells may be crowded
and difficult to evaluate. Estimafes should ultimately be checked against the pafient's measured hema-
tocrit or packed cell volume (PCV).

most reliably evaluated. White blood cells (WBCs) should be fairly uniformly distributed within this
region. WBC estimates, differential platelet estimates, and examinafion of WBC, RBC, and platelet mor
phologies should be done in the monolayer. In the monolayer, WBCs flaften and stain well, allowing
good evaluation of cytoplasmic and nuclear detail. Also, inclusions such as rickettsial and viral inclusions
 may be readily identified.
 On a wellmade blood smear, the total WBC and differential cell counts may be estimated or simply
classified as low, normal, or high by examining fhe monolayer of the smear using the 40x or 50x objec-
tive, whereas platelet frequency is best estimated using the 100x objective.

GENERAL ASSESSMENT
Feathered Edge
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: The feathered edge is the genfly tapered end of the smear, located opposite the
point of application of the blood drop.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Large strucfures such as platelet clumps, microflaria, cells containing
infectious agents, and large, normal or neoplastic nucleated cells may be concentrated in this area. Thus, 
microscopic examination of the feathered edge is essential.
If large platelet clumps are found at the feathered edge, this may account for a low or low-normal
platelet estimate in the monolayer when evaluating platelet numbers and may also indicate that an
instrumenf-generafed platelet count may not be valid. Large neoplastic rucleated cells may be found in
low or high numbers in this area, suggesting leukemia or circulating neoplastic cells from nonhemato-
poietic neoplasia (i.e., mast cell tumor and lymphoma). Large parasites, in particular, microfilaria, may
be located in this region as well. Cells with intracellular orgarisms such as leukocytes containing Histo-
plasma organisms and RBCs containing Babesia spp. hemoparasites may concentrate in the feathered edge.
A differenfial WBC count may be inaccurately skewed toward larger cell types if the differenfial is per
formed mostly at the feathered edge. Also, in the feathered edge, cells are often distorted, damaged, or 
rupfured, prohibiting reliable classificafion and morphologic evaluation.
 If excessive pressure is applied to the spreader smear during smear preparation, most of the nucleated
cells will end up in the feathered edge of the smear. Estimates of the total WBC count and determination
of percenfages of the differenf types of leukocytes based only on examinafion of fhe monolayer of the
smear will be inaccurate. A total WBC count may be aftempted by evaluating the number of nucleated
cells in the feathered edge and monolayer of the smear at 10x magrificatiorn.

Cytoplasmic Fragments
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: With some acute leukemias, the background may contain cytoplasmic fragments
(sometimes called lymphoglandular bodies) formed from rapidly dividing or rupfured neoplastic cells.
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: These are characterized by small, basophilic, anucleate blebs that could be
mistaken for platelets. If cyfoplasmic fragments are found, assess the slide carefully for circulating neo-

cytes). Carine red blood cells (RBCs) are approximately 7 micrometers (μm) in diameter and shaped like
biconcave discs with prominent central pallor. Feline erythrocytes are smaller, approximately 6 μm in
 diameter, and more "cup" shaped, so they lack the prominent central pallor seen in canine RBCs.

Anemia
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Anemia is a decrease in rumbers of RBCs compared wifh established reference
intervals and can be estimated by blood smear evaluafion or quanfitated by RBC count, hemoglobin
concenfraftion, and measturement of the hematocrit.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Two general mecharisms of anemia, each with several etiologies, exist.
The first mecharism is decreased RBC production from bone marrow failure or disease. Differenfials
could include immune-mediated mechanisms, toxins, drug effects, infectious agents (feline leukemia
virus [FeLV], Ehrlichia spp.), endocrine disease, chronic liver and renal disease, and neoplasia (primary
bone marrow neoplasia or metastatic neoplasia). The second major mechanism of anemia is increased
RBC loss, which could be secondary to immune-mediated RBC destrucfion, hemolysis (viral, bacterial,
or ehrlichial infections; RBC fragmentation; oxidative RBC damage), and acute and chronic blood loss 
(coagulopathies, trauma, blood sucking endoparasites and ectoparasites).
NEXT sTEPs: When anemia is diagnosed, careful blood smear assessment of RBC morphology and
investigation for hemoparasifes are imporfant for classifying the anemia and idenfifying the cause
and to assess for evidence of RBC regenerafion. Additionally, evaluafion of platelet numbers and 
morphology and the white blood cell (WBC) line may help idenfify important etiologies of anemia.

Polycythemia
DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Polycythemia is an increase in the number of RBCs compared wifh established
reference intervals and may be estimated by blood smear evaluation or quantitated by RBC count,
hemoglobin concenfrafion, and measurement of the hematocrit.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: The most common cause of polycythemia in dogs and cats is hemocon-
cenfrafion secondary to decreased plasma volume (dehydration and endotoxic shock). A mild or moder-
ate fransient polycythemia may be secondary to epinephrine release (from exciftement or fright), resulting
 in splenic contraction, especially in the dog. The last major category is from increased RBC production,
which may be physiologically appropriate and inappropriate. Appropriate erythroid production is in
response to hypoxia primarily secondary to cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, or both. Animals living
at high altiftudes and some canine breeds (Greyhound and other sight breeds) also have greater hema-
tocrit values. Inappropriate polycythemia may result from inappropriate production of erythropoietin
(responsible for stimulating RBC production in the marrow), as from renal cysts or fumors and some
other types of neoplasia. Lastly, polycythemia vera (primary bone marrow neoplasia or leukemia) results
 in increased RBC production independent of erythropoietin.
NEXT sTEPs: When polycythemia is identified, dehydration must first be excluded by physical exami-
nation and by checking blood chemistry parameters (total protein concentration, blood urea nitrogen
[BUN]) and a urinalysis (urine specific gravity). If polycythemia is not secondary to dehydration, is
persistent, and the pafient does not live at high altifudes and is not a sight hound breed, then assess-
ment for appropriate or inappropriate causes of increased RBC production should be considered and
 may include blood smear assessment, measurement of erythropoietin levels, bone marrow cytology.
 and exclusion of cardiac, pulmonary, and renal diseases.

 roll of coins, is called rouleaux and is secondary to the electrostatic association of RBCs. Rouleaux may
be seen in the thick area of the smear in healthy cats but should not be present in fhe monolayer of fhe
smear.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Rouleaux may be seen Occasionally in healthy dogs and especially cats.
Increased rouleaux formafion is occasionally observed in sick or debilitated dogs and cats wifh increased
fibrinogen or globulin concentration. Rouleaux is generally associated with inflammatory conditions but
also in some norinflammafory condifions such as lymphoproliferafive disorders resulting in increased
globulin production. Lipemic blood samples may cause increased rouleaux as well.
NEXT STEPs: Careful aftention should be made to not confuse rouleaulx with RBC agglutination. Rou-
leaux are orderly linear stacks of RBCs, whereas RBC agglutination is formed by grapelike RBC
aggregates. To aid in differentiating between rouleaux and agglutination, a saline dilution test is
useful. Rouleaux may be easily dissociated by dilution of RBCs in saline, whereas true agglutination
persists despite saline dilution (for method, see Appendix). If rouleaux is confirmed, determine
plasma or serum total protein, albumin, globulin, fibrinogen values and lipemic index, and investigate
 potenfial causes of any abnormalifies found.

RED BLOOD CELLS
Agglutination
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Agglutinafion is a random, disorganized clumping of RBCs as opposed to the
 organized stack-of-coins formation seen with rouleaux formation. Agglutination is most prominent in
the body of the blood film (thick area) and may occur in this area as an artifact. Agglutinafion is signifi-
cant if found in the monolayer.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Agglutination occurs when antibodies on one RBC bind to anfigen on
other RBCs, forming globular to amorphous, grapelike aggregates of RBCs. When present, RBC agglu-
tination is supportive of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). Agglutination is not observed in
most cases of IMHA, but when present, ift occurs most commonly wifh immunoglobulin M (IgM) because
of its pentavalent nafure. However, exfremely heavy IgG antibody coating of RBC membranes may cauuse
NEXT sTEPs: If necessary, agglutinafion may be differenfiated from rouleaux formafion by performing
a saline dilution (dispersion) test. The presence of RBC agglutination warrants careful assessment of
the blood film for other supportive evidence of IMHA such as spherocytes, and also for underlying
causes of IMHA such as neoplastic cells and hemoparasites.

RED BLOOD CELLS
Polychromasia
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Polychromatophils are young, anucleate erythrocytes that stain both blue and
pink (hence polychromatophilic), making the cell appear gray or bluish-red with Romanowsky-type
stains. The blue color is caused by the presence of basophilic staining cellular organelles (ribosomes) thaf
are broken down within 12 to 24 hours after release from bone marrow. Typically, polychromatophilic
cells are larger fhan normochromic erythrocytes. Polychromatophil cells are counted as reficulocytes
when stained with new methylene blue (see next section).
to anemia. Hemorrhage and hemolysis are the two main causes of regenerative anemia and increased
numbers of polychromatophilic RBCs. Remember that polychromasia does not occur instanfly after
hemorrhage or hemolysis but takes 2 to 4 days to increase fhe number of polychromafophilic erythrocytes
 in peripheral blood and may not exceed the reference interval or achieve maximum values for 5 to 7
days. Therefore, early or acute hemorrhagic or hemolytic anemias may have minimal polychromasia.
Also, polychromafophilic RBCs are offten dificult to differenfiate from normochromic RBCs when smears
are stained with rapid stains (i.e., Diff-Quik).
In the cat, mild anemias fhat are regenerafive may have minimal or no polychromasia. The lack of
 obvious regeneration (reticulocytosis) does not rule out either hemorrhage or hemolysis. Potential causes
include early hemorrhage or hemolysis, immune-mediated disease directed at RBC precursors, and
recent transfusion, as well as anemia caused by multifactorial causes. If polychromasia is not evident in
a feline blood smear, a reficulocyte count is recommended, which is a more accurate way to determine
 regeneration in cats.
stains. Thus, if the onset of anemia is unknown, serial complete blood count (CBC) examinations may
be needed to evaluate for regeneration. Reticulocyte counts should also be performed in cases where
 regeneration is questioned.

REDBLOOD CELLS
Reticulocytes
DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: When immafure, anucleate erythrocytes are stained wifh a supravital stain such
as new methylene blue (NMB), the stain penetrates the RBC membrane and binds to the ribosomes,
staining them dark blue and causing them to clump, which idenfifies these cells as reticulocytes.
 The dog has only one identifiable form of reticulocytes in peripheral blood, called aggregate reticulo-
cytes. Cats, in contrast, have two: (1) punctate reticulocytes and (2) aggregate reticulocytes. Punctate
reticulocytes contain few, small, dotlike (punctate), blue-black structures (small polyribosome aggre-
gates) but no large aggregates of ribosomes. Aggregate reticulocytes contain one or more medium to
large, blue-black strucfures that may appear as a cluster or network of aggregated structures.
The clirical usefulness of punctate reticulocyte counts in cats remains unclear. Many laboratories and
all hematology instruments that report reticulocyte counts in cats, count and report only aggregate
reticulocytes. Manual reticulocyte counts are done by counting the nurmber of reticulocytes present in
1000 RBCs. The percentage is determined by dividing the number of reticulocytes counted by 10. The
absolute reticulocyte count is determined by multiplying the reticulocyte % by the RBC count. The degree
of reticulocytosis is best indicated by the absolute aggregate reticulocyte count (see the Appendix for
more information).
 Canine reticulocytes released from the bone marrow mature rapidly from aggregate reticulocytes to
mafure erythrocytes in approximately 24 hours. Punctate reticulocytes are present in low numbers in
dogs. Feline aggregate reticulocytes released from bone marrow mafure within 12 to 24 hours to the
erythrocytes.
 Usualy, good correlation exists between the degree of polychromasia observed on a blood film and
the aggregate reticulocyte numbers (with the exception of cats, see above). Punctate reticulocytes appear
the same as mafure eryfhrocytes on a Wright-stained blood film.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: The effectiveness of bone marrow response to anemia is determined by
the number of aggregate reticulocytes in dogs and cats. Regenerafive anemias occur secondary to blood
loss and IMHA if the bone marrow is healthy. Some heavy metal toxicities, in particular, lead poisoning.
result in excessive numbers (relative to the degree of anemia) of reticulocytes and nucleated RBCs
(nRBCs). A mild to moderate anemia may be seen typically only in chroric lead poisoning. Also, wifh
lead poisoning, basophilic stippling is noted within mature RBCs stained with Wright stain.
NEXT sTEPs: If the anemia is regenerative (above reference interval), top considerations include blood
nonregenerafive because of iron deficiency. If the anemia is not adequately regenerative, it should be
investigated if adequate ftime has elapsed for a regenerative response to have occurred. If deemed
 truly nonregenerative, further testing such as biochemical profle, urinalysis, and bone marrow cytol-
 ogy are indicated.

RED BLOOD CELLS
Hypochromia
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Hypochromic RBCs are excessively pale mafure erythrocytes with increased
central pallor, showing a gradual change from a pale central area to a light red periphery.
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Hypochromic RBCs are hemoglobin deficient mafure erythrocytes.
Increased hypochromia indicates iron deficiency anemia, which occurs secondary to low-grade, chronic
 blood loss. Iron deficiency anemia may be secondary to blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract (ulcers,
 neoplasia, parasites); blood loss in urine (urinary tract infection, calculi, or neoplasia); or external blood
loss from blood sucking ectoparasites (flas, ticks). Milk is low in iron; therefore, young, nursing animals 
are very susceptible to developing iron deficiency.
 NEXT STEPs: Hypochromic RBCs must be differenfiated from artifacts. Hypochromic RBCs show a
gradual change from red to pale. Artifacts appearing as punched-out centers wifth a sharp demarca-
tion from dark (red) to light (clear area) are called torocytes. Torocytes are artifacts and do not indicate
iron deficiency anemia. Dogs often develop hypochromic RBCs with iron deficiency anemia but feline
sources of chronic blood loss. An iron profile may also be considered.

Anisocytosis
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Variation in cell size is called anisocytosis. Normal erythrocytes may vary (larger
or smaller) up to one third of their size in normal animals.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Increased arisocytosis Occurs when significant rumbers of small-diameter
RBCs, large-dliameter RBCs, or a combination of both are present together with normal-dliameter RBCs.
 numbers of macrocytic polychromatophils in regenerative anemias.
NEXT sTEPs: The sigrificance of arisocytosis is dependenf on the rumbers of variably sized RBCs and
the specific morphology of the RBCs constituting the anisocytosis (i.e., spherocytes, polychromato-
phils, etc.).

Macrocytosis
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Macrocytosis secondary to reticulocytosis is expected in regenerative
anemias. Macrocytosis is abnormal when secondary to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infecfion in cats
(myelodysplastic syndrome, erythroleukemia) or inherited disorders such as macrocytosis of poodles
(poodle marrow dyscrasia).
 NEXT STEPs: When significant numbers of macrocytic RBCs are evident, investigate for a regenerative
anemia (expect concurrent polychromasia). In anemic cats with asynchronous regenerafion (i.e., large
number of nRBCs and absent or minimal polychromasia or reticulocytosis), consider FeLV testing to
aid in idenfification FeLV associated myelodysplastic syndrome. Check for breed-associated disorders
as well. Note that agglutination may cause a falsely increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV), sug-
 gesting macrocytosis; as aggregated RBCs are sometimes measured as a single RBC, careful examina-
tion of the blood film is important.

RED BLOOD CELLS
Microcytosis
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Microcytes are RBCs with reduiced cell volume compared with normal RBCs.
 DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Small RBCs may occur with acquired disorders (ie., iron deficiency
anemia, schistocytosis, bone marrow disorders); congenital disorders (i.e., familial dyserythropoiesis of
English Springer Spaniels), and hereditary disorders (i.e., microcytosis of Akita and Shiba Inu dogs).
Microcytes may be seen in both congenital and acquired liver disease, in particular liver shunts. MCV
may be artifacfually low if a short blood sample in an ethylenediaminetefraacetic acid (EDTA) tube is
evaluated (excess EDTA). Spherocytes are small-diameter cells, which are included in this section,
although these cells are not truly microcytic. Spherocytes may appear as small-cdiameter cells on a blood
smear; however, this is caused by their spheric shape, which conserves volume after removal of mem-
brane. Thus, spherocytes are nof considered by many to be frue microcytes.
NEXT sTEPs: When significant numbers of microcytes are evident on blood smear review, rule out
 iron deficiency anemia, IMHA, microangiopathy, liver disease, and check for breed-associated
disorders.

Poikilocytes
DISTINCTIvE FEATURES: Abnormally shaped RBCs are generically termed poikilocytes.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Many different forrms of poikilocytes exist, as well as many different cauuses
 of poikilocytosis; a few important causes include the following:
● In vifro artifactual changes (echinocytes and some acanthocytes)
●RBC fragmentation (schistocytes and keratocytes)
 Membrane loss (spherocytes)
● RBC membrane abnormalities (acanthocytes and stomatocytes)
The diagnostic significance of poikilocytes depends or which of the many different types are present
and, in some cases, is dependent on the numbers of affected RBCs (i.e., low numbers of Heinz bodies
may be normally seen in feline blood, but Heinz bodies are not normal in canine blood). Anemia is often
associated with poikilocytes and may range from mild to moderate or severe. Some of the more impor-
tant poikilocytes are discussed individually below.

RED BLOOD CELLS
Leptocytes: Target Cells (Codocytes) and Folded Red Blood Cells
 DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Leptocytes are thin erythrocytes and may appear as either target cells or folded
cells. Target cells have a dark central area surrounded by a clear area, which is then encircled by a dark
 peripheral region giving the appearance of a target. Folded cells have a fold in the membrane or have a
central bar of hemoglobin.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Occasional target cells are normalin the peripheralblood of dogs. Increased
numbers of target cells may be observed in blood from dogs with regenerafive anemia, and sometimes,
 polychromatophilic cells appear as target cells, folded cells, or both. Leptocytes may be seen in pathologic
states such as iron deficiency anemia, congerifal dyserythropoiesis, liver disease, or nephrotic
syndrome.
NEXI sTEPs: The presence of leptocytes should prompt investigafion into disorders such as iron
 deficiency anemia, IMHA, regenerative anemia, liver disease, and renal disease.

RED BLOOD CELLS
Spherocytes
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Spherocytes are small RBCs that are less than fwo thirds the diameter of normal
erythrocytes. As they are spherical and not disc shaped, they lack central pallor and appear dense, often 
fied, as in other areas of the smear artifacfual spherocytes may be presenf.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Spherocytes are fairly easy to recognize in dogs but are often impossible
to recognize in cats, as normal feline RBCs lack cenfral pallor. When spherocytes are observed in moder-
ate to high numbers, IMHA is the most likely cause. IMHA may be a primary (autoimmune mediated)
disease or a secondary disease (iniftiated by primary infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic condifions).
hemoparasitism, envenomation (i.e., snake bites and bee stings), zinc toxicity, microangiopathy and
neoplasia (i.e., lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma).
 NEXT STEPs: If significant numbers of spherocytes are present, look for RBC agglutination to support
the diagnosis of IMHA; if agglutinafion is not evident, consider Coombs test to lend addifional
support to the IMHA diagnosis. Even if autoagglutination is not evident and the Coombs test is nega-
tive, sigrificant numbers of spherocytes are still most likely secondary to IMHA. Carefully check for
hemoparasites, circulating neoplastic cells, evidence of neutrophil toxic changes, and other RBC mor-
 phologic abnormalities, especially if secondary IMHA is suspected.

Schistocytes (Fragmented Erythrocytes)
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Schistocytes are RBC fragments; they are smaller than normal RBCs, offten irregu-
lar and sometimes triangular in shape with pointed extremities.
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Schistocytes are commonly seen with microangiopathic hemolytic disease,
where erythrocytes hit fibrin strands, are cut, and their phospholipid membranes, upon touching, reseal,
resulting in circulating erythrocyte fragments.
 Schistocytes occur with many disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), myelo-
fibrosis, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, hemangiosarcoma, cardiac disease, and iron deficiency anemia.
Some of the RBC fragments will round up and become spherocytes; therefore, some spherocytes may be
seen along with schistocytes.
NEXT sTEPs: Investigate for microangiopafhic disease—especially vascular neoplasms of the liver and
spleen (hemangiosarcoma). Rule out DIC by evaluating a coagulation profile. To investigate iron
deficiency anemia, look for microcytic, hypochromic RBCs and investigate for a source of blood loss
(endoparasites, ectoparasites, hemafuria, gastrointestinal blood loss). Cardiac auscultation, electrocar-
 diography, heartworm testing, and echocardiography may be considered to assess for cardiac disease.

Keratocytes (Blister Cells and Helmet Cells)
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Keratocytes are mafure erythrocytes that contain single or multiple, intact or
rupfured, clear, peripheral circular areas. RBCs containing intact clear circular areas are sometimes called
 blister cells, whereas RBC containing clear circular areas that have ruptured resulting in one or two pro-
jections from the RBCs are sometimes called helmet cells.
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Keratocytes are forrmed by RBC traurma, very similar to schistocytes. Kera-
tocyte formafion is potenfiated in feline blood stored in EDTA anficoagulant. Keratocytes are seen in
various disorders associated with other RBC abnormalifies (i.e., acanthocytosis, echinocytosis) in dogs.
Keratocytes may be seen with various other disorders such as DIC, liver disease, vascular neoplasia (i.e.,
hemangiosarcoma), iron deficiency anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
NEXT sTEPs: Many of the same diseases resulting in RBC trauma fhat form schistocytes also cause
kerafocyte formafion (refer to above section on schistocytes).

Eccentrocytes (Hemighosts)
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Eccenfrocytes are mafure erythrocytes in which the hemoglobin is pushed to one
side of the cell leaving an opposing pale staining region.
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Eccentrocytes result from oxidative damage to the erythrocytes from inges-
tion of exogenous oxidants such as onions, garlic, acetaminophen, propylene glycol (some foods and
antifreeze solutions), zinc, and vitamin K antagonist intoxication. They may also be formed from elabora-
tion of endogenous oxidants in some very ill pafients with diseases such as diabetes mellifus.
NEXT STEPs: Check for other evidence of oxidative injury to RBCs such as the presence of
Heinz bodies. Finding eccentrocytes warrants investigation for oxidant ingestion and for underlying
disease.

DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Dense, irregularly contracted RBCs are formed by oxidative damage. Pyknocytes
look a lot like spherocytes and are offer differentiated by the company they keep (i.e., pyknocytes occur
wifh eccenfrocytes and may even form from eccenfrocytes). Some pyknocytes will have a membranous
tag unlike spherocytes, which are smooth and perfecfly round. Pyknocytes stain more intensely wifh
NMB stain compared with spherocytes.
DIAGNOsTIC  SIGNIFICANCE: Pyknocytes indicate oxidative injury and  generally  Occur  with

Acanthocytes (Spur Cells)
DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Acanthocytes are RBCs with multiple, irregular projections that are randomly
spaced. Acanthocytes contrast to echinocytes in that acanthocyte projections are randomly spaced, and
echinocyte projections are regularly spaced.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Acanthocytes may occur in dogs and cats with liver, spleric, or renal dis-
orders. Acanthocytes are important, as fhey are offten seen in the peripheral blood of pafients with
vascular neoplasms, in parficular hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Acanthocytes may also be seen
with DIC and lymphoma.
NEXT STEPs: Make sure to differenfiate acanthocytes from echinocytes. If true acanthocytes are present,
top considerafions include an underlying vascular neoplasm, parficularly involving fhe liver and
spleen.

Stomatocytes
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Stomatocytes are mafure erythrocytes of normal size and color but with an oval
or stoma (mouth)-shaped area of cenfral pallor.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Stomatocytes most commonly occur as artifacts, especially in the thick
areas of the smear. Stomafocytes occur in high numbers in the peripheral blood of Alaskan Malamutes
with hereditary stomatocytosis. This condition is characterized by short-limb dwarfism, chondrodyspla-

Erythrocytic Ghosts (lysed Red Blood Cells, Fading Erythrocytes)
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Erythrocytic ghosts are pale RBC membranes with no or mirimal hemoglobin.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: With intravascular hemolysis, the hemoglobin is dispersed, and the eryth-
rocyte membrane is rapidly cleared. Therefore, the presence of erythrocytic ghosts on peripheral blood
 smears suggests either very recent intravascular hemolysis or in vitro hemolysis. RBC lysis that occurs
during smear preparation usually appears as RBC smudges. With lipemia, erythrocytes have increased
membrane permeability and fragility, resulting in occasional smudged erythrocytes and erythrocytic
fuizzy, ill-defined cell borders.
NEXI sTEPs: When ghost RBCs are present, evaluate the smear for concurrent RBC agglutinafion and
spherocytosis to lend support to the diagnosis of infravascular hemolysis. Check the specimen for
lipemia, and rule out in vifro hemolysis by reviewing blood collection and handling techniques.

RED BLOOD CELLS
Nucleafed Red Blood Cells (Mefarubricyfes and Rubricyfes)
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Metarubricytes and rubricytes are nRBCs that are most commonly seen in
peripheral blood smears. These cells have small, round, central nuclei with coarse chromafin (rubricyte)
or smooth pyknofic chromatin (metarubricyte), and either polychromatophilic (blue-gray) or orthochro-
mic (orange-red) cytoplasm, which help in differenfiating them from small lymphocytes. Addifionally
nuclei in nRBCs are central in location, and a rim of cytoplasm may be traced around the entire nucleus.
In confrast, it is difficult to frace a complete rim of cyfoplasm around fthe nucleus of mafure lymphocytes
because of the eccentric placement of the nucleus.
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Nucleated RBCs (usually of the metarubricyte Or rubricyte stages) are
Z>) seo pue ssop leu og sreas poona enandad u siaqumu eus u pumn Aeuois
nRBCs/100 WBCs). Nucleated RBCs are quantitated during the WBC differential count, and reported as
fhe number of nRBCs per 100 WBCs. Increased numbers of nRBCs may occur with both regenerafive
(expected) and nonregenerative anemias (abnormal, suggesting an asynchronous regenerative response).
The most common cause of increased nRBCs is with regenerative anemia (hemorrhage or hemolysis).
It is important to note that the presence of nRBCs alone should not be taken as an indication of bone
marrow response fo an anemia, as increased rRBCs may be seen in norregenerafive anemias. Evaluation
of the regenerative response to an anemia should always be based on the degree of reticulocytosis
 Nucleated erythrocytes may be present in low rnumbers in peripheral blood smears secondary to
conditions such as spleric confraction; splenic disease or dysfuncfion or splenectomy (decreased nRBC
removal from the circulation); frauma (bone fracfures resulting in immafure cells of the marrow entering
the circulafion); hyperadrenocorficism (Cushing's disease); steroid admiristrafion (increased RBC sur-
vival time in the circulation); and cardiovascular disease (secondary to hypoxia). They may be seen in
certain canine breeds (miniafure Schnauzers and toy and miriafure Poodles) and in some inflarmmatory
conditions.
Nucleated erythrocytes may be present in low, moderate, or high numbers with many disease states
such as regenerative anemias, lead poisoning, bone marrow diseases, hemangiosarcoma, sepficemia, and
endotoxic shock. Bone marrow neoplasia (primary leukemia or metastafic neoplasia), inflammatory
diseases, lead poisoning, and heat sfroke may damage the bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial lining
into the circulation.
More immature stages of nRBCs (back to the rubriblast stage) may be found with some myeloprolif-
erafive diseases such as erythroleukemia and somefimes in markedly regenerative anemias, fhe lafter
somefimes observed in cats with Mycoplasrma hemofelis infection.
NEXI sIEPs: The significance of finding nRBCs on blood smear review is based on the numbers of
nRBCs, ruling out breed differences, and determining if anemia is present. As the differential WBC
count is performed, rRBCs are recorded as "rRBCs/100 WBC." If greater fhan 5 rRBCs/100 WBC
are present, most laboratories correct the WBC count for the presence of rRBCs. Some laboratories
report the total nucleated cell count, which includes leukocytes and nRBCs. Nucleated RBCs are nof
included in the differential WBC count, and an absolute number is given.

color as RBC nuclei), spherical structures wifhin the RBC cytoplasm.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: H-J bodies are fragments of RBC nuclei retained affer expulsion of the
nucleus (nuclear remnants). One should be careful not to confuse H-J bodies with an erythroparasite.
 Low numbers of H-J bodies may be present in the peripheral blood of normal cats and are infrequently
observed in fhe peripheral blood of normal dogs. The number of erythrocytes containing H-J bodies
tends to increase during regenerative anemias (similar to the increase in nRBCs) as well as other condi-
tions (similar disorders and mechanisms seen with increased nRBCs) such as splenic disease, postsple-
nectomy state, bone marrow disease (myelophthesis), chemotherapy, radiation, erythroid toxins, and
glucocorticoid therapy.
NEXT STEPs: The number of H-J bodies and association wifh anemia or norrmovolemia determine the
significance of H-J bodies found on blood smear review.

and cats and commonly with lead poisoning. Make sure to distinguish basophilic stippling from siderotic

whereas siderotic inchusions tend to aggregate loosely.
 NEXT SIEPs: If basophilic stippling and moderate numbers of nRBCs are present in a nonanemic
pafient or in one wifh a mild anemia, blood lead levels should be determined to rule out lead toxicosis.
Mild anemia may occur wifth chronic lead exposure. Assess for neurologic signs, gastrointestinal clini-
cal signs, or both, which occur secondary to lead poisoning. If basophilic stippling (primarily within

Siderotic Inclusions (Pappenheimer Bodies)
DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Siderotic inclusions are aggregated basophilic structures generally eccentrically
 placed on one side near the periphery of the RBC.
DIAGNOsTIC $IGNIFICANCE: These are iron-containing inclusions that are Occasionally seen in disorders
such as lead poisoning, hemolytic anemia, dyserythropoiesis, and myeloproliferative disorders. Poly-
chromatophilic RBCs and mature RBCs containing these inclusions are called siderocytes.
NEXI sTEPs: Distinguish siderotic inclusions from basophilic stippling (see section on basophilic stip-
pling). If evidence of lead poisoning is present (mild to no anemia, basophilic stippling, and increased
numbers of nRBCs), blood lead levels should be determined. If signs of dyserythropoiesis or myelo
proliferafive disease are evident on blood film evaluafion, exarminafion of a bone marrow sample may
be indicated. While seldom done, a Prussian blue stain can be used to confirm the presence of Pap-
 penheimer bodies (siderotic inclusions will stain blue).

Heinz Bodies
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Heinz bodies appear as singular, round projections from the RBC membrane.
They may be quite small or very large and prominent. In some cases, a single RBC may have several
small Heinz bodies. Heinz bodies stain the same red-pink color of mafure RBCs with routine Wright
stains, and stain pale basophilic wifh Diff-Quik stain. With Diff-Quik stain, Heinz bodies may be seen
both as round projections from the RBC membrane and as clear round inclusions that have not yet pro-
jected out from fhe RBC membrane. If the presence of Heinz bodies is in question, or to get a more
accurate determinafion of the number of Heinz bodies present, a blood smear may be stained with NMB.
With NMB, Heinz bodies stain blue-black, whereas the RBC is pale aqua. In wet mount preparations
with NMB, Heinz bodies appear as refractile inclusions when out of focus and are sometimes referred
to as erythrocyterefractilebodies(ERbodies).
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Heinz bodies occur from oxidative injury resulting in denafured (oxi-
dized), precipitated hemoglobin that tends to adhere to the inner surface of RBC membranes. Heinz
bodies are seen most frequenfly in peripheral blood smears from cats (up to 5% of RBC in normal cats
have small Heinz bodies). Feline RBCs are more susceptible to Heinz body formation, and the feline
spleen is nonsinusoidal and less efficient at removing Heinz bodies.
thyroidism, and lymphoma. Heinz bodies are always abnormal in dogs. Some causes of Heinz body
hemolytic anemia secondary to oxidant ingestion include orions, garlic, acetaminophen, methylene blue,
methiorine, phenazopyridine, zinc (perries minted affer 1982), naphthalene (chemical in mothballs),
 propylene glycol (in some moist foods), and vitamin Ks (menadione).
NEXI sTEPs: If moderate to high numbers of Heinz bodies are present in feline blood smears or any
Heinz bodies are detected in canine blood, first rule out oxidant ingestion. In cats, rule out underlying
metabolic disease (diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism) and lymphoma. Both enumerafion of
Heinz bodies and assessment of the size of the Heinz bodies are useful in determining the extent of
oxidative injury. Also, carefuilly check RBC morphology for the presence of eccenfrocytes, pyknocytes,
and ghost RBCs, which may also be seen with oxidative RBC damage.

tic syndromes are associated with cytoperia(s) and ineffective hematopoiesis with evidence of cellular
dysplasia in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Offen, an asynchronous regenerafive response to the
anemia exists, as polychromatophilic RBCs or reficulocytes are infrequent to absent, yet increased nRBCs
are present. Some MDSs have evidence of dysplasia in the myeloid and platelet cell lines as well.
cant, markedly regenerative anemia exists, then, this is likely secondary to accelerated hematopoiesis.
Note that dysplasia may occur secondary to some disease states, toxins, and drugs. If erythropoiesis
is ineffective and many significant dysplastic changes have occurred, bone marrow cytology is advised
to corfirm MDS. In cats, FeLV testing should be performed as well.

Erythrocytic Parasites
Mycoplasma hemocanis (previously Hemobartonella canis)
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Mycoplasma hemocanis (Hermobartonella canis) organisms are gram-positive para-
 sites of dogs found on the surface of the RBC and generally appear as blue-black, filamentous chains of
small rods or dots. When found on the blood smear, the orgarisms are often present in high numbers.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Infection with Mycoplasma hemocanis typically only causes significant
disease in dogs that have been splenectomized, have severe splenic disease, or are immunocompromised
and thus have moderate to severe hemolytic anemia. Oecasional spherocytes and positive Coombs test
 Suggest an immune-mediated component to the anemia.
NEXI sTEPs: If the pafient is known to be splenectomized, antibiofic treatment is warranted. If the
pafient is not splenecfomized, assessment for disease of the spleen or causes of immunosuppression
along with antibiofic treatment is recommended. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on the
blood may be used to confirm infection by identification of the presence of organism-specific nucleic
acid (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], ribonucleic acid [RNA]).

Mycoplasma hemofelis (previously Hemobartonella felis)
lular parasites of cats. The organisms form small dots or rods on the surface of the RBC. They stain
blue-black and tend to occur on the periphery of erythrocytes. Occasional chains of dots and ring forms
may be seer.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Infection with Mycoplasma hemofelis may be primary or secondary. Primary
 disease results in an acute, moderate to severe anemia with a marked regenerative response. As in dogs
with M. hemocanis infection, an immune-mediated component to the anemia may exist (autoagglutination
and positive Coombs test). Many cats are subclinically infected, and the parasitemia is only recognized
when the patient becomes immunocompromised by another disease process (i.e., neoplasia, FeLV infec-
tion) resulting in secondary disease. In these cases, the anemia is often nonregenerative or poorly regen-
erafive. Some of the most severe anemias occur wifh concurrent FeLV and Mycoplasma infection. Note
that not finding Mycoplasma organisms during a roufine slide evaluafion does not rule out the possibility
Of infection.
Mycoplasma organisms are present on the outside of the erythrocyte; therefore, blood smears should
 be made soon after blood collction, as the parasites may dislodge from the erythrocyte membrane. In
this case, the organisms may be found free in the extracellular space on blood films but are extremely
difficult to distinguish from stain precipitate. Thus, if confirmation of the parasite is sought from an
outside consultant, premade blood smears should be submifted along wifh arn EDTA fube of whole blood.
NEXI sTEPs: If Mycoplasma orgarisms are confirmed on blood smear review, antibiotic treatment is
warranted. If suspected, PCR testing for Mycoplasma species is recommended. Rule out concurrent
disease (i.e., neoplasia, FeLV, and FTV infection) and check the blood film for autoagglutination of
 RBC to rule ouft a concurrent immune-mediated component to the anemia.

Cytauxzoon felis
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Cytauxzoon felis is a protozoal hemoparasite of the cat and is readily identified
by its "signet ring" appearance. Lower numbers of "safety pin" and "Maltese cross" forms may be
in up to 25% of the erythrocytes. Rarely, large macrophages containing schizonts full of developing
merozoifes are observed on the feathered edge of the blood smear
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Cytauxzoonosis is a highly fatal disease of domestic cats. Norfatal forms
have been idenfified in some parts of the country. The severe clinical signs (depression, fever, anorexia,
icterus) are secondary to the fissue phase of infection (infection of the spleen, liver, lung, lymph nodes,
and bone marrow). The associated anemia is tsually nonregenerative, and concurrent thrombocytopenia
and leukopenia may exist.
NEXT sTEPs: Cytauxzoon felis orgarisms are differentiated from Mycoplasma hermofelis on peripheral
blood smears by finding signet ring-shaped organisms with generally a single organism per eryth-
rocyte, as opposed to finding multiple, dot- or rod-shaped organisms on the periphery of the RBC,
respectively.

Babesiaspp.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Babesia organisms are intraerythrocytic protozoal parasites. In dogs, two forms
d paed ro renns se radde jen ssr sre are su visaaa () azs Aq pasmus ae
canis, vogeli, and rossi) have been identified. The different subspecies have variable virulence, with clinical
signs ranging from mild to severe. The second form of Babesia orgarisms are small and form single to
multiple signet rings within infected RBCs. To date, three main species of small Babesia have been identi-
fied: (1) B. gibsoni, (2) B. conradae, and (3) B. microti-like piroplasms (Theileira annae). With both large and
small Babesia, the orgarism's cytoplasm tends to stain clear to blue, whereas the nucleus stains red to
pu.rple.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Babesia organisms are intracellular and cause hemolytic anemia with an
intravascular component, often with a concurrent thrombocytoperia. Spherocytes and a positive Coombs
test may indicate an immune-mediated component. Primary babesiosis generally results in a strongly
regenerative anemia. In some animals, the infection is subclinical until the animal becomes immunosup-
pressed with another disease. In the later circumstance, the anemia may be nonregenerative. Clinical
signs of babesiosis range from subclirnical to mild to severe. Acute disease is offen associated with signs
 of depression, fever, weakness, lymph node enlargement, splenic enlargement, and anemia.
NEXI sTEPs: The presence of intraerythrocytic Babesia orgarisms on blood smear review is diagnostic
for carine babesiosis. The absence of orgarisms does not rule out infection that may be subclirical.
 The two general categories of Babesia, the large and small forms, may be identified microscopically.
However, further categorizaftion of species and subspecies may only be performed by using molecular
techriques (PCR and DNA sequencing).
When Babesia organisms are identified, review the blood film carefully for evidence of concurrent
 IMHA (RBC agglutination and spherocytes), and assess for thrombocytopenia as well.

Leukocytosis
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Leukocytosis is defined as the presence of increased leukocyte rumbers,
which may be cauised by ar increase in the number of one cell type or a combination of cell types. The
significance of a leukocytosis is based on the degree of elevation, the cell types constifuting the increase,
and the cellular morphology (normal, dysplastic, toxic, neoplastic). Increased numbers of neutrophils
secondary to inflammation is the most common cause of a leukocytosis.

Leukopenia
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Leukoperia is defined as a decrease in leukocyte nurmbers, which is most
offen caused by a decrease in the number of neutrophils (neutroperia), as neutrophils are the most
numerous of the peripheral blood leukocytes. Careful exam of the enfire blood smear is emphasized by
the fact that sometimes during blood smear preparafion, the leukocytes can be concenfrated on the
feathered edge. In this case, the monolayer will contain very few leukocytes, suggesting an artifacfual
leukoperia if the monolayer only, and not the entire slide, is examined for WBC estimafion.

WHITE BLOOD CELLS
Neutrophils
Neutrophils are the most abundant of the granulocytic cell types. Mafurafion stages from least mature
to most mafure are: myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band neutrophils, and
mafure (segmented) neufrophils. As cells mafure, they decrease in size, the cytoplasm becomes less blue
and evenfually becomes clear to lightly colored, and the nucleus becomes more condensed and evenfu-
ally lobulated.
Neufrophils are released from bone marrow into circulafion in an age-related fashion, with fhe most
      s      (   
phils, so immafure forms are not released into the circulation until the demand (severe, acufte infection
and inflammation) for neufrophils exceeds the storage pool's ability to supply adequate numbers of
mature cells. Increased numbers of immafure neutrophils in the peripheral blood is referred to as a "left 
shift" and is the hallmark of acute inflammafion. Immafure neufrophils are also released in an age-related
fashion, and as such, the immafure neutrophil stage primarily seen in peripheral blood during a left shiff
is the band neufrophil, with less mafure stages seer orly rarely. In general, the more severe the systemic
inflammafion, the higher the rumber of neutrophils wifh increased numbers of immafure forms present.
The morphology and diagnostic significance of the various neutrophil mafurafional stages and the
abnormalifies that occur in the neufrophil series are discussed below.
Mature (Segmented) Neutrophils
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Mafure neutrophils of dogs and cats have similar morphologies. Neutrophils are
abundant, and may contain a few very indistinct, faint pink granules, and/or small clear vacuoles, or
both. The nucleus is highly condensed and lobulated, generally containing three or four lobules. Nuclear
lobes may be connected by a thin strand of chromatin, but more commonly, simply a narrowing of the
chromatin exists between lobes to about one third the diameter of the fhick porfion of the lobules.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Mature neufrophil numbers are increased (neutrophilia) in conditions such
steroid administrafion, inflammafion (infecfious and noninfectious causes), fissue necrosis, and neopla-
sia. Mafure neufrophilia caused by inflammafion is often associated with an increase in band neutrophils
(left shiff). Leukermoid response is a term used to describe a marked neufrophilia, offen with a leff shiff,
which may be seen with severe, acute, focal inflammation (i.e., pyometra, peritonitis, pyothorax, severe
abscessafion). A persistently increasing, moderate to marked neufrophilia, in which a source of inflam-
mafion, infection, tissue destruction, or necrosis cannot be found, should raise the suspicion for chronic
granulocyticleukemia.
Mafure neutrophil numbers are decreased (neutroperia) by conditions such as overwhelming bacte
rial infections, viral infections (parvovirus, panleukopenia, feline leukemia virus [FeLV]), certain bacte-
rial infections (Salmonella), rickettsial infections (i.e., chronic ehrlichiosis), endotoxemia (infection with
 gram-negative bacteria), chemotherapeutic agents, bone marrow necrosis, myelophthesic diseases (bone
marrow infiltration wifth neoplastic cells), and bone marrow suppression or failure (i.e., drug-induced
neutropenia, immune-mediated neufroperia, cyclic hematopoiesis).

Band Neutrophils
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Band neutrophils are similar in size and appearance to mafure neufrophils except
that the nuclei are nonsegmented (band shaped) or only slighfly constricted, and nuclear chromatin is
not as fighfly clumped. The classic band neufrophil has a plump C-shaped or S-shaped nucleus, wifh
parallel sides, a smooth nuclear margin, and a fairly constant width. If slight constricted areas are present,
they are more than one third the width of the rest of the nucleus, distinguishing the bands from mafure
neufrophils, which have constricted areas of less fhan one third the width of other areas of the nucleus.
The nuclear chromatin is less dense than that of a mafure neutrophil. The cytoplasm remains clear unless
toxic change is present.

healthy dogs and cats. A left shift is the hallmark of acute inflammafion. Systemic inflammatory media
tors travel to bone marrow, resulting in the production and release of neutrophils. Despite this systemic
response, the inflammation may be focal (ie., pyometra) or diffuse (ie., bacterial sepsis). Additionally,
not all focal areas of inflammafion induce a systemic response. For example, cystifis (inflammafion of
the bladder) is not generally associated with an increased number of band neutrophils. Chronic granu-
locytic leukemia may also cause an increase in band neutrophil rumbers. Also, pseudo-band neutrophils
(hyposegmented mafure neufrophils) may be seen in Pelger-Huet anomaly (discussed later).

in other peripheral blood leukocytes (i.e., eosinophils) but is most easily recognized in neutrophils

important in distinguishing inherited or acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly from a true left shift. Correlation
of the findings with the health stafus of the patient is very important. If the patient is sick, confinued
assessment of the blood film over time may be necessary to rule out Pelger-Huet anomaly.

Toxic Changes
Systemic inflammation, most notably secondary to bacterial infections, may cause microscopic foxic
changes in neutrophils. The most common toxic changes are cytoplasmic and include Dohle bodies, toxic
granulation, diffuse cytoplasmic basophilia, and cytoplasmic vacuolation. Toxic neutrophils may contain
only one or two of these changes, or all may be evident in severely toxic cells. During rapid neutrophil
production (neutropoiesis) in bone marrow in response to systemic inflammatory mediators, neutrophils
undergo specific mafuration defects, which results in toxic changes. As wifth a left shift, the presence of
toxic neutrophils indicates systemic inflammation. Less common toxic changes involve the nucleus (i.e.,
ring forms) or affect cell size (i.e., giant neutrophils) and are rarely seen except with severe inflammation,
offen with a significant left shiff.
Like band neutrophils and other immafure neutrophil forms, toxic neutrophils are not recognized by
automated hematology analyzers and must be identified on blood film review. The different toxic
changes discussed below are generally graded as slight, mild, moderate, or marked; or on a 1 to 4+ scale.
the higher is the grade.
Dohle Bodies
 DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Dohle bodies are variably sized, variably shaped, light blue to slate gray struc-
fures in the cytoplasm of neutrophils. These foci are clumps of endoplasmic reticulum that are usually
 degraded during maturation, yet retained during accelerated neutropoiesis.
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Dohle bodies are the most easily produced and, therefore, the most
ing Dohle bodies, when occurring alone without other toxic changes, Dohle bodies should never be
interpreted as meaning anything more than a mild toxic change in dogs. Dohle bodies may occur in 
clinically healthy cats and, thus, are often not reported as a toxic change in cats unless these bodies are
numerous or present with other toxic changes. Make sure not to confuse Dohle with Ehrlichia morulae
 s
NEXI sTEPs: When Dohle bodies are evident in the dog or seen in high numbers in cats, assess for
other toxic changes and for the presence of immature neutrophils (left shift). Be careful to not confuse
 Dohle bodies with Ehrlichia morulae, distemper inclusions, or parasites.

Diffuse Cytoplasmic Basophilid
DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: With diffuise cytoplasmic basophilia, the neutrophil cytoplasm stains basophilic
 (blue). Diffuse basophilia occurs when ribosomes remain scaftered throughout the cytoplasm (as opposed
to being clumped into Dohle bodies), instead of being degraded during mafurafion. Diffuse cytoplasmic
basophilia is graded as a mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the number of neutrophils affected
 and the severity of the basophilia.
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of diffuse cytoplasmic basophilia indicates systemic inflam-
mafion, regardless of whether a neutrophilia or a left shift exists (although it usually is associated with
both).

Cytoplasmic Vacuolization (Foamy Cytoplasm)
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Neutrophils containing foamy appearing vacuoles within their cytoplasm are
considered toxic. Toxic vacuolization generally is recognized in association with diffuse cytoplasmic
basophilia, as the basophilic background enhances the ability to discern the vacuoles. Toxic vacuolizafion
ofvacuolization.
Cytoplasmic vacuolizafion should not be corfused with the discrete clear vacuoles that develop in
neutrophils exposed to EDTA for several hours. The rate of EDTA-induced cytoplasmic vacuolizafion is
variable, depending on temperafure and other factors, but may occur rather rapidly. Therefore, if cyto-
plasmic vacuolization is present without other evidence of inflammation (i.e., other toxic changes, left 
shift), the possibility of artifacfual cytoplasmic vacuolizafion should be considered.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Toxic vacuolization Occurs secondary to systemic inflammation Or
artifactuially.
NEXI sTEPs: Determine how quickly blood smears were made from the EDTA blood tube. Prolonged

Toxic Granulation
 granules are toxic. These are retained primary granules, which are not normally present in later stages
 Of neutrophil development (usually seen up to the progranulocyte stage). Depending on the number of 
neutrophils affected, toxic granulation is interpreted as a mild, moderate, or severe.
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE Toxic granulation indicates systemic inflammafion.
 NEXT sTEPs: If neutrophilic granulation is observed without evidence of other toxic changes, a left

Ring (Doughnut) Form
DISTINcTIvE FEATUREs: Immafure neufrophils containing a round nucleus with a hole in the center
(doughnut-shaped nucleus) wifhout significant indentafions in the nucleus are a rarely observed toxic
change involving the nucleus.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Ring-form neutrophils are seen occasionally in cats and infrequenfly in
dogs with severe systemic inflammafion or toxemia. This finding is considered a toxic change, and the
neufrophils are best classified as band neutrophils.

Giant Neutrophils
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Giant (larger than normal) neutrophils and bands are considered a toxic change
that affects cell size.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Skipped cell divisions during accelerated neufrophil production and mat-
urafion process may lead to the formafion of large neufrophils and bands in the peripheral blood. This
is generally associated wifth other toxic changes.
NEXT sTEPs: Giant neutrophils and bands are usually associated with other toxic changes. If other
evidence of toxicity is not present, then other causes of giant neutrophils, for example, poodle mac-
rocytosis (poodle marrow dyscrasia syndrome), FeLV myelodysplasia in cats, and administrafion of
certain chemotherapeutics, should be investigated.

WHITE BLOOD CELLS
Lymphocytes
Lymphocytes vary in size in the peripheral blood of dogs and cats. Small lymphocytes predominate wifh
less densely staining, but still clearly clumped, nuclear chromafin. Lymphocytes are typically the second
most common peripheral blood leukocyte (mafure neutrophil being the most common).
Small Lymphocytes
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Small lymphocytes are mafure cells, approximately 10 μm in diameter with
densely staining (dark purple), round to oval nuclei, which are sometimes slighfly indented and usually
(euchromatin). Occasionally, small lymphocytes may have nuclear chromatin, which appears smudged,
especially wifth quick stains. The nucleus is eccenfric, and a scant amount of moderately blue cyfoplasm
exists. Because of the eccenfric placement of the nucleus, it is difficult to completely frace the rim of
cytoplasm around the nucleus.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Small lymphocytes are fhe most abundant form of lymphocyte in canine
and feline blood. Increased numbers (lymphocytosis) may occur with epinephrine release secondary to
excitement (mild lymphocytosis is common in young dogs and cats); chronic immune stimulation, and
lymphoid neoplasia (chroric lymphocytic leukemia). Decreased numbers (lymphoperia) of lymphocytes
may occur wifh acute inflammafion or, commonly, as a "stress" leukogram secondary to glucocorticoid
release.
NEXT sTEPs: Be careful to not corfuse small lymphocytes with nucleated red blood cells such as
rubricytes and metarubricytes. A rim of cytoplasm may usually be traced enfirely around the nucleus
Of nucleated RBCs but not in mafure lymphocytes.
Distinguishing a lymphocytosis secondary fo immunostimulation from chroric lymphocytic leukemia
may be difficult. Careful assessment for underlying infectious disease (especially ehrlichiosis in dogs),
correlation of the age of the patient and clinical signs (chronic lymphocytic leukemia is uncommon in
young arimals), serial moritoring of lymphocyte absolute rumbers and morphology, and, in some cases,
the use of adjunct diagnostics (immunostains and flow cytometry) should be employed.

WHITE BLOOD CELLS
Reactive Lymphocytes
DISTINcTIvE FEATUREs: The primary feafures fhat identify a reactive lymphocyte are cytoplasmic
changes. In general, reacfive lymphocytes are larger because of a mild to moderate increase in the amounf
mafure lymphocytes. Additionaly, the nuclear chromatin is less condensed. The deep cytoplasmic baso-
philia of reactive lymphocytes represents an abundance of polyribosomes associated with increased
 protein synthesis and usually contrasts with the pale, perinuclear Golgi region.
 DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Reactive lymphocytes are immune-stimulated lymphocytes with upregul-
lated synthesis of inflammatory mediators, and /or immunoglobulins (antibodies), or both. Reactive
 lymphocytes in peripheral blood suggest active, systemic antigenic stimulation secondary to both infec-
fious and noninfectious disorders.
NEXI sTEPs: It is imporfant to differenfiate reactive lymphocytes from neoplastic lymphocytes. In
general, reactive lymphocytes occurring secondary to systemic immune stimulation, are present
together with a wide range of lymphocyte morphology (small, mature lymphocytes; reactive lympho-
cytes; plasmacytoid lymphocytes; intermediate-sized lymphocytes; and occasionally also granular
lymphocytes). Neoplastic lymphocytes, as discussed in Section V: Hematopoietic Neoplasia, may be
small, intermediate sized, and blastic. If in high rumbers, neoplastic lymphocytes are morphologically
similar, forming a uriform population. Further testing such as immunostaining and flow cytometry
 may be needed to identify a neoplastic population of lymphocytes.

Plasmacytoid Reactive Lymphocytes
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: With strong, chroric inflammation, reactive lymphocytes may become plasma-
cytoid (plasma cells in peripheral blood). Plasma cells are well differentiated B lymphocytes. They are
larger than small lymphocytes and have an eccenfrically placed round nucleus, with condensed nuclear
chromatin and deeply basophilic cytoplasm because of the abundant polyribosomes associated with
increased protein synthesis. Also, a perinuclear clear zone (Golgi region) is generally visible.
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Plasmacytoid reactive lymphocytes indicate strong, chronic, systemic
inflammation but are etiologically nonspecific.
            s
tious or inflammatory disease, rule out recent vaccinafion, and, if associated with hyperglobulinemia,
consider serum electrophoresis to characterize the immunoglobulin paftern, which aids in categoriz-
ing the inflammatory response and may also be used to check for lymphoid malignancy (lymphoid
leukemia, plasma cell neoplasia, lymphoma).

of cytoplasm, which ranges from light to moderately basophilic and contains few, variably sized, eosino-
philic intracytoplasmic granules that may be dispersed throughout the cytoplasm or concentrated in a
perinuclear region of the cytoplasm.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Large granular lymphocytes may be present in low numbers in the periph-
eral blood of clirically normal dogs and cats. Increased numbers may occur wifth chronic immune stimu-
lafion (especially chroric ehrlichiosis in dogs). When moderate to high numbers of granular lymphocytes
are present in peripheral blood and infectious disease has been ruled out, granular lymphocyfic leukemia
 or circulating neoplastic cells from lymphoma of granular lymphocyte origin should be investigated.

Monocytes
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Canine and feline monocytes are larger than neutrophils and similar in size or
slightly larger than eosinophils and basophils. Their ruclei vary greatly in morphology, ranging from
elongated U-shapes that resemble band neutrophils to irregular multilobulated forms. The nuclear chro-
minute eosinophilic granules, and occasionally lighfly vacuolated. Cytoplasmic borders are usually
 irregular, sometimes with fine, filamentous, pseudopodia-like extensions. Because of their relatively large
size, monocytes may be concentrated along fhe feathered edge, and their proporfion underestimated in
blood smear differential white blood cell (WBC) counts.
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: A few monocytes are present in the peripheral blood of healthy dogs and
cats. Increased numbers of monocytes (monocytosis) may occur with disorders suuch as subacute and
chronic inflammation, excess endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids (common in the dog but incon-
sistent in the caf), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (parf of a leukemoid response to accelerated hemato-
poiesis), FIV infection (cat), and neoplasia of the monocytic cell line (rare). Decreased numbers of
monocytes (monocytopenia) is not diagnostically significant because of the normally low numbers of
monocytes in healthy dogs and cats.
 In condifions such as severe bacterial infections or septicemia, some of the circulating monocytes may
have transformed into macrophages. Macrophages are offen highly vacuolated with an increased amount
of lightly basophilic cytoplasm and convoluted nuclei. Somefimes, fhese cells are referred to as reactive
or toxic monocytes and yet are very rarely identified in peripheral blood.

WHITE BLOOD CELLS
Eosinophils
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Eosinophils are slightly larger than neutrophils, wifh nuclei that are less lobu-
lated, often divided into only two distinct lobules, and with less condersed chromatin than those of
mafure neufrophils. The cytoplasm of eosinophils is clear to faintly basophilic and contains large numbers
 s            
eosinophil granules are round and vary widely in number and size. Carine eosinophils occasionally
contain a single, large granule that may be mistaken for an inclusion body or organism. Eosinophils of
Greyhounds (and few other Sight Hound breeds) are peculiar because they may degranulate during
 staining and appear vacuolated on smears (the so-called gray eosinophils of Greyhounds).
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Eosinophils may usually be found in low numbers in the blood smears of
healthy dogs and cats. Increased numbers of eosinophils (eosinophilia) may occur with many hypersen-
sitivify diseases of allergic or parasific origin, both of which could involve the skin (ectoparasites, flea
bite dermatitis), lungs (hearfworm infection, lungworm infection, feline asthma), and gastrointestinal
tract (inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal parasites). Rarely, a paraneoplastic eosinophilia secondary
to the presence of a solid fumor (especially mast cell neoplasia) may be seen. A moderate to marked
eosinophilia, which is unexplained, may be seen with eosinophilic leukemia (rare). Excess glucocorfi-
coids, either endogenous or exogenous, may cause a decrease in circulating eosinophils (eosinopenia).
Otherwise, due to low numbers of eosinophils normally in the dog and cat, an eosinopenia is not diag-
nostically sigrificant.
 NEXT STEPs: If an eosinophilia is detected, further assessment for underlying allergic, parasiftic, or
neoplastic disease is warranted. Check the blood film carefully for any circulating mast cells and for
hemoparasites (microfilaria).

WHITE BLOOD CELLS
Basophils
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Basophils are the largest and least numerous of the mafure granulocytic cell
types and are often not seen on a standard 100-cell differential cell count in healthy dogs and cats. Baso-
phil nuclei are less densely staining, have fewer lobulafions, and have a more elongated, ribborlike
appearance compared with the nuclei of neutrophils. The basophil cytoplasm is pale to moderately blue-
gray to purple and typically contains granules. Occasionally, no granules may be visible. Granule size
phils contain abundant oval, pale lavender to gray granules, although immature basophils may also
contain a few primary, dark purple granules.
DIAGNosTIC SIGNIFIcANCE: Basophils are rare in the peripheral blood of healthy dogs and cats.
Increased numbers of basophils (basophilia) are often associated wifh a concurrent eosinophilia, and
similar etiologies of hypersensifivity disease as for increased eosinophils apply for a basophilia. A mod-
erate to marked unexplained basophilia may occur secondary to basophilic leukemia (exfremely rare).
Decreased numbers of basophils (basopenia) are not diagnostically significant because of the low numbers
of basophils in the peripheral blood of healthy dogs and cats.
NEXI sTEPs: Be careful to not confuse mast cells with basophils. Mast cells are larger than basophils
and often will be found concentrated on fhe feathered edge of the smear. Mast cells usually contain
large numbers of granules compared with basophils, and mast cell ruclei are round to ovoid, whereas
 basophil nuclei are ribbonlike.

WHITE BLOOD CELLS
Mast Cells
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Mast cells are large mononuclear cells that have a moderate to abundant amount
of pale blue cytoplasm. The nucleus is round to oval, and the cytoplasm contains many small, round,
intensely staining, intracytoplasmic metachromatic (reddish-purple) granules. Granule numbers range 
from few to many, but typically high numbers of granules are present and may be so abundant as to fill 
the cytoplasm, obscuring the nucleus. Poorly differentiated mast cells may have low numbers of intra-
cytoplasmicgranules.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Rarely, a mast cell may be seen on the peripheral blood smear of a healthy
dog or cat. Mast cells have been observed in fhe peripheral blood of dogs and cats with mast cell neo
 plasia and in very low numbers on blood smears from dogs with severe inflammatory conditions. Large 
numbers of mast cells may be seen wifth mast cell leukemia (very uncommon).
NEXI sTEPs: Be careful to nof corfuse mast cells wifh basophils. Mast cells are larger than basophils
and often will be found concentrated on the feathered edge of the smear Mast cells usually contain
large numbers of granules compared with basophils, and mast cell nuclei are round to ovoid, whereas
basophil nuclei are ribbonlike.
 Finding circulating mast cells on peripheral blood smears from dogs and especially cats warrants a
thorough search for underlying mast cell neoplasia of the skin, liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract.

Sideroleukocytes
DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Sideroleukocytes are neutrophils or monocytes containing intracytoplasmic,
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Sideroleukocytes are rarely observed on peripheral blood smears with
disorders such as immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) and following blood transfisions.
Hemosiderin is an iron-containing pigment, and sideroleukocytes may be confirmed by staining a blood 
film with an iron stain suich as Prussian blue (rarely done).
NEXT sTEPs: If sideroleukocytes are identified and a blood fransfusion has not been performed, top
consideration is IMHA and warrants close review of the blood film for ghost RBCs, spherocytes, RBC
agglutinafion, and hemoparasites.

WHITE BLOOD CELLS
Macrophage
in the peripheral blood of healthy dogs and cats. Macrophages are large mononuclear cells with abundant
clear cytoplasm and round nuclei with coarse chromafin and are offen vacuolated and sometimes cyto-
 phagic. They may be uniform but, in some neoplastic conditions, may have criteria of malignancy (large
cell and nuclear size, multiple nuclei, prominent nucleoli).
DIAGNosTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Monocytes are the peripheral blood precursors to tissue macrophages.
Monocytes leave peripheral blood secondary to inflammatory mediators and develop into tissue
agents (especially fungal organisms), and debris. If macrophages are found in peripheral blood smears,
they are usually on the feathered edge because of their large size.
NEXI sTEPs: Macrophages are rarely found in the peripheral blood of healthy animals; however, when
 collecting blood from a patient, if a regional source of inflammation or infection is present, concurrent 
sampling of subcutaneous tissue may occasionally result in low numbers of fissue macrophages in
blood. If macrophages demonstrate criteria of malignancy, then histiocytic neoplasia should be
strongly suspected and would warrant assessment for histiocyfic neoplasia of the lymph nodes, liver,
spleen, lungs, and bone marrow.

DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Distemper inclusions are aggregates of viral nucleocapsids that appear as round
to oval to irregular, red to blue, cytoplasmic strucfures. The inclusions tend to occur in either the mono
most easily idenfified on Diff-Quik-stained smears as bright, homogeneous, eosinophilic, round to ovoid
cytoplasmic strucfures. Distemper inclusions may be seen on Wright-stained smears; however, they tend
to stain pale blue and are somewhat more difficult to identify.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Distemper inclusions are seen orly rarely on peripheral blood smears from
ated with clinical signs of upper respiratory disease. The lack of identifiable inclusions does not rule out
distemper infection, and if suspected clinically, warrants further testing. Make sure to distinguish Dis-
temper inclusions from other inclusions and artifacts such as Dohle bodies, Ehrlichia morulae and
platelets overlying WBCs.

Ehrlichia/ Anaplasma spp.
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Ehrlichiosis is a group of tickborne diseases cauised by a gram-negative infracel-
lular bacterium that infects blood cells. The disease is categorized by the host and the type of blood cell
a morula. Morulae are large, round to oval clusters composed of small dotlike orgarisms, which stain as 
a stippled dark blue inclusion. One or more morulae may be present in a cell.
Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis is caused primarily by Ehrlichia canis and less commonly by Ehrlichia
chaffeensis. Morulae are found primarily within the cytoplasm of monocytes. The disease may be acute
or chronic. Clinical signs may be mild to severe and may include fever, lethargy, anorexia, enlarged
lymph nodes and spleen, bleeding disorders, vomiting or diarrhea, ocular changes, and neurologic signs.
CBC abnormalities may include one or all of the following: nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia,
andneutropenia.
Canine granulocyfic ehrlichiosis is caused by Ehrlichia ewingii and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (for-
merly Ehrlichia equi and Ehrlichia phagocytophilia). Morulae are found primarily in the cytoplasm of
neutrophils. Disease, clinical signs, and CBC changes are essentially the same as in canine monocytic
ehrlichiosis; however, suppurative polyarthritis is more commonly seen with granulocytic ehrlichiosis.
Rare cases of cats infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum have been documented.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Identification of morulae is diagnostic for ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis.
However, morulae are not seen in fhe vast majority of cases and may be present in low rumbers of cells.
If infection is suspected, further testing (serology, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) may be needed for 
diagnosis. Also, further testing for other tickborne disease is recommended to rule out co-infections.
 NEXT sTEPs: Be careful to not confuse artifacts (i.e., platelet overlying leukocyte) or other inclusions
(i.e., Dohle bodies) with morulae.

Hepatozoon spp.
DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Hepatozoon spp. are protozoan parasites of dogs, with infection resulting from
ingestion of infected ticks. The organism forms large (up to 11 μm) gametocytes, which are oval to ellipti-
cal, clear to pale blue strucfures wifhin the cytoplasm of neutrophils, monocytes, or both. The orgarism
typically displaces the nucleus to one side of the cell.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Hepatozoonosis is caused by Hepatozoon canis and Hepatozoon americanum
and is a severe disease that offer results in death. Clinical signs are related to severe cardiac and skeletal
muscle infection (myositis), with clirical signs that include fever, weight loss, muscle loss or wasting,
and skeletal pain. CBC findings are often remarkable, as hepatozoonosis is frequenfly associated wifh a
marked mafure neutrophilic leukocytosis with or without a leff shiff. Gametocytes of H. canis are seldom
found in peripheral blood leukocytes; however, gametocytes of H. armericanum are frequenfly present.
 NEXT STEPs: Identfificaftion of gametocytes in the cytoplasm of canine peripheral blood neutrophils
and monocytes is diagnostic for hepatozoonosis. Lack of identificafion of the parasite does not rule
out infection. If appropriate history of tick exposure, geographic location of the patient (most often 
seen in the Gulf Coast states of North America), appropriate clinical signs, and marked neutrophilia 
are present, further testing sulch as PCR should be performed.

neutrophils, and occasionally also lymphocytes, contain reddish to purple infracytoplasmic granules.
Basophils generally have larger granules, and in cats, basophil granules stain basophilic instead of the
typical mauve color. Affected individuals offen have significant physical abnormalifies such as dished

Chediak-Higashi Syndrome
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare inherited disease found in smoke
blue Persian cats, in which abnormal formation of lysosomal granules and abnormal degranulation
occurs. Affected cats typically have a diluted smoke blue coat color and yellow-green irises and may
have slight neutrophil function defects and bleeding disorders. With CHS, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic
grarules are found in neutrophils and less commonly in monocytes and lymphocytes. Leukocytes often
enlarged and eosinophil granules may appear roundish instead of having the typical rod shape. To
confirm if the granules are Dohle bodies or granules associated wifh CHS, a blood smear may be stained
using peroxidase staining, and CHS granules will stain black.
NEXI sTEPs: CHS is diagnosed on the basis of finding characteristic eosinophilic leukocyte granules
in smoke blue Persian cats and ruling out other granule abnormalities and toxic change of
neutrophils.

White Blood Cell Artifacts
Pyknotic Cells
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Pyknosis occurs in senescent (old) leukocytes and results from preprogrammed
cell death (apoptosis). With pyknosis, the nucleus becomes dense and compact and begins to fragment
(karyorrhexis) resulting in spheres of dark-staining nuclear chromatin. Therefore, pyknotic cells have an
intact cytoplasmic membrane with one or more, variably sized, dense, round, dark nuclear fragments.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of pyknotic cells generally indicates a delay (hours) in
making the blood smear affer blood collection. Although pyknotic cells are offen neufrophils because of
their short life span and because they are typically the most numerous leukocyte, the identity of pyknotic
cells cannot be determined. Preparafion of blood smears as soon as possible affer blood collecfion will
help avoid such arfifacts.

The free nucleus may retain a similar appearance to the intact cell nucleus, or the nuclear chromatin may
spread out and form an amorphous, netlike, eosinophilic strucfure (basket cell).
DlAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Free nuclei and basket cells represent ruptured nucleated cells, and a few
of the increased number of leukocytes and increased chances of rupfure. Also, condifions with high

DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Platelets are cytoplasmic fragments that form from bone marrow megakaryo-

oval strucfures, wifh few to many small reddish granules.

is imporfant in assessing fhe number of platelets as well as evaluafion of platelet size, shape, and granu-
larity. Canine and feline blood smears should have between 7 and 35 platelets on the average of ten 100x
oil objective fields in the monolayer to be considered adequate. Feline platelets tend to become activated
easily during collection, handling of the blood sample, or both; thus, feline platelets offen clump, result-
ing in falsely decreased platelet counts and estimates.

Feline platelets are small and offten similar in size to erythrocytes and may not be counted as platelets
recognized on evaluation of a blood film. Orly moderate and marked thrombocytopenias (platelet
counts below 100,000/μL) are recognized. This is not a problem, since increased bleeding secondary to
thrombocytopenia alone does not occur until platelet numbers are below 50,000/μL, and spontaneous
bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia alone does not occur until platelet numbers are below
25,000 /μL.
figation for the underlying pathologic mecharisms for thrombocytopenia should be performed.
decreased platelet production (certain drugs and toxins, immune-mediated destruction of platelets,
megakaryocytes, or both; neoplasia of the bone marrow); (2) decreased platelet survival (blood loss,
disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC], immune-mediated destruction); and (3) platelet
sequestration (secondary to enlarged spleen). If a cause cannot be established, bone marrow cytol-
ogy is offten very helpful in determining if disease of the marrow is the cause of persistent, unex-
plained thrombocytopenia).
bin time [PT], partial thromboplastin time [PTT]) are normal, then investigation into platelet function
defects should be considered wifh platelet function ftests. Diseases resulting in altered platelet function
may be both hereditary (Basset Hound thrombopathia, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, cyclic hematopoiesis
in Grey Collies, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia of Great Pyrenees and Ofterhounds), and acquired (drugs,
toxins, infections, neoplasia, hyperglobulinemia).

Thrombocytosis
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Greater than 35 platelets per oil power field (100x) objective on an average of 10
Or more fields.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Physiologic thrombocytosis (increased platelet production) is the most
common cause of fhrombocytosis, occurring secondary to a reacfive process (i.e., inflammafion, iron
 deficiency anemia in dogs, rebound from thrombocytopenia, chronic blood loss anemia), with platelet 
counts typically fewer than 1,000,000 platelets/μL (<60 platelets per oil power field [100x objective] on
 an average of 10 or more fields). If the platelet count is persistenfly greater than 1,o00,000 platelets/μL,
then essential thrombocythemia and acuite megakaryocytic leukemia should be considered, both of which
are very rare hemic neoplasms of dogs and cats.

PLATELETS
Platelet Clumps
platelet clumps may appear as blue blobs, which are difficult to recognize as platelet clumps. Because
of their large size, platelet clumps may be concenfrated on the feathered edge, but smaller clumps may
also be present in the monolayer.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Platelet clumping is typically an artifact secondary to platelet activation
during collection, handling of peripheral blood, or both. Platelet clumping is a common problem in cats.
Platelet clumps result in platelet counts (manual and machine generated) being falsely decreased, and
severe clumping may result in the platelet count being falsely reported as thrombocytoperia (pseudo
thrombocytopenia). Also, some condiftions cauuse platelets to be hyperactive, so they are more prone to
being activated, resulting in platelet clumps. If many platelet clumps are present in a patient that has a
present, the patient is considered to have sufficient numbers of platelets to not spontaneously bleed from

LYMPHOID LEUKEMIA
ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA 235
Overview
Leukermia is defined as a clonal proliferation of neoplastic cells originating in bone marrow. Leukemia of
every peripheral blood cell type has been identified in dogs and cats. Lymphoid leukemia (both acute
and chroric forms) is common in dogs and cats, whereas leukemias of the other cell lines are quite
uncommon. Diagnosis of leukemia is based on clinical presentation (clinrical signs and physical examina-
fion), and laboratory data, including complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry analysis. The
findings of large numbers of neoplastic cells on CBC and blood smear microscopic evaluafion are one
important part of the diagnosis and classification of the various leukemias. Definitive diagnosis may
offen require bone marrow evaluatior.
Many different leukemia classificafion schemes have been proposed and utilized. Various schemes
are based on a mix of informafion suich as clirnical behavior (response to therapy, survival fime), cellular
morphology (microscopic evaluafion of the neoplastic cells), histopathology (neoplastic paftern on fissue
biopsy), topography (extent of neoplastic involvement), phenotype (genetic expression), and genotype
(genetic characteristics and aberrations) of the neoplastic cell population.
mias, if is imporfant to recognize that morphology alone is not sufficient to classify various leukemias.
 This is especially true with the acute forms of leukemia, as blasts of various lineages may appear mor-
phologically identical.
Two large categories of leukemia exist: (1) lymphoid leukemias and (2) myeloid (nonlymphoid) leu-
kemias, with acute and chronic forms of each category. Acute leukemias are composed of blast cells. This
type of leukemia manifests acutely and is aggressive, often associated with large numbers of circulating
blasts, peripheral blood cytopenias, occasional secondary organ infiltration, and a poorer prognosis
compared with that for chronic leukemias.
With regard to acute leukemias, identification of the lineage of the blast cell population may be dif-
stains. Blast cells may somefimes have distinct feafures to suggest phenotype; however, most appear
fion may include cytochemical staining using enzymes and immunocytochemistry or flow cytomefry,
phenotyping). Furthermore, clonality tests are available for idenfifying lymphoid leukemias, to assess
whether a population of lymphoid cells are clonal in origin (suggestive of neoplasia) or nonclonal (sug-
gestive of inflammafion or reactivity). Idenfificafion of genetic abnormalifies (cytogenefics) is increas-
ingly playing a role in the classificafion of leukemias in veterinary medicine.
 In contrast to acute leukemias, chronic leukemias develop more slowly, are not offern associated with
cytoperias unfil the late stage of disease, offen do not have organ involvement, and are associated wifth
a more favorable prognosis. The neoplastic cell population in chronic leukemias comprises mafure, well-
differenfiated cells that are offen morphologically identical to normal blood leukocytes. Thus, the mafure
morphology of the neoplastic cells may make if very difficult to distinguish leukemia from irflammatory
processes. Differenfiafion is based on ruling out sources of infection, inflammafior, or immunostimula-
fion and continued monitoring of the CBC over time to document the persistence, and increasing
numbers, of one type of leukocyte
an emphasis on morphologic feafures.
Lymphoid Leukemia
Acufe Lymphoblasfic Leukemia
DISTINCTIvE FEATURES: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a reoplastic proliferation of lympho-
blasts and may be either B-cell or T-cell phenotype. Lymphoblasts are large cells, often 1.5 to 2 times the
diameter of neufrophils. Lymphoblasts confain slight to moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm, a
nucleoli may be present.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Lymphoblasts are rarely seen in the peripheral blood of normal dogs and
cats. Occasional lymphoblasts may be seen in peripheral blood with strong immune stimulafion. Low
to high numbers of lymphoblasts may be seen in peripheral blood with lymphoblastic leukermia. Classic

CBC findings with ALL include large numbers of circulating blasts and, offen, one or multiple
cytopenias.
       e      
can if reliably distinguish lymphoblasts from myeloblasts or monoblasts. Other methods suuch as
immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry are needed to define exact phenotype. B-cell leukemia is
associated with a more favorable prognosis compared with T-cell leukemia.
Low to occasional to moderate numbers of circulating lymphoblasts may be seen wifh stage V lym-
phoma, indicating neoplastic seeding of bone marrow and the subsequent leukemic phase. Distinguish-
the bulk of neoplastic involvement (marrow or blood versus solid tissue) may be used to distinguish the
conditions.
Finding low to high numbers of blasts in peripheral blood warrants assessment for involvement of
lymphoreticular organs for staging purposes.

DISTINCTIvE FEATURES: Chroric lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a neoplastic proliferafion of small

phocytosis in CLL may be mild in early stages and marked in later stages. Cytoperias are uncommon
 and typically only seen when the neoplastic cells are present in very high numbers.
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: CLL is most often a leukemia found in older dogs and cats. When a mild
to moderate lymphocytosis is present, distinguishing it from a reacfive population of lymphocytes sec-
 ondary to immunostimulation may be difficult and relies on monitoring of the CBC over time (persistent 
lymphocytosis, often with a slowly progressive increase in numbers). Immunophenotypic analysis and
tion, clonality testing is also available to help identify clonal populafions of lymphocytes. It is importanf
to recognize that clonality by itself is not diagnostic of neoplasia. As an example, clonal populations of
T lymphocytes have been identified in dogs with chronic ehrlichiosis.
NEXT STEPS: As for ALL, distinguishing between B-cell and T-cell phenotypes is not possible with
light microscopy alone, and further techriques are required. When CLL is diagnosed, assessment for
involvement of the lymphoreficular organs is advised to further stage fhe disease.
A diagnosis of CLL warrants moriforing of the CBC, despite treafment, as evolution into a blast crisis
may occur, culminating in an acute leukemia.

T-Cell Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia
 Of large, immature T lymphocytes, with variable numbers of round to irregular, variably sized, magenta-
staining cytoplasmic granules.
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Low numbers of nonneoplastic circulating granular lymphocytes may be
seen in dogs and cats secondary to immunostimulation. In particular, low to moderate numbers of
 granular lymphocytes may be seen in dogs, with or without a mild lymphocytosis and with ehrlichiosis.
Thus, as with CLL, ruling out etiologies of immunostimulation and monitoring of the CBC over time
are needed to help confirm a leukemic process.
NEXI sTEPs: As for all of the lymphoid leukemias, assessment for lymphoreticular organ infiltration
is suggested for staging. Although commonly referred to as lymphocytic leukemia of granular lympho-
 Cytes, in dogs, this disorder actually arises in the spleen rather than in bone marrow.

HEMATOPOIETIC NEOPLASIA
Acute Myeloid Leukemid
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of acute leukemias composed of blast cells of one, or more
than one, of the myeloid cell lines: granulocytic (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils); monocytic; ery-
throid and megakaryocyfic. Finding 20% or more blasts in blood or bone marrow is useful in diagnosis.
In overt AML, blasts are present in blood and bone marrow in very high numbers, with cytoperias and
possible lymphoreticular organ infiltration.
 As with all acute leukemias, lineage is best determined through a combination of light-microscopic
evaluation and assessment of phenotype by using cytochemical stains or immunophenotyping by flow
cytometry.
AML must be distinguished from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), especially with feline leukemia
  ae q  m s   s ossaa so  s p-a) s
CBC, as MDS may progress to AML.
Acute Undifferentiated Leukemia
DISTINCTIvE FEATURES: Acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) is composed of blast cells of uncharacter-
ized lineage (lymphoid or myeloid), where the cells lack any defining morphologic feafures and may
have feafures of blasts of various lineages. The cells also lack cytochemical, structural, and immunologic
markers to aid in determination of ontogeny.
AUL is diagnosed on the basis of the presence of greater than 20% of nucleated cells in blood or
bone marrow constituting blast. Indeed, blasts are offen in very high rumbers both in blood and bone
marrow.
Acufe Myeloblasfic Leukemia
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: The three subtypes of acute myeloblastic leukemia are AML-MO, AML-M1,
AML-M2, which are categorized by the degree of mafuration and cellular differentiation of the neoplastic
cells performed by microscopic evaluation and immunophenofypic assessmenf.
All three subcategories consist of 20% or more myeloblasts in blood, bone marrow, or both (usually
large numbers of blasts are present, offen approaching 100% of all rucleated cells).
Myeloblasts are difficult to distinguish from primifive blasts of other hematopoietic cell lines, and
sometimes even from lymphoblasts. Myeloblasts are about the same size, or slightly smaller than, pro-
myelocytes. They have round to oval, centrally located nuclei, which contain finely stippled chromatin
and one to several visible rucleoli. A small to moderate amount of moderately basophilic cytoplasm is
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: It is extremely rare to see myeloblasts in peripheral blood smears from
healthy dogs and cats. Finding a myeloblast in a peripheral blood smear always raises the concern of
granulocytic leukemia (although it must be kept in mind that it is difficult, if not impossible, to reliably
distinguish myeloblasts from lymphoblasts on the basis of morphology alone). However, rarely, a myelo-
blast may be seen in peripheral blood with severe inflammafion, as part of an orderly left shift with toxic
change. In addition, rare immafure hematopoietic precursors may be found in peripheral blood second-
ary to toxic or hypoxic damage to bone marrow.
 NEXT sTEPs: The persistent (progressive) presence of a few to large numbers of blasts in blood war-
rants bone marrow examination. Serial CBC and bone marrow examinations may be needed for
diagnosis, especially if the leukemia is in an early stage (low numbers of blasts).
Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
blood, bone marrow, or both. Part of this count includes any identified myeloblasts as well.
The atypical-appearing promyelocytes may be hypergranular or poorly granular. Promyelocytes are
of the same size or slighfly larger fhan myeloblasts, with a slight increase in pale blue cytoplasm. When
granules are present, they are azurophilic, small, and evenly distributed. Nuclei are round and slighfly
smaller than those of the myeloblast. Lacy to coarse chromatin is seen, with faint or visible nucleoli

ACUTE ERYTHROLEUKEMIA 243
sometimes evident. Usually, nucleoli are fewer and more difficult to visualize compared with
myeloblasts.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: AML-M3 is very uncommon and must be differentiated from a left shift
caused by severe inflammation or infection and from myelodysplastic syndromes.
Acufe Myelomonocytic Leukemia
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: In acuite myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4), the neoplastic cells are of mixed
lineage, consisting of both immafure myeloid cells and monocytic cells
Bone marrow cytology is needed for diagnosis and is based on 20% or more of all nucleated bone
marrow cells constifufing myeloblasts, monoblasts, or promonocytes; 20% or more of all nucleated bone
marrow cells having to be of monocytic lineage; and 20% or more of all nucleated bone marrow cells
having to be of granulocytic lineage.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Bone marrow cytology and cytochemical stains are helpful in distinguish-
 ing myeloid cells from cells of monocytic lineage when cell counts are performed.
Acute Monocytic Leukemia
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5) is diagnosed on the basis of 80% or more
of all nucleated cells being of monocytic origin, wifth 20% or more of all nucleated cells consisting of
myeloblasts, monoblasts, or promonocytes.
Of the fwo subtypes, AML-M5a is composed of more immafure monocyfic cells (acute monoblastic
leukemia) and is more common in young animals. Here, monoblasts comprise 50% or more of monocytic
cells. The second subtype, AML-M5b, is composed of more mafure monocytic cells (acute monocytic
leukemia) and is seen most often in older arimals, and 50% or more of the monocytic cells are
promonocytes
 Monoblasts are roundish cells with a moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm and a round to oval
nucleus that has an undulating outline. The nuclear chromatin ranges from stippled to stringy, and one
or more nucleoli are visible. The irregular outline to the nuclear membrane is one of the more distin-
guishing feafures of the monoblast.
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Bone marrow cytology and cytochemical stains are helpful in the diagnosis
of AML-M4
Acute Erythroleukemia
DISTINCTIvE FEATURES: Acute erythroleukemia (AML-M6) is diagnosed by the presence of greater than
50% erythroid precursors in bone marrow. The fwo subtypes are AML-M6a, in which 20% or more of all
bone marrow rucleated cells are myeloblasts. AML-M6b is characterized by 20% or more of all bone
marrow nucleated cells consisting of myeloblasts and rubriblasts. The peripheral blood picfure offen
contains large numbers of immafure eryfhroid and myeloid cells, with dysplastic erythroid elements
often seen in both subtypes.
Rubriblasts are round cells with dark blue cytoplasm and a roundish nucleus that is often centrally
located but may be eccentrically placed. The nuclear chromatin is stippled, and one or more nucleoli are
visible.
DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE: AML-M6b is the subtype most commorly seen in arnimals, especially in
FeLV-positive cats. AML-M6 must be differenfiated from myelodysplastic syndromes, also frequently
associated with FeLV infection in cats.
Rubriblasts are generally not seen in peripheral blood smears from healthy dogs and cats. Rubriblasts
may rarely be seen with strongly regenerative anemia such as immune-mediated anemia in dogs and
Mycoplasma hemofelis infecfion in cats. Also, rubriblasts may be seen in peripheral blood smears from

HEMATOPOIETIC NEOPLASIA
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
All forms of chronic myelogenous leukemia are uncommon in dogs and cats and, when diagnosed, are
most often a disease of older animals. The chronic leukemias are composed of mafure, well-differentiated
cells that are morphologically similar to their nonneoplastic counterparts. Diagnosis is based on finding
large numbers of mafure cells in peripheral blood that carnot be explained by underlying etiologies,
which may be challenging at times. Oter, serial CBC examinations are needed to document persistenfly
high and, offen, slowly increasing numbers of cells.
In confrast to acute leukemias, which consist of rapidly dividing blasts, which quickly efface fhe
marrow and result in significant and often multiple cytopenias at the time of diagnosis, chronic leukemias
are composed of mature, slowly developing and dividing cells. Thus, typically, cytoperias evolve only
when high numbers of leukemic cells are present in peripheral blood.
Similar to chroric lymphocytic leukemia, moritoring of the CBC over time is needed to evaluate for
an evolving blast crisis, signaling a fransifion from chronic leukemia to acute leukemia.
Chronic Granulocytic Leukemia
DISTINCTIvE FEATURES: Chroric granulocytic leukemia is diagnosed by the presence of large numbers
 Of neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Mature forms predomi-
nate, with a left shift composed of lower numbers of immafure forms (bands to myeloblasts). Dysplastic
changes may be present.

Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
DISTINCTIvE FEATURES: Chronic myelomonocyfic leukemia is diagnosed on the basis of large numbers
 Of mafure neutrophils and monocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow. It may be associated with
cytopenias in the later stages of disease.
Polycythemia Vera
DISTINCTIvE FEATUREs: Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chroric leukemia of dogs and cats, in which persis-
tent, unexplained polycythemia exists.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Diagnosis of PV is based on excluding two much more common causes of
polycythemia: (1) relative polycythemia and (2) nonneoplastic absolute polycythemia.
Relative polycythemia is secondary to dehydrafion or spleric contraction (catecholamine release
caused by excifement). Dehydration may be determined by physical examination and by the presence
of panhyperproteinemia or hyperalbuminemia and prerenal azotemia.
 Norneoplastic etiologies of absolute polycythemia may be appropriate physiologic responses such as
production of erythropoietin (EPO) secondary to hypoxia from cardiac disease, respiratory disease, or
both, resulting in an increase in RBC production. Assessment to rule out disease of the heart and lungs
(auscultation of the thorax, thoracic radiography, ultrasonography, electrocardiography), blood gas
assessment to confirm hypoxia, and measurement of EPO levels aid in diagnosis.
 Inappropriate causes of absolute polycythemia are from increased EPO production in the absence of
hypoxia, as in EPO-secreting neoplasms of the kidney or EPO secretior secondary to nonneoplastic renal
disease. These are diagnosed when hypoxia is ruled out through blood gas assessment and measurement
Of EPO.
Addifionally, some endocrinopathies such as hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing disease) and hyperthy-
roidism may result in polycythemia (hormonal stimulation of erythropoiesis) and may be diagnosed
with a combination of serum chemistry tests, physical examination findings, and patient history.
Essential Thrombocythemia
Diagnosis is based on the identificafion of sustained, chronic, unexplained, marked thrombocytosis wifh
megakaryocytic hyperplasia of bone marrow. Platelets are usually normal in appearance but may be of
variable size. Dysplastic changes and associated cytoperias are not commonly seen.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Diagnosis of ET is based on excluding all causes of nonneoplastic throm-
bocyfoses, the most common of which is a reactive thrombocytosis secondary fo underlying inflamma-
thrombocytosis are secondary to cerfain drugs and splenic contraction (epinephrine release).
Addifionally, thrombocytosis may also be seen with some forms of leukemia such as basophilic leu-
kemia, PV, and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

HEMATOPOIETIC NEOPLASIA
Mitotic Figures
DISTINCTIVE FEATUREs: Mitotic figures are cells undergoing cell division. A well-defined nucleus is nof
seen; instead, chromatids are seen as dark purple (same color as the nucleus), linear structures forming
 a spindle. Mitotic cells may be found in any stage of mitoses, and thus, chromatids may be concentrated
in the center of the cell, forming a spindle shape or pulled apart from the center and found in fwo polar
 groups. If the cell undergoing division is neoplastic, aberrant mitoses, in which the chromatids are dis-
 persed randomly throughout the cytoplasm of the cell and appear disorganized, may be seen.
DIAGNOsTIC SIGNIFICANCE: Mitofic figures are not normally seen in the peripheral blood of normal
dogs and cats. When present, they are offen found at the feafhered edges of the blood smear. Rarely.
mitotic figures are seen in the peripheral blood of nonleukemic animals, in cases of reacfive lymphocy-
tosis, and rarely in cats with strongly regenerative anemias. Usually, when mitotic figures are found on
peripheral blood smears, they are parf of a leukemic cell population. Therefore, when mitotic figures are
identified in peripheral blood smears, assessment for underlying leukemia is warranted.

APPENDIX
Reticulocyte Count
The reticulocyte count, which is used to assess bone marrow response to anemia, is a more sensifive
measurement of bone marrow regenerative response than is polychromasia because a greater concentra-
tion of ribosomes in red blood cell (RBC) cytoplasm is required for RBCs to stain polychromatophilic
with Romanowsky-type (Wright) stains than is required for RBC to stain as reticulocytes with supravital
stains (new methylene blue [NMB]). Thus, all polychromatophilic cells stain as reticulocytes wifth supra-
vital stains, whereas some reticulocytes do not stain polychromatophilic with Romanowsky-type stains.
 The reticulocyte count may be performed in-house or by referral laboratories. Box 1 gives the procedure
for performing in-house reticulocyte counts. Referral laboratories may perform reticulocyte counts on
 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples submitted for hemogram analysis or for other
reasons. Relative reticulocyte counts are reported as the percentage of RBCs that are reticulocytes. Abso-
lute reticulocyte counts are reported as the number of reticulocytes per volume of blood. When possible,
 the absolute reticulocyte count should be used to evaluate the regenerative response rather than the rela-
tive reticulocyte count.
Reticulocytes are young RBCs containing a sufficient concentration of polyribosomes so that after

gates. Reticulocytes do not increase to what is considered adequate levels to immediately classify an
anemia as regenerative. It takes approximately 2 days for the number of young RBCs to increase in
the circulation and 5 to 7 days for them to reach a maximum level with most acute anemias fhat are
BOx 1  New Methylene Blue Stain for Reticulocytes
A. Principle
 New methylene blue is a cationic dye capable of penetrating the living cell and precipitating
the ribosomes of the immature red blood cell (RBC). In the reticulocyte, new methylene
blue (NMB) stain precipitates with the remnants of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). which
is primarily the ribosome and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for hemoglobin synthesis.
As the RBC matures, the ER is lost, so only cells recently released from bone marrow into
the circulation will contain the ER. Therefore. the reticulocyte count estimates the bone
marrow response to anemia.
B. Procedure
 1. Place equal amounts of NMB stain and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood
in a test tube for 20 minutes.
2. From this mixture. make a blood smear
 3. Count 10o0 RBCs. recording the number of reticulocytes observed in these 10o0 cells.

regenerafive (hemorrhage or hemolysis). Therefore, an acute anemia may appear norregenerafive by a
reticulocyte count performed before young RBCs have increased in the circulafion.
In dogs and cats, the reticulocyte count increases proportionately to the severity of anemia if the
anemia is regenerafive (ie., bone marrow regenerafion is occurring appropriately in response fo fhe
anemia). As erythropoiesis increases in response to anemia, young RBCs are released into the circulafion
1 to 2 days earlier than normal. As a result, they are within the circulafion but still stainable as reticulo-
cytes for 1 or 2 days longer than under normal conditions. Also, the increase in erythropoiesis causes
by an increase in peripheral blood reticulocyte count proportional to the magnifude of increased eryth-
ropoiesis, which is, in furn, proporfional to the severity of anemia.
 In cats, reticulocytes may be divided into two morphologic classes: (1) punctate reticulocytes and (2)
aggregate reticulocytes. Punctate reticulocytes are RBCs containing a few small, dotlike (punctate), blue-
locytes are RBCs confaining one or more medium to large, blue-black strucfures that may appear as a
cluster or network of aggregated strucfures. Punctate and aggregate reticulocytes should be differenti-
ated and counted separately. Counfing the number of punctate reticulocytes may be very time consum-
ing, as they can reach very high numbers. Therefore, in moderate to severe anemias, punctate reticulocytes
of aggregate reficulocyte numbers in moderate to severe anemias.
Feline punctate reficulocytes represent a later mafurational stage of feline aggregate reticulocytes. The
feline aggregate reticulocyte circulates only about 1 day before sufficient ribosomes are degraded for it
in bone marrow until they reach the punctate stage, resulting in liftle or no increase in peripheral blood
aggregate reticulocyte numbers. Feline punctate reticulocytes may occur in high numbers (up to 10%)
in health, increase during regenerafive anemia, and may be elevated during mild regenerafive anemia
vated during severe nonregenerative or poorly regenerative anemias without an appropriate concurrent
elevation of feline aggregate reticulocytes. Because feline punctate reticulocytes may be increased during
high numbers of punctate reticulocytes in a cat with mild anemia of sufficient durafion to allow bone
marrow response suggests regenerafive anemia, even if the aggregate reficulocyfe count is not increased.
Whereas, an absence of an increase in punctate reficulocytes in fhe peripheral blood of a cat wifh mild
anemia of sufficient durafion to allow bone marrow response suggests nonregenerafive anemia unless
an increase in aggregate reficulocytes occurs. Ir cats, an increase in the aggregate reficulocytes wifthouf
days, the increased numbers of aggregate reticulocytes will mature, causing an increase in punctate
reticulocyte numbers. Cats with moderate to severe anemia of sufficient durafion to allow bone marrow
response should have an increased aggregate reticulocyte count. If they do not, the anemia is very likely
   e  e m r  r (   a e  s 
 0.1% and a punctate reticulocyte count of 25% has a nonregenerative anemia. If punctate reticulocytes
sified as regenerative anemias; however, failure to count punctate reticulocytes may cause some ade-
quately regenerafive mild anemias tfo be misclassified as inadequately regenerafive.
Absolute Reticulocyte Count
The absolute reticulocyte count is the number of reticulocytes per microliter (reticulocytes/μL) of blood.
The absolute reficulocyte count more accurately reflects the bone marrow's response compared with the
percent reticulocyte count because it automatically adjusts for the decrease in mafure RBC numbers,
prevenfing a misimpression of increase in reficulocytes that may be given by percent reficulocyte counf
during anemia. For example, a dog that normally has a PCV of 40%, an RBC count of 6,000,000
reticulocytes/μL, and a percent reticulocyte count of 1% would have an absolute reticulocyte count of
60,000/μL (1% of 6,000,000 = 60,000). If the dog becomes severely anemic with the hematocrit (HCT)
and RBC count dropping to one fourth of the original values (10 and 1,500,000 reticulocytes/μL, respec-
ftively), a reficulocyte court of 3% would appear to indicate increased bone marrow reticulocyte produc
tion, whern, in reality, a 3% reticulocyte count with a 1,500,000/μL RBC count represents only 45,000
reticulocytes/μL Hence, although the percent reficulocyte count was increased, the acfual number of

reficulocytes in peripheral blood was decreased, indicating a norregenerative, or poorly regenerafive,
anemia.
Basal Reticulocyte Production Rate
In dogs, a basal reticulocyte production rate (BRPR) has been determined empirically and may be par-
ficularly useful for evaluafing a regenerafive response when orly HCT and percent reficulocytes are
known. The BRPR adjusts for the decrease in numbers of mafure RBCs, the increased time that reticu-
fhe expected proporfional increase in erythropoiesis as fhe severity of anemia increases. To determine
the BRPR, the patient's percent reticulocyte count is multiplied by the pafient's acfual HCT divided
by the pafient's expected normal HCT (usually predicted as 40), and the resulting value is divided by
the appropriate BRPR correction factor. BRPRs above 1 indicate adequate bone marrow response to the
anemia, whereas those less than 1 indicate inadequate bone marrow response to the anemia. Thus far,
BRPR correcfion factors have been determined orly for dogs. The formula and the correction factors
used for calculating the BRPR are giver in Box 2 along with a sample calculation.
 Saline Dilution or Dispersion Test
RBC aufoagglufination and rouleaux formafion may be differenfiated by saline dilution. Saline dilution
may be performed by mixing equal amounts of physiologic saline and EDTA-anticoagulated blood,
placing a drop of the mixture on a microscope slide, then placing a coverslip over the saline-blood
mixfure, and examining the unstained mixfure microscopically for clumping. If the clumping is caused
by autoagglutination, cell clumps will persist after saline dilution, and an unorganized or random
(agglutinated) association of RBCs will be recognized. If clumping is caused by rouleaux formation, the
cells will either disperse into individual cells, or an organized side-to-side rouleaux paftern (resembling
a roll of coins) will easily be recognized.
