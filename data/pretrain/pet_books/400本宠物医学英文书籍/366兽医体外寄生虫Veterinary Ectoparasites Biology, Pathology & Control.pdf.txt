sources, escape predators, find mates and colonise
new habitats. In several groups of insect, such as
grasshoppers, true bugs and beetles, the front
wings have been modified to various degrees as
protective coverings for the hind wings and
abdomen. In the true flies (the Diptera) the hind
wings have been reduced to form a pair of club-
like halteres, which are used as stabilising organs
to assist in flight.
The abdomen is composed of 9 to ll segments,
although the tenth and eleventh segments are
usually small and not externally visible and the
eleventh segment has been lost in most advanced
groups. The genital ducts open ventrally on seg-

ecology are highly adapted to a life of intimate
contact with their host. The empodium is claw-
like and the pulvillus is borme on a stalk-like
pretarsus. Paired claws on the tarsus are absent.
They have circular bodies with the ventral surface
somewhat flattened. The coxae are sunk into the
body, creating a characteristic ‘short-legged'
appearance; from a dorsal view, the legs only just
project beyond the edge of the body and the
posterior two pairs may not be visible at all. The
chelicerae are usually adapted for cutting or
sucking. The cuticle may be covered by fine
striations. There are three genera of veterinary
importance: Sarcoptes, Notoedres and Trixicarus.

Species of the genus Knemidocoptes are the only
 astigmatid burrowing mites found on poultry and
domestic birds. Twelve species have been descri-
bed, of which three are of veterinary importance.
Their main body features are similar to Sarcoptes,
but the dorsal surface has no spines and only faint
and irregular scales. The anus is dorsal. The
round body, short stubby legs and bird host are
generally sufficient for a rough initial identifica-
tion to the family and genus level. All members of
this genus are parasites of birds.

2.8.3 Trombiculidae
More than 1500 species of the family Trombicu-
lidae have been described, about 50 of which are
known to attack domestic animals and humans.
They are commonly known as chiggers, red bugs,
harvest mites and scrub itch mites and are unique,
in that only the larval stage is ectoparasitic. In the
adult and nymphal stages they are believed to be
predators on the eggs and larvae of other
arthropods. The principal species of veterinary
interest are in the genus Trombicula.
The genus Trombicufa is divided into a number
of subgenera of which two contain species of
veterinary interest: Neotrombicula and Eutrombi-
cula. Key species are the harvest mite, Trombicula
(Neotrombicula) autumnalis, in Europe; the
chiggers, Trombicula (Eutrombicula) alfreddugesi
and Trombicula (Eutrombicula) splendens,in the

(a) Pyemotidae
Species of Pyemotidae are soft-bodied, pre-
dacious mites which infest materials such as grain
or hay. They are often described as forage mites.
They feed largely on insect larvae but will attack
domestic animals and humans that come into
contact with the infested material, causing der-
matitis. Human infestation occurs only acciden-
tally and temporally.
They are small mites with elongated bodies.
Adults have greatly reduced mouthparts and
stylet-like chelicerae. There are several species, of
which Pyemotes tritici, the grain itch mite, is
particularly damaging.

life-cycle is rapid, requiring a minimum of 13
days. The female survives for up to 70 days,
during which time she feeds every couple of days

 Ixodes is the largest genus in the family Ixodidae,
with about 250 species. The second segment of the
 palps may be restricted at the base, creating a gap
between the palp and chelicerae (Fig. 3.9). The
mouthparts are long and are longer in the female

 greatly reduced and bears chemoreceptor sensilla.
They are small, inornate ticks which do not have

surface. Ixodes can be distinguished from other
ixodid ticks by the anterior position of the anal

the anus.

Adult Flies (Diptera)
4.1 INTRODUCTION

The Diptera are the true flies. In most orders of

winged insect, adults have two pairs of wings.

However, the Diptera have only one pair, the
hind pair of wings having been reduced con-
siderably to become small, club-like organs called
halteres which help the insect to maintain stable
flight. Hence, the word Diptera is derived from

4.7.1 Muscidae
The Muscidae is the second largest of the calyp-

family contains a number of subfamilies and
genera of veterinary importance, notably the
genera Hydrotaea, Musca, Stomoxys and Hae-
matobia. Species of the latter two genera are
blood-feeders and together form the subfamily
Stomoxyinae.
Musca

The genus Musca contains about 60 species, of
which the cosmopolitan house fly,  Musca

of particular importance. Musca aufumnalis is

The precise status of C. bezziana as a clinical
and economic pest is uncertain, particularly in
subSaharan Africa, and few studies have been
able to obtain quantitative estimates of myiasis
incidence, or its clinical or economic importance.
The absence of livestock throughout much of its
range in subSaharan Africa, due to the presence
of trypanosomiasis and its vector the tsetse fly,
may substantially limit its economic impact.
However, C. bezziana has been inadvertently
introduced into several countries in the Middle
East, and such an introduction is believed to pose

5.8.3 Lucilia
There are at least 27 species in the genus Lucilia.
However, only two species, Lucilia sericata and
Lucilia cuprina, are of major clinical and eco-
nomic significance worldwide as primary agents
of cutaneous myiasis, particularly affecting sheep,
although they may also strike a range of other
wild and domestic animals and humans. Lucilia
sericata and L. cuprina may be described, incor-
rectly, as members of a subgenus Phaenicia by
some authors. A number of other species, parti-
cularly Lucilia caesar, Lucilia illustris and Lucilia
ampullacea, may also be found occasionally as
faculta tive agents of myiasis.

5.9 SARCOPHAGIDAE
The Sarcophagidae, known as flesh flies, are grey-
black, non-metallic, medium to large flies with
prominent stripes on the thorax (Fig. 5.21). There
are over 2000 species in the family Sarcophagidae,
divided into 400 genera. Most species of Sarco-
phaga are of no veterinary importance, breeding
in excrement, carrion and other decomposing
organic matter. The only important genus of the
family Sarcophagidae containing species which
 act as agents of veterinary myiasis is Wohlfahrtia.

The most economically important species in the
genus Wohlfahrtia is Wohlfahrtia magnifica. This
is an obligate larval parasite causing traumatic

The behavioural differences between dog and
cat fleas seem largely to involve the range of
environmental conditions which their larvae are
capable of tolerating. While household dogs in
 northern Europe and North America are more
likely to be infested by the cat flea, working dogs
in kennels and dogs in rural areas or at higher
altitudes are more likely to be infested by C. canis.
Dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, foxes and humans have
all been recorded as hosts of C. canis.

Life-cycle: the life-cycle is typical: egg, three lar-

begin ovipositing she needs to feed on the host
several times. Unlike most other fleas, which
often remain on the host and feed for long peri-
ods, chicken fleas spend most of their time in the
nest of the host, and only move on to the birds to
feed for short periods.
The larvae feed on detritus amongst the nest
material and on undigested blood from the adult
faeces. The larval stages are completed in a few
weeks, before the pupal cocoon is spun. The flea
overwinters in the cocoon and emerges in an old
nest in spring as temperatures rise. Large num-

common on caged layers. The lice eat the barbs

common on the breast, thighs and around the

under the wings and on other parts of the body,
including the head. After introduction into a flock

Menopon gallinae
Morphology: the shaft louse, M. gallinae, is pale
yellow in colour. It is a small louse; adults are
about 2 mm in length. It has small palps and a
pair of four-segmented antennae, folded into
grooves in the head (Fig. 7.4b). The abdomen is
tapered posteriorly in the female and rounded in
the male and has a sparse covering of small to
medium-length setae on its dorsal surface.
Life-cycle: adult females lay their eggs in clusters
at the base of a feather. Eggs hatch into nymphs,

Veterinary Ectoparasites: Biology, Pathology and Control
Pathology: these two species are commonly found
on guinea-pigs. Originally endemic to the Nearc-
tic, they have now been transported worldwide
with the spread of their host. Gliricola porcelli is
typically widespread on body fur, whilst Gyropus
ovalis tends to congregate around the back of the
head and throat. Both species eat skin debris and
sebaceous secretions from the base of the hair.
Light infestations may cause few problems. Irri-
tation will cause the host to scratch, particularly
behind the ears. Heavier infestations may result in
pruritus, a harsh coat and alopecia.
