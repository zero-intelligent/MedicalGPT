8PREFACE
Emergency and critical care is one of the fastest growing fields of veterinary medicine
Veterinarians engaged in emergency veterinary medical practice must be able to recognize
and manage a dizzying array of diseases. Virtually every life-threatening disease can present
for emergency evaluation, and the emergency clinician must be prepared to successfully
 i  o o   e s  s  
including internal medicine, neurology, cardiology, oncology, anesthesia, and many other
fields. T'he emergency clinician must be prepared to make a quick assessment or diagnosis,
and then follow these decisions with action regarding surgery, diagnostics, and medical
interventions. T'he appropriateness of these actions can mean the dlifference between life
and death for the animal
In contrast, the critical care veterinary clinician often has a good working knowledge of the
primary disease, and some therapy has typically been initiated by the time the critical care
veterinarian becomes involved. T'he criticalist is required to recognize subtle changes in the
clinical course of animals, often in a stressful 24-hours-a-day environment, and to take
corrective action before severe systemic disease becomes irreversible. Clinical decisions
regarding seemingly smallitems, such as fluid therapy, antibiotics or analgesics, can have
a profound impact on patient outcome. T'he best criticalist uses a combination of years
of experience, a solid understanding of pathophysiology of all organ systems, and acute
clinical acumen.
This manual is intended to complement comprehensive textbooks of emergency and
critical care medicine, and other texts which provide the required fundamental basics
of pathophysiology, pharmacology, surgery, or internal medicine. Certain diseases occur
commonly, and certain predictable dilemmas arise in the intensive care unit. Some diseases
or clinical problems can be best demonstrated or described with accompanying
illustrations. The main aim of the book is to discuss management of the common
clinical conditions and scenarios that we encounter in our clinical practice, with the hope
that these will also be common dilemmas for the reader. T'here can be many successful
approaches in clinical medicine, especially in a rapidly developing field like emergency and
critical care, and our biases in the medical and surgical approach to certain diseases will
undoubtedlly show. We have inclucded figures or illustrations for situations where an image
can do greater justice to the topic than a lengthy textual description and have highlighted
key information in tabular form. T'he aim is to bring this information into a small manua
which might be a ready resource for clinicians actively engaged in the field. We hope that
you will find this manual on the counter or dlesk more often than on the bookshelf.

Hypovolemic shock is considered the most

Estimates for the volumes of blood loss that may

Certainly, a young healthy dog will tolerate blood
loss significantly betterthan an older pet. Healthy
dogs may tolerate up to a 40% loss of blood

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
Common rhythm disorders identified at the time
of CPA in dogs and cats include asystole, ventri-
cular fibrillation, sinus bradycardia, and EMD
(electromechanical dissociation). The arrhythmia
may be the result of primary cardiac disease
(e.g. dilated cardiomyopathy) or severe systemic
disease which has lead to cardiac instability (e.g.
trauma, pancreatitis). Thromboembolic disor-
ders, such as PTE or thromboembolic disease to
the coronary arteries, are other possible causes of
sudden, otherwise unexplained CPA.
Factors which often contribute to CPA
include hypoxemia or cellular hypoxia due to
respiratory disease and/or poor tissue perfusion,
hypovolemia or fluid overload, narcotics admin-
istered for analgesia or other anesthetic agents,
acidosis, anemia, CNS depression leading to
reduced ventilatory drive from disease or drugs,
coagulopathy, electrolyte disturbance, and myo-
cardial disease.
A pre-existing cardiovascular, respiratory, or
CNS disorderis typically present in dogs and cats
with spontaneous CPA. Following CPR in any

Long-term management
 For chronic management of CHF, exercise limi-
tation, dietary sodium restriction, diuretic
therapy, and ACE inhibitors usually form the
backbone of therapy. Cough, often due to left
 atrial enlargement, may be a troublesome long-
term management concern (19, 20).

ital defects, the prognosis for dogs with CHF is
always guarded. Many dogs respond well to initi-
ation of medications and dietary recommenda-
tions, while others fail to respond or encounter
repeated side effects or bouts of CHF. To some
degree, the dedication of the owner and the
20
owner's financial means can play a big role in the
 outcome for dogs with CHF. While a 2-year
survival is possible for some dogs with chronic
valvular disease, a 6-month to l-year survival
might be more typical once CHF has developed.
In dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy the
survival is often shorter than that of dogs with
mitral regurgitation due to chronic valvular
disease. In one study, the median survival was

DEFINITION / OVERVIEWW
CHF can be defined as the presence of fluid

MANAGEMENT / TREATMENT
27a
Emergency management
 Emergency management of CHF in cats can
be one of the most challenging emergencies
faced by a veterinarian; however, successful
 management can be very rewarding. Oxygen
therapy, appropriate doses of furosemide, nitrates,
and thoracocentesis for cats with moderate to
large volumes of pleural effusion are the key
 treatment approaches in most cases (27). Limited
stress is a crucial aspect of emergency care for
dyspneic cats suspected to have CHF.
Once a diagnosis of CHF is suspected, cats
should be given 4 mg/kg furosemide IM or IV
by direct medial saphenous vein injection and
27b
placed in an oxygen cage. Transcutaneous nitro-
glycerine (glyceryl trinitrate) can be used and is
administered as 3-6 mm (0.125-0.25 inch) of
the 2% paste formulation applied to the inner
pinna, inguinal region, or oral membranes
q6-8hr.
Blood should not be drawn, an intravenous
catheter should not be placed, and if radiographs 
have not yet been obtained then it is advised that
1-3 hours of initial treatment and oxygen cage
 stabilization be allowed before radiography is
attempted. Cats are very susceptible to stress-
induced deterioration of dyspnea, especially when
they have first arrived in a new and unfamiliar
environment. Once dyspnea is improved then it
is safer to place an intravenous catheter and
perform additional testing. Empinic thoracocen-
tesis is not recommended for cats with pulmonary
crackles; however, thoracocentesis prior to radi-

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Historical signs
The history in dogs with cardiac arrhythmia
usually reflects the systemic disease which leads to
cardiac arhythmia (i.e.vomiting, hemoabdomen,
and so on). Animals with primary cardiac
disease may have a history of collapse, dyspnea,
 tachypnea, cough, weakness,abdominal distention,
 or reduced capacity for exercise.
Physical examination findings
Identification ofa tachycardia (28), a bradycardia

can be identified as an irregular rhythm with a

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
The three factors (Virchow's triad) thought to
contribute to thrombus formation in animals are
altered coagulability, altered blood flow, and
endothelial damage. Cardiomyopathy is the most
common cause of arterial thromboembolism in
cats. Other causes in cats include pulmonary
carcinoma (5l), heartworm disease in aberrant

Heparin
Heparin is often used to prevent further enlarge-
ment of the thrombus. While several doses of
heparin have been proposed, a high dose of
heparin (200-300 U/kg q6-8hr SC) is recom-
mended once arterial thromboembolism has
been diagnosed. Heparin can be administered
subcutaneously or intravenously, and an initial

therapy has been initiated for at least 72 hours.
Surgical treatment
Surgical thrombolectomy can be attempted for
removal ofthe thrombus. Although there is little
published on the use of thrombolectomy, the
dogma is that cats with arterial thromboem-
bolism treated with thrombolectomy do poorly
in the peri-operative period.
Preventative medication
Prevention of repeated episodes of arterial throm-
boembolism can be attempted with a number of
medications, including aspirin, coumadin and low

DEFINITION / OVERVIEW
that has a high mortality.
Syncope is a more common cause of emergency
presentation in dogs than in cats. Syncope is
defined as a sudden, transient loss of conscious-
ness with spontaneous recovery. Syncope is an
alarming occurrence for an owner and can be
a warning sign that occurs before sudden death.
 In other disease processes, such as vasovagal
syncope, syncope can occur repeatedly and never
result in sudden death. Syncope is a clinical
sign of an underlying disease and diagnostic
testing is indicated to search for the cause of
syncope.
ETIOLOGY
Causes of syncope include bradyarrhythmias,
tachyarrhythmias, low cardiac output due to
a variety of cardiac diseases or drugs, hypo-
glycemia, hypoxia, and hyperviscosity syndromes.
Hypotension due to hypovolemia or inadequate
vascular tone (e.g. due to vasodilators) can also
result in or predispose to syncope. Dogs with
chronic valvular disease can experience syncope,
often at the time of the original occurrence of
CHF, and the etiology of syncope in these cases
can be elusive. Paroxysmal coughing can cause
syncope (tussive syncope or ‘cough-drop
 syndrome') and one ofthe most common causes
of syncope is a vagally mediated reflex that leads
to bradycardia and hypotension, termed vaso-
vagal or neurocardiogenic syncope.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Syncope develops when the CNS is deprived of
blood flow, leading to reduced delivery of oxygen
and other metabolites, and the result is a loss of
consciousness. In most dogs with arrhythmic
collapse, a pause in the cardiac rhythm of7-12 s
is required before syncope is seen (56, 57).

pacemaker implantation is not an option, based

Anticholinergic drugs (e.g. propantheline
bromide), sympathomimetic drugs (e.g. terbu-
taline), and theophylline or aminophylline are
useful in selected cases to increase the heart rate
and/or improve conduction across the AV
node. Tachyarrhythmias are usually treated
medically.

64  Cardiac emergencies
Syncope that develops in dogs with CHF can
result from cardiac arrhythmias, abnormal baro-
receptor function, and drug-induced hypo-
 tension. Digoxin is useful for eliminating syncope
in many dogs with chronic valvular disease and
syncope of uncertain cause. Dogs with chronic
valvular disease and concurrent respiratory
disease may respond favorably to either theo-
 phylline or antitussive drugs.
Vasovagal syncope, sometimes diagnosed
in young Boxers, may respond to metoprolol
(Lopressor). When syncope is associated with
an underlying disease process that results in
hypovolemia, anemia, or hypoglycemia, treat-
ment of the underlying disease will often
eliminate syncope.
PROGNOSIS
Prognosis for animals with syncope is usually
related to the prognosis for the underlying
disease.

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
The cause of feline asthma is unknown. One
study has documented an increased incidence in
Siamese cats and, anecdotally, cats with severe
respiratory infections as kittens or those exposed
to high concentrations of allergens seem more
commonly affected. Some cats also appear
seasonally affected.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Inflammatory or reactive airways develop in
response to a stimulus. The bronchial wall may
become edematous and goblet cells hypertrophy,
resulting in excessive mucus production. Smooth

muscle hypertrophy develops. The end result is a
narrowing of the airway lumen and subsequent
increase in resistance to air flow. Expiratory flow

apparent.

MANAGEMENT / TREATMENT
Traumatic pneumothorax is most commonly
successfully managed conservatively, with needle
thoracocentesis as needed. Animals that require
multiple (more than three) thoracocenteses over
a 24-hour period for management of a pneu-
mothorax may benefit from the placement of a
thoracic tube and the application of continuous
suction to ensure re-inflation. Traumatic pneu-
mothorax is rarely surgical, although pene-

trating bite wounds may damage the lung lobe
severely enough to necessitate lobectomy. Reso-
lution of residual pneumothorax will occur over
days to weeks, depending upon the volume of
the pneumothorax. If desired, supplemental
 oxygen will hasten the re-absorption of the
pneumothorax by creating a nitrogen gradient
between the blood and the pneumothorax.
Spontaneous pneumothorax is considered a
surgical disease in dogs. Most cases are due to the
presence of a bulla or sub-pleural bleb and will
 not resolve without resection. In a few cases, such
as pneumonia, asthma, or diroflarasis, medical
management may be warranted. Careful atten-
tion to patient condition and clear communica-
tion with the owner are required for successful
outcome.

MANAGEMENT / TREATMENT
The underlying cause ofthe hemorrhage should
be determined and corrected if possible. Intra-
venous fluids should be given to treat hypo-
volemic shock. A ^shock' dose of crystalloids may
be administered, recalling that the end-point of
fuid resuscitation is stabilization of vital signs,
not the delivery of a specific volume of fluid.
If the blood loss is moderate to severe and the
patient is showing signs of tachycardia or weak-
ness, a transfusion should be performed. Treat-
ment for other causes of blood loss include:
antiparasiticidal therapy; topical treatment for
fleas/ticks; vitamin K for suspected rodenticide

pump inhibitors for GI hemorrhage; and doxy.

Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes in the
bone marrow by cytoplasmic demarcation. They
are released directly into the blood stream and
circulate forabout 2-l0 days. Platelet production
is regulated by the hormone thrombopoietin.
This hormone is controlled by the circulating
platelet mass, not the platelet number. The
platelet count remains relatively stable because
the amount of platelets produced is equal to the

Activated charcoal is the most effective absorbent
available to veterinarians. It is available in combi-
nation with sorbitol, which acts as a cathartic. It
can be used as the sole decontamination step
when emesis and gastric lavage are not
performed. Activated charcoal absorbs many
common toxins. It should be noted that it does
not absorb small charged molecules, such as alco-
hols and strong acids/alkalis, and metals, such as 
lead and zinc.

Poisonous plants
Some common plants are potentially poisonous
to dogs and cats. Ideally, clients should be advised
to determine the potential toxicity of any plant
prior to bringing it into the house or yard (l03).
A number of sources are available to evaluate the
potential toxicity of various plants. It is important
to know the particular plants near the practice

Ethylene glycol
04
DEFINITION / OVERVIEWW
Ethylene glycol is commonly used as antifreeze in
the cooling systems of cars and trucks. It is a
colorless, odorless, sweet-tasting liquid. Many
manufacturers add either a bright green or pink
color to their product in order to make coolant
leaks easily detectable.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed after inges-
tion. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver.
The ethylene glycol molecule is metabolized by

MANAGEMENT / TREATMENT
The goals oftherapy are to minimize absorption
of the mycotoxin from the GI tract, control the
 tremors and seizures, and provide supportive
 care. As aspiration pneumonia has been reported
in dogs with tremorgenic mycotoxicosis, espe-
cially following sedation to control the tremors
and seizures, the potential benefit from the
 administration of activated charcoal and gastric
lavage must be carefully considered. Animals with
active tremors and seizures should not have these
procedures attempted until the CNS excitement
can be controlled. If the medication needed to
control the CNS excitement causes severe seda-
tion and suppression of the gag reflex, adminis-
tration of activated charcoal and gastric lavage
should be approached with great care due to the
risk of development of aspiration pneumonia.

Pyrethrin and

DEFINITION / OVERVIEWW
Pyrethrin and pyrethroid insecticides work by
increasing normal nerve membrane sodium ion
conduction. They are insecticides used in flea
control products and as agricultural products.
Typically, they are supplied as shampoos, foams,
dips, sprays, and topical applications. Toxicity
 most commonly occurs when a product labeled
for use in dogs is applied to a cat.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Clinical signs include ataxia, hyperexcitability,
convulsions, tremors, salivation, and whole body
tremors.
DIAGNOSIS
In most cases there is a history of pyrethrin/
 pyrethroid application. Clinical signs wil typically
develop between 2 and 48 hours after exposure.
 Animals will also frequently smellstrongly of pest
control products.
TREATMENT
In cases of dermal exposure, the dog orcat should
 be thoroughly bathed with warm soapy water.
The remainder of therapy is directed at alleviation
 ofclinical signs and supportive care. Treatment
usually consists of a muscle relaxant (methocar-
 bamol) and a sedative (diazepam). Acepromazine
and other phenothiazines should be avoided since
 they can exacerbate clinical signs.
PROGNOSIS
The prognosis for recovery is usually excellent.
Some cats exposed to large doses may require
therapy for as long as 5-7 days, however,
 2-3 days of supportive care is more typical.

DEFINITION / OVERVIEW
Vomiting is defined as the ejection of part or all 
 of the contents of the stomach through the
 mouth, usually in a series of involuntary spas-
modic movements. Persistent vomiting may
lead to dehydration, acid-base and electrolyte
disturbances, esophagitis, aspiration pneumonia,
and bradycardia resulting from stimulation of the
vasovagal reflex.

Further signs of fever, collapse, tachycardia, or

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Physiological consequences of gastric dilatation
include reduced venous return to the heart due
to compression of the posterior vena cava and
portal vein, leading to reduced cardiac output,
hypotension, and signs of shock. Subsequent
reduction in tissue perfusion contributes to the
development of lactic acidosis, cellular injury, and
organ dysfunction.

amylase and lipase are often considered to be
diagnostic of pancreatitis, this is not necessarily
the case. Amylase and lipase may be elevated as a
result of liver disease, primary GI disease, renal
disease, or the use of drugs, such as etherified
starches (e.g. hetastarch) or corticosteroids.
Amylase and lipase may also be normal in cases of
acute pancreatitis if inflammation leads to the
depletion of stored enzymes. Amylase and lipase
have no clinical utility in the diagnosis of pancre-
atitis in cats, as these enzymes are frequently
elevated as a result of nonpancreatic causes and
they may be decreased in cats with pancreatitis.

database, including serum renal values and
electrolytes, are all essential diagnostic compo-
nents. For example, cats commonly present
with urinary obstruction. A roaming dog may
be hit by a car and suffer traumatic bladder
rupture. A well-supervised, indoor cat may
chew on an Easter lily plant and develop ARF.
The following section provides a review of
ARF, CRF, and urinary obstruction. As veteri-
nary medicine becomes more specialized, more
sophisticated treatment options are available.
A review of dialysis is thus also presented.
Essentially, however, despite the increasing
availability of aggressive management options
for severe renal disease, the role of the emer-

DEFINITION / OVERVIEW
Seizures are the physical manifestation of an
abnormal balance between excitatory and
inhibitory tone in the central nervous system
(CNS). Seizures are categorized as either gener-
alized or partial (Table 10). Generalized seizures
include those that have traditionally been
described as convulsions or grand mal seizures.
 Partial seizures describe atypical behaviors, and
are classified as simple partial or complex partial

sizures. Generalized and partial seizures com
 monly require treatment, as both may represent
potentially life-threatening conditions.
ETIOLOGY

The CNS relies on a balance of excitatory tone

and inhibitory tone. Generally, excitatory tone is
mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, and
inhibitory tone is mediated by GABA. Depolar-

of glutamate to its receptors. Hyperpolarization of

148 Neurological emergencies
Vestibular syndrome
134
KEY POINTS
● Vestibular syndrome is a common cause of 
neurological emergency presentations.
+
Vestibular signs should be localized to the
 peripheral nervous system or CNS.
+
Peripheral vestibular syndrome commonly
resolves over 15 days.
+ Central vestibular syndrome is sometimes
static, but usually progresses.
● Animals with vestibular syndrome require
supportive therapy and nursing care for
optimal recovery.
134 Cat with central vestibular syndrome

common metabolic emergencies: diabetic

hypoadreno-
corticism, and disorders of calcium. Weakness,
lethargy, inappetence, PU/PD, and vomiting
are signs that are common to each of these
disorders. The spectrum of severity of these 
signs, however, is large. A proper triage may
assess the animal as stable. Alternatively, the
animal may present collapsed, requiring
immediate resuscitation. Interestingly, each of
these disorders can be identified with
evaluation ofa minimum database available in
 most emergency clinics: CBC, serum chem-
istry analysis, and urinalysis. Each of these
disorders demands medical interventions.
Ideally, the emergency clinician must be
respectful of the potential of any metabolic
disorder to derail and progress rapidly into a
spiral of deterioration that may result in the
death of the animal (137). Knowledge and
experience will enable the emergency clinician
to recognize the metabolic disorder before
it becomes a metabolic crisis.

Table 29 Protocol for insulin CRl
The amount of insulin may need to be titrated up or down. The goal is to maintain a relatively steady state for
blood glucose, while simultaneously providing exogenous insulin. In some patients, smaller adjustments are
required as standard ones cause large swings: in other patients, an increased dose of insulin is required to
maintain glycemic control. The insulin CRl protocol requires two intravenous catheters, ideally at least one of
which bleeds back easily. The patient will normally receive a set fuid rate per hour of crystalloids, combined with a

insulin to help reverse the ketogenesis. The starting insulin CRl is made by adding 1-2 U/kg regular insulin to 240
ml of 0.9% saline. For animals with suspected insulin resistance, the CRl is started with 2 U/kg of insulin. The
blood glucose is checked every 2-4 hours. The fluid rate is calculated using normal guidelines, recalling that
almost all diabetics are whole body potassium depleted.

MANAGEMENT / TREATMENT
144
 Appropriate management of bite wounds consists
of clipping and cleaning, wound debridement,
lavage, establishment of drainage, and antibiotic
therapy. All dog-inflicted bite wounds (with the
possible exception of the distal extremities)
should be surgically explored, as superficial skin
wounds frequently hide more significant under-
lying damage. The practice of probing bite
wounds with an instrument should not be
 performed as it frequently underestimates injury
severity. Probes may not be able to follow the
 path of a bite wound through the various planes
of moveable fascia and may therefore fail to iden-
 tify large pockets of dead space.
The cleaning and debridement process should
 proceed from the outside inward (i.e. starting

TREATMENT
If there is absolute fetal oversize or inadequate
pelvic diameter, a C-section should be per-
formed. If there is only one large baby or fetal
monster wedged in the canal, one can try to
manipulate it. In some cases gentle traction and
the addition oflubrication will allow the fetus to
 pass. However, in many cases this approach is
unsuccessful.
 Bitches and queen cats with primary uterine
inertia are usually healthy with normal calcium
concentrations. Oxytocin (see Appendix 3) is the
first line of treatment, however most animals with

be measured to detect low concentrations which
 may prevent adequate contractions, although
these are uncommon causes of dystocia.
Dystocia due to failure of the uterus to push
the fetus into the birth canal can be divided into
primary uterine inertia and secondary uterine
inertia. Primary uterine inertia is recognized
by lack of abdominal press. In some instances
when the litter is small, parturition does not occur
normally. It is hypothesized that there is not 
enough hormonal stimulation from the small
 number of fetuses to induce the normal process
of parturition. Diagnosis of primary uterine
 inertia is based on the failure of parturition to
Dccur within the expected period, or better, or the
failure of labor to follow a drop in temperature
within 24 hours. Secondary uterine inertia
follows a period of apparently normal labor,
which then ceases. Diagnosis is based on the lack
 of labor, without problems involving the birth
canal (no impingements or stuck puppies or
kittens) (157).

increase the chances of pyometra.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Pyometra is most commonly seen in older
bitches, but may occur in young bitches. The
158
pertinent history is that the bitch was in heat
within the last 2-3 months. Signs can occur as
early as the end of estrus. Bloody or purulent
discharge is usually noted by the owner. In some
cases, there is no discharge (closed-cervix pyo-
metra). In these cases, the bitch presents not as a
reproductive problem (vulvar discharge) but as a
medical problem (systemically ill). The most
common clinical sign is PU/PD. Pyometra
should always be ruled out in any intact female
that is ill. The bitch may not show any systemic
signs of disease, or depression, anorexia, PU/PD,
or vomiting may be observed. Clinical signs of

Clinical signs and presentation
168
Signs are based on several factors. In addition to
the victim's size, age and overall health, the
snake's age, size and overall health are important
considerations. Snakes can usually control the
amount of venom released, but often this control
is lost if the snake is frightened. Also, the fangs
be important. Additionally, the location of the
bite (168) may influence the effect. In all, the
clinical response of the victim may be the only
way to judge the severity ofthe snake bite.

Arachnids that resemble crustaceans, scorpions
 are amongst the oldest terrestrial animals, and are
found throughout the world. Many species are

Centruroides exilicanda,found in Arizona,is
known to be dangerous. Most scorpions are
nocturnal and predatory, and spend their day
under rocks, logs, floors and in crevices.
Centruroides exilicauda,also known as the bark
scorpion, is often found on or near trees.
Venom
 The last six segments of a scorpion's abdomen
form a tail-like structure, with the last segment
containing two venom glands. The toxicity of
scorpion venom varies among species, with the
more dangerous venoms causing more systemic
reactions with minimal local reactions. Like other
venoms, scorpion venom contains enzymes that
cause hemolysis, and others that act as neuro-
toxins. Centrwroides exilicanda contains a neuro-
toxin.

Hypothemia is defined as a core body tempera-
ture <37.5°C (<99.5°F). Hypothermia may be a
sign of systemic illness, as a result ofinability to
maintain the basal metabolic rate, or result from
exposure to low environmental temperature.
ETIOLOGY
Severe hypothermia results from exposure to
low environmental temperature, such as occurs
when an animal is accidentally left outside
during extremely cold weather or a fall through
ofice. Animals with poor perfusion, such as may
accompany CHF, may be hypothermic. Addi-
tionally, neonates are often unable to thermo-
regulate and may rapidly develop hypothermia
(172). Hypothermia may be protective, as
oxygen consumption is reduced.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Mild hypothermia, a core temperature between
35°C and 37.5°C (95°F and 99.5°F), can result
from sedation, anesthesia, or short-term expo-

more, on a per ml basis, Oxyglobin is significantly

Much ofthe controversy regarding the use of
colloids versus crystalloids stems from the fact
that while there are many theoretical advantages
of colloids, there is a lack of convincing evidence
that their use results in improved outcome. In
fact, there is some evidence that colloids may be
harmful in certain circumstances.Despite this
controversy, colloids are commonly used for
shock resuscitation, and in patients with low
plasma proteins and low COP. The continual
decrease in plasma COP can result in the devel-
 Opment of peripheral ederma and even persistent
hypovolemia.
Another major categorization strategy is to
distinguish fluids by their therapeutic intent:
replacement versus maintenance. Fluids usually
used for rehydration and shock resuscitation
(crystalloids and colloids) contain electrolyte
concentrations similar to normal plasma concen-
trations and are referred to as ^replacement
fluids'. Patients requiring replacement of daily
sensible and insensible water and electrolyte losses
 alone are given *maintenance fluids', which typi-
cally contain half of the sodium content of
plasma. Because these fluids are hypotonic
compared with normal plasma, dextrose is added
at a 2.5% concentration, restoring the tonicity to
 normal. As the animal metabolizes the dextrose,
these fluids essentially deliver a greater amount of
free water. Animals with true free water deficits
(e.g. a polyuric, polydipsic animal denied access
to water), will usually require a combination of
replacement and maintenance fluid therapies.
Fluids with supraphysiological concentrations
of electrolyes (7% saline) or other osmotically
active particles(20% mannitol, 50% dextrose) are
referred to as hypertonic solutions. The high
concentration of osmotically active particles also
imparts a high osmotic pressure and drives fluid
shifts from the intracellular and interstitial

such high volumes merit clinical monitoring of

Administering fluid therapy to dehydrated
animals is not limited to a specific fluid dose and
must be titrated to the individual. Daily mainte-
nance fluid requirements of normal animals are
commonly estimated as 40-60ml/kg/day.
A common practice is simply to multiply this
‘daily fluid requirement” by a multiplier, e.g.
1.5-3 x maintenance fluid rates for critically ill
 patients. This is ofen not ideal and can result in

 The common blood products available for
transfusion to veterinary patients include pRBC,
FFP, FP, cryoprecipitate, fresh whole blood, and
synthetic blood substitutes, such as Oxyglobin@
COMPONENT THERAPY
Packed red blood cells
Commercial veterinary blood banks routinely
supply units of pRBC that are prepared by
extracting most of the plasma and its associated
clotting factors. The resultant product contains
red blood cells and a small amount of plasma and
anticoagulant. A full unit of canine pRBC is
approximately 200-250ml, and contains the
same oxygen-carrying capacity as l unit of whole
blood (450ml). Because pRBC contains only a
small amount of plasma proteins, its COP is
approximately 5 mmHg. This relatively low COP,
compared with that of whole blood (20 mmHg),
 makes pRBC a reasonable choice for transfusing
anemic, normovolemic animals (e.g. dogs with
hemolytic anemia, nonregenerative anemia). The
recommended dosages for transfusions using
 pRBC are in the range of 6-10ml/kg.
Some commercial veterinary blood banks are
 now supplying feline units of pRBC. The typical
feline unit of pRBC contains 30-35 ml. Cats with
a limited capacity to tolerate large volumes of
fuids (e.g. cats with heart disease) but in need of
transfision may benefit from the administration
of pRBC rather than whole blood.

Parenteral nutrition 251

Parenteral nutrition
Parenteral nutrition is more expensive than
enteral nutrition and is only for in-hospital use.
 Indications for parenteral nutrition include
vomiting, acute pancreatitis, severe malabsorptive
disorders, and severe ileus. While terminology of
parenteral nutrition can be confusing there are
two major types. TPN is typically delivered via a
 central venous (jugular) catheter and provides
all of the energy requirements of the patient.
With PPN only a portion of the animal's energy
requirements are met (40-70%) but, because of
the lower osmolarity of the solution, they can
187
usually be administered through a large periph-
eral vein such as the lateral saphenous vein in dogs
and femoral vein in cats. Because PPN only
provides a portion of the patient's requirements,
it is only intended for short-term use in a nonde-
bilitated patient with average nutritional require-
ments. Regardless ofthe exact form of parenteral
mutrition, intravenous nutrition requires a dedi-
cated catheter that is placed using aseptic tech-
nique. Long catheters composed of silicone,
polyurethane, or tetrafluoroethylene are recom-
mended for use with parenteral nutrition to
reduce the risk ofthrombophlebitis. Multi-lumen
cathethers are often recommended for parenteral
nutrition because they can remain in place for
longer periods of time than normal jugular
catheters, and they provide other ports for blood

or more complex skills.
Vascular access
INTRAVENOUS CATHETERS
Placement ofintravenous catheters is essential to
the management of critically ill or injured
animals. Large-bore, short catheters permit
more rapid fluid delivery. In most cats, a 20 ga
catheter can be successfully placed in the
cephalic vein, while in larger dogs 14 ga or 16 ga
catheters are appropriate. 188-190 depict
placement of short over-the-needle catheters,
and 191-196 illustrate long through-the-
needle catheters and their placement.

quite easy and is facilitated by leaving a longer

care should be taken during placement to avoid
inadvertent penetration of the wall.One should

allow for errors while perfecting this technique.
ARTERIAL CATHETERS
Arterial catheters are useful for directly (inva-
sively) monitoring blood pressure and for permit-
ting repeated arterial sampling. Most commonly,
in critically illdogs, a catheter will be placed in the
metatarsal (dorsal pedal) artery. Catheters may
also be placed at other sites.
199
Cats and very small dogs are often very diff-
cult to catheterize successfully. Additionally, arte-
rial catheterization is challenging, as the vessel has
a thick wall and a tendency to spasm (or vasocon-
strict) ifpuncture is not successfil. Anatomically,
the artery lies between the metatarsal bones, so if
the puncture is not accurate, there may be
burring or damage to the catheter.
An 18-24 ga catheter is used. As the mean
arterial blood pressure is usually greater than
80 mmHg, the gauge is less important than for
venous catheter placement.

Pericardiocentesis
Pericardiocentesis
218
Pericardiocentesis (218-221) can be performed
in sternal recumbency or left lateral recumbency,
but it is recommended that the procedure be perf-
ormed from the right side ofthe thorax to reduce
the risk of coronary artery laceration. If possible,
a complete echocardiogram should be performed
before pericardiocentesis as the pericardial fluid
may help to highlight any mass lesions. The right
side of the thorax is clipped and aseptically
prepared. A continuous ECG is monitored for
arrhythmia as ventricular ectopy is common. Lido-
caine (2 mg/kg) may be prepared in the event of
219
hemodynamically significant ventricular ectopy.
Echocardiography is useful to identify a good
window for the tap, but, alternatively, a successful
tap can be performed by selecting the fourth or
 e   
between the stemum and the costochondral junc-
tion. Local anesthesia is usually adequate, though
sedation may be used if needed. Oxymorphone
should be avoided due to the tendency of dogs to
 pant following administration.

anesthesia is infused.
219 The site is palpated. A small nick in the skin
with a #ll blade may be made.In large dogs, a
5.25 inch 14 or I6 gauge catheter is used,while
in smaller dogs a 2" 18 gauge catheter is typically
adequate.
220 Fluid is carefully withdrawn while
simultaneously monitoring the EKG.lf arrhythmia
is detected, the catheter should be retracted 0.25
to I cm.lIf severe ectopy occurs, the catheter
should be withdrawn and lidocaine administered.
221
The effusion frequently has a hemorrhagic"port 
wine" appearance.In some cases,a clear or
serosanguineous pleural effusion is encountered
first. In most dogs, a significant decline in heart 
rate occurs during the procedure, which is a sign
of resolution of the tamponade.
221 Echocardiography maybe used to confirm
that the pericardial sac has been emptied.
Following pericardiocentesis serial monitoring is
advisable to watch for ongoing bleeding into the
thorax, recurrent pericardial effusion, or the
development of cardiac arrhythmias.

wise potent medications. The following exam-
ples illustrate how CRIs may be easily
formulated.
 In order to calculate a CRI, the following vari-
ables must be known:
+Desired infusion rate. This is usually in the
order of μg/kg/min. Some drugs are listed
as mg/kg/hr or mg/kg/day. Some of the
 more frequently used drugs are listed in
Table 60.
●The concentration of the drug. For drugs
 listed in percentages, multiplying the
 percentage by a factor of l0 yields the
mg/ml concentration. For example, 2% 
lidocaine is 20mg/ml.
+ The desired fluid rate. For animals in
heart failure, low rates of fluid should be
used (one eighth to one quarter of
maintenance needs). For other animals,
the drug may be added to their hourly
fluid, or infused as a separate infusion at a
