INTERPRETATION
NORMAL FINDINGS OR RANGE
● Interpretation will vary depending on the type of monitor (Holter vs
event).
● The normal canine heart rate on a Holter monitor can range from
29 to 240 beats/min with an average rate of 52-86 beats/min. Periods
of sinus arrhythmia are common. Occasional second-degree AV block,
rare VPCs, and atrial premature complexes in geriatric animals can be
normal variants. In most breeds, <25 VPCs in 24 h can be normal. In
 boxers, normal variation may be as high as 100 VPCs in 24 h.
● The normal feline heart rate on a Holter monitor has been reported
to range from 68 to 294 beats/min, with an average heart rate of
114-202 beats/min. Periods of sinus arrhythmia are noted in most

● The following discussion about individual joints is presented in
order of increasing difficulty:
Carpal Joint

bones, and the carpal and metacarpal bones.
· With the hand you are not using for aspiration, Hex the joint to
achieve a maximum amount of open joint space. The most common
joint space to be tapped is the radiocarpal joint. The larger the space,
the easier it is to obtain a good sample.
● Holding the syringe, insert the needle from the cranial surface
through the skin and joint capsule and into the joint space. Avoid the
 prominent accessory cephalic vein on the dorsal surface.
Stiffle Joint
● This is large and may be approached from either the medial or
lateral aspect.
●Flex the stife joint to open the joint space.
● Insert the needle from the cranial aspect, lateral or medial to the
patellarligament. The needle should enter the joint approximately
halfway between the patella and tibial tuberosity.
● Angle the needle toward the center of the joint. It may be helpful to

Tarsal Joint
·Two small joint spaces can be tapped in the tarsus.
One approach is to fex the joint slightly and palpate the cranial
space between the tibia and tibiotarsal bone. Insert the needle from the
cranial and lateral aspect and direct it medially. This joint is shallow, so
you will not need to advance the needle very far.
 The second approach is from the distal aspect and is accomplished
by fexing the tarsal joint more fully to open the space between the dis-
tal fibula, tibia, and calcaneus bones. Palpate this space and insert the
needle from a caudolateral position. The needle should be advanced
 parallel to calcaneus distally and slightly medially.
Elbow
● Flex the elbow to an ^45° angle. This opens the space between the
humerus and the ulna.
● Insert the needle between the olecranon process and the lateral

● A percutaneous (Seldinger) catheter introducer system is often pre-
ferred for ascularaccess to thejugularvein,femoral artery or fmral
vein. The vessel is located via digital palpation, and a vascular cannula
with stylet or an 18-gauge thin-walled needle is inserted into the vessel.
The stylet is removed, and a fexible guidewire is inserted through the
cannula or needle into the vessel. The needle is removed, leaving the
wire in place. An end-hole catheter, with or without vascular dilator,
is then threaded over the guidewire into the vessel, the guidewire and
vascular dilator are removed, and the catheter is fushed with saline.

balloon-tip catheters (Berman angiographic or balloon wedge) facilitate
catheter placement into the RV and pulmonary artery (PA). Pigtail
catheters minimize trauma and enable easier passage through the aortic
valve. Catheters that are used for dogs and cats usually range in size
from 4 to 8 French outside diameter and from 50 to 120 cm long. The
largest catheter that can be easily inserted and manipulated is usually
 preferred, especially if angiographic studies are planned.
 For pressure measurement, the catheter is advanced into the desired
chamber or vessel and is connected to pressure tubing, which is con-
nected to a pressure transducer and calibrated physiologic recorder.

and positive contrast studies are the procedures of choice for detecting

Intralumina!
Objects occupying space in the lumen are referred to as filling defets
because they usually cause areas of no or incomplete filling (black
holes) by iodinated contrast medium with either double-contrast or
 positive contrast cystourethrographic techniques. These filling defects
are defined as free (i.e., they move with gravity to the deepest point of
the bladder [often the geographic center on recumbent views] or move
with contrast injection. Free intraluminal filling defects can be uroliths,
blood clots, bubbles {which usually migrate to the periphery of the
contrast pool on double-contrast studies), matrix plugs, sloughed
mucosa {ulcerative cystitis), or fragments of tumor. By comparison,
attached filling defects maintain a more or less fixed relationship
with a region of the mucosal surface and do not move with gravity
or contrast-medium How. Attached flling defects are usually tumors
(sessile) or infammatory or neoplastic polyps (pedunculated) but can
be hematomas or scars. Masses of any sort found primarily in the blad-
der trigone are most likely neoplastic. Be aware that positive contrast
medium in more diluted mixtures than that defined above can mask
struvite or oxalate uroliths, depending on the iodine concentration.
Also, always check kidney status with trigonal mases (hydronephr-
sis). Urethral flling defects are judged by shape: Smooth with contours
following the lumen are probably bubbles, irregular and focal filling
defects are probably uroliths, and regional luminal or mural irregular-
ities are usually tumors, but beware of postrauma scarring, stricture
 formation, and pyogranulomatous urethritis. Always confirm findings
with cytology or histology.
Extramura!
A partially distended bladder can be distorted easily by regional organs
       r     s 
luminal distortions are indeed caused by regional infuences instead of
intramural disease. If there is a doubt, different positioning or more
distention is indicated to minimize equivocation.
Remember
Contrast cystography is very useful for identifying bladder location
(retrofexion,hernia)and for distinguishing the bladder from other
caudal abdominal Huid-flled cavities defined by ultrasound, such as
paraprostatic cysts, segmental uterine fuid distention, and intersex
anomalies.

TYPE OF PROCEDURE
Radiographic
T'he osseous structures surrounding teeth (i.e., alveolar bone) and
jaws (i.e., mandibles, maxillae) frequently need evaluation for various
pathologic conditions. Intraoral radiographs provide additional infor-

 neoplastic, traumatic) to enable practitioners to decide on appropriate
therapy.

Tooth Resorption (Primarily Cats)
● Evaluate distinctions between tooth, periodontal ligament space, and

● In true odontoclastic lesions, often the root structure is difficult
to distinguish from surrounding bone, and no distinct periodontal
ligament space is visible (Figure 10).
● In some cases where periodontal disease and attachment loss (i.e.,
gingiva, bone) have exposed roots, there can be resorption, but the
remaining root structure is intact, distinguishable from surrounding
bone, and even separated from it by an intact periodontal ligament
space.

NEUROGRAPHY
● Most neuropathies produce a combination of changes in NCV

pathology.

 ing undulations) indicates demyelination.
CRITICAL VALUES

INTERFERING FACTORS
Drugs That May Alter Resuits of the Procedure
 Neuromuscular blockade, if induced under anesthesia, will prevent a
CMAP from being elicited.
Conditions That May Interfere with Performing the Procedure
Other than diseases that contraindicate anesthesia, no conditions
interfere with performing nerve conduction studies specifically.
Procedure Techniques or Handling That May Alter Results
● Temperature affects NCV: A 1°C limb temperature reduetion
decreases NCV by a factor of 1.7-1.8 m/s.
● Severe muscle atrophy can make it difficult to record a CMAP from 
the interosseous muscles. This does not necessarily indicate abnor-
mal nerve function, and recordings from a larger muscle should be
attempted.

 and typically performed by a neurologist.

NORMAL FINDINGS OR RANGE
After completion of IV contrast-medium administration, normal

(nephrogram) within 15-20 s that progressively fades toward that seen
on the survey radiographs during the 40-min sequence of postinjection
radiographs. Renal length measurements (from the VD view) for dogs
should be between 2.5 and 3.5 times the length of the second lumbar
vertebral body, and for cats they should be between 1.9 and 3.2 times
 the length of the second vertebral body. Peak symmetrical renal pelvic

 INTERPRETATION
NORMAL FINDINGS OR RANGE
● Dogs: The liver has a uniform echogenicity and is hypoechoic in
the renal cortex (Figure 1). The echotexture is coarse compared to the
spleen.
 Cats: The liver has uniform echogenicity and is hypoechoic to the
adjacent falciform fat. It may become hyperechoic to the surrounding
fat in obese but otherwise healthy cats.
● A mirror-image artifact is often present on the thoracic side of the
diaphragm.

in the sonographic appearance of different infammatory and neoplas-
tic diseases, either fne-needle aspiration for cytologic evaluation or
Tru-cut biopsy for histopathologic evaluation is required for a more
definitive diagnosis.
Hepatomegaly
● Because only extreme alterations in liver size are readily recognizable
with ultrasound, the size should be determined in combination with
radiography.
● Hepatomegaly can be suspected when the distance between the
diaphragm and stomach is increased, the liver lobes are extended
 caudally, and the liver margins are rounded.
● Common causes include hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus,
acute hepatitis, hepatic venous congestion, and neoplasia.
Microbepatica
● Suspected when there is poor visualization of the liver or close ap-

TEST EXPLANATION AND RELATED PHYSIOLOGY
Cortisol is the major glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. The
 synthesis and secretion of cortisol are stimulated by ACT'H released
from the pituitary gland. ACTH is regulated by CRH from the hy-
pothalamus. Inturn, rising levels of cortisol suppress secretion of both

TES
● Lung mechanics. For a more in-depth assessment of breathing me-
chanics, one must obtain information on the transpulmonary pressure
changes occurring in conjunction with the fow and volume mea-
surements. Accordingly, one can then calculate lung resistance (RL),
which is defined by the change in transpulmonary pressure occurring
for a corresponding change in airfow. Increased R, measurements
are indicative of central with/or without peripheral airway constriction
or obstruction. Alternatively, by measuring the volume of air trans-
ported in and/or out of the lung by a given change in pressure, one
can assess Cyn. Decreased Cpyn measurements refect that the lung
is stiffer than normal, possibly owing to extensive, small-airway con-
striction or, alternatively, development of diffuse infltrative disease
(e.g, pulmonary edema, pulmonary fibrosis). These measurements
have been used to characterize cats with bronchopulmonary disease,
specifically to establish (1) the degree of airway obstruction present;
(2) the reversibility of the obstruction, if present; and (3) the degree of
underlying nonspecifc airway responsiveness present.

TEST EXPLANATION AND RELATED PHYSIOLOGY
The assay for measurement of trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI)
in serum is a species-specific immunoassay used to diagnose exocrine
pancreatic insufficiency (EPl). The test primarily measures sypsinogen,
