PREFACE
This book provides representative examples of hematology and cytology cases encountered in exotic animal
practice. Cases in the book were selected based on the important role of cytodiagnosis or hematology in the
cytodiagnostic interpretations.
Cases representing animals with anemia include blood loss, hemolytic, iron deficiency, Heinz body, and

Mammalian Hematology Case Studies
A 6-Year-Old Otter Undergoing a Routine Physical
Examination
Signalment
A 6-year-old intact North American male river otter (Lontra canadensis) was examined as part of a routine
physical examination.
History
The patient was housed with two other male otters of the same age. No significant health problems had been
observed in any of the otters. The otters were weighed weekly, and there had been no change in the appetite,
behavior, or weight.
Physical Examination Findings

Other Diagnostic Information
A fecal occult blood was positive; however, no red blood cells or other abnormalities were seen on a fecal
cytology.
Whole body ventral-dorsal and lateral radiographs revealed no abnormalities in the abdominal organs. The T14-
L1 intervertebral disk space was narrowed with sclerotic end plates and was indicative of spondylosis deformans.

Interpretive Discussion
Figures 1.3 and 1.4 reveal erythrocyte abnormalities. Many of the erythrocytes are hypochromatic as indicated
erythrocytes (blister cells) appear to be developing vacuoles or blisters that enlarge. These blisters eventually
break open to form "apple stem cells" and keratocytes. Spiculated erythrocytes (those with more than two pointed 
The packed cell volume (PCv), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV), and mean cell
hemoglobin concentration (McHC) on the hemogram are decreased, which is indicative of an iron-deficiency
anemia. The appearance of microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes on the blood film is also indicative of an iron-

fecal occult blood is suggestive of gastrointestinal blood loss in this patient; however, the two healthy otters that
share his habitat also exhibited positive fecal occult blood tests. Thus, it is likely that the results of the fecal occult
blood testing are false-positive owing to the meat diet of the otters. The endoscopic examination suggested the
possibility of blood being lost from the upper gastrointestinal tract as would be seen with Helicobacter
involvement; however, histologic examination of biopsy samples failed to confirm pathology associated with that
area (Table 1.3).

On day 1, the ferret appears to be exhibiting a stress leukogram; however, considering the geriatric status of
the low PCV, RBC, and hemoglobin concentration. The cause of the anemia is likely in part related to blood loss in
the gastrointestinal tract as indicated by melena. The refractometric plasma protein is low, which supports blood

A 6-Year-Old Ferret with Anorexia and Lethargy
Signalment
A 6-year-old female ferret (Mustela putorius furo) was presented for anorexia and lethargy.
History
this period and reported that the ferret has been sleeping more than usual. The owner did observe that although
her stool production was less than normal, it appeared dark. During the past year, the ferret has been given oral
melatonin for suspected adrenal disease. The ferret was normally fed a diet of kibbled ferret food.
Physical Examination Findings
The ferret was thin (body score of 3/9) and weighed 500 g. She was lethargic and at least 10% dehydrated. She was

neoplasia cannot be entirely ruled out. Repeat imaging with computed radiography would be recommended to try
to further evaluate these caudal dorsal lung lobes. The appearance of the loss of serosal detail in the abdomen
could be the result of poor body condition score, although peritoneal effusion or carci-nomatosis cannot be
recommended, but declined by the client owing to the cost of the procedure.

Neutrophil concentrations are generally higher than lymphocyte concentrations in normal ferrets and they tend
to increase in concentration, while lymphocytes decrease in concentration with increasing age. The total leukocyte
count of healthy ferrets can be as low as 3,0o0/|xl; therefore, ferrets are unable to develop a marked leukocytosis
with inflammatory disease, and concentrations greater than 20,0o0/|xl are unusual and a left shift is rare. In this

0.4-0.6 mg/dL with a range of 0.2-0.9 mg/dl. As a result, a moderate increase in the plasma creatinine
concentration (i.e., 1-2 mg/dl) in a ferret is significant and suggestive of renal disease. This, however, is not an
issue in thiscase.
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, which appears elevated in this case, is a sensitive and specific test for
aminotransferase (AST) activity as well. Those with cholestasis likely have increased plasma alkaline phos-phatase

The hypophosphatemia is likely related to a dietary deficiency or intestinal malabsorption of phosphorus. Other
formed or renal tubular phosphate re-absorption are also possible. Alkaline phosphatase is synthesized by the
liver, osteoblasts, intestinal epithelium, and renal epithelium; however, the normal alkaline phosphatase activity in
the blood of domestic carnivores originates from hepatocytes. Increases in this activity in these animals can occur
with cholestasis, osteoblastic activity, and a variety of neoplasms.

A 3-Year-Old Rabbit with Anorexia
Signalment
A 3-year-old intact female domestic rabbit (Orycto-fagus cuniculus) was presented for anorexia.
History
fruit (kale, carrots, apple, banana), and a small amount of alfalfa hay given twice weekly. She also received two to
three treats daily. She lived with another intact female rabbit in the house, and the owners reported that she was
exhibiting increased nesting behavior. According to the client, there were no changes in the home that may have
dry, scant feces and was drinking less water than usual.
Physical Examination Findings
On physical examination, the rabbit was bright, alert, and responsive and weighed 2.25 kg. The abdomen was
distended and firm. The feces were small, dry, and scant. The heart rate was greater than 200 beats/minute and
Blood was collected from the left saphenous vein for a complete blood count and diagnostic profile (Tables 5.1
and 5.2 and Figs. 5.1a-5.1dj.
Other Diagnostic Information
Radiographs were taken (Figs. 5.2 and 5.3).
The radiographs revealed multiple 3-5 mm in length, smoothly marginated, mineral opaque calculi located in
the urinary bladder. There was also an 11 mm in length, oblong, smoothly marginated, mineralized structure
located in the fat within the left inguinal region. There was a large amount of fat identified within the midventral
abdomen, likely within the broad ligament of the uterus. There was also an ill-defined oblong soft tissue opacity

The interpretation of the radiographs included multiple cystic calculi and multifocal right renal mineralization

Interpretive Discussion
Figure 5.1a shows two heterophils and a basophil. The echinocytes are likely an artifact associated with crenation;
however, they have been associated with renal disease and lymphoma in dogs (Thrall, 2004). Figure 5.1b shows
monocytes. Figure 5.1d shows a het-erophil and a giant platelet. The platelets in the background of the images
indicate that there is an adequate number.
The hemogram indicates a mild leukocytosis that could be associated with a physiological leukocytosis

The plasma biochemical profile shows hyper-glycemia that is likely associated with a stress response and
increased corticosteroid release. The high calcium concentration is a common finding in rabbits, especially those
with high calcium content in their diet (i.e., alfalfa pellets) as rabbits are highly efficient in extracting calcium from
rabbit's rapid breathing. The low bicarbonate concentration is also associated with an apparent increase in the

however, is likely to be different in the healthy rabbit. A blood gas evaluation is required to better evaluate the
acid-base status of this rabbit.
Summary
The rabbit underwent general anesthesia for a cys-totomy and ovariohysterectomy. The rabbit was given
cutaneously for preanesthetic medications 30 minutes before induction. For induction, she was given ketamine
(11.3 mg) and midazolam (0.63 mg) intravenously. Intubation of rabbits is often difficult because of the angle of
the pharynx and lack of visualization of the larynx. Intubation of this rabbit proved to be more difficult than
expected, but was successful after several attempts.

The yellow urinary component of the droppings found on physical examination could represent biliru-binuria,
 Suggestive of either hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Because birds lack biliverdin reductase enzyme in their
caused by post-hepatic reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin by other enzymes.
The plasma biochemistry panel revealed a mildly elevated aspartate
eaminotransferase (AST), which is
suggestive of hepatocellular disease; however, this enzyme is not specific for the liver. It is also possible that the
elevated AsT has resulted from the previous skeletal muscle injury or exertion that has yet to return to normal.
The diagnostic testing that may have provided further evidence for hepatobiliary disease that included whole body
radiographs, ultrasound, plasma bile acid concentration, and liver biopsy was offered but declined by the client.
The hypophosphatemia is likely the result of poor dietary intake of phosphorus. The hyperproteinemia could be
explained by hemoconcentration or inflammation.
protein and globulins likely result from an inflammatory response. A protein electrophoresis that was offered but
declined by the client would have added to the understanding of the increased total protein.
Although the packed cell volume (Pcv) on day 1 is normal when compared to published values for chickens, this
bird would be considered to be moderately anemic when compared to many other species of birds where a PCV
less that 35% is generally considered to be low.

Histology revealed that the lumen of the oviduct was filled with abundant macrophages, heterophils, and 
necrotic debris. The mucosal epithelium was intact and the lamina propria contained a moderately increased
population of lymphocytes and plasma cells. At the serosal surface, there was accumulation of fibrin, mixed 
inflammatory cells, and necrotic debris. Histology of the egg revealed necrosis and chronic inflammation with in-
tralesional bacterial colonies. These histologic findings were consistent with a severe chronic-active salpingitis and
serositis associated with an ectopic egg.

A 14-Year-Old Parrot with Weakness, Anorexia, and
Labored Breathing
Signalment
A 14-year-old female Quaker parrot (Myiopsitta monachus) was presented for weakness, anorexia, and labored
breathing (Fig. 12.1).

A 2-Year-Old Tragopan with Wounds
Signalment
A 2-year-old male Satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra), a type of pheasant, was presented with wounds on his back.
History
The tragopan was housed in a free-flight aviary with a female tragopan and domestic geese. The birds were fed a
commercial diet for game birds supplemented with a variety of fruits. The bird received wounds from an unknown
attacker 5 days prior to presentation. He had been treated for 5 days with a systemic antibiotic (en-rofloxacin) and
a topical antibiotic (nitrofurazone). The tragopan was presented because his overall condition had deteriorated to
the point that he no longer was able to walk during the past 24 hours.
Physical Examination Findings
The 2.65 kg bird was presented with three large open necrotic wounds on his back. The bird was markedly
depressed and unable or unwilling to stand. Blood was collected by venipuncture of the medial metatarsal vein for
a blood profile (Tables 15.1 and 15.2 and Figs. 15.1a and 15.1b).
Interpretive Discussion
The hemogram revealed a marked leukocytosis with a marked heterophilia, lymphopenia, and monocytosis.
Figures 15.1a and 15.1b reveal the morphology of the heterophils in the blood film. The heterophils exhibit deep
cytoplasmic basophilia, reduction of the number of rod-shaped eosinophilic granules, and cytoplasmic
vacuolization; these are features of toxic heterophils. The bird has a severe inflammatory leukogram.

Interpretive Discussion
The hemogram reveals a marked leukocytosis with a heterophilia and monocytosis. The bird is considered to be
anemic based on reference values for Mallard ducks during the winter and that most birds have a normal packed
having a refractometric total protein ranging between 3.5 and 5.5 g/dL. This value is either increased because of
dehydration, as noted on the physical examination findings, or the bird has hyperproteinemia associated with a
hyperglobulinemia as part of the inflammatory response.

The necropsy revealed a granular to fibrinous, slightly firm (0.4 cm x 0.2 cm x 0.2 cm), brown/gray mass at the
tracheal-syrinx interface occupying approximately 30% of the lumen. Histopathologic examination revealed an
ulcerated, pedunculated, round mass composed of a thick layer of degenerate polymorphonuclear and
numbers of dimorphic parallel-walled hyphae that have frequent septae and regular branching consistent with
those of Aspergillus spp. Underlying the serocellular crusts of the mass, there was a short stalk composed of
marked pyogranulomatous inflammation within a highly vascular fibrous stroma that extended transmurally
also had mild to moderate subepithelial expansion by pyogranulomatous inflammation. All other organs, except
for diffuse congestion of the lungs, were within normal limits grossly.

The bird was fed Coturnix quail (Coturnix coturnix); however, during the past week, the bird required hand
feeding bits of quail. The client was concerned that the falcon had a sour crop as regurgitated quail parts were
found in the mews overnight. According to the client, the bird had lost weight. She normally weighed 850 g;
however, when he weighed her prior to presentation, she weighed 710 g.
Physical Examination Findings
The 720 g falcon exhibited generalized weakness and required leaning on her handler for stability. It was noted
that the bird drooped her wings and had a prominent keel on palpation, indicating significant weight loss. A
 A blood sample was obtained via venipuncture of the basilic vein for a blood profile (Iables 19.1 and 19.2 and

A blood sample was obtained via venipuncture of the basilic vein for a blood profile. Blood was also submitted
for blood lead concentration. A fecal smear was obtained for cytology. Before obtaining whole body radiographs to
search for any metallic objects (i.e., gun shot) in the gastrointestinal tract, an attempt was made to remove the
material from the crop. The hawk managed to regurgitate a necrotic pigeon breast muscle during an attempt to
pass a feeding tube (Tables 20.1 and 20.2 and Figs. 20.3-20.7).

The yellow urate component of the mute is indicative of bile pigment in the urine (Fig. 20.2). Biliverdin, a green 
pigment, is generally considered to be the primary bile pigment in birds as these animals lack the hepatic biliverdin

The turtle died the following day. It is likely that she died from hepatic lipidosis and other complications that
occur with prolonged reduction of food intake owing to the space occupying eggs in the coelomic cavity that
impact on the amount of food the turtle could actually take in. Also, although no necropsy was performed, it is
likely that the retained eggs caused a salpingitis that may have gone systemically based on the presence of the

A 35-Year-Old Tortoise with Anorexia, Lethargy, and
Constipation
Signalment
A 35-year-old male desert tortoise (Gopherus agas-sizii)was presented with a 3-week history of anorexia,
lethargy, and constipation.
History
The client had owned the tortoise for 25 years and reported no previous medical problems. Her veterinarian
referred her to an exotic animal veterinary specialist who obtained blood for a complete blood count and
diagnostic profile (see day 1 profile results) as well as whole body radiographs (see Figs. 25.1a and 25.1b). It was
noted that the captive husbandry had been subopti-mal, with a diet rich in vegetable proteins instead of the
roughage necessary to maintain urinary and gastrointestinal tract health in a desert tortoise. It was also noted that

The radiograph (Fig. 26.1) showed the right rear limb with luxation of the stifle. The long bones of that limb appear
to be intact. There was also a small pelvic fracture on the right side noted by the radiologist that is difficult to

move from halfway across the country. Since then the colony had lost three rats. An older female and her 11/2-

Summary
trichomonad infections. A moisturizing cream was applied daily to the skin of the rat to combat the dry skin that
often affects animals that have recently moved from a humid environment to an arid or semiarid one. One drop of
a triple antibiotic solution containing a corticosteroid was applied in the left eye twice daily for 10 days to treat the
conjunctivitis. After 5 days, the trichomonad infection was completely eliminated in all the rats and they no longer
had diarrhea. The male rat's skin and conjunctiva appeared normal after treatment.

maintained on isoflurane anesthesia after intubation (size 20 endotra-cheal tube) (Tables 33.1 and 33.2)
Yellow, hazy urine was obtained by cystocentesis. A urinalysis revealed a pH of 5.0 with a 2+ blood on the test
strip. The urine was negative for protein, sulfosali-cylic acid protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, bacteria, fat, and
crystals. The specific gravity was 1.016.
Blood gas evaluation following anesthetic induction revealed a pH of 7.281, pCO2 of 56, an HC03 of 25.5, and
an anion gap of 14. The ionized calcium was 1.5.
The lateral abdominal radiograph suggested focal  loss of serosal detail within the mid-abdomen.
Gastrointestinal structures, kidneys, urinary bladder, and liver appeared within normal limits. The focal loss of
serosal detail may be due to superimposition of structures or focal loss of detail as would be seen with small-
volume peritoneal effusion or peritonitis.

A 5%-Year-Old Ferret Presented for a Presurgical
Evaluation
Signalment
A 51/2-year-old castrated male ferret (Musteia puto-riusfuro) was examined for presurgical workup for an
exploratory surgery and ad renalectomy.
History
This animal, a blood donor for a veterinary hospital, was housed with one other castrated male ferret. A right
adrenalectomy and a partial pancreatectomy were performed 1 year earlier. Alopecia had recurred and was first 
noted 1 month prior to presentation. There were no other clinical signs, and the ferret appeared healthy with a

Physical Examination Findings
A 2 cm ulcerated mass was found on the ventral mid-tail on an otherwise healthy ferret (Fig. 35.1). A fine-needle
aspirate of the mass was obtained for further evaluation (Figs. 35.2a-35.2c).
Eig. 35.1. Thefe rretwith atailmass.
Other Diagnostic Information
Interpretive Discussion
The cytologic examination of the fine-needle aspirate of the mass revealed a marked inflammatory response
characterized by nondegenerate neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 35.2a). The cytologic examination also reveals
several clusters of large epithelial cells (Figs. 35.2b and 35.2c). These cells exhibit a moderate anisocytosis and
also many binucleated and multinucleated cells with large nucleoli and a coarsely granular chromatin pattern.
These findings are consistent with malignant neoplasia and more specifically, a carcinoma. It is difficult to
Neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglobu-linemia were noted on the blood profile. Neutrophilia and
hyperglobulinemia are likely due to an inflammatory response. The thrombocytopenia may be a result of clumping
as noted on the hematology report, therefore, a false decrease.
Summary
decided to remove the entire mass instead of obtaining a biopsy for histopathology. The tail was prepared for

The neoplasm was described as a poorly differentiated carcinoma, presumably an adenocarcinoma. There was
vascular invasion, so further assessment for metastatic lesions was recommended. The ferret returned 2 weeks
later for suture removal. He was doing well although he had chewed out two of the sutures. The sutures were
removed and silver sulfadiazene cream was applied to the area where he had mutilated the tip. No evidence of

This rabbit had anesthetic complications, which discouraged further anesthetic procedures. Histopathologic
examination confirmed a soft tissue sarcoma with cells along the excisional margin. It was also noted that the
several other tumors developed around the rabbit's mouth and eyes. The rabbit was kept comfortable until he
passed away approximately 6 months after surgery. No necropsy was performed.

History
The client was a successful chinchilla breeder and provided excellent husbandry for her animals. This chinchilla
had been doing fine until yesterday when the client noticed that his eyelids on his right eye were stuck closed until
she was able to free them using a commercial artificial tear solution.
Physical Examination Findings
scraping was performed for cytological examination following application of a topical ophthalmic anesthetic (Figs.
37.2a and 37.2b).
Interpretive Discussion
The conjunctival scraping was poorly cellular as demonstrated in Figs. 37.2a and 37.2b. The few cells present
are neutrophils and indicate a neutrophilic inflammation (conjunctivitis). The neutrophils of chinchillas have
polymorphic nuclei and faint acidophilic cytoplasmic granules. These should not be confused with eosinophils.
Bacteria can be seen in the background, but none were found inside the neutrophils.
Eig. 3Z.1. The 1-year-old intact male chinchilla with an inflamed right eye.
Summary
Fluorescent staining of the cornea was negative for the presence of an ulcer. A culture of the lesion identified a
pure growth of Pasteurella muitocida that was susceptible to 11 of the 12 antibiotics tested on the sensitivity
for 2 weeks. At his 2-week recheck appointment, the chinchilla's conjunctivitis completely resolved.

neoplasia involving one of the adrenal glands. Enlargement of the liver can be seen secondary to congestion,
metabolic disease, or neoplasia. The bilateral pleural effusions could be secondary to right-sided heart failure.
Cardiomyopathy cannot be ruled out. The increased opacity and enlargement of the caudal aspect of the cranial
examination were recommended for further evaluation.

eating and drinking normally and there were no other concerns.
Physical Examination Findings
The 530 g ferret appeared healthy except for the presence of a nonpainful, multipedunculated mass on the
right pinna. Blood was collected for a blood profile, which proved to be normal. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of
the mass was obtained for cytodiagnosis (Figs. 42.2aand 42.2b)

The ferret made an uneventful recovery.
Histopathologic finding of the mass revealed an expansile, neoplastic population of spindloid and his-tiocytic
cells. The neoplastic cells were 20-1-0 (xm in diameter with large ovoid nuclei, clumped chro-matin, and 
abundant, eosinophilic, finely vacuolated cytoplasm. These cells were interspersed with abundant, loose collagen
 bundles. Numerous multinucleated giant cells were also present. Superficial dermal aggregates of lymphocytes
and plasma cells were also found. Neo-plastic cells extended to, but did not cross, auricular cartilage. The

A 3-Month-Old Ferret with a Prolapsed Rectum
Signalment
A 3-month-old neutered female ferret (Mustela putorius furo) was presented with a prolapsed rectum (Fig
44.1).
History
The owner obtained the ferret when she was 5 weeks old. According to the owner, the ferret's rectum had been
prolapsed during the past 18 hours. The ferret had a history of intermediate episodes of a rectal prolapse since she
was 5 weeks of age. Lately, the ferret had been normal except for bouts of small yellow feces during the past 2
days. During the past few weeks, the owner had been offering multiple diets in an effort to change what the ferret
eats with the thought that the cause for the rectal prolapse was dietary.
Physical Examination Findings
On physical examination, the ferret was bright, alert, and responsive and her activity level was normal. Her

Abdominal palpation revealed a large mass in the right cranial abdomen. The ferret's feces were soft, yellow, and
had a "bird seed" appearance (Fig. 44.2). The feces were sampled for cytologic examination (Figs. 44.3a

A blood sample was obtained via jugular venipunc-ture for a complete blood count and plasma biochemical

The hypoalbuminemia associated with normal globulin concentration on the plasma biochemistry profile could
albumin production results from liver failure, starvation, intestinal malabsorption of amino acids, gastrointestinal
parasitism, or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Loss of albumin from the body can occur with glomerular disease
of the feces (Eig. 44.2).
Figures 44.3aand 44.3b show the presence of eosinophils in the fecal sample and support a diagnosis of
immune-mediated or hypersensitivity reaction related to the diet. Affected ferrets often produce feces with a "bird
seed" appearance that is considered to be the result of a malabsorption disorder.

The gross necropsy revealed a 2 cm x 1.5 cm exo-phytic dermal and subcuticular mass within the left inguinal
area. The mass is firm on palpation and consists of homogeneous, tan tissue with a thin, pseudocapsule on cut
section. The left testicle is enlarged approximately twice the size of the right (Fig. 46.6). The testicle is enlarged by
a poorly demarcated, off-white to yellow homogeneous mass, which resembles normal adipose tissue on cut
section. Present within the caudal aspect of the left caudal lung lobe is a well-demarcated, 2 mm in diameter mass,
which appears as off-white, homogeneous tissue on cut section. The remaining organs and structures of the
abdominal cavity are within normal limits.
Histopathologic examination of the subcuticular lesion from the inguinal region revealed a multilobulated.

History
The ferret was housed with a female ferret of the same age that presented 5 days earlier showing similar
clinical signs of pawing at the mouth. That ferret was diagnosed with having an insulinoma and hepa-tocellular
disease of unknown etiology. At the age of 4 years, this patient had an adrenalectomy to remove a left adrenal
symmetrical alopecia, signaling recurrence of adrenal disease. The client elected not to perform a second surgery
or pursue medical treatment at that time owing to financial reasons. The ferret was being treated with flutamide,

was found on the left flank area (Fig. 47.1). The skin mass was a well-delineated, reddened, lesion partially devoid
of hair with a central white area. According to the client, the mass had been present for several months. During
the examination, the ferret produced loose, semiformed feces. A sample was collected for cytodiagnosis.

with immature polychromatic erythro-cytes because their hemoglobin content is less than mature cells owing to
flutamide, which has been reported to cause methemoglobinemia in humans (Jackson et al., 1994).

Other Diagnostic Testing
A blood sample was obtained via jugular venipunc-ture and submitted for a complete blood cell count and
coelomic fluid revealed a total protein of 2.6 g/dL, 80 nucleated cells/^L, and red blood cells more than

Interpretive Discussion
The increased packed cell volume (Pcv) is possibly associated with dehydration. The low refractometric total
poproteinemia may be worse than it appears and likely to become critical when the bird becomes better hy-
drated. It is also possible that the bird has polycythemia associated with chronic hypoxia. The leukogram is

A 2-Year-Old Macaw with Left Leg Lameness
Signalment
A 2-year-old male Military macaw (Ara miitaris) was presented with left leg lameness.
History
The macaw was presented with the chief complaint of left leg lameness. A complete blood count and a plasma
biochemistry profile performed at another veterinary hospital were normal.
Physical Examination Findings
On physical examination, the macaw was bright, alert, and responsive and weighed 896 g. He was reluctant to
bear weight on his left leg, which was markedly swollen in the region of the proximal tibiotarsus.

Interpretive Discussion
The radiographs (Figs. 53.1-53.3) reveal that the proximal one-third of the left tibiatarsus is nearly completely
lytic where small amounts of the cortex remain visible. There is soft tissue swelling around the proximal tibiotarsus
malaligned on the lateral view. The distal left femur is normal. No other soft tissue or bony abnormalities are
detected. The radiographic differential diagnoses included bacterial or fungal osteomyelitis or primary bone
neoplasia.

Once the bird was stable the physical examination was completed. The bird weighed 376 g and was in good
body condition. A small amount of clear discharge was observed in both nares.
Other Diagnostic Information during Initial Visit
Radiographs revealed no significant findings and the lungs and air sacs appeared normal. Considering the bird's
surgery of the syrinx was performed.

arthroscope (1.9 mm) was used to better visualize the entire trachea and syrinx. A small, white, plaque was
identified and removed from the ventral syrinx. An impression of the sample was taken for cytologic examination
(Eigs. 55.2 and 55.3) and the remainder of the sample was submitted for culture and sensitivity. The trachea and
subcutaneous tissue were closed with a 5-0 glycomer 631 suture separately, and the skin was closed with 4-0

The hemogram indicates a mild leukopenia; however, the presence on toxic heterophils in the peripheral blood
film indicates a severe inflammatory response regardless of the actual cell count. This is likely a response to the

crop, proventriculus, ventriculus, and intestinal structures. There is an irregularly marginated focal region of
contrast material within the tissues adjacent to the left scapulohumeral joint. The focal accumulation of contrast
within the pharyngeal region may represent reflux. The contrast adjacent to the left scapulohumeral joint is
suggestive of subcutaneous accumulation. An esophageal or crop perforation leading to this accumulation is

The radiographs show increased soft-tissue opacity within the mid to caudal aspects of the coelomic cavity. This
opacity likely caused the mass effect with resultant caudal and ventral bowing of the caudoventral body wall,
prominence of the vent, and slight craniad displacement of the ventriculus. On the ventral-dorsal radiograph, there

Interpretive Discussion 2
The cytologic examination of the surface of the cloacal mass (Eig. 62.6) shows an inflammatory response that
consists primarily of nondegenerate heterophils with macrophages, erythrocytes, and a lymphocyte. This is
indicative of an inflammatory response and no indication for neoplasia.

Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture for a blood profile while the bird was placed under isoflurane
anesthesia via face mask for whole body radiograph evaluations. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an in-
tracoelomic mass was obtained for cytodiagnosis. The sample appeared clear and greasy when placed on the
microscope slides (Figs. 63.1-63.5 and Iables 63.1 and 63.2).
Interpretive Discussion
The initial whole body radiographs (Figs. 63.2a and 63.3a) reveal a large soft-tissue opaque mass in the caudal
dorsal aspect of the coelomic cavity, causing cranial and ventral displacement of the coelomic structures. This
likely represents a neoplastic mass arising from the reproductive tract. There appears to be a marked enlargement
of the hepatic silhouette, extending beyond the margins of the coxofemoral joint on the ven-trodorsal view. The

An Adult Duck with a Mass on the Rhinotheca
Signalment
An adult male white-winged wood duck (Cairina scutulata) was presented with a mass on the rhinotheca (Fig.
64.1).
History
The duck was a member of a large group of waterfowl housed in a public zoological park. This species of duck is
highly endangered, and this drake was part of the breeding program. The duck was housed in a large wetlands
considerably in size since then, according to the keeper.
Eig. 64.1. The mass on the rhinotheca of the duck.
Physical Examination Findings
The duck appeared to be in good condition. The only abnormality found was a large, firm, painless mass on the
rhinotheca, growing throughout the entire thickness of that structure. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was
(Tables 64.1 and 64.2 and Figs. 64.2 and 64.3).

A blood sample was obtained from the caudal vein using the lateral approach on the tail. The sample was
submitted for a blood profile (Iables 66.1 and 66.2).
Interpretive Discussion
The cytologic sample from the oral swab is highly cellular and consists primarily of heterophils indicating a severe
heterophilic inflammation. Figure 66.2 reveals a heterophil exhibiting bacterial phagocytosis and supports the
cytodiagnosis of septic heterophilic inflammation and stomatitis.
Figure 66.3 reveals a monocyte (large cell on the left), two lymphocytes, and two intact heterophils. A broken
heterophil is located in the lower right. The het-erophils have a slightly basophilic cytoplasm. It should be noted

A 3-Year-Old Lizard with Vomiting and Weight Loss
Signalment
A 3-year-old female leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) was presented for vomiting and weight loss.
History
noted that she had not defecated for 2 days. She laid one egg 1 month ago and, according to the owner, had not
been the same since then. Because the gecko was acquired only 6 months prior to presentation, any previous

Physical Examination Findings
The lizard was quiet, yet responsive, and weighed 50 g. She was very thin as denoted by the severe decrease in tail
mass (Eig. 67.1). Her coelomic cavity palpated normal. There was a small white mass noticed on the cornea of her
eyes. A scraping of this mass was collected (Fig. 67.2) for cytodiagnosis.

These findings are likely associated with the ulcerative nature of the lesion. The images also reveal a highly
pleomorphic population of squamous epithelial cells. The cells vary from clearly squamous cell in appearance to
spindle shaped. The cells exhibit anisokaryosis, nuclear pleomorphism, multinucleation, and nuclear chromatin
clumping. Some of the cells have cytoplasmic basophilia and perinuclear vacuolation. These cells are considered to
be neoplastic squamous epithelial cells.

The colon was markedly distended with an intralumenal mucinous clot. There were no formed feces present in the
intestine and/or rectum.All other organ systems appeared normal. within the lumen of the intestines, there was a
coagulum of fibrin, mucus, heterophils, sloughed epithelium, and necrotic debris. Multifocally, intestinal crypts 
 were disorganized and contained an occasional vacuolated epithelium and intralumenal necrotic debris. Attached 
to the villous surface epithelium and occasionally intracellular, there were numerous, small, 1-5 μm in diameter,
circular basophilic foci that were consistent with Cryptosporidium.
 Therefore, a diagnosis of intestinal
cryptosporidiosis was made.

History
The gecko was relinquished to a nearby reptile shelter 3 days prior to presentation due to sudden anorexia and
lethargy. The shelter staff noticed the swollen joints and presented him to the hospital. They reported that the
previous owner claimed this was a sudden onset and that the lizard had not been eating well. The animal had not
eaten at all while at the shelter.

Summary
Articular gout or other forms of gout in lizards are the result of precipitation of uric acid from increased levels of 
uric acid due to dehydration, renal disease, or other chronic disease processes (Nevarez, 2009). Due to the
advanced lesions in this case, euthanasia was elected.A full necropsy was not pursued; however, closer
examination of the shoulder lesion revealed that the white material surrounding the left shoulder joint was chalky
and extended deep within the joint.

however, there was a possibility that this was a normal value for this species. The calcium-phosphorus ratio was
inverted for most healthy animals and because the calcium appeared normal suggested either excessive
phosphorus intake or decreased phosphorus excretion. The total protein concentration appeared low, but could
be normal for this species. The cholesterol concentration seemed high and was suggestive of a lipid disorder that
supported the cytological and histological findings on the skin biopsy.

Summary
Histology of the biopsy indicated a chronic granu-lomatous dermatitis and offered a primary dyslipidosis as the
cause. Microbial culture of the biopsy site revealed a mixture of bacteria that grew in low numbers and included
Citrobacter sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia colil,and Favobacterium sp. These organisms were likely
contaminants and not significant. Mycobacterium culture was negative.
Because the fish was chronically ill and had not eaten for along while, the possibility that the lesions may indeed
represent mycobacteriosis, a potentially zoonotic disease, and the severity of the animal's condition and poor

Summary
Because of the location and apparent bony involvement of the lesion, the fish was euthanized with an overdose of
tricaine methanesulfonate in the water. The necropsy revealed a well-circumscribed mass that extended deep into
the operculum tissue. The tissue was very firm, difficult to remove, and the solid and white cut surface had a chalk-
like texture (Figs. 92.5a and 92.5b)
Histopathologic results revealed the mass consisted of cartilage; however, the cartilage proliferated in a
somewhat haphazard fashion. Cells were embedded within lacunae within a cartilaginous matrix. Nuclei were
mildly pleomorphic, round, and had small nucleoli. Mitoses were not observed. Centrally, there were areas of 
ossification of the cartilage in the formation of bone. The histopathologic diagnosis was a chondrosarcoma.
