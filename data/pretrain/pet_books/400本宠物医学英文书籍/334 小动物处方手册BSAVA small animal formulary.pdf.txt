Preface to the seventh edition
Welcome to the 7th edition of the BSAVA Small Animal Formulary.All
of the editors hope you find it a useful resource. It contains many new
drugs and a few drugs have also been deleted as they were not
available at the time of publication. Most of the monographs have
been revised and many new doses added for the less common pets.
The appendiceshave also been extensivelyrevised.
Since the last edition, the prescribing practices and pharmacy
protocols of veterinary practices have come under renewed scrutiny.
Practices must now be registered to store and supply veterinary
medicines and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate have established
an inspectorate that has already visited many practices. All readers
are advised to consult the BSAVA Guide to the Use of Veterinary
Medicines (available at www.bsava.com) and to make sure that
their prescribing policies and practices comply with existing
guidelines and legislation. There are also many other useful
websites and organizations that publish literature relevant to
use of these sources of information.
The veterinary profession's use of antibacterials is increasingly under
the spotlight. The section on antibacterial selection in the Appendix
All practitioners should read this and reflect on their prescribing
practices. A practice policy for prescribing antibacterial drugs is
recommended.

Off-label' use of medicines
‘Off-label' use is the use of medicines outside the terms of their
marketing authorization. It may include medicines authorized outside
the UK that are used in accordance with an import certificate issued
by the VMD. A veterinary surgeon with detailed knowledge of the
medical history and clinical status of a patient, may reasonably
prescribe a medicine 'off-label' in accordance with the prescribing
cascade.Authorized medicines have been scientifically assessed

Medicines may be used 'off-label' for a variety of reasons including:

 An authorized product has proved ineffective in the
circumstances of a particular case(all cases of suspected lack
of efficacy of authorized veterinary medicines should be
reported to the VMD).
Responsibility for the use of a medicine 'off-label lies solely with
the prescribing veterinary surgeon. He or she should inform the

30BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7theditior
Adverse reactions: Most frequently seen in geriatric patients with
chronic heart disease or in patients with acute or decompensated
heart failure. Include bradycardia, AV block, myocardial depression,
B
and diarrhoea. Depression and lethargy may occur as a result of
C
atenolol's high lipid solubility and its penetration into the CNS.
D
Drug interactions: Hypertension may develop when given with
sympathomimetics (e.g. adrenaline, noradrenaline). The hypotensive

effect of atenolol is enhanced by many agents that depress
myocardial activity including anaesthetic agents, phenothiazines,
F
antihypertensive drugs, diuretics and diazepam. There is an
increased risk of bradycardia, severe hypotension, heart failure and
G
AV block if atenolol is used concurrently with calcium channel
blockers. Concurrent digoxin administration potentiates bradycardia.
H
The metabolism of atenolol is accelerated by thyroid hormones; thus
the dose of atenolol may need to be decreased when initiating
carbimazole therapy. Atenolol enhances the effects of muscle
relaxants (e.g. suxamethonium, tubocurarine). Hepatic enzyme
induction by phenobarbital may increase the rate of metabolism of
atenolol. The bronchodilatory effects of theophylline may be blocked

not fully understood.

Use: Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. lsoflurane is potent
and highly volatile so should only be delivered from a suitable
calibrated vaporizer. It is less soluble in blood than halothane but

The concentration of isoflurane required to maintain anaesthesia
depends on the other drugs used in the anaesthesia protocol; the

Isoflurane has a pungent smell and induction to anaesthesia using

effect does not wane with time. Isoflurane is a more potent respiratory
Isoflurane does not sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines to the
extent that halothane does, but can generate arrhythmias in certain
M
conditions. Assertions that isoflurane is safer than halothane in certain
high-risk cases should be discounted.lsoflurane is not metabolized by
N
the liver (0.2%) and has less effect on liver blood flow compared with
halothane. In ferrets isoflurane can cause marked depression in
0
haematological parameters (especially haematocrit, RBC count, Hb
concentration) rapidly after induction, so care should be taken in
P
interpreting blood results if isoflurane is used for restraint, or in
anaemic ordebilitatedferrets.
Q
Drug interactions: Opioid agonists, benzodiazepines and NO
reduce the concentration of isoflurane required to achieve surgical

anaesthesia. The duration of action of non-depolarizing
neuromuscular blocking agents is longer with isoflurane compared
s
withhalothane anaesthetized animals.

the development of hypertension.
Drug interactions: Hypertension may develop when given with
sympathomimetics (e.g. adrenaline, noradrenaline). The hypotensive
effect of propranolol is enhanced by many agents that depress
BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition307
myocardial activity including anaesthetic agents, phenothiazines,
antihypertensive drugs, diuretics and diazepam. There is an
increased risk of bradycardia, severe hypotension, heart failure and
AVblock if propranolol is used concurrentlywithcalciumchannel
B
blockers. Concurrent digoxin administration potentiates bradycardia.
The metabolism of propranolol is accelerated by thyroid hormones,
C
thus reducing its effect. The dose of propranolol may need to be
D
decreased when initiating carbimazole therapy.Oral aluminium
hydroxide preparations reduce propranolol absorption. Cimetidine
E
may decrease the metabolism of propranolol, thereby increasing its
blood levels. Propranolol enhances the effects of muscle relaxants

(e.g. suxamethonium, tubocurarine). Hepatic enzyme induction by
phenobarbital or phenytoin may increase the rate of metabolism of

Formulations: Oral: 50 mg tablets; 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg
extended release tablets; 5 mg/ml oral liquid. Injectable: 50 mg/ml
solution (only available by importation into the UK).
Action: Agonist properties at all opioid receptors but particularly at
mu receptors. It also inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-HT,
K
and stimulates presynaptic 5-HT release, which provides an
alternative pathway for analgesia involving the descending inhibitory
pathways within the spinal cord.
Use: Management of mild to moderate acute pain. Used as an

from osteoarthritis or neoplasia. Increasing body of literature

pain because it can be given orally and is not subject to controlled
drug regulations. Cats seem to be more susceptible to the dysphoric
effects of tramadol; accurate dosing is important but can be difficult
to cats and therefore difficult to administer.

Veterinary Medicines (available at www.bsava.com) and individual
drug monographs. It is important that the veterinary profession uses

It is important to remember that antimicrobials do not make
by
organisms resistant, but they do create selective pressure on
populations of organisms. Resistance may be inherent, evolved (by
chromosomal DNA changes) or acquired (by plasmid transfer).
Resistance is reduced by the following:
1. Reducing the expectation of antibacterial prescriptions.

2. Minimizing and ideally avoiding prophylactic use.

to be at increased risk due to concurrent disease or
immunosuppressant therapy and is in contact with other
infected animals
b.  Prophylactic antimicrobial use may be appropriate in the

good asepsis. Examples of appropriate criteria for
perioperative antimicrobial use include:
Prolonged surgical procedures (>1.5 hours)

Wherethereisanobviousidentifiedbreakinasepsis
Bowel surgery with a risk of leakage

Contaminated wounds.
c. In most cases appropriate antimicrobials to use would be an
intravenous preparation of amoxicillin/clavulanate or a first
generation cephalosporinadministered atinduction and
situations where anaerobic involvement is highly likely
(e.g. periodontal disease), the addition or substitution of
metronidazole would be appropriate. In the case of bowel
leakage, a combination of antimicrobials may be most
appropriate, e.g. ampicillin combined with an aminoglycoside
or a fluoroquinolone.

3. Culturing appropriate material for sensitivity testing.
Appendix
a. The results from culture and sensitivity tests considerably
assist the choice of whichantimicrobial to use.
b. Culture is not required in every case, but when prolonged
courses of antimicrobials are likely to be needed (e.g.
pyodermas, otitis externa, deep or surgical wound infections)
thenculturewill improve the animal's treatment.
4. Knowing the features of antimicrobials. There are three key
areas that veterinary surgeons must have a working knowledge of.
Index
a. Spectrum of activity. Many of the antimicrobials in routine
veterinary use are broad-spectrum; however, to minimize
resistance the narrowest spectrum agent should be chosen.
by
Some specific examples of spectra covered are:
Anaerobes - metronidazole, clindamycin, many of the
therapeutic
penicillins (especially the narrow-spectrum penicillins
such as Penicillin G) and cephalosporins
Gram-positive bacteria - penicillins, cephalosporins,
lincosamides and macrolides
Gram-negative bacteria - aminoglycosides and
fluoroquinolones.
class
b.Distribution. Many of the antimicrobial classes are well
distributed around the body, and it is important to be aware of
some of the specifics of distribution. Key examples include:
Aminoglycosides are poorly distributed. They are not
absorbed from the Gl tract and even if given
systemically distribution can be quite restricted.
Conversely, it means that they are very appropriate for

treatment or pre-existing conditions.

C. Is the antimicrobial time- or concentration-dependent?

suppression of normal bacterial flora, resulting in overgrowth of other
species, notably Clostridium, resulting in enterotoxaemia and death.
Mice,rats,ferrets andusually gerbils are fairlyresistant,whereas
hamsters, guinea pigs, chinchillas and rabbits are more susceptible.
The risk of enterotoxaemia is related to several factors, including the
drug selected, the dose, the route of administration and the animal's
nutritional status and general health. In general, penicillins,
clindamycin and lincomycin are more likely to cause enterotoxaemia
aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole and
sulphonamides pose the least risk. Tetracyclines are risky in the
guinea pig but appear less so in other species (Prescott et al., 2000).

Ketamine is relatively safe in ill animals, but high doses cause
prolonged recoveries and are associated with muscle rigidity.
Acepromazine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) with midazolam (0.25 mg/kg) or
diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) and ketamine at 2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg, mixed

(5 mg/kg) may be required if given i.m. This combination is
preferred over ketamine/acepromazine combinations in sick
cats. Diazepam can cause pain on injection, therefore use of
midazolam is preferred.

Ketamine (5 mg/kg) with medetomidine 10-40 μg (micrograms)/kg

renal disease or urinary tract obstruction. However, low doses should
beused insuchcases.
Alfaxalone: Although not authorized for this use, 2 mg/kg i.m. will
provide sedation in cats lasting 10-15 minutes.
Generalnotes:
A crush cage is useful for restraining violent cats for i.m.
injection. If injection of sedatives proves impossible,
anaesthesia can be induced using a large induction chamber
into which volatile anaesthetic agents can be delivered via an
anaesthetic machine. Most of the aforementioned combinations
